<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c40">接收榆關與遠東形勢　舒 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>臨榆自去年一月一日失陷以後。繼以熱河之被蹂躪。平津之受威脅。整個中國幾將完全脫離平時狀態。迨塘沽恊定成立。中日間此種變相的戰爭。雖告停頓。而灤東紛擾。日軍一再縱容。我國又不能直接進剿。致使我灤東民衆。皆陷於二重痛苦。引領東望。誠不勝其悲憤者也。頃者日本外交政策。爲技術的變更。故有較爲和緩之表示。是以長城各口隘。有收回交涉。天下第一關之臨榆。亦傳將於本月十日收回。吾人在此接收之前。痛定思痛。不能不略貢所見。冀國人對於當前國際形勢。尤其是遠東形勢。有重新之認識與更進一步之估量也。</p>
<p>第一。吾人須認識此次山海關之收回。並非日人有所覺悟欲於根本上和好中國而自願交還。特爲外交上一種政策之變更。一則圖緩和我國民一時之憤怒。再以鬆懈國際間一時緊張之情勢耳。况津東一帶。伏莽充斥。荆棘遍地。我若不努力求治。則轉資敵方之口實。貽國際間以笑柄。我若舉賢任能。切實整理。則將到處受人掣肘。招致未來之糾紛。我國外交問題處理之困難。正未有已。</p>
<p>第二。吾人須知我國領土之喪失。兩年餘以來。何止灤東。更何止臨榆一關。四百二十餘萬方里之地積。三千餘萬民衆之損失。正隠忍受辱而莫可如何設使臨榆果能如期收回。我人民不當認爲卽此已足。而當益加奮勉以圖所以自振。　第三。吾人須知自九一八事變後。列國除以精神同情爲道德的援助外。實無其他辦法。我國進旣不能以實力圖恢復。退亦難以保守四境。我國之形勢已其可危。今者列國對日爲經濟上之鬭爭。甚爲劇烈彼日人亦自知其天賦。資源。工業組織。軍隊素質。皆具有不易彌補之缺點。故乃突變其外交方針。暫以保守開發爲原則。然而此經濟鬭爭。終必有成爲武力鬭爭之日。當此時也。我國欲圖以武裝保持和平。旣不可能。嚴正中立。未見其可。卽欲加入任何一方。尤爲勢所不許。則宜乘此變局未定各國凖備未週之際。應作深切之認識。圖自强之善道。</p>
<p>吾人於上述三者之外。更須進一步對世界大勢作明細之分析。於遠東尤須有具體之觀察。現在日本已不敢再作軍事冒險。轉而企圖保持其旣得之勝利。務使其所謂（日滿統制經濟。）能逐步實現。則煤鐵可以無虞。農産品可以自給。對美對蘇。皆有週轉餘地。而將來在他人國境内戰爭。終是高一着之打算。此則一九零四年日俄戰爭之故智也。至於英日與美日之間。所爭者皆屬市塲獨占問題。在最短期内。美國固未必越太平洋以採取軍事的攻勢。日本更無略取美洲之野心。設使中日間而果稍緩和者。則日本開拓東方市塲之便利。自遠甚於美國之運用。英國目前情勢。亦祗在維持旣得利益之現狀。使所謂帝國以内之經濟聯盟。能堅確樹立。克服其各自治領殖民地之離心傾向。則其海軍前衛根據地香港。自必因新嘉坡軍港之築成。而有確實之保障。遠東市塲之特權。亦不至於頽墜。吾人審度遠東形勢。瞻觀太平洋大局。應卽發爲深切之反省。萬不宜再蹈以往苟安之覆轍矧榆關交還。在人固未必爲覺醒之表示。在我則應作沉痛靜默之認識。勾踐復國之遺訓。終當爲我國人之古鑑也。</p>

<p>英報發表日本攻俄密計</p>
<p>俄日在美訂購大批鋼鐵　　（華盛頓）據某大鋼鐵廠代表語記者、俄國擬在美訂購價値數百萬元之鋼鐵、最近俄國曾向美國一千六百餘家鋼鐵廠探詢一切價目、大都關於採油礦用之鋼管及鋼軌並其他運輸用之物料、以備一旦與日本交戰時應用云、現在總統及金融善後局總董瓊斯所籌設之國家貿易銀行、或可接受此項信用放欵、但最近美俄間有互惠通商恊定、而俄國亦將有大批出口貨輸入美國、故兩國間貿易所須現金甚少、據美商務部報告、去年十二月美國對俄輸出爲五七○·二六九元、前年僅爲一八六·三一○元、</p>
<p>而俄貨輸入美國去年十二月共有一·○七一·五五○元、較前年增加五五二·八一七元、俄國年來極力購買鋼鐵物料、以備日俄之戰、而同時日本亦在積極籌備、去年日本在美訂購鋼鐵、爲數亦屬不小、總計有五九二·五三六噸、較前年增加四○一·三四三噸、按美國去年全年共輸出鋼鐵一·三五○·六九二噸、全國總輸出爲一·六七五·○二○·○○○元、其中棉花出口最多佔三九八·二一二·二六三元云、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>絲茶亟須改良昨據國際貿易局局長何炳賢、及指導處主任季澤晋談、我國與紐絲蘭貿易情形、並其失敗緣由云、華貨銷紐以硬毁菓絲布等爲大宗、上年（一九三二年）一年輸入貨價、値紐金八萬二千一百十五鎊、較之一九三一年輸入額、减少二千六百餘磅、而較之一九二八年輸入額、减少五萬四千五百餘鎊、考其原因、最大者、厥爲世界不景氣所致、近二三年來、紐地工人失業甚多、購買力大爲薄弱、各國運紐貨物皆受影響、然華貨中亦有數種、因受競爭喪失市塲、如以茶絲兩項而言、原係我國特著産品、紐地市塲、本我獨佔、近年來受他國茶絲之競爭、我國茶絲輸入銳减、逐年衰落、昔日我之茶絲市塲、盡爲印度錫蘭茶英日絲所佔奪、失敗之原因、如以茶論、一係包裝失佳、墨守成法、華紐相距遙遠、且中隔熱帶、茶竟多仍紙包、迨抵紐後、茶味散失、次之、華商信用殊欠穏固、所寄樣品與貨物不符、往往樣品甚佳、而貨物極劣、喪失紐商之信用、次之、紐絲蘭</p>
<p>對於英屬産物進口、課以優遇稅、華茶納稅較重、所耗成本、或亦稍多、售價甚昂、遂爲印度錫蘭茶所敗、再以絲論、華絲色染未臻上乘、質料堅厚、但價太貴、難與賤價之日絲爭長、蓋絲綢等品類裁製婦女時裝、花樣欵式、日新月異、故華綢質地雖經久耐用、顧不爲所重、計自一九二八年以來、華貨銷紐貨値額、年漸低落、其因世界不景氣所致者、待至世界繁榮日固、可望增加華貨輸入、但如茶絲等、因受競爭喪失市塲、若不改補已短、安能與人爭勝、又安能恢復舊規云</p>

<p>受損失提請詳加覆議轉呈政府迅予改善書（續）黃子屏</p>
<p>然此猶就捲菸業而言也、若論土菸葉、則損失亦屬不菲、蓋下菸全用土葉製造、下菸以稅重而不競、土菸葉亦必隨而滯銷、依民衆等菸公司之統計、宿松黃岡新昌鄧州冠軍廣水均州等處所産土菸葉、在民國十九年前七級稅時、每年約銷卅九萬包、十九年十一月改三級稅後、卽減至廿六萬包、廿一年改二級稅後、又減爲十一萬五千包、最近改稅、聞此項菸葉、幾至無人過問、九江老河口、稅署均設有土菸辦事處、擬請轉函稅署飭令查復、必能得其眞相、現行稅制、土菸每百斤收稅四元一角四分、倘因此不銷、則政府稅收之損失幾何、菸農因而破産、農村之損失又幾何、是又不可以數字計也、凡此皆於國本及民族經濟關係甚切、定稅率者、如以中國及中華民族爲重、不能不一計及之也、竊謂二級稅之謬誤、全在上菸減稅、而下菸加稅、蓋上菸價貴、下菸價賤、就七級稅言、上菸每箱售價一零五二元、稅銀四零四元、七級菸每箱售價一二五元、稅銀二九元、是取賦稅平均之原則、按値抽稅、則上菸一箱之稅、足抵下菸十數箱而有餘、故欲稅收之充裕、卽不注重上菸、亦必令上中下菸同一待</p>
<p>遇、萬不能專向下菸着想也、茲姑就上述、假定政府必須增籌捲菸稅三百八十萬元、倘不專責於華商之下菸、而令英美之上菸亦分擔之、則讓一步、以各任半數計、華商只須增加負擔一百九十萬元而已、何致全任一千四百餘萬元之重稅、若謂不論人民之負擔能力如何、必令華商多任</p>
<p>一千四百餘萬元之稅、而英美亦同等負擔之、則英美銷菸之數量、旣多於華商、而所銷者、又爲價貴之上菸、按値加稅、英美納稅數目、必同時增加三千萬元以上、政府之收入、合之卽可年增五千萬元、是政府爲增益稅收計、必須對上中下菸課以同等之稅、其理至淺、若二級稅、則下菸加稅過重、上菸稅率過輕、徒令華商損失無窮、英美坐享厚利、眞可謂有百害而無一利者矣、然此猶就廿一年之二級稅而言也、若今之二級稅、則一級菸絕無僅有、幾等於零、實收者、只餘第二𤆣、是直一級稅而已、下菸由每箱五十五元加爲每箱八十元、比前愈增、上菸由每箱九十五元減爲八十元、比前愈減、現在行之未久、華商之損失幾何、英美之利益幾何、未獲明確之數字統計、然按前法推算、大槪華商之損失、當爲全年二千餘萬元、英美之利益、至少當爲一千六七百萬元、倘必繼續施行、將見此僅存之華商四五十家、亦必陸續倒閉、國産土菸葉全數消滅、湖北江西安徽菸農、隨而破産、嗚呼、政府本爲國民之政府、想斷不忍作英美之工具、殺盡華商煙農、并以國産土煙葉及土煙稅爲殉葬品、令英美安坐而吮吸華商每年一千六七百萬元之膏血也、是則亟宜急起直追、立予廢止、不容有斯須之猶疑矣、或謂如上所言、則現行稅制、下煙每箱收稅八十元、上中煙按等酌加、豈非籌欵之妙術乎、則又竊謂不然、蓋下煙每箱收稅八十元、乃値百抽一百二十之重稅、斷非此時之民力所</p>

<p>讀書指導：　　申報讀者顧問取消了，使我無限的惆悵！現在讀書指導成立了，使我無限的歡欣！眞的，讀了幾日來的讀書問答，增加了我不少新的知識。但是，我的問題都不類似那些，而且，讀書各人有各人的計劃，所以我趁這僅有一小時的時間，寫成這（我的一年讀書計劃），就正於諸位先生之前。　　我是一個知識的飢荒者，深深地感到文字不够用的痛苦，拿起筆來，不能表示自已的意思；拿起書來，稍深的就不能看懂。所以，我不敢瞎研究什麽，我祗努力求（國文在水平淺以上）的實踐。爲便明瞭起見，將我的種種，縷述於後。</p>
<p>我的環境｜｜我現在是在一個小鄕鎭上一家商店内做學徒，每日雖然連一小時的時間都没有，但我已下了决心，待廢曆過年後，將這行業辭去不幹了。（不幹的原因：終日終月終年的勞働着，而酬報則僅僅每年大洋三十元！而且，就是將來也無好出路。因爲一時找不到適當的職業，故擬此（一年讀書計劃），回老家去自修一年再說，好在老家還供給得起我這個廢物的衣食。）那時有充分的時間，寗靜的生活，安心自修，是定可以辦到的。</p>
<p>我的程度｜｜進過初中一學期，出來便落下了這陷阱｜｜商店。雖然看過不少的小說，｜｜新舊都有｜｜然亦僅僅看看而已，大多没有細細的讀過。古文不看注釋就看不懂，新詩太新了，又不了解。如現代中的詩，我就不够資格欣賞。說來慚愧，我的國文似乎没有一些基礎，然而我還年靑，｜｜今年十八歲｜｜只要我能努力，總能達到我的希望吧？</p>
<p>我的希望｜｜我不希望做文人（這是夢想），我祇希望我能够看懂一切的古籍，能够欣賞如現代中的詩；拿起筆來，能够如意地表出我的意思。總之，我祗希望做一個（國文在水平綫以上）者。</p>
<p>一年讀書的計劃｜｜每日選讀古文一篇，要讀得爛熟。看書若干頁（古書或新書，規定一年中要看幾部。）此外定一份雜誌，一份報。每日爲寫字若干，每週作文幾篇，一一都有規定。這是我一年的計劃，至於這樣是否能够達到我的希望，那是另一椿事，因爲我這僅僅是的計劃一階段而已。</p>
<p>我只能很膚淺地寫出如上的計劃，實在的，我不能再寫得好些了。希望先生加以改正，或者另外代訂一（一年自修計劃課程表）。在這裏，還有許多問題，讓我一齊寫在下面：（一）像我這樣的人，對於上面的希望太奢了嗎？（二）應讀些什麽古文？看些什麽書籍？（望詳開書目）（三）作文應做那一類的？做小說行麽？（四）進商務印書館的函授學社有益否？（五）應多看什麽書籍？什麽書籍是我最宜的？（規定範圍，以免茫茫學海毫無頭緒。）　　上列五問，希一併答覆。我深深地希望着，希望着先生爲我訂正後的計劃，能誘導我進於一種規定的讀書程序之中，依一定之目的，循預定之步驟逼進。</p>
<p>我在這裏深深的企着。（程克嬰來信）更正：一、昨日的標題應改爲（讀書的邏輯）。二、李思齊名字上還要加上括弧（　）並（來信）二字三、第三列第一行（而且）下（，）不要，應加上一個（個），成爲（個人的目的······）</p>

<h3 id="c163">放寒假 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>記得寒假放兩星期，由一月十八日起，至三十一日止，是敎育部規定的，大中小學一律的。這兩週的寒假，有的年頭適逢其會</p>
<p>廢歷的年頭歲尾也在裏頭，今年可不巧了。下學期開始的二月一日，，在廢歷還祗是十二月十八日，就是廢歷十二月十八日開學，廢歷年初一也要上課的了。因此各校今年的放寒假，也就大變通而特變通，不管違反敎育部或敎育局的命令了。鄕間學校不必說，就是敎師不放廢歷新年，學生也會得放先生的。以上海來說：某大學放一個月，由</p>
<p>廢歷歲尾到年頭；某中學放三星期，由一月中旬到二月中旬；某小學在廢歷十二月二十七八開學，而最多的就是這在廢歷年底開學。放過廢歷年而開學的，他們的理由是：社會上依然是過廢歷年，年底大家忙着過年，大家金錢緊迫得要命，如果在年内開學，學生那裏來錢繳納一切學費膳費等等呢？他們是體恤學生家長在年内難於籌費，而不肯任學生入了校到過了年繳費，怕的是進了校收不到他們的費。在年底開學的。則因爲開學最初一星期本不能上課，名爲年内開學，實際等於放過年初一，就是學生也决不會在年底來校的。而一方面則在年内終算開學了，也算不違反上司的功令，這一個辦法，是最取巧没有了。</p>
<p>放寒假日期雖有規定，而各校竟放到這樣形形色色，不知主管機關將如何維持他的威信？但是放開眼光來看，那一件事又能令出必行威信顯著的呢？這一件極平凡的放寒假事，馬虎過去了，又算得什麽呢？</p>
<h3 id="c164">闢謠 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>楊公館裏的三小姐，幽居深閨，輕易不出門的，雖然大家都不很提伊的芳名，可是提到了伊的芳名，那便誰都承認伊是冰淸玉潔的。但是，最近，忽地有人在外傳說，在某月某日，楊三小姐與某人在某處幽會。這一回子事，本是空中樓閣，不足置信的。若是被誣者付之一笑，那麽，不久自會謠止於智者，而没人談起了。可是楊三小姐却偏大張旗鼓的登報闢謠，同時再用法律手續，追究造謠者。這麽一閙，凖會閙得滿城風雨，婦孺皆知。雖然到底終有水落石出的一天，可是在一般人腦筋中，便不免留下了甚深的一個惡印象。甚至於有人附會着說，楊三小姐或許是幹過這麽一回事，否則淸者自淸，濁者自濁，何必如此小題大做呢？</p>
<p>論理，闢謠，自然是一種正當的手續，但是在這年頭兒，（謠）也有些兒變了，竟如一個頑皮小孩子。近代敎育家，都不主張對小孩子鞭笞，更其時對於頑皮的孩子。的確，我們時常可以見到躁</p>
<p>急的母親，鞭笞頑皮的孩子。越是鞭笞，孩子越是頑皮。懂得敎育原理的母親，對於孩子們，總是循循善誘的，倒能敎育出很好的孩子。（謠），也是如此。例如上述楊三小姐的故事。倘使楊三小</p>
<p>姐對於空穴來風，只當是一個頑皮的孩子，而儘把自已冰淸玉潔的事實給人看，（謠）便根本不攻自破了。</p>
<p>在上海，有些人給綁匪綁去了，新聞記者按址去訪問，被綁者的家屬，却儘着搖頭否認有這麽一回子事。自然，這麽着，消息便不容易張揚開去，這比了鄭重其事的闢謠，收着相反的效果，這</p>
<p>眞是値得崇拜的一種精神。</p>
<h3 id="c165">重樓隨筆 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>計劃</p>
<p>（計劃）和（希望）是不同的，希望永遠是空虚的幻想，計劃却有實現的可能。</p>
<p>（一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨）。這樣，人是在時間的前面已經確定了他的計劃。</p>
<p>我們如果把人比作車輛，那麽計劃就是軌道，有了穏固的軌道，才能平安的行車。可知事實無論大小，都應該有精密的計劃，雖然計劃不一定完全能够實現，但至少它可以减少失敗的成分。</p>
<p>環境</p>
<p>環境是人造的，但人却都怨恨着環境，於是形成了一種極端的矛盾！</p>
<p>譬如生活在都市裏的人們，他們一方面咒詛着都市，一方面又劉戀着都市，他們不滿意目前的環境，又不能拿勇氣改造環境！</p>
<p>我們相信環境是能够轉移人的，但它只能轉移意志薄弱的人；意志堅强的人，處處能够戰勝惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>朋友們：我們同來做一隊和環境奮鬥的戰士吧！</p>
<p>體騐</p>
<p>在偉大的宇宙中，包含着各式的現象；在人生的過程中，包含着種種的滋味；只有體騐才能從這偉大的宇宙中嘗到種種的滋味。</p>
<p>一個科學家他能發明空前的物理，一個哲學家他能吐出驚人的言論，一個藝術家他能寫出美妙的詩句或畫圖，···這些都是從體騐中得來的，誰能說體騐是多事呢。</p>
<p>俄國大文豪屠格湼夫，他願意捨棄貴族生活做一個流浪者，而他在流浪的體騐中終　獲得很大的事業。</p>
<p>所以體騐不單是一種親切的敎訓，並且是一種成功的階梯。</p>

<p>他說這話是很自然的，可是自强聽到，只覺一字一針，針</p>
<p>針揷在心尖上，雖然心裏頭要用兩句話去安慰桂枝，然而口舌不聽自已的指揮，却是一句話也說不出來。江氏在一邊看到他突立着，兩手直垂，若不是微低了頭，倒好像是和新夫人立正，這就向他道：姑爺，你放心罷。我們不是那樣不懂事的人，你旣然是請假回來，公事依然在身。你自已瞧着辦罷。</p>
<p>應該今天動身就今天動身，若是能遲一天，明日走就從容些。老太爺，你說我這話怎麽樣說着，將臉朝了趙翁。趙翁道：親家太太，你說這話，就是二十四分疼姑爺的了。我們孩子們還有什麽話說呀。自强，我看今天走是來不及的了。好在電報雖是來了，可也没有限定你那一天到，比較，從容一點的話，你還是明天走罷。自强這才開口道：是的，我也算了，明天早上六點半鐘車子進城，趕東站八點鐘到山海關的火車。我還是由灤州下車，走旱道回去。趙翁道：這都聽便着你。說時，他的手，不住的抬起來，一下一下的，將報子向下抹，好像這個動作，就可以解除心中的苦悶，江氏向桂枝道：你回家去坐罷，他聽說，跟着娘後面走了。自强向趙翁道：據我看呢，前方事情是没有事情，只是寳營長他離不開我。趙翁道：不過軍營裏規矩除了前線在開火而外，只要是請婚假，總是請得動的，爲什麽他不等你假期滿着，就打電報催你。這裏面，我怕總有</p>
<p>一些原因吧？自强怎敢說是有原因，站定了没有作聲。（二三九）</p>
<h3 id="c168">歲寒三友 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>松竹梅，是歲寒三友，前幾天蘇州大雪漫天，正是歲寒三友大出風頭的日子，在白茫茫一片之中，有蒼松翠竹紅梅，點綴其間，多麽來得好看，</p>
<p>從前的詩人，讚美楓葉，比二月花還美麗，還但是到了歲殘的時候，松竹梅挺秀爭妍，更加比楓葉美麗十倍了。</p>
<p>古人比喻松是大夫，我比它是忠勇之士，不變其節，我常常說一二八時代的</p>
<p>十九路軍，是松一般倔强，不畏强鄰的欺侮，一如松在白雪中，透露它的英姿，自從閩變之後，覺得十九路軍，不及松的不變其節，倔强到底了。</p>
<p>古人比喻竹是君子，我比它是懷才之徒，在平日的時候，看不出他的眞才實學，同時也不顯其所能，埋没一生，到風雲際會之時，龐鳳雛非百里才，人家所不能，他無有不能了。一生孤高，不受人憐，保守他的本來精神，懷抱，一塵不染，眞所謂阮籍猖狂，豈是販夫走卒之徒？可惜愛竹愛才的人不見其多呢　古人比喻梅是美人，我比它是樸素之婦，在不景氣之下，要得一個儉爲美德的女人，實在很少，所謂時代美人，也不過像野獅野貓一般吧了！貞操不談，奢華是尚，弄得世風日下，人心欺詐，</p>
<p>我覺得梅花是冷芳，是孤高，一點没有畏懼的態度，無怪林處士愛之如妻了。　咳！茫茫塵世，像大雪中的松竹梅一般的人，可有多少啊。</p>
<p>新發明</p>
<h3 id="c169">酒中含有維太命Ｂ２ <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>最近日本大阪市立衛生試騐所研究生山田丰，得所長藤原九十郎博士的指導，發明維太命在化學史上的新資料。他把各種酒類分析研究的結果，發現了酒中含有維太命Ｂ２，這維太命Ｂ２，爲人體上營養分中的主要成分，因爲維太命Ｂ，可分爲１·２·３·４·５五種，維太命１，富有預防脚氣的功用，維太命Ｂ，有促進身體各部分發育的效能。山田氏的論文，證明酒中所含的維太命，是把麥酒葡萄酒日本酒紹興酒數種比較實騐的，而紹興酒中的阿爾可爾爲最少，但是維太命爲最多。所以在法律上，禁止未成年者吃酒，認爲不當，因爲吃了酒，變了面紅耳赤四肢溫暖，就是刺激血管膨賬的表現，也就是維太命Ｂ２的起了作用，促進身體發育的機能，所以神經衰弱血色枯萎的人，吃些陳年的紹興酒，確有莫大的功效。我們中國人傳下來的各種藥酒，除了藥性能够袪除病症外，其裨益於身體最大的，就是靠酒中的維太命Ｂ２。山田氏曾經把白鼠仔細的實騐，發表意見，他說：用三十克蘭姆的白鼠，以低溫低壓，在日本酒麥酒葡萄酒，紹興酒中，除去了阿爾可爾與水分可使，成了一種濃縮液，我們如加以缺少維太命Ｂ２的飼料，養育白鼠，與不加這濃縮液的飼料，養育白鼠，兩者比較起來，其發育的結果，不吃濃縮液的白鼠，不到五十餘天就要死了，加有葡萄酒的濃液縮的飼料，那可活到八十七日，倘若加入啤酒日本酒紹興酒，那可生存到百天以上的，所以白鼠的體重，如加入酒類的濃縮液爲飼料，可以達到二百十克蘭姆，因此證明酒中的維太命Ｂ２，有發育促進身體的機能大功效的。</p>
<h3 id="c170">煤油可以治肺病 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>吃煤油能够治療肺病的實騐，現在東西各國已有事實證明。起初是發現于一自殺的女郎身上，就是有一家馬車行的女兒，因爲患了肺病，厭世自殺，</p>
<p>他暗地裏飲了一瓶煤油，以爲可與世間永訣了，那知飲了煤油以後，他的肺病，霍然大愈，於是驚動了社會。後來醫生就把煤油來試騐，果然屢試屢騐，而且斷定喉頭結核，痔瘻，脊椎加里愛司等結核病以及糖尿病，喘息等病，都有大效，從前世界上學者對于醫肺病的藥，不知多少，可是都有害無益，其後對于治療的方法，都主張安靜，轉地療養，攝生營養，吸收新鮮空氣等自然療法，然而總不能從根本上治療。到了現在，經過著名醫家化學家，在動物上實騐結果，都認煤油爲撲滅結核病的無上妙藥了。聽說日本岡山縣地方，有一位資本家，因爲常吃煤油，竟活了百十三歲的壽命，山口縣下松的油煤公司内做工的人，没有一個人患肺病的人，兵庫縣立兒童研究所所長醫學博士速水寅一，用煤油三十克蘭姆，分數次飲用，竟把胃腸腎贜的各種疾病除盡，他在結核菌的培養器中，滴了煤油一滴，那結核菌，竟完全死滅，證明煤油有强烈的殺菌作用，他後來再在兎的身上試騐，又收奇效，其鄰人自十年前患肺病以來，兩肺幾如蜂窠樣子，已經到了第三期的危境，他用十五克蘭姆煤油，每天令他飲服，不到一個月，果然完全斷根。飲的方法，依年齡與體格不同，大槪初時飲十克蘭姆，最多飲到十五克蘭姆爲度，飲的時間，以午後九點爲最宜，但是不可吃夜飯，到九點臨睡時飲服，隔了四五日，再飲第二次，隔了六七日，再飲第三次，如此逐漸增加至十五克蘭姆的量，自然可收效騐，因此歐洲各國學者，現今都以煤油，成爲治肺病無上的神藥云</p>

<h3 id="c190">鸚鵡洲與鸚鵡 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 古明</p>
<p>早些日子報載漢口鸚鵡洲大火，燒去茅棚五百餘間。這消息和住在上海洋房中人，毫無關係的，不過很使人想起些故實。||　考鸚鵡洲之所以得名，倒不在於牠（芳草萋萋），而是那兒曾殺掉了一位名士||　正平。看過三國志演義的人，一定知道這位先生曾經打着鼓，駡過曹孟德。那是不可信的。不過曹操很恨他，想殺他了，而怕弄壞了自已的名聲，送劉表，劉也恨極了，大概是他太驕傲吧，又怕蒙惡名，（以江夏太守黃祖（性急），故送衡與之。）後來果然（性急）的當了傻子，將他殺掉。死時年二十六。</p>
<p>他們爲什麽這麽客氣的呢？大概因爲那時朝野都很愛惜有文才的靑年。可惜者是他是一個（寗順從以遠害，不違忤以喪生）的人，如一隻鸚鵡。而不知一入籠檻，就（未有開籠日）了。</p>
<p>不但禰衡如此，古今文土像鸚鵡的很多。也說人話，也學唱歌，也許還懂到點（駡人的藝術），然而（不離飛鳥），（綠衣翠衿）也不見得時常討人喜歡，紅樓</p>
<p>夢裏的鸚鵡就給丫頭們痛恨。當然，不過一隻鳥兒而已。但有些鸚鵡也許愛自由，從前就有過這樣的故事||</p>
<p>某人養了一隻鸚鵡，某天遇了一個和尚，鸚鵡就問他如何能出籠呢？那和尚很很地說：（若問出籠之日，除非兩脚筆直！）鸚鵡聽了猛可一氣，便氣死了。那主人很傷悼，深怪和尚多事，便將牠取出埋葬起來，等到一開籠子，牠飛去了。</p>
<h3 id="c191">想到漂泊 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>雖是很久以前的事了，但如今一想起，還令我悠然神往的。</p>
<p>響着拍達拍達的棕木拖鞋，趁着細雨，瀰濛的秋天早上，便登上伊拉瓦底江的南下輪船，離開八募了。望見兩岸烟雨中亭亭立着的柳樹，逐漸後退，朦朧起來，而至消失在霧裏時，旅行和漂泊的</p>
<p>愉快，便鮮明地，强烈地，浮在我的心中。就是到現在，也還以爲那一次的登上旅途，是平生中最難有的快事。</p>
<p>因爲先前在春天，我曾想憑着這條南國的江流，到更遠的地方去，但却爲生活所迫，竟至連八募也難住下，終於逼回北面的野人山中，去過掃馬糞的辛苦日子，一直度了整整的五個月頭。</p>
<p>此刻想着，假使没有這樣的經過，則在江上，憑着船欄，眺望異國雨景的興致，一定是没有那麽强旺，那麽濃重的。因此，我可以說，窮困的漂泊，比富裕的旅行，就更令人感到興味而且特别神往些。但這須要有着長期苦悶心情的人，才能領略這種意味的，｜倘若他並没有實際漂泊過的話。</p>
<p>善寫知識份子苦悶的契可甫，我想，他的心情，也一定是極端苦悶的吧？去年得諾貝爾獎金的蒲寧，就曾經記叙過喫可甫臨死以前，常常高聲說着的夢話：（變成一個流浪者，一個香客，到那些聖地去，住在寺裏，林中，湖畔；夏天的晚上，坐在回敎禮拜堂前的櫈上····）。這是怎樣地憧憬着漂泊呵｜</p>
<p>我自已，由四川到缅甸，就全用赤足，走那些難行的雲南的山道，而且，在昆明，在仰光，都曾有過繳不出店錢而被趕到街頭的苦况的，在理是，不管心情方面，或是身體方面，均應該倦於流浪了。但如今一提到漂泊，却仍舊心神響往，覺得那是人生最消魂的事呵。爲什麽呢？不知道。這也許是沉重的苦悶，還深深地壓入在我的心頭的原故吧？然而一想到這種個人式的享樂，是應該放棄的時候，那遠處佳麗的湖山，未知名的草原，就只好一讓牠閒躺在天末了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">隆重的事 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 魏猛克</p>
<p>雪飛着，天氣好冷。</p>
<p>這禮堂雖然小，打通了一個敎室，也居然擺得下三百張講桌。桌子上用鉛筆歪斜地畫着的女同學的臉兒同腿兒，竟破格的被校工提來幾桶水，洗掉了。桌的左角，還有秩序的粘貼着號碼。平常敎室裏是不設火爐的，今天却不但設了，而且多至三個。一關上窗門，熱氣就烘烘逼人，卸了大衣，也還覺得一身發脹。要不是窗外的雪飛着，我們大約會疑心陽春到了。學校當局對於考試塲的設備做到了這地步，雖不說怎麽冠冕堂皇，在我們心中，也總以爲大可過得去</p>
<p>的；何况講臺後的粉白牆上，還新添了什麽旗幟和玉照呢｜</p>
<p>鐘還未響，同學們就爭先恐後的跑來了，這樣熱心於考試的學生，以上海的大學堂而論罷，也總算是不多的。我們的態度委實安閒，鎭靜，大家緊緊的將這三個火爐子包圍起來：談天，說笑，相駡，甚而至於打架。總之，考試，在我們的心中，那眞是太有把握了。</p>
<p>是的，考試眞有把握。鐘響了，我們依秩序的（歸了號子），打開墨盒來，蘸好筆；各人從衣袋裏摸出一個星期以前的稿子；依然談笑着，泰然的等那油印好了的題目和卷子發下來，就動手工作。</p>
<p>監試員｜｜敎務主任劉鬍子特别加上了一件靑緞馬褂，抱了一捆卷子，摸着八字鬚，沉重的走進來了。在室門邊不聲不響的站了兩三分鐘，研究一審各式各樣的臉，然後踱過去，小心地按號發下題目和卷子，板起面孔嚴厲說：（用心些做，卷子是不准掉換的。）</p>
<p>考試於是開始，空氣緊張起來，劉鬍子不聲不響的往來踱着沉重的方步；發現了那一面有了笑聲，就趕過去，瞪着眼睛下警告道：（唔···）。　考塲的玻璃窗上忽然貼上了幾張面孔，發出吃吃的笑聲。這很使劉鬍子忿怒，趕緊叱咤道：（呔！看甚麽？）但這不但無效，而且面孔漸漸增多起來，笑聲也更加熱閙了。劉鬍子雖然十分莊嚴，對了這些面孔也終於無法可想，只好一你呌什麽名字？）（你是那一系的學生？）的亂發質問。</p>
<p>劉鬍子發怒是難怪的，現在的期考成了最隆重的事，那裏能容别系的同學破壞！在往日，怎樣胡閙都由他去，現在學校剛立案，給部裏知道了，那可不好玩的呀。我們都同情劉鬍子，在緊張的空氣裏，我們更可以振作精神來趕快考完，回到火爐邊談心去。現在給他們一吵，心緒可亂了，要不是我們的文章都預備得不長，恐怕連抄也幾乎抄不下去呢！　考試不到半個鐘頭就完結。劉鬍子小心地按號收去卷子，摸着八字鬚，沉重的踱着方步走出門去。我們又將這三個火爐子包圍起來，外面閒着的同學們，也張着凍殭了的，桃紅色的面孔擠進來</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>雪飛着，天氣好冷。</p>

<p>梁任公體的文章也曾在湖南發生了大影響。當日時務報的文章，那個不歡喜讀？便是舊派，亦無異詞。但因梁任公到湖南講學，湖南新派人物，也刊行了湘學報，湘報，這就遭了湖南舊派的大</p>

<p>原來葉先生是攻擊新派的舊派領袖，攻擊了康梁一派的思想還不够，還要攻擊康梁一派的文章。他致皮先生書中說：　時文久爲通人所詬病，通人多不能時文，高才博學坐是困於塲屋，而揣摩之士乃捷足得之。然易之以策論，其弊等耳。不見今日之試卷，滿紙只有起點壓力熱力等字乎？同一空談，何不顧溺人之笑！</p>
<p>他攻擊新文體的策論徒用新名詞，也是空談，和八股文一樣。他又與友人書說：最可笑者，筆舌掉罄，自稱支那；初哉首基，必曰起點。不思支那乃釋氏</p>
<p>之稱唐土，起點乃舌人之解算文，論其語，則繙譯而成詞；按其文，則拚音而得字。非文非質，不中不西。東施效顰，各毋爲鄰女竊笑耶？</p>
<p>這也是攻擊使用新名詞的文章。又湘省學約中辨文體一條說：</p>
<p>朝廷以時文積弊太深，改試策論。然試塲策論非有學術，能文章者主持之，其弊殆比時文更甚。觀湘報所刻諸作，如熱力，漲力，愛力，吸力，攝力，壓力，支那，震旦，起點，成線，血輪，腦筋，靈魂，以太，黃種，白種。四萬萬人等字眼，搖筆卽來。或者好爲一切幽渺怪僻之言，閲不終篇，令人氣逆。　可見三十多年前新派文人用新名詞入文章，那是舊派文人最爲痛恨的事。當時這種新文體流行湖南，可以說是梁任公帶來的。徐學使居然用這種文章取士，難怪湖南一批由八股文出身的舊派文人又　妬又憤慨了。</p>
<p>梁任公曾經說他自已的文章，（筆端常帶情感），那是不錯的。他是一個政論家，他的政論所以能够風行天下，筆</p>
<p>端情感也是其中要素之一。他這種適於煽動的文章帶到湖南，有一個貢生學得極像，這人呌做樊錐，邵陽人。在湘報上發表了一些文章。最被舊派攻擊的一篇，題爲（開誠），其中說道：</p>
<p>自民之愚也久矣，不復見天日也亦已甚矣。其上以是愚之，其下復以是受之。二千年淪肌浸髓，梏夢桎魂，酣嬉怡悅於苦海地獄之中，縱橫馳逐於醉生魘死之地，束之縛之，踐之踏之，若牛馬</p>
<p>然，若莓苔然。</p>
<p>這是痛駡兩千多年來的愚民政策，思想頗有點不穏了。又說：　今宜上自百寮，下至羣醜，俱如此類，網羅凈盡，聚之一室，幽而閉之，使</p>
<p>其不見日月，不與覆載。</p>
<p>如此對付貪汚腐敗的官僚，何等澈底！他的議論更激烈了。又說：　是故願吾皇操五寸之管，半池之墨，不問於人，不謀於衆，下一紙詔書，斷斷必行。曰，今事已至此，危迫日極，雖有目前，一無所用。與其肢剖節解，</p>
<p>寸寸與人，稅駕何所，躡天無路，不如趁其未爛，公之天下。朕其已矣！</p>
<p>他這種主張，眞是大膽。難怪舊派的人駁他道：（天子詔命。豈臣下所敢戲擬，况此等大逆無道之言乎！國典具在，臠割寸磔，處以極刑，似尚未足以蔽其辜。）他在文中又說：</p>
<p>洗舊習，從公道，則一切繁禮細故，猥尊鄙貴，文武名塲惡例劣範，銓選檔册謬條亂章，大政鴻法，普憲均律，四民學校，風情土俗，一革從前，搜索無剩，唯泰西者是效，用孔子紀年。</p>
<p>這種澈底的變法維新，當時怎麽能够做得到？他却不能不如此主張。他是湖南的走極端的新派。他比梁任公的主張更澈底，他比梁任公的議論更激烈，他充分表現了湖南人走極端的特性。然而他是受梁任公影響最深的人。</p>
<p>說起來眞可笑。（戊戍）前後，梁任公太新；（辛亥）前後，梁任公又舊了；（五四）前後，梁任公（跟著後生跑），還赶不上；這一個偉大的時代眞有點捉弄人。雖然，時代是一直向前的，人不站在時代之前，就落在時代之後，這又有什麽稀奇呢！</p>

<p>（他突然哭了起來。）她感到慚愧的低下頭去。</p>
<p>（孩子哭了，仍聽不到你作聲，你是睡着的吧？）</p>
<p>（不，太太，我是醒的。）（爲什麽不哼哼他睡去呢，這小孩子也有脾氣，他哭了你哼一陣。便會不哭的。）太太說。想了想又問：（你會哼小曲嗎？）</p>
<p>（不會的。）（這樣，（哼哼，小寳貝，睡着吧，哼哼···）也不會嗎？眞是鄕下人，孩子哭了，也不作聲的···）</p>
<p>以後，寂靜的晚上，當孩子哭着時，就可聽到奶媽用粗大的喉聲哼着：（哼哼，小寳貝，）</p>
<p>睡着吧，哼哼···）</p>
<p>（五）奶媽到她家里一個月還缺四天，剛是孩子生到這世界上一百天。她們凖備爲孩子宴客。太太先二天對奶媽說：（後天孩子百日了，預備請酒，有許多親戚朋友要來，替孩子剃剃頭！）面孔淸　的瘦弱的孩子到奶媽身邊只有二十多天，吃了她的奶，正像菜園的小菜，得了細雨般的肥了。孩子非常活潑可愛，黑眼珠，鼻子高高的鯽魚背似的。那天，孩子剃了頭，穿上和初夏顔色相調和的藍格子新衣。銀的頸鍊掛着一串銀鈴，稍稍一動，就（令令）的響起來。</p>
<p>住在城中的姑母，小姨，太太舊日的同學，一些女客們都到齊了，她們每個人到了。没有坐下椅子，便十分懷念似的詢問；（公子呢？）奶媽抱着孩子躱在房里，她好像怕見客人。今天孩子打扮起來，奶媽自已也打扮起來了，臉上擦了粉，又呌女厨子替她修了臉，穿了那套白竹布短衫褲。她被太太從房里喚到坐滿客人的客廳里，抱着孩子給客人看，她們輪流着讚美孩子：（孩子多可愛，鼻子高高的像他父親。）就有人接上來說：（一雙黑眼珠正像他母親哩！）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致呈俏利之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四角左右、坎拿大漲四五分、故開價後、各月份市氣、異常堅定、一月至三月份、并以市塲浮多、漸趨活躍、投機者多故意抬起、較之前週、好起不少、迨至下午開至四盤、市氣仍然激昂、本月份最高抬至二元二角、三四月份亦高至二元一角九分半、旋以廠家忽出而抛售、致人心隨之回落一二分不等、惟遠期因交易甚淡、仍然站住、結果本月份不動、三月份反跌七厘半、四月份跌一分、五月份跌五厘、六月份好五厘、七月份好一分半、現麥由福新去磘灣麥四元一角、江西麥三元八角六分、共七百七十六包、又阜豐去政府美麥二船、華豐去一千噸、價均四元二角半、</p>

<p>｜統市祗開一百五十包｜</p>
<p>昨日客秈因已近陰歷年底、各方均求結束、到銷兩少、存底略有、行販均欲守至明春紅盤再賣、目下擯不售出、去路則福州雖止、泉州尚貪、因浮存已枯、未能暢辦、統市只有泉州辦去江北機秈一百五十包、價至七元、比前市較大一角、其他均無交易、惟市上洋米存底尚豐、昨有間浙帮問訊、大約在陰歷年内當有若干直接配裝也、</p>

<p>雜糧油餅同業、因近廢曆年關、大多在結束之中、故雜糧公會曁采菽堂之市集、交易寥落、計雜糧總成交次花生百餘包、小麥七百餘包、黃荳五車八百包、内中尚有行家作進之貨、油類計夾倉生油六百件、輪連歧荳油五十件、刻下各種市况、勢無變遷矣、</p>

<p>白桐油素以漢市爲重心、上月出口數量似較</p>
<p>前月爲稀、大概總計約千噸稍零、市面漲跌廖定、一月份統計最高祇二十五元、最低爲二十二元七角、上落相差僅二元三角、平均在二十三元六角之間、因洋行辦數無大宗、故漲跌尚微、月杪時因美商洋行稍有採辦、售價爲二十三元二角、旋漢行又欲加價、似須二十三元六七角、始肯出售、洋行勢所不願、致未關出、迨至本月初仍祇二十三元二角、略有交易、所以本埠先傳漢市報好者、僅有空盤、並無確實交易做開、現在市面如　、且因　結　期巴迪、市情恐無變動矣、聞漢市行家開進　桐爲十九元稍　、文籌連稅祇十八元六七角、後市或稍加價、亦未可知、大概因售者不多所致、本埠號家正團結束、近日交易甚少、浙桐漸廉、先幾日杭市曾做過第砠十九元一二角江交云、</p>

<h3 id="c232">一個嚴重的問題 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>這决不是一個平凡的消息；而是一個大上海前途底嚴重問題！　　吾昨天翻開某晚報來，就看到一個特號字標題的驚人消息，據載；（本市市塲衰落商業不振，最近爲債務被控；向法院聲請執行封門者，有大小商店五百餘家之多，南京路也有不少。現當局正在考慮中，因一旦貿然執行則將影響全滬市面甚巨，···云）。前天吾因事去訪本埠商業巨子王羣，同時談起目前的上海商業情形。他說：（本市自從一二八發生以後，市塲日見蕭條，房租的增高，使一般的商人實有不勝負擔之苦。加之農村經濟的破産，各國也都在閙着不景氣，金融奇窘，購買力减低。本來在這風雨飄搖的年頭兒，要想維持現狀，已是一椿不很容易的事情了，還那裏談得到發展！雖然；在側面看來。最近的上海似乎儘在繁榮，十幾層的華麗大厦，偉大的電影院，大飯店，跳舞廳，銀行，蓬蓬勃勃，像雨後春笋一般地崛起。但是要在側面去觀察，則吾相信這些都是畸形的發展，决不能認爲好現象的，他正象徵着上海前途的危機，據吾精確的推想；預料本市在廢歷年終倒閉的商家當不在少數···）吾想，上面這二個消息如果是事實的話，那末上海不是眞要（坍）了嗎？但，依吾的感想，這些也不是毫無根據的話，他實在是一個嚴重的問題！可是，造成這問題的局阻者，當不外下面的六種原因。</p>
<p>（受一二八的賜予）上海自從一二八日軍在閘北暴行以後，全滬市面燬於砲火洗禮的過半，租界上雖然勉强保持了常態（？）但是，從此市塲一蹶不振，金融週轉不靈。那些大資産家，亦已焦頭爛額，小資本者多數無力維持，相繼没落。勉强能够苟延殘喘的，僅有少數了。　　（世界經濟的不景氣）世界過濟不景氣的浪潮打入了中國，商界首當其衝，直按間接都受了他極大的影響。因爲吾國幾年以來；外侮未已，内亂頻仍，又受了天災人禍的毒害，列强侵略的排擠，和那苛捐雜稅的剥削。本來就已千瘡萬孔元氣大喪，何能再受這不景氣的壓迫！</p>
<p>（農村經濟的破産）吾國歷來就被世界各國公認爲以農立國的，是以農村已成爲吾國的命脈，尤其是商界的生命泉源。一旦農村破産，則全國商業市場，也將隨之而崩潰。這是無疑的，近年來的吾國農村；水災旱荒，兵燹匪禍，不絕地相襲，農産出品也不堪低落。農人們視爲大宗收入的絲茶，又一落千丈，村無富户，道有餓殍，他的遠因近果亦不是一朝一夕的。其關係商業又是怎麽的大啊！</p>
<p>（購買力的不振）因了農村的破産，經濟的週轉不靈。是購買力亦日見减低，使各商界營業上受了一個巨大的打擊。商人原是全靠人們的購買，以維持其生命的，而今購買力的减低；實不啻壟斷了他們生命的源流。</p>
<p>（無謂的競爭）因爲營業的不振，而彼此减價競爭，以冀招徠主顧，增强其購買力。因此；在街頭巷尾無論在一家大小商店的門前，都常年懸起那大减價大贈品的旗幟。一種裝飾的消費，統計起來一定有驚人的數目。但是這種辦法；原不過像一個將要垂死的人，去打一針强心針一樣，以苟延這片刻的生命而已，於根本上還不是一樣地没有辦法？</p>
<p>（房租的不勝負擔）目前上海的地産價格只儘量地提高，那些大房東爲要保持他自已的利益起見，遂不得不在房客身上出産！於是把房金來拚命地增加上去，也顧不得房客們的力量，這肩頭上壓得起這些，壓不起這些，只管重重地壓榨着。一般商家在一個月的營業上收入，還不够付一個月的房金。所以無形中就得負債倒閉。那些往年賺了錢的，還可以掙扎一下。要是新開的或没有基礎的是休想立足！</p>
<p>吾在以上六種原因裏推測下來；在那五百多家商店的被控，也的確是不得已的情形，他們也實在有說不出的痛苦。假使當局根據原告的要求而貿然加以執行；則上海全市受其影響將不堪設想。若當局爲顧全市面而不加以執行的，那麽將來此風一開，也要引起極大的反感！吾不知當局接受了這椿進退兩難的案子，將如何使其圓滿解决？</p>
<p>幾天來的减租運動聲浪，已播遍了全市。這是一個樂得聽的好消息；不知將來的結果怎樣？吾們當靜待這好消息的來臨吧！</p>
<h3 id="c233">垃圾堆邊 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>一堆，兩堆···壘壘的灰色垃圾積滿了這荒野的廣場，零亂錯列，遠遠望去，恰如一處義塚裏叢葬着的墳墓。</p>
<p>淸輝的朝陽漸漸地照入了廣場，垃圾堆裏冒着一絲一絲的熱氣，發出奇臭酸霉的味道。</p>
<p>（嗚）！半嚮。偶爾一輛黃色的垃圾車馳來了，彌天的塵霧烏雲似的飛揚起來，孩子都高抬一隻手臂遮住着自已的眼睛。</p>
<p>這裏的孩子們特别多，而且都是穿得那樣的襤樓和骯髒，雖然是嚴寒的冬天，有的還赤着一雙小脚，天眞的，活潑的在跳躍着，從那油黑的小臉和破爛的衣裳上，一望而知其爲窮人們的孩子。　　他們同樣地都有父母和家庭，爲了（窮）却無資格和小（寳貝），哥兒們一樣地去享受（現在的敎育），每天，從大淸</p>
<p>早到黃昏，整天地只沉醉在這唯一的（公園）||荒野的廣場之中，將黃金的童年光陰葬送到垃圾堆裏。</p>
<p>從那龐大的垃圾堆所發出的奇臭在引誘他們，這兒是唯一的舊劇舞臺，天然的戰場，以及迷人的賭博廠。在這兒經常地有（皇帝），（大王），（武松），（張飛）之類的偉人的足跡，時常會爆發着大規模有組織的激戰。打彈子。打牌，爲了幾個銅板小小的賭博甚至使人忘記回家吃飯。這兒也有奸詐，陰險，欺騙和强權。這是動的小世界，窮困的孩了們的自由聚散所。</p>
<p>三四個孩子圍着左角上一堆新垃圾，每人拿着一根竹片或短棒在拕抓着，</p>
<p>仔細地，注神地尋找着其中被别人抛棄了的尚能稍微値錢的廢物||破鐵，爛布，空罐頭之類，藉以輔助窮困的家庭</p>
<p>些許收入。</p>
<p>（噢）！正在拕抓得出神的十歲的小狗子突然着跳了起來。（什麽）？旁邊小七子和招弟都給這不平常的喊聲怔往了，齊聲地問。（抄票）！小狗子說着，從緊握着的一隻手的指縫中露出抄票的花紋。（看看）！小七子的左手伸得長長地。（不成！是我拾的呀）！小狗子搖搖頭退了兩步。（看看都不成嗎）？小七子說時向旁邊的招弟瞟了一眼，前進兩步，胸脯挺</p>
<p>得直直地，右手緊緊握着那根用來拕抓垃圾的破凳脚，儼如一個拿着指揮刀的帝國主義的軍官。形勢將要動武。</p>
<p>一看了不要緊呀！橫直誰也不要了你的）。招弟畢竟是個女孩子，口吻來得油滑些。</p>
<p>小狗子可費躊躇了！他想想如果祇招弟一個那是不怕的，對付一個女孩子只要一手抓住那條黃而且短的小辫子，一切問題都好解决，小七子可就辣手了，不說併起來比自已要高上一個頭，那條又粗又硬的凳脚挨在腰上至少有點難受，何况小七子剛才曾向招弟擠眉弄眼地，凖定是在談判什麽秘密外交，預備搶去了自已的鈔票二一添作五。在這種嚴重的形勢之下，與其丢了鈔票還要肉體受苦的去抵抗，倒不如恭恭敬敬雙手獻出來，萬一小七子和招弟偶爾發現一</p>
<p>點什麽（人道）或（良心）之類，說不定還有幾分之幾的慰勞的希望。</p>
<p>（看是可以的，可是誰也不許搶）。小狗子畢竟聰敏，最後决計採取着不抵抗主義政策，但他的口吻却絕對掩飾着自已的軟弱。</p>
<p>小狗子將持着鈔票的手鬆開，六隻眼睛餓狼似的注視着那張鈔票。</p>
<p>（假鈔票，燒給（赤老）用的！哈！）小七子招弟一個發現那是一張五塊頭的</p>
<p>假鈔票，不但花紋非常糢糊，鈔票的一角還燒黑了一小塊。（哈！快點拿回去給你媽用吧！）招弟刻毒地譏訕着。</p>
<p>一切都毁滅了！小七子的蔑笑和招弟的饑訕，使小狗子感到莫大的侮辱，這侮辱比駡她的媽或祖宗十三代還要來得狠惡。是永遠不能昭雪的奇恥。　　小狗子的眼淚不自覺地流到了腮邊，他並不知自已是悲哀還是激憤！他兇惡地將那張鈔票撕成了兩半邊抛擲在地上，低着頭哭喪着臉悄悄的離開了廣場，最後，只輕輕地聽到他說了一聲（誰也没說是眞的呀）！</p>
<h3 id="c234">人類的聰明 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>（人爲萬物之靈）。是的，人類確實是宇宙間最聰明的動物。不過在這（聰明的動物）中間，自然也有智愚之分，至少，像我就是這羣（聰明的動物）中間最愚笨的一個了，我想。</p>
<p>有一次，我爲了某椿事情從西區到東面去，我於是搭電車，電車擠得非常的厲害：坐位上固然没有了空，就是站在座位中間的，也湧得前俯後仰，個個人都是面紅耳赤，死力掙扎着。我站在電車門的旁邊，一手揑着銅子，一手托在車門上，以支撑我的身子。車將到某站，一個服裝很時髦的年靑人斗的從人叢中擠了出來，面部那麽莊嚴地，想是很憤恨我這隻托在門上的手吧，他使勁地將我的手摔去，把門劃然移開，我的手就落在門縫的中間托着，他出去後隨卽把門用力帶上，這一來可把我的手指軋進去了，我痛極欲哭，本能地縮回了手，檢視着进流的鮮血，這時候那靑年還站在月臺上，隔着玻璃猙獰地望着我，口中念念有詞：</p>
<p>（該死的！不識相的！）</p>
<p>我把創傷的手指用拭巾包裏着，我忍受着二重的苦痛，過了一會，賣票的才將我早已數好了銅子來接了過去，往錢袋裏一摔：（對不住，等一會兒），顧自往後面去了。</p>
<p>車子到了某站，又是一個年靑人從一個彪形大漢的旁邊坐位上站了起來，怱忙中把那個大漢橫伸的脚踏上一脚，只見那大漢二眼圓睜，發着瞭亮的聲音：（你可有眼睛的？媽的！）</p>
<p>那年靑的人一壁連說（對不起），一壁俯下身去替他拂脚，大漢這才哼了一聲一晤），年靑的人就狼狽地下車去了。</p>
<p>車子就要到我目的地了，而車票終是没有到手，我替（賣票）担心着，担心着（查票）會就要來到。我幾次想問他要票了，但終於囁嚅地没有出口，後來，我担心得忍耐不住了，乘機拉了拉（賣票；）輕輕地問：</p>
<p>（票子可以給我了麽？喂。）（不要緊，曉得！）（賣票）一壁微笑。一壁伸首窗外望了一望。便又走到後面去了。</p>
<p>（查票）終於來了，我眞替（賣票）担着心，因爲我覺得這是他的責任。</p>
<p>查票的向我要票，我便惴惴地指着賣票的，（查票）便喊了起來：（ＸＸＸ號，票子呢！）（什麽？他幾曾買了票？）帽子朝後高覆着嘴角掛滿了唾沫的（賣票）惡很很地說。</p>
<p>（唔，我是買過的。）我自已也不知怎的，臉孔覺得有些發燒了，話也講大不出來。</p>
<p>（幾分？快買！我親眼見你剛上來的！）（賣票）來勢洶洶地說。（幾個銅子不打緊，不過我是實在買過的，現在我就再買一張也罷，）我拿了角子給查票員，呌他找，我想（賣票）的心裏總該明白的。</p>
<p>（哼！誰揩你的油？）賣票的依舊咕嚕着。　　在這時，我默然下了車，還聽見（查票）和開車的在駡着：</p>
<p>（屈死！趁不起車不要趁１）</p>
<p>我站立在街頭，撫着指頭的疼痛，我惘然了。　　以後，我想發願不敢再趁電車了，但是朋友Ｔ君對我說：（賓，這你未免太傻了！你是不是還想在這世界上活下去的？你放大了眼光看看整個的世界吧。那一件事惟不是這樣的？你要避免它，你只有不活下去！）</p>
<p>於是我恍然，現在我知道“這是人類應有的聰明。　　我以後也想學得聰明一些，因爲我還要活下去。</p>

<p>— 飛士</p>
<p>記得（現代）上曾經印載過郁達夫先生一副自寫聯，文曰：（避席畏聞文字獄。著書都爲稻梁謀。）大約錄的是龔定　的句子吧。　　郁達夫先生，是一位有名的文人。</p>
<p>就其出身來說，亦可以算是一個世家。自然自身此處的地位是並不在萬民之下的，而且。達夫先生自始至終都是一位道地的文人，旣無（取而代之）的野心，亦無（揭竿而起）的反志。依情理。是應該得着享受他那恬靜的生活。然而，竟有了這樣的感想。至於一般站在達夫先生以下的人，其所感受的程度是更不待說的了。從這兒，我們可以測量出我們這國土裏的氣候。</p>
<p>現在又到舊歷的過年時期了。雖然政府早有明令廢除，但就在上海這文明集中的地方，一般的人民依然要在這個時期在門上貼貼紅對，放放爆竹，表示迎新送舊。爆竹到是一致的，最大的一致就是它那爆竹的聲音。紅對却各色各樣了，尤其是一般所謂書香之家的門上貼的變化最大，而且。有許多還是隨着那時的國事和政情的變化而變化的，但不知道還有像這樣的書香之家没有？如果還有的話，那就請貼達夫先生所錄的這一副吧。</p>
<p>文人大致是只會發發牢騷的，所以俗語說得好：（秀才造反，三年不成。）然而，能够發發牢騷的文人，到底還是比較有出息的，過去的許多文人。因爲苦於英雄無用武之地，結果也就不免將一部分牢騷發在對聯上面，不過，現在就連這點也不容易見着了。</p>
<p>小孩子的時候，只覺得紅紙寫着黑字貼在門上是比那原有的一塊黑門框好看得多，而且也很歡喜，因爲那是告訴我要穿新衣服和吃好飲食了。進了學校以後，才知道那有許多意思。然而大體却没有什麽變化，不是！（天增歲月人增壽春滿乾坤福滿門），便是｜（春花春酒春富貴福祿福壽福禎祥），差不多每年都是這些話。</p>
<p>今年呢，眼看一二八的二週年一過，有許多的血迹還迷糊在心上的時候，舊歷年就到來了。我不妨送上一副對聯給大家祝賀這個應該快快樂樂的（太平年（文曰：（國事那堪談休談國事家常多可嘆且嘆家常）</p>

<p>— 麥夫</p>
<p>通常跑到人家那裏去借錢，總是要說不說的說着一半，其餘的一半總是讓給那對方的人去想了出來，說着一半而留一半讓人家去想，這其間當然是要運用所謂表現技術的，因爲祇一個骨片雖然也可以看出那野獸的全身來，但是那到底需要專門的學問，然而世人爲着便於人家借貸而備下這種專門的學問是少有的，於是這裏便生出了所謂人世間的誤會。</p>
<p>本來不運用着技術固然是不妙的，但是技術運用得過當了，人家也可以含混起來。因爲說一半固然不致於失掉身分，讓人家看不起。然而爲的是自已掏腰房剜良心肉，卽管是裝痴裝呆要能够含混得過去，怕也是自已所希冀的吧，　　因爲各有各的原因，而這各有各的原因又是慣常的出現着，於是借錢的不管留給人家去想的那一半是留着太多了，或是恰得其當，若是一没有結果，終竟便總是以爲人家是故意的含混起來；</p>
<p>而對方呢，却也總是不管是聽到了那弦外之音，或是實在不明白出息，却一概輕飄飄地撇了開來，樂着自已不遭橫刦　　該會總容易拖帶着憤恨，憤恨起了，便總想報復着對方。於是而所謂綁匪之中怕也不少這樣的借錢君子吧。</p>

<p>（四）婚禮進行曲　　春天，日子像飛一般的快。但克佳和靜宜恨着長夜漫漫的時候，春風算來</p>
<p>還是很快的送走了三天。在這第三天的早上，讀者應該來參加這婚禮的。　　跑馬廳旁的一家大飯店門前，五色的彩布在三月的春風中飄蕩，穿白制服的侍着，梭一般的來往，我們從甬道中向前走，可以瞧見效蓀掛着神經質的笑</p>
<p>容向每個賓客握手，點頭。在女賓叢中自然少不了靜文的。</p>
<p>結婚儀式是最新式的，客廳正中放着一隻罩白布的長檯，一張結婚證書，停會新郎新娘坐汽車來的時候，就在這裏舉行點綴人生的（把戲）</p>
<p>門外走來一對不相稱的賓客，男的雖裝飾得那樣漂亮，但在年齡上至少使人覺感，這對夫婦有不調和的遺憾，我現在介紹給讀者女的就是勤菠，那男子不必說是她的丈夫了。她進來似乎就特别注意到效蓀跳過來拍着他的肩頭說：（效孫，難得從杭州趕回來。）效蓀正身朝里和一位朋友談話，受驚的回過頭來，見是勤菠，似乎他不預</p>
<p>料她來似的呆住了，然而忙自然地和她握手。（多久不見了，勤菠，難得這般早來。）神經質地笑着。（没有見過吧？）她見丈夫站在身旁（朱效蓀先生！李少芹）他們握着手，點頭代表了寒喧。靜文聽見了勤菠的聲音，也跑過來招呼（我代妹妹謝謝。）（頑皮孩子，我前幾天問靜宜說你還没有到上海來。）（請不到代課，我眞不願意幹這種事了。）效蓀站在旁側搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮，靜文像突然記起了似的說：（我媽</p>
<p>要見見你哩！）她放了勤菠的手（我不招待你了。）效蓀和李少芹點點頭，他們兩個拉着手到臨時的新房裏去。靜文的母親是個慈祥的中年婦人，見兩人笑着進來，站起來問：（是朱先生？）（是的，小弟弟｜｜我的母親。）（伯母。）（朱先生不要見笑，這般大年紀還像個孩子。）一個無邪地笑着，一個搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮。（眞謝謝朱先生特别從杭州來帮忙。）</p>
<p>（應該來道喜。伯母。）（聽說朱先生在杭州養病，現在身體好了？）（多謝伯母，現在好了。）</p>
<p>（那過了克佳的喜事不再回杭州去了？）靜文的母親像有什麽希圖似的拉長着聲調，同時瞧着她女兒。（那說不定｜大概不去了。）（克佳說他新屋空房太多，又不願貼召租，我已答應和靜文搬過去住，朱先生如能住在上海，那我們更熱閙了。）</p>
<p>（那自然很好，差不多都是自已人！唔，比較是很知已的朋友。）（朱先生娶了夫人更熱閙了。）老太太似乎打趣地說。效蓀神經質地低下頭去，搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮。外面軍樂的聲音響了起來，老太太對靜文說：（他們來了！）</p>

<p>＝善於謊言自已亦說不可靠＝　　＝行爲怪癖一肚子的壞主意＝　　這位被人稱爲美國嘉賓的凱絲玲海嬪（ＫａｔｈａｒｉｎｅＨｅｐｂｕｒｎ），很不幸的因爲她面貌有些像那位瑞典明星，以致被人家稱爲嘉寳的替身。其實她有她的特别的個性，她有她的藝術的特長，並不是靠面貌像一位外國的明星而成名的。現在一般女明星們，都趨著學時髦，没有發展個人特性的勇氣，所以特爲拿這位凱絲玲海嬪的種種特異之點，提了出來，或者於中國的一般女明星有些相當的益處。當然，凱絲玲亦有種種怪癖，是不足爲訓的，但那不亦是一個女伶在她的蛻化之中，所難以避免的變態嗎？　　這位凱絲玲海嬪，亦可以當得起怪明星之稱了。她到了好萊塢這許多時候，她的過去的生活，以及家世的情形，至今還没有被人家戮穿。她今天告訴人家的，明天就否認了。頂有趣的是她自已說她生過兩個孩子；她的丈夫呌做ＬｕｄｌｏｗＳｍｉｔｈ。不過現在她又好似不承認了。有一天她對一位新聞記者說，（好，你儘管公佈這個消息好了。是的，我是有小孩子的，我有兩個。眞有意思極了。當然，他們都是漆黑的臉··這個你亦應當替我公佈的。）你想這種話，够多末幽默，但是比方遇見了一位直肚腸的人相信了，豈不要閙成大笑話嗎？　　凱絲玲未到好萊塢之前，她已經將好萊塢的一切，細細考察了一下。她知道好萊塢那時所急需的，就是怪異與新奇。於是她的肚子裏，就帶了一大包的怪異與新奇，來到好萊塢。她初到的時候，外面已經放足了空氣，說她是個富家閨秀，她自已的家私有幾百萬等等。這樣她的名氣，就轟動了全美國。她在好菜塢，還有種種怪癖的行爲，如同好穿工人的連衣袴（Ｏｖａｒａｌｌｓ），上面還特别呌有名的裁衣師，替他加了幾個補綻，她常常在馬路當中，讀着影迷們寄給她的信。她還喜歡和她所豢養的一隻猴子講話。她常常除了上衣之外，祇穿一條很小很小的短袴。她這樣怪形怪狀，却自已恬不爲怪。</p>
<p>人家說她很天眞，可是她亦天眞過份了。她常常一鼻子的雀斑，但是過了幾天雀斑又看不見了。原來她的雀斑並不甚顯，不過有的時候，她拿畫眉毛的筆故意加深些，就使得雀斑更顯了。這不是天眞過頭了嗎？有一天她忽然發起奇興，要打高爾夫球。從來没有人看見過她的球藝，可是她一打就很好。她竟敢和一位高爾夫的女專家愛琳童挑戰。這亦是使人覺得很奇怪的。總之，她好像是個變戲法的魔術家，但是她帽子裏藏的是兎子還是鷄，却没有人能猜得透。就是她自已，她亦承認自已是個不可靠的謊言者。但她却能扮什麽像什麽，行行出色，件件都能。這不都是一個全能女伶所必須俱備的本領嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c240">（人生）的觀感 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 綠意</p>
<p>（人生），這是一部作風新頴，含有深刻的刺激和敎育意味的作品。　　阮玲玉和林楚楚是兩種女件的模型，同時也可以說是兩個母親的模型。阮玲玉的一生，（在人生的供爐裏，一個脆弱的靈魂，鍜練着，鍜練着，）受盡了挫折和磨難，她誠然明白非人生活的不甘，但她在黑暗的人生旅途裏摸不着一條光明的正路，終於糊糊塗塗地了結了一生。在現社會裏，像這種在黑暗中摸索了一生的女子是很多很多的，（人生）都給她們提醒了。林楚楚呢，她是一個認敎育兒童爲終身任務的人類的母親。她棄絕了一切慾念，盡她的一生精力去從事敎育兒童。但這種理想的女性恐怕永在理想中吧！</p>
<p>作者並提出了社會敎育及家庭敎育問題。他說明了一個人的思想行爲及品性，社會敎育和家庭敎育比學校敎育更爲重要，社會和家庭環境的優劣給人們的影響是無限的大。這是誰都知道的，但誰都這樣糊塗地過去了。這是値得一般敎育家嚴重注意的。</p>
<p>再說到一個靑年的出路問題。一個靑年的不滿於自已的生活而找尋遠大的出路。那是極正當的，但是要切實注意的是當心踏進危險的境界，甚至找到死路。（人生）裏的靑年就是一例，他因不慣小學敎員的淸苦而找出路，結果却弄到自殺。這是靑年們一個極好的敎訓。　　總之，看完了（人生）猶似聆到了一番哲理的敎訓。回味起來有無限的快感。</p>
<h3 id="c241">（人生）的滋味怎樣？ <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 喻比</p>
<p>一個（女人，）從（野孩子，）（奴婢），（女工），而成了一個（路柳牆花），她還以爲是嘗盡了（人生）的滋味。一個小學敎員，他覺得他的（生活）太平凡，於是他離開了妻子，去大都市找新生路。不期而然他與她就結合了，一年後生了一個孩子。她以爲過了半生苦日子，應得享受一下，於是漸漸地不能維持，使他墮入歧途。他想到孩子的生命，於是寫信給前妻，呌她收撫這孩子，自已投</p>
<p>進大海，了結他們的（人生）。漂泊一生的她，於是覺悟了，領了一個没母親的小孩做兒子。她想起親生的兒子，於是去抱了來，和這一個孩子同住。因爲受着不同的敎育，孩子與孩子爭吵了。於是親生的兒子又被丈夫的前妻抱了去。十五年的過去，她是老了，被一個領兒子趕出了。那裏是她的歸宿呢？她没有勇氣去見親生的兒子，終於在一天，她是倒在地上死了，了結她的（人生）。（人生）的滋味怎樣？（人生）的滋味，原來是一包苦水。</p>

<p>— 克洛</p>
<p>這部片子以提倡國貨抵制外貨爲中心意職，似乎是很正確的；然而牠内邊竟歪曲事實，朦蔽眞理，令人看過後，立刻就想到（惡意的宣傳）上邊去。</p>
<p>故事中叙述貨物（注意：這裏並未註明（仇）貨或（日）貨諸字樣）檢查會的威權是如何的大，公安局加緊偵查冒牌貨是何等熱心，果能如此，那我們還有什麽話可說？祗是實際上所見到的是外貨檢查會的被封解散，檢查員的被捕入獄，仇貨在我國的暢銷無阻，這都是鐵一般的事實！</p>
<p>因此，我們看到牠怎樣遠離了現實，而在迷迷糊糊的夢藝着。那平庸卑劣的說敎，令人欲嘔！</p>
<p>至於技巧方面，還不能令人滿意。導演雖然施用了許多小聰明｜｜如以那小孩發現了期父皮鞋底下的破洞，以表現其窮困狀態，及以長長的烟灰來表明</p>
<p>李會計的焦急：都是很好的｜然而，終於是些小聰明而已｜攝影有許多塲面要不得，如克儉夜間去偵查冒牌貨時，光綫與白日無異！演員都似乎有點呆板，飾刁仁之張振鐸倒很靈活稱職，只是有許多地方很做作。克儉的病母並無病態，很顯然的在那裏裝病。葉秋心在這部影片中不過是個普通角色，未能有充分的表現。</p>
<h3 id="c243">倉隠秋佳節思親 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 佈景板</p>
<p>（獨在異鄕爲異客，每逢佳節倍思親，遙知兄弟登高處，徧揷茱萸少一人。）這是唐詩中的一首佳節思親詩，字裏行間，寫出遊子的心，可謂透澈之至　　不料故人詩句，却爲今人寫照，電影界中有一位女星倉隠秋，幾年前一個人從河南到上海，雖仗其聰明及努力之下，如今在電影界中已佔着一席地位，可是孤單單地飄泊異鄕，白雲落月，常念故里，有時竟會廢枕忘餐，實在是一椿可慨的事。</p>
<p>日前，在藝華公司遇見這位倉隠秋小姐，我從她的口中，知道她在（女人）中有戲，並且是合於她的個性的戲，當我們正在談話的辰光，忽然外面傳來了一種暴裂的聲音，倉隠秋聽了便問：（這是不是爆竹的聲音嗎。）</p>
<p>旁邊有一個人立刻回答：（不差，那無非又是執於成見的那種鄕下人在所謂謝年罷了。）誰知他這句話不打緊，却觸動了這位善思姑娘倉隠秋的心，她當卽在面部上露出凝凈的神情，木然不動，而似乎又有所思了。　　大家瞧了覺得很奇怪，於是爭相詢問，爲什麽突然的呆立起來？倉隠秋便淡然地說道：（我獨個兒在上海，每過一次年，總要流幾次眼淚！原來你們不知道我家鄕還有父母在盼望我呢···，）她說到這裏，兩隻眼睛好像有些潤</p>
<p>濕了！那許多人聽了，一齊的把頭垂下來，空氣也就立卽靜寂，自然，大家都對倉隠秋表示深切的同情了。</p>

<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>那少年欽差又問克利斯丁娜道：（此處離最近的客店還有多少路？）克利斯丁那笑道：（還有六哩多路。你到那裏，天將夜了。當然，你倘使再陷在溝裏就不成了。）那少年深深地鞠了一躬道：（謝謝你的好意）他又因爲克利斯丁娜穿了男裝，當她是個男孩子，所以就吩咐他的僕人道：（比特羅，給這個童子一個金鎊。）他說定了，就回進車子裏去了。克利斯丁娜從那僕人乎裏，拿了一個金鎊。她笑著將那個金鎊在乎裏翻來翻去看著，那金鎊上面，刻著她自已的面容，四週還有（瑞典女王克利斯丁娜陛下）幾個字，她拿金鎊裝在衣袋裏，然後看著那隊車輛走了。歐拉夫拿馬牽了過來，帮她跨上去。他們慢慢走著。克利斯丁娜走了一段，又將馬勒住了。她坐在馬上想了一回，又看看那隊人馬去的路。她突然間將馬調了頭，向著那隊人馬追上去了。</p>
<p>不久他們已經追到那隊人馬的旁邊。她故意地脫了帽子，在馬上向那車中的少年鞠著個深深的躬。那車中人亦同樣的還了一個禮。克利斯丁娜心中暗笑著，就趕到前面去了。歐拉夫還在後面緊緊跟著。將近日暮黃昏的時候，他們已經到了一個客店。她在門口勒住了馬鞠，將馬交給客店的夥計，她和歐拉夫，就進了店。她進了店，向四週圍看著。幾間矮矮的木屋，裏面點了幾支臘燭，壁鑪裏燒着木柴，發出熊熊的火光，許多農家男女圍坐着吃東西，還有幾個在假的兵士。夥計們托着大盤子，往返奔忙着。在火上還燒着一大塊肉，使歐拉夫看了，纔涏欲滴起來。克利斯丁娜用淸脆的聲音喝問着：（店主在那裏？）一個肥胖的人跑到她前面問道：（客人要什麽？）克利斯丁娜道：（晚飯，房間，一張床。）那店主將她上下估量了一番，然後說道：（祇有一間屋子了。那是頂好的一間，專門爲貴客用的，房金要十兩。）克利斯丁娜回頭對著歐拉夫道：（給他二十兩！）　　那店主如同接到了財神似的，深深鞠着躬。他一方面接着錢，一方面連忙領路，連聲喊着（大人），將他們領到樓上一間大屋子。那裏面有一張四個柱子的大床，一張桌子，一面鏡子，幾張椅子。一個牆壁大火爐裏，木頭已經裝好，祇要一點就着。克利斯丁娜脫下帽子，撣去了上面的雪。她像一個淘氣的孩子，對於這種頑皮的事，覺得非常高興。歐拉夫在屋子裏佈置着臥具，克利斯丁娜就走到屋子外面走廊上，望下看着，心裏急切地盼望那隊西班牙人的來到。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping Dispatch from Ningxia) The Sun army's front line is thirty miles away from Ninguan Fort. Although minor skirmishes have not ceased, there is no fierce fighting. The overall commander of the Ningxia front is Ma Hongkui, the commander of the 35th Division and the Gansu-Ningxia Border剿匪 region. The Sun army is in a dilemma. In order to leave himself a way out, Sun has sent representatives to Ma to negotiate a ceasefire. Currently, Sun's representatives, Lu Yuting and Gao Meng□, carrying Sun's letter, have arrived in Ningxia city and are meeting with Ma to discuss ceasefire measures. Sun has repeatedly clarified that his westward advance is not to interfere in politics and that all post-war matters will be resolved by the Central Government. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Guihua Dispatch: The Sun army besieging Ningxia numbers as many as 15,000. Ma's troops and garrison firmly defend the city walls. When Pingluo was captured by the Sun army, the regimental commander of the military division, Ma Baolin, was killed in action. A small detachment of Yang Hou triggered a landmine in Pingluo, killing more than 700 people. The three counties of Jinji, etc., have also been occupied by the Sun army.

<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin told reporters that the authorities repeatedly telegraphed orders to stop the Sun-Ma conflict, but Sun consistently defied the orders. The government then issued an official order dismissing Sun from all concurrent positions and transferring his cavalry to Yu Shiming and his infantry to Liu Yueliang and Ding Futing to lead them to retreat to the area north of Dengkou, in compliance with the order to reduce the size of the force. If Sun still disobeys, the Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shanxi armies will encircle and thoroughly resolve the situation. Yan Xishan's views on resolving this issue are completely consistent with the Central Government and the Beiping authorities. When Sun was fighting the Japanese in Rehe, the Japanese army attacked with the Motegi Brigade of 1,200 men. Sun, with an entire army, telegraphed the authorities for emergency assistance, claiming to be isolated and without support. During the emergency of the Luan River battle, Sun's army suddenly withdrew and arbitrarily expanded its forces. Sun's troops, as approved by the Military Affairs Commission, were seven regiments, but Sun expanded them by several times the authorized number, causing food and supplies to be insufficient. The east of Chahar has now been pacified. Liu's bandit troops have been intercepted by various armies and more than half have been eliminated. There are now only a little over a thousand remaining, who have fled to the vicinity of the Xin Di area on the Daqing Road. The various armies are still engaged in suppression operations, and it should be no problem to eliminate them. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Ge Wuqi, the Ningxia Provincial Committee member, reported that Sun Dianying intended to dominate the Northwest, privately expanding his army and incorporating bandits to more than 60,000 men. Currently, the military affairs of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are entirely under the responsibility of Zhu Shaoliang, not a single action by Ma Hongkui. The generals of the three provinces are committed to obeying orders and protecting the people. Extraterritorial actions to Sun will face real sanctions. Zhu Shaoliang commands troops, including Ma Hongkui's division of 20,000 men, Hu Zongnan's division of more than 20,000 men, Ma Hongbin's division of more than 10,000 men, Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing's combined forces of 25,000 men, Deng Baoshan's division of 7,000 men, Lu Dachang's division of 10,000 men, and Yang Qutong of 6,000 men.

<p>Chairman Chiang Attends and Gives Instructions</p>
<p>Elucidating the Meaning of the Three Characters (Education), (Nurturing), (Hygiene)</p>
<p>Hosted Zhang Xueliang at Cheng Lu Yesterday</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) At 11 a.m. on the 5th, the Provincial Government held a joint expanded commemoration week of the Party and government in the auditorium. Those present included Chairman Lu Dipin, Lü Bichou, Zhou Junyan, Chen Bulei, Zeng Yangfu, Wang Cheng Ying, Lu Dai, Provincial Party Committee members Wang Tingyang, Fang Qingru, Luo Xiatian, Hu Jianzhong, Zheng Wenli, Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou, and more than 1,000 officials from various departments of the Provincial Government and county magistrates. Chairman Chiang arrived at 11 a.m., and was greeted into the venue by Lu Dipin. After leading the ceremony by Chiang, Chiang gave an earnest speech, the general idea being that Zhejiang had made great progress in construction in the past year. For example, the completion of the Hangjiang Railway, the installation of tap water, and the magnificent horsepower of the power plant were rare in other provinces. It is hoped that comrades from all parties, government, and military will continue to work hard for three years, which can be the basis for the revival of the nation. Later, he said that King Goujian of Yue saved the country with the four words "生聚敎訓" (production, gathering, education, training). In simple terms, it is the three words "敎養衛" (education, nurturing, hygiene). The foundation of education is to make everyone know etiquette, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and understand the principles of being a person and loving the country. The foundation of nurturing is to make everyone know how to make food, clothing, housing, and transportation, how to be neat and clean, and how to conform to the modern social life of diligence, hard work, and courage. As for the word "衛" (hygiene), it cannot be separated from education and nurturing. For example, training the protection team or the backbone team must first make them understand etiquette, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and then know neatness and cleanliness, and then teach them how to shoot guns, which is useful. Otherwise, the more force there is, the more unstable the society will be. Finally, he earnestly explained the meaning of "欲民强必先敎民死, 欲民富必先敎民勞" (If you want the people to be strong, you must first teach the people to die for the country; if you want the people to be rich, you must first teach the people to work hard), encouraging everyone to share the responsibility, overcome difficulties, and complete the mission of reviving the nation. The whole audience was moved. Chiang's speech lasted about two hours, and it ended at 1 p.m. He then gathered with the people in front of the Provincial Government gate to take a photo, and then got in the car and returned to Cheng Lu for lunch. (5th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) This morning at 9 a.m., Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Soong Mei-ling, went to the Jianqiao Aviation School by car to attend the joint expanded commemoration week of the military and police and give instructions. At 10:30 a.m., he returned to the city and went to the Provincial Government for the commemoration week instructions. At 1 p.m., he returned to Cheng Lu for lunch. At 2 p.m., he met Xu Peigen. At 3 p.m., accompanied by Soong Mei-ling, he boarded two yachts from the back door of Cheng Lu and went to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in the center of the lake to enjoy tea.

(1) Representatives from the party headquarters of various provinces and cities reported the difficulties of various localities to the Central Government for study in their conversations with the Central Government, such as (1) the current methods of electing various party headquarters have the disadvantages of reducing work efficiency and undermining the spirit of unity, (2) the relationship between local governments and party headquarters is often difficult, causing annoyance, (3) the organizational methods of lower-level party headquarters seem to lack complete and lively spirit, and should be improved.

The Central Government plans to give written instructions to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities on the results of this conversation. (2) The Three Principles of the People Literary Movement has so far had little effect. Personally, I believe that the following three things should be recognized: (1) we should grasp the spirit of history and the times, (2) we should understand the literary genius and methods of the Premier, and take the material of saving the country and adapting to the needs of the masses as the standard for literary creation, and (3) literature should be discovered from the mouths of the masses, and only in this way can it be successful. (3) I felt that the party affairs in Zhejiang Province were extremely stable when I went to Hangzhou this time. Therefore, I felt that there must be a stable society in order to have a stable group.

<h3 id="e40">Taking Over Shanhaiguan and the Far Eastern Situation Shu <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Since the fall of Linyu on January 1st of last year, followed by the ravaging of Rehe and the threat to Tianjin and Beijing, the entire China was almost completely detached from its peacetime state. When the Tanggu Truce was established, this disguised war between China and Japan came to a halt. However, the disturbances in Luandong and the repeated connivance of the Japanese army, coupled with our country's inability to directly suppress them, have caused the people of Luandong to fall into double suffering. Looking eastward in anticipation, one cannot help but feel grief and indignation. Recently, Japan's diplomatic policy has undergone technical changes, hence the more lenient expression. Therefore, there have been negotiations for the return of the passes of the Great Wall, and it is also rumored that Linyu, the first pass in the world, will be returned on the 10th of this month. Before this takeover, we must learn from our past pain and offer our opinions so that our countrymen can have a renewed understanding and a more in-depth assessment of the current international situation, especially the Far Eastern situation.</p>
<p>First. We must recognize that the return of Shanhaiguan this time is not because the Japanese have awakened and want to fundamentally reconcile with China and voluntarily return it. It is merely a change in diplomatic policy. On the one hand, it aims to ease the momentary anger of our people, and on the other hand, to relax the temporarily tense international situation. Moreover, the area east of Tianjin is full of bandits and thorns. If we do not work hard to govern, it will provide the enemy with a pretext and make us a laughingstock in the international community. If we promote the virtuous and the capable and earnestly reorganize, we will be hindered everywhere and invite future disputes. The difficulty in handling China's diplomatic problems has not yet ended.</p>
<p>Second. We must know that the loss of our country's territory in the past two years or so is far more than just Luandong, and even more than just the Shanhaiguan Pass. The loss of over 4.2 million square miles of land and over 30 million people is being endured with patience and humiliation. If Linyu can indeed be returned as scheduled, our people should not think that this is enough, but should work even harder to find a way to revitalize ourselves.</p>
<p>Third. We must know that since the September 18th Incident, the powers, apart from providing moral assistance through spiritual sympathy, have no other real means. China cannot use force to recover what was lost, nor can it easily defend its borders. China's situation is already very dangerous. Now, the powers are engaged in an economic struggle against Japan, which is very intense. The Japanese also know that their natural resources, industrial organization, and military quality all have shortcomings that are not easy to remedy. Therefore, they have drastically changed their diplomatic policy and temporarily adopted a policy of conservation and development. However, this economic struggle will eventually become a military struggle. At this time, it is impossible for China to maintain peace through arms, and it is difficult to remain strictly neutral. Even joining any side is not allowed by the circumstances. Therefore, we should take advantage of the fact that the situation is not yet settled and the countries are not yet fully prepared to make a thorough assessment and find a good way to strengthen ourselves.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three points, we must further make a detailed analysis of the world situation and have a concrete observation of the Far East. Now, Japan does not dare to engage in military adventures again, but instead seeks to maintain its gains and ensure that its so-called "Japan-Manchuria controlled economy" can be gradually realized. This way, it can ensure its supply of coal and iron, become self-sufficient in agricultural products, and have room for maneuver with the United States and the Soviet Union. The plan to wage war in other countries' territories is still a superior strategy. This is the old trick of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. As for the struggle between Britain and Japan and between the United States and Japan, it is all about the exclusive control of markets. In the short term, the United States may not cross the Pacific to take military offensive measures, and Japan has no ambition to seize the Americas. If relations between China and Japan can be eased slightly, Japan's convenience in developing Eastern markets will be far greater than that of the United States. Britain's current situation is also only to maintain the status quo of its existing interests, so that the so-called economic alliance within the empire can be firmly established and overcome the centrifugal tendencies of its various autonomous territories and colonies. Then, its naval vanguard base, Hong Kong, will definitely have a reliable guarantee due to the construction of the Singapore naval base. The special rights of the Far Eastern market will also not decline. We should assess the Far Eastern situation and look at the overall situation in the Pacific Ocean, and we should immediately issue a profound introspection. It is absolutely inappropriate to repeat the mistakes of the past. Moreover, the return of Shanhaiguan may not be a sign of awakening on the part of others, but we should make a painful and silent recognition. The lessons of Goujian's restoration of his state should ultimately be an ancient mirror for the Chinese people.</p>

<p>To Go to Tianjin This Morning and Return South in Half a Month</p>
<p>Statements Made in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing and Yan Deqing arrived in Beijing by train at 9:00 am on the 5th from Shanghai. Vice Minister Xu Mo and dozens of Foreign Ministry officials greeted them and went directly to official residence No. 7 on the railway to rest. Then, they met with Chairman Lin and President Wang. Wang hosted a banquet for Yan in the evening. Yan is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the morning of the 6th and return to Beijing and Shanghai in half a month. According to Yan, he has been abroad for two years, from Washington to Geneva to Moscow, and may have a gap in his understanding of the domestic situation. Diplomacy is backed by the government and public opinion. Without knowing the government's policy and understanding the trend of public opinion, it is impossible to take measures. The current international situation is extremely urgent, but there will not be drastic changes in four or five months. Therefore, he is returning to the country to ask the government for instructions and to handle personal matters. He will return to Russia in three months at the earliest or half a year at the latest. During this trip to Europe, European countries were quite skeptical of China, but they are still quietly observing our future attitude. The puppet regime is brewing to become emperor, and the countries will definitely not recognize it. Russia is indeed fully prepared for war, but does not want to provoke it. Other countries also hold the same attitude. Our country is currently in an extremely dangerous period, but it is not without a way out. Geneva is one way, Moscow is one way, and Tokyo is also one way, but all should be prepared to overcome difficulties with great determination, so as not to be controlled by others. Not only the government has this preparation, but the whole country must also work together to achieve success. (5th dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Russia and Japan Step Up War Preparations</p>
<p>British Newspaper Publishes Secret Japanese Plan to Attack Russia</p>
<p>Russia and Japan Order Large Quantities of Steel and Iron in the United States (Washington) According to a representative of a major steel factory speaking to reporters, Russia plans to order steel and iron worth millions of dollars in the United States. Recently, Russia has inquired about all prices from more than 1,600 steel factories in the United States, mostly regarding steel pipes and steel rails for oil mining and other materials for transportation, in preparation for a war with Japan. The National Trade Bank, which is being planned by President and Director-General of the Financial Relief Bureau Jones, may accept this credit loan. However, there is a reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Russia, and Russia will also import a large number of export goods into the United States, so very little cash is needed for trade between the two countries. According to a report from the US Department of Commerce, US exports to Russia in December of last year were $570,269, compared to only $186,310 the previous year.</p>
<p>Russian imports into the United States in December of last year totaled $1,071,550, an increase of $552,817 compared to the previous year. Russia has been vigorously purchasing steel and iron materials in recent years in preparation for a Russo-Japanese war, while Japan is also actively preparing. Last year, Japan ordered a not small amount of steel and iron in the United States, totaling 592,536 tons, an increase of 401,343 tons compared to the previous year. According to the US, last year's total steel and iron exports were 1,350,692 tons, with total national exports of $1,675,020,000, with cotton exports accounting for the largest share at $398,212,263.

<p>(London) The Daily News today published an article by Cummings entitled "Japanese War Plan," accompanied by a detailed map of Japanese marching traffic in northern Manchuria. According to reports, the map was obtained from a high-ranking official, has never been published, and the powers are not fully aware of it. The map shows that Japan plans to build a railway from Qiqihar to Sakhalin, and a military road from Harbin to Lahasusu, bypassing the side of the proposed Jiagou (transliteration) to Ningguta and Lahasusu railway. It also plans to build a railway from Solun to Hailar, so that there will be a double line directly to Manzhouli. The article also states that aircraft fields have been built in Hailar, Mogen (transliteration), Sakhalin, Manzhouli, Ningguta, Mishan, Suifenhe, and other locations along the Soviet-Russian border, and a military highway of 7,360 kilometers is currently under construction.

<p>(Moscow) The Japanese (Nichi Nichi Shimbun) reported that Britain and Japan have reached a gentleman's agreement on foreign policy. The Pravda commented on this, saying, "If the news reported by the Nichi Nichi Shimbun is true, then this repeatedly proves that the British imperialist's aid to Japanese imperialism is not only not weakening, but is increasing day by day. The British people's open aid to Japan's invasion of Manchuria, the clear and unambiguous statement they have made, is that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations does not lose its right to rule the trust islands in the Pacific, and the desire to express its invisible loan policy through the method of not taking opposing Japanese dumping, etc., is a mark of this policy, and the conclusion of the gentleman's agreement is a completion of this policy. British imperialism is directing the main direction of its foreign policy towards competition with the United States, and is organizing anti-Soviet Union actions, while at the same time retaining its alliance with Japan by all means. The gentleman's agreement that is currently being transmitted is the condensation point of this alliance." (4th dispatch from TASS)</p>

Local newspapers have been paying close attention to Ellen B's whereabouts. Some say that he has changed his plans and gone to Java from other places, and others say that he is attending the naval conference. The average person is in the dark about what is being discussed, and those who have experienced the last war especially hope not to see war again. However, it is universally acknowledged that we cannot sit here and wait for death. Many houses in our coastal recreation area have been taken over by the military, and our beautiful airport will soon be used for monsters such as tanks to practice. As for the situation in the air, what is known is that in the recent joint exercise of the naval and air forces, one plane crashed. The reason is said to be that the fog was so thick that they could not see each other. The residents are all anxious about how to avoid air raids and how to dig bomb shelters. The only solution is to dig tunnels in all our small hills. (January 20th, Singapore correspondence from the North China Daily News)</p>

<p>Conclusion of a Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Still Uncertain</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In this afternoon's Budget General Assembly, after questions and answers between Seiyukai's Kiyose Kikuo and Navy Minister Osumi regarding naval issues, he questioned the Foreign Minister, saying, "Japan's credibility seems to be causing considerable misunderstandings in the world. What will the authorities do?"</p>
<p>Hirota replied, "If the people's beliefs are firm, then misunderstandings will naturally be swept away. The government should, of course, make every effort to make people recognize the true Japan. Therefore, efforts have not been relaxed in this regard." Kiyose then asked, "Since the rejection of the non-aggression treaty, how should the authorities deal with the changes in Japanese-Soviet relations?" The Foreign Minister replied, "Japan has not yet rejected the non-aggression treaty and intends to study it in detail in order to deal with it. The Soviet Union has continuously wanted to find ways to resolve the problems between the two countries. Japan has long held the policy of first resolving outstanding issues and then contacting the non-aggression treaty. I think that if the outstanding issues are resolved, then it may not be impossible to conclude the treaty." Then, Mr. Washino reiterated the theory of respecting the people and pressed the Minister of Commerce and Industry. There were many more questioners. Because today was the last day of the Budget General Assembly, the intensity of the debate was extraordinary. The meeting adjourned at over 6:00 pm, which was past the scheduled time.

<p>(Washington) The US government's budget needs to be in deficit by $2,000,000,000, but today the Finance Department said that since the dollar was devalued to fifty-nine cents and six mills, there can now be a surplus of one trillion dollars. According to the statement, after the dollar depreciation, the government profited $2,805,512,061, so the cash balance in the treasury at the end of January was $4,064,781, and on February 1, it changed to $7,018,263,781.

<h3 id="e50">Roosevelt Decides to Further Devalue the Gold Dollar <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(London) A report from Washington states that the Treasury Department suddenly announced that the equalization fund has not yet been established, temporarily alleviating concerns that the United States will use this fund to instigate a currency war. It is rumored that the United States has not sought opinions from London or Paris regarding currency stabilization issues. According to general opinion, there is no basis for formal discussion until the dollar has reached its correct standard price and its value has been reduced. However, President Roosevelt is still determined to further devalue the dollar. Reuters' New York dispatch states that Mr. Gannett, who recently visited the White House, is confident that the price of gold must continue to rise, as the current price only prevents prices from falling. The Brookings Institution in the United States, the highest authority on American economic and financial matters, also expressed its opinion through its currency expert, Mr. Pasvolsky, that prices have only risen by 20%, while the price of gold has already risen by 60%. The amount of gold flowing into the United States from England recently is still limited, which is only due to shipping companies being unwilling to transfer large quantities of private gold and fast ships not sailing frequently. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's London gold price is 140 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the French franc exchange rate, but about 2 shillings lower than the New York price. Therefore, the price difference between Paris and New York is over 7 shillings. This is why £1,540,000 worth of gold was sold in London, and a large amount of cash was transferred to New York. Although a lot of cash is being transferred to the United States, the dollar has shown no signs of weakness. It is expected that this trend of the dollar will continue as gold can be continuously shipped out in Europe. This is because the return of funds has just begun, and European investment in New York securities is booming. In addition to this temporary reason, the United States has a continuing favorable trade balance, which may encourage gold to flow to New York in the future. The purpose of American policy is to increase export trade, but it is unwilling to receive foreign goods to offset the price of American goods, nor is it willing to retain surplus funds abroad. Therefore, all parties believe that the time is not yet ripe for the British authorities to stabilize the pound sterling. The Financial News stated that banks believe that the suspension of the gold standard by France and other gold-using countries is a matter of time, and some criticize France's policy of maintaining its un-conservative position, resulting in the consumption of gold reserves.

<h3 id="e51">Balkan Pact Established <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>United Opposition to Revising Treaties</p>
<p>Bulgaria Still Needs to be Brought On Board</p>
<p>Belgrade – The four major Balkan countries have now completed a united front to oppose Italy's proposal to revise the Treaty of Versailles. These four countries are Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Their main purpose is economic and political cooperation, with a particular emphasis on united opposition to the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. The foreign ministers of the four countries have held multiple meetings within 48 hours and have today signed the agreement they have negotiated. Although the full text of the agreement has not been published, it is reliably reported that the above points are its outline. This agreement guarantees peace between the signatory countries, so it is generally referred to as the Locarno Pact of the Balkans. However, Bulgaria, which is currently the cornerstone of the Balkans, has not yet joined, so the agreement cannot yet be regarded as complete. The signatory countries are now making every effort to persuade Bulgaria to join, but the other party has not yet expressed its approval. Bulgaria currently insists on several requirements as conditions for joining the agreement. These requirements are: (1) Bulgarian minorities in neighboring countries should enjoy freedom of education, religion, and language; (2) equality in armaments; (3) land access to the Aegean Sea, claiming that this was promised by the Treaty of Neuilly. Greece has resolutely refused to allow Bulgaria to have this corridor, believing that this would cause Greece to lose its richest tobacco-producing province. It was initially feared that Yugoslavia would not want to offend Bulgaria and might not sign the agreement, but it has now also joined. King Alexander of Yugoslavia is more politically astute than most monarchs and is expected to strongly urge King Boris of Bulgaria to join the agreement. Although no one expects all of Bulgaria's demands to be acknowledged, it is hoped that a compromise can be reached. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Past Mistakes are Like Yesterday's Death</p>
<p>Belgrade – A communiqué was issued here, stating that the foreign ministers of Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia have initialed the final and definitive clauses of the Balkan Peninsula Agreement and have decided to hold a formal signing ceremony in Athens this week. The full text of the agreement will be published immediately after the signing. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens – The Balkan countries' agreement was initialed yesterday in the Yugoslavian capital. Prime Minister Tsaldaris made the following statement to the press regarding this matter: (The Balkan countries' agreement safeguards the borders of each contracting state and does not oppose any country. Its conclusion is indeed a major event. The establishment of this agreement not only guarantees peace in the Balkans but also allows countries to trust each other, which benefits general peace. This agreement establishes the foundation for close and proper cooperation in the Balkan Peninsula, which is greatly beneficial to the development of economic and other interests. I firmly believe that all nations that desire peace will warmly welcome this agreement, and not long after, other Balkan countries such as Bulgaria and Albania will also be able to join together.) (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – The Balkan Peninsula Agreement, which was initialed this afternoon, has a validity period of five years. The communiqué issued a moment ago did not indicate the contents of this agreement. Political circles explained the reason for the silence, saying that this agreement still needs to be submitted to Bulgaria for its accession. For the sake of prudence towards Bulgaria, its contents are not being disclosed. The "Political Newspaper" recently wrote an article on the Balkan Pact, proposing a slogan: (The Balkans are for the Balkan people.) It also stated that the ideal of national unity, which is unacceptable to most nations in Europe, has now begun to be realized in the Balkan Peninsula. Europe already has a (Western Locarno Pact,) and now it is supplemented by an (Eastern Locarno Pact.) The various past mistakes and faults of the Balkan countries are like yesterday's death. Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey are ready to move towards the path of tranquility and security. What will be Bulgaria's attitude? Will it continue to wallow in the scope of foreign conspiracies? If Bulgaria still holds a wait-and-see attitude and wants to take risks and chances as in the past, then it is indeed a big mistake. After the four countries in the Balkan Peninsula are united, they will surely make such adventurous attempts impossible to succeed. Conversely, if Bulgaria joins the agreement, it can join the rest of the countries in working for peace in the Balkan Peninsula. As far as we ourselves are concerned (referring to Yugoslavia), we must do everything we can to ensure the implementation of the second method, because only Bulgaria's accession to the agreement is Bulgaria's only turning point. Moreover, the results of the Balkan Entente will soon have an impact on European politics. The Balkan Peninsula has always been a volcano in Europe, but it will not be so in the future. As far as Turkey is concerned, its territory in Europe has been secured, so it can concentrate on seeking the consolidation of its own country. Although former Greek Prime Minister Venizelos is no longer in his position, his policies have indeed been implemented. Its territorial integrity has been secured, and its domestic political situation has also been stabilized. As for Romania, the former great politician Xanasca and his disciple, the current Foreign Minister Titulescu, have always strongly advocated the Balkan Pact. Now that their proposals have been realized, they can also be proud of themselves. As for our country (referring to Yugoslavia), we have become a strong fortress for the independence of the Balkan countries and the most solid guarantee for Balkan peace. This is our glory.)

Suma has been in China for many years and has served in Beiping, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, and other places. Now he is succeeding as the Consul-General in Beiping and will surely be able to perform his duties happily.

<p>(Nanjing) Since the issue of receiving the Eastern Tombs has been handled by a receiving committee jointly formed by the Ministry of Education and other departments, together with the Hebei Provincial Government, there has been no progress due to Japanese and puppet obstruction.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industries, although there is a plan for an artificial silk manufacturing factory, it is being prepared by silk merchants from Hangzhou, Huzhou, Suzhou, and other places. The factory site is planned for Kunshan, covering an area of 480 mu. The method of raising funds was initially planned to use the funds obtained from the increased tax on artificial silk as the factory's preparatory funds. Because this could not be done, it was changed to government appropriations, but the government currently has no funds, or the business community is ordered to raise funds on its own. Therefore, this plan is difficult to realize for the time being. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries held a meeting last year on the issue of relief for national coal, but there was no solution.

It is planned to hold another meeting in the near future, and the proposals and matters to be discussed have been planned. As for the case of issuing 20 million yuan in coal industry public bonds, it is feared that it will be difficult to realize because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance.

<p>(Paris) The atmosphere in Paris is very tense. The Parisian defense forces have been ordered to remain in their camps, as have the suburban defense forces, to prevent accidents. The number of police officers stationed on the streets of Paris, which used to be sufficient with just one person, has now been increased to three or four. Cavalry are stationed near the Chamber of Deputies, but soldiers will not appear on the streets as long as the police can maintain order. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government will fight for its survival in the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow. The debate in the Chamber is expected to be very fierce, and the fate of the Daladier cabinet hangs in the balance. Since the discovery of the Bayonne fraud case, Paris has been the center of an uproar, especially today. The government's mobilization of troops to prevent disturbances during tomorrow's debate has aroused the anger of the opposition. According to a right-wing organ, tanks are currently being driven out of the Compiègne military camp, and two detachments of troops have been ordered to go to Paris. In addition, the troops stationed in the Paris area have received instructions to prepare for an emergency, as it is rumored that the royalists are planning to launch a demonstration. Tomorrow's debate in the Chamber will be very intense, but since the Socialist Party has decided to support the government because of the dismissal of Police Chief Chiappe, the Daladier government can be temporarily preserved, and those who support Daladier also welcome his skills in dealing with difficult situations.

<p>Paris Police Chief Dismissed</p>
<p>Prime Minister Declares a Thorough Investigation of the Fraud Case</p>
<p>(Paris) The dismissal of the Paris Police Chief, nicknamed (Napoleon of Paris), Mr. Chiappe, by the new Prime Minister Daladier was done in consultation with the Socialist Party, giving this position to a Socialist Party member, thereby gaining the support of the Socialist Party, as the Socialist Party had long wanted to remove Mr. Chiappe. With the support of the Socialist Party, Prime Minister Daladier may not fail in the debate in the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday. The reorganization of the cabinet, such as Marchandeau as Minister of Finance and Penancet as Minister of War, are all results of Mr. Chiappe's dismissal. However, although the Daladier government has the support of the Socialist Party, its lifespan is still uncertain. Whether it can support itself for two months like the Chautemps government is still uncertain. Mr. Cipo, the Governor of the Seine Province, has now replaced Mr. Chiappe as the Paris Police Chief and took office this morning, immediately engaging in maintaining public order in Paris. Daladier declared that he is determined to thoroughly investigate the Bayonne fraud case to find out the truth, which has slightly consolidated his position. Daladier claimed that he did not want to participate in the debate on this case as reported in the newspapers, but wanted to order the investigation committee to proceed as soon as possible after the Congress meeting.

<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies will hold a general political debate tomorrow, with many members signing up to speak. The questions raised by the members are divided into two aspects: one is about the administrative personnel changes decided by the government yesterday, and the other is about the organization of the cabinet. The debate in the Chamber may be extended until late at night before it is over. Former Police Chief Chiappe has refused to take the new position of Governor-General of the Moroccan Federation, as this agency has already reported. It is rumored that many of Mr. Chiappe's former colleagues have expressed sympathy to Mr. Chiappe and personally went to say goodbye, such as the head of the judicial section of the police station, Mr. Ge Xiao, some junior officials, and representatives of the war veterans of the police station, who all personally went to comfort him. Mr. Chiappe was very touched and told reporters on the scene that he deeply regretted the various incidents that occurred during the demonstrations in Paris a few days ago. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Extremists attempted to hold a demonstration on the Champs-Élysées tonight. The police had learned of this in advance and took strict precautions.

The actors and staff of the theater have jointly appealed to the Director of the Fine Arts Department of the Ministry of Education to retain 法白尔. Last night, the theater performed the famous play by the great British poet Shakespeare. After the play, some audience members shouted (Down with Dome) (Support 法白尔). The police came out to suppress them, and the crowd responded with shouts of (Chiappe Long Live). According to the 白日报 and 菲加洛报, the government has mobilized a small number of troops to protect the capital to prevent disturbances that may occur today. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand – The Orthodox Socialist Party held a local congress here. Chairman Blum talked about the administrative measures taken by the government yesterday, saying (When the party caucus met on Thursday morning of last week, it unanimously decided to vote against the government, but since the dismissal of Paris Police Chief Chiappe yesterday, the position taken by the party caucus may change accordingly, but we have not made any demands on the government, and the government has not made any promises to our party either. In recent days, the party caucus and the party headquarters have held several meetings to consider the various measures that our party should take when the political freedom of the working class is threatened.) (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although it is a Sunday rest day today, many members of the Chamber of Deputies are still gathered in the rest room this afternoon to discuss the political situation. Some senators also participated in the talks. The party caucuses did not hold meetings, but based on the talks of the members, it can be inferred that the Daladier cabinet will still rely on the majority faction of the Chautemps cabinet when it first attends the Chamber of Deputies. In other words, the cabinet will be voted in favor by the New Socialist Party, the Orthodox Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and its neighboring party caucuses. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Central Executive Committee of the New Socialist Party held a meeting to study the political situation and passed a resolution to record the administrative measures taken by the government and express satisfaction. It hopes that the government will continue to carry out the cleansing work with perseverance, and the New Socialist Party is prepared to provide loyal assistance. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Has the Power to Appoint and Dismiss Federal Officials</p>
<p>Conflict with Göring Not Resolved</p>
<p>(Berlin) The authorities issued several special orders, the most important of which is that the President granted the power to appoint and dismiss Prussian officials to Prime Minister Hitler. The power to appoint and dismiss officials in the remaining federal states belongs to the respective federal civil affairs chiefs. In the future, the President still has the power to pardon soldiers convicted by military courts, etc., but the power to pardon other cases belongs to Prime Minister Hitler. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's move to reduce the powers of the fourteen federal states and three cities has now been completed. The German Reform Act, which stipulates the reduction of the powers of the federal states, was promulgated today after being signed by President Hindenburg. According to this law, Prime Minister Hitler has the power to appoint and dismiss Prussian officials and has the power of pardon. This approach may lead to a conflict between Hitler and Prussian Prime Minister General Göring. The two leaders often disagree on some important matters, such as the church dispute. Göring advocates radicalism, while Hitler advocates mediation. Previously, the power to appoint and dismiss Prussian officials belonged to Göring, but now this power has been transferred to Hitler. General Göring will surely express his dissatisfaction. Prussia is the largest state in Germany, with a population of 37,000,000 and an area of 113,740 square miles, with Berlin as its capital. Hitler can appoint and dismiss officials in Prussia in accordance with the new law, but the powers of dismissal, appointment, and pardon in other states are delegated to the civil affairs chiefs of the National Socialist Party.

<p>Promotes Military Cooperation Among Baltic States</p>
<p>Riga – Latvian Army Chief of Staff General Kļaviņš published an article in a military magazine discussing the German-Polish non-aggression treaty. Latvian newspapers believe that this article has significant implications. The article stated that although the German-Polish non-aggression treaty is good on the surface, whether its internal intentions are consistent with its appearance is currently something we cannot doubt. If the dispute between Poland and Germany is once eliminated and does not cause any more disputes, then what will be compensated in order to obtain this is a major question. Is it a secret plot by Germany and Poland to change a certain existing system in Europe? If so, then this plan may even be related to our fate, and we must strive for self-defense today. The conclusion of the article is that Latvia needs to increase unity with other Baltic countries, because the Baltic countries are indeed threatened together, and that diplomatic cooperation among the Baltic countries should be supported by close military cooperation.

<p>= Sun's army's three-phase plan for advancing westward =</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Sun Dianying's army is pressing on Ningxia's provincial capital and has been in a stalemate with Ma's army near the city for days. Sun's troops occasionally attack the city, resulting in repeated battles. Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Beijing on the morning of the 2nd, reporting that the enemy troops were stubbornly resisting at Zhujiazai and Beita north of the city and that elite troops have been dispatched to actively suppress them. Ma also urgently telegraphed Deng Baoshan, Commander-in-Chief of the Left Wing, to order Lu Dachang's troops from Ningxia and Shuofang to suppress the enemy. After receiving the telegram, Deng returned from Xi'an to Lanzhou to arrange military affairs. According to a telegram from Lanzhou, the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai have mobilized six divisions, awaiting orders from the Central Government to attack Sun's army. Zhu Shaoliang also organized three support Ningxia columns to advance in different directions to support Ningxia, with Lu Dachang, Yang Qu, and Deng Baoshan serving as commanders. According to a military source, Sun Dianying has established a Ningxia Provincial Government in Dengkou. Lu Fengnian's troops stationed in Baotou have crossed Wuyuan westward to reinforce the front. Because Sun's army suffered too many casualties in the attack on Ningxia, part of the army detoured towards Ningxia and Shuofang in an attempt to cut off the connection between the Gansu and Ningxia armies. Furthermore, the 86th Division stationed in northern Shaanxi and Yue Xiu's troops have been ordered to mobilize and prepare to attack the flanks of Sun's army near Li Gangbao. Jing Shiyuan, originally stationed in Yulin County, dispatched the 258th Brigade to Hengshan, Fugu, and Shenmu Counties after receiving the order. The 125th Brigade was stationed in Bao'an Anzhai and other areas, jointly defending with Lu Dachang's troops from Gansu, under the command of Zhu Shaoliang. Xu Tingyao's troops have also been ordered to prepare to go to Suiyuan to monitor the reorganization of Sun's troops. Wang Jingguo will command his troops to block Sun's troops. If Sun Dianying still refuses to accept the reorganization, a major war in the Northwest may be unavoidable. Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Kang Shishu, the representative stationed in Shanxi, to explain the true situation of the military at the front. It is said that Sun Dianying, having failed to capture Ningxia after a long siege, and lacking supplies and transportation in the rear, is in a dilemma. He recently sent two telegrams to Zhang Guanwu, who had previously been mediating, asking him to intercede with He Yingqin, willing to comply with the order to withdraw, and requesting that senior officials be sent to supervise. After receiving the telegram, Zhang telegraphed Sun from Tianjin, advising him to comply with He Yingqin's order to withdraw troops on the 30th, and saying that even if he managed to capture Ningxia temporarily, how could it last long? Zhang arrived in Beijing last night to meet He, who said that if Sun's army did not comply with the order, the only option was to take the final measures. As for Sun's request to send senior officials to supervise the withdrawal of troops, the Military Council has sent senior staff officer Men Bingyue to Suiyuan. If Sun wants to negotiate, he can discuss with Men nearby without the need to send other senior officials. Zhang Guanwu, who has old friendships with both Sun and Ma, has decided to mediate for peace, hoping for an early end to the war. Song Zheyuan is very concerned about this and has also decided to come forward to mediate, ordering his representatives to discuss with the representatives of both parties stationed in Beijing. Therefore, Zhang Jianhou invited Wang Shiping and Bai Jianmin, the representatives of Sun and Ma stationed in Beijing, and Song's representative, to discuss with Zhang Guanwu and others. He also telegraphed Hu Jiesan in Tianjin to come to Beijing to meet at a certain place tonight (the 3rd) to discuss the first step of the plan. After the principles are agreed upon, they will proceed separately. Hu Jiesan is scheduled to come to Beijing tonight. Han Fuqu, Chairman of Shandong, is also concerned about the war between Sun and Ma and recently sent Liu Xizhong to Beijing, which is related to the peace movement. According to those who came to Beijing from Baotou today (the 3rd), the troops fighting with Ma's troops on the front line in Ningxia are commanded by Ding Futing and Liu Yueting of Sun's army, totaling more than 30,000 people. Sun Dianying is commanding military affairs in Dengkou. The war news received in Baotou said that on the 28th of last month, Sun's army had captured the new Ningxia city. Ningxia originally had two cities, new and old. The new city is seven or eight miles west of the old city. Ma Hongkui's and Ma Hongbin's troops, numbering about 20,000, are defending the old city and confronting Sun's army. Zhu Shaoliang telegraphed Sun's plan to invade the west, saying that, according to Ma Bufang's telegram (dated the 24th), a table of Sun's army's operational plans was seized and is forwarded as follows: (1) The main point of the first phase of the offensive is to first occupy Shizuizi, making it easier for our large army to advance in different directions and take advantage of the victory to go south, avoiding our army's delay in the wilderness. (2) The main point of the second phase of the offensive is the city of Pingluo County. In addition to the cavalry following the plan to cut off the enemy's reinforcements, our army should advance in two directions, with the central route directly attacking the Great Wall, and the left and right wings should use encirclement tactics, first cutting off their reinforcements to discourage them, making it easier for the central route to succeed. Second, attacking Ningxia will cause Pingluo to fall without being surrounded. All our senior commanders must break through Ningxia in the shortest possible time. Cavalry Commander Yu Shiming and Forward Commanders Yang Yaofeng and Gao Xiaxuan should follow the plan, send competent staff officers to search for enemy information, and report at any time. (3) The main point of the third phase should be to use all our strength to defeat the enemy's cavalry and advance to Guangwuzhen and Zhongwei, in order to directly attack Gansu and find a way to capture the rebel Ma Hongkui alive. Our army's plan, though clearly three, is actually one. All our generals must judge clearly and achieve a concerted effect. (3rd)</p>

<p>There are no storms, no sudden heat, and no severe cold here. It is the most peaceful and mild place in the Pacific Ocean. Spring is here all year round, and flowers bloom everywhere. This is the Hawaiian Islands, made up of twenty islands. This is a mountainous place and also volcanic. The natives who live here have not yet shed the barbarism inherited from the past. The total population, including pure natives and mixed-race people, is only about 60,000. Politically, it is nominally ruled by the United States. The governor and officials of various departments are selected by the President of the United States. However, Americans number only 45,000, including expatriate Americans. But there is a phenomenon that makes Americans uneasy and fearful, that is, the number of Japanese immigrants increases every year. There are now almost 140,000 Japanese, ranking first among all the people in Hawaii. Although our Chinese compatriots in Hawaii number only 30,000, they are all very wealthy and have a considerable economic advantage. However, in recent years, affected by the decline of the sugar industry, the overall economic situation is not as good as before. The military facilities here were originally centered on Pearl Harbor. There were originally only 1,600 soldiers and 100 officers, with the aim of maintaining American transportation in the Pacific and preserving the right to navigate the Panama Canal. Coastal batteries and airfields were set up in Pearl Harbor and other important areas, and six barracks were built. Recently, due to the stimulation of Japan's expansion of armaments, especially after the Mukden Incident, Japan not only occupied Manchuria but also wanted to include North China, and even dominate the Pacific. At this time, the United States is, of course, very worried, so it transferred the Atlantic fleet to the Pacific to prepare for any eventuality. Therefore, it is necessary to build a large-scale military port in Pearl Harbor and Honolulu, making this place the base of the United States Navy and Air Force in the Pacific. As a result, the docks have been enlarged, oil storage tanks have been built, and continued expansion is planned, with the aim of giving it the military strength to control the Pacific. However, according to what I have heard here, Japan's military expansion is truly unprecedented in its scale and speed. Americans are naturally very fearful of this, especially Japan's so-called Second Replenishment Naval Plan, which is even more alarming. Before this plan was completed, Japan's auxiliary naval vessels were already much stronger than those of the United States. After this plan is completed, the United States will be at a greater disadvantage. What is the value of the slight superiority of a few capital ships? Moreover, Japan also wants to expand eight air squadrons, which is not enough to threaten Pearl Harbor, but the Philippines and Guam are very dangerous. Therefore, the American naval and political circles believe that a crisis is imminent and that there should be vigilance. Therefore, some people, including Swenson, advocate that the United States should expand its navy and not believe in the current superiority of American capital ships. In particular, the communication of the air squadrons in the Pacific is even more important, because at this moment, or in the near future, the American Navy has no possibility of taking an offensive against Japan, and even a favorable defensive posture is not very reliable. Therefore, in today's situation, the only way to develop aviation and try long-distance flights can create new significance in military affairs. The United States Navy transferred six elite P2 and Y1 type bomber aircraft, organized into a long-range flight team, led by Major McKinnis as the commander of the flight team. The team departed from San Francisco at 0:00 PM (Pacific Standard Time) on January 10 and was discovered outside Honolulu at 0:19 PM on the 11th. At 0:49 PM, it landed in Pearl Harbor, covering a total distance of 2,089 nautical miles and taking a total of 24 hours and 49 minutes. Flying from the base of the U.S. Pacific Navy, San Francisco, to the advanced naval base in the Pacific, Pearl Harbor, in one day and night is a major event in the Pacific and the first act in the competition between the United States and Japan. From this non-stop flight and 15-hour night flight, we have two of the most important understandings: First, the United States will pay more serious attention to changes in the Pacific in the future. If the flight connection between Pearl Harbor and Manila is successful, the problem will become more serious. Second, the role of the Navy will take a back seat, and the competition between the United States and Japan will focus on the Air Force in the future. (January 11, 1934)</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Seventh Route of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army is Organized <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>= Will be trained along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province =</p>
<p>= Fujian Provincial Militia Ordered to be Disbanded =</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the 19th Route Army withdrew from Quanzhou on January 25, they first gathered in Hui'an, and then went to Putian, Fuqing, and Xianyou to gather separately. Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Front, received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering the 19th Route Army to be reorganized into the Seventh Route of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression Army, with Mao Weisui as the Commander-in-Chief and Zhang Yan as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Mao and Zhang immediately telegraphed from the Hui'an army headquarters on the 30th to take office. The original telegram stated, "Having received the appointment certificate No. 1294 from the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Commission of the National Government, I hereby appoint Mao Weisui as the Commander-in-Chief of the Seventh Route of the Eastern Route Army, etc. I have respectfully taken office at the Hui'an defense headquarters on January 30. Weisui et al. are mindful of the ongoing national crisis and pledge to continue to fight with the past spirit of resisting Japan and suppressing communism, to stop disputes and defend against insults, to support the Central Government, to be united in mind and virtue, and to implement from beginning to end. I hope that you will give us guidance from time to time to correct our shortcomings. In addition to submitting reports and issuing orders separately, I respectfully report, Mao Weisui, Commander-in-Chief of the Seventh Route of the Eastern Route Army, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang Yan." After the telegram was sent, the name of the 19th Route Army was immediately canceled. The Seventh Route was organized into four divisions, abolishing brigades, with three regiments per division, and still using the numbers 49, 60, 61, and 78 for the four divisions. Each division has jurisdiction over three regiments, and the commanders above the regimental level are all reassigned by the Central Government. At the same time, the Military Commission announced the appointment of Wu Chengren as the commander of the 49th Division, Chen Pei as the commander of the 60th Division, Yang Tingya as the commander of the 61st Division, and Wen Chaoji as the commander of the 78th Division. Chen Pei was transferred from his current position as the commander of the 28th Brigade of the 10th Division. Wu Chengren is from Pucheng, Fujian, and was transferred from his current position as the deputy commander of the 36th Division and commander of the 106th Brigade. Wen Chaoji is from Guangdong and was transferred from his current position as the chief of staff of the 83rd Division. Yang Tingya was transferred from his current position as the deputy commander of the 3rd Division. All are generals who have contributed to this entry into Fujian. The positions below the division commander will be filled after the completion of the counting. Jiang Dingwen sent Zhao Nan, chief of staff of the Northern Route Front Headquarters, to Quanzhou by air on the 30th to make arrangements. After Mao and Zhang telegraphed to take office, Zhao flew back to the province. At the same time, Jiang telegraphed Xiamen, ordering Zhang Jiong, adjutant of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, to lead a group of adjutants and a platoon of guards to Quanzhou on the 31st to count each unit. Once the counting is completed, the four divisions will be organized according to the organization, and the regimental commanders of each division will then take office. As for the rumors that a part of the troops will be transferred to western Fujian to suppress bandits, it is not reliable. It is only heard that after the four divisions are organized, they will be trained along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province.</p>
<p>Since the 19th Route Army has been completely resolved, in the Longyan area, there is only one regiment of infantry led by Zhou Lixing, who withdrew from Zhangzhou, and one battalion of artillery from the 78th Division, and 600-700 students from the officers' training school, for a total of only 2,600-2,700 people. Together with Xu Minghong's volunteer army, there are no more than 4,000 people. The Central Army has only advanced to Longyan since the 3rd Division recovered Zhangzhou. Therefore, the remaining troops of the 19th Route Army, which retreated to Longyan, can still defend Longyan without leaving. Xu Minghong and Cai Tingkai are also still in Longyan. As for the rumors that the Guangdong army led by Huang Renhuan occupied Longyan, they are also inaccurate. Except for small detachments from each of Huang Renhuan's and Huang Yanzhen's divisions still stationed in Wuping and Shanghang, there are no Guangdong troops entering Yongding, Pinghe, and Zhao'an on the border between Fujian and Guangdong. Also, on the afternoon of January 29, three Guangdong planes flew from Shantou to reconnaissance over Zhangzhou, Pinghe, Zhao'an, and Xiamen, but have not been seen again. As for the Central Army in Zhangzhou, there are only about two regiments, about 3,000-4,000 people, from the 3rd Division, and no large forces. In addition, there are militias and punitive armies everywhere. According to yesterday's (1st) news, a part of the 83rd Division of the Central Army will come to Xiamen from Quanzhou by three ships, Xinfeng, Kunxing, and Taishun, and go to Zhangzhou and then to Longyan. It is heard that they will continue to suppress bandits in western Fujian. Also, the military affairs of Fujian have been completely resolved after the reorganization of the 19th Route Army and the inauguration of Mao and Zhang. From now on, it will move from a military period to a post-war period. Militias in various places will be disbanded in turn. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed to militias in various places on the 30th of last month, ordering them to concentrate on the spot and await reorganization and not to move without authorization. Therefore, Du Qiyun, Yang Fengnian, Lin Zhiyuan, Song Yuanyuan, Xu Ruilin, and others arrived in the province on the 1st to meet with Jiang Dingwen. It is heard that they are all discussing the post-war problems of the militia. (February 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Xiao Ke's Bandit Troops Attacked Gao'an and Were Defeated <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>｜The Pure Bandit Area Has Shrunk Invisibly｜</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Military News, since the Red Bandits have been gradually pushed forward by the National Army's Three Guarantees policy, the pure bandit area in Jiangxi has shrunk invisibly. Now only Ningdu, Ruijin, and Shicheng counties remain. After being strictly blockaded by the National Army, at this time of freezing cold, the general scattered bandits, regardless of their lives, rushed around like boars, foraging for food. They have been repeatedly defeated by the National Army. It is reported that the bandit leader Xiao Ke's troops, numbering about a thousand men and guns, recently vainly attempted to attack Gao'an. They were completely defeated by the National Army, and the remnant bandits fled in a rout. In order to encircle and suppress the bandit den of Kong, the Western Route Army has specially ordered the counties in northwestern Jiangxi to quickly and strictly organize the masses and step up defense to avoid being disturbed. However, it has been found that Yichun, Wanzai, Tonggu, Xiushui, Anyi, Fengxin, Yifeng, Shanggao, Wuning, and Jing'an have not set up sentry posts, which has caused many obstacles. The department has sent personnel to urge them to do so. The funds for this project are tentatively set for three months. A telegram was sent yesterday to the provincial government requesting that the provincial treasury provide monthly payments according to the precedent. After the provincial government approved the telegram, a reply was sent, stipulating the monthly amount of expenses, totaling 1,857 yuan, and telegraphing each county, instructing them to receive the funds monthly in accordance with the regulations. Guangfeng News, the local bandits who are harassing the 15th District of the county were originally led by the puppet regiment leader Wu Guangpi. Wu treated the bandits extremely harshly, and his subordinates hated him to the bone. They had long wanted to take the opportunity to stab him. The other day, when the regiment leader was spreading manure, he was stabbed to death by his subordinates with a spear. Five bandits who plotted to assassinate the puppet regiment leader and searched the body for a Mauser pistol and a White Wave brand handgun each escaped. Gao'an News, at 8:00 PM last night, the 60th Bao of the 1st District was patrolling when three porters suddenly passed by on the road within the sentry line. The sentries Yao Fengxiang and Zhang Qinsheng saw them and immediately issued a password. The porters, upon hearing the sound, abandoned their burdens and fled. The sentries immediately intercepted their burdens. Upon inspection, it was found that there were three loads of salt. They immediately reported to the Bao chief. Upon receiving the news, the Bao chief immediately sent militiamen to track and arrest them. The three salt carriers were captured. It is heard that they and two loads of salt have been escorted to the county government for interrogation. February 3rd</p>
<h3 id="e91">Post-Disaster Yellow River Project Fundraising Methods <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Proposed Jointly by Five Provinces to the Central Government for Handling; Jinan Correspondence: Last year, the Yellow River breached in three places, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. Although the breaches at Lanfeng and Xiaopangzhuang have been closed, the breach at Shitouzhuan on the north bank remains unresolved. With the arrival of freezing temperatures and the accumulation of ice, the project is increasingly difficult to manage, and the disaster remains severe. The embankments along both banks of the river have been washed away, collapsed, and damaged, even more so than before. In the future, if another flood occurs, the consequences would be unimaginable. Recognizing this, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission previously formulated three fundraising methods for post-disaster projects and telegraphed them to the relevant five provincial governments of Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, seeking unanimous approval and requesting the Central Government to allocate funds for construction. The three methods are as follows: (1) Implement surcharges on railways, postal services, and steamships, following the previous Yellow River breach handling methods; (2) Have the relevant provincial governments designate appropriate guarantees, such as local taxes, to issue Yellow River breach closure and post-disaster project bonds; (3) Request the National Economic Council to allocate a certain amount of cotton and wheat loans as subsidies. The authority for the first and second items rests with the Central Government. Regarding the second method, the Shandong Provincial Government has made thorough plans and, after deliberation by the Political Affairs Conference, telegraphed its approval. Other provinces have also unanimously approved. It is reported that a joint request has been submitted to the Central Government for approval. Today (the 3rd), the Provincial Government has instructed the Shandong River Affairs Bureau regarding the case. The original order stated: (The document from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission states that the Yellow River overflowed last year, causing damage to several provinces, and the loss of life and property is incalculable. Currently, the embankments on both banks have been washed away, collapsed, and damaged, even more so than before. If post-disaster repairs are not carried out urgently, then with the imminent arrival of the flood season, not to mention encountering another flood, the collapse and overflow could inundate Wei in the north, potentially affecting Tianjin and Tanggu, and seize Huai in the south, potentially harming Jiangsu and Anhui. The devastation would be unimaginable. Even if a normal water level is encountered, the residents along the river will inevitably suffer many hardships. The Commission, responsible for river management, looks ahead with great anxiety. It has dispatched personnel separately to assess the post-disaster projects, but construction has not yet begun due to financial difficulties. The current situation is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. Three fundraising methods are proposed: (1) Implement surcharges on railways, postal services, and steamships, following the previous Yellow River breach handling methods; (2) Have the relevant provincial governments designate appropriate guarantees, such as local taxes, to issue Yellow River breach closure and post-disaster project bonds; (3) Request the National Economic Council to allocate a certain amount of cotton and wheat loans as subsidies. Although the above two methods may inevitably increase the burden on local people, it is necessary for preventing disasters, protecting people's lives and property. It is proposed that the Commission, in conjunction with your government, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and the governments of Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, jointly telegraph the Central Government for approval. If you agree, please reply by telegram so that we can proceed. Commissioner Kong Xiangrong has been dispatched to make contact and send separate telegrams. This telegram is sent for your information. We previously telegraphed that (items 1 and 2 can be handled as proposed, the authority rests with the Central Government, please take the lead in drafting a joint telegram, and the second item, which requires local guarantees for the issuance of bonds, will be submitted after careful planning.) Subsequently, the Secretariat of the Provincial Government forwarded a telegram from Commissioner Kong Xiangrong, and the 294th Political Affairs Conference resolved to (reply by telegram with approval). In addition to replying by telegram and distributing it separately, Commissioner Kong Xiangrong's telegram is copied and sent to the Bureau for its information. This order.) (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Shandong Library Theft Case: Court Begins Investigation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>｜Principal Offender Si Zhengmin Changes Testimony｜Jinan Correspondence: Si Zhengmin, the suspect in the theft of antiques from the Shandong Provincial Library, was transferred from the Military Law Office to the Shandong Higher Court for handling yesterday, as reported previously. After accepting the case, the Shandong Higher Court determined that it should be handled by the Procuratorate of the First Instance District Court and returned the case to that office the day before yesterday. Prosecutor Zhu Weiran of the District Procuratorate accepted the case for handling. Yesterday (the 2nd), Prosecutor Zhu began the first investigation in the Second Investigation Court of the District Procuratorate. First, he ordered the bailiffs to bring the suspects Si Zhengmin and his wife from the detention center. He questioned Si Zhengmin about the process of stealing the antiques. After Si Zhengmin stated his place of origin, age, and occupation, he said that on January 21, at dawn, he (Si referring to himself) went to Daming Lake to skate. He noticed a person standing alone by the riverbank, with his eyes fixed on him. He became suspicious and left the lake. The person saw him move and ran to the base of a tree not far away. At this time, he saw that two people were already squatting under the tree. As he approached, they dispersed. When he reached the tree, he saw two straw bags placed by the river, as well as five porcelain plates that were not wrapped. There was also a small boat in the river. He recognized the items as those displayed in the library and thought they had been stolen. He initially intended to return them to the library, but feared being accused of theft. He then placed the straw bags on the boat and hid the porcelain plates at the bottom of the lake. He used the small boat to transport the items to the west side of the Li Gong Temple, so that he could take them home and store them temporarily. After only one day, he feared that the porcelain plates in the water would be stolen or damaged, so he went to retrieve them on the 23rd of this month and was arrested. He was repeatedly interrogated by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Military Law Office. He had to give the previous account of the situation under severe interrogation. Given the size of the missing items, it was impossible for him to steal them alone. He unfortunately found them and was arrested. He has no way to defend himself. The three thieves were strangers to him, and he does not know their names. Since the thieves cannot be arrested, he cannot escape responsibility. He hopes to be treated leniently when sentenced. He is extremely grateful, and so on. The prosecutor then said, "Your statement is clearly an attempt to evade responsibility. The testimony is self-contradictory. Who are you trying to blame? You said yourself that you could not have done this alone, and people believe that one person could not have done this. But they cannot believe that there was no one else involved in the theft," and so on. The prosecutor then questioned Si's wife, Zhao. After questioning for about three hours, they were dismissed from the court. Si Zhengmin and his wife were returned to detention to await further investigation. (3rd)</p>

<p>Seven robbers armed with weapons suddenly broke into the home of Liu Guanfu, a villager in Xinzhuang 39th District, at the end of last month and robbed him. The local Fifth Police Station was notified to investigate. After investigation by detective Qu Liansheng, it was discovered that a local resident, Xu Yisheng, pawned items at the Huichang Pawnshop in Xujiahui, Shanghai, and tore up three pawn tickets and threw them on the ground as he left. Deeming this suspicious, Qu returned to Xin on the 2nd. At around 9 PM that night, he saw Xu Yisheng lying in a horizontal position in a smoking den in the town. He took Xu back to the station for investigation. Xu confessed immediately and admitted his guilt. He also implicated his accomplice, Tan Baoxing, who had also been present at the robbery. Tan was also subsequently arrested. A written confession was recorded, and they were escorted to Songjiang for legal proceedings today (the 5th).</p>

<p>The silk factory industry in Wuxi has suffered significant losses due to the tragic decline of the silk market and sluggish foreign sales. Most factories have ceased production. Only twelve companies, including Huaxin, Yongtai, and Ganxing, are struggling to remain open, accounting for only a quarter of the industry at its peak. Their situation is also precarious. Recently, the Silk Industry Control Council will soon be established in Hangzhou, and silk sales in Europe and America have gradually improved as various silk factories resume work. The Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association recently held a meeting in Shanghai to discuss ways to rescue Chinese silk. It has been approved by the Economic Commission to allocate 2 million yuan from the American wheat loan for the rescue of the silk industry after the establishment of the Silk Industry Control Council. Therefore, silk factories in Shanghai are preparing to resume production. However, the factories in Wuxi that have already stopped production must wait until the silkworm season this spring for the silk market to improve before there is any hope of recovery.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, a modern woman, named Chen Qiyun, arrived at the Wuxi Hotel near the Gongyun Bridge. She wore a bluish-gray coat with a black leather collar, a black brocade crepe camel hair qipao, and a white cotton short shirt inside. She was beautiful, about twenty years old, and could speak Mandarin, Shanghainese, and Suzhounese. She booked Room 33 and then moved to Room 28. She acted generously. Until the night before last, five men visited the woman one after another and talked intimately until late at night before leaving. At around 1 PM yesterday, three more men went to visit her. The tea boy opened the door and entered, only to find Chen moaning on the bed, pale. The tea boy knew something was wrong and immediately took her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was determined that she had ingested raw opium. Treatment was immediately administered, and she was fortunate to survive. According to Chen, she was originally from Peiping but moved to Shanghai at a young age. Her father was a judge at the Shanghai District Court and is now deceased. She attempted suicide because of a failed love affair. At around 10 PM that evening, Lu Fengqi, Zhou Ruquan, Gu Huai, and others visited the hospital.

<p>The Wuyi Manufacturing Machinery Industry Association, reporting that the new tax on kerosene has been implemented, requires an additional 25 yuan in customs duties per ton of diesel fuel for machinery, equivalent to 48.2 yuan in national currency. The price of diesel fuel this year is 80 yuan in national currency. After the implementation of the new tax, the price per ton will increase by 62.5 percent, almost two-thirds. Diesel fuel engines are used for agricultural irrigation, rice milling, oil extraction, river dredging, and as the original power source for small factories. They are not comparable to luxury goods. Once the tax is increased, the entire rural industrial sector will be greatly affected. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and submitted it to party headquarters at all levels, requesting the government to immediately stop the tax and allow the withdrawal of the order.</p>

<p>Xu Dingkang, the director of the Canal Engineering Bureau, returned to the bureau by boat from Qing yesterday. He spoke in detail about the recent progress of the Liutang River project. He said that since the project started, it has been nearly two months.

The construction in Dongtai, Guanyun, Lianshui, and Shuyang counties, where labor recruitment was difficult, has also begun in order. The general situation is on track. However, the weather is too cold, and the rivers are frozen, making the project difficult to carry out. The Qianji Dam in the upper reaches of the Liutang River has been completed, and the Longtou Dam in the lower reaches is scheduled to begin construction on the 10th of this month. The Chaimi Dam in the middle section is under construction. After the three dams are completed, dredging machines will be used to dredge the river channels in various places. It is reported that Director Xu will report the progress of the project to the province in the coming days.</p>

<p>Jin Zhengkai and his wife, residents of the Liao Family Village in Xiannvmiao, both in their fifties, had two sons. The eldest son, Jin Zhong, worked at the Hecheng Silk Shop on Duozi Street in Yangzhou. Because the Lunar New Year was approaching, the father went to Yangzhou to ask his son for money. The son, having no savings, negotiated with the shop owner and borrowed 20 yuan to take home. However, it was a drop in the bucket and not enough. The parents inevitably criticized him. Jin Zhong suddenly had suicidal thoughts. He went to the city, bought one yuan of opium, and returned home. Weeping, he told his wife, "I do not want to live in this world. Take care of yourself." Hearing this, the wife also wept and said, "I am willing to die with you." The husband and wife then swallowed the opium. At midnight, Jin Zhong's daughter suddenly cried out for her mother. The neighbor in the opposite room heard the crying and sensed something was wrong. He rushed in and saw the son and daughter-in-law lying in each other's arms. The son still had a breath. He quickly called the neighbors to give first aid with soap water. The son was saved. But the daughter-in-law had already died.</p>

<p>Song Goes to Hangzhou to Meet Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Regarding Economic Committee Plans</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, went to Hangzhou last Saturday to meet Chairman Chiang. He completed his business the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he invited Shao Lizi, the Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, to discuss the development of the Northwest. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Song and Shao Discuss Northwest Development. Shao Lizi, the Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Yesterday morning, at 10:45 AM, he visited Song Ziwen, the Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, to discuss the development of the Northwest. Shao had previously drafted a general outline of a plan for the development of the Northwest and submitted it to the National Economic Council for reference. Shao's visit to Song yesterday morning was to explain this general outline of the development plan in person and to report on the current situation in the Northwest. He left after talking for about half an hour.</p>
<p>Song Explains His Mission to Hangzhou. Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspapers inquired about Song's mission to Hangzhou in writing. Song sent Cheng Zhonghang to meet them. According to Cheng, Song's visit to Hangzhou was solely to discuss the National Economic Council's plans with Chairman Chiang. There was no other mission. The rumors that Song's visit to Hangzhou was related to financial matters are inaccurate. As for the National Economic Council's plans, it was previously decided to select two or three items for implementation from the nine items of (1) highways, (2) shipping, (3) water conservancy, (4) cotton industry, (5) silk industry, (6) agriculture, (7) health, (8) construction in the Jiangxi bandit areas, and (9) development of the Northwest. However, it is still being studied which items to choose for implementation. It is expected that the development of the Northwest will be decided for implementation. Regarding the development of the Northwest, it was decided to start with the construction of highways and the development of water conservancy. The cost is estimated to be over 10 million yuan, which will be allocated from the American cotton and wheat loan.</p>

<p>Discussed Economic Council Plans and Inheritance Tax Draft in Hangzhou. Kong first said that he went to Hangzhou to discuss the National Economic Council with Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission and Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Council. Regarding the issue of levying inheritance tax, the Ministry of Finance believes that China's social and economic situation is very different from that of European and American countries, and that this move is closely related to the interests of the people. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is determined to carefully consider this issue, ensuring that it benefits the national treasury and does not harm the people, with the principle of protecting national inheritance. The drafted tax regulations have now been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The implementation policy will be determined based on the results of the review.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Siam Restricts Overseas Chinese <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Increasing the Residence Fee to 100 Baht</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that in recent years, overseas Chinese compatriots have been subjected to abuse by local authorities in various places. The most notable example is the expulsion of Chinese in Mexico. Recently, Siam, in order to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese, has also increased the immigration residence fee. According to sources from the local overseas Chinese community, the Siamese government, to restrict immigration, promulgated immigration regulations in 1927, requiring all entrants, in addition to holding consular passports, to pay an entry continuation fee of 7.50 Tical (Siamese currency). Subsequently, in August 1931, it promulgated amended regulations, increasing the entry fee to 10 Baht, bringing the total to 15 Baht including the continuation fee. Later, it further increased the residence fee by 30 Baht, leading to a daily decrease in the number of overseas Chinese going to Siam. It is now learned that the government will further increase the immigration residence fee from 30 Baht to 100 Baht, scheduled for promulgation on March 1 and implementation on April 1. It also stipulates that entrants must be proficient in the Siamese language or their native language before being allowed to disembark. As for immigrants who leave Siam but still need to return, they must obtain a return permit before leaving the country, and the permit fee will also increase from 5 Baht to more than 20 Baht. Therefore, it is predicted that after the implementation of these measures, the number of overseas Chinese going to Siam will inevitably decrease sharply. The following is an investigation of the number of overseas Chinese entering Siam in the last five years: From 1928 to 1929, the number of entries was 880,433 and exits was 621,38. From 1929 to 1930, the number of entries was 705,52 and exits was 526,77. From 1930 to 1931, the number of entries was 763,69 and exits was 542,19. From 1931 to 1932, the number of entries was 695,49 and exits was 530,58. From 1932 to 1933, the number of entries was 138,16 and exits was 243,67.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Compatriots in the Northeast Are Still Enthusiastic About Promoting Domestic Goods <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Knitting Industry Association Relays a Letter from Northeast Carriers</p>
<p>Petitioning the Ministry of Industry to Order the Jianghai Customs to Exempt Export Taxes</p>
<p>Still Our Country's Territory, Please Do Not Treat it as a Foreign Land, The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association is petitioning the Ministry of Industry to review and exempt the export tax levied by the Customs on the four northeastern provinces. The original text is as follows: A petition is hereby submitted regarding the request. A letter from the member, China First Knitting Factory, states: We, the undersigned carriers from the Northeast, have been promoting your factory's products for many years. Since the rebellion in Liaoning, although the four northeastern provinces have fallen into the hands of rebels, our country has not relinquished sovereignty and it is still Chinese territory and should not be treated as a foreign land. However, there is something inexplicable: your factory has already been approved by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to pay the regular tax under the Machine-Made Western Goods Tax Regulations, without the need to pay export customs duties again, as is the case with Southeast Asian countries. Now, when goods are shipped to the four northeastern provinces, which our country has not relinquished, it is even worse than shipping to foreign ports in Southeast Asia, which is doubtful. Furthermore, when we ship your factory's products, in addition to paying the consolidated tax and export tax, we also have to pay a landing tax upon arrival in the Northeast. In total, the various taxes are equivalent to the price of the goods. The cost is too high, making it difficult to sell. We have the intention to promote domestic goods, but lack the means to maintain it. We ask you to find a way to remedy this, otherwise we can only lament helplessly. We dare to state this directly, hoping for good news soon. Based on this, your factory has been approved by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for special treatment in accordance with the current measures of the Machine-Made Western Goods Tax, adhering to the principle of not levying taxes twice on the same item, to show preferential treatment. All domestic goods factories are the same. The collection of landing taxes in the Northeast is due to the rebel party controlling the government, and it is impossible to correct it. However, the collection of export taxes in Shanghai seems to be an exception. It is a misunderstanding of the meaning of promoting domestic goods and violates the principle of not levying taxes twice on the same item. We hope that your association, leading the industry, has always aimed to reduce the cost of products. The Northeast is still our country's territory, please do not treat it as a foreign land. We should separately review and transfer this to exempt the Shanghai export tax, so that the future of domestic goods will be greatly benefited. Based on this, in addition to replying in a letter, we should report the situation to the Ministry of Industry and request that it review and approve it, in accordance with the special treatment of the current measures of the Machine-Made Western Goods Tax, adhering to the principle of not levying taxes twice on the same item. It should be clearly ordered to the Jianghai Customs to exempt export taxes on goods destined for the Northeast, which would be a convenient law.</p>

<p>Actively Preparing for the China-Italy Circuit. According to a report from the Central News Agency, since the International Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications first connected with the Philippines in February of the 18th year (of the Republic), in the past few years, direct circuits to all parts of the world have been completed one after another, including the Philippines, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, Macau, the United States (two lines), France, Germany, Annam, Switzerland, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Currently, the China-Italy circuit is being actively prepared for completion in the short term. As for the achievements of the Administration since the 18th year, according to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Administration: (1) The business situation from the 18th to the 22nd year was as follows: the income in the 18th year was approximately 200,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan in the 19th year, 1.75 million yuan in the 20th year, 2 million yuan in the 21st year, and 3 million yuan in the 22nd year. (2) The number of words sent was approximately 500,000 words in the 18th year, 750,000 words in the 19th year, 1.5 million words in the 20th year, 2 million words in the 21st year, and 2.25 million words in the 22nd year.

<p>The Reserve Bank Paid the Sum Yesterday</p>
<p>The Banking Sector Did Not Provide Loans, According to the Da Gong News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi borrowed a total of 2 million yuan from the Shanghai Qian industry in two separate loans, using customs treasury bonds of the 22nd year of the Republic as collateral. Because the Fujian Incident has been quelled, the war zone urgently needs post-war reconstruction, and everything requires funds. In addition to the Fujian provincial government being responsible for planning financial resources, Minister Kong sent another letter to the Qian Industry Association the day before yesterday, requesting to borrow another 750,000 yuan in tax funds, still using customs treasury bonds of the 22nd year of the Republic with a face value of 15 million yuan as collateral, to cope with the situation. After receiving the letter from the Ministry of Finance, the Qian Industry Association convened a regular meeting at the association on the 2nd of this month, attended by dozens of representatives from various member Qian shops. Chairman Qin Runqing first reported on the loan situation from the Ministry of Finance. After discussion by the member representatives, it was finally decided that the loan would be advanced by the Qian Industry Reserve Bank, and the interest earned would belong to the Reserve Bank. The meeting was then adjourned. It is learned that the Qian Industry Reserve Bank has paid the borrowed amount in full yesterday and sent it to the Ministry of Finance for collection. According to a report from the Central News Agency, there are rumors that the national treasury is depleted and that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi will borrow funds from the Shanghai banking sector. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries with the local banking sector yesterday morning, these rumors are completely inaccurate. Former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen helped Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi in early January to borrow large sums of money from the local banking sector. The lenders were a syndicate of more than ten major banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The funds have been gradually deposited into the treasury. After this loan is completed, the Ministry of Finance will not borrow funds from the banking sector again before June of this year. As for the 10 million yuan of customs treasury bonds of the 23rd year of the Republic, they have been deposited in the Central Bank treasury to offset previous debts.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Sent a Letter to the Guowen News Agency, The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, in order to study and resolve the water dispute within the settlement, has specially established the Municipal Council Water Price Research Committee, appointing Feng Bingnan, who previously mediated the dispute, Mei Jiufu, Director of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council, and Kanna, Manager of Mobil Oil Company, as members. To solicit opinions from all parties as much as possible, it has specifically scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month, inviting the chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Association and the president of the Western Property Owners Association to attend, explain their opinions, and facilitate implementation. The letters from the Municipal Council Water Price Research Committee to the chairman of the Real Estate Association and the president of the Western Property Owners Association are recorded below: Sir, At the last meeting of this committee, the members, in order to solicit opinions from all parties as much as possible, requested your chairman (your president) to explain your association's views on the currently implemented water meter rates, which is a necessary move. We hereby invite your chairman (your president) to attend the next meeting of this committee, scheduled for 3:00 PM on February 8, at the office of the Director of Finance of the Municipal Council. We hope that you will arrive on time. Attached is a copy of the gazette of January 19, which contains the organization and responsibilities of this committee for your reference. It is also heard that the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company has also been invited to attend.</p>
<p>Association Notice</p>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, under the name of the Shanghai Real Estate Association, has printed and distributed the following notice to various property owners. The text is as follows: (Shanghai Real Estate Association Notice) Property owners with excessively high water bills are advised by this association to adopt the following methods: (1) Please ask the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company to send personnel to inspect and report on the situation of the property, and ask the company to formulate a plan to reduce water consumption. (Note) When requesting, the number of the water bill and the location of the property must be stated. (2) Based on the reduction plan formulated by the company, repair any damaged water pipes immediately. If tenants in the property have a large amount of non-household water consumption (such as factories, restaurants, old-fashioned stoves, and other small businesses), please ask the company to install auxiliary water meters at the tenant's location. (Note) Special attention should be paid to the fact that the water company will select several locations for free installation of these auxiliary water meters. (3) Please ask the water company to provide printed notices to warn tenants not to waste and abuse the supplied water. (Note) These notices should be applied to the house. (4) Property owners should consider whether it is appropriate to install separate water meters for each tenant. After the installation of separate water meters for each tenant, the water company will directly enter into contracts with each user and collect water fees. (Note) If you want to install separate water meters for each tenant, the cost of all necessary changes to the water pipes should be borne by the property owner, and the property owner should also pay a cash deposit sufficient to cover the value of the water meter. The amount of this deposit has recently been reduced. A half-inch (1/2") water meter now costs only 47 yuan, and a three-eighths inch (3/8") water meter costs 33 yuan. If you want to know the total amount of the deposit required for each property, you can inquire with the water company, which will be happy to inform you. For trial purposes, the company has tried a new method of meter installation, which can greatly reduce the cost of changing water pipes. Although there may be a loss of interest on the water meter deposit, it is very small compared to the water bill savings after installing meters in places with excessive water bills. Please note that this deposit will be refunded when the property is transferred or the water meter is removed. (In addition, there are several drawings and descriptions (auxiliary water meters) of the differences between (separate household water meters) and new meter installation methods, (omitted).</p>

<p>Discussing Rent Reduction and Water Bill Issues, According to Xin Sheng News Agency, since the First Special District Citizens' Federation联合会联合各团体组织组建减低房租委员会 (Joint Committee to Reduce Rents) organized by the First Special District Citizens' Federation and other groups launched a rent reduction campaign, the Shanghai Real Estate Association specially convened a general meeting of members at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss water bill issues.</p>

<p>As a result of the meeting, Kui Yanfang was publicly elected as chairman to report on the letter from the Municipal Council Water Price Research Committee inviting them to attend the next meeting, and the rent reduction proposal was completed. Then, discussions began. As a result, no public statement was made. However, according to the reporter's inquiries from another source, the content of the discussion focused on the rent reduction issue. It was decided to notify the member property owners to stop new construction in the near future. Regarding the water bill issue, because the water company has not yet obtained a fair solution, it was decided to send representatives to participate in the water price research meeting on February 8 and strive for the principle of equal water bills, so that property owners and tenants will not clash head-on.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Derailment of a Freight Train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Was Fully Repaired Yesterday Morning <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The 321st down-train freight train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway derailed at Benniu Station at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, causing the locomotive and four freight cars to overturn. The railway's traffic and engineering departments successively dispatched rescue trains from Shanghai and Changzhou to rush to repair the damage. At 7:00 PM that evening, temporary tracks were first laid to facilitate traffic. At the same time, the derailed freight cars were lifted and the track timbers were repaired. The work was completed at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, restoring the original condition.</p>
<p>Fully Repaired Because the derailed freight cars on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway were fully loaded with goods and difficult to lift, temporary tracks were rushed to completion at 7:06 PM that evening, allowing all trains to pass without obstruction. At the same time, coolies were ordered to unload the goods from each car before lifting the cars and dragging them away from the scene of the accident. The sleepers and steel rails were rushed to repair, and the entire project was completed at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, restoring the original condition. All trains arrived at their destinations on time.</p>
<p>Consulting on Aftermath The Traffic Department and Engineering Department of the railway dispatched responsible persons and engineers to the scene of the accident for investigation and rescue after the accident. Although the tracks have been repaired, in order to investigate the cause of the accident and its responsibility, a meeting was held at Benniu Station at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Those present included Yuan Shaochang, Deputy Director of the Traffic Department; Chen Chengshi, Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai Main Section; Xu Chaoyuan, Deputy Section Chief; Lü Weiyan, Chief of the Dan-Su Sub-Section; Tang Huanfu, Chief of the Resident Section; Huai Haoshide, Director of the Engineering Department; Zhong En, Deputy Director of the Locomotive Department; Feng Qili, Chief Engineer of Shanghai Station; and the stationmaster at the scene of the accident and his responsible personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Dada Company's Jiangjing Steamer Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Passengers Secretly Carried Explosives That Evaporated and Exploded</p>
<p>Wounding Two Crew Members and Five Passengers</p>
<p>One Person's Limbs Were Severed, Three Were Blinded, The Jiangjing Steamer, rented by the Dada Shipping Company from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sailing the Tongyang route. On the 3rd of this month, it departed from Shanghai to Tongyang. When it arrived above Xinsheng Port, passengers on board secretly carried explosives and sulfur, which suddenly exploded. Two crew members and five passengers were wounded on the spot, and part of the ship's cabin was also damaged. The passengers who caused the accident have been detained and sent to the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The Jiangjing returned to Shanghai yesterday. The situation investigated by this newspaper's reporter is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Equipment Inside the Ship Is Complete Since the Great Auspicious disaster two years ago, in which the Dagil was loaded with saltpeter, causing a huge explosion, the Dada Shipping Company's Tongyang-bound ships have been very thorough in their arrangement of fire-fighting equipment inside the ship. They do not load dangerous goods or explosives. Also, fearing that passengers may secretly transport prohibited items, and for the safety of the voyage, the company has also consulted with the water police to accompany the ship and inspect along the way. All matters related to eliminating crises are actively carried out, and the fire prevention and inspection of the Jiangjing is even more strictly enforced. Unexpectedly, there was still an explosion caused by secretly carried explosives and saltpeter.</p>
<p>Passengers Secretly Carried Explosives The Jiangjing Steamer departed from Shanghai at around 2:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. There were not many goods leaving Shanghai, but there were more than 400 passengers, and more luggage than usual. When the ship left Shanghai, several passengers, including Cai Yunsheng, Zou Caigao, and Zhang Yucun, each carried objects in mesh baskets. When boarding the ship, they were received by the tea boy and stayed in the cabin on the platform deck in the front cargo hold. Initially, it was not expected that the mesh baskets secretly carried dangerous goods such as explosives and saltpeter.</p>
<p>Sudden Explosion En Route At around 6:00 PM, when the ship arrived in the middle of Xinsheng Port and Xin Port, the ship served dinner and prepared for bed. The explosives and saltpeter in the mesh baskets on the upper layer of the front cargo hold suddenly exploded due to heat evaporation. With a loud bang, the entire ship shook. After the explosion, flames immediately rose, and the smell of saltpeter filled the entire ship. All cabins were shrouded in smoke.</p>
<p>Passengers Panicked Suddenly hearing the smell of smoke, the passengers suspected that the boiler in the engine room had exploded, believing that a great disaster was about to happen. More than 400 passengers rushed out of the cabin, scurrying towards the bow and stern of the ship, hoping to escape. The order was disrupted as a result. Some passengers, seeing smoke rising from the head cabin, jumped into the river and swam away. The ship was on the verge of capsizing due to the passengers running to one side. Fortunately, the shipowner and crew made every effort to explain and persuade, so the situation was turned around.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Cause of the Accident Was Ascertained While the shipowner was appeasing the passengers, he ordered all the crew and sailors to use the fire-fighting equipment on board and make every effort to extinguish the smoke and fire in the head cabin. After an hour, the remaining fire was extinguished. Someone was sent to thoroughly investigate the truth of the accident. The watchman, Chen Fusheng, witnessed the explosion in the cabin on the second floor of the head cabin. Cai Yunsheng, Zou Caigao, Zhang Yucun, and others were carrying mesh baskets. The watchman pointed out that the three were the ones who secretly carried explosives. Another passenger named Liu Guangcheng also secretly carried saltpeter. The crew put the four of them under guard. A Total of Seven People Were Injured</p>
<p>The explosion occurred in the rear section of the second floor of the head cabin. Those injured in the explosion were: Liu Guangcheng, 38 years old, from Funing, injured in the face, residing at Shunde Lane, Hartung Road, Shanghai, a pastor at the Jesus Church; (2) Li Amei, 14 years old, from Yangzhou, injured in the head and left hand and foot, almost severed, working in a yarn factory in Shanghai; (3) Zhou Changluo, 29 years old, from Yangzhou, injured in the face, a deckhand on the ship; (4) Liu Yinchun, from Xin Port, injured in both feet; (5) Wang Yungen, 32 years old, from Yangzhou, a shoemaker, injured in the face; (6) Qian Bingheng, from Zhenjiang, 40 years old, a freight accountant on the Jiangjing, injured in the face; (7) Shen Huanzuo, from Wuxi, 24 years old, a ticket inspector on the ship, injured in the face.</p>
<p>Sent to the Jiangyin Hospital and Bureau After the accident, the ship immediately sailed to Jiangyin and reported to the Public Security Bureau. Director Hua sent patrol officer Wu Guoan to thoroughly investigate the ship. The perpetrators, Cai Yunsheng (from Wuling), Zou Caigao (from Yancheng),</p>
<p>Zhang Yucun, Liu Guangcheng, and others were taken to the bureau. A business card and certificate from Wang Zemin, a saltpeter salesman in the Shangbao District, were found on each person. The Public Security Bureau, considering that the matter concerned the secret carrying of prohibited items and caused a major disaster, immediately transferred them to the Jiangyin County Government for interrogation. As for the seven injured people, they were also transferred to the Northeast Gate Gospel Hospital for treatment. It is said that Li Amei was the most seriously injured, with his limbs severed. The other three who were injured in the face were blinded in both eyes and could not be treated, and will be disabled. The Shipowner's Original Telegram The shipowner sent a telegram to Shanghai to report to the Dada Company, Jiangjing was between Xinsheng Port and Xin Port at youke evening. In the front cargo hold, there was a sudden explosion, the smell of sulfur, the fire and smoke were everywhere, and the order was in chaos. The ship was almost overturned. Fortunately, it was rescued immediately and extinguished immediately. The fire chief Qian and the inspector Shen were injured, as well as four others, and sent to Jiangyin Hospital. The perpetrator of the explosives was sent to the Public Security Bureau and interrogated by the county. There was slight damage to the goods. When the telegram arrived, it was a Sunday, and no one was working, so it was not forwarded to the China Merchants Bureau until yesterday morning, and the bureau forwarded it to the insurance company for reference.</p>
<p>Slight Damage to the Ship's Hull Returned to Shanghai, The ship has returned to Shanghai via Yangzhou and Tongzhou, arriving at the port at 3:00 PM and docking at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. The explosion destroyed six passenger seats on the second floor of the front cabin, and the ship's hull was slightly damaged. All the explosive mesh baskets were destroyed, but the empty shells of the firecrackers were brought to Shanghai by the shipowner for the company to view. The damage to the front cabin was reported to the China Merchants Bureau, which sent carpenters and workers to repair it. The ship will operate as usual today.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai-Hankou Through Train Service Commenced Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>First Train from Hankou Will Arrive in Shanghai on the Evening of the 7th</p>
<p>Train from Shanghai Will Arrive in Hankou on the Morning of the 8th</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou through train service commenced yesterday, with one train running daily in each direction between Shanghai and Hankou. The Shanghai-Xuzhou section will temporarily use the Shanghai-Beijing through train. The journey will take approximately 50 hours. First, second, and third-class sleeper tickets are available. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Commencement of Through Train Service The Shanghai-Hankou through train service was implemented yesterday after the Nanjing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Longhai, and Beijing-Hankou railways completed their preparations. Train No. 302, the Shanghai-Beijing through train, departs from Shanghai North Station at 12:00 PM. Passenger Train No. 2 departs from Dazhimen, Hankou, at 10:30 PM. The Shanghai-Xuzhou section of the train from Shanghai to Hankou temporarily uses the Shanghai-Beijing through train. After arriving in Xuzhou, the Longhai Railway will have one first/second-class passenger/sleeper mixed car and one third-class car attached to Passenger Train No. 1 to Zhengzhou, and then transfer to Hankou. The train from Hankou to Shanghai will have Passenger Train No. 2 attached to the Beijing-Hankou Railway to Zhengzhou, then Passenger Train No. 2 attached to the Longhai Railway to Xuzhou, and then transfer to Train No. 301, the Shanghai-Beijing through train, on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Train Schedule The train schedule for the Shanghai-Hankou through train is as follows: (1) From Hankou to Shanghai on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, departing from Dazhimen, Hankou, at 10:30 PM, arriving in Zhengzhou at 4:30 PM the next day. The Longhai Railway departs from Zhengzhou at 7:00 PM, arriving in Xuzhou at 5:15 AM the next day.

<h3 id="e125">Iron Department Limits Payment Methods for Intermodal Transport of Goods <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Should be limited to payment in advance or on arrival according to regulations</p>
<p>It is not permissible for each railway to collect separately, hindering progress. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways stating: "According to the intermodal transport report, the original principle for payment methods for responsible intermodal transport of goods by railways was limited to two types: payment in advance or payment on arrival. However, the intermodal transport handled by the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, as well as the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, sometimes uses a payment method of one ticket with two types of payment (i.e., payment in advance at the departure station and payment on arrival at the destination station), which is not convenient for merchants and hinders the promotion of intermodal transport. It is proposed to order the cancellation of this method."</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the payment method for intermodal transport of goods, as stipulated in the "Provisional Measures for Responsible Intermodal Transport of Goods by Railways" promulgated by the Ministry, was originally limited to payment in advance or payment on arrival. If these railways continue to follow old practices and each railway collects its own fees, it may appear to be intermodal transport on the surface, but in reality, it is simply the transfer of vehicles from one track to another. This not only contradicts the intermodal transport regulations but also greatly hinders the promotion of intermodal transport. Since the restoration of responsible intermodal transport of goods by railways, this payment method has no room for existence. If all railways involved in intermodal transport only focus on absorbing current cash flow, disregarding the regulations promulgated by the Ministry and the interests of merchants, the result will inevitably affect the national intermodal transport industry.</p>
<p>To prevent problems before they arise, it is hereby ordered that all relevant railways comply with the following: henceforth, for all payment methods at each station for intermodal transport, payment shall uniformly be limited to payment in advance or on arrival according to regulations. It is not permissible to adhere to old practices and have each railway collect its own fees, which would hinder the convenience of merchants and the promotion of intermodal transport. In addition to separately ordering all intermodal transport railway bureaus to comply, you are hereby ordered to strictly comply with and implement this order." The bureau has already instructed the transportation department to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e126">In the Midst of Calls for Relief for Native Sugar, Qinzhou-Lianzhou Native Sugar is Confiscated Again <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Pang Songhui petitions in Beijing again. Pang Songhui, a representative of sugar merchants from Qinzhou and Lianzhou, was entrusted by the chambers of commerce of various counties in Qinzhou and Lianzhou and the Guangyi Hall of the sugar industry to petition in Beijing because the Jianghai Customs repeatedly detained and fined native sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou being transported to Shanghai last year. This matter has been reported in various newspapers. Representative Pang previously arrived in Shanghai and appealed for assistance from the National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations. He also petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Customs Administration in Beijing, presenting four relief measures, which were all adopted. Sugar farmers and merchants who had been forced out of work for several months resumed their businesses this year because the government promised to protect them. However, the Jianghai Customs' sugar inspection has not only failed to correct its errors but has actually intensified them.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of last month, Henghelong, a Qinzhou-Lianzhou sugar merchant, transported 92 packages of native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai on the Hubei steamer, which was received by Futian Foreign Firm. When exporting, the Beihai Customs verified that the sugar was produced by the Lunchang Sugar Workshop in Wuli Market, Lingshan County, and was indeed a pure native product. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs re-examined it and unexpectedly claimed that it contained more than half foreign sugar and confiscated the entire shipment.</p>
<p>Representative Pang returned to Shanghai from Beijing upon hearing the news and rushed to the Jianghai Customs to question the Deputy Commissioner of Customs. It was claimed that the sugar had a specific rotation of 92.8 degrees, which proved that it contained more than half foreign sugar. Representative Pang argued that the Central Industrial Testing Laboratory was ordered last month to test native sugar from Qiongzhou, and type C had a specific rotation of 92 degrees, while type B reached 93 degrees. Native sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou has always been better than that from Qiongzhou. Now that the sugar has been tested and has not reached 93 degrees, how can it be said that it contains foreign sugar? He requested that it be retained for public re-examination.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Representative Pang, accompanied by Zheng Zenan, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to report the matter. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Secretary Yan E, and others were shocked upon hearing the news. They all believed that the Jianghai Customs' actions would not stop until native sugar was completely destroyed and unanimously agreed to forward the matter to the central government for urgent relief measures. It is reported that Representative Pang will again go to the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, the National Tariff Commission, the National Federation of Commerce, the Guangdong Fellow Association, and other organizations to appeal for relief and assistance, and then petition in Beijing again.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Bureau of International Trade Announces Reasons for Failure of Chinese Goods Sales in New Zealand <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Silk and tea urgently need improvement. Yesterday, He Bingxian, Director of the Bureau of International Trade, and Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department, discussed the trade situation between China and New Zealand and the reasons for its failure. The main Chinese goods sold in New Zealand are hardware, dried fruit, silk, cloth, and the like. The value of goods imported last year (1932) was 82,115 New Zealand pounds, a decrease of more than 2,600 pounds compared to the import volume in 1931 and a decrease of more than 54,500 pounds compared to the import volume in 1928.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for this is the global economic recession. In the past two or three years, unemployment in New Zealand has been very high, and purchasing power has been greatly weakened. Goods from all countries shipped to New Zealand have been affected. However, some Chinese goods have lost market share due to competition. Taking tea and silk as examples, they were originally unique products of China, and China originally monopolized the New Zealand market. In recent years, due to competition from tea and silk from other countries, the import of Chinese tea and silk has decreased sharply and declined year by year. The tea and silk market that once belonged to us has been seized by Indian, Ceylonese tea, English and Japanese silk.</p>
<p>The reasons for the failure, taking tea as an example, are: first, the packaging is poor and traditional methods are adhered to. China and New Zealand are far apart, and there is a tropical zone in between. Most tea is still packaged in paper. By the time it arrives in New Zealand, the tea flavor has dissipated. Second, the credit of Chinese merchants is not stable. The samples sent do not match the goods, and the samples are often very good, while the goods are extremely poor, losing the trust of New Zealand merchants. Third, New Zealand imposes preferential tariffs on imports of British products, and Chinese tea is subject to higher taxes, resulting in slightly higher costs and higher prices, leading to its defeat by Indian and Ceylonese tea.</p>
<p>Taking silk as an example, the color dyeing of Chinese silk is not top-notch, and the material is strong and thick, but the price is too expensive, making it difficult to compete with cheap Japanese silk. Silk fabrics are used to make women's fashion, and the patterns and styles are changing with each passing day. Therefore, although Chinese silk is durable, it is not valued. Since 1928, the value of Chinese goods sold in New Zealand has gradually declined. The reason for this is the global economic recession. It is hoped that the import of Chinese goods will increase when the world becomes prosperous. However, if goods such as tea and silk have lost market share due to competition, if we do not improve our shortcomings, how can we compete with others and how can we restore the old rules?</p>
<h3 id="e128">Crackdown on Unlicensed Seafarers Extended to the End of June <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>All must apply for inspection according to law within the time limit. According to New Voice News Agency, since the Ministry of Transportation promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Seafarer Inspection", it has held seafarer examinations twice and has cracked down on the continued employment of unlicensed seafarers who have not applied for inspection. This order was originally scheduled to take effect on November 30 of last year. Now, the Ministry of Transportation, considering that there are a large number of people who have not been inspected and that some seafarers have been unable to participate in the examination due to business reasons and sailing with ships, issued an order on the 3rd of this month to all navigation administration bureaus, wheel mechanic driving associations, etc., to extend the crackdown on unlicensed seafarers to June 30 of this year. It is also stipulated that all must apply for inspection according to law within this period. If they still wait and see, they will be subject to crackdown at that time. The "Provisional Regulations for Seafarer Inspection" have also been revised (the original text is very long, omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e129">Jianghai Customs Issues Two Notices <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>New weights and measures must indicate the conversion number of old weights and measures.</p>
<p>Add items to the import manifest.</p>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs, in order to implement the new system of weights and measures, temporarily requires indicating the conversion number of the old system of weights and measures, and adding items to the import manifest, issued notices No. 28 and 29 yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Notice 1: The new system of weights and measures is scheduled to be implemented on February 1 of this year. This Customs has already issued announcement No. 1328. Within three weeks from the date of implementation of the new system of weights and measures, the new system of weights and measures and the conversion number according to the old system of weights and measures must be indicated separately. All merchants, etc., are requested to comply. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Notice 2: The matter of submitting inspection forms for ships entering port according to the rules for a trial period was announced by this Customs on March 20 of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Hereafter, one of the following items must be filled in on all import manifests submitted to the Customs: (1) Packing list attached; (2) There is no package on board. All circumstances of the package carried should be listed in the packing list and must be signed by the shipowner of the ship taken for verification. All shipping merchants, etc., are requested to comply. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Ministry of Transportation Stipulates Routes for Transmitting Official Public Telegrams <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Divide wireless stations into four routes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Radio Station was ordered to comply with the matter of transmitting official public telegrams. The Municipal Radio Station received an order from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday stating: "In order to comply with the matter, although there are special designated routes for transmitting official public telegrams to various stations, the sending station often has not been registered. By the time it reaches other places, the relay station adds the registration, so that one telegram is often received from several places and forwarded repeatedly, which not only consumes electricity and materials, but also clogs the circuit. The wireless stations under the Ministry are now divided into four routes for receiving and relaying such official public telegrams: Wuhu, Ningbo, Chongming, Nanjing, Dinghai, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Qidong, and other ten places are the first route; Nanchang, Yichang, Shashi, Changsha, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and other six places are the second route; Weihaiwei, Qingdao, Beiping, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Dihua, Yantai, Jinan, and other eight places are the third route; Xuzhou, Wanxian, Chengdu, Guiyang, Yunnan, and other five places are the fourth route. Any radio station in any route that receives an official public telegram should, in addition to sending it to the designated Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Chongqing radio stations within the route, not forward it on its own. Those that cannot be directly sent should be handed over in succession for other stations to forward to the designated relay station. After receiving the telegram, they should send it according to the route to avoid omissions. This will be implemented from March 1. You are hereby ordered to comply."</p>

<p>The China International Trade Association held a board meeting at the Bank Club yesterday. Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Jiqing, Zou Bingwen, Lin Kanghou, Ren Sida, Guo Bingwen, and others attended. In addition to reporting on the progress of work and economic conditions, the following resolutions were also made: (1) Regarding the representative attending the Paris International Trade Conference, it was agreed to support the proposal of the Consulate General in Paris to have two overseas Chinese businessmen in France, Lu Qinzhai and Ma Shoubai, participate as representatives. Regarding the association's request for our country to reduce import duties on French goods and export duties on our country's important export products, and to protect trademark rights, opinions were listed according to the facts, and the French side was also requested to apply the lowest tax rate to our country's major exports to France based on the principle of reciprocity. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce will reply to the International Trade Bureau and forward it to the Ministry of Industry for review and handling. (2) The Russian Cooperation Association requested financial convenience for the transportation of Chinese tea to Russia. It was agreed to jointly submit the matter to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review and handling together with the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.

<h3 id="e132">Rent Increase Wave in Fansheng Lane, Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Tenants form rent reduction branch to cope. The houses in Fansheng Lane, at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Dongxi Huade Road in Hongkou, are the property of Han Ronggen and are leased by the British company, Teli &amp; Co. On the 17th of last month, the company suddenly appointed lawyer Chen Zhongyin to notify each tenant in writing that the rent would be increased by 30% from January. If they do not pay the increased amount in full, they will be ordered to pay off the old rent owed by the end of this month and move out. The tenants believe that the rent in this lane was increased by 20% in 1925. The landlord is taking advantage of the current economic downturn and commercial decline to implement high pressure by relying on the power of foreigners, which is hateful.

<p>Shanghai's people's spirit is declining</p>
<p>The market will be monopolized. Building materials. Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper, Mainichi Shimbun, reported that the economic circles of this port are in a state of extreme depression, but the construction industry is the opposite. Recently, new-style building materials from Japan have been greatly welcomed locally. Japanese building materials have leaped forward dramatically since the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923. Today, various building materials are not inferior to those of Europe and the United States, and they are welcomed by builders because of their low prices. Recently, the number of various new-style materials imported from Japan has increased greatly. In addition, the freight is low and the delivery date is short, so they are much more profitable than European and American products, so the future is very promising.</p>
<p>Competition in dyes. On the 4th, the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily reported that Japanese goods have been able to overcome the barrier of high tariffs and enter various countries, which has surprised various countries. For example, German dyes, which overwhelmed the world market in the past, are now gradually declining, and the territory of British and American goods has been overwhelmed by Japanese goods in recent years. Last year, Japanese dyes accounted for the fifth place in China's imports. Now, due to price competition, the demand is expanding.</p>

<p>Shen Yunpu, platoon leader of the Xiaozha sub-defense of the Caoxi District Security Corps in Shanghai West, led squad leader Zhou Fugen and others on patrol outside last night at about 11 o'clock, when they caught sight of two people carrying cloth bags and walking in a panic at the intersection of Zhongshan Road. They immediately went forward to carry out an inspection. When the two people saw this, they abandoned their bags and fled, but were intercepted by the team members. The abandoned bags were picked up and inspected, and all of them were found to be fake silver coins, totaling more than 606 coins. They were brought back to the sub-defense for questioning. According to the confession, one was Cao Heshang, 36 years old, from Tongzhou, and the other was Yu Fengqi, 28 years old, from Haimen. The fake coins were manufactured at the home of Li Haigen, a local, at No. 3 Lijiazhai. After Shen Paichang was reported, he immediately sent team members to take the two criminals, Yu and Cao, to search the house. Only fake silver dollars, a package of lead cakes, three dry batteries, a package of lead powder, and five gypsum molds were found. Four people from Haimen who manufactured lead coins, Wang Deshun, Zhou Shaolong, Lu Qiuyang, and Lu Qiuming, were arrested on the spot and sent to the regiment headquarters. After a brief interrogation by the regiment leader Yang, the criminals confessed to manufacturing lead coins. The six people who were arrested and the lead coin objects were transferred to the 3rd Section of the 6th District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and forwarded to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Xu Jinqing, 19 years old, from Chang'an, came to Shanghai with his wife on January 23 to look for a job, temporarily staying in Room 96 of the Southeast Hotel in Taiyuanfang No. 8, Eddoya Road. Two weeks ago, he asked a friend to recommend him for a job, but it has not been successful so far. More than 70 yuan of the 120 yuan he brought with him was scammed by his friend. Therefore, Jinqing was extremely depressed and suddenly had the idea of ​​ending his life. Suddenly, last night, he went to the Faxing Hotel on Baliqiao Road in the French Concession alone to open Room 11. At that time, he paid 50 cents for the room and went to bed after closing the door. At about 11 o'clock yesterday morning, the tea room saw that the guest in the room had not gotten up yet, so he was quite suspicious. He tried to pry open the door and saw Xu lying on his back on the bed with a pale face and groaning. He knew that he had taken poison, and there was still a little opium left on the table that had not been swallowed. He immediately reported to the accounting room and forwarded the report to the police. Police officer No. 114 was sent to investigate and the poisoned person was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because he was deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective. He died at about 2 pm and was transferred to the post-mortem examination for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Fourth District Escorts a Robbery Case Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Two pistols and eighty bullets</p>
<p>One principal offender and five suspected offenders. The Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei has recently solved many robbery cases. In addition to having successively submitted them to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai District Court, they escorted another case yesterday. It is learned that this case was reported by the patrol police Zhong Zhong, according to the informant Fang Zhongshu, who reported that the home of Zhu Jinzhang, a robber who robbed the Baocheng Yarn Factory, had two pistols and a box cannon hidden. Zhu is now hiding in the attic of No. 几, Zudeli, Binlang Road. The police officer immediately reported to District Chief Lai, and sent patrol officer Peng Wenwei, led by police chief Sun Kezhi, police officers Zhong Zhong, Li Deshan, Yu Changle, etc., to the address. Together with the detective team in charge, they went to the attic of No. 9 Zudeli and arrested Zhu Jinzhang, seizing two six-inch Browning pistols, numbers 404347 and 404220, as well as eighty bullets and three magazines. Twenty pawn tickets were also seized. Five suspects, Zhou Chengzhi, Liu Naigong, Li Shixun, Jia Guixuan, and Cui Ruizhi, were also arrested downstairs. After being brought back, Zhu Jinzhang confessed that he was 28 years old and from Yancheng. He had not robbed in the Chinese Concession. The robbers Wang Songting, Tang Laoshi Zi, Xiao Sanzi, and Jin Da had robbed the Bin Cheng Yarn Factory in the Concession, obtaining 1,740 yuan in silver and two pistols. Fang Zhongshu bought them on behalf of Qin Yuqing and sent them to me. Wang Songting and others have disappeared, but Qin Yuqing lives on a boat at Dayang Bridge, but I don't know where she is now. Fang Zhongshu lives at No. 7, Zhudetongli, Binlang Road. Zhou Chengqia and the other five people are all living together and have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhou Chengzhi, 35 years old, from Anhui, Liu Naigong, 22 years old, Yu Tongqing, Li Shixun, 36 years old, Jia Guixuan, 24 years old (both from Hebei), and Cui Ruizhi, 36 years old, all confessed that they were living together and did not admit that they were companions with Zhu Jinzhang. After reviewing the confession, the interrogator ordered that Wang Songting, Tang Laoshi Zi, Xiao Sanzi, and Jin Da be arrested in addition to the case, and that the six criminals, Zhu Jinzhang, the suspected criminals, Zhu Songting, etc., along with two pistols, eighty bullets, and twenty pawn tickets, be escorted to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Extortion Case to be Pronounced <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Chen Hesong, a native of Ningbo, 39 years old, who runs the Maolin Hardware and Sail Shop at No. 1002 Dongbai Laohui Road, returned to Ningbo by boat on January 27 due to some matters. First, at 3 pm, he took his own car to the home of his father-in-law, Xin Zihuai (mistakenly reported as his friend Shen Zihuai), at No. 8 Ningfuli, Gelock Road, French Concession, to say goodbye. Xin happened to be out. Chen was talking with his mother-in-law, Xin Jiangshi, for about three minutes when Hu Quanhai, a fellow villager he knew who lived at No. 7 Huabao Fang, Huanghe Road, led his accomplices, three people claiming to be special detectives surnamed Jiang and Wang, rushed in and claimed to be searching for red pills. On the bed in the room behind the sitting room where Chen was sitting, they found a pistol and handcuffs and threatened and extorted Chen. As a result, Hu and others pointed out Bao Songqing (50 years old this year, previously worked at the Gold Exchange), a fellow villager living at No. 5 Yong'anli, Baishang Road, and ordered Xin's wife, Jiangshi, to invite Bao to come, extorting 700 yuan. Jiang escorted Chen to Ningbo on the Xinjiangtian wheel. Later, after Chen returned to Shanghai, he was dissatisfied with Bao's collusion and reported it to the French Police. Detectives were sent to arrest Hu and others, but they had all fled. Only Bao was arrested and sent to the Second Special Zone Court for interrogation and investigation. All the details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Wang Gangxu continued the trial in the Criminal Court 1. First, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer for the police station, stated the police station's investigation process. Then, the plaintiff Chen Hesong recounted the experience of being defrauded and said that Bao and a man surnamed Wang had secretly whispered outside the door twice, which was obviously collusion. He now seeks to recover the defrauded money from Bao.</p>
<p>Bao Songqing confessed that he was at home that day when Xin Jiangshi, that is, Lao Erlian, came twice to ask me to intercede. I could not refuse because of the friendship with my fellow villager, so I went to mediate. I only nodded and recognized a man surnamed Wang, and I didn't know the man surnamed Jiang. Wang said that Jiang was a special detective and that Chen Hesong had a hundred guns and bullets to take back for the security corps. They were found and were going to be taken to the police station. They wanted me to intercede. I only said to give 200 yuan, but they didn't agree. Later, Chen himself agreed to give 700 yuan. Then Chen and Jiang went to get the money. When they came back, they put it on the table. I didn't touch it. Later, because Chen was carrying guns and bullets, he was afraid of inconvenience on the road, so he asked Jiang to accompany him to the ship. I went home and there was no collusion.</p>
<p>Xin Jiangshi, the witness, testified that at first she saw a big man with handcuffs in his hand, and also saw a bag, but didn't know what it was. Hu Quanhai ordered me to invite Bao Songqing to mediate. After the court verified the confession, it ordered the debate to begin, then announced the end of the session, and scheduled the sentence to be pronounced on the 9th. The defendant was ordered to submit a 2,000 yuan store bond to await the verdict.</p>

<p>Xu Weihao, a native of Shaoxing, resides at No. 28, Dade Lane, Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou (i.e., Lane 661). He married a woman surnamed Wu, who is 23 years old. However, this woman did not adhere to wifely virtues and secretly became acquainted with a local rogue named Sun Lao Si (18 years old). Xu discovered this not long after, severely reprimanded his wife, and forbade her from freely entering or leaving the house. Consequently, the woman and Sun lost contact. However, Sun Lao Si acted boldly and recklessly, directly negotiating with Xu. Xu was extremely angry and naturally had a major conflict with him. Unexpectedly, last night, Sun Lao Si suddenly gathered rogue elements, including Wu Baogen from Taizhou and Chen Along from Ningbo, three in total. They went to Xu's house and tricked Xu Weihao into going to Ru Xin Lane, Wuhua Road, Zhabei, near the Fozibao Bridge. Sun Lao Si first pulled out a pistol, intending to shoot Xu to death, but the bullet did not fire. At that moment, Chen Along, who was standing nearby, fearing that Xu would escape, fired a shot at Xu's lower body. The bullet penetrated Xu's buttocks, and he immediately fainted and fell to the ground. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the three culprits fled in different directions. Fortunately, the police officers from the Fifth District, Third Precinct, who heard the gunshot, arrived at the scene and rushed Xu to the hospital for treatment. They are currently pursuing the culprits. It is reported that Xu's injuries are not life-threatening.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Opium Products Discovered in a Mounting and Framing Shop <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>To be verified and prosecuted after examination. The police received a report letter on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, stating that someone was secretly manufacturing red pills at the Xia Guang Ge Mounting and Framing Shop at No. 121, Yin Yu Lane, Ma Gao Bao Lu Road. The police chief immediately dispatched detective Zhang Fengming to search the premises. In the dressing table drawer in the room of a Ningbo woman named Liu Cai (37 years old) on the third floor, they found two packages of morphine, weighing half a pound, a bottle of ammonia water, two bottles of coca essence, two nickel whistles, and over 170 yuan in cash. They took her to the police station for questioning. According to her statement, these items were sent to her two days ago by a friend named Hou Wenyuan, who lives at No. 22, Yong Yu Lane, Beile Road. She claimed she did not know they were drugs. The detectives then took her to Hou's house in Yongyu City for questioning. Hou happened to be out, and when Hou's wife saw the detectives from the police station arriving, she seemed guilty and escaped from the building via the drying platform on the roof. Consequently, Cai was taken back to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wang interrogated her. The police lawyer, Yao Zhao Di, presented the case and, according to the anti-smoking law, filed a lawsuit, requesting a postponement for further investigation and questioning. The drugs were presented as evidence. Subsequently, the detective in charge reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant and the search. When Liu Cai was questioned, her statement was the same as the one she gave at the police station. She hired lawyer Xiang Xun to defend her and requested bail. The court stated that the nature of the seized drugs could only be determined after they had been tested. Therefore, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning on the 12th, after the results of the examination were available. The defendant was ordered to provide a bond of 800 yuan for release pending further instructions.</p>

<p>The New New Company Believes it was Premeditated</p>
<p>The First Special Court Takes Testimony from Witnesses. Li Minzhou, the general manager of the New New Company, was shot and killed by Zhou Zhanyuan, the head of the store's security team, a native of Tianjin, in room 327 of the New New Hotel at 5:15 p.m. on the 1st of this month. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, this case was continued in the First Criminal Court by Judge Feng Shide. Li Minzhou's family and lawyer Ting Lian Ting Rui were present in court. The defendant also hired two lawyers, Wei and Tan, to defend him. Lawyer Chen began by stating that the police's indictment of the defendant on charges of premeditated murder was quite appropriate. The New New Company is currently collecting evidence to prove that Zhou Zhanyuan's crime was premeditated. However, due to being busy with funeral arrangements for the past few days, they have not been able to complete the collection of evidence. He requested permission for a postponement. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, continued by stating that since the postponement, the police had found two witnesses, Mr. Liu and Ge Chen Liangbin (both tea boys at the New New Hotel), who testified that before the incident, the defendant had been loitering in the hotel corridor for quite some time. The handgun used in the crime has been sent to the gun inspection bureau for examination. The examination report has not yet been received, so he requested a postponement. The court then questioned Zhou Zhanyuan, whose testimony remained the same as before. Chen Wenchuh, the deputy general manager of the New New Company, testified that he was unaware that the defendant possessed a handgun. Zhou had failed to lock the main door properly on October 29, 1930, which resulted in a major demerit. On May 2, 1933, he was given another demerit for failing to assign personnel for patrol. On October 26 of the same year, he was also given a demerit. This time, he was dismissed by Li because Zhou had failed to lock the front door. The two tea boys, Liu and Chen, testified that Zhou Zhanyuan had been pacing in the corridor with his head down before going to room 327. Not five minutes later, they heard a gunshot. Zhu Deren, the head of the security team, testified that Li Minzhou had ordered Zhou to hand over the keys, uniform, and police whistle to him. He then handed them over to him. Zhou claimed that he could not hand over the uniform until the next day because he had not brought his casual clothes. At that moment, he suddenly recalled that when Liu Xiji was the general manager, he had given Zhou a handgun. He then asked Zhou for it. Zhou replied that it was at home and would also hand it over the next day. This statement was heard by employee Xiao Zhaobin. However, Zhou denied that Zhu had asked him for the handgun. The court then summoned Xiao to the case. According to Xiao's testimony, he and Zhu were supervising Zhou's removal of his belongings when he did not hear Zhu mention the handgun. Later, when he was in the secretary's office, Zhu rushed in and said that Zhou had another gun that he would hand over the next day. He told Zhu that since he had a handgun, he should hand it over immediately. After the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer cross-examined each witness, it was past noon. Judge Feng then ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<p>=And also affected more than ten tiled houses= Over a hundred thatched huts in the west of Dapu Bridge in the Nanshi area, inhabited mostly by poor workers, rickshaw pullers, and coolies from Jiangbei, suddenly caught fire around 9:10 p.m. last night. The fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Although the Nanshi district fire brigades rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire, the wind was very strong and the fire was extremely fierce at the time, and the thatched huts were densely packed together, making it impossible to spray water effectively. The fire continued to burn until around 11 p.m. late into the night and had not been completely extinguished. As a result, more than ten tiled houses were also affected. The Second District Headquarters dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. The scene was filled with the cries of the old and young, a tragic sight that broke the heart.</p>

<p>Zhang Qiufu Extorted Money and Was Arrested. Zhang Xixi, a merchant from No. 856 Fangbang Road, Chengnai, 30 years old, from Zhenjiang, who has been running a secondhand goods store for many years, reported to the leader of the district detective team, Liu Shaoqing, and the deputy leader, Wu Kezhong, of the Second District Police Department yesterday. He said that a man named Zhang Qiufu, claiming to be a detective from the police department and falsely claiming to be a disciple of team leader Lu, had led a middle-aged man and two boys aged 14 or 15 to his store around 3 p.m. today, claiming to be searching for stolen goods and extorting 250 yuan. Liu and Wu reported this to the detective team leader, Lu Ying, who was furious and immediately dispatched Liu and Wu, along with detectives Shi Chunlin, Zhou Jizhen, Bian Wenguang, and Yu Ruhai, to investigate. After the impersonators left, detective Shi Chunlin and others went to the Fangpai Bridge teahouse, where the plaintiff, Zhang Xixi, pointed out Zhang Qiufu, the impersonator, and brought him back to the district for questioning. According to the plaintiff's statement, around 4 p.m. on the 4th, the man claiming to be detective Zhang Qiufu, along with a middle-aged man and two boys aged 14 or 15, broke into his store and searched everywhere. He then asked where the boss was and said that they should talk outside, as it would be cheaper. If they talked inside, there would be many problems. Because he was timid, he asked his neighbor, Xu Dongbao, to come out and talk to him. Zhang Qiufu said that he was a student of team leader Lu and that they had stolen water pipes worth more than 800 yuan, so he had to compensate them 250 yuan. Xu Dongbao repeatedly tried to dissuade him without success, so he came to report it. The impersonator Zhang Qiufu confessed that he went to the plaintiff's store with Siwu Hongmao and two young plumbers to see if the stolen water pipes were there. He denied the other claims. Witness Chen Dongbao's testimony corroborated the plaintiff's statement. It was confirmed that the impersonator Zhang Qiufu falsely claimed to be a student of team leader Lu, spreading rumors and extorting money, which was extremely illegal and should be severely punished according to the law. Therefore, a document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for further investigation by the Third Section.</p>

Xiu Ying, the second daughter of Jing Dafu, the owner of the Yixin Xie North Goods Store at No. 7, Dongting Mountain Lane, Nanshi, from Shaoxing, 29 years old, suddenly disappeared on the 2nd of this month. It was later learned that Xiu Ying had boarded the Hongxing steamer bound for Ningbo and drowned herself outside Wusongkou. The ship's steward confirmed this. It was then that Jing Dafu learned that his beloved daughter had been seduced by Wang Naiwen (from Ningbo), a colleague from the store. Xiu Ying had entrusted herself to him for life. However, Wang had already been engaged in his hometown and found it difficult to break off the engagement. Wang then told her the truth. Xiu Ying was filled with anger and decided to commit suicide. Afterward, Jing Dafu reported this to the First District Police Department, and Wang Naiwen was arrested. A handbag that Xiu Ying had given to him was confiscated, along with several pieces of clothing and three gold rings (one with a ruby, one with an emerald, and one with an oval-shaped stone, but they were not pure gold, all being foreign gold rings).

<p>The Victim Shot in the Shanghai West Robbery Case</p>
<p>The Guagnfeng Company North-South Ham Distribution Center, located at No. 11 Hengxing West Lane, Li Ma Road, Sixteen Pupu, Nanshi, was entrusted by Ma Zili, the manager of the Rugao Main Company, to Zhou Shuwen (30 years old, from the same hometown) and Li Shiru (from Zhenjiang). On the day before yesterday (Sunday), they had collected a large sum of money from more than thirty pig customers. Because the bank was closed on Sunday as usual, they were unable to deposit the money, which was discovered by bandits. Around 7 p.m. the night before last, five robbers with Jiangbei accents, wearing gray long robes and blue short-sleeved shirts and trousers, suddenly appeared, armed with three handguns. Three bandits guarded the front and back doors, while two bandits went straight upstairs, threatening Zhou and others to keep quiet and forcing them to hand over the key to the iron box. They opened the box and robbed 20,600 yuan in cash (all five- and ten-yuan banknotes). One of the bandits used his coat collar to collect the money and went downstairs. They locked everyone in a room behind the hall. They also stole two hams, found a large reed bag, filled it with banknotes, and pretended to be customers, calmly leaving the premises and fleeing in different directions. Furthermore, Hu Caiyuan, a local from No. 15 Houjiazhai, Hongqiao Road, Shanghai West, who worked at the Senji Flower Shop on Shanzhong Road, French Concession, was also robbed by four bandits with handguns who broke into Hu's house around 6:30 p.m. the night before last. The bandits stole more than ten yuan, a white leather suitcase, and a duffel bag filled with clothes made of gabardine and leather. As the bandits were fleeing with the stolen goods, Hu shouted for them to be caught. The bandits fired a shot at Hu, hitting Caiyuan's right foot, and he immediately fell to the ground bleeding.

<h3 id="e147">After Robbing a Huge Sum, the Bandits Held a Grand Celebration Feast <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>=One of the Bandits Had Committed Murder=</p>
<p>=All are Now Detained Awaiting Transfer to the Court= Yuan Zhaoqing, from Dongtai, who owned a rickshaw company at No. 1 Zhishun Lane, Puenji Shilu Road, French Concession, had his house invaded by more than ten armed bandits on the evening of the 29th of last month, and they robbed him of over 4,000 yuan in cash and clothing. Afterward, the victim reported this to the French police for investigation. On the 30th, detectives Lu Zhulin and Wang Rusong, deputy detectives Zhang Daorong, and plainclothes detectives Liu Jinrong and Shen Jinshi discovered that the bandits were holding a celebration feast at the house of accomplice Xu Guifa, located at No. 128 Ban, Fuxu Road, Public Concession, at 5 p.m. that afternoon. The detectives, together with the Chinese and Western detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station, rushed to the address and arrested seven bandits: Chen Zurong, Chen Jinchang, Chen Kejian, Chen Shurong, Zhang Qifu, Shen Guibao, and Zhang Asan. However, the owner of the house, Xu Guifa, had fled after hearing the news beforehand. The seven bandits were taken back to the police station. The detectives then went to the home of Chen Zurong and Chen Jinchang (brothers) at No. 18, Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, and arrested Chen's wives, Chen Shi and Chen Ge, and a woman named Huang Linmei, also known as Xiao Mao Nan, three in total. They also found four handguns, 49 bullets, and 300 yuan of the stolen cash in Chen's house. They were taken back to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation and detention. The hearing was postponed to the 13th of this month. Details have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that during the investigation, the detectives arrested the fugitive Xu Guifa (21 years old, nicknamed "Rotten Foot Little Ningbo," also known as A Hong, from Ningbo) and a suspect named Jia. They also found a handgun on the roof of Chen Zurong's house (i.e., No. 18, Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei) and took it back to the police station, sending it to the court for joint investigation. The detectives also discovered that Chen Jinchang, the second defendant, had lured Wei Qiliang, from Siyang, to an open space in Xujiatang, Yaerpei Road, French Concession, on the evening of October 15, 1928, because of a jealous dispute, shot and killed him, and abandoned the body. After the incident, the French police took the body to the autopsy station and reported it to the former French Public Concession for examination. Because there were no family members, the body was buried by the funeral parlor. The police have now found a photo of the deceased. Chen Jinchang confessed that he had killed Wei Qiliang. The police chief ordered a detailed confession to be recorded and held for joint trial in the court.</p>
<h3 id="e148">After Zheng Mingshan's Death, His Brother and Wife Became Involved in a Lawsuit <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>=Mingshan Had No Heir, So His Brother's Son Inherited=</p>
<p>=The Brother Accused His Sister-in-Law of Embezzling the Inheritance=</p>
<p>=Now Mingshan's Wife is Suing Her Brother for False Accusation= The Rongyang and Gongzu socks factories were founded by Zheng Fengshan and Zheng Mingshan, brothers. The business was thriving and profitable. However, Mingshan, although in his prime, had no children. Therefore, he adopted Baiquan, the son of his brother Fengshan, as his heir. Unexpectedly, Mingshan suddenly fell ill and passed away two years ago. All of his inheritance was legally inherited by his wife, Zheng Yu Jingxiu, and his adopted son, Baiquan. At that time, because Baiquan was young, Zheng Yu Jingxiu, as his mother, was also his legal guardian and manager of the assets under Baiquan's name. Unexpectedly, Zheng Fengshan suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court last year, accusing Zheng Yu Jingxiu of embezzling the inheritance. The Special Court held a hearing and summoned her, but because Zheng Fengshan was not qualified, the court ruled that it would not accept the case. However, Zheng Yu Jingxiu felt aggrieved by the unfounded lawsuit and hired two lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji, to file a lawsuit against Zheng Fengshan for false accusation in the First Special District Court. The main points of her lawsuit were as follows: In the previous case where Zheng Fengshan sued the plaintiff for embezzlement in the court, his statement alleged that the plaintiff was naturally superstitious and extremely wasteful, spending extravagantly without regard for the cost. After receiving the inheritance, she abused her rights at will, disposed of the assets without authorization, and secretly colluded with Yu Xifan, now the general manager of the two factories, allowing him to wield power alone and manage them improperly, causing losses. She also secretly mortgaged all the assets under different names, with cunning schemes and cruel methods. All of these allegations were fabricated. The plaintiff's family has always been frugal, and she has not secretly disposed of the assets under different names. Even if she had, it would be an inherent right of the owner. Moreover, what he said was not true. Yu Xifan is currently the assistant manager of the Gongzu Socks Factory, elected by the shareholders, and not the general manager of the two factories. The defendant was aware of these facts but wanted to illegally seize the property rights, fabricating baseless accusations and filing a lawsuit for embezzlement with the intention of causing others to be criminally punished. He had committed a crime under Article 180, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and should be severely punished. The court approved the request and ordered a collective hearing in the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Wu Zehan. The plaintiff Zheng Yu Jingxiu was represented by two lawyers, Chen and Sun, while the defendant Zheng Fengshan was absent, and his lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that Zheng had left Shanghai due to important matters and requested a postponement. Judge Wu granted the postponement for seven days, pending the defendant's appearance in court for further verification.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The Situation of Various Parks in the Public Concession <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>=A Total of More Than 3.39 Million Visitors=</p>
<p>=An Increase of 1.26 Million Compared to the Previous Year=</p>
<p>The report on the work of the director of the Parks Management Office of the Municipal Council for the past year stated that the areas of the parks that were expanded this year included the northeastern part of Hongkou Park. After renovation, more than ten ball fields were added. The land at the western end of Jiaozhou Road Park was slightly repaired using materials from the dismantled Singapore Road Park.</p>
<p>Hongkou Park: This year, the total number of visitors to Hongkou Park was 1,178,293, an increase of more than 392,000 compared to the previous year and more than 568,000 compared to the year before. The day with the most visitors was July 16, with 46,209 people, breaking all previous records. The new constructions in the park included several stone statues, transplanted next to the rest hall, and a chain fence added to the flower bed opposite the Bailinan Road Park gate. A summer pavilion, five drinking fountains, and two restrooms were built in the park, and trees were planted. The chrysanthemum and dahlia exhibitions were praised by botanists. The zoo section was often crowded on weekends. More than 70 birds and animals were donated and purchased.</p>
<p>Hongkou Park: This park rebuilt 3 stone bridges, filled in a small pond, repaired several sections of the pond bank, and added four drinking fountains. The sports facilities included football, basketball, baseball, team ball, grass field, and hard court tennis courts. In addition, there were golf courses, fishing areas, and track and field venues.</p>
<p>Huishan Park: This park has been attracting more attention year by year. This year, a flower garden was created on the site of the lotus pond and redecorated. A section of the walkway was paved with cement. Grass field and grass tennis courts were also popular.</p>
<p>Bund Park: Stone walls have been built around the flower beds and trees have been planted to provide protection. The environment of this park is not very suitable for flowers, but this year's flower exhibition was still noteworthy.</p>
<p>Children's Playground: The Kunshan Road square in the children's playground was always full of people, making it difficult to maintain the lawn in good condition. The Nanyang Road playground was redesigned, with raised lawns, repaired roads, built grass huts, and transplanted trees. Too many adults entered Singapore Park, which interfered with children's play. A part of the park is currently being used to build a Chinese girls' middle school, so there have been slight changes to the park. To maintain the tranquility of the children's games, efforts have been made to restrict pedestrians from passing through Zhoushan Park. The Suzhou Road playground was also very popular.</p>
<p>Open-Air Music: Last year, 29 orchestral concerts, 31 brass band concerts, 4 military band concerts, and 12 military performances (retirement songs) were held in various parks. On average, 108 people attended each afternoon concert and 367 people attended each evening concert.</p>
<p>Visitor Statistics</p>
<p>Last year, in addition to 1,178,293 visitors to Hongkou Park, Hongkou Park had 904,917 visitors, Bund Park had 652,134 visitors, and other parks and children's playgrounds had 661,525 visitors, for a total of 3,396,869 visitors, an increase of 1,268,684 compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>Various Organizations Consult and Mediate</p>
<p>Several hundred houses on Waima Road in Wusong Town, all owned by Renchanghe Company, were destroyed in the war. A portion of the houses has been completed. However, a major dispute has arisen regarding the rental of houses between new and old tenants. The general old tenants have organized the "Resident United Benefit Association," petitioning various authorities in Wusong to appeal and demand: (1) Old tenants have priority in renting; (2) Rent increases shall not exceed 20% of the original rent; (3) Security deposits shall comply with the regulations promulgated by the Municipal Government; (4) Abolish illegal exactions such as "small rent digging fees." Although the houses have been completed, neither new nor old tenants can move in for the time being. Wusong authorities believe that the houses on Waima Road are of great importance to the development of business in the city and fear that the dispute will escalate, hindering social security. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the 7th District Public Security Bureau discussed solutions. Municipal Committee member Tang Chengzong, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Zhang Yuci, Party Department members Wang Cheng'e, Wu Renji, 7th District Officer Yin Gongtian, and others consulted and decided: (1) Regarding illegal exactions such as small rents, the Party Department will investigate and the Public Security Bureau will handle the case; (2) It was decided to convene representatives of landlords and tenants at the Wusong Municipal Office at 1:00 PM on the 8th of this month for mediation.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Truth About Patriotic Female Teacher Huang Shuiqing's Suicide Attempt <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>=Unrelated to Love or Economics, Suicide Attempt is Also First Time=</p>
<p>=Resentful of Treatment by Current Principal, She Attempts Suicide in Anger= Ms. Huang Shan (also known as Bingqing), a teacher at the Patriotic Girls' School, came to Shanghai on the 1st of this month and stayed at the Xinhuizhong Hotel. She took sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide. The waiter discovered her and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Shanghai reporters conducted separate investigations to clarify the truth. The details are as follows: The Cause of Suicide</p>
<p>Ms. Huang is a Minhang native. She graduated from Beijing Women's Normal School. Because she liked sports, she entered the physical education department of the Patriotic Girls' School. After graduation, she continued to serve at her alma mater. She was highly valued by former principals Ji Rongwu and Ji Yisheng for her capable handling of affairs. After Sun Xiangzhong became principal the year before last, she once worked at schools such as Anhui Second Women's School. Later, Principal Sun repeatedly wrote letters to her, urging her to serve at her alma mater, with an agreed that with one patriotic day, Bingqing would be at the Patriotic school for one day). The words were sincere, so Ms. Huang returned to Shanghai to serve as the head of the Girl Scout troop and a physical education teacher at her alma mater. She was extremely responsible for school affairs. For example, when the January 28th Incident broke out, the school was located in the war zone, which was extremely dangerous. The principal, teachers, and staff all fled. Nearby students went home, while more than 20 students from far away were led by Ms. Huang Shan and Ms. Wei Yunqing to take refuge in Moore Hall. They joined the Girl Scout battlefield service group, serving the community on the one hand and taking care of their classmates on the other. After the war subsided, the school rented temporary school buildings in Continental Village. Huang returned to the school, but the school was economically exhausted due to the damage from the Shanghai War. When salaries were not paid, Huang still endured hardships and worked diligently, maintaining the school for a semester. Whenever there were sports meets or Girl Scout inspections, even when she was sick, she still made efforts to serve the public. Her efforts to serve her alma mater can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Suicide Attempt and Rescue During this year's winter vacation, Huang took a vacation to Hangzhou and stayed with her sister, Huang Lian, waiting for school to start. Unexpectedly, on January 17th, she received a letter from Principal Sun, using the excuse of the school's financial difficulties and wanting to reduce her salary. The words not only did not mention her past merits but also used sophisticated methods to satirize her. After reading the letter, Ms. Huang recalled the past and was filled with grief and indignation. Her sister then wrote a reply on her behalf, questioning Principal Sun. On the 24th, she received another reply from Principal Sun, which made Ms. Huang even more embarrassed. Therefore, her sister wrote a second letter refuting him. After this, Ms. Huang cried all day, even staying up late at night. Her sister was deeply worried. On February 1st, Huang took advantage of her sister and brother-in-law being out for work to leave a note and come to Shanghai, staying at the Huizhong Hotel. Her brother-in-law, Mr. Ge, tracked her to Shanghai and searched everywhere, but there was no news. Until the morning before yesterday, the hotel waiter discovered that Ms. Huang had taken sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide. The police sent her to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and she was rescued and survived.</p>
<p>Interview Process Yesterday, Ms. Huang moved into Tongde Hospital. The reporter visited her at the hospital and saw that she was lying peacefully on the bed and was conscious. However, she still resented Sun Xiangzhong very much and occasionally complained. Ms. Huang's father and sisters were taking care of her by her side. The reporter felt that Ms. Huang was too stimulated and did not want to talk too much, so her sister, Huang Lian, reported the truth about the suicide to the reporter, saying that rumors of a second suicide were completely false. The family's economic situation was still relatively affluent, and there was no relationship with love. Huang's suicide was entirely due to Sun Xiangzhong's disregard for past kindness, inviting her to come and dismissing her, which caused her to be stimulated.</p>

<p>Dear Chief Editor, Our association previously believed that the Chinese film industry's products in recent years have been mostly propaganda with a proletarian nature, which is seriously harmful to the country and poisons society. We specially issued a declaration to advise on modifications. Before the modifications were made, we prohibited the screening of various situations. We were very grateful for the earlier disclosure. According to the advertisements in various newspapers, the Mingxing Company's emergency announcement stated that three films, including (Salt Tide), (Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours), and (Vanilla Beauty), have been diligently modified. After sending people to investigate secretly, it was reported that it was indeed true. The company is so knowledgeable about righteousness and deserves praise. I hereby send you a letter to tell you to publish it in the letter section to encourage and hope that all cinemas will continue to show the three films. I wish you good writing.

<h3 id="e164">The Current Cigarette Tax Rate is the Same for the Government and Chinese Merchants <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Request to the Government for Detailed Reconsideration and Prompt Improvement of Losses (Continued) by Huang Ziping</p>
<p>However, this is only in regard to the cigarette industry. If we discuss native tobacco leaves, the losses are also quite significant. Lower-grade cigarettes are entirely made from native leaves, and because the tax on lower-grade cigarettes is heavy and thus uncompetitive, the sales of native tobacco leaves will inevitably stagnate as well. According to statistics from the People's Cigarette Company and other sources, the annual sales of native tobacco leaves produced in areas such as Susong, Huanggang, Xinchang, Dengzhou, Champion, Guangshui, and Junzhou were approximately 390,000 bales under the seven-tier tax system before 1930. After the implementation of the three-tier tax system in November 1930, this figure decreased to 260,000 bales. After the implementation of the two-tier tax system in 1932, it further decreased to 115,000 bales. Recently, with the tax reform, it is said that these tobacco leaves are almost ignored. The Tax Bureaus in Jiujiang and Laohekou have established native tobacco offices and it is requested to forward letters to the Tax Bureau ordering them to investigate and report back, which will surely reveal the truth. Under the current tax system, the tax on native tobacco is four yuan, one jiao, and four fen per hundred jin. If this leads to a decline in sales, what will be the government's loss in tax revenue? What will be the loss to the rural areas as tobacco farmers go bankrupt? These are figures that cannot be calculated. All of this is closely related to the foundation of the nation and the national economy. Those who set tax rates must consider the importance of China and the Chinese nation and take all of this into account. It is believed that the error of the two-tier tax system lies entirely in the tax reduction for high-grade cigarettes and the tax increase for lower-grade cigarettes. High-grade cigarettes are expensive, while lower-grade cigarettes are cheap. Under the seven-tier tax system, the selling price of a carton of high-grade cigarettes was 1,052 yuan, with a tax of 404 yuan. The selling price of a carton of seven-grade cigarettes was 125 yuan, with a tax of 29 yuan. This adheres to the principle of tax averaging, taxing according to value. The tax on one carton of high-grade cigarettes is more than enough to offset the tax on a dozen cartons of lower-grade cigarettes. Therefore, to ensure sufficient tax revenue, one must treat high, medium, and low-grade cigarettes equally, and not focus solely on lower-grade cigarettes. Let us assume that the government must raise 3.8 million yuan in additional cigarette taxes. If this burden is not placed solely on the lower-grade cigarettes of Chinese merchants, but also shared by the high-grade cigarettes of British and American merchants, then, as a concession, let each bear half the burden. Chinese merchants would only need to bear an additional 1.9 million yuan. Why should they bear the heavy tax of over 14 million yuan? If it is said that regardless of the people's ability to bear the burden, Chinese merchants must bear an additional 14 million yuan in taxes, and British and American merchants should bear the same amount, then, since the sales volume of British and American cigarettes is greater than that of Chinese merchants, and what they sell is the expensive high-grade cigarettes, taxing according to value, the tax payments of British and American merchants will simultaneously increase by more than 30 million yuan. The government's revenue, combined, could increase by 50 million yuan annually. Therefore, for the sake of increasing tax revenue, the government must impose the same tax on high, medium, and low-grade cigarettes. The logic is very simple. Under the two-tier tax system, the tax on lower-grade cigarettes is excessively high, while the tax rate on high-grade cigarettes is too low, only causing endless losses to Chinese merchants and allowing British and American merchants to reap huge profits. It can truly be said to have a hundred harms and not a single benefit. However, this is still in regard to the two-tier tax system of 1932. Under the current two-tier tax system, first-grade cigarettes are almost non-existent, practically zero. What is actually collected is only the second grade, which is essentially a one-tier tax. The tax on lower-grade cigarettes has increased from 55 yuan per carton to 80 yuan per carton, an even greater increase than before. The tax on high-grade cigarettes has decreased from 95 yuan per carton to 80 yuan per carton, an even greater decrease than before. It has not been implemented for long, and the losses to Chinese merchants and the profits to British and American merchants have not been clearly statistically quantified. However, based on previous methods of calculation, the losses to Chinese merchants are likely to be over 20 million yuan annually, and the profits to British and American merchants are at least 16 or 17 million yuan. If it is continued to be implemented, these remaining forty or fifty Chinese merchants will inevitably go bankrupt one after another, and all domestic native tobacco leaves will be eliminated. Tobacco farmers in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui will subsequently go bankrupt. Alas, the government is supposed to be a government for the people. It would not bear to be a tool of the British and Americans, killing off Chinese merchants and tobacco farmers, and sacrificing domestic native tobacco leaves and tobacco taxes as funeral objects, allowing British and American merchants to sit back and suck the marrow of 16 or 17 million yuan annually from Chinese merchants. Therefore, it is urgent to rise up and immediately abolish it, without allowing any hesitation. Some may say that, as mentioned above, the current tax system, with a tax of 80 yuan per carton on lower-grade cigarettes, and a discretionary increase on high and medium-grade cigarettes according to their grade, is a brilliant way to raise funds. However, it is believed that this is not the case. A tax of 80 yuan per carton on lower-grade cigarettes is a heavy tax of 120% of the value, which the people cannot afford at this time. The recent bankruptcies of Chinese merchants are the result of the unbearable heavy tax on lower-grade cigarettes. If high and medium-grade cigarettes are also taxed at 120% of their value, it will lead to the ruin of the entire cigarette industry, causing the government and cigarette merchants to suffer together. There is no way this can be done. The only solution is to adopt the principle of equal burden for high, medium, and low-grade cigarettes, and to set the tax rate at a moderate level. The newly set two-tier tax rates, with 36% of the value for high-grade cigarettes and 120% of the value for low-grade cigarettes, are both too low and too high. If they are moderately revised to a uniform 50% to 60% of the value, the burden on cigarette merchants will be more fair, and the government's tax revenue, although reduced for lower-grade cigarettes, will greatly increase for high and medium-grade cigarettes, which will benefit the national treasury. The association does not have accurate records of the selling prices and sales volumes of various cigarette brands, and the government has not published them. Ziping and others have no basis for calculating. The Tax Bureau should have detailed registrations. If the discussion is based on this principle, a proper reading and response can surely be determined.</p>
<h3 id="e165">On Studying Language <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance: The discontinuation of the Shenbao reader advisory column filled me with endless melancholy! Now, the establishment of reading guidance fills me with boundless joy! Indeed, reading the reading questions and answers for the past few days has increased my knowledge significantly. However, my questions are not similar to those, and everyone has their own reading plan. Therefore, I am taking advantage of this only one hour to write this (My One-Year Reading Plan) for the consideration of you gentlemen. I am a knowledge-starved person, deeply feeling the pain of insufficient vocabulary. When I pick up a pen, I cannot express my own meaning; when I pick up a book, I cannot understand anything slightly deeper. Therefore, I do not dare to blindly study anything. I only strive to practice (Chinese at a level above beginner). For clarity, I will elaborate on my situation below.</p>
<p>My Environment: I am currently an apprentice in a store in a small town. Although I do not even have an hour of time each day, I have made up my mind to quit this trade after the Lunar New Year. (The reason for quitting: I labor all day, all month, and all year, and the reward is only thirty yuan a year! Moreover, there is no good future in this. Because I cannot find a suitable occupation for the time being, I plan to use this (One-Year Reading Plan) to return to my hometown and study on my own for a year. Fortunately, my family can still afford my food and clothing.) At that time, I will have ample time, a quiet life, and be able to focus on self-study, which I will definitely be able to do.</p>
<p>My Level: I attended junior high school for one semester, and then fell into this trap: the store. Although I have read many novels, both old and new, I have only glanced at them and have not read most of them carefully. I cannot understand classical Chinese without annotations, and modern poetry is too new and I do not understand it. For example, I am not qualified to appreciate the poetry of modernism. It is shameful to say, but my Chinese seems to have no foundation. However, I am still young (eighteen years old this year). As long as I can work hard, I can always achieve my hopes, right?</p>
<p>My Hopes: I do not hope to become a writer (this is a dream). I only hope that I can understand all ancient books and appreciate poetry such as modernism; when I pick up a pen, I can express my meaning as I wish. In short, I only hope to become someone who is (above the basic level in Chinese).</p>
<p>One-Year Reading Plan: Select and read one classical Chinese article every day, and read it thoroughly. Read a certain number of pages of books (ancient or new; specify how many books to read in a year). In addition, subscribe to one magazine and one newspaper. Practice writing a certain amount every day, and write several essays every week. All of this is specified. This is my one-year plan. As for whether this can achieve my hopes, that is another matter, because this is only the first stage of my plan.</p>
<p>I can only write such a superficial plan as above. Really, I cannot write any better. I hope that the teacher can revise it or provide another (One-Year Self-Study Curriculum). In this letter, there are many questions that I will write down together: (1) For someone like me, are my hopes too extravagant? (2) What classical Chinese should I read? What books should I read? (Please provide a detailed list.) (3) What kind of essays should I write? Is it okay to write novels? (4) Is it beneficial to join the Commercial Press Correspondence School? (5) What books should I read more of? What books are most suitable for me? (Specify a range to avoid being lost in the vast sea of learning.) I hope the above five questions can be answered together. I deeply hope that the teacher's revised plan can guide me into a regulated reading process, approaching with a certain purpose and following a predetermined step-by-step approach.</p>
<p>I deeply await it here. (Letter from Cheng Keying) Corrections: 1. Yesterday's title should be changed to (The Logic of Reading). 2. The name Li Siqi should be in parentheses ( ) and the words (Letter) should be added. 3. In the first line of the third column, the (,) after (and) should be removed and a (个) should be added to become (an individual's purpose...)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e166">Winter Vacation <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>I remember that winter vacation was two weeks long, from January 18th to 31st, which was stipulated by the Ministry of Education, for all universities, middle schools, and primary schools. In some years, these two weeks coincided with the end and beginning of the Lunar New Year, but this year is unlucky. The new semester begins on February 1st, which is only the 18th day of the twelfth lunar month. This means that school will start on the 18th day of the twelfth lunar month, and classes will be held on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, this year's winter vacation for various schools has undergone a major and special change, regardless of violating the orders of the Ministry of Education or the Bureau of Education. Not to mention the rural schools, even if the teachers do not take a Lunar New Year vacation, the students will still give the teachers a vacation. In Shanghai, some universities take a month off, from the end of the Lunar New Year to the beginning of the new year; some middle schools take three weeks off, from mid-January to mid-February; some primary schools start school on the 27th or 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, and the most common is starting school at the end of the Lunar New Year. Those who start school after the Lunar New Year reason that society still celebrates the Lunar New Year, everyone is busy preparing for the New Year at the end of the year, and everyone is desperately short of money. If school starts within the year, where will the students get the money to pay all the tuition and board fees? They are considerate of the fact that students' parents have difficulty raising funds within the year, and they are unwilling to let students enter school and pay fees after the New Year, fearing that they will not receive their fees after they enter school. Those who start school at the end of the year do so because the first week of school cannot actually be used for classes. It is nominally starting school within the year, but in reality, it is equivalent to taking off the first day of the Lunar New Year. Even the students will definitely not come to school at the end of the year. On the one hand, school is considered to have started within the year, which also counts as not violating the orders of the superiors. This method is the most clever.</p>
<p>Although the dates for winter vacation are stipulated, the various schools are giving vacations in such a colorful variety of ways. I do not know how the competent authorities will maintain their prestige. But looking at it broadly, what can be done to ensure that orders are followed and prestige is maintained? This extremely ordinary matter of winter vacation is being dealt with carelessly. What does it matter?</p>
<h3 id="e167">Refuting Rumors <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The third young lady of the Yang Mansion lives in seclusion in her boudoir and rarely goes out. Although everyone does not mention her name very often, whenever her name is mentioned, everyone admits that she is as pure as ice and jade. However, recently, rumors have suddenly spread that on a certain day in a certain month, Miss Yang III had a secret rendezvous with someone at a certain place. This matter is a castle in the air and not worth believing. If the accused dismisses it with a laugh, the rumors will soon be stopped by the wise and no one will talk about it anymore. But Miss Yang III insisted on publicly refuting the rumors in the newspaper and at the same time pursued the rumor-mongers through legal procedures. Such a commotion will surely cause a sensation throughout the city, known to women and children. Although there will eventually be a day when the truth comes out, it will inevitably leave a very deep and bad impression in the minds of people. Some people even speculate that Miss Yang III may have done such a thing, otherwise, the pure would be pure and the impure would be impure, why make such a fuss?</p>
<p>Logically, refuting rumors is naturally a legitimate procedure, but in this day and age, rumors have changed somewhat and are like a mischievous child. Modern educators do not advocate whipping children, especially mischievous children. Indeed, we can often see impatient mothers whipping mischievous children. The more they whip, the more mischievous the children become. Mothers who understand the principles of education always patiently guide their children and can educate them well. Rumors are also like this. For example, the story of Miss Yang III mentioned above. If Miss Yang III treats the baseless rumors as a mischievous child and simply shows people her pure and jade-like facts, the rumors will be defeated without being attacked.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, some people are kidnapped by kidnappers. When newspaper reporters go to the address to interview, the family members of the kidnapped people shake their heads and deny that such a thing happened. Naturally, this makes it difficult for the news to spread. This achieves the opposite effect compared to formally refuting rumors. This is a spirit worth admiring.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Jenga's Random Thoughts <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jenga</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>(Plan) and (Hope) are different, hope is always an empty fantasy, but a plan has the possibility of being realized.</p>
<p>(A year's plan lies in spring, a day's plan lies in morning). This way, people have already determined their plans ahead of time.</p>
<p>If we compare people to vehicles, then the plan is the track. With a stable track, we can drive safely. It can be seen that, regardless of whether the matter is big or small, there should be a precise plan. Although the plan may not be fully realized, it can at least reduce the components of failure.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>The environment is created by people, but people hate the environment, so there is an extreme contradiction!</p>
<p>For example, people who live in the city, on the one hand, they curse the city, on the other hand, they are obsessed with the city, they are not satisfied with the current environment, and they cannot summon the courage to transform the environment!</p>
<p>We believe that the environment can change people, but it can only change people with weak wills; people with strong wills can overcome adverse environments everywhere.</p>
<p>Friends: Let us be a team of soldiers fighting the environment!</p>
<p>Experience</p>
<p>In the great universe, there are all kinds of phenomena; in the process of life, there are all kinds of tastes; only experience can taste all kinds of tastes from this great universe.</p>
<p>A scientist can invent unprecedented physics, a philosopher can utter amazing remarks, an artist can write beautiful poems or draw pictures... these all come from experience, who can say that experience is nosy?</p>
<p>The great Russian writer Turgenev, he was willing to give up aristocratic life to be a vagrant, and he finally obtained a great career through the experience of wandering.</p>
<p>Therefore, experience is not only a kind of intimate lesson, but also a ladder to success.</p>

<p>Chapter 24: Drinking and Eating Together, a Wild Farewell Feast Full of Tears; Burning the Midnight Oil and Dreaming, Singing Softly Through the Long Night.</p>
<p>He said this very naturally, but when Ziqiang heard it, he felt that every word was like a needle, stabbing into his heart. Although he wanted to use a few words to comfort Guizhi in his heart, his tongue would not obey his command, and he could not say a word. The Jiang family saw him standing there stiffly, his hands hanging straight down, as if he was standing at attention with his new wife, so she said to him: Son-in-law, don't worry. We are not so ignorant. Since you have returned on leave, you still have official duties to attend to. You can take care of it yourself.</p>
<p>You should leave today if you should leave today. If you can delay it for another day, it will be easier to leave tomorrow. Old man, what do you think of my words? Saying this, she turned her face to Zhao Weng. Zhao Weng said: Dear lady, your words show how much you care for your son-in-law. What else can our children say? Ziqiang, I don't think you can leave today. Fortunately, although the telegram has arrived, it has not specified which day you have to arrive by. Relatively speaking, if you want to be more relaxed, you should leave tomorrow. Ziqiang then opened his mouth and said: Yes, I have also calculated that the car will enter the city at 6:30 tomorrow morning, catching the 8:00 train to Shanhaiguan at the East Station. I will get off at Luanzhou and go back by land. Zhao Weng said: That's up to you. As he spoke, his hand kept rising and wiping down the newspaper, as if this action could relieve the depression in his heart. The Jiang family said to Guizhi: Go home and sit down. He heard this and followed his mother back home. Ziqiang said to Zhao Weng: As far as I can see, there is nothing going on at the front, it's just that Battalion Commander Bao can't do without me. Zhao Weng said: But the rules in the military camp, except for the front line when the fighting is on, as long as you apply for a marriage leave, you can always get it approved. Why did he send you a telegram to urge you before your leave was over? I'm afraid there are some reasons in this? How could Ziqiang dare to say that there was a reason? He stood still and did not say anything. (239)</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Three Friends of Winter <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Pine, bamboo, and plum are the three friends of winter. A few days ago, Suzhou was covered in snow, which was the day when the three friends of winter were in the limelight. In the vast expanse of white, there were green pines, green bamboos, and red plums, embellishing it, how beautiful it was!</p>
<p>The poets of the past praised the maple leaves, saying that they were more beautiful than the flowers of February. However, when the year is coming to an end, the pine, bamboo, and plum trees show off their beauty even more beautifully than the maple leaves by ten times.</p>
<p>The ancients compared the pine to a doctor, but I compare it to a loyal and brave man, unchanging in his integrity. I often say that the 19th Route Army in the January 28th Incident was as stubborn as a pine tree, not afraid of the bullying of strong neighbors, just like the pine tree in the snow, revealing its heroic posture. Since the Fujian Incident, I feel that the 19th Route Army is not as unchanging in its integrity and stubborn to the end as the pine tree.</p>
<p>The ancients compared bamboo to a gentleman, but I compare it to a talented man who is unappreciated. In ordinary times, his true talent and practical knowledge cannot be seen, and he does not show his abilities, burying himself for life. When the opportunity comes, Pang Tong is not just a talent for a hundred miles. What others cannot do, he can do everything. He is lonely and proud throughout his life, unloved, and preserves his original spirit, holding his embrace, untainted by dust. He is truly what Ruan Ji's madness is, how could he be a mere hawker? It is a pity that there are not many people who love bamboo and talent. The ancients compared plum to a beauty, but I compare it to a simple woman. In a depressed economy, it is rare to find a woman who values frugality. The so-called beauties of the times are nothing more than wild lions and wild cats! Chastity is not discussed, extravagance is valued, and the social atmosphere is getting worse and worse, with people deceiving each other.</p>
<p>I feel that the plum blossom is cold and fragrant, and lonely and proud, with no trace of fear. No wonder Lin Chushi loved it like a wife. Alas! In this vast world, how many people are like the pine, bamboo, and plum in the snow?</p>

<h3 id="e172">Wine Contains Vitamin B2 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Yamada Yutaka, a graduate student at the Osaka Municipal Hygiene Laboratory in Japan, under the guidance of Dr. Fujiwara Kuzujiro, the director of the laboratory, discovered new information in the chemical history of vitamins. As a result of his analysis and research on various types of wine, he discovered that wine contains vitamin B2. This vitamin B2 is a major component of nutrients for the human body. Because vitamin B can be divided into five types: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, vitamin 1 is rich in the function of preventing beriberi, and vitamin B has the effect of promoting the development of various parts of the body. Yamada's paper proves that the vitamin contained in wine is based on comparative experiments on several types of beer, wine, Japanese sake, and Shaoxing wine. The alcohol in Shaoxing wine is the least, but the vitamin content is the highest. Therefore, it is considered inappropriate to legally prohibit minors from drinking alcohol, because when they drink alcohol, their faces turn red, their ears turn warm, which is a manifestation of stimulating blood vessel expansion, which is also the effect of vitamin B2, which promotes the function of body development. Therefore, old Shaoxing wine has a great effect on people with neurasthenia and pale complexion. The various medicinal wines passed down by our Chinese people, in addition to the medicinal properties that can eliminate diseases, the greatest benefit to the body is the vitamin B2 in the wine. Mr. Yamada once carefully experimented with white rats and expressed his opinion. He said: Use 30 grams of white rats, use low temperature and low pressure to remove the alcohol and water in Japanese sake, beer, wine, and Shaoxing wine, so that it becomes a kind of concentrated liquid. If we add feed lacking vitamin B2 to feed the white rats, and compare it with the feed that does not add this concentrated liquid to feed the white rats, the results of their development show that the white rats that do not eat the concentrated liquid will die in less than 50 days, and the feed with the concentrated liquid of wine can live up to 87 days, and if you add beer, Japanese sake, and Shaoxing wine, it can survive to more than 100 days. Therefore, the weight of the white rats can reach 210 grams if the concentrated liquid of wine is added as feed, which proves that the vitamin B2 in wine has a great effect on developing and promoting the function of the body.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Kerosene Can Cure Lung Disease <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Experiments on eating kerosene to treat lung disease have now been proven in both Eastern and Western countries. It was initially discovered in the case of a young woman who committed suicide, the daughter of a carriage business owner. She suffered from lung disease and,厌世, committed suicide.</p>
<p>She secretly drank a bottle of kerosene, believing she would bid farewell to the world forever. Unexpectedly, after drinking the kerosene, her lung disease was greatly alleviated, shocking society. Later, doctors began experimenting with kerosene, and it consistently proved effective. Moreover, it was determined that kerosene is highly effective for laryngeal tuberculosis, hemorrhoids, caries of the spine, and other forms of tuberculosis, as well as diabetes and asthma. Previously, scholars worldwide were aware of countless medications for lung disease, but they were all harmful rather than beneficial. Later, treatment methods emphasized rest, a change of environment for recovery, proper nourishment, and natural therapies such as absorbing fresh air. However, these methods could not fundamentally cure the disease. Now, after experiments on animals by renowned medical experts and chemists, kerosene has been recognized as an unparalleled remedy for eradicating tuberculosis. It is said that a capitalist in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, lived to the age of 113 because he regularly consumed kerosene. Among the workers at the Yamazumi Oil &amp; Coal Company in Yamaguchi Prefecture, not a single person suffered from lung disease. The director of the Hyogo Prefectural Children's Research Institute, Dr. Torakazu Hayami, eradicated various diseases of the stomach, intestines, and kidneys by drinking 30 grams of kerosene in divided doses. When he dripped a drop of kerosene into a culture of tuberculosis bacteria, the bacteria were completely killed, demonstrating kerosene's strong antibacterial effect. He later experimented on rabbits and achieved remarkable results. A neighbor who had suffered from lung disease for ten years, with his lungs resembling a honeycomb and in the third and most dangerous stage, was completely cured in less than a month by drinking 15 grams of kerosene daily under his direction. The method of consumption varies depending on age and physical condition, but generally, one should start with 10 grams and not exceed 15 grams. The best time to drink it is 9 PM, without having eaten dinner. Drink it before going to bed at 9 PM, and repeat the dose in four or five days, then again in six or seven days. Gradually increasing the amount to 15 grams will naturally produce results. Therefore, scholars in various European countries now regard kerosene as a miraculous remedy for lung disease.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Undertaking the Revival of the Oriental Library <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Domestic and International Sponsorship Committees to Collect Books. The Commercial Press Allocates Annual Public Welfare Funds as a Recovery Fund. Plans to Rebuild a Grand Site, Realizable in Five Years. The Oriental Library is the only cultural treasure in Asia. During the January 28th Incident, it was completely destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. The loss cannot be measured in money alone; it is a major catastrophe in the history of world culture. Considering the significant impact of the library's destruction on society and culture, Chinese and foreign cultural circles are actively pursuing its revival, organizing the Oriental Library Revival Committee, determining a revival plan, and having the Commercial Press allocate one-third of its annual public welfare funds as a recovery fund. Sponsorship committees are being organized in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Book collection agencies are being established in seven major cultural centers in China, including Nanjing and Beiping. As of recently, tens of thousands of volumes of books have been newly collected. A large number of books from France and Germany will also be shipped to Shanghai within the month. Plans are also being made to purchase land and build a new library in the central area of Jing'an Temple to restore its former glory. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency visited Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, yesterday and obtained detailed information about the library's revival plan and current progress, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Before and After the Destruction The Oriental Library originated in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty and was officially established in the 13th year of the Republic of China. It was destroyed on January 29, 1932. The library's collection included 268,000 volumes of Chinese books and over 80,000 volumes of Western books, covering all essential reference books in various scientific disciplines, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. There were over 5,000 types of charts, including films of books collected by the Roman Pope Vatican Palace, Empress Dowager, Queen, and Crown Prince of the Tang Dynasty at the end of the Ming Dynasty, along with their officials and converts to Catholicism. The collection of rare books included the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature, local chronicles, and three major categories of Chinese and foreign magazines and newspapers, which were particularly valuable. In addition, there were many volumes of Western ancient books printed before the 15th century, totaling 463,083 volumes. On January 29, 1932, the library was bombed and burned by Japanese aircraft, and the cultural collection accumulated over thirty years was reduced to ashes. The material loss exceeded one million yuan.</p>
<p>Undertaking the Revival After resuming business last year, the Commercial Press deeply felt that the destruction of the Oriental Library had a significant impact on Chinese social culture and scholarship. It immediately began planning its revival. Recently, the Oriental Library Revival Committee was organized, and revival steps and plans were drawn up and actively implemented. Hu Shi, Cai Yuanpei, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Jusheng, Wang Yunwu, and international scholars such as Geller from the United States, Oudemans from Germany, Zhang Xuelou from the United Kingdom, and Li Rong from France were appointed as committee members to establish the Oriental Library Revival Committee. Zhang Jusheng was elected as chairman, and Cai and Wang were elected as standing committee members. Pan Guanghui was appointed as secretary, responsible for carrying out all tasks.</p>
<p>International Support International academic and cultural circles are enthusiastic about planning the revival of the Oriental Library. Sponsorship committees will soon be organized in France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. Zhang Xuelou will organize the British Sponsorship Committee, Oudemans will organize the German Sponsorship Committee, Li Rong will organize the French Sponsorship Committee, and Geller will organize the American Sponsorship Committee. Sponsorship committees will also be established in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Beiping, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hankou, and Changsha, with Luo Jialun, Guo Renyuan, Yuan Tongli, Quan Xiangfan, He Siyuan, Yang Duanliu, and Cao Dianqiu responsible for managing them respectively. They will be fully organized and established within a few days.</p>
<p>Collecting Books The most important task in the revival of the Oriental Library is the collection of books. Wang Yunwu told reporters yesterday that tens of thousands of volumes have been collected successively, including Commercial Press publications and private donations. After the establishment of domestic and international sponsorship committees, they will carry out their activities separately, and good results are expected. Recently, the German side has collected over 2,000 volumes of great works of French literature and chemical and pharmaceutical yearbooks as voluntary donations. These books will be shipped to Shanghai in the middle of next month. At the same time, in France, after Mr. Li Rong contacted the Minister of Education, the French government expressed sympathy and will also donate and ship a large number of valuable books to Shanghai recently. Private individuals in China are also very enthusiastic about donating. The method of collecting books is divided into two types: donation and loan. The Revival Committee will be responsible for the transportation costs of books donated or borrowed from various places.</p>
<p>Building a New Library All the books collected so far will be stored temporarily in a book storage room in Shanghai, which is currently located on the fourth floor of the Commercial Press Distribution Office. A plan to rebuild the Oriental Library is underway, with a budget of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, which will be grander than the previous building. It has been decided to allocate one-third of the Commercial Press's annual public welfare funds as the foundation. Over 45,000 yuan has been obtained for the previous year. Mr. Zhang Jusheng has personally donated 10,000 yuan. It is expected that the new library will be built in five years. The new location will be selected in the Jing'an Temple area of the city to facilitate public reading. Before the new library is built, all books will be temporarily rented in suitable locations and opened to the public to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu's Final Words Wang Yunwu told the Shenshi News Agency reporter that when the Oriental Library was destroyed, his colleagues and others immediately made the decision to revive it. Due to the brutality of the Japanese, the international community is willing to provide active assistance. At that time, after the catastrophe, the Commercial Press itself still needed to be urgently restored, so he had no time to take care of it. Now that the Commercial Press's revival work is somewhat grounded, the revival of the Oriental Library is his most urgent task. He believes that one must first help oneself before seeking help from others. Considering the magnitude of the responsibility and in order to establish a comprehensive reference organization for the domestic academic community, he aims to expedite its realization and create a new dawn for the Chinese cultural cause.</p>

<p>Decided to Start School on the 8th and Classes on the 10th.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong Expressed That the School Affairs Must Be Refreshed.</p>
<p>The Elementary School Will Still Be Managed by Wang Subenyai. Tong Xingbai, the principal of the Shanghai Private Minli Girls' Middle School, arrived at school yesterday to take office. Since Principal Wang Subenyai resigned, the school's board of directors has also been reorganized, and Tong Xingbai has been elected as the new principal. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Took Office Yesterday At 10 AM yesterday, Principal Tong arrived at the school to take office. He first met with Wu Xianren, the former director of moral education, and Li Erbai, the former school affairs committee member, to inquire about everything. He instructed them to prepare for the start of school and continue with the third enrollment. Former Principal Wang Subenyai did not arrive at the school yesterday. He handled the handover with Ms. Xu Qiongzhen, the former director of administrative affairs. A portion has been inventoried clearly, and the remaining portion will be completed in one or two days. At 12 PM, Principal Tong, accompanied by the director of moral education and others, inspected the school for a week before returning to the city party headquarters to work.</p>
<p>Scheduled Start of School The school's academic affairs office issued a notice yesterday stating that Mr. Wang Subenyai, the former principal of the school, has resigned due to personal reasons, and the board of directors has elected Mr. Tong Xingbai to succeed him. As he is just beginning to take over, he needs to reorganize everything. All originally scheduled dates for the start of school and classes will be changed. It has now been decided that school will start on the 8th of this month and classes will begin on the 10th. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Education Bureau, this is hereby announced to all students.</p>
<p>Mr. Tong's Remarks Mr. Tong Xingbai, the new principal of the school, told reporters from the Shanghai News Agency that the school's affairs and all facilities must be refreshed to satisfy the students' desire for knowledge. As for the issue of whether teachers and staff should stay or leave, he does not advocate any changes. However, new appointment letters must be issued to comply with the proceedings.</p>
<p>Elementary School Renamed The elementary school attached to Minli Girls' Middle School is managed very well, and the students are also very successful. The board of directors has now decided that Wang Subenyai will manage it himself, but the name of the attached elementary school must be changed to Benyai Elementary School for perpetuity. In addition, the board of directors has decided to rename the Minli Girls' Middle School Library as the Benyai Library in commemoration.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Children's Welfare Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Childcare Group will meet at the United Social Club at 4 PM.</p>
<p>The Health Department will convene at the Deng Tuo Mo Hotel at noon.</p>
<p>The Municipal Children's Welfare Committee has scheduled its second regular meeting of the Childcare Group of the Children's Affairs Department for tomorrow (the 7th) at 4:30 PM at the United Social Club. On the same day, the Children's Health Department will hold a gathering at the Deng Tuo Mo Hotel at noon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Regular Meeting of the Childcare Group: The Children's Affairs Group Committee of the Municipal Children's Welfare Committee decided to first establish an ordinary childcare center. However, due to the long unresolved issue of the location, active progress has been hindered. Recently, the Municipal Government approved the allocation of seven public houses near Panfang in Ximen for use. Therefore, the committee decided to convene its second regular meeting at the Shanghai United Social Club on Sanma Road at 4:30 PM tomorrow afternoon to actively prepare for the opening of the first ordinary childcare center to meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Health Department Gathering: Mr. Li Ting'an, the Health Director of the Municipal Children's Welfare Committee, is actively promoting children's health initiatives in the city, sparing no effort. In light of this year being Children's Year, Mr. Li has formulated detailed plans for addressing the health issues of children throughout the city, which urgently need discussion. It is reported that he has arranged a luncheon at the Deng Tuo Mo Hotel at noon tomorrow (the 7th) to entertain committee members of the Children's Health Department, including Wang Bin'yan, Zhu Ziqiao, Hu Xuanming, and Chen Bingqian, as well as members of the Children's Year Health Group. Standing committee members Pan Gongzhan and Hu Shuyi have also been invited to attend and jointly discuss the progress of children's health initiatives in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e185">News from Various Schools <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Wusong Merchant Marine College: The Wusong Merchant Marine College, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, was destroyed during the Shanghai War two years ago and held classes in rented buildings in Shanghai. Last year, the original school was repaired and moved back. Since then, it has made every effort to reorganize. Not only has it restored its original state, but it has also expanded its facilities. Recently, a large open-air swimming pool has been constructed, and the Shanghai Dredging Bureau has been contracted to begin work. In addition, the drilling of an artesian well has also been put out to tender and submitted to the ministry. Furthermore, due to the inadequacy of the attached high school dormitory, it is planned to build ten new buildings. Drawings and designs have already been completed. It is also reported that the school's books and equipment suffered severe losses during the Shanghai War, and efforts have been made in recent years to replenish them. A large order has been placed with a major bookstore in Shanghai, with a total value of approximately five thousand yuan. The school currently has eight classes in both navigation and marine engineering (with four classes assigned to practice on ships in the Jianghai area and at the Jiangnan Shipyard), as well as one attached high school class. All regulations are more extensive and complete than before the Shanghai War. The second semester of the 22nd academic year began on the 1st of this month, and regular classes started today (the 5th). In addition, a memorial week was held at 10:00 AM this morning (Monday) in the school's auditorium. All faculty and students attended, and Principal Xu chaired the meeting, reporting on the progress of the previous semester and the various plans for this semester. The meeting concluded at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Shenmei Girls' High School: Shenmei Girls' High School on Maigen Road opened on the 1st. New and returning students have been enthusiastically registering at the school in recent days. At 9:00 AM yesterday, an opening ceremony was held in the school's auditorium, attended by over a hundred teachers and students. First, Principal Niu Changyao reported on the new plans for the next semester, followed by speeches from the director of discipline, Niu Xunyan, the registrar, Ren Dinghe, and teacher Zheng Fuqi. Regular classes at the school began today. There are still vacancies in various grades of the primary and secondary school departments. Students can enroll and take examinations at any time. Those with certification documents may be exempted from the entrance examination. Tuition fees may be reduced for those with financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Zhengyi Middle School: Zhengyi Middle School at 73 Moore Road opened on the 5th. In addition to the existing number of students, it is reported that fifty free places in junior high school have been specially offered to reduce the burden on students. Applications have been very enthusiastic in recent days. An examination was held on the 5th, and because the quota has not yet been filled, another examination will be held on the 10th.</p>

<p>Youyou vs. Western Merchants</p>
<p>Jinan vs. Shaguer</p>
<p>Western Police vs. Huacesi</p>
<p>This Saturday (the 10th), three Chinese teams in the Western League Division A soccer league will play simultaneously. Donghua will play Lax at Yiyuan, which is sure to be a great match. Jinan will play Shaguer at Shenyuan. It is feared that Jinan's key players will still not have returned in time, so the chances of victory are slim. Youyou will play Western Merchants at the baseball field, and Youyou should be able to secure a victory. The match between Western Police and Huacesi will be one of the most interesting scenes of the day, but unfortunately it is at the racetrack and has nothing to do with the Chinese. On Sunday, the fifth week of the Junior Cup, Youyou will play Qinghua at Hongkou Park. Youyou's B team is quite strong. They are very likely to win the C Division championship and have a chance to win the Junior Cup. Now that all the Chinese teams in Division A have lost hope, it is hoped that Youyou's B team will strive for a glimmer of glory. Encourage them! Jiangshang and the British Navy and the French Merchants will aim to complete their quest for dominance and defeat their opponents in one fell swoop. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Saturday, the 10th:</p>
<p>Jinan vs. Shaguer, Division A, Shenyuan Soccer Field</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Western Merchants, Division A, Chinese Baseball Field</p>

<h3 id="e188">World Billiards Master Smith to Show His Skills Tonight <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM against Billiards King Li Gongying</p>
<p>Location: Lianhua General Association on Beijing Road</p>
<p>Willie Smith, the world-renowned professional billiards master, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the President Jackson and is staying at the Huizhong Hotel. The Baohan Dun Club hosted a banquet to welcome him last night. Today, at 6:00 PM and 9:15 PM, he will hold exhibition matches with Shanghai amateur champion Li Gongying at the Lianhua General Association at 27 Beijing Road. The reporter visited him at his residence yesterday and had a long conversation. The details of his remarks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Addicted Since Childhood: I (Smith said himself) still remember that when I was ten and a half years old, I found billiards very fascinating. At the age of eleven, I was able to hold a cue. After following the elders, I gained some understanding of the skills and worked harder. I then associated with experts every day and learned all their secrets. Finally, I realized that my skills were comparable to those of world-class players, so I resolved to become a professional master, and today I have achieved my wish.</p>
<p>Two-Time Champion: In 1911, I transitioned from an amateur to a professional, and then traveled around the world. In 1920 and 1923, I won the British National Professional Championship twice in a row, setting a British record of 2743 points. This is my first time in China. I have long admired the prosperity of Shanghai, but since I have just unpacked my luggage, I have not yet toured the city, so it is difficult to express my feelings. Since leaving England, I have traveled through India, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, where I have competed. After completing my performances in Shanghai, I plan to return home on the 20th, as billiards players from all over the world have invited me to perform again.</p>
<p>An Honor: When I was in England, I knew that there were many Chinese students studying there who were proficient in this sport. Even during my performances on this trip, the excellent skills of the Chinese people I met always impressed me. There are especially many good players in Hong Kong. I feel very honored to be competing with the masters among the Chinese in Shanghai this time.</p>
<p>Eight Performances: Willie Smith will give eight performances in Shanghai. The Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association has specially commissioned the Englishman Mr. Bernal to select representatives to participate in the performances. Four Chinese players have been selected: Li Gongying, Shen Lince, Liu Fuzong, and Xu Shizhang, as well as the Portuguese player Medina Campos, and the Englishman Botto. There will be two sessions per day, the first session starting at 6:00 PM and the second session starting at 9:15 PM. Reserved seat tickets are three yuan per session and five yuan for two sessions. Non-reserved seat tickets are two yuan per session and three yuan for two sessions. The performance schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>April 4th: 6:00 PM, Li Gongying; 9:15 PM, Li Gongying</p>
<p>April 5th: 6:00 PM, Shen Lince; 9:15 PM, Xu Shizhang</p>
<p>April 6th: 6:00 PM, Liu Fuzong; 9:15 PM, Campos</p>
<p>April 7th: 6:00 PM, Botto; 9:15 PM, Medina</p>
<h3 id="e189">Zhanghua Defeats Qingguang, Tongji Loses to Yonggan <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>| Five Matches Tonight |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association is Dull. The Western Youth Yonggan Basketball Team, as reporters have repeatedly said, has mediocre individual skills, but can cleverly use tactics and repeatedly achieve success, which should not be ignored. Among the fourteen teams in Division A of the Shanghai Basketball Association, there are many who can defeat Yonggan, but the team's lack of qualifications, its excellent spirit, as well as the refreshing style of play and clever tactics are unmatched by any other team. In the game against Tongji last night, Yonggan had smooth sailing, leading 20-14 in the first half, and the final result was 37-23, showing the depth of their skills. The stone of other hills can polish jade. The Chinese teams can learn from it. Zhanghua and Qingguang have a long-standing feud that cannot be resolved. Every time they meet, there is no good result. There is open and secret fighting, each showing (wrestling) skills. Qingguang's heroic era is over, so they are no match for Zhanghua. The first half was 37-18, and the final score was 70-36. When Zhanghua's Qian Jingyong was ejected after committing his fourth foul at 66-32, he only fought with four players. The B team Qi Team defeated Meitong 25-22. Tonight's schedule has five games, three in Division A, which are likely to be one-sided, and the audience is sparse. Last night's results and tonight's schedule are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e191">Jiaotong University and Beining Railway <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>| Ended with a 0-0 Draw | (Tianjin News) |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiaotong University football team's winter vacation tour northwards. At the end of last month, they arrived in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Of the two matches against Fu Jen and Qinghua, they had one loss and one draw. On the 1st of this month, the whole team took a train at 2:00 PM and arrived in Tianjin at about 5:00 PM that evening, lodging at the Rotary Middle School. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a special match was arranged at the Beining field against the Beining football team, the first match in Tianjin. Mr. Hou Luoxun was invited as the referee.</p>
<p>Match Situation: Both armies had changes in their lineups yesterday. Jiaotong University's Shen Guanlan and Wen Liandong were feeling unwell, so Shao Jihua was replaced as center back, and Gong Yibin as forward. Beining's Sun Fulai was absent, and Sun Guilin was changed to forward, with Pike filling the original position. When the whistle sounded on time, the deputy director of Beining performed the kickoff ceremony, and the charge began. Jiaotong University's front army had excellent communication and repeatedly invaded the enemy camp. Beining's defense was tight. Wang Baoshu showed his skills, and Sun Sijing was a one-man barrier, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. Veteran Pike was also quite brave and good at fighting. The front army quickly launched joint attacks, but missed several opportunities. At the end of the first half, neither side had scored. After the break, they changed positions and faced each other. Both sides were eager to attack, and the battle became more intense. Jiaotong University's Zhou Guangzhong and Wan Xianghua made several attempts to break through, but goalkeeper Chen Erde easily chased them down with his agility. Beining then attacked the enemy. Jiang Lu was extremely active. Jiaotong University's Wang Changying's crazy spirit was as strong as ever. In this battle, he was indeed Jiang Lu's strong opponent. There were two dangerous situations in front of the goal, but goalkeeper Fan Jiaju handled them well. Beining's Liu Zhongyuan was weak and missed the opportunity. When the whole game ended, both sides maintained a 0-0 tie, and they ended the battle with cheers.</p>
<p>Banquet: At about 7:00 PM that evening, the Beining Sports Association specially held a banquet at the main station cafeteria for the entire Jiaotong University team, and invited Mr. Hou Luosun and the press, as well as members of the association, to accompany them. During the banquet, Mr. Ma Yimin, the chairman of the association, gave a welcome speech, saying that it was a rare opportunity to have all the heroes gathered together. Jiaotong University and Beining are essentially one family, and those present are also close neighbors. He hoped that they would not be polite and would enjoy the meal. Then, the representative of the Jiaotong University team stood up and gave a speech, briefly saying that the Chinese people are only interested in sports during their student years, and when they enter society, they are separated from sports. However, the Beining Sports Association is enthusiastically carrying out its activities in this situation. We believe that the development of sports is closely related to the strength of a country. We hope that Beining will promote its spirit and guide social sports. The dinner lasted until 8:30 PM, when everyone dispersed in joy. The team will rest today, and at 2:30 PM tomorrow afternoon, they will play their second match in Tianjin against the Chinese team at the Nankai Middle School field. Tickets are available in two types, 10 cents and 20 cents. The lineups of both sides yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Team: Chen Yong, Chen Gongyu, Li Beiliang, Wan Xianghua, Fan Yiju, Wang Changying, Shao Jihua, Zhou Guangzhong, Zhang Jinyu, Gong Yibin, Xue Wenxiu</p>
<p>Beining Team: Jiang Lu, Zhang Guren, Sun Yating, Sun Guicai, Chen Erde, Wang Baoye, Sun Sijing, Liu Zhongyuan, Wu Shen, Qin Ming, Zhang Zhixian</p>

<h3 id="e193">Parrot Island and Parrots <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ming</p>
<p>Some time ago, it was reported that a large fire broke out on Parrot Island in Hankou, burning down more than 500 thatched cottages. This news has nothing to do with those who live in Shanghai洋房 (Western-style houses), but it makes one think of some old stories. || It is said that Parrot Island gets its name not because of the grass (芳草萋萋), but because a famous scholar was killed there || Zhengping. Those who have read Romance of the Three Kingdoms must know that this gentleman once beat a drum and scolded Cao Mengde. That is not credible. However, Cao Cao hated him very much and wanted to kill him, but fearing that he would ruin his own reputation, he sent him to Liu Biao. Liu Biao also hated him very much, probably because he was too proud, and was afraid of incurring a bad name (So he sent Heng to Huang Zu, the Governor of Jiangxia, who was impetuous). Later, the (impetuous) one really acted like a fool and killed him. He was 26 years old when he died.</p>
<p>Why were they so polite? Probably because at that time, the government and the public cherished young people with literary talent. It is a pity that he was a (rather obey and stay away from danger, rather not disobey and lose his life) person, like a parrot. And he did not know that once he entered the cage, there would be (no day to open the cage).</p>
<p>Not only was Mi Heng like this, but many scholars throughout history have been like parrots. They also speak human language, learn to sing, and may even understand a little bit of (the art of scolding people), but (they don't leave birds), (green clothes and jade collars) are not always pleasing to people. The parrot in Dream of the Red Chamber is hated by the maids. Of course, it's just a bird. But some parrots may love freedom. There was such a story before ||</p>
<p>Someone kept a parrot. One day, he met a monk, and the parrot asked him how to get out of the cage. The monk said harshly, (If you ask about the day you get out of the cage, unless your feet are straight!) The parrot heard this and suddenly got angry and died. The owner was very sad and blamed the monk for meddling, so he took it out and buried it. When he opened the cage, it flew away.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Thinking of Wandering <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Although it was a long time ago, it still makes me yearn when I think about it now.</p>
<p>Wearing my pattering wooden clogs, taking advantage of the fine rain, on a misty autumn morning, I boarded the southward bound ship on the Irrawaddy River and left Bhamo. Seeing the willows standing gracefully in the misty rain on both banks, gradually receding, blurring, and disappearing in the mist, the joy of traveling and wandering floated vividly and strongly in my heart. Even now, I still think that getting on that journey was the most unforgettable pleasure in my life.</p>
<p>Because before, in the spring, I had wanted to rely on this southern river to go to a more distant place, but I was forced by life to the point where it was difficult to even stay in Bhamo. Finally, I was forced back to the Neren Mountain in the north to spend the hard days of sweeping horse manure, and spent a full five months.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, if there had been no such experience, then the interest in gazing at the exotic rain scene from the deck of the ship would not have been so strong or so heavy. Therefore, I can say that impoverished wandering is more interesting and particularly nostalgic than affluent travel. But this requires a person with a long-term depressed mood to appreciate this meaning - if he has not actually wandered.</p>
<p>Chekhov, who is good at writing about the depression of intellectuals, I think, his mood must have been extremely depressed, right? Bunin, who won the Nobel Prize last year, once described that before he died, Chekhov often said loudly in his sleep (become a wanderer, a pilgrim, go to those holy places, live in temples, forests, lakesides; on summer evenings, sit on a bench in front of a Muslim church···). What a longing for wandering!</p>
<p>I myself traveled from Sichuan to Myanmar entirely on bare feet, walking those difficult Yunnan mountain roads, and in Kunming and Yangon, I had the misery of being evicted from the store for failing to pay the rent. In reason, whether in terms of mood or body, I should be tired of wandering. But now, when I mention wandering, I still yearn for it, and feel that it is the most enchanting thing in life. Why? I don't know. Perhaps this is because the heavy depression is still deeply pressing on my heart? However, when I think about the time when I should give up this kind of personal pleasure, the beautiful lakes and mountains in the distance, and the unknown grasslands, I have no choice but to let them lie idle at the end of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Momentous Occasion <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Mengke</p>
<p>Snow was flying, and the weather was very cold.</p>
<p>Although this auditorium was small, it was created by combining a classroom, and it still managed to fit three hundred desks. The doodles of female students' faces and legs, carelessly drawn on the desks with pencils, were, exceptionally, washed off by the school janitor with several buckets of water. The left corner of each desk also had a numbered sticker, neatly affixed. Usually, there were no stoves in the classrooms, but today there were not only stoves but as many as three. Once the windows were closed, the heat became overwhelming; even after taking off one's coat, one still felt bloated. If it weren't for the snow flying outside, we might have suspected that spring had arrived. The school authorities had gone to such lengths to prepare the examination hall; even if one couldn't call it magnificent, in our hearts, we all thought it was more than adequate. What's more, what flags and portraits had been newly added to the whitewashed wall behind the podium?</p>
<p>Before the bell rang, the students were already rushing in, vying to be first. In Shanghai's universities, there were few students as enthusiastic about exams as these. We were remarkably relaxed and calm, huddled tightly around the three stoves: chatting, laughing, bickering, even fighting. In short, as far as exams were concerned, we were supremely confident.</p>
<p>Yes, we were indeed confident about the exams. When the bell rang, we went to our assigned seats (according to our numbers), opened our inkstones, and dipped our brushes. Each of us took out a draft we had prepared a week earlier. We continued to chat and laugh, calmly waiting for the mimeographed questions and answer sheets to be distributed so we could begin our work.</p>
<p>The proctor—the Dean of Academic Affairs, Mr. Liu, with his beard—specially donned a cyan silk mandarin jacket, carried a stack of exam papers, stroked his walrus mustache, and walked in heavily. He stood silently by the door for two or three minutes, scrutinizing the various faces, before pacing over and carefully distributing the questions and answer sheets according to the seat numbers. He put on a stern face and warned: (Work carefully; the papers are not allowed to be swapped.)</p>
<p>The exam then began, and the atmosphere became tense. Mr. Liu paced heavily back and forth in silence. When he spotted laughter on one side, he rushed over, glared, and issued a warning: (Um...). Suddenly, several faces appeared pressed against the glass windows of the examination hall, emitting suppressed laughter. This greatly angered Mr. Liu, who quickly shouted: (Hey! What are you looking at?) But this was not only ineffective; the number of faces gradually increased, and the laughter became even louder. Although Mr. Liu was very solemn, he was ultimately helpless against these faces and could only randomly ask: (What's your name?) (Which department are you in?)</p>
<p>It was no wonder Mr. Liu was angry. The current term exam had become a most momentous occasion; how could he allow students from other departments to disrupt it! In the past, he would have let them make as much noise as they wanted, but now the school had just been registered; if the Ministry found out, that would be terrible. We all sympathized with Mr. Liu. In the tense atmosphere, we could even cheer up and quickly finish the exam so we could return to the stoves to chat. Now that they were making such a racket, our thoughts were distracted. If our essays hadn't been prepared so short, we probably wouldn't even be able to finish copying them! The exam ended in less than half an hour. Mr. Liu carefully collected the papers according to the numbers, stroked his walrus mustache, and heavily paced out the door. We huddled around the three stoves again, and the students who had been idle outside, with their frozen, rosy faces, squeezed in.</p>
<p>Snow was flying, and the weather was very cold.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Liang Rengong in Hunan (3) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Liang Rengong's writing style also had a great impact in Hunan. In those days, who didn't enjoy reading the articles in the *Shiwu Bao* (Current Affairs)? Even the old-fashioned scholars had no objections. But because Liang Rengong went to Hunan to lecture, and new Hunan figures published *Xiangxue Bao* (Hunan Studies) and *Xiang Bao* (Hunan News), this incurred the great resentment of the old Hunan scholars. Therefore, in his letter to Ye Dehui, Pi Xirui said:</p>
<p>"Literary men despise each other; this has been the case since ancient times. The people of Hunan lack regional solidarity and enjoy attacking each other. They praise the *Shiwu Bao* but denigrate the *Xiangxue Bao*; the criticisms of *Xiang Bao* are even more severe. The ingrained habits of the Hunan people are not surprising."</p>
<p>It turned out that Mr. Ye was a leader of the old faction who attacked the new faction. It wasn't enough for him to attack the ideas of the Kang-Liang faction; he also wanted to attack their writing style. In his letter to Mr. Pi, he said: "The writing style of the times has long been criticized by the learned. The learned are often unable to write in that style; those with high talent and broad learning are trapped in their studies, while those who speculate and imitate achieve success. But if we replace the style with policy essays, the drawbacks would be the same. Don't you see today's exam papers, filled with nothing but words like 'starting point,' 'pressure,' and 'thermal power'? It's all empty talk; why invite such ridicule!"</p>
<p>He attacked the policy essays in the new style for merely using new terms and being just as empty as the eight-legged essay. He also said in a letter to a friend: "What is most ridiculous is that they exhaust their pens and tongues, calling themselves 'Zhi Na' (China); they always say 'starting point' as the first basis. They don't consider that 'Zhi Na' is the Buddhist term for Tang China, and 'starting point' is the interpreter's term for calculation. In terms of language, it is translated into words; in terms of writing, it is spelled out into characters. It is neither writing nor substance, neither Chinese nor Western. Is this not Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi, inviting the laughter of the neighboring girls?"</p>
<p>This was also an attack on articles using new terminology. Moreover, the Hunan Provincial Academy Covenant, in the article "Distinguishing Writing Styles," said:</p>
<p>"The court believes that the accumulated abuses of the eight-legged essay are too deep, so it has changed the exam to policy essays. However, the policy essays in the examination hall do not involve scholarship; those who can write well control them, and their abuses are probably even worse than those of the eight-legged essay. Looking at the works published in the *Xiang Bao*, such as 'thermal power,' 'expansion power,' 'love power,' 'absorption power,' 'attraction power,' 'pressure,' 'Zhi Na,' 'Zhendan,' 'starting point,' 'forming lines,' 'blood wheel,' 'brain,' 'soul,' 'ether,' 'yellow race,' 'white race,' '400 million people,' etc., they come as soon as the pen moves. Some people like to use all kinds of obscure and strange words, and one becomes breathless before finishing a single chapter." It can be seen that more than thirty years ago, the use of new terms in articles by the new faction was the most hated thing by the old faction scholars. At that time, the popularity of this new writing style in Hunan could be said to have been brought by Liang Rengong. It was no wonder that a group of old-faction scholars in Hunan, who had started with the eight-legged essay, were both jealous and indignant that the Examination Commissioner Xu actually used this style of writing to select scholars.</p>
<p>Liang Rengong once said that his own writing (always carried emotion in the pen), which was true. He was a political commentator, and the emotion in his pen was one of the factors that allowed his political commentary to sweep the world. This kind of writing, suitable for agitation, was brought to Hunan. A tribute student learned it very well. This person was called Fan Chui, from Shaoyang. He published some articles in the *Xiang Bao*. The most attacked article by the old faction was titled "Sincerity," which said:</p>
<p>"The people have been foolish for too long, and they have not seen the light of day for too long. Those above use this to fool them, and those below passively accept it. For two thousand years, it has penetrated their muscles and soaked into their marrow, shackling their dreams and imprisoning their souls, reveling in the sea of suffering and hell, galloping in the land of drunken life and nightmare death, binding them, trampling on them, like cattle and horses, like moss."</p>
<p>This was a scathing denunciation of the policy of fooling the people for more than two thousand years, and the thought was rather unstable. It also said: "Now it is appropriate that from the officials to the commoners, all should be like this, gathered together in one room, confined and closed, so that they do not see the sun and the moon, and are not covered by the earth." How thorough was this way of dealing with corrupt officials! His arguments were even more radical. He also said: "Therefore, I wish that His Majesty would wield a five-inch pipe, half a pool of ink, without asking anyone, without consulting the masses, and issue an edict that must be carried out. It should say, 'Now that things have come to this, danger is imminent, although there is a present, it is useless. Rather than dissecting and dismembering, giving every inch to others, where can we moor our carriage, and there is no way to reach the sky. It is better to take advantage of the fact that it is not yet rotten and make it public to the world. Let me be finished!'"</p>
<p>His argument was truly bold. No wonder the old faction rebuked him, saying: "The emperor's edict, how dare subjects presume to imitate it, let alone utter such rebellious words! The national laws are in place; cutting him into pieces, inch by inch, is not enough to cover his guilt." He also said in the article:</p>
<p>"Wash away the old habits, follow justice, then all the complicated rituals, the despicable nobility, the evil examples and inferior models of civil and military fame, the erroneous clauses and chaotic chapters of selection files, major political laws, universal constitutions and equal laws, schools for the four peoples, customs and folk customs, all must be changed from the past, and searched without leaving anything behind, only the West is the model, using Confucius's era for dating."</p>
<p>How could such a thorough transformation and reform be achieved at that time? But he could not help but advocate it. He was the extreme new faction in Hunan. He was more thorough than Liang Rengong's ideas, and his arguments were more radical than Liang Rengong's. He fully demonstrated the extreme characteristics of the Hunan people. However, he was the person most deeply influenced by Liang Rengong.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous to say. Around the year of the Wuxu Reform (1898), Liang Rengong was too new; around the year of the Xinhai Revolution (1911), Liang Rengong was old again; around the time of the May Fourth Movement (1919), Liang Rengong (running after the younger generation) couldn't catch up. This great era was a bit of a trickster. Although the times are always moving forward, if people don't stand before the times, they fall behind the times. Is there anything surprising about that?</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Wet Nurse (4) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>(He suddenly started to cry.) She lowered her head in shame.</p>
<p>(The child is crying, and still I don't hear you making a sound. Are you asleep?)</p>
<p>(No, Madam, I am awake.) (Why don't you hum him to sleep? This child has a temper; if you hum for a while, he will stop crying.) The Madam said. After thinking for a moment, she asked: (Can you hum a little tune?)</p>
<p>(I can't.) (Like this, (Hum, hum, little darling, go to sleep, hum, hum...) can't you do that? Truly a country person; when the child cries, you don't even make a sound...)</p>
<p>After that, on quiet evenings, when the child was crying, one could hear the wet nurse humming in her coarse voice: (Hum, hum, little darling,</p>
<p>go to sleep, hum, hum...)</p>
<p>(5) The wet nurse had been in her home for one month, lacking only four days, precisely one hundred days after the child was born into this world. They were preparing to host a banquet for the child. Two days before, the Madam said to the wet nurse: (The day after tomorrow is the child's hundredth day; we're planning to have a feast and invite many relatives and friends to shave the child's head!) The clear-faced, thin child had only been by the wet nurse's side for more than twenty days, and having drunk her milk, he was as plump as a vegetable in a garden after fine rain. The child was very lively and lovable, with dark eyes and a high, carp-backed nose. That day, the child had his head shaved and wore a new blue checkered outfit that harmonized with the colors of early summer. A silver neck chain hung with a string of silver bells, and with the slightest movement, it would ring (jingle).</p>
<p>The aunts, the Madam's younger sister, the Madam's old classmates living in the city, and some female guests had all arrived. Each of them, upon arriving and without sitting down, asked with great concern: (Where is the young master?) The wet nurse hid in the room with the child, as if she was afraid of seeing the guests. Today, the child was dressed up, and the wet nurse had also dressed up, with powder on her face and the female cook having trimmed her face. She wore the white bamboo cloth short shirt and pants. She was called by the Madam from the room into the living room filled with guests, holding the child for the guests to see. They took turns praising the child: (The child is so lovable, with a high nose like his father.) Someone would then chime in: (And a pair of dark eyes just like his mother!)</p>

<p>Trading Disorderly, Continues to Fall Four Dollars Forty Cents</p>
<p>The gold market is still in flux, weakening and strengthening, advancing and retreating unpredictably, with no excessive fluctuations, at most two or three yuan range bound. The maximum price of the day was $700.007, and the minimum price was $694, a difference of $6.70. Trading at various firms was bustling, but there was still no huge volume. As a result, compared with last Saturday, it continued to fall $4.40. It initially rebounded to the $700 level, calculated at $695.80, due to reports of gains in large silver and the New York Metals Exchange's silver futures soaring by 100 to 136 pounds. Exchange rates also rose from 0.2425 to 0.2525. Although the settlement price for British gold has changed, there is indeed a relationship. (Therefore, $691 was seen before the market opened.) Afterwards, although foreign exchange has been increased, the domestic market has changed from loose to stable, headge accounts settled British silver accounts to US dollars accounts, and the market has a better outlook. Buyers are still enthusiastic, and the price has risen in circles, from $694 in the morning to over $699 by noon. By closing time, it had fallen slightly, calculated at $697.50. In the aftermarket, it was initially stable, but later, due to rumors that the British and American exchange rates were still difficult to stabilize, it fell slightly before recovering due to the stability of foreign exchange. Also, large accounts partially covered short positions, and had exceeded the $700 mark before closing at $699.90 (however, the after-hours trading immediately violated $701 or more, and the opening and closing prices of the day rose by $4.10). British gold settled at plus $0.125, US dollars settled at plus 0.25 to 0.375, and the number of March contracts decreased by about 2,000. The details of the whole day are recorded below. In the morning, March opened down $8.50, calculated at $695.80 (before the market opened, it was initially $691-692, followed by a premium of more than $2, and then the buying was active, bringing the opening price to nearly $695-696, with a lot of trading at various firms). Heng Yu, Yuan Chun, Da Chang, Xiang, Shun Li, Qing Fa, Yong Da, Xing Yong, Chang Sheng, Zhao Feng, Chang Yi, Cheng Hong Xing and others all advanced. Wai Xiang first sold June British gold at $0.075, immediately dropping to $694. Then banks adsorbed June US dollars at half a dollar, May at 0.375. Afterwards, fellow traders rushed to liquidate, with May only calculated at 0.25 to 0.1875. Hui Xiang, Tai Chang, Da Xing, Yong Yuan Chun, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong and others came to advance, gradually rising by $4, to $698.70 at 9:30. HSBC's listed price increased by 0.25, US dollars by 0.75, but there was no great impact, at $696.80, because there seemed to be more buyers, and the domestic market was not loose. The April price settled at $634, and it was not easy to obtain. Gan Chang, Xiang Chang Sheng, Yong Yi, Yu Lai advanced, and at 9:45, it was $698.30. Later, Yuan Chun, Si Da, Run Chang, Yu Yi, Feng Yong, Shun Li, Yong Xing and others sold, and at 10:20, it was $696. Then it was rumored that the silver price should have a small rebound, and people's hearts were shaken. At 11:00, it was $699.50. HSBC absorbed February British gold at 0.4375, and Mai Hang absorbed May at 0.625. Afterwards, Chang Sheng Yong, Da Fa, Yong Heng, Yu Da, and Lian Bang all came out, returning to $697.70. Heng Yu, Hong Xing, Fu Yu, and Yuan Chun advanced again, and at 11:30, it reached $699.70. Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Wan Xing Yong, and De Yong all came out. Wai Bi released June US dollars at 0.25, Hua Qi released February at 0.75, and then the lunch closed at $697.50 (goods at $697.80).</p>
<p>The aftermarket opened at $697, Yi Feng, Yong Hong Xing, and Wan Xing came to advance, and it was $698.50. Fu Chang and Heng Yu, Fu Yu, and others escaped. Then it was rumored that the British and American exchange rates could not be stabilized, and people's hearts were frustrated, resulting in $696.40. Later, Bing Xing and Yuan Chun bought in, and after 2:30, it was $698.20. Yuan Mao Yong sold on the market, and after 3:00, it was $697, Yi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng Hong Xing, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong and others rushed to buy, and the price jumped up. However, Hui Xiang Chang Sheng Yong and small accounts came out, with a slight price consolidation, and by 4:15, it had broken through the upper limit, with Yuan Mao Yong Fu Yu, Heng Yu and others continuing to advance strongly, and the exchange market also rose. Zhejiang sold to the Central Bank March at $33.8125, and the gold price reached $700.007, until the close at 4:30, $699.50, while Lian Bang and others came out. However, after closing, the buying continued to be strong, and $701.50 was seen (goods auctioned at $701.20).</p>
<p>Spot red bars suddenly fell back, because the buying trend of the Tianjin gang had stopped, and they had returned to sell, resulting in $1,130. However, the inflow and outflow of spot goods at various firms was inconsistent. It is reported that $1,120 had been traded the day before, which was sold by the Tianjin gang. Decorative gold was also reduced by $2, calculated at $116.50. The listed price increased British gold by $0.25, so it was changed to about $711, calculated at $13 or $14, to $11, and in the afternoon, $14 to over $10, which was $7 or $8 less than last Saturday. Registered price for February was $12, March $698, replenishment $12, and $14 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Trading on the counter was divergent, with Heng Yu Yuan Chun Da Chang Xiang Shun Li Qing Fa Yong Da Xing Yong Chang Sheng Zhao Feng Chang Yi Cheng Hong Xing all advancing, Hui Xiang Wu went in after initially selling, Wan Xing Rui Kang Heng Chang Yong Fu Yu Yi Feng Yong Fu Tai Heng Yi Da Yong Si Da Nei Xing Yuan Mao Yong Da Fa Yong Yong De all coming out, in the afternoon Yuan Mao Yong Yuan Chun Yi Feng Yong Yi Cheng Zhi Feng Yong Hong Xing Bing Xing Zhao Feng Chang Fu Yu all advancing, Heng Yu slightly liquidated out, Fu Chang Heng Xing Yuan Yong Feng Wan Xing Shun Li all coming out, and Wai Xiang Da De Cheng had mixed inflow and outflow of goods. Da Lian Bang liquidated a total of 2,500 or 2,600 bars, advancing more than 1,200 bars, and Guang Bang Heng Xing had a small number of inflows and outflows, which was trading on behalf of customers. The number of transactions on the day totaled 31,206 bars in the morning and 9,177 bars in the afternoon. As of today, the total number of March shares is 30,884, with a total of 31 bulls and 62 bears.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silver market was without telegrams, but the day before, British and American exchange rates and exchange rates had risen, and the local foreign exchange market was slightly affected, clearly and secretly lengthened, but the state of change was from loose to loose.

The internal market was calculated to have increased British gold by 0.125, and gold firms sold, with many banks doing business with each other, totaling about 200,000 pounds, and the situation was lively. The US dollar was initially loose at $0.375, then June could settle at $34.50, May at 0.3125 to 0.375, and then it was stable again, with June only calculated at 0.125, and May at 0.0625, and Chinese merchants rushed to settle accounts. The afternoon was especially tight, but trading was not as smooth as in the morning. The opening and closing of the day shrunk by 0.125, but the forward price was flat. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the recent price was lengthened by 0.25, and the forward price was lengthened by 0.3125 to 0.375, and it had returned to above $34.

<h3 id="e200">Silver Coin Position Excess, Foreign Currency Break Opened for White Borrowing <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency discount market price surprisingly saw cash concentration. The excess cash position, combined with the overall closing relationship, led to a scarcity of supply, resulting in an egregious oversupply. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened for white borrowing, with very little trading. The situation was extremely loose, and the headliner was also white-washed without adding water. Banks also had many positions and no way to place them. The amount of cash positions in the financial sector was rarely seen in previous years. The bill discount transaction only had 2.78 million in the morning transfer and more than 500,000 in new transactions. The afternoon had 300,000 to 400,000 transactions, and the small general meeting had more than 500,000 transactions. Foreign currency mortgage loan transactions were also returning more and doing less due to the closing relationship, with redemption loans totaling more than 1.3 million and new loans totaling 800,000 to 900,000. The total cash notes retrieved and issued were only 1.3 to 1.4 million. The customer source totaled 350,000, which was purely a repatriation of funds, removing 150,000 in new currency from Zhenjiang to relieve the stomach. The bank received silver loan notes of more than 100,000 and more than 2.9 million in foreign currency, various freight exchange mortgage loans, tax and miscellaneous loans of more than 2.2 million and more than 5.78 million in foreign currency, settlement loans of more than 1.1 million and more than 3.5 million in foreign currency, special loans of more than 1.3 million and more than 560,000 in foreign currency, silver withdrawn from the warehouse was 500,000 and 800,000 in foreign currency. Chinese banks received more than 4.7 million in silver loan notes, more than 4.5 million in settlement loans, more than 2.9 million in special loans, various freight exchange mortgage loans, tax and miscellaneous loans of more than 5.6 million, and more than 500,000 withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese banks received more than 500,000 in settlement loans and more than 2.3 million in foreign currency, silver deposited in the warehouse was 400,000 and 600,000 in foreign currency. The money shops received more than 45 million in foreign currency loans and more than 940,000 in foreign currency transfer loans, customer exchange loans were more than 40,000, and the cash received was 300,000 to 400,000. The total number of exchanges at the local clearing house on the 5th was 9,732,861 yuan, 6 jiao and 3 fen, including 4,897,547 yuan and 7 fen in silver yuan and 4,835,314 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 fen in foreign currency transfer.</p>

<p>Jiangnan small silver coins have fluctuated greatly in recent days, and have not yet recovered yesterday. The morning market fell by 5 yuan, to 850 yuan, and the afternoon market rose by 4 yuan, to 854 yuan. As a result, it was changed by 1 yuan compared to the afternoon market the day before, and a transaction was made. The morning market had 6,000 jiao, and the afternoon market had 5,500 jiao. Guangdong small silver coins were 784 yuan and 8 jiao in the morning market and 784 yuan and 4 jiao in the afternoon market. As a result, it was small by 4 jiao, and a transaction was made. The morning market had 90,000 jiao, and the afternoon market had 60,000 jiao. Copper coins were changed by 1,000 wen, to 292,000 wen. There were 35,040 strings of transactions, totaling 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>｜Pre-Closing Situation Comparatively Firm｜</p>
<p>｜Stock Exchange Closed for Nine Days Starting from the 10th｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market initially remained chaotic, but showed signs of strengthening. The market slightly improved at closing, and the trend is unlikely to reverse in the short term. However, there are unlikely to be major fluctuations before the Lunar New Year. Short sellers, finding no way out, are slightly covering their positions, but most are patiently waiting for opportunities, remaining in a wait-and-see state. Sharp rises in market prices will inevitably be followed by sudden drops. A slow, gradual increase is not in the interest of short sellers, but only sudden rises and drops can shake the defenses of both sides. A long period of brewing will lead to significant changes. Yesterday’s trading appeared chaotic and uncertain on the surface, with very slight fluctuations. After the afternoon closing, the upward trend was relatively firm. In the morning sessions and at the opening of the afternoon session, prices saw mixed ups and downs, but each session had more gains than losses, by about five cents to twelve cents. Notably, the No. 75 short positions were covered, and No. 64 saw considerable buying interest. Other transactions were not very active, with retail investors dominating trading, and arbitrage transactions were limited. As a result, market prices improved slightly by five cents to forty-five cents. Among these, the forward contracts for One Nine Dragon and One Nine Good Twenty fluctuated slightly, decreasing by five cents to one and a half cents. However, the 22nd Year Customs Bonds suddenly fell by more than one dollar and twenty cents. Regarding this type of treasury bond trading, the reporter believes it has not yet entered the right track. The total turnover was 11,393,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures included 3,890,000 yuan in unified salt tax, 1,700,500 yuan in disarmament bonds, 550,000 yuan in 19 Customs Bonds, 2,120,000 yuan in 20/20 bonds, 1,790,000 yuan in gold short contracts, 740,000 yuan in 96 contracts, and the remainder ranged from 120,000 yuan to over 200,000 yuan. The market announced that it would be closed for seven days from February 10th to 17th, with a regular Sunday holiday on the 18th. Normal business would resume on the 19th.</p>
<h3 id="e203">New York Stock Market Active and Trending Higher <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from New Asia Trading Company, on the 3rd, the New York stock market rose several cents to two dollars. Trading was extremely active, driven by excellent reports from the automotive and steel industries. The New York City bank clearinghouse saw a sharp increase in exchange amounts, and a portion of cotton sales exceeded 60% of production. Bonds were also active and slightly higher. Half-day trading volume reached 2,081,170 shares. Wheat prices rose by a little over one cent due to short covering. Spot prices were strong, and the market has the potential for a sharp rise. Cotton spot prices remained tight, and the large volume of outstanding orders from yarn factories strengthened the market. Reductions in cotton acreage and continued commercial progress are key factors determining market prices in the long term. Brokers generally have bullish views, and the market is firm. The Dow Jones Averages are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weak due to sluggish real demand, a depressed economy, and commercial decline, leading to a lack of enthusiasm. While overseas cotton markets are rising, exchange rates are extended, easing the market somewhat. However, higher cotton prices are creating difficulties for factories. There are expectations that some factories may reduce production. There was some buying of long-term contracts, taking long positions.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn Falls:</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session of the People's Standard Yarn market, rumors circulated that short sellers were delivering yarn, causing a sudden drop in the market, with prices falling by six cents across all months. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their short positions, causing prices to rise by two or three cents across all months. Total turnover for the day was 6,750 bales. Of these, Shenchang sold 350 bales, Changji 300 bales, Ruidash 550 bales, Renfeng 300 bales, and Changfeng 500 bales, Tonghe 300 bales. Dachan bought 1,250 bales, Yuli 250 bales, Dafeng 350 bales, Zhenda 350 bales, and Yuanda 200 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. US cotton continued to rise. The reason given was that the reduction in planting was particularly severe, and there was concern that prices would continue to rise. As a result, one short seller covered a large number of positions, while Yuanda continued to sell and add to short positions when prices rose. The bulls and bears were evenly matched. However, falling gold prices and rising exchange rates made the market slightly weak. In terms of foreign cotton, there is an expectation of rising prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Market Lowers in the Morning and Recovers in the Afternoon:</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session of the Zheng Standard Cotton market, although foreign cotton rose,</p>
<p>and gold prices fell back, prices fell by five cents to two cents across all months. In the afternoon, Ruidash covered its short positions, causing prices to rise by five cents to two cents across all months. Total turnover for the day was 47,700 dan. Of these, Jifeng sold 1,000 dan, Tongfu 1,700 dan, Yukang 2,000 dan, Zhenda 1,100 dan, Hengde 1,100 dan, Renfeng 1,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,200 dan, Chungi 1,300 dan, and Yuanda 1,600 dan.

<p>After a round of bull market closures and sales by Japanese traders last week, prices rebounded due to positive news from Liverpool. At the same time, rising US cotton prices also helped the actual situation. Re-exporters had a large number of unfilled orders for Luoqi cotton, so local speculators took the opportunity to raise market prices. In terms of spot goods, Europe bought quite a bit at the beginning of the week, while Japanese traders were hesitant. Shipments to China were still good. Arrivals of Oumula cotton were congested, and European and local factories found it difficult to absorb them all. The weekly statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening of the morning session, market conditions for all months were consistently strong. Foreign wheat quotes: Chicago rose by about 34 cents, Canada rose by 45 cents. Therefore, after the opening price, market sentiment in all months was unusually firm. January to March became gradually more active with more speculators. Speculators deliberately pushed up prices, significantly better than the previous week. By the fourth session in the afternoon, market sentiment remained high. This month's price reached a high of two yuan and two cents, while March and April also reached a high of two yuan, one cent and nine and a half cents. Then, factories suddenly came out to sell off, causing market sentiment to fall back by one or two cents. However, long-term contracts remained steady due to very thin trading. As a result, this month remained unchanged, March fell by 7.5%, April fell by 1%, May fell by 5%, June rose by 5%, and July rose by 1.5%. Spot wheat: Fuxin sold 776 bags of Yaowan wheat for 4.1 yuan, and Jiangxi wheat for 3.86 yuan. In addition, Fufeng sold two ships of US wheat from the government, and Huafeng sold 1,000 tons, both at a price of 4.25 yuan.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over fifty sources from various groups (over 7,000 stones) showed signs of weakness at the opening. Local shops took little interest, and there was no improvement until near noon. Regular groups such as Su Tong's japonica continued to fall by 5 cents, and Du Yangjian also fell by nearly 10 cents. Various groups of late rice, from Northern Ocean, Tianjin, Tanggu and other groups,</p>
<p>progressively traded over three thousand bags, and the market slightly turned around, but the price only increased by two cents. Yin Bianyuan had no wide outlets, and its shape and color were fatigued, causing the price to fall by around 10 cents. Furthermore, according to a joint resolution by the Shanghai Northern and Southern Rice Groups, the market will close on the 9th of this month to facilitate a major settlement, and a group worship ceremony will be held on the 18th. The reopening date will be discussed and announced at the meeting on the 18th. (North Shanghai) Thirty-two or three shipments from various routes arrived, but the market remained stagnant. Bagged rice was discounted to stimulate movement. Few transactions were made by each household. High-quality white japonica was flat and weak, and medium-grade rice was discounted by around 10 cents. Du Jian, Bo Dao, Early Rice, and Ke Jian were stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice was approaching the end of the Lunar New Year, and all parties were seeking to close positions. Both arrivals and sales were low, and inventories were slightly higher. Vendors wanted to hold until the red market next spring and were currently unwilling to sell. While outlets in Fuzhou had stopped, Quanzhou was still interested, but due to depleted floating stocks, trading was not smooth. In the unified market, only 150 bags of Jiangbei machine-milled Xian rice were sold to Quanzhou, with the price at 7 yuan, one yuan higher than the previous market. There were no other transactions. However, there were still ample stocks of foreign rice in the market. Yesterday, a Zhejiang group inquired, and it is likely that there will be some direct allocations during the Lunar New Year.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous grains and oil cake businesses are mostly closing down due to the approaching end of the lunar year. Therefore, the market in the Miscellaneous Grains Association and the Caishutang was quiet, with sparse transactions. Total transactions included over a hundred bags of peanuts, over seven hundred bags of wheat, and five carts of eight hundred bags of soybeans. Among these, there were also goods bought by dealers. Oil included six hundred pieces of Jiacang raw oil and fifty pieces of Lunlianqi soybean oil. Currently, there are no changes expected in the market conditions for various commodities.</p>
<h3 id="e212">White Tung Oil Exports Not Strong Last Month <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The white tung oil market is primarily centered in Hubei, and the export volume last month seemed lower than the previous month. The approximate total was just over a thousand tons. Market price fluctuations were limited. The highest price for January was only 25 yuan, and the lowest was 22.7 yuan, a difference of only 2.3 yuan. The average was around 23.6 yuan. Because foreign firms did not handle large quantities, fluctuations were small. At the end of the month, American foreign firms made some purchases, and the selling price was 23.2 yuan. Then, Hubei firms wanted to increase the price, apparently requiring 23.6 or 7 yuan before they would sell. The foreign firms were unwilling to do so, so the deal did not close. By the beginning of this month, the price was still only 23.2 yuan, and there were some transactions. Therefore, the rumors in Shanghai that Hubei was reporting good conditions were only empty talk and there were no real transactions taking place. The current market is like this, and because the settlement period is approaching, there is likely to be no change in market conditions. It is heard that Hubei dealers bought Hubei tung oil for slightly more than 19 yuan, and Wenchou, including taxes, was only 18.6 or 7 yuan. The after-market may increase slightly, but it is not known. This is probably due to the small number of sellers. Local firms are in the process of closing, and there have been very few transactions recently. Zhejiang tung oil is gradually becoming cheaper. A few days ago, the Hangzhou market traded at 19.1 or 2 yuan for Jiangsu delivery.</p>

<p>With the end of the lunar year approaching, metal merchants are rushing to close their accounts. As a result, there is very little buying and selling in the market. Market prices have not changed significantly. However, some factories are still absorbing futures contracts for the next regular period. It is heard that tinplate, cement, rebar, and factory-made nails are all being bought, but the quantities are not as large as usual.</p>

Telegrams from Lyon and other places are gradually being forwarded to Shanghai. European firms are taking the opportunity to purchase yellow and white factory silk, and transactions are not limited.

<p>As the end of the year approaches, the trade in woolen fabrics is becoming increasingly sluggish. Inventories are being checked and accounts are being settled in order to close the books and prepare for a new year. Recently, the market for various thick and thin woolen fabrics has been virtually stagnant. Even the business of clothing shops that sell piece goods is now much worse, showing signs of closing down. Ordinary winter woolens have already been purchased by customers. However, ready-made coats for men and women still have considerable business recently.

<h3 id="e235">A Serious Problem <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>This is by no means an ordinary piece of news, but a serious problem concerning the future of Shanghai! Yesterday, I opened a certain evening newspaper and saw a shocking headline in a special font, which stated: "The city market is declining and business is sluggish. Recently, more than 500 large and small shops have been sued for debt and have applied to the court for enforcement of closure; many are on Nanjing Road. The current authorities are considering this, because a rash execution would have a huge impact on the entire Shanghai market..." The day before yesterday, I visited Wang Qun, a business tycoon in this city, on business, and we talked about the current commercial situation in Shanghai. He said: "Since the January 28th Incident, the city market has become increasingly depressed. The increase in rents has made it difficult for ordinary merchants to bear. In addition, the rural economy is bankrupt, and various countries are also experiencing depression, financial difficulties, and reduced purchasing power. In these turbulent times, maintaining the status quo is already a very difficult task, let alone development! Although, from the surface, Shanghai seems to be thriving recently, with magnificent ten-story buildings, grand cinemas, large hotels, dance halls, and banks springing up like mushrooms after a rain. But if you observe from the side, I believe that these are all abnormal developments and should not be considered good phenomena. They symbolize the crisis of Shanghai's future. According to my accurate estimation, the number of businesses in this city that will close down by the end of the lunar year will not be small..." I think, if the above two pieces of news are true, then isn't Shanghai really going to collapse? But, in my opinion, these are not unfounded words, and it is indeed a serious problem! However, the obstacles that create this problem are nothing more than the following six reasons.</p>
<p>(The gift of the January 28th Incident) Since the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese army committed atrocities in Zhabei, more than half of Shanghai's market was destroyed by artillery fire. Although the concessions barely maintained a normal state (?), the market has since been in a slump, and financial turnover has been sluggish. Those big capitalists are also in a state of desperation, and most of the small capitalists are unable to maintain themselves and have fallen into decline one after another. Only a few are able to barely survive. (The global economic depression) The wave of the global economic depression has hit China, and the business community has been the first to bear the brunt, directly and indirectly suffering its great impact. Because our country has been plagued by foreign aggression and internal strife for several years, and has also suffered from natural and man-made disasters, the squeeze of great power aggression, and the exploitation of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. It was already full of holes and had lost its vitality, how could it withstand the pressure of this depression!</p>
<p>(The bankruptcy of the rural economy) Our country has always been recognized by countries around the world as an agricultural country, so the countryside has become the lifeline of our country, especially the source of life for the business community. Once the countryside goes bankrupt, the national commercial market will also collapse. This is undoubtedly true. In recent years, our country's rural areas have been plagued by floods, droughts, wars, and banditry, one after another, and agricultural products have also suffered from a sharp decline. The silk and tea, which farmers regard as a major source of income, have also plummeted. There are no rich households in the villages, and there are starving people on the roads. The distant causes and near consequences are not a matter of a day or two. How great is its relationship with commerce!</p>
<p>(The decline in purchasing power) Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside, the economic turnover is sluggish. Purchasing power is also decreasing day by day, which has dealt a huge blow to the business operations of various business communities. Merchants originally rely entirely on people's purchases to maintain their lives, but now the decline in purchasing power is tantamount to monopolizing the source of their lives.</p>
<p>(Senseless competition) Because of the sluggish business, they compete with each other by lowering prices, hoping to attract customers and increase their purchasing power. Therefore, in the streets and alleys, in front of stores large and small, the banners of big discounts and big giveaways are often hung up all year round. The decorative consumption of one kind is bound to be an alarming number when calculated. But this method is only like a dying person taking a shot of adrenaline, just to prolong this moment of life. Fundamentally, isn't it still the same hopeless?</p>
<p>(The unbearable burden of rent) At present, the price of real estate in Shanghai is only being raised as much as possible, and those big landlords, in order to protect their own interests, have no choice but to produce on the tenants! So they desperately increase the rent, regardless of the strength of the tenants, whether they can afford these or not, they just squeeze them heavily. The income of ordinary merchants in one month of business is not enough to pay for one month of rent. Therefore, they inevitably go into debt and go bankrupt. Those who made money in previous years can still struggle a little. If it is a newly opened business or one without a foundation, it is impossible to gain a foothold!</p>
<p>From the above six reasons, I infer that the more than five hundred stores being sued are indeed in a situation of helplessness, and they really have unspeakable pain. If the authorities rashly execute them according to the requirements of the plaintiffs, the impact on the entire city of Shanghai will be unimaginable. If the authorities, in order to take care of the city's market, do not execute them, then in the future, once this trend starts, it will also cause great resentment! I don't know how the authorities will deal with this difficult case in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>The voices of the rent reduction movement in the past few days have spread throughout the city. This is good news to hear; I wonder what the outcome will be in the future? Let us wait quietly for the arrival of this good news!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Beside the Garbage Dump <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>One pile, two piles... Mountains of gray garbage piled up, filling this desolate square, scattered and disorderly. From a distance, it looked just like a cemetery in an ossuary where graves were mass-buried.</p>
<p>The clear morning sun gradually shone into the square. Wisps of heat rose from the garbage piles, emitting a strange, sour, and moldy odor.</p>
<p>(Wooo)! After a while, a yellow garbage truck occasionally came speeding, and clouds of dust and mist filled the sky, like dark clouds. The children all raised an arm to cover their eyes.</p>
<p>There are especially many children here, and they are all dressed in such tattered and dirty clothes. Although it is the cold winter, some are still barefoot. They are innocent and lively, jumping around. From their oily black faces and ragged clothes, it is clear that they are the children of the poor. They all have parents and families, but because of poverty, they are not qualified to enjoy "modern education" like the little "darlings" and "brothers". Every day, from early morning until dusk, they are just immersed in this only "park"—the desolate square—burying their golden childhood in the garbage dump.</p>
<p>The strange odor emitted from the huge garbage piles attracts them. This is the only old theater stage, the natural battlefield, and the fascinating gambling factory. Here, there are often the footprints of great men such as "Emperor", "King", "Wu Song", and "Zhang Fei". Large-scale, organized fierce battles often erupt. They play marbles and cards, and even forget to go home for dinner because of small gambles for a few pennies. Here, there is also cunning, treachery, deception, and power. This is a miniature world, a free gathering place for poor children.</p>
<p>Three or four children are surrounding a pile of new garbage in the left corner. Each is holding a bamboo stick or a short rod, dragging and scratching. Carefully and attentively, they are looking for discarded waste that is still slightly valuable—scrap iron, rags, empty cans, etc.—to supplement the meager income of their poor families.</p>
<p>(Oh)! Little Gouzi, who was ten years old, suddenly jumped up while dragging and scratching in a trance. (What?)? Little Qizi and Zhaodi next to him were both stunned by this unusual shout. They asked in unison. (Money) Little Gouzi said, revealing the pattern of a banknote from the gap between the fingers of a tightly clenched hand. (Let me see)! Little Qizi stretched out his left hand a long way. (No way! I picked it up) Little Gouzi shook his head and took two steps back. (You won't even let me see it)? Little Qizi said, glancing at Zhaodi next to him, taking two steps forward, his chest puffed up, his right hand tightly grasping the broken stool leg used to drag the garbage, just like an officer of an imperial power holding a command knife. The situation was about to turn violent.</p>
<p>(It doesn't matter if you take a look! Anyway, no one wants your money). Zhaodi was, after all, a girl, and her tone was more slick.</p>
<p>Little Gouzi hesitated! He thought that if it was just Zhaodi, he wouldn't be afraid. To deal with a girl, he only needed to grab her yellow and short braid, and all problems would be solved. But Little Qizi was a tough one. Not to mention that he was a head taller than him, that thick and hard stool leg would be at least a little uncomfortable if it hit his waist. Moreover, Little Qizi had just winked at Zhaodi, definitely negotiating some secret diplomacy, preparing to rob him of his banknote and split it in half. Under this serious situation, rather than resisting at the cost of losing the banknote and suffering physical pain, it would be better to respectfully offer it with both hands. If Little Qizi and Zhaodi occasionally discovered a little "humanity" or "conscience", there might still be a few percent hope of consolation.</p>
<p>(It's okay to look, but no one is allowed to rob). Little Gouzi was, after all, smart. In the end, he decided to adopt a policy of non-resistance, but his tone absolutely concealed his weakness.</p>
<p>Little Gouzi loosened his hand holding the banknote, and six eyes stared at the banknote like hungry wolves.</p>
<p>(A fake banknote, for the devils)! Little Qizi and Zhaodi discovered that it was a five-dollar</p>
<p>fake banknote. Not only was the pattern very blurred, but a corner of the banknote was also burned black. (Ha! Hurry up and take it back for your mom to use) Zhaodi sarcastically mocked.</p>
<p>Everything was destroyed! Little Qizi's contemptuous smile and Zhaodi's mocking sarcasm made Little Gouzi feel extremely humiliated. This humiliation was more vicious than cursing his mother or his ancestors for thirteen generations. It was a permanent and indelible disgrace.</p>
<p>Little Gouzi's tears flowed unconsciously to his cheeks. He didn't know whether he was sad or indignant! He fiercely tore the banknote in half and threw it on the ground, lowered his head, and quietly left the square with a weeping face. Finally, he only heard him say softly, (No one said it was real)!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Human Cleverness <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>(Humans are the most intelligent of all beings). Yes, humans are indeed the most intelligent animals in the universe. However, even among these (intelligent animals), there is a natural division between the wise and the foolish. At least, I think I am one of the most foolish among this group of (intelligent animals).</p>
<p>Once, I had to go from the western district to the eastern district for some business, so I took a tram. The tram was extremely crowded. Not only were all the seats taken, but even those standing in the middle of the aisle were jostling back and forth, everyone with red faces, struggling desperately. I stood beside the tram door, one hand pinching a coin, the other resting on the door to support myself. As the tram approached a certain stop, a fashionable young man struggled out of the crowd, his face so solemn, as if he was very resentful of my hand resting on the door. He forcefully flung my hand away, sliding the door open with a bang. My hand landed in the door seam, holding it open. After he got out, he immediately slammed the door shut. This time, my fingers were caught. I was in so much pain that I wanted to cry, instinctively pulling my hand back and examining the flowing blood. At this moment, the young man was still standing on the platform, glaring at me ferociously through the glass, muttering:</p>
<p>(Damn it! Doesn't know what's good for him!)</p>
<p>I wrapped my injured finger with a handkerchief, enduring double the pain. After a while, the conductor finally took the coins I had already counted, threw them into the coin bag, and said: (Sorry, wait a moment), then went to the back.</p>
<p>When the tram arrived at another stop, another young man stood up from a seat next to a burly man. In his haste, he stepped on the burly man's outstretched foot. The burly man's eyes widened, and he said loudly: (Are you blind? Damn it!)</p>
<p>The young man kept saying (I'm sorry) while bending down to dust off the man's foot. The burly man then grunted (forget it), and the young man got off the tram in a fluster.</p>
<p>The tram was about to reach my destination, but the ticket had not yet arrived. I was worried about (the conductor), worried that (the ticket inspector) would be coming soon. I wanted to ask him for the ticket several times, but I finally hesitated and didn't say anything. Later, I couldn't bear the worry any longer, so I took the opportunity to tug at (the conductor) and gently asked:</p>
<p>(Can I have the ticket now? Hey.) (It's alright, I know!) (The conductor) smiled and looked out the window, then walked to the back again.</p>
<p>(The ticket inspector) finally came. I was really worried about (the conductor) because I felt it was his responsibility.</p>
<p>The ticket inspector asked me for my ticket, so I pointed anxiously at the conductor. (The ticket inspector) shouted: (Number XXX, where's the ticket!) (What? Did he ever buy a ticket?) (The conductor), with his hat pushed back and his mouth full of saliva, said fiercely.</p>
<p>(Well, I did buy it.) I don't know why, but my face felt a little hot, and I couldn't speak loudly.</p>
<p>(How much? Buy it now! I saw you just get on!) (The conductor) said aggressively. (A few coins don't matter, but I really did buy it. I might as well buy another one now.) I took out the coins and gave them to the ticket inspector, asking him to give me change. I thought (the conductor) should understand.</p>
<p>(Hmph! Who wants your handout?) The conductor continued to grumble. At this moment, I got off the tram in silence, still hearing (the ticket inspector) and the driver scolding:</p>
<p>(What a grievance! If you can't afford the tram, don't take it!)</p>
<p>I stood on the street, stroking my aching finger, and I was lost. Afterwards, I thought of vowing never to take the tram again. But my friend T said to me: (Bin, you're too stupid! Do you still want to live in this world? Open your eyes and look at the whole world. Isn't everything like this? To avoid it, you only have to not live!)</p>
<p>Then I realized, now I know "This is the cleverness humans should have." I also want to learn to be smarter in the future, because I still want to live.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Sending a Couplet to Celebrate the Old Year <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Shi</p>
<p>I remember (Modern) once published a couplet written by Mr. Yu Dafu himself, which read: (Avoiding my seat, I fear hearing of literary inquisitions. Writing books is all for rice and sustenance.) It roughly quoted a line from Gong Ding'an's poetry. Mr. Yu Dafu is a famous writer.</p>
<p>Judging by his background, he can also be considered to come from a distinguished family. Naturally, his own position here is not inferior to the masses, and moreover, Mr. Dafu has been a true literati from beginning to end, without any ambition to (usurp power) or rebellious intentions to (rise up in revolt). Logically, he should have been able to enjoy his quiet life. However, he had such feelings. As for the general public who stand below Mr. Dafu, the extent of their feelings is needless to say. From this, we can gauge the climate of our country.</p>
<p>Now it is time for the Lunar New Year again. Although the government has long issued an order to abolish it, even in Shanghai, this center of civilization, the general public still paste red couplets on their doors and set off firecrackers during this period to express welcoming the new and sending off the old. Firecrackers are uniform, the most uniform thing being the sound of firecrackers. Red couplets, however, vary in style, especially the ones pasted on the doors of so-called scholarly families, which undergo the greatest changes. Moreover, many of them change with the changes in national affairs and political situations at that time. But I wonder if there are still such scholarly families? If there are, then please paste this couplet recorded by Mr. Dafu.</p>
<p>Literati are generally only able to grumble, so as the saying goes: (A scholar's rebellion will not succeed in three years.) However, literati who can grumble are ultimately more promising. In the past, many literati, because they suffered from not having a place to use their talents, inevitably vented some of their grievances in couplets. However, now even this is not easy to see.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I only felt that red paper with black characters pasted on the door was much better looking than the original black door frame, and I was also very happy because it told me that I would be wearing new clothes and eating good food. After entering school, I learned that there were many meanings to them. However, in general, there was no significant change. It wasn't! (Heaven increases years, man increases lifespan, spring fills the universe, fortune fills the door), or! (Spring flowers, spring wine, spring wealth, fortune, prosperity, longevity, auspiciousness), almost every year it was these words.</p>
<p>This year, as the second anniversary of the January 28th Incident passes, with many bloodstains still blurred in our hearts, the Lunar New Year arrives. I might as well send everyone a couplet to congratulate them on this (prosperous year) that should be filled with joy: (National affairs are unbearable to discuss, so let's not discuss national affairs. Family matters are mostly sighing, so let's just sigh about family matters.)</p>
<h3 id="e239">An Introduction to the Philosophy of Borrowing Money <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Fu</p>
<p>Usually, when you go to someone to borrow money, you always say half of what you want to say, leaving the other half for the other person to figure out. Saying half and leaving half for people to think about naturally requires the use of so-called presentation techniques. Because even a single bone fragment can reveal the whole body of a beast, but that requires specialized knowledge. However, few people prepare such specialized knowledge for the convenience of others borrowing money, so this is where misunderstandings arise in the world.</p>
<p>Originally, not using techniques is certainly not good, but if techniques are used excessively, people can become confused. Because saying half doesn't lead to loss of status, making people look down on you. However, for the sake of taking out your own money and cutting out your own flesh, even if you pretend to be foolish or ignorant to get by, that's probably what you hope for. Because everyone has their own reasons, and these reasons occur frequently, so those who borrow money, regardless of whether they leave too much for people to think about, or just the right amount, if there is no result, they will always think that people are deliberately confusing them.</p>
<p>And the other party, regardless of whether they hear the unsaid implications, or they really don't understand what's going on, they generally dismiss it lightly, rejoicing that they have avoided being robbed. This will always easily lead to resentment, and once resentment arises, they will always want to retaliate against the other party. So, among the so-called kidnappers, I'm afraid there are quite a few such gentlemen who borrow money.</p>

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>(4) Wedding March. Spring, the days pass by like flying. But as Kejia and Jingyi hate the long nights, the spring breeze still quickly sends away three days. On this third morning, readers should come to attend this wedding. In front of a large hotel next to the racecourse, five-colored ribbons flutter in the March spring breeze. Waiters in white uniforms shuttle back and forth like shuttles. We walk forward from the aisle and can see Xiaosun wearing a nervous smile, shaking hands and nodding to every guest. Among the female guests, Jingwen is naturally indispensable.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony is the newest style. In the center of the living room is a long table covered with white cloth and a marriage certificate. When the bride and groom arrive by car, the ceremony will be held here to perform the (play) that adorns life.</p>
<p>A pair of mismatched guests walked in from the outside. Although the man was dressed up so nicely, his age made people feel that there was an irreconcilable regret in this couple. I will now introduce to the readers that the woman is Qinbo, and the man is, needless to say, her husband. When she came in, she seemed to pay special attention to Xiaosun. He jumped over, patted her shoulder and said, (Xiaosun, it's rare that you came back from Hangzhou.) Xiaosun was facing inside, talking to a friend. Startled, he turned around, saw that it was Qinbo, and seemed stunned as if he hadn't expected her to come. But he busied himself naturally and shook her hand. (Long time no see, Qinbo, it's rare that you came so early.) Nervously smiling. (Haven't met, have you?) She saw her husband standing beside her. (Mr. Zhu Xiaosun! Li Shaoqin) They shook hands, and nods represented greetings. Jingwen heard Qinbo's voice and ran over to greet her. (I thank you on behalf of my sister.) (Naughty child, I asked Jingyi a few days ago and she said you hadn't come to Shanghai yet.) (I couldn't get a substitute teacher, I really don't want to do this kind of thing.) Xiaosun stood beside her, shaking his naturally curly hair. Jingwen seemed to suddenly remember something and said: (My mother wants to meet you!) She let go of Qinbo's hand. (I won't entertain you.) Xiaosun and Li Shaoqin nodded, and the two of them went hand in hand to the temporary bridal chamber. Jingwen's mother was a kind middle-aged woman. Seeing the two of them smiling and entering, she stood up and asked: (Is this Mr. Zhu?) (Yes, younger brother...my mother.) (Auntie.) (Mr. Zhu, please don't laugh, I'm still like a child at such an old age.) One smiled innocently, and the other shook his naturally curly hair. (Thank you very much, Mr. Zhu, for coming all the way from Hangzhou to help.)</p>
<p>(It's right to come and congratulate you. Auntie.) (I heard that Mr. Zhu is recuperating in Hangzhou, is your health better now?) (Thank you, Auntie, it's better now.)</p>
<p>(Then after Kejia's wedding, you won't go back to Hangzhou?) Jingwen's mother lengthened her tone as if she had some hope, while looking at her daughter. (That's not certain...probably not going.) (Kejia said that there are too many empty rooms in his new house and he doesn't want to post rental notices. I've already agreed to move in with Jingwen. If Mr. Zhu can live in Shanghai, then we'll have even more fun.)</p>
<p>(That's naturally very good, almost all our own people! Um, better to be with close friends.) (It'll be even more fun when Mr. Zhu gets married.) The old lady said jokingly. Xiaosun nervously lowered his head and shook his naturally curly hair. The sound of military music rang out outside. The old lady said to Jingwen: (They're here!)</p>

<h3 id="e242">Katherine Hepburn's Novelty and Uniqueness <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>=Good at lies, even she says it's unreliable= =Eccentric behavior, a belly full of bad ideas= This Katherine Hepburn, who is called an American guest, is unfortunately called a substitute for Garbo because her face is somewhat like that of the Swedish star. In fact, she has her own special personality and her own artistic strengths, and she did not become famous by looking like a foreign star. Now, most actresses are following the trend of fashion, without the courage to develop their personal characteristics. Therefore, I have specially brought up the various unique points of this Katherine Hepburn, which may be of considerable benefit to the general actresses in China. Of course, Katherine also has various quirks that are not worth learning from, but isn't that an unavoidable metamorphosis in the midst of an actress's transformation? This Katherine Hepburn can also be called a strange star. She has been in Hollywood for so long, and her past life and family background have not yet been exposed. What she tells people today, she denies tomorrow. The most interesting thing is that she herself said that she has given birth to two children; her husband is called Ludlow Smith. But now she seems to deny it again. One day, she said to a reporter, (Okay, you can announce this news. Yes, I have children, I have two. It's really interesting. Of course, they all have pitch-black faces...you should also announce this for me.) You think this kind of talk is humorous enough, but if you meet a straightforward person who believes it, wouldn't it cause a big joke? Before Katherine came to Hollywood, she had already carefully examined everything in Hollywood. She knew that what Hollywood needed most at that time was strangeness and novelty. So she brought a big bag of strangeness and novelty to Hollywood. When she first arrived, the outside world had already released enough rumors, saying that she was a rich young lady, and that she had millions of her own property, etc. In this way, her reputation spread throughout the United States. She also has various eccentric behaviors in Hollywood, such as liking to wear worker's overalls, and she specially asked famous tailors to add a few patches to them. She often reads letters sent to her by fans in the middle of the road. She also likes to talk to a monkey she keeps. She often wears only a very small pair of shorts besides her top. She is so strangely shaped, but she doesn't think it's strange at all.</p>
<p>People say she is very innocent, but she is too innocent. She often has a nose full of freckles, but after a few days, the freckles are no longer visible. It turns out that her freckles are not very obvious, but sometimes she deliberately deepens them with an eyebrow pencil, which makes the freckles more obvious. Isn't this too much innocence? One day, she suddenly had a strange idea and wanted to play golf. No one had ever seen her golf skills, but she played very well as soon as she hit the ball. She even dared to challenge Eileen Dunn, a female golf expert. This is also very strange. In short, she is like a magician who performs magic tricks, but no one can guess whether she has rabbits or chickens hidden in her hat. Even she herself admits that she is an unreliable liar. But she can play any role like anyone else, she does everything well, and she can do everything well. Aren't these all the skills that an all-around actress must have?</p>

<p>— Lv Yi</p>
<p>(Life) is a work with a novel style, containing profound stimulation and educational significance. Ruan Lingyu and Lin Chuchu are models of two types of women, and at the same time, they can be said to be models of two mothers. Ruan Lingyu's life (in the furnace of life, a fragile soul is tempered, tempered, and tempered) has suffered setbacks and tribulations. She sincerely understands the unwillingness of an inhuman life, but she cannot find a bright path in the dark journey of life, and finally ends her life in a muddle. In the current society, there are many women who have groped in the dark for a lifetime like this, and (Life) reminds them. Lin Chuchu, on the other hand, is a human mother who regards educating children as a lifelong task. She abandons all desires and devotes her life's energy to educating children. But this kind of ideal woman is probably forever in the realm of ideals!</p>
<p>The author also raised the issue of social education and family education. He explained that for a person's thoughts, behaviors, and character, social education and family education are more important than school education. The advantages and disadvantages of the social and family environment have an infinitely great influence on people. Everyone knows this, but everyone has been confused about it. This is worthy of serious attention by educators in general.</p>
<p>Speaking again of the issue of a young man's way out. It is extremely proper for a young man to be dissatisfied with his own life and seek a long-term way out. But what should be carefully noted is to be careful not to step into dangerous territory, or even find a dead end. The young man in (Life) is an example. He sought a way out because he was not used to the hard life of an elementary school teacher, but as a result, he ended up committing suicide. This is an excellent lesson for young people. In short, after watching (Life), it is as if you have heard a philosophical lesson. Recalling it, there is infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>A (woman) went from being a (wild child), (maid), (female worker) to becoming a (prostitute), and she still thought she had tasted all the flavors of (life). An elementary school teacher, he felt that his (life) was too ordinary, so he left his wife to find a new path in the big city. Unexpectedly, he and she were combined, and a year later, they had a child. She thought that she had lived a hard life for half her life and should enjoy it, so she gradually could not maintain it, which led him astray. He thought of the life of the child, so he wrote a letter to his ex-wife, asking her to take care of the child, and he threw himself into the sea to end their (life). She, who had drifted all her life, finally realized and took a child without a mother as her son. She thought of her own son, so she went to hug him and live with this child. Because of different education, the children quarreled. So her own son was taken away by her husband's ex-wife again. Fifteen years have passed, she is old and was driven out by a man with a son. Where is her home? She did not have the courage to see her own son, and finally, one day, she fell to the ground and died, ending her (life). What does (life) taste like? The taste of (life) is originally a packet of bitter water.</p>

<p>— Ke Luo</p>
<p>This film takes promoting national goods and resisting foreign goods as the center of its ideology, which seems to be very correct; however, it actually distorts the facts and obscures the truth, making people think of (malicious propaganda) immediately after watching it.</p>
<p>The story describes how great the authority of the goods (note: it does not specify (enemy) goods or (Japanese) goods here) inspection association is, and how enthusiastic the public security bureau is in cracking down on counterfeit goods. If this is really the case, then what else can we say? It's just that what we actually see is the foreign goods inspection association being dissolved and disbanded, the inspectors being arrested and imprisoned, and the unimpeded sales of enemy goods in our country. These are ironclad facts!</p>
<p>Therefore, we see it how it is far away from reality and dreaming vaguely. That mediocre and despicable preaching makes people want to vomit!</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects, they are still not satisfactory. Although the director used many small clever tricks—such as using the child to discover the hole in his father's shoe to show his poverty, and using long cigarette ash to show</p>
<p>Li Accountant's anxiety: these are all very good—however, in the end, they are just small clever tricks. There are many scenes in the photography that are unacceptable, such as when Kejian went to investigate counterfeit goods at night, the light was no different from daytime! The actors all seemed a bit stiff. Zhang Zhenduo, who played Diao Renzhi, was very flexible and competent, but in many places he was very pretentious. Kejian's sick mother had no signs of illness, and was obviously pretending to be sick there. Ye Qiuxin is just an ordinary character in this film and has not been fully expressed.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Cang Yinqiu Misses Her Relatives on the Holiday <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Background Board</p>
<p>(Alone as a stranger in a foreign land, I miss my relatives all the more on every holiday. I know my brothers are climbing to the high places, wearing dogwood, missing one person.) This is a poem about missing relatives on holidays in Tang poetry. The lines write out the heart of a traveler, which can be said to be extremely thorough. Unexpectedly, the old man's poem has become a portrayal of modern people. There is an actress in the film industry, Cang Yinqiu. A few years ago, she came to Shanghai from Henan alone. Although she relied on her intelligence and hard work, she has now occupied a place in the film industry, but she is alone and wandering in a foreign land. The white clouds and the setting moon often make her think of her hometown. Sometimes, she even forgets to eat and sleep, which is really a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met Miss Cang Yinqiu at Yihua Company. From her mouth, I learned that she has a role in (Woman), and it is a role that suits her personality. When we were talking, suddenly a burst of explosive sound came from outside. Cang Yinqiu heard it and asked: (Is this the sound of firecrackers?)</p>
<p>A person next to her immediately replied: (Not bad, it's just those stubborn villagers who are celebrating the harvest.) Who knew that this sentence was not serious, but it touched the heart of this thoughtful girl Cang Yinqiu. She immediately showed a solemn expression on her face, motionless, and seemed to be thinking about something. Everyone looked at her and felt very strange, so they asked each other why she was suddenly standing there in a daze? Cang Yinqiu then said indifferently: (I'm alone in Shanghai. Every time I spend the New Year, I always shed tears several times! It turns out that you don't know that my parents are still waiting for me in my hometown...), she said here, and her eyes seemed to be a little wet! The many people who heard this all lowered their heads, and the air immediately became quiet. Naturally, everyone expressed their deep sympathy for Cang Yinqiu.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e247">Christina the Queen (5) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Watson</p>
<p>The young imperial envoy asked Christina again: "How much further is it to the nearest inn?" Christina laughed and said, "It's still more than six miles. By the time you get there, it will be night. Of course, you wouldn't want to get stuck in a ditch again." The young man bowed deeply and said, "Thank you for your kindness." He assumed Christina was a boy because she was wearing men's clothing, so he instructed his servant, "Peter, give this child a gold pound." After saying that, he went back into the carriage. Christina took a gold pound from the servant's hand. She smiled and turned the gold pound over and over in her hand, looking at it. On the gold pound was engraved her own face, and around it were the words "Her Majesty Queen Christina of Sweden." She put the gold pound in her pocket and then watched the caravan leave. Olaf led the horse over and helped her mount. They walked slowly. After Christina had gone a distance, she reined in the horse. She sat on the horse and thought for a while, then looked at the road the caravan had taken. Suddenly, she turned the horse around and chased after the caravan.</p>
<p>Soon they had caught up with the caravan. She deliberately took off her hat and bowed deeply on horseback to the young man in the carriage. The man in the carriage returned the greeting in the same way. Christina laughed inwardly and hurried ahead. Olaf followed closely behind. As dusk approached, they arrived at an inn. She reined in the horse at the entrance, handed the horse to the inn's porter, and she and Olaf went into the inn. She entered the inn and looked around. There were several low wooden houses, lit by a few candles. In the fireplace, firewood was burning, emitting a blazing light. Many farming families were sitting around eating, and there were also a few soldiers pretending to be on duty. The porters were busy going back and forth with large trays. A large piece of meat was also roasting on the fire, which made Olaf's mouth water. Christina asked in a clear voice, "Where is the innkeeper?" A fat man ran up to her and asked, "What does the guest need?" Christina said, "Dinner, a room, a bed." The innkeeper sized her up and down and then said, "There is only one room left. It is the best room, specially for distinguished guests. The room fee is ten taels." Christina turned to Olaf and said, "Give him twenty taels!" The innkeeper, as if he had received a god of wealth, bowed deeply. While taking the money, he hurriedly led the way, repeatedly calling "Sir," and led them to a large room upstairs. Inside there was a large four-poster bed, a table, a mirror, and several chairs. In a large fireplace in the wall, wood had already been loaded, and it only needed a spark to ignite. Christina took off her hat and brushed off the snow. She felt very happy about this kind of naughty thing, like a mischievous child. Olaf was arranging the bedding in the room, and Christina went out to the corridor outside the room, looking down, eagerly hoping for the arrival of the Spanish caravan. (To be continued)</p>
