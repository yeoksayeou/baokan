<p>（南京）　中美兩國政府關於白銀問題之另一換文、現由雙方約定同時公布、摘録如下、</p>
<p>一九三四年八月十九日羅斯福總統由克寗瀚總領事致孔部長文云、貴國代表所簽訂之一九三三年七月之倫敦銀恊定、近已爲貴國政府所批准、其宗旨在於穏定銀價、蓋以當時印度及西班牙政府保持大宗存銀有危及銀價之慮也、一九三四年之購銀法令、亦有同樣影響銀價及貴國利益之慮、貴國爲欲保障其金融起見、因願敝國政府闡明其將來之購銀政策云云、</p>
<p>一九三四年十月一日、美總領事克寗瀚上孔部長書云、接准九月二十二日國務院來電稱、美國政府甚願向中國政府申說其白銀政策、美國購銀政策以下述數點爲根據、一九三四年購銀法規定通貨準備之金銀比數以銀佔四分之一爲最後目的、財部應於某種時期某種條件及某種情形下認爲最有利於公衆利益者購銀以達此目的、美政府認此舉爲實施一九三三年七月二十日幣制金融委員會第二股之决議、美政府瞭解實行購銀法時應大加留意、並明悉銀價過高將於本國及外國金融發生不幸影響、美政府應願避免足以妨碍他國政府保護存銀之行動、如中國政府任何時期認爲必須取締白銀出口、則本政府願意接受中國政府之意見、俾求政府得照中國政府之政策進行其購銀法云云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晨各報甚注意中政府取締白銀出口之計劃、金融新聞稱、中國現脫離銀本位、中國方面今未能有白銀輸出點、故中國未有白銀之輸出可爲跨賣之結果、因是之故、將來中國匯兌之波動、可不繫於銀價之變動、無論上海銀元如何低跌、絕不致因低跌而有白銀運出云、金融時報稱、就昨日市塲趨勢觀之、中國之一再努力、欲遏止因羅總統白銀政策而起之不利反動者、仍未有多大影響云、倫敦泰晤士報社論稱、白銀出口稅之增加、或將阻止中國存銀之流出但在美政府進行其現有政策及投機家繼續操縱市塲時、中國欲使其幣價不因緊縮而漲起、恐非易事云、泰晤士報華盛頓訪員稱、據華盛頓財部人員之意見、中國之增收白銀出口稅、乃趨向禁令之第一步驟、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　財政部長摩根曹頃宣稱、中國政府加徵白銀出口稅、僅足使美國以較昻之價購買白銀、其意若云無可以阻止之也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　中國曾建議與美國交換金銀、美聯社因此向華盛頓消息靈通之觀察者探詢意見、彼等以爲中國政府儘可購得大批現金、絕無阻礙、中國儘可由倫敦之金銀市塲交換金銀、美國雖禁金出口、惟對於金本位國家並不禁止輸出、故中國如根據致美照會所云採用金本位制、則運金赴華亦屬許可、惟中國所有現銀、大半爲私人所有、而非政府所有、恐將發生困難耳、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>美國墨斯可其　參議員湯姆斯今日與此間美聯社訪員談話、謂中國政府徵收出口稅以阻止現銀流出之舉、手段殊爲精明、彼以爲中國此種自衛方法、實較美國精明遠甚、蓋美國購銀使中國幣價高漲、以致物價低落、亦猶十年前世界購金、美國受損、然美國須經過十年始知設法救濟耳、湯氏爲參院膨脹派領袖、彼以爲中國增加銀稅之效果如何、一時尙無從確定云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c9">白銀出口徵稅 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 有</p>
<p>我財部已於日昨宣布自本月十五日起實行徵收白銀出口稅。這稅則的内容。可分兩層。第一。是白銀出口基本稅。卽生銀出口連鑄費在内。須共徵百分之十的稅率。第二。是白銀出口平衡稅。卽倫敦銀價折合上海匯兌之比價。對於上海公定匯價之差。如超過前項出口稅率時。得照其所超過之數隨時加徵。在此國内經濟困難的時期中。擾攘多時的白銀問題。有了這一個辦法。確可以得到暫時告一段落的解决。因爲這個方法。對於一般利用差價獲得不當利益的投機商人。必能予以有力的重大打擊。當局有此决心。有此快刀斬亂麻的手段。自是值得國人稱許。</p>
<p>惟是從國家整個經濟政策上着想。尙須要用進一步的方法。蓋白銀問題。不但含有國内的意義。另一方面還有國際意義。白銀是我們的通貨本位。同時又爲國際方面一種相當重要的商品。所以實際的說。白銀漲價意義。是兩方面的。第一。從上述這個基礎上說。美國白銀政策。顯然有他的基本目的。他是要以透過銀價高漲的方法。實現其降低貨幣價值的目的。因爲從美國目下情形看。抬高銀價。便無異於物價抬高。在物價抬高的關係之下。美國國富價值。也就可抬高起來。這是美國白銀政策的出發點。我們今日應該知道的。其次。銀價高漲的另一方面意義。是在使用銀國的貨幣價值。日趨昻貴。亦卽是使用銀國的物價繼續低下。因此國富的價值。也就相對的縮减起來。這是我們應該知道的第二點。從這兩點意義說。目前白銀出口徵稅政策。似乎僅能防止白銀大量的流出。而於此防止白銀大量流出外。尙須建立他種輔助方法。然後方可防止美國白銀政策對於中國物價所生的不良影響。蓋如何救濟物價影響。是不能僅憑「白銀保管」政策所能做得到的。</p>
<p>本來經濟政策的中心。是在於物價水準能維持在一定程度之下。不可有異常的漲落。像在目前美國銀價抬高的當兒。中國所應採取的政策。不但要防止銀價向上的打擊。還要維持物價水平的固定性。所以我們說白銀徵稅之外。還得進一步採取必要的手段。這是我們認爲值得注意的一個問題。</p>

<p>第三回　未解飄零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>但他不敢走廊子下，和程志前，離着遠遠的，好去避免正面的衝突。却由院子正中心，繞了彎子走過去。程志前看到，不由心裏一動，這姑娘好像在那裏見過，雖然不脫鄕下女子的樣子，却還乾乾凈凈的，是個規矩人家女兒。於是不由得把訪問白種人的意思抛開，專一注意到這姑娘身上去。那小脚婦人却已走到他身邊，扶了他的肩膀道：不要緊的，這個地方，我熟得很，差不多每天來兩三回。這裏的先生，一大半都是熟人呢。說着話，可就走到了張介夫門口。茶房早是搶進房去，手叉了門簾子，笑着點點頭道：你不信有鐡打的床，你進來看看。那姑娘伸頭看看，似乎知道裏面有人，就對那小脚婦人道：就在外面看看罷。那小脚婦人在他肩上輕輕的拍了一下道：你這孩子，眞没有出息。聽到說好看，就要來看。來了，又不進去。有我陪着你，怕什麽？他說了這話，帶拉着那位姑娘就進屋子去了。程志前恍然大悟，這就是李士廉，昨日所說的那位逃難的姑娘。這姑娘在咸陽渡船上曾碰到過的，所以想起來面貌很熟了。人家旣是逃難的女孩子，就不應當算計人家，不免走過去，取點監視的意味看他們怎樣。他想着，走過去時，便是李士廉也由屋子裏走來了。聽到張介夫在屋子裏問了一句話，這位姑娘也姓胡嗎？接着便道：李先生程先生請進來坐，我這裏來了一位參觀的。那姑娘在屋子裏，本來覺得受窘，見窗子外面又來了兩個人，就拉了小脚婦人走出來。李士廉倒笑着向他點點頭道：我也住在這裏，不坐一會兒去嗎？（四一）</p>
<h3 id="c189">紹興的詞調 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>到過紹興的，想都聽到過所謂「三品詞調」或在貫珠橋，塔子橋一帶，見到過「某某三品詞調」的招牌，接一連二地高掛着。唱詞調的人，都是盲子，并且是男女合唱的。他們所用的樂器，是三絃，二胡，洋琴，所以呌做「三品」。也有「五品」的，卽於「三品」之外，加上一隻二胡及一隻琵琶是。樂器之中，以三絃爲主。這猶如平劇中的鼓板，都由男盲子彈奏的。</p>
<p>人家有喜慶等事，常呌他們去彈彈唱唱，凑凑熱閙。一次代價，聞三元五元不等，看那喜慶之家的手面而定。那些盲子在應徵時候，身上居然換了一套綢衣服，鼻上架了一副黑眼鏡，摸索過市，望之可發一噱。然與其說可發一噱，還不如可憐，因爲他們生涯是很苦的。</p>
<p>詞調的原始不可考，或云脫胎於平調。調多靡靡之音。所唱的，當然是些公子小姐離合悲歡等一類故事。唱正文之先，照例要唱一雙短詞，呌做「接詩」。這猶如蘇州說小書的要先唱一雙開篇。據說學唱詞調，也非易易。「曾記梨花細雨天」，這句能唱得合拍，師就可大吃其「生炒脚魚」了。所以他們有「曾記梨花細雨天，生炒脚魚要吃大半年」的話。至於謝師何以要用「生炒脚魚」，則不可得而知了。詞調的脚本，是但憑口授的；如想調查它，是一樁難事；否則倒大可作爲一種研究民衆文學的大好材料哩。</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>提起揚州的寒生來，我不得不說一句「斯文掃地。」原來這所謂寒生也者，就是一種變相的乞丐。雖然上海有不少以文爲生的文丐，然而那些文丐是賣文爲生，並不是當眞去乞。惟有這揚州的寒生倒的確是道地的「文丐」。</p>
<p>這些寒生們，有的的確受過「十年寒窗」的風味，可惜命運不好，没有能够「一舉成名。」在從前，還可以謀個館餬餬口，然而在現在學校林立的時候誰肯來請敎你這之乎者也的酸先生，於是他們爲着生活的鞭策，不得不走上寒生的一條路。寒生們的求乞地點是茶館，和那有紅白喜事的人家。所以揚州人對於這般寒生老爺，都有點懼怕；因爲應酬得不好，他們的慾壑没有滿足的時候，往往會拍桌打凳的大閙全武行，弄得「茶壺與茶碗齊飛，板凳和桌子共舞，」不是使賓客不歡嗎？所以對於地們，總是百般的敷衍，而他們的氣燄，也就愈來愈高了！</p>
<p>寒生裏面，固然有不少的末路王孫，但是粗識之無，藉「寒生」兩個字來作乞討的護符的，的確是居多數。我們對於那眞正的讀書種子，自然應該援助他，使他們有個安身之地，餬口之方；然而那些西貝寒生，也是應該加以取締，以維持讀書人的尊嚴。</p>

<p>太后忽然又把伊的視綫，旋到了向東的一方面去，臉兒正對着奉天；一面還在若斷若續地自語着，不過因爲聲音太低，我也聽不分明伊所說的是什麽話。伊的眸子裏更透着一種異樣的情緒，彷彿是在很遠的距離之外，給伊發現了什麽人物或景象，因此便把伊的視綫吸引住了；然而我們却都不曾有這種幻覺，大家只隨着伊老人家，望西面胡亂瞧瞧而已。</p>
<p>最後，老佛爺自己也眺望得够了，便依舊回到了車上去，傳令開車。</p>
<p>火車當然還是開得很慢，像一條蚯蚓似的慢慢地離開了車站，打那長城的缺口裏，一步一搖的望前面滾去。當我們的機車滾進東三省的境界時，我們還在中國本部境内逗留着咧！接着，我們的黄色列車，便一輛一輛的離開了中土，進入我們的故鄕中去了。我雖然並没有怎樣深刻的地方觀念，但依據事實而論，東三省確是我們所不能否認的故鄕啊丨我們的祖先，就是在這一方土地上生長着的。</p>
<p>老佛爺的祖先，就是葉赫那拉的一族，一般也是這裏的土著。　　東三省而且還給中國造就了一個不可一世的人物，使中國全部的歷史，因他一人而大起變化。那不是别人，便是清太祖努爾哈赤！後來，清朝的歷代帝皇，從順治，康熙，雍正，乾隆，嘉慶，道光，咸豐（太后的丈夫）…到光緒，全都是努爾哈赤所傳下來的子孫。（一五一）</p>

<p>— 姚天羽</p>
<p>在故鄕蘇州，這時正是池塘裏的菱已成熟了。紅的胭紅，緑的碧緑，十分鮮艶，十分好看。</p>
<p>十二三歲的鄕下小姑娘，三五成羣，穿了藍地白花布的小衫，將衣袖捲得高高地，赤了雙脚，把浴盆當作了船兒，撑着竹篙，在船兒緩緩地進行之中，伸手池心，採着，採着。嘴裏還唱着他們的鄕歌，那歌兒是不一律的；但在旁人聽來，只覺得伊們的歌聲，在秋的長空里蕩漾着，異常自然，異常美妙。伊們在這樣快樂的心情之下，忘記了辛苦。</p>
<p>直到紅日西沉，伊們又把這豐盛的收穫，順便在傍河的人家呌賣着，那微妙的，帶着音樂的節奏的聲音，亦復令人神往，人們因給這種聲音所吸引，都要去買伊們一些來嘗嘗，於是那新鮮的，甘甜的滋味，便普遍了大家的舌齒間。</p>
<p>這樣的事一直要繼續到秋深露冷，草木黄落的時節才止。</p>
<p>在這裏的菱，也許是從故鄕運來的吧？但數量似不見得多呢！一般賣菱者破籃裏盛着的菱，皮壳不是焦黄，就是發黑了，裏面的肉子當然也要失去原來的新鮮味了；除了還可以拿去作「滴鈴子」之類小蟲兒的食料外，人可不要吃的吧？有時還間雜着爛了的菱，當然更說不過去了。因此，我在這裏從來就没有吃過一次的鮮菱。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>料理兩個字，就是菜餚的義，日本料理就是東洋人所的菜餚，余留東六年，對於日本的情形，比較還熟，平時很注意該國的風俗習慣，起居飲食，留東時每逢星期日假期，必隻身出門去考察社會狀况。所交的朋友，除同學外，也有在裁判所當科長的，也有在會社做買辦的，又有在學校裏擔任幾位敎課的先生，他們不分師弟，很願意與我同游的，本下校長志田博土·吉野博士·太田漢文學者，都是我的先生的朋友。因爲我是一個自費生，不時的可由家庭供給一些資斧，比他們限定七十元一月的官費生，的確寬舒得多，所以揮霍的錢，當然不計較錙銖的。而且所交的朋友，大半的中流以上的階級，平常與他們應酬，自然免不掉，吃過的日本菜，在六年中，已不知次數了。（普通的留學生，大半住在中國人開的旅館裏，或住在日本人經營用中國廚房的下宿屋，或租了一間房子（貸間）由房東供給膳宿的）他們平日所吃的飯，大都是不東不中的菜·現在我把日本人所吃的菜與吃的方法，說給讀者一聽，因爲有許多朋友同事知好們，常常來問我，都想去嘗試一下，我再三告訴他們，如去吃日本料理，必定要作三日嘔，不如去買塊臭頭腐乾吃，比較入味，然而他們總不見信，現在把各種菜的名稱寫出來，就可以明白了。不過有幾樣菜，是模仿中國式的烹調，那還可以進口的，其他不中不西不三不四的奇怪菜，大半見而生畏，嗅而作嘔，食而要吐的。你們如不見信，不妨到各埠日僑經營的日本料理店去嘗試一下，那就會相信了，說到日本菜的種類，本來很多，普通的正菜，有二湯五菜，也有二湯七菜，三湯七菜的，一般中流階級以上的人家，都通行二湯五菜。其他非正式的料理與社會上習慣所用的，好像我國南北地方，依各處的風俗而有加减不同的。</p>
<p>（一）二湯五菜的正菜　這種正菜，可以代表日本料理的全體，各式各樣的味道，大概都完備的，若到料理店去吃，每客起碼五元以上十元以下，正菜上菜的次序，分爲四次，第一次呌做吸物意即羹湯，日本人呌做絲衣目諾，爲一蓋碗一盆一碟，中有羹一碗，是一種鯛魚與笹瓜等混合所煮，又有酢物，意即醋菜，是鯛魚海苔混合煮成的，還有一盆取肴，意即醬燒魚，是用鯛魚用鹽醬大燒的。第二次上的菜呌做本膳，就是正菜的意義，爲一蓋碗一大碗一碟，中有羹一碗，是麵粉，香菌碎，山芋等混煮的，）生魚片（是一種錙魚片·紅蚶肉·白蘿蔔·海苔·香菌·防風·生姜末等盛在一大盤中）壺菜（係大蝦·百合·香菌絲等混煮）香物（是生的青菜蘿蔔生薑醬菜等，）第三次三碗，稱曰二膳即扁平碗（是黄魚·蝦·冬茹·山芋·三葉菜混煮）猪口杯（是紅根山芋燒貝肉等混合）湯，（用蕪青·蘭花合煮，）第四次有一大盆，稱曰三膳（是火燒鯛魚）吃正菜的方法，他們在家請客宴會，普通都用二湯五菜，不過烹調法，因遺風不同，有仿公卿的四條流式，有仿武家的小笠原流式，就是上菜的先後，亦不一定，例如將吃羹湯時，那女用人就拿出酒來了，（日本各處不用男僕）日本酒的正宗清酒銘酒，與我國的玫瑰露酒略似，味甜而香，上酒時，由女用人用兩手把酒瓶捧上來，這時男子用左手，女子用右手拿起杯來，由他注酒，第一次冷酒呌做冷酒吃後，又有𤏐酒（就是燙熱的酒）假使不飲酒的人，也不可絕對拒絕，應當假裝吃了一兩口的樣子，其後如再來注，那可以婉言謝絕。</p>

<h3 id="c226">不關宇宙或蒼蠅 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 維敬</p>
<p>自從「人間世」的發刋詞上有「宇宙之大，蒼蠅之微，皆可取材」那樣的話，遂惹起了一番論爭。綜合那論爭的要點，似乎有兩種：一是以爲小品文應該大處着眼，小處落筆，篇幅卽使短小，却應得「袖裏有乾坤」；這是不滿意「人間世」談蒼蠅之微的，倘使要給牠一個名目，那麽，稱之曰「宇宙派」，亦未始不可。又一是「人間世」方面的論調了，發刋詞中所謂「特以自我爲中心，以閒適爲格調」，似乎就是一聯標語。</p>
<p>照「人間世」方面此種主張看來，可知他們卽使取材於宇宙之大，也還是「以自我爲中心，閒適爲格調」的；而事實上也使我們頗信「人間世」確在謹守此「宗旨」。</p>
<p>然而世人不甚深察，遂以爲「人間世」專談蒼蠅，這已經是寃枉了人的謬論，不料最近有「太白」出板，一般人對照之下，譁然相告語曰：這是宇宙派來了！且看宇宙派和蒼蠅派各顯神通。此種「輿論」，並不表示對雙方有什麽愛憎，可是把「人間世」當作專談「蒼蠅」，却已顯明得很。</p>
<p>這是極大的誤會。「人間世」昭昭在人耳目，何嘗專談蒼蠅？牠最近談過宇宙之大的東西，不勝枚舉，不過談的立塲是「自我爲中心，閒適爲格調」而已。</p>
<p>所以假使因爲最近又出現了一本「太白」而我們來比較這兩種專登小品文的刋物的性質，那麽，問題應不在宇宙或蒼蠅之分，而在所謂小品文者是否應以「自我爲中心，閒適爲格調」？</p>
<p>我覺得小品文應該讓牠自由發展，讓牠依着環境的需要而演變爲各種格調，不該先給牠「排八字，算五星」。定要「宇宙之大」似的載「道」，固然是枷，可是「特以自我爲中心，閒適爲格調」，也是鐐鎖。「人間世」言小品文是想追踪公安竟陵的罷？在「方巾氣」瀰漫兩間的明朝，公安竟陵派的「性靈」「閒適」固然頗有點「解放」的味兒，但時代不同了，在這穢惡充塞的現代，小品文需要另一種的中心和格調，一味追踪前賢，不免是「自做枷來自戴」！</p>
<p>那麽，小品文是怎樣一種東西呢？說來並不是了不起的。牠只是用最經濟的筆墨寫出社會上的種種現象。可以是印象記，可以是「速寫」，可以是「小評」或「雜感」，……什麽都可以，只不能先給牠排定了「八字」是「自我」加上「閒適」。</p>
<p>時代會給小品文掙扎出一種最合宜的格調。談宇宙或蒼蠅，都可以；但假使「自我閒適」的眼光去談蒼蠅不爲時代所需要，那麽，同樣去談宇宙時，也未見其可。讀者是最後的評判人，羣衆並不是全然愚盲。</p>
<p>尼采式的超人的自信在「方巾氣」的混沌的社會内可以視爲不同流俗，但在一個思想分野很明顯的社會裏，則故意要不同流俗的超人姿態只恐不免成爲修正派的「方巾氣」了。在這上頭，好像標本之一就是辜鴻銘先生！</p>
<h3 id="c227">蟹粉包子 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>秋高蟹肥，有蟹子癮的詩人正好過癮。</p>
<p>我同一個朋友到南京路上買一點東西，回來的時候，正走冠生園經過。這位朋友忽然發起蟹癮來了，他説：</p>
<p>「我們到冠生園樓上吃隻蟹子吧。」</p>
<p>「吃蟹子非得喝酒不够味。」我告訴他。「我是生過腸胃病的人，吃酒吃蟹子都不相宜，我陪你坐罷。</p>
<p>「二人喝酒，二人看喝，喝了又有什麽味呢？那嗎，我們就到知味觀去吃一點特製的蟹粉包子，雞肉包子罷。」這位朋友又來一個提議。</p>
<p>「好的。」我們就走向知味觀了。</p>
<p>我想杭州的知味觀，點心小吃是很有名的，上海的知味觀却没有去過，不妨去試試。</p>
<p>他吃一碗麵，我吃一碗餛飩，包子却没有。他說：</p>
<p>「我很歡喜吃包子，長沙曲園的肉包子頂好吃，可惜走遍上海找不着那樣好吃的。不過上海好吃的蟹粉包子，長沙又找不到，蟹粉包子眞好吃哩！　　「他說話的時候，幾乎把饞涎流下來了。</p>
<p>我笑了一笑説：「蟹粉包子好吃，原是有詩爲證的。」</p>
<p>「你近來還有閒情　詩麽？」他忙插問一句。</p>
<p>「不是，我没有詩，詩興早給人家趕走了。」</p>
<p>「詩興眞是可以趕走的呀？」</p>
<p>「是的，北宋時代就有過」個這樣的笑話。潘大臨是和蘇東坡黄山谷頂要好的朋友，可是只有他最窮，他的詩倒還可以。有一天他有一個朋友寫信給他，問他新作的詩。他回信說，秋來景物，件件都是佳句。昨天無事睡下，聽了攪動樹林的風聲雨聲，忽然高興起來，把筆題詩。不料剛剛題完滿城風雨近重陽一句，催租的人到了，不覺掃興，再也寫不下去。你問我的新詩，止此一句奉寄。這個故事傳播出去，直以如今還是笑話。實在，我近來的生活也太給我爲難了。付了房租，又付巡捕捐，付了米錢又付煤賬，還有一羣兒女讀書。加以老婆因腸結核開刀，九死一生，還須療查；自己有個盲腸炎老毛病，正在等錢開刀。這樣的情形，難道止靠一枝秃筆可了？何况勉强拿筆寫出的東西未必會好，幸而寫出的東西通通賣去，有時候又剥削得你有嘴不能喊天。比如有一家雜誌最初徵稿是一律千字八元，等到生意好了，投稿的多了，改爲千字二元至十元，不過那爿書法每期付出的稿費總數還是和從前一樣。實在呢，本帮的千字拿到十元十五元，外帮的給他二元五元，剜人家的肉，醫自己的瘡；我是孤家寡人，没有帮口，不敢妄冀非分，原止希望他給我千字八元一個平均數，不料他止給我四元。倘若我的文章不合用，他不會向我要過稿子，也罷；再不然，我投給他稿子，不合用，他不要，給我退回，那也只好自己打自己的耳光，駡聲忘八羔子活該；爲什麽要了又貶價呢？」</p>
<p>「你又發起牢騷來了！快吃，餛飩冷了就不好吃的。」</p>
<p>「不是愛發牢騷，一直做文學癟三，不是出路。與其賣身投靠，投到文閥，那就改投什麽閥還不至於餓肚皮，反正文人是要賣身投靠的，不是投到甲階級，就要投到乙階級的呀。」</p>
<p>「得了，得了！文壇的黑暮重重，一時要說也說不盡，滿腔悲憤也没有用處。」這位朋友懷着同情的好意，好像不忍再聽下去，我也就不願再拿自己的不愉快引起人家的同感。</p>
<p>兩個人都喝着茶，相對默默地坐了一會。他從烟匣裏抽出兩枝烟，一個一枝，劃了洋火，燃着烟枝吸起來。他說：</p>
<p>「剛纔你道蟹粉包子好吃，有詩爲證，究竟是誰的詩呢」？</p>
<p>「記得是陸放翁的詩：蟹供牢九美，魚煮膾殘香」。我用指頭把牢九兩個字寫給他看，再繼續的說：</p>
<p>「放翁自注，……餅賦中所謂牢九，今包子也。還記得他有食野味包子詩：疊雙初鵠中，牢九已登盤。有人說，牢九應該作牢丸，一名蒸餅。宋朝諱丸字，去一點，便成牢九。但沿用已久，不知道是不是」。</p>
<p>「呵呀，牢九，蟹粉包子還有一個這樣古雅的名號。蟹供牢九美，魚煮膾殘香，我想那一天請你來吃蟹粉包子，糖醋鱖魚罷。但有一個條件，蟹粉包子的白話詩那是不可少的」</p>
<p>「好的，好的。」</p>
<p>兩人脫着，從知味觀出來了。他還歎息今天没有劈蟹喝酒，說是眞可惜哩！</p>
<h3 id="c228">珍珠姊（上） <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 陳學昭</p>
<p>每次往郵政局去，經過春暉堂，與旁邊的那個拐脚鞋匠開的鞋子店，我腦子裏又映起了珍珠姊的影子。我記得當年珍珠姊與我斷絕來往後，我從鞋子店前經過，認得出她的放在鞋店裏的已上好了底的鞋子，我總是感到一種惆悵，一種依戀的惆悵，這種惆悵，經過了如許的年月，還没有在我心中消滅。</p>
<p>珍珠姊是我在女高小裏的一個同學，我在進高小後的第二年才與她好起來的。丨丨我的小學是在一個男女同學的小學校裏讀完的，她呢，却是在這個女高小的附小裏讀完的，丨丨她常常與我的表姊一同到我家裏來玩。早上我們三人一同上學校，晚上又一同還到我家裏來。逢到假期，索性就幾天，幾十天的不還她們自己家裏去。</p>
<p>她從小就没了母親，父親是在一家中藥店做經理的，她的後母與她父親不很合頭，同時呢，父親姘上了家裏的女僕，一連産下了兩個男孩，珍珠姊呌他們做「弟弟」的，至於「弟弟」的母親，她呌伊做「朱媽」。在這麽一個家庭裏，她當然是一個多餘者，她平時的着落，就在她的外祖父家裏。外祖父是有錢的，有着好些市房，因之她穿着得很好，並且還戴了好些寳戒及金鐲，文明鐲…</p>
<p>珍珠姊時常在我家。不久，就有一個熟人來把她說給我四哥，我母親間了四哥，四哥不樂意，我四哥那時青春年少，非是一個有錢而漂亮的女子寗可不娶，我母親方面呢，也覺得不樂意，伊說珍珠姊的身體太壞了，的確，她又黄又瘦，背又駝了起來，並且大家都知道她有倒經，丨丨可是，我從來没有問過她究竟有没有倒經，只不過見她在每個月裏，總有幾天吐血，像我們吐痰那麽地容易的吐出來，一大口一大口的丨丨我呢，雖然我似乎下意識的感到這不是一個適合於我四哥的配偶，但我深心裏却是對於這事的不能成功，感到悵恨。</p>
<p>漸漸的，我注意到，在學校裏，珍珠姊對我没有先前的熱了，我請她到我家裏時，她總是唯唯否否的。我第一就猜想她大約懷疑做媒的不成，是我在母親，四哥前作的怪，我幾次决定要把這個我假設的冤曲對她伸明，說是我很仍舊愛她的，我仍舊要她到我家裏來玩的，……但我總找不到適當的機會。在這個時間裏，珍珠姊對我漸漸的淡起來，淡起來，淡起來，到後來，我注意到她對我的虚假的神氣，避忌我的情態，我便放棄了這個申明的决心，覺得這申明完全没有用處的了。不久，在另一個女同學口裏，我得知了珍珠姊常常在表姊家裏玩，她們是偷偷地瞞着我的，後來，她們結拜起姊妹來了，她的外祖父還替她倆取了兩個「結拜姊妹」名字：珍珠姊是姊，呌「才振」，表姊是妹，呌「才遠」，她們倆還公然的把這個名字用到國文修身等的課本卷子上了。在我幼稚的心裏，更增加了悲悵與失意，並且還被如火似的嫉妬燃燒着，我的心是如何地苦！我覺得她們倆完全是爲擯出我而結合了起來的，這麽想時，我更加覺得忿惱了，我的自尊心也受了傷。這是我在友誼上第一次的失敗，那印象深深的刻在我童年的心裏。</p>
<p>接着，爲了另一件事，又增加了珍珠姊與我間的隔膜，她與我的感情，從淡薄而特然的走上了斷絕的路。那是這樣的：我二哥愛上了我們高小裏的體操女敎員，一個從杭州基督敎的一個女子中學畢業出來的基督敎信徒，當珍珠姊常來我家的時候，我二哥要我與珍珠姊及表姊三個人去拉攏，在有人來爲四哥與珍珠姊說婚之前，事情拉得可說快成功了丨丨全部都是珍珠姊的力量，丨丨但是自從說親的不成功後，事情急轉而逆下，體操女先生不再邀我到她的房間裏去玩了，也不再偷偷邀我去吃東西，也不再問及我家中的一切，並且在上體操的時候，時常的校正我，一種冷冷的看不起我的神氣。反之，珍珠姊繼續的到女先生房間裏去，老半天不還出來，她們的笑聲在達到我們的自修室裏。珍珠姊以前常常跟着她的外祖父念經，唱那從和尙那裏學得來的「施食」的辭：「前代帝主，救苦怨魂，來受甘露味……」現在，可不了，她那啞啞的喉音，刻不離口的唱：「耶穌愛我，我愛耶穌……」她還把那個耶穌的「耶」字，不讀做「耶」字，學着女先生的敎會裏的洋音，唱做「鹽蘇」。一個女同學說她與女先生也結拜了姊妹，她的外祖父也替她們取了一對名字：女先生呌明揚，她呌明眞。</p>
<p>關於這件事，直到二哥結婚後，他於於我的忿恨丨丨恨我没有好好的爲他盡力丨丨才漸漸的隠去，初起的一個時候，二哥竟恨得我連話也不同我講的。後來，據母親對我說，丨丨她說是二哥自己在外面聽得來的丨丨這事完全是珍珠姊出的花樣，她去對那女先生說我母親是很凶惡的，而我家裏是信仰佛菩薩很恨基督敎的……母親接下說了伊的意見，覺得這完全是珍珠姊爲了與四哥配不成而抱恨我家，拿這個來報恨的。我總是半信半疑，有時我覺得母親未免太重視自己的兒子了，有時我又覺得珍珠姊很有出這個花樣的可能。</p>

<p>「阿召是給你打死了！阿召是給你打死了！我不要死了的骨骸，我要活的阿召呀！阿召是活生生地出去的，怎麽你們給我換了死的骨骸來呀！」</p>
<p>那女人哭着哭着，忽然又滾到地上去了。</p>
<p>像鬼也似的阿召的弟弟阿基，跟在嫂子後面進來。上氣不接下氣地說：</p>
<p>「阿哥是給土匪打死了，現在後備隊把他死骸槓在村頭放着。因爲找鄕警找不到，找到我家來了。」</p>
<p>「土匪？」每個人吃驚地呌出。「怎麽一會事？」</p>
<p>「是呀，土匪。」阿基打了一個呵欠，像剛才大烟還不够癮似的說，「今天早上，黑早的隊裏呌他們十多個人往城裏買菜去。每個人背着根竹槓子，好像槍桿子似的。事情也有凑巧。丨不過話要說回來，鄕裏土匪也是不曾絕跡過的。現在却越閙越兇了。他們走到下渡村，剛剛有批土匪在請財神，那裏離獅吼岩還祇十里路遠呢。土匪他們知道，在那里，有後備軍什麽的。一看到這十多個背着竹槓子底傢伙，以爲後備軍來追勦他們土匪了，乘這十多個人不備，拍拍啦啦放了一排槍，足足打死！四五個。阿哥　壳子裏中了個彈，打死了！……」</p>
<p>阿基說着說着！最後，兩脚像站立不住似地，蹲在地閥前一塊石上坐去了。</p>
<p>「我要活人呀！我要活人呀！」阿召老婆却還在地上滾。</p>
<p>「這是命！這是氣數！」大生先生搖着頭。「我想，我想，區裏總會有一點撫卹費吧！」</p>
<p>「我不要什麽撫卹費！我不要！我要活人呀！我要活人呀！活的活的人呀！」阿召老婆這回拖住鄕長馮文先生底脚了。</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>生存在這個時代，這個世界裏的人類，正好像是乘着帆船要渡過剛起着大風潮的海：而所乘的這種大小，新舊不同的帆船，又是分着「冰炭不相容」的上下等級；這裏面，當然是隨着各自的利害關係，而起的不可避免的内在矛盾；要渡的是：「歷史」的海，興起的正是「世界經濟恐慌」的狂風，「第二次世界大戰」的猛浪……看吧！這里呈顯着的：正是這個「時間」與「空間」的一副圖畫與縮影！</p>
<p>就像，從那次一九一四年起，一連上幾年的人類的大屠殺，正可以給吾們人類很大的敎訓。然而，平息了下來還没到二十年，種種的矛盾，危機却又四伏，那末，一般「預言家」，「星相家」們的預言着，推測着「危機」暴發的時期，以至地點，雖然，有的簡直是毫事實的根據，然而，這確正表示了這個時代與世界的亂動不安了。像所謂「一九三六年的危機」吧！一年多以前各國都已經在高喊雲霄，人心慌慌的了。單像牠自己點上了遠東火藥包的導火綫的日本帝國主義，牠爲這個「一九三六年」的問題，就我個人所見到的書籍，就有十餘種之多了。並且，日帝國主義者正天天利用着「廣播電台」在播送這「一九三六年」的危運，而來激動一般下層民衆的「愛國思想」，預備將來爲着祖國而去充「肉彈丸」的。可是回頭看看我國呢，本年一月到七月止，無綫電機的進口總值有一百四十萬金之多；然而，每日是够你消魂的送着「桃花江是美人窩……」，「甜密的夢……」，「不要你的金，奴奴只要你的心……」以至「××開篇」，「本公司新到××貨……」，這裏就够表示了「本國情調」，有閒者羣的</p>
<p>然而，關於「一九三六年」，並不是偶然而無因的。在一九二八年以後的「世界經濟恐慌」，「一九一八」的事變，日本的退出「國聯」，「軍縮會議」的没有結果，一九三五年「海軍條約」的期限等等，都是這個「危機」的直接的原因與起點！雖然，時期是並不會那麽死板的！</p>
<p>讀昨日的本報載紐的電訊，又有人在預言「世界大戰」了。據說這是一位「以熟悉德國情形著稱者」，「且能於事前兩星期預測希特勒清運動的史蒂爾氏」。今日他又預言明年就將發生「第二次世界大戰」，並且說戰事的發動，不能延過一九三五年之夏，因爲德國是再無力依據凡爾賽條約而對法付欵，因此，牠必要進佔薩爾，以奪回該地富庶之煤鐡礦。而那時的日本帝國主義，就將乘歐洲之亂而襲擊蘇聯，以保持其遠東之經濟覇權。</p>
<p>本來，在今日，我們是誰也得知道：在「世界經濟恐慌」與「國際政治危機」都跑上了尖端的時候，第二次人類的大屠殺，是必然要降臨到人世間的！所要緊的是：我們這些各各乘在危機四伏中的帆船裏的人類，將怎樣來殲滅了「内在的矛盾」，隨着這歷史的路綫，去波過麽驚浪駭濤的大風潮？</p>

<h3 id="c248">秋收 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 超人</p>
<p>阿元，你的租米怎麽老是延宕着？去年是荒年，讓你拖欠到年底，今年秋收並不差啊，佃户誰不上棧繳納清楚，你難不成還要拖日子？知趣些，快結清了也省我們多跑白步。</p>
<p>大叔，眞對不起，累你貴步，我倒茶來潤潤嘴，請坐下休息會兒吧。</p>
<p>坐當然要坐啦，老遠的爲你趕來，不要多嚕囌，快拿錢出來就是照應人了。</p>
<p>阿元在　泥茶人裏倒出一杯滾滾濃茶心裏却打算着怎樣應付目前的難關，聽到一陣緊一陣的催促，心裏跟着一陣緊一陣的恐慌起來。但是，望着他孩子的黄臉，望着那空的米桶，依舊打起熱望來哀求。</p>
<p>本來早應當來繳租了，祇是今年的收成也並不好，大旱了二十多天，你大叔是知道的，過後雖得些雨水，秧苗早已枯死大半了，這幸虧還是種的低田。</p>
<p>住了吧，不用多說，反正總不能算荒年，假如說幾句空話就讓你過去，往後租田的就不用預備大龍洋，祇要一張會說話的嘴了。</p>
<p>話是不錯，而且遲早總得繳清的，但是現在手頭實凑不起來，還望你大叔帮襯緩幾天。</p>
<p>哼！現在什麽日子了？三限都絕了，你簡直想吃租米，放明白些，吃租米就是犯法。没旁的話講，快拿錢出來便罷，否則，我回去在李仲老處没交代，也就不能用情了；仲老的名片是現成的帶你公安局去。</p>
<p>阿元這時候確是慌極了，他知道李田主的勢力，許多佃户都曾爲了欠租被他送到公安局去，但是一個錢也没有，又怎辦呢？急也没大用。他心裏忽然放寬了，反正是逃不了的命運，挺身子跟那催租賬房去吧。</p>
<p>好，吃官司也好，實在逼不出錢來，你大叔帶我上城也好。</p>
<p>狡滑的催租者不料他竟最後强硬起來，很可惜白費了一篇的恐嚇；雖然把一個欠租的佃户送官是很合理的，但對於阿元的窘况，原也很明白，空逼也逼不出錢來，還不如緩上幾天讓他去籌錢。祇是爲了尊嚴起見，也不便率直地降弱了語氣。</p>
<p>你倒說得好容易，官司不好吃的啊，坐了牢誰問你的家呢？我看你還是想旁的方法。</p>
<p>誰顧吃官司呢？唉，旣然你大叔照應，不知道能不能緩上幾天。</p>
<p>你要明白，我們也是用了人家錢，不能不這麽幹，並不喜歡和人作對。旣然這樣，逼也是没錢，現在特别給再展緩三天，三天後再没交代那就得不客氣了。</p>
<p>眞感謝你，我一定在三天中極力想法。</p>
<p>記住了，三天後不繳錢眞得辦你哪。</p>
<p>這是催租者臨走時的話，像在表示他辦事的鄭重。阿元心裏却着急三天後没錢怎交代呢？他看着米桶祇有嘆息。</p>
<p>三天會很易的過去，他望着他兒子的黄臉。</p>

<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>夜已經深下去了，弄堂裏像死水般的沉寂，没有聽賣零食的聲音，同居的小孩子們，也都靜靜地躺在床上，過着他們的好夢。這時自家正對着發黄的燈光，撑着瘦削的下巴，思索着文章的題材。</p>
<h3 id="c250">徐次釫先生法書 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>村墅落為話莭檯竹作　神清和月寫香　陷煙亦些樹圣餘韵為花無此姿詩人風味似梦寐也庭思</p>
<p>甲戌秋日</p>
<p>徐次釫</p>
<p>陡然間一陣尖削的寒風，沙沙地從窗口吹進來了，冷冰冰的，透過極薄的睡衣，使他打起了幾個寒噤。於是乎，這才深深地感到秋已深了。</p>
<p>秋天也許給人們認爲極美麗而又極有詩意的季節呵！肥的螃蟹，瘦的菊花，半斤黄酒，對月獨酌，等到醺醺然有醉意的時候，便起立引吭高歌，忘天地與忘我，過着半隠士式的生活。如果在深夜人靜的時候，新夢初醒，聽那疏疏落落的雨聲敲殘荷，所謂「留得殘荷聽雨聲」，此情此景，這是多麽合着詩人們的口胃，那末，就暫時做一下詩人也未始不可的。</p>
<p>秋天眞是一個美麗而又極有詩意的季節呵！</p>
<p>每天清早，從床上坐起來，翻翻剛送來的報紙，最惹人注目的是各大公司的秋季大减價的廣告，和電影院的如林的誘惑人的佳片。的確地，這秋天的季節比炎熱如焚的夏天委實好得多，坐在軟棉的沙發椅上是多麽的愉適丨同時，又再不會嗅得那種使人作嘔的鹹酸汗臭的氣味。特别是那些忸怩多姿體態輕盈的女人，在這秋高氣爽的秋天裏，倍覺得婀娜可愛。</p>
<p>然而，這些都是極少數人對於秋天所能得到的安慰與快樂的。在天災人禍雙重逼迫底下，農人們所眼巴巴盼望的秋收已告絕望了，眼看着他們的老家丨農村丨一天天加速度的破産下去，連吃飯的問題也都發生恐慌了，他們還有什麽閒情逸緻像那些吃飽飯没事做的詩人們一樣地來欣賞這美麗而又有詩意的秋天呢！而且天氣又是一天天的寒冷下去，他們的禦寒的冬衣不都是全送到當舖裏去嗎？可是，秋收已是絕望了，他們還有什麽能力可以把那些禦寒的冬衣從當舖裏弄出來呢？想到凛冽的冬天，這些窮人們又開始地對於悄悄降臨到人間的凉秋發愁了。</p>
<p>可恐怖的秋天呀！也許你是司殺着窮人們的命運的刑官吧。</p>
<p>隠約地，好像聽見那些無家可歸的窮人們，在深夜的街頭，浴浸在颯颯的秋風中不住地抖擻着，嘘嘘的嘆息的……</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>余係皖省婺源縣人。因有一困難之事，考慮數月，未得結果，故不得已請求先生代籌一解决之辦法。</p>
<p>在三年前，有族弟娶親，託余代向各方籌借數百元，借據上訂明在鄕間之杉木出售之日，歸償本息。照斯時之計算，以木價償此債，實綽有餘裕也。詎料年來農村不景氣，經濟破産，而販運浙杭之木客，因杉木缺少出路，又將木價降低，近來竟至無人顧問。以致木價清償債務之規約，無法履行，而利息則與日俱增。若宣告破産，鄕間又無律師代爲清算，自行攤派，又爲各債户所不許。如此情形，頗費躊躇。務懇代爲設法解决爲盼。專頌　撰安　信久上</p>
<p>編者按：根據來信所述，信久君似非担保人，依照法律殊無責任。但旣經辦理於前，在道德上言，自以代爲解决爲宜。</p>
<p>現時第一步須考查該項抵押品有無漲價之可能，一方面召集各債權人作誠懇之商酌。如抵押品無漲價之機會，欵又到期，則須先將抵押品賣出，不敷抵償之數，再商定日期，着債務人設法籌還。</p>

<h3 id="c256">一九三五年式汽車的新趨勢 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>一九三四式汽車。其結構·外表·和行駛。粗看起來。似乎盡善盡美。但是經過各國工程師嚴密的研究之下。牠們的缺點正多。例如車輛没有標準的格式。和車廂通風的陳舊等等。一切的一切。都期待着工程師的改進。而現在呱呱墮地的一九三五式新車。其優異之點。實爲吾人意料所不及。决非一九三四式舊車所能比擬的。一九三五式汽車之所以有如是的成績而被稱爲理想的車輛者。第一個原因當然歸於各國政府（英·美·法）對於汽車稅的减少（减少百分之二十）。此種輕稅的轉變。足以使一般購買小馬力汽車主人增加其購買力。例如本來買十四匹馬力。現在就可增到十八或二十匹馬力。此種馬力的轉變。眞接給車廠以更進的設計和製造。使工程師作更深一步的研究。而産生優良的汽車引擎。這是無可疑異的。</p>
<p>價格的低昻。和原料成正比例。近年各種原料的價格在猛烈的飛漲。所以一九三五式新車的價格。至少要比舊車要貴些。這也是不能避免的事。</p>
<p>在一九三四式汽車中。我們可以看到各種不同而奇樣的汽車。例如火箭形。橄欖形等等。但是在一九三五式的新車中。這種現象絕對不會尋到。因爲工程師都同意的承認。這種奇形怪狀的車輛。是各汽車廠炫耀同業的表示。其結果每使引擎和車身的構造敷衍了事。不能得到優異的成績。故一九三五式新車是屬於「標準化」的條件。工廠方面都務求車身構造的精密堅固。放棄外表的競爭。</p>
<p>獨立彈簧制在一九三四式車中雖已稍稍採用。但是漫無標準。且都未作完全的試騐。成績當然遜色。一九三五式新車則不然。雖很小的彈簧。都經過靜力和動力的試騐。引擎發動後的振動輻。减至極小。前後輪軸的支架。都附有吸振夾層橡皮簧。雖行駛粗劣的道路。車廂亦無劇烈的顚簛。</p>
<p>車廂的通連。近年來不乏工程師的研究。始得到美滿的結果。一九三五式汽車。都已採用。車廂的窗是用二層玻璃嵌成。内層可以自由上落。外層則裝有樞軸。可以向外推成任何角度。這樣一來。空氣的流通。完全在車廂的四周。阻力和空氣壓力。都大大的减少。</p>
<p>新車的長度比舊車增加約百分之二十。寬度約增百分之十。流綫化的程度。大概與舊車相髣髴。不過來得平均一點。</p>
<p>輪胎截面的增加。雖然從前經過許多工程師盲目的反對。現在已大告成功。一九三五式新車的輪胎空氣總體體。較舊車增加百分之五丨七。因而載重亦增加百分之廿三丨三十。此種成績。頗堪驚人。</p>
<p>斯車轉動部分的啣接。皆利用最新式的滾軸制。金屬面積的摩阻力。當然隨着减少。各軸部分都有自動注潤器灌注滑油。此種滑油遇過剩時。能以極快的速率流回中央總注潤器。絕對没有漏濺等的損失。引擎的制動。是利用最新式的電磁綫圈感應。任何外界温度都没有影響。電壓的控制。和電量的分配都有精密的機件管理。所以電動機的能力和效率。格外的大。這點也是一九三五式斯車的特點。</p>
<p>總之。雖然新車的價格略昻。但是因爲車稅的减少。使車廠製造興奮。所以有這樣的成績。這「標準化」的新車行將傾銷汽車市塲受一般人熱烈的歡迎。這是無可疑異的。</p>

<p>金景斯君。爲著名汽車駕駛能手。關於距離。速率。及耐久等。各種競賽之美國汽車聯會紀録。氏所創造者。爲數獨多。若其餘駕駛。蓋皆瞠乎其後。無一能及之者。而尤爲難能可貴者。即氏雖屢次造成最高紀録。但從無一次肇禍是也。迺者氏以關於行車安全問題。所提供之意見六點。爲文刋載於新近出版之扶輪雜誌。爰特照譯如下。以供關心汽車駕駛安全者之參考。</p>
<p>（一）應以雙手管理轉向輪　就余所知。世之精於單手駕用雙手管理轉向輪也。</p>
<p>（二）應以最佳之胎裝配於前輪　前輪爆裂危險較多。如果不幸發生爆裂。惟堅握轉向輪。乃可避免危險。</p>
<p>（三）應常檢騐塞車　余旣駕車啟行。則在第一百碼内必常踏下脚踏板。以檢騐塞車。蓋以塞車或竟冰凍。或嫌膠膩。或則亟須校準也。</p>
<p>（四）天色矇矓之時駕車尤宜審愼　於晨光熹微或暮色蒼茫之時。駕車疾馳。則肇禍之可能性。必倍蓰於清晨或日中。推原其故。當然由於視綫不甚清楚。吾人並須切記撞車致命之案件。其發生於夜間者蓋較白晝增多百分之四十二。</p>
<p>（五）滑行時不必應用塞車。</p>
<p>（六）應隨時注意道路情形。</p>
<h3 id="c258">二十年來道奇車的進步 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>道奇車廠。我們大家知道。在汽車界。已有很悠久的歷史了。一九三四年更是道奇廠二十周紀念。在過去的二十年中。道奇車廠已有很顯著的進步。而到了現在。道奇的出品。已蜚聲汽車界了。在汽車界方面。所佔的地位。已一天高似一天。到而今已有領袖的資格。道奇廠所以有今天這樣的地位。唯一原因。就在廠方所施營業政策的穏定。出品的優美。所以二十年來。道奇廠的歷史。也就是道奇車的全部發達史呢。</p>
<p>道奇六缸汽車的勝人一籌。是二十年的中間努力改進後所得的收獲。而「浮力」在各種發明和改進之中。更是一種特殊的成績。道奇的車身。完全是用獨幅純鋼製成的。所以一般的人。已確認道奇車身。是一種最安全的車身。安全玻璃。更予開車的。乘車的。一種極大的安全。而在本年度。新車之中。改革的地方。最顯著的一點。便是前輪獨立懸置。爲了有獨立懸置的裝置。車輛在路上行駛的時候。可以免去一切傾側。倒退的震力。而結果。可予任何車主以一種意外的安全穏快。</p>
<p>在通氣方面。新式無風通氣的發明和採用。比較歷來道奇車上所採用的任何通氣系統來得進步。爲了有這種新的裝置。車窗可以完全使之低落。包括通風部分和獨立通風。在表板之上。由一個曲柄司動作的六缸道奇車上的引擎是巨大而有力。而且是非常的光澤。現在更採用七點配重的曲柄棍。單就這些。已可使我們感到道奇新車在形式上。在機構上。已都有很顯著的進步呢。</p>
<p>一九三四式道奇六缸車的流綫。不但長而低。而且更非常均衡。墊靠和裝璜。一切的一切。都是漂亮而摩登。不拘車内車外。式樣都是很好。在於構造方面。爲車身以獨幅純鋼製成。所以好比一雙鋼製的船身。用電桿的方法。所以接縫的地方。裂縫全無。所以安全堅固。爲任何新車的車身所不及。鋼内隔鋼。實爲一九三四式新車中最堅固的一種車輛。</p>
<p>道奇車廠除了客車之外。更以製造貨車著名。這也是盡人皆知的。製造貨車。道奇廠也已有十八年的歷史了。在製造貨車的過程中。道奇廠始終顧到實業界方面。能够因爲購用道奇貨車而節省費用。憑着豐富的經騐。直到現在。所以的出品。一般的人。都已承認確能超越其物質上的優美。和工程上的便利。製造的技術。非常巧妙而精美。一切設備。又應有盡有。所以實業界一經採用道奇運貨車而後。我們可担保其費用。一定能低减不少。因爲運貨的迅速和簡易。無論在燃料上。維持費上。及原來的投資上。都會感到非常的經濟呢。</p>

<p>— 雪萊</p>
<p>增築汽車大道五條</p>
<p>最近法蘭西政府預備拿一○·○○○·○○○·○○○法郎。作修進道路的費用。所有這筆鉅大費用的支配方法。也已經决定了。這經費中間的半數。是用來建築新的道路網。接通到巴黎的外面。和在巴黎區中的道路築造。還有一半用來增進全法蘭西的公路。而最重要的呢。是在銷滅各處的地平交叉點。</p>
<p>拿全部經費中的半數作爲建築和增進巴黎的道路。這個費用似乎是很鉅大的了。不過我們要曉得。在法蘭西國中的道路。重要的公路固然不用說。就是次要的道路。在大部份上都是情形非常好的。所以除了所述的特殊目標之外。實際上無需用鉅大的支出來修增道路。因爲巴黎的情形。和前面所講的截然相反。所以急切的增修是很緊要的。通到巴黎京城外的各條主要道路。在最近的幾年間。交通的擁擠的情勢。已經增至頂點了。今年夏季。要是遇到星期六或者星期日的話。來往道上的擁塞阻滯。常常延長里許。其交通被阻的情形。可想而知了。增進巴黎道路的計劃。包括建築五條行駛汽車的大路。從市間四散出去。和郊外環市的大路互相銜接起來。五條中間三條公路的工程。據聞不日便好開工哩。</p>
<p>上面所說的三條要道。一條是大西路。一條是大南路。還有一條是北路。因爲鑒於巴黎的形勢。在地理上實爲大陸空航的交集點。所以北路直通到布爾聶飛機塲。南路的開端處將在現有的阿百瓊和芳丹卜羅兩路之間。這兩條道路上目下車輛交通十分擁擠。上面所說的阿百瓊路直通到哇林士和波爾多。芳丹卜羅這一綫直達里昻和法蘭西南部。</p>
<p>不論日間或是夜間。在上面所講的幾條路上。車輛交通都是一樣的很爲擁擠。不過在巴黎附近情形尤爲複雜。因爲郊外的車輛交通。大多以運貨車輛爲多數。這樣一來。車輛的來往交通。不是更要麻煩麽。如果新開闢的大路完成之後。那末上述的車輛擁擠困難情形。就不難解除。因爲計劃上是要把新路迤出巴黎二十英里。然後和現有的路互相銜接。</p>
<p>新西路將發端於休生士。從布龍奇去過橋就可到達。與雷寳萊卡德路相接。直伸至法蘭西西部。另外還和旁多士底潑路相接。除了上面兩條路之外。第三條大路雖然較短。但却十分重要。這條路將從鮑及脫伸巴黎和北面的（山力士）大路相銜接。這樣一來。吾們在巴黎和各重要空港之間就有最快捷的地上交通了。</p>
<p>除了新的蛛網路之外。尙有很多的築路工程關與巴黎本身和四郊的。也已在計劃進行之中。在郊外現在尙有許多地平交叉點。不久就都要被剷除的。塞納橋就要加以寬放。在舊有的堡壘綫上存留着。將因墜地的關係而使交通礙塞爲之解除。</p>
<p>因爲陶斐思港埠的墜地有顯著的成功。市政當局現已着手添加其他墜道。像人家已經知道的梅洛脫和姜百萊兩港埠的墜道。完成之期已不在遠。大概其中的一道或兩個墜道。在明年必能全部竣工。同時交通擁擠的難題。也就連帶的解决。從梅洛脫出進巴黎的車輛交往。向來是很繁複的。尤其在週末。那就格外的不容易解决。</p>
<p>凡立脫港的一條新墜道。早已開工了很多的時候。在今年内是無論如何要</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>完成啟用的。這樣一來。到鮑及脫航空埠的地面交通就可疏散不了。還有兩處同樣性質的墜道。也已在建築之中。一個伊太里。一個在克里起。這兩處地方向來是車輛交通的擁擠集中點。不過此外尙在一個墜道在計劃之中。這條墜道將築於卡羅塞爾港的塞納灘下面哩。</p>
<p>開於利用墜道來解决交通繁複的困難。不但在市内是努力進行着。就是在郊外也一樣的很爲注意。他的效用是想把墜道來滅削郊外地面交叉點。並在地底下是火車交通而不是路上交通。在卜士珂侖勃士和阿溪士交叉處。兩個便是很好的例子。那個地方本來有一百碼地位的三個地面交叉點。汽車駕駛者經過了一個栅門之後。又連續的在短道間的第二道栅門之前了。第一道的栅門這時候已在車後關閉。於是好像一隻牛一隻羊般的。裝閉在栅欄裏。至少要等上二十五分鐘。或者還要多點。始能通過。</p>
<p>法蘭西的市政工程是非常發達的。所以上面所說的困難和複雜的改進。都不難很有效的表現出來的。</p>
<h3 id="c263">談汽車式樣的轉變 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>汽車到了最近，非但視作爲一件交通器具，並且是視作爲一件美麗宏壯的物件了，因爲汽車是一種視作爲美麗宏壯的物件，於是一般的汽車商都極力的設法去改良外觀上的美麗，而外觀上的美麗，那就是汽車的式樣問題這恐怕是現在的汽車最重要之一事，如果一個汽車的購主在買汽車的時候第一件事情那就是注意到汽車的式樣了，</p>
<p>如果是一個汽車製造業專家，在他口頭上的汽車，常常可以聽到一九三○式，一九三三式，或者一九三四式之類，可見式樣是現在的汽車所持爲最主要的一個條件了，汽車的式樣每年一換，日新而月異，於是一般汽車製造家都設盡方法去力求改良，這改良的結果，使汽車的式樣産生了一種轉變的趨勢，從一種的樣式漸漸到了他種的樣式去了，</p>
<p>如果說大汽車，那有大汽車的式樣，因爲現在的世界是經濟恐慌的世界，於是所有的趨向都向經濟一方去，因之汽車亦不得不向經狀的傾向，如奥司汀汽車，本以小汽車著名，在這時期内大施其改革的方針，使小汽車在市上活躍着，星球牌汽車亦同時出新鮮的小汽車卽以福特汽車亦有小汽車之新式樣問世，其他牛牌，喜臨門，納喜等汽車亦有小汽車之最新式樣，可見趨向的一般，所有的汽車製造業在此時期之内皆受此趨向的波及了，</p>
<p>但是在一般的汽車式樣轉變而言，那是大小汽車一例的，在十年之前汽車的式樣是崇尙高的車身，和短一些的長度的，那時候所有的汽車，都是十分高昂的，因爲車身的高昻，所以下面的車底盤亦因之而高昻了，車身的四周在轉角之處，因爲那時候是主張以方角爲美觀，於是所有的車頂角都是方的，這樣的一輛車子，在那時是非常時髦的，當然現在在無論那一個汽車製造廠中都找不出這同樣的一輛車子來，而且市上有了這樣的車輛時一定要被人覺得非常難看的，然而在十年之前，這種式樣是認爲汽車之中最美觀的，現在仍舊可以找出幾輛來，像老的林肯車以及派克車，到現在仍舊很牢固，但是車身式樣已老極的，在市上尙有可見，雖然式樣非常難看，但是這種汽車的價值非常昻貴，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Draft Constitution Passed by the Legislative Yuan After Third Reading, Totaling Twelve Chapters and One Hundred and Seventy-Eight Articles, Minor Textual Amendments Made, No Changes in Content, Motions to Amend Prior to Third Reading Failed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 74th meeting at 9 a.m. on the 16th to continue deliberating the draft constitution. More than 60 people, including Lin Bin, attended. Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting's opening and stated that if any committee members had proposals before the third reading began, they could submit them to the general assembly for discussion according to procedure. Subsequently, Chen Changheng and others proposed amendments to Article 3, which, after fierce debate among the committee members, was maintained in its original form. Next, Wei Tingsheng and others requested an amendment to Article 98 concerning impeachment cases against the President, Vice President, and heads of various branches, stipulating that they must be reviewed by more than three-quarters of all supervisory committee members and decided by more than two-thirds to be submitted. Luo Dingtao, Xuan Lüzhi, and others believed that this amendment hindered the exercise of supervisory power, and as a result, the original draft was maintained. Shi Weihuan and others proposed adding a clause to Article 112, "Deliberating on provincial taxes and matters increasing the burden on the provincial treasury," to enrich the supervisory authority of the provincial councils over provincial finances, but it was not approved. Finally, Zhang Guoyuan and others proposed adding a clause requiring national education to adopt and read books on the country's inherent culture. Wu Jingxiong and others greatly supported Zhang's proposal and supplemented it, but the majority of the committee members believed the idea was excellent but unnecessary to stipulate in the constitution, and it was not approved. The meeting adjourned at 12 p.m. The third reading began at 4 p.m. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's general assembly on the 16th discussed the draft constitution, making slight textual modifications, but without altering the content.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan passed the draft constitution in its third reading from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on the 16th.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the selection of the ambassador after the elevation of our embassy in Italy, it is heard that our government intends to promote Liu Wendao, the current minister to Italy, to the first ambassador, and has obtained the Italian government's consent. It is now reported that this case has been passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 16th and will be formally announced after being approved by the Central Political Council on the morning of the 17th, with a clear order of appointment by the National Government.

<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi stated that the method for converting the silver price after implementing the export tax on silver will be determined daily by the Central Bank based on the fluctuations of the London silver price and the exchange rate of shillings, converting it into an accurate silver market price and notifying the customs as the standard for collecting export taxes. This is a highly flexible measure, with the overall goal of preventing the outflow of silver. As for the exchange of notes with the US government on the silver issue, the US government has formally replied to the Ministry, with a very positive attitude, expressing its willingness to cooperate with China and to consider China's economic impact within its possibilities, and hoping that China will discuss this issue together. However, the US has its own environment, claims, and objectives in this matter. Regarding friendly relations, they are extremely willing to help us. Therefore, in our country, we not only consider the shifting environment but also seek our own consolidation methods at any time. Initially, there is no fixed method, but the principle is to stabilize our entire economy. As for the recent progress of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, a small batch of rice has been purchased in Hunan and transported to Hankou. Personnel have also been dispatched to Wuhu for procurement, with the amount depending on the local harvest, in order to achieve the goal of diverting surplus from some areas to supplement shortages in others. The procurement method is to purchase directly from farmers, without involving merchants, so that farmers receive tangible benefits. Currently, while procurement is underway, we are also waiting for the autumn harvest in various regions to assess the extent of disasters and shortages in each province before transporting grain for affordable sales. Otherwise, if the early rice harvest is good, or there are remaining stores from last year's abundant harvest, or if the situation at the time of the autumn harvest is still favorable, the situation will be carefully considered to avoid the phenomenon of starvation in one area and crop failure due to low prices in another.

<p>(Nanjing) At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 16th, Kong Xiangxi reported on the issue of collecting silver export tax, stating that the increase in silver prices in Washington and the large outflow of silver in Shanghai are related to the future of China's finances and are of major importance. He expressed concern that the market would be disrupted in the future and become uncontrollable. Therefore, he submitted a note to the US government to discuss remedies for the silver market in the Far East. At the same time, after Minister Shi exchanged views with the US authorities, the US replied to our response. He stated the original text and believed that all personnel measures had been exhausted. Now, in order to prevent serious changes in the financial market in the future, the implementation of the silver export tax from the 15th is currently the only way to save the situation. He also explained other responses to future developments and strict prevention of smuggling. Kong will attend the Central Political Council meeting on the 17th to report on this issue and the emergency measures taken by the Ministry of Finance, requesting retroactive approval for the collection of silver export tax.

<h3 id="e5">Further Documents on the Silver Issue Released, Glimpses of British and American Opinions <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Another exchange of notes between the Chinese and American governments regarding the silver issue has now been released simultaneously by agreement of both parties. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>On August 19, 1934, President Roosevelt, through Consul General Kunningham, sent a message to Minister Kong, stating that the London Silver Agreement signed by your representative in July 1933 has recently been approved by your government. Its purpose is to stabilize silver prices, as there was a concern that the Indian and Spanish governments' holding of large amounts of silver would endanger silver prices. The Silver Purchase Act of 1934 also has the same concern about affecting silver prices and your country's interests. In order to protect its finances, your country wishes our government to clarify its future silver purchase policy.</p>
<p>On October 1, 1934, US Consul General Kunningham wrote to Minister Kong, stating that he received a telegram from the State Department on September 22 stating that the US government is very willing to explain its silver policy to the Chinese government. The US silver purchase policy is based on the following points: The Silver Purchase Act of 1934 stipulates that the gold-silver ratio of currency reserves should be one-quarter silver as the final goal. The Ministry of Finance should purchase silver to achieve this goal at a certain time, under certain conditions, and under certain circumstances that it deems most beneficial to the public interest. The US government believes that this measure is to implement the resolution of the second group of the Currency and Financial Committee on July 20, 1933. The US government understands that when implementing the Silver Purchase Act, great attention should be paid and it is clear that excessively high silver prices will have an unfortunate impact on domestic and foreign finance. The US government should be willing to avoid actions that could hinder other governments from protecting silver reserves. If the Chinese government at any time deems it necessary to crack down on silver exports, our government is willing to accept the Chinese government's opinion so that the government can carry out its silver purchase law according to the Chinese government's policy. (National Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the newspapers paid close attention to the Chinese government's plan to curb silver exports. The Financial News stated that China has now moved away from the silver standard. China currently has no silver export points, so China has no silver exports that can be used for short selling. Therefore, future fluctuations in China's exchange rate will not be tied to changes in silver prices. No matter how low the Shanghai silver dollar falls, it will never result in silver being shipped out. The Financial Times stated that, judging from yesterday's market trends, China's repeated efforts to curb the unfavorable reactions caused by President Luo's silver policy have not had much impact. The London Times editorial stated that increasing the silver export tax may prevent the outflow of Chinese silver reserves, but it may not be easy for China to prevent its currency from rising due to tightening while the US government continues its current policies and speculators continue to manipulate the market. The Times' Washington correspondent stated that, according to the opinion of Washington Treasury officials, China's increase in silver export tax is the first step towards a ban. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently declared that the Chinese government's increase in silver export tax is only enough to make the United States buy silver at a higher price, meaning that there is no way to stop it. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) China has suggested exchanging gold and silver with the United States. Therefore, the Associated Press inquired about opinions from well-informed observers in Washington. They believed that the Chinese government can obtain a large amount of cash without hindrance. China can exchange gold and silver in the gold and silver markets in London. Although the United States prohibits gold exports, it does not prohibit exports to countries on the gold standard. Therefore, if China adopts the gold standard as stated in its note to the United States, it is also permissible to transport gold to China. However, most of the silver in China is privately owned rather than government-owned, which may cause difficulties. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>US Senator Thomas of Missouri spoke to the Associated Press correspondent here today, saying that the Chinese government's move to collect export tax to prevent the outflow of silver is very clever. He believes that China's method of self-defense is much smarter than that of the United States. The US purchase of silver has caused China's currency to rise, resulting in lower prices, just like the world's purchase of gold ten years ago, which harmed the United States. However, it took the United States ten years to find a way to remedy it. Thomas, the leader of the expansionist faction in the Senate, believes that the effect of China's increase in silver tax is still uncertain for the time being. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Xi'an) At 9 a.m. on the 15th, all sectors of Xi'an's party, government, and military held an expanded memorial week for Dr. Sun Yat-sen at Minle Garden. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Madam Soong Mei-ling, Deputy Commander Zhang, Secretary-General Yang, 84th Division Commander Gao Guizi, 7th Army Commander Feng Qinzao, Chairman Shao, Director Yang, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, heads of departments of the Provincial Government, heads of departments of the Pacification Headquarters, and representatives from various agencies, groups, troops, and schools, totaling approximately 2,000 people, were presided over by Chairman Chiang, with Peng Zhenhuan of the Provincial Guidance Committee serving as master of ceremonies. After performing the rituals, Chairman Chiang delivered a sincere speech, moving the listeners. The ceremony ended at 10:05 a.m. After the memorial week, Chairman Chiang received Song Zhixian, Yang Hucheng, Peng Zhenhuan, Li Chi, Zhang Danbai, Wang Jingxuan, Guo Yingfu, and others from the Provincial Guidance Committee at Minle Garden, inquiring in detail about party affairs in Shaanxi. At 10:15 a.m., accompanied by Deputy Commander Zhang, Secretary-General Yang, and others, and guided by Chairman Shao and Director Yang, they walked through the Revolutionary Park. First, they ascended Guangming Tower, overlooking the park's scenery, and then went to the Martyrs' Cemetery. Shao and Yang gave a detailed account of the park's history and proposed renovation plans. At 10:40 a.m., still accompanied by Shao and Yang, they traveled in nine cars to visit the Provincial No. 1 Library. At 10:55 a.m., they inspected the Provincial Party Headquarters and then passed through Nan Yuan Men, Ma Fang Men, Zhu Ba Shi, and arrived at the Drum Tower. Chairman Chiang led the staff to stop and tour the tower. After the tour, he praised it as a great building. At 11:25 a.m., he inspected the Provincial Government. Provincial government officials and military bands were waiting at the gate. Amidst the melodious sound of military music, Chairman Chiang walked into the chairman's office for a brief rest, then went around the back garden to the gate, and proceeded to West Five Terrace for a tour. At 12:40 p.m., he returned to the headquarters, took a short rest, and then had lunch. At 3:50 p.m., still guided by Shao and Yang, he went to the Tonghua Building Disabled Veterans Rehabilitation Center for inspection. Yuan Jihan, the director of the center, led all the officers and rehabilitated disabled veterans to line up and welcome him. Chairman Chiang inspected the entire center and earnestly comforted the seriously injured and disabled. Finally, he summoned all the officers of the center for a speech, generally stating that managing disabled veterans is even more difficult than managing regular soldiers. Not only must their material needs be comforted, but their spirits must also be comforted. Those with families can be allowed to return home once every year or half a year to reunite with their families. During their time in the center, they should be educated and rehabilitated in a timely manner to maintain the noble character of soldiers and to follow the diligence, simplicity, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace in the New Life Movement. He did not return to the headquarters until 5:10 p.m. At 8 p.m., he summoned Feng Qinzao, Commander of the 7th Army and concurrently Commander of the 42nd Division, and gave instructions. Madam Chiang, after attending the memorial week this morning, visited the Orphanage and the Women's People's Vocational School, accompanied by Madam Shao, and was commended. At 5 p.m., she invited Madam Yang, Madam Shao, and Yang Shuji, Director of the Poor People's Anti-Smoking Institute, to discuss the establishment of a women's anti-smoking institute. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Chairman Chiang's speech at the expanded memorial week for all sectors on the 15th was titled "Impressions of Traveling in Shaanxi and Hopes for Shaanxi." The original speech was three thousand words long, and the general meaning is roughly as follows: Shaanxi, especially Chang'an, is the birthplace of Chinese culture and the birthplace of the Chinese nation. Since Emperor Huangdi established the country, from the Zhou Dynasty onwards, the Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties all used Chang'an as their capital. At that time, the Chinese nation's martial arts and culture were continuously promoted and reached their peak. Therefore, not only should the people of Shaanxi recognize the glory and greatness of this national history and resolutely take the responsibility of revitalizing the nation, but also visitors from afar, seeing the great achievements of their ancestors in building the country and developing the nation, will surely know that the Chinese nation has the greatest creative ability and the most glorious cultural history. With deep feelings for the past, they cannot help but feel the changes of today and yesterday. Now, domestic and foreign troubles are coming one after another, and the country has fallen into a critical situation of survival. Our ancestors had great intelligence and spirit to achieve great undertakings. As their descendants, we should be able to carry on the past and open up the future and do the same. However, the nation is now weak and the country is in danger. The reason is that the general public has forgotten the greatness of our ancestors and the glory of national history, forgotten their own nation's inherent greatest intelligence, highest morality, most excellent culture, and most precious spirit, and even forgotten the great foundation and magnificent rivers and mountains left by their ancestors. Therefore, they have lost the inherent soul of the country and nation, cannot respect or trust themselves, and cannot strive for progress. The status of the country and nation is declining and in danger, and the general public is still unaware of the need to awaken, strive, strengthen themselves, and save themselves to take on the great task of national salvation and revitalization. Shaanxi is the birthplace of sages and heroes of the past dynasties since Duke Zhou, King Wen, and King Wu. It has always been known as a land of civilization and etiquette. Duke Zhou made rituals and music, so that ancient Chinese politics, education, and culture were fully prepared, which also began in Shaanxi. The land is still here, and the people are still here, but the cultural relics of the past and the old rites and music are gone. Many people also inevitably neglect the inherent eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace of the Chinese nation, as well as the four dimensions of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, which are the fundamental spirit of the country for thousands of years. If this is the case, how can our country and nation not be in danger? Now, if we want to save the country from danger and revitalize the nation, we must first restore the inherent soul of our country and nation, as well as the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace. To restore the eight virtues, express the eight virtues, and complete the eight virtues, we must first practice the four dimensions of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, especially starting with etiquette. With this sincerity and respect, we can naturally achieve the goal, and then build a new country of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the fundamental way to save the country and revitalize the nation in the future lies in practicing the four dimensions and restoring the eight virtues, and should be started from daily life at any time and anywhere. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation must all conform to etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame. In short, we must promote the New Life Movement and improve our lives according to the several standards of the New Life Movement. Simplicity and simplicity have always been the legacy of Shaanxi. In the future, we must do our best to achieve order, cleanliness, speed, and accuracy. The basic condition of these four standards is to be diligent. The people of Shaanxi have always been known for their chivalry, righteousness, courtesy, and shame. There have been many sages and heroes in Guanzhong throughout history. In recent times, the legacy has not declined, and there are many revolutionary martyrs. Therefore, Shaanxi should not be regarded as an ordinary province in terms of history, geography, culture, and politics. It is the most important foundation of the country and nation. In the past, King Wen of Zhou, King Wu of Zhou, Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, and Emperor Taizong of Tang all built great countries on the basis of Shaanxi and promoted the prestige of the nation. Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, were rarely comparable. Although the undertakings of Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, and Emperor Taizong were selfish and imperial, and not suitable for today's modern times, their spirit of promoting the national spirit and enhancing the history of China should be taken as self-respect by future generations, and everyone should have the confidence to revitalize the nation, and not abandon themselves. All comrades, especially the general youth, should know that being in China's era environment is the best opportunity for us to achieve great success and build great careers that are rare in a thousand years. Historical, geographical, and cultural conditions are all complete. The current era environment is even forcing us to be heroes who revitalize the nation. Now, as long as we can work hard and strive for self-improvement, we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation and complete the mission of the era we bear. This time I came to Xi'an, and I couldn't help but have infinite feelings. I will definitely be able to live up to my hopes for you to work hard and do your best to fulfill everyone's responsibilities. From now on, the future of the country and nation will definitely have unlimited light. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Silver Export Tax <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— A</p>
<p>Our Ministry of Finance announced yesterday that it would implement a tax on silver exports starting from the 15th of this month. The content of this tax can be divided into two layers. First, the basic silver export tax, including the casting fee for raw silver exports, requires a total tax rate of 10%. Second, the silver export equalization tax, which is the difference between the London silver price converted to the Shanghai exchange rate and the official Shanghai exchange rate. If it exceeds the aforementioned export tax rate, it will be levied at any time according to the excess amount. In this period of domestic economic difficulty, the long-standing silver problem can indeed be temporarily resolved with this method. Because this method will definitely deal a strong and significant blow to speculators who generally seek undue profits by exploiting price differences. The authorities' determination and decisive action are worthy of praise from the people.</p>
<p>However, considering the country's overall economic policy, further measures are still needed. The silver problem has not only domestic significance but also international significance. Silver is our currency standard and also a fairly important commodity in the international market. Therefore, practically speaking, the rise in silver prices has two meanings. First, based on the above foundation, the United States' silver policy clearly has its basic purpose. It aims to achieve its goal of reducing currency value through the method of raising silver prices. Because from the current situation in the United States, raising silver prices is equivalent to raising commodity prices. Under the relationship of rising commodity prices, the national wealth value of the United States can also be raised. This is the starting point of the United States' silver policy. We should know this today. Second, another meaning of rising silver prices is that the currency value of silver-using countries is becoming increasingly expensive, which means that the prices of goods in silver-using countries continue to decline. Therefore, the value of national wealth is also relatively reduced. This is the second point we should know. In terms of these two meanings, the current silver export tax policy seems to only be able to prevent a large outflow of silver. In addition to preventing a large outflow of silver, it is still necessary to establish other auxiliary methods to prevent the adverse effects of the United States' silver policy on Chinese commodity prices. How to remedy the impact of commodity prices cannot be achieved solely by the "silver storage" policy.</p>
<p>Originally, the core of economic policy lies in maintaining the commodity price level at a certain level, without abnormal fluctuations. Like the current rise in silver prices in the United States, the policy that China should adopt should not only prevent the impact of rising silver prices but also maintain the stability of commodity price levels. Therefore, we say that in addition to silver taxation, further necessary measures must be taken. This is an issue we believe is worthy of attention.</p>

More than 100 accounting personnel in charge of various agencies affiliated to the ministry attended. Chairman Pang Songzhou presided over the meeting as scheduled. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi personally delivered a speech, briefly stating that the ministry has heavy responsibilities.

How to strictly prevent corruption depends on the precision of the accounting system and the efforts of the accounting personnel. In addition to thoroughly understanding various accounting laws and regulations, accounting personnel must also have knowledge of financial statistics and be honest, meticulous, diligent, and sensitive. The key points of this conference are: first, to study the improvement and reorganization of the accounting system; second, to assess the talents of the various members and their usual performance in handling accounting matters, etc. Subsequently, Qin Fen and Pang Songzhou delivered speeches one after another. A group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. The conference received more than 20 proposals from various members, and the accounting department raised 15 questions for the conference to discuss. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Belgrade The impact of the Marseille massacre has suddenly turned sour, judging from the situation this morning. The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that the Yugoslavian Embassy in Budapest has received instructions to lodge a serious protest with the Hungarian government, saying that the Yugoslav government has proven that Hungary allows terrorist parties plotting to assassinate the Yugoslavian King and Yugoslavian government leaders within its borders. The protest is based on the confession of Hoszpis, an accomplice of Kalman, the murderer arrested by the French police. It is claimed that their training institutions are located in Hungary. Official circles here are also slightly uneasy about Italy's attitude because it is reported that Italy has increased its troops in the port of Zara on the Adriatic Sea. Furthermore, the theory that Italy is assisting Croat autonomists is also widely circulated here. (16th National Telegram)</p>

Along the way, thousands of farmers gathered to pay their respects and offer their last respects. Therefore, the late King's special train stopped briefly at each station. Representatives of the royal family, the regency, the government, the church, and the army greeted the train at the station. There were three large white crosses on the carriage carrying the coffin. The greeters were all silent. The late King's crown and sword were placed on the coffin. The cabinet members carried the coffin to the waiting room used by the royal family, and then senior military officers helped it onto the hearse. The crowd knelt and prayed. About 100 cars were used in the funeral procession, all moving slowly, straight to the old palace. After the coffin stays for two days, it will be moved to the Topola Church, which was left by Alexander's father. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Belgrade King Alexander's coffin arrived in the capital at midnight. Tens of thousands of people stood silently in the streets under the dim light, not dispersing late at night, waiting for the passage of the coffin. The Queen, her mother, and members of the regency all came to greet the coffin into the palace. The coffin was carried on a gun carriage. The Queen and her mother rode in the same car, traveling in front of the gun carriage. The gun carriage was pulled by military officers, moving slowly. The onlookers on the side of the street were as thick as a wall, silent and solemn, with a tragic image. After the gun carriage arrived at the old palace, the coffin was moved to the hall, and a short religious ceremony was held. Many priests recited scriptures in the hall at night, and four military officers stood beside the coffin, guarding it with swords. This morning, the people of the country will enter the palace to pay their respects around the coffin. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) President Lebrun, leading his entourage, set off for the capital of Yugoslavia tonight to attend the funeral of Alexander I. Minister of War General Petain also accompanied the President. Before departing, the President met with the new French military attaché to China, Lieutenant Colonel Sabattier, and the French High Commissioner to Syria, Marte (formerly the French Minister to China).

<p>(Paris) The French government decided that October 18, the day of the funeral of the late King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Belgrade, and October 20, the day of Poincaré's funeral in Lorraine, will be days of national mourning. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Belgrade Since the news that French President Lebrun will personally come to the capital of Yugoslavia to attend the funeral of the late King Alexander, public opinion has stated that this move by the French President is an effort to compensate for his failure to adequately protect the monarch of a friendly country, resulting in his assassination. However, Yugoslavian public sentiment is still angry because it is reported that Alexander originally planned to bring 40 secret guards to France, but the plan was abandoned after the French police authorities repeatedly guaranteed that protection would be thorough and that nothing unfortunate would happen. Now, the Yugoslavian side is strongly criticizing France, not only for the laxity of the police but also attacking everything else. Now that French President Lebrun is coming here with three cabinet members, he will probably try his best to repair relations to appease public anger in Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Czech and Romanian Foreign Ministers Pinić and Titulescu will also come here to assist the French President in completing his mission, as the Czech and Romanian countries do not want the Marseille massacre to damage the close relationship between the Little Entente and France. It is also satisfactory that the news has spread that Romanian King Carol will also come here to attend the funeral of the Yugoslavian King, but there is also much speculation about the future, as King Carol originally planned to go to France, but his trip to France will probably be canceled, and he will take this opportunity to negotiate with the French President and others in the capital of Yugoslavia.

<p>(Paris) After the arrest of the key suspect in the Marseille massacre, Marni, last night, the French police authorities obtained many more clues. The suspect confessed that his real name is Kraal and that he was born on October 11, 1908, in Kravaře, which now belongs to the Czech Republic. He lived as a mechanic in Budapest. It is true that he conspired with his accomplices to assassinate the King of Yugoslavia. After escaping four days ago, he hid in a cave in the forest. Later, driven by hunger, he entered a village, but his disheveled appearance and tattered clothes attracted attention, and he was arrested by the police. This person has no passport.

According to unverified rumors, the general headquarters of the party seems to have moved to the interior of Turkey, in the Adıyaman region, to hide. This relocation of the famous Macedonian revolutionary party coincided with the discovery of the terrorist group responsible for the Marseille bloodshed, which has attracted particular attention from all sides.

<p>(Paris) Today, the police arrested a person related to the Marseille assassination in Melun, 10 miles northwest of Fontainebleau. The person is named Marni (or Cherny) and is said to be a member of the terrorist group. He had previously escaped the dragnet. When he was arrested today, he was exhausted and offered no resistance. As a result of the confession of the accomplice of the prime suspect, Kalman, the authorities of the three countries now hope to arrest the mastermind of this bloodshed as soon as possible. The heads of detectives from Switzerland, France, and Yugoslavia are currently in Lausanne to discuss a cooperative plan for a large-scale arrest of the murderers. At the same time, the French authorities are still engaged in cleaning up restless foreigners within the country. Today, an order has been issued to expel an Austrian woman named Sem from the country because she had distributed Croat revolutionary documents. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

In 1914, he was elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. In 1920, he was transferred to the Senate. During the European War, he served in Clemenceau's "Tiger Premier" cabinet and is currently the Vice Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.

<h3 id="e24">Assessment of Poincaré after His Death: He Repaid His Lifelong Ambitions with the Price of War <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the semi-official newspaper of the German government, "Foreign Political Review", published an article, one sentence of which was: "After the death of French Foreign Minister Barthou, Poincaré passed away in succession, only a few days apart, and an era in French political history has come to an end." The newspaper added that Barthou and Poincaré were direct successors of the founders of the French Third Republic. Their entry into the political arena was at a time when the enthusiastic sentiment of fighting for republicanism was gradually declining. Therefore, the remarks made by Prime Minister Doumergue at Barthou's state funeral can be applied to Poincaré without any gaps. Poincaré's life was really settled by the events of 1870. His lifelong ambition was to restore the losses suffered by France in the Franco-Prussian War. He also worked for this opportunity. Therefore, Poincaré's life deeds also bore the cost of regaining national territory, "but the price he paid was also a major war that was unparalleled in world history." (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The former President Poincaré died of illness not a week after the late Foreign Minister Barthou was assassinated in Marseille. The collapse of national pillars in succession can truly be said to be unfortunate. Newspapers published obituaries, all printed with very wide black lines to express mourning. Everyone knew about the former President's illness, but no one expected him to pass away so quickly. Moreover, the change in Marseille, France lost a close friend (referring to King Alexander of Yugoslavia) and a loyal cabinet member, and the death of Poincaré occurred only a few days apart. Old wounds have not healed, and new pains have been added frequently. This is why the French people are deeply frowning and have infinite sadness. Various newspapers published lengthy articles commemorating the President, describing his spiritual advantages, his ability to govern, his loyalty to the Republic, and his strength of will. What was particularly emphasized were the difficulties that Poincaré encountered during the European War from 1914 to 1918 and his achievements in consolidating finances and restoring the credit of the franc in 1926. Former cabinet member Loulou published an article in the newspaper, saying, "The former President Poincaré had extraordinary brainpower, and his ability to govern was stronger than can be imagined by ordinary people. His memory was far superior to that of ordinary people, and he was truly a genius in the political world. In addition to this, Poincaré's knowledge and morality were even more admirable. His deeds are enough to be recorded in history and he is truly a great figure in France." Le Matin commented, "In the eventful history of France, is there anyone more admirable than Poincaré? A politician's loyalty to the country is selfless, and there is probably no second person other than Poincaré who can govern with wisdom." (16th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Manila) This morning, a hurricane struck with unprecedented force since 1905. Trees and utility poles were uprooted, disrupting public services. A tsunami accompanied the wind, grounding seven ships. Most of the city was flooded, and countless walls collapsed, causing further damage. The power plant was also damaged. The hurricane originated between Yap Island and Palau Island, 2,000 miles southwest of Manila, and swept along a semi-circular path towards Luzon. Upon reaching Manila, it moved towards the China Sea. Ships at sea received wireless warnings to seek refuge in ports. Harbor traffic here is completely disrupted. The Blue Funnel Line's "Ulysses" (14,626 tons) and the E-Tai Company's "Glenogle" (9,513 tons) were grounded by the wind. Several other ships were also grounded. As of noon today, the extent of the damage is still difficult to assess. Authorities are now engaged in relief efforts. Wireless communication between Manila and the United States was interrupted for several hours. The first telegram received in San Francisco regarding the Manila hurricane was sent by the local telegraph office. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Manila) The most severe hurricane in thirty years struck Manila this morning. Seven ships were blown ashore. Property damage in Manila alone is estimated to be at least several million dollars. The damage in the surrounding areas is even more severe. Twenty miles east of Manila, the wind was extremely strong, leaving a trail of devastation. At 4:00 AM this morning, the weather station issued a No. 7 typhoon warning. Shortly after, the storm arrived, flooding the entire city. Power and telephone lines were destroyed. The center of the storm was in Bulacan Province, 20 miles northeast of Manila, where at least 2,000 people were left homeless. Almost all provinces north of Manila suffered significant damage. There have been no reports of deaths in Manila proper so far, but it is currently impossible to estimate the number of deaths and the extent of the losses due to heavy rain, tsunamis, and river flooding. Traffic in several parts of the city remains disrupted. The Civil Governor's Office and surrounding residential areas are under a foot of water. All telegraph lines to the capital have been destroyed. The hurricane changed direction overnight, hitting Manila head-on from the east, making its arrival completely unexpected. Waves in the harbor were whipped up by the wind and flooded the city, causing water levels of three feet on the main streets. The hurricane came and went quickly, but the harbor traffic is in chaos and the losses are incalculable. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Hungarian Miners Achieve Wage Increase After Four Days of Underground Hunger Strike <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Budapest) In the small Hungarian town of Bánfalva, one thousand miners preferred to endure the pain of starvation rather than relinquish their demand for an 8% wage increase. Today marks the fourth day of their hunger strike. The miners are located a thousand feet underground and vow not to leave until their demands are met. Although a government representative has strongly urged the strike representatives to negotiate a solution with the mine owner, the Danube Navigation Company, there is no hope as of this evening. The scene at the mine entrance today is heartbreaking. The miners' wives gathered there, shouting and crying, begging to enter the mine and be with their husbands. Soldiers with machine guns and bayonets forcibly stopped them. Among the crowd of women were 1,200 Christian Socialist Party miners, who also demanded to enter the mine and die with their comrades. The situation in the mine is even more dire. Some are so hungry that they have tried to hang themselves to end their suffering, but their companions have tied their hands and feet to keep them alive. The miners have also shut down the air extraction machines, making the underground heat unbearable and the air polluted. It is reported that many are now lying in small pools of water and coal dust, with coal lumps as pillows. This afternoon, several miners were carried to the surface, all barely alive. Those sent down to persuade the strikers to come to the surface for negotiations were arrested by the strikers. A telephone message was sent to the mine entrance, saying, "Please prepare 950 coffins. We are determined to die. We would rather die here of hunger and gas than wither away on the surface due to insufficient wages." The situation is now very critical, as the miners cannot last much longer underground. The strikers' actions have prevented 3,500 miners from working.</p>
<p>Continuation: The coal miners' strike was resolved late tonight. It is reported that the terms include a wage increase and no punishment. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Budapest) The government mediated the coal miners' strike, agreeing to purchase 250 train cars of coal, provided that the mine owner complies with the miners' demands regarding wages and working conditions. With the mine owner's agreement, the miners finally ended their hunger strike. As the thousand men staggered out of the mine entrance, their families embraced them joyfully, a scene that moved onlookers to tears. The miners clearly suffered greatly, but according to the mine owner, no workers have been reported ill. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Whether the preparatory talks for the 1935 Naval Conference can begin before next week remains uncertain. These preparatory talks should begin with the Japanese delegation. Britain and America are awaiting the proposals of the Japanese representatives. Before the Japanese proposals are submitted, the preparatory work of the British and American delegations is futile. Most of this week will be spent by Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto and Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira to coordinate everything. Before the Japanese delegation is ready, Anglo-Japanese negotiations will not begin, let alone anything else. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The United States and Japan have sent representatives to London for preliminary negotiations for the naval conference. Japan's representative is Rear Admiral Yamamoto, who recently passed through the United States. The United States' representatives are Norman Davis, who has participated in disarmament conferences in the past, and Chief of Naval Operations Stanley, who also departed eastward a few days ago. British officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude before the representatives of both countries arrive. Japan's Rear Admiral Yamamoto will arrive in London tomorrow morning. Upon arrival, he will contact the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, to convey the instructions of the Japanese government. The American representative, Davis, will disembark at Plymouth Harbor tomorrow night and will confer with the American Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, to discuss the attitude that the American representative should adopt. After the representatives of the two countries each contact their respective ambassadors, preliminary naval negotiations can begin. However, the bilateral nature of the talks will be strictly maintained. In other words, there will be separate talks between Britain and Japan, the United States and Japan, and Britain and the United States, rather than a joint consultation between the representatives of the three countries. Because the official naval conference is scheduled for next year, holding a joint meeting of representatives from the three countries during the preliminary talks would give the impression that the naval conference is being held prematurely. Separate talks can avoid this problem. The scope of the Japanese proposal is currently unknown. Before the Japanese proposal is announced, the British side will temporarily be represented by First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell, and will not express a specific direction for the talks, but will wait for Japan to put forward its suggestions before determining the British viewpoint. According to the official declarations made by Tokyo regarding Japan's naval policy, which have sometimes seemed contradictory, Japan's desire to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty cannot be denied. The abolition of the naval treaty has two implications: (1) the issue of naval bases in the Far East will be raised again; (2) political issues will be mixed into naval technology and strategy. In this way, countries with political demands will gain entry into the 1935 Naval Conference. It is generally believed that if the naval conference develops to this point, Britain will not oppose the participation of secondary naval powers in the naval conference, and political issues will inevitably be raised. As for the issue of naval ratios, Britain does not see how it can accept Japan's request to revise the original 5:5:3 ratio of the Washington Naval Treaty. Britain believes that the ratio system was adopted primarily to ensure national security, not just for national prestige. Moreover, countries have different types and sizes of overseas territories, and the government's responsibility for protection and the extent to which it needs the navy also vary. The ratio system is determined in light of these circumstances. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Tang Shaoyi, the model county magistrate of Zhongshan and standing committee member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, has recently become unpopular with a segment of the population. The movement to overthrow Tang has been brewing for a long time. Several months ago, representatives of the citizens of Zhongshan County enumerated Tang's ten major crimes and came to the province to accuse Tang to the military and political authorities. Later, Tang was able to get the case against him temporarily suspended through the influence of some people. However, those who opposed Tang did not give up. Soon after, there was an assassination attempt on Tang at his home. Fortunately, Tang's guards repelled several assassins, although two guards were killed. Tang was unharmed. Recently, Lin Shuwei, the chief of the Zhongshan County Public Security Bureau, resigned voluntarily. In order to suppress the situation, Tang urgently appointed his trusted confidant Lin Jinghun as the chief of the Public Security Bureau and a Mr. Xiao as the head of the county soldiers. However, the organization and strength of the Zhongshan County police force are concentrated in the Public Security Bureau, which controls all county soldiers, police, and security teams, possessing approximately 10,000 firearms. The county soldiers are organized into three battalions, each with three companies, each company divided into three platoons. Each battalion has a strength of 1,000 soldiers. With Lin Shuwei's resignation as chief of the Public Security Bureau, the position became fiercely contested by both sides. The order appointing Lin Jinghun to replace him further incited Tang's opponents. Therefore, soon after Lin Jinghun received Tang's order but before he took office, the county soldiers, using the pretext of unpaid wages, started a dispute, swarming to Tang Shaoyi's residence in Tangjiawan, binding up Lin Jinghun, and threatening Tang with weapons, forcing him to hand over county administration. Tang, nearing seventy years old,</p>
<p>was so frightened that his face turned pale and his mind became deranged. The mutinous soldiers then escorted Lin Jinghun back to Shiqi, plunging the entire county into a state of anarchy. This occurred on the 5th of this month. The county party headquarters and county council jointly selected four representatives on the 6th to petition the province to maintain order in the county. The highest military authorities immediately dispatched Liang Gongfu's battalion from Luo Cequn's regiment of the First Training Division to Zhongshan to maintain county security. After arriving in the province, the Zhongshan citizen representatives also consulted with the headquarters, provincial government, and the Southwest Political Affairs Rehabilitation Committee to inquire about solutions. The various agencies did not give specific answers for the time being. Currently, the newly appointed chief of the Public Security Bureau, Lin Jinghun, is being held captive, and Tang Shaoyi is bedridden. The position of county magistrate is therefore vacant. The military authorities plan to temporarily appoint Luo Cequn, the regimental commander of the Training Division sent to Zhongshan to maintain security, to act as county magistrate, and Liang Gongfu, the battalion commander, as the acting chief of the Public Security Bureau. The impact of this incident on Tang's elderly and frail body is particularly detrimental. Hu Hanmin, residing in Hong Kong, heard the news and wired Chen Jitang yesterday, instructing him to protect Tang, stating: "I heard that a major dispute has broken out in Zhongshan. The specific situation is not very clear here, but since Shao Lao (Tang Shaochuan) is in a dangerous position, the provincial troops should be ordered to disband the rebellious county soldiers and ensure Shao Lao's safety in the province as the first priority. This is our responsibility, both publicly and privately." (9th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">The National Army Recovers Xingguo City <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Casualties for the Pseudo 15th Army Corps</p>
<p>National Army Pursues Remnants Towards Ningdu</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xingguo is located in the western part of southern Jiangxi Province. To the east, it is parallel to Ningdu and Shicheng, to the west, it depends on Taihe and Wan'an, to the north, it connects to important bandit lairs such as Donggu, Futian, Longgang, Wangpi, and Xiaopu in Yongfeng, Jishui, Ji'an, and Ningdu, and to the south, it serves as a barrier for the bandit areas of Yudu and Ganzhou. It is a stronghold for bandits on both the east and west banks of the Gan River. Previously, when the Northern Route Army recovered Guangchang, Xingguo, Shicheng, and Ningdu were aligned. From a military standpoint, they should be listed as simultaneous targets. Furthermore, because the bandits in southeastern Jiangxi were heavily surrounded by the National Army, there was a trend for them to break out of the encirclement from Xingtai and Wan'an across the Gan River and flee westward to Hunan and Guizhou. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specifically ordered Zhou Hunyuan to lead troops to station in Taihe to capture Xingguo and to strengthen the defense forces in the middle section of the Gan River to block the bandits' westward escape route. This involved dozens of battles, large and small, the most notable of which were the battles of Shacun, Lantian, and Laopan. These locations were all dangerous mountainous areas where the bandits had already built strong fortifications with stone bunkers, earthen pits, trenches, and barricades that were very well-built. They were all broken through by the joint efforts of the National Army's infantry, artillery, and air forces. Another example is the battle of Gaoxingxu. This area is the heart of Xingguo and is related to the bandits' survival. In the bandit suppression campaign of the 20th year of the Republic, tens of thousands of bandits were killed in this battle, making it a famous battlefield in the history of bandit suppression, even more so than Jinggang, Jinjiazhai, and Qiliping. The Red bandits learned their lesson and deployed the pseudo 1st Army Corps, 1st, 2nd divisions, the pseudo 5th Army Corps, the 13th Independent 6th Division, and local pseudo-independent regiments in the highlands around Shixingshan, Zhugaoshan, and Shacunnao, attempting to fight the National Army. Starting on the 30th of last month, the National Army first launched a fierce bombing campaign with artillery and aircraft, followed by an infantry assault, destroying more than 30 bandit fortresses and killing thousands of bandits. On the 7th of this month, the National Army finally occupied Gaoxingxu. The bandits retreated to the county seat. After being relentlessly pursued by the National Army, they launched a siege on the 11th. At that time, the bandits in the city had completely lost their morale and were unable to fight any longer. They forced the people to destroy their stoves and break their pots, packing food and fleeing into the mountains. Taking advantage of the bandits' panic, the National Army launched a fierce attack and entered the county seat around 1 PM on the 15th. According to a phone call from the front, the pseudo 1st and 5th Army Corps suffered extremely heavy casualties and retreated toward Ningdu via the Longgangtou (northern Xingguo) area. They are still being pursued. Xingguo was captured by the bandits six or seven years ago. It was recovered once in the 20th year of the Republic, but was then reoccupied by the bandits. Hao Mengling's troops all made heroic sacrifices there, because the mountainous terrain made it difficult to recover. Now, the National Army has recovered it by proceeding step by step and building roads and bunkers. Wherever the army goes, order is stable. Xie Shouru, the magistrate of Xingguo County, who was handling post-war affairs in Lantian, has already entered the city with the army. The National Army is now clearing the battlefield, burying bandit corpses, repairing the city walls, constructing fortifications on the high ground attached to the city, and recruiting refugees. The main force is pursuing the bandits in order to wipe them out completely. (October 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Robbery on the Zhangsong Road in Fujian Province <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Impersonate Soldiers, Intercept Vehicles Halfway to Commit Robbery</p>
<p>After the Robbery, Five Passengers Were Kidnapped, Their Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: On Double Tenth Day (October 10th), a passenger car on the Zhangsong Highway, a major transportation artery between Xiamen and Zhangzhou, was intercepted by bandits dressed as soldiers, and five passengers were kidnapped. The Zhangsong Road is 100 li long. Every day, steamships from the Xiamen station and express trains from the Zhangzhou station run ten round trips each. A slow train stops at small stations along the way every hour. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, the third express train from Zhangzhou to Xiamen, numbered Min Zi 1281, driver Hu Jianzhong, was traveling when four people suddenly blocked the road with Browning pistols as the car reached Donghu Township, 25 li from Zhangzhou. The driver tried to accelerate past, but the men opened fire, the bullets grazing the side of the car. The driver thought they were regular soldiers and had no way to avoid them, so he stopped the car. Only then did the driver and passengers realize they had encountered bandits, but they were helpless. The bandits forced the driver to continue driving towards Songyu. Two more bandits boarded the car after passing Zhentou, and two more boarded after passing Jiangdong Bridge, all dressed as soldiers. Upon reaching Cai Dian, the bandits ordered the car to stop and searched the passengers' belongings. All 25 passengers in the car were searched. After the search, they left five passengers on the car and drove the rest off, forcing the driver and the five passengers to huddle under the seats in the car, not allowing them to move. One bandit drove the car, four bandits held Browning pistols, standing on the left and right sides, while the two bandits holding onto the car were on guard, and the remaining three bandits held guns in the car, monitoring the five passengers and the driver, strictly forbidding them from making any noise. The bandits spoke in a Nanyang "Malay" dialect and spoke to each other in Cantonese or English. After driving the car themselves, the bandits immediately accelerated and sped to Jiaowei. Jiaowei Station is one of the stations on the Zhangsong Line, 30 li from Songyu, and is also the starting station for the Jiaotong Line (Jiaowei to Tong'an). Troops are stationed there. The bandit car drove to the station without stopping and turned east towards the Jiaotong Line. The sentries at the station wanted to come forward to inquire, but the bandit car had already turned and sped away. The sentries and staff at the Jiaowei Station of the Zhangsong Line thought it was a passenger car requisitioned by the military. However, the platoon leader stationed at Jiaodong found it strange that the car did not stop for inspection and immediately inquired at Jiaowei Station and contacted Zhangzhou Station by telephone, only to learn that it had been robbed by bandits. After being informed, the Zhangsong Management Department immediately sent people to Jiaowei and consulted with the fourth company of the Tong'an Ninth District Security Corps stationed in Dongpu Township. The military and security corps jointly dispatched a team to pursue them. At that time, the driver Hu Jianzhong had escaped and returned, driving the original car back to Jiaowei. He then used the original car to carry the fourth company of the Security Corps to pursue them, but the bandits had already fled far away. According to Hu Jianzhong, after the bandits drove the car past the Jiaowei sentry line, they sped along the Jiaotong Line towards Guankou. They stopped at the Guanyin Temple in Guankou, about 27-28 li from Jiaowei. First, they tied him to telephone pole number 709 on the side of the road with a hemp rope, then drove the five kidnapped passengers over the Yangkeng and Shenkeng Mountains. After the bandits left, a passing cowherd untied him, and he drove the original car back, according to the report. When the fourth company of the Security Corps arrived at the scene by car, nearby villagers said that the bandits had fled into the mountains long ago, seemingly heading towards Changtai or Lotus Mountain. The corps members immediately returned to Zhangzhou to report. After the Zhangzhou City Defense Command received the report from the garrison in Jiaowei, it ordered the temporary detention of the car driver Hu Jianzhong for questioning on the 11th. It also dispatched a team to patrol the Zhangsong Line from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM and ordered another team to search Tong'an. As of the evening of the 11th, nothing had been found. Only one of the five kidnapped passengers is known to be named Lu Lian, an employee of the Zhangzhou MSG factory. The names of the other four passengers have not yet been verified. The bandits speak Malay, Cantonese, and English, and seem to be returning overseas Chinese or Cantonese bandits. (12th)</p>

<p>The Peng family of Peng Fusheng in Xinzhuang is of ordinary means, barely making ends meet. This year's drought resulted in a poor harvest. Recently, the cotton matured, and they harvested twelve bales of cotton, intending to sell them to clear their old debts. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 13th, thieves stole all twelve bales of cotton. The owner was terrified. It was later learned that the culprits were Zhang Aliang and Lu Yongquan. Zhang Yongquan is related to Peng Fusheng through marriage. The stolen cotton was jointly owned by Peng Fusheng and his sister-in-law, a certain Ms. Peng. Upon hearing about the theft, Peng Fusheng's sister-in-law was inconsolable. She lamented her fate and hanged herself in secret. The owner has reported the matter to the Sixth Sub-Station, which has arrested Zhang Aliang and Zhang Yongquan and handed them over to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. However, the suicide of Peng Fusheng's sister-in-law due to the theft is a separate matter. It is unknown how this theft case will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Yizhong Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office, considering that there are over a thousand households distilling liquor in the New Third District, and the collected license fees over the years have been less than a quarter of the total, in order to rectify tax revenue and maintain the contracted amount, hired a boat and sent personnel to the district at the beginning of this month to investigate each liquor household, handle registration, and prepare to initiate the autumn license tax collection. Initially, the work was going smoothly, but unexpectedly, the night before, when the boat was docked in the river near Huadafang Village, more than a hundred villagers of unknown name suddenly came in the darkness, wielding bricks and stones, and violently attacked the boat, causing the boat windows to be shattered. The officials in the boat wrapped their heads in cotton blankets, preventing skin lacerations and bloodshed.

<p>This year's severe drought has caused a disaster, and the autumn harvest has been reduced. Each district has reported the yield to the county separately, especially the fifth and sixth districts, where the cotton fields are severely barren. However, in order to conduct an on-site inspection of the actual situation, the provincial departments have sent Shu Sheyu, Zhang Buzhou, and others to Changshu for inspection. It is now known that in the western Fourth District, due to the higher terrain, there was no way to draw water during the prolonged drought, so as much as five-tenths of the rice paddies were not planted. As a result, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. On the 15th, representatives Tang Guanghan, Miao Zuolin, Qian Yuanlong, and eight or nine others were dispatched to the county at 1 p.m. to visit the county magistrate and petition. They were immediately received, and the representatives made two requests: (1) Request the provincial inspection committee to visit the villages for inspection immediately; (2) Request the county magistrate to find a way to allocate funds immediately to handle urgent relief, because many farmers who did not plant rice have no harvest and are now sitting and waiting to die, otherwise they may take desperate risks. County Magistrate Zhai immediately stated that regarding the former, since the provincial committee has already come to Changshu, they can go to the villages for inspection immediately. Regarding the latter, he will do his best to provide relief, but a meeting must be held to discuss and find a solution in terms of economics.</p>

Unexpectedly, at about 12 o'clock at night, four thieves suddenly came and kidnapped him. After being kidnapped to Xintang, about two li away from Duntou, the thieves had prepared a boat in advance, so they went down to the boat and landed on the Zhushan Bamboo Bay, climbed over mountains and ridges. Because Huang's feet were injured, he could no longer walk, so they rested temporarily in the pine forest on Shangze Mountain. Later, near Zhongze, they saw a small wheel coming, and the thieves suspected it was a pursuit force, so they released Huang and fled. Soon, a woodcutter passed by the area, and Huang told him the details of his ordeal. The woodcutter hired a boat to send him back, so he was able to escape danger. It can be said that he was lucky.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Desiring Peace <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In addition to answering the reporters' questions in writing, Mr. He also personally came out to talk with the reporters. It is said that the military situation for bandit suppression in Jiangxi is quite good. At this time of national crisis, it is hoped that the people of the country will unite as one and strive to become stronger. My long-cherished wish is to desire peace. When I went to Chahar and Suiyuan for inspection, I saw that many new houses had been built in the rural areas, and there had been significant progress in various constructions. The reason for this is that the area has not experienced war for more than a year, so the people can live and work in peace and engage in construction. This proves that only peace can promote construction. Our country is a member of the international community. If we want world peace, we must first seek domestic peace. Therefore, I, He Yingqin, sincerely hope that domestic peace will be realized as soon as possible, and then promote world peace, so that the mutual killing of mankind in the world can be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Silver Exports Gradually Cease After Imposition of Silver Export Tax <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Gold Standard Price Soars by More Than Forty Yuan</p>
<p>More Than Twenty Million Silver Exported Last Week</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, in order to prevent the continuous outflow of silver, our country has gradually reduced silver exports since the implementation of the silver export tax. The International Trade Bureau specially announced the total export volume last week yesterday. The details obtained yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Customs Notice of Tax Collection <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and tax officer Boerder, jointly issued Notice No. 1389 yesterday morning, which stated: "Ordered by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the silver export tax rates are now formulated as follows: (1) Silver standard currency shall be subject to an export tax of 10%, minus the minting fee of 2.25%, resulting in a net tax of 7.75%; (2) Other types of silver shall be subject to an export tax of 10%. If the exchange rate of the London silver price converted to Shanghai exchange rate differs from the exchange rate determined by the Central Bank on the same day, the amount of the difference shall be paid in addition to the above-mentioned export tax. If there is still a shortfall, a balancing tax shall be levied according to the amount of the shortfall, which shall be implemented uniformly from the 15th of this month. All parties shall comply accordingly." It should be complied with accordingly. All batches of silver exported from the 15th of this month, regardless of the date of shipment, shall be taxed according to the new tax rate. All exporting merchants are hereby notified. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Exports Gradually Eliminated <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New News Agency learned that foreign merchant ships preparing to ship silver for export, such as the Grand President of the Dollar Steamship Company, the Comorin of the British Company, and the Ikoma Maru of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, contained a total of 9.25 million silver dollars. Among them, 1 million was taxed according to regulations and shipped to the United States. The silver owners and exporters felt that if they paid taxes according to the new tax rate, not only would there be no profit to be made, but they would also have to lose money, so they declared withdrawal from customs and suspended transportation. Therefore, no cash was shipped out yesterday. Since speculators generally have no profit to gain, they have all stopped their activities. It is predicted that silver exports can be gradually eliminated. The Customs specifically ordered the customs officers yesterday to conduct strict investigations to prevent smuggling.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Gold Standard Rises Sharply <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the silver export tax, the gold standard market has continued to rise for days. However, the rise was even more severe yesterday. At 4:30 p.m., the closing price soared to more than 952.3 yuan, which is a phenomenon that has not been seen in recent times. The prices of yesterday are recorded below. The opening price in the morning was 914.3 yuan, the highest was 945 yuan, the lowest was 913.5 yuan, and the closing price was 944.8 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 952.5 yuan, the highest was 953 yuan, the lowest was 946 yuan, and the closing price was 952.3 yuan, an increase of more than 40 yuan compared to last week.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Investigation of Exports Last Week <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>

The destinations and quantities are as follows: (1) Silver bars were shipped to Singapore for 6,900 yuan, London for 1,992,000 yuan, and San Francisco for 230,000 yuan; (2) Silver ingots were shipped to Kobe for 845,065.55 yuan, London for 600,751.33 yuan; (3) Silver dollars were shipped to London for 15,100,000 yuan, San Francisco for 770,000 yuan, Seattle for 500,000 yuan, Moji for 650,000 yuan, Hong Kong for 544,500 yuan, and Hong Kong foreign currency for 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Using Jiangsu Provincial Bonds of 15 Million Yuan as Collateral</p>
<p>Various Banks and Qian Zhuang Will Organize a Syndicate to Handle the Loan</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the 20 million yuan of Jiangsu Water Conservancy Construction Public Bonds in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) were issued on October 1, they have already been printed. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department, hosted a banquet for the leaders of Shanghai banks and qian zhuang the night before. Chen Zeqing, Ye Fuxiao, Lin Kanghou, and others from the banking industry, and Qin Runqing, Chairman of the Qian Industry Association, as the chief representative, attended. First, Director Zhao reported on the issuance of the Jiangsu Water Conservancy Construction Public Bonds, the use of the public bonds, and decided to organize a fund custody committee and invite the banking and qian industries to be members.</p>

<p>During the banquet, Director Zhao contacted various banks such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Continental Bank, Yanyeh Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Zhejiang Shiye Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Farmers Bank, and Agricultural and Commercial Bank, as well as various qian zhuang, and proposed to mortgage 8 million yuan with Jiangsu provincial bonds with a face value of 15 million yuan. Because the use of Jiangsu provincial bonds is for water conservancy construction, the banks and qian zhuang generally agreed in principle. Because it was a preliminary contact at the time, no specific decisions were made, and interest and term were not discussed. The banquet ended late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Deciding to Form a Syndicate <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

After each bank and qian zhuang determine the amount of the loan, they will hold a meeting to formally negotiate and decide. The various banks and qian zhuang have decided to form a syndicate to handle the loan in the future. The mortgage loan contract and all conditions will be negotiated and signed by the syndicate on behalf of the banks and qian zhuang with the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<h3 id="e118">City Federation and Stamp Tax Documents <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Old Stamps Can Be Registered for Exchange</p>
<p>New Laws Are Trivial, Please Maintain Old Practices</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of the First Special District of this city previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request that old stamps be exchanged for new tax stamps, and a reply has been received yesterday. In addition, the federation sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan on the draft stamp tax law proposed by the Legislative Yuan, which increases the tax rate and has trivial categories. The two articles are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Approval from the Ministry of Finance The Ministry of Finance approved, Tax No. 2963, one telegram, requesting permission to exchange old stamps for new stamps in order to relieve commercial difficulties. The telegram has been received. The matter of limiting the use of old stamps to before the end of October has been repeatedly requested by chambers of commerce in various places to withdraw the order. In order to specially consider the commercial difficulties, the Ministry is planning to formulate registration measures and selectively exchange new stamps in installments, and has replied to the National Federation of Commerce by telegram. You are hereby informed. This approval,</p>
<p>Telegram to the Legislative Yuan To President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Nanjing. It has been read in the newspapers that the tax rates in the draft stamp tax law proposed by your esteemed Yuan are several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times higher than the tax rates in the current provisional regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. I am shocked to hear this. At this time of commercial depression and lack of business, maintaining the original tax rules is already very difficult. Once heavier taxes are added, the common people will be unable to bear the burden. Moreover, the items that should be stamped are divided into categories and are trivial and abnormal. Without daily research, people often inadvertently violate the law. In addition, the tax rates are inappropriate, which increases the concerns of the common people. The matter concerns the vital interests of the business community, and I must request your esteemed Yuan to quickly maintain the old stamp tax rates, and to approve and implement them. The merchants will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation respectfully presents its greetings.</p>
<h3 id="e119">First Batch of American Loan Flour Arrives <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>344,000 Bags</p>
<p>Divided and Loaded onto Tricycles to Shanghai</p>
<p>Our country ordered American wheat with loans, which includes a flour item, totaling 250,000 tons, or about 10 million bags. Previously, due to unfavorable market prices, it had not been shipped. Now, the Cotton and Wheat Administration has been selling it successively, so it has been loaded in the United States and shipped to Shanghai. The first batch of flour was transported by the American ship Yaligan, carrying 144,000 bags, totaling 3,600 tons, and can be imported today and temporarily unloaded at the warehouse. Another 200,000 bags of American flour sold to Tianjin will be loaded on the Huiskangxin and Guteshi ships, which are expected to be imported on the 20th of this month and transferred to Tianjin after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Municipal Government's Order to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Raise Funds for Dredging Wusong River <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Will Soon Convene Various Industries for Discussion</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to dredge the Wusong River in sections, the Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly convened representatives from the Public Utilities Bureau, Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Navigation Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., to discuss the matter in detail. It was resolved to tentatively estimate the dredging expenses at 200,000 yuan, with the Municipal Government bearing 50,000 yuan, and the remaining 150,000 yuan to be raised by the Chamber of Commerce from various industries. It is now learned that the Municipal Government yesterday issued an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing it to convene various industries to discuss the implementation plan for this project. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also replied that it will schedule a meeting soon. The Municipal Government's order is recorded as follows: "Regarding the dredging of the Wusong River, this government has repeatedly convened the Chamber of Commerce and the Navigation Association to discuss and plan its implementation. However, due to insufficient funds, it has not been possible to start construction immediately. The Wusong River is of great importance to the transportation of various industries in this city. Every winter, due to drought and shallow water, the river channel becomes silted up, and transportation is suspended, causing great suffering. The past is not far away, and it is sufficient to serve as a warning. Now, as we are about to work together with Jiangsu Province to implement dredging in sections, the matter concerns the vital interests of all industries in this city. All industries in our city should make concerted efforts to support and participate in this important project. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce is hereby ordered to immediately convene fellow businesses from the water transport industry, coal industry, timber industry, flour industry, yarn industry, miscellaneous grains industry, and the inland river shipping industry, etc., to earnestly discuss the project and collectively plan the financial aspects, with the Chamber of Commerce being responsible for collecting and forwarding the funds, in order to benefit this important project and resolve the outstanding issue as soon as possible. The Chamber of Commerce is ordered to promptly and earnestly comply with this order without delay. This is of utmost importance. The situation of compliance should be reported at any time. This order is imperative."</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's newly built Haiyuan Steamer, which departed from England on September 14th, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. The company had prepared all the reception and welcome tour procedures. However, due to the empty load and long voyage along the ocean to China, the steamer reduced its speed and dared not travel quickly. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's radio station has instructed various South China steamers to issue calls, but has not yet reached it, probably due to the distance. According to the company's news yesterday, the Haiyuan Steamer's arrival in Shanghai may be delayed until the 4th of next month. The exact news will only be available after it arrives in Hong Kong, from where a direct telegram can be sent to Shanghai.

<p>Prohibiting Labor Unions from Forcing Workers to Join</p>
<p>Admonishing Businesses Not to Be Hostile Towards Labor Unions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued Proclamation No. 9991 yesterday, stating that Article 20 of the Labor Union Law stipulates, "Labor unions shall not force workers to join or prevent them from withdrawing. Labor unions shall not refuse membership to those who are qualified under the law and articles of association, nor shall they allow membership to those who are unqualified. Labor unions shall not obstruct the work of non-union members." Article 31 of the same law stipulates, "Employers or their agents shall not refuse to employ or dismiss workers, or subject them to other unfavorable treatment, because they are members or officers of a labor union." Furthermore, Article 32 stipulates, "Employers or their agents shall not make non-participation in union duties, non-membership in a labor union, or withdrawal from a labor union a condition of employment." The above-mentioned articles of law have been repeatedly announced by this bureau. However, due to the passage of time, both labor and management still frequently cause disputes due to this, which is quite inappropriate. It must be understood that if the organization of a labor union can seek legitimate benefits for workers and make workers firm in their beliefs, why worry that they will not enthusiastically join? If they are hostile towards those who do not join, or even force them to join and hinder their work, this kind of immature behavior is the opposite of the purpose of organizing a union. Why should workers value such a labor union? On the employment side, it should be understood that labor unions are groups whose purpose is to increase workers' knowledge and skills, develop production, and maintain and improve labor conditions and living standards. If they are necessarily regarded as enemies of the capital side, or if the lack of organization and weak knowledge of the workers is used to take whatever one wants, and labor unions are regarded as superfluous, then suspicion will arise and the friendship of mutual assistance will be lost. Therefore, this proclamation is issued again earnestly, urging all labor unions, factories, and shops in this city to abide by it together and understand this purpose. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the law, this bureau will have to enforce the law and will never be lenient. This proclamation is imperative.</p>

<p>(Yongxing Lane) Yongxing Lane, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road, is the property of Chen Bingqian, a wealthy Cantonese merchant, and is managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm. Chen is a philanthropist, so the original rent was quite low. During the Shanghai war, the rent was reduced by 7%. Now, the tenants there, seeing that the market is in a slump and business is not improving, recently jointly submitted a letter requesting a further reduction. Yesterday, the tenants of the lane received a reply from Xiangmao Foreign Firm, agreeing to reduce the rent. From November onwards, it will be collected at 85% of the original price. Most tenants are satisfied, which can be considered good news in the rent reduction movement.</p>
<p>(Renshun Lane) Renshun Lane Branch of the 26th District of the Municipal Federation, located on North Jiangxi Road, has been negotiating with Wuhe Foreign Firm since its establishment to promote rent reduction. The firm is acting as an agent. The landlord, seeing the market depression, agreed to a 10% rent reduction for the sake of maintaining the difficult situation. The negotiation has been concluded, with the same treatment for both storefronts and residential houses. Renshun Lane is said to be the first to reduce rent through Wuhe.</p>

<p>More Than 300 Still in Tokyo Will Be Expelled</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Sent Personnel to Investigate the Truth of the Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The eighth batch of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, including Xu Chunlang and others, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th. The ninth batch of overseas Chinese also arrived in Shanghai at 6 pm yesterday, on the Japanese steamer Tsukuba Maru from Tokyo. The steamer was docked at Huishan Wharf, where representatives of overseas Chinese in Shanghai went to the wharf to welcome them and led them to the Laogongxin Inn on the Bund for lodging. Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Ye Qifa, Jin Baocai, Xiang Gongxiang, Xiang Yinchai, etc. According to the overseas Chinese speaking to the Riri News reporter, they were escorted onto the Japanese steamer Tsukuba Maru by Japanese police on the 10th of this month and expelled back to their motherland. The steamer was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 14th, but was delayed until today due to a hurricane en route. It is now said that there are still more than 300 overseas Chinese in Tokyo, and the Japanese government is preparing to expel them all back to China. When the Japanese steamer Aso Maru arrives in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, a large number will arrive here. In addition, it is learned that Tan Zhonglu, the Shanghai-based officer of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, went to the overseas Chinese's residence at 3 pm yesterday to investigate the truth of their expulsion and the various situations of their businesses and confiscated properties in Japan in great detail in order to report to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and provide relief, and to forward the information to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the basis for future negotiations.</p>

<p>To Be Repaid as Soon as Local Public Bonds Are Issued</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has suffered a severe drought this year. Various circles in Hangzhou previously organized the Zhejiang Relief Association to raise funds for disaster relief. The General Assembly resolved to request the Provincial Government to allocate 600,000 yuan first to handle urgent relief. However, the Finance Department was unable to allocate funds quickly due to a shortage of tax revenue and a lack of funds in the provincial treasury. Wang Zhengying, Director of the Finance Department, wrote a letter to various committee members of the Shanghai Relief Association in his private capacity, requesting them to raise loans on his behalf, to be repaid as soon as local public bonds are issued, in order to relieve the urgent needs of millions of disaster victims who are crying out for food.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments yesterday for the sake of ensuring the safety of workers, stating that not long ago, an explosion occurred at the Shanghai Taiyi Malt Flour Factory, killing and injuring many employees. The cause of the explosion was that the factory was located in an ordinary alley house, and many barrels of alcohol were placed in an unsafe location. Before the explosion, alcohol gas had been leaking for as long as half an hour without being noticed. This shows that the factory usually had no disaster prevention training for workers, which violated the provisions of the Factory Law. There are many factories in various places, and safety equipment is very important. The disaster at the Taiyi Factory should be taken as a warning to pay attention to improvement and avoid repeating the same mistake. The competent authorities must earnestly promote factory inspections, and factories whose equipment is not perfected should be enforced according to law to ensure safety.</p>

<h3 id="e131">An Appeal from the Ramie Cloth Industry Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Submitting to Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Negotiate with Japan to Cancel Heavy Taxes</p>
<p>Xin Shouheng, Liu Wenliang, Xu Chengqing and other standing committee members of the Jiangxi Ramie Cloth Industry Association in Shanghai submitted a document to Premier Wang, stating that it was submitted for heavy taxes and harsh laws, which are beneficial but not mutual. It is hoped that the matter will be negotiated reasonably to maintain national credibility and sympathize with the difficulties of merchants. China's ramie cloth has been sold in Korea for many years. In the past, Jiangxi Province alone exported about 4 million pieces. After 1927, Japan repeatedly increased tax rates, causing commercial people to suffer losses and slump. According to recent statistics, exports, including Sichuan Province, are only 1 million yuan. The impact is very clear. Now, for coarse ramie cloth, which used to be taxed at 18 yuan or 21 yuan per 100 jin, it has now increased to 32.4 yuan to 45.9 yuan. For fine cloth, which used to be taxed at 32 yuan or 40 yuan, it has now increased to 70.2 yuan to 97.2 yuan. It is estimated that the value is almost equal to 100% of the value. Coarse and fine cloths are also divided into four types: coarse, slightly coarse, top fine, and slightly fine. The taxes are heavy and the laws are harsh. In 1933, the reciprocal agreement signed between China and Japan expired. The association believes that the annual excess of Japanese goods imported is no less than tens of millions. If import taxes on Japanese goods can be slightly increased from then on, it will be for the overall benefit of the country. Even if the ramie cloth item is sacrificed, it will be enough to compensate for the loss. Therefore, even though it is under heavy tax pressure, it has been silently endured without wanting to disturb you. Now, China's newly revised import tariff has been promulgated on July 1. According to a report on July 14, Finance Minister Kong said that although the government has reduced part of the tax rate on Japanese imports, it was originally for the sake of seeking reciprocity. For example, ramie cloth is subject to high taxes, and this is the only way to demand a reduction. Our government pays attention to ramie cloth and has comprehensive plans, not hesitating to sacrifice significant income in order to exchange for reciprocity. The great intention of benefiting industry and commerce and promoting national goods is not only appreciated by hundreds of thousands of industrial and commercial people in the ramie cloth industry, but also celebrated by all citizens. However, since July, Japanese imports have enjoyed the benefits of tax cuts, while China's exports of ramie cloth are still subject to high taxes. Although it is said to be a negotiation, it still takes time. However, it has been several months since then, and there has been no indication from the Japanese government. The association believes that the Japanese are cunning and disregard national credibility. After hesitation, it is difficult to remain silent, so it is submitted to ask you to negotiate strictly, urging them to immediately cancel the heavy taxes on ramie cloth and issue new tax reduction rules so that the country's credibility is consistent with reciprocity in name and reality. As for how much to reduce, the association believes that it can restore the tax rate before 1927 or tax it at the same rate as cotton cloth imports, so that the nearly extinct export of ramie cloth can be hoped to turn around, and the annual import loss can be slightly compensated. Is it appropriate? I beg you to examine and approve, and I am extremely anxious to await orders. Sincerely submit to Wang, President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Government of the Dutch East Indies Restricts the Import of Japanese Ceramic Products <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Because Japanese Merchants Have the Ambition to Monopolize the Market</p>
<p>Therefore, the Regulations on the Import of Ceramics Are Now Promulgated</p>
<p>Chinese Ceramic Merchants Should Take the Opportunity to Work Hard to Promote Sales</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau's Guidance Office, in April of this year, Japanese ceramic importers in Java established the Java Ceramic Importers Association in Surabaya to control the import trade of ceramics in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies government believes that this move by Japanese merchants clearly has the ambition to monopolize the market, so on July 25 of this year, it promulgated the Regulations on the Import of Ceramics to restrict it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">China's Exports to the Dutch East Indies <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>There are not many Chinese engaged in the ceramic business in the Dutch East Indies, and the situation is getting worse. According to the Customs Report compiled and published by the Statistics Bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1928 and 1929, the total value of China's ports and Hong Kong's annual imports to the Dutch East Indies was about 140,000 guilders. In 1930, it decreased to 126,000 guilders. In 1931, it continued to decrease, with a total of 98,000 guilders. In 1932, it was only 52,000 guilders. European and American products have also not been imported in large quantities in recent years due to the impact of the economic downturn and high costs. Therefore, Japanese goods are the most common household ceramic products in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Restricting the Import of Japanese Goods <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Now that the government of the Dutch East Indies has regulations to restrict the import of Japanese goods, all Chinese ceramic merchants should take this opportunity to work hard to promote sales in order to develop. It is hoped that domestic ceramic merchants will pay close attention to it. The restriction regulations were promulgated on July 25 and came into effect on the 26th, with a validity period of three months. The full text of the regulations has a total of 13 articles, and its main points are approximately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Import Quantity Regulations <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>During the three-month period of validity of the regulations, except for those ordered to be imported by the Dutch East Indies government, the ceramics and their quantities that are allowed to be imported are as follows: (1) Statistics number, from 423 to 435 (coarse ceramics from item A to item G) 53,000 dozen; (2) Statistics number 436 (other coarse ceramics) 325,000 dozen; (3) Statistics number from 437 to 445 (fine ceramics from item a to item f) 1,175,000 dozen; (4) Statistics number 444 and 446 (fine ceramics from 7 to item g) 785,000 kg; (5) Statistics number 447 (ceramic tableware and refined luxury goods) 408,000 kg.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Distribution of Import Quantity <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The distribution of the import quantity in the preceding paragraph is divided into the following three groups: (1) Importers who are within the territory of the Dutch East Indies, have been approved by the Minister of Economy, and have joined the European Chamber of Commerce for at least four months before January 1, 1934, or have been recognized by the Minister of Economy as similar organizations, such as the Batavia Importers Association and the Hantang Colonial Exporters Association, may have their import quantity determined by the Minister of Economy, accounting for 60% of the total quantity in the preceding paragraph; (2) Importers who do not fall under the provisions of the preceding paragraph may have their import quantity determined by the Minister of Economy, accounting for 40% of the total quantity in the preceding paragraph; (3) If the quantity of the previous 60% is not full, the Minister of Economy may add the remaining quantity to the 40% of importers, or keep it for issuing special permits.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Application for Import Procedures <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>From the date of implementation of these regulations, those who intend to import the ceramics listed in the preceding paragraph must have a permit issued by the Minister of Economy or in the name of the Minister. The permit shall be issued by the applicant signing a request form, and should state the quantity of each type of ceramic to be imported and the quantity of each type of goods imported by the applicant in 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Import Quantity Standard <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The standard for the distribution of import quantity, regarding the importers who account for 60% of the total quantity, should be determined by the Minister of Economy in proportion to their benefits, consulting the opinion of the five-member committee appointed by the board of directors of the Batavia Importers Association. The quantity obtained by the importers who account for 40% of the total quantity is proportional to the quantity of such goods they imported in 1933, but shall not exceed one-quarter of the quantity of such goods they imported in that year.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Taxpayers Association Asks the Municipal Council to Pay Attention to Two Points <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>1.  Changing the Amount of Rent is Actually Increasing the Donation</p>
<p>2.  If Tax Revenue Decreases, the Vacant House Donation Should Be Reported Immediately</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, based on Chen Tingrui's lawyer representing the Great China Hotel and others, requested that the Donations Office of the Municipal Council increase the estimated amount, and sent letters to the Municipal Council and replied to Lawyer Chen as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Letter to the Municipal Council <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Gentlemen, According to a letter from lawyer Chen Tingrui, "According to the managers of our clients, the Great China Hotel, Oriental Hotel, Huizhong Hotel, Wugong Hotel, Juelu Hotel, New World Hotel, and Great Shanghai Hotel, they recently received letters from the Donations Office of the Municipal Council, and the rent of all our establishments was re-estimated according to the Donations Office's own free will, in order to be the standard for the actual 14% general donation. For example, the original rent of the Great China Hotel was 31,888 yuan, and the increased rent was 48,000 yuan, an increase of more than 50%. The original rent of the Oriental Hotel was 50,400 yuan, and the increased rent was 74,400 yuan, an increase of slightly less than 48%. The original rent of the Huizhong Hotel was 36,502 yuan, and the increased rent was 56,700 yuan, an increase of 62%. The original rent of the Wugong Hotel was 16,782 yuan, and the increased rent was 20,160 yuan, an increase of 20%. The original rent of the Juelu Hotel was 16,782 yuan, and the increased rent was 22,380 yuan, an increase of 33%. The original rent of the Great Shanghai Hotel was 33,566 yuan, and the increased rent was 42,482 yuan, an increase of 27%. As for the New World Hotel, although a part of the lower-level city room has been returned and the rent has been reduced to 1,600 yuan per month, the Donations Office must insist on calculating the annual rent as 27,000 yuan. Although our hotels and the acting lawyer have repeatedly negotiated and protested, it has been ineffective. Moreover, the Municipal Council recently sent a letter limiting our hotels to appeal to the Municipal Council's own valuation committee within two weeks, otherwise it will be considered tacit consent. Therefore, we request your lawyer to fight the Municipal Council legally again, etc." Having been entrusted by our lawyer, after thinking again and again, we believe that this matter is of great importance, not only involving the interests of a few of our clients, but also related to the interests of all residents of the Public Concession. We believe that your association is the only representative organization of Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession. Over the years, as our taxpayers have defended legal rights and advocated justice, it has been obvious to all. The case at hand is of great importance, and your association should also represent our clients and protest to the Municipal Council, asking it to collect general donations according to the rent as usual, and not to overcharge in order to show fairness and protect legal rights. The above has been reported to the association. Now, please pay attention to the following two points: (1) Changing the amount of rent during the taxpayers' meeting and increasing it. Although the donation rate is still 14%, it is actually increasing the donation, making the resolution of the taxpayers' meeting invalid. This is a command to change the law. (2) If the market is declining, there are more vacant houses, and tax revenue is decreasing, the resolution of the general assembly of our association to collect general donations on vacant houses should be implemented immediately to increase tax revenue. Correspondingly, we ask you to investigate and not allow conflicts between legislation and administration to occur and shake. This is addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Re-Statement by Lawyer Chen <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Addressing the matter directly: I have received your letter dated October 13th, concerning the arbitrary overestimation of rents for the Great China Hotel and other properties by the Public Concession Works Department Donation Office, with the intention of illegally increasing donations. You requested that I protest to the bureau and provide answers to two points: (1) Whether the Public Concession Works Department's collection of a 1.4% general donation is based on the residents' rents as a standard, or whether it can be freely estimated by the department; (2) Whether the rent valuation committee established by the Public Concession Works Department has been formally recognized by this association. I have reviewed this carefully.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Public Concession Works Department Donation Office's actions, on the one hand, given the daily decline of the market and the increasing number of vacant properties, are due to powerful forces obstructing them from implementing the resolution of this session's representative assembly regarding the collection of general donations on vacant properties. Therefore, they intend to evade the "no increase in donation rate" resolution of the taxpayers' meeting by covertly increasing rents to achieve the reality of increased donations. For example, the Great China Hotel's rent has been increased by over 50%, which is equivalent to increasing the donation rate by half, from 1.4% to 2.1%. Other cases can be deduced similarly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those in charge disregard the suffering of the public and exhaust resources for personal gain, to demonstrate their ability to collect taxes. In reality, this kind of action is absolutely illegal. Since the taxpayers' meeting has already resolved that the donation rate for this year will not be increased and will remain at 1.4%, the number of all rents, except for landlords increasing rents, newly built houses with newly determined rents, and discovered underreported rents, cannot be changed by the executors. Otherwise, it would be an "order changing the law." This cannot and should not be allowed by the members of a self-governing body known for its rule of law. If it is not vigorously corrected and allowed, then even if the donation rate is not increased, the standard (rent) number will be increased, and the taxpayers' total donation burden will have increased. The taxpayers' resolution will have been used to cover up the situation. What power will they have to stop the executors from increasing the taxpayers' burden and to form a politically balanced stalemate with the executors?</p>
<p>The implications of this case are not just about the few companies like the Great China Hotel, nor just about the hotel industry, but about all taxpayers. Moreover, in the view of this association, it is shaking the very foundation of the rule of law within this concession. The seriousness of the situation is beyond what those who specialize in collecting taxes can comprehend. Therefore, this association will continue to protest.</p>
<p>Regarding whether the Public Concession Works Department's collection of a 1.4% general donation is based on rent as a standard or can be freely estimated, although the regulations of the Yangjingbang Real Estate Charter belong to the latter, the real estate situation in this concession was different when that charter was created. It was mostly self-built for personal use. Given the circumstances at the time, it could not be otherwise. Later, "rental housing" emerged, and rents were still estimated, but always below the actual rent, just as current real estate valuations are below market prices. This article, which was a good method for the bureau to encourage or cultivate tax sources, was originally a policy and not very consistent with the principles of taxation. Later, donations were collected based on actual rents, so tax collectors had the practice of verifying rent receipts, and landlords had the responsibility to report rent amounts. Those who falsely reported rent amounts were penalized by the court (see page 16, line 5 of this association's important documents from the 22nd year of the Republic of China). Otherwise, these actions would be like child's play. As for self-produced and self-used houses, which originally had no rent amount, they inevitably had to be estimated, but the number should be based on the number at the time the taxpayers' meeting decided on the donation rate and should never be changed afterwards. Moreover, it must be based on land prices and commodity prices as a standard. However, land prices and commodity prices in Shanghai are trending downwards, so even if changes are desired, they should only be reductions. Moreover, these changes must be decided by the taxpayers' meeting. If executors can change them freely, then what need is there for a taxpayers' meeting?</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the Public Concession Works Department's rent valuation committee, it is an affiliated agency of the Public Concession Works Department and has no legal basis, whether written or unwritten. This association has not recognized it. I am corresponding to reply, hoping you will look into it. This is addressed to Lawyer Chen Tingrui.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Approves Factory's Dismissal Order</p>
<p>Workers' Conference Demands Withdrawal of Order</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Great China Rubber Factory in Jili Bridge previously had a dispute over preventing the labor union from collecting membership dues, and Wang Diansheng, who went to the factory to investigate with the party department representative, and Xu Agen, who went to the court to observe the proceedings, were arrested. The Special Second Court held a trial yesterday afternoon. As a result, none of the above four had any suspicion of assault. The city party department sent personnel to the scene to testify, and the court immediately approved bail and release. Wang Diansheng and others are currently union directors. They were previously female workers in the ball shoe department who had their wages reduced. After representatives negotiated with the factory, they were resented and immediately announced their dismissal. The case has undergone mediation by the city Social Affairs Bureau but has not been resolved. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau suddenly sent an approval order, specifically approving the factory's dismissal of Wang Diansheng and others. When the district labor union received the above order, it immediately convened an emergency meeting, considering the matter to be of great importance. Chairman Shi Qingquan reported briefly and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Comrade Wang Diansheng and others have been granted bail by the court. How should the case be handled? Resolved: Handled by the standing director. (2) Secret. (3) The city Social Affairs Bureau has approved the dismissal of Wang Diansheng and nine others. How should the case be handled? Resolved: A.

<p>Xia Lifafa, 56 years old, a local farmer residing at No. 260, Panjiawan, Tanziwan, Zhabei, has a widowed daughter-in-law, Chen, who is now 41 years old. Chen has three daughters, the eldest being 16 years old. Usually, the family lives by Chen's work outside. Recently, Xia Lifafa learned that Chen was having an affair with Jin Guichen, a 48-year-old vegetable vendor living next door. Feeling that it was a disgrace to the family, he often quarreled with his daughter-in-law and Jin Guichen. The day before yesterday, after being slightly humiliated by Jin, Xia Lifafa suddenly had suicidal thoughts. He took a kitchen knife and sneaked into Jin's house while Jin was not home, slashing him in the waist. Jin immediately fell to the ground in a pool of blood with his abdomen cut open and his intestines flowing out. At that time, Xia Chen was out picking wool. Only Xia Lifafa's granddaughters were at home. After learning about it, they cried and reported to the nearby Tanziwan Police Station, which dispatched officer Liu Jianchen to the scene and sent the injured man to the Second Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, his life was hanging by a thread.

<p>Both Sides Eager for Private Fighting</p>
<p>A Ningbo native, nicknamed Tang Beef, who was a fishmonger residing on the mezzanine floor of No. 20, Fuxing Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, went to a flatbread stall at No. 48, Lane Entrance at 1 a.m. yesterday because he was hungry. He used three copper coins to buy baked buns to fill his stomach and asked the stall owner to reheat the buns in the oven, but the stall owner refused, leading to a quarrel. The stall owner and his shop assistants (all from Shandong) beat Tang Beef. Tang, being outnumbered, returned home and, together with his roommate, a Ningbo native nicknamed Rotten Sand Yuan, went to argue and reprimand the flatbread stall owner. People persuaded them to return. Unexpectedly, the flatbread stall owner gathered more than ten fellow villagers, each holding iron rulers and bayonets, and rushed to No. 20, Fuxing Lane, to provoke Tang Beef, beating anyone they encountered. They slashed and injured Yang Sheng, the son of the second landlord of the building, in the head. The heads of Tang Beef and Rotten Sand Yuan were both broken by the Shandong people with iron rulers, and blood flowed all over their faces. The stall owner and others, seeing that their goal had been achieved, dispersed in a rush. Later, the patrolling police arrived and took the three injured people to the police station for treatment and then sent detectives to the flatbread stall and arrested the stall owner and three shop assistants for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Patriotic Martyr Pan Hongsheng Released from Prison on Bail Yesterday Morning <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Immediately Sent to a Doctor for Treatment in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Various Circles Set to Meet on the 18th to Discuss Assistance</p>
<p>According to Xinxin She, the patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, suffering from tuberculosis, had his family member Pan Shi apply for bail for medical treatment, which was approved by the Second Branch of the High Court. Pan Shi, along with acting lawyer Ma Junshuo, went to the Tilanqiao Prison yesterday morning to provide bail and lead him out of prison for medical treatment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Arrest Details) Pan Hongsheng, 22 years old, from Suzhou, was a student in a paper shop. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, he participated in the Blood Soul Elimination Traitor Group (also known as the National Soul Elimination Traitor Group) with Liu Chongwu, Tian Shuiyang, and others, hoping to warn奸商 merchants who sell enemy goods. He threw bombs or gave warnings to Sun Guangxing Clock Shop, Mao Tai Xin Foreign Goods Shop, and other places. Later, on November 28th, Liu Chongwu was arrested, leading to the arrest of Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, and others. They were subsequently sentenced to twelve years in prison by the court. Later, after lawyer Ma Junshuo appealed on their behalf, the Second Branch of the High Court changed the sentence to six years.</p>
<p>(Release Details) At 9 a.m. yesterday, Pan Shi, accompanied by lawyer Ma Junshuo and Chen Binghui and Chen Jiufeng from the Patriotic Martyr Support Association, went to Tilanqiao Prison to meet Warden Wanant. After explaining the reasons, the warden ordered the prison guard to bring out inmate No. 1654 (Pan Hongsheng), verified his identity, and, after Chen Binghui provided surety, led him out of prison. They rode in cars to Lawyer Ma's office for a brief rest. In the afternoon, Pan Shi accompanied him to Dr. Yu Yunxiu's clinic for treatment. It is reported that his condition is quite serious and it is planned to send him to the Red Cross for treatment this morning.</p>
<p>(Serious Illness) Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Xinxin She went to Lawyer Ma's office to inquire and happened to meet Pan Hongsheng. He was wearing a dark blue padded shirt and plain colored cloth shoes. His head was shaved, his eyes were dull, his face was haggard, like white paper, and he was in low spirits. His voice was weak and feeble when talking. He was skinny as a rake. It was clear at a glance that he was suffering from severe tuberculosis. The reporter briefly inquired about the situation in prison, saw that he could not talk much, and left.</p>
<p>(Assistance from All Circles) Chen Binghui and others from the Patriotic Martyr Support Association believed that after the release of the young man Pan Hongsheng on bail, he would need to recuperate immediately. However, his situation was very difficult. His parents were old and would have to do everything possible to raise money for their son's treatment. Therefore, they specifically planned to convene the Patriotic Martyr Support Association at 2 p.m. on the 18th of this month to discuss assistance methods for recuperation.</p>

<p>The Xihu Highway has been under construction for half a year since its commencement. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency met with the construction personnel of the road, who provided a detailed account of the current work situation of the road. According to them, the entire roadbed of the Xihu Highway has now been completely completed. The bridges from Wuxi to Changshu have also been completed. Paving the road surface will begin soon.

<h3 id="e155">A Tumor the Size of a Football Grows on the Bladder Membrane <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Weighing Thirty Pounds</p>
<p>Tu Changsheng's Strange Disease</p>
<p>Tu Changsheng, residing at No. 3, Dingjia Lane, West Baoxing Road, Zhabei, originally had a hernia. Last summer, a tumor suddenly grew next to his bladder membrane, initially the size of a citron. Although he felt swollen, he did not pay much attention to it. Over time, it grew larger and larger, and his crotch became burdensome, as if a ball was hanging. He staggered when he walked, which was very painful for Tu. He had no choice but to use a large piece of cloth to bag the tumor and tie it around his neck, barely able to walk, suffering greatly. Recently, unable to bear it any longer, he sought treatment at the Shanghai Sanatorium, run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Shenjiawan. After examination by Dr. Bu Mingde, he was deemed to be treatable with surgery. The surgery was performed yesterday afternoon, and the fleshy tumor, as large as a football, was separated from Tu. When placed in a container, it weighed no less than thirty pounds. It was truly a strange disease. According to our reporter, this type of disease is rare. The cause of the disease is not just one, but eating unclean pork and greasy oil are major causes of the disease. Fortunately, the patient resolutely ordered the doctor to remove it, not only eliminating the tumor of more than a year at once, but also liberating himself. The tumor has now been preserved by the sanatorium for medical research, which will greatly contribute to the exploration of the cause of the disease.</p>

<p>The Two Prisoners Admit Attempting to Escape Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Zhang Huicai, Zhao Yunzu, Liu Agui, and other three prisoners serving sentences for theft in the Jiangsu Second Special District Prison on Xuehuali Road, French Concession, colluded to tear cloth into strips and twist them into ropes to escape. At about 3 a.m. on September 5th, just as the prisoners were being unlocked to go to the meal room to receive their meals, Zhang and Zhao ordered Liu to climb the wall using the rope to escape. However, Liu lost his footing due to panic and fell from a high place, injuring his head. The guards discovered this and put Zhang and Zhao in heavy shackles and placed them in separate rooms. Liu died due to ineffective treatment. Zhang and Zhao were transferred to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special Court for investigation and prosecution. This case has been previously reported. After prosecutor Wang Ren concluded the investigation and several court hearings, he filed a public prosecution based on the crime of attempted escape under the criminal law. At the same court's criminal court, chief judge Wang Gangxu, along with prosecutor Wang, held a criminal hearing in the first court yesterday to interrogate them and summoned prison warden Wang Baochang and guards Xiao Wenyin, Nie Zhenchun, and Fu Maoshun to the case to testify. First, the prosecutor stated the intention of the prosecution. Then, Huang Huicai and Zhao Yunzu were interrogated, and they admitted that they had attempted to escape unsuccessfully. The rest of their confessions were the same as those given in the investigative court. Zhang also presented a piece of paper filled with tiny writing, detailing the abuse and beatings in prison and requesting the court to investigate and redress his grievances. The court verified the confessions and ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing. The two prisoners were still sent to prison for execution.</p>

<p>Continued to Hold the Second Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The brokerage industries in this city have submitted petitions to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the brokerage rules and tax collection rules issued by the City Finance Bureau be difficult to implement and request a transfer for improvement. The City Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of various brokerage industries on the 27th of last month and passed six resolutions, which the City Chamber of Commerce sent to the Finance Bureau for adoption. The association received a reply from the Finance Bureau, which extended the verification deadline to October 31 but did not accept the rest. Therefore, it convened a second joint meeting of various brokerage industries at 1 p.m. yesterday. Sun Mingqi and Yuan Hongjun, representatives of the City Chamber of Commerce, Rao Hanzhang, Shao Yunxuan, and Zhang Xilin, representatives of the Chicken and Duck Industry Association, Fei Tinghua of the Medicinal Materials Industry, Qiu Liangyu and Yu Zhiqing of the Local Goods Industry, Xin Wenyao of the Pig Industry, Zhu Weinan of the Tree Firewood Industry, Xin Dingsan of the Charcoal Industry, Xue Meiting of the Sugar Industry, Sun Guchen of the Fresh Fish Industry, Shao Baoxing of the Seafood Sundries Industry (Li, proxy), Cai Runshan of the Fruit Local Goods Industry, Zhu Jinwen and Qu Shunshang of the Miscellaneous Firewood Industry, Cai Yikun and Gu Xinyi of the Bean Rice Industry (Zhu, proxy), Ma Jiliang of the Wood Industry, Zhu Shujian of the Liang Shaojiu Industry, Ma Fuxing and Xu Menghua of the Brick Ash Industry, Cheng Youfu of the Flower Industry, and other more than 60 representatives from more than 20 industries attended. Chairman Sun Mingqi first reported on the Finance Bureau's reply and the letters from various industry associations. Then, representatives from the sugar, seafood sundries, and brick ash industries reported that their industries were not acting as agents for buying and selling and were not responsible for profits and losses, which was inconsistent with the brokerage rules set by the Finance Bureau, and requested that the City Chamber of Commerce transfer the request to cancel the brokerage license. After further statements by the representatives about the reasons why limiting commissions was inappropriate and the time was tight, it was resolved to elect representatives based on the resolutions of the previous meeting to reason with the Finance Bureau together with the representatives of the City Chamber of Commerce. The authorities must understand the transaction situation of the local brokerage industry and quickly amend the business rules and tax collection rules. Cai Runshan, Ni Baizhai, Gu Xinyi, Rao Hanzhang, and Xin Wenyao were elected as representatives on the spot. The date will be decided by the City Chamber of Commerce and then notified to the representatives to go together. Other important cases were discussed at the end before the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Having Walked Through Twenty-Nine Countries, Experiencing Immense Hardship</p>
<p>Next Year, He Will Go to Soviet Russia and Return Home via Siberia</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Deming, a young walker, joined the Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group two years ago and set off from Shanghai. At that time, those who joined the group included Ms. Qiu Fang, etc. Later, due to physical reasons, they all withdrew one after another. When they arrived in Annam (Vietnam), only Mr. Pan Deming remained. However, Mr. Pan did not become discouraged by the withdrawal of his comrades. On the contrary, this prompted his ambition to walk around the world. Mr. Huang Jingwan, an educator in this city, recently received a letter from Mr. Pan from the United States, along with many newspaper clippings detailing that Mr. Pan had completed his journey through twenty-nine countries, experiencing immense hardship along the way. His footprints could be found in countries such as England, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Annam, India, Yugoslavia, and so on. Foreign newspapers and magazines not only provided detailed accounts of him but also hailed him as a "Chinese Hero." Mr. Pan plans to go to Soviet Russia next year and return home via Siberia, he said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government had previously attached a "Municipal Weekly" to the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers every week from 1927 to 1929. Later, it was temporarily suspended due to the separate publication of the "Municipal Gazette." Recently, in order to facilitate general citizens' access to municipal news, an agreement has been reached with the Morning Post to continue publishing the "Municipal Weekly" starting from the first of next month, which will be delivered with the Morning Post. Mr. Zhu Gengshi, Director of the Compilation Division of the Municipal Government, has been appointed to be in charge of the editing of the weekly.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Municipal Health Bureau Plans to Build Kilns to Incinerate Plague Pigs <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Due to the large number of plague pigs dying this year, the Livestock Inspection Station of the Wusong Health Bureau, coupled with the fact that there are no rendering plants for dead pigs in Shanghai, has resulted in the daily consignment of plague pigs seized by the health bureaus of Pudong Yangjing, South Shanghai Xuejiabang, West Shanghai, and Zhabei to the Wusong rendering plant by truck. Because the plant receives more than forty pigs from various places every day, it is unable to render them all in time, and those that have become rotten are buried in pits. As a result, a foul odor permeates the surrounding area, and Chinese and Western tourists visiting Songbin (Wusong) hold their noses as they pass by. Tang Chengzong, a member of the Wusong Municipal Committee, submitted a request to the municipal government to relocate the rendering plant for the sake of public health, as detailed in previous newspaper reports. It is now learned that the Health Bureau, recognizing that it is impossible to dispose of these rotten plague pigs, has repeatedly consulted on disposal methods but has not yet found a satisfactory solution. It is now heard that it has been agreed to imitate the method of incinerating toxic substances by judicial authorities and build two large cement kilns next to the rendering plant to incinerate the plague pigs. The municipal government instructed the Public Works Bureau yesterday to send personnel to Wusong to survey the site for kiln construction, draw up plans, and submit them to the municipal government. Construction will begin as soon as the order is given. If this method is implemented, the relocation of the rendering plant will likely become a pipe dream.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chen Yingfei and Other Members of the Jinjiang Fritillaria Marketing Cooperative Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Make Important Statements</p>
<p>Chen Yingfei, a member of the Jinjiang Fritillaria Marketing Cooperative in Yin County, and Shao Risheng, a representative for auditing accounts, have come to Shanghai to seek support from public opinion on the fritillaria issue. Chen and Shao made the following statements:</p>
<p>(Statement by Chen Yingfei) (1) Farmers' Hopes for Cooperatives: In recent years, the national economy has declined, and cooperatives are the only way to save rural areas. This is well known. Therefore, before the establishment of the fritillaria cooperative, farmers had high expectations. What they hoped for was reasonable promotion of sales channels, expansion of uses, increase in production, improvement in quality, and elimination of manipulation and exploitation by intermediaries to stabilize the rural economy. As for the selling price, they would be satisfied if it could be maintained at 70 to 80 yuan per dan for a long time. However, the fact that the cooperative has entered into an exclusive sales contract with the four pharmaceutical firms to restrict production is not what the members want to hear. (2) Production and Sales Volume in Recent Years: In previous years, the average annual production of fritillaria was about 800,000 jin, and the sales volume was always around 700,000 jin (suddenly reduced to 320,000 jin after the establishment of the cooperative). The price ranged from 60 to 70 yuan to 80 to 90 yuan. This was due to the relationship between good and bad harvests. However, if the price is slightly higher, the sales volume will inevitably decrease. Farmers are well aware of the cause-and-effect relationship between high prices and sluggish sales. Therefore, the current cooperative's policy of drastically raising prices and restricting production is considered by farmers to be a suicidal policy. (3) The Harm of Not Digging Up Fritillaria: Fritillaria reproduces by having mother and child bulbs. When planted this year, one becomes two next year (according to the law, one should be dug up, leaving one for seed). If it is not dug up, two will become four the year after next. The space occupied by fritillaria in the soil cannot be expanded due to the reproduction of fritillaria. As a result, the fritillaria squeeze each other, the volume is reduced, and the juice dries up, which greatly affects the medicinal effect. Therefore, the method of not digging up the soil is an immoral act. (4) High Fritillaria Prices, Members Not Benefiting: After the establishment of the cooperative, although the selling price of fritillaria has soared several times, the members have not benefited. In the past, when farmers freely sold one dan, they could get the full value of one dan immediately for their normal use. Now, the members of the cooperative receive 60 yuan per dan (the same amount as they would get from free sales), which is paid in four installments over a period of one year. The loss is huge as they receive small amounts sporadically on weekdays. (5) Currently, the members of the cooperative account for about three-quarters of all farm households. Some do not want to join. In theory, the cooperative should win the trust of farmers so that those who have not joined will naturally want to join. However, they do not try to do this. Those who want to save rural areas should be heartbroken when they hear this. (6) Unexpected Disaster: I have 4.5 mu of fritillaria fields, and my family is fairly well-off. As the head of the Dunzong Elementary School in the sixth district of Yin County, I have some knowledge. Seeing that the cooperative violated the principles, I could not help but say something unpleasant. As a result, I was resented by others. On May 20, I was falsely accused of privately digging up fritillaria. My three houses were torn down, and my documents, clothes, and utensils were burned. The mulberry and bamboo trees were cut down, and my 4.5 mu of fritillaria fields were completely destroyed. My wife and I were seriously injured. Although the local court sentenced Cui Qian to one year of imprisonment and Zhou Niangzi to three years, the civil part has not yet been settled. My family is broken and injured, and we have no food or shelter. My parents and wife are always sad. (7) Members Have Completely Lost Faith in the Directors: The members' faith in the directors of the cooperative has been completely lost. The resolution not to dig up the soil has already been completely destroyed. Therefore, they had to convene an extraordinary general meeting of representatives on October 3 to resolve to allow digging up the soil. (8) Omitted.</p>

<p>The Construction Bank, founded by wealthy merchants such as Zhao Zhongying, has strong financial resources and a solid foundation. It has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and has obtained a business license. The opening ceremony was held at 8:30 a.m. yesterday in the bank's auditorium at 144 Tianjin Road. Zhao Zhongying, the chairman of the bank, unveiled the plaque. The ceremony included (1) raising the flag, (2) cutting the ribbon, and (3) opening. More than a thousand people from all walks of life went to congratulate, including Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Qin Runqing, Xie Taofu, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Jiqing, Yu Zuoting, You Jusheng, Yuan Ludeng, etc. The doors were filled with carriages and horses, and the guests were seated.

According to Chen Xunru, the manager of the bank, in recent years, China's economy has declined, and an atmosphere of depression has enveloped society. Commerce has withered and industries have failed everywhere, presenting a situation of collapse. This is an undeniable fact. The reason for this is none other than the lack of economic circulation. Our bank has been preparing for several months and has been officially opened today. In the future, we will serve society faithfully, take the adjustment of the market finance as our responsibility, and hope to use the power of the bank to help the development of industry and promote the revival of society.</p>

<p>Materials are Entirely Domestic Goods</p>
<p>To Suit the Living of the Middle and Lower Classes</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of building new villages has been prevalent in Shanghai. However, most of the buildings are Europeanized and full of extravagance, which are definitely not suitable for ordinary people to live in. Moreover, most of the materials are imported, so that more new villages are built, the more money flows out. This is very noteworthy. Now, Tai Shuangqiu, Tang Maohuai, Wang Jinyi, and other members of the Nian'er Society in West Shanghai have taken this into consideration and gathered more than a dozen comrades to choose a site near Fanwangdu Zhongshan Road to build the Nian'er New Village. All materials, such as bricks, wood, mud, tiles, etc., are entirely domestic goods. The structure is also simple, aiming to be suitable for the living of the middle and lower classes. The Nian'er Society has always advocated domestic goods, practiced social economy, and improved the lives of the people. The construction of the Nian'er New Village is based on these basic conditions. It is now actively underway.</p>

The court, after receiving the petition, ordered Judge Huang Meiqing to summon the tenant representatives to court. After several interrogations, the court ruled the day before yesterday that the temporary ban on demolition, water shutoff, and setting up fences was approved, and the ruling was sent to both parties yesterday for compliance.

<p>The Bingxun Chinese Shorthand School on Carter Road, Shanghai, has achieved remarkable results since its opening. Graduates are able to serve society and are generally satisfied. Recently, the principal of the school, Yang Bingxun, and Yu Binqi, the inventor of the Chinese typewriter, jointly established a senior Chinese typing and shorthand school at the original location. Since the enrollment began only half a month ago, it has already been fully booked. However, students from afar are still rushing to register. The school aims to cultivate real typing and shorthand talents to serve society. Therefore, it does not dare to enroll too many students indiscriminately and expresses its deep apologies.

When the school's second phase of enrollment begins, a notice will be published in the newspaper. Those who have already learned Bingxun shorthand can also transfer to the school at that time.</p>

<p>The Daxin Domestic Silk and Satin Bureau at the intersection of Third Horse Road and Shilu Road is the one and only general agency in this city specializing in the sale of domestic silk and satin. The bureau is well aware of the excellent durability of domestic silk and satin products, which are unmatched by other countries or even non-existent in other countries. Therefore, in the past, silk exports often accounted for a very important position in China's foreign trade. Later, due to the attack of artificial silk and the suicidal psychology of Chinese people who love foreign goods, the export figures gradually decreased, and the original position declined. This formed a situation of silk decline. In order to implement the salvation of silk, the bureau does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of selling foreign goods at the same time, specializing in the sale of domestic silk and satin, making a strong resistance to the call to protect the national economy and the suicidal psychology of loving foreign goods. Now, in order to build up children's love for domestic silk and satin, the bureau has decided to hold a donation of children's clothing fabrics from the 18th. The original thermos bottles and other opening commemorative gifts will still be given as before.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your newspaper's repeated exposure of the hardships faced by the unfortunate refugees who have been unreasonably expelled by the Japanese government. Your reports have aroused sympathy from all walks of life. However, we have found a news item in yesterday's newspaper stating that three refugees, including Jin Zuo-tou, arrived in Shanghai on the Ikoma Maru at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 15th), which is completely inconsistent with the facts. According to our information, the three refugees, including Jin Zuo-tou, arrived in Shanghai on the Ikoma Maru at 3:00 PM on the 14th. At that time, no newspapers published it. Unexpectedly, yesterday's report mistakenly attributed the arrival of the three refugees on the 14th to the 15th, which is inaccurate. This matter concerns the livelihoods of the refugees. Every time refugees are expelled back to Shanghai, it must be recorded in the register for reporting to the central government to request relief. If the dates are inconsistent, it will not match the reporting date of the expelled refugees and will hinder relief efforts. Therefore, we are sending this letter to correct the information and would be grateful if you could publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Representatives of the Committee of Expelled Overseas Chinese from Japan</p>

<h3 id="e187">Awakening to National Self-Reliance and Revival (4) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Manuscript by Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>At the China Vocational Education Society</p>
<p>9. The Awakening of Youth to National Self-Reliance and Salvation: The position and responsibility of Chinese youth today are even greater than those of the general public. Several years ago, I wrote an article calling on the youth of the country to awaken, earnestly hoping that the youth would awaken. Youth are the new life of our nation's future, so the position of youth is particularly important. The mission that youth bear for the nation is also particularly significant. To save the country, youth must first have the awareness to save the country. To be self-reliant, youth must first have the determination to be self-reliant. Otherwise, there is absolutely no hope for the future of the nation. Therefore, we can be disappointed in everything, but we must not be disappointed in youth. However, there are many undeniable illnesses in the youth of today. However, the creation of these illnesses cannot be entirely blamed on the youth. There are many reasons. Analytically speaking, there are four: (1) Historical: Subject to the inertia of Chinese society for thousands of years, decadent and following old ways, not knowing how to invigorate. The decadence of the Six Dynasties is now prevalent in youth academic circles, causing general promising youth to indulge in the pleasures of sensual delights, and unable to extricate themselves. (2) Of the Times: Modern free thought dominates the psychology of ordinary people. The Chinese, misunderstanding freedom, are increasingly becoming unrestrained. When students take major exams, they hope that the teachers will provide the questions, and the narrower the scope, the better. In the past, teachers controlled students, but now students control teachers. It is truly heartbreaking. The spirit of teachers and academic atmosphere must be rectified. (3) Subjective: The youth themselves are indecisive and do not know how to work hard and love themselves, and therefore willingly degenerate. (4) Objective: There are many youths who, although they are willing to work hard, are discouraged by the darkness of politics and society, and therefore there are many who are passive. There are also a small number of political dignitaries and professors who use students as tools, making them unknowingly become increasingly corrupt. This can be regarded as the greatest sin against youth. Our analysis of the illnesses of youth is not to criticize youth, but to indicate the direction of awakening to youth. Although everything now is heartbreaking and disappointing, the future of the nation completely depends on whether the youth of China today can have the determination to thoroughly renew themselves, be self-aware, and be self-reliant. I feel that a youth occupies a particularly important position in the entire national life, so youth should be the first to have the awareness of self-reliance and salvation. The life of youth is the life of the nation's future. The awakening of youth is the awakening of the nation. The progress of youth is the progress of the nation. Conversely, the degeneration of youth is the degeneration of the nation. The decline of youth is also the decline of the nation. You all must hope that our nation can be revived, then you must make the determination to be self-reliant and save the country from today onwards. Do not be pessimistic, do not reduce the courage to work hard because of the current poor state of the nation. It is precisely because the national situation is critical that there is a need to work hard and struggle. Moreover, the affairs of the world are governed by a certain law of cause and effect. Whatever effort is made, there will be a corresponding harvest. A point of effort will have a point of effect. In the past thousands of years, especially in the past hundred years, we have formed the decline of the nation and created today's serious national crisis because we did not know how to work hard and did not know how to catch up. The meaning of life is to constantly strive upwards. The survival of a nation is the continuation of the total hard work of the people. The life of a nation is not due to birth, and the development and strength of a nation cannot be expected in a day or two, but the result of the continuous and permanent efforts of all the people, regardless of gender, age, occupation. In the eighteenth century, Rousseau (J.J. Rousseau) spoke of liberalism, saying, "The will of every person together becomes public opinion." This is the theoretical basis of his democracy. I am speaking of nationalism, so I do not advocate liberalism, but advocate self-reliance. The effort of every citizen combined becomes "national strength." "National strength" is the foundation of national life, but national strength originates from self-reliance and is based on self-reliance, so I want to promote self-reliance to consolidate the foundation of nationalism, to attempt the revival of the nation, and to use self-reliance to revise Rousseau's liberalism. The eighteenth century could produce the famous Rousseau, but the twentieth century, especially China today, is not an era of liberalism, but an era of self-reliance. To save the country, the first priority is self-awareness and self-reliance. Do not learn the superficialities of others. Moreover, liberalism has now failed. There are thousands of ways to save the country, but the fundamental principle is self-reliance. National strength is made up of self-reliance. With national strength, the national fortune can be saved and the nation can be revived. This is not only a natural conclusion in theory, but also an inevitable result in fact. I hope that you will keep this in mind, act promptly, set an example, and turn words into action. Contribute your intelligence and talents to the country, and place the responsibility of saving the country and reviving the nation on yourselves separately. In this way, every citizen can generate the strength of every citizen, and the combined strength of 400 million people in the country will definitely generate unparalleled national strength that can recreate the life of the Chinese nation and restore the inherent glory of our Chinese nation.

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Pitying the Drifting Girl Peeks Through the Door, Wishing to Hear of Hardships, Cherishing Jade Visits a Poor Family</p>
<p>But he didn't dare to walk under the corridor, and stayed far away from Cheng Zhiqian to avoid a direct conflict. Instead, he took a winding path through the center of the courtyard. When Cheng Zhiqian saw her, he couldn't help but feel a stir in his heart. He seemed to have seen this girl somewhere before. Although she didn't shed the appearance of a country girl, she was still clean and tidy, and looked like the daughter of a decent family. He couldn't help but put aside his intention to visit the white man, and focused his attention on this girl. The small-footed woman had already walked up to him, and supported his shoulder, saying: It doesn't matter, I'm very familiar with this place, I come here two or three times almost every day. Most of the teachers here are acquaintances. As she spoke, she walked to the door of Zhang Jiefu's room. The tea boy had already rushed into the room, propped up the door curtain, and nodded with a smile, saying: You don't believe there is an iron bed, come in and take a look. The girl poked her head in and looked, seemingly knowing that there was someone inside, so she said to the small-footed woman: Let's just take a look from outside. The small-footed woman patted her shoulder lightly, saying: You child, you really have no ambition. When you heard it was nice to look at, you wanted to come and see. Now that you're here, you don't want to go in. What are you afraid of with me here? After saying this, she took the girl's hand and went into the room. Cheng Zhiqian suddenly realized that this was Li Shilian, the refugee girl that Li Shilian had mentioned yesterday. He had met this girl on the ferry in Xianyang, so he remembered that her face looked familiar. Since she was a refugee girl, he shouldn't scheme against her, and couldn't help but walk over to see what they were doing, with a bit of a monitoring flavor. As he thought this, Li Shilian also came out of the room. Zhang Jiefu asked a question in the room, "Is this girl also surnamed Hu?" Then he said: "Mr. Li, Mr. Cheng, please come in and sit, I have a visitor here." The girl felt embarrassed in the room, and when she saw two more people outside the window, she pulled the small-footed woman out. Li Shilian smiled and nodded to him, saying: "I also live here, won't you sit for a while?" (41)</p>
<h3 id="e189">Shaoxing Ballads <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Shaoxing has probably heard of the so-called "Three-Piece Ballads" or seen signs reading "So-and-So's Three-Piece Ballads" hanging one after another near Guanzhu Bridge and Tazi Bridge. The singers of the ballads are all blind people, and they sing together as men and women. The instruments they use are the sanxian, erhu, and yangqin, so they are called "Three-Piece." There are also "Five-Piece" versions, which add an additional erhu and a pipa to the "Three-Piece" ensemble. Among the instruments, the sanxian is the most important. This is similar to the drum and clapper in Peking opera, which are all played by blind men.</p>
<p>When people have celebrations or other events, they often call them to play and sing to liven things up. The price for a performance is said to range from three to five yuan, depending on the generosity of the family celebrating. When those blind people are hired, they actually change into a set of silk clothes, put on a pair of black glasses, and grope their way through the market, which is quite amusing to see. But rather than saying it's amusing, it's more pitiful, because their lives are very hard.</p>
<p>The origin of the ballads cannot be verified, but some say they evolved from Pingdiao (level tone). The tunes are mostly靡靡之音 (decadent music). What they sing is, of course, stories about the joys and sorrows of young masters and young ladies. Before singing the main text, they usually sing a pair of short lyrics called "Jie Shi" (connecting poems). This is similar to Suzhou storytellers singing a pair of opening verses first. It is said that learning to sing the ballads is not easy either. If you can sing the line "曾記梨花細雨天" (I remember the pear blossoms on a drizzly day) in tune, the teacher can have a big "生炒脚魚" (fried soft-shelled turtle) feast. So they have a saying: "曾記梨花細雨天, 生炒脚魚要吃大半年" (I remember the pear blossoms on a drizzly day, I'll be eating fried soft-shelled turtle for half a year). As for why they have to use "fried soft-shelled turtle" to thank the teacher, that is not known. The scripts of the ballads are only passed down orally; it is difficult to investigate them; otherwise, they could be used as a great material for studying popular literature.</p>

<p>The telegraph office has launched social telegrams, charging only three cents per word. Sending a social telegram is like sending an express letter, which is very popular. Therefore, the post office also has a so-called "ordinary express delivery" method, which charges twice as much as ordinary letters, but seven cents less than express letters. The "middle way" will surely be popular!</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Impoverished Scholars of Yangzhou <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Speaking of the impoverished scholars of Yangzhou, I have to say "culture has declined." Originally, these so-called impoverished scholars are a kind of disguised beggar. Although there are many literary beggars in Shanghai who make a living by writing, those literary beggars make a living by selling their writings, and do not really go begging. Only these impoverished scholars of Yangzhou are indeed genuine "literary beggars."</p>
<p>Some of these impoverished scholars have indeed experienced the "ten years of cold window," but unfortunately their fate was not good and they were unable to "achieve fame in one fell swoop." In the past, they could still find a job as a private tutor to make a living, but now, with schools everywhere, who would hire you, a sour scholar of 之乎者也? Therefore, for the sake of making a living, they had to embark on the path of impoverished scholars. The begging locations for the impoverished scholars are teahouses and families with happy events. Therefore, the people of Yangzhou are a little afraid of these impoverished scholars, because if they are not entertained well, and their desires are not satisfied, they often slam the table and make a lot of noise, causing "teapots and teacups to fly together, and benches and tables to dance together," which would not make the guests unhappy? Therefore, they are always treated with all kinds of perfunctory responses, and their arrogance is getting higher and higher!</p>
<p>Among the impoverished scholars, there are indeed many sons of fallen nobles, but most of them are only rudimentarily literate and use the words "impoverished scholar" as a protective charm for begging. We should naturally help those genuine scholars and provide them with a place to live and a way to make a living; however, those fake impoverished scholars should also be banned in order to maintain the dignity of scholars.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager suddenly turned her gaze to the east, her face facing Fengtian; she was still muttering to herself intermittently, but because her voice was too low, I couldn't hear clearly what she was saying. Her eyes revealed a strange emotion, as if she had discovered some figures or scenes at a very distant distance, so she was attracted to it; however, none of us had such illusions, we just followed her old self and looked westward randomly.</p>
<p>Finally, the old Buddha had looked enough by herself, and then returned to the car, ordering it to start.</p>
<p>The train, of course, was still moving very slowly, slowly leaving the station like an earthworm, staggering step by step towards the gap in the Great Wall. When our locomotive rolled into the border of the Northeast, we were still lingering within the mainland of China! Then, our yellow train left the Middle Earth one by one and entered our hometown. Although I don't have a deep sense of place, but according to the facts, the Northeast is indeed our hometown that we cannot deny! Our ancestors grew up on this land.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Old Buddha, the Yehenala clan, are also natives here. The Northeast also created an unparalleled figure for China, who made China's entire history greatly change because of him. That is none other than Nurhaci, the founding emperor of the Qing Dynasty! Later, the emperors of the Qing Dynasty, from Shunzhi, Kangxi, Yongzheng, Qianlong, Jiaqing, Daoguang, Xianfeng (the Empress Dowager's husband)...to Guangxu, were all descendants of Nurhaci.

<h3 id="e194">The Fresh Water Chestnuts of Suzhou <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Tianyu</p>
<p>In my hometown of Suzhou, it is now the time when the water chestnuts in the ponds are ripe. The red ones are rouge red, the green ones are emerald green, very bright and very beautiful.</p>
<p>Groups of three to five country girls, twelve or thirteen years old, wearing small shirts of blue cloth with white flowers, rolling up their sleeves high, with bare feet, using bathtubs as boats, pushing bamboo poles, while the boats move slowly, reaching into the heart of the pond, picking and picking. Their mouths are still singing their country songs, the songs are not uniform; but to others, it only feels that their singing is rippling in the autumn sky, exceptionally natural and exceptionally beautiful. Under such a happy mood, they forgot their hardships.</p>
<p>Until the red sun sets in the west, they also sell these abundant harvests to the families by the river. The subtle sounds, with a musical rhythm, are also fascinating. People are attracted by this kind of sound, and they all want to buy some to taste, so the fresh, sweet taste has become widespread among everyone's tongues.</p>
<p>Such things will continue until the season when autumn is deep, the dew is cold, and the grass and trees are yellow.</p>
<p>The water chestnuts here, perhaps, are transported from my hometown? But the quantity does not seem to be much! The water chestnuts in the baskets of the average seller are either scorched yellow or blackened, and the meat inside must have lost its original freshness; except for being able to be taken to make food for small insects like "drop bells," people shouldn't eat them, right? Sometimes they are also mixed with rotten water chestnuts, which is of course even more unacceptable. Therefore, I have never eaten fresh water chestnuts here once.</p>
<p>Little Recipe</p>
<h3 id="e195">Japanese Cuisine (Part 1) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>The two characters for "cuisine" mean "dishes." Japanese cuisine refers to the dishes of the Eastern people, the Japanese. Having stayed in Japan for six years, I am quite familiar with the situation there. I usually paid close attention to the country's customs, habits, and diet. During my stay, I would venture out alone every Sunday to observe social conditions. Besides classmates, my friends included the section chief of the court, the compradore of a company, and several teachers in schools. They were willing to travel with me regardless of seniority. The former principals, Dr. Shida and Dr. Yoshino, as well as the scholar of Chinese studies, Ota, were all friends of my teachers. Because I was a self-funded student, my family could provide some financial support from time to time, which was more comfortable than the government-funded students who were limited to seventy yuan a month. Therefore, I didn't care about the slightest expense when spending money. Moreover, most of my friends were from the middle and upper classes. Naturally, I couldn't avoid socializing with them. I have eaten Japanese food so many times in six years that I have lost count. (Most foreign students live in hotels run by Chinese, or in boarding houses run by Japanese with Chinese kitchens, or rent a room with meals provided by the landlord.) The food they eat on weekdays is usually neither fully Chinese nor fully Japanese. Now, I will tell the readers about the dishes that Japanese people eat and how they eat them, because many friends and colleagues have often asked me about it, wanting to try it. I repeatedly told them that if they ate Japanese food, they would definitely vomit for three days, and it would be better to buy a piece of stinky tofu to eat, which would be more flavorful. However, they always didn't believe me. Now, I will write down the names of various dishes so that you can understand. However, some dishes imitate Chinese-style cooking, which are still acceptable. Most of the other strange dishes that are neither Chinese nor Western nor anything in between are frightening to see, nauseating to smell, and make you want to vomit. If you don't believe me, you might as well try it at a Japanese restaurant run by Japanese expatriates in various ports, and then you will believe it. There are many types of Japanese cuisine. Ordinary formal meals include two soups and five dishes, or two soups and seven dishes, or three soups and seven dishes. Generally, families above the middle class use two soups and five dishes. Other informal cuisines and social customs are like in the north and south of our country, which vary according to local customs.</p>
<p>(1) The formal meal of two soups and five dishes. This kind of formal meal can represent the entirety of Japanese cuisine. Various flavors are probably complete. If you go to a restaurant to eat, each meal costs at least five yuan and no more than ten yuan. The order of serving the formal meal is divided into four times. The first time is called "suimono," which means soup. The Japanese call it "shiimono," which is a covered bowl, a basin, and a small plate. There is a bowl of soup inside, which is a mixture of sea bream and wax gourd. There is also "sunomono," which means vinegared dish, which is made of sea bream and seaweed. There is also a basin of "sakana," which means soy-glazed fish, which is sea bream grilled with salt and soy sauce. The second course is called "honzen," which means the main course, which is a covered bowl, a large bowl, and a small plate. There is a bowl of soup inside, which is made of flour, shiitake mushroom pieces, and yam. ) Sashimi (is a kind of bonito slice, red ark shell meat, white radish, seaweed, shiitake mushroom, siler, and shredded ginger served in a large plate) Tsubo dish (is a mixture of large shrimp, lily bulbs, and shredded shiitake mushrooms) Pickles (are raw green vegetables, radishes, pickled ginger, etc.) The third course is three bowls, called "nizen," which is a flat bowl (yellow croaker, shrimp, winter mushrooms, yam, and Japanese honewort mixed and cooked) A small cup (is a mixture of red root yam and grilled shellfish) Soup (cooked with turnip and orchid) The fourth course is a large bowl, called "sanzen" (which is grilled sea bream) The way they eat formal meals is that when they entertain guests at home, they usually use two soups and five dishes, but the cooking methods vary due to different traditions. There are styles that imitate the court's Shijō school, and there are styles that imitate the warrior's Ogasawara school. Even the order of serving the dishes is not fixed. For example, when eating soup, the maid will bring out the wine. (Male servants are not used in Japan.) The authentic Japanese sake is similar to our country's rose dew wine, sweet and fragrant. When serving wine, the maid holds the wine bottle with both hands. At this time, the man uses his left hand and the woman uses her right hand to pick up the cup, and she pours the wine. The first cold sake is called "reishu." After drinking it, there is also "atsukan" (which is hot sake). If you don't drink alcohol, you can't refuse completely. You should pretend to drink a sip or two. After that, if they pour more, you can politely decline.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Department of Nantong University was founded by the late industrialist Zhang Jian. It is located in the prosperous cotton-producing area of the country, and there are many nearby reclamation companies, which is convenient for teaching and practice. This year, due to its excellent performance, it has received subsidies from the Ministry of Education. Newly hired professors such as Wang Shansan, Tie Ming, Ge Zhiyuan, Yang Zhinong, and Xu Miaoshang are all well-known figures in the agricultural field.

<p>Jinling University in the capital invited Yang Jie, the current president of the Army University, to give a one-hour lecture on "The Principles of National Establishment of European Powers" at the General Manager's Memorial Week on the 15th. Yang Jie had just returned from a tour of Europe and must have gained a lot of knowledge about the current situation and all the facilities of European countries. First, he made a clear and different comparison of the moral concepts of the East and the West. He said that the national concept of the Atlantic Ocean is "helping the strong and destroying the weak," which is based on a principle of "survival of the fittest." Whoever has cannons, airplanes, and tanks is the most respected. However, the East, such as China, has always advocated "supporting the weak and suppressing the strong." He used the rise of the powers and the current international situation to prove the advantages and disadvantages of these two concepts. Finally, he said that if our country wants to become strong, it must change its political concepts and political methods and catch up with the principles of national establishment of European powers, which can achieve rapid results.</p>

<p>The site of the Lintao County Junior Middle School in Gansu Province was originally the old Qing Dynasty Examination Hall.

This spring, the County Education Bureau of the county, in order to develop education and comprehensively plan, gathered local people to present a petition to the provincial government to design and operate on the vacant land of the Confucius Temple, to build new buildings and repair old ones. After four months, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 10, and an amusement fair was attached to commemorate the event.</p>

<p>(Nanchang Correspondent) Chairman Chiang takes strengthening the national physique as the center of national rejuvenation, so under Jiang's earnest instructions, the sports atmosphere in Jiangxi is extremely strong. National martial arts, riding, archery, and water sports are all popular. However, women's sports have always been ignored by the society. In order to encourage women's sports and promote social sports, the Jiangxi Education Department held the first women's sports meeting. The venue was in the public sports field. All the city's women's schools and all female students attended. Fourteen famous sports figures from Shanghai, including Qian Hangsu, also came to Jiangxi to participate in the performance. At 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, twenty-one salutes were fired, and the solemn and magnificent opening ceremony was held. After the ceremony, Director Cheng of the Education Department gave the opening speech, in which he said that Jiangxi's sports were not developed and women were lagging behind. Chiang said that Jiangxi was the center of national rejuvenation, and that he would work hard for fifty years in the future, especially in sports, which should not only be for athletes but should be popularized among the people. Chen Menghuan, the president of the Shanghai East Asia Sports College, gave a speech, saying that women's sports are closely related to children's sports, and that popularizing women's sports is the basic work for strengthening the race and strengthening the country. After the speeches, more than a thousand female students from Nanchang Women's Middle School, Women's Vocational School, No. 1 Middle School, Baoling, and Jianzhong Midwifery School performed group exercises, all in white clothes and black skirts, which were extremely neat. The seven sections of freehand exercises were also quite consistent in movement. After the exercises, the athletes marched around the field for three weeks to the music, and then the competition began, which was divided into two types: performance and competition.</p>

<p>"A'Zhao was beaten to death by you! A'Zhao was beaten to death by you! I don't want dead bones, I want a living A'Zhao! A'Zhao went out alive, how could you replace him with dead bones!"</p>
<p>The woman cried and cried, then suddenly rolled onto the ground again.</p>
<p>A'Zhao's younger brother, A'Ji, looking like a ghost, followed his sister-in-law in. He said, panting:</p>
<p>"My brother was killed by bandits, and now the reserve team has carried his corpse to the entrance of the village. Because they couldn't find the village police, they came to my house."</p>
<p>"Bandits?" Everyone exclaimed in surprise. "What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Yes, bandits." A'Ji yawned, as if he hadn't had enough opium, and said, "This morning, the Black Early team told more than a dozen of them to go to the city to buy vegetables. Each person carried a bamboo pole on their back, like a gun barrel. Things happened to coincide. But then again, there have never been no bandits in the countryside. Now it's getting worse and worse. They walked to Xia Du Village, which is only ten miles away from Lion's Roar Rock. The bandits knew that there were reserve soldiers or something there. When they saw these dozen or so guys carrying bamboo poles on their backs, they thought the reserve soldiers were coming to suppress their bandits. They took these dozen people by surprise and fired a volley of guns, killing four or five people! My brother was shot in the chest and killed!..."</p>
<p>A'Ji spoke and spoke! Finally, his legs seemed unable to support him, and he squatted down on a stone in front of the threshold.</p>
<p>"I want a living person! I want a living person!" A'Zhao's wife was still rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>"This is fate! This is destiny!" Mr. Dasheng shook his head. "I think, I think, the district will always have some compensation!"</p>
<p>"I don't want any compensation! I don't want it! I want a living person! I want a living person! A living, living person!" A'Zhao's wife dragged on the feet of Village Chief Feng Wen.</p>

<p>丨丨 Sweeping Away the Haze and Gloom 丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market experienced a widespread surge, with unprecedentedly high enthusiasm. Foreign exchange rates shrank significantly in a single day, with the shilling losing half a penny and the US dollar rising by one yuan. Consequently, the price of gold soared by 36.9 yuan, yarn prices increased by more than three yuan, and cotton rose by 7.5 jiao. While flour initially showed a decline in the morning, it surged upwards in the afternoon, rising by 6 to 7 fen, and wheat increased by over 1 jiao. There were also reports of rice price increases. All of this is a rebound from the increased silver tax.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Finance. The Gold Market is Surrounded by Buying Amidst the Peculiar Activity of Foreign Exchange. The Longs Confine the Shorts, Who are Driven to Despair. An Astonishing Increase of 36.9 Yuan <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The December futures for the new standard were launched on the gold market yesterday. Major long positions were closed, and the Cantonese syndicate inclined to buy, causing an instant shortage of chips in the market. The buying sentiment was extremely strong, and major short positions, such as Zhengchang, were forced to cover, resulting in an unexpected surge. Before noon, the price broke through the major barriers of 20, 30, 40, and 50. The repeated tightening of the foreign exchange market also fueled buying enthusiasm. Initially, telegrams indicated a consistent surge in the London silver and gold markets, with spot gold rising by 4.5 pence. Exchange rates slightly decreased, and US prices and stocks all declined. However, since our country implemented the increased collection of the equalization tax, foreign exchange news has had little impact. Only general retail investors felt slightly weak, and the initial price was expected to be slightly lower than the old price. After opening, due to the Central Bank's increase of the gold price by one-third, and the sudden shrinkage of the shilling by 0.25 and the US dollar by a small amount, people's confidence was boosted, and buying sentiment was stirred. The Cantonese syndicate placed orders, pushing the price up by over 20 yuan. Later, Chinese merchants frantically bought, but the foreign exchange banks, though trying to sell, felt exhausted, leading to a tightening of the domestic market. Most long positions were unwilling to release, causing panic among the short positions, who scrambled to cover. The January US dollar rate of 36.6875 proved difficult to settle, and it broke through 30 yuan. Later, major players continued to buy, and HSBC's rates were repeatedly revised downwards. Sellers disappeared from the market, and under the pervasive buying sentiment, even 36 yuan for the US dollar proved difficult to settle. Although there were many fluctuations along the way, it finally broke through the 40 yuan barrier. After the noon close, more buyers poured in, and the short positions painfully closed their positions. With chips running dry, the price even broke through the 50 yuan barrier. In the afternoon, the market saw another sharp rise, but the sudden influx of supply at high prices caused the price to retreat to within 50 yuan after opening. HSBC's rates were revised downwards again, and there was still a rebound. However, major players continued to sell aggressively, and rumors circulated that the Central Bank was intervening to maintain the market, causing the price to retreat to within 50 yuan again. Later, rumors circulated that the Central Bank planned to ship silver to exchange for foreign currency to relieve the foreign exchange market in Shanghai. After this, the situation turned weak, and the Central Bank made efforts to sell, causing the domestic market for foreign exchange to loosen and fall again, almost approaching the 40 yuan barrier. However, the short positions still covered at low prices, and Chinese merchants continued to buy aggressively. The domestic market tightened again after loosening, but the banks still lacked appetite to sell. Although Mumbai collectively rose by 9 annas, it had no impact. The gold market was pulled up again. The Associated Press reported that the US opinion was that China's increase in silver tax was the first step in banning silver exports, and that in the future it seemed likely to move towards abandoning the silver standard and adopting gold, causing a great boost in confidence. The US dollar rate of 35.5625 again proved difficult to settle, creating a high price of 957 yuan in a single day. Banks supplied at high prices, and major long positions also slightly released their positions. The market closed slightly lower, but after the close, sellers suddenly poured in, and general sentiment believed that there would be strong supply to adjust the short positions, causing the price to retreat to within 50 yuan. The market situation was unusually firm throughout the day, and the short positions' throats seemed to be in danger of being choked. Under the active efforts of speculators, the price has been raised above the settlement price. If the long positions continue to close their positions, the future surge will be even more intense. Among the new chips, long positions account for only 36, while short positions account for as many as 71, making a short squeeze easy to trigger. The market situation of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 914.3 yuan, down 1.1 yuan from the previous close. Dadesheng, Shunmao, Fu'an, Yuansheng, Yongtongchun, Hengyu, Hengtai and others immediately entered the market. The Central Bank's gold rate rose by 0.03, from 3.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan. Fuyu, Yuanchang, Yongheng, Yu, Dadesheng released their holdings, and it was expected that HSBC's rates would rise by 0.125 for British currency and 0.25 for US currency, retreating to 7.3 yuan. Fuxing, Yongqingfa, Yonghengxing came to buy, and Huabi bought February US dollars at 37 yuan, rising again to 9.7 jiao. Dafa, Yongyuanmao, Yongtianfeng sold, dropping to 8.5 yuan. Later, Chinese merchants rebought December US dollars at 36.875, and with Hengxing, Huixiang, Tongyi, Hengyu competing to buy, the price rose to 21.5 yuan. Qianchang, Xiangyuanmao, Yongyuanchun released their holdings, retreating to 0.1 jiao. The domestic market tightened, and Rongkang, Dadesheng, Fuxing, Yonghuixiang, Hengyu, Qingyu, Yuanxing, Hengxing, Yuanyuanmao, Yongdakang all bought. The January US dollar rate of 36.6875 proved difficult to settle, and the price rose to 6 yuan. Although Yuanyongfeng sold at 4.8 jiao, Huixiang, Fuxing, Yongda, Dadesheng, Hengyu, Dachangxiang all bought, breaking through the 30 yuan barrier and rising to 31 yuan. Huabi offered January shillings at 8.125, and Dalian syndicate, Fu'an, Yuanxing, Fuchang sold, dropping to 27.5 yuan. Dingchang, Hengchang, Yongfu sold from 9.2 jiao to 6 yuan. Before long, the January US dollar rate of 37.375 also proved difficult to settle. Hengxing, Yuqing, Yonghengyu, Dadesheng, Fuxing, Yongqingyu and others came to buy again, pushing the price up to 34.6 yuan. Jiaotong sold January US dollars at 31.125, and Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Fuyu took the opportunity to sell at 30 yuan. News came that HSBC's rates would be further reduced by 0.125 for British currency and 0.375 for US currency. Hengyu, Zhengchang advanced to 5.5 yuan, and Dadesheng, Fu'an and others supplied at high prices, gradually retreating to 1.8 jiao. There was much struggle along the way, and the chips in the market were clearly running dry. Buyers were excited, but there was no supply, so the gold market became even more volatile. Hengxing, Yuqing, Yonghengyu, Yuanxing and others jointly bought, pushing the price up to 40.5 yuan. Yuan Yi, Futaiheng, Hengchangyong took the opportunity to release their holdings, and then retreated to 37.2 jiao. At this time, requests for supply poured in, and there were major ups and downs between 8 and 9 yuan. Finally, with people's hearts trending upwards, major players bought again and again, and the short positions wanted to cover but found it difficult. There was no large supply in the market, and in fact the long positions were unanimously closing their positions, unwilling to release them. The unusual tightness of the foreign exchange market contributed significantly to the rise. Major short positions, such as Zhengchang, painfully closed their positions, making the surge even more intense. Major players, such as Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhengchang, Hongxing, Yuanmao, Yongda, Dadesheng, Tianfeng, Yongchun, Yuanyong, etc., bought one after another, pushing the price back up to 45 yuan. Although Yuqingyong and retail investors took the opportunity to release their holdings, the price retreated slightly to 2.5 jiao. HSBC's rates were reduced again by 0.125. Yuanmao, Yongda, Dadesheng, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Zhengchang and others bought again, and the noon close rose back to 944.8 yuan. After the close, retail short positions rushed to cover, and major players took the opportunity to buy again. The market was filled with the sound of buying, and Zhengchang also covered its short positions again. Chips were running dry, and the price finally rose to 52.3 yuan.</p>

Hengyu, Yifengyong, Fuan, Yuanmaoyong, Yuqingyong, Yuanyongchun released their holdings, retreating to 49.7 jiao. Although Daxing, Yongshengda bought, but because the Central Bank actually supplied US dollars, Dafa, Yongfuan, Yuanmaoyong, Yuqingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifengyong, Yuanyongchang sold their holdings one after another, and the price dropped to 4 yuan. Dadesheng, Zhengchang, Hengxingsheng, Dadafa Yong took the opportunity to advance to 6.8 jiao at low prices. Fuyu, Qingfayong, Fuxingyong, Yichengyong, Lifu'an, Qianchangxiang, etc. came to sell their holdings again. The Central Bank filled October US dollars at 0.875, and also filled shillings at 0.5 pence, causing people to become timid, and the supply turned strong, dropping to 1.5 yuan. Rumors circulated in the market that the Central Bank would ship silver to adjust the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Dadesheng, Hengchangyong, Hengyu took the opportunity to advance to 4.5 yuan at low prices, but Yuqingyong, Hengxingyuan, Hengyu, etc. sold again, retreating to 2 yuan.

Foreign telegrams predicted that China would abandon silver and use gold, causing the buying momentum to become even stronger. The January US dollar rate of 35.5625 actually proved difficult to settle, and Fuxingyong, Dakang, Hengxingyuan, Hengyu, etc. vigorously bought, pushing the price up to 57 yuan. Maijia Li offered November US dollars at 0.5 yuan, and Hengyu, Yuanyi, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang took the opportunity to supply, gradually falling back to 2.5 yuan.

Yuqingyong, Dadesheng, etc. sold their holdings, and then retreated to 2.5 yuan. After struggling, the closing price was 952.3 yuan. After the close, Fuxingyong, Dadesheng, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, etc. sold their holdings together, and the market sentiment shifted again, likely due to general psychological speculation that the Central Bank was supplying to maintain the market. The price then retreated to 46-47 yuan and finally hovered between 7 and 8 yuan. The highest price of the day was 957 yuan, and the lowest price was 913.5 yuan, with a total fluctuation of 43.5 yuan. As a result, it surged 36.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>

Banks did offer, though not much, because the Central Bank raised the gold rate by one-third, British exchange shrank by 0.25 and US exchange shrank by 0.5 yuan, attracting buying interest from Chinese merchants. The process then tightened, but HSBC revised its rates, raising British exchange by 0.125 and US exchange by 0.25.

Later in the market, it was even tighter, and HSBC revised its British and US rates again (a total shrinkage of 0.5 pence for British and 1 yuan for US).

By the closing price, the selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling 5.3125 pence and the selling price for US exchange was 35.5 yuan.

<p>March Yarn Breaks Through 180 Yuan</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Consistently Breaks Through 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is surging, with a sharp momentum. This situation is beyond expectations.

The short positions see the market as tight and take the opportunity to cover their positions, making the market rise even more fiercely. However, the short positions of Japanese firms have not moved, and the financial sector is taking long positions. March yarn is breaking through the 180 yuan barrier.</p>

Rumors circulating in the market proved to be unfounded, leading to a sudden rebound and a surge in buyers. From morning to noon, prices rose steadily, showing exceptional strength. As the settlement date approached, short sellers grew increasingly impatient. However, due to heavy pressure on the trading floor, the upward momentum did not continue. Considering the overall trend and the bond market situation, the increase should not be limited to this. However, considering the environment, this slight rebound already felt weak. Additionally, a certain firm's eagerness to sell at higher prices acted as a major obstacle for the bond market. Therefore, a comprehensive view suggests that a special development is unlikely. Yesterday, prices rose in almost four consecutive trading sessions, bringing the situation somewhat back on track. However, pressure from a certain firm soon returned, causing the market to weaken again. Overall, the day's price results showed an increase of two, three, or up to five and a half jiao (cents). The total trading volume was 13.39 million, plus 10 shares of stock. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan; stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<h3 id="e231">New York Stock Traders Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market saw sluggish trading and slightly mixed prices. This was due to mixed commercial news, with traders awaiting clarification on monetary conditions and silver prices, adopting a wait-and-see approach. This was caused by China's imposition of an export tax on silver. However, silver stocks rose due to the soaring silver prices. The rise in silver prices was attributed to the belief that the tax would create a shortage of silver in the global market, leading to significant short covering. The bond market was mixed, with strong demand for U.S. government bonds. Stocks on smaller exchanges trended lower. Chicago wheat fell due to weakness in Canadian wheat, which in turn weakened due to large sales from rural areas. The total trading volume was 510,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>October 13th    October 15th    Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks  94.90      94.16      Down 0.74</p>

<h3 id="e232">Grains: Impact of Soaring Gold Prices: Flour and Wheat Surge in the Afternoon <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>▲ Slight Declines Seen in the Morning</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, foreign wheat prices were quoted lower, and various mills rushed to sell, causing the market to decline suddenly. The mills showed a strong intention to sell, totaling no less than 500,000 bags. As a result, market sentiment weakened, and morning closing prices saw a slight drop of two to three cents. However, the imposition of a silver tax led to a reduction in the fineness of foreign gold dollars, causing gold prices to rise. This made foreign wheat less cost-effective. Outside speculators were the first to become bullish, and those covering short positions followed suit with purchases, causing the market to rebound sharply. Major buyers from the Beiyang group and individual investors also made purchases, causing prices for all months to jump by six or seven cents. Compared to the previous day's closing prices, October rose by 2.75 cents, November by 4.5 cents, December by 4.75 cents, January by 3.75 cents, and February by 4 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat market in the morning, major players closed out long positions. With weak demand from current wheat mills, brokers continued to sell on the exchange, causing prices for all months to fall by four or five cents. In the afternoon, the flour market rose, and the reduction in fineness of U.S. gold dollars caused gold prices to rise, making foreign wheat more expensive. As a result, short sellers stopped selling, and long players stopped closing positions, leading to absorption by new buyers both inside and outside the industry. The market then changed suddenly, with prices soaring beyond expectations. Only near-term months were affected by wheat inventories, lacking the sharpness of far-month gains. However, the final closing price for October was still up by two cents, November by one cent, and December and February by four cents each, while January was up by five cents. Current wheat mills held firm, and only three cars of Shandong wheat were offered on the market at a price of 3.45 yuan, which was purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market was initially firm but then faced heavy selling pressure. Additionally, Winnipeg was weak, causing prices to fall. However, conditions in the southwestern producing areas remained dry. Considering the current situation, prices are expected to rise.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Closing Prices October 13th  October 15th  Change</p>
<p>December 100.50  100.00  Down 0.50</p>

<h3 id="e233">Revival of Sesame Seed Sales by Foreign Firms <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>▲ First Batch of New Yingzhou Soybeans Opens at 3.4 Yuan</p>
<p>The sesame seed market has been firm recently, with limited sources and steady demand from various groups. Sales of whole lots by foreign firms have also been active, resulting in good market sentiment. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson purchased 200 tons of white sesame seeds at a price of 7.68 yuan, warehouse delivery, according to old regulations. In addition, sporadic transactions included 200 packages of Mingguang goods at a price of 5.17 yuan and 158 packages of Taizhou goods at a price of 5.2 yuan. The arrival of a large quantity of Jiujiang black sesame seeds led to thin sales, and prices continued to fall by half a yuan. Yesterday, the Ningbo group purchased 21 packages at a price of 7.5 yuan. Both new and old soybeans showed weakness. Demand for old soybeans from factories was inactive, while new soybeans were weakened by the surge in arrivals. The first batch of new Yingzhou soybeans, one carload by Tairun Firm, was priced at 3.4 yuan. The second arrival, three carloads the day before yesterday, saw two carloads priced at 3.37 yuan, while one carload contained over 50 packages of substandard soybeans, priced at only 3.27 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Soar by Two Jiao <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was driven by a sudden increase of over 40 yuan in the gold standard and a rise of one jiao in customs duties, reaching 1.935. This led to a sudden tightening of the trend. The association quoted 18.2 yuan for ordinary spot raw and white sugar, up two jiao from the previous day (14th). Goods in the warehouse and for delivery at the docks were both priced at 18.3 yuan. Re-export goods were priced at 5.3 yuan, up one jiao. High-quality Dutch red sugar was priced at 13.8 yuan, and ordinary at 13.6 yuan. Re-export goods were quoted at 4.8 yuan, a slight increase of one jiao. Locally produced refined white sugar, which had been declining for a long time, also rose by half a jiao on the opportunity of the rebound in raw and white sugar prices, with Zhenyu No. 1 at 16.8 yuan and Zhenji No. 1 quoted at 17 yuan. Domestic green and red sugar prices remained steady, observing the situation as foreign goods rose. If foreign sugar rises further, there is a possibility of following suit.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Speculations and Predictions Regarding "World War" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>Humans living in this era, in this world, are just like sailing boats trying to cross a sea with a rising storm. These sailing boats, of different sizes and ages, are divided into upper and lower classes that are "incompatible like ice and charcoal." Inevitably, internal contradictions arise from their respective interests. What they are crossing is the sea of "history," stirred up by the raging winds of "global economic panic" and the violent waves of "World War II"... Look! What is conspicuously displayed here is a picture and microcosm of this "time" and "space"!</p>
<p>Just like the great human massacre that began in 1914 and lasted for several years, it can give us humans a great lesson. However, less than twenty years after it subsided, all kinds of contradictions and crises are lurking again. Therefore, although the predictions and speculations of general "prophets" and "astrologers" about the timing and location of the "crisis" outbreak are sometimes simply based on no facts, they do indeed indicate the turbulent restlessness of this era and world. Take the so-called "1936 crisis"! More than a year ago, countries were already shouting it to the skies, and people were panicking. Even just the Japanese imperialists, who lit the fuse of the Far East powder keg, have published more than a dozen books on the "1936" problem, as far as I personally have seen. Moreover, Japanese imperialists are using "radio stations" every day to broadcast this "1936" impending disaster to stir up the "patriotic thoughts" of the general lower classes, preparing them to become "human bullets" for the motherland in the future. But looking back at our country, from January to July of this year, the total value of wireless machine imports was more than 1.4 million gold yuan. However, every day they are sending you soul-stirring songs like "Taohuajiang is a Beauty's Nest...", "Sweet Dreams...", "I Don't Want Your Gold, I Only Want Your Heart...", and "×× Opening...", "This Company's New Arrival ×× Goods..." This is enough to show the "national sentiment" of the leisure class.</p>
<p>However, the "1936" crisis is not accidental or without cause. The "global economic panic" after 1928, the "1918" incident, Japan's withdrawal from the "League of Nations," the fruitless "Disarmament Conference," the expiration of the "Naval Treaty" in 1935, etc., are all direct causes and starting points of this "crisis"! Although, the timing will not be so rigid!</p>
<p>Reading yesterday's newspaper, a telegram from New York, someone is predicting a "world war" again. It is said that this is a "person known for his familiarity with the German situation," "and Mr. Steele, who was able to predict Hitler's cleansing movement two weeks in advance." Today, he predicted again that "World War II" will occur next year, and said that the outbreak of war cannot be delayed beyond the summer of 1935, because Germany will no longer be able to pay France under the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, it is necessary to occupy the Saar to reclaim the region's rich coal and iron mines. At that time, Japanese imperialism will take advantage of the chaos in Europe to attack the Soviet Union to maintain its economic hegemony in the Far East.</p>
<p>Originally, today, we all must know: when the "global economic panic" and "international political crisis" have reached their peak, the second great human massacre is bound to descend upon the world! The important thing is: how will we humans, each riding in a crisis-ridden sailing boat, annihilate the "internal contradictions" and follow this historical route to weather the shocking and turbulent storms?</p>

<h3 id="e236">Autumn Harvest <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Chao Ren</p>
<p>A Yuan, why is your rent rice always delayed? Last year was a famine year, and I let you delay it until the end of the year. This year's autumn harvest is not bad. None of the tenant farmers go to the warehouse to pay clearly. Are you planning to delay even longer? Be sensible, and settle it quickly to save us from making extra trips.</p>
<p>Uncle, I'm really sorry for making you come all this way. I'll pour you some tea to moisten your mouth. Please sit down and rest for a while.</p>
<p>Of course I'll sit down. I came all the way for you. Don't be long-winded. Just take the money out. That's taking care of people.</p>
<p>A Yuan poured a cup of steaming strong tea from the teapot, but he was planning in his heart how to deal with the current predicament. Hearing the increasingly urgent urging, his heart also became increasingly panicked. But, looking at his child's yellow face and the empty rice bucket, he still mustered up hope to plead.</p>
<p>I should have come to pay the rent earlier, but this year's harvest was not good either. There was a drought for more than twenty days. You uncle knows that. Although there was some rain afterwards, most of the seedlings had already withered. Fortunately, I still planted in the low-lying fields.</p>
<p>Stop it. There's no need to say more. Anyway, it can't be considered a famine year. If I let you off just by saying a few empty words, then in the future, tenants wouldn't need to prepare silver dollars. They would just need a mouth that can talk.</p>
<p>What you say is true, and sooner or later I have to pay it off, but I really can't scrape it together now. I hope you uncle can help me out by giving me a few more days.</p>
<p>Humph! What kind of times are these? All the deadlines have passed. You simply want to eat rent rice. To put it bluntly, eating rent rice is against the law. There's nothing else to say. Hurry up and take the money out, or else I won't have anything to tell Li Zhonglao when I go back, and I won't be able to be lenient. Zhonglao's business card is already here. I'll take you to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>A Yuan was extremely panicked at this time. He knew Li's landlord's power. Many tenants had been sent to the Public Security Bureau for owing rent, but he didn't have a single penny. What could he do? Worrying wouldn't help. His heart suddenly relaxed. Anyway, he couldn't escape his fate. He would stand up and go with the rent collector.</p>
<p>Okay, so be it if I get sued. I really can't squeeze out any money. It's fine if you uncle takes me to the city.</p>
<p>The cunning rent collector didn't expect him to finally become tough. It was a pity that all his threats were in vain. Although sending a tenant who owes rent to the authorities was very reasonable, he also understood A Yuan's predicament. Empty threats couldn't squeeze out any money. It was better to give him a few more days to raise the money. Just for the sake of dignity, he couldn't directly soften his tone.</p>
<p>You make it sound easy. Lawsuits aren't easy to handle. Who will take care of your family if you go to jail? I think you should think of another way.</p>
<p>Who wants to go to jail? Alas, since you uncle is looking after me, I wonder if you can give me a few more days.</p>
<p>You have to understand that we also used other people's money and can't help but do this. We don't like to make enemies with people. Since that's the case, forcing you won't get me any money. Now I'm specially giving you three more days. If I don't get an explanation after three days, then I'll have to be impolite.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I will definitely try my best to find a way in three days.</p>
<p>Remember, if you don't pay the money after three days, I'll really have to deal with you.</p>
<p>These were the words the rent collector said as he left, as if to show the seriousness of his business. A Yuan was worried in his heart: what explanation would he have if he didn't have any money after three days? He looked at the rice bucket and could only sigh.</p>
<p>Three days will pass very quickly, he looked at his son's yellow face.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Late Autumn Night's Note <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>The night has deepened, and the alley is as silent as stagnant water. There are no sounds of vendors selling snacks, and the children living together are all quietly lying in bed, enjoying their sweet dreams. At this moment, I am sitting facing the yellow light, propping up my thin chin, thinking about the topic of the article.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Calligraphy by Mr. Xu Cihua <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>

<p>Autumn Day of Jiaxu [Year]</p>
<p>Xu Cihua</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sharp gust of cold wind whistled in through the window, icy cold. Through the extremely thin pajamas, it made me shiver a few times. Thus, I deeply felt that autumn had deepened.</p>
<p>Autumn may be considered by people to be an extremely beautiful and poetic season! Fat crabs, slender chrysanthemums, half a catty of yellow wine, drinking alone in front of the moon. When I am tipsy, I stand up and sing at the top of my lungs, forgetting heaven and earth and forgetting myself, living a semi-hermitic life. If, in the quiet of the night, I wake up from a new dream and listen to the sparse rain tapping on the remaining lotus leaves, the so-called "keeping the remaining lotus to listen to the sound of rain," how much does this scene and feeling suit the tastes of poets? Then, it is not impossible to temporarily be a poet.</p>
<p>Autumn is truly a beautiful and extremely poetic season!</p>
<p>Every morning, I sit up from bed and flip through the newly delivered newspapers. The most eye-catching things are the autumn sales advertisements of major companies and the forest of tempting, excellent films in the movie theaters. Indeed, this autumn season is much better than the scorching summer. It is so comfortable to sit on a soft cotton sofa! At the same time, I no longer smell that kind of nauseating, salty and sour sweaty smell. Especially those coquettish and graceful women seem even more graceful and lovely in this clear and refreshing autumn.</p>
<p>However, these are the comforts and joys that only a very small number of people can get from autumn. Under the double pressure of natural and man-made disasters, the autumn harvest that farmers have been looking forward to has been abandoned. Watching their old home丨the countryside丨go bankrupt faster and faster day by day, even the problem of eating has caused panic, what leisure do they have to appreciate this beautiful and poetic autumn like those poets who have nothing to do after eating their fill! Moreover, the weather is getting colder day by day. Aren't all their winter clothes for keeping out the cold sent to the pawnshop? But, the autumn harvest is already hopeless. What ability do they have to get those winter clothes for keeping out the cold from the pawnshop? Thinking of the harsh winter, these poor people began to worry about the cool autumn that was quietly descending on the world.</p>
<p>Terrifying autumn! Perhaps you are the executioner who controls the fate of the poor.</p>
<p>Vaguely, I seem to hear those homeless poor people, on the streets in the middle of the night, soaking in the rustling autumn wind, constantly shivering, and sighing quietly...</p>
<p>"These are all unfortunate people adrift in the world! After a deep breath, a sigh of sympathy.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am a resident of Wuyuan County in Anhui Province. I have a difficult matter that I have been contemplating for months without a resolution. Therefore, I am compelled to seek your assistance in finding a solution.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when a younger relative of mine was getting married, I was asked to borrow several hundred yuan from various sources on his behalf. The loan agreement stipulated that the principal and interest would be repaid when the fir trees in the countryside were sold. According to the calculations at that time, the timber price would have been more than sufficient to cover the debt. However, due to the recent rural economic downturn and financial ruin, timber merchants who transport wood to Zhejiang and Hangzhou have reduced the timber prices due to a lack of sales channels. Recently, there has been almost no demand. As a result, the agreement to settle the debt with timber prices cannot be fulfilled, and the interest is increasing daily. If I declare bankruptcy, there are no lawyers in the countryside to handle the liquidation, and self-assessment and distribution are not permitted by the creditors. This situation is quite perplexing. I earnestly request your assistance in finding a solution. With respectful greetings.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Xin Jiu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: According to the letter, Mr. Xin Jiu does not seem to be the guarantor, and therefore has no legal responsibility. However, since the matter was handled previously, it is morally appropriate to help resolve it.</p>
<p>The first step is to investigate whether there is any possibility of the mortgaged property increasing in value. At the same time, convene all creditors for sincere consultation. If there is no chance of the mortgaged property increasing in value and the loan is due, the mortgaged property must first be sold. The amount not covered should then be negotiated for a repayment schedule, and the debtor should find a way to raise the funds.</p>

<h3 id="e244">New Trends in 1935 Model Cars <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Min</p>
<p>The 1934 model cars, at first glance, seem perfect in terms of structure, appearance, and performance. However, after careful study by engineers from various countries, many shortcomings were discovered, such as the lack of a standard format for vehicles and the outdated ventilation in the cabins. Everything awaited improvement by engineers. Now, the newly born 1935 model cars have advantages that exceed our expectations, far surpassing the old 1934 models. The first reason why the 1935 model cars have achieved such success and are considered ideal vehicles is, of course, due to the reduction of automobile taxes by the governments of various countries (England, America, France) (a 20% reduction). This light tax change is enough to increase the purchasing power of small horsepower car owners. For example, those who originally bought 14 horsepower cars can now buy 18 or 20 horsepower cars. This change in horsepower directly provides car factories with more advanced designs and manufacturing, allowing engineers to conduct deeper research and produce excellent car engines. This is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>The price increase is directly proportional to the cost of raw materials. In recent years, the prices of various raw materials have been rising sharply, so the price of the 1935 model cars will be at least a little more expensive than the old cars. This is also unavoidable.</p>
<p>In the 1934 model cars, we can see various different and strange-looking cars, such as rocket-shaped and olive-shaped cars. However, this phenomenon will absolutely not be found in the 1935 model cars, because engineers agree that these strange-shaped vehicles are an expression of car factories showing off to their peers. As a result, the construction of the engine and body is often perfunctory, failing to achieve excellent results. Therefore, the 1935 model cars belong to the condition of "standardization." Factories are striving for the precision and solidity of the body construction, abandoning external competition.</p>
<p>Independent spring suspension was slightly adopted in the 1934 model cars, but there was no standard, and no complete testing was conducted. The results were naturally inferior. The 1935 model cars are different. Even small springs have undergone static and dynamic testing. The vibration amplitude after the engine starts is reduced to a minimum. The front and rear axle supports are equipped with vibration-absorbing interlayer rubber springs. Even when driving on rough roads, the cabin does not experience severe jolting.</p>
<p>The connection of the car cabin has been studied by many engineers in recent years, and satisfactory results have finally been achieved. The 1935 model cars have all adopted it. The car windows are made of two layers of glass. The inner layer can be raised and lowered freely, and the outer layer is equipped with a pivot, which can be pushed outwards to any angle. In this way, air circulation is completely around the car cabin, greatly reducing resistance and air pressure.</p>
<p>The length of the new cars is about 20% greater than the old cars, and the width is about 10% greater. The degree of streamlining is roughly similar to the old cars, but it is more even.</p>
<p>Although the increase in tire cross-section was blindly opposed by many engineers in the past, it has now been a great success. The total tire air volume of the 1935 model cars is 5-7% higher than the old cars, thus increasing the load by 23-30%. These results are quite astonishing.</p>
<p>The connection of the rotating parts of this car all use the latest roller system. The frictional force of the metal area is naturally reduced. Each shaft part has an automatic lubricator to inject lubricating oil. When there is excess lubricating oil, it can flow back to the central lubrication system at an extremely fast rate, with absolutely no leakage or other losses. The braking of the engine utilizes the latest electromagnetic coil induction. Any external temperature has no effect. The control of voltage and the distribution of electricity are managed by precision machinery. Therefore, the ability and efficiency of the electric motor are exceptionally high. This is also a feature of the 1935 model cars.</p>
<p>In short, although the price of the new cars is slightly higher, the reduction in car tax excites the car factories to manufacture, so there are such achievements. These "standardized" new cars will soon be sold in the car market and warmly welcomed by the general public. This is undoubtedly true.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Road Safety Issues <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Advice from Experts</p>
<p>Mr. Jings, a famous skilled car driver, holds the American Automobile Association records for various competitions regarding distance, speed, and endurance. The number of records he has created is so large that other drivers can only look on in amazement, with no one able to match him. What is even more commendable is that, although he has repeatedly set the highest records, he has never caused an accident. Recently, he provided six points of advice regarding road safety issues, which were published in the newly published Rotary magazine. I have translated them below for the reference of those who are concerned about car driving safety.</p>
<p>(1) Always Manage the Steering Wheel with Both Hands: As far as I know, there are skilled drivers who use one hand, but it is better to manage the steering wheel with both hands.</p>
<p>(2) Fit the Best Tires on the Front Wheels: Front tire blowouts are more dangerous. If a blowout unfortunately occurs, only by firmly gripping the steering wheel can danger be avoided.</p>
<p>(3) Always Check the Brakes: After I start driving, I always step on the foot pedal within the first 100 yards to check the brakes, because the brakes may be frozen, sticky, or in need of adjustment.</p>
<p>(4) Drive Even More Carefully When the Sky is Dim: When driving fast at dawn or dusk, the possibility of causing an accident will be many times greater than in the morning or daytime. The reason for this is, of course, due to unclear visibility. We must also remember that fatal car crash cases increase by 42% at night compared to daytime.</p>
<p>(5) It is not necessary to use the brakes when coasting.</p>
<p>(6) Always Pay Attention to Road Conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e246">The Progress of Dodge Cars in the Last Twenty Years <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Dodge factory, as we all know, has a very long history in the automotive industry. 1934 marks the 20th anniversary of the Dodge factory. In the past twenty years, the Dodge factory has made significant progress. And now, Dodge's products are renowned in the automotive industry. The position it occupies in the automotive industry is getting higher and higher day by day. Today, it is qualified to be a leader. The only reason why Dodge has such a position today is the stability of the factory's business policies and the excellence of its products. Therefore, the history of the Dodge factory for twenty years is the entire history of the development of Dodge cars.</p>
<p>The superiority of the Dodge six-cylinder car is the result of efforts to improve it over the past twenty years. And "buoyancy" is a special achievement among various inventions and improvements. The Dodge car body is made entirely of single-piece pure steel. Therefore, the general public has recognized the Dodge car body as one of the safest car bodies. Safety glass provides drivers and passengers with great safety. And in this year's new cars, the most significant reform is the independent suspension of the front wheels. With the device of independent suspension, the vehicle can avoid all tilting and backward shaking force when driving on the road. As a result, it can give any car owner unexpected safety and speed.</p>
<p>In terms of ventilation, the invention and adoption of a new type of windless ventilation system is more advanced than any ventilation system ever used on Dodge cars. With this new device, the windows can be completely lowered, including the ventilation part and independent ventilation. The engine on the six-cylinder Dodge car, operated by a crank on the dashboard, is huge and powerful, and very glossy. Now, a seven-point weighted crank rod is used. Just these points can make us feel that Dodge's new cars have made significant progress in form and mechanism.</p>
<p>The streamline of the 1934 Dodge six-cylinder car is not only long and low, but also very balanced. The padding and decoration, everything, is beautiful and modern. The style is very good, whether inside or outside the car. In terms of structure, the car body is made of single-piece pure steel, so it is like a steel boat hull, using the welding method, so there are no cracks at the seams, so it is safe and strong. It is unmatched by the car bodies of any new cars. Steel inside and steel outside is the most solid kind of vehicle in the 1934 new cars.</p>
<p>In addition to passenger cars, the Dodge factory is also famous for manufacturing trucks. This is also well known. The Dodge factory has also been manufacturing trucks for eighteen years. In the process of manufacturing trucks, the Dodge factory has always considered the industrial sector, so that they can save money by purchasing Dodge trucks. With rich experience, until now, everyone has recognized that the products can indeed surpass their material excellence and engineering convenience. The manufacturing technology is very skillful and exquisite. All equipment is also readily available. Therefore, after the industrial sector adopts Dodge freight trucks, we can guarantee that their expenses will definitely be reduced a lot, because the transportation is fast and easy. Whether in terms of fuel, maintenance costs, or the original investment, it will feel very economical.</p>

<p>After the first two batches of the Little Citroen new cars arrived in Shanghai, they were sold out in no time. Because the style of the new cars is extremely small and exquisite, and the entire construction is extremely solid, excellent, and sophisticated, all small car enthusiasts are scrambling to buy them. The local distributor, the French Da Automobile Company, in order to meet the needs of customers, repeatedly telegraphed the factory to rush the shipment. Now, the third batch of new cars has arrived in large quantities. Dark blue, purple red, light gray, and other body colors are available. The colors are bright and exceptionally pleasing to the eye. In recent days, many people have been going to the company to visit and test drive the cars.</p>

<h3 id="e250">French Highway Construction <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Shelley</p>
<p>Building Five New Automobile Roads</p>
<p>Recently, the French government prepared to take 10,000,000,000 francs for road improvement expenses. The method of allocating all of this huge expense has also been decided. Half of this funding is used to build new road networks that connect to the outside of Paris and for road construction in the Paris area. The other half is used to improve highways throughout France, and the most important thing is to eliminate level crossings everywhere.</p>
<p>It seems like a large expense to use half of the total funding for the construction and improvement of roads in Paris. However, we must know that in France, the important highways, needless to say, are in very good condition on most of the secondary roads. Therefore, apart from the special goals mentioned, there is actually no need for huge expenditures to repair and improve the roads. Because the situation in Paris is completely the opposite of what has been mentioned earlier, urgent repairs and improvements are very important. The traffic congestion on the main roads leading to the capital of Paris has reached its peak in recent years. This summer, if it is a Saturday or Sunday, the congestion on the roads often extends for many miles. The traffic obstruction can be imagined. The plan to improve roads in Paris includes the construction of five major automobile roads spreading out from the city center and connecting with the ring roads in the suburbs. It is reported that the construction of three of the five highways will start soon.</p>
<p>The three major roads mentioned above are the Great Western Road, the Great Southern Road, and the Northern Road. Because Paris is geographically the intersection of continental air routes, the Northern Road leads directly to the Bourget Airport. The starting point of the Southern Road will be between the existing roads to Arpajon and Fontainebleau. Vehicle traffic is currently very congested on these two roads. The Arpajon Road mentioned above leads directly to Orléans and Bordeaux. The Fontainebleau line goes directly to Lyon and southern France.</p>
<p>Whether it is day or night, vehicle traffic is very congested on the roads mentioned above. However, the situation is even more complicated near Paris, because most of the suburban vehicle traffic consists of cargo vehicles. Doesn't this make vehicle traffic even more troublesome? If the newly opened roads are completed, then the aforementioned traffic congestion difficulties will not be difficult to resolve, because the plan is to extend the new roads 20 miles outside of Paris and then connect them with the existing roads.</p>
<p>The new Western Road will start in Husine. You can reach the bridge from Bronchi and connect with the Le Portes Cardi road, extending directly to western France. It also connects with the Pondorsdiperes Road. In addition to the two roads above, the third major road is shorter but very important. This road will extend from Bobigny to connect Paris with the Northern (Chantilly) Road. In this way, we will have the fastest ground transportation between Paris and the various important airports.</p>
<p>In addition to the new spider web network, there are many road construction projects related to Paris itself and its suburbs that are also being planned. There are still many level crossings in the suburbs, which will soon be eliminated. The Seine Bridge will be widened. The traffic congestion caused by the fall of the old fortress line will be resolved.</p>
<p>Because the fall of the Port of Delphi has been significantly successful, the municipal authorities have now begun to add other tunnels, such as the tunnels of Meroude and Jinbailai, which are already known. The completion of these is not far away. It is expected that one or two of the tunnels will be fully completed next year. At the same time, the problem of traffic congestion will be solved along with it. Vehicle traffic from Meroude in and out of Paris has always been very complex, especially on weekends, which is even more difficult to solve.</p>
<p>A new tunnel at Fanlitot Port has been under construction for a long time and will definitely be</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>completed and opened this year. In this way, ground traffic to Bobigny Airport can be diverted. There are also two tunnels of the same nature under construction, one in Italy and one in Crete. These two places have always been concentrated points of traffic congestion. However, there is still a tunnel being planned, which will be built under the Seine beach at Carrousel Port.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to use tunnels to solve the difficulty of complex traffic, not only in the city but also in the suburbs. The idea is to use tunnels to eliminate level crossings in the suburbs, and the traffic underneath is railway traffic rather than road traffic. The intersections of Bushkolombers and Akishi are two good examples. There used to be three level crossings in that area within 100 yards. After passing through one gate, car drivers would continuously face the second gate in the short lane. The first gate had closed behind the car, as if it were a cow or a sheep, closed in a fence. It would take at least twenty-five minutes, or even longer, to pass through.</p>
<p>The municipal engineering of France is very developed. Therefore, the improvements to the difficulties and complexities mentioned above can be effectively demonstrated.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Talking About Changes in Automobile Styles <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongqin</p>
<p>Automobiles have recently been regarded not only as a means of transportation, but also as a beautiful and magnificent object. Because automobiles are regarded as a beautiful and magnificent object, general automobile dealers are doing their best to improve the beauty of the appearance, and the beauty of the appearance is the issue of automobile style. This is probably one of the most important things about automobiles today. If a car buyer notices the style of the car first when buying a car,</p>
<p>If he is an automobile manufacturing expert, in his words, he can often hear things like the 1930 style, the 1933 style, or the 1934 style. It can be seen that style is the most important condition for automobiles today. Automobile styles change every year, with new developments every day and month. Therefore, general automobile manufacturers are doing their best to seek improvements. This improvement has caused a trend of change in automobile styles, gradually changing from one style to another.</p>
<p>If we are talking about large cars, then there are styles of large cars. Because the world today is a world of economic panic, all trends are heading towards the economic side. Therefore, automobiles have to tend towards economy. For example, Austin automobiles, originally famous for small cars, are carrying out their reform policy during this period, making small cars active on the market. Star cars also launched fresh small cars at the same time. Ford cars also have new styles of small cars appearing on the market. Other Niu, Hillman, Nash and other cars also have the latest styles of small cars. It can be seen that this is a general trend. All automobile manufacturing industries are affected by this trend during this period.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the general changes in automobile styles, that applies to both large and small cars. Ten years ago, the style of automobiles was to advocate high car bodies and shorter lengths. At that time, all automobiles were very expensive. Because the car body was high, the chassis below was also raised accordingly. The corners of the car body were angular, because at that time, the idea was to make the square corner beautiful, so all the roof corners were square. Such a car was very fashionable at that time. Of course, this same car cannot be found in any automobile factory now, and if there is such a vehicle on the market, it must be considered very ugly. However, ten years ago, this style was considered the most beautiful among automobiles. A few can still be found, like old Lincoln cars and Packard cars, which are still very solid, but the car body style is very old. It is still visible on the market. Although the style is very ugly, the value of this car is very expensive.</p>
