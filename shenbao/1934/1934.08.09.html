<p>時評</p>
<h3>絲業的救急辦法彤</h3>
<p>近來上海各絲廠。甫經開工。便遭絲價慘跌的影響。以致有不能續開之勢。在棉織業的緊急關頭。全市又閙着絲業的恐慌。眞是我國實業界的多事之秋了。就廠家方面說。絲廠開工的標準。須完全以絲價市面爲轉移。但按照實際。最近絲價的狂跌。實爲空前所未有。在穩定的辦法實現以前。絲廠停工。勢所難免。至於勞工的生計安定。乃完全處於被動的地位。其身受的痛苦當然更爲深厚。在今年絲廠重行開工的時候。市當局眼見就業工人不過往年十之一二。工人們不免有爭奪工作的事情發生。所以爲維持治安及救濟工人着想。曾具呈中央。請予設法。政府方面。關於治本方面的。曾擬定挽救江浙蠶絲業根本辦法十一條。關於救急方面的亦有救濟本市絲業辦法四條。亦可見其注意於絲業前途之一班了。</p>
<p>這幾年來。我國絲業的崩潰。已無容諱言。其間的原因何在。值得我們的檢討。有些人將絲業衰敗歸咎於銀錢業投資方針的錯誤。說經營公債和地産。就是妨礙實業進步漠視農村經濟的主要原因。這就未免忽略華絲技術方面的退步。世界的不景氣。和日本人的傾銷政策了。我們知道國絲的出口額。已由一九二八年二萬八千二百萬元。降至一九三三年的九千三百萬元。計慘落百分之六十七。可是同時期内。天然絲在世界市塲上的銷路。並没有同比例的降落。這就完全證明國内絲業的迅速崩潰。頗受其他産絲國生産力擴張。尤其是日絲傾鎖的影響。在目前世界經濟恐慌聲中。生産力進步的國家。竭力企圖世界市塲的獨佔。品質不如人的華絲。當然只有失敗的份兒。　　本來我國是一個半殖民地國家。國内整個的實業界。根本就受着帝國主義勢力的控制。絲業的現狀。不過其中之一例。但因絲業向爲國民的主要生産事業。它的崩潰可以發生多方面的影響。第一。絲業的衰敗。必然要使無數的農民的生活更趨於悲慘。因爲絲業不振。繭價便不值錢。繭價愈趨跌落。則農民收入亦便更加收縮。生活水準也便更加降低了。在這樣「死亡無日」的狀態下。改良生産問題。亦自然無從談起了。其次。農民生活固然日趨於悲慘的地步。而藉絲廠爲生的大批工人。亦便發生絶大的恐慌。卽如上海一　埠共有絲廠工人八萬人之多。目前就業工人。旣然不及往年十分之一二。其餘六七萬工人和其家屬只好束手待斃。再次就國家財政而。論江浙一帶。向爲中央財政之策源地。而蠶絲業又爲江浙農民的大宗收入。一旦江浙最大多數的農民生計大受打擊。要他們繼續負荷國家的捐稅。便不免發生困難了。</p>
<p>絲業恐慌影響於國計民生者。旣是這樣的重大。當然不可不亟謀救濟。我們認爲目前情形緊急。好高鶩遠的辦法。不如暫且不提。政府前定救急的辦法中的第三項「從速成立絲業統制委員會。」縱能卽日成立。亦須一筆三四千萬元的鉅欵。才能相當發揮統制的效能。所以一時難得實現。至於第一項「豁免地方一切蠶繭及廠絲捐稅」和第二項「减輕桑苗及絲繭運費。」充其量亦不過是消極的補救。看來救力不至於十分的偉大。最重要的還是第四項「由上海市政府先行借欵及籌劃的欵或發行公債予以救濟」的辦法。查江浙兩省政府及實業財政兩部。曾爲救濟絲業而發行民國二十年度江浙絲業公債及民國二十一年江浙絲業短期公債。并曾設立江浙陳絲陳繭登記及推銷兩委員會。都有相當的成績。不過政府方面因發行絲業公債。已蒙重大的負擔。此次上海市政府以至中央政府有無勇氣在最短期間負責爲各絲廠績發公債。實在是個疑問。至於先行借欵及籌劃的欵。更非容易。據絲業界的意見。現在唯一的救急辦法。應請政府照十九年份所頒救濟絲業先例。凡每擔生絲出口由政府補助洋一百元。或請政府指定銀行輕利受押。使經濟靈通。這是比較上輕而易舉的辦法。希望政府能勉副該業期望。先把當前的難關渡過。失業工人的生計亦顧全了。然後再趕緊謀貿易。生産。及原料價格等的統制。國際市塲的推銷和絲業技術的改良。</p>

<p>江潮高漲馬路低窪處均積水</p>
<p>普通建築略受損害航輪恢復</p>
<p>近數日内向滬埠進撲之颶風、已於昨晨過滬、續向西北西進行、仍在海中、昨晨十時、颶風進至距滬八十哩左右之大戢山東面、據徐家匯天文臺所接大戢山氣象臺報告、八日晨六時至九時、北風降臨、達十個風力、此種風力、爲内地所罕遭、力能拔木、及釀其他損毁、十個風力之速率、每小時可達五十三至六十三哩、昨晨颶風進抵滬埠附近時、浦江波濤狂湧、江上全無船隻駛行、幸未進抵本埠、故至午後、風勢漸殺、而熱浪則已大减、昨日氣温最高度僅八十一度半、較星期一日（九九·七）相差幾達二十度、</p>
<p>掠滬而過</p>
<p>此次兩颶風因在太平洋合併、故其風力甚大、計有十個風力之多、天文臺於昨日上午十時、報告颶風主力已到上海東部口外北緯三十一度、東經一百二十三度之大戢山、風力達十個之鉅、風行速率、爲每秒鐘二十七公尺、每小時行九十七公里、方向爲北北西或北、至十一時、方向爲北北偏西、故僅有颶風之左翼掠滬而過、共有六個風力、該臺復於昨日下午二時報告、颶風左翼已過滬、其主力在北緯三十二度東經一百二十四度、方向爲北北東、横渡黃海、向高麗方面吹去、</p>
<p>潮水高漲</p>
<p>颶風於昨午掠滬東而過後、係在海洋中吹襲、幸未登陸、故本市及内地一帶未罹風災、但沿海一帶當略受其害、本市浦江、因海水被風吹襲、倒灌而入、致江水高漲、昨晨五時許、外灘及北四川路一帶、因江水上漲、積水逹三數寸、但旋卽退去、</p>

<p>損害一斑</p>
<p>昨日颶風主力雖未達本市、而其左翼掠過時、因六個風力、故風勢仍形猛强、致滬東區各普通建築物、多有損壞、而尤以吳淞·眞茹·江灣·閘北·及越界築路等處之電話綫、大都均被風吹斷、不能通話、旋由電話避派員分頭前往各處修理、迄至下午、始全部修復、間亦有電桿樹木被拔者、而各馬路商店被毁招牌、亦不在少數、</p>

<p>蔣氏首稱、滬市米價高漲之原因、（一）爲蕪湖禁止米糧出口、（二）湖南增加糧食出省稅、（三）各地旱災加重、（四）粉麥市價高漲、（五）行營採購秈米二萬石、現尚仍在購買、因此五故、致來源减少、銷路見增、羣投機居奇、雖市上定價明爲十三元、而暗盤已開至十三元七角、本月又爲青黃不接之時、故漲風正方興未艾、</p>
<p>洋米將到</p>
<p>繼又稱、至於銀錢業與米業、向西貢訂購洋米、總數銀錢業爲十五萬石、米業爲二十萬石、本月内可到十萬石、其餘均於下月可進口、現本市西貢售價十二元、銀米兩業首批訂購成本爲十元三角、二批爲十一元四角、故二批已無利可沾、聞銀錢業之米、將屯積以期價漲、同里粳已售十二元四角、本年同里米原較常帮（即頭號白米）少四元、故現市頭號白米售十三元、尚屬抑制、設照情理、須售十六元矣、</p>
<p>本市存米</p>
<p>末又稱、本市存米頭號白米共存三十萬石、四家米廠存一萬包、恊記公司存八千包、以上均爲秈粳糯米、合市斛四十餘萬石、惟此項糧食、均不適外埠應用、以全市日消萬五千石計、尚可維持一月、新垃圾橋杉板廠新橋間各洋棧内、尚有押欵米十萬石、浦東各洋棧尚存湖南秈江西币安徽秈西貢秈及三年前之小絞米、總數亦在十萬石以上、欲米價平定、須待洋米來滬後、方可回縮云、</p>

<h3>昨招待新聞界</h3>
<p>報告與車商商定辦法各點</p>
<p>新聲社云、公共租界人力車糾紛解决後、工部局人力車管理委員會、昨日下午三時、招待各報社新聞記者、解釋實行新章後、予車主車夫以福利、主席麥西並否認有消極意、同時公告新陳請人、聲明並無餘額、兹分誌各情於下、</p>
<p>麥西報告</p>
<p>人力車管理委員會主席麥西、昨日下午三時、在江西路工部局會所、接見記者、由朱懋登翻譯云、本人對於人力　　車新車、前日雙方商定之辦法、甚覺滿意、本會所負使命、爲免除車夫痛苦、爲社會謀福利、並無其他用意存在、至報載本人不能行其個人主張、表示消極之說、本人根本無此意、亦無辭職理由云、（新聲社按麥西消極說、係車商方面傳出、謂星期一工部局開對等會議時、麥氏有此表示云、）</p>
<p>互助救濟</p>
<p>關於互助救濟會設有理事會、計理事十人、内外人四名、華人六名、領照之車主及登記之車夫、各派代表二人、監視經費之運用、以後是否添聘、須視情形而定、此種救濟車夫互助費、車主方面、亦已明瞭甚望各方合作、車夫互助、是自已帮助自已、並非慈善事業、此點外界頗多誤會、登記之車夫、如遇疾病或不測、得向互助救濟會請求救濟、非眞正領照車夫、不得享受此種權利、</p>
<p>登記車主</p>
<p>至新章之實行、據報載工部局接受車主條件之說、完全誤解、工部局並未放棄改良車樣及各項原則、因車照之出租買賣抵押、與新章舊章、完全抵觸、領照會一紙、以價值七十元之車一輛、可出賣至七百元、藉此不勞而獲者、皆係車夫作牛馬爲之造成、故新章之規定、非眞正車主、不能領執照、現爲免除弊竇起見、、放寛時期、展期至十三日爲止、非有領執照之證據、不能領取、使車主得有實益、至改革車輛、有關係者、如有疑問或意見、可儘量供獻本委員會、本委員會絶不存一毫偏見、</p>
<p>車租標準</p>
<p>新章自雙方會議解决後、車租每日收大洋七角八分、加以互助救濟費七分、此外每月並由車主每月繳付互助救濟費一元五角、車夫方面、尚有向工部局車委會表示、每日車夫仍溢出小洋十一角、要求减低者、因洋價之漲落無定、應車主之請求、定爲此數、去年研究會所定小洋十角、折合大洋爲七角八分、故爲彼此兩不吃虧計、定爲大洋、至車夫登記四萬人、外界不明、謂拉車者有十餘萬人、此去彼來、决不敷用、皆係誤會、倘車夫因事返鄕、領照之車夫、如不敷分配、可隨時向車委會領照、可毋庸顧慮也、</p>
<p>新車式樣</p>
<p>至於改良新車式樣、現各方繳來新樣七分、在車務處檢查、以經濟堅固美觀爲標準、大約二週内卽可决定、至外傳新車樣核定後、全市車輛、皆須改換、此則實係誤會、現有車輛、經過二個月、必須向工部角車務處檢騐、如檢查時發現有陳舊不堪、車身不固者、卽須淘汰、改換新車、倘全市完全改換、必須經過數年、方能一律、故車主方面、不必視爲難題也、</p>

<p>人力車業同業公會、以各項問題、業經圓滿解决、爲使各會員車主早日領取執照起見、前昨兩日、題辦發還各車主繳存之工部局申請書下聯事宜、頗形忙碌、已領到下聯之車主、業於昨晨携取該項下聯、詣車委會換取車主證書後、復至捐務處車務處納捐、領取八月份營業執照、該同業公會並派代表數人、前往車委會、恊助辦理發給新證、</p>
<p>新車商淘汰</p>
<p>工部局人力車務委員會、前曾招請公衆願遵章領用公用人力車執照者、可呈遞陳請書、以備執照有餘額時、可以分配給發、一時陳請者甚衆、刻因舊車主方面、已願遵照局章辦理、而工部局亦將給發車主證書之限期予以延展、俾可照辦、故車照一項、恐已難有餘額給與新陳請人、車委會刻已將此情形、公告陳請人知照矣、</p>

<p>雅片氣味</p>
<p>北平開之第四零一次滬平貨車、於前午經過津浦鐵路浦口站時、護路憲兵巡查至第四五二八○號四十噸車一輛時、有雅片氣味透出、當要求站長開門檢查、該站以聯運貨物、中途不得檢查、及駛至首都、由憲兵在該輛加「憲兵司令部派駐京滬滬杭甬兩路護車憲兵隊於七月七日謹封」封條、查七月實係八月之誤、</p>

<p>李石林痛妻産後病死</p>
<h3>訴婦醫院院長醫生</h3>
<p>第二特院昨日開審醫界紛往旁聽</p>
<p>李陳述其妻入院及得病慘死甚詳</p>
<p>丨庭諭候傳訊陳景煦醫生再訊丨</p>
<p>寓居法租界霞飛路尚賢坊三十四號門牌在北京路開設東華工程建築公司主本地人李石林、今年四十歲、其妻王氏、年約三十五六歲、夫婦情感彌篤、已生子女六個、近又懷孕、爲第七生産、至本年六月二十九日孕期足月、清晨腹中覺痛臨産、李即將氏送至尚賢坊後面薩坡賽路一號尚賢堂婦孺産科醫院待産、當日上午十時、産生一子、由醫師葛成慧接生、産時母子平安、不料三日之後、産婦忽然變病、熱度高升至百度以上、李因留院無適當醫治、故將氏接歸、自行延醫</p>
<p>治療無效</p>
<p>於七月十二日身死、李石林以妻之變病致死、實緣該醫院漠視病人、玩忽職務、不爲醫療所致、心難折服、爰延嚴蔭武·陸聰祖·兩律師代理、具狀第二特區地方法院、依據刑法二九一條、自訴尚賢堂婦孺醫院院長張湘紋·醫生葛成慧·看護長顧琴月·等玩忽業務致人於死、請求傳訊、依法治罪等情、法院據狀、於昨日上午、由刑庭長王綱煦特開刑二庭、傳集兩造審理、自訴人偕嚴·陸兩律師到院、被告等亦偕辯護人譚毅公律師到案、傍聽席上</p>
<p>多屬女性</p>
<p>猶以醫界居多數、開庭後、法官先訊兩造年齡·籍貫·職業·住址·後、據自訴人李石林聲訴自訴意旨事實云、我妻王氏、因懷孕足月、於本年六月二十九日清晨、覺得腹痛、我即伴送至尚賢堂婦孺産科醫院、住頭等房間待産、由葛成慧醫生接生、於同日上午十點零五分、生一男孩、産婦以前平安生産六次、皆依舊欲請穩婆收生、此次送往醫院生産、尤爲瓜熟蒂落、毫無阻礙、亦無病象、産後亦甚平安、至六月三十日、不知何故、該院院長張湘紋請一黃姓醫生代行診察、七月一日、産婦身體忽發熱、照理醫生對産婦</p>
<p>身體發熱</p>
<p>應愼重細心檢查其致熱原因、妥爲醫治、乃被告等均不注　、僅謂係乳漲、祇須少飲開水、少吃粥、熱度即能减退並不予以適當醫治、致翌日熱度更高、其時産婦畏寒頗甚、心覺不安、自向醫生索閱寒熱表、而該院竟不予閱看、祇云略有熱度、並無妨碍、只要靜臥三日、下午我去探望自帶有量熱器、突見産婦熱勢高至華氏一零四度·二、室内臭氣難聞、我失聲大驚、回顧室内、並無看護之人、急撳電鈴、呼看護生來、囑其請醫生來診察、詎知久候無人入室、我遂自赴該院二樓看護室、則看護長與看護</p>
<p>竟無一人</p>
<p>在内、足見該醫院之忽視病人、無以復加、至七月四日下午、我自請陳景煦醫師前往診視、一入病室、即覺奇臭難聞、陳醫師即謂恐係産褥熱病、迨加細視、産婦身體、尸發現紅白瘖子、熱度高至一零四度·八、果係産褥熱病、係因産時施用手術不盡、消毒與産後看護洗滌不愼所致、我知病勢危急、留院無益、决定遷回家内、另行延醫治療、乃該醫院竟迫令在印就之自願出院書單子上簽字、可恨尤極、至産婦抬回家中、延陳醫師與刁信德醫師兩人診察、皆認定是</p>
<p>産褥熱病</p>
<p>即打針治療、終難挽救、至七月十二日夜半二點三十分時身死、産婦在臨死前、極口呼寃、謂生命全喪醫院之手、故我痛恨該醫院玩忽、害人生命、請求庭長從嚴究治被告等應得之罪云云、官據以訊問被告張湘紋供、自訴人之妻李王氏、來院生産、係葛醫生接生、産後葛醫生於七月一日辭職、去後我另請胡彝珠·鄺翠娥·王葆貞·諸醫師輪流診治、自七月一日起、李王氏由胡醫生等看的、七月一日李王氏身體忽發熱一零一度即退、二日又至一零一度多、當時均</p>
<p>以爲乳漲</p>
<p>飲以消乳藥、至七月三日下午、胡醫生檢查李王氏之白血球爲八千多、似不致有産褥熱之病、七月四日下午、自訴人要求領回、我等並未阻止、又據葛成慧供、我僅接生、迨産後我即辭職、在我未走前、李王氏並無病兆、顧琴月供、我係看護長、對病人吃什麽藥、非我所管、每天由胡醫生等診視等語、庭上又傳證人談素珍等訊問一過、官以本案尚須傳訊證人陳景煦醫生等、遂諭退候定期傳證再訊、即退庭、</p>

<p>工部局討論</p>
<h3>公衆運輸問題</h3>
<p>認電車應與公共汽車合作</p>
<p>延長現有路綫並改良設備</p>
<p>丨先當與毗鄰市政當局洽商丨</p>
<p>工部局工務處處長所提、關於公共租界内公衆運輸之說帖一件、經公用委員會、於上次會議時提出討論、其會議錄、業由董事會核准、工務處處長說帖、範圍頗廣、共中某某數點、似以認爲交通問題較爲適當、應由交通委員會核議故公用委員會之討論、以關於電車及公共汽車兩公司之公衆運輸問題爲限、</p>
<p>改良電車問題關於改良電車之問題、工務處處長以爲工部局旣未表示、是否欲於一九四○年收買電車事業、則在電車公司方面、未必願於此時擔承大宗之基本支出、電車之特許合同、係永久性質、惟在滿第三十五年（即一九四○年）時、或其後每滿七年之時、工部局得以六個月之預先通知、以收買此項業見發達之營業、買價以仲裁議定之公允時價爲凖、但並不因强迫收買、或因該公司旣得之營業上信譽、而於買價之外、酌給任何償額、工務處處長以爲電車宜如何改良、應先决定、有軌制度、固業經多數城市棄而不用但就本埠之情形而言、倘欲廢止有軌電車、而代以較爲滿意之其他辦法、當有困難、</p>
<p>建設高架鐵路建設高架鐵路之議、經隨時有人提出、工務處長業將此項提議詳細研究、其結論爲此種公衆運輸辦法、若欲由公共租界單獨採用、事難辦到、且現在之高架鐵道、尚有一種缺點、即下車之多數乘客、必須集中於數處地點、而使交通更見擁擠、</p>
<p>廢除有軌電車工務處處長說帖内提議、將有軌電車廢除、而代以雙層無軌電車、並言增設之無軌電車路綫、與現有無軌電車路綫聯絡、比與有軌路綫聯絡爲易、某委員問、無軌電車緩於雙層公共汽車之處安在、該處長答稱、行駛無軌電車之費用、此行駛以石油發動之車輛爲廉、</p>
<p>詳細討論結果（一）各委員均認爲電車公司與公共汽車公司應彼此合作、而不競爭、並以爲關於此層、須由三市區當道協商辦理、（二）討論時有人建議、謂應由工部局設法、與毘鄰之法租界及上海市政府當局合作、俾關於公衆運輸服務之必要改良、得恊定一種通行辦法、現在三市區之交通聯絡、極感缺乏、但工務處處長以爲三區市府當局、倘能將彼此所有困難、開誠討論、結果或能擬具一種有價值之策略、穿越公共租界之南北交通路綫、現殆完全在中區之内、亟應推展至西區、現時各路有軌及無軌電車之缺乏聯絡與合作、亦是一種缺點、若將外灘之有軌電車軌道移近江邊、則可將外擺渡橋改築、而放寛至八十呎、將現時之有軌電車改爲雙層一層因所有軌道過狹、該處長不能贊同、無軌電車、因可停於路旁、因係便利於交通、但因有人力車之故、不能靠路旁行駛、憑高懸電綫而行駛之無軌電車、有一種缺點、即因其行動爲電綫所限制、乃不能如公共汽車之於開行時互相超越、（三）各委員均以爲工部局應將改良公衆運輸便利一層、向華界及法租界市府當道作初步商洽、並應詢問電車公司、對於改良設備、有何凖備、（四）各委員又以爲、將現有路綫之延長、與改良設備同一重要、惟延長路綫問題、須視與毘鄰兩市府當道商洽之結果如何、方能計及、</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在這一張御座的後面，照例不可避免的有一幅揷屏安着，它的質料也是紫檀木，漆得非常光亮，上面也有價值絶大的美玉和寶石鑲嵌着。然而没有人能够說出它有什麽實在的用處，祇知道它總是和御座相連的丨凡有御座，後面必有揷屏，凡有揷屏，前面必有一張御座。這兩件東西簡直已成一套不可分離的傢具。據說這個習慣，歷代相沿已久，固不僅清宫中如此。可惜没有人能够說得出當初是怎樣造成這一種特殊的習慣的！</p>
<p>我方才說御座後的那架揷屏，誰也不知道它有什麽實在的用處，但到了火車上，却就顯出它的一部份的功效來了。太后向例是時常要睡午覺的，於是我們便特地替他備一張小小軟榻，安放在這一座屏的後面，讓伊在白天裏，可以隨時休息，也無須特地回到那一間小小的寢宫裏去。</p>
<p>我記得很清楚，當我們這一次的旅行才開始的當兒，在永定門車站上，太后由我和另外幾個人扶掖着，初次踏上了這一具新頴的交通利器之後，伊最初似乎很有幾分爲難的神氣；因爲雖然這一座不朝廷和那寢宫中的佈置，都已經過了許多人的設計和努力，較之宫中所有的各座大殿和寢宫，已極神秘，儘可够得上稱贊一聲「匠心别運」，但是它們的面積，却終爲火車的地位所限，無論請敎任何一位大工程師，怕也没法子能把它擴大出來。而太后往日又是習慣於寛敞宏大的塲所的，一旦突然置身於這樣狹窄的屋子裏，精神上當然要感覺到幾許異樣。然而過了五六分鐘，伊也漸漸地習慣起來了。第第一句話，伊便吩咐那些太監去查看清楚伊的這一張御座的方向，是不是確和這一列車前進的方向相同，因爲伊覺得如果背轉着身了，讓這一列火車旋拖着伊，老是向後倒退的話，對於伊的尊嚴是十分有關係的（一○一）</p>
<h3>夏之夜</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>在詩人的筆下，常寫出夏夜的可愛，尤其是帶一點性的氣息的，不錯，我們到都市裏去，是容易找到這一類材料的。不必說上海的舞塲浴塲，以及一切浪漫情調的地方了，單就蘇州的公園說，已是够寫成一部煌煌巨著。</p>
<p>但是，其他的夏之夜，怎樣的過去的呢？除掉露宿在街頭以外，只有鑽火坑似的鴿籠裏去。幸虧今年蚊蟲特别的少，大概爲了久不下雨，他們的生殖力也减低了。的確，形勢很嚴重，我們好久没有聽見街頭招凉的人唱山歌了，這是可以證明他們已没有什麽興味，再欣賞讚美這夏之夜了。我們所常聽到的，是門外的公井，汲水的人，各種不同的桶，和石質的井欄碰擊的聲音，幾乎是有節奏的。我們不禁仰着頭望天，層厭那些霎眼的繁星，老是睜睜地，難道今年的夏之夜，永遠是乾枯得連露珠都綻不成了麽。</p>
<p>都市裏的夏之夜，無論如何，總比鄕村好一點。前幾天，還没有現在這般旱，這般熱，可是我經過鄕村，從船上望到岸上去，幼稚的田禾，憔悴得快要萎枯了。狗吐出二三寸長的紅舌。孩子們浸身在岸灘的淺水中。雖是夕陽已經下山了，暮色已漸漸的加濃，可是一切還在困頓之中，絲毫没有昭蘇的景象。可說。預計他們今年的命運，不知在怎樣的一種階段中，不能不替他們寒心；就是我們自已想想，也將不暇自哀呢。</p>
<h3>申報的哥哥是「華字日報」</h3>
<p>— 景飛鳳</p>
<p>前讀烟橋君「申報的哥哥」一文，據說香港還有一種「循環日報」，去年舉行過七十周年紀念……那麽比申報要長九歲，應當把他稱爲老大哥……。但是作者昨天適巧在申報館附設流通圖書館借閱了現代書局出版的中國新聞事業，（黃天鵬著作，港電帆發行），其中有附錄「新聞界近百年大事紀」中載「紀元一八七二年（即同治十一年）上海申報出版，初爲英人美查所辦，後爲席氏接收，入民國後歸史量才氏，以歷史悠久執全國牛耳。一「紀元一八七三年（卽同治十二年），昭文新報創刊於漢口，艾小梅所主倡，爲華人自辦報紙之始」，「紀元一八七四年（卽同治十三年），循環日報出版，王鞱，王幹，今猶獨立於香港。」這樣看來，香港「循環日報」發行以來，歷史雖然也很悠久，但是還没有申報發行得早，（相差三年不足），那没申報還是「循環日報」的哥哥。據又載「紀元一八六四年（卽同治三年），華字日報出版，爲陳藹亭所主辦，初爲德臣報之中文報，篇幅僅及今日四分之一，材料繙譯西報及轉載京報爲主，今猶存立於香港，爲中國最老報紙之一。」照這樣看來，申報的哥哥，却是「華字日報」，因爲「華字日報」比申報早發行九年。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>約有十分鐘，那老太太出來了，不是自已走的，是個院役攙扶着。老太太滿臉的眼涙，顫巍巍的，張了嘴合不攏來。那院役却只管叮囑他别哭，一路扶出去了。另一個院役，却把關太太引了進去。桂枝看到這種樣了，心早慌了，簡直不知道怎好，只是呆坐着。又過了十多分鐘，那關太太抱了一個孩子，後面跟了兩個孩子，撞跌了出來，他不能像老太太那樣守規矩，早哭出聲來了。他數着苦情道：天啦，扔下這三個孩子給我，怎得了呢？桂枝搶上前，攔着問道：表嫂，怎…怎麽了。關太太垂涙道：殷連長說，他跳下城來没死，在地洞裏睡了一天，黑夜裏爬了出來，才得救的。全營弟兄，回來的只十幾個人，他親眼看到……我這是怎麽好呢？幾個院役，擁了上前，不肯讓他再哭，速推帶勸，擁了他出去。桂枝在這時，心裏眞慌了。想着，若是進去間殷連長的話，那是無疑的，自已也是哭了出來。不進去問他的話，又不知道丈夫究竟。這樣一爲難，竟是先哭了起來。這時正有一個院役，要來引他進去看病人，見他不曾進去，先哭了起來、倒發呆站在一邊，許久才問道：你不進去瞧人嗎？桂枝擦着眼睛道：我怕進去了，他告訴我不好的消息。那院役不懂他什麽意思，又不能久等，回身自走了。桂枝要跟着進去，已來不及，没了主意，又只好到傳達室來，只見那門外邊，田老太太關太太和那幾個孩子圍在一塊兒哭，自已不曾向前，也不知悲從何來，遠遠的也就看着哭起來了。那傳達有五十歲上下，倒是個慈心人，便迎着桂枝道：這位太太，你得看你們連長的消息了嗎？桂枝道：没有呢？我看到進去一個，哭着一個出來，不敢去問殷連長呢。傳達道：瞎！您怎麽不進去呢？不進去怎問得出來。隨我來罷。於是引了桂枝再向前去。（四五二）</p>

<h3>人中寶（上）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>廿三年七月二十三的春秋，載有汪瘦秋君電寶一則，其中所述人形之物，當是鼈所吞入之兒童玩具，决非生成，因馬寶一類，皆爲癖石。予在民國三年曾於淮安親見剖自馬腹中者，大如鵝蛋，外包薄膜，中現青紫紅黃色筋絡甚多，堅硬如石，重可二兩，索價八百元，卒爲藥商購去，予以二十元分得一錢，試以三酸不起反應，正與滑石之性質略同，大都由於飲食之物，含有鎂鹽與砂酸所致，猶之砂淋聚於膀胱，此則聚於胃臟之中，人之患胃癌者，亦正類此。本草綱目卷五十二，於人部載有癖石一條，其集解中所紀甚詳，所述有成人形者，亦指剖面之花斑面言，類乎雲石之文理，能作山水人物形，並非整體能成形也。汪君殆未目見，因而以訛傳誤，此等癖石，各有其名，牛黃鮓答，皆是馬寶之類，在人則稱癖石，而不稱爲寶，因狗馬之屬，本爲賤物，得此則價值奇昂，故以爲寶，人若有此，則致病必死，何寶之有？凡人專嗜某種事物，皆稱爲癖，癖之深者，精神凝聚於壹，因而心血團結，化爲石質，故李時珍所述之陳屍，其癖石皆在心房，蓋與飲食所致者，又有别焉。馬寶爲治瘋癲之靈藥，但必佐以化痰之品，始有奇效，其取義，在於物類相感，故用爲引，凡馬患瘋癲者，剖之必得馬寶，淮安每歲必有一二可得，大抵淮鹽含鎂量多，此馬適飲含有硅酸鈉之水，遂致化合而成硅酸鎂之石質，因感磊塊抑塞，遂致發狂，中醫用藥，都取同類爲引，正與化學原理相符，用馬寶以治人之癥結，蓋以人之癖石，不可得也。馬寶必取活者，人身縱有癖石，從前並無解部活人而取之者，故爲世間所無，本草所收之癖石，亦祗謂由屍體中所得，非活物也，馬寶必取活者，世人稱爲活寶，蓋極言其難得也。惟予家竟有汪君理想中之所謂人寶，亦足以供談助，詳見拙著半畝園贈法國醫士謝璧詩序云，「仲媳苦患河魚之疾，羣醫各說，莫衷一是，每發號痛欲絶，庚午四月一發不止，療治經旬益劇，始就謝璧醫士診察，斷爲宫外孕，非割不治，初未敢試、及至無奈奏刀剖腹，出一巨物如拳，長可半尺，圍近一尺，重約兩磅，外形似胞，内堅疑骨，直切爲三，則竟完全石質，類於馬寶，考之本草，是名癖石，自古以來，從未有於生人腹中取得者，謂能治瘕故保存之。</p>

<h3>東北奴化敎育逐漸具體化</h3>

<h3>各校應行改進要點（八）</h3>
<p>省立湖南大學</p>
<p>該校環境、宜於研究學術、所設院系適合地方需要敎職員多能認眞職務、學生用功守規、招生亦尚嚴格、惟工學院工程館及陳列館、急宜籌建、以樹該院永久之基礎、並啟發人民對於理工實用科學之知識、各系設備、尚嫌簡陋、此後應提高設備費、專爲充實内容、再謀院系之擴充、敎員待遇、並應酌量提高、俾能羅致各方專家、</p>
<h3>私立中法大學</h3>
<p>該校近年以來、尚有相當進展、惟應行改進之處仍多、兹提示要點於次、</p>

<h3>私立武昌文華圖書館學專科學校</h3>
<p>該校辦理尚屬認眞、其所造就人才、頗能適應社會需要、殊堪嘉許、惟該校自有之設備殊嫌簡單、應力求充實、學生實習處所、僅爲華中大學圖書館、其中藏書並不甚多、中文書尤覺缺少、亟應添購圖書、或設法擴充實習機會、以利訓練</p>

<p>貢献話</p>
<h3>從面部到腿部足部</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>舶來脂粉從何去？　腿足原來也化裝！</p>
<p>最近報載北平某大化妝品公司職員謂：目前北平婦女用腿部化裝品計有三類。一爲足指甲之蔲丹膏，此膏分紅藍紫黃，色色俱備，法國産品，每瓶需洋二元至十七八元。二爲膚香膏，此爲塗擦腿部踝部足背足跟足尖足心者，其作用爲使皮膚潤澤，較之面膏，其脂肪質特别豐富，擦之得當，則不難成爲凝脂，此膏上等者，每瓶五元至二十元不等。三爲肉色花粉，此爲敷膏後擦用者，其作用爲凉爽乾燥光潤，故雙腿點妝旣竣，每次所費時間，總在一小時以上，所費金錢，總在三元或十數元以上，而結果則不知消耗多少外貨，摇蕩多少青年，故北平市長袁良取締婦女赤腿裸足，雖我輩販賣商人，略受一時之損失，對社會經濟，國民富力，却裨益不淺云云。這段新聞，很有意思，然而很是可驚，因爲這般摩登女子愛好時髦，結果形成幾種現象，直接的：</p>
<p>（一）今年半年中化裝品脂粉香水的入口八十五萬元。</p>
<p>（二）僅六月份香水脂粉進口十四萬四千零四十四元。</p>
<p>（三）今年半年中時髦婦女服裝四端之花邊五十七萬七千九百六十二元</p>
<p>（四）國内若干襪廠營業不振，請求政府取締奇裝異服。</p>
<p>（五）男子的擔負日巨，負債日多，而失信詐欺捲逃自殺者亦日衆。間接的：</p>
<p>（一）農村破産，益見迅速。</p>
<p>（二）國貨工業，日被洋貨壓倒。</p>
<p>（三）國民經濟，益見萎縮，漸漸入於乾癟之途。</p>
<p>（四）外國人滿載而去，製造若干槍砲飛機，於經濟侵略以外，再爲武力之侵略。</p>
<p>摩登女子，一顰一笑之間，可以斷送金融斵喪國力如此。摩登女子之魔力，着實不少。有其母，必有其子女，有摩登女子，而後有摩登兒童。半年中外國玩具的進口，也有五十七萬餘元。此皆國民之膏血，悍然報效外國人，而無吝色，此爲何等傷心事。在此婦國貨年中，有此現象，更覺十分痛心，其實胭脂花粉面膏，不用固然最好，卽用則國貨出品，何嘗無之，何必定用外國貨以爲榮。凡此化裝諸品，用以敷面，已覺奢華，乃又欲以之敷腿敷足，以博男子之賞鑑，此其用心何在？令人思之不得。吾知女子愛國，决不後人，或者未知此中利害得失，是在家庭母姊學校敎師與社會領袖，及熱心國貨之團體，本其愛用國貨之精神，運以錦心繡口之詞令，逢人勸說，不憚脣疲，果能人人警惕，轉移風氣，或者明年的進口報告，可以省去這筆不正當的支出，挽回破産之農村，扶植工商之元氣，庶幾婦女國貨年中，有些成績表見，吾想這時的摩登女子，不致爲世詬病，爲人痛駡了。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>國貨運動的心理建設</h3>
<p>— 南國佳人</p>
<p>這幾年來内地農村裏面，販賣零頭布匹的小商人一天天多起來，他們的利潤却一天天薄下去。據那些販賣商的呻吟中聽來，還是販賣劣貨比較有幾個錢好賺。要是純粹批賣國貨，便連本都賣不起。理由很簡單：農村裏忠厚而懦善的老百姓，他們没有耳聞到東北同胞亡國的慘痛呼聲，他們没有目覩到閘北吳淞的頽垣殘壁，他們對於敵人的觀念始終還是糢糢糊糊的。他們没有鑒别國貨和外貨的識力。爲了節省幾個銅子來買油米起見，寗可買那些價格低廉而外表美觀的洋貨來替他家天眞無知的兒女們做身新衣裳穿穿。</p>
<p>就日用貨品而言，我們大家知道：某種外國貨比起本國産品來是貨眞價昻的；某種外國貨是和本國産品質地相等而價值却便宜得很多的。這原因大家知道是由於别人家的成本輕，我國産品的成本重。商人不能不顧血本，而可憐的貧窮的消費者爲了自身的生活問題，又是錙銖必較。於是提倡國貨便成了單單好聽的口號了。</p>
<p>國貨運動旣以剌激國民對於本國産業生産品的消費爲惟一目的，根本辦法，自在於生産成本的减輕，使國貨産品的價格至少要比洋商或在華外廠的同樣産品低廉。减輕生産成本的方法，在於生産技術的改進和稅則的調節。這兩項重要工作，要靠本國産業界與本國政府的積極奮鬥。這不是短時期内輕而易舉的事。所以在這過渡時期，消費的民衆方面，應該大家喚起一種民族的精神，來切實從事於消費國貨的心理建設。</p>
<p>大概愛用舶來貨品者的心理的分析，在資産階級的人們，無非是（一），愛慕奢侈：（二），愛學時髦；（三），愛經久耐用的好貨。在平民方面，於同樣的具有上述三種心理之外，還具備着（一），貪便宜的心理：（二），圖好看的心理：（三），不負責的心理。</p>
<p>愛用舶來貨品的人們，並不是些愚昧無知的國民，也許是有着不少知慧過人的。他們心理，也許以爲中國未必因我一人愛用洋貨而亡國；也未必因爲我一人全用國貨而便一躍爲富强之國。他們心理，以爲爲了專買國貨而放棄價廉物美的舶來品，是於個人或家庭經濟上受無形損失的，這不是聰明人做的事。</p>
<p>這些病態的心理，便是國貨運動的大敵。比敵人的飛機在礮的有形的力量還大得多。吾們非把它矯正一番不可！</p>

<p>「歷史的演進，總是向前的，」我們倘根據了這句話，而站在這個階段上，抓住了現實，去行一個「提倡國貨」的巡禮，那麽，我想事實的顯示，一定爲使你感到十二分失望的，自然，在這裏，旁的我們且不說，單是以這「婦女國貨年」中過去的七個月來講，關於國貨前途發展的福音、是絲毫未聞，而洋貨充斥，瘋狂傾銷的呼聲，却反在我們的耳邊不絶擾攘，國際貿易局在最近發表本年度六個月入超，計三萬萬元，内中婦女所耗奢侈品丨香水脂粉化裝用具，已佔九十七萬餘元，而鑲旗袍用的花邊，聞也達六十萬元，至舶來紗綢輸入，自尤不計其數，我們所唯一希冀婦女界的結果，乃得這樣驚人的表現，自已够使我們不僅「失望」，而感到深切的「痛心」了。</p>
<p>不過，國貨前途的進展，爲什麽這樣呆滯，而不易開拓呢？那麽問題的癥結，我敢說是純爲一種惡劣心理所矇蔽，事實是這樣，在現下不知有多少的國人，他們都抱着這一種劣根性的觀念，他以爲我全國人士共有四萬萬多呢！我一個人的採用外貨，貪點便宜，這是無關大局的，也不致影響整個經濟的興衰的，於是，便把洋貨，仇貨，大用特用但他那曉得假定國人個個和他這樣，只要每人每年入超二元，而四萬萬五千萬人的總和，已是九萬萬元的驚人巨數了，那麽試思，我人這種惡劣觀念還應存在嗎？恐怕多在一天，就是把自已的血肉，多被人家壓榨一天，而距離國亡家破的日子近一天哩。</p>
<p>因此，我們從這一個很好的敎訓下，「自我做起」這心理，自也就成了補救現實的唯一法門了，本來，提倡國貨這回事，是全靠脚踏實地，切實做去，要人人决心，個個努力的，今年定名爲「婦女國貨年」，人們的有望於婦女界，本至深且殷，那麽我做家庭主婦的，自更應明瞭此點，把以前「自私」的思想，根本悔悟，而本着「自我做起」的精神，從今日起誓志服用國貨，以挽回這「婦女國貨年」的厄運，去造成光榮的一頁。</p>
<h3>社敎人員應切實負提倡國貨的責任</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>談到了國貨問題，大家都異口同聲的說道：「提倡國貨，固然需要全國人士共同努力，在上者更應以身作則，那末，君子之德風，遍行全國，其收效尤大，可是，根本的問題，我們還是認爲應該從敎育入手，在兒童敎育上，盡力灌注服用國貨的觀念，爲國貨前途，打下一層根深蒂固的基礎，當然是一個萬年根本大計，可是，爲救濟目前國貨運動的危機計，而社會敎育，似乎尤其應該負起這個提倡國貨，服用國貨的責任</p>
<h3>國貨之新希望</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>，因爲在社敎機關關服務的人，天天和一般的民衆接觸，耳所聞，目所視，其影響更來得偉大…」，這種論調，記者認爲確有討論之價值。</p>
<p>誰都知道，社敎機關的職員，是負有訓練民衆，敎育民衆，指導民衆的責任，其使命是十分重大的，職是之故，社敎罷員之時時和民衆相接觸，是一件免不了的事，在和民衆接觸的時候，第一先要給一般民衆一個良好的印象，假如一個西裝革履的社敎人員，跑到鄕下去，和民衆談話，膽小的民衆，早已逃之天天，不敢來和你接近了，就是來和你接近的民衆，你無論如何也引不起他們的信仰和同情，不僅如此，恐怕還要得到壞的觀念呢？從前有一個笑話，說某處一個社敎機關，有一次舉行國貨展覽會，在開會的時候，民衆到的倒也不少，有一位穿了洋貨西裝的先生，上去演講，提倡國貨的重要，話還没有說，羣衆中一位民衆起來責問道：「今天是國貨運動，我們不歡迎穿了洋貨西裝的闊老，上台演說」，這樣一來，引起了全塲的同情，而這位西裝朋友，赤紅了臉，抱而竄竄而退，這倒是一件實情，大可以做社敎人員一個嚴重的敎訓，就此事而論，可見以身作則，是一件何等重要的事？做全國社敎人員的南針，尤其是一個社敎機關的領袖，人人應該如此，個個應該這樣，那末，和一般民衆接近起來，說的話，格外來得有效，同時，穿了國貨衣裝，和民衆談提倡國貨，也格外來得動聽，格外來得使人信仰，這倒是全國社敎人員，所不可不注意的一件事。</p>
<p>末了，我至誠的希望全國社敎機關的領袖們，和獻身社會敎育的同志們，大家來切實負起提倡國貨，服用國貨的責任，那末，君子之德風，自然可以影響到一般的民衆了。</p>
<h3>從玩具進口想到惠山泥人</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>國貨年提倡國貨聲中，洋貨却源源而來，眞是吾國的怪現象！也是吾國洗雪不掉的奇恥！大辱！</p>
<p>據報載國際貿易局八月二日發表游戲玩具本年六個月進口爲二九二·一九五金單位，折合國幣爲五七七·九六二元，較上年六個月進口二三三·一八八金單位相比激增頗鉅云。</p>
<p>小兒玩具要買外國貨，適足以養成小朋友們的買洋貨心理丨丨鄙視國貨丨這是誰應負的責任？</p>
<p>從玩具進口，想到我們無錫的惠山泥人，手工藝的發達，遊歷無錫的，誰都知道，泥做的小玩意，無不匠心獨運，維妙維肖，什麽飛禽，走獸，古聖典型！平劇種種，巧奪天工，惜不能科學化，利用模型澆製，無土質學者的研究！無大規模組織的玩具公司，無推銷得法的其他機關，終於故步自封！無輸出國外的能力！坐見外國玩具，麻醉我們兒童！眞是很可痛心的事！我希望從改良惠山泥人，推銷惠山泥人做起，徵集全國各地自已製造的玩具，大家作一廓清外國玩具運動！到了明年今日，我們不再見有玩具進口的駭人數字纔好！</p>

<h3>從花邊消耗說到婦女國貨年</h3>
<p>— 姚成軒</p>
<p>莊子說：「哀莫大於心死」，梁啟超在東方報的滿清辯亡論上說：「慘莫慘於國亡」。我們看了這兩句至理名言，至少要對這山河破碎的破落户，生出欲哭無涙的深自隱痛！去年的國貨年的舊恨未除掉，而今年的婦女國貨年的新愁，却紛至沓來，試問「天下興亡」，匹夫有責」的「責」字，幾許人覺悟而荷起重任來呢？上海是東亞第一大埠，全國繁華，商業，文化所萃，物質文明，當然隨歐風的東漸，美雨的灌溉，比内地高到沸點。我們正在悲痛香水脂粉的巨額消耗，金錢外溢，那知道這裝飾品的花邊，半年中要消耗六十萬元，這是何等可以感慨的一件事，雖然好美是人類的天性，但愛國也是天性，人非木石，孰能無感，難道中國人是凉血動物嗎？而且花邊的推銷員，在部份是婦女的份兒，因爲婦女的虚榮心，比男子格外厲害，她們不惜以有用的金錢，寶貴的光隂，消磨在這不值一笑的服裝上面，唉！爲了區區的可免的　花邊，竟至連國家都不顧，何等的可嘆！而且國貨的花邊裝飾上去也不見得有損尊容，婦女國貨年這名詞是何等的光榮，立在時代偉大性上的婦女們，宜如何的警惕！挽救這危機四伏的破落户！</p>
<p>婦女國貨年的用意是什麽？爲什麽定今年爲婦女國貨年？自從讓娘兒們來幹以後的成績怎樣？光隂是如水的逝去，連頭帶尾也不過四個月了！我希望婦女們在這短促的時期裏，多少有點成績出來，做一個模範才好。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨應該多開映國貨影片</h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>我們提倡國貨，不特是在衣食貨物方而，要處處注意，就是在娱樂方面，也應該關心到國貨方面，比喻宴客酬酢的時候，不一定要用外國的酒類飲品，我們中國出品的東西，未見得不見及於舶來品吧！其次對於化裝品的輸入，也根尼驚人，何苦以有用的金　，　　人家作槍砲炸彈之費呢？爲了挽救祖國利權不外溢，個個人應該注意到國貨，不要喜歡購買人家的東西，以爲豪華吧。</p>
<p>我是一個電影迷，喜歉看電影，好在我的胃口，無論好歹，不分優劣，祇要有工夫，我就到電影院中去，好在蘇州的電影，價廉物還美，所以我每逢星期六和星期日，變成了電影院中老主顧了。有時應友人之約，在其餘的幾天，也去欣賞的。也許中國人崇拜外片的心理，來得濃厚些吧！就是不懂英語的人，（這是指有聲）也喜看外國片了，聽難以明白的言語，好像與趨勝過了國片，這不知道是什麽心理呢？</p>
<p>偶然翻了一下某報七月三十日的本埠增刊，其中開映外國片的電影院，到佔了四分之三，可見得上海人的崇拜外片事。但是就是内地來講，蘇州地方，何曾不是這樣呢？好像看了外國片，明知有時弄得情節一點也不懂，很有許多人自以爲津津有味咧！這一筆的支出，我想起來，不亞於化裝品的輸入吧！但是要弄清我的立意，我們並不是要拒絶外片，至少應該多開映些國産片，使得中國的電影，有所進展和蓬勃，否則外國片充塞市上，中國片不是受了打擊了嗎？照良心而論，中國有幾家公司，所産影片，還不至於說極壞，多少有一看之價值，旣然有國産片可以看，那末何必用成千成萬的金錢，去送給人家呢？所以我的主張，提倡國貨，應該開映國貨影片，這也是一個極有價值的問題，對於中國經濟上，有不少密切的關係，關心國貨前途的人，應該怎樣挽回國人重視國片的心理呀。</p>
<p>末了我不是批評外片的不好，我覺得外片十張是九張，什麽玉腿高飛，乳峰突聳一類的肉感片子，多少使得青年人看了有些惹魔，這是實在話，我很喜歡澈底的說來，除了軍事片外，大半是肉感片子，在中國新生活指導之下，我覺得在新生活中人，應該怎樣發奮鬭强，猛進有爲，難道消魂於玉腿高飛，乳峰突聳之下嗎？（我對於什麽歌舞團當然更不贊成的）</p>
<p>從這機看來，熱心國貨的人，也要注意到提倡國貨，應該多開映國貨影片，這個問題，多少有些討論的價值呀？</p>

<h3>黃泥崗</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>白日　歌唱不平曲智多星演講愛國辭</p>
<p>赤日炎炎似火燒，滿田禾稻半枯焦。農夫心内如湯煮：公子王孫把扇摇。</p>
<p>話說白日鼠白勝，挑着酒担，唱着那首山歌，向黃泥崗大道上行來。這時正是正午天氣，流金爍火，半空兒没一些雲彩，累得他客角上汗珠兒像黃豆般掛下來。可是十萬貫金珠寶兕，在他眼前閃爍，他忘記了甚麽兒炎熱：他也不顧那犯法不犯法，身子輕鬆，精神抖擻，一步步走上崗來。到得松樹林下，那裏有楊志一夥人蹤跡，只見那晁蓋，吳用，公孫勝，劉唐，三阮弟兄七人，假扮了販棗子客人，擺着幾輛江州車兒，也在等候着。當下白勝和七人見了禮，喘着氣說道：「敢是那側們不走這道嗎？否則也該來的了。」赤髮鬼劉唐說道：「我打聽得千眞萬確，一定上這道兒來，怕不要路上有些岔子，所以遲延。一阮小七高聲喝道：「管他媽！我們候在這裏，十天半月也不打緊：倘　别的客商經過，我們先發他個利市，總沾得些油水。」晁蓋點頭說好。正在說時，阮小二指着北面的山坂上說道：「這不是一夥人來了麽！遮莫便是那是楊志送寶貨給我們。」吳用便吩咐且莫高聲，我們照計行事。不多一回，那夥人走到松林底下，實在天熱難當，各各卸下担物，在樹蔭下坐地。阮小五挺着撲刀，跳出樹林，對着這夥人說道：「曉事的快留下買路錢來。」這夥人見阮小五相貌狰獰，來勢兇惡，一個爬下地來求饒。其中有膽大的幾個，邊求邊告道：「大王爺！可憐我們墊了本錢，費了氣力，到河北去販壁土産，打算上東京去嵰些澆裏之資。那知道沿路關卡重，横征暴斂，這貨成本已不輕：到東京去銷得去銷不去，還是問題。現在我們的土産，一般華貴子弟都不喜用，反而去作成到些紅毛商的貨物，我們閑常已受苦够了，那裏還有金銀獻給大王們呢！」阮小五瞪着說道：「我不管這些，有錢獻錢，没錢送命。」說着便把撲刀搠下。那時林子裏的吳學究，已聽了多時，跳出來便說道：「兄弟草動粗聽我講來：這般商人他們販買些土産，不論賺錢折本，銀錢總在自家人腰包裏，楚弓楚得，對於國家命脈無傷，並且他們不貪重利，不肯把銀錢送給外人，眞呌人說好稱妙的重情。我們做强盜的雖没天理，也有人心對於這般可敬的人物，豈可下這辣手。只可惜現下官家昏憤，對於這般人只知壓榨，不加保護，反呌那一般紅毛商人，倚勢横行，不值價的貨物，騙了我們錢去，把我們的錢招兵買馬，積草屯糧，三五年斷要動一次干戈，你想可痛不可痛！」吳用說得這裏，旁邊躥出阮小七來，高聲喊道：「兀的不氣煞了人！我們也不要刦甚麽生辱綱，貪圖富貴，快上山去殺那紅毛國人去。」吳用又摇手道：「兄弟莫性急，這紅毛國人經商賣買，也没大罪，我們殺他没來由。我們一方面以身作則，自已不用紅毛貨；再去懲戒那販私的奸商，愛用上貨的狗男女，纔是道理咧！一衆人聽了這番話，個個點頭稱是。要知後事如何？下回並没分講，閱者們自已猜想吧！</p>

<h3>汽水</h3>

<p>人物：顧客店夥</p>
<p>時間：二十三年夏季某日的下午</p>
<p>佈景：飲冰室，有一個店夥守着，（幕開，一顧客自外入室。）</p>
<p>客：拿瓶汽水來！</p>
<p>夥：要什麽牌子的？</p>
<p>客：（坐下）當然是ＸＸＸ，中國貨有什麽好？</p>
<p>夥：中國貨也不差呢？汽也很足！</p>
<p>客：（露不耐態，）我祇要ＸＸＸ，（以手指内，）你快些去拿來。</p>
<p>夥：（不語入内），（取汽水出，傾入杯中，至客前，）先生！這味道不差麽？</p>
<p>客：（且飲且語）ＸＸＸ當然比中國貨好！你看國貨那有這好？</p>
<p>夥：（微笑）先生！請你原諒，因爲我做了件欺騙的事情，你道這是ＸＸＸ麽？不是的，這是國貨！</p>
<p>客：（現驚異狀）這眞是國貨麽？怎樣味道和外國貨差不多呢？</p>
<p>夥：先生！這都是心理的作用，你若以是國貨是好的，那麽你飲國貨的時候，就覺得得牠是好的，你若是以爲國貨是壞的，那麽飲國貨的時候，也覺得牠是壞的，你常常以爲外貨是好的，那麽你不知不覺地飲的時候，也以爲牠是外貨了，其實國貨與外貨，簡直没有什麽分别丨</p>
<p>客：（微露慚愧狀），快！再拿一瓶來罷幕閉</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3>介紹一種夏令的鞋</h3>
<p>— 卞北辰</p>
<p>鞋，尤其是婦女們的鞋，她們因爲要使得自已增加漂亮起見，所以便不惜犧牲大量的金錢，來購買外國貨的皮鞋，雖然其中也有不少爲國人自製，可是原料都免不了爲舶來品呵！</p>
<p>如果我們把歷年進口的原料，加以精詳的統計，那到是一筆很驚人的數目。</p>
<p>現在是夏季了，一般的摩登太太和小姐們，又在裸着腿穿着歐美最流行的露着脚趾的皮鞋了，據說：唯一的原因，是凉爽舒適和漂亮，不過在凉爽舒適漂亮中，不知不覺地送給外人許多飛機和大砲。</p>
<p>我來介紹一種純粹國貨的鞋子，牠的原料是用花帶和白布札底製成的；一樣可以露着脚趾和凉爽舒適漂亮，以前向爲僧尼們採用，可是最近本市已有多數的婦女穿着，其美觀并不亞於來路貨的皮鞋。</p>
<p>聽說：該鞋的購買處，在各處較大的寺宇和出售佛學用品的商店。</p>
<p>現在我來將牠的優點，寫在下面：（一）價格公道，每雙僅售洋四五角。</p>
<p>（二）物質輕巧，便於長途旅行；</p>
<p>（三）完全國貨，杜實漏巵。</p>
<p>最後，我竭誠的希望一般影星，舞后，交際花，來一致的提倡；同時，更希望婦女們！來一致的採購。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>看書瑣記（二）</h3>
<p>— 焉于</p>
<p>就在同時代，同國度裏，說話也會彼此說不通的。</p>
<p>巴比塞有一篇很有意思的短篇小說，呌作「本國話和外國話」，記的是法國的一個闊人家裏招待了歐戰中出死入生的三個兵，小姐出來招呼了，但無話可說，勉勉强强的說了幾句，他們也無話可答，倒只覺得坐在闊房間裏，小心得骨頭疼。直到溜回自已的「猪窠」裏，他們這才遍身舒齊，有說有笑，並且在德國俘虜裏，由手勢發見了說他們的「我們的話」的人。</p>
<p>因了這經騐，有一個兵便模模胡胡的想：「這博間有兩個世界。一個是戰爭的世界。别一個是有着保險箱門一般的，禮拜堂一般乾凈的廚房，漂亮的房子的世界。完全是另外的世界。另外的國度。那裏面，住着古怪想頭的外國人。」</p>
<p>那小姐後來對一位紳士說的是：「和他們是連話都談不來的。好像他們和我們之間，是有着跳不過的深淵似的。」</p>
<p>其實，這也無須小姐和兵們是這樣。就是我們丨丨算作「封建餘孼」或「買辦」或别的什麽而論都可以丨丨和幾乎同類的人，只要什麽地方有些不同，又得心口如一，就往往免不了彼此無話可說。不過我們中國人是聰明的，有些人早已發明了一種萬應靈藥，就是「今天天氣……哈哈哈！」倘是宴會，就只猜拳，不發議論。</p>
<p>這樣看來，文學要普遍而且永久，恐怕實在有些艱難。「今天天氣……哈哈哈！」雖然有些普遍，但能否永久，却很可疑，而且也不大像文學。於是高超的文學家便自已定了一條規則，將不懂他的「文學」的人們，都推出「人類」之外，以保持其普遍性。文學還有别的性，他是不肯說破的，因此也只好用這手段。然而這麽一來，「文學」存在，「人」却不多了。</p>
<p>於是而據說文學愈高超，懂得的人就愈少，高超之極，那普遍性和永久性便只匯集於作者一個人。然而文學家却又悲哀起來，說是吐血了，這眞是没有法了想。</p>
<h3>邊地夜記（上）</h3>
<p>— 吴嚴</p>
<p>本該在「野車旬」那個鎭上宿夜了的，但怕山賊尾來襲擊，保商隊便又在暮色凄迷的小原野中，前進了十里。等到人馬走近罄口的時候，深藍色的晚空中，已經開滿朶朶燦然的星花了。</p>
<p>罄口是個臨着大路的小村子，居民全是些做莊稼的。當保商隊的風雨燈，摇曳着長長的白光，緩緩走進走時，便處處閃現出了矮小的屋子，圓圓的稻草堆，黑鬱鬱的雜樹。</p>
<p>村犬剛剛大聲地吠着，猛撲過來，便又立刻發出長嚎的呌聲，逃到伏在夜影中的屋後去了。接着到處起了驟然關門的聲響，和孩了的啼哭。</p>
<p>在星空下靜靜伏着的村落，便一霎時驚醒起來，戰抖着了。人的汗，馬的汗，就將先前浮散在空中的花草樹脂的氣味，完全冲洗乾凈。</p>
<p>差不多每一個人家裏，都有保商隊的弟兄走了進去，把槍架在屋角，就任意在板凳上，桌子上，坐着躺着起來。我不大高興同他們在一道息宿，便打算尋找一處偏僻地方的矮屋子丨丨保商隊的弟兄不喜歡去的所在。結果，在村落的盡頭找着了。門是關着的，屋裏只有微明的燈火，從板壁縫裏漏了出來。大約是聽見了我的足聲吧，屋裏的燈驟然熄了，我却不管屋主人歡迎不歡迎，就一直上前去敲門。好一會，因爲門敲得太厲害了，才聽見一個老婆的聲音，顫抖抖地說道「可憐我們吧！這裏一點東西也没有了！……唉，大慈大悲的菩薩呵！」</p>
<p>「老媽媽，不要怕，我是來借宿的，……我是個好人！</p>
<p>沉默了一陣，也許她正開始從門縫裏端詳我吧，才又發出氣促的聲音，只是比剛才略略鎭靜了些。</p>
<p>「那末，那末，客人你請到别家去吧，……我這裏怪窄呀！」</p>
<p>「老媽媽，别家都住滿人了，請留我住一夜呵，我給錢的。」</p>
<p>我見她仍在懷疑我，便十分誠懇地請求着。她没有答話，只覺得她的足聲，輕輕地響到裏面去了。我立了一陣，打算要走，却忽然聽見有人從裏面出來，一個男子的聲音在說這樣的話。</p>
<p>「老媽媽，不要緊，一切看在菩薩面上，菩薩會照應你的！」</p>
<h3>淄博印象</h3>
<p>— 羅王</p>
<p>（六）礦工生活</p>
<p>在淄川，我們見到無數的人們，他們像是黑奴，又像是蹦蹦戲裏邊的「呆瓜」，滿臉污黑，只露着兩個大白眼，向着人們看！這些人便是炭礦夫！</p>
<p>礦工的生活，我們作了一些小小的訪問，而没有得到多少資料。但僅就魯大公司的礦工說，由下井鑿炭，地下運輸，篩工等，有好多的種類。自然是下井的工人最苦，他們深入到地下層三百米至七百米以下，唯一的良友就是一盞礦燈！每日工作，日夜工俱在十二小時以上，從前工資還好，要在兩三塊左右，如今每日不過從五六毛至八九毛而已！</p>
<p>礦工最怕的就是大雨，因爲這能使水灌礦中，有全遭滅頂之懼。所以工人平日最忌「滿」字，斟酒的時候「滿了」只說「乾了」！這是礦工生活中的一種特别說明！</p>
<p>在博山礦工更多了！居民多靠做礦工過活！還有堆炭夫也不計其數。</p>
<p>在過去，工人生活非常的優裕·因爲煤炭賣得起價錢，工價也因而貴。舊式小規模（現在大多還是如此）的礦井，冬是鑿一條三尺左右高的隧道，工人要灣着腰爬在地上向前進的，工作雖苦，但是報酬很豐，工人們常是做一天，得兩三塊錢的報酬，便歇兩天。而因爲錢來得容易，所以工人向來是今日有酒今朝醉，直到錢使完了才再去抓煤洞！那時的工人穿的是綢，吃的是油，所以博山大綢緞舖子多，菜館飯店也多：等到世界經濟恐慌的大潮緊壓着礦區，外煤的傾銷，擠塞了中煤的銷路，於是工價日漸低落了！從前單是推煤屑的一天可以掙到兩塊錢以上，如今推了一天也不到一塊錢，生活程度日漸增高，收入日漸减少；所以在博山，雖然有爲開礦發了幾十萬的大財主，同時也自然而然地産生了無數的受着經濟壓迫的工人！所以在博山，每日總有吊死的人！</p>
<p>我們演劇的地方，呌做上河攤，那是一個窰貨市！平日（不逢集的日子）據說輕易没有人打那兒過，因爲那兒每晚可以聽到鬼哭神嚎，這些話當然是當地人的傳言，然而可以證實了「自掛東南枝」的人們確實不少！我們的伙伴曾到一個林野，親眼見到一個人高懸在空際！頸子却繫在樹校的上面！這種死亡，是社會經濟狀况所造成的。在這裏，我不想發什麽議論，只想請大家對於當前的事實，加以注視！</p>
<h3>公園裏</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>丨上海心聲之二丨樹木草地，池塘，矮長椅加上大大小小的男男女女，公園裏是熱閙的。</p>
<h3>浦濱公園之夏</h3>
<p>— 亦菴寫</p>
<h3>我來自東（十八）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>從船離神户以後，同船的幾個廣東人，便很鄭重地考慮登岸問題。他們是在美國掙了幾十年的錢，現在回故鄕去退休的。他們在吸烟室裏鬼鬼崇的談着，說上海的夜裏，是怎樣可怕。指上有金戒，别人會拉着去，身上穿好一些的衣服，便有人用鏹酸水來澆，如果人家知道你是有錢的，你便會被綁走或被殺死。他們交頭接耳的互相告訴，似乎大難便在目前。</p>
<p>有一位曾在芝加哥開菜館的廣東夫婦，尤其是怕慌。妻子是年輕又帶點浪漫的舊金山華僑姑娘，硬要當天到上海去：丈夫年紀大了，挣了幾萬塊錢，覺得中國到處有手伸出，要他的錢或要他的命的，所以堅持在船上過夜，非到香港不上岸。他告訴我，中國是不行的，當他在芝加哥開店時，凡國内有人來，不是要募學校捐便是來募飛機捐，他每年要化幾千塊錢來應付道些事情。他說自已没有對不起國家，國家老是向他麻煩。我想他這句話是誠懇的。</p>
<p>夕陽照在黃色的波浪上，甲板上聚集着大羣的船客，大家對於上海抱着好奇心和懼怕心。長江口排着兩條極細的岸影，岸影向我們夾囂，前面去漸見帆船三五。近了吳淞口，甲板上大家指手畫脚的談着淞滬大戰時情形。船上的水手，因爲在大戰時曾在船上親眼觀戰的，描寫得更其有聲有色。大家把這件事當做封神榜或三國志一樣的講着。好奇的美國人們怨恨没有親眼看見這一幕好戲。</p>
<p>到了浦東老太古碼頭，已經是暮色蒼蒼了。煤烟和晚霧相混，把上海全城籠罩在灰色幕中，沙遜巨厦和匯豐銀行，海關鐘樓和未成的國際飯店，都露出依稀影子。黃浦江眞是狹，當我們的郵船轉個身時，船身横住了江面，便把全江鎖住，什麽船都不好來往。我於是聯想到日俄大戰時的旅順港沈船的故事。我又幻想到如果國際戰爭在遠東發生時各種耐人深味的現象及戰略。</p>
<p>上海到處是嗡嗡之聲。世界囂雜的埠頭，此處要算第一了。傍晚忽忽地和船上幾個友人，坐小汽船自老太古碼頭到新關碼頭來。小艇中擠滿了人。小江中擠滿了船。馬路上擠滿了車子。好像處處無動彈之餘地，新關碼頭上更是人多，我們在人羣中擠出。是本是地小人多的國家，然而在神户横濱的碼頭，寥寥的看不到幾個人影，紐約倫敦的商務比上海總要繁盛些，然而你决不至於到了紐約倫敦而在人堆中擠過。四萬萬人口是一個可長的勢力，然而四萬萬人都亂擠一陣，也没有什麽可畏了。</p>
<h3>關於「淄博印象」第一節中的「？」</h3>
<p>羅王君來函</p>
<p>本文第一節中所稱看戲觀衆係二三「千」人！編者在「千」字下加一「？」，或疑錯誤！但我們底户外演劇到兩三千人是常有的事，這是「實數」，與一般ＸＸ運動大會的「到會者數萬人」一語，意義不同。那麽，如果有人不信，我可以再報告一句，我們在各縣放映電影，各縣四鄕居民距城二十里外亦有來看的，每晚至少有萬人，多的時候能到三四萬，一片廣塲，地上坐滿了的人，在仰頭齊望銀幕。這是在南方的朋友所不易想像到的，熱而在民智未開的北方這種事實却不足爲奇啊！</p>

<h3>標紗突飛孟晋</h3>
<p>遠月發現一百九十二元新高峯</p>
<p>紗市續漲、形勢愈趨愈緊、實以醖釀已久、一且燥發、勢難遏制、此次狂漲最大主因、半由於華南北對於現紗採辦接踵而來、津帮以華紗較日紗爲廉、搜羅粗紗尤急、半由於各廠十六支均告空罄、有數廠業已缺貨、且近來粉麥物價暴騰、金融界大爲獲利，於是改變計劃、在標紗花市塲亦大量的吸收做多、因之人心激動、買風突起、遠月發現一百九十二元之最高峯矣，</p>
<h3>金鷄狂跳二三元</h3>

<h3>標紗漲潮波動標花</h3>
<p>棉市趨漲、形勢續挺、以美棉穩定、標紗狂漲、致唇齒相依之棉市、益覺激動、惟價格一高、通帮及源大兩商號拗賣殊巨，皆被金融界吸進、故雙方均有相當的敵力、惟廠商仍無購辦消息、所以棉市漲風不及紗市之猛烈、明日美棉佔計發表、本棉當有一度變遷云、</p>

<h3>粉麥猛進銳退</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市、經前日之追收證金、停市一天、惟市塲形勢、因環境之惡劣、及外行人心之良好、在開價之前、預料開價必漲、又無疑義、當上午開拍時、以兩日來、坎拿大與芝加哥報價、計續漲一元一二角左右、故本月份開價、即狂提至六角六分、遠期雖亦同趨漲度、約計祇三五分不等、不料二盤之後、因業外買氣仍暢、不限市價、紛紛狂吸、至三盤結果、近遠各期、均較週一市面、又狂提一角至一角二三分之巨、如十一月份以下均高至九角關外、投機之狂妄、不難想見矣、迨至下午開盤、人心繼奮、本月份竟高至八角八分半、此種紀錄、爲三四年來之創見、九十月份之開價、亦續俏一二分、但聞各廠方面、因維持物價起見、有連合抛售之傳說、當最高時、曾亦抛售甚猛、故至十一月份開價雖好、終則步步大跌、十二及一月份、亦同此情形、市塲浮多、鑒風頭之逆轉、於二盤開價、即見紛紛狂出、市價亦一瀉千里、回跌之猛烈、亦不亞高漲中之洋洋大觀也、自此之後、各盤均跌、尤以十一月份以下爲更猛、與上午之差度、亦達一角半之巨、結果本月份較停市前仍好三分、九十月份好二釐半、十一月份反跌三分二釐半、十二月份跌三分半、一月份跌一分云、交易所自昨日起、證金又已改變、凡賣買雙方、均增爲七百五十元、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、因洋麥報價、兩日中計漲一元一二角左右、人心方面異常激昂、本月份開價三角、九月份四角、比停市前漲度彷彿至一角七八分左右、在目下市面已入狂途之際、尚覺並不嚴重、但至二盤後、因期紛之接續狂漲、一時買氣之盛、無以復加、本月份最高至四角二分、九月份至六角一分、十月份至七角三分、十一十二月至七角三四分、較週一市面、竟又狂漲二角·三四角至三角一二分之巨、此種接連之暴漲、實爲自有交易所以來之第一次也、迨至下午開盤、本月份初仍繼漲六七分、惟至九月份開價、因期粉局面已呈疲象、各月份開價、亦復步跌、本月份低至三角、九月份至四角四分、平均回跌一角至二角二三四分之巨、惟較停市前、仍然見勝也、結果本月份漲二角、九月份漲一角半、十月份漲八分、十一月份漲七分、十二月份漲六分、一月上午漲一角六分、下午則回跌與前相等、現麥市面、以標凖高昂、人心亦俏、高貨如山東徐州等麥已喊至四元四角、中次喊二三角左右、共開一萬餘包、至内地包子、如蘇州貨已喊七元云、</p>
<h3>九江帮暢辦洋客秈</h3>

<h3>黃豆漲風稍歛</h3>
<p>生豆油一再上騰</p>
<p>昨日陳豆市勢，漲風稍歛、實因去路少减、統市成交車輪各豆十一二車、由本街零星去化、廠方不動、行情漲一角半、午後連電雖報漲、但市氣依然不振、故人心略數、新豆惟六月白開一百六十包、價漲三角、九江新豆因來源斷續、存豆貨主守候野價、故無成交者、祗由行家回出六十包、城門豆價開四元四角、油情比較豆市不同原因産價日升、來源不接、存底實屬不厚、所以市價一再上漲、計豆油漲八角、花生油漲半元、後情尚屬堅挺云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>取締不良私中</h3>
<p>— ＯＨ</p>
<p>口實是「整頓敎育」，這是誰也不敢置喙而且無可多辯的！</p>
<p>然而，我們須得承認「一件事實的存在，决不是偶然的」。自有牠的「社會背景」在焉！那麽、我們對於「私中的取締」，也不能認爲是單獨的問題，至少，要在取締私中之前、先考查一下私中所以能存在於社會的原因，然後再去治核，纔不會變成「治標」了！</p>
<p>這兩天、打開報紙，確是琳瑯滿自，東也招生，西也招生，有的甚至於把商業廣告的手腕都施用了、如ＸＸ校的「餘額無多，報名從速」，以及其他各校的美麗文句，甚麽「本校空氣清鮮，交通便利」啊，「設備完全」啊，諸如此類，無非是「拉客」手腕，而完全的「營業化」了！至於官辦的呢？報紙上雖有時也登着廣告，本校幾時招生，但到投考的日子呢，所需要的數目只能及應考者之十分之幾的比例，固然，許多學子是落第了！</p>
<p>這種落第的學子敎他們往那裏去呢！那是私中發達的原因了，許多落第的學子，只要稍有能力求學者、都得進一進學校，（在普通的心理中，進過學校，便是受過敎育的人，同時，找職業也比較容易！）但官辦的名額有限，爲逼迫而不得不見那些報紙上登載誘人廣告，便投入那種學校裏去了！</p>
<p>但，這只是一部分的原因，同時，還有一班「讀書爲幌子的人」，在這班人心目中，讀書只是目前的一番必經手續，將來並不是依靠讀書吃飯的，因此，功課到不必注意，好在只當牠是一個幌子，不讀倒似乎有些過不去，便是在社會上聽來也不大入耳。這班人進嚴格的學校嗎？太苦，不慣。因此，「搿來脫花探兒」式私中學校，他們是很配他們的口味。</p>
<p>然而，「私中」不一定比「官辦」壞，有許多「私中」的經費比「官辦」的寛裕都有，可是祗有少數的少數。同時，官辦學校裏的學生不都是勤讀的學生，在一切都有欺騙的現代、在敎育界中也恐難以避免。有若干有眞才實學的人而考不進ＸＸ校，而掛名學籍的人認識校董或校長之戚竟得昻然而進，反使眞正求學子弟「不得其門而入，得其門者或寡矣」，豈非一件太不平的事麽？</p>
<p>最後、敎部在取締不良私中之前，希望積極地能創辦出幾個完善的學校來，否則·單是「取締」而不「建設」終非良策。無論何事，總得開一條可走的路讓人走上之後，才取締不良的荆棘之途才行！但建設不是一個簡單的問題，我們要建設便得澈底的建設，不是舊貨翻新的建設，目前的取締不良私中、祇是銷除壞的，但單是廢滅壞的還不是事，還要建設好的學校來！要建設好的學校須先要具體的認清社會，而加以正確地改革，否則敎育與社會，漠不相關，便失去辦敎育的本旨了。</p>
<h3>人約黃昏後</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>太陽還高高的掛在天空。</p>
<p>李大心兒裏像火燒，剛一條田垠鋤到頭，就抬起腦袋瞧天，瞧太陽，心思也不定，一想到那副滾圓的臉，豐腴的胳膞，手可軟啦，眼也那麽花，面前就像有阿金那樣一個惹景的姑娘，手伸過去，媽的，摸了個空。</p>
<p>釘耙揑在手裏，懶佯佯地鋤着，鋤着。泥塊跳，心也跳。再抬起腦袋瞧瞧太陽，累贅的傢伙哪，給釘住在天幕上似的，往常，天光很短，太陽一來就滾下山去。今天，却别扭兒地，老滾不下，冒火就得跳上天去把它摘下。</p>
<p>眞不是心思呵。</p>
<p>……「黃昏你在柏樹墳窠裏等」李大牢記着這句話丨從熱情的嘴裏，帶羞的神態中說的這句話。今天早上他在牛車棚邊遇見着阿金，她對他就祇說了一句，就漲紅了臉蛋兒，手指兒扔上去得冒血似的。</p>
<p>「媽的，滿肚子心事跟誰說？」李大這時候只巴望天夜，只巴望黃昏快點來到，他憧憬着黃昏的可愛。</p>
<p>想得出神的時候，便丢下釘耙，坐在土墩上，癡呆呆地。他有些時在心兒裏自言自語：「這麽大年紀啦，還没抬家婆，去年得一個熟年，穩想好幹親事了，偏偏外邊市面不好，外國進口的米麥把糧食市價壓低啦。什麽冬防捐，什麽保安捐，什麽公路費，横要化錢，豎要化錢，看下去，呌我性李的凖得打一世光棍。」</p>
<p>打一世光棍，不是空口說的白話，農村裏儘多着不討老婆的中年漢子，没錢哪，這勢口一個子養活一個子都不容易。可是，該家私的人該好幾個女人呢，姨太太，媽的，丢臉的姑娘統跟該錢的跑，吃的油，穿的綢，享福，呌她們自家兒的身體給癩蛤蟆吞，給人家當哈拜狗消悶，没血性的丨丨</p>
<p>可是，也有該烈性的呢。</p>
<p>不是嗎？就說阿金，她撓起指兒亦能算一個，幾次三番没上她表兄的鈎，她不愛白花花的洋錢，她不愛吃着，她不羨慕人家享福，她說過的丨丨</p>
<p>「鄕下的牛到了城市就得被殺掉給人當食料，給擠出乳來給該錢的人當補品，女娘兒跟牛差不多，爲什麽想念城市呢，在鄕下生活着不是很好嗎？做做吃吃，誰說不好啊！」</p>
<p>太陽滾到山凹邊的時候，李大便一骨碌打土墩上站起來，他想起了阿金對自已意外的深情，步子亦變輕鬆了，掮着釘耙，回到家，怱怱地洗凈脚，吃了兩花碗麥粥，他爹爹呌他搓麻繩，也没理，偷偷的跑開啦。</p>
<p>他睜大了眼珠子，獨個兒蹲在柏樹墳窠裏，一粒一粒火星子在村上閃動，月兒打西邊滾上天，遠遠地，高堤上走着個黑影丨丨越走越近。</p>
<p>「阿金丨」</p>
<p>「誰是阿金，小鬼，躱着没好事幹。」</p>
<p>「哦！小銀妹，捉只火螢蟲給你玩哪。」</p>
<p>「希罕你捉？」……</p>
<p>小銀妹走進村去了，李大揮了一把汗，又把視線轉向高堤，期待着丨丨</p>
<p>心兒裏這麽「黃昏呵！黃昏！」不息地在吟，吟……。</p>
<h3>女人的一般病</h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>時代總算是進化了。一向深鎖在閨房裏的中國女人，彷彿是另外一種人種似的，没有和漢子們在社會上事業上相見的機會。於是就形成一種黛玉式的美人風尚，事實告訴我們，過去中國的女人是給男子洩慾的，傳種接代的，此外一無足言。可是時代畢竟進化了辛亥以後，中國的女人已打起了與漢子們抗衡的旗面，年復一年，經過這二十多年的呐喊，到而今，女人也好像排成了一個陣列。看啦，有女委員，有女縣長，有女秘書，有女官佐，有女警察，哪一行没有哪？</p>
<p>是的，這是時代進化的表徵！這是女人進化的福音！女權伸張的光榮！該是多麽地值得我們讚頌呵！</p>
<p>然而，可惜的，事實竟是那麽地歪曲！雖說有的是女委員女縣長等，也不過是伊們在悠悠的歷史上的一點點綴，一種微乎其微的個人發展，對於整個的女界，並不曾樹立一種風範。換句話說，現在大多數的女人，還未擺脫過去的舊彀，祇不過在皮毛上加了一番新的粉飾，雖然儼然像是有了偌大的進步，骨子裏則還是那麽一種髓份。</p>
<p>嚴格的說來，現在的女人病態，也就是錯誤，實較從前爲尤甚。只要看從女人而引起的糾紛之多，就可想見一般。此類事實，每日佔了新聞紙的大幅，觸目皆是，毋庸細舉。</p>
<p>我們且來分析一下看看。</p>
<p>（一）虚榮心的高漲丨丨過去中國的女人，雖說是男人的附屬品，倒也没有多少虚榮心，所謂「嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗，」眞是一幅逼眞的繪畫，伊們除了憑天吃飯，憑天安排生命而外，就没有别的了。現在的可就兩樣了，最顯著的莫過於虚榮心的高漲，無論對於甚麽事，只求其虚榮之滿足，其他就都可以不顧了。比方在求學的時期，十個女生有九個當分數的奴隸，拼命向敎員爭，只要分數最多，實際的學識，倒不在伊們的意下。參加運動，也是爲了觀衆的喝采。離開學校以後，做太太亦務必問有無家實，有無勢力。這都是虚榮心使之而然。</p>
<p>（二）奴隸性的保持丨丨雖說現在已是男女平等，男女同樣在社會上服務。但因爲伊們虚榮心的高漲，究竟是不能打開獨立的出路，樹立獨立的人格。所以求學或在閨的時期，且不去遠究。一到畢業後嫁隨了男人，就充分的顯露出奴隸性了，伊們原來視出嫁就是職業，物質生活，精神生活都以結婚來解决。所以一個現代的女子，一結婚伊的生命也就完了。只知在丈夫面前撒嬌獻媚，以博其歡心、别的都可不管。這種奴隸性的演出，實在是女運的唯一致命傷。</p>
<p>（三）亨樂慾望很强丨丨根據第一項的錯誤，因爲虚榮心很重，而又只會作「寄生蟲，」自已談不到生産，當然就只知道亨受，亨受也罷，偏還要慾望很强，一味的朝向「樂」的方面猛進，十足的暴露出了女人的病徵。如此下去，怎不墮入陷阱，遭人踐踏呢？更怎不隳喪自已的人格？摧殘女運的發展？</p>
<p>女人們，時代告訴我們，這絶不是你們的出路，醒醒吧！</p>

<h3>黃浦江畔夜景</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>黑夜的幕序，已展向人間：夏末的晚風，已帶來了温柔的凉意。街頭的電炬，突然地放了光明，霓虹燈也吐出了它的紅熖。彷彿是一條萬道金光的金蛇，儘在空中舞蕩：只照耀得街頭巷梢都像白晝一樣，人，車，在街中交織成了一片，女的挽着男的，男的追着女的，似怒潮一般的在馬路中洶湧，澎湃，激盪。</p>
<p>黃浦江畔，江海關上的大鐘，轟立在空際：它似乎並没感覺到夏天裏的太陽和冬天裏的西北風一樣的可怕！祗日夜不息地幹着它報時的職務。那和平之神，它只孤獨地站在江邊垂涙！</p>
<p>路傍，錯落的樹間，點綴着一盞盞幽暗的燈光：江風打上了人們的臉，感到好一些微熱。來往的電車，每一輛都是載得滿滿的，兜風的汽車，也都開足了馬達，在道中啣接着，如飛一般的駛着。市渡輪的碼頭上，擠滿了人；男的，女的；售票處的角子洋錢聲音是叮叮噹噹的響着。「嘟！嘟！」兩聲汽笛，輪船離開了碼頭，帶着一船乘凉遊湖人們，衝着激浪，向吳淞疾駛去。這裏給遺下一羣人衆，祇得張大着羨慕的眼光，痴望着它漸漸地消滅在繁星點點的烟波裏。</p>
<p>晚潮漲進了浦江，浪花激着岸邊，發出清脆的濤聲，彷彿婺婦的哭泣，病人的呻吟；那末凄楚，那末態凉！</p>
<p>望到對江，零落的燈光，眞好像黑夜天上的繁星一般的美麗，一般的幽靜。不過，那裏還隱約地襯托着一些建設物的影子，幾隻帝國主義者唯一的侵略武器！兵艦！在江心中兀然的停着。</p>
<p>江邊的草坪上，臥着許多給熱趕在屋子外的勞苦大衆，一排一排地像吃了敗仗的傷兵。這裏，在他們眼中看來，也許是和廬山，莫干山，一樣的消夏勝地呢。</p>
<p>外灘公園的門裏，流進了一羣一羣的人：椅子上，草地上，已没有了一絲空隙的地方。在樹蔭的蔽護下，有捉厮對兒的偎着擁着：園的中央，放滿了售冷飲的籐桌籐椅，無綫電奏出了異國的情調，爛酬的水手，挽着「鹹水妹」的臂兒，横衝直撞的在人行道中走着，哼着獅吼般的音調，一股帶了異味的酒氣，中人欲嘔，人們都遠遠地向他們避開，但他們那貪婪的眼光，却儘放射在中國的漂亮女子身上。</p>
<p>草地上，燈光的暗處，直僵僵的躺着丨好些人身傍都坐着一個女人，不知細細地在說些什麽？</p>
<p>那裏也有不少小小羅曼斯的喜劇在扮演着，也許，吾這末忖度着。</p>
<p>一輪殘缺不圓整的明月，好像處女樣的嬌翔、把一個臉兒畏縮地透出了水平綫漸漸地升到了天空，散出了萬丈銀光，將一個渾濁的黃浦江，照得似澄滿了水銀一樣，美麗的漪波，隨着風兒的擺動，那皎潔的光輝，浸潤了每一個人的心田，勾起了無限的，不可思議的幻想。</p>
<h3>天曉得集</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>有序</p>
<p>（天曉得）三字久已習爲一般國人之口頭禪，其意甚明，其來頭則渺不可考。「我的朋友」（？）胡適之又遠在北平，否則我當登門冒昧請敎一番，寫起來也當有「精」有「采」，值錢得多。但是題目已定，就要貨色上紙，迫不及待，只得「朦朧」一談。好在其意旣明，讀者又多賢明，不難摩儗得之。「天曉得」者，有類乎「莫明其妙」也。是算序。</p>
<p>日昨掌敎務的同事Ｘ君對我說：「這裏的學生的程度眞是差得使人發噱，有一個高中畢業生來取證書，我交過去要他出具一張簡便的收條，他竟說不會寫，要我代勞。」……</p>
<p>另一方面，暑假以來，北平各校本屆畢業生，類多無路可走，乃發起職業運動，繼之而起者有南京中大，本埠曁大，此一運動之發生，我自始就特别注意着，似還僅有一片喊聲，没有什麽結果。大學畢業生好容易造就？照理應該是最有用的最高人材了，事實上竟忙着喊出路，眞使人見了胡塗發瘋。</p>
<p>這事之演出，算是中國敎育破産的一個總清算，也是社會到了極度破落的表徵，我除了連呼幾聲「天曉得」外，確實别無道理可講。</p>
<p>上海的社會，特别是這樣的大熱季節，值得我們注目的事，格外的多。每早掀開報紙，把社會新聞欄看看，總要發見一二駭人聽聞的奇蹟。直捷點，你到馬路上去觀光觀光，更隨時有着使你見了心傷的事。不信，且看我說來：</p>
<p>晚邊，寒家的女孩子逃出蒸籠似的擱樓或亭子間，想到弄堂口透一口比較風凉的氣，該是毋須懷着「千金之子坐不垂堂」的戒心，却也有天外的横禍飛來。就是有些癟三癟四之徒，他不管你的年紀還止有五歲或六歲，慢說發育成年，他只要有着機會丨丨没人在旁，見你孤單，就要向你找性的排洩的出處。於是便演成强姦Ｘ歲幼女判罪的新聞。</p>
<p>大熱天，冷飲利市十倍冰淇淋啦，刨冰啦，各種汽水啦，一瓶又一瓶的在有錢人的嘴邊送下。但馬路上却有着不少的苦力，在拾着别人食完丢棄地上的西瓜皮（請注意眞正是西瓜皮！）一塊一地塊的在咬着，彷彿凉氣沁心，又可果腹，味道無窮似的。有時候還三五個在搶着，閙成大風波。</p>
<p>黃包車夫赤着膞，赤着脚，爲了要飯吃，肯低價拉人在火般的太陽下飛奔。坐車的人，穿着蟬翼般的綢，紗衣，頭上還打着傘，手裏還不停的揮着扇，「熱，熱，第三個還是要命的熱」，在他她們的口裏斯斯文文的迸出來。</p>
<p>閘北大洋橋潭子灣一帶，入晚以後，渾似「裸體團」，孩子們不待說每個都脫得精光，連成年漢子及婦人也多是一絲不掛，馬路邊就是他們天成的大牀。於是疾病時作，没錢理會，死亡相繼，闊人充耳不聞。</p>
<p>這些，這些，都算做是「天曉得」。</p>

<h3>病中瑣語</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>一個人在失戀的時候是痛苦的在失意的時候是痛苦的，在不生不死的生活環境裏面是痛苦的，在罹病的時候是痛苦的，在孤另另地一個子患着病而没有朋友，親戚，愛人，來照料和安慰的時候更是痛苦的；這痛苦是深深的銘鐫在我的腦海裏，肺腑中，血液的流動裏！</p>
<p>這痛苦，是一種悲哀無援的痛苦，是一種殘酷的痛苦，是一種没有感情的大痛苦！由這些的痛苦中，我經騐了不少人生的敎訓與本質。由這些的痛苦中，我認識了許許多多寶貴的做人的法門！</p>
<p>對於自已孤寂的悲哀，曾經掀動我一綫愁絲，在靜穆的深夜裏，用我一隻瘦弱的手肘住我的由於苦思焦慮而引起精神劇痛的腦袋，由室中慘淡底燈光的燭照下，我懷看一顆悽愴的心情，用一種慘然的態度，由我一隻充滿了傷涙的眼睛凝望開去，窗外也是黯淡的，蕭瑟的，沉悶的，是個灰色的夜啊！彷彿和我的心境一樣。</p>
<p>天空雖然是佈滿了些星光，伴着一鈎娥眉般的殘月，然而這景緻，不但是不會引起我贊美的情緒，反而，對於一個正爲病魔所糾纒正和孤獨抗爭的人，這是多麽不幸的啊！</p>
<p>由於疾病的苦痛而引起一個人的意識上的變化是可怕的，危險的，甚至在無可奈何中會令我走上一條毁滅之路啊！</p>
<p>這時，在我的心裏，頓然湧起一種尋死的念頭，我感覺爲了生而白白要挨這塲難堪的痛苦，不如死了爲妙！死不是一切痛苦的終結嗎？</p>
<p>眼睜睜的候着死，眼睜睜的讓病魔在自已的身上任意忘行，踐躍蹂躪，這是絶對不能忍容的嗎？我的身體，這時，雖然不能和牠抵抗，但我的精神可要與牠拚命的。</p>
<p>死是絶對不可避免的了。是的，我寗願快點把自已的生命結束了去。像那樣的活着畢竟是没有什麽好處的。</p>
<p>對於人們的援助我感覺不需要了。因爲我明白援助的背後是隱伏着一種卑鄙的企圖。所以，爽捷地還是不要同誰求援助吧！</p>
<p>至於憐憫，對我是侮辱，我不受任何人憐憫。虔誠的安慰，固然是一種崇高的同情，但這同情並不輕易流露的。可是，那些虚僞的叮嚀，假作的熱情，敷衍的態度，我塞着自已的耳朶，閉着自已的眼睛，我萬分層惡那些僞情假義的傢伙！</p>
<p>在病中，我切實地了解了朋友，感情的眞僞，康健時的幸福，苦痛時的滋味。</p>
<p>在病中，我領略過了人的欺騙，人的漠然，人的殘酷，人類自私，人的暴戾，人的卑鄙，人的野性……</p>
<p>在病中，我感覺人是多麽無聊和下賤的動物呵！讓痛苦與災難蝕食了一個可以挽救的生命，這不能不說是人的無理及殘暴了。</p>

<h3>脾氣改變</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生！</p>
<p>我有位朋友他有椿進退兩難的事情同我說起，並很需要解决它，可是以一個才疏學淺的我，怎能解决這困難的事情呢！因此來懇煩先生。</p>
<p>我這位朋友他現在念三歲，在十五歲的時候，就棄求學去做事情了，因他品行善良，辦事謹愼，很蒙業師賞識，經過了二年的觀察，在十七年一年就由業師介紹，替他訂婚，他所訂的女了，就是師母姊姊的女兒。兩邊時常往返，大家都很熟悉，這女子也時常到他們家裏去，有時候就在他家宿了一夜，或小住數日。在這過渡時代，這婚姻是很好的，可是最近根據我這位朋友說，這女子很使他失望，我便根究他，你怎樣知道的。他說：「在一二八滬戰的時候，她曾在我家住了好幾天，因日常住在一處的緣故，因此就很容易觀察出了；她脾氣的惡劣，無以復加，人很貪小不大方！又懶惰成性，不知自愛。我的家庭也很鄙視她，（因她曾做過不端的事情）倘使娶過來之後，不但無恩愛可言，反而雙方感情惡劣有什麽意思呢？並且家庭的感情也要破裂，所以我這位朋友非常憂煩，終日在愁城中過日，現在提出兩條問題，請先生答復：一，倘使說他不願同她結婚，當然是解約，那應採取什麽步驟，需要什麽方法，她不願意怎樣。二，如果不同她解約，採取什麽方法，使她脾氣改變，人做好。上面這二個問題急迫地需要先生替他解决，敬祝撰安愚上</p>
<p>答：你的朋友在現在對於對方的印象旣是如此惡劣，當然還是解約好。解約的方法是很簡單的：他可直接向對方表示，或由原媒傳達他要解約的意思，現在婚約的效力很薄弱，如果他的意志很堅决，對方是無法强制，不過對方是可以向他請求損害賠償的。第二點，用什麽方法使她的脾氣變好，這問題是很難解答的。因爲一個人的脾氣品性，固非是天生如此，主要的是由環境所養成，但是一經養成之後，就很難改革，卽俗說「江山好改，本性難易」是也。不過脾氣也不是不能更改的，一個人也不是不能做「好」，你朋友的未婚妻脾氣品性，不好·依我看來，在概是所受敎育惡劣，缺乏知識的原故，所以，他如果要希望她「人做好」，不妨從敎育方面着手試試看。</p>

<h3>呆子（二）</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>孩子們圍繞着他，像玩弄猴戲班裏的猴子一樣地玩弄着他：有些拾了路邊的石子擲他：有些用母親給他們的炒豆哄他：有幾個父親開小南貨店的孩子從嘴裏摸出滑溜的棗乾核子打他。他們頓着小脚，哼着小嘴，做着手勢，異口同聲地發出急雨的雨點似的諷嘲：</p>
<p>「呆子，阿要老婆？」</p>
<p>「細毛相的阿囡要嗎，呆子？」</p>
<p>「梅花圖，竹管脚，眞好看哪！要不要？」</p>
<p>他那浮漾着被壓迫者的無可奈何的悲哀的獰笑的圓臉上立時閃着希望的光芒，從厚笨的雙唇間發出疑信參半的回音：</p>
<p>「老婆自然要囉。眞的嗎？在那兒呀？帶我去看，去，去呀！」</p>
<p>孩子們笑得轉不過氣來，像肚皮痛似的彎着身子。</p>
<p>「諾，就是他呀！抱去拜堂吧。」指着路邊的狗。</p>
<p>於是失望，悲哀和憤怒交織在他的毛臉上，雙唇不斷地掀動，顯然在咀嚼着「苦痛」的滋味。</p>
<p>然而正如一切慣被踐踏，被玩弄呆子們的有時竟使聰明人不得不暫時把自已兇惡的臉相隱藏在温和親切的微笑之中，隱藏在包着白糖的砒霜丸一樣的小惠之中，而爲的是要更殘酷地踐踏他們，玩弄他們。我們這個呆子也有表面上非常馨香的時候，也有無須向人求乞而可以獲得求乞不到的食物的時候，也有孩子們在大人的斥責之下不敢玩弄他的時候，不過他在接受這種破格的待遇後所付出的代價，自然也不是僅僅給人們不癢不痛地喝幾聲，笑駡幾聲，甚至打幾個只給以瞬時的小小的痛楚的耳光所可同日而語了。</p>
<p>每當天空掛着迷濛的雨網，路上點綴着小小的水潭的時候，一切没有男人的，或男人不會挑水或懶於在雨天挑水的人家的婦女，就不約而同地想起了呆子。她們先把各自的水缸刮得乾乾凈凈，有些嫌水缸太小，還另外預備好一口空缸，於是就靠在臨街的樓窗上，或直立在大門口，切熱地察聽着呆子的嚘聲，像期待着聲香的貴客一樣地期待着呆子。</p>

<h3>論反戰影片及其姿態</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>假使我們不是瞎子，假使我們不願做帝國主義的順民，目前帝國主義備戰之狂熱，已經到了瘋狂的地步，該是我們不敢忽視的吧。</p>
<p>關於這一方面的事實，幾乎是有勝枚舉。美國海軍在太平洋大西洋的會操，英國是拼命的擴大海軍，法國的軍事預算的空前的增加，意國建造了許多三萬噸以上的軍艦以及鐵翼蔽空的飛機的遠征，德國希特拉極力堅持軍備平等而擴大他的秘密步隊，日本的積極進攻華北以及不斷的向蘇聯挑戰，……這些事實，還不够說明帝國主義之瘋狂的備戰嗎？</p>
<p>最近，由於奥總理陶爾斐斯的死，凡爾賽體系和反爾賽體系之尖銳的對立，進一步而爲正面的衝突，意大利甚至於以武力干涉爲要脅，法國的不讚成巴本爲駐奥公使，諸如此類的事實，戰爭的爆發隨時都有可能。</p>
<p>而另一方面，由於蘇聯的社會主義建設之猛進，對照着歐美國家一從戰後的相對穩定走向最後崩潰之階段，迫近了戰爭與革命的大門：兩個世界的對立，已促成東方和西方的積極進攻蘇聯的陣綫。英國代替了法國而成爲波蘭，羅馬尼亞等臣屬國之組織者，德國的外交大臣公開宣言瓜公蘇聯，日本在東北邊境間牒戰之活躍，無一不是表示新十字軍之積極的成長。但是直到現在還没有軍事行動之發動，一方面固然因着帝國主義之間的根本矛盾難於消滅，而另一方面各國國内的不安，革命勢力之成長，也是主要的原因。現在已是戰爭與革命的新週期，以革命戰爭消滅帝國主義戰爭，乃是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>那末，在這狂風暴雨之夜，反映到電影上來是些什麽呢？在德國，在日本，在意大利，因爲法西斯蒂本身，就是戰爭的原故，我們看到他們是以電影來組織戰爭，歡迎戰爭。同樣，在美國也不會例外、從許多新聞片中，從許多以戰爭爲題材的影片中，我們更可看到製片者對於戰爭的狂熱。</p>
<p>但是，我們爲了擁護世界和平，特别是在半殖民地的中國，爲了不使中國不致成爲第二次大戰的戰塲，爲了保障不死於毒瓦斯炸彈之下而爲帝國主義的砲灰，我們得以全力來反對大戰，因此我們得在電影上來完成我們的使命，製作反戰的影片。</p>
<p>自然，我們所要求的决不僅僅是人道主義觀念的厭惡戰爭影片爲止，更進一步的，我們要正確的分析大戰的本質，而說明帝國主義大戰的原因及其結果。而且在中國，反戰影片之製作，决不能和反帝抗日之發動的影片相抵觸。我們反對帝國主義大戰，但是我們却要有組織反帝抗日的民族革命戰爭的影片多量的産生。正確的說，祗有發動民族戰爭，才能消滅帝國主義在戰，才能取得中國勝利的前途。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「柳暗花明」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｈeads　We　Go！丨國泰</p>
<p>所謂劇情的曲折離奇在歐美的製片商人的信念中佔極主要的地位，乃是無可否認的事實。就因爲如此，編劇家就得妙想天開的製造一些稀奇古怪的Story，至於通不通的問題，乃是他們所不必顧及的。</p>
<p>「柳暗花明」，就是在如此情形之下勉强製作出來的。劇情的不合乎情理，這不獨是少女裴娣因貌與明星桃樂姗凱相似而冒充，不爲我們所敢置信，而當眞桃樂珊凱之經紀人之在遊船會遇着假桃樂賽凱的時候，祗消當衆宣佈一下，馬上便會揭破此中秘密的。而大少爺會化裝茶房或查票，也是不會有的事。</p>
<p>故事旣然如此不通，那末其非表現眞實，乃是顯而易見的事實。而在這中間劇作者是怎樣爲他們階級而服務的呢？小家碧玉的裴娣，偶然遇着一個大少爺，立刻在三分鐘内便相愛想來。而就在唆使她們向上爬的主題之下，她看見他一變而爲茶房，不開心，但在遊船會上他變爲盛宴的主人，突然開心起來，再當他在火車上變爲查票員的時候，又使她驚奇了，結果她到底知道了他確是新聞巨頭的少爺，於是她和他眞誠（？）相愛了。丨丨全部是歪曲而笨拙的說敎。</p>
<p>當然，這樣的劇本，不怕導演是怎樣高明，也不會有好的收穫的，何况導演人ＭontyＢanks又不能極聰慧的在形式上取得某種程度的成功。這比之「一夜風流」的導演佛蘭克卡勃拉「ＦrankCapra），能够作爲一個說謊者，將荒誕不經的故事演述得使人幾乎相信起來，「柳暗花明」的導演却是相差太遠的。</p>
<p>也許可以這樣說，這裏並没有十分過不去的地方，他多少總是依據着不通的故事而盡了他的責任，但有些塲面是拍默片而後配音樂，連畫面上應有的鼓掌聲或者是跳舞塲的人們說話聲，都没有了。其次如裝腔作勢的噱頭，也是給我們生厭的。</p>
<p>女主角康斯丹克明（Ｃonstancs）的演技却並不高明，雖然她同時扮了兩個角色也把握了兩種個性。</p>
<p>其餘諸人，都屬平平。</p>
<h3>「以貌取人失之子羽」海倫海絲的初出</h3>
<p>— 馨之</p>
<p>以前電影明星都依靠了，「美容院」而生存的。但現在的電影界裏，面貌的美麗，已不甚希罕了。較面貌的美麗更重要的，是聲香和表情。這也是聲片和默片的轉變而起的變遷吧。</p>
<p>試看今日一般大明星，除了幾個例外，都不很美麗的。她們面貌非但平凡，有許多竟更在平凡之下。但是她們具有活潑和型成的姿態，足以爲一現代明星。</p>
<p>海倫海絲是這一流演員中的先進。　没有美麗的姿色。她也從没攷究過修飾。她成功一個現代的大明星，完全因爲她有藝術上高超的技能。</p>
<p>海倫海絲初到好萊塢，幾度的試騐，導演和攝影師等見了她的瘦小的面孔，呆滯的眼睛，一些引不起對於女性美的印象。她第一部片了，祇拍了一小半就中止了。她經過了幾次的投效，都告失敗。最後才轉到米高梅公司。她在米高梅攝影塲裏試騐的時候，導演和攝影師亦都暗中摇頭。</p>
<p>「她恐怕會趕走戲院裏的觀衆的」。米高梅的總經理依爾文柴爾伯向首席導演愛德加沙爾文說。沙爾文靜靜地瞧了她許久，覺得她缺乏妖艶的外觀，不足爲電影演員。於是他主張到柴爾伯的家中去再試她一試。</p>
<p>當沙爾文佈置好了一個試演室之後，他向柴爾伯說：「請你閉了眼睛，用耳朶來聽她的試演工作」，柴爾伯閉了眼睛，他靜聽海倫的試演，那邊已經開始在表演了。她的對白，顫抖的聲浪，足以感人情緒的語調，更有許多動人的尾聲，使人心緒驚動了。</p>
<p>柴爾伯張開了他的眼睛，眼眶中已滴出了涙珠。他望了望海倫，忘記了他面貌的平常，覺得她是一個很動人的女子。從此海倫竟中了雀屏之選，做了許多名片的主角。一九三二年的電影科學藝術研究會的榮譬奬，也歸了她。她面貌並不美，但她的地位却極高！</p>
<h3>「大地」的新訊一束</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>關於「大地」攝影隊回美而後，導演海爾的表示，已在本刋爲讀者報告。在這裏所報告的，是另外一些關於大地的新消息。</p>
<p>大地的攝影隊離華回美而後，雖已有幾星期之久，但演員和對白兩個問題，却值到現在還没有解决。</p>
<p>導演喬治海爾雖在中國拍攝了不少的外景，但演員表呢，却值到現在還未定當。中國的女演員、美國的明星，他雖已實地考騐過，然而幾星期來，這問題依然没有解决。</p>
<p>美國的影迷，一致的說中國人在銀幕上不能表演出劇中人的情緒，但海爾在中國，看見過中國演員在銀幕上的表情，包括他所考騐過的對於此說已完全表示不確。同時更回想到雷門諾伐羅和漢倫海絲到東方來拍攝ＳonDaughter一片，並没有十二分的滿意。</p>
<p>但我們從另一方面說來，好萊塢的男女明星，表演東方的角色，過去也很多有過相當的成功，像利却特巴斯曼司在“ＢrokenBlossoms”中，愛德華魯濱孫在“ＴheHatchetMlan”中，華納奥蘭特和尼爾阿斯德也曾做過同樣的角色，此外羅潑范爾滋。茂那洛埃，和漢侖海絲也曾做過東方的女人，這些便是由西方人表演東方的角色。</p>
<p>關於對白方面，有人覺得「愛斯基摩」的攝製技巧，用土語而附以英語的字幕說明，完全可引用到「大地」上比較，完全用英語要妥當得多，雖然自有種種的困難。</p>
<p>爲解决上面這兩個問題起見，現在正在考慮對白用兩種。一種英語，一種華語。將來在東方開映，使用華語，而在西方便用英語。至於演員也用兩班，中國人和美國人各攝一片云。</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（Ｂorn　to　be　kissed）（十一）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>湯姆走了之後，潘某還是站着不動，腦筋裏面，深思重重。一回兒他走到大餐廳的門口，把他的秘書紐白蘭小姐扛了出來。他吩咐她去把地方檢察官找了來。紐白蘭小姐一聽嚇了一跳，連忙問出了什麽亂子了。潘其道：「出了一個小小的亂子。那個疵心妄想的女子，勾結了我的兒子，我要想法處置她一下。」他用的什麽法子呢？那祗有他那詭計多端的腦筋想得出來。這時候湯姆已經回到憶迪和吉第合住的小公庽裏。他們正在興高彩烈的時候，不知天羅地網已經擺佈好了，靜待甕中捉鼈了。起初憶迪還有些不相信。但是湯姆告訴她說：「我和我的父親，已經講明白了。他祗要我快活，什麽都可以辦得到的。」他又將和他父親談話的情形，一一講給她聽了，她這才相信。湯姆并且稱呼她爲湯姆潘其夫人，弄得憶迪快樂得心肝賽貝直喊。她說：「我也要做許多事情：我的英文，我要請位先生重新敎一下……我亦還要讀些法文……我以後洗頭髮，亦不再用檸汗了……」湯姆不等她再往下說，就對着她的嘴唇一吻，就把她的話封住了。一回她又說道：「我的衣着，以後要力求簡單些……像你們在棕櫚海濱的那些朋友一樣……我們起初能不能兩個人總在一起呢？」湯姆唿着她道：「寶貝，當然可以的。你放心好了。」他說了，然後告訴她，他還要回到他父親的宴會上去。他說：「這是我末一次」個人到的地方了。我明天一早就打電話給你。一切的事情，我會呌牧師替我們料理好的。」憶迪好像還有些害怕似的抱住了他的手問道：「湯姆，一切都是眞的嗎？」湯姆又吻着她，安慰她道：「甜心，你放心好了。一切都是眞的。你去好好睡覺吧，明天還要辛苦一天哩。」</p>
<p>湯姆走了之後，憶迪心中很愉快地脫去了衣服，坐在床上。吉第和一個水手，一開出去玩去了。憶迪因爲太高興了，要坐着等吉第回來了，告訴她一切的喜訊哩。忽然有人在外面敲着門，憶迪連忙披了一件衣服下床問是誰。外面没有人答廳，她就將門開了一條縫張張。不料一個男子一隻脚已經伸了進來。他將門推開了。他跑了進來，拿門又關了起來，並且將鑰匙旋轉過去將門鎖了。他然後將上身衣服脫去了。憶迪嚇得狂喊，但是那個人却看着她儘笑，隔了一回，門外又有人敲門並且敲得很急。那個男子就去開門。門一開，外面站着一個警察，後面還跟着一個。前面的警察說道：「我們要看憶迪小姐。那先進來的男子，將手搭在憶迪肩膀上說道：「你們有公事没有？」憶迪莫名其妙的將那男子的手推開去，可是那男子却將她摟住了說道：「甜心，你不要害怕，有我在這裏。」憶迪對着那警察狂喊道：「誰個人是誰？我不認識他！」但是那個警察，却祇笑而不答地往旁邊一讓，後面走上來一個攝影師，將他們的相攝了去……憶迪穿的是睡衣，那個陌生男子，亦祗穿着一件襯衫，並且臂膀搭在憶迪的肩膀上！那攝影師拍了照，還很調皮的說了一聲：「這好極了，謝謝你們二位。」於是那位警察先生，大踏步地走到憶迪的面前喝道：「把衣服穿上。跟我們走吧！」他們把憶迪帶走了。（未完）</p>

<h3>President Wang's Ship Voyage to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>May Arrive in Lushan Tonight to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Huang Fu to Visit Soon Too</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang, in response to Chiang's invitation, went to Lushan to lecture the military officers corps. At 3:20 PM on the 8th, he traveled by car from the Ministry of Railways official residence to the naval wharf, arriving at 3:35 PM. He boarded the Hai Rong warship on the Jiesheng auxiliary vessel and set sail westward at 4:00 PM. Accompanying him were Wang's eldest son, naval commander Chen Shaokuan, railway vice-minister Zeng Zhongming, and six or seven staff members. Vice Foreign Minister Xu Mo, Tang Youren, section chief Li Shengwu, counselor Liang Yunli, director of the Beining Railway Bureau Yin Tong, naval vice-minister Chen Jiliang, and others all came to the wharf to see him off. Before departing, Wang met with Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, who had just returned to Nanjing from Qingdao, and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren at the official residence. Upon arriving at the wharf, he instructed Tang to contact Yin Tong and inform Chairman Huang to go to Lushan for a meeting. Wang told reporters at the wharf that he was going to lecture the summer military officers corps and discuss matters with Chairman Chiang, with a planned return to Nanjing on the 12th. Chairman Huang has decided to go to Lushan, and is expected to depart from Moganshan today or tomorrow. According to Chen Shaokuan, the Hai Rong warship should arrive at Xunyang (Jiujiang) by 3:30 PM on the 9th. From Xunyang to Lushan, it would take about two to three hours. It is estimated that they can arrive in Lushan on the evening of the 9th to meet Chiang. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong said that Chairman Huang has decided to pass through Nanjing to Lushan to meet with Chiang and Wang to discuss future strategies for dealing with North China. He himself has no definite date to return as Minister Gu is returning to Nanjing. He may be going to another place in the next few days. In other news, it is reported that Huang Fu recently wired Nanjing, saying that due to unfinished private matters, he must delay his departure from the mountain by one day, but will arrive in Nanjing no later than the 9th. It is heard that the Ministry of Navy has dispatched a warship to wait for Huang's arrival in Nanjing, after which he will travel west. Yin Tong will also accompany Huang to Xunyang to meet Chiang and report on the Dalian meeting. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>

It is heard that Huang is scheduled to leave Moganshan for Nanjing on the 15th or 16th, then travel to Jiangxi to meet Chiang, after which he can come to Beiping. At that time, there will be new progress on all issues. The handover of Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs is not far off. Regarding the negotiations for the return of Chahar East, the Japanese side has agreed, but the handover date must be after concrete solutions are reached on all issues in the war zone.

In preparation for a potential war against the Soviet Union, the Japanese side has designated the Fushun coal mine as a fuel supply point and a lifeline for national defense. They will also hold a large-scale air defense exercise in mid-October, with the participation of the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft, the Fushun coal mine security team, the youth corps, and various Fushun agencies. The exercise will last for a week, with the hypothetical enemy being the Russian air force. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the recent widespread rumors in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan that British soldiers were injured by stray bullets from Japanese troops, all investigations have proven this to be false. According to a telegram from Shanhaiguan, the truth is that British troops stationed in Shanhaiguan were prevented by Japanese troops from going to the east of the Great Wall for field exercises in late last month. The British commander stated that the area outside the Great Wall is part of Chinese territory, and according to the Boxer Protocol, the stationing of troops here cannot be abandoned due to the prevention of military exercises, which has led to negotiations. Whether a resolution has been reached is still uncertain. During this period, two British soldiers went missing, leading to many suspicious rumors and gossip. They were found in Qinhuangdao on the 4th and reported to be unharmed. The rumors of Japanese soldiers killing British soldiers then arose between Qinhuangdao, and inquiries were made. All were told that the matter was unfounded, and they departed. (Special dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<h3>Emergency Measures for the Silk Industry by Tong</h3>
<p>Recently, silk mills in Shanghai, having just resumed operations, have been hit by the impact of a sharp drop in silk prices, so much so that they may not be able to continue operating. At the critical juncture for the cotton textile industry, the city is again facing a silk industry panic. It is truly a turbulent autumn for China's industrial sector. From the perspective of the mills, the standard for resuming silk mill operations must be entirely dictated by the silk price market. However, in reality, the recent sharp drop in silk prices is unprecedented. Before stable measures can be implemented, a mill shutdown is inevitable. As for the stability of the workers' livelihoods, they are completely in a passive position. The suffering they endure is naturally even greater. When the silk mills in Shanghai resumed operations this year, the city authorities saw that the number of employed workers was only one-tenth or one-twelfth of that in previous years. It was inevitable that workers would compete for jobs. Therefore, to maintain order and provide relief to the workers, the municipal government submitted a report to the central government, requesting that it take measures. On the government side, regarding fundamental solutions, eleven fundamental measures to save the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been drafted. Regarding emergency measures, there are also four measures to relieve the Shanghai silk industry. This shows that the government is paying attention to the future of the silk industry.</p>
<p>In recent years, the collapse of China's silk industry has been undeniable. What are the reasons for this? It is worth examining. Some people attribute the decline of the silk industry to the misguided investment policies of the banking industry, saying that investing in government bonds and real estate is the main reason for hindering the progress of industry and disregarding the rural economy. This neglects the decline in Chinese silk technology, the global recession, and the dumping policies of the Japanese. We know that China's silk exports have fallen drastically by 67 percent, from 282.2 million yuan in 1928 to 93 million yuan in 1933. However, during the same period, the sales of natural silk in the world market did not fall in the same proportion. This fully proves that the rapid collapse of the domestic silk industry is greatly affected by the expansion of production capacity in other silk-producing countries, especially the dumping of Japanese silk. Amid the current global economic panic, countries with advanced productivity are trying their best to monopolize the world market. Chinese silk, with its inferior quality, naturally has no choice but to fail. Originally, China is a semi-colonial country. The entire domestic industrial sector is fundamentally controlled by imperialist forces. The current situation of the silk industry is just one example. However, because the silk industry has always been a major production sector for the nation, its collapse can have a wide range of impacts. First, the decline of the silk industry will inevitably make the lives of countless farmers even more miserable. Because if the silk industry is depressed, the price of cocoons will be worthless. The more the price of cocoons falls, the more the income of farmers will shrink, and the lower the standard of living will be. In this state of "death without a day," there is naturally no way to talk about improving production. Secondly, while the lives of farmers are becoming increasingly miserable, a large number of workers who depend on silk mills for a living are also experiencing great panic. For example, in Shanghai alone, there are as many as 80,000 silk mill workers. Since the number of employed workers is less than one-tenth or one-twelfth of that in previous years, the remaining 60,000 to 70,000 workers and their families have no choice but to wait for death. Thirdly, from the perspective of national finances, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas have always been the source of central government revenue, and the silk industry is a major source of income for farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Once the livelihoods of the vast majority of farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are severely affected, it will be difficult for them to continue to bear the national taxes and levies.</p>
<p>Since the silk industry panic has such a major impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is of course imperative to seek relief measures as soon as possible. We believe that the current situation is urgent. It is better to temporarily refrain from mentioning high-sounding and far-fetched measures. The third item in the government's previously determined emergency measures, "Expeditiously establish a silk industry control committee," even if it can be established immediately, will require a huge amount of 30 to 40 million yuan to be able to exert the effectiveness of control. So it is difficult to achieve in the short term. As for the first item, "Exempt all local cocoon and silk mill taxes and levies," and the second item, "Reduce transportation costs for mulberry seedlings and silk cocoons," at most, they are only passive remedies. It seems that the saving power will not be very great. The most important thing is the fourth item, "The Shanghai Municipal Government should first borrow funds and plan for funds or issue bonds to provide relief." It is found that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the two ministries of industry and finance have issued the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 20th year, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 21st year, for the relief of the silk industry, and have established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Old Silk and Old Cocoon Registration and Promotion Committees, all of which have achieved considerable results. However, the government has already incurred a heavy burden due to the issuance of silk industry bonds. Whether the Shanghai Municipal Government and even the Central Government have the courage to take responsibility for continuing to issue bonds to the silk mills in the shortest possible time is really a question. As for borrowing funds first and planning for funds, it is even more difficult. According to the opinion of the silk industry, the only emergency measure now should be to request the government to follow the precedent set in the 19th year for relieving the silk industry. For every picul of raw silk exported, the government should subsidize 100 yuan in foreign currency, or ask the government to designate a bank to accept pledges at a low interest rate to make the economy more flexible. This is a relatively easy measure. It is hoped that the government can live up to the expectations of the industry and overcome the current difficulties first. The livelihood of the unemployed workers is also taken care of. Then, quickly seek to control trade, production, and raw material prices, promote international markets, and improve silk industry technology.</p>
<p>Six Russian Airplanes</p>
<h3>Reporting on Diplomatic Exchanges with Paris and Rome</h3>
<p>Airfield Fluttering with Red Flags</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome at Official Venues</p>
<p>(Paris) Three Soviet Russian large aircraft, carrying the Soviet Russian Military Commission, flew from Moscow and landed safely today at the Le Bourget airfield. All three aircraft were green, with dark red propellers. Those on board were all in military uniform. The delegation was led by Ens, Director of the Soviet Russian Civil Aviation Administration, in response to the invitation extended to the Soviet Union last year by French Air Minister Gut. Upon landing, French Air Minister General Talrand welcomed them on the spot, and a French air squadron served as escort. Soviet Russian flags were visible everywhere in the field. The two sides exchanged modest words. Another Soviet Russian military aircraft squadron will land tonight at Rome's Ciampino airfield in response to the invitation extended to the Soviet Union by the Italian military aircraft. Numerous officials, including the Russian Ambassador to Rome, the Italian Aviation Ministry representative, and Italian Air Force officers, were present to welcome them. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Director of the Soviet Russian Civil Aviation Administration, Enshilito, and the Air Force Chief of Staff, Chrispin, led three aircraft from Moscow to Vienna yesterday, stayed overnight, and departed from Vienna again this morning, arriving at the Le Bourget airfield near Paris at 10:30 AM. Former Air Minister Gut, members of the Higher Aviation Committee, General Michoud, and many figures from the aviation community were present to welcome them. Personnel from the Soviet Russian Embassy and representatives of the Russian émigré community also came to greet them. At 10:35 AM, the three aircraft landed one after another. Former Air Minister Gut approached the aircraft and shook hands with the crew as a greeting. The pilots were all wearing khaki uniforms. After the aircraft stopped, they disembarked one by one, and several young women came forward to present flowers. Several Russian technicians, who had met former Air Minister Gut when he visited Russia last year, also came to France on this flight and spoke briefly with Gut. Gut then accompanied the Russian aviators to inspect the French air force squadron on the field. A very large red Soviet Russian flag was erected in the center of the airfield. After the inspection, the guests and hosts went to a nearby hangar for refreshments. General Michoud delivered a welcoming speech to the Soviet Russian aviators, saying that the French aviation community was deeply honored by the first visit of representatives from the Soviet Russian aviation community, and that the skill of Soviet Russian aircraft manufacturing and the composure of the pilots were highly admirable. Director of the Soviet Russian Civil Aviation Administration Enshilito gave a brief thank you speech in Russian. Shortly after, Enshilito went to a microphone and spoke again, his final words roughly expressing his hope that aviators from Russia and France could work together to achieve lasting peace. The crowd applauded in approval. After the speeches, the aviators boarded cars prepared by the Soviet Russian Embassy and the French government to rest at their hotels. The crowds cheered along the way. The aircraft used by the Soviet Russian aviators this time were all made of metal and were of the latest design. Although their structure was extremely sturdy, their form was very refined and commendable. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome. Former Italian Air Minister General Balbo led a squadron of aircraft to visit the Soviet Russian city of Odessa in 1929. The Soviet Russian government has now specially dispatched three large aircraft to Italy in return. They arrived at the airfield here at 7:30 PM. Those present to welcome them included Rome Air Defense Commander General Li Ruoda, Airfield Staff, General Belcchini, who had previously flown across the Atlantic, and personnel from the Soviet Russian Embassy in Italy. Each Soviet Russian aircraft had four engines. They stopped yesterday in Krakow, Poland, and resumed flying this morning. The leader of the aircraft squadron was General Erdmann, accompanied by five aviation generals, including the president of the Aviation Academy, the head of the driving school, and an aviation inspector. In addition, there were three Soviet Russian aircraft manufacturing technicians and 23 pilots. The fact that three aircraft could carry so many people indicates their large scale. After the aircraft landed, the military played music and paid respects as per custom, and then went to rest at the hotel. The stay in Italy is expected to last about a week. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Concentrated in Chita</h3>
<p>Stationed with 220 Aircraft</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian government in Manchuria has decided to station two elite destroyers, including the Speirdelrf, in Lake Baikal to serve as a guard, with Vilfanachiisk as its base. Russian ships sailing to Kulun. The stationing of warships in the lake is unprecedented. Furthermore, because Chita is now being used as the air force base for the western part of the Far East, eight hangars capable of accommodating 16 aircraft have been completed and are being expanded. In addition, one hundred and ten aircraft from Irkutsk have been moved to Chita, so there are now 220 aircraft stationed in Chita. (Dentsu, 8th)</p>
<p>Area Around Outer Mongolia</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Deployment</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The Soviet Russian government is gradually carrying out military work in Outer Mongolia. The Kulun scientific weapons manufacturing plant, which began this spring, was also commissioned on July 26 by Major General Willie Van Termoff, leading more than 30 technicians. It is rumored to start work in September. Furthermore, the military airfield in Kulun had a squadron of air force stationed there last year, and hangars have been expanded this spring by Outer Mongolia to accommodate 200 aircraft. Moreover, the 9th Air Force Detachment Commander, Platov, has led 21 bombers and 23 reconnaissance aircraft to be stationed in the hangar (Dentsu, 8th).</p>
<h3>British Empire Defense</h3>
<p>Sir Hankey, in the Name of the Cabinet Secretary</p>
<p>Visits Various Autonomous Territories for Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) Sir Hankey, a member of the Imperial Defence Committee, will set out on Friday to visit various autonomous territories to discuss imperial defence issues. Sir Hankey recently stated, "I will discuss everything with the governments of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada in the name of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretary of the Imperial Defence Committee." The purpose of Sir Hankey's trip is very broad. He has not received specific instructions or been assigned specific tasks. The emphasis is on discussing various issues, including economics, finance, commerce, military affairs, and strategy, with politicians in the autonomous territories, seeking their opinions, and informing them of the views of the British government. Of particular importance are the Ottawa Agreement and the issue of Imperial Defence. Regarding the Ottawa Agreement, some provisions have not been implemented by the autonomous territories or have not been fully implemented. Regarding Imperial Defence, the issue of protecting the Imperial sea lanes and naval bases in the Far East will inevitably be discussed. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Konoe's Opinion Letter</p>
<h3>Criticism from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs avoids formal discussions on Prince Konoe's opinion letter on the United States, a summary of criticisms from various departments within the ministry is as follows: (1) The opinion letter generally presents the current state of Japan-U.S. relations and the U.S. attitude toward Japan based on facts. In particular, regarding the Manchurian problem, it clearly indicates that although the U.S. broadly recognizes the reality, it still adheres to its principles and policies, intending to continue its non-recognition doctrine. This shows that there is still a considerable distance between Japan and the U.S. in their understanding of the situation in the Far East, which is noteworthy. (2) The U.S. suspects the limits of Japan's policy towards China. The U.S. believes that Japan's demand to abolish the 5-5-3 naval ratio is related to its Far East policy and feels a sense of danger, which proves this point. (3) The current relationship between Japan and the U.S. is extremely peaceful. At the beginning of this year, when Hirota and Hull exchanged official documents, both sides unanimously asserted that the problems between Japan and the U.S. could be resolved through negotiation. However, the U.S. still harbors suspicion and anxiety, feeling uneasy about Japan's actions. Therefore, to fundamentally establish peace between Japan and the U.S., it is essential for the U.S. to abandon these feelings of suspicion. Regarding this point, Prince Konoe's opinion letter seems too polite in enlightening the U.S., leaving something to be desired. Although Prince Konoe implies that Japan needs to clearly express the new principles of Far Eastern peace to the U.S., Japan's actions from the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident to the Amau Statement have already clearly expressed these principles. Now, if Japan wants to propose its principles anew, how will it do so? This reveals that the central problem of future diplomacy with the U.S. still lies ahead, and Prince Konoe's opinion letter seems to lack a progressive spirit in this regard. (4) The opinion letter is generally appropriate and solid, fully demonstrating the spirit of peace of the Japanese government and people toward the U.S., which should not be overlooked. (Dentsu, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi, who met with Prince Konoe yesterday to listen in detail to the situation in the United States, told reporters that he only listened to Prince Konoe's observations about the United States and did not discuss future policies toward the U.S. Prince Konoe said that misunderstandings about Japan are still deep among the American government and people, so efforts should be made in the future to eliminate these misunderstandings and make the U.S. fully understand Japan and the Orient. I deeply agree with this, he said. (Dentsu, 8th)</p>
<p>Japan Will Establish</p>
<h3>Information Library in New York</h3>
<p>Konoe Made This Suggestion Upon His Return</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the opinion letter on the U.S. issue submitted by Prince Konoe, he mentioned the establishment of a new information library in New York. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs greatly supports this proposal. This type of library was first established by the United Kingdom in 1920 and has been quite effective ever since. Japan now feels the need to emulate it for the sake of promoting friendship with the U.S. The United Kingdom uses this library as the de facto representative office of its government for its political, economic, and social policies towards the U.S. The maintenance costs for the library are set at 50,000 yuan per year, and it has achieved practical results in its work with the U.S. The authorities of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in light of these actual circumstances, stipulated last year that the creation costs for the information library, a new project for diplomatic work, would be 100,000 yuan and the maintenance costs would be 80,000 yuan. It has already been decided by the ministry's council, and efforts are being made to establish it this year. Prince Konoe's report upon returning from his visit to the U.S. also expressed the same opinion, which is even more helpful. Therefore, they want to expedite its realization and also plan to build a similar library in Baghdad, the center of Europe. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the reform of organizations in Manchuria, the plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the plan of the Army are quite different. Although the basic principles are the same in both plans, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocates clearly defining the division between military, diplomatic, and administrative affairs in Manchuria and absolutely opposes the establishment of a colonial administrative organization, such as the Governor-General in Korea in the past. The contents of the plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are as follows: (1) Abolish the Governor-General of Kwantung, establish a new state governor, and preserve the two-in-one system of the Ambassador to Manchuria and the Commander of the Kwantung Army. However, retain the Minister of Colonial Affairs' supervisory authority over the South Manchuria Railway. (2) Gradually make the Ambassador to Manchuria a purely diplomatic official under the supervision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. (3) Reform the authority of the Commander of the Kwantung Army. Although discretion is delegated to the Army, it should be separated from the duties of the Ambassador in the future and only govern military administration and command. (4) Gradually improve all judicial, administrative, and economic powers of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary and all administrative powers transferred by the Governor-General of Kwantung to adapt to the current state of "Manchukuo." (5) The state governor is supervised by the Minister of Colonial Affairs. (6) In order to realize the economic control of Japan and Manchuria, a joint committee should be established under the direction of each minister to study concrete plans for economic prosperity.

<h3>Silver Shirt Party Activities in the U.S.</h3>
<p>California Assemblyman's Investigation Concludes</p>
<p>Believes it is a Dangerous International Organization</p>
<p>Los Angeles An investigation into the activities of the so-called "Silver Shirt Party," a secret group in the United States similar to the National Socialist Party, conducted by California Assemblyman Kram, concluded today, calling the party a dangerous international organization. The investigation into the party's activities has lasted for several weeks, and it is generally regarded as a revolutionary group aiming to overthrow the current government, seize power, establish a dictatorship, and exclude Jews, which is also one of the party's doctrines. The party plans to expel Jewish officials after seizing power. It is also said that the Silver Shirt Party is inciting the U.S. Army and Navy, but it is still unknown how many people in the military have been affected by its propaganda. All parties are paying close attention to this and suspect whether it has foreign support. (National News, 7th)</p>
<p>Daring Feat by Canadian Aviators</p>
<h3>Attempting Non-Stop Long-Distance Flight</h3>
<p>Aiming to Break French Record</p>
<p>Toronto At 5:12 AM this morning, Canadian aviators Captain Reed and Captain Alling took off together in an aircraft, planning to fly directly to Baghdad to break the world's non-stop long-distance flight record held by Lieutenants Rossi and Codouce. The aircraft they are using is named Seafarer, the same aircraft that the famous British aviators Mr. and Mrs. Morrison flew across the Atlantic last year. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison departed from Wales, UK on July 23 last year, planning to fly to New York, but were forced to land in a field in Stratford, Connecticut at night due to fog and dwindling fuel. The aircraft body was severely damaged and later fully repaired. Rossi and Codouce are French aviators who also flew from New York in May last year, also attempting to fly directly to Baghdad, but were forced to land in Rayak, Syria due to a leak in the fuel tank, covering 5,653 and a half miles.

<p>U.S. Treasury Orders 150 Million Yuan of Gold</p>
<h3>Transferred from San Francisco to Denver</h3>
<p>Rumors of Preparing for War in the Pacific</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today confirmed that the Treasury Department will order the transfer of gold worth 150 million yuan from San Francisco to Denver. Senior Treasury officials refused any discussion and would not answer whether this move was related to Japan. According to rumors circulating in financial circles here and in New York, this transfer is due to the possibility of war in the Pacific, so the Treasury Department believes that the interior is safer. However, according to the Treasury Secretary, San Francisco is an earthquake zone, so there is a risk of "accidental loss" of the gold, but he was unwilling to make detailed statements. (National News, 7th)</p>
<p>San Francisco Outside rumors that the Mint here will transfer a huge amount of gold to Denver due to fears of earthquakes. People in San Francisco just laughed at this. Thirty years ago, the city of San Francisco was destroyed by fire, and residents still do not believe that it was due to an earthquake. Therefore, they do not pay any attention to the reason for the transfer of gold given by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau from Washington. However, they say that the Mint here will be demolished soon, so the gold is temporarily transferred to Denver in preparation for the reconstruction of a new building. As for the rumors circulating outside that this move is related to the war in the Pacific, no one in San Francisco is willing to express any opinion. (National News, 7th)</p>
<p>Denver Officials at the Denver Mint today declined to comment on the Treasury Department's plan to move a huge amount of gold from the San Francisco Mint to here, but said that everything is under the control of Washington and that they only know that they will receive a batch of cash.

<p>New Government in Vienna</p>
<h3>Agrees to Papen as Ambassador to Austria</h3>
<p>Only Holds the Position of Ordinary Ambassador</p>
<p>Relations Between Germany and Austria Tend to Ease</p>
<p>Vienna The issue of Papen's ambassadorship to Austria has been considered by the Austrian government for a long time. The final resolution has been reached. After a long meeting today, the cabinet decided to accept Papen. Papen will hold the position of ordinary ambassador, not as Hitler initially proposed as a special envoy to Austria. This appointment would violate diplomatic customs. This section was not mentioned in today's cabinet meeting, because Germany only asked the Austrian government to accept Papen as an ordinary ambassador. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Vienna The cabinet has decided today to accept German Deputy Chancellor Papen as the ambassador to Austria. After the Austrian government expressed its agreement on this issue, the tense state between Germany and Austria caused by the National Socialist Party's assassination of Dollfuss should ease further. Germany announced this appointment a week ago, without the Austrian government's prior knowledge, which violated diplomatic etiquette. This was strongly criticized, and for a time there was talk that the Austrian cabinet would reject Papen. The issue has now come to an end. (National News, 7th)</p>
<p>Archduke Otto Goes to Italy</p>
<h3>Sparks Various Speculations</h3>
<p>Vienna The actions of Archduke Otto of Austria are now causing various speculations among European governments. The Archduke traveled by car from Vienna to Italy today, claiming to visit his mother, who will stay in Italy for three weeks. It is said that the Archduke is going to Italy for marriage, or that this trip is to meet Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, aiming to restore the monarchy. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome Three sisters of Archduke Otto of the old Austrian Habsburg royal family are now staying at the villa of Prince Bourbon Parma, a relative. The deposed Empress Zita and Archduke Otto himself will also come soon, and various rumors have arisen because of this. Some say that the Archduke will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, others say that the Archduke will meet with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, and others say that these rumors are absolutely unreliable. It is said in diplomatic circles that caution should be exercised. It is said that Austrian cabinet members believe that the solution to the Austrian problem should be sought in the restoration of the deposed royal family, but the biggest difficulty encountered in this move is that the Little Entente countries and France are both opposed to the restoration, and they hope that Italy will do its best to help, but Italy is unwilling to take it upon itself. In addition, a certain important person who sympathizes with the Austrian old royal family of Habsburg claims that those around Archduke Otto believe that the time for restoration has not yet come, and that there is no certainty of support or opposition from all sides, especially in Italy. This issue should not be raised rashly. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Continues Previous Policy</h3>
<p>Dollfuss' Spirit Lives On</p>
<p>(Paris) Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg recently gave a speech in French, "narrating the circumstances of former Chancellor Dollfuss's murder." The recording of the speech was preserved, and the French National Radio Station broadcast Schuschnigg's speech again today. Schuschnigg "detailed the circumstances of Dollfuss's murder, saying that for two years the former Chancellor struggled hard and persevered, with the intention of preserving Austria's independence and dignity. Unexpectedly, villains attacked Austria repeatedly, and stopped at nothing to achieve their goals. Austria is an old civilized country of thousands of years, from which Germanic and Christian culture all originated, and it is the source of thought for the whole of Europe. Dollfuss loved it, but external forces destroyed it, which is truly heartbreaking." Schuschnigg continued, "The policy pursued by Dollfuss was a policy of maintaining peace. Although Dollfuss is dead, his policy must continue. In short, the purpose we hold is to resist violence with law, to resist evil with justice, and to resist madness with reason. Only the world can understand this sentiment." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Severe Laws to Punish Rebels</h3>
<p>Vienna Military courts are still successively trying various defendants in the recent rebellion case. Today, a soldier named Fick, who participated in the occupation of the Prime Minister's Office on July 24, was sentenced to death. After hearing the sentence, the defendant raised his hand in a National Socialist salute and shouted "Long live Hitler!" The defendant was immediately led out and hanged. In addition, two other defendants, one a member of the National Socialist Party named Gastaernigg, were sentenced to death by the Klagenfurt military court, and a 19-year-old member of the National Socialist Party was sentenced to 12 years in prison. After the defendant sentenced to death asked President Miklas for clemency, the sentence was reduced to 15 years in prison. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Germany Continues Anti-Austrian Propaganda</h3>
<p>Vienna German radio stations began anti-Austrian propaganda again yesterday. People here believe that although Germany verbally acknowledges Austria's independence on the surface, it is secretly continuing to interfere in Austria's internal affairs. An Italian semi-official journalist, recently an attache to the Italian Embassy in Vienna, said that Germany under Hitler is determined to carry out its ambitions towards Austria. According to the speech Hitler recently made to a British journalist, regarding the Austrian issue, he only denied that Germany was interfering in Austria's internal affairs and did not change his policy towards Austria. It can be seen that the words of the Italian journalist are credible. The Federal Post commented on German-Austrian relations, saying, "What the Third Reich is doing in Austria is outrageous, and Austria has suffered deeply. And to say that the Austrian people still dream of merging with Germany is either ignorant or reversing right and wrong. It must be known that although Austria is small and poor, it does not want to be constrained by others. What it wants to maintain is freedom and independence." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Hindenburg</p>
<h3>A Touching Scene at the Funeral</h3>
<p>The Coffin Placed in the Tower on the Fourteenth Day</p>
<p>Citizens from Afar Reverently Pay Their Respects</p>
<p>All Attendees Wear Formal Attire</p>
<p>A Dazzling Array of Colors</p>
<p>One of the most solemn and touching scenes of the state funeral for the German national hero, Hindenburg, in Tannenberg, unfolded this afternoon. After Chancellor Hitler recited the eulogy, eight officers stepped forward and lifted Hindenburg's remains from the catafalque. Amidst a booming 101-gun salute, the remains were placed in the "General's Tower," where they will remain for fourteen days, allowing people from all over the country to come and pay their respects. As the eight officers slowly carried the coffin towards the General's Tower, the military band played the march of the Third Guard Regiment, which Hindenburg had commanded during his lifetime. After Hindenburg's coffin was placed in the tower, Hindenburg's family, Chancellor Hitler, Field Marshal Mackensen, and Minister of Defense General von Blomberg entered to pay their silent respects before the coffin. Then, the honor guard and those attending the funeral filed in to pay their last respects to the late president. It is estimated that over 20,000 people participated in the ceremony. However, the enclosure within the walls of the Tannenberg memorial could only accommodate 4,000 people. The remaining crowd had to stand outside the walls or gather at the nearby Hindenburg Sports Field, where a radio broadcast of the entire funeral proceedings allowed them to listen as if they were present. Those standing within the walls included important government officials, former imperial army officers, key figures from the current national defense forces and navy, special envoys from various countries, and representatives from major cities, churches, and organizations in Germany, as well as commanders of the stormtroopers. The space was packed with people. All civilians attending the funeral wore formal attire, creating a magnificent spectacle alongside the colorful uniforms of the army and navy officers and the gold-trimmed formal attire of the diplomats. The most eye-catching figures included British General Hamilton in his Scottish red military uniform, an Austrian officer in his green military uniform, the Egyptian envoy with his blood-red tassel on his embroidered hat, the Chinese diplomats in their gold-embroidered formal attire, and the Hungarian envoy in his ancient nobleman's attire.

<h3>The Hero's Hometown Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Mourn</h3>
<p>Poznań, now part of Polish territory after the war, originally belonged to Germany and was known as Posen. It is Hindenburg's hometown. Hindenburg was born there in 1847, his father being a Prussian officer. The city did not pay much attention to the passing of President Hindenburg. However, today, during Hindenburg's burial, the city's military barracks flew flags at half-mast to mourn. The German consulate was closed because its staff went to Tannenberg to participate in the funeral. German-owned shops and factories allowed their employees and workers to listen to the broadcast of the funeral service. The dilapidated area where Hindenburg's family had lived for generations has seen a continuous stream of visitors paying their respects after his death. However, although Hindenburg's former residence still stands, few people know that it is the birthplace of a great European hero and statesman. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Inspecting the Drought-Stricken Areas</h3>
<p>Twenty-Four States Affected by Disaster</p>
<p>Losses Amount to 1.5 Billion</p>
<p>President Roosevelt spoke to 10,000 farmers at Lake Texwell, urging them to maintain their faith and courage to fight against this year's unprecedented drought. The government will also do its best to provide relief. Although the audience looked wan, they welcomed the president enthusiastically. After the speech, they cheered in approval. Some farmers held up large banners with the words, "You have given us wine, please give us water." Upon seeing this, the president replied that wine is made by human effort, while water is determined by heaven. Therefore, the difficulty of the two cannot be compared. However, the government is doing its best to engage in public works and water storage projects, and several projects are already under construction. From there, the president will travel to Minneapolis and Rochester. After arriving in Rochester, he will give another national radio address, likely on the topic of the drought. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Assistant Director of the Central Relief Bureau, Weissbrodt, reported to President Roosevelt today about the severity of the drought in the country, stating that 26 million people have been affected. 400,000 households in 24 American states are currently receiving government assistance. Millions of livestock have died, with estimated losses reaching 1.5 billion yuan. This is the most serious disaster the Relief Bureau has ever encountered. Since Congress adjourned in mid-June, the drought has increased fourfold. Over 60% of the country's agricultural areas are now classified as disaster areas by officials. According to opinions, at least one-tenth of the affected households need to relocate to other parts of the United States in the hope of regaining economic independence. The Central Emergency Relief Bureau is urgently organizing relief agencies in 20 states to assist disaster-stricken farmers in relocating. The Federal Land Bank is currently providing loans to help farmers. The estimated number of cattle deaths in the disaster area is between 7 million and 10 million. President Roosevelt delivered a speech to farmers today on the side of the road during his return trip to Washington. The car was air-conditioned, but the heat wave outside was unbearable, with the temperature reaching 113 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

The governor today requested that the state's railways transport water free of charge to the worst-hit areas. The disaster situation is also severe in other parts of the West and Midwest. The temperature in Kansas City yesterday was 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Grain prices in Chicago are soaring due to the drought. Prices for wheat, rye, and barley today broke the season's records, while corn prices are the highest they have been in recent years. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>The Governor-General's Residence in Northern Ireland Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>Important Documents Saved, Cause of Fire Unknown</p>
<p>William III Once Commanded Battles Here</p>
<p>(London) Hillsborough Castle, the Governor-General's residence in Northern Ireland, built 300 years ago and located near the capital of Northern Ireland, was destroyed by a fire today. Staff, residents, police, and the Belfast fire brigade extinguished the fire after four hours, but only one-third of the building remained intact, and even that suffered minor damage. The Governor-General was not in the residence at the time, and the Governor-General's secretary was also on leave. The fire started in the secretary's office and spread to the entire building. The head of the Governor-General's guard, in honor of President Hindenburg's funeral, raised a flag to half-mast on the roof and suddenly saw flames erupting, so he immediately called the police. By the time the Belfast fire brigade arrived, after racing 12 miles, the fire had already broken through the roof and spread elsewhere. At the same time, the Governor-General's staff, police, and villagers rushed to move valuable documents, paintings, utensils, and artworks from the residence. They were lowered from the windows and piled onto the lawn, where police guarded them. The fire spread rapidly, and within an hour, the roof collapsed, and the magnificent ballroom and other rooms were reduced to ashes. A total of 30 rooms were destroyed. The rooms where the Prince of Wales and the Prince had recently resided were also completely destroyed. Hillsborough Castle was purchased by the British government and handed over to the Northern Irish government to be used as the Governor-General's residence. William III resided here in 1690 to command the Irish war. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is believed to be accidental. The residence may be rebuilt in the future. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>Zhang Qun Asks the Central Government for Subsidies</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun arrived at the Central Executive Yuan on the 8th, saying that Hubei is suffering from both floods and droughts, and the people's livelihood is devastated. Although the droughts of the 16th and 17th years of the Republic and the floods of the 15th and 20th years of the Republic were severe, there have rarely been simultaneous floods and droughts like this year. The current disaster area is expanding, and the society is increasingly panicked. Water conservancy is neglected, agricultural administration is dysfunctional, and human planning is lacking. The responsibility cannot be shirked. The provincial government, learning from past mistakes, believes that fundamental disaster preparedness is urgent. The measures include: A. Installing water pumps; B. Repairing ponds and weirs; C. Installing siphon pipes; D. Repairing ditches. A total of 2.4 million yuan is needed. He pleaded for consideration for the suffering people and requested subsidies to help realize these measures. He also telegraphed Kong Xiangxi, asking him to find ways to relieve the disaster victims. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Rice Industry Guild and the Rice Shop and Rice Shop Association are asking the competent authorities to find ways to provide relief and are asking the Social Affairs Bureau to borrow funds from the banking community to purchase rice. However, the banking community has consistently refused to grant loans. The supply from out-of-town merchants has decreased, and rice reserves are dwindling daily. Rice prices have recently soared. On the evening of the 7th, a meeting was convened with various rice merchants in Xiaguan and the city center. On the morning of the 8th, five representatives, including Tang Qiyu and Jiang Helong, were sent to the Social Affairs Bureau to appeal again. Section Chief Kuang Yunwen met with them and stated that he would immediately convey their representations. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the amount of rice reserves surveyed in Nanjing last time has suddenly decreased by about 20,000 dan. If the survey is not wrong, it means that the grain merchants are secretly hoarding to manipulate prices. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that the lack of rice reserves is a matter of great concern to them and that they may be able to find a relief solution in the short term. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>丨Special Commercial Intelligence from Reuters, August 8th丨</p>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>This morning in London, the price of gold rose by two and a half pence, reaching one hundred thirty-eight shillings and a half pence.</p>
<p>In the London silver market, the United States was the main buyer, and China sold. The market conditions were stable. The spot price was twenty pence nine three seven five, up one two five. Futures were twenty-one pence, up ○ six two five.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Although talk of inflation in the U.S. and Britain still exists, the pressure to sell dollars in the London foreign exchange market from the European continent this morning was slightly reduced compared to yesterday. The opening exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar was five dollars six and three seven five cents, the same as the closing rate for the U.S. and British currencies yesterday. At 11:00 AM, it rose by three one two five cents, but it fell by half a cent at noon, to five dollars six and one eight seven five cents. This price remained unchanged until 2:00 PM. One U.S. dollar is equivalent to three shillings eleven and four one four pence in British currency.</p>
<p>The opening exchange rate between Britain and France was seventy-six francs thirty-four, the same as yesterday's price, and remained unchanged until 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The New York foreign exchange market was stable this morning. The opening exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound fell by twenty-five cents, to five dollars six and one two five cents. At 10:30 AM, it rose by one two five cents, to five dollars six and two five cents. This is the most recent price.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>Before the opening of the New York stock market, the factors favorable to market conditions were (1) railway freight traffic, reaching approximately six hundred thousand and ninety cars, a number similar to last week's; (2) steel industry news, slightly better than before. The factor unfavorable to market conditions was the drought damage to commerce, a major factor in the current general situation. When the stock market opened today, the trend was stable, but there was little development in the market. Many important securities showed no change. Although the foothold strengthened at the opening, people lacked confidence, and it is expected that prices will not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>The cotton market in New York was stable this morning. The opening price rose by three points. It continued to rise before noon. The latest price rose by six points compared to the opening price. People in the industry are now awaiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture's report on cotton production. The general opinion is that if the reported numbers are lower than expected, the price of cotton will rise sharply.</p>
<p>The opening price of wheat in New York fell by about one point, partly due to profit-taking. However, some said that the foothold of the cotton market was strong and prices were about to rise.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market fell slightly due to profit-taking. At 1:00 PM, the October futures price was six shillings and two and a half pence, down six two five.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market opened firm. At 1:00 PM, the October futures price was six, nine three, up five points.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>

<h3>The Western Progress of the Longhai Railway Project</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) The track-laying project for the Tongxi section of the Longhai Railway has progressed westward from Weinan and is expected to reach Xi'an by the end of this year. The Ba River Railway is currently being rushed to completion. Due to the large number of culverts, it may be difficult to open to traffic for a while. Currently, a temporary road is being built under the bridge, about one kilometer long, with a gradient of 8 or 9 per thousand, to allow traffic to cross the river as soon as possible. The river bridge is expected to be completed within one month and should be finished in about two weeks. The construction of station buildings west of Weinan is currently being tendered.

<h3>Han and Song Meet in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Dredging the Xiaoqing River</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: According to a long-distance phone call from Qingdao on the evening of the 5th, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, came east from Jinan by special train yesterday (the 4th). Due to slight delays along the way, he stopped overnight at the Jiaozhou Railway Station. This morning (the 5th), he departed from Jiaozhou at 5:00 AM and arrived in Qingdao at 8:00 AM. Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, and many others greeted him at Cangkou. Song Ziwen, a member of the National Economic Council, Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao, Peng Dongyuan and Lu Mengxiong, members of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, and leaders of various Qingdao agencies were all waiting to greet him at the station. Accompanying Han were consultants Ge Jinzhang, Han Duofeng, Guo Zhigang, Zhang Liansheng, and many others. After Han got off the train and exchanged brief greetings with those welcoming him, he left the station and took a car to the Qingdao Club to rest.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, Han went to Song Ziwen's residence on Fushan Road to meet with Song. They talked for about two hours and had detailed discussions on the matter of dredging the Xiaoqing River. Song stated that although the Economic Council could not fully assume responsibility for the funds for dredging the Xiaoqing River, it would do its best to assist within a possible range. As for the amount of funds, it would be determined after visiting Jinan for inspection. At 6:30 PM, Han and others returned to their private residence. That evening, at 7:00 PM, Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting hosted a banquet for Han and others at the Yingbin Hotel. Song Ziwen and other dignitaries were all present to accompany them. Han and others attended the banquet as scheduled. Dozens of guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 10:00 PM and then dispersed. Han returned to his private residence to rest. Tomorrow (the 6th) at 7:00 PM, the entire committee of the Jiaoji Railway will host a banquet for Han at Peng Dongyuan's residence. The conversations between Han and Song with visitors are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Han Fuqu said, "This time I came to Qingdao purely in response to the telegram from Member Song (Ziwen) and to visit Mayor Shen Honglie and Chairman Ge, and have no other tasks. Member Song previously agreed to go to Jinan, so at the end of last month, I ordered Director Zhang (Honglie) to go to Qingdao to welcome him. At that time, Member Song was unable to set off due to matters and telegraphed back inviting me to come again for a meeting to discuss engineering costs related to dredging the Xiaoqing River and joint transportation with the Yellow River, and requested that the Economic Council allocate funds to assist in the project. Last time I came to Qingdao, I had already talked with Song. Later, Director Zhang came, carrying a report on Shandong's construction over the years and future plans, and presented them to Song. Song then expressed his willingness to assist in the project through the Economic Council, but there were no definite and concrete results. I just met with Member Song at his residence, and we had further discussions on the issues of carrying out the construction of the Xiaoqing River project and the Qingdao-Yellow River joint transportation. Song then agreed to allocate funds to assist in the project, but it must wait until Song inspects the Xiaoqing River project in Jinan before deciding. As for the matter of Qingdao Shandong University's financial assistance, because the current expenses in Shandong are extremely tight, it is really impossible to raise such a large amount of funds. I am also deeply regretful about this and unable to help. In recent days, various parties have repeatedly made requests, and President Wang specially sent Director Li Shengwu to Shandong for this purpose. I heard that Li has now arrived in Jinan and then took the second train to Qingdao last night (the 4th), but I have not yet met with him. In the future, I can only reluctantly take on a part, and wait until I meet Li before talking. I do not intend to stay in Qingdao for long, and will ask Song to return to Jinan with me in two or three days, which should be around the 10th."</p>
<p>(2) Song Ziwen said, "Regarding the Xiaoqing River project, Director Zhang also mentioned this matter when he came to Qingdao a few days ago. Now, I have invited Chairman Han (Fuqu) to come to Qingdao again purely for further concrete discussions. The Economic Council will be able to do its best to assist within a possible range. It is difficult to expect the Economic Council to be fully responsible for these project funds. However, depending on Shandong Province's plans for carrying out the project, it will be able to assist at any time. The result of the discussion with Chairman Han is just that. As for whether I will go to Jinan or not, if there are no important matters to hinder me at that time, I can go west with Chairman Han by the same car to return the kindness of repeated invitations, or I may go alone again. It is still undetermined." (5th)</p>

<p>Northwest Inspection Report by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<h3>Qinghai Province is Rich in Forest Products</h3>
<p>On the 24th, departing from Xiangtang, "Shina," five li away, has about forty or fifty households. Beans and wheat are abundant, and rapeseed flowers are more than half a zhang tall. Across the river, one can see the county seat of Minhe County. The houses are sparse, and the market is likely not prosperous. However, the yellow rapeseed flowers, the oily green beans and wheat, the shady trees, and the constant flow of canals make for a pleasant scenery, just like in Jiangnan. The land in the Shina area is commonly called "large paddy fields." Elm and poplar trees are planted above the fields, and fruit trees are also sparsely planted in the fields, with beans, wheat, potatoes, etc. planted underneath, all of which are very fertile. The land is fertile and the water conservancy is excellent compared to other places. Yangjiadian, ten li away, has steep and difficult slopes. The Huang River (such as a tributary of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, coming from Huangyuan County in northeastern Qinghai) on the left of the road has recently seen a sudden decrease in water flow due to a prolonged drought, resulting in many rafts and leather bags being stranded midway. The rocks on the river bank are shiny and bright. When broken, they have toughness, seemingly containing lead, zinc, and other substances. Villages in various counties along the river in Qinghai can mostly use river water to irrigate fields, as if applying fertilizer, as the river water contains mineral salts and sticky soil. The river water flows eastward into Gansu, and the water势 increases. If it can be channeled to irrigate the fields, increase production, and revitalize the rural economy, it can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Lianhuatai, ten li away, has a towering temple tower built on a high ridge with lush trees. People say that the barren mountains of Gansu and Qinghai do not grow trees, which proves that this is purely nonsense. The boundary marker between Minhe and Ledu counties is located below the tower, but unfortunately, the words are blurry and difficult to distinguish. Going further to Zaoshiya, the cliff on the right of the road is steep and towering into the clouds. The abyss on the left of the road is thousands of zhang deep, making it terrifyingly dangerous. Someone has engraved "One Dragon" on the cliff, and the winding and narrow road can be imagined. On the opposite cliff, the four characters "Never Forget National Humiliation" are inscribed, and the dangerous road and worried heart make one feel even more alarmed when reading them. A cliff stretches out, shading the scorching sun. More than a dozen people are sitting under the shade, all of whom are going to Gansu Province to work. After resting and chatting with them, most of them asked anxiously, "Have you seen the flowers being marked (referring to opium poppies) when you came up (from Gansu to Qinghai, commonly referred to as 'coming up'; conversely, it is called 'coming down')?" The answer was, "One-fourth of the area has been marked." They then said, "Oh, that's still early. But I heard that the sales of new opium are sluggish this year, and we who suffer (i.e., work) will also suffer a bit. In previous years, each flower festival could earn twenty or so yuan, but this year it's impossible, right?" Another worker said, "A'san came back sick the day before yesterday and said that his old customers from previous years are all marking the flowers themselves this year, and even the pampered eldest daughter (referring to his daughter) in his family is showing her snow-white skin under the fire-like heat (a common term for the sun) and marking the flowers." Another person said, "In that case, we are going to starve." The words they said mostly contained practical information about the rural economy and people's lives. Unfortunately, due to being covered in dust and unable to rest, there was no time to have further conversations.</p>
<p>The section of land twenty li west of "One Dragon" is currently under construction. Workers are assigned according to the area of land. According to what they said, "The most difficult road to build in this section is none other than the Parrot's Beak and Laoya Pass. The road is winding and narrow, and the rocky peaks are rugged and towering. To fill in the collapses, stone layers must be built from the bottom of the river, accumulating level by level to a height of more than ten zhang. To widen the narrow parts, rocks must be drilled and chiseled, which takes twice the effort and costs a lot."</p>
<p>Laoya City, thirty li away, has thick willows providing shade along the way, densely covering the sky. Travelers may suspect that they are in Lushan escaping the summer heat, and forget the hardships of the long journey in the summer season. The city has eighty or ninety households. Suddenly, there was a heavy rain, and the farmers were overjoyed at the long-awaited rain. The clouds dispersed, the rain stopped, and the air was fresh. Afterwards, passing through Baiya Village, Pujiadun, and Changli Town, there were especially abundant fruits such as walnuts, hawthorns, pears, and jujubes. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, they could not be transported far away to earn high prices. Moreover, there is always a clear spring under the trees, and the clear spring flows down to become fertile fields. Traveling through it, both shaded and drinking, one cannot bear to bid farewell. If one could cultivate and graze there, the feelings of homesickness would be indescribable.</p>
<p>Staying overnight at Gaomiao Town, the total journey was eighty li. The town has about 300 households and is the largest town under the jurisdiction of Ledu County. Shops selling oil, groceries, cloth, grain, and other goods are all readily available, which is the most lively market seen since Lanzhou. The town has one elementary school each for boys and girls. There are more than eighty boys and more than twenty girls. Most of them are over ten years old before starting school. Therefore, the age of students in the fifth and sixth grades is as old as high school students elsewhere. The sound of chanting could be heard far and wide early the next morning. Getting up early to study is commendable. On the west side of the town, a pox god temple is built on the fort, which the villagers greatly admire. The ignorant men and women do not know how to vaccinate their children in advance. Once smallpox is transmitted, they are terrified and reverently offer brocade curtains, fancy screens, and fancy shoes to the deity. The statue is obscured by the red and green decorations, and the depth of superstition can be said to be extreme.</p>
<p>On the 25th, departing from Gaomiao Town, women set up stalls along the willow shade to sell cooked eggs, potatoes, cold noodles, and other items. Shepherds and old men mostly wore green willow hats, which were very distinctive. Looking left at the mountain peaks, they were all silvery, and I knew that it had snowed heavily last night due to the cold weather. The climate in Qinghai is originally cold. Taking fruits as an example, the apricots and plums in Lanzhou have already matured and are on the market, while those produced here are only as big as fingers. It is expected that they will mature a month later. The maturation period of other melons and fruits is also later than elsewhere. Ledu County, fifteen li away, has a city built of earth, divided into inner and outer layers. A white pagoda is built on the southeastern corner of the city, with the slogan "Never Forget National Humiliation" written in red. The road follows the western part of the city. Below the city by the river is Donghu Park, which only has hundreds of tree seedlings and a bay of flowing water. The rest of the scenery seems to be still under cultivation. Outside the south gate, there are three springs gushing from the ground, developed into three ponds. Stones are piled around the ponds to raise the ground into a terrace. Railings are placed on the left and right of the terrace. A pavilion covers the pond, with the name "Yinhe Pavilion" and the pond called "Yinhe Pond," taking the meaning of harmony, joy, and health. I originally wanted to visit the city, but suddenly saw soldiers checking very carefully. To avoid trouble, I did not go.</p>
<p>Daxia, fifteen li away, has two mountains close together, with the Huangshui River flowing through them like a silver belt. The area produces placer gold, which the locals pan for using traditional methods. A group of five people earns two or three fen per day, which is truly a "neither starving to death nor getting rich" livelihood. The gorge is more than two li long, suddenly opening up, and one can see the beautiful scenery of fertile fields and lush forests again. Xiakou Fort, fifteen li away, has about a hundred households, plastered with notices with slogans such as "Publicly Prohibit Gambling, Violation Will Be Punished." Going further to Zhangjia Town, I stayed overnight. The town is fifty li east of Ledu and one hundred and twenty li north of the county seat (Huzhu) and seventy li west of Xining. Talking with a farmer named Wang, he claimed that "he sows five dou of land and can harvest five shi. After deducting five dou for seeds and paying one shi of grain, he only has three shi and five dou left. A family of five can barely make a living. However, in recent years, due to the frequent addition of taxes and the conversion of grain rations, not only does he feel that he cannot make ends meet, but he is also gradually in danger of freezing and starving. According to custom, renting one dou of land requires paying three dou of wheat in rent per year. The grain money and seeds are all borne by the tenant. Now, even if someone is hired to rent the land, exempting the rent of wheat and only hoping to bear the grain money, no one dares to accept." The area is rich in wood, especially poplar trees, which are planted in forests in the corners of fields to be used for building houses. Building a courtyard house, without covering the roof with tiles or plastering with lime, with three sides and nine rooms, costs only more than ten yuan in wages to live in a new house, which is a common occurrence. As for the big mountain south of the village, it looks lush and green, which is a natural forest of pine and cypress. I heard that the trees there are several spans in circumference and several zhang high, with a production area of about three hundred li around. Timber merchants cut and tie them into rafts, releasing them downstream, selling well in other provinces, which accounts for a major source of Qinghai's economy. The town has a Niangniang Temple (Temple of the Goddess), with two goddesses enshrined in the center. If rain and hail damage the crops, the villagers gather by beating gongs and carry the goddess in a sedan chair to tour the four mountains, even leaving her out in the rain for a long time in order to pray for clear weather. If there is a prolonged drought, the goddess is moved under the scorching sun or placed for a long time next to a spring to pray for heavy rain. Therefore, the goddess is carried out and welcomed in dozens of times a year. The villagers deceive themselves and cause trouble, which is too much.</p>

<h3>Yuguan Qindao Exercises</h3>
<p>British Troops Conduct Field Exercises, Japanese Troops Conduct Street Warfare</p>
<p>Warships of Both Sides Gather in the Waters off Qindao</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: British troops stationed in North China recently held their annual summer exercises. This matter, due to a statement issued by the head of the Japanese business affairs office in Yuguan, Mr. Iwai, caused serious negotiations between Britain and Japan. The British ambassador, Sir Miles Lampson, dismissed the Japanese statement while vacationing in Beidaihe, and the British troops, in accordance with the Boxer Protocol, set out from Qinhuangdao at 2:00 PM on July 31st with the 15th Company, consisting of 200 men, carrying eight cannons, twenty machine guns, and thirty-two horses. They proceeded to Erlangmiao near Yuguan, following the planned exercise schedule. The first day involved field maneuvers, the second day artillery practice, the third day a fortified point battle, the fourth day night combat, and the fifth day a battle for strategic points and an engagement battle, for a total of five days of exercises. The exercise area was centered on Erlangmiao, with Jiukou Pass as the base camp. The original plan was to march to Jiaoshan, but the Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan, considering the location a strategic point, sent a small detachment to garrison it, seemingly intending to occupy it first and prevent the British troops from ascending. Therefore, the British troops ceased their march to that area. While the British troops were exercising at Erlangmiao, the Japanese troops stationed in Yuguan, intending to demonstrate their power, also held street warfare exercises within the city with a part of the Kwantung Army. Approximately 500 troops participated, and on South Gate Outer Street, they displayed guns and cannons seized from our side during the battles of the Great Wall. From the afternoon of the 31st, when the exercises began, until the morning of the 4th, they fired cannons daily, echoing the sound of British guns and cannons at Erlangmiao. Before the British troops went to Erlangmiao, five British warships successively sailed from Weihaiwei harbor to Qinhuangdao. The flagship, HMS Folkestone, arrived at the port on the afternoon of the 31st. The ship had twenty-four cannons and carried 770 naval officers and sailors. The Naval Admiral also arrived in Qinhuangdao that evening on the Kailuan Mining Bureau's coal transport ship Fuping and went directly to Erlangmiao to review the exercises. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, British sailors twice landed in Qinhuangdao for parades to demonstrate their strength. Japanese soldiers stationed in Qinhuangdao also refused to be outdone, and from the 1st, they coordinated with Japanese sailors on Japanese warships anchored in the Qinhuangdao sea area to practice harbor seizure battles. At the same time, six Japanese warships belonging to the 1st and 2nd Fleets successively arrived at the harbor, taking a monitoring attitude towards the British warships. The atmosphere there was as tense as in the Yuguan area. Two hundred Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin also took the Beining train to Qinhuangdao on the afternoon of the 2nd to participate in the exercises, causing rumors to intensify. By 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, the British troops had completed their exercises at Erlangmiao and returned to Qinhuangdao, and the Japanese troops in Yuguan and Qindao ceased their exercises. However, the British and Japanese warships anchored in the Qindao sea area had not yet left. Today, more than 200 British soldiers stationed in Ping were heading east to Qindao. It is said that the British troop exercises are being conducted in sections. After the Qindao garrison exercises are completed, the garrisons in other areas will continue to conduct them. Therefore, the sound of British guns and cannons may still be heard in Yuguan in the coming days. Because the British troop exercises have not yet been completed, the Japanese army has also ordered troops along the Beining line to prepare for large-scale marches and exercises in Tangshan, Changli, Luanxian, Yuguan, Tanggu, Haizhen, and Qinhuangdao simultaneously. The date is not yet set, but it will roughly depend on the date of the second British exercise. It has been rumored that British soldiers were exercising in Yuguan and Japanese soldiers were exercising in Jiaoshan, and a stray bullet wounded a British soldier. After investigation with all parties concerned, this was not the case. However, on the morning of the 3rd, British sailors on British warships anchored in Qinhuangdao landed and encountered Japanese sailors. They argued over the right of way, and eventually, officers from both sides arrived to restrain their subordinates. The talk of a stray bullet may have been a misinterpretation of this incident.

<h3>Hubei Province Actively Rescues Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee Established, Work is Intense</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Determines Engineering Plans to Permanently Prevent Drought and Flooding</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hubei Provincial Government, due to simultaneous drought and flooding causing widespread disasters throughout the province and millions of refugees starving, has specially organized a Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee as a dedicated organization to coordinate relief efforts, so that manpower and financial resources can be concentrated to achieve twice the results with half the effort. The committee was officially established on the 6th and elected He Hengfu, Meng Guangpeng, Li Fanyi, Ma Boyuan, and Zhou Weitang as standing committee members. The provincial government designated He Hengfu as the chairman, Meng Guangpeng as the director of the General Affairs Group, with Wang Kaihua as the deputy; Zhou Xingtang as the director of the Finance Group, with Jia Shiyi as the deputy; He Hengfu as the director of the Relief Group, with Chen Jingyu as the deputy; Li Fanyi as the director of the Public Works Group, with Yang Silian as the deputy; Wang Yiling as the director of the Audit Group, with Su Taiyu as the deputy; and Ma Boyuan as the director of the Investigation Group, with Chen Huaizhong as the deputy. On the 7th, the first meeting was held and the following key issues were decided: (1) The standard for the distribution of relief funds is 60% for work relief, 20% for agricultural relief, and 20% for emergency relief, with the responsible group drafting a plan. (2) An investigation into the disaster situation in various areas will be carried out by the Investigation Group, which will convene the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Civil Affairs Department, the Cooperative Guidance Committee, the Rural Financial Relief Office, and other relevant organizations to allocate investigation work and formulate a plan to be submitted to the committee. Furthermore, as standing committee members He Hengfu and Zhou Xingtang are currently in Lushan, telegrams were sent requesting their return to Hubei to preside over the committee's affairs. Provincial government chairman Zhang Qun stated, "Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been arid, and there has been no rain for a long time. The eastern and southern parts of Hubei, as well as the counties near the provincial capital, have been severely affected. Rice, beans, hemp, and cotton have all withered, and the autumn harvest is already hopeless. The severity of the disaster is so great, the suffering of the people can be imagined. On the other hand, in the upper reaches of the Xiang River, mountain torrents have erupted, and the Xiang River and the East Jing River have suddenly surged, with water levels three feet higher than in the past twenty years. Embankments in the coastal counties have collapsed, causing further flooding. Currently, the flood disaster is not yet extremely serious, but the drought-stricken areas are expanding daily, which is truly heartbreaking. The provincial government's solutions to treat the symptoms and address the root causes have long been drafted. What we hope for from the central government is not only temporary relief to treat the symptoms, but especially fundamental famine preparedness measures. The so-called root cause solution is to study how to prevent floods and how to use water to prevent drought. This is a major issue that cannot be solved with a small amount of money, nor can it be accomplished in a short period of time. A preliminary engineering plan has been determined, with a total cost of 2.4 million yuan. The plan can be divided into four parts: (1) Installing water pumps; (2) Installing siphons and culverts; (3) Digging ponds and embankments; (4) Dredging ditches. Our province straddles the Yangtze and Han rivers, with 36 counties relying on embankments for protection. In the past, the government and the people only focused on embankments and did not pay attention to the problems of drainage and irrigation within the embankments. Even if the embankments are intact, they suffer from waterlogging in the spring and summer, and drought causes a lack of water for irrigation. It is now planned to select important embankments and install 50 pumping stations to pump water from the Yangtze and Han rivers for irrigation during droughts and drain accumulated water to benefit farmland. This project requires 15,000 yuan per station, totaling 750,000 yuan. If the embankment area is small and the terrain and water level do not require the installation of a pumping station, siphons can be installed on the top of the embankment or culverts can be buried at the bottom of the embankment, which is cheaper and less labor-intensive than pumping stations. It is planned to select 30 locations, costing 10,000 yuan each, for a total of 300,000 yuan. As for fields in high-lying and mountainous areas, they traditionally rely on ponds and embankments for water storage, but their scale is small and they are gradually silting up. It is planned to dig 500 new ponds in areas of northern and eastern Hubei that are in greater need, each with an area of 3 mu and a standard depth of 7 meters, costing a total of 650,000 yuan. Furthermore, ditch drainage is particularly important. It is planned to excavate distribution and branch ditches, totaling approximately 500 kilometers in length, with an average area of 22,067 square meters, costing a total of 1.1 million yuan. The total cost of the above four projects is 2.4 million yuan, with earthwork accounting for two-thirds, or 1.8 million yuan, which can all be used for work relief to aid disaster victims." (7th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Temporarily Banned from Export</h3>
<p>Suppressing Rice Prices, No More Than Ten Yuan Per Stone</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: This area is suffering from a severe drought, and rice prices are soaring. High-quality machine-milled rice is selling for as much as 11.67 yuan per stone, and lower grades are also around 11 yuan. At retail stores, one yuan can only buy nine sheng of rice. A month ago, rice prices were still around six yuan, but now they have risen more than twofold, a phenomenon only seen after the great flood of twenty years ago. Wuhu Port is a gathering area for rice and grain in southern Anhui. Guangdong, Yantai, Ningbo, and various garrisoned troops all have permanent purchasing agencies, and exports are no less than 8 million stones per year. Now that selling prices are skyrocketing, not only are outside buyers absorbing as much as possible, but also counties in the interior of this province are coming to Wuhu to purchase and stock up in preparation for rice shortages. Market prices are still expected to continue rising, and the livelihoods of ordinary people are increasingly panicked as a result. Therefore, Wang Baozhai, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District, specially convened a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 this morning, gathering leaders from the rice and grain transport industry, the rice industry, the miscellaneous grain and rice industry, the rice husking industry, and the rice milling industry to discuss relief measures. Chairman Wang presided over the meeting, and it was generally agreed that the soaring rice prices were causing unspeakable hardship for ordinary people and also affecting the social mood. It was decided to suppress rice prices, with the highest price for machine-milled rice not to exceed 10 yuan per stone. In order to prevent local rice shortages and maintain the people's food supply, exports of rice and grain will be suspended from today (the 7th) until the 30th of this month. The future situation will be monitored, but the circulation of new grain will still be allowed in order to avoid affecting the counties. The above two resolutions were officially announced and implemented by the Commissioner. If this can suppress rice prices, people's hearts will be greatly stabilized. (6th)</p>
<h3>Flooding in Northern Shandong Rivers</h3>
<p>Yucheng's Zhao Niu River and Deng Jin River Breach One After Another</p>
<p>Vast Disaster Area within Qihe County, Fields and Houses Washed Away</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the dredging of the Zhao Niu River in northern Shandong, only the middle reaches within Qihe County were not dredged. After the heavy rains ten days ago, the river water rose sharply, and the water in the Zhao Niu River could not drain into the Tuhai River, leading to flooding and breaches. In addition, the Zhao Niu River backflowed, and the Deng Jin River also breached. Initially, on July 26th, the Deng Jin River breached on the west bank of Zhujia Daokou. On the 29th, the Zhao Niu River also breached at Jiehekou. The two rivers converged southward, inundating approximately 100 hectares of farmland. The water level of the Deng Jin River did not decrease slightly. On the 4th of this month, it breached again on the east bank of Zhujia Daokou, with the water heading northeast directly through Qihe County into the Tuhai River. The water surface was two to three li wide, up to eight or nine li, and more than twenty li long. Fields and houses were washed away, and the autumn crops that were about to ripen were completely submerged. The disaster is extremely severe. Within Yucheng County, fortunately, the rescue and plugging were timely, and the disaster was avoided. The Construction Department previously sent technician Meng Xianzheng to investigate the relationship between the Deng Jin River, Zhao Niu River, Tizhang River, and Luo River in order to plan for the aftermath. He is currently inspecting. The following is a record of Meng's telegram reporting the river breaches: "I inspected the breaches of the Zhao Niu River and Deng Jin River in Yucheng and the dangerous works along the coast on August 1st. The Zhao Niu River breached at Jiehekou on July 29th, about 50 meters wide. The Deng Jin River breached at Zhujia Daokou on July 26th at noon. These two breaches converge in District 2, inundating approximately 200 hectares of land. Local residents built a water barrier at Shuangmiaozi to prevent the water from spreading southward. At 3:00 AM on August 4th, the Deng Jin River breached again on the east bank of Zhujia Daokou, with the water heading northeast directly towards Gan Yutou, rushing into the Tuhai River. The affected area is approximately 20 li long and two to three li to eight or nine li wide. Ninety percent of the area is under the jurisdiction of Qihe. Currently, there are seven dangerous works on the north bank of the Zhao Niu River: Qiliquiao, Zhangshui Daokou, Baimiaotang, Shangyoujun, Zhangzhuang, Jiehekou, and the west bank of Boluotun and Qiaozhaowangzhuang. Fortunately, the county magistrate and the four sections have been urging the people to work hard to protect the area, and most of Yucheng has been spared from the disaster. I am currently planning to inspect the relationship between the Danzhang River, Luo River, Tuhai River, and Zhao Niu River in order to plan for the aftermath. I hereby submit this report and request that it be forwarded to the director of the department for review. Your humble servant, Meng Xianzheng." (5th)</p>
<p>Weihaiwei</p>
<h3>The Process of Preparing for the Establishment of an Airport</h3>
<p>Weihai Correspondence: Xu Dongfan, the commissioner of Weihaiwei Management, believes that the inconvenience of land transportation in the port poses a great obstacle to local prosperity and industrial development. He urgently hopes to leverage the power of aviation to provide relief. Because Weihai occupies an important international position, all facilities have been observed by both Chinese and foreigners since our country recovered it. Moreover, Weihai Port is the base of our country's Third Fleet in peacetime. During the summer and autumn seasons each year, the British fleet moors here, with up to 8,000 British officers and soldiers. The comings and goings of warships from other countries are even more difficult to estimate. During the summer, there are at least a thousand foreign tourists and expatriates, and there are also many Chinese people who come here for travel or to escape the summer heat. The round trips of these passengers and mail rely entirely on maritime transportation. Land transportation lacks adequate connections. Passengers who wish to travel quickly and mail that needs to arrive quickly really feel the need to use aviation. This is also an urgent need in reality.</p>
<p>The Changfeng area of Weihai originally had an airport with complete equipment. It is said that the Management Office recently expanded the field to the size of the Qingdao Airport, which is sufficient for aircraft to take off and land. If the China National Aviation Corporation's aircraft traveling on the Shanghai-Ping Line can detour through Weihai, it can use this field. Commissioner Xu also worried that the company might have difficulties with the increased expenses of establishing a station. Therefore, he resolutely agreed to handle the airport affairs on behalf of the Management Office to reduce the company's burden in order to realize this as soon as possible. Local people also expressed their sympathy for this initiative. Therefore, starting in late May of this year, negotiations with the China National Aviation Corporation began, with several letters and telegrams exchanged. Subsequently, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Transportation was asked to preside over and urge the matter to benefit the local area. Several letters and telegrams were received from Minister Zhu, all of which promised to instruct the company to plan and proceed accordingly. At the same time, Commissioner Xu used his personal relationships to send letters to Lou Guanglai, the director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, to help mediate, and he also agreed to assist. However, in reality, the company also had considerable difficulties, which could not be achieved overnight. Because the aircraft currently flying between Shanghai and Ping have a speed of 110 kilometers per hour, if the flight time is extended, the pilots will inevitably be too tired. In addition, detouring through Weihai requires crossing the sea, which cannot be accommodated by aircraft designed to travel on land. Because of this obstacle, on June 26th, the Ministry of Communications forwarded a telegram from the company stating that "when faster aircraft are replaced in the future, a branch line may be opened in Weihai to connect with the main line." The company's letter to Commissioner Xu on June 15th also contained the same statement. Minister Zhu's reply on July 11th also stated that "it would be most appropriate for the company to plan and open a branch line in the future." It can be seen that the company's current inability to quickly open the Weihai airport is due to the perceived difficulties in existing aircraft technology.</p>
<p>According to recent reliable information from the Ministry of Transportation, the airline will purchase new aircraft from the United States in November of this year, with the speed increasing to 180 kilometers per hour, saving one-third of the time compared to the current aircraft. These aircraft can certainly open a branch line in Weihai to connect with the main line. At that time, there will be no difficulty in adding an airport. Therefore, it is still possible for passengers and mail to and from Weihai to use aviation in the near future.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Prefecture Orders the Abolition of Miscellaneous Taxes in this County</h3>
<p>The National Finance Conference resolved to select miscellaneous taxes that are close to harsh and meticulous in various provinces, cities, and counties and abolish them separately, and find other means of compensation to alleviate the people's difficulties. The Jiangsu Provincial Government first complied and successively reviewed the harsh and meticulous miscellaneous taxes in various counties, whether or not they were included in the budget, and ordered their abolition in stages in order to comply with the central government's intention to care for the people's hardships. The miscellaneous local taxes in this county that have been declared abolished by the prefectural order, after review, include seven items: stall tax 100, pig tax 326, boat tax 1,470, cattail bag tax 100, public welfare tax 1,800, egg tax 30, and temporary defense tax 13,080. The county government was ordered to announce their abolition, and the remaining items will be ordered to comply after they have been sorted out. The county government has already ordered compliance.</p>
<h3>Ministry Committee Comes to Songjiang to Investigate Taxes</h3>
<p>Weng Zhiyong, a specialist from the Finance Ministry's Committee for the Reorganization of Local Taxes, arrived in Songjiang by train on the afternoon of the 8th with the mission of investigating the tax situation in various counties. After meeting with County Magistrate Jin, he was accompanied by Magistrate Jin to the First and Second National Tax Collection Offices to inquire in detail about the county's farmland tax amount and how it was collected. The heads of each office responded that the detailed amount of farmland tax, the collection method, the procedure for giving small receipts to the taxpayers after they paid the tax, and the future procedure for redeeming receipts for strings of cash are all detailed. Now that small receipts have been banned, tax strings are given immediately upon payment, but the procedure is cumbersome, and a proper method has not yet been devised. Therefore, the first phase of land value tax has not yet been initiated. After the tax funds are collected, they will be reported and remitted at any time. Then, he inspected various books and records and withdrew. He then went to the Donation Office to investigate the nature, amount, and use of various donations, asking about each item in detail. After the investigation is completed, he must leave Songjiang by train that evening.</p>
<h3>Aviation National Salvation Propaganda Troupe Comes to Songjiang</h3>
<p>The National Aviation Salvation Walking National Propaganda Troupe of the Republic of China is an organization formed by former Northeast National Salvation Army anti-Japanese comrades. The troupe leader, Chen Zhenglong, and his 11 members have been doing written and oral propaganda in various entertainment venues in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, they walked from the Shanghai North Station to Songjiang and temporarily stayed at the county party headquarters. That evening, they promoted the Northeast battle, the reasons for the failure, and the relationship between the air force and national defense at the Songjiang Grand Theater. The audience was deeply moved. They will stay for a short while and then walk to Fengjing and other places. The scheduled itinerary is two and a half years, and they will not solicit donations along the way.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Inspector of Training Comes to Suzhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>Bai Zhujun, the Inspector of Training for the Security Regiments of the eight counties of Su, Xi, Chang, and Kun, has already gone from the province to Changshu to inspect the Security Regiment of that county in order to inspect the Security Regiments of various counties. He is scheduled to come to Suzhou today (the 10th) to inspect the Security Regiment of Wu County. The local Security Headquarters is already preparing for the inspection. After Inspector Bai arrives in Suzhou, he will set up a headquarters in the Longqing Temple in Cangmi Lane to facilitate his work.</p>
<h3>Suppression of the Golden City Film Company Negotiation</h3>
<p>Someone named Xue et al. established the Suzhou office of the Shanghai Golden City Film Company at No. 477 Lindun Road in Suzhou City, with the slogan of filming "Female Typical" and "Weak Willow Mad Wind." They advertised in newspapers to recruit dozens of basic actors, charging each person 15 yuan for lectures and makeup fees. For a time, there were quite a few people who went to register. However, the Education Bureau believed that the company's organization was unsound and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to suppress it. Wu Detang, a local resident, was also one of the basic actors and obtained a receipt for the makeup fee. Because of the Public Security Bureau's suppression, it was believed that the company was suspected of fraud. The night before last, he negotiated with Tang Youyin, the director of the finance department of the company, at the Tai Dong Hotel on Dama Road, demanding reimbursement of makeup and other fees. At that time, a fight broke out. The hotel called the police on duty, who took Wu and Tang to the district office. On the 9th, they were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Most of the basic actors have also risen up and are negotiating with the company.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silk Factories Again Request Exemption from Improvement Fees</h3>
<p>The Xinyi Silk Factory and 20 other silk factories in this county have repeatedly held meetings to appeal for exemption from the improvement fee, and their attitude is firm. Because the Silk Factory Association does not seek the welfare of the industry, they have declared their withdrawal from the association. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00, the factories held another meeting, believing that the Suzhou Construction Department's additional levy of 6 yuan per dan of autumn cocoons is difficult to sustain. They should present their difficulties again and submit them to the Central Government, the Provincial Government, and the Departments, requesting relief and a halt to the collection, and exempting all taxes in order to maintain their businesses.</p>
<h3>Private Settlement of Opium Pill Offender Sent to Provincial Capital for Trial</h3>
<p>Zhu Panquan, a plainclothes investigator from the second platoon of the county's Public Security Bureau's Investigation Team, colluded with Zheng Chao, the former captain of the second company of the police brigade, and Tu Zheng Xi Xuechang, hooligan Lin Rongquan, Wang Laowu, etc., on the evening of the 26th of last month, and went to the home of Zhou Rongquan, a well-known opium pill manufacturer in Tianshang City An Di Li, posing as inspectors. They secretly seized a large number of opium pills. After mediation, it was agreed that 1,000 yuan would be the condition for a private settlement. At that time, 600 yuan was paid first, and the remaining 400 yuan was the responsibility of the township head Jiang Yingsheng. Chen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, learned about this and ordered Zhong Jihe, the captain of the Investigation Team, to investigate strictly. Captain Zhong arrested Zhu Panquan, Zheng Chao, Jiang Yingsheng, Chen Quanfa and other four people, and sent them to the county government for trial. Section member Yu Quanqing repeatedly held court to interrogate them. The confessions of the offenders were cunning, and they firmly denied the incident of seizing pills for private settlement. Therefore, the four offenders were sent back to the Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday, ordering them to be sent to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for review. After receiving the order, Director Chen ordered several police officers to escort the four offenders to Zhenjiang early yesterday morning (8th) and send them to the Garrison Command for military law.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Murderer of Ten Years Ago Arrested</h3>
<p>Guo Jinyuan, Gao Lianbao and other bandits from Wu Yi killed Xiangmin Xu Baisheng in the 12th year of the Republic of China. Afterwards, Yan Pengcheng, a Hubei native, who lived in Wolong Township in the county and had relatives with Xu Baisheng, presented a petition to the official office to arrest the murderer, which resulted in another grievance with the bandits. On January 17th, the 14th year of the Republic of China, Yan Pengcheng and his wife were kidnapped by bandits Guo Jinyuan, Zhang Sanda, etc. while watching the lights in the nearby Land Temple. When they arrived at Xiaolonggangkou, they threw Yan Pengcheng and his wife into the river and drowned them. Then, Guo fled to another place and has not been arrested until now. Yan Changyun, Yan's son, has now grown up and is determined to avenge this irreconcilable hatred. He went out to investigate. Unexpectedly, the bandits were brought to justice. Guo and Zhang were sent to the county court for another bandit case. After Yan Changyun confirmed that it was true, he filed a lawsuit with the county court yesterday (7th) according to law, requesting that they be brought to justice in order to comfort his parents in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Nantong Jiangbei Drought Disaster Severe</h3>
<p>Since the rainfall in the Jiangbei Tong area and the Huainan reclamation area in the middle of last month, the weather has been extremely hot and clear, and the drought is now becoming severe again. Officials and people in Nantong are working together to set up a water station in Yaogang, open electric pumps, and draw river water to rescue the disaster.</p>
<h3>Haimen The Ministry of Justice Sends Personnel to Investigate the Case Against the Trial Officer</h3>
<p>Deng Gongsan, a trial officer in this county, has often acted improperly in handling lawsuits, which has led to the parties concerned accusing Deng in the High Court and the Ministry of Justice. Although Judge Long of the Nantong Court came to Hai to investigate, the true facts have not been obtained. Now that the Ministry of Justice believes that the trial officer has been repeatedly accused, it has specially commissioned the Bao Mountain County Magistrate to investigate. Xu Yingtu, a section member specially sent by the Bao Mountain County Magistrate, came to Hai the day before yesterday and stayed at the An Hotel. When a reporter visited him, he reported as follows: This time, I was ordered to come to Hai to investigate the case against the trial officer in your county. There are four cases, three criminal cases and one civil case, most of which belong to bribery and dereliction of duty. There is a case of a corpse in Songji Port. I have already gone to the scene to investigate in detail and reviewed all the documents in the county government. The facts are clear. The remaining three cases are still under serious investigation. Once all the cases are fully investigated, I must return to Bao and report.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Abuses the Elderly</h3>
<p>Yang Dabing, the director of the nursing home in this county, is engaged in business and has no time to advise on the affairs of the nursing home. Huang Gengxin and Lu Yousong are responsible for handling the affairs, but Huang and Lu often do not comply with the regulations and arbitrarily abuse the elderly. They only give porridge and wheat rice once a day, and withhold and do not pay the work wages. The day before yesterday, an old man surnamed Fan went to Huang et al. to recover the withheld wages, which angered him. He was tied to a pillar and severely whipped. Fan wailed for help, which was unbearable to hear. Then, all the elderly people pleaded for him, and he was released. Now, Chen Baigeng and 20 other people believe that Huang and Lu's actions are contrary to humanity. Yesterday (6th), they specially submitted a petition to the county government, requesting that they be strictly investigated.</p>
<h3>Water Conservancy Dispute Between Zhenjiang Jindan Counties</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Danyang farmers building a dam on the Xiangcao River to block the tide, harming the downstream water conservancy of Jintan, after vigorous efforts by various groups in Jintan, the provincial government has ordered Danyang County to dismantle the lower dam and reasonably reduce the upper dam. However, after many days, the Danyang County Magistrate Yan has not complied, and the people downstream in Jintan are desperate due to the water shortage. Public sentiment is stirred, and they all want to go to open the dam themselves. Considering the serious situation, the Jintan representative stationed in the provincial capital is deeply concerned that the people will take risks. Therefore, he is still making every effort to request the provincial authorities to send a special commissioner to open the dam to avoid causing trouble.</p>
<h3>The Su Family's Mouth in Funing Was Looted by Bandits</h3>
<p>At about 2 PM yesterday, in the Su Family's Mouth area of the tenth district of this county, bandits led by Xia Sandiedie, the staff officer of bandit Zhang Zhigao, suddenly appeared with 60-70 bandits, each armed with guns and bullets. They entered the town from North Street and surrounded the local police station. Police officer He Naijian led the police to resist, but they were outnumbered. The bandits occupied the town, looted wantonly, set fires, and kidnapped more than 80 men and women as hostages, heading northwest. Zhu Shoupeng, the leader of the guard detachment stationed in Fenggu Village, and the Yilin tax police and the Public Security Bureau heard the news and led teams to suppress them. They rescued more than 60 hostages halfway. The bandits fled to the Tongying area.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurred in Jiaxing Dongzha Town</h3>
<p>The home of Shen A'san in Tianjiwan, Dongzha Town, Jiaxing, was suddenly visited by eight robbers the night before last. Armed with weapons, five guarded the front door, and three entered the house to search and loot. They ransacked trunks and chests, stealing 40 silver dollars, 13 paper dollars, six carts of silk, and several pieces of gold jewelry. When a patrol police officer passed by, the robbers immediately fled. Although they were pursued, nothing was gained.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Mr. Sun Jingya</h3>
<p>To the editors of Shen Bao, Greetings. Your newspaper published on the 7th of this month, "Hong Kong telegram: Shanghai commissioner Sun Jingya arrived in the province on the 5th and visited various committees of the political assembly on the 6th to exchange opinions on the Fifth Plenary Session." It has been mistakenly reported from Hong Kong that I went to Guangdong five or six times in the past few months. It seems that someone is deliberately spreading false information. I don't know what the purpose is. I am writing specifically to request a correction. Respectfully, Sun Jingya, August 8th.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Passed Shanghai Eastward Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Only the left wing with a force of six winds swept over the city.</p>
<p>High tides caused water accumulation in low-lying roads.</p>
<p>Ordinary buildings suffered minor damage, and navigation resumed.</p>
<p>The hurricane that approached Shanghai in recent days passed over Shanghai yesterday morning and continued to move northwest-west, remaining at sea. At 10 AM yesterday, the hurricane reached the east side of Daji Mountain, about 80 miles from Shanghai. According to the report from the Daji Mountain Observatory received by the Xujiahui Observatory, from 6 AM to 9 AM on the 8th, the north wind reached a force of ten, which is rarely encountered inland. It is strong enough to uproot trees and cause other damage. The speed of ten winds can reach 53 to 63 miles per hour. When the hurricane approached Shanghai yesterday morning, the Huangpu River was surging wildly, and no ships were sailing on the river. Fortunately, it did not reach the city, so the wind gradually subsided in the afternoon, and the heat wave was greatly reduced. The highest temperature yesterday was only 81.5 degrees, which is almost 20 degrees lower than Sunday (99.7).</p>
<p>Swept Over Shanghai</p>
<p>This time, the two hurricanes merged in the Pacific Ocean, so their strength was very great, reaching as many as ten winds. At 10 AM yesterday, the observatory reported that the main force of the hurricane had reached Daji Mountain at 31 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, outside the eastern port of Shanghai, with a force of ten. The wind speed was 27 meters per second, or 97 kilometers per hour, and the direction was north-northwest or north. At 11 AM, the direction was north-northwest, so only the left wing of the hurricane swept over Shanghai, with a total of six winds. The observatory reported again at 2 PM yesterday that the left wing of the hurricane had passed Shanghai, and its main force was at 32 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading north-northeast, crossing the Yellow Sea, and blowing towards Korea.</p>
<p>High Tide</p>
<p>After the hurricane swept over Shanghai yesterday afternoon, it was blowing in the ocean, fortunately not landing, so the city and inland areas did not suffer wind damage, but the coastal areas must have suffered some damage. The Huangpu River in Shanghai rose due to the seawater being blown in by the wind, causing the river to rise. At about 5 AM yesterday, the Bund and North Sichuan Road were flooded with water reaching several inches, but it quickly receded.</p>
<p>Customs Warning</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs received a report from the observatory the night before last that the hurricane had blown to the Wenzhou sea area. To avoid misfortunes for ships on the Jianghai River, a black mark was specially hung on the roof, and two red lights were lit at the same time to warn ships to stop entering and leaving the Wusongkou. It was changed to a black cross warning ball yesterday morning, indicating that the hurricane was approaching the city. The black ball was removed at 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>Damage Overview</p>
<p>Although the main force of the hurricane did not reach the city yesterday, its left wing still had a strong wind force of six, causing damage to many ordinary buildings in the East Shanghai area. In particular, telephone lines in Wusong, Zhenru, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and road construction areas outside the concession were mostly blown off and could not be connected. The telephone company sent personnel to repair them in separate locations, and all were repaired by the afternoon. There were also some telephone poles and trees that were uprooted, and many store signs on various roads were destroyed.</p>
<p>Overturned Boat in Huangpu River</p>
<p>At about 11 AM yesterday, Chen Shifa (33 years old) from Hubei was newly piloting a kiln cargo ship from north to south, passing the Huangpu River surface at the Jiuda Pier in Nanshi. At that time, a hurricane hit Shanghai, with heavy rain and huge waves. The ship was weak and could not withstand it, and it overturned. A large number of kiln goods and the shipowner and crew on board also fell into the river, shouting for help. The water patrol team of the local Municipal Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately sent captains Zhu and Li, leading a large number of police officers, on patrol boats to the scene. They rescued many crew members, including Shao Changmu, and recovered many kiln goods that had sunk to the bottom of the river. However, the shipowner Chen Shifa and his partner Song Xianghe disappeared after falling into the river. At the time, the police thought they had been swept away by the huge waves and had no chance of survival. Unexpectedly, at about 1 PM, several ruffians saw that the bottom of the ship was facing the sky, floating on the river surface, and no one was guarding it. They immediately went forward and used iron tools to dig a large hole in the bottom of the ship, planning to steal items. Suddenly, they saw two men in the cabin of the ship. When the ship overturned, they were in the cabin and could not escape, and they could not pry open the bottom of the ship, so they were suffocated in the cabin, with their eyes closed, waiting for death to come. The ruffians tried to rescue them from the water, and they were able to be reborn. Upon questioning, they were identified as the shipowner Chen Shifa and his partner Song Xianghe. However, when the ship overturned, it sank to the bottom of the river and then floated up, drifting on the river surface for a total of two hours. Chen and the others were suffocated in the cabin, immersed in water, but did not drown. It can be said to be a miracle.</p>
<p>Collapsed Walls and Sheds</p>
<p>(1) The house of the Zhao family at No. 1, Jiwu Lane, Fangbang Road, in the city, collapsed due to disrepair and old age. At about 1 PM yesterday, a brick wall behind the Zhao family's house suddenly collapsed due to wind and rain, crushing many sundries such as tables and stools. Fortunately, no one was injured. (2) Yan Xinglong, 33 years old, from Changzhou, has been running a stove at No. 249, Fangbang Road, in the city. At about 10 AM yesterday, when the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, the east wall of the stove suddenly collapsed. At that time, Qiu Delin from Nanjing was sipping tea there and could not escape. He was crushed under the rubble and seriously injured. Yan Xinglong saw it and quickly called his colleagues to rescue Qiu and sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. (3) Yao Lansheng, 30 years old, a local resident, lives at No. 62, Gaodun Road, in the city. Recently, due to the hot weather, he built a reed shed in his courtyard to block the sunlight. Unexpectedly, at about 9 AM yesterday, when the hurricane came, the shed was weak and could not withstand it and collapsed, pressing on the chimney on the roof of the neighboring Liu family at No. 60. However, the chimney was made of brick and mud and was already old, so it collapsed and fell into the courtyard of Sun Lizhi (35 years old) from Yangzhou at No. 58 next door. At that time, Sun happened to be standing there, so the broken bricks fell on Yao's head, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse to the ground unconscious. Sun's family heard the sound and rushed over and quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Ningbo Ships Suspended</p>
<p>The Ningbo passenger ship Ningxing of the Sanbei Company had already boarded passengers the day before yesterday. When they received the observatory's announcement that the hurricane was blowing from Ningbo to Shanghai, the company immediately announced that the Ningxing would suspend its voyage and stop exporting. At that time, the passengers were quite dissatisfied and negotiated with the crew. After the shipowner declared the danger of sailing, the tickets were returned. The Taikoo New Beijing and Ningshao Ningshao ships from Ningbo to Shanghai did not sail because the hurricane had arrived in Ningbo by 10 AM on the 7th. Taikoo Ningshao Ningbo flights have no ships to Ningbo today.</p>
<p>Returned Midway</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's New Jiangtian ship departed from Shanghai at 4:30 PM on the 7th. When it reached outside Sanjia Water, the ship received a warning from the observatory that the hurricane was about to hit head-on. The shipowner of the New Jiangtian received the news and ordered the ship to turn back. It was already late at night, but the hurricane was encountered on the way back. Fortunately, the express ship returned to Shanghai quickly, but the passengers on board were deeply unhappy. The ship is now scheduled to depart for Ningbo again at 4 PM today.</p>
<p>Fujian Ships Blocked</p>
<p>The sea ships sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou on the 7th included Qingpu, Songpu, Shengan, Wanxiang, Guangli, and Gongping. When they sailed outside Wusongkou, each sea ship received a strong wind warning from the observatory and chose a safe sea area outside Wusongkou to anchor and avoid the wind. Yesterday, each ship sent a telegram to Shanghai reporting that it had not yet departed and would depart after the wind subsided. There were also many sea ships to Fujian that postponed their departure date due to the hurricane.</p>
<p>Sea Ships Sheltering from the Wind</p>
<p>The sea ships sailing from Shanghai to the North and South Oceans the day before yesterday, and the ships sailing from Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Yantai, and Tianjin to Shanghai, which were supposed to enter the port yesterday, were blocked by the hurricane and did not dare to venture. In total, there were more than 20 sea ships entering and leaving the port, anchoring and sheltering from the wind outside Wusongkou, from Sanjia Water, Tongsha, to the Sheshan Ocean area. Therefore, only three sea ships, Yichang and others, entered Wusong yesterday afternoon, and four ships, Shihe, Anqing, Xingshi, and Ruihe, came from the Yangtze River. The customs patrol ship Haijing also returned to Shanghai after patrolling at sea. As for the departing ships, in addition to the four ships Longhe, Shashi, Jiangjing, and Jiahe from the Yangtze River, the sea ship Taikoo's Jinan has been changed to depart tomorrow morning. The others are Dala's Grand President and a Japanese ship going to the ocean.</p>
<p>Inspecting Seawalls</p>
<p>At about 1 AM yesterday, Wusongkou was invaded by a hurricane. The tide rose sharply, and the rain was heavy at dawn, with waves surging. The sailing ships in the Songkou Huangpu River all took refuge in the inner harbor. The Baotaiwan lighthouse and weather vane all had special warnings to ensure safe navigation. The Baoshan seawall has been repaired by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the project is 70-80% complete. It is said that it can be fully completed before the tide of this session (August 3rd of the lunar calendar). It is currently being rushed to complete. However, the seawalls in the Wusong area have many breaches since the Japanese artillery fire on January 28th. Local groups have been worried about this and have repeatedly appealed for repairs, but the Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that it is not yet necessary, so it has not been implemented. It is now heard that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has officially tendered for the East and West seawall projects, and it will likely begin construction soon. Yesterday afternoon, Wusong party and government leaders Wang Cheng'e, Tang Zuanzhi, Wu Renqi, Yao Guangnai, Yin Gongtian, and others personally went to inspect the current status of the seawalls along the Outer Bund and Baotaiwan area.</p>
<p>River Preparedness</p>
<p>Although the Jianghai Customs hurricane warning black cross was removed at noon, the remaining wind in Shanghai was still strong. Barges, civilian ships, small ships, sampans, boats, etc. on the Huangpu River are still on alert. Those who sailed into Suzhou Creek and Laogang to shelter from the wind have not yet departed by yesterday afternoon. There was very little cargo barging to and fro on the river.</p>
<p>Cotton Damaged</p>
<p>Cotton is currently being harvested, and a hurricane is sweeping the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with very strong winds, causing many flowers and fruits to be blown off. Weak branches are also easily broken, causing unsustainable losses for farmers. Yesterday, the cotton market price on the Yarn and Cloth Exchange rose by 40-50 cents, both near and far.</p>
<p>Power Pole Blown Down</p>
<p>West of Huta Road, a wooden power line pole suddenly fell down at about 7 AM yesterday due to the hurricane. A boy named Chen Xiaosanzi from Jiangbei, about six or seven years old, happened to be passing by and was suddenly struck in the head, causing his skull to shatter and bleed profusely. He immediately fell to the ground and died. Passersby saw it and quickly reported it to the police officer at the post, who transferred it to the local Tu Dibao to report to the local court for verification.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, came to Shanghai for medical treatment due to illness and has been here for many days. Now that Yu's condition has improved and he has regained his health, and the affairs of the Yuan need to be handled personally, he took the night express train to Beijing last night. Accompanying Yu were Chu Minyi and Chen Ce.</p>
<h3>Hu Shize Embarked on a Ship to Europe Last Night</h3>
<p>Personally carrying the League of Nations General Assembly proposal</p>
<p>Delivered to Chief Representative Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>Hu Shize, China's Minister to Switzerland, previously requested leave to return to China and visited Foreign Minister Wang to ask for instructions. Now, the 15th League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in Geneva on September 10th. China's proposal will be personally carried by Hu and handed to Chief Representative Guo Taiqi. Therefore, Hu boarded the Italian postal ship Conte Verde at the New Customs Wharf at 2 AM last night. The ship is scheduled to depart for Europe at 6 AM this morning. Among those traveling on the same ship are Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, and Zhao Zukang, a representative sent by the National Government to attend the 7th International Road Conference.

<p>Ford Aircraft</p>
<h3>Comes to Shanghai to Welcome Kong Xiangxi</h3>
<p>Kong is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi today</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, originally planned to return to Nanjing and then go to Lushan the day before yesterday. However, he suddenly contracted heatstroke and coughed the day before yesterday, so he was unable to make the trip. It is now known that the Ford aircraft sent by Chairman Chiang to welcome him arrived in Shanghai at dusk the day before yesterday and landed at Hongqiao Airport. Kong was preparing to take the plane from Shanghai yesterday morning, but since yesterday morning, there was a sudden wind and rain, making it inconvenient to fly. It was decided that if the weather is clear again today, he will take the plane.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Southwest Political Committee</p>
<h3>Abolish Special Taxes on Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The boycott of yarn factories in China should be clearly defined.</p>
<p>It is inappropriate to make domestic goods manufacturers perish together.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday (briefly): "On the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the China Chemical Industry Society, stating that it was heard that Guangdong industry and commerce, citing that Shanghai factories mostly have foreign investment and dumped goods in Guangdong, vigorously advocated and demanded that the provincial authorities implement taxes to protect the local industry. It was also heard that the local chambers of commerce had been convened by the authorities and agreed to set up a bureau to collect special taxes on imported goods and goods imported from outside the province. Please quickly telegraph the provincial authorities to inquire about the details and request the cancellation of the original proposal to collect special taxes on domestic goods in order to protect national products." The Chamber of Commerce investigated that Chinese merchants' machines imitating foreign goods had preferential treatment during the Qing Dynasty Lijing was not reduced, only when exported a positive tax of one in one hundred and five was completed, they can pass through the whole country and avoid re-levy. Now that Lijing has been cut, national products, whether they are natural products or manufactured products, except when they are transshipped, pay a transshipment tax at the first customs according to regulations, and no other taxes are collected between provinces. This is a good policy for merchants after the reduction of Lijing. The bad system left over from the former Qing Dynasty for more than 70 years has just been deleted, how can it be restored? If according to the suggestions of the Guangdong industry and commerce community, the special tax is in name, but in reality Lijing, it is contrary to the policy of promoting domestic goods. And in terms of the current special tax system in Guangdong Province, it is only limited to foreign goods, and if the scope is expanded, it will make domestic goods suffer the same destruction. At a time when commerce is depressed, only South China has a dense population and a relatively stable order, and there is still room for commodity promotion. If special tax barriers are also set up and strict prevention and control are carried out, then our country's commodities will be rejected abroad and again rejected at home. Surrounded on all sides and unable to move, how can industry not perish together? Assuming that the authorities of all provinces hear the news and rise up in response, competing in the name of protecting local products and imposing special taxes on goods from outside the province, wouldn't the goods from Guangdong Province sold to all provinces be affected in the same way? Careful consideration of both sides may not be beneficial to the industry and commerce of Guangdong Province. Tracing the origin of this idea, it is nothing more than that Shanghai factories inevitably have foreign establishments. Then the conclusion is still in maintaining national factories and resisting foreign factories. It is more appropriate to clearly distinguish the boundaries and not to lump them together. For example, there are also national factories that are set up in Hong Kong, how can they be regarded as foreign goods because they come from Hong Kong? Moreover, foreign merchants have the right to set up factories in China in all treaty ports, not only in Shanghai. The new industries run by Chinese people are mostly located in treaty ports for the convenience of using power. Once this end is opened, the industrial products of any port in the country will not be able to be sold in Guangdong Province due to heavy taxes, and the damage is more than just Shanghai. According to what the Chamber of Commerce has heard, foreign merchants have set up factories in Shanghai. Except for the textile industry, which is more common, and the cigarette industry, which is more influential, which one of the others is more Chinese factories and fewer foreign factories? The tax authorities in charge of taxes have records to check and can easily check. If Guangdong Province is using the maintenance of national factories as a policy, it seems that it should conduct a detailed investigation and strictly define the scope to avoid losing the overall situation and making national products fall into a position that is difficult to recover forever. Based on the foregoing, I dare to represent all the domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai to make urgent appeals. I only hope that you will preside over the matter. If the special tax item is inevitable, it is necessary to handle it carefully, so that domestic goods manufacturers will not be implicated and perish together. It is fortunate. Shanghaishi Chamber of Commerce bowed and praised,</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Instructions to the Bankers Association</h3>
<p>No violation of the Savings Law is allowed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association believes that according to the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated and implemented by the National Government, each savings bank should deposit one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits in government bonds and treasury bills calculated at the market price to the Central Bank for safekeeping, and obtain a receipt for submission to the Ministry for verification. This is practically difficult to implement. The Ministry of Finance was previously asked to postpone the implementation. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance, after receiving the report, specially instructed the Bankers Association yesterday that the request for a postponement of implementation is difficult to approve. The reporter from Xinxin News Agency now finds and records the original text of its instructions as follows: Ministry of Finance Instructions, Shanghai Money Letter No. 1, to the Shanghai Banking Industry Association, a report, for the savings bank law has not been decided before, for the Article 9 of the law, the depositing of public debt treasury bills section, intended to humbly ask for a postponement of implementation, report received, check the submission of government public debt treasury bills, in order to protect the interests of savings depositors, increase the credibility of the bank, not only the savings bank law clearly stipulates, namely each bank's self-established savings regulations, approved by the Ministry, also have the same regulations, Now the Savings Bank Law, the National Government has already promulgated and implemented, the Ministry should follow the regulations, and each bank's self-established regulations should not be violated. The request for a postponement of implementation should not be discussed. This custody method has also been requested by the Ministry in a letter to the Central Bank to properly stipulate. The types and numbers of assets that guarantee credibility should be verified by the Ministry at any time, and each bank should follow the instructions. There is absolutely no inconvenience. As for the various points in the proposed amendment to the Savings Bank Law that are difficult to implement, they are not related to Article 9 and have been submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for consultation. Together, please know. This order,</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance</p>

<p>Japanese Embassy Spokesperson</p>
<h3>Denies Arimaya's Passivity</h3>
<p>There is also no intention to return home.</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency said that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arimaya, had once been rumored to be dismissed. Later, this saying gradually subsided. However, in the past two days, the Japanese newspapers have once again carried that Arimaya suddenly had the intention to resign and planned to return to China in September. The successor will be Tani Masao, the current councillor of the Puppet Embassy. A reporter from the Far East News Agency went to the Japanese Embassy yesterday to find out what was going on. The spokesperson solemnly denied to the reporter that all the rumors were pure speculation and were not worth believing. Moreover, the ambassador has no intention of returning to China in September.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Tax Reduction Period for County Deeds for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has now received an order from the province that the land and house deed tax, a reduction of six parts and three of the micro-sale, has been on trial for three months since May and is now limited. A special extension of three months to the end of October is intended to reflect both solicitude and warning. After receiving the order, the county government, in addition to the announcement, yesterday also ordered the district township public office to notify each household that all untaxed white deeds under the name of the public should come to the county to pay the tax in full during the tax reduction period. If the deadline is not paid, it will still be collected according to the original tax rate, plus a penalty.</p>

<p>The silk industry is on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>The Five Silk Mills Suspend Operations Again</h3>
<p>Stabilizing Silk Prices is Underway</p>
<p>Representatives from the Ministry of Industry Will Arrive in Shanghai Shortly</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that of the silk mills in Shanghai that are barely managing to operate, only thirty-three remain. Due to substantial losses, they are unable to sustain operations. Following the recent closure of three mills, five more were forced to shut down yesterday, exacerbating the precarious situation. The Ta Kung Pao reporter continued to inquire from various sources, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five More Mills Forced to Close</p>
<p>Recently, the Jiyu Silk Mill on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, the Yutong Silk Mill on Meiyuan Road, and the Yingfeng Silk Mill on Tanjiaqiao, all closed on the first of this month due to losses exceeding 20,000 yuan per mill within a month of operation, making it impossible to continue. Yesterday, five more mills announced their closure: Heji and Tongyi on Tiantong Road in Hongkou, Fuxing and Dechang in Zhabei, and Jingwei in the concession area. Only twenty-five mills in the city are still barely operating, and it is feared that they will also close down in the coming week. They are currently rushing to reel the remaining dry cocoons to prepare to pay off the remaining wages, it is said.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Silk Prices is Underway</p>
<p>Silk mill operators from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai previously held a joint meeting in Shanghai to seek temporary relief for the silk industry. They resolved to appoint Shen Huachen, Jiang Laixian, Qin Youhe, and others as representatives to negotiate with various parties on ways to stabilize silk prices. At that time, progress was stalled because Cai Shengbai, chairman of the Silk Weavers' Guild, was away from Shanghai on business. Yesterday, the Ta Kung Pao reporter met with Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Mill Operators' Guild, who stated that he had contacted Cai Shengbai and others regarding stabilizing silk prices, and they expressed considerable sympathy. However, the matter is of great importance and requires careful planning to achieve effective results. Therefore, further consultations are needed in the coming days before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Ministry of Industry Will Arrive in Shanghai Shortly</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministries of Finance and Industry to formulate four measures to aid the silk industry in Shanghai, and to implement them separately. The first measure, exempting all local taxes on silkworm cocoons and factory silk, is to be handled by the provincial and municipal governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The second measure, reducing silk cocoon transportation costs, is to be handled by the Ministries of Transportation and Railways. The third measure is to request the National Economic Council to establish a Silk Industry Control Council as soon as possible. The fourth measure, concerning fundraising or issuing public bonds, is of great importance and requires further consultation. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry, in order to expedite relief efforts, has sent Liu Yinfu, Director of the Department of Industry, to Shanghai for investigation. Mr. Liu is expected to arrive in Shanghai shortly to consult with Mayor Wu and the silk mill operators' association before making a decision, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Await Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>It is Said That the Existing Rice Reserves</p>
<p>Can Only Last for One Month</p>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai remains high due to the worsening drought in various regions. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Jiang Shizhi, chairman of the Rice Grain Association, yesterday, who provided an overview of the grain situation, which is detailed below:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Price Hike</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang first stated that the reasons for the high rice prices in Shanghai are: (1) Wuhu's ban on rice exports; (2) Hunan's increase in grain export taxes; (3) the worsening drought in various regions; (4) high prices of flour and wheat; (5) the military headquarters purchasing 20,000 shi of indica rice, which is still ongoing. Due to these five factors, the supply has decreased, and demand has increased, leading to speculation and hoarding. Although the market price is nominally 13 yuan, the unofficial price has already reached 13.70 yuan. This month is also a period of scarcity before the new harvest, so the price surge is just gaining momentum.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice is Coming</p>
<p>He continued, saying that the banking industry and the rice industry have ordered foreign rice from Saigon. The total order amounts to 150,000 shi for the banking industry and 200,000 shi for the rice industry. 100,000 shi are expected to arrive this month, and the rest will be imported next month. Currently, the selling price in Saigon is 12 yuan. The cost of the first batch ordered by the banking and rice industries is 10.30 yuan, and the second batch is 11.40 yuan. Therefore, there is no profit to be made from the second batch. It is heard that the banking industry's rice will be hoarded in anticipation of price increases. Tongli japonica rice has already been sold for 12.40 yuan. This year, Tongli rice was originally 4 yuan cheaper than Changbang (i.e., top-grade white rice). Therefore, the current market price of 13 yuan for top-grade white rice is still considered restrained. If it were according to reason, it should be sold for 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves in Shanghai</p>
<p>Finally, he said that the current reserves of top-grade white rice in Shanghai total 300,000 shi. The four rice mills have a reserve of 10,000 packages, and the Xieji Company has a reserve of 8,000 packages. These are all indica, japonica, and glutinous rice, totaling over 400,000 shi for the entire city. However, this grain is not suitable for use in other areas. Assuming a daily consumption of 15,000 shi for the entire city, it can only last for one month. The foreign warehouses between Xinzhalan Bridge and Xinqiao in the new garbage bridge area still have 100,000 shi of rice held as collateral. The foreign warehouses in Pudong still have Hunan indica, Jiangxi japonica, Anhui indica, Saigon indica, and small broken rice from three years ago, totaling over 100,000 shi. If we desire stabilized rice prices, we must wait for foreign rice to arrive in Shanghai before we can expect a price drop, he said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee</p>
<h3>Yesterday Hosted the Press</h3>
<p>Reporting on Various Agreed Upon Measures with the Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the resolution of the rickshaw dispute in the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Management Committee hosted news reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 PM yesterday to explain the benefits of the new regulations for rickshaw owners and pullers. Chairman Massey denied any passive intent and simultaneously announced the application status of new applicants, stating that there were no remaining licenses. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Massey's Report</p>
<p>Massey, Chairman of the Rickshaw Management Committee, met with reporters at the Shanghai Municipal Council's office on Jiangxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, translated by Zhu Maodeng. He said that he was very pleased with the measures agreed upon by both parties regarding new rickshaws. The mission of the Committee is to alleviate the suffering of rickshaw pullers and to promote the welfare of society, with no other intentions. As for the reports that he could not implement his personal ideas and expressed a passive attitude, he had no such intention and no reason to resign. (Note from the Xin Sheng News Agency: Massey's passive statement was rumored by the rickshaw owners, who said that Mr. Massey made this statement at the equal meeting held by the Shanghai Municipal Council on Monday.)</p>
<p>Mutual Aid and Relief</p>
<p>Regarding the Mutual Aid and Relief Association, there is a council consisting of ten directors, four foreigners and six Chinese. The licensed rickshaw owners and registered rickshaw pullers each send two representatives to supervise the use of funds. Whether to add more directors in the future will depend on the situation. The rickshaw owners have also clearly understood this mutual aid fund for rickshaw pullers and hope for cooperation from all parties. Mutual aid for rickshaw pullers is helping oneself, not charity. There are many misunderstandings about this point outside. Registered rickshaw pullers, in case of illness or accidents, can request relief from the Mutual Aid and Relief Association. Those who are not genuinely licensed rickshaw pullers cannot enjoy this right.</p>
<p>Registered Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the new regulations, the reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council accepted the rickshaw owners' conditions are completely misunderstood. The Shanghai Municipal Council has not abandoned the principles of improving rickshaw designs and various other aspects. The renting, selling, and mortgaging of rickshaw licenses completely contradict the new and old regulations. A license, with a rickshaw worth 70 yuan, could be sold for 700 yuan. Those who profited without labor were all created by the rickshaw pullers working like cattle and horses. Therefore, the new regulations stipulate that only genuine rickshaw owners can obtain a license. To avoid these abuses, the deadline has been extended to the 13th. Licenses will not be issued without proof of ownership, so that rickshaw owners can truly benefit. Those concerned about the reform of rickshaws can contribute their questions or opinions to the Committee as much as possible. The Committee will not hold any prejudice.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Rental Standard</p>
<p>After the new regulations were resolved in a bilateral meeting, the daily rickshaw rental is 7 jiao and 8 fen of silver dollars, plus 7 fen for the mutual aid fund. In addition, rickshaw owners must pay 1.50 yuan per month for the mutual aid fund. The rickshaw pullers have also expressed to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee that they are still paying an excess of 1 jiao and 1 fen of small dollars per day and requested a reduction. Due to the fluctuating price of silver dollars, this amount was set at the request of the rickshaw owners. The 10 jiao of small dollars set by the research association last year is equivalent to 7 jiao and 8 fen of silver dollars. Therefore, to ensure that neither party suffers a loss, it was set as silver dollars. As for the 40,000 registered rickshaw pullers, outsiders do not understand and say that there are over 100,000 rickshaw pullers, which is not enough. This is a misunderstanding. If a rickshaw puller returns to his hometown, the licensed rickshaw pullers, if there are not enough, can apply to the Committee for a license at any time, without worry.</p>
<p>New Rickshaw Style</p>
<p>As for the improved new rickshaw style, seven new styles have been submitted and are being inspected at the Transport Office, with economy, durability, and aesthetics as the criteria. A decision will be made in about two weeks. The rumor that all rickshaws in the city must be replaced after the new rickshaw style is approved is a misunderstanding. Existing rickshaws must be inspected by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Transport Office after two months. If the inspection reveals that they are old and dilapidated or the rickshaw body is not sturdy, they must be eliminated and replaced with new rickshaws. If the entire city were to be completely replaced, it would take several years to be uniform. Therefore, the rickshaw owners should not view it as a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners in the Special District</p>
<h3>Started Receiving Licenses Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Affairs Committee Notified Newly Registered Rickshaw Owners Yesterday</p>
<p>The Old Rickshaw Owners Have Complied with the Regulations and There Are No Remaining Licenses</p>
<p>After the resolution of the rickshaw problem in the Public Concession, the rickshaw owners in the Special District started receiving licenses yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, believing that the old rickshaw owners have complied with the regulations and there are likely no remaining licenses, notified the newly registered rickshaw owners yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Old Rickshaw Owners Receiving Licenses</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Association, believing that all issues have been resolved satisfactorily, has been busy for the past two days issuing the lower part of the application form for the Shanghai Municipal Council that was previously submitted by the rickshaw owners, so that its member rickshaw owners can receive their licenses as soon as possible. The rickshaw owners who have received the lower part of the form took it to the Committee yesterday morning to exchange it for a rickshaw owner's certificate, and then went to the Donation Office and Transport Office to pay the donation and receive the business license for August. The Association also sent several representatives to the Committee to assist in issuing the new certificates.</p>
<p>New Rickshaw Owners Eliminated</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee had previously invited the public who were willing to comply with the regulations and apply for public rickshaw licenses to submit applications, in case there were remaining licenses that could be distributed. A large number of people applied at that time. Now, because the old rickshaw owners are willing to comply with the Council's regulations, and the Council has extended the deadline for issuing rickshaw owner's certificates to allow them to do so, it is feared that there will be no remaining licenses to give to the new applicants. The Committee has now notified the applicants of this situation.</p>
<p>Postal Savings Bureau</p>
<h3>Allocates 1.5 Million Yuan to Aid Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Plans to Establish Farmer Loan and Remittance Agencies on a Trial Basis in Post Offices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, in order to aid the rural economy, has allocated 1.5 million yuan from the savings fund to establish farmer loan and remittance agencies on a trial basis in post offices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces: (1) Farmer Loan Department; (2) Farmer Remittance and Transfer Department. The aim is to provide low-interest loans to farmers and facilitate the circulation of agricultural products in various regions to stimulate finance. The post offices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been ordered to start preparations and it is expected to be implemented soon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Exports to the United States in July</h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Evening News reports that the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai announced statistics stating that the total value of goods shipped from Shanghai to the United States in July was US$607,400. The total value of Shanghai's exports to the United States in the first seven months of this year reached $7,221,382. Textiles topped the list of exports in July, valued at $358,429, followed by plant foods and beverages, valued at $106,248, and inedible animals and animal products, valued at $89,797. Exports in July included 658,561 pounds of tea, valued at $103,008. Silver coins shipped to the U.S. that month totaled 1,427,257 pounds, valued at US$587,705. The total value of goods shipped from Shanghai to the Philippines in July was US$116,121, with a total of $728,109 for the first seven months of this year. Goods shipped to Hawaii that month were valued at US$4,146, with a total of $28,656 for the first seven months of this year.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Questioning the Reason for Increased House Tax</h3>
<p>Arbitrarily Increasing the Original House Tax Contradicts the Regulations</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, which reads: Respectfully, according to a letter from taxpayer Fan Xiaoling, regarding the illegal and unreasonable increase in house tax by the Donation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council: I, Fan Xiaoling, rent a three-story building at No. 10, Lane 397, Jiujiang Road. The front door is inside the lane, and the back door faces Jiujiang Road. The monthly rent is 176.22 yuan, and the quarterly house tax is 73.50 yuan. Recently, the three tenants in the downstairs wing rooms and back shed of the rented building, due to sluggish business, wanted to maintain their business and facilitate customer access. They asked me to obtain the landlord's permission to open a doorway in the wall of the back shed facing the road. This was entirely intended to help them make a living, and the rent for the three tenants was not increased by a single cent. However, the Donation Office saw this as an opportunity to make money and suddenly increased the house tax by 21 yuan this quarter, to 94.50 yuan. I only learned of this when paying the tax. When I inquired at the Donation Office, they said that it was because a doorway had been added, and also because an investigation revealed that my rental income and expenses were sustainable. Based on a unilateral assumption, they concluded that the profit margin was high. Furthermore, they claimed that house tax is not based on rent. Calculating house tax based on the amount of rent has always been the established rule in the Public Concession and needs no further explanation. Even if the Donation Office has disregarded the established rules of the Shanghai Municipal Council and arbitrarily changed its common practice, there should still be a standard to follow when calculating house tax. If the rent of the building is used as a standard for types such as shops or residences, then, for example, if there are four buildings of the same size and with the same rent, one is rented to a bank, one is used as a shop, one has a store name, and one is a residence, will the house tax be divided into four different levels? Furthermore, if there are two equal buildings, one has one-third used as a shop and the rest as a residence, and the other has two-thirds used as a shop and the rest as a residence, what is the standard? If it is said that it does not depend on the size of the location but on the capital and business situation, then there are differences such as small shops with large capital, large shops with small capital, businesses with little capital but wide reach, and businesses with much capital but narrow reach. This means that the Donation Office will also be responsible for checking the account books of all shops in the district. As for the amount of rental income, the Donation Office has no right to use it as an excuse. If the Donation Office believes that a tenant's income can offset expenses and thus increase the tax, then if the rental income is not enough to cover expenses, will the Donation Office be considerate enough to exempt or reduce the tax and provide additional subsidies to make up the difference? In addition to the monthly rent, the tenant must also bear the burden of house tax, electricity bill, doorman fee, repair fee, vacant rooms, the loss of rent owed by the three tenants, the depreciation of small rents and electricity meters, and the mental trouble, etc. The rental income of my building and all expenses are losing a lot. So is the Donation Office's tax rate based on the number of doors of the building? I am confused and unclear. I respectfully submit this request, hoping that you will forward it to the Donation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council and quickly change the arbitrarily increased amount of 94.50 yuan back to 73.50 yuan, so that I can pay the tax according to the regulations and fulfill the reasonable obligation of a resident taxpayer. Otherwise, before I receive a fair resolution, I can only temporarily deposit the unpaid amount of 73.50 yuan in the bank to clarify that the responsibility for the delay is not mine, etc., and submit an income and expense statement to the Association. After investigating the points mentioned in the letter, this Association believes that they are reasonable. With the actual amount of rent and the total donation, there should be no problem at all. If the aim is to increase revenue due to insufficient tax collection, instead of coming up with various reasons to squeeze the remaining shops, making it impossible for them to survive, why not implement the resolution of the Taxpayer Representative Assembly and collect taxes on vacant rooms, which would not contradict the regulations? As for the income and expense statement, there is no obligation to report it, but in order for your office to understand the financial situation of the taxpayer regarding rent, it is enclosed for your reference.</p>
<p>One Freight Car No. 4001</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Was Detained for Inspection</h3>
<p>The Medicinal Herbs Inside Emitted an Opium-Like Odor</p>
<p>It Was Only After Finding No Illegal Items That They Realized It Was a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Beiping Joint Transport freight car No. 4001, which departed from Beiping, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Government ordered the detention and inspection of a freight car containing medicinal herbs. However, no illegal items were found. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Opium Odor</p>
<p>When the road protection soldiers inspected freight car No. 45280, a 40-ton car, on the Jinpu Railway's Pukou Station before noon, an opium-like odor was emitted. The stationmaster was asked to open the door for inspection, but the station claimed that freight transported jointly could not be inspected en route. After arriving at the capital, the soldiers placed a seal on the car that read "Sealed by the soldiers of the Jinghu-Huhangyong Road Protection Soldier Detachment of the Soldier Headquarters, July 7." It was found that July was actually a mistake and should have been August.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Shanghai to Detain</p>
<p>The soldier detachment, in addition to reporting to the capital's Soldier Headquarters to telegraph Shanghai to inspect the car upon arrival, also sent soldiers to accompany the car to Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from the capital's Soldier Headquarters stating that one of the freight cars containing medicinal herbs on the Shanghai-Beiping Joint Transport freight car No. 4001 emitted an opium-like odor when passing through Pukou. They were asked to inspect it upon arrival in Shanghai. They immediately dispatched soldiers and police to the Maigen Road freight station yesterday morning, together with the railway police from both railways. When the car arrived at the station, it was unloaded, and the suspicious car was driven directly to the North Station and stopped on track No. 1.</p>
<p>Inspection Results</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters sent soldiers, together with police from the Public Security Bureau and railway police from both railways, one person each, to guard the car. At 12:00 noon, together with the freight owner, they opened the door for inspection on the spot. All the goods were opened, and the boxes and packages were thoroughly inspected. The inspection was completed at 2:00 PM. As a result, no illegal items were found. The medicinal herbs that emitted the opium-like odor, totaling 32 items, were all Chinese medicines such as codonopsis pilosula and honeysuckle. Due to the hot weather and moisture, they emitted an odor similar to opium, leading to a misunderstanding. Now, the goods have been either taken away by the freight owner or put into storage. The empty car has been attached to the Shanghai-Beiping freight car No. 4002 heading north.</p>
<p>National Artists</p>
<h3>Preparing to Establish a Productive Arts Society</h3>
<p>Using Science to Innovate China's Industrial Production</p>
<p>To Fuse Inherent Art with Modern Life</p>
<p>The art community in Shanghai has recently initiated the formation of a "Productive Arts Research Society," a joint organization of the national art and craft community. The list of founders includes Teng Gu (Nanjing), Dong Shouping (Shanxi), Chu Xiaoshi (Beiping), Zhou Xibao (Hangzhou), Yu Shujun (pattern designer), Lin Jianfeng (Nanyang), Qian Jiuding, Zhou Zugao, Teng Baiye (Shanghai), and others.

<h3>The Chinese Company of the Business Corps Again Receives Honors</h3>
<p>Once Again Wins the Japan Cup, Crowned Champion of the Entire Corps</p>
<p>The Chinese Company of the International Business Corps has always been very serious about various drills and shooting exercises. Therefore, it has repeatedly won championships in various competitions of the entire corps. A few days ago, the company won the National Efficiency Shield for this year, which has already been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the company received Corps Order No. 37 from headquarters yesterday, announcing that the Japan Silver Cup, the most difficult competition in the corps, has been won by our Chinese Company again this year. The news has spread, and everyone is excited. It is heard that the cup was donated by Japanese business groups in Shanghai and is awarded to the best team in the corps for the year. The competition is extremely complex and pays great attention to discipline and military conduct. Therefore, winning the cup not only earns the honor of being the best team in the country, but also allows the team to wear a special badge on their hats. The most important competitions in the corps throughout the year are the Efficiency Shield and the Japan Cup. Now that both have gone to the Chinese Company, is this not a great story? Therefore, the issuance of the Corps Order has become a beautiful tale among the corps' various national units. The dominance of the Chinese Company in the Business Corps is evident from this. Also, the recruitment of translators for the company is coming to an end. In recent days, many Shanghai merchants have gone to the company at No. 126 Hankou Road to request the regulations and register, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Products Showcase Competition</h3>
<p>Yifeng Display Last Two Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yifeng Enamel Factory's participation in the China Beauty Tobacco Company's National Products Showcase Competition has already lasted eight days. Due to the elegance and beauty of the showcase layout, and the appropriateness of the gifts for daily use, it has been deeply appreciated by all sectors.  Customers throng the China Beauty store, bustling and endless throughout the day. It is heard that the special prize is a complete set of seven-piece enamel彩帶細花 basins, of considerable value. Whoever purchases the most China Beauty cigarettes in total value within ten days can obtain this prize, hence the eagerness of competitors.</p>
<h3>Yin Atang Dies from Swallowing Raw Opium</h3>
<p>Yin Atang, a native of Ningbo, was nineteen years old and lived at 51 Yihe Lane, Lan Ni Du, Qingdong. He worked as an assistant to a chauffeur at 410 Rue Paul Beau, Route de Saulnier in the French Concession. That evening, he had an argument with the chauffeur over a trivial matter. Afterwards, Atang, in a fit of anger, suddenly had a pessimistic thought and secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. After being discovered, he was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to an overdose, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 9:00 PM yesterday. His body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<p>Shanghai County News Yesterday</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony of Minxin Building</h3>
<p>Former Mingxin Temple Bronze Bell Renamed Rest Bell</p>
<p>Three-Story Building on the West Side of Hu Min Road, North Bridge</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng Society, all sectors of Shanghai County, in order to preserve antiquities, have specially renovated the Mingxin Temple bell tower into the Minxin Building, and held an inauguration ceremony at the North Bridge County Government yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees included Shanghai County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia, Standing Committee Member of the County Party Department Zhang Jingye, Chief of the County Public Security Bureau Xu Minyin, Chief of the County Education Bureau Zhu Changlin, Huang Yunzhen of the County Property Committee, Yin Shisheng of the Shangsong Automobile Company, Lu Bohong of the China Merchants Electric Tram Company, and representatives from various county-level agencies and organizations such as Cao Jifu, Cha Housheng, and more than a hundred others. The meeting was chaired by Pan Zhongjia, with Cao Jifu as the recorder and Xu Yamin as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>Ceremony Order: (1) Everyone stands at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silent tribute; (6) Report; (7) Speech; (8) Unveiling; (9) Photography; (10) Ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>After the chairman reported that the meeting commenced and saluted as required, Chairman Pan Zhongjia reported: Today is the opening day of the Minxin Building, which has been renovated by our county. I am very honored that everyone has come from afar. It is a pity that the wind and rain have caused some regrets to this grand ceremony. Regarding the reconstruction of the Mingxin Temple, everyone should be aware that when the restoration was initiated in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic, it went through several twists and turns before construction could begin in June last year. It was completed on May 2nd of this year. It was originally planned to be unveiled earlier, but because this is the only achievement of North Bridge, a meeting was convened in Shanghai to propose management methods and utilization methods, and a committee was established, which delayed the unveiling until today. All expenses were purely donated by local communities in the county, totaling more than 7,000 yuan. According to the construction contract, there are still several hundred yuan remaining. Considering that what is lacking here is beverages, I plan to use the remaining amount to build a self-flowing well. From the winter of the 20th year, until now, two and a half years, I thank all sectors for their spiritual and material assistance. I, on behalf of Shanghai County, express my gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p>Representative speeches were followed by Zhang Jingye, Yin Shisheng and others reporting the brief history of the Minxin Building: According to the Mingxin Temple records, the bell tower was first built in the summer of the 17th year of Song Ningzong (Jiashen year), initially with an iron bell. In the 33rd year of Ming Jiajing (Jiayin year), it was abandoned due to Japanese pirate disturbances. It was rebuilt in the 14th year of Wanli (Bingxu year), and a large bronze bell was cast, which is the ancient bell preserved today. The bell is six feet tall, five feet in diameter, and engraved with inscriptions of the Ming Minister of Rites Lu Shusheng's assistance, with donor inscriptions and the names of benevolent men and women. In the sixth year of Chongzhen (Guiyou year), in June, it was destroyed by a hurricane. It was rebuilt in the sixteenth year. During the Kangxi and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty, it was repaired twice. Since the tenth year of Qianlong, it has been in disrepair for a long time. On September 2, in the 22nd year of the Republic, when a hurricane passed, the entire building collapsed at noon, and the pillars and stones were dismantled. Only the bell remained unscathed. Previously, in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic, local figures requested the county magistrate to gather celebrities to initiate fundraising for restoration, and a committee was organized with separate economic and engineering departments in charge of the matter. From January of the 21st year to March of the 22nd year, more than 5,730 yuan was collected in donations from public groups and private individuals. In June of the 22nd year, the county government invited bids for construction, shifting the foundation northward, about a hundred steps from the original site. Construction began in June and was completed in May of the following year. After the completion and acceptance of the work, the county government convened a meeting to discuss internal facilities management methods, naming it Minxin, and decided to hang the bell on the top floor for rest and general notification. The middle floor is used as a library, and the lower floor is used as an exhibition hall, for the public to visit and read. It is not only for the preservation of antiquities.</p>
<p>Guided Tour:  Magistrate Pan then led the crowd to the front of the building's gate, unveiled it, and entered. The building is 17.98 meters high, the platform is 15.53 meters wide, and the four sides are 8.83 meters wide. It is located on the west side of the Hu-Min Motor Road and is divided into three floors. The ground floor displays agricultural products, the second floor is a library, and the thousand-jin giant bell is hung in the center of the third floor, named the Rest Bell. The walls are inscribed by Wang Yiting and others with the characters "Bell Tower," "Thought-Provoking," "Clear Sounds Reach the Roots," and "A Hundred and Eight Together Reflect." Ascending the tower for a distant view, the scenery is picturesque. The tour ended at 5:00 PM, and everyone dispersed.</p>

<p>Japanese Residents</p>
<h3>Satisfied with Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Landlords Appease Foreigners</p>
<p>Why Do They Treat Our Compatriots This Way?</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News yesterday, the Rent Reduction Committee held a meeting at the United Association Office on the 8th.  The committee members reported on the progress of the rent reduction movement and discussed how to prevent landlords from raising rents again in the future. At the same time, they were satisfied that most landlords on North Sichuan Road have automatically reduced rents, so the Rent Reduction Movement Committee will be disbanded soon. It is now found that the implemented reductions are: Shigaota Road Mainland Lane reduced by 20%, Huayuan Lane 18.85%, Dongzhao Lane 15% to 20%, McNear Lane 15%, the Kabukai-za area 15%, and the Japanese Autonomous Association section of the houses owned by the Li and Yang families reduced by 12.5% to 20%. Also, places like Shigaota Road Qianai Lane, Fengle Lane, Arui Lane, Xuqing Lane, and Yong'an Lane generally agreed to reduce by 15%. Therefore, the Japanese Residents Committee believes that the goal has been achieved, and the movement has come to an end. The United Association Committee does not need to exist.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation Asks the Second Branch of the High Court</p>
<h3>To Strictly Ban Electric Torture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, stating: We respectfully inform you that the police have abused electric torture, harming the lives of citizens, as in the cases of Cai Yang and Chen Afu, the facts are obvious and the evidence is conclusive, undeniable. Since the cases of Cai and Chen have occurred, it is feared that countless others have suffered this cruel torture. This federation has repeatedly sent letters requesting a strict ban and has submitted them to the highest judicial authority for strict prohibition, all on file. The Ministry of Justice replied on July 26 with document number 1389, stating: One document submitted regarding the police's abuse of electric torture, requesting the court to pay attention to protect legal rights, has been received. The Shanghai Bar Association has previously submitted a complaint to the Ministry, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has been ordered to investigate and verify. Please be informed accordingly. After discussion by the Sixth Executive Committee of this federation, it was unanimously agreed that strictly prohibiting electric torture is a humanitarian proposition, and a letter should be sent again to your court to conduct a thorough investigation, to punish those detectives who directed the torture according to law, to permanently eliminate this scourge, to safeguard the lives of the people, and to respect humanity. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter, and we are deeply grateful for your friendship.</p>
<p>Russian Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Invites</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang to Perform in Russia</h3>
<p>Currently Being Prepared by the China Drama Promotion Society</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Others Invited to Serve as Directors</p>
<p>Promoting national glory and competing for international recognition depends on culture, and since Eastern and Western cultures are different, the only way to bridge the gap is through drama. In the past twenty years, foreigners traveling to China have gained a considerable understanding of our traditional drama and have competed to promote it. Mr. Mei Lanfang has also traveled to Japan twice and to the United States once, with brilliant results. This year, the Russian Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries plans to invite Mr. Mei to perform in Russia and has formally telegraphed its intention. However, since Mr. Mei's performance abroad requires a considerable organization, it has been delayed and has not yet become a reality. Now that this matter is gradually becoming more concrete, enthusiastic drama colleagues have organized the China Drama Promotion Society, with the specific purpose of promoting Chinese drama research, promotion, and performances abroad. It is planned to raise 100,000 yuan as the society's shares and to invite Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Feng Gengxian, Lu Jianquan, and others to serve as directors and begin preparing for the performance in Russia. The letter sent to the honorary directors is as follows: We respectfully inform you that Chinese drama has a long history, and its culture and art are entrusted to it. In these later years, its influence on education has declined, and the classics of music have been scattered. Every time we speak of it, we feel deeply regretful. Now that maritime restrictions have been lifted and voices compete with each other, there is even more importance to cultural exchange. Foreigners, in particular, have a deep interest in our drama. In recent years, Mr. Mei Lanfang has traveled to Japan twice and to the Americas once, and each time he has truly lived up to his name, earning great prestige. This shows that there is a growing need for communication between Chinese and foreign cultures, and since languages are different, drama is the only way to understand each other. Foreign dignitaries have explored it deeply and have advanced insightful theories, which is why. This time, the Russian Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries has telegraphed Mr. Mei, inviting him to perform, and the value of Eastern art and literature can be seen here. We do not dare to claim to be thin, but we want to promote it further, in order to promote the founding of this society. One is to study theatrical arts, and the other is to promote national glory. Organize a troupe, led by Mr. Mei, to perform Chinese drama abroad. According to historical records, Yu danced on the steps, and his influence on education spread far and wide. To take the example of recent times, the performance of Caruso has strengthened the friendship between the United States and Italy, and people's diplomacy is the beginning of this. It is not just to express the art of sound. We especially hope that you, who are highly respected in Confucian circles and whose names are known for their interpretations, will show sympathy for the organization of this society. Mr. Mei's trip abroad has been praised, so all the members of this society have unanimously elected you as honorary directors of this society. We earnestly ask you to share the brilliance of your virtues and spread the elegant music of our nation. In the prosperous age of music, there will be opportunities for meetings. The music of heaven will be shared, and carriages and books will be shared. We also hope you will give us your advice and supervise our education. We look forward to your guidance.</p>
<p>Li Shilin Mourns His Wife's Death After Childbirth</p>
<h3>Sues Women's Hospital Director and Doctor</h3>
<p>Second Special Court Holds Trial Yesterday, Medical Community Attends to Observe</p>
<p>Li Describes in Detail His Wife's Admission to the Hospital and Tragic Death</p>
<p>丨The court orders to summon Dr. Chen Jingxu for further questioning丨</p>
<p>Li Shilin, a local residing at No. 34 Shangxian Lane, Route de Saulnier in the French Concession and opening the Donghua Engineering and Construction Company on Beijing Road, is forty years old this year. His wife, Wang, is about thirty-five or six years old, and the couple has a deep affection for each other. They have already had six children, and she recently became pregnant again, for her seventh childbirth. On June 29 of this year, when her pregnancy reached full term, she felt pain in her abdomen in the morning and was about to give birth. Li immediately sent her to Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Obstetrics Hospital at No. 1 Route de Saulnier behind Shangxian Lane to await delivery. At 10:00 AM that morning, she gave birth to a son, delivered by Dr. Ge Chenghui. Mother and child were safe at the time of delivery. Unexpectedly, three days later, the parturient suddenly became ill, with a fever rising to over 100 degrees. Because there was no proper treatment in the hospital, Li took her home and sought medical treatment on his own.</p>
<p>Treatment Ineffective</p>
<p>She died on July 12. Li Shilin believed that his wife's illness and death were due to the hospital's disregard for patients, negligence of duty, and failure to provide medical treatment. He was heartbroken and hired Yan Yinwu and Lu Congzu as lawyers to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, based on Article 291 of the Criminal Law, suing Zhang Xiangwen, director of Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital, Dr. Ge Chenghui, head nurse Gu Qin, and others for negligence of duty resulting in death, requesting that they be summoned and punished according to law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court specially opened the second criminal court yesterday morning, presided over by Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, to summon both parties for trial. The plaintiff and lawyers Yan and Lu arrived at the court, and the defendants and their defense lawyer Tan Yigong also arrived. The audience in the gallery</p>
<p>Mostly Women</p>
<p>Especially those from the medical community. After the court opened, the judge first asked both parties about their age, origin, occupation, and address. Then, the plaintiff, Li Shilin, stated the facts of the complaint: My wife, Wang, was pregnant at full term and felt abdominal pain on the morning of June 29 of this year. I immediately accompanied her to Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Obstetrics Hospital, staying in a first-class room to await delivery. She was delivered by Dr. Ge Chenghui, and at 10:05 AM that morning, she gave birth to a boy. The parturient had previously given birth safely six times, and I always wanted to hire a midwife to deliver her. This time, she was sent to the hospital for delivery, especially because the time was ripe, without any obstacles or symptoms of illness. She was also very safe after delivery. On June 30, for some reason, the hospital director, Zhang Xiangwen, asked a Dr. Huang to conduct an examination on her behalf. On July 1, the parturient suddenly developed a fever. Logically, the doctor should</p>
<p>Fever in the Body</p>
<p>Carefully and meticulously examine the cause of the fever and treat it properly. However, the defendants did not pay attention and only said that it was milk engorgement, and that she only needed to drink less boiled water and eat less porridge to reduce the fever, without providing appropriate treatment. As a result, the fever rose even higher the next day. At that time, the parturient was very afraid of the cold and felt uneasy. She asked the doctor to see the fever chart herself, but the hospital refused to let her see it, only saying that she had a slight fever and that there was no problem, as long as she rested quietly for three days. In the afternoon, I went to visit and brought my own thermometer. I suddenly saw that the parturient's fever had risen to 104.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The room smelled terrible. I was shocked and looked around the room, but there was no one to take care of her. I hurriedly pressed the electric bell and asked a nurse to come and ask a doctor to come for examination. However, after waiting for a long time, no one entered the room. I went to the nurse's room on the second floor of the hospital, but the head nurse and nurses</p>
<p>No One Inside</p>
<p>This shows the hospital's neglect of patients, beyond compare. On the afternoon of July 4, I asked Dr. Chen Jingxu to go for a consultation. As soon as he entered the ward, he smelled a strange odor. Dr. Chen said that it was probably puerperal fever. Upon closer inspection, the parturient's body was covered with red and white spots, and the fever was as high as 104.8 degrees. It was indeed puerperal fever, caused by incomplete surgery during childbirth and careless disinfection and postpartum care. I knew the illness was critical and that it was useless to stay in the hospital, so I decided to move her back home and seek medical treatment elsewhere. However, the hospital forced her to sign a pre-printed voluntary discharge form, which was extremely hateful. After the parturient was carried home, Drs. Chen and Diao Xinde both diagnosed that it was</p>
<p>Puerperal Fever</p>
<p>And gave her injections for treatment, but it was difficult to save her. At 2:30 AM on the night of July 12, she died. Before her death, the parturient loudly complained that her life was completely lost at the hands of the hospital. Therefore, I hate the hospital's negligence and harm to human life, and I request the court to strictly investigate and punish the defendants for their due crimes. The official interrogated the defendant Zhang Xiangwen, who stated that the plaintiff's wife, Li Wang, came to the hospital for delivery, delivered by Dr. Ge. After delivery, Dr. Ge resigned on July 1 and left. After she left, I hired Drs. Hu Yizhu, Kuang Cuie, and Wang Baozhen to take turns to treat her. From July 1, Li Wang was seen by Dr. Hu and others. On July 1, Li Wang suddenly developed a fever of 101 degrees, which subsided. On the 2nd, it rose to over 101 degrees again. At that time, everyone</p>
<p>Thought it Was Milk Engorgement</p>
<p>And gave her milk-reducing medicine. On the afternoon of July 3, Dr. Hu examined Li Wang's white blood cells and found them to be over 8,000, which did not seem to indicate puerperal fever. On the afternoon of July 4, the plaintiff requested to take her back, and we did not stop him. Ge Chenghui stated that I only delivered the baby and resigned after delivery. Before I left, Li Wang showed no signs of illness. Gu Qin stated that I am the head nurse and am not in charge of what medicine the patient takes. The daily diagnosis was made by Dr. Hu and others. The court also summoned witnesses Tan Suzhen and others for questioning. The official stated that the case still requires summoning witness Dr. Chen Jingxu and others, and ordered them to adjourn the court and wait for a scheduled summons for further questioning, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Guangdong Woman Accuses Danish Husband of Abandonment</p>
<h3>Weeps in Court</h3>
<p>Clothes Ragged, Shape Miserable</p>
<p>Occasional Allegations Often Incomprehensible</p>
<p>Wei Youfu, a 24-year-old Guangdong woman residing at No. 3, Dengtu Lane, Dengtu Road, Hongkou, has been cohabiting with Danish national Disimei, practically as husband and wife. Recently, she was abandoned by the Danish national, resulting in financial difficulties. She had no choice but to file a criminal complaint against Disimei with the First Special Court, requesting that the case be investigated and punished. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Xiao opened the court for trial. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Ms. Wei, arrived at the second courtroom at 1:30 PM and waited. The woman's clothes were ragged, her face was wretched, and sores and boils grew on her neck. Her appearance was extremely miserable. When asked why she was involved in the lawsuit, she suddenly sobbed and cried until the judge took the stand, but she still did not stop her cries. The court then summoned the woman to the case and asked about her surname, age, origin, and address. Then, he told her, "Your complaint states that the defendant is a Danish national. Denmark enjoys consular jurisdiction in China. If you want to sue, you should file a lawsuit with the Danish consulate." However, the woman only knew how to cry, and the court order seemed unheard. Occasional allegations were often incomprehensible, and she claimed that she had filed a complaint with the Danish consulate, but the consulate denied that the defendant was of Danish nationality. Judge Xiao then ordered her to adjourn and wait for further summons.</p>
<p>Huangjia Road, Nanhui</p>
<h3>Hooligan Trouble Case Tried in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Murderer Zhu Gengshan's Followers are Numerous, So the Trial is Transferred to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Debate Has Ended Yesterday and Sentencing is Scheduled for the 14th of This Month</p>
<p>In Huangjia Road Town, Nanhui County, on June 7 of this year, Tang Yinlou teased a female worker at a sock factory. Yang Qiusheng saw this and rebuked him. Tang sued Zhu Gengshan (also known as Zhu Xiaomao, an unemployed Shandong native), Chen Yirong (currently a police officer, Anhui native), Hu Yaohai (a worker, Hebei native), Zhang Zhenjiang (a coppersmith, Nanhui native), Wang Shoushan (an unemployed Shandong native), Zhang Zhongyi (a lantern maker, Ningbo native), and others, gathered many people, and went to the town to seek revenge and riot. The whole town was shocked. Jiang Jinsong, a clerk at the First District Office of the county, went to investigate. Zhu Gengshan, Hu Yaohai, and others believed that he was obstructing them, so they stabbed Jiang Jinsong and Zhu Azhang and Ni Alou who were beside him with knives. Zhu Gengshan even dared to hold a box cannon in his hand and show it to the crowd. Fortunately, he was seized by merchant Zhu Guoxiang. At the same time, Zhu Gengshan was also beaten by Jiang Jinsong, Yang Yunchu, Yang Miaosheng, Yang Gensheng, Yang Qiusheng, Jiang Yezi, Zhu Azhang, and others. At that time, the situation was quite violent. All the shops in the town, seeing the large number of people and holding military weapons and bayonets, suspected that they were huge bandits looting, so they closed their doors and went on strike. County Magistrate Yuan of Nanhui not only detained Zhu Gengshan and others, but also found that Zhu Gengshan's followers who carried weapons to commit crimes were extremely numerous, and there were also many police officers in active service under his command. The government, in hearing this case, was deeply afraid that other accidents would occur and endanger public security. Therefore, it applied to the Jiangsu Higher Court to transfer jurisdiction. The Higher Court designated the Shanghai Local Court to handle the case. On one hand, the Nanhui County Government escorted Zhu Gengshan, Chen Yirong, Hu Yaohai, Zhang Zhenjiang, Wang Shoushan, Zhang Zhongyi, and others in custody to the Local Court for detention pending instructions. On the other hand, Jiang Jinsong, Yang Yunchu, Yang Miaosheng, Yang Gensheng, Yang Qiusheng, Jiang Yezi, and Zhu Azhang, who were released on bail, were ordered to surrender themselves to the court for interrogation. Now it is known that Prosecutor Xiao Jinrong has completed the investigation of the defendants for obstructing official duties, gathering crowds to fight, and illegally possessing firearms, and has filed a public prosecution. Zhu Gengshan was accused of holding a gun to gather a crowd, and Hu Yaohai was accused of beating Jiang Jinsong. Zhu Gengshan was also accused of injuring Zhu Azhang and Ni Alou. The First District Office clerk Jiang Jinsong went to investigate Zhu Gengshan, Chen Yirong, Hu Yaohai, Zhang Zhenjiang, Wang Shoushan, and Zhang Zhongyi, and implemented violent coercion. Jiang Jinsong, Yang Yunchu, Yang Miaosheng, Yang Gensheng, Jiang Yezi, Yang Qiusheng, and Zhu Azhang were also accused of jointly injuring Zhu Gengshan. All of these facts were clear. Zhu Gengshan, Chen Yirong, Hu Yaohai, Zhang Zhenjiang, Wang Shoushan, and Zhang Zhongyi were jointly accused of violating Article 142, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Zhu Gengshan and Hu Yaohai were also accused of violating Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Zhu Gengshan was also accused of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Military Firearms Control Regulations for possessing military firearms for criminal purposes. Jiang Jinsong, Yang Yunchu, Yang Miaosheng, Yang Gensheng, Jiang Yezi, Yang Qiusheng, and Zhu Azhang were also accused of jointly injuring Zhu Gengshan, violating Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Jikang specially opened the Third Court for trial. The seven defendants, Jiang Jinsong, Yang Yunchu, and others, who were released on bail, jointly hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to appear in court to defend them. After the judge took the stand, he ordered the six defendants in custody, Zhu Gengshan, Chen Yirong, Hu Yaohai, Zhang Zhenjiang, Wang Shoushan, and Zhang Zhongyi, and the seven defendants, Jiang Jinsong, etc., to be brought to the case for interrogation one by one. Their confessions denied the assault. The judge then asked Prosecutor Xiao to come to court to present his views. Finally, lawyer Pan Zhensheng stood up to defend them for a long time. The judge deemed the debate to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 14th of this month. The six defendants, Zhu Gengshan and others, were returned to custody. The seven defendants, Jiang Jinsong and others, were released on their original bail. Then, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Public Works Bureau Discussion</p>
<h3>Public Transportation Problems</h3>
<p>Consider Tram Cooperation with Buses</p>
<p>Extend Existing Routes and Improve Equipment</p>
<p>丨First Consult with Neighboring Municipal Authorities丨</p>
<p>A memorandum regarding public transportation in the International Settlement, submitted by the Commissioner of Public Works of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was presented for discussion at the last meeting of the Public Utilities Committee. The minutes of the meeting have been approved by the Board of Directors. The scope of the Commissioner of Public Works' memorandum is quite broad, and some points seem more appropriately considered traffic issues. These should be reviewed by the Traffic Committee. Therefore, the Public Utilities Committee's discussion is limited to public transportation issues concerning the tram and bus companies.</p>
<p>Improving Tram Problems Regarding the improvement of trams, the Commissioner of Public Works believes that since the Shanghai Municipal Council has not indicated whether it intends to acquire the tram business in 1940, the tram company may be unwilling to undertake large capital expenditures at this time. The tram franchise agreement is perpetual, but at the end of the 35th year (i.e., 1940) or every seven years thereafter, the Shanghai Municipal Council may, with six months' prior notice, acquire the developed business. The purchase price will be the fair market value as determined by arbitration, but no compensation will be given in addition to the purchase price due to compulsory acquisition or the company's established business reputation. The Commissioner of Public Works believes that how to improve the trams should be decided first. The rail system has been abandoned by many cities, but in the case of Shanghai, it would be difficult to abolish the trams and replace them with more satisfactory alternatives.</p>
<p>Construction of Elevated Railways The idea of constructing elevated railways has been proposed from time to time. The Commissioner of Public Works has studied this proposal in detail and concluded that it would be difficult to implement this public transportation method solely within the International Settlement. Furthermore, the current elevated railways have a drawback: most passengers must disembark at a limited number of locations, further congesting traffic.</p>
<p>Abolishing Trams The Commissioner of Public Works' memorandum proposes abolishing trams and replacing them with double-decker trolleybuses, stating that adding trolleybus routes and connecting them with existing trolleybus routes is easier than connecting them with tram routes. A committee member asked where trolleybuses are slower than double-decker buses. The Commissioner replied that the cost of operating trolleybuses is cheaper than operating petroleum-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>Detailed Discussion Results (1) All committee members agreed that the tram company and the bus company should cooperate with each other instead of competing, and believed that this matter should be handled through consultations between the authorities of the three districts. (2) During the discussion, it was suggested that the Shanghai Municipal Council should find ways to cooperate with the French Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Government to agree on a common approach to necessary improvements in public transport services. Currently, there is a great lack of transportation links between the three districts, but the Commissioner of Public Works believes that if the municipal authorities of the three districts can openly discuss their difficulties, they may be able to develop a valuable strategy. The north-south transportation routes traversing the International Settlement are now almost entirely within the central district, and urgently need to be extended to the western district. The lack of connection and cooperation between the current tram and trolleybus routes is also a drawback. If the tram tracks on the Bund are moved closer to the river, the Garden Bridge could be rebuilt and widened to 80 feet. The Commissioner does not agree with converting the current trams into double-decker ones because all the tracks are too narrow. Trolleybuses, because they can stop on the side of the road, are convenient for traffic. However, because of rickshaws, they cannot run close to the side of the road. Trolleybuses that run on overhead wires have a drawback: their movement is restricted by the wires, so they cannot overtake each other when running, as buses can. (3) All committee members agreed that the Shanghai Municipal Council should make preliminary consultations with the municipal authorities of the Chinese and French Concessions regarding improving public transport convenience, and should also inquire with the tram company about its preparations for improving equipment. (4) All committee members also believed that extending existing routes is as important as improving equipment, but the issue of extending routes can only be considered based on the outcome of consultations with the municipal authorities of the two neighboring concessions.</p>
<p>Lujiazui Wharf Workers</p>
<h3>Fighting Over Cargo Handling</h3>
<p>Qiu Shuibao Seriously Injured, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Police Arrested the Culprit and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Wan Yingquan, nicknamed "Wan the Second Blind" (age 31, from Yancheng), a notorious rogue residing at No. 216, Tobacco Factory Road, Pudong, Guo Renzhi, also known as Guo Si (age 33, from Gaoyou), residing at No. 29, Yangjiazhai, and Li Yunxiang (age 34, from Siyang), and others, fought with Qiu Shuibao (age 25, from Liyang), Lu Yuangen (age 34), Pan Xicai (age 31), and Wu Youcai (age 40), all from No. 28, Wufu Lane, Tobacco Factory Road, over the business of carrying goods at the Lujiazui Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory wharf (currently under construction) by the Xinmingji Construction Company. The fight occurred yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, with over a hundred people on each side using axes, iron bars, and other weapons. The order was disrupted and resembled a major enemy assault. As a result, the Liyang gang was defeated, and Qiu Shuibao was most severely injured by Wan Yingquan and others, while Pan, Wu, and others sustained lesser injuries. The request police from the Xinmingji Construction Company reported the incident to the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The district chief Zhang Mingqin dispatched a large number of police officers, along with several policemen from the Third Squad stationed in Pudong, to the address. When the workers saw the police arrive, they fled in fear of punishment. Only the culprits Wan Yingquan, Guo Renzhi, Wang Yuzhen, Li Yunxiang, and others were arrested, and the injured Qiu Xiaobao and others were taken to the district. Because the case involved injury, except for Qiu Shuibao who was sent to the hospital for treatment, the others were sent to the local court to be dealt with according to the law. According to the hospital diagnosis, Qiu Shuibao's injuries are very serious and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Red Pill Den Cracked Down</h3>
<p>Chief Culprit Arrested at Dadong Hotel</p>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Two Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the Criminal Investigation Division of the Central Police Station, and detectives Chen Yonggui and Xu Guirong, learned that Wang Guitong (also known as Peng Guitong), from Hunan, specialized in selling opium substitutes, white pills (also known as "quick highs"). They instructed someone to purchase a package and then requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, they rushed to Room 227 of the Dadong Hotel at No. 30 Yinghua Street, arrested Wang, and confiscated nine packs of white pills. According to Wang's confession, the manufacturing facility was located at No. 234 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. The detectives, together with detectives from the French Police Station, went to the address and seized a large amount of raw materials for manufacturing white pills, such as coffee, salted starch, Taikoo sugar, and a machine and a sieve, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian presented the case and prosecuted according to Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law, requesting severe punishment according to the law. Wang Guitong confessed to manufacturing and selling white pills without denial. After reviewing the confession, Judge Feng Shide sentenced Wang to one year and two months imprisonment and imposed a fine of 100 yuan as a warning. The seized white pills were confiscated.</p>
<p>Fourteen-Year-Old Girl</p>
<h3>Stealing in the Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>Watches and Other Items Seized at Her Home</p>
<p>Yesterday Sentenced to a Fine of Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Yu Meili, the wife of Pan, a clerk of the Second Special Court of Jiangsu Shanghai, lived at No. 7 Chunshou Lane, Xinzha Road. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month around 4:00 PM, Yu and her girlfriend went swimming at the Hongkou Swimming Pool on Jiangwan Road. They arrived at the destination and occupied rooms No. 8 and 9. They put the items they brought in the room, changed their clothes, and entered the water. When they finished swimming and checked the items they brought, a rectangular platinum-encrusted watch, five yuan in paper money, and a small wallet containing one yuan and eight jiao in silver were missing from Ms. Yu's handbag. Fortunately, her friend did not lose anything. At that time, Ms. Yu did not report the theft to the police because the loss was small. She only reported the theft to Chinese police officer No. 1318 at the pool and returned home. Around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the police officer was patrolling the Hongkou Swimming Pool when he saw a young woman acting suspiciously. He detained her and, after questioning, she admitted to stealing. He took her to the Des Voeux Road Police Station. The Chinese and foreign detectives learned that the girl's name was Wu Suying, from Jiangsu, only 14 years old, and lived at No. 664 Haining Road. She was studying at the nearby Cui Dao Girls' School. The detectives went to her home to search and seized two watches and five yuan in paper money and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhuang Baolian presented the case, stating that the police had found two watches at her residence yesterday. One had been identified by the owner, Ms. Yu, and the other had not yet been identified. Ms. Yu also filed a complaint about the theft, saying that the watch and five yuan in paper money were definitely hers, and a small wallet containing one yuan and eight jiao in silver had not been found. As for the other watch, she did not know who had been stolen from. The defendant, Wu Suying, admitted to the theft, but claimed that the two watches were stolen from the same box. Her mother, Wu Zhangshi, stated that she did not know anything about what her daughter had done and begged for mercy. Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the confession and sentenced Wu Suying to a fine of twenty yuan. One watch and five yuan in paper money were returned to the owner, and the other watch was kept for the owner to claim.</p>
<p>School Principal</p>
<h3>Joint Theft and Trafficking of Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>Stealing Needles from Singer Company</p>
<p>Principal on the Run Arrested at Store</p>
<p>Chen Ruxin, a 20-year-old from Baoshan, the principal of the Wanguo Commercial School at No. 15 Yuxiang Lane, Qianjiatang, Avenue Joffre, was friends with Feng Xiqing, a Tianjin native who worked at the Singer Company's store. They colluded with each other, with Feng continuously stealing sewing machine needles from the company and handing them over to Chen for private sale, sharing the profits. The company was initially unaware. Recently, an employee of the company saw sewing machine needles being sold in a store on his way home from watching a movie at the Cathay Theatre. The style and trademark were exactly the same as those sold by Singer. The employee then entered the store to inquire about the price, and was told that each dozen sold for one yuan and two fen. The employee knew that only Singer sold this type of needle and that each dozen cost one yuan and five jiao. He suspected that the store was selling counterfeit goods or that the source was questionable. He reported this to the company that day, and while the company was conducting a secret investigation, Feng Xiqing suddenly left without saying goodbye. The company suspected that Feng was involved and reported it to the Central Police Station. Detective Jiang Shangpei searched Feng's room and found letters between Feng and Chen Ruxin, as well as a photo of Chen and a contract they signed for Chen to sell the stolen goods and share the profits. It was also determined that more than 1,500 dozen of these sewing machine needles had been stolen since January of this year. The day before yesterday, Detective Jiang rushed to the Wanguo Commercial School to investigate Chen. Chen tried to deny it, claiming that his surname was Wang and that he was not Chen. Detective Jiang showed him the photo, saying that his true identity could not be concealed. Chen then admitted everything and was arrested. It is unknown where Feng has fled. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution on charges of joint theft. After Judge Zhan Liangce questioned him, he ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing for seven days. The defendant Chen Ruxin was taken back to the police station for detention. For a school principal to commit joint theft and be responsible for selling stolen goods is truly a case of greed blinding his judgment.</p>
<p>Electrical Engineering Expert</p>
<h3>Zhang Yougu Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhang Yougu, who graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University, went to study in the United States at his own expense in 1927 and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, specializing in electrical engineering. He obtained a bachelor's degree in 1929 and then interned at the General Electric Manufacturing Plant. The following year, he transferred to the Harvard University Graduate School to study radio science and obtained a doctorate. He returned to China yesterday on the Dollar Company's President Grant. Those who came to greet him at the port included his younger brother Lian Gu, his older sisters Qi Gu and Ying Gu, and relatives and friends. After seven years apart, they were finally reunited, and their emotions were extremely harmonious. It is believed that after Dr. Zhang returns to China, he will make a significant contribution to electrical engineering.</p>
<h3>Many Insane People in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Insanity is one of the diseases of civilization. The more advanced and complex society becomes, the more frequently this disease is found. It is also related to the climate. Since the beginning of summer in Shanghai, various police stations have repeatedly detained insane people on the streets and sent them to the Shanghai Mental Hospital affiliated with the China Mental Hospital next to the Dong Youheng Road vegetable market in Hongkou for treatment. It is said that the hospital is large-scale and the treatment is rapid. It is estimated that those admitted to the hospital for treatment this week include Zhao Zhennan from Shaoxing, Ni Tingxiang from the Qiashengchang store on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, and Chen Lu from the Sanyixin Silk Weaving Factory on Zhoujiazui Road. In addition, there are also an unknown female madwoman detained by the Hongkou police station, Yang Aquan, Yu Ren detained by the Jing'an Temple police station, an unknown madwoman detained by the Jiaxing Road police station, and Wu Yuankang detained by the Laozha police station, totaling 17 people. Among them, Yang Aquan, sent by the Hongkou police station, and Yu Ren, sent by the Jing'an Temple police station, are said to have been cured and discharged from the hospital after only five or six days of treatment.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read a news report on the fourth page of today's newspaper entitled "Disabled Anti-Japanese Soldiers Request Relief." The report stated that Yao Ziyu and others were originally from the Northeast and followed Mr. Ma in fighting the Japanese. They were injured and disabled and came to Shanghai to visit Mr. Ma, but he happened to be in Lushan for summer vacation. Recently, they repeatedly visited me, but I refused to see them. I am shocked to read this. Although I am in Shanghai, I am fulfilling my responsibility to speak out for my fellow Northeasterners. It is driven by my personal conscience and I am not responsible for anyone, nor have I been entrusted by Mr. Ma to be in charge of affairs in Shanghai. As for Yao and the other seven people, they have never met me, so it is incomprehensible to say that they visited me and were refused. However, I would like to state that even if the seven people met me, it would only be to no avail. We are fellow sufferers. Because we are all people from the lost province, displaced and unable to take care of ourselves. I am deeply afraid that the rumors are untrue. I hope that your newspaper will correct them in the letter column. Sincerely, Wu Huanzhang, August 8.</p>

<h3>The Misty Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Behind this throne, as usual, there was inevitably a screen. Its material was also rosewood, lacquered very brightly, and inlaid with invaluable jade and gemstones. However, no one could say what its real use was. It was only known that it was always connected to the throne. Wherever there was a throne, there must be a screen behind it; wherever there was a screen, there must be a throne in front of it. These two things had simply become an inseparable set of furniture. It is said that this custom has been followed for generations, not only in the Qing Palace. Unfortunately, no one can say how this special custom was created in the first place!</p>
<p>I just said that the screen behind the throne, no one knows what its real use is, but on the train, it shows part of its effect. The Empress Dowager usually takes a nap often, so we specially prepared a small soft couch for her, placed behind this screen, so that she can rest at any time during the day, and there is no need to return to that small bedroom specifically.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that when our journey had just begun, at the Yongdingmen Station, the Empress Dowager, supported by me and a few others, stepped onto this novel means of transportation for the first time, she initially seemed a bit embarrassed; because although the layout of this carriage and bedroom had undergone the design and efforts of many people, it was more mysterious than all the great halls and bedrooms in the palace, and it could be praised as "ingenious and unique," but their area was ultimately limited by the position of the train. No matter which great engineer was consulted, it was probably impossible to expand it. And the Empress Dowager was accustomed to spacious and grand places in the past. Once suddenly placed in such a narrow room, she would naturally feel a bit different in spirit. However, after five or six minutes, she gradually got used to it. The first thing she said was to order those eunuchs to check clearly whether the direction of her throne was indeed the same as the direction of the train's advancement, because she felt that if she turned her back and let the train drag her, always going backwards, it would be very detrimental to her dignity.

<h3>Summer Nights</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>In the poet's pen, the loveliness of summer nights is often written, especially with a hint of sexual atmosphere. It is true that we can easily find this kind of material when we go to the city. Not to mention the dance halls and bathhouses in Shanghai, and all the places with romantic sentiments, Suzhou's parks alone are enough to write a magnificent masterpiece.</p>
<p>But, how do other summer nights pass? Apart from sleeping in the streets, there is only the option of squeezing into pigeon cages that are like fire pits. Fortunately, there are particularly few mosquitoes and insects this year, probably because of the long drought, their reproductive capacity has also decreased. Indeed, the situation is very serious. We haven't heard people singing folk songs on the streets to attract people to enjoy the cool air for a long time. This can prove that they have no interest in appreciating and praising this summer night anymore. What we often hear is the sound of various different buckets hitting the stone well railing at the public well outside the door, almost rhythmically. We can't help but look up at the sky, resenting those twinkling stars, always staring wide-eyed, is it possible that this year's summer night will always be so dry that even dew cannot form?</p>
<p>Summer nights in the city are, in any case, a little better than in the countryside. A few days ago, it wasn't as dry or as hot as it is now, but when I passed through the countryside, looking from the boat to the shore, the young crops looked withered and about to die. Dogs stick out their two or three-inch-long red tongues. Children immerse themselves in the shallow water of the shore. Although the setting sun had already gone down, and the twilight had gradually deepened, everything was still in distress, without any sign of recovery. It can be said that predicting their fate this year, I can't help but feel cold for them; even if we think about ourselves, we won't have time to grieve for ourselves.</p>
<h3>The "Chinese Daily News" is Shenbao's Elder Brother</h3>
<p>— Jing Feifeng</p>
<p>I read Mr. Yan Qiao's article "Shenbao's Elder Brother" before, which said that there is also a "Circulation Daily News" in Hong Kong, which held its 70th anniversary last year... Then it is nine years older than Shenbao, and should be called the eldest brother.... However, the author happened to borrow a copy of Chinese Journalism published by Modern Book Company (written by Huang Tianpeng, published by Hong Kong Dianfan) from the circulation library attached to the Shenbao office yesterday, which included an appendix "Chronicle of Major Events in the News Industry in the Last Hundred Years," which stated "In 1872 AD (i.e., the 11th year of Tongzhi), Shenbao was published in Shanghai, initially run by the British man Meizha, and later taken over by Mr. Xi. After the Republic of China, it belonged to Mr. Shi Liangcai, and with its long history, it led the country." "In 1873 AD (i.e., the 12th year of Tongzhi), Zhaowen Xinbao was founded in Hankou, advocated by Ai Xiaomei, as the first newspaper run by the Chinese themselves," "In 1874 AD (i.e., the 13th year of Tongzhi), Circulation Daily News was published, by Wang Tao and Wang Gan, and still exists independently in Hong Kong." From this point of view, although the "Circulation Daily News" in Hong Kong has a long history since its publication, it was not published as early as Shenbao (less than three years difference), then Shenbao is still the "Circulation Daily News"'s elder brother. According to another record, "In 1864 AD (i.e., the 3rd year of Tongzhi), Chinese Daily News was published, hosted by Chen Aiting, initially a Chinese newspaper of the German Chenbao, with only a quarter of the current size, and mainly translated Western newspapers and reprinted the Beijing Gazette, and still exists in Hong Kong, as one of the oldest Chinese newspapers." According to this, Shenbao's elder brother is actually the "Chinese Daily News," because the "Chinese Daily News" was published nine years earlier than Shenbao.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-Two: The General Amuses Himself with Sensual Pleasures All Day Long; Several Crying Soldiers Return</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, the old lady came out, not walking on her own, but being supported by a servant. The old lady's face was full of tears, trembling, with her mouth open and unable to close it. The servant kept telling her not to cry, and helped her out all the way. Another servant led Mrs. Guan in. Seeing this scene, Guizhi was already flustered, not knowing what to do, just sitting there blankly. After another ten minutes or so, Mrs. Guan came stumbling out with a child in her arms, followed by two children. She couldn't follow the rules like the old lady, and had already cried out loud. She counted her grievances: "Oh my god, leaving these three children to me, what am I going to do?" Guizhi rushed forward, blocking her and asking: "Sister-in-law, what... what's wrong?" Mrs. Guan said with tears: "Company Commander Yin said that he didn't die when he jumped down the city, he slept in a hole for a day, and crawled out in the dark before being rescued. Only a dozen brothers from the whole battalion came back, he saw with his own eyes... what am I going to do?" Several servants crowded forward, not allowing her to cry anymore, quickly pushing and persuading her out. At this time, Guizhi was really flustered. Thinking that if she went in and asked Company Commander Yin, there was no doubt that she would also cry. If she didn't go in and ask him, she wouldn't know what was going on with her husband. Struggling like this, she started crying first. At this moment, there was a servant who was about to lead him in to see the patient, but seeing that he hadn't gone in and was crying first, he stood there in a daze for a long time before asking: "Aren't you going in to see him?" Guizhi wiped her eyes and said: "I'm afraid that if I go in, he'll tell me bad news." The servant didn't understand what she meant, and couldn't wait any longer, so he turned around and left on his own. Guizhi wanted to follow him in, but it was too late, she had no idea, and had to go to the reception room. She saw the old lady Tian, Mrs. Guan, and those children crying together outside the door. She didn't go forward, and didn't know where the grief came from, so she just watched from afar and started crying too. The receptionist, who was about fifty years old, was a kind-hearted person, and greeted Guizhi: "Madam, have you seen the news about your company commander?" Guizhi said: "No, I saw one going in and one coming out crying, and I didn't dare to ask Company Commander Yin." The receptionist said: "Nonsense! Why didn't you go in? How can you find out if you don't go in? Come with me." So he led Guizhi forward again. (452)</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Gem Among Men (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn issue of July 23rd of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] contained a telegram from Mr. Wang Shouqiu about a "human gem." The object described therein was most likely a child's toy swallowed by a turtle, certainly not naturally formed, because the "ma bao" (horse gem) type of object is always a mineral concretion. In the third year of the Republic [1914], I personally witnessed one dissected from the belly of a horse in Huai'an. It was as large as a goose egg, wrapped in a thin membrane, with many bluish-purple, red, and yellow veins visible inside. It was as hard as stone, weighing about two liang (approximately 74 grams), and was priced at 800 yuan. It was ultimately purchased by a druggist. I obtained one qian (approximately 3.7 grams) for 20 yuan, and when tested with tri-acid, it did not react, possessing the same properties as talc. Generally, this is due to the ingestion of substances containing magnesium salts and silicic acid, similar to how gravel accumulates in the bladder, but in this case, it accumulates in the stomach. Cancer of the stomach in humans is exactly analogous to this. Volume 52 of the Compendium of Materia Medica, in the section on humans, contains an entry on "bi shi" (stone concretion), detailing its composition in great detail. Descriptions of human-shaped objects refer to the mottled patterns on the cross-section, similar to the veining of marble, able to form landscapes and figures, not an entire form. Mr. Wang likely did not witness it firsthand, and thus propagated an error. These concretions have their own names, such as "niu huang zha da" (ox gall residue), all of which are "ma bao" types of objects. In humans, it is called "bi shi," not "bao" (gem), because dogs and horses are inherently base creatures. Obtaining such an object gives them extraordinary value, and thus it is considered a "gem." If humans possess it, it leads to illness and death; what "gem" is that? In general, when people are particularly fond of something, it is called a "pi" (addiction). The deeper the "pi," the more one's spirit concentrates on it, and thus the heart's blood coagulates and transforms into a stone-like substance. Therefore, the corpses described by Li Shizhen all had "bi shi" in the heart chamber, which is different from those caused by diet. "Ma bao" is a magical medicine for treating madness, but it must be supplemented with phlegm-resolving ingredients to have a miraculous effect. Its significance lies in the mutual induction of similar things, thus it is used as a guiding agent. When horses suffer from madness, dissecting them will inevitably yield a "ma bao." In Huai'an, one or two can be obtained every year. Generally, Huai salt contains a large amount of magnesium. If a horse drinks water containing sodium silicate, it will combine to form magnesium silicate stone, leading to a feeling of obstruction, and thus madness. Traditional Chinese medicine uses drugs, all taking similar types as guiding agents, which is consistent with chemical principles. Using "ma bao" to treat human blockages is because human "pi shi" cannot be obtained. Living "ma bao" must be obtained from living animals. In the past, there was no dissection of living humans to obtain human "bi shi," thus it is not found in the world. The "bi shi" recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica only refers to those obtained from corpses, not from living creatures. Living "ma bao" must be obtained from living animals, and is called "living gem" by the world, extremely emphasizing its rarity. However, my family actually has what Mr. Wang idealizes as a "human gem," which is also sufficient for conversation. For details, see the preface to my work Half-Acre Garden, dedicated to the French doctor Xie Bi, which says, "My second daughter-in-law suffered from a severe 'river fish' disease (ectopic pregnancy). Various doctors gave different opinions, without any consensus. Each attack caused unbearable pain. In April of gengwu year [1930], an attack did not stop. Treatment continued for ten days, but worsened. Only when Dr. Xie Bi was consulted and diagnosed it as an ectopic pregnancy, which could only be cured by surgery. Initially, we dared not try, but when it became unavoidable, the abdomen was opened, and a huge object like a fist was extracted, half a foot long, nearly one foot in circumference, and weighing about two pounds. Its outer shape resembled a sac, and its inner part was hard, suspected to be bone. When it was cut into three pieces, it turned out to be completely stone, similar to 'ma bao.' Examining the Compendium of Materia Medica, it is called 'bi shi.' Since ancient times, no one has obtained it from the abdomen of a living person. It is said to be able to treat hernias, so we preserved it."</p>

<h3>The Enslavement Education in the Northeast is Gradually Taking Concrete Shape</h3>
<p>All Kinds of Measures Come from Japanese Instigation</p>
<p>To Eliminate Our National Character in Order to Achieve Assimilation</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Shenyang) The budget of the puppet "Ministry of Education" for this year, including the regular and temporary sections, totals 6,114,268 yuan, an increase of more than six times compared to the previous year's budget of 930,000 yuan (including supplementary budgets). The main undertakings planned by the puppet Ministry of Education in the new year's budget are listed below:</p>
<p>Higher Normal School: This school is the highest institution in the puppet organization and a training institution for secondary school teachers. The school site has been set up at the old site of Jilin University. The establishment cost is estimated at more than 300,000 yuan. A preparatory committee for the establishment of the school has now been set up within the puppet Ministry of Education, and preparations are being made step by step. It is scheduled to open in mid-August. The initial number of students enrolled in the first year is 150. The principal and all staff of the school are currently being selected by the puppet Ministry of Education, and no final decision has been made.</p>
<p>Agricultural Vocational School: Following the highest institution, the Higher Normal School, four vocational schools of agriculture, industry, commerce and medicine will be established. Below these are the so-called primary and secondary schools. The school system at all levels will be completed. In the new year, the Agricultural Vocational School will be established first, and it is planned to open in "Fengtian" in January next year. The initial number of students enrolled is planned to be 100.</p>
<p>Enhance Teacher Training: Enhance the current puppet Capital Teacher Training Institute, extend the training period of the former three-month training institute to six months, and implement matters such as training personnel and moving school buildings. In addition, it is also necessary to expand the local teacher training conferences at various sites.</p>
<p>Increase Tuition Fees for Studying in Japan: Advocate enslavement education and encourage studying in Japan. Many teachers and students in the Northeast are induced to study in Japan. Therefore, the subsidy for tuition fees for studying abroad is gradually increased. On the one hand, in order to liaise with the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a new puppet Study Abroad Affairs Office is added to the puppet embassy in Japan to handle affairs between the puppet Ministry of Education and the puppet students studying abroad.</p>
<p>Preservation of Ancient Sites and Relics: Preservation of ancient sites and relics throughout the puppet state is a point of particular attention for the Japanese side. It is planned to repair the Summer Palace Lama Pagoda in Rehe Province first, and establish a treasure house to preserve ancient relics for public viewing.</p>
<p>Implementation of Social Education: Social education will be carried out in parallel with school education. In the new year, film education, moral education, public education, and the enhancement of local museums and libraries will be implemented. This is the first year of the so-called five-year plan for social education. In addition, new budget items include 106 provincial special primary and secondary schools and cultural institutions such as provincial museums and libraries, which were previously under the budget of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and have now been transferred to the puppet Ministry of Education. This expenditure amounts to more than 3.3 million yuan. In order to improve the quality of teachers in enslavement primary and secondary schools, a certification system must be established, which will be implemented starting this year. In addition, it is also planned to provide free textbooks for elementary schools and printed materials such as the Veritable Records of the Qing Dynasty. All these measures are instigated or ordered by the Japanese in order to form a situation of assimilation as soon as possible. At the same time, on the surface, it can also make the ignorant or short-sighted people sing praises and virtues, while eliminating our national character. The insidious cultural aggression of the violent Japanese is indeed beyond description.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education's Instruction for Vocational Schools and Above</p>
<h3>Key Points for Improvement in Various Schools (8)</h3>
<p>Hunan Provincial University</p>
<p>The school's environment is suitable for academic research. The departments and faculties established meet local needs. Most of the faculty and staff are able to diligently perform their duties. Students are diligent in their studies and abide by the rules. Enrollment is also relatively strict. However, the engineering building and exhibition hall of the Faculty of Engineering should be urgently constructed to establish a permanent foundation for the faculty and to inspire people's knowledge of science and practical technology. The equipment of each department is still too simple. Equipment fees should be increased in the future, focusing on enriching the content and then seeking the expansion of departments and faculties. The treatment of teachers should also be appropriately increased so as to attract experts from all parties.</p>
<h3>Private Franco-Chinese University</h3>
<p>The school has made considerable progress in recent years. However, there are still many areas that need to be improved. The key points are presented below:</p>
<p>(1) The name of the school's Faculty of Social Sciences is inconsistent with the University Organization Law. The Department of Philosophy and Department of Social Sciences established therein have many overlapping courses with the Department of Chinese Studies, Department of French Literature, and Department of Economics of the Faculty of Arts. The teachers also hold concurrent positions. The personnel in charge of the faculty cannot be in the faculty on a daily basis, and the faculty is far away from other faculties, making management difficult. In terms of economy, administration, and teaching, it is inconvenient. The faculty should be abolished immediately, and the original departments should be incorporated into the Faculty of Arts for management, or the students should be incorporated into the departments of the Faculty of Arts. The senior high school classes of the three divisions of the faculties and the Comte School can be moved into the remaining school buildings of the faculty and managed centrally.</p>
<p>(2) The names of the school's Fold College, Curie College, Lumo Ke College, and Comte College, used to replace the four faculties of Arts, Science, Medicine, and Social Sciences, are inconsistent with the regulations. Except for Comte College, which should be abolished immediately, Fold, Curie, and Lumo Ke Colleges should be renamed as Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Science, and Faculty of Medicine, respectively. The names that have been used for a long time originally have the meaning of commemorating famous scientists, and can be reserved for use as the names of the buildings of each faculty, such as Fold College and Curie College.</p>
<p>(3) The school's funding is limited. If other undertakings gradually increase, the development of the university part will be affected. In the future, the university's funding should be determined so that it can develop independently.</p>
<p>(4) The school's faculty and staff should be increased as much as possible on a full-time basis, and the treatment should be appropriately increased. The equipment should also be strengthened, and special attention should be paid to student training.</p>
<h3>Private Wuchang Wenhua Library Science Vocational School</h3>
<p>The school is run conscientiously, and the talents it cultivates are quite able to adapt to the needs of society, which is commendable. However, the school's own equipment is too simple and should be strengthened. The place for students to practice is only the library of Central China University, which does not have many books, and Chinese books are particularly lacking. Books should be purchased urgently, or ways should be found to expand internship opportunities to facilitate training.</p>
<h3>Private Wuchang Art Vocational School</h3>
<p>The key points for improvement in the school are specially presented as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The vocational and secondary school parts of the school should be managed separately as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) The school's curriculum teaching should focus on practicality and application to meet the needs of society. The curriculum outline should be compiled and submitted to the Ministry for verification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) The annual operating expenses of the school are donated by the school board of directors, accounting for about 40% of the total annual income, which is not a long-term plan. It is urgent to raise funds to consolidate the foundation. The accounting records should be thoroughly reorganized.</p>
<p>(4) The equipment of the school's drawing and engineering department is simple and should be strengthened. A practical art factory should be actively prepared to be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(5) The treatment of the school's teachers should be improved. It is commendable that teachers can implement make-up classes for leave on weekdays, but leave should not occur frequently.</p>
<p>(6) Too many students are absent from class. Strict measures should be taken to stop this. The management and training methods on weekdays must be comprehensive. The level of new students is too low. In the future, enrollment should be strictly recorded.</p>
<h3>Private Zhongshan Physical Education College</h3>
<p>Special reminders of the key points for improvement required by the school are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Although the school's funds have slightly increased since the approval for establishment, efforts should still be made to raise more funds for development. Too little is allocated for expenses and teaching material; attempts should be made to supplement this according to the Ministry's set standards.</p>
<p>(2) The school's plan to rebuild all school buildings should be actively pursued to ensure its early realization. The existing school buildings, including the dining hall, kitchen, and toilets, are unhygienic and should be improved entirely.</p>
<p>(3) The school lacks teaching staff. More full-time instructors with superior academic knowledge and rich experience should be hired.</p>
<p>(4) The school has been overly lenient in admitting specialist students, resulting in a generally low level of student proficiency. There are very few students whose notes are detailed, well-organized, and clear. In the future, the school must strictly conduct entrance examinations. The students' coursework and the instructors' teaching should be rigorously assessed regularly. The number of specialist students admitted this year should not exceed thirty at most, as a means of restriction. Furthermore, academic credentials of new and old students and the annual grades of old students should be reported on time.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Order to All Schools</p>
<h3>Organizing Career Placement Agencies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Education issued an order to all departments, stating: The Ministry recently received a proposal from the Executive Yuan regarding the petition from graduates of various universities in Peiping requesting relief from unemployment and suggesting a fundamental solution. One of the suggestions was to issue a circular to all universities and social organizations nationwide to encourage them to establish career placement agencies to assist university graduates in finding employment. The issue of youth unemployment is extremely complex and cannot be resolved solely by a department or ministry. However, the request in the original petition for each school to establish a career placement agency is indeed one of the relief measures. Each school should investigate and handle it accordingly. In addition to the Ministry consulting with the National Economic Council to establish a National Academic Work Advisory Center and reporting back, this order is also being circulated for compliance.</p>
<p>Teaching and Staff Association of Peiping and Tianjin Colleges</p>
<h3>Sending Representatives to Nanjing to Demand Owed Funds</h3>
<p>(Peiping, 8th) The Teaching and Staff Association of Peiping and Tianjin Colleges has decided to send representatives Yang Likui, Zhang Yude, Mou Mo, and Zhou Jianhou to Nanjing to petition for owed funds.</p>

<h3>Overseas Students Must Pay Attention to Insurance Studies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Industry intends to inform the Shanghai insurance industry that, as China's insurance industry is still in its infancy, management and operations are severely lacking in talent. There are very few students studying this subject overseas. Therefore, the Ministry of Education is requested to notify various embassies to inform students being sent abroad to pay attention to insurance science.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Department of Education</p>

<p>Demands from Japanese Residents</p>
<h3>Increase Allowances for School Children</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's 1934 budget, the education expenses for Western children included six schools, enrolling 1,600 students, with an expenditure of 911,000 yuan and tuition revenue of 248,000 yuan. For Chinese public schools, there were six schools, enrolling 5,600 students, with an expenditure of 1,028,000 yuan and tuition revenue of 244,000 yuan. Since two years ago, the Japanese have received a considerable subsidy annually. However, the Japanese community believes that the treatment is still unfair. Taking advantage of the Shanghai Municipal Council's current preparation of the next year's budget, they intend to request an increase in the allowance for Japanese students from the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>

In addition to acquiring the former Health Experiment Institute near the city center as school buildings, it is also reported that several acres of private land have been purchased to build a lecture hall and dormitory in order to make it as perfect as possible. Because students in each department are already full this semester, the number of new students is only a few dozen. However, in recent days, those applying for admission to the school have been extremely enthusiastic, exceeding the quota by several times.</p>
<p>Private Huahai Vocational High School: The Private Huahai Vocational High School in this city, with reference to various past experiences of vocational guidance in Europe and the United States and the needs of domestic careers, has created a career guarantee system, opening an era of career protection. Principal Qiu Hanping believes that if vocational school graduates are still unemployed, it is tantamount to vocational schools becoming manufacturing sites for the unemployed, which weakens the faith of fathers and elder brothers in vocational schools and loses the purpose of vocational schools. Therefore, in addition to collecting career preparation funds each semester, the school also raises a career preparation fund to ensure the reliable career prospects of graduates three years later. This fund is separately managed by a custodial committee and properly deposited in the bank. In the future, the school plans to make good use of this fund to create various businesses to accommodate graduates to work and settle in.</p>
<p>Chizhi Affiliated High School: Chizhi College Affiliated High School, in view of the frequent disasters and rural bankruptcy in recent years, in order to reduce the burden on students, the school board decided to reduce the tuition fees for all senior high school and junior high school students by ten yuan per person from the autumn semester of this year.

His qualifications and reputation are well-known. He has now arrived at the college. Mrs. Wang Yihui, a newly hired associate professor of bacteriology, has also arrived at the college with her husband to take up her post.</p>
<p>Mingchen Elementary School, Xinqiaotou, Nanshi: Mingchen Elementary School is located in an industrial area, and 80 to 90 percent of the children are out of school. In order to popularize mass education, the school has set up a night school. The students are crowded and it is very developed. The principal wants to implement his original intention of serving the community, so he held the second variety show on the 5th of this month at 7:00 PM. There are many programs, and he pays more attention to the literacy movement, such as dramas about the suffering of illiteracy. Those who come to the school to get admission tickets are coming one after another.</p>
<p>Huiling Middle School: Huiling Middle School's junior high school department, since moving to the new address at 288 Maigen Road, has renovated the school buildings and started working. On July 31st, the first entrance examination for new male and female students was held. The number of people admitted will be announced soon. Because there are still vacancies in each grade, a second recruitment examination will be held on August 31st. Late applications will not be accepted. The affiliated elementary school department is also ready and has started enrollment. There are quite a few applicants. Furthermore, in view of the economic recession in recent years, in order to reduce the burden on the parents of each student, the tuition fee for senior high school students has been reduced from the original 40 yuan to 35 yuan, and the tuition fee for junior high school students has been reduced from the original 35 yuan to 25 yuan, so as to broaden the opportunities for education.</p>

<p>Handball Master Zheng Guiguang</p>
<h3>Second Performance Today</h3>
<p>Lost to Sun Daosheng Yesterday</p>
<p>Against Hong Yukui Today</p>
<p>Zheng Guiguang, a famous handball master from overseas Chinese in Honolulu, played his first performance match with Sun Daosheng, a veteran of the China YMCA, at the YMCA handball room at 4:00 PM yesterday. He will play his second performance match with Hong Yukui, a good player of the YMCA, at 5:00 PM today. Mr. Zheng is leaving Shanghai soon, and this may be one of his last battles.</p>
<p>The Process of the Battle: The long-quiet YMCA handball court suddenly attracted many spectators. After the two sides clashed, Zheng scored a few points first. Soon, Sun gradually advanced, and the situation became confrontational. After a score of ten to ten, Sun used his ingenious skills to rise sharply, arousing the infinite interest of the spectators. Sun won the first game 21 to 12. In the second game, Sun took advantage of his victory and took the lead. Zheng suddenly made a surprising move, sweeping away everything in his path and becoming invincible, and immediately reversed the score to 11 to 6. At this time, Sun's will was calm and his skills were agile. He used his strengths to overcome his opponent's weaknesses. After five or six rounds, Sun regained the advantage and won the final game. Sun also won 21 to 12. As a result, Sun won two to zero.</p>
<p>Overview of Ball Skills: Mr. Zheng is an all-around athlete from Honolulu, especially good at handball. His right hand kills have a thousand pounds of pressure. He can hit the north wall and counterattack as he pleases, and his rescues are as fast as lightning. He is truly worthy of his reputation. Mr. Sun is a veteran handball player of the YMCA. For more than ten years, he has used his left and right hands as if they were flying. He can see people's shortcomings and take advantage of them easily. His serves are ingenious and difficult to counterattack. Therefore, the competition between the two was extremely urgent. Sun's final victory was entirely due to his skillful use of his strengths.</p>
<p>Today's Program: At 5:00 PM this afternoon, Zheng Guiguang will play his second performance match with Hong Yukui, a good player of the YMCA. Hong is the most promising young man in the Shanghai handball world. He has many strengths and can compete with Mr. Zheng. Who will win is another highlight.</p>

<p>North China Swimming Competition</p>
<h3>Beijing Athletes May Participate</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 7th) The Sports Committee held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM on the 7th to discuss the issue of Beijing athletes registering late for the 18th North China Swimming Competition. Le Yongnian, the director of the social affairs bureau's middle school, attended the meeting to explain the process. After discussion, it was believed that according to the Sports Committee's regulations, late registration had no room for compromise. However, (1) the registration deadline fell on a Sunday, and (2) the nature of the team and individual was slightly different. The competition location is in Beijing, and it would be contrary to the purpose of promoting sports if Beijing athletes were excluded. It was necessary to seek remedies. As a result, representatives from the five units of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin suggested to the conference that they be allowed to participate in the conference. The conference has accepted, but according to the rules of the Sports Committee, it must be approved by a joint meeting before a decision can be made. The conference has scheduled a joint meeting on the 10th to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>From Face to Legs and Feet</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Where do imported cosmetics go? Even legs and feet are now made up!</p>
<p>Recently, a staff member of a major cosmetics company in Peiping (Beijing) reported: Currently, there are three types of leg makeup products used by women in Peiping. The first is nail polish for toenails, available in red, blue, purple, and yellow, all colors are complete, French products, each bottle costs two to seventeen or eighteen yuan. The second is skin fragrance cream, which is applied to the legs, ankles, insteps, heels, and toes, its purpose is to moisturize the skin, its fat content is especially rich compared to face creams, if applied properly, it is not difficult to become like solidified fat, the best of this cream costs five to twenty yuan per bottle. The third is flesh-colored powder, which is used after applying the cream, its purpose is to cool, dry, and brighten, therefore, once the makeup of the legs is completed, each time takes more than an hour, costing three to more than ten yuan, and the result is that it consumes a lot of foreign goods, and shakes the youth, therefore, although Peiping Mayor Yuan Liang banned women from going barefoot with bare legs, even though we merchants suffer a temporary loss, it is of great benefit to the social economy and national wealth. This news is very interesting, but very alarming, because such modern women like to be fashionable, resulting in several phenomena, directly:</p>
<p>(1) The import of cosmetics, creams, and perfumes in the first half of this year was 850,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The import of perfumes and creams in June alone was 144,044 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) The lace for fashionable women's clothing in the first half of this year was 577,962 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Several domestic sock factories are suffering from poor business and are asking the government to ban bizarre costumes.</p>
<p>(5) Men's burdens are increasing day by day, debts are increasing, and those who break promises, commit fraud, abscond, and commit suicide are also increasing in number. Indirectly:</p>
<p>(1) Rural bankruptcy is becoming more rapid.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic industries are increasingly overwhelmed by foreign goods.</p>
<p>(3) The national economy is increasingly shrinking, gradually entering a state of depletion.</p>
<p>(4) Foreigners leave fully loaded, manufacturing guns, cannons, and airplanes, in addition to economic aggression, and then military aggression.</p>
<p>Modern women, with a smile, can ruin finance and weaken national power to such an extent. The magic power of modern women is indeed considerable. Like mother, like daughter. Where there are modern women, there are modern children. The import of foreign toys in the first half of the year was also more than 570,000 yuan. This is all the blood and sweat of the people, brazenly rewarding foreigners without stinginess, what a heartbreaking thing. In this National Products Year, this phenomenon is even more distressing. In fact, it is best not to use rouge, powder, and face cream. If you do use them, there are domestic products, why must you use foreign goods as a glory. All these makeup products, used to apply to the face, already feel extravagant, but now they want to apply them to the legs and feet, to win the appreciation of men, what is their intention? It is perplexing to think about. I know that women's patriotism will not lag behind others, perhaps they do not know the gains and losses in this, it is up to family mothers and sisters, school teachers, social leaders, and groups enthusiastic about national products, based on the spirit of loving national products, using eloquent words, to persuade people they meet, without fear of tiring their lips, if everyone can be vigilant and change the atmosphere, perhaps next year's import report can save this improper expenditure, save bankrupt rural areas, and support the vitality of industry and commerce, so that in the Women's National Products Year, some achievements can be seen, I think that at this time, modern women will not be criticized by the world, and scolded by people.</p>
<p>Talking about National Products</p>
<h3>Psychological Construction of the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Nanguo Jiaren</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of small merchants selling odd pieces of cloth in the inland rural areas has been increasing day by day, but their profits have been decreasing day by day. According to the moans of those merchants, selling inferior goods is more profitable. If they wholesale national products purely, they cannot even sell enough to cover the cost. The reason is very simple: the honest and cowardly old people in the rural areas have not heard the tragic cries of their countrymen who have lost their country in the Northeast, they have not seen the ruined walls of Zhabei and Wusong, their concept of the enemy is still vague. They do not have the ability to distinguish between national products and foreign goods. In order to save a few copper coins to buy oil and rice, they would rather buy those cheap and beautiful foreign goods to make new clothes for their innocent children.</p>
<p>In terms of daily necessities, we all know that: some foreign goods are genuinely expensive compared to domestic products; some foreign goods are of the same quality as domestic products, but much cheaper. The reason why it's like this is due to other's lower production costs and the higher costs for domestic products. Merchants cannot ignore capital, and the poor consumers, for their own livelihood, are penny-pinching. So promoting national products has become just a nice-sounding slogan.</p>
<p>Since the national products movement aims solely to stimulate national consumption of domestic industrial products, the fundamental solution lies in reducing production costs so that the prices of national products are at least lower than those of the same products from foreign merchants or foreign factories in China. The methods to reduce production costs lie in improving production technology and adjusting tariffs. These two important tasks depend on the active struggle of the domestic industrial sector and the domestic government. This is not an easy task in the short term. Therefore, during this transition period, the consuming public should awaken a kind of national spirit to earnestly engage in the psychological construction of consuming national products.</p>
<p>The psychological analysis of people who like to use imported goods can be summarized as follows: among the people in the bourgeoisie, it is nothing more than (1) love of luxury; (2) love of fashion; (3) love of good goods that are durable. In the common people, in addition to having the above three psychologies, they also have (1) the psychology of being greedy for cheap things; (2) the psychology of liking good looks; (3) the psychology of not being responsible.</p>
<p>People who like to use imported goods are not ignorant people, perhaps they have a lot of superior intelligence. Their psychology may be that China will not be destroyed because one person likes to use foreign goods; nor will it suddenly become a rich and powerful country because one person uses all domestic products. Their psychology is that giving up cheap and beautiful imported goods to buy only domestic products is an invisible loss to personal or family finances, which is not something a smart person does.</p>
<p>These morbid psychologies are the great enemies of the national products movement. They are much stronger than the tangible power of enemy planes and cannons. We must correct them!</p>
<h3>"Start with Myself"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>| A Message to Women Across the Country |</p>
<p>"The evolution of history is always forward." If we base ourselves on this sentence, stand at this stage, grasp reality, and go on a pilgrimage to "promote national products," then I think the display of facts will definitely make you feel extremely disappointed. Of course, here, let's not talk about anything else, just take the past seven months of this "Women's National Products Year," there has been no good news about the development of the national products, but the voices of foreign goods flooding and selling like crazy are constantly disturbing our ears. The International Trade Bureau recently announced that the import surplus for the first six months of this year was 30 million yuan, of which women's luxury goods such as perfumes, creams, and cosmetics accounted for more than 970,000 yuan, and the lace used for cheongsam trimming also reached 600,000 yuan, and the import of imported silk and satin is countless. The only result we hoped for from the women's community is such an alarming performance, which is enough to make us not only "disappointed" but also feel deeply "heartbroken."</p>
<p>However, why is the progress of national products so stagnant and difficult to develop? Then I dare say that the crux of the problem is purely obscured by a kind of bad psychology. The fact is that there are countless Chinese people who hold this kind of inferior mentality. They think that there are more than 450 million people in the country! My personal use of foreign goods to take advantage of some cheap things is irrelevant to the overall situation and will not affect the rise and fall of the entire economy. Therefore, they use foreign goods and enemy goods in a big way. But they don't know that assuming every Chinese person is like this, as long as each person's import surplus is two yuan per year, the total of 450 million people is already an astonishing 900 million yuan. Then think about it, should this bad idea of ours still exist? I'm afraid that the more it exists, the more our flesh and blood will be exploited by others, and the closer we will be to the day of national subjugation and family destruction.</p>
<p>Therefore, from this very good lesson, the psychology of "starting with myself" has also become the only way to remedy the reality. Originally, promoting national products is entirely based on practical work, everyone must be determined, everyone must work hard. This year is designated as "Women's National Products Year," and people's hopes for the women's community are very deep and earnest. Then I, as a housewife, should understand this point even more, fundamentally repent of my previous "selfish" thoughts, and based on the spirit of "starting with myself," vow to use national products from today onwards to reverse the misfortune of this "Women's National Products Year" and create a glorious page.</p>
<h3>Community Education Personnel Should Take the Responsibility of Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Talking about the issue of national products, everyone said in unison: "Promoting national products naturally requires the joint efforts of people across the country, and those in power should lead by example, then the virtue of a gentleman, like the wind, will spread throughout the country, and its effect will be even greater, but the fundamental problem is that we still believe that we should start with education, and do our best to instill the concept of using national products in children's education, to lay a deep-rooted foundation for the future of national products, of course, is a great long-term plan, but in order to save the current crisis of the national products movement, social education should especially take on the responsibility of promoting and using national products.</p>
<h3>New Hope for National Products</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Because the people who serve in community education agencies are in contact with the general public every day, what they hear and see has a greater impact…" This argument, the reporter believes, is worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the staff of community education agencies have the responsibility of training the masses, educating the masses, and guiding the masses, their mission is very important. Therefore, it is inevitable for community education staff to be in contact with the masses from time to time. When in contact with the masses, the first thing to do is to give the general public a good impression. If a community education worker in a suit and leather shoes runs to the countryside to talk to the masses, the timid masses will have already fled and dare not approach you, even if the masses who come to approach you, you can't arouse their belief and sympathy no matter what, not only that, I am afraid that you will also get bad ideas? There used to be a joke that a community education agency in a certain place once held a national products exhibition. When the meeting was held, quite a few people came. A gentleman in a Western suit went up to give a speech, advocating the importance of national products, before he could say anything, a member of the public in the crowd stood up and questioned: "Today is a national products movement, we do not welcome rich old men in Western suits to come on stage to speak," this caused the sympathy of the whole audience, and this friend in a Western suit, turned red in the face, retreated in embarrassment, this is a real situation, it can be a serious lesson for community education personnel, from this matter, it can be seen how important it is to lead by example? The compass of national community education personnel, especially the leaders of a community education agency, everyone should be like this, everyone should be like this, then, approaching the general public, what they say is especially effective, at the same time, wearing national products clothing and talking to the public about promoting national products is especially pleasant to hear, especially to make people believe, this is something that national community education personnel must pay attention to.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that the leaders of national community education agencies and comrades who are dedicated to social education will all take on the responsibility of promoting and using national products, then, the virtue of a gentleman, like the wind, can naturally influence the general public.</p>
<h3>Thinking of Huishan Clay Figures from the Import of Toys</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>In the National Products Year, amidst the calls for promoting national products, foreign goods are coming in an endless stream, this is really a strange phenomenon in our country! It is also a unique shame that our country cannot wash away! Great humiliation!</p>
<p>According to a report released by the International Trade Bureau on August 2, the import of games and toys in the first six months of this year was 292.195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 yuan in national currency, which is a significant increase compared to the import of 233.188 gold units in the first six months of last year.</p>
<p>If children's toys must be bought from foreign countries, it is enough to cultivate in children the psychology of buying foreign goods and despising domestic goods. Who should be responsible for this?</p>
<p>From the import of toys, I think of our Wuxi Huishan clay figures. The development of handicrafts, those who travel to Wuxi all know that the small clay toys are all ingenious and lifelike, what birds, beasts, ancient sages! All kinds of Peking Opera, exquisitely crafted, but unfortunately they cannot be scientificized, using models for casting, without research by soil scientists! There is no large-scale organized toy company, no other agencies that promote them effectively, and finally, they are stuck in their ways! There is no ability to export them abroad! Seeing foreign toys anesthetizing our children! It is really a heartbreaking thing! I hope to start with improving Huishan clay figures and promoting Huishan clay figures, collecting self-made toys from all over the country, and we will launch a movement to clear out foreign toys! By this time next year, we will no longer see the alarming numbers of toy imports!</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>Talking about Women's National Products Year from the Consumption of Lace</h3>
<p>— Yao Chengxuan</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." Liang Qichao said in his theory of the demise of the Qing Dynasty in the Eastern News: "There is no greater tragedy than the loss of the country." After reading these two insightful remarks, we should at least feel the deep-seated pain of wanting to cry but having no tears for this broken family with broken mountains and rivers! The old hatred of last year's National Products Year has not been removed, and the new sorrow of this year's Women's National Products Year has come one after another. May I ask, how many people have realized the "responsibility" of "the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of everyone" and shouldered the heavy responsibility? Shanghai is the largest port in East Asia, where the prosperity, commerce, and culture of the whole country are concentrated. Material civilization is, of course, higher than the inland to the boiling point with the eastward spread of the European style and the irrigation of the American rain. We are grieving the huge consumption of perfumes and creams and the outflow of money. Who knows that the lace for these decorations consumes 600,000 yuan in half a year. This is such a regrettable thing. Although the love of beauty is human nature, patriotism is also human nature. People are not made of wood or stone, how can they be without feeling, can it be that Chinese people are cold-blooded animals? Moreover, the promoters of lace are partly women, because women's vanity is more intense than men's. They do not hesitate to spend useful money and precious time on this worthless clothing. Alas! For the sake of the dispensable lace, they do not even care about the country, how lamentable! Moreover, national products lace is no less decent when decorated on clothes. The term Women's National Products Year is so glorious. Women standing on the greatness of the times should be so vigilant! To save this precarious ruined family!</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the Women's National Products Year? Why is this year designated as Women's National Products Year? What is the result since the women were allowed to do it? Time is passing like water, and there are only four months left from beginning to end! I hope that women will have some achievements in this short period and become a model.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Products Should Show More National Products Films</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>When we promote national products, we should not only pay attention to clothing, food, and goods, but we should pay attention everywhere, and even in terms of entertainment, we should also care about national products. For example, when hosting banquets and socializing, we do not necessarily have to use foreign alcoholic beverages, the things produced in our China are not necessarily inferior to imported goods! Secondly, the import of cosmetics is also extremely alarming, why bother to give useful money to others for the cost of guns and bombs? In order to save the rights and interests of the motherland from overflowing, everyone should pay attention to national products and not like to buy other people's things, thinking it is luxurious.</p>
<p>I am a movie fan, I like to watch movies. Fortunately, my appetite is the same, regardless of good or bad, regardless of superiority or inferiority, as long as I have the time, I will go to the movie theater. Fortunately, the movies in Suzhou are cheap and beautiful, so every Saturday and Sunday, I have become a regular customer of the movie theater. Sometimes I am invited by friends, and I also go to enjoy them in the remaining days. Perhaps Chinese people's psychology of worshiping foreign films is more intense! Even people who do not understand English (this refers to talkies) also like to watch foreign films, listening to difficult to understand languages seems to surpass national films, I do not know what this psychology is?</p>
<p>I happened to flip through the local supplement of a certain newspaper on July 30, in which the movie theaters showing foreign films accounted for three-quarters, which shows the worship of foreign films by the people of Shanghai. But even in the interior, Suzhou is not the same? It seems that after watching a foreign film, even if the plot is sometimes incomprehensible, many people think it is very interesting! The expenditure of this money, when I think about it, is no less than the import of cosmetics! But to clarify my intention, we are not rejecting foreign films, at least we should show more domestic films, so that Chinese films can progress and flourish, otherwise, foreign films will fill the market, and Chinese films will not be hit? In all conscience, some companies in China produce films that are not so bad, and are worth watching at least to some extent. Since there are domestic films to watch, then why spend tens of thousands of money to give to others? Therefore, my argument is that to promote national products, we should show national products films, which is also a very valuable issue, and has a lot to do with the Chinese economy. People who care about the future of national products should think about how to reverse the psychology of the Chinese people to value national films.</p>
<p>Finally, I am not criticizing the badness of foreign films, I think nine out of ten foreign films are sensual films of the kind with flying jade legs and prominent breasts, which makes young people a little demonic to see, this is the truth, I like to say it thoroughly, except for military films, most are sensual films, under the guidance of the new life in China, I think people in the new life should work hard and strive to be strong, and advance aggressively, is it possible to lose their souls under the flying jade legs and prominent breasts? (Of course, I am even more opposed to dance troupes)</p>
<p>From this point of view, people who are enthusiastic about national products should also pay attention to promoting national products, and should show more national products films, this issue is somewhat worthy of discussion?</p>
<p>Short story</p>
<h3>Yellow Mud Ridge</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Daytime: Singing Songs of Grievance, a Resourceful Star Delivering Patriotic Speeches</p>
<p>The scorching sun burns like fire, half the rice in the fields withers. The farmers’ hearts are like boiling water: Young masters and noble sons wave their fans.</p>
<p>It is said that Bai Rishu, Bai Sheng, carrying a wine peddler’s pole, sang that folk song as he walked along the Yellow Mud Ridge road. It was midday, the sun blazing fiercely, with not a cloud in the sky. He was so tired that beads of sweat as big as soybeans hung from his temples. However, the sight of one hundred thousand strings of gold and jewels glittered before him, making him forget the heat. Ignoring whether it was against the law, he felt light on his feet and full of energy, walking step by step up the ridge. When he reached the pine forest, there was no sign of Yang Zhi's group, only Chao Gai, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng, Liu Tang, and the three Ruan brothers, seven men in total, disguised as date merchants. They had several Jiangzhou carts and were also waiting. Bai Sheng greeted the seven men, panting, and said, "Could it be that those guys didn't take this road? Otherwise, they should have arrived." Chi Fa Gui Liu Tang said, "I heard reliably that they would definitely come this way. Perhaps there were some mishaps along the way, so they were delayed." Ruan Xiaoqi shouted loudly, "To hell with it! We'll wait here, even for ten days or half a month. If other merchants pass by, we'll give them a small profit first, and we'll at least get some grease." Chao Gai nodded in agreement. As they were talking, Ruan Xiaoer pointed to the hillside to the north and said, "Isn't that a group of people coming? It might be Yang Zhi sending the treasure to us." Wu Yong instructed them to keep their voices down and follow the plan. After a short while, the group reached the bottom of the pine forest. The heat was unbearable, so they unloaded their burdens and sat down in the shade. Ruan Xiaowu, wielding a broadsword, jumped out of the forest and shouted at the group, "Those who know what's good for them, leave your toll money!" When the group saw Ruan Xiaowu's ferocious appearance and aggressive manner, one of them crawled to the ground begging for mercy. Several of the bolder ones pleaded, "Great King! Have pity on us, we used up our capital and energy to go to Hebei to sell local products, planning to go to Tokyo to earn some money. Who knew that there would be heavy customs duties and extortion along the way? The cost of these goods is already not light. Whether we can sell them in Tokyo is still a question. Nowadays, the noble sons and daughters don't like our local products, instead, they are making goods for those red-haired merchants. We have already suffered enough, where would we get gold and silver to offer to you Great Kings!" Ruan Xiaowu glared and said, "I don't care about that. Give money if you have it, give your life if you don't." As he spoke, he thrust his broadsword down. At that moment, Wu Xuejiu from the forest, who had been listening for a long time, jumped out and said, "Brothers, don't be rash, listen to me. These merchants are selling local products, whether they make money or lose money, the money is always in their own pockets. Like a Chu bow being found by a Chu person, it doesn't harm the country's lifeline. Moreover, they are not greedy for heavy profits and are unwilling to give money to foreigners, truly commendable and praiseworthy for their patriotism. Although we robbers have no conscience, we also have hearts. How can we lay a cruel hand on such admirable people? It's just a pity that the current officials are muddleheaded, only knowing to exploit these people, not protecting them, instead, letting those red-haired merchants act rampant, using worthless goods to cheat our money, using our money to recruit soldiers and buy horses, and store up grain. In three to five years, they will definitely start a war. Do you think this is painful or not!" As Wu Yong said this, Ruan Xiaoqi jumped out from the side and shouted loudly, "Isn't this infuriating! We don't want to rob any birthday gifts or be greedy for wealth, let's go up the mountain to kill those red-haired foreigners!" Wu Yong waved his hand again and said, "Brothers, don't be impatient. These red-haired foreigners are just doing business, they haven't committed any major crimes, we have no reason to kill them. We should lead by example, not using red-haired goods ourselves. Then we should punish those profiteering merchants who sell smuggled goods, and those who love using foreign goods, that's the right thing to do!" Everyone nodded in agreement upon hearing these words. If you want to know what happens next? There's no explanation in the next installment, readers can guess for themselves!</p>

<h3>Soda</h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>Characters: Customer, Shop Assistant</p>
<p>Time: Afternoon of a certain day in the summer of the 23rd year</p>
<p>Setting: A refreshment shop, with a shop assistant tending the store. (The curtain opens, a customer enters from outside.)</p>
<p>Customer: Get me a bottle of soda!</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: What brand do you want?</p>
<p>Customer: (Sitting down) Of course, XXX. What good are Chinese goods?</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: Chinese goods aren't bad either. The fizz is strong enough!</p>
<p>Customer: (Showing impatience) I only want XXX. (Pointing inside) Hurry up and get it.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: (Enters without a word), (Takes out a soda, pours it into a glass, places it in front of the customer) Sir! Isn't this flavor good?</p>
<p>Customer: (Drinking and speaking) XXX is definitely better than Chinese goods! Look at how good foreign goods are.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: (Smiling) Sir! Please forgive me, because I did something deceptive. Do you think this is XXX? It's not, it's a domestic product!</p>
<p>Customer: (Appearing surprised) This is really a domestic product? How is the taste almost the same as foreign goods?</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: Sir! It's all in the psychology. If you think domestic goods are good, then when you drink domestic goods, you will feel they are good. If you think domestic goods are bad, then when you drink domestic goods, you will also feel they are bad. You often think foreign goods are good, then unconsciously when you drink them, you will also think they are foreign goods. In reality, domestic goods and foreign goods are not much different.</p>
<p>Customer: (Slightly ashamed), Quick! Bring another bottle! (Curtain closes)</p>

<h3>Introducing a type of summer shoes</h3>
<p>— Bian Beichen</p>
<p>Shoes, especially women's shoes, because they want to make themselves more beautiful, they do not hesitate to sacrifice a lot of money to buy foreign leather shoes. Although there are also many made by Chinese people, the raw materials are inevitably imported!</p>
<p>If we make a detailed statistics of the raw materials imported over the years, it will be a very shocking number.</p>
<p>Now it is summer, and the general modern ladies and misses are wearing the most popular European and American leather shoes that expose their toes. It is said that the only reason is that they are cool, comfortable, and beautiful, but in the coolness, comfort, and beauty, they unconsciously send many airplanes and cannons to foreigners.</p>
<p>Let me introduce a kind of purely domestic shoes, the raw materials are made of flower ribbons and white cloth soles; they can also expose the toes and are cool, comfortable and beautiful. In the past, they were adopted by monks and nuns, but recently most of the women in this city wear them, and their beauty is not inferior to imported leather shoes.</p>
<p>It is said that the purchase of the shoes is in the larger temples and stores selling Buddhist supplies everywhere.</p>
<p>Now I will write the advantages of the shoes below: (1) The price is fair, only four or five corners of silver per pair.</p>
<p>(2) The material is light and easy to travel long distances;</p>
<p>(3) Completely domestic products, no leaks.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that general movie stars, dance queens, social butterflies, will unanimously promote them; at the same time, I hope that women! come to purchase them unanimously.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Reading (II)</h3>
<p>— Yan Yu</p>
<p>Even in the same era and the same country, people can say things that others cannot understand.</p>
<p>Barbusse has a very interesting short story called "Native Language and Foreign Language," which records how a wealthy family in France entertained three soldiers who had gone through life and death in the European War. The lady of the house came out to greet them, but they had nothing to say. They forced themselves to say a few words, but they had nothing to answer. They only felt that they were sitting in a large room and were careful enough to hurt their bones. It was not until they sneaked back to their own "pigsty" that they felt comfortable all over, talking and laughing, and in the German prisoners, they discovered people who spoke their "our language" through gestures.</p>
<p>Because of this experience, one soldier vaguely thought: "There are two worlds in this world. One is the world of war. The other is the world of clean kitchens, beautiful houses, like chapels with safe-deposit boxes. It is a completely different world. A different country. Inside, there live strange-thinking foreigners."</p>
<p>What the lady later said to a gentleman was: "It is impossible to talk to them. It seems that there is an insurmountable abyss between them and us."</p>
<p>In fact, it is not necessary for the lady and the soldiers to be like this. Even we—whether considered "feudal remnants" or "compradors" or anything else—and almost the same kind of people, as long as there are some differences in some places, and if we have to be of one mind, we often cannot help but have nothing to say to each other. However, we Chinese are smart, and some people have already invented a panacea, which is "The weather today... hahaha!" If it is a banquet, we only guess fists and do not make any arguments.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it may be really difficult for literature to be universal and permanent. "The weather today... hahaha!" Although it is somewhat universal, it is very doubtful whether it can be permanent, and it does not look much like literature. So a superb writer has set a rule for himself, pushing all those who do not understand his "literature" out of "humanity" in order to maintain its universality. Literature also has other characteristics, but he is unwilling to say it, so he has no choice but to use this method. However, in this way, "literature" exists, but there are not many "people".</p>
<p>So it is said that the more superb the literature, the fewer people who understand it. At the extreme of superbness, universality and permanence only converge on the author alone. However, the writer becomes sad again, saying that he is spitting blood. There is really no way to imagine it.</p>
<h3>Night Notes from the Borderlands (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>They should have spent the night in the town of "Yache Xun," but fearing an attack by mountain bandits, the merchant escort team advanced another ten miles in the dim twilight of the small wilderness. By the time the men and horses approached Qingkou, the deep blue night sky was already full of blossoming, radiant star flowers.</p>
<p>Qingkou is a small village facing the main road, and the residents are all farmers. When the merchant escort team's storm lanterns swayed with long white light, slowly entering the village, short houses, round haystacks, and dark, dense miscellaneous trees appeared everywhere.</p>
<p>The village dog had just barked loudly, rushing over fiercely, but immediately let out a long howl and fled behind the house lurking in the night shadow. Then there were sudden sounds of doors closing everywhere, and the crying of children.</p>
<p>The village, quietly crouching under the starry sky, was awakened in an instant, trembling. The sweat of men and horses completely washed away the scent of flowers, plants, and resins that had previously been floating in the air.</p>
<p>Almost every household had brothers from the merchant escort team walking in, placing their guns in the corner of the room, and sitting or lying down on benches and tables at will. I was not very happy to rest with them, so I planned to find a remote little house—a place where the brothers from the merchant escort team did not like to go. As a result, I found it at the end of the village. The door was closed, and there was only a faint light in the house, leaking out from the cracks in the wooden walls. Perhaps she heard my footsteps, the light in the house suddenly went out, but I did not care whether the owner of the house welcomed me or not, and went straight forward to knock on the door. After a while, because the door was knocked too hard, I heard an old woman's voice, trembling, saying, "Have pity on us! There is nothing left here!... Alas, great merciful Bodhisattva!"</p>
<p>"Old Mama, don't be afraid, I'm here to borrow a place to stay,... I'm a good person!</p>
<p>After a period of silence, perhaps she was beginning to examine me through the crack in the door, she made a breathless sound, but slightly calmer than just now.</p>
<p>"Then, then, guest, please go to another house,... it's terribly narrow here!"</p>
<p>"Old Mama, other houses are full of people, please let me stay for one night, I'll give you money."</p>
<p>Seeing that she was still doubting me, I pleaded very sincerely. She did not answer, I only felt the sound of her footsteps lightly響to 裏面went. I stood for a while, planning to leave, but suddenly heard someone coming out from 裏面, a man's voice saying this.</p>
<p>"Old Mama, it doesn't matter, everything is looked after by the Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva will take care of you!"</p>
<h3>Impressions of Zibo</h3>
<p>— Luo Wang</p>
<p>(6) The Life of Miners</p>
<p>In Zichuan, we saw countless people who looked like black slaves, or like "bumpkins" in a circus, their faces covered in black dirt, only revealing two big white eyes, looking at people! These people are coal miners!</p>
<p>We made some small visits to the life of miners, but did not get much information. But just to say about the miners of the Luda Company, there are many types, from going down the well to dig coal, underground transportation, screening workers, etc. Naturally, the workers who go down the well suffer the most. They go deep into the underground layer, 300 to 700 meters below. Their only good friend is a mine lamp! They work every day, day and night shifts are more than twelve hours, and the wages used to be good, about two or three yuan, but now they are only five or six mao to eight or nine mao per day!</p>
<p>What miners fear most is heavy rain, because this can cause water to flood the mine, with the fear of being drowned. Therefore, workers usually avoid the word "full." When pouring wine, "full" is only said to be "empty"! This is a special explanation in the life of miners!</p>
<p>There are even more miners in Boshan! Most residents rely on working as miners for a living! There are also countless coal loaders.</p>
<p>In the past, workers' lives were very prosperous because coal could be sold at a good price, and labor prices were therefore high. The old-style small-scale (most of which are still like this) mines would dig a tunnel about three feet high in winter, and the workers had to bend over and crawl on the ground to move forward. Although the work was hard, the reward was very rich. Workers often worked for one day, got two or three yuan in reward, and then rested for two days. Because money came easily, workers have always been living for the day, until the money was used up before going to grab the coal mine! At that time, the workers wore silk and ate oil, so there were many silk shops and restaurants in Boshan. When the great tide of the world's economic panic pressed tightly on the mining area, the dumping of foreign coal blocked the sales of Chinese coal, so labor prices gradually declined! In the past, just pushing coal dregs could earn more than two yuan a day, but now pushing it for a day is less than one yuan, the cost of living is gradually increasing, and income is gradually decreasing; so in Boshan, although there are big landlords who have made hundreds of thousands of fortunes by opening mines, at the same time, countless workers suffering from economic oppression have naturally been produced! So in Boshan, there are always people hanging themselves every day!</p>
<p>The place where we performed dramas was called Shanghetan, which is a kiln goods market! On weekdays (when there are no market days), it is said that no one easily passes by there, because every night you can hear ghosts crying and gods wailing. These words are of course rumors from the locals, but they can confirm that there are indeed many people who "hang themselves in the southeast branches"! Our partner once went to a forest and saw a person hanging high in the sky with his neck tied to the tree branch! This kind of death is caused by the social and economic situation. I don't want to make any arguments here, I just want to ask everyone to pay attention to the current facts!</p>

<h3>I Come From the East (18)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>After the ship left Kobe, several Cantonese on the ship seriously considered the issue of landing. They had earned money in the United States for decades and were now returning to their hometown to retire. They were talking furtively in the smoking room, saying how terrible Shanghai was at night. If you have a gold ring on your finger, someone will pull you away. If you wear better clothes, someone will pour acid on you. If people know you have money, you will be kidnapped or killed. They told each other in whispers, as if a great disaster was imminent.</p>
<p>A Cantonese couple who had run a restaurant in Chicago were especially afraid. The wife was a young and somewhat romantic Chinese-American girl from San Francisco, and insisted on going to Shanghai that day. The husband was old and had earned tens of thousands of dollars. He felt that everywhere in China, hands were reaching out for his money or his life, so he insisted on spending the night on the ship and would not disembark until he reached Hong Kong. He told me that China was not good. When he opened a restaurant in Chicago, whenever someone came from China, they either wanted to raise money for schools or for airplanes. He had to spend thousands of dollars every year to deal with these things. I think what he said was sincere.</p>
<p>The setting sun shone on the yellow waves. A large group of passengers gathered on the deck, everyone harboring curiosity and fear about Shanghai. Two extremely thin shadows of the shore lined the mouth of the Yangtze River, the shore shadows closing on us, and gradually we saw three or five sailboats ahead. Approaching Wusongkou, everyone on deck pointed and talked about the situation during the Battle of Shanghai. The sailors on the ship, because they had witnessed the battle firsthand on the ship during the war, described it even more vividly. Everyone talked about this event like Investiture of the Gods or Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Curious Americans regretted not seeing this good show with their own eyes.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived at the Pudong Old Taikoo Wharf, it was already dusk. Coal smoke mixed with the evening mist, shrouding the entire city of Shanghai in a gray curtain. The Sassoon Mansion and the HSBC Bank, the Customs Clock Tower and the unfinished International Hotel, all revealed faint shadows. The Huangpu River was really narrow. When our postal ship turned around, the ship's body crossed the river, locking the entire river, making it difficult for any ships to come and go. I then thought of the story of the sunken ship in Lushun Port during the Russo-Japanese War. I also fantasized about various thought-provoking phenomena and strategies that would occur if an international war broke out in the Far East.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of buzzing sounds. Of all the noisy ports in the world, this one is probably the first. In the evening, I hastily took a small motorboat from the Old Taikoo Wharf to the New Customs Wharf with a few friends from the ship. The small boat was crowded with people. The small river was crowded with boats. The roads were crowded with cars. It seemed that there was no room to move anywhere. The New Customs Wharf was even more crowded. It is a country with a small land area and a large population, but at the wharves of Kobe and Yokohama, you can barely see a few people. Commerce in New York and London must be more prosperous than Shanghai, but you will never be squeezed in a crowd when you arrive in New York and London. A population of 400 million is a formidable force, but if 400 million people are squeezed together in chaos, there is nothing to fear.</p>
<h3>Regarding the "?" in the First Section of "Zibo Impressions"</h3>
<p>Letter from Luo Wangjun:</p>
<p>The first section of this article mentions that the audience watching the play consisted of two to three "thousand" people! The editor added a "?" under the word "thousand," perhaps doubting the accuracy! However, it is common for our outdoor performances to attract two to three thousand people. This is an "actual number" and has a different meaning from the common phrase "tens of thousands of attendees" at general XX sports meets. Therefore, if anyone does not believe it, I can report further that when we screen movies in various counties, residents from twenty miles outside the city also come to watch, with at least ten thousand people every night, and sometimes up to thirty or forty thousand. A vast open space is filled with people sitting on the ground, all looking up at the silver screen. This is something that friends in the South might find hard to imagine, but in the hot, less-educated North, this kind of fact is not surprising!</p>

<p>Financial Circles Absorb Vast Amounts,</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Soars to New Heights</h3>
<p>Distant Months Discover a New Peak of 192 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the situation is becoming increasingly tight. This has been brewing for a long time, and once it erupts, it is difficult to contain. The biggest reason for this surge is partly due to the continuous procurement of current yarn from North and Central China. Dealers from Tianjin consider Chinese yarn to be cheaper than Japanese yarn and are particularly eager to acquire coarse yarn. Another factor is that all factories have reported being sold out of 16-count yarn, with some factories already experiencing shortages. Furthermore, the prices of flour and wheat have recently soared, leading to large profits for financial circles. As a result, they have changed their plans and are also absorbing large amounts in the cotton yarn market for speculation. Consequently, confidence is boosted, and buying surges, leading to the discovery of a new peak of 192 yuan for distant months.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Jumps Wildly by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened with an unstoppable momentum. Buyers are showing great appetite, as financiers, having profited handsomely from flour and wheat, are now flocking to the cotton yarn market to buy in bulk. Simultaneously, spot yarn sales to customers are thriving daily, depleting factory inventories considerably. This boosts confidence, tightens the market, and causes short sellers to panic. The market already had the potential to rise earlier, but it was suppressed by Japanese merchants selling off and by the pressure of goods in cotton yarn warehouses, leading to a temporary slump. Recently, support from actual sales in the North has triggered new buying activity, and money houses are buying at market prices without price limits. The market suddenly surges wildly, rising higher and higher, with the upward trend intensifying. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2.478 jiao to 3.2 jiao. The total volume traded was 88,550 bales. Sales were as follows: Da Ji 2,550 bales, Xin Chang 1,500 bales, Yuan Da 1,250 bales, Jin Chang 2,250 bales, Ming De 1,350 bales, Chang Ji 1,750 bales, Jun Chang 1,250 bales, Sen Kang 1,550 bales, Tong Feng 1,150 bales, Heng De 950 bales, Ren Feng 2,750 bales, Yi Chang 5,800 bales, Heng Chang 4,650 bales, Xie Sheng 950 bales. Purchases were as follows: Ji Feng 2,200 bales, Da Fu 1,150 bales, Tong Fu 3,100 bales, Tong Ji 1,900 bales, Heng Yi 1,000 bales, Da Feng 2,100 bales, Zhen Da 2,150 bales, Hui Kang 1,350 bales, Shen Chang 1,200 bales, Tong Xing 1,050 bales, Yi Da 1,250 bales, Yuan Yi 2,350 bales, Chang Feng 2,350 bales, Run Kang 6,350 bales, Yong Da 950 bales, De Ji 900 bales, Yuan De 800 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Open Account Number</p>
<p>August 185.1 183.5 185.1 Rise 2.40 50,750</p>
<p>September 186.4 185.5 186.4 Rise 2.40 54,000</p>

<p>January 192.0 190.8 192.0 Rise 2.70 11,000</p>
<p>Total 244,300</p>
<h3>Continuous Procurement of Spot Yarn from North and Central China</h3>
<p>Sales of spot yarn remain robust. Total purchases by various groups throughout the day were 1,225 bales, with prices rising by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Haizhou 75, Inland 480, Guangdong 90, Changsha 120</p>
<p>Nanjing 5, Henan 40, Sichuan 50, Northern Group 5</p>
<p>Same Trade 250</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Surge Triggers Fluctuations in Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward, with the situation continuing to strengthen. With American cotton stable and cotton yarn surging wildly, the closely related cotton market is increasingly agitated. However, as prices rise, Tong Bang and Yuan Da, in particular, are selling heavily, and all sales are being absorbed by financial circles. Therefore, both sides have considerable opposing forces. However, as manufacturers still show no signs of purchasing, the cotton market's upward momentum is not as strong as that of the yarn market. The American cotton acreage report is expected to be released tomorrow, which should bring about some changes in the cotton market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rises by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market opened this morning with a tighter atmosphere due to the surge in the yarn market and the rise in American cotton prices. Financial circles are buying in bulk without price limits, causing the market to surge. Da Fu and Yuan Da are selling off aggressively, causing the market atmosphere to weaken slightly. However, the amount sold is being absorbed by the bullish side. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.45 to 0.5 yuan. With this large volume of trading, the market outlook remains highly volatile. Sales were as follows: Da Fu 33,000 dan, Yuan Da 18,500 dan, Da Ji 2,300 dan, Hui Kang 4,300 dan, Ming De 1,600 dan, Jun Chang 2,200 dan, Heng De 1,700 dan, Yuan Yi 17,100 dan, Tai Chang 1,200 dan, Xie Cheng 2,000 dan, Da Chang 2,900 dan, Xin Heng 3,900 dan, Yi Feng 3,200 dan. Purchases were as follows: Chang Feng 10,700 dan, Run Kang 11,600 dan, Xin Cheng 10,500 dan, Ji Feng 2,200 dan, Tong Fu 5,000 dan, Tong Ji 6,700 dan, Yu Kang 1,500 dan, Da Feng 1,900 dan, Tai Xing 4,600 dan, Shen Chang 8,400 dan, Rui Da 4,100 dan, Shen Ji 5,600 dan, Xie Sheng 3,800 dan, Yong Chang 2,800 dan, De Ji 3,300 dan, Hong Chang 1,500 dan, Chang He 1,500 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Open Account Number</p>
<p>August 36.95 36.80 36.95 Rise 0.50 165,500</p>
<p>October 37.00 36.90 36.90 Rise 0.45 168,700</p>
<p>November 36.90 36.80 36.85 Rise 0.45 191,200</p>

<p>January 37.20 37.10 37.20 Rise 0.50 48,200</p>
<p>Total 713,500</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Procure Raw Cotton</p>
<p>In the spot cotton market, Japanese factories are selling more smoothly, while Chinese factories are experiencing slower sales.</p>

<h3>Flour and Wheat Advance and Retreat Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after demanding margin calls the day before and closing for a day, saw the market sentiment become good due to the worsening environment and positive external news. Before the opening, it was anticipated that prices would surely rise. When trading opened in the morning, prices had already risen by around 1.12 yuan due to the continued increases in Canadian and Chicago quotes over the past two days. Therefore, the current month's opening price was raised sharply to 0.66 yuan. Distant months also trended upward, but to a lesser extent, around 0.35 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the second session, buying interest from outside the trade remained strong, and buyers absorbed supplies at any cost. By the third session, prices for all months, near and distant, had risen sharply again by 0.1 to 0.123 yuan compared to Monday's market. Prices for November and beyond were all above the 0.9 jiao level, demonstrating the extent of speculative frenzy. When trading opened in the afternoon, sentiment remained high, and the current month rose to 0.885 yuan. This was a record unseen in three or four years. Opening prices for September and October also continued to be strong by 0.12 yuan. However, it was rumored that factories were collectively selling off to maintain prices. At the highest point, they indeed sold off aggressively. As a result, while opening prices for November were good, prices fell sharply step by step. The situations for December and January were similar. The market was overbought, and sensing a change in wind direction, sellers dumped their holdings at the second session's opening. The sharpness of the reversal was as grand as the upward surge. From then on, prices fell in all sessions, especially for November and beyond, with the decline being even sharper. The difference from the morning reached 0.15 yuan. As a result, the current month was still better by 0.03 yuan compared to before the suspension, September and October were better by 0.0025 yuan, November fell by 0.0325 yuan, December fell by 0.035 yuan, and January fell by 0.01 yuan. The exchange has increased margin requirements again, effective yesterday, to 750 yuan for both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, prices rose by around 1.12 yuan in Canadian and foreign wheat quotations over the past two days, leading to extremely strong sentiment. The opening price for the current month was 0.3 yuan, and September's was 0.4 yuan, an increase of around 0.17-0.18 yuan compared to before the suspension. However, in the current market, which has already entered a frenzy, this increase was not considered severe. However, after the second session, due to the continued wild increase in flour futures, the strength of buying interest was unparalleled. The current month rose to 0.42 yuan, September to 0.61 yuan, October to 0.73 yuan, and November/December to 0.73-0.74 yuan, an increase of 0.23-0.34 yuan compared to Monday's market. This kind of consecutive sharp rise was a first since the exchange was established. When trading opened in the afternoon, the current month continued to rise by 0.06-0.07 yuan initially. However, when the September opening price showed signs of weakness in flour futures, the opening prices for all months also fell. The current month fell to 0.3 yuan, and September fell to 0.44 yuan, with an average decline of 0.1-0.2234 yuan. However, prices were still higher compared to before the suspension. As a result, the current month rose by 0.2 yuan, September rose by 0.15 yuan, October rose by 0.08 yuan, November rose by 0.07 yuan, December rose by 0.06 yuan, and January rose by 0.16 yuan in the morning but fell back by the same amount in the afternoon. In the spot wheat market, with standard prices being high, sentiment was also good. High-quality wheat, such as that from Xuzhou, Shandong, was quoted at 4.4 yuan, while medium-quality wheat was quoted at around 2.3 yuan. A total of over 10,000 bags were opened. For inland packaged wheat, such as that from Suzhou, the asking price was already 7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Dealers Vigorously Purchase Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>North China Dealers Inquire About Jing Rice</p>
<p>The situation in the foreign rice market was initially strong, but due to sporadic arrivals in recent days, and with sudden rain in the city yesterday, sentiment turned downward, and market prices immediately fell. Slightly inferior Xiaojiao rice fell to 10.45 yuan. However, after the market price fell slightly, local buyers became greedy again, and with strong demand from inland areas, dealers from Jiangxi province became even more active. As soon as the market price fell, all parties competed to buy, and high-quality Xiaojiao rice rose sharply to 10.72 yuan, almost 1 jiao higher than the previous day. Other rice varieties showed little difference from previous market prices. However, new Hunan rough Jing rice opened at 8.4 yuan, Hankou rough rice opened at 8.5 yuan, while machine-milled Jing rice showed a slight decline, with prices opening at 11 yuan, and lower-quality varieties at 10.23 yuan. The total opening was 6,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, 200 bags of Saigon rice, 1,500 bags of various rough rice, and 1,300 bags of machine-milled Jing rice. The primary destination was the Jiujiang area. In addition to continued procurement by local inland dealers, there were also 246 bags of newly packaged Jing rice inquired about by northern dealers, with a price of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>River Barges Carrying Rice are Delayed by Wind</h3>
<p>Very Few Arrivals: Trade Also Quiet</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Due to wind and tides obstructing sources from various areas, only four or five barges arrived yesterday, carrying about six to seven hundred shi of goods. The local market was also at a standstill because of this, with only a few dealers absorbing supplies. A Qingdao dealer suddenly selected 700-800 bags of special goods such as Qing Si. Market conditions were unremarkable. New Geng rice still opened at 11.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Eight or nine barges arrived yesterday from various locations downriver. Sales of all goods were obstructed by wind and rain, and little trading took place. White Geng rice was slightly lower by 0.1-0.2 yuan, while the remaining goods were flat. However, Dongxin Geng rice remained firm.</p>
<h3>Soybean Price Increase Slows</h3>
<p>Raw Soybean Oil Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of rising soybean prices slowed down, mainly because of a decrease in downstream demand. A total of eleven or twelve cartloads of various soybeans were traded in the market, with sales mainly to small-scale local dealers. Factories were inactive, and prices rose by 0.15 yuan. Although telegrams reported higher prices in the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained subdued, leading to slightly hesitant sentiment. Only 160 bags of June white soybeans were traded, with prices rising by 0.3 yuan. Due to the intermittent supply of new soybeans from Jiujiang, holders of stored soybeans were waiting for higher prices. Therefore, there were no transactions, except for 60 bags re-sold by traders. City gate soybean prices opened at 4.4 yuan. The oil market differed from the soybean market due to rising production costs, interrupted supply, and relatively thin inventories. Therefore, market prices continued to rise. Soybean oil rose by 0.8 yuan, and peanut oil rose by 0.5 yuan. The future outlook is still strong.</p>
<p>Financial - Silver Price Increase Remains Strong</p>
<h3>Gold Price Falls Again by 4.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market has been trending downwards for several days. Yesterday, the silver price rose again, leading to a sharp decline in the gold market at the opening. However, buying interest was stronger after the decline, weakening the downward momentum and leading to a slight rebound. However, the situation remained uncertain throughout the morning, with supply and demand fluctuating, making it difficult to feel optimistic. At the opening, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both rose, and the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 0.06-0.072. London spot gold fell by 2.5 pence, and exchange rates all increased. American cotton rose by 10 pounds, and American wheat rose by 1.25. Stock prices fell slightly. According to reports, the domestic disaster situation was severe after President Roosevelt's inspection, and the government would sacrifice 500,000 yuan to provide relief. Given this situation, the US government would inevitably turn towards expansion to seek funds, causing alarm in the market. The opening price fell to 57-58 yuan. After opening, banks tended to bargain, and a sudden surge of bargain hunters caused prices to rise, but there was still a further decline. Once the HSBC bank's exchange rate was known to be 0.125 higher for the British pound and 0.375 higher for the US dollar, the momentum waned, as the settlement price was still more than 50 yuan away. With banks bargain-hunting, the exchange rate tightened, and buying interest became more active, breaking through the 60 yuan mark and rising. A settlement of funds from the British American Tobacco company further tightened the domestic market, boosting sentiment and pushing gold prices higher. However, after two instances of supply at high prices, the upward trend stopped, and sentiment became uneasy again. In addition, due to the sharp overnight declines for several days, the supply in the market increased, but downstream demand was limited. However, because banks still had an appetite and buyers continued to maintain support, prices were still able to rise, but ultimately lacked the power to surge. Therefore, short sellers did not become active, and the market situation appeared uncertain. The yarn market remained difficult to boost. Although prices rose, they could not sustain, but the downward trend also lacked power. The morning market showed a pattern of fluctuating. The price of pure gold was 973.3 yuan, with Tianjin goods about 15 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. The morning market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 958.3 yuan, a sharp decline of 7.5 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at the same price. The morning opening exchange rate for the near-term selling price was 1 shilling 4.5 pence for the British pound and 34.8125 yuan for the US dollar. Sumitomo paid 35.1875 yuan for the November US dollar. Yifeng, Yongcheng, Kangyuan, Maoyong, Fuxing, Yongtian, Fengyong, Yuanchang, Yongzhao, Fenghui, Xiangding, Kangzi increased from 8 yuan to 9.7 jiao, Yicheng, Bingxing, Fuyu sold strips, Mitsui came out at 9.375 yuan for the September US dollar, reduced to 8 yuan, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yingxiang, Yuqingyong had strong buying, rising to over 9 yuan. It was anticipated that the HSBC posted rates would be 0.125 higher for the British pound and 0.375 higher for the US dollar, which seemed insufficient, and sentiment improved. Yongli, Hongxing, Qianchang, Xiangding, Kangyifeng, Yongcheng, Kangshunmao all increased, breaking through the 60 yuan mark, rising to 61 yuan. Huixiang, Fuyu, Qianchang, Xiangcuitai, Yicheng took the opportunity to sell strips, and retreated to 59.2 jiao. Qianchang, Xiang, Yuqingyong, Yongcheng, Kangtian, Fengyuan, Maoyongyi, Fengyongfuxingyong, Tongtaichang, Dadechengyuanchun, Daxingyong, Hengxingyuan and others frantically bought, McGary raised the price of the November US dollar at 0.625, rising to 62.5 yuan. Although Dadecheng sold at 1.8 jiao, Tongtaichangyuanxingyiyu kept buying. HSBC raised the price of the December US dollar by 0.25, further rising to 3.3 yuan. Hongli, Hengtai, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yongli sold off in succession, and then retreated to 0.06 jiao. Dadecheng Yuanchun Zhentai took the opportunity to come in at low prices, McGary Shanghai raised the December US dollar price to 0.25, gradually rising to 2.8 jiao, Yifeng Yong Yongfeng, Dachangxiang, Tianfengyong Yuanchang Yong sold off, Citibank came out at 0.75 yuan for the August US dollar, reducing it to 1.6 jiao, Zhaofeng Chang Huiyuan Yiyu entered again, and added to 2.7 jiao, HSBC raised the price of the November US dollar at 35.125 yuan. Sentiment was still difficult to maintain, Yongli, Yifeng, Yonghuixiang, Chengkangfuxingyong, Tianfengyong sold off, and fell to within 1 yuan, Zhaofengchang Yiyu Yuqingyong took the opportunity to accept strips, rising to 2 yuan. Bingxing sold off, and the afternoon close was 961.7 yuan. Goods were priced at 3 yuan. After the market closed, Yiyu, Yuqingyong, Huixiangding, Kangfuan, Dadecheng, Qingfa, Yongfuan, Hengyu and others jointly entered strips, rising to 3.5 yuan. The highest price for the morning was 963.3 yuan, and the lowest was 958 yuan, a fluctuation of 5.3 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 4.1 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was 34.25 yuan due to the HSBC bank's US dollar listing increasing by 0.375, which corresponded to a gold price of 1,010 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 48 yuan lower, 7 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for the current month was 962 yuan, and for September was 962 yuan. The morning additional water payment was 962 yuan. The price of pure gold was 973.3 yuan. With the decline in gold prices, sales interest from dealers turned quiet, and there were no transactions. Although there was supply, it was to offset previous short positions. Tianjin goods were approximately 15-16 yuan higher, but there were no transactions, as buyers had no interest. The same was true for swapping. Although the atmosphere in the market was higher, short sellers generally did not want to pay the 2 yuan premium to long positions, so there was no activity. 28 August strips were transferred from Dadecheng to Huiyuan at 960 yuan. 77 public orders were received and settled today.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was chaotic. Overall, Shunli Tong Shi Chang Dingkang Dafayong Yifeng Yong Futaifeng Fuyu Yuqing Yong Hui Xiang Qian Chang Xiang Yong De Ding Tai Zhaofeng Chang Yuanchun Tongchun Heng Chang Yongyuanxing Hengxing Yiyu were on the buying side. Tianfeng Yong Bingxing Yuanyong Shen Kangsen Chang Yong Chang Sheng Yong Da Chang Xiang Hengtai Hongxing Dakang Yuanchang Yong Heng Yu Yongfeng were on the selling side. Hengxingyuan Yicheng Fuan Fuyu first sold and then bought, Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Qian Chang Xiang Cheng Kang first bought and then sold, Dalian Gang Shunli jointly did over 1,300 strips, and netted over 800 strips, Wanxing jointly did about 900, with a slight amount netted, Guang Gang Shengda was silent, Hengxing entered over 100 strips, and sold dozens of strips. The total number of transactions on the day was 53,711 strips.</p>

The sellers are Yingfengheng with over 3,300 strips, Qianchangxiang with over 500, Dafengheng and Dadecheng with over 2,000 each, and Tongfengheng with over 100 strips.

Then, the HSBC bank posting prices was revealed, with the British pound increasing by 0.125 and the US dollar by 0.375, which was not powerful. The mood was better, and the banks bargained again.

<h3>The Silver Dollar Market is Not Easy to Develop</h3>
<p>Recently, the silver and money industry, recognizing the sluggish market conditions, has been considering developing new avenues. Therefore, there have been some abnormal developments in the financial market lately. However, it is not known that once society goes bankrupt, the fundamentals of finance will be shaken. Even maintaining the status quo is difficult, let alone development. Therefore, the sudden increase in "drawing heads and adding water" the day before yesterday was like a flash in the pan. Yesterday, the market retreated to two cents again, which shows this. The interbank lending rate is still seven cents. There has been no progress in bill trading. The early market transfer and new transactions totaled over 3.6 million. The afternoon market transactions were over 300,000. Transactions in the small general meeting were over 200,000. The silver pledge transactions, including redemption and new transactions, totaled over 2.0 million. The bank's receipts and disbursements were no better or worse than before. Foreign banks received and disbursed over 2.4 million in bills, over 300,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and over 3.1 million in various goods and foreign exchange pledges and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements, with 500,000 leaving the warehouse. Chinese banks received and disbursed over 3.0 million in bills, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 600,000 in customs duties, and over 4.2 million in various goods and foreign exchange pledges and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements, with 300,000 entering the warehouse.

<h3>Subsidiary Coins Still Show No Improvement</h3>

Copper coins remained the same as the previous day at 332,500 wen, with a transaction price of 9,500 silver dollars, equivalent to 31,587 strings and 500 wen.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Hovers with a Slight Firming Trend</h3>
<p>The Ninety-Six Short Positions are Mostly Covered</p>
<p>Total Transaction Volume Exceeds Six Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange did not see much change in the market. However, the hovering trend seemed to have lessened slightly, and the trend was slightly improving. The thirty-eighth short position in the market gradually saw hedging. The large short position in Ninety-Six, amounting to several hundred thousand, was reportedly mostly covered one after another. The Fourth Issue saw slight buying, and the floating long positions on the trading floor decreased significantly. The existing retail long positions were also limited. The future prospects should be promising. The environment showed no cracks. The short positions had little hope of expiring. Once the swap trading started, the market price should rise. Yesterday's activity showed that the opening adjustment of troops was still a bad sign. Afterwards, it gradually stabilized and trended upward, slightly better by 5 cents to 2 jiao. The second session continued to trend upward, continuing better by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Among them, only the Sixth Issue was slightly down by 5 fen. The trading on the floor was still flat. The resulting market prices generally rose by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 4 jiao, 5 jiao per yuan, with a total transaction volume of 6,296,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan of spot long positions. The resulting rise, fall, high, and low prices are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Items Rise Exclusively</h3>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported yesterday (7th) that the New York Stock Exchange market was still sluggish, and railway stocks were particularly weak. This was because the drought caused agricultural losses of 500 million yuan, and railway operations would also suffer significant losses. Afterwards, due to the rise in miscellaneous grains and the rumors of expansion in gold and silver stocks, the market rebounded, and market conditions stabilized. The General Motors Corporation's dividend distribution also had a positive impact on the market. The stocks on the small exchange were mixed. The bond market fell due to rumors of expansion and drought losses. The weather was also dry, and miscellaneous grains soared. Corn created a new peak in recent years. Later, due to a large number of profit-taking by bulls, prices rose and then fell. As a result, the Eastern and local gangs absorbed the stock, and the overseas market was strong, so it still rose several points compared to the previous day. The price of New York bar silver was 47.375 cents, the highest in five years. The total volume of the day was 610,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>6th　7th　Rise/Fall</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks　88.11　87.47　Down 0.64</p>

<h3>The Price of Glutinous Rice Branches in the North-South Goods Market Drops by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>(Glutinous Rice Branches) After the opening price fell, it was 15-16 yuan lower than the initial market. Therefore, the market price was also difficult to stabilize. Only 138 packages were sold in yesterday's market, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous market. (Haikou Branches) Because there were more arrivals this time, and the existing stock had not yet been sold through, the negotiated price the day before yesterday had a widening gap between the two sides, so no agreement was reached. It is still undecided yesterday, and they are still in stalemate.</p>
<h3>The Price of Dried Lily Flowers is Relaxing</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of dried lily flowers has gradually increased, but sales have been slow. Therefore, the market price has shown a relaxing trend. For example, the price of high-quality goods is currently around 15 yuan, and the local price has also turned down. There are about 500 packages of unsold inventory. The inventory of goods in the market is relatively large. Judging from the recent sporadic sales, it will not be easy to rebound for a while. Compared with the previous market price, it has already dropped by 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Price of Brown and White Sugar Made in China Rises by 1-2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw no rise or fall in customs gold, and the trend was flat. The guild's quoted price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot was still 19.9 yuan. Transshipment goods were 6.5 yuan. Dutch red KNG mark was quoted at 15.45 yuan. Taikoo B mark white sugar was 10.3 yuan, slightly discounted. CW mark was quoted at 20.005 yuan. DY mark was 19.85 yuan. The local factory's fine white Zhenyu No. 1 was 18.9 yuan. The price of green sugar from Tiezhuang continued to be tight, opening at 14.5 yuan, up by 2 jiao. Huanggang green sugar was 13.8 to 13.5 yuan, with a total transaction of over 300 packages. Over 100 packages of high-quality Hainan red sugar opened at 13.4 to 13.35 yuan. Ordinary oil packages opened at 500 packages at 12.8 yuan, all rising by a few cents. Over 100 packages of Nali white sugar from the Guangdong gang opened at 19.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Textiles</p>
<h3>Autumn Market for Woolen Fabrics and Broadcloth Has Opened</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric industry officially opens its prices, which are divided into two periods: the New Year's red market and the autumn market. Yesterday's autumn market for woolen fabrics seemed more balanced than in previous years. 1005 riding breeches opened at 8.25 yuan. Herringbone yarn low-grade autumn overcoat fabric was 3.75 yuan. 42,000 flower tweed was 6.25 yuan. Checkered tweed was 5 yuan. The prices were all very balanced. It is said that the Sichuan-North gang has a good performance.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Tea Sales Are Stagnant and Prices Are Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in Shanghai was increasingly sluggish. All kinds of black and green tea in the city, except for the refined Zhenmei, were slightly smoother, and the rest were sluggish. It is found that the Moroccan market has not yet relaxed its demand for Chinese tea. The reason for the sluggish sales is actually due to the high opening price, the rapid price drop, and the excessive chaos in the market. Recently, various black and green teas have been sold individually by Chinese merchants, falling again and again, creating a situation of falling without rising. General experts understand this situation, and their attitude is becoming more and more wait-and-see. Judging from the current market situation, it seems difficult to reverse the decline without stabilizing the goods price.</p>
<h3>Spot Silk Sales Are Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic and foreign silk sales in Shanghai were increasingly calm. Because the government has determined the method of assisting the silk industry, silk manufacturers are unwilling to sell their silk at a loss, and the market is increasingly quiet. Yesterday, Yin Zhuang entered 23 packages of yellow-white coarse silk, and the price was still flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk is Selling at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>The prices of artificial silk for each seasonal goods have slightly softened, so transactions have improved. Yesterday, many silk factories started to purchase. Italian goods No. 150 and No. 120 both had transactions. No. 100, because it has been in the warehouse for a long time, the foreign firms are willing to sell it at a reduced price. However, the Shandong gang, which is known for its strong sales, has recently been sluggish.</p>

<p>Supplement to Shen Bao This City</p>
<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Banning Inferior Private Schools</h3>
<p>— OH</p>
<p>The pretext is "rectifying education," which no one dares to question and is undeniable!</p>
<p>However, we must admit that "the existence of a fact is never accidental." It has its own "social background"! Then, we cannot regard the "banning of private schools" as an isolated issue. At the very least, before banning private schools, we must first examine the reasons why private schools can exist in society, and then investigate them, so that it will not become a "stopgap"!</p>
<p>These two days, opening the newspaper is indeed dazzling, with recruitment ads everywhere. Some even use the tactics of commercial advertising, such as XX School's "few places left, register quickly," and other schools' beautiful sentences, such as "our school has fresh air and convenient transportation," "complete equipment," and so on, all of which are "luring customers," and are completely "commercialized"! As for the government-run schools? Although there are sometimes advertisements in the newspaper, stating when the school will enroll, but on the day of the exam, the required number can only be a fraction of the number of applicants. Of course, many students fail!</p>
<p>Where do these failed students go? That is the reason for the development of private schools. Many failed students, as long as they have the ability to study, have to enter a school (in the ordinary mentality, having attended a school means having received education, and it is also easier to find a job!). But the number of government-run places is limited, so they have to see those tempting advertisements in the newspapers and invest in that kind of school!</p>
<p>But, this is only part of the reason. At the same time, there is also a class of "people who use reading as a cover." In the minds of these people, reading is just a necessary procedure at the moment, and they will not rely on reading to eat in the future. Therefore, they don't need to pay attention to their studies. Fortunately, they only regard it as a cover. It seems a bit out of place if they don't read, and it doesn't sound good in society. Do these people go to strict schools? Too hard, not used to it. Therefore, "take off your pants to fart" type of private schools are very suitable for their taste.</p>
<p>However, "private schools" are not necessarily worse than "government-run" schools. Many "private schools" have more generous funding than "government-run" schools, but only a very small number. At the same time, the students in government-run schools are not all diligent students. In this modern age of deception, it is difficult to avoid it in the education field. There are some people with real talent and learning who cannot get into XX school, but those who have a nominal school status and know the school directors or the principal's relatives can enter with their heads held high, which prevents genuine students from "not being able to enter the door, or those who can enter are few," isn't it too unfair?</p>
<p>Finally, before the Ministry of Education bans inferior private schools, it is hoped that it can actively create several perfect schools. Otherwise, simply "banning" without "building" is not a good policy. No matter what, you must open a path for people to walk on before you can ban the path of inferior thorns! But construction is not a simple problem. If we want to build, we must build thoroughly, not construction that recycles old goods. The current banning of inferior private schools is only eliminating the bad ones, but simply destroying the bad ones is not enough. We must also build good schools! To build good schools, we must first concretely recognize society and reform it correctly. Otherwise, if education and society are irrelevant, it will lose the original purpose of running education.</p>
<h3>Date After Dusk</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The sun is still hanging high in the sky.</p>
<p>Li Da's heart is burning like fire. As soon as he finishes hoeing to the end of a field ridge, he raises his head to look at the sky, to look at the sun. His thoughts are also unsettled. As soon as he thinks of that round face and plump arms, his hands are so soft, and his eyes are so flowery, it's as if he has a charming girl like A Jin in front of him. He reaches out his hand, but damn it, he touches nothing.</p>
<p>He holds the rake in his hand, lazily hoeing, hoeing. The clods of dirt jump, and his heart also jumps. He raises his head again to look at the sun, that cumbersome thing that seems to be nailed to the sky. Usually, the daylight is very short, and the sun rolls down the mountain as soon as it comes out. Today, it's awkward and won't roll down for a long time. He feels like jumping into the sky to pick it down in a rage.</p>
<p>He really can't focus.</p>
<p>……"Wait for me in the cypress tree grave at dusk." Li Da remembers this sentence firmly, this sentence that was said with enthusiasm and a shy expression. This morning, he met A Jin by the oxcart shed. She only said one sentence to him, and her cheeks turned red, and the blood seemed to be about to spurt from her fingertips.</p>
<p>"Damn it, who can I talk to about my troubles?" At this time, Li Da only hopes that it will be night, only hopes that dusk will come quickly. He longs for the loveliness of dusk.</p>
<p>When he is lost in thought, he puts down the rake, sits on the mound, and stares blankly. Sometimes he says to himself in his heart: "I'm so old, and I haven't married a wife yet. Last year was a good year, and I was thinking of getting engaged, but the market outside is bad, and the imported rice and wheat have lowered the price of food. What with the winter defense donation, the security donation, and the highway fee, you have to spend money horizontally, and you have to spend money vertically. Looking at it, Li Da is bound to be a bachelor for life."</p>
<p>Being a bachelor for life is not just empty talk. There are many middle-aged men in the countryside who haven't married a wife. They don't have money. It's not easy to raise one child with this situation. But those with family wealth have several women, concubines. Damn it, shameless girls all run after those with money, eating oil, wearing silk, enjoying happiness, letting their bodies be swallowed by toads, being a dog to relieve boredom for others, spineless!</p>
<p>But, there are also those who are fierce.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Take A Jin, she can be counted as one if she stretches out her fingers. She hasn't been caught by her cousin's hook several times. She doesn't love the shiny foreign money, she doesn't love eating well, she doesn't envy others' happiness. She has said:</p>
<p>"Cows in the countryside have to be slaughtered and used as food when they get to the city, and their milk is squeezed out to be used as a tonic for those with money. Girls are not much different from cows. Why think about the city? Isn't it good to live in the countryside? Do some work and eat, who says it's not good!"</p>
<p>When the sun rolls to the edge of the mountain hollow, Li Da jumps up from the mound. He remembers A Jin's unexpected deep affection for himself. His steps also become lighter. He carries the rake on his shoulder, returns home, washes his feet hastily, and eats two bowls of wheat porridge. His father tells him to twist hemp rope, but he ignores him and sneaks away.</p>
<p>He opens his eyes wide and squats alone in the cypress tree grave. Grains of starlight flicker in the village. The moon rolls into the sky from the west. In the distance, a black shadow is walking on the high levee, getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>"A Jin!"</p>
<p>"Who is A Jin, little devil, hiding and not doing anything good."</p>
<p>"Oh! Little Yinmei, I'll catch a firefly for you to play with."</p>
<p>"Do you think I care about you catching one?"……</p>
<p>Little Yinmei walks into the village. Li Da wipes away a handful of sweat and turns his gaze to the high levee again, waiting……</p>
<p>His heart is constantly chanting, "Dusk, oh! Dusk!"……</p>
<h3>Common Ailments of Women</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Times have finally evolved. Chinese women, who have always been locked in their boudoirs, seem to be another kind of human species, having no opportunity to meet men in society and careers. Thus, a Daiyu-style of beauty has been formed. The fact tells us that in the past, Chinese women were for men to vent their lust, to pass on their genes, and nothing more. However, times have finally evolved. After the 1911 Revolution, Chinese women have raised the banner of confronting men. Year after year, after more than twenty years of shouting, women seem to have formed a lineup. Look, there are female committee members, female county magistrates, female secretaries, female adjutants, female police officers, which line doesn't have them?</p>
<p>Yes, this is a sign of the evolution of the times! This is the gospel of the evolution of women! The glory of the extension of women's rights! How worthy it is for us to praise!</p>
<p>However, regrettably, the fact is so distorted! Although there are female committee members, female county magistrates, etc., they are just a little embellishment in the long history, a kind of insignificant personal development, which has not established a role model for the entire women's community. In other words, most women today have not broken free from the old shackles of the past, but have only added a new layer of powder on the surface. Although it seems that there has been great progress, the bone marrow is still the same.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the current women's pathology, that is, the mistakes, is actually more serious than before. Just looking at the number of disputes caused by women, one can imagine the general situation. Such facts occupy large areas of newspapers every day, and they are all eye-catching. There is no need to list them in detail.</p>
<p>Let's analyze it and see.</p>
<p>(1) The Rising of Vanity丨丨In the past, Chinese women, although they were appendages of men, did not have much vanity. The so-called "marry a chicken follow a chicken, marry a dog follow a dog" is truly a vivid portrayal. They had nothing but to rely on heaven for food and to rely on heaven to arrange their lives. Now it's different. The most obvious is the rising of vanity. No matter what they do, they only seek the satisfaction of vanity, and they can ignore everything else. For example, during the study period, nine out of ten female students are slaves to grades, desperately fighting with teachers. As long as the grades are the highest, the actual knowledge is not in their mind. Participating in sports is also for the cheers of the audience. After leaving school, doing a wife must also ask whether there is family wealth and whether there is power. All of this is caused by vanity.</p>
<p>(2) The Preservation of Slave Mentality丨丨Although it is said that now it is equal between men and women, and men and women serve in society equally. However, because of the rising of their vanity, they are ultimately unable to open up an independent path and establish an independent personality. Therefore, we will not go into the period of studying or being in the boudoir. Once they graduate and marry a man, they fully reveal their slave mentality. They originally regarded marriage as a career, and they solved their material and spiritual lives through marriage. Therefore, the life of a modern woman ends as soon as she gets married. They only know how to act coquettishly and flatter in front of their husbands in order to win their favor. Everything else can be ignored. This kind of performance of slave mentality is really the only fatal injury to women's movement.</p>
<p>(3) The Desire for Enjoyment is Very Strong丨丨According to the first mistake, because vanity is very heavy, and they only know how to be "parasites," they can't talk about production themselves. Of course, they only know how to enjoy. It's okay to enjoy, but they also have a very strong desire, blindly rushing towards the "happiness" side, fully exposing the symptoms of women. If this continues, how can they not fall into a trap and be trampled on? How can they not also ruin their own personality? Destroy the development of women's movement?</p>
<p>Women, the times tell us that this is definitely not your way out. Wake up!</p>

<h3>Night Scene on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The curtain of night has already descended upon the world: the late summer evening breeze has brought a gentle coolness. The electric street lamps suddenly shine brightly, and the neon lights spew out their red flames. It is as if a golden serpent of ten thousand rays of light is dancing in the air, illuminating the street corners as if it were daytime. People and cars are interwoven in the streets, women holding onto men, men chasing after women, surging,澎湃, and激盪 in the roads like an angry tide.</p>
<p>Beside the Huangpu River, the great bell of the Jianghai Customs House stands tall in the sky: it seems not to feel the dreadfulness of the summer sun or the winter northwest wind! It diligently performs its duty of telling time day and night. The god of peace stands alone by the river, shedding tears!</p>
<p>Along the road, scattered among the trees, are dotted dim lights: the river breeze strikes people's faces, bringing a slight warmth. Every tram is packed full, and the convertibles are running at full throttle, racing each other on the road like flying. The docks of the city ferries are crowded with people, men and women; the sound of coins at the ticket booths jingles. "Toot! Toot!" With two blasts of the whistle, the ship leaves the dock, taking a boatload of people enjoying the cool lake breeze, rushing towards Wusong against the waves. A crowd of people is left behind, forced to stare enviously as it gradually disappears into the starry, misty waves.</p>
<p>The evening tide rises into the Huangpu River, the waves striking the shore, emitting a clear crashing sound, like the weeping of women or the groaning of patients; so bleak, so cold!</p>
<p>Looking across the river, the scattered lights are truly as beautiful and serene as the stars in the night sky. However, some shadows of constructions are faintly visible, the only aggressive weapons of a few imperialists! Warships! Standing silently in the heart of the river.</p>
<p>On the lawn by the river, many toiling masses, driven out of their houses by the heat, lie in rows like wounded soldiers after a defeat. In their eyes, perhaps, this is a summer resort just like Lushan or Moganshan.</p>
<p>Groups of people flow into the gate of the Bund Park: there is no longer a single empty spot on the chairs or the grass. Under the shelter of the trees, couples are cuddling and embracing: in the center of the park,藤 tables and chairs selling cold drinks are full. The radio plays exotic tunes. Sailors with loose morals, arm in arm with "salty water girls," stagger through the pedestrians, humming lion-like tunes, a strange-smelling alcoholic stench making people want to vomit. People avoid them from afar, but their greedy eyes are fixed on the beautiful Chinese women.</p>
<p>On the grass, in the shadows of the lights, lay stretched out | quite a few people, each with a woman sitting beside them, whispering something?</p>
<p>There are also many small comedies of romance being played out there, perhaps, I conjecture.</p>
<p>A crescent moon, incomplete and not perfectly round, shyly reveals a face like a virgin from the horizon, gradually rising into the sky, scattering ten thousand rays of silver light, illuminating the turbid Huangpu River as if it were filled with mercury. Beautiful ripples, swaying with the wind, the clear brilliance, permeate everyone's heart, arousing boundless, unimaginable fantasies.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The three characters (天曉得) "Tian Xiao De" [God Knows] have long been a commonplace expression in the mouths of Chinese people. Its meaning is very clear, but its origin is untraceable. My friend (?) Hu Shi is far away in Beiping; otherwise, I would have called on him to humbly ask him about it, and writing about it would have been "精" (refined) and "采" (brilliant), much more valuable. But the topic has been set, and the goods must be delivered to paper. I cannot wait, so I can only talk about it "朦朧" (vaguely). Fortunately, its meaning is clear, and readers are mostly wise, so it is not difficult to understand. "Tian Xiao De" is similar to "莫明其妙" [inexplicable]. This is considered the foreword.</p>
<p>Yesterday, colleague X, who is in charge of academic affairs, said to me: "The level of the students here is truly laughable. A high school graduate came to collect his certificate, and when I handed it over, I asked him to provide a simple receipt. He actually said he didn't know how to write it and asked me to do it for him..."</p>
<p>On the other hand, since the summer vacation, most of the graduates from various schools in Beiping have had no way out, so they initiated a career movement, followed by Nanjing Zhongda and this local Jinda. I have paid special attention to the occurrence of this movement from the beginning. It still seems to be just a lot of shouting with no results. University graduates are not easily cultivated? Logically, they should be the most useful and highest-level talents, but in fact, they are busy shouting about finding a way out, which is truly bewildering and maddening to see.</p>
<p>The performance of this matter is a general liquidation of the bankruptcy of Chinese education, and it is also a sign that society has reached an extreme state of decline. Apart from repeatedly calling out "Tian Xiao De," I really have nothing else to say.</p>
<p>There are especially many things worth noting in Shanghai society, especially in such a hot season. Every morning, when I open the newspaper and look at the social news section, I always find one or two shocking miracles. To put it bluntly, if you go to the streets for sightseeing, you will constantly see things that will break your heart. If you don't believe me, listen to what I have to say:</p>
<p>In the evening, the girls from poor families escape the sweltering attics or small rooms, thinking of going to the alley entrance to breathe in some cooler air. They shouldn't have to worry about the precept of "a son of a thousand gold does not sit under a leaning eaves," but even then, unexpected disasters can fly in from nowhere. There are some wretched people who don't care if your age is only five or six years old, let alone whether you are fully grown. As long as they have the opportunity 丨丨 no one is around, and they see you alone, they will look to you for a place to vent their sexual urges. Thus, the news of the rape of a X-year-old girl and the conviction is produced.</p>
<p>On hot days, the cold drink business is ten times more profitable. Ice cream, shaved ice, all kinds of soda, one bottle after another is sent to the mouths of the rich. But on the streets, there are many coolies picking up watermelon rinds (please note, really watermelon rinds!) that others have eaten and discarded on the ground, biting them piece by piece, as if the coolness is refreshing and can fill their stomachs, with endless flavor. Sometimes, three or five of them are fighting over them, causing a big commotion.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers, bare-shouldered and barefoot, are willing to pull people at low prices under the fiery sun to earn a living. The people in the rickshaws, wearing cicada-wing-like silk and gauze clothes, holding umbrellas above their heads, and waving fans in their hands, "Hot, hot, the third one is deadly hot," quietly and elegantly comes out of their mouths.</p>
<p>In the Zhabei Dayang Bridge Tanzhiwan area, after nightfall, it is like a "nudist colony." Children, needless to say, are all stark naked, and even adult men and women are mostly unclothed. The roadside is their natural large bed. As a result, diseases occur frequently, and no one has money to deal with them, so deaths follow one after another, but the wealthy turn a deaf ear.</p>
<p>These, these, are all considered "Tian Xiao De."</p>

<h3>Random Words During Illness</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>It is painful when a person is heartbroken, it is painful when a person is frustrated, it is painful in a life environment that is neither alive nor dead, it is painful when a person is sick, and it is even more painful when a person is sick alone and has no friends, relatives, or loved ones to take care of and comfort them; this pain is deeply engraved in my mind, in my heart, in the flow of my blood!</p>
<p>This pain is a kind of helpless and unsupported pain, a kind of cruel pain, a kind of great pain without emotion! From these pains, I have experienced many lessons and the essence of life. From these pains, I have learned many valuable ways of being a person!</p>
<p>For my own lonely sorrow, I once stirred up a thread of sadness. In the silent night, I used my weak elbow to support my head, which was causing mental pain due to anxious thinking. Under the dim light of the lamp in the room, I held a sorrowful mood and, with a tragic attitude, gazed out with my tearful eyes. Outside the window, it was also dim, bleak, and dull, a gray night! As if it were the same as my mood.</p>
<p>Although the sky was full of stars, accompanied by a crescent moon like an eyebrow, this scenery, not only would not arouse my admiration, but, for a person who is being entangled by illness and fighting against loneliness, how unfortunate this is!</p>
<p>The change in a person's consciousness caused by the pain of illness is terrible, dangerous, and may even lead me to a path of destruction in helplessness!</p>
<p>At this time, a thought of suicide suddenly surged in my heart. I felt that it was better to die than to suffer this unbearable pain for living in vain! Isn't death the end of all suffering?</p>
<p>Is it absolutely unacceptable to wait for death with eyes wide open, to let the disease arbitrarily go wild on one's body, trampling and ravaging it? Although my body cannot resist it at this time, my spirit must fight it desperately.</p>
<p>Death is absolutely unavoidable. Yes, I would rather end my life quickly. After all, there is no good in living like that.</p>
<p>I feel that I don't need people's help anymore. Because I understand that behind the assistance lies a kind of despicable attempt. Therefore, it is better not to seek help from anyone!</p>
<p>As for pity, it is an insult to me, I do not accept anyone's pity. Sincere comfort is certainly a noble sympathy, but this sympathy is not easily revealed. But those false exhortations, fake enthusiasm, perfunctory attitude, I plug my ears, close my eyes, I hate those hypocritical guys!</p>
<p>In illness, I truly understand the truth and falsehood of friends and feelings, the happiness of health, and the taste of pain.</p>
<p>In illness, I have experienced people's deception, people's indifference, people's cruelty, human selfishness, human violence, human meanness, human wildness...</p>
<p>In illness, I feel how boring and base humans are! Allowing pain and disaster to eat away at a life that could be saved, this cannot but be said to be human unreasonableness and brutality.</p>

<h3>Temperament Change</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor!</p>
<p>I have a friend who told me about something difficult and needs to solve, but with my limited knowledge, how can I solve this difficult thing! So I ask for your help.</p>
<p>This friend of mine is now 23 years old. When he was fifteen years old, he gave up school to work. Because of his good character and careful work, he was appreciated by his teacher. After two years of observation, in 1928, he was introduced by his teacher to get engaged. The girl he is engaged to is the daughter of his teacher's wife's sister. The two sides often interact, and everyone is familiar. This girl often goes to their house, sometimes staying overnight or for a few days. In this transitional era, this marriage is very good, but recently, according to my friend, this girl has disappointed him very much. I asked him, how do you know? He said: "During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, she stayed in my house for several days. Because we lived together every day, it was easy to observe her. Her temper is extremely bad, she is very stingy and not generous! She is also lazy by nature and does not know how to cherish herself. My family also despises her (because she has done indecent things). If I marry her, not only will there be no love, but the relationship between the two sides will be bad. What's the point? And the family relationship will also break down, so my friend is very worried and spends his days in a city of sorrow. Now, I would like to propose two questions and ask you to answer them: 1. If he doesn't want to marry her, of course, he will break the engagement. What steps should he take? What methods are needed? What if she doesn't want to? 2. If he doesn't break the engagement with her, what methods can he take to change her temper and make her a good person? The above two questions urgently need your help to solve them. Wishing you good health. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Answer: Since your friend now has such a bad impression of the other party, it is of course better to break the engagement. The method of breaking the engagement is very simple: he can directly express it to the other party, or have the original matchmaker convey his intention to break the engagement. Now the effect of marriage contracts is very weak. If his will is very firm, the other party cannot force him, but the other party can ask him for compensation for damages. The second point, what methods can be used to make her temper better, this question is very difficult to answer. Because a person's temperament and character are not necessarily innate, but mainly cultivated by the environment, but once cultivated, it is very difficult to reform. As the saying goes, "It is easy to change mountains and rivers, but difficult to change one's nature." But temper is not impossible to change, and a person is not unable to become "good." In my opinion, your friend's fiancée's bad temper and character are probably due to poor education and lack of knowledge. Therefore, if he wants to hope that she becomes a "good person," he may as well start with education and try.</p>

<h3>The Idiot (2)</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>The children surrounded him, playing with him like playing with a monkey in a monkey show troupe: some picked up stones from the roadside and threw them at him: some used the roasted beans their mothers gave them to tease him: several children whose fathers owned small sundries shops took out slippery dried jujube pits from their mouths and hit him. They stamped their small feet, hummed with their small mouths, made gestures, and chanted in unison, issuing sarcasm like raindrops in a heavy rain:</p>
<p>"Idiot, do you want a wife?"</p>
<p>"Do you want a细毛相的 (fine-haired) girl, idiot?"</p>
<p>"Plum blossom pattern, bamboo tube legs, so beautiful! Do you want it?"</p>
<p>His round face, floating with the helpless sorrow of the oppressed, immediately flashed with a glimmer of hope, and he uttered a semi-believing echo from between his thick, clumsy lips:</p>
<p>"Of course I want a wife. Really? Where is she? Take me to see her, go, go!"</p>
<p>The children laughed so hard they couldn't catch their breath, bending over as if they had a stomachache.</p>
<p>"Here, it's him! Take it to the wedding!" pointing to a dog by the roadside.</p>
<p>Then disappointment, sorrow, and anger intertwined on his hairy face, and his lips moved constantly, obviously chewing on the taste of "bitterness."</p>
<p>However, just as all idiots who are accustomed to being trampled on and played with sometimes force smart people to temporarily hide their fierce faces behind gentle and amiable smiles, hidden in small favors like arsenic pills wrapped in white sugar, and that is for the purpose of trampling on them and playing with them even more cruelly. Our idiot also has times when he is seemingly fragrant on the surface, times when he can obtain food that he cannot beg for without having to beg, and times when children dare not play with him under the reprimands of adults, but the price he pays for accepting this unconventional treatment is naturally not just a few non-itchy, non-painful scoldings and laughter, or even a few small slaps that only give a momentary small pain.</p>
<p>Whenever the sky hangs with a misty rain net, and small puddles are dotted on the road, all the women who have no men, or whose men cannot carry water or are lazy to carry water in the rain, think of the idiot in unison. They first scrape their respective water tanks clean, and some,嫌 (disliking) that the water tanks are too small, also prepare an empty tank. Then they lean on the楼 (multi-storied) windows facing the street, or stand upright at the gate, listening intently to the idiot's call, like waiting for honored guests who bring 声香 (prestige and fortune).</p>

<h3>On Anti-War Films and Their Stance</h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>If we are not blind, if we do not want to be submissive people of imperialism, the current frenzy of imperialist war preparations has reached a point of madness, and we should not dare to ignore it.</p>
<p>Regarding the facts of this matter, there are almost countless examples. The US Navy's joint maneuvers in the Pacific and Atlantic, Britain's desperate expansion of its navy, France's unprecedented increase in military spending, Italy's construction of many warships of more than 30,000 tons and the distant expeditions of aircraft with iron wings covering the sky, Germany's Hitler's insistence on military equality and the expansion of his secret infantry, Japan's active invasion of North China and its constant challenges to the Soviet Union... Are these facts not enough to illustrate the mad war preparations of imperialism?</p>
<p>Recently, due to the death of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, the sharp opposition between the Versailles system and the anti-Versailles system has further become a direct conflict. Italy has even threatened to intervene with force, and France has disapproved of Papen as ambassador to Austria. Such facts show that the outbreak of war is possible at any time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, due to the rapid advancement of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, contrasted with the European and American countries' transition from relative stability after the war to the final stage of collapse, the doors of war and revolution are approaching: the opposition between the two worlds has promoted the active offensive against the Soviet Union by the East and the West. Britain has replaced France as the organizer of Poland, Romania, and other vassal states. The German Foreign Minister publicly declared the division of the Soviet Union. Japan's active espionage war on the northeastern border indicates the active growth of a new crusade. But until now, no military action has been launched. On the one hand, it is indeed because the fundamental contradictions between imperialists are difficult to eliminate, and on the other hand, the internal unrest of various countries and the growth of revolutionary forces are also the main reasons. Now it is a new cycle of war and revolution. It is an inevitable trend to eliminate imperialist war with revolutionary war.</p>
<p>Then, in this night of storms, what is reflected in the films? In Germany, in Japan, in Italy, because Fascism itself is the cause of war, we see that they are using films to organize war and welcome war. Similarly, in the United States, it is no exception. From many newsreels and from many films with war as the subject matter, we can even see the filmmakers' fanaticism for war.</p>
<p>However, in order to uphold world peace, especially in semi-colonial China, in order not to let China become the battlefield of the Second World War, in order to ensure that we do not die under poisonous gas bombs and become cannon fodder for imperialism, we must use all our strength to oppose the great war. Therefore, we must fulfill our mission in the film and produce anti-war films.</p>
<p>Naturally, what we require is not only anti-war films with a humanitarian aversion to war, but also a further step. We must correctly analyze the nature of the great war and explain the causes and consequences of the imperialist war. Moreover, in China, the production of anti-war films must not conflict with the launch of anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese films. We oppose imperialist wars, but we must have a large number of films that organize anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese national revolutionary wars. To be precise, only by launching a national war can we eliminate imperialist war and achieve a victorious future for China.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "It Happened One Night"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Ｈeads　We　Go！丨Cathay</p>
<p>The so-called twists and turns of the plot occupy a very important position in the beliefs of European and American filmmakers, which is an undeniable fact. Because of this, screenwriters have to open their minds to create some bizarre stories, and the question of whether they make sense is something they don't have to worry about.</p>
<p>"It Happened One Night" is a film that was reluctantly made under such circumstances. The irrationality of the plot is not only that the young woman Pei Di impersonates the star Tao Leshan Kai because of her similar appearance, which we dare not believe, but also that when the agent of the real Tao Leshan Kai encounters the fake Tao Lesai Kai on the cruise, he only needs to announce it publicly and the secret will be revealed immediately. And it is also unlikely that the young master will dress up as a waiter or ticket inspector.</p>
<p>Since the story is so illogical, then it is obvious that it does not represent reality. And how do the playwrights serve their class in the middle of this? Pei Di, a young lady from a modest family, meets a young master by chance, and they immediately fall in love within three minutes. And under the theme of instigating them to climb up, she is unhappy when she sees him turn into a waiter, but she suddenly becomes happy when he turns into the host of a feast on a cruise, and she is surprised again when he turns into a ticket inspector on the train. In the end, she finally realizes that he is indeed the son of a news tycoon, so she and he truly (?) fall in love. 丨丨The whole thing is a distorted and clumsy sermon.</p>
<p>Of course, with such a script, no matter how clever the director is, there will be no good results, let alone that the director Monty Banks cannot achieve a certain degree of success in form very cleverly. Compared to the director Frank Capra of "One Night of Passion," who can act as a liar and make people almost believe the absurd story, the director of "It Happened One Night" is far behind.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that there is nothing terribly wrong here. He always fulfills his responsibilities based on the illogical story, but some scenes are filmed as silent films and then dubbed with music, and even the applause that should be on the screen or the voices of people talking in the dance hall are gone. Secondly, the pretentious gags are also annoying to us.</p>
<p>The actress Constance Bennett's acting skills are not very good, although she plays two roles at the same time and grasps the two personalities.</p>
<p>The rest are all average.</p>
<h3>"Judging People by Appearances Lost Ziyu" Helen Hayes's Debut</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>In the past, movie stars relied on "beauty salons" for survival. But in today's film industry, beauty of appearance is no longer so rare. More important than beauty of appearance are voice and expression. This is probably a change brought about by the transition from silent films to sound films.</p>
<p>Looking at today's general big stars, with a few exceptions, they are not very beautiful. Not only are their faces ordinary, but many are even below ordinary. However, they possess lively and stylish postures, enough to be a modern star.</p>
<p>Helen Hayes is a pioneer among this type of actor. She does not have beautiful looks. She has also never studied embellishment. She succeeded as a modern big star entirely because she has superb artistic skills.</p>
<p>When Helen Hayes first arrived in Hollywood, after several auditions, the directors and cameramen, seeing her thin face and dull eyes, did not get any impression of female beauty. Her first film was stopped after only half of it was shot. She went through several attempts to join companies, all ending in failure. Finally, she switched to MGM. When she was auditioning at the MGM studio, the director and cameraman secretly shook their heads.</p>
<p>"She's probably going to scare away the audience in the theater." MGM's general manager, Irving Thalberg, said to chief director Edgar Selwyn. Selwyn quietly looked at her for a long time, feeling that she lacked a glamorous appearance and was not suitable as a film actor. So he suggested to Thalberg to try her out again at his home.</p>
<p>After Selwyn set up an audition room, he said to Thalberg, "Please close your eyes and listen to her audition with your ears." Thalberg closed his eyes, and he listened quietly to Helen's audition, which had already begun. Her dialogue, trembling voice, and emotionally moving tone, as well as many touching endings, made people's minds stir.</p>
<p>Thalberg opened his eyes, and tears had dripped from his eyes. He looked at Helen, forgetting her ordinary appearance, and felt that she was a very touching woman. From then on, Helen was chosen as a rare talent and became the protagonist of many famous films. The Academy Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1932 also went to her. Her face is not beautiful, but her status is extremely high!</p>
<h3>A Collection of New Information about "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Regarding director Hale's remarks after "The Good Earth" photography team returned to the United States, this publication has already reported to readers. What is reported here are some other new news about "The Good Earth."</p>
<p>Although it has been several weeks since "The Good Earth" photography team left China and returned to the United States, the two issues of actors and dialogue have not been resolved until now.</p>
<p>Although director George Hale shot a lot of location shots in China, the list of actors has not been finalized until now. He has already examined Chinese actresses and American stars on the spot, but for several weeks, this problem has not been solved.</p>
<p>American movie fans unanimously say that Chinese people cannot express the emotions of the characters in the play on the screen, but Hale saw the expressions of Chinese actors on the screen in China, including what he examined, and has completely expressed that this statement is incorrect. At the same time, he recalled that Ramon Novarro and Helen Hayes came to the East to shoot the film "Son-Daughter" and were not very satisfied.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, many male and female Hollywood stars have had considerable success in performing Eastern roles in the past, such as Richard Barthelmess in "Broken Blossoms," Edward G. Robinson in "The Hatchet Man," Warner Oland and Nils Asther have also played the same roles, in addition to Rudolph Valentino, Myrna Loy, and Helen Hayes have also played oriental women, these are Westerners performing oriental roles.</p>
<p>Regarding the dialogue, some people feel that the production technique of "Eskimo", using a native language with English subtitles, can be completely applied to "The Good Earth" for comparison, and it is much more appropriate to use English completely, although there are various difficulties.</p>
<p>In order to solve the above two problems, it is now being considered to use two kinds of dialogue. One is English and the other is Chinese. In the future, Chinese will be used when it is released in the East, and English will be used in the West. As for the actors, there will also be two teams, Chinese and Americans, each filming one film.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Good Son, Good Wife (Born to be Kissed) (11)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>After Tom left, Mr. Pan was still standing still, his mind full of thoughts. After a while, he walked to the door of the large restaurant and carried his secretary, Miss Newbright, out. He ordered her to find the local prosecutor. Miss Newbright was startled when she heard this and quickly asked what was wrong. Pan Qidao said, "There is a small problem. That delusional woman has colluded with my son, and I want to find a way to deal with her." What method did he use? Only his cunning mind could think of it. At this time, Tom had already returned to the small apartment where Eddie and Kitty lived together. They were in high spirits, unaware that a trap had been set up, waiting to catch a turtle in a jar. At first, Eddie didn't quite believe it. But Tom told her, "My father and I have already made it clear. He just wants me to be happy, and he can do anything." He also told her everything about his conversation with his father, and she finally believed it. Tom even called her Mrs. Tom Panqi, which made Eddie's heart beat faster with happiness. She said, "I also want to do many things: I want to hire a teacher to re-teach my English... I also want to study some French... I will no longer use lemon juice to wash my hair in the future..." Tom didn't wait for her to continue, and sealed her words with a kiss on her lips. After a while, she said again, "My clothes, I will try to keep them simple in the future... Like those friends of yours in Palm Beach... Can we two always be together at first?" Tom called her, "Baby, of course you can. Don't worry." After he said that, he told her that he had to go back to his father's party. He said, "This is the last time I'm going alone. I'll call you first thing tomorrow. I'll have the pastor take care of everything for us." Eddie hugged his hand as if she was still a little scared and asked, "Tom, is everything real?" Tom kissed her again and comforted her, "Sweetheart, don't worry. Everything is real. Go to sleep well, tomorrow will be a hard day."</p>
<p>After Tom left, Eddie happily took off her clothes and sat on the bed. Kitty and a sailor went out to play. Eddie was so happy that she wanted to sit and wait for Kitty to come back and tell her all the good news. Suddenly, someone knocked on the door outside. Eddie quickly put on a coat and got out of bed to ask who it was. No one answered outside, so she opened the door a crack to take a look. Unexpectedly, a man's foot had already stretched in. He pushed the door open. He ran in, closed the door again, and turned the key to lock the door. He then took off his upper body clothes. Eddie was so scared that she screamed, but the man just looked at her and smiled. After a while, someone knocked on the door again and knocked very urgently. The man went to open the door. As soon as the door opened, a policeman stood outside, followed by another. The policeman in front said, "We want to see Miss Eddie." The man who came in first put his hand on Eddie's shoulder and said, "Do you have official business?" Eddie inexplicably pushed the man's hand away, but the man hugged her and said, "Sweetheart, don't be afraid, I'm here." Eddie shouted at the police, "Who is this person? I don't know him!" But the policeman just smiled and didn't answer, and moved aside. A photographer came up from behind and took a picture of them... Eddie was wearing a nightgown, and the strange man was only wearing a shirt, and his arm was on Eddie's shoulder! After the photographer took the picture, he mischievously said, "This is great, thank you both." Then the police officer strode to Eddie and shouted, "Put on your clothes. Come with us!" They took Eddie away. (To be continued)</p>
