<p>英</p>
<p>丨由法國方面觀察丨</p>
<p>中國西陲之危機。已略如昨述。然英人之外。尙有法國之態度。亦堪注目。法人雖無十分露骨侵略之行動。而見微知著。吾國人亦不能不有所警惕焉。</p>
<p>據本月初外電。法人以我國西沙羣島。（約當東經一百十度與北緯十六度之交）乃夏秋炎風進襲安南必經之路。我國不能於此設立氣象台。致不能事先有所凖備。須由法國佔領云云。夫西沙羣島。向爲我國領土。其地距法屬安南甚近。法人之注意。已非一日。日故我國當局曾擬於該羣島規劃建設觀象台。一則以利航海之旅行。一則以杜野心者之覬覦。徒以内亂遷延。未獲實現。致予法人以口實。而有佔領該島之心。其志固不僅在於觀象台之設立面已。此一事也。當去歲四月間。法國政府曾正式發表官報。宣佈佔領法屬安南英屬北婆羅洲與美領菲列濱島間之九珊瑚小島。（約當東經一百十五度與北緯十度之交）當時曾引起遠東各關係國家之極大注意。夫以絕少經濟價値之島嶼。乃至出以突然之手段。攫爲已有無怪國人疑其有控制我國南海海權之意。此又可與進佔西沙羣島之說。連類並觀之一事也。抑法國在遠東之勢力。向以安南爲唯一根據。地因此愈感有必須完成其南海海權控制之必要。吾人觀於法自租我廣州灣而後。不能繼英還威海衛而還我。以實行華府會議之宣言。足以爲證。若由廣州灣之經營。而使雷州海南之膏腴。（廣州灣在雷州半島之東）與榆林港灣之雄勝。（在海南島之南端。日俄之役波羅的海艦隊曾泊於此。）悉入於法國勢力之掌握。則今日九小島與西沙羣島之淪陷。猶我西南邊患之小焉者耳。</p>
<p>雖然。法人之經營。尙不僅在海權。而尤在大陸政策之擴張。試觀彼方在安南所經營之殖民事業。最爲五人所不可忽視者也。即如由東京灣之海濱。沿富良江流域。築滇越幹路以深入雲南之腹地。更以河内爲中心。築路以抵我桂省之鎭南邊境。使貫通全越與桂省之交通、皆其明證。現時滇省之經濟命脈。固已岌岌乎有操於法人掌握之懼。卽桂省亦將深感不安。此一端也。法自一八九八年租我廣州灣而後。卽於一九○○年。將該地之經營。置於安南總督之下。以二百方英哩之地。現時人口。已達二十萬。凡市政交通商業金融事業。罔不在法人全力控制之中。且又獲得由雷州半島築路以達於内地之權。與我方不割讓南部諸省之諾言。則法之於我西南半壁。早有可以控制之形勢。此又一端也。凡此種種。雖或爲吾人無病之呻吟。然而有備無患。古有明訓。當此列强對於遠東殖民地競謀分割運動劇烈之時。我人返顧西陲。能不惴惴爲之不安耶。</p>

<p>（五）國民大會</p>
<p>（一）批評此章、有一最不可忽視之大前提、卽國民大會、究係制憲機關PruvoivConstitucot、抑爲根據憲法所産生之機關PruvoivConstitucotc是也、查憲草第五十一條第四項、有「制定」憲法之規定、則其爲制憲機關也無欵、則其存在、應先於憲法也、亦無疑、然再觀其他各條、則其組織、其職權、又無不一一待憲法爲之規定、則其似又應爲憲法所産生、其存在、似又應在憲法之後也、亦無疑、顧吾人於此、果應作何解、是非矛盾而何、吾人欲解决此矛盾、則一·根本在憲法上應不作關於國民大會組織職權之規定、二·或將五十一條第四項「制定」二字删去、二者必取其一、庶於法理事實、兩均可通、</p>
<p>（二）第四十七條、關於國民大會之組織、吾人認爲不滿者有四點、一·選舉制度、仍襲傳統代議制度之弊、實太落伍、蓋此種極端地方主義、非但不合時代、抑且不易選拔眞才、二·各縣人口不一、各選一人、殊失公允、且吾國縣數不多、代表過多、旣多窒礙、且各國選舉區之劃分、亦不盡以原有行政區爲標准、欲矯此弊、可參考俄憲第十章、（註六）三·代表選出後、倘有資格不符、或有不能稱職之時、似應由國民罷免之、憲法於此未有規定、應加補充、四·國民代表、責職重大、使命神聖、而其資格限制、僅有年齡一項、似嫌粗疎、</p>
<p>（三）國民大會、旣本諸總理遺敎、自應明定其爲行使統治權之最高機關、復查第五十一條所規定之職權、則似與斯旨未盡相合、此其矛盾者一、且照第七章六十九條之規定、總統及五院各對國民大會負責、而大會對於預算議决、信任投票、質問政策、以及恊贊和·戰·以及大赦之承認追認·諸權、均未規定、則大會又何行使其監督政府之權、而政府實亦無從向大會負責、此其矛盾者二、且大會出席人數、以及表决人數、均未規定、似有玩忽國事之嫌、</p>
<p>（四）復次、複决權之運用、在吾國旣無先例、人民尤無經騐、而憲法對於複决權運用之方式、運用之手續、以及適用之範圍、則并無詳細之規定、將來必發生運用之困難、應預爲注意補充、且國民大會三年一次、則此種複决、非特不足以救濟立法之專横、且將等於虛設、亦應謀所以改正之道也、</p>
<p>（五）國民委員會之設置、法良意美、不失爲一種因地制宜之規定、蓋以吾國幅員遼闊、人口衆多民衆政治智識與能力、均甚幼稚、國民大會、頗有尾大不掉之虞也、惟查五十四條、國民大會代、</p>
<p>表之職權、旣於閉會之日終了、而五十五條之規定、國民委員又不以國民大會之代表爲限、則其組織、似未臻健全、蓋其不足以完全承繼國民之統治大權也、</p>
<p>（六）且查五十八條所規定、國民委員會之實權、且較國民大會爲大、以如此不健全而又極少數之組織、負荷如此重大之權職、非特有違民權之原則、且於事實上亦甚危險、蓋一則憲文、並未規定國民委員究應向何處負責、倘利用其大權在握之地位、爲倒行逆施之措置、則絕無可以救濟之餘地、復次、大會與委員會之權力、倘有所衝突、果又如何救濟、亦未提及、將來亦必滋糾紛也、希有以斟酌修正之、</p>
<p>（六）中央與地方之權限</p>
<p>中央地方權限、應如何劃分、世界各國、互異其制、民國以來、時賢學者、爭論尤烈、或主中央集權、或倡聯省自治、事權之界莫分、變亂之禍時起、憲草六十條調和折衷、採均權主義、蓋遵總理遺敎也、惟總理僅示均權之原則、而未有具體之規定、卽所謂全國一致、所謂因地制宜、亦屬抽象、未臻具體、尤待切實之研究、</p>
<p>考世界各國、關於劃公中央地方權限之立法原則、大都爲中央列舉、地方槪括、惟中央列舉内容複雜、各國立法仍異其制、究其利害、尤多出入、（一）照美憲之規定、中央權阴、分爲兩種、一爲特有權、專由中央行使之、二爲共有權、凡未經中央行使之前、各州得行使之、但中央行使之後、各州法律卽歸無效、而其餘未經規定之權、統歸各州行使、此爲美制之特點、亦爲美制獨具之優點、蓋美制之長、一則中央事權、可澈底有力行使於各州、二則各州亦得充分發展其自治能力也、（二）德憲中央列舉之權限、有專由中央行使者、有屬於中央而中央不行使、由邦政府代爲行使、中央僅有監督權者、此制之弊、卽在中央事權、不能直接而有力的行使於各邦、（三）奥憲中央列舉權限之内容、有三、一爲立法執行二權、均屬中央者、二爲立法權屬於中央、執行權屬於地方者、三爲原則歸定權屬中央、執行權及厘訂細目權屬諸地方者、此制之弊、一爲立法行政二權、不能一致、使中事權、不能有力行使於各省、蓋與德制同其弊也、</p>
<p>於此吾人當可知各國制度利弊得失之所在、惟　人　擇之時、尙須以吾國歷來政治之病象、以及　前政治之需要爲取捨之標凖、吾國歷來政治之缺陷、最　著者、厥有兩點、一則爲中央事權、不能澈底行使於地方、各省獨自爲政、號令不出部門、一則爲地方自治、未能　利推行、而人民政治智識、政治能力、尤無長足之進步、故吾國目前最大之需要、莫如集權興分治、使中央事權、澈底有力行使於各省　以求國家之統一、復使地方自治、得憲法之保障、以求自治之發展、此則美制之特長、亦吾國目前應取之方針也、循此說而衡校今日之憲草、吾人以爲第六十一條之規定、實太軟弱、而其所列舉之事項、尤　龐雜、吾人之意、中央特有之權、祇須限於最少限度、惟應由中央嚴格執行、絕不許各省越權、如美憲第一條第十項、卽有規定各州不得爲某種事項之强性的規定、此其一、復次、第六十二條所規定之各項中、如户籍、如警備治安、如敎育文化、如衛生防疫、如運輸事業、如森林漁業···等項、似可責成各省辦理、可於六十一條之下、另添一候、規定中央與省之共有權、在中央不行使時、可本一三○條、以及一三六條之精神、交省執行、但中央行使以後、各省法律卽歸無效、此其、一、再則、憲草六十二條所指之地方、當除省在外、則省究作何事、俱無規定、更有補充之必要也、</p>
<p>第六十三條、關於軍政之規定、太過簡單、似無當於吾國目前之特情、軍政紛擾、實爲吾國最大之病象、亟應於憲法上、對於軍隊之調遣、軍費之支配、軍械之儲藏、軍人之制裁、軍人專政之限制、以及各軍之比例等項、爲具體有力之規定、庶符國家制憲之初衷、並可收撥亂反正之實效其次財政問題、亦與吾國統一和平極有關係、則關於課稅之劃分、似未可僅用空洞無際之條文、而應以租稅性質爲標準、作具體明確之規定、俾免日後之爭執、</p>
<p>（七）中央政制</p>
<p>中央政制、應如何創建、愚於拙著現代憲政論中、略有論述、茲事重大、當待專論、今僅就憲文、稍加批評、</p>
<p>（一）國民政府　本節第六十九條、規定總統及五院各對國民大會負其責任、查本章第二節總統形同木偶、並無實權、旣無權力、獨令負責、揆諸權責平衡之理、似有未通、且總統旣不負實際責任，則於事實上、又何來可負之責任、此又跡近法理的矛盾矣、至論各院向國民大會負責、但國民大會須三年開會一次、平時常常閉會、則所謂負責云云、豈非等於具文、第七十一條、國民政府統率陸海空軍、然國民政府旣爲各方雜凑之組織、並無獨當一面之首領、則統率之權、究應屬於何人、憲文未載、似屬不妥、</p>
<p>）二（總統　第七十七條、總統被選舉資格、僅設年齡的限制一種、姑無論總統實權之大小如何、以一國元首之尊、規定定如此輕鬆、實屬玩忽已甚、第八十一條、司法院或考試院院長副院長、在國民大會閉會期間、均因事故去職時、由總統提經國民委員會之同意、任命代理院長、然立法委員、監察委員、因事去職、如何補充、抑或無須補充、未有規定、國民大會閉會時間甚長、不能不早爲顧及也、</p>
<p>（三）行政院　行政院之職權、照八十七條之規定、由各部會所分掌、照九十條之規定、其重要者、又均取决於會議、則於事理上、行政院長當無實權之可言、然照八十六條之規定、行政院長、一則須因立法院之不信任而去職、一則又須因監察院之彈劾而去職、以一毫無實權之木偶、負荷雙重壓迫之責任、揆諸法理、如何可通、且僅就八十六條而論、倘立法院之不信任案、或監察院之彈劾案、爲國民委員會否决時、行政院與立法院·監察院之衝突、應如何調處、立法院與監察院於此究應負何責任、何竟無一字規定、行政院長之重重受制、毫無實權旣如彼、立法監察兩院之毫無顧忌又如此、設其濫用職權、果將如何防止、而行政院究將如何放乎推行政務科、默察國情、靜觀世變、此種政制、甚望有以修正之也、</p>
<p>）四（立法院　立法院、在本憲草之地位、僅爲洽權機關、且如前章規定、已有國民大會·國民委員會、兩大政權機關之設、則立法院之人數、似不必有二百人之多、第九十五條、立法院有議决其他關於重要國際事項之權、重要一義、易爲主觀所左右、最易引起爭執、此種字句、似不應入憲、第九十六條·第二項、以質詢與不信任二案牽涉一起、實最易爲野心家所利用、而引起政潮、且不信任案、照前節之規定、應向國民委員會提出之、此處則未加明定、再則不信任案、倘不能通過、立法院是否應行解散、重選、均未規定、卽就傳統憲政原理而論、亦殊欠妥也、</p>
<p>（五）司法院　司法行政部應歸司法院、抑歸行政院、時賢爭執、迄無定論、此次憲草毅然以之歸入司法院、此殆出於所謂保障司法獨立之意、夫司法獨立、天經地義、吾人何得稍持異義、然司法獨立、亦應有其正確之界說、僅指審判獨立而言也、至於司法政策、則與一國之大政方針、關係至切、殊未可任其獨標一織、各國司法部之所以隸屬於行政院、殆亦因此、是則憲草規定、如否妥當、尙待商議也、</p>
<p>（六）考試院　考選委員會、憲草未經規定、諒因此種機關不必常設、願有節約之精神、似較現制爲進步、惟考試頗爲國家之大政、考選委員之地位、當甚爲尊嚴究應如何任命、如何設置、似亦應於憲法規定之、</p>
<p>（七）監察院　監察院之職權如何、其行使之範圍何如、行使之方式如何、均未有具體規定、恐增將來行使之困難、應稍爲詳及之、（未完）</p>

<p>將來一旦實行危險堪虞</p>
<p>彭學沛提案原文</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會、此次在京舉行全體會議、對於内政部次長彭學沛提議、改用金本位之過渡辦法、業經决定、交財政部幣制委員會研究、俟研究結果、擬具辦法、再由財部縝密考慮進行、新新社記者、探悉本市金融界、對於採用虛金本位問題、認爲利少害多、并非是一種澈底辦法、要知、中國本身、平時旣無相當凖備、又無餘力購買海外黄金、如一旦實行金本位、則其危險、當不言而喩、但彭氏以此舉對我國國際貿易及貸借關係、採用金本位制、實已成迫切之需要、茲特覓錄彭氏提案原文如下、中國在貨幣上之國際地位、日陷孤立、其對外貿易·及貨借關係、暴露於絕大之風險、每次銀價變動、中國卽蒙受浩刧、一九二九年銀價跌落時如此、此次如銀價抬高又將如此、採用金本位制、實已成迫切之需要、顧欲採用金本位制、則有二大難關、一爲中國驟雖得此鉅量之儲、二爲中國人民向慣用銀、亦不易驟變此習慣、爲使自銀本位移入金本位、較爲便利、且漸有希望起見、謹擬、</p>
<h3 id="c117">過渡辦法 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>如下、（一）由政府准許中央銀行、得依據銀紙幣同樣之凖備比例、發行金紙幣、保證凖備、不得過四成、現金凖備、不得少於六成、其保證凖備、得用公債或商業票據、現金凖備、得用現金、或於十足現金、爲凖備之金單位、或在金本位國家之存欵、（二）金銀紙幣、同時流通市面、不規定固定之比例、依時價兌換、如現今市面之銀幣與銅幣、（三）金幣單位、等於現今海關所用之金單位之四分之一、（四）中央銀行、應盡量增加金凖備、發行金紙幣、並努力推行之、（五）各銀行得向</p>

<p>「本過渡辦法之利益」、金在中　之主要、用途、爲裝飾品及儲蓄之用具、而不爲貨幣、年來金之輸出常超於輸入、採用過渡辦法、則金在中國、增加一重要之用途、卽可爲國内交易之媒介如此、雖不能完全阻止出超傾向、但必可作相當之挽救無疑、（二）發行金紙幣、國家可增一項新收入、以改良貨幣、以紙幣之信用、並無絲毫妨碍、（三）市面籌碼加多、可收相當</p>
<h3 id="c120">提高物價 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>之效、（四）一般公衆所死藏不用或耗於裝飾之金、將有大部分活用於金融界、（五）各銀行金儲、將漸次增高、卽全國之金儲、亦將漸次增高、（六）公衆漸得使用金幣之習慣、（十）漸次以銀易金、俟過渡到金本位時、只須變換一部分貨幣、不致引起過於激烈之變動、（八）現金一般公衆買賣小量金子、往往於一出入之間、大受盤剥、採用金紙幣後、可免此弊、亦可增加國民對金之樂用、（九）中央銀行在國外之存欵、得以利用爲金紙幣之凖備、（十）凡與</p>

<h3 id="c130">同盟公約决定解散 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>四月一日起實行</p>
<p>川河七輪公司同盟、增漲水脚、引起滬上川帮各客商、停止辦貨、拒絕運輸、此事爭執已達五十餘日、雖經各方調解、殊難得到完滿解决、連日各輪公司會議、討論結果、决自四月一日起、將公約實行解除、並定今日再召開廢除同盟後善後辦法、與新水脚重訂會議、此事與川帮貨運上、關係頗爲重大、記者爲明瞭此事内幕眞相計、特親赴各輪公司調查、茲述其原因如下、</p>
<h3 id="c131">民生成衆矢之的 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>川河輪發起同盟、增漲水脚、將貨價低廉之國産品、漲費至一倍以上、而且不别等級、量尺貨與論斤貨、更有不近情理之辦法、引起川商大反對、上海方面、停貨不裝、重慶方面各商帮、更與民生公司重大交涉、致使民生公司成爲集矢之的、弄巧成拙、殆非始料所及、</p>
<h3 id="c132">各航商恊議補救 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>自二月二十日、同盟新費實施後、川河線内各輪公司、同受停止辦貨之影響、長此相持、輪公司損失甚巨、按滬渝直放輪船、往來一次、歷時匝月、大輪開銷、約需二萬元成本、卽淺水船、亦在一萬元左右、若同盟增費問題、一日不决、卽川輪殊難同受無形損失、二十八日、太古·怡和·捷江·三北·義華·等各輪公司代表、假怡和洋行、開會討論、打開新局面辦法、僉以四月份爲上江大水期、照例亦須减短水脚、各公司今受同盟束縛、殊不値得、乃電詢重慶民生總公司、本月期滿後、同盟公約、是否繼續、抑或解散、</p>
<h3 id="c133">同盟公約决解散 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>此電去後、旋得渝民生總公司覆電、其措詞非常圓滑、大致謂、川河輪合作同盟、在試行期滿後延長問題、民生公司、深願與各同業、誠意合作、繼續同盟、惟是重慶各業各帮、對民生公司責難甚嚴、殊使難望延續、其大意如此、各輪公司、得到民生覆電、遂議决從四月一日起、卽將二月十一日所訂川輪同盟合作公約、實行根本廢除、仍由七公司各自經營、藉此排除困難阻力、而發展一新局面、在同盟期内所訂不合理之運費、亦根本撤除、由各輪公司另議一適合各業各帮新運價、以資遵守、</p>
<h3 id="c134">另訂合理新運費 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>前日報載、渝商帮議定新運費辦法、於四月一日實行等語、記者詢諸各輪公司負責人、據稱、此乃重慶各商帮所擬議中之片面水脚價、爲各航商所斷難同意者、蓋照其所定量尺貨價、每噸僅有十一元另、按運往漢口貨價、尙不止此數、此與同盟時所訂一百元一噸者、同爲不合情理之謬舉、此項消息、或有作用、今姑不論、惟在解散同盟之後、各輪公司已經公議、將川河運費、分爲大水·平水·淺水·等三個時期、主要之棉紗水脚、將减爲淺水時十六元、平水時十四元、大水時十二元、論尺碼計者、擬平水時每尺以二元計、漲水時减收八折、淺水時加升二成半、如此則最爲公平、其他貨物、則分等論級、决勿稍使偏枯也、</p>
<h3 id="c135">今日再召集會議 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>川河輪解散同盟、距今日祗有兩天、便須實行、關於新水脚價、旣决定取合理化、故各輪公司、昨日已經商定、准於今日召集七輪公司、假座三北、開一大會、討論解散同盟後善後辦法、並將各貨之新水脚、卽在今日會議席上重行公議修訂、一經確定、便卽通告川中各帮商、使川河五十餘天之商航兩界的爭執、與川中洋雜貨帮之停止辦貨、在今日會議之下、均可解决、一塲風潮、從此可告一段落矣、</p>

<h3 id="c193">怎樣研究憲法 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>（一）問</p>
<p>讀書指導··</p>
<p>最近政府立法院發表了憲法草案，希望大家提出意見，我想我們連什麽是憲法都不懂，怎樣提出意見呢？先生，憲法是否人人要懂得？憲法與一般民衆有什麽關係？憲法的好壞與人民有什麽利害？這些我都希望知道，但不知怎樣入乎研究，請你們給我解答一下吧！······</p>
<p>丨丨林恨我來信</p>
<p>（二）答</p>
<p>林君來信所詢的問題、確是一般人心目中的問題。現在一般人對於政治實在太漠不關心了，其原因之一是議論國事常會得罪人，所以按照「明哲保身」原則還是「莫談」爲妙；但這還不是最大的原因，最大的原因是近年來在野的政治意見，政策，政綱等等，在朝的政治設施等等實在太多，而且說得都很動聽，又似乎都很有理由。但到現在不但一般人所需要的安定生活絲毫没有得到，反而有日本强奪滿蒙，法佔九小島，英國覬覦「班洪」等等瓜分中國的危機；反而有窮困，失業、飢寒等等的切身痛苦。於是一般人絕望了、對於一切政治主張，設施都不願再理它了。這是對的，然而也是錯誤的。其所以對者，是這些主張是一張不兌現的支票，完全是一套賣弄手法的把戲，但是我們的政治雖糟，究非是没有清明的希望，我們生活雖極痛苦，究非是没有福利的前途··因此，我們對於政治灰心，不發生興趣，是一個極嚴重的錯誤。須知政治我們愈不去研究它，一切騙人的把戲固然愈有賣弄的機會，而暴露事實眞相的實踐的理論，反而爲人所漢視，弄到是非不明，黑白混淆，而政治也愈糟，我們的生活也愈痛苦。所以我們對於政治的態度，不但不應當作消極的不理，反而要作積極的研究，惟有如此，我們纔能不爲歪曲事實的宣傳所蒙蔽，亦惟有如此，我們纔能認清我們的前途，我們纔决不會悲觀，意氣消沉，反而有奮鬭，努力的决心。就林君來信講，似乎對於研究政治依然有點「漠視」的態度，故借此機會討論一下。</p>
<p>什麽是憲法呢？我們現在且不要下定義，先說憲法的内容，它包含些什麽東西，因爲知道了憲法的内容是什麽，也就知道了憲法是什麽了。憲法的内容包括兩種，一爲實質的，一爲形式的。形式的内容是討論憲法的地位，訂立，修改手續，與普通法不同的所在。實質的内容是講憲法所要規定的是些什麽東西。形式的内容與我們所要知道的憲法無多大關係，現在暫且撇開不講，當然這不是說它與憲法是没有關係或者是不重要的。憲法的實質内容所包含的，可分爲三種··第一，它規定人民的參政權，討論人民是否有實地管理國家的權期，及權限的範圍。第二，國家政權的形式，這又分兩方面，一種是說政權的來源，或其所屬，如少數人或多數人獨裁等等，及執行與立法的關係。一種是說中央與地方權限之劃分。第三，是國家所要實現的幾個主要目的，通俗點說，亦卽國家所國做到的是些什麽事。這一部分包括許多國家的基礎法令等等。</p>
<p>憲法是個什麽東西，大致是如此，現在就說研究憲法的方法。</p>
<p>第一研究憲法不應單看到紙面上的意義，應當觀察到它是否能實現，卽它的理想或目的是否在當時的社會上有實現的可能。換句話說，我們研究憲法要研究它的内容的本質，不能爲它的飾辭所蒙蔽。</p>
<p>普通資本主義國家，誇耀着民主政治，不論是共和國抑或君主立憲，在憲法上規定人人都有參政權，在法律上人人都是平等的，人人都有集會，結社，出版，言論等自由，但實際上怎麽樣呢？仍舊是有錢有勢的人把住政權，統治者仍是一班士大夫階級。在所謂民主或君主立憲國家，選舉爲一羣政黨所操縱，它們標榜着各種爲國爲民的政綱政策，以冀奪取選民，角逐選舉。其實它們祇是爲着少數人忠誠地服務，政綱政策不過是一個幌子罷了。但是所選出來的代表却非他們不行。因此，社會上少數人想要獨攬政權，藉以欺壓多數人，是很容易的；他們可收買一些政黨，或遣人出來組織些政黨，讓他們去活動，去爭取政權。如果這些政黨執政了，則那些少數人在表面上雖則仍與一般人一樣，無甚特權可言，但實際上他們却可左右一國的政治。所以普通在憲法上規定的主權屬於全體人民，是一碗迷魂湯，企圖掩飾少數人獨攬政機的假面具而已。（未完）</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>名人的軼事，我們本來是很歡迎的。但是不知怎的？每刋一段大人先生的軼事，過一天總要被動的更正一下。在作者以爲道德聽塗說，可作文料；在編者以爲茶餘酒後，可資談助；雙方都是無所用心，也别無作用的。不過據我這好多年編輯上的經騐看來，這種大人先生的軼事，實在是可談而不可談；可登而不可登的。在一部分的讀者讀了，也許以爲這是做人情；拍馬屁，而在大人先生本身，却又以爲這是開玩笑，駡山門。所以從此以後，我們不再歡迎當代名人軼事，與其惹是招非，還是自己「火燭小心」。</p>
<p>在底下的一排，我們不是常有「遊踪所至」「婦女園地」「世界珍聞」「小食譜」等一樣的麽？這一樣分類很多，除上述四種外，尙有「科學趣談」「小常識」「短篇小說」「笑的總動員」「拉雜話」「風土小誌」「小園藝」「小工藝」「獨幕劇」「小小說」等十種，凡是新頴雋永的材料，無不在歡迎之列。但那每種的字數，至多以一千字爲限，因爲太多了，就要排得密密層層地，好像螞蟻扛死蒼蠅似的，忒煞難看，而一般眼光已打折扣的老先生，也惟有望「字」興歎了。</p>
<p>漫畫本來每星期一次刋在底下一排的地位，每次總是四五張刋在一起。現在也打算轉變了，變成每天一張。譬如每星期吃一桌和菜，雖覺豐盛，不如每天吃一樣佳餚，更來得開胃。這種漫畫，除由黄士英張英超江棟良三君擔任外，也歡迎投稿，其他題頭畫，以圖案爲妙，大小必須依照本刋現定的尺寸，放大四分之三，以便縮小製版。</p>
<p>無論文稿畫稿，必須註明作者的姓名住址，並加蓋圖章，文稿上必須註明字數，這三件事，算是本刋與諸位作家的約法三章。要是不願遵守的，那麽刋登之後，作却酬論，恕我不客氣了。（附帶聲明，來稿無論刋用與否，槪不退還）　　「春秋」轉變伊始，特地刋登秦瘦鷗君譯述的「御香缥緲錄」一書，作爲紀念。此書係前清德齡公主用英文寫成、一名「老佛爺時代的西太后」，記的都是當年清宮中的秘史，十分有趣。秦君本爲名小說家，譯筆也工緻可喜，一些兒不失原意。我們刋登此書的本旨，並不是要使讀者發甚麽「思古之幽情」，只好似請大家看梅蘭芳登臺表演一部「太眞外傳」罷了。</p>
<p>「春秋」是要轉變了。但是從那一天起開始轉變呢？喏！中華民國二十三年四月一日。（是日應出之兒童周刋，移至四月四日兒童節出版）。</p>

<p>— 露</p>
<p>這篇題目很俏皮，或者有人會當作是一篇俏皮的故事，其實作者是含着眼淚寫的。</p>
<p>前幾日有一位某女士，投函給本報本埠增刋的編者，伊說··「······我是某寫字間裏一隻花瓶，在幾隻花瓶中那位××竟看中了我。······他去年有二次來調笑我，但都給我用巧妙的方法躱避了。······現在他竟進一步，開了旅館的房間。······我掙扎了一夜，總算没有屈服。······我要是辭去這位置呢？就要眼見父母弟妹挨餓！······所以我想只有走着艾霞女士一條路。······」看了這篇記載我們就可以曉得女子職業實在是當今一個嚴重問題。對於某××的無法無天，非但他個人的人格破産，而且也是摧殘婦女職業的大罪人之一。不過，我們這裏暫且不要說他。</p>
<p>這年頭兒，做女子的也太倒霉了。尤其是姿色美好的，更加危險。所以這「花瓶」兩字的産生多麽不幸，是多麽痛心的事啊！不過花瓶究竟是供人賞鑑的東西，而且有着「能看不能動」的警告在這意思裏面。充其量，也不過說它是「不合實用」而已。我想某女士，還是好好自慰，不必走艾霞女士的一條路！因爲我人所有的是兩件寳貝，一件是生命，一件是靈魂。我人只要不賣靈魂，生命上的危害，腦海裏的打擊，生活上的困苦，都不算一會事！假使出賣了靈魂的話，那纔有苦没處說呢！</p>
<p>末了，我還要希望職業婦女們，此後要放大你的目光，凖備了你的眞正學識，多研究點專門技術。一方面還要節儉，不要將你的生活提高到你的水平綫以上。這樣，是不會再做花瓶的，也不再會有人將花瓶的水當茶喝的！否則，就不當花瓶，也會得到别的花樣呢！</p>

<p>（三）石疵　石華硯史列舉石疵，共有十五種，然此十五種中，已有多種，因後來審美心理之轉移，而漸漸變爲美文，大抵或因其疵在乎堅硬，然不在墨堂，無妨於墨，而文彩確有可觀者··或因其疵，石性並不稍異，且足增美觀者，或因其疵惟下巖或大西洞所獨有，足爲佳石之證者，愛硯家對於此類從種種方面觀察，遂但覺其可貴而不以爲病，此乃石疵變成美文的緣故，試將石疵分别紀錄出來。</p>
<p>（甲）石疵而稱爲美文的</p>
<p>一·翡翠紋　凝綠若洒汁，亦稱翡翠點，有重綠淺綠兩種，與眼同一筋脈，惟黄碧色不足重，綠色則人人寳愛之，　　二·黄龍紋　灰黄色如龍蛇横斜於石上曰黄龍，色焦澀而含土氣，且横在硯心者爲石病，若燦燦然露金沙之光，或隱成小金圈形者，則甚美麗，</p>
<p>三·玉帶　白凝於綠纎而長者，或純白者，稱爲玉帶，渾融潔凈，極爲美觀，又有白筯大於金銀線約一倍者曰白間紋，微夾一縷嫩青色者曰青間紋，都是玉帶一類。</p>
<p>四·玉點　白點有如菉豆大者曰玉點，亦曰石榴仁，精瑩嫩潤者殊不易得，　　五·金銀線　偶有一絲兩絲見於硯面，其脈理黄者謂之金線紋，白者謂之銀線紋，細密不損毫者，文人愛重之，惟粗疏者不取。</p>
<p>六·麻雀斑　點墨瘢相似者曰麻雀斑，又名，鷓鴣斑，其點作紫褐色，頗可觀，點若麻雀斑而稍長成行密比者，稱爲松皮紋，則爲中次品。</p>
<p>七·五采釘　五采釘有白質五采釘綠質五采訂兩種，雖堅實拒刃，但惟大西洞有之，且寳光閃爍，更可寳貴，硯史又有所謂硃砂釘者，亦稱硃砂斑，鮮妍光彩，而不在墨堂者爲最貴，（大西洞尤明潤）按卽五采釘一類，故附之。</p>
<p>八·蟲蛀　剥蝕如蟲嚙，（宋譜謂之鑽）水冲激成孔，大小不一，足以證明其石之嫩潤，在墨堂外者頗見風趣，故文人重之。</p>
<p>按他書紀載，又有所謂古斑，杉木紋，　血邊，都爲中次等之美文，更有一種玳瑁斑，色青紫若鼈甲形，而有深紫色之斑點，宋末明初之石有之，日人最重視，稱爲卽水巖亦不多見。</p>
<p>（乙）眞正的石疵</p>
<p>石疵中有數項確實可厭的石疵，一，鐵線·在　皮相隔處鑿之，可應手而斷，二，水線，如硬裂紋。亦稱警紋，三，豬鬃眼，如拔去豬鬃毛孔，石理不凝結，四，油涎光，一作蜓蚰光，如油著水面，堅滑不受墨，老坑之病，此爲最大，五，砂釘，如指頭大，頑硬如釘，與五采釘異。</p>

<p>在紅日初上的早晨，阿水生和銀寳的母親正要吃早飯，却不見銀寳。他們倆便四處去尋找，走到牛棚裏，却見銀寳正蹲在老黄牛的面前，疵疾地瞧着。那老黄牛臥在地上，嘴裏喘着氣，張大了眼睛，也在瞧銀寳。</p>
<p>阿水生很厅異的喊道··「銀寳，爲什麽不去吃早飯？一清早便躱到這裏來看病牛，今天，它是要離開我們去了！」</p>
<p>銀寳蹲在地下，對阿水生說道··「爹，今天老黄年要離開我們去麽？可是把它賣去了麽？它和我們相處了好多年，我實在捨不得它。它已是病了，再要賣給人家去殺掉，豈不罪過呢？爹，請你饒了它吧！讓它再住在我們家裏。」</p>
<p>這幾名話，銀寳似乎說得很可憐的，不料却觸動了伊父親的怒氣，扳起面孔，發出精暴的聲音喝道··「你道小孩子懂得什麽！這是大人的事，和你們小孩子無關。你爹没有錢用，你可知道麽？在這個年時，人也要賣哩，休說一條牛；何况是一條病得快死無力耕田的老黄牛！快到屋子裏去，不要囉囌。」</p>
<p>父親的威嚴？銀寳是一向知道的，伊哭喪着臉，不敢再說什麽。伊的母親便抱着伊，望屋子裏走去，恐怕阿水生的老拳就要揮出來，銀寳要受一頓痛打哩。</p>
<p>午飯之前，阿水生的姑母忽然從鄰近的村莊裏來看他們夫婦倆。見面之後，就絮絮叨叨的把事情告訴他們。原來阿水生的姑母的丈夫阿奎，病倒在床上已有好幾天了，病勢沈重得很，急得伊無法可想，祗好跑到這裏來商量。</p>
<p>阿水生很不耐煩的坐着聽他姑母講話，他只是掏頭，表示無可奈何的樣子。</p>
<p>他姑母非常失望，幾乎要哭出來。於是，銀寳娘忍不住說道··「阿水生借五塊錢給姑母吧，明年三月裏伊有會錢抵當的，我知道這是趙家的頭會。」</p>
<p>於是阿水生點點頭答應了。</p>
<p>夫婦倆便請他們的姑母在這裏用過午飯，買牛的主顧來了。阿水生先引導着到牛棚裏去看過後，回來坐定。價錢早已講妥了，那主顧是個山東人，很爽快的將雪白的大洋取出來，全交給阿水生。阿水生接了，就讓山東人牽那病的老黄牛去。</p>
<p>當老黄牛從牛棚中被牽出來的時候，說也奇怪，它雖是畜生，好似通靈性的，知道它的末日到了，哀鳴着，强住身子不肯走，不情願離開它的主人，它的故居，丨丨丨破舊的牛棚。銀寳在旁邊呆呆地看着，嘴裏雖不敢響，心中却是何等的難過啊！伊的一雙小眼睛裏已飽含着一包眼淚。</p>
<p>到底那可憐的疾病的老黄牛跟着山東人去了，離開了它的主人，它的故居，它的小友丨丨銀寳。唉！屠塲，是它一生勞苦的歸宿之處！　　阿水生的姑母也借到了五塊大洋，趕緊回家去，要救伊的丈夫。當伊走在路上時，心裏暗想，牛老了，病了，還可以賣幾個錢用用，但是人？難道人不如牛嗎？</p>
<p>阿水生夫婦得到了賣牛的錢，商量去配他們的用途，好在明年買新牛的資本已有了他們的計劃，暫時可以不憂。</p>
<p>銀寳却躱在屋隅偷偷地出淚，可算惟有伊是領會到老黄牛的悲哀了。</p>

<p>僞組織參加遠運會</p>
<h3 id="c199">我國始終拒絕 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>全國體協會發表重要聲明</p>
<p>▲體恊會昨電覆菲律賓僑胞</p>
<p>▲沈嗣良否認允許個人參加</p>
<p>中華全國體育恊進會、爲表示我國始終堅决拒絕僞組織之參加遠東運動會、昨特發表公告如下、</p>
<p>邇來報載消息、迭見滿洲參加遠運會事、議論紛紛、莫衷一是、全係某方揑造空氣、淆惑觀聽、全國體育恊進會早已堅决拒絕、迄未有退讓之表示、卽所謂在滬舉行之三國會議、亦係執行常會性質、恊會事前已特電通知菲恊會、該會在滬舉行時、不得提出討論滿洲參加問題、</p>
<p>▲恊會電覆菲島僑胞</p>
<p>又昨恊會接得馬尼剌新中國日報來電、詢問滿洲請求加入遠運會事、恊會得電後、卽復電如次「馬尼剌新中國日報鑒、我國始終拒絕滿洲加入遠東運動會、迄無退讓之表示、全國體恊會、艶」</p>
<p>▲圓桌會議討論範圍</p>
<p>申時通訊社記者、昨往訪體恊會主幹沈嗣良氏、據沈氏談、此次圓桌會議、係一種普通常會、討論本屆遠運大會之各項進行程序、會中所討論者、爲大會總錦標之範圍、及友誼賽應改爲錦標賽之各種要案、每屆會前、均照例舉行、並無其他作用、外界因傳聞失實、誤以爲圓桌會議、内容如何如何、均屬揣測之詞、至於會期、俟菲日代表抵滬後、方能决定、</p>
<p>▲否認允許個人參加</p>
<p>沈氏繼稱、日方以僞組織參加問題提出、我必嚴重拒絕、甚至自動退出、亦所不惜、乃外間所傳、有允許僞國個人參加之說、空谷生風、令人莫測、想均出於日人顚倒虛實、圓逞奸謀之烟幕彈、（按敎部社會敎育司司長張炯、於二十七日在京發表談話、謂如以僞國名義、前來參加遠東運動會、我國勢必堅持、但若以個人資格參加、而無僞國名義、則當然允其加入、）我當局、决抱定不不喪權辱國宗旨、至馬尼剌僑胞之來電、本會已覆電解釋矣、</p>
<p>▲各界慨允捐助經費</p>
<p>沈氏續談、本會現正積極籌備遠運會及預選之各項手續、前向郓軍政當局籌集經費、蒙各界摡允贊助、前途甚屬樂觀、並已收到捐欵一萬餘元、至預選之籌備、委員會定於四月十日開會、現已通知各委來滬出席云、</p>

<p>（港訊）上星期六（二十四日）特别銀牌决寒、對壘者爲南華甲與威爾殊、此塲爲奪標賽、所謂成敗利鈍、均在此一舉者也、所以港中球迷、咸爲之顚倒欲狂、擠擁非常、咸欲暏南華凱歌高奏也、詎料比賽結果、南洋竟以零對三之比見敗、不獨冠軍拱手送與威爾殊、且又飽嘗光蛋滋味、同時令全港球迷大失所望、是則南華已將本屆尋常杯冠軍希望、變成泡影、今又將特别銀牌送諸别人、吾不欲言之矣、是役南華左翼葉北華、因事未出塲助戰、由乙組之伍寳渠補充其缺、故陣容卽大爲遜色、前鋒五虎將、交球多不凖、均如失却主宰、至射球之無力、衝鋒之無勇、及失機誤球等、尤爲餘事、全隊除李天生外、餘均表演失常、故南華之敗也有由矣、反觀威爾殊隊、十一名戰將、聯絡嚴密、傳球迅速、故其勝南華也實藝高一籌、非倖致者、雙方出塲戰將、</p>

<p>— 阿呆</p>
<p>交言曰論，直語曰說。示無人談起，所以直說。換言之，此「說」乃「我說了他一頓」之說，說是非之說，亦卽說長道短之說。其中含有指責，策動，游說之意。編輯則包括一切世間報章雜誌定期刋不定期刋之編緝者。編輯者有何可說呢？今當說之於後··</p>
<p>文壇上正閙「何徐創作問題」，「京派」指爲「海派」之羞，拿未成史的作家的稿子去署上已名投刋，好像開工廠或辦交易所。但一個願出讓，一個願收受；一個偏不願出名，偏不要稿費，一個偏要掠美，偏要拿人家的稿子，而且代負文責，他倆的是是非非，我們且不去管它，這裏要說的是··一班編輯者對於此事也不能不負一些責任。</p>
<p>未威名的作家的稿子，不得編輯者的垂青，眞是千古同慨。但編輯者不同房師，朝廷也未委託他們衡文取士，何必狠狠地抺煞一切新作家呢？據說某雜誌社某次搬家丨丨這是很久以前的事了丨丨工人搬出六七個箱子，其中滿貯外來稿，原信原封，上面一律批兩個字「未閱」！這大槪呌作「雖則七襄（箱），不成報章」。</p>
<p>卽令虛懷若谷，從善如流的編輯先生吧，他却自己立出主見，將稿子删改得一榻糊塗，譬如一朶花送人，護之以綠葉，編者喜此一朶花，將枝葉皆删掉了，他是「限於篇幅」。或則陰陰地在緊要處删改一兩字，如一副美人畫，原來已經過了藝匠的慘淡經營了，他却持彩色偏在傳神的眉目間加以塗抹，毫末之改，要使全體改觀。縱令有時輕易放行，他却大不甘心，必加按語，或一再稱歎，則寃屈作者，曲解原意，何爲寒心。或則明明不可分段的作品給割裂，分登；或則將稿子編在不倫不類的地位，故意的丨丨</p>
<p>所以，我說今茲何徐二公閙創作的亂子，推原其故，實現代編輯先生之羞，無名作家的稿子没有法子出現。無形中汩没了多少天才的佳作！大家在奉行故事，相與依違，没有感覺自己工作中一時代文化的使命！</p>

<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>是一個夜闌人靜的深夜，我被一陣喧閙的胡琴聲閙醒，由街燈傳進來的燈光是這樣昏黄悽淡得可怕。從窗口望過去，天是烏黑的，連一顆小量也没的，擺在窗户上的兩盆蘭花，像一對散髪的野鬼，望着，我揉一揉眼睛特别用力地望着，這散髮好似被暴風吹動着向我撲來一般，我有點害怕，忙把頭縮在被内，誰知這散髮竟變成了兩個巨大的黑影向我一步一步地走來，我用被緊緊地蓋着頭部，丙隻乎抱着一顆正在狂跳的心。</p>
<p>黑影居然壓在我的身上了，我呼吸時感到異常困難。</p>
<p>「不要自己嚇自己，那是兩盆蘭花，那里有什麽鬼呢？」</p>
<p>很清楚地腦子裏好似有個什麽東西在告訴我要我不要有這種無意識的幻想。</p>
<p>但是出了一身冷汗，衣服者濕透了，我仍然不敢伸出頭來　　「長沙麻花，白糖丨米花。『註一』」</p>
<p>隱約地聽到了這每晚聽慣了的喊聲，我似乎胆壯起來了。伸出頭來，蘭花的黑影似手更可怕了，牠像一幅猙獰的面孔，簡直像一個夜叉，我忙轉過頭來，細細地想。</p>
<p>這時我完全清醒了！</p>
<p>蘭花，本來是一個朋友的名字，而且特别含有深長的意義在内的。可惜他在本個月以前剛剛死了，我買蘭花時是夢也想不到他是如此死得快，死得悲慘的。</p>
<p>丨難道今晚是他的靈魂來了嗎？</p>
<p>我有點迷信起來，是的，一個人總有個時候會不知不覺陷在迷信的圈子裏的。</p>
<p>「長丨沙丨麻花，白糖丨米丨花，」的喊聲越來越近了，叮噹叮噹，賣餛飩的鈴聲也接着來了。奇怪，他們好像就在我的窗户下站着不動一般地呌着，響着。</p>
<p>我開始感到煩惱，我覺得他們是不應該擾亂人家的瞌睡的　　丨剛才我要不是被拉胡琴的拉醒，這時不是正在甜美的夢鄕嗎？而且也不會發現窗户上的可怕底黑影。</p>
<p>想到這里，我更惱怒了。</p>
<p>「牙立，）註二（你今晚賺了好多錢？」</p>
<p>他們開始談話了，聽去知道這是那位賣錕飩的在問賣麻花的孩子。</p>
<p>「二百錢還不到，你看我怎的好回去。」</p>
<p>「没得生意咧，我從没斷黑就出門，到這時候還只賺角多錢，這兩天太冷，人家都睡得早，所以没得生意。」</p>
<p>「什麽冷不冷，有錢的人，家裏燒着火爐那怕是下雪也暖和和的。他們晚上打牌打到天亮還有小老婆侍候裝烟，聽差，老媽子在旁邊倒茶。牙立，你爲什麽不到大公館的門口去呢？」</p>
<p>「哼！大公館？他們才不吃你這一碗餛飩。他自己家裏。有的是海參燕窩。」</p>
<p>牙立，莫儘在這里發牢騷，趕快走吧，快天亮了！」</p>
<p>「長沙麻花，白糖丨米花」　　這聲音遠遠地在空中像凄凉的音樂一般奏着時，叮噹叮噹的響聲也隨着牠消逝了。</p>
<p>「註一」兩種都是糖名，長沙的特産。</p>
<p>「註二」牙立，是孩子的意思。</p>

<p>女人偏着散鬆的頭，大聲地笑了起來。</p>
<p>「小聲點。請你小聲點！」</p>
<p>將軍驚惶起來，窘促地向幕外瞭望一下··遠遠近近的峯間，都點綴着紅紅的篝火··坡頭林中則嘹亮着軍士的淫靡的歌聲。</p>
<p>女人就忍着笑，說道··</p>
<p>「那末，你願意我帶你的兵而做我的跟隨嗎？」</p>
<p>「願意的，願意的，······你帶我帶，不是一樣的麽？」</p>
<p>將軍歡喜得呌了起來；帳幕上舞動着他一隻興奮的背臂影。　　「不，如果我來帶你的兵，可不像你那麽地　哪！」</p>
<p>女人望一下桌上高燒的銀燭，便不經意地這樣駁斥。</p>
<p>將軍明白了那是什麽意思，便停止了鬆動索子的手，帶着一臉憐憫的神色，問··</p>
<p>「爲什麽你總是不變心腸，要一直同他們作對呢？」</p>
<p>女人莊重起來，坦白地說··　　「因爲他們存在着，别人簡直活不下去！」</p>
<p>將軍爲難地搔搔他的秃頭，沉默一會，才又小聲懇求似的說··</p>
<p>「除了這個，要求别的不好嗎？」</p>
<p>女人搖搖頭，微笑着。</p>
<p>「那末，明天太陽出來的時候，你便同這個美麗的世界告别了！」</p>
<p>將軍嘆息着，帶着婉惜的樣子。</p>
<p>「那是很好的！」</p>
<p>女人又大笑起來，眼睛裏放出明媚的光輝。</p>
<p>將軍的臉微微灰白了，眼裏充滿着失望的悲哀。走在女人的面前，靜靜地望着她，做出非常同情的聲調說··</p>
<p>「難道我終於不能帮助你一點嗎？」</p>
<p>「你可以帮助一點的！」</p>
<p>「哪一點？」</p>
<p>「就是請你在天亮以前，把我殺掉吧！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽！」</p>
<p>「因爲我是在黑暗中長大起來，也要在黑暗中消滅下去！</p>

<p>翻譯之事，由來久矣！略抄紹興年間普潤大師法雲所編翻譯名義集的前序，爲現代翻譯專家「張目」··</p>
<p>「夫翻譯者，謂翻梵天之語，轉成漢地之言。音雖似别，義則大同，宋僧傳云··如翻錦繡，背面俱舉，但左右不同耳。譯之言易也，謂以所有，易其所無，故以此方之經，而顯彼土之法，周禮掌四方之語，各有其官。東方曰寄，南方曰象，西方曰狄鞮，兆方曰譯。今通西言而云譯者，蓋漢世多事北方，而譯官兼着西語，帮摩騰始至，而譯四十二章，因稱譯也。」云云。</p>
<p>據「我們有考據癖的人」看來，這起源實在非常之早。現代也有翻譯之官，「在官言官」，又頗殊於翻譯，這且不必管。現代翻譯家如譯西書，到頗應注意數事，不僅「買一本好字典」而已也。謹呈其事如左··</p>

<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>「要是我有錢，」卓雲終於破裂了那沉默，「我私人可以借一些給你。可是又没有。而且我本想可以預去一個月薪水的，現在却落了空，因此我自己也成了問題。眞對不起，還是請你到别地方去想想法子吧丨丨你有什麽可想法子的地方没有？」</p>
<p>到這時，依娜才重新抬起了她的眼睛，而且開始說··</p>
<p>「我没有想到要想什麽法子，而且就是要想法子，現在也太遲了，所以你的好意是很容易被辜負的。就是對於你，我起初也没有想到會有麻煩你的意思，要是想到而且知道的話，就不會發生這樣的麻煩了。現在，請你相信我，旣然知道了，我是不會再來麻煩你的。」</p>
<p>說完，她站起來預備走了。</p>
<p>「我還有一個法子，」他啓示似地說，「可是不一定成功；把你的小說賣到什麽書店去。你認識丨好，或者，就是我代你去問。無論成不成功，我總打電話給你。」</p>
<p>雖明知是無望的，依娜還在希望卓雲能打一個含有絲毫活意的電話給她。可是没有電話，没有卓雲給她的電話，卽使是最絕望的。</p>
<p>「不是他自己說，無論成不成功，總會打一個電話來的嗎？」她凄絕地想。「唉，他自己說！他自己說有什麽用？不是他己經自己說了很多？一次一次地答應，又一次一次地不照他所答應的做嗎？</p>
<p>所謂關已到了身邊，就是三十日的太陽已在地球上照耀了。依娜聽到了那關，看到了那關，嗅到了那關，甚至摸到了那關，陰沉的，鋒利的，冰冷的。可是她同時也怡悅似地覺得要那樣才像是過年，那樣緊張，那樣刺激，是無論如何爲過陽曆年的時候所没有的。要是她能在那一年的最後的一天，得到一筆錢，把她所有的帳務都付清，那該是多麽痛快的事情呀！因此她還是在繫念着那無望之望。</p>
<p>「還是去看一次席卓雲再說，」她最後這樣决定。而且，卽使她不去看席卓雲，她也得出門，因爲，那樣，非特可避免了她的母親的勞叨，催促，撫愛的讉責，也可逃去那行將蒞臨的索債者的形形式式的面色。</p>
<p>被引進了客室中，一兩分鐘後進來的並不是她所欲見的席卓雲，而是他的太太。</p>
<p>「席先生出去了，陳小姐看他有什麽事情没有？」席太太問道。</p>
<p>出去了？不知怎麽她有些不相信。她想他是在樓上。</p>
<p>「事情是有的，」依娜不願意違心地說没有事，「可是我要同他對面說；現在旣然他不在，也就没有什麽了。」</p>

<p>棉市晨跌午回、但美棉續跌、發現新低價、因此人心虛弱、多頭了結、市盤下落、惟有一部份獲利者抵空、午後回漲、但日廠減工動議、日見嚴理、故市上現棉銷路異常冷澹、執貨者在近月套賣甚鉅、前途仍依外棉爲進退也、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈平軟之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥且有八分至一角之漲落、坎拿大好四分左右、惟開價後、市塲人心、依然不振、以各路實銷去胃、雖零星交易、尙見活絡、大批去化、則大寂寞、微聞天津現銷、本地占去一半、申粉祗達一萬餘、此種情形、實所罕見、人心之惡劣、當屬此故、迨至下午開盤、各月份市價、亦屬軟弱、本月份因交割已近、業外多頭、紛紛回出、遂又一角進關、遠期亦又帶疲、照目下局面、如果實銷不暢、雖不致大落爲難、漲則亦覺不易也、結果本月份跌一分半、四月份跌一分二厘半、五月份跌一分半、六月份跌一分七厘半、七月份跌一分、八月份跌七厘半、</p>
<h3 id="c245">期麥市場拋户密佈 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、一致見疲弱之象、本月份已經過去、四五月份亦無交易、惟遠期新麥、則人心已見軟化、雖各處春寒大雨、未免有碍麥苗、但以時令言、無甚關係、且以各廠之存麥、自政府麥全數售完後、新麥時期、需要必淡、更以粉銷之如是不振、故上下午各盤、拋户驟湧、價亦大落、結果六月份較跌六分、七月份跌四分、八月份跌五分、現麥因廠客互擯、未有做開、</p>
<h3 id="c246">南北米市紛紛下跌 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>▲滬南　昨日各帮來源四十餘號、（六千餘石）各路銷塲雖以天晴、反較栗落、因連日春雨、各帮乘貨積厚、作客心思未免稍餒、而售方有貨較夥者、莫不深求急脫、故市形雖活、實情已轉衰落、且兼時將月底、城鄕店胃暫停、常帮蘇同南港等粳行情悉難站定、較高者略疲五分、中關者竟削近角、杜洋尖亦受影響、故亦跟落角許、陰變元高者尙能站立、中次下落心許、各帮晚稻零胃淡泊、包胃續有動動、僅北洋天津威海衛等帮採取、南洋帮則停頓、故市况疲軟、幸北洋帮納意末衰、計進青角松泗西練等貨二千餘包、吃盤問題、賴以相持、致結果下降、參差不一、三五分六七分至近角不等、</p>
<p>▲滬北　昨日河下各帮到貨、内河已通、約到念餘號、惟銷路仍呆、白粳高貨定立、中次略小數分、羊杜尖白元價小三五分、薄稻小近角、埠客尖早稻陰元平定、</p>

<p>▲小絞八萬五千包···六元五角</p>
<p>▲客币浙閩續辦···市形轉站</p>
<p>昨日客币浙省溫州帮繼續辦裝、閩省福州多日未辦、昨因市價合劃到市繼續辦裝、因此市氣轉活、人心亦在望好中、到頭雖見續有、而以客化漸漸活動、後市當可暫時平站也、昨日福州辦去湖南機紅米四百包、價六元九角、又糙紅一百二十二包、價五元九角、此價比之日前所開價格、確已小去一角、價小合劃、此後或能引動客化、亦未可料也、溫州辦去南京陳秈與廠秈一千二百包、滁州機秈二百八十八包、價與前市相似、形勢亦稍見好、</p>
<p>洋米久見沉寂、數月來迄無大票做開、市上零星交易、大都爲本街回籠貨、蓋被客秈影響、市價亦久久不能起色、客帮更乏暢胃、故市上存底至今近二十萬之多、昨日由大成新豐兩米行向安利洋行談定小絞八萬五千包、因爲整票交易、價祇作六元半、比之市價爲廉、據說此批洋米已經行家配出一部份、</p>

<p>昨日黄豆來源尙見蟬聯、去路仍推廠家爲最鉅、其餘如本街出口等略有問津、難望有大批胃口、所以人心虛軟、挫跌一二分、昨售開碭山豆六百包、南河重二車、頴州豆三車、均爲廠家辦去、懷遠豆一車、肥河一車爲本街採去、又歸德豆三百包肥河豆三百包、爲出口去路、</p>

<p>▲紐約華絲有行無市　紐約各絲織廠、鑒於世界商市之不景氣、絲織品銷路日趨退化、類均减工停機、藉謀疎通積貨、生絲消費大減、更兼日絲濫跌傾銷、故華絲無人問訊、一般進口商手中囤積之黄白廠經、無法推銷、昨據本埠美絲商乾利洋行傳出消息、本月下半月紐約生絲市塲、華絲幾至有行無市、僅囤户售出Ｂ級白廠經八十一·二分匀度八千餘磅、每磅售價祗美金一元四角左右、扯合華幣每包不過四百八十餘元、</p>
<p>▲杭屬陳繭積極運滬　杭紹兩屬春蠶發動、新繭團瞬上市、一般餘繭客手中陳繭積極運滬、昨艮山門長安等站又有雙宮繭一百○八担運滬求售、</p>
<p>▲滬埠絲銷益呈疲靜　海外現絲價愈趨愈疲、各絲織廠需要益稀、而日絲積極濫跌傾销、供過於求、華絲無人過問、滬埠歐美各莊均觀望不動、内地各綢廠則均隨用隨購、銷胃寥落、且售價奇小、絲商虧蝕太鉅、碍難拋售、市氣益呈疲靜、絲銷前途已陷絕境云、</p>

<p>邇來五金交易、因客銷滯遲、市象十分冷落、雖同業方面竭力向廠家及建築帮等客户推銷、但終因環境不良致無進展之望、以此各市標凖逐步下游、惟馬口頭一項、因人心鞏固、故尙能擯持而不跌、計單連九十磅美貨估十五元二角半、一百磅十六元五角、雙連九十磅美貨估三十元零五角、一百磅三十三元二角半、英貨單連九十磅售十四元九角、一百磅十六元、雙連九十磅售三十元、一百磅三十一元五角、會司鐵二百磅老鋼廠售二十八元、又新鋼廠二十七元、交易尙覺良好、</p>

<h3 id="c272">文科多於實科 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>報載敎育部最近調製之二十一年度全國出國留學生統計，總數共爲五七六人，學習實科者二一三人，文科者三四二人，其中專法政者一七九人。（二一人未詳）我們細查這一統計表内，習文科者佔總數五分之三强，而專攻法政者佔總數約三分之一。</p>
<p>在這「復興民族建設國家」的呼聲茂囂塵上的時候，本應大有賴於精深幹練的專門技術人材，似乎中國留學學生之致力於理工科者，須呈激增猛漲之勢了，但是根據這一披露，竟自頭足倒置，實使人對此「復興建設」，感到深深的疑慮。本來中國之派遣留學生出洋，漫無計劃，實在是有失「爲國儲材」之意，同時這一般被譽爲洋狀元，以爲國家民族一展恒抱自詡的留學生，大部分不屬於冠蓋中的少爺公子，卽爲紈袴的豪華子弟，他們之遊歐土東瀛跑新大陸，就泰半爲的享樂，絕不以伏案埋頭來自尋苦惱。趨簡就易去選修文科，以此自愉，這原無所用其驚異奇怪，不過照目前中國情形看來，當不僅此一端，而象徵着下列的兩種意義··</p>
<p>第一，世界經濟不景氣的暗雲籠罩了中國整個大地，在其激盪之處，就無可或免的農村破産，商業蕭條，工業歇閉，加以戰禍連年，内亂不息，更弄得這地大物博的大國奄奄一息。復助以「三年不雨」從來未有的天災，使一切復興建設的美好計劃，成爲「可望而不可及」。所以有不少「學成歸國」科學人材，感到渺渺茫茫，英雄無用武之地。前車可鑑，因之許多「在三角形垂直綫」中找不到出路的人，乃改絃異轍轉而學習「治天下」大道的法政。留學生習文科多於實科者，卽這一社會動亂的反映。</p>
<p>第二，富貴錦衣，誰不想得。以前開科取士，許多四民之首的人都以錦繡文章爲入仕之途，可是而今時移事異，不懂得一點政治原是法典詮釋主義名詞之類，據聞難以爲政。在這一慾望支配之下，果然有不少的人，以學習法政，爲圖得列身部院之林的終南捷徑。留學生學習法政之特多者，想亦爲這種僥倖心理所誘致。</p>
<p>在以前「敎育神聖」的口號時，有些留學的科學人材，在「學」而無法「致用」之時，原可循「循環敎育」之例到學校免强担任敎職，可是而今不但認爲平淡生涯，且亦因并不神聖欲謀敎職而大非易易，這也是促成文科多於實科原因之一　　木屐朋友嘗詬駡我們非現代化的國家，政治不統一，可是現在我們有各國留學生三分之一的人在精研法政，何悉將來政治不上軌，全國統一丨丨何妨這樣答應。</p>

<p>太陽剛不見了！天空僅飄着一團一片的杏黄色浮雲，火車初停止在這裏車站。</p>

<p>天色漸的晚了！在車上僅吃過一次饅頭，晚飯是還没有吃的。還要走許多路是不得而知，到那兒宿營更不得知，卽至走過四五個鐘頭後，才到一個村莊。路上雖有點月色，可是在畸偶的山坡上，不時地踢着脚趾頭。</p>

<p>一刹那電光從我臉上閃過，有一個人和門口的衛兵講些什麽？接着便走進來射着電筒到連長室裏去。在微小的聲音中；他是找文書軍士，丨丨今夜兩點總攻擊，我們××團攻三陳莊。我心裏已感到不能再睡下去了！同時連長已呌傳令兵了！在我想着要起來時··値星官已吹哨子，値星班長也吹哨子，於是一陣地拦灰氈聲，咳嗽聲，刺刀掉在地上的聲，······馬上衝破沉寂的空氣。</p>
<p>恰好昨夜夫子跑掉三個，今天一天，連部裏的軍械子彈就是第一二排換着抬；現在靠不住輪阒我們第三排和四排了。</p>
<p>連長臨時下一個命令··着三四排找夫子八名，班長呌我和劉金標去找四名，「如果找不到，你兩個抬好啦」！</p>
<p>我最怕就是這些玩意兒，你呌我槍斃兩個人我容易，活跳跳拉幾人來受罪眞難找了。</p>
<p>然而這有什麽法子？拉不到自己去拿；但我一個人拿得也有限。一面走着，我心裏就是這樣想着。</p>
<p>走過幾家都是遇着些老太婆，有錢有人的當然早逃走了。「我知道；不關大門和没有大門的人家都不消進去」。</p>
<p>我這樣告訴劉金標。「好！這裏是有大門了」！他用脚踢過兩脚，接着用槍托衝破裂了它···我隨着他進去。</p>
<p>對着大門是没有門的堂屋，他看着裏頭走進去；我便站着四方打量一下。眞好；裏頭有男人發問的聲音了。我繼續進去；一個五十歲光景的老頭，披着衣裳開門出來；旁邊房裏出來兩個十七八歲的男孩子，王金標很客氣的河南話和他講；他們不敢反對，也不說不去的話，不肯定的站着打主意。······</p>
<p>講了許多話，他們照樣不陰不陽的；他氣極了送了兩個槍柄給他們，我也踢他丨丨老頭兩脚··</p>
<p>「替你們來打戰；請你們拿拿東西都不肯嗎」？我說。</p>
<p>他們很服從的走了；可是我心裏非常懺悔，我想起從前軍閥時候軍人在我們家鄕拉夫那些非人野蠻舉動，當時我們雖是小孩，是多麽的不平與咀咒啊！現在因爲環境嬲迫，公然這種不講理的野蠻舉動輪在我自身上來實現了！原因是環境造成的。</p>

<p>— 逸鷺</p>
<p>丨憶淮北丨</p>
<p>我離别了淮北，怱怱地回到南邊，不覺已成爲半年多以前的陳蹟了。在當時踏上歸途南下的辰光，原以爲僅僅十多天的隔離後就要相見的，誰能想到這竟似乎成了個無限期的訣别呢？以前我在淮北時所留下的一鱗一爪，恰如落花般的浮石流水上漂泊無踪，再不爲人們記憶得了；而淮北所給與我的一片片的印象，則至今還不時映演於我腦膜之中，且從未混糊過。淮北確是可愛，令我</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>流連忘返。一個不加時代修飾的天國裏丨天國要修飾何用呢？丨在在都顯現着的是靜的和諧，至尊！那兒的人，那兒的風尙，甚至一丘一流，一草一木，我無不具着十二分的虔敬，神聖視着，更無不覺得處處是專爲天國所特設的，否，我應該說是天國所獨有的啊！</p>
<p>淮北給我的印象實在太深了！但是······這决不是椿不好的事。誰不願對他所愛好的有一個深刻的印象呢？又誰不願於睡夢中瞻仰他所想見而不得見的愛好者呢？丨這盡是極好，我又何須如許憂慮我的觀點固執呢？我唯一覺得是快活的，就是在我每回想起了淮北的一瞬間，眼前環着我四周的一切事物，都漸漸地消逝了下去，竟至像什麽也没有，空空然只剩了我一個。</p>
<p>我總該記得清楚，在我初次走進淮北之一鎭的前年春天，正是她（淮北）被股匪蹂躪的時候。其時，彼地的居民正紛紛地在扶老携幼的逃命着，而我則提着行裝，踏上征途來到那裏最初的相識了她。</p>
<p>我已說過··我初次所到的是淮北的一鎭，一個小小的鎭。丨雖然，這小小的鎭以後帶我引見了淮北的一切丨那時候，這鎭裏什麽都似乎很平靜，（後來知道確實是平靜，並且一向很平靜着）後有股匪的足跡到過。我何幸？自己的身心寄托到一個無再比此如許平靜的天國裏來！但是，我將如何來描書這天國呢？我無能，縱使勉我的力，也必致流於凡俗。然則，永遠地讓她映演在我的腦膜中吧？那更不能，這會使我撫心不安。唉！太深的印象反致令我彷徨而不知何適是好！丨莫再猶豫吧！把那些一片片的零星記了下來再說，反正這都是天國所賜給我的。</p>
<p>這小鎭最早和我發生密切關係的當推那座土園丨一個完全用泥土堆成的城牆。</p>
<p>當我初到那裏的時候，相熟的人還不多，常是在早晨獨自一人走上圍去，閒步數十尋，或竟逗留半天。那上面滿地長着茸茸的小草，迎着日光，皆欣欣向榮。在牠們的中間讓出一條似隱似現的只够一人步行的小徑，我遨遊其上。時而仰首向天，則青青的穹蒼裏，一朶朶的白雲懶懶地從我頭上飛過；時而低頭看看脚下··有無小草被我殘踏了，則飛舞其間的小蝶兒，都繞着我身，像是驚訝這此地不常有人到的生客。我亦放長目光向遠處看去，則見一望無邊的綠綠的麥田，隨風波動，似大海的浪濤般向我滾滾而來。啊！一陣風將我的胸襟吹了開來。我向前走，可數十武，一列成行的柳樹卽映入我的眼簾··有的樹身已很粗大，有的還繊小。那掛滿着的柳葉兒令我想起拿牠們來比喩美人的腰的話，是多麽可惡。啊！這輩專會竊取自然的罪人啊！你汚辱了自然！丨我快活極了！我眞會疑作這不是人間。丨緣何要疑心呢？這原是天國喲！</p>
<p>我最愛柳樹，所以在土圍旁栽着柳樹的一處，我更愛去。記得有一次在夏間的一個下午，在附近那裏遇見芬，因爲正貼近圍下有一個很大很深的池塘，她正趕着一羣鴨子到彼覓食，鴨子在前面一搖一擺地走着，她在後面抬起了兩手，一邊嘴裏還作着噓噓聲地跟着。天啊！我眞不知怎樣來描摹那時的情景是好！實在太美妙了！</p>
<p>她跑上圍去，正是栽着柳樹的那兒。丨我應感謝天，她同我一樣也愛柳樹。她坐下了，於一株柳樹蔭下，我也走走上上去，聽見好說話了丨我何能把它來重復一遍呢？死板的文字再也不能把那時精神的生動表現萬一的。她說柳樹最合她的意，這廟的風影她最歡喜，她每回到此她來放一次鴨總得上來坐一回。她的話多啦！她每當說一句話轉到另一句話的時候，無不另換一種最恰當最自然的表情。她說··「我曾經幾次撫着心問自己··爲什麽一走上此處圍子上時，我的心就那麽安穩呢？」</p>
<p>關於那土圍的一切，現在又重新浮動在我的眼前。無恚吧？天國，芬姑娘！那柳樹的葉兒又該在掛起了吧！</p>

<p>而且，我們還知道，結婚是一種形式而已，牠亦同樣的是到了某一種社會制度發生後，才朋所謂結婚這個形式，牠本質上還是男女間必然的合理要求，不因爲結婚形式之如何而改變了牠的本質。只不過是在形式上點綴了些兒什麽色彩而已。在原始人類社會裏面，没有剩餘勞動發生的時候，各人都憑自己的勞力去尋求他們的一活資料，男女間的結合，完全純是一種合理的結合，無所謂像現社會這樣的再紛亂，痛苦不過的結婚後的悲劇，這都是明顯的事實。</p>
<p>而且，現社會的結婚生活，是不是完全是那樣悲慘的呢？亦不然，也較有較幸福的結婚存在。又更有些事實是！結婚後比戀愛時更愛好，這無論如何是一部分的事實，誰也不能够否認。所以問題是結婚固然不是戀愛的墳墓，但不良的社會結搆，給予了結婚以痛苦，然而我們不能因此而否定了本身是合理的結婚，消極的說結婚是戀愛的墳墓。我們同時亦不是像蕊珠女士那樣說，赤誠的心，無條件的相愛，就可以解决了現社會結婚後不良的毛病。因爲不合理的結果之因，不是在各個人的自己主觀意識的轉移，就能濟於事，乃是；因素藏在社會的基本結搆的底裏。所以任你如何良善的大呼我們不要以金錢，榮利爲結合的標凖，但事實上資本主義社會一日存在，新的合理的社會一日未出現，則終還有許多多以金錢榮利結合的標凖存在着，而且，會隨着迴光反照的臨終的資本主義之掙扎而更揚其毒舌，所以我上面說蕊珠女士只看到現象之面，而未能求得問題之根，空具一片勸人的婆心吧了。</p>
<p>於是，我們的結論是··找出了這個問題之根源，是要從社會的基本結搆的改造去解决。社會制度能移到合理的基礎上去，則結婚和戀愛就不會矛盾，而跟着一般的合理起來，更發展牠合理的本身。結了婚不僅不使以前戀愛的熱烈的愛情消失，而且更開着益加幸福的花果。回返到本來是無矛盾，無罪惡的戀愛與結婚去。</p>

<p>上海居，大不易，减租運動不發生效力，也盡人皆知了。一個二十元或三十元一月的小職員，房租恐怕要佔去全部收入的二分之一或三分之一。這樣說來，租小房子（面積小的房子）是最不容易；富有家財，而想租大洋房住的，那就最容易的事了嗎？前天我和朋友到滬西區沿街遍户的尋房子，雖有很好的建築，但不是光綫不佳，或竟是不適作住家用的。最後在邁而西愛路的西首，發現了一所Tolet的大洋房。待我們走前去的時候，一個大師傅模樣的人搖着頭說這裏不借中國人的！他活像電影中的丑角，滿臉的不願意樣子，說中國人三字也特别費力；然而他本人正和我們一樣都是黄族子孫的中國人哩！</p>
<p>外國人在我國的土地上造了房屋，就板起面也說不借中國人的。其理由當然是中國人是野蠻民族，無論什麽公共塲所，祇要中國人一至，就會弄得一塌糊塗，從前的公園門首「犬與華人不准入内」，也就是這個緣故。想想我們中國人眞是不可救藥，如今還在我們自己的國土上，被人家那樣的瞧不起。到外國去留學，自然時有被逼回國的可能。這有什麽可說呢，還有那輩像大師傳之流助紂爲虐。</p>

<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>＝米高梅公司被控影射＝</p>
<p>＝舊俄皇姪女追償損失＝</p>
<p>姚沙伯夫親王决計親自探訪頼斯蒲丁的危害是否屬實，便假意向他曲服，察出他荒淫無度，且懷着篡位的野心。頼斯蒲丁終日狂飲，以爲姚沙伯夫親王也在掌握之中，便將一切奸謀詭計告訴了他，甚至於把他對皇后的關係也和盤托出。他誇口說皇后不能丢了他，因爲他今天可以救活太子，明天便可把他置諸死地。他又說他决心要做全俄宰主。他並且以曾爲德國利用的秘密，親口告訴姚沙伯夫親王。他預定的陰謀是要沙皇遜位而以沙后攝政，這樣他便無異爲俄羅斯的太上皇帝了。</p>
<p>姚沙伯夫親王便與忠君愛國的臣僚密議此事。當時因沙皇在前綫親征，警察又無能爲力。他們决計要除此權奸，便由姚沙伯夫親王自行下手。賴斯蒲丁曾誇言他明知有人要暗殺他，但無人能傷他毫毛。姚親王便從一個醫生方面配了足以藥死二十人的毒藥，和入酒和酪之中。賴斯蒲丁是反一切酒和酪都吃了，但是絕無動靜，姚親王就慌了，便拿出手槍射擊，賴斯蒲丁飲彈倒地，好像是死了。不久他又活起來了，姚親王便再開一槍，並把他抛入河裏。事後，他被拘了放逐國外，他的夫人也跟了他去。他併流亡出國的時候，可說是身無分文。他們現在看了此片，不免觸景生情，追思着往事。</p>
<p>影片裏那泰夏公主和希哥狄夫親王訂婚就是他們倆當時的故事。賴斯蒲丁的前後種種拍得維妙維肖。而片中描寫那泰夏公主子同頼斯蒲丁也有關係，以及賴斯蒲丁到那泰夏公主那裏去，據原告律師稱實有影射公主曾爲賴斯蒲丁的情人的痕跡。</p>
<p>公主出庭的時候穿着元色外套，帽子也是黑色，面網蓋着她的眼睛，貂皮幃領裏，插着一束鮮花，愈加顯出她的妍麗。她說她住在她的母親那裏。被告律師問時，她說她是故沙后第二個姪女，她常往宮裏行走的。大戰發生時，她在德國，後來設法逃回俄國。她與賴斯蒲丁素昧平生，不過常常聽聞人家講起他。共産革命之後，她伴着太后從克雷米乘了英國兵船逃出。她看了影片，認爲那泰夏公主實是影射她的，而希哥狄夫則影射她的夫君。姚親王也是這樣的說，並指宮庭一幕，描寫那泰夏的窘境，實含着她同賴斯蒲丁發生噯昧之後，賴斯蒲丁有呌她不要聲張的意思。公主最後向庭上申說她凖備在奥，德，法，意，美等國也提出同樣訴訟云。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c281">評「懺情女子」 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ParoleGirl丨國泰丨</p>
<p>美國影片差不多有了一種共同的風向，無論如何，總得輕鬆明快，使娛樂的觀衆們在百二十分鐘的時光中，落得無憂無慮。因此，不管如何取材，卽使是相當眞實的也好，也得盡可能的使其趣味化，至於因趣味而空相的故事，那自然是更不待言。</p>
<p>這决不是偶然的現象。在美國有不少觀衆要求着Happyending，胡鬧滑稽，能够賣座，爲什麽製片家不應當極力適合他們的要求呢？</p>
<p>「懺情女子」也是屬於這一類的影片。</p>
<p>不管劇作者說明了那雪爾維的串騙是爲了父親的疾病，不管他也不能忽視社會的病態，可是這僅僅是爲了使那可憐的女郎穿插着一個頗有趣味的故事。</p>
<p>關於故事的本身，雖然它是展開了某一部份的社會現象，但是，也許有維持治安之職責者，將認爲是誨盜的罷。不是麽？它敎你怎樣行騙，它敎你怎樣在獄中舞弊。然而這片子是在公映着的，所以也就無話可說，也許因爲它是無聊的叙述，並不爲人們所注意。</p>
<p>的確，這是一部無足輕重的影片。平凡，庸俗，雖然你是看過了，可是走出戲院，你就會忘記了的。很明顯的，這因爲内容空虛的原故。由此可以證明，藝術作品，一定得有充實的内容，否則决不能使人感動。</p>
<p>關於這一影片，我眞覺得没有什麽好說。不管它是清順的叙述了一個故事，所謂表現手法也還純熟，可是這在技術十分發達的美國，又何足爲奇？</p>
<p>飾雪爾維的梅克拉克，總算演得還好。也許她便是哥倫比亞的台柱子吧？飾斯密士的拉夫伯勒孟，毫無可取，甚至於連稱職二字也够不上。</p>
<h3 id="c282">評「漂泊人生」 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 沙思</p>
<p>Pardners丨大光明丨</p>
<p>在銀幕上，也像在舞台上一樣，有天才的好演員固然能使那脚本的内容有更高而更有效果的表現，甚至能完成一種出乎作者意想之外的效果；但若脚本的内容太空虛了，這是會束縛好演員的天才，使他不能有充分發展的機會，結果就使他在那裏面的表演成爲平凡，毫無精彩的無生氣的扮演，一點創造意味都没有。就是有頂高明的導演者來導演，頂多也不過在許多小技巧上作出些小效果來，至於那主要的整個的效果（包含有演員的創造）還是不能挽救起來的。脚本不好，演員和導演人都是無用武之地的。</p>
<p>「漂泊人生」就是一個很明顯的例証。它不過是由一些偶然的無甚意味的事件凑合而成的，没有一定的中心，作者彷佛是想把司歌德丨賈克古柏飾丨的遭遇作爲中心來描寫，可是脚本的編製却没有充分地把握着中心，而導演的手法對於那樣的缺點又没有作努力的補救，結果「漂泊人生」給予人們的印象是没有一定的中心，没有統一的效果。</p>
<p>還有，本片没有先將司歌德的家庭狀况丨卽他父親的困苦和他的孤單很具體地表現出來，這對於以司歌德的遭遇作中心來描寫，實在是一種損失，因爲作者如同情地把它具體地表現出來，在全劇的發展中是能加强司歌德的效果的，這樣一來，也就加强了那中心的表現而使其更見顯著有力了。可是作者和導演者却並不這樣做。</p>
<p>此外，如那鬥牛的穿插，特别是那在鬥牛塲中杜白看見他的逃妻和其情人，實在是太偶然了，這對於全劇的發展，中心的表現是没多大的益處的，不過是增加片長而已，其實像這樣空虛的作品也只好利用這樣偶然性的穿插來完成··這在目前歐美的電影作者大都是這樣的製作影片。</p>
<p>「漂泊人生」的幾位重要的演員都很稱職；只可惜限於脚本的内容和導演者的缺乏創造的才能，又因手法不高明，致使他們没有精彩動人的表演；特别是賈克古柏，在本片中，他的表演的才能更受拘束。</p>

<p>Wu Jingheng Delivers Speech, Striving to Realize the Bequest</p>
<p>He Yingqin Reports at the Beiping Military Branch on the Martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial service for revolutionary martyrs at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Wu Jingheng, Fang Juehui, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Jia骅, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Chaojun, Li Zonghuang, Li Jingzhai, Li Ciwen, Deng Jiayan, Gan Naiguang, Xiao Jishan, Chen Shuren, Gu Zhenggang, Kexinge, Fu Rulin, Wang Qi, Hong Ludong, Duan Xipeng, Chen Ce, Huang Fusheng, Xiao Zhongzhen, and representatives from all staff and various institutions, totaling over 600 people. Wang Zhaoming presided over the ceremony, led the salutations, and presented wreaths. Afterwards, Wu Jingheng delivered a report, stating that the spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs was heroic and their character was great, which is known to all and need not be repeated. Speaking only of the small matters, what they sacrificed was nothing more than the desire to realize the ideals of the Premier, namely, that people should use their talents to the fullest, land should be used to its greatest advantage, materials should be used appropriately, and goods should circulate freely. However, now, twenty-three years have passed since then, and the Premier's bequests have not been realized. How can we shirk responsibility? In commemorating the revolutionary martyrs, we should strive to realize the Premier's minimum demands. Furthermore, the so-called talent is not limited to the scholar-officials and higher-class figures, nor does it mean that all people in the country should become higher-class figures. It is necessary to ensure that all farmers, merchants, and workers possess intelligence. All people in the country should awaken amidst the current advocacy of the New Life Movement and strive for reform. I believe that in twenty-three years, the country will be strong. It must be understood that the world will be unable to achieve peace even after twenty-three years, or even two thousand three hundred years. We must strive urgently and not err again. It is hoped that all people in the country will rise up together and catch up to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven. After his speech, it was already 10:00 AM, and the ceremony concluded.

<p>(Beiping) At 10:00 AM on the 29th, the Military Branch held a memorial service for the martyrdom of the Huanghuagang martyrs. Attendees included He Yingqin, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Zou Zuohua, Wei Yisan, and hundreds of staff members. After the ceremony was conducted according to protocol, He Yingqin reported on the circumstances of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs. His original speech was as follows: "Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. I would like to briefly report to you on the following points: (1) The tragic facts of the martyrs' martyrdom: On March 29 of the year before the founding of the Republic, comrades such as Huang Xing and Zhao Sheng, acting on the orders of the Premier, launched another uprising in Guangzhou, aiming to overthrow the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty in one fell swoop. Unfortunately, the plan was not kept secret, and it failed again. Revolutionary martyrs were arrested on this day, and a total of seventy-two people were executed on the same day. Because the situation was chaotic at the time, the names of most of the martyrs could not be verified, so they were buried together at Huanghuagang at the foot of Baiyun Mountain in Guangzhou. In that year, the Xinhai Revolution broke out. (2) The great significance of the martyrs' martyrdom: The uprising of the seventy-two martyrs dealt a major blow to the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty and opened up a path to freedom and liberation for the entire Chinese nation. Their spirit of sacrificing themselves generously for the country served as a wake-up call to the sleeping Chinese nation, awakening them from their deep slumber and leading them together to a new and bright path. The success of the Xinhai Revolution in one fell swoop was based on this event. (3) My personal thoughts: The Chinese people are accustomed to knowing only how to benefit themselves and not knowing about the country, and the concept of selfishness and self-interest is extremely strong, while the concept of the country and the nation is very weak. The seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang did not hesitate to sacrifice their personal lives in order to seek the freedom and liberation of the country and the nation. This spirit of sacrificing the small self to protect the greater self is truly worthy of our admiration and respect. If only the soldiers and citizens of the entire country could have the determination and courage of the seventy-two martyrs, move forward bravely, and work hard diligently, I believe that the freedom and liberation of the country and the nation will certainly be achieved in the near future."

<h3 id="e28">The Expansion of the Western Border Crisis (II) <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>England</p>
<p>丨Observed from the French Perspective丨</p>
<p>The crisis on China's western border has been briefly described as above. However, in addition to the British, the attitude of the French is also noteworthy. Although the French do not have very blatant aggressive actions, we, the Chinese people, must be vigilant about the signs.</p>
<p>According to a foreign telegram earlier this month, the French believe that my country's Xisha Islands (approximately located at 110 degrees east longitude and 16 degrees north latitude) are the necessary route for the summer and autumn monsoons to attack Annam. My country cannot establish a weather station here, resulting in not being able to make preparations in advance. It is necessary for France to occupy them, etc. The Xisha Islands have always been my country's territory. The land is very close to French Annam. The French have been paying attention for more than a day. Our country's authorities once planned to construct an observatory on the islands, on the one hand to facilitate maritime travel, and on the other hand to prevent the coveting of those with wild ambitions. It was delayed due to internal chaos and was not realized, giving the French an excuse to have the intention of occupying the island. Their ambition is not only to establish an observatory. This is one matter. Back in April of last year, the French government formally published an official gazette, announcing the occupation of nine coral islets between French Annam, British North Borneo, and the American-led Philippine Islands (approximately located at 115 degrees east longitude and 10 degrees north latitude). At that time, it caused great attention from various related countries in the Far East. Taking the islands with very little economic value and seizing them as their own by sudden means, it is no wonder that the Chinese people suspect that they intend to control my country's maritime rights in the South China Sea. This can also be viewed in conjunction with the claim to advance into the Xisha Islands. This is another matter. Furthermore, France's power in the Far East has always been based solely on Annam. Therefore, they feel even more necessary to complete their control of maritime rights in the South China Sea. We can see that France has not returned Guangzhou Bay to us after renting it, as the British did with Weihaiwei, to implement the Washington Conference declaration, which is enough to prove this. If the management of Guangzhou Bay leads to the fertile land of Leizhou and Hainan (Guangzhou Bay is east of the Leizhou Peninsula) and the magnificent port of Yulin (at the southern tip of Hainan Island, where the Baltic Fleet of the Russo-Japanese War once anchored) all falling into the grasp of French power, then the fall of the nine small islands and the Xisha Islands today is still a small matter compared to the troubles on our southwest border.</p>
<p>However, the French are not only engaged in maritime rights, but also in the expansion of their continental policy. Looking at the colonial undertakings they are engaged in in Annam, the most important thing that we cannot ignore is that they have built the Yunnan-Vietnam trunk road from the coast of Tokyo Bay along the Red River basin to penetrate the hinterland of Yunnan, and have also built roads with Hanoi as the center to reach the Zhennan border of our Guangxi Province, which proves that they have connected the transportation between the entire Vietnam and Guangxi Province. At present, the economic lifeline of Yunnan Province is already in danger of being controlled by the French, and Guangxi Province will also feel deeply uneasy. This is one aspect. Since renting Guangzhou Bay from us in 1898, France placed the management of the area under the Governor-General of Annam in 1900. With an area of 200 square miles, the current population has reached 200,000. All municipal transportation, commercial, and financial undertakings are under the full control of the French, and they have also obtained the right to build roads from the Leizhou Peninsula to the interior, and our promise not to cede the southern provinces, France already has the situation to control half of our southwest. This is another aspect. All of these things may be baseless worries on our part, but "preparedness averts peril" is an ancient teaching. At a time when the great powers are competing fiercely for the division of colonies in the Far East, can we who look back at the western border not feel uneasy about it?</p>

<p>Boli - News of Manchurian police attacking the Chinese Eastern Railway schools, clubs, and libraries has been pouring in. According to a report from Railway Bureau Director Ludi to the Railway Administration Department, the Central Library of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been closed by the police, and White Russian officials serving in the detective team frequently enter the premises for inspection. Therefore, the unity and tranquility of this unique type of cultural treasure is under threat. The police continue to attack railway clubs along the line. It is known that the establishment of these cultural institutions is based on agreements concluded with the railway authorities. These agreements guarantee that railway employees have full access to their schools, clubs, and libraries. Therefore, the aforementioned actions of the Manchurian police are clearly illegal. Today, a message was received from Harbin stating that Soviet Consul-General to Harbin, Slavutsky, has again contacted Manchurian negotiator Shi Luben, strongly requesting an investigation into the situation of Soviet citizens arrested and detained by the railway police. Acting negotiator Shimamura notified Soviet Deputy Consul Trepinsky that ten arrested Soviet railway employees have been deported. Trepinsky strongly protested this deportation, calling it an unreasonable act by the Manchurian authorities, and firmly demanded the immediate release of the remaining arrested personnel.

<p>(Tokyo) - Foreign Minister Hirota, based on his proposed concord diplomacy, in addition to engaging in direct negotiations with the US government, is also employing so-called national diplomacy, using visits by politicians, scholars, and literary figures to further enhance Japanese-American goodwill. The politician deemed most suitable for the first visit to the US is Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Speaker of the House of Peers, hence he is being strongly encouraged. Recently, Duke Konoe has been moved by the enthusiasm of Foreign Minister Hirota and the government, and has decided to travel to the US. He is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the steamship Asama Maru on May 17th, traveling to the US as a private goodwill envoy. He will first visit his son in the suburbs of the United States, then travel to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt, conveying the goodwill of the Japanese people towards the United States. He will also visit major cities, meeting with prominent figures from all sectors of American society, striving to enhance friendly relations between the two nations. He is scheduled to return to Japan in early September. (Dentsu dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Issued Specifically in Response to Roosevelt's Statement</p>
<p>Disarmament Must Not Hinder National Defense Security</p>
<p>US Naval Proposal Deemed a Blank Check</p>
<p>Cannot Build Ships Without a Decided Budget</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - When President Roosevelt signed the Vinson-Trammell Act for naval construction, he stated that the next disarmament conference would further expand the current limitations and hoped that all nations would unanimously reduce armaments beyond the current levels. In response, the Japanese naval authorities issued a statement saying that while Japan agrees with the overall reduction of armaments, it absolutely opposes reducing them based on the current ratio system. The Empire will demand the abolition of the current ratio and that its sense of national security not be threatened. Therefore, a condition must be that countries with high levels of armament reduce their armaments first in order to achieve the goal of disarmament. Japan's national defense policy has always been aimed at not attacking other countries and not being invaded by other countries, and is therefore based on establishing a completely independent national defense. (Dentsu dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Japanese government issued the following opinions on the US naval construction plan and its statement: (1) The US intends to maintain the existing system at the 1936 conference and further reduce the naval strength of various countries. However, Japan will determine its attitude within the scope that national defense is not threatened in any way. (2) The Japanese Navy still insists on breaking the existing ratio system, and Japan is determined to oppose extending the limitations on capital ships until 1941. (3) The US shipbuilding plan has not determined its funding, so it should be considered a blank check and can only be used as a bargaining chip for the 1936 conference. (4) The Japanese Navy will adopt a defensive principle and will propose a concrete plan at the 1936 conference. (China United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Security Guarantee Issue</p>

<p>Disarmament Core Members Decide to Hold Meeting as Scheduled</p>
<p>France Successfully Courts Belgian Diplomacy</p>
<p>(London) - According to sources in Paris, the opinions of Britain and France on the main problem, namely the security issue, are now gradually converging. The French side now acknowledges that the security issue is reduced to a guarantee for the implementation of future disarmament conventions. The French ambassador to Britain has stated to the British Foreign Secretary that France acknowledges that this guarantee for the implementation of disarmament conventions is limited to Europe, including Russia. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Barthou is currently drafting a document to answer the British Foreign Secretary's inquiry regarding what kind of guarantees France needs. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) - Foreign Secretary Simon and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson discussed the disarmament issue. The British government believes that countries are exchanging opinions on this matter, and wants to wait a little longer before convening a small committee of chairing nations of the Disarmament Conference. Henderson argued that the meeting should still be held on April 10th as originally scheduled, saying that he has no right to decide on a postponement. In the end, the two agreed to maintain the original plan, and Henderson will notify the League of Nations Secretariat in Geneva by telephone to prepare for the April 10th meeting. Regarding the guarantee layer in the implementation of the disarmament convention, if the scope is delineated geographically, then the United Kingdom may not object. What the British Cabinet wants to understand clearly is the clauses in the British disarmament plan regarding French or German armaments. To what extent France can accept them. The Cabinet believes that if France has a clear expression on this point, then those in the Cabinet who embrace British isolationism may agree to Britain providing new promises. In other words, if Paris is willing to reduce French armaments to the quantity specified in the British plan, and is also willing to grant Germany the benefits stated in the British plan, then Britain can change its unyielding isolation policy, and the basis for a general agreement can be established. The opinions of the British people are roughly like this. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - According to reliable sources in official circles today, Belgium has unconditionally accepted France's request, opposing any plan to reduce French armaments or recognize German rearmament. The two countries made this decision after consultations between their foreign ministers. Recently, French Foreign Minister Barthou visited Brussels, in a hurried manner, because since the accession of Belgium's new monarch Leopold III, the traditional alliance between France and Belgium has been shaken from time to time. Barthou's trip to Brussels was to stabilize this precarious situation. It is said that France's diplomacy on this matter has been victorious. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Parliament Will Be Dissolved if Not Passed</p>
<p>Cabinet Decides on Implementation Methods</p>
<p>Civil Servants Protest in Succession</p>
<p>(Paris) - French Premier Doumergue said today in his response to the debate of those who support the devaluation of the franc that he will dissolve the French Parliament. Premier Doumergue means that if Parliament does not pass the Cabinet's spending reduction plan, he will dissolve Parliament. The purpose of this spending reduction is to balance the national budget, with a total amount of around 4 billion francs. Regarding the dissolution of Parliament, Doumergue said that he will appeal to the people against the devaluation of the franc. Premier Doumergue's reform plan stipulates the layoff of 40,000 government officials, but these officials occupy a significant force politically. The reason why Parliament is procrastinating and dare not authorize Premier Doumergue to show a sweeping reduction in staff is because of this concern. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - According to confirmed information here, the Doumergue Cabinet has decided to rigorously implement spending reductions, with approximately 80,000 people to be dismissed, and the remainder to have their salaries reduced. As a result, civil servants of the Socialist Party and others met in the Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday to discuss a strong protest, which will be formally announced at the General Confederation of Labor on Friday. However, the Doumergue Cabinet has decided on the following measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure: (1) Reducing the salaries of current officials by 5% to 8%, which can save 300 million francs. (2) Reducing 80,000 officials, which can save 1 billion francs. (3) Reorganizing tax collection and abolishing many "special tax exemptions," which can increase revenue by approximately 1.6 billion francs. (4) Extending the years of grace, changing the age of 45 to 50, and the age of 55 to 60, which can also save 700 million francs. )5( After abolishing various subsidies, 400 million francs can be saved. In this way, 4 billion francs can be saved annually to meet the government's needs. It is reported that it will be announced next week. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>World Trade Statistics</p>
<h3 id="e41">Only Japan Sees an Increase in Imports and Exports <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) - According to the Board of Trade's publication of world trade statistics for 1933, among the eighteen countries that occupy a major position in world trade, only four countries saw an increase in their total value of imports compared to the previous year (1932). The largest increase was in Japan, with its total value of imports increasing by 34% compared to the previous year. This is due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen. The second largest was the United States, with its total value of imports increasing by 9.5%. This is also due to currency fluctuations. As for the total value of exports, eleven of the eighteen countries increased compared to the previous year. The largest increase was still in Japan, with an increase of 34.2% compared to the previous year. The reason is the same as the reason for the increase in the total value of imports, namely the depreciation of currency. The smallest increase was in the United States, with an increase of only 0.7% compared to the previous year. However, the average price of US export goods last year was slightly lower than the previous year, so although the total value of exports increased, the total tonnage of exports actually increased by 20% compared to the previous year.

<p>Parliament Overturns Veto</p>
<h3 id="e42">Major Blow to President Roosevelt <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Pension Act Ultimately Established</p>
<p>Future of the Budget Bill Unpredictable</p>
<p>(Washington) - After President Roosevelt vetoed the bill to increase the amount of veterans' support and allowances, and to re-raise the salaries of officials, the Senate and House of Representatives successively decided to maintain the original bill with a two-thirds majority. After the results of the Senate's vote today were announced, the President's veto was ruled invalid, and this law was thus established. From the perspective of the President's position in relation to Congress, this cannot be said to be a serious failure, and the burden on the national treasury will also increase as a result. Yesterday, when the Senate voted, those who advocated maintaining the original bill and opposed the President's veto accounted for two-thirds of the senators, including 29 Democrats, 33 Republicans, and 1 Farmer-Labor Party member. Those who supported the President's position and opposed maintaining the original bill totaled 27, all of whom were Democratic senators. This was the situation of the vote. As for the content of the law, it stipulates an increase in expenses of $1,250,000,000, re-raising the already reduced salaries of federal officials, and making it retroactive from February of this year. It also stipulates an increase in expenses of $1,030,000,000 to restore the veterans' support that has been canceled. The total of the two numbers is $2,280,000,000, which is the expenditure to be made in the first year after the implementation of the law. The expenditure in the future will be much higher than this number according to the law. The fact that Congress has now passed a bill vetoed by the President has given rise to the feeling that Congress is resisting the President, and the speed of its second vote is even more surprising. From the time the President signed the veto message to the time the two houses successively voted to maintain the original bill, the time elapsed was only thirty hours. The atmosphere was very tense during the Senate discussion today, and the audience was packed. When Vice President Garner (i.e., the Speaker of the Senate) announced the voting results, the entire audience cheered and applauded thunderously. Before the vote, the leaders of the majority Democratic Party did their best to get the party to support the President, especially La Follette, who contributed the most. However, the result was that the Senate was swept by an anti-Presidential trend and could not support it. The Senate's psychology is that Roosevelt's power is equal to being completely unrestrained, so it must pass this case to warn the President and to express the independent nature of the Senate. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The New York Times said in today's editorial that Congress's overturning of President Roosevelt's veto was a blow to President Roosevelt himself. The House of Representatives has always been a friend of President Roosevelt, and now this move has caused President Roosevelt to be hurt by the House of Representatives. The New York Dispatch said that the subsidies poured out by President Roosevelt have put him in a vulnerable position, but President Roosevelt's measures are not wrong, which is a fact. Now President Roosevelt's failure on this issue only shakes the people's trust in the government. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) - The quiet atmosphere of the exchange market before the holidays was disturbed by a sudden surge in the pound sterling. The values of the franc and the dollar both fell. The development in France regarding staff cuts and salary reductions at the end of this week has created a buying trend for the pound sterling among the French. As for the dollar, although its international exchange rate is weaker than before, the franc-dollar exchange rate has only fallen by two centimes. The weakness of the dollar is the result of Congress overturning President Roosevelt's veto. According to some opinions, the general public has doubts about the future elections, fearing that people in Congress will arbitrarily plan for currency inflation in order to attract votes, so they have flocked to buy pounds sterling. Congress's overturning of the President's veto is the first major blow that President Roosevelt has suffered since taking office. This case will cause changes in the budget bill, and to an extent that is difficult to predict at present. How President Roosevelt will respond to this is currently uncertain. It is found that the US gold reserves now total $700,000,000,000. For every three dollars lent out to its affiliated banks, the Federal Reserve Bank holds one dollar in gold notes. And the affiliated banks, having borrowed one dollar from the Reserve Bank, can lend out ten dollars. Therefore, the credit expansion of $700,000,000,000 can reach approximately $2,100,000,000,000.

<p>Does Not Allow International Banks to be Exempted from Security Deposits</p>
<p>Deep Dissatisfaction in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) - The US authorities are now refusing to cooperate with the major powers in financial matters, and are not allowing banks in Basel in the United States to be exempted from financial gold collateral, as the bank was established to coordinate international affairs. Washington's attitude has caused deep dissatisfaction in international financial circles here. It is said that the US authorities have a lack of vision and an overly stubborn attitude. In the future, international banks will not be able to bear the amount of US collateral, and the US's cooperative efforts with Basel banks will be greatly reduced. This issue was raised at the London Economic Conference, but the League of Nations does not seem to have clearly recognized the Basel Bank as an organ of the League of Nations. Currently, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan have all made efforts to prohibit the outflow of assets of banks within their territory, whether in wartime or peacetime. The US attitude is very firm. It is said that the reason is not protectionism, but that the US cannot allow this exceptional request today, because President Roosevelt has banned the circulation of gold. The United States cannot change this principle, at least for the time being. In the future, as time passes, there may still be a possibility of reconsideration. Observers say that the United States will wait until its financial policy, after the new experiment is completed, and will be able to interact with other countries again. Under this serious situation, the international community has unanimously paid attention to the issue of this guarantee, because this move can make the bank's position more secure, and in the event of war or disaster, this money can be used as international capital. The Basel Bank was established in 1930 to handle international economic affairs as a principle. Its president is the American Mr. Neumans, and its position is no different from a banking association, as many world financial leaders discuss international financial issues here.

<p>Conflict Between the National Defense Force and the Party Army</p>
<p>(Berlin) - Although Hitler has implemented dictatorial politics since taking office, in reality, government orders on various major issues in internal affairs and diplomacy are not uniform. For example, regarding military and political issues, conflicts between the Commander of the National Defense Force and the Chief of Staff of the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung, Röhm, are inevitable. People in the National Defense Force are unwilling to have the existence of the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung, and Röhm is working hard to organize a Nazi Party army to compete with the National Defense Force, eventually leading to the National Defense Force being annexed by the Party army, so they are extremely dissatisfied. The feelings are expressed in words. Also, the Stahlhelm Party, led by Seldte (German Labor Department), which had already merged with the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung, has now decided to separate again. This matter has a major political nature, and its intention is probably to weaken the power of Röhm, the Chief of Staff of the Sturmabteilung. Hitler did not prohibit this matter, which shows that he undoubtedly approves of this move. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) - The Heavy Industry Committee's organ newspaper Industrialization Report analyzes the economic rivalry between Japan and Italy, pointing out the increasingly fierce competition in the sale of cotton textiles between the two countries, the competition between the two countries' silk, rayon, and silk fabrics in the US market, and the infiltration of Japanese goods into the markets of North Africa, the Near East, and Southeast Europe (which Italy regards as areas dominated by its economic power). The newspaper continued, "The expansion of Japanese economic power fundamentally harms Italy's interests in some places, so the newspaper enthusiastically carries out its campaign against the dumping of Japanese goods. Mussolini's speech also made threatening shadows towards Japan, but Japan, amid the growing dissatisfaction of various European countries with the competition of Japanese goods, is unwilling to bow down and retreat, without a bloody battle. Therefore, the contradictions between Japan and Italy will inevitably become more acute." (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) - The Liu bandits rested west of Donglidian, northwest of Yishui, on the 28th, and are still fleeing eastward today. Yishui County Magistrate Zhang Liyuan telegraphed that the bandits had reached Shuiyuanping, eighty miles northwest of the city. Han (Fuju)'s negotiating team and Ning Chunxiao's brigade of militia pursued the bandits and had minor contact northwest of Yishui. Because the bandits were being pursued so urgently by government troops, they did not dare to stay for long, so large villages were not breached. The encircling troops all reached their destination tonight and will immediately launch a general offensive against the bandits. Because it is feared that they are not just roving bandits, it has been decided to annihilate them within a short period of time. They originally wanted to return to their old lair in Mengshan, but they were unable to do so because there were already troops in Mengyin. Nine members of the Liu bandit gang have been arrested, including Chen Yunsheng. It is rumored that he is Liu's chief of staff, and his clothing is luxurious. He confessed that he was formerly a member of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army, and was recruited by Liu to serve as a secretary. His family is in Tianjin, and he is willing to surrender, using his family as collateral, and serve as an informant to suppress Liu. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers carried a piece of news from Rome. The March issue of a new Eastern monthly publication there stated that the former Turkish prince Abdul Kerim had written to the Cairo-based Al-Mokattam newspaper, recounting the difficulties he encountered during his travels in various parts of the Far East. The Turkish prince expressed his dissatisfaction in the letter, saying that as soon as he arrived in Tokyo, newspapers spread rumors that Japan intended to build a Muslim empire in Turkey, and that the Turkish prince denied these reports by vaguely stating that if Japan truly wanted to realize this plan, they should find a patron older and more experienced than him. For example, his father would have been a good choice. According to the Cairo newspaper, the Turkish prince immediately pointed out that princes of the Ottoman royal family would be very useful if they could participate in the rising "Turkish Liberation" movement, because they have the traditional authority of imperial concepts. In the letter, the Turkish prince was extremely angry at the Turkish diplomatic representative in Japan for protesting his activities there. Judging from several statements in the Turkish prince's letter, there is little doubt that his plan includes using Xinjiang as a base for an active anti-Soviet conspiracy. (28th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) The Henan Provincial Relief Association telegraphed Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Minister Kong, and Standing Committee Member Song on the 27th, requesting urgent spring relief for Hua County, stating briefly that the disaster in Hua County was severe, unprecedented. Although the breaches have been blocked, food and housing are still lacking. Water accumulates in the fields, making planting impossible. The dry land has all turned into quicksand, which cannot be restored in a short time. At this time, at the beginning of spring, when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are waiting to be fed. If the Central Investigation and Relief Office is ordered to close, and the spring relief is rushed through, the refugees will surely starve to death.

<p>Kailuan Labor Strike</p>
<h3 id="e62">Mediation Gradually Maturing <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Mediation Committee Established in Tangshan</p>
<p>Miners Submit Twelve Demands to the Bureau</p>
<p>Bureau Feared That Dongsi Mine Would Follow Suit and Seemed Unlikely to Agree Quickly</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan miners submitted twelve demands to the Kailuan Mining Bureau. The main points are to restore the labor-management cooperation contract of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), which stipulated: (1) All workers inside and outside the Kailuan mines will receive an eight-cent raise on their original wages; (2) Increase bonuses for outside workers and the number of tons of coal provided by the mine each year. Four cents per ton will be given to all outside workers in the mine, but each person must receive at least fifteen yuan per year. Outside workers above ground will be temporarily set at twelve yuan per person. If they are converted to inside workers, they should enjoy the same treatment as inside workers. Tao Shangming mediated on the 28th with worker representatives, the head of the Public Security Bureau, Zhao Xun, and representatives of the gentry. Considering that four cents per ton was too much, he proposed that the mine give each person an annual bonus of more than fifteen yuan and less than eighteen yuan, still using inside workers as the standard, with outside workers receiving incremental increases. The workers have already agreed, but the mine is afraid that if it accepts this condition, the Dongsi mine will also make similar demands, so it has not yet responded. The Tangshan striking workers have no food expenses, and on the 28th, workers forced contractors to lend them thousands of yuan to maintain themselves. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Public Security Bureau has fully prepared the compensation for deaths and injuries of Kailuan workers and deposited it in a certain bank. It will be distributed in two or three days. Other conditions are still under negotiation.

The Public Security Bureau believes that there are many lawless elements, so martial law is still enforced at the original time every day. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received in Guangzhou today, a severe typhoon struck the coast of Huiyang on Monday night, causing the sinking of about 800 people into the sea. At that time, more than 300 sailboats and sampans were anchored near the Haifeng border and were suddenly blown away by the typhoon and sank into the sea. Most of the dead were fishermen and their families, because they were tired from working during the day and the families were sound asleep, unexpectedly swept away by the typhoon and waves. A customs patrol boat nearby, with British officers and sailors on board, rescued a small number of survivors and recovered many floating corpses. Judging from the bodies of the fishermen, it can be seen that the victims were still huddled together for warmth in the small boats when the disaster struck, as it was very cold that night. The rescue team witnessed various tragic scenes, including the floating corpse of a Chinese girl, still holding a kitten in her hand. Her mother, who was fortunately rescued, still wanted to find a way to get her daughter's body out of the water. The hands of the corpses were all tightly grasping wooden boards and bamboo poles, indicating that they were still trying to save themselves in the emergency. (29th National Telegram)</p>

The strength in prices is mainly attributed to the revival of inflationary sentiment. Trading was sluggish, but the upward trend after the opening was subtly unfolding. It is expected that the pre-holiday quiet will fill today's market. (The following is a report from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.)

<p>(Changsha) At the expanded memorial week yesterday, He Jian reported on the bandit situation, stating that the Xiao and Gao bandits originally had over ten thousand men and about six to seven thousand guns. After two months of relentless pursuit, they have been repeatedly attacked and are in a state of utter disarray, having exhausted their ammunition. Currently, the Gao bandits have only about seven to eight hundred guns left, and the Xiao bandits have only a little over a thousand. Many officers and soldiers of the pseudo-regiments and companies have surrendered in recent days. In the past half-month, it has been reported that our army has captured about eight to nine hundred bandit guns, and local militias and volunteer corps have captured about a thousand bandit guns. Most of the remaining guns have been lost, scattered along the way, or buried by the bandits in various places. Orders have now been given to all armies to thoroughly search to prevent harm to the local population. The Xiao and Gao bandits will soon be completely eliminated.

<p>=Bandits Retreat towards Jianning and Qingliu=</p>
<p>=Northeast Two Routes Advance Towards Western Fujian=</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the 3rd and 6th Routes of the Jiangxi Northeast Route Army and the Fujian Northern Bandit Suppression Army recovered the counties of Shaxian, Yong'an, Jiangle, Shunchang, and Taining, they continued to advance towards Guihua, Qingliu, and Jianning to suppress bandits. The goal is to clear out the red bandits in northern Fujian in the shortest possible time, complete the blockade line and defense arrangements between eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian, and then, together with the Southern Route Army, launch a three-pronged attack on the pseudo-central areas of Tingzhou, Liancheng, Ruijin, and Huichang. According to front-line news from the Northern Route Army, certain units of the National Army attacked and advanced from Jiangle and Shunchang towards Guihua. The pseudo 7th Army Corps, 19th Division, and the Independent 7th Division in Guihua City, due to the rapid advance of the main force of the National Army and the presence of the National Army stationed in Jiangshunyongsha, which formed a tripod with Guihua, feared being surrounded. Starting from the 22nd, they began to retreat towards Jianning and Qingliu, leaving only a part to fight against the National Army in the Longhu area northeast of Guihua to cover their retreat. On the morning of the 23rd, a certain division advanced from Tiecenguan to Longhu and engaged in battle with about a thousand bandits. The bandits fought and retreated. At noon, the National Army recovered Guihua City, and the remaining bandits fled west of Guihua to join the bandits retreating to Jianning and Qingliu. After the division entered the city, in addition to leaving a part to defend the city, another part advanced westward, had passed Lintuo, and reported the situation of the recapture of Guihua to the headquarters on the 23rd. It is said that after the recapture of Guihua, Jianning was surrounded by the Northeast Two Route Armies, and the recapture is also not a problem. (March 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Six Columns to Suppress Liu's Bandits <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>=Han Personally Assumes Command and First Column=</p>
<p>=Issues Proclamation Offering Reward of 10,000 Yuan for the Capture of Liu's Bandits=</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Liu Guitang's remnants crossed the Jinpu Railway near Wandeful on the 24th, they took the road to Laiwu and Xintai, fleeing towards Mount Meng in the hope of returning to their old lair at Baodugu. According to official reports, Liu's bandits reached the Laiwu county border on the 25th, numbering about seven to eight hundred. Zhan Shutang's unit, Yun Qichang's brigade, and the 74th Division, Ma Guanyi's brigade, are in hot pursuit. Xie Shuxian, commander of the Southern Shandong militia, also led his troops overnight to Mengyin to intercept them. He also ordered the militia joint defense associations of Xintai, Laiwu, Mengyin, Sishui, Tai'an, and other counties to mobilize and intercept them. The scattered bandits in western Shandong, Feicheng, Wenshang, and Dongping are being cleared by the militias of the respective counties. Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, came to Jinan from Yanzhou on the afternoon of the 25th to meet Han and report on the bandit suppression process. In order to thoroughly eliminate Liu's bandits, Han decided to launch a large-scale encirclement. He summoned Sun Tongxuan, Gu Liangmin, Liu Shuxiang, and others to discuss and determine a concrete plan to eliminate Liu's bandits, which mainly involved drawing eighteen regiments from various divisions, dividing them into four directions to suppress them, forming six columns, each with a commander and three regiments. Han himself assumed the position of commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression army and commander of the first column. Sun Tongxuan was appointed commander of the second column, Cao Fulin was appointed commander of the third column, Gu Liangmin was appointed commander of the fourth column, Li Hanzhang was appointed commander of the fifth column, and Zhan Shutang was appointed commander of the sixth column. The bandit suppression armies from each direction were scheduled to depart from the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways to their destinations on a specified date, awaiting the order for a general offensive. It is rumored that Sun Tongxuan is advancing east from Yanzhou, Zhan Shutang is advancing east from Tai'an, Cao Fulin is advancing south from Boshan, Li Hanzhang is advancing southwest from Ju County and Zhucheng, Gu Liangmin is advancing north from Zaozhuang and Linyi, and Han himself will lead troops south from Weixian, forming a large encirclement. It is expected that Liu's bandits can be wiped out in the shortest possible time. At 9:10 PM on the 25th, Gu Liangmin left Jinan and led his troops forward. Cao Fulin led his troops south from the Jiaoji Railway nearby. Sun Tongxuan was also scheduled to return to Yanzhou on the 26th to lead his troops to suppress the bandits. Han Fuju will first go east to a certain place in the coming days and then turn south to supervise the suppression. According to Gu Liangmin when he left Jinan at the station, this time Liu's bandits infiltrated Shandong Province. I led the direct subordinate units of the division headquarters and Ning Chunxiao's unit of the 64th Brigade, together with Sun Xuefa's regiment of the 20th Division of Commander Sun, Jiang Boyuan's regiment of the 74th Division, Li Xuande's cavalry regiment, and Gu Liangyou's militia of the 3rd Route, and Xie Shuxian's militia of the 4th Route, to track and encircle the bandits, and engaged in five fierce battles with them. The first time was at Longguji and Taipingji in Juye, the second time was at Dinglichang (Zhuangmin) (Liuguantun) in Yuncheng, the third time was at Jinkou in Dongping, the fourth time was at Daxiaokaoshan in Feicheng, and the fifth time was near Huangshan in Jieshou, especially the battle at Kaoshan was the most intense. The number of bandits originally reached three thousand, and after several fierce attacks, the casualties were definitely not small, and most of them were defeated. The remaining bandits, who fled east across the Jinpu Railway, were no more than five or six hundred, already in Laiwu, etc.</p>
<p>Liu Jin, the magistrate of Feicheng County, reported to Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, on the 25th that Liu Guitang had been bombed to death during the fierce battle in Feicheng. Other sources have no definite proof. It is also heard that Han Fuju has separately telegraphed the Central Government and Chairman Jiang of Nanchang, and Minister He of the Beiping Ministry of Military Affairs for verification of the daily bandit suppression process and future elimination plans.</p>
<p>Also, according to news received by the headquarters this morning (26th), the remnants of Liu's bandits have now fled to the Luxi Town area in the northeast Laiwu territory of Tai'an and continue to flee. The number is only seven to eight hundred, and there are no more than three to four hundred guns. Yun Qichang's brigade and Ma Guanyi's brigade are working hard to pursue them. The captured bandits were sent to Jinan for interrogation and were mostly from the Northeast. They said that Liu Guitang himself wore a gray cotton robe and brought two yellow horses, alternating riding them, and was extremely fierce. Han launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of Liu's bandits, starting today, and specially stipulated the temporary regulations for bandit suppression: those who capture Liu Guitang will be rewarded with 10,000 yuan in foreign currency, and those who kill him will be rewarded with 6,000 yuan in foreign currency. On the one hand, a notice was also prepared and sent to various counties for posting. The notice reads, "It has been found that Liu Guitang was previously entrenched in Nanshan, burning, killing, and looting, and the local area was devastated. This chairman cherishes the people and sent a large army to severely suppress him, and then took the power to appease him, hoping that he would repent and do good. However, the bandit's ambitions are difficult to tame, and he rebelled and fled without reason, disturbing several provinces. He has always been like a rebel, and recently led bandits from outside the Guan to return to southern Shandong. I mourn for my fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters, who will inevitably suffer further destruction. I am willing to lead the military and civilians of the entire province to rise up and suppress the bandits. The orders are strict, and military law is strict. In addition to ordering all armies to strictly abide by military discipline and love the local area, six articles of the temporary regulations for bandit suppression are hereby promulgated, which should be strictly followed. This notice." Temporary regulations for bandit suppression: (1) Those who kill Liu Guitang will be awarded 6,000 yuan in foreign currency, and those who capture him alive will be awarded 10,000 yuan. (2) Those who achieve outstanding results in bandit suppression will be heavily rewarded. (3) Those who seize bandit weapons will be heavily rewarded. (4) Those who protect villages or report accurate bandit information will be appropriately rewarded. (5) Those who supply the bandits with weapons, ammunition, food, or those whose guns are seized by the bandits and fail to prevent it will be severely punished. (6) Those who collude with bandits, harbor bandits, or delay reporting bandit information, or even abandon cities and villages, will be held jointly liable, and the heads of the township, district, town, and county will be punished. Han also issued an order to all subordinate troops to print and distribute seven articles of the temporary regulations for bandit suppression: (1) Strictly obey orders, earnestly suppress bandits, and those who achieve outstanding results will be heavily rewarded. (2) Those who capture Liu Guitang will be awarded 10,000 yuan in foreign currency, and those who kill him will be awarded 6,000 yuan. (3) Those who seize a large number of bandit weapons will be heavily rewarded. (4) Those who linger and fail to advance, delay military opportunities, or withdraw without authorization in violation of orders will be severely punished. (5) Those who disturb the local area or demand supplies without paying will be severely punished. (6) Those who leak military secrets will be severely punished. (7) Those who corrupt military discipline and morality will be severely punished. For the above seven articles, rewards and punishments for senior officers will be determined by the commander-in-chief, and for junior officers, the respective commanders will report for approval at any time.

<p>The County Government Has Already Deployed Militia to Defend the City</p>
<p>Zhang Fang Will Go to Nanyang to Supervise the Suppression</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Western and southern Henan have always been areas where bandits are rampant. A month ago, after Liu Guitang's bandit unit crossed the Yellow River and fled, Wang You's unit of more than two thousand men also fled back to Lushi and Song County from the Shangnan area of Shaanxi. Ma Xiyou, Xiao Liushao, Fang Dashen, and other units roamed the Deng County and Neixiang areas. South of the Yellow River, there were traces of bandits everywhere. Later, Liu Guitang's bandit unit was driven out of Henan, and Wang You's unit was also almost completely wiped out by Zhang Fang's unit of the 20th Route Army. Ma, Xiao, Fang, and others fled into Yunyang in northern Hubei. The bandit problem in Zhongzhou seemed to be on the verge of being resolved. Unexpectedly, recently, Shi Jianbin, Tu Laiyuan, and other units of more than seven hundred men have re-disturbed the Zhengyang and Xi County areas, and incidents of kidnapping occur every day. Ma Xiyou, Wang You, Xiao Liushao, Fang Dashen, and other units have also returned to Wan County. Zhang Fang telegraphed Bian on the 25th, stating that according to a telephone report from Wang Tuanfu of the 457th Regiment, Ma, Wang, and other bandits had infiltrated the area east of Caodian in the east of the county at 10:00 PM on the 24th. His regiment launched a night attack, killing dozens of bandits and capturing several rifles. One officer and fourteen soldiers of his regiment were wounded or killed. After being attacked, the bandits split into two groups, one fleeing northwest and the other fleeing east. He is currently pursuing them, and he will personally go to supervise the suppression within days to ensure their annihilation. Also, a Ye County dispatch stated that Wang You and Ma Xiyou joined forces, leading about three thousand bandits, and fled north from Fangcheng to the Xiaobao'an area, more than fifty miles south of the city, plotting to disturb the old county, thirty miles from the city. After being blocked by the 3rd Squadron of the Baoan and the Strongman Team, they turned east, detoured north, and showed a tendency to attack the city. In addition to the artillery battalion of the 20th Route Army and the Baoan Team stationed in the city, the county government feared that the strength was insufficient and has transferred several hundred militiamen from the 1st and 5th districts to defend the city and assist in the defense.

<p>=Accompanied by Thunder and Rain=</p>
<p>=Followed by Spring Snow=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the two earthquakes in Wuhan on the 18th, followed by a violent hurricane on the 20th, the climate has been unusually changeable. When it is hot, people feel that wearing a lined coat is too much, and when it is cold, even heavy fur coats are not warm enough. On the evening of the 27th, thunder was first heard, shaking the roofs. At that time, the sky and earth were dark, and the rain poured down. The low-lying streets and alleys were deeply flooded. At 11:00 PM, the storm struck again, blowing off tiles, destroying houses, and causing sand and stones to fly. The intensity was as fierce as the hurricane on the 20th. The city's electricity was cut off more than ten times, and telegraph and telephone services were also mostly interrupted. After 3:00 AM on the 28th, it gradually subsided. At dawn, heavy spring snow fell, and it was even worse at noon. Large snowflakes flew around, as big as palms. The indoor temperature dropped to 48 degrees Fahrenheit, as if it were midwinter. It is said that a giant thunder on the 27th struck a large ancient tree on Black Mountain in Hanyang, which was ten times as thick as a hug. A giant snake inside was also electrocuted. The storm also destroyed many houses. A large number of wooden boards were found on the river surface, which seemed to be ship materials, suggesting that there must have been many shipwrecks in the upper reaches of the Xiang River.

<p>Reporter Inspection Team</p>
<h3 id="e100">Arrives in Kangding from Ya'an <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Crossing High Snow-Covered Mountains</p>
<p>People Eagerly Await Central Government's Attention to National Defense</p>
<p>Ya'an, February 26th: Departing from Ya'an to Western Sichuan for inspection, sometimes using sedan chairs, which served as embellishments on the long journey. The only other figures on the long road are a few farmers carrying goods and the coolies carrying tea. Regarding the tea carriers, men, women, old, and young are all involved. The amount carried depends on their strength. The maximum is thirteen packages, each weighing seventeen catties, totaling 221 catties. They rest every few dozen steps to conquer this long journey of thousands of miles. The inconvenience of transportation, the difficulty of transport, and the suffering of the people can be imagined. On the same day, they traveled eighty miles and arrived at Rongjing County. The county is named after the Rong River and the Jing River, and its area is sixty miles east to west and one hundred sixty miles north to south. It is rich in copper, iron, and coal mines, but agricultural production is insufficient. There is only one high school for boys and one for girls in the county seat, and education is not very developed. On the 27th, they traveled from Rongjing to Huangyibao for rest, only forty miles, because from here they had to climb the Daxiangling, which required a day's work, so they had to spend the night at the foot of the mountain. However, even at the foot of the mountain, the altitude was already 1,400 meters (above sea level). On the morning of the 28th, at 6:00 AM, they went to Huangyibao and braved the rain to climb Daxiangling, a mountain road of forty-five miles. After traveling ten miles, the rain turned into snow, and the accumulated snow became higher and thicker, and the temperature became lower. In a silver world, everything was white. In order to travel faster, the reporter gave up the sedan chair and walked, feeling warm due to the effort, and not fearing the ice and snow. At 2:00 PM, they reached the highest peak, called Caoxieping, and turned downhill. The road was steep and narrow, so it was shortened to fifteen miles. The accumulated snow turned into icy scales, and they fell and got up again, rushing down. After traveling another five miles, they arrived at Hanyuan County. The wind was strong, worthy of the name Qingfeng Ya Yu (Clear Wind and Elegant Rain). (Hanyuan was originally called Qingxi.) Having crossed this 2,900-meter-high Daxiangling, they did it in one go, so it was still early. After a brief meal, they continued their journey, traveling another twenty-five miles to Hanyuanchang for accommodation. This market town is the largest in Hanyuan County. Because its trade is closer to Western Sichuan, the market is bustling and commerce is prosperous. The Hanyuan essence is gathered here. A middle school is also located in this market town. There are four high schools in the county, and education is relatively developed. On March 1st, due to the fatigue of the porters, they rested in Hanyuanchang to regain their strength. On the 2nd, they left the market town and traveled seventy-five miles to Datouzhen. This place is the ancient Feiyue County, located at the foot of the Feiyue Ridge. The land is barren, the people are poor, and the population is sparse. In the Qing Dynasty, the county was abolished and turned into a town. After the restoration, it was changed to a sub-county, belonging to Hanyuan, and a county assistant administrative office was established to handle local affairs. They went to bed early that day and set off early on the morning of the 3rd, climbing Feiyue Ridge again. The ice, snow, and climate of this mountain were no less than those of Daxiangling, but there were more mountain paths, making it easier to walk. Reaching its peak at 2,910 meters, it was ten meters higher than Daxiangling. The boundary between Sichuan and Western Sichuan Provinces is divided by this mountain. Going down the mountain from here to the west, they entered Western Sichuan Province. They rested at Hualinping at the foot of the mountain, a sub-county of Luding County. There is also a county assistant office. The population is very small, with only dozens of households in the entire town and only a few hundred households in the entire township. On the 4th, they traveled dozens of miles and arrived at Luding County, the easternmost county in Western Sichuan. From Hualinping to Luding County, the barren mountains stretched endlessly, the soil was dry and loose, and the grass was withered and the trees were sparse, which was completely different from the land of Sichuan Province. However, the mountain range formation contains a lot of minerals, but unfortunately no one pays attention to it. The county covers an area of 120 miles from north to south, and is narrower from east to west. The population is four thousand households, with more than 30,000 people. There are three high schools and one normal school. The main product is medicinal materials, and very little farmland has been reclaimed. Fifty miles from the city, Lengqi has a hundred acres of flat land, which is the largest farmland in the county. However, nineteen percent of the property rights are illegally occupied by French Catholic priests. The Catholic Church is outside the county seat, with tall foreign buildings, and its power can manipulate the rural economy of the entire county and control officials and people. On the 5th, they left Luding City, crossed the iron-linked suspension bridge, crossed the Luding River (formerly known as Xiaojin River), traveled sixty miles, and rested at Wasigou. On the 6th, they traveled another sixty miles and arrived in Kangding at around 4:00 PM. After entering the city, there were slogans all over the street, earnestly requesting the central government to resolve the Kang Tibetan disputes, and eagerly hoping that the financial and industrial circles would develop the treasures of Western Sichuan. The authorities chose the office of the Panchen Lama in Xijing as a reception center. Tang Ying, commander of the Xijing Tuntian, and Deng Xiang, brigade commander of the Sichuan-Western Sichuan border defense army, came to visit and reported in detail the truth about the Kang Tibetan military disputes and the tragic situation on the front line. These national defense soldiers, in the icy and snowy weather, lacked food, ammunition, and clothing, and resisted the Tibetan army. Many died in the war due to hunger and cold. It was tragic to hear. Also, the rear soldiers seen in the Kangding market were also very pitiful in their hunger and cold. During their six-day stay in Kangding, in addition to holding meetings to welcome them, private visits by people from various agencies, legal groups, gentry, merchants, and civilians were also numerous. They all eagerly hoped that the central government and the people of the country would pay attention to the national defense and development of Western Sichuan as soon as possible. Also, because Kangding is inhabited by both Han and Tibetan people, the educated people of Western Sichuan and Tibetans living in Kangding also came to welcome them, hoping that the people of the whole country would help. On the 13th, they left Kangding and returned east. On the 16th, they arrived at Huayang. According to the original plan, they began to return to Ya'an along the new road at Hualinping. This road was newly opened and completed, except for crossing a mountain near Hualinping, it can bypass the high mountains of Feiyue and Daxiangling, and the road is flat and the scenery is beautiful. Once this road is completed, it will be very convenient for those entering Western Sichuan in the future, as they will not have to trek through the two high mountains that pierce the clouds. Also, traveling along the new road takes six days, saving two days compared to the old road. On the 19th, they returned to Ya'an and decided to take a bamboo raft along the Ya River to Jiajiang on the 21st, climb Mount Emei, transfer to Jiading, follow the upper reaches of the Yangtze River downstream, and return to Chongqing via Xufu, Luzhou, Hejiang, and Jiangjin to inspect the situation in southern Sichuan.

<p>The Court Issued Summonses Twice</p>
<p>Gu Renfa Expressed Willingness to Appear in Court</p>
<p>The case of the former Chief of the Second Public Security Bureau, Liu Zhuomin, and his wife, Wen Rongzhen, resisting transfer and obstructing official duties, and involving the wife of the Director of Civil Affairs, Gu Renfa, and her daughter, Li Shuyun, being detained by the local county court, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the county court has issued summonses twice, ordering Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. More than twenty women from this county, including Zhang He and Xu Deyin, expressed indignation at Li Shuyun's arrest and jointly sent a letter of condolence to Li Shuyun. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Submitted Eight Pieces of Evidence After the Li Shuyun case occurred, the Director of Civil Affairs, Gu Renfa, believed that Li Shuyun's crimes were related to the national principles. If national laws could not be applied to close relatives, how could officials be rectified and examples set for subordinates? Therefore, he telegraphed Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, requesting punishment. The original telegram stated: "If I do not abide by national laws, how can I govern the people? The law should not spare relatives; let me be the first to abide by it. Lax family governance is inexcusable." Yesterday, Director Gu collected eight pieces of evidence related to the Li Shuyun case and submitted them to the Provincial Government for transfer to the local county court for investigation.</p>
<p>Gu Renfa Decided to Obey the Summons and Appear in Court The Procuratorate of the local county court previously telegraphed Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. However, Gu had gone to Jiangxi and had not returned, so he could not come to Wuxi. The Provincial Government replied with a telegram to inform them of the situation. Now, the Procuratorate has learned that Gu has returned to the province, so yesterday, they issued a summons for the second time, ordering Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. It is heard that the summons will be delivered today. Director Gu Renfa stated that the case must be handled according to judicial procedures. If it is legally required for him to appear in court, he will immediately go to Wuxi. Therefore, it is expected that the Director may obey the summons and surrender himself.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Issued a Strange Letter The other day, Director Gu used the Department of Civil Affairs' Order No. 3 to instruct the local county government to forward it to the county court. The content mentioned a letter to Director Gu, signed by Wu Chahua, Zhou Zhengwu, and Chen Jianzhi, recounting Li Shuyun's background, which was described as very humble and sordid. It also stated that Li Fengqi, a member of Li Shuyun's clan, was originally in the countryside, acting as a guarantor and gentry, but had no knowledge. He spent 700 yuan to seek a position as Chief of Public Security Bureau, etc. Upon inspection of the original letter, there were many doubts. It cannot be determined whether Wu Zonghua and others are real people. However, Director Gu's willingness to marry this Li Shuyun is even more suspicious. Now, the local county government, upon receiving the order, has forwarded it to the county court's Procuratorate for verification.</p>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau Hosted Reporters Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Director of the local county Public Security Bureau, the Director of Academic Affairs of the Police Training School, Yu Die'ao, and Inspector Huang Bingnan, hosted a conversation with correspondents from various newspapers at the Washington Hotel. Huang Bingnan distributed a passage of Director Gu's speech that had been printed. He said that this text was sent to Wuxi this morning by a special envoy from the Department of Civil Affairs and delivered to the Department of Civil Affairs inspector in Wuxi, Zeng Binqiu, who instructed them to forward it. He also repeatedly emphasized that the Liu Zhuomin resistance case and the marriage dispute between Gu and Li were two completely separate matters and should not be linked in the reports. Subsequently, Yu and Huang hosted a Western-style meal at the hotel's Western restaurant, and the guests and hosts parted on happy terms.</p>
<p>Li Will Present a Defense Against the Statement Yesterday (29th) at 5:00 PM, reporters visited the detention center to inquire about her condition. According to the doctor who examined Li Shuyun, Li Shuyun's condition had improved compared to the previous day. She ate some rice porridge, but she still did not feel hungry. In the morning, Li also vomited a small amount of fresh blood. Li stated that she intended to present a defense against the statement published by Gu Renfa.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Tax Evasion Case Trial <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Xu Jigong, the director of the local slaughter tax collection office, passed away a long time ago. Now, two important staff members of the office, Lian Shaoshan and Gu Yunpeng, are secretly acting as agents. Lian and Gu have been embezzling funds, totaling five or six thousand yuan. The details are recorded below: (1) The supplementary tax collection for three and a half months from June to September of the 21st year actually received around 12,000 yuan. However, Lian and others reported the amount to the Provincial Education Funding Management Office as 8,708 yuan, and later reported that only 6,785.77 yuan was received. The embezzlement amounted to around 4,000 yuan. (2) The local education surcharge was more than 2,400 yuan, but Lian and others only remitted more than 1,000 yuan, embezzling more than 1,000 yuan. (3) The local construction surcharge was more than 1,200 yuan, but Lian and others only remitted more than 500 yuan, embezzling more than 500 yuan. In total, the embezzlement amounted to more than 5,000 yuan. A local resident, Mao Jinshan, filed a complaint with the county court's Procuratorate. Yesterday was the court hearing, but Lian and Gu did not appear in court. Mao Jinshan requested that they be arrested and brought to justice. The prosecutor in charge approved the request and adjourned the court. It is also heard that the county education bureau has ordered the office to remit the short-paid funds to the bureau by a specific date. If there is further delay, they will present the case to the county for arrest and pursuit, to safeguard education funds and emphasize public funds.</p>

<p>Zhang Peishen, chairman of the Wuyi Pawn Industry Association, and others stated that according to newspaper reports, the Shanghai Bank's new plan to regulate agricultural finance this year intends to establish farmers' mortgage loan institutions similar to pawnshops. In addition to mortgaging agricultural products, clothes, jewelry, and utensils can also be pawned, so that farmers can borrow small amounts of money at low interest rates whenever they need it. Trial operations are already underway in Jiangning and Dongtai, and it is planned to gradually promote them in the future. They believe that this will hinder the pawn industry and cut off the livelihoods of workers. They have drafted relief measures and sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Pawn Industry Federation, requesting that it be submitted to the general meeting for discussion and resolution on April 16th. Yesterday (28th), they also sent letters to the pawn industry associations in various counties, urging them to unite and fight together. At that time, representatives will be sent to attend, jointly appeal, and maintain the industry.</p>

People put on fur coats again. The spring harvest will be affected.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Four New District Chiefs Announced <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The local autonomous administrative region was originally divided into fifteen districts. Now, according to provincial orders, in order to save expenses, it has been merged into eight districts. The boundaries of each district have now been redefined and will be implemented on April 1st. All the old district offices will be closed by the end of March. The selection of district chiefs will be made from the original fifteen people, strictly selected, and submitted by the county to the province for approval. News has been received from the province that four people have been announced first. The first district chief is Shen Changjun, the second district chief is Lu Wanrong, the fifth district chief is Xu Jingyu, and the seventh district chief is Zhu Qingnan. The remaining four are still under consideration.</p>

<p>Yang, the captain of the third detachment of the Haining tax police, stationed at Xiaoputuo in Haining, usually condoned his subordinates to harass people everywhere in the name of searching for smuggled salt. They privately took chickens and ducks from villagers and moved objects, which they sold in the Dadongmen area. Local people have complained. Recently, the Chunxi Town Office in the first district of Haining organized the screening of a movie to raise funds for road repairs. The detachment leader, along with many relatives and friends, went to watch the movie the other day. They were wearing uniforms and had no badges. They forcibly wanted to enter but were unsuccessful. They rushed back to the detachment headquarters and led the entire tax police force to swarm the area. They first opened the gate and ordered people to be beaten upon sight and objects to be destroyed upon touch. The order was disrupted, and countless viewers were trampled and injured. Among those beaten and injured by the tax police were Qian Yueqing, the secretary of the chamber of commerce, and Huang Tinggui, the ticket seller. Their heads were broken and bleeding, and their injuries were severe. They have now filed a lawsuit with the county court for injury verification. Local legal organizations, believing that the detachment leader was so barbaric and harassed the people, were extremely indignant. The Haining County Chamber of Commerce, Property Association, Women's Association, and other legal organizations have telegraphed Chairman Lu of the Provincial Government, Director Feng, and Team Leader Zhang, requesting severe punishment according to law to ensure local peace and uphold the law. It is heard that Director Feng has sent someone to investigate the truth and take action accordingly.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiucheng, the young owner of Zhang Baoyuan Silver Shop, residing in Beizha, Wuzhen, was kidnapped by bandits on the evening of the 18th of this month on his way home from the shop. His family noticed and searched everywhere, but his whereabouts were unknown. Zhang was once blackmailed and taken home. Negotiations were conducted at the Shanghai Xinhuizhong Clan Hall, but the price was too high and no agreement was reached. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jiucheng was hidden in a house at No. 108 in Jiaxing. On the night of the 27th, he escaped during a conflict with another accomplice. He reported to the business office for voluntary security defense. Team leader Hu Feiqian, along with members Li Zhankui and others, and the Public Security Bureau's wooden gun team, went to the house that night to search, but there was no trace of the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e108">On the Draft Constitution (Continued) (Zhang Yuanruo) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(5) The National Assembly</p>
<p>(1) In critiquing this chapter, there is a crucial premise that cannot be ignored: is the National Assembly a constitution-making body (PruvoivConstitucot) or an organ generated based on the constitution (PruvoivConstitucotc)? Article 51, Paragraph 4 of the draft constitution stipulates the "formulation" of the constitution, indicating it is a constitution-making body. Therefore, its existence should precede the constitution. However, other articles indicate that its organization and functions are all defined by the constitution, suggesting it is generated by the constitution and its existence should follow the constitution. How should we interpret this contradiction? To resolve it, the constitution should either not include provisions on the organization and functions of the National Assembly, or delete the word "formulation" in Article 51, Paragraph 4. One of these must be chosen for consistency in legal principles and facts.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the organization of the National Assembly in Article 47, we find four unsatisfactory points: 1. The electoral system still suffers from the drawbacks of the traditional representative system, making it too outdated. This extreme form of localism is not only out of step with the times but also makes it difficult to select true talent. 2. The population of each county varies, but each elects one representative, which is unfair. Moreover, the number of counties in our country is not small, resulting in too many representatives, causing many obstacles. The division of electoral districts in other countries does not entirely use existing administrative districts as a standard. To correct this, refer to Chapter 10 of the Russian Constitution (Note 6). 3. After representatives are elected, if they are unqualified or incompetent, they should be subject to recall by the people. The constitution does not provide for this, so it should be supplemented. 4. National representatives bear significant responsibilities and sacred missions, but the only qualification restriction is age, which seems too superficial.</p>
<p>(3) Since the National Assembly is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, it should be clearly defined as the highest organ exercising the power of governance. However, the functions prescribed in Article 51 do not fully align with this purpose. This is one contradiction. According to Article 69 in Chapter 7, the President and the five Yuan are responsible to the National Assembly. However, the Assembly lacks provisions on budget approval, votes of confidence, policy inquiries, and recognition or ratification of war and peace, and amnesty. How can the Assembly exercise its power to supervise the government, and how can the government be held accountable to the Assembly? This is another contradiction. Furthermore, the number of attendees and voting requirements for the Assembly are not specified, suggesting a neglect of national affairs.</p>
<p>(4) Moreover, the use of the veto power has no precedent in our country, and the people lack experience in it. The constitution lacks detailed regulations on the methods, procedures, and scope of application of the veto power, which will create difficulties in its application in the future. This should be noted and supplemented in advance. With the National Assembly meeting only once every three years, this veto power will not only be insufficient to remedy legislative tyranny but will also be equivalent to a mere formality. A way to correct this should be sought.</p>
<p>(5) The establishment of the National Committee is a good idea and a practical provision tailored to local conditions. Given China's vast territory, large population, and the public's limited political knowledge and capabilities, the National Assembly may become unwieldy. However, according to Article 54, the powers of the representatives of the National Assembly end on the day of adjournment. Yet, Article 55 stipulates that members of the National Committee are not limited to representatives of the National Assembly, suggesting that its organization is not sound, as it cannot fully inherit the governing power of the nation.</p>
<p>(6) Furthermore, Article 58 stipulates that the National Committee has more real power than the National Assembly. Entrusting such significant powers and responsibilities to such an unsound and small organization not only violates the principle of popular sovereignty but is also dangerous in practice. First, the constitution does not specify to whom the members of the National Committee should be accountable. If they abuse their powerful position and take regressive measures, there will be no recourse. Second, if there is a conflict between the powers of the Assembly and the Committee, how will it be resolved? This is also not mentioned, and it will inevitably lead to disputes in the future. It is hoped that this will be carefully considered and amended.</p>
<p>(6) The Division of Powers Between the Central and Local Governments</p>
<p>How to divide the powers between the central and local governments varies among countries around the world. Since the Republic of China, contemporary scholars have debated fiercely, advocating either centralism or provincial autonomy. The boundaries of powers have not been clearly defined, leading to frequent turmoil. Article 60 of the draft constitution reconciles these views and adopts the principle of balanced powers, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. However, Dr. Sun only provided the principle of balanced powers without concrete regulations. The so-called national consistency and local adaptation are abstract and lack specificity, requiring further in-depth research.</p>
<p>Examining the legislative principles for dividing the powers between the central and local governments in various countries, the central government typically enumerates its powers, while the local governments have a general scope. However, the content of the central enumeration is complex, and the legislation of each country varies. The advantages and disadvantages of each system differ significantly. (1) According to the US Constitution, the powers of the central government are divided into two types: exclusive powers, which are exercised exclusively by the central government, and concurrent powers, which can be exercised by the states until the central government acts, after which state laws become invalid. The remaining unspecified powers are reserved to the states. This is a unique feature and advantage of the American system, as it allows the central government to thoroughly and effectively exercise its powers in all states, while also allowing the states to fully develop their autonomy. (2) The German Constitution enumerates the powers of the central government, distinguishing between those exercised exclusively by the central government, those belonging to the central government but exercised by the state governments on its behalf with central supervision, and those for which the central government only has supervisory power. The drawback of this system is that the central government cannot directly and effectively exercise its powers in the states. (3) The Austrian Constitution enumerates three types of powers of the central government: those for which both legislative and executive powers belong to the central government, those for which legislative power belongs to the central government and executive power belongs to the local governments, and those for which the power to set principles belongs to the central government and the power to execute and elaborate details belongs to the local governments. The drawback of this system is that the legislative and executive powers are not consistent, preventing the central government from effectively exercising its powers in the provinces, similar to the German system.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems. However, when making our choice, we must use the historical political problems of our country and the current political needs as the standard for our selection. The most prominent defects in our country's past politics are twofold: one is that the powers of the central government cannot be thoroughly exercised at the local level, with each province acting independently and orders not leaving the capital; the other is that local autonomy has not been effectively promoted, and the people's political knowledge and capabilities have not made significant progress. Therefore, the greatest need for our country at present is to centralize power and promote decentralization, enabling the central government to thoroughly and effectively exercise its powers in all provinces to achieve national unity, while also providing constitutional guarantees for local autonomy to promote its development. This is the unique strength of the American system and the direction that our country should take at present. Evaluating today's draft constitution in this light, we believe that the provisions of Article 61 are too weak, and the matters it lists are too complex. In our view, the exclusive powers of the central government should be limited to the minimum necessary, but they should be strictly enforced by the central government, and the provinces should not be allowed to overstep their authority. As in Article 1, Section 10 of the US Constitution, there should be strict provisions prohibiting states from doing certain things. This is one point. Furthermore, among the items specified in Article 62, such as household registration, security and public order, education and culture, hygiene and epidemic prevention, transportation, and forestry and fisheries, it seems appropriate to assign them to the provinces. Another item could be added below Article 61, stipulating the concurrent powers of the central government and the provinces. When the central government does not exercise these powers, they can be delegated to the provinces for execution in accordance with the spirit of Articles 130 and 136, but once the central government exercises these powers, the laws of the provinces become invalid. This is one point. Furthermore, "local" in Article 62 of the draft constitution should exclude the provinces, so what are the provinces supposed to do? There are no regulations, and it is necessary to supplement them.</p>
<p>Article 63, concerning military administration, is too simplistic and does not address the specific circumstances of our country. Military interference in politics is the greatest problem in our country, and the constitution should include concrete and effective provisions on the deployment of troops, the allocation of military expenditures, the storage of military equipment, the punishment of soldiers, the restriction of military dictatorship, and the proportions of various military branches, in order to fulfill the original intention of national constitution-making and achieve the effect of restoring order and correcting chaos. Secondly, financial issues are also closely related to the unity and peace of our country, so the division of taxation should not be based on vague clauses but on the nature of taxes, with concrete and clear regulations to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p>(7) The Central Political System</p>
<p>How to create the central political system is a significant matter that deserves special discussion. Now, I will only add some criticisms to the constitutional text.</p>
<p>(1) The National Government Article 69 of this section stipulates that the President and the five Yuan are responsible to the National Assembly. However, the President in Section 2 of this chapter is merely a figurehead with no real power. It is unreasonable to hold someone accountable who has no power, as it goes against the principle of balanced powers and responsibilities. Moreover, if the President does not bear any real responsibility, then where does the responsibility come from? This is another legal contradiction. As for the Yuan being responsible to the National Assembly, the National Assembly only meets once every three years and is often in recess, so this so-called responsibility is merely a formality. Article 71 states that the National Government commands the army, navy, and air force. However, the National Government is a diverse organization with no single leader. To whom does the power of command belong? The constitutional text does not specify this, which seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>(2) The President Article 77 only sets age as a qualification for presidential candidates. Regardless of the President's actual power, it is disrespectful and negligent to prescribe such relaxed requirements for the head of state. Article 81 states that if the President or Vice-President of the Judicial Yuan or Examination Yuan resigns due to an incident during the recess of the National Assembly, the President may appoint an acting President with the consent of the National Committee. However, there are no regulations on how to replace or whether to replace legislators or censors who resign. The National Assembly is in recess for a long time, so this should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>(3) The Executive Yuan According to Article 87, the powers of the Executive Yuan are shared by the various ministries. According to Article 90, important matters are decided by meetings. Therefore, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has no real power. However, according to Article 86, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must resign if he loses a vote of confidence in the Legislative Yuan or is impeached by the Control Yuan. It is legally untenable to subject a figurehead with no real power to the double burden of responsibility. Moreover, according to Article 86 alone, if the National Committee rejects a vote of no confidence from the Legislative Yuan or an impeachment from the Control Yuan, how should the conflict between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan/Control Yuan be resolved? What responsibilities should the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan bear in this case? There is no provision for any of this. The Executive Yuan is severely restricted and has no real power, while the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan are unrestrained. If they abuse their power, how will it be prevented, and how will the Executive Yuan promote administrative affairs, observe national conditions, and observe the changes in the world? It is hoped that this political system will be amended.</p>
<p>(4) The Legislative Yuan The Legislative Yuan in this draft constitution is merely a consultative body. As stipulated in the previous chapter, there are already two major political power organs, the National Assembly and the National Committee, so the number of legislators does not need to be as high as two hundred. Article 95 states that the Legislative Yuan has the power to decide on other important international matters. The term "important" is easily subject to subjective interpretation and can easily cause disputes. Such wording should not be included in the constitution. Article 96, Paragraph 2, intertwines inquiries and no-confidence motions, making it easily exploited by ambitious individuals and causing political turmoil. Moreover, according to the previous section, the no-confidence motion should be submitted to the National Committee, but this is not clearly stated here. Furthermore, if the no-confidence motion fails to pass, it is not stipulated whether the Legislative Yuan should be dissolved and re-elected. Even from the perspective of traditional constitutional principles, this is also inappropriate.</p>
<p>(5) The Judicial Yuan There is ongoing debate as to whether the Department of Judicial Administration should belong to the Judicial Yuan or the Executive Yuan, with no consensus reached. This draft constitution boldly places it under the Judicial Yuan, presumably to protect judicial independence. Judicial independence is a matter of course, and we cannot disagree. However, judicial independence should also have its correct definition, referring only to the independence of the judiciary. As for judicial policy, it is closely related to the overall policy of the country and should not be allowed to follow its own course. This is why the judicial departments of various countries are subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Therefore, the appropriateness of the constitutional provisions is still to be discussed.</p>
<p>(6) The Examination Yuan The draft constitution does not mention the Examination Committee, presumably because such an agency does not need to be permanent, which shows a spirit of economy and seems to be an improvement over the current system. However, examinations are a major policy of the country, and the status of the members of the Examination Committee should be very respected. How they should be appointed and how they should be set up should also be specified in the constitution.</p>
<p>(7) The Control Yuan The powers of the Control Yuan, their scope of exercise, and their methods of exercise are not specified in detail, which may increase the difficulty of exercising them in the future. This should be elaborated on. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e113">Chairman's Report <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>After the customary formalities, the Chairman gave a report, briefly stating: Today is the memorial day for the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. This uprising was the last of the ten failed revolutions of our party. At that time, the Premier was in Penang preparing for the uprising, and the date of the launch was originally set for March 15th. However, due to the non-arrival of military supplies, it had to be postponed. But the news was leaked and could not be delayed for long. Therefore, Comrade Huang Keqiang went to Guangzhou on March 29th to make arrangements, with attacks from four directions. Huang Keqiang himself attacked the Governor's Office, Yao Yuping attacked Xiaobeimen, Chen Jiongming attacked the Police Training Institute, and Hu Yisheng guarded Dananmen. At that time, Huang had already entered the Governor's Office, but the other three routes could not proceed simultaneously. Huang was defeated due to being isolated. The number of dead was probably more than seventy-two. Later, because only seventy-two bodies were found, only this number is known. Because of this uprising, there was the recovery of Wuhan that year. We believe that this commemoration is of the greatest significance, because the martyrs sacrificed for the nation. Their goal at the time was not only in Guangzhou, nor was it just to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. Because since the Qing Dynasty entered China, internal affairs have become increasingly corrupt, and the people have been increasingly oppressed. The Premier, in view of this situation, rose up in revolution. The Premier's revolutionary goal was the whole world, with China as the starting point. Therefore, today, in commemorating the martyrs, we should emulate their spirit of struggle and complete the Premier's will. The New Life Movement recently promoted by Chairman Chiang aims at self-cultivation and the vigorous implementation of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. Because in recent years, social phenomena have destroyed our country's original morality. If this continues, the future of the country and the nation is unimaginable. Any country or nation that loses propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame will never be able to survive. Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of a country. If the four pillars are not upheld, the country will perish. The Premier advocated loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, and the purpose was also here. The promotion of the New Life Movement in this city has established a preparatory office, and a promotion association will be officially established soon. It is planned to start with cleanliness and order, so that everyone has vigor, and then concentrate on revitalizing the nation.) The rest is omitted.</p>

<p>Briefly stating that today, in commemorating the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, we can recall the heroic spirit and brave sacrifice of the martyrs at that time. If there had been no such revolution by the martyrs in the past, not only would there be no Republic of China, but China would have already perished. Although the people currently feel pain, it is inevitable in a transitional era. The only way to alleviate the pain is to implement the Three Principles of the People. Now, the New Life Movement is being promoted, and the Chairman has explained it very clearly just now. This brother serves in the army. Chairman Chiang said that the people should be militarized, clean, tidy, simple, and plain. This is what the army does every day, and it is the most important thing. If people from all walks of life can do this, there will be excellent results, etc. After the speech, slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>The Financial Community's Attitude Toward Adopting</p>
<h3 id="e116">Gold Standard System <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Believes it is Not a Thorough Solution</p>
<p>Dangers May Arise Once Implemented</p>
<p>Peng Xuepei's Original Proposal</p>
<p>The National Economic Council recently held a plenary meeting in Nanjing. It has been decided to hand over the proposal by Peng Xuepei, Vice Minister of the Interior, to adopt a transitional measure of the gold standard, to the Currency System Committee of the Ministry of Finance for research. After the research results are obtained, the Ministry of Finance will carefully consider its implementation. A reporter from the New News Agency learned that the financial community in this city believes that adopting the gold exchange standard has more disadvantages than advantages and is not a thorough solution. It should be known that China itself has neither sufficient reserves in peacetime nor the surplus to purchase overseas gold. If the gold standard is implemented, the dangers will be self-evident. However, Mr. Peng believes that the adoption of the gold standard is urgently needed for China's international trade and lending relationships. The original text of Mr. Peng's proposal is recorded below. China's international position in currency is becoming increasingly isolated. Its foreign trade and lending relationships are exposed to great risks. China suffers great losses every time the price of silver changes, as it did when the price of silver fell in 1929, and will do so again if the price of silver rises this time. The adoption of the gold standard has become an urgent need. However, there are two major difficulties in adopting the gold standard: one is that China would suddenly have a large amount of savings, and the other is that the Chinese people are accustomed to using silver and it is not easy to change this habit suddenly. In order to make the transition from the silver standard to the gold standard easier and more hopeful, it is proposed that</p>
<h3 id="e117">Transitional Measures <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>be as follows: (1) The government should allow the Central Bank to issue gold banknotes based on the same reserve ratio as silver banknotes. The guarantee reserve should not exceed 40%, and the cash reserve should not be less than 60%. The guarantee reserve can be used for public bonds or commercial bills, and the cash reserve can be used for cash, or for gold units as a 100% cash reserve, or deposits in gold standard countries. (2) Gold and silver banknotes will circulate on the market at the same time, without specifying a fixed ratio, and will be exchanged at market prices, like silver coins and copper coins on the market today. (3) The gold coin unit is equal to one-quarter of the gold unit currently used by customs. (4) The Central Bank should increase gold reserves as much as possible, issue gold banknotes, and strive to promote them. (5) Banks can</p>
<h3 id="e118">Central Bank <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>use gold banknotes in the same way as silver banknotes. (6) Private individuals who bring various gold ingots and goldware to the Central Bank or its designated agent to exchange for gold banknotes will be exempt from all handling fees. (7) Gold banknotes have unlimited legal tender status. (8) At a certain time, all government agencies' receipts and expenditures will be calculated in gold coins, but the use of gold banknotes and silver coins will still be allowed. (9) The Central Bank will take the opportunity to exchange silver for gold and gradually increase gold reserves whenever the price of silver rises. (10) The exchange of gold banknotes must be for 5,000 yuan or more. The Central Bank may pay with immediate or 60-day gold exchange rates. (11) Banks can accept gold ingots and goldware, convert them into gold coins, and use them as</p>
<h3 id="e119">Gold Coin Deposits <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>"The benefits of this transitional measure" (1) Gold in China is mainly used for ornaments and savings, not as currency. In recent years, gold exports have often exceeded imports. Adopting a transitional measure will add an important use for gold in China, that is, as a medium for domestic transactions. Although this cannot completely prevent the tendency of trade surpluses, it will undoubtedly make a considerable rescue. (2) Issuing gold banknotes will increase a new source of income for the country to improve the currency, without hindering the credit of banknotes in the slightest. (3) Increasing the number of chips on the market can achieve considerable</p>
<h3 id="e120">Increase in Prices <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>effect. (4) Most of the gold that the general public hoards or uses for decoration will be used in the financial sector. (5) Banks' gold reserves will gradually increase, and the country's gold reserves will also gradually increase. (6) The public will gradually get used to using gold coins. (7) Gradually exchange silver for gold. When transitioning to the gold standard, only a portion of the currency needs to be converted, which will not cause too drastic changes. (8) When the general public buys and sells small amounts of gold, they often suffer greatly from exploitation in and out. After adopting gold banknotes, this drawback can be avoided and the public's willingness to use gold can be increased. (9) The Central Bank's deposits abroad can be used as a reserve for gold banknotes. (10) Those who are related to</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Trade <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>or have foresight will inevitably compete to use gold coins. Also, those who enter into various long-term contracts and fear that changes in the price of silver will affect their income will be happy to use the gold standard as a unit. (11) Chinese farmers use copper coins, which is enough to prove that there is no need to replace the more valuable metal with currency in China's domestic economy. However, this does not prevent the adoption of the gold standard, because smaller units can be used. For example, although France uses the gold standard, its unit, the franc, is only worth two dimes in our country. Today, the gold coin unit is about half a silver dollar, which is even more convenient for public use.</p>

<p>Expanding the Mint to Coin Decimal Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange Standard Plan is Under Study</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. He met with reporters at his residence yesterday morning. According to him, many people have advocated the adoption of the gold exchange standard in the past. After Mr. Peng Xuepei proposed it at the Economic Committee this time, it has been decided to hand it over to the Currency System Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance for research. Whether our country should adopt the gold exchange standard at present is too big a question and is currently under study. After the research results are obtained, the Ministry of Finance will carefully consider and decide whether to proceed. However, the report quoted my conversation last night as saying that although many countries in the world have adopted the gold standard, some have abandoned the gold standard and adopted the silver standard, which "is actually a mistake of abandoning the gold standard and adopting the gold and silver standard." As for reforming the currency system, the Economic Committee has passed a resolution to invest 16 million to proceed. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done in a short time. Because the silver coins used in various places in the interior are quite complicated, and the market prices of other subsidiary coins sometimes rise and fall, causing the general public to suffer great losses due to the exchange rate when money comes in and goes out. Therefore, in order to eliminate long-standing abuses and unify the currency system, the Ministry of Finance plans to expand the mint, coin new silver coins and decimal subsidiary coins, circulate them on the market, and at the same time, recall and destroy the old miscellaneous coins, so that the currency system will gradually be unified and will be actively implemented to achieve it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Please Unify the Import Tax on Foreign Rice in Fujian and Guangdong <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Order the Two Provinces to Add Tax on the Same Day in Accordance with the Current Foreign Rice Import Tax Rate</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Grain, Oilcake, and Bean and Rice Trade Association, telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang regarding the unification of foreign rice taxation in Fujian and Guangdong, requesting that taxes be added on the same day. The telegram reads (titles omitted): Since the government levied import tax on foreign rice last year, only the three provinces of South China have been excluded, so the relief of rural areas has not seen practical results. Therefore, the association has successively telegraphed the Jun Yuan (Ministry) and Chairman Chiang, requesting permission to order the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian to unify the tax rate. Later, Chairman Chiang replied that Fujian Province will implement it soon, and Guangdong Province is also in negotiations. The people heard this and celebrated with their hands. However, it was recently reported that from March 15th of this year, the import tax on foreign rice in Fujian Province will be collected at half the current tax rate. That is, after the tax increase, the ratio to customs duties is only one-half. Compared with before the tax increase, it is only fifty steps to one hundred steps. How much can be effective? Now that existing grain is abundant and prices are trending lower, if sales channels are not cleared and finances are not activated, the spring harvest will come soon and will be greatly hit. I am afraid that merchants will stop at the market because of the greater loss, and farmers will stop farming because of the greater difficulty. How terrible is the trouble? Moreover, the great powers are holding their dumping policies and seeking the world market. Our country's backward industry is enough to be its tail. The leakage in the past is amazing. The backwardness of industry and commerce has made people's livelihood difficult, and the excess import of agricultural products has shaken the foundation of the country. How can it be delayed to mend the fold after the sheep is lost? The association considers the overall situation and considers the people. It believes that the leakage in South China must be blocked in order to cultivate the foundation of the country and relieve the people's difficulties. Therefore, I would like to reiterate the circumstances and telegraph Jun Yuan Department to quickly order the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong not to look forward and delay any longer. On the same day, in accordance with the current foreign rice import tax rate, add taxes in unison to solve the problem. I am anxiously waiting for orders. Shanghai Grain, Oilcake, and Bean and Rice Trade Association Chairman Gu Xingyi bowed. The Yan, originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai immediately, was delayed for a few days due to the bad weather in Beiping. Then, at 9:15 AM yesterday, she flew from Beiping to Shanghai. The French Consulate General in this port received a telegram from Shanghai and immediately notified the municipal government to assign police and security teams to Hongqiao Airport for protection. Those who came to the airport to welcome her included French Consul General Meili Ai and dozens of French nationals. Miss Hirth drove the plane and landed safely at Hongqiao Airport at 2:25 PM yesterday afternoon. After getting off the plane, the welcoming staff shook hands with her. Miss Hirth then took a car with Consul General Mei to the French Consulate for rest. According to Consul General Mei, Miss Hirth will stay in Shanghai for about four or five days, and then fly to Hong Kong and return to her country along the original road. It is said that the French bridge in Shanghai will hold a grand banquet to welcome her, and Mayor Wu will also host a banquet.</p>

<p>Chuanhe Qilun Company</p>
<h3 id="e130">League Pact Decided to Dissolve <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Implementation Starts on April 1st</p>
<p>The Chuanhe Qilun Company League raised the water fee, causing Shanghai's Chuanbang merchants to stop handling goods and refuse transportation. This dispute has lasted for more than 50 days. Although various parties have mediated, it is difficult to reach a complete solution. The shipping companies have been meeting for days and after discussing the results, it was decided to dissolve the pact from April 1st, and to convene another meeting today to discuss the aftermath of the abolition of the alliance, and to redraft the new water fee. This matter is very important to the cargo transportation of the Chuanbang. In order to understand the truth behind this matter, the reporter personally went to each shipping company to investigate. The reasons are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Minsheng Becomes the Target of Public Criticism <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Chuanhe shipping company initiated the alliance and increased the water fee, raising the price of cheap domestic products by more than double, and there are even unreasonable measures such as not distinguishing between grades and measuring ruler goods and weighing goods by the catty, which caused great opposition from the Sichuan merchants. Shanghai stopped shipping goods, and the various merchant groups in Chongqing had major negotiations with the Minsheng Company, causing the Minsheng Company to become the target of public criticism. The failure of the clever plan was probably unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shipping Companies Negotiate to Remedy <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new alliance fee on February 20, the shipping companies on the Chuanhe line have been affected by the suspension of cargo handling. Holding on like this for a long time has caused huge losses to the shipping companies. According to the round-trip of Shanghai-Chongqing direct shipping ships, it takes a full month, and the cost of large ships is about 20,000 yuan, and even shallow water ships cost about 10,000 yuan. If the alliance fee problem is not resolved for one day, it is difficult for the Sichuan ships to suffer invisible losses. On the 28th, representatives from Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Jiejang, Sanbei, Yihua, and other shipping companies held a meeting at Jardine Matheson to discuss ways to open a new situation. It was generally believed that April is the high water period of the upper Yangtze River, and the water fee should also be reduced as usual. Each company is now bound by the alliance, which is not worth it. So they telegraphed the Minsheng General Company in Chongqing to ask whether the alliance agreement will continue or be dissolved after the expiration of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Alliance Pact Decided to Dissolve <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the telegram was sent, the Minsheng General Company in Chongqing replied, and the wording was very smooth. The general idea was that the Minsheng Company is willing to cooperate sincerely with the other companies and continue the alliance on the extension of the Chuanhe shipping cooperation alliance after the expiration of the trial period. However, the Chongqing industries and gangs have severely criticized the Minsheng Company, making it difficult to extend. The general idea is like this. After receiving the Minsheng reply, the shipping companies decided to completely abolish the Chuanlun Alliance Cooperation Agreement signed on February 11 from April 1, and each of the seven companies will operate independently in order to eliminate difficulties and obstacles and develop a new situation. The unreasonable freight rates set during the alliance period will also be completely abolished, and each shipping company will negotiate a new freight rate suitable for each industry and gang to comply with.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Another Reasonable New Freight Rate Will Be Set <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>It was reported yesterday that the Chongqing merchant gangs have agreed on a new freight rate method and will implement it on April 1. The reporter asked the person in charge of each shipping company, and they said that this is only a one-sided water fee price drafted by the Chongqing merchant gangs, which is difficult for the shipping companies to agree to. According to the quantity and ruler freight price, each ton is only 11 yuan, and the freight price to Hankou is more than this amount. This and the 100 yuan per ton set by the alliance are both unreasonable mistakes. This news may have some effect, but let's not discuss it for now. However, after the dissolution of the alliance, the shipping companies have agreed to divide the Chuanhe freight into three periods: high water, normal water, and shallow water. The main cotton yarn water fee will be reduced to 16 yuan during shallow water, 14 yuan during normal water, and 12 yuan during high water. For those who calculate by ruler, it is planned to charge 2 yuan per ruler during normal water, 20% discount during high water, and 25% increase during shallow water. This is the fairest. Other goods will be divided into grades and levels, and no slight bias will be allowed.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Another Meeting Will Be Convened Today <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Chuanhe shipping company's dissolution of the alliance is only two days away from today and must be implemented. Since the new water fee price is determined to be reasonable, each shipping company has agreed to convene the seven shipping companies at Sanbei today to hold a large meeting to discuss the aftermath of the dissolution of the alliance, and the new water fee for each cargo will be re-negotiated and revised at today's meeting. Once it is determined, it will be notified to the Sichuan merchants, so that the dispute between the merchants and shipping industries on the Chuanhe River for more than 50 days, and the suspension of cargo handling by the Sichuan foreign miscellaneous goods gangs, can be resolved under today's meeting. A storm can come to an end from now on.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Appeal from the Egg Industry <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the Authorities</p>
<p>Requesting Reduction of Tariffs and Freight Rates</p>
<p>The Egg Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting a reduction in tax rates and freight costs, which stated: "To whom it may concern, since the successive increases in taxes both domestically and internationally, as well as the increased levels of railway freight rates, our industry has been burdened to the point of unsustainability. As a result, nearly eight or nine out of ten businesses have been forced to close. A small number of manufacturers in Fujian, unwilling to see the egg industry completely disappear, are attempting to persevere and salvage what they can. However, with the continuous sharp decline in market prices over the years, losses have been enormous, leading to utter failure and an irreparable situation. Therefore, on the 26th of this month, we convened an emergency meeting to discuss remedial measures. The consensus was that without a reduction in export taxes and railway freight rates, the egg industry has no possibility of continuing to survive. We are now detailing the reasons for the requested reductions separately as follows: According to the current customs tax rates, egg yolk powder is subject to a regular tax of 12 yuan per 100 kilograms, plus a 10% disaster relief surcharge and a 3% dock tax, totaling 13.56 yuan. The selling price is only 41 yuan. After deducting taxes, the actual revenue is 27.44 yuan. The ratio of selling price to customs tax is 50%. For wet egg yolk, the regular tax is 3.9 yuan per 100 kilograms, plus a 10% disaster relief surcharge and a 3% dock tax, totaling 4.407 yuan. The selling price is only 16.535 yuan. After deducting taxes, the actual revenue is 12.128 yuan. The ratio of selling price to customs tax is just over 36%. This error is due to the fact that the valuation when the tax regulations were revised at the time is vastly different from the current market price. Without a revaluation, manufacturers will find it extremely difficult to bear the burden. This is the reason why the export tax should be reduced. Regarding railway freight rates, egg products have always been classified as fourth-class. Since August 1, 1932, fees have been charged according to the newly revised freight classification table, with egg yolk powder and egg white reclassified as second-class, and wet egg yolk reclassified as third-class. Our association has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Railways to restore the old classification in order to alleviate the burden on manufacturers and maintain the precarious situation of the industry. We were granted approval for a one-year trial period, and the request was temporarily deferred. Now, the one-year trial period has long passed, and freight rates have not been reduced. In reality, whether the railway bureau's income has increased remains unknown. Continuing in this manner will only result in a lose-lose situation for both the railway and the businesses. What manufacturers find particularly painful is that second-class goods cannot be packed together with third and fourth-class goods. There are few second-class goods, so we must wait until they are fully loaded before shipping, which delays the deadline and causes the goods to spoil. The resulting losses are even greater. If we change to less-than-carload shipping, the freight costs become even higher. How can the struggling egg industry bear such heavy blows? This is the reason why railway freight rates should be reduced. Regarding the above two requests, we earnestly hope that your esteemed association will immediately send a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and also send telegrams separately to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways. Regardless of whether our requests can be granted, we request a prompt reply to determine our course of action. Even if the government cannot understand the difficulties of manufacturers and prevent closures, it should consider the hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers across the country. This matter concerns the survival of the entire industry. We earnestly hope for your strong assistance and separate handling of these issues."</p>

<h3 id="e138">Sudden Change in Weng Wenhao's Condition <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Suffering from Meningitis, Onset is Quite Severe</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang Has Gone to Hangzhou to Visit</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Weng Wenhao, Director of the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica, was injured in a car accident near Wukang on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway on the 16th of last month. He was immediately transferred to Hangzhou Guangji Hospital and invited renowned Chinese and Western doctors, including Niu Huilin, Engel, and Dr. Goodchild, the director of Guangji Hospital, for detailed diagnosis and treatment. At that time, his condition was considered to be relatively good. However, the bone fragments embedded in his brain should have been surgically removed immediately, but there were concerns about potential complications. Therefore, it was planned to perform the surgery after a period of convalescence. In addition to Dr. Goodchild of Guangji Hospital providing nearby treatment, Drs. Niu and Engel returned to Shanghai. According to a telegram received by a close friend of Mr. Weng's in this city a few days ago from Hangzhou, Mr. Weng has developed meningitis due to the abnormal weather recently, and the onset has been very severe, with talk of preparing for his final affairs. Mr. Ding Wenjiang and other friends of Mr. Weng's have now gone to Hangzhou to investigate and consult with doctors in Hangzhou for thorough treatment. However, it is reported that he is still in critical condition.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Farmers May Use Grain as Collateral for Loans <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, stating in essence: "Low grain prices harm farmers, a problem that has been lamented throughout history. This year's grain prices are particularly low, an unprecedented situation. If measures are not taken to provide relief, rural bankruptcy will occur, affecting the people's livelihood and having significant consequences. Various cooperatives should engage in the storage of essential food grains so that farmers can use grain as collateral for loans. Rural finance should rely on regulation. We are issuing regulations and ordering the county magistrate to comply accordingly." County Magistrate Pan ordered all county cooperatives yesterday to comply and report on their implementation for inspection.</p>
<p>Huasha Cotton Mill Seeds Picking</p>
<h3 id="e141">Cotton Merchants Request Temporary Suspension <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Suggest Waiting for New Cotton to Market</p>
<p>Both Parties to Rectify in Production Areas</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association stated that recently, various mills have purchased cotton that contains a large amount of seed cotton or cotton seeds. Therefore, it has notified all mills to pick out cotton seeds and deduct them proportionally to avoid losses. It is now known that the local Cotton Ginning Industry Association and other trade associations have stated that this measure has caused great suffering to those engaged in the cotton business. They specially requested the mills to wait until the new cotton comes to market and for the mills and cotton merchants to jointly sort the cotton when purchasing goods in the production areas. Details are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Mill Announcement <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association previously issued an announcement stating: "According to reports from various mills, the cotton purchased recently contains a large amount of seed cotton or cotton seeds, resulting in significant invisible losses. The meeting has decided that in the future, if any cotton purchased by the mills is found to contain mixed seed cotton or cotton seeds, two bales out of every hundred bales will be taken out, and the cotton seeds or seed cotton that is picked out will be deducted proportionally according to the weight. This announcement is hereby issued to all members for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Cotton Merchants Expressed <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The local Cotton Ginning Industry, Cotton Firm, Cotton Yarn Firm, Cotton Trading Firm, Cotton Distribution Merchants Association, and other trade associations have expressed their opinions to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association regarding the announcement of seed picking. In essence, they stated: "On February 18th of this year, your association announced that all members should comply with the seed picking notice. Upon hearing the news, the industry was alarmed. The Cotton Ginning Industry, Cotton Yarn Firm, Cotton Transportation Industry, and Cotton Trading Firm associations jointly convened a meeting to discuss the matter. The consensus was that improving cotton production should be supported, but since cotton from various regions has already been transported to the market, sudden picking and deduction will inevitably cause unexpected losses to those in transit. It was decided to send a letter requesting the mills to wait until the new cotton comes to market and for the mills and cotton merchants to jointly sort the cotton when purchasing goods in the production areas in order to implement the measure and achieve full effectiveness. After sending the letter, people were sent to consult, but there was no clear response. The mills, citing newspaper reports, have been strictly picking and deducting cotton, with no standards and inconsistencies, causing undue suffering to those engaged in the cotton business, without any restrictions. Investigating the rectification of cotton production and strictly prohibiting adulteration, our association presented a proposal to the Ministry of Industry in October 1931, which was approved and ordered to be circulated in cotton-producing areas. However, adulteration occurs in the production areas, not in the market. It is feared that not cracking down in the production areas but implementing the measures in the market is not a well-considered plan. Our association's request for a temporary suspension and joint rectification is nothing more than a fundamental plan to rectify cotton production. It is only a slight delay, and during the rectification process, it can avoid infringing on the interests of those in transit and promote smooth implementation. Otherwise, those who adulterate will suffer no loss, while cotton merchants will be exceptionally exploited. What could be more unfair than this? We are now reiterating our previous request, hoping that your association will publish a statement in the newspaper to temporarily suspend implementation. It is believed that your association's members and our association's colleagues have the friendship of hosts and guests and are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and will be able to consider both aspects and be happy to support this."</p>

<p>Amending the Constitution and Reducing Membership Fees</p>
<p>The second council of the China International Trade Association held its first meeting at the Bank Club the other day. Those present were Pei Songsun, Xu Jiliu, Guo Bingwen, Pan Xulun, Zou Bingwen, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, etc. Zhang Gongquan was elected as chairman of the board, and Chen Guangfu, Guo Bingwen, Zou Bingwen, and Lin Kanghou were elected as executive directors. Pan Guangjiong was appointed as general secretary. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Shi Liangcai, the new director, resigned, and everyone unanimously asked him to stay. (2) The work plan was approved and submitted to the executive directors for research and implementation methods. (3) Tu Houbin suggested unified transportation and direct export, which was submitted to the executive directors for research. (4) The Overseas Chinese Trust Public Affairs Board of Directors suggested eight amendments to the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, which should be distributed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Industry, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for verification and handling. (5) Amend the constitution and reduce membership fees. The annual fee for basic members, organizations, was reduced from 100 yuan to 50 yuan, the annual fee for individuals was reduced from 30 yuan to 20 yuan, and the annual fee for ordinary members was reduced from 10 yuan to 5 yuan. It is also planned to broadly solicit various industry colleagues and professional scholars to join.</p>
<p>Light Tax Diesel</p>
<h3 id="e145">Investigation of Applicability to Engines <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stated that the Ministry of Finance's increase in the import tax rate on diesel has had a significant impact on various industries that use diesel as fuel for machinery. It has requested the Ministry of Finance to postpone the implementation of the new tax standards in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance replied that the diesel tax rate was originally divided into two types, A and B, and has not been increased uniformly. Among the light-tax diesel fuels, there are also those that can be applied to engines and other machinery. Therefore, the newly established diesel tax standards do not hinder various industries that use diesel as fuel for machinery. According to a reporter's investigation, the Special Solar Oil sold on the market is the light-tax diesel listed in the Ministry of Finance's new tax regulations. Experts from factories in various regions believe that it is suitable for diesel engine fuel. For example, the National diesel engine from Jardine Matheson, the Gardner diesel engine from William Jacks &amp; Co., the Ruston diesel engine from Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co., the Deutz diesel engine from Jebsen &amp; Co., and the Blackstone diesel engine from Dodwell &amp; Co. are all very suitable. Currently, the Hengyuanxiang Cotton Ginning Factory in Pudong, Shanghai, the Chengyu Cotton Ginning Factory, the Shengtailou Steamboat Company, the Shaoxing Daming Electric Light Company, the Nanjing Datong Flour Mill, the Pinghu Pinghu Electric Light Company, and others have all used this special solar oil to reduce fuel costs.</p>

<p>The basic work of setting up the control points for the land survey in Shanghai County has been completed. Currently, the Department of Land Administration of the Province is assigning a survey team to measure the traverse lines, and the household land survey will be conducted soon. However, the county government believes that the location names recorded in the land deeds for private land transactions in the county and the township and district map preservation numbers used by the collection office to calculate the area and tax amount are still used for convenience. It has now been decided that this survey will use the original maps as units, but the boundaries must be reorganized. According to the existing 74 maps, numbers will be assigned from No. 1 to No. 74. Lands that were previously surveyed with interspersed plots will be included in the calculation of the land in this map, and under the newly compiled map name in the current map book, the original map number will be noted for reference. Now, in order to understand the original township and district boundaries of each district for easy reference during the survey, the county government has specially prepared rough maps of each district and the names of the township and district maps, and has ordered the district chiefs to comply, immediately investigate and clarify the boundaries of all township and district maps within their jurisdiction, as well as the names of the villages where the boundaries are located, and mark and test the boundaries in the issued rough map of the district and submit them to the county for compiling a general map and forwarding it to the survey team for application.</p>

<p>=Two Russians, one posing as Vice-Consul, one posing as French Chief Inspector=</p>
<p>=Agreed at a Dinner at D. Doutremeline, Arrested Together=</p>
<p>Russian Lai Weiciji is a well-known international fraudster. He was once arrested by the Public Concession Police and handed over to the First Special District Court for sentencing and punishment. After being released, he still did not repent. Not long after, he relapsed and colluded with his accomplices Luo Mainuofu Baili and others to deceive Xu Haidu and Fan, who previously worked in the Public Concession's sample room. First, Lai, posing as French Vice-Consul Bai Leai, ordered his accomplice Luo Mainuofu to pose as the French police chief inspector to lead Xu to the French Consulate in December of last year, pretending to introduce him to Lai (i.e., the alias Bai Leai). Lai falsely claimed to be the French Vice-Consul and said that the chief inspector (referring to Luo Mainuofu) was a close friend who could help him obtain a club license (i.e., a gambling den), but a large amount of lobbying fees would be required to succeed. Xu and others believed it to be true and immediately ordered Fan to register in his name. On the afternoon of the 28th (the other day), at about 7 p.m., they hosted a banquet at the D. Doutremeline Restaurant on Sichuan Road to discuss the organization of a large-scale gambling den with the fake chief inspector and fake vice-consul. After Xu met with these people, he immediately ordered Zhou to rent a large Western-style empty house at No. 634 Lane, Xiafei Road, actively renovating it, waiting for the license to be issued before opening. However, the matter was detected by Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Support Police, who ordered Secretary Qian Renlong to disguise himself as a dinner guest and participate in their banquet. During the banquet, Lai demanded 30,000 yuan as lobbying fees for the consulate and the police. Just as they were discussing the matter, Secretary Qian used the telephone to report to Chief Inspector Jin and Deputy Chief Inspector Warren, Inspector Greilishi, Russian Detective Faraofu, and Chinese and Western detectives. Together with the Public Police, they arrested the entire group of perpetrators and brought them to the police station, waiting to be handed over to the Second Court for interrogation.</p>

During the Fujian Incident, all Chinese ships suspended service. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, the ships have resumed service one after another. The Fujian community in Shanghai continued to handle goods as usual. The income from passenger tickets and shipping charges for each voyage was very good. The Yili, represented by Lian'an Shipping Company, and the Yong'an, of Dazhen Company, have joined the Shanghai-Fujian route. The Yong'an is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the first time at the end of this month. As for the China Merchants Bureau's Taishun, it was repaired today and is scheduled to resume service on the Shanghai-Fujian route starting next month. The Jiahe, which was temporarily substituting, will be reassigned to the Shanghai-Ou route.</p>

<p>Xiangsheng Chauffeur Causes Trouble</p>
<p>Police Still Need to Investigate</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th, the Xiangsheng Automobile Company sent chauffeur Zhang Zhiyun, a local, to drive car No. 18462 on a business trip to Tongfu Road. At about 5 p.m., Zhang was driving south to north on Route Mayerciere in the French Concession, when Liu Bangfu, a 73-year-old man from Tongzhou who lived nearby, went out to buy tin foil and was walking on the side of the road. The driver, Zhang, was careless and the car rushed out of the street edge, knocking Liu down and injuring his head. Patrolman No. 556 found the accident and sent Liu to Guangci Hospital while taking Zhang and the car to the police station for investigation. Liu, due to his old age and severe injuries, died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, and the Vehicle Affairs Office sent a detective to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. The next day, the Second Special District Court was asked to send someone to investigate and clarify the matter. The body was collected by Liu Yukun, a member of the family. In the afternoon, the Vehicle Affairs Office sent the defendant Zhang Zhiyun to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case, stating that the Vehicle Affairs Office's investigation was not yet complete and requested a postponement until the case was clarified before proceeding with the trial. The defendant was defended by lawyer Shen Xiaoxiang. The court briefly questioned the defendant about the circumstances of the accident and then ordered that the hearing be postponed until the investigation was completed. The defendant was temporarily detained at the police station.</p>

Unexpectedly, the woman disregarded the girl's young age and forced her to engage in sexual relations with adult men, forcing her into prostitution. Under the threat of lust, the girl could not resist and had to endure the pain and reluctantly obey. By December, she had received a total of three clients, all at the virgin price of 30 yuan each.

After the opening, the results were remarkable, and the daily business was the best in the history of the exhibitions. Recently, it was heard that the delegation sent a telegram from Wuhan, at the invitation of Chairman He of Hunan Province, planning to participate in the Changsha National Products Exhibition immediately, in order to awaken the people of the province to love and use national products. At the same time, they also received a telegram from Chairman He, forwarded by Director Hu, the representative of Hunan Province stationed in Wuhan, to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Wu Zhihao, Xu Jianruo, and Hu Xiyuan: "Director Hu Xiehuai, to Yu Qiaqing, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Wu Zhihao, Xu Jianruo, and Hu Xiyuan, gentlemen.

In addition to instructing the Department of Construction to forward the order to the National Products Exhibition Hall and the Changsha Chamber of Commerce to actively prepare, I hereby send a telegram to welcome you. I respectfully hope that you will send personnel to Hunan in advance to prepare." He Jian respectfully bowed and signed. Therefore, the standing committee members of the association, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jianruo, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Wu Zhihao, and Hu Xiyuan, etc., believed that Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province, located in the central part of Hengshan Mountain, a vital commercial center on the Yangtze River, with a reputation for honest and kind customs and culture, and having received Chairman He's telegram invitation and the welcome of local chambers of commerce and other public organizations, it is imperative to speed up preparations and go to participate.

<p>The Yuping Railway starts from Yushan on the Zhejiang-Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway and ends at Pingxiang on the border of Jiangxi. The total cost of the entire line is about 60 million yuan. The first phase of the project costs about 12 million yuan, which will be used for surveying the route and purchasing materials. It has been decided to contact the Ministry of Railways, the Bank of Communications of China, and the Four Banks Savings Association to issue public bonds. Negotiations have been completed, and issuance can be started soon, but it will not circulate in the market.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company is building the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Yuping Railway. It has been reported that the banking industry in this city has invested 12 million yuan to help it succeed, and the road will be built in sections starting on the first day of next month. However, according to a person in charge of the banking industry yesterday, the loan of 12 million yuan has not yet been signed with the Ministry of Railways. Even if the contract is signed, the Ministry of Railways must issue public bonds. The construction will start on the first day of next month, or it will be postponed. Because after the commencement of the Yuping Railway, various materials are needed, which must be supplied by a materials company in Shanghai after the public bonds are issued before construction can begin.</p>

<p>The Shanghai French Concession Taxpayer's Association sent a letter to Zhong Siyun, the general manager of the Public Concession Works Bureau, stating, "According to taxpayer Qian Longzhang, a doctor, in a letter dated March 29, 'The taxpayer's telephone number is 32345. Today, someone from the Shanghai Telephone Company was sent to cut it off, causing it to be unusable. I immediately borrowed telephone number 31336 to inquire about 01, and the answer was that it was indeed cut off. This was confirmed at 11:50 AM. I checked that the taxpayer's telephone bill from March 1 to April 30 was paid on February 22 and a receipt was obtained. The taxpayer is a doctor, and this disconnection has caused significant losses in business and danger to patients. I request that your association send a letter to the Public Works Bureau, which manages and supervises franchised businesses, to immediately order the company to restore the line and compensate for material losses of 50 yuan per hour, as well as losses that cannot be calculated numerically,' etc. This kind of action by the Shanghai Telephone Company is extremely illegal. Even if there is an overdue payment situation, a final notice should be given in advance. However, the user's fee has already been paid, and the company disconnected the line without reason. If compensation is not ordered, how can the strictness of your bureau's management and supervision be demonstrated? I hereby request that your bureau handle this matter quickly."</p>

<p>Zhang Jinshan Entices Lu Aqing</p>
<p>Lu Aqing, a child from Jiangyin, ten years old, came to Shanghai to learn to be a coppersmith. He was reprimanded by his master and went out. He met abductor Zhang Jinshan (31 years old, from Ningbo), who enticed him to visit the City God Temple in the city. Because Lu wanted to go home, the abductor wanted to trick him to the pier. Lu was afraid that his master would chase him, and he looked flustered. Li Mingjun of the 22nd post saw him and found him suspicious, so he questioned him. Lu was dazed. Then someone nearby asked the child in the Jiangyin dialect, and he said that he did not know the man and that he had taken him to visit the City God Temple, etc. It was clearly an abduction. He was immediately taken to the police station for investigation. After questioning Lu, Director Liu learned that the defendant's name was Zhang Jinshan. When asked about his occupation and address, he was vague. When asked about his relationship with Lu, he gave evasive answers.

<p>Yesterday, the Xinwei Relief Association of this city sent a letter to the Chinese Buddhist Association regarding the relief for the monks in distress at Xuefeng Temple in Fujian, stating, "I have received your letter and the recorded minutes of the joint meeting on the 17th of this month, which resolved the methods for relieving the Fujian disaster. I am pleased to know the details. Regarding the section on our association allocating 500 yuan for relief, our standing member, Dharma Master Yuanying, has raised 500 yuan. However, our association has repeatedly received reports from the Buddhist Association of Fujian Province, the Merit Forest, etc., stating that Xuefeng Temple has suffered heavy losses due to the passage of troops through the area, and the monks are starving and freezing, which is extremely miserable. We have also forwarded the situation to your association for verification. The 500 yuan that our association has raised this time is intended to be allocated entirely to Xuefeng Temple to relieve the majority of the distressed monks and maintain the ancient temple. If this is approved, then this amount will be entrusted to Dharma Master Yuanying to remit to Xuefeng Temple to save procedures, etc. After reading it, we are extremely impressed. However, as the matter concerns cases that have already been resolved by various groups, it is not appropriate to make any changes. We hope that your association will still hand over the donated funds to this association for remittance to Mr. Sa Dingming for the purpose of supporting Xuefeng Temple, so as to comply with the resolution. We hereby give this notice in reply. I hope you will check and take note." International Society</p>

The affiliated association will closely study the strategies for dealing with Far Eastern issues and all international intelligence. This telegram is hereby sent."

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Guizhou Provincial Government</p>
<h3 id="e161">Exemption from Import Tax on Chinese-Made Electric Fans <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Guangxi Provincial Government, stating, "On the 27th of this month, we received a letter from the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, stating that the member association, Huasheng Electric Factory, has stated in a letter that the various electric fans manufactured by our factory are imported into Guangxi every year in considerable quantities. When these fans are exported, tax silver is paid to the Shanghai Customs. Recently, it has been heard that the Guangxi Provincial Government levies a tax on these fans when they enter the province. If this is true, we are deeply concerned that the cost will increase, making it impossible to compete with foreign goods. Our factory is the first factory in China to manufacture electrical appliances, and it has been fighting against foreign goods for many years, which is well known to society. If the tax in Guizhou Province is increased, it will be difficult to sell, which will have a great impact on the national products industry. Therefore, we hereby request that your association forward our request to Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government, asking him to consider the budding national products and order his subordinates to exempt our factory's electric fans from the tax on entering the province, in order to show maintenance and benefit the sales of national products, which is a public consensus. In the past, when the Likin tax in our country was not abolished, all foreign-style goods imitated by Chinese merchants using machinery, in addition to paying export tax at the port of shipment, were not taxed again, no matter which province they were transported to for sale, so as to encourage domestic products and compete with foreign goods. Now that the Likin tax has been abolished, there is no possibility of re-taxation, and the method of paying only one tax on foreign goods imitated by machinery has been in effect until now and has not changed. Your province has always been known for encouraging the development of industries and benefiting businesses. The Huasheng Electric Machinery Factory's electric fans, which are made by Chinese people, should be protected according to law when they are transported and sold in your province. It is appropriate to allow them to be exempted from import tax, which is a public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Establish an Evaluation Committee to Prevent Malpractice</p>
<p>The Nanshi National Products Market, sponsored by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city, has been attracting a continuous stream of customers due to the excellent quality and low prices of the products of the participating manufacturers, so much so that it is overwhelmed. The office of the market is currently in the period of the opening grand discount, fearing that the various departments in the market, due to the prosperity of business, may indulge in old bad habits or secretly raise prices, and has specially formed an evaluation committee to supervise. All committee members are hired by the market, and various regulations have been strictly stipulated.</p>
<p>The Sinking of the Sanjiang Steamer</p>
<h3 id="e163">It Can Be Towed Back to Shanghai Soon When the Water Rises <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Ningjing Steamer of the Ningjing-Ningshao Company ran aground on the Huifeng Reef upstream of Anqing in November last year while sailing from Hankou to Shanghai. The hull was damaged, and the bottom was stranded high on the reef. The river water was shallow and there was no way to escape. Therefore, the damaged parts were repaired first, and the crew and stewards were temporarily dismissed, waiting for the spring high water period this year to find a way to tow it back to Shanghai. It has been more than five months since then. The losses suffered by the steamer this time, including the company's loss of schedule business, is about 60,000 yuan. The dismissal of crew members and various expenses during the grounding period is about 30,000 yuan. The losses in hull insurance and repair costs also require 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, totaling 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. Now that the Yangtze River is rising, it is expected to be towed back to Shanghai for repairs within two weeks.</p>
<p>Emei: The Emei Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau ran aground on the Huatanzi Reef in the Sichuan River in June last year. The hull was stranded on a reef more than 20 feet high. The bureau sent the chief captain to tow it. After several months, the cost reached more than 100,000 yuan. Finally, the reef at the bottom of the ship was blasted away with explosives, and the hull was able to rest on the bank of the river. Now we have received a telegram from the captain, Ji Qingrong, stating that the Sichuan River is about to rise, and the Emei Steamer can soon float out of the shoal on its own during the high water. At that time, it can be towed into the heart of the river and return to Shanghai immediately. Preparations for towing assistance are now underway.</p>
<p>Qingpu: The Qingpu Steamer of the Sanbei Company ran aground on the levee at the Digang Wharf. The chief captain personally went to find a way to move the hull flat, causing it to be stranded for several months, but the hull was not broken. The company's direct and indirect losses amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. Now that the river water is rising day by day, the steamer also has hope of emerging from the shoal and can return to Shanghai for repairs in three weeks at the latest. In addition, the Taikoo Anqing Steamer, which ran aground in the fields on the bank of the Yangtze River at Qingshanzui, has now been sold by the company. First, the machinery was removed, and then the hull was dismantled, and Taikoo has given up operating the steamer on the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>Shishan Lane's Water Bill Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e168">Tenants Convened an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Shishan Lane, Huade Road, in this city have repeatedly received notices from the British-owned Shanghai Water Company, urging each household to pay a deposit of nine yuan for the installation of water meters, otherwise the water will be cut off. However, all the tenants in the lane believe that the water meter and water bill have always been borne by the owner, so it is not convenient to take direct action. Moreover, the installation of sub-water meters has not been agreed to by all the tenants. The company has installed them without authorization, so they have ignored them. Yesterday, the water company again notified the tenants of the lane to quickly sign the meter installation contract with the company and pay the deposit, otherwise the water will be cut off by the end of this month. The tenants of the lane immediately appointed Zhou Fuzhang as a representative to complain to the owner about the suffering of not being able to bear the burden, and in order to be done once and for all, contributed the idea of digging an artesian well in the lane to avoid the danger of water cuts. The property manager received them and agreed to forward them to the owner for consideration and then reply. However, the owner did not understand the suffering of the tenants and extended the lease to Fenling Lawyers to send a letter to the representative Zhou Zhuanzhang, warning him and making excuses for rent arrears, and preventing all the tenants from paying the deposit, and ordering them to leave the house within a month. This caused the anger of the tenants, who convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved that if the owner oppressed Zhou Jun, they were willing to swear to protect him to the end, regardless of any sacrifice.</p>

<p>Anhui Series</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Third Phase Will Be Published <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Series Compilation and Printing Office has published two phases of books, totaling 34 types, mostly taken from the most valuable works of the Anhui sages, reproduced in photo-offset from the original fine editions. In the first phase of books, such as Huang Yuesong's "Yu Gong Jin Shi" from Dangtu, Wang Long's "Mao Shi Yi Yi" from Shexian, Zhou Tingcai's "Han Shi Wai Zhuan Xiao Zhu" from Jixi, Wu Lang's "Wu Sheng Fan Qie Zheng Jun" from Quanjiao, Zhao Shaozu's "Tong Jian Zhu Shang" from Jingxian, Zhao Jixu's "Han Ru Zhuan Jing Ji" from Xiuning, Cheng Tong's "Xin'an Xue Xi," Abbot Jianjiang's Painting Gatha, and Jiang Yunning's Collection of Poems, are all books that scholars must read. The second phase of books is Cheng Yaotian's "Tong Yi Lu" from Shexian, with the addition of unpublished manuscripts and four kinds of lost works, which can be called perfect compared with the old edition. The original edition of "Tong Yi Lu" was priced at hundreds of tens of gold. Now, the increased printing price is only ten yuan, so as soon as the book came out, buyers rushed to buy it. It is indeed a great opportunity for scholars. It is said that the third phase of the series has been sent to press and will be published in about two months. It is said that the book list in this phase includes Yu Zhengxie's "Guiyi Lei Gao," which was personally revised in his later years, Jiang Yong's "Yun Xue San Shu," and Huang Sheng's "Zi Gu Yi Fu He An," among others. Yu's manuscript has been revised by nearly one-third of the original edition and has not been circulated. It is now borrowed from a book collector in Yixian by the office and sent to press in accordance with Yu's manuscript to preserve the true traces. Jiang's Yun Shu was finely proofread and carved in Jinling by Lu Lifu, the governor of Liangjiang during the Xianfeng period, who invited the phonology experts Xia Yu and Xia Xie from Dangtu. The entire plate was destroyed when the Taiping Army went east. Only ten copies were printed at that time, and they became rare treasures. "Zi Gu Yi Fu He An" is also a rare book on the market. The above-mentioned types are indeed special books for studying history, phonology, philology, and textual research, and are books that scholars must have. It is also said that the fourth and fifth phase book lists have also been finalized and will be issued for the world this year.</p>

<p>West Lake in Hangzhou is the most beautiful scenic spot in our country. It is surrounded by green mountains in the west, south, north, and the sparkling waves and misty shadows complement each other. In spring, warblers greet people, and in autumn, the bright moon clears the waves. In hot summer, the lotus breeze sends the evening coolness, and in the cold winter, the plum blossoms condense the snow. Ancient temples and villas, famous scenic spots and historical sites, are especially solemn and beautiful, making people happy and reluctant to leave, comparable to the famous Geneva in the world. Chen Xiaodie, a businessman and artist in this city, believes that such a famous scenic spot lacks a magnificent, well-equipped, quiet environment and attentive service, so he feels that it is a fly in the ointment. He has specially founded and organized a Die Lai Hotel next to Xiling Bridge to meet the needs of Chinese and foreign travelers. Its location is suitable and elegant, the equipment is perfect and clean, the waiters are attentive, and the architecture is exquisite and comfortable. It is a new highlight for the hotel industry and a record for the construction industry. He has now gathered comrades and is actively proceeding.</p>

<p>▲Shop Assistant Steals Money and Attempts Suicide Wu Zhengyuan, a 22-year-old man from Danyang, was a shop assistant at Taiyuan Clothing Store, No. 313 Qiwupu Road, Yangshupu. Recently, due to carelessness, he stole money and was discovered by the manager, who demanded compensation. Wu, due to his meager salary, was unable to repay, which led to a feeling of injustice and the thought of suicide. He wrote a suicide note, hid it on his person, went out and bought opium, and swallowed it. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1:30 PM, he went to the library on the stage of the Second Gate Theater of the City God Temple, sat on a chair, sighed and lamented. People nearby saw his face turn pale and asked him why. Wu just shook his head and wept. He was immediately reported to Constable Zhang Chenju of the Twenty-Fifth Post, who took Wu to the Second Sub-Bureau of the First District for investigation. Chief Inspector Chen questioned Wu Zhengyuan, but his answers were irrelevant and his nerves were disordered. A suicide note was found on Wu's person. Although the writing was incomprehensible, it was clear that he had taken poison and attempted suicide, and he seemed to be suffering from poisoning. A police chief was sent to take him to the Red Cross for rescue. However, the reason for the suicide is unknown. After he recovers, he will be reported to the District General Bureau for investigation and assistance.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 29th, "Ronglin Warehouse Resumes Work Under Police Protection by the Public Security Bureau," which states that the details mentioned are not factual. I am writing to request a correction as follows:</p>
<p>Our warehouse was rented to Yuchang Coal Company for storage in 1927 and renamed Ronglin Warehouse Yuji, with a contract stipulating that it would be returned at the end of July 1933 due to unpaid rent. We had Mr. Tao Jiachun, a lawyer, publish an announcement to clarify the situation. When Yuchang Coal Company rented the warehouse, Li Xiahong contracted to load and unload coal. Now that Ronglin Warehouse is operating on its own, it is reasonable to recruit our own loaders. We immediately advertised for bids, and the workers' representative, Qiu Antai, won the contract. This led to the obstruction of work by Li Xiahong, the foreman of Yuchang Coal Company, who almost resorted to violence. Fortunately, the Municipal Party Committee, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to mediate and decided to abolish any foreman system. Unexpectedly, shortly after the start of work, Li Xiahong came out to obstruct again, and a strike ensued. We immediately applied to handle the conclusion of all outstanding matters, entrusted to Yitaixing Nan Warehouse as an agent. However, Xie Peide, the manager of Yitaixing Nan Warehouse, still contracted with Li Xiahong under the foreman system, violating the Bureau of Social Affairs' instruction to abolish the foreman system. Our warehouse believes that this is related to the credibility of the Municipal Party Committee, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Public Security Bureau and is unwilling to recognize it. This time, all the workers requested to resume work due to livelihood issues. The Party and government agencies have repeatedly summoned both parties to mediate wages, but the foreman has repeatedly failed to appear. The Party and government agencies believe that the evil influence of a foreman cannot be allowed to hinder the work of the warehouse and endanger the lives of all workers. Therefore, the warehouse was approved to hire another foreman to continue work, and two teams of police officers were dispatched to the site to monitor and protect it, and unloading has resumed as usual. However, fearing that the reports are inaccurate, we are making this correction. I wish you well,</p>

<h3 id="e187">Fundraising Appeal for the Kalachakra Initiation Ceremony <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>In the past, when the Panchen Lama came north, he was invited to Hangzhou to preach the Dharma, but it did not come to fruition due to unripe conditions. In the summer of 1931, people in Peiping and Tianjin advocated for the construction of the Kalachakra assembly, and after years of preparation, it was held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the autumn of the following year. After seven days of completion, more than 100,000 people were initiated and received the Dharma, which was an unprecedented grand event in China. Benefactors in the southeast, due to the distance and obstacles, had few participants and their wishes were not fulfilled. Now that the master has come to Beijing, his colleagues have renewed their previous request and received a merciful approval, which is scheduled to be held at the Lingyin Ancient Temple in West Lake, starting on April 28 this year (March 15 of the lunar calendar), to initiate the Kalachakra Initiation Ceremony. Here, we will briefly explain its meaning to our ten-way good people. As the saying goes, blessings are born from a foundation, and misfortunes are born from a womb. Planting causes yields results, without the slightest deviation. This has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so today. In recent years, our country has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles, coming one after another. The suffering of the people exceeds that of the late Tang and Five Dynasties. Moreover, the powers are competing to expand their military preparations, weapons of destruction are being innovated every day, conventions are being broken, the economy is declining, and a world war is imminent. The future misery will be greater and wider than hundreds of times before. It can be said with certainty that the coming of this great disaster is due to the ripening of karmic retribution, and the reason for its invitation is due to the common cause. To try to save it, we must unite the masses of people to communicate with it. Therefore, in ancient times, when a disaster occurred, the superiors blamed themselves, and the subordinates cultivated and reflected, which was enough to inspire the harmony of heaven and eliminate the misfortune without shape. Today, the human heart is decaying, and without the blessing of the Buddha's power, there is no way to eliminate this vast catastrophe. The Kalachakra Sutra is the head of the five great vajras of the unsurpassed esoteric vehicle. It discusses the sun, moon, stars, and rocks on top, and the essence, qi, and meridians of the human body below. Those who master this sutra can verify the solar eclipse, the lunar eclipse, and the delay in the wind and rain by their own bodies, and they are all accurate. Its vastness and subtlety are truly inconceivable. Moreover, the six realms of sentient beings, when encountering this supreme cause, can obtain initiation even if they do not come to the altar to contemplate and visualize, or they can deeply plant the roots of the Buddha if they have not sought the Dharma in accordance with the rituals, but have only heard the sound of the bell, seen the altar rituals, or even heard the name of the Kalachakra Vajra. If those who have participated in this assembly and can sincerely visualize, and are covered by the guru's dedication, they will receive the benefits of the Dharma, regardless of distance. This is not only to eliminate disasters. According to the records of the great virtues of the Western Regions, the First Panchen Lama was once the head of the Shambhala, and he will be reborn in that land in the future. Now, inviting his incarnation to respond to the situation should have special merits and virtues. In the past, the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties supported the Lamas and presided over national affairs, which were established as examples. The Panchen Lama is the teacher of our country. In this time of frequent turmoil and universal terror, we should sincerely invite him to borrow the power of the Dharma to eliminate disasters for the country and pray for peace for the world. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a great amount of money, which cannot be accomplished by a small number of people. It should be requested that benefactors from all directions, regardless of country or race, contribute according to their ability and practice generosity, so that we can accumulate soil into mountains, and small streams return to the sea. We will plant the same good causes, eliminate common karma, turn disaster into good fortune, all in this move.</p>

<h3 id="e188">How to Study the Constitution <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>(1) Question</p>
<p>Reading Guidance</p>
<p>Recently, the government's Legislative Yuan released a draft constitution, hoping that everyone will offer opinions. I think we don't even understand what a constitution is, so how can we offer opinions? Sir, is it necessary for everyone to understand the constitution? What is the relationship between the constitution and the general public? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a good or bad constitution for the people? I hope to know all these things, but I don't know how to start studying it. Please give me an answer!</p>
<p>Lin Henwo, letter</p>
<p>(2) Answer</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's questions are indeed questions in the minds of the general public. Nowadays, most people are really too indifferent to politics. One of the reasons is that discussing state affairs often offends people, so according to the principle of "self-preservation," it is best to "not talk" about it. But this is not the biggest reason. The biggest reason is that in recent years, there have been too many political opinions, policies, political programs, etc. in opposition, and political facilities, etc. in power, and they all sound very nice and seem to have a lot of reasons. But until now, not only has the stable life that the general public needs not been achieved, but there is also the crisis of Japan's forcible seizure of Manchuria and Mongolia, France's occupation of the Nine Small Islands, and Britain's coveting of "Panhong," etc. There is also the personal pain of poverty, unemployment, hunger, and cold. As a result, the general public has become desperate and no longer wants to pay attention to all political propositions and facilities. This is right, but it is also wrong. The reason why it is right is that these propositions are an unfulfilled check, completely a set of manipulative tricks. But our politics, although bad, are not without hope of clarity, and our lives, although extremely painful, are not without a future of welfare. Therefore, it is a very serious mistake for us to be discouraged by politics and lose interest. It must be known that the more we do not study politics, the more opportunities there will be for all kinds of deceptive tricks, and the more practical theories that expose the truth will be despised, leading to a lack of clarity between right and wrong, and a confusion of black and white, and the worse the politics, the more painful our lives will be. Therefore, our attitude towards politics should not only be passive indifference, but also active research. Only in this way can we avoid being deceived by propaganda that distorts the facts, and only in this way can we recognize our future. We will never be pessimistic or depressed, but will have the determination to fight and work hard. Judging from Mr. Lin's letter, it seems that he still has a bit of an "indifferent" attitude towards studying politics, so I am taking this opportunity to discuss it.</p>
<p>What is a constitution? Let's not define it now, but first say what the content of the constitution is, what it includes, because knowing what the content of the constitution is, we will also know what the constitution is. The content of the constitution includes two kinds, one is substantive, and the other is formal. The formal content is to discuss the status of the constitution, the procedures for its enactment and amendment, and where it differs from ordinary laws. The substantive content is to talk about what the constitution is supposed to stipulate. The formal content has little to do with the constitution that we want to know, so let's put it aside for now. Of course, this does not mean that it has no relationship with the constitution or is not important. The substantive content of the constitution can be divided into three types: First, it stipulates the people's right to participate in politics, discussing whether the people have the right to actually manage the country, and the scope of that right. Second, the form of state power, which is divided into two aspects. One is to say the source of political power, or to whom it belongs, such as a minority or majority dictatorship, etc., and the relationship between the executive and the legislative. The other is to say the division of powers between the central and local governments. Third, are the main goals that the country wants to achieve, or in simpler terms, what the country wants to do. This part includes many of the country's basic laws, etc.</p>
<p>That is roughly what a constitution is, now let's talk about the method of studying the constitution.</p>
<p>First, studying the constitution should not only look at the meaning on paper, but should also observe whether it can be realized, that is, whether its ideals or goals have the possibility of being realized in the society at that time. In other words, we must study the essence of the content of the constitution, and not be deceived by its rhetoric.</p>
<p>Ordinary capitalist countries boast of democratic politics. Whether it is a republic or a constitutional monarchy, the constitution stipulates that everyone has the right to participate in politics, everyone is equal under the law, and everyone has freedom of assembly, association, publication, and speech. But what is the reality? Still, the rich and powerful hold the political power, and the rulers are still a class of literati and officials. In so-called democratic or constitutional monarchy countries, elections are manipulated by a group of political parties, which flaunt various political programs and policies for the country and the people in order to win over voters and compete in elections. In fact, they are only loyally serving a minority of people, and the political programs and policies are just a facade. However, the elected representatives cannot do without them. Therefore, it is very easy for a minority of people in society to monopolize political power in order to oppress the majority. They can buy some political parties, or send people to organize some political parties and let them campaign and strive for political power. If these political parties are in power, then those few people, although they appear to be the same as ordinary people on the surface, without any special privileges, can actually influence the politics of a country. Therefore, the sovereignty of the people as a whole, as stipulated in the constitution, is a bowl of hypnotic soup, an attempt to cover up the mask of a minority monopolizing the political machine.

<h3 id="e189">I Have a Few Words to Say (Continued) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Lean Wren</p>
<p>We are originally very welcoming of anecdotes about famous people. But for some reason? Every time we publish a passage about the anecdotes of great men and gentlemen, it always has to be passively corrected the next day. The author thinks it is hearsay about morality and can be used as material; the editor thinks it can be used as a topic of conversation after tea and wine; both parties have no intention and no effect. However, based on my many years of editing experience, this kind of anecdote about great men and gentlemen is really debatable and un-debatable; publishable and un-publishable. Some readers may think it is sucking up or bootlicking, while the great men and gentlemen themselves think it is a joke, scolding the mountain gate. Therefore, from now on, we will no longer welcome anecdotes about contemporary celebrities, and it is better to be "careful of fire" ourselves than to cause trouble.</p>
<p>In the bottom row, don't we often have things like "Travels," "Women's Corner," "World Wonders," and "Small Recipes?" There are many such categories. In addition to the four types mentioned above, there are also ten types such as "Scientific Anecdotes," "Small Knowledge," "Short Stories," "Laughter Mobilization," "Miscellaneous Talks," "Local Chronicles," "Small Gardening," "Small Handicrafts," "One-Act Plays," and "Mini-Novels." All novel and meaningful materials are welcomed. However, the number of words in each type is limited to a maximum of 1,000 words, because if there are too many, they will be arranged in densely packed layers, like ants carrying dead flies, which is too ugly, and the old gentlemen whose eyesight has been discounted can only sigh at the "words."</p>
<p>Comics were originally published once a week in the bottom row, usually with four or five pictures together. Now we also plan to change it to one picture per day. For example, eating a table of assorted dishes every week, although it feels rich, is not as appetizing as eating the same delicacy every day. In addition to Huang Shiying, Zhang Yingchao, and Jiang Dongliang, who are responsible for this type of comics, submissions are also welcome. The title pictures are best in the form of patterns, and the size must be three-quarters larger than the current size set by this publication, so that it can be reduced for plate making.</p>
<p>Whether it is a manuscript or a painting, the author's name and address must be indicated, and a seal must be affixed. The number of words must be indicated on the manuscript. These three things are considered the three chapters of the law between this publication and the authors. If you are unwilling to comply, then after publication, remuneration will be discussed later, and I will not be polite. (Attached statement: Whether or not the submitted manuscripts are published, they will not be returned.) At the beginning of the transformation of "Spring and Autumn," the book "Memoirs of the Court of Peking," translated by Qin Shouou, is specially published as a memorial. This book was written in English by Princess Der Ling of the former Qing Dynasty, also known as "The Old Buddha's Era of the Empress Dowager Cixi," and records the secret history of the Qing Palace at that time, which is very interesting. Mr. Qin is originally a famous novelist, and his translation is also exquisite and pleasing, and he does not lose the original meaning at all. The purpose of our publishing this book is not to make readers feel any "ancient sentiment," but just like inviting everyone to watch Mei Lanfang perform a "Taizhen Biography" on stage.</p>
<p>"Spring and Autumn" is about to change. But from which day does it start to change? Well! April 1, 1934 (The Children's Weekly that should have been published on this day will be moved to Children's Day on April 4).</p>

<p>— Dew</p>
<p>This title is very witty, and some people may regard it as a witty story. In fact, the author wrote it with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a certain lady sent a letter to the editor of the local supplement of this newspaper. She said, "......I am a vase in a certain office. Among several vases, that ×× actually took a fancy to me. ......He came to flirt with me twice last year, but I cleverly avoided them. ......Now he has gone a step further and opened a hotel room. ......I struggled all night, but I didn't succumb. ......If I resign from this position? I will have to watch my parents, brothers and sisters starve! ......So I think I can only take the path of Ms. Ai Xia. ......" After reading this record, we can know that women's occupation is really a serious problem today. For the lawlessness of a certain ××, not only is his personal character bankrupt, but he is also one of the major criminals who destroy women's occupation. However, let's not talk about him here for the time being.</p>
<p>In this era, it is too unlucky to be a woman. Especially those with beautiful looks are even more dangerous. So how unfortunate is the production of the word "vase", and how painful it is! However, the vase is ultimately something for people to appreciate, and there is a warning of "can be seen but not moved" in this meaning. At best, it can only be said that it is "impractical." I think Ms. So-and-so, it is better to comfort yourself well and not take the path of Ms. Ai Xia! Because what I have is two treasures, one is life and the other is the soul. As long as I don't sell my soul, the harm to my life, the blows to my mind, and the difficulties in life are nothing! If you sell your soul, then there is no place to say the bitterness!</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that working women will broaden your horizons in the future, prepare your true knowledge, and study more professional skills. On the one hand, you should also be frugal and not raise your life above your level. In this way, you will no longer be a vase, and no one will drink the water in the vase as tea! Otherwise, even if you are not a vase, you will get other patterns!</p>

<p>Ms. Jiang also saw that her aunt's face was yellow and said that she was not sick, but she seemed to be sick. Probably she was not feeling well, so it would be good to let her go out for a walk. As for Guizhi? She was also full of complaints and had no way to vent them. Being able to find someone to talk to and tell the words in her stomach might make her feel better, so she agreed to the words of the two old people, and the next day she went into the city alone to meet Manying. When she arrived at the Huang family, it was a very deep stimulus for her. Originally, because she was too familiar with the Huang family, she did not follow the rules of northern families, knocking on the door knocker honestly, but rushed into the yard. The Huang family lived in a front yard of someone else's house, with two rooms facing south, one as a living room and one as Manying's study. Guizhi did not dare to go to the upper room again, first coughed twice in the yard, and then opened the door of the living room and called out, "Is Miss Huang at home?" When she stretched her head in to look, she saw Huang Manying smiling and talking with a young man in a suit, holding a corner of the table. Guizhi was stunned holding the door, should she go in or not? Manying saw her, but she didn't care at all, and stood up with the man to welcome her and said, "What wind brought you here today?" Guizhi saw that she was still so nonchalant, so she walked in with a red face. Manying introduced the man and said, "This is my cousin Qin Jun." Guizhi also oh-ed and nodded to sit down. But she thought in her heart, I have been friends with you for so long, how come I never heard of any cousin? At that time, she calmed down on her face and did not express her attitude. She also thought in her heart that she should be sensible and not talk about Company Commander Tian in front of her cousin. But Manji was also strange, and she never asked him a word, has Company Commander Zhao sent a letter? (349)</p>
<h3 id="e192">Research on Inkstones (10) (3) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>

<p>▲ Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>(3) Stone Flaws: The history of inkstones lists fifteen kinds of stone flaws. However, many of these fifteen kinds have gradually become beautiful patterns due to the shift in aesthetic psychology. Generally, it is because the flaws are hard and do not affect the ink in the ink pool, and the patterns are indeed worth seeing; or because the flaws do not change the nature of the stone at all and can increase the beauty; or because the flaws are unique to the lower cliff or the Da Xi Cave and can be used as proof of a good stone. Inkstone lovers observe this kind of stone from various aspects and only feel that it is valuable and not a disease. This is the reason why stone flaws become beautiful patterns. Try to record the stone flaws separately.</p>
<p>(A) Stone flaws that are called beautiful patterns</p>
<p>1. Emerald Pattern: Congealed green like sprinkled juice, also known as emerald dots, there are two kinds of heavy green and light green, with the same veins as the eye, only yellow-green is not enough weight, green is loved by everyone. 2. Yellow Dragon Pattern: Grayish yellow like a dragon and snake slanting on the stone is called Yellow Dragon. The color is burnt and astringent and contains earthy gas, and it is a stone disease if it is horizontal in the heart of the inkstone. If it is bright and reveals the light of golden sand, or is hidden in the shape of a small golden circle, it is very beautiful.</p>
<p>2. Jade Belt: White and solidified green that is slender and long, or pure white, is called Jade Belt. It is mellow, clean, and extremely beautiful. There is also a white stripe that is about twice the size of a gold and silver thread, called a white stripe pattern. A slight tinge of tender green is called a green stripe pattern, which are all kinds of jade belts.</p>
<p>3. Jade Dot: A white dot as large as a mung bean is called a jade dot, also known as a pomegranate kernel. It is very difficult to obtain if it is refined, crystal clear, tender, and moist. 5. Gold and Silver Thread: Occasionally one or two threads are seen on the inkstone surface. The veins are yellow, which is called a gold thread pattern, and the white is called a silver thread pattern. Scholars love those that are fine and do not damage the hairs, but those that are rough are not taken.</p>
<p>4. Sparrow Spots: Spots similar to ink scars are called sparrow spots, also known as partridge spots. The spots are purple-brown and quite spectacular. If the spots are slightly longer and form dense rows like sparrow spots, they are called pine bark patterns, which are medium and second-class products.</p>
<p>5. Five-Colored Nails: There are two kinds of five-colored nails, white and green. Although they are firm and resistant to blades, they are only found in the Da Xi Cave, and they are even more valuable because they are glittering with precious light. The history of inkstones also has so-called cinnabar nails, also known as cinnabar spots, which are bright and colorful, and are most valuable if they are not in the ink pool (Da Xi Cave is especially bright and moist). They are classified as five-colored nails, so they are attached to it.</p>
<p>6. Worm-eaten: Peeling like insect bites (called drilling in the Song Dynasty) is caused by water erosion into holes of different sizes, which is enough to prove the tenderness and moistness of the stone. It is quite interesting if it is outside the ink pool, so scholars value it.</p>
<p>According to other books, there are also so-called ancient spots, cedar patterns, and blood edges, which are all medium and second-class beautiful patterns. There is also a kind of hawksbill spot, which is blue-purple like a turtle shell and has deep purple spots. It is found in the stones of the late Song Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty. The Japanese value it most and call it the Jishui Cliff, which is also rare.</p>
<p>(B) Real Stone Flaws</p>
<p>There are several stone flaws that are really annoying. 1. Iron Thread: It can be broken easily when chiseling it at the skin gap. 2. Water Thread: Like a hard crack. Also known as warning lines. 3. Pig Bristle Eyes: Like the pores of plucked pig bristles, the stone texture does not condense. 4. Oil-Slick Light: Also written as dragonfly light, like oil on the surface of water, it is firm, slippery, and does not accept ink. This is the biggest disease of the old pit. 5. Sand Nail: As big as a finger, it is stubborn and hard like a nail, which is different from the five-colored nail.</p>

<h3 id="e193">The Sorrow of the Old Yellow Ox (Continued) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Mingdao</p>
<p>"Silly girl, do you love that old yellow ox so much? What's the benefit of raising it at home until it dies?" "Don't cry, if your father hears you, he will scold you."</p>
<p>Her mother wiped away her tears for her and comforted her, but she would never forget this in her weak heart.</p>
<p>One night passed.</p>
<p>In the morning when the red sun was just rising, A-Shuisheng and Yinbao's mother were about to eat breakfast, but they couldn't find Yinbao. The two of them searched everywhere, and when they walked to the cowshed, they saw Yinbao squatting in front of the old yellow ox, staring at it with a flaw. The old yellow ox was lying on the ground, panting in its mouth, its eyes wide open, and it was also looking at Yinbao.</p>
<p>A-Shuisheng shouted strangely, "Yinbao, why don't you go to eat breakfast? You hid here early in the morning to see the sick ox. Today, it is going to leave us!"</p>
<p>Yinbao squatted on the ground and said to A-Shuisheng, "Dad, is the old yellow ox going to leave us today? But is it sold? It has been with us for many years, and I really can't bear it. It is already sick, and if it is sold to others to be slaughtered, wouldn't it be a sin? Dad, please spare it! Let it live in our house again."</p>
<p>These words, Yinbao seemed to say very pitifully, but unexpectedly touched his father's anger, pulled up his face, and shouted in a refined and violent voice, "What do you kids know! This is an adult's business, and it has nothing to do with you kids. Do you know that your dad has no money to use? In this year, people are also sold, let alone an ox; not to mention an old yellow ox that is sick and about to die and has no strength to cultivate the field! Go to the house quickly, don't nag."</p>
<p>Father's majesty? Yinbao has always known it. He cried with a sad face and dared not say anything more. His mother hugged him and walked towards the house, fearing that A-Shuisheng's old fist would be waved out and Yinbao would be beaten severely.</p>
<p>Before lunch, A-Shuisheng's aunt suddenly came to see the couple from a nearby village. After meeting, she told them the story in detail. It turned out that A-Shuisheng's aunt's husband, A-Kui, had been sick in bed for several days, and his illness was very serious, which made her unable to think of anything, so she had to run here to discuss it.</p>
<p>A-Shuisheng sat impatiently listening to his aunt talk, he just scratched his head, expressing a helpless look.</p>
<p>His aunt was very disappointed and almost cried. So, Yinbao's mother couldn't help but say, "A-Shuisheng, lend five dollars to your aunt. She will have a meeting fee to pay in March next year. I know this is the first meeting of the Zhao family."</p>
<p>So A-Shuisheng nodded and agreed.</p>
<p>The couple invited their aunt to have lunch here, and the customer who bought the ox came. A-Shuisheng first led him to the cowshed to see it, and then came back and sat down. The price had already been negotiated. The customer was a Shandong native, and he took out the snow-white silver dollars very happily and gave them all to A-Shuisheng. A-Shuisheng took it and let the Shandong native lead the sick old yellow ox away.</p>
<p>When the old yellow ox was led out of the cowshed, strangely enough, although it was a beast, it seemed to have spirituality. Knowing that its last day had come, it wailed and resisted, unwilling to leave its owner, its old home, 丨丨丨 the dilapidated cowshed. Yinbao was watching blankly from the side, although he dared not sound in his mouth, how sad he was in his heart! A bag of tears was already full in his small eyes.</p>
<p>In the end, the poor sick old yellow ox followed the Shandong native and left its owner, its old home, its little friend 丨丨 Yinbao. Alas! The slaughterhouse is the place where its lifelong hard work will end! A-Shuisheng's aunt also borrowed five silver dollars and hurried home to save her husband. When she was walking on the road, she thought to herself, when the ox is old and sick, it can still be sold for some money to use, but what about people? Is it possible that people are not as good as oxen?</p>
<p>A-Shuisheng and his wife got the money from selling the ox and discussed how to allocate their uses. Fortunately, they already had the capital to buy a new ox next year. Their plan can temporarily be worry-free.</p>
<p>Yinbao hid in the corner of the room and secretly shed tears, and it can be said that only he understood the sorrow of the old yellow ox.</p>

<p>Pseudo-Organization Participates in the Far Eastern Games</p>
<h3 id="e194">Our Country Consistently Refuses <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>National Sports Association Issues Important Statement</p>
<p>▲ The Sports Association Yesterday Telegraphically Replied to Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</p>
<p>▲ Shen Siliang Denies Allowing Individuals to Participate</p>
<p>The Chinese National Sports Promotion Association, in order to express that our country has always firmly refused the participation of pseudo-organizations in the Far Eastern Games, yesterday specially issued the following announcement:</p>
<p>Recently, news reports have repeatedly seen the matter of Manchuria participating in the Far Eastern Games. There are many discussions, and there is no consensus. All of them are the creation of a certain party to confuse the public. The National Sports Promotion Association has already resolutely refused and has not shown any signs of retreat. The so-called tripartite meeting held in Shanghai is also of the nature of an executive meeting. The Association had specially telegraphed the Philippine Association in advance that the issue of Manchuria's participation should not be raised for discussion when the Association was held in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ The Association Telegraphed a Reply to Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Association received a telegram from the New China Daily in Manila, inquiring about Manchuria's request to join the Far Eastern Games. After receiving the telegram, the Association immediately replied as follows: "To the New China Daily in Manila, our country has always refused Manchuria to join the Far Eastern Games and has not shown any signs of retreat. National Sports Association, Yan"</p>
<p>▲ Scope of Round Table Conference Discussions</p>
<p>The reporter from the Shishi News Agency visited Mr. Shen Siliang, the main leader of the Sports Association, yesterday. According to Mr. Shen, this round table conference is a kind of ordinary meeting, discussing the various procedures for the current Far Eastern Games. The meeting discussed the scope of the general championship of the conference, and various important cases where friendly matches should be changed to championship matches. It is held as usual before each session and has no other effect. The outside world has been misunderstood due to false rumors and believes that the round table conference, the content is how and how, all belong to speculation. As for the meeting period, it can only be decided after the Philippine and Japanese representatives arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Denial of Allowing Individuals to Participate</p>
<p>Mr. Shen continued, if the Japanese side raises the issue of pseudo-organizations participating, we will seriously refuse, and even withdraw voluntarily, which we will not hesitate to do. The outside world has said that there is a saying of allowing individuals from the pseudo-country to participate, which is unfounded and unpredictable. It is thought that it is all the smoke screen of the Japanese people's false claims of deception (according to Zhang Jiong, director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, who gave a speech in Beijing on the 27th, saying that if they come to participate in the Far Eastern Games in the name of the pseudo-country, our country will definitely insist, but if they participate as individuals and there is no pseudo-country name, then they will of course be allowed to join). Our authorities are determined to uphold the principle of not losing power and humiliating the country. As for the telegram from the overseas Chinese in Manila, this Association has replied with an explanation.</p>
<p>▲ All Sectors Generously Agreed to Donate Funds</p>
<p>Mr. Shen continued, this Association is now actively preparing for the various procedures for the Far Eastern Games and pre-selection. We previously raised funds from the Shandong Military and Political Authorities and received generous support from all sectors. The future is very optimistic and we have received more than 10,000 yuan in donations. As for the preparations for the pre-selection, the committee is scheduled to meet on April 10 and has now notified all committee members to come to Shanghai to attend.</p>

<p>In the national men's and women's track and field highest records for the year 22 of the Republic of China, announced by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, the following questions have been discovered: (1) In last year's 17th North China Games, the men's high jump performance of Ji Wu Bixian was 1.82 meters, which is better than the 1.81 meters achieved by Hu Gu Huo in last year's National Games. (2) In last year's 3rd Shanghai City Games, the women's javelin performance of Chen Rongming was 27.75 meters, which is better than Chen's own 26.38 meters in last year's National Games. (3) In last year's 3rd Shanghai City Games, the women's long jump performance of Qian Hangsu was 4.88 meters, which is better than Li Yuanfen's 4.795 meters in last year's National Games.  For the above three items, the performances exceeding the announced highest records, is it because they could not be established for other reasons, or were they omitted due to reports or collections from various parties? In addition, there are Liu Changchun's 22 seconds flat in the 200-meter preliminary round of the National Games, Zhao Yunshan's 13.4 seconds in the women's 100-meter preliminary round, and Qian Hangsu's 14.3 seconds in the women's 80-meter hurdles preliminary round. Were these preliminary round performances established, or were they not counted for other reasons?  The Athletic Federation should provide explanations to dispel public doubts.</p>

<p>The Jinling University basketball team played its first game against Datong yesterday afternoon at the Datong basketball court, as part of a makeup game for Jiangnan University basketball. The game was evenly matched and fiercely contested. In the first half, both sides defended tightly, making it difficult to score. The score was 8 to 6, with Datong leading by two points. As the second half began, Datong's players suddenly gained momentum. Ren Jiexing and Chen Zhaoqiu weaved through the defense, unstoppable, and scored repeatedly. Jinling was unable to defend, and the situation deteriorated. In the last five minutes, Datong substituted in their second-string players, and Jinling still showed no improvement. In the end, Datong won a great victory with a score of 35 to 15. The referee was Lu Xiangqian. Today at 3 p.m., Jinling will play Guanghua again at Guanghua.

<p>Defeats South China Three to Zero</p>
<p>(Hong Kong News) Last Saturday (the 24th), the Special Silver Shield final was held, with South China A and Welsh competing. This game was the championship match, so-called success or failure, all depend on this one move, so Hong Kong and Chinese fans are very excited, crowded and very much, all want to see the South China triumphal song. Unexpectedly, the result of the competition, Nanyang was defeated by zero to three, not only the championship was handed over to Welsh, but also suffered the taste of an egg, at the same time disappointed all Hong Kong fans, this is the South China has made the champion hope of this session of the regular cup into a bubble, now send the special silver medal to others, I don't want to say it. In this game, South China's left-winger Ye Beihua was absent from the battle due to an incident, and Wu Baoqu of Group B supplemented his absence, so the lineup was greatly inferior. The five tigers of the forward line were often inaccurate in passing the ball, as if they had lost control. The lack of power in shooting, the lack of courage in the offensive, and the loss of opportunity were even more superfluous. The entire team, except for Li Tiansheng, performed abnormally, so South China's defeat was justified. On the other hand, the Welsh team, 11 players, had close contact and passed the ball quickly, so their victory over South China was really a level higher, not lucky. The players who played in the game for both sides:</p>

<h3 id="e208">Establishment Declaration <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The rise and fall of a country, the prosperity and decline of a nation, are tied to culture. Only with the continuous replacement of the old and production of the new in culture can both the country and the nation achieve their boundless and unprecedented development. Our Chinese nation has stood for five thousand years. Tracing back to the times of Fuxi and Shennong, our ancestors had creations in every generation. The Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties were passed down from the ancient sages, and the cultural relics and systems were brilliant and well-prepared. In terms of the long history of culture, the world rarely has its equal. It is not just the pre-Qin scholars who formed the glory of the country. The reputation of the Han and Tang Dynasties spread far to foreign lands. Even today, the national situation is deeply troubled, but this Chinese nation of 470 million people is still linked by the same cultural belt. As for the neighboring countries that have been nurtured by this culture, there are the Japanese, Siamese, Korean, and Annamese peoples. If our people do not slack in the work of replacing the old and producing the new, it will not be difficult for our country's culture to surpass all other cultures. What is a pity is that in the past 100 years, cultural evolution and elimination have been worrying. Some stick to the old ways and others blindly embrace new ways. Some stop in the middle, while others rush to a dead end. The former cling to the past and do not know the new, nearly holding onto the remnants and guarding the gaps. How can it be possible to promote and carry forward the culture? The latter know hunger but do not choose food, which is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. Thought poisoning is even more tragic. As a result, culture has declined, the country has lost its vitality, the nation has lost its lively and enterprising spirit, and society has fallen into a corrupt and degenerate situation. Although there was a political revolution in 1911, it did not help the backwardness of culture. At this time of survival and the interruption of traditions, if we do not urgently engage in the new construction of Chinese culture, can the country and nation have any hope of revival? This is why the Chinese Cultural Construction Association was established. However, the new construction of Chinese culture should be tailored to the needs of the times. It is necessary to ensure that the construction of the new Chinese culture and the creation of a new national life complement each other. Then, the replacement of the old and production of the new in culture will be sufficient to be a tool for generating national power, and the regeneration and transformation of national life will be sufficient to be a factor in the development of culture. Only by advancing on both fronts can we pull this country and nation through the dangerous and difficult path of danger and gradually move toward the open path of unity and revival. This association believes that cultural undertakings are undertakings that benefit both the past and the future in national life. The construction of a new culture is measured only by what the new life needs. Therefore, promoting and carrying forward the inherent culture is an urgent task, and absorbing and integrating foreign culture is also necessary. Those who adhere to the old should adhere to what they should adhere to. Respecting the dregs of the previous generation, even if they are approved by the ancient sages, should be discarded like legacy. Those who innovate should innovate what they should innovate. If it is not permitted by the national conditions, then even if it is popular in the world, it must be hated like an enemy. Only in this way can those engaged in the cultural movement be able to not forget the Chinese nation at this time and in this place, and be able to cut through thorns and open up a bright opportunity for our country and nation. Moreover, in all undertakings, there must be something to take and something to give up. Taking the true depends on the courage to give up. Today, in order to complete the great cause of revitalizing the country and the nation, what is needed is the active construction of culture, and at the same time, we must devote ourselves to passive destruction. Pearls and gravel can stand for a long time, but fragrant herbs and stinking weeds must interfere with each other. If you want to accomplish the work of cultivation, you should have the power of weeding. It is sufficient to speak from a negative point of view. Eliminating the remnants of feudal consciousness, sweeping away the ideas of class struggle, saving the decadent atmosphere, and correcting the habits of slaves are all urgent tasks. Destroying the fortifications and eliminating the source requires strength. From a positive point of view, promoting the national spirit, advocating scientific knowledge, promoting the unified life of the group, and honing the great creative perseverance are all the demands of the times. This association is willing to work with the people of the country to jointly undertake them. It is hoped that the small intention will be believed by comrades and understood by the people of the country. Not only will our national culture have a bright future, but the revival of the country and the nation can also be expected in the near future. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>=Sports Field Construction to Begin in June and Be Completed Next Summer=</p>
<p>=Museum Design Approved, Construction to Begin Within the Year=</p>
<p>=Financial Bureau Actively Planning Funding=</p>
<p>Following the Shanghai Municipal Government's relocation to the city center area, it is actively proceeding with the implementation of the Greater Shanghai Plan. It has now been decided that the Municipal Grand Sports Field and the Museum, which are part of the Phase II project, will begin construction in June of this year, one after the other. The project is budgeted at 2 million yuan, which will be raised by the Municipal Finance Bureau through the issuance of public bonds or a type of exchangeable bond. The project will begin after the proposal is submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion and approval. The construction plan for the Qiujiang Wharf has also been reviewed and completed by Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau. Our reporter has made special inquiries and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>▲Scheduled Start of Sports Field Construction: The existing First Park site in the city center area will be expanded to build a large-scale sports field. The field will cover an area of 300 acres, and its various facilities will be the most complete in the country. The entire plan has been completed. According to sources from the City Center Area Architect's Office, it has been decided that construction of the field will begin in June of this year, and bidding and other work will begin soon. Construction must be completed before the summer of next year so that the National Games in 1935 and the Far Eastern Games in 1936 can be held at the field, and therefore, no further delays can be tolerated.</p>
<p>▲Museum Design Approved: The construction of the Municipal Museum, which was decided by the Municipal Government as part of the Phase II plan for the city center area, is also scheduled to be implemented within this year. The design for the museum was previously drafted, but due to some changes, it was redesigned by architect Dong Dayou to meet practical needs. The design for the museum has now been completed and has been discussed and approved by the Municipal Museum and Library Preparatory Committee at a meeting. After some minor revisions in the coming days, it will be completely finalized. The exterior will still be in the palace style with Chinese artistic elements, and it will be quite magnificent and beautiful. The museum will begin construction within this year, following the sports field.</p>
<p>▲Finance Bureau to Raise Funds: The funds for the realization of the above-mentioned construction projects are being actively planned by Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau. However, given the city's extremely difficult financial situation, the Municipal Government itself will find it difficult to bear the full burden for the time being. After discussions among the directors of the Municipal Government's various bureaus, it was decided that the Municipal Finance Bureau should plan to borrow from the banking sector or issue bonds. The methods under consideration include: (1) the Municipal Government borrowing from the financial sector, with the Municipal Treasury allocating funds for repayment in installments; (2) issuing municipal public bonds; (3) issuing a type of exchangeable bond, allowing citizens to directly purchase the bonds, which can then be used to pay municipal taxes and duties in full. It is said that the amount is 3 million yuan, which will be used for the sports field and museum. The planning for the museum's furnishings and equipment is to be postponed. After deliberation and decision on the above methods, they will be submitted to the Municipal Council for formal implementation and approval.</p>

<p>— Ah Dai</p>
<p>Interacting with words is called "discussion," directly speaking is called "saying." Since no one is talking about it, I will speak directly. In other words, this "saying" is the "I gave him a talking to" kind of saying, the saying of right and wrong, the saying of gossip. It contains the meaning of criticizing, inciting, and persuading. Editors encompass all editors of newspapers, magazines, regular publications, and irregular publications in the world. What is there to say about editors? I will now say it below...</p>
<p>The literary world is currently abuzz with the "He Xu authorship issue." The "Beijing School" considers it a disgrace to the "Shanghai School," taking the manuscript of an unestablished writer and attaching an established name to submit it to a publication, as if opening a factory or running an exchange. But one is willing to give away, and the other is willing to receive; one simply doesn't want to be named, doesn't want royalties, and the other simply wants to take the credit, wants to take other people's manuscripts, and also take responsibility for the writing. We won't delve into their rights and wrongs. What I want to say here is... a group of editors cannot avoid taking some responsibility for this matter.</p>
<p>Manuscripts by writers without fame do not receive the favor of editors. This is a universal lament. But editors are not dormitory supervisors, and the court has not entrusted them with evaluating and selecting talents. Why so harshly dismiss all new writers? It is said that a certain magazine company once moved (this was a long time ago), and workers carried out six or seven boxes, all filled with unsolicited manuscripts, still sealed in their original envelopes, with the words "Unread" written on them! This is probably called "Even with seven boxes, it doesn't make a newspaper."</p>
<p>Even for editor-gentlemen who are humble and willing to accept good advice, they establish their own opinions and revise manuscripts into a complete mess. For example, when giving someone a flower, it is protected with green leaves. The editor likes this one flower and removes all the branches and leaves because he is "limited by space." Or they subtly delete one or two words in crucial places, like a painting of a beautiful woman that has already undergone the artist's painstaking efforts, but they take colored paint and smear it on the expressive eyes, a slight change that alters the entire view. Even when they easily let it pass, they are not satisfied and must add an editor's note or repeatedly praise it, thus wronging the author, misinterpreting the original meaning, and causing discouragement. Or they split up a work that clearly cannot be divided and publish it in parts; or they deliberately place the manuscript in an inappropriate position...</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that the current mess of authorship involving He and Xu originates from the shame of modern editors. Manuscripts by unknown writers have no way of appearing. Countless talented works are silently submerged! Everyone is following the old ways, agreeing with each other, without feeling the mission of their work in an era of culture!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Changsha Sesame Twist <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>It was a quiet, late night. I was awakened by the noisy sound of a huqin, and the lamplight coming in from the street lamp was so dim and desolate that it was frightening. Looking out from the window, the sky was pitch black, without even a tiny star. The two pots of orchids placed on the windowsill looked like a pair of disheveled wild ghosts. I stared, rubbing my eyes with extra effort. The disheveled hair seemed to be blown by a storm, rushing towards me. I was a little scared and quickly pulled my head back under the covers. Who knew that the disheveled hair would turn into two huge black shadows, walking towards me step by step? I tightly covered my head with the blanket, holding a heart that was beating wildly.</p>
<p>The black shadows were actually pressing down on my body, and I felt extremely difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>"Don't scare yourself. Those are two pots of orchids. Where are there any ghosts?"</p>
<p>Clearly, something in my mind seemed to be telling me not to have such unconscious fantasies.</p>
<p>But I broke out in a cold sweat, and my clothes were soaked. I still dared not stick my head out. "Changsha sesame twist, white sugar rice flower." [Note 1]</p>
<p>I vaguely heard this cry that I was used to hearing every night, and I seemed to gain courage. I stuck my head out, and the black shadows of the orchids seemed even more terrifying. They looked like a hideous face, almost like a yaksha. I quickly turned my head away and thought carefully.</p>
<p>At this moment, I was completely awake!</p>
<p>Orchid was originally the name of a friend, and it contained a particularly profound meaning. Unfortunately, he had just died a month ago. When I bought the orchids, I never dreamed that he would die so quickly, so tragically.</p>
<p>Could it be that his soul had come tonight?</p>
<p>I became a little superstitious. Yes, a person will always unconsciously fall into the circle of superstition at some point.</p>
<p>The cry of "Changsha sesame twist, white sugar rice flower" was getting closer and closer. The bell of the wonton seller was also ringing. Strangely, they seemed to be standing still under my window, calling and ringing.</p>
<p>I began to feel annoyed. I felt that they shouldn't be disturbing people's sleep. If I hadn't been awakened by the huqin player, wouldn't I be in sweet dreams right now? And I wouldn't have discovered the terrible black shadows on the windowsill.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I became even more annoyed.</p>
<p>"Yali," [Note 2] "did you make a lot of money tonight?"</p>
<p>They began to talk, and I knew that this was the wonton seller asking the child selling sesame twists.</p>
<p>"Not even two hundred cash. How can I go home like this?"</p>
<p>"There's no business. I've never gone out as soon as it gets dark, and I've only made a little over a dime by now. It's too cold these past two days, and people are sleeping early, so there's no business."</p>
<p>"What cold or not cold, people with money have stoves burning at home, so they're warm and comfortable even if it snows. They play cards until dawn and have concubines serving them cigarettes, and servants and maids pouring tea next to them. Yali, why don't you go to the entrance of the big mansions?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! Big mansions? They won't eat your bowl of wontons. They have sea cucumbers and bird's nest at home."</p>
<p>"Yali, stop complaining here and hurry up! It's almost dawn!"</p>
<p>"Changsha sesame twist, white sugar rice flower..." This sound faded far away in the air like sad music, and the sound of the bell also disappeared with it.</p>
<p>[Note 1] Both are types of candy, specialties of Changsha.</p>
<p>[Note 2] Yali is a term for child.</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I just came from the countryside. You don't need me to say a word. You only need to look at my face or smell my clothes. I truly know everything there, know everything, like a child knows their mother. He knows clearly how long is the hair on her body. What do you want to ask? Are you asking about the hazy willows on the long embankment in the misty rain of the Qingming Festival? Or the peach blossoms reflecting on the cheeks of girls in the setting sun and spring breeze? Ask about the coolness seeping out of the mountain stream in the hot summer, bats flying around the ancient temple in the hazy dusk? What else do you want to ask? Ask about the beauty of the autumn mountains, the rolling clouds in the autumn wind, the desolate coolness of the setting sun on the boundless wilderness? I know you want to ask about the eight crowing sounds of the rooster in the winter night, an old woman rocking a spinning wheel, watching a dim little lamp. You want to ask this, I am all familiar with this, but what I want to tell you are some other things. Don't be alarmed after listening, and there's no need to sigh. That makes you seem so ignorant. I'm telling you, the villagers in the countryside are now tightening their belts and enduring the depths of spring. They haven't let down their guard. In the wind and cold, they bury their bodies on the slopes. They sow seeds in the spring, planting them in the earth, but they no longer sow hope as they used to. You can tell a dispirited heart just by the sound of urging the cattle! They work, no longer singing joyful songs, and even the smoke from their work-relieving cigarettes doesn't bring out ease. This can't be blamed on them. A body turns with the sun and moon, and in the end, three intestines are empty, one and a half empty! The stories in the mouth of an eighty-year-old woman are no longer ancient heroes, but themselves. They say they saw the Taiping Rebellion with their own eyes, but they've never seen a year like this! Relying on the five grains can't be exchanged for money, there's either war or floods. As soon as the sun sets, panic comes. They rest their heads on pillows and hear it until dawn. The endless varieties of taxes are like a blood basin, licking dry the joy of the countryside and sucking up the flesh and blood of the poor! I'm telling you, the countryside today is a bomb, inside which is brewing the fire of explosion. × × ×</p>

<p>— Le Bin</p>
<p>丨丨One of Ancient Anecdotes丨丨</p>
<p>"As long as you are willing to be my wife, not only will I pardon your crime, but I can give you whatever you want."</p>
<p>The general was captivated by the woman's beauty. After dismissing all the attendants, he gently loosened her bonds, while saying in a low and earnest voice.</p>
<p>The woman tilted her disheveled head and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Lower your voice. Please lower your voice!"</p>
<p>The general panicked and looked anxiously outside the curtain... Red bonfires dotted the peaks far and near... The soldiers' lewd songs rang out in the forest on the slope.</p>
<p>The woman suppressed her laughter and said...</p>
<p>"Then, are you willing to lead your troops for me and be my follower?"</p>
<p>"I am willing, I am willing... Isn't it the same whether you lead them or I lead them?"</p>
<p>The general shouted with joy; the shadow of his excited arm danced on the curtain. "No, if I lead your troops, I won't be as... as you!"</p>
<p>The woman glanced at the brightly burning silver candles on the table and refuted casually.</p>
<p>The general understood what she meant. He stopped loosening the ropes and asked with a look of pity...</p>
<p>"Why don't you ever change your mind and always oppose them?"</p>
<p>The woman became serious and said frankly... "Because as long as they exist, others simply cannot survive!"</p>
<p>The general scratched his bald head with difficulty, remained silent for a while, and then pleaded softly again...</p>
<p>"Can't you ask for something else?"</p>
<p>The woman shook her head and smiled.</p>
<p>"Then, when the sun rises tomorrow, you will say goodbye to this beautiful world!"</p>
<p>The general sighed, with a regretful expression.</p>
<p>"That's very good!"</p>
<p>The woman laughed again, her eyes shining with bright brilliance.</p>
<p>The general's face turned slightly pale, and his eyes were filled with disappointment and sorrow. He walked in front of the woman, quietly looked at her, and said in a very sympathetic tone...</p>
<p>"Can't I help you at all in the end?"</p>
<p>"You can help a little!"</p>
<p>"Which point?"</p>
<p>"That is, please kill me before dawn!"</p>
<p>"Why!"</p>
<p>"Because I grew up in darkness and must also perish in darkness!"</p>

<h3 id="e223">On Translation · Om <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The matter of translation has been around for a long time! Let's briefly copy the preface to the Collection of Translated Meanings compiled by Master Fayun of Purun Temple in the Shaoxing era, to "speak up" for modern translation experts...</p>
<p>"Those who translate are said to turn the words of Brahma into the words of the Han land. Although the sounds are different, the meanings are largely the same. The Song Monk Biography says... It is like turning brocade embroidery, the front and back are both displayed, but the left and right are different. Translation is said to be exchange, meaning to exchange what one has for what one lacks. Therefore, the scriptures of this land are used to reveal the laws of that land. The Rites of Zhou governs the languages of the four directions, each with its own official. The east is called Ji, the south is called Xiang, the west is called Didi, and all directions are called Yi. Today, the term Yi is commonly used for Western languages, because the Han dynasty was often concerned with the north, and the translation officials also handled Western languages. When Kasyapa Matanga first arrived, he translated the Forty-Two Chapters, and thus it was called translation." Et cetera.</p>
<p>According to "us with the habit of textual research," this origin is actually very early. There are also translation officials in modern times, "speaking as an official," which is quite different from translation, so we don't need to worry about that. Modern translators, when translating Western books, should pay attention to several things, not just "buying a good dictionary." We respectfully present the matters as follows...</p>
<p>1. Deeply understand the Chinese language. Translate it like Chinese, not Japanese or Chinese spoken by foreigners, but Chinese spoken by Chinese people. However, there are several taboos:</p>
<p>a. Avoid flaunting erudition. Don't be verbose and don't deviate from the "main line."</p>
<p>b. Avoid using classical language. Zhang Guan should be Zhang Dai, not Li Dai.</p>
<p>c. Avoid using ancient characters. Writing ancient characters or extracting obscure characters from Han rhapsodies and adding them to the translation in order to seek its high splendor often leads to the point of "not being understood."</p>
<p>d. Avoid pandering. Translating Western poems into regulated verse or the Sao style has the suspicion of pandering, and the result is often that it cannot pander. And it takes too much effort. (To be continued)</p>
<p>"Spring sleep unaware of dawn..."</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>"If I had money," Zhuo Yun finally broke the silence, "I could lend you some privately. But I don't. And I originally thought I could get an advance on a month's salary, but now that's fallen through, so I've become a problem myself. I'm really sorry, please think of a solution elsewhere. Do you have any place you can think of to get help?"</p>
<p>At this point, Ina finally raised her eyes again and began to speak...</p>
<p>"I haven't thought about what to do, and even if I wanted to, it's too late now, so your kindness will easily be wasted. Even regarding you, I initially didn't think of troubling you, and if I had thought of it and known it, this trouble wouldn't have happened. Now, please believe me, now that I know, I won't bother you again."</p>
<p>After saying that, she stood up, ready to leave.</p>
<p>"I have another idea," he said, as if inspired, "but it might not work; sell your novel to some bookstore. Do you know any? Or, I could go ask for you. Whether it succeeds or not, I'll call you."</p>
<p>Although she knew it was hopeless, Ina still hoped that Zhuo Yun could make a phone call to her that contained even a hint of hope. But there was no phone call, no phone call from Zhuo Yun, even the most hopeless one.</p>
<p>"Didn't he say himself that whether it succeeded or not, he would always make a phone call?" she thought miserably. "Alas, he said it himself! What's the use of him saying it himself? Hasn't he already said a lot? Promising again and again, and then again and again not doing what he promised?</p>
<p>The so-called "gate" was already upon her, and the sun of the thirtieth day was already shining on the earth. Ina heard that "gate," saw that "gate," smelled that "gate," and even touched that "gate"—gloomy, sharp, and cold. But at the same time, she also felt joyfully that it was only like that that it felt like celebrating the New Year, that tense, that exciting, something that could never be had when celebrating the Gregorian New Year. If she could get a sum of money on the last day of that year to pay off all her debts, how wonderful that would be! Therefore, she was still preoccupied with that hopeless hope.</p>
<p>"I'll go see Xi Zhuo Yun one more time before deciding," she finally decided. And, even if she didn't go to see Xi Zhuo Yun, she still had to go out, because that way, not only could she avoid her mother's nagging, urging, and reproachful affection, but she could also escape the various expressions on the faces of the approaching debt collectors.</p>
<p>She was led into the guest room, and after a minute or two, the person who came in was not the Xi Zhuo Yun she wanted to see, but his wife.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xi has gone out, Miss Chen. Is there anything you need?" Mrs. Xi asked.</p>
<p>Gone out? For some reason, she didn't quite believe it. She thought he was upstairs.</p>
<p>"There is something," Ina reluctantly said, not wanting to lie, "but I need to talk to him in person; now that he's not here, it's nothing."</p>

<h3 id="e225">Gold Price Plummets Seven Dollars <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Market Sentiment Quite Listless Today —</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market could not sustain itself after the U.S. Senate passed the veterans' bonus bill. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed contraction in London and stability in the U.S. The five metals exchange saw a decline in forward silver prices of 0.5 hao and 0.15 li respectively. Exchange rates rose, London spot gold fell by half a penny, and both U.S. wheat prices saw minor increases and decreases. U.S. cotton fell by 9 pounds. Market sentiment was not satisfied. The opening price of wool immediately fell slightly, hovering around seven dollars, with limited fluctuation. After the opening, market sentiment continued to weaken. Central Bank and Bank of Communications supplied drafts. HSBC's listed exchange rate showed stability in British currency but a sudden rise in the U.S. currency. Foreign dispatches revealed that U.S. Congressman Fessinger requested the Senate to assist the Communist silver proposal. Speculator Mr. Wu divested, and the domestic market trended looser. Many sellers appeared in the market, but the overall situation hovered, with minimal fluctuation. As it lingered, market conditions became even more sluggish at noon. The Associated Press reported that the U.S. Senate passed the veterans' bonus bill, immediately weakening market sentiment, as it was expected that the U.S. government would issue a huge amount of paper money in place of the bonus. The afternoon market was flat, and due to closing-related matters, the market was quiet, struggling around four dollars. Finally, news came that the Seattle night market silver futures rose more than 0.7 li, causing a surge in selling and a decline in prices. Overall, the market sentiment today was quite listless and ordinary. The price of red gold was 977 yuan. A summary of today's market conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 966 yuan and 6 jiao, a decrease of 2 yuan and 4 jiao compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 6 yuan and 9 jiao. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling and 4 pence and 125/10000, and U.S. exchange at 34 yuan and 3125/10000. The Central Bank issued US dollars for June at 6.875. Qianchangxiang, Yuanchun, Dafayong, Yu Dachen, and Chengfuyu Nichangyi Da Yongxie Xingyong sold strips. It was learned that HSBC's listed exchange rate showed stability in British currency but a rise of 125/10000 in U.S. currency, and the price retreated from 6 yuan and 7 jiao to 5 yuan. Although Tianfeng made purchases, Hengtai Xie Xing Qianchangxiang and others continued to sell, and the price further decreased to 4 yuan and 2 jiao. Hengxing Ruikang took advantage of the low price to buy strips. Banks engaged in some offsetting transactions, and the price rose back to 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Mitsui continuously sold US dollars for May at 6.625, and shillings also loosened. Da Dachen and Yi Da Yong sold to 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Yuanchun bought strips, and the price hovered slightly. As it lingered, Fuyu Qianchangxiang and others sold again, causing a retreat to 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Hengtai seized the low price to vigorously purchase. The noon closing was 963 yuan and 5 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 3 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 964 yuan and 2 jiao, and goods opened at 3 yuan and 9 jiao. Qianchangxiang, Hengtai, Yi Da Yong, and others sold goods, causing a fall to 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Macgregor bought US dollars for August at 35 yuan and 625/10000. Macgregor, Mitsui, and Huabi again purchased US dollars for June at 34 yuan and 8125/10000. Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, Yi Da Yong, and others bought strips, raising the price to 4 yuan and 4 jiao. Hongli vigorously sold strips, causing a decline. Da Changxiang also sold, but due to extremely flat trading, Da Fayong bought in, and the decrease was not significant. The situation hovered. As it lingered, unfavorable rumors spread, and night market silver prices soared, causing great fear among the public, and many cut their long positions. Yi Da Yong, Qianchangxiang, and Fuyu took the opportunity to sell again, causing a fall to 1 yuan and 8 jiao. Da Xing Yong bought strips, returning to 2 yuan and 4 jiao. With Huayuan and others supplying, the closing price was 962 yuan, and goods were auctioned at a low of 1 yuan and 2 jiao. After the market closed, Da Dachen, Wanxing, and Fuyu supplied, gradually retreating to 1 yuan and 23 jiao. The highest price of the day was 966 yuan and 7 jiao, and the lowest price was 961 yuan and 8 jiao, a fluctuation of 4 yuan and 9 jiao. As a result, the closing price fell 7 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to HSBC bank's U.S. exchange rate being increased by 125/10000 to 34 yuan and 125/10000, totaled a gold price of 1014 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 52 yuan short, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous closing. HSBC bank's shilling rate remained unchanged at 1 shilling and 4 pence. Using the British-U.S. exchange rate of 4.98605 as the standard, the converted gold price was 722 yuan and 01 fen. This month's strips were settled at this price. The registered prices were 965 yuan for April and 964 yuan for May. The supplementary water in the morning was 722 yuan, and the afternoon price was the same. The red gold price was 977 yuan. Trading in the market was not active. Excluding offsetting transactions, formal transactions were calculated with an additional 13 yuan and 25 fen. 300 liang were sold by the Tianjin gang to Yingfengheng. The Central Bank's acceptance was not smooth. In the morning market, the bid of 965 yuan did not allow the trade to profit, so it did not occur. In the afternoon market, 70 strips were opened. In the morning, 14 strips of March futures were offset by the guest gang for Wanxing to Shuntong, for 722 yuan and 5 jiao, but there was no bid sheet. 126 strips of April futures from Shan Yingfengheng were transferred to Tongfengheng and Da Dachen, priced at 967 yuan. As of today, 1946 strips of April futures remained, with a total of 10 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>
<p>Market trading was uncertain. In summary, Shuntong, Wanxing, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Dekang, Dingkang, Hengchang, Yongyifeng, Yongfutaiheng, Da Dachen, Xiangfeng, etc. were on the buying side. Qianchangxiang, Hongli, Fuyu, Sheng Da, Da Changxiang, Xie Xingyong, Yingfengheng, Yongfengxianghe, and Da Xingyong were on the selling side. Yi Da Yong Sida Da Dachen moved forward and backward. Tongchun Yuanchun Hengtai and Da Fayong moved back and forth. Speculator Mr. Wu also sold. The Dalian gang and Wanxing jointly did over 700 strips, offsetting over 200 strips. Shuntong jointly did about 500 strips, offsetting over 300 strips. The Guangdong gang Shengda bought over 200 strips and sold over 300 strips. Hengxing bought over 400 strips and sold over 200 strips. As of today, the total number of chips for May futures was 18,998 strips, with a total of 43 long positions and 54 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 27,104 strips in the morning market and 9,184 strips in the afternoon market.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Silver Dollar Settlements Increasingly Busy <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, as the end of the month approached, various settlement situations became comparatively busier. However, the market price for silver dollar splitting remained unchanged.

<h3 id="e230">Delivery Volume Sees Another Increase <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>=33,655,000 Yuan=</p>
<p>=Silver and Banking Sectors Still Account for Most Receipts=</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery period for various bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. Market trading was suspended for one day. The total delivery volume was 33,655,000 yuan, of which 23,015,000 yuan was cleared, representing inter-broker deliveries, while the total volume received and cleared at the exchange was 10,640,000 yuan. Off-exchange deliveries were comparatively higher, estimated at around 30 million. The total amount was quite impressive. The delivery volume has gradually increased in recent years, indicating that investment power has gradually developed. However, calculated against the total amount of government bonds, the delivery volume is relatively small, suggesting a shortage of goods and the strong creditworthiness of bonds is evident. Upon investigation, the silver and banking sectors still accounted for most receipts. On the delivery side, in addition to the Ministry of Finance's goods, a portion was also delivered by retail investors. With a stable environment and abundant funds, investment has gradually increased. Tighter lending by the silver and banking sectors has further left short positions with no way out. Market prices have gradually risen, breaking the highest record of 1933 and gradually reaching new highs. Tracing back to the March futures, which started trading on January 30th, after approximately 40 trading days, excluding over ten days of closures for the New Year and various holidays, the market price trended as follows: within the first ten days of trading, there were limited and minimal fluctuations. From February 5th and 6th, as the Lunar New Year approached, new highs were discovered. From the red opening on February 19th, the rising momentum gradually intensified, soaring gradually. The two weeks after the February delivery were the most sluggish, with extremely thin trading and constant hovering. From March 16th, the silver and banking sectors gradually increased absorption, and market prices regained flexibility, mostly rising every day, with the recent one or two weeks seeing an especially strong surge and new highs emerging one after another. The highest price for troop reduction bonds was 74 yuan and 1 jiao, and the highest price for salt tax bonds was 55 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. Compared to the lowest price on February 1st, troop reduction bonds were 7 yuan and 1 jiao higher, and salt tax bonds were 5 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen higher. Even compared to the initial market price, there was a difference of 6-7 yuan, indicating that market prices were almost always rising. During the process, although there were unfavorable news such as the Sun Jun rebellion, the rampant activities of the Communists, the deteriorating relations between Japan and Russia, rumors about the Premier, and the United States raising silver prices, all of them failed to diminish the strong sentiment of the long positions. As the market price had reached a high level, speculators had no opportunities to take advantage of, and instead manipulated the 96 bonds. In recent days, 96 bonds surged to 12 yuan and 8 jiao, matching the highest price of last year, but were merely speculative air and not sustainable, thus soon falling sharply by two yuan and several jiao. From this, it can be seen that speculation and investment have vastly different strengths and cannot be compared. However, with market prices currently high, the future should not see much further upward momentum. Given the strong selling pressure from major players, prices may hover and decline. The total turnover figures for March futures, delivered and cleared over a long period, are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report by Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market was firm amidst sluggishness, with railroad stocks and gold mining stocks showing exceptional performance. The former was due to favorable reports from various lines, including the rescue plans for the Denver and Rio Grande lines. The reasons for the strength of gold and iron stocks were not very clear. According to many opinions, it was a technical upward reaction. The small exchange was also firm due to the rebound of iron stocks. (Bonds) U.S. government bonds were slightly soft, while speculative bonds were mixed and slightly higher. Foreign bonds also made progress. According to the agent's report, (securities) were still in good position, but trading was slow, awaiting new developments. (Wheat) Market sentiment was too pessimistic. Trading clustered in May. There were strong winds and dust in the Southwest, and the climate was very cold. From a sentimental point of view, prices will be slightly higher. Harvest conditions in Ottawa have improved. Oklahoma and Texas are good. Kansas and New Mexico lack rain. Missouri has declined. (Cotton) Opposition to the Punk-Hay case in the Senate is growing stronger. If the current amendment passes, including allowing each farmer to be tax-exempt for six bales per year, reducing penalties, and exempting unpackaged goods, trust is difficult to obtain. The news is not very favorable, but some still believe that currency will be inflated. According to rumors, cloth factories will reduce work by 10% within eight weeks. There is no need for spot goods, and gauze remains quiet. Total daily turnover was 840,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>=Talk of Production Cuts at Japanese Mills Is Rampant=</p>
<p>=Active Spot Sales Trigger Short Covering=</p>
<p>The yarn market initially declined and then rose, showing slightly more stability. Due to a slight increase in actual demand, Yunnan gangs bought 700 bales of coarse yarn, and Guangdong gangs also had transactions of 2-300 bales, causing market sentiment to strengthen. Shorts covered their profits. At the same time, talk of production cuts at Japanese mills was rampant, thus suppressing selling pressure. Prices rebounded by several jiao in the afternoon, and the overall situation was relatively calm.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Marked Yarn Rebounds 3 Jiao in Afternoon <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market saw prices decline across all months by 2.3 jiao due to continued declines in U.S. cotton and dispersed market sentiment. In the afternoon, those who profited covered their positions, and prices rose by 5-6 jiao across all months. Total turnover for the day was 20,650 bales. It was found that Yuande sold 1,150 bales, Yuanda 950 bales, Jinchang 1,100 bales, Chong'an 1,200 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Da Changcheng 700 bales, and Mingde 650 bales.

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but rallied in the afternoon, but U.S. cotton continued to decline, discovering new lows, thus weakening market sentiment and causing longs to close positions. The market declined. However, some who profited covered their short positions, and prices rallied in the afternoon. However, the motion to cut production at Japanese mills is becoming more and more reasonable, so sales of spot cotton on the market are unusually sluggish. Those holding goods are heavily selling in near-term contracts. The future still depends on foreign cotton for its progress.</p>

<p>The opening of the marked cotton market saw prices decline by one jiao across all months due to further declines in U.S. cotton and closure of positions by the longs. In the afternoon, shorts covered, and prices rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half across all months. Total turnover for the day was 83,700 dan.

<p>Consumption of spot cotton is quite dull. The appetite of various mills is very sluggish, and the trend of closures is becoming more and more pronounced. There is no source. The selling prices of spot cotton are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market lacked significant buyers, and prices fell due to long positions being liquidated. Prices rebounded later with buying from dealers. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points per pound, and futures prices fell by 9 to 13 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long positions being liquidated and futures traders selling, but prices rebounded with short covering. As a result, Pingar fell by 1.5 rupees, and Oomra and White Broach each fell by 2 rupees. Original telegram from [location omitted], (dated the 28th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months showed a flat and weak trend. Chicago wheat prices fluctuated by 8 to 10 cents, and Canadian wheat was up about 4 cents. However, after the opening prices were announced, market sentiment remained weak. Although scattered transactions were seen with active retail sales, large-scale shipments were quiet. It was heard that Tianjin spot sales accounted for half, while Shanghai flour only reached over 10,000 [units], which is rare. This is the reason for the poor market sentiment. By the afternoon opening, market prices for all months were also weak. Because the delivery month is approaching, many outside long positions have exited, leading to another decline of one dime. The distant months also showed fatigue. Given the current situation, if retail sales are not smooth, although a large drop is unlikely, a rise will also be difficult. As a result, this month's price fell by 1.5 cents, April fell by 1.25 cents, May fell by 1.5 cents, June fell by 1.75 cents, July fell by 1 cent, and August fell by 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Dense Sell Orders in Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months showed a consistent weak trend. This month has already passed, and there were no transactions in April or May. However, sentiment for distant new wheat has softened. Although the cold and rainy spring in various places inevitably affects the wheat seedlings, it is not a significant concern in terms of the season. Moreover, given the low demand in the new wheat season after the government wheat is completely sold out, and the sluggish flour sales, sell orders surged in both the morning and afternoon sessions, and prices fell sharply. As a result, June fell by 6 cents, July fell by 4 cents, and August fell by 5 cents. Due to mutual rejection between factories and customers, there were no spot wheat transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e241">North and South Rice Markets Decline One After Another <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>▲Shanghai South Yesterday, more than forty [rice] dealers arrived (more than 6,000 piculs). Although the weather cleared, sales in various markets were weaker than expected. Due to continuous spring rains, dealers had accumulated a lot of stock, and their intentions to buy were somewhat dampened. Sellers with larger quantities of goods were eager to sell quickly, so the market appeared active, but in reality, it had turned weak. Also, as the end of the month approached, urban and rural shops temporarily suspended purchases. Prices for Changbang, Sutong, Nangang and other japonica rice were difficult to stabilize. Higher-priced rice weakened by about 5 cents, while mid-range rice fell by nearly a dime. Duyang and Jian rice were also affected, falling by about a dime. High-quality Yin rice was able to hold its ground, while mid-quality and lower-quality rice declined. Sales of late-season rice were weak, and contracted sales continued to fluctuate. Only dealers from Beiyang, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei took deliveries, providing support to the market. As a result, the decline was uneven, ranging from 3-5 cents, 6-7 cents, to nearly a dime.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai North Yesterday, goods from various river dealers arrived. Inland waterways were open, and about ten dealers arrived, but sales remained sluggish. High-quality white japonica rice was stable, while mid-quality and lower-quality rice was slightly lower by a few cents. Yangdu and Jian Baiyuan rice were down slightly by 3-5 cents, and thin rice was down by nearly a dime. Merchants' Jian early rice and Yin Yuan rice were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Accumulated Foreign Rice Being Sold <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>▲Small Package of 85,000 Bags...6.50 Yuan</p>
<p>▲Merchants from Zhejiang and Fujian Continue to Handle...Market Turning Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, merchants from Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, continued to handle shipments. Merchants from Fuzhou, Fujian province, had not handled shipments for many days, but resumed handling shipments yesterday due to the favorable market prices. As a result, the market atmosphere became more active, and sentiment was hopeful. Although there were continued arrivals, the market is gradually becoming more active, so the market should stabilize temporarily. Yesterday, Fuzhou handled 400 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice at a price of 6.90 yuan, and 122 bags of rough red rice at a price of 5.90 yuan. This price is about one dime lower than the prices quoted earlier. If the price is favorable, it may stimulate merchant activity. Wenzhou handled 1,200 bags of Nanjing Chenxian and factory Xian rice, and 288 bags of Chuzhou machine-milled Xian rice. The price was similar to the previous market, and the situation was slightly better.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been quiet for a long time, and there have been no large transactions in recent months. Most of the scattered transactions on the market are goods being recovered from the local market, affected by merchant Xian rice, and prices have been unable to improve for a long time. Merchants also lack sales channels, so the inventory on the market is close to 200,000 [bags]. Yesterday, Dachen and Xinfeng rice firms negotiated with Anli Foreign Firm to sell 85,000 bags of small package rice. Because it was a bulk transaction, the price was only 6.50 yuan, which is cheaper than the market price. It is said that some of this batch of foreign rice has already been allocated by dealers.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Soybean Market Weak <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of soybeans was still continuous, and factories were still the biggest buyers. Other channels such as local exports had some interest, but it was difficult to expect large-scale purchases, so sentiment was weak and prices fell by 1-2 cents. Yesterday, 600 bags of Dangshan soybeans, two truckloads of Nanhe heavy soybeans, and three truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans were sold, all handled by factories. One truckload of Huaiyuan soybeans and one truckload of Feihe soybeans were purchased by local merchants. In addition, 300 bags of Guide soybeans and 300 bags of Feihe soybeans were for export.</p>

<p>▲New York Raw Silk Market Active but No Sales New York silk mills, in view of the global economic downturn, the sales of silk fabrics are declining, and they are reducing production and shutting down machines to clear accumulated inventory. The consumption of raw silk has decreased significantly. Furthermore, Japanese silk is being dumped at excessively low prices, so no one is interested in Chinese silk. According to news from the American silk merchant Qianli Foreign Firm in Shanghai, in the second half of this month, the New York raw silk market for Chinese silk is almost active but without sales. Only stockpilers sold 8,000 pounds of Grade B white filature silk at an average of 81.2 points, and the selling price was only about US$1.40 per pound, equivalent to just over 480 yuan per bale converted to Chinese currency.</p>
<p>▲Old Cocoons from Hangzhou Actively Transported to Shanghai The spring silkworm season in Hangzhou and Shaoxing is starting, and new cocoons are quickly entering the market. Merchants with leftover old cocoons are actively transporting them to Shanghai. Yesterday, 108 loads of double cocoons were transported to Shanghai from stations such as Gengshanmen and Changan to seek sales.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai Silk Sales Increasingly Sluggish Overseas raw silk prices are becoming increasingly weak, the demand from various silk mills is increasingly rare, and Japanese silk is being dumped at excessively low prices, with supply exceeding demand. No one is paying attention to Chinese silk. European and American firms in Shanghai are all taking a wait-and-see approach. Mainland silk factories are buying as needed, sales are sparse, and the selling price is extremely low. Silk merchants are suffering significant losses and cannot afford to sell. The market atmosphere is becoming increasingly sluggish, and the future of silk sales is in a desperate situation.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Sharp Increase in Tunxi Tea Firms <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The tea industry in Tunxi has always been prosperous. Since the opening of the Hangzhou [to Tunxi] highway, tea merchants have become even more excited. The British firm Baochang Foreign Firm, which handles tea in Shanghai, has established a large-scale tea factory in that city. More than twenty other newly established firms have been set up, bringing the total to more than seventy, and the situation is quite active.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Sugar Market, Chaoqing Sugar Prices in Producing Areas Rise <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, the guild set prices at 19.85 yuan for Grade 24 granulated white sugar, with over 200 bags traded. Grade 9 brown sugar was priced at 20.025 yuan, and Zhenji Factory's Grade 1 local white sugar was priced at 18.55 yuan. A telegram from Chaoqing producing areas today reported that prices have risen by two dimes due to scarce supply. Shanghai, as a sales destination, has not seen strong demand, so it is difficult to improve. Current market prices for high-grade sugar are still 11.95 yuan or 11.85 yuan. Ordinary goods are 11.67 yuan, and Lingjiao Xing sugar is also being sold. Zhuqing has opened up over 100 bags, priced at 10.06 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Metals, 5,000+ Boxes of New American Tinplate Arrive <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to sluggish sales, the metal trade has been very quiet. Although industry players are making every effort to promote sales to factories and construction clients, there has been no progress due to the unfavorable environment. As a result, market standards have gradually declined, but tinplate is able to hold its ground due to strong sentiment. 90-pound American single-thickness is estimated at 15.25 yuan, 100-pound at 16.50 yuan, 90-pound American double-thickness is estimated at 30.05 yuan, and 100-pound at 33.25 yuan. 90-pound English single-thickness sells for 14.90 yuan, 100-pound for 16 yuan, 90-pound double-thickness sells for 30 yuan, and 100-pound for 31.50 yuan. Huisi iron, 200-pound old steel factory iron, sells for 28 yuan, and new steel factory iron is 27 yuan. Trade is still good.</p>

<h3 id="e267">More Liberal Arts than Sciences <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>According to reports, the Ministry of Education's recent statistics on national students studying abroad in the 21st year show a total of 576 people, with 213 studying sciences and 342 studying liberal arts, including 179 specializing in law and political science. (21 people are not specified.) Upon careful examination of this statistical table, those studying liberal arts account for more than three-fifths of the total, while those specializing in law and political science account for about one-third of the total.</p>
<p>At a time when the call for "reviving the nation and building the country" is rampant, there should be a great reliance on specialized and capable technical personnel. It seems that the number of Chinese students studying science and engineering should be on a sharp and rapid rise. However, according to this disclosure, things are upside down, which makes people feel deeply doubtful about this "revival and construction." Originally, China's dispatch of students to study abroad has lacked planning, which is truly a loss of the intention to "reserve talents for the country." At the same time, these students, praised as "foreign scholars" and boasting that they will contribute to the country and the nation, mostly do not belong to the young masters and sons of high-ranking officials, but are extravagant and luxurious children. Their travels to Europe, the East, and the New World are mostly for enjoyment, and they never seek trouble by burying themselves in studies. Choosing liberal arts is easier and more enjoyable for them, which is not surprising. However, in light of the current situation in China, this is not just a simple matter, but symbolizes the following two meanings:</p>
<p>First, the dark clouds of the global economic recession have enveloped the entire land of China. In the areas affected, rural bankruptcy, commercial depression, and industrial closures are inevitable. Coupled with years of war and endless internal strife, this vast and resource-rich country is left gasping for breath. Adding to this the unprecedented natural disaster of "three years without rain," all the beautiful plans for revival and construction have become "desirable but unattainable." Therefore, many scientific talents who "return home after completing their studies" feel lost and have no place to use their skills. Learning from the past, many people who cannot find a way out "in the vertical lines of triangles" change their course and turn to study the "great way of governing the world" in law and political science. The fact that there are more students studying liberal arts than sciences is a reflection of this social turmoil.</p>
<p>Second, who doesn't want wealth and luxury? In the past, the imperial examinations allowed many people, especially scholars, to enter the officialdom through beautiful essays. But now times have changed, and it is said that it is difficult to govern without understanding even a little bit of politics, legal principles, or interpretive jargon. Driven by this desire, many people indeed see studying law and political science as a shortcut to joining the ranks of officials in the central ministries. The particularly large number of students studying law and political science is also likely induced by this kind of opportunistic mentality.</p>
<p>In the past, during the slogan of "education is sacred," some scientific talents who studied abroad could follow the example of "circular education" and reluctantly take up teaching positions in schools when they could not "apply" what they had "learned." But now, not only is this considered a bland life, but also because it is no longer sacred, it is not easy to seek a teaching position, which is also one of the reasons contributing to more liberal arts than sciences. My wooden clogs friends often scold us for being a non-modernized country with disunified politics, but now we have one-third of the students studying abroad in various countries specializing in law and political science. How do we know that politics will not get on track and the whole country will be unified in the future? Why not respond in this way?</p>
<h3 id="e268">One of the Diary of a Soldier <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>The sun just disappeared! Only a few almond-yellow clouds were floating in the sky. The train stopped at the station for the first time.</p>
<p>Jumping out of the freight car, two groups of people occupied the platform. In the gray crowd, only a few yellowish-brown tarpaulin hats could be seen. I wanted to know the name of the station; however, before I could do so, we gathered and followed the team out of the station.</p>
<p>It's getting late! We only had steamed buns once on the train, and we haven't had dinner yet. I don't know how much further we have to walk, and I don't know where we'll camp. It wasn't until after walking for four or five hours that we reached a village. Although there was some moonlight on the road, I kept stubbing my toes on the uneven hillsides.</p>
<p>We found a house of local people to stay in. Today is considered a good thing for being the vanguard, as we found a house first. Otherwise, if we arrive late, we might have to camp outdoors.</p>
<p>The cooks quickly cooked the meal for us to eat. The commander ordered, "No roll call tonight!" Everyone was very happy and wanted to rest early. The squad leaders were taking care of the sleeping arrangements! Some were already snoring like cows; I was also about to enter dreamland.</p>
<p>In an instant, a flash of light flashed across my face. Someone was talking to the guard at the door. Then, he walked in, shone a flashlight into the company commander's room. In a small voice, he was looking for the clerk sergeant. Tonight at two o'clock, a general attack. Our XX regiment is attacking San Chen Zhuang. I felt in my heart that I couldn't sleep anymore! At the same time, the company commander had already called the messengers! Just as I was thinking about getting up, the officer of the day blew the whistle, and the duty squad leader also blew the whistle. Then, there was a sound of rolling gray blankets, coughing, and bayonets falling to the ground... instantly breaking through the silent air.</p>
<p>It just so happened that three coolies ran away last night. All day today, the ordnance bullets in the company headquarters were carried in shifts by the first and second platoons. Now, we have to rely on the third and fourth platoons.</p>
<p>The company commander issued a temporary order: The third and fourth platoons are to find eight coolies. The squad leader told Liu Jinbiao and me to find four, "If you can't find them, you two will have to carry them!"</p>
<p>I'm most afraid of these things. It's easy for me to shoot two people, but it's really hard to find a few living people to suffer!</p>
<p>However, what can I do? If I don't get them, I'll have to carry them myself; but I can only carry so much alone. As I walked, that's what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Walking past a few houses, we only encountered some old women. Those with money and people had certainly escaped long ago. "I know; we don't need to go into houses that don't have a gate or houses that have no one."</p>
<p>That's what I told Liu Jinbiao. "Good! There's a gate here!" He kicked it twice and then smashed it open with the butt of his gun... I followed him inside.</p>
<p>Facing the gate was a hall without a door. He looked inside and walked in; I stood and looked around. That's good; there was a sound of a man asking questions inside. I continued to go in; an old man of about fifty, wearing his clothes, opened the door; two boys of seventeen or eighteen years old came out of the room next door. Wang Jinbiao spoke to him politely in Henan dialect; they didn't dare to object, nor did they say they wouldn't go. They stood there uncertainly, trying to make up their minds.</p>
<p>After speaking for a long time, they were still noncommittal. He got angry and gave them two gun butts. I also kicked the old man twice...</p>
<p>"We're here to fight for you; you're not even willing to carry things for us?" I said.</p>
<p>They obeyed very obediently; but I felt very remorseful in my heart. I remembered the inhuman and barbaric actions of the soldiers in our hometown during the warlord era. At that time, even though we were children, we felt so indignant and cursed them! Now, because of the pressure of the environment, this kind of unreasonable and barbaric behavior has openly been realized by myself! The reason is caused by the environment.</p>

<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>丨Remember Huaibei丨</p>
<p>I have left Huaibei, and hastily returned to the South, without realizing that it has become a memory of more than half a year ago. When I embarked on my return journey to the South, I originally thought that we would meet again after only ten days or so of separation. Who could have imagined that this would seem to be an indefinite farewell? The traces I left in Huaibei are like fallen flowers drifting on the flowing water, traceless and no longer remembered by people; while the impressions that Huaibei gave me still appear in my mind from time to time, and have never been blurred. Huaibei is indeed lovely, making me</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>reluctant to leave. In a heaven without the embellishments of the times丨What use is it to embellish heaven?丨, what is manifested everywhere is quiet harmony, the most supreme! The people there, the customs there, even every hill and every stream, every blade of grass and every tree, I regard them with utmost reverence, viewing them as sacred, and I cannot help but feel that everything is specially designed for heaven, or rather, I should say, unique to heaven!</p>
<p>The impression Huaibei gave me is really too deep! But... this is definitely not a bad thing. Who wouldn't want to have a deep impression of what he loves? And who wouldn't want to admire in his dreams the lover he longs to see but cannot see? 丨This is all very good, so why should I worry so much about my stubborn views? The only thing I feel is happiness, that in every moment when I recall Huaibei, all the things surrounding me gradually disappear, until it seems as if there is nothing left, only me alone.</p>
<p>I should always remember clearly that in the spring of the year before last, when I first entered a town in Huaibei, it was precisely when she (Huaibei) was being ravaged by bandits. At that time, the residents there were fleeing in droves, supporting the old and carrying the young, while I was carrying my luggage, embarking on my journey to meet her for the first time.</p>
<p>I have already said that what I first arrived at was a town in Huaibei, a small town. 丨Although, this small town later introduced me to everything in Huaibei丨At that time, everything in this town seemed very peaceful (later I learned that it was indeed peaceful, and had always been peaceful), after the footsteps of the bandits had passed. How fortunate am I? My body and mind are entrusted to a heaven that is unparalleled in its peace! But how am I to describe this heaven? I am incapable; even if I try my best, I will inevitably fall into the mundane. Then, shall I let it forever appear in my mind? That is even more impossible, as it would make me feel uneasy. Alas! Too deep an impression instead makes me hesitate and not know what to do! 丨Stop hesitating! Write down those scattered fragments first, anyway, they are all given to me by heaven.</p>
<p>Among the earliest things in this small town to develop a close relationship with me was the earthen wall丨a city wall built entirely of earth.</p>
<p>When I first arrived there, I didn't know many people, and I often walked alone on the wall in the morning, strolling for dozens of spans, or even staying for half a day. The ground above was covered with velvety grass, facing the sunlight, all flourishing. In the middle of them, a small path that seemed hidden and only enough for one person to walk on was left out, and I roamed on it. Sometimes I looked up at the sky, and in the green sky, white clouds flew lazily over my head; sometimes I looked down at my feet... to see if any grass had been trampled by me, and the little butterflies flying among them all circled around me, as if surprised by this stranger who did not often come here. I also cast my long gaze into the distance, and saw an endless green wheat field, undulating with the wind, rolling towards me like the waves of the sea. Ah! A gust of wind blew open my heart. I walked forward, and after a few dozen steps, a row of willow trees came into view... some of the tree trunks were already very thick, and some were still slender. The hanging willow leaves made me think that comparing them to the waists of beauties was so disgusting. Ah! You criminals who specialize in stealing from nature! You have defiled nature! 丨I am extremely happy! I really doubt that this is not the human world. 丨Why doubt it? This is originally heaven!</p>
<p>I love willow trees the most, so I love to go even more to the place where willow trees are planted next to the earthen wall. I remember that one afternoon in summer, I met Fen near there, because there was a very large and deep pond right next to the wall, and she was driving a flock of ducks there to forage. The ducks were walking in front, waddling, and she was raising her hands behind them, following them while making a "shush shush" sound in her mouth. Heavens! I really don't know how to describe the scene at that time! It was really too wonderful!</p>
<p>She ran onto the wall, precisely where the willow trees were planted. 丨I should thank heaven that she, like me, also loves willow trees. She sat down under the shade of a willow tree, and I also went up and down, hearing good words丨How can I repeat it all? Rigid words can no longer express even a fraction of the vividness of the spirit at that time. She said that willow trees best suited her, that she liked the scenery of this temple the most, and that every time she came here to let the ducks out, she always had to come up and sit for a while. She had so much to say! Every time she switched from one sentence to another, she would always change to the most appropriate and natural expression. She said... "I have asked myself several times, 'Why does my heart feel so at peace every time I step onto this wall?'"</p>
<p>Everything about that earthen wall is now floating in front of my eyes again. Don't be angry, heaven, Miss Fen! The leaves of the willow trees should be hanging again!</p>
<h3 id="e271">Is Marriage the Tomb of Love? (Part 2) <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Jie</p>
<p>Moreover, we also know that marriage is only a form. It only came into being after a certain kind of social system developed. Its essence is still the inevitable and reasonable demand between men and women. Its essence does not change because of the form of marriage. It's just that some colors have been embellished on the form. In primitive human society, when there was no surplus labor, everyone sought their own living materials by their own labor. The union between men and women was purely a reasonable union. There was no such chaotic and painful tragedy after marriage as in modern society. These are obvious facts.</p>
<p>Moreover, is the marriage life in modern society completely so miserable? It is not always the case. There are also relatively happy marriages. Moreover, there are some facts! After marriage, they love each other more than when they were in love. This is undoubtedly a part of the truth, and no one can deny it. So the problem is that marriage is certainly not the tomb of love, but a bad social structure gives marriage pain. However, we cannot therefore deny that marriage itself is reasonable, and negatively say that marriage is the tomb of love. At the same time, we are not like Ms. Ruizhu, saying that a sincere heart and unconditional love can solve the bad problems after marriage in modern society. Because the reason for the unreasonable result is not in the shift of each individual's subjective consciousness, it can be helpful, but it is; the factor is hidden in the bottom of the basic structure of society. Therefore, no matter how kind you are to shout that we should not use money and honor as the standard for combination, but in fact, as long as capitalist society exists for one day, and a new rational society does not appear for one day, there will always be many standards for combination based on money and honor. Moreover, it will further promote its poisonous tongue with the struggle of the dying capitalism of the dying years, so I said above that Ms. Ruizhu only sees the surface of the phenomenon, but fails to find the root of the problem, and only has a piece of kind advice.</p>
<p>Therefore, our conclusion is... finding the root cause of this problem is to solve it by reforming the basic structure of society. If the social system can be moved to a reasonable foundation, then marriage and love will not be contradictory, but will become generally reasonable, and further develop its reasonable self. Getting married not only does not make the passionate love of the past disappear, but also opens up more happy flowers and fruits. Returning to the original state of love and marriage that is without contradictions and without sin.</p>

<h3 id="e273">Not Lending to Chinese People <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Lvyun</p>
<p>It is not easy to live in Shanghai, and everyone knows that the rent reduction movement is not effective. A small clerk with a monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan probably has to spend one-half or one-third of his total income on rent. In this way, renting a small house (a small area house) is the most difficult; is it the easiest thing for wealthy families who want to rent a large Western-style house? The day before yesterday, my friend and I went to the western district of Shanghai to look for houses along the street. Although there were very good buildings, they were either poorly lit or simply unsuitable for residential use. Finally, at the western end of Maiersi Avenue, we found a Tolet Western-style house. When we walked up to it, a foreman-like person shook his head and said that this place is not lent to Chinese people! He looked like a clown in a movie, with an unwilling look on his face. He also spoke the three words "Chinese people" with special effort; however, he himself, like us, is a Chinese of the Yellow race!</p>
<p>Foreigners built houses on our Chinese land, and they put on a stern face and said that they would not lend them to Chinese people. The reason, of course, is that Chinese people are a barbaric nation. As long as Chinese people arrive at any public place, they will make a mess of it. The previous sign at the park gate "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed" is also for this reason. Thinking about it, we Chinese are really hopeless. Now we are still being looked down upon in our own country. It is natural that there is a possibility of being forced to return home when studying abroad. What's there to say? There are also those like the foreman who help the evildoers.</p>

<p>(Note)</p>
<p>"Grandpa Bei said that this year is a year of disaster, famine, plague, alas! May the Bodhisattva bless us!" Old Grandma Jixiang muttered like chanting a mantra, covering her red, rotten, and blurry eyes with her sleeves.</p>
<p>"To hell with him, if it were me, I would have lost it long ago. Is it worth making such a fuss!"</p>
<p>"A Gen! May I ask how big your backer is? Lose it, your mother's old butt is not even smelly enough to stick candles in! You little devil."</p>
<p>Uncle Jia laughed wildly to himself, and the adults also laughed, and the children also laughed. The sound of laughter rippled in the space. A Xiang's face showed embarrassment and discomfort. He wanted to argue with Uncle Jia, but finally he held back. The children took the opportunity to squeeze into the middle, opened their eyes, sniffed their noses, and curiously looked at the faces of the adults.</p>
<p>"Where's Uncle Shunxing?"</p>
<p>"A Gua's father went to Mr. Yunfu to ask for help from Feng Bo." Shunxing's wife was both anxious and resentful. A Xing realized at this time that Uncle Shunxing was really not around.</p>
<p>"Asking the iron calculator for help, the ending is predictable..." Old Grandma Jixiang secretly pulled on Old Grandpa Jixiang's clothes, and Old Grandpa Jixiang's words were interrupted. Old Grandma Jixiang looked at everyone in a panic.</p>
<p>"Shunxing was too stubborn last year. He didn't sell the field to him, but now he asks him for help. He deserves this suffering, but if he doesn't ask him for help, there's no way." Someone in the crowd said this. Really, Mr. Yunfu was angry about this last year, and everyone knew it, and they were worried about Uncle Shunxing!</p>
<p>"Here he comes, here he comes;..."</p>
<p>The owner came, and the onlookers seemed to feel relieved, and their curiosity rose again. Everyone automatically dispersed. In addition to Uncle Shunxing and Feng Bo, he also brought a polite, smoothly haired, wearing a white gauze shirt and black trousers, and walking a bit like gentlemen, slowly swaying his figure-eight gait, and raising and lowering his shoulders, a small white face, and some people could recognize him, this was Mr. Yunfu's trusted servant. Shunxing's wife no longer had her eyebrows furrowed. Although Shunxing's resentful silence made her know that he had been wronged, she was relieved that Mr. Yunfu was willing to send someone. Because of the seriousness of the owner, they stood silently without any movement. The air suddenly became tense, and many eyes were focused on these three important characters who had just arrived.</p>
<p>"Brother Liu! You've worked hard." Feng Bo bowed humbly, and Shunxing also accompanied him, smiling bitterly. The guy who was called Brother Liu had an attitude as solemn as a priest in a church. He tucked those treasures under his armpits, and walked with arrogance. Feng Bo kept bowing and nodding, always seeing him off.</p>
<p>"May the gods and Buddhas bless us!" Shunxing's wife exhaled, a stone fell to the ground; the onlookers also exhaled in relief.</p>
<p>"Ten silver dollars in one hug, damn it!" Uncle Shunxing cursed angrily, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Ten white dragons?" Shunxing's wife's small eyes were widened by this number, and the tears she had been holding back rolled down, and her face turned white.</p>
<p>"Money breaks through to bring peace! Money breaks through to bring peace!" Feng Bo waved his right hand, consoling miserably.</p>
<p>"Heavens, aren't twenty loads of sweet potatoes afraid of not selling for ten silver dollars!"</p>
<p>"Shunxing is too stupid, giving him two farts!"</p>
<p>"Hum! He wanted twenty yuan, but Brother Feng bitterly begged, damn it, that situation really made people angry to death!" Uncle Shunxing gritted his teeth and hated, Feng Bo smiled miserably.</p>

<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>= MGM Accused of Allusion =</p>
<p>= Former Russian Grand Duchess Seeks Compensation for Losses =</p>
<p>Prince Yussupov decided to personally investigate whether Rasputin's harm was true, so he pretended to submit to him and found out that he was licentious and ambitious to usurp the throne. Rasputin drank wildly all day long, thinking that Prince Yussupov was also under his control, so he told him all his treacherous plans, and even revealed his relationship with the Empress. He boasted that the Empress could not lose him, because he could save the Crown Prince today and kill him tomorrow. He also said that he was determined to be the master of all Russia. He also told Prince Yussupov in person the secret that he had been used by Germany. His planned conspiracy was to have the Tsar abdicate and the Empress act as regent, so that he would be no different from the Emperor of Russia.</p>
<p>Prince Yussupov then secretly discussed this matter with courtiers who were loyal to the country. At that time, the Tsar was personally leading the front line, and the police were unable to do anything. They decided to get rid of this powerful traitor, so Prince Yussupov took action himself. Rasputin once boasted that he knew that someone wanted to assassinate him, but no one could hurt a hair on his head. Prince Yao then obtained poison from a doctor that was enough to poison twenty people, and mixed it into wine and cheese. Rasputin ate all the wine and cheese, but there was no movement at all. Prince Yao panicked, so he took out a pistol and shot. Rasputin fell to the ground after being shot, as if he was dead. Soon he came alive again, so Prince Yao fired another shot and threw him into the river. Afterwards, he was arrested and exiled abroad, and his wife followed him. When he was exiled abroad, he could be said to be penniless. Now that they have watched this film, they cannot help but feel emotional and reminisce about the past.</p>
<p>The story of Princess Natasha and Prince Shigodiev's engagement in the film is their story at that time. The various aspects of Rasputin before and after were filmed vividly. The portrayal of Princess Natasha in the film also having a relationship with Rasputin, and Rasputin going to Princess Natasha's place, the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that it actually contained a hint that the princess was Rasputin's lover.</p>
<p>When the princess appeared in court, she was wearing a primary color coat, and her hat was also black. A net covered her eyes, and a bunch of fresh flowers were inserted in her mink collar, which made her even more beautiful. She said that she lived with her mother. When the defendant's lawyer asked, she said that she was the second niece of the late Empress, and she often went to the palace. When the war broke out, she was in Germany, and later managed to escape back to Russia. She had never met Rasputin, but she often heard people talk about him. After the communist revolution, she accompanied the Empress Dowager from Crimea on a British warship to escape. She watched the film and believed that Princess Natasha was alluding to her, and Shigodiev was alluding to her husband. Prince Yao also said the same, and pointed out that the palace scene, depicting Natasha's plight, actually contained the meaning that after she had an affair with Rasputin, Rasputin told her not to make a sound. The princess finally stated to the court that she was prepared to file the same lawsuit in Austria, Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other countries. (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e276">Review of "Confessions of a Girl" <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>ParoleGirl 丨 Cathay 丨</p>
<p>American films almost have a common trend. No matter what, they must be light and fast, so that the entertaining audience can be carefree in the time of one hundred and twenty minutes. Therefore, no matter what the subject matter is, even if it is quite real, it must be made as interesting as possible. As for the story that is empty and similar because of the interest, that is naturally even more needless to say.</p>
<p>This is by no means an accidental phenomenon. There are many audiences in the United States who demand a Happyending, and slapstick comedy can sell well. Why shouldn't the producers try their best to meet their demands?</p>
<p>"Confessions of a Girl" also belongs to this type of film.</p>
<p>Regardless of the playwright's explanation that Shelby's scam was for her father's illness, and regardless of the fact that he could not ignore the morbidity of society, this was only to intersperse a rather interesting story for the poor girl.</p>
<p>Regarding the story itself, although it unfolds a certain part of the social phenomenon, perhaps those who are responsible for maintaining law and order will consider it to be an incitement to theft. Isn't it? It teaches you how to scam, and it teaches you how to cheat in prison. However, this film is being publicly screened, so there is nothing to say, perhaps because it is a boring narrative and is not noticed by people.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is an insignificant film. Ordinary, vulgar, even if you have seen it, you will forget it when you walk out of the theater. Obviously, this is because the content is empty. This proves that a work of art must have substantial content, otherwise it will never be able to move people.</p>
<p>Regarding this film, I really don't think there is anything to say. Regardless of whether it is a clear and smooth narrative of a story, and the so-called expression techniques are still very skilled, but in the technically advanced United States, what is so strange about it?</p>
<p>Meek拉克, who plays Xue Erwei, can be considered to have performed well. Perhaps she is the pillar of Columbia? 拉夫伯勒孟, who plays Smith, is worthless, and he is not even qualified to be called competent.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Review of "Pardners" <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Si</p>
<p>Pardners 丨 Da Guangming 丨</p>
<p>On the screen, just like on the stage, good actors with talent can certainly make the content of the script have a higher and more effective expression, and even complete an effect that is beyond the author's imagination; but if the content of the script is too empty, this will bind the genius of good actors, making them unable to have sufficient development opportunities, and as a result, their performance in it will become ordinary, lifeless, and without any creative meaning. Even if there is a top-notch director to direct, at most, he can only make some small effects on many small techniques, as for the main overall effect (including the actors' creation), it still cannot be saved. If the script is not good, the actors and directors are useless.</p>
<p>"Pardners" is a very obvious example. It is just a collection of some accidental and meaningless events. There is no certain center. The author seems to want to describe Sikete 丨 played by Jia Kegu Bo 丨 as the center, but the compilation of the script did not fully grasp the center, and the director's technique did not make efforts to remedy such shortcomings. As a result, the impression that "Pardners" gives people is that there is no certain center and no unified effect.</p>
<p>Also, this film did not first express the family situation of Sikete 丨 that is, his father's difficulties and his loneliness 丨 very concretely. This is really a loss for describing Sikete's experience as the center, because if the author concretely expresses it with sympathy, it can strengthen the effect of Sikete in the development of the whole play. In this way, the expression of the center will be strengthened and made more prominent and powerful. But the author and the director do not do this.</p>
<p>In addition, if the interlude of bullfighting, especially that Du Bai saw his runaway wife and her lover in the bullfighting arena, is really too accidental. This is not of much benefit to the development of the whole play and the expression of the center, but just increases the length of the film. In fact, such empty works can only be completed by using such accidental interludes... This is how most European and American film authors make films at present.</p>
<p>Several important actors in "Pardners" are very competent; it is just a pity that they are limited by the content of the script and the lack of creative talent of the director, and because the techniques are not clever, they do not have brilliant and moving performances; especially Jia Kegu Bo, in this film, his performance talent is even more restricted.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Taihua Film Company to be Established <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>The "Baiou" Film Company, which was previously being planned in this port, has now been renamed "Taihua." The company was founded by playwright Zuo Ming and Bao Zhichao. Last month, Zuo and Bao went to Beijing specifically to raise funds, and moved the preparation office to the capital. Now, with the enthusiastic investment from all walks of life in the capital, more than 30,000 yuan has been raised. It is said that the capital is currently tentatively set at 100,000 yuan. When 50,000 yuan is raised, the film will be officially shot. At present, Zuo and others are in Beijing, collecting funds on the one hand, and carrying out company registration and other procedures on the other hand. It is expected that they will be able to return to Shanghai in about a week.</p>

From this short "special express" moment, it will expose the sorrowful climax of the unemployed masses, the powerless shouts, the opening of the bright future, and the struggle in the dark pit one by one, and indicate them one by one. Now, the whole play has been mostly completed.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Mrs. Connally's stern voice startled Joanna out of her sweet dreams. Mrs. Connally, calling Will, walked up. She said, "Will, isn't this the time you danced with Fotini? She's looking for you." Will and Joanna stood up immediately. Will and Joanna apologized, glanced at her, and slipped away. Joanna was about to walk away, but Mrs. Connally stopped her, so she stood still. Connally talked to her a lot, and his words were firm, powerful, and cold. After he finished speaking, he said to Joanna, "My dear, you probably understand, don't you?" Joanna said, "I understand, Mrs. Connally." Mrs. Connally said, "Then you should be a knowledgeable woman, and from now on, you can't think about Will anymore." Her voice was extremely kind, because she felt that victory already belonged to her. It was such an easy thing to do! Unexpectedly, Joanna was not easy to get up. She said, "Mrs. Connally, I can't promise you this." Connally's face immediately changed, but she still used a gentle and strong tone, and said to Joanna, "Listen to me, don't meet him again..." After she finished speaking, she said good night and went back in a hurry. Here Joanna still wanted to chase after her and talk to Connally, but suddenly a person walked up from the darkness. It was old Robert. In his old eyes, Joanna was not Joanna, but Barbara, and she was wearing a fashion from decades ago. She whispered to Joanna, "Be careful, don't let Allen see us." Allen was Mrs. Connally's name, but Joanna didn't know. She asked repeatedly, "What's the matter, Mr. Robert?" Robert said, "My darling! My beautiful..." He stretched out his arms to hug her. He said, "Where have you been? I'm always waiting... This is almost a hundred years... We only have a moment together... The army is advancing... What did Allen just say to you?" Robert's attitude was extremely strange. She understood that Allen was Mrs. Connally, but she was very scared. She took a step back and said with horror, "She...she..." Robert said, "Let's not care about her." She is always against us, since the day she saw us kissing." He hugged Joanna, his mouth looking for her mouth. He shouted, "My dearest love...my dearest love!"</p>
<p>Joanna pushed him away with all her might, shouting, "Mr. Robert, don't do this!" She wanted to run away, but Robert stopped her and said, "Don't be afraid, I will come back from the battlefield, I will come back..." He bent down and kissed the edge of her skirt. In his eyes, it was not a cotton dress, but a new dress made of fine silk. He stretched out his hand again to grab her, saying, "Let me kiss you goodbye." Joanna shouted loudly, "Mr. Robert!" Robert stared blankly, as if he was gradually waking up from a dream. He said vaguely, "What did you call me? "Mr. Robert"? This is all wrong... That was many years ago... I will remember it... Tomorrow... I will remember it..." Will ran back in a hurry, shouting to Robert, "Uncle, you scared her to death." Robert chuckled and said, "Scared her to death? Me? You don't know." He walked away staggeringly. He was still talking to himself, "What will Allen do? I'm going to tell her that she's back..." (To be continued)</p>
