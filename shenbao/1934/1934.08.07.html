<p>時評</p>
<h3>希特勒試騐時期敬</h3>
<p>自奥總理陶爾斐斯被剌後。全歐震動。意大利且陳兵境上。以備萬一。設使德國當局之行動。稍不謹愼。卽難免引起歐局重大之糾紛。故當時各國對於希特勒如何應付此問題。已大爲注意。今粤事甫見平靜。而德總統興登堡以年老病故。德内閣變更憲法。集總統總理大權於希特勒一人之身。於是希氏之地位更爲重要。一言一動。關係愈爲鉅大。而與德有關之列强。對於德政局前途之發展。將愈爲關心。比爲情勢所必然者。昨路透社倫敦電。謂「俄國以對德關係。現猶未定。故對前途發展。頗爲惶虞。英國亦以德國時局爲慮。各小國亦復如是。一般印象。今冬將使希特勒受極大之試騐。其成敗或將於經濟難題决之。」吾人觀於今日希特勒所處地位之困難。路透所言。確有一爲估量之價值也。</p>
<p>就德國内部現勢論。對外貿易。日趨衰落。經濟狀况。尤未好轉。雖在國際間高唱軍備平等之論。但以財力竭蹶。卽令取得平等之權。仍難期諸實踐。且其舊日支持國社黨之中層分子。今皆以失望而漸抱反感。故希氏一派。雖極力宣傳内部若何穩固。然其動摇之象。確已無可掩飾矣。至以外交方面論。今日世人心目中認爲最危險者。卽爲德奥合併之一問題。蓋奥所處地位。界乎德意之間。復爲小恊約國對德之緩衝地。一旦奥國取消獨立。則凡爾體係下之和平局面。必將動摇。歐洲各國之平衡。必被打破此非特意國所不許。抑亦爲法與其他各小國所萬難容忍者。然而國社黨則念念不忘乎此。此次奥國事變。縱非由希氏授意或主持。然至少亦可見其平日對國社黨同情提倡之力。迨一旦舉事失敗。希氏爲自表其心跡計。將肇事逃往德境之黨徒。均加拘捕。始則喪失奥人之同情。而益堅其獨立抗德之念。繼則引起部下之懷疑。而减削其信仰領袖之誠意。故希氏今後。苟非具有偉大獨到之獨到之新懷抱。恐其對内不能解决經濟上之困難。對外亦無法以與列强奮鬥也。</p>
<p>再就德與英法之關係言之。英之外交政策。表而雖似近乎扶德抑法。有不欲使歐洲有一國獨强之傾嚮。然亦决不願爲助德之故而有妨已國之利益。更不願在此歐局關係緊張之情勢下。而有助長破壞和平之嫌疑。蓋英之主張。在保持現狀。自奥總理被害而後。英已深懼歐洲之從此多事則今日對於希特勒之自任元首·增加權力。此後將如何發揮其手腕。能不益爲注意乎。至法之與德。自有其根本上之衝突。希特勒執政之初。法卽步步加以監視。同時復努力促成東歐諸國之和平關係。利用蘇聯地位之重要。而與之訂結友好。種種布置旣成。則德國東不能越波闌以侵入烏克蘭及白俄羅斯。南不能突破奥大利以犯意。西不能渡萊茵而收回阿爾薩洛蘭二省。以我人觀察。此時希氏惟有忍氣吞聲。以遵守凡爾賽和約之範園而已。否則將有何法以打破此難關乎。</p>
<p>况自奥國政變而後。意大利圖謀維持奥獨立。更爲猛進。除拉攏法國及小恊約各國以植保障基礎外。一方扶助奥新政府之成立。一方限制德國勢力之伸展。今繼任陶爾斐斯之許士尼格氏。雖聲望不如陶氏。然亦爲一富有手腕之政治家。國衛軍在奥爲最强之武力。擁護獨立。頗具忠誠。而奥之天主敎會與猶太人。仍有雄厚之勢力。此次事變起後。全奥人士。對於德國社黨之感情大傷。出全力以防制德人之活動。此外歐洲各强國。亦皆集中注意於奥事。張目以視希特勒之如何應付。故今後希特勒應付之手腕。急進乎。緩和乎。仍守其原定之政策乎。抑有特殊之新方針乎。在此就任元首之始。誠卽爲希特勒最後試騐之時期矣。</p>

<p>（紐約）羅斯福總統今日從孟太那之格萊西國家公園發出廣播演詞、謂政府現方開始奮鬭、以保全農工業之利源、免受個人自私之操縱、又謂東西兩部彼此有密切關係、國家必須視爲整個的團體、而非支離的部分之湊合云、此爲羅總統倦遊歸來後第一次對衆發表之言論、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>氷島公園羅斯福總統今日在此間播音演說、數百萬人民同時得聞總統說明其包羅萬象之公共工程計劃、此次重要演說尚屬總統一月前巡視夏威夷以來之第一次、其詞曰「吾人之具體宗旨在建設人類幸福、此亦卽吾人使人更瞭解國家之需要也、今日之人民已非昔比、均能明瞭開發電力·改善航路·預防水旱兩災·預防森林火災·及均衡農工兩業等公益事業、政府意欲發展西部之實業、以前西部過於徧重農業、而以購買東部工業品爲已足、東部則向不注重農業、余知東西兩部各有相依爲命之處、但國家須從全體着想、不能視作一盤散沙也」云云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）去年三月羅斯福接任總統後卽從事於挽回經濟恐慌之厄運、今日聯邦儲備局及商部公佈之統計足以證明總統之努力已有長足之進展、失業工人恢復工作者自胡佛總統任内最後一月以至今日止、增加百分之三十五、新政實施以來國外貿易加增百分之五十五、物價因美元貶價及限制農産增加百分之二十三、而工商業之漸有起色亦可於各鐵路之收入見之、各鐵路之收入較一九三三年三月地曾加百分之三十一、建築業增加百分之八十五、百貨公司商務增加百分之二十六、公衆對於國家銀行恢復信仰、可於官方公佈之銀行存欵證實之、自一年前羅總統勒令各銀行停業而僅許少數信用卓著者復業、以至今日、銀行存欵已增加百分之二十五、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>當局意見</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨探悉財政部對於銀行界要求修改銀行儲蓄法之意見、（一）財政部爲執行機關、並非立法機關、自國府公布施行後、財政部祇能根據銀行界意見、呈請行政院咨立法院加以研究、（二）令飭各銀行依照儲蓄法第九條將存欵總額四分之一相當之政府公債庫劵繳存中央銀行特設之保管庫、爲償還儲蓄存欵之擔保、惟銀行界要求以其他資産作擔保、此點允爲考慮、惟據財政部調查各銀行之存欵、定期占十分之六、活期占十分之四、雖有一二銀行活期存欵超過定期存欵、但係少數、故繳存四分之一之證金、實無窒礙、（三）各銀行將儲存欵總額四分之一公債庫劵、繳存中央銀行、爲保持大信、或可由中央銀行邀請各銀行參加組織保管之云、</p>
<p>南京電云、滬銀行公會呈請修正儲蓄銀行法、行政院已接到此項呈文、卽將轉咨立法院辦理、據財部息、該法起草時、經銀行界派員參加、大致並無因難之處、甫在施行、卽經修改、殊無此必要、至第九條、各銀行應以四分之一儲蓄欵、購政府倆劵、交中央銀行保管一節、仍將貫澈實行、勢難變通、</p>

<p>公共租界工部局因人力車務委員會建議、公佈自八月一日起實施新章、車主車夫認爲妨害利益頗鉅、曾由人力車業公會特區辦事處、一再向工部局交涉展期無效、故八月份執照（一萬張）各車商均未領得、車委會擬另召新車主承領、雙方已趨極端、形勢殊爲嚴重、若昨晨再不解决、全市車商停業、有影響十萬餘車夫生計之虞、幸同業公會、除函請市商會·納稅會·及市政府·等各機關援助外、曾推代表殷芝齡·與工部局總辦鍾思·接洽、商定工部局與車商代表開對等會議、解决車商與車委會糾紛、以免擴大、影響十餘萬車夫生計、而安地方、上星期五日下午三時、在工部局會議室開會一次、未有具體結果、迄至昨日二次會議、始將該項問題完全解决、</p>
<p>對等會議</p>
<p>工部局於昨日上午十時、在工部局二樓一四零號會議室、召集雙方有關係代表舉行二次對等會議、工部局方面到總辦鍾思·總巡麥丁·車委會主任麥西·華董虞洽卿·會辦何德奎·車商代表殷芝齡·顧松茂·后紹菴·馬克施·陪爾·及江淮同鄕會主席成爕春·等十二人、由鍾思主席、白郎速記、席間首由車商代表將擬具之八項意見、逐條提出討論、雙方爭辯頗烈、旋卽採用表决制、以多數同意、（新聲社云僅麥西反對）作爲議决案、故議至下午一時一刻、始行散會、</p>

<h3>人民需要與政治關係</h3>
<p>吳市長在紀念週演詞</p>
<p>中央社云、上海市市政府昨舉行紀念週、由市長吳鐵城領導行禮後、並報告「人民需要與政治的關係、」略謂、各位同志、西洋古代有一個著名的政治學者柏拉圖、（Ｐlato）曾經說、「國家的創造、是由於應付經濟的需要、一個孤立的人、想用他一個人的力量、來應付自已的需要、到得完美的生活、那於事實上、是絶對不可能的、所以一定要倚靠社會、倚靠多數人合作的能、」大家都知道、柏氏的思想、直接淵源於蘇克拉底、（Ｓocrates）蘇氏論國家的起源、也說、「國家是應人類需要而生的、人類有許多需要、無論何人都不能自給、人定要許多人來滿足他各人的需要、這個人爲了這個目的需人帮助、那個人爲那個目的需人都助、當這些互相帮助的人、合住在一起的時候、就産生了國家、這個組織、人類到了這個時候、才開始有國家的觀念、所以眞正創造國家的、便是「需要、」（Ｎecestiy）我也常常自已想、我們凡是做一件事、决不是一個人的一手一足所能成功、必須要得到大多數人的同情、與切實贊助和合作、然後這件事才可成功、不論公家的事或私人的事、我想都不能有例外、尤其是我們政府當局、在中國今日百廢待舉的時候、我們應如何想法喚起人民、使人民對於政府表示同情、但是單是得到人民的同情、而不能得到人民的贊助與合作、我們的政治、還是不能多所發展的、中國人民的政治慾、向來是很少的、因中國的政治、過去是消極的多、因此養成了人民一種習慣、對於政治、是很消極、因爲人民對政治消極、就使政治很難積極的去謀發展、所以我們僅僅是得到人民的同情、還是不够的、我們必須除了努力、使人民對我們表示同情之外、還要努力、使他們拿他們的力量、來帮助我們、與我們合作、這樣、在此百廢待舉之時的中國政府當局、要舉辦一事、才能舉辦起來、方有成功的希望、我們如何使人民能够切實的來帮助我們與我們合作呢、有一點我們應該要知道、就是「需要」、如果人民能够知道今日國家的需要、人民一定能够帮助政府、與政府合作、來建設國家、所以我們當今的急務、就是要使人民知道今日國家社會的需要、「需要一這兩個字、可以說是今日人類的幸福、與世界文明推進的力量、因爲由於這種人類的需要、使世界才有今日這樣進步的文明、使全人類才都得到今日的幸福、所以需要就是人類進化的推進的力量、也是世界文化創造的力量、</p>
<p>我這個理論、並不是因襲西洋學者的舊思想、而是有一個很顯明的例子、爲佐證的、我們只要看看廣州與上海兩市的建設情形、就可以知道、先講上海、上海人口、約三百餘萬、有五分之二、是住在特區的、這五分之二的市民、是全市中最有力量的人、其中熱心贊助政府參加建設者固多、而一部分人以爲他們的生命財産得到保障、他們的「生活慾」、便算滿足、所以對於特區以外的一般市民所需要的事業、時常忽略、不甚注意、但是廣州、略有不同、廣州雖然亦有租界、但是所謂租界「沙面」、是很小的、且不許中國人居住、所以廣州市的人民、都是住在生於斯長於斯的廣州市、因此他們與政府發生一種共同的需要、都能够盡力來帮助政府、與政府合作、將市政建設起來、振興起來、才有廣州市今日這樣建設的成績、這是一個需要與政治關係的極好的例子、所以我們政府當局、最先應成一個廉潔的政府、不貪贓枉法、大家做一個好的官吏、以博取人民的同情、但是、因爲我們要積極的做事、積極的建設、單是人民的同情、還是不够、我們還得使人民知道、他們生活的需要、如果人民能够知道他們生活的需要、他們的生活慾、就能有相當的擴大、就能自然的來切實參加贊助政府的一切建設事業、與政府合作進行、如此我們政府所要做的事、不論大小、都可有成功的希望、</p>
<p>講到這衷、我覺得本市現在有一個極大的需要、應當從速進行、這就是在兩月前、已發表過的、建築平民住宅、這一件事、我常常說、也常常聽人家說、有所謂亡國的現象和興國的現象、敗家的現象和興發的現象、但是這些現象、從什麽地方、可以看得出來呢、就是從一般人民的生活裏可以看得出來、所以蔣委員長提倡新生活運動、不僅消極方面、要改善一般人民的生活慾、可說是新生活運動最大的目的、使人民知道他們的需要、人民能知道他們的需要、就一定能立志向上奮鬥、能立志向上奮鬥、也一定能够拿他所有的力量、直接的或間接的、單獨的或共同的、來創造來參加一切所需要的事業、以滿足他們生活的慾望、這樣、一個國家或一個民族、才能新興起來、因此我想現在合上海全市人民的力量、來建築一個平民住宅、我們知道上海約有三萬間茅屋、平均每間茅屋住五人、則共有十五萬人住在茅屋裏、這十五萬人、日日在過着貧苦的不規則不合理不衛生不健康的生活這種生活、不但影響市容治安、以及公共衛生等、並且使平民敎育、也很難入手、所以、我們要改善平民的生活、從消極方面來做很容易、並不難、或專拿政治的力量來做、多少也可以收得一點效果、但是這個效果、且一時的、不是永久的、因爲我們没有從根本上增加他們生活的智識、擴大他們的生活態度、使他們知道需要、使他們能從實際上改善他們自已的生活、所以我們建築平民住宅的目的、在消極方面、因要改善他們的生活、使上海市十五萬的平民、可以居住在一個比較好的地方、度着比較合理有規則及較健全的生活、在積極方面、還可以施以種種平民敎育、增進他們的智識、增大他的生活慾、使人們也能立志向上奮鬥、都成爲很有力量的市民、因此建築平民住宅的功效、不僅是消極的、可使全市市容治安公共衛生平民敎育等種種問題得到相當的解决同時又因他們生活改善、以及生活的智識、增加了以後、使他們更積極的能智道更大的需要、能够積極向上奮鬥、來共同解决都市的重大問題、謀都市的繁榮、總之、人民的「需要」、與我們政府做事很有關係、人民能知「需要」、就不獨能同情我們建設、並能切實的參加幫助、我們建設、但是如何使人民知道需要而來贊助我們、還是在百廢待舉的中國今日、我們所應努力的、</p>

<h3>讀書消息</h3>

<p>目錄</p>
<p>（一）我的讀書方法</p>
<p>（二）本週播音</p>
<p>（三）介紹南北四大文學雜誌</p>
<h3>我的讀書方法王蘭生</h3>
<p>我們讀書，是因爲要滿足知識的慾望，因爲要在這社會獲得生存競爭的充份力量。因此我們對於讀書的方法，也就不能不注意了，果然有了一種好方法，讀起書來也就更容易領悟些，我且把讀書的方法寫幾點出來，以備朋友們大家的參攷。</p>
<p>（一）用腦我們拿了一本書到手，必定要用頭腦子想一想，想一想便能發生疑問，故善疑是讀書最要緊的功夫。梁任公先生說：「夫學問之道，必在懷疑，然後就有新問題發生，有新問題發生，然後有研究：有研究然後有新發明」。這就是呌人讀書必須用腦的方法。</p>
<p>（二）用口一般人讀書的缺點，就是不肯熟讀，好像對於讀書這件事，有點難爲情的樣子。古人道：「口而誦，心而唯」，這兩句話就是說，嘴裏仿着，心裏還要想着。能把一種書念熟了，便能生巧。又於無形之中模仿着，因爲先有模仿，然後必有創造，所以熟讀是很重要的。尤其對于學外國文時是如此。</p>
<p>（三）用手關於用手這個利益就很大了，我們把每天所讀的書，遇有心得都記下來，作爲日記。到數年後再把牠整理一下，便能成爲一本有價值的書了。所以顧亭林先生的日知錄，所以如此的有價值，如此的有名聲，就是這個道理。還有作文，亦須時常練習，練習的次數越多，文章越精細。</p>
<p>我們要做個學術者，或是發明家，總歸是要腦想嘴念手寫的。中外多少學問的成功者，誰不是這樣做的呢？</p>
<p>本週播音</p>
<p>（一）上次本欄發表的怎樣看電影未能全部刋出，請讀者原諒。</p>
<p>（一）凡本週以後的讀者來信，如果不是用本部製定的讀者通訊箋寫的，本部可不作覆。請未買通信箋的讀者從速購買。</p>
<p>（三）讀書問答第一集刋行以來，蒙讀者不嫌淺陋，時時給我們以鼓勵，直至現在，第一版三千份早已告罄，而來函購買者仍日有數起。兹爲副讀者盛意起見，已趕把第二集編好，不久當可與讀者見面。</p>
<p>介紹南北四大文學雜誌</p>
<p>我們接到許多愛好文學的讀者的來信，因爲目前文學出版物的蕪雜，要我們介紹一兩本比較靠得住的可讀的刋物。這工作說起來旣很需要似乎也很容易，而實際却是很困難的，在目前要求一本内容篇篇可讀，期期充實的刋物，還不可能。幾個聞名的文學雜誌，也只是因爲維繫讀者偶爾刋載一些足够滿足讀者的東西。所以在這裏我們首先要聲明的，是我們願讀者不要迷信某一刋物，而要用自已的判斷力，從那比較可靠的刋物中去找尋你們所要讀的作品。兹將南北四大文學雜誌的最近一期的内容略介紹如下：</p>
<p>文學八月號的文學，質的方面，比上一期的特大號還要好。論文方面，矛盾的「氷心論」，陳望道的「大衆語論」均堪稱觀點正確，發揮詳盡之作。創作方面，「賑米」，「山中送客記」和「新年是不准哭的」，均是現社會生活的實錄，可以一讀。</p>
<p>現代八月號的現代，無論在論文和創作方面均是比文學要遜色的。幾篇論文，没有一篇是新鮮可口的東西，創作則只有張天翼的笑」比較勉强可看。</p>
<p>文學季刋第三卷的文學季刋，在内容上還是和以前一樣的非常龐雜。特别是論文，六篇論文中均是以紳士的娱樂的態度寫出的東西。創作則有菜販子條燕，懶捐值得一讀。</p>
<p>當代文學這是一個新起的剛出到二期的刋物，這一期比第一期史進步。論文方面，「文學上的浪漫主義」是不能不一讀的文章，文學批評建立諸問題，及關於詩歌，前途的諸問題均提供了讀者一些關於文學批評和詩歌的具體意見。創作方面，雖然並不多，但每篇均值得一讀的作品。這刋物惟一的缺點就是書評做得太不够，然仍不失爲一個較好的刋物。</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>車壁上也漆着許多五色斑斕的壁畫，不過畫的内容，已偏重於故事；而這些故事，又都是從中國那些有名的舊小說或傳奇上摘下來的。譬如像「姜子牙斬將封神」，「關雲長千里走單騎」，也不乏激發人們忠孝心的用意。就是在那四個滿盛鮮花的大瓶上，也同樣有這種故事畫繪着，而旦是繪得很精細的。</p>
<p>太后生性很歡喜花，除掉那四個大瓶裏所供養着的四種之外，伊另有許多小巧玲瓏的花瓶，！每一個花瓶都有一隻特製的紅木架子，彫刻得非常工細。！東一個西一個的隨意安放着。瓶裏也盛着一些水，然後揀伊自已所愛好的幾種花草，敎人截斷了長的梗子，分插在裏面浸潤着。因此，這一座小朝廷上差不多已滿佈了花的香味，何况那些花的顔色，又都是異常的悅目！</p>
<p>除掉那一間小小的寢宫，和這一座富麗無比的小朝廷之外，這一輛火車所餘的地位已是很有限的了。但在後端，也還有兩間斗一般大的小房間攔出着，一間便是供給我們幾個女官當不輪到值班的時候，在裏面休息着，以便隨時承應太后。在這一間屋子的後面，還有一間比較小一些，其中祇安着一具小小的炭爐，那是專給太后預備茶水用的。負責照料這件事務的太監便是張德，也就是每次當太后進膳的時候，站在旁邊捧碗端菜的這個人。然而在事實上，他的地位已較别人爲高，這些烹茶者茗的小事情，那裏還高興認眞擔當，好在也没有人去監察他，他儘可以在那些小太監裏面，挑一兩個比較精細些的來代替也工作。（九九）</p>
<h3>正午在外灘</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>當江海關上的大鐘，很有音韻地打着十二下，雖然太陽是高掛在當天，十字街頭的巡捕的身影，已完全縮到了那雙笨重的大皮鞋下面，馬路上的柏油路面，已溶解得踐踏着像踐踏在被絮上面時，沿外灘一帶高矗入雲的大建築下面的人行道上，外國人，中國人，男人，女人，從每一個高大建築物的大門裏，一大批，一大批，的吐出來。由南往北的，由北往南的，你擠着我，我擠着你。</p>
<p>街中心是電車，汽車，像穿梭般的由南往北，由北往南，每一輛車裏，是擠滿了人。人力車，自行車，也載着人，很怱忙地夾在中間，來來去去的點綴着。黃浦江裏，渡輪是紛紛地載着浦東的搭客往浦西，載着浦西的搭客往浦東。方頭的擺渡船，像落葉般的舳板船，也由東往西，由西往東，運輸着搭客。</p>
<p>這些人，不怕在烈日下面奔波着，爲的是回去裝飽每一個唱着空城計的肚子。這些人，據說也就是造成上海繁榮而偉大的勇敢的戰士。但是在黃浦灘邊，却有另一個階級裏，已被一般人所遺忘了的人們，雖然江海關上的大鐘，已打了十二下，雖然肚子裏也唱着空城計，但還是在强烈的日光下，喊着「耶許」，出賣勞力。但輪不到算是繁榮上海的功臣。</p>
<h3>郎神與封神榜</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>以前我曾爲了老郎菩薩，翻過許多的書，有一種說數，老郎就是封神榜上的灌口二郎，不可信，這是完全因了「老」和「二」兩字的音聲相近，就附會懸揣上去了。並且二郎的本身問題，也没有一種肯定的解答呢。</p>
<p>王壬秋先生到過灌口，那地方時常隂森森地，所以土人說「灌無」日晴。」壬秋說：「以雪山隂氣勝也。」雪山上面有城隍廟，就是奉祀着二郎，據他說二郎有三種說數，「一云孟昶，卽挾彈張仙，後分爲文昌及水神者；一云玉皇外甥；一云周初仙人楊戬，皆不經之談。何蝯丈曾奏更正，後傳以爲李冰之子，亦不經也。朝議以爲三目瑰象，嚴事已久，不可更正。今乃塑美少年，而幔掩其怪象，他日遂成一臆造正典，反不如玉皇外甥之古雅矣。」</p>
<p>何暖丈大約是何子貞、子　是道州人，灌口屬四川成都，不知道是何因緣？奏請更正。張仙有人說是蜀主孟昶，和二郎自然不相干，至是外甥和周初仙人，都是根據封神榜的，可見小說影響於社會是很大的。</p>
<p>說起封神榜，本來没有人知道作者是誰的，近人孫楷第，在日本内閣，文庫，瞧見明本封神演義，題着「許仲琳撰」，方始把四百多年的悶戎蘆打破，仲琳是南京應天府人，號鍾山逸叟，可惜他的歷史不詳。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>他說到這句話，聲調非常高，好像他對於這件事很有把握。桂枝也但願自强不曾向醫院裏去，到了次日，早上依然讓趙翁出去打聽消息。從這日起，趙翁没有别事，一睜開眼睛，便是出去探訪兒子的下落。一直到了第四天，覺得什麽也探聽不出來，自已躺在床上，暗暗的哭了一塲，昏沉沉的睡了過去，也懶得起來。趙家幾個人按着這幾日平常工作，除了向有關係的各方面打聽而外，還得買幾分報看看。雖然在報上找不着消息，但也不肯把看報的事丢開了。果然，今天找出一些路子來了，報紙上登着，病院裏有個受傷連長，是由平安堡來的。桂枝日日等不着消息，自已也有些情急，這時也來不及通知趙翁，坐了人力車子，逕直的就向戰地病院來探訪。一下車子，便見着一個中年婦人，帶了大小三個孩子，在那病院大門口，和一個門警在那裏談話。桂枝在一年以内，曾和他見過兩回面，認得明白，這是關耀武的女人，也就是自已的表嫂，便呌道：表嫂你也來了。他回轉頭來，不曾寒暄，先歎了一口氣道：表妹，你瞧是怎麽好。我這幾天，魂都不在身上啦。聽說躺着一個連長，也許就是他。問這門口的巡警，他也閙不清楚，我們進去瞧罷。你也是打聽趙連長的下落來了吧？桂枝見了他，立刻覺得裏面這個連長不一定就是自强，也許是關耀武，心裏有點失望了，答應了是，跟着向傳達處走來。他們到了傳達處，有位五十來歲的老太太，拭着眼涙問傳達處道：我的兒子呌田青，他是個連長。報上不是登着有位連長，是由平安堡回來的嗎？我想，那準是我的兒子。勞您駕，讓我進去瞧瞧。傳達道：只要有這樣一個人，我爲什麽不讓您進去瞧呢。不錯，平安堡，是有一個受了傷的連長在這裏。他這一說不要緊，老少三個女人，一齊興奮起來，向傳達望着。田老太太道：他不姓田嗎？（四五○）</p>
<h3>洗澡</h3>
<p>— 子云</p>
<p>洗澡，似乎不過是脫掉了上衣，褪掉了下衣，坐進浴盆去，用水拖一陣，擦掉些汗液膩垢，把浴巾絞乾了，週身一擦，便完成了。</p>
<p>但在上海，却有不知若干種的洗法，而且各種洗法，有各種不同的意義與滋味。</p>
<p>淋雨浴，是站在有蓮蓬頭的自來水下面洗的。這是洋鬼子的洗法。開關一開，水從蓮蓬頭裏，直噴下來。站在蓮蓬頭下洗澡的給水一淋，忙用乾毛巾擦得週身發紅，便算了。據說這是很有益衛生的。一切新式建築物以及體育機關裏，都有這種設備。</p>
<p>蒸氣浴，是把整個人身，裝在特製的蒸桶裏，用蒸氣蒸的。所露在外面的，就不過是一個頭部。這種浴法，是歐洲傳來的，據說，可治宿疾。但是在上海的蒸氣浴，却是帶有神秘色彩的，因爲浴後還有西洋美麗女子給按摩呢。</p>
<p>海水浴，是須趕到高橋海水浴塲去洗的。海水浴，對於人體健康，有極大年益處。還有一層。這年頭兒，凡是皮膚黑得像南洋土人般的女士，越算是合於健康美。所以海水浴塲的沙灘上，常有一對對兒摩登男女，週身蘸着海水，直挺挺地躺着，使雪白的腿臂：曬成紫褐色。</p>
<p>到虹口公園去洗冷水浴的，美其名曰游泳，但在實際上，十分之九，都是去浸上一二個鐘頭而已。</p>
<h3>飲冰室妙聯</h3>
<p>— （懦弱）</p>
<p>暑初奇熱，爲六十年來所僅見，長日炎炎，夾道之售冷品攤若肆，乘時激增，猶憶神秘街迤北，有新設之某飲冰室，門次綴一聯云：一暴日相侵，試問同胞思雪否？」「炎風是襲，何妨大衆飲冰乎？」按上聯「暴日」二字，兩用，讀者自明，「雲」乃粤人於冰之稱謂，亦克作湔除解，琸聯「炎風」可釋義爲東北，（見辭源）「飲冰乎」云者：則隱具「甘於冷淡耶」之意，對偶旣整，語更雙關，如斯佳搆，不知出自何人手筆也。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>夏天食品</h3>
<p>— 南人</p>
<p>季候的不同，人們吃的東西跟着也變易了；但這里所說的變易，只是指食品的一部分，而不是指全部分。譬如冬天我們吃飯，菜哩，非熱辣辣的，味道濃厚的不行；到了夏天我們仍是吃飯，可是菜的熱度以及烹飪的方法就不與冬天相似了，尤其是那些零星的食品。我這里所要介紹的，也就是屬於零星食品的一類，但筆者是南方人，這種零星的食品當然只限於南方盛行的。</p>
<p>（一）芝蔴糊芝蔴據說是滋潤腸胃的東西。夏天因爲吃多油膩的食物，肚子里便會滯積了起來，覺得不很舒服，所以有人便拏這種芝蔴攙一半白米，用水浸過了相當時間，使它已經鬆化了，然後把石磨很容易的磨成芝蔴米漿。磨好了之後，再放這芝蔴米漿下鍋里煮；最要緊的，是一邊煮一邊要用潔凈的小木棒子在里面搗，使它不致有些變成了糊團。煮過了約莫有半小時（這要看芝蔴米漿的多少），芝蔴米漿沸了起來，便放下些糖，糖的量總以適合爲妥。這些工作都做過了，滋潤清甜的芝蔴糊便成功了。（芝蔴有黑白之分，普通以黑的較有益！）</p>
<p>（二）綠荳湯綠荳湯的益處，似乎已有人說過了，恕我不再饒舌，我在這里想要介紹的，是綠荳湯的另外兩種做法。Ａ把綠荳洗凈，放下鍋中，再放多量的水，明火把綠荳煮起來。經過了數小時的樣子，綠荳與水已融合在一起了，分别不出那些是荳，那些是水，這就成功了一種正式的綠荳湯，因爲它只見湯，不見荳與水了。當然，我們尚不應忘記的是放下些糖，如果能加入些蓮子，陳皮之類一起煮，那更是再好不過的了。Ｂ把綠荳用石塊來輾碎，使綠荳的殼與肉分開來，然後放下水里，殼因爲輕乃浮在水面，我們把它撈掉，沉在水里的荳給浸了些時，便拏出來透乾。另一方面，我們煮些開水，和些薯粉，糖，陳皮汁，使成了一些不清不濃的湯，這時剥了殼的綠荳便可以放下去跟湯煮，但只要一煮涕，便可以最出來應用了。（煮後才下陳皮汁更好！）</p>
<p>（三）清心圓我們平常見慣的湯糰，都是用糯米粉做成的；我現在所要介紹的清心圓，是捨糯米紛而用薯粉。薯粉是用薯子磨成的，大概食物舖子里有得買。我們把薯粉用些水開了，慢慢地用手搓揑，不久粉便成爲一大黏團，再從大團搓成無數的小條，如鉛筆桿一般粗大便可，然後用刀來切成一片片；切成之後，放入已經沸了的清甜的糖水里煮，煮熟了時，圓會獨自地浮上水面，這時，又是一種清甜圓滑的清心圓成功了。這種圓用薯粉做成的好處，是取其煮熟之後全身透明的，如白玉一般，而且又滑溜溜的是入口便不想把它吞下肚里！如果在湯里再把些百合，蓮子之類的東西一起煮，便是不錯的！</p>

<h3>體用論</h3>
<p>— 洞若</p>
<p>張之洞在數十年前發明一句話：「中學爲體，西學爲用。」這實在是很有點道理的。那道理並不是由於他指示了我們什麽接受西洋文化的態度，而是這句話數十年不斷地應騐，顯示出他是道着了事實的一個預言。夫所謂「中學」者，卽是我們固有的社會體制中所産生的文化總和；所以倘使「中學」所依據的社會體制存在！或部份地存在的話，則其接受西洋文化的狀態，便不得不是以中學爲「體」，而以外來的西洋資本主義爲「用」了！</p>
<p>「孝」是我們固有的「體」，ＰountainPan在潔白的洋信箋上寫着：「父母親大人膝下，敬禀者」，不是西洋得來的「用」嗎？</p>
<p>「迎神賽會」，是我們固有的迷信的「體」；但是用了這大的運貨汽車，上面載着許多人舞動的黃色的龍像飛一般地駛過，向一般市民宣告不日要舉行的ＸＸＸ大會，有誰能說這不是物質文明之最巧妙地被所謂精神文明役「用」呢！</p>
<p>明白了「體用」說在中國的妙用，便不難使我們明白靈乩圖之應用科學，不是無因的了。這些只是一個目的，就是以西學爲「用」，來鞏固我們的精神文明存在而已！</p>
<p>然而，這是心勞日拙的，帝國主義早摇動了我們「中學」所依據的社會體制，西洋文化所給予我們的「用」，早使我們自覺有變更我們的體制的必要。</p>
<h3>在昭通的時候</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>在悶熱的小屋子裏，想着不能到海濱或湖畔去旅行，自是恨事，然而飯後躺在椅子上，靜靜地回味着從前夏天到過的那些城市，却也是不無興趣的。</p>
<p>首先想到了九年前住過的昭通，那是在雲南迤東的一個大城市。當時我還是以一個學生的身份，出現於那兒的街道上和客棧間的，雖然離開我最後一次進的學校，已經二三千里路了。</p>
<p>在一家舊書舖子裏，胡亂地翻翻書，偶然遇見了一位宣道中學的敎員，談起話來，知道他曾在我所住過四年的成都，讀過好幾年書的，學校便是外國人辦的華西大學。邀我到他城外的學校去玩時，經過城門洞看見貼在牆上的一些傳單，立刻使他摇摇頭，現出鄙夷的氣色，那情形，至今我還記得很分明。傳單上是激動着五卅事件的浪潮，聲言要用武力驅逐駐在當地的英美烟公司經理人，下面署名：「昭通學生會」。</p>
<p>學校正放暑假了，掛着爬壁虎的走廊下，綴着樹蔭的草地上，都没有着白制服的少年的踪影。我和他的足聲，便在靜寂的過道間，特别大聲地響着。伏在玻璃窗邊的一隻花貓，原是打着盹的，就驚得咪嗚地呌了一聲躱開了。</p>
<p>走進一間有着耶穌畫像的客堂時，他還餘忿未息地談着城裏學生不明事理只是胡閙的話些：丨</p>
<p>「你看，多笑話呵，這些中學生！人家英美烟公司，原是英國人和美國人合辦的，他們偏要說是英國人單獨辦的，硬要拚命地反對，現在更不得了，要驅逐，笑話，我看他們敢那樣做！反對英國人就是了，爲什麽還要反對美國人呢？：你吸烟嗎？」</p>
<p>一面就遞一枝香烟給我，我推辭不會，他便略略變了臉色，悄聲說道：</p>
<p>「這不完全是英國人造的呵！」</p>
<p>接着又說到他本人曾經問過　些學生：眞是狡辯極了，他們硬說「所謂英美烟者，是英國最美的烟的意思。哈哈（用一通笑聲，鄙視學生們的糊塗）</p>
<p>最後，他要我批評他的意見，我没有回答，只用話岔到另外的事情上去，因爲在他這聰明人的面前，我是願意保持沉默的。</p>
<p>也許我自已也有不對的地方吧，在昭通學生的排外聲中，我却還不時到福音堂去：這並非去聽牧師的傳道，而是在閱書報處，尋覓精神的糧食。因爲當時幾乎算是困在那裏了，要想動身到别處去，却懼於沿途皆匪，無法展開足步。可以暫時閒談的人，就只有萍水相逢的這位宣道中學敎員，而他却又太過於聰明了，令人開口不得。街上呢，簡直没有一處閱書報的地方，到處只看見在街邊擺設攤子零賣鴉片的人，鴉片的氣味，全洋溢在各條街巷。至今我一想起了昭通，便爲上覺得又嗅到了這令人頭昏的氣味。甚或偶然嗅到了那裏在熬鴉片的烟子，也會立刻想起了躺在暑天底下那些舊污街巷來的。大概在我這一生，鴉片和照通的連帶回憶，是永遠不會分開的吧。</p>
<p>（這樣一個沉悶的地方，只要有書報可看，便非去不可了，誰還管得着别人的非難呢？文化不發達的地方，文化的侵略畢竟是很難抵禦的。全中國都需要盡力發展自已的文化，昭通只是可舉的一例）</p>
<h3>災象下</h3>
<p>— 連珍</p>
<p>夏天來了，在烈日下，赤裸着全個身體，爬上蠻高蠻高的古樹，用着蛛網捉些蟬兒到市上去向兒童兜銷，都也足够可以支配一天的菜錢。呵，眞的，做媽媽的心太殘忍了，李三娘眼裏的涙珠制不住如潮般湧出來，呵！現在爲了父親的病，爲了父親的醫藥費，忍心的以二百元的代價把他絶買了，呵！父親的病固然不能不醫治，然而這小孩子是無辜的呵！李三娘的胸口爲涙水濕了一大堆，終於乏力地從車架上爬下來。</p>
<p>她無心再工作下去。想起丈夫雖然託着隔壁的李嬸嬸招顧着，不過李嬸嬸的小孩兒也病着呢，說不定分身不開。她把水車架用蘆蓆蓋起來，就在河裏絞起了烏黑的混泥水，週身擦揩了一過。腦海裏這時却儘是閃動着兩個不同的面影，漸漸地月亮像儼然變成了一個小孩子的頭廓。滿面涙痕，正喚着媽媽。李三娘的心痛眞如刀割。兩腿像棉花似的軟將下來。「我的小菱兒呵，小菱兒呵。」口裏不自制的喃喃地嚷道。但是一個轉念。那丈夫的病篤的樣子又衝進她的腦際。她的背上頓時又像被人打了幾杆，她終於像夢醒似的立刻逃樣的奔回家去。</p>
<p>家裏的門，虚掩着，裏面隱隱地聽有孱弱的呻吟聲，她把身體一閃地掩了進去，只見丈夫的呼吸正十分地急促，頭一伸一縮着，手足顫抖地，眼睛閉的不見綫縫，她連忙呌着「菱兒的爸，菱兒的爸」，但是躺在床上的菱兒的爸，像没有聽見似的，只顧急速地喘着氣，李三娘于是不得已，又忙呌着：李嬸嬸丨李嬸嬸！一會兒，李嬸嬸才一拐一拐的自門外拐了進來，「呵，三娘子，我的小孫兒吐瀉的厲害呢，一步都不能離開」，李嬸嬸焦急地道，「現在阿菱的爸怎樣了？」</p>
<p>但當李嬸嬸的眼綫剛落到阿菱爸的身上，她頓時記起了大兒子的垂死的景象，她有點慌了，只見李三娘還正撫摸着病人的身體；「阿菱的爸，阿菱的爸，要茶喝麽？茶喝麽？」連忙拖開三娘的身體，「快去請陳老伯來，要馬上來」。一面催着。</p>
<p>然而就當李三娘走出門外，阿菱爸的呼吸更促了，頭也伸縮的更厲害，一刻鐘的光景，阿菱的爸終於直殭殭地在床上不動了。</p>
<p>李三娘氣喘喘地，從外面奔回來：「陳老伯要到十點鐘才能……」剛說到這裏，不料一眼就瞥見了床上的直殭的屍體，只見李三娘變了臉色，猛然地就撲上床去，正沉沉地反合在死屍的上部：</p>
<p>「菱兒的爸，你往那裏去了？你往那裏去了？……」（完）</p>
<h3>中國語法需要歐化嗎？</h3>
<p>文公直給康伯度的信（七月二十五日）</p>
<p>康伯度先生：今天讀到先生在自由談刋布的大作，智道爲兩人侵略張目的急先鋒（漢奸）仍多，先生以爲歐式文化的風行，原因是「必要」。這我眞不知是從裏說起？中國人雖無用，但是話總是會說的。如果一定要把中國話取消，要鄕下人也「密司𢖼」起來，這不見得是中國文化上的「必要」吧。譬如照華人的言語說：張甲說：「今天下雨了。」李乙說：「是的，天凉了。」若照尊論的主張，就應該改做，「今天下雨了」，張甲說。「天凉了，丨是的；」李乙說。這個算得是「中華民國全族的「必要」吧？一般繙譯大家的歐化文筆，已足阻盡中西文化的通路，使能讀原文的人也不懂譯文。再加上先生的「必要」，從此使中國更無可讀的西書了。陳子展先生提倡的「大衆語」，是天經地義的。中國人間應該說中國話，總是絶對的。而先生偏要說歐化文法是必要！毋怪大名是「康伯度」，眞十足加二的表現「買辦心理」了。劉半農先生說：「繙譯是要使不懂外國文的人得讀」；這是確切不移的定理。而先生大駡其半農認爲非使全中國人都以歐化文法爲「必要」的性命不可！先生現在暑天，你歇歇吧！帝國主義的滅絶華人的毒氣彈，已經製成無數了。先生要做買辦儘管做，祇求不必將全個民族出賣。我是一個不懂顚倒式的歐化文式的愚人！對於先生的盛意提倡，幾乎疑惑先生已不是敝國人了。今特負責請問先生爲甚麽投這文化的毒瓦斯？是否受了帝國主義者的指使？總之，四萬萬四千九百萬（陳先生以外）以内的中國人對於先的主張不敢領敎的！幸先注意</p>
<p>康伯度答文公直</p>
<p>公直先生：中國語法裏要加一點歐化，是我的一種主張，並不是「一定要把中國話取消」，也没有「受了帝國主義者的指使」，可是先生立刻加給我「漢奸」之類的重罪名，自已代表了「四萬萬四千九百萬（陳先生以外）以内的中國人」，要殺我的頭了。我的主張也許會錯的，不過一來就判死罪，方法雖然很時髦，但也似乎過分了一點。况且我看「四萬萬四千九百萬（陳先生以外）以内的中國人」，意見也未必都和先生相同，先生並没有徵求過同意，你是冒充代表的。</p>
<p>中國語法的歐化並不是改學外國話，但這些粗淺的道理不想和先生多談了丨我不怕熱，倒是因爲無聊。不過還要說一回：我主張中國語法上有加些歐化的必要。這主張，是由事實而來的。中國人「話總是會說的」，一點不錯，但要前進，全照老樣却不够。眼前的例，就如先生這幾百個字的信裏面，就用了兩回「對於」，這和古文無關，是後來起於直譯的歐化語法，而且連「歐化」這兩個字也是歐化字；還用着一個「取消」，這是純粹日本詞，一個「瓦斯」，是德國字的原　不動的日本人的音譯。都用得很愜當，而且是「必西」的。譬如「毒瓦斯」，倘用中國固有的話的「毒氣」，就顯得含混，未必一定是毒彈裏面的東西了。所以寫作「毒瓦斯」，的確是出手「必要」的。</p>
<p>先生自已没有照鏡子，無意中也證明了自已也正是用歐化語法，用鬼子名詞的人，但我看先生决不是「爲西人侵略張目的急先鋒（漢奸）」，所以也想由此證明我也並非那一伙。否則，先生含狗血噴人，倒先汙了你自已的尊口了。</p>
<p>我想，辯論事情，威嚇和誣陷，是没有用處的。用筆的人，一來就發你的脾氣，要我的性命，更其可笑得很。先生還是不要暴躁，靜靜的再看看自已的信，想想自已，何如？專此布覆，並請熱安。弟康伯度脫帽鞠躬。</p>
<h3>發餉</h3>
<p>— 亞光</p>
<h3>我來自東（十六）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>長久的考慮，我終至於隨着許多中國水手和船客在停船數小時以後上陸，我足踏着敵國的土地，我在櫻木井的車站上，和敵國的男女們同上電車，在郵局及電報局裏，我開始發本政府僱員生活的辛苦，待遇之微薄，我開始和他們談話，在那「東京瀋陽將闢飛機郵航」的廣告下談話。我自已覺得是受侮辱，然而我忍着前進，從横濱到東京，半小時的電車可到。我因爲有朋友在上目黑，所以不直接到東京驛。轉了好幾次電車，再曲曲折折了走了不少黃泥小路，到了林别莊，在日本忍辱讀書，很消瘦的臉兒，在鮮紅的杜鵑花業中出現。</p>
<p>到了上目黑區域，你才可以看見實在的日本人生活。木屋子是那樣矮小，一間房子裏面又裝着那樣多的人。雖然房子内部，還不至於像江草棚那樣齷齪，然而在裏面所受苦楚，相差有限。街上堆着黃泥，汽車過去，灰沙同北平的一樣多，同南方的一樣糟。道旁的招牌及白地紅字的旗，同上海小東門一帶一樣的多而且雜。女人負着小孩，滿街的跑。店舖中大都是維新以前的裝飾，赤膞的也眞是不少，如果没有幾個日本文的招牌，和日本女人的衣服，你會猜疑你在山東的村鎭，或南京的王府巷或上海或吳淞的江北人區域中旅行着。</p>
<p>從上目黑到東京，最使你注意的是那無綫電收音機的到處囂呌。街頭巷尾，到處被無綫電播音佔滿。而出人意料之外的：美國用無綫電的目的，是求娱樂；日本用無綫電，却在招引警告。在東京多年的朋友告訴我，無綫電播音中，大半是預告裁軍會議之失敗，美國之擴充海軍，及日本之急需凖備。街頭男女，臉上都現着嚴重的樣子，你想找一個嘻皮笑臉美國人一樣的臉孔，在東京你會至於失望的。</p>
<p>東京的百貨商店，把妙齡女子裝扮起來，站在門口，招呼顧　。裏面女店員們，活像日本的玩具中之小囝囝。圓而帶扁的臉，厚塗着白粉。眼睛是一道圓孤，西式的衣服，缚不了她們過豐肥的身體。</p>

<p>昨爲夏節、外商銀行完全循例休業一天、雖華商銀行照常營業、然交易方面勢必限於國内一部份之進出、而無對外營業、故市塲形勢頗感清閑、洋拆市價、早午兩市仍開七分、已一週來未見變更矣、劃頭加水二分、拆票交易、早市轉賬二百九十餘萬、新交易四十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易二十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖四十餘萬、新做五十餘萬、銀行收解外商方面則完全停頓、而華商雖營業如故、然受外商休假牽制、究屬國内貿易爲數不多、昨市計收解票欵一百六十餘萬、各種貨墊雜欵收解約共一百五十餘萬、進出倉六十萬、而押匯欵與墊欵等均無所聞、錢莊洋公單收解三千八百餘萬、各路滙欵五十餘萬、又本市票據交換所六日交換總數、銀元八百二十八萬九千八百三十七元零三分、内計銀元四百七十四萬五千七百七十二元六角二分、滙劃銀元三百五十四萬四千零六十四元四解一分、</p>
<h3>小洋略露轉機氣象</h3>
<p>小洋市况、自連日跌落後、至昨始有轉機、按昨市交易、雖不十分暢達、乃存底不足求過於供故、市情亦略堅挺、江南小洋早市開盤即好一元五角、爲八百三十五元五角、午市輙同、早市做出交易三千角、午市無聞、廣東小洋早市曾跌半元、爲七百二十七元、午市回上一元、爲七百二十八元、而結果較前日尚好起五角、做出交易早市三萬五千角、午市五萬五千角、惟銅元仍與前日雷同、爲三百三十一千五百文、交易代價洋八千四百元、合數額二萬七千八百四十六串文、</p>

<h3>債劵暫呈盤旋狀態</h3>
<p>昨華商交易所、市况居然趨於盤旋之途、蓋以環境情形沉悶而混沌、黃郛北上、未有確期、英日糾紛、消息兩歧、市上四號雖已止賣、而散户人心、暫時未能振作、故市價暫入於盤旋、但料其亦暫而不久也、昨日經過、頭盤編遺及本月份裁兵、微好一二角、入後即見不振、五十號賣出較多、金短小五角半爲最多、次盤編遣及本月份裁兵小二三角、餘則又微好五分至一二角不等、市况盤旋、綜計市價結果、大都跌落五分一角至三四角、獨編遣及九六則好起一角半至三角、成交總數、計共九百零二萬四千元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約證劵股跌落最鉅</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（四日）紐約證劵交易所股票跌落最巨者、達四元光景、蓋因農具股軟弱所致、而農具股則因旱災减低農民之購買力而跌、小交易所市面亦降、債市則毫無趨勢、雜糧以收成消良惡劣而飛漲、大條銀每翁斯達四角七分、爲一九二九年以來之最高峯、此乃財長毛根韜聲稱政府將印新銀劵與繼續購銀之結果也、半日成交三十萬股、兹將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>標紗多空均存觀望</h3>
<p>紗市平定、形勢異常安靜、但現紗客銷尚堪維持、各基皆有進量、然仍難引起人心興奮、實以紗布倉庫中之存紗、仍無推銷機會、故外商大量之空額、安然不補、至於現紗銷塲雖佳、而行情趨漲之力薄弱、所以市面、又呈不死不活之狀、　　金雞平穩</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、美棉微漲數磅音、暗中人氣極其渙散、毫無振作之氣、多空兩方、均持觀望態度、因之市情極形平定、結果各月漲二·四·五角、成交統計一萬一千包、查賣出大孚三百五十包、源大六百包、元德三百包、愼記六百包、仁豐四百包、益昶六百五十包、恒昌四百包、恊生七百包、買進大豐一千五百五十包、長餘六百五十包、元一四百包、義成六百包、長豐七百包、潤康七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花靜待美棉估計報告</h3>
<p>棉市續疲、美棉微見回漲、本埠人心仍平、據一部份消息、國内棉産狀况、目前尚屬良好、所以買户不旺、陳棉有人套賣、市盤愈萎、惟某棉行吸收之額、已有三萬多担、就市塲情形測之、須待美棉報告後、再起變化矣、</p>
<p>鄭標閑散</p>
<p>標棉晨間開盤、美棉雖漲五至十一磅音、然陳棉被某廠套賣之後、市氣閑散、人心不振、塲中買户减少、市塲中一片暗澹氣象、交易亦少、大衆須待美棉估計發表後、再作進行計畫、結果各月跌五分至一角半、成交統計四萬八千二百担、查賣出大孚五千七百担、恒益一千三百担、賡豐四千五百担、均昶一千五百担、遠大一千一百担、元一二千三百担、益昶一千担、潤康一千七百担、恊成一千担、恒昌一千五百担、大昶二千六百担、新亨一千一百担、源興昌二千五百担、買進通記二千担、裕大一千九百担、大豐三千七百担、愼昌、千七百担、大福一千五百担、長餘一千二百担、愼記一千四百担、長豐二千担、同和一千四百担、新華一千一百担、同豐二千担、恊生一千担、一日間最高低及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>摩登婦女的勢力</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>今年秩屬婦女國貨年，似乎這些粥粥者輩，應該在國貨購買方面盡其愛國的熱忱了，然而按之實際，却爲姑料所不及。最近國際貿易局發表，我國婦女化裝用品脂粉香水等的入口，半年來計達八十五萬、較之去年度一百五十萬之數，殆有「後來居上」之勢。僅六月份香水脂粉進口，達七○·三三四金單位，合國幣十四萬四千零四十四元；而時髦婦女用限服裝四端之花邊，其數益覺可驚，總核本年六個月進口，爲國幣五十七萬七千九百六十二元。</p>
<p>這就無怪有許多人對於摩登婦女除顚倒她們的魔力之外，更敬佩她們經濟上所具的「勢力」了。可以記得不久以前，爲了一般婦女在夏天喜歡赤足，不着長統絲襪紗襪，本埠若干家襪廠營業突然低落，因而有函請商會轉呈行政院取締婦女奇裝異服，得以救濟之舉。婦女些須裝飾衣着之微，竟能使市塲的營業不振，也可以造成國家對外貿易的巨大漏巵，這何能不說是婦女在經濟上具有莫大的「勢力」！</p>
<p>誠然，一些摩登婦女一襪之微，至於關係市塲榮枯，國家財政大計、固爲經濟上的勢力：可是「折穿西洋鏡」看其底藴，却非摩而且登的婦女之幸。因爲目前百業凋敝到「每况愈下」，而婦女冶容修艶則「益臻上乘」，這絶非幾年來「男子平等」「婦女經濟獨立」喊出來的結果，而係賣身求榮站在洋鈿上跳舞的活劇。</p>
<p>經濟恐慌使整個社會生産减退，也就之隨而將婦女的地位降低，這就成了一般人鳭形鵠立胼手胝足，而部份婦女則惟恐裝束之不入時，蔚然獨熾之根源因爲目前女子大率皆慕「蘇季子之貴而多金」，能够裙布荆釵「牛衣對泣」者，實在踏破芒鞋也無處尋得。這使住「亭子間」的朋友打破「張秀才」的幻想，而呈現於女子眼中者，非巨公闊少、絶不能成爲「袒腹東床」的快婿。可是物競天擇，爲要繫着這樣男子的心，就不能不使許多婦女相競而作裝飾的講究了。懸價待估者，要追求，已有所屬者，須要穩定，許多涉足「交際」塲者，修飾更成了她們的職業。此風所屆，於是乎外國脂粉巴黎香水，就成了婦女「不可須臾離」的必須品了。這是化裝品入品數目之所以可驚，其無法挽救，正與女子之不得不摩登以求抛售相等。不管「婦女國貨年」，「提倡國貨」的宣傳說得如何動聽，終竟也不能變更女子以打扮作市招的習例。</p>
<p>所以這一種婦女的經濟「勢力」，其實是匍匋於經濟下的勢力，與其說牠能使女子達到男女平等，到不如說是增進女子被玩弄的性質。許多饒倖於有在時裝展覽會上陳列的婦女，且按下你們睥睨一切的驕傲心理，一思這一事態所具的客觀意義。</p>
<h3>夜歸</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>踏着月光，懷着一顆凄傷的心，從姑母家歸來。我是喜歡夜行的，明月掛在我的頭上，踐踏自已的影子，聽四野裏的虫聲蜩𧎐，像置身在一幅名貴的圖畫中似的，在小路上前進。偶然遠處的幾聲犬吠聲，就像那家茅屋前有黑影晃動着。如果是月圓時，風吹着稻浪，飄飄然步代都飄逸起來，我的胆量是這般大的。尤其是夏天，晚上被蚊虫纒擾而熟睡，雖然同居的人都在院子裏乘凉，但是我厭惡他們，壓惡他們滔滔不休地講述着人家不願意聽的故事，或東家長西家短的說壞話。其實我們那所院子也滿大的，三面砌了個花花墻，種着一些雜花，然而在鄕間已是很名貴的了。中間有三缸荷花，一陣陣的清香隨風撲鼻而來，人的精神也能爲之一振。在這樣幽靜的境界裏，可以各自拖了只椅子，在四面坐地，手中的蒲扇隨意地揮着，或者仰起頭來瞧着萬里無雲的明月，該是如何的悠閑，瀟洒。那些紡織娘在花墻中時鳴時歇，彷彿高山流水的音樂，我們應側着耳朶傾聽，天的疲勞，到這時候忘了個乾凈。然而你一踏到院子窗前，像進了遊劇塲一樣，我往往就旋過身來獨自到田野中去散步，我喜歡夜行這樣養成了習慣。</p>
<p>今天早晨，姑母家僕人來要我去，說是表姊歸家歇夏了。我是姑母家生長的，姑母像我的母親一般。表姊比我長五歲，對於我這個小弟弟她也像自已的弟弟一樣看待。姑母也曾也過一句戲言，說玉姐給你做老婆，但這是無論如何不能成立的事實。我們只知道「要好」，不知道其他。後來年齡長大，對表姊似乎愛戀起來，那時候赴上海讀書了，分别後兩個見面反見生疏，其實各人的年齡也是隔膜的原因。對表姊我是祇能存着愛慕的意念了。</p>
<p>去年她出閣，我校裏剛小考，姑母幾次信來，我不能回鄕一次，至今心中好像放不下這件事。現在暑假在家裏，中午時就到她家去了。姑母見我仍是那般的拍拍我的肩頭，摸摸我的面頰，她很喜歡我今年畢業了，問我還進大學。表姊郤清瘦了，見了我就避面起來。</p>
<p>午後我一個人到後河垂釣，那株我們當初手植的桃樹，已是開花結實了。憶起人生如朝露，眞想哭。這時候姑母跑來，也在河邊坐地，她遠遠的談起，談到表姊身上，說她丈夫放蕩，賭錢，宿娼，一個無所不來的壞坯子，表姊屢勸不聽，氣成了毛病，言下凄然。我聽着出神，釣竿幾乎脫手流去。</p>
<p>晚飯後，表姊低低地問我乘凉去，我毫不遲疑的跟蹤她到院子里。那裏像我家中一樣，騷雜的坐着許多人，見了表姊忙讓坐撩天，我們相對着不能說一句話。</p>
<p>我辭别出來，姑母留我住夜。我没有回答，表姊在院子門着目送我。踏着月光，懷着一顆凄傷的心，從姑母家歸來。四野的幽靜已引不起我的興趣，低頭懷念着那邊一顆同樣凄傷的心吧！</p>
<h3>胡想</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>胡想，是和做夢差不多的。無論是誰，在他的腦子裏總免不了會做着胡思亂想的時候；不過，只因這些想頭，多是與本身的名利有關，所以，將牠以文字赤祼祼地表白出來告訴人家的，是很少見的。</p>
<p>現在，我就來破個例，將我的一點兒胡想，在這裏說說吧。</p>
<p>幾月來，我常常這麽想着：自已是一個靠筆桿吃飯的人，就使托天之洪福，每月能撈個三二十塊錢來過活吧。成天禁固在寄所裏，吃吃飯，睡睡覺，看看書，寫寫稿，這樣的過日子，就有一百歲好活，又能拿得出多少貨色來？並且，生活的範圍是這麽的狹隘，幾個題目，換來掉去，總不會變出個新花樣來；譬如花呀月呀，寒呀熱呀，窮呀苦呀，……這些東西，不是一年到頭老見在一般人的筆端出現嗎？假使一旦題目用完了，而飯又不能不吃，那時就勢不得不剽竊和抄襲人家的東西，或專揑造事實和窺伺誰個文章有個小漏洞，來做自已寫文章的資料了。這樣的活着，還有什麽義意呢？</p>
<p>「生活的方式，無論如何總得改變改變一下子，丨丨不管是做官，爲農，經商，傭工，……」我這樣深深地覺到；但是，自已旣没有尖頭鏝的本領，又</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>没有大量的資本，或和那一位富商或大員是有裙帶關係，自然官做不成，商經不得；至於爲農傭工，自已没有三五畝肥美的田地，强大的臂力，魁偉的軀體，也自然是不會實現的。反覆思維着，總想不到一條較好的走路。最後，不曉怎的一來，竟想及徒步漫行全國這上面來。我以爲，像一個流浪漢一樣，一鄕過一鄕，一鎭過一鎭的行丐着，倘自已的生命不致於餓死，凍死，或被猛獸强盜所戮殺，走進累年苦受着天災人禍的農村，看看勤苦儉樸的老農們的姿態是怎樣，爬上五千尺以上的山嶺，嘗嘗寒冬夜空的滋味是如何，行過夕陽下的河邊湖畔，深入蒼翠欲滴的叢林，巍峨險隘的山谷，……看看那裏的景色又是個怎樣子，這樣一來，三五年過後，對於一個愛好文學的人，總不會是白嘗苦辛的吧！雖然，在目下的中國，一個窮困如洗的人，就使是徒步旅行，這欲望也是不易實現的；但是，如果願意把自已的生命來冒險，也未嘗没有一點兒實現的希望。</p>
<p>我這一點兒胡想，是十二萬分願望着能够得見諸實行的，未曉得尚有誰個也有這同樣的想頭，而肯來做我一個旅伴否？</p>
<p>附啟　鄙人這一點兒願望打算於九月十號前後實行倘有誰個也酷愛此道而願爲伴者請來函復旦大學何覺夫處以便再約面商</p>

<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>五點鐘被閙鐘的鈴聲打醒了，仰起頭來向對床望去，弟弟也正笑着看我。這似乎已成習慣了，雙脚蕩下地來，忙着打開窗子，讓隔宿的空氣換了新鮮的進來，就對着窗口行深呼吸，手一划一划地完全不像規則；然而這裏不是操塲上，也没有喊着一二三的體育敎員，隨便怎樣的胡來多少也是合於衛生的。</p>
<p>用冷水漱口，洗面，有時也擦擦上下身，弟兄倆個便提了茶壶出門。門前是一條淺淺的小溪，溪旁種着幾株楊柳，隨着晨風不時向水面私語。蟬聲已在樹梢頭聒噪，知了知了，是否是知秋將來，你們的生命就短在片刻嗎？</p>
<p>立上木板橋，凝視着溪中成羣的小魚，牠們那樣活潑地爭搶水面上浮來的食物。一會又藏到河底去，像一個怕羞的處女。這裏永不見捕魚者的踪跡，逍遥自在地過牠們一輩子罷。</p>
<p>沿對岸河邊向前走去，茅屋裏都是熟識的面孔，微笑就是打招呼，他們說不來「先生，早安！」隔夜的譌服正忙着要洗，今午的飯要在日出之前煮好，所以我們歸路的時候，他們早到市鎭上做賣買去了。</p>
<p>不知什麽時候一條小黑河跟在我們後面。抓着前爪，摇着尾巴，怪親熱的。鄕下的狗都是那樣可愛的，雖然牠見了陌生人也會竄上去高吠幾聲。牠們不希望坐汽車，吃牛奶餅乾，掉一點白米飯，他就每天在你們們前守夜。</p>
<p>到茶館店丨丨這裏到說的茶館，也是三間茅屋。一間是茶座，一間是店主人的住宅，他們是夫婦倆和一個十二歲的兒子，一間是早上買荳漿午後買點心而兼營着一切京雜貨：然而只要一說出店名老萬興，在附近已是誰個不知，那個不曉了。每天有很多的信是從這裏轉交的。這時候茶座裏已有幾個敞着上身赤了腿的茶客，也都是熟識的面孔。</p>
<p>「三官，五官早啊！」提上茶壺，授了四個銅子，老萬興老板總是這樣的說一句。</p>
<p>「忙呵！」就是我們的回答。</p>
<p>每天說來已成了習慣，但是並不討厭，兩言面都覺得滿親熱的；或者也是鄕下人率直的緣故。</p>
<p>提了荳腐原路歸來，斗大的太陽已從東方探起，沿路野草上的露珠閃閃作光。摸魚翁的小船剛划出去，那個白了頭髮的老李一定笑着說：「今夜再去聽大紅袍，要大破白雀寺了」。</p>
<p>手裏一緊，他的船已從我們背後箭也似射去。</p>
<p>老萬興茶館每年夏天總請一個跑碼頭的來說因果，五枚銅子可以聽一個鐘頭。每夜人很擠，有的自已帶了凳子來。鄕下没有什麽消遣，每晚來聽上了癮</p>
<p>歸家，合家的人都起身了。我們把院子裏的花都搬到書齋裏來，這也是我們弟兄倆個的嗜好。但是說起花，眞要羞死人的，都是那些風仙，鷄冠之類，後來討來幾株石臘紅，已作爲名貴的花種了。</p>
<p>昨夜燈下讀五弟的信，他說我心愛的那株單辮的石臘枯了，六十多歲的老李爲了田租抓去只一夜天死在監裏，他是個單身漢，由鄰居凑了錢買棺下葬的。他說今年茶館裏不請說因果，晚上没有消遣，希望我讀過的報章雜誌每禮拜寄他一點…</p>
<p>昨夜就一夜没有好睡，就是隔壁拉梵啞鈴的也變了個生手，那樣剌剌不休的擾人。</p>
<h3>蘇聯青年的飛行遊戲（上）</h3>
<p>— （莫斯科通訊引沅）</p>
<p>（一）帶傘跳落</p>
<p>一座飛機慢慢地在青蒼的飛機塲上面旋轉着，飛機所發出巨大的嗡嗡之聲，在龐大的（Ｉ）字附近的人聽來，已不甚清楚了。這座飛機，從下面看來，好似一隻張開兩翼的肉食鳥。在那一翼上，一個微小的影子，從機艙爬出，向下一跳，就頭向前地倒入虚空之中。下面觀衆的注意力，都集合在這個飄蕩於空氣中的微小的影子上面。</p>
<p>「這東西展開没有展開？」當這人影跌落之後的一刹間，一把大傘就在他的身上展開，那影子懸在大傘之下，漸漸地落下地來。這把下落傘在陽光明媚中照耀出一道虹霓，平穩地蕩漾而下，這個帶傘跳落的影了，在清朗的半天中，已可辨别他的形態了。最後落地了，飄摇於風中的下落傘，像帳蓬一樣在他的頭上張開着，他迅速地收了傘，并且裝了起來。</p>
<p>這時君衆衝向前去喊着：「怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「很好，很平穩地下來了，」這個人回答着，故示鎭靜態度，以代替他洋洋得意的驕傲。這樣的驕傲，是應該的，容許的。這是一個永不遺忘的一天，丨首次嘗試跳落的一天，現在他有權利把那帶傘跳落的綠色徽章，掛在他的胸襟上，這是一個表示勇敢和技巧的徽章。</p>
<h3>地底下</h3>
<p>— 奕</p>
<p>約莫五點鐘了。天上星兒隱約的模糊，東方的天邊，漸漸地現出了魚白色的微光，田園裏，草地上，叢林中，無數的雀兒在飛翶。小河裏的流水在晨光之下閃耀，蒙住着山林平原的黑影已是消散去了。黎明，這清靜和平的黎明已經來到了人間。</p>
<p>汽笛長吼的怪呌，驚醒了這山林中遠近的村落瓦屋裏的人們。他們知道，這是黎明到來的信號，他們每天開始操作的時間到了。</p>
<p>瓦屋上的烟囱，開始的在放送出縷縷地白烟。婦人和小孩在做着他們家裏的工作，壯年的男人，個個拿起了他們我作的器具丨丨煤汽燈和小鐵鋤，向着礦山工塲進發，在那平原的小徑上，一行行地她似是出征的隊伍。</p>
<p>在那山坡上，在那鐵路的四邊，佈滿着了工人，機輪轆轆地嚮動，昇降機從那地底下，那幾千尺幾百尺的地底下，吐出了一羣羣疲倦了，喘息了的工人，又從新的吸進了一羣羣精神滿足的人們。</p>
<p>他們，離開着了那自然的世界，那黎明的安息的人間，爲了生活，被送進了這在幾千尺幾百尺的地底下的世界。在這裏没有太陽，没有天空，没有山林，也没有河水。只是隂森森地充滿着污濕的泥水，黑漆漆地四面盡是臭氣和煤屑。這是另外的一個世界，另外的一個人間。</p>
<p>汽笛的呼嚮聽不見，人們的談笑聽不見，充滿着這地底下的，盡是一些喘息，用力，走動的微音。偶爾的一聲嚮亮，那是煤層的塌例的聲音，在這聲音之中，就會有人傷失了他們生命。</p>
<p>離開了自然，離開了人間在這深深的地底下，終日的有着這成千成萬的人們在操作。他們失去了生命的保障，失去了太陽的光芒，爲了生活，出賣了氣力和生命，永遠地在這地底下工作。</p>

<h3>某夜（六）李懷瀛</h3>
<p>其餘四個人歡迎着她，有如接待一個從戰塲上得勝歸來的戰士似的，齊聲呌好，凑到桌子前。鄭太太兩個女兒，一個十一歲，另外一個是九歲的，本來在弄堂裏玩着，她們看見邢太太買酒回來，猜到會有吃的東西的，打動了她們小小食慾，就跟着跑進來。</p>
<p>「怎麽不玩了？進來乾什麽？」</p>
<p>鄭太太看見她的兩個孩了，厲聲質問着，她的意思是不願孩子們看着她們喝酒的，她要把兩個孩子趕出去，接着說：</p>
<p>「出去玩去！」</p>
<p>孩子没有去，她們不願空着手回到外面去，劉太太看到孩子的眼睛釘在這些東西上，看出她們小小的要求，順手抓了一把花生米把兩個孩子打發走了。</p>
<p>「喝罷。」</p>
<p>邢太太提議。她說這句話時，像是下了好大的决心似的，臉皺得緊緊的。</p>
<p>寗太太笑着說：</p>
<p>「怎麽喝呢，没有酒杯？」</p>
<p>「你還用杯子？學那麽斯文幹什麽！不用杯子，人嘴對瓶嘴還不行麽！」</p>
<p>孫太太像是和某個人生氣一般，狠狠說着。</p>
<p>眞就這麽辦了，三瓶酒先後打開瓶塞，五個人傳着喝。</p>
<p>五個人除了鄭太太創太太有着三杯酒量，其餘三個人，平日根本没有讓嘴唇貼上酒杯過。這回，她們爲的要借酒消愁，就拚命地喝。</p>
<p>酒是甜的，心是苦的，涙是鹹的，灌着，燒着，流着，漸漸的儉紅了，口乾了，頭腦沉重了。</p>
<p>「我不信我們就該餓死的！」</p>
<p>「新疆啊，新疆是什麽樣的地方啊，爲什麽那個地方人們不去打日本，反倒自已打起自已來呢？……」</p>
<p>「醉罷，醉罷，醉過這一天去才好。」</p>
<p>喝着，說着，漸漸的，有人覺得眼前人物開始愰動了，屋子也在轉旋，邢太太，寗太太，孫太太，摔下酒瓶子，倒到床舖上，嘴角上吐着吐沫，嘔過一會嘔出一大堆的飲食物，淌得滿臉滿床都是。鄭太太和劉太太本待救助他們，不料自已也在不知覺中就倒在床了去了。</p>
<p>全屋中，充滿了濃重的酒氣。</p>
<p>夜丨深了，夜深了。</p>
<p>鄭太太的兩個孩子，唱着歌走上樓，她們預備睡覺了。一隻小猫，在她們之前，不知從什麽地方溜進屋子，用靈感的鼻子在屋中嗅了一會，悄悄地又溜出去了。（完）</p>

<h3>一個好萊塢妻子的自供（下）</h3>
<p>— 密薺</p>
<p>做著名影星妻子的不易　欲知其究竟請君一細讀</p>
<p>後來我們搬進了一所十八間屋子的圍大房屋，裏面有花園，游泳池，網球塲等等。但是在多看起來，却和牢獄一般。要這樣空空洞洞的地方做什麽？託特總是四處奔忙着，很少很少有工夫和我在一起的。幸虧他很喜歡我們的小孩子。那還是一件差强人意的事。有一次，那是在一個聖誕節的前晚，我們家裏開了一次宴會。我們的賓客一個一個蒞臨了。我們剛從樓上走下來，忽然聽見客人中有人在問；「你們知道弗利蘭和雪爾維亞·茜拉的勾當嗎？不知道弗利蘭的女人覺得怎麽樣？」忽然他們看見了我們，弄得窘極非凡。我就爬在欄桿上，裝作不在乎似的笑道：「她氣死了！她氣得天天早晨拿像你們一樣的小孩子當早飯吃哩」！這樣一來，一個小小的風波就算吹過去了。大家提高了眉毛，好像「咦」了一下子，不過空氣是鎭靜下去了，而我的毛脚亦冰冷了。那天晚上，賓客散了，託特抱住了我，吻着我的耳尖說道：「你眞是刀槍不入的硬石頭」。他不過說了那一句，但是我却已覺得是幾個月來最密切的話了。</p>
<p>後來公司裏的老板，要派他要中部和東部去旅行了。我是陪着他一同去的。當我們出發的時候，我覺得是自從託特做了明星以後，比較的最快樂的一天了。不過那亦是極短促的一晃，到了聖巴那定諾，一切都消散了。那時他正和我合讀着一段新聞……忽然四個女郎！像玫瑰花朶兒似的嬌嫩！闖進了我們的包房。她們亮晶晶的眼睛裏，充滿了崇拜的神情。她們的嬌艶欲滴的紅唇，爲情感的衝動而微顫着。我相信她們没有理會旁邊有我這麽一個人。託特替她們每一個，在她們的簿子上簽了名；爲了她們中間一個人所說的不知道什麽話，拍着她的手；然後將她們打發走了。從那時起，我就再也不能恢復我的原狀了。突然間，我感覺到不可名狀的疲倦。我想就是我有力量，可以和一個女人奮鬥，而保持我的丈夫，我怎能和天下的女人鬥？但是那又好像是我所不得不做的事。女人成羣結隊的來包圍他。到了一個地方，託特正攙着我下火車，但是一個女子將他的臂膀一拉，就被她拉開了出了。我隔了兩個鐘頭，才再和他見面。他跑到旅館裏，見着我笑道：「你看我這付光景，不成了紀念品的驚雀草人了嗎？」我一乍，果然不差的。他的領結亦没有了，他的衣領亦撕破了，衣服上一個一個的扣子，一齊不知去向了。到了第二個地方，更不得了了。他的下車還是許多警察，把他保護着下來的哩。進出戲院，亦都是要警察先生們的特别保護的。又有一天晚上，我們在客棧裏，辛苦了一天疲倦了。託特手托着我的下顚，和我像小孩子似的吻着。吓！那是多少時候没有的事了。我以爲我已佔了最後的勝利了。忽然在我們的背後亦來了一個很長的「吓……」兩個女人笑着鑚了出來，她們不知道什麽時候偷進來了，藏在沙發後面的。我覺得我一些私有些時間都没有了。他是每一個女人的……</p>
<p>到最後，我没有陪託特回她萊塢，因爲公司中急事呌他回去，而我的妹妹又病了，要我照顧照顧。這樣一來，我們又分散了兩個月之久。我回來的那天，託特爲我在家裏開着盛大的來家會。大人物和明星們，在我們家裏走進走出，户限爲穿了。我是很快樂的，但是倦極了，祇顧他們早些散去，讓我和我的託特兩個人，清清凈凈地休息温存一回呢。那天晚上，兩點鐘以後，賓客們散了，我正在打開我的行李，他向我說道：「親愛的，我眞對不起你。但是一切都完了。我不能永遠這樣幹下去」。我問道：「你說的是雪爾維亞嗎？」他說：「不是的。是珍妮斯·摩根」。珍妮斯摩根！一位中年婦人，大家稱爲美國最大的狐媚女子的！許多人都爲他而自殺了。託特當然還不肯提到離婚。提到離婚，是於他的前程不利的，也許連珍妮斯的也毁了。</p>
<p>我現在惟一的這指望，就是希望將來有一天、託特能回心轉意來歸向我。我們現在還是照舊的參加宴會，影片獻映，以及新聞記者試片等等。我的職份是和我的丈夫並肩站在門口，給過往的一切人展覽；我也必須裝着那心滿意足的笑容……目的就是要塞住一切造謡者的口。但是等到没有人看見的時候，我就溜走了，走後門回家去了……獨立一個人。妻子？不是的！我是個半死半活的，麻木的，無靈魂的子虚烏有。我是好萊塢一個大明星的擋風牌而已。」（完）</p>

<h3>評「愛的叛徒」</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>OnceTOＥveryWoman</p>
<p>丨國泰映</p>
<p>「愛的叛徒」和「一夜風流」同樣的是取材於Ｃosmopolitan雜誌的，但是，ＡＪ·Ｃronin與Ｓ·Ｈ·Ａdams之間存在着一個極大的差異，至少，前者在「愛的叛徒」裏的嚴肅的創作態度是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>「愛的叛徒」與「療情記」有部分的相似的地方，同樣是要求着醫生們對於人生不苟且，克盡他們救護人類的職責。</p>
<p>這裏，咒咀了失責的，自私的醫生，諷剌了倚老賣老而善妬的外科主任，聲斥了對病人没有慈愛心的冷酷的看護。</p>
<p>這裏描寫了一對一會兒打架一會兒和愛的老夫妻倆的情愛。犧牲於資本主義社會裏的給鏹水毁傷了臉的舞女的痛苦，對醫生說「救了她就救了我的年輕的，貧病的夫妻間的深情，而這些描寫都是很輕鬆的，細膩的，生動的，眞實的。我們可以在這裏看到導演的聰敏的地方。</p>
<p>「愛的叛徒」的劇作者的主觀的意見，要求着一般醫生和看護的對於人生不苟用，克盡救護「人類」的職責，雖然這「人類」二個字還成問題，我們承認劇作者的這種意見是可取的。</p>
<p>然而，我們也知道，「愛的叛徒」的劇作者的要求和整個社會改革的要求是分離不開的，但是Ｃronin氏却不曾理解這一點，他的幻想只是讓這二個克盡救護「人類」職責的醫生與看護在現社會制度下圓滿地結合，這不能不說他是近視。</p>
<p>「愛的叛徒」的成就，導演ＬambertHillyer和編劇ＪoＳwerling的功績，是不可抹煞的。處理得很經濟，清順，爽利。特别是在病人開刀時的一段的處理，室内的緊張的工作，呼吸球的迅速地漲縮，測量表的下降和呼吸聲的急促，屋頂上的旁觀者的驚慌的情狀和病人丈夫在隔室的緊握窗帘的憂急的内心描寫，像十萬噸的鉛鐵緊壓住了觀衆的呼吸。</p>
<p>演員都很平均，費蕾與華爾脫貝龍最佳，倒是飾巴克的勞爾夫貝勒美差一點。</p>
<p>在電影現實主義者的要求眞實聲中，這一張接觸到一些眞實的而比較令人滿意的影片，是很可取的。</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（ＢorntobeKissed）（九）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>那個地方眞是好像宫殿一樣，憶迪心想。上看着高高的天花板，下看着一切陳設的富麗輝煌，眞可愛極了。他們一走，走到一間翼室，潘其說那是他兒子的私室，别人不許到的地方。憶迪聽見了，心裏一高興，就信步走了進去，跑到陽臺上，俯瞰着下面銀波蕩漾的一片水。潘其看見她走了進去，就低聲對着他的兒子道：「你必須在這星期末到華盛頓的。你去想法了吧。」他說完了就走開了。憶迪回來一看。祗剩湯姆一個人，就覺得奇怪的問道：「你的父親呢？」湯姆道：「他去看行李去了。他順手檢了一個照相本子，遞給憶迪看。憶迪翻閱着，看見裏面有一張小照，一個小孩了，由一個奶媽抱着，嬉開了嘴在那裏笑。憶迪問道：「這是你嗎？」湯姆點着頭道：「我想你小時候，一定亦很好看的。」他很心愛似的看着她。憶迪說道：「可惜我不能加以證明。我的家庭是很窮的，没有錢拍照的。」她於是將她家裏的事情，講給湯姆聽了。她的父親的事，她的母親的事……，以至她和克新斯的相遇而訂婚等等，和盤托了出來。她並且將她手上的戒指，亦給湯姆看了。湯姆聽了她這一番話，心寰覺得有些感覺，就楞楞地看着她，一言不發。一回兒憶迪慢慢說道：「你的父親是不喜歡我的。」湯姆道：「當然他是很喜歡你的。你是我的女朋友當中，他請到家裏來的第一個。」他一回兒，又拉了她的手說道：「你放心好了。來吧。還有許行地方你還没有看見呐。」他開了一扇門，裏面是一間臥室。她進去看了一下，嘖嘖稱羨不置。</p>
<p>汽車的聲音，把她嚇了一跳。她爬在窗口往外張着。她下面停着一輛汽車，前面裝滿了行李，潘其坐在後面出門去了。憶迪不覺狂喊道：「潘其行狂！」潘其笑容滿面的揮着手道：「憶迪，再會吧！」憶迪回過頭來，很生氣的對着湯姆道：「這是你幹的事，是不是？」湯姆道，「咳，我們還没有兩個人在一起過呢。」憶迪道：「當然没有！你不要想！我回家去了！她手轉着門杻，但是門開不開。憶迪怒氣勃勃地對着湯姆道：「快拿門開開。」湯姆尖告道：「蜜你不用生氣呀。」憶迪漲紅了臉駡道：「你這是多有心肝的人呀。帶到我這個地方來，欺侮我没有派克街的大房了，欺侮我没有有勢家庭作我的後盾！」湯姆道：「我並不想拿你怎麽：呀……」憶迪喊着道：「當然你不能拿我怎麽樣！我亦不怕你！我從前亦遇見過這種事！我是能保護我自已的！」湯姆看了好笑道：「說呀！可愛的東西！」憶迪又說道：「你一生予取予求，總算得是稱心如意的了，但是你却没有懂得一件事，就是有感覺的，不止你一個人，人家亦有的。」她拉着自已的頭髮道：「我的頭髮，是有顔色的，不錯。我有些像不三不四的女人，不錯。誰都不拿我當是什麽好東西，但是我却從來没有看輕過我自已！「她的嘴髻都氣得發抖了。湯姆道：「你不用哄我了。你不是和我一樣是個活人嗎！」憶迪無可奈何地又哀求道：「湯姆，請你饒了我吧！你爲什麽不肯帮我一些忙呢？」（未完）</p>

<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Beijing from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Replacing Huang Fu to Negotiate Everything</p>
<p>General Huang Will Go to Lushan to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Report on the Course of the Dalian Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, departed from Moganshan on the 21st China Travel Service Zhejiang-series passenger train on the morning of the 6th and arrived in Beijing at 3 PM, staying at Room 348 of the Central Hotel. That evening, he visited Tang Youren, intending to visit Wang the next morning, the 7th, to report and seek instructions. Yin stated: (1) He came here to express and convey Chairman Huang's sentiments of thanks and persuasion to Wang and Tang. He also planned to seek instructions on the Beining Railway affairs from Minister Gu upon his return to Beijing. If Gu did not return to Beijing for the time being, he would first go north to pay his respects. (2) Chairman Huang is recuperating in Moganshan and is in good health. However, Huang had previously requested to resign from his responsibilities, originally to express that when he took office, it was to resolve the difficulties in North China. Now that the situation in North China is gradually resolved, he requested the Central Government to retire. After repeated persuasion from the Central Government, and a personal urging from Vice Minister Tang, Huang, feeling deeply moved by the Central Government's urging, did not firmly decline. It is now heard that pending President Wang's scheduled trip to Lushan, Huang will also go to Lushan to meet Chiang and Wang in person, seek instructions on everything, and then proceed to North China to preside over political affairs. (3) The takeover of the North China war zone has been largely negotiated completely. After I go north, I will meet again with Shibayama, the representative of the Kwantung Army, in Peiping, but there will be no important negotiations, only ongoing contact. As for the date of the takeover, the north's commercial transport is difficult and preparations are inconvenient due to the heavy flooding in the Malanyu, Jixian, and Zunhua areas. Therefore, the takeover will take place once the flood has subsided slightly. (4) After I go north, I will immediately plan to implement all the points decided at the Dalian Conference. From now on, for local North China negotiation incidents, Yue Kaixian, the special commissioner, will be responsible for the Chahar area, and Tao Shangming, the administrative commissioner, will be responsible for the Yuguan area, proceeding in accordance with the intentions of the Central Government and the Political Affairs Committee. (5) Preparations for setting up checkpoints at Chengkou are already in place. All tax regulations will be handled according to the import tax regulations promulgated by the Central Government. The reports in the newspapers a few days ago about separately formulated tax regulations are completely inaccurate. Yin concluded by saying that it is not yet determined whether he will go to Lushan. Everything will be decided after meeting with President Wang. As for the seven matters discussed in Dalian and the subsequent measures: (1) Regarding the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants in the demilitarized zone, the report that residency permits will be issued by the Japanese side is not reliable. If relations are to improve, the other party must first effectively crack down on the Japanese and Korean vagrants. The other party has solemnly indicated that it accepts the suggestions made by our side. (2) Our newly organized security forces will enter the demilitarized zone. The Hebei provincial government is now ready, and the number of personnel has been decided at 9,000. (3) Regarding the takeover of Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs, for the former, the other party's garrison will withdraw immediately upon the arrival of our security forces. For the latter, for the sake of prudence, it has been decided to form a committee, and the candidates have also been internally determined. (4) The withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops stationed in the demilitarized zone is a matter of course. This is stipulated by the Tanggu Truce. The reason why it has been delayed in the past is that our security forces had not yet been dispatched. (5) When reorganizing Chahar East, we should first recover Duolun, and other parts must also be reorganized. (6) The crackdown on the Datong Company is not because it sells drugs. Because the company issued "identity certificates" at Shanhaiguan, Qingdao, and Yantai to Chinese laborers leaving the country. During the Qing Dynasty, the four northeastern provinces were forbidden lands, and the population was only seven or eight million. After the Republic, residents of Hebei and Shandong went to the Northeast to make a living, and the population increased to 27 million. In the past, these immigrants often went every year in the spring, either individually or with their families, called "going to Guandong," with the same meaning as the Fujianese going to Nanyang to make a living. On average, about one million people left the country each year. By late autumn and early winter, they returned to their hometowns, and statistics showed that only half of them returned. The rest had settled down. The other party's Datong Company still has offices in three locations, issuing so-called "identity certificates." This is inappropriate. We have asked the other party to crack down on it. Various Chinese and foreign newspapers rumored about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and postal communication in North China. I dare to responsibly inform you that there is absolutely no such event, because it has never been mentioned at all. How could it be brought to the government? The Dalian Conference was proposed by our side, and the location was also decided by our side. According to diplomatic convention, the other party would never incidentally request or carry any matter. However, examining the source of this news, Chinese newspapers mostly adopted records from foreign newspapers, which is obviously a kind of news policy, without any doubt. I hope that our journalistic community will pay special attention in the future to avoid being used by them. Often, when an event occurs, the other party initially has no such motivation. After the event, once the news is probed, if the parties do not express opposition, they take the opportunity to demand it. This kind of situation is regrettable. The abolition of the Tanggu Truce has not been mentioned. The first step is to wait for the aforementioned seven items to be resolved before discussing this matter. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that Huang Fu recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang summoning him to Lushan. Huang telegraphed Beijing, saying that he planned to go down the mountain around the 10th, come to Beijing, transfer to Lushan, meet with Chairman Chiang, and after seeking instructions, immediately return to North China to resume his duties. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong left Moganshan at 7:30 AM on the 6th, arrived in Beijing by car at 3 PM, and decided to visit Tang Youren on the 7th. If Gu Mengyu returns to Beijing within a few days, he also plans to pay a visit. After staying in Beijing for three to five days, he will return to Tianjin. Yin informed the Central News Agency reporter in writing that when I came to Beijing from Moganshan today, many reporters were kind enough to come and ask to publish a statement. I have told them all the circumstances. I have already issued a general statement when I returned to Shanghai from Dalian. There are no new facts happening now, so there is nothing to tell. Moreover, my job is to follow the orders of my superiors, to run errands and use my tongue. In principle, without permission, there is absolutely no possibility of free speech. In addition, foreign affairs must not be announced casually. Therefore, every time I pass through here, I have never been able to talk to you to the fullest extent. Unexpectedly, I have not been understood by my colleagues, and I have been regarded as a mysterious action. Therefore, I cannot help but speculate and misunderstand, and because of misunderstanding, I speculate even more. The results are completely untrue. This is not only related to the credibility of various newspapers, but I personally also feel very difficult. To cite a simple example, such as the recent Shanghai newspapers competing to report that I lost two suitcases when I returned to Shanghai from Dalian, and also said that I was carrying more than twenty pieces of luggage. In fact, when I go out, I only take a servant and a small handbag. Another newspaper reported that I said that Wang Kemin borrowed money in Shanghai to relieve the war zone, etc. Mr. Wang sent a letter to inquire, and I only then realized. Such trivial matters can still be misreported in this way, so I am even more afraid to lightly utter a word about national foreign affairs. I hope to be forgiven, etc. According to Yin, Chairman Huang has agreed to go north after being urged by various parties. Because Chairman Chiang invited him to Lushan, he plans to visit first before returning north. However, the date of departure has not been determined. Approximately after President Wang goes to Lushan, Huang will go down the mountain to Lushan to meet Chiang and Wang to discuss everything, and then go to Peiping. (Central News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Duan Rugeng said that after Shibayama returned to Peiping from Dalian last month, they agreed to go to inspect the handover of the Eastern Tombs together. I later suffered from a slight illness, and also because roads in various places were destroyed by floods, I could not go. Because the provincial government has no instructions on the reorganization of the Eastern Tombs Management Committee, and the establishment of checkpoints on the Great Wall and the joint anti-smuggling matters of the security forces must be reported to the provincial government for instructions, I have decided to leave Peiping for Tianjin today or tomorrow to visit Yu and ask for instructions on the direction of progress. The exchange of defenses for the war zone security forces and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various passes of the Great Wall will only have considerable progress after Chairman Huang returns to North China. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) In eastern Luan, farmers in several counties have been rented by Japanese and Korean vagrants to grow opium poppies. The county magistrate has investigated and reported to the province, and the provincial government will submit a report to the committee for negotiation when resolving the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants.

Wang decided to host Hu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 6th. It is heard that after Hu attended the banquet, he returned to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 6th and is scheduled to set sail on the 9th to return to his post. (Central News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Shize, the minister to Switzerland, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th. At 4 PM, accompanied by Vice Minister Xu Mo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he went to the official residence No. 1 of the Ministry of Railways to visit Wang. Vice Minister Tang was also present.

<h3>British and Japanese Troops Stop Exercises</h3>
<p>The Surface Situation Gradually Tends to Ease</p>
<p>Japanese Chief of Staff Explains to British Envoy Cadogan</p>
<p>(Peiping) A person from Yuguan said that on the 1st of this month, the British troops stationed in Nanhai conducted exercises in the Erlangmiao area. The Japanese intelligence team sent a staff officer to the British military headquarters to negotiate, saying that Erlangmiao belonged to the territory of "Manchukuo" and that foreign troops must notify in advance of the exercises to avoid misunderstandings. The British military commander said that the annual exercises were based on the Boxer Protocol and that there was no need to notify the Japanese side. Therefore, the exercises continued as usual, and no specific answer was given to the Japanese military. Starting on the 2nd, the Japanese troops also began exercises in the area of the four forts. For a time, artillery fire rumbled, and neither side showed weakness. There was a state of confrontation, and the situation was tense. Fortunately, no conflict occurred. The Japanese soldiers stopped the exercises yesterday. Wakafuji, the chief of staff specially dispatched by the 14th Hirata Brigade stationed in Yuguan, went to Beidaihe to meet with British Envoy to China Cadogan to explain everything. The storm has subsided. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The British and Japanese incident in Yuguan is still under secret alert on both sides, but the surface situation has eased and exercises have been stopped.

<p>Counties in the War Zone</p>
<h3>Plan to Reorganize Transportation</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Transportation in various counties in the war zone has been difficult to travel for many years due to lack of repair. The Jiji-Mi District Office and the Luan-Yu District Office sent representatives to Peiping on the 11th of this month to discuss the entire plan for reorganizing transportation in the war zone. The first step is to build trunk roads, including (1) Tongxian via Sanhe Bangjun Yutian Fengrun Lulong Funing to Yuguan, (2) Bangjun via Jixian Shimen Zunhua to Xifengkou, (3) Malanyu via Shimen Yutian to Tianjin, (4) Yutian to Tangshan, (5) Yuguan via Leting to Tianjin (6) Zunhua via Fengrun to Tangshan, (7) Peiping via Huairou Miyun to Gubeikou, (8) Ningyun via Shunyi to Tongxian and other eight main lines, followed by branch roads and bridge construction projects.

After careful research, the Jiji-Mi and Luan-Yu districts will send commissioners to inspect various places, and at the same time request the Central Government to allocate funds. When the entire transportation reorganization is completed, the second step is to purchase charcoal cars for transportation and passenger transport. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Central Government and National Government</p>
<h3>Reports on Two Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Tang Youren: Self-Defense and Economic Power</p>
<p>Chen Lifu: Education and Water Conservancy Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 142nd Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th. Members of the Central Committee Wang Zhaoming, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Tang Youren, and all staff members, about 500 people in total, attended. Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting, and Tang Youren reported on "Self-Defense and Economic Power," stating that all creatures in the universe have self-defense and reproductive powers to ensure their survival. The same is true for countries and nations. The so-called self-defense power is used to resist external violence, and the so-called reproductive power is economic power, which is used to develop national wealth. However, there must first be rich economic power before there can be strong self-defense power. The adequacy of national military preparations depends on the fullness of the national treasury. Whether the national treasury is full depends on the income of people's taxes. The source of taxes depends on the people's productivity. Therefore, the strength of a country's self-defense power is still determined by the strength of its economic power. Therefore, to save the country, we must start by enriching economic power. We should base our actions on economic principles and strive to make the national productivity greater than the consumption power. We can emulate the planned economy of Soviet Russia and the industrial rationalization of Japan, but at present, we should improve and maintain existing industries to make them suitable for social needs. As for foreign affairs, we should strive for trade balance with the League of Nations. In particular, we should discuss with friendly countries to offset the import surplus with goods or accounting methods. To extend this, there are natural ways to improve domestic production. If the economic power is not worried about not being rich, the self-defense power will also gradually increase. The meeting adjourned at 9 AM after the speech. (Central News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th. Chen Lifu, Wang Yongbin, Chen Qicai, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Xiang, Wei Huai, etc., and staff members of various yuan, ministries, and committees, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chen Lifu presided over the meeting, led the ceremony, and reported on China's education and water conservancy issues, stating that China's education is currently aimless and does not meet the needs of society. Moreover, due to lax management, it has become a phenomenon where the family, school, and society are not concerned. In the future, how to study and improve the management methods is an important issue. The teaching materials should also be adapted to the social environment. We hope that the people of the whole country will help the education administration authorities to achieve the goal of education improvement. Regarding water conservancy, the Yellow River has become an incurable disease. In addition, the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River are all extremely silted. When Chinese people talk about water conservancy, they ignore local manpower. In the past, Xiaoxian used local manpower for a year and a half and spent 7,000 yuan to build a river. From this, it can be seen that the fundamental need to focus on the local aspect of water conservancy issues. If local manpower is ignored, it is like abandoning the root and seeking the branch.

<p>Since Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated, all of Europe has been shaken. Italy has even stationed troops on the border in preparation for any eventuality. If the German authorities act with even the slightest imprudence, a major crisis in Europe could easily be triggered. Therefore, at that time, various countries were paying close attention to how Hitler would deal with this issue. Now that the Guangdong incident has just subsided, German President Hindenburg has died of old age and illness. The German cabinet has changed the constitution, concentrating the powers of the president and prime minister in Hitler's person. Therefore, Hitler's position is even more important. Every word and action has an increasingly significant impact. And the great powers related to Germany will be increasingly concerned about the development of the future German political situation. This is something that is inevitable given the situation. Yesterday, Reuters reported from London that "Russia's relationship with Germany is still uncertain, so it is quite worried about future developments. Britain is also concerned about the situation in Germany. Other small countries are also the same. The general impression is that this winter will subject Hitler to a very great trial, and its success or failure will be determined by economic problems." We see the difficulties of Hitler's current position, and Reuters' words do indeed have a value for assessment.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation within Germany, foreign trade is declining day by day, and the economic situation has not improved. Although it loudly advocates the theory of equality in armaments in the international community, given the exhaustion of financial resources, even if it obtains the right to equality, it is still difficult to expect it to be put into practice. Moreover, the middle-class elements who formerly supported the National Socialist Party are now gradually harboring resentment due to disappointment. Therefore, although Hitler's faction is doing its best to propagate how stable the interior is, the signs of its wavering are indeed impossible to conceal. As for the diplomatic aspect, the most dangerous thing in the eyes of the world today is the issue of the German-Austrian merger. Austria's position is between Germany and Italy, and it is also a buffer zone for the Little Entente countries against Germany. Once Austria's independence is abolished, the peaceful situation under the Versailles system will inevitably be shaken, and the balance of European countries will inevitably be broken. This is not only something that Italy will not allow, but also something that France and other small countries will find extremely difficult to tolerate. However, the National Socialist Party has never forgotten this. Even if the Austrian incident was not instigated or presided over by Hitler, at the very least it can be seen that he has always sympathized with and promoted the National Socialist Party. Once the uprising failed, Hitler, in order to express his intentions, arrested all the party members who had fled to Germany after the incident. First, he lost the sympathy of the Austrians and strengthened their determination to resist Germany's independence. Then, he aroused the suspicion of his subordinates and reduced the sincerity of their faith in the leader. Therefore, if Hitler does not have great and unique new aspirations in the future, I am afraid that he will not be able to solve the economic difficulties internally, nor will he be able to fight against the great powers externally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the relationship between Germany and Britain and France, Britain's foreign policy, although superficially seems to be close to supporting Germany and suppressing France, and has a tendency to not want to see one country become too strong in Europe, it will never be willing to harm its own interests for the sake of helping Germany. Moreover, it is unwilling to promote the suspicion of destroying peace under this tense European situation. Britain's advocacy is to maintain the status quo. After the assassination of the Austrian Chancellor, Britain has deeply feared that Europe will have more troubles from now on. How can it not pay more attention to how Hitler, who has assumed the position of head of state and increased his power, will exert his skills in the future? As for France and Germany, there is a fundamental conflict between them. From the beginning of Hitler's administration, France has been monitoring him step by step. At the same time, it has also worked hard to promote peaceful relations among the Eastern European countries, using the importance of the Soviet Union's position and concluding friendly relations with it. Once all the arrangements are in place, Germany will not be able to cross Poland to invade Ukraine and Belarus in the east, nor will it be able to break through Austria to offend Italy in the south, nor will it be able to cross the Rhine to recover the two provinces of Alsace-Lorraine in the west. In our observation, Hitler can only swallow his anger at this time and abide by the scope of the Treaty of Versailles. Otherwise, what method will he use to break through this difficult situation?</p>
<p>Moreover, since the Austrian coup, Italy's attempt to maintain Austria's independence has become even more vigorous. In addition to wooing France and the Little Entente countries to establish a foundation of security, it is also supporting the establishment of a new Austrian government and restricting the extension of German power. Now, Mr. Schuschnigg, who succeeded Dollfuss, although his prestige is not as good as Dollfuss', he is also a politician with great skills. The National Guard is the strongest military force in Austria, and it is quite loyal in upholding independence. Moreover, the Catholic Church and the Jewish people in Austria still have strong forces. After this incident, the feelings of all Austrians towards the German Socialist Party were greatly damaged, and they made every effort to prevent the activities of the Germans. In addition, all the major European powers are also focusing their attention on Austrian affairs, watching how Hitler will respond. Therefore, will Hitler's response be radical or moderate? Will he stick to his original policy? Or will he have a special new policy? At the beginning of his assumption of the position of head of state, it is indeed the time for Hitler's final trial.</p>
<p>Concrete Measures for Japanese Research</p>
<h3>Demand for Naval Autonomy</h3>
<p>Question of Whether to Abolish the Washington Treaty</p>
<p>Disagreement Between Naval and Foreign Affairs Opinions</p>
<p>Saito to Attend Naval Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government intends to decide on concrete policies for the London Preparatory Naval Conference to be held in October of this year. The naval authorities are currently considering the same. The government's policy has consistently opposed the proportional system and advocated that countries determine appropriate numbers based on the principle of total tonnage and recognize that countries are free to choose and build various warships. If the outcome of the conference is able to establish a fair treaty, the Japanese Navy will not oppose reducing its current level of armaments. The fundamental issue is the autonomy of armaments, and the greatest purpose of Japan's policy is to realize this autonomy. As for the question of whether to declare the abolition of the Washington Treaty this year, the opinions of the Navy Ministry and the Foreign Ministry have not been able to reach an agreement and must be resolved in the future. (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is expected that next year's naval disarmament conference will involve political issues in the Far East and issues such as mandated rule. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada is now carefully considering the suitability of the chief plenipotentiary for the conference. However, from all points of view, it is believed that former Prime Minister Saito is the most suitable, and the support from senior statesmen and elders is also stronger. Therefore, in order to break through the difficult situation, it is planned to earnestly request that Viscount Saito must come forward. Therefore, there is a possibility of realization.

<p>(Moscow) The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party issued a notice to General Galen and his subordinates to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Red Army's Far Eastern Force. The force had previously received the Red Banner Award. The Central Committee's order stated that it deeply believes that the power of the Far Eastern Force in the Guang'an case has been thoroughly understood by the enemy and will certainly continue to be the cornerstone of the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border and the axis of the peace movement. At the same time, Soviet newspapers also published the speech of Voroshilov, Chairman of the People's Commissariat for Defense, at the celebration, strongly advocating the Soviet government's resolute struggle for the peace movement, and declaring that we are strengthening the strength of the Red Army, because the Red Army is the cornerstone of world peace, etc. (5th Tass)</p>

<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3>Considers Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>Claims That Weak Strategies Have Failed</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported on the 4th that the Soviet Union has repeatedly taken unfriendly actions towards Japan, and Japan will issue a serious warning. Foreign journalists today inquired about this statement with the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who replied that although the Nichi Nichi Shimbun has instructed the government to do so, the government has not yet taken this action. This statement is quite humorous, but it continued that the Japanese government is now seriously considering this matter. Japan's policy towards Russia has been a complete failure. This is the general impression. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently been criticized for adopting a weak policy towards Russia. The warning mentioned in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun is merely representative of public opinion. (6th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Today, train No. 92 from Harbin to Khabarovsk derailed and overturned due to the tracks being destroyed by the Yi Army between Liu Dao Hezi and Shitou East. The number of train derailments between them has reached seven so far. (6th Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Ambassador Hishikari stationed in Manchuria that incidents hindering train operations have occurred successively on the East Line recently. The following four incidents occurred within the past week:</p>
<p>(1) On July 25, cargo train No. 925 heading east was bombed by the Yi Army near Shamouaer, destroying six carriages, all of which were overturned.</p>
<p>(2) On July 28, train No. 3 heading west had its tracks destroyed near Ukimiho, causing the train to overturn. Several passengers were injured, but fortunately no one died.</p>
<p>(3) On July 31, train No. 915 suddenly derailed between Liu Dao Hezi and Gaolingzi. (4) On August 2, train No. 52 had its tracks destroyed in the Weisha River area. The explosion of the bomb completely burned five carriages and smashed two carriages to pieces. Four Manchurian police officers were killed, two were seriously injured, and the whereabouts of eight others are unknown.</p>
<p>Regarding the inside story of the above-mentioned train bombing case, there seems to be some organized conspiracy involved. "Manchukuo" officials are currently conducting a serious investigation. (6th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<h3>Reform Plan for Manchukuo Organizations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Nagata, Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, visited Vice-Minister Pingkami of the Colonial Affairs Ministry on the 4th to present and explain the Army Minister's plan to reform the organizations in Manchukuo. Today, he will visit Vice-Minister Shigemitsu of the Foreign Ministry to provide the same explanation. The contents of the plan are as follows: First, the basic policy: (1) Respect the independence of Manchukuo and promote its rapid development. The reform of the organizations in Manchukuo cannot become colonial. (2) According to what is clearly stated in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is inseparable. Therefore, the relationship between the Empire and Manchukuo is different from the relationship between the Empire and other independent countries. (3) The policy towards Manchukuo is an important national policy of the Empire and cannot be monopolized by one department. Second, reform the organizations in Manchukuo: (1) The Chokunin-rank Governor-General of the Kwantung Leased Territory is the governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory and is placed under the command of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary. (2) The Ambassador Plenipotentiary, because of the special relationship between the two countries, is not a pure diplomat. Except for diplomatic issues, before the extraterritoriality is abolished, the police affairs, special companies such as the South Manchuria Railway, and the supervision and control of the Japanese in Manchukuo are all under his jurisdiction. (3) Manchukuo is an independent country, so guidance is not exercised over it. (4) From the perspective of the actual situation of Manchukuo's security and the joint defense of Japan and Manchukuo, the Ambassador Plenipotentiary concurrently serves as the Commander of the Kwantung Army. (5) In order to materialize the spirit of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the Commander of the Kwantung Army maintains the current relationship with Manchukuo. (6) Conclude treaties such as the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Alliance. (7) In order to implement this treaty, a Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference is established on a regular basis. The results of the negotiations are reported to the governments of both countries for implementation. (8) The Kwantung Army Special Service Department and other organizations merge with the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference. (9) The embassy's police affairs agencies and the Kwantung Military Police are placed under the command of the Commander of the Kwantung Military Police. (10) After the Kwantung Leased Territory is abolished, a new agency at the counselor level is established in the embassy to manage the supervision of special companies in Manchukuo under the jurisdiction of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary. Third, the reform of the internal affairs agencies: (1) Regarding the Commander of the Army's national defense military affairs, the German Parliament convenes.</p>
<h3>Commemorating President Hindenburg</h3>
<p>Hitler Praises the Hero of Tannenberg</p>
<p>But Not a Word About the Current Situation</p>
<p>(Berlin) At exactly 12 noon today, the Diet convened in the Kroll Opera House. The crowd was extremely crowded. Speaker Goering stood up and declared in his clear and sorrowful tone, "I now announce the opening of the meeting to commemorate the late President Hindenburg. I ask everyone to stand in silence to express our condolences." After the speech, the Diet was silent for one minute. (6th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prime Minister Hitler gave a speech in the Diet today to commemorate the hero of Tannenberg, praising the late President Hindenburg. Hitler's speech lasted from 12:10 p.m. to 12:25 p.m., detailing Hindenburg's achievements, saying that the late President's fame would be forever immortalized in German history. Hitler also read out the official report of the Battle of Tannenberg, calling the Battle of Tannenberg the greatest war in history. This great achievement will be passed down forever along with this great fame. He also said that if our politics can keep pace with our country's military affairs, Germany will not fear foreign aggression. Marshal Hindenburg is the one who turned Germany from danger to safety. (6th National Electric)</p>
<p>(Berlin) At noon today, the crowd in front of the Berlin Church was rarely seen. The church doors had to be temporarily closed until 1:30 p.m., and then the Chief Pastor Dr. Mueller led a memorial prayer for the late President Hindenburg. (5th National Electric)</p>
<p>2,000 People in the Diet</p>
<h3>Listen to Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>The Deposed Crown Prince Arrived the Earliest</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Corps Box Was Completely Full</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German House of Representatives convened in the Kroll Theater today. The new President and Prime Minister Hitler attended the meeting and gave a speech praising the late President Hindenburg's great achievements. 2,000 people listened, and the deposed Crown Prince was also among them. The deposed Crown Prince arrived quite early. Defense Minister General von Blomberg warmly welcomed him. All the cabinet members attended the meeting. Many cabinet members and all the members of the Diet wore brown shirts. The diplomatic corps box was completely full. Hitler wore a brown uniform, with a black gauze tied around his arm. He stood next to Hindenburg's son, Colonel Hindenburg, and spoke. Unexpectedly, Hitler did not say a word about the current political situation and the position of president. His speech only lasted 15 minutes, praising the late President's war achievements in the Prussian-Austrian War and the Franco-Prussian War, and his service in the army during peacetime. He then said that Hindenburg retired to his hometown in 1911. Later, the former Emperor appointed him to command the eastern border and defeat the Russian army, thus saving Germany from destruction. It was not until then that Marshal Hindenburg's fame was heard all over the world. A catchphrase in Hitler's speech was: "Marshal Hindenburg is not dead. He is still with us. Marshal Hindenburg's name has become a symbol of the indestructible and forever vigorous spirit of the German people. The name of the President is inseparable from the name of the late Marshal. The greatest battle in historical boundaries is linked to the name of the late President Hindenburg and is inseparable. He served as the commander of the German army and saved the country from destruction. If our political leaders at that time had talents comparable to those of Hindenburg, then Germany could have avoided the deepest shame in history." Before Hitler spoke, a hundred musicians played Beethoven's Coriolanus Overture, which was broadcast by wireless radio to various parts of Germany and Italy, the United States, Japan, and other countries. After Hitler's speech, the band played a dirge again. After the meeting was dismissed, soldiers of the National Defense Army, the Black Shirt Guard of the National Socialist Party, the Guard of the Prussian Prime Minister General Goering, and the police all wore steel helmets and carried rifles with bayonets, and marched in formation through the Kroll Theater, saluting President Hitler, General Goering, and General von Blomberg. The deposed Crown Prince, wearing a military uniform, walked proudly, smiling to the crowd and left the hospital after shaking hands with the police, workers, and a girl in the crowd. He finally got into a blue sports car with a smile and drove away.</p>
<p>Today, the Kroll Theater was hung with black curtains and holly wreaths, decorated with white lotuses. Opposite the podium was a huge half-length statue of the late President, surrounded by flowers. Today, the authorities were extremely vigilant and had roped off the lamp posts to prevent the public from approaching the venue. Special wooden railings were also set up. On the road from the Prime Minister's Office to the Kroll Theater, armed guards stood shoulder to shoulder. Members of the National Socialist Party's Black Shirt Team held pistols and daggers, and mounted patrols held blades to prevent accidents. When President Hitler was about to leave the Prime Minister's Office to go to the Kroll Theater, there were two rows of police, standing on the left and right sides, and regarding the pure diplomatic issues of the Ambassador Plenipotentiary, his command and supervision, although still maintained as before, the command and supervision of general matters are governed by the Prime Minister. The ministers of various provinces participate in it. (2) A large organization composed of officials from the military and civilian ministries is newly established in the cabinet as an auxiliary agency for the Prime Minister on the Manchukuo issue. Also, the Army Ministry's plan for the Colonial Affairs Ministry is that it is too colonial and hinders the independence of Manchukuo. The Foreign Ministry's plan is considered to treat Manchukuo the same as a general independent country, which is also unacceptable, so it expressed opposition to both. (6th Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>Facing the crowd, several detachments of the National Defense Army were stationed at the Kroll Theater to guard it closely. The public was not allowed to walk within 200 yards of the theater, and even Hitler's followers were under close surveillance.</p>

<h3>Reached a Compromise with the National Defense Army</h3>
<p>The Whole Story as Published by French Newspapers</p>
<p>Germany Expresses Its Willingness to Repair Relations with France</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Paris Soir reported a telegraph from a correspondent in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, detailing the circumstances of Chancellor Hitler's assumption of the presidency, saying that Hitler initially did not want to consult the leaders of the National Defense Army and directly assumed the presidency, but finally signed a "easily stimulated covenant" with them. On the night of July 30, Hitler held a secret meeting, attended by Prussian Prime Minister and Aviation Minister General Goering, Interior Minister Dr. Frick, new leader of the Brown Shirts Rutz, and Director General of Secret Police and Leader of the Black Shirts Himmler. It was decided to resolve the issue of the late President Hindenburg's position on his own. General Goering declared that according to the police authorities, the report on President Hindenburg's political views suggested that a member of the Hohenzollern royal family succeed as president. This report has been secretly sent to Doorn. He dared to decide that President's old friend General Calus卓 must have a copy. Hitler then said that he knew how to keep Gar氏 silent. So he drafted a plan to maintain national order, making the Brown Shirts prepare everything, so that if there was any warning, they would come out to contain it. On August 1, the Prime Minister met with Chief of Staff of the National Defense Army Admiral von Fritsch, Defense Minister General von Blomberg, and General Richie诺 of the ministry, and explained to him that he was allowed to serve as head of state in order to recover from the civil war, made a guarantee stating that he would not use his position to discriminate against the National Defense Army, and Hitler also undertook to weaken the trends of National Socialism and adopt the National Defense Army's suggestions on domestic and foreign policy issues.

<p>(Paris) The Petit Parisien published a conversation with German Deputy Leader Hess on Sunday, saying that Germany is prepared to reach an agreement with France, and that Hitler's government can certainly represent the masses more than some leaders of the French parliament.

<h3>Would Austria Restore the Monarchy?</h3>
<p>Reportedly, Acceptance has Been Expressed</p>
<p>Small Agreements Not Insisted Upon</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to Berlin newspapers and other important publications citing Paris dispatches, the restoration of the Austrian monarchy has become an important issue for rapid international consultations and secret agreements. Reliable sources indicate that Austrian monarchists recently held an important meeting at the Habsburg imperial family's exiled residence, Stunoksel Villa, in Belgium. Attendees included the deposed Empress Zita and Archduke Otto. Various matters related to the restoration were discussed in detail at that time, so that Archduke Otto's declaration of the imperial throne could become a reality as soon as possible. Another report states that the French government has recently expressed acceptance of the restoration of the Austrian imperial family. Diplomatic negotiations are underway in Rome, Prague, London, and Belgrade. It is also reported that Yugoslavia and Romania have expressed their adherence in principle to the majority view, but the Czech Republic still opposes this plan. The two major conditions for the Habsburg imperial family's return to the throne are: first, the imperial family must continue to recognize the Treaty of Saint-Germain; and second, Archduke Otto must marry an Italian princess as his empress.

<h3>Sweden's Neutral Policy</h3>
<p>According to communist sources in the Swedish capital, German Defense Minister Blomberg recently visited the Swedish capital for a private tour and held secret talks with the Swedish government. Swedish Defense Minister Per Albin Hansson recently gave a speech clarifying that this statement is inaccurate, stating that General Blomberg did not go to the Swedish Ministry of Defense, nor did he meet with the Defense Minister. The Defense Minister has never considered inviting Blomberg to visit Sweden's defense arrangements. This matter must be clarified because the Swedish government's defense policy is solely for safeguarding peace and has no other purpose. This is the case now, and it will continue to be so in the future. As for forming alliances with other countries, this is not permitted within the scope of this policy, including forming alliances with countries along the Baltic Sea. The Social Democratic government does not want to hear about the policy of rearmament, but neither does it want a democratic Sweden to eliminate its strong defense tradition and the possibility of freedom.

<h3>Soviet Russia Deceives Travelers</h3>
<p>Riga Russian modern novelist and poet Ilya Ehrenburg recently formally stated to the Moscow authorities that the Russian travel agency provides foreign tourists visiting Russia with false and insincere hospitality, placing them in specially designated hotels and serving them with trained waiters, putting them in an atmosphere of prosperity and splendor. The purpose is to make tourists take away a good impression of the living conditions in Soviet Russia. The hotels have abundant food and drink, music, and dancing, with everything provided. As for the hunger, cold, and suffering of the people, which are the common experiences of the majority of people in Russia, they fear that foreign guests will see it. In fact, the good aspects of Soviet Russia should indeed be shown to people, but the bad aspects, such as the lack of food, the emptiness of the stores, the ragged clothing of the people, and the cruelty of people towards each other, cannot be concealed. Ehrenburg's writings are most famous in Germany, and his poems and essays have been translated into German. His writing is profound and sharp, and he is said to be a master of short essays.

<h3>Soviet Collective Livestock Farms</h3>
<p>(Moscow TASS News Agency, July 3) Since their collectivization at the same time as collective farms, Soviet livestock farms have occupied an important position in Soviet livestock husbandry. In total, there are 132,000 districts. The number of water buffalo raised in these districts was 5,400,000 in 1931, increasing to 6,400,000 this year. The number of pigs raised has increased from 2,100,000 in 1932 to 2,900,000 this year. Other livestock, such as flocks of sheep, have almost increased fivefold in the past two years. Collective livestock farms supply large numbers of livestock to collective farmers. In 1933, they obtained 170,000 calves (no fewer than 1,500,000 this year), 860,000 pigs (no fewer than 300,000 this year), and 100,000 lambs (no fewer than 500,000 this year). The Soviet Union is currently engaged in organizational work to improve livestock husbandry. Collective farms now have 1,935,000 calves, 45,000 piglets, and 125,000 sheep, and this year will continue to increase. Collective farms have made pioneering contributions to improving livestock conditions, establishing new-style pastures, and applying scientific methods. This year, the Soviet Union will also construct new-style pastures at a cost of over 400 million rubles.</p>

Today's people are no longer what they used to be and are all able to understand public welfare undertakings such as developing electricity, improving waterways, preventing floods and droughts, preventing forest fires, and balancing agriculture and industry. The government intends to develop industry in the West. In the past, the West overly emphasized agriculture and considered it sufficient to purchase industrial products from the East. The East has never paid much attention to agriculture. I know that the East and West are interdependent, but the country must think of the whole and not be regarded as a pile of loose sand."

<p>(Washington) Since Roosevelt took office as President last March, he has been engaged in reversing the misfortune of the economic panic. Statistics released today by the Federal Reserve and the Department of Commerce are sufficient to prove that the President's efforts have made significant progress. The number of unemployed workers who have returned to work from the last month of Hoover's presidency to today has increased by 35%. Since the implementation of the New Deal, foreign trade has increased by 55%, and prices have increased by 23% due to the devaluation of the dollar and the restriction of agricultural production. The gradual recovery of industry and commerce can also be seen in the income of the railways. The income of the railways has increased by 31% compared to March 1933. The construction industry has increased by 85%, department store business has increased by 26%, and public confidence in national banks has been restored, which can be confirmed by the officially announced bank deposits. Since President Roosevelt ordered all banks to close a year ago and only allowed a few banks with excellent credit to reopen, bank deposits have increased by 25% to this day.

<h3>The Panchen Lama Will Soon Leave Beiping</h3>

<p>Chiang Instructs Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<h3>To Properly Draft Disaster Prevention Plans</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek of Guling recently telegraphed the chairmen of the provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, saying: "The way to provide disaster relief depends on early prevention at ordinary times and well-thought-out remediation in emergencies. Therefore, in ancient times, three years of cultivation were sure to have one year's worth of food. And in recent years, I have repeatedly ordered the provinces to prepare grain storage and urged the provinces to promote rural cooperation, etc. The meaning is in this. Since this year, floods and droughts have occurred repeatedly, and the disaster area is wide, extending to several provinces. To find out the reason, it is really because the provincial authorities lack defensive measures, so that when there is a drought, there is no irrigation, and when there is a flood, there is no way to divert it. They sit and watch the disaster become a reality, and they only know how to panic and shout. When they review their duties, do they have no guilt? It is like the situation in the provinces along the Yangtze River since the summer of this year. There has been little rainfall, and the fields are dry. Although this is a disaster, if you study carefully and adapt to local conditions, it is not difficult to draw water to relieve the emergency in areas where rivers and streams crisscross. In high-lying areas near mountains, it is also advisable to plan for drought-resistant crops to improve the situation. At the same time, we should make great efforts in adjusting rural food supplies, financial relief, and all matters related to disaster prevention. We may not have exhausted our means. However, the provincial authorities have not heard of putting their heart and soul into this, but they only use broad and general words to report disasters and famine, or even exaggerate the reports in the newspapers, hoping to make a sensation and prepare the way to request funds and raise relief funds. As for the actual situation, whether the disaster situation in their area is really as reported, how much damage has been suffered, and whether it has reached a point where there is nothing that can be done and it cannot be salvaged, I am afraid that even the disaster-reporting officials may not fully understand the details. In this situation, it is only possible to make preparations and is only a laughingstock of society. Speaking of this, I am really moved. Now, for the sake of thinking about troubles and preventing them, learning from the past and preventing future occurrences, all disaster prevention plans for the coming year in your province should be carefully designed by the provincial government according to what it can do, and specific measures and budget estimates should be drafted in detail. Those that should be carried out but cannot be borne by the province's human and financial resources, and those that require a longer period of time to complete, should also be drafted in a three-year or five-year plan, with a budget determined, and submitted to this headquarters before October 1 of this year for verification. In addition, public agricultural fields and cooperative undertakings that are beneficial to disaster prevention should be promoted and appropriately rewarded, and the Kangji Record, which was re-printed and distributed by this headquarters last year, contains many methods for preventing and relieving disasters and curing the root and the symptoms of the disease throughout the generations, which are sufficient for today's reference and borrowing. It can also be studied in detail and adopted with reference to the actual situation. It is necessary to ensure that disaster prevention facilities, the government guides from above, and the people work hard from below, so that the effect is more significant, and there will be no worries about digging a well when you are thirsty. In the future, when the provinces report disasters, they must also wait for a thorough investigation to confirm the situation and the estimated amount of crop failure, and report the details truthfully. Do not exaggerate or lie, and do not issue public documents or publish them in the newspapers, so as to avoid being impractical. In addition to separate telegrams and other orders, all must be complied with as required." (Sixth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Disaster Area in Hubei Province Expands</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Snatch Food, Flee, and Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Ten Gentlemen Request 5 Million Yuan for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. After the major flood in Hubei Province, it was followed by severe drought. The disaster-stricken area has already reached forty counties, and the number of affected people is no less than ten million. To this day, it has not rained for many days, causing the disaster area to expand day by day, and the number of disaster victims to increase. Robbing food, fleeing, and committing suicide are happening everywhere. The problem is serious, even more so than the flood in the twentieth year of the Republic. In addition to resolutely stopping the construction of new government offices and transferring 500,000 yuan of construction funds to provide relief, the provincial government has repeatedly appealed to all parties, at least to raise 2 million yuan for relief funds, so that emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief can be carried out in sequence. On the 4th, the Provincial Relief Committee convened a meeting of gentry from all over the province, raising four questions: (1) How to determine the method of raising relief funds; (2) How to raise relief funds; (3) How to distribute relief funds after raising them; (4) What kind of seeds should be tested so that they are suitable for the land in each county and can be replanted. The opinions of the gentry can be summarized into seven points: (1) Determine the amount of disaster relief to be 5 million yuan; (2) Issue disaster relief bonds and disaster relief lottery tickets; (3) Expand disaster relief publicity and issue disaster relief reward and punishment regulations; (4) Use the 370,000 yuan of savings under the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Fund for emergency relief; (5) Request the Rural Financial Relief Office of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank to find ways to provide relief to rural areas in various counties; (6) Open up stockpiled grain; (7) Exempt the mu tax. Except for necessary donations, all other donations and taxes will be suspended. Meng Guangpeng, chairman of the Relief Association, expressed his acceptance of all of these. In the past, the collection of field taxes in various counties was quite strict. Now, due to the severity of the disaster and the difficulties of the people, a special change has been made to the original plan, and six separate methods have been formulated in accordance with the disaster relief regulations issued by the Ministry and the customs of the province: (1) Those affected by more than 90% of the disaster will be exempted from 80% of the regular tax; (2) Those affected by 80% of the disaster will be exempted from 60% of the regular tax; (3) Those affected by 70% of the disaster will be exempted from 50% of the regular tax; (4) Those affected by 60% of the disaster will be exempted from 30% of the regular tax; (5) Those affected by 50% of the disaster will be exempted from 20% of the regular tax; (6) For those with more serious crop failures that are close to becoming a disaster, 10% of the regular tax will be exempted. The benefits to the disaster victims are by no means small. However, it is still unknown whether the mu tax, which is related to security, can be reduced. (5th)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Jiangxi Becomes More Serious</h3>
<p>The Number of Counties Reporting Disasters Has Exceeded Half</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar and Everything is Expensive</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. Since the heavy rain on June 15th and 16th in this province, the weather has been scorching hot and not a drop of rain has fallen. On June 27th, Little Heat, the paddy fields in slightly higher terrain and farther from water have already experienced drought. Since Little Heat, the drought has been extremely severe, the fields have cracked, and the color of the rice has turned yellow. In previous years, 70% to 80% of the early rice would have matured by Little Heat, but this year, due to the excessively cold weather in April, most of the early rice has rotted and the rice seedlings were planted too late, resulting in slow development. Although Little Heat has arrived, they have not been able to bear fruit. At the same time, many of the late rice seedlings have also withered and turned yellow. Two-season rice must be sown after the early rice is harvested. Now, there is no water for planting rice seedlings anywhere, so there is no hope at all. The farmers are trying their best to scoop water to save the fields near the water, but the higher fields are cracked with gaps as wide as several inches. The rice seedlings are as red as the needles of withered pine trees, as if they were on fire and about to burn. At present, out of the 81 counties and 5 special administrative districts in this province, 41 counties and districts, including Linchuan, Shangrao, Shanggao, Wuning, and Yangxi, have reported drought. The disaster situation in the counties in the bandit areas is even more tragic. The head of Suichuan County telegraphed the relief committee, saying that the residents of Wudoujiang and other places are struggling to survive on grass roots and tree bark under the double disaster of banditry and drought. If Suichuan is like this, then the situations in Yu, Rui, Hui, Xing, Shi, and other bandit areas can be imagined.</p>
<p>In this city, rice prices have soared in the past ten days, from 6 yuan to 10.05 yuan, and are still continuing to rise. The prices of all other goods have also risen accordingly. Vegetables are twice as expensive as in May and June. In the past, 1 yuan could buy 7.5 jin of oil, but now it can only buy 6 jin. The general public feels that the drought is becoming more serious due to the rising prices. As for relief, the provincial government has approved the Executive Headquarters to allocate 200,000 yuan from the Four Provinces Farmers Bank to purchase water-lifting machines. It is said that more than ten seats have been ordered and will be transported soon. There are no specific measures for drilling wells and diverting water, which require too much expense and will not help in time. If it can rain before the Beginning of Autumn, the farmers will replant buckwheat, beans, and other miscellaneous grains in the hope of compensating for the loss. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Internal Disintegration of Xiao's Bandits</h3>
<p>| Bandit Leader Disguises Himself as a Soldier to Avoid Assassination |</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. The Jiangxi Executive Headquarters reported, according to the report from the head of Taihe County, that seven bandits with guns surrendered to the Bao Lian Office in Qiaotou on the 26th, and they reported that there were five companies of bandits stationed in Qiaotou, with more than 500 guns, and three companies stationed in Jindong, with more than 300 guns. The bandits, realizing that they were in a desperate situation, and because they had recently been bombed by planes and feared destruction, were surrendering one after another. Half of the bandits in Qiaotou have fled, and more than one company of troops has also left Jindong. Most of them detoured back to Yongcheng, and hundreds of them have also surrendered to the eighth district of the county and the seventh district of Ji'an. It was found that most of the squad leaders and above in the bandit unit were from Hunan, and most of the soldiers were from Yongxin. Recently, the oppression by the officers has reached its extreme. Not only have they lost their fighting ability, but they all intend to surrender with their guns. The bandit leader Xiao Ke and other important officers have all disguised themselves as soldiers, partly to prevent soldiers from rioting and being assassinated, and partly to pretend to be soldiers and surrender in desperation. According to the above information, the bandit army has indeed disintegrated internally. Now, we are using both suppression and pacification, and it can be expected that the remaining bandits in western Jiangxi will be wiped out soon.</p>
<p>Also, a report from Xu Yuanquan said that the bandits entrenched in the mountainous area bordering Lichuan and Xianfeng counties include Wang Wencheng, Hua Shuntao, and Liu Han. After repeated dispatches of troops to suppress them, they fled back to the Bajiatai, Xiaodongping, and Huodongping areas in Xian County. It was recently heard that Wang, under the pretext of summoning Hua and Liu to a meeting at the Qianyanjiaodong Cave, had already taken revenge on Hua and Liu and killed Wang Wencheng. Wang's younger brother led the remaining bandits to flee to the northwest of Dachun. It has been ordered to the various units to pursue and suppress the bandits in different directions in order to completely eliminate them. (August 5th)</p>
<h3>Critical Situation on the Grand Canal in Liaocheng</h3>
<p>| The Construction Department Orders Qingping and Linqing Counties to Remove Earth Dams |</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Due to heavy rains and the influx of water, the water level in the Grand Canal in Liaocheng, Shandong Province, has risen sharply. The downstream is blocked by earth dams, and the discharge is slow, causing dangerous conditions. The Construction Department received a telegram from Sun Tongfeng, the magistrate of the county, yesterday, saying that the water in the Grand Canal was turbulent. Because it was blocked by earth dams between Qingping and Linqing, it could not flow downstream, causing the embankment behind the Iron Pagoda Temple outside the North Gate to almost collapse. Fortunately, the people desperately rushed to block it, and it was able to turn the corner. According to the telegram, the Construction Department urgently telegraphed Qingping and Linqing counties yesterday (the 4th) to quickly remove the earth dams in order to discharge the accumulated water from the upper reaches. At the same time, it replied to Liaocheng for information. Also, Sun Tongfeng, the magistrate of Liaocheng County, telegraphed the provincial government of Han Fuqu, reporting the latest situation of the Grand Canal and asking him to quickly order Qingping and Linqing counties to open the gates to release water. Han asked the Construction Department for information. The telegram read, "I recently received a telephone call from Sun Tongfeng, the magistrate of Liaocheng County, reporting that the water level in the Grand Canal in this county has risen sharply. All dangerous situations of bridges and embankments outside the North Gate being washed away have been reported in telegrams. Now, I will report the latest situation again. 1. The water in the Grand Canal continues to rise, originating from the water from Yanggu Taochengpu and the Twelve Lianwa, which flows northward. 2. The water level in the Grand Canal in Qingping and Linqing counties is not high. Please telegraph the two counties to open the gates to release water in order to discharge the water. 3. The embankment at the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Tuhai River has collapsed, leaving only one meter of width. We are currently leading laborers to reinforce it. 4. The embankments on the east and west banks of the Grand Canal behind the Great Temple in the East Gate of this city are very thin and are in danger. We are still supervising the group police and laborers to do their best to protect them. 5. Water seepage on the west bank of the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Zhou Gong River is being prevented. In addition to sending a separate telegram to the head of the Construction Department, I hereby telegraph this report. Why are the Qingping and Linqing counties not opening the gates? Please investigate the reason and report it for verification and decision. (Signed) Chairman Han Fuqu." After receiving the telegram, the Construction Department immediately replied, "In response to your secret telegram, reporting the situation of the Grand Canal rising sharply according to the telephone report from the magistrate of Liaocheng County, and requesting that Qingping and Linqing counties be telegraphed to open the gates to release water, and ordering the reason why the two counties did not open the gates to be presented for verification and decision, it was found that there were no gates built in the Qingping and Linqing counties. The old abandoned gates also have no gates, so there should be no water obstruction. The reason for the water rise in Liaocheng is that the river crossing roads in Liangshui Town, Qingping County Weiwan, Daiwan, 20-li Pu, and the second gate behind the Jinde Society in the west gate of Linqing County 20-li Pu are all earth dams, and there are no bridge holes for water discharge. When the river was dredged, the Dredging and Treatment of the Grand Canal Project Office of this department was afraid of obstructing traffic and temporarily reserved them, and ordered them to be removed during the flood season. Recently, according to the separate telegram from Liaocheng County to the department, strict telegrams have been sent to the counties in the lower reaches, ordering them to quickly mobilize laborers to excavate all the earth dams that block water to facilitate discharge, and the handling situation has been sent by letter to the secretariat of your office for submission. Now, in response to the previous cause, the Construction Department, Zhang Honglie, bows and reports for your inspection." (5th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang County Government Urges Opium Smokers to Register</h3>
<p>The county government of this county previously received an order from the province to form a committee to handle opium suppression matters. It has issued a notice to the various sub-stations and rural townships to inform opium smokers to register. However, opium smokers are watching each other, so since the registration began on June 1st, few have registered in the past two months. Now, County Chief Jin has issued a proclamation, stating that the deadline for opium smokers to apply for registration was originally from June 1st to August 31st, which is the registration period for opium smokers. Now, it has been found that two-thirds of the deadline has passed. Opium smokers under your jurisdiction are urged to go to the local public security office to apply for registration. If they fail to report after the deadline, not only will they no longer be issued licenses, but once they are discovered or reported, they will be treated as opium offenders and reported to the provincial government and forwarded to the Military Commission for handling in accordance with military law. Do not wait and see and delay yourselves. Now that the deadline is approaching, more opium smokers are gradually registering.</p>
<h3>Prolonged Drought, No Rain, and Cracked Rice Fields</h3>
<p>The weather has been hot recently, and the temperature indoors often exceeds 100 degrees. There has been no rain for almost a month. The river water has dried up, and the riverbed is completely exposed during the day. Residents have difficulty with drinking water and irrigating farmland. The tide must start to rise at midnight, but it is also very weak, so farmers cannot scoop water, and the farmland is cracked. The general farmers are all frowning with worry.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Farmers Block Chengxi Automobiles</h3>
<p>The waterway between Xicheng Province and the fourth bridge near Sitou Town, due to drought and dry water, the bottom of the bridge is more than three feet higher than the bottom of the river, and the water flow is blocked, resulting in more than 6,000 mu of farmland north of the bridge that rely on irrigation being dry. The crowd clamored and reported to the Construction Bureau, which invited Sun Chenchu of the Xicheng Long-distance Automobile Company to negotiate. It was agreed that the Construction Bureau would cooperate with the district township head to allocate a water-lifting machine to be stationed at the Luoxia Bridge next to the fourth bridge day and night for rescue. The Xicheng Automobile Company posted 200 yuan for the diesel engine worker's salary, paying 100 yuan first and the remaining 100 yuan to be paid on August 4th. Now that the due date has arrived, the villagers specially sent Hua Wenjie to the company to collect it. However, the company claimed that it had not been paid. The villagers, believing that the company had broken its promise, immediately gathered six or seven hundred people, each carrying hoes and iron rakes, and waited in full force on the bridge deck, preparing to dismantle the bridge, resulting in traffic being blocked. A total of seven large cars and nine small cars were blocked. After five or six hours, a major disaster almost occurred. Fortunately, District Chief Jiang Zhizhong arrived to mediate and promised to pay the money, and then everyone dispersed and traffic resumed.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Skyrocket to 12 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market has been rising wildly in recent days, and the trend is becoming stronger and stronger. The reason is that rice prices in various places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and Tianjin have also been rising recently, so purchasing agents are very interested. After the rice market opened yesterday, japonica and indica grains all rose by 4 or 5 jiao. White japonica rice has reached the 12 yuan mark, followed by 11.4 yuan, machine white 13 yuan to 12.5 yuan, machine big indica 10.09 yuan to 10.04 yuan, machine guest indica 9.55 yuan to 8.8 yuan, coarse japonica rice 10.06 yuan to 10 yuan, japonica paddy 5.65 yuan to 5.5 yuan, yuan paddy 6.5 yuan to 6.35 yuan, big indica paddy 5.15 yuan to 5 yuan, guest indica paddy 4.55 yuan to 4.2 yuan, Du wheat 6.12 yuan to 6.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Model Area Promotes Silkworm Rearing Guidance</h3>
<p>In order to promote the scope of silkworm rearing guidance and improve the effectiveness of guidance, the office of the Silkworm and Mulberry Model Area of this county, in accordance with the regulations of the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement and Management Committee, has established five central guidance centers in the silkworm and mulberry centers of the county. The first central area is located in Banqiao Beizhuang, with instructors You Zhenhua, Yin Hong, and Zhang Qirong, covering the townships of Yangming, Xin'an, and Kaihua. The second central area is located in Houzhai, with instructors Wu Junmei, Gao Shu, and Chen Yige, covering the townships of Taibo and Nanyan. The third central area is located in Donghutang, with instructors Wang Shiyi, Gu Wanying, and Yin Shuzhen, covering the townships of Huai Shang, Huai Xia, and Bei Shang. The fourth central area is located in Xizhang, with instructors Xu Yiru and Chen Yi, covering the townships of Tianshang, Tianxia, and Qingcheng. The fifth central area is located in Outangqiao, with instructors Wu Mengying, Tan Zhiyun, and Xue Suojuan, covering the townships of Kaihua, Wan'an, Fu'an, and Kaiyuan. Each district is divided into several guidance sub-centers. A total of 88 sub-centers have been established in the county, with as many as 170 or 180 instructors. All of them have been hired to Xicheng and are scheduled to depart for the countryside around the 10th of this month to engage in autumn silkworm work.</p>
<h3>Strange Pests Found in Mashan, Changzhou</h3>
<p>The eleventh district of Wu County is located in the lake and is different from other districts. Recently, a kind of insect that damages crops has been discovered in the four villages of Taohua, Yong'an, Shenxian, and Zhaiquan near Majishan. The insects resemble white worms and specialize in gnawing rice seedlings. More than a dozen acres of fields have been damaged by them. The villagers felt that they had never seen this kind of pest before and found it very strange. They tried to catch them, but the insects all hid in the mud, making it impossible to exterminate them. As a result, panic arose and the insects are spreading daily, already reaching four villages. Ding Zhigui, the head of the district, reported that he went to inspect the situation himself and also felt powerless to eliminate them. So he captured several pests and brought them to the city on the 6th, and took them to the county government on the morning of the 7th to study them and ask for methods of extermination.</p>
<h3>Shen Baixian and Others from Haimen Go to Hai for Inspection</h3>
<p>Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, Zhao Zhiyou, the chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, and Song Xishang, the director of the Engineering Department, arrived in Tongcheng yesterday (the 4th) on the Lijian ferry to plan the soil protection project in the county. Zhang Weixie, the magistrate of this county, Chen Guiqing, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, Wang Bin, the magistrate of Chongming County, and Li Baojian, the magistrate of Qidong County, who had finished attending the administrative conference in Tongcheng, accompanied Shen, Zhao, Song, and others to Hai today (the 5th) at 9:00 AM to inspect the Dasheng Third Factory and the Qinglonggang Waterway, and instructed the key points of the Puchi (Pukou to Qidong) Road project. At 12:00, people from all walks of life had a banquet at the County Chamber of Commerce, and in the afternoon, they took a special car to the reclamation area and then went to Rugao.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Downstream Treatment Project in Nantong</h3>
<p>The current situation of the Yangtze River is deteriorating, especially the section from Jiangyin to Haikou. The river surface between Nantong and Changshu is 80 to 90 li wide, and the river is studded with silt and sand, which the shipping industry regards as a dangerous place. Since there is so much silt and sand, the river flow has changed direction, and the north bank has been severely eroded. Nantong has suffered the most. Zhao Zhiyou, the chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, Song Xishang, the director of the Engineering Department, and Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, specially came to Tongcheng on the 4th and took the Lijian ferry in the morning and afternoon to survey the area along the river, and decided to carry out the downstream treatment, which will be implemented by the River Management Committee. The plan is to build two jetties at Haibeigang, 30 li upstream of the Langshan River in Nantong. Two stone jetties will be built in the Chanyin Sand Section and Shansha Section to the vicinity of Buyugang. Four jetties will be built between Yaogang and Rengang. This is the first step of the project. After implementation, more than 2,000 mu of sand can be raised outside Haibeigang to form fields, worth more than 2 million yuan. The second step of the project is to build 11 stone jetties in Changyin Sand. The total cost of the front and rear projects is 400,000 yuan. If all of them are completed, the river flow will definitely change direction, and the silt and sand in the Tongzhou River will definitely be washed into the sea by the rapid flow. Since the water flow is straight, it should not wash away the banks anymore. As for the current palliative treatment, Song, the director of the Engineering Department, specially instructed Zhou Kebao, the director of the Nantong Construction Bureau, to rush to repair the jetties on the river surface that have not yet sunk. On the one hand, the Waterway Association will send a survey team to Tongcheng to measure the water depth along the river. The River Management Committee will construct according to the survey.</p>
<h3>Careless Incident at Funing Shen Gan's Kerosene Store</h3>
<p>Shen Gan's store, located on the South Main Street of this city, which deals in foreign oil, rented tile-roofed houses behind the Catholic Church on East Street as a kerosene storage depot last year. Suddenly, at 2:30 PM yesterday, a fire broke out, and flames soared into the sky. The entire city was covered in smoke, obscuring the sun, and the smell of oil filled the air, creating a terrifying scene. Over a hundred households in the vicinity hired boats and hurriedly moved their belongings. Fortunately, the Provincial Security Team stationed here and various fire brigades rushed to the scene and desperately fought the fire, preventing it from spreading to nearby buildings. They also managed to salvage over two hundred boxes of foreign oil. It is estimated that over a thousand boxes of kerosene, along with hundreds of boxes each of matches and paper cigarettes, and over a hundred packages of foreign sugar, and over four hundred boxes of Sunlight soap, totaling over ten thousand dollars, were destroyed. The fire was finally extinguished at 6:30 PM. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Six firefighters were injured and have been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Bandits Occupy Yangji Town</h3>
<p>It has been reported in this newspaper that the home of Liu Ruwei in Yangji Town, within the fourth district of this county, was robbed and murdered by bandits yesterday. It is now learned that the bandits have gathered over two hundred people and are occupying the vicinity of Qinggou, hiding during the day and venturing out at night. The local population is unable to resist. Whenever troops are dispatched, the bandits flee into the marshes, leaving no trace. As soon as the troops leave, they return with renewed force. Yesterday at midnight, the bandits once again occupied Yangji Town. It is reported that the Headquarters of the Defense Corps has devised a plan for a forceful suppression.</p>
<h3>Tragic News of Suicides Among Flood Victims in Jiashan</h3>
<p>The severe drought in this county continues, and the areas of Dayun, Zhanghui, and others have also been afflicted by rice borers, leading to a hopeless autumn harvest and a lack of sustenance. Frequent reports of peasants in the countryside hanging themselves or taking poison have been heard. We hereby report the facts: (1) Wang A'shi, a farmer from Huoshanjing, married to a woman named Wang, worked diligently in the fields. However, the river channels dried up, making irrigation impossible, and the young seedlings withered long ago. Wang's wife went out to help others draw water, but all her wages were taken by her aunt, who spent them all. When she asked her aunt for the money back, she was scolded. Overwhelmed by the hardship of life and the abuse, Wang's wife suddenly became suicidal and hanged herself on the night before last. (2) Shen A'quan, a farmer from Changbang in the Yong'an district, owned only seven mu of land, making it difficult to support his family. Adding to this, the severe drought withered the rice, making recovery impossible. Witnessing this, A'quan abandoned his wife and children and disappeared without a trace. His wife cried all day and, left with no other choice, took her young daughter and drowned in the river. (3) Shen Sanguan, a farmer from Zhonggangjing, and Zhang Siqing, a farmer from Fushanjing, both committed suicide due to starvation. Such tragic events are occurring incessantly, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<h3>Bandits from Gaoyou Plunder Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>The Tianhua Kerosene Company and Lishengheng General Merchandise Store in Linze Town of this county dispatched ships to Xinghua to transport goods the day before yesterday, carrying over seven hundred silver dollars. However, when they reached the Yangzilincao Marsh, they encountered six bandit ships with fifty to sixty bandits who had been routed by government troops from Xiaogezhuang. The bandits ordered them to stop, jumped onto the cargo ships, and conducted a thorough search. They not only stole all the money but also kidnapped Chen, the young clerk escorting the ships, and sailed eastward.</p>
<h3>Bandits Zhu Zhongren and Others Executed by Firing Squad in Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Jingjiang, located in the remote north of the Yangtze River, is a place with little land and a dense population. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy, many undesirable elements have become bandits, leading to frequent robberies and causing considerable harm. Last month, the home of Gao Chengyuan in the eighth district was robbed by bandits, and the owner was injured. Subsequently, Captain Wang of the Security Department and Xuan Ming, the head of the county government's task force, rushed to the countryside at night and arrested the main culprits, Zhu Zhongren, Wang Jinzhang, Li Xiaogouzi, Wu Liuxiao, and others. After interrogation by Judge Bao Cheng, they confessed to their crimes. The case was immediately reported to the provincial government, which issued a telegram approving the death penalty. After receiving the telegram, the county government verified the identities of Zhu Zhongren and others, tied them to the execution ground, and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Having read the report in the "Various County Communications" column on page three of your newspaper on July 27th, which stated that "Zhou Zhiqing, the water patrol chief of Lingdian Port in Haimen, was caught smoking opium in the home of a prostitute (Xiao Honglin) at 3 PM on the 22nd of this month. Over two hundred opium pills were seized, and he has been taken to the bureau for investigation," we find this very surprising. Lingdian Port is under the jurisdiction of our detachment, and there is no one named Zhou Zhiqing among the patrol chiefs or water patrols of our entire detachment. We fear the report is inaccurate, and we are writing to your newspaper to request a correction. Sincerely, Xu Guozhang, Captain of the First Detachment, Thirteenth Team, Third District, Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Force, to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>French Navy in China</h3>
<p>Conducted Large-Scale Maneuvers in Waters off Zhoushan Yesterday</p>
<p>French Warships from Shanghai Sailed to Participate in Maneuvers</p>
<p>French Consulate General Notified Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>The French Far East Naval Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Lax, has decided to hold large-scale maneuvers in Zhejiang waters. The waters off Zhoushan have been selected as the location for the French warships to conduct their exercises. The exercise dates have been set from the afternoon of the 6th of this month to the 16th, for a total of ten days.</p>
<p>French Warships Set Sail</p>
<p>Some French warships stationed in China remain docked in Shanghai, while others are on patrol. For these maneuvers, Rear Admiral Lax, the French naval commander, has summoned all ships to Zhoushan to participate. The cruisers Premengue and the gunboat S de Brazza, stationed in Shanghai, completed their preparations yesterday morning and set sail from Songkou to join the exercises. The dispatch vessel Savorgnan de Brazza and the flagship D’Entrecasteaux are also expected to sail to Zhoushan to participate.</p>
<p>Commander to Observe Maneuvers</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Lax, the commander of the French Far East Naval Fleet, has decided to personally observe the maneuvers to facilitate command. However, he will wait until the warships have conducted several days of preliminary exercises before boarding the flagship D’Entrecasteaux on the 11th of this month to travel to Zhoushan. The admiral also plans to stay in the Zhoushan Islands for a period of leisure after the exercises.</p>
<p>Notification to Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The French Navy’s exercises are scheduled for ten days, during which all aspects of naval warfare will be practiced. Live ammunition will be used, and searchlights will be deployed at night, which differs from previous years. Therefore, the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Meyrier, has notified the Zhejiang Provincial Government to inform residents along the coast of Zhoushan and to notify all commercial vessels, fishing boats, and civilian vessels traveling in Zhejiang waters to remain calm.</p>
<p>Bank Savings Association Trust Company</p>
<h3>Held a Joint Tea Party Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unanimous Agreement to Adhere to Principles of Bank Savings Law</p>
<p>But Requesting Modifications to Provisions of Law That Are Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Following the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the Banking Association decided to request amendments. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the association hosted a joint tea party at its clubhouse on Hong Kong Road, inviting banks, trust companies, and savings associations from across the city. A unanimous resolution was passed to request amendments to provisions of the law that are difficult to implement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Tea Party</p>
<p>Yesterday's joint tea party was attended by Hu Gesheng of Hua An, Chen Ziai of Zhizhong, Zhang Cantang of Wuhua, Chen Guangqing of Guanghua, Shen Binzhang of Yadong, Zhu Qinpu of Zhengming, Lu Mengfu of China Industrial Development, Jin Caisheng of China Industrial, Chen Shizhen of Hong Kong National, Wu Weiru of Donglai, Yu Zhongyan of Huizhong, Xu Ruizhang of Siming Savings Association, Cai Songfu of Dunxu, Qi Yunqing of Nonggong, Tong Xianting of Zhonghua, Wei Shouren of Jiangzhe, Xu Boming of Jiangsu, Hu Xianshi of Siming, Shen Hegao of Jia Hua, Wang Chengzhi of Taiping, Yu Shouchun of Tongshang, Bao Chengde of Jianghai, Shi Boqun of Six Banks, Xu Rihkang of Xintong, Mi Xialing of Zhonghe, Huang Mohan of Juxingcheng, Gu Wensheng of Jiande, Chen Qinghua of Dalai, Chen Dairu of Zhejiang, Lin Pingfu of Guotai, Xia Gaoxiang of Qiye, Zhang Zhanglu of Guohua, Yuan Jiatang of Jiangnan, Zou Cuihua of Southeast Trust, Hua Shuochen of Tonghui Trust, Dong Huixun of Fu Dian, Wang Boyuan of Kenye, Chen Zisheng of Central Trust, Pei Huizhi of Women's, Xu Xuegeng of Xintai, Yao Yinpeng of Zhonghui, Zhang Zhuyu of Guohuo, Tang Shoumin of Jiaotong, Zhou Zongyun of Zhongnan, Shen Bingheng of Bianye, Chen Zheqing of Yan Ye, Miao Zhendong of Minghua, Shu Luzhong of Huifeng, Li Wenjie of Tongyi Trust, Chen Guangfu of Shanghai, Wu Zhihao of Ningbo, Xie Yuru of World, Yuan Mengling of Quangong, Ma Changsheng of Shanghai National, Wu Rongqing of Minfu, Le Gengrong of Hengli, Wang Zhixin of Xinhua, Ye Fuxiao of Dalu, Gao Dajing of Shanghai Trust, Chen Liting of Jincheng, Luo Qinghua of Silk, Wang Tianshen of Zhongxing, Tang Mingsan of Overseas Chinese Trust, Chen Runshui of Tongyuan, and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association.</p>
<p>Agreed Measures</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu, the chairman, first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a report from Secretary-General Lin Kanghou on the circumstances of the various meetings of the Banking Association after the National Government promulgated the Savings Bank Law and ordered all banks to implement it immediately, as well as the provisions of Article 9 of the law. A discussion followed, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Unanimous agreement to adhere to the principles of the Savings Bank Law; (2) Requesting amendments to provisions of the law that are difficult to implement; (3) Temporarily suspending implementation until amendments are made. It was also decided that the Banking Association would send copies of the telegram to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance, along with the full text of the Savings Bank Law, to all member banks, non-member banks, savings associations, and trust companies within three days to solicit opinions. If the wording is deemed unnecessary to be amended, the Banking Association will then revise it, send it to all non-member banks, savings associations, and trust companies for sealing, and then send it out. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM, with everyone in high spirits.</p>
<p>Government's Views</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired yesterday about the Ministry of Finance's views on the banking sector's request to amend the Savings Bank Law: (1) The Ministry of Finance is an executive body, not a legislative body. Since the National Government promulgated and implemented the law, the Ministry of Finance can only submit the banking sector's opinions to the Executive Yuan to consult the Legislative Yuan for further study. (2) It has been ordered that all banks, in accordance with Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, deposit government bonds equivalent to one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits in a special vault set up by the Central Bank as collateral for the repayment of savings deposits. However, the banking sector has requested to use other assets as collateral. This point will be considered. According to the Ministry of Finance's investigation, fixed-term deposits account for 60% of the total deposits in each bank, while current deposits account for 40%. Although one or two banks have current deposits exceeding fixed-term deposits, they are in the minority. Therefore, depositing one-quarter of the security deposit is not difficult. (3) Banks depositing one-quarter of the total savings deposits in government bonds with the Central Bank to maintain credibility could be done by inviting the banks to participate in the organization and management of the vault by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing states that the Executive Yuan has received a petition from the Shanghai Banking Association requesting amendments to the Savings Bank Law and will forward it to the Legislative Yuan for handling. According to the Ministry of Finance, the banking sector sent representatives to participate in drafting the law, and there should be no major difficulties. It seems unnecessary to make amendments just after the law has been implemented. As for Article 9, which stipulates that each bank should purchase government bonds equivalent to one-quarter of its savings deposits and hand them over to the Central Bank for safekeeping, it will still be strictly implemented and is difficult to change.</p>
<p>Reopening After Five Years of Suspension</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Commercial Bank to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Old Shares Converted and 3 Million New Shares Added</p>
<p>Head Office Established in Shanghai to Issue Banknotes</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hankou Branches to Open on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that the government-private joint venture Agricultural and Commercial Bank, which suspended operations in March 1929, is now planning to increase its capital and resume operations under the Ministry of Industry. The head office will be located in Shanghai, with branches established in various locations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Commercial Bank was founded in 1923 by Gao Lingwei, then Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. The head office was located in Beijing, and the manager was Mr. Jin Caisheng. Branches were established in Shanghai and Tianjin. The paid-up capital was 1,731,000 yuan, and banknotes were issued. It was a government-private joint venture. In March 1929, the bank suspended operations, and all branches were ordered to close. The banknotes issued in Shanghai were all redeemed at face value.</p>
<p>Implementation of Resumption</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, planned to revive the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and dispatched the Chief of General Affairs, Mei Zhezhi, to make preparations and increase shareholders. Preparations are now complete, and operations will be resumed. It will still be a government-private joint venture. The former share capital has been converted to 800,000 yuan, and 2,200,000 yuan in new shares have been issued, totaling 3,000,000 yuan. All shares have been fully subscribed. The registration has been submitted and approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and a business license has been issued, along with permission to issue convertible notes.</p>
<p>Organization Details</p>
<p>The head office of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank is located at No. 515, Henan Road, near Ningbo Road, Shanghai. The board of directors consists of 15 members: Chen Gongbo (Chairman), Jiang Danning, Cheng Hejun, Liu Fuxuan, Zhang Rongchu, Mei Zhezhi, Wang Tiesheng, Tang Feifan, Liang Junhua, He Zhuoxian, Mei Jingxiang, Liu Bangrui, Chen Haiqiu, and Wu Ruiyuan. Mei Zhezhi will serve as the general manager. Branches are being prepared for establishment in Shanghai and Hankou first. Locations such as Beijing and Tianjin are still in progress.</p>
<p>Branch Openings</p>
<p>The Shanghai and Hankou branches have been prepared and are scheduled to open simultaneously on the 15th of this month. The notice is as follows: "Our bank has collected a capital of 3 million yuan and has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and a business license has been issued. We have also been granted permission to issue convertible notes. We are scheduled to open for business on August 15th. This notice is hereby given." The Shanghai branch is located at the intersection of Henan Road and Ningbo Road, in the same location as the head office.</p>
<p>Banknote Issuance</p>
<p>After the government approved the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to issue banknotes, it decided to issue the banknotes that had been printed but not yet issued by the former Agricultural and Commercial Bank, in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The previously printed banknotes have been collected from Beijing by representatives from the head office and will be distributed to the Shanghai and Hankou branches for issuance.</p>
<p>Report to Beijing</p>
<p>General Manager Mei Zhezhi has decided to resign from his position as Chief of General Affairs of the Ministry of Industry in order to devote himself to the affairs of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. As the Shanghai and Hankou branches are scheduled to open, he took the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train to Beijing the night before last to report to the Minister. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in the next day or two. Minister Chen Gongbo is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing to attend the opening of the Shanghai branch.</p>
<p>Shen Hsin Textile Corporation</p>
<h3>Established Improvement Committee</h3>
<p>Rong Weiren Appointed Chairman and Has Begun Work</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Formed by Creditor Banks</p>
<p>Experts to Be Hired to Design and Organize Various Factories</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shen Hsin Textile Corporation, has established an improvement committee and a supervisory committee, and will hire experts to design and organize the Shen Hsin factories since returning to his post. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of Improvement Committee</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shen Hsin Textile Corporation, has established an improvement committee for the purpose of self-organization. Rong Weiren, Rong Zongjing's nephew, has been appointed as the chairman. The committee consists of fifteen members, comprising managers from various factories and senior personnel from the head office. The committee is divided into three groups: general affairs, business, and factory affairs. The general affairs group has three members, the business group has four members, and the factory affairs group has four members. It has been formally established and is located in the head office on Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Formation of Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>After the establishment of the improvement committee, it was decided to establish a supervisory committee. The number of committee members has also been internally determined and will be formally established soon. The supervisory committee members will be appointed by creditor banks, such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai. The purpose is to supervise the business development of the various factories under the Shen Hsin Textile Corporation. Experts in the textile industry will be hired to assist in the design and organization. The selection of experts is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Soaring Rice Prices for Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Already Exceeded the Thirteen Yuan Price Limit</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Industry Guild Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Great Republic News Agency reports that due to the persistent drought in recent days and the scarcity of rice supplies from the interior, rice prices have been soaring for consecutive days. Top-grade white rice has already exceeded thirteen yuan. The Bean and Rice Industry Guild held an emergency executive and supervisory meeting yesterday, reiterating the price restriction. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs also dispatched personnel to investigate rice merchants and prevent price gouging. The actual amount of imported rice ordered by the banking industry and rice merchants has reached over 400,000 piculs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar Beyond Price Limit</p>
<p>Since the change in weather around the 17th and 18th of last month in this city, with successive showers, rice prices gradually declined. Top-grade white rice from Changshu and Wuxi had dropped from thirteen yuan to twelve yuan at the customs. Public morale was slightly eased. However, in the recent week, the drought returned, and rice prices in this city have soared again. Yesterday, in the North and South city rice markets, second-grade rice from Tongli was priced at twelve yuan and sixty-seven cents. Although the market price of top-grade white rice from the Xichang region remained at thirteen yuan, transactions were secretly inflated by five cents to one yuan. In fact, it has exceeded the price limit. In the past two days, Indica rice and imported rice have each risen by seven or eight cents daily, and there is still a trend of continued price increases.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting to Warn Fellow Traders</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Guild held a special emergency meeting yesterday at Cuixiu Hall. Gu Xinyi, Jiang Zisheng, Zhu Yunchang, Lu Jing</p>
<p>German Consulate General</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for the Late President Tonight</h3>
<p>At 6 PM in the German Church</p>
<p>All German Residents in Shanghai to Attend and Pay Respects</p>
<p>The German Consul General in Shanghai, Klieber, has scheduled a memorial service for the late President Hindenburg tonight at 6 PM in the square of the German Church at the corner of Haig Road and Great Western Road. Mayor Wu, leaders of various organizations, and consuls and military attaches from various countries have been invited to attend. The service will follow a religious ceremony, and all German residents in Shanghai will attend to pay their final respects.</p>
<p>de, Wen Fuqian, Yin Huancun, Ye Tingfan, Fu Changyu, Luo Rongzhou, Cai Yukun, Jiang Hongbin, and Chen Yuming attended. Chaired by Gu Xinyi, the following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the recent upward trend in rice prices, and how to restrict it, it was resolved to reiterate the previous resolution and notify fellow traders that the highest price for white rice, under any circumstances, must not exceed thirteen yuan. (2) Regarding the establishment of accurate statistics for imported rice orders, it was resolved that all traders who order imported rice must first report and register in detail with the Bureau of Social Affairs and other grain guilds for unified control. After the meeting, an emergency notice was issued, stating that the guild had convened a temporary members' meeting on July 15th and resolved that the highest price for white rice should not exceed thirteen yuan, with corresponding prices for other grades. In addition to notifying all traders to comply, the matter was also reported to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. However, the recent weather has been extremely dry, and the source of rice is not abundant, leading to an upward trend in rice prices. In order to suppress rice prices and maintain the food supply for the people, this guild hereby reiterates the previous resolution, urging all traders to pay attention. The highest price for white rice, under any circumstances, must not exceed thirteen yuan. Otherwise, if discovered by the authorities, this guild cannot be held responsible. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs to Dispatch Personnel to Prevent Price Gouging</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs is paying close attention to the soaring rice prices, which affect the food supply for the people. After receiving news yesterday that top-grade white rice had exceeded thirteen yuan, the head of the Fourth Section, Zhang Binghui, immediately inquired about the truth from Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Guild, at 10 AM. In addition to formally issuing an order based on the previous resolution passed at the Grain Conference, which restricted rice prices from exceeding thirteen yuan, Grain Section Chief Zhou Minggang was also dispatched to conduct investigations and prevent rice merchants from raising market prices at any time.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that although the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has ordered rice merchants to restrict rice prices and not exceed thirteen yuan due to the recent surge in rice prices, it is feared that rice prices will continue to rise based on the current situation. Therefore, it is planned to jointly investigate rice reserves in various regions with the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and request transportation agencies to prioritize transporting rice reserves from various regions to Shanghai to suppress rice prices. Regarding the matter of ordering imported rice, if it is determined that domestic rice reserves are indeed lacking, the bureau will consult with the governments of the two provinces to request instructions from the central government for handling. The bureau has already submitted these opinions to the municipal government for forwarding to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for joint consultation and handling.</p>
<p>Registration for Ordering Imported Rice</p>
<p>At the previous grain conference convened by the Bureau of Social Affairs, it was decided that after investigating domestic grain reserves, rice merchants should voluntarily order imported rice and register with the Bureau of Social Affairs. However, rice merchants only know how to seek profits. The city's banking industry and rice merchants have already ordered the first batch of 160,000 piculs of imported rice. According to the Great Republic News Agency reporter's investigation from various sources, another second batch of approximately 250,000 piculs of imported rice was ordered yesterday and today, totaling over 400,000 piculs. The Bean and Rice Industry Guild of this city fears that the market will be filled with imported rice in the future, which will harm the livelihoods of farmers. Therefore, it has specially requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to handle registration and restrict the quantity of imported rice ordered.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Replies to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Increasing Troops to Vigorously Suppress Bandits in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Foreign Tea Trade Association stating that Qimen and Fuliang in Anhui province were disturbed by bandits, affecting the tea market, and requesting the government to rigorously suppress them. The chamber immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Commander Chen of Anhui. Now, replies have been received from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Commander Chen. The original texts are recorded below: (1) Chiang's telegram states, "Telegram received. The rural areas of Anhui are troubled by bandits. Troops have been increased to suppress them." Signed, Chiang Kai-shek. (2) Chen's telegram states, "Respected telegram received. Scattered bandits disturb Qifu. With few garrison troops and weak local police, repeated disturbances by bandits are regrettable. In addition to assigning troops, the field headquarters has been requested to send additional troops to vigorously suppress them separately." Signed, Chen Tiaoyuan.</p>

According to a reporter from the National News Agency, there are many preparatory proposals for this congress, which are very important because there is fear that the World War will break out soon. Therefore, the association has decided to expand its affairs in a timely manner, prepare a large amount of medicines, stretchers, flags, etc., and plans to recruit 100,000 male and female paramedics, organize them into teams, and train them to deal with rescue work in an emergency. It is heard that this is the first congress convened since the association was directly administered by the Ministry of Interior of the National Government. As of yesterday, more than 200 branches had registered. Based on the registered branches, the association has been busy preparing and sending out congress admission certificates and ballots in recent days. At the same time, it has reported to the Ministry of Interior to send personnel to guide and supervise the election, and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Navy, etc., to send personnel to attend and guide.</p>
<p>National Products Promotion Association Cables Guangdong</p>
<h3>Abolish Special Import Tax on National Products from Outside the Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association has repeatedly received reports from member factories of cosmetics, enamel, paint, steel, hardware, rubber, matchsticks, and the China Chemical Industry Association that the Guangdong industry and commerce sectors, on the pretext that Shanghai's national product factories have many foreign investments, are dumping goods in Guangdong and are trying their best to persuade the authorities to implement taxes in order to protect the province's industry. It is heard that the authorities have approved their request, convened a local chamber of commerce meeting, and decided to set up a bureau to collect special import taxes on imported goods and national products from outside the province, hindering the promotion of national products. It is learned that the association's promotion of national products has been making rapid progress, and it is struggling to resist the encirclement and attack of foreign goods. The Guangdong industry and commerce sectors have adopted the Monroe Doctrine, ignoring the facts and encouraging the authorities to levy import taxes on national products, treating them the same as imported goods, which has a significant impact on the future of national product promotion, especially the promotion of Shanghai's national product factories' sales in South China. In addition to submitting it to the Standing Committee for consultation and relief, the secretariat yesterday telegraphed the Guangdong provincial financial authorities, stating the advantages and disadvantages, and requesting the cancellation of the original proposal to levy a special import tax on national products from outside the province in order to protect national products.</p>

<p>Public Concession</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Held a Bilateral Meeting Yesterday and Reached a Decision</p>
<p>Rickshaw Merchants in the Special District to Receive New Licenses with Certificates Starting Today</p>
<p>New Regulations to Be Implemented on the 13th, and a Mutual Aid Fund Custodian Committee to Be Established</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the rickshaw issue in the Public Concession has been ongoing for nearly a month since the dispute between the Rickshaw Committee and the rickshaw merchants began. To prevent the dispute from escalating, the Municipal Council held a bilateral meeting between the Rickshaw Committee and the rickshaw merchants yesterday morning to discuss various issues and reached considerable results. Rickshaw merchants in the Special District will receive licenses starting today, and the new regulations of the Municipal Council will be implemented on the 13th. Thus, the month-long rickshaw issue can be resolved smoothly. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of the Dispute</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council announced that it would implement new regulations from August 1st based on the recommendations of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. The rickshaw owners and pullers believed that it would greatly harm their interests. The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Guild repeatedly negotiated with the Municipal Council for an extension, but it was ineffective. Therefore, the rickshaw merchants did not receive the August licenses (10,000). The Rickshaw Committee planned to solicit new rickshaw owners, and both sides were tending toward extremes, making the situation very serious. If it had not been resolved yesterday morning, all the rickshaw merchants in the city would have suspended business, which would have affected the livelihoods of more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers. Fortunately, in addition to sending letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpayers' Association, and the Municipal Government for assistance, the industry guild also sent representatives, such as Yin Zhiling, to contact Zhong Si, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, to discuss resolving the dispute between the rickshaw merchants and the Rickshaw Committee to prevent it from escalating and affecting the livelihoods of more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers and ensuring local stability. A meeting was held at the Municipal Council conference room at 3 PM last Friday afternoon, but no concrete results were achieved. It was not until yesterday's second meeting that the issue was completely resolved.</p>
<p>Bilateral Meeting</p>
<p>The Municipal Council convened a second bilateral meeting yesterday morning at 10 AM in the Municipal Council Building, Room 140 on the second floor. The Municipal Council was represented by Director-General Zhong Si, Chief Inspector McDing, Rickshaw Committee Director Massey, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, and Associate He De Kui. The rickshaw merchants were represented by Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Mark Shi, Pei Er, and Cheng Xiechun, Chairman of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association, totaling twelve people. The meeting was chaired by Zhong Si and recorded by Bailang. First, the rickshaw merchants' representatives submitted eight proposed opinions in writing for discussion. The two sides debated fiercely and then adopted a voting system. The majority agreed (the New Voice News Agency reported that only Massey opposed) as the resolutions. The meeting adjourned at 1:15 PM.</p>
<p>Eight Opinions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rickshaw merchants' representatives submitted eight specific opinions in writing to the representatives. The following is a verbatim record: (1) The new regulations of the Municipal Council, which are to be implemented from August, stipulate that the rent for publicly licensed rickshaws in the Public Concession should be 10 cents per day per vehicle, and the rickshaw owner should pay a mutual aid fee of 1.5 yuan per month per vehicle, and an additional 1 cent per day should be collected from the rickshaw puller. The rickshaw merchants are willing to reduce the rent from 14 cents to 12 cents per day per vehicle from the date of the new license in August, including the benefits of contractors and the licenses of the Chinese, French, and British concessions. (2) In addition, the rickshaw owner will voluntarily pay 1 yuan per month per vehicle for the rickshaw puller's relief fund, which will be transferred by the rickshaw merchants' guild to nine directors for safekeeping, subject to the supervision of the Municipal Council. (3) The improvement of rickshaws should be done in cooperation with the rickshaw merchants' guild and should focus on solidity, cleanliness, and economy, rather than being flashy, so as not to increase the burden on rickshaw pullers and passengers. (4) The operation of publicly licensed rickshaws is not a simple undertaking. The first and second paragraphs of the new license regulations should be amended as follows: (a) The licensee (individual or company) should be the owner of the licensed vehicle. (b) If the licensee wishes to transfer the operation of the publicly licensed rickshaw to someone else, they should report the details and the number of licenses to the Municipal Council. (5) Rickshaw merchants need capital to prepare vehicles to obtain a license to operate, so they should have considerable security to continue operating. Therefore, the last paragraph of the third item of the new regulations should be deleted. (6) The rickshaw puller's licensing regulations and the implementation of the new regulations, such as items 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18, impose many difficulties on the rickshaw owners and should be carefully revised. (7) The registration and certification of genuine rickshaw owners are matters of property rights, which must be handled with caution. The rickshaw merchants' guild and the donors will cooperate with the Municipal Council to complete it within the time limit to avoid omissions and damage to the interests of genuine rickshaw owners. However, before the completion within the time limit, the license should be issued to the donors, who will be responsible for maintaining the Municipal Council's collection of donations from rickshaw owners and social stability. (8) To consider the rickshaw merchants' guild's recommendations and implement the new regulations effectively, a special committee on the rickshaw industry should be established, composed of five to seven representatives jointly appointed by the Municipal Council and the rickshaw merchants' guild. This committee will serve as an advisory body to the Municipal Council's rickshaw affairs agency.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The following solutions were resolved at yesterday's meeting: (1) Rickshaw merchants face the Municipal Council's decision to charge 10 cents per day for vehicles with Public Concession licenses from August 1st, with a 1 cent mutual aid fee and a prepayment of 1.5 yuan per month by the rickshaw merchants, changed to a total of 12 cents, including the licenses of the Chinese, British, and French concessions and the contractor's remuneration. (Resolution) The rent for each vehicle per day is changed to 7.8 cents, with a 0.7 cent mutual aid fee, and the rickshaw merchants will prepay 1.5 yuan per vehicle per month for the mutual aid fund, starting from August 15th. (2) The improvement of rickshaw design must solicit the opinions of rickshaw merchants and focus on solidity, cleanliness, and hygiene, not flashy design. (Resolution) Passed. (3) Rickshaw owners' certification will be extended from today to August 13th. The rickshaw merchants' guild will send personnel to assist rickshaw owners in obtaining certification and paying donations. The guild will pay 15,000 yuan for the mutual aid fee for this month. For those whose ownership has not been determined and for whom certificates cannot be issued, they are allowed to operate with their old licenses until the end of the month in order to resolve the dispute. (4) Rickshaw pullers' registration is a major issue. (Resolution) Reserved for further discussion and implementation. (5) The chairman explained that items 2 and 3 of the new regulations, regarding the rickshaw owner's property rights protection, do not harm the rickshaw pullers' legal interests. (6) Establishment of the mutual aid fund custodian committee, number of members. (Resolution) 15 people, 3 foreigners, and 12 Chinese. The rickshaw merchants will recommend two representatives, and the other three directors will be temporarily appointed by the Rickshaw Committee for a trial period of eight months, because the Rickshaw Committee established by the Municipal Council is also temporary in nature.</p>
<p>Licenses to Be Issued Today</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Municipal Council will issue 10,000 rickshaw licenses for this month in the Public Concession only after handling the rickshaw owners' certification and complying with the new regulations, which was unsatisfactory to all rickshaw owners, so they have not been issued yet. Now that the dispute has been resolved, the rickshaw owners have decided to start receiving them today, and the Municipal Council has also decided to issue them today. The Rickshaw Industry Guild of the Special District held a temporary board meeting at 7 PM last night. Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, etc., attended. The representatives who attended the Municipal Council meeting reported on the meeting process and the solution. It was resolved that the guild would send personnel to assist in obtaining the licenses from the Rickshaw Committee.</p>
<h3>Relationship Between People's Needs and Politics</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech at the Commemoration Week</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Government held a commemoration week yesterday. After Mayor Wu Tiecheng led the ceremony, he reported on "The Relationship Between People's Needs and Politics," stating: "Fellow comrades, there was a famous political scholar in ancient Western history, Plato, who once said, 'The creation of the state is due to the need to meet economic needs. An isolated person wants to use his own strength to meet his own needs and achieve a perfect life, which is absolutely impossible in reality. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on society, rely on the cooperation of the majority.' Everyone knows that Plato's thought directly originated from Socrates. Socrates also said about the origin of the state, 'The state is born to meet human needs. Humans have many needs, and no one can provide for themselves. People must help each other to meet each other's needs. This person needs help for this purpose, and that person needs help for that purpose. When these people who help each other live together, the state is born. At this time, mankind begins to have the concept of the state. Therefore, the true creator of the state is "need." (Necessity)' I often think to myself that whatever we do, we cannot succeed with one person's hands and feet. We must gain the sympathy and practical support and cooperation of the majority. Then this thing can succeed, whether it is a public matter or a private matter, I think there can be no exceptions. Especially for our government authorities, in China today, when everything is waiting to be done, how should we think about awakening the people, so that the people can express sympathy for the government? But if we only gain the sympathy of the people and cannot gain the support and cooperation of the people, our politics still cannot be developed much. The political desire of the Chinese people has always been very small, because Chinese politics in the past was mostly passive, so the people developed a habit of being very passive towards politics. Because the people are passive towards politics, it makes it difficult for politics to actively seek development. Therefore, it is not enough for us to only gain the sympathy of the people. In addition to working hard to make the people express sympathy for us, we must also work hard to make them take their strength to help us and cooperate with us. In this way, when the Chinese government authorities, in this time when everything is waiting to be done, want to do something, it can be done and there is hope of success. How can we enable the people to practically help us and cooperate with us? One thing we should know is "need." If the people can know the needs of the country today, the people will definitely be able to help the government and cooperate with the government to build the country. Therefore, our urgent task today is to make the people know the needs of the country and society today. The two words "need" can be said to be the power of human happiness and the advancement of world civilization today. Because of this human need, the world has today's advanced civilization, and all mankind has gained today's happiness. Therefore, need is the driving force of human evolution and the creative power of world culture.</p>
<p>This theory of mine is not inherited from the old ideas of Western scholars, but there is a very obvious example to support it. We only need to look at the construction of Guangzhou and Shanghai to know. First, let's talk about Shanghai. Shanghai has a population of about 3 million, and two-fifths of them live in the Special District. These two-fifths of the citizens are the most powerful people in the city. There are many who are enthusiastic about supporting the government and participating in construction, but some people think that their lives and property are protected, and their "desire for life" is satisfied, so they often ignore and do not pay much attention to the undertakings needed by the general citizens outside the Special District. But Guangzhou is slightly different. Although Guangzhou also has concessions, the so-called concession "Shameen" is very small and Chinese people are not allowed to live there. Therefore, the people of Guangzhou all live in Guangzhou, where they were born and raised. Therefore, they have a common need with the government, and they can do their best to help the government and cooperate with the government to build the city and revitalize it. That is why Guangzhou has today's construction achievements. This is an excellent example of the relationship between need and politics. Therefore, the most important thing for our government authorities is to become a clean government, not to be corrupt and pervert the law. Everyone should be a good official in order to win the sympathy of the people. But because we want to do things actively and build actively, the sympathy of the people is not enough. We must also make the people know their living needs. If the people can know their living needs, their desire for life can be expanded considerably, and they can naturally participate in and support all the construction undertakings of the government in a practical way and cooperate with the government. In this way, any thing our government wants to do, whether big or small, can have a hope of success.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I feel that there is a very great need in this city that should be carried out as soon as possible, which is the construction of public housing, which was announced two months ago. I often say and often hear people say that there are so-called phenomena of national decline and national prosperity, phenomena of family decline and family prosperity. But where can these phenomena be seen? They can be seen in the lives of the general public. Therefore, Chairman Chiang promotes the New Life Movement, not only to improve the living desire of the general public in a negative way, but it can be said that the greatest purpose of the New Life Movement is to make the people know their needs. If the people can know their needs, they will definitely be able to aspire to work hard, and they will definitely be able to take all their strength, directly or indirectly, alone or jointly, to create and participate in all the needed undertakings in order to satisfy their desire for life. In this way, a country or a nation can be revived. Therefore, I think now that we should combine the strength of the entire Shanghai to build public housing. We know that there are about 30,000 thatched houses in Shanghai. On average, five people live in each thatched house, so there are a total of 150,000 people living in thatched houses. These 150,000 people live in poverty, irregularity, irrationality, unsanitary conditions, and unhealthy lives every day. This kind of life not only affects the city's appearance, public security, and public health, etc., but also makes it difficult to start civic education. Therefore, if we want to improve the lives of the common people, it is very easy to do it in a negative way, it is not difficult, or if we only use political power to do it, we can get some results, but this effect is temporary, not permanent, because we have not fundamentally increased their living knowledge, expanded their living attitude, made them know their needs, and enabled them to improve their own lives in practice. Therefore, the purpose of our building public housing is, in a negative way, to improve their lives, so that 150,000 common people in Shanghai can live in a better place and lead a more rational, regular, and healthier life. In a positive way, we can also carry out various civic education, increase their knowledge, increase their desire for life, and enable people to aspire to work hard and become very powerful citizens. Therefore, the effectiveness of building public housing is not only negative, it can solve the problems of the city's appearance, public security, public health, civic education, etc. At the same time, because their lives have improved and their living knowledge has increased, they can more actively know greater needs and be able to actively strive to jointly solve major urban problems and seek urban prosperity. In short, the people's "needs" are very related to what our government does. If the people can know their "needs," they will not only be able to sympathize with our construction, but also be able to practically participate in and help our construction. But how to make the people know their needs and support us is still what we should strive for in China today, when everything is waiting to be done.</p>

<h3>Pudong Kaiping Warehouse Carelessly</h3>
<p>Coal Baskets Easily Ignite, Fire Raged</p>
<p>The coal basket warehouse of Pudong's Eighteen Jian Kaiping Coal Yard suddenly caught fire carelessly at around 11:00 PM last night. The coal baskets were easily flammable, so the fire spread quickly. In an instant, the fire illuminated the sky, making it impossible to approach. The nearby third district, second division learned of this and quickly notified the fire brigade, dispatching fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire. At the same time, the Pudong fireboat also sailed to assist in dousing the flames. Unfortunately, the weather was dry and it was easy for the fire to catch, so the fire actually increased rather than decreased. By midnight this morning, it had not subsided at all. As for how the fire started and how much damage was done, since it was late at night and the fire was raging, it was impossible to find out at the time.</p>
<p>Illegal Sauce Garden Sealed</p>
<h3>Chen Junfa Commits Suicide in Desperation</h3>
<p>Chen Junfa from Shaoxing, 29 years old, worked as a tea servant in the China Enterprise Bank's dormitory located at No. 84 Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road. He had always been diligent and thrifty and had saved up some money. He opened Bao Kang Sauce Garden at the intersection of Aiweniyi Road and Mei Baike Road in the Public Concession, and had been open for business for sixteen days. Because the store sold wine without obtaining a license issued by the工部局, it was ordered to close by the工部局. After repeated attempts to request one, it was ultimately difficult to obtain this license because it did not meet sanitary regulations, and he could not continue to operate. All of his capital, several hundred yuan, was completely exhausted. In desperation, he had a sudden thought and bought Lysol solution. Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, he swallowed it in the亭子間 of the Enterprise Bank dormitory and committed suicide. At noon, his companions urged him to have lunch, and that's when they discovered what happened. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, but because he had been poisoned so deeply, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 1:45 PM. The hospital reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate the circumstances of the deceased's suicide. Meanwhile, the body was transported by car to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for an autopsy. The case will be reported to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel to examine it.</p>
<h3>Gengxin Lane Rent Reduction Branch Established Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Telegram Reply to Zhide Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>Relief Funds Exhausted, Unable to Continue Allocation</p>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Zhide Bandit Disaster Relief Committee in Anhui, requesting allocation of relief funds and medicine. In addition to the 300 yuan that the association had already allocated, it is now unable to continue allocating funds due to the exhaustion of relief funds. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent in reply, saying, "Zhide Bandit Disaster Relief Committee, greetings. The telegram and two printed documents have been received. We are very willing to comply with your request to continue to assist in rescuing the disaster victims. However, our association's relief funds are extremely exhausted. The previous allocation of 300 yuan was already the best we could do. The funds for summer medicine raised this period were extremely small. Due to the drought and epidemic prevalent in various places, they have already been allocated completely and no longer exist. We are deeply sorry that our strength is not equal to our wish. We are sending this telegram in reply, hoping for your understanding. Xinwei Relief Association, Fish."</p>

<p>Rickshaw Puller Angry Wife Doesn't Return</p>
<h3>Self-Harm by Undressing in Court</h3>
<p>Stabbing Chest with Knife, Blood Flows Freely</p>
<p>Egg Means Rolling Away Pear Means Separation</p>
<p>丨Rickshaw Puller Says Wife Intended to Flee丨</p>
<p>Yang Chaoyuan, 24 years old, from Funing, lives in a shed on Gonghe Road and makes a living pulling a rickshaw. Last October, he married Ms. Xu, a fellow villager and adopted daughter of Qian Guoyan (who raised her after she lost her parents). Ms. Xu is 17 years old. They married on February 5th of the lunar calendar this year. After arriving, she often returned to Ning for various reasons. Yang Chaoyuan repeatedly dissuaded her, but not only did she not listen, she intensified her actions, sometimes not returning until late. As a result, the couple's relationship was broken. In early May, Ms. Xu returned to her mother's home again. Every time she left and returned, his attempts were ineffective. Yang Chaoyuan is a coolie who finds it difficult to marry a wife. He often tells people that it cost him more than 400 yuan to marry Ms. Xu, resulting in a mountain of debt. This time, she left without saying goodbye, and he couldn't find her. It was like releasing a white dove. Therefore, he hired someone to write a complaint and filed a lawsuit against Xu Guoyan and Ms. Xu for handing over the person. Yesterday morning, Judge He Jingxian specially opened the fourth court to hear the case. Xu Guoyan was absent, and only Ms. Xu appeared in court, claiming that her daughter was beaten and driven out by Yang Chaoyuan and did not return home. Yang Chaoyuan then testified about what had happened before. He was filled with anger and immediately took out a knife (a foot knife) from his sleeve and undressed in court, stabbing his chest deeply. Blood flowed freely. The judge caught sight of this and quickly ordered the court bailiffs to take the knife away and take him to the prosecutor's office for sealing. After the prosecutor examined him, because the injury was not light, he immediately ordered him to be sent to the hospital for treatment. The knife was confiscated. According to Yang Chaoyuan, Ms. Xu fled before she had been married for 100 days. Before Ms. Xu left, she claimed that her mother gave her an egg when she entered the door (thinking that after 100 days of marriage, the egg would roll away), and used a knife to split a pear (referring to a sign of separation), and cut an onion with a knife (meaning that cutting an onion with a knife is empty at both ends), and put a piece of fresh meat skin into Ms. Xu's pocket and carried it with her when she entered the door (meaning that she could treat her husband like a pig). All of this proves that she had premeditated thoughts and planned to escape. But we poor people are being fooled like this, and both our spirits and money are damaged. It is painful to talk about, so it is better to die than to suffer.</p>
<p>Biological Father</p>
<h3>Knife Cuts Biological Child</h3>
<p>Eight Children Born, None Survived</p>
<p>Uninformed Laborer Acts Cruelly</p>
<p>In the wasteland at the entrance of Yongqing Lane, Xiaosha Ferry Road, Shanghai West, at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, a newborn baby boy, about six months old, wrapped in diapers, was suddenly found crying loudly. He was discovered by passers-by. The child was lying in a pool of blood and was immediately reported to the nearby Putuo Road Police Station. Detective Tan Jinhai was dispatched to investigate. The child had knife marks all over his body. There were a total of eight cuts on his face, abdomen, hands, legs, and other parts. The child was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His life was in great danger. After investigation, it was found that the child was born to Yang Yulou, a laborer at the Fufeng Flour Mill at No. 30 Beiyinghua Lane, Robert Sheng Road. Yang was immediately taken to the police station. According to Yang, he and his wife had produced eight children, all of whom died prematurely. None of them survived. This child (the one who was cut) was six months old and suddenly became seriously ill. Therefore, he angrily used a kitchen knife to cut the child eight times, thinking that he was dead, and threw him into the wasteland. He believed that this child had come to collect debts again, since he had not been able to keep any of the eight children he had had. It is a great wonder that he did not die after being stabbed eight times. The police station, because Yang's intentions were vicious and he committed the crime of murder, immediately transferred Yang to the First Special District Court for investigation. The child was left in Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Forging Court Summons</h3>
<p>Purpose is to Vent Anger</p>
<p>Result is Getting Caught in the Net of the Law</p>
<p>Zhou Genxing, a Guangdong native residing at No. 6, Qipu Road, recently fell in love with Miao Ying, the daughter of Ms. He Wu of No. 35, Tiantong Road, and lived together. They had a child. Unexpectedly, He's feelings for Zhou suddenly broke down, and in January of this year, she took the child back to her hometown, without a trace. Zhou was anxious and often went to her place to make a fuss, asking her to hand over Miao Ying and his son. However, Ms. He Wu ignored him. In anger, Zhou said that he would sue in court, but fearing that he would not achieve his goal and lose money, and since he was an electrician at the Xieqiao General Assembly on Jing'an Temple Road, he heard that his friend Shou Arong had obtained a summons from the Civil Court of the First Special Court in a money debt case. Zhou then borrowed it and took it to Jiatai Printing House at No. 364, Tiantong Road, and asked his colleague Ding Can, a native of Changzhou, to imitate and print 100 identical fake summons, costing 1 yuan and 8 cents. He asked his colleague Zhu Chengxiang, a tea servant from Shaoxing, to fill in a lawsuit case of Zhou Genxing suing He Miaoying, asking her to go to court to resolve the matter. One summons was also delivered by his colleague Liu Ahai, a tea servant from Ningbo. The case was discovered by Zhao Bingkun, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, who arrested Zhou and the other three and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning. Upon clear instructions, they were ordered to await sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan came to court and announced the sentence.</p>

<p>Defrauding Copper Coins</p>
<h3>18,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>A Moment's Greed Causes Lifelong Harm</p>
<p>Years of Reputation Lost in an Instant</p>
<p>Sun Yushun, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 12, Anlin Lane, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, is 56 years old. He operates Baotai Cigarette Paper Store on Min Guo Road in the French Concession, employing Ye Changshan as manager and Sun Xintang as accountant. He also operates Zhonghua Bathhouse on Shanxi Road, employing Wang Tingzhi as manager, and Dongfang Hotel on Min Guo Road, managed by Chu Lianke. Sun has been trading copper coins with the French Tram Company in Lujiawan for six years. The company, because Sun has multiple stores and a good reputation, has been quite trusting. However, on June 17th of this year, after Sun received 18,000 yuan in copper coins from the Tram Company, he issued a promissory note from Baotai. Immediately, Sun colluded with Ye and Sun to close the store and divide the money, fleeing with it. After learning of this, the Tram Company reported it to the French police, requesting a joint arrest warrant. On the one hand, the Tram Company found out that Sun Yushun had Zhonghua Bathhouse and Dongfang Hotel, and immediately went to negotiate. The managers of the two stores allowed them to pay compensation in full. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the special task force inspector of the French police, Jin Jiulin, detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, and deputy detectives Yang Yilong and Bao Tan Wu Wengang, found the third defendant Sun Xintang hiding in the Daji Cigarette Paper Store at No. 1430, Aiduya Road, and immediately rushed there and arrested Sun. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi said that the police still needed to investigate the case and requested a postponement. Liu Changyin, the comprador of the Tram Company, sent representative Xu Jingshan to the case to clarify the case. After Judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession and questioned Sun Xinben, he approved the postponement for another trial. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>A Bomb in a Trash Can</h3>

<p>Lu Afu's Face Blasted</p>
<p>No. 5 Lianyi Lane, Daji Road outside Ximen, is the home of Dr. Xu Zhongen of Tongren Hospital. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, male servant Lu Afu, 24 years old, from Tongzhou, was splitting a watermelon in the middle of the hall. After the family finished eating the watermelon, Afu collected the watermelon rinds and everything else and carried them out to pour into the trash can at the entrance of the lane. Unexpectedly, there was a bomb stored in the can. When the watermelon rinds were poured in, there was a loud bang, the bomb exploded, and iron shards flew, severely injuring his face, chest, arms, and other parts on the spot. After falling to the ground unconscious, he was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by someone.</p>

<p>Overturning the Confession of the Original Trial</p>
<p>Ding Yinshi, a woman from Wuxi and the owner of Ding Juxing Iron Shop at No. 658, Xiaosha Ferry Road, Shanghai West, had a 13-year-old only son named Ding Fugen who was studying at the Baxianqiao Franco-Chinese School.

<p>Former Comprador of Jardine Matheson</p>
<h3>Luo Buzhou Falsely Accuses Sister-in-Law of Theft Case</h3>
<p>Travels Far to Shanghai to Visit, is Falsely Accused of Theft and Arrested by Police</p>
<p>Widowed Sister-in-Law is Unwilling and Files Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>丨Two Trials Announced Verdict Yesterday丨</p>
<p>Luo Buzhou (aka Luo Guangying), a native of Xiakou, Hubei, who previously served as a comprador for the British trading company Jardine Matheson in Xiaguan, Nanjing, has been living in a Western-style house at No. 850 Yuyuan Road in this port since retiring from his position as a comprador, enjoying a life of luxury. Luo had an older brother named Ziyuan, who passed away in the winter of 1930. His widowed sister-in-law, Luo Chen Yuzhen, requested that Buzhou divide the jointly owned property, but Buzhou refused. Therefore, Luo Chen filed civil and criminal lawsuits separately in the Hankou District Court. However, Buzhou consistently refused to appear in court, so the lawsuits have been unable to proceed. However, Luo Chen is feeling increasingly distressed and struggling to raise her orphaned child because the property has not been divided.</p>
<p>Recently, she personally went to Buzhou's residence to negotiate the public property issue. She was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by Buzhou, who accused Luo Chen of being a thief. The police station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to arrest her. It was then found out that it was a domestic dispute, and she was released. However, Luo Chen was very unwilling to suffer this false accusation and hired lawyers Fan Gang, Lou Ying, and Luo Jiaheng to file a criminal self-accusation against Luo Buzhou in the First Special District District Court, stating that the late husband Ziyuan and the defendant were brothers and had joint property that had not been divided. Unfortunately, Ziyuan passed away. The defendant had sinister intentions and forced the plaintiff's underage son, Mingxiao, to sign his name while the plaintiff was escorting the coffin back to Han for burial. The plaintiff had filed a criminal self-accusation in the Hankou District Court, but it had not been concluded because the defendant was hiding and failing to appear. The plaintiff then thought that they were close relatives and should not continue the lawsuit, and planned to meet with the defendant to explain everything. She once sent her son and daughter-in-law to Shanghai to visit the defendant this spring to convey this message. However, they were turned away. The plaintiff had no choice but to come in person. Since she was unfamiliar with the place, she asked Ms. Ye, who was living with her, to accompany her to the defendant's residence, knock on the door, and request a meeting to state her intentions. Unexpectedly, the defendant not only refused to let her in for a face-to-face meeting, but also privately reported to the police station, falsely accusing the plaintiff of being a robber. The police station, based on the report, immediately ordered detectives to take the plaintiff to the case. The plaintiff asked Luo Guangying</p>
<p>to go to the police station</p>
<p>for questioning at the same time. The detectives said that Luo Guangying reported that you were a robber and should first go to the police station to await investigation. The plaintiff had no choice but to go and be detained. Only after being questioned did the plaintiff explain in detail that she and the defendant were uncle and sister-in-law, and that she had come to visit this time to discuss family matters. She was then released. The defendant falsely accused the plaintiff of being a robber, intending to put her to death in order to achieve his grand plan of encroaching on the joint property. Judging from his behavior, he should be convicted of the crime under Article 180 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff is a weak woman and is living in a foreign land without any support. The defendant is the younger brother of the plaintiff's deceased husband. If he had a conscience, how should he protect her? Now, he is</p>
<p>falsely accusing his sister-in-law of theft</p>
<p>because of his greed for money. His heart is so cruel that it is unparalleled in the world. Therefore, she was forced to file a self-accusation, hoping that the case would be quickly investigated, the punishment would be strictly enforced, and that the law would be upheld. After being accused, Luo also hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to submit a statement defending himself, denying that he reported the plaintiff to the police as a thief at the time. He only said that someone came to his house to make a fuss and filed a counterclaim against Luo Chen, saying that she intended to intimidate and extort money. The First Special Court had already summoned him once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened a court session to continue the trial and summoned the Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station who handled the case as witnesses. Judge Wu then questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant in detail about the verbal arguments between the two parties on the 15th and 17th of last month, as well as the process of the defendant reporting to the police. The lawyers from both sides then debated with each other until the end, and the court immediately announced that both Luo Buzhou and Luo Chen Yuzhen were innocent.</p>
<p>On the side of the residence, in the cotton field, he was killed. Later, detectives from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau first arrested the suspect Zhou Ah Yuan from Jiangyin in Shanghai. On the evening of the 29th of the same month, they arrested the main culprit Wang Deyu (26 years old, the deceased's uxorilocal brother) at the Nanyang Quanji Restaurant and brought him to the bureau for interrogation. After investigating, the French police found that the starting point for the deceased being lured out was in the French Concession, so they immediately sent detectives to the Public Security Bureau to transfer the two criminals, Zhou and Wang, to their custody for investigation. They were transferred to the Second Special District District Court and prosecuted for the crime of premeditated murder. At the end of the trial, Wang Deyu was sentenced to death for murder, and Zhou Ah Yuan was found not guilty. Wang Deyu, dissatisfied with the verdict, submitted a statement to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court to file an appeal. The details have been reported in the previous newspapers. The Higher Court approved the appeal and opened an investigation court, summoning detectives from the Shanghai and Nanyang Public Security Bureaus, as well as the waiter from the Quanji Restaurant and the police officer in charge of the case, to be interrogated. The day before yesterday, the criminal court Guo Dezhang, together with judges Sun Honglin and Fan Peien, and prosecutor Zhang, opened a joint court to hear the appeal. According to the appellant Wang's statement of appeal reasons, he overturned the confession from the original trial and said that he had no feud with the deceased. Even if he had property, I could not seize it. Even if I killed him, I would not be able to obtain his property. Why should I kill him? The death of Ding Fugen was actually caused by his brother-in-law Tang Ajin. The court verified the confession and ordered a re-examination with scheduled witness summons. The appellant was still detained pending instructions.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Asks 工部局</p>
<h3>To Stop Illegal Charges by Water Company</h3>
<p>Taiping Fire Hydrant Fee Increased Fivefold</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession wrote to the工部局 yesterday, saying, "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Fen Yu Company, 'Our property, Weishui Lane on Zhejiang Road, was forced to dig an artesian well to supply water to the tenants due to repeated increases in water charges, so as to avoid being oppressed. However, the company does not realize that its arbitrary increase is unreasonable, but instead becomes jealous and deliberately makes things difficult. It has increased the annual water fee for the three Taiping fire hydrants set up in the lane from the original price of five yuan per hydrant to twenty-five yuan, an increase of five times the previous water fee. Moreover, the lane is located between Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, Niuzhuang Road, and Guangxi Road, with outlets on all four sides. The 工部局 has already installed more than five public Taiping fire hydrants in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng Urgently Requests</p>
<h3>Central Government Grants Amnesty to Liu Chongwu</h3>
<p>Because his hatred of treacherous merchants was an act of patriotic fervor.</p>
<p>And will gift Liu ten silver dollars from the sales of anti-Japanese calligraphy and paintings.</p>
<p>Major General Jiang Minsheng of the Northeast Volunteer Army, responding to requests from schools in Zhejiang Province to recount the experiences of resisting Japan in the Northeast, left Shanghai for Zhejiang last month (June).  Many places eagerly requested him to speak. It is now known that a letter was entrusted to the Wenhua Bookstore Company in this city to be forwarded to the Patriotic Volunteers Support Association in this city for the sake of the patriotic volunteers Liu Chongwu and others.  The recent second trial by the Higher Court Second Branch seemed to be still too harsh. The letter requests the association to make a reasonable request to the government for amnesty, thereby enhancing the patriotic sentiment of the people. The original text is as follows: "To whom it may concern, we have repeatedly seen in the newspapers that patriotic volunteers Liu Chongwu and others were imprisoned for their anger at treacherous merchants selling Japanese goods. This retrial, although legally correct in its judgment, is far from humane.  The national law is originally based on human sentiment and common sense to determine the truth of the matter. In this case, there was no premeditated murder, nor was it motivated by private resentment. Their hatred of treacherous merchants was clearly driven by patriotic fervor.  According to their actions, it is not comparable to ordinary cases.  It is imperative to make a reasonable request to the central government for amnesty, in order to encourage people to love the country, so that general treacherous merchants will refrain from their misconduct.  We hope that your association will provide assistance.  Minsheng respectfully entrusts the remaining ten silver dollars from the sale of anti-Japanese calligraphy and paintings to be handed over to the incarcerated patriots."</p>
<p>X  X  X  X</p>
<p>If the unforeseen occurs, the water supply is more than sufficient for firefighting. The lane occupies six mu of land, with north-south access and a main alleyway. According to the area, the distance from the center to the road is only a little over ten zhang.  According to regulations, there is no need to have its own Taiping dragon head (fire hydrant). More than ten years ago, our company rebuilt the houses to ensure the safety of the tenants, and installed the hydrant as a precautionary measure. Upon investigation, in the past years, when there were fires in the shops in this lane, the fire brigade came to the scene twice and always drew water from the roadside, while our own fire hydrant was never used. Therefore, the fees paid by our company over the years are no different from gifts to the water company. The company, without using its water, has increased the water reserve fee fivefold for the nominal Taiping dragon head, which is akin to extortion and cannot be acknowledged.  The company often bullies people by relying on its power and has recently instigated the Fire Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Council to send letters on its behalf to demand payment. We do not know what reasons the company has for making such requests. Is the Shanghai Municipal Council the bill collector for the water company? Our company has dug a well and does not need to use its water. Does the water company want to recover the cost of its water from those who do not use it? Therefore, we report the situation truthfully, hoping that your association will forward a letter to the Fire Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Council to question them, so as to prevent unreasonable harassment. It is not only our company, but also the residents of the settlement who will benefit from it," etc. The association has received the information and respectfully requests you to investigate and take action to stop illegal and unreasonable actions.</p>

<p>Shanghai-Qingdao Special Flight</p>
<p>The company, in view of the extremely hot weather and to facilitate those who are professionally bound and cannot easily obtain a long period of leave from Shanghai to escape the summer heat, has specially opened a Shanghai-Qingdao summer special flight, with round trips between Qingdao and Shanghai once every Saturday and Sunday. Those who usually have official duties and cannot travel far from Shanghai can take advantage of their Saturday and Sunday holidays to fly to Qingdao for a one-day and one-night tour, and return to Shanghai the next day. It has now been decided to start implementing this from this week. Those who have booked seats for the flight are very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Chenxing Shines Brightly Last Night</h3>
<p>Shanghai Pudong Electric Company, in response to the needs of Chenxing, Tijiqiao, Tangkou, and other towns and townships in the Shanghai County area of the mainland, as well as the Central River area in Nanhui, has installed electric lights to promote industry and benefit commerce. The company had previously sent a letter to Xing Zhigang of the Fifth District Office, requesting him to persuade the people to assist in the construction of the poles in the farmland. The wiring was completed the day before yesterday. Last night, Chenxing and other towns and townships were lit up, greatly brightening the city's appearance.</p>
<p>Huang Jianbai, a Chinese National</p>
<h3>Invents "New Boat" for Water Transportation</h3>
<p>Safe and with extremely shallow draft</p>
<p>Actively manufacturing in a factory in Shanghai</p>
<p>Huang Jianbai, a native of Hunan Province, has been working at the Guanghua Electric Light Factory in Hunan. Recently, he has been very interested in the shipbuilding industry and has invented a type of "New Boat" for water transportation. Its shape is similar to an airship, travels very fast, and is very safe. The ship is 94 feet long, about 17 feet wide, and 5 feet high, with a displacement of 30 tons and a weight of 30 tons. It uses 106 rectangular floating boxes made of light metal alloy, which are arranged around the bottom and back of the ship from head to tail, supporting the hull. The bottom of the ship is about 6 inches above the water. The test results show that although the speed of the ship is not as fast as an airship, it is extremely safe and labor-saving, and its draft is very shallow, making it most suitable for sailing in inland harbors. He has already applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration. Currently, many people in Hunan Province are purchasing them. Mr. Huang wrote to a friend in Shanghai yesterday, planning to set up a large-scale manufacturing plant in Shanghai to actively manufacture them in order to expand the sales scope.</p>

<p>Negotiations over the Case of French Soldiers Assaulting Shop Owner</p>
<h3>Guaranteeing that the same incident will not happen again.</h3>
<p>The culprit is currently detained at the French military headquarters.</p>
<p>"Xin Sheng She" reports that the situation regarding the case of French soldiers assaulting a Chinese person the night before is quite serious. Three soldiers from the French military camp at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet went to the "Coffee King" snack bar at No. 73 Hualong Road at around 9 PM the night before, drank a bottle of beer, and left without paying. The owner, Sheng Gongxu, asked them for payment. The soldiers became enraged and brutally beat Mr. Sheng, causing injuries. The police arrived and took the soldiers to the Lokawei Police Station. Mr. Sheng is a highly educated person and currently serves as a design committee member of the National Government's Construction Committee and a professor at Shanghai French Law School. This morning, Mr. Sheng took his injury certificate from Guangci Hospital and went to the Lokawei Police Station to negotiate. He later learned that the soldiers had been transferred to the French military headquarters on Rue du Consulat. He went to the headquarters again to negotiate, demanding punishment for the perpetrators, compensation, and a guarantee that the same incident would not happen again in the settlement. However, there has been no result yet. According to Mr. Sheng, the fact that he was beaten is not something to be alarmed about, but he believes that this matter concerns the safety of Chinese people in the settlement and also concerns national dignity. He is determined to negotiate seriously and will not easily let it go.</p>

<h3>Enjoying Lotus Flowers in the Hot Summer at Yu Garden</h3>
<p>In the countryside about one mile west of Kunshan Station and east of Zhenyi Station along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, there is a place called "East Pavilion". Because there is a lotus pond there, the lotus flowers that bloom are unusually precious, including double lotus flowers or four-faced Guanyin (with four flowers blooming on each stem). Recently, descendants of the Gu family, along with Ye Gongchuo and Ren Xiaoshan, initiated the renovation of the lotus pond and the East Pavilion, preserving a historical site called "Gu Garden East Pavilion Lotus Pond". It was completed last month. The pond management committee invited people from all walks of life to visit the countryside. It is now known that the flowers in the pond are blooming profusely this year. In addition to the blooming double lotus flowers and four-faced Guanyin, there are also flowers with six lotus flowers blooming on each stem. Therefore, in recent days, people from Suzhou, Kunshan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places who love famous flowers have been flocking to visit, braving the heat.</p>

Then, everyone raised their glasses to congratulate the new chairman, and the atmosphere was lively.</p>
<h3>West City Business Community Rent Reduction Meeting</h3>
<p>Organizing a meeting to promote the resolution of various key issues.</p>
<p>The shops along Zhonghua Road, Fangxie Road, Heping Road, and Zhaojiabang Road in the Nanshi area feel that business is declining and the situation is not good. The burden of rent is particularly difficult to bear. Since the reconstruction of houses and the widening of roads in Ximen, the market appears to be prosperous on the surface, so the landlords are raising rents. However, the shops are generally operating poorly, and they are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. It is now known that rent reduction movements are actively underway in various places. In order to promote the early realization of rent reduction in a unified manner, the West City shops held a West City Business Community Rent Reduction Promotion Conference at the Mingyuan Restaurant in the area yesterday at 2:00 PM. Here is a summary of various news:</p>
<p>West City Business Community Rent Reduction Promotion Conference. The West City Business Community Rent Reduction Promotion Conference was officially held at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 representatives from the business community attended. Cao Mo, Feng Xueqiao, and Lu Hanjun were publicly elected as the presidium, and Ding Songan was the recorder. After the formalities, Chairman Cao Mo first reported the purpose of the meeting and the significance of the business community's demand for rent reduction. Then, Wang Shenqing, Tong Shijie, Li Sen, Gao Zixin, Huang Lianfu, Gu Zhenxin, Zhao Taidian, Wang Shaoqin, and others successively expressed their opinions. The chairman summarized the various opinions and resolved to pass various action plans, including (1) organizing a rent reduction promotion association, (2) carrying out rent registration for commercial shops and having the association prepare a form, (3) determining the standard for rent reduction in accordance with the regulations of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, (4) issuing a declaration from the business community demanding rent reduction, (5) posting various rent reduction slogans, (6) investigating the names of local landlords and owners in order to send letters to them separately to persuade them to reduce rent automatically, (7) deciding not to pay rent if the rent is not reduced and depositing the original rent in a designated bank, (8) hiring lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Li Ming to form a legal advisory group, (9) all shops should join the West City Business Community Federation to request assistance with rent reduction, and (10) publishing the West City Commercial News to promote the rent reduction movement. The above methods were all approved, and 21 executive committee members were elected on the spot. All expenses will be decided by the executive committee. The office will be located within the West City Business Community Federation, and meetings will be held once a week. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The merchants in the area of Chen Ying Shi Ta Nan continued to hold a meeting. The merchants in the area of Chen Ying Shi Nan Ba on Zhonghua and Fangxie Roads were forced to collect rent by Zhuang Xianghe, who hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan, because they had asked for rent reduction. Therefore, the shops continued to hold a meeting the night before to discuss countermeasures. All attendees were present. Cao Mo was publicly elected as the chairman. He reported that the previous letter from all the tenants requesting the landlord to reduce the rent had expired, but he was still ignoring it. They discussed how to deal with it. The agreed methods were: (1) The landlord's failure to respond is equivalent to tacitly agreeing to the rent reduction, which can also be used as evidence in law. (2) According to the reports of the tenants, the landlord privately persuaded the other seven tenants, willing to reduce the rent by 10%, but not willing to cooperate with Cao. The rent reduction is a whole issue, not an issue of individuals. It should be denied to avoid the landlord's alienation and sabotage of unity. (3) The tenants are willing to sign a covenant of alliance to express their determination. If there is a violation, they are willing to accept punishment. (4) If the landlord is not sincere in reducing the rent, they will deposit the rent due in the Shanghai City Bank from now on. (5) The legal advisor, lawyer Li Ming, will reply to lawyer Wang Chengkuan, detailing the reasons for not paying the rent. (6) Participate in the West City Business Community Rent Reduction Promotion Conference in its entirety. (7) Set aside 10% of the original rent as funds for negotiations. (8) Issue a declaration announcing that the landlord is oppressing the tenants and collecting excessive rent, and ask for assistance from all walks of life. The above methods were discussed and the meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Branch Establishes United Public Bureau</h3>
<p>Wuxi has always been known as a model industrial zone. The market is prosperous and is the best in the interior. Therefore, the transportation of goods has always relied on steamships as the main body. However, in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt and all industries have declined, resulting in a sharp decline in steamship business. It is difficult to maintain without cooperation. Under the guidance of Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lidun, Chen Bogang, Qian Sunqing, and other leaders of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau and the shipping industry, a United Public Bureau has been established at No. 9 Laozha Street, North Suzhou Road. Its business offices are still located at the original addresses of Xie Xing Gong Mao Taichang. In the future, regardless of wind or rain, there will be daily departures. It is said that the business policy after cooperation will be to strive for safety and speed for passengers and goods, and to strive for fairness and uniformity in freight rates. Wuxi merchants all say it is convenient.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the OK Lock Factory</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the invitation of Manager He Xiyu of Wanhua Hardware Industry Factory, I visited the factory. The factory is located at No. 121 Wenjian Shi Road, which is the most convenient area for transportation. It specializes in the manufacture of pin tumbler door locks and various hardware daily necessities. In recent years, China's industries have been mostly occupied by foreign goods, and the hardware industry is particularly bad, resulting in people's hardship. Mr. He was deeply worried about this and planned to gather comrades to plug the loopholes. It happened that his close friends, Mr. Chen Zhisheng and Mr. Deng Chaochang, also had this idea. Mr. Chen and Mr. Deng have always attached great importance to the mechanical department and have more than 20 years of experience. Therefore, they worked together to set up this factory. The initial capital was set at 30,000 yuan. Later, during the January 28 Incident, due to the impact of the war, Mr. He advanced another 10,000 yuan to complete it. Starting a business is indeed not easy. Therefore, I drove there at 3:00 PM. As soon as I entered, I was warmly received by Mr. Chen and Mr. Deng, who guided me to visit the various departments. The workers were working separately and were extremely busy. The factory is divided into three floors. The lower floor is the repair department and the pressing, shearing, turning, planing, milling, polishing, and key printing departments. The second floor is the drilling, key tooth, spring winding, pin tumbler assembly, painting, inspection, and packaging departments. The third floor is the staff's bedroom. The layout is orderly and well-organized. The assembly of pin tumblers is purely the responsibility of female employees, taking into account their carefulness and responsibility. According to statistics, the factory has more than 60 large and small machines. The lock parts are all made by machine, so they are very accurate. There are also several automatic machines that do not require human supervision. The structure is ingenious and not found in other factories. Except for the lathe and planer, which are ordered from foreign merchants, the rest of the machines are made with ingenious ideas and self-made, suitable for the use of the products. Therefore, there are not many people used, and each hour can produce a dozen steel shell pin tumbler door locks. Then, he took out several kinds of lock samples to show, including seven types: full copper, steel shell chrome plated, steel shell antique bronze plated, steel shell painted, steel shell baked, iron shell antique bronze plated, and iron shell baked. Registered with the OK trademark, the production is excellent, and it is more than enough to compete with imported goods. For example, the full copper pin tumbler door lock is the first invention of the factory, not afraid of rain erosion and rust, and is most suitable for shikumen (stone-framed gate houses) and all doors that cannot avoid rain. Each lock is only sold for 3.5 yuan. Another example is the steel shell pin tumbler door lock, which is only sold for 2 yuan per lock. The key has more than 100,000 different numbers and is indeed worthy of the honor of being good and cheap. Therefore, major hardware stores and major department stores are happy to promote it. Last month, the Hu brothers, overseas Chinese merchants from Nanyang, visited the factory and praised it endlessly. I heard that the factory also has many kinds of commercially necessary products that have been carefully researched and are being made, and they will be released soon. The Hu brothers will also join and expand the operation, so that they can take the lead in the industrial and commercial world in the future.</p>
<h3>The World's Heaviest Woman Will Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will not come to China again in the next few years.</p>
<p>The world's heaviest woman, who is currently performing on the second floor of Sincere Company, has such well-developed golden flesh that it is amazing. People who come to see her are rushing to be the first and are endless. A large number of people even wait by the side of the door when the company closes, thinking that it is a pleasure to see the plump charm of the dark fat woman. It is now heard that the fat woman received a telegram from her brother in the United States yesterday, inviting her to come back to the country at the invitation of a major American hospital. She said that she will not come to China again in the next few years.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Trade Association Meetings</h3>
<p>The National Medicine Trade Association, concerning the Yunxian Jinjiang Fritillaria Sales Cooperative, breaking contracts and engaging in monopolistic practices that have resurfaced, causing panic in the market due to insufficient supply. Member reports have been flooding in for days. Furthermore, the Municipal National Medicine Association, unable to stand idly by as the national medicine industry is struck a blow, has expressed its intention to uphold justice. Simultaneously, with the city government taking over alcohol tax collection, national medicine stores selling medicated wine are also subjected to heavy taxation, which deviates from the original intent of the alcohol tax. There is an urgent need to fight for justice based on reason. Therefore, at 3 PM yesterday, the 13th emergency joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees was convened to discuss solutions. All committee members attended, and Guo Boliang, Shen Xinjiu, and Jiang Wenfang, three committee members from the Municipal National Medicine Association, were invited to attend. Cen Zhiliang chaired the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: (1) The National Medicine Association requested this association to nominate five representatives to participate in the special committee. It was resolved to nominate Gao Zhiwen, Cen Zhiliang, Cen Binghuang, Zhuang Meitang, and Qiu Yanling. (2) How to deal with the Yunxian Jinjiang Fritillaria Sales Cooperative breaking contracts and engaging in monopolistic practices? Resolved (Secret). (3) The nature of medicated wine sold by national medicine stores is entirely different from that of those purely for intoxication. Now being subjected to the same license tax is a deviation from the meaning of license taxes on tobacco and alcohol. How should this be handled? Resolved, to submit a petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Municipal Government, arguing based on reason and requesting a full exemption to alleviate the hardships of businesses.</p>
<p>The Wine and Restaurant Trade Association convened its third standing committee meeting on August 5, 1934. Zhu Ligong chaired the meeting, and the issue of increasing liquor licenses for the autumn of this year was discussed. According to letters from Drunken Goose Tower, Great Celebration Hall, and other members, they have paid taxes and registered for licenses in accordance with regulations, and temporary receipts were issued at the time, with a deadline for exchange. When they went to the Nanshi Tax Collection Office to exchange for licenses, they were withheld and faced numerous difficulties. Reluctantly, they requested intervention and relief, with attached receipts to the meeting. Based on this, the Ministry of Finance's Temporary Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax, Article 3, Class B, clearly stipulates that "other stores selling all kinds of alcohol" should pay four yuan of tax per quarter. These members have paid taxes and obtained licenses in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, and there is nothing inappropriate about it. However, the Tax Collection Office is making things difficult, which is truly perplexing. Furthermore, the economic situation in this city has been poor in recent years. Businesses still comply with the Ministry's regulations, but they are being made difficult, which is particularly unfair. All of our fellow businesses operate for the purpose of serving meals to merchants who come and go, with food as the main business. This cannot be compared to those who specialize in selling alcohol separately. The alcohol consumed by customers is, in fact, entirely purchased by the customers themselves from licensed hotels that have already paid taxes. They simply sit in the halls of the restaurants to drink, or the restaurants buy drinks for the customers on their behalf, with no profit to be made. Requiring another liquor license is simply redundant and clearly adds tax on top of tax. However, for the sake of the nation's revenue, businesses comply with regulations and obtain licenses, and paying four yuan of tax per quarter according to the Class B regulations is sufficient. It is the duty of businesses to pay taxes. The Tax Collection Office is increasing taxes on the grounds that businesses cannot accept the additional burden imposed outside of the regulations. It is respectfully requested that the Municipal Finance Bureau review the situation, consider the hardships of businesses, and order the Tax Collection Office to refrain from making things difficult and promptly issue licenses in accordance with regulations to maintain business operations. The petition is as follows: "Petition regarding liquor license tax, requesting exemption from difficulties in obtaining licenses by complying with the Ministry's regulations, Class B. The members of our association, Drunken Goose Tower Restaurant, located at No. 185 Fangbang Road, City, applied for tax payment and license in accordance with regulations. At the time, the tax payment was made to the Nanshi Tax Collection Office, and a temporary receipt was given, with the license to be issued after seven days. When they went to collect the license, it was withheld and faced numerous difficulties. Reluctantly, they requested relief, with an attached receipt. Based on this, the member, Drunken Goose Tower Restaurant, is considered an 'other store selling all kinds of alcohol' and has complied with the Ministry's regulations by paying taxes and obtaining a license in accordance with regulations, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, the Tax Collection Office did not issue the license and made all sorts of difficulties, which is particularly unfair. We have received a copy of the Municipal Finance Bureau's Temporary Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax, Article 3, Section 2, Class B, which stipulates that 'other stores selling all kinds of alcohol' should pay four yuan of tax per quarter, which is in line with the regulations. The wine and restaurant industry, i.e., restaurants, where alcohol is sold incidentally, is where the alcohol is entirely purchased by customers from licensed hotels that have already paid taxes, or the restaurants purchase drinks from taxed alcohol on behalf of the customers, in fact, without selling it themselves, and there is no profit to be made. Because the alcohol purchased is entirely purchased from licensed hotels that have already paid taxes, paying another license tax is redundant and a double tax. For the sake of the nation's revenue, our association complies with the regulations in Article 3, Section 2, Class B, which stipulates that 'other stores selling all kinds of alcohol' should pay four yuan of tax per quarter. It is the duty of the business community of the restaurant industry to pay taxes. Members of the Chinese community have repeatedly made the same requests and have come to the association to request assistance. Under these circumstances, it is not a violation of the Ministry's regulations. It is respectfully requested that the Municipal Bureau consider the hardships of businesses and grant the request, ordering all Tax Collection Offices that all restaurants selling wine should pay taxes and obtain licenses in accordance with the above Class B, paying four yuan of tax per quarter, and should not make things difficult, so as to maintain fairness and resolve disputes, which would be a great convenience. Respectfully submitted to Cai, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau." "The following is omitted."</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In your newspaper's "Local News" section on August 6, there was an article titled "Two Railroads Plan to Build Warehouses at Various Stations, Borrowing 15 Million." The Bureau has indeed been ordered by the Ministry to build warehouses at various stations, which is true. However, the matter of borrowing a huge sum of 15 million from five banks to build warehouses is completely untrue. It is likely a misunderstanding based on rumors. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction to avoid causing misunderstandings. Sincerely, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, August 6.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: I read the article "China Merchants Minsheng Jointly Establish Yangtze River Shipping Cooperative" in your newspaper's "New Shanghai" column on August 4, which stated that "China Merchants Bureau, due to the success of the Yangtze River cooperation, has entrusted Hengtai to undertake the China Merchants Chongqing Customs Brokerage, which has been suspended for a long time." Our firm has not undertaken the China Merchants Chongqing Customs Brokerage. It is feared that the information is inaccurate. We are writing to request a correction from your newspaper. Sincerely, Hengtai New Kee, August 6.</p>

<h3>Reading News</h3>

<p>(1) My Reading Method</p>
<p>(2) This Week's Broadcast</p>
<p>(3) Introduction to the Four Major Literary Magazines of North and South China</p>
<h3>My Reading Method by Wang Lansheng</h3>
<p>We read because we want to satisfy our desire for knowledge, because we want to gain sufficient strength to compete for survival in this society. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to the method of reading. Indeed, with a good method, it is easier to understand what we read. I will write down a few points about my reading method for my friends to refer to.</p>
<p>(1) Use Your Brain. When we get a book, we must use our brains to think about it. Thinking can lead to questions, so being good at questioning is the most important skill in reading. Mr. Liang Rengong said: "The way of learning must be through doubt, then new questions will arise, and with new questions, there will be research; with research, there will be new inventions." This is what people call using the brain when reading.</p>
<p>(2) Use Your Mouth. The common fault of people reading books is that they are unwilling to read aloud. It seems that they are a little embarrassed about the act of reading. The ancients said: "Read with the mouth, think with the heart." These two sentences mean that you should imitate with your mouth and think with your heart. If you can read a book fluently, you can become skilled. Also, you can imitate unconsciously, because there must be imitation before there is creation, so reading fluently is very important, especially when learning a foreign language.</p>
<p>(3) Use Your Hands. The benefit of using your hands is great. We should write down everything we learn from the books we read every day and keep it as a diary. After a few years, we can organize it and turn it into a valuable book. That is why Mr. Gu Tinglin's "Daily Knowledge Records" is so valuable and famous. Also, we must practice writing essays regularly. The more we practice, the better our writing will be.</p>
<p>If we want to be scholars or inventors, we must think with our brains, read with our mouths, and write with our hands. How many successful scholars in China and abroad have done otherwise?</p>
<p>This Week's Broadcast</p>
<p>(1) Last time, the article "How to Watch Movies" published in this column could not be published in full. Please forgive the readers.</p>
<p>(2) All letters from readers after this week will not be answered if they are not written using the reader communication slips prepared by this department. Readers who have not purchased communication slips should purchase them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Since the publication of the first collection of "Reading Questions and Answers," we have been encouraged by readers who do not dislike our simplicity. Until now, the first edition of 3,000 copies has long been sold out, and several letters are still received daily requesting to purchase it. In order to meet the readers' enthusiasm, we have rushed to compile the second collection, which will be available to readers soon.</p>
<p>Introduction to the Four Major Literary Magazines of North and South China</p>
<p>We have received many letters from readers who love literature, asking us to introduce one or two reliable publications that are worth reading, because the current literary publications are mixed. This task seems easy and very necessary, but in fact it is very difficult. It is still impossible to demand a publication that is readable in every article and substantial in every issue. Several famous literary magazines only occasionally publish something that is enough to satisfy readers to maintain their readership. So, what we want to declare first is that we hope readers will not be superstitious about a certain publication, but will use their own judgment to find the works they want to read from the more reliable publications. The following is a brief introduction to the contents of the latest issues of the four major literary magazines of North and South China:</p>
<p>The quality of the August issue of "Literature" is even better than the previous special issue. In terms of essays, Mao Dun's "On Bing Xin" and Chen Wangdao's "On Mass Language" can be called works with correct viewpoints and detailed explanations. In terms of creation, "Famine Relief Rice," "Farewell to a Guest in the Mountains," and "New Year's Day is Not Allowed to Cry" are all real records of social life and are worth reading.</p>
<p>The August issue of "Modern" is inferior to "Literature" in terms of both essays and creation. None of the essays are fresh and palatable, and only Zhang Tianyi's "Smile" is barely readable.</p>
<p>The contents of the third volume of "Literary Quarterly" are as varied as before. Especially the essays, all six essays are written from the attitude of a gentleman's entertainment. In terms of creation, the vegetable seller Tiao Yan and Lazy Donation are worth reading.</p>
<p>"Contemporary Literature" is a new publication that has just been published for two issues. This issue is more advanced than the first issue. In terms of essays, "Romanticism in Literature" is an article that cannot be missed. "Problems in Establishing Literary Criticism" and "Problems Regarding the Future of Poetry" provide readers with some concrete opinions on literary criticism and poetry. Although there are not many creations, each article is worth reading. The only shortcoming of this publication is that the book reviews are not good enough, but it is still a better publication.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Fragrant Shadows: Memoirs from the Qing Court</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The carriage walls were also painted with many colorful murals, but the content of the paintings was more focused on stories, and these stories were all taken from famous old Chinese novels or legends. For example, "Jiang Ziya Conferred Gods after Killing Generals," "Guan Yu Traveling a Thousand Miles Alone," and they also inspire people's loyalty and filial piety. Even the four large vases filled with fresh flowers were painted with such stories, and they were painted very delicately.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager was very fond of flowers. In addition to the four types of flowers in the four large vases, she had many small and exquisite vases! Each vase had a specially made mahogany frame, which was very delicately carved! They were placed randomly, one here and one there. The vases were also filled with some water, and then she would choose a few kinds of flowers and plants that she liked and have people cut off the long stems and insert them into the vases to soak. Therefore, this small court was almost full of the fragrance of flowers, and the colors of the flowers were exceptionally pleasing to the eye!</p>
<p>Apart from that small bedroom and this incomparably magnificent small court, the remaining space in the train was very limited. But at the rear end, there were also two small rooms, each the size of a dipper, separated. One room was for us female officials to rest in when it was not our turn to be on duty, so that we could respond to the Empress Dowager at any time. Behind this room, there was an even smaller room with only a small charcoal stove, which was specially prepared for the Empress Dowager's tea. The eunuch in charge of this matter was Zhang De, who was also the one who stood beside the Empress Dowager holding the bowl and serving dishes every time she had a meal. In fact, his status was already higher than others. He did not like to take on these small matters of preparing tea, and fortunately no one supervised him, so he could choose one or two more careful eunuchs from among the younger eunuchs to replace him in this task.

<h3>Noon on the Bund</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>When the big clock on the Jianghai Customs House struck twelve with a very melodious sound, although the sun was hanging high in the sky, the shadows of the patrolmen at the crossroads had completely shrunk to under their heavy leather shoes, and the asphalt pavement on the road had melted so much that walking on it felt like walking on a quilt. On the sidewalks below the tall buildings that stand tall along the Bund, foreigners, Chinese, men, women, poured out in large batches from the doors of every tall building. From south to north, from north to south, you squeezed me, I squeezed you.</p>
<p>In the center of the street were streetcars and cars, like shuttles, going from south to north and from north to south. Each car was crowded with people. Rickshaws and bicycles also carried people, busy weaving in between, decorating the scene. In the Huangpu River, ferries were busy carrying passengers from Pudong to Puxi and from Puxi to Pudong. Square-headed ferries and sampans were also transporting passengers from east to west and from west to east like falling leaves.</p>
<p>These people are not afraid to toil in the hot sun, for the sake of going back to fill the stomachs that are singing the empty city strategy. These people are said to be the brave warriors who have created Shanghai's prosperity and greatness. But on the Huangpu Beach, there is another class of people who have been forgotten by the general public. Although the big clock on the Jianghai Customs House has struck twelve times, and although their stomachs are also singing the empty city strategy, they are still shouting "Yes Sir" in the strong sunlight, selling their labor. But they don't count as meritorious people who have contributed to Shanghai's prosperity.</p>
<h3>Lord Lang and Investiture of the Gods</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>I used to look through many books for the old Lord Lang Bodhisattva. One theory is that the old Lord Lang is the Guan Kou Erlang in Investiture of the Gods, which is not credible. This is entirely because the sounds of the words "old" and "two" are similar, so people have made far-fetched guesses. And there is no definite answer to the question of Erlang himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Renqiu has been to Guan Kou. That place is often gloomy, so the locals say "Guan never has sunny days." Renqiu said: "Because the yin energy of the snow mountain is strong." There is a City God Temple on the Snow Mountain, which enshrines Erlang. According to him, there are three theories about Erlang: "One says it is Meng Chang, that is, the slingshot immortal Zhang Xian, who was later divided into the God of Culture and Water; one says he is the nephew of the Jade Emperor; one says he is the immortal Yang Jian from the early Zhou Dynasty, all of which are baseless claims. He Yuanzhang once奏 (zou, memorialize) to correct it, and later it was said to be the son of Li Bing, which is also baseless. The court thought that the three-eyed appearance was awe-inspiring and had been a long-standing matter, so it could not be corrected. Now he is塑 (su, sculpted) as a handsome young man, and the strange appearance is covered with a curtain. One day, it will become a fabricated canon, which is not as ancient and elegant as the nephew of the Jade Emperor."</p>
<p>He Nuanzhang was probably He Zizhen; Zi Zhai was from Daozhou. Guan Kou belonged to Chengdu, Sichuan. I don't know what缘 (yuan, fate) it was that he奏 (zou, memorialize) to request correction. Some people say that Zhang Xian is Meng Chang, the lord of Shu, which is naturally not related to Erlang. As for the nephew and the immortal from the early Zhou Dynasty, they are all based on Investiture of the Gods, which shows that the impact of novels on society is very large.</p>
<p>Speaking of Investiture of the Gods, no one knew who the author was originally. In recent years, Sun Kaidi saw the Ming edition of Investiture of the Gods in the Cabinet Library in Japan, which was titled "Written by Xu Zhonglin." Only then was the four-hundred-year-old puzzle broken. Zhonglin was from Yingtian Prefecture, Nanjing, and his courtesy name was Zhongshan Yisou. Unfortunately, his history is unknown.</p>
<h3>The Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32 General Merriment Day and Night; Crying Soldiers Return</p>
<p>When he said this, his tone was very high, as if he was very confident about this matter. Gui Zhi also hoped that Ziqiang had not gone to the hospital. The next morning, she still let Zhao Weng go out to inquire about the news. From that day on, Zhao Weng had nothing else to do. As soon as he opened his eyes, he went out to inquire about his son's whereabouts. It was not until the fourth day that he felt that he could not find out anything. He lay in bed, crying secretly, and fell into a daze, too lazy to get up. The Zhao family continued their usual work these days. In addition to inquiring from all relevant parties, they also had to buy a few newspapers to read. Although they could not find any news in the newspapers, they were still reluctant to give up reading the newspapers. Sure enough, they found some clues today. The newspaper reported that there was a wounded company commander in the hospital who came from Ping'an Fort. Gui Zhi had been waiting for news every day and was also a little anxious. At this time, she did not have time to notify Zhao Weng. She took a rickshaw and went straight to the battlefield hospital to inquire. As soon as she got out of the car, she saw a middle-aged woman with three children, talking to a gate guard at the hospital gate. Gui Zhi had seen her twice in the past year and recognized her clearly. This was Guan Yaowu's wife, who was also her cousin. She called out: "Cousin, you're here too." She turned her head back, without exchanging greetings, and sighed first: "Cousin, what are we going to do? I haven't been myself these few days. I heard that there is a company commander lying here, maybe it's him. I asked the police officer at the gate, but he didn't know, let's go in and see. Are you also inquiring about Company Commander Zhao's whereabouts?" When Gui Zhi saw her, she immediately felt that the company commander inside might not be Ziqiang, but Guan Yaowu. She was a little disappointed. She agreed and followed her to the reception desk. When they arrived at the reception desk, there was an old lady in her fifties, wiping her tears, and asked the receptionist: "My son's name is Tian Qing, he is a company commander. Didn't the newspaper report that there is a company commander who came back from Ping'an Fort? I think that must be my son. Please, let me go in and see." The receptionist said: "As long as there is such a person, why wouldn't I let you go in and see? That's right, Ping'an Fort, there is a wounded company commander here." As soon as he said this, the three women, old and young, all became excited and looked at the receptionist. The old lady Tian said: "Isn't his surname Tian?" (450)</p>
<h3>Bathing</h3>
<p>— Ziyun</p>
<p>Bathing seems to be nothing more than taking off one's upper clothes, taking off one's lower clothes, sitting in the bathtub, dragging around with water for a while, rubbing off some sweat and dirt, wringing out the bath towel, and wiping the whole body.</p>
<p>But in Shanghai, there are countless ways to bathe, and each way has its own different meanings and tastes.</p>
<p>A shower is taken under a showerhead with running water. This is the way Westerners bathe. When the tap is turned on, water sprays straight down from the showerhead. People who take a shower stand under the showerhead, and after getting wet, they quickly rub their whole body red with a dry towel, and that's it. It is said that this is very hygienic. All new buildings and sports institutions have this equipment.</p>
<p>A steam bath is when the whole body is put into a specially made steam bucket and steamed with steam. The only thing exposed is the head. This bathing method came from Europe. It is said to cure chronic diseases. But steam baths in Shanghai have a mysterious color, because after the bath, there are beautiful Western women to give massages.</p>
<p>A seawater bath requires going to the Gaoqiao seawater bathing beach. Seawater baths are of great benefit to human health. There is another layer. These days, the darker a woman's skin is, like a native of the South Seas, the more it is considered to be in line with healthy beauty. Therefore, on the beaches of the seawater bathing beaches, there are often pairs of modern men and women, dipping their whole bodies in seawater and lying straight, making their snow-white legs and arms tanned to a purplish-brown.</p>
<p>Going to Hongkou Park to take a cold water bath is euphemistically called swimming, but in reality, nine out of ten people just go to soak for an hour or two.</p>
<h3>Clever Couplets at the Drinking Ice Chamber</h3>
<p>— (Weak)</p>
<p>The early summer is unusually hot, the most seen in sixty years, the long day is scorching, the stalls selling cold goods on the streets are rampant, and the increase is surging, and it is still remembered that north of Mysterious Street, there is a newly established Drinking Ice Chamber, and a couplet is attached to the door: "The sun's violence is encroaching, try asking compatriots whether they miss snow?""The scorching wind is attacking, why not the masses drink ice?" According to the above couplet, the two words "violent sun" are used twice, the reader will understand by himself, "cloud" is a Cantonese term for ice, and can also be used as a washing solution. The couplet "scorching wind" can be interpreted as northeast, (see Dictionary of Origins) "drinking ice" says: then there is an implicit meaning of "willing to be indifferent", the antithesis is neat, and the language is more double-meaning, such a good structure, I don't know whose handwriting it is.</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Summer Foods</h3>
<p>— A Southerner</p>
<p>With the changing seasons, the foods people eat also change; however, this change only refers to a portion of the food, not the entire selection. For example, in winter, when we eat rice, the dishes must be hot and flavorful; in summer, we still eat rice, but the dishes are not as hot, and the cooking methods are different from winter, especially for snacks. What I want to introduce here is a type of snack, but as the writer is a Southerner, these snacks are naturally limited to those popular in the South.</p>
<p>(1) Sesame Paste: Sesame is said to nourish the stomach and intestines. In summer, due to eating too much greasy food, the stomach tends to feel heavy and uncomfortable. Therefore, some people mix sesame seeds with half the amount of white rice, soak them in water for a considerable time until they soften, and then grind them into sesame-rice milk using a stone mill. After grinding, the sesame-rice milk is put into a pot to cook. The most important thing is to stir it continuously with a clean wooden stick while cooking to prevent it from turning into clumps. After cooking for about half an hour (depending on the amount of sesame-rice milk), when the sesame-rice milk boils, add some sugar, adjusting the amount to taste. Once all these steps are done, the nourishing and sweet sesame paste is complete. (Sesame comes in black and white varieties, with black sesame generally considered more beneficial!)</p>
<p>(2) Mung Bean Soup: The benefits of mung bean soup seem to have been discussed already, so I won't repeat them. Here, I want to introduce two other ways to make mung bean soup. A: Wash the mung beans, put them in a pot, add plenty of water, and boil them over high heat. After several hours, the mung beans and water will have merged, making it impossible to distinguish between the beans and the water. This creates a formal mung bean soup, where only the soup is visible, without discernible beans or water. Of course, we should not forget to add some sugar. If you can add lotus seeds and dried tangerine peel to cook together, that would be even better. B: Crush the mung beans with a stone, separating the shells from the meat. Then, put them in water. The shells, being light, will float to the surface, and we scoop them out. The beans that sink to the bottom are soaked for a while and then taken out to dry. On the other hand, boil some water and mix in sweet potato starch, sugar, and tangerine peel juice to make a clear and thin soup. At this point, the shelled mung beans can be added to the soup to cook, but they should only be cooked briefly before serving. (It's better to add tangerine peel juice after cooking!)</p>
<p>(3) Clear Heart Dumplings: The glutinous rice dumplings we usually see are made with glutinous rice flour. The clear heart dumplings I want to introduce now use sweet potato starch instead of glutinous rice flour. Sweet potato starch is made from sweet potatoes and can usually be bought in food stores. We mix the sweet potato starch with some water and slowly knead it by hand. Soon, the flour will become a large, sticky dough. Then, roll the large dough into countless small strips, about the thickness of a pencil. Then, use a knife to cut them into thin slices. After cutting, put them into already boiling, sweet sugar water to cook. When they are cooked, the dumplings will float to the surface on their own. At this point, another type of sweet and smooth clear heart dumpling is complete. The advantage of making these dumplings with sweet potato starch is that after cooking, they become completely transparent, like white jade, and they are so smooth that you won't want to swallow them! If you add some lilies and lotus seeds to the soup to cook together, that would be great!</p>

<p>Sports News: Shanghai-Tianjin Inter-City Tennis Tournament Concludes</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua Loses to Xiao Longgan</h3>
<p>Victory Determined After a Dramatic Five-Set Battle</p>
<p>Lin Suffers Cramps and Loses a Winnable Match</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 6th) The inter-city tennis tournament concluded at 7:30 this afternoon with the first singles match between Lin Saihua and Xiao Longgan. Last year, Baohua came to Tianjin to perform singles matches and was defeated by Xiao Longgan. In this rematch, Baohua knew that the outcome was unrelated to the championship, but it concerned his personal reputation, so he dared not relax. Xiao Longgan has always been known for his composure and, wanting to avenge yesterday's doubles defeat, he exerted all his strength to subdue Lin. Therefore, there were many exciting moments in the performance. After a dramatic five-set battle, the victory was determined. In the final fifth set, Lin Baohua suddenly suffered leg cramps when he was leading 5-4, and despite fighting through the pain, he was defeated by Xiao Longgan. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiao Longgan 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-5 Lin Baohua</p>
<p>After the serve, Baohua consistently used backhand long shots that landed on the baseline, which troubled Xiao Longgan. Baohua won the first set 6-2. In the second set, Xiao Longgan changed his strategy and intercepted the ball outside the baseline. When Baohua vigorously returned the shot, many landed outside the boundary, and he lost the set 4-6. The competition in the third set was even more intense, with many deuce situations. After reaching 5-5, Baohua committed many unforced errors with his long shots and lost two consecutive games, losing the set 5-7 again. In the fourth set, Baohua maintained his composure, carefully and effectively using smashes, and managed to struggle to a 6-4 victory, bringing the score to a tie. The fifth set determined the victory, and both players were extremely cautious. However, because they were both exhausted, their shots lacked power. One would win a game, and the other would catch up, creating a score of 5-4. Baohua had victory within reach, but unexpectedly, he suffered leg cramps, losing the opportunity. Xiao Longgan turned the tide, tying the score at 5-5. Afterwards, Baohua was weakened by the leg pain, and Xiao Longgan won two consecutive games, losing the set 5-7 again, resulting in an overall defeat of 2-3.</p>

<p>Gaoqiao Beach</p>
<h3>Thousands Vie to See the Mermaid</h3>
<p>Crowds Almost Prevent Performance</p>
<p>Twilight Prevents Satisfying Expectations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Swimming Association's Gaoqiao Beach Bathing Ground, Lianhua Woolen Mill, and two other groups jointly invited Miss Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid returning to Hong Kong after visiting Shanghai from Jiangxi, to perform swimming techniques at Gaoqiao Beach Bathing Ground and held a public banquet, creating an unprecedented swimming event in Shanghai. The details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Special Boat Departure: Yesterday morning, Yang Xiuqiong went with her parents, siblings to a banquet hosted by Ying Zheng Factory, returning at 12 o'clock. (Xinya) Three organizations, including the Chinese Swimming Research Association, sent a car to pick up Yang Xiuqiong, who went with her father, Zhu Nan, and brother, Changhua, and the staff members drove to Yangshupu Dinghai Bridge to board a special boat. The boat arrived at Gaoqiao, and Yang and her party disembarked and transferred to a car to the Seaside Hotel. The guests continued to travel by the original boat to Gaoqiao Wharf and then proceeded to the hotel.</p>
<p>Three Organizations Welcome at Seaside Hotel (Photo by Qichang)</p>
<p>Protection Along the Way: To ensure thorough and hospitable reception, specific personnel were assigned duties, including Yang Hongkui and Yu Binqi for seating arrangements, Zhao Panshi and Chen Zuogan for reception, and Cai Diaotu, Li Rixin, Jin Shuqing, Hu Tiewu, and Wang Jianxin as staff. When Miss Yang went to Gaoqiao, the Public Security Bureau dispatched Detective Team Leader Lu and detectives Wang Shouzhi and Yang Jisheng to provide protection along the way. The Municipal Ferry Management Office also sent a representative, Lai Jin, to accompany and assist with the reception.</p>
<p>Spectators Surround Yang: Miss Yang and her party arrived at the Seaside Hotel in Gaoqiao and entered rooms 202 and 204 reserved by the welcoming organizations. At this time, reporters and photographers from various newspapers in Shanghai also followed, and many spectators also brought cameras, crowding among the reporters. At 3:30, Miss Yang posed for photos at the request of reporters on the upstairs balcony and in front of the downstairs main entrance, but due to the large crowds, it was impossible to take pictures. Finally, the reporters were able to take pictures in the garden.</p>
<p>Difficulty Advancing Due to Crowd: At 4:30, guided by the organizing committee, Miss Yang and her father and brother changed into swimsuits, all in black, except for Yang, who wore a blue-striped bathrobe and straw sandals. Her demeanor and appearance were extremely beautiful. However, with ten thousand spectators at the beach and a narrow path obstructed by tall grass, order was somewhat lacking. Miss Yang and her party struggled to reach the beach and had to return to the Seaside Hotel. When Miss Yang returned to the Seaside Hotel, the spectators followed closely, and within a short time, over a thousand people gathered in front of the door and downstairs, creating a clamor. They insisted that Miss Yang come out and perform. At that time, order was almost completely disrupted. Mr. Cai Diaotu went inside to discuss the situation with Yang's father and daughter and stood on the balcony steps to address the crowd, saying that all guests should maintain order, gather on the beach, and make way for Miss Yang to perform in the sea, fulfilling everyone's long-standing wishes. Hearing this, the audience began to applaud and retreat, but after several twists and turns, it was already 6:45.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong Goes to Beach to Perform (Photo by Ye Changlie)</p>
<p>Performance in the Sea: Miss Yang, accompanied by her father and brother, emerged again, escorted by four police officers led by Zhan Chun, director of the Fourth Division of the Third District of Gaoqiao, with bamboo poles used as barriers on both sides, finally allowing unobstructed passage directly to the beach. The first to enter the water was her younger brother, Changhua, with Xiuqiong in the middle and her father, Zhu Nan, bringing up the rear. Accompanied by over a hundred swimming generals from the association, including Yu Binqi, Li Rixin, Zhang Yunqi, Bao Lengxue, Liu Zuxin, Zhang Jiazhen, and Xu Xinqi, they headed straight into the huge waves. Miss Yang took the lead, with swimming champions following behind, like dragons diving and floodgates opening. The waves at the beach were extremely violent. Due to the setting sun, the swimming performance could not be fully realized and only consisted of a circuit from south to north before returning to shore.</p>
<p>At the Reception: After Miss Yang and the swimmers landed, they went together to the Seaside Hotel. It was nearly 8:00. Reception Director Zhao Panshi and others warmly welcomed the guests, who were seated according to their invitations. Miss Yang, her father, and brother were seated upstairs. The chairman of the organization was originally Mr. Wang Xiaolai, but due to Wang's trip to Qingdao, Yu Binqi presided over the meeting (the report speech was long and omitted). After the dinner, the China Harmonica Association played famous songs such as "Raise Your Glass and Sing Loudly," "Dragon Soaring and Phoenix Dancing," "Carmen," "Forward Bravely," and "Amitabha," with melodious and moving tones. Miss Yang praised them highly.</p>
<p>Uncertain Return Date: Afterwards, the reporter met with Miss Yang. According to her, she will return to Xinya in Shanghai at 11:00 tonight (the 6th). Tomorrow morning (today), she will attend a tea party at Jiaotong University, and at 1:00 PM, she will go to Liangjiang Physical Education College. The day after tomorrow (tomorrow), she will visit Mayor Wu and Director Pan of the Education Bureau. It is not yet decided whether she will leave Shanghai on the 8th. She is feeling slightly unwell due to fatigue from days of social engagements and may stay in Shanghai for two or three days to rest. At 2:00 PM today, Yang will host a tea party at the third floor of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road to entertain various circles.</p>
<p>Junpu Bureau Letter: This newspaper received a letter from the Junpu General Bureau yesterday, which reads: "To the Editors of Shenbao: We have read in your newspaper's sports news column yesterday about Miss Yang Xiuqiong's performance at the invitation of the Junpu Bureau. We found that Miss Yang was invited to perform by the sports association organized by our bureau's staff, and the bureau was not informed beforehand. We are afraid that rumors will spread, so we are sending this letter to correct the information and hope it will be published in the letter column to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Junpu General Bureau, 23.8.6."</p>

<h3>On "Substance and Application"</h3>
<p>— Dong Ruo</p>
<p>Zhang Zhidong invented a sentence decades ago: "Chinese learning as substance, Western learning as application." This is indeed somewhat reasonable. The reason is not that it instructs us on what attitude to take towards accepting Western culture, but rather that this sentence has been constantly validated over the decades, showing that he made a prediction that grasped the facts. The so-called "Chinese learning" is the sum total of culture produced in our inherent social system; therefore, if the social system on which "Chinese learning" is based exists! Or partially exists, then the state of its acceptance of Western culture cannot but be based on Chinese learning as "substance" and foreign Western capitalism as "application"!</p>
<p>"Filial piety" is our inherent "substance." Writing on a blank sheet of Western stationery, "To our dear parents, respectfully reporting," isn't that "application" derived from the West?</p>
<p>"Welcoming the gods and holding festivals" is our inherent superstitious "substance"; but using this large cargo truck, loaded with many people dancing a yellow dragon, driving through like lightning, announcing to the general public the XXXXX convention to be held in the coming days, who can say that this is not the most ingenious way in which material civilization is "used" by so-called spiritual civilization!</p>
<p>Understanding the wonderful use of the "substance and application" theory in China, it is not difficult for us to understand that the application of spirit writing diagrams is not without reason. These serve only one purpose, which is to use Western learning as "application" to consolidate the existence of our spiritual civilization!</p>
<p>However, this is a painstaking and futile effort. Imperialism has long shaken the social system on which our "Chinese learning" is based, and the "application" that Western culture has given us has long made us aware of the necessity of changing our system.</p>
<h3>When I Was in Zhaotong</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Thinking of not being able to travel to the seaside or lakeside in the sweltering small house is naturally a hateful thing, but lying on a chair after a meal, quietly savoring those cities I used to visit in the summer is not without interest.</p>
<p>First of all, I thought of Zhaotong, where I lived nine years ago. It was a big city in eastern Yunnan. At that time, I still appeared on the streets and in the inns there as a student, although I was already two or three thousand miles away from the last school I attended.</p>
<p>In an old bookstore, I was casually flipping through books when I happened to meet a teacher from the Mission Middle School. Talking to him, I learned that he had studied for several years in Chengdu, where I had lived for four years. The school was the West China Union University, run by foreigners. When he invited me to visit his school outside the city, we passed through the city gate and saw some leaflets posted on the wall, which immediately made him shake his head and show a disdainful expression. I still remember that situation very clearly. The leaflets were agitating the tide of the May 30th Incident, declaring that they would use force to drive out the British and American tobacco company managers stationed locally, signed: "Zhaotong Student Union."</p>
<p>The school was on summer vacation, and there were no traces of boys in white uniforms under the corridor hanging with ivy and on the grass dotted with the shade of trees. The sound of our footsteps echoed particularly loudly in the silent corridor. A tabby cat lying by the glass window, which was originally dozing, was startled and meowed before scurrying away.</p>
<p>Walking into a guest hall with a painting of Jesus, he was still talking angrily about the students in the city not knowing what they were doing and just making trouble: 丨</p>
<p>"Look, how ridiculous, these middle school students! The British-American Tobacco Company is jointly run by British and Americans, but they insist that it is run solely by the British, and they are determined to oppose it. Now it's even worse, they want to drive them out. Ridiculous, I don't think they dare to do that! It's enough to oppose the British, why do they have to oppose the Americans too?: Do you smoke?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he handed me a cigarette. I declined, saying I didn't. His expression changed slightly, and he said softly:</p>
<p>"This isn't entirely made by the British, you know!"</p>
<p>Then he went on to say that he himself had asked some students: They were really extremely cunning, they insisted that "the so-called British-American Tobacco means the most beautiful tobacco in England. Haha (using a burst of laughter to despise the students' confusion)."</p>
<p>Finally, he asked me to criticize his opinion. I didn't answer, but changed the topic to something else, because in front of this clever man, I was willing to remain silent.</p>
<p>Maybe I myself was also wrong. In the midst of the Zhaotong students' anti-foreign sentiment, I still went to the Gospel Church from time to time: This was not to listen to the pastor's sermon, but to seek spiritual sustenance in the reading room. Because at that time, I was almost trapped there, and I wanted to go somewhere else, but I was afraid of bandits along the way, and I couldn't take a step. The only person I could chat with temporarily was this teacher from the Mission Middle School whom I had just met, but he was too clever, making it impossible to open my mouth. On the street, there was simply no place to read newspapers. Everywhere I could only see people setting up stalls on the side of the road to sell opium in retail. The smell of opium permeated all the streets and alleys. Even now, when I think of Zhaotong, I feel like I smell that dizzying smell again. Or even if I accidentally smell the smoke from cooking opium there, I will immediately think of those old and dirty streets lying under the summer sun. Probably in my life, the connection between opium and Zhaotong will never be separated.</p>
<p>(In such a depressing place, as long as there are books and newspapers to read, one must go, regardless of others' disapproval. In culturally underdeveloped places, cultural invasion is ultimately difficult to resist. All of China needs to make every effort to develop its own culture, and Zhaotong is just one example that can be cited.)</p>
<h3>Under the Signs of Disaster</h3>
<p>— Lian Zhen</p>
<p>Summer has come, and under the scorching sun, I climb up the rather tall ancient trees naked, and use spider webs to catch some cicadas to sell to children in the market, which is enough to cover the cost of food for the day. Ah, really, a mother's heart is too cruel. Tears couldn't stop welling up in Li Sanniang's eyes like a tide. Ah! Now, for the sake of her father's illness, for her father's medical expenses, she heartlessly sold him for two hundred yuan. Ah! Her father's illness certainly cannot go untreated, but this child is innocent! Li Sanniang's chest was soaked with tears, and she finally climbed down from the cart frame weakly.</p>
<p>She had no heart to continue working. Thinking that although her husband was being cared for by Aunt Li next door, Aunt Li's child was also sick, and she might not be able to spare time. She covered the waterwheel frame with reeds and drew black, muddy water from the river to wipe her body all over. At this time, her mind was full of two different images, and gradually the moon seemed to turn into the outline of a child's head. Full of tears, he was calling out "Mama". Li Sanniang's heart ached like a knife. Her legs went limp like cotton. "My little Ling'er, ah, little Ling'er," she murmured uncontrollably. But then she thought of her husband's dying appearance, which rushed into her mind again. Her back suddenly felt as if she had been hit with several poles, and she finally fled home like waking from a dream.</p>
<p>The door of her house was ajar, and a weak moan could be faintly heard inside. She slipped in and saw that her husband's breathing was very rapid, his head stretching and shrinking, his hands and feet trembling, and his eyes closed so tightly that no line was visible. She hurriedly called out "Ling'er's dad, Ling'er's dad," but Ling'er's dad, lying on the bed, seemed not to hear and only gasped rapidly. Li Sanniang had no choice but to call out again: Aunt Li! Aunt Li! After a while, Aunt Li hobbled in from outside the door. "Ah, Sanniangzi, my little grandson is vomiting and having diarrhea badly, I can't leave him for a moment," Aunt Li said anxiously, "How is A Ling's dad now?"</p>
<p>But as soon as Aunt Li's eyes fell on A Ling's dad, she suddenly remembered the dying scene of her eldest son. She panicked a little, seeing Li Sanniang still stroking the patient's body: "A Ling's dad, A Ling's dad, do you want to drink tea? Do you want to drink tea?" She quickly dragged Li Sanniang's body away, "Quickly go and invite Uncle Chen to come, he must come immediately." As she urged.</p>
<p>However, just as Li Sanniang walked out the door, A Ling's dad's breathing became even more rapid, and his head stretched and shrunk even more violently. After a quarter of an hour, A Ling's dad finally lay stiffly motionless on the bed.</p>
<p>Li Sanniang came running back from outside, panting: "Uncle Chen will not be able to come until ten o'clock..." She had just said this when she suddenly caught sight of the stiff corpse on the bed. Li Sanniang changed her face and suddenly threw herself on the bed, sinking heavily into the upper part of the corpse:</p>
<p>"Ling'er's dad, where have you gone? Where have you gone?..." (The End)</p>
<h3>Does Chinese Grammar Need to be Westernized?</h3>
<p>Wen Gongzhi's Letter to Kang Bodu (July 25th)</p>
<p>Mr. Kang Bodu: Today I read your great work published in Free Talk. I wisely stated that there are still many aggressive vanguards (traitors) who are aimed at Zhang, and you believe that the prevalence of European culture is a "necessity". I really don't know where to start with this? Although the Chinese are useless, they can always speak. If we must abolish the Chinese language and make the villagers also "miss𢖼" , I don't see this as a "necessity" in Chinese culture. For example, in the words of the Chinese, Zhang Jia said, "It's raining today." Li Yi said, "Yes, it's getting cold." According to the proposition of your theory, it should be changed to, "It's raining today," Zhang Jia said. "It's getting cold; Yes," Li Yi said. Is this a "necessity" for the entire "Chinese race"? The Europeanized writing of general translators has been enough to block the passage of Chinese and Western cultures, making even those who can read the original text unable to understand the translation. Adding your "necessity" will make Chinese books even more unreadable. Mr. Chen Zizhan's advocacy of "mass language" is a matter of course. Chinese people should always speak Chinese, that is absolutely true. But you insist that Europeanized grammar is necessary! No wonder the big name is "Kang Bodu", it is a full-fledged expression of the "comprador mentality". Mr. Liu Bannong said, "Translation is to enable those who do not understand foreign languages to read"; this is an exact and unchangeable theorem. But you scold Mr. Liu for believing that it is necessary to make the entire Chinese people use Europeanized grammar! You are resting in the summer, so take a break! Imperialism's poisonous gas bombs to exterminate the Chinese have been made in countless numbers. You can be a comprador if you want, just don't sell out the entire nation. I am a fool who does not understand inverted Europeanized writing! I almost suspect that you are not a citizen of our country, in view of your earnest promotion. Now I specifically ask you why you are throwing this cultural poison gas? Have you been instructed by imperialists? In short, the Chinese people within four hundred and forty-nine million (excluding Mr. Chen) dare not accept your proposition! Please pay attention</p>
<p>Kang Bodu Answers Wen Gongzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Gongzhi: Adding a little Europeanization to Chinese grammar is my proposal, not "abolishing the Chinese language" or being "instructed by imperialists", but you immediately gave me serious charges such as "traitor", representing "four hundred and forty-nine million (excluding Mr. Chen) Chinese people", and wanting to kill me. My proposal may be wrong, but to pronounce a death sentence right away, although the method is very fashionable, seems a bit excessive. Moreover, I think the opinions of "four hundred and forty-nine million (excluding Mr. Chen) Chinese people" are not necessarily the same as yours. You have not sought consent, you are posing as a representative.</p>
<p>Europeanizing Chinese grammar is not about learning foreign languages, but I don't want to talk to you about these shallow principles. I am not afraid of the heat, but I am bored. But I still want to say one more time: I advocate that it is necessary to add some Europeanization to Chinese grammar. This proposition comes from facts. Chinese people "can always speak", that's right, but to move forward, sticking to the old ways is not enough. An example before your eyes is that in your letter of several hundred words, you have used "regarding" twice, which has nothing to do with ancient Chinese, but is a Europeanized grammar that started with direct translation, and even the two words "Europeanization" are Europeanized words; you also used "cancel", which is a purely Japanese word, and "gas", which is the original German word transliterated by the Japanese without change. They are all used very appropriately, and are "necessarily" Western. For example, "poison gas", if you use the inherent Chinese phrase "toxic gas", it would appear ambiguous and not necessarily the stuff inside the poison bomb. So writing "poison gas" is indeed a "necessary" move.</p>
<p>You have not looked in the mirror yourself, and have inadvertently proved that you are also a person who uses Europeanized grammar and uses foreign devil terms, but I see that you are definitely not a "vanguard (traitor) who is aimed at Western aggression", so I also want to prove that I am not one of those people. Otherwise, your spouting dog's blood on people would only defile your own mouth first.</p>
<p>I think that in debating matters, threats and slander are useless. A person who uses a pen gets angry at you right away and wants my life, which is even more ridiculous. You should not be impatient, but quietly look at your own letter again and think about yourself, what about it? I am writing to reply specifically, and wish you good health in the heat. Sincerely yours, Kang Bodu takes off his hat and bows.</p>
<h3>Paying Wages</h3>
<p>— Ya Guang</p>
<h3>I Come From the East (16)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>After long deliberation, I finally followed many Chinese sailors and passengers ashore after the ship docked for a few hours. I set foot on the enemy's land. At the Sakuragicho station, I boarded the tram with men and women from the enemy country. In the post office and telegraph office, I began to feel the hardship of being an employee of my government, and the meager salary. I began to talk to them, under the advertisement of "The airmail route between Tokyo and Shenyang will be opened". I felt insulted myself, but I endured and moved forward, from Yokohama to Tokyo, which could be reached by a half-hour tram ride. Because I had a friend in Kamimeguro, I did not go directly to Tokyo Station. I transferred trams several times, and then zigzagged along many small yellow mud roads before arriving at Lin Biezhuang's place. His face, which had been worn thin by studying under humiliation in Japan, appeared amidst the scarlet azalea bushes.</p>
<p>When you get to the Kamimeguro area, you can see the real Japanese life. The wooden houses are so small, and so many people are packed into one house. Although the interior of the houses is not as squalid as the Jiangcao sheds, the suffering endured inside is not much different. The streets are piled with yellow mud. When cars pass by, there is as much ash and sand as in Beiping, and as bad as in the South. The signboards and white flags with red characters on the side of the road are as many and as mixed as in the Xiaodongmen area of Shanghai. Women carrying children run all over the street. Most of the shops have decorations from before the Meiji Restoration. There are indeed quite a few bare-armed people. If it were not for a few Japanese characters on the signboards and the clothes of Japanese women, you would suspect that you were traveling in a village in Shandong, or in Wangfu Lane in Nanjing, or in the Jiangbei area of Shanghai or Wusong.</p>
<p>From Kamimeguro to Tokyo, what strikes you most is the ubiquitous clamor of wireless radio receivers. The streets and alleys are filled with wireless broadcasts. Unexpectedly, the United States uses wireless radio for entertainment, while Japan uses wireless radio to issue calls to attract attention and warnings. A friend who has lived in Tokyo for many years told me that most of the wireless broadcasts are forecasts of the failure of the disarmament conference, the expansion of the American navy, and Japan's urgent need to prepare. The faces of the men and women on the street all look serious. If you want to find a grinning face like an American, you will be disappointed in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The department stores in Tokyo dress up young women and have them stand at the door to greet customers. The female clerks inside look like the little dolls in Japanese toys. Round and flat faces, thickly coated with white powder. The eyes are in the shape of a circle, and the Western-style clothes cannot bind their excessively plump bodies.</p>

<p>Food Prices are Rising Domestically</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Prices Soar Repeatedly</h3>
<p>After the market opened this morning, the flour market saw a steady rise due to the rise in spot and futures prices of foreign wheat and rice. The brisk trading and enthusiastic sentiment were unseen for many years. At the close of the afternoon market, everyone was scrambling to buy, and the rising trend was even stronger. The highest price for December was 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 fen and a half, which was a huge increase of 2 jiao and 5 li. The market remained remarkably buoyant at the close, mainly because the current demand from all parties was high, and the drought and flood caused the inevitable rise in grain prices. There was both actual sales and speculation, as well as the struggle to cover short positions, resulting in such a state in the market. However, the sharpness seemed too strong. The closing prices were up 1 jiao, 2 fen, 2.5 li this month, up 1 jiao, 4 fen and a half in September and October, up 1 jiao, 8 fen, 2.5 li in November, up 1 jiao, 9 fen and a half in December, and up 1 jiao, 5 fen, 7.5 li in January.</p>
<p>The fierce rise in wheat prices in recent days has attracted the attention of stockpiling merchants from all sides. Yesterday, the spot price of wheat had exceeded 4 yuan, and more than 10,000 bags were traded throughout the day, with the price reaching 4 yuan and 5 fen. Lower grades also reached 3 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, which were distributed by firms and factories. Compared with the previous selling price, this was a large increase of 2 jiao. After the auction market opened, the price of foreign wheat rose by 5 or 6 jiao, while the price of foreign rice, especially Ke Xian rice, soared in recent days, with a crazy increase of more than 1 yuan in two or three days, which further triggered the rise in wheat prices. The auction market opened with a rise, and then immediately jumped wildly. At noon, the prices for September, October, and November each jumped by 3 jiao, 3 fen, while the prices for December and January rose by a huge 3 jiao, 7 or 8 fen. Such a soaring rise was rare. In the afternoon, stockpiling long positions were sold off, and the market returned to normal. However, most people in the market were optimistic, with closing prices up 1 jiao, 1 fen in August, up 2 jiao, 7 fen in September, up 3 jiao each in October and November, up 3 jiao and a half in December, and up 3 jiao, 4 fen in January.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Needs Grain</p>
<h3>Central Customs Foreign Rice Rises Again</h3>
<p>丨丨Foreign Rice Arrives in Jiangxi in Batches丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, He Xia white rice only rose by two or three jiao due to balanced arrivals and sales. However, foreign rice and local early rice experienced an unexpected surge in prices. This was because Saigon orders continued to arrive, and rumors of rising transportation costs from other ports spread. It seemed the market could be stabilized, and inland demand had weakened. There was also no interest from both the North and South Seas, so people felt more secure. Unexpectedly, this year's floods and droughts occurred everywhere. Rice-producing provinces along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were all affected by disasters. Jiangxi province, in particular, had a large army of 400,000 troops, requiring even more grain. Currently, Jiangxi merchants are arriving in Shanghai to purchase supplies. Yesterday, their appetite remained strong, mostly buying medium-grade rice. Transactions totaled 15,000 bags. Local merchants also had dealings with the interior. The entire city sold 12,000 bags of old small-grain rice, 800 bags of Saigon rice, and 12,000 bags of early rice from various regions. Small-grain rice rose from 9 yuan, 9 jiao, and 6 fen to 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 4 fen 8, a significant increase of seven to eight jiao compared to the previous market. Number 1 Saigon new rice was 11 yuan and 9 jiao, and old rice was 11 yuan, also rising three to six jiao. Machine-milled Jing rice rose to 11 yuan, and Shashi brown rice rose to 8 yuan and 6 jiao. All other types of rice also increased, with larger increases of three or four jiao or six, seven, or eight jiao. Medium-grade rice, in particular, was favored by Jiangxi merchants and became popular.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is being shipped to the Yangtze River after being absent for over a year. This morning, a British ship exported 900 bags, and tomorrow morning, another 2,000 bags will be shipped to various locations along the Yangtze.</p>
<h3>He Xia Rice Arrivals Decrease, Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supplies from various merchants was only from the 13th and 14th, (about 1,000+ shi of cargo). The market situation was still one of firm prices due to the drought, with prices continuing to rise. However, sales were also minimal. Opening prices for regular merchants such as those from Jiangsu, Tongzhou, and Nanxun for japonica rice, and Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sixi, and Xilian for late rice, increased by one or two jiao. Du Yang tip rice also increased by a bit. Yinbian Yuan rice increased by two jiao due to scarcity. Zhoupu new japonica rice increased by two chi. Hengmian new japonica rice was listed for the first time this morning, totaling over 30 shi, priced at 11 yuan and 2 jiao to 10 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supplies from He Xia was from the 17th and 18th. The market had a calm appetite for various types of rice. White japonica rice was flat and weak, while there was still demand for Yangdu and early rice, and prices increased by another one or two jiao. Dongxin japonica rice arrivals were slightly scarce, and retail demand continued to be active, with prices increasing by two jiao. The remaining goods maintained their position.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains, Oil, and Bean Cakes All Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for coarse grains, oil, and bean cakes saw a significant change. Compared to last Saturday, prices soared. This was because uneven rainfall in various provinces led to reports of serious disasters in various producing areas, resulting in reduced supplies. Furthermore, Jiujiang city began purchasing rice and grains from this city, causing the market to follow the trend of rice and wheat and rise sharply. Soybean oil and peanut oil increased by one yuan, new and old beans increased by three or four jiao, and other coarse grains increased by one or two jiao. Bean cakes only increased by three fen due to the severe drought and poor sales. Yesterday's sales were mostly to囤积 [tún jī] hoarders. Two to thirty carts of old soybeans were sold, with four or five carts going to local retailers and the rest being purchased by hoarders. A total of 1,400 to 1,500 bags of new soybeans were sold, including the first listing of over 400 bags of Hankou early yellow soybeans, priced at three yuan and six jiao four to six fen, purchased from the interior. This year's output was higher than in previous years and contained mud and ash. Additionally, the first batch of 100 bags of Jiujiang Liufangchi soybeans arrived, priced at three yuan and seven jiao five fen. Although the goods were good, they were inevitably dry and stiff.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Close, Financial Market Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Year Festival, and foreign banks were completely closed as usual for the day. Although Chinese banks were open as usual, transactions were necessarily limited to domestic transactions and there was no foreign business. As a result, the market felt quite quiet. The market price for foreign short-term financing remained at seven fen in both the morning and afternoon, unchanged for a week. Overdrafts were priced at two fen. For bill transactions, transfers in the morning session totaled over 2.9 million, new transactions over 400,000, transactions in the afternoon session over 200,000, transactions in the Small General Association over 200,000, foreign mortgage transactions withdrawals over 400,000, and new loans over 500,000. Bank collections and settlements with foreign firms were completely suspended. Although Chinese firms were open as usual, they were affected by the foreign holiday, and domestic trade was limited. Yesterday, the market collected and settled over 1.6 million in bills and over 1.5 million in various types of goods and miscellaneous loans. Warehouse inflows and outflows amounted to 600,000, but there was no news of foreign exchange advances or loans. Qianzhuang foreign public bill collections and settlements totaled over 38 million, and remittances from various sources totaled over 500,000. Furthermore, the total number of silver dollar exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 6th was 8,289,837 yuan and 3 fen, including 4,745,772 yuan and 6 jiao 2 fen in silver dollars and 3,544,064 yuan and 1 fen in remittances.</p>
<h3>Slight Turnaround in Minor Foreign Currency Market</h3>
<p>After continuous declines in the minor foreign currency market, a turnaround finally occurred yesterday. Although transactions yesterday were not very smooth, the market situation was slightly firmer due to insufficient inventory. The opening price for Jiangsu minor foreign currency in the morning session was good, at 1 yuan and 5 jiao, reaching 835 yuan and 5 jiao. The afternoon session was the same. Morning session transactions totaled 3,000 jiao, with no activity in the afternoon. The Guangdong minor foreign currency fell by half a yuan in the morning session, to 727 yuan, but rebounded by one yuan in the afternoon session, to 728 yuan. The result was an improvement of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Morning session transactions totaled 35,000 jiao, and afternoon session transactions totaled 55,000 jiao. Copper coins remained the same as the previous day, at 331,500 wen, with transactions valued at 8,400 yuan in foreign currency, equivalent to 27,846 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Gold Exchange August Public Bond Pre-Notice</h3>

<h3>Bond Prices Temporarily in a Sideways Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Exchange saw prices trend sideways, due to a gloomy and confused environment. Huang Fu's trip north was not yet confirmed, and news of the Anglo-Japanese dispute was conflicting. Although the market had stopped selling Four numbers, retail sentiment had not yet recovered, so prices remained sideways. However, this sideways trend is not expected to last long. During yesterday's trading, the initial round of National Troops Reorganization and this month's Disbandment of Troops saw slight gains of one or two jiao, but quickly weakened. There were more sellers of Fifty number, with a maximum loss of half and five jiao for gold short-term, followed by losses of two or three jiao for National Troops Reorganization and this month's Disbandment of Troops. The remainder saw slight gains of five fen to one or two jiao. The market trended sideways, and the overall result was that most prices fell by five fen, one jiao, or three to four jiao. Only National Troops Reorganization and Ninety-Six number rose by one jiao and a half to three jiao. Total transactions amounted to 9,024,000 yuan. A comparative table of price increases and decreases is shown on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Securities Stocks Drop the Most</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that the stocks with the largest drops on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday (the 4th) were around four yuan, due to the weakness of agricultural tool stocks. The agricultural tool stocks fell because the drought reduced farmers' purchasing power. The small exchange market also declined, and the bond market showed no trend. Coarse grains rose sharply due to poor harvests. Large silver bars reached 47 cents per ounce, the highest peak since 1929. This was a result of Finance Minister Mao Gengtao's announcement that the government would print new silver certificates and continue to purchase silver. Half-day trading volume was 300,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Both Bulls and Bears Watch the Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable and exceptionally quiet, but spot yarn sales are still maintaining, and each base has its volume. However, it is still difficult to excite people, the existing yarns in the yarn and cloth warehouse still have no sales opportunities. Therefore, the large short positions of foreign firms are safely not replenished. As for the spot yarn sales, although the market is good, the force of rising prices is weak, so the market is in a state of suspended animation. Golden Rooster is stable.</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of standard yarn saw a slight increase of several points of American cotton, but the covert sentiment was extremely scattered, with no signs of revitalization. Both bulls and bears maintained a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in an extremely stable market. As a result, each month rose two, four, and five jiao, with a total of 11,000 bales transacted. Sold Dafu 350 bales, Yuanda 600 bales, Yuande 300 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Hengchang 400 bales, and Xiesheng 700 bales. Purchased Dafeng 1,550 bales, Changyu 650 bales, Yuanyi 400 bales, Yicheng 600 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, and Runkang 700 bales.

<h3>Standard Cotton Awaits US Cotton Estimate Report</h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to weaken, and US cotton is showing a slight rebound. Local sentiment remains calm. According to some sources, the domestic cotton production situation is currently good, so buyers are not active. There is some selling of old cotton, which is weakening the market further. However, a certain cotton firm has absorbed more than 30,000 dans. Based on the market situation, changes are expected to occur after the US cotton report is released.</p>
<p>Trading in Listed Cotton Quiet</p>
<p>The listed cotton market opened in the morning, and although US cotton rose by five to eleven points, the atmosphere was quiet and sentiment was depressed after a factory dumped old cotton. There were fewer buyers in the market, and the market outlook was bleak. There was little trading. Everyone is waiting for the US cotton estimate to be released before making further plans. As a result, each month fell by five fen to one and a half jiao, with a total of 48,200 dans transacted. Sold Dafu 5,700 dans, Hengyi 1,300 dans, Gengfeng 4,500 dans, Junchang 1,500 dans, Yuanda 1,100 dans, Yuanyi 2,300 dans, Yichang 1,000 dans, Runkang 1,700 dans, Xiesheng 1,000 dans, Hengchang 1,500 dans, Dachang 2,600 dans, Xinheng 1,100 dans, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dans.

<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Last week's market activity was largely due to speculators focusing on the April/May period in anticipation of the August 21st estimate release. Japanese demand was moderate, Shanghai was selling futures, European news was slightly weak, and new cotton was generally being shipped to Lancashire. Local factories were paying attention to spot goods. The Lihou rain activity was due to inland coastal rain erosion, which slightly damaged Bai Luoxi. In terms of rainfall, it was not yet excessive. According to reliable estimates, the area of the Cotu cotton field has increased by 10% compared to last year.

<h3>Unfavorable News for New US Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, August 3rd telegram reporting the cotton market conditions for the week, early in the week, unfavorable weather and poor cotton production news caused futures cotton to rise sharply, but it soon rebounded as many parties settled and the European situation became worrisome again. It is uncertain whether private estimates of poor cotton production are accurate, and the cotton production outlook may be overly discounted. This is also why merchants are shifting towards the selling side. Trading gradually decreased, and many in the industry squared their trades to await the USDA cotton production report. It is reported that storms in the Gulf of Mexico have caused considerable damage to southern Texas, but it has benefited cotton production elsewhere. Northern Texas, Oklahoma, and parts of Arkansas are still suffering from drought. According to recent news from Washington, the Penhale Act will be implemented even if cotton receipts are below the limit, but efforts are being made to allow cotton farmers whose cotton production is lower than their previous limit to sell excess cotton exceeding the tax-free amount to farmers whose cotton production exceeds the limit. The delay in issuing tax-free certificates has prevented new cotton from the Southwest from entering the market sooner.</p>

<h3>Woolen Fabric Autumn Sales Gradually Start</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric piece goods, autumn sales are also about to start. As the new autumn approaches, merchants in the market are starting to prepare one after another, and the standard market is entering a better situation. Yesterday, merchants from Chengdu and Chongqing and Shenzhuang's were strongly interested in thick woolen camel hair fabrics. Merchants from Beijing, Tianjin, and Hankou mostly came to Shanghai to select and purchase goods themselves. There were inquiries and negotiations for various popular Western-style goods. This is the first batch of business in the second half of the year. Formal large-scale transactions will need to wait another half a month. Looking at the atmosphere at the meeting yesterday, apart from winter goods not yet being formally standardized, autumn woolen fabrics, mainstream goods seem to be better than Western-style goods.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<h3>Arrival of Opening Four Meter Goods Causes a Steep Decline</h3>
<p>Wool and cotton thread prices have fallen sharply recently because since the tariff reduction, a large number of Japanese "opening four meter" goods have been imported and have arrived in large quantities. Each item has fallen by as much as thirty or forty yuan. A double-strand of 32 counts now sells for only 565 yuan per piece. All wool weaving factories are even more weakened because supply exceeds demand. This shipment was sold by brokerage firms.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>US Initiates International Silk Industry Conference</h3>
<p>丨China is Also Among Those Invited丨</p>
<p>American silk merchants recently organized the International Raw Silk Association in New York and scheduled an International Silk Industry Conference. They sent telegrams inviting representatives from silk-producing countries to participate. China also received a telegram invitation from the association. The Silk Improvement Committee organized by the Economic Committee is paying close attention to the association. In addition to replying to the association expressing agreement, they have telegraphed the Chinese consulate in New York, requesting them to send someone to attend the meeting and to investigate and report back the association's objectives and details at any time for review.</p>
<h3>Yellow and White Reeled Silk Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Local silk factories, due to excessive losses and inability to support operations, are preparing to shut down, and the wages owed to female workers must be cleared. They can only sell the silk they have on hand at a loss. Chinese and foreign silk merchants are taking the opportunity to suppress prices, exacerbating the silk market's downturn. Yesterday, 50 bales of white reeled silk and 10 bales of yellow reeled silk were received from Choumen and Dachang, respectively, and prices continued to weaken.</p>
<h3>Rayon Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The rayon market situation recently, the local sales market is still light, the Japanese goods with 30 count number one body is improved yesterday, each case 390 yuan, not tax the sale price is 185 yuan each case, so the purchaser are happy to adopt, in addition to the goods remain solid and hard</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Closing Reaches Five</h3>

They are now rushing to reel the remaining dry cocoons in order to pay off the wages owed to female workers separately.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Quiet Due to Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Western merchants' summer holiday, and major British foreign firms closed their offices as usual. Some dealers only had half-day transactions, resulting in an unusually quiet tea market. The only firms in the city that purchased Qimen and Ningzhou black tea, and Luzhuang Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Gongxi, and Hamu green tea, were Xiehe, Tianxiang, Tianyu, and Fushi, totaling over 1,300 boxes. These were mostly goods negotiated last week, so there was not much change in tea prices.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Dutch Red Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Increases by 1.5 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended stable, but Dutch red sugar spot goods rose by one and a half jiao due to a shortage.

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Power of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>This year is the Women's National Products Year, and it seems that these mediocre women should devote their patriotic enthusiasm to buying national products. However, in reality, it is unexpected. Recently, the International Trade Bureau announced that the import of women's cosmetics such as rouge and perfume in China has reached 850,000 in half a year, which is nearly more than last year's 1.5 million, and there is a trend of "later overtaking". In June alone, the import of perfume and rouge reached 70,334 gold units, equivalent to 144,044 yuan in national currency; and the number of lace for fashionable women's clothing was even more surprising, with a total of 577,962 yuan in national currency imported in six months of this year.</p>
<p>No wonder many people admire modern women not only for their enchanting power, but also for their economic "power." It is worth remembering that not long ago, because women generally liked to go barefoot in summer and did not wear stockings or silk stockings, the business of several sock factories in this city suddenly declined, so they sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Executive Yuan to ban women's bizarre costumes in order to get relief. The slightest decoration and clothing of women can make the market sluggish and cause a huge leak in the country's foreign trade. How can this not be said that women have great economic "power"!</p>
<p>Indeed, some modern women's socks are related to the prosperity and decline of the market and the country's financial plan, which is indeed an economic power; but looking at its essence through a "Western mirror", it is not the luck of modern women. Because the current depression of all industries has reached the point of "getting worse", while women's beauty and appearance are "getting better", this is definitely not the result of shouting "equality between men and women" and "women's economic independence" in recent years, but a living drama of selling oneself for glory and dancing on foreign coins.</p>
<p>Economic panic reduces the production of the entire society, which in turn lowers the status of women. This has become the root cause of the unique prosperity of some women who are afraid of not being fashionable, while most people are standing on tiptoe, working hard. Because most women nowadays admire "Su Ji Zi's wealth and gold", and those who can wear skirts and cloth hairpins and "weep in a cow clothing" are really hard to find even if they break their straw shoes. This makes friends living in "small rooms" break the illusion of "Scholar Zhang", and what appears in women's eyes is that only rich and young people can become a happy son-in-law of "naked belly on the east bed". However, in order to tie the hearts of such men, many women have to compete for the exquisiteness of decoration. Those who are waiting for a price to be estimated want to pursue it, and those who already have a home need to be stable, and for many who are involved in the "social" field, decoration has become their profession. As this trend arrives, foreign rouge and Parisian perfume have become necessities for women that "cannot be separated for a moment". This is why the number of cosmetics imported is so alarming, and the reason why it cannot be saved is equal to the fact that women have to be modern in order to sell themselves. Regardless of how beautiful the propaganda of "Women's National Products Year" and "promoting national products" sounds, it cannot change the habit of women using dressing as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>Therefore, this kind of economic "power" of women is actually a power crawling under the economy. Rather than saying that it can enable women to achieve equality between men and women, it is better to say that it increases the nature of women being played with. Many women who are fortunate enough to be displayed at fashion exhibitions, please put down your arrogant psychology of looking down on everything and think about the objective significance of this situation.</p>
<h3>Returning Home at Night</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Treading on the moonlight, with a sad heart, I returned from my aunt's house. I like walking at night. The bright moon hangs over my head, trampling on my own shadow, listening to the chirping of insects in the fields, as if I were in a precious painting, walking forward on the path. Occasionally, a few barks of dogs in the distance are like black shadows shaking in front of that thatched cottage. If it is a full moon, the wind blows the rice waves, and my steps become light and elegant, and my courage is so great. Especially in summer, I am disturbed by mosquitoes at night and cannot sleep soundly. Although the people living together are enjoying the cool in the courtyard, I hate them, I hate them for endlessly telling stories that people do not want to hear, or talking bad about the east family and the west family. In fact, our courtyard is quite large, with a flowered wall on three sides and some miscellaneous flowers planted, but it is already very precious in the countryside. In the middle, there are three pots of lotus flowers, and bursts of fragrance come to the nose with the wind, which can also invigorate people's spirits. In such a quiet environment, you can each drag a chair and sit on the four sides, waving the palm fan in your hand at will, or looking up at the clear moon without a cloud, how leisurely and洒脱. Those weaving girls鳴時時時時花在花中時鳴時歇,彷彿音樂 music, we should lean ears to listen, the fatigue of the day, at this time forgot to clean. However, as soon as you step into the courtyard in front of the window, it is like entering a traveling theater. I often turn around and go for a walk in the fields alone. I like walking at night and this has become a habit.</p>
<p>This morning, a servant from my aunt's house came to ask me to go, saying that my cousin had returned home for summer vacation. I grew up in my aunt's house, and my aunt is like my mother. My cousin is five years older than me, and she treats me, this younger brother, like her own brother. My aunt also made a joke, saying that Yu Jie would be your wife, but this is an impossible fact. We only know "to be good", and know other things. Later, as I grew older, I seemed to fall in love with my cousin. At that time, I went to Shanghai to study, and after we separated, we became estranged when we met. In fact, each other's age is also the reason for the estrangement. I can only have admiration for my cousin.</p>
<p>Last year, she got married, and I had a small exam at school. My aunt wrote several letters, but I couldn't return home once. To this day, I still seem to be unable to let go of this matter. Now that I am on summer vacation at home, I went to her house at noon. My aunt still patted me on the shoulder and touched my face when she saw me. She was very happy that I graduated this year and asked me if I would go to university. My cousin was thin, and she avoided me when she saw me.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went fishing in the back river alone. The peach tree that we planted by hand in the beginning has already blossomed and borne fruit. Remembering that life is like morning dew, I really want to cry. At this time, my aunt ran over and sat by the river. She talked from afar, talking about my cousin, saying that her husband was dissolute, gambled, and prostituted, a bad guy who did everything. My cousin repeatedly advised him not to listen, and was so angry that he became ill, and his words were sad. I listened in a daze, and the fishing rod almost slipped out of my hand.</p>
<p>After dinner, my cousin asked me in a low voice to go for a cool air. I followed her to the courtyard without hesitation. It was like my home there, with many people sitting in a noisy manner. When they saw my cousin, they hurriedly gave up their seats and chatted. We couldn't say a word to each other.</p>
<p>I said goodbye and came out. My aunt asked me to stay overnight. I didn't answer, and my cousin watched me off at the gate of the courtyard. Treading on the moonlight, with a sad heart, I returned from my aunt's house. The tranquility of the fields no longer aroused my interest, and I bowed my head to miss the equally sad heart over there!</p>
<h3>Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>Fantasy is similar to dreaming. No matter who it is, they will inevitably have moments of wild thoughts in their minds; however, because these thoughts are mostly related to their own fame and fortune, it is rare to express them in words and tell others nakedly.</p>
<p>Now, I will break the rule and talk about a little bit of my fantasy here.</p>
<p>For several months, I have often thought this way: I am a person who makes a living by writing. Even if I am blessed by God, I can earn thirty or twenty yuan a month to live on. I am confined to my residence all day long, eating, sleeping, reading, and writing. Even if I live to be a hundred years old, how much stuff can I come up with? Moreover, the scope of life is so narrow, and no matter how many topics are changed, they will never come up with a new pattern; for example, flowers, moons, cold, heat, poverty, suffering, ... are these things not often seen at the pen tips of ordinary people all year round? If the topics are used up one day, and you have to eat, then you have no choice but to plagiarize and copy other people's things, or specialize in fabricating facts and peeking at the small loopholes in someone's articles to use as your own writing material. What is the meaning of living like this?</p>
<p>"The way of life must be changed, whether it is being an official, farming, doing business, being a hired worker, ..." I feel this deeply; however, I have neither the ability of a sharp-pointed trowel, nor</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>no large amount of capital, or a close relationship with a rich businessman or a big official, so naturally I can't be an official, and I can't do business; as for farming and being a hired worker, I naturally can't realize it if I don't have three or five acres of fertile land, strong arms, and a tall body. Thinking repeatedly, I can't think of a better way to go. In the end, I don't know how, but I even thought of walking all over the country on foot. I thought that, like a tramp, begging from one township to another, from one town to another, if my life does not starve to death, freeze to death, or be killed by wild beasts and robbers, I would go into the rural areas that have suffered from natural and man-made disasters for many years, see how the hard-working and frugal old farmers look, climb over mountains above five thousand feet, taste the taste of the cold winter night sky, walk along the river and lake under the sunset, go deep into the verdant forests, majestic and dangerous valleys, ... see what the scenery there is like, After three or five years, it will not be in vain for a person who loves literature to taste hardship! Although, in the present China, it is not easy to realize this desire for a poor person, even if he travels on foot; however, if you are willing to risk your life, there may be a little hope of realizing it.</p>
<p>I very much hope that this little fantasy of mine can be realized. I don't know if there is anyone else who has the same idea and is willing to be my travel companion?</p>
<p>P.S. I plan to realize this wish of mine around September 10th. If anyone also loves this way and is willing to be a companion, please send a letter to He Juefu, Fudan University, so that we can make an appointment to discuss it further.</p>
<h3>Sharing Watermelon—Thoughts on Eating Watermelon—</h3>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>I was awakened by the alarm clock at five o'clock. I raised my head and looked at the bed opposite, and my brother was also looking at me with a smile. This seems to have become a habit. I put my feet on the ground and hurriedly opened the window, letting the stale air from the previous night be replaced by fresh air. I took a deep breath against the window, and my hands waved in a way that was not at all regular; however, this is not the training ground, and there is no physical education teacher shouting one, two, three, so no matter how much you mess around, it is hygienic.</p>
<p>I rinsed my mouth and washed my face with cold water, and sometimes I wiped my upper and lower body. The two brothers took the teapot and went out. In front of the door is a shallow stream, and several willows are planted by the stream, whispering to the water from time to time with the morning breeze. The cicadas are already making noise on the treetops, knowing and knowing, do you know that autumn is coming, and your life is short in a moment?</p>
<p>Standing on the wooden bridge, I stared at the school of fish in the stream, they were so lively competing for the food floating on the water. After a while, they hid in the bottom of the river, like a shy virgin. Here, there is never a trace of fishermen, and they live their lives in逍遥自在.</p>
<p>Walking forward along the river bank on the opposite bank, the thatched huts are all familiar faces, and a smile is a greeting. They can't say "Good morning, sir!" The clothes from the night before are busy washing, and today's meal has to be cooked before sunrise, so when we return, they have already gone to the market town to do business.</p>
<p>I don't know when a little black dog followed us. Grabbing its front paws and wagging its tail, it was very affectionate. The dogs in the countryside are so cute. Although they will jump up and bark a few times when they see strangers, they don't hope to sit in a car, eat milk biscuits, and if they drop a little white rice, they will guard your door every day.</p>
<p>To the teahouse, this tea house is also three thatched huts. One is the tea seat, one is the residence of the shop owner, they are a couple and a twelve-year-old son, and the other is selling soy milk in the morning and snacks in the afternoon, and also running all kinds of Beijing groceries: however, as long as you say the name of the shop, Lao Wanxing, everyone in the neighborhood knows and understands. Many letters are forwarded from here every day. At this time, there are already several tea customers with their upper bodies exposed and their legs bare in the tea seat, and they are all familiar faces.</p>
<p>"Three officials, five officials, good morning!" Taking the teapot, giving four copper coins, Lao Wanxing always says this sentence.</p>
<p>"Busy!" is our answer.</p>
<p>It has become a habit to say this every day, but it is not annoying, and both sides feel very 친절한; or it is because of the straightforwardness of the country people.</p>
<p>Taking the bean curd and returning the same way, the big sun has already探起 from the east, and the dewdrops on the weeds along the way are shining. The little boat of the fisherman who touches the fish has just rowed out, and the old Li with white hair must be smiling and saying: "I will go to hear Da Hongpao again tonight, and I will break the White Sparrow Temple."</p>
<p>My hand tightened, and his boat shot like an arrow from behind us.</p>
<p>Lao Wanxing's teahouse always invites a running dockworker to talk about cause and effect every summer, and five copper coins can listen for an hour. It is very crowded every night, and some people bring their own benches. There is nothing to do in the countryside, and they come to listen every night and become addicted.</p>
<p>Returning home, the whole family has gotten up. We move all the flowers in the yard to the study, which is also a hobby of our two brothers. But when it comes to flowers, it is really embarrassing, they are all those balsam, cockscomb and so on. Later, we asked for a few wax reds, which have been regarded as precious flower species.</p>
<p>Last night, I read my fifth brother's letter under the lamp. He said that my beloved single-braided wax red withered, and the old Li, who was more than sixty years old, was caught and died in prison for only one night because of the field rent. He was a bachelor, and the neighbors collected money to buy a coffin and bury him. He said that the teahouse will not invite anyone to talk about cause and effect this year, and there is nothing to do at night. He hopes that the newspapers and magazines that I have read will be sent to him a little every week...</p>
<p>I didn't sleep well all night last night, and even the accordion next door became a novice, so annoying.</p>
<h3>Soviet Youth's Flying Game (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— (Moscow Correspondent Yin Yuan)</p>
<p>(1) Parachute Jump</p>
<p>An airplane slowly rotates above the green airplane field. The huge humming sound emitted by the airplane is not very clear to the people near the huge (I) character. This airplane, seen from below, looks like a carnivorous bird with its wings spread. On one of the wings, a tiny shadow crawled out of the cabin, jumped down, and plunged headfirst into the void. The attention of the audience below is focused on this tiny shadow floating in the air.</p>
<p>"Has this thing opened or not?" In the instant after this figure fell, a large umbrella opened on his body, and the shadow hung under the umbrella and gradually fell to the ground. This parachute shone a rainbow in the bright sunshine and swayed down steadily. The shadow of this parachute jump can already be identified in the clear half-sky. Finally, it landed, and the parachute swaying in the wind opened above his head like a tent. He quickly took the umbrella and packed it up.</p>
<p>At this time, the crowd rushed forward and shouted: "How is it?"</p>
<p>"Very good, I came down very smoothly," the man replied, pretending to be calm, to replace his smug pride. Such pride is deserved and allowed. This is an unforgettable day, the day of his first parachute jump, and now he has the right to hang the green badge of the parachute jump on his chest, which is a badge of courage and skill.</p>
<h3>Underground</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>It's about five o'clock. The stars in the sky are vaguely blurred, and the fish-white light gradually appears on the eastern horizon. In the fields, on the grasslands, and in the jungles, countless sparrows are flying. The flowing water in the small river glistens under the morning light, and the black shadows covering the mountains, forests, and plains have dissipated. Dawn, this quiet and peaceful dawn has come to the world.</p>
<p>The long and strange cry of the steam whistle awakened the people in the villages and tile houses near and far in the mountains and forests. They know that this is the signal of the arrival of dawn, and the time for them to start operating every day has come.</p>
<p>The chimneys on the tile houses began to release wisps of white smoke. Women and children are doing their housework, and strong men are all taking up the tools of their work—gas lamps and small iron hoes—and heading towards the mine. On the small paths of the plain, rows of them seem to be a marching army.</p>
<p>On that hillside, on the four sides of the railway, workers are everywhere. The wheels are rumbling, and the elevators are spitting out groups of tired and panting workers from the depths of the ground, thousands of feet or hundreds of feet below, and newly sucking in groups of energetic people.</p>
<p>They, leaving the natural world, the resting place of mankind at dawn, are sent to this world thousands of feet or hundreds of feet below the ground for the sake of life. There is no sun, no sky, no mountains, and no rivers. It is just gloomy, full of dirty and wet mud, and dark all around with stench and coal dust. This is another world, another human world.</p>
<p>The whistle of the steam whistle cannot be heard, and people's laughter cannot be heard. Filling the underground is some breathing, exertion, and the slight sound of walking. Occasionally, a loud sound is the sound of the coal seam collapsing. In this sound, some people will lose their lives.</p>
<p>Leaving nature, leaving the human world, in this deep underground, there are tens of thousands of people working all day long. They lost the guarantee of life, lost the light of the sun, sold their strength and lives for the sake of life, and worked forever in this underground.</p>

<h3>One Night (6) Li Huaiying</h3>
<p>The other four welcomed her as if they were receiving a warrior who had returned victoriously from the battlefield. They shouted in unison and gathered around the table. Mrs. Zheng's two daughters, one eleven years old and the other nine years old, were originally playing in the alley. When they saw Mrs. Xing buying wine, they guessed that there would be something to eat, which moved their little appetites, so they followed and ran in.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you playing? What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng questioned her two children sternly when she saw them. Her intention was not to let the children watch them drink. She wanted to drive the two children out and then said:</p>
<p>"Go out and play!"</p>
<p>The children didn't leave. They didn't want to go back outside empty-handed. Mrs. Liu saw the children's eyes fixed on these things and saw their little demands. She grabbed a handful of peanuts and sent the two children away.</p>
<p>"Let's drink."</p>
<p>Mrs. Xing suggested. When she said this, she seemed to have made a great determination, and her face was wrinkled tightly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ning said with a smile:</p>
<p>"How can we drink without glasses?"</p>
<p>"Do you still need a glass? Why be so polite! If you don't need a glass, can't you drink directly from the bottle?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun said fiercely, as if she was angry with someone.</p>
<p>That's what they did. The corks of the three bottles were opened one after another, and the five of them passed them around and drank.</p>
<p>Except for Mrs. Zheng and Mrs. Chuang, who had a three-cup capacity, the remaining three had never let their lips touch a wine glass on weekdays. This time, they were desperate to drink to relieve their sorrows.</p>
<p>The wine was sweet, the heart was bitter, and the tears were salty. They poured it in, burned it, and flowed it out. Gradually, their faces turned red, their mouths were dry, and their heads were heavy.</p>
<p>"I don't believe we should starve to death!"</p>
<p>"Xinjiang, what kind of place is Xinjiang? Why don't people go to fight Japan in that place, but fight among themselves?..."</p>
<p>"Let's get drunk, let's get drunk, it's better to get through this day."</p>
<p>Drinking and talking, gradually, some people felt that the people in front of them began to sway, and the house was also spinning. Mrs. Xing, Mrs. Ning, and Mrs. Sun dropped their wine bottles and fell on the bed, with saliva foaming at the corners of their mouths. After vomiting for a while, they vomited a large pile of food, which flowed all over their faces and beds. Mrs. Zheng and Mrs. Liu originally wanted to help them, but they fell on the bed unconsciously.</p>
<p>The whole house was filled with a strong smell of alcohol.</p>
<p>The night is deep, the night is deep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Zheng's two children walked upstairs singing songs. They were ready to go to bed. A little cat sneaked into the house from somewhere before them. It sniffed around the house with its inspired nose for a while, and then quietly sneaked out again. (End)</p>
<p>Announcement The author's original intention in writing this novel was only to make the world understand the plight of the anti-Japanese relatives in Shanghai. There was no malice. Yesterday, I heard from my friend Mr. Li that I realized that it caused a misunderstanding and was considered to be intentionally insulting. This was due to not understanding the author's original intention. I hereby declare and apologize. Li Huaiying respectfully</p>

<h3>A HOLLYWOOD WIFE'S CONFESSION (PART TWO)</h3>
<p>— MI QI</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Being a Famous Movie Star's Wife: Please Read Carefully to Understand the Truth</p>
<p>Later, we moved into a large house with eighteen rooms, complete with gardens, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and so on. But in many ways, it felt like a prison. What was the point of such a hollow place? Todd was always busy, rarely having time to be with me. Thankfully, he adored our children. That was at least somewhat comforting. Once, on Christmas Eve, we held a party at our house. Our guests arrived one by one. We had just come downstairs when we overheard someone among the guests asking, "Did you know about Freeland and Sylvia Sheila's affair? I wonder how Freeland's wife feels?" Suddenly, they saw us and became extremely embarrassed. I leaned on the railing, pretending to be nonchalant, and laughed, "She's furious! She's so angry that she eats children like you for breakfast every morning!" With that, a small storm passed. Everyone raised their eyebrows, as if saying "Oh," but the atmosphere calmed down, though my feet were ice cold. That night, after the guests left, Todd hugged me and kissed the tip of my ear, saying, "You truly are an impenetrable fortress." He only said those words, but I felt it was the closest thing we'd had in months.</p>
<p>Later, the company boss wanted to send him on a trip to the Midwest and East Coast. I accompanied him. When we set off, I felt it was the happiest day since Todd became a star. However, that joy was fleeting. When we arrived at San Bernardino, it all dissipated. He was reading a news item aloud with me… when suddenly four girls! As delicate as rosebuds! Burst into our compartment. Their glittering eyes were full of adoration. Their luscious red lips trembled with emotion. I believe they didn't even notice me. Todd signed his name on their books for each of them; patted one of their hands for something she said; then dismissed them. From that moment on, I could never return to my former self. Suddenly, I felt an indescribable weariness. I thought, even if I had the strength to fight one woman and keep my husband, how could I fight all the women in the world? But it felt like that was exactly what I had to do. Women came in droves to surround him. At one stop, Todd was helping me off the train, but a woman pulled his arm and dragged him away. I didn't see him again for two hours. He ran to the hotel, saw me, and laughed, "Look at me, don't I look like a scarecrow made of souvenirs?" I took a closer look, and it was true. His bow tie was gone, his collar was torn, and the buttons on his clothes had all vanished. At the next stop, it was even worse. Many policemen protected him as he disembarked. Entering and exiting theaters also required the special protection of the police. One evening, we were in the inn, exhausted after a hard day. Todd cradled my chin and kissed me like a child. Ah! It had been so long since that had happened. I thought I had finally won. Suddenly, behind us came a long "Ah..." Two women laughed and popped out, having snuck in and hidden behind the sofa. I felt like I didn't have any private time anymore. He belonged to every woman...</p>
<p>In the end, I didn't accompany Todd back to Hollywood, because the company had an urgent matter that required him to return, and my sister was ill and needed me to take care of her. Thus, we were separated for another two months. On the day I returned, Todd threw a grand party for me at home. Big names and stars walked in and out of our house, wearing out the doorsteps. I was happy, but extremely tired, only hoping they would leave early so that Todd and I could rest and be intimate. That night, after two o'clock, the guests left, and as I was unpacking my luggage, he said to me, "Darling, I'm so sorry. But it's all over. I can't go on like this forever." I asked, "Are you talking about Sylvia?" He said, "No. It's Janice Morgan." Janice Morgan! A middle-aged woman, known as America's greatest seductress! Many people had committed suicide for her. Of course, Todd wasn't willing to mention divorce. Mentioning divorce would be detrimental to his career, and might even ruin Janice's.</p>
<p>My only hope now is that one day, Todd will change his mind and return to me. We still attend parties, film screenings, and press previews as usual. My job is to stand at the door beside my husband, showing ourselves off to everyone passing by; and I must wear that content smile… The purpose is to silence all rumor-mongers. But when no one is watching, I slip away, go out the back door and go home… alone. Wife? No! I am a half-dead, numb, soulless phantom. I am just a windbreak for a big Hollywood star." (The End)</p>

<h3>REVIEW OF "THE FAITHFUL HEART"</h3>
<p>— LUO PING</p>
<p>ONCE TO EVERY WOMAN</p>
<p>丨CATHAY FILM</p>
<p>"The Faithful Heart," like "It Happened One Night," is based on a story from Cosmopolitan magazine. However, there is a significant difference between A. J. Cronin and S. H. Adams. At the very least, Cronin's serious approach to creation in "The Faithful Heart" is worth our attention.</p>
<p>"The Faithful Heart" shares some similarities with "Remedy for Love," both demanding that doctors be conscientious about life and fulfill their duty to save humanity.</p>
<p>Here, it curses the derelict and selfish doctors, satirizes the arrogant and jealous head of surgery, and denounces the callous nurses who lack compassion for patients.</p>
<p>It depicts the love of an old married couple who are sometimes fighting and sometimes loving. The pain of a dancer whose face is disfigured by acid, sacrificing in a capitalist society, the deep affection between a young, poor, and sick couple who say to the doctor, "Saving her is saving my youth," and these descriptions are all very light, delicate, vivid, and truthful. We can see the director's cleverness here.</p>
<p>The subjective opinion of the playwright of "The Faithful Heart" demands that doctors and nurses be conscientious about life and fulfill their duty to save "humanity," although the term "humanity" is still problematic. We acknowledge that the playwright's opinion is acceptable.</p>
<p>However, we also know that the demands of the playwright of "The Faithful Heart" cannot be separated from the demands of overall social reform, but Cronin has not understood this point. His fantasy is only to have these two doctors and nurses who fulfill their duty to save "humanity" be perfectly united under the existing social system, which cannot be said to be shortsighted.</p>
<p>The achievements of "The Faithful Heart," the contributions of director Lambert Hillyer and screenwriter Jo Swerling, cannot be denied. The handling is very economical, smooth, and crisp. Especially the handling of the section where the patient is undergoing surgery, the tense work in the room, the rapid expansion and contraction of the breathing ball, the descent of the measuring table and the rapid breathing sound, the panicked situation of the observers on the roof and the anxious inner description of the patient's husband tightly grasping the curtains in the next room, are like ten thousand tons of lead and iron tightly pressing on the audience's breath.</p>
<p>The actors are all average. Fay Wray and Walter Byron are the best, but Ralph Bellamy, who plays Burke, is a little lacking.</p>
<p>In the midst of the demands for realism in film, this film, which touches on some truth and is relatively satisfactory, is commendable.</p>

<h3>"NEW WOMAN" DIRECTOR IS REFRESHED</h3>
<p>Although "New Woman," one of Lianhua's major productions this year, has not yet started filming, audiences who care about Lianhua's productions have long known that it is a great work of triple stars: Sun Shiyi writing the script, Cai Chusheng directing, and Ruan Lingyu starring. Because Director Cai demanded that everything about his new work be new, he had been working day and night for more than twenty days to use his agile brain, to the point where he almost became an "old man," unkempt and unshaven. But now he has solved all the difficult problems he was thinking about, so he has restored his original appearance, refreshed, and radiant, still a young man in his prime.</p>
<h3>"THE BIG ROAD" INSPECTION TEAM RETURNS LOADED</h3>
<p>Lianhua's major production, Sun Yu's new work "The Big Road," returned safely to Shanghai on the evening of the sixth day after the organization of the inspection team set off for the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road for location shooting. This trip covered more than three thousand three hundred miles, with footprints all over the two provinces. Everyone who returned was happy and returned with a full load: what they had in common was that the magnificent, majestic, winding, secluded scenery along the way gave them unexpected gains; what they had separately was that Factory Director Lu and Director Sun picked up countless colorful, crystal-clear small stones in the mountain streams of Huangshan, Qiu Yiwei's camera pre-loaded with beautiful negatives, and Meng Junmou carried a large bag of famous Huizhou fruits.</p>

<h3>A GOOD SON AND A GOOD WIFE (BORN TO BE KISSED) (9)</h3>
<p>— XIN ZHI</p>
<p>This place is really like a palace, Edie thought. Looking up at the high ceilings and down at all the luxurious furnishings, it was so lovely. They walked to a wing room, which Pan Qi said was his son's private room, a place where others were not allowed to go. Edie heard this and felt happy in her heart, so she strolled in and ran to the balcony, overlooking the shimmering water below. Pan Qi saw her go in and whispered to his son, "You must go to Washington by the end of this week. You go figure it out." After he finished speaking, he walked away. Edie turned around and saw that only Tom was left, so she asked curiously, "Where's your father?" Tom said, "He went to check the luggage." He casually picked up a photo album and handed it to Edie to look at. Edie flipped through it and saw a small photo inside, a child, held by a nanny, smiling widely. Edie asked, "Is this you?" Tom nodded and said, "I think you must have been very pretty when you were little." He looked at her as if he loved her very much. Edie said, "Unfortunately, I can't prove it. My family is very poor and doesn't have money for photos." She then told Tom about her family. Her father's story, her mother's story..., and even her encounter and engagement with Chris, she revealed everything. She even showed Tom the ring on her hand. After hearing what she had to say, Tom's heart felt something, so he stared at her blankly, without saying a word. After a while, Edie slowly said, "Your father doesn't like me." Tom said, "Of course he likes you very much. You are the first of my girlfriends that he has invited home." After a while, he took her hand again and said, "Don't worry. Come on. There are still many places you haven't seen yet." He opened a door, and inside was a bedroom. She went in to take a look and couldn't help but admire it.</p>
<p>The sound of a car startled her. She climbed to the window and looked out. A car was parked below her, with luggage piled in the front, and Pan Qi was sitting in the back, leaving. Edie couldn't help but yell, "Pan Qi is crazy!" Pan Qi waved his hand with a smile and said, "Edie, goodbye!" Edie turned around and said angrily to Tom, "This is what you did, isn't it?" Tom said, "Hey, we haven't been alone together yet." Edie said, "Of course not! Don't even think about it! I'm going home!" She turned the doorknob, but the door wouldn't open. Edie said angrily to Tom, "Open the door quickly." Tom said sharply, "Honey, you don't have to be angry." Edie blushed and scolded, "You are such a heartless person. Bringing me to this place, making fun of me for not having a big house on Pike Street, making fun of me for not having a powerful family to back me up!" Tom said, "I don't want to do anything to you..." Edie shouted, "Of course you can't do anything to me! I'm not afraid of you either! I've encountered this kind of thing before! I can protect myself!" Tom looked amused and said, "Tell me! You adorable thing!" Edie continued, "You have always been able to get whatever you want, and you are satisfied, but you have not understood one thing, that you are not the only one who has feelings, other people have them too." She pulled her own hair and said, "My hair has color, that's right. I look a bit like a woman of questionable character, that's right. No one thinks of me as anything good, but I have never looked down on myself!" Her temples were trembling with anger. Tom said, "You don't need to coax me. Aren't you and I both living people!" Edie helplessly pleaded again, "Tom, please forgive me! Why won't you help me a little?" (To be continued)</p>
