<p>（日内瓦）南斯位夫對馬賽血案申訴匃牙利引起之中歐風雲今漸消散、匃國已在今日國聯行政院會議中接受關於此事之决議案、其中規定如下、（一）對恐怖主義作一般的譴責、（二）匃國應澈查若干官員疏忽之行爲、而加以懲處、（三）國聯行政院應設立委員會考慮關於恐布黨暴行之一切問題尤其爲政治犯逋逃數之權利與濫用一端、（　日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院今晚一致通過决議案一件、結束南斯拉夫申請案之辯論、其内容先對馬春被剌之南斯拉夫國干王亞歷山大及法國外長巴爾都表示敬意、嗣謂任何國家不當爲政治上目的而在其國境内鼓勵或容忍恐怖主義派之活動、對於恐怖行爲事前當加預防、事後則當懲治、不可稍有忽略、若遇他國要求並當不吝援助、此固任何國家應有之職責也、行政院兹根據南斯拉夫交來文件、覺與南斯拉夫境外恐怖主義份子之生存及活動有關之各種問題未經適當解决、以使南斯拉夫政府感覺滿意、而匈牙利若干官吏、至少因疏忽之故　對於馬賽兇案之籌備担負責任、本院深信匈國政府定能自知在國際上所負責任、而其職責係在迅速採取或促使採取種種措置、俾對罪狀確定之官吏加以制裁、並深信匈國政府之意志、係在履行此項職責、用特請其將日後所當採取之措置隨時通知本院云云、行政院最後議决設立專家委員會、對於訂立圖際公約以懲治政治恐怖主義之企圖及罪行一問題、担任研究、此項委員會將以比·英·智利·西班牙·法·匈·意波蘭·羅馬尼亞·瑞士·及蘇聯十一國代表組成之、並向行政院提出報告書云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯因辦理匈南間之爭案與薩爾警務事件獲有良好之結果、近今稍損之聲威已爲恢復、行政院今已延會至一月十日、於是將於蕯爾公民投票進行之際繼續集議、南斯拉夫外交部今日對國聯關於匈南爭執之决議案表示滿意、南國京城各報盛歡賀該案之解决匃國京城各報亦頗欣謝、並稱讚英掌璽大臣艾登之應變有方、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞外相一言驚四座</h3>
<p>主席言國聯有辦事能力</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院今日午後重開會議時、羅馬尼亞外相蒂杜萊斯科發言痛詆匈國、謂國聯前匈代表亞邦伊伯爵之逝世、彼等前從未覺得若此之損失伯爵恒根據於初從事討論、血匈國評論家今日則遭挑撥之無謂讉責、渠久寓英國與瑞土、試問兩國歷史有容逋逃犯携帶軍械及以軍械子彈與炸藥練習　乎　羅外相並告匈人、對於此事、當以國家榮譽爲念、行政院諸理事聞羅外相之言顯多侷促不安、意代表阿洛錫凝視天花板法外是賴伐爾從事剔牙、英掌璽大臣艾登則頻頻視其指甲、羅外相繼稱匈政府縱未與克羅特族之逋逃客相接觸、然就其責任而言、難辭疏忽之咎、至於修正和約一節、要知今日量般民衆皆以爲維持現局、足致安寗彼不滿竟於目前之界綫者、在各國中、僅佔甚少數耳、羅外相末謂匈牙利實爲修正和約運動之最積極與最熱烈的中心點</p>
<p>據克外長皮尼士博士繼起向衆致詞、惟其語調視蒂杜萊斯科者温和　僅反對修正和平運動、並懇國聯行政院設法使南斯拉夫滿意</p>
<p>南斯拉夫外相葉維蒂志宣稱　匈牙和答覆南國申訴之備忘録、一味否認、且於指南國此奉、不過爲小恊約國政治的策略一節、絲毫未有佐證、南國逋逃犯在匈設立機關兩年之久、而匈政府始承認知之、並需七個月清理該機關、其不顧信義、卽此可見一斑、南政府爲恐怖黨事向匈政府申訴、已達五年以上、而匈政府僅處理一案、但與案有關之恐怖黨人猶在、就逮之前逃失在所云</p>
<p>少數民族委員會匈牙利代表愛克哈特起稱、逋兆犯問題、今漸見惡化、南斯拉夫政府允停止驅逐匈僑、迄未遵行云</p>
<p>行政院集議畢、諸代表遂舉行非公開會議、討論决議草案之措詞、該草案已由匈代表電達其本國政府、今晚國聯行政院集議時、將正式提出、</p>
<p>所商妥之墓案其中遺責馬賽血案、並謂無國能漠視似可防杜此種罪惡將　重見之任何計晝國聯行政院所聆之辯論、與所接之公文　均表明匈國若干官員對於與釀成馬賽血案陰謀有關之事務、實　疏忽彼等之職責、國聯行政院希望匈政府履行其國際義務、並以加於弱職官員之適當懲治報告國聯行政院、國聯行政院以爲國際公法、關於取締恐布黨活動之條規、不足担保有效之國際合作、故决議設立專家委員會、研究該問題、以期卓定關於此事之國際公約云云、</p>
<p>國聯行政院主席結束今日之辯論時宣稱國聯　證明其有辦事能力云、</p>
<p>一般人士初恐匈政府對於决議草案中所述若干匈員責任問題、將持異議、旋聞匈政府已接受該草案　乃大滿意、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>妥恊之成立</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯方面今日對於南斯拉夫匃牙利之爭執曾有長時間之磋商　其中以法外長賴伐爾·英代表艾登·及意代表阿樂西三人最爲努力　計自清晨開始至午後始告結束、當卽成立一種調解新方案、一方面綏和南斯拉夫之憤激、一方面復不至多傷匃牙利之情感、此項方案規定如下（一）　於馬賽慘案應公布一種正式而空泛之罪言並組織一國際法庭、專司審理恐怖行爲、（二）國聯會員國之土地完整不得以非法手段横肆侵略、此點應載入國聯議事記録（三）根據已得之證據、匃牙利對於取締克羅特人恐怖組織　確有疏忽之愆故匃牙利焉府應卽對於負責官員迅速加以檢舉、上述議决草案、各國初以爲措詞其爲圓活、可望南匃雙方同意不意徵求南匃同意之時、雙方覺各執一詞不甘示弱匃牙利旣不願公然受取締疏忽之指斥、南拉斯夫則堅持非嚴厲懲處關係方面不可嗣經英法意三大、政　家排解、此妥協案始得成立、今日午後國聯行政院重行開會時、羅馬尼亞所長鐵杜萊斯利復對於匃牙利提出嚴厲之詰質、羅馬尼亞之贊助南斯拉夫固屬意中事惟如鐵杜婁斯哥氏措詞之嚴厲、則殊出人意料之外云、鐵氏繼續提及修　和約問題、稱按諸國聯盟約第十九條、凡現行條約之修改、必須由於國聯會員國全體一致　過始可、關係國家亦在其内、如此修改條約始爲合法、而一切修改條約之鼓吹、則屬非法、因實違反國聯盟約、而國聯盟約固以保障各國領土完整爲宗旨者也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法國今日以關於締結國際公約規定逋逃藪權利與取締濫用之備忘録提交國聯行政院　備忘録中涉及政治性質之恐怖主義　如希圖暗殺國家元首政府領袖公共官吏及政見不同之私人之類、並反對搗亂行爲及恐怖黨團體與宣傳、備忘録規定凡違背國際公約之案件、得請求海牙國際法庭審判、凡受讉責之人、僅得由國聯行政院寬恕、國聯各會員國對於政治暗殺犯、應供給引渡之便利云、國聯行政院似將舉派小委員會考慮法國所提議之國際公約事（十日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）昨晚國聯行政院院散會之際、法國外長賴伐爾對於匈南二國贊成决議案之賢明態度、加以稱道、並謂一國聯會又一次不辱高尙使命、維持和平厥功甚偉云云、繼賴伐爾發言者爲意代表阿樂亞西及行政院主席葡萄牙代表華斯貢塞洛斯　均向英代表艾登稱謝、旋卽宣告散會、行政院本日開會時、將討論薩爾問題、事後本屆非常會議、卽告終結、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>據日内瓦路透訪員電稱、荷蘭瑞典均接受國聯之請書、允派隊伍加入國際警隊、薩爾管理委員會主席諾克斯爲英人、故英國所派人數將獨多、按該警隊總額爲四千人、</p>

<p>羅馬　此間半官方面對於外傳意大利戌軍越界至阿北西尼亞致生衡突一節、力加否認並稱、此實係阿比西及亞兵携機關槍多架及野戰砲一尊　向意屬地蘇莫列蘭襲擊而起、嗣由救援到達始將阿軍擊退、至謡傳英人加入一層、尤爲不可能之事、因英國之阿比亞尼亞邊境委員團係於前十二天經過奥拉爾者也、（十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>美國貨幣政策</h3>
<p>目前無意貶抑元價</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社調查公私意見後　得悉政府現在無意再使美元貶價　但至少尙有兩種情形、可使羅斯福總統贊成美元貶價、（一）如歐洲之法國等金本位國家放棄金本位國家放棄金本位、則美元亦可乘機與全世界貨幣同時貶價、（二）如時機成熟、則羅總統决不猶豫繼使美元貶價、以求穩定國際貨幣據美聯社消息、政府確定反對通貨膨脹、官方宣稱、上屆國會通過之三·○○○·○○○·○○○元紙幣至今尚未發行、但政府贊成借欵膨脹云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>新生活中之集團結婚恒·</h3>
<p>本市社會局鑒於社會［習俗日趨者侈。結婚費用。動輒數千。］故特擬訂集團結婚辦法。以崇節約而挽頽風。其中所擬各點。法良意美。殊足稱道。洵一移風易俗之善舉也。</p>
<p>婚烟爲人生大事。亦爲一維持家庭制度。安定社會生活之應盡的手續。然其事過難。則易使曠夫怨女之數額增益不已。其事過易。則將使夫婦離各無常。家庭基礎。隨之摇動。過與不及。皆足爲助長社會罪惡之因素。面而危及民族生命之繁榮。今日奢糜成風。大都會中尤重浮夸。結婚所費。動逾數千。中下階級。欲勉撑塲面。每多爲婚姻而負債。言其個人。則一生受累。卽言其家庭。亦生趣索然。於是有已逾壯年。而尙未成家者。有因結婚不易。而羣韋率同居者。影響所及。社會遲婚之弊。固日見明顯。而男女間之非禮結合。亦幾視爲無足輕重。吾人試披閱報章。無日不見有姦非案情之記載。此種傷風敗俗之事。雖不能謂完全受婚姻過難之影響。而二者之間。確有若干之聯繫。則無可否認。其有害於民族道德。當非淺鮮。蓋民族者個人之集合體也。若個人不能過健全之生活。則整個民族亦必隨之而墮落矣。</p>
<p>在今日環境之下。而言補救之道。莫若一方厲行結婚之倫德化。保持婚姻之莊嚴性。一方加重懲戎姦非罪之處罰。如果則無力結婚者。易享室家之好。而苟合之舉。亦可因而减少。今觀本市社會局所擬集團結婚辦法。對於厲行結婚倫德化。及保持婚姻莊嚴性二點。同時顧到。可謂一舉兩得者也。唯推行之道。尙有待於社會中上層階級之身體力行。爲衆先導。蔚爲風氣。不然。則仍難持諸永久也。</p>
<p>再據社會局所訂辦法。結婚日期。每年僅有四天。又參加是項婚禮者。限有定額。額滿之後。卽行拒絶。此種限制。若在人口稀少之處。自層合理。而在人烟稠密之本市。則猶有商榷餘地。蓋倫婚旣爲美德。自以普遍爲至要。我人以爲除結婚資格之審查外。應不設限制。祗須額數相當。卽可舉行婚禮。若市長與社會局長公務繁劇。不克隨時證婚。不妨由其餘各局長及社會中。之德高望重者。分任其勞。庶幾有情人能早成眷屬。不致有好事多磨之嘆也。</p>

<h3>海軍會議明年開會無望</h3>
<p>倫敦談話停頓</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日據可靠方面消息、政府官員對於明年舉行海軍會議希望甚微、此項觀察爲倫敦談話已成僵局之結果、如日本廢止華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約、則美國代表團卽將視爲談話完全終止之信號、兹悉美國尙靜候日本代表有何舉動、以免在猶有一綫希望之際卽行退出、美國代表希望日本卽能有正式舉動、以便彼等能各返鄉里、與家人團叙聖誕佳期、據華盛頓官塲最樂觀之意見、日本在條約失效之前兩年期内、能另行發起會議、或施行一種合作時期、否則一般人均以爲英美兩國將訂立協定、於造艦之、時互相通知、或用其他方法互相聯絡、此項協定、日本或者亦可加入、華盛頓官塲及全國報界雖皆表示與日本競爭造艦、以維持現有海軍比率、然彼等仍希望日本能力自克制也、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）齋藤大使與美國布列丁晚報記者之會談、因該報係美國上流新聞、故惹起全國重大之反響、惟該報所載之談話情形、完全典解所說、故該大使於十日夜聲明否認之、其說明如下、布列丁晚報記者完全將余所談誤解矣、余所談者、係英美兩國結局當諒解日本之政策、假如英美兩國無論如何决不諒解、而無理折回日本所取之進路、此時日本出於不得已、或將與之戰爭云云、此話與［假令與英美兩國非戰不可、而於遠東之計畫仍須實行、］意義完全不同、至該記者向余質問、略謂、［以英美兩國爲敵、而行使宣戰、則日本必敗、結局豈不等於國家的自殺乎、］余置答稱、結局如此亦未可知、但日本依然爲達到和平目的而努力也、日本不欲成爲帝國主義之國家、當然未抱有侵略國之思想、日本所希望者、遠東之和平與秩序耳云云、（十日日聯電）</p>

<h3>五交易所經紀人公會呈政府文</h3>
<p>請暫綏徵收交易所稅</p>
<p>麵粉·紗布·證劵·金業·雜糧·五交易所經紀人公會、呈立法院·財政部·請暫　微收交易所稅文云、近數年來、外以世界經濟恐慌之侵襲、内以水旱匪亂災害之交迫、以致農村破産、逃荒之現象日增、工商業衰沉、物財之流通益隘、中國整個經濟活動、每况愈下、前途危機、言之戰慄、夫交易所爲現代經濟組織中之統帥機關、經濟旣如是其不振、故其表示於交易所者、是爲買賣之日漸衰落若以麵粉成交數量而言、民二十尙達三萬包左右、民二十一已减退至一萬包、民二十二更不足一萬包、三年之中、竟漸减退三分之二、以金業言、其本年成交、數量祗及民十九之半數、他如證劵·紗花·雜糧·之買賣、莫不在同一現狀之下、趨於衰沉、而商人等營業、全視買賣成交額之多寡以爲定、故成交額之大量减退、亦即可以間接表示商人等營業之不振、再者、數年以來、在營業方面、雖已達山窮不盡之境、而商人等之所以猶須始終維持此不振之局面者、蓋無時不以挽救工商業之繁榮爲着想、夫交易所爲工商業市價之平凖機關、爲工商業大量需給之集中機關、爲工商業供求之調劑機關、爲工商業危險之轉嫁機關、爲工商業物質之流通機關、故若商人等徒爲一已之利益着想、而一且不維持此蕭條之局面、則即無異於對我國整個之工商業予以致命之打擊　使工商業黯淡之前途、愈趨於黑暗、且交易所停滯之結果、亦即無異於爲外人造成把持我工商業之機會、以過去之事實而言、往年在國人自辦交易所尙未興起以前、一切商品之市價、莫不以洋行及日人所辦取引所之市價爲依歸　一切騰跌漲落、都以外人之利益爲前提、而我國人反居被動地位、使中國經濟實權、全人於外人掌握之中、是以商人等鑒往策來、雖自身之利益日减、仍不甘輕易放棄此十餘年來已爭得之國人交易所、而予外人以傾覆我工商業、操縱我工商業之工具、商人等年來對於交易所買賣委託者、在可能範圍以内、皆予以相當便利、諸如佣金之减額也、買賣證金之代墊也、但須能力可及、莫不委曲求全、買賣者多得一分買賣之便利、即不啻使我國工商業多一分活動之機會、至若以公債買賣而言買賣者多得一分便利、則不僅工商業金融界能多得一分活動之機會、且於國家財政之運用、亦可以多得一分調度之便利、然而、佣金之减額、證金之墊付、對於商人等個人利益、非特爲犧牲、爲損失且爲負莫大之危險、故年來商人等營業、不特在表面上爲减退、在實際上且爲犧牲、此種事它、想我政府當局、早在洞悉之中、毋須商人等曉曉訴苦矣、最近聞財部對於交易所中買賣、欲徵收相當之交易稅、其稅率已交立法院審議中、此種交易稅之徵收、在理論上言、商人等斷未敢創言反對不過就今日之事實言、爲挽救沉悶之商况計、交易稅殊有暫緩徵收之必要、不然、徵收之稅率、務必適合我國現狀、亦應减低至於買賣者可以負担之程度、攷我國交易所之組織與夫立法、大都採自日本、兹姑引日本交易稅率以供參考、</p>
<p>日本交易所稅法（大正十一年四月改正）第五條、凡交易所内之買賣交易、得依往來差金援受而　清算者、對其買賣各約定額、依　列之稅率、課以交易稅、第一種、地方債劵或公司債劵之買賣交易、甲、屬於以七日以内之期限爲履行期之交易、萬分之○·六、乙、其他、萬分之一第二種、有價證劵之買賣交易、甲、屬於以七日以内之期限爲履行期之交易、萬分之一·五、乙、其他、萬分之二·五、第三種、商品之買賣交易、萬分之二·五、買賣解約時、其稅金亦不免除之、第七條、國債證劵之買賣交易、不課以交易稅、</p>
<p>由此日本交易稅法意而觀、可以歸納爲下列數點一·現物交易不課稅、而交易稅僅限於期貨買賣、（約期或定期）因交易所内之現貨買賣與交易所外之現貨買賣、初無二致、所外旣不課稅、所内又何獨異、期貨買賣之所以課稅者、欲使交易所市塲、趨於堅實也、二·有價證劵之定期買賣、短期稅輕、長期稅重、蓋鑒於證劵交易之本質、欲使由長期本位、誘導入於短期本位也、三·商品交易稅一律與證劵長期交易向率、蓋商品期貨市塲中之短期交易、在交易所中、並無重大之意義、故不必减輕稅率、以奬勵之、四·國債交易不課稅、蓋欲以使國債普及與流通靈活、且國債之本質上、亦無賦課有抑制投機性之高稅率之必要也、五·地方債證劵及公司債之買賣交易、其稅率較他種之交易稅爲輕蓋欲使其買賣普及與靈活也、六·交易稅乃對約定金額而課、故依反對買賣實行清算相殺時前後二約定皆課以稅、實行交割時　但課相殺交易之半數、又掉期交易、因非新交易、故不另行課稅</p>
<p>回顧我國目前情形、其經濟發達之程度、旣不及日本遠甚、交易所基礎之恐固、亦不如日本、而一切經濟之情况、尤不若日本、故今日我國若果而必須徵收交易稅、則日本現行之徵稅法、比多可以採取之處、所須注意者、以目前我國工商業之蕭條、自應暫緩徵收或力求稅率之减低、換言之、在我國今日經濟不振之時、必須以後述四點爲徵收交易稅之原則、一·國債及地方公債之買賣應免稅、二·證劵（抱括股票、公司債及其他）之定期買賣、短期稅輕、長期稅重、前者之稅率不得超過萬分之○·二五、而後者之稅率不得超過萬分之○·五、三·商品買賣不分近遠期、稅率不得超過萬分之○·五、四·商品買賣應從買賣約定額抽稅、不應從量徵稅、</p>
<p>總之、在我國經濟危機四發之今日、全國朝野、實有培養其元氣、而使其於短期中趨於恢復之必要、交易稅徵收過重、恐將釀成意外之經濟恐慌、商人等年來無時不靈其最大之努力、以爲我國工商業前途發展之一助、故敢陳其一得之見、以共參攷矣、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不　　　　　　西賓</p>
<p>在心裏十二分難過的時候，朱月英是把這張臉子，摸得脂粉很匀了。將粉撲向粉缸裏一　，對小紀道：我都照着你的話辦了，還有什麽話可說的嗎？小紀本來也想預他兩句，轉念一想，好容易把他敎訓到這種樣子，若是　話把　說翻了，他不肯到前面去，那倒是前功盡棄，這便向他笑道：你很聰明，隨便在臉上摸摸就好了。這就很行，不用就　了，我引你們去罷。胡嫂子聽着，就來拉着月英的袖子，笑着低聲道：去罷，不要緊的，有我陪着你呢。月英低了頭，就跟了他這個拉扯的勢子，手扶了墻壁，慢慢走着。胡嫂子拉着他到了院子裏的時候，他將手一摔，把手袖了回來微低了頭道：我又不是三歲兩歲的小孩子，要你扶了走幹什麽？胡嫂子回頭看他時，他可是鼓起了兩隻腮帮子的。胡嫂子站住了脚，向他道：這就是你的不對了。我們家不算，你家還有兩口子緊緊跟在後頭，都望你和他們找出飯碗來呢，你若是和人家討債的樣子走了去，那人家怎樣會高興？就是這個樣子，那事情還辦得起來嗎？不是我作舅娘的要多管你身上的閑事，誰敎你娘兒三代，千里迢迢來找我的呢，低不願幹這樣的事，我更不願幹這樣的事呢。說着，慢慢的將臉色沉了下來，接着道：你就不必去罷，你三代人遠走高飛，不要來累我這可憐的人了。（八七）▲昨日號數應改爲［八六］</p>
<h3>一羣馬路藝術家</h3>
<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>沿霞飛路走，在恩派亞之西，那邊有條横馬路，一所上海很著名的寺院，呌做國恩寺的，對面却是一座法國的天主堂，望衡對宇，宗敎不同，國籍不同，色彩不調和的兩座建築物，永遠這麽對峙着，沉默着。</p>
<p>因爲兩邊都是圍牆，所以水門汀的行人道上，被一般馬路藝術家佔據着做了地盤，一個五十多歲的男子，嘴上八字般留了兩撇鬍子，没精打采地坐在條板凳上，胸前一張板桌，放着他一應吃飯傢伙，原來是個拆字而兼代人家寫信的。時候雖早，！正午十二點鐘，！却已經有位女性的主顧，在作成他寫信的生意了，那主顧肥胖的身材，手指上套着幾個足赤的戒子，挺大的，表示出伊的富有，模樣兒像是野鷄堂子裏的老鴇，因爲伊是揚州人，而拆字先生是紹興人，兩下裏方言不同，所以每寫一句信，要往復糾纒好幾回。</p>
<p>水門汀上，寫着露天舞台四個白粉字，　栳大的圈子裏，圍着異性的一對大藝術家，男的嘴唇上掛了稀稀朗朗地一部假鬍子，鼻子週圍塗着白粉和黑墨，象徵那舞台上的小丑，額角上還套了一條矗起着的小辮子，手裏在摇着一柄破芭蕉扇，他一會兒插科打揮，一會見哼着西皮摇板，忙得皮膚上在沁出一顆顆的汗珠來，旁邊站着的女性，依舊是平常妝束，並没有化妝，不過身上衣服，油光漆賦，像似薙頭店的撇刀布般，臉上也紙錠灰色，髮　雖然不曾剪掉，可是蓬鬆得像亂柴窠般，十足顯露出伊是嗎啡海洛因的信徒，伊在按着男角的唱詞，拉一柄胡琴，輪到伊該張口的地方，也一樣會哼幾句，居然字正腔圓，崑亂不擋，站着的聽衆們，因爲是異性，所以發狂似的喊好。</p>
<p>在這條水門汀的人行道上，像這樣男女合演的露天舞台，一共是，有三四家，因爲上戲館去聽戲，起碼得化一角大洋，而在此地，却只要銅圓一枚，便可以聽一個飽，所以生涯倒也不惡。</p>
<p>還有幾個說書的，他們並没有拜過師，也不曾加入甚麽光裕社潤裕社，只爲窮途落魄，自仗濟公傳緑牲丹一類的舊小說，看的滾瓜爛熟，便老着臉在此地水門汀上說書，照樣在地上寫着某某人開講濟公傳等字樣，聽客每人取費銅元一，枚倒也取不傷廉，是别開生面的一種吃飯本領。</p>
<p>這樣馬路，因爲是這些藝術家們活動的所在，所以十分熱鬧，列位要是没有去瞻仰遇，不妨前往觀察一下，研究社會學的，在那裏更可得到不少的資料。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顔鑫泉）</p>
<p>兩個農預備耕田，希望近日下幾次大雨：一個預備曬稻做米，希望近日放幾天好太陽。處在這種情形下的天氣，當然使兩個農夫，一個喜，一個恨。做人，有時候也是如此。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我們聽了，雖然大家都知道太后是在說，尤其是最後的一句，更是絶對的和事實相反：但有那一個敢公然去反駁伊呢？這在太后自已，也早就料到没有人敢這樣大膽的。可是伊的寵奴李蓮英，却已在眉目之間，做出了一種隨時要帮太后說話的神情。他對於咸豐的事情，親眼見到的也很少，而且他明知咸豐不是一個英明的君主；不過他爲趨奉太后起見，便故意裝着是永遠和太后站在一邊的，萬一我們這些人中竟有大膽起而質難的，他誓必抺殺事實，擁護太后到底。但是抱歡得很！我們的膽子都不大，始終没有人敢說一句話，於是李蓮英的一片忠肝義膽，竟無由表現，這對於他眞是非常失望的。</p>
<p>太后發表了這一段勉强的說明之後，心中的憂鬱和悉悶，彷彿已消去了一半。想不到追樣自欺欺人的話，有時候也可以給自已得到一些安慰。伊重復再回過身去，向那寥寥的幾件遺物看了一遍，好像已覺得滿足了：便徐徐抬起頭來，透着一種很可憐的驕態，向我淺淺一笑。伊的意思似乎是說：</p>
<p>［你們别瞧他的遺物那麽少，在他生前，終究是一個皇帝！］　這樣，我們便離開了這一座正殿，轉了一個灣，走進了一座在同一宫院中的正殿；太后仍在前面領導，然而我們也都知道伊現在的目的地是一處怎樣的所在了，因此，我們更加謹愼，絶對的不說一句話。原來我們現在就要到收藏同治皇帝的遺物的所在了！（一九七）</p>
<h3>野和尙</h3>
<p>— 沈宇</p>
<p>爛旗桿橋的西首，坐落着一所給人們遺忘了的枯廟。這廟香火早熄；［住侍］亦早於若干年前不見了。因此，這業已形成爲雲遊和尙暫憇的地方。</p>
<p>入秋來，有十餘個和尙，便過宿在那所枯廟内。他們每日的生活，是二重人格的。如若不信，且聽我道來：</p>
<p>却說這許多和尙，在日間，就分散於各村莊上。他們每人的裝束，有着一種共同性的：背脊上都貼着個［韋陀］，這［韋陀］是裝在木框子内的；在框子上還挿着三炷清香：在胸前都掛着個大木魚。當他們到每家的門前，卽着地跪下，隨後就一邊舉起木槌，敲出［剥剥］的聲音，一邊嘴裏喃喃唸着經文；又一邊磕三個響頭。方移步到另一家，演着同樣的這套［巴戲］。</p>
<p>這樣的過了三四天後，就挾着［緣薄］，到曾經在那家門前唸過的家裏，聲言自已是從［杭州］或［普陀］來的；又不是說因那兒某廟［牆塌壁倒］，便是說那兒因有座橋［年久失修］，所以特來募化，以便重蓋廟字，再補橋樑。</p>
<p>老實說，鄉村的人們，都是相信［神佛］的，所以深信不疑，於是量力捐助。</p>
<p>他們募得錢回來，便在隣近鎭上，買些白酒和鮮肉。於是那所枯廟裏，頓時熱閙起來，大家吃着喝着，像着魔似的樂它一下。眞的，有時候還玩着賭的玩竟兒呢！</p>

<h3>補品雜話</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>在這旱災年頭，農村是宣告破産，都市中，也百業凋敝，滿呈蕭條氣象。熱閙的街頭，常有着空關的市房，在這不景氣的時代，白飯也將發生問題，更有什麽閒錢，來研究補品？然而閒步街巷，那種ＸＸ農塲消素牛奶的木箱，旣到處可見；豆乳和魚肝油，也銷路激增。［窮，窮，窮，還有三担銅］；何况地大物博的我國；［有健全的身體，才能幹健全的事業］，時交冬令，正有不少孱弱的人，須進稍稍補品即恢復健康呢！</p>
<p>朱　雖是個窮措大，在這米珠薪桂的環境裏，仗一枝秃筆，來維持貧賤夫婦的生活，確已是捉襟見肘，拮据萬狀！然而因着幾次患病一度咯血，孱弱的身體，因親友的相勸，和妻子的撙節，在這初冬時季，却也進服補品。這眞是可笑而又可歎的滑稽事兒！可是叨這身子孱弱的惠，居然認識了幾味味補品，不敢自秘，寫出來以供同病者採納。</p>
<p>補品中最經濟而又最有效力的，當然是荳乳冲生鷄蛋了。荳乳，荳腐店中有現成的出售，三枚銅元，已有滿滿的一碗。鷄收，每元六十個，一天吃四個，也不過銅元十枚，一月所費，合併計算，祗有大洋一元三角，然而他的滋補力，却是十分有效，這眞是平民的滋補品了。比荳乳，鷄蛋，稍微貴些的補品，却要推魚肝油呐。清魚肝油的滋補力，是很偉大的，他的價值，也十分低廉，五磅浦，應的價目，祗有一元五角，每磅代價，祗有三角左右，總不能不算是廉價的補品，不過清魚肝油的氣味，是腥臭異常的，口胃不佳的人，確是不易服飲，於是在魚油中滲加别的補品，來解除腥臭：魚肝油中加入牛乳，色作白色的，呌［乳白魚肝油［；滲加麥精，色作袍色的，呌［麥精魚肝油一］；這種魚肝油，藥房中都有現成的出售，不過價值比了清魚肝油，要貴上四五倍了。</p>
<p>牛乳也是普通的滋補品，農人們挑着分送的，價錢是十分便宜，半磅裝一瓶牛乳，每月的價目，祇有一元四角左右。不過這種牛乳，是農人們直接分送，有否滲雜荳乳，及消毒方面，是否完備，都使講究衞生的人，不敢貪圖便利，放胆進服。</p>
<p>在牛乳以外，還有牛肉汁和雞汁兩種，這兩種補品，因鷄汁的價值，每月須大洋十二元，而牛肉汁又因爲蘇州一班進補的孱弱者，諱忌戒食，消數未見暢旺。蘇州近時鷄的代價，一元可買四斤，隻鷄的代價，祇有千文左右。自已買了鷄，煮成鷄汁，代價比了現成的，要便宜一半，而且汁濃水多，鷄肉還可當做閒食，經濟方面，要合算多呢。</p>
<p>吾國的補品，眞是名月繁多，價值昻貴。那種人參，燕窩，鹿葺，龜背，不但代價昻責，更兼服法煩難，普通的還是銀耳，普通銀耳，每兩約四元左右，將乾銀耳在水中略略發胖，加入冰糖，和水在文火上鴣煮，手續旣不十分麻繁，滋味却很甜美可口。哈士蟆的滋味，也和銀耳不相上下，不過服食的當兒，先將那蟆兒的肌肉浸胖，須將附在肉上的血筯，用銀針一一别去，然後才可煮食。黄唇肚，也是參令的補品；服法，先將那巨大的魚肚，用　鐶做絲絲細條，浸胖後與米一同煨粥，略帶腥味。此外還有　邊，羊糕等等，服法大都和煮菜一般，或白煮，或紅　，各聽人們自由。一個人眞的到了藥石罔效的當兒，假使補品眞能起死回生，貧人的生命，將益發要不值錢了。俗語說得好：［飯爲滋膏肉爲膘，］那班胼乎胝足的苦力，他們的精神·比了日進補品的人們，眞要强健多多哩！</p>

<p>江蘇省立上中出品之二（自製操本）</p>
<p>（一）個人觀感</p>
<p>此次展覽之成績品、共計二萬九千七百零五件、（東四省出品、於開幕後始運到、件數未計在内、）出品種類最多者爲浙江、計三十七種、其次爲山東、計三十六種、再次爲江蘇上海青島、各有二十餘種至三十種不等、最少爲寗夏·青海·威海衛·均各不及十種、件數最多者爲福建、計三千二百一十三件、其次爲浙江、計二千六百九十四件、再次爲上海青島、各計二千四百餘件、以至二千六百餘件、最少者爲寗夏、計二十件、綜觀此次成績品之件數及種類、可略窺其勞敎及職敎發展之狀况、至少可於成績品種類之多寡、則知其對於勞敎及職敎之注意與否、優劣固另一問題也、以件數而論、亦有其例外、如廣東一省、吾人固公認其中等敎育甚爲發達也、而此次送會陳列之品、僅一百四十件、其數目未免太少、故此次陳列之出品、實際上似尙未能代表其整個之成績也、以參加展績之學校言、全國職業學校、共計二百六十六校、此次參加展績者、計一百六十九校、約佔百分之六十、全國中學共計一千八百九十三校、此次參加展績者、計三百三十七校、約佔百分之十八、全國師範學校共計八百六十七校、此次參加展績者計一百三十九校、約佔百分之十六之全國小學、共計二十五萬八千零六十四校、此次參加展覽者、計八百六十八校、約佔百分之○○三○四○、於此更可見此次成績品、僅能代表大體上之成績、此殆因事實上之困難不得不如此耳、</p>
<p>成績品以學校分、屬於中學師範及小學者多、屬於職業學校者外、此乃就全部成績品而言、以各省市分别而論、有小學成績品多於中學師範及職業學校者、如上海南京是、有職業學校成績品多於中小學者、如湖南是、有中學成績品多於職業學校及小學者、如廣東是、以成績品之性質言、工科最多、家事次之、農科最少、中國爲農業國家、而農業成績、竟如是之少、誠堪浩歏、如米麥絲茶、爲我國農産出品之大宗、而茶葉一項、此次全塲竟未一見、殊爲遺憾、以成績品之類别言、乎工業多於機械工業、裝飾品多於實用品、手工業在今日固有提倡改良之必要、而大規模之生産當有賴於機械工業、裝飾品固爲人生所需要、但非屬於必要、吾人於此不能不加以注意也至展覽品之最受贊美者、如湖南之剌繡、福建之漆器、江西之瓷器、江蘇之玻璃陶器、山東之石類雕刻上海浙江河南等省市之軍用模型、上海南京福建等省市之各種設計模型、河北福建等省之敎學用具、中華職業學校之機械木工出品、河北工學院附設職業學校及湖南高級工業學校之應化及染織作品、平市韓氏女子職業補習學校之紡綫機等、或以特産見稱、或以創造著名、或以實用見勝、或以精緻擅長、實令人深入印象之優良作品也、</p>
<p>此次展覽品、琳瑯滿目美不勝收、各種作品、除少數陳舊者外、大部分均屬新製、此殆參觀者所公認、王部長在全國職業學校及中小學勞作科成績品展覽會一覽上所題之勞展旨趣、其希望展覽品所合之條件第一次即爲［能代表平時一般成績、而非臨時特别製作之品、］但就吾人觀感所及、能合於此項條件者、固屬甚多、而臨時特别製作之品恐難保證其必無、所謂代表平時一般成績者、即指平時敎學時學生之勞作成績而言如目的只在展覽而臨時加工趕造、殊失去敎育之意義與勞作之本意、</p>
<p>勞展此次所顯示者、爲出品之成績、而非全部勞作敎育之成績、謂爲勞作品之展覧則可、謂爲整但的勞作敎育成績展覽則未見其可、蓋勞作敎育成績、非盡可以出品顯示之也、如小學課程標凖中校事作業之敎室清潔·佈置·管理·裝飾·校舍校地敎具之分工管理設計裝飾修理、家事作業之物件調查、衣飾之洗摺農事作業之農民生活調查以及工藝作業之工人生活調查等、只能以文字或報告顯示之、而無如木工竹工之具體作品、又如中學課程標凖中關於農業之播種·移植·耕地·除草·施肥·防害·收穫·家事中之家庭看護兒童養育等、均無具體之實物以表現其成績、且亦不能一一送列於會塲、故此次展覽、爲勞作品之展覽、而非整個勞作敎育成績之展覽、吾人參觀之後、亦僅可謂某校勞作品如何、某省勞作品如何、若據此以精密的評衡其整個之勞作敎育成績、殆非事理之所許也、</p>
<p>此次參加展覧之學校、爲職業學校中學師範學校及小學、完全屬於普通敎育範圍、而决未涉及高等敎育、據個人感想、所謂職業敎育及勞作敎育、非僅限於普通敎育之一階段、應使整個的學校系統勞作化·生産化·勞動主義敎育家勃郎斯基有言曰、［工業敎育爲最高的勞作敎育］、吾人細味其言、可知職業敎育非僅限於職業學校、勞作敎育非僅限於中小學、專科以上學校之農工科、亦可包括於職業敎育及勞作敎育之範圍内、年來中央之限制文法科及提倡實科、其目的即在造成實用人才、以應國家社會之需要、所謂實科敎育、即高級之職業敎育與高級之勞作敎育、如將專科以上學校之實科出品、陳列於一堂、使參觀者對於各級學校之生産作業護一整個之槪念與比較、當較此次之展覧、更有意義、更有價值、</p>
<p>（二）今後希望</p>
<p>此次勞展機器産品及農業産品之少、已略述如上、各地固有之手工業、自須設法加以改良、而機器生産在今日更屬刻不容缓、蓋乎工業所需成本大而産量緩、機器生産則反是、值此洋貨湧進入超有增無已之今日、尤須作大規模之機器生産、始足以資挽救、農業生産、攸關國本、年來各級政府提倡不遺餘力、社會人士、亦莫不以此爲復興農村之要圖、而此次勞展所陳列之農業産品乃竟寥寥可數、即此、少數之展覽品、亦未見有若何特殊進步、今後之工科職業學校、應由手工業進而注意於機器工業、尤須於機器生産改良各地固有之特産、農業職業學校應注意農業技術及産品之改進、尤須利用科學方法改良各地原有之土産、以爲復興農村之基礎、</p>
<p>過去職業學校敎援方法、大多徒憑書本講授、或因經濟關係、無充分設備、設工科者無完備之工廠、辦農科者缺乏廣大之農塲、以致學生只有腦的訓練而缺乏手的訓練、甚至有相當之設備、而實行操作又假手於工人、其流弊與缺乏實習塲所者同、今後之職業學校必須力求充實設備、使學生乎的訓練多於腦的訓練、至少手腦訓練之時間應相等、實習方法、必須如工廠之工人、農塲之農人、一切勞苦工作、躬自動手、不得假手於他人、如此、學生所獲得之知識與經騐、方不致流於空虛、</p>
<p>勞作敎育、爲新近之産物、其意義較昔日之手工及工藝爲廣泛、昔日之手工及工藝不能抱括今日勞作致育、而今日之勞作敎育則可包括昔日之手工或工藝、勞作敎育範圍况較廣泛、則其實施之方法、亦自較困難、勞作敎育之目標、應以培養兒童創作能力爲首要、並須於勞動作業中表現其自由意志、學校應有充分之勞作設備、如工廠農塲以及家事實習塲所等等、使兒童自已選擇工作、自已計畫、自已創造、不必拘於一定之方式、舉凡學校生活環境中之有勞動作業者、均可利用以實施勞作敎育、如僅賴數小時之勞作敎學、恐課程標凖中所規定之目標、未見即可完全達到、故勞作敎學、應與各科相連貫、以各種生産勞動之實習、以養成兒童勞動之身手、確立勞作敎育之眞諦、</p>

<p>西青籃球希望又弱</p>
<h3>江灣敗於曁南</h3>
<p>三五比二八差七分</p>
<p>曁南以射籃較準勝</p>
<p>曁南江灣昨晚之西青籃球戰、在江灣言、實含有極重大之意義、蓋江灣球藝、殊見猛進、且在本屆中、尙未曾一敗、頗有染指西青錦標之希望、曁南球技、亦見進步、但已爲西青所挫、果而江灣跳過此關、則將與西青麥令相抗、向鼎原中、但昨晚劇戰之結果、江灣竟爲旣南所敗、比數三十五比二十八分、從此江灣在西青中之希望、又見黯淡、此則不免使昨晚數百復旦啦啦隊、大感失望而掃興也、</p>
<p>▲球藝高下　在球藝言、兩隊實相伯仲、聯絡之純熟、曁南不如江灣、但江灣卒遭挫折者、動作太慢、致予敵人以退守機會、觀乎在上半時中、江灣屢屢進逼、終不易進入籃下者、亦此故也、以射籃之凖確言、曁南勝於江灣、曁南之能得勝、亦在於此、如曁南能在聯絡及進攻戰法、加以攻研、實爲有希望之球隊、而昨晚王南珍之後衞、尤爲個中翹楚、</p>
<p>▲局勢緊張　局面之緊張、則一時無兩、曁南先以三分佔先、江灣在艱困之局面下平等之、雙方攻守、但極嚴密小心、得分甚難、八比八後、江灣連得三分、漸漸以十五比十佔優、一時呼聲大起、但曁南諸子、毫不示弱、上半時戰成各十五之平手、下半時江灣改以慢戰法進攻、曁南遂乘此大舉進取、突以二十三比十八超出、從此江灣屈居人下、不得抬頭、二十八比二十、三十一比二十二、最後之結果、爲三十五比二十八▲曁南　擲罰　犯分　▲江灣　擲罰犯分</p>

<h3>華東勝國立商學院</h3>
<p>▲結果四十九對十三</p>
<p>國立商學院女子籃球隊、爲獨立學院錦標隊、昨遇華東隊於華東球塲、裁判員夏開明、開賽時、華東前鋒頗爲活躍、張素梅竟連中三元估絶對優勢商學院不得不暫停、互商戰略、四果然漸見起色、張美雲一擲中的、但華東後衛防守嚴密、致商院無隙可乘、而華東前鋒聯絡純熟、張素梅一再得分、第一節結果十九對五、華東佔前、第二節商學院鑒於第一節失分累累、全隊健兒、奮起力抗、故華東前鋒亦無多大進展、各得四分、上半時結果東以念三對九勝、再戰聲起、華東挾戰勝餘威、沈嫣法葆箴等投遞敏捷、鋒芒更露、連連告中、而商學院雖竭力防禦、但力不從心、以二對八結束第三節、第四節華東因勝劵可操、大調生力軍應戰、商學院乘機而起、但因求勝心切、投擲反難命中、仍以二對十八敗北、總結果四十九對十三、華東大勝、</p>

<h3>文學中的思想</h3>
<p>— 沈渡</p>
<p>文學的要素中，思想是其一。</p>
<p>［没有思想的内容，藝術的作品是不得有的。連那作家只尊重形式，關於内容並不願慮到的作品，也終於表現着某種一定的思想。］</p>
<p>這句話的意思就是說没有思想，藝術品就不成爲藝術品。因爲思想，是作者的一種人生觀，無論人生觀的露骨或隱約，但那人生觀一定能顯現在他的作品之中。這緣於人生觀不外乎是作者其人的人格或其人的個性之故。以作者所站的社會的地位必然地能在其作品裏反映出他的思想來，在有意無意之中。有人警告着：［你不能爲了想把某一種恩想具體化，或爲想宣傳某一種思想而創作，或者以某一種恩想爲標準而鑑賞當面的作品！］這個警告的意思是好的，不過在實際上則没有多大的意義，因爲你雖欲避免爲什麽思想而創作，然而，你的社會會敎你没有抵抗地去替它作反映，你的思想已經被决定於你的社會的存在了。我們應當了解：［詩人和一般人一樣，連其思想感情都是社會的産物。］自然一個文藝家也是同樣。最要緊的，不是在想把某一種思想具體化，或爲宣傳某一種思想的創作會失去了它的藝術的價值，而是在於這作品中所表現的眞實性的程度。愈是與客觀的現實相近，則藝術的評價愈高，所以在這種意味上，巴爾扎克雖有意的是有産社會熱烈的擁護者，但是他仍不失爲一個偉大的藝術家，就是因爲他的創作十足地表現了當時的客觀的現實的緣故。同樣。我們也不非難托爾斯泰，他雖是一個基督敎思想的作家，然而在他表現了社會的現實這一點上，是值得加以敬愛的。</p>
<p>不過，［作者在描寫思想的時候，須反思想溶入在感情的坩鍋裏面來描寫。］確是一句至言，因爲藝術家是以形象來表現自已底思想的，倘若作者不藉形象而藉理理論的證明來寫，就不成其爲藝術品了。</p>
<h3>母女（上）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>天，是她的房子，大地是她的床，世界是她的家。</p>
<p>女兒只有四歲，却在媽媽的懷中，跟着走了不少地方，跟着嘗了不少辛苦，跟着認識了這個惡濁的世面。</p>
<p>母女兩個，是一對流浪人，從東流到西，從北方流到南方。</p>
<p>天晚了，也許太陽並没有落到西方地平綫上，但，都市巍高的建築確實掩滅了它的光波，同時，街兩旁閃亮的電燈，在抖動起它們的眼睛。</p>
<p>總之，一天的時光，算是又過去了。流浪的人，原是不須費精神計算時日的，過一天算一天，過十二個月，就添一歲。流浪人的精神，只是用在怎樣不使肚子餓，或是，怎樣能使肚子的餓多挨過一些時間。</p>
<p>但是，隨着天晚，她的肚子裏確在活動着了，先還可以免强支持，和肚中的空虛抗拒着，可是過一會工夫就全然不行了，她單只覺得身上鬆得很，手裏没有氣力，至於兩條腿，挪動起來，頂少也能有千斤重。</p>
<p>這，也還是可以忍受的，她是一個大人，她知道自已是窮困的，自已是個連匹野狗都不如的東西。可是，孩子的食欲，一經湧上來，那是非要有些東西應付一下不可。</p>
<p>其實，孩子已經呌她好一會工夫了，還是那樣噥喞着：</p>
<p>［媽，我要吃，我，我肚子餓呀，肚子熱］。</p>
<p>餓有什麽辦法，媽媽也不是有錢的人。</p>
<p>抱着孩子，胡巷口旁僻靜地方坐下了。</p>
<p>這只大床，床身是凉的。流浪的她，不由就想起來丨秋天到了。夏天，地面上不是火一般熱麽。</p>
<p>她只想坐下身子，制住自已肚子的絞動，還想用這動作移轉孩子的要求。多笨的舉動！孩子的餓，不是用一個動作可以遮飾過去的。孩子又在噥唧着；</p>
<p>［媽，我要吃，我，我肚子餓呀，肚子熱呀］。</p>
<p>這回，不開口給以答覆，看來是不行的，她又把平常的老話說了出來：</p>
<p>［小春，媽的好孩子，一會就去討，稍微歇一會好麽］。</p>
<p>話是平和的，然後，按照舊習慣，在孩子骯髒的小臉上，狠狠地吻了幾口。</p>
<p>可是，想到這孩子本身又是多麽不祥的一個生物啊。她在這熱烈的接吻之接，看見孩子肖似她爹的眼睛上就想到她的爹。</p>
<p>孩子的爹是一個好爹，只是他没有作侈的命運。眞是碰巧的事情，當孩子生到人世時候，正是他離開人世的一刻。所以我們要說他没有作爹的命運，倒不如說孩子是不吉祥的。</p>
<p>因此，對於眼前的孩子，立時又引起少許憎惡。</p>
<p>這個爹死的眞奋怪，在江裏打魚，大晴天，忽然就興起風雲，等雨點降下時，他的漁船跟着翻進水裏去。一生還不完的債，那些債就如他打漁的網，網絲硬反他拖進江水裏。</p>
<p>但他死，還是没有死完了債務，家裏所有的爛東西，都歸了債主，而她，就緊跟着離開那冷落的家門。於是，娘兒倆就變成流浪人，變成了四海爲家的人。</p>
<p>一倜賣大餅油條的半老太太，用籃子提了一籃，從遠處慢慢走來，喊賣的聲音，短促異常，其實可以說是她不願開放他的喉嚨，這正如一個家室温飽的半老太太不願邁動他的兩條腿一般樣子。</p>
<p>［媽賣大餅油條的來啦］。</p>
<p>孩子即興喊起，揚着手，眼晴都要飛到天上去了。媽的心裏抓了急，這一來，她可怎樣掩飾她欺騙孩子的事跡呢。一個餓肚子的孩子，她絶對不願輕易放棄了她眼前的食物。正在她思索時，孩子急得第二次又嚷着；</p>
<p>［媽，賣大餅油條的來啦］。</p>
<p>［媽知道］。</p>
<p>笑着，手伸進破衣服的袋子裏，摸得清清楚楚還有六個銅板，六個銅板，比别人六塊錢都寳貴呀；說了多少好話，呌了多少聲大爺，把腦袋往水門汀地上磕了多少頭，這一天才要來的六個銅板，不是銅板，簡直是黄金，不是血汗！眞的要把這六個銅板化了去？不行，化去也塡不飽肚子，一個蒼蠅吞進老虎肚子裏，哪能救得飢！</p>
<p>老太太已經聽到孩子第二次喴媽說的話，她就走到前面來，她不因爲娘兒兩個的身位而遠去，因爲事實上她的主顧多是些衣服襤褸，充其量也都是過不去十個銅板交易的人。</p>
<p>電燈光愈發顯得亮，就是四處越加黑的時候。現在，是黑了。</p>
<h3>不兇狗</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>三年來</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>三年來，我總是在這條走不盡飄流綫上踱着，踱着，踱過碧緣的海，踱過飢織的農村，踱過黑暗的地獄。整整的三年寳貴的日子，都在飄流中浪費了！於今我總是依稀地嘆惜着！生活會把一個年青人變老，同樣，流浪也會把一個年青人變老，三年來，我不知經過了多少的波折與挣扎，飢餓的痛苦，寂寞的痛苦，疾病的痛苦，愛情的痛苦，失眼的痛苦，···我全部都體騐過。人們的回憶我不曉得，我自已的回憶是痛苦多而歡樂少，人說我老了，是的，我也這樣覺得。</p>
<p>我說，這年頭是流浪的年頭，也是飢餓的年頭，多少的人們從飢餓的農村流出來，又有多少的人們從肥瘦不均的大都市裏流出去，但是，流來流去仍是空着肚子帶着失望與憤恨的心情，正如我一樣，我足足流了三年了，還不是帶着這個失望的心，有時覺得一天的日子都很難挨過，但是，這三年長長的歲月又好像在瞬息中溜過去了。</p>
<p>這三年中我的生活的變幻，想起來有時連我自已都不敢相信。我曾經在一個没有太陽的世界上生活了幾個月，吃着冷飯，睡着地板，聽着病人的呻吟，看着獄卒猙獰的笑臉，在夜裏每個人都在訴說着他們悲苦的命運。我也曾在灰色的羣衆中掛過斜皮帶，打過仗，看見過無數的死人，腐屍，與紫血，一只鐵鳥屙下了一堆屎就毁減了幾十個人的生命，我也看見過，我並不是一個硬心腸的人，但是那時看見一個或數個死人正像看見幾只青蛙死在田畔上那樣的感覺。後來我又在桃色的愛祉的翼下躱了一些時候，但不久我又决心跳出來，我覺得青年人有這份生活也不壞，但是長躱是不行的，所以我又疏遠了牠，重新踏上了旅途。其他如疾病，飢餓，寂寞，失眼，等等的痛苦的滋味，我都深深地經騐過，可是，這情進境，是不能在這篇短文裏詳述出來的。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>直到最近，我這流浪的生活好像告了一個小小的段落，而很偶然地走到别一個國度裏來求學。一個人的生活實在變幻莫測，有時眞有點像夢那麽地，連自已也預料不到，我這一次東來就是這樣。說是幸運嗎？不，那是不能這樣說的，也許未來更有悲慘的境遇在等候着我，未來的事誰又曉得呢？不過在目前，想起了幾年來挣扎的血痕，而今天有機會重温這種學生生活，當我每天抱着書包走過那條狹長的栽滿着紅葉的小道上到學校上課時總是威到無限的愉快！</p>
<p>一九三四十二月於東京。</p>
<h3>從河口到老街</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>從火車裏拽着行李走出來，帶着一夜不得安眠的疲倦，怯生生的踏上河口的境土時，我們有些茫然了，！</p>
<p>河口原來就是這樣丫嗎？這末衰老而帶着幾分頽唐氣的一個小市鎭呀，人口很少，較熱　的街道只有一條，街旁有着幾顆龐大茂盛的緑樹，在炎熱的烈日下，走在這街上，是那末怪陰凉的；只是一股難聞的烟瘴氣味，時時向人襲來，好像是那樹的花的氣息，又好像是厠所裏的糞臭似的，這氣味眞使我們一嗅着就有些害怕！</p>
<p>隨着店子裏的吆司，走到河�督辦檢察處，先將出境護照檢騐完畢，檢察官又像學校裏的老師，口試學生似的，問了我們一些籍貫及出省去做什麽的話，然後帶着傲慢的語氣說：</p>
<p>［好，旣是這樣，也不留難你們。不然，凡到河口的旅客都要在河口躭擱一天，俟慢慢的檢察完後，第二天才能到老街去的！你們是特别通容啦］</p>
<p>他說着，把狡詰的眼光望着我們，彷彿想得到我們的什麽報酬。然而我們只臉上浮出一個感激的微笑，收檢起了東西，便怱怱促促的走開了。</p>
<p>河口的天氣，不想竟是這樣熱；我們在街上走了一趟，累得滿身大汗，汗衣濕淋淋的貼在背脊上，怪難過的。那股難聞的烟瘴氣味，又時時襲來，使我們不敢再停留，懷着一顆警喜的心，踏上了異國的四丈多長的鐵橋，對雲南一貼也没有留戀的，走到耀着帝國主義威風的老街去了。</p>
<p>老街，這蹲在富良江旁，虎視耽耽的在望着河口的市鎭，人口不見得比河口多，街道也只有那樣一條，在這裏除了開商店的多是我們貴國的廣東人而外，還有許多擺賭攤的。</p>
<p>賭的塲所，多至十餘處，黑越越的一裠人，日夜不息的圍在街頭賭着。因爲天氣熱的緣故，還在賭塲上掛着一床代替電風扇的草蓆，用一個人專在那裏扯動着，發出一陣陣爽人的凉風。</p>
<p>賭塲的旁邊，是不用代價就可以站着看着的戲噻。做戲的都是裝得怪模怪樣，不知在唱着什麽的安南人。他們那演戲的舉動，滑稽得眞是令人好笑！</p>
<p>這娱樂完全是爲賭錢的人而設的。賭錢的人一天低着頭，沉迷在賭錢的事上，那裏有心抬起頭來看看？所以做戲的完全就像小孩子在鬧着玩似的，隨便演奏着就算了。</p>
<p>才把脚步踏到這異國的境土上時，一個雄糾糾的安南兵，站在橋的盡頭，投給我們一個陌生的眼光，使我們不禁有幾分恐懼。我們知道這裏是檢察得十分厲害的。聽說，不獨帶了鴉片的，檢察着要拿去坐水牢去！即使帶着火柴的，也要受到極嚴厲的處罰的。這種種的傳聞，在平日已使我們有些害怕，今日踏到了這異國的國土，心不禁卜卜的跳起來了。</p>
<p>跨過橋不遠，在街的正對面，有着一間小小的西式房子，房裏坐着一位法官似的法國人，那態度的尊嚴，使人不敢抬起頭來正眼看一看。吆司把我�引到了這裏，受了一次嚴密的檢察，（幸好我們没有帶着什麽犯禁的東西，謝謝上帝！）又把護照查騐過後，才得安然回到店子裏去。</p>
<p>天氣眞是熱，一天喝着水，也是那麽怪渴的。到了晚上，天氣有點凉了，三個年青人披着衣裳，跑到被夜色籠罩着的那座鐵橋上去，浴在凉爽的江風裏，聽着那怒喊着，替安南人在鳴不平的當良江的江聲，於是心是有些感到這異國的悲哀了。</p>
<h3>明天（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— （Josephcornad）吳向隅譯</p>
<p>［喴，爸爸，讓我進去。我是哈利，我是眞的！回家來只有一［天很短的時間。］</p>
<p>樓上幾個窗當中的一個揭開。</p>
<p>［一件頑笑吧了，報信的傢伙，］在上面黑暗中老海格特的聲音說。［你和他毫無關係。這將把什麽事都弄糟了。］</p>
<p>她聽到哈利海格波特說，［哈羅，爸爸，］隨後［打璫］一響。窗門乒乓一聲放下了，他又站到她的面前。</p>
<p>［道仍和從前一樣。從前禁止我跑開，幾乎把我鞭死，現在我回來，他又把一把鍫胡亂地想摔在我頭上禁止我進去。那把鍫擦傷我的肩胛。］</p>
<p>她打了一個寒慓。</p>
<p>［我並不在乎，］你開始說，［不過我把我的一先零買了車票，最後兩辦士化在修面上！爲了尊敬道老頭子的原故。］</p>
<p>［你眞是哈利，海格波特麽？］她很快地問，［你能證明是麽？］</p>
<p>［我能證明是麽，還有别人能證明是麽？］他愉快地說。</p>
<p>［用什麽來證明呢？我要證明做什麽呢？除開英國以外，也許在世界没有一處地方，那兒你能找到一個男子，或者尤其一個女人，他們能够記起我是哈利海格波特。我也許比任何生存的人中像哈利海格波特；我能在一分鐘内證明一切，如果你能讓我走進你的門去。］</p>
<p>［進來，］她說。</p>
<p>他於是走進嘉維爾家的前面園地。他的高大的影子，昂然跨向前來，她背向着窗等待，注視着那人景，在那人影面，只有一起落的足步看起來是最實質的部分。光綫射在闊邊的帽子上；一個强有力的肩胛出現，看起來似乎把黑暗劃開一樣；一隻脚跨向前面。他旋轉了一下，然後立定，面向着在她背後有反光的會客室的窗，頭向左右轉動，自已輕柔的笑笑。</p>

<h3>金鷄反小半元餘</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉微漲五磅音、上日收盤形勢良好、然塲中新買者未旺、各月略漲二三角、拍至二三盤、愈開愈軟、因有一部份逢漲時賣出、致塲中籌碼充足、結果各月又跌三四五六角、午後開盤市况仍平澹、但現紗成交仍有三千包以外、然市塲丰人心未能激起、各月又跌一二四角、查賣出吉豐五百五十包、大豐九百包、錦昌四百包、明華六百五十包、賡豐一千六百五十包、長豐一千七百包、仁豐六百五十包、同和六百五十包、買進生源五百包、穗隆一千○五十包、愼昌二千四百包、大福五百包、同和四百五十包、信誠四百包、通記四百五十包、源大七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>棉花隨金價下跌</h3>
<p>棉市愈弱、因美棉雖漲五磅音、但金價趨跌、美匯放長、致人心軟化、據某棉業機關消息、西北一路存花充足、多數尙未運出、以後來源當有擁到之望、但通成公司及通州帮吸收之額、安然不放云、</p>

<h3>麩皮存底不厚</h3>

<h3>人情世故</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>什麽呌做［人情世故］？［人情世故］原是一種［處世藝術］。但是我輩欲研究［處世藝術］，非先把［人情世故］精密地研究一下不可。什麽呌做［人情？］就是人類共通的性情脾氣。什麽呌做［世故？］就是社會不斷地表演着各種變幻離奇的狀態。</p>
<p>人情是［趨吉避凶］的，我們對於吉的事情，當趨之若騖，對於凶的事情，就高飛遠行，這就可以［逢凶化吉］。人情是［怕硬欺軟］的，對於硬性的朋友，切不可去惹他，免得［老虎頭上拍蒼蠅］，對於軟性的朋友，舞弄舞弄他們，也未始不可，横豎他們無力反抗的，這就呌做［乖人不吃眼前虧］。人情是［畏難樂易］的，故對於容易幹的事情，大家努力去幹，對於不容易幹的事情，大家就袖手傍觀，隔岸觀火，這就遇不到［碰頂子］的事體了。</p>
<p>這樣人情的證例，原是很多，兹不過略舉數端以爲則例。有［人情］而後把這種人情在社會裏一幕一幕地表演出來，這就呌做［世故］。故深曉得［人情世故］的變態，則［做人之道，思過半矣］。但是單單知道，還不濟事，更須以［恕道行之］。假定我心裏認爲這件事情是凶的，硬性的，不容易幹的，非但自已不肯幹，便也勸人不必去幹。假定我心裏認爲這件事　是吉的，軟性的，是容易幹的，我先來幹，也請大家來。</p>
<p>所以要研究［處世的藝術］，非先熟識［人情世故］不可。因爲熟識了［人情世故］，方知各種［趨］［避］之法，［迎］［拒］之方。但是人情世故，過於熟識，勢必處處［先意承旨］，事事［仰人鼻息］，完全失去自動自主的能力，只有客觀主張，一點没有主觀的存在，人生完全是機械作用。若不熟識［人情世故］，說話做事，往往到處碰壁，所謂［少不更事］所謂［不識相］，所謂［看不出風頭］，非但事體幹不成，還要受人家一派譏誚，痛駡。這種人就呌做［戇大］。</p>
<p>這樣說來，熟識［人情世故］不好，不熟識［人情世故］又不好，呌我們怎樣做人呢？古人有個［做人之道］的比喻很好，說，做人像銅錢，所謂銅錢，是從</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>前的制錢，不是現在的銅板。因爲從前的制錢，廓是圓的，孔是方的，故做人也如制錢一樣，要［外圓而内方］。因此我想到從前的做人，是像制錢，現在的做人，是像銅板，因爲只有圓的，而没有方的，故廢制錢而用銅板，其中大有諷世的意義吧？又有人說，做人像［賭博］從前的做人是鬭［六十四］，劃一不二的。現在的做人像鬭［撲克］，專門［偷機］。偷得着便勝利，偷不着便失敗，這個比方到也很有道理。這兩椿事體，雖然很小，然也很可以看出現在的［人情世故］。</p>
<p>但是做人到底不能全靠［愉機］的，也不能一味［圓滑］的。做人當備具三個最要條件，第一是明辨是非，第二是認識眞理，第三要曉得時代的趨勢。倘做人能懂得這三個條件，［人情世故］，知道也好，不知道也好。因爲中國人格的墮落，志氣的銷沉，多是［人情世故］太熟的緣故。</p>
<h3>夫妻之間</h3>
<p>— 啟昌</p>
<p>這是一個初冬的夜晚，風呼呼地號着，他奔跑了一天，碰了幾次的釘了，錢没有找到手，房子也租不成，他心裏明知如果這樣子回去，他的妻一定會吵鬧起來的，但是，爲了肚子餓，同時也是不願妻久等；他不得不拖着沉重的脚步，從北四川路轉回法租界的公寓去。</p>
<p>公寓裏靜悄悄地，在那暗淡的燈光下，只有一個值差的茶房，蹲在那角落裏，等着客人的使喚，一切盡都是死寂着，他帶着一顆羞愧的心，茫然地走進這破舊的公寓，踏進那比亭子間還要小一半的房子，妻已經躺在床上睡了。雖然知道他進來，却一聲不響地翻一翻眼，就裝着睡了。難道她眞的生氣了麽？他疑惑着，但是，他不能不開口：</p>
<p>［蘭！不舒服麽？吃過了飯没有］？</p>
<p>得不到回音，於是他裝着笑臉，坐到床沿去，一面撫摩着她的頭髮，一面繼續地問道：</p>
<p>［蘭！不舒服麽？吃過了飯没有］？</p>
<p>［什麽呌做舒　服不舒服？自從嫁了你以後，有那一天使我舒服過？這一次回上海來，滿想和你有個舒服的日子過誰知竟弄得連一個家都没有，住到這樣髒的公寓來，受着這樣的苦！］她說着，强硬的語調，慢慢地軟化起來，終於哭了。</p>
<p>［蘭！别再傷心囉，這樣一個小波折，算得什麽呢？明後天我們就可以把家安頓下來，好好地把生活整頓一下，相信我吧，一切，一切我們都是有辦法的啊！］</p>
<p>［有什麽辦法？這一年來我的苦也受够了！可是你那一天不是說一切都有辦法的？老實說：我也不是一個小孩子，你這些話只好騙騙你自已罷了！］</p>
<p>［我何曾存心騙你呢？你要知道在這樣的社會裏頭，要找一個飯碗並不是容易的事啊！不過，我們的一切事，過兩天就有辦法的。你放心好了。蘭！别再這樣孩子氣了，一切事，我們慢慢地來商量計劃吧！······你吃過了飯没有］？</p>
<p>［誰還想吃飯？現在是什麽時候了？不提起還好，一提起，我就恨不得把你殺了！物質上的痛苦，說是因爲你失業，經濟困難，我總算忍受過去了。然而，那精神上的苦痛，我是受不了的；你自已想一想：像今天　　，從早晨一直到這個時候，一個人困在這破舊的小房子裏，唉！那是多麽地難過呵！從前聽人家說最苦的莫如坐牢，可是，今天我要說，人生最痛夺的莫過於今天的我······］她像受了什麽大的寃屈似地抽咽起來。</p>
<p>他本來在外邊奔走了一天，碰了幾個釘子，蓄着滿肚子的悶氣，在找地方發洩，可是，一看見了妻的悲痛，同時又想到了他們的幸福與前途，使他不得不把這一曰悶氣壓下去。他原是一個對於生活非常隨便的人，因此，他自從去年失了業以後，這一年來所受的盡是一些災難，使他感到在這人間能够同情他，和他共患難的，就祇有他的妻子，所以，他對於妻子的痛苦的發怒，也就深深地付以同情。他極力地在忘掉了這現實的蓋痛，而追求着未來的幸福；這未乘的幸福，就好像跑狗出裏面的電兎一樣，在他的前面逗引着。因此，雖然到了筋疲力盡的時候，他還是緊緊地追上去，趕着未來的光明。這樣，也就給了他多少的慰安。他想着，他原諒了妻子的吵鬧，他耐心地勸慰她：</p>
<p>［别再吵鬧了，蘭！明天我們把家安頓下來，一切就全都有辦法了。快點起來吃飯吧，時間不早了。］</p>
<p>他不得不在妻子的面前，裝着快樂，呌了兩客飯和妻一道吃了。</p>

<h3>做人的藝術</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在這個年頭兒，一切都難，尤其是做人，做人的難處，第一個問題便是吃飯，本來在現在處處在鬧着吃飯恐慌的當兒，吃飯眞是一件不很容易的事情；那末不吃飯，如何可以做人？這眞令人有［爲人容易做人難］之嘆了！</p>
<p>吃飯難，做人自然更難了；要是做得兇些，便要遭人毒手，假使做得善了，那又搶不到飯碗，如果不善不兇，那也許人家又會說你是個半刁子。所以我說：現在的做人實在是難極了；硬旣不能，軟又不可，强權野蠻無効，屈服讓步更是不行，呵！難矣哉，今日之爲人也！</p>
<p>從前是英雄造時世，現代是時世造英雄，爲了不容易做人的緣故，却使一般懂得做人藝術，善使登龍方法的專家，於是捷足先登，大摇大擺，儼然是一代偉人，那些不諳於此道門檻者，祇好［徒看他人雲路通］而已。</p>
<p>其實做人也並不是一椿怎樣困難的事，祇有我輩笨伯，生來是個寒酸命，所以才這船如此，不然父母旣生我，天賦的五官四肢亦皆完備，一個人形早已像了，做人的條件旣具，又何患不能成功呢？這當然是缺乏［做人］的修養的研究；因此雖已具了做人的形，而尙未能有做人的質。［猢猻戴帽子］，自已看看像煞有介事，得意忘形的認爲自已果然成了個人了，可是在别人看來，依舊還是一隻毛臉尖嘴的怪物。</p>
<p>當然，我是明白做人要懂得做人的藝術；但是像瞎子聽講般的縱使聽懂了，而却不會使用，或許使用得不得其道，那還不是一樣的白費了一番瞎心計麽？雖然誰都知道，趨炎附勢，和脅肩諂笑是最好不過的做人登龍妙術，就是我對於此道也曾下過一番死工夫。當時的確滿想［十年窗下無人問，一舉成名天下知］的，可是事實與理想適得其反，到如今非但此法行不通，並且窮小子到處都碰壁，碰得一鼻子灰。</p>
<p>我爲了想做一個現代的完人，所以最近三年以來，對於做人的藝術，不遺餘力的潛心研究；現在我自已雖没有成功，却想來造就一般聰明的讀者，有意者不妨來照法運用一下，百試百騐，反正我是抱着大無畏的犧牲精神的，不過只好筆記，而没有講義。課程録下：</p>
<p>拍馬術，吹牛法，老面皮的養成，鑽營的實習，人格多元論，忍耐心的訓練，撬後門的秘訣。苟能盡學此至上藝術，我相信不獨能做人得意，到處受人歡迎，擁戴，而且一生吃穿無愁，甚至還可以升官發財，隨你要想什麽事都易如反掌，欲［挾一技而走天下］者，捨此莫屬。</p>
<p>凡有意來者，敬贈［假面具］一具，［做人藝術槪論］一部，價值連城，所備無多，蓋速，蓋速。</p>
<h3>瑪麗</h3>
<p>— 應將</p>
<p>好不奇怪？爲了扮演過一天［街頭人］，那一些人都呌我做［瑪麗］，這不祇劇社裏面的人這樣呌我，就連那些不相熟的大學生也是如此；他們有時還跟在我的背後問：［你的約翰那裏去了？］來調侃我，眞是難爲情得很！但，時　過久了，也就覺得很自然，而這［瑪麗］兩個字，也就自然面然地代替了我的名字，好吧，現在［瑪麗］就算我的名字，可是一橡［街頭人］那樣的悲劇，我可受</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>不了。記得有一天，因爲坐在家裏無聊，我冒着大雪跑到劇社去玩，一踏進門，便有一股熱氣冲上心來，因爲那房間裏面是充滿着勃勃的生氣的。一羣年靑的戲劇藝術的愛好者丨小鬍子導演，太監的化裝先生，傻瓜的總務老爺，做媽媽的後臺老板，和我的漂亮的約翰，圍着火爐，那廢高談闊論的，看見我進門，約翰便毫無忌撣地呌了起來：［呵！瑪麗，外邊多冷啊！你跑出來幹嗎呢！］我脫下了大衣，坐到火爐旁邊去後，才用［街頭人］的臺辭回答他：［是的，外邊的確很冷·但是，有什麽法子想呢？你知道，我是趕着戲院子散塲的時候出來的，我一直跑到巴黎大戲院的門口，冒着雪，懇求那些從戲院子裏面出來的紳士，小姐，太太，施拾給我一兩個弗蘭，養活我的瑪麗。可是，我東懇西求地跟着他們的車子跑，讓那泥土濺了我的衣服，結果他們所給我的回答，並不是我所希望着的弗蘭，却是一頓無理的臭駡！他媽的！終有一天······］我剛唸到這裏，化裝太監便怪腔怪調地挿進嘴來：［終有一天，終有一天你打算怎樣呢？］死不要臉的約翰搶着答道：］終有一天，我和瑪麗養個小寳寳出來，］惹得他們全都笑了，却把我氣得要死。我說［約翰！你如果是這樣缺德，我可再也不理你了！］約翰忙着對我賠不是，說好話；這小子眞討壓，常常弄得人心癢癢的···眞實這小的翰的怪有趣的可愛呢！我這樣想着，兩頰也就燒得紅起來了。但是，一轉臉來看見那方臉的傻瓜總務，我的心一冷，剛才的羞意已換上一番厭恨了。他老是那麽釘着眼·像餓狼似的。尤其想到他往日的追求我的醜態，眞是呌人討厭極了，後臺老板媽媽眞像媽媽問家常事那樣的問這個，問那個；計劃着劇社進行的工作。小鬍子導演却始終是像敎師一樣惇惇的敎導我，老實說，我在舞臺上能有這樣的成功，也是因爲有他。所以，我敬畏他，我有時還呌他［爸爸］呢。化裝先生，雖說是個太監，却是個色迷，像小丑那樣的。到底還是約翰有點可愛。但是，我不願意做［街頭人］裏面的瑪麗。我始終是這樣想着。</p>
<h3>男性的心</h3>
<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>我不合你來往交際了。</p>
<p>你給了我一種誘惑，使我漸漸地將要失去男性的自尊心而甘拜下風，這我是不幹的。</p>
<p>去年夏天，我合你在ＸＸ路那小房子裏頭做朋友以後，我已經由觀察與調查得來的結果，明瞭你是一個意識没落，環境不良，伶仃孤苦而擺小姐架子的女人；而且知道你已經到了經濟売全瀕於絶境，却在我的跟前欺騙我說有存欵多少，要在社會上做一番事業，那一種墮落的交際花的手腕，給我一個覺得可笑又可憐的印象了。而且你已經由幻滅而消沉，以至於將墮入普通女人的享樂的漩渦中去，却在我的跟前裝做還是一個什麽前途的女子，思想怎麽的了不起，更加使我在心裏對你的輕視。在那時候，我旣然明瞭你的一切，我自然并不受你的花言與肉體的誘惑。</p>
<p>可是同時我實在可憐你，很願意帮助你在社會事業上做一番工作，因此我勸誘你走上文學之路，替你修改文章，敎你研究書籍，也就費了多多少少的精神，希望你有所造就。我的觀念是以爲，一個曾經努力過革命事業的女子，她的思想觀念是受過訓練的，她總能够覺悟過來，將自已從將要隨落的深淵的岸邊回頭努力；而且又是一個愛好文藝的女子，總可以一心一德地將自已獻身給文藝運動，安定了野馬奔放的心靈，興奮了向上前進的感情，而成爲一個耐勞吃苦孜孜向學的文藝學徒，以達到在文藝上成功之路。</p>
<p>可是，你都使我失望！</p>
<p>你對於文學并没有信心。你不專心地研究學習，寫寫文章是那樣的潦草馬虎，一點都不精心救其達到眞善美的成功，只是高興的時候就亂寫一陣，寫完了就算了，而且連着第二遍再修改也不，完全是一種有閒小阻對於筆墨的游戲，并不是一個文藝學徒在學習寫作文藝作品的嚴肅態度。你雖然曾經在報紙雜誌上發表過幾篇作品，可是那並非要得的東西，而你却認爲滿足了，並不想努力去創作出成功的作品。而且，近來還連寫作都不努力了。一個作家的成功，並不是那樣容易的，而你太看輕了作家的成名，將人家的努力不算那麽一回事。如今的中國文壇固然是烏烟瘴氣，海派文人輩出，醜態到處展覽，可是，可以崇敬的作家，在努力向上的作家，并不是没有；你不能够因爲海派文人的可鄙，而輕視了整個中國文壇；你尤其不能够因爲海派文人成名的快，而輕視了文藝作品的創作。</p>
<p>然而，你是輕視了整個文壇，因此更輕視了文藝作品的創作，你給我一個失望了。</p>
<p>假如我是一個女性崇拜者，自然，你老早就抓住了我的心去了；可是，你并没有用心了解我，以爲我正和普通的男子一樣，你對於我亦要失望了。</p>
<p>男性的心，是比較你們女性來得有理智的，有自尊的，他如果覺得可以用理智去和情感戰鬥，而且是已經將情感戰勝了以後，那他是走上理智之路，一點不回頭。</p>
<p>你要知道，男性的心是：事業重於愛情的。</p>
<p>别了，朋友！當你發見你所追求的人已經失踪以後，最好是應該用你的聰明的腦筋，研究其所以追求失敗的原因，那對於你才是有益的。否則，你將墮落到不可收拾了。</p>
<p>我最後告訴你一句話：你對於男性所用的手腕，其實並不高明，那是多麽虛僞的而且是多麽愚笨的呵！</p>

<h3>Central Executive Committee Report Also Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT) Central Executive Committee (CEC) opened its first meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th. Present were 50 members of the CEC, 13 members of the Central Supervisory Committee (CSC), 38 alternate CEC members, and 11 alternate CSC members, totaling 112 people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was absent due to other engagements, so Wang Jingwei presided over the meeting. (A) Matters Reported: First, the Secretary-General reported on the number of attendees and the minutes of the preparatory meeting, as well as the list of review committee members for each group's proposals as decided by the Presidium. Then, Standing Committee member Ju Zheng read the Central Standing Committee's report (original text in a separate telegram), which was resolved to be submitted to the Party Affairs Group for review. (B) Matters for Discussion: Only the draft Constitution of the Republic of China was discussed. First, the secretary of the meeting hall read the full text of the draft Constitution, article by article. The committee members then successively expressed their opinions, generally believing that the draft Constitution, in accordance with Articles 21 and 22 of Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction, was still in the stage of formulation and public dissemination before it could be discussed by the National Assembly. At this stage, it was still a draft in nature. Whether at the Plenary Session or the Representative Assembly, the draft could only be carefully reviewed and could not be finalized. At the same time, during this stage, the work undertaken by the Party included gathering opinions from all parties and vigorously publicizing the Constitution so that the public would have a deep understanding of it. All committee members unanimously agreed with this proposal, and it was resolved to submit the draft to Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, He Yingqin, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Song Ziwen, Shao Yuanchong, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Chen Zhaoying, Qin Zhen, Wang Faqin, Chen Gongbo, Jing Hengyi, Gan Naiguang, Shi Ying, Kong Xiangxi, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Zhiben, Wu Jingheng, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Shao Lizi, Chen Shuren, Jiao Yitang, Cheng Tianfang, Ke Xinge, Liang Hancao, Luo Jialun, Tang Youren, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Bulei, Ma Chaojun, Li Renren, Zhan Jusi, Deng Qingyang, Chen Bijun, Yang Jie, Zhu Peide, and Tang Shengzhi, among others, for review, totaling 46 people. Lin Sen would convene the meeting, which was scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 11th. Legislators of the Legislative Yuan Fu Bingchang, Wu Jingxiong, Lin Bin, Tao Lüqian, He Sui, Wu Shangying, and Ma Yinchu were invited to attend the review meeting for consultation. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>

It was decided to propose several important principles to the Plenary Session for discussion and decision. After the Plenary Session made a decision, the Central Standing Committee would form a Draft Constitution Review Committee for a detailed review. All committee members unanimously agreed. It was resolved to submit this report to the Plenary Session. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM. A second plenary session will be held on the 12th to discuss the matter.

<h3>Central Standing Committee Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee report from the matters reported in the first meeting of the Fifth Plenary Session of the KMT CEC on the morning of the 11th has been resolved by the Plenary Session to be submitted to the Party Affairs Group for review. The original text is recorded as follows: "Since the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session on January 25th of this year, ten months have passed. During this period, although the situation has generally stabilized, the international situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and the country's situation is becoming more precarious. Domestically, the rural economy is declining, and the people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, compounded by natural disasters and banditry, leading to social unrest. The Standing Committee, mindful of the heavy responsibility entrusted by the Plenary Session, carefully weighed the priorities and determined the urgent tasks. It regarded the suppression of the Red bandits as the foundation for stabilizing the country and the construction of production as the means to strengthen national power. Other measures, such as the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, were also proposed in the context of a difficult financial environment to allow the people to recuperate and strengthen the foundation of the nation. With these principles established, we have been diligently engaged in our work and have achieved some results. Now, at the beginning of the Fifth Plenary Session, we respectfully present a summary of our work below. In the previous Plenary Session, the guiding principle of saving the nation and ensuring its survival was the need to concentrate and strengthen national power. This is the guiding principle that this committee has adhered to and dared not neglect. Therefore, within the Party, we have strived for unity. For those who have slightly different opinions, we have done our best to resolve them, aiming for consistent advocacy, active solidarity, and joint resistance against foreign aggression. As for strengthening national power, the prerequisite is stability and order. The urgent problem of the Red bandits has persisted for several years, and their forceful suppression is necessary. However, the bandit areas are vast, spanning several provinces, with the old nests in Jiangxi and Fujian particularly deeply rooted. Therefore, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek carefully planned and comprehensively led the troops, using the strategy of blockhouses and highways to achieve a steady and solid effect. The officers and soldiers obeyed orders, were loyal and brave, and were increasingly effective in their efforts. Until recently, the old nests in Jiangxi and Fujian were quickly cleared. Although remnants are fleeing and still need to be intercepted, the arrangements are thorough, and suppression can be expected. Since the previous Plenary Session decided to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the Ministry of Finance has carefully formulated plans, separately supervising the implementation of the provinces. The number of localities that have separately implemented this is increasing daily, and the people across the country can gradually reduce their burden and slightly alleviate their difficulties. The work of removing obstacles has been effective, and active production and construction can be promoted to advance rapidly. In terms of politics, although financial difficulties have hindered the progress of large-scale production and construction, we have planned and proceeded to the best of our ability, and are gradually implementing them. For example, the rapid progress of highway construction in various provinces, as well as the expedited construction and renovation of railways, have achieved visible results. The establishment of various state-run industries has also been gradually realized. As for the development of water conservancy and the restoration of rural areas, some have already been steadily progressing, while others are being planned for implementation. Given time, it will not be difficult to achieve success. As for Party affairs, all measures are based on concentrating power and maximizing practical effectiveness. Regarding the organization of Party departments at all levels, we have not only worked to economize and eliminate redundant personnel, but also strived to ensure that the work of Party departments can be effective and serve society. As for areas that have been reorganized for a long time with little effect, we have dispatched central personnel to provide specialized guidance in order to unify wills and eliminate disputes. Therefore, the organization of Party departments in various regions is more orderly, and internal disputes have been reduced. In the future, by proceeding step by step, we should be able to make daily progress. Secondly, the Fifth National Congress of the Party, originally scheduled for November 12th of this year, was approaching. In October of this year, as the suppression of bandits approached victory and awaited the culmination of efforts, all Central Committee members responsible for the suppression of bandits, as well as a majority of army and Party department representatives, were unable to leave their posts due to their location on the front lines. They sent telegrams requesting a postponement. The Committee, after assessing the situation, believed that the suppression of bandits had reached a final stage, and any relaxation would undo the previous efforts. Therefore, it cited the precedent of the postponement of the Third National Congress due to the Northern Expedition, and resolved to postpone the Fifth National Congress. The date would be determined by this Congress. The above is a summary of Party and government work since October. Other parts will be reported in detail separately.

According to Fu Bingchang, during his recent trip to the south, he had met with Mr. Hu and the leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi several times, and exchanged opinions on the current situation in detail.

<p>(Peiping) The Yuguan sub-branch of our national customs, because it was ordered to prohibit the export of silver, is implementing suppression of silver being transported from various places within the pass to outside the pass when it exceeds 50 yuan.

A certain party even interfered arbitrarily. The two sides are now in contention. Recently, the Yuguan pseudo-customs sub-branch abused its power and interfered with the freedom of travelers. Recently, there was a sailboat arriving at Yuguan from Qingdao, Shandong. The cargo it was carrying was forcibly confiscated by the pseudo-customs. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>An Eleven-Nation Committee is Formed to Draft a Convention on Punishing Atrocities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council today unanimously passed a compromise proposal to resolve the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary. After private talks between Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtic, British Lord Privy Seal Eden, Italian representative Aloisi, and French Foreign Minister Laval, it was agreed to accept this proposal. It is expected that this agreement will calm the tension between Yugoslavia and Hungary. (10th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Central European crisis triggered by Yugoslavia's complaint against Hungary regarding the Marseille assassination is gradually subsiding. Hungary accepted the resolution on this matter at today's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, which stipulates: (1) A general condemnation of terrorism; (2) Hungary should thoroughly investigate the negligence of certain officials and punish them; (3) The League of Nations Administrative Council should establish a committee to consider all issues related to terrorist acts, especially the right to asylum and abuse of political fugitives. (Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council tonight unanimously passed a resolution ending the debate on Yugoslavia's application. The resolution first expressed respect for the late Yugoslav King Alexander and the late French Foreign Minister Barthou, who were assassinated in Marseille, and then stated that no country should encourage or tolerate the activities of terrorist factions within its borders for political purposes. Prevention should be taken before terrorist acts occur, and punishment should be imposed afterward without any neglect. Assistance should be provided to other countries upon request, as this is the duty of any country. The Administrative Council, based on the documents submitted by Yugoslavia, felt that various issues related to the existence and activities of terrorist elements outside Yugoslavia had not been properly resolved to the satisfaction of the Yugoslav government, and that some Hungarian officials, at least due to negligence, were responsible for the preparation of the Marseille assassination. The Council believes that the Hungarian government is aware of its international responsibilities, which are to take or promote various measures to sanction officials whose crimes have been confirmed, and believes that the Hungarian government is willing to fulfill this responsibility. It specifically requests that the measures to be taken in the future be notified to the Council at any time. Finally, the Administrative Council resolved to establish a committee of experts to study the issue of drafting an international convention to punish political terrorism and crimes. This committee will be composed of representatives from eleven countries: Belgium, Britain, Chile, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union, and will submit a report to the Administrative Council.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has restored its slightly damaged reputation due to the good results achieved in handling the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia and the Saar police affairs. The Administrative Council has extended the meeting to January 10th and will continue to meet during the Saar plebiscite. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry today expressed satisfaction with the League of Nations' resolution on the Hungarian-Yugoslav dispute. Newspapers in the Yugoslav capital celebrated the resolution, while newspapers in the Hungarian capital also expressed gratitude and praised the resourcefulness of British Lord Privy Seal Eden.

<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister's Words Shocked the Audience</h3>
<p>Chairman Said the League of Nations is Capable</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Administrative Council reopened its meeting this afternoon, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu spoke out sharply against Hungary, saying that they had never felt such a loss before the death of Count Albert Apponyi, the former Hungarian representative to the League of Nations. The Count always based his arguments on the beginning of the discussion, while Hungarian critics today are unnecessarily accused of provocation. He resided in Britain and Switzerland for a long time. May I ask whether the history of the two countries allows fugitives to carry weapons and practice with weapons, bullets, and explosives? The Romanian Foreign Minister also told the Hungarians that the honor of the country should be considered in this matter. The council members appeared uneasy when they heard the words of the Romanian Foreign Minister. Italian representative Aloisi stared at the ceiling, French Foreign Minister Laval picked his teeth, and British Lord Privy Seal Eden frequently looked at his fingernails. The Romanian Foreign Minister continued that even if the Hungarian government did not have contact with the Croatian fugitives, it was difficult to absolve itself of negligence in terms of its responsibility. As for the revision of the treaty, it should be known that today, the general public believes that maintaining the status quo is sufficient to appease. Those who are dissatisfied with the current borders account for only a very small number in various countries. The Romanian Foreign Minister finally said that Hungary is the most active and enthusiastic center of the movement to revise the treaty.</p>
<p>According to Croatian Foreign Minister Dr. Pinitis, who took the floor after him, his tone was milder than that of Titulescu. He only opposed the movement to revise the peace treaty and pleaded with the League of Nations Administrative Council to find a way to satisfy Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtich declared that Hungary's memorandum in response to Yugoslavia's complaint was entirely denied, and that there was no evidence to support the claim that it was a political tactic of the Little Entente. The South Slavic fugitives established an agency in Hungary for two years, and the Hungarian government only admitted to knowing about it and needed seven months to clean up the agency. Its lack of credibility can be seen from this. The South Slavic government has been complaining to the Hungarian government about terrorist parties for more than five years, but the Hungarian government has only dealt with one case, but the terrorists involved in the case are still at large and escaped before being arrested.</p>
<p>Hungarian representative to the Minority Committee, Eckhardt, stated that the issue of fugitives is gradually deteriorating. The Yugoslav government promised to stop expelling Hungarian expatriates, but has not yet complied.</p>
<p>After the Administrative Council meeting, the representatives held a closed meeting to discuss the wording of the draft resolution. The draft resolution has been telegraphed to its home government by the Hungarian representative and will be formally submitted at tonight's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting.</p>
<p>The compromise reached included blaming the Marseille assassination and stating that no country can ignore any plan to prevent such crimes from being repeated. The debate heard by the League of Nations Administrative Council, and the documents received, all showed that some Hungarian officials were negligent in their duties regarding matters related to the conspiracy that led to the Marseille assassination. The League of Nations Administrative Council hopes that the Hungarian government will fulfill its international obligations and report to the League of Nations Administrative Council with appropriate punishments imposed on weak officials. The League of Nations Administrative Council believes that international law is insufficient to guarantee effective international cooperation regarding the rules for suppressing the activities of terrorist parties, so it decided to establish a committee of experts to study the issue in order to draft an international convention on this matter.</p>
<p>The chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council declared at the end of today's debate that the League of Nations has proved its ability to handle affairs.</p>
<p>The general public was initially afraid that the Hungarian government would disagree with the issue of the responsibility of some Hungarian officials mentioned in the draft resolution, but it was heard that the Hungarian government had accepted the draft resolution and was very satisfied.

<h3>Establishment of the Compromise</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations had a long consultation today regarding the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary, among which French Foreign Minister Laval, British representative Eden, and Italian representative Aloisi made the most efforts. It started in the early morning and ended in the afternoon, and a new mediation plan was established. On the one hand, it appeases Yugoslavia's anger, and on the other hand, it does not hurt Hungary's feelings too much. This plan stipulates that (1) a formal and empty crime statement should be announced for the Marseille tragedy, and an international court should be organized to specialize in hearing terrorist acts; (2) the territorial integrity of the League of Nations member states must not be illegally and wantonly invaded, and this point should be recorded in the League of Nations minutes; (3) according to the evidence obtained, Hungary does have negligence in suppressing Croatian terrorist organizations, and the Hungarian government should promptly investigate the responsible officials. At first, various countries thought that the wording of the above draft resolution was flexible and hoped that both South Korea and Hungary would agree. Unexpectedly, when seeking the consent of South Korea and Hungary, both sides insisted on their own opinions and refused to show weakness. Hungary was unwilling to be openly criticized for neglecting suppression, while South Rasfus insisted that the strict punishment of the parties concerned was indispensable. After the mediation of the three major political figures of Britain, France and Italy, the compromise was reached. When the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvened this afternoon, Romanian Director Titulescu again raised severe questions to Hungary. Romania's support for Yugoslavia was expected, but the severity of Titulescu's wording was unexpected. Titulescu continued to mention the issue of amending the treaty, saying that according to Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, any amendment to the current treaty must be unanimously passed by all members of the League of Nations, including the countries concerned, so that the amendment of the treaty is legal, and all advocacy of amending the treaty is illegal, because it actually violates the League of Nations Covenant, and the League of Nations Covenant is aimed at protecting the territorial integrity of all countries.

<p>(Geneva) France today submitted a memorandum on the conclusion of an international convention stipulating the right of asylum and suppressing abuse to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The memorandum involves terrorism of a political nature, such as attempts to assassinate heads of state, government leaders, public officials, and private individuals with different political views, and opposes sabotage and terrorist groups and propaganda. The memorandum stipulates that any case that violates the international convention may request the International Court of Justice in The Hague to try it, and that any condemned person may only be pardoned by the League of Nations Administrative Council. League of Nations member states should provide extradition facilities for political assassins. The League of Nations Administrative Council seems to be going to appoint a small committee to consider the international convention proposed by France. (10th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Great Victory for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Hungarian government has finalized and accepted the draft resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council on the Marseille case, and the dispute between South Korea and Hungary has ended from now on. This is a great victory for the League of Nations. At 6:05 this evening, when Czech Foreign Minister Benes gave a speech in the Administrative Council and the interpreter translated it, British Secretary of State Eden, French Foreign Minister Laval, Italian representative Aloisi, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Ganya gathered in another room. The representatives of Britain, France, and Italy made their final efforts to make Hungary agree to the draft resolution that had already been drafted. The hope of a compromise has become even stronger since then. At 11:15 in the evening, the Administrative Council reconvened. Chairman Vasconcelos of Portugal, expressed his respect for the late Yugoslav King Alexander and the late French Foreign Minister Barthou. However, because the Hungarian government's reply had not yet arrived, the meeting was adjourned for a quarter of an hour. After the reply arrived, expressing its support for the draft resolution, the Administrative Council reconvened and unanimously passed the resolution. French Foreign Minister Laval declared after the vote, [The League of Nations is helpful to peace. This can be proved again. The content of the resolution coincides with our psychology, and the League of Nations deeply mourns the national mourning of Yugoslavia, which is also expressed in the resolution. This case explains various principles, proves various facts, and makes judgments. Whether the situation can be eased in the future and meet the wishes of the general public depends only on the Hungarian government. As for the League of Nations Administrative Council, its high mission has been accomplished, which is what we should declare. (10th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Administrative Council adjourned last night, French Foreign Minister Laval praised the wise attitude of Hungary and South Korea in approving the resolution, and said that the League of Nations once again lived up to its noble mission and made great contributions to maintaining peace. Following Laval's speech, Italian representative Aloisi and Administrative Council Chairman Vasconcelos of Portugal thanked British representative Eden and then announced the adjournment. The Administrative Council will discuss the Saar issue at today's meeting, and after that, this extraordinary meeting will end. (10th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Passes a Resolution on the Saar Police Issue</h3>
<p>British to be Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council today unanimously passed a resolution authorizing Knox, chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, to convene an international police force to maintain order during the vote next month. The police force is allocated as follows: (1) 1,500 British; (2) 1,300 Italians; (3) 250 each from the Netherlands and Sweden. All are under the command of British officers, and the candidates have not yet been announced.

<p>(London) According to Foreign Minister Simon's statement in the House of Commons today, the international police force sent to the Saar to maintain order during the plebiscite will be commanded by British officers, and the team should be able to serve in the Saar before Christmas.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter in Geneva, the Netherlands and Sweden have accepted the League of Nations' request and agreed to send teams to join the international police force. Knox, chairman of the Saar Administrative Commission, is British, so the number of people sent by the United Kingdom will be particularly large. The total number of the police force is 4,000.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the Dutch government will send 200 marines to the Saar on December 12. (10th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: The international troops sent by the League of Nations to maintain order will arrive here on the 22nd of this month. The Saar Administration Commission has recently started the resettlement work. According to the number of troops, there are about 3,500 people in total. The Saar mining agency's houses can accommodate 2,600 people, and the remaining 900 people should be provided with dormitories by residents, otherwise they must be requisitioned from the private sector. The authorities have considered it. In addition, the International Army enjoys extraterritoriality, and what kind of court should accept disputes between soldiers and residents? The Administrative Committee is now preparing regulations to regulate it. (11th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: Saar people living in various places have now set off from all over to prepare to vote to decide their affiliation.

<h3>Britain Replies to the United States on Delinquent War Debts</h3>
<p>(Washington) Britain and France have now decided not to pay the US debt due on the 15th of this month. Britain has today sent a note to the US State Department stating that it is unable to pay. The French cabinet has met to discuss this matter. Although former Prime Minister Herriot still advocated paying, the majority favored postponement. The amount owed by Britain is US$117,670,765. It is also found that when the previous war debt expired, namely June 15, only Finland paid the US debt among the debtor countries. (10th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The US government notified the debt groups a few days ago to collect the war debt due on the 15th of this month. Britain has now prepared a reply, and its content will be reported to the House of Commons by Finance Minister Chamberlain tomorrow. The general idea of the reply is that Britain's position on the war debt issue has been decided earlier and is known to the US government. There are no new facts at present that can change Britain's decision. (10th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Launches National Anti-Drug Movement</h3>

<h3>Italian-Abyssinian Military Conflict, Abyssinia Requests Arbitration</h3>
<p>Italian Semi-Official Denial of Troops Crossing the Border</p>
<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian Embassy in France issued a communique stating that according to the Abyssinian government's investigation, the attackers who attacked the Abyssinian army escorting the British-Abyssinian border delimitation committee on the 5th of this month were indeed Italian troops, and they carried artillery, tanks, and aircraft. The Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy has been ordered to request that the matter be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Italian-Abyssinian Treaty. (10th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: The semi-official side here strongly denies the rumors that Italian troops crossed the border into Abyssinia, causing a conflict. They claim that it was actually Abyssinian troops carrying multiple machine guns and one field gun who attacked the Italian territory of Somalia. It was only after reinforcements arrived that the Abyssinian army was repelled. As for the rumor that the British joined in, it is even more impossible because the British-Abyssinian Border Commission passed through Aural twelve days ago. (11th Day National Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>No Intention to Devalue the Yuan Price at Present</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Associated Press investigated public and private opinions, it learned that the government has no intention of devaluing the US dollar again at present, but there are at least two situations in which President Roosevelt may approve the devaluation of the US dollar: (1) If European gold standard countries such as France abandon the gold standard, the US dollar can also take the opportunity to devalue at the same time as the world's currencies; (2) If the time is right, President Luo will not hesitate to continue to devalue the US dollar in order to stabilize international currencies. According to the Associated Press, the government is determined to oppose inflation. Officials claim that the $3,000,000,000 in paper money passed by the last Congress has not yet been issued, but the government approves of debt inflation. (10th Day National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Group Marriages in the New Life</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the increasingly extravagant social customs and the expenditure on weddings often amounting to thousands, has specially drafted measures for group weddings to promote thrift and reverse the declining trend. The various points proposed are well-intentioned and commendable, truly a good deed to change customs and habits.</p>
<p>Marriage is a major event in life, and also a necessary procedure to maintain the family system and stabilize social life. However, if it is too difficult, it will easily lead to an increase in the number of unmarried men and women. If it is too easy, it will lead to frequent separations of couples and shake the foundation of the family. Both excess and deficiency can become factors that contribute to social evils and endanger the prosperity of the nation. Today, extravagance is prevalent, especially in large cities where ostentation is valued. The cost of weddings often exceeds thousands. The lower and middle classes often incur debts for marriage in order to maintain appearances. Speaking of individuals, they suffer for life; speaking of families, they become dull and lifeless. As a result, some are still unmarried even in their prime, and some live together without marriage because marriage is not easy. As a result, the problem of late marriage in society is becoming increasingly apparent, and illicit relationships between men and women are almost regarded as insignificant. If we browse through newspapers, we see records of adultery cases every day. Although such scandalous events cannot be said to be entirely affected by the difficulty of marriage, there is indeed some connection between the two, which cannot be denied. Its harm to national morality is not insignificant. A nation is a collection of individuals. If individuals cannot lead a healthy life, the entire nation will inevitably decline.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, the best way to remedy this is to vigorously promote the ethics of marriage on the one hand, maintaining the solemnity of marriage, and on the other hand, increasing the punishment for adultery. If so, those who are unable to marry easily can enjoy the happiness of family life, and illicit relationships can be reduced accordingly. Now, the group marriage measures proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau simultaneously address both the promotion of marriage ethics and the maintenance of the solemnity of marriage, which can be said to be a win-win situation. However, the way to promote it still depends on the upper and middle classes of society taking the lead and setting an example, creating a trend. Otherwise, it will still be difficult to sustain it permanently.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the measures formulated by the Social Bureau, the wedding dates are only four days a year, and the number of participants in this wedding is limited. After the quota is full, they will be rejected. This kind of restriction is naturally reasonable in places with sparse population, but in this city with dense population, there is still room for discussion. Since ethical marriage is a virtue, universality is of the utmost importance. We believe that, in addition to the review of marriage qualifications, there should be no restrictions. As long as the number is appropriate, the wedding can be held. If the mayor and the director of the Social Bureau are too busy with official duties to officiate the wedding at any time, other bureau directors and respected members of society may share the burden, so that lovers can get married sooner and not sigh at the many obstacles to good things.</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Hosts Banquet for Inspection Group</p>
<h3>Sino-British Goodwill Speeches Published</h3>
<p>British Government and Public Pay Attention to China's Situation</p>
<p>Our Two Inspection Groups Receive Preferential Treatment in Britain</p>
<p>(London) Ambassador Guo Taiqi hosted a banquet in his residence today for Yu Pengfei, Xu Tingyao, and Mao Bangchu, and invited British Air Minister Londonderry, Army Minister Hailsham, Transport Minister Piri, Chairman of the China Association Benard, and others to attend. Ambassador Guo gave a speech on the spot to express his gratitude to the British cabinet members for their presence and the friendly assistance given to the two Chinese inspection groups. The two inspection groups conducted inspections in the UK more thoroughly than in any other country, which proves China's friendship and trust in the UK, and the UK is also eager to reciprocate. The recent speeches in the British newspapers and Parliament can prove that the British government and the public are now closely watching the current situation in China and understanding it more and more. He is gratified by this. Twelve years ago, British and American politicians cooperated in Washington, making the treaty have the power of understanding that a strong and unified China is the best guarantee for peace and prosperity in the Far East. At a time when the whole world needs a fair market more than ever before, the Chinese government is actively implementing construction plans and expanding its governance within the country. What China and the world need most now is a reaffirmation of the two major principles enshrined in the Nine-Power Treaty: the inviolability of China's territorial integrity and equal opportunities for all countries to trade in China. It is time for British and American politicians to take the lead in sponsoring the principles established in Washington in 1922, etc.</p>
<p>British Army Minister Hailsham delivered a very friendly and sympathetic reply after Ambassador Guo's speech, but did not involve the diplomatic events mentioned by Ambassador Guo. The Army Minister said that he admired the work of the Chinese government and was honored to meet with members of the two Chinese inspection groups. He hoped that they would get everything they wanted. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>China Recovers Pilotage Rights</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Expected to Compromise</p>
<p>Japan Opposes Alone</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese government has recently been actively carrying out the movement to recover pilotage rights and has started negotiations with various countries including Britain, Japan, France, and Italy. Britain and the United States intend to compromise with China on the condition of protecting the livelihoods of their own pilots. However, Japan fears that China's recovery of pilotage rights from extraterritorial rights is not only a major issue in foreign policy, but also that its vested interests in national defense may be infringed upon. It strongly opposes it. The Ministry of Communications is scheduled to convene representatives of various shipping companies and people related to pilotage rights on the Yangtze River to solicit opinions and consider countermeasures.

<h3>Joint Military Exercise in Singapore</h3>
<p>Unprecedented in Scope</p>
<p>Naval Base Used for the First Time</p>
<p>Singapore: The British naval and land forces here are scheduled to begin joint military exercises on Thursday, which are quite extensive in nature and unprecedented here. There are currently 18 destroyers and 2 other warships here. Since the announcement of the military exercise, all sectors have paid close attention to this matter, because not only the naval, land, and air forces will participate, but the volunteer army will also participate in this exercise. The navy is responsible for the offensive, and various strategic locations in Singapore, including the naval base, will be the target of the navy's attack. The defenders are the regular army, air force, and volunteer army. The situation of the military exercise is not secret at all, and the general methods have long been known to everyone. However, both the attacking and defending sides naturally do not want to announce their detailed strategies. After the military exercise is completed, a press release will be issued at the front to announce everything. There are two points that people here are most concerned about: 1. This is the first opportunity to test the defense engineering of the naval base; 2. The Singapore volunteer army is an army that has not experienced war, and will now jointly resist the enemy with the regular army. (Reuters, 11th) Singapore: The Singapore naval base was used for the first time today by 16 destroyers. The ships will participate in the joint military exercise of the land, sea, and air forces that will begin on Thursday. It is learned that everything about this exercise will be kept strictly confidential. The rumor that it will be made public is not true. From October 13th to 16th, this port will be closed from a certain time to a certain time. The ships will not turn on their lights during night exercises. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Unlikely to Be Held Next Year</h3>
<p>London Talks Stalled</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, government officials have very little hope for holding a naval conference next year. This observation is the result of the London talks becoming deadlocked. If Japan abolishes the Washington and London Naval Treaties, the US delegation will regard it as a sign that the talks have completely ended. It is learned that the United States is still waiting for the Japanese representatives to take any action to avoid withdrawing when there is still a glimmer of hope. The US representatives hope that Japan can take formal action so that they can all return home and reunite with their families for the Christmas holidays. According to the most optimistic opinions in Washington officialdom, Japan can initiate another conference or implement a period of cooperation within the two-year period before the treaty expires. Otherwise, people generally believe that the United Kingdom and the United States will conclude an agreement to notify each other when building ships or to contact each other in other ways. Japan may also join this agreement. Although Washington officialdom and the national media have expressed their intention to compete with Japan in shipbuilding to maintain the existing naval ratio, they still hope that Japan can exercise self-restraint. (National Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The naval preparatory talks have made no progress and have come to a standstill. The US representatives are even waiting for Japan to abandon the Washington Treaty. The United Kingdom is also waiting for Japan to announce the holding of Anglo-Japanese talks. Therefore, everyone's attention is focused on the attitude of the Japanese representatives. Representative Yamamoto is now considering the best countermeasures to prepare for starting negotiations with the UK. (Japan United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council</h3>
<p>Passes the Draft to Abolish the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Palace Conference to Be Held Again on the 19th</p>

It has been confirmed that the government's original plan will be unanimously approved by the whole meeting. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Saito Declares Japan Does Not Fear Fighting Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Then Corrects His Words</p>
<p>Philadelphia: Japanese Ambassador Saito gave a speech here today, reiterating that Japan's main fleet cannot be lower than that of the United States. After the speech, Saito made a statement to the evening newspaper, saying that Japan will take the policies it deems necessary for the sake of establishing peace in the Far East. The intentions of Britain and the United States are not a concern. Even if it has to fight with the two countries, it will not hesitate. If Japan believes it is necessary to maintain peace in the Far East, it will also annex northern China, regardless of what other countries say or do. If the United States believes that Japan will become an imperialist country and wants to stop it, it should send a fleet to the Far East. But Japan is not an imperialist, and its intention is only to strictly maintain the existing treaties, especially the treaties on the open door in China, etc. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Ambassador Saito's meeting with a reporter from the American Bretton Evening News has caused a major reaction across the country because the newspaper is an upper-class newspaper in the United States. However, the interview as reported in the paper completely misinterpreted what was said, so the ambassador issued a statement on the night of the 10th denying it. The explanation is as follows: The reporter from the Bretton Evening News completely misunderstood what I said. What I said was that the United Kingdom and the United States will eventually understand Japan's policy. If the United Kingdom and the United States never understand no matter what, and unreasonably turn back the path taken by Japan, then Japan will have no choice but to go to war with them, etc. This is completely different from [even if it is unavoidable to fight with the United Kingdom and the United States, the plan in the Far East must still be implemented]. When the reporter asked me, he said, [If you go to war with the United Kingdom and the United States, Japan will definitely be defeated. Wouldn't the end result be national suicide?] I replied that the end result may be like this, but Japan is still working hard to achieve peace. Japan does not want to become an imperialist country, and of course does not have the idea of invading other countries. What Japan hopes for is peace and order in the Far East, etc. (Japan United Press, 10th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Ota is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Hirota today to report on the recent political and economic situation in Soviet Russia, as well as the relationship between Russia and France, and the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday specially invited Russian Ambassador Yurenev to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the day of Ota's return to Beijing to express his sincerity on the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway and requested consideration from the Russian side. Hirota intends to take the opportunity of Ambassador Ota's return to the country to resolve the long-pending case in one fell swoop. The Russo-Japanese Fisheries Treaty will be revised next May, and Ambassador Ota will also extend his stay in Japan to exchange important opinions with Minister Hayashi and Ambassador Yurenev. In short, Ota's return to the country this time is a major turning point for Russo-Japanese relations, and his words and deeds with Foreign Minister Hirota are worthy of attention.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Indian Issues</h3>
<p>Secretary of State for India Moves Motion</p>
<p>Requesting Acceptance of the Constitutional Reform Plan</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of State for India Hoare moved a government motion in the House of Commons this afternoon, not only accepting the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform, but also advocating the introduction of the Indian Constitution Bill based on the outline of the committee's report. The House of Commons then began debating, which is expected to last for three days. On Wednesday, the last day of the House of Commons debate, the Labour Party will introduce an amendment, advocating that the report should stipulate that legislation recognizes India's right to be upgraded to the status of an overseas self-governing territory, stipulate the gradual development and expansion of responsible government in India in order to reach the status of an overseas self-governing territory, and stipulate that India has the possibility of seeking political power through constitutional procedures. On Tuesday night, the last speaker on behalf of the government will be Privy Councillor Baldwin. It is expected that the government will get a majority of votes when this motion is put to a vote. After the House of Commons debate is over, the House of Lords will also discuss the case, which will also take about three days and end on December 18. Unless there is a need to reconvene a special congress of the Conservative Party in January, this parliamentary discussion will be the final stage of the discussion on the Indian Constitution by the parliament and non-parliament. After that, the government can introduce the Indian Constitution Bill, which contains about 300 articles, all of which are about the progressive measures on the Indian Constitution. It is expected that the discussion of the details of this case and its final passage will occupy most of the parliament's time in 1935. When the House of Commons began debating Secretary of State for India Hoare's motion today, the meeting was packed. Hoare spoke and asked the House of Commons to accept the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, and said that the government is considering the report of the Joint Select Committee based on the proposal to support India and make it always a part of the British Empire. Indian public figures have long heard the teachings of using the Westminster Constitution as a model to engage in work. Indian social problems must be handled by responsible Indian politicians to be effective. This situation is becoming more and more obvious now. He does not want to make optimistic remarks hastily. In the future, he may encounter irreversible difficulties and suffer many disappointments. But he believes that the new constitution may develop along a very unique outline, rather than following the Westminster model. He is convinced that if a case is passed according to the outline of the Joint Select Committee report, then this constitution can be handled. The Indian National Congress has won a great victory in the recent parliamentary elections, which he does not regard as a strange thing. He knew early on that the National Congress would win many seats. For several years, the Indian Governor and he have had a certain policy to make the National Congress break away from the desolate situation of non-cooperation and join the responsible public work in the parliament. If a system that must rely on criticizing the government to succeed still exists, then the result of the Indian election will ultimately be like this. This is the lesson learned from this election. The measures to improve the Indian Constitution are proposed based on its advantages, and not because of weakness and timidity, we have to give in. We propose improvement measures only because we are convinced that it can improve Indian politics and make India a satisfactory member of the British Empire and British cooperation. The Labour Party's Attlee, on behalf of the opposition party, criticized this report for not mentioning India's goal of achieving the status of an overseas self-governing territory, saying that the Labour Party wants to see a constitution that can enable the Indian people to break away from social and economic evils. After 150 years of being ruled by the United Kingdom, the Indian people realize that they are still poor and ignorant. The British are slow to give responsibility to India, which is the fault of the British, and makes the benefits that the British have given to India offset. We must know that the idea that white people must rule the Indians for their own good is the psychology of the Victorian era and is no longer appropriate. The Liberal Party's Foot succeeded in speaking and supported the government's motion. Several Conservative Party members also spoke in succession, some supporting and some opposing this case. Finally, Attorney General Somervell rose to end today's debate and explained the federal issue. At this point, the meeting was adjourned until tomorrow for further debate. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong Discusses the Difficulties of Provincial and Municipal Boundary Demarcation</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Believes There Is Fundamentally No New Boundary to Demarcate</p>
<p>Otherwise, the County Governance Would Face the Issue of Existence or Abolition</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping from Tianjin yesterday (7th) at 6:40 PM. After getting off the train, he returned to his private residence to rest. On the 8th, he visited Huang Fu and returned to Tianjin in the evening. According to Yu, [This trip was to visit Huang to report on the situation after the reorganization of the Provincial Government. Although the relocation of the Provincial Government to Baoding has been approved by the Central Government, the actual date of relocation has not yet been determined. The joint office operations of the Provincial Government and the establishment of departments in various counties will be implemented on New Year's Day next year. It is currently being actively prepared. The Beiping-Hebei boundary demarcation conference began in Nanjing on the 8th. The Hebei Provincial Government representatives Zhang Lisheng, Hu Yuanhui, Zhang Yinwu, and others have been appointed and have already gone to Nanjing. The Provincial Government's opinion on boundary demarcation is the same as the resolution of the first meeting of the Hebei Provincial Government some time ago: the previously defined area should be the scope of boundary demarcation. Tianjin reported that Zhao Dazhong went to Tangshan again, but the report received by the Provincial Government was that Zhao had previously gone to Suizhong. It is not yet known whether he is now in Tangshan] and so on.</p>
<p>Another report states that when Yu Xuezhong visited Huang Fu at 4 PM today (8th), he reported in detail on the reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government and the appointment of new officials. He left around 5 PM. Yu also said today that [Regarding the issue of Beiping-Hebei boundary demarcation, some parties still believe that the provincial and municipal boundaries are to be redrawn. After the reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government, the first meeting resolved that the boundary demarcation should be based on the original boundaries. The Provincial Government believes that there is fundamentally no new boundary to demarcate, because each county has a defined boundary. Once it is divided, the county that is drastically reduced will face the issue of existence or abolition. This morning, I read in the newspaper that Nanjing may only劃割大小汤山 and Nanyuan into Beiping. In this regard, Tangshan is within the boundary of Changping County, which is more than 40 li away from Beiping. If Tangshan is taken, who is responsible for those 40 li between Tangshan and Beiping? If that stretch is included as well, Changping will have lost so much territory that the point of its existence will be questioned. So I say that this matter cannot be decided until detailed discussion has occurred. And in the final decision, the Provincial Government will only listen to the orders of the Central Government. Because it is now winter, it is cold, and the end of the year is approaching, whether the relocation of the Provincial Government to Baoding can be completed and implemented before the new year has not yet been determined.

<h3>Fellow Countrymen from Northeast and Shandong Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Due to the Difficulty of Making a Living, They Are Returning to Shandong in Succession</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand People Have Returned in Recent Days</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The four northeastern provinces have been occupied by the Japanese military for three years. All interests and treasures have been exploited by the Japanese. This has led to economic stagnation and rural bankruptcy. The level of living has increased by a fold compared to the past. The fellow countrymen from Shandong who went outside the customs previously saved 50 or 100 yuan and sent it back to Shandong every year, but now due to the rise in the price of food such as sorghum and soybeans, the income is still the same as before, without any increase. Those with high incomes can only barely maintain their livelihood, and those with less income feel very inadequate. Moreover, it is now winter and approaching the end of the year. In recent days, all fellow countrymen from Shandong have returned to Shandong in succession. One route is to take the puppet Fengshan road to enter the customs and return to Shandong along the Jinpu Railway, and the other route is to take Dalian and take the sea route to Qingdao, and then return to their original hometown along the Jiaoji Line. Every day, there are as many as a thousand people and at least several hundred people. They are all returning to Shandong because they cannot bear the Japanese abuse and can only barely collect about 20 yuan of travel expenses. (9th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Guangxi Flee to Western Hunan</h3>
<p>Guangxi Troops Sent to Help Defend Eastern Guizhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Communist bandits Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, and Dong Litang, who fled to northern Guangxi, were very rampant when they arrived in Wenshi. After the Guangxi army concentrated its forces and launched attacks from Xinwei, Gulingtou, and other places, the Communist bandits suffered heavy casualties in the battles of Wenshi and Shitang. The Communist bandits had no intention of fighting and broke through the Quanzhou-Xing'an line, extending westward to western Hunan. Kong divided up a detachment to go south along Quanzhou, Guishan, and Zaojieshou, to constrain the Guangxi army to encircle from Guilin, in order to cover the fleeing bandits into western Hunan. Since the 2nd of this month, they have successively occupied the line from Xianshui to the west to Lutang and Luojiang. The main force fled to Meixi. The deputy commander of the Guangxi army, Bai Chongxi, is in charge of directing the armies to pursue and suppress them. He set off from Pingle to Xing'an at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to instruct the armies on the strategy of pursuit and suppression. At the same time, in order to assist the Guizhou army in blocking the attack, in addition to sending the 15th Army to track down and pursue the bandits, he also sent the 7th Army to bypass Guizhou to assist the Guizhou army and consolidate border defenses. The telegram from Bai received here roughly stated: (1) The bandits from Shitangxu, Mazidu, and Fuhuapu were defeated by our army at 4 PM yesterday (1st), and a full-scale pursuit began. Since this morning, the battlefield has been continuously cleared, and the advance has been made to the line of Lutang, west of Xianshui. The bandits fled to the roads to Tongmei and Xikou. I will transfer to Xing'an at 3 PM this afternoon (2nd) to handle the subsequent pursuit. (2) It is certain that the bandits who fought with our army this time are the main force of the pseudo-135th Army Group, numbering over 20,000. The remaining bandits fled from the road from Xianshui to the Mei Creek Estuary, and from the Che Tian to the Long Sheng Jiang Road from Yan (29th) onwards. According to the combined information from all parties, it is judged that the bandits still have at least 50,000 to 60,000 people. (3) In addition to the 15th Army tracking down and pursuing the bandits, the 7th Army will bypass the border between Guangxi and Guizhou to assist friendly forces in blocking. (4) In the five days of fighting with the bandits in the Xingquan border area, a total of over 1,000 bandits were killed, over 2,000 were captured, and there were 500 Guangxi bandits who originally belonged to Li Mingrui, who surrendered, and 5,200 guns were seized. Furthermore, among the captured bandits, in addition to those from this province who are intended to stay in Guangxi or be sent elsewhere, there are over 2,000 from various provinces, but mostly from Jiangxi and Hunan, and there are officials of all levels among them. Should they be sent to the Central Government, or should they be handed over to Brother Yun? (Note: i.e., He Jian) A telegraphic instruction is awaited. Chongxi Dong (2) sent a seal, etc. Yesterday another telegram was received, stating that the entire Guangxi 7th and 15th armies contacted the bandits' 13th Army Group in Jieshou on the 3rd. The bandits fought and retreated, and they will be unsupported. (5th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Loan Contract Signed</h3>
<p>Five Banks Start Paying the Funds</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Due to the severe drought in Anhui Province this year, the tax revenue has been sharply reduced. With the end of the year approaching, there are no administrative expenses to pay. Last month, the Provincial Government sent Finance Director Mao Longcao to Shanghai to borrow 800,000 yuan from five banks: Shanghai, Central, China, Jiaotong, and Shanghai Industrial Bank. Together with the 400,000 yuan previously promised by the Wuhu branch of each bank, the total is 1.2 million yuan, with the surplus of the salt revenue that Anhui Province should receive as collateral. After the arrangements were agreed upon, Mao took the draft contract back to Anhui and submitted it to the Provincial Government meeting for discussion. The original arrangements and draft contract were approved and sent to Li Shiqian, director of the Wuhu office, to be responsible for handling the liaison. After receiving the order, Director Li immediately began to contact the five branches of the Central Bank, etc. At the same time, the five branches also received a telegram from the Shanghai head office, notifying them of the results of the loan negotiations and ordering them to implement them in accordance with the agreed-upon arrangements. After several contacts between the two parties, all procedures have been completed. The Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office also submitted to the General Office for approval to use the 193,000 yuan monthly surplus of the Anhui Province collaboration as collateral. Therefore, the formal loan contract was signed at the Wuhu branch of the Central Bank today. At this point, the Anhui Province loan issue was completely settled. The amount of the loan undertaken by the five banks is 600,000 yuan from the Central Bank and a total of 600,000 yuan from the four banks of China, Jiaotong, Shanghai, and Shanghai Industrial Bank, making up the total of 1.2 million. Since the contract has been signed and the procedures have been arranged, the five branches have decided to pay 400,000 yuan first on the 15th of this month, another 400,000 yuan at the end of the year, and the remaining 3 to 400,000 yuan will be paid 200,000 yuan each on February 1st and June 1st next year. The loan stipulates a monthly interest rate of 8%, and starting from February next year, over 70,000 yuan will be withdrawn from the monthly surplus of 193,000 yuan in salt revenue to be repaid, and the full amount will be repaid in 20 months. With this large sum of money, the Anhui Provincial Government may be able to pass the end of this year safely. (10th)</p>
<h3>Repeated Seizure of Counterfeit Organizations of the East River in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Defection of the Pseudo-East River Guerrilla Leader</p>
<p>Guiding Military Police to Crack Down on Pseudo-Organizations</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Gu Dacun's remnant bandit group in the eastern district of Guangdong Province was encircled and suppressed by Zhang Ruigui's division in Nanshan in previous years. The operation lasted more than a year, and most of the bandits were wiped out. Gu led more than a thousand bandits to flee back to Tongziyang in Baxiang Mountain, Fengshun County. This spring, Deng Longguang's division again suppressed them, directing the police guards of various counties to cooperate in the suppression. The remnant bandits of Gu's forces had very few remaining members. Among them, Deng Caiping, the leader of the pseudo-East River guerrilla brigade, with dozens of followers, scattered into Jiulongzhang, Hanxi, Douxi, Yangqiankeng, and other areas at the intersection of Mei and Feng counties. Under the surveillance of the police and civilian militias of various districts and townships, they were unable to survive. Two months ago, they fled back into the Tongziyang mountains, building two thatched shelters to prepare for the winter. Upon receiving this information, He Yinghua's troops, the first battalion of the Second Regiment of the Independent Second Division of the Fengshun garrison, immediately joined forces with the civilian militias of various districts and townships to search and suppress them day and night. At that time, the bandits had nowhere to escape. On November 30th, Deng Caiping personally carried a Mauser pistol and hand grenades and surrendered to He's battalion, requesting permission to atone for his crimes through meritorious service. That very night, he guided the military police to crack down on the general headquarters of the Communist Party's Fengjie District Working Committee, killing Hu Gen, the pseudo-chairman and military commander, and two other key bandits. They captured five key East River bandits, seized two short guns, and a large quantity of reactionary propaganda. In recent days, due to Deng Caiping's defection, the East River communists knew that they could no longer hide and live in peace, and they also surrendered one after another. Wang Minduo, the commander of the third battalion, has been dispatched to Heshidun and other places in the third district of Fengshun in recent days to inspect defenses and rectify military discipline. He also cracked down on a communist organization in Changkeng Township, capturing key bandits Li Zima, Li Jinlu, female bandit Luo Meilu, and others on the spot, seizing several long guns. Li Zima then led the team to Dakeng Township, Jieyang County, to encircle and suppress the communists. The bandits fled upon hearing the news, and only the organization was destroyed. Battalion Commander Wang executed eleven important communists by firing squad a few days ago, including Peng Xinmin and Peng Daoming, members of the pseudo-Soviet executive committee of the Dabu-Fengshun district, Huang Teng, bandit soldier Cai Suixiang, Yang Miaojin, Zhang A Yuan, Zhang A Ding, members of the pseudo-Soviet executive committee of the Pailing district of Wuhua, as well as key bandits Chen Kang, Chen Weihua, Li Jinlu of Changkeng Township, female bandit department head Luo Meilu, and others, who were executed on the spot at the Tangkeng regimental headquarters. The East River communists can now be expected to be eradicated. (4th)</p>

<h3>Petition Representatives Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Result, Granted Amnesty</p>
<p>Legislative Reduction of Rent Ordered for Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles' Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs and the Committee for Reducing Rent, in order to request the Central Government to issue a clear order to pardon patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu and others, and to promulgate rent reduction regulations, respectively dispatched representatives to Beijing on the seventh of this month to petition. They have obtained considerable results and returned to Beijing by train yesterday. The details of the petition process are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Petition Representatives Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The All Circles' Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs, on the grounds that patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Zeng Songtao, Tian Shuiyang, and Pan Hongsheng, in the winter of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], were arrested by the Public Concession Police for throwing bombs to warn treacherous merchants, and were transferred to the First Special District Court and sentenced to severe penalties. Various legal groups in the city have repeatedly appealed for amnesty, but have not been granted approval. Recently, Pan Hongsheng accumulated resentment and became ill, and was on his deathbed. Fearing that Liu Chongwu and others might follow Pan's fate, representatives of various groups, including Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, Wang Jingdong, and Chen Peide, were elected as representatives and went to Beijing by express train on the seventh of this month to petition the Fifth Plenary Session, the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Judicial Yuan, and other agencies, requesting amnesty for them. They have achieved considerable results and returned to Shanghai by train yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sympathetic and Grants Amnesty</h3>
<p>Petition representatives Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, Wang Jingdong, and Chen Peide arrived in Beijing on the morning of the eighth. After resting briefly at the Central Hotel, they went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition. They were received by Secretary Ye Shizhi, who promised to submit the letter to the Secretary-General of the Fifth Plenary Session for review. They then went to the National Government, where they were received by Chief Secretary Wei Huai, who said that he would forward it to Chairman Lin and order the relevant authorities to handle it. Finally, they went to the Judicial Yuan, where they were received by Secretary-General Chen Gemei, who also gave a very satisfactory reply. At that time, the representatives believed that this trip was of great importance, and they could not return to Shanghai to report until they had personally met with the responsible officials. Representative Hu Fengxiang returned to Shanghai that evening because he felt slightly unwell. Chen, Yu, and Wang remained in Beijing to appeal. On the morning of the ninth, they went to the Judicial Yuan again and were personally received by President Ju. The representatives presented the earnest wishes of the various groups in person. Mr. Ju replied that he would be responsible for providing relief. The representatives were satisfied and left. In the afternoon, they visited various central committee members in Beijing to request justice in the General Assembly. The results were also very satisfactory. On the morning of the tenth, they went to the Fifth Plenary Session to petition and were received by Secretary-General Ye Chucang, who said that he would submit the presentation to the General Assembly and instruct the relevant authorities to handle it and asked the representatives to return to Shanghai that day and wait for the results. Therefore, the result has achieved a considerable purpose. They took the early express train back to Shanghai yesterday (the eleventh) to report the process to the Aid Association.</p>
<h3>Regularly Scheduled Meeting to Report the Process</h3>
<p>The All Circles' Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs, because this time the representatives were dispatched to Beijing to petition, requesting amnesty for Liu Chongwu and others, the result was quite satisfactory. In order to report the process to the various groups, it is now scheduled to convene a temporary executive committee meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the sixteenth of this month (Saturday) at the Tianhougong Bridge Meeting Hall, and to dispatch representatives to visit the families of the problem fighters and comfort the fighters in prison.</p>
<h3>Petition to Reduce Rent Ordered for Review and Handling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Committee for Reducing Rent, in light of the current commercial depression, the original rent is really difficult to bear, in order to request the Fifth Plenary Session to issue a clear order to promulgate rent reduction regulations, then dispatched representatives Liu Zhongying, Wang Jingdong, etc., to Beijing on the evening of the ninth to petition. After the representatives arrived in Beijing, they went to the Fifth Plenary Session on the morning of the tenth to petition. They were received by Assembly Secretary Ye Shizhi, who promised to submit the presentation to the Presidium for further review and handling. The representatives also returned to Shanghai by train yesterday to report the process to the association.</p>
<p>Also remitted travel expenses of two hundred yuan, I also sent a letter stating that it was not appropriate, and returned the original money, but I am deeply afraid that my humble name will still be included in the Ministry of Finance's report, so I specifically inquired with the Ministry of Finance. According to the person in charge, the name listed was Ma Yun-chu, not Ma Yin-chu, etc. Since my name was not listed in the report, I did not immediately publish a statement at that time. Today I was very surprised to read the news in the newspapers that I was a director of the bank. All letters from the bank have been well preserved, etc.</p>
<h3>Hu Shuhua and Others Telegraph the Central Government to Rotate Salt Transportation</h3>
<p>To enrich the national treasury and maintain education</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua, President of Hunan University, and 37 others from the education sector of Hunan Province telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the various departments of the Yuan Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Bureau, and the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, requesting the rotation of salt transportation, and designated educational funds to be allocated from the salt tax. The original text is as follows: "In recent years, since the inspection agency has concurrently handled salt administration, the tax system has been reorganized and the accumulated malpractices have been eliminated. Therefore, the number of sales and tax revenues have increased, which is due to the central salt administration authorities' efforts to govern with diligence and set an example, and the local salt affairs agencies' compliance with the handling. The educational funds that should be allocated from the salt tax in this province are all allocated on schedule. Educators are extremely grateful. Now, at the time of the salt tax reorganization, and at a time when academic funds are difficult, I do not hesitate to express my concerns and earnestly appeal for a clear order to be issued to allocate all academic funds in Hunan Province from the salt tax, so that teaching will become more widespread and learning will continue. Education in Hunan Province is deeply dependent on this. Furthermore, the educational funds of various provinces and counties mostly rely on various additional levies for support. Now, if we want to abolish harsh and miscellaneous levies, we must first reorganize the regular taxes and allocate them separately. Therefore, educators all hope for the reform of salt affairs. The way to reform is to first reduce the price of salt farms to reduce costs, improve the quality of refined salt to emphasize hygiene, and use rotation transportation to be quick and cost-effective and avoid drowning and loss. At the same time, for the boatmen and coolies of the Twelve Forts, the current preparation fees should be used to plan for their livelihoods. Only in this way can the price be low and the quality be good, the number of sales will be smoother, and tax revenue can be increased. In the future, the educational funds of various provinces can be uniformly allocated from the salt tax to consolidate the foundation of education and establish a century-long plan. I respectfully offer my humble opinions and ask for your consideration. In my urgent telegram, I cannot help but await your command."</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Rectifies the Economy of Mass Organizations</h3>
<p>Income and expenditure of funds should be registered and published monthly</p>
<p>The Party Department sends personnel to review accounts at the end of each month</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city believes that the mass organizations in the city are often caused disputes due to economic insincerity and openness. For the sake of rectification, the Municipal Party Department of this city issued an order yesterday to all mass organizations in the city. From now on, income and expenditure of funds should be registered and published monthly. The original order is recorded as follows: "[In order to comply with the order, it is found that the mass organizations in the city often do not keep accurate accounts of income and expenditure of funds, and do not open up sincerely. The organizers even abuse them at will. Once someone is reported, they often decorate their words and shirk their responsibilities. Therefore, disputes occur frequently. In order to rectify the mass movement, the association has specially stipulated that all mass organizations must keep a record of each item of income and expenditure of funds in the future, and keep the various receipts separately, and register and publish them monthly in order to verify and maintain public trust.

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Advise and Warn Stamp Inspectors</h3>
<p>Do not act hastily</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, saying, "The letter from the Biscuit Candy Canned Food Industry Association received on the eighth of this month stated, 'Our association has received a letter from member Taikang Company, reporting that a stamp tax bureau inspector recently came to our company to inspect stamps with a detective from the police. They shouted and rushed around, and the situation was tense, as if they were arresting important criminals. As a result, 27 account books were taken away, 23 of which were copies of the daily business volume reports from each branch to the head office. The original books with sufficient stamps affixed are kept in each branch. These copies are sent to the head office for reference on a daily basis, and there is no need to affix stamps again. This can be based on the tax bureau's reply letter explaining,' etc. Accordingly, it is found that the inspectors inspect the stamps, and if there are any omissions, the maximum punishment is to be imposed in accordance with the regulations. It cannot be equated with illegal or criminal behavior that violates the law. Inspectors should act peacefully and guide in a gentle and tactful manner when performing their duties. How can they act like a bully, arrogant and unreasonable? This matter is related to disturbing the peace of the shops, and it is necessary to transfer the letter to the tax bureau for strict correction. Moreover, there is an explanation that copies do not need to be stamped. Please also ask your association to negotiate with the tax bureau and present it to the Ministry of Finance for thorough investigation and prevention, so as to reassure the business community," etc. When the association arrived, it was found that when the stamp tax was executed, the person concerned should be treated with a peaceful attitude, explaining the reasons and ordering him to hand over the documents that should be stamped. Do not act hastily. Not only have the orders and advice of the Ministry of Finance been historically obeyed, but also this article is included in Article 13 of the recent Inspection Rules for Stamp Tax. Public officials who execute inspections in various places should abide by them uniformly. However, the Shanghai Special Zone has historically had a cooperative relationship with detectives. These people have accumulated habits under foreigners and rely on the fact that laws and judgments are beyond their reach. All measures are enough to make merchants pay attention. Moreover, with the relationship between commission and reward, it is inevitable to act hastily. The company that feels this kind of pain is not only Taikang Company. Now that the Ministry of Finance has promulgated the Inspection Rules for Stamp Tax, the Shanghai Special Zone should also have the obligation to respect and abide by it. In view of the previous situation, it is appropriate to prepare another document and telegraph to the Ministry of Finance for review, and to order the competent authorities to advise and warn strictly, so as to make public use. Keng, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Summary of Relief Work by the Chinese Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the Chinese Jisheng Society held a meeting the day before yesterday. First, the economic director reported the receipt and expenditure of funds. Then, the relief director proposed that the major disaster is getting worse and worse. This winter, the business is in a depression. The enthusiastic charitable comrades of the past are now too busy to take care of themselves. Although they tried their best to send personnel to investigate and release the urgent relief in Hai'ning, they also received the support of the gentry in the county and the Chinese and foreign volunteer relief societies. The victims were able to spend the rest of the winter. The relief in Haiyan has not yet been effectively carried out because the relief funds are extremely short. Once there is a clue, they will select personnel to set off. Major disaster counties in Jiangsu Province have not been able to hold them, let alone Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The relief director said that the funds for cotton clothing and porridge factories in Shanghai have also not been secured. In this situation of widespread mourning, the old and weak are turning to ditches and gullies, and the strong are scattered in all directions. This is what we are distressed and saddened about. If we do not embellish it a little, we cannot avoid being焦灼 on our conscience. I hope that enthusiastic charitable compatriots will take off their clothes and push their food to save these helpless orphans.</p>
<h3>The Turbine Association sent a letter to the Sanbei Company</h3>
<p>Petition for the Families of the Victims of the Taishan Ship</p>
<p>The Taishan ship of the Sanbei Company has been in distress for nearly two weeks. All the families of the turbine staff who were victims have recently approached the China Turbine Association, requesting it to negotiate and handle the aftermath and condolences on their behalf. According to the association's information, it sent a letter to the Sanbei Company saying, "After the Taishan ship disaster, the matter of searching for corpses, placing them in coffins, and providing generous condolences and handling the aftermath has been communicated to your company on the fourth of this month. However, several days have passed and there has been no reply. Now, according to the notification from the families of the victims, the company is currently only willing to pay the arrears of the crew's salary. Other condolences are temporarily not discussed and are considered inappropriate and unwilling to accept. It has been found that when crew members are in distress, the families are extremely sad and wish they were dead. Asking for condolences adds another sadness to the company each time, and some even say that they cover their ears and cry when they mention the name of the Sanbei Company and do not want to hear it. Given the scale of your company and the virtue and prestige of the person in charge, you are always enthusiastic about supporting social welfare, so why would you be harsh to others when things happen to you and endure sitting by and watching the families of the victims wait to die? Therefore, the association believes that all condolences should be paid in full as soon as possible in accordance with the provisions of the Maritime Law to avoid delays and resolve them as soon as possible. It is appropriate to send a letter accordingly, asking you to investigate and reply."</p>
<h3>Lawyers who are in arrears with membership fees will be withdrawn</h3>

The association is eager to hold the autumn conference, so it was decided to urge the members who are in arrears to pay the arrears by December 11. If they do not pay the arrears to the association, they will report the withdrawal of the association in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the members who are in arrears had to pay the arrears to the association after receiving this reminder. As of yesterday (December 11), there were still more than 100 people who had not paid. If they do not pay immediately, the list will be opened and reported to the courts at all levels in accordance with the regulations, and the members who are in arrears will be withdrawn from the association.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Government from the Five Exchange Brokers' Associations</h3>
<p>Requesting a Temporary Suspension of Exchange Tax Collection</p>
<p>A joint petition from the brokers' associations of the Flour, Cotton Yarn, Securities, Gold, and Miscellaneous Grains Exchanges to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a temporary suspension of the exchange tax collection, states: "In recent years, the world has been plagued by the economic crisis, and domestically, we have been beset by the concurrent pressures of floods, droughts, and banditry, leading to increasing rural bankruptcy and famine. Commerce and industry are in decline, and the circulation of wealth is increasingly constricted. China's overall economic activity is deteriorating, and the prospect of a crisis fills us with dread. The exchange is the command center of modern economic organization. Since the economy is in such a state of decline, its manifestation in the exchange is the gradual decline of buying and selling. Taking the trading volume of flour as an example, in 1931, it still reached around 30,000 bags; in 1932, it had decreased to 10,000 bags; and in 1933, it was less than 10,000 bags. In three years, it has gradually decreased by two-thirds. As for the gold industry, this year's trading volume is only half of that in 1930. The buying and selling of other items, such as securities, cotton yarn, and miscellaneous grains, are all in the same situation, trending towards decline. The business of merchants depends entirely on the amount of buying and selling transactions. Therefore, the large reduction in trading volume indirectly indicates the decline in the business of merchants. Furthermore, for several years, although business conditions have reached a dead end, merchants have still maintained this depressed situation, always with the aim of revitalizing commerce and industry. The exchange is the price stabilization mechanism for commerce and industry, the centralized mechanism for large-scale supply and demand in commerce and industry, the adjustment mechanism for supply and demand in commerce and industry, the risk transfer mechanism for commerce and industry, and the commodity circulation mechanism for commerce and industry. Therefore, if merchants only consider their own interests and fail to maintain this bleak situation, it would be tantamount to inflicting a fatal blow to China's entire commerce and industry, making the dim future of commerce and industry even darker. The stagnation of the exchange would also create opportunities for foreigners to control our commerce and industry. In the past, before Chinese-owned exchanges were established, the market prices of all commodities were based on the prices of foreign-owned trading houses and Japanese-owned exchanges. All price fluctuations were based on the interests of foreigners, while Chinese people were in a passive position, allowing foreigners to control China's economic power. Therefore, learning from the past, merchants, despite their declining profits, are unwilling to easily abandon the Chinese-owned exchanges that have been gained over the past decade, and give foreigners the tools to subvert and manipulate our commerce and industry. In recent years, merchants have provided considerable convenience to those who entrust buying and selling transactions in the exchange, to the extent possible, such as reducing commissions and providing advances on trading margins. As long as it is within their capabilities, they will do everything possible to accommodate them. More convenience for buyers and sellers means more opportunities for activity in China's commerce and industry. As for government bond trading, more convenience for buyers and sellers means not only more opportunities for activity in the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors, but also more flexibility in the management of national finances. However, reducing commissions and advancing margins are not only sacrifices and losses for the personal interests of merchants, but also involve great risks. Therefore, in recent years, the business of merchants has not only declined on the surface, but has also been a sacrifice in reality. Our government authorities are well aware of this situation and do not need merchants to complain about it. Recently, we heard that the Ministry of Finance intends to levy a considerable transaction tax on buying and selling in the exchange, and the tax rate has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. In theory, merchants would not dare to oppose the collection of this transaction tax. However, in light of today's reality, in order to save the depressed commercial situation, it is necessary to temporarily suspend the collection of the transaction tax. Otherwise, the tax rate must be suitable for China's current situation and should be reduced to a level that buyers and sellers can bear. The organization and legislation of our country's exchanges are mostly based on Japan. Now, let us cite the Japanese transaction tax rate for reference:</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Tax Law (Revised in April, 1922), Article 5: "For buying and selling transactions within the exchange that are settled by the transfer of margin differences, a transaction tax shall be levied on the amount of each transaction agreement at the following tax rates: Category 1: Buying and selling transactions of local bonds or corporate bonds: A. Transactions with a performance period within seven days: 0.006%. B. Other: 0.01%. Category 2: Buying and selling transactions of securities: A. Transactions with a performance period within seven days: 0.015%. B. Other: 0.025%. Category 3: Buying and selling transactions of commodities: 0.025%. The tax shall not be waived even if the buying and selling contract is canceled. Article 7: Buying and selling transactions of national bonds shall not be subject to transaction tax."</p>
<p>From the intent of the Japanese Exchange Tax Law, the following points can be summarized: 1. No tax is levied on spot transactions, and the transaction tax is limited to futures trading (forward or periodic). Spot trading within the exchange is no different from spot trading outside the exchange. If no tax is levied outside the exchange, why should it be different inside the exchange? The reason for taxing futures trading is to make the exchange market more robust. 2. For periodic trading of securities, the tax is lower for short-term and higher for long-term, reflecting the nature of securities trading and the desire to shift from a long-term to a short-term basis. 3. The commodity transaction tax is the same as the long-term transaction rate for securities, because short-term transactions in the commodity futures market are not of great significance in the exchange, so there is no need to reduce the tax rate to encourage them. 4. National bond transactions are not taxed, in order to promote the popularity and flexible circulation of national bonds. In essence, there is no need to impose a high tax rate to suppress speculation. 5. Buying and selling transactions of local bonds and corporate bonds have a lower tax rate than other types of transaction taxes, in order to promote their popularity and flexibility. 6. The transaction tax is levied on the agreed amount, so when settlement and offsetting are carried out according to the opposite transaction, both the previous and subsequent agreements are taxed. When actual delivery is carried out, only half of the offsetting transaction is taxed. Swap transactions are not taxed separately because they are not new transactions.</p>
<p>Looking back at the current situation in our country, the level of economic development is far inferior to Japan, the foundation of the exchange is not as solid as Japan's, and the overall economic situation is not as good as Japan's. Therefore, if our country must collect a transaction tax today, there are many aspects of Japan's current tax law that can be adopted. What needs to be noted is that, given the current depression of commerce and industry in our country, the collection of the tax should be temporarily suspended or the tax rate should be reduced as much as possible. In other words, in the current economic downturn in our country, the following four points must be the principles for collecting transaction tax: 1. Buying and selling of national bonds and local public bonds should be exempt from tax. 2. For periodic trading of securities (including stocks, corporate bonds, and others), the tax should be lower for short-term and higher for long-term. The tax rate for the former should not exceed 0.0025%, and the tax rate for the latter should not exceed 0.005%. 3. The tax rate for commodity trading should not exceed 0.005%, regardless of whether it is short-term or long-term. 4. Commodity trading should be taxed based on the agreed amount of the transaction, not based on the quantity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in today's China, where economic crises are breaking out on all sides, the entire nation must cultivate its vitality and strive to recover in the short term. Excessive transaction tax collection may cause unexpected economic panic. Merchants have been making their greatest efforts to contribute to the future development of China's commerce and industry, so we dare to present our humble views for consideration."</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Cracking Down on Illegal Attic Construction</h3>
<p>Ratepayers' Association Asks Public Works Bureau Not to Be Too Demanding</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Settlement sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "To the Public Works Bureau: According to a letter from Wang Xiaozhai, our factory received a letter No. 5885 from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau on the 4th, stating that the addition of three attic rooms on the property of the factory's location, No. 567 on the Public Works Bureau's register, violates Article 30 of the Land Regulations and orders them to be demolished within seven days. Our factory has been renting the premises of the owner, Wang Maoji, for more than ten years, but no part of the building has been altered, nor has an attic been added. Fearing that there might be some misunderstanding, the Association sent a special letter in reply. Our factory is a manufacturing factory, and there are many workers in the factory. If the Department demolishes the building suddenly, regardless of the facts, the loss of work and the livelihoods of all the workers will be greatly affected. Therefore, we earnestly request your Association to convey the situation to the Bureau so that our factory can inquire with the owner about the original building plans and verify them, etc. The reasons for the existence of the attic have been repeatedly explained to your Bureau. If the attic mentioned in the above letter is indeed real, then the fact that it has been able to be built up to now indicates that there is a background to the matter, which can be easily imagined. In short, the Bureau must take detailed account of the state of the social economy. If shops and residents could all obtain whatever income they wanted, would they not wish to use foreign-style houses and mansions? We are writing to request your Bureau to order the relevant department not to be overly demanding under any pretext, and to show consideration for the difficulties of the residents."</p>
<p>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>Preparing to Inspect Imported Livestock</p>
<p>Starting with Dairy Cows?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has only inspected exported livestock products, not imported livestock. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry believes that in recent years, unprecedented diseases in our country's livestock have mostly been introduced from abroad and spread inland, causing great harm. For example, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and abortion disease have gradually spread throughout the country due to the lack of inspection of imported foreign livestock, resulting in great losses. In order to prevent the introduction and spread of such livestock diseases, it is necessary to start inspecting imported livestock as soon as possible. It is reported that the project will start with imported dairy cows from Shanghai and then gradually extend to other livestock. The Bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Industry to prepare for the project and has submitted detailed rules and estimates to the Ministry for approval. It is currently engaged in preparations and it is expected that inspection can be implemented by January of next year.</p>

<p>Sole Distribution by China Cooperative Wholesale Department</p>
<p>Nanfeng honey oranges, produced in Nanfeng, Jiangxi, are the best of China's citrus fruits and have been famous throughout the world as a tribute of past dynasties. It is reported that since the National Army recovered Nanfeng County, the Jiangxi Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee has worked hard to organize cooperatives and engage in production. The honey oranges are transported to Shanghai by the Yumin Bank, organized by farmers' marketing cooperatives, and entrusted to the China Cooperative Wholesale Department at 259 Minkuo Road, XinKaiHe, as the sole distributor. The Guanshengyuan on Great Eastern Road also sells them. They are fresh, fragrant, and truly nourishing and soothing to the throat. The people of Shanghai are fortunate to enjoy them. However, the number of arrivals is limited.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs' Subsidy Measures for Exported Firewood Tax</h3>
<p>Tax Rate Calculated at One Dime Per 100 Kilograms</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has issued a notice regarding the temporary subsidy measures for the tax on firewood transported abroad, in accordance with the order.

From December 1st of this year, all firewood transported abroad shall be calculated at a rate of one dime (National Currency) per 100 kilograms according to Tariff No. 152 of the Export Tariff. If the tax collected exceeds 5% of the value, it shall be temporarily taxed at 5% of the value. However, firewood transported within the country to various ports shall still be taxed at the corresponding tax rate in the Transit Tariff. All merchants are hereby informed. Superintendent Tang Hai'an. Customs Commissioner Botlerd."</p>
<h3>Xin Pinghu Steamer Aground in Fog</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Pinghu-Shanghai Steamer Bureau has three steamers: Xin Pinghu, Shanghai, and Lao Pinghu, which run exclusively between Shanghai and Pinghu. Now Lao Pinghu has been leased out. Xin Pinghu and Shanghai steamers are dispatched daily at 7:00 AM and 1:00 PM, departing from Pinghu and Shanghai respectively, carrying passengers and cargo.

<h3>Contract Dissolved</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Steamer Company converted the former Dachang steamer to the Yongjia steamer and, represented by the company, joined the Shensha route and began operating on the 6th of this month. As a result, the Shensha steamer companies decided to dissolve the Shensha Steamer Cooperation Office after a meeting, and signed a dissolution agreement on the 8th of this month, which took effect on the 9th, with the office closed and the organization dissolved, returning to the individual companies for management.</p>
<h3>Price War</h3>
<p>On the day of the dissolution, the steamer companies immediately engaged in price competition, such as: (1) Passenger tickets: during cooperation, first-class cabins were $1.80, now $1.00; second-class cabins were $1.20, now $0.80; third-class cabins were $0.80, now $0.60; and steerage was $0.60, now $0.40.

The body was recovered by Haizhou Steamer and was put into a coffin on the ship, brought to Dapu, and buried on their behalf. After getting the telegram, Mr. Qin reported it to the Sanbei Company. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately asked Yongji to inform Haizhou Steamer to bring Luo A'hu's body to Shanghai, but Yongji Steamer had already sailed into Wusong, and could not reach Haizhou Steamer again. It is also heard that the American Asiatic Shipping Company's Xuzhou Steamer also discovered the Taishan Steamer's sampan between 121 degrees east longitude and 35 degrees north latitude, as well as life jackets and damaged lifebuoys floating on the sea.</p>

<p>Coppersmith Robbed, Bound, and Imprisoned</p>
<p>Injured Falling From Window</p>
<p>Shuisheng You, a native of Ningbo, is 30 years old. He lives at No. 8, Taipingfang, Yucai Road, Hongzhen. He is a coppersmith at Yuanchang Machinery Factory on Yuezhou Road. At 2:00 PM yesterday, when Shuisheng You was repairing machinery at a tobacco factory at No. 3 Depei Lane, Yokohama Road, Zhabei, two robbers suddenly appeared, holding guns. The robbers mistakenly thought Shuisheng You was the owner of the factory and tied his hands with ropes. Being upstairs, the robbers began searching. They took dozens of silver dollars and a gold ring. While the robbery was taking place, Shuisheng You took the opportunity to escape from the window, intending to blow a police whistle to alert others. In a hurry, Shuisheng You mistakenly stepped on the lead-glass skylight and fell, injuring his left shoulder and hip. Someone called the police at post No. 2525 of the North Station Branch, who rushed to the scene and hired a rickshaw to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

The reasons are as follows: It is estimated that Shanghai has a population of 5 million. Except for landowners, property owners, and foreigners, who number about 500,000, the remaining 4.5 million people must rent houses. The rent paid each year, on average, accounts for about two-thirds of their annual income. In the past, when the market was prosperous and commerce was thriving, they could barely manage and were not completely destitute. Now, with the global economic crisis and the surge of rural bankruptcy in China, the impact on Shanghai is obvious and undeniable. If this continues, not only will commerce be unable to prosper and the market will be unable to thrive, but also this huge population will starve to death and will not be able to survive. This is the first reason why rent reduction should be vigorously implemented. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, vitality has been almost lost and not yet recovered. Poverty is increasing, and beggars and starving people fill the streets. People are too busy saving their lives to have any purchasing power. Therefore, goods are piling up and sales are difficult, finance is stagnating, and the imbalance is alarming. Various tragic realities are presented before our eyes. The reasons are complex, but the biggest reason is that rents are too high. The blood and sweat of most citizens, in addition to paying most of their money for rent, are not enough to keep them warm and fed. This is the second reason why rent reduction should be vigorously implemented. Since this committee was established in January of this year, it has been working actively, day and night. Now, in Shanghai, under organized control, the establishment of branch committees and sub-committees in various lanes and neighborhoods, calling for action, has spread throughout the city. As a result, rent reductions have been achieved, such as in the Minkuo Road area, where it has reached one-third. However, many greedy and stubborn people, using the law as protection, relying on the concession as a stronghold, either ignore the call or file lawsuits, while many remain on the sidelines. Although we have repeatedly petitioned the party and government agencies, this matter is important. Without the power of political forces, it is not enough to raise awareness. This is the third reason why we should request the meeting to discuss the matter and make a decision, and send a letter to the administrative agencies to assist us. The methods are as follows: (1) The meeting should discuss the matter in detail, make a decision, and send a letter to the National Government, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government, the local court, and all agencies to provide assistance in various ways, so that this rent reduction movement can be deepened and spread widely, in order to achieve complete success. (2) According to the Shanghai land price standards promulgated by the Shanghai Land Bureau this year, calculate the land price and add the construction cost to determine the cost of the house. The rent rate should be determined according to this cost. In addition to the landlord's land tax and house tax, it should not exceed the statutory amount (originally 10%, but now it is too high, and it is specified separately by the court). For those whose construction date is unknown, an estimate must also be made, so that fairness and impartiality are the criterion and both the landlord and tenant can be at peace. Rent reduction is a need of the times, and we speak out on behalf of the people. We ask the officials of the party and the state to pay attention to the suffering of the people and to discuss and approve this proposal in the meeting for discussing national affairs, and to implement it vigorously, then Shanghai will be fortunate and China will be very fortunate. This matter concerns the lives of the people, and we anxiously await rescue. Respectfully presented to the Presidium of the Fifth Plenary Committee of the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Heavy Fog in Wusong Estuary</p>
<h3>Another Report on Capsized Sailboat</h3>
<p>Hua'an Shipowner Claims Sailboat Self-Collided</p>
<p>Six People Rescued by Hua'an on the Spot</p>
<p>The Dang'an Company sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "To the Editor: We have just seen a report in today's newspaper about the Hua'an steamer sinking a large sailboat in the heavy fog, which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The Hua'an steamer arrived at this port last night. According to the captain's report, at 1:00 PM today (the 10th), it anchored near the S.E. Knoll buoy due to the fog. At 1:40 PM, a sailboat, fully rigged and moving with the current, sailed towards the bow of the Hua'an. Seeing this situation, the ship immediately ordered the sailors to loosen the anchor chain to reduce the force of the sailboat's collision. However, time was pressing, and it was too late. The hull of the sailboat was damaged, and seawater poured in. The captain of the sailboat, seeing the dangerous situation, wanted to turn the rudder to approach the Hua'an in order to escape. However, the tidal currents were turbulent, and there was a second collision, damaging the ship".</p>

Over 200 elementary, middle, and high schools have not yet come to the committee to collect their receipts. The committee has sent letters urging them to come within three days to collect their receipts. Those who fail to collect their receipts by the deadline will be publicly announced in the news. As for the worker universal donation, in addition to the municipal government issuing notices and publishing announcements in the newspaper for all workers, staff, and factories to deduct and submit donations to the Shanghai Bank, the General Labor Union has also, in conjunction with various labor unions, notified all workers in the city. The Urgent Disaster Relief Universal Donation Committee has also sent letters to all factories, starting immediately, to handle the universal donations of factory workers and staff, and to quickly remit the donations to the Shanghai Bank to help the disaster victims.</p>
<p>The donation from wealthy individuals is the most important donation for the universal relief effort. In addition to the Universal Donation Committee conducting its own thorough investigation into the names, aliases, addresses, and occupations of wealthy individuals residing in Shanghai, it has also sent letters to the drought relief associations in various provinces for further investigation. This is expected to be completed in the next few days. After a meeting is held in the coming days, the universal donation from wealthy individuals will begin.</p>
<p>The Urgent Relief Committee recently sent letters to the Railway Bureau, Telephone Bureau, Post Office, and Jiangnan Shipyard, requesting them to encourage all staff and workers to donate to the urgent relief effort for the disaster areas, so as to accumulate small contributions into a large sum and provide universal relief to the disaster victims. Yesterday, Ni Tianyu from the Jiangnan Shipyard came to the committee to discuss the matter and collect the receipt procedures. It has been decided that starting today, donations will be solicited from all employees.</p>

<h3>Praises China Economic Credit Cooperative Society</h3>
<p>Called the Starting Point of China's Cooperative Enterprise</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative Society in this city has been working hard since its establishment and has achieved remarkable results. The society is large in scale, but its cost savings are unmatched by any other organization in Shanghai. The building, which stands majestically at No. 918 Edward Road, has monthly expenses of only 900 yuan.

<h3>Movies</h3>

The director is Ying Yunwei, and the main actors are Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er. Although they are newcomers to the film industry, they have long had a considerable position in the drama world. The success of this film is even more unexpected than we thought. It is said that the film is scheduled to be officially screened at the Jincheng Grand Theatre at 10:00 AM today (Wednesday), and invitations have been sent to all walks of life to attend. It is rumored that it will be publicly screened at the theatre soon.</p>
<h3>Medical World</h3>
<p>▲ Achievements of Young Doctor Li Zhonglu: The young doctor Li Zhonglu is the son of the famous doctor Li Menghua of Baitang. He specializes in internal and surgical medicine. He participated in the revolution in his early years. After the Northern Expedition, he devoted himself to medicine and worked hard at the first and second National Medical and Pharmaceutical Group Representatives Conferences. Most of the local medical and pharmaceutical construction projects in this county were carried out by him. This summer, he was hired by the Shanghai Municipal Construction Factory Association to serve as a medical consultant, saving countless lives. Zhang Xinbao, a construction industry operator, happened to fall ill at the Ningbo branch factory and, admiring Dr. Li's reputation, specifically asked to return to Shanghai for treatment. After being treated, he recovered from his illness in less than ten days. The clinic is located at No. 12 Tianyou Lane, Xujiahui.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: The Poor Girl Dislikes The West Tutor</p>
<p>When she was feeling extremely upset, Zhu Yueying smoothed out her face with an even layer of powder. She dipped the powder puff into the powder jar and said to Xiao Ji, "I've done everything you told me to. What else is there to say?" Xiao Ji had originally wanted to say a few more words to her, but then he thought, it was already hard enough to get her to this point. If he said something that upset her, and she refused to go to the front, then all his efforts would be in vain. So, he smiled at her and said, "You're very clever. Just touch up your face a bit. That's enough. There's no need to overdo it. I'll take you there." Auntie Hu heard this and came over to pull Yueying's sleeve, smiling and whispering, "Go on, it's alright. I'll be with you." Yueying lowered her head and followed the direction of her pull, slowly walking while holding onto the wall. When Auntie Hu pulled her into the courtyard, she flung her hand away, pulled her sleeve back, and said with her head slightly lowered, "I'm not a little child of three or two years old. What do I need you to hold me for?" Auntie Hu looked back at her, and she saw that her cheeks were puffed up. Auntie Hu stopped and said to her, "That's not right of you. Not counting our family, you still have two family members closely following behind you, all hoping that you can find them a way to make a living. If you go to see people looking like you're collecting debts, how will they be happy? Even like this, can things be done? It's not that I, as your aunt, want to interfere in your affairs. Who told your three generations to come all the way here to find me? If you don't want to do this, I don't want to do this even more." As she spoke, she slowly lowered her expression, and continued, "You don't have to go then. Your three generations can take flight and go far away. Don't come and burden me, this pitiful person."

<h3>A Group of Street Artists</h3>
<p>— Xunzi</p>
<p>Walking along Avenue Joffre, to the west of the Empire Theater, there is a horizontal street where a very famous temple in Shanghai is located, called Guoren Temple. Opposite it is a French Catholic church. Facing each other, the religions are different, the nationalities are different, and the colors are not harmonious. The two buildings are forever facing each other in silence.</p>
<p>Because both sides are surrounded by walls, the cement sidewalk is occupied by street artists as their territory. A man in his fifties, with a mustache like the Chinese character "eight" on his lip, sat listlessly on a bench. On a board table in front of him were all his tools of the trade. It turned out he was a character splitter who also wrote letters for people. Although it was early, !twelve o'clock noon!, there was already a female patron engaging him to write a letter. The patron, with her plump figure and several pure gold rings on her fingers, quite large, showed her wealth. She looked like an old madam from a "wild chicken" brothel. Because she was from Yangzhou and the character splitter was from Shaoxing, their dialects were different, so every sentence they wrote required several back-and-forth entanglements.</p>
<p>On the cement, four words written in white powder, "Open-air Stage", circled a large pair of artists of the opposite sex. The man had a sparse fake beard hanging from his lips, and his nose was smeared with white powder and black ink, symbolizing a clown on the stage. He also had a small braid sticking up on his forehead. He was shaking a broken palm-leaf fan in his hand. One moment he made jokes and gestures, the next he hummed a "Xipi Yaoban" tune, busy enough to have beads of sweat oozing from his skin. The woman standing next to him was still dressed normally, without makeup, but her clothes were shiny and greasy, like a barber's cloth for shaving heads, and her face was the color of paper ingots. Although her hair had not been cut, it was as loose and messy as a pile of firewood, fully revealing that she was a believer in morphine and heroin. She was keeping time with the male performer's lyrics, playing a erhu. When it was her turn to open her mouth, she would also hum a few lines, surprisingly accurate and clear, without any dissonance. The audience standing there, because they were of the opposite sex, shouted "Bravo!" like crazy.</p>
<p>On this cement sidewalk, there were a total of three or four open-air stages like this, performed by men and women together. Because going to the theater to listen to a play cost at least ten cents, but here, you only needed one copper coin to listen to your fill, so their livelihood was not bad.</p>
<p>There were also several storytellers who had not apprenticed to a master, nor had they joined any Guangyu or Runyu societies. Just because they were poor and down on their luck, they relied on old novels like "The Biography of Ji Gong" and "Lu Sheng Dan," which they had read fluently, and shamelessly told stories on this cement sidewalk. They also wrote on the ground, "So-and-so is telling "The Biography of Ji Gong," etc." Each listener was charged one copper coin, which was not too expensive, and it was a unique way to make a living.</p>
<p>This street was very lively because it was where these artists were active. If you haven't had the chance to see it, you might as well go and observe it. Those who study sociology can get a lot of information there.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Xinquan)</p>
<p>Two farmers are preparing to plow their fields, hoping for heavy rains in the coming days. One is preparing to dry rice to make rice, hoping for several days of good sunshine. The weather under these circumstances, of course, makes one farmer happy and the other resentful. It is the same in life sometimes.</p>
<h3>The Faint Fragrance of Royal Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After we heard this, although we all knew that the Empress Dowager was speaking, especially the last sentence, which was absolutely contrary to the facts: but who would dare to openly refute her? The Empress Dowager herself had long expected that no one would dare to be so bold. However, her favorite servant, Li Lianying, had already made a look between his eyebrows, ready to speak for the Empress Dowager at any time. He had seen very little of the Xianfeng Emperor's affairs with his own eyes, and he knew that Xianfeng was not a wise monarch; however, in order to ingratiate himself with the Empress Dowager, he deliberately pretended to be always on the Empress Dowager's side, and if any of us dared to challenge her, he would definitely deny the facts and support the Empress Dowager to the end. But fortunately! None of us were brave enough, and no one dared to say a word in the end, so Li Lianying's loyal heart had no way to express itself, which was very disappointing for him.</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager made this forced explanation, the melancholy and depression in her heart seemed to have dissipated by half. Unexpectedly, such self-deceptive words can sometimes give oneself some comfort. She turned back again and looked at the few relics, as if she felt satisfied: then she slowly raised her head, with a kind of pitiable arrogance, and gave me a faint smile. Her meaning seemed to be:</p>
<p>[Don't look at his relics being so few, he was still an emperor in his lifetime!] In this way, we left this main hall, turned a corner, and walked into a main hall in the same palace courtyard; the Empress Dowager was still leading the way in front, but we all knew where she was going now, so we were even more cautious and absolutely didn't say a word. It turned out that we were now going to the place where the Tongzhi Emperor's relics were stored! (197)</p>
<h3>The Wild Monk</h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>On the west side of Rotten Flagpole Bridge stands a dilapidated temple that has been forgotten by people. The temple's incense has long been extinguished; the [resident monk] also disappeared many years ago. Therefore, it has become a place for wandering monks to rest temporarily.</p>
<p>Since autumn began, more than ten monks have been staying overnight in that dilapidated temple. Their daily lives are a dual personality. If you don't believe it, listen to me tell you:</p>
<p>These many monks, during the day, disperse into various villages. Each of their costumes has a commonality: on their backs they all have a [Weituo] pasted, this [Weituo] is installed in a wooden frame; on the frame are also inserted three sticks of incense; on their chests they all hang a large wooden fish. When they arrive in front of each family's door, they immediately kneel on the ground, then raise the wooden mallet, knock out [peeling peeling] sounds, while muttering sutras in their mouths; and also kowtow three times. Then they move to another house, performing the same [pathetic show].</p>
<p>After three or four days, they take advantage of their [lack of fate] to go to the homes they had chanted in front of, claiming to be from [Hangzhou] or [Putuo]; and saying that a certain temple there had [collapsed walls], or that a bridge there had [been in disrepair for years], so they came specifically to solicit donations to rebuild the temple and repair the bridge.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, the people in the countryside all believe in [gods and Buddhas], so they believe without doubt, and donate according to their ability.</p>
<p>After they collect the money, they buy some white wine and fresh meat in the nearby town. Then, the dilapidated temple suddenly becomes lively, everyone eating and drinking, enjoying themselves like they are bewitched. Really, sometimes they even play gambling games!</p>

<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Tonics</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>In this year of drought, the countryside is declaring bankruptcy, and in the cities, all industries are declining, presenting a desolate scene. Lively streets often have vacant shops. In this recession, even white rice is becoming a problem. What spare money is there to study tonics? However, strolling through the streets and alleys, wooden boxes of XX Ranch Consumptive Milk can be seen everywhere, and soy milk and cod liver oil are also experiencing a surge in sales. [Poor, poor, poor, still have three loads of copper]; moreover, our country is vast and rich in resources; [only with a healthy body can one do healthy things], the season is turning to winter, and there are many weak people who need to take some tonics to restore their health!</p>
<p>Zhu is just a poor scholar who, in this environment of rice as precious as pearls and firewood as expensive as cinnamon, relies on a worn-out pen to maintain the life of a poor couple, and is indeed stretched thin and in dire straits! However, due to several illnesses and once coughing up blood, his weak body, due to the persuasion of relatives and friends and his wife's frugality, has also been taking tonics in this early winter season. This is truly a laughable and lamentable farce! But thanks to the benefits of this weak body, he has come to know a few tonics, and dares not keep them secret, writing them out for fellow sufferers to adopt.</p>
<p>The most economical and effective tonic is, of course, soy milk mixed with raw eggs. Soy milk is readily available for sale in tofu shops, three copper coins for a full bowl. Eggs cost sixty coppers per yuan, and eating four a day is only ten coppers. The monthly cost, combined, is only one dollar and thirty cents, but its tonic power is very effective. This is truly a tonic for the common people. A slightly more expensive tonic than soy milk and eggs is cod liver oil. The tonic power of pure cod liver oil is very great, and its value is also very low. Five pounds can be had for one dollar and fifty cents, with each pound costing only about thirty cents, which cannot be considered anything but an inexpensive tonic. However, the smell of pure cod liver oil is unusually fishy and foul, and people with poor appetites find it difficult to drink. Therefore, other tonics are added to the fish oil to eliminate the fishy smell: milk is added to fish liver oil, making it white, called [milky white cod liver oil]; malt extract is added, making it brown, called [malt extract cod liver oil]. These types of cod liver oil are readily available for sale in pharmacies, but they cost four or five times more than pure cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Milk is also a common tonic. The milk carried and delivered by farmers is very cheap, with half a pound in a bottle costing only about one dollar and forty cents per month. However, this type of milk is delivered directly by farmers, and whether it is mixed with soy milk and whether the disinfection is complete, makes those who value hygiene afraid to take it greedily and fearlessly.</p>
<p>In addition to milk, there are also two types of beef juice and chicken juice. These two types of tonics, because chicken juice costs twelve dollars a month, and beef juice is avoided by some weak people in Suzhou who abstain from eating it, have not seen strong sales. Recently in Suzhou, chickens cost four catties for one yuan, and a single chicken costs only about one thousand cash. Buying the chicken yourself and boiling it into chicken juice is half the price of buying it ready-made, and the juice is thicker and there is more water, and the chicken meat can still be used as a snack, which is much more economical.</p>
<p>Our country's tonics are truly numerous and expensive. Those ginseng, bird's nests, deer antlers, and turtle shells are not only expensive, but also difficult to take. The ordinary ones are still silver ears. Ordinary silver ears cost about four yuan per tael. Slightly swell the dried silver ears in water, add rock sugar, and simmer in water over low heat. The procedure is not very tedious, but the taste is very sweet and delicious. The taste of hasma is similar to that of silver ears, but when eating it, first soak the muscles of the hasma until they swell, and the blood vessels attached to the meat must be removed one by one with silver needles before cooking. Yellow lip maw is also a tonic comparable to ginseng; to eat it, first use a ring to make the huge fish maw into thin strips, soak them until they swell, and then simmer them with rice to make porridge, which has a slightly fishy taste. In addition, there are also shark fins, mutton cakes, etc. The methods of eating are mostly like cooking dishes, either boiled in plain water or braised in soy sauce, each according to their preference. When a person really reaches the point where medicine is ineffective, if tonics can really bring the dead back to life, then the lives of the poor will be even more worthless. As the saying goes: [Rice is nourishing and meat builds muscle], those hard-working laborers, their spirits are much stronger than those who take tonics every day!</p>

<h3>Written After the Closing of the Labor Exhibition by Huang Longxian</h3>
<p>The unprecedented and sensational National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Education Achievement Exhibition closed today. The preparation for the exhibition lasted several months. A total of 30 provinces and cities participated in the exhibition, with over 30,000 exhibits. The exhibition lasted for twelve days, and attracted tens of thousands of visitors. It was indeed a grand event. In recent years, there have been many exhibitions, such as individual art exhibitions of calligraphy, painting, seal engraving, and other arts, the West Lake Exposition, the National Railway Line Product Exhibition, the National Mining and Geological Exhibition, and the recently held National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Education Achievement Exhibition. Individual art exhibitions are private in nature, while expositions like the Mining Exhibition and Labor Exhibition are organized by the government. The motivations are different, and the purposes are naturally different. Among the latter four, the Exposition and the Railway Exhibition are somewhat similar in nature. The Mining Exhibition belongs to a specialized field, and is not fully understood by the general public. The Labor Exhibition, however, is entirely composed of school productions, and the producers are all young students. It is truly a pure and educational exhibition. The excellence of the exhibition's achievements has been widely praised by visitors and in newspaper articles, with few criticisms. I participated in the exhibition's preparation work and visited the exhibits from various provinces and cities four or five times. Now, I will briefly present my personal observations and future hopes for consideration by experts.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial No. 1 Middle School product (self-made exercise book)</p>
<p>(1) Personal Observations</p>
<p>A total of 29,705 exhibits were displayed in this exhibition (exhibits from the four northeastern provinces arrived after the opening, and the number was not included). Zhejiang Province had the most types of exhibits, with 37 types, followed by Shandong, with 36 types, then Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Qingdao, each with between 20 and 30 types. Ningxia, Qinghai, and Weihaiwei had the fewest, each with less than 10 types. Fujian Province had the most exhibits, with 3,213 pieces, followed by Zhejiang, with 2,694 pieces, then Shanghai and Qingdao, each with over 2,400 to over 2,600 pieces. Ningxia had the fewest, with 20 pieces. Looking at the number and types of achievements in this exhibition, one can get a glimpse of the state of labor education and vocational education development. At least, the number of types of achievements can indicate whether or not attention is being paid to labor education and vocational education, regardless of quality. In terms of quantity, there are also exceptions. For example, Guangdong Province is generally recognized as having a very developed secondary education, but only 140 items were sent to this exhibition, which is too few. Therefore, the exhibits in this exhibition do not seem to represent its overall achievements. In terms of schools participating in the exhibition, there are 266 vocational schools nationwide, and 169 participated, accounting for about 60 percent. There are 1,893 middle schools nationwide, and 337 participated, accounting for about 18 percent. There are 867 normal schools nationwide, and 139 participated, accounting for about 16 percent. There are 258,064 elementary schools nationwide, and 868 participated, accounting for about 0.3040 percent. This shows that the exhibits can only represent the overall achievements. This is probably inevitable due to practical difficulties.</p>
<p>In terms of schools, there are more exhibits from middle schools, normal schools, and elementary schools than from vocational schools. This is based on all exhibits. Separately, some provinces and cities have more elementary school exhibits than middle school, normal school, and vocational school exhibits, such as Shanghai and Nanjing. Some have more vocational school exhibits than primary and secondary schools, such as Hunan. Some have more middle school exhibits than vocational school and elementary school exhibits, such as Guangdong. In terms of the nature of the exhibits, industrial arts are the most common, followed by home economics, and agricultural science is the least common. China is an agricultural country, but agricultural achievements are so few, which is truly regrettable. Rice, wheat, silk, and tea are the major agricultural products of our country, but tea was not seen at all in this exhibition, which is a pity. In terms of the categories of exhibits, handicrafts are more common than mechanical industries, and decorations are more common than practical items. While it is necessary to promote and improve handicrafts today, large-scale production depends on mechanical industries. Decorations are needed in life, but they are not essential. We cannot but pay attention to this. The most praised exhibits include Hunan's embroidery, Fujian's lacquerware, Jiangxi's porcelain, Jiangsu's glass and pottery, Shandong's stone carvings, military models from Shanghai, Zhejiang, Henan, and other provinces and cities, various design models from Shanghai, Nanjing, Fujian, and other provinces and cities, teaching aids from Hebei and Fujian, machinery and woodworking products from the China Vocational School, applied chemistry and textile works from the vocational school attached to Hebei Institute of Technology and Hunan Advanced Industrial School, and spinning machines from the Ping City Han's Women's Vocational Supplementary School. Some are known for their special products, some for their creativity, some for their practicality, and some for their exquisiteness. They are truly excellent works that leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>The exhibits in this exhibition were dazzling and beautiful. Most of the works were newly made, except for a few old ones. This is generally recognized by visitors. Minister Wang's "Purpose of the Labor Exhibition" on the overview of the National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Education Achievement Exhibition stated that the first condition for the exhibits was that they "can represent the usual general achievements, and not be specially made for the occasion." However, in our opinion, there are many that meet this condition, but it is difficult to guarantee that there are no items made specially for the occasion. What is meant by representing the usual general achievements refers to the labor achievements of students during normal teaching. If the purpose is only for the exhibition and the work is rushed and specially made, it loses the meaning of education and the original intention of labor.</p>
<p>This Labor Exhibition shows the achievements of the exhibits, not the achievements of the entire labor education. It can be said to be an exhibition of labor works, but not an exhibition of the entire labor education achievements. This is because not all labor education achievements can be shown by exhibits. For example, the classroom cleaning, arrangement, management, and decoration of school affairs work in the elementary school curriculum standards, the division of labor, management, design, decoration, and repair of school buildings, school grounds, and teaching aids, the investigation of objects in home affairs work, the investigation of the lives of farmers in agricultural work, and the investigation of the lives of workers in handicraft work can only be shown in words or reports, and there are no concrete works like woodworking and bamboo work. Also, such as the sowing, transplanting, cultivation, weeding, fertilization, pest control, and harvesting of agriculture in the middle school curriculum standards, and the home care and child rearing in home affairs, there are no concrete objects to show their achievements, and they cannot all be sent to the venue. Therefore, this exhibition is an exhibition of labor works, not an exhibition of the entire labor education achievements. After visiting, we can only say how the labor works of a certain school are, or how the labor works of a certain province are. It is not reasonable to use this to precisely evaluate the entire labor education achievements.</p>
<p>The schools participating in this exhibition are vocational schools, middle schools, normal schools, and elementary schools, which are all within the scope of general education and do not involve higher education. In my personal opinion, vocational education and labor education are not limited to one stage of general education. The entire school system should be labor-oriented and production-oriented. The labor education theorist Blonsky said, "Industrial education is the highest labor education." We can see from his words that vocational education is not limited to vocational schools, and labor education is not limited to primary and secondary schools. Agricultural and industrial sciences in colleges and universities can also be included in the scope of vocational education and labor education. In recent years, the central government has restricted liberal arts and promoted practical sciences, with the aim of creating practical talents to meet the needs of the country and society. The so-called practical science education is advanced vocational education and advanced labor education. If the practical science products of colleges and universities are displayed together, so that visitors can have a comprehensive concept and comparison of the production operations of schools at all levels, it would be more meaningful and valuable than this exhibition.</p>
<p>(2) Future Hopes</p>
<p>The lack of machine products and agricultural products in this Labor Exhibition has been briefly described above. Local traditional handicrafts must be improved, and machine production is even more urgent today. Handicraft industries require large costs and slow production, while machine production is the opposite. At a time when foreign goods are pouring in and increasing, large-scale machine production is needed to save the situation. Agricultural production is related to the foundation of the country. In recent years, governments at all levels have spared no effort in promoting it, and social figures have also regarded it as the key to rural revitalization. However, the agricultural products displayed in this Labor Exhibition were very few. Even in these few exhibits, there was no special progress. In the future, industrial vocational schools should move from handicrafts to focus on machine industries, especially improving local specialties with machine production. Agricultural vocational schools should pay attention to the improvement of agricultural technology and products, especially using scientific methods to improve local native products, as the basis for rural revitalization.</p>
<p>In the past, vocational schools mostly relied on book lectures, or lacked sufficient equipment due to economic reasons. Those who set up industrial arts lacked complete factories, and those who set up agricultural sciences lacked large farms, so that students only had brain training and lacked hand training. Even with considerable equipment, the actual operation was done by workers, which had the same drawbacks as the lack of practice venues. In the future, vocational schools must strive to enrich equipment, so that students' hand training is more than brain training, or at least the time for hand and brain training should be equal. The practice method must be like workers in factories and farmers in farms. All hard work must be done by themselves and not by others. In this way, the knowledge and experience gained by students will not be empty.</p>
<p>Labor education is a new product, and its meaning is broader than the handicrafts and crafts of the past. The handicrafts and crafts of the past cannot embrace today's labor education, but today's labor education can include the handicrafts or crafts of the past. The scope of labor education is broader, so its implementation method is also more difficult. The goal of labor education should be to cultivate children's creative abilities first and foremost, and to express their free will in labor operations. Schools should have sufficient labor equipment, such as factories, farms, and home economics practice venues, so that children can choose their own work, plan themselves, and create themselves, without being restricted by a fixed method. All labor operations in the school life environment can be used to implement labor education. If we only rely on a few hours of labor teaching, I am afraid that the goals stipulated in the curriculum standards cannot be fully achieved. Therefore, labor teaching should be linked to various subjects, so as to cultivate children's labor skills through the practice of various production labor, and establish the true meaning of labor education.</p>
<h3>Qi University Students Petition Han</h3>
<p>▲ Request Publication of Board Resolutions</p>
<p>(Jinan Express) The dispute at Shandong Qilu University has been completely resolved regarding the president's question after three days of board meetings since the 5th. During the transition period, Vice Chairman Li Zhifan will temporarily represent the president. However, the students requested that the board resolutions not be published and circulated because there were rumors that were not conducive to the College of Arts and Sciences. Therefore, at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th, the Qi University Student Union held a meeting to discuss requesting the board of directors to publish the board meeting minutes and explain certain rumors. Student representatives are now waiting for the new president to arrive and sent representatives to the provincial government to meet with Chairman Han to petition at 5:00 p.m. on the 9th, requesting the authorities to order the board of directors to publish the board meeting minutes. Because it was Sunday, Han was not at the provincial government, so they did not see him. They only left the petition for Han to review. In addition, the Qi University Student Self-Government Executive Committee decided to send another telegram to Kong Xiangxi within days requesting that Kong continue to serve as chairman because Chairman Kong Xiangxi's telegram only allowed assistance from the side, and to provide assistance with strength.</p>
<h3>Anhui Education Department's Major Movement to Rescue Local Education Funds</h3>
<p>▲ Contacting Nine Provinces Including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shandong to Strive for Central Support</p>
<p>The Anhui Education Department believes that the central government's order to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees has reduced nearly half of Anhui Province's 2.4 million yuan in local education funds, and the number of out-of-school children will increase by 90,000. It has submitted a request to the provincial government to forward it to the Executive Yuan for relief. The Executive Yuan has not yet approved it. The Education Department believes that this situation is not limited to Anhui Province, and has sent letters to the education departments of nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Hebei, Hubei, and Henan, requesting that they unite and strive for central support. There are three items for rescue: 1. The Ministry of Finance should promptly allocate funds to compensate for the reduced local education funds in various provinces, counties, and cities due to the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees. 2. The abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees related to education funds that are limited in time should be postponed until a compensation method is found. In the future, a certain amount of compensation must be made before a certain amount of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous fees can be reduced. 3. The central government should issue an order to various provinces to levy income tax, inheritance tax, luxury donation, and superstition donation, and designate these four taxes as special funds for local education fees in cities and counties. Nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, have successively replied in agreement. The Anhui Education Department is now drafting a document to be sent to various provinces for review. Once they receive a reply, it will be sent to the ministry.</p>
<p>This City's National Military Training Association</p>
<h3>Intensifying Student Military Training</h3>
<p>▲ Schools Have Started Shooting Training</p>
<p>▲ Large-Scale General Review to be Held Next Spring</p>
<p>▲ Centralized Training is Being Actively Prepared</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Military Training Committee of this city has strictly implemented military training for students, and has achieved considerable results. Chief Pan of the Training Headquarters came to Shanghai to inspect the schools, and was satisfied with the results of each school. The committee is now stepping up its work, strictly training, and plans to hold a large-scale general review of the city next spring. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Schools Start Shooting Training Military training students in the second grade of high school and above have started shooting training at various schools, including Jiaotong University and Nanyang Middle School. The shooting order is divided into three steps: blank shooting, reduced-load shooting, and live ammunition shooting. The current start is blank shooting. Reduced-load shooting will also be held within the month. The shooting location is within each school. President Li of Jiaotong University also plans to purchase a large number of military equipment to strictly implement student military training.</p>
<p>▲ City-Wide Review to be Held Next Spring This city's student military general review was held once this spring at Longhua Airport, and the results were very good. In order to assess the military training results of various schools over the past year, the committee plans to hold a large-scale city-wide military training student spring general review next spring, and invites members of the Training Headquarters, as well as Mayor Wu and Director Pan of this city, to come to the venue for review. All plans have been prepared. The number of schools implementing military training this year has doubled compared to the previous year. The grand occasion will be unmatched in the past.</p>
<p>▲ Centralized Military Training Plan is Ready The centralized military training, which will be held for three months from April to July next year, is now ready. The location is decided to be the Shanghai Racecourse, and the municipal government is requested to contact the racecourse. The number of people in the centralized military training is about 4,700, organized into a general team, with five major teams, each major team with five squadrons, and each squadron with three platoons. The platoon below is a class. All team leader candidates will be submitted by the committee to the Training Headquarters for appointment. This centralized training is only for military training students in high schools and equivalent schools, and there will be no summer training. For colleges and universities, there is no centralized training, and there will still be summer training next year.</p>
<p>▲ Summer Training Students Must Submit Photos In addition, the committee issued team certificates to military training students from various schools who participated in summer training this year. However, a small number of students from each school have not yet submitted photos, and they should submit photos as soon as possible in order to receive the team certificate. Students with team certificates will enjoy the preferential treatment of reduced time when participating in centralized training next year. Students without team certificates must make up for summer training.</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<p>The hope of West Qing basketball is weak again</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Loses to Jinan</h3>
<p>35 vs 28, a difference of 7 points</p>
<p>Jinan Wins with More Accurate Basket Shots</p>
<p>Last night's basketball match between Jinan and Jiangwan at Xiqing was of great significance to Jiangwan. Jiangwan's basketball skills have seen significant improvement, and they hadn't lost a single game in this tournament, giving them a good chance of winning the Xiqing championship. Jinan's skills have also improved, but they had already been defeated by Xiqing. If Jiangwan had passed this hurdle, they would have faced Xiqing's Ma Ling in a contest for the championship. However, as a result of last night's fierce battle, Jiangwan was defeated by Jinan with a score of 35 to 28. This has dimmed Jiangwan's hopes in Xiqing, which inevitably disappointed and frustrated the hundreds of Fudan cheering fans last night.</p>
<p>▲ Skill Levels  In terms of skill, the two teams were evenly matched. Jinan's teamwork was not as refined as Jiangwan's, but Jiangwan ultimately suffered a setback because their movements were too slow, giving the opponents a chance to defend. In the first half, Jiangwan repeatedly pressed forward but found it difficult to enter the basket, which was due to this reason. In terms of shooting accuracy, Jinan was superior to Jiangwan, and this was the key to Jinan's victory. If Jinan can further study their teamwork and offensive tactics, they will be a promising team. Last night, Wang Nanzhen, the Jinan defender, was particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>▲ Tense Situation  The tension of the game was unparalleled. Jinan took the lead with three points, and Jiangwan equalized in a difficult situation. Both sides played very tight and cautious defense, making it difficult to score. After 8-8, Jiangwan scored three consecutive points, gradually taking the lead at 15-10, drawing loud cheers. However, the Jinan players did not show any weakness, and the first half ended in a 15-15 tie. In the second half, Jiangwan switched to a slow-paced attack, allowing Jinan to take advantage and surge ahead, surpassing them at 23-18. From then on, Jiangwan was always behind and could not catch up. The score progressed to 28-20, then 31-22, and the final result was 35-28. ▲Jinan Free Throws Fouls ▲Jiangwan Free Throws Fouls</p>

<p>Women's Basketball Game</p>
<h3>Huadong Defeats National School of Commerce</h3>
<p>▲Result: 49 to 13</p>
<p>The National School of Commerce women's basketball team, the champion team of the Independent Colleges, met the Huadong team at the Huadong field yesterday. The referee was Xia Kaiming. At the start of the game, the Huadong forwards were very active. Zhang Sumei scored three consecutive goals, giving them an absolute advantage. The School of Commerce had to suspend the game temporarily to discuss tactics. As expected, there were gradual improvements. Zhang Meiyun made a successful shot, but the Huadong defenders were tight, leaving the School of Commerce no chance to take advantage. On the other hand, the Huadong forwards worked well together, and Zhang Sumei scored again and again. The result of the first quarter was 19-5, with Huadong leading. In the second quarter, the School of Commerce, seeing the many points lost in the first quarter, launched a vigorous counterattack. Therefore, the Huadong forwards did not make much progress either. Each team scored four points. The result of the first half was 23-9, with Huadong winning. As the game resumed, Huadong, riding the momentum of their victory, Shen Yan, Fa Baozhen, and others made quick passes and showed their sharp edge, scoring continuously. Although the School of Commerce tried their best to defend, they were unable to do so, and they ended the third quarter with 2-8. In the fourth quarter, Huadong, confident of victory, made a major adjustment to their lineup, bringing in fresh troops. The School of Commerce took the opportunity to rise up, but because they were eager to win, their shots were difficult to make, and they lost again with 2-18. The overall result was 49-13, a big victory for Huadong.</p>

<h3>Thoughts in Literature</h3>
<p>— Shen Du</p>
<p>Among the elements of literature, thought is one of them.</p>
<p>[Without thought content, artistic works cannot exist. Even works where the writer only respects form and does not care about content ultimately express some kind of definite thought.]</p>
<p>This sentence means that without thought, a work of art cannot become a work of art. Because thought is the author's view of life. Whether the view of life is explicit or implicit, it will inevitably be reflected in his work. This is because the view of life is none other than the author's personality or individuality. The author's social status will inevitably reflect his thoughts in his works, intentionally or unintentionally. Someone warns: [You cannot create in order to embody a certain kindness or to promote a certain thought, or to appreciate current works based on a certain thought!] The meaning of this warning is good, but in practice it has little meaning, because even if you want to avoid creating for some thought, your society will teach you to reflect it without resistance, and your thought has already been determined by the existence of your society. We should understand: [Poets, like ordinary people, even their thoughts and feelings are products of society.] Naturally, a literary artist is the same. The most important thing is not that creating to embody a certain thought or to promote a certain thought will lose its artistic value, but in the degree of authenticity expressed in the work. The closer it is to objective reality, the higher the artistic evaluation. So in this sense, although Balzac intentionally was an ardent supporter of the propertied society, he is still a great artist, precisely because his creation fully expressed the objective reality of the time. Similarly, we do not criticize Tolstoy. Although he was a writer of Christian thought, he is worthy of respect for expressing the reality of society.</p>
<p>However, [When the author describes thoughts, he must melt the thoughts into the crucible of emotion to describe them.] This is indeed a golden saying, because artists express their thoughts through images. If the author does not write through images but through theoretical proof, it will not become a work of art.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The sky is her house, the earth is her bed, and the world is her home.</p>
<p>Her daughter is only four years old, but in her mother's arms, she has traveled to many places, tasted a lot of hardship, and come to know this turbid world.</p>
<p>The mother and daughter are a pair of wanderers, drifting from east to west, from north to south.</p>
<p>It's getting late. Perhaps the sun has not yet set on the western horizon, but the towering buildings of the city do obscure its light. At the same time, the bright electric lights on both sides of the street are flickering their eyes.</p>
<p>In short, another day has passed. Wanderers do not need to spend their energy calculating the days. They live one day at a time, and when twelve months pass, they add a year to their age. Wanderers' energy is only used on how not to go hungry, or how to make the hunger last a little longer.</p>
<p>However, as it got late, her stomach was indeed rumbling. At first, she could barely support herself and resist the emptiness in her stomach, but after a while, she couldn't do it at all. She just felt very weak, her hands had no strength, and as for her legs, moving them felt like they weighed at least a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>This was still bearable. She was an adult, and she knew that she was poor, that she was something worse than even a stray dog. But the child's appetite, once it surged up, had to be dealt with somehow.</p>
<p>In fact, the child had been calling her for quite a while, still mumbling:</p>
<p>[Mom, I want to eat. I, I'm hungry, my tummy's hot.]</p>
<p>What could she do about hunger? Her mother wasn't a rich person.</p>
<p>Holding the child, she sat down in a quiet place next to the mouth of the alley.</p>
<p>This big bed was cold. The wandering woman couldn't help but think that autumn had arrived. In the summer, the ground was as hot as fire.</p>
<p>She just wanted to sit down, stop the churning of her stomach, and also try to divert the child's demands with this action. What a stupid move! The child's hunger could not be masked with a single action. The child mumbled again:</p>
<p>[Mom, I want to eat. I, I'm hungry, my tummy's hot.]</p>
<p>This time, it seemed impossible not to answer. She repeated her usual words:</p>
<p>[Xiaochun, my good child, we'll go beg in a little while. Can you rest for a moment?]</p>
<p>Her tone was calm, and then, according to the old habit, she kissed the child's dirty little face hard a few times.</p>
<p>But, thinking about it, this child itself was such an inauspicious being. In between these ardent kisses, when she saw the child's eyes, which resembled her father's, she thought of her father.</p>
<p>The child's father was a good father, but he didn't have the destiny to be extravagant. It was really a coincidence that when the child was born into the world, it was the moment he left the world. So we should say that he didn't have the destiny to be a father, or rather, that the child was unlucky.</p>
<p>Therefore, she immediately felt a little disgust for the child in front of her.</p>
<p>This father's death was truly strange. He was fishing in the river, and on a clear day, suddenly wind and clouds rose up. When the raindrops fell, his fishing boat capsized into the water. Debts that he could never repay in his lifetime, those debts were like the net he used to fish, the net threads stubbornly dragging him into the river.</p>
<p>But even in his death, he had not finished paying off his debts. All the rotten things in the house went to the creditors, and she followed closely behind, leaving that desolate house. Thus, the mother and daughter became wanderers, becoming people with the four seas as their home.</p>
<p>An old woman selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, carrying a basket, walked slowly from afar, her selling voice unusually short. In fact, it could be said that she didn't want to open her throat, just like a comfortable and well-fed old woman didn't want to move her legs.</p>
<p>[Mom, the sesame cake and fried dough stick seller is here.]</p>
<p>The child shouted spontaneously, waving her hand, her eyes almost flying into the sky. The mother's heart was seized with anxiety. How could she now cover up the fact that she was deceiving the child? A hungry child absolutely would not easily give up the food in front of her eyes. As she was thinking, the child shouted again urgently:</p>
<p>[Mom, the sesame cake and fried dough stick seller is here.]</p>
<p>[Mom knows.]</p>
<p>Smiling, she reached into the pocket of her torn clothes, feeling clearly that there were still six copper coins. Six copper coins were more precious than six dollars to others. How many good words had she said, how many times had she called out to 'Sir', how many times had she knocked her head on the cement ground? Six copper coins that she had only earned today were not copper coins, they were simply gold, not sweat and blood! Was she really going to spend these six copper coins? No, spending them wouldn't fill her stomach. How could a fly swallowed into a tiger's stomach save it from hunger!</p>
<p>The old woman had already heard the child's second shout to her mother, so she walked forward. She didn't shy away from the mother and daughter's status, because in fact, most of her customers were people with tattered clothes, and at most, they were people who couldn't afford transactions of more than ten copper coins.</p>
<p>The electric lights seemed even brighter, which meant that it was getting darker everywhere. Now, it was dark.</p>
<h3>Not a Fierce Dog</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>For Three Years</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>For three years, I have been pacing on this endless wandering line, pacing, pacing across the green-edged sea, across the hungry-woven countryside, across the dark hell.  A full three years of precious days have been wasted in wandering!  Now I always sigh faintly!  Life can age a young person, and so can wandering.  For three years, I don't know how much turbulence and struggle I have gone through: the pain of hunger, the pain of loneliness, the pain of illness, the pain of love, the pain of insomnia... I have experienced them all.  I don't know about people's memories.  My own memories are more painful than joyful.  People say I'm old, yes, I feel that way too.</p>
<p>I say, this is a year of wandering, and also a year of hunger. How many people flowed out from the hungry countryside, and how many people flowed out from the unevenly fat and thin big cities, but flowing in and out still empty stomachs, carrying disappointment and resentment. Like me, I have flowed for three full years, and am I not carrying this disappointed heart?  Sometimes it feels very difficult to get through a day, but these three long years seem to have slipped away in an instant.</p>
<p>Thinking back on the changes in my life during these three years, sometimes I can't even believe it myself. I once lived in a world without sun for several months, eating cold rice, sleeping on the floor, listening to the moans of the sick, and watching the hideous smiles of the jailers. At night, everyone was telling their sad fate. I also wore a slanted leather belt in the gray crowd, fought battles, and saw countless dead people, corpses, and purple blood. A iron bird dropped a pile of shit and destroyed the lives of dozens of people. I have also seen it. I am not a hard-hearted person, but at that time seeing one or several dead people felt like seeing a few frogs dying on the edge of the field. Later, I hid under the wings of a peach-colored loving goddess for a while, but soon I was determined to jump out. I felt that it was not bad for young people to have this kind of life, but it was impossible to hide for a long time, so I estranged her again and embarked on the journey again. I have deeply experienced the taste of other painful things such as illness, hunger, loneliness, and insomnia, but these situations cannot be described in detail in this short article.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Until recently, my wandering life seems to have come to a small end, and by chance I came to another country to study. A person's life is really unpredictable. Sometimes it feels a bit like a dream, even I can't predict it. This time, my coming east is like this. Is it lucky? No, it cannot be said that way. Maybe there are more tragic situations waiting for me in the future. Who knows what will happen in the future? But at the moment, thinking of the bloodstains of struggling over the past few years, and now having the opportunity to relive this student life, when I walk through that narrow path full of red leaves to school every day with my schoolbag, I always feel infinitely happy!</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 1934</p>
<h3>From Hekou to Lao Cai</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Stepping off the train with luggage in hand, weary from a sleepless night, we tentatively set foot on the soil of Hekou, feeling somewhat lost!</p>
<p>Is Hekou really like this? Such a dilapidated and somewhat decadent small town, with a sparse population, only one relatively bustling street. Alongside the street stood a few huge, lush green trees. Walking on this street under the scorching sun felt strangely cool; however, a foul, miasmic odor constantly assaulted our senses, seeming like the fragrance of the trees' flowers, yet also like the stench of feces from a toilet. This smell truly made us feel somewhat afraid upon inhaling it!</p>
<p>Following the clerk from the shop, we arrived at the Hekou Superintendent's Inspection Office. First, we had our exit passports inspected. The inspector, like a teacher in school quizzing students, asked us about our hometowns and what we were doing in the provinces. Then, with an arrogant tone, he said:</p>
<p>"Alright, since that's the case, we won't make things difficult for you. Otherwise, all travelers to Hekou would have to be detained in Hekou for a day, waiting for a slow inspection before being allowed to go to Lao Cai the next day! You're getting special treatment."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he looked at us with cunning eyes, as if expecting some reward from us. However, we only offered a grateful smile, collected our belongings, and hurried away.</p>
<p>The weather in Hekou was unexpectedly so hot; after walking around the street, we were drenched in sweat, our sweat-soaked shirts sticking uncomfortably to our backs. That foul, miasmic odor kept assailing us, making us reluctant to linger any longer. With a mix of apprehension and excitement, we stepped onto the iron bridge, more than forty feet long, leading to a foreign land, without any reluctance to leave Yunnan, and headed towards Lao Cai, which radiated the majesty of imperialism.</p>
<p>Lao Cai, this town squatting beside the Red River, watching Hekou with a predator's gaze, doesn't seem to have a larger population than Hekou. The street is just as singular. Here, besides the shops mostly run by our countrymen from Guangdong, there are also many gambling stalls.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen gambling dens, with dark crowds surrounding them, gambling on the streets day and night. Because of the hot weather, a grass mat was hung over the gambling area as a substitute for an electric fan, with someone specifically pulling it to generate refreshing breezes.</p>
<p>Next to the gambling dens were opera performances that could be watched without charge. The actors were all dressed strangely, performing what seemed to be Vietnamese plays. Their acting was so humorous that it was truly laughable!</p>
<p>This entertainment was entirely set up for the gamblers. Those who gambled spent their days with their heads down, immersed in the act, without any inclination to look up and watch. Therefore, the performances were treated like children playing around, with the players haphazardly going through the motions.</p>
<p>As soon as we set foot on this foreign land, a burly Vietnamese soldier stood at the end of the bridge, casting a foreign gaze at us, which made us feel somewhat fearful. We knew that inspections here were very strict. It was said that not only those carrying opium would be arrested and thrown into a water prison, but even those carrying matches would be severely punished. These rumors had made us somewhat afraid in the past, and now, stepping onto this foreign soil, our hearts couldn't help but beat faster.</p>
<p>Not far from the bridge, directly across the street, was a small Western-style house. Inside sat a Frenchman, resembling a judge, whose demeanor was so dignified that people dared not look him directly in the eye. The clerk guided us here, where we underwent a rigorous inspection (fortunately, we weren't carrying anything prohibited, thank God!). After our passports were checked, we were finally able to return to the shop in peace.</p>
<p>The weather was truly hot, and even drinking water constantly didn't quench our thirst. In the evening, when the weather cooled down a bit, three young men, draped in clothes, ran to the iron bridge shrouded in the night, bathed in the cool river breeze, listening to the sound of the Red River roaring, as if crying out for the injustices suffered by the Vietnamese people. At that moment, we felt a sense of sorrow for this foreign land.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (10)(4)</h3>
<p>— (Josephcornad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>"Hey, Dad, let me in. It's Harry, it's really me! I've only come home for a [very short time]."</p>
<p>One of the windows upstairs was opened.</p>
<p>"It's a prank, you messenger," Old Haggett's voice said from the darkness above. "You have nothing to do with him. This will ruin everything."</p>
<p>She heard Harry Haggett say, "Hello, Dad," followed by a "clang." The window slammed shut, and he stood before her again.</p>
<p>"Dad is still the same. He used to forbid me from running away, almost whipping me to death. Now that I'm back, he's trying to throw a shovel at my head to stop me from entering. The shovel grazed my shoulder blade."</p>
<p>She shuddered.</p>
<p>"I don't care," you began to say, "but I spent the last of my money on the train ticket, the last two pence on grooming! Out of respect for the old man."</p>
<p>"Are you really Harry Haggett?" she asked quickly. "Can you prove it?"</p>
<p>"Can I prove it? Who else could prove it?" he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Prove it with what? Why should I need to prove it? Except for England, perhaps nowhere else in the world could you find a man, or especially a woman, who remembers that I'm Harry Haggett. I might resemble Harry Haggett more than anyone alive; I can prove everything in a minute if you let me into your house."</p>
<p>"Come in," she said.</p>
<p>He then walked into the front garden of Garvell's house. His tall shadow strode forward, and she waited with her back to the window, watching the figure. In that figure, only the sound of approaching footsteps seemed the most real. Light shone on the wide-brimmed hat; a strong shoulder appeared, seeming to cut through the darkness; a foot stepped forward. He turned around and stood still, facing the window of the parlor, which reflected light behind her, turning his head left and right, smiling softly to himself.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Selling Pressure Overwhelms the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Catastrophic Drop of Eight Yuan, Breaching the 70 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to be engulfed by selling pressure, with buyers finding it difficult to resist. Sassoon Bank aggressively dumped huge amounts of foreign exchange, causing domestic bank rates to loosen repeatedly. Due to worsening news, even though major players tried hard to maintain it, the 70 Yuan barrier ultimately couldn't be held. Early morning trading opened with overseas silver markets showing a slight contraction in London and stability in the U.S., while forward silver prices contracted, and exchange rates had already begun to rise. London spot gold fell three and a half pence. Outside the market, pre-market trading opened and immediately rose to 78.79 Yuan. However, because major players were firm after the close due to U.S. buying, and despite an increase in margin to 30,000 lots, the major short-sellers aggressively added to their positions, making it clear that the longs were in a difficult position to resist. The difference was too great, and optimism was hard to maintain, resulting in a reversal. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with stability for British Pound and an increase of 0.0625 for U.S. Dollar. Customs Gold Unit fell by 5 cents, and the standard price for gold was lowered to 1,010.8 Yuan. The morning opened even lower. Although there was a rebound after the opening, the market weakened again as Sassoon continued to dump Sterling, and exchange rates loosened further. Even with major players attempting to maintain it, there was only a slight rally. It was known that HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with an increase of 0.125 for British Pound and 0.3125 for U.S. Dollar. Thereafter, the decline accelerated. However, banks took advantage of the low prices to buy back positions, and major players also maintained their positions at the lows, leading to a prolonged struggle. But because the selling pressure had not been fully exhausted, supply still exceeded demand, and buyers were helpless, ultimately breaking the 70 Yuan barrier. Buyers then became active, and a rebound soon followed. The announcement of the silver equalization tax revealed that it was still 6.75%, with the British Pound calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 5625. Confidence gradually stabilized, and the market gradually became more stable. However, because Sassoon was still dumping U.S. dollars, taking advantage of the high prices to offer more supply, there was much consolidation despite the rise. Later, HSBC and Bank of Communications successively bought back Sterling, stabilizing the exchange market. At noon, there was a rebound, but the afternoon closing price still showed fluctuation. The market was still good in the afternoon because of rumors that the Central Bank had purchased more than 2,000 lots in the morning. Sassoon immediately dumped U.S. dollars, and the rise suffered another setback. Indian silver shrank slightly, and major players took the opportunity to buy aggressively, leading to another rebound. However, as Sassoon continued to dump Sterling, confidence remained weak, and a renewed decline began. However, major players bought aggressively at the lows, so the decline and rebound were both rapid. The overall trend fluctuated, with intense competition in the middle. Finally, with the rumor of a huge telegraphic transfer loan, selling pressure resumed, and the 70 Yuan barrier ultimately could not be held. With tight money market conditions and extreme difficulty in obtaining spot collateral, the major players who had aggressively purchased spot goods in the past sold them all off. The enormous short positions increased further. In addition, rumors of possible changes in the financial situation, which could influence the possibility of a huge loan, added to the behind-the-scenes reasons, and confidence naturally collapsed. The market conditions for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 977 Yuan, a slight setback of 2 jiao compared to the previous close. It then went to 7.4 jiao. Dada Chengfuxing Yongjin gained to 8.7 jiao. Sassoon wanted to dump Sterling but failed, and it was difficult to rise further. Then Sassoon sold 1875 and 25 of March Sterling to HSBC, and 34 yuan of January US dollars could be closed, resulting in a decline to 5.5 jiao from Da Fa, Yonghengxing, Hengyu Yuanheng and other sales. Fuyu Shengda, Hengyufu Changda, Fa Yongqing, Yudingkang, and others sold again, so although there was a struggle, the decline was unstoppable. HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with an increase of 0.125 for British Pound and 0.3125 for U.S. Dollar. The exchange market loosened, and it fell even further to 3.5 jiao. Although Qian Changxiang Hengyu went in, the rebound was minimal. Suddenly, Hengyu Huixiang Da Fa Yongfu Yu Hengxing and other companies supplied lots, and it fell again to 2 jiao. McCallum bought 9375 of February U.S. dollars, and Hengchang Yongfu Xingyong Shangna, still very maintained at this time, rising up and down quite frequently. Hengyu Fuyu Yongde Zhaofeng Chang Zailai sold, and the floaters also cut losses. At the same time, retail investors strongly shorted, and it fell from 3 yuan to 69.5 yuan. Yuan Mao, Yongyi Chengzheng Changjiatai Hengtai Shengda Hengxing Dingtai Yifeng Yong and other companies successively purchased lots. The silver equalization tax was announced, and the market stabilized, gradually rising to 73.8 jiao. Sassoon sold 34.25 of January U.S. dollars to Citibank, and Yuan Yi Dada Cheng sold off, retreated to 2.9 jiao. Qian Changxiang was still buying, Fuxing Yong then bought and resold. It felt very dazed at this time, first rising to 30.9 jiao and then retreating to 2.5 jiao. Huabi bought 3125 of March Sterling and stabilized because the market was very wary of central bank purchases. Subsequently, Zhentai Yuan Mao Yongfu Yu Hengxing Yuan and others made slight gains, rising to 4.8 jiao. HSBC wanted to buy 625 of January Sterling as well, Hengxing Qian Changxiang Dalian Bang Tongtai Chang took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and it retreated to 1.7 jiao. Then Bank of Communications bought 375 of February Sterling, and Yuqing Yong Fuxing Yong Yifeng Yong Dingchang Yuansheng Yongfu Yuqing Yu and others bought together and rose to 6.5 jiao. Did Zhentai Qian Changxiang Dada Cheng take advantage of the high prices to sell off, and it fell to 4.8 jiao. Fuxing Yong Shangna, the noon closing price was 975 yuan, and the market weakened slightly after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 975.3 yuan, Fu An and Dalian Bang sold off lots, retreating to 4.1 jiao. Tongfu Fuxing Yong Dada Cheng Natiao, then rose to 5.5 jiao. Sassoon sold 875 of February U.S. dollars to Zhenjin, and Yuan Mao Yongxiang Fengqing Yu and other companies sold off lots, and it fell to 3.1 jiao. The news of a small Indian silver of 1.1 anna and no movement, Changda Dada Cheng Fuxing Yong Fuchang entered to 5 yuan, the British bought 25 of January U.S. dollars, and Yuan Yi took advantage of the high prices to sell off lots, retreating to 4 yuan. Sassoon still had a selling stomach, Fuxing Yong Da Fa Yong Tianfeng Yuankang Xiang and other companies sold off lots, and it fell to 1.3 jiao. Hengyu Dada Cheng entered lots and pulled up more than 1 yuan, Fuxing Yong Yuanchang Yong sold lots, and it fell to 1.1 jiao. Fuchang Yuan Mao Yong Zhaofeng Chang Changda Dada Cheng and others maintained their positions at the lows, and the report of Indian silver decreasing by another anna caused a rebound to 3.6 jiao. Shen Kang Hengxing Yuan Fuxing Yong Hengyu Renfa Yong and other companies jointly supplied lots, and the market could not withstand it. In addition, foreign telegraphic reports indicated that Japan transmitted rumors of a joint loan from the United States, England, and France to our government, and again it broke the 70 yuan barrier, falling to 69.1 jiao. Thereafter, due to double settlement prices, the field raised the pressure differently, and the market price struggled at 70 yuan. Ultimately, due to the supply of Qian Changxiang and other companies, the closing price was 969.7 jiao. Qian Changxiang Yuli and others sold lots after the close, and it retreated to within 9 jiao. It was found that the highest price of the day was 978.7 jiao, and the lowest price was 969.7 jiao, a degree of 9.6 jiao. As a result, it fell another 8 yuan compared to the previous close. The settlement price was listed as the central bank's gold standard price, retreating to 1,010.8 yuan, which was about 41 yuan lower than the closing price, and 6 yuan more than the previous closing price. The January log price was 975 yuan, the morning additional water was 966 yuan, and the afternoon additional water was 961 yuan. The pure gold price was 976.5 yuan, still 1 yuan lower than the period standard. The spot market was still deserted, lacking treasure purchases. Tianjin goods were roughly at parity with the period standard, but there were no transactions because the silver roots were still tight, and it was still difficult to make a deposit with 9 yuan of interest, so the buyers lacked appetite. It was heard that 998 of the color was slightly made by the Shanyin Gold Shop, according to the period mark, only adding 7 yuan 7.5 jiao, a small number of transactions. Trading in the arena remains heavy on the selling side, but buying activity is particularly fierce. In total, Dada Cheng Hengchang Yong Yifeng Yong Fuan Shun Mao Zheng Chang Fuxing Yong Shen Kang Heng Yu Yuan Sheng Yong and other companies are in the buying position. Yuan Yi Da Fa Yong Hong Kang Yong Tianfeng Ruixing Da Chang Xiang Juchang Wanchang Yong Dingkang Yuanchang Yong and other companies are in the selling position. Renfa Yong Fuxing Yong Qian Changxiang entered first and then exited, Fuyu Qingfa Yong Dingtai Fuchang Wanxing exited first and then entered. Dalian Bang Wanxing jointly made more than 900 lots,轧in more than 100 lots, Shunli jointly made more than 500 lots,轧out more than 100 lots, Guangbang Shengda entered and exited each 100 lots, Hengxing entered and exited less than 200 lots. The January futures margin was reduced to 28,651 lots, with a total of 61 long companies and 58 short companies. The total number of transactions on that day was 43,050 lots in the morning and 20,538 lots in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Sassoon Dumps Foreign Exchange, Further Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign news, the London large strips and the near Liaoning all contracted by 125, U.S. silver was unchanged, the Montelli forward silver price fell by 3 cents, London spot gold fell by 3 pence, British Pound to U.S. Dollar rose by 1 point 125, U.S. Dollar to British Pound also rose by 1 point 125, British Pound to French Franc rose by 18 pounds, U.S. Dollar to French Franc rose by 125. The morning opening selling price of the exchange market was 1 shilling 4 pence 75 for recent British Pound, and 34 yuan 5625 for U.S. Dollar, which was tighter by 0625 each for British Pound and U.S. Dollar compared to the previous closing. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with stability for British Pound and an increase of 0625 for U.S. Dollar. Customs Gold Unit fell by 5 cents, and the opening was flat. Sassoon immediately had a selling intention. Later, Sassoon vigorously dumped Sterling, and the process was stiff. HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with an increase of 125 for British Pound and 3125 for U.S. Dollar. Chinese merchants also had a selling stomach, and although banks bought, the trend was still stiff. When the silver equalization tax was announced unchanged, still levied at 6.75%, British Pound was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 5625, the market was slightly leveled, and banks took the opportunity to buy back cheaply, gradually returning to good. HSBC Communications came to buy Sterling, and at noon the general trend was flat. Although the market was flat in the afternoon, there was no reason for Sassoon to continue dumping out, so the process gradually hardened, and banks also slightly spit out, so even if Indian silver was slightly reduced, it did not help. Later, Sassoon's selling intention was stronger, and in addition, there was a telegraphic transfer of loans, and finally loosened. The recent selling price at the close was 1 shilling 4 pence 90625 for British Pound, and 34 yuan 9375 for U.S. Dollar, which was 09375 looser for British Pound and 3125 harder for U.S. Dollar compared to the previous closing. Chinese merchants did not make much difference in轧over, and Sassoon Bank dumped about 300,000 pounds of Sterling and 500,000 U.S. dollars. The day's turnover is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Collateral Rises Sequentially</h3>
<p>▲Also Made Two Jiao Seven Fen Market</p>

<h3>Guangdong Dollars React Violently</h3>
<p>The Overall Market Drops Drastically by 36 Yuan</p>
<p>Copper Coins Also Increase by 7,000 Wen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign exchange market still made 841 yuan at the opening in the morning, and fell by 3 yuan due to thin trading in the noon market, changing to 838 yuan, so the result was 3 yuan less than the previous day. The transaction made was 12,000 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the noon. Although the sales of Guangdong small foreign exchange were extraordinarily prosperous, the goods arriving from various routes were very涌, resulting in a drastic drop in price. The opening in the morning immediately fell by 16 yuan and 5 jiao, to 779 yuan and 5 jiao, and continued to fall by 19 yuan and 5 jiao in the noon market, to 760 yuan, and the result was 36 yuan less than the previous day.

<h3>Evening Session Rebound and Rise in Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw foreign exchange rates rise by another two points. The news from the general meeting was dull, and the Northern Syndicate's selling continued to pour in. Nos. 14 and 53, among others, were also heavily sold off, and No. 16 continued to be sold as well. Observing the situation, there was still an intention to suppress the small market in order to make up for losses. Therefore, the market price initially continued to decline, seemingly about to plummet. In the afternoon, the news improved, and everything at the general meeting went smoothly. As expected, there was an immediate rebound, with a strong rise. Various rumors also arose in the market, with some saying that large loans were approaching completion, and others saying that Hu Gong's arrival from the north was only a matter of time. Although these were unfounded, they could not be said to be entirely baseless. The market had already fallen for seven consecutive sessions, triggering a rebound, which was within expectations. The trend should continue to improve. Considering the recent high and low prices, the largest difference was more than four yuan, which was inconsistent with the environment. Although credit was tight, Chinese banks remained abundant. In the blink of an eye, banks would be closing their accounts, and with the Lunar New Year approaching, silver dollars would inevitably flow back. Therefore, the issue of credit was not a major problem, and short selling seemed to have missed its opportunity. Regarding yesterday's developments, No. 14 was sold off at the opening in the morning, followed by No. 53. No. 16 selectively suppressed the market. Under various pressures, the market price fell another three to five jiao. In the second session, No. 53 continued to be sold, and Nos. 33 and 38 also rushed to sell, further weakening the market by another two to three jiao or so. At the afternoon opening, the Northern Syndicate continued to sell off, and the front rows still could not rise, falling another two to three jiao. Since the gold shortage began, No. 35 followed No. 4 simultaneously, gradually turning around and rising by one to four jiao. The news was extremely good in the evening session. With a large number of short positions having been placed in recent days, there was a rush to cover them, leading to a strong rebound that grew more intense later in the session. The rebound came swiftly, with the short-term gold price surging by 8.5 jiao. As a result, the front rows still fell by two to three jiao, while the 20th-year bonds rose by two to four jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 25 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Renewed Buying Spree for U.S. Dollar Silver Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), New Far East Trading Co. reported that the New York stock market saw a mixed, slight increase led by silver stocks. News from the steel industry was unusually favorable, and according to various sources, silver advocates in the next Congress will propose a bill to mint hard currency. This led to renewed buying in gold and silver stocks. It is also rumored that investment trusts are now investing in gold mining stocks to hedge against future inflation. The bond market experienced turbulence, with foreign public bonds being particularly weak. This was attributed to Mussolini's order last Saturday, which was widely seen as an effort to prevent Italian gold from flowing out of the country. The small exchange market was stable, with a total of 850,000 shares traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>8th 10th Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 102.82 102.76 Down 0.06</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 36.93 37.50 Up 0.57</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>[PCurrent Sales Are Brisk, but the Yarn Market's Atmosphere Fails to Be Stimulated</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, with the situation slightly soft. However, current yarn sales are still brisk. Henan province in particular has a strong appetite for 17-count yarn, with purchases totaling 2,300 to 2,400 bales. However, market sentiment has failed to be stimulated, as some are waiting to sell when prices rise. This has resulted in a loosening of the surface, and the market has turned downward.</p>
<h3>The Golden Rooster Falls Slightly by More Than Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>The open of the morning yarn auction was influenced by a slight five-pound increase in US cotton and the favorable closing trend of the previous day. However, new buyers in the market were not strong, with prices for each month rising slightly by two to three jiao. As the auction reached the second and third sessions, it became increasingly soft, as some were selling when prices rose, resulting in ample supply in the market. Consequently, prices for each month fell again by three, four, five, or six jiao. The market situation remained flat at the afternoon opening. However, current yarn sales still exceeded 3,000 bales. Nevertheless, market sentiment failed to be stimulated, and prices for each month fell again by one, two, or four jiao. Sold were: Jifeng 550 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Jinchang 400 bales, Minghua 650 bales, Gengfeng 1,650 bales, Changfeng 1,700 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, and Tonghe 650 bales. Purchased were: Shengyuan 500 bales, Suilong 1,050 bales, Shenchang 2,400 bales, Dafu 500 bales, Tonghe 450 bales, Xincheng 400 bales, Tongji 450 bales, and Yuanda 700 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>May 190.0 189.2 189.4 Up 0.50 14,850</p>
<p>Total 264,500</p>
<h3>Current Yarn Trading Exceeds 3,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales remain brisk. Statistics show that various syndicates purchased a total of 3,380 bales throughout the day. Market conditions are similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each syndicate are listed below:</p>
<p>Henan 2,380 Changsha 245 Guangdong 140 Tianjin 5</p>
<p>Northern Syndicate 50 Jiangxi 110 Sichuan 30 Same Trade 10</p>
<p>Luzhou 60 Shantou 80 Ningbo 20</p>
<p>Inland 200 Yunnan 80 Fujian 10</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Decline Along with Gold Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening further. Although US cotton prices rose by five basis points, the decline in gold prices and the strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate are softening sentiment. According to news from a cotton industry organization, the inventory of cotton in the Northwest is ample, and most of it has not yet been shipped out. There is hope for a continued influx in the future. However, the Tongcheng Company and the Tongzhou Syndicate are absorbing quantities of cotton and are not releasing it.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Cotton Falls Back by Four to Five Jiao</h3>
<p>The morning cotton auction opened with the US cotton market remaining calm. However, one Hankou syndicate, facing financial difficulties, has gone bankrupt. They have fully offset and settled their short position of 30,000 dan of cotton. The market atmosphere was still good in the first two sessions, but it suddenly turned downwards in the third session. This was due to the gold price breaking the 70 yuan mark and the strengthening of the exchange rate, which led to more aggressive selling. Prices for all months fell by two to three jiao. In the afternoon, news emerged of a cotton merchant selling off, further weakening the market. The price for the current month fell by 0.35 yuan, and prices for distant months fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Sold were: Tongji 1,300 dan, Dafu 12,400 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Gengfeng 6,100 dan, Runkang 1,900 dan, Yifeng 2,700 dan, Yikang 2,800 dan, Changhe 2,900 dan, Tongfeng 3,000 dan, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Tongxing 1,900 dan, Changfeng 1,500 dan. Purchased were: Yifeng 2,300 dan, Dafu 1,700 dan, Suilong 5,000 dan, Shenchang 13,700 dan, Yuan Yi 1,400 dan, Changhe 1,900 dan, Xincheng 2,800 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Changhe 2,200 dan.

<h3>The World Cotton Market Sees Little Glory or Disgrace</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the US cotton market opened, prices rose by one to four basis points due to brokerage firms and fellow traders selling short, and good weekend business news. Except for sales to the government, the amount of selling was limited. Subsequently, due to a lack of trading, the market situation was mixed and slightly soft. Fellow traders are waiting for developments. The closing was still tight and stable, with spot prices up by five basis points, and futures prices up by one to five basis points. British cotton spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose or fell by one point. Indian cotton was weak initially due to short selling, but rebounded due to purchases by European exporters and brokerage firms. Pingguo fell by 7.5 jiao, Omlala was unchanged, and Bai Luoxi rose by 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (December 10th telegram).</p>

<h3>Profits from Grain are Mostly Given Back, Flour and Wheat Prices Soften</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed a pattern of large increases followed by small declines. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell slightly by 0.25 to 1.5 cents, while Canadian wheat fell by 1-2 cents. When prices opened, the market weakened as factories slightly lowered prices and some profits were given back step by step. As for the factories, they remained wary of selling due to the uncertainty of the tax rate, so the trend remained sluggish and the decline was limited. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable due to the active current sales of the northern syndicate. Although the market looked slightly better, it was later reported that the factories had continued to order a shipment of foreign wheat at a price of 4.80 yuan, which caused prices to fall again. Given the dwindling inventory of domestic wheat, the future looks bleak without the supply of foreign wheat. As a result, the price for the current month fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, December and January fell by 0.0125 yuan, and March and May fell by 0.125 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices for each month generally showed a flat and weak trend. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell slightly by 0.25 to 1.5 cents, while Canadian wheat fell by 1-2 cents. When prices opened, trading for each month was still active, but prices fell back as profits were given back, with near and distant months falling by 3-4 cents from the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the price for the current month rose by 2-3 cents due to tighter spot prices, and sentiment gradually stabilized. The prices for distant months were initially good, but the market weakened slightly due to news that the factories had continued to order a shipment of foreign wheat and profits were being given back. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 0.02 yuan, January fell by 0.02 yuan, and February and March fell by 0.01 yuan. In the current market, the demand from factories is good and inventories are low. The price of special-grade wheat has risen by 3-4 cents. For example, high-quality Guide wheat is priced at 4.09 yuan, Xuzhou wheat is priced at 4.07 yuan, Bengbu wheat is priced at 4.05 yuan, Shuixikou wheat is priced at 4.06 yuan, Yangzhou wheat is priced at 3.95 yuan, Suzhou wheat is priced at 4.05 yuan, and Hankou wheat is priced at 3.85 yuan, with a secondary grade priced at 3.82 yuan. Fuxin purchased 5,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 2,000 bags, Shenda purchased 1,000 bags, and Xinda purchased 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat was initially weak due to a lack of outside speculation, but prices turned flat due to a noticeable reduction in the available supply.</p>

<h3>Rice from He Xia Continues to Arrive in a Rush, Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the source of supply for various syndicates increased, with nearly 50 arrivals, mostly late rice. Therefore, the late rice market continued to show a downward trend. However, the sales market still seemed to react as it did before, losing momentum once prices fell. Customer syndicate demand was more active today, and Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, and other syndicates successively made purchases, with a total of more than 2,000 bags entering the market, which made the situation seem lively. However, prices had already fallen by 0.1-0.15 yuan and did not rebound. Arrivals and sales of thick japonica rice were balanced, and the market color turned stable. There was no glory or disgrace for various varieties such as Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan, as supply and demand were similar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, more than 20 ships arrived from He Xia. Sales of goods in the market were sluggish in the morning for white japonica early rice but improved in the afternoon. Early thin rice and various Jian, Yin, and Yuan varieties had normal sales. Prices in the white japonica market fell slightly in the early market, but tightened in the afternoon. The price of early thin rice fell slightly. The situation for other goods was similar.</p>
<h3>30,000 Bags of New Siamese Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>▲ Rough Ke Xian Retreats Slightly by Nearly 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign rice remained strong, and there was an upward trend in the market. However, two ships of 4-grade rice are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai soon, and a ship of Siamese rice arrived yesterday, carrying 30,000 bags of various machine-processed broken and whole rice. Therefore, the market stabilized. Domestic demand for machine-processed rice was strong, but foreign merchants continued to sell off, and囤户 were not strongly holding on. Yesterday, 1,800 tons of new trade were sold, and 300 tons were recovered. Another small transaction of 1,000 tons was made in the evening. Both inflows and outflows were active, and the market was settled. With a continuous stream of Ke Xian rice arriving in recent days, the prices of rough and machine-processed rice had risen sharply in recent days. However, with 7,000-8,000 bags arriving yesterday, demand from buyers weakened, and the market fell slightly by nearly 0.1 yuan. The machine-processed Xian rice market was stable, with sales mainly in the Shanghai streets and inland areas. Yesterday, Tianjin purchased 500 bags of machine-processed Jiang rice and 400 bags of machine-processed Yuan rice.</p>
<h3>Bran Inventory is Not Thick</h3>
<p>▲ However, Yesterday's Price Fell Slightly by Two to Three Cents</p>
<p>The bran market has been slightly weak recently, as the inland sales channels are not active and Dongzhuang has also temporarily stopped. Compared to the previous week, prices have fallen slightly by two to three cents. Miscellaneous brands are priced at 2.72-2.73 yuan, while Hua Feng and Fu Xin bran are priced at around 2.80 yuan. However, the inventories of various factories are thin, so the future is not expected to be very low. However, the current market price is too high, and domestic consumption may be hesitant to proceed.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Continue to Rise, Sesame Sales are Brisk</h3>
<p>| Rumors of a 40% Reduction in Oil Tax |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market remained strong. Supplies were limited and inflows were not abundant. In addition to continuous demand from Zhejiang Shaoxing and Shanghai, demand from Wenzhou and Taizhou increased. Yesterday, Hankou soybeans rose by 0.13-0.14 yuan, with over 4,000 bags traded at prices ranging from 3.52 to 3.53 yuan. Over 1,500 bags of medium and high-quality Hankou soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 3.52 to 3.58 yuan, with prices rising by 0.04-0.05 yuan. 400 bags of Haocheng soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 3.68 to 3.62 yuan, with prices rising by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Over 400 bags of Xin'anzhen soybeans were offered at prices ranging from 3.64 to 3.62 yuan, also rising by 0.06-0.07 yuan. The quality of Guide soybeans was lower, and the market also rose by 0.02-0.03 yuan, with 700 bags traded. The sales channels included inland factories in Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Taizhou. In the afternoon, rumors circulated that the import tax on oil, calculated as 15% of the value after adding tariffs, might be reduced by 40%. This caused the standard oil price to fall. The Ewo Foreign Firm sold 800 tons of sesame seeds the day before yesterday at a price of 9.50 yuan. Yesterday, due to the decline in the gold price and exchange rate fluctuations, the telegram quoting 9.50 yuan had not been confirmed at the closing of the market and no transaction was made.

<h3>Wax Industry Sets List Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local wax industry association continuously received news from Hankou, saying that old oil in the production area had already diminished. Although new goods have been introduced, the source of supply has been limited. In addition, the demand from various syndicates is strong, and buyers are holding back in anticipation of higher prices. Therefore, Jingshan hemp oil has been following the price increases, and the association has set list prices to notify all members to comply. The discussion is as follows: Heavy Jing without wood is priced at 19 yuan per 石, famous Jing is priced at 18.8 yuan per 石, ordinary Jing is priced at 18 yuan per 石, Macheng (market jin per dan) is priced at 17 yuan, and Sichuan (market jin) is priced at 104 yuan.</p>

<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>Matters of Human Nature and the World</h3>
<p>— Whistle</p>
<p>What is meant by "matters of human nature and the world"? "Matters of human nature and the world" are originally a type of "art of living." But if we wish to study the "art of living," we must first meticulously study "matters of human nature and the world." What is meant by "human nature?" It refers to the common dispositions and temperaments of humankind. What is meant by "worldly wisdom?" It refers to the constantly evolving and bizarre states that society presents.</p>
<p>Human nature is about "seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune." Towards auspicious matters, we should flock like ducks, and towards inauspicious matters, we should take flight far away, thus "turning misfortune into good fortune." Human nature is about "fearing the strong and bullying the weak." We must not provoke strong friends, lest we "pat flies on a tiger's head." It's permissible to manipulate weaker friends, as they are powerless to resist, which is called "smart people don't suffer immediate losses." Human nature is about "shying away from difficulty and enjoying ease." Therefore, everyone strives to do easy things, while difficult things are met with folded arms and indifference, allowing us to avoid "bumping our heads."</p>
<p>There are many such examples of human nature. Here, I have only briefly cited a few as rules. After understanding "human nature," we then play it out in society scene by scene, which is called "worldly wisdom." Therefore, if one deeply understands the changes in "matters of human nature and the world," then "the way to conduct oneself is half-considered." But simply knowing is not enough; one must also "practice it with the principle of forgiveness." Suppose I believe something is ominous, difficult, or hard to do. Not only will I not do it myself, but I will also advise others not to do it. Suppose I believe something is auspicious, soft, and easy to do. I will do it first and invite everyone to join me.</p>
<p>Therefore, to study the "art of living," one must first be familiar with "matters of human nature and the world." Because by being familiar with "matters of human nature and the world," one knows the methods of "seeking" and "avoiding," and the ways of "welcoming" and "rejecting." But if one is too familiar with human nature and the world, one will inevitably "anticipate others' wishes" everywhere, and "live under the thumb of others" in everything, completely losing the ability to act autonomously. There will only be objective opinions, with no subjective existence, and life will be entirely mechanical. If one is not familiar with "matters of human nature and the world," one will often encounter obstacles in speaking and acting, which is what is called "young and inexperienced," "not knowing how to read the room," or "not being able to see which way the wind blows." Not only will things not be accomplished, but one will also be ridiculed and harshly criticized. Such people are called "blockheads."</p>
<p>Does this mean that being familiar with "matters of human nature and the world" is bad, and not being familiar with them is also bad? How are we supposed to conduct ourselves? The ancients had a good analogy for "the way to conduct oneself," saying that it is like a copper coin. The so-called copper coin refers to the old-style cash, not the current copper plate. Because the old-style cash had a round outer shape and a square hole, conducting oneself is like cash, requiring one to be "outwardly flexible and inwardly principled." Therefore, it occurs to me that conducting oneself in the past was like cash, while conducting oneself now is like copper plates, because they are only round and have no squareness. Is there a satirical meaning in abolishing cash and using copper plates? Some people also say that conducting oneself is like "gambling." Conducting oneself in the past was like playing "Sixty-Four," which was fixed and unchangeable. Conducting oneself now is like playing "poker," which is all about "taking advantage of opportunities." Victory goes to those who can seize opportunities, and failure goes to those who cannot. This analogy is quite reasonable. Although these two matters are small, they can also greatly reflect the current "matters of human nature and the world."</p>
<p>But, in the end, one cannot rely entirely on "seizing opportunities," nor can one be completely "smooth." Conducting oneself should be equipped with three essential conditions: first, to clearly distinguish right from wrong; second, to recognize the truth; and third, to understand the trends of the times. If one can understand these three conditions, it is fine whether one knows "matters of human nature and the world" or not. Because the degradation of Chinese character and the decline of ambition are mostly due to being too familiar with "matters of human nature and the world."</p>
<h3>Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Qichang</p>
<p>This was an early winter night, the wind howling. He had been running around all day, hitting several snags, and had not found any money. He also failed to rent a house. He knew that if he went back like this, his wife would definitely start a quarrel, but because he was hungry, and also because he didn't want his wife to wait too long, he had no choice but to drag his heavy feet from North Sichuan Road back to their apartment in the French Concession.</p>
<p>The apartment was quiet. Under the dim light, only a dozing tea boy was squatting in the corner, waiting for the guests' calls. Everything was deathly silent. With a heart full of shame, he blankly walked into the dilapidated apartment, stepping into the room that was half the size of an attic. His wife was already lying in bed asleep. Although she knew he had come in, she silently rolled her eyes and pretended to be asleep. Was she really angry? He wondered, but he couldn't help but speak:</p>
<p>"Lan! Are you not feeling well? Have you eaten?"</p>
<p>Getting no response, he put on a smiling face, sat on the edge of the bed, and continued to ask, stroking her hair:</p>
<p>"Lan! Are you not feeling well? Have you eaten?"</p>
<p>"What is feeling well or not feeling well? Since I married you, have I had a single day of feeling well? This time we came back to Shanghai, I thought I could have some comfortable days, but who knew we wouldn't even have a home, living in such a dirty apartment and suffering like this!" As she spoke, her stern tone gradually softened, and she finally cried.</p>
<p>"Lan! Don't be sad anymore. What does such a small setback matter? We can settle down in the next day or two and get our lives in order. Believe me, we have a solution for everything!"</p>
<p>"What solution? I've suffered enough this year! But haven't you been saying everything has a solution? To be honest, I'm not a child anymore. These words are only good for fooling yourself!"</p>
<p>"When have I ever intended to deceive you? You have to understand that in this kind of society, finding a job is not easy! But everything will be resolved in a couple of days. Don't worry. Lan! Don't be so childish. Let's discuss and plan everything slowly! ... Have you eaten?"</p>
<p>"Who even wants to eat? What time is it? It's fine if you don't mention it, but as soon as you do, I wish I could kill you! I can tolerate the physical suffering because you're unemployed and we have financial difficulties. But I can't stand the mental anguish. Think about it: like today, from morning until now, being trapped alone in this dilapidated little room, alas! It's so hard to bear! I used to hear people say that the worst thing is being in prison, but today I want to say that the most painful thing in life is being me today..." She sobbed as if she had suffered some great injustice.</p>
<p>He had been running around outside all day, hitting several snags, and had been holding back a bellyful of frustration, looking for a place to vent it. But when he saw his wife's sadness, and thought about their happiness and future, he had to suppress his anger. He had always been a very easygoing person when it came to life. So, since losing his job last year, he had suffered mostly disasters this year, making him feel that the only person in this world who could sympathize with him and share his hardships was his wife. Therefore, he deeply sympathized with his wife's pain and anger. He tried hard to forget the pain of reality and pursue the happiness of the future. This future happiness was like the electric rabbit in a dog race, tempting him ahead. Therefore, even when he was exhausted, he still tightly chased after it, rushing towards the light of the future. This gave him some comfort. He thought, he forgave his wife's quarrel and patiently comforted her:</p>
<p>"Stop quarreling, Lan! Tomorrow we'll settle down, and everything will be fine. Get up and eat quickly, it's getting late."</p>
<p>He had to put on a happy face in front of his wife and ordered two meals to eat with her.</p>

<h3>The Art of Getting Along in the World</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In this day and age, everything is difficult, especially getting along in the world. The first problem in getting along in the world is eating. Originally, in these times when there is a panic about eating everywhere, eating is really not an easy thing. So, if you don't eat, how can you get along in the world? This really makes people sigh, "It's easy to be a person, but difficult to get along in the world!"</p>
<p>If eating is difficult, then getting along in the world is naturally even more difficult. If you act too fiercely, you will suffer at the hands of others. If you act too kindly, you won't be able to grab a job. If you are neither kind nor fierce, then perhaps people will say you are a half-wit. So I say: It is extremely difficult to get along in the world now. Being tough doesn't work, and being soft doesn't work either. Brute force and barbarism are ineffective, and yielding and giving in are even worse. Alas! How difficult it is to be a person today!</p>
<p>In the past, heroes created the times, but now the times create heroes. Because it is not easy to get along in the world, it has enabled experts who understand the art of getting along in the world and are good at using the methods of ascending to success to be the first to arrive, strutting around as if they were great men of the times. Those who are not familiar with the threshold of this path can only "watch others soar through the clouds."</p>
<p>In fact, getting along in the world is not such a difficult thing. It's just that we dullards were born with an unlucky life, so it is like this. Otherwise, since our parents gave birth to us, and our innate five senses and four limbs are all complete, we already look like a human being. Since we have the conditions for getting along in the world, why worry about not succeeding? This is certainly due to a lack of research on the cultivation of "getting along." Therefore, although we have the form of getting along, we have not yet acquired the substance of getting along. Like a "monkey wearing a hat," we look at ourselves and think we are very important, happily believing that we have indeed become a person. But in the eyes of others, we are still just a hairy-faced, sharp-mouthed monster.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand that to get along in the world, you must understand the art of getting along. But even if you understand it like a blind person listening to a lecture, and you don't know how to use it, or you don't use it properly, isn't it still a waste of effort? Although everyone knows that currying favor with the powerful and flattering smiles are the best ways to get ahead, I have also put in a lot of effort into this. At the time, I really wanted to "study hard for ten years without anyone asking, and become famous overnight." But the reality was the opposite of my ideal. Not only does this method not work now, but also poor kids run into walls everywhere, getting a nose full of ash.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to become a perfect modern man, I have been diligently studying the art of getting along in the world for the past three years, sparing no effort. Although I have not succeeded myself, I want to create a group of smart readers. Those who are interested may as well try to apply the methods. They are tested and proven a hundred times over. Anyway, I have a fearless spirit of sacrifice, but there are only notes, and no lectures. The courses are listed below:</p>
<p>The art of flattery, the method of bragging, the cultivation of a thick skin, the practice of scheming, the pluralistic theory of personality, the training of patience, and the secrets of prying open back doors. If you can fully learn this supreme art, I believe that not only will you be able to get along in the world with satisfaction and be welcomed and supported everywhere, but you will also have no worries about food and clothing for the rest of your life. You may even be promoted and get rich. You can get whatever you want easily. If you want to "make a living with a skill," this is the only way.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, we will give away a "mask" and a "General Introduction to the Art of Getting Along in the World," which are priceless. The supply is limited, so hurry, hurry.</p>
<h3>Mary</h3>
<p>— Ying Jiang</p>
<p>Isn't it strange? Because I played a "street person" for a day, everyone calls me "Mary." Not only do the people in the drama club call me that, but even those unfamiliar college students do. Sometimes they even follow behind me and ask, "Where did your John go?" to tease me, which is really embarrassing! But, after a long time, it feels very natural, and the name "Mary" naturally replaced my real name. Okay, now "Mary" is my name, but I can't bear a tragedy like the one in "Street People." I always think this way.</p>
<p>I remember one day, because I was bored at home, I braved the heavy snow and ran to the drama club to play. As soon as I stepped into the door, a surge of warmth rushed to my heart, because the room was full of vibrant energy. A group of young drama enthusiasts – the mustachioed director, the effeminate makeup artist, the silly old general affairs officer, the backstage boss who played the mother, and my handsome John – were sitting around the stove, talking loudly. Seeing me come in, John shouted out without hesitation: "Ah! Mary, it's so cold outside! Why did you run out?" I took off my coat, sat down next to the stove, and answered him with the lines from "Street People": "Yes, it's really cold outside. But what can I do? You know, I rushed out when the theater closed. I ran all the way to the entrance of the Paris Theater, braving the snow, begging the gentlemen, ladies, and madams who came out of the theater to give me a franc or two to support my Mary. But I begged and pleaded, running after their cars, letting the mud splash on my clothes. In the end, the answer they gave me was not the francs I was hoping for, but a rude scolding! Damn it! One day..." I had just recited to this point when the effeminate makeup artist cut in with a strange accent: "One day, one day what do you plan to do?" The shameless John snatched to answer: "One day, Mary and I will have a little baby!" This made everyone laugh, but it made me so angry that I wanted to die. I said, "John! If you are so immoral, I will never pay attention to you again!" John was busy apologizing to me, saying nice things. This kid is really annoying, always making people's hearts itch... In fact, this little John is strangely interesting and lovable! I thought this way, and my cheeks began to burn red. But, when I turned my face and saw the square-faced silly general affairs officer, my heart turned cold, and the shyness I felt just now was replaced with a sense of disgust. He always stared at me with his eyes, like a hungry wolf. Especially when I thought of his past ugly behavior of pursuing me, it was really disgusting. The backstage boss mother asked this and that like a mother asking about family matters, planning the work of the drama club. The mustachioed director was always teaching me earnestly like a teacher. To be honest, my success on the stage was also because of him. So, I respected and feared him, and sometimes I even called him "Dad." The makeup artist, although he was an effeminate person, was a pervert, like a clown. In the end, John was still a little bit lovable. But, I don't want to be Mary in "Street People." I always think this way.</p>
<h3>The Male Heart</h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>I no longer wish to associate with you.</p>
<p>You gave me a kind of temptation that will gradually cause me to lose my male self-esteem and surrender. I will not do this.</p>
<p>Since last summer, after I became friends with you in that small house on XX Road, I have already learned through observation and investigation that you are a woman with a decadent consciousness, a poor environment, lonely and helpless, and putting on the airs of a young lady. I also know that you have already reached the brink of financial collapse, but you lied to me about having a certain amount of savings and wanting to do something in society. This kind of fallen social butterfly's trick gave me an impression that was both laughable and pathetic. Moreover, you have already become disillusioned and depressed, to the point where you are about to fall into the vortex of ordinary women's pleasures. However, you are pretending to be a woman with a future in front of me, with amazing thoughts, which made me despise you even more in my heart. At that time, since I understood everything about you, I naturally did not succumb to your sweet words and physical temptations.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I really pitied you and was willing to help you do some work in social affairs. Therefore, I persuaded you to embark on the path of literature, revised your articles for you, taught you to study books, and also spent a lot of effort, hoping that you would achieve something. My view is that a woman who has worked hard in the revolutionary cause has been trained in her thinking and ideas. She can always wake up and turn back from the brink of the abyss of decline. Moreover, she is also a woman who loves literature and art, so she can always wholeheartedly dedicate herself to the literary and artistic movement, stabilize her wild and unrestrained mind, excite her feelings of moving forward and upward, and become a literary and artistic apprentice who is hardworking, able to endure hardship, and diligent in learning, in order to achieve success in literature and art.</p>
<p>But you have disappointed me!</p>
<p>You have no confidence in literature. You do not study and learn attentively. The articles you write are so hasty and careless. You do not carefully revise them to achieve true goodness and beauty. You just write a bit when you are happy, and that is it. You do not even revise them a second time. It is completely a game of pen and ink for idle people, not the serious attitude of a literary apprentice in learning to write literary works. Although you have published a few works in newspapers and magazines, they are not the kind of things you want, but you think you are satisfied and do not want to work hard to create successful works. Moreover, recently you have not even been working hard at writing. The success of a writer is not so easy, but you take the fame of a writer too lightly and do not consider the efforts of others to be such a big deal. Although the current Chinese literary world is full of smog and the Shanghai School writers are emerging one after another, exhibiting ugliness everywhere, there are still writers who can be respected and writers who are striving upwards. You cannot despise the entire Chinese literary world because of the contemptible Shanghai School writers. In particular, you cannot despise the creation of literary works because the Shanghai School writers become famous quickly.</p>
<p>However, you despise the entire literary world, and therefore you despise the creation of literary works even more. You have disappointed me.</p>
<p>If I were a female worshiper, naturally, you would have captured my heart long ago. But you have not tried to understand me and think that I am just like ordinary men. You are also going to be disappointed in me.</p>
<p>The male heart is more rational and self-respecting than your female heart. If he feels that he can use reason to fight against emotions, and that he has already conquered emotions, then he will embark on the path of reason and not look back.</p>
<p>You must know that the male heart is: career is more important than love.</p>
<p>Goodbye, friend! When you discover that the person you are pursuing has disappeared, you should use your smart brain to study the reasons for your failure, which will be beneficial to you. Otherwise, you will fall into an unrecoverable state.</p>
<p>I will tell you one last sentence: the tricks you use on men are actually not very clever. They are so hypocritical and so foolish!</p>

A letter has been sent to report this. It is not a case of submitting the same manuscript to two publications. This is hereby corrected as follows.</p>

<h3>Opening [Shuangwen Worships the Moon]</h3>
<p>Waiting for the Moon in the West Chamber, the moon gradually rises, Hongniang follows the young lady. The young lady is Wang Zan, head adorned with flawless jade. Two golden hairpins divide the cloud-like temples. Double pearl earrings sway. White silk shirt emits a unique fragrance. Wang wears a pair of gold bracelets on her arm. Her chest is adorned with dazzling clothing beads. A silk handkerchief is held in her slender hands. Pink trousers bind her slender waist. Cleansing knees, with silk ribbon. Red floral shoes, spotless. Walking to the pavilion, she stops. Nine lotus lanterns hang high in front of the pavilion. Green moss sleeps with white rabbits. Wind blows butterflies dreaming in the shade of flowers. Red pear trees are full of red pear blossoms. Special red flowers wither, the peony pavilion. Locked cloud terrace, lazy to play the piano. Banana leaf fan chases fireflies. I am ten thousand miles away to meet Zhang Junsan. Zhang Sheng meets a kindred spirit in the Buddhist hall. Retiring the rebel soldiers, his merits are displayed in the Kirin Pavilion. He is like Kong Ming in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Tonight, the bright moon shines in the Weak Green Garden. Kneeling on a brocade cushion, secretly confessing sincerity. Wishing to pluck laurel branches in the moon palace, climb the gold list. A skillful marriage, flower candles tied together. Forever united, a century-long marriage.</p>

The two went out to drink together, and when they reached the street, they met a knife seller who shouted: [Treasure knife!] Lin Chong took one look and saw that it was indeed a treasure knife, so Lin Chong bought the knife, but from this knife, the great disaster of Lin Chong's family's destruction descended!</p>

<h3>[Falling Rosy Clouds and a Lonely Wild Duck]</h3>
<p>Feng Yuru took Jiang Qiuwu's photo and thought about it, but couldn't come up with a suitable solution. Just as she was in trouble, Niu Tangjian also brought a photo and said to Feng Yuru: [This is the son of a big tailor, his family is very rich, and he wants to lead you.] In Feng Yuru's eyes, how could she look up to a vulgar tailor? Of course, she would refuse. However, Niu Tangjian had received the Wang tailor's activity fee and had to force Yuru to agree. Seeing that Yuru didn't agree, Niu Tangjian immediately became furious and locked Yuru in a dark room.</p>

The next day, Li Taozhi went to Qingliang Mountain to meet Yu Shuicun again.</p>

<h3>Sent to Li Danyuanyuan Xi Wei Yingwu</h3>
<p>Last year, I met you among the flowers, Today, the flowers bloom again after a year.</p>
<p>The world is vast and difficult to predict, Spring sadness is bleak, and I am the only one who is blind.</p>
<p>My body is full of diseases, and I think of the fields and villages, I am ashamed to receive my salary while wandering.</p>
<p>I heard that you want to come and ask, How many times will the moon be round in the West Building?</p>
<h3>Same Title, Immortal Tour View Han Yi</h3>
<p>The fairy platform first saw the Five Cities Tower, The scenery is bleak, and the rain has just stopped.</p>
<p>The mountain colors are connected remotely, the trees are late, The sound of the hammer is close, reporting the autumn of the Han Palace.</p>
<p>Sparse pine shadows fall on the empty altar, quiet, Fine grass and spring fragrance, a secluded small cave.</p>
<p>Why bother to look for a place outside the world, There is also a Danqiu in the human world.</p>
<h3>Spring Thoughts Huangfu Ran</h3>
<p>Orioles sing and swallows speak, reporting the New Year, Horses are far away, the Dragon Mound road is thousands of miles.</p>
<p>Living in the city near the Han Garden, My heart follows the bright moon to the land of the Hu.</p>
<p>The brocade letters in the loom discuss endless hate, The flowers on the building laugh at my lonely eyes.</p>
<p>May I ask Yuan Rong's precious chariot, When will you return to Yan Ran?</p>
