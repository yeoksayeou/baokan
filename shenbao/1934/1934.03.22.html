<h3 id="c15">内蒙自治之前途廷 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>内蒙錫林果勒盟副盟長德穆楚克楝普魯親王之倡議自治。本具複雜之背景。中央應付事變。頗費苦心。二月二十八日中政會通過蒙古自治原則八條。三月七日通過蒙古地方自治政務委員會暫行組織大綱十一。條及指導長官公署條例九條。皆於公布後實行。並特派何應欽氏爲指導長官。自去年九月二十八日錫烏伊三盟召集百靈廟會議主張組織自治政府以來。紛擾五閲月之内蒙自治問題。至是始告一段落。</p>
<p>細繹上述公布文件之要點。不外三端。（一）以蒙古人組織自治委員。會辦理各旗盟地方自治政務。而受中央主管機關之指導。指導長官對於委員會之處理事件認爲不當時。得糾正及撤消之。（二）調解省縣與盟族之爭議。其辦法凡三。（甲）限制漢民移殖蒙地屯墾。（乙）割分省縣與盟族之地方税。（丙）限制增設縣治或設局。（三）維持各盟旗之内部固有組織及管轄治理權。條文内容大致尙稱扼要。按漢蒙關係之隔閡。本非偶然。内蒙在清時本有二十四部。分爲六盟。四十九旗。各旗旗長由清帝封爲札蕯克。命之管理旗務。同時又利用王公喇嘛。以資覊縻。庫倫科布多等各要地且各駐紥辦事大臣。監視一切。似此恩威兼施。故能相安無事。至民國三年。北政府爲謀行政統治之便利。劃内蒙爲熱河察哈爾綏遠等三特别區域。十七年國民政府復將此三特别區域改建爲省。省中政區。分爲縣區與盟旗。蒙人對此改制。頗感憤懣。其尤難堪者。則因漢人在蒙自由移殖及屯墾軍隊。因之以遊牧爲業之蒙民生活基礎。根本動搖。此次中央公布之自治原則。頗能洞燭個中廠結所在。而予以適當之處置。然吾人猶認爲遺憾者。内蒙民智閉塞。封建制度。依然存在。所謂民族自决自治之說。本由德王等片面宣傳而來。夫人而不欲置信。吾人縱不便强令各王公改革現制。放棄封建。予蒙民以實行治權之機會。似亦不必以明文核准各盟旗之傳統的内部組織及其統轄關係。今旣有此條文。竊恐自治云者。反爲各王公平添一代民自治之根據。徒使與眞正民族自决之精神背道而馳而已。</p>
<p>今後内蒙自治成敗之關健。吾人認爲在人而不在於制度。在外交而不在於内政。發動此次自治運動之德王。居嘗以成吉思汗自期。其志殊不在小。今所得者。乃一不足輕重之自治政務委員會委員。其不能卽此甘心罷手。自不待論。矧各委員人選中。有曾與德王互相攻訐者。（按德王曾因整理蒙古王公代表團駐京辦事處一事。與委員中某氏大起衝突。德王計劃失敗。忿忿離京）。亦有與其志趣不甚相同者。將來同床異夢。糾紛必多。但苟有指導自治長官。親臨監視。以防患於未然。則猶可說。中政會頒布之自治原則。明定指導長官當駐在自治政務委員會之所在地。實卽此意。奈自治政務委員會現定設於内蒙之百靈廟。而長官公署則仍擬設於北平。已與原則不合。而况兩地相去甚遥。遇事指導。不免有鞭長莫及及視聽隔膜之苦。今何應欽氏因北平軍分會公務覊身。不克長川駐在内蒙。實行指導。日前當蒙古代表當面勸駕時。且曾表示謙辭。夫指導自治。責任綦重。中央旣經特派大員。自當予以發揮指導全力之機會不然。則毌寗另派大員之爲愈。</p>
<p>内蒙自治。旣由口頭與筆墨宣傳而漸卽於事實矣。然而吾人仍覺惴惴不安。爲我邊防與蒙古同胞恐懼者。厥爲日本對於察東之企回意猶未已。野心肆張。不得不　。東北淪亡後。日本對僞滿境内之東蒙三盟。早經許其自治待遇王公。備極優渥。夫司馬昭之心。路人皆知。日人懷柔愚弄。寗有善意。而頭腦簡單之内蒙王公仍難免不見獵心喜。受其覊絆。吾人苟非健忘。當知田中併呑滿蒙奏摺中本有建設［蒙古大源共和國］之陰謀。自傀儡僭位後。形勢更危。則所謂内蒙自治。其不至如　花之一現者幾希。日前蒙代表尼瑪等三人。請求察省府交涉撤退多倫沽源之日軍。以便自治政務委員會成立之設施。内蒙自治之成敗。吾人將先以察東日東之進退卜之。内蒙王公等曾云。［軍事外交。關切國家體制。吾蒙能鮮力薄。平時猶仰仗中央之助力。况當存亡關頭。一切對外措施。更惟中央是賴］。深望我政府能貫澈初衷。以扶植蒙民之自治也。</p>

<h3 id="c122">牛莊輪船觸礁 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>揚子江口觸破兩洞</p>
<p>派船助救來滬修理</p>
<p>前日下午、滬上發生大風、海面且有霧露、本埠太古公司牛莊輪船在揚子江口、因受大霧颶風之侵襲、船卽觸礁破壞甚大、滬行得報、已派船前往拖救、本館記者得訊、卽經切實調查、茲將詳情分述如下</p>
<h3 id="c123">途遇風霧 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>牛莊輪船載重二千四百八十噸、向駛南北洋各埠、此次由天津載貨、直放福州起卸、至二十日上午十一時、船到揚子江口、適值海面發生颶風、且有大霧迷漫、航行殊覺困難、船主擬在該處抛錨暫避、詎料航道已爲霧蔽、</p>
<h3 id="c124">觸礁破壞 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>該輪尙未抛錨正在行駛中、不料已觸及礁石、船底遂爲撞破、裂穿兩洞、海水立卽進入艙内、猶幸該輪各艙均有鐵板間隔、不致波及全船、船主急卽下令開駛快車、向附近淺灘駛去、使輪船不致下沉當開至揚子江口西四海哩之淺灘上擱停、以待救援、</p>
<h3 id="c125">急電求救 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>船主立用無綫電、向滬行報告、並要求派輪前</p>
<p>往助救、太古公司接得該輪電告、先電令來滬在途之甘州輪、駛往該處援助、並察看受損狀况、昨晨、（卽二十一號）滬行復派華通小輪、在滬裝運機工、水泥木板以及各項救船器具、急切駛赴揚子江口、至牛莊輪失事地點、帮同修理船身、及吸抽船内積水等等、</p>
<h3 id="c126">今晨可到 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>現第一步急救工作、先將牛莊輪中之礁石觸破兩洞、設法用水泥塗好、然後再行設法拖救、來滬修理、記者下午至該行詢問、據稱、牛莊輪觸礁、已在救護中、大致今日（卽二十二日）上午、可望拖曳至上海修理矣、至于船内水浸漬客貨、刻尙未知詳清、須待船到上海出卸後、始可檢騐得知</p>

<p>永康前往拖救</p>
<p>現尙無法曳出</p>
<p>三北公司湖南航業、爲六公司之冠、現有鴻字號江輪四艘、往來行駛、此次鴻利輪在上海運貨赴湘、係上游漲水後第一艘開赴長沙輪、鴻利去貨、以棉紗爲最多、該輪吃水甚淺、重儎亦不過八尺左右、故今次往湘、似可通行無事、</p>
<h3 id="c128">船身遭擱淺 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>詎意船近長沙下泥港附近江面突告擱淺、船體深陷沙泥、當塲船主百計設法、總不能脫出淺灘、祇得急向長沙漢口兩地飛告、要求派船往救、鴻和擱淺之處、目爲妨害長沙航道、故長沙關在鴻利失事後、亦派員同往監視拖救、</p>
<h3 id="c129">派船往救援 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>漢口分局得報、卽轉電上海、立派永康輪前往拖曳、當由永康輪用最粗最堅鋼絲纜繩、套上鴻利、由永康以全速率拖救、無奈鴻利重儎陷泥、擱淺甚深、一時無法拖出、在竭力前曳時、鋼絲纜竟至拖斷、而仍未能將鴻利救出、</p>
<h3 id="c130">駁貨後再拖 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>現在湘中各貨主、以鴻利輪内之貨、久阻在船、殊妨市面營業、遂由各客帮與三北公司分局磋商、决計將鴻利輪中貨物、先行起卸上駁船、載赴長沙、現在派永康輪拖駁子五隻、前往下泥港、至鴻利近畔、先將船内之貨駁卸運湘、再候水漲、進行拖救、</p>

<p>昨日有位自稱東北難民的方君提出了怎樣研究東北問題、要本部加以注意、現在我們先對方君的觀念作一不客氣澄清、明天再論研究這一問題的方法、編者</p>
<p>我們很感謝方君提出這樣一個實際問題，使我們得有機會重新喚起讀者們對於東北問題的注意和討論。我們早就說過，理論與實際是不能分離的。無論研究社會科學或文學，如果專讀死書，對於實際問題毫不注意，那你卽使讀書萬卷，也只好做一個書呆子。所以，每當我們處理一般問題時，總當當提出許多具體問題來做例證，自然這樣還是不够，我們還應該多多以具體的實際問題來做討論的中心。關於這一點，我們除完全接收方君的意見外，我們尙希望讀者以後多提出這類實際問題來討論。　　對於方君的來信，我們可以分成兩部份來答覆··一部份是根據方君所述及的東北現狀，加以簡要的解釋；另一部份便是怎樣研究東北問題。</p>
<p>先說第一部份。方君所述及的東北現狀，當然許多地方是千眞萬確的。帝國主義對待一切殖民地都是如此··一面用高壓政策，一面却用懷柔政策，這是最毒辣的政策。不過，從方君的來信，我們看到方看似乎只顧及問題的一方面··看到滿洲一時裝成的繁榮而没有看到其中潛存的危機；看到民氣外表的消沈，而没有看到消沈的原因及潛伏中的數萬萬民衆的力量與反帝的抗爭。無疑的，九一八，一二八後在中國不同的生活羣團間起了絕對不同的態度。一部分人，確是［消沉］，不！或者更正確的說，是［不關心］，或者刻毒點說，他們反是很樂觀的，他們只會賣弄美麗的詞句，以朦朧大家的耳目。方君對於［歌舞舁平］的海上，不禁浩人的［氣］、並不能包括大衆在内，這些高等華人何嘗到今日纔是如此，［高而夫，［狐步舞］在一二八當日又何曾憇過一夜呢？這些地方，自然，辛苦勤勞的人們是不能入内的。會說話的人們，自已不做，大槪不高興别人做的。關於抗日方面，我們確曾看見許多人要［抗］，用血去換血的幹，但同時也有阻止人家去幹的，並不惜用［血］去爭取這一國策的勝利的。自然，一時的勝利是要歸於這一羣團的。</p>
<p>於是，在外表上，雖然民族危機日益嚴重，現象形態上反現出［歌舞舁平］，大衆沉默，幻影出方君的錯覺來。</p>
<p>在另一羣團呢？他們打不起［高而夫］，無力去作［狐步舞］，他們是在生活中受磨難，已逼迫到死亡線上了。他們除與帝國主義拚過你死我活外，並無其他的知路可找。這些人，自然要驚擾舞塲的爵士音樂的，雖然有時被逼得不准作聲，國中滿邊界的［匪］，雖然天天在會剿，可是，騷擾遠是依然，天下並不清平。這就知道，冷的地壳下面，還有着熊熊的火燄，地球並未眞的死滅呀！</p>
<p>講到義勇軍抗日，我們固然十分的敬佩以前的英勇行爲，可是，說到力的對比及質的純粹上，目下殘存的民衆武力吤然在數量上確是比前微弱，但實在要比以前更爲樂觀的。因爲在以前的陣線内實在太多高等華人了，現今將軍抗日成名，自然應該息影名山，受人間香花供餋了。埋頭去做傻子的當然只有眞正不怕死的［渾渾噩噩的愚民］。這一來，大的［軍］雖然改爲小的游擊戰，在日本軍方面，確是有點麻煩，因爲這些賤種是不愛財帛賄賂的。因此，在這方面也是形成一個矛盾，在現象上義勇軍確是削弱了，在骨子裏，義勇軍正在生長，編排，方君可惜也只看到外表的。</p>
<p>總之，方君看到的人與事，都是穿上幻覺的衣裳了，都是受了高等華人烟幕彈的欺騙。雖然激昂憤慨，不免充滿的是失敗主義的情緖，悲觀主義的情緖，好像對於東北只有絕望似的，其實並不如此。</p>
<p>這是一種錯誤，固然，我們怎樣也不能否認日帝國主義懷柔政策對於東北民衆的影響，怎樣也不能忽視奴隸敎育對於東北民衆的作用；同時我們也再不能容忍大家甘於沉悶。但我們更應該認識現實，對東北現實有科學的正確的分析，要解放以上的錯覺。</p>
<p>這，無疑的是觀察方法的問題，是目前關心民族危機的人首先要把握的一問題。以下就提出怎樣研究東北問題的具體的方法來；同時清算方君及許多與方君同觀念的人們一些有害的思想，藉以貢獻關心東北同題者，作他們的參考。（未完）</p>

<p>海軍先開紀錄</p>
<p>東華四比一勝</p>
<p>東華與英海軍之西聨足球甲組第二次賽、昨日下午在申園舉行、東華陣綫雖多更動、然控制海軍、仍綽有餘裕、海軍先開紀錄後、終被東華以四比一再勝、</p>
<h3 id="c207">陣綫更動 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>東華因李寗屠開元關洵安等之不出塲、陣綫大爲更動、二馮坐鎭門前、李義臣主持中樞、起用楊人偉任左前衛、賈幼良爲右前衛、守衛力平平、前鋒尙可陳虞添稍弱外、新進李蓉安周光中均驍勇善鬥、戴萬不减威風、如此陣綫、無怪僅以四比一勝、形勢尙稱平均、興趣則甚蕭索、</p>
<h3 id="c208">先負一球 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>海軍因不暗路徑、致遲到一刻鐘至三時二十分始開賽、東華逆風開球、球勢不利、戴麟經送球陳虞添、射門失機、海軍捲土而來、聲勢洶洶、惜不得手、分庭抗禮、均無所獲、雙方表演、均有極格不入之勢、至四十二分鐘時、海軍忽然得勢、伍特福一舉成功、上半時海軍竟以一比零勝、</p>

<p>下半時起、東華振作精神、球勢大盛、海軍處處受敵、防不勝防、李義臣　任意球機會、命中一球、是球在三十碼外遼射、其勢甚、急萬象華邊陲起義、高球妙傳、戴中鋒猛攻、着門柱彈回、戴又得角球機會、攻入一球、惜因越位不計、斯時東華聲勢旺盛、如聨珠砲射、海軍抬架不遑、成爲多事之秋、</p>
<h3 id="c210">連中三元 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>東華咄咄逼人、始終不懈、萬象華左角遙射、打個正着、二比一、東華反勝、自此海軍已成强弩之末、球勢全在東華控制之下、戴中鋒最後復連中兩球、結果束華遂以四比一勝、雙方出塲人員如下、</p>

<h3 id="c280">古人不及今人 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>就藝術講起來，今人未必不及古人，但是一般人總是［神貴古昔、賤　同時。］記得白樂天與元微之書，有［榮古陋今，人之大情］的話。從來没有人敢輕視古人的。請田雯古歡堂集說；［余觀古人斷簡殘編，餘墨片紙，皆有佳處。文不獨在韓柳，詩不獨李杜王孟，字不獨歐虞褚薛，畫不獨在顧陸張吳荊關董巨也。卽器物亦然，不惟近古莫及遠古，卽十年之前，勝於十年之後什伯千萬矣。世鳳之下也，抑何故歟！］這是絕對的尊古派。</p>
<p>自從閙起維新以後，把古人打倒了，大家在嘴一穿出一個［現代］來。充其量，此日此時以前的一切，已屬於時代落伍者。這一種反動力，可算得至剛至强的了。但是我們向社會上靜默地觀察一回，覺得這反動力還是靠不住，同樣也發生了新的反動力，人們似乎都在那裏［攄懷舊之蓄念，發思古之幽情。］這是不可掩之事實，在在可以抓幾個例證來的。</p>
<p>依我說，在藝術的技巧上，不必客氣，古人的確不及今人。單說隠語，像［黄絹幼婦外孫　白，隠藏［絕妙好詞］，何等笨拙！後來做燈謎的，眞的鈎心鬥角，出神入化，古人萬萬想不到的。無怪潘祖蔭想着［臣東鄰有處女，窺臣者三年矣，］射唐詩［總是玉關情。］要懸百金的重賞了。在藝術的精神上，似乎古人的作品，比今人來得渾厚些，凝重些，所謂［古色古香］者是也。這也是根於尊古的心理，不能就說時代的關係罷。</p>
<p>我有一個圖章，刻着［不薄今人愛古人，］似乎是一句詩，做這句詩的詩人，襟懷態度都好，他的不薄兩字，已經打破尊古的傳統觀念，而别有主張。却能調和偏激，執兩用中，不差！這也是我們講藝術的人應有的襟懷和態度。</p>

<p>— 定明</p>
<p>國民政府爲了建築航空公路，舉辦獎劵，到此次已是第五次了！</p>
<p>在過去四次中，凡買了的人們，必然如陰曆八月十五日的望月樣，歡喜的歡喜愁的愁；卽這次以至未來的萬萬次，又何獨不然？</p>
<p>但我今天懷着無限的喜情，愉快的告訴買航空奬劵的人們；要緊抱住［買航空獎劵的哲學］。</p>
<p>我之所謂航空奬劵的哲學，不外左邊兩個原則；</p>
<p>（一）這次中了，下次繼續再來；這次不中，下次更要努力。</p>
<p>（二）得獎成已；喜不得成公，亦喜。</p>
<p>你看那一點水，有來處，自有去處；一片棄子，有生成的過程，自有飄去的歸宿。</p>
<p>就如長江黄河，浩浩蕩蕩，匯合了無數的溪澗，東流到海；海又融合在太平洋一起；太陽蒸發，化汽·成雲，滴雨，又成溪澗，又奔騰地入了江河，循環流通，構成了東半球的主要地系，凑成丁整個宇宙奇觀。變化無已時。奇觀也無已時。</p>
<p>人類的生生死死，事事物物的一切狀態，正復類是；横竪天地間旣有你這個生物，也就很自然地有你這個生物的終結。種種的種種，聽其自然，要把你看的和水一般；尤其是驚天動地的金錢狂瀾，買航空奬劵！</p>
<p>卽使你不能眞個如願，也還可以驕矜地大吹大擂告訴人們說；［我曾經給航空公路捐了若千元建設費！·····算不了熱心，盡一點國民一份子的義務罷了！］或者拿出廢券給朋友，親戚，說；［這是我替你買的！····得了個零分，你没財命！·····］</p>
<p>無論如何，在你本身，都可以說是；［我中了頭獎了！］</p>

<p>四個連長挺着胸，齊齊答應了一個能字。寳芳帶了一些笑容，點着頭道；這就好。我也是這樣說着，和我寳芳同事的没有橡皮漢子，全是伸大拇指的。可是話又說回來了，這一遍大道理，只有我們知道，弟兄們可不能了解，你們得好好的把這番意思給他說着。今天不是飛機來了嗎，說着，他淡笑了一笑，因道；這没有關係，我早就科得有這一着　。不過你們要好好的去和弟兄們說，不必驚惶，應當把這事看得稀鬆，殷得仁微笑道；這個我們自然知道。寳芳見四個連長同心恊力的來帮助自已，心下十分歡喜。又和他們細細談了一陣，方才讓他們走開，趙自强回得連部來，兀自雄心勃勃，覺得旣是當了軍人，就得替中國人掙一口氣。人活一百歲，也是死，性命算得了什麽，而况自已也上過好幾次火綫了，依然還活着，打仗不一定就有危險。設若和敝人打兩個勝仗，替東北軍掙些名譽回來，那可是名利雙收的事情，他閑閑的想着，不覺就在那張大坑上躺下了。可是頭昂起來，正對了那黄土壁子，壁子上所貼的紅紙對聨，一射入眼簾，便跟着想起了自已家裏的喜聨，順着也就想到了愛妻桂枝了，自已在這裏激發了愛國心，凖備着犧牲去，萬一有點危險，那她是怎麽辦？僅僅的和丈夫結婚五天，就失掉了，這事太慘，記得她送到長途汽車站上臉上掛了涙珠，可帶着笑容，她心裏是多麽難受，娶了這樣一位美妻，自已可又不能享受，這輩子算白活着了。（三四二）</p>

<p>— 陳餐愚</p>
<p>前讀本刋吳吉人先生之［寒天保護金魚譚］，深佩其藝魚經騐之豐富。惟醫治魚身霉點，電療旣感困難，墨汁汉療，亦嫌不便。茲有一簡易而又有效之方法，錄之如後，藉供同好者之採用。</p>
<p>在盛暑時，有泥磚數方，浸於尿坑内，三日後，取出曝乾，再浸，再曝，如此四五次，總以磚色飽吸尿汁而變黑爲度；然後曝之極乾，收藏室中，俟來春回暖，以之沉諸缸底。蓋天氣融和時，魚身殆因發療之故，輒向缸上或缸底磨擦，旣置此磚，可使擦於其上；則魚身不再發生霉點，縱已生霉，擦后亦可立見消除。余　魚十餘年，自得此法，天機活潑之錦鱗，不復有霉斃之虞。按古法蓄魚，僉用貯過糞穢之黄砂坑缸，且以坑砂堆積者爲佳；意卽取其滿含鹹性，有裨於魚身之健康歟？</p>
<p>再者，防制嚴寒結冰，可用木製之缸蓋，蓋住缸口，再將稻草爲薦，覆於蓋上；庶幾草悄不致散落水面，而木蓋之　隙處，仍可流通空氣。缸身週圍，更以是項草薦，層層包裏，入春后，卽可解除。能如是，則缸水保無結冰之患。以吳先生法未完善，故附及之。</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>最近有位電影明星失意自殺，伊在臨時死的時候說；［一切都是欺騙！］</p>
<p>［欺騙］是［誠實］的敵對，它是阻止人類進化的一道洪溝，它造成了人間的多少罪惡。</p>
<p>我自已曾經說過；［人小的時候受人騙，長大了就會欺騙别人。］但我終覺到我這話是太槪括了！而所謂［一切都是欺騙］的話，也未免太過分了！雖然在這過渡的時代，［欺騙］已經成爲一種流行的社會病；但是我們不能因爲欺騙的流行，就决定宇宙間没有眞實，至少自已不能承認自已是欺騙；這種主觀的心理，適足造成像那位電影明星自殺的悲劇。</p>
<p>偉大的創造！至上的母愛！熱情的友誼！······你能說實們都是欺騙嗎？我們要相信世間的一切都是眞實，欺騙不過是短時期中的泡影，雖然現世正有不少靠騙術生活的人。</p>
<p>但欺騙病態的發展，和資産制度的没落，是成爲正比例皣　；所以欺騙的問題，也是目前社會上一個嚴重的問題。</p>

<p>（四）尼斯的嘉年華會</p>
<p>法蘭西外省的人民，都喜歡戶外的生活，逢着各種風俗或宗敎式的假節，往往都在街頭廣塲舉行各種的游戲，巡行，和競賽。在從前，舉行宗敎巡禮時，常有許多敎徒，穿了各種顔色的贖罪長袍，丨那是一種没有袖子的粗布長褂，背後掛了一隻風兜模樣的帽子，套在頭上只露出面目，在今日有苦修院中的修士還穿這種贖罪袍子的，倒如前中國國務總理陸徵祥現也常穿。丨丨到如今，還没有絕跡。在各種保存民俗土風的音樂會中，我們還常可以看見種種古代遺傳下來的樂器。</p>
<p>有許多的城市鄕村，還按年舉行着各種古怪的假節，例如Ｔａｒａｓｃｏｎ地方的［怪獸模形像］，（在法國南方，每逢聖瑪德節日，在游行儀仗隊中，常有各種怪物怪獸的演飾。）聖瑪利亞地方的婆漢迷式巡禮隊，和祝海的儀式，聖德羅杯地方的［說大話］等等，都是極有趣味的賽會點綴品。</p>
<p>但在一切法國南方外省舉行的假節中，最有精彩而最引人興奮的，便是尼斯地方的［嘉年華會］。</p>
<p>［嘉年華］這個名詞是法文Ｃａｒｎａｖａｌ的譯音，是指稱一種行樂的節期。本來是一種祭酒神的日子，這個節期，大槪都在天主敎中禁肉祭節的前幾天舉行，所以也有人譯作［祭肉節］或［狂歡節］的，這一天照歐洲各地的風俗，大家都可以儘量地大吃，大喝，大呌，大閙，大跳，大舞。大歐洲，意大利威尼斯地方，和法國尼斯地方的［嘉年華］節，是全世界有名的。</p>
<p>有許多愛尋快樂的人，大半都在二月初趕到尼斯去，專誠去參加每年一度舉行的［嘉年華］會。好條中國江浙兩省的人，到杭州去趕［香汛］有同樣的意味。</p>
<p>在尼斯，嘉年華會是由當地的市政廳和市政委員會共同籌備組織的，其目的在招攬一般有錢的外方游客到尼斯游覽，使市面可以繁榮起來。</p>
<p>法蘭西的人民，原有愛尋快樂的性格，常常歡喜借着節假的機會，拚命地尋快活。他們一到了［嘉年華］節會時，分外地玩要尋快樂。因爲這是歐呼暢飲的日子，白天把街道店面裝飾得花紅帶綠，夜上放射燈彩，照耀得像白晝一樣。他們組織了各種奇形怪狀的游行隊，滿街亂唱亂走，路上可以跳舞，可以用花朶來擲女人，可以化裝喬扮各式人物，穿上古怪可笑的服裝，發狂一般地東奔西跑，攔住了不相識的女人狂舞。大人都變成了頑皮的小孩子，專們和人家尋趣開玩笑，或者用花互相擲擊，或者從車輛裏拖下美麗的女人摟抱親吻，因爲大家帶着假面具，彼此都認不出本來面目，在這個時節，有許多痴男怨女，都因此而結成眷屬的，是數見不鮮的常事。</p>
<p>最好看的，是各式各樣千奇百怪的化裝台閣，一九三三年度舉行的游行儀仗隊中，有不少希奇古怪的化裝人物，例如在一部駱駝形的車上，駝峯上高懸一隻蛇頭戒指，中央坐了一個穿運動短衣的少年，陪了一個拿大毛羽摺忘扇作公主裝飾的少女。在一隻馬頭船上，大肚皮的巴黎男神抱着嬌小的海萊納女神。一隻善唱歌的夏蟬，在哀乞一隻咅嗇的螞蟻借乾糧。一隻猴子大王望着座下的牛羊鷄豕，饞涎欲滴。一個秃子頭上和大鼻子上頂了許多蚊虫。（大約是一個哲家）一個長髮長鬚的音樂家，騎在一隻三囗鳥上亂舞着指揮杕。</p>

<p>我們看到報載一月份的進出口貨統計，入超竟達四○，九六○，七二九元，較之民國四年的入超統計爲大，大家便會不約而同說聲［不得了］，美總統羅氏的復興計畫中將吸收現銀，提高銀價，吾國調查本市所存銀條，竟有三分之二，握於外人手中，大家看了更要大驚失色說聲［不得了］，淞滬恊定以後，外貨傾銷，仇貨更暢，他們的運動，如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，甚至窮鄕僻壤，山陬海角，都有他們的足跡；而一般不掙氣的份子，偏偏貪圖便宜，飲　止渴，或嫌國貨惡劣，寗購外貨，以爲美觀，且有非外貨不服用者；說到這一點，大家更其要說［不得了，］不掙氣的東西；不要臉的奸商！那外國人眞可怕啊！如其談到我國農業，具有悠久之歷史，爲世界所公認，乃前月實業部發表二十二年度糧食進口統計，總價値爲二七四，三○三，四三四元，又據報載去歲各國在華因航務而獲得之運費爲統計，二，一四九·八八○，九八三兩，大家聽了都瞠目結舌說，這樣下去，眞［不得了］，餘如絲業一落千丈，國貨市面凋弊；以及内戰頻仍，匪共猖獗，邊地日蹙，外侮愈，急莫不大聲疾呼，說［不得了］！［不得了］！眞眞］不得了［！這一百二十個［不得了］，十萬八千個［不得了］，鄙人不敏，到要請敎一聲，究竟有什麽意味？敢是比三千飛機，四十噸毒瓦斯還要犀利麽？</p>
<p>試分析這［不得了］三字的意義，其中含着無限的傷感，一百二十分的不願意，而困束於無辦法之中，換句話說，就是因循泄沓，得過且過，任人宰割的表示，但是我們想到爲民族前途的光榮計；爲要奮發圖謀自强計；誰願意自已貽誤，落人譏笑五分鐘熱度，東亞睡獅不醒呢？我們地大物博人衆，箸名於世，英雄用武有地，前途何常不光明；國步何常不可推進！民族精神何常不可發揚！祗是常常［不得了］下去，那是眞眞無辦法，有人說英國人做了再說；德國人只做不說；法國人·······中國人說了不做，這正是［不得了］三字的寫照，所以我們從今以後，祇要努力孟晋，不怕困苦，不怕潮流，不管一切的一切，後個人實地做起，實地掙扎，才有救星。</p>
<p>我們商人，處這商戰之世，地位何等重要，資格何等高尙，奮發的時期，已不容再緩；自命爲國貨界的同人，更是商業中的領導者，［日月逝矣］，［歲不我予］，外貨的銷路，究在我們的國土範圍以内，猶憶日前報載，日人因世界的積極排貨，已向國聨聲明退出關税休戰，以示報復，以他們先進國的資格，日本國民何等愛國，還是這樣積極進行，何况我國？我們不想把國貨傾銷到國外市塲，連這最低限度自已銷自已的貨都辦不到，多麽慚愧？還配說中國國民麽？所以本會於民國十年，創設商品陳列所；嗣後舉行國貨展覽會，及臨時國貨商塲，計有七次之多，近年並於杭州青島威海衛鎭江寗波蚌埠濟南漢口各地，均次第展覽國貨，以促國民之注意和醒悟，復於民國二十年六月在本市北河南路就商品陳列所，下層闢爲國貨商塲，昨天在南市的國貨商塲，又開幕了，餘如南京路的中國國貨公司上海國貨公司，以及其他本外埠專售國貨專造國貨的商肆廠家，我們都非常贊同，因爲這種商塲，愈多愈好，是我國的命脈，那得不看重，至於本會同人的努力，無非是迫於時勢的要求，所謂［老虎已到脚跟，實在没有工夫看他雌雄一啊，不過話雖如是，本會是一個商人集合的團體，對於國貨，祇有提倡的本能，很少研究的機會，且没有出品的實力，在實際上完全靠我們商家廠家和服用國貨的同胞們，以前種種，譬如昨日死；以後種種，譬如今日生，大家一致努力，向前邁進，不管你外貨怎樣傾銷，怎樣美觀，怎樣便利而耐久，我祇管用我的國貨！商家廠家，一方要顧全顧主的購買力；一方更當悉心研究出品如何可以精良與迅速；一方雖受外貨種種的侵軋，必要嘔盡心血，用盡力量，從死裏尋出活路來，這樣雙方並進，我們國貨前途，才有轉機，國勢才能發展，［不得了］的事情，自然而然的逐漸减少，以至於消滅。</p>

<p>慨自海通以還。外侮日亟。有識之士。鑒於帝國主義之經濟侵略。甚於政治焉。遂羣起而倡抵貨運動。然自民國四年以來。總計先後抵貨之舉達十有數次。而洋貨之充斥市塲。依然如故。海關入超。且逐年遞增。爰知抵貨之不足以收效。乃羣起而提倡國貨。國貨商塲遂應運而興。且爲提倡國貨之中堅矣。</p>
<p>滬上之有國貨商塲也。遠在十年以前。時南市曾有一國貨市塲。而南京路馬玉山公司原址。亦有國貨商塲之創辦。卒以組織欠善。皆　華一現。卽歸消滅。外貨更挾其傾銷政策。暢行國内。於是財益窮。民益困。國貨益衰落不堪。本會鑒於此。遂於民國二十年。在天后宫北首商品陳列所劃出地位。創辦國貨商塲。慘澹經營。廣事宣傳。遂引起民衆愛用國貨之心理。而國貨銷路。漸次發達。國貨市塲。亦接踵而起。茲本會更於南市小南門前縣商會原址。創設第二國貨商塲。竊謂際此婦女國貨年。而國貨商塲。如雨後春筍。次第創設。實國貨界之好現象也。</p>
<p>雖然。此僅就滬上一隅言之耳。乃外貨之傾銷。深入内地。内地之國貨商塲。間亦有成立者。而爲數不多。奄奄無生氣。以致海關入超。依然如故。但近來内地國貨運動。合作運動。提倡頗爲努力。故國貨商塲之將來。必能深達於内地。由都市而鄕鎭。由普通商塲。而成爲合作商店者矣。謂予不信。可拭目以待之。</p>

<p>上海市商會國貨商塲。創立於民國二十年六月六日設於天后宫橋北首商品陳列所大厦。初僅有舖面地位一層。翌年增闢爲一二兩樓。本年上海市社會局遷往市中心區。原有前縣商會會址空出。經常會議决。卽設立第二商塲。名爲南市國貨商塲。其組織情形。及面積大小。與北市第一商塲。大槪相同。於是兩商塲南北分峙。對於全市國貨之供應。益形便利矣。考該會之有國貨售品機關。其歷史遠在十數年前。初商品陳列所於民國十年十一月一日開幕。同時舉行第一次展覽會。彙集各地出品。陳列一堂。實開滬上之創舉。中外人士。於蒞所參觀之下。莫不贊歎我國工藝之進步。頻以購買爲請。厥後專函馳詢者。日見其多。惟商品陳列所之陳列品。均係長期陳列。任人參觀。似不能供參觀者隨意選購。爰爲推廣出品人之銷路。及購買優良國貨者之便利起見。於民國十一年七月間。經商品陳列所委員會議决。設立售品部。並指定陳列所下層中部。爲營業之所。卽於是年十月六日。與絲綢展覽會同時開幕。本外埠各大國貨廠商。以出品送會請求代售者。共有百餘家之多。惟以宣傳不廣。且乏舖面地位。營業未能十分發達。但舉辦以來。歷數年之久。得有相當成績。其間</p>
<p>自民十四至民十七數年中。每年舉行國貨展覽會時。均附設有臨時國貨商塲。每屆舉行時期。約均一月。營業之數。終達數十萬元。民二十。經市商會常會議决。將商品陳列所原有售品部結束。改關爲國貨商塲。以下層全部地位。爲營業之所。招致各大國貨廠商。設椻發售優良出品。組織完備。廣事宣傳。卽於是年六月六日開幕。全塲分爲二十餘部。搜羅各項貨品。達數千百種。營業甚盛。翌年。陳列所大厦加建爲四層。增闢商塲爲一二兩樓。（三四兩樓仍爲陳列所。）地位愈大。容納貨品愈多。而營業亦益見發達。本年三月二十一日。南市國貨商塲又經開幕。組織更爲完美。爰將其肇始情形。錄之以供關懷國貨者之參考。</p>

<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>銀價與國貨的關係，是十分密切的。換一句說話，銀價就是各國貨幣價格的反面。銀價貴，就是外國貨幣賤。外國貨幣賤，就是外國貨物賤。外國貨物賤容易銷到中國，就呌做傾銷。像海水一般的傾瀉過來。中華民國二十二年來一個七萬萬，二十三年再來一個七萬萬，二十四年再來一個······不管男士國貨年也好，婦女國貨年也好，傾銷復傾銷，整個的中國要没有生命了。這個災禍。在不十分留心經濟的人們，也許不十分覺得牠的利害。其實牠的嚴重還在東北問題以上。現在各國從事傾銷，當然英國美國俄國都不客氣。就中最當行出色的，還是要推日本。咳，日本是敵人呀。日貨是仇貨呀。爲什麽自疋頭棉紗白糖以至小兒的要貨，吾們的貴國人一律歡迎呢？這不消說得因爲日本貨便宜。你想日本貨何以能便宜？這當然是因爲日本金元跌價。跌價原因當然是因爲他們的停兌政策。然而中他的圈套助紂爲虐還是否們的中國人。自從政友會内閣停兌金元以後，上海在普通日坛上雖老早看不到日本匯兌的市價。然外國銀行尤其是日本銀行是照常做生意。（這不能怪外國人）中國有錢的人一當這百業蕭條的年頭，各種事業，都覺得不易獲利，一見日本金元停兌，料知必定要跌價，所以大家就把錢送到外國銀行。將日本金元抛出。此項巨欵，直接問間接，要到日本人手裏。華商旣一齊抛出金元，其價自必抑低，愈抛愈多，愈抑愈低。結果金元旣大跌，日貨一律十分便宜。這分明是把中國人的資本，援助日本的傾銷。這呌做秘密自殺。</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>自從歡風東漸，倡言男女平等以來。數千年來婦女的束縛，因此而解除。婦女的地位。因此而增高。就是婦女的責任，也因此而比較從前更重大了。</p>
<p>因爲，男女平等，自然男子應負的責任，娘兒們也得擔負了。所以，婦女的責任，由男子平等而解除束縛··而地位增高。而所負的責任··也比較從前更重大。這原是意中的事。也是婦女們的覺悟所致，確是一種很好的現象。</p>
<p>不過這種很好的現象，只在都市裏</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>可以見得到，而交通閉塞的内地，時到今日，甚有依然不脫十八世紀的風氣！卽使有幾處風氣，比較開通的，還不是唯都市爲馬首是瞻？因爲，都市究是開風氣之先的地方。換句話說，就是内地的風氣，大都從都市流入的。那麽，都市裏的人，堪稱是先知先覺。内地裏的人，自然是後知後覺了。於此，我便覺得都市婦女的責任，實在比較内地婦女的責任，還要重大的多！</p>
<p>現在不說别的，先說服裝一項罷。譬如；現在上海流行一種一九三四年式的［摩登新裝］，我們可以無疑的，確是這種［摩登新裝］，不多時一樣會流行到内地去。這就是都市先開風氣，然後内地來學樣。從没有見過内地先開風氣，然後都市去學樣的。因此，所以我要感覺到都市婦女的責任　的確要比較内地婦女的責任，重大的多！那麽，今年是［婦女國貨年］。我希望在都市裏的婦女們，能　覺悟到自已責任的重大，從今以後，要永遠的，堅决的，提信國賃，以爲内地婦女的楷模！</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近全國倡導新生活運動，這是民族復興的一綫生機，很値得提倡的。新生活運動最大目標，是簡單生活，是儉樸風氣，是破除靡侈，排斥浪漫，尤貴乎人人以身作則，自我做起。自我服用國貨做起。惟能服用國貨的，纔配談新生活，做新生活運動的倡導者。否則是洋化生活，高貴生活，亡國滅種的生活。吾覺得最近各省政府確有一些朝氣，如魯韓的勵行樸儉，力戒奢靡，自官吏以至人民，都能服用國貨服裝。蘇省政府，湘省政府，也是勵行布衣運動，訂爲規約，相率力行。昨報浙省政府爲實行新生活起見，自四月一日起，全體職員，一律改用國貨制服，並有取締女子妖冶服裝的辦法。這種消息，都是在新生活運動下所表見的。我國貨界於欣幸之餘，還要希望中央各地政府以及各地人民，於服裝以外，同時還須注意於其他食用上一切物品。好好請客，爲什麽要用東洋魚翅，外國香烟？好好吃酒，爲什麽要飲外國白蘭地，威士忌？乃至一個面盆，一塊肥皂，一匣火柴，一瓶雪花，爲什麽要用來路貨？寫的紙張，用的筆墨，爲什麽要用舶來品。這不但是虚榮的習慣，擺闊的脾氣，其實也是懶惰苟安，没有朝氣的精神改革的毅力。這種人大半都是和外國人往來太多，中毒太深，暮氣太甚，不知不覺間，做了國貨界的罪人。希望大家來注意和矯正這種惡習慣，壞脾氣，纔可以稱得到新生活運動。</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>國貨年已經過去，吾對過去的一年却不敢說什麽。但是對於已經來臨的［婦女國貨年］；不免要來　囌幾句了。因爲事實的擺在吾面前，使吾不得不說啊！</p>
<p>在吾尙未把正文展開之前；先得要回頭去看一下去年［國貨年］的成績是怎樣？販賣仇貨者，依然大販其仇貨，不惜出賣良心，甘作奸商，這又有什麽辦法！愛用舶來品或仇貨者，亦並不見得因［國貨年］的呼聲而喚起了他們的愛國心，改變其態度。最可惡的；那些無恥商人，明明將仇貨改頭換面的拿來冒充國貨賣！眞是喪心病狂到了極點。吾不知他們的良心何在，人格何存？從前唐詩裏有［商女不知亡國恨］之句，吾現在却要替他們改爲［商人不知亡國恨］了。　　假使到江海關上去檢查一下外貨進口統計表上，吾相信一九三三年度的進口額，决不會减於往年的。</p>
<p>不久的以前，據國際貿易局指導處發表；一九三三年份一月至九月，洋酒洋烟進口者，竟達一千萬金元弱。胭脂香粉等化裝品進口者；一三九六六八四元，其間以法國貨居多數，日本美國次之。吾看見了上面這二個消耗品的統計數目，已使吾撟舌不能下了。吾們高等華人的，公子少爺，小妞奶奶，畢竟來得闊氣。他們雖處於内憂外患。天災人禍　扎之下，而奢侈性成，仍舊一味講求享樂。中産階級以上者，不乏席豐履厚之徒，一衣百金，一食十金，尙不能謂爲闊綽，必須窮極奢華，惟洋貨是出風頭，所以年來對於外貨消耗品之輸入；年有增加。［富人一席酒，貧戶半年糧］又有誰能够否認呢？</p>
<p>今年是［婦女國貨年］了。那麽，吾應當請那些；太太，奶奶，	小姐們，一改其愛用洋貨厭惡國貨的態度，而儘量地來提倡國貨吧！去年［國貨年］的成績是這樣，吾們且看［婦女國貨年］吧！</p>
<p>有人主張；提倡國貨，應該先從婦女身上做起，這可見得婦女們對於國貨關係之重大了。婦女是國民之母；吾在這裏敬用一瓣香之心，來祝頒［婦女國貨年］的婦女們，本其國民之母的天職，來盡提倡國貨的責任，不要儘着去追求摩登，而放棄了自已應負的使命。</p>
<h3 id="c295">國貨路與國貨週 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>在［革命尙未成功］的口號下作事，當然要帶些革命性；何况是誰也不能駁回的提倡國貨年。</p>
<p>依據了這個原則，去提倡國貨，那麽應當在刀　斧地幹去。［開會］［貼標語］，［陳列］［大競賣］，已經有［行之無大效］的事實，擺在那裏。這［失敗之路］似乎不必再走了。要想醒夢覺迷，大改厥觀，不能不另尋［生路］。</p>
<p>在我笨腦筋裏，想了幾種较法。雖似激進一些；但良藥苦口，才吃的時候，當然不能像［蜜餞砒霜］那樣够味。草草不恭地杷牠寫在下面；</p>
<p>（一）國貨週；中央政府，是全國的首腦，樹之風聲，最易收［移風易俗］之功所以請在開［紀念週］的時候，規定蒞會人員，一律服用國貨。（我没有在週會上露過臉，不知道服裝是否一律？照理這種會塲，爲莊嚴觀瞻計，應當遵依功令，用國貨常禮服出席，丨丨藍袍玄褂丨丨才對。預先在簽到處派人檢視，如其服用外貨，卽不許出席。工作人員，怕受不出席處分，當然便要迅速改變過來了。</p>
<p>同時，中央黨部，似乎也可照辦，因爲他是領導人民的最高權威者。祇要這兩個集會，暫定在今年的［紀念週］上，改稱［國貨週］我想定能有很大的影響。</p>
<p>（二）國貨路；在外力干涉不到的城市，（或者就從首都做起）揀一條繁盛的街道，指定爲［國貨路］。這路的兩頭，由提倡國貨團體，按日派人，會同警察，注意視察來往行人。如有滿身外貨，招搖過市的人，卽拒絕他在國貨路上行走。（不服指揮，照違警例處罰。）</p>
<p>國貨路上，販賣洋貨的商店，祗許關，不許開。希望漸次肅清，達到國貨路統賣國貨的目的。</p>
<p>够了够了，辦法不要多，祇要幹。如其有人贊成的話，我還可寫得詳細一些，和大家討論。</p>
<p>這樣幹，不但表示了政府實心提倡的精神，也顯出了人民恊力救國的决心。如其這一點最低限度的要求，還辦不到。最易實行的工作，還不肯做。那麽，其他的好看話，也就不必再說了。</p>
<h3 id="c296">婦女國貨年中之兩點希望 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>潘仰堯先生說；［服用國貨，固然是無分男女，可是服用的大權，却完全在婦女手裏。］潘先生這幾句話，說得的是不錯。</p>
<p>拿我們已往的經騐來說；［女子的消費力，要比男子們高上幾倍，不論在化裝品方面，或是服飾方面，女子比男子消費得多，這不是我們男子們故意尋女子的錯處，實在是一件無可諱言的事實，去年海關的報告化裝入超一千四百萬餘元之消息，便是女子消費力比男子來得强的一個鐵證。</p>
<p>因此，大家感覺到提倡國貨，先要從婦女做起，如果全國的婦女，十分之七八能深切的了解望用國貨之重要，而奮發起來，身體力行起來，中國的國貨運動，一定能得到偉大的成功，地方恊定等呈請政府，規定今年爲婦女國貨年，便是這個意思。</p>
<p>現在，婦女國貨年已是確定的了！婦女們，該如何的奮發起來，努力起來，使婦女國貨年，能名符其實，而不虚此年。</p>
<p>作者謹在這裏，貢獻二點意見，給時代的婦女們，希望予以接受；</p>
<p>（一）劉院崇拜的觀念；服用國貨第一個先决問題，先要把崇拜外國，信</p>
<p>仰外國貨的心理剷除，而樹立起信任中國貨的心理來，要養成非中國貨不買，非中國貨不用的觀念，而後國貨之在婦女國貨年裏，才能暢銷無阻，而目前工商業的不景氣狀態，才能因此而解除。</p>
<p>（二）要確認自身責任之重大；目下有許多婦女，有一種錯誤的觀念，以爲救國是男子們的事，提倡國貨也是男子們的事，和我們女子何干？，其實，這眞是大錯特錯了上須知救國是男女合作的事，非男子的能獨任，而提倡國貨的救國運動，更非女子出來提倡不可！所以，我第二點的希望，就是希望婦女們認識自已責任之重大，承認救國的國貨運動，非女子起來担負不可，能如此，才能從自已的信仰之中，幹出偉大的救國的國貨運動之成績來。</p>
<p>婦女乎？事急矣！國危矣！再不要憧　於服用洋貨之摩登，而自陷於破産之危境。</p>

<p>佛敎好像近來很流行。四五十年來民生國計顚顚倒倒，凡人大槪有些困頓了吧，疲憊了吧，覺是不像世界了吧。則求安　，求徹悟，求回到自已本來面目，正其此時。從一種新鮮底宗敎之淵源挹出清泉，以解精神上的枯渴，如沙漠間之旅人，是約略可以解釋這原由吧！</p>

<p>［許多小子因爲嫉妒你，愛閙事，事情畢竟閙起來了。昨見巴金，巴金亦問起。因這事，我爲之不安者數日，亦曾與成慧，質明，貞亮諸友人商量，終無善策。我與你六七年交情，猶如手足，但此事似乎未便面談，恐引你憤怒。你做事能力在我以上，望能設法消弭這風浪·····］</p>
<p>我得到這信，覺得很滑稽。在看到了侍桁君的文章，以及查明了清道夫是那位先生的化名以後，我才覺得這件事的發生，並不是偶然的，而是有計劃的在向我脅迫；同時我也明白了轉蓬爲什麽這件事情一發生，就到處迴着我，以及不回我信的原因與作用。</p>
<p>轉蓬在他的自白中，舉出十一篇他的小說。當然我不必再來掩飾，可是爲了眞相，却不能由他那樣含糊的說過去。現在我逐篇的加以叙述；</p>
<p>（一）牙痛丨是他爲王一心君做的，因爲那時王君想辦一個刋物。這篇稿原長二千多字，我增删了兩次，增至七千餘字，經徐志摩一番指摘，我又改動了一次，結果只剩六千字左右。在改這篇文章的時候，我以吳淞的景色爲背景，如第一段所寫的晚景，就完全是我自身的體騐。</p>
<p>（二）一個兵士的妻子丨原長四千多字，我把它增加到九千多字。改這篇文章以前，曾經取得轉蓬同意，文藝月刋收受這篇稿子以後，他也知道。那時我們同住在善鐘路，轉蓬該還記得，就是跟我們住在一起的錢公俠君，我想也可以證明的。</p>
<p>（三）第六産丨原名據我所知有兩個，一是寒夜，一是生與死。去年春天我曾將轉蓬原稿署上我的名字投寄東方，但被立刻退回了，編者的理由是··文章寫得太潦草，發表出來，反而於我有害的。過了幾個月，我改了以後給陳福熙君看，問他用什麽題目最好，他提議用第六次産，我就同意了，不過删去了一個［次］字。稿仍寄東方，在署間發表。</p>
<p>（四）漁家樂丨原名漁船，轉蓬原托穆時英君拿給現代，但擱了好久以後，終於又拿了回來。當時我就以婺江的景色爲背景，一連改寫了三次，增加了五千多字，我想轉蓬應該承認的。這篇文章曾經投寄東方申報月刋及自由談，都未被採用，後來又經過很長的時間，才刋登在新中華上。</p>
<p>（五）車水丨原名三個車水的人，曾由轉蓬自已投新月，未用。後來我改過兩遍，換署我的名字寄現代。這篇稿子，送給現代的時候是由某女士照我的改稿用打字機打成，這可請施蟄存君證明。這女士能够打字，而且願意替我打，都是轉蓬告訴我的，而且是他替我向她要求的。</p>
<p>（六）山谷之夜丨原長三四千字，我改了以後，增至七千餘字，曾投寄小說月報未取，後在文藝月刋發表。</p>
<p>（七）出獄丨轉藡寫好了以後，擱在我的抽斗裏好久，他自已同傅尙杲君［跟他同住的好友）都認爲是不滿意的東西。雖則改的時候來不及通知，可是在發表前，我曾寫信告訴他。（未完）</p>

<p>— 魯彦</p>
<p>車上的旅客頗有點擠。其原因在於坐三個人一排的長凳，全給先來的獨自佔了去，躺着。因此坐玫個人一排的短凳上，擠滿了人。已經在下半夜，每一個人都很疲乏，頭靠着硬而且直的椅背，打着盹，一會兒倒下頭來，一會兒左右傾斜着，　　地睜開了眼睛，又矇　地閉上。這苦况，遠過於不能打盹的人。車廂裏這樣的人，現在估了最多數，只有少數的人睡得很舒服。這在一個不明白中國人脾氣的外國人看起來，我想，他應該爲這些多數的人不平，或者覺得我們中國人的謙讓的美德吧？然而在我們，却是不足爲奇的。現在擠在短凳上的人，倘若先到，見着長凳空着，也就照例的獨自躺下了，並不客氣。</p>
<p>只有一件是例外，那就是那些可惡的茶房。他們是茶房，是待候客人的，現在也竟佔了兩個長凳，兩個短凳。我看見有許多客人在對着那兩個躺着的茶房發着　怒的眼光來。</p>
<p>［你得讓我睡一會吧？］一個青年走過來很客氣的說了。</p>
<p>［唔，唔！······］牠　矓地回答說。［回頭再說！我幾夜没有睡啦！］</p>
<p>［這傢伙！］一個留着八宇胡鬚的西裝客人發氣了。［這還了得！誰給你的舖位？回頭我去間局長來！］</p>
<p>茶房突然清醒了，立刻站了起來，揉着眼睛。</p>
<p>［我眞睡得糊塗啦！剛纔是您先生要舖位嗎？·····可以可以！］他搬着被單走開了。</p>
<p>［哼！·····］客人得意地微笑着，便去躺正那椅上，很快地打起甜蜜的鼾來。］</p>
<p>我終於疲乏地打了一會盹。</p>
<p>老輩在南京下去了。我少了一個伴。榮不愛說話，這長途的旅行將是可怕的寂寞。無意地唱起恩哥最常唱的［小白兎］，便想到了恩哥和一家的人，反而多了一些愁悶。</p>
<p>那偉大的輪渡就在前面了，我渴望着見到牠。我不曉得牠是什麽樣子，只彷彿記得最近某院長在報告生産　設的演　裏，還特别提到過那輪　似的，則牠的偉大自可想而知。然而不知怎的，火車只是停在江邊與火車站之間。</p>
<p>一個賣小吃的忽然在查問他的碗和湯匙了。他剛纔把食物端到車上，送給客人，便下了車，現在再上來，客人說已經有人拿去了。誰呢？客人也並不清楚。彷彿是一個穿黑衣服戴呢帽的人，他說。許多茶房全替他尋找查問起來。他們認爲只有那一個揚州茶房的樣子和客人所說的相像。但是他否認曾經拿過那碗。</p>
<p>［他一天能賺幾個子！要拿他的碗！］一個强壯的北方茶房憤怒的說，在車廂裏走着尋找着。</p>
<p>一刻鐘以後，終於給他找到了。原來藏在車廂那一頭行李架上的網籃後。</p>
<p>［不是你，是誰！你站在這一頭的！］他嚴厲的說。</p>
<p>那個揚州人不再否認了，只是默默地低着頭。</p>

<p>［没有看到他，］子九回來說；［你們可看到他在舞？］</p>
<p>［没有，］頌塵回答；接着他便旋向依娜說，［聽冶初說，你在爲文藝半周刋寫一個長篇小說？］</p>
<p>［一個中篇，］依娜說。</p>
<p>［有多少字？已寫好了没有？］子九問。</p>
<p>［大約四五萬字；還没有動乎。］</p>
<p>提到了那篇小說，就提到了依娜的心事，而且冶初又不在那里，因此有一種說不出的凄凉在她的歡笑的下面蟜動着。</p>

<p>— 瑗</p>
<p>歐美各國動不動就說咱們中國野蠻，而自誇爲文明人，這雖然足以使咱們中國人引爲警惕自勉的座右銘，可是所謂文明人在這上海，憑我們眼中所見也不見得就是文明。諸君不信，請看報載公共汽車强佔座位，美國婦人批學生頰，事後反稱受傷控告法庭的新聞，也就一個例證。</p>
<p>電車與公共汽車上面讓坐位的事，在歐美所謂文明人方面那是引爲唯一高尙的美德，每一個紳士（Ｇｅｎｔｌｅｍａｎ）都謙讓有禮地實行，而對於少姐太太（Ｌａｄｉｅｓ）更是非讓不可，這在咱們我國人看來也實在是子曰無謂；可是歐風東漸以來，咱們中國的老少紳士在電車與公共汽車上面也就已經［學而時習之，不亦樂乎］了。不料［學而時習之］，偏要［中學爲體，西學爲用］，且加入咱們中國的民族觀念，因此而歐美的文明人看來便大不以爲然。她們大不以爲然的理由，自然是··［你們中國人是野蠻民族下賤東西，給歐美人做僕歐（Ｂｏｙ）的用人，理應讓坐位給歐美文明人坐，且不得讓坐位給你們中國人坐，至於要咱們歐美文明人讓位給你們中國人坐那更是不要夢想的了。］可是那天的中國學生某君偏又要挺起背　骨和她們講道理，這自然是咎由自取該吃官司的了。</p>
<p>歐美人自誇爲文明，咱們中國的高等同胞也時常以歐美人的文明來作自已的同胞的比較，可是從這一新聞的紀載看來，却應該進一步的認識；歡美人的文明是對歐美人自已的，至於咱們中國人那是不在應受文明之禮裏頭，該和美非各洲的土人一樣享受同等下賤的待遇的了。</p>

<p>— 了之</p>
<p>近代文明說是已達於最高度了；但牠處處所表現給我們看的，却並不大［文明］，丨乾脆地說，簡直是野蠻中之最野蠻。就拿淞滬慘變來說，敵人所要的無非是權利，是土地，槍口只要向能阻礙其達此目的的鵠的瞄凖着放射去便得了；爲什麽還要把我們那和戰爭絲毫没有關係的東方圖書館炸成灰燼？炸錯了嗎？不，他們是蓄意要燬壞牠的；因爲燬壞牠，就無異消滅了我們的文化。丨至少給我們的文化以巨大的劇創。這種窮兇極惡的暴行，便是野心的帝國主義者所呈示給我們的文明！</p>
<p>東方圖書館爲我東亞有數的文化　藏，一二八之役，全部被燬於日軍砲火之下；這不惟是我國的損失，實亦爲世界文化史上莫大的浩刦！</p>
<p>平素以擁有四千年古文化自豪的我國，這在過去，也許確是我們的一種光榮，但在二十世紀的今日看來，却事事只見其落後。我們並不仇視舊文化，我們惟覺時代已是轉變了，舊文化將不適於現在的需求。所以我們如想要隨時代潮流前進，我們應盡量輸吸新文化。</p>
<p>［五四運動］說者謂之爲中轼的文藝復興。新文化在當時的氣運，頗呈蓬勃之象。但終因物力和才力的不是，各種文化事業，未能一一興辦；致新文化運動，至今尙難充分普及。就最重要的文化機關之圖書館而論，全國各，地除各大中學附設的不算，公共圖書館，實甚少見；而且盡是規模狹小，設備簡陋的。這還是指大都市而言，若小城鎭，那不要說是圖書館，恐怕有的卽連閲報室也没有呢！以文化事業設備這樣貧乏的國家，要希望其文化能得普遍傳佈，那簡直是痴人說望！雖幸全國文化樞紐的上海，於民十三建立了一所規模宏偉，設備完整的東方圖書館；國人方額手稱慶，以爲我國新舊文化，必賴此發揚；並及文化的前途或將因此得到一綫光明；豈料牠竟在强敵彈雨之下，化成一片焦土！於是三十年來苦心搜集之中外巨帙，焚燬無餘！單就物質損失而言，至少在百萬金以上。敵人所給予我們的巨創，眞使我們寢食不敢忘！</p>
<p>適者聞中外文化界，因鑒於該館之被燬，影響社會文化學術至大至深，特積極進行復興，組織東方圖書館復興委員會，在德美英法各國，各設贊助委員會；又於北平南京等七主要文化中心，創立募集機關，並聘國内著名學者及國際學術家爲委員，圖謀恢復舊觀。這是一椿何等敎人欣慰的消息！我們復興東方圖書館，不只是想爲中國文化事業上謀一新署光；我們尙有更重大的意義，卽一面使仇人不至譏笑我國凡事一蹶便不振；一面且暗示着我民族還有一點毅力，收回失地這回事還未絕望，深望關懷國家文化者起來踴躍援助。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我們ＸＸ織綢廠可說是中國最大的織綢廠，近日我們四千餘工人，因不堪廠方的屢次减削工資，已於三月Ｘ日實行全體大罷工，諒已知道吧！</p>
<p>這一次罷工，純是出於合理的要求，因廠方這次减削工資，心太兇狠，簡直是想立刻謀殺我們四千餘工人及四千餘工人的父母妻子的性命！這次廠方的减削工資，已屬第二三次了。過去。不去管它，去年八月卽已减削一次；爲時不過三四月，今又宣佈將工資再减至七折。廠方所持减工資的理由，說是綢市銷路停滯，工資負担太重，竟把原有維持工人生命的工資，呌做不合理工資，再行减削，才是合理。先生，這種欺人的話語，且看事實就可明白。第一，廠方所說銷路，據經理對工人佈告，一九三三年的營業總額爲六百零二萬餘元，實已超出往年的紀錄，這難道是眞的銷路停滯嗎！而且，往年各分廠，開夜工的，只有專織素機的兩分廠，現在却連織花機的各分廠也都開夜班了。又據廠方職員說，不久，ＸＸ廠全都要添夜班哩。如果銷路停滯，廠方應减少生産，爲什麽反而要這樣地繼續增加生産呢？至於工資，據公司佈告，在一九三三年的六百零二萬元營業總額中，薪俸工資支出一百零五萬元，佔營業總額百分之十八。可是。實際上，工人並得不到如此的；就是假定那一百零五萬元完全是給工人的工資，而四千餘工人所得，每人每年所得不過二百六十元，相當於每月二十元，在這生活程度甚高的上海，這是否可以算多。况且，在這一百零五萬中，還要除去職員薪水，每人每月數十元至二三百元，如此，工人所得，究有幾何！又，工人技術進步，出産大增，所得工資，理應略在增加，這在工人方面，是受之合理的；况且工人因技術進步而增加生産。對於廠方是有利的，今竟以此而及减削工資，眞是不合理之</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>至！加之，機械日趨複雜，工人織造亦日趨艱難，譬如華絲葛，從前是八十梭一吋，現在要加到九十六梭一吋；從前是單梭箱，現在却用雙梭箱，四梭箱；從前均用單軸，現在却用雙軸三軸。如此，現在的工人管理機械，較前麻煩到三四倍。從前每天可織一疋的工人，現在反而不到一疋，所得工資，較前反少。而廠方却因現在的出品較良，售價可以提高，工資依舊，實較以前反而有利。如此，原有工資標凖，對於工人而言，已是極不合理的標凖。然而，廠方心狠，對於原有工資，非但不增加，還要削滅，這還不是制工人的死命嗎！加之，工人萬一弄壞些什麽丨丨斷頭，油漬，小糙就要賠償；改造期間，半月一月停工，工人卽無工資可得。如此，工人所得的工資，實際是極不合理的。</p>
<p>我們廠裏的其他詳細情形，工人所受的苦楚，留待將來再行宣佈。總之，我們爲要生活，每日拚命用血汗來換工資，但是，照新訂工資標凖，我們工人實在無法維持生活了，於是不得不罷工，要求廠方取消不合理的新工資標凖。</p>
<p>是非，眞理，自有社會公論，希望社會人士及勞苦大衆給我們以正義的贊助！</p>
<p>敬禮！</p>
<p>ＸＸ廠工人姚雲仙三月十四日</p>
<p>罷工後之第十天</p>
<p>編者按；勞資糾紛乃自資本主義發展後社會上之一大問題，自來各種人各以其目光發表其解决辦法者亦衆矣，然議論雖多，辦法亦衆，迄今此問題仍未能解决，糾紛反有日趨擴大之勢，以是編者對此問題，不願多說。蓋恐徒增理讑上之爭執，而無補於實際也。惟是此問題雖大，究非不能解决之問題，發生此問題之原因雖極複雜，與社會制度有關，究非無踪跡可尋，因此編者對於此問題雖不願發表個人之見解，然而根據客觀之事實，丨丨指姚君來信，探討現階段勞資糾紛之特性，雖無補於勞苦大衆之努力，似亦非贅言之可比，或可供關心　　問題　　備解决之者之又有考　。</p>
<p>姚君廠中此次罷工，其起因緣於廠方無端减削工資。據姚君云；减削工資决非銷路停滯之故，並舉營業總額爲證，斯固然矣，顧未知廠方此舉要亦自有其客觀環境也。年來農村破産，工業品市塲窄狹，盡人知之矣。外貨傾銷，民族工業勢難競爭，盡人知之矣。金融呆滯，匯集於公債投資，亦盡人知之矣。就一般言，民族工業日趨没落，厲行緊縮政策，蓋必然之結果，非廠方心太兇狠爲之也。姚君廠中，營業發達，卽係鑿實，要亦係一時之幸運，特殊的例外，其前途如何，雖頗難預料，然其不能常此順，繼續發達，固可斷言也。廠方鑒於一般市况之蕭條，營業前途，尤欠把，握於是趁此時機，力圖减低成本，以冀行險僥倖，一舉而獲大利，亦人之常情，如將來市况轉佳，更可按照常規，繼續邁進，卽使經濟危機加深，亦不致過分賠償。是則該廠此次再减工資，良非出於無因也。</p>
<p>再就謀業競爭塲合言，則廠方更有减低工資之可能。都市經濟情况固已大形衰落，失業人數日有增加，同時因農村破産，内地農民遠離鄕井，　集都市謀業者亦日衆。故廠方减低工資實有恃而無恐。廠方往常之不能减低工資，甚或增加，其原因决非爲勞苦大衆之生活邘</p>
<p>艱苦着想，更非出於憐憫之心。其所以然者，蓋經濟發展，失業者少，需工者衆，如工人聨盟罷工，一時殊難召集如許人數以代之耳。今則不然，工人固可罷工，然廠方不期日卽可如數雇集，不論係熟練者與不熟練者，蓋一舉手之勞也。</p>
<p>要之，勞資糾紛問題之産生，旣非勞方無理取閙，亦非資方之居心之過分兇狠，均係出於不得然之勢，而爲社會環境之左右耳。然則勞資問題之糾紛，實係整個社會制芳缺陷之反映，此種問題之解决，卽社會問題之解决，蓋亦彰彰明矣。</p>

<p>爲了李健這個人的出現，表姊不别而行。等我知道他們秘密結婚的消息的時候，他們已到南京度蜜月去。我也曾像害了神經病似的趕到南京，但是終於尋不到他們的踪跡。（現在想來，當時尋到了他們，我將怎樣呢！）就在這時候志琳出現在我面前，她是文姊的同學，我們相識也是文姊介紹的。說來我脫手了一個袁文，不勞而獲一個志琳，無論在什麽方面，都是値得做一做的事。挽且我的許多朋友在邊旁慫恿這件事的實現，自然他們都是善意的。就是志琳呢，也不見得是個不能使人生愛的女子。［咱們男子戀愛的對手方旣然是女人，袁文是女人，志琳也是女人，你和袁文戀愛，就不能和　琳戀愛嗎？］我曾被朋友質問過，我却總說不出一個理由來，對於志琳那樣可愛的一個女人我視若無覩。並且我的好友那般的解釋我聽；［你愛着袁文，袁文離你而去，你感到失戀的痛苦；同樣志琳愛着你，你不接受她的愛，她是一樣感到失戀的痛苦。你想着自已就應該想着别人，在任何方面你們應結合起來。］</p>
<p>這又要說到我是個善於自尋煩惱的人，我不接受他們勸告，而且聲言誰再說起袁文和志琳我和他斷絕友誼，這當然是負氣的話；然而我不願再聽見她們倆的名字是事實。</p>
<p>現在袁文是和我在一個偶然的地方相遇了，那個她寗願放棄了一個愛她的男子而和他結婚的男子是和另一個女人結婚了。我們同時沉默着，望着各人面前的烟圈向上升，漸漸化爲烏有，窗外的雨聲音樂似的打在玻璃上，没有休止。</p>
<p>［英弟，爲什麽不說話呢！］表姊免强地笑出聲來［你認爲是個驚人的故事嗎？］</p>
<p>我笑着搖搖頭［也並不見得，這類的故事多着哩！］</p>
<p>纔像眞的她笑了，她會意了我的意思。［好罷，英弟，過去的事别談。］　說着在烟罐中抓起烟來。</p>
<p>［抽烟的本領倒驚人哩！新近學會的吧？］</p>
<p>［也不見得，不過無聨的時候呼呼而已。］又悠閑地抽起烟來。０</p>
<p>［我也是如此。有時一罐烟擺上整個禮拜，有時一二天就完了。］</p>
<p>像　　　　　一樣和她談　這類不相干的話題時，我彷佛想笑。人類是多麽聰明啊，輕輕易易地敷衍過了一個嚴重的局面。表姊好像也明白雖是說笑話似的告訴了我那故事，但是多少是免强的。抽烟，强作的笑，都是想反這間題的影像冲淡。雙方交換了視綫，又戞然地沉默了。</p>

<p>Official Statement: Fu Zhan Kui Returns East, Deeming Mediation Hopeless</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram: In the 21st year, Zhao Chengshou's cavalry Sun Brigade occupied Shizuizi, infantry has arrived at Dengkou, Lu Fengnian's troops have no ability to resist, Sun is now retaining Fu Li, to discuss separation from military affairs, as a delaying tactic, attempting to transfer Liu Yueting's troops to block the Jin-Sui army from advancing west. Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengshou arrived at San Sheng Gong on the evening of the 20th, after which they decided to supervise the troops in a fierce attack, hoping to cooperate with the Ning army to achieve a pincer effect and end the war as soon as possible. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhan Kui previously stated that Sun indeed had the determination to leave the army, but it required the military branch to acknowledge and repay the outstanding debts, as well as his personal living expenses. Because Sun has always been cunning, all parties only agreed to investigate and gradually repay his debts incurred on official business after Sun left the army, and wired Sun's living expenses for leaving the army yesterday. A certain party received a reply telegram from Fu from Li Gang Fort, which contained the phrase "will return upon receipt of the funds." It is unclear whether Fu will return alone or with Sun. Sun's rebellion has now been quelled, and he has absolutely failed politically. In addition, the famished army is heading west without any preparation. After attacking the city for more than a month, they have been unable to make progress due to the lack of artillery. Currently, the Jin-Sui army is actively pursuing west, and Sun has nowhere to go. Sun's basic troops are mostly composed of fierce bandits, and frontal assaults are not their forte. Disrupting the area is their usual practice. This time, the central government adopted an encirclement strategy against Sun's troops, so Sun's usual tactics could not be deployed. Forced to this point, Sun must flee to survive. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Official News: Fu Zhan Kui has left Pingluo and returned east, deeming peaceful resolution hopeless. He is currently en route to Beiping. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Ding Futing's troops have revolted and sent a telegram to Beiping, expressing their surrender. The original telegram stated: "In this time of internal and external troubles, unity against foreign aggression is imperative. Who am I, Ning, to be so foolish? I am grateful for your understanding of this act of violence. It is beyond words how grateful I am. I have followed orders and withdrawn according to Chairman Ma's designated location, respectfully awaiting your appointment of personnel for reorganization and designation of defense zones, so that I may reorganize. I hope to do my best." (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang's telegram stated: "Zhao's troops have continuously routed the enemy at Bulunnuo, San Sheng Gong, and other places in recent days, achieving many victories. The officers and soldiers are brave and commendable. It is hoped that orders will be issued immediately to commend them as encouragement." (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou Telegram: Ningxia is lacking rice, grain, and fodder. The Gansu Provincial Government has collected a large amount of miscellaneous grains and fodder and is transporting them to Ningxia via Jingda and Zhongwei. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Jin-Sui army recovered Dengkou, Chairman He telegraphed Zuo Yiyi and others to commend and comfort them, briefly saying: "Your troops have conquered Dengkou this time, and the officers and soldiers have made great efforts. The telegram of victory is deeply gratifying. Sun's rebellion has been severely hit, and the collapse is inevitable. It is hoped that all units will be encouraged to make greater efforts to quickly complete the second phase of the attack in the midst of hardship, annihilate the remaining rebels, and stabilize the Northwest. This is what we hope for." (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military agency received a telegram from Ningxia, stating that Sun's two armies have been fiercely attacked by our forces for days and retreated northward. Our infantry and cavalry are following closely, killing and capturing many enemies. They have now passed Li Gang Fort and are advancing towards Pingluo. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Sui Telegram: The Jin-Sui army has been actively advancing westward from Dengkou for days.

<p>Japanese Troops in Guyuan</p>

<p>Forcing the People to Hang Flags to Welcome Them</p>
<p>Building an Airfield Outside the Village</p>
<p>Japanese Military and Political Aggression in Chahar Has Three Directions</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun received a telegram from Song Tielin, commander of the 10th Division in Chicheng, stating that more than 100 Japanese troops in Guyuan arrived at Heida Zi Ying on the morning of the 19th, carrying a large amount of military supplies, and forced the people to hang Japanese puppet flags to welcome them. On the afternoon of the 19th, a militia group instigated by the Japanese also arrived at Heida Zi Ying, with approximately 400 to 500 people, including some Koreans, with unclear intentions. Outside the village of Heida Zi Ying, the Japanese recently hired people to build an airfield, and planes will arrive within days. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This time, the Japanese increased troops in eastern Chahar. It is generally believed that they are focusing less on seizing Chahar Province and more on military affairs with Russia. A certain party received a telegram from Jia Ziwen, commander of the stationed Chicheng Division, stating that after the Japanese army advanced into the second and fourth districts of Guyuan, several hundred Japanese puppet troops also arrived at Heida Ying near Chicheng, and transferred approximately 1,000 local council militias and others from villages in the Fengrun County of Rehe Province to arrive at the area early to arrange everything. In addition to building an airfield in the area in recent days, they are also actively building a car road from Heida Yingzi to Fengning, approximately one zhang wide, which will be completed within days to facilitate military transportation. Zhang Renjie's unit, Wang Regiment, is still stationed in Longmen Suo and has definite contact with the Japanese puppet side. The Wang regiment commander also has a Japanese liaison officer handling liaison matters between the two sides. The Wang regiment has also sent personnel to Beiping to contact the Japanese. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army stationed in various parts of the Northeast, in addition to the 7th Division Sugihara Taro unit arriving in Duolun, the 10th Division Hirose Terasuke unit has also moved defenses. The Japanese military and political invasion of Chahar has three directions: (1) The Japanese are using a large number of Mongolian youths to send to the areas of Chechen Han in Outer Mongolia to promote the enthronement of the puppet emperor and incite Mongolian princes to rebel. (2) The Japanese army stationed in the Northeast has a total of four divisions, two cavalry groups, two mixed brigades, and three garrison teams. The Japanese army will draw some of these units and advance westward from Kailu along the Xilamulun River, setting up heavy troops in Duolun to strengthen the armed forces invading Chahar. (3) The Jin-Chao Railway has been very busy with military trains in recent days. The end point of this road is Dage Town, which can invade the Pinghuan Line along the Heihe River at any time. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun arrived in Beiping, they reported on various matters in Chahar Province to He and Huang and discussed everything. Song and Qin determined to return to Zhangjiakou on the 22nd due to the tense situation in eastern Chahar. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Workers and Public Security Bureau Still at a Standstill</p>
<p>City Still Under Emergency Martial Law</p>
<p>Tao Shangming to the Provincial Government to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Worker Assassinated in Zhao Ge Zhuang</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There were no changes in the Kailuan workers' strike today. The workers and the Public Security Bureau are at a standstill, and the city is still under emergency martial law. The workers issued a statement saying that the strike is to fight for individual rights and has nothing to do with businessmen and merchants. Please rest assured to do business. It is said that the workers put forward eighteen conditions because the Public Security Bureau killed three workers, demanding a response from the Public Security Bureau. The workers of Kailuan Linxi Majiagou Zhaogezhuang Guye four mines are divided into two factions, supporting and opposing the strike. As of noon on the 21st, the mines were working as usual without any expression. On the afternoon of the 21st, Tao Shangming first visited the Provincial Governor Wei Jian and then met with Shi Jinghuan, the Director of the Department of Industry. The organizational plan of the Supervisory Office of the Luan-Yu District Camp Capital Affairs was decided to wait for Tao's return, to solve the strike on the one hand and organize the Supervisory Office on the other. A communist who incited the strike was arrested by the Ma Linxi Mine police and has been sent to Tangshan. (21st Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The person in charge of Kailuan said that since the strike occurred, the workers have not put forward any conditions to the mine. The province has now paid attention to this and sent Tao Shangming to be responsible for the solution. The mine did not promise the workers a daily wage increase of 8 cents and 40 days of shock pay when the last strike was resolved. Observing the current situation, it is hoped that the strike will not expand. On the afternoon of the 20th, the Kailuan Mining Bureau sent Secretary Zhang Guanru to the Department of Industry to urge the government to solve the strike as soon as possible. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The situation in Tangshan remains the same as yesterday. The Chinese police are closely monitoring the development. The miners have not yet returned to work, but all essential work continues to be maintained. There is no spread of the strike to other mining areas. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming went to the provincial government on the afternoon of the 21st to visit Secretary-General Zha to discuss the solution to the Kailuan workers' strike. If a result is reached, he will return to Tangshan. The Hebei Provincial Party Department and the Department of Industry will also send people to Tangshan to mediate with Tao. According to a report from the Tangshan Public Security Bureau received by the Kailuan Mining Bureau on the afternoon of the 21st, the city of Tangshan is still under martial law and will begin mediation after Commissioner Tao and others arrive in Tangshan. There is no change in the situation of the workers, but they have raised 18 more conditions, all of which are unfounded blackmail. If there is no other option, force will be used to stop them. In addition, a worker in Zhaogezhuang Mine was assassinated on the evening of the 20th in response to the Tangshan strike. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Future of Inner Mongolia's Autonomy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The proposal for autonomy by Prince Demchugdongrub, Deputy Governor of the Xilingol League of Inner Mongolia, has a complex background. The central government has put in a lot of effort to deal with the incident. On February 28, the Central Political Conference passed eight principles of Mongolian autonomy. On March 7, it passed eleven provisional organizational outlines of the Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee and nine regulations of the Supervisory Officer's Office. All of them will be implemented after being promulgated, and He Yingqin was specially appointed as the Supervisory Officer. Since the meeting in Bailingmiao convened by the three leagues of Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ih Ju on September 28 of last year advocated the organization of an autonomous government, the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue that has been in turmoil for five months has come to an end.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the key points of the above-mentioned published documents is nothing more than three points. (1) Mongols organize an autonomous committee to handle local autonomous political affairs of the leagues and banners, and are guided by the central competent authorities. The supervisory officer may correct or revoke matters handled by the committee that he deems inappropriate. (2) To mediate disputes between provinces, counties and leagues. There are three ways: (a) Restricting the immigration and reclamation of Han Chinese in Mongolian land. (b) Dividing local taxes between provinces, counties, leagues, and ethnic groups. (c) Restricting the establishment of new counties or bureaus. (3) To maintain the inherent internal organization and jurisdiction of each league and banner. The content of the clauses is generally concise. The separation of Han and Mongolian relations is not accidental. In the Qing Dynasty, Inner Mongolia had twenty-four departments, divided into six leagues and forty-nine banners. The head of each banner was given the title of Jasak by the Qing Emperor and ordered to manage the banner affairs. At the same time, kings, nobles and lamas were used to bind them. Important places such as Kulun and Kobdo were each stationed with an affairs minister to monitor everything. In this way, both kindness and power could be used to maintain peace. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Northern Government divided Inner Mongolia into three special regions, namely Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, for the convenience of administrative rule. In the seventeenth year, the National Government reorganized these three special regions into provinces. The political districts in the province were divided into counties and leagues. The Mongols were quite resentful of this change. What was particularly unbearable was the free immigration and reclamation of Han Chinese in Mongolia, which fundamentally shook the living foundation of the Mongols who made a living by nomadism. The principles of autonomy promulgated by the central government this time are able to understand the location of the factory knots and give appropriate treatment. However, we still believe that it is a pity that the people of Inner Mongolia are ignorant and the feudal system still exists. The so-called national self-determination and autonomy came from the one-sided propaganda of King De and others. People do not want to believe it. Even if we do not forcibly order the kings, nobles and dukes to reform the current system, abandon feudalism, and give the Mongolian people the opportunity to exercise governance, it does not seem necessary to explicitly approve the traditional internal organization and jurisdiction of each league and banner. Now that there is this clause, I am afraid that the so-called autonomy will instead add another basis for the kings, nobles and dukes to oppose popular self-government, which will only run counter to the spirit of true national self-determination.</p>
<p>In the future, the key to the success or failure of Inner Mongolia's autonomy lies in people rather than in the system, in diplomacy rather than in domestic affairs. King De, who launched this autonomy movement, once regarded himself as Genghis Khan. His ambitions are not small. What he has obtained now is a committee member of the Autonomous Political Affairs Committee that is not enough to be taken lightly. It goes without saying that he will not be willing to give up at this moment. Moreover, among the candidates for each committee member, there are those who have attacked each other with King De. (According to reports, King De had a major conflict with a certain member of the committee over the reorganization of the Mongolian Kings and Nobles Representative Office in Beijing. King De's plan failed and he left Beijing in anger). There are also those whose ambitions are not very similar to his. In the future, there will be many conflicts. However, if there is a supervisory officer to monitor the autonomy in person to prevent problems before they occur, it is still possible. The autonomy principles promulgated by the Central Political Conference clearly stipulate that the supervisory officer should be stationed at the location of the Autonomous Political Affairs Committee. This is exactly what it means. However, the Autonomous Political Affairs Committee is now scheduled to be established in Bailingmiao in Inner Mongolia, while the Supervisory Officer's Office is still planned to be established in Beiping, which is inconsistent with the principles. Moreover, the two places are very far apart. In the event of an incident, guidance will inevitably be out of reach and visually isolated. Now that He Yingqin is bound by the official duties of the Military Branch in Beiping, he cannot be stationed in Inner Mongolia for a long time to provide guidance. When the Mongolian representative advised him in person the other day, he expressed his humility. The responsibility of guiding autonomy is extremely important. Since the central government has specially appointed a senior official, it should give him the opportunity to give full play to his guidance efforts. Otherwise, it is better to appoint another senior official.</p>
<p>The autonomy of Inner Mongolia has gradually moved towards reality through verbal and written propaganda. However, we still feel uneasy. What we fear for our border defense and our Mongolian compatriots is Japan's unfulfilled intentions for eastern Chahar. Its ambitions are rampant and cannot be ignored. After the fall of the Northeast, Japan has long granted autonomous treatment to the three eastern Mongolian leagues in puppet Manchuria, and the kings, nobles and dukes are extremely generous. Sima Zhao's intentions are well known to everyone. Japan's appeasement and foolery have no good intentions. However, the simple-minded Inner Mongolian kings, nobles and dukes are still inevitably tempted by the bait and bound by it. If we are not forgetful, we should know that Tanaka's memorial to annex Manchuria and Mongolia originally had a conspiracy to build a [Great Mongolian Republic]. After the puppet ascended the throne, the situation became even more dangerous. It is unlikely that the so-called Inner Mongolian autonomy will be as fleeting as a flower. The other day, Mongolian representatives Nima and others requested the Chahar Provincial Government to negotiate the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Duolun and Guyuan in order to facilitate the establishment of the Autonomous Political Affairs Committee. The success or failure of Inner Mongolia's autonomy will be judged by the advance and retreat of the Japanese troops in eastern Chahar. The Inner Mongolian kings, nobles and dukes once said, "[Military and foreign affairs are concerned with the national system. Our Mongolia is weak and has always relied on the central government's assistance in peacetime. Moreover, at this critical moment of survival, all external measures are even more dependent on the central government." We deeply hope that our government can implement its original intention to support the autonomy of the Mongolian people.</p>

<p>The Second Meeting Passed Seven Proposals</p>
<p>Maritime Administration Conference to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Promotion of Shipping Industry Discussion Meeting held its second meeting on the morning of the 21st. Chairman Zhu Jiahua presided. The discussion covered (1) the proposal to control the shipping industry, totaling twelve proposals. After review, it was deemed inappropriate to use the word "control" and should be changed to "cooperation." The original proposal was revised to the "Proposal to Promote Effective Cooperation in the National Shipping Industry," with the following measures drafted: (1) National shipping organizations should immediately promote and organize cooperation on various shipping routes. (2) The Shanghai Shipping Association should, together with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, request the Ministry of Communications to send personnel to guide discussions in Shanghai, invite several experts, and organize a Shipping Design Committee to complete a detailed report within six months, deciding on specific cooperation methods. This was passed by a majority vote. (2) The proposal to reclaim maritime rights, totaling six proposals, was discussed and resolved as follows: (1) Reclaiming maritime administration is of great importance to national sovereignty, and the government has long paid close attention to it. Please forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for continued action to achieve its realization. (2) Regarding the actions of foreign businesses outside the scope of the treaties, the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs should be requested to strictly suppress them. This was passed. (3) The proposal on the treatment of sailors, totaling six proposals, deemed that a naval court should be established immediately, and the Ministry of Communications should draft a proposal to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for drafting regulations. (4) The proposal on ship management, totaling eleven proposals, was generally passed, to be handled or reviewed by the Ministry of Communications. (5) The proposal on tax reduction and exemption, totaling twelve proposals, was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for handling. (6) The proposal to stop the military and police from extorting ships, totaling six proposals, was passed, except for the proposal to stipulate regulations for military and police requisition of ships, which was withdrawn. (7) The proposal on cultivating talent, totaling five proposals, was forwarded to the Ministry of Communications for handling. In the afternoon, a general meeting continued to discuss more than forty proposals related to shipping finance, dredging waterways, and land-water transportation, all of which were passed. A closing ceremony was then held. The Maritime Administration Conference is scheduled to be held starting on the 23rd. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The proposal to control the shipping industry was a relatively important proposal at this conference. The proposal was originally submitted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's General Management Office and Board of Supervisors and was submitted for initial review. It was decided to change it to cooperation. During the general meeting on the 21st, Zhou Fengtu, the representative of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, believed that changing the proposal to the "Proposal to Promote Effective Cooperation in the National Shipping Industry" lost the original intent of the proposal. Yu Hede and Wei Wenhan both advocated changing it to cooperation. There was quite a debate at the time. Subsequently, He Molin and Li Yunliang, representatives of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stated that they had participated in the review and believed that changing the original proposal was acceptable. Zhu Jiahua said that empty talk of control would not help the facts, and the initial step should be to start with preparation. Only then was it passed. The Shanghai Shipping Association and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were to hire experts to form a design committee to complete the project within six months and plan cooperation methods.

<p>Take the South Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters</p>
<p>As the Highest Military Authority</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources from the Executive Yuan, Chen Jitang plans to use the South Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters as the highest military authority, abolish the Second Army of the existing three armies, retain the First and Third Armies, expand their size, restore the Eighth Route General Headquarters, and add two new routes, all under the jurisdiction of the South Route Commander. The rank of army commander will be abolished, with the division as the unit. The existing First Army Group will automatically disappear when this plan is realized. In the future, the troops under the jurisdiction of the two routes will have a total of seventy-six regiments and two battalions, with a strength of more than 100,000. Eight divisions will be responsible for bandit suppression, with six divisions occupying Jiangxi Province and two divisions occupying Fujian Province, while the remaining four will be stationed in various places in the province. Regarding the latter, the Air Force has decided to transfer the Guangdong Air Force to the Central Aviation Administration. The Navy plans to order the three major warships, Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaochao, to return to Nanjing to join the fleet, and request the Central Government to reinstate the former Fourth Naval Fleet Command. Chen has sent a letter to the Central Government about this plan, and Yang Dezhao will also go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek in person. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Tonggang and Ms. Sun Zhen arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing on the Yuehui aircraft on the afternoon of the 21st. Sun Zhen took a night train north to Jinan, and Sun Tonggang is scheduled to leave Xuzhou and fly to Jinan on the morning of the 22nd. Sun told reporters that after visiting relatives in Jinan Province, he would go to Europe and the United States to study aircraft manufacturing and make further efforts to save the country through aviation. (21st)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Tonggang and his sister Sun Zhen flew north from Beijing on the Yuehui aircraft on the morning of the 21st. Due to a strong wind, they landed once near Bengbu and arrived in Xuzhou at noon. Due to the headwind, they were unable to reach Jinan and landed in Xuzhou, staying at the Garden Hotel. According to Sun, he will go to Jinan to raise travel expenses and prepare to go abroad to pay respects to Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi. It was decided to go to the United States in July to study aviation technology. Three years later, if a world war breaks out, he will return to China early to serve the country. If the Far East can avoid war, he will go from the United States to Europe to study aircraft manufacturing in preparation for strengthening the country's air defense. Although the government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek wanted him to serve in the aviation industry, he personally felt ashamed, and the aviation industries in Europe and the United States are advancing rapidly, making it difficult for China to catch up. Therefore, he decided to abandon fame and fortune and strive for creation in his career. Before going abroad, he will organize a flying club to promote national awareness of saving the country through aircraft and popularize the effectiveness of civil aircraft. He has been supported by seniors in the aviation industry in Shanghai and will set up branches in major cities. Sun is scheduled to leave Xuzhou and fly to Jinan on the morning of the 21st.

<p>Each Declares No Intention to Provoke Trouble</p>
<p>Future Attitude of Soviet Russia Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>(Washington) The diplomatic documents exchanged between the United States and Japan were released today. The two countries mutually declared their goodwill. In Japan's message to the United States, it stated that Japan has absolutely no intention of provoking any country. U.S. Secretary of State Hull expressed concern about the tense relations between Russia and Japan and replied that the United States expressed special satisfaction with this statement and firmly declared that the United States does not want to cause any conflict in its relations with other countries. Both the U.S. and Japanese documents stated that there are no disputes between the two countries that cannot be resolved peacefully. Both sides declared their support for the expansion of U.S.-Japan trade. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials in various countries have not yet commented on this exchange of documents. However, observers in London are now studying these documents with great interest. The first reaction of Londoners is roughly the question of what the future attitude of Soviet Russia will be. There is no doubt that the fervent tone of the U.S.-Japan documents is welcome to the British side because practical steps towards cooperation among countries concerned with the Pacific are always welcomed by the British side. It is generally felt that U.S. Secretary of State Hull's declaration of hope that Pacific problems can be resolved through peaceful consultation and commercial rights was issued at a ripe time.

<h3 id="e27">Japan Proposes Three Points <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is said that U.S. Secretary of State Hull's recent exchange of letters with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is brewing an extremely urgent plan to stabilize and improve relations between the United States and Japan. According to reliable sources, the outline of the talks between Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kato and the U.S. government is as follows: Japan proposed the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Amendment to the 1924 U.S. Immigration Law regarding the issue of refusing Japanese people to immigrate to the United States.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of U.S. recognition of [Manchukuo].</p>
<p>(3) The United States must abandon its naval and air force bases in Fiji as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the last point, Japan has hinted that it is determined to maintain the neutrality of Fiji. If the United States can make such concessions to Japan, the Japanese government is prepared to abandon its insistence on changing naval ratios at the 1935 naval disarmament conference to eliminate competition in building warships. Judging from the confidential nature of Saito's preparatory talks, government officials in both the United States and Japan will likely deny the outline of the above talks. However, representatives of both governments seem to have tacitly acknowledged their preparations. If these talks are successful, there may be further progress in concluding a U.S.-Japan non-aggression treaty. According to U.S. government officials, the aforementioned three points are the highest demands of the Japanese government for abandoning naval expansion. Given Japan's current financial situation, Japan can only comply with the plan to reduce military spending. Regarding the Philippine independence bill, the U.S. government plans to abolish its naval and air force bases within eighteen years after granting Fiji independence. According to Saito's intention, the United States can abandon these bases earlier. The increased friendship between the United States and Russia is deeply welcomed by Britain because it has been difficult to mediate between the two countries, often causing suspicion.

<p>Eighty years have passed since the beginning of national exchanges between Japan and the United States. During this time, the two countries have maintained friendly relations, and economic relations have also mutually promoted interdependence due to the scarcity of competitive products, becoming each other's major customers for their goods. I am convinced that there are no problems between the two countries that are difficult to resolve. As for existing or future cases, if they are handled through proper understanding and agreement without grudges, a satisfactory resolution is certainly assured. The fundamental policy of the Empire's diplomacy is cooperation with all nations, and of course, there is no intention to provoke any country, especially the United States, a major neighbor. I hope to ensure good neighborly and peaceful relations. Since assuming office, I have been working hard on this.

As for trade, mutual trade is beneficial to both countries. If there is competition, I hope that it will be harmonized with mutual goodwill. I am particularly pleased that Japan has stated that it has no intention of provoking other countries. The United States also makes it clear that it has no intention of interfering in the relations of other countries. I take this opportunity to earnestly review, with the spirit of resolving any existing or future problems that may arise among countries with interests in East Asia in a manner that does not harm any country and ensures the definite and permanent interests of all countries. The United States is willing to accept any proposals to maintain and promote friendship since the conclusion of the treaty, and I am pleased to do so. (21st Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>Drafting Constitution</p>

<p>Hirota Instructs Envoy to Negotiate</p>
<p>Believes It Impairs Bilateral Relations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Brazil's Constitutional Committee is considering prohibiting the entry of Japanese immigrants who do not assimilate in order to exclude Japanese who have been working hard to develop Brazil for many years. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fearing the intensification of public opinion, had previously instructed the ambassador to Bahrain to request the Brazilian government to withdraw its plan, but without effect. On the 20th, Foreign Minister Hirota specially convened a meeting of Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, Director of the Information Department Amemiya, Director of the Commerce Bureau Kurusu, and others to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided to issue a statement to explain the position of the Japanese government. At the same time, Ambassador Hayashi was instructed to demand that the Brazilian government pay serious attention to this issue. The contents of the instruction are as follows: [If the Brazilian government's constitution to exclude Japanese immigrants is established, Japanese immigrants will suffer a major blow, which will adversely affect the friendly relations between Japan and Brazil. The Japanese government is now quite concerned about this issue and sincerely hopes that Your Excellency Ambassador will work hard to handle it well so as to avoid such concerns.] (21st Japanese Federation Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the issue of Brazil's exclusion of Japanese immigrants, saying that since the establishment of the Republic of Brazil after the October Revolution of 1930, the Constitution was temporarily suspended and governed by the dictatorship of President Vargas. Later, as the voice of supporting constitutional government grew louder, a new Constitutional Drafting Committee was organized in 1932. The following year, 250 representatives to the Constitutional Assembly were elected, and the original draft prepared by the Drafting Committee and submitted by the government was revised and began deliberation. The Constitutional Assembly put forward many amendments related to immigration to the government's original draft, of which four or five were related to Japanese immigrants. The government adopted a centralist approach in the new constitutional draft and planned to centrally manage immigration issues that had previously been handled by the Federal Government. Although there are no provisions absolutely prohibiting the entry of Japanese immigrants in its articles, there are clauses that may be used to exclude Japanese immigrants in the future, and some people are trying to exclude Japanese immigrants. Therefore, the Japanese government instructed the Japanese embassy in Brazil to explain the situation to the Brazilian government and stop the exclusion of Japanese people in order to avoid adverse effects on Japanese-Brazilian relations. During this period, the Brazilian government continued to deliberate in the committee, which completed its deliberations on March 8 of this year. On the 10th, the government's amendment was passed by the committee and submitted to the general meeting on the same day. A portion of the members at the second reading of the general meeting proposed an amendment to exclude Japanese immigrants that had been vetoed by the committee, the content of which restricted the number of Asian immigrants to 2% of the current number of residents in Brazil. Although there are those in Brazil who welcome Japanese immigrants, if this constitution to exclude Japanese people is established, Japanese immigrants will be greatly affected, and the disaster will extend to the friendly relations between Japan and Brazil. The Japanese government is now paying the utmost attention to the future of this issue. (21st Japanese Federation Electric)</p>

<p>(London) This afternoon, French Minister of Commerce, Lamoureux, and Minister of Commerce, Runciman, held talks at the Ministry of Commerce. A communique was issued afterwards, stating that [Anglo-French trade negotiations began on the 14th of this month. The discussions concerned the issue of limiting import quantities and drafting a new treaty to replace the 1826 and 1882 Anglo-French Commercial Navigation Treaty (which has been declared null and void by France). Both sides have made considerable progress in a sincere environment, and private talks between Lamoureux and Runciman have had a good impact on the discussions] and so on. (20th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Today, according to news here, the Anglo-French trade negotiations have apparently stalled and are on the verge of failure. There are two main points of contention between the two countries. The first is because France demanded that Britain guarantee that Britain would not increase tariffs on silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, and wines during the negotiation period. The second reason for the suspension of negotiations is that British Minister of Agriculture, Elliot, expressed disapproval of France's import of yams and miscellaneous grains into Britain.

<p>US Does Not Wish to Reopen World Economic Conference</p>
<p>(London) President Roosevelt's special envoy to Europe for economic inspection, Child, arrived in Plymouth today and is heading to London. He will meet with British Foreign Minister Simon tomorrow. A Reuters reporter visited him. Child said that he is not an ordinary ambassador and that his job is to investigate what kind of cooperation is possible in order to achieve economic disarmament, but without any suggestions. His investigation may not cause President Roosevelt to reopen the World Economic Conference, and he does not believe that the United States wants to seek the reopening of this conference. This is an issue that other countries are more concerned about. Child served as an advisor to Secretary of State Hull at the World Economic Conference held in London last summer. He will stay in Europe for three months this time. (21st Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>U.S. Senate Asks for Treasury Secretary</p>
<p>To Prove Silver Hoarding Allegations</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Senate passed Senator Robinson's bill, which requests Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to provide a list of silver hoarders, as the Treasury Secretary had previously indicated that silver proponents intended to exploit the silver issue to purchase silver. Furthermore, according to sources close to the White House, the government has decided to adopt a delaying policy regarding this session's silver bill. Professor Rogers, a presidential advisor and renowned economist from Yale University, will depart from America for China within this week to represent the government in studying the impact of American silver policy on China and Sino-American trade issues. According to Senator Wheeler, a leader of the silver faction, Professor Rogers' return to the U.S. is expected to be around July 4th at the earliest, rendering it ineffective for this session of Congress. The Senate Agriculture Committee today approved Punkhearst's cotton restriction bill. According to Punkhearst himself, the bill is expected to pass the Senate soon. The bill has been subject to intense debate for a long time, as Republican senators have consistently opposed it, arguing that the forced restriction of cotton production is the first step towards agricultural collectivization. Republican representatives in the House also hold this view, even though the bill has already been safely passed in the House. Both the House and Senate hope to pass the Naval bill by the end of this week. Its amendments were accepted by the Joint Committee yesterday. It is also reported that famous female aviator Earhart attended the Senate committee today, requesting Congress not to stifle the developing aviation industry with stringent regulations. According to Representative Rayburn, the Securities Exchange's amended charter has been accepted today by the Treasury Department, the National Recovery Administration, and the Federal Reserve Board.

Attendees included Trade Minister Runciman, Parliamentary Secretary for the Department of Trade Burgin, and Overseas Trade Department official Colville. Trade Minister Runciman chaired the meeting, which lasted for ninety minutes. After the meeting, an official statement was released, stating that the Trade Minister detailed his observations on the situation after the breakdown of British-Japanese negotiations and answered various questions during the meeting. The committee unanimously decided to keep Trade Minister Runciman's explanation strictly confidential. (Reuters Telegram of the 20th)</p>

<p>These negotiations will be held in London, and Japanese representatives will depart from Tokyo to England soon. While other newspapers have not published such concrete news, they largely hold the same view, believing that Trade Minister's recent announcement of future negotiations being held has already gained the understanding of Lancashire legislators, so as not to take any actions that would put the cabinet in a difficult position in this matter. (Havas Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Times' financial supplement published an article by cotton expert Professor Todd discussing the cotton industry. His conclusion holds an optimistic view of the future of the entire world cotton market, but a pessimistic view of Britain itself. Professor Todd stated, "The consumption of cotton fabrics is increasing all over the world, which is one of the most encouraging aspects. However, what the future holds ultimately depends on the outcome of the economic policies adopted by U.S. President Roosevelt. After the economic panic, the Lancashire industry in Britain will not be able to regain its former superiority in the world market. Achieving this goal is ultimately difficult. For example, last year, Japan's exports of cotton fabrics were greater than those of Lancashire, which is the only time this has ever happened in history." (Havas Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>Warns Auto Industry to Stop Fighting</p>
<p>Union Announces Postponement of General Strike</p>
<p>First Test of Labor Regulations</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, during this tense situation, once again took on a difficult task as he did during last year's banking panic, seeking the public's welfare and maintaining peace in the business world. The auto industry labor unrest will not develop before the owners convene in White Sulphur Springs. Attendees are expected to include Chrysler, Sloan, and Axel Ford, all giants in the auto industry. The New York correspondence from Washington expects that if manufacturers insist on not recognizing the union's right to collective bargaining, the government will express its labor policy. Today, the President may discuss the matter of the auto industry being licensed to comply with the National Recovery Administration's work regulations. At the same time, the government has now requested the Delaware court to enjoin Weiton Iron Company from violating steel industry regulations. This action by the government is the first legal test of the effectiveness of the Recovery Administration's labor regulations. The dispute between the company and the National Labor Relations Board has now reached its peak. (Reuters Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the midst of a highly tense strike situation, the courageous President Roosevelt issued a serious warning today to representatives of both the union and capital, stating that the President will take decisive action to prevent conflicts between labor and capital in order to protect the public interest. (National Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the American auto industry in Michigan announced a truce today due to President Roosevelt's intervention. Auto industry worker leaders, in order to comply with President Roosevelt's proposal, have agreed to postpone tomorrow's strike in order to await the outcome of the White House roundtable meeting on Thursday. The meeting to be held at the White House on Thursday will be attended by auto industry owners, union leaders, government officials, and other key figures related to the strike. Since President Roosevelt's timely halt and the Detroit worker leaders' decision were spread, the entire area today was filled with joy, because merchants and citizens alike believed that a general strike by auto industry workers would increase social conflict. (National Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) If the final efforts to mediate the labor dispute fail, America will face its largest strike in history tomorrow. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) claims that 100,000 auto industry workers are prepared to begin striking at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. President Roosevelt has telegraphed the AFL, urging them to postpone the strike action for one day. The AFL's reply telegram can be sent tonight. Auto industry owners are now, on the advice of National Recovery Administration Director Johnson, sending representatives to Washington to meet with the President on Wednesday. AFL President Green telegraphed Collins, the AFL representative in New York, today, urging him to comply with the President's wishes and postpone the strike, at least until Thursday. Collins then telegraphed the President, saying that AFL officers are scheduled to meet in Pontiac, Michigan, at 5:00 p.m. tonight to discuss this matter. At that time, he will advise them to follow the authorities' intentions and deal with everything in a peaceful spirit. A certain auto parts factory in Detroit has already started striking, and 16,000 workers at the Chevrolet plant in Flint, Michigan, have voted to strike. However, better news has come out of Pontiac tonight, saying that auto industry union leaders have agreed to a truce. Railway managers are demanding a 15% wage cut starting July 1st, while railway employees are demanding a 20% wage increase from the same date. The President warned both sides to resolve it peacefully, or he would appoint a public committee to study the dispute. The President advocated extending the current 10% wage cut for six months, while also notifying the Railway Bureau that he felt that some wages, even if not lower than the cost of living, were not as low as the minimum wage set by the Recovery Administration. Today, the Railway Bureau managers have agreed to accept the President's proposal to extend the existing wage rate to December 31st. The President is scheduled to meet today to make a final effort to reconcile the labor dispute and avoid tomorrow's strike. (Reuters Telegram of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt mediated the auto industry dispute, a question has now been raised: will the American auto industry, which employs 250,000 workers and produces three-quarters of the world's total output of automobiles, be subject to government control? President Roosevelt, based on the National Industrial Recovery Act, can use his power to force auto factories to obtain government licenses. Those who do not comply with the regulations set by the President will not be able to obtain them. What the future holds will depend on the outcome of tomorrow's meeting between President Roosevelt and the auto factory committee. (Reuters Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>European Countries Participate in Economic Cooperation Together</p>
<p>Czech Republic Ready to Negotiate Commercial Treaty with Hungary</p>
<p>Prague Czech Foreign Minister Beneš delivered a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House this morning regarding the Austrian question. He first stated that there are four solutions to the Austrian question: First, the annexation of Austria by Germany to solve the Austrian question. This solution cannot be accepted due to the restrictions of international treaties. Second, the solution proposed by Italy of a tripartite alliance between Italy, Austria, and Hungary to prevent the annexation of Austria by Germany. This is unacceptable to the Little Entente countries because it contradicts the protocols of 1922 and 1932 regarding the Austrian question. Third, the Central European solution, which is to organize the Danube League or the Austro-Hungarian Confederation to solve the Austrian question. However, the Danube League may pose a danger of restoring the old Habsburg Empire, while the Austro-Hungarian Confederation would inevitably divide the Danube countries into two major groups, opposing each other, which would be enough to bury the seeds of lasting conflict, and would also be a preparation for the resurgence of the Habsburg dynasty. This is even more unacceptable to the Little Entente countries. Since the above three solutions cannot solve the Austrian question, the only viable solution is the fourth, the European solution. The so-called European solution is that European countries that signed the 1922 protocol jointly guarantee Austria's absolute independence, and that Austria obtains certain economic benefits based on the discussions of the Stresa Danube Economic Conference and Mussolini's memorandum. In other words, no country should be excluded from this kind of economic cooperation. Finally, Beneš declared that the Czech government is prepared to participate in various discussions so that it can reopen commercial negotiations with Hungary in the near future.

The second year of the movement will begin tomorrow. Chancellor Hitler will stand in a car on the newly built car road from Munich to the Austrian border and speak to the workers, and his speech will be broadcast everywhere via radio. Workers across the country will stop work for half an hour to listen quietly to Hitler's speech on the administrative procedures for the coming year. The main points will be large-scale construction projects, such as building car roads and reclaiming wasteland. It is estimated that this procedure will provide year-round employment for two million people. (Reuters Telegram of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German Chancellor Hitler and many cabinet members delivered the first of many radio addresses from a car on the road from Munich to the Austrian border to commemorate his seizing of power. He stated that he will allocate 1 billion marks to combat unemployment, and that the government plans to allow 300,000 women to marry this year, and prepare 150 million marks for marriage loans, while allocating 600 million marks to build highways. The government has decided to maintain the stability of the mark's value, and he will absolutely prohibit any attempt to increase prices for dividends. From then on, commerce and industry will not be restricted by legislation. The government will encourage all legitimate businessmen and industrialists, but the government will never subsidize industry again. Propaganda Minister Goebbels also gave a speech, stating that Germany's government's achievement last year of allowing 2.7 million Germans to regain employment has won the praise of those who are arrogant in the world. When the German Chancellor spoke, flags were hung everywhere, and all workers across the country suspended work for one and a half hours to listen quietly. (Reuters Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>Up to Twenty-Five People Arrested</p>
<p>(Paris) According to official news today, American youth Schwartz of New York has confessed to being the leader of an international spy ring stationed in Paris, specializing in serving the Soviet Union and Germany. The international spy ring has been operating in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France for several years. Its task is to steal military secrets and other news for reference by their employers during wartime. According to police authorities, based on Schwartz's confession, five new criminals have been arrested. The number of members of the group arrested in Paris has now reached twenty-five. Police authorities continued that Schwartz was promoted to leader a year ago. At that time, the former leader of the spy ring was still in Paris, but because the surveillance was tight, he was almost arrested and had to leave France. Professor Retsch of the Paris Institute of Biology is also one of those arrested. It is heard that a great deal of information about the manufacture of French poison gas and secret information about French dignitaries was stolen by Retsch. (National Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>(London) The territories of Togo, Cameroon, and Tanganyika in Africa were German colonies before the war. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated after the war that Germany give up its territorial rights to these territories, and the League of Nations entrusted the United Kingdom to administer them. British newspaper tycoon Lord Rothermere (who recently announced his support for pan-Germanism) recently published an article in the Daily Mail proposing that the British government should return the trusteeship rights of these three locations to the League of Nations so that these three locations can still be used as German territory. The reason is that most of the expenses of these three locations come from subsidies from the British government, while the benefits are obtained by German expatriates. Therefore, it is better to return them to Germany. (Havas Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The State-owned Civil Aviation Department's Aircraft Scientific Research Institute has manufactured a new [SHI-5] amphibious aircraft. The aircraft was designed by engineer Shavrov and is equipped with two Soviet engines, each with 480 horsepower. It can accommodate fourteen passengers. The aircraft can be used for aerial photography, sowing grains, Arctic expeditions, and ordinary transportation, as well as carrying mail. It can reach an altitude of 6,200 meters, has a speed of 225 kilometers per hour, and can make non-stop flights of 2,000 kilometers. The airframe is mainly made of metal, and the wings are made of wood. It can land on water, ice, and land. (TASS Telegram of the 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is claimed that Soviet Russia is recently planning to build a huge aircraft to replace the [K-7] aircraft that could carry a hundred people that crashed last summer. It is reported that the aircraft was originally supervised by engineer Kalinin and can be called the largest in the world. When Kalinin heard that the giant aircraft, which was the culmination of his life's efforts, crashed and burned during its test flight, killing fifteen passengers, he was so distraught that he wanted to die. He immediately drafted a suicide note to his family, took a pistol, and went out. It was at this time that Kalinin was summoned to participate in a workers' meeting to mourn those who died in the accident. Kalinin felt grief and sorrow that so many people died due to his technical errors. When he walked into the hall of the memorial service, he learned that something unexpected had happened. The crowd welcomed him warmly. Kalinin was led to the podium and gave a speech to the crowd. Kalinin was so moved that he couldn't say a word for a long time, and tears streamed down his face. The crowd also shed tears of sympathy, mourning the deaths in the accident and regretting the failure of Kalinin's great plan. Kalinin, inspired by the workers' warm sympathy, regained his courage, immediately tore up his farewell letter to his family, abandoned the pistol he was carrying, and resolved to make another effort to build another aircraft, ensuring that there would be no more technical errors.

<p>(Jinan) Liu Guitang's troops, numbering over a thousand, arrived at Zhongdiquan, 18 miles south of Caoxian on the 17th, where they were met with attacks by the provincial army Wu Yuan and the militia of Gu Liangyou. The cavalry of Yu Tan's reformed troops also pursued from the rear. On the 18th, they fled to Weiji, west of Caoxian, where they were pursued by Wu's militia and ambushed by Gu's militia from Zhuanmiaoji, resulting in the death of over two hundred of Liu's troops. That night, they fled northeast again, passing through Guyingji southwest of Chengwu, to Ranguji and Chenji southeast of Dingtao. On the 19th, they were again ambushed by cavalry and the Dingtao militia. Early this morning, they fled to Taipingji, 65 miles west of Juye, where they were surrounded and attacked by Wu's militia, Gu's militia, and the cavalry of Shi Linqiu's regiment. The battle was fierce, resulting in the death of over two hundred of Liu's troops, the capture of over two hundred, and the killing of over three hundred horses. Over a hundred guns were seized. In the afternoon, they fled to the northwest of Yuncheng. This area is bordered by the Yellow River to the north and the Grand Canal to the east. Liu's troops are trapped.

<p>(Nanjing) Yang Jie recently sent a letter from Germany to a certain military expert, detailing his observations on Italian military affairs. He covered aspects such as the army, navy, air force, party army, aviation industry, armaments industry, automobile industry, and shipbuilding industry. Yang stated that the Italian military is centered on the royal family, with the Fascist Party as its backbone, possessing vigorous spirit and agile operations. The army is divided into thirteen military districts and thirty divisional districts. The navy is divided into four coastal defense districts, each with a commander-in-chief responsible for its area. The air force is divided into three air zones and three auxiliary zones. Specialized schools are established for cultivating military talent. The university party army is a special organization subordinate to the party, responsible for training young party members. The aviation and armaments industries have reached a state of self-sufficiency. The automobile industry produces an average of 150 vehicles per day in peacetime and 370 vehicles in wartime. The shipbuilding industry has recently shifted its focus from tonnage to increasing speed. Yang concluded that Italy's strength is due to Mussolini's dedication to the party and the nation, his selflessness, and his efforts to strengthen the country. Italians regard Mussolini as a deity, and his smile brings joy, while his anger brings fear. The entire nation's joys and sorrows are linked to him. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The Kang army garrison in Dengke immediately retreated to the Maliu Lama Temple and resisted desperately. On the 15th, the main force of the Tibetan army crossed the river from Dege. The troops were promptly dispatched by Zhang Worong's regiment of the Sichuan-Xikang army. On the 16th, the Tibetan troops between Dengke and Dege were repelled. On the 17th at noon, the Dengke County seat was retaken. It took several hand-to-hand combats to maintain the original position. The main force of the Tibetan troops then concentrated on Guanyin Temple. The Sichuan-Xikang army launched several fierce attacks, but all failed. Zhang's regiment then urgently dispatched two mortar companies and one mountain gun company from Wuge to assist in the attack. At the same time, reinforcements were sent to the front of Dege. On the morning of the 17th, the Tibetan troops who had forcibly crossed the Jinsha River were defeated, and many leather boats were sunk. At present, the two sides are still facing each other across the river, and the sound of guns and cannons is endless. The Tibetan troops in southern Kang are also showing signs of advancing. According to confidential reports, the main force of the Tibetan army is currently advancing along the Jinsha River and has drawn civilian troops from central Tibet to send to the front to assist in the war. Changdu Garpon Zhen Dongque will personally go to the front to command military affairs. It is heard that their military plan is still based on the expanded military conference held in Changdu last time, and they have decided to attack Xikang from both the north and south simultaneously. If the Sichuan-Xikang army intends to make peace, it must completely cede Dege, Ganzi, Zhuwo, and the villages west of the Ba'an River, hand them over to Tibetan jurisdiction, and unconditionally allow Dagginbas to return to the temple as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to stop the war. All meetings are refused to participate. For the sake of self-defense, the Sichuan-Xikang army has already been strictly vigilant along the Jinsha River and has mobilized militias from Bairi, Ganzi, Luhuo, and other counties to go to the front to assist in the war. However, the Sichuan-Xikang army has limited troops and lacks both funds and ammunition. Currently, only one regiment of Zhang Worong's troops is at the front in northern Kang, and only a part of Ma Chenglong's troops are in southern Kang. Although both regiments are nominally called regiments, they are actually seriously undermanned. The commander of the Xikang Reclamation Command, Tang Ying, and the brigade commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, Deng Xiang, in addition to repeatedly sending urgent telegrams, immediately mobilized the Yan Chen Fu San battalion stationed in Guan Nei to leave the Pass as soon as possible and go to the front to defend against the enemy. Battalion Commander Yan Zhicheng has already led the machine gun and artillery companies to the northern route since the twelfth day of the previous month. Battalion Commanders Chuan Dequan and Chen Yuejiang led their troops to the southern route as soon as possible on the 23rd and 24th. In recent years, Xikang's tax revenue has sharply decreased, and military and administrative expenses have all been supported by Sichuan Province. Since Liu Wenhui's retreat to Ya'an, his troops have had difficulty supporting themselves. During the Lunar New Year, loans were issued for military pay, and each brigade received only 1,000 yuan. This shows the financial difficulties of the army. The troops stationed in Kang have been in the icy and snowy land for a long time, and are suffering from hunger and cold. Although Tang and Deng have repeatedly appealed, requesting assistance, Liu Wenhui has no way to think of it. The Ma Chenglong troops stationed in Ba'an were once without food. Recently, with the outbreak of the Kang-Tibet war, at a time when people are needed, the soldiers' salaries are still unsettled. The day before yesterday, each camp was ordered to leave the customs, but they were not paid a penny. Moreover, Xikang is full of mountains and steep roads, and the journey of thousands of miles is extremely painful. There are more than 20 stations from Kangding to Dege, about 1,000 miles. A round trip takes more than a month. The soldiers are extremely tired after traveling along the way. The local grain and tax revenue of the counties outside the pass is only enough to pay for administrative expenses. In recent years, the Tibetan army has stationed troops in Kangding, and the Yi people have been hesitant about paying land taxes. The garrison troops have long been worried about the difficulty of military food. Once a large number of troops are added, food is bound to cause panic. Unfortunately, if the war drags on, there are even more hidden worries. Most counties outside the pass do not have postal services, and the areas with postal services have only one delivery every ten days, which is extremely slow. The original telegraph had wired communication, which could directly reach Ba'an in the south and Changdu in the north. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, the telegraph lines and materials were completely destroyed. The Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Headquarters had previously installed a wireless radio in Ganzi to communicate military news. Last year, it was ordered to be removed, resulting in all official documents and news relying solely on horseback messengers. Adding shifts day and night, it still takes at least six or seven days from the front of Dege to Kangding, which makes the military command during wartime extremely difficult. The above are all major crises in the current Kang-Tibet war. Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Liu Wenhui has also considered this, but in addition to requesting assistance from all parties and hoping that Qinghai and Yunnan provinces will provide support, there is no other way.

<p>New Japanese Army Stationed in Tianjin</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Arrival of Commander Umezu <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Former Commander Nakamura Will Soon Return to His Country</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Former Commander of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, Kōtarō Nakamura, originally planned to return to his country last month. However, due to the holding of a large-scale military exercise, his departure was postponed to this month. His successor, Yoshijirō Umezu, departed from Tokyo on the 14th of this month, traveling to China on the Japanese mail ship "Changcheng Maru." On the 19th of this month, at 8:00 AM, the ship entered the port with the tide and docked at the Japanese military camp pier in Tanggu. Due to the shallow water of the Hai River, it could not sail further inland. Therefore, Umezu transferred to the "Hiji Maru" steam launch and sailed to Tanggu. More than 70 people welcomed him at the port, including Japanese Army Staff Officer Miura, Consul General Kurihara, Administrative Committee Chairman Yamahira, representatives of the Veterans Association, and representatives of the Resident Association. All of them had arrived the previous evening. At 9:00 AM, the launch sailed along the Hai River from Tanggu, arriving in Tianjin at 1:50 PM. Because they were waiting for the opening of the Wan'guo Bridge, it was not until 2:00 PM that they sailed to the Mitsui &amp; Co. pier in the Japanese Concession and docked. After the launch stopped, the welcoming party escorted Umezu ashore. At that time, military attachés from Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and Italy stationed in Tianjin, leading military bands and teams, along with Japanese veterans and students, numbering over a thousand, all stood at the pier to welcome him. Former Japanese Army Commander Nakamura took the lead, stepping forward to shake hands with Umezu, and introduced him to the military attachés of various countries. In order to comply with international etiquette, our side also sent representatives and a provincial government band to participate in the welcome. Subsequently, led by Kikui, the Chief of Staff of the 8th Division, Umezu rode on horseback through Miyajima Street, Akiyama Street, and Fukushima Street, reviewing the troops. The entire Morimoto Regiment of the 8th Division participated in the parade. At 2:40 PM, he entered the Heguang Temple Barracks. The Japanese residents scheduled a banquet at the Japanese Concession Hall at 3:00 PM on the 21st to bid farewell to Nakamura's return to his country and welcome Umezu's arrival in Tianjin. Umezu will take office at noon on the 20th. Two weeks later, he will go to various places in Luandong to inspect the stationed troops, and will also go to our Gubeikou and Xifengkou to inspect. Nakamura is scheduled to leave Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, board a ship at the Mitsui Pier, go directly to Tanggu, and then take the "Changcheng Maru" back to his country (19th).</p>

The Red bandits who had been entrenched there retreated in disarray towards Jianning and Ninghua. After capturing Tai'ning, the Northern Route Army immediately established close contact with the Eastern Route Army, coordinating the operations in eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian. The two large armies from the northeast can cross the border area between Jiangxi and Fujian and advance simultaneously towards western Fujian and southern Jiangxi. (19th)</p>
<p>Following the Earthquake in Wuhan, a Hurricane Struck</p>
<h3 id="e85">Unprecedented in Decades <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Land and Water Transportation Disrupted, Sheds and Huts Swept into the Air</p>
<p>Numerous Cases of Wall Collapses Causing Injuries, Prisoners Taking the Opportunity to Escape</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the beginning of spring in Wuhan, the weather has been chilly. On the 18th, two earthquakes suddenly occurred, and the climate changed abruptly, becoming hot and dry, almost to the point of switching from fur coats to summer clothes. People knew that a major storm was coming. On the 19th, light rain drizzled until 4:00 AM on the 20th, when heavy rain suddenly began. At 8:00 AM, a violent hurricane struck from the northeast, plunging the residents of the three towns into a state of terror. By 11:00 or 12:00, the force of the wind intensified, like ten thousand horses galloping, like a raging tide erupting. On land, rocks were split and cliffs collapsed; on the water, there were terrifying waves. The usual wind speed is 0.2 meters per second, and the maximum wind speed is only 7 meters per second, but on this day, the wind speed reached 9 meters per second. It was truly a,</p>
<p>Hurricane Unseen in Decades. The Yangtze River, both upstream and downstream, and various places in northern Hubei all experienced this storm. Wuhan suffered the greatest losses. When the wind was at its strongest, in the back streets and outside the railway, makeshift huts were mostly swept into the air, spinning and dancing, numbering no less than several hundred. Older residential buildings were also blown down, causing numerous injuries. Several archways on the street of the National Products Exhibition were blown away and fell directly into the river. The Qingchuan Pavilion, a famous scenic spot in Hanyang, built by Fan Zhizhen in the Ming Dynasty, facing the Yellow Crane Tower across the river, also had its roof blown off. Hundred-year-old trees in Gusao Village were uprooted. A high wall of the Wuchang Local Court Detention Center collapsed for over 40 feet. One hundred and six prisoners in the Li Zi Hao prison took the opportunity to escape, resulting in one death, five injuries, and over thirty escapes. More than twenty were later recaptured, and nine major criminals escaped. At that time, pedestrians on the street could not stand firm, and ships on the river were prohibited from crossing. More than ten small boats on the Xiang River risked crossing, but all capsized. One-third of the telephone lines were damaged, especially along the river and inside and outside the railway. The wired communication along the Yangtze River and in the Suizao Tianshan area had its lines broken, making it impossible to report. Wireless communication was also affected by excessive air pressure. The Water and Electricity Company stopped supplying power for two hours due to fires on Jiasheng Road and Siguandian, but fortunately the fires were extinguished before they could spread. Otherwise, the foreign concession would have been turned into ashes. Transportation in the three towns was disrupted by the storm. Flights between Shanghai and Hankou, and Chongqing and Hankou were also delayed mid-route. The Shanghai-Hankou flight was grounded in Jiujiang, and the Chongqing-Hankou flight was grounded in Yichang. Neither could proceed. At 4:00 PM, the wind gradually subsided, and the weather turned cold. The two Public Security Bureaus in Wuhan dispatched many people that evening to investigate the damage in various places in order to provide relief. The general public was greatly relieved, but the refugees living in makeshift shelters had no roofs over their heads. (20th)</p>
<p>Ping City</p>
<h3 id="e86">Ancient Cypress Trees Stolen and Felled <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Over Three Hundred and Thirty Trees Stolen and Felled</p>
<p>Central Government Dispatches Personnel to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Ping Dispatch: The case of the stolen and felled ancient cypress trees in various altars has been taken very seriously by all sectors. The Central Government also considers the matter to be of great importance as it relates to cultural relics and has ordered Committee Member Zhang Ji to come north to investigate the truth so that the matter can be handled strictly. At the same time, the Control Yuan has also ordered Le Jingtao, who is staying in Ping, to investigate the matter nearby so that he can file an impeachment and hand it over for disciplinary action. Yesterday, a certain gentleman from the Antiquities Preservation Committee spoke about the latest situation in this case, saying that newspaper reports have repeatedly mentioned the situation in the Temple of Heaven and the Temple of Agriculture, but it is not known that 42 trees have also been stolen from the Temple of the Sun, 41 trees from the Temple of Earth, and over 40 trees from the Dawuzhai (this place was the former residence of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, with magnificent architecture, but it has recently been completely demolished, and the bricks, tiles, and wood have been completely sold). The number of stolen trees is even greater than in the Temple of Heaven, with 69 trees in the inner courtyard and 21 trees outside the courtyard (totaling over 330 trees in all the altars, each worth more than 500 yuan). According to a report received by the Committee, a local farmer surnamed Sun said that the cypress trees in the inner courtyard were all living trees that required two people to hug, but now not a single one remains. Of the 21 trees outside the courtyard, more than ten were also living trees. Now the Temple of the Moon has been leased to Hongda College as a school site, and school buildings are currently being built. The foundations are all in places where cypress trees were planted, and the roots have all been dug up. There are still more than ten roots exposed on the ground in the open space south of the northern dormitory. The Committee previously sent personnel to the Western Suburbs Police Station to inquire about the situation, but the police station refused to cooperate. It is not known why. Later, another person was sent to question them, but no information could be obtained. The pine and cypress trees in the temples and altars of Ping City were planted during the Yuan and Ming dynasties and have a history of five or six hundred years. They are of great importance to cultural relics, scenery, and the city's appearance. If this case is not thoroughly investigated, this trend will spread, and the ancient cypress trees of Kaifeng City will disappear. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Xihu and Suchang Roads Will Commence Construction <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Construction Department Has Appointed the Director of the Engineering Office</p>
<p>The Xihu Highway is of great importance to transportation. The entire line is approximately 130 kilometers long. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department estimates that the construction will require over 1 million yuan.

<p>Yang Letian, a resident of this county, has lived in Shanghai for many years and resides in the Airen Lane on Avenue Road. Recently, he used the methods of a quack doctor to swindle Ms. Dai Baoru, who lives in Shanghai, out of 8,900 yuan, and forged a deposit slip for 2,000 yuan from the Luzhen Da Yang Goods Store. Initially, he said that it was deposited in the Luzhen Da Yang Goods Store in Xiaoshatu, but the owner of the store, Lu Zhicheng, testified that it was forged. Yang then changed his story, saying that it was from Luzhen Da in Wuxi. The lawyer representing the plaintiff, Ye Fukan, sent someone to Wuxi to investigate. Yang's original home is Jiangxi Bridge, and there is no Luzhen Da Yang Goods Store there. There is also no Luzhen Da Yang Goods Store in the urban area. The investigator returned to Shanghai yesterday to report to lawyer Ye so that he can report to the First Special District Court tomorrow during the court session and strictly punish him according to the law.</p>

<p>After the unveiling, the opening ceremony was immediately held on the third floor of the association building. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported, saying: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the opening of our Nanshi National Products Market. We are honored to have Representative Cai from the Ministry of Industry, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, Director Wu of the Social Bureau, and veteran comrades from the Party-state and the national products industry to grace us with their presence and guidance. This market has been in preparation for several months, and fortunately, it has received the unanimous assistance and enthusiastic participation of various national products manufacturers. On behalf of the association, I would like to express my sincere gratitude. The sole purpose of the Nanshi National Products Market is to promote national products. The first objective is to promote the patriotic spirit of the people. Because in recent years, foreign goods have flooded the country, especially in Shanghai, which has the most. It has almost made the people of the whole country only know that foreign goods are good, and our national goods, even the good ones, have become inferior. This is really a major problem for the people of the whole country. Therefore, our association, knowing this situation, feels it is really terrible. In addition to setting up a product exhibition hall and the Beishi Tianhou Temple Bridge National Products Market, we have specially set up this Nanshi National Products Market to let the citizens of Shanghai, both north and south, know that there are purely superior national products that can compete with foreign goods. The second is to develop the national economy and the people's livelihood. The national economy and the people's livelihood were mentioned in the Three People's Principles of the Premier. In short, it is that national products are developed, and the development of national products means the revitalization of industry, so that the people's livelihood problems can be solved. The third is to increase the international trade position of our country. I have checked the customs trade statistics in recent years, and the imports have exceeded the exports every year, and last year was particularly serious, it can be said that the ratio of ten to one. Therefore, to promote international trade, national products must be developed, and they must be carefully studied, especially the materials, decoration, and prices must be given full attention. The above three points are of great importance. I hope that all of you present here will work together and keep them firmly in mind and follow them. As for the preparatory process, please ask Director Wang to report."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Mayor's Speech <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech, saying: "Today is the opening of the Nanshi National Products Market of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and guests from all walks of life are quite crowded. This proves the great patriotic consciousness of the general public. However, to promote national products, we should also use national products. It is not only effective through verbal propaganda. If everyone can use national products as much as possible, the dumping of foreign goods can be stopped, loopholes can be plugged, and the country's prosperity can be expected. I hope that our citizens will all follow this ambition, so as not to betray the purpose of propaganda and promotion."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Preparatory Process <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Next, Wang Yansong reported on the preparatory process, saying: "Today, our association's Nanshi National Products Market is holding its opening ceremony. We are honored to have guests from all walks of life. Our association has always taken promoting national products as its mission. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, we established a product exhibition hall near our association, collecting the essence of domestic products for the reference of all walks of life. We have held various industry product exhibitions and temporary national products markets for more than seven times. Later, in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, in view of the influx of imported goods, our country's national products were almost completely destroyed. And with the prosperity of the Shanghai market and the establishment of shops, it is rare to find a completely national products market, so that those who love to use national products still do not know what to do. Therefore, our association deeply knows that the goods in the exhibition hall are not only for reference, but also need to be purchased. Therefore, we immediately set up a national products market in the original site of the exhibition hall, which can not only arouse the determination to use national products, but also promote the actual effect of promoting national products. Since its establishment, the business has been very developed, which shows that our people are not without patriotism, but really feel that there is no real national products market. Moreover, this year is the Women's National Products Year, and we must work harder to promote national products. Therefore, we added the Nanshi National Products Market at the old site of the former County Chamber of Commerce on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, so that the residents of Nanshi area can feel the convenience of purchasing and using national products. After several months of preparation, it was finally completed. The organization of this market is exactly the same as the national products market in the original product exhibition of our association. In order to make the whole market perfect, each factory in the market is limited to one, and no similar products are allowed to be mixed in. And the selection of national products is extremely careful, and the arrangement and layout are all in line with beautification. The house of this market used to be the old site of the County Chamber of Commerce, and then it was lent to the Social Bureau for use. The internal situation was not suitable for business. Therefore, we hired workers to repair and rebuild it, and renovated the facade to create a grand view. Also, at the beginning of the preparation of the association, we appointed Mr. Yang Zhenxin as the general manager, responsible for carrying out everything, and sent staff to take charge of various affairs to complete it. As for the participating factories, there are more than 30 companies, including China Enamel Factory, Apuer Electric Appliance Factory, Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, Huahua Silk and Satin Bureau, China Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Heji Food Company, Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory, Shengsheng Ranch, and China National Products Company. The market is divided into silk and satin department, cloth department, woolen department, knitted department, sanitary clothing department, candy canned food biscuit department, electrical appliance department, cosmetics department, sanitary products department, jewelry toothbrush department, woolen straw hat department, ball shoe department, leather department, porcelain department, hardware department, bronze department, local specialty department, clock department, cotton textile department, woolen textile department, parasol department, handkerchief department, silk scenic department, enamel department, water bottle department, tobacco and alcohol department, stationery department, toy department, western clothing supplies department, etc. The participating manufacturers are all the largest factories in Shanghai, and their products are exquisitely made and the prices are low. In the future, they will definitely arouse the interest of the Nanshi people in using national products, create a great cause for the national network, and give a great blow to foreign goods. Also, this market has also received generous donations from various national products factories, which will be distributed to guests and customers, and the old brand national products Apuer Electric Appliance Factory will supply all the light bulbs at half price. Their enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. I would like to thank all the factories on behalf of this market, and hope that all of you present today will use your usual patriotic spirit to strongly promote and guide us, and especially hope that the public opinion circle will vigorously advocate and promote us, so that our national products will make endless progress and keep pace with imported goods. Not only will this market be fortunate, but we will also have honor. Shanghai North</p>

<p>In the Hurricane and Fog the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e122">Niuzhuang Steamer Runs Aground <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Two Holes Broken in the Yangtze River Estuary</p>
<p>Ship Sent to Help Rescue and Repair in Shanghai</p>
<p>The afternoon before yesterday, a strong wind occurred in Shanghai, and there was also fog on the sea. The Niuzhuang Steamer of the Taikoo Company in this port ran aground in the Yangtze River estuary due to the invasion of strong winds and fog, and the ship was badly damaged. The Shanghai Office received the news and has sent a ship to tow and rescue it. The reporter of this newspaper immediately conducted a thorough investigation after receiving the news. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Encounter with Wind and Fog <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Niuzhuang Steamer weighs 2,480 tons and sails to various ports in the north and south. This time, it carried goods from Tianjin and went directly to Fuzhou to unload. At 11:00 am on the 20th, the ship arrived at the Yangtze River estuary. It was at the time when a hurricane occurred on the sea, and there was thick fog, which made navigation very difficult. The captain intended to anchor there to avoid it temporarily, but unexpectedly the fairway was blocked by fog,</p>
<h3 id="e124">Runs Aground and Damaged <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The ship had not yet anchored and was still sailing. Unexpectedly, it had hit a reef, and the bottom of the ship was broken, with two holes. Seawater immediately entered the cabin. Fortunately, the cabins of the ship were separated by iron plates, so that it would not affect the entire ship. The captain immediately ordered to drive at full speed and sail to the nearby shallow beach, so that the ship would not sink. When it was driven to the shallow beach four miles west of the Yangtze River estuary, it stopped to wait for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Emergency Telegram for Help <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The captain immediately reported to the Shanghai Office by wireless, and requested to send a ship to help rescue. The Taikoo Company received the telegram from the ship and first telegraphed the Ganzhou Steamer, which was on its way to Shanghai, to go to the place to help and check the damage. Yesterday morning (i.e. the 21st), the Shanghai Office sent the Huatong Small Steamer to Shanghai to load engineers, cement wood, and various ship rescue equipment, and rushed to the Yangtze River estuary to help repair the hull and pump out the accumulated water in the ship, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Can Arrive This Morning <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In the first step of emergency rescue work, the two holes broken by the reef in the Niuzhuang Steamer were first repaired with cement, and then efforts were made to tow it to Shanghai for repairs. The reporter asked the company in the afternoon and was told that the Niuzhuang Steamer had run aground and was being rescued. It is expected that it can be towed to Shanghai for repairs this morning (i.e. the 22nd). As for the passenger and cargo soaked in the water in the ship, the details are still unknown and will be inspected after the ship arrives in Shanghai for unloading.</p>
<p>Sanbei's Jianglun</p>
<h3 id="e127">Hongli Runs Aground in Hunan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yongkang Went to Tow and Rescue</p>
<p>Still Unable to Haul Out</p>
<p>Sanbei Company's Hunan shipping industry is the crown of the six companies. There are currently four Hong-character Jianglun ships that travel back and forth. This time, the Hongli ship transported goods from Shanghai to Hunan, which was the first ship to Changsha after the upstream water rose. The goods carried by Hongli were mostly cotton yarn. The ship's draft was very shallow, and the load was only about eight feet, so it seemed that it could pass without any problems this time to Hunan.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Ship Runs Aground <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the ship suddenly ran aground on the river near the lower mud port near Changsha. The hull was deeply mired in the sand. The captain tried every means on the spot, but could not escape from the shallow beach. He had to send a telegram to Changsha and Hankou to request a ship to rescue. The place where Honghe ran aground was considered to hinder the Changsha waterway. Therefore, after the accident, the Changsha Customs also sent personnel to monitor the towing and rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Sent a Ship to Rescue <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Hankou Branch received the report and immediately telegraphed Shanghai and immediately sent the Yongkang ship to tow. The Yongkang ship used the thickest and strongest steel wire rope to put on Hongli, and Yongkang towed it at full speed. But Hongli was heavily loaded and mired in the mud, and was aground very deeply. It was impossible to tow it out for a while. When it tried its best to pull forward, the steel wire rope was broken, and Hongli still could not be rescued.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Haul Out After Discharging <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Now the cargo owners in central Hunan, because the goods in the Hongli ship have been blocked on the ship for a long time, hinder the market business, so the cargo gangs and the Sanbei Company Branch consulted and decided to unload the cargo in the Hongli ship onto barges first and transport them to Changsha. Now the Yongkang ship is sent to tow five barges to Xiani Port, to the side of Hongli, first unload the cargo inside the ship and transport it to Hunan, and then wait for the water to rise before towing and rescuing.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Fulong Damaged <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The company received a telegram from Nanjing yesterday that when the Fulong ship was docked at the company's wharf in Beijing, the Changan ship, which was used for dispatch, was also berthed outside the wharf. At that time, the northwest wind was very strong, and the tide was high. The hull of the Changan ship squeezed into Fulong. At that time, the cabins, stairs, etc. of Fulong were all damaged, and the anchor chain was also broken, and the iron anchor fell into the water. This matter has been discussed and resolved peacefully by the office of the ship management office and the Beijing office of Sanbei Company.</p>

<p>Public Concession Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e133">Resolved to Rectify Rickshaw Measures <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Adopted the Recommendations of the Joint Meeting of the Police and Transportation Committees</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Board of Directors meeting on the afternoon of March 21 discussed the joint meeting of the Police and Transportation Committees. It drafted measures to rectify rickshaws and decided to adopt the recommendations of the joint meeting to establish a rickshaw management office, and appoint two Chinese staff and one foreign staff to be responsible for it. The powers of the office are to report to the Board of Directors, cancel or issue (to groups or individuals) rickshaw licenses. The number of public rickshaw licenses is still limited to 10,000. It also has the power to issue or cancel rickshaw puller licenses. The number of public rickshaw pullers is limited to four times the number of rickshaws. For private rickshaws, one person per rickshaw, and cannot issue more without sufficient reason. Regarding the fourth to sixteenth recommendations of the Investigation Committee, which have been reviewed and approved by the joint meeting, are now adopted by the Board of Directors as follows: 1. The management office may make suggestions at any time to gradually reduce the number of licenses. 2. The rickshaw owner registration book, as recently compiled, should be put into effect immediately. 3. Both public and private rickshaw pullers should be licensed, and the methods should be drafted and implemented immediately. 4. The maximum rent for public rickshaws is eight dimes per 24 hours, and pro rata for less than 24 hours. The rent schedule is to be drafted by the Public Works Bureau. The license regulations should stipulate that the rent is not allowed to exceed the amount allowed by the Public Works Bureau. 5. The fare should be two dimes per mile and six dimes per hour. The fare schedule should be posted in a conspicuous place on the rickshaw. 6. Public rickshaws should be improved immediately. 7. Vehicle inspection should be carried out more strictly than before. 8. The rickshaw lamps should be thoroughly improved. 9. Rickshaw parking places should be set up at convenient locations in various places, and regulations should be formulated. Anyone who hires a rickshaw must strictly follow the order of hiring. 10. Before changing the methods, regarding the rickshaw puller license regulations, the current public and private rickshaw license regulations, and the methods and time of issuing licenses, should be reviewed by the relevant departments of the Public Works Bureau and reported to the Board of Directors for implementation. 11. Those who hold a private rickshaw license should indicate the vehicle number and their name on the rickshaw puller's license. If the rickshaw puller is changed, it should be re-indicated immediately. 12. The police department should continue to crack down on "wild chicken" chartered cars. 13. The Public Works Bureau should contact the French Concession and the municipal government authorities to cooperate in order to improve the conditions of public rickshaws.</p>
<p>The committee also suggested that the Public Works Bureau should clearly state that all rickshaw licenses and magnetic badges are the property of the Bureau in perpetuity and are only lent to the license holders for use on a timely basis. Any private sale of licenses will not be recognized. Any transfer of licensed rickshaws must be approved and registered by the Bureau. Rickshaw owners who wish to cease operations must report to the Public Works Bureau. All applications for continued licensing must be considered by the Bureau. This proposal was also adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The Investigation Committee found that passengers often ask rickshaw pullers to wait in the central district, but regulations do not allow parking, so the rickshaw pullers may not be able to get their fare or may be interfered with by the patrolmen due to stopping. This behavior puts the rickshaw pullers in a difficult position. The public should be notified to pay the fare immediately upon alighting. This suggestion was also adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Explanation of Rent Reduction Opinions <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Yin Zhiling, Liang Yangting, Gu Songmao, Xia Muyao, and Zhu He Gao, the executive directors of the Rickshaw Association's Special Zone Office, submitted a document to the Public Works Bureau, stating: "In order to consider the fundamentals, we have drafted a reduced rent schedule and attached rickshaw industry forms, requesting your review. We have previously submitted a report from the Bureau's Vehicle Committee, and in addition to questioning the suggestions, we have paid attention to and prepared for all the reform and improvement items. As for the rent reduction, we have now collected opinions and listed the vehicle costs and operating income items separately as forms, and discussed them repeatedly. The existing rent really needs to be reduced, but we are afraid that the amount proposed by the Vehicle Committee will be difficult to implement. Therefore, based on a compromise method, we have drafted that the daily rent for public rickshaws will be reduced to twelve dimes in the future, as a way to consider the fundamentals. Therefore, we explain it as follows: (1) Appropriately reducing the rent is not only the demand of the rickshaw pullers, but also recognized by the rickshaw owners. However, helping rickshaw pullers is not entirely about reducing the fare, but about increasing their intelligence. It is found that when rickshaw pullers earn a fare, they will definitely spend it all, and when they earn very little, they will definitely use old tricks to owe rent to the contractors. The nature is like this, the habit is like this, everyone knows it. At best, even if the rent is not charged, it is impossible to save money. (2) If the daily rent is actually reduced to eight dimes, the position of the contractor should be removed. The rickshaw owners and the contractors have contracts with a fixed term of years, which should be legally binding and cannot be changed halfway. Even if we take a step back and allow them to be eliminated, the contractors have no business to run. The rickshaw pullers usually borrow money and owe rent, and they will definitely be pursued one by one. The places where they usually live will definitely be evicted immediately. If the rickshaw pullers cannot cope with it for a while, it is inevitable that unnecessary disputes will arise. In short, reducing the rent is originally an urgent task. If we do not consider everything and go our own way, it will not only be unfavorable to the rickshaw owners and foremen, but also there will be various difficulties for the rickshaw pullers. Therefore, the association, in the midst of a compromise rent reduction, is building hospitals to treat the rickshaw pullers' illnesses, building new villages to make the rickshaw pullers live comfortably, and making model rickshaws to make it easier for them to pull, and setting up training centers to increase their knowledge, and all other matters that should be set up and prepared are gradually carried out. Once it is completed one day, the actual effect will be fully achieved, then it will not be difficult for the rickshaw pullers to pull the rickshaw directly to the rickshaw owners. Once the rickshaw pullers can pull the rickshaw directly, the rent price proposed by the Vehicle Committee will be realized at that time, which is a natural trend and there is nothing to worry about. If we want to implement this rent price immediately, it is not only impossible to take care of both the standard and the original, but also if we use it to help the rickshaw pullers, we are afraid that it will only be a name but not thorough. We have specially listed the reasons for drafting the daily rent reduction to twelve dimes, and the vehicle costs and operating income items separately as forms, and submitted a document to request your review. If there is anything appropriate, we ask you to reply and follow."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Warned Qinfeng Factory Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Factory Requested the Machinery Association to Intervene According to Law</p>
<p>Qinfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 546 Baoding Road has a considerable history in the dyeing and weaving industry run by Chinese people. The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession suddenly sent a letter to the factory yesterday, saying that all the internal equipment of the factory did not meet the requirements for factory use, such as the facilities in the boiler room, raw material room, and weaving places, which were detrimental to public safety. In order to take care of public safety, it should immediately find ways to improve it, otherwise move out to maintain safety, etc. After receiving this warning letter, the factory believed that when the factory was first established, it must first be reviewed by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Bureau. Only after the review was suitable could it be opened. Now that the Public Works Bureau has approved it in the past, how can it be said that it is not suitable? It immediately requested the Federation of Mechanical National Products Factories to intervene according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e141">General Assembly Declaration <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The association also issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "A country cannot stand without its people, and the people cannot progress without unity. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'Our people are like a heap of loose sand. Without organization, how can we survive?' Alas, if all the people of our country can understand this principle, then it is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. The citizens of Shanghai have been bathed in the culture of civilization for the longest time and have undergone the tempering of revolution for a long time. Everyone is willing to make every effort for the benefit of the country and the people, and they will also not hesitate to sacrifice everything to resist those who invade our land and sovereignty and seize our property and lives. During the 'January 28th' Incident, this association once organized a citizens' volunteer army to bravely fight against the enemy, and organized refugee shelters to help the poor. Other examples include enthusiastically donating goods and supplies, wholeheartedly providing vehicles and clothing, assisting military affairs, maintaining the market, regulating finance, and mediating commercial affairs. All the facts have long been made clear to the world. Although it can be said that it is the inherent duty of our people, it is also sufficient to prove the association's pragmatism and willingness to sacrifice. However, in recent days, people's livelihoods have become more difficult, the country's steps have become more difficult, foreign disasters have been frequent, and internal strife has not ended. The covenant of the League of Nations is as if it does not exist. Arrogant and powerful neighbors have become the hosts and seized the territory. The lost territory in the Northeast has not been recovered, and the unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet has come again. Chen Jigong has retreated to southern Fujian, and Sun Dianying has risen again in Ningxia. Foreign goods are dumped, and the agricultural villages in various provinces have gone bankrupt. National goods are sluggish, and the Shanghai market is even more depressed. Alas, we, looking at the state affairs, already feel extremely frightened. Can Shanghai, which claims to be the richest in the country, still witness its demise and not help each other? Now, the third representative assembly of this association has been established in accordance with the regulations. Learning from the past, strengthening unity, burning our boats, and having no turning back, we will uphold the friendship of helping each other in the same boat, show the sincerity of saving ourselves and others, support the government, promote people's livelihood, lead public opinion of citizens, complete the foundation of autonomy for the country, and restore the prosperous city. Therefore, we declare our intentions and hope that all compatriots and gentlemen will carefully consider them."</p>
<p>American Aviator</p>
<h3 id="e142">Hawke Returns to Shanghai from Guangzhou <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Arriving around noon today</p>
<p>American aviator Mr. Hawke previously traveled from Shanghai to Guangzhou on a China National Aviation Corporation plane to negotiate aircraft procurement issues with the Guangzhou authorities. Having completed his business, he returned to Shanghai by the same airline yesterday morning, arriving in Fuzhou in the evening. He is scheduled to fly from Fuzhou to Shanghai this morning and is expected to arrive at Longhua Airport around noon. It is also learned that the Inspector General of Customs</p>
<h3 id="e143">Mr. Maze Requests Leave to Return Home <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Departing April 1st</p>
<p>Mr. Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, has been in office for over ten years and has had no spare time to return home once. Due to the recent heavy workload and mental exhaustion, he urgently needs to return home for a short rest. Therefore, he has specially requested the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance for six months' leave, which has been approved by the authorities. He will take a ship back to England on April 1st to visit relatives and take care of personal affairs. In 1927, while serving as the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Maze once requested leave to return home. However, due to his important position and the lack of a suitable replacement, it was not approved. Since Mr. Maze took office as the Inspector General of Customs in 1929, his official duties have become even more numerous and pressing. Now that the national customs administration has entered a regular track, and each department has its own commander, he is taking the time to rest. Although Mr. Maze is a foreign advisor, since his promotion to important positions, he has eliminated the previous abuses of foreign power over Chinese authority. All customs personnel and administration are under the command of the Chinese government. He focuses on handling matters within his duties, planning carefully, and implementing necessary reforms without complaint. Therefore, customs revenue has increased several times compared to the past, and domestic and foreign credit has been maintained, which is relied upon by China's finances. In the past two years, he personally went to various places to investigate and prevent smuggling, which has greatly benefited the national treasury. Other achievements include the improvement of the treatment of Chinese employees and the equal status of Chinese and foreign employees. Many Chinese officials have been promoted to important positions, all thanks to Mr. Maze's leadership. Currently, while Mr. Maze is on leave to return home, his duties will be temporarily assumed by Mr. Rocherfort, the current Customs Commissioner of the General Affairs Department. The position of the General Affairs Department will be assumed by Mr. Ding Guitang, the current Chinese Secretary. The position of Chinese Secretary will be assumed by Mr. Lu Bin, who is currently in the United States studying the customs administrative system. Mr. Lu has been summoned to return home and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early April.</p>
<p>After Mr. Hawke arrives in Shanghai, he will go to Hangzhou to fly the Condor aircraft he brought from the United States, perform in Shanghai, and make a long-distance flight between Shanghai and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Two Railways Preparing</p>
<h3 id="e144">Health Campaign Conference <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways ordered all national railways to hold a health campaign conference on April 1st each year in accordance with the regulations issued by the ministry. Both railways immediately established a preparatory committee, with representatives from the relevant departments and offices attending. Pu Dengqing, Chen Mingshou, Yu Shouchang, Li Xun, and Huang Zifang were elected as preparatory committee members, and Huang Zifang was elected as the standing committee member. Five groups were established under it: general affairs, cleaning, inspection, health care, each with one group leader. The personnel and planned work of each group are allocated as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e147">Cigarette Factory Conference Revises Tax Rate <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since the Zhongmin Cigarette Company and others proposed the revision of the tax rate, there has been no concrete plan, which has caused many misunderstandings from all parties. The cigarette factory industry is also in a state of anxiety. Previously, the industry association convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members to discuss the plan. It was resolved to send a letter to the proposer Huang Ziping, asking him to quickly summarize the opinions of the proposal, draft a practical plan, and then pass it on to the next executive and supervisory committee meeting for discussion, so that it can be submitted to the government to ensure that tax revenue is not reduced and that Chinese factories can receive real benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Shanghai Yearbook Publication Postponed <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The first Shanghai Yearbook (1933) was highly praised by all parties. The second (1934 edition) has been thoroughly revised and was originally scheduled for publication at the end of March. Now, the Shanghai Yearbook Society has issued a notice postponing the publication date to the end of April. According to the editors of the society, the reason for the delay is that after various manuscripts were typeset, various new materials were continuously searched. In order to seek new and accurate results, the editors successively withdrew the manuscripts from the printing house for addition and replacement. Many special contributors also acted cautiously and repeatedly withdrew the original manuscripts for revision, resulting in slowness in typesetting. In addition, because the page numbers of each column in the first yearbook were listed separately, it was inconvenient to check. This time, the total page number of the entire book is increased, which must be completely typeset before the code can be printed, which is also one of the reasons for the slow publication.</p>
<p>Machinery Association Petitions the Ministry of Railways</p>
<h3 id="e149">Correcting the Discrepancies in Freight Charges on Two Railways <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Same Steel Enamelware</p>
<p>Shipping to Beijing is More Expensive than Shipping to Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-made National Goods Factory Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: "We are presenting a matter regarding the discrepancies in freight charges on the two railways, please correct. We have found that the steel enamelware manufactured by the factories of the association members, the freight from Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Hangzhou is calculated according to the third-class product per kilogram. If it is transported from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to Beijing, it must be calculated according to the second-class product per meter, resulting in a sudden increase in freight by more than double. Both are state-owned railways under the jurisdiction of your ministry, but the grading of goods is different, and the discrepancy in freight is so great. Moreover, since the joint transportation was completed, each box of steel enamelware transported from Shanghai to Qingdao, if handed over to the railway for joint transportation, costs 19 yuan, and it only costs 5 yuan for sea transportation by foreign ships. The association is a national goods organization and will definitely support the development of joint transportation, hoping to reduce leakage. We usually repeatedly urge the member factories not to hand over transportation to foreign ships in order to comply with the principle of national goods being transported by the nation. However, in terms of freight, the foreign transportation is so light and the railway is so heavy. The discrepancies in freight and the different grading between the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are even more shocking. It is reasonable to prepare a document for presentation, requesting your ministry to review and correct it, so as to benefit the railway transportation of national goods and avoid foreign ships encroaching, which is truly for the public convenience."</p>

<h3 id="e150">Requesting the Municipal Party Department to Resolve <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Allowing the Continued Establishment of the Trade Association</p>
<p>Refuting the Illegal Organization of the Trade Union</p>
<p>The Shanghai Barber Industry Trade Association, prepared in accordance with the law, has submitted the roster and articles of association of the Dong Huo partnership to the party and government agencies for recordation. On March 16th, a founding assembly was held at the Barber Guild Hall, and the Municipal Party Department specially dispatched Zhang Dafu to attend for guidance. Due to various misunderstandings, the instructor stopped the meeting. On the 19th of this month, store owner representatives Xue Guangdian and Qian Shuling, and store employee representatives Wei Guoyi, Hang Yongjiang, and Xia Mingqing, etc., stated to the Municipal Party Department the necessity of Dong Huo cooperation in the barber industry and the past disputes of Dong Huo separation. Subsequently, the acting director of the Civil Movement Department, Zhang Sheng, received them and believed that the industry's situation was special, allowing shop assistants to participate in the trade association and promising to continue the establishment in the shortest possible time. At the same time, three representatives sent by unemployed persons in the barber industry in the South Shanghai District requested the revival of the trade union in the district. The acting director Zhang refuted the illegal organization of the trade union and ordered the old-issued badges to be quickly submitted for verification and cancellation in order to comply with the law.</p>

<p>Appointing Ke Ganchen as Director</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the Nanshi area is vast, commercial affairs are increasingly complex, and local shops often encounter disputes with the Public Security District Office, Stamp Tax Bureau, etc., and appealing to the chamber is too slow.</p>
<p>The proposal by Luo Qinghua, director of the Commercial Affairs Department, was resolved at a regular meeting to be submitted to the 15th Executive Committee for discussion and resolution. It was approved to follow the precedent of Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong, and set up a Nanshi office in the remaining buildings of the Nanshi National Goods Market for members to connect. Executive Committee member Ke Ganchen was appointed as the director of the Nanshi office.</p>

<p>The Citizen Newspaper, published by the Citizen Newspaper Office in Taipingfang, Hankou Road, has been published for two years. Last year, the authorities misunderstood, and the mailing of the newspaper was suspended. However, the newspaper has always upheld justice and promoted Buddhism, and is very popular with readers. After many party and national veterans explained to the central government on its behalf, the authorities allowed the newspaper to be mailed as usual. Therefore, the newspaper's sales have increased sharply recently. It is also heard that the newspaper has been greatly refreshed this year, and nine types of weekly supplements have been added. Recently, the Panchen Lama will go to Hangzhou to build the Kalachakra Mandala Dharma Assembly. The newspaper has specially dispatched a commissioner to be stationed at the Dharma Assembly. In the future, all important news about the Dharma Assembly, as well as the purification, opening instructions, rituals and all kinds of Dharma affairs during the Dharma Assembly, will be systematically recorded by the newspaper in order to fulfill the sincerity of promoting the Dharma.</p>

<p>Xujiahui Installs Water Pipes</p>
<h3 id="e157">French Municipal Council Interferes Beyond Its Borders <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Demolishing Water Pipes and Expelling Guards</p>
<p>Merchants and Residents of the Whole Town Rise Up in Opposition</p>
<p>Since last winter, the Shanghai Municipal Government approved the installation of tap water pipes in Xujiahui Town by the Public Utilities Bureau to meet the needs of residents. However, the French authorities claimed that the road section from the Yang Baokang Rice Store in front of the intersection of Xuzhen Road, north along Haige Road to the intersection of Tongren Street, about 20 yards long under the sidewalk, was built beyond the border. Therefore, they did not allow water pipes to be laid underground there, causing a part of the project to be invisibly stalled. To this day, it has not been resolved. Unexpectedly, at around 9 am the day before yesterday (19th), during the busiest time of business, French patrolmen suddenly dispatched 10 armed Chinese and Vietnamese policemen, with great momentum, and ordered the vendors there to move away and not to set up stalls. They also expelled the second post police of the sixth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who had been stationed there for years to maintain traffic in the center of the road, and did not allow them to stand there. The police, unable to communicate in their language and fearing misunderstandings, reported to the police station. After receiving the report, the station chief Bi Zhenhua believed that it was related to national sovereignty and it was difficult to remain silent. In addition to ordering the police to temporarily serve at the street intersection (i.e., the intersection of Xuzhen Road), he reported the information to Director Wen, who forwarded it to the Municipal Government to make serious representations to the French Consul. At about 2 pm, the French Municipal Council dispatched a Westerner leading dozens of workers to forcibly demolish the section of water pipes that had already been laid and dug them out from underground and piled them on the wasteland west of the Tongren Street Bridge. People were panicked and uneasy for a time, causing major diplomatic conflicts. Merchants and residents of the entire town believe that the land there belongs to the Chinese territory. Now the French Municipal Council has unreasonably driven away our vendors, seized our police power, and is taking every inch. If we do not fight for it on the basis of reason, what unimaginable consequences will there be in the future? It is said that an emergency meeting will be held at a certain number in the town this afternoon to discuss countermeasures, and they are willing to be the government's support.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Jackson Ship</p>
<h3 id="e158">Arrest of Japanese Offender Yamauchi <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that the Shanghai Japanese Consulate Police Station received a telegram from the Waseda Police Station in Tokyo on the 19th, stating that a passenger, Kyohei Yamauchi, had committed the crime of abduction and embezzlement and escaped to Shanghai on the President Jackson ship. They hoped to arrest him immediately. However, since the ship was owned by the United States, the Japanese police station consulted with the US Consul General, and with the Consul General's consent, at 6:30 this morning (21st), two officers, Ito and Koyuen, led the officers of the Municipal Council to board the ship and arrest the offender. (The offender had already used the alias Kiyoshi Nakata on the ship.) According to the offender's confession, he graduated from the Faculty of Law at Tokyo Hosei University and is currently serving as the secretary of the First Finance Bank of the Tokyo Credit Association. On March 14th, after embezzling over 2,000 yuan from Mr. Ozawa, he secretly escaped to Shanghai. The reasons for his crime are quite complicated, the most important being a woman problem. At the time of the arrest, he still had over 1,700 yuan in cash with him.</p>
<p>Poor Hong Zhengqing</p>
<h3 id="e159">Suicide After Unemployment <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Work for Over a Year, Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Wife's Search Hastens His Death</p>
<p>Hong Zhengqing, a native of Ningbo, was 41 years old. He used to work in a money exchange. His family consisted of his wife, Yu, 43 years old, and six children. Lacking any permanent assets, the family relied entirely on Hong's earnings. He lost his job nearly a year ago and frequently traveled between Shanghai and Ningbo, seeking recommendations from relatives and friends for work, but without success. Recently lodging in a hotel, he felt overwhelmed by the burden of supporting his family, leading to thoughts of ending his life. He attempted suicide multiple times but was stopped by relatives and friends. They sent a letter to his wife, Yu, requesting she come to Shanghai to supervise him or accompany him home. His wife arrived in Shanghai after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>She stayed for only three days, lodging at the home of a relative surnamed Yuan at 98 Kulun Road, Zhabei, and asked people to find Hong. However, upon learning his wife had come to Shanghai to find him, Hong became even more determined to end his life. On the 19th, at 11 PM, he went to the Youfa Small Hotel at 154 West Xinjiao Street in the French Concession, renting room number four. That night, he ingested poison and committed suicide. The next day at noon, a hotel worker, Zhang Jinsheng, was cleaning the room and asked him to get up, but received no response. He pried open the door and found that Hong had taken poison and was unable to speak. A suicide note was on the table in front of the bed, addressed to his wife and children, and his brother-in-law, Yu Lanqing, bidding farewell and asking them to take care of his wife and children. The hotel immediately reported to the police, and he was taken by car to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:30 PM. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall to examine the body. The family was notified. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the Second Special District Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived to examine the body, confirming that the deceased had died by ingesting poison. His wife was allowed to claim the body for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>A University Student Gives Up His Seat to a Chinese Woman</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Taken by a Western Woman</p>
<p>| A Minor Dispute Arises, the Western Woman Accuses Him of Injury |</p>
<p>Zhu Erkang, a student from Shanghai's St. John's University and a native of Ningbo, was on his way home from school on the morning of the 15th of this month at 10:15 AM. He boarded a Route 1 bus and it was quite crowded. Suddenly, Huang Xucai, a female teacher at a Municipal Council primary school, boarded the bus with her nanny, Zeng Pengshi, carrying a child. Zhu immediately stood up and offered his seat to Zeng Pengshi. However, a Western woman, Kraeler Cher, who was sitting next to them, suddenly took the seat and gave it to another Western woman, Peidi Peggy. Zhu negotiated with her, leading to a dispute. A ticket inspector named Leve Ming caught wind of this and took both parties to the Jing'an Temple police station. After investigation by the detectives, both parties were released. Afterwards, Kraeler suddenly went to the German doctor, Bai Li, for examination, claiming that her head and fingers had been injured by Zhu's beating. Dr. Bai issued a medical certificate. Kraeler then reported the incident to the police station, who then asked the First Special Court to issue a summons. Zhu was summoned to court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed charges according to Article 293 of the Criminal Law. Kraeler Cher and Peidi Peggy Leve testified that Zhu Erkang indeed punched Kraeler's head. However, Zhu denied it, saying, "I asked them to stand up, and the plaintiff immediately uttered abusive words and hit me repeatedly. I never hit the plaintiff at all." Subsequently, Huang Xucai and Zeng Pengshi came forward to testify, saying that they only saw the plaintiff beating the defendant and did not see the defendant beating the plaintiff. Judge Wu Xiangzu then ordered the plaintiff to be examined by a forensic doctor. The results showed that Kraeler only had a minor scratch on her middle finger, and no other injuries. Judge Wu then ruled that Zhu Erkang was not guilty. The police requested that he be released on bail during the appeal period. The court then instructed Zhu to provide a surety who could be summoned at any time during the appeal period.</p>

<p>| A Quack Doctor Causes Immeasurable Harm |</p>
<p>In the Pingyin Bridge area of Xietu Road, Shanghai, a woman from Anhui, Liao Zhang, 35 years old, suffered from severe tooth pain, causing her to be unable to eat or sleep. She hired a quack doctor named Sun Zhen to treat her. Sun said the tooth needed to be extracted. He forcibly pulled out a molar with pliers. Unexpectedly, he injured a blood vessel, and the bleeding would not stop. The woman immediately fainted and died shortly after. Her family mourned greatly and took Sun to the Second District Police Station. In addition to submitting a report, Zhang Liqing, the head of the 27th Bao and the local security official, was ordered yesterday to report the case to the local court for examination.</p>

<p>Rooms Should Be Equipped with Safety Devices</p>
<p>Fuel Residue Should Be Removed Outdoors</p>
<p>The Director-General of the French Municipal Council in Shanghai, Chuan Leisi, issued a notification yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of notification, gas lights, even if they do not contain carbon dioxide, already have toxic properties. If they contain carbon dioxide, the toxicity is even greater. Therefore, any gas leak can cause a major disaster. This bureau hereby warns all gas users to take preventative measures to avoid chronic poisoning or suffocation, and to prevent the gas from mixing with oxygen in the air and causing an explosion. Those who use gas for heating must know that gas can produce carbonic acid and carbon dioxide, which is the same as using charcoal. Therefore, the residue from this fuel must be removed outdoors at all times, otherwise it will cause harm, even if it does not lead to death. As for rooms with gas equipment installed, each unit should be equipped with a vent. The sealed hot water tank of a gas water heater should be equipped with safety devices. The surface of the tank that comes into contact with the flame should be cleaned at least once every two years. This notification is hereby issued."</p>

<p>Construction Cost Estimated at 200,000 Yuan, Jointly Operated by Government and Business</p>
<p>A reporter from the Huadong News Agency learned that the municipal government has decided to establish a tap water company in Pudong to engage in excavation and construction. The company's capital is set at 200,000 yuan, with government shares accounting for 40%, or 80,000 yuan, and business shares accounting for 60%, or 120,000 yuan.

<p>The Main Culprit is the Chef of the Guangfeng Company</p>
<p>Harboring Resentment After Being Fired, He Organized a Gang to Commit the Robbery</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Jiangbei Guangfeng North-South Ham Co., Ltd., located at 10 Hengxing West Lane, Sixteenth Bund, Nanshi, and its joint account Shenzhuang of the Rugao Gongyu Money Exchange, was invaded by five robbers at around 7:00 PM on the 4th of last month, who stole banknotes and silver dollars totaling 20,600 yuan. After investigation, the responsible First District Headquarters dispatched personnel to arrest Jin Qilang, a native of Chongming. Jin confessed that he had heard Zhou Xiaotao, the chef of the Guangfeng Company, say that Zhou had masterminded the robbery and had discussed it several times with Bao Azhang, who specializes in making egg noodles, and Xiaomazi Zhou Huansheng. Later, Zhou led four accomplices to commit the robbery. Personnel were then dispatched to 198 Danfeng Road to arrest Bao Azhang. According to Bao's confession, the Guangfeng Company had planned to fire Zhou last year because his cooking was poor, which angered Zhou.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Origin of the Robbery <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The company's joint account, Gongyu Money Exchange, lacked accomplices, so he discussed it several times with Bao, Xiaomazi Zhou Huansheng, and Huosun Lin Gen at Bao's home. Later, Xiaomazi gathered accomplices to commit the robbery. Afterwards, Xiaomazi gave Bao 100 yuan of the stolen money. The matter was then discovered by a blind rogue, Zhang Mingfu (blind in one eye), who extorted 6 yuan of the stolen money. Zhang Mingfu was then detained and interrogated, and Zhang confessed that he had learned that Azhang and others had formed a gang to commit the robbery, so he went to Bao to extort 6 yuan. The truth of the case has now been clarified. In addition to sending the three captured criminals to the bureau for interrogation on the 15th of this month, orders have been issued to subordinates to strictly pursue and arrest the fugitive Zhou Xiaotao and other main criminals to be brought to justice. A few days ago, Yuan Haishan, a detective in the district, suddenly received</p>
<h3 id="e166">Confidential Tip from an Informant <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>That the main culprit in this case, Xiaomazi Zhou Huansheng, was hiding in Suzhou. District Chief Guan Gongjia immediately dispatched squad leader Dong Mingde and others to Suzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to cooperate with the Wu County Public Security Bureau. They arrested Xiaomazi Zhou Huansheng at the Tianxing Restaurant on Huanglifang Bridge in the county town and brought him back to Shanghai. Under strict interrogation by District Chief Guan, Zhou confessed that he was 30 years old and a native of Jiangyin. Zhou Xiaotao had indeed masterminded the robbery, but at the time, Zhou had secretly discussed it several times with Bao Azhang, Lin Gen Huosun, and others. Later, Huosun was responsible for providing information, and Zhou invited his friend Yang Mingchang and several accomplices to commit the robbery. Afterwards, they went to the Zhongnan Restaurant to</p>

<p>At that time, Zhou received 2,900 yuan of the stolen money. However, Yang told Zhou that it was inconvenient to carry so much money on his person, so he asked Zhou to deposit 2,700 yuan of the stolen money with Yang for safekeeping, to be taken out at any time. At that time, Zhou thought it was a good idea, so he deposited 2,700 yuan with Yang, and Yang gave him another 700 yuan, instructing him to entrust it to Huosun Lin Gen, and to distribute 500 yuan to Zhou Xiaotao and 200 yuan to Bao Azhang. Zhou then hid the remaining 200 yuan and fled to Suzhou, gambling every day in a gambling den, so the money he carried with him was soon exhausted. He was planning to ask Yang to return the 2,700 yuan he had deposited with him, but Yang had already fled without a trace. After searching everywhere without success, Zhou realized he had been deceived and was feeling economically distressed and</p>

<p>When, coincidentally, detectives detected his trail and came to Suzhou, leading to his arrest. He now only knew that Lin Gen Huosun had fled to Wuxi, and he really did not know the whereabouts of the others. The personnel then went to the address provided and arrested Qi Lin Gen (Lin Gen Huosun) in the North Gate Main Street area of Wuxi. They brought him to the Wu County Public Security Bureau and then to Shanghai for interrogation. Qi confessed that he had provided information for Zhou and others and distributed the stolen money, all truthfully.</p>
<p>He also confessed that Zhou and others had given him only 60 yuan of the stolen money. Given the importance of the matter, an official document was prepared yesterday to send Zhou and Qi to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for punishment. Orders were also issued to subordinates to arrest the other fugitives to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>The Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus are in contact with the Shanghai business community and local gentry, and have organized a preparatory committee for the Pudong Tap Water Company. Two official members and five business members have been appointed. The official members are Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau. The business members are Lin Kanghou from the Bankers' Association, Zhang Xiaoliang from the Jiuji Construction Company, and local gentry and industrialists Yao Mulian, Kuai Yanfang, and Pan Zhiwen. Within three years of establishment, the business shares will be guaranteed a 4% interest rate, to be paid by the municipal government upon maturity. A committee meeting will be held soon to discuss the implementation of the plan. It is expected that this tap water company will be established in the shortest possible time, and the completion of the Pudong tap water project is expected to be realized in two years.</p>

<p>The report of Mr. Mei Baiqi, the leader of the Municipal Council Music Band, for the past year states: "Six special concerts were held this year, with audiences ranging from 1,100 to 1,837 people. Regular Sunday concerts were held at the Carlton Theatre seventeen times before May, with an average audience of 385 people. After October, nine concerts were held at the Grand Theatre, with an average audience of 666 people. Twenty-nine open-air concerts were held in the summer at the Zhaofeng Public Garden. The brass band performed in various parks thirty times.</p>
<p>The structure of the Grand Theatre seems to be very suitable for sound films, but not very suitable for the performance of the music band. Moreover, there are no suitable seats on the stage, so the arrangement of the performers is difficult to be appropriate, and the lighting is also not perfect. As for the performance time, some people strongly advocate changing it to 5:15 PM on Sunday afternoons, instead of the current 9:15 PM, to facilitate the audience.</p>
<p>Chinese people are paying more and more attention to the performances of this band. This year, a Chinese musician participated in one of the special concerts, and the results were very satisfactory. Although the general audience is not large, the number of Chinese people among them is increasing, especially in the summer.</p>
<p>From January to May last year, the band was broadcasted by radio, but the results were not very satisfactory. This year, a new broadcasting method has been arranged so that the public can enjoy the band's performances without paying for tickets."</p>

Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai two years ago, all industries have been in decline, causing Gu to be heavily indebted and difficult to maintain. He had no choice but to find a way to make up for it. Therefore, in July of last year, through his cousin Xie Shunkang and Nai Zhaogenlin, he painfully sold his 13-year-old daughter, Gu Xiaomao, to Wang Shutian and Wang Yi, a couple from Suzhou, as an adopted daughter. A contract was drawn up, and he received 250 yuan for her, which he used to repay old debts. Wang makes a living as a storyteller and is employed by Ying Guohua and others</p>

Wang and his wife searched everywhere without success and went to her parents to negotiate. Gu Shunfu and his wife went out to look for her but could not find her. They then ran into her on Moore Road and grabbed Xiaomao, intending to send her back to Wang's house. Xiaomao was unwilling,</p>

<p>He requested that the defendants be interrogated. The defendants hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Gu Xiaomao testified that she was 13 years old, and Gu Shunfu and Gu Zhu were her biological parents. In July of last year, she came to Shanghai from her hometown of Wuxi and was sold to Wang by her parents. Because she was repeatedly abused, she did not want to live with Wang anymore. A few days ago, she ate a piece of candy that Wang Yi had left on the table, which caused Wang Shutian to punch and kick her, injuring her arm. Yesterday morning, she was afraid</p>

<p>So she ran away to a relative's place at the Moore Road Jesus Church. Later, her parents found her and wanted to send her back, but she refused, leading to a dispute. Gu also claimed that she had heard Wang and others say that they wanted to send her to a brothel when she grew up, so she did not want to go back with Wang now. Upon questioning, Gu Shunfu and Gu Zhu confessed that Xiaomao was indeed their biological daughter, 13 years old, born on the tenth day of the second month. They had been living in Shanghai and making a living as peddlers. After the Shanghai War affected them,</p>

<p>So on the third day of July last year, they sold Xiaomao to Wang Yi as an adopted daughter, receiving 250 yuan, which they used to repay old debts and as capital for peddling. Judge Liu Yugui examined the contract and found that there were two contracts, one for adoption and the other stating that Gu Xiaomao would become a prostitute or marry someone. When Gu Shunfu was asked what this meant, Gu replied that he was illiterate and the contract was written by</p>

<p>Wang Shutian said that because he had no children and his wife liked children, he bought Gu Shunfu's daughter, whom he had known in Suzhou, out of pity because he saw that he was extremely poor, and treated her as an adopted daughter. He had never abused her, but he had beaten her slightly for stealing things. Wang Yi's testimony was similar. Judge Liu checked whether Gu Xiaomao had any injuries. After the court clerk accompanied Gu to the forensic doctor for examination, there were no major injuries. The judge then ordered the lawyers for both parties to argue and ruled that the debate in the case was over. Wang Shutian and his wife were each released on 500 yuan bail. Gu Shunfu and his wife were remanded in custody. Xiao Mao will remain at the Jiliang Institute for the time being.</p>

Yan's family members handed him over to the Public Security Bureau, and the Second Special Court brought him back and prosecuted him. After several trials, at the end of last year, Li Guocheng was sentenced to death for jointly planning the murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights.

A few days ago, she made the excuse of going out to find business and wanted to move her clothes and belongings away, but Yu discovered her plan and tried to stop her, resulting in a constant quarrel. The day before yesterday, Yu, after thinking about it, felt extremely resentful and suddenly had the thought of ending his life. Before dawn, he went out alone and hanged himself on an electric pole in the lane. At about 6 a.m., he was spotted by his neighbor Mao Zhaotong, who tried to untie him. Unfortunately, he had already breathed his last. He immediately reported it to the Jiaxing Road Public Security Bureau, and detective Liu Shuxun was ordered to investigate. He then took him by car to the Tongren Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The body was carried to the Feilun Road Autopsy Center. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei, accompanied by the two forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to come to the center to examine the body. According to the testimony of the deceased's son, Yu Xiaobing, 14 years old, "The deceased is my father. Recently, my mother wanted to run away, so he committed suicide. They had fought each other." According to Yu Chen, a native of Yancheng, "My former husband owed the deceased 60 yuan, and could not repay it, so he gave me to him as his wife. Five days ago, I wanted to make a living, so I moved my clothes to Little Sisters' place on Dalianwan Road, and he argued with me." According to the report of Chinese detective Liu Shuxun, "After the investigation, Guo ruled that the deceased Yu Xuqing had indeed committed suicide by hanging himself before death." The body was handed over to his son Yu Xiaobing, who signed an agreement to take it back for burial.</p>

<p>Sichuan Store to Establish a Main Store on Nanjing Road The Sichuan Store in the Paoqiu Stadium of this city has long been famous at home and abroad for selling Sichuan silver ear fungus, all Sichuan products, and ginseng and bird's nest tonics at genuine prices. Therefore, even in this time of economic depression in all industries, the store's business has been growing daily. Recently, the address of the Paoqiu Stadium store is located in a corner, which is not enough for use. It is also not very convenient for customers to come and go. Therefore, it has also established a main store at No. 316 Nanjing Road (East End of Pintang Lane), the most bustling central area of this city. It is currently being renovated day and night. The rules are very grand and will be completed soon and will be opened soon. From now on, it will be more convenient for people from all walks of life to go to the store to buy silver ear fungus.</p>
<p>New Store for Sichuan Silver Ear Fungus Silver ear fungus from Tongjiang, Taiping, and Nanjiang counties in northern Sichuan is the best, and its effects are greater. Local ear merchants have their own mountain farms. The industry in this city has been wholesaling from them for over 30 years. The Xie Xinggong Silver Ear Fungus Shop on Yanghang Street in the French Concession is the organization for these merchants. Recently, silver ear fungus from Guizhou and Hubei has also been transported to Shanghai for sale. In order to maintain the Sichuan silver ear fungus, the merchants have specially contacted the ginseng merchants and established a retail department in the Paoqiu Stadium on Nanjing Road, named the North Sichuan Silver Ear Fungus Shop, specializing in the sale of silver ear fungus, ginseng, bird's nest, deer antler, musk, cinnamon, and various tonics, totaling over 100 kinds, with prices at 10% off wholesale prices. There are ginseng and bird's nest products for one yuan and high-quality silver ear fungus products for two yuan (limited to one can per person), exquisitely decorated, with a guarantee of refund and replacement. It is reported that the shop has opened and its business is very prosperous.</p>
<p>Kangyutang Chinese Medicine Store to Open Tomorrow The Kangyutang Pharmacy on Shengmuyuan Road in this city will open on the 23rd. It took more than a year to build a tall Western-style building, and it has finally been completed. The corners and angles are quite artistic, and the interior is even more magnificent, with extremely exquisite decoration and perfect equipment. It is the largest pharmacy in Shanghai. The store owner Cen Qisheng and manager Ma Wenbin have also set up a diagnosis and medicine dispensing department, recruiting famous doctors from Shanghai to benefit patients. This is truly commendable.</p>

<p>The Grand Opening of the Huiqun Hospital The Huiqun Hospital at Nos. 359 to 2361 Aiduya Road, Zilaishui Street Intersection, was founded solely by Liang Huiying, a well-known female doctor in Shanghai. After more than a month of renovation, it was officially opened the day before yesterday. On that day, more than a hundred people, including well-known figures from the business community and guests from all walks of life, attended, making it a grand occasion. At that time, Ms. Liang personally greeted the guests and gave a detailed description of the internal organization, such as the obstetrics, gynecology, pediatrics, ENT, dental, and venereal disease departments, as well as various difficult and complicated diseases. In addition, there are inpatient rooms for patients to stay in for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Liang is a graduate of the Guangzhou Obstetrics Medical College, so she is particularly specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, such as breech births and abnormal presentations, which she handles quickly and skillfully with rich experience. Now, in addition to transferring all the original doctors from the Huiling Hospital, she still feels that the number of doctors is insufficient. She has now specially hired many famous male and female doctors, including Tang Huiying, to be responsible for the treatment of patients who come to the hospital. It is thought that the patients in Shanghai will have another blessing.</p>

<h3 id="e204">How to Study the Northeast Problem) 2 ( <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Mr. Fang, claiming to be a refugee from the Northeast, proposed how to study the Northeast problem and requested the editorial department to pay attention. Now, we will first make a blunt clarification of Mr. Fang's views, and tomorrow we will discuss the methods for studying this problem. - The Editor</p>
<p>We are very grateful to Mr. Fang for raising such a practical issue, which allows us to have the opportunity to re-awaken readers' attention and discussion of the Northeast problem. We have long said that theory and practice cannot be separated. Whether studying social sciences or literature, if you only read dead books and pay no attention to practical problems, then even if you read ten thousand volumes of books, you can only be a bookworm. Therefore, whenever we deal with general problems, we always try to bring up many concrete problems as examples. Of course, this is still not enough, and we should also discuss more specific practical problems as the center. Regarding this point, in addition to fully accepting Mr. Fang's opinions, we also hope that readers will raise more such practical problems for discussion in the future. Regarding Mr. Fang's letter, we can divide it into two parts to answer: one part is based on the current situation in the Northeast as described by Mr. Fang, with a brief explanation; the other part is how to study the Northeast problem.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the first part first. The current situation in the Northeast as described by Mr. Fang is, of course, largely true. Imperialists treat all colonies in this way: they use both high-pressure policies and appeasement policies, which is the most vicious policy. However, from Mr. Fang's letter, we see that Mr. Fang seems to only focus on one aspect of the problem: seeing the temporary prosperity of Manchuria without seeing the hidden crisis; seeing the apparent depression of the people's spirit without seeing the reasons for the depression and the power and anti-imperialist struggle of the hundreds of millions of people lurking within. Undoubtedly, the September 18th and January 28th incidents created absolutely different attitudes among different social groups in China. Some people are indeed "depressed," no! Or more accurately, they are "indifferent," or to put it more harshly, they are very optimistic. They only know how to show off beautiful words and phrases to deceive everyone. Mr. Fang cannot help but feel the vastness of the "songs and dances of peace" at sea, but this does not include the general public. These high-class Chinese have always been like this. Has "golf" and "foxtrot" ever stopped for a single night on the day of January 28th? These places, of course, are not accessible to hardworking people. People who can talk don't do it themselves, and they are probably not happy when others do it. Regarding the anti-Japanese aspect, we have indeed seen many people who want to "resist," using blood to exchange for blood, but at the same time, there are also people who are preventing others from doing it, and who do not hesitate to use "blood" to fight for the victory of this national policy. Naturally, the temporary victory will belong to this group.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the surface, although the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, the phenomenon shows "songs and dances of peace," the masses are silent, creating an illusion for Mr. Fang.</p>
<p>What about the other group? They cannot afford to play "golf" and cannot afford to "foxtrot." They are suffering in life and have been forced to the brink of death. They have no other way to go except to fight to the death with imperialism. These people are bound to disturb the jazz music in the dance halls. Although sometimes they are forced to be silent, the "bandits" all over the country are being suppressed every day, but the disturbances are still there, and the world is not peaceful. This shows that under the cold crust, there is still a raging fire, and the earth has not really died!</p>
<p>Speaking of the volunteer army's resistance against Japan, we certainly admire the heroic acts of the past, but speaking of the comparison of forces and the purity of quality, the current surviving civilian armed forces are indeed weaker in number than before, but in fact, they are more optimistic than before. Because there were too many high-class Chinese in the previous front. Now that generals have become famous for resisting Japan, they should naturally retire to famous mountains and receive offerings of fragrant flowers. Of course, only the truly fearless "muddle-headed fools" bury their heads in doing foolish things. In this way, although the large "army" has been changed to small guerrilla warfare, it is indeed a bit of a trouble for the Japanese army because these lowly people do not love money and bribes. Therefore, in this aspect, a contradiction is also formed. On the surface, the volunteer army is indeed weakened, but in its essence, the volunteer army is growing and reorganizing. Unfortunately, Mr. Fang only sees the appearance.</p>
<p>In short, the people and things that Mr. Fang saw are all wearing illusions, and they have all been deceived by the smoke screen of the high-class Chinese. Although excited and indignant, it is inevitably filled with the mood of defeatism and the mood of pessimism, as if there is only despair for the Northeast, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. Of course, we cannot deny the influence of the Japanese imperialist appeasement policy on the people of the Northeast, nor can we ignore the role of slave education on the people of the Northeast; at the same time, we can no longer tolerate everyone being willing to be depressed. But we should also recognize reality and have a scientific and correct analysis of the reality of the Northeast, and liberate the above illusions.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a matter of observation methods, which is a problem that people who are concerned about the national crisis must first grasp. Below, we will put forward specific methods for studying the Northeast problem; at the same time, we will liquidate some harmful thoughts of Mr. Fang and many people with the same views as Mr. Fang, in order to contribute to those who are concerned about the Northeast problem and serve as their reference.

<h3 id="e206">Tung Wah Loses to Navy Again <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Navy Opens the Score</p>
<p>Tung Wah Wins 4 to 1</p>
<p>The second match of the Tung Wah vs. British Navy's Western League football Group A was held yesterday afternoon at Shen Garden. Although Tung Wah's lineup changed a lot, they still controlled the Navy with plenty to spare. After the Navy opened the scoring, Tung Wah eventually won again with a score of 4 to 1.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Lineup Changes <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Due to the absence of Li Ning, Tu Kaiyuan, Guan Xun'an, and others, Tung Wah's lineup changed greatly. The two Fengs were stationed in front of the goal, Li Yichen presided over the center, Yang Renwei was used as the left midfielder, Jia Youliang was the right midfielder. The defense was average, and the forwards were still okay. Except for Chen Yutian, who was a little weak, the new recruits Li Rong'an and Zhou Guangzhong were both brave and good at fighting. Dai Wan did not lose his prestige. With such a lineup, it is no wonder that they only won by 4 to 1. The situation was still relatively even, and the interest was very bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e208">First Loss of a Goal <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Navy was late by a quarter of an hour due to not knowing the way, and the game did not start until 3:20. Tung Wah kicked off against the wind, and the ball was unfavorable. Dai Lin passed the ball to Chen Yutian, who missed the shot. The Navy came back strong, but unfortunately, they did not succeed. Both sides were evenly matched and gained nothing. The performance of both sides had a very awkward momentum. At 42 minutes, the Navy suddenly gained momentum, and Wu Tefu succeeded in one fell swoop. In the first half, the Navy actually won 1 to 0.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Joint Artillery Fire <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Tung Wah cheered up, and the ball's momentum was greatly enhanced. The Navy was under attack everywhere and could not defend. Li Yichen had a free-kick opportunity and hit a goal. The ball was shot from 30 yards away with great force, like a surprise attack on the frontier of Vientiane. Gao Qiu skillfully passed the ball, and Dai the center forward launched a fierce attack, bouncing off the goalpost. Dai also got a corner kick opportunity and scored a goal, but unfortunately, it was not counted due to offside. At this time, Tung Wah's momentum was strong, like a joint artillery fire. The Navy was too busy to lift the frame and became a time of trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Three Consecutive Goals <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah was aggressive and persistent. Wan Xianghua shot remotely from the left corner and hit the target, 2 to 1. Tung Wah won the lead. Since then, the Navy has become the end of its rope, and the ball's momentum was completely under the control of Tung Wah. Dai the center forward finally scored two more goals in a row. As a result, Tung Wah won 4 to 1. The starting lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Lu Zhong'en, Feng Yunyou, Feng Nianying</p>
<p>Yang Renwei, Li Yichen, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Zhou Guangzhong, Dai Linjing, Li Rong'an, Chen Chutian</p>

<h3 id="e226">Mo Lei-de Arrives in Beijing to Discuss Cultural Cooperation <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Lecturing on [French Normal Education] at the Central Government</p>
<p>Mr. Mo Lei-de, Deputy Director of the International Labour Office of the League of Nations, entrusted by the League of Nations' Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, has come to China to investigate labour and cultural conditions and to help develop Chinese education. Mr. Mo arrived in Beijing last week and has been very busy visiting the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming, the Minister of Industry, Chen Gongbo, and the Minister of Education, Wang Shijie. On the afternoon of the 20th, the Ministry of Education specially invited Mr. Mo to the Ministry for a tea party to discuss cultural cooperation. It is said that the main method is to pay attention to the future research direction of Chinese students studying abroad. Because our country is currently experiencing a shortage of talent, various technical personnel are seeking to hire foreign personnel, and at the same time, it is felt that students studying abroad have no way out after returning to the country, resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand. This time, Mr. Mo was ordered to come to China to negotiate with our country's authorities on the establishment of a guidance mechanism between the League of Nations and China to direct the direction of students studying abroad, with the aim of cultivating the talents needed by China. This plan is under discussion and a concrete decision will be made in the coming days. Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, considering Mr. Mo an educational expert, specially invited Mr. Mo to the university the other day to lecture on [French Normal Education]. The following is a transcript of his speech, the gist of which is that before discussing the French normal education system, two special principles of French politics and education should be explained: (1) France is one of the ancient civilizations and had early establishment of universities, the structure and spirit of which still exists in current education. (2) Although France is a democratic country, its history is quite short, and it gradually formed since 1870. From the second principle, French normal education, because it must adapt to the needs of a democratic country, promulgated a law in 1885 stipulating (1) that education is a right that everyone should have; (2) that education is transcendent and not bound by religion; (3) compulsory education for children; (4) free admission to national education. Before the promulgation of this law, only 500,000 children were enrolled in schools nationwide, and after the promulgation of this law, 3 million children were enrolled in schools at the same time. Therefore, there was a sudden shortage of primary school teachers. In order to train a large number of teachers, the country established one primary normal school for both men and women in each of the 89 prefectures, recruiting primary school graduates and giving them three years of rigorous training. This was because, based on the needs of a democratic country, each prefecture established primary normal schools simultaneously within one year. The curriculum of primary normal schools focuses on the inculcation of three points of common sense, the cultivation of hygiene and moral concepts, and the understanding of world social concepts. In addition, there are two higher normal schools, one for men and one for women, in Paris to train teachers for primary normal schools. The curriculum is also based on the above three principles, but the level is raised and the content is enriched. The state attaches importance to normal education, so for education, six to twelve years old is primary education, above is primary normal, and above again is higher normal. The foundation is large and the top is sharp, like a pyramid, very neat and uniform. This is one of the characteristics of French teacher education. As for the training of secondary school teachers, there is no special normal university. Graduates of ordinary universities can serve as secondary school teachers after passing the higher diploma examination. Therefore, the knowledge is very rich, but because they have not received considerable normal training, they feel a lack of teaching methods. This is the second characteristic of French normal education. Although France nominally does not have advanced normal schools for training secondary school teachers, there are two advanced normal schools in Paris. Admission to these two schools is very strict, focusing on the study of specialized knowledge and not on teaching methods. After graduation, some students serve as secondary school teachers, and some continue to stay at the school for three years of research, after which they can serve as professors in various universities. Many senior officials of the League of Nations and many political and diplomatic figures in France have also come from this school. Although this system is quite unique, its advantage is that it emphasizes rationality. Most secondary school teachers obtain excellent teaching methods from experience. This is the third characteristic of French normal education. After Mr. Mo finished speaking, Luo, the president of Central University, stood up and said that European education focuses on in-depth research of knowledge, and American education focuses on teaching methods, both of which are worthy of our reference for educational research.</p>
<p>Gan Province Recovered Area</p>
<h3 id="e227">Education Inspection Team Departs <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Shi also to go to various places for inspection</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The Gan Province Winter Vacation Teachers' Training Conference resolved to organize an Education Inspection Team for the recovered areas to understand the political, economic, and social conditions in the recovered areas and to assist in various reconstruction efforts in the recovered areas. All team members have been assigned to groups, with each group having five to seven members, with inspectors from the Department of Education as the backbone and instructors and volunteers as assistants. The planned inspection time is two to three weeks. In the future, a thousand-item report will be prepared and improvement plans will be formulated for the authorities' reference. Each team member will depart in groups in the coming days. The Provincial Department of Education has also requested the Provincial Government to forward a notice to the local garrisons along the way for protection. Director Cheng Shi will also personally depart to inspect various districts after the team members have departed. The county districts where each group will depart are: (District 1) Yugan and other eight counties, (District 2) Chongren and other nine counties, (District 3) Xingan and other eight counties, (District 4) Wanzai and other eight counties, (District 5) Xiushui and Tonggu two counties.</p>
<p>Peking Research Institute</p>
<h3 id="e228">Excavating Antiquities in Shaanxi <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Discovering Historical Sites such as Tang Steles and Song Porcelain</p>
<p>Excavations in Daming Palace and Xingqing Palace</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) After it was reported that the Shaanxi Archaeological Society, jointly formed by the Beiping Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Government, had excavated Tang Dynasty Daming Palace and Xingqing Palace illustrations, reporters learned that the director of the society, Xu Bingchang, had returned to Beiping. They visited him to learn more. The following is a record of Xu's conversation:</p>
<p>The current address of the society is in a side courtyard of the Shaanxi Civil Affairs Department, which is the former site of the Qing Dynasty Provincial Administration, and also the former site of the Tang Dynasty Secretariat. Tang steles have been unearthed there many times. In the winter of the 11th year of the Republic of China, the garrison also discovered the Yan Qinli stele written by Yan Lugong in that place, which is now stored in the small stele forest of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Last year, the Historical Research Association of the Beiping Research Institute sent me and others to Shaanxi for archaeological research. After arriving, we heard people say that when the Yan Qinli stele was discovered, the workers saw several stones under the stele and reported it to the foreman. However, at that time, the foreman could not pay the workers according to regulations because of the soldiers. The more work they did, the more money they lost, so he ordered the workers to hide them. My colleagues and I thought that most of the buried stones in the lower layer were still Tang steles, so we wanted to excavate them. Later, we found the foreman who contracted the work that day and asked him to point out the place where the original stele was unearthed and to ask about the buried stones in the lower layer. Unfortunately, he firmly denied it, so it was stopped. Later, we heard that he had told people in private that this denial was not true. We also heard that when the Yan Qin stele was first unearthed, before it was taken out of the pit, workers had rubbed it out several times, which was the earliest rubbing [the so-called "pit rubbing"]. The current value is quite expensive. My colleagues and I found the worker who rubbed the stele in the pit that day based on this clue and pointed out the pit, but because we were busy, we were unable to start work immediately. In February of this year, when I left Xi'an, because this kind of work did not take much time, I ordered He Shiji and Zhang Jiayi to excavate in their spare time. Now we have received a report that we have obtained a broken stele, which is an illustration of Daming Palace (small part) and Xingqing Palace (whole). Comparing it with the illustrations drawn in the old chronicles, there are many differences. The illustration has a scale, which is quite precise. The period of the stone carving remains to be verified. We also obtained a Tang Dynasty stele head, stele base, and patterned stele edges, as well as a Tang Dynasty Dugu clan tomb cover, Yihuo coins, Daguan coins, Zhenglong coins, and Song porcelain and Ming Chenghua porcelain fragments. We are still pursuing the main part of Daming Palace, and the work is still in progress. As for the report in the newspaper that both palaces are located outside the Jinhualuo in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an, that is quite a mistake. The palaces in Tang Chang'an City are divided into three places: the West Inner Daji Palace, in the northwest of the current city; the East Inner Daming Palace, in the northeast corner outside the current city; and the South Inner Xingqing Palace, inside and outside the current East Guandong Pass. The current Jinhualuo Village is its eastern boundary. The discovery of the illustrations of the two palaces should be helpful for textual research. According to the report, a broken stele of a part of the Third West Inner Daji Palace was also found next to Xiaoxiangzi Temple Street in the city. With this, the study of the Tang Palace should have new progress.</p>
<p>Baoshan County, this city</p>
<h3 id="e229">Guanlan Compulsory Education Quickly Formulating a Plan <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Aims to Universalize Education in the County within One Year</p>
<p>And Sets the First Preliminary Announcement Meeting for April 1st</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Education Bureau has spared no effort in experimenting with special education in recent years, such as the Shan-Hai Industrial School and the County-run Xiao Chang two academies. Since their establishment, the results have been very good. Now, in order to universalize education, the county is implementing Guanlan compulsory education, aiming to universalize education in the county within one year, and has set the first preliminary announcement meeting for April 1st. By this day next year, at least 90% of the Baoshan County residents will be able to recognize 1,000 characters, and 95% will be able to sign their own names. The following is an excerpt of its urgent plan:</p>
<h3 id="e230">Principles <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>(1) The people of Baoshan recognize it as their own obligation to strive for universalization, not elite education, not Miss education, not spendthrift education, but voluntary work-study groups. (2) Recognize that society is the school, and integrate the school with society. (3) Recognize that life is education, and integrate life with education. (4) Recognize that the combination of teaching and learning is the most effective way of life, that is, the most effective way of education. Learning and teaching both take doing as the center. (5) Recognize that mental work on labor is the real doing. (6) Recognize that those who know have the obligation to teach others, and those who do not know have the obligation to learn. (7) Recognize that those who know have the obligation to teach others, and those who do not know have the obligation to learn. (7) Recognize that China is a poor country, and Baoshan is a poor county. The poor county in a poor country should use poor methods to universalize the education needed by the poor, and not use wasteful methods to universalize the education not needed by the poor. (8) Recognize that China has reached a critical juncture of life and death, like the Yellow River is about to breach its banks. Even a child who carries a small stone is welcome. Everyone's strength must be called upon to save lives. Every person with knowledge and skills must be called upon to be a teacher or engineer. Every child who has a rudimentary knowledge of writing or is a head of a school must be called upon to be a little teacher or little engineer. (9) Acknowledge that the real education is to enable the public to obtain a kind of combined and promoted power.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Methods <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>(1) Establish a compulsory education college to lay out a compulsory education experiment network, engage in compulsory education research, and serve as the general hub for cultivating engineers in the county. (2) Promulgate an outline for adult work-study groups so that the people of the county can have a basis for automatic progress. Because cotton is the main production in the county, cotton work-study groups should be especially emphasized. The organizational outline should also be promulgated as soon as possible. The 200,000 mu of cotton should have 200 cotton work-study groups. Secondly, horticultural work-study groups are also important. (3) Promulgate an organizational outline for children's work-study groups so that children in various places can proceed automatically. (4) Promulgate procedures for existing schools to convert to work-study groups so that principals and teachers who are interested in converting can have a basis for automatic progress. (5) Issue a notice to all students in the county that they have the obligation to serve as little teachers, and principals and teachers of each school are responsible for guidance and assessment. (6) Issue a notice to schools in cotton-growing areas that each school must assist local cotton farmers in establishing a cotton work-study group and continue to be responsible for guidance. (7) Issue a notice to all literate people in the county to teach two people the characters they know. The obligation to teach people is as important as the obligation to pay taxes. (8) Raise the minimum amount of funding, 15,800 yuan for start-up costs and 35,500 yuan for recurring expenses. (9) Written education should contain compulsion: (A) On April 1, 1934, an order was issued to give a preliminary announcement to the people of the county, limiting them to finish reading the 1,000-character course designated by the county before March 31, 1935, and issuing the second preliminary announcement on June 1. (B) Starting from December 1, 1934, compulsory education will be implemented in the areas covered by the compulsory education experiment network. (C) At the end of December 1935, the universalization of education in the county will be announced. The temporary universalization standard is that 90% of the people above school age can recognize 1,000 characters, and 95% can sign their own names. (D) After the compulsory order is issued, if there are people who are illiterate in the family, shop, factory, or organization without reason, a fine of one yuan per person per month will be imposed according to the number of people, which will be paid by the head of the family, shop owner, factory manager, or organization host. (E) After the compulsory order is issued, literate adults or students who refuse to teach illiterate relatives and friends for whom they are responsible will be fined a dime for refusing to do good deeds and will be announced. (10) In addition to universalizing written education, it is also necessary to universalize production education, science education, self-defense education, transportation education, art education, health education, and relief education. The standards, steps, and deadlines for its universalization will be set separately.</p>

<p>Silver Case Shelved</p>
<h3 id="e241">Gold Market Rebounds Four Yuan Seventy <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Short Sellers Disappointed, Rush to Cover Positions</p>
<p>Breaks Through the Sixty Yuan Threshold</p>
<p>After the previous surge in the gold market was dampened, yesterday's silver price saw only a slight increase, bolstering confidence. Simultaneously, favorable news emerged, indicating a continued upward trend. The morning began with overseas silver markets in the UK and US driving the increase. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by only four to half a li, with exchange rates slightly higher. London spot gold fell by four pence, US cotton rebounded by ten points, and US wheat rose by three and seven-five points. Investor sentiment stabilized, and prices rose immediately upon opening. Disappointed short sellers rushed to cover their positions, quickly pushing the price past the sixty yuan threshold. According to the Associated Press, the US Congress has temporarily shelved the silver bill, pending the return of Mr. Rogers from China, with further discussions expected around April 7. Subsequent Reuters reports from Washington indicated that the US Senate has passed a resolution demanding that the Treasury Secretary disclose the list of silver speculators, as the Secretary had previously claimed that those supporting higher silver prices were acting out of self-interest. Simultaneously, news circulated that the government was trying to delay the silver issue, further pushing prices above sixty yuan. Banks became reluctant to buy, and the market fluctuated around sixty yuan, with limited gains and losses, maintaining a stable trend. Ultimately, firms, including those from the Guang faction, eagerly bought drafts, closing the morning session above sixty yuan, with the March contract also rising. The boiling red price was 973 yuan, with a premium of one yuan for the April-May spread. The morning market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 959.6 yuan, a rebound of 3.6 yuan from the previous closing price. Goods opened at 9.4 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices: one shilling four and twenty-five pence for British pounds, and thirty-four yuan five six two five for US dollars. Banks were immediately reluctant to buy, and the market was flat, retreating to 9.1 yuan. Then, Mitsui bought May US dollars at eight one two five and struggled to close April at six eight seven five. Zhifengyong, Yidayong, Yifengyong, Shengda, Yicheng, and Hengxingyuan all entered the market. Although Tianfeng was selling, the price gradually rose to 61.7 yuan. Huabi sold June US dollars at eight seven five, and April at six two five. Qian Changxiang sold strips, causing a setback. It was anticipated that HSBC would list British pounds at par and US dollars up one two five. HSBC came out with June US dollars at eight seven five, dropping again to 60.01 yuan. Yuan Maoyong set a price limit to buy and stabilize, while Mitsui bought July at 35 yuan. Zhifengyong continued to aggressively buy, pushing the price up to 1.7 yuan, with June US dollars at eight seven five, once closing in a mixed fashion. Zhengchang and Fuchang sold at higher prices, retreating to within 60 yuan. Subsequently, Huabi and Citibank bought July US dollars at zero six two five, with Hengxing and Zhifengyong showing buying interest. Daxingyong, on the other hand, sold and fluctuated around 60 yuan. Peers eagerly bought US dollars, tightening the domestic market. Yuan Maoyong, Qian Changxiang, Shengda, and Chunyongyong actively bought, gradually raising the price from 9.1 yuan to above 61 yuan. Bingxing and Yuanchun sold off, causing a slight retreat. After fluctuating, the morning session closed at 960.7 yuan, with goods being photographed at zero nine jiao. The market was very stable after the closing. Goods were bought in strips, while Yuanchun sold. The highest price during the morning was 961.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 959.1 yuan, a difference of 2.6 yuan. As a result, it rebounded 4.7 yuan compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The closing price was 34.375 yuan for US dollars listed by HSBC, a gain of one two five, equivalent to a gold price of over 1006 yuan. Based on the closing price, the premium was approximately 46 yuan, a decrease of over 8 yuan from the previous closing. The closing price for this month, calculated using the unchanged HSBC listing for British pounds, was 716 yuan and change. Based on the closing price, the premium was approximately 2 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan from the previous closing. The accounts recorded 715 yuan for this month, 962 yuan for April, and 961 yuan for May. The supplemental water for the morning was 715 yuan. The boiling red gold price was calculated at 973 yuan. Formal transactions in the market involved Yingfengheng, a peer, selling 350 taels to the Tianjin gang, at a premium of 14.5 yuan, and another 550 taels at a premium of 15 yuan, both being 99.3% pure. Initially, Qian Changxiang gave a premium of one yuan for 28 strips to Yuan Mao, with relatively quiet trading. Later, Yingfengheng gave a premium of one yuan for 112 strips to Wanxing, still at one yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Money Industry Stipulates Foreign Short-Term Loan Rate <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>|Minimum Not to Fall Below Five Points|</p>
<p>This year, due to the abundance of header linings in the money market and the urgent demand, the market rate for foreign short-term loans has been based on free lending. Recently, rates of two to three points have emerged. However, leaders in the industry, recognizing that daily free lending rates and rates of two to three points were detrimental to the market and observing that the current funds often exceeded demand, without any hope of a turnaround and increase, resolved at the Board of Directors meeting on the 16th of this month to stipulate that from March 21 (i.e., yesterday), the minimum rate for daily foreign short-term loans should be five points, with no subsequent market rate falling below five points. As a result, yesterday's rate was forcibly set at five points, with a strong restriction. The remaining funds of over 3 million were managed by the industry leaders, barely managing to pass. From now on, there will be no more free lending rates or rates of two, three, or four points for foreign short-term loans.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Small Coins Show Slight Fluctuations <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>

<h3 id="e246">Exploration of Reasons for Rise in Securities and Public Bonds <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>|Difficult to Fall, Easy to Rise... All Because Money is Useless|</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in the Chinese Securities Exchange was still very strong. Although there were slight increases, most of the daily and intraday prices saw increases. New high prices appeared frequently, and the trend was good, beyond expectations. The biggest reason was that the short sellers were selling at high prices, believing that the economy was depressed, the market was sluggish, the government's finances were difficult, and the situation on the surface seemed to be fine, but the danger was still not eliminated. With this view, they repeatedly sold short, but they did not know that the long positions were well-supported. Lending in the financial sector was difficult and tightened, and domestic funds were concentrated in Shanghai, either for arbitrage or interest speculation, which were more stable and active than other methods. The short sellers had no chance to help, and their embarrassment was fully exposed when the delivery date approached. The rise in the market price was also incredible. Although it was an abnormal development, it was also caused by human factors. The forecast for salt tax to see 65% off is now close to the mark, and according to the current situation, 65% off may not be the limit. Yesterday, the morning situation was slightly weaker, showing that one side was selling short and the other side was spreading, and the sellers were reluctant, so the first trade was slightly smaller by one or two jiao. The second trade showed inconsistent increases and decreases, because both long and short sides were spreading, and the market price fluctuated only by one or two jiao. The afternoon situation changed suddenly. Although the layoff of soldiers this month was reduced by two or three jiao, the force was limited, and the long-term still rose due to high demand. After that, it also rose by two or three jiao, and several new high prices were seen. The closing situation was not restrained, and the upward trend continued. Several new high prices were seen again. The salt tax had already broken through 54 yuan and was rising rapidly, which could not be explained by common sense. As a result, most of the market prices continued to rise by one or two jiao, and some of the current month contracts were still slightly smaller by one jiao. Although the market price fluctuated slightly, the trend was still firm. The total trading volume was 9,241,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 9,240,000 yuan in futures. The high, low, rise, and fall are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from Xinhua Foreign Firm on yesterday's New York stock market in the Wall Street Journal, the market was sluggish all day. Later, President Roosevelt invited leaders from capital and labor unions to discuss rescuing the automobile industry from labor unrest. The market then turned sharply higher, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The transmission machine could not handle the demand. The small exchange market also rebounded, and bonds also rose, especially those with speculative characteristics. However, the results were mostly slightly lower than the previous day's closing. U.S. Treasury bonds fell slightly, and foreign bonds saw mixed ups and downs. According to an agent's report, securities rose sharply due to President Roosevelt's intervention in the automobile industry's labor unrest, and the situation was better than before. Wheat: The market was sluggish and uneven, and a strike was imminent. The grain industry rules have been signed, and the market may loosen. Cotton: Investor sentiment was uncertain. Later, due to the President's intervention in labor disputes and the passage of the Datis silver bill, which contained inflationary implications, it rose slightly. The bill is now awaiting the President's comments on whether the bill needs to be passed in the Senate. According to public speculation, the President may think it is not necessary. If the labor problem has a solution based on the proposal in Washington on Thursday, it is predicted that the market will have a good reaction. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Yarn Market is Slightly Chaotic <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Selling Pressure Prevailed in the Morning with a Strong Downward Trend</p>
<p>Profit-Taking and Covering of Short Positions in the Afternoon Led to a Rebound</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation was still chaotic. The market rumors said that the factory opinions were still difficult to unite and that there were a large number of deliveries. As a result, the market suddenly became weak, and the selling trend was particularly strong. The March and April contracts broke through the 180 yuan mark. However, the amount absorbed by a certain factory still had no intention of giving up. In the afternoon, short positions were covered for profit-taking, and it rebounded by about one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Man-Made Marks Also Entered the 80 Yuan Mark <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the mark yarn market, there were many sellers in the market, and the downward trend was stronger. The near month fell by 1.8 to 2.3 yuan, and the far month fell by 4.5 jiao. In the afternoon, because the downward trend was too strong, it caused short positions to cover, and it rose by 0.5 to 1.2 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the day were 42,150 bales. It was found that 1,550 bales of Taichang were sold, 1,450 bales of Yuanda were sold, 850 bales of Yuanda were sold, 950 bales of Dachangcheng were sold, 1,050 bales of Changfeng were sold, 900 bales of Dafeng were sold, and 650 bales of Chunjie were sold. 1,400 bales of Renfeng were bought, 1,150 bales of Deki were bought, 1,100 bales of Zhenda were bought, 950 bales of Minghua were bought, and 850 bales of Dachangcheng were bought.

<p>The cotton market initially declined and then rebounded, but although the U.S. cotton Pound-Hay reduction plan has already been disappointing, many long positions have been slightly closed out. However, there is still a lack of new sellers, so the afternoon market saw a rebound. However, the near-month market is relatively tight, because the delivery chips are not sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="e259">Spot Flour Market Turns Weak Due to Long Liquidation <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed signs of initial stability followed by weakness in all months after the opening. Since the quoted prices for imported wheat fluctuated, with Chicago up by about 2 jiao and Canada down by 1 jiao, the market sentiment was initially stable. Subsequently, long positions were liquidated, and actual sales remained quiet. Therefore, the market sentiment for all months showed signs of loosening, and the sentiment for distant months was even less favorable. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices for all months fell step by step during the third session, down by varying amounts of 1 to 2 fen compared to the morning. Due to small factories selling off and continued long liquidation, the prices for the third session were supported again by long positions in the near-month contract, and large factories still did not resist selling, causing market sentiment to firm up again. However, the prices for all distant months ultimately remained weak and lifeless. As a result, the near-month contract was down by 2.5 li, the April/May contracts were down by 7.5 li, the June contract was down by 2.5 li, the July contract was down by 7.5 li, and the August contract was down by 1.25 fen.</p>

Since the quoted prices for imported wheat were up by about 2 jiao in Chicago and down by 1 jiao in Canada, the near-month contract was still held firm by buyers because delivery was approaching. It was also heard that short sellers were preparing to deliver, and the white wheat had already arrived with the professionals. However, since there were more long positions, the near-term contracts continued to be popular. Seeing that the flour market had softened and the weather would clear up soon after the rain, market sentiment softened for distant-term contracts. As a result, the near-month contract was up by 5 fen, the June contract was down by 1 fen, the July contract was down by 3 fen, and the August contract was down by 1 fen. The spot wheat market saw smooth transactions, and prices remained stable. Kainan Suzhou wheat was at 3 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, Yingzhou wheat was at 3 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, Bengbu wheat was at 3 yuan 5 jiao, and Yaowan wheat was at 3 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, totaling 6,500 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Late Rice Market Transactions are Relatively Active <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were slightly scarcer than before, with only about 30 vendors arriving (over 5,000 shi). However, late rice constituted a large portion, accounting for three-quarters, while thick japonica rice and other varieties only accounted for one-quarter. The sales of late rice were also brisk. Its situation has been quite lively since the beginning of the market, seemingly with an upward trend. Gangs from Northern ports such as Tianjin, Yantai, and Tanggu showed particularly strong interest, competing to purchase. Gangs from Southern ports such as Xiamen and Fuzhou also followed suit. Nearly 3,000 bags of Qingjiao, Song, Si, Feng, Jing, Xi, Lian, and other varieties were traded, and the market price rose slightly by 3 fen. For japonica rice from Chang, Su, Tong, Nangang, and other gangs, the market sentiment was initially firm due to the wind and rain the day before. However, the market turned soft after the weather cleared in the later part of the day. Fortunately, sellers managed to hold the prices firm. Duyang Jian and Yinbian Yuan showed no changes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from the river region numbered 22 to 23 vendors. Sales of various varieties in the market remained average. The market for white japonica early thin rice was weak and tired by a few points. High-quality rice from the wharves was scarce and stood firm. The prices of Yang Jian, Du Jian, Ke Jian, and Bai Yuan remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of spring, sales of Shandong yellow silk to Europe have almost completely stopped. The Shanghai warehouses have a total of 3,825 boxes of Shandong yellow coarse silk and yellow factory silk in stock. With the new spring cocoons about to enter the market, silk merchants lack funds to purchase cocoons. They are currently petitioning the Shandong provincial government to issue 500,000 yuan in silk public bonds to rescue the silk industry.</p>
<p>The production of Shanghai Shuang Gong silk is decreasing day by day, while the demand from India remains. The existing inventory is about to be sold out. In recent days, only 15 packages of Shuang Gong silk were exported to India on British ships. Overseas raw silk prices remain unstable. Japanese silk is being sold aggressively without letup, and there are no signs of changes in the silk telegrams from Europe and the United States. Shanghai merchants also have no silk telegrams to send out. Foreign firms are unmoved, and silk merchants are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market atmosphere is tired and quiet. Spring silkworms in Zhejiang are emerging, and Shanghai mills have abundant silk in stock. The future is increasingly pessimistic.</p>

<p>Due to weak sales to the United States last year, many Pingshui green tea manufacturers in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, switched to producing tea for export to French firms, which yielded a small profit. As a result, tea merchants are unusually enthusiastic about the tea industry in that region this year. The number of tea firms has increased from over 50 to 80 or 90, and the situation is quite active.</p>
<h3 id="e264">There is Over-Supply of Metal Rebar <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the inventory of rebar is exceptionally high, and there are even more arrivals. Therefore, the market is largely oversupplied. Standard prices have been quietly declining, estimated at 107 yuan per ton, down another yuan from before. It is heard that, aside from sporadic purchases from construction gangs, there have been very few large-scale transactions in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e279">The Ancients Are Not As Good As People Today <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Speaking of art, people today may not be inferior to the ancients, but generally people always [value the ancient and despise the present]. Remember Bai Letian's letter to Yuan Weizhi, which said, [Honoring the past and despising the present is a great human emotion]. No one has ever dared to belittle the ancients. Please read Tian Wen's Collection of Ancient Joy Hall, which says; [I observe that the ancient people's broken slips and residual pens, remaining ink and scraps of paper, all have excellent points. Writing is not only in Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, poetry is not only Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, and Meng Haoran, calligraphy is not only Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang, and Xue Ji, painting is not only in Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei, Zhang Sengyou, Wu Daozi, Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran. The same is true of utensils, not only are recent ancient times not as good as distant ancient times, but even ten years ago is better than ten years later by a factor of ten, a hundred, or a thousand. Why is the world declining?] This is an absolute pro-ancient faction.</p>
<p>Since the rise of the Restoration, the ancients have been overthrown, and everyone has uttered a [modern] word. At best, everything before this day and this time already belongs to the outdated. This kind of reaction can be considered the most rigid and strongest. However, after quietly observing society, I feel that this reaction is still unreliable. The same new reaction has occurred, and people seem to be [expressing their nostalgic thoughts and expressing their ancient sentiments]. This is an undeniable fact, and there are examples everywhere.</p>
<p>In my opinion, in terms of artistic technique, there is no need to be modest. The ancients were indeed inferior to people today. Just talking about riddles, like [Yellow silk young wife grandson, White,] hiding [Exquisite words], how clumsy! Later riddle-makers really fought wits and entered a state of divine transformation, which the ancients could never have imagined. No wonder Pan Zuyin thought of [My eastern neighbor has a virgin, and those who spy on me have been doing so for three years], guessing the Tang poem [It's always the feelings of Yumen Pass]. He wanted to offer a heavy reward of a hundred gold. In terms of the spirit of art, it seems that the works of the ancients are more profound and dignified than those of today, what is called [ancient and fragrant]. This is also rooted in the psychology of respecting the ancients, and cannot be said to be just a matter of the times.</p>
<p>I have a seal engraved with [Do not despise modern people and love the ancients], which seems to be a line of poetry. The poet who made this line of poetry has a good mind and attitude. His words "do not despise" have already broken the traditional concept of respecting the ancients, and have other ideas. But he can reconcile extremes, hold on to both sides, and use them in the middle. Not bad! This is also the mind and attitude that we artists should have.</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Philosophy of Buying Aviation Lottery Tickets <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>The National Government is holding lottery tickets for the construction of aviation highways, and this is the fifth time!</p>
<p>In the past four times, all those who bought them must have been like the full moon on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, happy for those who were happy and sad for those who were sad; and this time to the future ten thousand times, why would it be any different?</p>
<p>But today I am telling people who buy aviation lottery tickets with infinite joy and happiness; it is important to hold on to [the philosophy of buying aviation lottery tickets].</p>
<p>What I call the philosophy of aviation lottery tickets is nothing more than the following two principles;</p>
<p>(1) If you win this time, continue to come again next time; if you don't win this time, you must work harder next time.</p>
<p>(2) Winning the prize is a success; if you are happy not to become a public figure, you are also happy.</p>
<p>Look at that drop of water, it has a source and a destination; a discarded chess piece has a process of generation and a destination to drift away.</p>
<p>Just like the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, mighty and mighty, converging countless streams, flowing eastward into the sea; the sea also merges with the Pacific Ocean; the sun evaporates, turns into steam and forms clouds, drips rain, and becomes streams again, and rushes into the rivers, circulating and flowing, forming the main land system of the Eastern Hemisphere, and forming the entire cosmic spectacle. The changes never end. The spectacle never ends.</p>
<p>The life and death of human beings, and all states of things, are exactly like this; since there is you as a living being in the world, it is very natural that there will be an end to your life. All kinds of things, let them be natural, and treat yourself like water; especially the earth-shattering money craze, buying aviation lottery tickets!</p>
<p>Even if you can't really get your wish, you can still proudly boast and tell people; [I have donated several yuan to the aviation highway construction fund! ······ It's nothing more than being enthusiastic and fulfilling the obligations of a citizen! ] Or take out the used tickets and give them to friends and relatives, saying; [I bought this for you! ···· You got zero points, you have no money! ······ ]</p>
<p>In any case, in yourself, you can say; [I won the first prize! ]</p>

<p>— Chen Hua</p>
<p>[Love] is a golden badge, which will only shine dazzlingly on the bodies of the rich.</p>
<p>[Money] is the weapon to conquer everything of women, and also the iron lock of love.</p>
<p>[Eyeballs] are the wireless telegraphs that express spring's restlessness, and the strong heart needles that inspire men's courage.</p>
<p>[Hairs] are explorers on the human body, and the fuses for all outbursts.</p>
<p>[Wife] is the most practical name that modern women seek and discuss to listen to.</p>
<p>[Tears] are women's weapons to succeed in everything; nitric acid that dissolves men's strength.</p>
<p>[Big Company] is the place to build the foundation of love, using goods to overcome love.</p>
<p>[Dance Hall] is an aphrodisiac for love, which can boil the blood of men and women.</p>
<p>[Cinema] is a training center for love, where men and women practice imitating various methods.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>Generously Explaining His Mind, Forgetting His Family and Serving the Country, Jiang Liang Faces the Jade Mirror and Sighs for My Lost One</p>
<p>The four company commanders stood up tall, answering in unison with a "can" word. Bao Fang brought a few smiles, nodding his head and saying; That's good. I also said the same, there are no rubber men who work with my Bao Fang, all thumbs up. But then again, only we know this great truth, the brothers can't understand it, you have to explain this meaning to him well. Today, haven't the planes come yet? Speaking, he smiled faintly, and then said; It doesn't matter, I have already calculated this move. But you have to go and tell the brothers well, don't panic, you should take this matter lightly, Yin Daren smiled and said; We naturally know this. Bao Fang was very happy to see that the four company commanders were of one heart and helping himself. He also talked to them in detail for a while before letting them go. Zhao Ziqiang returned to the company headquarters, still full of ambition, feeling that since he was a soldier, he had to fight for a breath for the Chinese people. People live to be a hundred years old, and they still die, what is life, and besides, I have been on the front line several times, and I am still alive, so fighting is not necessarily dangerous. If we win two battles with our people and earn some reputation for the Northeast Army, then it would be a matter of both fame and fortune, he thought casually, and unknowingly lay down on that big earthen bed. But when his head was raised, he was facing the yellow earthen wall, and the red paper couplets pasted on the wall, shot into his eyes, and then he remembered the joyous couplets in his own home, and along with that he also thought of his beloved wife, Guizhi. I have inspired patriotism here, preparing to sacrifice myself, what if there is a little danger, what will she do? She would lose her husband after only five days of marriage. It was too tragic. He remembered that when she was sent to the long-distance bus station, her face was covered with tears, but with a smile. How uncomfortable she was in her heart. He married such a beautiful wife, but he could not enjoy it himself. This life is in vain. (342)</p>
<h3 id="e283">Another Method for Treating Goldfish with White Spot Disease <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Canyu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wu Jiren's [A Tale of Protecting Goldfish in Cold Weather] in this publication, I deeply admire his rich experience in raising fish. However, electrotherapy is difficult for treating white spots on the body of the fish, and ink treatment is also inconvenient. Here is a simple and effective method, recorded as follows, for adoption by fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In the hot summer, take several pieces of mud brick, immerse them in a urine pit, and after three days, take them out and dry them, then soak them again, and dry them again. Repeat this four or five times, until the color of the brick fully absorbs the urine and turns black; then dry it extremely well and store it in the room, waiting for the warm spring, to put it at the bottom of the tank. In warm weather, the fish's body is almost always rubbing against the top or bottom of the tank due to illness, so putting this brick can make it rub against it; then the fish's body will no longer develop mold spots, and even if mold has already grown, it can be eliminated immediately after rubbing. I have raised fish for more than ten years, and since I obtained this method, the lively golden scales of the gods have no more fear of dying from mold. According to ancient methods of raising fish, all used yellow sand pit tanks that had been stored with manure, and those with piled pit sand were considered the best; the idea is to take its full saline content, which is beneficial to the health of the fish's body?</p>
<p>Furthermore, to prevent severe cold and freezing, a wooden tank cover can be used to cover the mouth of the tank, and then rice straw can be used as a mat and covered on the lid; so that the grass will not scatter on the surface of the water, and the gaps in the wooden lid will still allow air to circulate. The body of the tank is further wrapped in layers of this straw mat, which can be removed after spring. If this can be done, then the tank water is guaranteed not to freeze. Because Mr. Wu's method is not perfect, it is attached here.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Everything is a Deception? <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Recently, a film star, disheartened, committed suicide. In her last moments, she said, "Everything is a deception!"</p>
<p>"Deception" is the enemy of "honesty." It is a vast chasm that hinders human evolution and the cause of countless evils in the world.</p>
<p>I myself once said, "People are deceived when they are young, and when they grow up, they deceive others." But I eventually felt that my words were too generalized! And the saying "everything is a deception" is also too much! Although in this transitional era, "deception" has become a prevalent social malady, we cannot, because deception is prevalent, conclude that there is no truth in the universe. At the very least, one cannot admit to oneself that one is a deception. Such a subjective mentality is enough to create tragedies like the suicide of that film star.</p>
<p>Great creation! Supreme maternal love! Passionate friendship! ...... Can you say that these are all deceptions? We must believe that everything in the world is real, and deception is just a fleeting bubble, although there are indeed many people living by trickery in the present world.</p>
<p>However, the pathological development of deception and the decline of the capitalist system are directly proportional; therefore, the issue of deception is also a serious problem in society today.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>(IV) The Carnival of Nice</p>
<p>The people of the French provinces love outdoor life. When various folk or religious festivals arrive, they often hold various games, processions, and competitions in the streets and squares. In the past, during religious pilgrimages, there were often many believers wearing various colors of penitential robes. [This was a coarse cloth gown without sleeves, with a cowl-like hat hanging on the back, covering the head and only revealing the face. Today, monks in monastic orders still wear this type of penitential robe, such as former Chinese Prime Minister Lu Zhengxiang, who often wears it now.] This has not yet disappeared. In various concerts preserving folk customs and music, we can still often see various ancient inherited musical instruments.</p>
<p>Many cities and villages still hold various bizarre festivals every year, such as the "Monster Model Image" in Tarascon (in southern France, during the Saint Martha's festival, there are often performances of various monsters and beasts in the marching pageants), the Brahman-style procession of Saint Mary's, the ceremony of celebrating the sea, and the "Telling Tall Tales" in Saint-Tropez, etc., all of which are extremely interesting contest decorations.</p>
<p>But among all the festivals held in the southern French provinces, the most wonderful and exciting is the "Carnival" of Nice.</p>
<p>The term "Carnival" is a transliteration of the French word "Carnaval" and refers to a period of revelry. Originally, it was a day for worshiping the god of wine. This festival usually takes place a few days before the Catholic Lent, so some people translate it as "Meat Festival" or "Mardi Gras". On this day, according to customs in various parts of Europe, everyone can eat, drink, shout, make noise, dance, and frolic to their heart's content. The "Carnival" festivals in Venice, Italy, and Nice, France, are famous worldwide.</p>
<p>Many people who love to seek pleasure mostly rush to Nice in early February, specifically to participate in the annual "Carnival." It has the same meaning as people from the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China going to Hangzhou to catch the "Incense Tide".</p>
<p>In Nice, the Carnival is jointly prepared and organized by the local city hall and the municipal committee. The purpose is to attract wealthy foreign tourists to visit Nice, so that the market can prosper.</p>
<p>The people of France originally have a character that loves to seek pleasure, and they often like to seize the opportunity of holidays to desperately seek happiness. When they arrive at the "Carnival" festival, they want to play and seek happiness more than ever. Because this is a day of unrestrained eating and drinking, the streets and shops are decorated with colorful colors during the day, and at night, the lights are lit up, shining like daylight. They organize various strange-shaped parades, singing and walking around the streets. You can dance on the road, you can throw flowers at women, you can dress up and disguise as various characters, wear strange and ridiculous costumes, and run around wildly, stopping unfamiliar women to dance wildly. Adults have become naughty children, specializing in teasing and joking with others, or throwing flowers at each other, or dragging beautiful women from vehicles to hug and kiss. Because everyone wears masks, they cannot recognize each other's true faces. During this season, many infatuated men and resentful women get married because of this, which is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The best-looking thing is all kinds of strange and bizarre masquerade floats. In the 1933 parade, there were many strange masquerade characters. For example, on a camel-shaped car, a snake-head ring was hung high on the camel's hump, and a young man in sports shorts sat in the center, accompanied by a girl decorated as a princess holding a large feather fan. On a horse-head boat, a pot-bellied Parisian male god hugged a petite Helen goddess. A singing cicada was begging a stingy ant for dry food. A monkey king was drooling as he looked at the cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs under his seat. A bald head and a big nose were covered with many mosquitoes. (Probably a philosopher) A long-haired and long-bearded musician was riding on a three-mouthed bird and dancing wildly while conducting.</p>

<h3 id="e286">A Word for the National Goods Industry and Those Who Use National Goods <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>When we see the statistics on imports and exports for January, the trade deficit reaches 40,960,729 yuan, which is greater than the trade deficit statistics for the fourth year of the Republic of China. Everyone will say in unison, "This is terrible!" In President Roosevelt's recovery plan, cash will be absorbed and silver prices will be raised. Our country's survey of silver bars stored in this city shows that two-thirds are held by foreigners. Everyone will be even more shocked and say, "This is terrible!" After the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement, foreign goods were dumped and enemy goods were even more popular. Their movements were like mercury spilling on the ground, infiltrating everywhere, even in remote villages and mountainous areas. And the general unenterprising elements are greedy for cheapness, quenching thirst with poison, or dislike national goods for being inferior, preferring to buy foreign goods, thinking they are beautiful, and there are even those who only use foreign goods. Speaking of this, everyone will say even more, "This is terrible, unenterprising things, shameless traitors!" Those foreigners are really scary! If we talk about my country's agriculture, which has a long history and is recognized by the world, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce released grain import statistics for the 22nd year, with a total value of 274,303,434 yuan last month. According to reports, the freight obtained by various countries in China due to shipping last year was statistically 2,149,880,983 taels. Everyone listens and is dumbfounded, saying that if this continues, it will be really "terrible!" In addition, the silk industry has plummeted, the national goods market is declining, and internal wars are frequent, the communist bandits are rampant, the borders are shrinking day by day, and foreign insults are increasing. Everyone is urgently shouting, "This is terrible!" "This is terrible!" Really "terrible!" What does this one hundred and twenty "terrible" and one hundred and eight thousand "terrible" mean? Is it more powerful than three thousand planes and forty tons of poison gas?</p>
<p>Try to analyze the meaning of these three words "This is terrible", which contain infinite sadness, one hundred and twenty unwillingness, and are trapped in helplessness. In other words, it is a manifestation of following old ways and drifting along, being at the mercy of others. But when we think of the glory of the nation's future, and to strive for self-improvement, who is willing to mislead themselves and be ridiculed for a five-minute craze, and for the Eastern Sleeping Lion not to awaken? Our country has vast land, abundant resources, and a large population, and is famous in the world. Heroes have a place to use their skills, and the future is always bright. National steps can always be promoted! The national spirit can always be promoted! It's just that if we always say "This is terrible", then there is really nothing we can do. Some people say that the British do it first and then talk about it; the Germans only do it and don't talk about it; the French ...... the Chinese talk about it and don't do it, which is a true portrayal of the three words "This is terrible". Therefore, from now on, as long as we work hard and forge ahead, we are not afraid of hardships, we are not afraid of the trend, and regardless of everything, we start from individual practical actions and practical struggles, then we will have a savior.</p>
<p>We merchants, in this era of commercial warfare, our position is so important, our qualifications are so noble, and the time to strive for progress cannot be delayed any longer. Those who call themselves members of the national goods industry are even more leaders in commerce. "The days are passing," "The years do not wait for me," the sales channels for foreign goods are ultimately within the scope of our national territory. I still remember reading in the newspaper the other day that the Japanese, due to the world's active boycott of goods, have declared to the League of Nations that they will withdraw from the tariff truce to show their retaliation. With their qualifications as an advanced country, how patriotic are the Japanese people, and they are still actively carrying out this plan. What about our country? We don't want to dump national goods into foreign markets, and we can't even do the minimum of selling our own goods to ourselves. How ashamed are we? Are we even worthy of being called Chinese citizens? Therefore, our association established a commodity exhibition hall in the tenth year of the Republic of China; later, we held national goods exhibitions and temporary national goods malls, a total of seven times. In recent years, we have also exhibited national goods in Hangzhou, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, Bengbu, Jinan, Hankou and other places to promote national attention and awakening. In June of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, we opened the national goods mall on the lower floor of the commodity exhibition hall on North Henan Road in this city. Yesterday, the national goods mall in Nanshi also opened. We are very supportive of the China National Goods Company and the Shanghai National Goods Company on Nanjing Road, as well as other merchants and factories in this and other places that specialize in selling and manufacturing national goods, because the more of these malls, the better. They are the lifeline of our country, so we must value them. As for the efforts of our association, it is nothing more than being forced by the demands of the times. As the saying goes, "The tiger is already at our heels, we really don't have time to see if it's male or female." However, although this is the case, our association is a group of merchants, and we only have the instinct to promote national goods, and we have very few opportunities to study them, and we don't have the strength to produce them. In practice, we rely entirely on our merchants, factories, and compatriots who use national goods. All the past things are like yesterday's death; all the future things are like today's birth. Everyone works together, moves forward, and no matter how foreign goods are dumped, how beautiful they are, how convenient and durable they are, I only use my national goods! Merchants and factories must, on the one hand, take into account the purchasing power of customers; on the other hand, they must carefully study how to make their products excellent and fast; on the one hand, even if they are subject to various encroachments of foreign goods, they must exhaust their efforts and use all their strength to find a way out of death. With such a two-pronged approach, our national goods will have a turning point, and the national situation can develop, and "terrible" things will naturally gradually decrease, until they disappear.</p>
<p>This year is the Year of Women's National Goods, which happens to be the auspicious period for the birth of our association's Nanshi National Goods Mall. I would like to express my sincere wishes to my compatriots in the national goods industry and to the compatriots who use national goods for unlimited progress!</p>
<h3 id="e287">The Past and Future of National Goods Malls <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yansong</p>
<p>Ever since the opening of the sea, foreign insults have become increasingly urgent. People of insight have realized that the economic aggression of imperialism is more serious than politics. So they rose up to advocate the boycott of goods movement. However, since the fourth year of the Republic of China, there have been more than ten boycotts of goods in total. However, foreign goods still fill the market as before. The customs trade deficit has also increased year by year. I know that the boycott of goods is not enough to be effective. So they rose up to promote national goods. The national goods mall came into being accordingly. And it is the backbone of promoting national goods.</p>
<p>The existence of the national goods mall in Shanghai dates back to ten years ago. At that time, there was a national goods market in Nanshi. And the original site of Mayushan Company on Nanjing Road also had the establishment of a national goods mall. Ultimately, due to poor organization. They all disappeared after a flash. Foreign goods further used their dumping policy. Flowing freely within the country. As a result, wealth is exhausted. The people are increasingly trapped. National goods are becoming increasingly decadent. In view of this, our association, in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, demarcated a site in the commodity exhibition hall north of Tianhou Palace. Established a national goods mall. Painstaking management. Extensive publicity. Thus aroused the public's psychology of loving and using national goods. And the sales channels of national goods. Gradually developed. National goods markets. Also emerged one after another. Now our association has established a second national goods mall at the original site of the County Chamber of Commerce in front of Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. I believe that at this time of the Women's National Goods Year. And national goods malls. Springing up one after another like mushrooms after rain. It is a good phenomenon in the national goods industry.</p>
<p>Although. This is only in Shanghai. However, the dumping of foreign goods. Deep into the interior. National goods malls in the interior. There are also some established. But there are not many. Languid. As a result, the customs trade deficit. Still as before. But recently, the national goods movement in the interior. The cooperative movement. Advocacy is quite laborious. Therefore, the future of national goods malls. It will certainly reach the interior. From cities to townships. From ordinary malls. And become cooperative stores. If you don't believe me. You can wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Overview of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Goods Mall <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Goods Mall. Founded on June 6th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, it is located in the commodity exhibition hall building north of Tianhou Palace Bridge. Initially, there was only one floor of shop space. The following year, it was expanded into two floors. This year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs moved to the city center. The original site of the former County Chamber of Commerce was vacated. After a regular meeting, it was decided. That is, to establish a second mall. Named Nanshi National Goods Mall. Its organizational situation. And the size of the area. It is roughly the same as the first mall in the north of the city. As a result, the two malls are divided between the north and south. The supply of national goods to the whole city. It is more convenient. Examining the association's national goods sales agency. Its history dates back more than ten years. The initial commodity exhibition hall opened on November 1st of the tenth year of the Republic of China. At the same time, the first exhibition was held. A collection of products from all over the country. Displayed in one hall. It is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai. Chinese and foreign people. Upon visiting the institute. They all praised the progress of Chinese craftsmanship. Frequently ask to buy. Afterwards, there are more and more special letters and inquiries. However, the exhibits of the commodity exhibition hall. All are long-term displays. Anyone can visit. It seems that it cannot be used for visitors to choose and buy at will. In order to promote the sales channels of the producers. And for the convenience of buyers of high-quality national goods. In July of the eleventh year of the Republic of China. After deliberation by the Commodity Exhibition Hall Committee. Established a sales department. And designate the lower central part of the exhibition hall. As a place of business. That is, on October 6th of this year. It opened simultaneously with the silk exhibition. Major national goods manufacturers in this and other places. There are more than one hundred companies that send products to the association and request to sell them on their behalf. However, due to insufficient publicity. And lack of shop space. Business has not been fully developed. But since the establishment. For many years. Have achieved considerable results. In between</p>
<p>From the fourteenth to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. When the National Goods Exhibition is held every year. There is also a temporary national goods mall attached. Each session lasts about one month. The amount of business. Ultimately reached hundreds of thousands of yuan. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China. After the city chamber of commerce's regular meeting. The original sales department of the commodity exhibition hall will be closed. Changed to National Goods Mall. Take the entire lower level as the place of business. Attract major national goods manufacturers. Set up counters to sell high-quality products. Perfect organization. Extensive publicity. That is, it opened on June 6th of this year. The entire market is divided into more than twenty departments. Collect all kinds of goods. Reached thousands of kinds. The business is very prosperous. The following year. The commodity exhibition hall building was expanded to four floors. Expanded the mall to two floors. (The third and fourth floors are still exhibition halls.) The location is getting bigger. The more goods it can hold. And the business is becoming more and more developed. On March 21st of this year. The Nanshi National Goods Mall also opened. The organization is more perfect. Therefore, the situation at the beginning. Record it for reference for those who care about national goods.</p>

<p>— Yinge</p>
<p>The relationship between silver prices and national goods is very close. In other words, the silver price is the opposite of the currency price of each country. If the silver price is high, the foreign currency is cheap. If the foreign currency is cheap, the foreign goods are cheap. Foreign goods are cheap and easy to sell to China, which is called dumping. Like seawater pouring over. 700 million in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, 700 million again in the 23rd year, and again in the 24th year... No matter if it is the Year of Men's National Goods or the Year of Women's National Goods, dumping and more dumping, the entire China will have no life. This disaster. People who are not very careful about the economy may not fully feel its harm. In fact, its severity is even above the Northeast issue. Now all countries are engaged in dumping, of course, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia are not polite. Among them, the most outstanding is Japan. Alas, Japan is the enemy. Japanese goods are enemy goods. Why do your noble countrymen welcome everything from staple cotton yarn and white sugar to children's goods? Needless to say, it is because Japanese goods are cheap. You think, why can Japanese goods be cheap? This is of course because the Japanese yen has fallen in price. The reason for the price drop is of course because of their suspension of exchange policy. However, it is still the Chinese who fall into his trap and help the tyrant. Since the Seiyukai cabinet suspended the exchange of the yen, although the market price of Japanese exchange has not been seen in ordinary Japanese altars in Shanghai for a long time. However, foreign banks, especially Japanese banks, are doing business as usual. (This cannot blame foreigners) When rich Chinese people are in this year of economic depression, all kinds of businesses feel that it is not easy to make profits. When they see that the Japanese yen has suspended exchange, they know that it will definitely fall in price, so everyone sends money to foreign banks. Throw out the Japanese yen. This huge amount of money, directly and indirectly, will reach the hands of the Japanese. Since Chinese businessmen throw out the yen together, its price will definitely be suppressed, the more they throw out, the more suppressed. As a result, the yen has fallen sharply, and all Japanese goods are very cheap. This is clearly using Chinese capital to help Japan's dumping. This is called secret suicide.</p>

<p>There should be everything you need for daily use, why do Chinese people have to rely on foreign goods?</p>
<p>Guan Yu realized that in promoting national goods, our women's world has a heavy responsibility, and once gathered comrades to launch the Women's Promotion of National Goods Association, four years ago, and the results were nothing, I feel deeply ashamed! Now it is increasingly valued by society, and this year has been designated as the Year of Women's National Goods, so the responsibility of the women's world is even greater, and we can only work hard to move forward and engage in advocacy. The other day, I visited the city's national goods companies with Zhu Lin and other comrades. Due to time constraints, I only went to four places; first to the China National Goods Company, where Mr. Li Kangnian and Shen Jinghui received us. The goods displayed in each department are very complete, and the patterns and colors of the silk and satin are all moving and beautiful. There are also many kinds of woolen cloth, and other things such as bakelite and jade ware, children's toys, and Kangyuan iron cans are exquisite and lovely. Next, I went to the China Chemical Industry Society, where Mr. Hong Shaoyu received me and led me to the chemical laboratory, where I was just experimenting with the products; then to the packaging room, where the female workers were all energetic and engaged in work. I felt that my country's imports of cosmetics, according to the customs investigation report, are worth millions of yuan a year! How can the products of the Chemical Industry Society be sold throughout the country to save this huge leakage! This is all in the hands of our women's world. Next, I went to the Shanghai National Goods Company, where Mr. Lu Qisheng received me. Its scale is not inferior to that of the China National Goods Company. The goods displayed in each factory are exquisite. Finally, I went to the city chamber of commerce's national goods market, where Mr. Zhu received me. I took a tour of the goods in each department, and they were all excellent. Looking at the above four places, there should be everything you need for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and they are exquisite and suitable. Why abandon them and not buy them, and sit and watch my country's money flow abroad? I record it casually to introduce it, and I hope that our women's world will encourage each other!</p>
<h3 id="e291">From the Responsibility of Urban Women to the "Year of Women's National Goods" <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Since the gradual influx of Western customs and the advocacy of equality between men and women, the shackles of women for thousands of years have been lifted as a result. The status of women. Therefore, it has increased. That is, the responsibility of women. Therefore, it is also more important than before.</p>
<p>Because, men and women are equal, naturally, the responsibilities that men should bear must also be borne by women. Therefore, the responsibility of women is relieved of shackles and increased in status due to the equality of men and women. And the responsibilities that are borne. It is also more important than before. This was originally an expected thing. It is also due to the awareness of women, which is indeed a very good phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, this very good phenomenon is only in the city</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>It can be seen, and in the remote interior, even today, there are still many places that do not get rid of the atmosphere of the eighteenth century! Even if there are a few places where the atmosphere is more open, aren't they just following the lead of the city? Because, the city is ultimately the place to open up the atmosphere first. In other words, most of the atmosphere in the interior flows in from the city. Then, the people in the city can be called the pioneers and the pioneers. The people in the interior are naturally the latecomers. Here, I feel that the responsibility of urban women is actually much greater than that of inland women!</p>
<p>Now let's not talk about anything else, let's talk about clothing first. For example, now Shanghai is popular with a 1934-style "Modern New Dress." We can undoubtedly be sure that this "Modern New Dress" will soon become popular in the interior as well. This is the city opening up the atmosphere first, and then the interior learning from it. There has never been a case where the interior opened up the atmosphere first, and then the city learned from it. Therefore, so I want to feel the responsibility of urban women is indeed much greater than the responsibility of inland women! Then, this year is the "Year of Women's National Goods." I hope that the women in the city can realize the importance of their own responsibility, and from now on, they must always and resolutely promote and believe in national wages, so as to be a model for women in the interior!</p>
<h3 id="e292">The New Life Movement and National Goods <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Recently, the whole country has been advocating the New Life Movement, which is a glimmer of hope for national rejuvenation and is very worthy of promotion. The biggest goal of the New Life Movement is a simple life, a frugal atmosphere, the elimination of extravagance, the rejection of romance, and especially the importance of everyone setting an example and starting from themselves. Starting from wearing national goods themselves. Only those who can wear national goods are worthy of talking about the New Life and being advocates of the New Life Movement. Otherwise, it is a Westernized life, a noble life, a life of national subjugation and extinction. I feel that recently some provincial governments have indeed shown some vigor, such as Lu Han's promotion of simplicity and thrift, and the prohibition of extravagance, from officials to the people, can wear national goods clothing. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Hunan Provincial Government are also promoting the cloth clothing movement, formulating regulations, and leading by example. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to implement the New Life, has required all employees to use national goods uniforms from April 1, and there are measures to ban women's enchanting clothing. This news is all manifested under the New Life Movement. In addition to being happy, our national goods industry also hopes that the central and local governments and the people of all regions will also pay attention to other edible items in addition to clothing. If you want to have a good treat, why use Oriental shark fin and foreign cigarettes? If you want to drink well, why drink foreign brandy and whiskey? Even a washbasin, a piece of soap, a box of matches, a bottle of snowflake cream, why use imported goods? The paper you write on, the pen and ink you use, why use imported goods? This is not only a vain habit, a showy temper, but also a lazy, complacent, and unambitious spirit, and a lack of determination to reform. Most of these people have too much contact with foreigners, are too deeply poisoned, are too old, and unconsciously, they have become sinners of the national goods industry. I hope everyone will pay attention to and correct this bad habit and bad temper, so that it can be called the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Dedicated to the Women of the [Women's National Products Year] <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>The National Products Year has passed, but I dare not say anything about the past year. However, regarding the approaching [Women's National Products Year], I can’t help but utter a few words. Because the reality is before my eyes, forcing me to speak!</p>
<p>Before I unfold the main text, I must first look back at the achievements of last year's [National Products Year]. Those who sell enemy goods still sell them in large quantities, willing to betray their conscience and act as unscrupulous merchants. What can be done about it! Those who love to use imported or enemy goods do not seem to have their patriotism aroused by the call for [National Products Year] or change their attitude. The most hateful are those shameless merchants who blatantly disguise enemy goods and pass them off as national products for sale! It's truly reached the extreme of madness. I don't know where their conscience is, where their personality exists? In the past, there was the line in Tang poetry, [Merchant girls do not know the sorrow of national subjugation], but now I want to change it to [Merchants do not know the sorrow of national subjugation]. If you go to the Jianghai Customs to check the statistics of imported foreign goods, I believe the import amount for 1933 will definitely not be less than in previous years.</p>
<p>Not long ago, according to the guidance office of the International Trade Bureau, from January to September 1933, the import of foreign wines and cigarettes reached a weak ten million gold yuan. The import of rouge, perfume, and other cosmetics amounted to 1,396,684 yuan, with French goods accounting for the majority, followed by Japanese and American goods. Seeing the above two statistics of consumables, I was speechless. Our upper-class Chinese, young masters, young ladies, and mistresses, are ultimately quite extravagant. Although they are in a situation of internal and external troubles, natural disasters and man-made disasters, their indulgence in luxury remains unchanged. Those above the middle class are not short of people who live extravagantly. One garment costs a hundred gold, and one meal costs ten gold. It still cannot be called extravagant. It is necessary to pursue extreme luxury, with foreign goods being the only way to show off. Therefore, the import of foreign consumables has increased year by year. [A rich man's dinner is half a year's food for a poor family], who can deny it?</p>
<p>This year is [Women's National Products Year]. Then, I should ask those wives, mistresses, and young ladies to change their attitude of loving foreign goods and disliking national products, and to promote national products as much as possible! Last year's [National Products Year] was like this, let's see about [Women's National Products Year]!</p>
<p>Some people advocate that promoting national products should start with women first, which shows the importance of women's relationship with national products. Women are the mothers of the nation. I respectfully offer a sincere heart here to wish the women of the [Women's National Products Year] to fulfill their responsibility of promoting national products based on their natural duty as the mothers of the nation, and not just pursue fashion while abandoning the mission they should bear.</p>
<h3 id="e294">National Products Road and National Products Week <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>Doing things under the slogan [The revolution has not yet succeeded] naturally requires some revolutionary spirit; moreover, who can refute the promotion of the National Products Year.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, to promote national products, one should work with a decisive spirit. [Meetings], [posting slogans], [exhibitions], [big sales] have already shown that [it is not very effective]. This [road to failure] does not seem to need to be taken again. To wake up from the dream and change the situation, one must find another [way out].</p>
<p>In my stupid mind, I have thought of several methods. Although they seem a bit radical, good medicine tastes bitter, and when you first take it, it certainly won't taste as good as [candied arsenic]. I hastily and disrespectfully write them below:</p>
<p>(1) National Products Week: The central government is the head of the whole country, and its influence is most likely to achieve the effect of [changing customs and habits]. Therefore, I request that when holding [Commemorative Weeks], it be stipulated that all attendees must wear national products. (I have never shown my face at weekly meetings, and I don't know if the clothing is uniform? In principle, for the sake of solemnity, such venues should comply with regulations and attend in national formal attire, | | blue robe and black mandarin jacket | | is the right thing to do. Beforehand, people should be assigned to check at the check-in point. If they are wearing foreign goods, they will not be allowed to attend. The staff, fearing the punishment of not attending, will of course quickly change their ways.</p>
<p>At the same time, the central party headquarters seems to be able to do the same, because it is the highest authority leading the people. As long as these two gatherings are tentatively renamed [National Products Week] during this year's [Commemorative Week], I think it will definitely have a great impact.</p>
<p>(2) National Products Road: In cities where foreign forces cannot interfere (or start from the capital), choose a prosperous street and designate it as [National Products Road]. At both ends of this road, national product promotion organizations should send people daily, together with the police, to pay attention to observing pedestrians. If there are people wearing foreign goods from head to toe, flaunting them in the market, they will be refused to walk on the National Products Road. (Those who disobey orders will be punished according to the regulations for violating police orders.)</p>
<p>Shops selling foreign goods on National Products Road are only allowed to close, not open. It is hoped that they will be gradually eliminated, so as to achieve the goal of National Products Road exclusively selling national products.</p>
<p>Enough, enough, don't have too many methods, just do it. If someone agrees, I can write in more detail and discuss it with everyone.</p>
<p>Doing this not only shows the government's genuine spirit of promoting national products, but also shows the people's determination to work together to save the country. If this minimum requirement cannot be met, and the easiest work to implement is not willing to be done, then there is no need to say anything else that sounds good.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Two Hopes for the Year of Women's National Products <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yangyao said, [Using national products is certainly not limited to men and women, but the power to use them lies entirely in the hands of women.] Mr. Pan's words are correct.</p>
<p>Based on our past experience, [women's spending power is several times higher than that of men. Whether in cosmetics or clothing, women spend more than men. This is not that we men are deliberately finding fault with women, but it is indeed an undeniable fact. Last year's customs report of more than 14 million yuan in cosmetic imports is ironclad proof that women's spending power is stronger than that of men.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone feels that promoting national products should start with women first. If 70-80% of women across the country can deeply understand the importance of hoping to use national products and rise up and practice it, China's national products movement will definitely achieve great success. Local coordination and other submissions to the government to designate this year as the Year of Women's National Products is this meaning.</p>
<p>Now, the Year of Women's National Products has been confirmed! Women, how should you rise up and work hard to make the Year of Women's National Products live up to its name and not be in vain?</p>
<p>The author would like to offer two opinions here to the women of the times, hoping that they will accept them:</p>
<p>(1) The concept of worshiping foreign goods: The first prerequisite for using national products is to eliminate the mentality of worshiping foreign countries and believing in foreign goods, and establish a mentality of trusting Chinese goods. It is necessary to cultivate the concept of not buying non-Chinese goods and not using non-Chinese goods. Only then can national products in the Year of Women's National Products be sold smoothly, and the current sluggish state of industry and commerce can be relieved.</p>
<p>(2) To confirm the importance of one's own responsibility: At present, many women have a wrong concept, thinking that saving the country is a matter for men, and promoting national products is also a matter for men. What does it have to do with us women? In fact, this is a big mistake! We must know that saving the country is a matter of cooperation between men and women, not something that men can do alone, and the patriotic movement of promoting national products cannot be done without women! Therefore, my second hope is that women recognize the importance of their own responsibility and recognize that the patriotic national products movement cannot be undertaken without women. Only in this way can we create great achievements in the patriotic national products movement from our own beliefs.</p>
<p>Women? The situation is urgent! The country is in danger! Don't yearn for the fashion of using foreign goods anymore, and fall into the dangerous situation of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Shanghai Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory. The earliest and largest rubber factory established in the country. The main factory is located at Xujiahui Road, No. 1103. There are four branch factories and raw material factories. Its Double Coin brand galoshes, sneakers, running shoes, and hot water bottles are sold throughout the country and Southeast Asian ports. Recently, the factory has also launched a new type of rubber raincoat fabric. The fabric width is thirty-eight inches. All colors are available. The colors are bright and vibrant. The quality is strong and durable. This item was originally mostly an enemy good. Each yard was priced at about one yuan. The ones now produced by the factory sell for only seventy to seventy-five cents per yard. There are already a large number of products available to be sold on the market. It is said that the factory, in order to let all sectors understand genuine national products, will allow those who have a letter of introduction from a formal organization to visit the factory to see the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>— Shi Qi</p>
<p>Buddhism seems to be very popular lately. In the past forty or fifty years, people's livelihoods and national plans have been turned upside down, and ordinary people are probably a bit troubled, exhausted, and feel that it is not like the world anymore. Then, seeking peace, seeking complete enlightenment, seeking to return to one's original face, is exactly this time. Drawing clear springs from the source of a fresh religion to quench spiritual thirst, like travelers in the desert, can roughly explain this reason!</p>
<p>Thinking back to before and after the Russian Revolution, there were always passionate dreams and the sorrow of disillusionment. After each failure, many reformers fled, suffered, and turned into nihilists, pursuing sexual desire, like the character of Sanin written by Artzybashev. However, the emotions of our Eastern nations are slightly different. Once they have failed or are oppressed to the point of barely being able to live, the only escape and comfort is to take refuge in the Three Jewels, or become a lay Buddhist, gradually entrusting their spirit to another world, isolating themselves from the present world. There are countless such figures in history.</p>
<p>But what distinguishes Buddhism from other religions is that it is all-encompassing and includes everything. For example, the eight negations of the Middle Treatise and the two emptinesses of the Only Consciousness theory, when it comes to the result, there is no law and no being, and all appearances are illusions. Then what do people do in the world, why don't they die? Neither born nor dead, neither alive nor dead, there is no so-called life and death.</p>
<p>We must absolutely not ignore this great force, which can be used to reform society, transcending life and death to achieve great courage and fearlessness, becoming a fighter for light, an eliminator of darkness, and a builder of a new society. Faith and reason unite to become a great force, strong yet peaceful, sweeping away everything, destroying everything, and building everything!</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I have decided to move.</p>
<p>It's like undertaking a revolutionary undertaking, decided after several hesitations. Knowing clearly that this action cannot be understood by ordinary people, I don't want to make things too strange, so I confessed to others:</p>
<p>[I'm going to move.]</p>
<p>After saying this sentence, I didn't wait for people to ask the reason and continued. I said that I can't sleep well at night in the school, and my heart is like being clamped in an iron plate, being oppressed. I really feel funny myself, no matter what I say, can people not allow it? Moreover, my mental disorder has long been registered in everyone's mind. I told them the address of my new home, but the situation of the room is for them to discover themselves. Now it's time to say something about the new home. It's a relative's outbuilding not far from the school. I also spent a lot of effort to live in this small house. They didn't let me live in it, saying that this small house was too undignified for my status, and they were afraid that others would criticize them for treating guests poorly, but I finally lived here.</p>
<p>A room leaning against the east wall, with mountains outside the wall. The room is so small that stretching out your arms can connect the north and south walls. A few bed boards are placed against the east wall, and a small table occupies a small gap under the east wall. There are no windows, nothing else. When entering the door, you have to be careful of your head, and you have to be careful that the door pushes you back, because a corner of the small table prevents it from being fully opened. It is said that it should be very pleasant to be in a high-rise building, leaning on a deck chair, sipping tea and watching the sea, or chatting with a few people, but I moved down from this high-rise building. I am happy like this. Under the sun, I feel suffocated. In this way, after class, returning to this small resting place, everything will be calm. Closing the small door tightly, not seeing anything, at this time, I become a free person.</p>
<p>Every morning I get up early and run to school, just bypassing some mountains and forests, and then run back in the evening. I feel a deep interest inside, suppressing the darkness in my heart and forcing myself to say:</p>
<p>[A young student].</p>
<p>Sharing the bed is a worker. We are about the same age. From his foolish smile, I found the deepest comfort. He likes to sing, but it can't really be called singing. I asked him:</p>
<p>[What's the appeal of singing opera?]</p>
<p>[The appeal is great... I can't say it... It's better than getting married!] Sometimes he also recites poetry. Once he recited...</p>
<p>[During the Qingming season, it rains endlessly, the travelers on the road are heartbroken...]</p>
<p>[What does this rain sentence mean?] I asked him.</p>
<p>[What does it mean? When it rains, the road is difficult to walk, and the travelers are worried.]</p>
<p>He said he had studied in a private school for eight years. He laughed at me for reading Mao Shi and Zuo Zhuan... He said he had read these books long ago, but now he doesn't know anything.</p>
<p>I remember the first night I moved in, the little aunts and sisters came to congratulate me on my new home with flowers and tea. They said very tactfully, this is the first night, and we won't bother you in the future.</p>
<p>The next day, someone came to see me, but couldn't find me. It turned out that my small house was covered by the high-rise building. When he got to the room, he first patrolled everywhere with his eyes, and finally said... [It's very interesting, it would be better if there was a window].</p>
<p>As usual, I couldn't sleep well at night. A pair of eyes turned frantically. Fortunately, this is at night (when is it not at night?) On my own bed, my thoughts can be freely up and down, underground and then above the sky.</p>
<p>[Haven't you been to the front line?] Someone is asking.</p>
<p>[Yes; I am sick now. But my heart is not dead!]</p>
<p>Answering, I remembered Yinri again.</p>
<h3 id="e299">My Confession <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahai</p>
<p>After Zhuan Peng published his confession, I had a very serious reflection, and my friends also had very severe criticisms of me. Although I understood the causes and circumstances before and after this incident and the intentions of those [righteous] gentlemen, from my own standpoint, what I should do at this time is to mercilessly dissect my past behavior, and very honestly judge myself before embarking on a solid new path. As a result of this self-reflection, I feel that there is still a need to speak again.</p>
<p>First of all, I must state that my attitude when I wrote that article [About My Creation] last time was not sincere, just like many of my past behaviors were not honest. To make the facts clearer, I will now very frankly and sincerely explain to the readers.</p>
<p>When I heard the news that my novels were all written by Xu Jun, I asked him if he had spread it himself, but he strongly denied it:</p>
<p>[There is no such thing, absolutely no such thing. If this matter is publicized, it will not only be harmful to you, but also to me, because people will say that we are colluding with each other.]</p>
<p>Just like believing in myself, I believed that his words were reliable. But soon our friend Peng Chenghui told me that Zhuan Peng had seen a message about me posted in Cultural Train by a certain gentleman, which was very unfavorable to me, and if it was published, he would be very sorry for me. At this time, I began to realize that so-called friends are like this. But I didn't say anything. A few days later, I received a letter from Zhuan Peng from Hangzhou:</p>
<p>[Many guys are jealous of you and like to make trouble, and things have finally stirred up. Yesterday I saw Ba Jin, and Ba Jin also asked about it. Because of this matter, I have been uneasy for several days, and I have also discussed it with Chenghui, Zhenliang and other friends, but there is no good strategy. I have been friends with you for six or seven years, like brothers, but this matter seems inconvenient to talk about in person, for fear of making you angry. Your ability to do things is above mine, I hope you can find a way to quell this storm...]</p>
<p>I got this letter and felt very funny. After seeing Mr. Shi Heng's article and finding out that Qingdaofu was the pseudonym of that gentleman, I realized that the occurrence of this incident was not accidental, but a planned coercion towards me; at the same time, I also understood why Zhuan Peng was avoiding me everywhere after this incident occurred, and the reason and effect of not replying to my letters.</p>
<p>In his confession, Zhuan Peng listed eleven of his novels. Of course, I don't need to hide it anymore, but for the sake of the truth, I can't let him say it so vaguely. Now I will describe them one by one:</p>
<p>(1) Toothache | It was made by him for Mr. Wang Yixin, because at that time Mr. Wang wanted to start a publication. This manuscript was originally more than 2,000 words long. I added and deleted it twice, increasing it to more than 7,000 words. After Xu Zhimo pointed out some problems, I revised it again, and as a result, only about 6,000 words remained. When revising this article, I used the scenery of Wusong as the background. For example, the evening scene written in the first paragraph is completely my own experience.</p>
<p>(2) A Soldier's Wife | Originally more than 4,000 words long, I increased it to more than 9,000 words. Before revising this article, I had obtained Zhuan Peng's consent. After the Literary Monthly accepted this manuscript, he also knew. At that time, we lived in Shanzhong Road. Zhuan Peng should still remember that it was Mr. Qian Gongxia who lived with us. I think he can also prove it.</p>
<p>(3) The Sixth Birth | As far as I know, the original names are two, one is Cold Night and the other is Life and Death. Last spring, I submitted Zhuan Peng's original manuscript with my name to Dongfang, but it was immediately returned. The editor's reason was... The article was written too hastily, and publishing it would be harmful to me. After a few months, I revised it and showed it to Mr. Chen Fuxi, asking him what title was best. He suggested using The Sixth Birth, and I agreed, but deleted the word "Time". The manuscript was still sent to Dongfang and published in the book.</p>
<p>(4) Fisherman's Joy | Originally named Fishing Boat, Zhuan Peng originally asked Mr. Mu Shiying to take it to Xiandai, but after a long time, it was finally brought back. At that time, I used the scenery of Wujiang as the background and rewrote it three times, adding more than 5,000 words. I think Zhuan Peng should admit it. This article was once submitted to Dongfang Shenbao Monthly and Free Talk, but was not adopted. Later, after a long time, it was published in New China.</p>
<p>(5) Treadmill | Originally named Three People Pumping Water, Zhuan Peng submitted it to Xinyue himself, but it was not used. Later, I revised it twice and changed it to my name and sent it to Xiandai. This manuscript was typed by a certain lady according to my revised manuscript when it was sent to Xiandai. Please ask Mr. Shi Zhicun to prove this. Zhuan Peng told me that this lady could type and was willing to type for me, and he was the one who asked her for me.</p>
<p>(6) Night in the Valley | Originally three to four thousand words long, I revised it and increased it to more than seven thousand words. It was submitted to Xiaoshuo Yuebao but was not accepted, and was later published in Wenyi Yuekan.</p>
<p>(7) Release from Prison | After Zhuan Peng finished writing it, he put it in my drawer for a long time. He and Mr. Fu Shanggao [a good friend who lived with him] both thought it was an unsatisfactory thing. Although there was no time to notify him when revising it, I wrote to him before publishing it.

<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>The passengers on the train were quite crowded. The reason was that the long benches, which could seat three people in a row, were all occupied by those who came first, lying down alone. Therefore, the short benches, which could seat two people in a row, were crowded with people. It was already the second half of the night, and everyone was very tired, leaning their heads against the hard and straight back of the chair, dozing off, sometimes falling down, sometimes tilting left and right, opening their eyes blankly, and closing them drowsily again. This suffering is far greater than that of those who cannot doze off. Most people in the carriage are like this now, and only a few people are sleeping comfortably. This, to a foreigner who doesn't understand the temperament of the Chinese people, I think, he should feel unfair for these many people, or feel the beauty of our Chinese people's humility, right? However, to us, it is not surprising. Now the people squeezed on the short benches, if they had arrived first and saw the long benches empty, would also routinely lie down alone without being polite.</p>
<p>There is only one exception, and that is those hateful waiters. They are waiters, who are supposed to serve the guests, but now they actually occupy two long benches and two short benches. I saw many guests casting angry glances at the two lying waiters.</p>
<p>[Can you let me sleep for a while?] A young man walked over and said very politely.</p>
<p>[Um, um! ...] He replied vaguely. [Talk about it later! I haven't slept for several nights!]</p>
<p>[This guy!] A Western-dressed guest with an eight-character mustache became angry. [This is outrageous! Who gave you the berth? I'll go ask the director later!]</p>
<p>The waiter suddenly woke up, immediately stood up, rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>[I was really confused in my sleep! Were you the gentleman who wanted a berth just now? ... Okay, okay!] He walked away carrying the bedding.</p>
<p>[Hum! ...] The guest smiled smugly, and went to lie down on the chair, quickly starting to snore sweetly.]</p>
<p>I finally dozed off tiredly for a while.</p>
<p>The older generation got off at Nanjing. I lost a companion. Rong doesn't like to talk, this long journey will be terribly lonely. Unintentionally singing the [Little White Rabbit] that Enge often sang, I thought of Enge and his family, and instead felt more depressed.</p>
<p>That great ferry is just ahead, and I long to see it. I don't know what it looks like, I just vaguely remember that the recent president of a certain college mentioned that ferry in a report on production equipment, so its greatness can be imagined. However, I don't know why, the train just stopped on the river bank between the railway station.</p>
<p>A snack vendor suddenly started asking about his bowls and spoons. He had just brought the food onto the train, delivered it to the guests, and got off the train. Now he came up again, and the guests said someone had taken it. Who? The guests were not clear either. It seemed to be a person wearing black clothes and a felt hat, he said. Many waiters were all looking for and questioning him. They thought that only the Yangzhou waiter's appearance was similar to what the guests said. But he denied ever taking the bowl.</p>
<p>[How many pennies can he earn in a day! To take his bowl!] A strong northern waiter said angrily, walking and searching in the carriage.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, he finally found it. It turned out to be hidden behind the luggage rack at the end of the carriage.</p>
<p>[If it wasn't you, who was it! You were standing at this end!] He said sternly.</p>
<p>The Yangzhou man no longer denied it, just silently lowered his head.</p>

<p>["We'll wait here," said Zi Jiu. "I think we should sit together! You don't mind sitting together?"]</p>
<p>While Yina was shaking her head with a smile, Huiqun had already appeared outside the glass door.</p>
<p>["Okay, Miss Song is here!" Zi Jiu cheered.</p>
<p>["You said you were alone," Huiqun said to Yina as she came in, while looking at Song Chen and Zi Jiu.</p>
<p>["You're so late, instead of apologizing, you question people first? And isn't it better to have two more people?"]</p>
<p>["But!"]</p>
<p>["Shouldn't deceive you? Alright, child, just be deceived this once," Yina said, taking Huiqun's hand and walking her inside.</p>
<p>["But we're not allowed to dance today," Huiqun said, after settling down.</p>
<p>["As revenge for being deceived?" Yina asked with a smile. "I completely agree," she said, smiling as she looked at Zi Jiu, because she knew he wouldn't agree.</p>
<p>["Good Miss," Zi Jiu said, "don't get angry like that; we didn't make an appointment, we just bumped into each other at the door."</p>
<p>Huiqun glared at Yina.</p>
<p>Yina just smiled.</p>
<p>["I wonder if Zhichu has come," Zi Jiu said; at the same time, he stood up and took a stroll.</p>
<p>["Didn't see him," Zi Jiu said, returning; "Did you see him dancing?"]</p>
<p>["No," Song Chen replied; then he turned to Yina and said, "I heard from Ye Zhichu that you're writing a long novel for the Literary Weekly?"]</p>
<p>["A novella," Yina said.</p>
<p>["How many words? Is it finished yet?"] Zi Jiu asked.</p>
<p>["About forty to fifty thousand words; haven't started yet."]</p>
<p>Mentioning that novel brought up Yina's worries, and since Ye Zhichu wasn't there, there was an unspeakable desolation stirring beneath her laughter.</p>
<p>["I shouldn't have come here," she regretted privately.</p>

<h3 id="e304">So This Is What Civilized People Are Like <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>European and American countries constantly accuse us Chinese of being barbaric, while boasting of being civilized. While this is enough to serve as a motto for us Chinese to be vigilant and strive for self-improvement, what we see of so-called civilized people here in Shanghai doesn't necessarily qualify as civilized. If you don't believe me, please look at the news reports about people forcibly taking seats on buses and American women slapping students' faces, only to later claim injury and sue in court, which is just one example.</p>
<p>Giving up seats on streetcars and buses is considered a noble virtue among so-called civilized Europeans and Americans. Every gentleman practices it with humility and courtesy, and it's even more imperative to give up seats to ladies. In the eyes of us Chinese, this is indeed what Confucius meant by [it is unnecessary to dwell on such matters]; however, since the influx of European customs, our Chinese gentlemen of all ages have already [learned and practiced it, which is delightful] on streetcars and buses. Unexpectedly, [learning and practicing it] requires [Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application], and incorporating our Chinese national concepts. Therefore, the civilized Europeans and Americans don't quite approve of it. The reason they don't approve, of course, is [you Chinese are a barbaric and lowly race, meant to be servants of Europeans and Americans, so you should give up your seats to civilized Europeans and Americans, and you shouldn't even be allowed to sit with you Chinese. As for us civilized Europeans and Americans giving up our seats to you Chinese, don't even dream about it.] But that day, a certain Chinese student insisted on standing up straight and trying to reason with them, which was naturally his own fault and deserved the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Europeans and Americans boast of being civilized, and our Chinese elites often compare their fellow countrymen to the civilization of Europeans and Americans. However, based on the records in this news report, we should further recognize that the civilization of Europeans and Americans is for Europeans and Americans themselves. We Chinese are not entitled to civilized treatment and should receive the same inferior treatment as the natives of the Americas and Africa.</p>
<p>The court has already accepted the case, and I suppose we'll find out what happens next in the next installment; let's wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Reflections on the Restoration of the Oriental Library <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Zhi</p>
<p>Modern civilization is said to have reached its peak, but what it shows us everywhere is not very [civilized]. To put it bluntly, it is simply the most barbaric of barbarism. Take the January 28th Incident in Shanghai as an example. What the enemy wanted was nothing more than rights and land. They only needed to aim and fire their guns at targets that could hinder them from achieving their goals. Why did they have to bomb our Oriental Library, which had nothing to do with the war, into ashes? Was it a mistake? No, they deliberately wanted to destroy it, because destroying it was tantamount to destroying our culture, or at least inflicting a massive blow on our culture. This heinous act of violence is the civilization presented to us by ambitious imperialists!</p>
<p>The Oriental Library was one of the most significant cultural collections in East Asia. During the January 28th Incident, it was completely destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. This was not only a loss for our country but also a tremendous disaster in the history of world culture!</p>
<p>Our country, which has always prided itself on possessing a four-thousand-year-old culture, may have been a source of glory in the past, but in today's twenty-first century, we see nothing but backwardness in everything. We do not hate the old culture, but we only feel that the times have changed, and the old culture is no longer suitable for present needs. Therefore, if we want to move forward with the times, we should absorb the new culture as much as possible.</p>
<p>The [May Fourth Movement] is said to be the Chinese Renaissance. The new culture at that time showed a vigorous trend. However, due to insufficient material and talent, various cultural undertakings could not be carried out one by one, and the new cultural movement has not yet been fully popularized. In terms of libraries, the most important cultural institutions, there are very few public libraries throughout the country, apart from those attached to major middle schools, and they are all small in scale and poorly equipped. This is still referring to large cities. In small towns, let alone libraries, I'm afraid some don't even have reading rooms! In a country with such a poor cultural infrastructure, it is simply wishful thinking to hope that its culture can be widely disseminated! Fortunately, Shanghai, the cultural hub of the country, established a magnificent and well-equipped Oriental Library in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The people of the country congratulated each other, thinking that our country's old and new cultures would surely be promoted by this, and that the future of culture might receive a ray of light because of this. Who would have thought that it would turn into a scorched earth under the enemy's rain of bullets! Thus, the vast collections of Chinese and foreign books that had been painstakingly collected for thirty years were completely destroyed! In terms of material loss alone, it is at least over a million gold. The huge wound the enemy has inflicted on us truly makes us unable to forget it even in our sleep!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I heard that cultural circles at home and abroad, in view of the destruction of the library, which has had a great and profound impact on social culture and academics, are actively carrying out its restoration, organizing the Oriental Library Restoration Committee, and establishing support committees in Germany, the United States, Britain, and France. It has also established fundraising agencies in seven major cultural centers such as Peiping and Nanking, and hired well-known domestic scholars and international academics as members, with the aim of restoring the old appearance. What a gratifying piece of news! Our restoration of the Oriental Library is not just to seek a new light for China's cultural undertakings; we still have a more significant meaning, that is, on the one hand, to prevent the enemy from ridiculing our country for being unable to recover from a setback; on the other hand, to imply that our nation still has a bit of perseverance and has not given up hope of recovering lost land. We deeply hope that those who care about the country's culture will come forward to enthusiastically provide assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e306">Reasonable Wage Reduction <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Our XX Silk Weaving Factory can be said to be the largest silk weaving factory in China. Recently, our four thousand workers, unable to bear the factory's repeated wage reductions, went on a full strike on March XX, as I'm sure you know!</p>
<p>This strike is purely based on reasonable demands, because the factory's wage reduction this time is too ruthless, simply wanting to immediately murder our four thousand workers and the lives of their parents, wives, and children! This wage reduction by the factory is already the second or third time. Let's not worry about the past. There was already one reduction last August; after only three or four months, now they announce that wages will be reduced to 70% again. The factory's reason for reducing wages is that the silk market sales are stagnant and the wage burden is too heavy. They call the original wage, which maintained the workers' lives, an unreasonable wage, and further reducing it is considered reasonable. Sir, you can understand that such deceptive words are understood from the facts. First, the factory says sales are down, but according to the manager's announcement to the workers, the total turnover in 1933 was more than 6,020,000 yuan, which has exceeded the records of previous years. Is this really a stagnation in sales! Moreover, in previous years, only two branches specializing in plain fabric weaving had night shifts, but now even the branches weaving patterned fabric also have night shifts. Also, according to a factory employee, soon, all of the XX factories will have to add night shifts. If sales are stagnant, the factory should reduce production. Why would they continue to increase production like this? As for wages, according to the company's announcement, out of the total turnover of 6,020,000 yuan in 1933, the expenditure on salaries and wages was 1,050,000 yuan, accounting for 18% of the total turnover. But in reality, the workers don't get that much; even assuming that the 1,050,000 yuan is entirely the workers' wages, the average annual income of the four thousand workers is only 260 yuan, equivalent to 20 yuan per month. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is very high, can this be considered a lot? Moreover, out of this 1,050,000 yuan, the salaries of the staff, ranging from tens to two or three hundred yuan per month, must also be deducted. So how much do the workers actually get! Also, as the workers' skills improve and output increases greatly, their wages should be slightly increased. This is reasonable for the workers; moreover, the increased production due to the workers' improved skills is beneficial to the factory. Now, they are actually reducing wages because of this, which is truly unreasonable.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Furthermore, as machinery becomes increasingly complex, the workers' weaving becomes increasingly difficult. For example, with Hua Silk Georgette, it used to be eighty picks per inch, but now it has to be increased to ninety-six picks per inch; it used to be a single shuttle box, but now they use double shuttle boxes and four shuttle boxes; they used to use single shafts, but now they use double shafts and triple shafts. As such, it is now three or four times more difficult for workers to manage the machinery than before. Workers who used to be able to weave one piece a day can now weave less than one piece, and their wages are less than before. But the factory can increase the selling price because the current products are of better quality, and the wages remain the same, which is actually more profitable than before. Thus, the original wage standard is already an extremely unreasonable standard for the workers. However, the factory is ruthless and not only doesn't increase the original wage but also wants to eliminate it. Isn't this taking the workers' lives! In addition, if workers accidentally damage anything 丨丨 broken ends, oil stains, small flaws, they have to pay compensation; during the renovation period, they are laid off for half a month or a month, and the workers get no wages. As such, the wages workers receive are actually extremely unreasonable.</p>
<p>We will announce other detailed situations in our factory and the suffering of the workers later. In short, in order to live, we work hard every day and exchange our blood and sweat for wages, but according to the newly revised wage standard, our workers really have no way to maintain their lives, so we have to strike and demand that the factory cancel the unreasonable new wage standard.</p>
<p>Right and wrong, truth, will have a public opinion in society. We hope that people from all walks of life and the working masses will give us righteous support!</p>
<p>Sincerely!</p>
<p>XX Factory worker Yao Yunxian, March 14th</p>
<p>The tenth day after the strike</p>
<p>Editor's note: Labor disputes are a major social problem since the development of capitalism. Since then, various people have expressed their solutions from their own perspectives, but although there are many discussions and many solutions, this problem has not yet been resolved, and the disputes are increasingly expanding. Therefore, the editor is unwilling to say more about this problem, fearing that it will only increase theoretical disputes and will not help the actual situation. However, although this problem is large, it is not an unsolvable problem. Although the causes of this problem are extremely complex and related to the social system, it is not without traces. Therefore, although the editor is unwilling to express personal opinions on this issue, based on objective facts, 丨丨 refers to Yao Jun's letter, exploring the characteristics of labor disputes at this stage, although it will not help the efforts of the working masses, it seems to be no more than superfluous words, or it can provide the information to those who care about the problem and are prepared to solve it.</p>
<p>The cause of this strike in Yao Jun's factory was the factory's unwarranted wage reduction. According to Yao Jun, the wage reduction was definitely not due to stagnant sales, and the total turnover was cited as proof. This is certainly true, but it is not known that the factory's move also has its own objective environment. In recent years, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the narrow market for industrial products are known to everyone. The dumping of foreign goods and the difficulty of competition in national industries are known to everyone. The sluggishness of finance and the concentration of investment in public bonds are also known to everyone. Generally speaking, the decline of national industries and the implementation of austerity policies are inevitable results, not the factory's too ruthless heart. The fact that Yao Jun's factory is developing is a fact, but it is also a temporary fortune, a special exception. Although it is difficult to predict its future, it can be said that it cannot always be so smooth and continue to develop. In view of the general economic depression and the uncertainty of the future of business, the factory took this opportunity to try to reduce costs in order to take risks and make a fortune in one fell swoop, which is also human nature. If the market conditions improve in the future, it can continue to move forward according to the normal rules, even if the economic crisis deepens, it will not compensate too much. Therefore, the factory's wage reduction this time was not without reason.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the competition in the employment field, the factory is more likely to reduce wages. The economic situation in the cities has indeed declined significantly, and the number of unemployed people is increasing every day. At the same time, due to the bankruptcy of rural areas, farmers in the interior are leaving their homes and gathering in cities to seek employment. Therefore, the factory has the confidence to reduce wages. The reason why the factory could not reduce wages in the past, or even increase them, was definitely not for the sake of the difficult life of the working masses, and it was not out of pity. The reason for this is that economic development reduces the number of unemployed people and increases the number of workers needed. If the workers unite and strike, it is difficult to recruit so many people to replace them at one time. Now it is different. The workers can strike, but the factory can recruit the same number of people in a matter of days, whether they are skilled or unskilled, which is a matter of raising their hands.</p>
<p>In short, the generation of labor disputes is not due to the labor's unreasonable troubles, nor is it due to the capital's excessive ruthlessness. They are all due to the impossible situation and are controlled by the social environment. Therefore, the disputes in labor issues are actually a reflection of the defects of the entire social system. The resolution of this type of problem is the resolution of social problems, which is also clearly obvious.</p>

<p>This depicts a story of the oppression of ordinary people in the early imperial era. At that time, there were many common people in Huzhou, Zhejiang, who made a living by fishing. The Xiao En and his daughter Guiying, who are depicted in this picture fishing in the wind and waves, are part of those fishermen. Xiao En and his daughter fish in the wind and waves all day long, and they feel very tired when they go home. Because the wind and waves have been very strong for several days, they get very little fish, and they have run out of rice at home; they feel even more depressed.

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Because of the appearance of this person Li Jian, my cousin left without saying goodbye. By the time I knew the news of their secret marriage, they had already gone to Nanjing for their honeymoon. I also rushed to Nanjing like a neurotic, but in the end I couldn't find their traces. (Thinking about it now, if I had found them at the time, what would I have done!) Just then, Zhilin appeared in front of me. She was a classmate of Sister Wen, and we met through Sister Wen's introduction. Speaking of it, I got rid of a Yuan Wen and gained a Zhilin without any effort. In any case, it was worth doing. Moreover, many of my friends were urging the realization of this matter from the side. Naturally, they were all well-intentioned. As for Zhilin, she wasn't necessarily a woman who couldn't inspire love. [Since the other party in our men's love is a woman, Yuan Wen is a woman, and Zhilin is also a woman, can't you love Zhilin just because you're in love with Yuan Wen?] I was once questioned by a friend, but I couldn't say a reason. I regarded such a lovely woman as Zhilin as if I didn't see her. And I listened to my good friend's explanation: [You love Yuan Wen, and Yuan Wen leaves you, and you feel the pain of being lovelorn; similarly, Zhilin loves you, and you don't accept her love, and she feels the same pain of being lovelorn. You should think of others when you think of yourself, and you should combine in every way.]</p>
<p>This again has to say that I am a person who is good at creating troubles for myself. I didn't accept their advice, and I declared that whoever mentioned Yuan Wen and Zhilin again, I would break off friendship with them. Of course, these were angry words; however, it was a fact that I didn't want to hear their names again.</p>
<p>Now, Yuan Wen and I met in a chance place. The man she would rather give up a man who loved her and marry is married to another woman. We were both silent, watching the smoke rings in front of each of us rise up and gradually turn into nothing. The sound of rain outside the window beat on the glass like music, without stopping.</p>
<p>[Yingdi, why don't you talk!] My cousin forced a smile. [Do you think it's an amazing story?]</p>
<p>I shook my head with a smile. [Not really. There are many stories like this!]</p>
<p>Only then did she really smile, and she understood what I meant. [Okay, Yingdi, let's not talk about the past.] Saying this, she picked up a cigarette from the cigarette case.</p>
<p>[Your smoking skills are amazing! Did you learn them recently?]</p>
<p>[Not really, just puffing when I have nothing to do.] She leisurely smoked again. 0</p>
<p>[I'm the same. Sometimes a can of cigarettes sits there for a whole week, and sometimes it's finished in one or two days.]</p>
<p>Like __________ talking to her about these irrelevant topics, I seemed to want to laugh. How clever humans are, easily敷衍ing over a serious situation. My cousin seemed to understand that although she was telling me the story as if it were a joke, it was somewhat reluctant. Smoking, forced laughter, were all trying to dilute the image of this question. The two exchanged glances, and then there was a sudden silence.</p>
