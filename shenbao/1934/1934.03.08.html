<p>我國北部近來的最大毒害不一定是帝國主義者也不一定是土匪和豪紳汚吏而是由農村經濟衰退而來的一般生活的頽廢跟隨着這種頽廢而發生的紅丸與白麵的毒害我們據普通的情况以觀察社會找不到紅丸白麵的好處在那裏就是吸紅丸白麵的人也以爲這是很毒害的然則他們爲什麽一定要吸爲什麽明知是毒害而甘心採取這種慢性的自殺政策呢</p>
<p>吾以爲最大原因是農村經濟瀕於破産的畸形現象黄河流域以北的各省區農民生活更覺困苦卽是豐收的年成一般農民也不能以他們的勞力換取他們最低限度的生活必需品因此在北部農村中發現兩種現象一種</p>
<p>是農民生活的營養不足體力也就隨着營養不足而漸次衰退北部農民雖說遺傳的骨格比較粗壯士質比較厚重但是現在一般農人大多數面帶飢色表現着營養不足的樣子於是工作能率自然隨之减退而在社會的需要方面却是要他獻出所有全部能力於是他們就自然而然的去尋求一種足以激剌的興奮劑再有一種北部農村經濟已演成全無生氣的形態一般人必需的生活尙且不能支持其他一切娱樂當然完全没有了可是一般人總是需要娱樂正當有益的娱樂旣不可得則祇有去尋求一刹那間的剌激把這種剌激當作快樂了且吸紅丸白麵比較吸鴉片更爲省事因此普遍的蔓延就起來了</p>
<p>這種情形在前幾年還祇限於一部人和一部分的地區其爲毒害縱很劇烈但還不甚大如能盡力取締加以法律裁制尙不難消滅牠然而現在這種毒物北部各省區散佈得非常之廣卽一般城市的勞工也有不少的傳染近來且收北而南長江流域的下層羣衆也同受着傳染了不料紅丸白麵的毒害竟成了中國整個的大問題</p>
<p>帝國主義的侵略我們還可以喚起羣衆爲民族的鬭爭土匪和豪绅汚吏祇要能認眞整頓政治就可以肅清惟有紅丸白麵的毒定上了癮後就越毒越深一個好人竟變成廢人一羣好人也變成一羣廢人因爲凡人總需要有健强的體格纔能負重荷擔大事如果體格壞了無論大小事都將無法進行况且這種毒害遺傳下去不僅眼前經濟陷於困境將來恐不免於破産甚且使後代的人同受痛苦這是與人種的興衰民族的存亡有嚴重的關係所以我們對於這事不可輕輕放過</p>
<p>就消極方面論勸人戒除嚴厲禁止其販賣是唯一的急要辦法但是都曾試騐過或正在嚴厲推行其效力究竟何如我們看山西的情形就能充分明白了換一句話說在目前世界不景氣情况之下要人不爲非要人守法知恥要人不圖僥倖賺錢可能性是很少的所以從消極方面加以制裁外更應該輔以積極方面的辦法</p>
<p>我們以爲積極的辦法非但要禁止毒物的買賣而且要根本使人不吸使人不吸的方法自然不是容易也不是短時期内就可以見效因爲社會的制裁力丨卽公共的道德公共的是非批判丨不是短時期可以養成敎育的培殖知識的修養都需得要有相當的時間其尤重要的還是在經濟基礎的穩定苟能在農村中提高一般人的生活水凖重建瀕於頽廢的農村經濟農人知活能向上發展然後進而提倡公共正當與合理的娱樂則這種刺激作用僅止一時的毒物就會自然消滅的</p>

<p>（倫敦）　英日談判歷三十分鐘後改作私人討論、後復開會、但未能妥恊、旋即散會、後發表一文、内稱、會議對於討論範圍問題、已臻絶境、此乃英日代表俱引爲憾事者、惟鑒於此問題之嚴重、故議定延會至明日云、</p>
<p>（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英日棉織業談判失敗形勢現已證實、惟雙方皆欲以失敗責任諉諸他方、故本日兩國代表集會時或尙不致公然宣告决裂、目前之問題則爲談判失敗後、英國政府是否將立卽採行報復手段、據一般人意見、</p>
<p>英帝國　屬地若完全禁止日本貨物進口、則國内物價勢必騰貴、此非英國政府所樂爲、故完全禁止日貨進口必難辦到、英國政將設法聯絡西方國家之同受日貨競爭影響者、俾互相團結以資保護、關於此層、聞英國已與荷蘭進行談判矣、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晨英日組織業代表之會議、確成僵局、但因事關重要、故延會至明日、聞此延會乃蘭開夏代表與英政府間接洽之結果、查此僵局乃因討論範圍應否包括世界商塲抑僅以英國及其殖民地市塲爲限之問題而起、如談判完全破裂、則保護英人商塲制止日人競爭之要求必較前更趨激昻、而此問題或將由外交方面辦理之、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　七日英日人民代表會商空氣頗險惡、日代表態度强硬、不辭會議决裂、外務省方面因希望會商成立、故已命駐英大使松平與日代表團聯絡凖備打開危機、據日本方面觀察、日英會商决裂之結果、英國孟却斯德綿業者將必主張、（一）廢巡英日通商條約、（二）排斥所有日本製貨、（三）與英本國有經濟關係之任何第三國一致參加戰綫、實行排日貨運動、而從前慰撫反日運動之英國政府亦必出於非常手段日本政府因感此種事件之發生爲不幸之事、擬由兩國政府解决交涉、現已進行凖備中、松平大使與英商相蘭西曼之善後談判、不久卽可實現、亦未可知也、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　出席日英會商之蘭加西亞方面之代表於六日深夜抵倫敦、並謂倘在最後之演臺上、日本方面態度未發生急變、則七日之本會議難免决裂、並聞當此不可避免之局面、而蘭加西亞之代表等人早已關於將來之對策詳細考究、其意見大致如下、日英會商之决裂甚爲遺憾、但假令决裂以後、而英國綿業之地位依舊鞏固、蓋英國之進口總量占有全世界之一成五分、其出口僅占六分而已、且今後英國倘與各國訂立此種通商協定、則比較日本當屬極有利益、因此七日之會商、若竟至决裂、則英國及其直轄殖民地當採用雙重之進口折扣制、以爲繼護云、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日英棉業會商、因雙方意見對立無法挽回、恐將於本日之會商、卽行决裂、日本外務當局正考究今後之後之檏策、外務當局以日英會商、如果决裂、認爲須留餘地、使交涉將來有繼續之可能、松平駐英大使亦盡力此點、但英國方面、於會商開始前、曾向英國政府陳情、一日會内决裂、請提高日貨關稅及廢棄日英通商條約等、日政府有鑑於此、認爲交涉如果决裂、英國政府、必考慮採何等之措置、日本政府方面如英國有將該問題移歸政府交涉之意、日本亦擬允諾、此時則不限於棉業關係、將進一步、立於日英通商全般之大局、草成具體之某調、整日英通商之全部、從事折衝、（七日電通電）</p>

丘探梅歸來，是多麽的雅人深致呢！　　男女的青年，借這地方，作爲密談的塲合，并且在千人石上，留了雙雙倩影，表示來看梅花而留紀念的但是我看見了時代姑娘們，着了二寸多高的高跟皮鞋的向千人石上兜圈子，我時常爲伊們有些担心，不過在伊的旁邊，却總有一根活手杖，很留心的保駕呢！探梅的結果，折去了不少梅花，留了地上不少的出珠的合浦　乃令  　　一提起「合浦」這地方的名字，我們便會聯想到「珠還合浦」這句子。本來在中國的分省地圖上，我們儘可以在廣東省的西南隅那裏，旁近大海的角落上找見寫着「合浦」這兩個字的地方、但是這兩個字是太小了，太隱藏在人家不注意的小角落上了，所以没有人去關心它；不過，倘若是一想到「珠還合浦」這句子時，人們便又會在腦根裏幻想起一個美麗的所在，有海，有魚，有貝類，有珠的好地方了。　　是的，在從前合浦的確是一個這樣美麗的，値得人留戀的好地方。但是時至今日，已經是「今與昔非」了；不過究竟變成了什麽樣哩？因是，我覺得有把我這次回鄉（合浦）的所見，書告「春秋」讀者之必要。　　我們如果從水路上去合浦，有行駛於廣州香港海口北海海防的輪船。海口是海南島北邊的重要商鎭，北海哩，却就是合浦縣屬的一個出口，合浦一切的出産，都是經由北海，再運送到外地方去的，所以專門擔任運送流通的一九八牙行」，便多誤於北海的幾條唯一的馬路上。海防就是安南的一個要埠。　　從前廣西的貨物，没有梧州可以轉由西江運入廣州，多是從河道運至合浦，再由合浦運至北海。現在可不同了，一條「總江」幾乎成爲了寂寞的，有詩趣的河道，絶無船隻之喧呶！大概也是天數吧，接着這出珠聞名於全國的合浦，珠的出産也變爲鮮少了！　　珠的出産旣然短少了，但是與「珠」同音的猪一却一年一年出得更多；甲一上靠「猪」的買賣來謀生的合浦縣人還很多很多；不過最近爲了受大連猪的打擊，香港的猪價狂跌了，藉此生活的人也仍是呌苦連天！　　除了「珠」與「猪」之外，合浦目前也還有極爲聞名的「沙蠶」「安春」「燕窩」等物出産。談到這三種東西，却也是令人羨慕不已的。爲什麽原故哩？因爲都可說是自生自來的，母須費人們較多的力量而得到的物事。　　「沙蠶」是一種生在沙灘上的，狀似蠶形的沙蟲，所以也有人呌做「沙蟲」。據說潮水一退的時候，從沙灘上便出現了很多很多的這東西，一舉手曞便可以得到很多。沙蠶的食法，就是拿來晒乾，炒掉了沙，或油炸，或煮湯，都是一樣的甜美可口，在合浦北海這算不得貴重的東西，但是出了合浦，據說人們是極其珍重的看待它的。　　「安春」是一種像鷓鴣一樣的飛鳥，在合浦左近的一個孤獨的小丘上，到了夏秋之間，便有成羣結隊的「安春」從他處飛來，相傳是「安春」飛到這小丘，照例要在這兒歇息歇息的，許多年來都是如此，從没有間斷過。而且「安春」有一個特性，就是見有燈火，它便羣相撲近，所以捉「安春」的人，只消一張網，在夜晚的時候張在這小丘上，旁邊點一盞燈，明天便滿網都是「安春」了，因爲「安春」多，於是價錢便極賤，一時賣不掉的都晒成了「安春」脯，運到外地去。　　「燕窩」是燕鳥所吐出來的東西。在合浦附近也就有一個小島，是燕鳥常常到那兒來吐「燕」的地方；只要一條船把燕運了回來，用人工揀掉了黏在上面的微毛，便可以出賣了。　　出珠的名地，現在珠是鮮少了，一天一天的鮮少了，雖還有其他的産物，但是居民的生活也還是每况愈下的，日見貧困。在人們的心眼中是一個美麗的，有詩趣的地方，究竟也還是跟其他的破落的農村與市鎭一樣的凄凉破碎！</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊貢獻話婦女節與國貨  仰葊　　今日爲國際婦女節，在婦女國貨年中，過這富有意義的婦女節，尤其覺得有紀念的價値。昨日中華國貨産銷合作恊會，旣在大陸商塲梵王渡俱樂部招待婦女界領袖，舉行盛大之集會。今日婦女國貨年運動委員會，更在湖社舉行婦女節聯歡大會，同時中國國貨公司上海國貨公司等聯合舉行婦女節大廉價。社會人士與國貨界領袖熱心於婦女服用國貨之事業，爲婦女國貨年頭，確可欣幸確可歡慰的現象。近數月來，抵貨運動，久已消沈，而日貨進口，勢如潮湧，最近一星期中，大批日貨，不斷的來華傾銷，由日輪阿蘇丸六用丸等運來的布疋，水泥，五金，電料，東糖，魚介，火柴梗，文具等，竟達十萬件以上。運到後，大都在本埠倉庫起卸，少數則運往長江各埠，日商目的，在於操縱我國市塲，批售價格極廉，而佣金十分優厚，本市一般貪利奸商，喪心病狂，竭力爲之推銷，每次貨到卽罄，幾有求過於供之勢。本日有三萬餘件，由大阪運來。一方更儘量擴充紗業，圖握紡織工業之霸權，一方廣設大規模之百貨商店。如吳淞路的實業百貨店株式會社，與模仿國産傾銷機關的支那物産館，及兆福商店，尤爲傾銷日貨之大本營。我人在這婦女紀念節中，目擊日貨猖獗情形，令人不寒而慄。强顔爲歡，於心滋苦。我希望婦女界經此盛會以後，痛外貨之傾銷，憫國産之困頓，各宜抱着决心，持以毅力，人人加入婦女服用國貨會，以服用國貨爲天職，統制家庭用品，執定非國貨不買之宗旨。嚴厲監督男子，積極敎導兒童。雖一紙一筆一火柴一洋針，絶對當用國貨，絲毫不可通融。國家至於如此，國貨的市場，被人侵略如此，我婦女界苟有血氣，苟具良心，當然一致贊助這種舉動，身體力行，來自救救國。國際婦女節感言  孟昭　　今天是國際婦女節，顧名思義！也就是尊重世界勞働女子，含有褒揚的一個令節！　　大家都知道美國女子是浪漫的！法國女子是奢華的！俄，德，女子是勤儉的！而日本女子，却有勤儉，服從，愛國，的三種美德！我們中國女子是怎樣呢？儘管是婦女國貨年，脂粉香進口，會有驚人統計的數字！浪漫過美國女子，奢華過法國千金！一日不做，一日不飽的女工，我也見到有不少的學起樣來！現在銀價提高！來路貨强，她們逼着你父親，或丈夫汗血得來的金錢，揮霍格外慷慨！那女工肚皮雖然丢在背上，摩而登之，時髦不可不學，還說什麽？逢到這個國際婦女節，美，法，等邦，她們衣，食，住，行，都是用自己本國的出品！惟獨中國婦女，喜歡人家的寳貝？厭惡自己的東西！這樣：國際婦女節在中國，是根本談不到的啊！　　可是話還要得說回來！我希望中國女子，趕緊轉變作風！努力自己的品格！做些抵制外貨的成績出來！勿辜負這個苦心提倡的「婦女國貨年」纔好！羅斯福白銀政策與我國國貨業之前途  盧荻　　當今經濟戰爭激烈之際，弱肉强食，劣敗優勝，蓋理所必然。彼美國旣執世界金融之牛耳，自能恣意擺佈金融力薄弱之諸國，一如造化小兒之愚弄吾輩蚩蚩之氓然。羅斯福之貨幣政策，係一貫的系統的，首爲禁金输出，繼而收買國内礦産黄金，復進而在國際市塲上購買黄金，最近更以實施與我國有莫大關係之白銀政策聞矣。此等設施之目的惟何？膨脹通貨而已。　　一言以蔽之，羅期福之貨幣政策，噬人自肥政策而已。數月來法國兩度謠傳放棄金本位，與乎荷蘭，瑞士，意大利等國之大形恐慌，豈非沙姆大叔之賜乎？時到今日，禍咎臨吾國矣，慘毒之白銀政策見諸實施矣。嗚呼！吾國年來國民經濟，賴國民共同努力，尙幸差强人意，未至全部崩潰。羅斯福之白銀政策，無異旱天霹靂，預言吾國經濟前途日趨窮蹙破産也。　　溯乎近數年間，銀價慘跌，各國對華輸入貿易俱大形不振。關册載述昭然，吾人母庸多引數年，徒占篇幅。有輩經濟學者，以爲金貴銀賤，我國購買力亦減低，無何種利益可言。殊不知所謂購買力，實有對内的購買力與對外的購買力之别，未可混爲一談。銀價低落，國民對外購買力雖减，而對内購買力則增。吾國近年農村破産，外國經濟恐慌餘波所及，無異雙斧伐樹，而國貨業尙能蒸蒸日上，國民經濟發達因是以賴，豈徒然哉！國人徒知歐戰時國貨業之飛黄騰達，不知銀價跌落中，吾國國貨業亦藉此千載良機，向上發展。事實固若斯，毋庸吾人喋喋也。　　然泰極否來，盛衰交替，霹靂一聲，美國竟以提高銀價聞。苟其計行，則金銀間比價與前異，而金賤銀貴（與現狀相對而言）之現象伴之而生。昔日之良機，今不可再矣。何則？銀價漲則我對外購買力隨之而漲，對國貨問津者少，外貨得源源輸入，此揆諸學理事實，未或爽者也。今吾國備受日俄二國傾銷，國貨銷塲已大見阻滯。苟羅斯福白銀政策行，則在斯貶幣倾銷（ＥxchangeDumping），美貨輸華必驟增，我國貨業添一勁敵，其則陷於困境，實可預言。　　國貨業之發展，固以農村繁榮，政治安定爲前提，然實施種種限制政策，以阻止外貨之輸銷，亦不可缺。如保護關稅，各統制貿易，如匯兌管理均是。今日本自昭和六年再度禁金輸出，减低平價後，貨物輸華，大有起色。美國近亦减低美元平價，且更進而提高銀價，是誠再接再厲之策。俄國貨物之生産，因無利潤之企圖，而以最新式工業行之，成本较任何國爲低。此三大强鄰，虎視耽耽，莫不欲掠得我國市塲以爲其過剩商品之尾閭。然在吾國自身，則保護手段，蕩然無存，金融匯兌大權悉操諸外人手中。若是赤手空拳，何以應敵抗戰？嗚呼，國貨業在此風雨飄搖之中，苟吾細民尙不洞悉事理，昧於小利，購買外貨，則國貨業壽命不永矣。使吾細民係有熱血愛國者，發誓終身服用國貨，則國貨業丨吾國國民經濟之基礎丨庶有豸乎！名媛提倡國貨犧牲色相  孫籌成　　丨婦女國貨年之佳話丨　　上海國貨工廠聯合會常務委員馬濟生申夢世等，爲提倡國貨，使國人購買國貨者有認識國貨之機會，而免被人以魚目混珠之假國貨所欺騙，故在蘇州最熱鬧之觀前街上租定鉅大房屋，開設中國國貨大市塲，邀集蘇滬杭三處著名國貨廠商前往參加，每業限定一家，不得兼售異類出品，以免與他業品類有所抵觸，開幕以來，業已數月，營業興盛，足徵三吳人士均愛用國貨，舊歷新年，爲增加顧客興趣起見，邀請滬上男女話劇家三十餘人，前往表演話劇，因黄瑞珍女士，對於提倡國貨，亦甚熱心，特懇其前往客串數天，黄女士畢業女子中學，性好吟詠，且擅交際，曾以白玉名義試上銀幕，成績頗佳，客臘在聖愛娜以青娥四小姐之名，舉行交際舞，名滿申江，詳細情形，已見當時新聞夜報與晶報等，毋庸多贅，此次因情不可却，偕馬申諸君聯袂赴吳，以旅館嘈雜，不便寄居，乃借宿予寓，而内子松如等朝夕共話，甚相得，渠喜唱話劇，演赖婚與啼笑因緣等劇，不特表情細膩，并且能將婦女對於提倡國貨之責任，穿插於說白中，而發人猛醒，故特贈以一聯一文，聯嵌其名，曰「鳳乃禽中瑞鳥，」「儒爲席上珍琦，」文叙其事，曰「瑞珍女士，畢業高中，善於交際，同儕推崇，多才多藝，能舞能歌，色如白玉，貌媲青娥，喜唱話劇，擅演賴婚，秋皮一轉，舉座銷魂，提倡國貨，毅然赴蘇，犧牲色相，跋涉長途，觀東客串，轟動全城，表情細膩，莫之與京，」此亦婦女國貨年内之韻事，用特表而出之，以告熱心國貨之同志。怎樣改進國貨？  甘純權　　我國因時勢之需求，新式公司工廠三十餘年來先後組織，氣象蓬勃，大有可觀，惟於改進出品一節，頗覺頭緒萬端，所感困難者，簡言之，一爲人才問題，一爲資本問題，欲人才之集中，與管理之週密，非有大量資本不可，今我國農工商業之組織，在五百萬元以上資本者，巳屬不多，每因經濟之周轉不靈，而影響於出品之優劣，及營業之盛衰，再者當今英日兩國在華投資之數甚鉅，其潛勢力至爲雄厚，兼之外人有在華設廠之權，如此内外交迫，更使華商不易發展，今爲根本之圖，則人才問題尤在資本問題之先，茲述管見如下。　　（一）聘用專門人才，精密研究出品運銷各地之市塲中實際情形，以及顧客最近之需要如何，而作改進其出品之依據。　　（二）聘用專門人才，充分研究運輸問題取運輸之捷徑，化最少之運費，使其出品成本減輕。　　（三）聘用專門人才　詳細研究製造品及原料之供給，如何適合消費者所需物品之時間，以免過與不及之弊。　　（四）聘用專門人才，採取調查統計方法，研究市價之漲落，避免貨價中途降落之損失。　　（五）聘用專門人才，研究公司工廠如何與銀行或合作社聯絡，以調劑經濟之周轉。　　（六）聘用專門人才，嚴訂貨物標準價格，以便供求雙方交易，而免爭執。</p>

<p>自由談	缺陷  莊閑　　歷史上有許多故事，很幽美，有趣，但多半是未曾完成的。看去未曾完成，而其實是完成了，其意義要超過多餘底曼衍。當日「天傾西北，地陷東南」，所以有女媧鍊石，鍊石而補之，則天地也還是不完全的。　　王國維先生曾在某詞話中，講過臉相上的裝扮，點一顆痣要增加許多美觀，而這還是一種大本領，因爲點的不適合是要更糟的。在文學上更不必說「講了一半的故事」其味雋永的多，「缺陷的美」遠超過完滿的美，而其實本身是完美的。　　這是一點點藝術風采，使人生的意義加高了許多。人世事大率荒唐，迂廻曲折，且偶然之中而預偶然，苦痛之中更有苦痛。母論看去像神仙，逍遙自在其實許是有苦說不出。所能自慰者，要在這廻曲中領略到一點風姿韻致，聊以自解。　　讀過歷史的當知道許多人，如神龍見首不見尾，來也如甚風疾雨，其去也雲靄怡怡，如范蠡，如魯連，不但功成身退，所以避禍而全生，大概未作事之先也没有很大成功的奢望。倘若范蠡一定長久做官，魯連一定受千金之壽，則意義反要减少了。　　人事說做是一定没有完成之日，在適可而止時戞然而止，則餘味正自悠然。陳希夷勸人對優好之所勿久戀，得意之地勿再往，雖是明哲保身的「世故」，却也深懂得藝術的人生。留有餘情，則在記憶中永保持着回味趣致，正如喝酒，爛醉如泥至於滿地打滾，爭如陶然一觴，不醒也不醉呢？　　要凡事皆如自己的意必不可能，處處成功必毫無意味，不如留着一方面的缺憾，也保持着無限心意的和平。持此以例現代許多人的行爲丨丨尤其是西洋人的丨丨例如「竭澤而魚」或「不留餘地」，要使人感到非常腐穢！林風眠的繪畫  活水　　說起林風眠氏的作品，我五年前曾在本埠尙賢堂看到過。那時候，林氏的油畫色調有點兒冷冷的，林氏的國畫很像嶺南的高氏弟兄。這次在杭州藝專的展覽會，他有油畫七點，國畫條幅十點，册頁十點，作風可說全部改變了。一進門那幅大的（題名悲哀）油畫，還有點像五年前的意味，但左首第一間的那六幅，就完全不同了。林氏用綫在五年前還不甚顯著，現在，就是在「悲哀」那幅上，也有極有力同時極鋒利的綫條在縱横着，其餘幾幅也一樣；林氏用刷在五年前還有些柔軟味，現在，所有他的洋畫畫幅上，都一刷有一刷的重量，使人對他的一點一綫都不敢忽視；我說過，以前林氏用色有點兒冷靜，現在，大紅，大黄，深藍，重紫，濃綠，漆黑，幾乎没有一筆的色彩不是熱烈到了極點的！「林風眠變了」我幾乎在那兒呌出來。人家說：居可移氣，養可移體。西湖，我們知道是山明水秀宜於高人逸士居處的地方，照這樣說，林風眠旣嘗居西湖六七年之久，要是變，應該變得柔和優閑一點才對，何以變得更熱烈更雄偉起來了呢？我敢說，那是因爲林風眠本人是眞具有熱血的藝術家，他的熱血像是一車的火，西湖的風景像是一杯的水，車薪杯水是不濟事的！　　然而環境之於個人，到底是不能完全没有影響的，這在他的中國畫上終於給我們看到了。在這些中國畫上，無論造境，構圖，用筆，運墨，都顯然有一種輕靈娟秀之氣，隱隱地撲上觀者的心頭來！那是什末呢？我說，那是西湖！　　在朋友介紹後短短的接談中，林氏談到了工具的問題。依他說，他的油畫之所以同他的國畫完全是兩種趣味的原故，大約因爲是工具的不同罷？但我以爲，這是不然的。我們應當說林氏的身上，原來是有着這一進取一退讓的精神的：時代的意識使他進取，他把這種精神表現出來，那是他的油畫；環境的意味使他退讓，他把好表現了，那是他的國畫。　　質之林氏，以爲然否？割草棚子  宇文宙　　也許是契訶夫更近乎智識份子的氣質吧，我往旆總愛藉他底作品來打發我底一部分寂寞和苦悶的時光。偶爾，不覺又翻到了他底「宴會」。　　宴會中的男主人公，因爲要逃避城市底苦悶，一心想到南方的故鄉中去割草。這，却使我驀地想起了我那故鄉底割草情景，尤其是那别有天地的割草棚子　這種棚子底組織，是專瘦拿來爲那些山多草多的大地主們割草的。裏面有老閭，有工頭，亦有分爲幾等的工人。老閭呌做包頭子，地主們底草山就由他包着雇用一批賤價的勞力者組成棚子來割，雖然并非資本家，但他只要地主很少的代價就將草山包來，是要靠着在割草的人們底身上賺錢的。工頭呌做帶頭匠，正等於工廠裏的「拿摩温」，有時亦可在包頭子那裏分得一點肥。工人底等數很多，前三等呌做大刀把，二刀把，三刀把，大約都是些有了十年左右的割草歷史的青年好漢，其餘的便只由工資底多少來隱隱區别等級了，并没有一定的名字，而這一部分人大約都是由一般不能過冬的貧苦人家出來的子弟，其目的只在求得飯吃，能够一月得着幾角錢的工資到是份外的希望，自然被剥削的程度也就比其他一切都加深了。工作更是很苦的，天還没有亮就得上山，普通總是講的要割了幾十把草才天亮，不管是草上結着繁霜和堅冰都要如此，往往刀割在冰上發響；夜間還要趕摸工，在有月亮的時分簡直休想睡覺，卽使能够睡着亦是不到暖和就又起身了；每天只有三餐菜粥搶着吃，内中的紅苕便是充飢抵餓的乾食，而且并没有多的；手足除了凍裂得像龜紋一樣以外，剌戳刀傷的血口却可以常見。只有一點可以使人感到興味，那就是前呼後應的山歌和行列整齊的草把，然而這正是他們底慘痛的呼聲和悲苦的遺蹟，也許遠非未曾厠身其間的人們所能想像得到的吧。　　在我那遍山皆草的故鄉，割草也是一年之中最主要的一種收獲。一到了冬天，遍山遍野都有人在割草了，各種各樣的山歌就在那山野中蕩來蕩去，各色各式的草把就在那草原上飜着排着，倘若是在草原閃閃發光的日中時分，一個能够路過那裏的人是一定要羡慕那種生活而覺得「宴會」中的男主人公是深得了尋樂之道的。其實，誰又知道在那别人看來　爲是很有興味的生活中。却包藏着無限的辛酸與痛苦！恐慌的時候  穉玉女士　　說是市面冷淡，銷路不好，幾十家繅絲棧都就一下停辦了。當我們聽見這消息的時候，大家都成着了失業的恐慌，像大禍臨頭似的；可是我們終於失業了！而且這一失業就是一個多月。做生活的時候，很少的工錢已經不够養活自己，何况現在是失業了！我們的一雙手閒着，肚子餓着，多麽焦急呵！我們希望着趕快開廠，或者找些别的生活做做。我還好，肚子雖然餓，可是爹跟哥都有着生意，他們多少還分一點給我吊吊命；可是隔壁的大轉子就像發狂了！她常常鬧着，駡着，有時跑到廠門口去問幾時開廠。她的男人雖是在拉黄包車，可是拉一天歇一天，拉來的錢，是不够他們吃飯的，而她的男人還要常常喝酒！有些時候，男人被警察打了，扯去了車子的照會，回家來總是對大轉子發皮氣，駡她只會像母猪一樣坐在家裏等吃。所以大轉子在失業期間，不多笑，眉頭總是皺着，她瘦得多了！　　總算她的運氣好，不久，在離我們家十幾里以外的一家繅絲棧，因爲有一個「推車」的請病假兩天被開除了。我才聽見這消息的時候，大轉子已搶了我的先，補上了。第一天放工回來的時候，她雖然疲倦得氣都喘不過來，可是見了我們，她的嘴角邊是在閃着些微的笑，好像得了勝似的。以前，當她給她的男人打了，哭着要找生活做的時候，我總是安慰她，希望她早一點找着生活。可是她現在比我們先找着了，一看見她的笑紋，不知怎的，我心頭便起着一種嫉妒。　　從這一天起，就不常見她了。據說她現在做的鐘頭比從前多，禮拜也不放，工錢反少了一角，連賞錢也没有：不過，無論如何，我是嫉妒的。　　一天傍晚，她懶洋洋地走回來，臉很蒼白，起了些泡。她靠着門，「呵唷」一聲放下飯籃子，就抓着發癢的手指。手已經又像紙一般白了，指頭紋皺皺的丨腫得像長生果一樣，勾曲着，永遠不能伸直似的。連着肉的指甲黑了一半。手掌和手指兩旁的皮都起了泡；泡破了，就現着紅色的肉。記得從前在廠裏的時候，我們的手都成天浸在滾水裏，不停地抽着絲頭，讓車子捲起牠。我們的手就像她那樣子。現在失業期間，我們的才好些，而她的又變了！　　她告訴我，現在她們那裏的管車，比從前那個更壞，看見誰談話，也要把滾水來澆誰。她臉上的泡就是那傢伙澆水來盪的。　　有一天，看見大轉子的男入一拐一拐的回來，臉上帶着一塊黑紅的血跡。我知道他又挨打了。果然一會兒就聽見說，那傷痕是搶車子時給人家打的。因爲現在失業的人太多，車子不够拉，所以弄到搶，搶不着，就打，可是這回他吃虧了。我想大轉子今天又倒霉：因爲他的男人又會不燒中飯給她送去，今天又該挨餓了；誰知道更倒霉的事還在後頭。　　半夜的時候，一種尖呌的聲音從隔壁傳過來，把我從夢中驚醒。一醒我就知道大轉子又在捱她男人的打了。只聽見拳頭起落的聲音，凳子翻了的聲音，咒駡聲，摔碗聲。我眞替大轉子不平：她男人受了别人的氣就只曉得打老婆，而她受了廠裏的氣還要受男人的氣。想到這裏，我又慶幸自己没有嫁人了。我想起來去勸勸她們，但是太夜深，不好，依然睡我的了。　　第二天，我跑去，只見大轉子一個人在家，陰凄凄地躺在床上。髻散開了，頭頂的右邊光了一塊，血跡糢糊地，頭髮被扯去了。腰被打壞了，不能起床。我問她爲甚麽，她才說出，「他，我的中飯……」不斷的涙水就從她的眼角流下來了。咧着嘴，咬緊的牙齒發出恨恨的聲音。我知道她一定是爲了他男人没有送中飯埋怨幾句捱打的。大轉子雖是恨，仍然想着她的生活，說起廠裏，她的臉馬上現着倉惶的顔色。她請我去帮她請假一天。　　誰知第二天，大轉子挣扎着起床的時候，廠廟的一個小姊妹來向她說，廠裏已經把她開除了。没有雪　（六）  繆崇羣　　保衞界裏的中國崗警剛才走出車站來，着實驚異地看見了那麽多的人，那麽多的車輛和那麽多的行李。　　丨丨過端陽了，他想。　　丨丨關餉了，他想。　　丨丨三寳啊，他想。　　他邊走着邊想着，又想起了又應該理一理髮，和燙一燙澡了。順路他便走進了東昇平園。澡堂子裏冷冷清清没有幾個人，他心裏有些納悶。脫了衣服，拖着鞋，一屁股便在理髮處的大鏡子前面坐下了。三個理髮匠都没有活作，在那裏交頭接耳地像是談着什麽機密的事情。看見他來了，於是同聲地招呼起來：　　「七爺來啦，你忙罷？」　　「還好，你們好？」　　「好！」一個頭梳得頂光，牙齒頂黄的理髮匠已經拿起了理髮的剪子，遲疑了一會，把嘴對着七爺的耳朶低聲說：　　「今兒格東便門齊化門都關城啦。」　　七爺没有說什麽，在鏡子裏和理髮匠會了一下眼。　　「通州的車站已經轟平了，京外的人都逃上來了。今兒格早晨那麽大風，你瞧見那一羣飛機了没有？」　　「没打交民巷過。」　　理髮匠心裏也有些羨慕交民巷的安全了，想不起再說什麽了。看着七爺滿頭的黑頭髮，剪着剪着就剪光了。　　七爺抓了抓青頭皮，很覺得清爽適意。披上大毛巾就走下池子裏去了。　　三個理髮匠又聚在一起交頭接耳了。牙齒頂黄的那一個這回没有得到什麽交民的消息，想起了「二毛子」，就談了不少當年義和團殺洋人和八國聯軍進北京城的故事。　　不久對面座位上來了幾個老鄉，他們的話就終止了。其實老鄉們并不干涉他們，老鄉們心裏有比他們耳目中得來的更準確更實在的消息。　　「往上開麽？」　　「昨天夜裏統退下來了。」　　「不打了？」　　「拿什麽打呀，人死成海了！」　　………………　　看見這幾個死裏逃生的兵士，想到了我們北國的山山河的血涙。　七爺在池子裏痛痛快快地睡了一大覺，醒來的時候，電燈都已經接火了。隨便唱了幾段二簧，爲的是抖一抖他的神。他不知道外邊的天地是怎麽樣了，正如同他不知道他剛才睡了有多久和剛才的頭髮怎麽一下就剪光了一樣。　　伙計告訴他，今天晚上特别戒嚴，八點鐘以後街上就不許人走了。</p>

<h3 id="c131">體育訴訟 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>第二屆全國運動會時，曾聞有幾項打破世界紀錄，在世界的政治與經濟舞台上我們貴國都不能一較短長的當兒，不能不說對於這病弱民族大爭光彩。因之我們的愛國志士們，在這一事實中就找出一挽救國家振興民族的大道，傳檄而呼曰：「體育救國」。其義曰，國家民族之興盛，繫於健全之國民，而健全之國民，則有賴乎强壯身體，强壯身體，在於提倡體育，發展運動，其一片「古道熱腸」的心意，到也言之成理，振振有辭。</p>
<p>不過在這一「救國大道」中所表現出來的，却有不少「深致痛心」的事實。據報載，去年十二月十六日，交大與曁南舉行江南大學足球比賽，聘請中華運動裁判會會員沈回春作公證人，交大因敗北而遷怒於裁判員，學生秦紹基等竟將沈回春毆打重傷，雙方負氣不下，致向地方法院提起訴訟。以一國立之堂堂最高學府，爲此「比賽」之爭議問題，竟鬧到「對簿公庭」，無怪乎「社會輿情，爲之譁然。」這一問題，引起了全國體恊會董事長王正廷氏的出而調解，演成了體育界歷史上的「沈案」，實也是「舉國矚目」的驚人事件。</p>
<p>這一問題我們若眞以「體育救國」的眼光來觀察，牠何以産生，及對於社會的影響怎樣呢？我們在這裏就不能不嚕囌幾句。體育如以强健國民爲目的甚或以「救國」相標榜時，就絶不在豢養出幾個選手與「锦標」家，而應以擴大國民爲對象，進行一種廣泛的普及工作。因爲運動始終是以煆煉身體爲終極目的，絶不是爲運動而運動，或爲錦標，與銀牌而運動。</p>
<p>可是這一眞義，其未能被人了解，在體育而「界」，與乎運動而成「專家」的事實中就已經說明。在目前雖說各界都有不少的體育團體「球團」「球隊」，但在一般說來，運動之爲學生智識份子的專利品，特别是不少的學校當局將錦標銀盾看成爲招徠的廣告，培植選手與跑狗塲主人具有同樣的熱心，更是不可諱言的事實。在這一風猷之下，就造成兩種病態：一方面是體育的「貴族化」，而另方面是以運動爲職業爲安身立命之所的專家的虚榮。第一個事實的德政，可以看到許多學校的選手，不上課，不留級，吃牛奶，領津貼；而第二現象的表彰，就是不少的「球迷」，各學校女生的「拉拉隊」。因此，一方面培植豢養一方面炫耀虚榮的相互利用之下，産生了中國體育界多少不體面的事態，而所謂「沈案」者，實不過其中一鱗半爪而已。</p>
<p>這一轟動體育界的「沈案」，聽說經王正廷氏的出任調停，賴此「舌人」之力已經解决了，然而體育偏趨的病態現象，却依然如舊。每當我們花上五角一元在青年會中央運動塲出來，恍如進了一次跑狗塲跑兎塲之後，一想到許多身體羸弱而與體育隔絶的人民，没有地方没有可能去運動，總覺對此「體育救國」的前途，有無限「深致痛心」的感歎。</p>

<h3 id="c132">茶樓上 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>返鄉瑣記</p>
<p>獨自跑出門來，却没有可以走的地方。故鄉對於我已那般生疏，我再向那老樹和破屋留戀地瞥了一眼，就踏着似曾相識的石子路無聊耐的向前走去。</p>
<p>許多人在我眼前溜過，許多房屋在我面前溜過，我像做着夢。這里是否我的故鄉，那問題在我面前將我向大街上引去。</p>
<p>「望江樓」三字映進了我的眼簾，這是我從前每天憇休之所。我並不嗜茶，不過聊以解悶而己；却現在成了習慣。當時似乎被誰催促着踏了進去，那掌茶爐的驚奇地「Ｘ家少爺回來了？」他直望着我坐到茶座上去。他不會做夢嗎？我想：</p>
<p>望江樓靠着故鄉惟一的官道起造的三層樓，美其名而望江，就是取這個意思。這里有每天常到的茶客，風雨不更，而且有固定的座位（我從前也是這末一個）五年來，大概這茶樓也變遷，不少的人不復是我認識的了。有幾個因了茶傅士的「Ｘ家少爺」而和我點起頭來，或問一句「上海回來？」那樣勉强。我不再屬於故鄉，故鄉把我遺望了！</p>
<p>那　新興的茶客，却没有和往昔異樣。他們　天說　，農村破産的他們没有關係，他們都是大佃主，現在談到的　　　　　問題了。某姓昨日Ｘ元Ｘ角糶出幾百担，某姓今日糶米又漲了兩角。我似乎厭惡他們那樣没有表情的態度，然而自己從前不是也這般過來的嗎？我眞被故鄉遺棄了。</p>
<p>那個坐在角落里的老先生，從前是我們下象棋的同伴，現在他開口了：「聽說要壩官道開河哩？」</p>
<p>這問題給了每個人一種刺激。壩河和囤米恰是個相尅的題目，於是一陣不入於正題的討論；恰適一個茶客進來，話題就轉到昨夜那茶客家中的一塲牌九；某的手色好，某一個莊「塌」了幾千元，並且還有能背出昨夜某一條牌九的情</p>
<p>形，有聲有色。我張大了眼，好像我昨夜也是個賭客。</p>
<p>「修道殺妻！」誰喊出來了。茶樓上需要的正是這種新聞，所以頂起碼的茶樓也有一份時報，望江樓何况是個大茶樓哩！</p>
<p>一羣人包四眰擎報的座前，搶着看，高聲朗讀。每個人明瞭情節之後，開始討論，然而没有主席。有的將從前相似的案子比較，有的……不一時談到女子的月經，生殖器，老年人和小伙子一樣，談到這些問題，總是笑迷迷的。提議壩河的老者，忘了家中囤着的幾千担米，要因此而損失，昨夜輸錢的賭客，也忘了「塌」的幾千元都是雪白的大洋錢。</p>
<p>我　　　走到小　　　在　斗　　　　意衞生」底下兩行極大的字，「諸　小，便，請進一步。」我臨窗向下望，漏斗的目的地就是這條望江的官道。故鄉没有抽水馬桶，也没有早上「吔···」的倒老爺，他們清理馬桶惟一的塲所是仰給於這條官道的，致於河内傾倒垃圾，更是應該的事。所以無論茶樓上的「水」就從這河内挑起來，「小便」而「請進一步」到漏斗里是屬於「注意衞生」的。</p>
<p>我回到座頭上，不敢再舉起那茶壺來，心中怪膩的想作噁。那一邊「修道殺妻」的提案還没有付表决，而莫明其妙的第二個提案「今夜的賭局」又發生。這似乎比較易容解决，一個塲所繼續在昨夜的茶客府上舉行。</p>
<p>不覺的暮色已從四面奔集攏來，一個下午作了結束，許多問題抛置了歸家去，或者此後永久不再談起這類問題。他們牢記的是今夜的賭局，明天茶樓上的談許題可以臨時發生，今夜不必急急乎籌備；而且……什麽呢？我第二天没有到望江樓來。</p>

<h3 id="c133">花瓶 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>這封通信到達貴編輯部後，希望你</p>
<p>在三日内覆我。这三天是多麽可寳貴的時間啊！如果過了這個時限，我就决定走我的道路了。我是何等的盼望有緣得讀先生的啓示喲！</p>
<p>問題是這樣的：我是一個高小畢業生，現在某一家寫字間内做「花瓶」丨痛心語丨我在許多「花瓶」中是頗得經理青睞的，其實，那位人面獸心的東西是對我不懷好意的。在三個月内，我受他四次侮辱的調笑，我都很巧妙的逃過他的圈套了。到了去年年關，我本想馬上辭職，以尊重我們女子的人格，但是，一想到，我失業後眼望着父母弟妹餓死，我又覺得這是忍辱好，祗要自己機靈點，有了鐵石的冰心，他是不能屈伏我的，我又懼怕什麽呢？不料，這不可測的人間險惡，竟出我望外的在襲擊我了。　　就是上禮拜五晚上，那東西堅約我同另一個同事談話，外表上說是商量公事，但不是在寫字間内，却在一個旅舍開了一間房間，我們踏進旅舍後就知道他的用意了。自然，不是談公事，因爲寫字間的男女同事一個也没有，只有他一個跟僕在内。他辦了許多酒菜欵待我們，我是只有憤怒與設防，並無心同他鬼混的　不想，　　來得愈出愈　　到　　　　後，又來子一個　，　　　　　　的　　　他　　　特别對我們親近。說了許多無謂的話。後來經理竟將我那位女同事騙到另一房間去了。那位少爺也不再來了。這時房内祗有他同我。設計要將酒灌醉我，我堅拒不飮，一直閙到十二點，我堅要去，他偏不許，我呌了，哭了。茶房偏偏裝做不知不覺。我知道他用了錢，一切他都佈置好了的。這時我只凖備同他拚死。是不成功的，於是，就改變爲哀求和金錢的軟工了。先生我們就是這樣鬧了一夜。我終未被克服。</p>
<p>先生丨在這「青天白日」下的上海，竟有如此侮辱職業女子的事，你能相信嗎？</p>
<p>我在第二天破曉回到家來。哭了一天。我本來是不再去工作了的，但家庭不諒，反疑心我心中另有所屬，我祇得再爲了家人，忍辱含羞去做事，不想，這禽獸故意放出了穢言，造成了醜惡空氣，以使我入圈套，使我屈服。我第三日一進寫字間，我看了許多同事有的在憤怒，有的在冷笑，竟還有人向我道喜，天呀！我不等到工畢就哭回家了。</p>
<p>我受了這種侮辱後，先生！我再不能忍受了。再不能顧忌父母弟妹了。我已無路可走，我還有什麽希望呢！到處對於女子不都是一樣啊？我又何必活着受他人們的蹂躪呢？</p>
<p>先生！我决定我只有走艾霞女士的道路啊！</p>
<p>但是，我覺得還有一綫希望，然是想能找到第一奮鬥的途徑。（不是怕死）艾霞女士的死已引起過人家的批評了，說是認識不够，先生！我現在境遇不如艾霞，能力不如艾霞，但我生死以前還想有人指示我，我不想再榮受一個「認識不够」的罪名於人世。先生！我們女子果眞還有路走嗎？　名暫隱三月五日</p>
<p>編者讀完上面這封通信後，不禁顫慄起來，眼涙也不禁奪眶而出了。在萬分緊張的心绪中，我忙找發信的時日。幸而這封信的日期是五日，隔今天還不過兩天，現在旣得此機緣，編者敬以萬分誠摯之心，以告某女士。並質之女界中職業的女同胞及一切關心婦女問題善良的人們！</p>
<p>關於某女士的問題，在今日的社會中確不是一件，很惹人驚訝的事，這已是一件公開的秘密，天天會在各處發生的社會上是認爲它太平凡了，不値得一顧。千千萬的女子，在這沉默中或接受了這種蹂躪，或自殺了。自殺後社會上也不見得會惹起什麽驚異，到落得一些無聊的小報造無賴的香艶的材料。所以！在這樣社會中，等女士呼出：「我們女子果眞道有路走啊？」不是出於她的軟約，反而是顯出今日婦女問題的敬重性。某女士的問題自然更不是她個人的問題，而是職業婦女所共有的一個嚴重問題。</p>
<p>某女士的奮鬥材料，我們非常的欽敬，在這般冷視的社會中，卽會於萌自殺之念，我們也不能嚴責伊，我們祇有同情，祗有能找到開導她的機會，加增她的認識，别無他法可說。更何况女士明明自己要求「另找一奮鬥的途徑呢，編者寫到這裏，越使自己感到不安，張眼望望今日報紙上天天印出的可驚的自殺新聞，我想，大半都是還想活着，却又找不到第一奮鬥途徑的人。因爲她們没有某女士的能力或認識的程度，結果是在這矛盾中死了。責任固然是由社會負，但偷生的我們却還缺乏指導的作用，我想，如果社會有好好的指導，在這大的自殺羣中，定可救出許多有爲的青年男女，將他的生命用到零一好大品奮鬥的途徑去。</p>
<p>以下答覆某女士：</p>
<p>若照普通的解釋，某女士旣然不甘再受這種侮辱，那最好的辦法是辭去不幹，其次，是給那經理一個嚴重的警告，告訴他以後如再有不當行爲，定要法律從事。但是第一個辦法，某女士已經知道是不成功，她不能看着家裏人「餓死」。至於警告更是笑話，因旣你現在旣然還要在他手底下做事，你那裏還敢再得罪他呢？你固然愛惜名譽愛惜身體，但「吃飯也是要同樣顧及到的啊！</p>
<p>所以問題的癥結是：在經濟鎖鍊之下，婦女受到侮辱並不是一椿奇事，這是人用經濟勢壓迫人的社會上必然會産生的。因此，某女士要眞正謀解放，不是辭職不幹，另找别業，「到處對於女子都是一樣」的；而是能把一切努力集中到改造社會上去。這决不是唱高調，也不是一條遙遠的路！迂迴的路。因爲在這個社會上，每個人所感覺到的痛苦，决不是能够用個人的努力所可解决的，惟有社會的根本改造後纔有辦法。</p>
<p>這固然是遙遠的路，但是苦命的我們，除了這條路還有什麽路好走！而且路，祇要走，不管怎麽遙遠，終究是會走到的。</p>

<p>— 意大利M賽拉歐著景心譯</p>
<p>「父親是滿意了，我的姑母們全送來她們的慶祝，我的表姊妹們是在生氣了，我的朋友們在咖啡店裏諷嘲地恭賀我，我的好朋友們握着我的手；所以我的結婚是很有道理的。我不能否認露露是非常地美麗；當她的眼裏那麽充滿着玩皮凝視着我，當她大聲地笑露出了白牙齒，我就想雙手抱住了她的小頭一遍一遍地吻。她的態度高雅，性格活潑，總是愉快而親切，總好講笑話而又機警，無時不在惡作劇，從没有憂鬱過，我們一定可以性情相投。我討厭那種板面孔的樣子，特别是對於自己所愛的人。我好像覺得在那種樣子裏，是隱藏着一種秘密的憂傷，我没經騐過這種憂傷，也不曉得怎樣對付，或者也許這種憂傷就是由我而起的。蘇菲亞丨丨我的未婚的妻姊，便有這種用她的冰冷的無感應的面孔煩擾我的本領。每當一看見她，我的知慧便無用武之地了，微笑離開了我的嘴唇；這時縱是有最美麗的春天的太陽在閃耀着，我也好像是被驅逐到灰色的十一月天裏，這時就是和露露我都没有勇氣說笑了；那位蘇菲亞小姊把一切的歡快都趕跑了。她也許已經看出她給與我的這種不愉快的印象，因爲她同我說話並不看我，不和我握手，以最簡單的言語回答我的問話。她一定曉得我是不歡喜她的了。也許她是因爲這件事情在生氣。</p>
<p>「露露總是大聲地笑着。她是非常地年青。她從没有對我說過一句嚴重的話語，就是她想要嚴重的時候，也好像她是在開玩笑。她是愛着我的，然而並没有達到熱狂的程度。坦白的講，我的愛也不是熱狂的；這樣子頂好。在我這方面，我的心裏是確定了兩個原則：一對訂婚的情人，應當性情相投；第二，他們總不應該以一種狂暴的情熱開始。我們的情形便是如此，所以我和露露應當非常幸福。我們將遍遊義大利，但是不要怱忙，作着短短的旅行，極其舒適地享樂着，喜歡那兒便停在那兒，就連那些最無意味的事物也看一看。我們照這種樣子消度三個月；不，那還不够，我們可以預定下四個月；使露露在相當期間脫離開蘇菲亞的那種厭倦的，我將是很歡喜。但是，我問，那個女兒在她那樣年紀就這麽莊嚴是自然的麽？她必定有二十三歲了。她自己不肯明說。事實上，她是有着美麗的眼睛，有着一個　　的架子，如果她不是這麽好梎面孔，她可以愉快的。我打賭她將變成一個老處女；也許這就是她的秘密的痛苦，也許她曾發生過愛情，一次不幸的愛情？丨丨我很好奇地要知道她的板面孔的原因丨丨，我和露露獨在一起的時候，我要　問她丨丨</p>

<h3 id="c136">美國的電影刋物是否盡是公司或明星們的宣傳工具？ <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 密齊</p>
<p>（一）是的方面（上）</p>
<p>美國的電影刋物，卽以雜誌一類而言，共有二十二種。它們的銷數，最小的有十二萬六千，最大的有五十六萬五千。我數須要知道，美國的報紙雜誌，差不多它們的銷數，都是由一個銷數調查會檢定，而不能虚報的。因此，以二十幾種電影雜誌的銷數，合計起來，就形成了美國社會生活的一個生要部份，並且亦是美國文化的一面了。統計起來，每個月化一角二角錢去買些電影雜誌看的，一共八百八十萬人，倘若我們拿普通兩三個人看一本電影，這還是最低的統計，我們就可以知道每一個月看電影雜誌的人，總有二三百萬之譜。而它們的勢力，亦就很可觀了。</p>
<p>現在有人說，這些電影雜誌，都是好萊塢的忠僕，雇用的宣傳者，明星們的工具，它們掩飾了影城裏無數的罪惡，并且煽熾了那種性慾狂的影業，在美國社會上的勢力。好萊塢影戲生活，以及明星們的地位，都被他們描寫得金碧輝煌，不可迫視，而惟一的功用，不過是代影片公司作喉舌，替它們推廣銷路而已。</p>
<p>以上係一般人對於電影刋物進攻的開花彈。要證明以上的話的成立，他們又將這種雜誌的内容，考核了一下。他們發現了在這些雜誌裏面，有許多不實不盡的地方。第一就是道聽途說的Ｇossip。他們說這Ｇossip已經成了電影雜誌的中心成份。第一家雜誌所登載的，都是儘量的無稽空談，而没有一家肯尋求宣佈好萊塢的眞實景况的。照電影雜誌上所登載的看起來，好萊塢是美國惟一的樂園，世界上的天堂。差不多每一本雜誌，都有無稽空談的一欄的。它們都有它們的華爾德温吉爾（ＷalterＷinchelI好萊塢的一位名記者）。他們是無所不知，無所不曉的人；它們能鑽到每個人的心裏，每個人的家裏，去刺探新聞，以致一段新聞，神仙還没有曉得之前，他們已經知道了。這不是太渺茫無稽了嗎？</p>
<p>除掉了短篇的無稽空談之外，還有許多長文。這種長文那裏來的？它們卽使不是影片公司或電影明星，寫好了交給雜誌登載的，亦必是由關係方面授意發表的。它們的内容，亦是空虚得很，並無實質新聞。它們大都是根據於一個明星的Ｇossip發　鼓吹起來的。要是有一個聰明人去設法訪查一下，他就可以發現，每一次一段長文關於一個明星的生活，發表之後，接連着必登有一張影片公映，而那個受宣傳的明星，亦就是那張影片的主角。我們需要知道這種電影雜誌的編輯部，都是和廣告部通同一氣。無分彼此的。所以這些文章亦都是爲一張影片或一個明星而發的瞎吹瞎擂。它們爲了自身的收入起見，就心甘情願的爲公司當局利用了，去愚弄社會上的一般人。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c137">評「愛斯基摩」 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Eskimo丨大光明丨</p>
<p>當我們在一連羅曼主義的戀愛把戲的美國影片之淫靡的空氣中，偶然發現了這一「愛斯基摩」之後，我們亟應禮讚這一位作者W·S·范達克。不消說。我們應當給與這作品極高的評價。</p>
<p>爲了使讀者諸君對於他易於明瞭起見。在此約略的介紹。他於一九二七年，在南海攝製了一部「“WheteShadowintheSouthSea”」，一九二九年深入菲洲腹地攝製了「TraderHorn」，這是我們永遠不會忘懷的。至於這一影片，乃一九三三年在北冰洋所作。無疑的，這是一部偉大的作品。</p>
<p>先從故事的結構說起，在此可看出思想之一斑。</p>
<p>首先，我們所要知道的是他爲什麽要以北冰洋作背景？這固然是因着冰山雪地的奇景，可作爲銀幕上的奇觀，而我們現在所要注意的，却是他如何採取素材以及如何處理題材，在這中間我們便可認識他的世界觀了。</p>
<p>「愛斯基摩」除了介紹了當地土人的生活和習慣之外，更展開了他們的純樸與勇敢的性格。他們是原始的生活着，他們爲了生存而與大自然奮鬥。他們狩獵爲生，當他們没有冬糧的時候，他們必須冒險的獵取海馬或白熊之類。他們是文明世界之外的人羣，他們没有銳利的軍器，甚至於没有一枚鐵針。他們之間没有戰爭或任何仇怨。他們和平而仁愛的生活着，他們不懂得文明人一切奸詐虚僞的行爲。</p>
<p>然而正因爲如此，他們被帝國主義的白種人當作無知識的野蠻人。於是白種人便以幾盒鐵針或一根鳥槍以換取他們無數極珍貴的獸皮，而且任意淫狎他們的婦女。然而他們可以禮讓的從他人的妻女身上得着安慰，却不能任自己的妻女給文明人强暴的奸汚，所以他們反抗着，殺死了人面獸心的所謂文明人。他們不懂得法律，他們也不知道什麽是他們應受的刑罰。當馬拉被文明人欺騙的擒獲之後，他才知道自己新手救活的白種人，現在是將自己置於死地的劊子手了。他們爲了自由與和平，到底挣脫了帝國主義的枷鎖。他們從白種那裏所受到的毒害是在雪地冰天中逃走。他們不會使用文明人之軍器以獵取野獸，在飢餓中只好殺家大充飢。</p>
<p>啊！在這裏暴露了文明人的奸詐，虚僞，殘暴，乃至於一切帝國主義的眞面目。被認爲野蠻民族的「愛斯基摩」的人們，除了與大自然努力奮鬥之外，還得逃避所謂文明人的毒害。在這裏使我們立刻想起了布朶敷金的「亞洲風雲」。原始生活的蒙古人，被帝國主義者欺騙虐待，壓迫，乃至於慘無人道的屠殺，到最後原始的蒙古人到底起來了，到底揭穿了帝國主義的眞面目而發動了反帝戰爭。同樣，在這「愛斯基摩」的作者却没有更進一步的認識，范達克所能做到的只有以眞實的同情來描寫這原始的人羣之可愛的生活和個性。他祗知道他們應當爲愛情而反抗，他只對於帝國主義者加以側面的譏諷，他熱忱的同情野蠻人之運命，直至馬拉被驅逐於溶解了的冰塊上逃亡時，他使那年輕的白種人發現天良的而不將他置於死地。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們當然不能在美國發現與布朶敷金一樣的導演，然而有了這一影片，也未嘗不是美國影片中之珍貴的寳物。我們看罷，在對白中他咒駡了所謂文明人，他坦白的敎純樸的「愛斯基摩」的人們仇恨英國人而與文明人斷絶往來。其同情被壓迫民族與憤恨帝國主義的熱情，充分的流露於畫面之間。</p>
<p>不錯，他是一個進步的人道主義者，他有着自由主義的世界觀。在這影片中，雖然是傷感也罷，他究竟是偉大的展開了被壓迫民族之痛苦。誰是野蠻人？請大家想想罷。</p>
<p>重說一句，在没有進一步的理解之前，他所能做到的只是人道主義的傷感。當他在最後用首極沉痛的葛雷菲士在「賴婚」中所用的手法的時候，他使馬拉在雪地中逃亡。没有食物在殺盡了家狗之後，再與野狼搏鬥。爲了逃避白人之絞刑，只得在溶解着冰塊上帶着妻子隨波逐流，乃至於不知所終。這悲哀沉痛的詩的情調，無疑的深深地刺激了觀衆的心胸。所以，在導演手法上，其最成功的便是調子上的捉摸。至於畫面的整潔，對於每一愛情塲面之細膩，以及對於狩獵塲面之緊張，可謂神妙之至。難道還有誰認爲母親喂乳或馬拉之後妻的袒胸歌唱是誨淫的「香艶」「肉感」嗎？他於地地的風聲，寒夜之犬的哀鳴，……其善於處理聲片之音響，於此可見。至於幾個「愛斯基摩」藉的演員，如男主角飾馬拉者云兩個女主角，都演得極好，特别是男主角在挣脫鐵練時，與飾其後妻者在小屋中歌唱時；更顯出表演的天才。據說這二人已爲范達克先生帶回好萊塢了。</p>
<p>總之，這是一部極有價値的影片。謹介紹於讀者諸君之前。</p>
<h3 id="c138">評「地獄英雌」 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>BloodMoney丨南京丨</p>
<p>「博愛里」是粗獷的，生動的，有一種奔放的氣勢，雖然它是意識地宣傳着帝國主義的侵略戰爭，但我們可以從那裏看到美國下層社會的眞實。</p>
<p>而「地獄英雌」却是幽雅的，平凡的，用紆緩的調子描寫了一個戀愛故事，然而所謂下層生活的暴露，除了開頭有一些夜總會裏的草裙艶舞，靡靡之音以外，簡直看不到什麽了。</p>
<p>但是，我們得承認，美國的確有着像培萊這樣的下層社會的巨霸。</p>
<p>他是一個結交官府，專以債劵代人具保的流氓。他的生活是玩女人，玩跑狗塲，打高而夫球，完全是個遊手好閒之徒。</p>
<p>另一種的人物是特魯意，專做巨案的大盜，然而我們不能從他的外表看出來。</p>
<p>我們不能從培萊與持魯意的身上找出根本不同的社會背景，他們都是近代都市中流氓無産者的上層分子。因之，我們從「地獄英雌」中只能看到他們的文雅的享樂的生活，而不是粗率的遊蕩生活。</p>
<p>然而，「地獄英雌」中的愛蘭玲却是更値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>美國資本主義的發展已達到爛熟　，一切的社會的上升與進步，都已停止，而只能看出它的衰减，死亡，腐朽的徵候，雖然我們特别應該指出那裏生長着的一種新興的朝氣的因素</p>
<p>近代社會的權勢者的生活，因之達到了一個墮落的，平凡的，醜惡的最高點，於是一切的最大的需要是不平凡的剌激，在那没有了絲毫生氣的社會羣中流行着空想與好奇。</p>
<p>女子在近代社會的解放，本來是不澈底的，然而現在，畸形的社會制度下的女子已不能滿足，性的享樂，以及其他一切高級的雅緻的享樂生活，於是她們更發展了好奇與空想。在美國，女子選擇丈夫的標凖，竟有捨棄紳士，而就流氓者，無非是這種現象的一種精華。</p>
<p>愛蘭玲便是這樣的女子，從這裏，我們却可以看出美國社會的腐朽的程度，和新因素的成長與揚棄這個舊社會的必然丨雖然「地獄英雌」的劇作者是不會理解到這一點的。</p>
<p>演員中的喬治貝洛夫，他在一年前不高興攝製他不願演的影片而脫離了「電影圈」，現在重進了二十世紀公司，因爲他的願意，我們在銀幕上看到的，也覺得他確很努力。</p>
<p>導演的手法用「劃過」甚多，而他的零亂，總有點不可掩飾的被我們感覺着。</p>

<p>亞萊克賽於是就獻上禮物，送給蘇斐亞的係到北方去用的禦寒之物，送給育漢娜的是俄國女皇的一幀御容，四面鑲嵌着珍寳。育漢娜一方面向大使道謝，一方面因旣蘇斐亞默然無言，覺得有些生氣，就示意給她，呌她說話。蘇斐亞粉面上起了一陣紅雲，好看着俄國女皇的御容，就問亞萊賽道：「你没有帶一個皇太子的像來嗎？」亞萊克賽公爵笑道：「你要呌他比一切的男子還要好看嗎？」蘇斐亞露着侷促的神氣道：「可不是嗎。」亞萊克賽道：「好，皇太子正是你所希望的，或者還要好些。他有高高的身材，像一個希臘的神。他的眼睛，像青天般青，他的頭髮，像烏木那樣光緻。他的强壯，可以敵得住一隊牛。他現在廢寢忘食的等待你去。」公爵話雖滔滔不絶地說着，但是他的眼睛，好像罩了一層黑紗，隱藏着什麽秘密似的。蘇斐亞的母親吩咐她退出去，她就很客氣地向亞萊克賽道了謝，退出去了。她到門口的時候，她又躊躇了下下，回過頭來向那遠道來的大使瞟了一眼。她的心跳躍着，就像驚鴻似的，飛奔上樓到自己的寢室裏去了。她到了寢室裏，就把她的洋囡囡取了出來。她和它低低地說道：「蘇斐亞弗勒德里加，你開心嗎？你要嫁人了你要有男人了。我就是你的俄國丈夫，一個大大的俄國大公皇太子。我們不久就要結婚了。」她說完了，默然地深思着。她立卽覺得好像有什麽畏懼似的，使她的雙眉緊縐起來。她將離開自己的家庭，……離開她親愛的父親，……離開她的母親，她在婚禮告成之後，當然要回到普魯士的，……她的保姆卡都爾，……她的敎授華格臬，……以及他所知道習慣的一切生活，……去到那遠在北方，生疏，寒冷的異域，……她又想到那俄國大使送來的皮衣和暖水袋等，她就覺得有些不寒而慄了。（未完）</p>

Because the truth is unknown, I have sent a telegram to inquire, and a reply should arrive in Nanjing in ten days. (Special Dispatch of the 7th)</p>

Negotiations will be held with the Japanese side, and the Japanese Embassy will send a telegram to the Kwantung Army. The Embassy has received a reply telegram, saying that after Matsui returns to Changchun, the Japanese troops in the three ports will be ordered to withdraw.

<h3 id="e21">Quickly Eliminate the Harm of Red Pills and White Powder <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Our country's biggest harm in the north recently is not necessarily from imperialists, nor necessarily from bandits and local bullies and corrupt officials, but from the general decline of life that comes from the decline of the rural economy, followed by the harm of red pills and white powder. Based on the general situation, observing society, we cannot find the benefits of red pills and white powder anywhere. Even those who take red pills and white powder believe it is very harmful. Then why must they take it? Why do they knowingly choose this chronic suicidal policy?</p>
<p>I believe the biggest reason is the abnormal phenomenon of the rural economy being on the verge of bankruptcy. Farmers' lives in the provinces and regions north of the Yellow River are even more difficult. Even in years of good harvest, ordinary farmers cannot exchange their labor for their minimum necessary living needs. Therefore, two phenomena are found in northern rural areas: one is that the nutrition of farmers' lives is insufficient, and their physical strength gradually declines with insufficient nutrition. Although northern farmers are said to have relatively strong inherited bones and thicker qualities, most ordinary farmers now have hungry faces, showing signs of insufficient nutrition. Thus, work efficiency naturally declines. However, in terms of social needs, they are required to dedicate all their abilities, so they naturally seek a stimulant that is sufficient to excite them. Another is that the northern rural economy has evolved into a lifeless state. Ordinary people cannot even support their necessary lives, and all other entertainment is naturally completely absent. However, ordinary people always need entertainment. Since proper and beneficial entertainment is not available, they can only seek momentary stimulation, treating this stimulation as happiness. Moreover, taking red pills and white powder is more convenient than smoking opium, so it has spread universally.</p>
<p>This situation was limited to a small number of people and a small number of regions in the past few years. Although the harm was very severe, it was not very great. If we could do our best to ban it and impose legal sanctions, it would not be difficult to eliminate it. However, now this kind of poison is spread very widely in the northern provinces and regions. Even ordinary urban workers have a lot of infections. Recently, it has also spread from north to south, and the lower-class masses in the Yangtze River basin are also suffering from infection. Unexpectedly, the harm of red pills and white powder has become a major problem for the entire China.</p>
<p>We can still awaken the masses to fight for national interests against imperialist aggression. Bandits and local bullies and corrupt officials can be eradicated as long as we can seriously rectify politics. Only the poison of red pills and white powder, once addicted, becomes more and more toxic. A good person becomes a useless person, and a group of good people also becomes a group of useless people. Because ordinary people always need a healthy physique to bear heavy burdens and carry out major events. If the physique is bad, both big and small things will be impossible to carry out. Moreover, this kind of harm is inherited, not only is the current economy in trouble, but the future may inevitably lead to bankruptcy, and even make future generations suffer the same pain. This is seriously related to the rise and fall of the race and the survival of the nation, so we must not take this matter lightly.</p>
<p>From a passive point of view, persuading people to quit and strictly prohibiting its sale is the only urgent measure. But we have all tried or are vigorously promoting it, and what is its effectiveness? We can fully understand this by looking at the situation in Shanxi. In other words, in the current situation of global recession, it is unlikely that people will not do wrong, that people will abide by the law and know shame, and that people will not try to make windfall profits. Therefore, in addition to imposing sanctions from a passive point of view, we should also supplement it with active measures.</p>
<p>We believe that active measures should not only prohibit the sale of poisons, but also fundamentally prevent people from taking them. Naturally, the method of preventing people from taking them is not easy, nor can it be effective in a short period of time. Because the force of social sanctions [i.e., public morality, public right and wrong criticism] cannot be cultivated in a short period of time. The cultivation of education and the cultivation of knowledge both require a considerable amount of time. What is particularly important is the stability of the economic foundation. If we can improve the living standards of ordinary people in rural areas, rebuild the rural economy that is on the verge of decline, and farmers know that they can live and develop upwards, and then promote public, proper, and rational entertainment, then this kind of poison that only has a temporary stimulating effect will naturally disappear.</p>

<p>(London) - After 30 minutes of negotiations between Britain and Japan, they were changed to private discussions, and then the meeting was resumed, but no agreement could be reached, and the meeting was adjourned immediately. A statement was later released, stating that the conference had reached a dead end on the issue of the scope of discussion. This is regrettable for both British and Japanese representatives. However, in view of the seriousness of this issue, it was agreed to postpone the meeting until tomorrow.</p>
<p>(7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) - The failure of the British-Japanese cotton textile industry negotiations has now been confirmed. However, both sides want to shift the responsibility for the failure to the other side, so the representatives of the two countries may not openly announce a break at today's meeting. The current question is whether the British government will immediately take retaliatory measures after the failure of the negotiations. According to general opinion,</p>
<p>If the British Empire completely prohibits the import of Japanese goods, domestic prices will inevitably rise, which is not what the British government wants. Therefore, a complete ban on the import of Japanese goods will be difficult to achieve. The British government will try to contact Western countries that are also affected by Japanese competition, so as to unite with each other for protection. Regarding this matter, it is heard that Britain has already started negotiations with the Netherlands. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) - This morning's meeting of representatives of the British and Japanese organizing industries did indeed come to a standstill. However, because the matter is important, the meeting was postponed until tomorrow. It is heard that this postponement was the result of contact between the Lancashire representatives and the British government. This deadlock was caused by the question of whether the scope of discussion should include the world market or only the British and its colonial markets. If the negotiations completely break down, the demands for protecting the British business market and preventing Japanese competition will inevitably become more intense than before, and this issue may be handled by diplomatic means. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The atmosphere of the meeting between the British and Japanese people's representatives on the 7th was quite dangerous. The Japanese representatives had a strong attitude and did not hesitate to break up the meeting. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoping that the meeting would be successful, has ordered Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain to contact the Japanese delegation to prepare to resolve the crisis. According to Japanese observations, the result of the breakdown of the British-Japanese meeting is that the Manchester cotton industry in Britain will inevitably advocate (1) abolishing the British-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, (2) excluding all Japanese-made goods, and (3) third countries with economic relations with Britain should unanimously join the front line and implement the anti-Japanese goods movement. The British government, which had previously appeased the anti-Japanese movement, will also resort to extraordinary measures. The Japanese government feels that the occurrence of this kind of incident is unfortunate, and intends to resolve the negotiations by the governments of the two countries. Preparations are now underway. The post-mortem negotiations between Ambassador Matsudaira and British businessman Francis are likely to be realized soon. (7th Japan United Electric)</p>
<p>(London) - The representatives of the Lancashire side attending the British-Japanese meeting arrived in London late on the 6th, and said that if the Japanese side's attitude does not change drastically at the final stage, the main meeting on the 7th will inevitably break down. It is also heard that when this inevitable situation arises, the Lancashire representatives and others have already made detailed studies on future countermeasures. Their opinions are roughly as follows: The breakdown of the British-Japanese meeting is very regrettable, but even if it breaks down, the position of the British cotton industry will still be solid, because the total amount of British imports accounts for 15% of the world, and its exports only account for 6%. Moreover, if Britain concludes this kind of trade agreement with various countries in the future, it will be extremely beneficial compared to Japan. Therefore, if the meeting on the 7th ends in a breakdown, Britain and its directly governed colonies should adopt a double import discount system to protect them. (7th Japan United Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The British-Japanese cotton industry meeting is facing an impasse due to opposing opinions and cannot be salvaged. It is feared that the meeting today will break down immediately. The Japanese foreign affairs authorities are studying the policies to be adopted in the future. The foreign affairs authorities believe that if the British-Japanese meeting breaks down, it is necessary to leave room for the possibility of continuing negotiations in the future. Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain is also making every effort in this regard. However, before the start of the meeting, the British side had petitioned the British government that if the meeting breaks down one day, please raise tariffs on Japanese goods and abolish the British-Japanese Treaty of Commerce. In view of this, the Japanese government believes that if the negotiations break down, the British government will definitely consider what measures to take. If the British government intends to transfer the issue to government negotiations, the Japanese side also intends to agree. At this time, it will not be limited to cotton industry relations, but will take a broader view of the overall situation of British-Japanese trade and draft specific proposals to adjust the entirety of British-Japanese trade and engage in negotiations.

<p>Dutch East Indies Resists Japanese Goods, Japanese Chamber of Commerce Protests</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Because the Dutch East Indies government will restrict the import of Japanese goods, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry has adopted strict measures, and will suggest that all national chambers of commerce and industry approve it, hoping to promote diplomatic negotiations by the Japanese government authorities. Today, the following recommendations have been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry: The Dutch East Indies has previously restricted the import of cement, beer, and salong. This time, it has implemented an unfair distribution system for bleached cloth, and plans to implement the same distribution system for general groceries. If so, Japan's sales routes over the past 30 years will completely collapse. At this juncture, it is hoped that the government will strongly protest to the Dutch East Indies government and seek effective and appropriate measures. (7th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Today, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry sent a telegram in the name of Chairman Go to the Governor of the Dutch East Indies, the Minister of Dutch Colonies, and the Dutch East Indies Chamber of Commerce, protesting as follows: The import distribution to be implemented by the Dutch East Indies will have an adverse impact on the trade relations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. I hope you will be cautious. The Economic Alliance will also convene a standing committee on the 8th and then issue a protest telegram with the same purpose. (7th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>Child has Set Out for Europe</p>
<p>(Washington) - Before setting out for Europe to investigate the economic situation today, Child visited President Roosevelt. Someone asked about the possibility of reconvening the World Economic Conference. Child replied that he did not suggest whether the conference should be reopened and that it should be decided by other countries. Child served as an advisor to Secretary of State Hull at last year's economic conference. This time, he will travel to Europe and discuss issues such as monetary stability and war debts with European politicians. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) - It is widely rumored here today that Dr. Child's upcoming trip to Europe is clearly related to President Roosevelt's future tariff policy and his hope to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements with various countries. President Roosevelt's intention is that the most important task now is to collect the latest and reliable information on the economic situation in Europe. Most people do not believe that the World Economic Conference will be reopened soon. However, yesterday, a message from the State Department stated that Child's trip to Europe was with the hope of reopening the conference. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) - French Minister of Commerce Reynaud will go to London this week to begin British-French trade negotiations. This is the most important commercial negotiation since the British Ottawa Conference. This time, we will seek to resolve some complex issues. The French Minister of Commerce will go to Britain with several experts. According to information obtained by Reuters reporters in Paris, the House of Representatives today passed a bill authorizing the government to order the cancellation of the 4% or 6% tax levied on British goods entering Japan. The significance of this bill is to restore the previous import tax rate to countries that levy the same tax rate as France and countries that have special measures with France, such as Britain. After the Senate passes the bill, the government will order the start of British-French trade negotiations to eliminate the trade war between Britain and France. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Five-Year Plan with Expenses of One Hundred Million Yuan</p>
<p>Building Over One Hundred Warships and Over One Thousand Airplanes</p>
<p>In Preparation for Dealing with the Far East Incident</p>
<p>(Washington) - The US Senate today passed the most advantageous naval bill of Vinson and Trammell by a vote of 65 to 18, stipulating the construction of 102 new warships and 1,184 naval aircraft, so that the US naval power meets the limits stipulated in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. In order to prevent abuses, the Senate has an additional clause that limits private companies building warships to a profit of 10%. It is thought that after the bill is submitted to the House, the approval of the additional clause can be guaranteed. Senator Nye of North Dakota, who has been striving to pass this bill, said that this bill is really the savior of munitions manufacturers. This bill has no special provisions, but it is estimated that naval expenses will be between $565,000,000 and $1,000,000,000 in the next seven years. The Vinson-Trammell American naval bill is actually a merger of two bills. One was proposed by Senator Vinson of Georgia, and the other was proposed by Senator Trammell of Florida. The nature of the two bills is roughly similar, and the construction of a 15,000-ton aircraft carrier to replace the old destroyers totaling 99,900 tons and submarines of 35,530 tons is really the urgent need of the United States today, so it should be voted on first. If we use the Washington Naval Treaty to constrain it, the United States is still short of one aircraft carrier, one heavy cruiser, five light cruisers, six destroyers, and thirty submarines today. This bill plans to build 1,184 new aircraft, of which 650 are already under construction. In addition, 534 others will be put out for bidding as soon as President Roosevelt approves them. According to Admiral Standley, Chief of Naval Operations, this bill can bring the US naval air force to the limit of 2,184 aircraft allowed by the treaty. It is said that the situation in the Far East is the biggest reason for the rapid establishment of the Vinson-Trammell bill. Vinson stated that because the US naval power is weak and the United States is not prepared to deal with the incident in the Far East, the power of the United States in the Far East has been greatly weakened. (7th Guomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Congressman Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, previously introduced a bill requesting $380,000,000 to be allocated over five years to build 102 warships, in order to expand the US naval military power to the limit permitted by the London Naval Treaty, and another $95,000,000 to add 1,184 military aircraft. The two bills were approved by the House of Representatives on January 30 of this year, and today the Senate also passed them by a vote of 65 to 18. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e36">British Cabinet Meeting to Guarantee the Safety of Law? <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Exchange for Concessions from France</p>
<p>(London) - The Cabinet Disarmament Subcommittee met this morning, with Lord Privy Seal Eden in attendance. The issue of security was discussed. People here believe that if Britain does not make a clear promise to France to guarantee compliance with the disarmament convention, it will be difficult for the French government to make any concessions on the issue of disarmament. The reason why the subcommittee is discussing the security issue today is for this reason. However, it is not yet known to what extent the British government is prepared to go on this path. The British Cabinet probably intends to first observe how foreign public opinion accepts the new attitude that Britain intends to adopt, and then it can make a decision. Yesterday, this newspaper's dispatch stated that political figures believed that the Disarmament Subcommittee might discuss a method to give France some satisfaction in security in exchange for French concessions in disarmament, and said that this kind of speculation was contrary to the opinions of most people in Britain, because general public opinion still does not want Britain to make any new promises to guarantee the security of continental countries. However, judging from today's situation, British public opinion seems to have changed, because the fact that Britain wants to test the intentions of various countries' public opinion with a new attitude is enough to prove that the degree of opposition of most people to Britain making new promises is not as great as before.

<p>No Peace in Europe Without Belgian Security</p>
<p>Brussels - Today, Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot made an important statement in the Senate on Germany's rearmament, saying that the great powers have recognized Germany's equal rights, and that there are statements prohibiting the use of force. Now, we can only use friendly negotiations to establish an agreement to limit armaments. He also said that if the country's security is not guaranteed, there will never be true peace in Europe. Belgium has made extraordinary sacrifices for the sake of peace. The Belgian government now wants to work hard to complete a disarmament convention and seek to obtain the greatest security with small sacrifices. Under this principle, we can not only obtain France's support, but also the support of Britain and Italy. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>And Solve the Unemployment of Millions of People</p>
<p>(Washington) - Employers oppose reducing working hours and increasing wages, because it will increase prices, which is opposed by consumers. Today, the NRA regulation personnel held a meeting to discuss the workers' claims that industrialists did not fulfill the collective negotiation clauses, and the complaints of different treatment in the north and south and different wages for men and women. They also discussed the general accusations that various regulations had not been followed. Judging from the phenomenon, President Roosevelt himself plans to order a 10% reduction in working hours and an increase in wages, except in cases where it is clearly difficult. Automotive tycoon Ford criticized President Roosevelt's address to Congress on Sunday, saying that the only way to enable more people to have jobs is to open up more markets and make the increased work profitable. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) - National Recovery Administration Director Johnson told people today that he investigated 600 industries, and 30% of them could reduce working hours again without reducing wages, and that the reduced working hours would be enough to absorb one million new workers.

<p>One Policeman Wounded in Resistance</p>
<p>Female Employee and Cash Stolen Together</p>
<p>Sioux Falls. Today, six audacious bandits robbed the Security National Bank here in broad daylight. The elaborate scheme was clearly premeditated, making it an unprecedented and shocking robbery for this area. The bandits sped to the bank entrance in a car. One person remained as the driver, while the others got out and entered the bank with a leisurely attitude. Once inside, the bandits suddenly produced guns, preventing the police inside the door from making any noise. One policeman attempted to draw his gun to resist but was shot and wounded by the bandits. The remaining police were also disarmed. All the bank employees were forbidden from moving, or they would be shot. After dividing up and seizing the cash, the bandits took a female employee out the door and into the car, using her as a shield to deter pursuers from opening fire. The car sped away. Police, alerted, pursued them to about two miles outside the city. The bandits placed the female employee in front as a shield and opened fire with a machine gun to repel the pursuers. The police, fearing they would injure the female employee, did not dare to shoot. The bandits drove another two miles or so, then abandoned their car and hijacked a passing car, speeding away. The police now believe that the ringleader must be Dillinger, the notorious bandit who escaped from Lake City Prison with a black man on March 3rd. During the pursuit, a handgun was recovered, and it was identified as belonging to Dillinger's gang. Dillinger has a long record of crimes and has escaped from prison twice. The police have now notified neighboring states and are working together to apprehend him. A close associate of Dillinger was arrested a few days ago in Pierre, South Dakota. Today, his trial for murder and prison escape began in Vermillion, South Dakota. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Jian'ou: Northern Fujian circles' rally for bandit suppression cables nationwide, unanimously supporting Wang and Jiang's true telegram. The original telegram reads: "We humbly read the true telegram of Director Wang and Chairman Jiang. The words are earnest and sincere, and the sincerity of planning for the country shines through the past and present. The country's affairs are difficult, and it is now at its extreme. Saving the country and preserving its existence, there is no other way than suppressing bandits and building. In recent years, the central government's decisions have indeed been a blueprint for revival. Your Excellency is responsible for vigorously implementing it, using a kind and gentle spirit to seek the realization of unity. Your public-spiritedness and decisiveness are admired by all. Now that the country is full of hope for governance, local rebellion suddenly arises. Former ones like Feng and Fang, and recent ones like Chen and Li, do not hesitate to harm the liver and brains of the people to satisfy their own selfish desires. Fortunately, Your Excellency's command is decisive, and the deployment is well-organized, so that the chaos can be quickly quelled and the foundation of the country can be re-established. Now, after the Fujian rebellion has been quelled, we reiterate the essentials of saving the country, earnestly using the meaning of suppressing bandits as a temporary solution and construction as the fundamental solution, with the central and local governments being sincere and cooperative, to inform the people. Anyone with blood and qi will rise up. Northern Fujian has suffered from banditry frequently, and the people are extremely impoverished. The pain is deeply felt, and the excitement is even deeper. Today, people from all walks of life gathered in Yanping, and the entire audience unanimously decided to swear allegiance to Your Excellency, implement our propositions, and send this telegram for your review." Now that lost territories have not been recovered, foreign insults are becoming more urgent, and world disaster is approaching. Governance, chaos, survival, and extinction all depend on this. We hope that everyone will agree on propositions and work together to save the crisis. The party and the country are fortunate. Northern Fujian Circles' Rally for Bandit Suppression bows to you.

<p>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Hold Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>Nearby Five Small Passes Also Received Simultaneously</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The reception of Gubeikou was originally scheduled for the 18th of last month. Later, due to issues such as the replacement of Japanese troops and the failure of puppet organizations to relocate, it was slightly postponed and changed to today (the 4th) to begin the reception. At 11:30 AM today, Chinese and Japanese representatives and related personnel held a grand reception ceremony at the Gubeikou Administrative Commissioner's Office. At the same time, the heads of our various agencies, Liu Youxun, the director of the Gubeikou Zozhi Bureau, Huo Shi, the director of the office, and Guan Qinghua, the chief of the Public Security Branch Bureau, assumed their posts and received administrative and police powers. The Japanese and puppet police posts were completely withdrawn, and our police maintained local order. The nearby five small passes also began to be received. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e97">Preparations <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Both Chinese and Japanese Sides Have Agreed on All Procedures in Advance</p>
<p>The puppet organizations completed their work on the 2nd and moved to the foot of the Great Wall on North Street. All the houses were left for the use of our office, the Zozhi Bureau, and the Public Security Branch Bureau, and other agencies to work. Our receiving commissioner Yin Rugeng, accompanied by Wei Yonghe, commander of the Third Security Corps of the War Zone, Huo Shi, director of the Gubeikou Office of the Administrative Commissioner's Office, and Liu Youxun, director of the Gubeikou Zozhi Bureau, departed from Beiping at 7:30 AM on the 3rd, arrived in Miyun at 11:30 AM, took a short rest, and then went directly to Gubeikou with Qiu Heting, the magistrate of Miyun County, and Xu Shiying, the commander of the Second Security Brigade, arriving at around 3:00 PM. They first went to the Gubeikou office to prepare all reception matters. They then met with Yongan Houde, the commander of the 25th Regiment of the Japanese Army and the garrison commander of Gubeikou, and others, and agreed on everything. Immediately, personnel were dispatched to post notices in various townships, announcing the date of reception, so that the public would know. They also ordered the receiving police stationed in Shixia to arrive at Gubeikou this morning (the 4th) to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Holding the Ceremony <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After all preparations were completed, the reception was carried out this morning, the 4th. Japanese Commissioner in Charge of Handover Matsui and Kwantung Army Staff Officer Major General Sakagaki also arrived from Chengde this morning to handle the handover. At 11:30 AM, the reception ceremony was held. The participants on our side were Commissioner Yin Rugeng, Security Corps Commander Wei Yonghe, Gubeikou Office Director Huo Shi, Miyun County Magistrate Qiu Heting, Gubeikou Zozhi Bureau Director Liu Youxun, Gubeikou Public Security Branch Bureau Chief Guan Qinghua, Security Second Brigade Commander Xu Shiying, Gubeikou Chamber of Commerce President Zhou Hongen, Livelihood Association President Duan Liying, Post Office Director Zhang Bingzhong, Beiping Postal District Inspector Liu Guangqi, Gentry Ma Wensheng, First Primary School Principal Geng Xiangming, and others. The Japanese side included Matsui, Acting Director of the Kwantung Army Resident Chengde Special Service Agency, Kwantung Army Staff Officer Major General Sakagaki, Yongan, representative of the 7th Division, and Team Attached Sanqiao, Consul Matsuoka, etc., as well as Chinese and foreign guests, totaling more than 200 people. After raising the Blue Sky White Sun flag, 10,000 cannons were fired. The participants took their seats separately. First, our representative Yin Rugeng delivered a speech, "Today, we are holding the reception ceremony for the Gubeikou area. Chinese and foreign officials and people are gathered together. I am very happy to be personally involved in this matter. In the past, a committee was set up to handle the reception of the war zone. Now, this committee has been abolished. All unfinished reception matters are entrusted to the administrative supervisors of Luanyu-Jimiyun area under the instruction of the Executive Yuan's Resident Peace Political Reorganization Committee. Gubeikou is located in the Jimiyun area, so the reception procedures are my responsibility. It is only today that the reception is being implemented. Gubeikou is a major town in terms of geography and history. In recent years, the local area has prospered and made progress day by day. It is necessary to expand the original administrative organs. It has now been approved by the Hebei Provincial Government to establish the Gubeikou Zozhi Bureau, which is subordinate to Miyun County and assists the county government in handling local administrative affairs in Gubeikou. The Gubeikou Public Security Branch Bureau will also be reorganized so that it can effectively maintain law and order. As for foreign affairs, they will be handled by the director of the Gubeikou Office of the Administrative Supervisor of Jimiyun area, acting under my authority. In short, after the reception of Gubeikou, two new institutions will be added, one is the Zozhi Bureau, which handles local administrative affairs, and the other is the office, which handles foreign affairs. These two institutions will also be established and start working today. From today onwards, the local heads of agencies and local people must work together in harmony, each fulfilling their responsibilities, and strive to make the local area even more prosperous so that Chinese and foreign merchants can live and work in peace. This is what I hope," etc. Then, Miyun County Magistrate Qiu Heting, Huo Shi, Director of the New Office in Gubeikou, Liu Youxun, Director of the Zozhi Bureau, and Matsui, representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, successively gave speeches.</p>

<p>After the speeches, all the personnel took a group photo in front of the venue to commemorate the occasion. At around 12:00 PM, the ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned.

Yin is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 6th to report on the reception. Japanese representatives Matsui, Sakagaki, and others will return to Chengde tomorrow (the 5th).</p>

<p>Gubeikou implemented the reception this morning (the 4th). The thirty-one police officers stationed in Shixia waiting for orders set out in two groups this morning to take over the defense. One group of twenty people set out from Shixia on foot at 6:00 AM this morning and arrived in Gubeikou at 9:00 AM, immediately setting up posts and watching. The positions of the Japanese and puppets were removed at the same time. Another group of eleven people, accompanied by Ma Xilin, councillor, and Han Jiasheng, branch director, set out from Gubeikou to the Caojialukou northeast of Gubeikou at 5:00 AM. They arrived at the pass at 10:00 AM and immediately took over the pass. The puppet organization in Gubeikou had moved to the foot of the Great Wall earlier. The houses they occupied were returned to our side and set up as the office, the Zozhi Bureau, and the Public Security Branch Bureau. Huo Shi, Liu Youxun, Guan Qinghua, and others took up their new positions and began to work after participating in the reception ceremony. The Administrative Commissioner's Office issued a notice to appease the people. The Zozhi Bureau Office and the Chief of the Public Security Branch Bureau also issued notices of taking office. The notice of the Administrative Commissioner's Office to appease the people is recorded below: "It is hereby announced that the Hebei Provincial Government has forwarded a letter from the Executive Yuan's Resident Beiping Political Reorganization Committee stating that the unfinished matters of receiving the counties in the war zone will be continued by the administrative supervisors of the Luan Yu Jimiyun areas of the province, etc. Following this, the outline of the methods for temporarily setting up administrative organs after the reception of Gubeikou was drafted and submitted to the Hebei Provincial Government for approval. Now, on February 28th of the 13th year of the Republic, the Gubeikou area will be received, and all administrative matters and local security will be handled separately by the Miyun County Government, the Gubeikou Zozhi Bureau, and the Gubeikou Public Security Branch Bureau. Foreign affairs will be handled by the Director of the Gubeikou Office of the Administrative Supervisor of Jimiyun area, acting under the authority of the Commissioner. In addition to separate royal letters and orders, it is hereby announced that all people of all walks of life are informed and must abide by laws and regulations and live in peace. This is of the utmost importance. This is hereby announced."</p>

Lanterns and high-legged races were also held at night to express their celebration. (March 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Qingdao Shipping Industry Declines <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: In this city, in addition to the Zhengji Shipping Co., Ltd. and the Dalian Steamboat Co., the rest are small capitalists who collectively operate a total of 28 steamers. The largest can carry 470 tons, and the smallest only 15 tons. They are based in Qingdao's small port and sail to various inland ports, such as Dalian, Longkou, Weihai, Yantai, Dabu Chuan, Rushan, Zhangjiabu, Shidao, Lidao, Chenjia, Wangjiatan, Shijiusuo, Taoluo, Lanshantou, Tuo Wang, Haizhou, Xiangshui Kou, Funing and other places. Two years ago, all those engaged in this industry benefited greatly because the commerce in various places developed and the import and export of goods increased. By last year, various places were affected by the global economic panic, and the import and export of goods almost completely stopped. As a result, this business fell sharply. Those who made a profit were mostly shareholders who supplied as much goods as possible, which had good results. Now the names of the ships, the shipowners, the tonnage carried, the number of sailors, and the business conditions last year are investigated as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e103">Sichuan-Kang Expedition Team Reaches Ya'an on Southern Route <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>丨Qiong Bamboo Near Extinction Due to Destruction丨</p>
<p>Ya'an Correspondence from Shanghai Correspondent for the Sichuan-Kang Expedition Team: After spending the discarded lunar new year in Chengdu, the team split into southern and northern routes on the morning of February 19th. Zhang Xianmei, Chen Youqin, and Liu Sida, along with a delegation of Chengdu elders organized to inspect bandit areas, departed together for northern Sichuan. The reporter, along with Lu Yi, Wang Zhenhuan, and Su Dezheng, departed for southern Sichuan to begin on-site research into the Kang-Tibetan issue. There were also three temporary companions: Li Zhongying, the compilation director of the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Supervisory Office; Li Xiaxuan, a reporter for the Sichuan Construction Daily; and Huang Fanggang, a professor at Sichuan University. Some provided assistance along the way due to local hospitality, while others participated in the expedition in a personal capacity. The journey from Chengdu to Ya'an is 340 li (approximately 170 kilometers). Originally, there was a direct automobile road, but due to the unstable roadbed and frequent rains in the counties under Ya'an's jurisdiction, it was only passable to Qionglai. On that day, the automobile traveled 80 li from Mindu (Chengdu), crossing the Min River in Xinjin County, which was very dangerous. It took two hours to get back on the car. In the afternoon, around 4 o'clock, they arrived in Qionglai and stayed in a small inn. Pigsties and chicken coops were everywhere, and it was very dirty. There were no meals or blankets. Most inland inns in Sichuan are like this. The reporters managed to eat something and spread out their bedding to sleep. At this time, they felt the need to bring their own blankets. That night, they asked the innkeeper to hire porters to send them to Ya'an by sedan chair and contacted the garrison for transportation and relay at different stations. On the morning of the 20th, after washing up, they set off in sedan chairs, walking along the highway. They would occasionally lower the chairs to allow the porters to rest. Moreover, nine out of ten sedan chair porters had an opium addiction. After traveling 20 li, they had to indulge in opium. They would scatter into opium dens, stretch their legs and feet, and not care about the time. It was very difficult for the passengers to gather the porters to start the journey again. It seems that these sedan chair porters and opium have become a cyclical relationship. If they don't carry, they have no money for opium; if they don't indulge in opium, they have no strength to carry the sedan chair. It's pitiful, hateful, and beyond salvation. Qiongzhou is an important prefecture in western Sichuan, but it has a heavy burden and weak production, and there is no commercial activity to speak of. Other social conditions were not known in detail due to the hurried overnight stay during the journey. Qiongzhou is famous for its bamboo, which can be used for carving or making canes. According to local elders, it has become extinct due to the devastation of war and the destruction of bamboo shoot eaters. The Qionglai bamboo sold in other ports recently is produced in Yunshan, northern Sichuan and is an imitation. Leaving Qionglai City, the snowy peaks of Maoxian County can be seen in the distance, shining in the sunlight, like white clouds in summer and autumn. It is said that the snow on the Dapailing Mountain is several feet thick. From the foot of the mountain to the peak is 40 li, requiring a day's journey. When one is in this magnificent environment, it is even more sufficient to broaden one's mind. After traveling 80 li, they stayed overnight at a small inn in Baizhang. There is a place name on this road called Heizhuguan, located at the intersection of several counties. It is known as a place where bandits often appear. It was fortunate that the journey was peaceful that day. On the morning of the 21st, they set off from Baizhang and arrived at the county seat of Mingshan at noon. Mengshan Mountain outside the city is famous for its tea, called Mengding Tea, also known as "Water from the Yangtze River, Tea from the Top of Mengshan." From Mingshan, they started at Datangpu. A platoon of soldiers who had been escorting them turned back. The reporter and his party of seven bravely marched forward, passing the Jinjiguan Mountain slope, which was very steep. One man guarding the pass can block ten thousand people. It was said that there were also bandits appearing, but they were able to cross it safely. After passing this pass, the Ya River was in sight. After traveling another 20 li, they arrived at the outskirts of Ya'an, crossed the Ya River on a bamboo raft bridge, entered Ya'an City, climbed Cangping Mountain, and stayed at the private village of Yao Zhongliang, the director of the transportation department of the Sichuan-Kang Border Defense Army. Ya'an was originally a prefectural seat but was recently changed to a county seat. Tea production is the main industry and the only export product to Kang and Tibet. It is suitable for the diet and physical needs of Tibetans. They cannot live without it, otherwise, the butter, mutton, and highland barley in the Tibetan's stomach will cause bloating and death. It is an important commodity in Han-Tibetan trade relations. The climate is rainy. There is a saying that "a light breeze brings rain, and Rongjing is arid." Qingxi was the original name, now changed to Hanxi, because it is at the foot of Jiaoxiang Ridge, so it is windy all day long. Rongjing, like the northern plateau, is also west of Ya'an. Because Xiangling Mountain stands tall, there is little rain all year round. Like a huge wave in the Pacific Ocean, the westward wind is blocked by the lofty Xiangling Mountain, and after changes in air pressure, it rains, just in Ya'an, causing Ya'an to have more rain, Hanyuan to have more wind, and Rongjing to suffer from drought, hence this saying. The reporter, being in this situation, encountered rain every day, and even more believed it to be true. The social and commercial conditions of Ya'an are described in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) Farmland: According to the measurement in the sixth year of the Yongzheng reign (1728), the area of farmland is 70,000 mu plus a fraction, and the area of land is 10,000 mu plus a fraction. (Population): According to the county government's statistics in the twelfth year (1734), there were 33,000 households in the whole county, with a population of 130,000, including 74,000 men and 57,000 women.</p>
<p>(1) Land Tax: The poll tax is over 4,300 taels of silver. Twenty-one years ago (1912), the silver tax was 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(1) Climate: According to the report of the First Agricultural Farm of the Sichuan-Kang Border Area Colonization Command in the 21st year (1932), the temperatures in Fahrenheit are: January 43, February 42, March 62, April 65, July 82, August 78, September 67, October 64, November 60, December 41.</p>
<p>(1) Tea Industry: Statistics on the production of border tea: In the early years of the Republic, 50,000 yin (a unit of weight), each yin containing 5 packets of tea, each packet weighing 20 jin (approximately 10 kilograms), totaling 5,000,000 jin (approximately 2,500 metric tons). In the 12th year of the Republic (1923), 40,000 yin, each yin containing 5 packets of tea, each packet weighing 19 jin, totaling 3,800,000 jin. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), 40,000 piao (another unit), each piao containing 5 packets of tea, each packet weighing 17 jin, totaling 3,400,000 jin. The annual surtax is set at 50,000 piao, and 5,000,000 jin of tea should be handled. The tea that falls short of each piao must be collected and transported from Ebian and Jiading areas.</p>
<p>(1) Fu Tea (Stomach Tea): 50 piao, each piao containing 500 jin of tea, totaling 25,000 jin.</p>
<p>(1) Value of Border Tea: In the early years of the Republic, the market price in Ya'an was 8.0 yuan per piao, with a total value of 400,000 yuan. The price in Kangding was 14 yuan, with a total value of 700,000 yuan. In the 12th year of the Republic (1923), the price in Ya'an was 5.0 yuan, with a total value of 200,000 yuan. The price in Kangding was 14 yuan, with a total value of 560,000 yuan. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the price in Ya'an was 3 yuan, with a total value of 170,000 yuan. The price in Kangding was 14 yuan, with a total value of 560,000 yuan. The price of tea in Ya'an is decreasing day by day, and the income of tea farmers is becoming thinner and thinner. As the tea merchants' tax burden increases day by day, they secretly reduce the quantity of tea leaves in each packet and mix in inferior tea to deceive the barbarians. Therefore, sales are not as prosperous as in the past. The current government has strictly prohibited adulteration and is trying to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>(1) Tea Tax: The tax and surtax on each border tea ticket is 1.7 yuan, and the tax and surtax on each fu tea ticket is 10.0 yuan.</p>
<p>(1) Salt: The annual amount of salt in Ya'an is about 2,600,000 jin. The amount of salt consumed by the people of Ya'an is only 120,000 jin. Assuming an average annual salt consumption of 3 jin per person, the 100,000 adults should consume 300,000 jin. That is, half of the people have no salt to eat.</p>
<p>(1) Cloth: In the early years of the Republic of China, Hubei cloth was used exclusively, known as "Riguang Cloth." At that time, there were more than a dozen cloth shops from Shaanxi. Later, due to high taxes and prices, local cloth from Hongya and Jiajiang rose and seized the market. According to estimates by more than a dozen commercial firms, the value of imports in the early years of the Republic of China was more than 300,000 yuan. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the value of imports was more than 800,000 yuan, and about 100,000 yuan was distributed to the people of Ya'an.</p>
<p>(1) Cloth Tax: A package of local cloth from Hongya and Jiajiang contains 12 pi (a unit of length), and each pi weighs 1 jin. Each package from Hongya to Ya'an was taxed 3 jiao in the 19th year (1930), 5 jiao in the 21st year (1932), and 8 jiao in the 22nd year (1933). The Hongya Customs also includes the anti-communist suppression fee.</p>
<p>(1) Rice: Annual production is about 56,000 shi (a unit of volume).</p>
<p>(1) Corn: Annual production is 50,000 shi. Based on the current population and food consumption, there is a shortage of more than 20,000 shi per year, which is worth more than 300,000 yuan at the current market price. (National News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Lawsuit Regarding the Medicinal Properties of Ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Are the Medicinal Properties Incompatible?</p>
<p>Lawyers Engage in Extensive Debate</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Recently, Wang Shilang, a third-generation doctor in Qingdao, used the traditional Chinese medicine ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum to treat a woman after childbirth. A few days later, the woman died. The woman's family sued the doctor for not knowing the medicinal properties and being negligent of human life. The Qingdao court sentenced him to a fine of 100 yuan. The doctor refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Shandong High Court. Today (the 5th), the debate has concluded, and a date has been set for the verdict. The doctor hired lawyer Zhou Feng to defend him, citing many ancient books, claiming that the two medicines are not contradictory. This case involves the debate on the medicinal properties in our country and is quite interesting. Therefore, the process is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e105">How it Happened <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shilang, a native of Rizhao County, is 46 years old and a third-generation doctor. He currently runs the Kailan Pharmacy at No. 64 Jinxiang Road, Hou Guan, Qingdao, and also practices medicine. On August 21st of last year, Hou Xueyi came to his pharmacy and said that his wife was seriously ill after childbirth and asked him to come for treatment. After Wang went, he saw that the patient, Zhang, Hou's wife, had blood stasis after childbirth, had a severe headache, and was also suffering from an external cold. He was very dangerous, so he followed the ancient prescription Siwu Shenghua Tang, plus ginseng, Feces Trogopterorum, and mustard charcoal to treat her. After taking it, she was still quite safe. Later, due to a quarrel between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the illness worsened. Moreover, the patient took Western medicine aspirin tablets to sweat and ate a lot of watermelon, which aggravated the illness. He also invited Zhang, the director of the Huidong Pharmacy, to check. Zhang said that she had ruptured her water gate after childbirth and performed surgery three times without success. She died at 7 pm on the 26th. The deceased's family was poor and delayed the funeral. Zhao said that the medicine taken by the deceased had contradictory ingredients. Hou Xueyi, the husband of the deceased, and Hou Liu, his mother, suspected that the doctor Wang Shilang had used the wrong medicine, causing the death. They filed a negotiation with Dr. Wang. The two sides held their own opinions and could not resolve it. Hou Liu filed a lawsuit in the local court, requesting a judgment according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Prosecution in Court <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After Hou Liu filed the lawsuit, the prosecutor examined the body and found that she died of illness, and the case was dismissed. Hou Liu filed another lawsuit. Prosecutor Mi Xian conducted a detailed investigation and asked You Xiaoting to testify in court. He also sent a letter to the Social Bureau to ask a Chinese medicine doctor to identify the prescription, believing that it had no monarch-minister-assistant-guide composition, had shallow knowledge, and misused ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum, causing the death of the person. He should be prosecuted for the crime under Article 290, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After being tried by Judge Liu Zhenhan, the debate ended, and he was sentenced to a fine of 100 yuan according to law. If the fine is converted into imprisonment, it will be calculated at 0.2 yuan per day according to Article 55, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Before the judgment is finalized, he will not be detained and there is no need to notify him of the discount. That is, the judgment was made in accordance with Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and the appeal conference was designated as the Shandong High Court, with a deadline of ten days, after which it would be invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Appeal <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After the verdict was pronounced, the defendant Wang Shilang refused to accept the verdict of guilt of causing death due to negligence in business and hired lawyer Zhou Feng in Jinan to file an appeal to the High Court, requesting a retrial. The reasons he held were four: (1) The combination of ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum is the only main medicine following an ancient prescription for treating blood stasis after childbirth. There is evidence from Lei Gong's Materia Medica and the Compendium of Materia Medica and the cases of famous scholars. These books and cases all say that ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum treat the disease, and they are feared but not feared. If there is a disease, there must be a medicine for it. Treating from the opposite direction, each has its own considerations. The blood stasis after childbirth cannot be opened without Feces Trogopterorum. However, at that time, the Qi is extremely weak, and it cannot be consolidated without the great strength of ginseng. Even if it is truly feared, it is only that ginseng is useless in the medicine. How can it be said that it is inappropriate? (2) The original trial said that the illness worsened after taking the medicine, which was a one-sided slander by Hou Liu and cannot be adopted. Neighbors and You Xiaoting should be investigated. You Xiaoting also said in the original trial that Feces Trogopterorum is feared but not feared, and this medicine should be used to treat this disease. Hou Xueyi said that the prescription was criticized by Zhao, but he was repeatedly summoned to court. You Xiaoting testified in court that the medicine was right for her disease, and there are records to prove it. (3) The prescription should be identified by a responsible doctor with high moral character and rich knowledge. If there is any disagreement, it must be debated in court. The case said that the appraiser said that the prescription has no monarch-minister-assistant-guide composition, which is even more unfounded. The angelica, chuanxiong, black ginger, and peach kernels in the prescription are the monarch, as well as donkey-hide gelatin are the assistant, the ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum are the guide, mustard is the minister, licorice harmonizes the ingredients, and everyone is considered. Without investigating the condition, it cannot be said that the medicine is not right. What's more, the condition and the medicine are perfectly matched? (4) For Hou Zhang's illness, the hospital must be investigated, and President Zhang and his female doctor from Huidong Pharmacy must be summoned. However, President Zhang was not asked, and the valueless words of You Xiaoting were believed, which is unreasonable. In addition, there are four pieces of irrefutable evidence. The appeal is for the court to determine innocence.</p>
<h3 id="e108">End of Debate <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the application, the High Court held a hearing at 9 am on the 5th by Gao Xiansuo, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division. Lawyer Zhou Feng defended the defendant, saying that whether the defendant Wang Shilang committed the crime of causing death due to negligence depends on whether the ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum in the prescription are contradictory medicines, and whether the combination of the two can cause death. According to the Compendium of Materia Medica, in the section of mutually reinforcing, mutually dependent, mutually fearing, and mutually antagonizing medicines in the preface and the lower part, ginseng is listed as fearing Feces Trogopterorum, and Feces Trogopterorum is listed as hating ginseng. However, the 36 kinds of medicines listed in the contradictory medicines section do not include these two ingredients. This is irrefutable evidence that they are not contradictory. Furthermore, in the Compendium of Materia Medica, in the section on mountain herbs, the annotation of ginseng says that ancient prescriptions used Siwu Tang to treat closed menstruation, adding ginseng and Feces Trogopterorum, which means fearing but not fearing. Since ginseng fears but does not fear Feces Trogopterorum, Feces Trogopterorum also hates but does not hate ginseng. The combination of these two ingredients will not cause death. This is also irrefutable evidence. Also, in Yan Chunxi's "Methods for Childbirth and Postpartum," and Zhang Shiwan's "Medical Understanding of Postpartum," all cases of fever, headache, and abdominal pain after childbirth are treated with Sheng Hua Tang with modifications. If the patient has been ill for a long time and is weak, ginseng is added. If the pain does not stop, Feces Trogopterorum is added. If there are other symptoms, other medicines are added. Hou Zhang's illness was blood stasis after childbirth combined with wind and cold, causing fever, headache, and abdominal pain, and had been going on for 20 days, making her body weak. The defendant prescribed Sheng Hua Tang plus ginseng, Feces Trogopterorum, mustard, charcoal, and other ingredients, which was based on the established methods in various books and was the right medicine for the symptoms. Where is the mistake? This is also irrefutable evidence. Furthermore, Zhang, the president of Huidong Pharmacy, a Western doctor in Qingdao, diagnosed the disease as poor delivery during childbirth, tearing the small intestine and water gate, which is called "drawing intestinal wind." The defendant is a Chinese medicine doctor and has no surgical examination for this type of disease. However, since it is said that the small intestine and water gate are torn, there must be swelling, injury, and blood stasis at the torn area. Then, the defendant's Sheng Hua Tang with added ingredients for promoting blood circulation is also correct for this type of disease. This is also irrefutable evidence. Based on the above irrefutable evidence, combined with the patient's condition at that time, the patient's death was caused by poor delivery during childbirth, and by eating watermelon and taking aspirin arbitrarily after taking the medicine to cause sweating and aggravate the weakness, rather than by taking the defendant's prescription. The reasons are clear and understandable. At 11 o'clock, President Gao announced the end of the debate and adjourned the court for sentencing. (5th)</p>

<p>Actively Promoting After Restructuring</p>
<p>The Farmers' Bank of Jiangsu Province has been established for five years. Over the years, the business has progressed. The current paid-in capital has reached 1.6 million yuan, and there are 24 branches. It is an important bank in our country for rescuing the rural economy and is highly valued by all parties. Since the provincial government appointed Zhao Dihua as the general manager, in order to seek to expand the practical effects of relieving farmers, he has strived to develop and reform the bank's affairs. The reporter, considering that the bank is particularly important at a time when the rural economy is declining, paid a special visit to the authorities, and he was informed of the recent handling situation, which is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Since January of this year, in order to concentrate resources and facilitate the allocation of funds, the bank has abolished the regional jurisdiction system and switched to the head office business. As a result, the business has become more developed than before. The achievements of the bank's "lending," "depositing," and "collecting" activities were compared between the total number in January of this year and the average number from July to the end of December of the previous year. "Lending" increased by about 25%, "ordinary deposits" increased by about 19%, and "savings deposits" increased by about 17%. A total of deposits increased by 450,000 yuan within a month, and "collection" decreased by 8%. In order to actually develop the farmers' economy, increase its own strength, and facilitate the financing of production, transportation, and other cooperative societies, the bank is actively promoting farmers' savings and the implementation of rural town remittance. At the same time, the bank felt that the business center of the province is organized farmers, that is, cooperative societies, but cooperative societies in Jiangsu Province often only have a nominal existence and lack practical effects. Therefore, it actively promotes rectification so that cooperative societies can also engage in production, transportation, sales, purchasing, utilization, and other businesses, which is sufficient to actually increase agricultural production. Recently, the bank also established a "Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Agricultural Products Marketing Office" in Nanshi, Shanghai. Its task is to act as an agent for cooperatives or farmers in transporting and selling agricultural products and purchasing fertilizers, seeds, and other necessities. It has already begun to accept commissions from cooperatives in various places, and the work is extremely busy. Through this promotion, the bank can solve the entire process from sowing to product sales for farmers. This can actually promote agricultural production. The bank's new plan can be fully implemented this year, and the agricultural economy in Jiangsu Province will have considerable results.</p>

<p>The Dispute over the West City Vegetable Market Continues: Hong Yongkun, a merchant who collects taxes in the West Liku vegetable market in Yangyu Lane in the west of the city, had a major dispute with the vendors over donations. It has lasted for four months and has not been resolved. Now, Hong Yongkun has specially hired lawyer Zhu Chengyue and submitted a presentation to the county government yesterday (7th), requesting the enforcement of the treaty in accordance with the law and ordering all vendors to move into the vegetable market. However, the county government is quite hesitant about this matter because of the firm attitude of the vendors.</p>

<p>Gu Afu, a villager in Huangnibang, located at the junction of Jiaozhi Township and Su Kun, is a well-to-do family, which attracted the attention of bandits. Around 1 am yesterday (7th), more than a dozen bandits from the Kunshan area, speaking in the Jiangbei accent, broke into the house and dragged the victim out of the bed, forcing him to tell the location of the hidden silver. As a result, silver dollars, field deeds, and other items worth about a thousand yuan were robbed. Gu Afu's thigh was also injured by the bandits with a gun handle.</p>

<p>Playing with Dragon Lanterns Almost Caused a Disaster</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the lunar new year, flower drum operas, dragon lanterns, and large gambling venues have become increasingly popular in our county. Because the authorities did not investigate and prohibit them, people in society have been complaining. Around 9 pm the day before yesterday, dragon lanterns from Yutian Wang Temple and other places were playing in the streets. When they arrived at the flower drum opera venue opened by Shao Zengfu on Xinji River, they played dragon lanterns by beating gongs and drums. Shao Zengfu, the owner of the venue, thought that the gongs and drums were shaking the sky and interfering with the order of the venue, so he stepped forward to stop them, but it was ineffective and took away the gong. This aroused public anger and they carried the dragon lanterns into the venue and played them, smashing 20 teapots. The order was suddenly chaotic, and the general audience fled in all directions. Doors and windows were crushed. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau received the news early and immediately ordered the squad leader to take the police to the venue to suppress them, so that no major disaster occurred.</p>

<p>Fushan Pond in our county is an important passage to the Yangtze River. Later, due to the influx of tides, silt accumulated over the years. In addition, there has been a drought recently, and the river water is shallow and only two feet deep, making it difficult for ships to pass through. The Dredging Committee has decided and dredged it. Now, Hu Zhenkang, the chief of the twelfth district, has been appointed as the director, and Jin Ping, the chief of the eighth district, and Cheng Zhaoxiang, the chief of the first district, have been appointed as the deputy directors. After building a dam on the 10th of this month, construction will begin.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wuxi Small Car Owners Call for Relief <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Xiyi Provincial Road has been completed and is scheduled to hold a opening ceremony in Wuxi on the 10th of this month. Jiangnan Automobile Company has signed an exclusive operating right agreement with the Construction Department. After the road is open to traffic, the company will collect road maintenance donations for all small cars traveling on the Xiyi Road. Two yuan will be charged for each round trip between Wuxi and Yixing. Small car companies heard this news that the fares set by long-distance buses are only one cent per Chinese li, so the single fare from Wuxi to Yixing is only 1.1 yuan, and the fare from Wuxi to Meiyuan is only two jiao. The selling price is extremely cheap, and the tax collection is extremely heavy. Small car companies will inevitably perish. The small car companies specially appointed representatives to request relief from the Construction Bureau and put forward three points: (1) Please reduce the road maintenance donation on Xiyi Road to 1 yuan. (2) Small cars are allowed to carry passengers from Yixing back to Wuxi. (3) The Jiangnan long-distance bus must not set up stops and sell tickets in Meiyuan. Zhang Dezai, the director of the Construction Bureau, agreed to contact Jiangnan Automobile Company to discuss the plan.</p>

<p>Dashuxia Jiangyin Lane is a bustling market in the northern district, with shops lined up. Yesterday (the 7th) morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the rattan shop next to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. At that time, the northeast wind was strong, and it was also midnight. The fire was fierce and quickly spread, burning four shops, including Xinshengxing Flower and Firecracker Shop and Grocery Store, across the street (and the house of resident Wang Yaoxi was also completely burned). A total of more than 20 houses were burned, and the loss was extremely heavy. After the fire broke out in the rattan shop, there was no back door, resulting in the burning of six men, women, and children, and two seriously injured. Fortunately, the Farmers' Bank was next door and was able to provide rescue, so it was not affected, which was a fortunate thing.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Dispute over the Opening of Xiyi Road <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Jiangnan Automobile Company previously signed a contract with the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department to exclusively operate on the Xiyi Provincial Road and was scheduled to hold a opening ceremony on the 10th of this month and officially open to traffic on the 11th. The company has also determined the fare and other information, which has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the company also stipulates that ordinary business small cars must pay a road maintenance donation of 2 yuan per trip to Yixing. If they start from Guanxing and drive to Wuxi, they cannot carry passengers and can only return empty to avoid hindering the company's business. After hearing the news, the small car companies felt that the burden was too heavy, and the business would be completely deprived. The restriction on carrying passengers on the return trip would put the small cars to death. The fare set by Jiangnan Company is also too profitable, and the small cars will have no way to survive. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, representatives such as Cao Xuemei and Yang Zhiguang and more than a dozen others went to the County Construction Bureau with a document to petition for relief. Zhang Dezai, the director of the bureau, personally met with them. The representatives explained their business difficulties and requested (1) that the road maintenance donation on the Xiyi Road be reduced to 1 yuan per trip, (2) that passengers be allowed to be transported from Yixing back to Wuxi, (3) that the Jiangnan Automobile be allowed to stop and sell tickets from Wuxi Station to Meiyuan so that tourists can take small cars. Director Zhang agreed to contact Jiangnan Company and then discuss relief measures. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>The house of Shi Mingke in Dapi Lane in the city was robbed of 700 silver dollars by seven bandits on the evening of the 22nd of last month. After the county magistrate and the Public Security Bureau cooperated in the search, Huang Bingzhong, the leader of the detective team, obtained the name of Huang Yanchen, a suspect in the case. Huang Yanchen was formerly an associate in the Fengtaiyuan Money Shop and had a kinship with the Shi family. He also obtained clues and sent personnel to Shanghai. Zhao Pengling, who once served as a reporter for the newspaper, an associate of Xieshengzhuang, and a broker at the Chinese Cloth Exchange, was captured in the Chujiang Bridge in the French Concession and was sent to Cheng on the 6th. In the afternoon, at 6 o'clock, Shi Chengshen examined the case, and Zhao confessed to many accomplices, claiming that he was young and deceived by others, and only got 51 yuan. After the interrogation, he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang County Tobacco Industry Occupational Union previously reported that its members Zhao Ruanlu and others were dismissed by Zhu Rongzhi, the owner of Ruihe Company, without any reason. The laid-off workers immediately reported to the union and requested the party and government organs to mediate.

In order to cooperate, the employer may order union members in each store to take turns drawing shifts when business is slow. 3. All laid-off workers are scheduled to work at the store on March 15th. Both parties agreed, and a dispute was resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e119">&lt;Motives for Coming to China P] Yesterday at 10:30 AM, Mr. Hawke met with Chinese and foreign reporters inside the Shanghai office of the Curtiss-Wright Airplane Company in the Hamilton House. Mr. Hawke first stated his motives for coming, saying he came at the invitation of Mr. Pauly, the company's representative in Shanghai, specifically to perform a technical demonstration to arouse the interest of Chinese people in aviation. He also said that he would go to Hangzhou tomorrow (i.e., today). After the aircraft is fully assembled in two or three weeks, he will fly the plane to Shanghai to perform, and then go to Beijing and other places. <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<h3 id="e120">Aircraft Construction Hawke continued to talk about the construction of the "Condor" aircraft. The aircraft is 45 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 21 feet high, with 16 seats and 10 rescue beds for medical assistance. Its maximum speed can reach 180 miles per hour. This time, due to the large size of the fuselage, it was divided into five large boxes. It is scheduled to be transported to Jianqiao, Hangzhou, tomorrow (i.e., today), where it will be assembled by pilot Mr. Gars. It will take about two to three weeks to complete the assembly. If this aircraft is used for military transportation, it can carry 24 to 30 soldiers each time. If it is used for rescue, it can become a mobile hospital, rescuing wounded soldiers, etc., and can carry 10 to 12 people in extreme comfort. <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<h3 id="e121">Military Equipment The aircraft is a military aircraft. In addition to the rescue beds, it is equipped with a machine gun in the front, and one machine gun each at the top and bottom near the tail. They can fire in all directions. In addition, the aircraft can carry 4,000 pounds of bombs. Each wing can carry nine 100-pound bombs, and the front can carry two large 1,100-pound bombs. The aircraft is equipped with a bomb sight, so that the bombs can be dropped directly to the destination. The upper and lower parts of the aircraft each store 300 gallons of gasoline. The head of the aircraft has instruments and blind flying equipment, as well as landing lights for night, and the bomb sight is installed at the rear. Then, the large-sized engines are installed on both sides. If it is used to transport 18 passengers, it can carry 20 to 30 people if they are of short stature. <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<h3 id="e122">Breaking Records Mr. Hawke is about 40 years old, with a short stature and strong physique. There are scars on the upper right corner of his head and on the side of his nose, which are the results of injuries sustained while flying. According to reports, Mr. Hawke once created a new record on Texaco No. 30 aircraft in the United States. After breaking other people's records, Mr. Hawke also flew to Europe on the same aircraft and set a new speed record. This record is still held by Mr. Hawke today and has not been broken by others. After Mr. Hawke returned to the United States from Europe, he flew from Los Angeles to New York in twelve hours and twenty-five minutes, setting another new record. This record broke his own record set seven days earlier from Los Angeles to New York. <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

<p>The New Sound Society said that the International Problems Research Association of this port believes that war clouds are gathering between Japan and Russia, and there is a high possibility of an outbreak. If it breaks out, both countries will want to use China's raw materials and manpower. Will China be used by Soviet Russia or by Japan? Or can China take advantage of the opportunity and seek its own interests? China's diplomacy has always been passive diplomacy and has never been active diplomacy. This is all because there is no research or preparation beforehand. If we still do not research or prepare now, we will still be used by other countries after the war breaks out and suffer great losses, as in the previous Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the research association was specially convened the day before yesterday, and Mr. Xia Jinlin was invited to lead the research on this matter. However, researching this major issue cannot be completed by holding a few meetings. It is necessary to extensively search for books and newspapers from various countries and invite experts to carefully study them, and then hold meetings to discuss everyone's research results. It will take some time to achieve considerable results. After discussion by the members, it was decided to submit the case to the board of directors to discuss specific measures to engage in practical research, which is currently underway. In addition, since January of this year, the association has published a "Newsletter" booklet, which publishes association affairs and selects important international news and English commentary. It is sent to members and overseas Chinese national diplomacy associations to communicate information. The January newsletter has already been sent out, and the February issue will also be published.

<h3 id="e125">Kong Xiangrong Elaborates on the Yellow River Disaster Relief Work All Projects in Three Provinces Expected to Be Completed by the End of Next Month <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the disaster relief work of the Yellow River Water Disaster Committee, yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Kong Xiangrong, the director of the disaster relief work group of the committee. According to him, the Yellow River disaster relief work in the three provinces will be fully completed by the end of next month. Mr. Kong took the night train to Beijing last night to meet with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and planned to visit the disaster area again for inspection. The details of his talk are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e126">All Projects to Be Completed Next Month According to Mr. Kong, the disaster relief work in the first district (i.e., Henan) and the third district (i.e., Shandong) of the Yellow River disaster area has been fully completed one after another. However, the disaster relief work in the second district (i.e., Hebei) is still in progress. Because the breach in this district is relatively large, it is difficult to block, and the lack of materials such as bricks and stones makes the work particularly difficult. However, this work cannot be delayed, so materials have been ordered from various places and will be concentrated in the Shijiazhuang area within 20 days, and then the blocking will continue, with the goal of completely completing all projects in the three provinces by the end of next month. <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<h3 id="e127">Materials for Blocking Breaches Arrive Mr. Kong continued to say that the breach in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, is relatively large, and the blocking work is naturally difficult. The work of hiring laborers to block the breach has already completed most of it. The breach-blocking project is not at the Shuikoumen, but in the villages on the high ground inside the Shuikoumen. A dike 25 meters high has been built, but this height is still not enough to stop the high floodwaters of the Yellow River, so it has been decided to continue to raise it by 10 meters. However, due to the lack of materials, it is estimated that another 3,500 cubic meters of stone, 100,000 bricks, 1.9 million sacks, 40 tons of steel wire, and 200 iron anchors are needed. But there is not much in stock at the front, so we have to wait for the materials to be transported before continuing. Yesterday, a telegram arrived in Shanghai stating that 500 cubic meters of large stones had been transported to Shijiazhuang, and a large batch of materials could be completely concentrated at Lanfeng Station within days, so I have telegraphed the local staff to quickly increase the number of vehicles and shifts from Lanfeng to Shijiazhuang to facilitate transportation. As for the breach-blocking work, when I went to inspect it, I gave instructions in person that blocking the breach should not wait for the water to recede, but should be carried out during the rising tide, which can use the water power to increase the working force. Therefore, I have telegraphed the upstream water affairs agencies that when the upstream water rises, they should immediately notify Shijiazhuang and other places by urgent telegram, and then calculate the time to start working, which will be easier. <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<h3 id="e128">Proposed Measures Approved by the Executive Yuan The Yellow River disaster has occurred frequently and is not uncommon. It has occurred almost every few years in recent years, and the people on both sides of the river who have been victimized are countless. Therefore, fundamental relief is necessary to achieve success. I have reported the situation to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and proposed three measures: (1) Add a Yellow River disaster relief fee to railway passenger tickets in Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces; (2) Stipulate Yellow River disaster relief funds in the three provinces; (3) Request the National Economic Council to allocate funds from the American cotton and wheat loan funds. The above three measures have been formally approved by the Executive Yuan meeting. <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<h3 id="e129">Yesterday Returned to the Construction Site to Direct the Work After briefly arranging important group affairs in Shanghai, Director Kong took the night train to Beijing last night and then went to the Changyuan construction site to direct the work. I found a copy of his telegram to the two supervisors Yu and Shao of the Supervisory Yuan, and the engineering bureau, which is attached below. "To the two Supervisors Yu and Shao in Kaifeng, and Engineer Song of the Engineering Office and Director Sun: I have been in internal meetings four times and traveled between Beijing and Shanghai every day without stopping. Fortunately, the three methods for raising 14 million yuan for the post-disaster water control project in the three provinces have been submitted by this committee to the Executive Yuan for submission to the administrative meeting, which was passed yesterday, and a letter has been sent to the National Economic Commission. I will hear the details with attention. Also, Rong came to Shanghai this morning to withdraw money and remit it to Bian, and will return to the construction site by night train, and plans to go to Lanfeng and Zhengzhou to urge the transportation of stone materials, and discuss the matter of adding trains on the Longhai Railway. A method for raising funds for the Hebei project has been agreed upon, and funds for repairing the embankment in Shijiazhuang are available. I especially inform Director Sun of this news for his comfort. Chairman Liu also telegraphed Rong to borrow funds for construction projects, or to stay in Beijing for half a day to visit Minister Kong to discuss matters. As for the finalization of the construction method for the closure, I think that Engineer Song has discussed it with Directors Sun and Yang. When Rong returns to the construction site, he will convene an engineering meeting, and when the materials are ready, he must seize the opportunity to rush to block the breach to achieve success. Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group, Yang." <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<h3 id="e130">National Goods Shipped to Sichuan Dispute British Ships Can Sail to Wanxian The Painful History of the Past Massacre Will Disappear Invisibly Today <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The rise in water levels in the Sichuan River has caused opposition from foreign cargo handlers, who have unanimously stopped loading domestic goods into Sichuan and have also negotiated with the shipping company authorities. Now the freight rates for shipping domestic goods to Sichuan have been reduced, but the Hakka merchants are still dissatisfied and will promote the resumption of Japanese ships. The long-unresolved Wanxian Massacre will disappear invisibly in this price increase dispute, which is why the people of Sichuan are very dissatisfied. The latest news is detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Hakka Merchants Continue to Negotiate Foreign cargo handlers, because the freight rates set by various shipping companies on the Sichuan River are too high, have decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to suppress this unreasonable price. This price increase is entirely based on the people's livelihood, so the Hakka merchants continue to negotiate with the Minsheng Shipping Company. The Minsheng Shipping Company authorities, in view of the breakdown of the merchants' demands, also deeply know that the pricing was not carefully graded. They are afraid that a prolonged strike will hurt both sides, so the company took the initiative to make concessions and agreed to the foreign cargo handlers' request to reduce freight rates. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<h3 id="e132">Reduce Freight Rates for Domestic Goods Li, a representative of the Minsheng Shipping Company, convened representatives of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Jiejang, and other companies at the Jiejang Company the day before yesterday for another meeting to discuss freight rates for shipping domestic goods to Sichuan and agreed to reduce them. The result of the discussion was that all foreign goods, originally priced at 80 yuan per ton, would be reduced by 10 yuan and charged only 70 yuan. The foreign cargo handlers, after receiving the news, also convened a meeting of their members and decided that the reduction was too small. The merchants decided that each ton of foreign goods would only be charged 30 yuan for freight. If the shipping company does not agree, they can add another 10 yuan, so that both parties have not reached a satisfactory resolution. <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<h3 id="e133">Stop Shipping and Wait for Opportunities This matter has been under negotiation for several days, and there is still no definite solution. The Hakka merchants are now in the process of stopping the shipment of goods and have decided to take a wait-and-see attitude until the shipping bureau can sympathize. The water level in the Sichuan River is rising daily, and Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai are indeed planning to resume Sichuan River liner services. At the latest, in three weeks, Japanese ships can resume sailing to Chongqing. At that time, loading on Japanese ships will definitely get extremely low freight rates, so that the cost of goods shipped can be reduced by half compared to the current loading. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<h3 id="e134">Wanxian Massacre Disappears Wanxian produces a large amount of tung oil every year, which is usually shipped to Shanghai by foreign merchant ships and then transferred to the United States. Since the Wanxian Massacre, British merchant ships such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have not been allowed to sail there. The goods from Wanxian have been obtained by our Chinese merchant ships. British merchants have repeatedly discussed resuming navigation with the Sichuan authorities, but they have not sympathized. This time, Minsheng and others advocated an alliance and allowed British ships to share the cargo transportation in Wanxian, which not only broke the exclusive business of Chinese merchant ships, but also caused the results of the Wanxian Massacre to disappear invisibly. After the implementation of this alliance treaty, British ships have achieved a great victory and are very satisfied. However, a certain shipping company in this port received a telegram from Sichuan stating that when this news reached Sichuan, the people of Sichuan were very dissatisfied. <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<h3 id="e135">Post and Telegraph Bureaus Merged to Operate from the 15th Expenditures After the Merger Must Not Exceed the Original Number <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in order to save expenses, facilitate the public, and increase transportation efficiency, the Ministry of Communications has issued an order to merge all post and telegraph bureaus below the third class. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces will be the first to pilot this. After observing the results, it will be extended to other regions. According to Zhu Menghou, director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Administration, the issue of merging post and telegraph bureaus below the third class has now been decided and will be piloted in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces starting on March 15th. Before the merger is implemented, it is still necessary to investigate what difficulties there may be in the merger, whether the lease contracts for the buildings have expired, and what troubles there may be in terminating the contracts. If there are no difficulties, the merger will be implemented on March 5th. For areas with difficulties, the merger will be implemented after the difficulties are resolved. The only principle of the post and telegraph merger is that the expenditures after the merger must not exceed the original number before the merger. As for the administration and business of other post and telegraph bureaus after the merger, they will remain independent and will not be merged.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Citizens Write to Mayor Wu to Express Their Opinions on Rent Reduction The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, Eleventh District Branch, and Wuma Road Rent Reduction Branch, sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating that since the January 28th Incident, the market has been in a slump. Even prosperous areas have become depressed. Shops are closing one after another, and courts are sealing up properties frequently. Among them, many are due to the bleakness of life and the inability to make ends meet, but even more are due to high rents and losses outweighing gains. The large number of court-ordered pre-seizures due to rent arrears is clear evidence of this. Big hotels, dance halls, cinemas, and brothels are places for the wealthy to indulge in, and in Shanghai, a place of extravagance and decadence, people want to spend limited money in unlimited places, so there are times when turnover is not smooth. The only way out is to increase rent. Although this is not a common problem among all landlords, some landlords are like this. At this difficult time, if we do not work together in harmony to remedy the situation, the collapse will be inevitable. If you look at the closed and sealed houses in the downtown area, there are few inquiries, which is another obvious fact. The association has seen this in its limited perspective and holds concerns. All members have repeatedly stated their hardships due to the close relationship of their interests. After careful consideration, the only way is to ask your Excellency to express your opinion on rent reduction, so that the standards can be set and there can be a basis for resolving disputes between landlords and tenants and stabilizing people's hearts. Social security will benefit from this. <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>

<p>Chinese tung oil is of good quality and is highly praised by paint manufacturers in Europe and America. Therefore, foreign trade has improved in recent years. According to a survey by the International Trade Bureau, since the founding of the Republic of China, annual exports have increased from 400,000 piculs to more than 1 million piculs, valued at 405,701,269 yuan. The total exports for each year are recorded as follows: Year 1: 582,815 piculs, valued at 8,734,806 yuan; Year 2: 463,647 piculs, valued at 6,002,254 yuan; Year 3: 438,867 piculs, valued at 5,604,412 yuan; Year 4: 31,344 piculs, valued at 4,518,514 yuan; Year 5: 515,173 piculs, valued at 8,267,127 yuan; Year 6: 401,361 piculs, valued at 7,258,862 yuan; Year 7: 488,852 piculs, valued at 8,963,889 yuan; Year 8: 613,455 piculs, valued at 11,941,452 yuan; Year 9: 540,716 piculs, valued at 10,105,787 yuan; Year 10: 419,549 piculs, valued at 8,199,645 yuan; Year 11: 745,565 piculs, valued at 16,332,195 yuan; Year 12: 836,897 piculs, valued at 26,216,130 yuan; Year 13: 896,038 piculs, valued at 26,572,070 yuan; Year 14: 894,03 piculs, valued at 26,173,156 yuan; Year 15: 748,184 piculs, valued at 22,443,470 yuan; Year 16: 910,294 piculs, valued at 32,956,421 yuan; Year 17: 1,094,299 piculs, valued at 34,953,332 yuan; Year 18: 1,069,650 piculs, valued at 35,279,553 yuan; Year 19: 1,167,255 piculs, valued at 45,820,208 yuan; Year 20: 818,874 piculs, valued at 28,362,075 yuan; Year 21: 802,769 piculs, valued at 22,299,005 yuan; Year 22: 582,815 piculs, valued at 8,734,806 yuan.

<h3 id="e138">New Telephones Installed at the North Railway Station The original telephone exchange at the Shanghai North Railway Station was destroyed in the January 28th Incident two years ago. Later, to facilitate public affairs, 14 telephones from the American Shanghai Telephone Company were installed at the North Railway Station, the North Locomotive Depot, the McLean Road Station, and the Wusong Machine Factory. However, the efficiency was low and the cost was high, which was uneconomical. Therefore, a plan to install a full set of exchange equipment was submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. 8,100 yuan was paid to Siemens Electric Factory to sign a contract to undertake the work. It is planned to install 10 pairs of trunk lines in the North Railway Station area, one exchange, one switchboard at the North Railway Station information desk, 28 extensions, 16 extensions in the North Locomotive Factory area, 4 extensions in the McLean Road Station area, one exchange in the Wusong Machine Factory, and 13 extensions. The system was put into use on March 1st. Since the installation of this exchange, the monthly recurring expenses are no more than 600 yuan (that is, even if it is expanded to 80 extensions in the future, it will only be 600 yuan), which is 500 yuan less than the previous 1,100 yuan spent monthly for only 14 extensions. This saves about 6,000 yuan per year. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>

<h3 id="e139">Municipal Authorities Plan the City's Traffic Network, Starting with South Shanghai Central News Agency reports that the South Shanghai Bus Company, affected by the January 28th Incident, suffered excessive losses and was unable to maintain operations, declaring liquidation. However, since the ceasefire in South Shanghai, the city has become more prosperous than before. The municipal authorities then planned to organize a municipal transportation network, but at that time, due to economic difficulties, it was impossible to proceed. It is reported that the Municipal Public Works Bureau has recently implemented a loan with the foreign company "Asia Development," starting with South Shanghai first, and then extending to the entire city. The detailed information is recorded as follows. <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<h3 id="e140">Land and Water Routes The transportation network planned by the municipal authorities was originally to be carried out on both land and water routes. In terms of waterways, it has been carefully managed by Tan Boying, director of the ferry management office of the Xingye Trust Company, and it is now quite large in scale. As for land routes, after the closure of the South Shanghai Bus Company, the Municipal Public Works Bureau planned to take it over and operate it, starting with South Shanghai first, and then connecting it to West Shanghai and North Shanghai. This plan was ultimately unable to be realized early due to limited funding. <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<h3 id="e141">Negotiating Loans The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the suspension of the South Shanghai Bus Company was mostly due to the mismanagement of the operators, so it has repeatedly petitioned the municipal government to take it over and operate it. The municipal government once handed it over to the Finance Bureau, etc., to review and sign opinions, but the municipal treasury was severely strained due to the impact of the January 28th Incident. The Municipal Public Works Bureau's plan could not be realized, so Director Xu Peihuang negotiated a loan with the foreign company Asia Development, which was still to be operated by the bureau. The company agreed that all vehicles would be supplied by the company, and the company would operate on the circular road around the city and the route from West Gate to Longhua. After about three years, the loan would be repaid annually from the surplus. <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<h3 id="e142">Starting Preparations After the Municipal Public Works Bureau signed the loan contract with Asia Development, it began preparations. The bureau has submitted to the municipal government for approval to establish the South Shanghai Bus Management Office, with Zhang Dengyi, chief of the fourth section of the bureau, concurrently serving as director, and Jin Baoxian, director of the accounting section of the first section of the bureau, concurrently serving as deputy director. The office is also divided into three sections: technology, business, and general affairs, each with a section chief. The technology section is concurrently headed by Qin Zhihui, a technician of the bureau, the business section is concurrently headed by Deputy Director Jin, and the general affairs section is headed by Zhang Fufeng, chief of the general affairs section of the first section of the bureau. The organization has been established, and it can be operated on a selected date after the Asia Development Company delivers the buses. <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<h3 id="e143">Labor Dispute at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section of the Two Railways Resolved The Railway Bureau Electrically Replies to Each Station The Annual Salary Increase for the Second Half of the 22nd Year The General Bureau Has Reviewed and Will Announce It Soon <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou section branch office of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Workers' Union convened a temporary delegates' meeting at the Jiaxing office due to issues such as annual salary increases and passed 11 resolutions, requesting the two railways unions to make demands to the two railway bureaus and set a deadline of three days (last Saturday) for a reply. After receiving the news, the railway bureau selectively replied electrically to each station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, ignoring the workers' union. Therefore, the workers' union believed that the railway bureau's reply procedure was inappropriate. After convening a management meeting for three days, it reasoned with the railway bureau and extended the deadline to three days, requesting the bureau to reply. At that time, the situation was very serious. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency learned from the railway bureau's staff that, as of yesterday, Xiao Weiguo, director of the bureau's transportation department, had once gone to Hangzhou to convene a sectional affairs meeting to discuss the solution to the matter and convened Jiaxing branch office staff to explain in detail. It is learned that yesterday the railway bureau had replied to each request separately. The details of the process are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Employee Requirements (1) Clearly announce the specific methods for determining annual salary increases and performance appraisals.

(10) Train conductors Tao Yong and Zheng Guoliang have been promoted and should be given a salary increase according to precedent. (11) In October of the 21st year, train No. 408 did not exchange a road sign when passing Wangdian Station.

<p>According to the Ministry of Communications' official telegram, starting from March 15th of this year, postage for postal transfer of telegrams should be waived. Starting from that date, each bureau should handle postal transfer of telegrams according to the following methods: (1) Charge according to the domestic telegram rates, postage is waived. (2) When handing over for postal delivery, the telegram should be placed in a visible-envelope postal transfer telecommunications envelope. If there is no such envelope, a regular telegram envelope may be used temporarily, stating the name and address of the recipient, and adding the postal affairs stamp and the name stamp of the handler. No postage stamps should be affixed. Use a telegram delivery book to clearly indicate the date, number, telegram type, number of words, and the place of dispatch and receipt, and submit it to the local post office or agency for inspection and receipt. Then, the postal stamp should be affixed in the telegram delivery book, and no receipt should be given. Seal the envelope and deliver it to the recipient.

<h3 id="e149">Inventory of the Palace Museum's Antiquities Not Held Today Because the Central Government's Representatives Have Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Office of the Palace Museum, the inspection was originally scheduled to start today (the 8th). However, because the special commissioner appointed by the Central Government has not yet arrived in Shanghai, it cannot be held as scheduled. It is currently impossible to determine when it can begin. It is expected to start after the representatives appointed by the Central Government arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Reaction to the Increased Commission in the Wuxi-Changzhou Grain Industry The commission for selling grain in Wuxi and Changzhou was generally converted at a 1% discount, which was the same as in Shanghai. After the lunar new year, the grain industry in Wuxi suddenly united with their counterparts in Changzhou, citing the rising cost of living, and changed to a 1.6% discount. Farmers and merchants in the northern Anhui production areas believed that grain prices had fallen to an extreme point, and they were on the verge of bankruptcy. The further increase in commission by Wuxi and Changzhou was unbearable. They jointly elected representatives Sun Yuanfu, Li Peisheng, and Hu Hanqing to go south for negotiations and submitted a petition to the competent authorities. It is heard that the result of the petition was satisfactory. At a time when the sound of economic depression is filling the air and farmers and merchants across the country are in distress, the sudden increase in commission by the Wuxi and Changzhou grain industries is contrary to the government's purpose of rescuing rural areas. Its impact is by no means insignificant. Moreover, the level of cost of living is undoubtedly higher in Shanghai, but the grain industry in Shanghai has not increased, so it is no wonder that the farmers and merchants in the production areas are firmly opposed. The representatives arrived in Shanghai today and are expected to hold negotiations. <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>

<p>The Dagong Society reports that the Tianzhang Paper Mill West Factory on Yangshupu Road in this city employs more than 100 workers. Recently, due to incidents such as the foreman committing violence and beating workers, and the dismissal of workers, the Fourth District Paper Workers' Union negotiated, but there was no satisfactory result. All the workers were angry and went to the Municipal General Labor Union to petition yesterday morning. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Collective Petition The factory recently had a dispute in which a foreman beat a worker, and after mediation by Shao Xubai, a member of the General Labor Union, and Qian Chengxu of the China General Federation of Industry, a settlement was announced. However, the factory has still not fulfilled the settlement agreement. Recently, the factory dismissed a worker, and after the union negotiated in vain, more than 100 workers went to the General Labor Union to petition yesterday morning. Ge Banghe, a staff member of the union, met with them, and the workers sent representatives Yu Zhengyi, Zheng Asan, Ding Zhulin, and Chen Tuquan to state their intentions and request the General Labor Union to provide strong assistance. It was agreed that the petition would be reported to the Standing Committee and handled in conjunction with the party and government organs. The workers were satisfied and left. <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>

<p>Invention of Instant Photography: A Great Contribution to the Printing, Plate-making, and Photography Industries. Since the invention of photography to this day, there have been over a hundred years. The speed of progress and the breadth of application have long been recognized by the world. However, today, apart from the significant improvements in quality and efficiency compared to the past, the methods used are essentially the same as before. Scholars continue to use old methods, regarding them as the only way in photography, almost forgetting their shortcomings and disregarding costs, which is truly regrettable. Our renowned photography scholar, Professor Gao Weixiang, has long been aware of this. During his time studying in Europe, he dedicated himself to researching reform methods. After several years and numerous setbacks, he recently announced the success of his experimental research, inventing the so-called "Instant Photography," which has the following characteristics: (1) No need to purchase dry plates or films; (2) Direct capture of positive and negative images as media for ink printing and photosensitive printing; (3) Light sensitivity and color reproduction are superior to today's fastest and best dry plates or films; (4) From shooting to printing photos or making printing molds, it only takes a quarter of an hour; (5) The richness and fidelity of the obtained tones are unmatched by any printing paper or copying method; (6) No need for photosensitive paper, developing, fixing, and other procedures for copying. Its simplicity and economy are the same as monochrome or multicolor printing; (7) All intermediate steps of ordinary copying, plate-making, and reprinting are eliminated, greatly increasing printing efficiency; (8) No need to use lead type for printing books and newspapers. All typesetting and illustrations are completely replaced by photosensitive automatic methods; (9) All methods of using photography for recording, transmission, and copying, such as plate-making, photocopying, telephoto transmission, military photography, etc., will be exceptionally fast; (10) Dry and wet plates with weak light sensitivity can also be used for the shortest instant photography. This invention is one of the greatest contributions to the printing, plate-making, and photography industries in recent times. Its impact will surely revolutionize the old methods that have been used before. Mr. Gao is young and handsome, having studied in Europe for many years, specializing in photochemistry and colloid chemistry. He graduated from the Chemistry Department and the Photography Department of the German National University of Technology. He is very interested in research and writing, so his great invention is by no means accidental. It is heard that Mr. Gao has recently obtained the priority to apply for patents in various countries and is currently in contact with a large foreign manufacturer regarding production matters, hoping to produce it as soon as possible. It is also heard that Mr. Gao has compiled his invention's principles, methods, and applications into a long paper, entrusting it to be published by the "Photographic Journal" of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain and the German Photographic Communication Magazine published by the Austrian National Film Academy to promote public attention. Mr. Gao is now preparing everything and plans to hold a public experimental lecture at a famous academic institution in this city in the near future, which will surely attract the attention of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Central Agricultural and Commercial Bank to Open. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce took back the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to operate it independently. Since preparations began last year, official and commercial capital has been fully collected. The shareholders' meeting elected fifteen directors, including Chen Gongbo, Mei Zhezhi, Wang Tiesheng, Cheng Hejun, Li Chaoyuan, Liang Junhua, Zhang Muxian, and others, and appointed Chen Gongbo as Chairman, Mei Zhezhi as General Manager, and Li Chaoyuan as Assistant Manager. The bank's address is in a six-story building at the intersection of Ningbo Road and South Henan Road. During this preparation period, Mr. Mei, Mr. Cai, and Mr. Tu have been working on it. All building renovations are nearing completion and are quite beautiful. The opening is imminent.</p>
<p>Baichien Diesel Car Honored. The British Baichien Motor Company recently produced Baichien diesel cars, which caused a major revolution in the international transportation industry at the International Automobile Exhibition. The mechanical structure of these cars is more robust and durable than ordinary cars. The fuel is diesel, which can save 85% of the cost compared to gasoline used in ordinary cars, making it ideal for long-distance buses, public buses, and freight trucks. It is now exclusively managed by Malkang &amp; Co. in this city. On the 1st of this month, the Chinese manager of the Mechanical Department of the company, Mr. Qian Xingshu, and the factory representative, Mr. Faer, drove the car for a test using only four gallons of diesel. On the 2nd, they drove from Hangzhou to the Shaoxiao Road Exhibition, and on the 3rd, they returned to Hangzhou. Then, they drove from Hangzhou to the capital, traveling safely and quickly, no different from gasoline cars. People everywhere praised it unanimously, calling it a "monster" in the automotive industry. It is currently on display at Malkang &amp; Co., welcoming people from all walks of life to visit. It will be shipped to Hong Kong this Sunday. The company is now planning to recruit branch managers in other cities.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Clash at Sino-American Wharf: Court Holds Preliminary Hearing Yesterday. The Sino-American Petroleum Company's newly built wharf at Dinghai Road contracted all loading and unloading matters to Rongji Company. However, since Rongji started work last month, more than two hundred people claiming to be dockworkers have come forward to prevent work from proceeding. Sino-American Company petitioned the Municipal Public Security Bureau for protection. On the 26th of last month, Director Wen Hongen ordered the captain of the Third Squadron of the Police Brigade, Pei Chengzhu, along with squad leader Fu Jichuan and more than ten officers, to station themselves there. Unexpectedly, on the following day (the 27th), more than two hundred people suddenly came during Rongji's work, each carrying iron rulers and wooden sticks, severely injuring squad leader Fu and two police officers. Three people on their side were also seriously injured and sent to Sacred Heart Hospital on nearby Ningguo Road for treatment. On the second day, Captain Pei arrested Han Dexin, a Shandong man who was leading the group, at Yangshupu Little Vegetable Market and sent him to the First Special Court to be handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and detention. Unexpectedly, among the more than two hundred people, Pan Zhenggang, Xu Binggen, and others recently filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court against Li Xiahong, the manager of Rongji Company, for inflicting injuries. Yesterday, both parties were summoned to the court for a preliminary hearing. Rongji sent representative Qiu Xin to the court to state the course of events. According to Qiu's testimony in court, Rongji Company contracts the work of transporting goods to more than twenty wharves and factories. Manager Li Xiahong is only responsible for compensation for lost items of cargo owners. The work in various places is handled by dedicated personnel in each place. Zhang Qingshan is responsible for the loading and unloading matters at the Sino-American Petroleum Wharf. Finally, Qiu requested the court to investigate in detail whether the plaintiffs were genuine dockworkers, otherwise, there may be other purposes. After the interrogation, the court ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Anonymous Woman Donates Money and Materials. The Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession in Ningbo Road handles charity in a pragmatic manner, so kind men and women praise it in unison. There are often generous donors. Yesterday, a woman came to the hall in person, took out paper money amounting to six hundred yuan, and designated it for material donations. When asked for her name, she said, "Just write 'Anonymous'." It is already not easy to find someone who does good deeds without wanting to be known among scholars, let alone women. According to the hall staff, a donation of three hundred yuan last year seemed to be from this same woman. If so, her heart for doing good is sincere and even more commendable. Heaven's reward for good people is always accurate. For someone like this woman, blessings, longevity, health, and peace are surely guaranteed.</p>

<p>"Bulito" Trademark Dispute Resolved. The "Bulito" produced by Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company in this city is effective in treating lung diseases and coughs, being the only domestically produced medicine for the symptoms. Since its launch, it has become popular far and wide. However, due to the dispute with the American Pader Company's "Pareto" trademark in terms of pronunciation, the two parties have been in litigation for many years. Until recently, after the interpretation by the Judicial Yuan and the decision by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the dispute of Pader Pharmaceutical Company was clearly unfounded. Therefore, the legally created "Bulito" trademark of Jiufu Company can finally stand tall under the blue sky and white sun, fulfilling its important mission of improving national health. This year, to expand its effectiveness, three new types have been added: "Arsenic-containing," "Iodine-containing," and "Regulation-containing," along with the existing "Pure" and "Quiguai-containing" types, totaling five types, each with its own characteristics, each playing its great role according to its suitable symptoms. They are now ready for distribution and will be launched soon. The existing "Pure" and "Quiguai-containing" Bulito are available for sale in major pharmacies and companies in various cities that sell new medicines. It is advisable to take Bulito for those with weakened bodies in the spring and suffering from colds and coughs. You can purchase it on the market.</p>
<p>Passenger Jumps from Train and Dies. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 5 p.m., a train from Wuxi to Shanghai arrived at the Jiaotong Road intersection in Zhabei. A passenger jumped out of the window of a third-class carriage and immediately fell to the ground and died. He suffered injuries to his head and chest. The deceased was about twenty years old, wearing a blue coarse cloth shirt and trousers, resembling a coolie. The post police investigated and reported to the Fourth District Headquarters, which instructed the local security officer to report to the court for inspection.</p>
<p>Two Straw Boats Burned. Two straw boats were moored at the foot of the new garbage bridge on Xizang Road. Yesterday afternoon at 1:07 p.m., someone threw a cigarette butt onto the boat. Before long, thick smoke filled the air, and flames shot out in all directions. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to rescue the boats, but due to the piercing northerly wind and the easy ignition of the straw, it took more than two hours to extinguish the fire. As a result, both boats were reduced to ashes, with only the hulls remaining, sinking into the Suzhou River.</p>

<p>Notice from the Garment Industry Association Special Zone Office. The Garment Industry Association established a special zone office at No. 593 Qipu Road. A meeting of group leaders from various districts was held. More than twenty group leaders, including Dong Rufa and Qu Xingji, attended. He Yuqing was elected as chairman. Matters discussed: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau instructed the association to strictly order all garment shops under its jurisdiction to uniformly use the new standard city ruler within a time limit. The office has repeatedly advised the shops to comply with government orders, destroy the old Shanghai ruler, and purchase the legally stipulated city ruler. However, the shops still outwardly complied but secretly disobeyed, especially those in the concession area. How should this be handled? It was resolved to report to the executive committee, which would then submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures for verification. (2) The amount of membership fees owed to the office by various members is quite large. Please provide a method for the local area to collect them.

Also, the deadline for the post-war short-term public debt plus interest coupons is May 24. It has been found that there are still some of the above bonds that have not been exchanged for new bonds or have not claimed interest coupons. To protect the interests of bondholders, the Ministry of Finance has specially extended the deadline for one year. Yesterday, it distributed notices to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to inform their subordinates to take note.</p>

Chairman Sun Hongyi delivered the opening address, and Zhao Nangong reported on association affairs. On the spot, it was resolved to raise funds for the three expenses of relief, hospitals, and schools. Then, Mr. Pan Gongzhan gave a speech as a guest. His words were extremely sharp and insightful, briefly stating that Hebei's situation was like that of the three northeastern provinces before September 18th. A strong enemy was pressing the border, and destruction was imminent. However, Hebei has produced heroes throughout history, and it is said in history that "Yan and Zhao have many generous and tragic figures," such as Jing Ke assassinating the King of Qin, and the song of farewell at the Yi River, "The wind is rustling, the Yi River is cold; once a hero departs, he will never return." How tragic and generous! Regardless of the success or failure of this act, the great integrity of dedicating oneself to the country is truly admirable to future generations (the following is omitted). After the group photo, entertainment began, such as the drum performance at the Tianchan Bookstore, the motorcycle stunts at the Great World, the Shanghai Opera and Peking Opera at the Yayun Society and Juyou Society, the martial arts troupe, and Yang Lianqin's iron sheet drum performance, which were all very popular for a time. The meeting adjourned at 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Reading and Answering Questions About the Exploration of Tariff Autonomy (I). Reading Guidance: Recently, I have been studying the issue of tariffs and have read some books. I have strong doubts about some of the claims made. I am now writing down my doubts and personal opinions to ask you about them. To save valuable space, I will not add many references, and I will not mention book titles or names. Most Chinese scholars, not just scholars, but also political parties, have always had the problem of blindly adhering to established methods. For example, regarding the "issue of China's tariff autonomy," as far as I know today, it is no longer a legal issue but a factual issue. Because China's tariffs have legally been conceded by the powers, and it has the right to autonomy. China today is about to increase tariffs by 200 percent, which is also legally based. As for the reason why China cannot implement tariff protection policies like other countries, according to my consideration, it is because China's national industry has, in fact, formed an organic link with the economic aggression of imperialism, including finance and goods. For example, silk factories and rayon, yarn factories and flour mills and foreign cotton and wheat, are the most prominent examples. Therefore, the legal acquisition of this tariff autonomy is only nominal. From this, we can know that the tariff issue in China today is no longer a simple external demand for autonomy, but an internal demand for implementing protective tariffs. However, these scholars and political parties who are blind and adhere to established methods still publish their demands for China's tariff autonomy in their articles and list them in their political programs. Is this their mistake of waiting for rabbits to bump into trees, or do they have other reasons for saying so? My limited knowledge is really unable to fathom their profoundness. Please take the time to enlighten me! However, there is one point I want to state clearly. If their basis is that China has most-favored-nation treaty relationships with the major imperialist countries, it cannot unilaterally impose high tariffs on a certain type of goods from a certain country. When it comes to universal implementation, it is hindered by the financial and industrial relations between some countries' similar goods being imported and our country's current rulers, so even though there is the nominal tariff autonomy, it still cannot escape the reality of the "open door." Therefore, it is considered that China's external war still needs to purely demand tariff autonomy. However, I believe that this only indicates: (1) that our country's lack of autonomy is known to the powers; (2) that the powers are afraid that China will become a vassal of one country, so there is this restriction; (3) therefore, the core of the problem still lies in our country's lack of pursuit of autonomy, not in others not allowing our country to have autonomy. Although their permission for our country in this regard may be because they have recognized that our country cannot be autonomous, so they are doing this superficial favor? However, after they have played this set of tricks on the tariff issue, the focus of the problem has really changed. It has changed the refusal of autonomy into the inability of autonomy. Therefore, I believe that if we use these facts as the basis for the tariff still needing to purely demand external autonomy, I do not agree with this. This is foolish. We must know that imperialism is smart, and it has clearly shown that we have the responsibility to destroy China's economic independence, and Chinese national capitalists who are fully compradoristic also have a relationship. How can we turn a blind eye? Of course, we cannot therefore relax our vigilance against imperialism. Please correct whether these views are correct or not. (Qin Jing's letter)</p>

<p>Spring Changes. Xianxian. In recent years, the changes in the cheongsam can hardly be described as "rapid," but high collars, low collars, square collars, round collars, stiff collars, soft collars, just the collar alone are enough to say that there is a small change every three days and a major change every five days. The rest, such as the placket, sleeves, piping, and slits, are constantly changing. Unless you open your eyes wide and follow the trend of change step by step, you will inevitably fall behind. Because of the changes in women's cheongsams, I feel that it is really not easy to be a person in this era, because our environment is also constantly changing like the style of cheongsam. In order to adapt to the environment and sacrifice individuality, but when the successfully transformed individuality adapts to the environment, the environment has changed very subtly again. After watching, just as you will grasp the times, the times cruelly turn their heads and leave you behind. Education is also the same. University system and specialized system, three-three system and two-four system, preparatory system and high school system, academic year system and credit system. A certain system, imported from the East and West for less than a year, and before the trial is effective, the second academic system has already been imported, and its theory is better than the first. Naturally, unwilling to fall behind, we have to try the second one, but just as we start, the better third one is waving to you there. Therefore, human customs are also changing non-stop. From emphasizing chastity and building arches, to advocating freedom of marriage, widows should not observe chastity, and then transforming to abandoned wives and widows without status in society, it is not easy to find a partner, because abandoned wives and widows are no longer virgins. Smoking opium used to be a grand scene, and then everyone thought that smoking opium was a vulgar activity, a decadent act, but recently, without putting on a show, taking a few puffs of opium does not count as a high-class Chinese person. The marriage issue has changed from the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers to free combination, and then from free combination to "with the consent of both parents after being introduced by Mr. XX," and recently it has changed to "what about the two of us?" Look, European countries are also changing there. From autocracy to democracy to dictatorship. This set of tricks is really variable.</p>
<p>Northeast Four Company Commanders. Zhang Henshui. Chapter Twenty-Fifth. Tearful faces send people away from home to return to the distant garrison. The wind and sand are clear all night, and the fortress is stationed alone. Zhao Ziqiang said, "Since the battalion commander has a telegram to go, how can I not come? Not to mention that I have been married for several days, even if it was the first day of my marriage, and the order arrived the next day, I would still have to come." Baofang stretched out her thumb and smiled, saying, "Good. Soldiers must be like this, from the ordinary soldier to the commander-in-chief, they are all heroes, and China will be strong." The regimental commander told me to send you a telegram, so I sent you a telegram according to his instructions. As for why, I don't know either. Two days ago, enemy planes flew over the Great Wall, and the atmosphere was a bit tense. I haven't heard any news these past two days, so it seems to have calmed down again." On the way, Ziqiang kept thinking that maybe there was some change on the front line. When he arrived at the regimental headquarters, he didn't see any special activity, so he thought it was odd. At first, he thought it was a military secret, so it hadn't been announced yet. Now, the battalion commander also said that nothing was happening, so the regimental commander hadn't revealed anything either. Even if something was happening, it wasn't that urgent. He regretted why he hadn't stayed at home for a few more days. Baofang was talking, and saw that Ziqiang's attitude was slowly changing, and he seemed a bit hesitant, so she smiled and said, "You must think that I sent this telegram too early. Even if you stayed at home for two more days, nothing would have happened." Ziqiang blushed and forced a smile, saying, "I don't think so. Even if I stayed at home for two more days, I would have to leave home at this time anyway. What's the difference between arriving two days late and arriving two days early?" Baofang smiled and said, "Of course there's a difference. You go rest for a while, and I'll go tell the regimental commander that you've arrived." Ziqiang saw that the battalion commander had nothing to say, so he returned to his company headquarters. At this time, the sound of the wind howling in the sky was even more intense, and sometimes it suddenly increased in force, rolling up the sand and small pieces of wood on the ground, making a rustling sound on the roof. Ziqiang sat in a small room, supporting his head with both hands, thinking deeply. (330)</p>
<p>Barber. Zhuo. A person cannot go more than ten days without changing underwear; likewise, one cannot go more than two months without getting a haircut. There is a principle of "necessity" in this. To put it simply, it is "helplessness!" I am a lazy person, so I have this kind of excuse. On the contrary, beauty-loving friends prepare their own safety razors and shave their beards in front of the mirror every day. Every ten or twenty days, they go to the beauty salon to sit for two hours. Not only do they not have the distress of "necessity," but they also think it is "pleasant," a required course for social interaction. Because everyone, regardless of old or young, men or women, and even bald people, has the opportunity to approach the barber. Taking advantage of sitting on a spring seat and draped in a snow-white scarf, thinking about the various things about the barber during the most leisurely one or two hours is also a very interesting pastime. The barber's uniform is white as the standard, just like the nurses in the hospital. But I think it might as well prepare a few more colors, such as the stimulating red, the feudal tiger yellow, the bright tender green, and the elegant violet, so that customers can have the pleasure of refreshing and pleasing the eye. The barber's work has three major procedures: first, trimming; second, neatening; third, combing. It symbolizes the improvement of national affairs. Barbers also pay special attention to the art of beauty, which is a free procedure that is mutually related to their profession, just like a person who can do things, can eat, and also wants fame. Barbers can also perm hair, perming it into exquisite art patterns. Although the profession is small, it is worth respecting as an "artist." Barbers have the ability to organize hair that is as messy as a hedgehog into a well-organized and orderly manner, whether your hair has always been leaning to the left or to the right. After his kindness and power are applied together, stroking and combing, the rebellious will be corrected root by root. This wonderful skill is worthy of public admiration! Barbers have repeatedly pulled out many "white seeds" for me. Out of gratitude, I pay my most sincere respects to the artist who is concerned with</p>

Large players such as Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongrun, Changyu, Dadecheng, Tianfeng, and Yong etc. advanced aggressively, with Chengfeng and Yong covering shorts. Although Bingxing and Guangbang, etc., supplied the market, the domestic market continued to tighten, and banks showed a strong appetite. Hedging activity among peers gradually increased, and the situation was strongest at noon. After closing, the price rose even further to over 55 yuan. Reuters reported that over 30,000 automobile workers in the US had issued strike threat notices, which did not have much impact. The March futures also rose accordingly. The price of red gold was calculated at 963 yuan. The central bank's spot price was similar to the April futures price, so there were few transactions. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 948 yuan and six jiao, down one yuan and three jiao from the previous close. Goods opened at eight yuan and four jiao.

<p>The money market has traditionally opened two sessions daily, morning and afternoon, for trading. Since February 18, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, all industries were quiet, and public business and goods were not moving, demand for funds was light. Therefore, the money industry also followed customs, stopping trading, and only opening the morning session for trading. Currently, commerce is gradually prospering, and the circulation of various aspects is also increasing. Procedures are more tedious and cumbersome. Therefore, the Market Committee decided to reopen the afternoon session for trading on March 10 (Saturday). In this way, two sessions will still be opened daily thereafter, without interruption, restoring its former appearance. Stock bonds hover and brew a rising trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation in the Chinese Stock Exchange, generally observed, was still hovering and brewing, but the trend was already strong, and it may still go uphill first, then downhill. Generally, most people think that bulls will certainly not easily leave, and bears are also unwilling to cover immediately. New bulls are also tasteless, and try very little, so they tend to hover. Few know that in these days, the hovering has aroused the interest of short sellers, and the accumulated transactions, although small, are not few in number. A slight replenishment can easily raise the price. Judging from the environment, there is also no reason for a sudden drop, and it cannot always hover and brew like this. Based on the above summary, there is an observation that we will see a high side first. Judging from the price trend of the upper and lower afternoon markets yesterday, and the situation of adoption or abandonment by various gangs, there is also no sign of a quick downturn. Transactions in No. 4, 12, and 35 were in greater demand. The sellers were still sporadic retail investors, and they were more enthusiastic. Although the rises and falls of each market were small, in general, the overall trend rose throughout the day. In fact, the buyers were unwilling to raise prices, and the sellers firmly demanded higher prices. A rough look seems to be still hovering, but it already has a tendency to rise secretly. If we see new high prices again, there should still be about one yuan of good prospects. The market price results uniformly rose by one jiao to four jiao. The 22 Customs was the only one to rise by nine jiao because No. 46 had already stopped being sold, so it still felt cheaper than other types. The total number of transactions was 5,496,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 5,495,000 yuan in futures. Here is a comparison of their rises and falls, and highs and lows, listed on the left, (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<p>The New York industrial stock decline was the most severe</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 6th that the New York stock market was still sluggish, because the loans guaranteed by Van Sweringen were not repaid. The railway stocks showed weakness, and other stocks were led by them. Gold and silver stocks were first loose because the rumors that the Ministry of Finance would raise the price of gold did not materialize, but then returned to firm. The situation in the small exchange was also mixed and sluggish. Bonds were mixed and slightly lower, but US Treasury bonds were firm due to government support, and foreign public bonds were stable. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 810,000 shares. Wheat trading was light, and there was no improvement in the news. Cotton, although Roosevelt supported the prompt passage of the Bankhead Act, it had no impact. Before the implementation of this case, it seemed to have lost its power to influence the market price. There were sell-offs at high prices. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 103.84 Down 1.18</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 48.70 Down 0.19</p>

<p>11 Commodities 53.80 Down 0.45</p>
<p>Yarn and cotton fluctuate erratically</p>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the situation was still flat, with no spirit of revitalization. Because the current yarn business is too sluggish, there is no atmosphere of excitement in any way, so although the low market is dry, it is still difficult to arouse the meaning of those who do more. However, a certain manufacturer still struggled hard when it fell, so the decline was also curbed by it.</p>
<p>The labeled yarn lacks brilliance</p>
<p>The opening of the labeled yarn market in the previous session fell by 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 jiao in each month due to the decline of US cotton and the lack of confidence. In the afternoon, it was heard that the US cotton news was good, and the short sellers had some replenishment, and it rose by 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 14,900 bales. It was found that Senkang sold 1,200 bales, Dachangcheng 900 bales, Tonghe 450 bales, and Zonglong 500 bales. Huikang bought 700 bales, Jinchang 850, Shenji 500 bales, Gengfeng 500 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, Yuanda 350 bales, and Chunji 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the demand for current cotton from various factories was depressed. Because the yarn market was sluggish, the import appetite was quite sluggish, so the sellers were bearish. However, in the afternoon, the US cotton news was good, and Roosevelt's proposal on the Bankhead Act that the cotton ginning of more than 10 million bales would be subject to a tax of 1 jiao and 2 fen per pound, this case has been said to be able to implement. At this time, people's hearts were slightly shocked, and the market slightly returned to high.</p>
<p>The labeled drug market hovered</p>
<p>The opening of the labeled cotton market in the previous session fell by 1 and 2 jiao following the US and Indian cotton markets. In the afternoon, rumors were spread on the dumping market that the US cotton reduction plan was said to be redundant, people's hearts were shaken, and each month rose by 1 and a half to 2 jiao. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 57,700 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 900 dan, Hengyi 900 dan, Minghua 900 dan, Changfeng 1,900 dan, Hengchang 1,100 dan, Xiesheng 1,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,100 dan, Tongfu 1,000 dan, Yuanda 3,500 dan, Zhenda 1,000 dan, and Yifeng 1,100 dan.

<p>Factory needs are sluggish</p>
<p>The sales of current cotton are bleak, and the factories' intentions are very lax. The source is estimated to be 1,100 bales of Yao cotton. The current cotton price is as follows:</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 47.25 Yufeng Factory entered 162 pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 48.25</p>

<p>Grain and flour futures market saw Tianjin gangs selling out in the morning</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the market opened in the morning, the market for each month turned weak again. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was about 2 jiao lower in Chicago and 1 jiao lower in Canada, the market was flat and tired after opening. In addition, the saying that large factories would stop production had not yet been implemented, and the sales of customer gangs were still not strong. Therefore, Tianjin gangs had sold out, so the market for each month entered a soft road again. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month tended to hover, because the factory's chips had not been issued, and the minds of outsiders were still stable, so there was little entry and exit. The future rise depends on the foreign market changing. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen, April and May fell by 1 fen, June fell by 1 fen 7 li and a half, July and August fell by 1 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Future wheat is in a static state</p>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market, after the opening of the upper and lower afternoon markets, the market for each month was generally stable, but the transactions for each month were still rare. Because there were no new chips added to the buying and selling, the market speculation had no way to start. Moreover, the situation between near and far was different, and it must wait until the new wheat is approaching before it can be lively. Only a few cars opened this month, and the price was good for 1 fen. July was also better for more than 2 fen, and there were no comparisons. The current wheat market situation is still stable, because the inventory is limited, the factory appetite is still good, Kai Guzhen wheat is 3 yuan 4 jiao and a half, to 4 jiao 3 fen, totaling 2,000 bags, bought by Fuxin.</p>
<p>River rice fell a few points</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of each gang was similar to the previous one, totaling nearly 40 numbers (more than 5,000 shi). The market situation seemed to have a turning upward, but the market in the future was all eating and drinking problems, and there were those who returned the tickets. Therefore, the market situation was soft. The customer gangs wrapped up the North and South Ocean gangs, and the resulting transactions were only 1,700 to 800 bags of Qingjiao Songsi Xilian and other late rice, and the market was small for 3 or 4 fen, and the higher one was 1 or 2 fen lower. It is really a phenomenon that is difficult to predict before and after. The price of Changbang Su Tong and Nangang Japonica, which are usually purchased by urban and rural shops, has fallen by 5 fen, and foreign Jiantou rice has also been tired for several fen. Du Jiantou rice has settled down. Because of limited outbound routes, Yinyuan rice will eventually be soft when it encounters a slight surge of goods. The arrival and sale of Bianyuan rice are both flat, and there is no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 ships arrived from various places in Hexia. The market was very small in the early morning and slightly improved in the evening. The market price of white Japonica, Yangdu, and Bukejian rice was fixed, the price of Baiyuan and Yinyuan was close to the corner, and the early Boda rice was also tired, and the price of Kejian rice fluctuated up and down.</p>
<p>Merchants from Fuzhou and Quanzhou have all purchased</p>
<p>Yesterday's Kejian market situation, the rise and fall were inconsistent, the arrival was slightly less, and the inventory was abundant. The customer gang's outbound appetite from this street was continuous, and the market was still lively. However, among the various rice stored and arrived in the market, the secondary grade was the most, and the local Kejian's sales selected high-grade rice. Therefore, the market price of the high-grade rice yesterday rose by 35 fen to nearly 1 jiao, such as the high-grade Jijiwan and Jiji oil rice, which opened higher than 1 jiao. The middle-grade rice was still flat and fair. Low-grade rice arrived more, and the customer dealers were eager to sell. The entrants were not welcome, and the market was soft for 23 fen. The total market sold 6,671 bags of various rice, of which 200 bags of Jiangxi Jizao were handled by the Wenzhou gang, priced at 6 yuan and 3 jiao. This street sold 1,700 bags, and the rest were handled by Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Raw Sugar and White Sugar Follow the Rise of Customs Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, because the customs gold rose by 1935, the association's price for raw sugar and white sugar also shouted to rise to 19 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, but no transaction was made. Hechi 15 yuan and 8 jiao, Taikoo O-mark 20 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, this factory's white No. 1 18 yuan and 6 jiao, because the Qingpi was thin, the market image was still lively, opened to more than 100 boxes, priced</p>

<p>Qian Wenbin, the police chief of the Tianning Temple police station in Jiaxing, took nude pictures from the Shenghe Grocery Store on Beida Street, which aroused dissatisfaction among the onlookers and led to a quarrel. Subsequently, the police officers of the police station went out armed and beat people, causing the police whistle to sound in chaos. The fire brigades of various neighborhoods mistakenly thought it was a fire and arrived at the scene one after another. Afterwards, some of the public and reporters gathered in front of the county public security bureau, and were shot at by the police, causing injuries to Shen Jinguan and others. The details have been recorded in the newspaper on the 6th. Now, Shen Jinguan has died of serious injuries, and because his family has nothing, the county chamber of commerce has temporarily advanced 200 yuan for funeral expenses. At the same time, the father of the deceased, Shen Jiqing, appealed to the county party headquarters and various legal groups to organize a support association. Prosecutor Wang Bangyan of the local court has successively inspected the injured and the deceased at Dexin and Jiaxing hospitals, and also went to the Public Security Bureau and the police station to survey the overturned objects. The police chief Qian Wenbin who caused the incident has been sent to the court detention center to prepare for interrogation. The general public still hopes that Director Gao will investigate the police officers who fired the shots and send them to court for interrogation. It is also learned that after the provincial department received reports from both sides on the cause of the incident, it will send personnel to He to investigate. The county party headquarters has issued a notice to all county residents, ordering them to strictly maintain order and wait for a resolution. On the morning of the 7th, it convened a meeting of representatives from the county chamber of commerce, the fire brigade, the first district office, and the county government to discuss the punishment of the police chief who caused the incident and the compensation for the injured and dead. The resolution was: (1) To form a tragedy committee, organized by various legal groups and local gentry. The county chamber of commerce will be designated to draft an organizational outline and be responsible for convening its establishment. The outline will be submitted to the county party headquarters for record. (2) The county party headquarters will send a letter to the directors of various legal groups to jointly investigate all the details of the case impartially with the party and government, and create a fair report to be sent to the administrative and judicial organs as powerful evidence. (3) The county party headquarters and the county chamber of commerce will separately raise funds to compensate the family members of the deceased Shen Jinguan and subsidize the medical expenses of the injured.</p>

<p>In Luosi Canal area, Beixiang Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, farmer Hu Youfa has cultivated three or four hundred acres of farmland and is quite wealthy. The other day was his birthday, and he held a banquet. It happened that Wang Jinmin, a tax collector for the third district's land tax, came to Hu's place to collect taxes. A fight broke out due to words. Hu Youfa's son and brother surrounded and beat Wang Jinmin, causing him to be seriously injured all over his body. On the spot, dozens of yuan of collected donations were also lost. For a time, the public was very angry. Such rudeness can endanger the lives of civil servants everywhere. In addition to reporting to the district office for handling, Wang Jinmin also filed a criminal lawsuit with the court in person.</p>

<p>Jin Youhao, a farmer in the area bordering Jiaxing County outside the west gate of this county, is quite wealthy. He has a child who is only seven years old and attends a nearby elementary school. Suddenly, in the middle of the night the other day, more than a dozen bandits broke down the door and entered, forbidding anyone from making a sound. After looting, they kidnapped the seven-year-old child and left. Jin Youhao reported to the Weidi (禾地, a name for Jiaxing) and the local county security group for strict investigation. Soon, the child's whereabouts were discovered near Xinmou Town under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing. The security group sent a team to follow and arrested many male and female kidnappers and four boy and girl hostages according to the address. They were all sent to this county. After County Chief Yang interrogated them, he immediately imprisoned them.</p>

He has now returned to the province after completing his official duties. It is reported that the impression of this investigation is quite good. Once the branch building is found, it can be established in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Sports Litigation <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>At the Second National Games, it was heard that several world records were broken. At a time when our country cannot compete on the world's political and economic stage, it must be said that it is a great honor for this weak nation. Therefore, our patriotic people have found a great way to save the country and revitalize the nation from this fact, and shouted, "Save the country through sports." The meaning is that the prosperity of the country and nation depends on healthy citizens, and healthy citizens rely on strong bodies, and strong bodies depend on promoting sports and developing exercise. Their sincere patriotic intentions are reasonable and justified.</p>
<p>However, in this "national salvation avenue," there are many "deeply distressing" facts. According to reports, on December 16 last year, Jiaotong University and Jinan University held a Jiangnan University football match, and Shen Huichun, a member of the China Sports Referee Association, was hired as a notary. Because Jiaotong University lost, they vented their anger on the referee. Students such as Qin Shaoji actually beat Shen Huichun seriously injured. Both sides were unwilling to back down, and filed a lawsuit with the local court. As a dignified national university, they actually went to court for this "competition" dispute, no wonder "public opinion was in an uproar." This issue aroused the mediation of Mr. Wang Zhengting, the chairman of the National Sports Association, and evolved into the "Shen Case" in the history of the sports world, which is also a "nationally watched" shocking event.</p>
<p>If we observe this issue with the perspective of "saving the country through sports," how did it arise, and what is its impact on society? We cannot help but say a few words here. If the purpose of sports is to strengthen the people or even to promote "national salvation," then it should never be about raising a few athletes and "trophy" collectors, but should expand the scope of the people and carry out a wide range of popularization work. Because the ultimate goal of sports is always to temper the body, and it is never for the sake of sports, or for the sake of trophies and silver medals.</p>
<p>However, this true meaning has not been understood. The fact that sports have become a "circle" and sports have become "experts" has already explained this. Although there are many sports organizations, "clubs," and "teams" in various circles, generally speaking, sports are a patent of students and intellectuals. In particular, many school authorities regard trophies and silver shields as advertisements to attract students, and cultivate athletes with the same enthusiasm as dog track owners. This is an undeniable fact. Under this trend, two morbid states are created: on the one hand, the "aristocratization" of sports, and on the other hand, the vanity of experts who take sports as a profession and a place to settle down. The virtue of the first fact can be seen in many school athletes who do not attend classes, do not repeat grades, drink milk, and receive subsidies; and the manifestation of the second phenomenon is the many "fans" and the "cheerleading squads" of female students in various schools. Therefore, under the mutual use of cultivation and vanity, many indecent situations have arisen in the Chinese sports world, and the so-called "Shen Case" is only a small part of it.</p>
<p>It is said that this "Shen Case," which shocked the sports world, has been resolved through the mediation of Mr. Wang Zhengting, relying on the power of this "interpreter," but the pathological phenomenon of sports bias remains the same. Whenever we spend five cents or one yuan to come out of the YMCA Central Sports Field, as if we have entered a dog track or rabbit track once, and think of many people who are weak and isolated from sports, who have no place and no possibility to exercise, we always feel infinitely "deeply distressed" about the future of this "sports saving the country."</p>

<h3 id="e169">In the Teahouse <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Random Notes on Returning Home</p>
<p>I ran out alone, but had nowhere to go. My hometown was so unfamiliar to me. I cast another nostalgic glance at the old trees and broken houses, and then walked aimlessly forward on the cobblestone path that seemed familiar.</p>
<p>Many people slipped past me, many houses slipped past me, I felt like I was dreaming. Is this my hometown? The question in front of me led me to the street.</p>
<p>The three words "Wangjianglou" (Overlooking the River Teahouse) came into my view. This was the place I used to rest every day. I don't like tea, but I used to use it to relieve boredom; now it has become a habit. At that time, it seemed like someone was urging me to step inside. The person in charge of the tea stove was surprised: "Young Master XX is back?" He stared at me as I sat down at the teatable. Doesn't he dream? I thought:</p>
<p>Wangjianglou is a three-story building built on the only official road in my hometown, and it is called "Overlooking the River" for that reason. There are regular tea drinkers who come every day, rain or shine, and have fixed seats (I used to be one of them). In the past five years, the teahouse has probably changed, and many people are no longer familiar to me. Several people nodded to me because the tea server said "Young Master XX," or asked awkwardly, "Back from Shanghai?" I no longer belong to my hometown, my hometown has forgotten me!</p>
<p>Those newly emerging tea drinkers are no different from the past. They talk about rice prices every day. The bankruptcy of the countryside has nothing to do with them. They are all big landlords. Now they are talking about the rice prices. Yesterday, someone surnamed XX sold hundreds of dan of rice for X yuan and X jiao, and today someone surnamed XX sold rice and the price has risen by two jiao. I seemed to hate their expressionless attitude, but wasn't I like this before? I have truly been abandoned by my hometown.</p>
<p>The old gentleman sitting in the corner, who used to be my chess partner, now opened his mouth: "I heard that the official road on the dam is going to be opened?"</p>
<p>This question gave everyone a stimulus. Damming the river and hoarding rice are conflicting topics, so there was a discussion that didn't get to the point; just then a tea drinker came in, and the topic turned to a gambling game at the home of a tea drinker last night; someone had good luck, and someone lost thousands of yuan, and they could even recite the details of a certain domino last night, vividly. I opened my eyes wide, as if I was a gambler last night too.</p>
<p>"Monk Kills His Wife!" Someone shouted. What the teahouse needs is this kind of news, so even the most basic teahouse has a copy of the Shih Pao (Eastern Times), let alone Wangjianglou!</p>
<p>A group of people surrounded the table with the newspaper, snatching to read it and reading it aloud. After everyone understood the plot, they began to discuss it, but without a chairman. Some compared it to similar cases in the past, some... before long they talked about women's menstruation, genitals, and old people and young people talking about the same things, always smiling. The old man who proposed damming the river forgot that he was hoarding thousands of dan of rice at home and would suffer losses because of it, and the gambler who lost money last night also forgot that the thousands of yuan he lost were all silver dollars.</p>
<p>I walked to the bathroom. I saw two large lines under the words "Pay Attention to Hygiene": "Please take a step further for urination." I looked down from the window, and the destination of the funnel was this official road overlooking the river. My hometown doesn't have flush toilets, and no one pours out the night soil early in the morning. Their only place to clean the toilets is this official road. As for dumping garbage in the river, it's even more a matter of course. So, no matter what, the "water" in the teahouse is taken from this river, and it is "paying attention to hygiene" to "take a step further" for "urination" into the funnel.</p>
<p>I returned to my seat, and didn't dare to pick up the teapot again. I felt strangely greasy and wanted to vomit. Over there, the proposal for "Monk Kills His Wife" had not yet been put to a vote, and inexplicably the second proposal "Tonight's Gambling Game" occurred again. This seemed easier to resolve. A gambling game would continue at the home of the tea drinker from last night.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, twilight had gathered from all directions, and an afternoon came to an end. Many questions were left behind as people went home, or perhaps they would never talk about these kinds of questions again. What they remembered was tonight's gambling game. The topics of conversation in the teahouse tomorrow could arise temporarily, so there was no need to prepare urgently tonight; and... what else? I didn't come to Wangjianglou the next day.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Flower Vase <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>After this letter reaches your editorial department, I hope you</p>
<p>can reply to me within three days. These three days are such precious time! If this deadline passes, I will decide to walk my own path. How I long to be enlightened by you, sir!</p>
<p>The problem is this: I am a graduate of higher primary school, and now I am working as a "flower vase" in a certain office. (A painful phrase!) Among many "flower vases," I am quite favored by the manager. In fact, that beast in human form harbors malicious intentions towards me. In three months, I have been subjected to his lewd jokes four times, and I have cleverly escaped his traps each time. At the end of last year, I originally wanted to resign immediately to respect our female dignity, but when I thought about my parents, siblings, and younger siblings starving after I lost my job, I felt it was better to endure the humiliation. As long as I am clever and have an iron will, he cannot subdue me. What do I have to fear? Unexpectedly, this unpredictable human wickedness has attacked me beyond my expectations. Last Friday night, that thing insisted on inviting me and another colleague to talk, ostensibly to discuss official business, but not in the office. Instead, he opened a room in a hotel. We knew his intentions as soon as we stepped into the hotel. Naturally, it wasn't about official business, because there were no male or female colleagues from the office, only him and a servant. He prepared a lot of food and wine to entertain us. I was only filled with anger and defensiveness, and had no intention of engaging in any shady business with him. Unexpectedly, things became more and more outrageous. After …, another … arrived, … he… particularly close to us. He said a lot of pointless things. Later, the manager even tricked my female colleague into another room. That young master didn't come back either. At this time, only he and I were in the room. He planned to get me drunk with wine, but I firmly refused to drink, and we argued until twelve o'clock. I insisted on leaving, but he wouldn't let me. I shouted and cried. The waiter pretended not to notice. I knew he had paid money, and he had arranged everything. At this time, I was only prepared to fight him to the death. It was unsuccessful, so I changed to pleading and using money as a soft tactic. Sir, that's how we made a scene all night. I was never subdued.</p>
<p>Sir, in this "bright daylight" Shanghai, can you believe that such insults to professional women actually happen?</p>
<p>I returned home at dawn the next day. I cried all day. I originally wasn't going to work anymore, but my family didn't understand. Instead, they suspected that I had someone else in my heart. I had no choice but to endure humiliation and shame to work for my family. Unexpectedly, this beast deliberately spread dirty words, creating a foul atmosphere to trap me and make me submit. On the third day, as soon as I entered the office, I saw many colleagues, some were angry, some were sneering, and some even congratulated me. Heavens! I cried and went home before I even finished work.</p>
<p>After suffering this kind of humiliation, sir! I can't bear it anymore. I can't consider my parents, siblings, and younger siblings anymore. I have no way to go. What hope do I have? Isn't it the same for women everywhere? Why should I live and be trampled by others?</p>
<p>Sir! I have decided that I only have Ai Xia's path to take!</p>
<p>However, I feel that there is still a glimmer of hope, but I want to find a first path to struggle. (I'm not afraid of death.) Ai Xia's death has already caused criticism, saying that she didn't have enough understanding. Sir! My situation is not as good as Ai Xia's, and my abilities are not as good as Ai Xia's, but before I live or die, I still want someone to guide me. I don't want to bear the accusation of "not having enough understanding" in this world again. Sir! Is there really a path for us women to take? Name temporarily hidden, March 5th.</p>
<p>After reading the above letter, the editor couldn't help but tremble, and tears couldn't help but well up in my eyes. In a state of extreme anxiety, I hurriedly looked for the date of mailing. Fortunately, the date of this letter is the 5th, and it's only been two days since today. Now that I have this opportunity, the editor respectfully and sincerely wants to tell Miss So-and-so, and also ask the female compatriots in the female community and all kind people who care about women's issues!</p>
<p>Regarding Miss So-and-so's problem, it is indeed not a surprising thing in today's society. This is already an open secret, and it happens everywhere every day. Society considers it too ordinary and not worth a second glance. Thousands upon thousands of women have either accepted this kind of trampling in silence or committed suicide. After suicide, society doesn't necessarily cause any surprise, and it ends up with some boring tabloids creating rogue, sensational material. Therefore! In such a society, when Miss So-and-so cries out, "Is there really a path for us women to take?" it is not out of her weakness, but rather it shows the seriousness of today's women's issue. Miss So-and-so's problem is naturally not her personal problem, but a serious problem shared by all professional women.</p>
<p>We greatly admire Miss So-and-so's spirit of struggle. In such a cold and indifferent society, even if she has the idea of committing suicide, we cannot strictly blame her. We can only sympathize and only find opportunities to enlighten her and increase her understanding. There is nothing else to say. What's more, Miss So-and-so herself clearly asks to "find another path to struggle." As the editor writes this, I feel even more uneasy. Looking at the alarming suicide news printed in today's newspapers every day, I think most of them are people who still want to live, but can't find the first path to struggle. Because they don't have Miss So-and-so's ability or level of understanding, the result is death in this contradiction. The responsibility is certainly borne by society, but we who survive still lack guidance. I think that if society had good guidance, many promising young men and women could be saved from this large group of suicides and their lives could be used on a path of striving for a better cause.</p>
<p>The following is the reply to Miss So-and-so:</p>
<p>According to the usual explanation, since Miss So-and-so is unwilling to endure this kind of humiliation anymore, the best way is to resign. The next best thing is to give that manager a serious warning, telling him that if he has any inappropriate behavior in the future, she will definitely take legal action. However, Miss So-and-so already knows that the first method is unsuccessful. She cannot watch her family "starve to death." As for the warning, it's even more of a joke, because since you still have to work under him now, how dare you offend him again? You certainly cherish your reputation and your body, but "eating is something that must also be taken into consideration!"</p>
<p>So the crux of the problem is: Under the chains of economic bondage, it is not surprising that women are insulted. This is bound to happen in a society where people use economic power to oppress others. Therefore, if Miss So-and-so really wants to seek liberation, it is not to resign and find another job, because "it is the same for women everywhere;" but to concentrate all her efforts on transforming society. This is by no means a lofty ideal, nor is it a distant path! It's a roundabout path. Because in this society, the pain that everyone feels cannot be solved by individual effort alone. There is a solution only after the fundamental transformation of society.</p>
<p>This is certainly a distant path, but what other path is there for us miserable people to take! And as long as we walk the path, no matter how far away it is, we will eventually reach it.</p>

<p>— Written by Italian M. Serao, Translated by Jingxin</p>
<p>"My father is satisfied, my aunts all sent their congratulations, my cousins are angry, my friends congratulated me sarcastically in the coffee shop, my good friends shook my hand; so my marriage is very reasonable. I cannot deny that Lulu is very beautiful; when her eyes are so full of playfulness looking at me, when she laughs loudly showing her white teeth, I want to hold her little head in my hands and kiss her over and over again. Her attitude is elegant, her personality is lively, always cheerful and kind, always telling jokes and witty, always mischievous, never depressed, we can definitely get along well. I hate that kind of stern face, especially for the one I love. I seem to feel that in that kind of face, there is a secret sorrow hidden, I have not experienced this sorrow, and I don't know how to deal with it, or maybe this sorrow is caused by me. Sophia - my fiancée's sister, has this ability to bother me with her cold, unresponsive face. Every time I see her, my wisdom is useless, the smile leaves my lips; even if the most beautiful spring sun is shining, I seem to be banished to the gray November sky, even with Lulu I don't have the courage to joke; that Miss Sophia drives away all the joy. She may have seen the unpleasant impression she gives me, because she doesn't look at me when she talks to me, doesn't shake hands with me, and answers my questions with the simplest words. She must know that I don't like her. Maybe she is angry because of this.</p>
<p>"Lulu is always laughing loudly. She is very young. She has never said a serious word to me, even when she wants to be serious, it seems like she is joking. She loves me, but not to the point of frenzy. Frankly speaking, my love is not frenzied either; that's the best way. On my part, I have established two principles in my heart: first, engaged lovers should get along well; second, they should never start with a violent passion. Our situation is like this, so Lulu and I should be very happy. We will travel all over Italy, but not in a hurry, taking short trips, enjoying ourselves in extreme comfort, stopping wherever we like, and looking at even the most meaningless things. We will spend three months in this way; no, that's not enough, we can plan for four months; it would make me very happy to keep Lulu away from Sophia's boredom for a considerable period of time. But, I ask, is it natural for that girl to be so solemn at her age? She must be twenty-three years old. She refuses to say it clearly herself. In fact, she has beautiful eyes and a … frame, if she wasn't so stern-faced, she could be pleasant. I bet she will become an old maid; maybe that's her secret pain, maybe she has experienced love, an unfortunate love? -- I am very curious to know the reason for her stern face --, when Lulu and I are alone, I want to ask her --"</p>

<h3 id="e173">Are American Film Publications Just Publicity Tools for Companies or Stars? <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Qi</p>
<p>(1) The "Yes" Side (Part 1)</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty-two types of American film publications, referring to magazines. Their sales range from a minimum of 126,000 to a maximum of 565,000. I must know that the sales of American newspapers and magazines are almost all verified by a sales audit association and cannot be falsely reported. Therefore, the sales of more than twenty film magazines, taken together, form an important part of American social life and are also a facet of American culture. Statistically, a total of 8.8 million people spend ten or twenty cents each month to buy film magazines to read. If we take the average of two or three people reading one film magazine, which is still the lowest statistic, we can know that there are always two to three million people reading film magazines each month. And their influence is also very considerable.</p>
<p>Now some people say that these film magazines are loyal servants of Hollywood, hired propagandists, and tools of the stars. They cover up the countless sins in the film city and fan the flames of the sexually charged film industry, wielding influence in American society. The Hollywood film life and the status of the stars are depicted as magnificent and unapproachable, and their sole function is to act as mouthpieces for film companies, promoting their sales.</p>
<p>The above is the opening shot of a general attack on film publications. To prove the validity of the above statement, they examined the content of these magazines. They found many untrue and incomplete things in these magazines. The first is hearsay gossip. They say that gossip has become the central component of film magazines. What the first magazine publishes is all as much nonsense as possible, and no one is willing to seek to publicize the true situation of Hollywood. According to what is published in film magazines, Hollywood is the only paradise in America, the paradise in the world. Almost every magazine has a nonsense gossip column. They all have their Walter Winchell (a famous Hollywood reporter). They are all-knowing and all-understanding people; they can drill into everyone's heart and everyone's home to spy on news, so that they already know a piece of news before even the gods know it. Isn't this too vague and absurd?</p>
<p>In addition to short pieces of nonsense gossip, there are also many long articles. Where do these long articles come from? Even if they are not written by film companies or movie stars and submitted to the magazine for publication, they must be published with the authorization of related parties. Their content is also very empty and has no substantive news. They are mostly based on a star's gossip. If a smart person tries to investigate, he can discover that every time a long article about a star's life is published, it is immediately followed by the release of a film, and the star being promoted is also the protagonist of that film. We need to know that the editorial departments of these film magazines are all in cahoots with the advertising departments. There is no distinction between them. So these articles are all nonsense for a film or a star. For the sake of their own income, they willingly allow themselves to be used by the company authorities to fool the general public. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e174">Review of "Eskimo" <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Eskimo | Grand Theater |</p>
<p>When we accidentally discovered this "Eskimo" in the midst of the lewd atmosphere of a series of romantic love dramas in American films, we should immediately praise the author W.S. Van Dyke. Needless to say, we should give this work a very high evaluation.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for readers to understand, I will briefly introduce it here. In 1927, he filmed "White Shadow in the South Seas" in the South Seas. In 1929, he went deep into the heart of Africa to film "Trader Horn," which we will never forget. As for this film, it was made in the Arctic Ocean in 1933. Undoubtedly, this is a great work.</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about the structure of the story, from which we can see a glimpse of the idea.</p>
<p>First of all, what we need to know is why he wanted to use the Arctic Ocean as the background? This is of course because the wonders of icebergs and snow can be used as a spectacle on the screen, but what we should pay attention to now is how he adopts the material and how he handles the subject matter. In the middle of this, we can recognize his worldview.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing the life and customs of the local natives, "Eskimo" also unfolds their simple and brave character. They live primitively, and they struggle with nature for survival. They live by hunting. When they have no winter food, they must risk hunting walruses or polar bears. They are a group of people outside the civilized world. They have no sharp weapons, not even a single needle. There are no wars or any grudges between them. They live peacefully and lovingly, and they do not understand all the cunning and hypocrisy of civilized people.</p>
<p>However, precisely because of this, they are regarded as ignorant barbarians by the imperialist white people. So the white people exchange a few boxes of needles or a bird gun for their countless extremely valuable animal skins, and arbitrarily rape their women. However, they can comfort themselves by accepting the wives and daughters of others, but they cannot allow their own wives and daughters to be forcibly raped by civilized people, so they resist and kill the so-called civilized people who are beasts in human form. They do not understand the law, and they do not know what punishment they should receive. When Mala was captured by the civilized people after being deceived, he realized that the white people he had saved were now the executioners who would put him to death. For the sake of freedom and peace, they finally broke free from the shackles of imperialism. The harm they suffered from the white people was to escape in the snow and ice. They would not use the weapons of civilized people to hunt wild animals, so in hunger they had to kill their family dogs to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>Ah! Here, the cunning, hypocrisy, cruelty, and even the true face of all imperialism are exposed. The "Eskimo" people, who are considered savage, must not only work hard to fight against nature, but also escape the harm of so-called civilized people. Here, we are immediately reminded of Pudovkin's "Storm Over Asia." The primitive Mongols were deceived, abused, oppressed, and even inhumanly massacred by imperialists. In the end, the primitive Mongols finally rose up, finally exposed the true face of imperialism, and launched an anti-imperialist war. Similarly, the author of this "Eskimo" did not have a further understanding. All that Van Dyke could do was to describe the lovely life and personality of this primitive group of people with true sympathy. He only knew that they should resist for love, he only satirized the imperialists from the side, and he warmly sympathized with the fate of the barbarians. Until Mala was driven to escape on the melting ice floes, he made the young white man discover his conscience and not put him to death.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we certainly cannot find a director in America like Pudovkin, but having this film is not necessarily a precious treasure among American films. After watching it, in the dialogue, he cursed the so-called civilized people, and he frankly taught the simple "Eskimo" people to hate the British and cut off contact with the civilized people. His sympathy for oppressed nations and his passion for hating imperialism are fully revealed in the picture.</p>
<p>That's right, he is a progressive humanist, and he has a liberal worldview. In this film, even if it is sentimental, he ultimately and greatly unfolds the suffering of the oppressed nations. Who are the barbarians? Please think about it.</p>
<p>To say it again, before a further understanding, all he can do is humanitarian sentimentality. When he finally used the method used by Griffith in "Broken Blossoms" with extremely painful capital letters, he made Mala escape in the snow. Without food, after killing all the family dogs, he fought with the wild wolves again. In order to escape the white man's gallows, he had no choice but to drift with the waves on the melting ice floes with his wife, even to the point of never knowing where they would end up. This sad and painful poetic sentiment undoubtedly deeply stimulated the audience's hearts. Therefore, in terms of directing techniques, the most successful is the grasp of the tone. As for the cleanliness of the picture, the delicacy of each love scene, and the tension of the hunting scene, it can be said to be wonderful to the extreme. Does anyone still think that the mother breastfeeding or Mala's second wife singing bare-breasted is lewd "sensationalism" or "eroticism"? He is good at handling the sound of sound films in the wind, the wailing of dogs on cold nights,... This can be seen here. As for several "Eskimo" actors, such as the male lead who played Mala and the two female leads, they all performed extremely well, especially the male lead when he broke free from the iron chains and when he and his second wife sang in the hut; even more showing the genius of the performance. It is said that these two people have been taken back to Hollywood by Mr. Van Dyke.</p>
<p>In short, this is a very valuable film. I hereby introduce it to the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Review of "Blood Money" <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Blood Money | Nanjing |</p>
<p>"Broadway Bill" is rough, vivid, and has a kind of unrestrained momentum. Although it consciously promotes the imperialist war of aggression, we can see the reality of the lower class society in the United States from it.</p>
<p>"Blood Money" is elegant and ordinary. It describes a love story in a leisurely tone. However, the so-called exposure of the lower class life, apart from some hula dances and decadent music in the nightclub at the beginning, simply cannot see anything.</p>
<p>However, we must admit that there are indeed giants of the lower class society like Bairac in the United States.</p>
<p>He is a rogue who associates with government officials and specializes in bond guarantees for others. His life is playing with women, playing dog racing, and playing golf. He is completely an idler.</p>
<p>Another kind of character is Turell, who specializes in major cases of thieves, but we cannot tell from his appearance.</p>
<p>We cannot find fundamentally different social backgrounds from Bairac and Turell. They are all upper class members of the modern urban lumpenproletariat. Therefore, we can only see their elegant and enjoyable life in "Blood Money," not their rough and wandering life.</p>
<p>However, the love lan ling in "Blood Money" is even more worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The development of American capitalism has reached a point of extreme maturity, and all social upward mobility and progress have stopped, and we can only see its signs of decline, death, and decay, although we should particularly point out a new and energetic factor that is growing there.</p>
<p>The life of the powerful in modern society has therefore reached the highest point of decadence, ordinariness, and ugliness, so the greatest need of all is extraordinary stimulation, and fantasy and curiosity are popular in that lifeless social group.</p>
<p>The emancipation of women in modern society was originally incomplete, but now, women under the deformed social system can no longer be satisfied with sexual pleasure and all other high-level and elegant pleasures, so they have further developed curiosity and fantasy. In the United States, the criteria for women to choose a husband even abandon gentlemen and turn to rogues, which is nothing more than an essence of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The love lan ling is such a woman. From here, we can see the degree of corruption in American society, and the inevitability of the growth and abandonment of this old society by new factors - although the playwright of "Blood Money" will not understand this.</p>
<p>Among the actors, George Bancroft, who left the "film circle" a year ago because he was unhappy with making films that he didn't want to act in, has now rejoined 20th Century Fox. Because of his willingness, what we see on the screen also feels that he is indeed working hard.</p>
<p>The director's technique uses a lot of "crossing," and his messiness is always a little bit undisguised and felt by us.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e176">Empress Catherine SearletEmpress <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Su Mei</p>
<p>Alexei then presented gifts, giving Sophia winter clothing for use in the north, and to Johanna, a portrait of the Russian Empress, inlaid with jewels. Johanna thanked the ambassador on the one hand, and on the other, feeling somewhat annoyed by Sophia's silence, signaled for her to speak. Sophia's rosy face flushed red, and looking at the portrait of the Russian Empress, she asked Alexei, "Did you not bring a portrait of the crown prince?" Duke Alexei laughed and said, "Do you want him to be more handsome than all other men?" Sophia, appearing somewhat embarrassed, said, "Isn't that so?" Alexei said, "Very well, the crown prince is exactly as you hope, or even better. He has a tall stature, like a Greek god. His eyes are as blue as the clear sky, and his hair is as lustrous as ebony. His strength can rival a team of oxen. He is now neglecting food and sleep while waiting for you." Although the Duke spoke eloquently, his eyes seemed to be covered by a layer of black纱, concealing some secret. Sophia's mother instructed her to withdraw, so she politely thanked Alexei and withdrew. As she reached the door, she hesitated for a moment, turned her head, and glanced at the ambassador who had come from afar. Her heart pounded like a startled goose as she rushed upstairs to her bedroom. Once in her room, she took out her 洋囡囡 (foreign doll). She whispered to it, "Sophia Friederike, are you happy? You are getting married, you will have a man. I am your Russian husband, a great Russian Grand Duke, the crown prince. We will be married soon." After she finished speaking, she silently pondered. She immediately felt a sense of dread, causing her brow to furrow. She would be leaving her family, … leaving her beloved father, … leaving her mother, who would certainly return to Prussia after the wedding ceremony, … her nanny Kadul, … her professor Wagner, … and all the life she knew and was accustomed to, … to go to that distant north, a foreign, cold land, … she then thought of the fur coats and hot water bottles, etc., sent by the Russian ambassador, and she felt a chill.
