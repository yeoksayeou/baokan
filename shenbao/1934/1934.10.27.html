<p>僞國煤油專賣</p>
<h3>英美對日抗議</h3>
<p>指爲破壞門户開放</p>
<p>荷蘭亦採同樣行動</p>
<p>日攫奪控制權目的在使燃料自給</p>
<p>（倫敦）　「滿洲國」擬實行煤油專賣之消息旣布、英美兩國政府卽提出、抗議、美政府聲明專賣將損及美國美孚油公司等之利益、且違反開放門户政策並九國公約云、英政府今日由長春英領事及駐東京英大使分别提出抗議、謂專賣實違反九國公約第三條之精神與文字云、聞荷蘭政府日内亦將提出抗議、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日路透電社探悉英政府爲「滿洲國」油業事、現不斷的與日政府接觸、但迄今未接滿意之覆文、當「滿洲國」煤油公司享有專賣權之計畫發表時、英政府卽向日政府提出詰問、八月間英政府復以各種開放門户宣言提告日政府、以期表明此種計畫如果實現、英國將抱甚嚴重之觀念、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美聯社今日自當局方面得悉、國務院因日本擬排擠在日本及「滿洲國」之外國煤油公司、已向日本正式提出抗議、並聞英荷兩國亦已有同樣之抗議、茲悉三國皆通知東京當局、謂日本擬在滿洲設立煤油專賣權一事、實違背中國門户開放政策、三國照會中且促日本政府注意日本與各國所訂條約已屢遭破壞云此項抗議於此際提出、實具特殊意義、因海軍談話方在倫敦進行、而日本擬攫煤油專賣權之最後目的、無非欲使其艦隊所需煤油得以自給耳、英美荷三國之煤油公司已屢申訴　謂彼等在日滿所受待遇不公、關於滿洲方面、則以日人擬獲一種控制之專利、在滿洲銷售一切煤油出產、至於日本方面、則因日本規定外國煤油公司須在油棧隨時屯積存貨、等於各公司已往六個月内銷售之數、油公司稱、此項規定實行之後、各公司須添築油</p>
<p>池、擴大資本、如此卽不能再在日本營業、此間當局向美聯社稱、對於日本方面並不牽涉條約關係、對於滿洲則觀察者以爲此種抗議、可視爲三國政府仍以「滿洲國」爲中國領士、故仍受門户開放原則之束縛、至日本之所以要求各公司存油日本、則此間若干專家以爲苟遇戰爭、日本艦隊可有充分之燃料云（廿五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日方之狡辯</h3>
<p>（東京）　外務省對於英美等國關於統制滿洲石油案之抗議、爲闡明眞相起見、乃以當局談話之形式、於二十六日夕刻發表聲明如左、</p>
<p>關於「滿洲國」之石油統制計畫、已由英美等國向日本政府提出抗議、查此項情報、係最近由英美等國之新聞電報所傳來之消息、其眞相如左、</p>
<p>本年七月二日由英國大使館及七月七日由美國大使館提出非正式備忘錄、均關於滿洲石油公司之設立、及「滿洲國」官憲之石油專賣實施計畫等等、爲探聽兩大使所得情報是否確實起見、同時關於本案開列該大使館之見解、外務省已於八月三日分别給與回答如下、</p>
<p>（一）滿洲石油公司之設立及關於「滿洲國」官憲之石油計畫本體之「滿洲國政府」方針、旣非日本政府所知悉、故日本政府對於此案、處於不便作任何說明之地位、但作爲參考、而記錄日本政府在最近所得之情報、則其大致情形如左、</p>
<p>「滿洲國」根據本年二月二十一日公布之特别法規、設立「滿洲國」法人之滿洲石油公司、查該項法規並未附與該公司以任何獨占權、且關於持有該公司股份者、</p>
<p>該項法規及公司定欵亦未規定任何國籍上之限制、目下「滿洲國」政府鑒於歐洲各國之先例、關於重要產業之石油業統制案制定法律、似尙在考慮中、茲據情報、得悉該項法案之主旨在政府獨占石油販賣、欲達到統制目的、並非將石油之製造及其進口出口均由政府獨占也、又該法案對於上項石油公司關於石油之製造</p>
<p>及其進口入口等等情形、亦未含有給與任何獨占權之規定、再據情報云、「滿洲國」方面之計畫若謂其政府將應販賣之石油全部、均使滿洲石油公司之製品獨占之、所謂上項情形似尙未考慮至此也、</p>
<p>（二）南滿洲鐵道股份公司將向滿洲石油公</p>
<p>司出資、及該石油公司將設工廠於關東州、當係事實、但關於此點、在日本方面</p>
<p>不能認爲發生抵觸任何旣存條約之問題</p>
<p>（三）鑑於以上各情、在日本政府對於日本</p>
<p>資本家「滿洲國」法人之石油公司阻止向其出資、或對於「滿洲國」當局關於石油之某種統制停止其實施、斷不能有所措詞、另一方面在「滿洲國」政府關於購進及販賣石油、對於現在居留該國境内之外國商人、擬盡量考慮其利益、用意至爲明顯、故甚望兩國有利害關係者直接向「滿洲國」方面折衝爲要、</p>
<p>以上係外務省所回答之要領、至於所謂在「滿洲國」之門户開放主義、其意若曰對於某外國不得在通商上給與獨占及排外之特典也、而此次倘在實施石油統制制度之際、該項制度若非對於日本及其他外國人助長其以國籍爲理由之差别待遇、則不得認爲違背所謂門户開放主義、其見解如是云云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>羅斯福政府經濟政策之轉變</h3>
<p>素</p>
<p>美國在羅斯福政權的統治之下。已有二十個月了。在這期間他究曾給華兒街的巨頭們盡了幾多的力量。却是一個疑問。在這全球不景氣的當兒。羅斯福不但不曾挾有起死回生的妙術。而且他的「醫術」亦並未比較他的政敵胡佛高明多少。</p>
<p>每逢羅斯福氏的政策發生劇變的時候。他至少總得發表一次長篇的演說。去說明或辯護他所採的立塲。卽如這次他在全美銀行公會的演說。就把他的經濟政策的新傾向透露出來了。</p>
<p>在這次演說中羅氏切實聲明說。世人批評他的「新政」社會化。實在是出於誤會的。可是我們還記得。約在一年以前。他的主要口號是縮短工時。增加工資。又準照了這些口號而修訂了許多業規。成立了復興行政局。希望因此而提高人民的購買力。以爲工商業　興的先聲。那時從他本人看來。（甚至。從普通美國人看來。）利用這些非常響亮的口號。足以引起一般人的樂觀心理。以爲他的經濟政策確有社會化的趨勢。那知他所眞正幹出來的。却富有右傾的意味呢。這次他在銀行公會。席上居然公開的贊成「百業之牟利。」格外顯出他右傾的色彩來。世人說他的「新政·」社會化。確實是錯了。</p>
<p>羅氏在演詞中表示。以後只有美國政府與銀行採取完全一致的步驟。才可以維持美國的「傳統政策。」本來羅氏在過去的二十個月中。不但已逐漸變做獨佔資本的良友。并曾利用國家財政的力量去挽救許多托拉斯的破產。至於他現。在從新樹立的政策。郤又更進一步了。他默許那些握有實力的銀行。可以由政府的援助。去走向更高度的托拉斯化的境界。而政府亦可由銀行家的援助。在世界經濟恐慌的局面下去求出路。再者。世界軍備競賽一面足以促起軍需工業的市塲擴大。一面足以刺激戰爭危機的展開近數月來。歐洲的糾紛。層出不窮。這些糾紛都足具體的。表示個中危機的成熟。而最近馬賽事變的發生。和英美日海軍軍縮初步談話會議的僵持。又皆特别含有重大的影響。羅斯福雖亦主張和平。但他的和平是武裝的和平。在國際形勢日趨嚴重的今日。更不能不使他感覺有重新修改經濟政策的必要。以便博得華兒街各巨頭的歡心。無怪大家現在又在說。羅斯福向右轉了。</p>

<h3>通過巴拿馬運河</h3>
<p>極秘密中調回太平洋</p>
<p>海軍談判日宣露要點</p>
<p>巴拿馬　美國大西洋與太平洋聯合艦隊今日駛過巴拿馬運河、迅速異常、計艦八十八艘、由加利比海達太平洋、祗需三十九小時、較上次七十一艦由太平洋達加利比海、减少七小時、飛機母艦萊克辛頓號與薩拉土迦號經過運河時駛行最慢、計需十二小時、因船闊幾與迦屯等閘相埓、故曾撞倒燈桿若干、該艦隊刻駛往加州、繼續太平洋之操練、當艦隊駛過運河時、有商船五十一艘被阻暫停、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國艦隊已於今日下午四時三十分全部通過巴拿馬運河、所費時間爲四十二小時、較之上次由太平洋駛至大西洋所費四十七小時、雖减少五小時、惟此次艦數亦减少二十艘、此次美艦隊通過運河之消息係由海軍部在華盛華盛頓宣布、所有隨艦之新聞記者皆依「戰時」條例不准拍發電報、外間均以爲艦隊尙在加利比海操演、須至十一月一日左右始駛返太平洋也、今聞此訊、各界大駭、海軍調遺司令黎夫斯於宣布此項消息之時、不允表示何以事前嚴守秘密、觀察者以爲上次通過之前盡量宣傳、此次嚴守秘密、其間必有關係在也、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦海軍談話、今僅臻開幕之階段、英美代表昨日會談後、日代表今日復與英代表會晤、已宣露其提案之要點、英日海軍專家今日午後曾會同討論技術細則、聞日代表今力求縮减彼等所目爲海軍侵略武器、其次序如下、飛機母艦·戰鬭艦·及裝八吋口徑砲位之萬噸巡洋艦、今主要障碍之一、爲日本目潛艇僅爲防衛的武器、而英國則視此爲最危險的侵略武器、討論之第二階段、爲英美代表之集議、英國現以討論之進行情形隨時通告法意兩國、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）　外務省已接到松平大使關於日代表與英美兩國會談經過之報告、日代表在會議席上專談軍縮案之大綱、英美代表均未滿足、要求提示日政府之具體案、外務省對於英美此種要求、擬爲懇切說明、然因認英美方面先應提出自國軍縮案、擬向英美請求注意此點、如待諒解、則將討論具體問題、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>軍競爭勢所不免、日本擬要求廢棄五·五·三海軍比率而提高其海軍地位、海軍總長史璜生曾爲此一再宣示、如日本增加其海軍比率、則美國將在太平洋屬島設置海軍根據地、其意卽爲美國將在伸出太平洋千一百英里之阿留申羣島及太平洋西南部之關島薩摩亞島闢艦隊根據地、或竟擴大夏威夷及斐律濱之軍港、美國在一個月中已造及將造之軍艦共六十八艘、實爲華盛頓會議以來造艦最大之數量、如六十八艘全部造成、則仍較條約所許之限度少七十八艘、六月中國會已通過建造此七十八艦案、今後每年可望建造二十艘或二十五艘云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<h3>匈外長建議四國訂新公約</h3>

<h3>大阪市之所見（日本通信）</h3>
<p>都市格外發達</p>
<p>社會畸形景氣</p>
<p>日本農村、迭遭旱災（九州方面最厲害）凍災、（北陸地方最兇）加以其副業的蠶絲一類、又受絲價猛跌的影響、收入减少、竟至三萬萬圓日金之多、所以鄕村間特别困苦經濟力的衰落、非常厲害、農民的購買力、差不多快等於客、因此鄕村的人、多數都現出榮養不良的狀况、</p>
<p>可是都市恰與此相反、中流以上、有多少的人感受到對外輸出增加、輕工業進步的恩惠、又有軍事工業的灌漑好像不知道什麽是「不景氣」、總一味的擴張其事業、向前發展、不但產業資本家·金融資本如此、即一般薪俸生活者·和勞工多半都很快活、以爲前途遠大、在無憂慮、祗要不失業、在都市上總很方便所以體格大都很健</p>
<p>康、一個一個都顯出肥滿的形態、甚至他們所使用的牲畜都喂得很好　瘦馬是絕少看見的、正値風水災害之後的大阪、大家都特别忙碌、從事於復興工作、電車·汽車·公共汽車　塞滿了幾條重要街道、充分的表現他工業上進氣槪、</p>
<p>但有一宗引起初來人特别注意的事、即是咖啡</p>
<p>店喫茶店格外多、幾乎每條街平均都有一兩家各喫茶店所用的女招待雖不必潔亮動人、可是都很妖治、豫備吸引客人的、而其喫茶的價格又便宜得出奇、例如一盅咖啡、祗要五錢、（約合銀四分五厘）糽茶亦同、冰琪琳也祗址錢、其餘點心等項、最多也不過二十錢、在喫茶店裏可以聽聽留聲機、無缐電放送、甚至可以和女招待們打鬧解悶、她們也不因此要小賬、在咖啡店裏、不過要求雇主給她開點心錢而已、</p>
<p>如此現象、在社會風習純樸的日本、何以會有這樣多、市面并不十分興盛、其消費餘力、爲什麽有這樣大、素以提倡優良風俗爲職責的日本政府、又何以准許這類事業的存在、我初看見有些不懂後來經多方面的考查和研究、纔略曉得這種關係、</p>
<p>勤儉樸質的風習、從前是　被整個日本社會、現在靑年男女學生、都穿洋裝或很整潔的制服、輕易不容易看見着「和服」的、他們的外套·皮鞋·大槪都很講究磨擦得亮亮的、原來一般社會特别是大都市上因爲生產增加、產業發達、一般消</p>
<p>費也跟着長進、而娛樂的需要、也同時起來、然而產業發達的結果、工塲生涛擴大、家庭制度在經濟上就不容易維持、所以日本男子頗難建立家庭因爲有了家之後、須擔負兩個人以上的生活和將來的子女敎育費、女子則寗願從事於職業生活不肯作家庭主婦、輕工業所用女工、又比較的多、所以婦女大都向職業界狂奔了去、於是男子要求業餘的娛樂、而工業界又不能容納全數的職業婦女、咖啡店。喫茶店、就應男女雙</p>
<p>方需要的運道而生了、</p>
<p>大阪是工業區、工人占人口的多數、日本一般工資并不高、其消費力自然有限、但其需求娛樂、則并不後人、尤其是在百忙中的短時間娛樂、耗費不多、又能略爲鬆弛工作緊張底下的情續、那末　喫茶店就是他們惟一消遣的塲所了、（十月二十日於東京）</p>

<h3>川剿匪會議席上劉湘之演說詞</h3>
<p>過去辭職乃因於環境困難</p>
<p>軍民旣開誠相見當再勉力</p>
<p>成都通信川省剿匪軍事近來各軍由守轉攻、迭獲勝利、人心漸趨安定、各軍領袖、均有懇切表</p>
<p>示、願竭力以　　氛、劉湘由一度會議後、决於二十二日正式復任四川剿匪總司令職、川局遵　一新氣象、近日軍事方面消息、徐匪送受挫</p>
<p>折　匪則被川軍力剿已　不成股、　匪　川黔湘聯軍仓剿、人槍損失逾半、覆亡在即、至此</p>
<p>次川省軍民聯席之剿匪會議、結果甚佳、實爲剿匪形勢轉佳之一大關鍵、各軍代表發言、均表示尊重團結精神、服從劉湘命令、以促成統一、劉湘亦有極况痛之演說、對辭職經過·及財政辦法·團務問題·諸大端均諭及、頗關重要、爰將其講詞、節錄如下、</p>
<p>劉氏首謂「今日與諸君相聚一堂、個人深爲慚愧、良以個人身負全川剿匪重任、年餘以來、對於剿匪軍事、不善運用、以致九仞之切、虧於一簣、不但深負中央倚畀之殷、川民期望之切、即對個人剿匪志願、亦頗疚心、自覺來日大難、證之過去事實、决非綿力所能勝任、故於八月下旬、决然引咎自責、辭去本　各職、以謝川民、在個人當時下此决心　純爲避位　賢、蓋四川匪息、雖限於川東北一隅、但若川中軍民力盡氣絕、勢必至於潰决、不可收拾、此責一嚴重問題不可自我而誤、</p>
<p>劉氏次謂顧個人辭職、决非愛護一身、實因過去環境太困難、雖竭盡心力、亦無法盡其職責、如關於剿匪計劃、雖有種種規定而以指臂示靈之故、實行照辦者、不及十之三四、財政方面、年餘以來、僅向民衆方面籌集四百萬元、杯水車薪、何能濟事、但個人深知民間疾苦、敬能强自支持、决不願加重人民負擔、故在過去期中、由二十一軍帽鹽稅及各項稅收向商民抵借之欵、已達九百萬、現在連子金不下一千五百萬、羅掘至此不特目前汗乾力盡、即二十一軍兩三年來之餉糈、亦已虚懸無着、反觀剿匪軍事、預計數月能結束者、現復將延至一年以上、士兵枵腹於前綫、人民啼號於後方無米之炊、巧婦難爲、故中央雖迭電慰勉有加、對於整飭紀綱、布層軍事、恋多所指示、而個人始終未敢承命、良以財政問題、無切實辦法也、嗣以余雖辭職、亦屬川民一份子、愛川愛國、豈敢後人、故於赴開江穩定前綫之後、順應各方要求、以私人資格　重返省門、說明辭職苦衷、籍與諸君共商挽回危局之策、日來各方交換意見、及今日諸君所提議案、皆能切合事機、見諸實行、川局前途、不難重見曙光、個人佩慰之餘、益感前此負責　狀、但以今日軍民共聚一堂、開誠相見、矯過去之積弊、策成效於</p>

<p>國民社云、本市新生活運動促進會、據市公安局局長文鴻恩氏建議、改革禮俗辦法、經第三次幹事會議修正通過、一致推行、茲探錄其原文云、案我國以禮敎爲立國之本、惟相習旣久、繁文遞增、寖失本意、遂有觚不觚之歎、延至今日、習俗日　踞、禮之一字、不但變爲虚文、而錢與時間、無端浪費、至可歎息、際茲勵行新生活運動中、誠宜有以改之、爰就其普通習見者、分條列之、俾與吾同志互相勗勉、觀感所及、庶足爲壤土涓流之助云爾、</p>
<p>（甲）婚禮　按婚禮所以表示男女雙方之結合、告於親族知交而已、原毌須過事舗張、昔在帝制時代、儀仗所以表示官階、今官吏之儀仗已廢、更無假借之可能、是儀仗在所必廢之列、酌用宮燈引導、或尙有取義、但亦不必過多、至於喜酒大尤可不必　賀客爲觀禮而來、豈徒舗餟也哉、酌備茶點可矣、鬧新房尤爲陋俗、通都大邑已廢止、姑勿論矣、（一婚禮之喜帖、先期發送、但非親舊知交、不得濫發、（二）不設喜酒、酌備茶點、但辦事人員、得備便餐、（三）廢除一切儀仗、但得用引導之燈籠、（四）樂隊自九人以至三十二人、（五）結婚禮以二小時爲率、（六）賀客應依照規定之時刻凖時到賀、（七）新郎新娘、宜服普通常禮服、但必須用中國國產之質料製造之、</p>
<p>（乙）喪禮　喪禮以哀戚爲主、凡哀悼死者、弔唁、生者、須各視其關係而定、即與生者相識、則唁慰之、與死者相識、則哀悼之、旣曰唁悼曰、更無心於食、故孔子食於有喪者之側、未嘗飽也、是不能不食之時、尙不能飽、豈有臨棺靈前一哭之時、乃可大吃其酒食之理乎、（一）往弔之時間、宜在上午、以凖喪家通知之時間爲率、（二）喪家不設酒食但辦事人得備使餐、（三）訃告不得濫發、以親舊知交爲限、（四）訃告不得列叙前清官銜、及無謂之象贊、（五）如有宗敎關係、須諷經齋奠者、以一日爲限、（六）舉殯時除樂隊影亭燈籠火把外、不得用其他儀仗、（七）其有功黨國或爲社會所崇仰、已有特定之儀式者、不在此限、</p>
<p>（丙）壽禮　壽之一字、至少須在五十歲以上、今乃有二三十歲者、亦大做其壽、然則顏子三十二歲而卒、不得稱爲短命矣、豈非不通之至、更有做冥壽者、其不通更甚、夫人旣死曰壽終、旣壽終矣、更安得言壽乎、故生人稱壽、宜有限制、若冥壽則亟宜痛行革除、以杜招搖科歛之惡習、（一）凡子弟爲長上稱壽者、在所不禁、惟至少應以五十歲爲始、不及五十者不得稱壽、（二）壽筵每桌不得過八元、（三）可設僕席、不得發給車飯資、（四）不得徵妓侑酒、（五）壽筵時間以二小時爲率、（六）祝壽者不得過午後始往祝、（七）祝壽者以鞠躬爲禮、不得沿用跪拜、（八）壽帖不得濫發、以親友知交爲限（九）絕對廢止做冥壽、但家屬追祭不在此限、</p>
<p>（丁）冥會　按宴會之禮、始於祭祀分胙、不敢獨享、故必與親友共之、使子弟因以明長幼之序、</p>
<p>習進退之節、故内地請酒宴客、皆有一定之時節、若春酒·年酒·元宵酒·端節·清明·祭墳·等等、大率皆因祭祀而後、宴及親友、是猶存古義、</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>所謂士無故不殺鷄、必有祭祀乃可殺牲、現今上海每於舊歷歲幕暮、請親友吃年夜飯、其餚饌、大率皆祭祀所用物品、亦是此意、至酒　茶館生涯發達宴客之事、亦日多、有故則請客、無故亦請客、而且豪侈丰尙、一席數十元、習爲常事、長幼之序、進退禮節、一切不請、紛然而集、閑談笑謔、食畢鬨然而散、禮之一字、早已消失無存、且於時間漫無一定、午餐或至未後入席、晚餐或至戌亥入席、候客往往二三小時以上、耗時傷財、莫此爲甚、茲擬酌爲限制於左、（一）無故不得宴會、（二）宴會之餚饌、每桌不得過八元、（三）宴會時間以二小時爲率、（四）被邀請之客、必凖時蒞止、否則不候、（五）僕從不得發車飯資、（六）不得徵妓侑酒、（七）一切設備應從儉樸、</p>
<p>（戊）送禮　送禮者、俗曰人情、又曰禮尙往來、故世俗往往查對以前所受者若干、而即以其相當之禮以爲報施、此亦不通之甚、夫旣曰人情、則</p>
<p>重在情而不在物、習俗趨於奢侈諂佞、乃有藉送禮以達其獻媚之手段者、可恥孰甚、天虚我生主張送禮燭爲宜、取其能化除室中之一養化炭爲二養化炭、祓除不祥、較有意義、又有謂昔時鄕村間人情致餽不過三錢四錢之銀、若至六錢、可爲厚餽、甚有數百靑銅錢者、今縱不能與昔相比、然酌中定限、以四元爲最多類、庶受者不傷廉、送者不傷惠、因爲酌擬限制於下、一、凡婚喪壽等事送禮以燭劵禮劵及物品三種爲限、二、燭券劵以一斤起至五斤爲止、三、禮劵及物品最多至四元爲止、四、月薪自一百元之至二百元以下者餽送禮物、至多以二元爲限、五、月薪在二百元以上者、餽贈禮物至多以四元爲限、六、物品以國產而切於實用者爲限、七、凡素不相識者、雖請柬、不得送禮、」如有違及以上五項各條之規定者、以違背公約論、</p>

<p>中國興業銀行公訴案審訊</p>
<h3>債權人紛往聽審</h3>
<p>庭内已無隙地後至者鵠立庭外</p>
<p>陸錫侯運用存户資金極不正當</p>
<p>銀行牽倒係受國際賽馬會影響</p>
<p>買賣人造絲黑幕重重眞相畢露</p>
<p>中國興業銀行倒閉、經理秦抱元、先期逃逸、常務董事陸錫侯、則於事後被捕房偵查得侵占詐欺背信等情、依據刑法三百六十三及三百六十六條、向第一特區地方法院提起公訴、業經將陸拘案、訊押第一特院、並以該銀行債權人近有紛紛向法院掁訴者、以爲對於辦案程序及時間、俱不經濟、决仰該債權人等、如欲進行訴訟、着投承辦是案之總巡捕房報告、由捕</p>
<p>房亦予公訴、併案審理、較爲便利、均已迭誌本報、昨日下午、爲公訴案開庭之期、該銀行債權人赴第一特院三樓第一刑庭旁聽者、</p>
<h3>紛至沓來</h3>
<p>至午後二時、庭内旁聽席已無隙位、後至者遂皆鵠立庭外、頗形擁擠、俄而錢鴻業庭長升座飭將陸錫侯·孫希仁·兩被告提案、捕房起訴律師汝葆彝·兩被告之辯護律師吳麟坤·范剛·等五人、亦同時出席、先由汝律師陳述本星期一開審後繼續調查之經過情形、曁追加控告陸錫侯之案由、略謂、在本案改期中、捕房又查得被告陸錫侯、於本年間在中國興業銀行所辦理各事實、多有離常軌、以致社會間有甚多人士、被其騙入存欵者匪尠、日來此類受騙之人、咸紛紛投捕房報告、捕房正在搜集、</p>
<h3>切證據</h3>
<p>惟究有若干數額、須由會計師調查、始能知其確數、陸錫侯乃該銀行負責者、該銀行之營業情狀、以及組織手續、俱有顯背銀行法第四十六七八等條之規定、而該銀行於本年又另設一儲蓄部、但其並未預向財政部註册、請領儲蓄業務之執照、亦屬違背儲蓄銀行管理法第十六條之規定、是以今特依據以上兩種法規、對陸追加控訴、至於證人、今已傳到數名均可證明、該銀行内容極腐敗、所吸入之欵項、胥用於不正當之途、此外捕房復查明該銀行有若干人員祗担任空名義、每月各支車馬費百金、旣</p>
<h3>不問行事</h3>
<p>更不知行中内容、惟今日訊問後、仍請求延期、蓋捕房還須繼續偵查也、庭上卽傳證人邵鳳山訊據供稱、在大生昌洋雜貨號担任買人造絲職務、該號係新華貿易公司之附屬品、並專任經理、一切行爲、均應聽新華貿易公司經理孫希仁指揮、大生昌創立於本年八月二十九日、我前本在新華服務、嗣被調至大生昌、而大生昌每次購進之人造絲、則槪交新華出售、購時所付價金、係用大生昌支票、向中國興業銀行所換之本票、此項換票手續、由孫希仁與該銀行接洽、非我能知、而人造絲轉賣得之價欵、</p>
<h3>作何用途</h3>
<p>亦非我所悉、此次三井之人造絲、亦係我經買、大生昌停業之後、所用賬簿、我已於九月二十六日、交與孫希仁收管、新華公司乃秦抱元·孫希仁·及姚某·等股開、我曾因秦將購進之絲以賤價售出、欵而詰之、據秦云因陸錫侯所辦之國際賽馬會、需欵孔多、均係銀行墊付、致銀行頓覺空虚、週轉不靈、故設此策、俾得現金、以資挹注云云、繼訊據證人李興凱供、在大生昌任買絲職務、邵鳳山係該號經理、據邵言號主乃秦抱元、我先在新華貿易公司服務、該公司買賣人造絲、槪由邱姓經手、貨皆存於</p>
<h3>秦抱元家</h3>
<p>中、而由新華貿易公司代賣、至大生昌則係九月二十五號收歇、是日方知秦抱元已逃、而邵鳳山亦忽不歸店、並突有陸·周·秦·等三人來店查問貨物賬目、我乃將此情形往報孫希仁云云、質之被告陸錫侯供稱、我係羣益銀團董事、羣益銀團乃我與高恩洪·殷澤生·等三人組織、於廿一年從孫丹林手接辦、銀團墊資本十五萬元、我認半數、高殷共認半數、舉殷爲總理、嗣因殷挪用巨欵五萬餘金、遂於去年六七月間歸我獨辦、增添資金十五萬、繼續持、庭上卽詰以曾否組織董事會、有無董事、董事名額若干、</p>
<h3>姓甚名誰</h3>
<p>陸對此點所答殊含混、國際跑馬會係本年五月創立、資本五十萬、我承認半數爲二十五萬、大體已付足、餘半數股欵、則係西人承認、庭上命其將認股人名發表、陸祗書示一人之名、並續稱該會係向美國註册、賬簿皆在西人手、大生昌號初不知由秦開設、至其買賣人造絲付出興業銀行本票等事、我事前亦毫未悉、及秦逃逸、始造周少彭等三人往大生昌調查等語、又訊據被告孫希仁供稱、新華貿易公司、於本年四月初設立、股東乃秦抱元及姚某、股本爲六千元、原定與</p>
<h3>法國人</h3>
<p>合作、但公司成立、該法人尙未到滬、故初祗略做紗布交易、邵鳳山係由秦抱元薦至公司、而邱某則係我所介紹、公司開始做人造絲、約在五六月間旋因無利可圖、卽停止該項買賣、至八月間、秦抱元復着繼續經營、據秦謂中國興業銀行已至空虚狀態、危險異常、彼身膺經理、應設法維持、購買人造絲、旣可以十天期票作代價、大可收購、一方卽速賣出、藉此現欵、以作週轉、倘能維持至跑馬會開幕、則行中經濟、當有辦法云云、秦旣具維持銀行之苦心、我復係僱用、自應就能力所及、加以恊助、於是卽着手</p>
<h3>買人造絲</h3>
<p>隨買隨賣、愈速愈善、故初時甚有關進出迅速、賬簿亦不及記載者、厥後我覺長此以往、必致無從稽考、且此際與公司合作之法國人已到、恐有不便、而經手之邱姓、復不願獨任買賣之勞、我乃與秦磋商之下、始决另設一大生昌號、專負進貨之責、而新華則任售貨之職、分工合作、至賣出絲價、完全由秦付交銀行、間亦有解交元記（卽秦抱元）或大生昌者、新華公司内有賬可查、詎至中秋節夕、秦在某旅館與我談、彼對銀行原擬維持至中秋、不料今仍無辦法、行内當局、欲</p>
<h3>檢查賬目</h3>
<p>故依然不了、我遂詢以購人造絲事、陸錫侯究竟知否、秦謂陸當然知悉、否則焉能發出本票、惟邵鳳山今供大生昌賬簿已交我收、殊非實在、蓋我對大生昌並無職務、但當秦抱元逃避大生昌收歇之際、我曾囑李興凱轉致該號司賬謝姓、將</p>
<h3>一切賬據</h3>
<p>妥愼保管、謝聞已返朱家閣原籍、我爲此事、業在押所致函謝戚陸某、着通知謝連行來滬對質、諒謝必親前來、則此點當能明瞭云云、次由陸之辯護律師發言、對邵鳳山大加攻擊、指大生昌係邵與秦抱元等串同虚設、盜取中國興業銀行之本票、騙購貨物、面嫁禍於人、主犯反逍遙法外、並請求准陸交保、錢庭長以該行倒欠各欵、未經查明實在情形之前、被告所請、應予駁回、諭仍還押候再續訊、</p>

<h3>綏遠印象</h3>
<p>許振華</p>
<p>溯自東北淪亡，國人視綫即移注西北，開發西北之呼聲日高，惟西北地域旣廣，蘊藏又富，開發工作，要非一朝一夕所能成就·而當地人民因受歷年天災人禍，已顚沛流離，困苦萬狀，吾人於談開發西北之先，尤應注意改良西北之社會，救濟西北之農村，掃除民族間一切隔膜，改進遊牧人民之生活數點，茲就記者數月來在綏遠各地觀察所得，公表如下，想亦爲關心西北者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>（一）包頭一帶之鴉片，娼妓，土匪。鴉片，爲綏遠社會之三大致命傷，以包頭一縣論，鴉片之普遍，有甚於紙烟，全城商店計一千一百十四家中，而烟館竟有百餘所，大街小巷，隨處可見紅紙方燈之烟館標幟，或書留香室，或書安樂窠，更有書種種滑稽對聯，例如「此中自有佳趣，以外不知所云」，一本地土吸幾口多加精神，要快樂最好處明燈一遠一等，光怪離奇，名目不一，馬路上販賣鴉片烟具之小販，多不勝計，吸食者則以本地人佔多數，上至縉紳，下至苦力，莫不圁帶烟容，記者曾於草棚中見一乞丐，身披兩塊老羊皮，斜臥泥汚中，亦在呑雲吐霧，詢其生活，則謂每日行乞所得銅元一二十枚，以半數作烟資，以半數供膳食，間亦有仁人君子，以鴉片作布施者，故尙不致作鴉片餓鬼耳，綏省鴉片流毒，於此可見一斑。細察鴉片盛行原因，一方面固在積習已深，革除匪易，另一方面，亦因政府之收捐圖利，有以致之，查包頭一縣，一年田賦僅八千元，而各項雜稅達八萬元，其中即以鴉片捐娼妓捐兩者爲大宗，烟稅徵收方法，農民種一畝地之鴉片，先由禁烟稽查處徵收地畝稅二十元，至生土出賣成交時，再收落地稅每畝二角，共二十元二角，至於開設烟館，則所徵各稅項目甚多，最小烟館，每月應納稅計禁烟善後局六元，財務局二元，地產局二元，公安局二元，印花局四元，商會費一元三角二分，營業稅一元六角七分，共十八元九角九分，此外尙有妓燈捐，良房燈捐等，捐稅重重，按寓禁於徵之意，鴉片氣燄，當可稍戢，惟事實上，農民仍多種植，商人仍多販賣，蓋耕種五榖，良田每畝收穫最多二十元，如種鴉片，則能產土百兩，每兩以六角計，即有六十元，除稅捐外，尙餘四十元，較種五榖，利過其半，至設烟館，大約每二元五角之烟土，可售三元，除捐稅外，利雖至薄，但以吸食者衆多，終不難於多中取利也。與鴉片有密切之關係者爲娼妓，包頭係西北商業交通之總匯，娼妓數目，尤堪驚人，一般行脚商，來往各地，以數年辛苦經營之所得，往往不惜於包頭之花街柳巷中，作一二月之揮霍，包頭官妓，分爲四等歸軍警憲聯合稽查處管理，頭二等居平康里，捲髮革履，服裝入時·三四等居大定襄巷一帶土房中，服式奇形怪狀，無所不有，顧客多爲貧民苦力，其捐稅亦按等級分納，計有妓捐，妓門捐，妓燈捐，良房燈捐，稽查費等名目，妓門捐頭等每户每月二十一元六角，二等十六元八角，三等十元八角，三等以下，則無門娟</p>
<p>妓捐頭等每名每月二元四角，二等一元八角，三四等及靑妓均一元二角，妓燈捐係抽妓女之烟燈捐，頭二三等妓女每人均備有一烟燈供客，頭等抽捐每月十一元二角，二等八元四角，三等五元六角，所謂良房燈捐，則係指官妓下班之後，在自已家中，偶有熟客來訪，其所設之供客烟燈，亦須抽捐，頭二等每月每名七角，三四等五角，稽查費頭等每月每名一元一角</p>
<p>，二等一元，三四等八角，綜計全縣妓捐收入，年可八千元，公娼之外，又有私娼，俗稱破鞋，街巷中有衣式略爲入時，態度略帶風駁者，比比皆是也。綏遠窮荒，而娼妓之所以能盛行不替者，考其原因，約有三端，一由於人民生計艱難，贍養妻女不易，而一般婦女，又乏生產能力，於是迫而爲娼，二由於盜匪横行，旦夕數驚，農村中婦女不能安居，相率避入城市，而城市中謀生更難，貧窮婦女，捨賣淫而外，别無生路，三由社會風氣所致，包頭一帶，漢蒙雜處，蒙人男女，並無禮俗防嫌，漢人亦多受其影響，貞節廉恥觀念，甚爲淡薄，男女離合，亦極自由，男子在外經商一二年不歸者，其妻即可任意改嫁，此種改嫁婦女，俗稱活人妻。至於土匪，一則因過去政局混亂，散兵爲匪，一則因民生凋弊，生活艱難，一般狡黠者流，類多鋋而走險，自傅作義氏主綏以來，雖竭力征剿，終難肅清，鄕野中，行人商旅爲之裹足，惟匪最懼蒙人，蓋蒙人精於騎射，百米之内，拔鎗鳴中，雖孤虎荒野中之一二蒙古包，匪亦不敢侵犯，以是包頭行商多請求各蒙旗王公爲之保護，而各王公亦因之而大做其</p>
<p>保鏢生意，自包頭至寗夏駝隊，凡派蒙兵保護者，每一駝收費五角，中途出險，則照貨價如數賠償。以上所述爲包頭一帶及綏遠全省之普遍情形也。（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解　零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜去訪貧</p>
<p>胡嫂子道：瞎你說，這可是不得了。偏是我們這樣的人，倒有整大羣的親戚來找我們。老爺你來瞎！不要緊的，屋子鬼髒得很，你就在我們院子裏坐坐好了。他們這樣說着話時，那姑娘本來已經是走進屋子裏去了的。這時可就扶了那扇繩子栓綁的木板門，伸出半邊臉來，向這裏張望着。向這裏張望着。及至志前向他看時，立刻向後一縮。志前想着，舊式姑娘，總是這種情景。要看人，又怕人看。這倒怪有趣的，於是情不自禁的微微一笑。當他這樣笑着，那姑娘恰好又伸出半邊臉來。見人家笑了，他也就跟着笑。你看他雖是由甘肅來的人，究竟是湖南原籍，還不脫江南人那種秀媚的樣子，露出整齊而又雪白的牙齒，不失爲可愛，况是他那黑白分明的眼珠，又是向旁邊一轉呢。於是回轉臉來向胡嫂子道；那姑娘就是你的親戚了。他姓什麽？胡嫂子道：他姓朱，名字還是很好聽，呌月英。志前心想，這也是普通女孩子呌爛了的名字。於是跟着這個意思，又微微的笑了。胡嫂子見他連笑了兩次，無論如何，這是有點意思的了。便走向前一步道：請坐坐罷，我們不過和你說幾句話，决不要什麽。志前也有點心裏搖動了，便道：已好，你們總說日子怎樣的苦，我倒要到你們家去看看，究竟是怎麽個樣子的苦法。其實，他心裏想着，這女孩子怪可憐的，也値得深深的考查一下。（五○）</p>
<h3>疲倦的舞娘</h3>
<p>— 黄克</p>
<p>每夜，每夜，總是把一顆寂寞的心去浸在刺激味的酒杯裏，找一隻幽暗的角落悄悄地坐着讓爵士音樂麻醉了我的神經。每夜，每夜，當默默的沉思的時候，一串小金鈴的聲響老是打醒我的沉思，抬起頭來，一個娘兒剛打我邊兒輕飄的走過，仔細的瞧瞧：嘻，又是伊，那麽孤獨的，疲倦的舞娘呵！來的時候總是在奏過二三支曲子以後，悄悄地走到靠邊兒那把椅子上坐下了，打開手提袋來照照鏡了，掠一掠灣頭髮，掏出粉盒子來塗了一點粉，再把那發膩的嘴唇染上一抹口紅：然後抽一支烟，黑貓牌的淡淡的烟味在伊的媚黎型的小巧的臉上畫了一片霧，像一朶淋着曉雨的睡蓮呵。</p>
<p>音樂一起來，燈光暗啦：那些穿槳褶白襯衫的，擺在闊領帶上的臉兒都扮着笑勁兒，摟着舞娘們轉進光滑的地板去啦！在音樂的旋律上，吾瞧見伊那麽疲倦地伏在那蓄着貓式鬍子的中年紳士的懷抱裏，高跟鞋兒有規律地旋轉着：大銅鼓鼕鼕的一聲兒，電燈亮了，人們各自回到原位上，吾又看見伊二支手兒托着下巴，半閉起眼珠子，寂寞地抽着一支淡味的烟，很疲倦的樣子呢！</p>
<p>第二支曲子飄起來的時候，我便搶到伊的面前，摟着伊在爵士樂上轉着，轉着。</p>
<p>同樣是給生活担子壓碎了心兒的寂寞的人兒呵！一朶像淋着曉雨的蓮花在我的懷抱裏悄悄地睡着啦。</p>
<h3>滴點</h3>
<p>— （怡怡館主）</p>
<p>人是成於點滴，這一點一滴，是「精蟲」和「卵子」。</p>
<p>文人的文章，也是成於點滴，這一點一滴，是「心血」各「腦汁」。</p>
<p>女人的金錢，是耗於點滴，這一點一滴，是「口脂」和「香水」</p>
<p>貧官汚吏的資財，是積於點滴，這一點一滴，是「民脂」和「民膏」。</p>
<h3>茶話</h3>
<p>— 仲寅</p>
<p>我國產茶：最著名者，稱武夷茶：武夷茶之茶名，分四等；武夷茶之茶品，亦分四等，書齋寂靜，不染一塵，手執一杯，細細領略，眞覺清沁齒牙，香留肺腑，非但驅睡魔，亦足以增詩興也！茲述如下：</p>
<p>武夷茶之茶名：一曰花香，等而上之曰小種，再等而上之曰名種，又等而上之曰奇種，花香：城中官府，及豪富人家尙之，小種：山中視爲常品，名種：山下不易得，泉州厦門人所講工夫茶，（磁壺，泥罏，炭火，泉水，色色講究；初沸，次沸，三沸，烹法極精，廣東潮州人，亦尙之，）號稱名種，實僅小種，奇種：山中亦不易得，有雪梅木瓜諸名：大約茶樹與梅花相近者，卽引得梅花之味：與木瓜相近者，卽引得木瓜之味，他可類推必須得山中之水，方能發其精英！</p>
<p>武夷茶之茶品：　一日香：如花香小種之類。等而上之曰清：香而不清，猶凡品也，再等而上之曰甘：清而不甘，則苦茗也。又等而上之曰活：香而不活，不過好茶而已。活之一字，須從舌本辨之。亦必須得山中之水，方能悟此消息！</p>
<p>以上所稱茶名：茶品：陸羽茶經，未及備載。福州森越亭武夷雜詩：「他時詫朋輩，眞飲至漿回。」非身到山中，親書仙液，不能道此語！可見茶之色，香，味，俱全，而尤需乎泉，而尤賴乎煎，世有盧仝，不難索得解人也！</p>
<h3>流浪人的病態</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>百元存欵百年期</h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>任何行業，都有優待顧客的辦法。舊時三百六十行中，只有開「子曰店　的學究先生，除却門前貼着「家有塾」的紅紙條兒以外再也没有什麽招徠生徒的方法了。但是聽得老輩講起一椿笑話，據說：有兩個私塾相距不遠，彼此都要拉攏生徒，當然要想出一個優待顧客的辦法，凡是生徒來塾讀書，如·遇天雨·先生一定設法把學生䭾送回家，他在紅紙條邊，另貼了一張「落雨包䭾送」的廣告，果然生徒鼎盛，濟濟盈門，另一家私塾受了影響，他便進一層的優待顧客，不但天雨䭾送，便是天晴也肯䭾送，於是貼出一張「天晴亦䭾送」的廣告，以爲抵制，於是濟濟生徒，又舍彼而就此了。</p>
<p>近來，有一部分銀行界學得此訣，非但利息從優，而且附有贈品，已從「落雨包䭾送」而進至「天晴亦䭾送」的程度，這眞是顧客的特别便宜了？有一位某同學，他是某銀行經理的兒子，他曾出一個問題：「現在銀行界最優惠的利息，大槪滿足五年，可以對本對利，假如存洋百元，五年一結，繼續生息，到了百年滿足，本利該得若干？諸君不用思索，儘可隨口答覆。」於是，有猜數千元的，有猜數萬元的，有放膽的答覆，猜至數十萬元的，這般的猜測博得某同學搖頭不止。</p>
<p>最後，人家問他究有若干本利？某同學說：滿了百年，任憑資本雄厚的銀行，也只好把銀行一古腦兒送給這家百元的存户。</p>
<p>人家聽了，表示不信。某同學說：一經布算，便明白了，存欵百元，五年一加倍，滿了十年，本利便有四百元。滿了三十年，本利便有六千四百元。滿了五十年，本利便有十萬零二千四百元，滿了八十年，本利便有六百五十五萬三千六百元，滿了一百年，本利共該一萬零四百八十五萬七千六百元，照這麽說只怕僅把一家銀行送給他，還不够支付這百元存户的本息呢！</p>
<h3>談漢文正楷</h3>
<p>— 謝一鷗</p>
<p>我國文字溯自倉頡造字以來，獸蹄鳥迹，蝌蚪鐘鼎，秦篆，漢隸，隨時改進，而一以便用美觀爲歸。及正楷字出，乃告大成。蓋其字體端正，筆姿秀美，運用便利，卽爲我民族所認爲最適用之字體，自晋迄今，數千年來，凡我民族之識字習書者，無不識之習之，奉爲正則。明清科舉，且以爲殿試去取之標準。在印刷方面言，宋元古籍，凡世家刻本，其精美者，類用正楷字體。元明以來，世家精槧，亦往往用正楷字體。惟一般俗工，不通書法者，乃妄自刻鵠，轉輾傳習，因成似隸非隸似楷非楷之一體，卽今所謂「明體」，普通亦謂之「老宋體」。自明以來，坊問習用，幾成爲我國雕版印刷上所專用之字體，致我國書寫之字體，截然分離，其於發楊文化普及敎育已覺諸多隔膜，自近世印刷工業採用機器後，日本人將「明體」字翻製銅模，輸入我國，我國機器印刷之有明體銅模，實由日本人供給之。其勢力日漸占據我國書報機關，文化侵略之横來，能無寒心。</p>
<p>海上文藝界鉅子李祖韓鄭午昌陳小蝶等，有感於斯，籌集鉅資，創製漢文正楷活字版。自頭號至六號，均已出齊，設立印刷廠，鑄字試印，三年以來，承印書籍文件大小達二十五萬種。如鐵道年鑑，全國鹽政實錄，全國銀行年鑑等巨集，皆以此種正楷活字排印。成績之美，已得各界相當之認識。而全國印刷同業採用漢文正楷鉛字印刷者，亦達三百五十餘家矣。</p>
<p>茲聞該局爲發揚固有文化，改進現代印刷起見，願將參淡經營辛苦創製之漢文正楷活字版，除仍發售鉛字外，并翻製銅模發售，使全國印刷同業共得購用之，以增益其營業。倘此種占有我國過去文化史二千年重要之地位而仍爲我現代四萬萬民族所適用之正楷字，經同業多數採用，其勢力遽能光復被日製明體在我印刷業上之領域，其有功於我國文化敎育之前途，寗有涯涘耶！（却酬）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>還有一部份是已够資格的，照理原該先上車站去接駕，却因那時候恰好有十分緊要的職務，不能離開自已的衙門；這兩批人便一起趕到御道旁邊來，給太后叩頭，非是補行接駕禮的意思。</p>
<p>雖說這幾百名的滿洲兵是給懷塔布調來護衛太后的，但他們此刻已算是進了禁城了在禁城内除了御林軍之外，别的隊伍本是不能走進去的，現在他們雖已從擁走了進去，但兵器是絕對不許帶的。讀者試想：這種情形，究竟爲難不爲難？他們此來的任務，雖說是爲着要保護太后，這就是說，萬一有什麽不幸的事情，臨到了太后的身上的話，他們都得直接負責，然而又不准他們帶兵器，難道好敎他們赤手空拳的去抵擋刺客或叛黨？這不是存心和他們下不去嗎！但我們儘可無須爲他們着忙，因爲那時候，中國人備有手槍或炸彈一類的東西的還不多，如有人要行刺太后的話，少不得依舊用刀劍，單用刀劍，就不容易在這麽許多人的中間行事了；所以事實上，是决不會有什麽亂子發生的！懷塔布之所以要調這幾百名旗兵來的意思，與其說是他存心要保衛太后，還不是說他存心要討好太后的來得確當。</p>
<p>當我坐着轎子，穿過那城門的時候，我還是照着老規矩，拉開了一些轎簾，竭力偷看着外面的景緻；因此很清楚地看見這一座皇城的城牆上，已有許多剥蝕斑駁的舊磚頭，吊落在地下了，也有不少是有人私下去拆毁的。而且因爲久已無人去修整的緣故，以致亂草叢生，全失了應有的莊嚴氣象。（一六○）</p>

<h3>直流萬能電表</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>無論修理，製造，測騐一切無綫電機，準確的電表，實是不可須臾或離的儀器，但是測量電壓有弗打表，測量電流有安培表或千分安培表，測量電阻有歐姆表，且每種電表所能測量的範圍大小，亦各不同，如果要將種種電表，逐一備齊，自非我們業餘研究者經濟能力所能及，幸而各種電表的功且雖不同，其構造實完全類似，所異者僅副件的配合有别，所以一種電表，可化作多種用法，本文的萬能電表，祗用一只０—１直流千分安培表配以最簡單的副件，無論電壓—電流，電阻，均可極精確的測得，備此一具，一切無綫電機上的難題，自可迎刃而解矣。</p>
<p>一電壓測量　以此表測量電壓，應接在註明「電壓」兩接頭上，SW１須關斷，分綫鑰SW2應旋至IMA處，然後轉動ＳＷ３至適當範圍，電阻Ｒ１Ｒ２Ｒ３爲倍値器Ｍultiplier以分别電壓範圍的大小，其數値可依下列公式求之</p>
<p>例如Ｒ１爲一萬歐姆，電壓範圍可量至十弗打：Ｒ２爲十萬歐姆，可量至一百弗打，Ｒ３爲一百萬歐姆，可量至一千弗打ＣＳＷ３在ＩＯＶ處電表的指數，應乘以十，餘類推。</p>
<p>二電流測量　測量電流時應接在「電流」兩接頭上，ＳＷ１仍須關斷，旋轉ＳＷ２至適當範圍，電阻Ｒ４Ｒ５Ｒ６爲與電表並聯的支流器Ｓhunt其數値雖亦有公式可求，但萬難準確，困其電阻極小，且不可稍差分毫，大約電流範圍擴大十倍，支流器電阻僅爲電表本身電阻的十分之一，餘類推，所以最好另以一精確的千分安培表，與之串聯於一電路内，</p>
<p>以隨割隨試法Ｃut　and　Ｔry校正之，最須注意者，ＳＷ２如未與適當的支流器接觸完密時，切不可接入電路内測量，否則將有燒燬之虞。</p>
<p>三電阻測量　此表測量電阻的綫路，係變壓法，與普通變阻法者不同，其特點雖電池電壓漸次降落，可不致影響電表的精確度。Ｒ７爲五萬歐姆的變位器Ｒotentiometer電池可以四筒小圓乾電串聯，爲六弗打，Ｒ８須絕對準確的標準電阻五千歐姆，ＳＷ４爲掀紐開關Ｒush　Button　Switch測量的方法，如電阻在０－２０。歐姆範圍内者·可接在ＣＬ兩接頭上，如在２００－５Ｍ　歐姆内者，應接在ＣＨ間，開上ＳＷ１掀住ＳＷ４旋轉Ｒ７使電表指針的偏倚·適達頂點ＬＭＡ處，然後放開ＳＷ４便可自電表上讀出電阻的數値。</p>
<h3>二只優良的濾波器</h3>
<p>— Ｄ.</p>
<p>英文中Ｗave　Trap和Filter二字，在我國都譯作濾波器，其實這二字的意義並不相同，Ｗave　Ｔrap是用於天綫的濾波器，Ｆilter是用於電源的濾波器，下面介紹的就是一只ＷaveＴrap和一只Ｆiter</p>
<p>如圖一，是用一只變量容電和一只變動波長器（Ｖariometer）所組用的濾波器，當閘刀向左擲的時候，電容器行綫若綫圈順連，可以使无綫的效能增加；假圈有干擾的時候，將閘刀向右擲，那麽電容器和綫圈並連，就成一只良好的濾波器了。</p>
<p>圖二是一只Ｆilter，綫圈用十八號雙秒包綫繞在二时直徑的筒上，共繞二百圈，照圖裝上，可以使電源上的雜音不再傳到你的收音機裏來（注意電容器須耐高壓）</p>
<h3>單管雙效收音機的介紹</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>近來，新式複用眞空管，在業餘界裏，頗形風行，良以其效力的驚人，與乎使用的經濟，實在是前此未有的。此種眞空管的發明，正滿足了一一般業餘研究者的奢望：實踐了無數無綫電迷的夢想；不可不謂無綫電進步過程中的一大奇蹟。複用眞空管的種類繁多，本刋曾有過不少介紹，似已無庸再述，這裏，我來介紹一只５３號複用管製成的收音機綫路，以供讀者採納。</p>
<p>這機是以５３號兩用三極管製成的，此種眞空管，類似１０，不過因爲適用於交流電源，所以較１９多、一陰極、牠的絲極電壓地２·５Ｖ，電流是２Ａ，僅比２７眞空管多·２５Ａ，而功能却勝過２７兩倍有强；管的内部，包含兩個放大率較高的三極管，用作Ｂ類擴大時，功效特著；在這機内，我是利用作一級檢波，及一級低放的：因爲放大率頗高，故音量的洪大，較之普通兩管機，猶過之；收本埠放揚聲器，已不成問題，且决不會輕如蚊呌的。</p>
<p>綫路很平凡，是業餘界盡人皆知的再生式；控制再生力者，爲一○——二五○○○歐姆的電阻器，故再方異常穩定。低週率變壓器比率不宜過高，用３：１者最適宜。ＲＦＣ普通適合長波用者，均可。此外接綫等均無特殊。電源之高壓輸出，需有１８０Ｖ，抵壓２·５Ｖ，整流管用７１已可，綫圈曁其他另件容量列表如下；—</p>
<p>綫圈——一寸半徑膠管Ｌ２０圈Ｌ１７５圈Ｌ３０圈繞於一寸徑膠管上均用２８號綫</p>
<p>Ｃ——·○○○五ＭＦＤ變量電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ１——·○○○二五ＭＦＤ固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ２——·五ＭＦＤ固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ３——·○○六ＭＦＤ固定電容器</p>

<h3>無綫電廣播事業在日本（續）</h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>廣播電台</p>
<p>日本在地理上，可以被放送恊會分做七區，每區中設有一個十基羅瓦特的大電台和幾個小電力的電台，一共爲二十五個，這許多電台都負着中繼（Ｒelaying）消息和交換節目的職務，所以它們是很有聯絡精神的訓練的，七個大電台的呼號電力等見右表：</p>
<p>台名　呼號　電力　週率　波長</p>
<p>（一）東京中央放送局　ＪＯＡＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·第一—八七○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三四五　第二—五九○Ｋ·Ｃ·　五○八</p>
<p>（二）大阪中央放送局　ＪＯＢＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·第一—七五○Ｋ·Ｃ·　四○○　第二—一○八五Ｋ·Ｃ·　二七六</p>
<p>（三）名古屋中央放送局　ＪＯＣＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·第一—八一○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三七○　第二—一一七五Ｋ·Ｃ·　二五五</p>
<p>（四）廣島中央放送局　ＪＯＦＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·　八五○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三五三</p>
<p>（五）態本中央放送局　ＪＯＧＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·　七九○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三八○</p>
<p>（六）仙臺中央放送局　ＪＯＨＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·　七七○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三九○</p>
<p>（七）札幌中央放送局　ＪＯＩＫ　１０Ｋ·Ｗ·　八三○Ｋ·Ｃ·　三六○</p>
<p>二十五個電台中，東京，大阪，名古屋三個是廣播界的老前輩，機械最新，人才濟濟，並且，他們都用二個不同的波長，同時播送二種不同的節目，其他各電台如ＯＢＧ，ＪＯＤＧ，ＪＯＸＫ等等，也都位處在重要的城市裏，機械方面，除了三位老前輩以外，都是在日本本國製造的，播音台房屋方面，因爲大都均不合近代電台的需要了，所以現在趕工建造或是從事籌劃的，也頗不少，因政治上，地理上，和經濟上的不同，所以朝鮮和臺灣的廣播事業，並不直隸於日本放送恊恊會，朝鮮的廣播電台，是受朝鮮放送恊會管理的，漢城中央放送局ＪＯＤＫ也用二種波長同時播送（三三三公尺和四九二公尺）電力是十基羅瓦特，三三三公尺的用日本語播送，四九二公尺的用朝鮮語播送。</p>
<p>在臺灣，廣播事業是受臺灣放送恊會處理的，台灣現有二個電台，一在台北州（ＪＦＡＫ，四四八公尺十Ｋ·Ｗ·），一在台南市（ＪＦＢＫ，四一七公尺，１０ＫＷ·），朝鮮放送恊會和臺灣放送恊會，都直接受當地總督府的管理和扶助，（待續）</p>
<h3>單管旅行式收音機</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>—收程遙遠隔音清楚—</p>
<p>綫路說明　收音機效率的優良，並不專恃電力的强大，綫路的繁複，雖一小工率的收音機，祗要設計適當，配置合宜，也不難求得良好的成績·所以在我們業餘研究者的心目中，一只小小的一二管機，已很够使人滿足的了，現在作者來介紹的這只旅行式單管機就是合乎我們理想中櫌越的小型收音機的一種，綫路是採用超再生式，收程的遙遠當然是意中事了，不過普通這類收音機之選擇性不十分優越，現在此機的再生圈採用特殊的裝置，當然選擇力的增進是十分可觀的了。</p>
<p>應用另件</p>
<p>此機用件極爲簡單；大部分都是普通單管機中所有者，僅有少數幾件須重新購置。今將各用件之數値，容量及造法詳述於後，以供參考。</p>
<p>（一）Ｃ·調整波長用之變量電容器容量爲０００３５ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>（二）Ｃ１　調節再生力用之變量電容器</p>
<p>容量爲·０００３ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>（三）Ｃ２　栅極電容器容量爲·０００１ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>（四）Ｃ３　傍路電容器容量爲·００４ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>（五）Ｃ４　傍路電容容器量爲·００２ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>（六）ＬＬ１Ｌ２　三四路綫圈製法··可用蛛網版三枚，一繞　十圈作Ｌ，一繞七十圈作Ｌ１，一繞五十圈作Ｌ２，同以二十六號漆包綫繞畢後，架以三四路旋轉</p>
<p>架，以備調節。</p>
<p>（七）Ｌ３Ｌ４　感應綫圈製法；用二十六號漆包，在蛛網板上繞Ｌ３，三十五</p>
<p>圈；於另一蛛網板上用同號綫繞Ｌ４三十五圈，然後架以旋轉架以調節之。</p>
<p>（八）Ｌ５Ｌ６　發振綫圈製法，以三十號漆包在一时徑管上，繞一千二百圈作Ｌ５，不必剪斷，抽一頭卽可，繼繞一千圈作Ｌ６，繞時不必以整齊爲美觀，亂繞之卽得。</p>
<p>（九）Ｒ３ＭＦＧ栅漏</p>
<p>（十）Ｖ１５號直流傍熱式眞空管，此式眞空管問世未久，業餘同志對牠，自多隔膜了今特作介紹於後，以資同好。</p>
<p>１５號眞空管爲最新問世之直流眞空管，其構造與３８·４４等式相似，因爲她不是燈絲直接給熱所以最合旅行機内作檢波工作，不致發生雜郸，其特性如下。</p>
<p>絲壓　二弗打　絲流　○·二二安培</p>
<p>屏壓　一三五弗打　屏流　一·八五千分安培</p>
<p>幛壓　六七·五弗打　栅壓　一·五弗打</p>
<p>（十）（一）Ａ電　二弗打蓄電池</p>
<p>（十）（二）Ｂ電　四十五弗打小型Ｂ電</p>
<p>（十）（三）Ｊ揷口其他聽筒，燈座接綫柱等。</p>
<p>調整手續：此機調節手續，於第一次較騐時頗緊惟至地步手續完畢後，以後則無異於普通再生式一管機，其第一次的調整法如下：先旋動Ｃ至所需波長，再旋動Ｃ１至聲音最響爲度，同時並調節Ｌ·２，及Ｌ３１·４之距　，使聲音清晰，此步手續完畢，卽可，以後卽可使之固立，而僅調節Ｃ１以控制再生。</p>
<p>附識此機收音極爲靈敏，普通可不需天地綫，如Ｌ２接栅極容電器處拖以</p>
<p>二十尺之花綫則成績更佳。</p>

<h3>再論批評</h3>
<p>— 羊棗</p>
<p>中國以前文人玩的一套，是尋章摘句，推字敲辭。此外不是相輕，便是相榜，而所謂批評，可說是没有；有，也是不是相駡，便是相捧的。</p>
<p>可以說得上是批評，大槪是跟着暎夷打開大門，商品一擁而進之後才出現的吧？「飲冰室文集」該算得代表之一。</p>
<p>也許正因爲是跟着那東西同來的緣故，自從有了之後，批評就總帶着些商品氣。駡你的，我的價値增商；捧你的，大家一齊登龍。因爲祗有文人能寫，把戲還是專門。相輕相榜的老脾氣照舊之外，銅臭還加上一點。</p>
<p>安那托·法郎士曾說：「我從没讀過一篇關於我自已的批評，因爲我覺得没有必要」。不去理會任何謾駡，嘲笑，諷刺，或眞正的批評，似乎是已一般地被認爲自重的君子底高尙態度的。法郎士那樣說也自有他的理由，在創作和批評已經普遍地成了商品的時候。</p>
<p>可是也有自命不凡而實際腹内空空的什麽家，一旦被别人戳穿了紙老虎，便立刻怒氣冲天，「圈子」哪，「頭巾氣」哪，「令人齒冷」哪，祗差不駡他的娘，臨了還來一個「老死不相往來」，實行關門經濟，保護土產，抵制外貨。</p>
<p>於是批評家便該「死無葬身之地」了。</p>
<p>其實，雖在這麽個商品世界之中，凡是批評，祗要是公開的，莫不沾上了點氣味，但也有些確不是商品的。確有一種批評，它是在唐吉格德式的想把一切陷人類於不能自拔的陷阱内的成見，習慣，風俗，制度···加以審查，再估價，批判，揚棄，替被陷的指引一條共登彼岸的大路。這種批評之所以能產生，發展，主要地還得先從批評自已起。</p>
<p>而許多人所受不了的恰是這種批評，因爲坐在陷阱裏看不見陷阱，而以爲裏面很舒服。</p>
<p>批評在中國是太少了，尤其是自我批評。</p>
<h3>一部二十五史</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>民國十六年，我在浙江省立圖書館服務；適値王克敏家中的藏書，以逆產充公，全數由省立圖書館保管。館中派人去點書，駐王氏家廟的某師長要留下一部二十四史。單不庵先生讓他於殿本與同文本兩者之間，任意選取一部，他却選了同文本的。我們暗暗發笑，覺得武人畢竟眼光淺陋。後來一轉想，點綴書齋，顯得堂皇富豐，當然同文本不及殿本；就實用講，殿本實在不如同文本，武人也自有他自已的選擇標準。歷年來在史堆裏鑽了一些時，更覺得那位師長的見解不錯，二十四史若不變成案頭的二十四史，除了做裝飾品，别的没有眞實的用處。開明本的二十五史，比百衲本二十四史的影印，更有社會的意義。</p>
<p>就史論史，史料的蒐集，愈豐富愈好；十九世紀，德國史學家所致力的，就是大規模的史料彙編。中國社會史論戰，没有什麽成熟的結論，最大原因選在史料過於缺乏。史學界還有一種幼稚病，好作闊大無邊際的公式史論，而不肯耐性作史料理（編目與索引）工夫；「一部十七史從何說起一，那一句諷刺話，倒變成治史者的遁詞，彷彿一部二十五史，更無從說起，因陋就簡一點，也不碍事的。以現代治史方法的進步，索引編目都有極簡便的方法，駕馭一部二十五史，本非難事。假使有這樣一個小團體，依照前人編理經策通篡的前例，將二十五史，正續資治通鑑，九通，等史籍完全打散，重新改編，中國史學必可别開一新天地。改編的設計，我曾經擬議過一回。定名爲中國文化通鑑長編，項目如左：</p>
<p>隨着這部長編，可以附帶編成三部大辭典，Ａ中國文化大辭典，Ｂ中國學術大辭典，Ｃ中國文學大辭典。順理成章，可以產生幾種新史··Ａ中國通史Ｂ中國文化史，Ｃ中國學術思想史，Ｄ中國文學史，Ｅ中國社會史，這些從直接材料整理出的新史，或者可免去嚮壁虚構的老毛病。再擴展開去，當然有幾十種小史可以逐漸編成。</p>
<p>以司馬光編理資治通鑑的前例來看，（自宋英宗治平二年至宋神宗元豐七年，先後共經十九年；溫公自已綜其大成，前後漢由劉貢文主編，從三國到隋，由劉道原主編，從唐到五代，由范純甫主編，其他還粗許多帮忙的官屬。）這部中國文化通鑑長編的編成，至少要有三五十人從事工夫，至少要經過三十年至五十年的長期，在一些急性或苟安的人看來，或者以爲愚不可及。但我們不希望中國史學有成就則已，否則一部二十五史，首先要使他有頭有緒地來說起。</p>
<p>公曆　年代　甲子　天文　地理　學術思想史料　學術思想家　學術名著　政治史料</p>
<p>政治大事件　政治人物　社會史料　社會大事件　社會人物　國外大事記　瑣記</p>
<h3>兒子的誕生</h3>
<p>— 暉嬴</p>
<p>踏進醫院的大門，内心裏反上一陣激烈的跳動，原因很簡單，只是爲着那一件事情··</p>
<p>「不知道她可怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>走到電梯門口，急急按了一下電鈴，我是急於要上樓看個究竟的。</p>
<p>門開了，白衣待者望着這我邊幅不修的來客，挺直着胸脯問··</p>
<p>「幾層樓？」</p>
<p>「三層。」</p>
<p>「三層不能乘。」</p>
<p>没有問他理由，也没有和他爭執，因爲這只有躭誤時間，横豎這不是醫院訂好的規章，就是因的我的衣帽不能壓人。</p>
<p>用自已患難相共，時刻不離的兩腿，上了三層樓。</p>
<p>心更跳得厲害了。</p>
<p>照着昨天女看護告訴的號頭，找着房間。</p>
<p>忽然掀起一陣嬰兒啼哭聲，忽然又止息了。從身旁敞開的門，看到屋中安置有七八座小巧精緻的小床，哭聲就是從這間屋中飄散出來的。</p>
<p>「自已的孩子也在這間屋裏麽？」</p>
<p>想着，脚步步近了要找的房間，恰好昨天見過的女看護，從屋裏走出來，看見我，向我笑着。</p>
<p>我猜到她告訴我的消息，將是平安的而不是不幸的，跳動的心房立卽靜止住了。</p>
<p>「Ｘ先生，恭喜你生了一個弟弟。</p>
<p>孩子是生下了，但是孩子的媽媽可怎麽樣呢？她爲什麽不先說到當媽的身上？急人等不得了，就問她說··</p>
<p>「大人可好麽？」</p>
<p>「大人也好。孩子才少有呢，足足有九磅重，頭才大呢。」</p>
<p>她說得歡天喜地的，好像這孩子就是她自已生下來的。至於我這作父親的倒没有她那種高興，可是我的脚步，不知不覺跟她走進孩子停身的屋子裏。</p>
<p>由她的指示，我看到門旁第二個小床上的孩子，孩子的右手上，繫着一個圓紙片，上面寫着精巧的鋼筆字··</p>
<p>「Ｂed　6X弟弟。」</p>
<p>這就是我的兒子了。兒子————誕生了。</p>
<p>在同一時間内，勾起我的往事，要我在孩子面前默默告訴他··</p>
<p>「孩子，你可知道你的出生是何等不易麽，你的爸爸和媽，就爲的無力養育你，曾經要打掉你的，感謝那醫生索價太貴，留得了你的一條生命，你能在人世上佔有一條生命，實是不容易啊。」</p>
<p>兒子生下來了，作了爸爸了，生活的負擔加重了，責任——也多起來了。在以發揚大日爾曼民族精神自任的希特勒領導下德國國民中，生下一個孩子，原是可以自豪的，歡喜的，然而我這個作父親的，却認爲，生了一個孩子，就是多了一層牽累。</p>
<p>跟女看護走進孩子媽媽停留的屋子，看見這位新的母親帶出來古舊的疲乏情狀。她笑了，彷彿心有所慰似的說··</p>
<p>「還好，總算度過了死門關。」</p>
<p>我向她點着頭，握起她的手。作了媽媽，她當眞關心起自已的孩子了，他</p>
<p>問我··</p>
<p>「你看見孩子没有？可好麽？」</p>
<p>鬆開手，我低聲說··</p>
<p>「看見了，孩子很好，在睡覺呢，只是我們都不再是孩子了。」</p>
<h3>攝影</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>斗方（三）</h3>
<p>— 何為</p>
<p>「這聯寫得好，簡直像扁額上的金字一樣，要這樣才使我高興！」</p>
<p>於是嘻嘻哈哈的一路笑出去了，滿面紅光，彷彿我寫得比較好一點的幾個字，已經保證了我的富貴喧嚇的前途。</p>
<p>他跟這個說，跟那個說，不論看到什麽人他就誇口。說什麽我的前途眞是非凡，將來一定撈得到一官半職。他說在前清，字寫得好的人一定中狀元，起碼點翰林，現在大約也還是差不多情形。别提成人，就是碰到小孩子，在他高興的時候，父親也會尖着喉說大話··</p>
<p>「···嚇，他年紀比你還輕，本領却高你幾倍，你眞是是給他遞遞筆墨，倒尿壺還不够資格···哈······」</p>
<p>聽到這些話，不知怎麽的，我不但不感歡喜，却反而皮膚起栗，全身都不舒服，彷彿吃了不很靈騐的麻藥。這並不是害臊，怕什麽人譏笑我，實在只是對於父親的一種反感，一種幾乎近於鄙夷和憎惡交錯的情緒。</p>
<p>像古董商人跑古董店似的，父親在過年以前，也忙忙碌地出入豪紳之門。因爲窮人自然會把斗方恭恭敬敬的送上門來，豪紳們却是坐在那裏等你的。</p>
<p>差不多所有豪紳家里的斗方，父親都拉到了，除開張老爺家里的——這自然是父親的一件憾事。他是我們村里唯一的大户，田有幾千畝，屋有幾十椽，妻妾子孫是滿屋擠的。附近一帶的貧民，没有一個不是他的佃農，人數多到在送租的時候可以編成幾個隊伍。他自已是舉人，幾個兒子全是大學生，連孫子也在中學小學裏念書了，威風眞是嚇人的。每任知事一上任，就得下鄉拜會他，這更使他增高了聲價。</p>
<p>他不送斗方給我寫，並不是他自已家里念書人多，用不到托人。那些大爺小爺們，雖則念了書，却全是安樂慣的，誰也不願在冷天震抖抖的寫字。</p>
<p>原因倒是在他家里的斗方，全是早已油漆好了的，紅底金字，非常耀目，不是經過多少年的風風雨雨，也不會剥落。從很看去，就能看到那座黑漆台門上面的長年對，在發着亮光。氣魄奪人。那些對聯上的字，全出自名手，因此更覺可貴了。</p>
<p>「嚇，要是張大爺家裏的斗方能够給你寫，小如！······」</p>
<p>父親時常屈屈手指，挖挖鼻孔，不勝感慨惋惜似的說。</p>
<p>「眞是了不起，如果那樣的大户人家···聽說有個書法大家送對子給張大爺，想打點秋風，他連理也不理會···小如用功呵···再練十年字看看······」</p>
<p>爲了這件事，父親也時常跟母親說，同她誇耀張老爺的威望，說我只要够了給他寫斗方的資格，以後就不愁没有出頭的一天了。</p>
<p>這是父親大的幻想，他的心裏牽牽掛掛的記着張老爺，張老爺家裏的斗方，就連做夢也是念念不忘的。</p>
<p>機會終於到來了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>婦女强奸男子</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>前日立法院開會，審議妨害風化罪章，各委爭辯之烈，爲前所未有，確眞，妨害風化一事，非但討論很有趣味，卽社會發生這種事情，也比較其他案件爲多。</p>
<p>各委發表的意見，共分四點··（一）强奸對像應否將婦女改爲男女，（二）强奸刑度應否加重，（三）奸淫幼女年齡，應否將十四歲改爲十六歲，（四）輪奸犯應否照現行法恢復，其（二）（三）（四）條，除第三條旣可便宜幾輩色情狂的男子，更可省却許多</p>
<p>强奸案件麻煩外，並無其他意見，惟對於應改爲男女二字，或異性二字，我到十分贊同，何以結果竟遭否决。</p>
<p>某委謂，男子非法奸淫婦女爲强奸，婦女非法奸淫男子亦爲强奸，應將第一項之對於「婦女」，應改爲對於「男女」，以示平等，若驟聞此語，豈不是一件大大的笑話，只有鏡花緣中的女人國有此怪現象，從來只有男子强奸女子，而未聞女子去强奸男子，此事非特從來所無，亦爲事實所不可能，其實這種見解，已成過去，並未深察近日社會情形者。</p>
<p>天下事往往有出於理所必無。而爲情所或有者，并且性慾的要求，原無分於男女，世界上只有色情狂的男子追求女子，而没有色情狂的女子追求男子，這原是一偏的見解，從前因爲舊禮敎所束縛，只該男子放肆，而不准女子放肆，所以「窈窕淑女」，只有「君子好求」。試問現在的世界，是否象從前一樣，未來的世界，是否象現在一樣。</p>
<p>就拿事實來講，滬上曾發生過謝姓女子，强奸一未成年的意國少年。梅蘭芳在靑年時，在北平演劇，下塲出門，曾被一閨秀前去强行接吻，此事强奸罪雖未成立，而意圖强奸罪，却已成立，其時舊禮敎雖已打破，而未盡打破，已發生此種現象，現在色情狂的婦女，赤裸裸表演出來的，其事例正多，孰謂只有男子可以强奸女子，而没有婦女强奸男子。若照現在情形來看，恐已不能作爲定論吧？</p>
<p>王道不外人情，立法尤重事實。如不將婦女二字改爲男女，或異性二字，萬一再發生以上同樣事情，說牠不爲罪吧？在法律上失平等原則，說牠爲罪吧？在法律上又無根據，使法官如何處理呢？并且法律的效力，本來是不溯旣往，而是遏制將來，則在刑法上應有此條，於情理上實無可缺。</p>
<h3>書齋偶語</h3>
<p>— 哲人</p>
<p>（二）黑人歌者</p>
<p>對於爵士樂，我是向來抱着輕視的態度的··無論牠有着怎樣輕快的旋律，㶷爛的外形，總覺得缺少一些藝術的本質的東西，初期的爵士還有一些明朗的意味，適合都市主義的精神，有時還能傳送一些談談的哀愁，一些戀歌的低徊情緒，可是演變到現在，這流行一時的音樂却變成一點内容也没有，只剩了些混亂的節拍的一團騒音了，那樣原始的</p>

<p>黑人音樂居然風靡了新興垢亞美利加民族，而且被文化之邦的西歐各國所歡迎着，不是很費解的事麽？這疑念一直滯留在胸中，到去年冬天一個雨雪霏霏的晚上，因偶然的高興，在俱樂部裏坐了五小時，看了一個黑人歌者的表演，才找到了解釋。</p>
<p>那個黑人歌者和所有的黑人一樣生着一副呆鈍而没有表情的臉，愚魯的嘴唇，和遲緩，没爲光彩而蠢拙的眼。他站在那裏，低下了頭，低下了眼皮，在地板上緩緩地移動着，跟着那活潑而刺激的色士風，一個低沉的聲音從他嘴唇裏邊悉悉地漏了出來。唱着的時候，他没有搖動他的手臂，没有搖動他的身子，像白人的爵士歌者一樣，他只是低着頭，看着地板，像在沉思着什麽似地，吐出了一個蘊蓄着沉重的疲倦和悲哀的調子。我聽見一個黑色的靈魂在那裏向上帝祈禱，這不是明快的爵士，在熱閙的形式裏邊包含着的是絕望的，快要消滅了的尼格羅民族的呼聲，一個高度的，定命的，民族的悲哀。這位黑人歌者用遲緩的動作，低沉的音調來配合了明朗的旋律，深深地感動了聽衆。於是我才恍然於黑人音樂的眞面目。那樣直接而迅速的感動力！</p>
<p>就是爲了這直接而迅速的感動力吧，亞美利加民族把黑人音樂的形式從沉痛的民族悲哀隔離了出來、便成了流行的爵士音樂，然而爵士音樂是怎樣廉價的商品呵。</p>
<p>在這裏，我得到了一些小小的感想，藝術的内容和形式是一個不可分離的，有機的綜合。懷着那樣的槪念，再看看一最近文壇上一批志在登龍者所提出的文學遺產這口號，和他們的看法，將以怎樣滑稽的恣態出現在眼前呢！用他們的方法來接受了遺產之後，文學作品也會和目下的小品文，或者說是雜品一樣，成爲白人的爵士音樂那樣的東西吧。</p>
<h3>老通寳和他的孫子</h3>
<h3>調查户口</h3>
<p>— 若木</p>
<p>韓江的奔流老是澎湃地湍逝着。濃絲的枝頭，轟着陣陣的雀噪。這時雄踞韓江下流的Ｋ鎭，突然地發出了一陣叭喇的嗚咽之聲，那是召集調查户口的準備的號令了。Ｋ鎭在過去幾年間，可說是一個世外桃源的仙境。然而現在已大不如前了。因受了世界恐慌的波動，這里的居民，在今年開頭的時候，也閙過了一次通匪的嫌疑，而受了當局的注意了。於是Ｋ鎭便也和其他的村鎭一樣，要受嚴格的户口的檢查了。——軍事的户口檢查了。</p>
<p>今天是Ｋ鎭調查户口的第一天，全鎭的居民隨着各人的呼呌聲齊集在廣塲上了。調查户口專委的Ｘ營長，也迀徐地跟着叭喇聲底停止而出現了。他有着滿身漂亮的軍服，腰裏掛着兩把勃郎林面孔是滿裝着一臉的威嚴，形成了一個四方八穩的多廓。特别的是他有着一雙稜角的眼，當它剽掠過每一個人的臉上的時候，像有着電流般的力量一樣，會使每個人的臉色爲之慘白。</p>
<p>鄕長某先生顫巍巍捧着一册薄薄的户籍簿，向着Ｘ營長走來，當然這在Ｘ營長是負有上峯的使命來的，他對於鄕長的某先生是不用講客套，—而且也無須講客套的。所以他便不客氣地默然地從某先生的手中拿過户籍簿，而開始其調查的工作了。</p>
<p>人的名字一個個隨着時間底急逝而從Ｘ營長的口中唱過了。這約莫是最後的吧。當李大頭公孫緊跟着Ｘ營長最後唱着的一人，走過Ｘ營長的面前的時候，Ｘ營長的稜角的眼睛，挺得寛寛地注意着他，「嫌疑犯，名册上没有他底名字！捉住，應立卽槍决！」</p>
<p>全塲的人們已是給Ｘ營長的喊聲嚇住了。某先生的臉色慘白了。被捉住的嫌疑犯李大頭公孫，却像木偶般站住着，舉着兩雙飽含着眼涙的眼睛，向鄕長某先生哀求着。</p>
<p>這時正是李大頭生死關頭的危險塲面鄕長某先生雖然嚇得手足無措，然而他不能不仗義地來爲李大頭公孫洗刷不白之寃。所以某先生緊抓住自已的頭皮，向Ｘ營長懇求，他說··李大頭公孫是在這里做小生意的，他們是客籍，不能塡進本鄕的户籍册内。他可以担保他，担保他不是匪類。然而Ｘ營長因爲陳先生太爲李大頭公孫盡力了的緣故，對某先生也起了櫰疑的念頭。以爲某先生也是一位包庇匪類的嫌疑犯，應加以捕捉，於是某先生現在也成爲一位嫌疑的犧牲者，而被關進拘留所了。</p>
<h3>冬底啓示</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>秋，深了，深了，輕悄地，輕悄地，又將離開這人園隱去了。</p>
<p>風，颼颼地吹，颼颼地吹，向着這大地上的人間，向着這濃叢的樹木，向着這清澈的溪流，向着這連亘的山岳，衰老，乾枯的葉子在脫落，飛飄，清澈的溪流呢？那水面的漣漪呵，是在不住的奔逐，消逝呵！</p>
<p>路面上，也似乎有了點顯著的差異，牠，不再像夏日般的流着汗油，也不再像初秋似的有着一層鬰秀叢濃的活氣，到現在，只是很恬靜的，肅穆的在噙着滿腔的憂怨呵！</p>
<p>店舖裏，總是佔「時」之「先聲」的，那先前的市招，變換了，是灰鼠，狐腿，人參，燕窩，已成了當令的前鋒，···　這一切，都在轉換着，不，也有不　換的，那是街頭人羣的奔流呵！</p>

<p>紅紅地唇，高高地鼻子，靈活的一雙眼睛，在微笑的時分，從那弧形綫的口唇裏所露出來的又潔白又齊楚的牙齒，那該是多麽逗人的風度喲！</p>

<p>然而，僻靜的路隅裏，正有着那哀慘的呌號。擠了進去，地上寫得是那麽一片白——</p>
<p>······家鄕延吉，不堪匪禍，相率逃亡，沿途求乞，始抵海上，復以投親不遇，落難他鄕，地疏人生，呼籲無從，束腹忍飢，瞬經二日，惟望各界仁人君子······</p>
<p>許多的人圍着，銅板散亂的扔在地上，有幾個人在嘆息，有幾個人在含着神秘的微笑，也有幾個人在釘視着那了垂頭的少婦，哼，瞧吧，這就是大都會裏人情的一面縮寫呵！</p>
<p>鵝黃的窗帘低垂着，那燈光從綿紗的燈罩裏放出了嬌艷的光彩，無綫電在清脆的報告——</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Protest Against Japan</h3>
<p>Accusations of Violating the Open Door Policy</p>
<p>The Netherlands Also Takes Similar Action</p>
<p>Japan Aims to Seize Control, Seeking Fuel Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>(London) Following the announcement of the "Manchukuo" plan to implement a petroleum monopoly, the British and American governments immediately lodged protests. The U.S. government stated that the monopoly would harm the interests of American companies like Standard Oil, and violate the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty. Today, the British government lodged protests through the British Consul in Changchun and the British Ambassador to Tokyo, stating that the monopoly violates the spirit and letter of Article Three of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is reported that the Dutch government will also lodge a protest within days. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Reuters has learned that the British government is in constant contact with the Japanese government regarding the "Manchukuo" oil industry issue, but has yet to receive a satisfactory response. When the plan for the "Manchukuo" Petroleum Company to enjoy a monopoly was announced, the British government immediately questioned the Japanese government. In August, the British government again cited various Open Door declarations to warn the Japanese government, hoping to express how seriously the British government would view the implementation of such a plan. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today from authorities that the State Department has formally protested to Japan regarding its attempt to exclude foreign petroleum companies from Japan and "Manchukuo." It is also reported that Britain and the Netherlands have also lodged similar protests. It is understood that all three countries have notified the Tokyo authorities that Japan's plan to establish a petroleum monopoly in Manchuria violates the Open Door Policy in China. The notes from the three countries also urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the repeated violations of treaties signed between Japan and other countries. The submission of this protest at this time is of particular significance, as naval talks are underway in London, and the ultimate aim of Japan's attempt to seize the petroleum monopoly is none other than to ensure its fleet's self-sufficiency in petroleum. Petroleum companies in Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have repeatedly complained about unfair treatment in Japan and Manchuria. Regarding Manchuria, the complaint is that the Japanese intend to obtain a controlling patent to sell all petroleum products in Manchuria. As for Japan, the complaint is that Japan requires foreign petroleum companies to maintain a reserve of oil at their depots at all times, equal to the amount sold in the past six months. Oil companies say that after this regulation is implemented, companies will have to build more oil tanks and expand their capital, making it impossible to continue operating in Japan. Authorities here told the Associated Press that there is no treaty relationship involved with Japan, but regarding Manchuria, observers believe that this protest can be seen as the three governments still regarding "Manchukuo" as Chinese territory, and therefore still bound by the principle of the Open Door Policy. As for Japan's demand that companies store oil in Japan, some experts here believe that in the event of war, the Japanese fleet would have sufficient fuel. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Sophistry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry, in order to clarify the truth regarding the protests from Britain, the United States, and other countries concerning the control of Manchurian oil, issued a statement in the form of an official talk on the evening of the 26th, as follows:</p>
<p>Protests have been lodged with the Japanese government by Britain, the United States, and other countries regarding the petroleum control plan in "Manchukuo." This information is the latest news transmitted by news telegrams from Britain, the United States, and other countries. The truth is as follows:</p>
<p>On July 2nd, the British Embassy and on July 7th, the American Embassy submitted informal memoranda regarding the establishment of the Manchurian Petroleum Company and the implementation plans of the "Manchukuo" authorities for the petroleum monopoly, etc. In order to ascertain whether the information obtained by the two ambassadors was accurate, and regarding the views of the embassy on this matter, the Foreign Ministry gave the following replies separately on August 3rd:</p>
<p>(1) The "Manchukuo government's" policy regarding the establishment of the Manchurian Petroleum Company and the petroleum plan itself of the "Manchukuo" authorities is not known to the Japanese government. Therefore, the Japanese government is in a position where it is inconvenient to make any explanations on this matter. However, for reference, the Japanese government records the latest information obtained, and the general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>"Manchukuo" has established the Manchurian Petroleum Company, a "Manchukuo" legal entity, based on the special regulations promulgated on February 21st of this year. The regulations do not confer any exclusive rights to the company, and there are no nationality restrictions on the holders of the company's shares. Currently, the "Manchukuo" government, in view of the precedents of European countries, is formulating laws regarding the control of the petroleum industry, an important industry, but it seems that it is still under consideration. According to information, the main aim of the bill is that the government monopolizes petroleum sales in order to achieve control, and it is not that the government monopolizes the manufacture, import, and export of petroleum. Furthermore, the bill does not contain any provisions granting the above-mentioned petroleum company any exclusive rights regarding the manufacture and import/export, etc. of petroleum. According to information, the "Manchukuo" side's plan, which is to make the Manchurian Petroleum Company's products monopolize all petroleum sales, does not seem to have been considered.</p>
<p>(2) It is true that the South Manchuria Railway Company will invest in the Manchurian Petroleum Company and that the petroleum company will build a factory in the Kwantung Leased Territory. However, on this point, the Japanese side</p>
<p>does not consider that a problem arises that conflicts with any existing treaties.</p>
<p>(3) In view of the above circumstances, the Japanese government cannot stop Japanese capitalists from investing in the "Manchukuo" legal entity petroleum company, or stop the "Manchukuo" authorities from implementing some form of control over petroleum. On the other hand, the "Manchukuo" government, regarding the purchase and sale of petroleum, intends to give as much consideration as possible to the interests of foreign merchants currently residing in the country. The intention is very clear. Therefore, it is hoped that parties with vested interests will negotiate directly with the "Manchukuo" side.</p>
<p>The above is the gist of the Foreign Ministry's response. As for the so-called Open Door Policy in "Manchukuo," if it means that a certain foreign country must not be granted exclusive or exclusionary privileges in commerce, and if the petroleum control system is implemented, if the system does not promote discriminatory treatment based on nationality for Japanese and other foreigners, then it cannot be considered a violation of the so-called Open Door Policy. The view is as such. (Japan United News, 26th)</p>
<h3>South Manchuria Railway Guerrillas Divide and Conquer</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The South Manchuria Railway Volunteers, due to the lack of defensible positions and difficulty in movement, have specially reorganized into scattered groups, forming five-man teams, with one team leader per group, leading four team members, dedicated to patriotic acts of killing the enemy. Whatever they obtain will be supplied to the military. The Japanese garrison along the South Manchuria Railway feels unable to prevent this. The Japanese side has stipulated that from January of next year, all police forces along the railways in the Northeast will be completely reorganized into railway garrison units, staffed by Japanese junior officers, with the same organization as the South Manchuria Railway garrison. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Authorities Investigate Northeast Guerrillas</h3>
<p>(Beijing) Before launching a major autumn suppression campaign against the guerrillas this year, the Japanese puppet forces conducted a precise investigation of the guerrillas in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The results proved that the total number of guerrillas was 100,000, a decrease of about 70,000 compared to last year. The Rehe National Salvation Army still flies the blue-white flag. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) From the 20th of this month, the guerrillas of Su Ziyu's unit in Xinbin and Sangren counties of Liaoning province engaged in an encounter battle with a regiment led by Japanese Captain Yamamura. The result was that 14 Japanese soldiers were killed. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Conduct Street Fighting Drill as Demonstration</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:00 AM today, 80 Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin conducted a street fighting drill in the Japanese Concession. Sandbags were piled up on Miyajima Street, Suma Street, and Matsushima Street. Traffic was temporarily cut off. The drill ended at 1:00 PM. At 9:00 AM, more than 200 Japanese infantry troops in Tianjin also held a demonstration parade. The soldiers were fully armed and marched from the Haiguang Temple barracks along Dajing Road to the main railway station, returning to the barracks via Huangwei Road at 4:00 PM. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This afternoon, Commander Umetsu of the Japanese troops in Tianjin returned to Tianjin from the military inspection in Shanhaiguan. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Responsible for Taking Over the Eastern Tombs</h3>
<p>(Beijing) Yin Rugeng will return to Beijing from Tianjin in a day or two. Yin will still be responsible for the takeover of Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs. The takeover methods have been largely determined. After the withdrawal of the 50-plus Japanese troops stationed there, our security forces will move in. Negotiations are currently underway on how our security forces will move in, and the takeover can be formally carried out in early next month. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Secret Activities of Local Bandits in the Kailuan Mining Area</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A large group of local bandits is entrenched in Zhaogezhuang in Kailuan. The bandits are well-organized and are rumored to be manipulated by someone. Their secret activities have been going on for a long time, and their intelligence is very sensitive. They are planning to loot large sums of money when wages are paid at the mines. The mining police station has already stepped up security. The foremen and miners are planning to raise funds to buy guns and ammunition for self-defense. To avoid the risk of losing wages, the mining bureau plans to postpone the payment of wages this time for two or three days. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than 200 plainclothes troops of Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan have recently infiltrated Baodi County, Hebei Province, and are harassing the villages. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Yutian Has Become a Disaster Area</h3>
<p>(Beijing) After the bandits in Yutian were defeated, the entire county became a disaster area. The authorities have implemented relief measures. The newly appointed Magistrate of Zunhua County, He Xiaoyi, will go to the county in a day or two to take office and oversee matters. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>There Was a Precedent for Postponing the National Congress</h3>
<p>Notification Will Be Issued Within Days</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central authorities' view on the second postponement of the Fifth National Congress is that the general regulations stipulate that the National Congress shall be held every two years, and may be postponed for one year if necessary. The Fourth National Congress was convened in November of the 20th year, which is already three years ago. It seems that there is little basis for postponing it again, but there is a precedent. The Second National Congress was convened in the 15th year, and the Third National Congress was postponed to November of the 18th year, with a distance of nearly four years in between. At that time, it was due to the Northern Expedition military and internal party disputes that it had to be extended. Now, according to the telegrams from the anti-bandit generals among the central committee members and the party departments of various provinces and cities, the postponement is based on the opinions of the majority of comrades. Moreover, suppressing bandits is a major national plan, no less important than the situation in the 17th year. After the postponement, regarding the qualification of representatives elected by the provinces and cities, the Central Committee originally planned to convene a national temporary representative conference in July of last year, which was later extended to November of last year to hold a formal representative conference. At that time, the Central Executive Committee had a resolution that all representatives elected to the temporary conference could attend the formal conference. After another postponement of one year, the qualifications of the representatives will still be handled in accordance with the previous resolution. Although there is another postponement, since the Central Committee has no resolution to overturn the qualifications of the representatives, these representatives will always maintain their qualifications to attend no matter when the postponement takes place. Apart from Mongolia, Tibet, and remote areas, there are not many who have not been elected. A total of 32 overseas representatives have arrived in Nanjing one after another. It is really embarrassing to leave them waiting in Nanjing without a definite date for the convening, especially since they have had to travel so far. Fortunately, 15 of the representatives are originally overseas Chinese and are now working in the capital, so there is no problem. The remaining 17 are now living in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. The Central Party Headquarters has assigned staff from the Liaison Department to present the representatives with the situation of the postponement. A certain representative said, "We have come from afar, and the Congress has been postponed, and there is no definite date. If we return overseas, we will have to come again soon." It is heard that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will be convened on December 10th to discuss the date of the Fifth National Congress. Most of the representatives advocate staying in Nanjing for a while to observe the results of the Fifth Plenary Session before deciding what to do. The overseas representatives all live in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, and the accommodation and meals are very good. As for the telegrams to the members of the Central Executive Committee, the party departments of various provinces and cities, and the overseas party departments, reporting that the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will be convened on December 10th, a notification will be issued within days according to the precedent of notifying one month in advance. Standing Committee Member Wang Zhaoming is scheduled to attend the Central Memorial Week next Monday to explain the process of the plenary session's postponement. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Continues to Discuss the Criminal Law</h3>
<p>Enticing Another's Wife Should Be Punished</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a routine meeting on the morning of the 26th. After discussing ordinary routine cases, it continued to discuss Article 235 of the draft amendment to the Criminal Law: (1) "Whoever entices a man or woman under the age of 20 to leave their family or other person with supervisory authority shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years." (2) "The same shall apply to whoever entices a married woman to leave her family." (3) "Whoever commits the crime in the preceding paragraph with the intention of making a profit or with the intention of causing the enticed person to engage in indecent acts or adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than six months and not more than five years and may also be subject to a fine of not more than 1,000 yuan." (4) "An attempt to commit the crimes in the preceding three paragraphs shall be punished." Among the committee members, there was intense debate over the age issue of enticing and whether enticing another's wife should also be punished. Lou Tongsun, Liang Hancao, and others said that the age stipulated in the first paragraph of this article is too high because men and women aged 18 or 19 are prone to relationships in open social situations, and young urban women are extremely free. Moreover, enticement is a consensual act by peaceful means, so they advocated changing it to under the age of 18. Liu Kejun, Tao Xuan, Shi Shangkuan, and Chen Changheng said that men and women under the age of 20 have weak knowledge and are minors in civil law. Even if there are things that happen to underage men and women in cities, they are also subject to temporary impulses, so they should be protected by guardians. They advocated maintaining the amendment. After the chairman submitted it to a vote, the majority of the committee members believed that the age in the first paragraph should not be lowered. In addition, regarding the second paragraph, Lou Tongsun, Liang Hancao, Chen Changheng, Yang Gongda, and others advocated that there should be a two-way regulation, and that enticing another's husband should also be a crime, so as not to contradict the principle of equality between men and women. It is inappropriate to only stipulate that enticing another's wife is a crime, because it is inappropriate to knowingly snatch another's husband from another's husband. Liu Kejun, Shi Shangkuan, and others said that enticing another's wife destroys the family organization. There is no explicit provision in the current criminal law to punish this, and most legal circles advocate that it should be punished, so this item has been added. Yao Chuanfa advocated that enticing another's husband should be punished. The relationship is still small when a wife is enticed in the countryside, and the most important relationship is with outstanding members. Excellent members come from excellent families, so they must be protected. Modern women have extremely high vanity. The school queen actually entices the husband of a wealthy family, but she is unwilling to be someone's concubine and tries her best to destroy other people's families, intending to form a new family. All of these things prove that enticing another's husband should be punished. Then, the chairman submitted it to a vote. The majority of the attending committee members agreed to amend the second paragraph to "Whoever entices another's wife or husband to leave their family shall also be the same." There was no objection to the third and fourth items, so the second reading was amended and passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM and continued in the afternoon. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to discuss Articles 236 to 239 of Chapter 17 of the draft amendment to the Criminal Law at 3:00 PM on the 26th, all of which were passed in the second reading according to the draft amendment. Article 240 was amended due to the deletion of Article 234, "The crime in Article 233 and the crime in Article 235, paragraph 2, shall be prosecuted only upon complaint." Chapters 18 and 19 were all passed in the second reading according to the draft amendment. In Chapter 20, except that Article 255 was amended according to the chairman's proposal. Because high-root (kudzu) is a product of South America and the Chinese geology is not suitable for planting, the "or high-root" and "or high-root seeds" in the first item and the two "or high-root" in the second item were deleted in order to make the provisions consistent with the actual situation. All other articles were passed in the second reading according to the draft amendment. In Chapter 21, except for Article 261, paragraph 1, which was amended according to the proposal of Chuan Bingchang and Di Ying to add the words "in public places or places accessible to the public" above "gambling property," all other articles were also passed in the second reading according to the draft amendment. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled to continue the discussion on the morning of the 27th. In addition, because Article 234 was deleted, the order of the articles has changed. The chairman announced that the order will be retained for sorting out in the third reading meeting.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Transformation of Roosevelt's Economic Policy</h3>
<p>A Plain Account</p>
<p>The United States has been under the rule of the Roosevelt administration for twenty months. During this period, to what extent he has exerted his efforts for the giants of Wall Street is a question. In this time of global depression, Roosevelt not only did not possess the miraculous skill to revive the dying, but his "medical skill" was also not much more brilliant than that of his political opponent Hoover.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a drastic change in Mr. Roosevelt's policies, he must at least deliver a lengthy speech to explain or defend the position he has adopted. For example, in his speech to the American Bankers Association, he revealed the new direction of his economic policy.</p>
<p>In this speech, Mr. Roosevelt explicitly stated that the world's criticism of his "New Deal" as socialist is actually a misunderstanding. However, we still remember that about a year ago, his main slogans were to shorten working hours and increase wages. He also revised many industry regulations according to these slogans and established the National Recovery Administration, hoping to increase people's purchasing power and take it as the harbinger of industrial and commercial prosperity. At that time, from his own point of view (even from the point of view of ordinary Americans), the use of these very resounding slogans was enough to arouse the optimism of the general public, thinking that his economic policy did have a socialist tendency. Who knew that what he actually did was rich in right-wing implications. This time, at the Bankers Association, he openly praised "the pursuit of profit by all industries," which further showed his right-wing color. It is indeed wrong to say that his "New Deal" is socialist.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt indicated in his speech that only when the US government and banks take completely consistent steps can the "traditional policy" of the United States be maintained. Originally, in the past twenty months, Mr. Roosevelt has not only gradually become a good friend of monopoly capital, but also used the power of national finance to save many trust bankruptcies. As for the policy he is now re-establishing, it is even a step further. He tacitly approves that those banks that hold power can, with the assistance of the government, move towards a higher degree of trustification. The government can also seek a way out of the global economic panic with the help of bankers. Furthermore, the world arms race can both promote the expansion of the military industry market and stimulate the development of the war crisis. In recent months, disputes in Europe have emerged one after another. These disputes are all concrete, indicating the maturity of the crisis. The recent incident in Marseille and the stalemate in the preliminary naval disarmament talks between Britain, the the United States, and Japan all have a particularly significant impact. Although Roosevelt also advocates peace, his peace is armed peace. In today's increasingly serious international situation, he cannot but feel the need to revise his economic policy in order to win the favor of the giants of Wall Street. No wonder everyone is now saying that Roosevelt has turned to the right.</p>

The opening exchange rate between British and American was 4 yuan and 9 corners and 7 points, which was half a point lower than the closing rate of American and British exchange yesterday. After the previous exchange rate rose from 4 yuan and 4 corners and 7 and a half points to 4 yuan and 4 corners and 7 and a half points, it turned to fall.

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>American Cotton The New York cotton market is currently in a stalemate. The opening price fell because there are reports that the climate is good in cotton belt areas. Speculators are slightly disappointed that President Roosevelt's speech did not mention future monetary policy. At the same time, there is also talk of a brewing labor strike in the textile industry. However, Texas reports that transactions with Europe are now showing signs of improvement, and cotton farmers' acceptance of government loans is now gradually making sales scarce. The opening fell by 1 to 3 pounds, but the market price recovered slightly later.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton The Bombay cotton futures market today was particularly sluggish, with no highlights. Trading was quiet. At 5:30 p.m., the price of Bai Luoqu cotton for the April-May period was 208 rupees and 75, a decrease of 1 rupee and 25 compared to yesterday.</p>

<p>New York The New York rubber market opened slightly lower, and then turned stable. The market price recovered slightly.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York The factors favoring market conditions before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange are: (1) a slow and steady improvement in industrial conditions, although some companies still say that autumn business is not prosperous; (2) the third-quarter report of National Steam Plant, with a net profit of $2,514,000, or $1.24 per share, compared to a net profit of $1,478,000 in the same period last year, or $0.73 per share. The unfavorable factors for market conditions are: (1) President Luo's speech, although well-intentioned, had no impact on the securities market, which was disappointing; (2) the securities market is still affected by the negative impact of the report released by United States Steel on Tuesday. When the stock market opened this morning, the market was slightly more active, but yesterday's selling pressure resumed today, with price declines ranging from single digits to two pounds. Due to lack of confidence, even if there is an upward trend, it may not be sustainable. The various market prices of New York securities are listed on the left.</p>

<p>US Fleet Under "Wartime" Regulations</p>
<h3>Passes Through Panama Canal</h3>
<p>Secretly Recalled to the Pacific</p>
<p>Navy Talks Reveal Key Points</p>
<p>Panama The combined US Atlantic and Pacific Fleets passed through the Panama Canal today with exceptional speed. The 88 ships traveled from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean in just 39 hours, a reduction of 7 hours compared to the previous transit of 71 ships from the Pacific to the Caribbean. The aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga moved the slowest through the canal, taking 12 hours because their width was nearly equal to the Gatun locks. As a result, they knocked down some lampposts. The fleet is now sailing to California to continue exercises in the Pacific. During the fleet's passage, 51 merchant ships were temporarily halted. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The entire US fleet completed its passage through the Panama Canal at 4:30 PM today, taking 42 hours. Although this is 5 hours less than the previous 47-hour transit from the Pacific to the Atlantic, the number of ships was also reduced by 20. The news of the US fleet's passage was announced by the Navy Department in Washington. All accompanying journalists were prohibited from sending telegrams under "wartime" regulations. It was generally believed that the fleet was still conducting exercises in the Caribbean Sea and would not return to the Pacific until around November 1st. The news of this has caused great consternation. When announcing the news, Navy Commander Reeves declined to explain why the secrecy was maintained beforehand. Observers believe that there must be a connection between the extensive publicity before the previous passage and the strict secrecy this time. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The London naval talks are only in the opening stages. After yesterday's meeting between British and American representatives, the Japanese representatives met with the British representatives again today, revealing the key points of their proposal. British and Japanese naval experts met this afternoon to discuss technical details. It is reported that the Japanese representatives are now seeking to reduce what they consider naval offensive weapons, in the following order: aircraft carriers, battleships, and 10,000-ton cruisers equipped with 8-inch caliber guns. One of the main obstacles is that Japan considers submarines only defensive weapons, while Britain views them as the most dangerous offensive weapons. The second stage of the discussion will be a collective discussion between the British and American representatives. The British are now informing France and Italy of the progress of the discussions at any time. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Second Anglo-Japanese Meeting</h3>
<p>Exchange of Concrete Matters and Opinions</p>
<p>(London) British and Japanese naval representatives continued their meeting this morning, exchanging opinions on several technical issues in the Japanese proposal. This morning's meeting was chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald, with the Japanese chief representative Yamamoto and the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, attending. After the meeting, British experts, the Director of the American Department of the Foreign Office, Craigie, the Chief of Naval Staff, Liddell, and the main representatives of the Japanese delegation continued the meeting. A communiqué was issued after the meeting, stating, "The Japanese and British representatives met this morning. The Japanese representatives provided a detailed explanation of their government's proposal, and several technical points were clarified. The two sides have now scheduled to continue discussions on Monday." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a report from Ambassador Matsudaira on the progress of the talks between the Japanese representatives and the British and American representatives. The Japanese representatives only discussed the outline of the disarmament plan at the meeting. The British and American representatives were not satisfied and requested the Japanese government to provide a concrete plan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to provide a sincere explanation for this request from the British and American sides, but because it believes that the British and American sides should first propose their own disarmament plan, it intends to ask the British and American sides to pay attention to this point. If understanding is reached, then concrete issues will be discussed. (Rengo, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald invited the American representative Davis to his residence by telephone on the morning of the 25th. Davis immediately went to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street with an attaché, and Foreign Secretary Simon also participated. The meeting lasted about 45 minutes. It was decided that the original Japanese disarmament plan could not be recognized, and the Japanese side was asked to explain concrete matters before a reply could be given. (Rengo, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Observation of the Future of Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>Once and For All or Naval Competition</p>
<p>This Negotiation is a Crucial Key</p>
<p>(Washington) Naval observers stated today that the current London talks have a good chance of becoming a full-fledged conference. If this conference becomes a reality, then naval issues for the next 60 years can be resolved once and for all, and next year's naval conference may not need to be held. This opinion is based on reports from the Navy Department and the State Department on the London talks. It is said that the representatives of the participating countries agree to immediately resolve naval issues and do not want to delay even for a year. If these talks reach a deadlock, or next year's conference fails, then the naval community intends to proceed with its largest naval expansion plan. If Japan actually implements the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, then naval competition is inevitable. Japan intends to demand the abolition of the 5:5:3 naval ratio and raise its naval status. Naval Chief of Staff Swanson has repeatedly declared this. If Japan increases its naval ratio, then the United States will establish naval bases in its Pacific islands. This means that the United States will open fleet bases in the Aleutian Islands, which extend 1,100 miles into the Pacific Ocean, and on Guam and Samoa in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, or even expand the military ports of Hawaii and the Philippines. The United States has already built and will build a total of 68 warships in one month, which is the largest number of ships built since the Washington Conference. If all 68 ships are completed, then it will still be 78 ships less than the limit allowed by the treaty. The Chinese Congress passed a bill in June to build these 78 ships, and it is expected that 20 or 25 ships will be built each year in the future. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Industrial Group Leaves Japan</h3>

<h3>Lloyd George's New Book on the European War Published</h3>
<p>Blames General Haig for the Battle of Flanders</p>
<p>(London) Lloyd George's fourth volume of memoirs of the European War was published today. In the book, he vehemently criticizes General Haig, the British Commander-in-Chief during the European War, and Sir Robertson, the British Army Chief of Staff from 1915 to 1918, for their miscalculations in the Battle of Flanders in Belgium in 1917. George vividly describes the battle as one of the most tragic and costly of the European War, saying that Haig wasted the lives of 400,000 British soldiers to satisfy his vanity, using his cunning to conceal the facts and deceive the cabinet. Haig initially said that the battle would not result in major losses, and then recklessly tried to break through the German lines, acting like a gambler, and unwilling to admit failure to the politicians who had relieved his predecessor, General French, of his duties.

<h3>Another International Aviation Race</h3>
<p>From Paris Directly to Vietnam</p>
<p>A Distance of 18,000 Kilometers</p>
<p>(Paris) Air Minister General Treillard is planning to organize an international aviation race between Paris and Hanoi, Vietnam. Several details of this have been published by the Petit Parisien newspaper. It is said that the flight distance is about 18,000 kilometers, comparable to the recent England-Australia air race. The route is roughly from Paris, passing through Rome, Corfu (in Greece), Beirut (the capital of French-mandated Syria), Baghdad, Bushehr (in the Persian Gulf), Jask (in southeastern Persia), Karachi, Jodhpur, Allahabad, Calcutta (all in India), Akyab (in Burma), Rangoon, Bangkok, Saigon, and reaching Hanoi. This plan has been under consideration for several weeks. Its purpose is not only to demonstrate France's attention to the aviation industry, but also to enhance the relationship between the mother country and the colonies in the Near East and Far East. Judging from the excellent results achieved in recent flights, air travel between Paris and Vietnam can be completed in less than 50 hours. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>England-Australia Air Race</h3>
<p>US Plane Ranked Fourth</p>
<p>Completes Journey in Less Than Five Days</p>
<p>Melbourne The plane driven by Jones and Waller, which took fourth place in the England-Australia air race, landed on Mount Isa in Queensland en route, and was able to fly to its final destination with the help of miners there. It was already dark at the time, and they could not find a landing spot, circling in the sky for a long time. Several miners realized this and took off their clothes, soaked them in gasoline, and burned them. As a result, the two aviators were able to land safely by the light. They then proceeded to Melbourne. The plane driven by McGregor and Walker landed in Darwin Harbor at 6:30 AM this morning, stopped for one hour and twenty-seven minutes, and then took off for Charleville. This plane can be estimated to be in fifth place in the race. The plane driven by Hewitt and Kay departed from Batavia for Rambang at 4:52 AM this morning and is currently in sixth place in the race. Of the other planes, the one driven by Lash arrived in Singapore at 7:41 AM this morning and left for Batavia 25 minutes later. The one driven by Hanson is still stranded in Alor Setar due to engine repairs. The one driven by Wright arrived in Jask, Persia, last night, and the one driven by Melrose had already flown from Rangoon this morning.</p>
<p>The plane driven by Jones and Waller, which took fourth place in this race, flew from London to Melbourne in less than five days. If it had been a week ago, this result would have broken all previous records, but it was surpassed by the three planes driven by Scott and others and was therefore ranked fourth. Jones and Waller may quickly fly back to England to create a record for round-trip flights between England and Australia. The Comet, the plane driven by Scott and Black, which won the championship, has been gifted to the two by its owner, Edwards, from London. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>All-India Congress to Convene to Vote on Gandhi's Future</h3>
<p>Political Program Leans Towards Socialism</p>
<p>Bombay The All-India National Congress Party, which is experiencing severe internal conflicts, will convene tomorrow. Tens of thousands of representatives will attend. While the demand for autonomy and opposition to British rule are consistent, opinions differ on how to fight British rule. Discussions on the party platform will be aimed at Gandhi. Gandhi has been the leader of the Indian National Congress Party for 15 years, but recently, voices of opposition have been incessant, and he has expressed his intention to retire. Therefore, this congress will also vote on Gandhi's future. If the congress wants to retain Gandhi, it must obey his principles of non-violent resistance, promoting household weaving, and reforming rural areas. If the congress adopts radical left-wing views, then Gandhi will inevitably withdraw himself. Observers say that Gandhi recently fasted for a week for the liberation movement of the Untouchables, and his body is weaker than before, but he is still the hope of the masses, so the result of the congress is that Gandhi's reputation will be even greater than before. Although there have been occasional opponents recently, the Indian masses still worship him as a saint. If the congress actually allows Gandhi to retire, then Nehru will take his place. He is younger and currently in prison. Nehru is the soul of the left wing, graduated from Oxford University, traveled extensively, and advocates rebuilding India as a socialist country.

<h3>US Bankers Association Resolves to Cooperate with the Government</h3>

This is the Bankers Association's response to President Roosevelt's request for bankers to provide loans. The first resolution states that current signs are encouraging, and general businesses are gradually needing more bank loans than before.

<p>(Washington) The American Bankers Association today implemented a new policy of close cooperation with the government, and unanimously supported President Roosevelt's recovery plan. The association's new president, Hagar, announced that he will meet with officials from the government's Export-Import Bank on Friday to discuss ways to develop US foreign trade. Hagar also said that the association has requested the Treasury Department to adopt a more lenient system for bank inspections, and a proposal is being drafted. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>German and Polish Envoys Promoted</h3>
<p>Sign of Cordial Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Warsaw The German legation in Poland and the Polish legation in Germany will both be upgraded to embassies from November 1 this year, and the ambassadors will be promoted from the current ministers of the two countries. This shows the daily improvement of relations between Poland and Germany. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers commented enthusiastically on the promotion of the German envoy to Poland to the rank of ambassador, calling the move recognition of Poland as a first-class country, and recognizing this as the first effect of the two countries establishing bilateral treaties based on mutual respect and trust, rather than multilateral treaties that only cause suspicion.

<h3>Unstable French Cabinet</h3>
<p>Radical Socialist Party Opposes Constitutional Amendment</p>
<p>Nantes The position of the French government is precarious today, because the Radical Socialist Party, the only most powerful party in Congress, is now opposing Prime Minister Doumergue's proposal to reform the constitution. The party convened a congress here today and passed a resolution criticizing Doumergue's proposal. It is expected that party leader Herriot's speech on Saturday will determine the party's attitude. However, most party members now feel that if Doumergue's government collapses, the party will also lose its glory, and it will inevitably be followed by political and social disturbances. Judging from the current situation, the party may entrust its leaders to persuade Doumergue to amend his proposal. As for Doumergue, if he is opposed by the Radical Socialist Party, he may have the right to dissolve Congress without the consent of the Senate. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Nantes Regarding the constitutional reform proposal, a compromise plan can probably be established. In the evening, someone said that the Radical Party had proposed a plan allowing the President, under certain conditions and with the consent of the cabinet, to dissolve the House of Representatives, but if these conditions are not met, the consent of the Senate is still necessary.

<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Suggests Four Countries Conclude New Pact</h3>
<p>Based on Polish-Hungarian Cultural Agreement</p>
<p>Rejected by Austrian Chancellor</p>
<p>Vienna During talks between Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya and Chancellor Schuschnigg, Kanya proposed to re-address the issue of the Danube River Basin and suggested that Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary conclude the same new pact based on the newly established Polish-Hungarian cultural agreement. The Hungarian Foreign Minister also said that this move would be enough to ease the current tensions, but it is reported that the Austrian government, following the instructions of the Italian government, has rejected this proposal. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Since Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös visited Warsaw, Hungarian and German newspapers have commented frequently. Polish public opinion is quite impatient with these discussions. Foreign newspapers have said that Gömbös's visit was intended to combine the Central European countries to form a group. The Polish government has instructed newspapers to avoid publishing these discussions, but right-wing opposition newspapers oppose this view, saying that Poland will never unite with Germany, Hungary, and Italy to form a Central European group, and allow Germany to take the lead.

<h3>Britain Attempts to Interfere in Egyptian Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Conflict Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(London) King Fuad I of Egypt has been ill for a long time and has been unable to attend to state affairs personally. The Egyptian constitution does not have provisions for others to act as regent when the king is ill. According to news from Cairo obtained in London, Egyptian Prime Minister Tawfiq Nasim Pasha discussed with the British Acting Agent in Egypt, Sir Peterson, the steps to be taken when the king is ill. At that time, Agent Lampson was still on leave. Peterson then discussed it with the British government and advised the Egyptian Prime Minister to appoint a new leader of the cabinet as the liaison between the King's cabinet and the High Commissioner. The position of High Commissioner has been vacant since 1931. The Egyptian Prime Minister was not very happy with this advice and accused Peterson of interfering in Egyptian internal affairs, and claimed that he had never discussed this matter with the British Agent. As a result, relations between Britain and Egypt are now slightly strained. The Egyptian Wafd Party and the Liberal Party have not expressed alarm about this diplomatic conflict, nor have they joined forces to support the government. According to news from Cairo, the Custodian of Royal Property, Ibrahim Bey, and two cabinet members have formed a triumvirate and have extraordinary influence in state affairs. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Closes</h3>
<p>Soviet Proposal Amended and Passed</p>
<p>Next Session to be Held in Madrid</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 15th International Red Cross Conference has in fact come to a close. Its final general assembly continued to be held from the 25th to the 26th, and the reports of the various committees have been approved. The Soviet representative proposed that the Red Cross should actively work to prevent war and set up a non-war international law. The amended full text is as follows:</p>
<p>In view of the results of the international conferences in Geneva and Brussels, the Red Cross should do its best to prevent war. However, with the advancement of modern tactics, the Red Cross is finding it difficult to deal with the tragedies of the battlefield. In view of this, the millions of precious lives saved by the Red Cross and the centuries of time spent should prevent the destruction of material and spiritual wealth. Under the mutual goodwill and understanding of the people of all countries, we hope to do our best to promote this.</p>
<p>The above proposal was amended and passed. The members of the association then attended a garden party convened by Baron Iwasaki at 3:00 PM and were invited to the Kabuki theater at 9:00 PM to watch a play. (Rengo, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the next International Red Cross Conference will be held in Madrid, the capital of Spain. (Rengo, 26th)</p>

<h3>An Observation of Osaka City (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Cities are exceptionally developed.</p>
<p>Socially, there is an abnormal boom.</p>
<p>Japanese rural areas have repeatedly suffered from drought (especially severe in the Kyushu region) and frost damage (most severe in the Hokuriku region). Furthermore, subsidiary industries such as silk have been affected by the sharp drop in silk prices, leading to a decrease in income amounting to as much as 300 million yen. Therefore, the countryside is particularly distressed, and the decline in economic power is extremely severe. The purchasing power of farmers is almost equivalent to zero. Consequently, many people in rural areas are showing signs of malnutrition.</p>
<p>However, cities are exactly the opposite. Many people above the middle class have benefited from the increase in foreign exports and the progress of light industry. Moreover, the infusion of military industries seems to be oblivious to any "recession," constantly expanding their businesses and moving forward. This is true not only for industrial capitalists and financial capitalists but also for salaried employees and laborers, most of whom are living happily, believing that the future is bright and without worries. As long as they don't lose their jobs, life in the city is very convenient, so their physiques are generally very healthy, and each one exhibits a plump appearance. Even the livestock they use are well-fed; scrawny horses are rarely seen. In Osaka, which is still recovering from recent wind and flood disasters, everyone is particularly busy engaging in reconstruction work. Streetcars, automobiles, and buses fill several important streets, fully demonstrating its industrial vigor.</p>
<p>However, one thing that particularly catches the attention of newcomers is the extraordinary number of coffee shops. Almost every street has one or two. The waitresses in each coffee shop, while not necessarily beautiful, are very charming and alluring, prepared to attract customers. Moreover, the prices of coffee and tea are surprisingly cheap. For example, a cup of coffee costs only five cents (about 4.5 fen in silver), and so does tea. Ice cream is also only five cents, and other snacks are at most twenty cents. In a coffee shop, you can listen to gramophones and radio broadcasts, and even joke around with the waitresses to relieve boredom. They don't ask for tips for this; in coffee shops, they only ask their employers to give them snack money.</p>
<p>Given the pure and simple social customs of Japan, why are there so many of these establishments? If the market isn't particularly thriving, why is there so much spending power? Why does the Japanese government, which is responsible for promoting good customs, allow the existence of such businesses? At first, I didn't understand, but after much investigation and research, I have come to grasp the relationship.</p>
<p>The habits of diligence, thrift, and simplicity used to permeate Japanese society as a whole. Now, young men and women, students, all wear Western-style clothing or very neat uniforms, and it's rare to see anyone wearing "wafuku" (traditional Japanese clothing). Their coats and leather shoes are mostly elaborate and well-polished. Originally, in general society, especially in large cities, because production has increased and industry has developed, general consumption has also grown, and the need for entertainment has arisen simultaneously. However, as a result of industrial development and the expansion of factories, the family system is no longer easily sustainable economically, so it is quite difficult for Japanese men to establish families because after having a family, they must bear the burden of supporting two or more people and the future education expenses of their children. Women, on the other hand, would rather engage in professional life and are unwilling to be housewives. There are also relatively more female workers employed in light industry, so most women rush into the professional world. Therefore, men demand after-hours entertainment, and the industrial sector cannot accommodate all the professional women. Coffee shops have emerged to meet the needs of both men and women.</p>
<p>Osaka is an industrial area, and workers make up the majority of the population. Japanese wages are generally not high, so their spending power is naturally limited. But their demand for entertainment is no less than others, especially for short-term entertainment during a busy schedule. It doesn't cost much and can slightly relax the tense emotions from work. Therefore, coffee shops are their only place for recreation. (Tokyo, October 20)</p>
<h3>Situation of Chairman Chiang's Visit to Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife Soong Mei-ling, Chief of Guard Xuan Tiewu, and advisor Donald, left Bian on a Ford airplane and flew north yesterday (the 24th) at 9:40 AM. At 1:10 PM, they arrived in Ji'nan and met with Han Fuqu and military and political personnel from Shandong Province. At 4:40 PM, they flew from Ji'nan and arrived at Nanyuan Airport in Beiping. Key military and political figures in Beiping had gone to Nanyuan several times in the past two days to welcome them, but their trips were in vain. After receiving confirmation yesterday, military and political organs immediately ordered the dispatch of military police to Nanyuan to maintain order. Security was tight along the route. The airport was even more meticulously arranged. Red flags were placed at the four corners of the airport to prohibit pedestrians from passing through. Yu Jinghe, the head of the Public Security Bureau, personally stood at the entrance of the airport to check incoming and outgoing personnel. Many key military and political figures arrived to welcome them, including Chairman Huang and his wife, as well as Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Song Zheyuan, Guan Linzheng, Ji Yiqiao, Bao Wen Yue, Men Zhizhong, Wei Yisan, Shao Wenkai, Gao Weiyue, Fang Juehui, Miao Peicheng, Ji Liang, Yuan Liang, and over two hundred others. Landing signs were placed in the field, and six wooden poles were erected to divide the standing positions for the welcoming personnel. From south to north, the front was for personnel from the Political Readjustment Committee, followed by personnel from the Military Branch Committee, then personnel from the Party Headquarters, fourth was representatives from various sectors, and fifth was for news media organizations. Each boundary was clearly defined and could not be crossed. At 4:40 PM, the Ford aircraft appeared in the sky, circled the field once, and then landed. Huang Fu and his wife greeted them at the front of the plane. After Chiang got off the plane, he exchanged greetings with the Huangs and then nodded to the welcoming personnel to express his gratitude. Chiang was wearing a Zhongshan suit, a felt hat, and a black cloak. His complexion appeared older than before, but his spirit was vigorous. After staying at the airport for a short while, he rode into the city with Huang in a car. Soong Mei-ling rode in the same car with Huang's wife. After Chiang left the airport, the welcoming personnel followed him into the city. There were many spectators as Chiang's car passed by. Tomorrow morning (the 26th) at 10:00 AM, the Beiping Municipal Government will hold a New Life Movement rally at the Public Security Bureau auditorium and invite Chiang to deliver a speech. Chiang will stay in Beiping briefly and then fly south. Secretary-General Yang Yongtai arrived from Zhengzhou yesterday on a special train. Chiang's guards, who traveled with him, arrived in Beiping today at 2:15 PM. Those who welcomed them at the West Station included Shang Zhen, Yuan Liang, Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Yu Jinghe, and over sixty others. After the train arrived at the station, the welcoming personnel boarded the train to greet them. Yang greeted them one by one. After leaving the station, they rode in cars prepared by the city government to their residence at Jurentang. Chiang's guards were stationed at Fengzeyuan. Yang rested briefly at his residence and then visited the Executive Yuan and Huang Fu. (October 25)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang's Speech at the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>My previous resignation was due to difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Now that the military and the people have spoken frankly, I must try harder.</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: In Sichuan Province, the bandit suppression army has recently shifted from defense to offense, achieving successive victories, and the people's hearts are gradually becoming more stable. The leaders of the various armies have all expressed sincerely that they are willing to do their best to clear up the atmosphere of banditry. After a meeting, Liu Xiang decided to formally resume his position as Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression on the 22nd. The Sichuan situation is showing a new look. Recent military news indicates that Xu bandits have suffered setbacks, and the bandits have been forcefully suppressed by the Sichuan army to the point that they can no longer form large groups. The bandits were attacked by the joint forces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, and their losses in personnel and weapons exceeded half. They are on the verge of collapse. The recent joint military-civilian bandit suppression conference in Sichuan Province had very good results and was a major key to improving the bandit suppression situation. The representatives of the various armies expressed their respect for the spirit of unity and obedience to Liu Xiang's orders in order to promote unification. Liu Xiang also gave an extremely moving speech, discussing the process of his resignation, financial methods, and the issue of local militias. All the major points he addressed were quite important, so excerpts from his speech are provided below:</p>
<p>Liu began by saying, "Today, as I gather with you all, I personally feel very ashamed. It is because I, burdened with the heavy responsibility of suppressing bandits throughout Sichuan, have not been able to properly manage the bandit suppression military affairs for more than a year, resulting in the failure of what was nearly a great achievement. I have not only deeply failed the central government's earnest trust and the Sichuan people's urgent expectations, but I also feel guilty about my own bandit suppression aspirations. I feel that the difficulties ahead are great, as proven by past facts, and that my meager efforts will not be enough to overcome them. Therefore, in late August, I resolutely blamed myself and resigned from my position to apologize to the Sichuan people. My decision at that time was purely to make way for someone more capable. The suppression of bandits in Sichuan, although limited to the northeastern corner of Sichuan, if the military and people of Sichuan are exhausted and run out of strength, it will inevitably lead to collapse and become unmanageable. This is a serious problem that must not be caused by me."</p>
<p>Liu then said, regarding his resignation, "It was definitely not out of self-preservation. It was because the past circumstances were too difficult. Although I exhausted my mind and efforts, I could not fulfill my responsibilities. For example, regarding the bandit suppression plan, although there were various regulations, due to the lack of effective control, only 30-40% of it was actually implemented. In terms of finance, for more than a year, only 4 million yuan was raised from the people, which was a drop in the bucket and could not solve the problem. However, I deeply know the suffering of the people and have tried my best to support it, and I am determined not to increase the burden on the people. Therefore, in the past period, the 21st Army borrowed 9 million yuan from merchants in the form of salt taxes and various other taxes. Now, including the interest, it is no less than 15 million yuan. We have exhausted all means, and not only are we currently running out of steam, but also the salary for the 21st Army for the past two or three years has been suspended. On the other hand, the bandit suppression military affairs, which were expected to be completed in a few months, are now expected to be delayed for more than a year. Soldiers are hungry on the front line, and people are crying in the rear. Even the cleverest woman cannot cook without rice. Therefore, although the central government has repeatedly sent telegrams of consolation and given many instructions for reorganizing discipline and deploying military affairs, I have always dared not accept the command because the financial problem has no effective solution. Even though I resigned, I am still a member of the Sichuan people, and how can I not love Sichuan and my country? Therefore, after going to Kaijiang to stabilize the front line, I followed the requests of various parties and returned to the provincial capital in my private capacity to explain the difficulties of my resignation, hoping to discuss with you how to reverse the crisis. In recent days, various parties have exchanged opinions, and the proposals you have made today are all in line with the situation. If they are implemented, it will not be difficult for the Sichuan situation to see the light again. While I am impressed and gratified, I also feel the weight of my previous responsibilities. But now that the military and the people are gathered together, speaking frankly, correcting past malpractices, and planning for future effectiveness, it is an opportunity for the Sichuan people to recover. I am personally involved in it, how can I not be moved? Since you have sincerely invited me to resume my position, I must try my best, like Feng Fu, and try my lead sword again. In terms of military affairs, the officers and soldiers in Sichuan can unify their will, unite their spirits, and wash away the previous concerns and evasions. Future bandit suppression victories can be asserted. However, military affairs must take into account both material and spiritual aspects. If the financial problem is not addressed, it is still difficult to be optimistic. I have thought deeply about the financial problem for a long time. Some people think that we must ask the central government to allow the issuance of a large amount of public bonds, but I do not entirely agree. The central government can only recognize the legal validity of the public bonds issued by Sichuan and still needs Sichuan to find its own way to sell them. Think about it, the various taxes in the area garrisoned by the 21st Army have already been mortgaged. What other guarantees can be given? Therefore, even if the central government can allow the issuance of public bonds, Sichuan itself still has no solution. This is very clear. Moreover, the people of Sichuan are poor and their wealth is exhausted. If we raise bonds within the province, we still have to take it from the people. How can the people bear it? Therefore, these public bonds must be issued outside the province. But at this time, the situation is not stable. How can people outside the province be willing to invest heavily? It is very clear that it is difficult to succeed. Therefore, at present, we can only prepare the procedures and wait until the military situation turns to our advantage, so that people outside the province know that the Sichuan situation is consolidated. Then we can raise funds and achieve twice the result with half the effort. As for the current military expenses, I plan to verify the various expenses and then ask the central government to provide 2 million yuan each month. If it is not enough, the people of Sichuan will bear the burden. When bandits come, it is the pain of the whole of Sichuan. Although the Sichuan people are poor, they must endure the pain to overcome the difficulties together."</p>
<p>Liu concluded by saying, "Regarding the local militia affairs throughout Sichuan, I believe that we must never repeat the mistakes of creating local warlords. The formation of local warlords is not only not beneficial to bandit suppression but also harmful to the local area. On the one hand, the people exhaust their resources to provide for the bandit suppression military expenses. On the other hand, they must also be subjected to the oppression of the local warlords, spending money and effort, and suffering the pain of being exploited. If we do not fundamentally change this, we will leave behind hidden dangers. We must know that the meaning of local militias today is purely for bandit suppression, and the focus is especially on politics. The Communists have already established various organizations for the people to use, while the majority of our people have no organization and are often taken advantage of by the Communist Party, increasing our concerns. What could be more misguided than this? I believe that in the future, the task of running local militias is to organize the people, strictly register households, and select young and strong people to divide them into two types: militia and laborers. The militia should be individually trained, roughly like the door-to-door training in the past. Not only should they have basic military skills, but they must also understand the obligations of the people to the country. The laborers do not need military training, but they must still understand the meaning of bandit suppression. Once the organization is established, it will be easy to mobilize them in the future, and it will also make the rear more stable. It will greatly facilitate the work of clearing out the Communists. This is a fundamental and essential plan."</p>
<p>Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Wuwei City and Countryside</h3>
<p>Wusheng Station has lush water and grass, and animal husbandry is developed. Each sheep sells for one silver dollar, and it is delicious and less gamey. However, the lodging is a Hui (Muslim) inn, and eating sheep requires asking a Hui Ahong (religious leader) to chant scriptures and slaughter it; otherwise, it is not allowed to be cooked. There are many foxes in the mountains, and hundreds of hides can be sold each year. There are thousands of wild birds in groups. The car manager, Mr. Tan, shot seventeen heads with three shots. He especially borrowed a Han stove to cook and eat them, but the meat was too tough to swallow. I stayed at the station for two days. After the rain stopped and the clouds cleared, I packed up and continued on the 19th. The forty-mile Chaikou Station has a prosperous population and a postal agency. I went to send a registered express letter. The agency had no printed forms, only a strip of white paper, and asked the sender to write the name and address of the recipient, and then stamped it with a stamp without a date as proof. Twenty miles to Zheliugou, twenty-five miles to Zhenqiang Station, there are few civilian houses, all scattered inside and outside the ancient fort.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the fields are barren, and the grass is deep. On the slopes of the distant mountains, rapeseed and buckwheat flowers are blooming in patches of yellow and white. Looking south, the high peaks of the Qilian Mountains suddenly appear between two nearby green mountains, towering and majestic, with strange peaks and white snow, inspiring a feeling of lofty purity. The Qilian Mountains are commonly called Tiger Mountains. By turning over the ice blocks in their ravines, one can pan for gold. The production of medicinal materials is also very abundant.</p>
<p>The Zhenqiang River is a confluence of melted snow and spring water. It was originally very clear and secluded, and irrigation was very convenient. Recently, due to heavy rains, it has turned into a rampant flood. The wooden bridges have all been washed away. The car crossed the river on the right bank and then climbed up the Wusong Ridge. There are no pine trees on the ridge. The elms and willows planted by Zuo Zongtang during his western expedition have mostly peeled and withered. There is not a single tree here. However, the green grass is abundant and fertile, which can be used for animal husbandry. At the top of the ridge is the Han Ancestral Temple, said to have been built by Zuo Zongtang, commonly called the Han Xiangzi Temple. Villagers from hundreds of miles away constantly come here to donate incense money and pray sincerely. The old Taoists, ten or more, also engage in animal husbandry, so their lives are prosperous. The mountains are high and the weather is cold here. The old Taoists often wear fur and cotton, and passers-by must also add clothes to prevent catching a cold. Thirty-five miles down the ridge is Anyuan Fort, with forty or fifty households. There is a small school, but no inn can accommodate a car. I went forward several miles and set up a tent on the grass. There is a clear stream nearby, which can be used to wash the car. The stream is also from mountain springs and snow water, clear and cold all year round, and its power can drive a mill. There is a village called "Youfangtang" (Oil Mill Pond) with a dozen households, relying on this for a living. The supplies for the military station, or when hungry people from other places ask for food, are all supplied by the mill.</p>
<p>On the 20th, I left Youfangtang. The places I passed, Heisong Station and Gulang Gorge, were all between two mountains. There were often huge rocks in the road, making it difficult for the car to travel. The gorge is forty or fifty miles long. The stream becomes larger and larger, and the current is very rapid. The sound of the water hitting the rocks is deafening. At the end of the gorge, it suddenly opens up, and Gulang County is in sight. The car drove past quickly, and I felt that the city had no lively atmosphere. Then, passing through Shuangtabao, Daxiao, Jingbian Station, Hedongbao, and Dahe Station, I arrived directly at Wuwei. The road is one hundred and thirty miles long and can be traveled easily. However, the villages have suffered a great change during the Tongzhi period. After sixty or seventy years, not only has the vitality not recovered, but the houses have become even more dilapidated, almost becoming ruins. In the boundless fields, although there is the benefit of mountain springs and snow water, they have not been managed for many years. If they are not overgrown with weeds, they are also flooded by mountain torrents. The desolate state is like the red areas recovered in Jiangxi. The scenery of the villages near Wuwei County is gradually getting better. The poppies and buckwheat planted have tall stalks and fat leaves, and the harvest is also considerable. However, every year there are flash floods, and no one knows how to prevent them, so good fields suddenly turn into piles of sand and gravel, and villages and houses are suddenly flooded. The rivers that run north and south through the county have thirty or forty branches, most of which are connected and can be guided back to the main stream, or reservoirs can be dug upstream, which can also be used for agricultural irrigation. However, no one has ever advocated for this, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Wuwei, formerly known as Liangzhou, is one of the four key locations in the Hexi Corridor of the Han Dynasty. It is bordered by the desert in the north, blocked by the snow mountains in the south, and the gorges in the east and west are particularly dangerous. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty opened up the border and established a meeting place here, isolating the Qiang Hu and cutting off the arm of the Xiongnu. During the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Former Liang Zhang Mao, the Later Liang Lu Guang, the Southern Liang Fa Wugu, the Northern Liang Juqu Mengxun, and the Western Liang Li Song successively occupied Hexi and used this as their base. Its importance is evident. Many famous historical sites, such as Qingyun Temple and Dazhong Temple, have collapsed and become desolate. There is an ancient Western Xia stele west of the city, inscribed with Western Xia characters, and few can decipher it. The city is twelve li in circumference and mostly barren land. The northwest corner is full of rocks, almost as if it is still in the riverbed. The teahouses and shops are lined up in rows and are quite lively. The garrison is repairing the road, making it wide and passable. New willows and poplars are planted along the road, with lush branches. Among them, there are three or four trees more than three zhang (about 10 meters) tall, which are particularly ancient and lovely. There are three theaters. It is the time when new opium is on the market (six or seven ounces can be bought for one yuan), and business is active. The theaters are often full. The reporter visited various agencies one after another, and many of the main people were out watching plays or said that they were celebrating because an official had taken a concubine.</p>
<p>The Wuwei Gospel Church was converted from the former residence of the Governor-General of Liangguang, Niu Jian, which was sold for a huge amount of money. It is large in scale and well-equipped, with a church and an attached elementary school. In the past, the church was quite prosperous, but now it is gradually declining. According to Mrs. He, the pastor of the church (an American), the lack of development of church affairs in the Northwest is not due to a bad environment, nor is it because the people are unwilling to approach the church. It is because the missionaries are unwilling to become one with the people. The most developed churches in China are in Henan. Henan is an ancient and modern battlefield, and the environment is not superior, but the missionaries can become one with the people. In peacetime, they run schools and set up hospitals. In wartime, they form special ambulance teams to fully express their spirit of serving society. Therefore, the people's impression of the church is getting better day by day, and the church is also benefiting more and more from the help of the people. Even churches run by foreigners are like this. If local officials disregard the benefits of the people, what kind of impression will they give to the people?</p>
<p>Mrs. He, an American woman, can wear a Chinese cheongsam and conduct church affairs in the interior of China. She made this startling statement, and her insights and spirit deserve our admiration. But from this, if we expect the church to seek pure and lasting benefits for our people, it is a big mistake. For example, this time when the car entered the city, it drove straight to the church. The manager, Mr. Tan, and the foreign driver were invited to stay inside, but the Chinese driver was told that because he might smoke, he had to find another hotel to stay in. In fact, none of the Chinese and foreign drivers did not smoke cigarettes. The psychology of discriminating against the nation cannot be concealed by chance. Also, a soldier suddenly saw a foreign car coming and asked loudly, "What country is he from?" A driver answered, "Japanese, Japanese." The driver was originally American. He did not directly answer that he was American, but knelt down and answered that he was Japanese. His intention was nothing more than two points: one, after the September 18th Incident, China was aroused to anger and was unanimously anti-Japanese, but I insisted on saying that he was Japanese to see how you would react; the other was that in the Battle of the Great Wall, Chinese soldiers were ultimately defeated (especially in the eyes of foreigners). I said that he was Japanese to see if you (the soldier) were afraid. Foreigners who come to China to do business are mostly peaceful people on the surface, but their nature of complimenting victory and despising failure can be seen anytime and anywhere. The Chinese people do not seek to improve themselves but hope to seek help from others. Even if foreigners lure us with candy, we regard them as having the virtue of recreating us. We should wake up now.</p>
<h3>The Political Strife in Zhongshan County, Guangdong, Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Liang Hongguang Temporarily Serves as County Magistrate</p>
<p>Tang Shaoyi Recovers in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the mutiny of county soldiers in Zhongshan County, the entire county fell into a state of anarchy. County Magistrate Tang Shaoyi was initially trapped in Tangjiawan. The newly appointed County Garrison Commander (appointed by Tang) Lin Jinghun, was detained by mutinous soldiers in Shiqi. The provincial military authorities immediately dispatched Luo Cequn, the commander of the training regiment, to lead troops to Zhongshan to maintain order and temporarily appointed Luo to also manage county affairs. Subsequently, the Southwest Political Council sent a warship to Tangjiawan to escort Tang Shaoyi to the provincial capital. After arriving in the provincial capital, Tang reported on the mutiny and then went to the hospital for treatment, stating his willingness to resign as county magistrate and requesting that someone be found to temporarily manage county affairs. Shortly afterward, he went to Hong Kong with his family to recuperate. All sectors of Zhongshan believed that county affairs could not</p>
<p>be without someone in charge. They convened a citizens' assembly and publicly elected respected locals to temporarily manage county affairs, presenting the five people with the most votes to the government for appointment. On the 16th, the Southwest Political Council held its 140th meeting to discuss the appointment of someone to act as the county magistrate of Zhongshan County. The decision was made that before a formal county magistrate is appointed, Liang Hongguang would temporarily serve as the acting county magistrate. Liang is from Zhongshan County and served as the county magistrate in the winter of 1927. He seems to be familiar with the local situation. After being appointed, he returned to Zhongshan on the 20th of this month to prepare to take office. If there are no obstacles, the inauguration is scheduled for the 23rd at noon. The issue of the Zhongshan County magistrate seems to have come to an end. As for the Zhongshan Self-Defense Force and the Shatin area, the province has also sent people to take over management. It is understood that the Zhongshan County Guard has been established in various districts and is quite strong. In order to reorganize the county guard officers, the provincial military authorities have dispatched Xue Hanguang to take over the entire Zhongshan County Guard, appointing Xue as the deputy director of the Zhongshan County Guard Training Office (the director is usually concurrently held by the county magistrate). After arriving in the county, Xue has begun to coordinate guard funding, eliminate the old and weak, concentrate training, and allocate defense areas. On the 19th, he returned to the province to report everything to the authorities. The Zhongshan Shatin area has also been taken over by Chen Peibiao and other special commissioners sent by the Department of Finance. Chen and others have already taken over the Zhongshun Shatin donation fees, clear field registration taxes, bills, public property, instruments, books, and documents. A new office has been established to handle Zhongshun Shatin fees, and the original East and West Sea Shatin agencies in Zhongshan County have been abolished. Shatin tax collectors have been appointed to handle affairs separately, and the Zhongshan Shatin Protection Team has been reorganized into the Sixth Battalion of the Shatin Protection Army. In addition, recently, the people of Zhongshan County have unanimously requested that the county government be moved back to the old site in Shiqi, as the current location in Tangjiawan is too far from the city. This is expected to be realized. As for Tang Shaoyi, he is still recuperating on a foreign island. Regarding the recent county affairs, he sent a telegram to all parties reporting the entire incident, which is included below: "Yi, an aging old man, was reluctantly appointed to manage this county. Suddenly, a mutiny occurred, and I was terrified and became critically ill. Previously, while ill, I could not offer any assistance. Fortunately, I came to Hong Kong for medical treatment on the 15th. Fearing that there would be false rumors and distortions of the truth, I respectfully present the truth to avoid being misled by hearsay. The reason is that I overtrusted and delegated too much authority. Lin Shuwei held four positions: Director of the Public Security Bureau, Commander of the County Garrison, Director of the Shiqi Public Security Branch, and Deputy Director of Training. He held all the military and police power of the county, and all the officers and soldiers under his command were replaced with his relatives and friends. I had long feared that the handle of power would be turned against me, and that trouble would eventually arise from within. Sure enough, in the winter of this month, Director Lin urgently submitted his resignation from all his concurrent positions. Despite my attempts to retain him, I was unsuccessful. The next day, I approved his resignation and appointed local people to take over.</p>
<p>I ordered him to be cautious and responsible before handing over his duties. But as soon as the order approving his resignation was issued, Lin immediately dispatched soldiers and generals, and deployed defenses in Shiqi. At noon, his younger brother, Lin, led his troops to Tangjiawan, surrounded the public hall, and detained the newly appointed County Garrison Commander, Lin Jinghun, confining me in my office. County administration was halted, and the people were terrified. Regiment Commander Luo of the Fish Training Regiment had arrived in Shiqi under orders, but had not yet sent troops to Tangjiawan. Therefore, the rebellious soldiers continued to impose a strict blockade. I was subjected to armed oppression, akin to imprisonment. Only at noon did I receive a warship sent by the Commander-in-Chief of the Political Council to escort me out of danger to the provincial capital for recuperation. After investigation, the garrison funds had been clearly issued. On the 10th of this month, Director Lin had personally received them for safekeeping. At that time, all was peaceful and there were no reports of banditry. The so-called riot and defense against bandits were all excuses. In summary, his mutinous behavior clearly demonstrates an attempt to organize an organization to destroy the law and disrupt order. Nothing could be more extreme. If this is merely regarded as a county-level dispute and the ringleaders are not punished, how can the party survive, how can the nation stand? I am old and ill, my presence or absence is insignificant. I will hand over the county seal to Regiment Commander Luo for temporary management. I blame myself for using the wrong people and failing to quell the rebellion. I have failed to live up to the government's trust and the people's expectations for governance. I should urgently plead guilty and request the government to send personnel to handle the matter and severely punish the perpetrators to maintain law and order. I also request the government to steadfastly uphold the model county laws of Zhongshan, and not abolish them because of my departure, compounding my sins. Tang Shaoyi respectfully kowtows."</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Government has established a Tobacco Control Committee to handle tobacco control affairs throughout the province. Five people have been appointed by the Department of Finance, and two people have been elected from among the leaders of tobacco manufacturers to form the committee. Yesterday, on the 19th, the Department of Finance dispatched Wen Zhongqi, Sun Jiajie, Huang Qizong, Zhu Xinmo, and Lei Peihan as members of the committee, and designated Wen, Sun, and Huang as standing committee members to preside over everything. After being appointed, the members organized the Tobacco Control Committee on the same day and immediately began working. In the future, all cigarettes (excluding cigars) sold within Guangdong, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign products, will have their monthly sales volume and selling prices determined by the Control Committee. All existing Chinese and foreign merchants who manufacture cigarettes within the province, or manufacture and import them from other provinces or regions but have management offices in this province, must declare to the Control Committee and obtain a control certificate before they can be sold. At the same time, the Control Committee will</p>
<p>stipulate that, from now on, the prices of all kinds of cigarettes will be increased by 20% based on the wholesale price, and cigarettes will be sold at the new price. The increased selling price will be paid by the manufacturer to the Control Committee at the time of factory exit or warehouse exit, and then transferred to the Department of Finance to be used as funds for Guangdong's construction projects. The Control Committee has now officially announced the Tobacco Control Regulations, which will be implemented from the 20th. The original text of the regulations is recorded below:</p>

Article 10: The selling price of cigarettes shall be determined by the Control Committee. From the date of implementation of these regulations, the prices of all kinds of cigarettes shall be increased by 20% based on the wholesale price, and cigarettes shall be sold at the new price. Tobacco merchants shall not arbitrarily change the prices. Article 11: The increased selling price in the preceding article shall be paid by the tobacco merchant to the Control Committee at the time of factory exit or warehouse exit, and then transferred to the Department of Finance to be used as funds for Guangdong's construction projects. Article 12: If the cigarettes with increased prices become unsalable due to deterioration, the Tobacco Control Committee shall refund the increased selling price in full after verifying and destroying them in conjunction with the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Unified Tax Bureau. Article 13: All cigarettes sold in Guangdong must be inspected by the Control Committee and affixed with a control certificate on the box at the time of factory exit or import.

Article 15: If the selling price of cigarettes must be changed due to business needs, the tobacco merchant must submit an application to the Control Committee for approval before the change can be made.

<h3>Provincial Officials Sent to Review After Autumn Survey</h3>
<p>Since Kunshan entered [the period of] drought, the autumn harvest has suffered. According to the survey results reported by various districts to the county, the area of farmland where there was no harvest at all was 111,708 mu. The county assessment percentage after the county survey was determined to be 7.8875, which has been reported to the provincial government for approval. Gentlemen Xu Mengying and Li Jie, in view of the fact that the county has suffered from drought nine out of ten years and this year's drought is particularly severe, the disaster-stricken farmers have no money for food and clothing, but the autumn survey committee refused to remove the wasteland due to the limitations of the regulations. Yesterday, they telegraphed the provincial departments separately, requesting them to send officials to review and explicitly order the removal of the wasteland in order to alleviate the people's difficulties, and requested that the relief association be ordered to allocate funds for relief.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Peasant Riot Has Been Quelled; Tax Collectors Continue to Organize Groups to Survey Wasteland</p>
<p>Farmers in the areas of Xietang Chefang and Kuitang outside Loumen in Suzhou, due to this year's drought disaster, the tax collectors in various villages reported the wasteland unrealistically, and the wasteland survey was unfair. Suddenly, they gathered crowds to riot and set fire to the residences of more than 30 tax collectors and township chiefs, creating a state of terror in the four villages. After the county government sent officials to the villages to persuade [the farmers] earnestly and the provincial security office sent a hundred soldiers to suppress [the riot], the turmoil was quelled. The public security organs of various villages have successively arrested more than a dozen instigators and suspects, who are all detained in the public security bureau. County Magistrate Wu decided to give them administrative punishments as a warning. Wang Bolin, director of the public security bureau, set off on the 25th to inspect the various villages where the incidents occurred, such as Xiecheng. After this incident occurred, the wasteland survey committee temporarily suspended the wasteland survey to avoid accidents. Now that the turmoil has been quelled, officials will be sent in four groups to continue the wasteland survey in various villages, and the security team and the water police will provide protection along the way.</p>

<p>Five Types of Collateral, Term of Four and a Half Years</p>
<p>First Installment of 750,000 Yuan Already Disbursed</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, in order to complete the Huainan Railway, the National Construction Committee has continued to borrow 3.7 million yuan from the twelve banks of the Shanghai China Communications and others.

The allocation of loans to each bank is reported to be 700,000 yuan each for China and Communications Banks, 300,000 yuan for the Postal Savings Bureau, 500,000 yuan each for the Four Banks and Shanghai Bank, and the remaining 1 million yuan to be borne by the other five banks.</p>
<h3>Phased Disbursement</h3>
<p>The loan has been scheduled for disbursement in five phases, once every three months after the signing of the contract, with 750,000 yuan each time, and 700,000 yuan in the fifth phase, totaling 3.7 million yuan. The China and Communications Banks will serve as the representative banks, responsible for handling the disbursement of funds and the repayment of principal and interest. The first installment of 750,000 yuan has already been disbursed by the lending banks in proportion and paid to the China Bank for delivery to the Construction Committee. In order to supervise the use of the huge loan, the banking consortium will send two auditors to check the progress and use of the project at any time, as well as audit the business status of the collateral.</p>
<h3>Banks Discuss Contract for Suzhou Public Bonds as Collateral</h3>
<p>Formal Signing Possible After Number Allocation Determined</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the matter of using Suzhou Province's Water Conservancy Construction Bonds to borrow 8 million yuan from the Shanghai banking community, after successful negotiations between the Suzhou Finance Director and the banking consortium, a draft loan contract has been drawn up, and a formal signing will be possible once the banks agree. The following details were obtained by a reporter from the Central News Agency:</p>
<h3>Allocation of Funds</h3>
<p>Of the 8 million yuan borrowed against the Suzhou Province Water Conservancy Construction Bonds, 500,000 yuan will be borrowed from the Central Bank at a 50% discount using 1 million yuan of public bonds. Other banks will borrow 7.5 million yuan at a 60% discount using 12.5 million yuan of public bonds. Although the amount of lending by each bank has not been determined, it is generally settled, with the Bank of China lending more than 1 million yuan, the Bank of Communications approximately 1 million yuan, and other banks such as Shanghai, Zhongnan, Dalu, Jiangsu, the Four Banks, as well as the Suzhou Provincial Farmers' Bank and the Postal Savings Bureau, lending several hundred thousand yuan each. Xu Baoying, the general manager of the Jiangsu Bank, is currently representing the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Clauses</h3>
<p>Due to the Bank of China's proposal, it was decided to jointly draft a general contract to be signed by each lending bank and the Suzhou Provincial Government. The draft contract has been prepared by the Suzhou Finance Department and sent to various banks in Shanghai a few days ago. Meetings were held in the Bank of China conference room the night before last and yesterday afternoon to discuss the contract clauses. Approximately 20 representatives from various banks attended, and after careful study, the original draft was revised and passed and sent back to the Finance Department. Once the allocation of borrowing amounts for each bank is determined, a date can be set for signing. At that time, Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Suzhou Finance Department, will also come to Shanghai to sign.</p>
<h3>Contract Content</h3>
<p>As for the content of the contract, according to the reporter's inquiries, in addition to specifying the loan amount and the amount borrowed by each bank, the interest rate is 8% per week, and principal and interest will be repaid once every March and September. The repayment period is not specified, as the loan is secured by public bonds, and the drawing of lots for the repayment of public bonds is scheduled to take place every March and September. If the lending consortium holds winning bonds, they will be repaid, and then each bank will apportion the repayment of principal and interest according to the loan amount. Therefore, the repayment period cannot be predetermined in the contract. It is also stipulated that a Supervisory Committee for Expenditure and a Foundation Management Committee will be organized, and their regulations are yet to be drafted. The members will be officials from Suzhou and representatives from the banks, and the banking consortium will have representatives participating in the standing committees of both committees.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Gentry Telegraph Provincial Government Regarding Provincial Bonds</h3>
<p>Korean Gyun and others jointly telegraph the government regarding provincial bonds.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has issued 20 million yuan of provincial bonds, most of which are designated for water conservancy construction in southern and northern Jiangsu, which is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people of Jiangsu Province. The Jiangsu gentry attaches great importance to this matter. Yesterday, Korean Gyun, Zhang Yipeng, and others jointly telegraphed the government, requesting the announcement of storage and management methods. The original telegram is as follows: "Our Suzhou is an agricultural province. The Grand Canal has overflowed twice in ten years. This year's drought has caused huge losses, according to statistics. All this is due to the poor state of water conservancy. Judging from the harvests of various counties, there is definite evidence. Now, the provincial government has resolutely decided to raise 20 million yuan of provincial bonds, announcing its use for dredging various rivers in southern Jiangsu, opening up new canals in northern Jiangsu, and dredging the abandoned Yellow River into the sea. These are all great plans to avoid droughts in southern Jiangsu and increase production in northern Jiangsu. The determination is admirable. However, at a time when all industries are in decline and finances are depleted, it is difficult to raise such a large sum of money. All of us Suzhou people, experiencing the suffering, will inevitably work together to achieve success. We believe that since the government has difficulty raising funds in the first place, it must be careful in using the funds afterward. We are confident that you have wisdom and have already decided on the key points of storing and strictly managing all special funds. We request that you announce them clearly, so that not only will the people benefit in reality, but also great trust will be shown throughout the world. The raising, management, and expenditure of these bonds should follow a set of rules from now on, so that the government and the people can see each other's shared interests. We rely entirely on you. We jointly telegraph our urgent request, awaiting your instructions. Korean Gyun, Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Yipeng, Pang Shusen, Huang Yanpei, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Taoyi, Yang Shoumei, Qian Yizhen, Jin Qibao, Leng Yu, Lu Xigeng, Yan Dunhe, Ma Shijie, Jiang Hengyuan, Zhang Xiaoruo, Xu Zhaojun, Su Zongzhe, Liu Bochang, Luo Huizhuang, Wu Peijun, Wang Baohuai, Ji Longtu, Zhu Shaowen, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association and Others Support Disaster Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Jointly Telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Provincial Government to Unanimously Advocate</p>
<p>The Disaster in Zhejiang is Severe and Relief is Urgently Needed to Maintain People's Livelihoods</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, and other organizations received a express telegram yesterday from the Zhejiang Beijing Fellow Townsmen Association, stating that Zhejiang Province has been suffering from prolonged drought, and the people's food supply is worrying. They have specifically requested the Executive Yuan to issue 20 million yuan of disaster relief bonds and sent a letter through Village Head Jiang Jieshi to the President of the Executive Yuan to promptly issue them in order to maintain people's livelihoods. The association, upon receiving the telegram, expressed its support and jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Provincial Government to unanimously advocate for it. The original texts of the Zhejiang Beijing Fellow Townsmen Association's presentations to the Executive Yuan and Chairman Jiang are recorded below:</p>
<p>Presentation to the Executive Yuan: Regarding the severe disaster in Zhejiang, urgent relief is needed, and we earnestly request the prompt approval and issuance of disaster relief bonds to save people's lives and maintain security. Our association recently received reports from various counties in Zhejiang, stating that this year's drought has resulted in no harvest of early rice, and the late planting of late rice and miscellaneous grains has yielded very little. It is heartbreaking to see farmers in our hometown committing suicide with their families every day. Some counties have a 30% harvest, but the costs of labor are too high, and it is not worth it. Moreover, when pumping water during the drought, the field ridges and soil embankments have been largely damaged. The spring flood season is approaching, and there are no funds to repair the embankments. After the drought, floods are feared to be inevitable. Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, and there are scenes of misery everywhere. Clothing and food are mostly gone. The old and weak are filling ditches, and the strong are gathering to cause trouble, robbing rice stores and eating the big households, which has already been seen frequently. This year's winter defense and local security are even more unimaginable. Our Zhejiang is close to Fujian and Jiangxi, and only a short distance from Beijing and Shanghai. If 20 million disaster victims are not given prompt relief, and if they take risks and are taken advantage of by bandits, it will not only devastate Zhejiang Province but also shake the capital and endanger the whole country. The severity of this disaster and the urgency of relief have long been understood in the official reports and newspaper articles. Our association reported the situation of the disaster in July, and stated that the province's financial resources were exhausted and unable to provide relief, and requested the Central Government to issue large sums of money to provide emergency relief. The people of our Zhejiang have always had heavy local burdens and fulfilled many obligations to the Party and the country. They have suddenly suffered a severe disaster, and the Central Government should provide substantial relief. According to reports, your Yuan is planning to issue 20 million yuan of disaster relief bonds at the request of our association, specifically for emergency relief. Our association believes that the disaster area is vast, the disaster is severe, and there are many disaster victims. 20 million yuan is just a drop in the bucket. However, according to recent reports, the Central Government has not yet issued the disaster relief bonds that are urgently needed, while the Zhejiang provincial local bonds have been approved first. It is said that the local bonds are for developing local production and consolidating local debts, and have nothing to do with emergency disaster relief. We believe that there is a priority and urgency in matters. Our association requested disaster relief first, and the provincial government requested the issuance of bonds later. Disaster relief is more urgent than construction, and saving lives is more important than repaying debts. The Central Government should worry about the people's worries and do what is most urgent. The world has never seen a barren land where production can be discussed. If the local area is not stable, how can construction be carried out, and how can production be increased? The old debts should be cleared from the past. It is not allowed to put the cart before the horse, and there should be a priority in the urgent and the slow. Our association cannot bear to see our hometown in deep water and fire. Therefore, we earnestly request your Yuan to issue the 20 million yuan of disaster relief bonds in advance, and designate the use of the bonds specifically for providing clothing and food, stabilizing rice prices, providing emergency relief, as well as afforestation, well digging, dike repair, and embankment construction for disaster prevention. It should not be used for other purposes, so that it can be done realistically to save the disaster victims and appease the people. As for production and construction, using labor instead</p>
<p>of relief is not a fundamental plan in Zhejiang at present, and it will only cause more trouble. It is feared that the local authorities will borrow money in the name of raising funds, dig meat to patch sores, and officials will be demanding, while the people will not receive real benefits, taking advantage of the fire to rob, which is truly heartbreaking. Food is the people's heaven, and the people are the foundation of the country. We have always admired your seat for caring about the people's suffering and understanding governance. Zhejiang is the focus of the southeast, and close to the capital, and its safety is of great importance. This request to issue disaster relief bonds to relieve the people's suffering is not only to plead for the fathers and brothers in our hometown but also a major plan for the Party and the country. We humbly request your prompt approval and implementation. In the autumn wind, we cannot help but await your instructions with urgency. Respectfully presented to Executive Yuan President Wang (omitted below).</p>
<p>Presentation to Chairman Jiang: Greetings to Village Head Jieshi. Our Zhejiang has been suffering from prolonged drought this year. Due to poor water conservancy, the disaster is particularly severe. The late rice has not been planted in time, and the miscellaneous grains have all been dried up. As a result, everything is expensive, and rice prices are soaring. From summer to autumn, grain merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard, and refugees are crying on the roads. Carrying burdens, they are sleeping in the open air, and eating in the wind. Their faces are haggard, and they are begging from door to door. Although they are willing to sell their wives and children to seek survival, everyone is in the same boat, and who will take care of them? Therefore, there have been frequent reports of whole families committing suicide and entire families starving to death. Which one is not a father, brother, or son from our hometown? Soon, the west wind will gradually tighten, and the water will become deeper. If the government does not provide urgent relief, the brave will inevitably take risks, and the cunning will become traitors to the enemy. The signs of this have already been seen in various counties in eastern Zhejiang. Our Zhejiang is adjacent to Jiangxi and Fujian, and close to the capital. Without a plan for appeasement, the harm will be great. The Executive Yuan previously planned to issue 20 million yuan of disaster relief bonds for disaster relief. The people of our hometown are deeply grateful for the government's concern. Unexpectedly, the provincial government wanted to use its name for other purposes. After unanimous protests from the people of Zhejiang, it was changed to local bonds in order to avoid opposition, beautifying its name as developing local industries and consolidating debts. Regardless of the fact that disaster relief is more urgent than construction, and saving lives is more important than repaying debts, at this time of chaos and famine, it is scraping the people of Zhejiang's cream and blood for slow-moving tasks, which will inevitably be used by bandits as an opportunity to incite trouble, and trap the Zhejiang situation in an unmanageable state. Therefore, we earnestly request your leadership to consider our homeland, and have pity on these disaster victims. Telegraph the President of the Executive Yuan to continue to issue disaster relief bonds, and specify their use specifically for providing clothing and food, stabilizing rice prices, providing emergency relief, as well as afforestation, well digging, dike repair, and embankment construction for disaster prevention. It should not be used for other purposes, and strict measures should be taken to prevent embezzlement. It is best to convene fair-minded gentry from the old eleven prefectures to discuss the measures publicly, and be responsible for carrying out the measures, so that the funds are not wasted and the disaster victims each receive real benefits. The virtue of saving lives will be immortal. If the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities believe that construction is also an urgent task, they may issue construction bonds separately for construction purposes. After all, disaster relief is one thing, and construction is another. In addition to presenting this directly to the Executive Yuan, we also send this letter for your judgment. We await your instructions with urgency. Please consider, (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Suzhou Finance Department Proceeds to Purchase Grain</h3>
<p>A Budget of 1.8 Million Yuan Entrusted to Banks for Handling</p>
<p>To Provide Food for 160,000 Workers Dredging the Huai River into the Sea</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Jiangsu Finance Department has already issued 20 million yuan of Water Conservancy Construction Bonds, and the loan secured by the bonds will also be successfully negotiated with the Shanghai banking community. The dredging of the Huai River into the sea is about to begin, but this project requires approximately 160,000 workers, and the amount of food required is quite large. In order to prepare in advance, 1.8 million yuan has been raised and entrusted to the four banks of Shanghai, Communications, Jiangsu, and Farmers to purchase grain on their behalf. Special commissioners have been dispatched to various locations to work with the branches of the banks to carry out the purchase and to set up more than ten grain stations for storage. On one hand, the Jiangsu Provincial Civil and Financial Departments are planning to jointly purchase grain to suppress merchants from deliberately raising prices.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Visited the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>After National Government Chairman Lin Zichao came to Shanghai for medical treatment, this morning, Mr. Lin received Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Land Bureau Director Jin Liren at his residence at 9:40 AM, and had a conversation for about 20 minutes. Then, at 10:10 AM, he accepted Mayor Wu's invitation and went to visit the new building of the municipal government in the city center with the mayor. Mr. Jin also followed in his own car to go to the bureau to work. He arrived at the municipal government at 10:35 AM and first rested briefly in the mayor's office. Then, Mayor Wu, Secretary General Yu Hongjun, and Secretary Tang Tuxuan accompanied him to visit the various departments of the municipal government, as well as the Social, Education, Public Works, Health, and Land Bureaus, and the public sports field that has begun construction. Chairman Lin expressed his great appreciation. He returned to his residence for rest at 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Run on the China Industrial Bank Subsided Yesterday</h3>
<p>Affected by the Closure of the China Industrial Development Bank</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank on Beijing Road in Shanghai was affected by the closure of the China Industrial Development Bank, causing misunderstandings and a small run yesterday morning, but it quickly subsided. According to reliable sources in the banking community yesterday, the small run on the Industrial Bank was completely affected by the closure of the Industrial Development Bank. The China Industrial Bank was registered with the government in 1919 and is a member of the Banking Association. In recent years, its business has been quite prosperous, its credit has been outstanding, and its reserves have been substantial. Therefore, although there were such rumors yesterday, they soon subsided. All banks, major companies, stores, and tobacco shops in the city continued to accept the bank's banknotes as usual. It is also understood that in order to maintain its reputation, the bank specifically extended its business hours by one hour yesterday, closing at 5:00 PM. It is estimated that the bank paid out only seven or eight thousand yuan in cash yesterday.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Promotion Association Reforms Customs and Rituals</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, based on the suggestion of Municipal Police Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, has revised and passed measures to reform customs and rituals through the third meeting of its executive committee, and is promoting them uniformly. An excerpt of the original text is provided below: "Our nation is founded on the principles of propriety and education. However, with the passage of time, formalities have increased, gradually losing their original meaning, leading to lamentations about the loss of tradition. Extended to the present day, customs have become deeply entrenched, and the word 'propriety' has not only become a mere formality, but money and time are wasted for no reason, which is deeply regrettable. As we are now vigorously promoting the New Life Movement, it is essential to change these customs. Therefore, we have listed common and familiar practices in separate articles, so that we, as comrades, can encourage each other. We hope that our observations and insights will contribute, however small, to the improvement of our society."</p>
<p>(A) Wedding Ceremony: The wedding ceremony is meant to signify the union of a man and a woman, and to inform relatives and acquaintances. It should not involve excessive displays of extravagance. In the past, during the imperial era, ceremonial guards were used to indicate official rank. However, the practice of ceremonial guards for officials has been abolished, making their use in weddings even less justifiable. Therefore, the use of ceremonial guards must be eliminated. Using palace lanterns for guidance may still have symbolic meaning, but even these should not be excessive. As for celebratory banquets, they are especially unnecessary. Guests come to witness the ceremony, not merely to indulge in lavish meals. Simple tea and refreshments will suffice. As for the boisterous "newlywed room" custom, it is an outdated practice and has already been abolished in major cities, so there is no need to discuss it further. (1) Wedding invitations should be sent out in advance, but only to close relatives and acquaintances, not indiscriminately. (2) No celebratory banquet should be held; instead, simple tea and refreshments should be provided. However, staff members may be provided with a simple meal. (3) All ceremonial guards should be abolished, but guiding lanterns may be used. (4) The band should consist of nine to thirty-two musicians. (5) The wedding ceremony should last no more than two hours. (6) Guests should arrive punctually at the designated time. (7) The bride and groom should wear ordinary formal attire, but it must be made of domestically produced materials.</p>
<p>(B) Funeral Ceremony: The funeral ceremony should be characterized by mourning and sorrow. Expressions of grief for the deceased and condolences for the living should be determined based on the relationship involved. If one knows the living, one should offer condolences; if one knows the deceased, one should express mourning. Since one is expressing grief and mourning, one should not be preoccupied with food. Therefore, Confucius, when eating near someone in mourning, never ate his fill. If one cannot eat one's fill even when one must eat, how can one indulge in lavish food and drink at the time of mourning before the coffin? (1) The time for offering condolences should be in the morning, based on the time notified by the bereaved family. (2) The bereaved family should not provide food and drink, but staff members may be provided with a simple meal. (3) Death notices should not be sent out indiscriminately, but only to close relatives and acquaintances. (4) Death notices should not list former Qing Dynasty official titles or meaningless eulogies. (5) If there are religious requirements involving scripture chanting and sacrificial offerings, they should be limited to one day. (6) During the funeral procession, only the band, spirit tablet, lanterns, and torches should be used; no other ceremonial guards should be used. (7) This does not apply to those who have contributed to the Party and the nation or are revered by society and already have specific rituals.</p>
<p>(C) Birthday Celebrations: The word "longevity" should only be used for those who are at least fifty years old. Nowadays, some people in their twenties or thirties celebrate their birthdays with great fanfare. In that case, Yan Hui, who died at the age of thirty-two, would not be considered short-lived, which is entirely illogical. Even more absurd are celebrations of posthumous birthdays. After all, when a person dies, it is said that they have reached the end of their life. Having reached the end of their life, how can one speak of longevity? Therefore, there should be restrictions on celebrating the birthdays of the living, and posthumous birthday celebrations should be abolished immediately to prevent the evil practices of deception and extortion. (1) Children celebrating the birthdays of their elders are not prohibited, but such celebrations should begin at the age of fifty. Those under fifty should not celebrate birthdays. (2) Each table at the birthday banquet should not exceed eight yuan. (3) Servants may be provided with a simple meal, but no transportation or meal allowances should be given. (4) Prostitutes should not be hired to provide entertainment with wine. (5) The birthday banquet should last no more than two hours. (6) Those offering birthday wishes should not do so after noon. (7) Those offering birthday wishes should bow as a gesture of respect and should not kneel or prostrate themselves. (8) Birthday invitations should not be sent out indiscriminately, but only to close relatives and friends. (9) Posthumous birthday celebrations should be absolutely abolished, but ancestral sacrifices by family members are not included in this restriction.</p>
<p>(D) Social Gatherings: The tradition of banquets originated from sacrificial offerings and sharing the spoils, not daring to enjoy them alone, so they must be shared with relatives and friends, so that children can understand the order of seniority, and learn the rules of etiquette. Therefore, inland invitations for wine and banquets all have a certain time of year, such as spring wine, New Year's wine, Lantern Festival wine, Dragon Boat Festival, Qingming Festival, ancestor worship, etc., which are generally after sacrificial offerings, and then banqueting relatives and friends, which is still keeping the ancient meaning.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The saying that scholars do not kill chickens for no reason and must have sacrificial offerings before killing livestock means the same thing. Nowadays, in Shanghai, every year at the end of the lunar year, relatives and friends are invited to eat New Year's Eve dinner, and the dishes are generally the items used for sacrificial offerings, which is also this meaning. As the business of wine and tea houses has flourished, the number of banquets has also increased, with guests being invited for a reason or no reason at all, and the extravagance and abundance have become commonplace, costing tens of yuan per table. The order of seniority and the etiquette of etiquette are all ignored, and people gather in a confused manner, chatting, laughing, and joking, and dispersing in a chaotic manner after eating. The word "propriety" has long disappeared, and the time is not fixed, with lunch sometimes being served after noon and dinner sometimes being served at dusk. Guests are often kept waiting for two or three hours or more, which is extremely time-consuming and wasteful. Here, we propose to make some restrictions on the left: (1) No banquets should be held without reason. (2) The dishes for banquets should not exceed eight yuan per table. (3) The banquet time should be limited to two hours. (4) Invited guests must arrive on time; otherwise, they will not be waited for. (5) Servants should not be paid for transportation or meals. (6) Prostitutes should not be hired to provide entertainment with wine. (7) All facilities should be simple and frugal.</p>
<p>(E) Gift-Giving: Giving gifts is commonly called "human sentiment" or "reciprocity." Therefore, people often check how much they have received in the past and give a corresponding gift in return, which is also very illogical. Since it is called "human sentiment," then the emphasis should be on the sentiment, not on the material things. Customs tend towards extravagance and flattery, and some people use gift-giving as a means to achieve their sycophantic goals, which is extremely shameful. I, Tianxu, advocate that candles should be given as gifts, as they can convert carbon dioxide in the room into oxygen and dispel misfortune, which is more meaningful. It is also said that in the past, in rural areas, gifts of money were no more than three or four cents of silver, and six cents was considered a generous gift, and some even gave hundreds of copper coins. Even if we cannot compare to the past, we can set a limit in moderation, with four yuan being the maximum, so that the recipient does not lose face and the giver does not lose heart. Therefore, we have drafted the following restrictions: 1. For weddings, funerals, birthdays, and other events, gifts should be limited to three types: candle coupons, gift certificates, and items. 2. Candle coupons should range from one to five catties. 3. Gift certificates and items should not exceed four yuan. 4. For those with a monthly salary of one hundred to two hundred yuan, the maximum gift should be two yuan. 5. For those with a monthly salary of more than two hundred yuan, the maximum gift should be four yuan. 6. Items should be domestically produced and practical. 7. Those who are not acquainted should not give gifts, even if they receive an invitation. Those who violate the above five items will be deemed to have violated the public agreement.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance's Committee for Promoting Bond Sales is Abolished</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Committee for Promoting Bond Sales, originally located in Shanghai, appointed Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and prominent figures in the banking industry as members, with Zhao Zuwang as secretary-general, to promote the various public bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance. Now, the Ministry of Finance, seeing that the credit of various public bonds has improved, has ordered the committee to be abolished. After receiving the order, the committee immediately prepared to close down and was officially abolished on the 11th of this month. All files were transferred to the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office for verifying and canceling bonds. All staff members, except for a portion who were transferred to the bond verification and exchange office, were given severance pay and dismissed.</p>
<h3>Jiang Bocheng Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Visit Chen Jitang in Guangdong Within a Week</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Jiang Bocheng, a member of the Beiping Military Council, returned to Shanghai from Guangdong a few days ago and then rushed to Henan to meet with Chairman Chiang to report on everything. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 25th. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Jiang at his private residence yesterday morning. According to him, his trip to Henan was to meet with Chairman Chiang to report on the progress of his previous trip to Guangdong. Chairman Chiang has now arrived in Beiping and is undergoing a medical examination for stomach problems. He will return to the south after the examination in Beiping. Jiang himself will not stay in Shanghai for long and plans to take a ship to Guangdong within a week to visit Chen Bonan, the commander-in-chief of the Southern Route Anti-Bandit Army.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng Denies Gold Speculation News in Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>Whether There are Other Intentions is Unknown</p>
<p>Du Has Already Sent a Letter Asking for Correction</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that after the government implemented a tax increase on silver exports, the price of gold suddenly rose, and the market was temporarily tense. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, the market price has been stabilizing. However, the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily reported news about the gold speculation market on October 26, which involved Du Yuesheng. A reporter from the New News Agency specially visited Du regarding this matter. According to Du, the government's increase in the silver tax is to prevent the massive outflow of silver. As for gold speculation, it is a common practice in the business world. The news about Du and the gold speculation market published in the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily yesterday is obviously inconsistent with the facts, and the headline is especially alarming. Whether there are other intentions is unknown. He is deeply afraid that the news will be spread by word of mouth, so he has sent a letter to the newspaper asking for correction.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting the Cancellation of the Heavy Tobacco Tax in Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Unified Tax Has Already Been Paid and Should Not Be Reimposed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, stating (excerpt): "On the 25th of this month, the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association informed us that they had received a letter from the Guangzhou Chinese Cigarette Industry Association stating that from the 22nd of this month, a heavy tobacco tax of 20% would be levied on each box of cigarettes based on the selling price, and it would be called 'unified control.' The cigarette merchants expressed their opposition and requested assistance." The Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various related cigarette companies to discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that since cigarettes have already paid the unified tax, they should be allowed to circulate throughout the country, and no local government should reimpose the tax. In the past, some provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi had reimposed the tax, but the Tax Bureau had successively stopped them. Now, Guangdong Province is implementing a heavy tax, which is similar to a disguised likin tax, violating the unified tax regulations, damaging the prestige of the central government, and making it difficult for businesses to bear the burden. Moreover, at a time of economic depression, the cigarette business is declining. If we do not take into account the difficulties and impose a heavy tax, it is tantamount to taking advantage of people in distress and putting them to death. Guangzhou cigarette merchants have not expressed their approval in the past, and our cigarette factories should actively oppose it in the future. If we do not quickly find a way to stop it, the consequences of imitation will be even more worrying. Therefore, it was decided on the spot to actively oppose it. In addition to sending a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, and a letter to the Tax Bureau requesting a prompt stop to the heavy tax, we are also specially writing to your association, asking you to consider the difficulties of businesses, quickly forward the request to the higher authorities, strictly prohibit the heavy tax, and stop it immediately, so as to reduce the burden and comfort the people. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully." According to Article 5 of the Unified Tax Regulations promulgated by the National Government, all goods that have paid the unified tax shall not be subject to any other taxes when they are transported to various provinces. Now, cigarettes have also paid the unified tax and are transported to various places. According to the regulations, they cannot be subject to any other taxes. Based on the previous letter, we should send a telegram on your behalf, requesting that the heavy tobacco tax of 20% be canceled immediately, so as to implement the tax system and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We look forward to your reply. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Provide Relief to Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan</h3>
<p>Those Who Obtained Travel Funds Have Returned to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>Representatives Going to Beijing Stop Petitioning</p>

As for Wang Yanqian, the representative who went to Beijing to petition, he stopped petitioning after being persuaded by friends and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. He also plans to return to his hometown within a few days and seek a new career. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also sent clerk Tan Zhonglu with money to Shanghai yesterday to distribute relief funds of five yuan per person to the seventh batch of overseas Chinese. As for the four overseas Chinese who returned to the country in the eleventh batch, they arrived in the evening yesterday on the Rokko Maru. The overseas Chinese remaining in Shanghai will petition the Party and government agencies again.</p>

<h3>The Tooth Tax in This City Has Not Increased</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it was reported yesterday that various tooth industry businesses in this city had presented a request for the authorities to increase taxes and continue to follow the previous precedents. The reporter inquired with the Municipal Finance Bureau for details as follows: 1. After the tooth tax in the urban area was transferred to the city, all tooth industry goods and other items were handled in accordance with the regulations of Jiangsu Province's revised and reorganized tooth tax regulations. However, the long-term tooth industry certificate, which was previously exchanged every 20 years, has now been changed to every five years. The proportion of registration tax payable has been reduced and is lower than before. The registration and business taxes for short-term tooth industry certificates do not distinguish between prosperous and remote areas, and the tax rate has also been reduced rather than increased. It is a mistake to refer to it as an increased tax. 2. In the past, when collecting tooth industry tax, a handling fee of 10% was levied under the registration tax item, and an education fee of 20% and a county construction special donation of one yuan, a county autonomy fund of 50 cents to two yuan, and a collection fee of four cents were levied under the business tax item. Since the transfer to the city, all of the above-mentioned collections have been abolished, reducing the burden on merchants and citizens. 3. Regarding the restriction on commissions, the National Finance Conference resolved seven items to reorganize the tooth tax. Item 3 of the original method stated that "the commission fees charged by tooth commissions and tooth businesses vary greatly from province to province, ranging from 1% to 5%. At a time when agriculture and commerce are in difficulty, it seems appropriate to restrict them. It is proposed to set the rate at 3%, and each province and city should consider the local transaction situation and determine the restriction." Since the original method stipulated a rate of 3%, this city can only consider limiting it within the scope of 3%. Therefore, Article 18 of the city's Tooth Business Operating Rules stipulates that the tooth business commission fee is 3%, which is also in accordance with the reorganization of the tooth tax methods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. Although some restrictions have been added to the tooth business, if the tooth business can reduce the commission fee, the citizens will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Transport Weapons to Supply the Communist Party</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate and Police Department are Investigating</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, the Japanese Consul General's Police Department recently discovered that a certain Japanese person secretly transported weapons from Japan to supply the Chinese Communist Party in order to take action before the Fifth Plenary Session. It is also heard that a certain Japanese person and acquaintances among the Japanese expatriates in this city are contacting people in mainland Japan to jointly plot, but the matter was discovered by the consulate, so it is now being seriously investigated. However, the content of the case has no ideological background. In order to make a profit, they do not hesitate to enter into a contract with the Communist Party. The truth of the case has not yet been fully investigated, so it is not convenient to publish it.</p>
<h3>The Drought Relief Association Sends a Telegram to Thank the Central Government for Donating Salaries to Help Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Five-Year-Old Saves Small Candy Money for Relief</p>
<p>This year's drought has spread across the country, and there are no less than tens of millions of victims in various provinces crying for food. The central government, witnessing the tragedy, is deeply concerned. At present, it has passed an order instructing government officials in various provinces and cities to donate salaries to help relief efforts in order to save the people. The association sent a telegram to thank the central government yesterday. The original telegram stated: "President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Vice President Kong, and all ministers, Secretary-General of the Nanjing Central Political Council, and all committee members: On the same day, the Executive Yuan approved the regulations proposed by Minister Kong on donating salaries to help relief efforts. The benevolent voice has been broadcast, and all people of the sea are impressed. Millions of victims will be blessed. Shanghai City Relief Association for Drought Victims bows respectfully." In addition, Huang Youhan, a five-year-old child residing at No. 24, Continental Lane, Luban Road in this city, saved one yuan of candy money yesterday and sent it to the association to help relief efforts with a letter. The child's enthusiasm for relief is commendable. The original letter from the child is recorded below: "Dear old gentlemen of the Drought Relief Association, I heard my father say that the drought is very serious, and many families have starved to death, and there are many who have no food to eat and have sold their beloved children. It is really bitter and pitiful. After hearing this news, can I still bear to eat candy? Take the one yuan I saved and please give it to our suffering friends. Huang Youhan"</p>
<h3>Local Commemoration in Maqiao Town</h3>
<p>During the Qi-Lu War in the autumn of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang army gathered in Maqiao Town, which belongs to the southwestern county of this city, and it was the first to bear the brunt. Later, Niu Tiesheng ran around to mediate, but to no avail. Then he requested that the retreating troops move the battle line and focus on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, so Maqiao and Yutang areas were spared from the ravages of war. Local people rejoiced and celebrated every 19th day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, hanging lanterns for three days to celebrate. Yesterday was the first day, and operas and plays were performed in the Town God Temple of the town to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Nanyang Visited the Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory</h3>
<p>The Double Ten brand Liangxinji toothbrush company's products, including the one-bristle non-shedding toothbrush, have long been popular in the Nanyang Islands and are well-received by overseas Chinese. The other day, Hu Dasheng and other five people from the French delegation to the Fifth Plenary Session went to Beijing to attend the meeting, and took the opportunity to visit the factory in Shanghai, guided by Liang Bozhi. They were received by General Manager Chen Bingxia, Factory Director Luo Weijia, and others. All parts of the factory, such as drilling holes, drilling holes, opening bones, grinding boards, and planting hair, were carefully browsed, and Chen Bingxia explained the manufacturing situation in detail. The representatives all agreed that the factory's products were the most beautiful among domestic products. Finally, the factory gave each representative half a dozen new-style toothbrushes, and they left after about two hours.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Manufacturers Hosted a Banquet for the Vietnamese Delegation Last Night</h3>
<p>Hoping to Introduce Domestic Goods to Nanyang</p>
<p>Li Ziying, Hu Dasheng, Zheng Manlin, Lin Zechen, and Guo Henjie, five representatives of the Vietnamese delegation attending the Fifth Plenary Session, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th by ship and prepared to go to Beijing during the day to attend the Fifth Plenary Session. As soon as the representatives arrived in this city, they contacted Liang Bozhi, the secretary-general of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Domestic Goods Manufacturers Association, to reminisce about the past. Liang, admiring the representatives' enthusiasm for the Party and the country in coming from afar, specially joined forces with Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory, Guanshengyuan Food Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Kangyuan Cannery, Forest Rattan Weaving Factory, First Brand Toothbrush Factory, Lianhua Woolen Mill, Mingyi Knitting Factory, and other 20 manufacturers to host a banquet at Guanshengyuan on the third floor at around 7 p.m. on the 26th to welcome the representatives and express their welcome. Chen Shuixia, the general manager of Liangxinji, and Huang Hanliang, the assistant manager of Guanshengyuan, were responsible for the reception. During the banquet, Liang Bozhi stood up and delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the manufacturers, saying that the representatives were enthusiastic about the Party and the country and did not hesitate to come from afar to attend the Fifth Plenary Session. Now that they are passing through this city and intend to take the opportunity to investigate the state of industry, the brothers and others have prepared a small feast to express their welcome. We are honored that you have taken the time to attend. At present, domestic goods manufacturers in the country are working hard to improve the quality of their products, and there has been significant progress in practice. However, overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang may not know this phenomenon. We hope that the representatives will do their best to promote and introduce a large number of domestic goods to Nanyang after returning to Nanyang in the future to regain the commercial status of the motherland in Nanyang. This is not only the fortune of domestic goods." Then, Lin Zechen stood up and replied, saying that he was unworthy of the banquet hosted by the manufacturers. As for promoting and introducing domestic goods, it is our duty. Our old friend Liang is also an old overseas Chinese of more than ten years and is very familiar with the situation in various parts of the Nanyang Islands. Tonight, I was introduced by him to meet you and learn that domestic goods have made great progress. If the brothers and others return to Nanyang in the future, we will do our best to promote and introduce them." It was not until around 9 p.m. that the guests and hosts parted happily. It is heard that the representatives plan to visit various factories in Shanghai during the day accompanied by Liang and publish the details they learned in various newspapers in Nanyang.</p>
<h3>Ziyang Temple and Others on Simalu Road Sued for Rent Arrears Have Filed a Counterclaim</h3>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports that Ziyang Temple, Beixin Bookstore, and Xinshi Record Player Company on Fuzhou Road in this city have proposed a 25% rent reduction to the owner, Tonghe Company, in order to survive and prosper together due to the declining market and the difficulty of maintaining their businesses. The company initially ignored it. Later, Ziyang Temple and others sent a letter urging them to inquire, and Jiang Yiping, a lawyer representing the company, replied, stating that due to the high cost of water and land rentals, it was not convenient to reduce the rent. Ziyang Temple, Beixin Bookstore, Xinshi Record Player Company, and others felt that the company had no sincerity in cooperation. Moreover, rent reduction is a unanimous demand of the public in this city. Therefore, they deposited the monthly rent in the bank at a 25% discount and sent the passbook to Tonghe Company, but the company refused to accept it and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court for rent arrears, requesting the recovery of the house. Now, Ziyang Temple, Beixin Bookstore, Xinshi Record Player Company, and others have filed a counterclaim, and Minleyuan Restaurant has also joined the group. The reason is that the land in that area, according to the current rent, is equivalent to a weekly interest rate of 1.2% including land tax, water fee, and construction cost. If the rent is paid at a 25% discount, there is still a weekly interest rate of 0.8%. Compared to the rate of return for real estate, it is still abundant, because most real estate developers only have a weekly interest rate of 0.3% to 0.4%. They request that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected.</p>
<h3>Dai Gengxin Returns After Inspecting the Cigarette Industry in Europe and America</h3>

He left the United States at the beginning of this month and returned to the country by ship, arriving in port the other day. Dai has gained a lot of experience from this inspection and will make contributions to the company and the domestic cigarette industry.</p>
<h3>Chinese Grocery Stores Implement a Surcharge for Wooden Boxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association issued a circular No. 7 yesterday regarding the surcharge for wooden boxes, stating that the purpose of the circular is to investigate the case. The industry has been selling Chinese and foreign groceries since the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty and has always held a low-profit principle. That is, if the goods sold by the industry need to be packed in wooden boxes, the value of the wooden boxes has not been directly calculated to the purchasers. Recently, the number of goods packed in boxes has been increasing, and the association has repeatedly requested its members to find a way to remedy this. Therefore, it was decided at the 16th meeting of the first executive committee that for those in the same industry who sell goods in wooden boxes, the purchasers should be charged 1% of the value of the goods as a wooden box fee to maintain business operations. The association has issued Circular No. 4 to all companies in the same industry to follow the instructions. It has now been found that most of the companies have followed the resolution and implemented it. However, it is feared that some aspects are not fully understood and that there may be excuses. This matter is closely related to the interests of the same industry. Therefore, a special circular is issued, hoping that all companies will check the previous letter and implement the surcharge for wooden box fees consistently when selling goods in wooden boxes in order to benefit business operations. This is extremely important. Chairman Cheng Yujie, Standing Committee Members Feng Liansheng and Ba Lingyun.</p>
<h3>After the Copper Coin Murder, the Culprit's Accomplices Still Dare to Extort</h3>
<p>The Deceased's Family Asks the Police for Protection</p>
<p>Two People Arrested at the Old Eastern Hotel Yesterday</p>
<p>Gao Anjun, a Shandong native who previously served as Chinese Constable No. 78 in the French Concession police force, age 42, was transferred to the Transportation Department. His eyesight was deemed insufficient. Gao Hu, a 40-year-old woman from Anhui, lived with him on the upper floor of a garage at 183 Rue Lafitte in the French Concession. Around the 10th of last month, someone went to Cheng Pengjiu's Chengshuntai Cigarette Paper Store at 132 Rue Remy in the French Concession to exchange a two-cent silver coin. The store gave him 47 copper coins. Since the market price should have been 480 cash, the person argued with the store clerk, Chen Alin, about the missing copper coin, leading to a quarrel. Gao Anjun happened to pass by and, recognizing the store,</p>
<p>helped the store owner, pressuring the coin exchanger, eventually leading to a fight. People intervened to break it up, and the man left with resentment. A week later, at 12:30 PM on September 17th, the person who had been wronged gathered over a dozen fellow gangsters and went to Rue Remy to seek revenge on Gao. Gao happened to be walking there,</p>
<p>Although he was carrying a self-defense pistol, it was a case of enemies meeting on a narrow road, and their eyes were especially red. They rushed to grab and beat Gao. Gao couldn't even draw his gun to resist and was shot twice, falling to the ground. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled in a panic. Later, the police learned of the incident and sent Gao to the hospital, but he died within three hours without receiving medical treatment. The police reported to the Special</p>
<p>Court, which sent officials to examine the body. The family collected the body for burial, and the police ordered the arrest of the criminals, as reported in previous newspapers. However, the culprits fled to Hankou to avoid trouble after the incident. Recently they returned to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the culprit's accomplices, fearless of the law, dared to go to the deceased's home a few days ago, threatening the widow, Mrs. Gao Hu, to extort 1,000 yuan to settle the matter, or they would kill her entire family to vent their anger, and so on. The woman was greatly frightened upon hearing this and dared not stay safely at home. She reported it to the French Concession police, asking for protection. At 6 PM the day before yesterday, Jin Jiulin, the chief of the special agency, discovered that accomplices of the murderer were hiding in Room 9 of the Old Eastern Hotel on Sanma Road. He immediately led detectives Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, and Bao detective Xu Qintang, along with detectives dispatched from the Old Zha Police Station, to the Eastern Hotel and arrested Shao Lian'gen (30 years old, from Ningbo) and Wang Daode (35 years old, from Anhui), bringing them back to the French Concession police station.</p>
<p>During questioning, Shao confessed that he was the "old man" and that the incident originated from his disciple Wang Azhong exchanging cash. Wang was wronged and told him. Later, he gathered with Mao Jusheng and others who are on the run to seek revenge. Wang and Mao fired the shots, and so on. Yesterday, the police sent the two defendants to the Third Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Cao Jun presided over the trial. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and requested a postponement to arrest the accomplices who are on the run and to investigate the case in detail before prosecuting. The defendants hired lawyers to defend them. The court verified the report, questioned the defendants, and then approved a rescheduling of the hearing for November 5th. The two</p>
<p>defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on Route Ghisi</h3>
<p>The Xinkangtai Cigarette Paper Store at 259 Route Ghisi in the French Concession is owned by Zhang Chongxin from Tianjin. The business was doing quite well. Around 7:30 PM last night, four robbers suddenly arrived, two dressed in long robes and two in short clothes, speaking with local accents. They burst into the store under the pretext of exchanging cash, brandishing pistols to threaten and intimidate the owner. As a result, they robbed a total of over 100 yuan in silver dollars and small silver coins. As the robbers were about to leave, the owner, Zhang Chongxin's younger brother, named Chongxiu, followed them in pursuit. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers guarding the rear noticed and turned back, firing four shots. One bullet hit Zhang's head, and he fainted to the ground. By the time the nearby police on duty heard the alarm and rushed over, the robbers had vanished without a trace. The injured man was immediately taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. His life is said to be in critical condition.</p>

<h3>Jiu Ji Timber Merchant's Young Owner Zhang Shouchun is Publicly Prosecuted by the Police</h3>
<p>Charged with Restricting Freedom and Assault</p>
<p>Love Dispute with Guangdong Woman Deng Liming</p>
<p>—Some Say Deng Liming is the Daughter of the Conklin Pen Company—</p>
<p>Deng Liming, a 23-year-old woman from Guangdong, residing at No. 55 Jingxiu Road, Ximennei, Nanshi, received a considerable education and possesses exceptional beauty. Last year, she became involved with Zhang Shouchun from Pudong, the young owner of the Jiuji Timber Company on Jichang Road, Nanshi. Zhang and Deng, both young and romantic, became deeply in love after their involvement, mutually promising marriage. Unexpectedly, after a few spring encounters, Deng became pregnant. Now five months pregnant, Deng, ashamed to show her face, pressed Zhang to fulfill his promise and choose an auspicious date for marriage. However, Zhang completely broke his previous promise and instead told Deng to abort the fetus, which Deng refused. From then on, their relationship broke down, and Zhang stopped contacting Deng, discarding her like worn shoes. The woman entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to send a letter to Zhang, urging him to give a satisfactory reply, or she would resort to legal action. However, Zhang ignored it completely. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose. On the 20th of last month, Deng Liming, along with Pan Xingfen, the wife of Pan Zhaoru, who resides at No. 6, Lane 563, Weihaiwei Road, went to the Great Shanghai Cinema on Xizang Road to watch a movie. At 11:30 PM, after the movie ended, they searched everywhere for Pan's car, No. 4400, without success. So they hired a rickshaw to go home. As the rickshaw passed the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch, Pan's car, No. 4400, driven by rickshaw puller Zhang Zixi, caught up from behind. Deng and Pan got out of the rickshaw and transferred to the car. Unexpectedly, at this moment, Zhang Shouchun suddenly chased after them in a yellow car, No. 12048. Seeing Deng getting into the car, Zhang jumped out of his car, rushed to Deng, and started scolding her, calling Deng "rotten goods" and "shameless". Deng argued with him. Zhang then took out a pistol to threaten her and slapped Deng on the face twice. Seeing Zhang getting violent, Deng avoided him and got into the car, saying that they would talk tomorrow. Zhang replied that she could sue him. They then dispersed. After suffering this assault, Deng was shocked and her pregnancy was disturbed. The next day, she consulted a doctor, who advised her to rest for two weeks. Deng followed the doctor's advice.</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, having recovered her health, she went to the Chengdu Road Police Station to report the incident. Chinese detective Ji Binkui and Western detective Harvey began investigating. They soon found out that the yellow car No. 12048 was rented by Zhang from the Huang Car Rental Station on Xizang Road and Avenue Petain. When he rented the car, he was in a hurry and forced the driver Zhu Zhaoqi to drive without waiting for him to sign the papers. Zhu refused. Zhang then showed the municipal government badge, saying that he would be responsible for anything. Zhu then drove the car out and, at the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, Zhang instructed the driver to pay attention to car No. 4400. If they saw the car, they should follow it. They then encountered it at the intersection of Avenue Foch. Zhang then got out of the car and slapped a woman on the face, and so on. Zhang Zixi also testified to the same facts. A public prosecution was then initiated, and the First Special Court was requested to issue a summons, entrusting the Shanghai Local Court to assist in delivering it. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. Zhang Shouchun did not appear. Lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun appeared in court, saying that the defendant was currently in Hong Kong and therefore could not appear in court. They requested a postponement of the trial for two weeks so that he could appear in court to respond to the charges. Then, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the above situation and, based on Article 319 of the Criminal Law regarding restricting freedom and Article 293 of the same law regarding assault, requested a judgment according to the law. Judge Huang stated that the defendant was not present and therefore could not proceed. He ordered a rescheduling of the hearing for two weeks later. If the defendant still did not appear at that time, a warrant would be issued for his arrest. The court then adjourned. It is rumored that Deng Liming was a saleswoman of Conklin pens in the stationery department of the former Wing On Company. Zhang and Deng's relationship started with the purchase of a pen. Whether this is true is unconfirmed because both parties have kept it a secret. It will likely be clarified at the next court hearing.</p>
<h3>The Major Robbery Case at Xue Mai Luo's Office Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 29th</p>
<p>The case of the robbery of 12,000 yuan in cash and banknotes from Xue Mai Luo's accounting firm on the afternoon of June 9th of this year, involving Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qing</p>
<p>Yue, and other four people, because the French Police Department disagreed with the Second Special Court's judgment declaring Zhang and the other four innocent, filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, has been reported extensively in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the High Court's Third Branch to continue the joint trial. The appellants Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qingyue, and the four people, each accompanied by their defense lawyers Lin Yingqing, E Sen, Li Guozhen, Yan Yinwu, and eleven other lawyers, arrived at the court to wait for the trial at 2:00 PM. The French Police Department was still represented in court by lawyer Gu Shouxi. The plaintiff, Zhou Jinggeng, the victim, also arrived with his representative lawyer Zhang Shanle to await instructions because he filed an appeal for an associated civil private lawsuit. At three o'clock, judges Sun Honglin, Zhang Chaozuo, and Fan Peien, along with clerk Huang Lixiang, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, specifically opened the First Criminal Court for the trial. They called the four appellants and the plaintiff to the case. First, Zhang Zuming was asked, "What do you have to say now regarding the words provided by each witness who appeared in court last time?" Zhang replied, "I am a law-abiding businessman. I would never dare to be a robber." Asked, "They identified you as being there to rob." He replied, "I'm afraid they mistook me." Then Zhuang Jimeng was asked, "What do you have to say about the witnesses' words?" Zhuang replied, "They saw me at the Hongkou Police Station first, so they came to the French Police Station to identify me." Wang Lianyou was then asked, "Gao Yushu and Feng Timan saw me first, so they later falsely identified me as a thief." Also, the person who operated the elevator last time recognized me as pulling him in and also determined that I had a silver tongue. I am afraid that they also mistook me." Finally, Tang Qingyue was asked, "I have nothing to say." Then the plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng was asked, "What do you have to say about the witnesses' words?" Zhou replied, "The witnesses' words are completely truthful and without error. They all saw clearly at the scene during the robbery." The judge then declared, "This court has sent a written request to the Bank of China for investigation regarding the withdrawal of 38,000 yuan in banknotes on June 9th. Now, according to the reply, it is confirmed that the withdrawal was indeed made, and the banknotes had the characters 'Jing' and 'Bao' and hidden mark stamps." At this point, the defense lawyer for Zhang Zuming presented a racetrack result chart, proving that Zhang Zuming was at the racetrack on June 9th. The judge examined the chart and then ordered the debate to begin. Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei then took a large diagram drawn during the investigation at Xue Mai Luo's office some time ago and ordered the police to hang it on the wall behind the seat and then voiced his opinion for an hour. The gist of his opinion was that Zhang Zuming's confession at the police station did not quite match the facts of the case and the appeal should be rejected, and so on. Then, the police department's lawyer and the appellants' lawyers debated in succession. Finally, the three lawyers on the plaintiff's side debated regarding the appeal for the associated civil private lawsuit. The court declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month. The court adjourned after the announcement. The clock had already struck seven.</p>
<h3>Czech Hermit Leaves Behind 80,000 Photos of Women</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports from Prague, Czechoslovakia, on the 25th. It was reported here that more than 80,000 photos of women were discovered in the belongings of an old hermit who recently passed away at the age of 70. Some of these photos were clipped from newspapers and some were formal photos. Each photo came with a short biography of the women in the photo and the date of collection. In the past forty years, there was no shortage of famous women's portraits. The hermit also claimed to be the greatest unchanging lover.</p>
<h3>Seeing Marriage as Child's Play</h3>
<p>Seeking to Divorce Before One Year of Marriage</p>
<p>After Being Sued, Willing to Live Together Again</p>
<p>—Huang Lili Sues Shao Bao San—</p>
<p>Shao Bao San, a clerk at the Shanghai Bankers' Association, also runs the Baoji Confectionery Company on Boone Road in Hongkou in addition to his current position. Therefore, his monthly income includes both the salary of 170 yuan from the Bankers' Association and the profits from the business, making his life quite comfortable. Last year, on December 14th, he married Huang Lili, a girl who was only seventeen years old. During the honeymoon period, he treated her quite well. However, after a few months, he began to feel disgust for her. Not only did he show no pity or compassion, but he also took advantage of Huang's youth and vulnerability, often treating her cruelly. Recently, he stopped providing for her altogether. Suddenly, on the 12th of last month, he wrote a divorce agreement in advance and gathered many people to coerce her to sign it. When Huang asked for living expenses, Shao seized the opportunity to flare up, slapping her face repeatedly, declaring that if she wanted money, she should quickly sign the agreement, or else not blame him for being ruthless. Huang had never attended school and did not understand the purpose of the agreement. However, she did not suspect it was a divorce agreement and thought it was a simple task that would get her money for living expenses. So she held the pen and signed as instructed. Shao then tore the agreement in half, throwing half of it and 40 silver dollars to Huang, and issued an order to leave, not allowing her to stay. The woman was completely bewildered and did not know what to do. She had to endure the pain of leaving home. She then took the agreement she held and asked someone to read it, and only then did she learn that the wording on the agreement was for an amicable divorce. The woman then temporarily returned to her mother's home at No. 1048 East Boone Road to stay. On the one hand, because Shao had abused her before and defrauded her later, she retained lawyer Gu Yushang to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, requesting that Shao be summoned to the court for mediation, stating that Shao's various actions were purely due to his deceit of her youth and vulnerability, and that he dared to abuse and abandon her. Not only was he not satisfied with destroying her, but he also committed this insane act. However, since the agreement did not have the legal formalities, it was naturally invalid, and his coercion to sign it was a violation of the criminal law. Since being driven out, she was even more unable to support herself. Therefore, she requested that Shao Bao San be ordered to give her 50 yuan per month for living expenses for 30 years, totaling 18,000 yuan, to support her survival. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao Dejun of the Mediation Court opened the court for mediation. Huang Lili, accompanied by her representative lawyer Gu Yushang, appeared in court and explained the details of the incident, and presented the agreement as evidence. Shao Bao San did not appear in court, only entrusting a lawyer to appear, claiming that although the divorce agreement was established at that time, Shao now also believes that it is illegal and therefore not valid. The half of the agreement held by Shao has already been burned. He is still willing to be husband and wife with Huang, and his request to provide separate living expenses is difficult to bear. Judge Tao, because the opposing party indicated that it could not pay living expenses, declared the mediation unsuccessful. Huang then retained lawyer Gu to handle the legal procedures for formally suing Shao Bao San. Having been married for only a year, they are breaking up. This is truly the misfortune of modern marriage.</p>
<h3>Wang Boqun's Mother, Madam Liu, Posthumous Honors</h3>

<p>Mr. Ma Has Already Traveled South to Preside</p>
<p>In addition to purchasing goods from around the world, Sincere Company is also enthusiastic about promoting domestic products. The annual sales volume of its Hong Kong and Guangdong branches is astounding. Last winter, given the urgent national crisis, promoting domestic goods was imperative. It joined with major factories in Hong Kong and Guangdong to organize a domestic product exhibition in Hong Kong, which was warmly supported by the public and praised by public opinion, setting a new record never seen before in Hong Kong. (Note: This was the first time a domestic product exhibition was held in Hong Kong.) It is heard that the second exhibition has been scheduled to be held from the 31st of this month and to expand the organizational scope and make doubled efforts to promote domestic products. On the Shanghai side, there are now dozens of companies invited to participate, and famous domestic product manufacturers in Hong Kong and Guangdong are eagerly joining, with excellent and dazzling products. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. This is truly good news amid the call to save the country through domestic goods. It is also learned that Mr. Ma Yingbiao, the general supervisor of the company,</p>

<p>Trial of the China Industrial Bank's Public Prosecution Case</p>
<h3>Creditors Flock to the Hearing</h3>
<p>No Space Left in the Courtroom, Those Arriving Later Stand Outside</p>
<p>Lu Xihou's Use of Depositors' Funds is Extremely Improper</p>
<p>The Bank's Downfall Was Affected by the International Race Club</p>
<p>The Secrets of Artificial Silk Trading are Exposed, Revealing the Truth</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank went bankrupt, and the manager, Qin Baoyuan, fled in advance. The managing director, Lu Xihou, was arrested after the police investigated him for embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust, and the First Special District Court filed a public prosecution against him in accordance with Articles 363 and 366 of the Criminal Law. Lu has been detained and interrogated at the First Special Court. It is believed that if the bank's creditors frequently filed complaints with the court, it would be uneconomical in terms of the handling procedures and time. It has been decided that if the creditors want to file lawsuits, they should report to the chief police station handling the case, so that the</p>
<p>police can also file a public prosecution and try the case together, which would be more convenient. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the public prosecution case to be heard. The bank's creditors who went to the First Criminal Court on the third floor of the First Special Court to listen to the hearing</p>
<h3>flocked in</h3>
<p>By 2 PM, there were no vacant seats in the courtroom's gallery. Those who arrived later had to stand outside, which was quite crowded. Shortly after, Chief Judge Qian Hongye took his seat and ordered that the two defendants, Lu Xihou and Sun Xiren, be brought to the table. The police prosecution lawyer Ru Bao Yi and the two defendants' defense lawyers Wu Linkun and Fan Gang, and five others also attended at the same time. First, Lawyer Ru stated the details of the continued investigation after the trial opened on Monday of this week, as well as the reasons for the additional charges against Lu Xihou. He briefly stated that during the adjournment of the case, the police also learned that the facts handled by the defendant Lu Xihou at the China Industrial Bank this year were mostly out of line, resulting in many people in the community being deceived into making deposits. Recently, people who were deceived in this way have reported to the police, who are collecting</p>
<h3>conclusive evidence</h3>
<p>However, the exact amount must be investigated by an accountant before the exact number can be known. Lu Xihou is the person in charge of the bank. The bank's business situation and organizational procedures are clearly contrary to the provisions of Articles 46, 47, and 48 of the Banking Law. The bank established a savings department this year, but it did not pre-register with the Ministry of Finance and apply for a savings business license, which also violates the provisions of Article 16 of the Savings Bank Management Law. Therefore, today he specifically filed an additional complaint against Lu based on the above two sets of regulations. As for the witnesses, several have been summoned today and can prove that the bank's internal affairs were extremely corrupt and that the funds absorbed were used for improper purposes. In addition, the police also found out that some people in the bank were only in charge of empty titles and received 100 yuan in travel expenses each month.</p>
<h3>They didn't ask about the activities</h3>
<p>and didn't know the internal affairs of the company. However, after questioning today, a postponement is still requested, because the police still need to continue investigating. The court then summoned witness Shao Fengshan, who testified that he was in charge of buying artificial silk at Dashengchang Foreign Grocery Company. The company is an affiliate of Xinhua Trading Company and he is specifically assigned as the manager. All actions must be directed by Sun Xiren, the manager of Xinhua Trading Company. Dashengchang was founded on August 29 of this year. I used to work at Xinhua, and was later transferred to Dashengchang. Each time Dashengchang purchased artificial silk, it was all handed over to Xinhua for sale. The payment paid at the time of purchase was the check for Dashengchang, which was exchanged for a bank draft at the China Industrial Bank. The procedures for exchanging the draft were handled by Sun Xiren and the bank, and I was not able to know.</p>
<h3>What were the proceeds used for</h3>
<p>was also not known to me. The artificial silk of Mitsui this time was also bought by me. After Dashengchang closed down, the account books used were handed over to Sun Xiren for safekeeping on September 26. Xinhua Company was opened by Qin Baoyuan, Sun Xiren, and a Mr. Yao. I once questioned Qin because he sold the purchased silk at a low price. According to Qin, the International Race Club, which was run by Lu Xihou, needed a lot of money, which was all paid by the bank, which made the bank feel empty and unable to turn around, so this strategy was set up to obtain cash to help. Then, witness Li Xingkai testified that he was in charge of buying silk at Dashengchang. Shao Fengshan was the manager of the company. According to Shao, the owner of the company was Qin Baoyuan. I used to work at Xinhua Trading Company. The company's purchase and sale of artificial silk was handled by a Mr. Qiu. The goods were all stored in</p>
<h3>Qin Baoyuan's Family</h3>
<p>In China, sold on consignment by the Xinhua Trading Company. Dashengchang closed down on September 25th. Only that day was it discovered that Qin Baoyuan had fled, and Shao Fengshan also suddenly did not return to the store. Moreover, three people, Lu, Zhou, and Qin, came to the store to inquire about the goods and accounts. I then reported this situation to Sun Xiren, and so on. When questioned, the defendant Lu Xihou stated, "I am a director of the Qunyi Syndicate. The Qunyi Syndicate was formed by me, Gao Enhong, Yin Zesheng, and others. We took over from Sun Danlin in the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932]. The syndicate invested 150,000 yuan. I contributed half, and Gao and Yin contributed the other half. Yin was appointed as general manager. Later, because Yin misappropriated a large sum of over 50,000 yuan, I took over sole management around June or July last year, adding 150,000 yuan in capital to continue operating." The court then questioned whether a board of directors had been formed, who the directors were, and how many directors there were.</p>
<h3>Surname, First Name</h3>
<p>Lu's answers to this point were particularly vague. The International Race Club was established in May of this year [1934], with a capital of 500,000 yuan. I subscribed for half, which is 250,000 yuan, and most of it has been paid. The other half of the shares are subscribed by Westerners. The court ordered him to disclose the names of the subscribers. Lu only wrote down one person's name and continued to say that the club was registered in the United States and that the account books were all in Western hands. He initially did not know that Dashengchang was opened by Qin. He was also completely unaware of matters such as the purchase of rayon and the payment of Xingye Bank drafts. Only after Qin fled did he send Zhou Shaopeng and others to Dashengchang to investigate, etc. Furthermore, according to the testimony of the defendant Sun Xiren, the Xinhua Trading Company was established in early April of this year. The shareholders were Qin Baoyuan and someone Yao. The capital was 6,000 yuan, originally intended to</p>
<h3>Frenchman</h3>
<p>cooperate. However, when the company was established, the legal person had not yet arrived in Shanghai, so they initially only did some gauze trading. Shao Fengshan was recommended to the company by Qin Baoyuan, while someone Qiu was introduced by me. The company started trading rayon around May or June and stopped the business soon after because it was unprofitable. In August, Qin Baoyuan resumed operations, saying that the China Xingye Bank was in a state of emptiness, extremely dangerous. As manager, he should find ways to maintain it. Purchasing rayon could be paid for with ten-day drafts, which could be purchased in large quantities. On one hand, they could be sold quickly to generate cash for turnover. If they could maintain it until the opening of the race club, the economy within the bank would surely have a solution, and so on. Qin had the painstaking effort to maintain the bank, and I was an employee, so I should provide assistance to the best of my ability. So, I started</p>
<h3>Buying Rayon</h3>
<p>Buying and selling at the same time, the faster the better, so initially the inflows and outflows were very rapid, and the account books were not even recorded. Later, I felt that if this continued, it would be impossible to investigate, and at this time the Frenchmen cooperating with the company had arrived, which could be inconvenient. Furthermore, the person named Qiu who handled the transactions was unwilling to be solely responsible for the buying and selling. I then consulted with Qin and decided to establish a separate Dashengchang company to be solely responsible for the purchase of goods, while Xinhua was responsible for sales, with a division of labor and cooperation. As for the selling price of the silk, it was entirely paid by Qin to the bank, and occasionally to Yuan Ji (i.e., Qin Baoyuan) or Dashengchang. The Xinhua Company had accounts that could be checked. Who knew that on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Qin talked to me in a certain hotel, saying that he had originally intended to maintain the bank until the Mid-Autumn Festival, but unexpectedly there was still no solution, and the bank authorities wanted to</p>
<h3>Inspect the Accounts</h3>
<p>So, it was still not resolved. I then asked if Lu Xihou knew about the purchase of rayon. Qin said that Lu certainly knew, otherwise how could he issue the drafts? However, Shao Fengshan now claims that the Dashengchang account books have been handed over to me for safekeeping, which is not true. I had no position in Dashengchang. But when Qin Baoyuan fled and Dashengchang closed down, I instructed Li Xingkai to relay to the Dashengchang accountant, surnamed Xie, to</p>
<h3>Keep All the Accounts</h3>
<p>safely. Xie has reportedly returned to his hometown of Zhujiage. I have already sent a letter from the detention center to Xie's relatives, surnamed Lu, instructing them to notify Xie to come to Shanghai for questioning. I believe Xie will come in person, and this point will be clarified, and so on. Next, Lu's defense lawyer spoke, attacking Shao Fengshan greatly, pointing out that Dashengchang was a sham set up by Shao and Qin Baoyuan to steal the China Xingye Bank's drafts and fraudulently purchase goods, shifting the blame onto others. The main culprit is still at large. He also requested that Lu be allowed to post bail. Judge Qian said that before the amount owed to the bank had been verified, the defendant's request should be rejected and ordered that he remain in custody for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Silk Industry Bank Holds a Symposium on the Silver Problem with Economic Experts</h3>
<p>Jin Guobao, Zhang Naiqi, and others all expressed great opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank held a symposium on the silver problem at the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association Club yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Various economic experts participated. General Manager Wang Yansong gave a welcome speech. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Participants: The participants included economic experts, silver and money industry leaders, and industrial and commercial leaders: Xu Xinliu, Zhang Naiqi, Yang Yinpu, Qin Runqing, Xu Jiyi, Xu Yongzuo, Lin Kanghou, Jin Guobao, Pan Yangyao, Zhang Xiaomei, Liu Dajun, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Wenqi, Xu Tongkun, Zhu Yichennong, Qu Jigang, Wang Boyuan, Pei Xueqing, Tang Baoquan, Ta Quanshi, Li Wenjie, Qin Shoubai, Chen Qilu, Yu Yucheng, and others. They were personally received by General Manager Wang Yansong, Deputy General Manager Luo Qinghua, and the editor of the Silk Industry Monthly, Lu Fengshi.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Wang Yansong gave a welcome speech, saying, (excerpt above) Since Britain and the United States successively abandoned the gold standard, and the London Conference failed last year, after the United States continued to buy gold and depreciate its currency, the conflict between the monetary policies of various countries became even more blatant. On June 18th this year, US President Roosevelt signed the Silver Purchase Act passed by Congress, requiring the government to buy silver so that silver would account for one-fourth of the currency reserves. Since then, the market price of silver has been rising daily. Our country, as a silver-using country, had no choice but to be the first to be affected. In addition, the market price of silver is being artificially raised, so within the same period, the rise in foreign countries is higher than in China. As a result, speculators can safely sell short in overseas markets and reap profits. Silver in our country has been flowing out steadily. From January to the present, it is about 188 million yuan. In the middle of this month, the Central Bank began to levy silver export tax and equalization tax, intending to curb the outflow of silver. It is not easy to predict what the results will be in the future. However, since the silver tax was levied, there have been various opinions in the world, and there is no consensus. The consultation department of our bank has received letters asking about the silver problem almost every day. From this point of view, on the one hand, we can see that society has a deep attention and concern for the silver problem. On the other hand, we can also see the upward intellectual desire of modern youth. The purpose of setting up the consultation department of our bank is to serve the society, instill national economic knowledge, so that everyone has economic common sense. Then, when every economic problem occurs, there will be no panic and blind following, like a blind man riding a blind horse. However, the establishment of the consultation department of our bank has only been more than two months, and there are no achievements yet. On the one hand, we answer other people's inquiries, and on the other hand, we especially need the guidance of experts. In other words, the consultation department of our bank is assisting people with knowledge on the one hand, and it still needs to be informed by various experts on the other hand. Today, we invite all the experts to ask you for knowledge on the silver problem, and then contribute the knowledge to the society. We hope that you will give us advice. As for the impact of the silver tax on our country's monetary system, the impact on our country's trade and prices, and whether the Ministry of Finance's plan to exchange silver for gold with the United States is possible, and whether it is necessary for our country to implement the gold standard, please express your opinions at will. In the future, we plan to collect the opinions of various experts and publish them in the Silk Industry Monthly. It would be even more welcome if the experts can give us long and systematic articles to be published in the Silk Industry Monthly published by the consultation department of our bank.</p>
<p>Expert Speeches: After the chairman's welcome speech, economic experts Jin Guobao, Zhang Naiqi, Liu Dajun, Yu Yucheng, and others successively gave speeches on the silver problem, such as the policies of various countries, our country's implementation of additional export taxes, and the establishment of a foreign exchange stabilization committee, and so on. Each expressed great opinions. The word length is not recorded. (The papers of the various experts will appear in the third issue of the Silk Industry Monthly, published on November 15th.) It ended at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Retrial Record of Cai Wenyi's Bribery Case</h3>
<p>Final debate, sentencing on the 31st</p>
<p>Cai Wenyi, a former technical assistant of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, was previously accused by the women Chen Chengshi and Chen Sunshi, aunt and daughter-in-law, of soliciting a bribe of one thousand yuan for building a house. The Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>clearly sentenced him to eight months in prison. Cai refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the original trial court. As a result, the appeal was rejected and the original sentence was upheld. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that Cai still refused to accept it and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which has ordered a retrial. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the head of the Criminal Court, Liu Enrong, along with two judges, Sun Jikang and Shao Qinzhi, and Prosecutor Xie Lian, specially opened the third court for trial. (Cai Wenyi is in custody and has been sent to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment due to illness, and is still not cured.) He was ordered to bring Cai back from the hall. According to Cai's testimony, he is 28 years old, from Chuansha, and was previously a technical assistant in the Bureau of Public Works. Judge Liu (4) Why do you refuse to accept it? The High Court has now ordered a retrial. You should state the reasons for your refusal. Cai (answer) I have not committed any crime. As for the drawings for Chen Chengshi's house, I did not draw them. (Question) Because Chen Chengshi's family wanted to build an overpass building, they bribed one thousand yuan. (Answer) That is not the case. The witness Wang Dasheng testified, age 34, from Pudong, a painter. (Question) Why hasn't Hong Atao arrived? (Answer) Hong Atao is now working in Ningbo. I am his student and represent him in court today. The court ordered Qu Bingyu to testify, age 47, from Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, in the construction business. (Question) Did you contract to build Chen Chengshi's house? (Answer) Yes, I subcontracted it to Hong Atao. A total of five houses were built, costing 14,400 yuan. The contract between Hong and Chen Chengshi was for 14,600 yuan. Hong earned 200 yuan. The owner wanted to build an overpass building. I said it couldn't be built because the Bureau of Public Works would interfere. (Question) Did you go to Hong Atao at that time to think of a way and you went to call Cai Wenyi to draw the drawing? (Answer) No, this drawing was drawn by Xu Deming. Because civil servants cannot draw drawings for others. (Question) Is it two thousand yuan in lobbying fees? (Answer) No. The court ordered Xu Deming to testify, age 33, from Shanghai, living at 10 Zhangjia Lane in the south of the city, working as a model maker. (Question) Did you draw the drawings for Chen Chengshi's house? (Answer) No, after their model was drawn, they brought it to me and asked me to stamp it because the Bureau of Public Works cannot draw drawings for others. I have registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. At this point, the court ordered Cai Wenyi and Qu Bingyu to confront each other in court. Xu Deming claimed that Cai Wenyi and Qu Bingyu came together and begged me to affix the seal. Judge Liu then said to Cai Wenyi, "In this way, it can be seen that you drew it." Cai (answer) Xu Deming is considering his own interests. He often goes to the Bureau of Public Works to apply for licenses and is very well connected within the bureau. Finally, Chen Sunshi testified, age 23, from Shanghai, living at 58 Jinjiafang. Previously, five houses were counted. Because the stone warehouse door and patio were reduced, only 13,200 yuan was paid for the construction, as full payment. At the time of construction, Hong Atao said to me, "There is a way to think of it within the Bureau of Public Works." He ordered me to pay 2,000 yuan in lobbying fees. First, I took 1,000 yuan and gave it to Hong Atao, who turned it over to Cai Wenyi, which was drawn from the construction cost. I once went to Cai Wenyi's house with Hong Atao. According to Cai, there is someone in the bureau who is making things difficult, but don't be impatient and think of a way slowly. The official said to Cai Wenyi, "Has Chen Sunshi been to your house?" Cai (answer) She has not been here. Judge Liu then asked Prosecutor Xie for his opinion. Mr. Xie said that Cai Wenyi's appeal had no basis and should be rejected. Then lawyers Yao Fuyuan and Wang Peiyuan successively defended Cai, requesting that he be declared not guilty. Judge Liu said that the case was clear and ordered the end of the debate, setting the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 31st of this month. Cai Wenyi was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>A Female Bandit in the Chen Baoming Kidnapping Case Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Chen Fengxiang, deceased trustee of Nantou, Pudong, age 36, son Chen Baoming, was kidnapped by bandits Li Apei and others on the evening of July 10th this year around 10:00 PM.

Chen Baoming took advantage of the opportunity to escape the next day and reported to the police, who rushed to arrest him. Only Hu's wife, Hu Yaoshi, was arrested and sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court for interrogation and prosecution. The criminal court's debate has ended, and the sentence is awaited. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that Sun Jikang, a judge, opened the court yesterday and ordered Hu Yaoshi to be brought before the court. After a brief questioning, the sentence was announced in court.

Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, the military band was invited by a Qian family nearby. Yang followed the team to serve. Not long after, the sedan chair set off to welcome the bride from the Kun family in Chijiabang. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and a stray bullet hit Yang's left waist, and blood flowed straight. He fell to the ground, unable to support himself. After the accident, the injured person was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment in a police car by the local public security bureau, while investigating the source of the stray bullet in order to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai New Taijiquan Association</h3>
<p>Mr. Dong Yingjie, who received the true teachings of the national Taijiquan master Yang Chengfu, was persuaded by friends in Shanghai to set up a teaching site on the spot. This has been reported in the newspaper before. It is now learned that Mr. Dong has rented No. 5 Zhonghe Village, east of the Sacred Heart Convent on Pushi Road in this city, as the site of the Taijiquan Association, naming it the Shanghai New Taijiquan Association. The meaning is that Taijiquan is originally an old thing in our country, but the Taijiquan Association he established is the newest. The association is scheduled to start teaching on the 1st of next month. Recently, many people have signed up with the association, which proves that there are many people in the country who love this art.</p>
<h3>Sales of Guohuo (National Goods) Doctor Soap are Brisk</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Zhongchang Soap Factory was established by Mr. Shi Dongchu, a giant in the industrial and commercial circles of North China. In view of the fact that imported soaps and enemy goods are flooding the market, and the outflow of money is alarming, he hoped to reverse the tide. In the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), he created a factory in Tianjin and worked hard to operate it in a simple manner, and only then did he have today's achievements. The factory produces more than 20 kinds of soap, all of which can be compared to imported products, and some are even better. They have been praised and commended by people in the community and have long been popular throughout the country. The people of Green South China welcome and enjoy using them. In order to promote the sales of national products, the factory set up an office in Shanghai last year, located on the second floor of No. 9 Fufu Public Firm on Fifth Malu in the Public Concession, to facilitate the purchase of customers in South China. The factory's most famous Doctor Soap sells very well, and it is said that the market has recently been unable to meet the demand.</p>

<h3>The Jiangxi Nankang Fellow Association Regularly Holds a General Meeting</h3>
<p>and seeks new members</p>
<p>Since its establishment this spring, the Jiangxi Nankang Fellow Association in Shanghai, led by Dai Yuheng, Zeng Daole, Zhan Shiwei, and others, has been actively carrying out its affairs. In view of the fact that the township has suffered from banditry for many years, and recently, thanks to the National Army's encirclement and suppression, many bandit nests have been recovered, and the aftermath matters need urgent assistance.

<h3>Impressions of Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Xu Zhenhua</p>
<p>Ever since the loss of the Northeast, the nation's attention has shifted to the Northwest, and calls for developing the Northwest have grown louder. However, the Northwest region is vast, and its resources are abundant, and the development work cannot be accomplished overnight. The local people have been displaced and suffered greatly due to years of natural disasters and man-made calamities. Before we talk about developing the Northwest, we should pay attention to improving the society of the Northwest, relieving the rural areas of the Northwest, eliminating all barriers between ethnic groups, and improving the lives of nomadic people. What follows is a public account of the observations made by the reporter in various parts of Suiyuan in recent months, which I believe will be welcomed by those who care about the Northwest.</p>
<p>(1) Opium, prostitution, and bandits in the Baotou area. Opium is one of the three deadly wounds in Suiyuan society. Taking Baotou County as an example, the prevalence of opium is even greater than that of cigarettes. Among the 1,114 shops in the city, there are more than 100 opium dens. Opium den signs with red paper lanterns can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, with names such as "Fragrant Room" or "Happy Nest," and even various humorous couplets, such as "There is a unique interest in this, and nothing is known outside of it." Local residents take a few puffs of opium to increase their energy. The best place to be happy is with a bright light far away. The names are strange and varied. There are countless vendors selling opium paraphernalia on the streets. Most of the smokers are locals, from gentry to coolies, all with opium faces. The reporter once saw a beggar in a shack, draped in two old sheepskins, lying diagonally in the mud, also smoking opium. When asked about his life, he said that he earns 10 to 20 copper coins a day by begging, half of which is used for opium and half for food. Occasionally, kind gentlemen give opium as alms, so he does not become an opium ghost. The scourge of opium in Sui province can be seen from this. Upon closer examination of the reasons for the prevalence of opium, on the one hand, it is because the habit is deeply ingrained and difficult to eradicate, and on the other hand, it is also due to the government's collection of donations for profit. In Baotou County, the annual land tax is only 8,000 yuan, while various miscellaneous taxes amount to 80,000 yuan, of which opium donations and prostitution donations account for the largest share. The method of collecting opium tax is that farmers who plant one mu of opium land must first pay a land tax of 20 yuan to the Anti-Opium Inspection Office. When the raw opium is sold, a land tax of 2 jiao per mu is collected, totaling 20 yuan and 2 jiao. As for opening opium dens, the various taxes levied are numerous. The smallest opium den must pay the following monthly taxes: 6 yuan to the Anti-Opium Rehabilitation Bureau, 2 yuan to the Finance Bureau, 2 yuan to the Land Bureau, 2 yuan to the Public Security Bureau, 4 yuan to the Stamp Tax Bureau, 1 yuan and 32 fen for the Chamber of Commerce fee, and 1 yuan and 67 fen for the business tax, totaling 18 yuan and 99 fen. In addition, there are prostitute lamp donations and good house lamp donations. Despite the heavy donations and taxes, with the intention of suppressing opium by levying taxes, the opium flame should be slightly curbed. However, in fact, farmers still plant a lot, and merchants still sell a lot, because the harvest of grain crops is at most 20 yuan per mu of good land, while planting opium can produce 100 taels of raw opium, and each tael is worth 6 jiao, which is 60 yuan. After deducting taxes, there is still 40 yuan left, which is more profitable than planting grain crops by more than half. As for setting up opium dens, about 2 yuan and 5 jiao of opium can be sold for 3 yuan. Although the profit is very thin after deducting donations and taxes, it is not difficult to make a profit from a large number of smokers. Prostitution is closely related to opium. Baotou is a hub for commercial transportation in the Northwest, and the number of prostitutes is particularly alarming. General traveling merchants, traveling to and from various places, often spare no expense to spend one or two months of hard work in the flower streets and willow alleys of Baotou. Baotou official prostitutes are divided into four grades and are managed by the joint inspection office of the military, police, and constitution. The first and second grades live in Pingkang Lane, with curled hair, leather shoes, and fashionable clothing. The third and fourth grades live in earthen houses in the Da Dingxiang Lane area, with strange and varied clothing styles. Most of the customers are poor laborers, and their donations and taxes are also paid according to their grades, including prostitute donations, prostitute door donations, prostitute lamp donations, good house lamp donations, and inspection fees. The door donation for the first grade is 21 yuan and 6 jiao per household per month, 16 yuan and 8 jiao for the second grade, 10 yuan and 8 jiao for the third grade, and no door donation for the third grade and below.</p>
<p>The prostitute donation is 2 yuan and 4 jiao per person per month for the first grade, 1 yuan and 8 jiao for the second grade, and 1 yuan and 2 jiao for the third and fourth grades and young prostitutes. The prostitute lamp donation is a donation drawn from the prostitute's opium lamp. The first, second, and third grade prostitutes each have an opium lamp for customers. The donation for the first grade is 11 yuan and 2 jiao per month, 8 yuan and 4 jiao for the second grade, and 5 yuan and 6 jiao for the third grade. The so-called good house lamp donation refers to the opium lamps set up for customers who visit occasionally in their own homes after the official prostitutes get off work, which also need to be drawn. The donation for the first and second grades is 7 jiao per month, and 5 jiao for the third and fourth grades. The inspection fee is 1 yuan and 1 jiao per month for the first grade, 1 yuan for the second grade, and 8 jiao for the third and fourth grades. In total, the county's annual prostitute donation revenue can reach 8,000 yuan. In addition to public prostitutes, there are also private prostitutes, commonly known as "broken shoes." There are many women in the streets and alleys with slightly fashionable clothes and a slightly frivolous attitude. Suiyuan is poor and desolate, and the reasons why prostitution can flourish are roughly three: one is that people's livelihoods are difficult, and it is not easy to support wives and daughters, and women in general lack productive capacity, so they are forced into prostitution; second, bandits are rampant, and there are several alarms every day, and women in rural areas cannot live in peace, and they go to the cities together, but it is even more difficult to make a living in the cities, and poor women have no way out except to sell themselves; third, it is caused by social customs. In the Baotou area, Han and Mongolian people live together, and there is no etiquette defense between Mongolian men and women. The Han people are also greatly influenced by them, and the concept of chastity and integrity is very weak. Men and women are also very free to separate and reunite. If a man does not return from doing business outside for one or two years, his wife can remarry at will. These remarried women are commonly known as "living wives." As for bandits, one is that in the past, the political situation was chaotic, and scattered soldiers became bandits, and the other is that the people's livelihood was declining and life was difficult. Most of the cunning people take risks. Since Fu Zuoyi took charge of Sui, although he has tried his best to suppress them, it is still difficult to eliminate them. In the countryside, travelers and merchants are afraid of them. However, bandits are most afraid of Mongolian people, because Mongolian people are skilled in riding and shooting, and they can shoot accurately within 100 meters. Even if it is one or two Mongolian yurts in the wilderness, bandits dare not invade them. Therefore, many merchants in Baotou request the princes of various Mongolian banners to protect them, and the princes also make a big business of their</p>
<p>bodyguard business. From Baotou to Ningxia, camel teams that are protected by Mongolian soldiers are charged 5 jiao per camel, and if there is danger on the way, they will be compensated according to the value of the goods. The above is the general situation in the Baotou area and the entire Suiyuan Province. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Unsolved - Ling Peeks at the Door, Pities the Girl's Willingness to Hear Her Hardships, Regrets Going to Visit the Poor</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Hu said: "You're talking nonsense, this is terrible. It's just that people like us have a whole bunch of relatives coming to find us. Sir, you come here! It doesn't matter, the house is very dirty, you can just sit in our yard." As they were talking, the girl had already walked into the house. At this time, she was holding the wooden board door tied with rope and sticking out half of her face, looking towards this side. Looking towards this side. When Zhizhi looked at her, she immediately shrank back. Zhizhi thought, "Old-fashioned girls are always like this. They want to look at people, but they are afraid of being looked at. This is quite interesting," so he couldn't help but smile slightly. As he smiled like this, the girl happened to stick out half of her face again. Seeing someone smiled, she also smiled. You see, although she is from Gansu, she is originally from Hunan, and she still has the delicate and beautiful appearance of a Jiangnan person. She reveals neat and snow-white teeth, and she is still lovable, especially her black and white eyes, which are also turning to the side. So he turned his face to Sister-in-law Hu and said; "That girl is your relative. What is her surname?" Sister-in-law Hu said: "Her surname is Zhu, and her name is very nice, called Yueying." Zhizhi thought, "This is also a name that ordinary girls call out rotten." So, following this meaning, he smiled slightly again. Sister-in-law Hu saw him smile twice in a row, no matter what, this was a bit meaningful. She took a step forward and said: "Please sit down, we just want to say a few words to you, we definitely don't want anything." Zhizhi was also a little shaken in his heart, and said: "Okay, you always say how hard the days are, I want to go to your house to see what kind of hardship it really is." In fact, he thought in his heart, "This girl is quite pitiful, and it is worth investigating deeply." (50)</p>
<h3>Weary Dancer</h3>
<p>— Huang Ke</p>
<p>Every night, every night, I always soak a lonely heart in a stimulating glass of wine, find a dim corner and sit quietly to let jazz music anesthetize my nerves. Every night, every night, when I am silently thinking, a string of small golden bells always wake me up from my meditation. I look up and see a girl passing by me lightly. I look carefully: "Oh, it's her again, that lonely, weary dancer!" She always comes after two or three songs have been played, quietly goes to sit on the chair by the side, opens her handbag to look in the mirror, brushes her curved hair, takes out a powder box and puts on a little powder, and then puts a touch of lipstick on her greasy lips: then she smokes a cigarette, the faint smell of Black Cat brand cigarettes paints a fog on her charmingly slender face, like a water lily drenching in the morning rain.</p>
<p>As the music starts, the lights go dim: those faces in starched white shirts and wide ties are all smiling, embracing the dancers and spinning into the smooth floor! In the melody of the music, I see her so wearily lying in the arms of that middle-aged gentleman with a cat-like mustache, her high heels turning rhythmically: the big drum booms, the lights come on, and people return to their places. I see her again with her hands on her chin, half-closed eyes, smoking a light cigarette lonely, looking very tired!</p>
<p>When the second song floated up, I rushed to her and embraced her and spun around with her in the jazz music, spinning and spinning.</p>
<p>We are both lonely people whose hearts have been crushed by the burden of life! A lotus flower drenched in morning rain is quietly sleeping in my arms.</p>
<h3>Drops</h3>
<p>— (Yiyiguan Master)</p>
<p>A person is formed by drops, these drops are "sperm" and "egg."</p>
<p>A writer's article is also formed by drops, these drops are "blood" and "brain juice."</p>
<p>A woman's money is consumed by drops, these drops are "lipstick" and "perfume."</p>
<p>The wealth of corrupt officials is accumulated by drops, these drops are "people's fat" and "people's cream."</p>
<h3>Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yin</p>
<p>My country produces tea: the most famous is Wuyi tea: Wuyi tea's tea names are divided into four grades; Wuyi tea's tea quality is also divided into four grades. The study is quiet and spotless. Holding a cup in hand and savoring it carefully, one truly feels clear and refreshing in the teeth, and the fragrance lingers in the lungs. It not only drives away the sleep demon but also adds to poetic inspiration! The details are described below:</p>
<p>Wuyi Tea's Tea Names: First, Flower Fragrance, better is called Small Species, better still is called Famous Species, and even better is called Rare Species. Flower Fragrance: officials in the city and wealthy families value it. Small Species: It is regarded as a common product in the mountains. Famous Species: It is not easy to obtain at the foot of the mountain. The Kung Fu tea that people in Quanzhou and Xiamen talk about (magnetic teapot, clay stove, charcoal fire, spring water, all exquisite; first boil, second boil, third boil, the cooking method is extremely refined, and people in Chaozhou, Guangdong, also admire it), called Famous Species, is actually only Small Species. Rare Species: It is also not easy to obtain in the mountains, with names such as Snow Plum and Papaya: roughly, tea trees that are close to plum blossoms will attract the taste of plum blossoms: those that are close to papaya will attract the taste of papaya, and other things can be deduced in the same way. It must be mountain water to develop its essence!</p>
<p>Wuyi Tea's Tea Quality: First, Fragrant: such as the Flower Fragrance and Small Species. Better is called Clear: fragrant but not clear is still an ordinary product. Better still is called Sweet: clear but not sweet is bitter tea. Even better is called Alive: fragrant but not alive is just good tea. The word "alive" must be distinguished from the tip of the tongue. It must also be mountain water to understand this news!</p>
<p>The above-mentioned tea names: tea qualities: Lu Yu's Tea Classic has not fully recorded them. Wuyi Miscellaneous Poem by Sen Yueting of Fuzhou: "He will be surprised by his peers in the future, drinking truly to the point of saliva returning." If one does not go to the mountains in person and drink the immortal liquid, one cannot say these words! It can be seen that tea's color, fragrance, and taste are all complete, but it especially needs spring water and especially relies on frying. If there is a Lu Tong in the world, it is not difficult to find an understanding person!</p>
<h3>The Pathology of a Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<h3>Hundred Yuan Deposit for a Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>Every industry has a way to treat customers favorably. In the old days, among the 360 industries, only the pedantic teachers who opened "Zi Yue Stores" had no way to attract students other than posting a red paper strip with "Home has a School" in front of the door. However, I heard an anecdote from the older generation. It is said that there were two private schools not far from each other, and both wanted to attract students, so of course they had to come up with a way to treat customers favorably. Whenever students came to the school to study, if it rained, the teacher would definitely find a way to carry the students home on his back. He posted another advertisement next to the red paper strip saying "Free Ride Home in the Rain." Sure enough, the students were thriving and the door was full. Another private school was affected by this, so he went one step further in treating customers favorably. Not only would he carry them home on his back in the rain, but he would also carry them on sunny days. So he posted an advertisement saying "Free Ride Home Even on Sunny Days" to resist. As a result, the thriving students abandoned the other school and came to this school.</p>
<p>Recently, some bankers have learned this trick. Not only are the interest rates preferential, but there are also gifts attached. They have advanced from "Free Ride Home in the Rain" to "Free Ride Home Even on Sunny Days." Is this really a special benefit for customers? A certain classmate, who is the son of a bank manager, once raised a question: "What is the most preferential interest rate in the banking industry now? It is probably enough to double the principal in five years. If you deposit 100 yuan, it will be settled every five years, and the interest will continue to accrue. How much should the principal and interest be after a hundred years? Gentlemen, you don't need to think, just answer casually." So, some guessed thousands of yuan, some guessed tens of thousands of yuan, and some boldly replied, guessing up to hundreds of thousands of yuan. Such guesses earned the classmate's endless head shaking.</p>
<p>Finally, people asked him how much principal and interest there would actually be. The classmate said: "After a hundred years, even a bank with abundant capital would have to give the entire bank to this 100-yuan depositor."</p>
<p>People heard this and expressed disbelief. The classmate said: "Once you calculate it, you will understand. If you deposit 100 yuan and double it every five years, after ten years, the principal and interest will be 400 yuan. After thirty years, the principal and interest will be 6,400 yuan. After fifty years, the principal and interest will be 102,400 yuan. After eighty years, the principal and interest will be 6,553,600 yuan. After a hundred years, the principal and interest will total 104,857,600 yuan. According to this, I'm afraid that just giving him a bank is not enough to pay the principal and interest of this 100-yuan depositor!"</p>
<h3>Talking About Chinese Regular Script</h3>
<p>— Xie Yiou</p>
<p>Since Cangjie created characters in our country, animal hoof and bird tracks, tadpole bell tripods, Qin seal, and Han clerical script have been improved from time to time, with convenience and beauty as the goal. When the regular script came out, it was completed. Its fonts are upright, its strokes are beautiful, and its use is convenient. It is the most suitable font recognized by our nation. Since the Jin Dynasty to the present, for thousands of years, all members of our nation who are literate and practice calligraphy have recognized and practiced it, and regarded it as the standard. During the Ming and Qing imperial examinations, it was even used as the standard for taking and removing candidates in the palace examination. In terms of printing, ancient books from the Song and Yuan dynasties, especially those beautifully carved by aristocratic families, used regular script fonts. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, finely carved books by aristocratic families have also often used regular script fonts. However, ordinary craftsmen who do not understand calligraphy recklessly carved swans and transmitted them over and over again, resulting in a style that is neither clerical nor regular, which is now called "Ming style," commonly known as "Old Song style." Since the Ming Dynasty, it has been commonly used in workshops and has almost become the font exclusively used in woodblock printing in our country, resulting in a clear separation of the written fonts in our country, which has made it feel that there are many obstacles to promoting culture and popularizing education. Since the adoption of machinery in the modern printing industry, the Japanese have reproduced the "Ming style" characters into copper molds and imported them into our country. The fact that machine printing in our country has Ming style copper molds is actually supplied by the Japanese. Its influence is gradually occupying the book and newspaper agencies in our country, and the cultural invasion is chilling.</p>
<p>Giants in the Shanghai literary and art circles such as Li Zuhan, Zheng Wuchang, and Chen Xiaodie, felt this and raised huge funds to create Chinese regular script movable type. From first to sixth, all have been released, and a printing factory has been established to cast characters and test printing. For three years, they have printed as many as 250,000 kinds of books, documents, and sizes. The grand works such as the Railway Yearbook, the National Salt Administration Records, and the National Bank Yearbook are all typeset with this regular script movable type. The beauty of the results has been recognized by all walks of life. More than 350 printing companies across the country have adopted Chinese regular script lead type for printing.</p>
<p>It is now heard that in order to promote the inherent culture and improve modern printing, the bureau is willing to sell the Chinese regular script movable type, which has been painstakingly created through careful management, and also reproduce copper molds for sale, so that printing colleagues across the country can purchase and use them to increase their business. If this regular script character, which occupies an important position in our country's past cultural history of 2,000 years and is still suitable for our modern 400 million people, is adopted by the majority of colleagues, its strength will be able to restore the field in our printing industry that has been occupied by Japanese-made Ming style characters. There is no limit to its contribution to the future of culture and education in our country! (Thanks for the reward)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou from the original work of Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>There was also a group of people who were qualified to receive the Empress Dowager at the station first, but they happened to be occupied with extremely important duties at that time and could not leave their offices. These two groups of people then rushed to the side of the imperial road to kowtow to the Empress Dowager, not intending to perform the reception ceremony as a supplement.</p>
<p>Although these hundreds of Manchu soldiers were dispatched by Huai Tabu to protect the Empress Dowager, they were now considered to have entered the Forbidden City. Within the Forbidden City, no troops other than the Imperial Guards were originally allowed to enter. Now that they had forced their way in, they were absolutely forbidden to carry weapons. Readers, just imagine, how difficult this situation really was. Although their mission here was said to be to protect the Empress Dowager, which meant that they would be directly responsible if anything unfortunate happened to the Empress Dowager, they were not allowed to carry weapons. Were they supposed to resist assassins or rebels with their bare hands? Wasn't this deliberately making things difficult for them? But we don't need to worry about them too much, because at that time, not many Chinese people possessed things like pistols or bombs. If anyone wanted to assassinate the Empress Dowager, they would inevitably still use knives and swords, and it would not be easy to act in the midst of so many people with just knives and swords. So, in fact, there was no way any trouble would occur! Huai Tabu's reason for dispatching these hundreds of Banner soldiers was more accurately described as being to curry favor with the Empress Dowager than to sincerely protect her.</p>
<p>When I was sitting in my sedan chair, passing through that city gate, I still followed the old custom, pulled back the sedan curtains a little, and tried my best to peek at the scenery outside. Therefore, I saw very clearly that on the city walls of this imperial city, there were already many peeling and mottled old bricks that had fallen to the ground, and many had been privately dismantled. Moreover, because no one had repaired them for a long time, weeds grew everywhere, and the solemn atmosphere that should have been there was completely lost. (160)</p>

<h3>DC Multimeter</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Whether for repairing, manufacturing, or testing all radio equipment, an accurate multimeter is an indispensable instrument. However, to measure voltage, there is a voltmeter; to measure current, there is an ammeter or milliammeter; and to measure resistance, there is an ohmmeter. Each type of meter also has a different range of measurement. If one were to prepare all these meters, it would be beyond the economic capacity of us amateur researchers. Fortunately, although the functions of various meters are different, their structures are actually quite similar. The only difference is the different matching of accessories. Therefore, one meter can be transformed into multiple uses. This universal meter in this article uses only one 0-1 DC milliammeter, equipped with the simplest accessories, to accurately measure voltage, current, and resistance. With this one instrument, all the problems in radio equipment can be easily solved.</p>
<p>1. Voltage Measurement: To measure voltage with this meter, connect it to the terminals labeled "Voltage". SW1 must be turned off. The shunt key SW2 should be turned to the IMA position, and then rotate SW3 to the appropriate range. Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are multipliers to differentiate the voltage range. Their values can be obtained using the following formula:</p>
<p>For example, if R1 is 10,000 ohms, the voltage range can be measured up to 10 volts; if R2 is 100,000 ohms, it can be measured up to 100 volts; if R3 is 1,000,000 ohms, it can be measured up to 1,000 volts. When SW3 is at the 10V position, the meter's reading should be multiplied by 10, and so on.</p>
<p>2. Current Measurement: When measuring current, connect to the "Current" terminals. SW1 should still be turned off. Rotate SW2 to the appropriate range. Resistors R4, R5, and R6 are shunts connected in parallel with the meter. Although their values can also be calculated using a formula, it is difficult to be accurate because their resistance is extremely small, and even a slight difference is unacceptable. Approximately, if the current range is increased by a factor of ten, the shunt resistance is only one-tenth of the meter's own resistance, and so on. Therefore, it is best to use another accurate milliammeter to connect in series with it in a circuit to calibrate it using the cut-and-try method. The most important thing to note is that if SW2 is not in complete contact with the appropriate shunt, do not connect it to the circuit for measurement, otherwise, there is a risk of burning it out.</p>
<p>3. Resistance Measurement: The circuit for measuring resistance in this meter is a voltage division method, which is different from the ordinary variable resistance method. Its characteristic is that even if the battery voltage gradually drops, it will not affect the accuracy of the meter. R7 is a 50,000-ohm potentiometer. The battery can be four small round dry cells connected in series, for a total of six volts. R8 must be an absolutely accurate standard resistance of 5,000 ohms. SW4 is a push-button switch. The measurement method is as follows: If the resistance is in the range of 0-20 ohms, it can be connected to the CL terminals. If it is in the range of 200-5M ohms, it should be connected between CH. Turn on SW1, hold down SW4, rotate R7 to make the meter pointer reach the top point LMA, and then release SW4 to read the resistance value from the meter.</p>
<h3>Two Excellent Filters</h3>
<p>— D.</p>
<p>In English, the two words "Wave Trap" and "Filter" are both translated as "濾波器" (lǜ bō qì, filter) in Chinese. In fact, the meanings of these two words are not the same. A Wave Trap is a filter used for antennas, and a Filter is a filter used for power supplies. The following introduces one Wave Trap and one Filter.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, this is a filter composed of a variable capacitor and a variometer. When the switch is flipped to the left, the capacitor and the coil are connected in series, which can increase the effectiveness of the radio. If there is interference, flip the switch to the right, then the capacitor and the coil are connected in parallel, forming an excellent filter.</p>
<p>Figure 2 is a Filter. The coil is wound with No. 18 double silk-covered wire on a 2-inch diameter tube, with a total of 200 turns. Install it as shown in the diagram, which can prevent noise from the power supply from being transmitted to your radio. (Note: the capacitor must be high-voltage resistant.)</p>
<h3>Introduction to a Single-Tube Dual-Effect Radio</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Recently, new multi-purpose vacuum tubes have become quite popular in amateur circles, mainly due to their amazing effectiveness and economical use, which were unprecedented. The invention of this kind of vacuum tube has truly satisfied the general amateur researchers' extravagant expectations and fulfilled the dreams of countless radio enthusiasts. It must be said to be a great miracle in the progress of radio. There are many types of multiplex vacuum tubes, and this publication has introduced many of them, so it seems that there is no need to repeat them. Here, I would like to introduce a radio circuit made with a No. 53 multiplex tube for readers to adopt.</p>
<p>This machine is made with a 53 dual-purpose triode. This type of vacuum tube is similar to 10, but because it is suitable for AC power, it has more than 19. It has one cathode. Its filament voltage is 2.5V, and the current is 2A, which is only 0.25A more than the 27 vacuum tube, but its function is more than twice as strong as 27. The tube contains two triodes with higher amplification factors. When used as Class B amplification, its effect is particularly noticeable. In this machine, I used it as a first-stage detector and a first-stage low-frequency amplifier. Because the amplification factor is quite high, the volume is louder than that of ordinary two-tube machines. It is not a problem to receive local broadcasts with a loudspeaker, and it will never be as quiet as a mosquito buzzing.</p>
<p>The circuit is very ordinary and is a regenerative type known to everyone in the amateur world. The regenerator is controlled by a 0-25000 ohm resistor, so the refabrication is exceptionally stable. The low-frequency transformer ratio should not be too high, and 3:1 is the most suitable. RFC generally suitable for long waves can be used. In addition, the wiring is nothing special. The high-voltage output of the power supply needs to be 180V, and the low voltage is 2.5V. The 71 rectifier tube can be used. The coil and other component capacities are listed below:</p>
<p>Coil — A one-and-a-half-inch radius rubber tube L20 turns L175 turns L30 turns are wound on a one-inch diameter rubber tube, all using No. 28 wire.</p>
<p>C —— ·0005 MFD variable capacitor</p>
<p>C1 —— ·00025 MFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C2 —— ·5 MFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C3 —— ·006 MFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C4 —— ·5 MFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>R —— 3MFG grid leak</p>
<p>R1 —— 400 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>R2 —— 0 to 25000 variable resistor</p>
<p>R3 —— 50000 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>T —— 3:1 low frequency transformer</p>
<p>V53 vacuum tube</p>
<p>RFC —— high frequency choke</p>
<h3>Radio Broadcasting in Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Broadcasting Stations</p>
<p>Geographically, Japan can be divided into seven districts by the Broadcasting Corporation. Each district has a 10-kilowatt large radio station and several small-power radio stations, totaling twenty-five. These many radio stations are responsible for relaying news and exchanging programs, so they are very organized and well-trained. The call signs and power of the seven large radio stations are shown in the table on the right:</p>
<p>Station Name Call Sign Power Frequency Wavelength</p>
<p>(1) Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station JOAK 10 KW First—870 KC 345 Second—590 KC 508</p>
<p>(2) Osaka Central Broadcasting Station JOBK 10 KW First—750 KC 400 Second—1085 KC 276</p>
<p>(3) Nagoya Central Broadcasting Station JOCK 10 KW First—810 KC 370 Second—1175 KC 255</p>
<p>(4) Hiroshima Central Broadcasting Station JOFK 10 KW 850 KC 353</p>
<p>(5) Kumamoto Central Broadcasting Station JOGK 10 KW 790 KC 380</p>
<p>(6) Sendai Central Broadcasting Station JOHK 10 KW 770 KC 390</p>
<p>(7) Sapporo Central Broadcasting Station JOIK 10 KW 830 KC 360</p>
<p>Among the twenty-five radio stations, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are the old seniors in the broadcasting industry, with the latest machinery, talented people, and they all use two different wavelengths to broadcast two different programs simultaneously. Other radio stations such as OBG, JODG, and JOXK are also located in important cities. In terms of machinery, except for the three old seniors, they are all manufactured in Japan. Because most of the broadcasting station buildings do not meet the needs of modern radio stations, there are quite a few under construction or planning. Due to political, geographical, and economic differences, the broadcasting industry in Korea and Taiwan is not directly under the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. The broadcasting station in Korea is managed by the Korea Broadcasting Corporation. Seoul Central Broadcasting Station JODK also uses two wavelengths to broadcast simultaneously (333 meters and 492 meters). The power is ten kilowatts. The 333-meter one broadcasts in Japanese, and the 492-meter one broadcasts in Korean.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the broadcasting industry is handled by the Taiwan Broadcasting Corporation. Taiwan currently has two radio stations, one in Taipei Prefecture (JFAK, 448 meters, 10 KW) and one in Tainan City (JFBK, 417 meters, 10 KW). Both the Korea Broadcasting Corporation and the Taiwan Broadcasting Corporation are directly managed and supported by the local Governor-General. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Single-Tube Travel Radio</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>— Long reception range, clear sound insulation —</p>
<p>Circuit description: The excellence of a radio's efficiency does not depend solely on the strength of the power, or the complexity of the circuit. Even a small-power radio, as long as it is properly designed and configured, can easily achieve good results. Therefore, in the minds of us amateur researchers, a small one- or two-tube machine is enough to satisfy people. The travel-style single-tube machine that the author is going to introduce now is a kind of excellent small radio that meets our ideals. The circuit uses super-regenerative type, and the long reception range is of course expected. However, the selectivity of ordinary radios of this type is not very good. Now, the regeneration circle of this machine adopts a special device, and of course the improvement of selectivity is very considerable.</p>
<p>Application of other parts</p>
<p>The parts used in this machine are extremely simple; most of them are those found in ordinary single-tube machines, and only a few need to be purchased again. Now, the values, capacities, and manufacturing methods of each part are described in detail below for reference.</p>
<p>(1) C · Variable capacitor for adjusting wavelength, capacity is 00035MFD</p>
<p>(2) C1 · Variable capacitor for adjusting regenerative power</p>
<p>Capacity is ·0003MFD</p>
<p>(3) C2 · Grid capacitor capacity is ·0001MFD</p>
<p>(4) C3 · Bypass capacitor capacity is ·004MFD</p>
<p>(5) C4 · Bypass capacitor capacity is ·002MFD</p>
<p>(6) LL1L2 · Manufacturing method of three or four loop coils ·· Three spider web boards can be used, one winding ten turns as L, one winding seventy turns as L1, and one winding fifty turns as L2. After winding with twenty-six-gauge enameled wire, install it with a three- or four-way rotating</p>
<p>Frame, for adjustment.</p>
<p>(7) L3L4 · Manufacturing method of induction coil; use twenty-six-gauge enameled wire to wind L3, thirty-five</p>
<p>Turns on the spider web board; wind L4 thirty-five turns on another spider web board with the same gauge wire, and then install it with a rotating frame for adjustment.</p>
<p>(8) L5L6 · Manufacturing method of oscillation coil: wind 1200 turns of 30-gauge enameled wire on a one-diameter tube to make L5. Do not cut it off. Just pull out one end. Then wind 1000 turns to make L6. It is not necessary to be neat and beautiful when winding, and random winding is fine.</p>
<p>(9) R3MFG grid leak</p>
<p>(10) V15 DC side heat vacuum tube, this type of vacuum tube has not been introduced for a long time, and amateur comrades naturally have more diaphragms about it. Now, I will give a special introduction to the latter to help my fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>No. 15 vacuum tube is the latest DC vacuum tube introduced to the market. Its structure is similar to the 38·44 type. Because it is not directly heated by the filament, it is most suitable for use as a detector in travel machines, so that there will be no miscellaneous noises. Its characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>Filament voltage two volts Filament current ○·Two two amps</p>
<p>Screen voltage one hundred and thirty-five volts Screen current one·Eight five milliamps</p>
<p>Shield voltage sixty-seven·Five volts Grid voltage one·Five volts</p>
<p>(10) (1) A battery Two-volt battery</p>
<p>(10) (2) B battery 45-volt small B battery</p>
<p>(10) (3) J socket other headphones, lamp holder junction post, etc.</p>
<p>Adjustment procedure: The adjustment procedure of this machine is quite tight during the first test. However, after the procedure is completed, there is no difference from an ordinary regenerative single-tube machine. The first adjustment method is as follows: First, rotate C to the desired wavelength, then rotate C1 to the loudest sound, and at the same time adjust the distance between L·2 and L31·4, to make the sound clear. After this step is completed, you can fix it, and only adjust C1 to control the regeneration.</p>
<p>Attached: This machine is extremely sensitive to sound reception. Usually, there is no need for a ground wire. If L2 is connected to the grid capacitor and dragged with</p>
<p>A twenty-foot flower line will give better results.</p>

<h3>Conflicting Financial News Leads to Chaotic Gold Market</h3>
<p>Once Surpassed 90 Yuan</p>
<p>Ended Up Falling 5 Yuan and 3 Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was volatile and unpredictable, but the price fluctuations were relatively small. Rumors circulated in the market, with prices first rising and then falling. Market conditions appeared manipulated. Actual observations showed that the bulls and bears were closely matched (currently 57 bulls versus 60 bears). Selling sentiment was easily stirred up. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US rose, and exchange rates had begun to contract. London spot gold continued to fall by four pence. Initial expectations outside the market were for a stable opening, followed by weakness, mainly because the Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar contracting by 0.0625. However, customs gold fell by another 0.05 taels. Although prices managed to rise after the opening, the bank quickly supplied large quantities, and major players were keen to sell. The 80-yuan mark was eventually broken, and the price fluctuations began. However, those who maintained positions during the dip were strong enough to improve the situation. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced official rates, with the pound rising by 0.25 and the US dollar increasing by 0.375. At this time, the major players' desire to sell had not diminished, making a rapid rise difficult. However, due to slight gains in Guangdong, prices hovered around 80 yuan. Later, someone, seeing that the gold market was unlikely to fall, seized the opportunity to buy aggressively, causing prices to rise. However, because the bank was still holding back, many deals occurred after the rise. Then, rumors spread that a certain association was aggressively advancing futures positions, and buyers in the market became more aggressive, even pushing prices past the 90-yuan mark. After this, the market became crowded with retail investors, and there were many sellers at high prices, leading to a decline. However, market sentiment had already improved, and people's confidence increased, causing buying interest to become even more enthusiastic, pushing prices past the 90-yuan mark again and even higher. The midday close was slightly flat, but prices fell after the market closed. Subsequently, a private telegram report from the Hoosheng Trading Company stated that certain informed sources predicted that India would purchase large quantities of silver next year to replenish the large amounts of gold it had sold in the past. Although this had little direct impact, the general psychology was that silver prices would rise. Combined with the lingering momentum from the midday close, prices fell immediately upon opening. Shunmao sold aggressively in the market, and the selling pressure was overwhelming, leading to rumors of sales by certain two banks. With dampened confidence, prices retreated into the 80-yuan range. The foreign exchange market was mediocre, and major players maintained their positions during the dip, gradually pushing prices back above 80 yuan, creating a stable appearance. However, the overall trend was weak, and selling sentiment was easily triggered. In an instant, another price fluctuation began, and prices fell to 75.30 yuan. Afterwards, although the Bombay silver market rose by six annas, the domestic market was flat. Buyers gradually became active, gradually pushing prices back above 80 yuan. The bank even had a desire to buy, causing prices to rise further. Ultimately, however, the sellers prevailed, and prices retreated back into the 80-yuan range. Although the difference between the highest and lowest prices for the day was only a little over ten yuan, the fluctuations were extremely rapid and unexpected. The following is a record of the market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 981 yuan, down 3.40 yuan from the previous close. The Central Bank announced official rates, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar contracting by 0.0625. Customs gold fell by 0.05 taels, and prices fell to 0.02 jiao. Hengyu, Dafa, Yongyuanmao, Yongshen, and Conner all rose to 3 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongshunmao, Qianchangxiang, Yongfeng, and Shenkang all sold. The bank aggressively held back January sterling gold at 0.0625. The 80-yuan mark was broken, and prices fell to 77 yuan. Fuchang, Fuyu, Yuanchun, Yuqing, Yongheng, Yuyuanmao, and Yong all bought, pushing prices above 80 yuan. HSBC announced official rates, with the pound rising by 0.25 and the US dollar rising by 0.375. Prices once fell to 79 yuan. Yuqing, Yongfu, Xingyongheng, and Yu continued to buy, and prices rose again to 81 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongchun, Yuanyong, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, etc., sold, and prices later fell to 77.50 yuan. Shengda and Hengxing bought, and prices rose to 80 yuan. Jiaotong and Mecgary jointly offered January US dollars at 4.375, and rumors spread that someone was aggressively covering positions. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Fuxing, Yonghuixiang, Yuansheng, Yonghongxing, etc., competed to buy, pushing prices to 86.50 yuan. Huabi offered January sterling gold at 3.125. Yuanmao and Yongchunyuanyong sold at 5.50 yuan, and Hengyu, etc., bought again at 7 yuan. January US dollars at 3.125 were difficult to settle. Qianchangxiang and Yuanmaoyong sold, and prices retreated to 5.50 yuan. Confidence had improved, and someone continued to compete to buy. Xiangxingyong, Rendecheng, Hengyu, Dingchang, Dalian Gang, Dafa, Yonghengxing, Yuanyuanxiang, and Heyuanxing Futaiheng, etc., aggressively bought, pushing prices to 91 yuan. Yuqingyong, etc., sold, and prices retreated to 88.20 yuan. Mecgary offered January shillings at four pence. Fuxingyong, Dadecheng paid, and prices rose above 90 yuan. Futaiheng, Fuxingyong, Yongli, Yifengyong, etc., sold again, and prices fell to 86.50 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongtongchunyuan, Xiangdalian Gang, Dingchang, Changsheng Yong, etc., bought, and prices rose to 93.50 yuan, even though Yuanmao, Yongfuxing, Yong took the opportunity to supply at high prices. Tianfeng, Fuyu, Yuanshengyong, and Chunyuanyong, etc., took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and prices gradually fell. The midday close retreated to 991.20 yuan, and prices gradually fell after the market closed.</p>
<p>The post-market opening was 987.70 yuan. Shunmao and Fuxingyong's selling pressure was overwhelming. Yuanmao, Yongtongfu, Dafa, Yongdadecheng, etc., also sold, and prices fell to 77 yuan. The market was ordinary, and there were still buyers during the dip. Shengda, Tianfeng, Fuyu, Fuan, Dalian Gang, Dafa Yong, etc., all bought, pushing prices to 83 yuan. Hongxing, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and Dingchang sold, retreating to 1.30 yuan. Dingkang, Fuyu, Hengyu, and Fuxingyong still paid, raising prices to 2.60 yuan. However, selling pressure had not diminished, and confidence was still weak. Fuxingyong, Dingkang, Dafa Yong, and Yicheng slightly sold, causing prices to fluctuate and fall to 75.30 yuan. After entering the market, although Bombay rose by six annas, Citibank offered January US dollars at 3.75. Dadecheng, Tongchun, Yuanshengyong, Yuanchangyong, etc., paid, gradually pushing prices up. The domestic market was still good, and buying interest was still strong. Citibank offered January US dollars again at 3.125, and prices rebounded to 83.80 yuan. Hanh Heng, Yuanmao, Yongdingchang, Qianchangxiang, Dafayong, Yuanfengyong, etc., sold together, and prices broke the 80-yuan mark again near the close. The closing price was 979.30 yuan. After the market closed, Daxingyong, etc., paid, stabilizing the situation. The highest price for the day was 993.50 yuan, and the lowest price was 975.30 yuan, a difference of 18.20 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 5.10 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was 985.70 yuan due to the Central Bank's standard gold price, which was about 6 yuan lower than the closing price, and 1 yuan stronger than the previous close. The old standard for November, due to HSBC's US exchange rate rising by 0.375, was 32.625, which corresponds to a standard gold price of 1060 yuan. The registration price in the morning was 993 yuan for November and 991 yuan for December. The registration price in the afternoon was 981 yuan for November and 979 yuan for December. The morning supplement was 993 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was 981 yuan. The card gold price was 991 yuan. Many customers in the market supplied, with the Tianjin Gang selling about 1,000 taels to Yingfenghang and Heng, calculated with an additional 12.50 yuan, which is for delivery in two weeks, and the spot price is hedged against the futures price. Therefore, Hengyu, etc., paid Yingfenghang and Heng 1.40 yuan. In addition, Dingtai sold 182 contracts to Wanxing, with Dingtai paying 1.20 yuan. The source of spot goods has been strong recently, because the November public orders are about to be collected and settled.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were confusing. In summary, Shunmao, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Hengxingyuan, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Zhaofengchang, Yuqingyong, Tongfenghang, Yonglixing, Yingxiangyuan, Dayong, Hongkangyong, Qingyu Tianfeng, etc., were on the selling side. Fuyu, Dachangxiang, Tongtaichang, Futai Huixianghe, Hengchang, Yongchangsheng Yongrenfa, Shuishengda, Shunli, etc., were on the buying side. Dingchang, Yuanmao, Yongyuansheng, Tongchunbingxing, Dakang, advanced and exited later. Tianfeng, Hengyu, Fuan, Hengtai, Fuxingyong, exited first and entered later. In addition, there were rumors that someone was aggressively buying in the morning and that certain two banks were aggressively selling in the afternoon. Yishengyongheng transferred a large number to Yuanmaoyong. Dalian Gang and Gaoxing jointly did 3,300, breaking even, gaining more than 400 contracts. Guang Gang Shengda entered about 500-600 contracts and exited about 200 contracts. Hengxing's entries and exits were scattered.</p>
<h3>Flat Foreign Exchange Market; Dollar Loosens</h3>
<p>Tight Then Loose, The Process Was Erratic</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London's long-term and short-term interest rates both rose by 0.0625, the US silver price increased by 0.125, London's raw gold fell by 4 pence, the British pound fell by 1.25 points against the US dollar, the US dollar fell by 1.125 points against the British pound, the British pound fell by 18 points against the French franc, and the US dollar rose by 125 points against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term price for British exchange at 1 shilling and 4 pence, 125, and the US exchange rate at 33.3125 yuan. After the opening, the Central Bank's listing was flat for the British pound and reduced by 0.0625 for the US dollar, with the customs gold price 5% lower. However, because the bank's appetite tended to be firm, it was anticipated that HSBC's listing would increase by 25 points for the British pound and 375 points for the US dollar, and the domestic market hardened for a time. But because the bank took advantage of the cheap prices to cover its positions, it remained stable. As the gold market rebounded, the psychology of Chinese merchants turned positive, and they came back to cover their positions. The process tightened repeatedly, but at noon the bank still held firm, and the underlying trend was flat. In the afternoon, as the gold market plummeted, people's confidence wavered, and the bank also slightly loosened its position. But although it loosened, it was minimal. The Bombay cable reported an increase of 6 annas. The banks traded with each other, and there was no change. In the end, it improved slightly, and the closing price for the near-term selling price was 1 shilling and 4 pence, 0625, and the US exchange rate was 33.375 yuan, which was flat for the British pound and 125 points looser for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants covered their positions from time to time, and the dollar transaction was mostly flat, with a slight covering of the British pound. The bank's appetite was quite reciprocal, but the overall situation was very confusing. Here is the day's transaction record:</p>
<p>The British exchange market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence 125.</p>
<p>Zhenjin Huabi offered January at 0625, and Huabi sold November to Mecgary at 125. Sanjiao sold to HSBC spot at 125. Pangen covered January at 125. Huabi offered January at 0625. HSBC issued Huabi December at 0625. Shanghai sold to Mecgary January at 0625. Mecgary paid January at 1 shilling and 4 pence. Shanghai issued Jincheng November at 0625. Shanghai Jincheng sold to Mecgary February at 1 shilling and 4 pence. The mid-day market closed with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence.

Citibank HSBC paid the same price in the same month. Citibank covered January at 375 and 3125. The closing near-term selling price was 33.375 yuan. Forward 25 and 3125. Purchase prices are added at 0625.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Interbank Lending Rates Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Although the silver and money industries were affected by the recession in the previous two long-term interbank lending periods, they were still able to cope. However, the difficulty in issuing loans this time has made it even more difficult for the industry to move forward or backward, causing most market participants to adopt a wait-and-see approach.

<h3>Rapid Changes in the Securities and Government Bond Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange only traded November futures for one month. There was a slight possibility of prices trending higher, but the Fifth National Congress of Representatives temporarily postponed the term, and there were unfounded rumors in the market, causing prices to rise slightly and then gradually decline. The future remains uncertain, and the environment is constantly changing. The following is a summary of yesterday's events: The morning opening was only slightly higher, and prices gradually weakened thereafter, mostly due to retail investors selling. The secondary market caused some of the bulls to sell, resulting in a uniform decline of 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors persisted, and sellers were even more eager, causing prices to fall by another 0.05-0.4 yuan. The closing prices varied slightly, but overall there were more declines than gains. The overall result was a decline of 0.15-0.4 yuan, with a total transaction volume of 6,615,000 yuan. The following is a table showing the results of the price fluctuations for 20 stocks (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share):</p>

<h3>US Stock Market Sees Profit-Taking, Leading to Decline</h3>
<p>According to a report from New Fook Trading Company, the New York stock market on the 25th initially opened higher due to President Roosevelt's speech, but it subsequently declined again due to a sharp drop of $10 in the bonds of the Baldwin Locomotive Works on the small exchange. The company's financial report stated that the company's working capital was depleted due to losses and bond interest payments. At the same time, speculators had overbought railroad stocks, and the bond market was mixed, with the small exchange also experiencing tremors. Chicago wheat prices rose due to a lack of demand and weakness in the Canadian market. The total daily trading volume was 1.03 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is as follows:</p>

<h3>Unresolved Yarn and Flower Unified Tax Issue Leads to Potential Shutdowns at Spinning Mills</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Firms, Rumors Fly About the Market</p>
<p>Rumors are swirling in the market that an increase in the unified tax on cotton yarn is inevitable. Spinning mills believe that sales are already sluggish and that the increased unified tax will inevitably reduce consumption. Some say that spinning mills may shut down to resist the conditions. At the same time, short positions are being covered, and market sentiment is agitated, causing the market to rise.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster All Good Yuan Yi</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton yarn futures market, prices for November initially fell by 1.1 yuan due to falling US cotton prices and a lack of market confidence. Prices for December fell by only 0.6 yuan, and the market tightened in the longer term. However, prices suddenly rebounded after the 2nd and 3rd rounds, and buying sentiment intensified due to rumors in the market that spinning mills might shut down to protest the increased unified tax. As a result, buyers and short-covering traders entered the market, and the market closed flat. Overall, prices for each month rose by 0.7-1.0 yuan. In the afternoon, market conditions remained strong. There were reports that approximately 1,000 bales of spot yarn were traded, and short positions were still being covered. Prices for each month rose by another 0.1-0.4 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 40,400 bales. The largest sellers were Dafeng (850 bales), Jifeng (1,300 bales), Yuanda (500 bales), Jinchang (2,200 bales), Yuanda (450 bales), Changyu (450 bales), Shenji (900 bales), Tongxing (550 bales), Yichang (1,250 bales), Changfeng (1,900 bales), Runkang (2,000 bales), and Dachang (550 bales).

<p>Shantou: 100  Xuzhou: 20  Northern Guild: 20</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 145 Ningbo: 15  Sichuan: 20</p>
<h3>Cotton Initially Weak, Then Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market was initially weak due to rumors that spinning mills might shut down and falling US cotton prices, which softened market sentiment. Later, it was heard that gold prices had rebounded, and the market improved slightly. In the afternoon, short-covering traders entered the market, and the situation tightened slightly. However, trading was thin, and inventory decreased by one-third. The market changes are expected to be reduced temporarily.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Rebounds by 0.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton futures market, prices fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan for each month due to a further decline of 10 points in US cotton prices, flat gold prices, and prevalent rumors that spinning mills might shut down. Buyers were scarce. However, prices rebounded by 0.5 yuan after the second round. The market improved suddenly after the third closing when it was heard that gold prices had rebounded to 92.30 yuan. As a result, near-term prices fell by 0.05-0.15 yuan, while long-term prices remained flat. In the afternoon, the market continued the momentum from the morning, and more traders covered their profits. Prices for each month rose by 0.05-0.25 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 74,800 dan. The largest sellers were Dafeng (1,600 dan), Suilong (1,000 dan), Jinchang (2,200 dan), Shenchang (2,500 dan), Changfeng (1,800 dan), Xincheng (4,300 dan), Gengfeng (2,900 dan), Changyu (1,000 dan), Yuande (2,800 dan), and Taichang (1,800 dan).

<h3>Spot Cotton Arrivals Surge, Sales Stagnate</h3>

<p>Shashi Cotton: 42.75, Yongan Mill Takes Delivery: 500 Pieces of Spot Goods Delivered at Warehouse</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange Cancels Special Deposit for Cotton</h3>
<p>Since the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added an equalization tax, the foreign exchange market suddenly became tight. Gold prices soared, and market sentiment became strong. Commodity prices rose rapidly, an unprecedented phenomenon. On the 18th, the October cotton yarn futures contract soared by 4.5 yuan. Buyers for the November contract were bidding as high as 200 yuan. The market was chaotic, and the bulls and bears were deadlocked. Subsequently, the board of directors announced that a special deposit of 8 yuan per bale of cotton yarn and 2 yuan per dan of cotton would be required for all new cotton yarn and cotton transactions. This temporarily suppressed the price surge and allowed the November contract to be reopened, which soared by 8.5 yuan in the first round, an extremely rare occurrence. The market announced yesterday that the special deposit of 8 yuan per bale of cotton yarn and 2 yuan per dan of cotton would be canceled for all transactions made from the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Initially Rallies on Bullish Sentiment, Then Weakens Due to Profit-Taking</h3>
<p>US cotton initially rallied due to positive news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to a weak Wall Street market and profit-taking. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 9-11 points. UK cotton futures rose by 1-2 points. Indian cotton weakened due to selling by a few speculators. Pulgore fell by 0.25 rupees, and Umra and Bai Luoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegraphic report is as follows (dated 25th):</p>
<p>US Cotton  Change from Previous Day  Equivalent in National Currency  UK Cotton  Change from Previous Day  Equivalent in National Currency</p>
<p>December 12.27 Down 11 41.90  October 6.71 Flat  47.70</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Withdraw Chips</p>
<p>Flour Market Suddenly Turns Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for all months showed an initial weak followed by a firm trend. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago fell by about 5.5-6 jiao, Canada fell by varying amounts up to 3 jiao. When prices opened, near-term contracts caused concern, and prices were generally weak, falling by 2-3 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. However, after the second session, the market situation turned tight again. As the end of the month approached, various manufacturers had to cover their chips, especially the short positions for this month. Therefore, confidence gradually strengthened, and opening prices were similar to the previous day. Although trading in the afternoon session was not particularly brisk for all months, the fact that new chips were not being sold off and old chips were being bought up gradually from outside the industry meant that although actual trading was not brisk, sentiment was universally good. The March contract was already being auctioned, opening at 4 jiao 6 fen, and then gradually rose. As a result, this month's contract rose by 2.5 li, the November contract rose by 2 fen, the December contract rose by 1.25 fen, the January-February contract rose by 1 fen, and the March contract rose by 3.25 fen from the initial opening price.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Follow Flour Market Recovery in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for all months generally showed a weak trend. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago fell by 5.5-6 jiao, Canada fell by varying amounts up to 1.2 jiao. Therefore, when prices opened, the opening prices for all months were generally weak. Near-term months fell by about 4-5 fen compared to the previous day, while distant months fell by slightly varying amounts up to 1-2 fen. However, as delivery for this month was also required and there was trade both inside and outside the industry, but trading was not brisk, the market did not show any particular liveliness. However, when the flour market recovered and strengthened in the afternoon session, opening prices for all contracts also rose slightly. However, because manufacturers were unwilling to pay high prices for spot wheat, a standard situation was difficult to achieve. As a result, the October and November contracts fell by a slight 1 fen, the December and January contracts remained unchanged, and the February contract rose by 2 fen. Spot wheat was being shunned by various manufacturers, and no delivery was seen.</p>
<p>According to reports from Argentina, severe frost has caused crop damage, with concerns of wheat rotting. However, this news was insufficient to prompt any widespread support, and market prices fell due to profit-taking by bulls and limit-down selling. Chicago wheat closing prices on October 29 and October 6:</p>
<p>October 29 closing  October 6 closing  Change</p>
<p>December　　　　　　 98.00　　　 96.25　　　Down 1.75</p>

<h3>Little Change in River Rice Market</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, about 50 or so gangs arrived in Shanghai (totaling over 7,000 shi of goods). Kiln rice arrivals from Yuanji Wang were steady, but sales were weak, causing sellers to be unwilling to push prices up strongly and gradually lowering them, leading to a decline in the market. However, at this time, the customer gangs were actively seizing the opportunity to buy, and sales seemed to be more active. As a result, it is estimated that the Qingdao and Yantai gangs took in 800-plus bags of six types of kiln rice, with prices falling by half a jiao or a full jiao. As for the remaining wild rice, white rice, and other thick new japonica rice, due to loose store sales, the market was sluggish and prices fell by 1-2 jiao. Du Yang Tip rice was also inevitably somewhat soft. Broken rice and Bian Yuan were re-priced, and Yin Yuan fell by several fen.</p>
<p>(Liubei) Yesterday, 24-25 ships of goods arrived from various ports along the river, and there were over 100 warehouses. On the market, all kinds of broken japonica rice and new japonica rice sales turned weak. Chen Bai Yuan, Yin Yuan kiln rice, new Du Tip rice, new Chen Bu Tip rice were still good. New Yang Tip rice had scarce arrivals and active sales. The market saw broken japonica rice prices fall by a small number of fen, high-quality new japonica rice fall by several fen, and mid-grade new japonica rice fall by a small jiao. Chen Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan rice were slightly tightly quoted. Kiln rice and new Du Tip rice were weak. New Yang Bu Tip rice prices increased by nearly a jiao, and Chen Bu Tip rice increased by 1-2 jiao. Ke Tip rice remained stable.</p>
<h3>New Pootung Soybeans Sell Weakly, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new Pootung soybeans sold weakly due to sluggish sales, with prices opening at 4 yuan 8 jiao, down 2.5 jiao compared to the previous market. Over 30 bags were traded, with source arrivals still scarce. The main reason for the decline was that other types of new beans were performing increasingly poorly, dragging down the market. The Chongming New Sand Yellow market also fell by a small jiao, with prices opening at 3 yuan 4.5 jiao to 3 yuan 3 jiao. Over 100 bags were traded. White sesame seeds, because foreign firms have moved their purchases to Hankou, have recently been slightly softer. Sales to other gangs were also weak. Yesterday, total market trading was over 500 bags of various sesame seeds, and prices also fell.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>British Government Reduces Import Tax on Chinese Silk</p>
<p>Britain has always been a country that consumes Chinese silk, but the British government imposes heavy import taxes on raw silk from China, Japan, France, Italy, and other countries. According to reliable information from Jardine Matheson and Tait &amp; Co., British firms in this port (engaged in the export of Chinese silk), the British government has approved that Chinese raw silk imported into Britain will receive the same reduced tax rate as French raw silk. Raw silk that has not been bleached will be subject to an import tax of one shilling and sixpence per pound, and raw silk that has been wholly or partially bleached will be subject to two shillings and twopence. This new tax rate has been in effect since July 1, and as a result, the shipment of Chinese silk to Britain has gradually increased in the past two months.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Hankou Foreign Firms Continue to Trade</p>
<p>White tung oil is in the transition between old and new crops, and foreign firms in Hankou are continuing to trade. The source is becoming increasingly scarce, resulting in demand exceeding supply. According to a report from the previous day, an American foreign firm purchased 60 tons, with prices calculated at 30 yuan 4 jiao per dan. Although samples of the new crop have been seen in the producing areas, the quantity is still small and cannot yet reach Hankou. Therefore, the quantity that can be supplied to foreign firms in Hankou is very limited. Recently, Hankou firms have increased their prices for goods ordered by customers to 25 yuan 5-6 jiao per dan for Xiang Tung, with only 500-600 dan available. If foreign firms continue to make deliveries, prices may have to be increased again. The lack of new crop arrivals from Xiao is a temporary situation. However, it is heard that futures are being sold off in various producing areas. In the Changde area, 10,000 dan have been sold off for delivery from November to January, and other areas are also likely to follow suit. If too many futures are sold off, it is foreseeable that the new crop may be difficult to fall in price. New crops have also been seen in various producing areas in Zhejiang Province. Several dozen dan have arrived in the Hangzhou market, and 10-20 dan of spot oil have been sold at 25 yuan 1 jiao per dan. Based on this, spot oil is unable to be sold cheaply for a while due to the small quantity. When more supplies arrive later, cheaper prices will naturally be available.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Galvanized Sheet Trading Gradually Activates</p>
<p>The galvanized sheet market has been quiet for a long time, but trading has recently gradually activated, so the market situation is not as stagnant as before. Battery factories, printing factories, publishing houses, and arsenals are all making inquiries, so the orders are quite large. Except for the No. 2 pattern used for lining tea chests, which has a relatively sluggish market, all other patterns are showing signs of prosperity, and prices are slightly better than before.</p>
<h3>Barbed Wire in Short Supply, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, gangs from Sichuan and Hankou have been buying up barbed wire in large quantities, resulting in very few goods being available on the market. Due to the extreme shortage of spot goods, the standard price has continued to rise. The current market price is 4 yuan 6 jiao, up another 2 jiao from before. However, the recent contraction of foreign exchange is not sustainable, and the market has the potential to rise further.</p>
<h3>Not Many Deformed Steel Bars Arriving</h3>
<p>Not many deformed steel bars are arriving, and the market sometimes experiences shortages of various patterns. The market price rose to 130 yuan yesterday, up another 5 yuan from before. Trading is very active, especially among construction gangs. Customer routes, such as the Qingdao and Fujian gangs, are also involved, so the market price is still solid.</p>

<h3>On Criticism Again</h3>
<p>— Yang Zao</p>
<p>What Chinese literati used to do was to find phrases and pick out words, focusing on trivial matters. Apart from that, they either looked down on each other or praised each other. So-called criticism was practically nonexistent; if it did exist, it was either scolding or flattering.</p>
<p>Criticism that could be considered genuine probably only emerged after the opening of China’s doors by the British, when goods flooded in. "Collected Works from the Ice-Drinker's Studio" should be regarded as one of the representatives.</p>
<p>Perhaps precisely because it arrived with that "thing," criticism has always had a commercial flavor since its inception. Scold you, and my value increases; praise you, and we both ascend to high positions. Because only literati can write, the trick is still specialized. Besides the old habits of looking down on each other and praising each other, a bit of the stench of money is added.</p>
<p>Anatole France once said, "I have never read a piece of criticism about myself, because I don't think it's necessary." Ignoring any abuse, ridicule, sarcasm, or genuine criticism seems to be generally regarded as the noble attitude of a gentleman who respects himself. France had his reasons for saying that, at a time when creation and criticism had become widespread commodities.</p>
<p>But there are also some self-proclaimed masters who are actually empty inside. Once their paper tiger is exposed by others, they immediately become furious, talking about "circles," "mandarinism," and "disgusting," stopping just short of cursing his mother, and finally declaring "eternal non-interaction," implementing a closed-door economy to protect domestic products and resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>Thus, critics should "die without a burial place."</p>
<p>In fact, even in this commodity-driven world, all criticism, as long as it is public, is tainted with some odor, but there are some that are definitely not commodities. There is indeed a kind of criticism that, in a Quixotic way, wants to examine, re-evaluate, critique, and discard all the prejudices, habits, customs, and systems that trap humanity in a quagmire, and to point out a broad road for those trapped to reach the other shore together. The ability of this kind of criticism to arise and develop mainly depends on starting with criticizing oneself.</p>
<p>And what many people cannot stand is precisely this kind of criticism, because they are sitting in the trap and cannot see the trap, and think it is very comfortable inside.</p>
<p>Criticism is too little in China, especially self-criticism.</p>
<h3>A Twenty-Five History</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In 1927, I worked at the Zhejiang Provincial Library. At that time, the books from Wang Kemin's house were confiscated as enemy property and were all kept by the Provincial Library. The library sent people to count the books, and a certain division commander stationed at the Wang family's ancestral hall wanted to keep a copy of the Twenty-Four Histories. Mr. Shan Bu'an allowed him to choose either the palace edition or the standard edition, but he chose the standard edition. We laughed secretly, thinking that military men were ultimately short-sighted. But later, I realized that decorating a study room and making it look grand and rich, of course, the standard edition was inferior to the palace edition; but practically speaking, the palace edition was really not as good as the standard edition. The military man had his own selection criteria. Over the years, after spending some time delving into the history books, I felt even more that the view of the division commander was correct. If the Twenty-Four Histories do not become a desktop reference, they are of no real use other than as decorations. The Kaiming edition of the Twenty-Five Histories is more socially significant than the photolithographic reprint of the Bai Nao edition of the Twenty-Four Histories.</p>
<p>From the perspective of history itself, the more historical materials are collected, the better. In the nineteenth century, German historians devoted themselves to large-scale compilations of historical materials. The debate on Chinese social history did not reach a mature conclusion, mainly because of the lack of historical materials. There is also a kind of childishness in the historical community, which is to make broad, boundless formulas and historical theories, and is unwilling to patiently do the work of arranging historical materials (cataloging and indexing). "What is a Seventeen History?" That sarcastic remark has become an excuse for historians, as if a Twenty-Five History is even more impossible to discuss, and it doesn't matter if it is simplified. With the progress of modern historical methods, indexing and cataloging have extremely simple methods, and it is not difficult to manage a Twenty-Five History. If there were such a small group that, following the example of previous people in compiling the Jing Ce Tong Zuan, completely disassembled, rearranged, and recompiled the Twenty-Five Histories, the Continuation of Zizhi Tongjian, the Nine Compilations, and other historical books, Chinese historiography would surely open up a new world. I have once drafted a design for the reorganization, tentatively named "Comprehensive Chronicle of Chinese Culture," with the following items:</p>
<p>Along with this Comprehensive Chronicle, three major dictionaries can be compiled: A. A Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Culture; B. A Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Academic Thought; C. A Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Literature. Logically, several new histories can be produced: A. A General History of China; B. A Cultural History of China; C. A History of Chinese Academic Thought; D. A History of Chinese Literature; E. A Social History of China. These new histories compiled from direct materials may avoid the old problem of imaginative construction. Expanding further, there are of course dozens of small histories that can be gradually compiled.</p>
<p>Looking at the precedent of Sima Guang compiling the Zizhi Tongjian (from the second year of Zhiping under Emperor Yingzong of Song to the seventh year of Yuanfeng under Emperor Shenzong of Song, it took a total of nineteen years; Wen Gong himself summarized its great achievements; the Former and Later Han Dynasties were mainly compiled by Liu Gongwen; from the Three Kingdoms to the Sui Dynasty, it was mainly compiled by Liu Daoyuan; from the Tang Dynasty to the Five Dynasties, it was mainly compiled by Fan Chunfu; and many other officials and subordinates helped.), the compilation of this Comprehensive Chronicle of Chinese Culture would require at least thirty to fifty people to do the work, and would take at least thirty to fifty years. To some impatient or complacent people, it may seem foolish. But we either do not hope that Chinese historiography will achieve anything, or else the first thing to do with a Twenty-Five History is to make it coherent and orderly.</p>

<h3>The Birth of My Son</h3>
<p>— Hui Ying</p>
<p>Stepping into the hospital gate, I felt a burst of intense throbbing in my heart. The reason was very simple, just for that one thing...</p>
<p>"I wonder how she is?"</p>
<p>Walking to the elevator door, I pressed the bell urgently. I was eager to go upstairs and see what was going on.</p>
<p>The door opened, and the white-coated attendant looked at this disheveled visitor and asked with a straight chest...</p>
<p>"Which floor?"</p>
<p>"Third floor."</p>
<p>"The third floor cannot be taken."</p>
<p>I didn't ask him the reason, nor did I argue with him, because it would only waste time. Anyway, this was not a regulation set by the hospital, but rather because my attire could not impress people.</p>
<p>Using my two legs, which had shared my hardships and never left me, I went up to the third floor.</p>
<p>My heart was throbbing even more fiercely.</p>
<p>Following the number that the nurse told me yesterday, I found the room.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a burst of infant crying, which then stopped abruptly. From the open door beside me, I saw that the room was fitted with seven or eight small, exquisite beds. The crying came from that room.</p>
<p>"Is my child in that room too?"</p>
<p>Thinking this, I approached the room I was looking for. The nurse I had seen yesterday happened to come out of the room and smiled at me when she saw me.</p>
<p>I guessed that the news she would tell me would be peaceful rather than unfortunate, and the throbbing in my heart immediately stopped.</p>
<p>"Mr. X, congratulations, you have a younger brother."</p>
<p>The child was born, but how was the child's mother? Why didn't she mention the mother first? Impatient, I asked her...</p>
<p>"How is the mother?"</p>
<p>"The mother is also fine. The child is very rare, weighing a full nine pounds and having a big head."</p>
<p>She said happily, as if this child had been born to her. As for me, the father, I didn't have that kind of joy, but my footsteps unconsciously followed her into the room where the child was staying.</p>
<p>Following her instructions, I saw the child on the second small bed next to the door. The child's right hand had a round piece of paper tied to it, with delicate penmanship...</p>
<p>"Bed 6X Younger Brother."</p>
<p>This was my son. My son - was born.</p>
<p>At the same time, my past events were evoked, and I wanted to silently tell him in front of the child...</p>
<p>"Child, do you know how difficult your birth was? Your father and mother, because we couldn't afford to raise you, once wanted to abort you. Thank goodness the doctor's asking price was too high, which saved your life. It is not easy for you to have a life in this world."</p>
<p>My son was born, and I became a father. The burden of life has increased, and the responsibility - has also increased. Under the leadership of Hitler, who is committed to promoting the spirit of the Great Germanic nation, giving birth to a child should have been a matter of pride and joy. However, I, as a father, believe that giving birth to a child is just another layer of burden.</p>
<p>Following the nurse into the room where the child's mother was staying, I saw the old and tired state of this new mother. She smiled and said as if comforted...</p>
<p>"Fortunately, we finally got through the gate of death."</p>
<p>I nodded to her and shook her hand. Having become a mother, she really began to care about her child. She asked me...</p>
<p>"Did you see the child? Is he okay?"</p>
<p>Releasing her hand, I said in a low voice...</p>
<p>"I saw him, the child is fine, he's sleeping. But we are no longer children."</p>

<h3>Small Square (Three)</h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>"This couplet is well written, it's just like the gold characters on a horizontal plaque. Only this makes me happy!"</p>
<p>So he laughed and went out, his face flushed, as if the few characters I had written a little better had guaranteed my wealth and fame in the future.</p>
<p>He told this to this person, told that to that person. No matter who he saw, he boasted. He said that my future was truly extraordinary, and that I would definitely get an official position. He said that in the Qing Dynasty, people who wrote well were sure to be champions in the imperial examinations, or at least selected as members of the Hanlin Academy, and that the situation was probably still similar now. Not to mention adults, even when he met children, when he was happy, my father would also speak loudly in a shrill voice...</p>
<p>"...Hmph, he is younger than you, but his skills are several times higher than yours. You are really not qualified even to hand him brushes and inkstones or empty his chamber pot... Haha..."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, for some reason, I not only didn't feel happy, but instead my skin crawled and my whole body felt uncomfortable, as if I had taken a medicine that wasn't very effective. It wasn't shyness, or fear of being ridiculed by anyone, but really just a kind of revulsion towards my father, a kind of emotion that was almost close to contempt and hatred.</p>
<p>Like antique dealers running to antique shops, my father was also busy going in and out of the homes of wealthy gentlemen before the New Year. Because poor people would naturally respectfully send the small square couplets to their door, while the wealthy gentlemen would sit there waiting for you.</p>
<p>My father had managed to get almost all of the small square couplets in the homes of the wealthy gentlemen, except for those in Mr. Zhang's house - which was naturally a regrettable matter for my father. He was the only large household in our village, with several thousand acres of land, dozens of houses, and wives, concubines, children, and grandchildren crowding the house. None of the poor people in the vicinity were not his tenants, and the number was so large that they could form several teams when sending rent. He himself was a recommended scholar, and several of his sons were all university students, and even his grandsons were studying in middle schools and elementary schools. His prestige was really frightening. Every magistrate who took office had to go to the countryside to pay him a visit, which further increased his reputation.</p>
<p>He didn't send small square couplets for me to write because there were many people in his own family who were literate and didn't need to ask others. Although those young masters had read books, they were all used to comfort and no one was willing to tremble in the cold weather to write.</p>
<p>The reason was that the small square couplets in his house were all already painted, with gold characters on a red background, very dazzling, and would not peel off even after many years of wind and rain. From a distance, you could see the year-round couplet above the black lacquer gate shining brightly. The aura was overwhelming. The characters on those couplets were all written by famous masters, so they were even more precious.</p>
<p>"Hmph, if you could write the small square couplets for Mr. Zhang's house, Xiao Ru!..."</p>
<p>My father often bent his fingers, picked his nose, and said with a regretful sigh.</p>
<p>"It's really amazing. If that kind of wealthy family... I heard that a great calligrapher sent a couplet to Mr. Zhang, wanting to ask for some favors, but he didn't even pay attention to him... Xiao Ru, work hard... Practice your writing for another ten years and see..."</p>
<p>Because of this matter, my father often talked to my mother, boasting to her about Mr. Zhang's prestige, saying that as long as I was qualified to write small square couplets for him, I would never have to worry about not having a chance to stand out in the future.</p>
<p>This was my father's biggest fantasy. He kept Mr. Zhang in his mind, and he never forgot the small square couplets in Mr. Zhang's house, even in his dreams.</p>
<p>The opportunity finally came.</p>

<h3>Woman Rapes Man</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held a meeting the other day to deliberate on the chapter on crimes against public morals. The vehemence of the debate among the committee members was unprecedented. Indeed, matters of public morals are not only interesting to discuss, but also occur more frequently in society than other types of cases.</p>
<p>The opinions expressed by the committee members were divided into four points: (1) Should the object of rape be changed from women to men and women? (2) Should the severity of punishment for rape be increased? (3) Should the age for defiling young girls be changed from fourteen to sixteen? (4) Should gang rape offenders be treated according to the current law? Regarding items (2), (3), and (4), apart from item (3) conveniently benefiting generations of sex maniacs and saving many</p>
<p>troublesome rape cases, there were no other opinions. However, I strongly agree with changing the phrase to "men and women" or "opposite sex," so why was it rejected in the end?</p>
<p>One committee member said that a man illegally defiling a woman is rape, and a woman illegally defiling a man is also rape. The phrase "women" in the first item should be changed to "men and women" to show equality. At first hearing, isn't this a big joke? Only the Country of Women in *Flowers in the Mirror* has such a strange phenomenon. There has only ever been a man raping a woman, and never heard of a woman raping a man. This matter is not only unprecedented, but also factually impossible. In fact, this view is outdated and does not deeply examine the current social situation.</p>
<p>Things in the world often go beyond what is rationally impossible but emotionally possible. Furthermore, the demand for sexual desire does not differentiate between men and women. The idea that only sex maniacal men pursue women and not sex maniacal women pursue men is a biased view. In the past, due to the constraints of old ethics, only men were allowed to be unrestrained, while women were not. Therefore, a "fair maiden" was only for a "gentleman to pursue." I ask, is the current world the same as the past? Will the future world be the same as the present?</p>
<p>Taking the facts into account, a woman named Xie in Shanghai once raped an underage Italian boy. When Mei Lanfang was young and performing in Beijing, he was once forcibly kissed by a young lady after leaving the stage. Although the crime of rape was not established in this case, the crime of attempted rape was. At that time, although the old ethics had been broken, they were not completely broken. This kind of phenomenon had already occurred. Now, there are many examples of sexually maniacal women performing nakedly. Who says that only men can rape women, and not women rape men? Based on the current situation, perhaps it can no longer be taken as a definitive conclusion?</p>
<p>The Kingly Way is none other than human sentiment, and legislation especially values facts. If the phrase "women" is not changed to "men and women" or "opposite sex," what if the same thing happens again? If it is said that it is not a crime, it violates the principle of equality in the law. If it is said that it is a crime, there is no legal basis. How should the judge handle it? Furthermore, the effect of law is to restrain the future, not to retroactively punish the past. Therefore, this clause should be included in the criminal law, and it is practically indispensable in terms of reason and emotion.</p>
<h3>Occasional Musings from a Study</h3>
<p>— Philosopher</p>
<p>(2) Black Singer</p>
<p>I have always held a contemptuous attitude towards jazz music. No matter how lively the melody or how brilliant the appearance, I always feel that it lacks some of the essence of art. Early jazz had some bright meaning, suitable for the spirit of urbanism, and could sometimes convey some light sorrow, some lingering emotions of love songs. But as it has evolved to the present, this once-popular music has become devoid of any content, leaving only a jumble of chaotic rhythms and noise. That primitive</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Black music has actually swept through the emerging American nation, and is welcomed by the countries of Western Europe, the land of culture. Isn't that a perplexing thing? This suspicion lingered in my chest until one snowy winter evening last year, when I was in a good mood and sat in a club for five hours, watching a black singer perform, and only then did I find an explanation.</p>
<p>That black singer, like all black people, had a dull and expressionless face, foolish lips, and slow, lackluster, and clumsy eyes. He stood there, lowered his head, lowered his eyelids, moved slowly on the floor, and following the lively and stimulating saxophone, a low voice leaked out of his lips. While singing, he did not shake his arms, did not shake his body, like a white jazz singer, he just lowered his head, looked at the floor, as if pondering something, spitting out a tune that contained heavy fatigue and sorrow. I heard a black soul praying to God there. This is not bright jazz. Contained within the lively form is the desperate cry of the nearly extinguished Negro nation, a high, fateful, national sorrow. This black singer used slow movements and low tones to match the bright melody, deeply moving the audience. Only then did I suddenly realize the true face of black music. That direct and rapid power to move!</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this direct and rapid power to move that the American nation has isolated the form of black music from the painful national sorrow, and it has become popular jazz music. But what a cheap commodity jazz music is.</p>
<p>Here, I got some small feelings. The content and form of art are an inseparable, organic synthesis. With that concept in mind, and then looking at the slogan of literary heritage recently proposed by a group of people in the literary world who aspire to climb the ladder of success, and their views, how ridiculous will they appear before us! After accepting the legacy in their way, literary works will also become something like white jazz music, like current essays, or rather, miscellaneous articles.</p>
<h3>Old Tongbao and His Grandson</h3>
<h3>Investigating the Population</h3>
<p>— Ruomu</p>
<p>The Han River always flows turbulently and vigorously. The branches of the dense silk trees are buzzing with flocks of sparrows. At this time, K Town, which dominates the lower reaches of the Han River, suddenly issued a burst of bugle wails, which was the order to summon the population investigation preparations. In the past few years, K Town could be said to be a paradise, a fairyland. But now it is not as good as before. Due to the fluctuations of the world panic, the residents here also made a suspicion of communicating with bandits at the beginning of this year, and received the attention of the authorities. Thus, K Town, like other villages and towns, was to undergo a strict household registration inspection - a military household registration inspection.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the population investigation in K Town. The residents of the whole town gathered in the square following the shouts of each person. The X Battalion Commander, the special commissioner for the population investigation, also appeared leisurely following the cessation of the bugle sounds. He had a full set of beautiful military uniforms, two Brownings hanging from his waist. His face was full of majesty, forming a well-proportioned outline. What was special was that he had a pair of sharp eyes, which, when they swept across everyone's faces, seemed to have the power of an electric current, turning everyone's faces pale.</p>
<p>Mr. Mou, the head of the township, walked towards Battalion Commander X tremblingly, holding a thin household registration book. Of course, Battalion Commander X was here with a mission from his superiors, and he did not need to be polite to Mr. Mou - and there was no need to be polite. So he unceremoniously and silently took the household registration book from Mr. Mou's hand and began his investigation work.</p>
<p>People's names were chanted one by one from Battalion Commander X's mouth as time passed rapidly. This was probably the last one. When Li Datou Gongsun walked past Battalion Commander X, closely following the last person chanted by Battalion Commander X, Battalion Commander X's sharp eyes widened and paid attention to him. "Suspect, his name is not on the roster! Arrest him, he should be shot immediately!"</p>
<p>The people in the entire square were already frightened by Battalion Commander X's shout. Mr. Mou's face turned pale. The arrested suspect, Li Datou Gongsun, stood like a wooden puppet, raising a pair of eyes full of tears, begging Mr. Mou, the head of the township.</p>
<p>At this time, it was a dangerous scene of Li Datou's life-and-death crisis. Although Mr. Mou, the head of the township, was frightened and at a loss, he had to righteously clear Li Datou Gongsun of his unjust accusation. So Mr. Mou clutched his own scalp and pleaded with Battalion Commander X. He said that Li Datou Gongsun was doing small business here, they were from out of town, and could not be filled into the household registration book of this township. He could guarantee him, guarantee that he was not a bandit. However, Battalion Commander X became suspicious of Mr. Mou because Mr. Chen had tried too hard for Li Datou Gongsun. He thought that Mr. Mou was also a suspect in harboring bandits and should be arrested. So Mr. Mou became a victim of suspicion and was locked in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Revelation at the End of Winter</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>Autumn, deep, deep, quietly, quietly, is about to leave this human garden and disappear.</p>
<p>The wind, whistling, whistling, towards this earth, towards this dense forest, towards this clear stream, towards this continuous mountain range, the aging, dry leaves are falling, flying, the clear stream? Those ripples on the water's surface are constantly chasing, disappearing!</p>
<p>On the road surface, there also seems to be some noticeable difference. It no longer flows with sweat and oil like in summer, nor does it have a layer of lush vitality like in early autumn. Now, it is just very quiet, solemn, holding a full cavity of sorrow!</p>
<p>The shops are always occupying the "first voice" of the "time." The previous shop signs have changed. Gray rats, fox legs, ginseng, and bird's nests have become the leading vanguard of the season. ... All of this is transforming. No, there are also things that do not change. That is the flow of the crowd on the street!</p>
<p>Young men and women are slowly walking on the bustling road.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>walking, watching, naturally wearing thick coats, otherwise, that would be afraid of hurting the dignity of the body. Here, the collar of the coat moves up and down in unison with the same pace. Naturally, the sound that bursts out from under the shiny leather shoes is very pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>Red lips, high nose, a pair of agile eyes, when smiling, the white and neat teeth revealed from the curved lips, that should be how attractive demeanor!</p>
<p>——It's cold, you really have to wear a winter coat." The woman said, her eyes fixed on the man's face.</p>
<p>——Really, I forgot again. Let's make one at XX Company, shall we? He smiled and glanced at her.</p>
<p>She pulled the arm clasped in his arm tighter, and did not say anything more. The young red light projected onto their bodies, bathing their faces in a kind of bright halo.</p>
<p>However, in a secluded corner of the road, there is a miserable cry. Squeezing in, the ground is written with such a piece of white ——</p>
<p>... Hometown Yanji, unable to withstand the bandit disaster, fled together, begging along the way, and arrived in Shanghai. Because they were unable to meet relatives, they were stranded in another country. The land is barren and the people are strangers. There is no way to appeal. They have tightened their belts and endured hunger for two days. They only hope that people of benevolence and gentlemen from all walks of life ...</p>
<p>Many people are surrounding them, copper coins are scattered on the ground, some people are sighing, some people are holding mysterious smiles, and some people are staring at the drooping-headed young woman. Hmph, look, this is a microcosm of the human feelings in the metropolis!</p>
<p>The goose-yellow curtains are lowered, and the light from the cotton gauze lampshade emits a delicate brilliance. The radio is crisply reporting ——</p>
<p>... It's getting cold, please use XX to wipe your face, which can make your skin very delicate, ... newly arrived foreign coats. The colors are very modern, and the materials are very strong, only selling X yuan X yuan a yard. During the bargain period, you can also get a 10% discount ...</p>
<p>Large packages and small packages are being sent out of the store doors, all heading towards different roads with different expressions. However, the crowd in this metropolis is still flowing.</p>
<p>Autumn, deep, deep, quietly, gone. What is coming is the bleak, sad, "winter" revelation!</p>
<h3>East, West, South, North</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>People die for wealth, birds die for food. Poor people are indeed turning around in the eyes of money, but what are the rich people busy with?</p>
<p>There is even a Changshu Yan Zhou family born for money. The common name is "Money-Guarding Boy." Although this person is an 81-year-old woman, she is worthy of the name.</p>
<p>According to reports, three months after the woman's marriage, her husband died prematurely. She used the insufficient inheritance to save and generate interest, and now it has reached more than 500,000, so that the lawyers in Changshu shake their heads when they see her. There is no doubt about the high level of her wealth accumulation skills.</p>
<p>It is also a natural law that rich people are stingy. Yan Zhou eats a bowl of fried rice noodles and two fried bread sticks a day. She is not enjoying her blessings, so what can bystanders criticize? However, in addition to saving money, she must always guard against theft in fear and unease, so that the location of the contracts and passbooks is moved several times a night. At the sound of wind and rain, she becomes uneasy, which shows the woman's "petty style." - 500,000 in Shanghai is still a basic person!</p>
<p>Then I want to ask ... is money omnipotent, or is it all evil?</p>

<p>The clear moon hangs in the sky, revealing blue clouds. The Milky Way spills its shadow, clean and dust-free. Flower shadows cover the ground, early and late. Zhang Sheng hides beside the Taihu stone. Quietly and lonely, the sound is silent. Secretly and flickeringly waiting for Yingying. Suddenly hearing the sound of the corner door creaking. Pendants jingle, the sound of gold and jade. Under the moon and flowers, she sees a beautiful woman. An incense table is arranged under the flowers and moon. Miss burns incense in the sandalwood furnace. First, she wishes her father to ascend to heaven. Second, she wishes her mother in the main hall long life. Chang Xu bows down silently. Secretly listening to the beauty's feelings. Quickly sighing unable to understand. Dragon thin mist. Green covers the clouds. Mistaking her for Zhuo Wenjun across the wall. The talented man recites a poem. Yingying harmonizes with a fresher rhythm. Wanting to pass the flower wall to understand. The person goes, the curtain is already closed. The blue platform is cold with dew, still the old road. From then on, longing and sleepless nights. Still lonely facing the lonely lamp.</p>
