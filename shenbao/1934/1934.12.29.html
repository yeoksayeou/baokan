<p>廢除區公所改稱區署　擴大組織並增加經費</p>
<p>爲恊助縣長深入民間推行政令之機關</p>
<p>（南昌）　蔣委員長南昌行營、頃訓令各勦匪省份、令飭各縣改設區制、並製定分區設署辦法大綱、及區署編制經費表、令卽施行、茲將分區設署辦法原文、錄誌如下、</p>
<p>改革舊制原因、爲訓令事、查縣爲行政單位、自中央逮省之一切政令、悉由此下達於民衆、而我國各縣之幅員、大者三四百里、小者亦百餘里、民衆多者五六十萬、少者亦達十餘萬、在昔滿清之世、縣以下尚多設縣丞巡檢分司等職、勉資佐治、然今之縣制、所以治理此廣土衆民者、僅恃一端拱縣城之縣長而已、依現行縣組織法、縣以下之各鄉、原定分劃爲若干區、各設區公所、以爲地方自治機關、然組織旣不健全、人選亦甚濫雜、經費則、尤形短絀、地方民衆之視區長、無異昔日之團董莊頭、絕不特加尊重、於是地方士民之賢良者、多趦趄引避、不肖者則奔競而進、結果各地區長、大都爲貪污土劣所把持、助行政令則不足、壓迫民衆則有餘、故縣長與民衆之間、旣無居間聯繫之樞紐、自失指臂相使之效用、以致一切政令、逮縣之後、卽等於具文、無法推進、訓政數年、迄未能樹立憲政之基礎、職此之由、本委員長前年曾於豫鄂皖三省勦匪總部、頒行區公所組織條例、並於頒發該條例訓令文中、詳述過去區制之失當、及是後改善工作之方針、先就剿匪各省、試行改革、兩年以來、於編查保甲戸口、徵集壯丁團隊諸項自衛要政、頗著相當成績、惟以區長人選、尚屬取材當地、區制規模亦未充實、以之積極輔助縣政之發展、仍感不足、爰更詳察地方之情形、周諮各省行政長官之意見、認定澈底改善區制、分區設署、實爲目前之要圖、茲特制定剿匪省份各縣、分區設署辦法大綱、並附訂甲乙丙三種區署編制經費表、公布施行、以爲縣政確立下層之基幹、</p>
<p>區制性質權力　區制之性質權力、均予根本改造、撮其要義、約有四端、一則改正其名稱、凡舊時區公所、或區辦事處、一律取消、不復沿用、而改稱爲（區署）、藉以表明此後區署乃爲官治之行政機關、絕非向日之自治組織、以矯正往昔區制之觀念、今後之地方下級自治、應在市鄉行之、於市鄉上之區無與焉、二則擴大其組織、增加其經費、區長之下酌設區員、書記等職、輔以員司、且皆酌給適合鄉村生活之薪俸、俾能贍家以養廉、三則提高區長區員之地位、以有縣長資格者、乃許充任區長、並須迥避本籍、以有相當學識經騐者、乃許充任區員、而區長區員皆加以一定期間之訓練、藉以充實其治事之能力、且更保障其任期、確定其出路、凡區長區員任職、著有成效者、得分别以縣長區長任用存記、旣足鼓勵其前程之努力、更可儲備確有實地經騐之縣長人選、四則明定其職掌、所有區中保衛安寗、調查戸口、訓練民衆、指導合作、推行敎育、清丈土地、實施工役、以及一切農村水利等建設工作、曁區内衛生公安交通經濟財務之一切縣政、凡與管敎養衛有關者、統由區長秉承縣長之命、負責執行、其辦理是否得當、有無成績、則規定由縣長隨時分區巡視考詢、以爲奬懲之資、是故今後之區署、卽成爲純粹恊助縣長深入民間推行政令之機關、實等於縣政府之支部、系統分明、權責加重、益以完備其組織、愼重其人選、則行政效能、自可隨之而增進、</p>
<p>區署經費來源　　顧有以分區設者、恐地方財力不勝爲慮者、謂往日區公所經費、每月最多者不過百餘元、少者僅數十元、尚不免於短欠、今擴大其組織、依編制表規定、甲種區每月經費多至三百九十一元、最小之丙種區、亦達二百六十三元、彼此相較、驟增數倍、則此項所增之經費、自應預籌其來源、須知事關要政、如各省當局、認明必須實行、則統顧兼籌、移緩就急、卽不患無凑補之餘地、茲舉例證之、第一、省政府現已合署辦公、縣政府亦復裁局改科、則兩項節餘、已有相當之成數、第二殘匪肅清後、地方團隊必須分别縮編、原有經費、亦自可略爲騰挪、第三、區公所旣已撤消、各縣原有之自治附加稅、更可移爲區署之用、第四、地方敎育及合作事業、旣規定由區署承辦、則省府原定之特種敎育補助費、及合作指導員經費、亦可一律移撥、第五、區署經費雖較區公所增多、然舊制各縣劃區之數、原由四區至十區、而本大綱劃區之規定、則由三區至六區爲止、並規定縣政府駐在地之區署、其區長區員、亦得由縣府職員兼充、是區數减少、則區費自能略增、如以上五項之抵補、仍感不足、自應由省府再籌補助、總之、分區設署、爲健全地方行政之重要步驟、亦卽厲行管敎養衛之樞紐所在、凡啟迪民衆、安定地方、促進建設、均將於此以致其成效、卽或財政稍有困難、亦當通盤籌劃、挹彼注茲、以謀本制之實施、不可因噎而廢食、仰各該省政府以及各縣政府、咸體此意、恪切遵行、分期改進、務依本大綱第二十二條之規定、於一年限期以内、在各省所屬各縣地方、辦理完成、</p>
<p>區署應辦事務　關於區署應辦之事務、如農林水利衛生築路合作、及清丈土地徵集工役等項、尤應由各該省政府主管廳處、根據學理、斟酌地方情形、擇其切於實用、而推行便利者、分别編製簡明之小册、分發各區署、加以指示、俾資遵循、除以本大綱函達行政院、轉呈國民政府察核、曁行知各主管部查照備案、並分行外、合亟檢同各縣分颧設署辦法大綱、曁附表一份、令仰該省政府、卽便遵照辦理、並轉飭所屬、一體遵照、仍仰將奉文日期及施行實情、具報備查、此令、附件隨發、</p>
<p>剿匪省份各縣分區設署辦法大綱第一條　南昌行營爲修正剿匪省份各縣區公所、或區辦公處之職掌名稱、並充實其組織、俾確能恊助縣長、增進縣政效率起見、特製定本大綱、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>提倡國貨與國貨敎育季·</h3>
<p>自民國十九年以來。吾國對外貿易入超。年達七八萬萬元左右。總計五年之間。流出金錢。已達三十七萬萬元有奇。漏巵如此之巨。正所以見國人購用洋貨之多。國貨銷路。當然被奪。究其結果。農工商各業。無不大受影響。形成今日極嚴重之經濟國難。生產日少。失業年增。人民膏血。趨於枯竭。國家命脈。瀕於動搖。前途危險。不堪言狀矣。故時至今。欲言救亡圖存。安定國民生計最有效之辦法。厥爲提倡國貨。蓋其作用。消極可减金錢外流。積極能促各業振與。洋貨之杜絕。生產之增進。失業之消除。元氣之灰復。無不有賴乎是。</p>
<p>上所論列。陳義嚗　極尋常。國人類能言之。惟對國貨之積極提倡。恐尚屬於近數年間事。數年以前。救國運動。大都偏重於一方。熱心入士。因受外侮剌激。一時心懷不平。義憤填胸。主對侵略我者。施以報復。注意力並不集中於普通之外貨。而外貨之入口。遂年有增加。金錢外溢。非特未嘗稍衰。且日見其甚。惟至近一兩年來。提倡國貨之聲浪日高。而提倡者所含意義。亦已漸見進步。皆知以挽救國民經濟爲主。是以去年先有人以國貨年之說相勗勉。今年又以婦女國貨年爲婦女界倡。最近滬上敎育工商各團體更進一步。聯合發起訂定明年爲兒童國貨年及學生國貨年。以資號召。此外若國貨商店之設立。國貨宣傳團體之組織。有似雨後春筍。方興未艾。際茲國家處於列强經濟侵略之下。人民生當憂患貧乏之秋。能對國貨作此種種倡導。自屬切要之圖。吾人未宜等閒視之也。</p>
<p>等吾人對於今後提倡國貨。尚有未能已於言者。卽今國人歡迎洋貨之心理。似正與日俱增。大有道高一尺魔高一丈之勢試問一般國人。對用外貨之爲得爲失。胸中已有澈底的衡量乎。能如歐美日各國之人民。亦以服用國貨爲榮。購買外貨爲恥乎。恐仍未能。吾曾徧察都市仕女。對於一切衣食住行。種種日用所需。皆非洋貨不足以饜奢慾。對於國貨。每嫌其不時髦而棄之。至於普通平民。則又皆以洋貨爲價廉物美。樂於購用。一般商人。又見其有利可圖。而盡力販運。假使全國上下。而仍如此。則縱國產貨品。日求精進。其銷路能駕舶來品而上之乎。</p>
<p>顧欲破除國人歡迎洋貨之心理其道自不一端惟有敎育方面尤應　　一般見童及青年。正當求學時代。處於被敎養之地位。雖有純潔本性。但乏自主能力。爲其父母假長者。苟能諄諄善誘。使其輕視洋貨。信仰國貨。造成深刻不可磨滅之觀念。蔚爲素樸至誠動人之風氣。其足挽回一般洋貨迷之心理。自不在少。然則明年之兒童學生國貨年。在諸家庭及學校敎師。所負使命。豈非特别重大乎。夫學校家庭。皆係集團生活。青年學子。本富愛國熱忱。父母偉師　而能身體力行。加意訓勉。自甚易於廣收宏效。故吾人逕視兒童學生國貨年爲國貨之敎育年可也。願卽從此以後。各家庭學校。咸能聞風興起。馨　禱之矣。</p>

饒馨逸、茲薈集其生平傑構、刋成雲外朱樓集二册、凡十餘萬言、由本埠霞飛路嵩山路東中孚書局發行、昨承見惠一部、特此誌謝、短篇小説大衣  朱　　在秋盡冬初的九十月間，簡實是我國人結婚的月份。逢到了舊歷歷本上的所謂黄道吉日，那些旅館，禮堂等門前，莫不高高地供列着結婚人家喜字的矗燈。有幾家大些旅館或禮堂、一日之間，同時竟有四五家人家舉行婚禮，眞是笙歌盈耳，喜幛滿目，充塞着一片洋洋喜氣。　　吳先生雖是一個交際不廣的人，然而旣在社會上做事，拿錢，當然不能不和外界接觸，於是一班友朋，有幾個僅是在茶寮中點點頭的，都辱承不窠，喜帖，訃聞，甚至追慶祖先的帖子，紛至沓來，眞使僅賺十餘元的吳先生，對着發來的帖子，深深地感到不勝負擔的痛苦。　　吳先生對於那班點頭朋友的應酬，爲着無力應付，祇好不够交情，槪不應酬；可是有幾處不是近親娶妻，定是好友嫁女，婚喪大事，當然不能不應酬，尤其是他妻子的小姊妹王家女兒出嫁。　　王家的夫人，是吳先生夫人唯一的知己，因着性情的投機，所以二人嫁後，兀是彼此往來。王家的家况，比了吳家是稍微好些，然而因王夫人出嫁得早，早已兒女成羣。王夫人的大女兒，今年已十八歲了，平日對於吳夫人（姨母姨母）的叫得怪親熱，所以吳夫人對於王小姐出嫁，認爲是本年份的一件大事。　　吳夫人自從知道了王小姐結婚的日期，就有得忙了。起初是籌備添房的禮物，後來又預備出禮的份洋；對於自己身上的衣裝，也着手添置起來。駱駝絨的旗袍，是短得不能穿了；那件灰鼠旗袍，也還是大前年做的，顏色旣不時髦，花樣也已老式，確非重換面子，不能再行上身。　　吳先生對於吳夫人那般横揀豎揀的選擇衣料，曾向他夫人進過勸解：這種出客衣裳，横豎難得穿着，好馬虎些就馬虎些罷！　　可是吳夫人有着大大的道理，伊不等吳先生說完，就侃侃地說道；（虧你說得出！我嫁得你這般好丈夫丨長袍短套，色色週全？難得做兩件吃喜酒衣裳，你難道還說得出叫我做得不稱心麽？）　　吳夫人的理由，確也十分充足；吳先生除了悶聲不語，委實無言可駁。好容易托了人在上海把衣料買來，雖然有一件衣料，還不稱吳夫人的心，然而旣是托人代買，東西不好，當然不能再吹毛求疵，不能馬虎的，也祇得馬虎了。衣料買好之後，又是喊成衣匠，裁料，合皮，忙忙碌碌，接着忙了三五天，總算把兩件旗袍做好。那時距離王家結婚的日子，也祇有三天了。　　吳先生對於着妻子的新裝，心中雖喜憂各半，然而總以爲可以太太平平吃一杯喜酒了。那知他這天冒着呼呼北風，回到家裏，他的妻却又迎着他，說出一件事來。（霞：我有一件事要和你商議。天是這般冷了，外面的女人，你看那一個不穿大衣？王家喜酒，我怎好坍　子，不穿大衣去應酬呢！）　　大衣，這眞使吳先生大吃一驚，雖然女子大衣的價值，現下祇舉三十元左右，然而在吳先生羅掘已窮的當兒，怎能再行負擔！　　吳夫人也明白吳先生的苦衷，婉轉解釋道：（霞。窮祇好窮在家裏，外面怎好坍台？現在要你做大衣，當然你力量不够！不過借却不可不出去一借，借得了最好，借不着祇好向　緞局去租借一件，台是終不能坍的·）　　吳先生的腦中，給（不穿大衣就坍台麽）的一句話，擾得昏昏的不知所云，然而他對於夫人。除了頻頻點頭，委實没有别的話可說了。</p>

<p>自由談菊池寛的魅惑  張香山　　丨丨日本作家扎記一丨丨　　在日本的作家裏、能够被衆人都熱戀地讀的作家、可以說是菊池寬了、他的作品下至於小學生上至於財閥政閥，没有個不熱誠地愛讀着的，其實在他二三十本的全集裏，除了時代的（歷史的）以外，以現代的故事爲題材的小說，可以說是有了特殊的著目的典型，而且同樣地將一個典型的人物，作成了相雷同的小說，但他的吸收讀者的狂熱，却一點也不曾失去，這無他，我可以稱之謂（菊池寬的魅惑）。　　在菊池寬的小說裏之女人，大約有三種典型，一種是現代女性，過分地崇拜西洋的物質文明，狂熱於物質生活的享受裏的，一種是封建的女性，還保持着日本舊有的封建的道德，一種是半封建半現代的女性，以封建的固有的思想，但煊染了現代的文化之雰圍，所以變成了一種最合適於現代日本的社會之女性。這三種女性，在菊池寬的小說裏，都展開來錯綜的戀愛故事，像（新女性鑑），（明眸禍），（再和我接個吻）等等的長篇裏，以這種典型的女性，作主人公、而尤其把菊池寬氏所理想的，而是合於現社會的半封建半現代的女性，常成了成功的人物。　　這種含有同種型的女性之出現於各小說裏，而仍握住讀者的情熱。我說過，這是由於他的魅惑，這魅惑是什麽呢，是（熱情）與（單純）。　　不論在文字間，在故事的主人公女性之一舉一動間，可以說都充滿了熱情，使讀者的血被勾動似在春天的花叢裏遇見戀人一樣。這種熱情，並不是色情狂的Ｅrotic的、而是自然的不猬蟄的，一種帶有藝術的薰香的熱情，這種熱情含在每個女性的細胞裏，無論是那一類型的女人，都持有他獨自的合於個性的熱情，也就靠了這熱情是握住了每個讀者的心。菊池寬尤其把他的理想着的半封建半現代的女性，成了戀愛上的成功者，並且成之爲現日本的最代表的賢女性；他貶那些耽於西洋文明的現代女，同時貶封建素質的舊女性；所以在現日本的半封建半資本主義的社會裏，菊池寬型的女人，配合了許多田讀者的愛好。不僅在女主公方面如是，在男主人公方面，也描成一多情的美男子，以戀愛爲至上的幸福，而鍾情於半封建半現代的女性者。這種男子，使之成了有微細的女人素質的充滿熱情的男子，因此被許多女人所鍾愛，所懷念。　　的確菊池寬的小說，除了這適合於衆讀者的愛好之熱情以外，那（單純）可以說是獲得許多讀者的最大原因。　　菊池寬的小說之塲面，舖得不大寬張，而尤其在形式上，是以極簡單，素朴的方法，使讀者能深切的理解。並且在文字上是極合乎一般人理解的程度而著作的，他不用極難的（漢字）更不以歐化的文句，作修飾，單純的，清麗的美漂在文字的行間，所以這種極易理解，極易懂的文字，使每個讀者能讀，不感到生澀，而反能感到單純的美。這種傾向現在很影響了日本的别的作家，像寳生犀星等都在文字的單純上找美，和求到使一般的讀者理解。　　不要把菊池寬看成了戀愛的多角主義者，他的確如實地反映了現日本的女性的姿態，他並不是以藝術的愛慾作手淫；而是個最純情的藝術至上者，他雖然忠實的反映了現日本的男女，可是給他的世界觀煊染得平凡，而看不到正當的明白的男女之戀愛。西貢的書灘  辛爾　　住在安南許多時候，總看不到安南色彩的文化影子；感到和安南眞太隔膜與生疎了！似乎就常常隠約的憧憬着：（安南喲，你的靈魂兒究竟在那裏！）雖然，身處在安南的懷抱裏；可是我老領嘗不着安南的眞情調。　　難道安南是死去了嗎？徘徊在西貢岸上，遥望着灣灣曲曲，像條睡着的蛇的西貢港兩旁上，青青的綠草，和熱帶上，特有風格的茅屋；回頭看看高巍的海關，和海關樓上就立着的高梧的白種人，令人更加懷着無限的嘆息！　　和安南商業最繁盛的堤岸混熟了，終是很難找出安南人的書店。有的，只是賣中國書的中國書店，和賣西洋書的白種人的書店。這些書店，又見不到安南人去買書的影兒。安南人能讀書的，少到這樣子嗎？難道他們都不讀書嗎？　　要想看到安南報紙更無從尋覓了。要看看安南的男的女的學生子，更始終是無緣。日常可能見到的是：拉車子的襤褸的粗人），和一些上市買物的滿口嚼着捲葉和檳榔的婦人而已。　　堤岸市内走得厭倦了，迎着黄昏時候的凉爽飄人的凉風，費了四角錢，坐在黄包車上，沿電車路直駛向西貢市内去。（乘電車只要一角錢）　　寬曠的柏油路眞是走不完，高大的洋樓商店數不盡；但終還是没有見到較新鮮的東西。　　慢慢的，拖着疲倦而輕軟的步調，走過一個林立着張篷而販的大市塲。燈火閃燦中，辯别出了是許多安南婦人在做着她們的生意。市塲内厞常熱閙，那是我從來没有看見過的；安南人聚集的地方呢！　　這是第一遭兒呵，發見了安南婦人在做主人的書灘，一連有好幾個，使我突然發生了極大的歡欣。忙擠進去看看，但盡所有書灘上的書，都是一些中國書，而且，奇怪的是：逃不出薛仁貴征東，征西，和平南，以至三國，七俠五義之類。盡是這些千篇一律的小說。此外再也翻不出其他的東西。　　這些書是安南婦人，賣給安南人看的啦！如此而已。我又不得不悵然離開。此後，便也就不嘗在和二處發見别樣的書攤。　　詢問老番客們，他們是這樣得意感臡的說。　　安南人本來都是認得中國字的，讀過中國書的。後來白種人來了，便漸漸的取消。不過，最初老輩人還要說，年青人不懂中國字，算是（白腹）。可是久了情形就全換過一番。　　現在，安南文化全絕滅了。唯有頂高貴的安南人，給他讀法文，一般能有力讀書的，法國人給他們（創造）了一種新文字，只要讀二個月便可應用；應用的範圍，只能記賬簿和寫幾句話的信而已。華僑叫做：（子谷禦）（譯音）　　這便是安南的文化了呵！　　西貢的書攤上所賣的征東征西，年青的安南人還不能認識；要那般老人們，尚記得起他們的（從前事）的老輩，才喜歡讀讀那些像薛仁貴征東的英雄傳。或想藉此過些（懷古癮。）　　大約，再過些時候，這些殘餘的（懷古癮）怕也要一齊絕根了吧！腦子上閃過西貢書攤上的征東征西束子，似乎隠約可以聽見：安南老前輩的嘆息聲，和西貢港口的海濤嗚咽，一齊在哀泣着吧？　　當我離開安南的時候，在將開走的西貢岸的法國郵船上，靠着船沿在看着中國報紙中的大標題：（東北失陷······）的時候，不自禁深深的嘆息：　　（亡國的人們喲！·······）又念着：　　（原來安南已經亡了國，莫怪領嘗不到牠的眞情調！）　　回頭向西貢市内望望，那些書攤在遥遥不見中。現在想起來，眞是十分憶念牠呵！那時候，我們的海棠葉，還没有註定了的缺一大角呢！昆明（下）  李喬　　昆明在夏天，這裏的景緻，那更好了，湖裏滿是一片可愛的蒼翠，荷花的清香會時時溢進人的鼻孔裏，使你感覺到的，是異常的陰凉和愉快！　　緊貼近海心亭旁的，是很清冷的綠楊村，在這裏可以吃的是茶，你若同兩三個朋友坐在樹蔭下，一面品着茗，一面飽覽着湖上的風景，够風雅了。　　若在月夜，這裏比白天還更有味的。一對對的青年男女往往偎貼在一塊，躱在樹蔭下，密密的在談情話。湖上是一片月光的清輝，一切是那末靜悄悄的，只有低垂着的柳條輕輕的在搖動着。這情景，眞够一個詩人的歌詠了。　　鄰近翠湖的圓通山，那也是一個很好的遊息地。你若天天逛翠湖，逛得太厭煩了，不妨就到山上去走走，那能給你一個新的剌激：若是在午後去，你可以眺望西山頂上落日的晚霞；大清早晨去，你可以看見太陽浴着的滇池，和被朝霧蒙着的遠村，這些都能使你發生一些幻想，詩人似的甜蜜的幻想。······　　出昆明小西門外，離城大約有七八里的地方，還有一個大名鼎鼎的大觀樓，那裏臨近滇池，很有些同杭州的西湖相似；不過氣魄比西湖大，不像西湖那末淡妝濃抹的妖媚樣子。若在春秋佳日，同朋友坐着船從柳蔭下的小河裏駛出去，或唦唦地踏着樹蔭，向西直去，不到一個鐘頭，半掩藏在樹葉裏的大觀樓便到了。　　那地方很宏大，一進門是植着幾顆疏柳的湖堤，環着一潭清水，堤上有着高高的拱橋，再進去是一塊寬闊的草塲，塲的右邊是一廊茶舍，對面那邊是一廊西式樓房，正面是攬勝閣，大觀樓便在這攬勝閣的後面。你若要瞻仰滇池的風景，可登上大觀樓上，那白茫茫的一片海和天，那洶湧的波濤，那常年蒼翠着的西山，便一切在眼裏了。　　你若喜歡循湖堤走走，那你可穿過假山下的岩洞，走到樓外樓那邊去，在清澈如鏡的水裏，你會驚嘆贊美的，是那巍峨的屋宇，和堤上那疏柳的倒影！　　除此而外，到昆明來還不能不遊一遊的，是林木幽闃的西山，和吳三桂在那裏登過龍位的金殿。清凉幽雅的黑龍潭，和羅漢很多的築竹寺，那也值得玩玩的。　　昆明人都生得有一張會說話的嘴巴子，一個人同一個人見着，客氣得要死！即使在一個家裏，也是那末嚕哩嚕囌的不怕人難爲情的怪客氣。但因着一點小事，他們便會吵到一兩個鐘頭不會息。倘若你和他們起了衝突，你不要跟他們鬥嘴，因爲你鬥不過他；你最好很兇猛的一來就給他一個嘴巴！他便很馴伏的不敢同你吵了。　　昆明的氣候變化得很快，在晴朗的時候，都是春天那般的暖和，一下起雨來，可有些清冷了。所以，有一句俗語：（四季無寒署，一雨變成冬）。　　聽說，有一個到雲南來旅行過的外國人說，在昆明每天在街上走着，非叫一個隨行把一年四季的衣服都完全　着跟你走不可！　　這話眞是不錯。可是昆明的氣候是没有北方那麽大寒大熱的。在極熱的時候，熱度不上八十度，冬天冷的時候，也不容易見到雪，一年到頭差不多就都是春天一般的天氣呵。從火山歸來（八）  蘭如　　回到火口茶屋，大家搶着喝了幾瓶汽水，然後抬了一張照，留作紀念。　　下午雖是陰天，然而四週的景色，看得清清楚楚：澄清的，碧綠的像鏡一般的海，映着蜿蜒的，崗蠻起伏的伊豆底山。三浦半島和房總山遥遥對峙，在海的東北邊浮着一個秀麗年輕，全身披着素紗的少女影子的那就是終年積雪不融的富士峯。火山的東南連接着水天蒼茫的太平洋；西南伊豆的許多小島如盆如石地羅列着稍一抬頭往上面看去天頂好像就在我們的頭上伸手就可抓到太陽似的。　　這就是火山的壯觀火山的奇麗！　　回來因爲大家都到了精疲力竭的程度所以每人僱了一匹馬騎着本來我是想騎駱駝的但嫌牠太慢爲了要趕上下午三點開東京的船許多好地方如役行者窟波浮港大島烟台······都不能去參觀不能不說是道次旅行的美中不足。　　我們一行二十個人（連馬伕）排着隊伍踏着沙漠走着照相師緊跟在我們的後面拉生意。　　（來吧這里的風景太美人了給我拍一張照片吧。）　　我拉住馬繮停住了縱目四眺這兒後面和左右是一片渺渺茫茫的沙漠前面是翠綠的樹林淡淡的陽光照在灰色的沙漠上映着我自己的影子；風景的確再好没有了於是就拍了一張照片。準備寄給我懷戀的在那遥速的湘水之濱底伊人。　　回來的路與去時的路不同過了沙漠後完全是青翠的樹林路很陟馬也許因爲老而無力的原故簡直比駱駝還走得慢好幾次我幾乎被跌了下來眼望着險阻傾陟的路不由得膽戰心驚。但我常自己安慰自己：（第一次騎馬都没有跌下現在是老資格了還怕什麽。）這麽一想，膽就大起來了什麽都不怕了。　　這一帶的風景，眞有點像我國蘇杭的那麽美麗不；這比蘇杭美多了！由樹縫裏你可望到碧綠的渺茫的海椿樹的香氣比玟瑰比桂花還要醉人。從樹林裏走出來的像神話中描寫着的山神似的女人她們都是用頭頂着柴捆。衣服和頭部的裝飾都是日本古代的舊風她們是十足的鄉飽姥不但没有渲染過絲毫歐美摩登的習尚而且連摩登的模特兒都没有看見過。她們是純樸的天眞而健美的少女們看到我們都微笑着舉行目迎目送禮或者說一聲：（再來呵！）　　走下山來太陽正燦爛地照着染紅了碧綠的海染紅了青翠的山。　　回到船上每個人的第一件工作是洗臉對着鏡子一照連自己都不認識自己了、除了一對眼珠還是亮的外一切都改變了黝黑骯髒的臉眞像個從煤坑裏跑出來的黑炭夫。　　船又蕩漾在茫茫的大海中了！搭客們都像死了一般地睡着我雖然疲倦得連動都不能動但是奇怪得很任我怎樣想睡也不能睡着我細細地回味着火山所給與我的印象沙漠給與我的感想。我希望明年櫻花開時和特靜悄悄地重來火山憑弔那些最近自殺的英靈。更希望自己在人生的旅途上前進要有如這次在沙漠中旅行挣扎着前進的精神！　　九點四十分船抵靈岸島大家分散我孤零零地踏上了寂靜的歸途。（完）　　（註）：Ｓayannara是譯音意思是（再會）在日本短時的離别固然全用Ｓayaunara　　就是死别也可用這個字的。蒼蠅（二）  意Ｐiandello　作　席條塵譯　　他現在拖着脚走到照相前面去站着；裂着嘴粗暴無禮的冷笑將身低躬了下去伸出雙臂把他病了的女兒獻給它。　　（薛薛耐你所要的在這裏丨）　　薛薛耐是當日他母親慣愛喚到他的名字；他的母親原希望他很大因爲他是（彭嘉敏）（Ｂenjamin）一家的棟樑一家的靠背。　　（薛薛耐！）　　他像隻瘋狗樣的迎接托托利西兩兄弟。　　（你們又要什麽？）　　薩羅帽子拿在手裏氣都透不過來的說着話。　（醫生，有個可憐的人，我們的表兄，要死了丨）　　（快樂的人！打鐘慶樂罷！）醫生喊道。　　（不是，先生丨他要死了，突然之間，也不知道是什麽毛病。在蒙脫魯沙附近，一個馬棚裏。）　　醫生退後一步，悍然說道：　　（在蒙脫魯沙？）　　蒙脫魯沙離村有七哩多路。而且又是條怎樣的道路！　　（是的，先生，趕快趕快，看慈懇的面上！）薩羅哀求道。（他全身黑得像塊肝！腫得怕人丨請走吧！）　　（但是走去怎麽可以？）醫生叫道。（十哩路，用脚走去？你瘋了！騾子丨我要騾子！你們可曾帶了來？）　　（我馬上就去弄，）薩羅趕緊回答，（我去借去。）　　（那末，我，）耐利說道，（同時去刮刮臉。）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言眞理  田舍　　大約自從猿猴變化了人，會說了話，世界上就没有一定的眞理。璧如喝慣咖啡的說雨前淡而無味没有意思。喝慣雨前的說咖啡濃澀刺激没意思。那麽世界上的咖啡和雨前，究竟那一樣有意思？可没有人敢評定，眞理又在那裏呢？然而，這是小焉者也。　　記得在什麽書本子上看到一椿笑話：（有留學生自外國來，什麽皇后號駛抵吳淞口，時值黄昏，月兒當空，留學生從大菜間踱上甲板，想見見祖國光景，不料大失所望，長嘆息曰：唉！連中國的月亮都没有外國的亮。）大意如此，我想這眞奇了，或者中國的月亮眞此外國的遜色？（假使眞有兩個月亮的話）或者那位留學生的眼睛吹了海風？然而，這畢竟是笑話罷了，談不上（理）的。　　不過在現在時候就眞有這種類似（笑話）的事，在一般人的眼光裏，甚麽都說外國人的好，有意思，偉大。於是羣起仿而效之。中國人跪在菩薩面前求籤，（求財得財，求子得子）是迷信，外國人閉着眼睛，向天禱告，（求上帝保佑）便不是迷信。中國人在馬路上用拳頭相打，打出血來，野蠻！外國人用來福槍，自來水皮帶對付人文明！？把財神菩薩和聖誕老人相提並論，不被駡得皮色轉紅，我不信也。我不提倡求籤，但我也不敢讚美禱告，打架雖野蠻，開來福槍也不見得如何文明。假使說外國人的鼻子高（高得好），我倒附議。　　可是跟外國人學的　大有人在，皮膚黄，鼻子扁，這是父母血統關係，無能爲力的。有舍親者，歐美通也，他有一個兩歲的兒子，本來小棉襖小棉褲穿得很舒服的，他說太呆笨了，於是給換上外國童裝，把從未着過風的小腿露出半截在外面，未及半天就生子病，三天就送了命，却怪中國的孩子没出息。又有隔壁的三好婆，想補補身體，她見外國人都是吃牛奶吃胖的，於是亦吃牛奶，不數天，鼻孔裏放血了，她不說自己的體質不合，却怨福氣欠缺。　　砒霜和安神藥片都可以治病，同時，亦都可以送命，由此觀之，天下又那裏來一定的眞理呢，卽使有，亦被人類攪混了，在現在時候要想說（眞理）的話，還是（免開尊口）吧！食堂中的故事  代尼　　請隨便指定一個時間吧，發生了這樣一件故事丨　　譬如說：當音樂響起來的時候，三層樓的食堂中坐滿了高貴的紳士和年青的太太，燈光像蛇燄一般從四壁間吐露出來，纓絡的絲絨窗幔隔離了外面刮着西北風的天空，那些伶俐的侍者穿着潔白的制服穿梭般的來往着，是晚餐的時候了！　　在温暖的空氣中，音樂彷彿春風似的陶醉了每一對年青的伴侣的心靈。　　這時候，被皇家制服扮演着的活動廣告牌，機械地拉開了克羅米銅柱的玻璃門，海燕彷彿的掠進一位没有冬天的上海小姐，丨丨紳士太太們，我很榮幸，介紹這位（故事）中的主角葉佩衡小姐！　　葉小姐有我們兩位皇后的眼風及酒渦，從她的面上，一個决意自殺的人將要失去了刹那間的情感衝動，而頓悟人生是有重大的意義的。葉小姐就是那樣滿面春風的從石級上飄下來：神話中的仙女一樣。　　每一個穿着白制服的侍者在隨便那裏灣腰，每一對紳士太太的眼睛集中在葉小姐的身上，每一個音樂師的弓弦上奏出了更迷人的音調，霓紅燈光變換了紫葡萄色，整個食堂的空氣濃霧似的壓着人們的心頭。　　（葉佩衡小姐萬歲！）　　她輕盈的從每個站起身來招待她的紳士們旁掠過，一個時裝展覽會中姿勢似的佇立在一對年青夫婦的面前。　　年青的紳士站起身來，那樣忸怩地介紹了他的太太，侍者伶俐地添上了一對刀叉。　　第一個湯端了上來，年輕的紳士開口了：　　（葉小姐，許久不見）！　　那個斜眤着皇后的眼風，放下搯湯的銀匙說：　　（想討杯喜酒吃哩，丨什麽時候結婚的）？　　（上個月的今天）。細聲的回答。　　（自然許久不見了，這悠長的三十天呵）！　　仰起頭來笑着，我記不起那個影片中有這末一個鏡頭丨多柔和，多美的特寫！　　（許多朋友告訴我），葉小姐繼續道：（小吳上杭州秘密結婚，我始終不相信這類無稽的謠傳，誰知道呢？丨吳太太漂亮啊）！　　（葉小姐太會說笑話）！吳太太有了說話的機會。（葉小姐没有結婚）？　　年青的紳士沉默着，在（故事）開始的時候，是應有的態度。　　（可以說結過婚了）！葉小姐又笑了起來，（但是！我的丈夫又第二次結婚了）。　　葉小姐揚起了修長的眉毛，顯得楚楚可憐的樣子。　　（這在法律上···）　　（是呵），葉佩衡搶着說：（我想同吳先生商量，他是吳先生的至好朋友呢。吳先生，你看···）　　葉小姐等候着吳先生的回答，吳先生沉下頭，他已不知道怎樣來處理這（故事）了。吳太太驚奇的注視着這兩位主角，她覺得自己也被牽進這（故事）中來了。　　（這倒底是怎末一回事）？　　（吳太太，我很抱歉），葉小姐說：（記得那一天我早上醒來，我的丈夫已不在我的身傍了。許多朋友告訴我，他是上杭州秘密結婚，吳太太，我很抱歉，吳先生丨就是我的丈夫）！　　吳太太驚愕了，但是立卽　恢復常態。　　（葉小姐，是的，許多朋友告訴我，吳先生從前有個，有個女人跟着他，這樣說來，恐怕就是葉小姐了，眞是值得抱歉的事，我們等候着法院的傳票罷！　　諸位紳士，太太們，我所知道的（故事），完了；以後社會新聞版中或者有詳細情形告訴你們，再會。一般人的衣食住北風帶來的消息  列　　自己確是很慚愧，還不過是初冬的季候，我已特别的感到挨當不住，因之一向開着的窗子，現在是整日價緊閉着了。窗外的西北風，虎虎地刮着我並不怎樣感覺到。　　晚飯過後，照例是要在書桌前深沉的默坐很久，然後才看書，或者寫點稿子。這時分，尤基是我一天的心境最恬靜的時候，同事們在室内閒談，我是不大搭嘴的。這日，更是僅僅我一個人坐在室裏，正當靜默已到了深邃迷忽的當兒，忽被外來的飄忽的聲嚮刺激醒了，我傾耳一聽，却仍和平日一樣的恬靜。然而我終不相信，於是我端詳的承着窗縫脈脈射進的寒風，聽了上五分鐘，終使我一躍而起，推開着窗，發現了我在上海七年來僅見的奇蹟。原來那聲響是這樣的：（要買小孩子的吧，幾個小孩</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊英小說家華坡爾從編影劇所得的敎訓  塵雄　　文藝與電影，許多人都都公認兩者有密切的關係，但一說到文藝作家與編影劇人就有些不同了。文藝作家是站在一個很高位置的立塲上，爲許多人所崇拜愛慕；編影劇人不但没有文藝作家的威風，在社會上除了一些影界同行外，編影劇人差不多没有人認識他的。所以文藝作品儘管有很多搬到銀幕上，一般文藝作家從來就很少爲銀幕直接去寫文章的。　　最近電影界似乎稍染着文藝色彩，在美國影界清潔運動的富兒，這種趨向或許是暫時的，然而文藝作品大批底搬上銀幕，也可以知道文藝與電影已漸漸底比前更接近了。在這種銀幕趨向文藝形勢之下，就發現不少文藝作家直接爲銀幕寫文章，或者索性做一個編影劇人。我們可以舉例的是（世界史綱）作者威爾斯已經加入倫敦影片公司編劇員了。與威爾斯同輩的英國小說家華坡爾（Ｈugh　Walpole），也受了美國米高梅公司之聘，數月前到好萊塢做一個編劇員。　　華坡爾在米高梅公司做一個編劇員之外，同時監製米高梅攝拍中迭更斯名著（塊肉餘生）一片。米高梅公司因鑒於（小婦人）等類文藝電影大受觀衆歡迎，所以從事攝製兩部偉大的文藝電影，一部就是日前在南京開映的史蒂芬遜名著（金銀島）；一部就是（塊肉餘生）（Ｄavid　Ｇopperlield）。爲愼重起見，米高梅不惜重資去英國陋來華坡爾來做，監製工作，因爲華坡爾是現在英國惟一知道迭更斯生平與著作的專家，也是迭更斯基本金執行委員會的會長。　　在美國讀者當中，華坡爾不是一個生疎的人。他曾數次赴美，演講各地。他的二十五部小說作品，已遍譯各國文字。所以他實生是世界文藝作家中一個產量最豐富而字數最多的小說家了。他到了好萊塢後數天就寫了一篇東西，照他的小說作法這裏所寫的是最好没有了。誰知他的一篇東西拿到米高梅劇務部，那裏的人把一個（劣）字大大底寫在横面。華坡爾看見他的文章被人家這樣批評，當然可以馬上發火，拿着文藝作家本色，立即向米高梅當局辭職，或者要控告他們侮辱的。　　三十年來華坡爾以一個小說家尊嚴，他的作品没有一個膽敢去批評修改的。誰知道到了好萊塢，就要白白受這種氣。不過華坡爾當時自知電影是他的外行，米高梅方面樣樣都優待他，所以他寗忍一時之辱，而領受一番所謂電影文學的秘訣。　　這個秘訣就是他不能以寫小說方法去寫影劇；寫小說是給心讀的，寫影劇是給眼讀的。寫影劇時作者要自己能够（見）得到的；寫小說可以長篇大論的，寫影劇就要縮减，以簡單的字給演員做作，同時還要給他說話。　　華坡爾本來在好萊塢停留兩星期時間就把工作做完回去英國的。他以爲寫一部小說是很困難的事，初不料寫影劇要這樣長久時間而工作又要這樣困難的。現在華坡爾已經把（塊肉餘生）劇本弄好，這片子攝竣之後，他預備把他在好萊塢所得經騐，直接爲銀幕寫一個劇本，因爲他感覺寫給銀幕實在比寫小說文字有興趣得多了。影片談評評（獄底餘生）  凌鶴　　Ｇreat　Ｅxpectatlons丨大上海　　關於原著者却利迭更斯（ＣharlesＤlckns）似乎用不着我來介紹他的作品在中國翻譯過很多現在我祇想就這（獄底餘生）簡單的說一下。　　在這一故事中作爲寫實主義作家的迭更斯，他對於浪漫主義作家所樂於描寫的復仇之類的題材，仍然感覺很大的興趣，劇中人麥格惠許的個性由於復仇或義氣的各方面確是表現得十分重動的。　　在這裏原著者反對十九世紀英國女的拘束與守舊同時他對於鐵匠出身的男主人公給與了大極大的同情。自然我們不會忽視對白中幾次道及鐵匠成爲紳士囚犯的女人成了Ｌadye所以他們男女主人公在囚犯臨終時的勉慰聲中結合了。同樣囚犯麥格惠許的殘酷的遭遇作者在他身上表現了很大的同情但是作者在這裏所表示的是囚犯極力向上他逃獄他開鑛發射他化錢給鐵匠出身的青年讀書使他成爲紳士。這裏正是正面的表現迭更斯是當時的改良主義者在這（獄底餘生）中各方面都表現出來。　　搬演前代的文學作品或戲劇到如今形成了主要的傾向。然而在電影作家選擇文學作品的時候他們决不會盲目的採取一定得適合電影作家的觀念更考慮某些文學作品在如今仍是有利他們所屬的一羣之共同利益的。因此迭更斯的作品到如今搬上銀幕了。所以在這裏我們指出作品的内在估價它在目前開映的意義正是很有必要的了。　　電影上的（獄底餘生）就是表現方法來說自然不會給我們輕易指出缺點來的，整個的是電影藝術的圓熟的表現。</p>
<p>這無論是個人的演技或是導演編劇方面都有極好的成績不過這是很注重的保持了文學電影的嚴肅性像目下所流行的輕快趣味的濃厚却是缺乏的了。評（十三個女性）  尤兢　　Ｔhirteen　Ｗomen上海映　　荒誕，庸俗，淺薄，無聊······這張片子也許是以最高的紀錄，做了一九三四年的壓軸戲了。謂余不信，那末，咱們瞧：　　說是有一位白種父親與爪哇母性產生的混血兒烏蘇拉小姐，在秀麗的容貌中生有一副惡毒與兇殘的心腸，因此不能和同學們相處下去。她在催眠術預言家史華米手下充當助手，利用一般女子多疑善妒的心理假借史華米的名義寫了十二封信寄給從前的十二位女同學預言各人將遭受到各種悲慘的刧運。　　銀幕上從她的模仿簽名式開始，接着由郵政局傳佈開去。　　梅小姐接信後在馬戲表演中跌死了瓊小）發了瘋。據說明書上說還有一位曼麗小姐　狂以及海時爾女士犯罪入獄的可是在畫面上都没有看到。這樣斷續地映過許多片段之後接着算是戲的展開了。　　羅拉所接到的信中說是她的兒子在滿六歲的生日之後要死的。羅拉就邀海倫米商量。恰巧海倫同烏蘇拉同行在火車中受了烏的蠱惑神志不清地自殺了。　　劇情就跟着這些零亂斷續的膠片與荒唐怪誕的事跡轉入到偵探方面來了。可是出奇的這偵探的動機不是出於海倫的自殺和烏蘇拉在她死後偷竊飾物這案件上而是由於羅拉的委托。這時烏蘇拉爲了要實現她的預言起見就呌車夫送個炸彈來做羅拉兒子生日的禮物又恰巧地羅拉帶着一件不知道是危險物的禮物坐上那個車夫的汽車偵探追來炸彈爆裂車夫被捕。發現了烏蘇拉與車夫間的秘密。她在逃往紐約的火車上被偵探逼得跳車自殺。其中用兩三次的報紙的插入說明了其他幾個女性的自殺殺夫發狂入獄等。　　此外它把烏蘇拉自己不免於死認作（惡有惡報）的說敎也是滑稽得說不過去的吧。特别電影廣告學  福　　當（公子多情）（Ｓadie　Ｍckee）尚未公映之前，紐約的旅館裏許多房間，忽然都發現了一種紙片上面寫着；（莎弟瑪琪過訪不遇）等字。那是女人的筆跡並目是寫在便條上的，後面還註着；（請便即通電社里尼蒂七一四一）。果然，杜里尼蒂七一四一的電話，不斷地響了起來，而接綫女郎就一個一個告訴他們說；（莎弟瑪琪是瓊克勞馥新片子的名字。等到公映的時候請你務必光臨······）最近，（風流寡婦）在紐約公遇之前，米高梅的當局先在各報上發起了一個）（編句竸賽）。要將（風流寡婦）（Ｍerry　Ｗidow）十個字母每一個字母寫一兩個字共成一句。結果以下的一句得了頭奬：　　ＭAGNILICENT　ＥFFERVESCENT　ＲOLILCKING　rOMANTIC　yOUTHFUL　With　alits　Memor　able　Delighfful　OriginalWonlers　　以上一句的意思不過稱讚（風流寡婦）超絕的華貴恕不細譯了。（風流寡婦）的名貴  雲門　　美國第一流香艶喜劇家劉劉謙，現又把他生平最得意的（風流寡婦）　演於銀幕了。按（風流寡婦）原名Ｄie　Ｌutige　Ｗilwe是在一九○五年初現於奥國維也納的舞臺、獲到非常的成功，也就是劉别謙作風的勝利。同時這個香艶詼諧，清歌妙舞的喜劇，也獲取世界的認識。當時飾（寡婦）成名的，是奥國女伶密倩戈恩塞Ｍitzi　Ｇnentirer而飾伯爵爵唐尼羅的德魯門Ｌouis　Ｔraumann從茲一躍而成紅明星了。　　米高梅公司費資五十萬金鎊，以攝製這個饒於大陸作風的（Ｃontinenta　Ｓtyle）古典派歌舞喜劇（Ｍusical　Ｃlassic）而毫不吝惜因爲每一個辨士都有它的代價。那末（風流寡婦）的眞價值　可以用不着證明的了。所以在紐約公映時候座價雖已激增可是觀衆還像潮水般擁擠至今不衰。更可貴者劉别謙氏所著各項歌曲銀幕上全部保存吾們也可得窺其全豹。僅僅音樂器具一部其價己值數百萬美金。其中一隻提琴是世界上三美之一（大音樂師樂勃洛夫的家珍）其餘還有不少數百年前古物。至於片中舞的程式歸拉許氏ＡlbertinaRasch編列而歌曲仍由世界聞名的譜曲家佛蘭李哈氏Ｆranz　Ｌaelir製造至若技術背景情調配音等有米高梅的榮譽作保證的。「再生花」彙誌　　再生花整整地攝製了一年工作人員可吃盡了苦頭熱天關在攝影裏可熱得要命最近胡蝶演尋桃哥兒一塲爲了把握劇情的情調關係、用幾百匹馬力的大風扇對準着她吹這又冷得吃勿消。　　趙大媽宣景琳演被錢大帥的兵嚇病了的一塲可演得眞（嘸啥）讀者諸君可知道那一塲她是（假戲眞做）。抱病而拍的。　　鄭老夫子導演（再生花）比（姊妹花）　費了許多腦汁！怎樣來强調再生花中的軍閥比姊妹花中更擅威作福平民們的生活更血涙滂沱。爲避免沉悶起見又引出了二寳以前的一叚羅曼使。　　桃哥兒小秋在製再生花的時候子喜又急喜的是他將有了一個小小秋急的是（再生花）中他一方面躭心着趙大媽的病和孩子小扭兒的啼哭一方面又想和李大哥去幹革命工作當然在這種情形下是要焦急萬分了。這喜一急可苦了小秋。　　「風流寡婦」中月下偷情麥唐納與希佛萊合演——南京今日開映電影漫話  羅平　　卜萬蒼因（青春交響樂）雖有軀殼而無骨幹故將放棄此劇本。昨日本刋所載之消息與事實略有出入合亟更正。　　映ＸＸＸＸ　　（筆戰强權）是叙一個法國革命文豪伏爾慕的一生在這裏不僅是喬治亞立斯的表演的計劃入微他的那種爲了）公正自由平等）而對於不義抗爭的精神在這個時代出現是多少有其價值的至少比了（金銀島）。　　特别是最後的一句話（我雖没有兵器但是我有我的筆。）　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　曼麗畢克馥將與（大飯店）導演愛德門高爾婷合組一新影片公司。　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　俄國名導演愛森斯坦已開始攝製一新片片名Ｃhelyuskin。　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　米高梅公司將攝。以牛津大學爲背景之Ｍanners　Ｍaketh　the　Ｍan已由原作者約翰蒙克沙特與英國名編劇約翰潑特卡斯丹開始編寫電影劇本。　　ＸＸＸＸＸ　　微微出版社出版之（藝術畫報）創刋號將於明年元旦出版。申報電影專刋投稿略例　　一本刋爲輔助文化宣揚藝術之電影刋物對於外來稿件均甚歡迎一經登載酬報從豐　　一文字旣經登載給酬版權槪歸申報所有　　一本刋文字以語體文爲主並須用新式標點　　一投稿時每篇須加蓋印章否則以却酬論　　一本刋篇幅有限文字應力求簡短每稿以五百字左右爲限　　一來件如係譯文應附原著夾雜英文可省則者　　一文字照片等等除預先聲明及附回函郵資者外一槪不負保存或退還之責　　一稿紙勿兩面書寫及横寫亦勿用鉛筆寫電影小說風流寡婦（The　Merry　Widow（五）  素華　　下面所奏的音樂正是昨晚的曲譜。内心的了解使他們跳舞了。吻着笑着談着　他們是陶醉着。一陣樹葉發出的聲音在他們後面響了同時有一個人急急的走進屋裏去。唐爾納便聽得大使的聲音正在命人打電給國王報告他們戀愛的成功。接着大使又收到由國王來的一封電報說：（唐爾納在麥茜己將秘密洩漏）各國皆知命立即用迅速手段禁絕謠言。否則寡婦聞此消息則事殆矣等語。）這一來可把大使急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻。過了一會他忙找唐爾納和蘇麗亞。他就當衆宣佈他們兩人訂婚的消息。蘇麗亞莫明其妙的剛想問唐爾納可是唐爾納却追着大使入内室去了。在裏面唐爾納責問大使到底是怎麽一回事。大使就把電報遞給他看。他看完了一聲也不響就走了。開了房門却看見蘇麗亞。她的眼睛是潮濕着。他抱着她說道：（蘇麗亞現在有些話我想一定要告訴你的。）她聽了就立刻去把門上的小窗關了。那時唐爾納曉得剛才大使的話都已給她聽到了。（你還有什麽話要告訴我嗎？）（没有了）他的聲音是失望。他繼續着道：（但是我是愛你的。）他剛想去抱她她把他推開了顫着道：（你不必再向我解釋。我明白了。什麽人也知道你爲什麽愛我的了。）她臨走的時候哮着道：（我是相信你的。）　　唐爾納苦着臉踱了出來人客都向他道賀。可是他一聲不響。蘇麗亞滿臉涙痕的在一只角裏瞧着他。他忽然向人家宣佈道：（剛才宣佈的訂婚消息是完全誤會我代表蘇小姐說她是完全没有這種意思的。蘇麗亞可悲到極點了。唐爾納行近了她聲音夾着失望和悲哀的道：（事情已經過去没有什麽話說了。我不願有什麽解釋不過在我離開你之前我要說一聲：（菲菲我愛你。）她心裏是受着創傷面上還勉强現着笑容回頭和另外一班男子去跳舞。忽然她瞧見兩個馬蘇維亞的軍官走進來向唐爾納說道：（我們奉王命將你逮捕。）他就解除了他的武裝被押出了大使館。　　爲了道件事馬蘇維亞就全國鼎沸起來。王宫裏也是一樣的不安靜。每個人都惶慮着國家的財政崩潰。在法庭裏面人多得水洩不通婦女尤其是特别的多。唐爾納在犯人廣裏。拍夫大使大使的秘書麥茜裏的客人和唐爾納自己的僕人都是在證人席裏。不一回法官起來說道：（我控告衛隊長唐爾納有賣國行爲辦公不力行爲失歛致危及國家利益。）忽然在旁聽的人叢裏像有人軋出來的樣子。審判官現着歡迎的面孔他瞧見走上來的就是蘇麗亞。她向着法官陳說道：（他是没有罪的爲了國家他是欺騙了我。你不要定他的罪。應該賞給他一個勳章。他己用盡了詭計說盡了他的謊話。他欺騙了我用情感和愛情來煽動我他奉了命令就不惜去搗碎一個女人的心靈。）她說到這裏唐爾納勉强着起來道：（法官可准我向她問幾句話嗎？）法官就允許了他。唐爾納站起來走到蘇麗亞那邊問道：（我騙了你嗎？）（是的）她肯定她答。（我是和你開玩笑嗎？）他問。（除了玩笑就没有别的）她答。（我和你跳舞的時候是在轉你金錢的念頭嗎？）（當你抱着我的時候也是在轉這念頭）（我的舉動是有計劃的嗎？）（是的）她肯定地答。（那末當我吻你的時候呢？）（那是你欺騙我最大的地方。）（未完）</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Promoting National Goods and the National Goods Education Season</h3>
<p>Since 1930, China's foreign trade deficit has reached approximately 70 to 80 million yuan per year. In total, over five years, more than 370 million yuan has flowed out. Such a huge leak shows how much the Chinese people purchase and use foreign goods. The sales of national goods are, of course, deprived. As a result, agriculture, industry, and commerce are all greatly affected, forming today's extremely serious economic national crisis. Production decreases daily, unemployment increases annually, the people's blood and sweat are becoming exhausted, and the country's lifeline is on the verge of collapse. The danger ahead is indescribable. Therefore, now, to talk about saving the nation and ensuring survival, the most effective way to stabilize the people's livelihood is to promote national goods. Its effect can passively reduce the outflow of money, and actively promote the revitalization of various industries. The elimination of foreign goods, the increase in production, the elimination of unemployment, and the restoration of vitality all depend on this.</p>
<p>The above discussion is very common sense. The Chinese people can all talk about it. However, the active promotion of national goods is probably only a recent event. A few years ago, the national salvation movement mostly focused on one side. Enthusiastic people, stimulated by foreign insults, were temporarily filled with indignation and focused on retaliation against those who invaded us. Attention was not focused on ordinary foreign goods, and the import of foreign goods increased year by year. The outflow of money not only did not decrease slightly, but became even more severe. However, in the past one or two years, the call for promoting national goods has become louder, and the meaning contained in the promotion has gradually become more advanced. Everyone knows that the main goal is to save the national economy. Therefore, last year, some people encouraged each other with the saying "National Goods Year." This year, the "Women's National Goods Year" was advocated by the women's community. Recently, educational, industrial, and commercial groups in Shanghai have gone a step further, jointly initiating the establishment of a "Children's National Goods Year" and a "Student's National Goods Year" next year to appeal to the public. In addition, the establishment of national goods stores and the organization of national goods propaganda groups are like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and they are flourishing. At a time when the country is under the economic aggression of the great powers and the people are suffering from poverty, it is essential to promote national goods in this way. We should not take it lightly.</p>
<p>However, we still have something to say about the future promotion of national goods, that is, the Chinese people's psychology of welcoming foreign goods seems to be increasing daily. There is a saying that "the Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high." May I ask, have the general Chinese people thoroughly weighed the gains and losses of using foreign goods in their hearts? Can they, like the people of European, American, and Japanese countries, also regard using national goods as an honor and buying foreign goods as a shame? I am afraid they still cannot. I have observed extensively that urban women believe that nothing but foreign goods can satisfy their extravagant desires for all kinds of daily necessities such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. As for national goods, they often dislike them for not being fashionable and discard them. As for ordinary commoners, they all think that foreign goods are cheap and good, and they are happy to buy them. General merchants also see that they can make a profit and do their best to transport and sell them. If the whole country continues to be like this, then even if national products are improved daily, can their sales surpass imported goods?</p>
<p>However, there is no single way to eliminate the Chinese people's psychology of welcoming foreign goods. However, education should especially target children and young people. When they are studying, they are in a position to be educated. Although they have pure nature, they lack the ability to be independent. If their parents and elders can earnestly guide them to despise foreign goods and believe in national goods, creating a deep and indelible concept and cultivating a simple and sincere atmosphere, it will naturally reduce the psychology of the general public's obsession with foreign goods. Then, the mission of the Children's and Students' National Goods Year next year for all families and school teachers is particularly important. Schools and families are all group lives. Young students are inherently patriotic. If parents and teachers can lead by example and pay attention to teaching and encouragement, it will be very easy to achieve great results. Therefore, we can directly regard the Children's and Students' National Goods Year as the Education Year for National Goods. May all families and schools hear the news and rise up to do so.</p>
<p>The Washington Naval Treaty Has Been in Effect for Thirteen Years</p>
<p>Japan Tore It Up Like Waste Paper</p>
<p>Notice of Treaty Termination Delivered to Washington Today</p>
<p>International Naval Arms Race Difficult to Avoid</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese government will formally announce the termination of the Washington Naval Treaty tomorrow. At that time, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, will deliver Japan's notice of termination to Secretary of State Hull. Japan opposes the 5:5:3 ratio, believing it harms national prestige, and demands equality and a common maximum limit. It also advocates uniformly limiting offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers. The London Naval Conference was adjourned indefinitely due to Japan's termination of the treaty. This treaty, which has been in effect for thirteen years, is the main tool for limiting global shipbuilding. If there is no new tool to replace it in the future, then a shipbuilding race to compete for maritime hegemony will ultimately be unavoidable. Although the treaty's validity has been announced as terminated, it will still be effective for two years. Japan's move to terminate the treaty was expected, as Japan made this decision several months ago. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Naval Talks Barely Alive Davis Postpones Departure from London</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was stated today that the United States delegation to the London Naval Talks, including Davis, was originally scheduled to leave London on Saturday, but this has now been postponed. However, the postponement of their departure is not seen here as an indication that the all-but-dead conference has any hope of revival. According to senior officials, Davis and others are delaying for a few days to wait for the conference to truly expire before departing, in order to avoid the diplomatic responsibility for breaking off the talks.

<h3>Armed Merchant Ships Prepared in Wartime British Newspapers Worry About Future Crisis</h3>
<p>(London) Article 14 of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulates that "(Merchant ships shall not be armed in peacetime for conversion into warships; the strength of their decks shall be limited to the ability to mount guns no larger than six inches in caliber)." After Japan declared the treaty terminated, this provision will also lose its effect upon expiration, i.e., at the end of 1936. The Morning Post's naval correspondent commented on this issue, stating: "In times of trade depression, most countries, in order to protect their shipping, provide subsidies from the government. Since merchant ships receive subsidies from the government, the governments of various countries will inevitably require their merchant ships to install equipment suitable for protection in wartime, and this will be a condition for receiving subsidies. This is self-evident. Even now, at least one major country employs sailors on its merchant ships who are all reservists from its own navy. Since this trend already exists, after the Washington Naval Treaty expires at the end of 1936, countries will only need to take a further step and stipulate that merchant ships receiving government subsidies should have their construction and equipment such that they can immediately mount various guns when war breaks out. These guns will not be limited to six inches in caliber, and it will be permissible to mount eight-inch or larger guns. If so, it will not be difficult for countries with such advantages to build a powerful (secondary), i.e., reserve fleet. Although its strength cannot be compared to a regular fleet, the damage it inflicts on enemy trade and communications will be very significant." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Yoshida Travels to Various Countries</h3>

His itinerary was: Soviet Russia, Poland, Germany, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Then he crossed the Atlantic to America. Yoshida arrived in London from Paris by plane on November 16 of this year and had discussions with Ambassador Matsudaira. He then left for other destinations. Recently, Yoshida has returned from the mainland by plane. The plane he was on landed here this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>President of U.S. Foreign Policy Association Announces Future Joint Policy to Counter Japan</p>
<p>Joining "Free Action" Clause</p>
<p>Supported by Russia, Italy, etc.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo published on the 24th the following remarks by Reikichi Babeel, president of the American Foreign Policy Association, in the New York Times on the 22nd: There are three possible responses for the U.S. to Japan's abrogation of the Washington Treaty: (1) To decide to counteract with a naval building competition. (2) Or to abandon the Far East, focus on the American mainland, and first build naval power to quickly organize a defense. (3) To cooperate with the League of Nations, or to pull in Great Britain and other countries that have a stake in the Far East, to economically isolate Japan, and use the activation of international police powers to restrain Japan. However, these methods are quite difficult in theory and in practice. Therefore, if the United States wants to avoid naval competition and at the same time uphold the rights of various countries under the treaties in the Far East, it must seek appropriate measures. What are the measures? Compromise. In other words, all major naval powers should pledge to substantially continue the naval restrictions stipulated in the Washington and London treaties, and also let Russia, France, and Italy jointly participate in this treaty. If Japan still resists the joint front of Great Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, or is unwilling to participate in the treaty, then a "free action" clause can be inserted into the treaty. If one country is threatened by a non-member country, it will consult with other member countries and not allow shipbuilding beyond the treaty limits. This is a temporary measure for the United States to respect Pacific defense, and the responsibility for changing the status quo will naturally fall solely on Japan. Because if countries can unite together, Japan will only be able to satisfy its claim for equal rights. However, when stipulating this treaty, financial considerations should also be taken into account. It is feared that countries will not be able to maintain their equally powerful navies. If Japan starts building a large navy alone, the United States can freely increase the strength of its fleet according to the "free action" clause. However, naval issues cannot rely solely on naval power and must still emphasize the political background. Therefore, the issue of the neutrality of the Philippines can also be stated in an international treaty. On the one hand, the United States should amend the immigration laws that exclude Japanese people and respect the dignity of Japanese people. In this way, the atmosphere in the Pacific can also be eased. At the same time, the various difficulties of naval issues can be easily resolved.</p>

Today, it was decided to send Has, the French Director of the Transportation Department of the League of Nations Secretariat, to China for two months to assist the Chinese government in developing a grand system of new trade routes throughout China. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations recently decided to send Has, Director of the Transportation Group and Secretary of the Technical Cooperation Committee with China, to China as the Liaison Officer for Technical Cooperation with China. His term will be approximately two months. According to the League of Nations' Council's Technical Cooperation Committee with China, at its previous meeting on September 28, the term of the previous Liaison Officer in China, Dr. Rajchman, had expired on August 1 of this year. It considered reappointing a Technical Liaison Officer to succeed Rajchman in order to ensure liaison with the Chinese National Economic Council. At that time, the Committee believed that there was no urgent need to send someone, but requested League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to take the necessary measures to appoint one of the Directors of the relevant groups of the League of Nations to serve as a short-term Liaison Officer in order to continue the development of the technical cooperation project.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Scandal to Trigger Political Storm</h3>
<p>Involving a Wide Range of Important Figures in Financial and Political Circles</p>
<p>Political Parties Will Rely on It as a Tool to Attack the Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The main reason for the collapse of the Saito cabinet, the so-called Teikoku Rayon Company incident, completed its preliminary hearing on the 27th. After its contents became clear, it suddenly became a major issue in the political world. This case involves former Railway Minister Mitsuchi Chuzo, former Commerce Minister Nakajima Kumanosuke, and other major figures in political and financial circles, and is very serious and complex. When the case is publicly tried next year, it will inevitably cause a major disturbance, especially in the parliament. Not only will the government be attacked for trampling on human rights as a political issue, but the judicial authorities such as Justice Minister Ohara will also be impeached. After the case is expanded, the responsibility of the prosecution authorities below Justice Minister Ohara may also be aroused. In that case, the entire political situation will be greatly affected. Mitsuchi Chuzo said to people that when he was detained by the judicial authorities, he strongly insisted on his innocence. The authorities still could not obtain any material evidence after he confessed. He is determined to fight with the authorities and defend judicial power. (Japan United Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The preliminary hearing of the Teikoku Rayon case ended yesterday, and the details of the case were also announced. In this case, former Commerce Minister Nakajima was considered to have received 200 shares of Teikoku Rayon Company as a bribe and entrusted former Railway Minister Mitsuchi to sell them. The prosecutor interrogated Mitsuchi, but Mitsuchi denied it. However, the prosecutor's office prosecuted Mitsuchi for perjury. In cases that have not been investigated, there is no perjury. Today, newspapers in Tokyo criticized this matter and other issues that were prosecuted without evidence, arousing the issues in the legal profession and society. The Prosecutor General Hayashi of the Great Court of Justice and the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court, Iwamura, discussed the results and made an unprecedented statement by the Chief Prosecutor as follows. Various newspapers criticized the case, or said that it was unprecedented, or revealed words of accusing the preliminary judge, but in fact, it did not violate the law. Whether the case has been completely determined or not, if it is considered that there is a suspicion of crime, it can be prosecuted for public trial. (China United Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Teikoku Rayon case, the world or called the Ministry of Finance scandal, that is, several senior officials such as former Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda and former Director of the Banking Bureau Okubo were prosecuted. Because the matter is closely related to the reputation of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry immediately held a meeting of the heads of the department above the section chief today. As a result, it was considered that these people had absolutely no reason to commit crimes, and it was decided to jointly contribute funds to re-hire lawyers to rescue them. (China United Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The ban on reporting the Ministry of Finance incident was lifted yesterday, and its full picture has been clarified. The charges against the important people are as follows: Former Railway Minister Mitsuchi Chuzo for perjury, former Minister of Commerce and Industry Baron Nakajima Kumanosuke for receiving bribes, and former Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda Hideo, and former Director of the Banking Bureau of the Ministry of Finance Okubo Sadaji,</p>

<h3>Guaranteeing Austria's Independence is Key to Central European Peace</h3>
<p>British-French Talks Mentioned Six-Nation Agreement</p>
<p>Difficult Problems Between France and Italy Cannot Be Resolved Immediately</p>
<p>(London) According to the report of the diplomatic reporter published in the Daily Telegraph, there are more clarifications on the plan of France and Italy to consolidate Central European peace and guarantee Austria's independence. This news is roughly obtained from the British diplomatic circles, so it is quite valuable. The reporter said that not long ago, when Simon and French Foreign Minister Laval talked, the two sides discussed this plan in detail. According to the reporter, the basic idea of ​​the plan is to take Austria's independence as the central hub of the overall European situation. Therefore, once the issue of Austria's independence is resolved, other issues will be solved easily. Furthermore, according to the reporter, the agreement proposed by France and Italy will include six European countries, namely France, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, according to the report of the newspaper and the Times, the initial condition of this agreement is that France and Italy must first achieve a positive result, but this matter is obviously not completed at present. It has not been decided when Laval can set off for Italy, and the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia also makes it difficult to quickly resolve the border issue between France and Italy regarding Africa. Moreover, if the French-Italian plan does not get Germany's participation and cooperation, it will also be useless. As for what Germany's attitude will be, it is still necessary to observe the relationship between Germany and the two countries in the future and how the Saar issue will be resolved.

<h3>(My Struggle) Needs to be Revised</h3>
<p>Anti-French Arguments Will Be Deleted</p>
<p>(Berlin) Before Hitler seized power, he wrote the book (My Struggle), the content of which was to state the domestic and foreign policies of the National Socialist Party. There were many words in it that were hostile to France. This book has been published for several years and has been widely circulated for a while. There are many translations in various countries. It is now heard that Hitler is preparing to revise the original book and publish a new edition, deleting all the words that hurt France, so that French people will not be offended when they read it after it is translated into French. Hitler claimed that (My Struggle) was written by him when he was in prison. At that time, he was concentrating all his efforts on engaging in the party affairs of the National Socialist Party. Therefore, this book spoke from the party's standpoint. Now that he has become the head of state, his remarks should naturally be based solely on the perspective of national interests. The reason why this book needs to be revised is that, according to the recent tendency of the Society Party officials to be compromised, all the slogans and slogans used by the National Socialist Party in the past that were hostile to France have been deleted. This can be further proven. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Germany's New National Movement Embodying Spartan Spirit</h3>
<p>Impressions of a British Media Tycoon's Visit to Germany</p>
<p>(London) British media mogul and Farmers Party leader Lord Rothermere recently went to Berlin to meet with Prime Minister Hitler, and then went to Munich to visit the National Socialist Party headquarters. He recently sent an article from Munich, published in the Daily Mail, strongly praising the Hitler movement, saying (Germany has now revived, because faith is enough to create (miracles). Germans have now found a new faith, and thus have a new soul. Today's Germany is like the Sparta of ancient Greece. The residents of Sparta were only a few thousand, but they occupied an important position in history because their people were rich in national discipline and the spirit of hard work and sacrifice. Now this spirit is seen in the 67 million German people. Among these 67 million people, there are indeed many of the most intelligent, most diligent and most brave people in the world, but no one is as Spartan as Hitler). Rothermere continued to warmly describe Hitler's words and deeds, and concluded by saying, (We have no reason to argue with Germany, for the sake of Germany, for the sake of Britain, and even for the sake of the world, there is no greater benefit than the close cooperation between Britain and Germany. Britain and Germany once signed an alliance in history for more than 20 years. If they are reunited, the prosperous period of Britain and Germany will be almost here). (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Plebiscite Approaching Saar Security on Alert</h3>
<p>In Addition to Closing the Border</p>
<p>Nightclubs Also Banned</p>
<p>Saarbrücken In addition to closing the border, the authorities are also implementing other security precautions. The Saar Governing Commission today ordered a ban on dance halls, bars and shops from operating past midnight. This move is intended to crack down on nightclubs, in order to prevent those who cause chaos from using this as a gathering place. Soldiers of the International Army are not allowed on the streets after 10 pm, but on New Year's Eve, the people of Saar must celebrate all night, and entertainment venues are still allowed to operate after midnight. It is widely believed that this is the last New Year's celebration under the League of Nations administration of the Saar. As for how many people support the Saar belonging to Germany, there are different opinions. Enthusiastic supporters of Germany expect that those who vote for belonging to Germany will account for 85% of the vote. More cautious observers say that it is about 70%, but those who support the current situation believe that they will get 40% of the votes, because the Hitler government is secretly threatening the Saar, and timid people dare not vote for supporting the current situation.

Prime Minister Tartarescu delivered a speech, saying that the government will submit a bill when the parliament resumes, requesting an increase in national defense expenditure of 20 billion Lei (equivalent to more than 300 million francs) (this is the insurance premium for our country's borders). Tartarescu then stated that the revisionists of the treaty are propagating vigorously, and it is necessary to respond to them, otherwise, it may be regarded as giving up their rights. (Some people say that the boundaries should be revised, and we will answer, please revise your conscience first, because you have abused the weak for ten centuries, which is unprecedented in history.

<h3>US Train Accident</h3>
<p>Two Accidents in One Day, Dozens Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Columbus Two train accidents occurred in the United States today, killing 17 people and injuring more than 50 people. The first tragedy occurred near Powellton, when the locomotive of a miner's train suddenly exploded. At least 15 people were killed and 41 were injured. After the tragedy occurred, the cause of the accident could not be investigated immediately because the driver and fireman were killed at the same time. However, it was heard that the explosion of the steam boiler was caused by carelessness when the boiler was constructed. The steam rushed into the car windows, and many passengers could not escape from the car and were burned to death. The second tragedy occurred here when a passenger car from Pennsylvania derailed while passing through a fork. Two people were killed and ten were seriously injured. The railway officials are now investigating the matter, but it has not been determined who is responsible. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>Factory Inspection Office Formulates Implementation Steps</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Factory Inspection Office has formulated steps for factory inspection. 1. Mines in various places should be inspected together. 2. Foreign-funded factories are limited by the environment and cannot be promoted smoothly. Our office will overcome all difficulties and strive to promote the inspection of foreign-funded factories so that Chinese factories and foreign-funded factories can comply with the regulations of the revised Factory Law. 3. The first phase of the factory inspection implementation plan in various provinces and cities will be completed this year. 4. According to the guidance and supervision of our office, there are 17 provinces and cities that have implemented factory inspection. Other provinces and cities that have not yet implemented inspection should consider and supervise the implementation based on their industrial development. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the negotiations on the factory inspection of the Shanghai Concession have become a stalemate and are difficult to resolve since the Municipal Council revised the Yangjingbang land regulations. At this year's International Labor Conference, Li Pingheng contacted representatives from various countries and the Director of the International Labor Office, Butler, several times in Geneva. Butler agreed to go to Britain and France to help us. Li also went to Britain and France after the meeting and visited former French Minister of Labor and current Senator Gotagar, current Minister of Labor Maggati, and British Undersecretary of the Ministry of Labor, Sir Roland Baaum and others. After detailed discussions, they all agreed to study in good faith and give sympathetic solutions. As for Italy and the United States, they have contacted each other in Geneva. Representatives from both countries believe that what China is fighting for is indeed justified. Now the government is based on this international goodwill environment and is discussing further with the Shanghai Concession authorities. It is hoped that a solution will be reached soon.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Prepares to Move to Baoding</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government will move to Baoding. The province has decided to send personnel to investigate after the new year. It is planned to select one of the old governor's office and the old imperial palace for renovation. The project will start in the spring, and the construction cost will be about 400,000 to 500,000. Although the provincial treasury is difficult, it is determined to raise funds and not ask the central government for help. However, the newly selected houses are narrow. In the future, all the provincial organs will move there at one time, or will move there one after another, depending on the situation of the project. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The new budget for the entire Hebei Province is being compiled. Because the income is insufficient, the Department of Finance is planning to open up new sources of income while striving to reduce the administration of the provincial organs. The monthly expenses of the provincial government will be reduced to 24,000 yuan, including the budget of 10,000 yuan for the guard battalion. The budget of each department will start from a minimum of 6,000 yuan and a maximum of 9,000 yuan. After the Department of Industry is abolished, it will be incorporated into the Department of Construction. The provincial treasury will only save more than 2,000 yuan per month. Implementing joint office can still reduce personnel and save about 10% of expenditures. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Preparing to Move to Baoding</h3>

Regarding the conflict between the teams of Yushimo in the war zone in Yutian, Chai Shan, Yi Wo, Tanaka, and the two commissioners Yin and Tao once negotiated to transfer the security team in the war zone out of the war zone for reorganization. The provincial government believes that this is a fundamental issue and is currently making this plan. The newly compiled security team has entered the war zone with only weapons and has not yet decided. It can be realized sooner or later. (Central News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>張羣蒞平敦促　黄郛就内長職</h3>
<h3>在平小駐卽赴定縣視察</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, arrived in Beiping from Nanjing at 10:24 a.m. yesterday (the 26th) on the order of Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan. Mrs. Shen Jingying, wife of Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, greeted him at the station on behalf of Mr. Huang. The representatives of various organizations who came to welcome him included Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Gao Shengyue, Director of the Third Division of the Military Branch Association, Xu Ying, head of the group, Yuan Liang, Mayor of Beiping, Jiang Xiaoxian, Commander of the Third Regiment of the Central Military Police, and others. The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a band to play music at the station to pay respect. After Zhang got off the train, Mrs. Huang first expressed her condolences, and Zhang thanked her repeatedly. Then he greeted Yin Tong, Yuan Liang, Jiang Xiaoxian, and others one by one, and then received news reporters in the first-class waiting room. According to him: (1) When I was in Nanjing, President Wang asked me to take the opportunity to return to Hankou to visit Chairman Huang and represent the central government to urge Mr. Huang to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to take up the post of Minister of the Interior; (2) The rural land administration inspection group recently organized in Hubei Province went north yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday) to Ding County to investigate civilian education, so I also plan to take the opportunity to visit there; (3) The traces of bandits in the border area of Hubei and Anhui have disappeared. The Jiangxi bandits who fled to the border area of Hunan and Guizhou are now being blocked and pursued by the central army. The bandits are already exhausted from this long journey and have lost their social base, so it is very easy to annihilate them; (4) When I was in Nanjing, I met with Minister He (Yingqin). He did not mention when he would return north. After Zhang finished speaking, he took a car with Yin Tong and others to the East Building of the Political Reorganization Committee to visit Chairman Huang. Huang also hosted a banquet for Zhang to wash the dust. Yin Tong and others were invited to accompany him. After the banquet, Huang and Zhang had a long talk until dusk, when Zhang left and returned to his residence on Dajiafang Hutong to rest and receive visiting relatives and friends. At 10 a.m. this morning (the 27th), Chairman Huang went to return the visit and continued the long talk for an hour. Huang then returned to the meeting to work. At noon, Zhang went to the banquet held by Yin Tong in Dongzongbu Hutong. It ended at 2 p.m. Leaders of the Military Branch Association, Political Reorganization Committee, Beiping Municipal Government, and Beining Railway Bureau and other organizations held a public banquet for Zhang at Dajiafang Hutong at 6 p.m. tonight. Chairman Huang also personally attended and mingled with the guests until about 8 p.m., when the host and guests dispersed happily. According to sources, although Mr. Zhang originally planned to stay in Beiping for two days, then leave Beiping to inspect Ding County, and then take a train back south, because Zhang's relatives and friends insisted on staying for a short visit, it is difficult to refuse their kindness, so there may be some changes at that time. Another news said that Mr. Zhang will stay in Beiping for a considerable period of time, but according to reporters' inquiries with powerful parties, it is said that Mr. Zhang's mission to Beiping has been completed and he will leave Beiping for Ding County at 11 p.m. tomorrow (the 28th).

After the opening, public stocks and other industrial stocks were bought in, and US steel stocks rose by about one pound. Although New York gas stocks fell by 125 at the opening, they rose by half a pound due to good demand. Automobile stocks were also bought in, and the buying trend of railway stocks also recovered slightly. On the whole, the stock market is very active and the transaction is still strong. The popularity is very good, but it is feared that this rising trend may not last long within this year. It is expected that after the tax avoidance sales trend has passed after the new year, and investment requirements reappear, the stock market will be even better at that time. According to the report of Hesheng Foreign Firm, it is expected that the trend of the stock market today will depend on the strength of the tax avoidance sales trend. The factors that are conducive to the market situation before the opening are (1) the market popularity is still very good, (2) the year-end activities of major industries have very satisfactory performances, (3) it is expected that investment requirements will soon be revived, and the factors that are unfavorable to the market situation are (1) the tax avoidance sales trend is still not over, although limited, (2) cash transactions will still be a force that hinders the development of the stock market.

<h3>昨日公債交割期　洋拆漲至六角</h3>
<h3>卽將回縮與銀問題無關</h3>
<h3>華商庫存充實金融穏定</h3>
<p>China News Agency said that since the Bank of China announced the truth about the inventory of Chinese and foreign banks in the city, the society has greatly understood the abundant silver reserves of Chinese banks, so the financial situation in the market yesterday was very stable. However, foreign exchange rates rose to six corners due to the public debt realization at the end of the year, but it has nothing to do with the silver problem. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>洋拆突漲無關白銀</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening and closing prices for foreign exchange were six corners, a sudden increase of two corners compared to the previous day. The public did not understand the truth and panicked, mistakenly believing that it was related to the silver problem. The China News Agency reporter visited Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to him, today's soaring foreign exchange rate, which suddenly reached six corners, is a rare phenomenon in recent times, but it has nothing to do with the silver problem. As for the reason for the soaring, it is because yesterday was the last delivery date for this year's public debt. The public debt made by the silver and money industries must be realized and closed, so the demand for cash in the market has increased sharply, and the foreign exchange rate has risen accordingly. It is expected that it will shrink back tomorrow (that is, today).</p>
<h3>退稅免稅　尚未决定</h3>
<p>The China News Agency reporter also learned from a major bank that the silver problem in the city, since the Bank of China announced the actual number of silver reserves in Chinese and foreign banks in the city, the society has fully understood the abundant silver reserves of Chinese banks in the city. As for the proposal to the Ministry of Finance by the silver and money industry in the city to release 10 million yuan to stabilize the financial situation, it has been adopted by the Ministry of Finance. As for the proposal by various economists to return silver tax for imported silver and exempt tax for re-exported silver, the Ministry of Finance is still considering it and has not decided whether to reject or adopt it.</p>
<h3>我國民間存銀　約計二十億元</h3>
<h3>减低幣值在事實上絕不可能</h3>
<h3>金融界力助政府謀穏定金融</h3>
<p>New News Agency said that regarding the silver problem, after repeated solemn clarification of rumors by various government authorities, the Silver and Money Industries Association of the city also did its best to assist the government in stabilizing the financial situation in the city. Therefore, the financial market in the city was greatly stabilized and rumors subsided immediately. Pan Yangyaoqun, from the Four Banks Preparation Treasury, told the New News Agency reporter yesterday morning that the saying of reducing the fineness of silver coins is purely a speculation of some nervous people and will never be put into practice. It is estimated that there are about 2 billion yuan of silver in the hands of the people in our country, and about 300 million yuan of silver in the banks in the city. If the government wants to reduce the fineness of silver coins, it must first seek to concentrate the silver in the hands of the people. Ask any ordinary people, knowing that the government wants to reduce the fineness of silver coins, will they willingly offer their silver? Moreover, our country cannot be compared with other countries. There has always been a lack of control over domestic silver. Even if the government wants to collect it, it is impossible to do so. If it is said that the government can first reduce the fineness of silver stored in banks in Shanghai, then we will not mention whether this policy can be implemented. Assuming that the fineness of silver stored in banks in Shanghai has been reduced by 80%, then this 300 million yuan of silver can only be converted to 60 to 70 million yuan at most. Not only will it not benefit the government, but at that time, the people's hearts in the society will become more uneasy. How can the government implement this kind of policy that is not worth the loss? Based on the above points, it is clear whether it is possible to implement the reduction of the fineness of silver coins. Recently, when the leaders of the banking industry have been meeting, they have been worried about the various nervous speculations that arise from the unclear minds of the outside world. They all hope that the financial industry will recognize the facts, deal with them calmly, and work together to help the government stabilize the financial situation. Then the hearts of the people in the society will naturally become more stable day by day.</p>
<h3>中央等三銀行　昨日開始放欵</h3>
<h3>申請登記借欵五六十家</h3>
<h3>核准撥借者三百四十萬</h3>
<h3>昨已領去二百四十一萬</h3>
<p>New News Agency said that the Silver and Money Industries Association, in order to stabilize the financial situation in the city, decided after days of deliberation that the Central, China, and Communications Banks would jointly allocate 10 million yuan in cash to lend to banks and money shops with tighter cash flow for temporary mortgage adjustments. The detailed measures for this loan have been agreed upon and have been started yesterday. About 50 to 60 banks and money shops went to the Central Bank to register for loans. The actual amount received yesterday was 2.41 million yuan. The details obtained by the New News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<h3>决定放欵　調劑市面</h3>
<p>The total amount of silver in Shanghai is estimated by the banking industry to be about 300 million yuan, and the reserves of various banks and money shops are very sufficient. However, the Silver and Money Industries Association, as a preparation organization for the two industries, has most of its preparation assets in the form of deed properties and marketable securities. In order to adjust the industrial and commercial businesses, it has specially requested the Central China Communications Bank to prepare a joint loan to the banks and money shops for temporary mortgage adjustments. When the cash flow eases in the spring, the mortgage will be stopped at any time.</p>
<h3>各方要求提早實行</h3>
<p>After the aforementioned plan was agreed upon by the Silver and Money Industries Association, it was once held at the Central Bank with the authorities of the Central China Communications Bank a few days ago, and it was decided to temporarily set 10 million yuan as the standard. The Central Bank will be responsible for two-quarters of the amount, and China Communications will each recognize one-quarter of the amount. If the amount required exceeds this fixed amount in the future, it can be increased at any time. The allocation of funds is entrusted to the Central Bank, and President Kong Xiangxi of the Central Bank has instructed Xi Demao, General Manager of the Business Bureau of the Bank, to be responsible for handling it. After the agreement was reached, it was originally planned to be implemented close to the lunar new year, but because all parties requested to implement it as soon as possible, a meeting was held again the night before yesterday and it was decided to start allocating funds yesterday.</p>
<h3>限制借欵　每戸十萬</h3>
<p>From 10:00 am to 11:00 am yesterday, representatives of the Silver and Money Industries Association and the authorities of the Central China Communications Bank met at the Central Bank on the Bund to discuss the loan measures. It was decided that in order to be universal and restrict manipulation, the banks and money shops that have registered to request a mortgage loan of cash are limited to a maximum of 100,000 yuan per household. The interest on the loan varies with the market price, but it is stipulated that it will be settled every three days.</p>

<p>On the third page, mid-section: Indignation Unleashed: Using a Small Iron Hammer, He Struck Mr. He in the Temple, Resulting in His Death. Afterwards, the French Concession Police Detained Mr. Liu and Sent Him to the Second Special District Court for Trial. The Circumstances Have Been Reported Previously. Yesterday, Judge Cheng Chaozu Proposed Continuing the Trial at the First Criminal Court. First, the witness, the defendant's nephew, Yang Lanchun, testified that he was fifteen years old and had been living in his aunt's house for over a year. That night at eight o'clock, the deceased first ordered me to go out and buy wine, and we drank together after I returned. Later, he asked me to fetch water. After a while, my uncle, Liu Baoyou, came home and argued with the deceased, and then started fighting. I don't know the details. The official asked if He Shifa came often, and I replied that he did. He then asked if there was any adultery, and I replied that I didn't know, but they did fight sometimes. According to the attorney representing He Gengshi, the deceased's wife, the defendant had premeditated murder, which can be proven by Dai Yuzhen, who lived in the same residence. The official immediately summoned Dai Yuzhen to the court, and she testified that she lived on the third floor of 29 Maggie Lane, in the back building, while the defendant and his wife lived in the front building. That night, she heard He Shifa arrive first, and then Liu Baoyou came later. Liu wanted to buy wine, but He said he didn't drink wine. She also heard Mrs. Liu Yang say that the rice was finished, and the deceased said that he would buy five pecks of rice tomorrow. Liu Baoyou then said, "Then I'll invite you to eat dumplings tomorrow." Soon after, she heard a fight. The official asked if He Shifa came often, and she replied that he did. He then asked if He and Liu's wife had committed adultery, and she replied that she lived in the back room, separated by a wooden partition, so she didn't know the details, but she often heard them laughing and talking. The defendant, Liu Baoyou, testified that on that night, the deceased was indeed having an affair with his wife. When he came home and knocked on the door, the deceased cursed him and told him to get out. Therefore, he, the common person, was furious and committed the crime. The testimony of Dai Yuzhen is inconsistent. The official ordered the debate to begin. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the police department argued that the defendant committed the crime in a moment of anger. The presiding judge has already investigated and confirmed that he cannot escape the charge of causing death by injury. However, there is insufficient evidence to prove premeditated murder. He requested a judgment. Subsequently, Attorney Yang Shaopeng, appointed by the court to defend the defendant, argued for a lighter sentence. The attorney representing the deceased's wife argued that the defendant premeditated murder after failing to borrow money and requested that he be severely punished according to the law, along with a private claim for damages of over 11,500 yuan. The court declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for the 31st. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Gambling on Ships by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Yesterday, all ship owners were ordered to comply</p>
<p>Violators will be immediately dismissed</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe ship has been out of service since the robbery. The company recently received a letter from passenger Wang Youming, stating that during the robbery, he hid under his bed and secretly hid his valuables and cash to avoid being robbed. His location was opposite the room of the ship's security police, so it was clearly visible. If the security police had been prepared, these dozen or so pirates with incomplete firearms could have been captured, and the passengers would not have suffered such a great loss, and the crew would not have been kidnapped. However, after the ship set sail, the security police gathered to play mahjong and were unprepared, neglecting their duties, which allowed the pirates to search and rob at will. The six security police officers' sharp firearms were easily seized by the pirates, allowing them to search and rob at will, and to kidnap the crew for ransom. As a result, the passenger's money and valuables were still stolen. After receiving this report, Liu Hongsheng first ordered the Shantou branch to investigate the passenger and then ordered the shipping department to investigate whether the security police were gambling. Mr. Liu ordered the shipping department to issue an order that from now on, regardless of whether the ships have set sail or not, gambling is prohibited by the security police and crew members. If such incidents occur again, the ship owner must report it and immediately dismiss the offenders. If there is any concealment, the ship owner will also be punished. The security police must also practice when they have free time and be vigilant at all times after the ship sets sail.</p>
<h3>National Goods Showcase Competition</h3>
<p>Twenty-three showcases have already been set up</p>
<p>Kai Lin's display breaks old patterns and creates new ones</p>
<p>The National Goods Showcase Display Competition, aimed at enhancing the art of showcase arrangement, has been held at the Huamei Tobacco Company's store on Nanjing Road since the first participation of the Yabu'er Factory in June. The Kai Lin Paint Company is currently displaying its work, making a total of twenty participating companies. Each company's display has its own unique features, and the commemorative gifts are practical and suitable for the season, leaving us with a very good impression. Kai Lin's current display, with its snow scene and white paint gifts, is both timely and practical, embodying the spirit of breaking old patterns and creating new ones.</p>
<p>Broadcasting to Celebrate the Victory Over the Communists is in Active Preparation</p>
<p>The national radio stations will also rebroadcast</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's broadcasting event to celebrate the victory over the Communists is scheduled to begin at 8:30 AM on January 3rd, broadcast by the China-West Drugstore radio station on Fourth Road. The broadcasting time will last for sixteen hours. Mayor Wu will hold the opening ceremony at 9:00 AM, and all the speakers will be famous figures from Shanghai's political, business, academic, and other circles. The entertainment program will also be very exciting, with content rarely heard on radio stations. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Government's purpose in organizing this broadcasting event to celebrate the victory over the Communists is to encourage the frontline soldiers to continue their efforts and to publicize the disaster of communism, so that the people can help the government's troops to eliminate it together. In the past, celebrations of the victory over the Communists have only been held in one area, and most people have not been able to understand the true meaning of the celebrations. Currently, there are more than 500,000 radios in the country, according to customs import statistics. If broadcasting is used to celebrate, at least ten times more people will listen, which is broader than celebrating in one place. Therefore, in addition to sending letters to the Central Radio Station and Shanghai's radio stations to rebroadcast, the municipal government is also sending letters to the International Telecommunications Bureau to temporarily suspend the broadcasting of interfering radio stations, and to send letters to the radio stations of various provinces to broadcast at the same time in order to expand publicity. In terms of music and singing, in addition to Hu Die, there will also be Xuan Jinglin and Yan Gongshang.</p>
<p>Quiet and Safe Women's Dormitory Sees Enthusiastic Reservations</p>

Ms. Yan and others praised the dormitory's facilities and offered various suggestions. It is said that the opening ceremony of the dormitory will feature Mrs. Cai Yuanpei performing the unveiling ceremony and inviting people from all walks of life to visit, which will be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The Film Yearbook Will Be Published Soon</p>
<p>The China Educational Film Association, recognizing that Chinese films have been developing rapidly but lacking reference materials for improvement, has passed a resolution to compile a Chinese Film Yearbook. A film editorial committee has been established, with Mr. Chen Lifu as the chief editor, and Pan Gongzhan, Wang Pingling, Li Jiaxiang, Li Jingbi, Dai Ce, Zhang Changren, Lu Shibai, and others as editors. Domestic film experts and artists such as Hong Shen, Sun Yu, Bu Wancang, Cheng Bugao, Wu Cun, Xu Beihong, Zong Baihua, Xie Shou Kang, Guo Youshou, Xu Xiacun, Yao Su Feng, Zhou Shixun, and more than forty others have been recruited as special contributors. It has taken eight months to compile the book, which is divided into sections such as general discussion, special discussion, historical facts, film censorship, film administration, film business, statistics, and surveys, totaling two million words. Biographies and recent photos of domestic film stars, as well as brief histories of film workers, are all listed. There are more than one hundred pages of film stills, making it an unprecedented creation in Chinese film culture and the latest compilation of world film culture. The entire book has over one thousand pages, with exquisite binding and a gold-stamped cover designed by Zhang Guangyu, a famous Chinese book designer. In order to popularize film knowledge, the association has set the price at five yuan, with a pre-order price of only two yuan and eighty cents.</p>

<p>Starting from January 4, 1935</p>
<p>Recently, the China Tongshang Bank has noted that social events are becoming more frequent, and the need for gift certificates is increasing for weddings, funerals, and social gatherings.

<p>Shen Bao Circulation Library's New Year Book Borrowing Arrangements</p>
<p>Book borrowing will still be available in the morning during the three-day New Year holiday</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shen Bao Circulation Library (3rd floor, Mainland Commercial Center, Nanjing Road) has been deeply loved by readers. The library not only provides various books for free but also considers the needs of readers in every way, such as establishing a "Reading Guidance Department" to answer various questions about books for readers and adding a "Postal Loan Department" to meet the needs of people outside the city. Therefore, although it has only been two years, the library has achieved considerable success. It is now known that the library will be closed for three days from January 1st to 3rd next year, as usual. However, to facilitate readers, book borrowing and returning will still be available from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day during the holiday period, and the reading room will also be open at the same time, allowing readers to read various newspapers and magazines as usual.

Matters reported included a detailed account of the rent reduction dispute between various members and their landlords. The meeting then discussed the following motions: (1) Although the members have won the rent reduction lawsuits against their landlords, should they appeal again? It was resolved that the amount of the court's judgment was too small and that they should appeal again and would not give up until they achieved their goal of a 70% reduction. (2) How should the funds for the appeal be raised? It was resolved that each member would bear an equal share. (3) How should the association improve its operations? It was resolved that from now on, all tenants inside and outside the area would be solicited to participate in the rent reduction movement in order to achieve the final victory of coexistence and co-prosperity. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

Just add it to boiling water and mix it (add a little sugar), and it will dissolve immediately. The taste is extremely sweet and delicious, and it does not have the regret of ordinary protein preparations causing constipation after prolonged use.

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, In today's local news section of your newspaper, there is an article about our Bureau's large dredging machine boat, which states that the cost of the boat is 22.5 million yuan in national currency. This is not true. The cost of the boat is approximately 2.5 million yuan in national currency. We are afraid that this misinformation will spread, so we are writing to correct it. We hope you will publish this letter in the letters to the editor section to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Shanghai Dredging Bureau, December 28, 1934.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in your newspaper's news column entitled "Opening of the Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition on New Year's Day," which stated that the following national goods factories had registered to participate: Guanshengyuan, Family Industrial Society, Tianchu MSG Factory, National Goods Company, Tianyiwei Mother Factory, Taikang Food Company, Sanyou Industrial Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, China Chemical Industrial Society, Yabu'er Electric Appliance Factory, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Underwear Company, China Enamel Company, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, etc. I was very surprised to read this. Our factories did not register to participate in the Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition because it is the end of the year and we are short of staff. The information in the newspaper must be based on inaccurate rumors. Therefore, we are writing to clarify and hope that you will make a correction to reflect the actual situation. Sincerely, Yabu'er Electric Appliance Factory, Shanghai Tianyiwei Mother Factory, Sanyou Industrial Society, Taikang Food Company, Guanshengyuan Food Company, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Family Industrial Society, Tianchu MSG Factory, China Chemical Industrial Society, December 28.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, We have read a news item in your newspaper's local news column of the 27th of this month, entitled "Lu Yaoming, Principal of the Datong Trust Bank Correspondence School, Accused of Fraud by Students," which mentioned our clients Wang Xingsheng, Wang Xingfu, and Wang Xingnan. This is not consistent with the facts. We are now recording the facts and respectfully requesting that you correct them. Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xingnan registered for admission to the Datong Trust Bank Correspondence School on Museum Road on February 10 of this year and paid a tuition fee of 32 yuan to Sun Bingzhong, the school's administrative director, who gave them a receipt. Lu Yaoming, the principal of the school, personally gave them more than 30 mimeographed lecture notes and promised to exchange them for letterpress lecture notes in a short time. However, after several months, they were not given the lecture notes. Wang Xingsheng and others sent letters to the Education Bureau and the school's school board members reporting the facts of their studies at the school, which aroused the principal's anger. He did not recognize them as students and even posted a reward for their arrest to vent his anger. Therefore, Wang Xingsheng and others entrusted our lawyer to publish a warning in the newspaper and separately filed lawsuits with the Education Bureau and the court, requesting legal relief. On December 11, the Special First Court opened a trial. Wang Xingsheng explained the situation and presented the evidence. At the continued hearing on the 24th of this month, the plaintiff Wang Xingsheng was slightly late in attending the court due to an obstacle that occurred along the way, and the court rescheduled the hearing for January 8. However, the principal Lu Yaoming accused the plaintiffs Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xingnan of being instigated by Xi Yuehan, the principal of the Chengxin Trust Bank Correspondence School, and claimed that they were not present because they were lying. This is not true. The plaintiffs sought relief from the Education Bureau and the court because they were harmed by the principal. This has nothing to do with the Chengxin Trust Bank Correspondence School. Therefore, we are writing to request that your newspaper make a correction to avoid misleading the public. Sincerely, Lawyer Peng Qixiu, December 28.</p>

<p>Episode 7: Hearing Words, She Conceals Her Tears; Baoshen Relates Her Bitter Experiences. Eagerly Seeking Invitations, He Is Ardently Trusting.</p>
<p>As long as the two months' worth of taxes are paid to the superiors in full, the official duties are considered to be well handled. Managing the automobiles is even easier. How many tickets are sold each day, how much money is collected? Is there anything he doesn't understand? Jia Duocai didn't even consider it and said with a smile, "You only want to do such things? Your goals are too small. I think it won't be difficult, will it? But how much salary can you get? At most twenty or thirty yuan." Li Tulian took a puff of his cigarette, shook his head with a smile, and said, "To muddle through an official position, one can't just look at the salary to see if it's good or bad. As long as you, old brother, are willing to help me, I won't dare to hope for much. Even such a small thing would be enough." As he spoke, he straightened his sleeves and made more than a dozen bows. He kept saying, "Please, please." Jia Duocai said, "Every now and then, if I meet Director Gao, I will definitely mention you." When Li Shilian heard this, he bowed again. He thought that he had unintentionally found a way to seek an official position. Jia Duocai was like a god of wealth, and he must not offend him. He had made a small joke today, so he should stay and talk with him more, and then invite him out for a small treat. So he sat there and didn't leave, just rambling on. Jia Duocai couldn't bear it any longer. Relying on the fact that they were acquaintances, he smiled twice. He put his hand on the edge of the table and kept tapping with his fingers. He was looking up at the floor, naturally thinking about something funny. Li Shilian said, "Brother Duocai, do you laugh at me for seeking an official position from afar with such small goals?" Jia Duocai shook his head twice, still thinking for a long time, then laughed with a "Puchi" sound. Li Shilian stood up and clapped his hands, saying, "I understand. You must be thinking about that little fellow." Jia Duocai said with a smile, "Isn't this called 'good things take time'? If it weren't for these two foreigners visiting, our matter would be seven or eight tenths of the way there." Li Shilian also stamped his foot and said, "If I had known that these two foreigners were here to cause trouble, I wouldn't have come. This is really a big letdown." But he wasn't leaving Xi'an after all. Sooner or later, you'll get what you want. What's the rush? (102)</p>
<p>Royal Fragrance Drifting Records by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Especially because I usually received quite a bit of favor from the Empress Dowager, I couldn't help but feel particularly flustered when I received this reprimand. At that time, I could only kowtow to her and beg for forgiveness. But her anger couldn't be eliminated immediately. She solemnly reprimanded me as if she were expressing some important political view, saying:</p>
<p>(You are too bold, child! Can't you think carefully? How could such a great and powerful immortal not know the condition of each patient and give them the right medicine? When have you ever seen him cause any trouble? You're really talking nonsense without knowing the importance of things!)</p>
<p>But she didn't just scold me. She was also worried about me and urged me to quickly kowtow to the immortal and apologize: as if if I didn't go to kowtow and apologize immediately, the immortal would definitely not easily forgive me, and some misfortune might befall me. Although I absolutely didn't believe that there were really such miraculous things in the world, in order to please the Empress Dowager, I followed her words and knelt very respectfully in front of the shrine, bowing carefully several times. When I got up, her anger was almost gone, but she still put on a very serious expression and said:</p>
<p>(The immortal's powers are truly incomparable! Not to mention ordinary illnesses, if you take his elixir, it will be effective immediately. Even if someone is suffering from the most terrible terminal illness, as long as they still have a breath of life left, the immortal can still save them! But their family members must come here sincerely, offer good incense, kowtow, and wait for the ashes that fall from the incense to not fall into the incense burner. They must catch it with their hands and take it back immediately, mix it with boiling water, and have the patient swallow it. Then, no matter how terrible the illness is, it can be cured! This is something we mortals cannot imagine!) (212)</p>
<p>Strange Clothing and Cumbersome Rituals by Li Yuyi</p>
<p>Strange is different from the ordinary. The strangeness of clothing, "strange clothes and exotic attire," is different from previous "strange clothes" and future ordinary attire. The strangeness of rituals, "tedious and elaborate rituals," is different from the current cumbersome rituals, as well as past or future ordinary rituals.</p>
<p>"Rituals" and "beauty" sometimes work together, and sometimes they stand in absolute opposition. Those who advocate using rituals to restrain the masses believe that strange clothing wastes money and hinders rituals; those who advocate using beauty to correct people's hearts believe that cumbersome rituals are just empty formalities, and it is better to encourage and promote things like strange clothing and exotic attire, which are more real.</p>
<p>In fact, when you go to a store in the North, as soon as you enter, the shopkeeper will bow to you and invite you to sit down, with polite and respectful behavior, which has a great promotional effect on his business. But this doesn't work in Shanghai. A department store in Shanghai is so busy that there isn't even time to haggle over prices. If they also bowed and invited you to sit down, they wouldn't be able to do any business all day.</p>
<p>But in Shanghai, strange clothing and exotic attire have a great role to play. The more bizarre the decoration, the more it can be used as commercial advertising, which is a tremendous force in boosting the economy and stimulating financial activity. This wouldn't work in the inland towns. If a woman dresses a little strangely, she will be scolded. Shops there only have honest commerce. The usefulness of strange clothing is very small. However,</p>

<p>Local Supplement of Shen Bao, Special Film Issue</p>
<p>Lessons Learned by English Novelist Hugh Walpole from Screenwriting</p>
<p>By Chen Xiong</p>
<p>Many acknowledge the close relationship between literature and film, but there are differences between literary writers and screenwriters. Literary writers stand at a high position, admired and loved by many; screenwriters not only lack the prestige of literary writers, but are also hardly known in society except among film industry colleagues. Therefore, although many literary works are adapted for the screen, literary writers rarely write directly for the screen.</p>
<p>Recently, the film industry seems to be tinged with literary color. Perhaps this trend is temporary, following the moral reform movement in the American film industry. However, the large-scale adaptation of literary works for the screen shows that literature and film are gradually becoming closer than before. Under this trend of the screen leaning towards literature, many literary writers are found writing directly for the screen, or simply becoming screenwriters. An example is H.G. Wells, the author of "The Outline of History," who has joined the scriptwriting team of a London film company. Hugh Walpole, a British novelist of the same generation as Wells, was also hired by MGM in the United States and went to Hollywood several months ago to work as a screenwriter.</p>
<p>In addition to being a screenwriter at MGM, Walpole is also supervising the production of MGM's adaptation of Dickens' famous novel "David Copperfield." MGM, seeing the popularity of literary films such as "Little Women," is undertaking the production of two great literary films: one is Stevenson's "Treasure Island," which premiered in Nanjing a few days ago, and the other is "David Copperfield." For the sake of caution, MGM spared no expense to bring Walpole from England to supervise the production, because Walpole is now the only expert in England who knows Dickens' life and works, and is also the chairman of the Dickens Fellowship.</p>
<p>Walpole is not a stranger to American readers. He has visited the United States several times to lecture in various places. His twenty-five novels have been translated into various languages. Therefore, he is indeed one of the most prolific and voluminous novelists in the world of literature. After arriving in Hollywood, he wrote something within a few days, and according to his novel writing methods, what he wrote here was the best. Who knew that when his piece was submitted to the MGM script department, someone wrote a big "inferior" across the front. When Walpole saw his article being criticized like this, he could of course get angry immediately, and in the manner of a literary writer, immediately resign to MGM or sue them for insult.</p>
<p>For thirty years, Walpole has maintained the dignity of a novelist, and none of his works dared to be criticized or modified. Who knew that upon arriving in Hollywood, he would have to endure this kind of treatment for nothing. However, Walpole knew that film was not his forte, and MGM treated him well in every way, so he would rather endure a moment of humiliation and receive the so-called secrets of film literature.</p>
<p>This secret is that he cannot write screenplays in the same way as writing novels; writing novels is for the mind to read, and writing screenplays is for the eyes to read. When writing screenplays, the author must be able to "see" what he is writing; novels can be lengthy, but screenplays must be concise, using simple words for the actors to act, and also to give them dialogue.</p>
<p>Walpole originally planned to stay in Hollywood for two weeks to finish the job and return to England. He thought that writing a novel was a very difficult task, but he did not expect that writing a screenplay would take so long and the work would be so difficult. Now Walpole has finished the script for "David Copperfield." After this film is completed, he plans to use his experience in Hollywood to write a screenplay directly for the screen, because he feels that writing for the screen is much more interesting than writing novels.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>A Review of Great Expectations</h3>
<p>By Ling He</p>
<p>Regarding the original author, Charles Dickens, it seems unnecessary for me to introduce his works, as many have been translated into Chinese. Now, I just want to briefly talk about "Great Expectations."</p>
<p>In this story, Dickens, as a realist writer, still felt a great interest in themes such as revenge, which romantic writers enjoyed depicting. The personality of the character Magwitch is indeed very moving in various aspects of revenge or loyalty.</p>
<p>Here, the original author opposes the restraint and conservatism of 19th-century English women, and at the same time, he gives great sympathy to the male protagonist who came from a blacksmith background. Naturally, we will not ignore the several mentions in the dialogue that the blacksmith became a gentleman and the female prisoner became a Lady, so the male and female protagonists were united in the comforting voices of the prisoner at his deathbed. Similarly, the author expresses great sympathy for the cruel experiences of the prisoner Magwitch, but what the author expresses here is that the prisoner strives to move upward: he escapes from prison, he opens a mine to make money, and he spends money to send the young man from a blacksmith background to study and become a gentleman. This is precisely the positive expression of Dickens as a reformer of the time, which is expressed in all aspects of "Great Expectations."</p>
<p>Adapting literary works or dramas from previous eras has now become a major trend. However, when film writers choose literary works, they will never blindly adopt them, but must be suitable for the film writer's concept and further consider whether certain literary works are still beneficial to the common interests of their group. Therefore, Dickens' works have now been adapted for the screen. So here, we point out that the intrinsic value of the work and its current screening significance are very necessary.</p>
<p>In terms of the expression methods of the film "Great Expectations," it will naturally not easily point out shortcomings to us. The whole thing is a mature expression of film art. Whether it is individual acting or directing and screenwriting, there are excellent achievements, but this is very focused on maintaining the seriousness of literary films, and it lacks the strong light and fun that is currently popular.</p>
<h3>A Review of Thirteen Women</h3>
<p>By You Jing</p>
<p>Thirteen Women screening in Shanghai</p>
<p>Absurd, vulgar, superficial, boring... This film may have set the highest record as the finale of 1934. If you don't believe me, then let's see:</p>
<p>It is said that Miss Ursula, a mixed-race child born to a white father and a Javanese mother, has a vicious and cruel heart in her beautiful appearance, so she cannot get along with her classmates. She works as an assistant under the hypnotist and prophet Swami, using the psychology of suspicion and jealousy common to women to write twelve letters in Swami's name and send them to her twelve former female classmates, predicting that each person will suffer various tragic misfortunes.</p>
<p>On the screen, it starts with her imitation signature, followed by the post office spreading it out.</p>
<p>Miss Mei died after falling during a circus performance. Xiao Qiong went crazy. According to the description, there is also Miss Mary who went crazy, and Mrs. Hailshire who committed a crime and went to jail, but none of them were seen on the screen. After many fragments were shown intermittently, then the play began to unfold.</p>
<p>The letter received by Laura said that her son would die after his sixth birthday. Laura invited Helen to discuss it. Coincidentally, Helen was traveling with Ursula on the train and was bewitched by Ursula and committed suicide in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>The plot follows these chaotic and discontinuous film strips and absurd and bizarre events into the detective aspect. But surprisingly, the motive of this detective is not based on Helen's suicide and Ursula's theft of jewelry after her death, but on Laura's commission. At this time, in order to realize her prophecy, Ursula asked the driver to send a bomb as a birthday gift for Laura's son. Coincidentally, Laura took the gift, not knowing it was dangerous, and got into the driver's car. The detective chased after them, the bomb exploded, and the driver was arrested. The secret between Ursula and the driver was discovered. She was forced to jump off the train to New York by the detective and committed suicide. Several times, newspaper inserts were used to explain the suicide, murder of husband, going crazy, and imprisonment of other women.</p>
<p>In addition, it is ridiculous to regard Ursula's own inevitable death as a sermon of "evil has its reward."</p>
<p>Special Film Advertising Studies</p>
<p>By Fu</p>
<p>Before "Sadie McKee" was released, many rooms in New York hotels suddenly found a piece of paper with the words "Sadie McKee Visited, Not Met" written on it. It was a woman's handwriting and was written on a note, with the following note: "Please call Trinity 7141." Sure enough, the phone at Trinity 7141 kept ringing, and the switchboard girls told them one by one, "Sadie McKee is the name of Joan Crawford's new film. Please be sure to come when it is released..." Recently, before "The Merry Widow" was released in New York, MGM's authorities first launched a (phrase writing competition) in various newspapers. Each letter of "The Merry Widow" was to be used to write one or two words to form a sentence. As a result, the following sentence won the first prize:</p>
<p>MAGNIFICENT EFFERVESCENT ROULICKING ROMANTIC YOUTHFUL With alits Memor able Delighfful OriginalWonlers</p>
<p>The meaning of the above sentence is just praising "The Merry Widow" for its unsurpassed splendor, without detailed translation.</p>
<p>The Nobility of "The Merry Widow"</p>
<p>By Yunmen</p>
<p>Ernst Lubitsch, America's first-class romantic comedy master, has now put his most proud "The Merry Widow" on the screen. "The Merry Widow," originally named Die Lustige Witwe, first appeared on the stage in Vienna, Austria, in early 1905, and achieved extraordinary success, which was a victory for Lubitsch's style. At the same time, this romantic, witty, and elegant comedy of song and dance also gained world recognition. At that time, Mitzi Günther, an Austrian actress, became famous for playing (the widow), and Louis Treumann, who played Count Danilo, jumped to stardom from then on.</p>
<p>MGM spent 500,000 pounds to produce this Continental Style classical musical comedy without hesitation, because every penny has its price. Then, the true value of "The Merry Widow" can be proved without proof. Therefore, when it was released in New York, the seat price had increased sharply, but the audience was still crowding like a tide and has not declined so far. What is even more valuable is that all the songs written by Lubitsch himself are completely preserved on the screen, and we can also get a glimpse of the whole picture. The musical instruments alone are worth millions of dollars. Among them, one violin is one of the three treasures of the world (Tchaikovsky's treasure), and there are many other antiques from hundreds of years ago. As for the dance program in the film, it was compiled by Albertina Rasch, and the songs were still created by Franz Lehár, a world-renowned composer. As for the technical background, mood, and dubbing, they are guaranteed by MGM's reputation.</p>
<p>"Regeneration Flower" Compilation</p>
<p>The filming of "Regeneration Flower" took a whole year, and the staff suffered a lot. It was unbearably hot to be locked in the studio during the hot days. Recently, when Hu Die played Xun Tao Ge'er, in order to grasp the mood of the plot, she used a large horsepower fan to blow at her, which was unbearably cold.</p>
<p>Xuan Jinglin, who played Grandma Zhao, acted so realistically in the scene where she was frightened by Qian Dashuai's soldiers that she got sick. Readers, did you know that she was (really acting) in that scene. She filmed while sick.</p>
<p>Director Zheng Lao Fuzi spent more brainpower on "Regeneration Flower" than on "Sister Flowers"! How to emphasize that the warlords in Regeneration Flower are more powerful than those in Sister Flowers, and the lives of civilians are more bloody. To avoid dullness, a paragraph of romance before Erbao was also introduced.</p>
<p>When Tao Ge'er Xiao Qiu was making "Regeneration Flower," he was both happy and anxious. He was happy that he was going to have a little Xiao Qiu, and he was anxious that in "Regeneration Flower," he was worried about Grandma Zhao's illness and the crying of the child Xiao Niu on the one hand, and wanted to go to do revolutionary work with Brother Li on the other. Of course, he was very anxious in this situation. This joy and anxiety made Xiao Qiu suffer.</p>

<p>Film Novel The Merry Widow (5)</p>
<p>By Su Hua</p>
<p>The music being played is exactly the same as last night's score. Inner understanding made them dance. Kissing, laughing, talking... They were intoxicated. The sound of leaves rustling rang behind them, and at the same time, someone hurried into the room. Danilo heard the ambassador's voice ordering someone to telegraph the King to report the success of their love. Then the ambassador received a telegram from the King saying: "Danilo has leaked the secret in Macy, and all countries know that he must immediately use swift means to stop the rumors, otherwise, if the widow hears this news, things will be bad, etc." This made the ambassador as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. After a while, he hurriedly looked for Danilo and Sonia. He publicly announced the news of their engagement. Sonia, confused, just wanted to ask Danilo, but Danilo chased the ambassador into the inner room. Inside, Danilo questioned the ambassador about what was going on. The ambassador handed him the telegram to read. After he finished reading it, he left without saying a word. He opened the door and saw Sonia. Her eyes were wet. He hugged her and said, "Sonia, there are some things I want to tell you." She immediately went to close the small window on the door. At that time, Danilo knew that she had heard everything the ambassador had said just now. "Do you have anything else to tell me?" "No." His voice was disappointed. He continued, "But I love you." He just wanted to hug her, but she pushed him away and said tremblingly, "You don't have to explain to me anymore. I understand. Everyone knows why you love me." As she left, she sobbed, "I believe you."</p>
<p>Danilo walked out with a bitter face, and the guests congratulated him. But he didn't say a word. Sonia watched him from a corner with tears on her face. He suddenly announced to the people, "The announced engagement news is a complete misunderstanding. I represent Miss Sonia in saying that she has no such intention at all." Sonia was extremely sad. Danilo approached her and said in a voice mixed with disappointment and sorrow, "The matter is over, there is nothing to say. I don't want any explanation, but before I leave you, I want to say one thing: 'Fifi, I love you.'" She was hurt in her heart, but she still forced a smile on her face and turned to dance with another group of men. Suddenly, she saw two Masurian officers walking in and saying to Danilo, "We are ordered by the King to arrest you." He was disarmed and escorted out of the embassy.</p>
<p>Because of this incident, Masuria was in an uproar. The palace was also restless. Everyone was worried about the financial collapse of the country. In the courtroom, there were so many people that it was impossible to move, especially women. Danilo was in the prisoner's stall. Ambassador Piff, the ambassador's secretary Macy, guests from the embassy, and Danilo's own servants were all in the witness stand. After a while, the judge stood up and said, "I accuse Captain of the Guard Danilo of treason, dereliction of duty, and endangering national interests due to misconduct." Suddenly, it seemed that someone was squeezing out from the crowd of onlookers. The judge showed a welcome face, and he saw Sonia walking up. She said to the judge, "He is not guilty. For the sake of the country, he deceived me. Don't convict him. He should be awarded a medal. He has exhausted all his tricks and told all his lies. He deceived me, using emotion and love to incite me. He obeyed orders and did not hesitate to crush a woman's heart." As she said this, Danilo struggled to stand up and said, "May the judge allow me to ask her a few questions?" The judge allowed him. Danilo stood up and walked over to Sonia and asked, "Did I deceive you?" "Yes," she answered affirmatively. "Was I joking with you?" he asked. "There was nothing but jokes," she answered. "When I danced with you, was I thinking of swindling your money?" "When you hugged me, were you also thinking about this?" "Were my actions planned?" "Yes," she answered affirmatively. "Then, when I kissed you?" "That was the biggest place you deceived me." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shantung Province River Works Weak</h3>
<p>(Tientsin) Yu Hsueh-chung discusses the aftermath of the Shantung Yellow River project. Due to insufficient funds and limited work, the newly built dikes are not strong. There is still a risk of breaches at any time. The Yongding River has not experienced flooding in five years. The coming spring and autumn flood seasons are expected to be a dangerous period. The provincial authorities, facing financial difficulties, cannot undertake permanent works. They can only intensify supervision of various river bureaus, blocking breaches to the east and west. This is also a regrettable matter for the provincial authorities. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Stamp Tax Revenue to Offset Local Financial Problems</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has instructed the finance departments of Kiangsu, Chekiang, Anhwei, and other provinces that, starting from November, 40% of the proceeds from the sale of stamps at post offices will be reserved for allocation to these provinces to offset the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. However, the amount and timing of the allocation should be based on the actual abolition situation in each province. It is now being investigated that the provincial donation tax supervision committees will soon be established. Regarding the first and second offsetting measures stipulated by the Presidential Order since July 1st of this year, whether each province has strictly complied, after the total amount of tobacco and alcohol license tax is returned to the province, whether the amount of increased tax is used to offset it first, and whether revenue and expenditure can be balanced, after the excessive and miscellaneous taxes have been abolished, whether there has been any disguised increase in the localities of each county, and how should the 30% stamp tax allocated to each county be distributed? The Ministry has repeatedly reported to the Ministry the amount of reduction and the various items to be reduced, and how they should be carried out. All these should be submitted to the donation tax supervision committee for review and reply, and then be reviewed and handled. The Ministry hopes that the internal and external will be mutually supportive, and the actual number of allocations must be credible and fruitful. However, the overall verification of name and reality is not afraid to seek details. Each supervisor committee member should adhere to their duties, have compassion, and strive to provide real benefits to the people and make practical achievements. This is what the Ministry hopes for. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guidance of the Huai River Joint Loan Items</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The 9 million yuan contract for the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity fund for the Guidance of the Huai River has been sent to Zhenjiang, where it will be signed by Acting Chairman Chen Guofu.

(28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Valuation of the Cotton and Wheat Loan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Four-fifths of the American cotton and wheat loan is used to purchase cotton, and one-fifth is used to purchase wheat and flour. The first batch of cotton and wheat was shipped from the United States in August of last year and handed over to the Economic Commission for distribution. Subsequently, there was a bumper harvest domestically, and both products were booming. The contract was then revised to purchase 15 million worth of cotton, 1 million worth of wheat, and 1 million worth of flour. The cotton, wheat, and flour that had already arrived in China were, in addition to allocating a portion to offset water conservancy wages, sold to domestic factories. The cash received was used for constructing highways and developing water conservancy projects, which achieved considerable results. The cotton and flour from the loan were shipped in August of this year. Only the last batch of 1,500 tons of wheat, packed in 100,000 bags, remains. It has already been loaded onto the Olimbu Ren cargo ship by the American company Debu on the 19th of this month and is en route without any stops. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of next month. After inspection, it will be transported to Tianjin for unloading. The cotton and wheat loan has now come to a complete end. The Economic Commission's office in the United States will also be closed, leaving only the formalities for repaying the debt. An expert estimated afterward that this debt was not very favorable to us. The market prices in the United States were not lower than those in our country, and the American ships raised freight rates, totaling the cost which was about 20% higher than the domestic wheat price. When selling off, it was discounted at the market price. Therefore, the amount of loss will reach 20-30% of the loan amount. (28th Dispatch)</p>
