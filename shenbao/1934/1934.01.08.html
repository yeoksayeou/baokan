<p>民國二十二年度過去十個月中。我國對外貿易。輸出總値計五萬萬零七百萬元。輸入總値計十一萬五千八百萬元。而輸入超過之數在此十個月中。已逾六萬五千一百萬元。在全國上下交困民窮財盡之秋。對外有形貿易之表示已如此。足徴我國國民經濟生活之窘迫。與今年年内恢復繁榮之不易矣。吾人再細考我國經濟結構之實際狀况。與國際經濟之關係。又知我國自與列强交往以來。始終爲原料輸出國家。因我國迄今尙未脫離農業國家之形態。故輸出物品之類别。恒以農業出產品或農業副產品居首位。製造品居下位。去年則一變以往之情形。製造品竟躍居第一。佔輸出數量百分之四十以上。驟視之似爲我國經濟組織之進步。至少亦爲我國大都市工業發逹之象徴。然而事實所趨。適得其反。去年有形貿易所以變更之原因。第一因東北四省被割。大豆及其他若干農物品。與鑛產原料之輸入。不復見於我中國對外輸出貿易之表册中。而交通比較便利之都市半製品與製造品。遂以越過農產品與原料而居首位。第二内地農村經濟。日趨崩壤。糧食市價。雖空前低落。但並非數量如何增加。食用如何有餘。不過受外來糧食之影響。市塲堆積難於消售而已。第三。世界經濟恐慌尙未眞確好轉。其消納原料。已極呆滯。其他消耗品更無待論。而我國出產之大宗如生絲如茶葉。皆因此感受莫大之困難。是以貿易上發生從前未有之變更也。</p>
<p>夫國際收支之平衡。不必盡賴有形貿易輸出入。以爲其國家經濟盛衰之表示。英吉利强盛之國也。在世界大戰前後。執世界金融之牛耳。爲工業國家之首班。近雖略見衰老。但仍不失爲大國。其有形貿易。年年輸入超過。依然無損於其富。印度窮國也。而其有形貿易之出超。亦年年繼續。乃非特於富無增。且日見其窮者。以一則有無形輸入。卽對外投資利息之收入。與夫船舶之收人爲挹注。一則輾轉被人剥削。卽外人投資利息之支付。較貿易出超額而過之。故英國猶可在世界經濟恐慌中勉强撑持。印度則愈加窮乏。我中國歷年以來。輸入超過甚巨。所以尙能支持國際間之經濟平衡者。非有對外投資之利息。亦非有船舶之收入以資彌補。不過僅恃海外華僑匯回國内之欵。每年約計在兩萬萬元左右。其次爲金銀之秘密輸出。數亦不少。然而現時之華僑經濟情况。日漸不佳。匯回欵項自必减少。金銀之秘密輸出。亦將因交通阻滯而漸次減小。則我國對外貿易輸入超過。遂顯露空前未有之危機矣。</p>
<p>鈏　代列强。受世界大戰以遠之實際敎訓。鑒於目前經濟戰爭市塲爭奪與軍備競賽之情勢。一力圖謀經濟聯盟之具體實現。英吉利旣已開其端序。一年以來。漸有基礎。美國先圖其國内之穏定以及於南美。日本以　爾小島。自兼併滿洲而後。亦力倡其所謂「日满」經濟聯盟。我國處此强隣環伺之下。具世界稀有之富源。設使能及時有爲。則自給自足之經濟形成。當亦不在當世任何先進國家之下也。倘若長此以往。不能自已開發。自已扶持則寗有不爲經濟鬭爭下之犠牲品者。吾人於閱讀輸入超過數逾六億五千萬元之數字。能不惕然自懼哉。</p>

<h3>二十二年份我國工商各業狀况</h3>
<p>棉紗麵粉絲繭各業日見衰落</p>
<p>僅火柴業日見發逹添十一家</p>
<p>民國二十二年度我國工商業狀况據國際貿易局發表者如次</p>
<p>棉紗</p>
<p>我國棉紗業、自民國二十年大水以來、每况愈下、二十二年情况、更趨惡化、其原因於農村經濟之衰落、人民購買力之薄弱、内地紗銷疲滯所致、而各地災禍戰亂、亦爲一大原因、歷年三月份棉紗交易、每日逹三四千包之賣出、去年則每日至多二三百包、甚至一百餘包、不景氣情狀、於此可見、至三月止、上海·天津·廣州·漢口·等埠存紗逹二十一萬餘包、約値三千七百九十餘萬元、因之存貨過多、價格狂跌、惟棉花則以國產供不應求、未呈此象、去年三月份之紗價、與十九年全年最低價比較、跌去二十四兩、所以各地紗廠虧折不支、華商紗廠聯合會爲消極救濟計、於四月底起實行減工、截至六月止、全國已完全停工之紗廠、已逹十一家、計紡綻三十四萬枚、停夜工者三廠、計十一萬枚、已占華廠總綻數中百分之十五、至八月份停綻者逹五十萬枚以上、</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>去年麵粉業、因粉銷呆滯、價格低賤、與棉紡業同樣衰落、麵粉業爲我國主要工業之一、工廠遍全國、以蘇省爲最發逹、銷塲則以北方爲大、東三省天津一帶、銷數更旺、東三省失陷後、已受一大打擊、去歲天津等埠、又因日俄麵粉之廉價傾、銷勢難立卽恢復、而南洋福州厦門一帶客商、都不敢購進、交易寥寥、次等麵粉、去年銷路幾全停、所以存貨堆積、上海一埠、至八月止、各廠家共存粉三百萬包、小麥三百二十萬担、行號浮存小麥六十五萬担、共計一千零七十萬包、無錫天津漢口等地存貨亦有二百萬包左右、各廠家因存貨堆積、遂於中秋節後宣布停工、後以工人生計問題、輪流開車、所以麵粉業之衰落、較勝於往年者數倍、</p>
<p>絲繭</p>
<p>去年我國絲業、仍陷於凋落狀態中、江浙缫絲廠本有一百八十餘家、絲車四萬八千餘部、去歲歲首、因日絲傾銷、人造絲競售、絲市益不振、二三兩月、絲廠開工者僅二十家許、六七月海外絲市大漲、於日繅絲廠開工者有一百餘家、絲車三萬餘部、此爲去年絲業最盛時期、七月以後、絲價步跌、一蹶不振、以致多數廠家、無力維持、又相率停工、至十月份初、上海絲廠開工者、又不及二十家、無錫二十五家、至十二月初、僅六家、繼卽全部停工、失業工人逹六十萬以上、絲業之衰落、於此可見、</p>
<p>茶葉</p>
<p>二十二年茶業市價、較二十一年又有減退、各地茶棧無形中又減少半數、而收買毛茶之商人、又受金融及歷年失敗影響、所以預定收買茶價、僅及二十一年之六七折、内銷雖減、而出口則較增百分之十以上、</p>
<p>其他</p>
<p>我國煤礦業藴藏共逹二一二·一一四·OOO·OOO噸、而每年產量僅二千五六百萬噸、僅及萬分之一、所以二十二年煤業、仍無進步、至於我國水泥業之產額、爲二百三十萬桶、而銷數則逹三百萬桶、七十萬桶數量、則仰給於外貨、以日貨爲多、火柴業則日見發逹、去年成立新廠者、逹十一家、增加商標逹九十二種、所以我國火柴工廠、現已有一百餘家、其他如像膠業等、去年營業狀况、均較往年有顯明之減退云、</p>

<p>=完成三大幹線=</p>
<p>該公司開辦之初、卽擬就三大幹線計劃、以期先行貫穿各省市之大商埠空中交通、然後再行逐步發展邊陲各省、完成全國航空網線、數年來該公司雖幾經困難、仍慘澹經營、致力於完成三大航線之工作、卒於去年一月十日滬平綫正式開航十一月十一日渝蓉綫開航、十月二十四日滬粤線開航、從此南北東西空中交通得相啣接、中外人士、交相稱便、其中渝蓉一綫、尤爲便利、蓋成都重慶間、水陸交通、十日方能逹到、目下祇需二小時之久、卽可到逹、</p>
<p>=試飛西南航線=</p>
<p>該公司自完成三大幹綫後、現爲发展全國航空事業、貫通湖北·廣西·雲南·四川·等省空中起見、特籌備由漢口·經長沙·龍州·昆明·而逹重慶之西南航綫、業於十一月三十日九時十五分、由該公司機航組主任聶開一·營業組主任黄寳賢·偕同機師安利生·由漢口乘坐十一號機出發試飛、於一日抵逹雲南、（昆明）當卽勾留該處察勘機塲、並接洽一切、一俟接洽就緒、日内卽由昆明繼續前進、公司方面、俟該綫試飛完成後、擬卽從事佈置沿綫各站、俾得早日開航、以利交通、</p>
<p>=訂購新式飛機=</p>
<p>該公司爲便利飛機起落、特在龍華飛機塲建築跑道二條外、現鑒於上海·漢口·重慶·成都·間商務繁盛、客郵異常發逹、爲求安穏舒適、縮短行程時間起見、擬於今年夏季、改用最新式之飛機行、該項飛機、業經進行籌備、其平均飛速度爲一百五十英里、（約四百五十華里）較現用之機更快三分之一、將來淸晨離上海、正午到漢口、當日下午、卽可將全部郵件送逹、次晨離漢、亦能於當日正午到成都、是則上海成都、不過兩日之行程、其在空中、僅需十小時而已、</p>
<p>=培植華籍人才=</p>
<p>該公司雖係中美合辦、其合同存在時間、僅十年、今已三年有餘、六年半後卽可满期、届時將由我國獨辦、但該公司開辦之初、駕駛機師及無綫電員、均僱用外籍人員、目前如無綫電一部、已由吾國人員擔任、其對於拆修飛機、間亦由吾國人員擔任、功效頗佳、六年半之期、轉瞬卽至、故對於培植人才、該公司尤爲注意、蓋將以備他年之用云、</p>

<h3>海長陳紹寛來滬談話</h3>
<p>閩省軍事及造船所狀况</p>
<p>國聞社云、海軍部長兼江南造船所所長陳紹寛氏、昨晨七時半、由京乘車抵滬、下車卽至高昌廟、海軍練隊司令陳訓泳·軍械處長羅儀成·均往晤、記者趨謁與談閩省軍事及江南造船所過去一年中情形頗詳、茲誌所談如次</p>
<p>福建軍情</p>
<p>陳氏首謂、閩省軍事、現正在激戰中、中央軍進展異常順利、延平業已佔領、自延平水道入福州、不過一天、自福州逆水到延平、需時三天、其間距離約二百數十里、故福州再經海軍由東壓迫、指顧可下、古田雖尙在閩軍手中、詳情未悉、但聞主力大戰、卽在該處開始、</p>
<p>沿海推進</p>
<p>陳氏又謂、李孟斌司令、現在長門、陳季良司令、仍駐三都、調度一切海軍各艦攻防事宜、長門早經收復、卽李司令所率各艦、亦已駛進馬江、至於沿海各縣、寗德全在海軍手、羅源僅一部歸海軍、陸戰隊現尙未越白鶴飛鸞兩嶺、如佔此二嶺、羅源無險可憑、而逆軍非撤出羅源不可、連江現尙由閩軍盤踞中、</p>
<p>馬尾開砲</p>
<p>談至此、記者詢以連江瀕處馬江北側、今連江尙在閩手、則海軍何由駛入馬江、陳答福州幅員遼闊、無異上海爲一總名稱、今以馬尾連江比之、儼與吳淞浦口相同、而連江深入内地、可與崑山蘇州無異、故其所隔尙遠、海艦駛進、並不受敵威脅、目下陣綫如何、則有關軍事、未容告君、馬尾海軍開砲轟敵、余（陳稱）未接電報、蓋昨日）卽前日）接獲長門李司令來電、尙未言及海軍開砲之事、總之、依今日狀况、福州之下、實不成問題、所有祇時間耳</p>
<p>二日劇戰</p>
<p>目下羅源全由陸戰隊與敵激戰中、閩軍卽邱兆琛所率之三團、本月二日、邱部向陸戰隊進迫、當起劇戰、結果卒退被擊、互有死亡、敵軍經此戰事、當然有小部補充、所以至今日仍在白鶴嶺相持中、全閩戰事、自去年十一月十八·十九·已開始、而海軍直接衝突之戰事、以二日迄三日爲最烈、綠敵主攻、故傷亡較我爲重、其時、記者以我方經此奮戰不免亦有受傷士兵、是否將運滬療治相詢、陳答、此乃不必、因閩省我海軍尙有醫院、况海軍在海上原有救護艦與醫艦、泊於附近也、</p>
<p>將來趨勢</p>
<p>記者以閩受中央軍嚴重逼迫、將來如何退避、陳氏謂、閩軍内部已起問題、如吾人所知、戴戟已避香港、昨日消息、則謂蔣光鼐亦已潛離閩省、將來趨勢、蓋閩軍早與共匪聯絡、不得已時、除直接向中央軍輸誠外、一部唯有退往贛省、與共合作、但其中多數兵士、籍隸粤省、故投粤收容、此乃事實使然、</p>
<p>陳不親往</p>
<p>海軍在軍事期間、支出當然比平時爲繁、但經費仍與以前無異、所詢溫州有陸軍調往囗囗、此係軍事、未便明言、李次（世甲）昨晚已返京、現在福州將下、余是否有親往調度、目下未定、總之、馬江已有李司令負責、三都由陳司令調度、毋須余之再往、况中央需人接洽布置、設余再往、則首都比較無人可主持、馬尾海軍學校校長、自杜錫珪作古出缺、現尙未决定繼人、外傳余徴楊部長（樹莊）意見、此消息不知自何而來、殊屬非確、意國首相墨索里尼、爲敦睦中意邦交、允中國海軍生員前往實習、現中央已在着手選派、其名額内定學員六名、人選在考慮中、大槪一二月間、卽可辦畢、再定首途放洋之期、</p>
<p>船所營業</p>
<p>旋詢以去年江南造船所狀况、陳答、江南造船所營業素佳、惟前年馬所長（德驥）任内虧耗一百八十餘萬元、雖其間有海軍所修各艦之費用、包括在内、但虧數過鉅、元氣未免大傷、前年綠一二八戰事、本談不到盈餘、去年雖盈餘少些、約十萬左右、祇能付還舊欠而已、海軍在江南所修小艦、平均每年約六十萬左右、在今日國家經濟狀况下、卽欲振興、亦屬無能、其不虧耗、已屬萬幸、現二十二年度報告已着手編製、約一個月後方克完成、此係歷年之例行公事也、</p>
<p>新塢工程</p>
<p>最後、陳謂、新築船塢工程、於本年五月底可竣工、全塢造價需一百萬元、平海艦工程及下水期難預算、其緣由不外經費問題、以後造艦、海部固有繼續計劃、無奈經費枯竭、空談仍然無益、祇可一部俟諸完成再做一部、余此來因陳副所長（藻藩）赴漢、接洽船所事務、故來代其料理例行公務、陳副所長大槪二三日内卽可返滬、海軍飛機處、最近無擴充之望、前有增撥經費提議、卒因無費可撥而停止、余俟事務告畢、明日（卽今日）卽遄返南京、談畢、記者乃與辭而别、</p>
<p>輪船現狀</p>
<p>毓濟輪被觸處、係在船首、損失最巨、大艙及二艙底層、曾被毁數間、滲入之水極多、目下積水早已抽出、地板上满塗水門汀及楦寨碎木板之類、惟於隙空處仍有細流涓涓絶滲入、底層積水頗多、</p>
<p>船員談話</p>
<p>該輪帳房樊君云、毓濟輪駛行以來、已逾二十年、駛行之路綫、由營口裝貨至烟臺、添貨後、開往興化·琯頭·福州·三港·等地、再由福州裝橘子·靑菓·等菓品至上海卸貨、統常行駛、極爲平安、今次肇禍、實屬不幸、</p>
<p>失事眞相</p>
<p>至此次失事眞相、外間頗多誤傳、緣上月十七日深夜十二時三十分、船正駛至溫州洋面東瓜燈山、全船搭客及船員、均已熟睡、余（樊君自稱）亦在睡夢中、忽聞同事等大聲呼囂、始悉船主因深夜光綫黑暗、稍一疏忽、誤觸於礁石上、船首被損極巨、全船人士、皆手忙脚亂、幸船在東瓜燈山附近、當卽停靠山邊、一方面救護搭客及船員上山避禍、一方面發救急電求援、不久卽得法輪佛里克魯斯號聞警、駛來營救、</p>
<p>損失確數</p>
<p>該輪出事後、拖駁及入塢修理費用、連同公司方面營業上損失、約計三萬元之譜、客貨中以水菓爲最多、共逹一萬餘件、究竟損失若干、須待起卸後、方可知曉、惟水菓約十分之七、均置放於前艙上、失事後、完全沉入海中、其放於後艙者、大半均已霉爛、故爲數亦鉅、全部損失確數、至少須十二萬元、惟公司曾向聯保水火保險公司、保有平安險十二萬元、（前傳十二萬兩不確）尙足相抵、</p>
<p>今日入塢</p>
<p>樊君又向大通社記者云、該輪决於今日午後二時、入董家渡老船塢修理、約三星期始可完竣、</p>

<h3>華東救國軍張志超電告戰况</h3>
<p>冰天雪地苦戰挫敵</p>
<p>期望國人速予聲援</p>
<p>華東民衆救國軍總指揮張志超、於去歲十二月十八日、特派參議王孟餘、　奉其致朱子橋·褚慧僧·杜月笙·等氏白綾絹書代電、轉道大連來滬、晋謁駐滬代表張振東、報告該部孤軍苦戰、及先後克復東興·西集·對靑山車站·等地情形、遠東社記者、昨訪張代表於其寓次、蒙將張總指揮之絹書代電出示、茲將原文誌後、上海朱將軍子橋、後援會朱慧老·吳山老·杜月笙先生、各法團·各報館·鈞鑒志超等原爲有將軍之後盾、與領導而誓死抗日、今將軍忽因他人之破壤而卸責、遽棄超等</p>
<p>孤軍苦戰</p>
<p>於不顧、超等復何爲、但將軍爲全國民衆所最信仰之一人、負救國之重任、豈能因小故而廢棄救國之工作、東北民衆、俱處水深火熱中、無不殷殷望將軍之拯救、蓋捨將軍外、無信仰人也、謹代表東北三千萬民衆、及數十萬苦戰義軍、謹敬致意、務懇卽日</p>
<p>繼續後援</p>
<p>工作、俾超等得以繼續與倭寇死拼、否則、孤軍無援、終歸失敗、特代電申請並通電全國民衆、一致聲援、庶東北有收復之一日、三千萬民衆有出苦之希望、謹將數月來戰况、略陳於左、敬請鑒核、竊超於九月一日離吉邊而至江界、與本部王振琪軍</p>
<p>聯絡進攻</p>
<p>緣吉邊各縣、早被志超所部克復、忽爲某部所嫉妒、致有宣傳志超陣亡、藉以收編我部、適因超特派張總參議振東南下報告、伊等恐洩其私、乃使人竊取張振東之照片、特向哈特務機關告密、懸賞緝拿、誠爲恨事也、志超至江邊後、軍容頗稱狼狽、經數日整理、不兩月而腹地、鏖戰通河、</p>
<p>克復木蘭</p>
<p>殺日人參事官久隆泉、嗣後聯絡民變義軍、奪獲殷翔·大黑河·兩砲艦於三岔河、當在該艦電台、發出極長之通電、不知能否逹到、最近、復先後克復東興縣·西集廠·以及對靑山車站·等地、均以不堪飛機爆炸、相繼退出、不過軍實稍補充耳、所有詳情、已先後函令駐滬代表轉呈、茲不贅、所至堪慮者、卽服裝與醫藥耳、若不亟予購備、</p>
<p>時至大寒</p>
<p>屋門難出、將何作戰、又兩月來戰事、無日不有、以致傷兵逹二千餘、藥料毫無、呻吟呼號、慘不忍聞、我將軍素辦慈善、務懇呼籲各方、亟施救濟、緩恐欲救而無由矣、蓋日僞計劃、陰歷年前肅淸義軍、但我已有相當應付、取游擊方策、化整爲零、散擾中東呼海兩路綫、以及松花江嫩江上下游、所在各縣、一日數驚、至日僞</p>
<p>疲於奔命</p>
<p>月之一日、日僞圖攻我大靑山及鷄關山欄子之根據地、先以飛機偵察、繼以大兵圍攻、我軍沈着應戰、不頃刻間、斃日僞百餘人、而彼尙不知彈之自何發、蓋我山防嚴密、每二里置防卡一、每卡置士兵三十人、敵來則任其前進、待其進至十數卡、然後開始攻擊、取包圍勢、槍聲四起、致敵陷迷途</p>
<p>進退維谷、是役日僞軍共七百餘人、無一生還、而其援軍則不敢深入矣、惟日軍亦機警、每遇山林密處、輙以砲探前進、但亦毫不傷我、僅傷少許樹木耳、設我不據此險、早被日僞消滅、故希望國人早日聲援、俾東北可早日收復、否則國亡無日矣、特此籲請、不勝迫切待命之至、谨呈、華東民衆救國軍總指揮張志超、副指揮王振琪、王振芳、率全體官兵仝叩、十二月十七日</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論「自學」</h3>
<p>昨日周秉南君提出「一個毫無根底的人果能從自學中成就他的所學嗎」？一問題，我們非常高興，認爲這是很有價値的，尤其是在本部開始與許多業餘朋友作學問上探討的時候，實在這是具有非常的意義的一個先决問題。</p>
<p>自然，我們應將這疑團首先粉碎，我們應有自信，不僅讀書如此，卽從事其他一切事業都不能例外。失了自信，只有頽喪，不能生出向前邁進的勇氣。這是千眞萬確。</p>
<p>關於「自學」是否可以獲得成功，這要從幾方面來說。從學問的性質說，自然科學，毫無根底的人是不便自學的，因爲這門學問最主要的在實騐，離開實騐，没有相當的環境（實騐室科學館），專從書本上去追求，是無用的。所以，其成功是困難。以外如「語文學」也是一樣學習外國語非練習「說」不可，自修可以得到「看」「寫」的成功，但無「說」的環境，「說」的成功之困難的。至於文學與社會科學則不然，它的取材是整個社會生活，任你如何去吸取是取之不盡的，只要你忠於實踐，不歪曲眞實，你從實際日常生活中就不知不覺受到訓練了。你再加以理論的探討，或技術的修養，說不定你就可以成爲一個文學者或社會科學家。再從「成功」二字說，也有幾種不同的看法。許多人以「成名」爲成功，但眞的成功者不見得眼前卽成了「名」；尤其是在藝術方法是是如此。有些人以能博得物質的報酬多少爲成功，也有人視爲取得「博士」「碩士」頭銜爲成功，世間也還有看不起這些，却專爲自已的勝業努力，預備「藏之名山，傳之其人」不管世俗的一切酬報的。不過，就我們這些窮小子說，以上這些的「成功」的解說，都不是我們希望的。我們讀書的態度不是爲顯逹，不是想做學者，更不是爲的「名山之業」，我們爲的是實用，是認識實際生活，和如何去奮鬭，以開展自已或大衆的生活。如果抱了這種態度，我們再選一種或數種與自已個性相近而又便於自學的科學。在一面爲生活掙扎，一面去自學，得到一點是一點，多知道一點，就是「成功」，並且這才是實踐的知識，對你才有實用。</p>
<p>許多人認爲讀書必入學校，這是一種錯誤觀念。固然學校是求知較好的塲所，但學校只能給你一個環境，一部指南，學問的成功與否完全在你自已。你有了一册旅行指南，如果不去旅行，實地遊歷，你只是在做夢，並不能說你眞的了解某地的眞實狀况。凡是在學問上稍有成就的人，都是自已自學成功的，多是在出校後，在圖書中，自已書室中，一切實際生活的領域各，磨練，刻苦，一點點的而逹到的。你試看近二十年來在新文學上成功的人，他們多半不是學文科的，魯迅，郭沫若是醫生出身，周作人學海軍，張資平學開礦，丁玲女士連大學都未進過，郁逹夫是學政治經濟的人，沈從文據說還當過兵，他們現在都獲得相當成功了。這成功都是由於自已的努力。</p>
<p>說到根基，自然是很重要的。但根基不穏也不要緊，因爲只要你努力，也可由自已漸漸培植。成功是不可一日而得，它是一點點的從艱苦中得來，绝没有取巧的方法。</p>
<p>馬可尼說得好，「人們認爲某事不可爲者，未必靠得住。吾人知所謂不可爲者常係因其人對於有關之各面未得充分認識。卽使他人以爲未可而前途初看似覺無望者，亦必主張另闢研究之新途徑」。我們應有他這種精神。我們生活太忙碌了，太不安定了，今日不知道明天的生活會起什麽變化，我們那有閑情來讀書呢？你的朋友，大槪都是這樣的心情，這是一種最無長進的思想。生在今日要生活如何平平安安是不可能的，生活太好了，也許你一切均满足，也就無心思去讀書，我們要等待生活安定再去求知，這是一種幻想。只有不計失敗，卽令知其不可爲也要去「爲」，繼可獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<p>總之：你提出的問題，以上大槪簡單的答覆了。不知是否可以粉碎你的疑念？本館讀書指導是建立在以上的信念上的，現在正預備我們自已自學的經騐，與業餘諸君探討，共同來作各自的努力，成功依然要靠諸君自已，並且一定是從「自學」中獲得。丨敬</p>

<h3>招待全國醫師大會代表茶會演說詞</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>中國殺人的工具進步而生人工具糢糊例如全國軍隊廢舊式弓箭而採用新槍砲醫無中西新舊之分只有科學非科學之别國產藥材應用科學方法繼續研究及整理醫師們應努力使中國人類享受新醫之賜　　全國醫師公會聯合會第三次代表大會諸君¨</p>
<p>這一次代表大會開在南京，行政院同人對之實深馨祝，聞說第一次開在上海，第二次開在杭州，對於醫界前途都有很大的貢獻，這一次開在南京，定然一樣，而且更表示很多的進步的，醫界的進步和發逹，對於社會安寗，人類幸福，是有極密切的關係，所以行政院同人對於諸君的企望，也十分深厚，聞得大會會期只得三日，諸君畫夜工作，極爲忙碌，所以僅能略備一些茶點，聊表敬意，承諸君不棄，在百忙中分出寳貴的光陰，來此一堂相聚，兄弟謹代表行政院同人深致謝意。</p>
<p>近百年來，因爲科學進步的結果，一切事物，都更新了，自殺人的工具如軍事武器等，以至生人的工具如醫學藥劑等，都有很大的變化，但是我們覺得中國人，對於殺人工具的比較進步，判斷得極爲淸楚，而對於生人工具的比較進步，却極其模糊，有舉棋不定的趨向，何以見得呢，從前淸咸豐末同治初，曾國藩李鴻章一般人，同太平天國打仗的時候，便知道洋槍的利害，從此之後，故兵工廠練新軍，不多幾時全國軍隊都抛棄了舊式的弓箭刀槍，而採用新式槍砲，再沒有一枝軍隊以爲弓箭刀槍可以抵禦槍砲的，雖然近來還有所謂大刀救國論，但這只是玩意兒，便是提倡的人，也自知玩意兒，他的根本主張，還是以添置槍砲爲重的，可見得我們中國人對於殺人工具的比較進步判斷得極爲淸楚，他們絕不守舊，極其維新，他們絕不留戀舊式的弓箭刀槍，而積極的採用新式槍砲。</p>
<p>至於人生工具又如何呢，不用舉别的例，只看有的謂中醫西醫的對立存在，便可以知道我們中國人，對於人生工具的比較進步，全沒有澈底明瞭的判斷，如果拿三個指頭去摸脈的稱作中醫，那麽，拿弓箭刀槍的自然也可稱做中軍了，如果應用科學知識科學器具來治病的稱做西醫，那末，採用新式槍砲的自然不能不稱做西軍了，但是現在社會中軍西軍的名詞，並不存在，而中醫西醫的名詞，居然存在，卽此一例，中國人對於生人工具的比較進步沒有對有殺人工具那麽明瞭，是無可辯護的。</p>
<p>本來不但醫學爲然，一切學問，都無中西之分，只有新舊之分，其實新舊二字，還太籠統，只能說是科學與非科學之分，百年以前，西方醫學模糊曖昧，並不見得比中國醫學怎樣高明，百年以來，因爲科學發逹，將科學的知識，應用在醫學上去，方纔成爲現代的醫學，現代的醫學是現代的一切人類所共同努力共同享受的，只要是現代的人類，就要將現代的醫學，來增進社會安寗，人類幸福於此並無國别可以存在，不但西方爲然，東方如日本維新以前，醫學全是模倣中國，及至维新以後，努力於現代醫學之進步，同時以現代科學之知識整理日本固有的方法劑和藥材，對於現代的醫學有了不少的貢獻，所謂國醫，西醫，的名詞，在日本是不會對立存在的，因爲只有科學的現代的醫學，無所謂國醫，亦無所謂西醫。</p>
<p>兄弟說這話的時候，並不是抹殺了我們中國從前的一切醫學，兄弟知道中國人積神農以來之經騐，對於疾病有了不少的方劑，而地大物博尤其有不少的藥材，這些方劑和藥材都是極應繼續研究，加以適當之整理的，但是研究與整理是要應用科學的知識，科學的方法，使其成爲現代醫學之一部份，决不是脫離了現代的醫學而對立存在，如果有對立存在的觀念，那末，便陷入了非科學的歧途，所以兄弟主張中國只應有現代的醫學，無所謂中醫，無所謂西醫。　　舉個例來說，如今居然有人以爲中醫能治傳染病，且能消毒，這眞可謂奇怪之至，須知道傳染病是從微生物來的，微生物是從顯微鏡下看出來的，絕不是三個指頭可以摸得着，一雙肉眼可以看得見，然則所謂中醫從何知道那些是傅染病呢，連知道還不可能，又如何能治傅染病能消毒呢，以此事權会之所謂中醫，其結果必至硬指非傅染病者爲傅染病，硬指傅染病者爲非傅染病，硬指非傅染病者爲傅染病，其結果不過病人倒霉，或病人一家倒霉，硬指傅染病爲非傅染病，其危險可就大了，其結果可以使整個社會蒙其災害，我們知道傅染病之預防及其撲滅，爲現代醫學一大發明，亦卽現代人類一大福祉，如果使所謂中醫脫離了現代醫學而獨立存在，那末不能不認爲現代的中國人類擔憂不少　　以上的話，都是極其膚淺的，似乎在小學裹讀過幾頁衛生敎科書的人都可以明白，然而到現在，中國以内，中醫西醫對立存在仍然是現實，所以兄弟不能不搖頭嘆氣，說中國人對於人工具極其認眞，而對於生人工具太過馬了　　諸君都是負着生人的責任的，以生人爲職業的，對此現實，搖頭歎氣，度必不讓於兄弟，然則在這回大會裹，相與討論，如何改良這些現實呢，卽是如何而使中國人類都能享受現代醫學的所賜呢，如何而使以生人爲職業的人，能努力於現代醫學之進步，而沒有歧念呢，似乎是這一回大會裹所應該注意的。　　兄弟對於醫學是門外漢，今日只能站在政府同人的立塲，向諸君說話，上頭說過，醫學是保障社會安寗，人類幸福的，政府對之自然應該盡力，積極的方面加以保護發逹，消極的方面，予以破除障碍，這是政府應盡的責任，縱使一時不能全然做到，也必要努力的使其逐漸做到，今日奉邀諸君一堂，茶話除了表示敬意之外，就只能貢獻這一點點意見與希望。</p>
<h3>招待全國醫師大會代表演詞</h3>
<p>— 劉瑞恒</p>
<p>「諸位先生遠道來京與會，連日會議甚忙，本日薄具餐飲，藉表歡迎，承荷惠臨，至爲感謝。惟時間怱促，未能將敝署工作詳細報告，祇得擇要略談。</p>
<p>兄弟自到南京，業已五年。對於衛生建設，深愧無甚進步，實由於近年來整個政治及軍事財政，未能十分安定，故關於各項衛生設施之經濟人才，亦均受影響，常覺困難。以致未能如預定之進展。關於此點，平時多承各位先生督責指敎，極爲感佩，惟此項困難情形，不可不略說一說，希望諸位先生賜以洞察。</p>
<p>在此締創艱難之際，衛生部又縮併爲衛生署，三十以來機關雖小，而各項工作奮鬥求進，未敢稍懈。現中央醫院與全國經濟委員會衛生實騐處兩建築，均新落成。關於人才之培植，及臨時與基本各學科方面之研究，有此基礎，規模粗具，可以致力。深盼諸位先生餐後惠臨參觀，指導一切。惟此兩建築，所有用欵，除華僑胡文虎先生捐助建築中央醫院一部分外，其餘悉由政府設法籌給，至爲不易，外間有以爲外國予以補助，全非事實。至其他工作，如縣立醫院之恊助推進及學校衛生，衛生工程，以及各項細菌學，寄生講學等，實地設施工作，均散佈於各地方，時間怱促，未能一一前往參觀說明，甚爲抱歉。</p>
<p>現在醫事衛生方面，待舉辦之事甚多，對於推進科學醫學，吾人均負責任。昨日汪院長對於此點，有極詳盡之演說，希望各位先生回到各地方，對於發展科學醫科，多多盡力。並希望以後隨時指敎，聯絡。</p>
<h3>中國醫事前途急待解次之幾個根本問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 胡安安</p>
<p>其二所謂打破醫界派别問題也　中國最不得力於東西留學生之爲國貢獻，即在派别上爲之作梗，最爲主因，無論何界因派别觀念而引起成見者比比皆是，而在吾醫界於今爲烈，原夫科學大同，向國外求醫藥新智識後，其唯一之要職，厥爲介紹新醫藥學識而增進己國醫學藥學，乃不圖所學外國語文之不同，在同一科學的醫學原則下，遽爾割分畛域，徒誇所學於某國之優長，因態度與觀感，引起同道之不平不服，此新醫界不良之現象，最感不幸者，不僅已種因於醫界之中，且社會智識階級客觀上視吾醫界亦於無形中感有劃分派别之印象，自身團結也之不努力，環境影響之加以培成，宜乎醫界成見愈結愈深，糾紛亦遂愈起愈複，事定昭然，不必諱言，吾人厠身社會，敢信爲打破派别問題奮鬭有年唱此口號亦勝屢矣，而卒未得若何效果，可槪也夫。</p>
<p>派别之生，非生於生之日，蓋必有所由起，隠憂之作不作於作之日，亦必有所由兆，故今日醫界派别之開端也，吾不曰在社會服務之醫師，而曰在政之</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>醫事當局，及其顯著也，吾不曰爲醫事主持公道公理之犠牲者而曰在一般野心家，故吾人苟一致有誠意爲醫事糾紛連謀圓满解决之途徑，當以科學大同，國家爲重，消除派别，捐棄成見爲主要條件，使全國醫界只知以促進中國醫藥學術爲唯一職責，庶幾醫事前途得留一線之光，不致如政治潮流彼此傾軋無已時也，旣能免除向來醫界同行嫉妬最不體面之卑劣觀念，即可養成提倡醫德同道研求切磋崇尙學術之良好風氣，治本必淸其源，對症可以下藥，吾人爲挽救中國醫事之混亂糾紛，不得不先從打破派别着手，然後以精誠謀團結，以信羲謀合作，使目前新醫界頓換一新局面，即對醫事前途亦可逆料闢一未來之光明世界，吾醫界同人各本天良，以努国從事貫澈此種善意主張，未始非中國醫界之幸，亦國家人民之福也，故打破派别問題，亦可爲解决中國醫事之中心問題，不可不重注意焉。</p>
<p>其三所謂醫藥科學化問題也，吾人欲使中國醫藥學術突飛猛晋而樹千萬年獨立之鞏固基礎，此處最成問題者，必使非科學之醫藥學說，隨科學潮流之進步而盡歸於科學化，因在中國學術尙少根基，民智信仰，或有與科學相背之理論反爲接近，故吾人在科學信條下，中國整個醫藥學術問題，以自然科學法則爲基礎，當趨於一致謀科學化，此不僅可免一切國内學術上之爭論，且能與國際間共守科學大同之規範此科學化運動，當由有科學化訓練之醫者起而謀合理之取捨，以應中國醫學上急切之需要，然後關於適合科學之醫藥學術得以發揚光大，一切非科學醫藥自歸淘汰，而不復有存在之地位，亦爲自然趨勢所不可免之事實矣，至於科學醫藥之本事，原不必求科學化，但須負有使非科學醫藥急趨於科學化之責任，且亦先須求上項二個問題之解决，對此問題，乃爲醫界當然之共同目標也明矣。</p>
<p>其四所謂醫藥人才之分配與出路問題也　醫事中心固負有分配醫藥人才之職務，第支配不得其當，與一二兩項之根本問題，即生重大之衝突，吾人急須使人盡其才，且人盡其能，而後可以人盡其職，必也無徧重與畸形之弊，全國醫藥人才各按其志趣所向以使各得其所，則一切醫事之興舉，得藉醫界之總力量能迅速成功，反之，使一部分醫藥界向隅，致學非所用，於國家亦屬有損，况其本人乎，年來服務社會之醫界，擠於大都市，表面上似現人才過剩之象，實際上按諸全國面積，與人口分配，猶感不敷，在中央旣有登記之總調查，似應有通盤籌劃而使各安其業之方針，以共同策進中國醫事建設，爲醫政之至要設施，即各醫藥學校新畢業之醫藥人才，均預爲其打算出路，此爲國家技術人才計所當如是，而爲中國醫事前途計，更當注意其出路爲尤切要也，人才不致浪用，如可負醫事上較大責任者不使之幹不適當職務，人才不致濫用，如醫學醫學有根底者能得適當位置，人才不致虚棄，如在醫藥界能貢獻者不使幹非關藥事之業務，此數項均指醫事上軌道之國家而言，而亦可視爲爲醫藥人才求正當出路之大計也，且也必須顧及醫事上之各方面需要而使醫藥人才之深造，亦有正确之標凖與稳定之保障，幷能徇其天能致力於醫藥學術爲國家效用，此對於醫育方面，亦有密切之關係也，本問題亦未始非社會問題一部分，在吾醫界尤應從長計議及之。</p>
<p>其五所謂醫育當注重實際應用問題也　觀乎中國大都市，醫學人才成有過剩之慮，實際上當猶不能以爲足用，可見醫育方面之應側重社會上需要，培植實用人才，爲民療病，甚屬目前刻不容緩之當懸爲正鵠，高深之醫學研究機關，當然爲培植醫學基礎人才與學者產生之所，而與農工幷重之實際醫學專校，已爲中央决定之敎育設施方針，在目下中國情勢，各省之醫育，全在此關鍵，吾人完全就事論事，作公道之主張，此問題亦豈宜忽諸乎。</p>
<p>以上　　諸大端，吾認爲醫界當前應速解决之重大根本問題，餘項問題，尙不止此，因限於篇幅，不及備述，容當另爲文論之，今欣値全國醫師聯合會第三次代表大會在首都開幕之盛，同道濟濟一堂，討論重大醫事，即不啻間接討論一部分重大國事，何則，盡本職也，此篇之作，應本刋之徴而草成，明知吾言之或有未當，唯耿耿此心，苟有利於國家，有利於醫事前途，無不極願隨諸同仁之後，以精誠團結之精神，發揮吾道之本能，使中國黯淡之醫事前途從此光明，是則區區恐忱，或亦能博諸同道之同情歟，吾不僅爲醫界馨香禱祝已也。</p>

<p>答　如果是表在性的，可以施行外科手術。</p>
<h3>診餘閒談（續）</h3>
<p>— 張森玉</p>
<p>（丑）膵腸液　這液是由膵腸裹分泌而排泄到十二指腸裹面的，而是水淸粘性的液汁，又呈鹼性，液内含有三種酶素，如澱粉酶，鹼腈酶（譯音替利潑新），脂肪酶（譯音斯特亞潑新）或呌利柏舍）等。</p>
<p>（一）澱粉酶　將食物裹的腈粉元素化成糖，但是在鹼性液内。</p>
<p>（二）鹼腈酶　上面講過的酸腈酶要在酸性液才起消化的作用，這酶同酸腈酶一樣，將蛋白質析成易吸收的亞米羅酸，但是在鹼性液内，故有這名稱。</p>
<p>（三）三脂肪酶　將尙未消化的脂肪分解爲脂酸和甘油，末後兩種都能在水内溶解和混和，甘油則爲水溶性，脂酸當和膽汁内所含的鹼如鉀或鈉化成脂酸鉀或钠，這就呌鹼化，這時才能吸收。</p>
<p>（寅）腸液　由腸管壁上佈着的小腺分泌而排出的，所曉得的作用就是使腸管的液汁變成鹼性，因爲上面的酶素都要在鹼性液汁裹才起作用，而且由胃臟裹輸到十二指腸裹的食物糜糊帶了些酸素在裹面，可使化成鹼性，則不致傷害腸内的酶素。　　（三）全部消化器的工作由食物造成粪渣爲止備略的叙在後面。</p>
<p>液性的食物如乳汁，湯水等則由口腔的動作吸進去，再嚥下而逹食管，乾燥和固體的食物則由唇和齒捉住用齒咀嚼的時候持着在舌和硬上顎蓋的中間，一部分嚼細後再由舌推未嚼的至兩排牙齒的中間，如此細微的動作着，待全部嚼細後方送到舌根上面，這咀過的食物碎屑被口涎濕潤成爲糜糊，爲口涎内含的一種澱粉酶「潑替亞林」將一部份澱粉化成糖，由腔内粘膜吸收而逹血管的血液裹面，一種粘液「姆淸」使糜糊滑潤，又有水濕潤，容易滑嚥，再由舌，上顎的肌肉，咽腔的肌肉的推移向下的動作，即使各種食物的糜糊吞嚥到食管裹面，由食管的肌肉節節順推而下，胃的岔門關啓，灌輸到胃裹面，陸續吃進去的亦不絕的送進去，由胃儲藏着，再由胃的兩層肌肉交錯推動着，使糜糊攪動，更爲稀薄而碎爛，被胃液的稀鹽酸凝涷蛋白質，再由酸腈酶「倍布辛」侵進去，化成溶性「倍布頓」，被腸粘膜吸收到血管的血液裹面，其他的食物碎屑如筋，軟骨，硬骨（誤嚥的），各種動物的細包組織如皮，　膜肌肉纎維絲等，植物的細胞纎維質組織如葉，木質，莖皮，根等，則軟化，裹面的液質則提出，澱粉如米，麥，馬鈴蘑，豆類等所含的亦軟化，而成溶性的，所未化的質地和渣滓仍混和在糜湖裹面，逐漸往下推，由胃的肌肉節節推動使幽門開啓，灌注到十二指腸裹面，但是糊裹面還帶了胃液往下，故由腸腺分泌的腸液將酸性化去</p>
<p>消息一束</p>
<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰出版</h3>
<p>此書爲龐京周醫師出版所著，描寫上海市醫藥與社會間之實况，旁及種種非正式之治療與刋物敎育醫政等問題，意在使醫界本身，社會人士，對於國内醫藥以上海爲標準，得槪括的認識，庶幾共謀改進，而市内病家求醫，尤可格爲南針也。定價每册大洋四角，外埠酌加郵費，寄售處望平街申報館，愛文義路池浜路四一號上海南醫師公會，馬浪路新民村四號醫藥評論社，北京路二六六號五定公司，老大沽路新馬安里三四號社會醫報館，愛文義路道逹里三號龐醫師診所。</p>
<p>止痛良藥　凡曾患痛風症者，十九不免痛定思痛之感，蓋在就診於病院期間，當醫者進行治療之時，其所受痛苦，或亘數日之久，或竟經旬靡已痛澈心肺，苦不堪言，嗣雖幸而告愈，然而痛苦印象，已深留於腦海，是以過後思量，輒爲心悸，每一憶及，若有餘痛存焉，按此種種痛楚，蓋皆以電氣浴諺治冶風濕部份，如筋肉骨節等，引起激烈反應之結果，但經度治療，痛卽漸次减少，而患者亦於是乎確認電氣浴乃眞有益之治方，惟是美中不足者，凡因施術而起反應以致發生之一切不良現象，迄今猶無防止之可能，故欲求此種痛苦之减少，祇得乞靈於藥餅耳，厥後維也納左近之著名拜登醫院中諸大醫師，憚思竭慮，多方研究，並弳迭次嚴格測騐，終乃證明止痛藥中之確實最具神效者，端惟譽满宇内之加當（Ｇａｒｄａｎ）尤足稱者，其餘諸般痛苦，如按摩及淸腸通便等，確皆疼痛難忍也，惟有加當治之，卽亦無不立愈，據此可知加當蓋確能减少疾病治療之痛苦，並確予病者以無上安慰之靈效聖藥也。　　（本原）本品爲吾國北方所產廠黄科（Gnetaｃｅａｏ）植物Ｅｐｈｅｄｒａ　Ｓｉｎｉｃａ　Ｓａｐｆ　Ｅｐｈｅｄｒａ　ｅｑｕｉｓｅｔｉｎａ　Ｂｕｎｇｏ及Ｅｐｈｅｄｒａ　ｄｉｓｔａｃｈｙｅ　Ｌｉｎｎ＇ｓ之莖，於秋季未經霜之前，採集乾燥所得者。</p>
<p>（性狀）本品有微臭，味收歛而微帶麻痺性，形狀因植物之不同而異，茲分别述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）Ｅｐｈｅｄｒａ　ｓｉｎｉｃａ　Ｓｔａｐｆ　本植物爲市塲上最多見之品，係草本，全長約三分之一米逹，綠莖自根發生，厚在１ｍｍ以上，微扁，表面粗糙，分叉頗稀，節間之長約爲３－５Ｃｍ節上有鳞片狀之葉長約３ｍｍ</p>
<p>（二）Ｅｐｈｅｄｒａ　ｅｑｕｉｓｅｔｉｎａ　Ｂｕｎｇｅ本植物全長爲１－２ｍ，係大木，綠莖自木化莖上發生，圓而平滑，公叉甚多，直徑較前者略小，各節間之長爲１－３Ｃｍ，鳞片葉亦較前者爲小，尖端現白色。</p>
<p>（三）Ｅｐｈｅｄｉａ　ｄｉｓｔａｒｈｙａ　Ｌｉｎｕ＇ｅ本植物全長１ｍ．係一種微近木本之植物，綠莖自木質之莖上發生，圓而粗糙，有分叉，直徑較第１一種者大，節間之長爲２－５Ｃｍ，鳞葉較第一種者小，現淡綠色。</p>
<p>（成分）本品中之主要成分，爲麻黃葉，（Ｅｐｈｅｄｒｉｎａ）係日本藥學博士長井長義所發見，有Ｃ６Ｈ５ＣＨ．ＯＨ．ＣＨ３．ＮＨ．ＣＨ３之構造式，爲無色之結晶，無臭，味微極苦，有與氯化合而成鹽酸麻黃素者。</p>
<p>（效用）本品爲發汗藥，其麻黃素之主要作用爲增高血壓，增進心力，收縮液膜之血管，擴張枝氣管，痙攣，此等作用，皆由其能刺激交感神經系與肌肉之聯絡　而來，其作用與腎上腺素甚爲相似，但亦有不同之處，例如麻黃素能刺激腸肌及中樞神經系統，與抑制分泌機能之效力，且其於新陳代謝之作用，亦少變化，麻黃素之優於腎上線素者有二，一爲可以口服，二爲效力較久。</p>
<p>麻黃素之主要應用，爲治氣喘，每日服二三次，亦可收預防之效，敷於鼻腔，可使膨脹之粘液膜立時收縮，故傷風時用之，可免病者鼻塞之苦，鼻部行外科手術時，亦可用之，因其有增高血壓之效力，故於行脊髓麻醉術時，可用以預防血壓卒然低降，此外應用之處尙多，由病膚病亞月經痛，皆有其相當之地位。</p>
<p>（附錄舊說）神農本經曰，麻黃味苦溫，主中風，傷寒，頭痛，溫　發表现汗，去邪熱氣，止欬逆上氣，除寒熱，此藥莖幹叢生直立，氣味收歛，而有逐　之力，故解邪氣壅塞，以通腠理，專透水濕，以除骨節疼痛，與桂枝之發表併用，則能治駿發，麻黃湯大靑龍之類是也，與石膏之淸降併用，則能利水濕，越脾湯麻杏甘之類是也，前人但充發汗之葉，細考之，非有發汗之功，張仲景曰，發汗後不可更行桂枝湯，汗出而喘無大熱者，麻杏甘石湯主之，可以微矣。</p>
<p>（附註）麻黃中之麻黃素，雖係多年以前所發現者，但五年前，未經我國陳克恢及美國Ｓｃｈｍｉｄｔ二氏重行詳細分析研究之，醫學界極少注意，及之近年來，其應用已普遍全世界，歐美醫學書報中，關於此藥之論文甚多，陳克恢與Ｓｃｈｍｉｄｔ　二氏，近復廣集世界學者之研究所得，而總其大成，發表於美國最著名之醫學雜誌中，其所參考之論文，約在四百種以上，且多爲最近之作品，關於麻黃之化學性質，藥理效力，以及臨床上之應用等，皆有極詳細之討論。</p>

<h3>西捕雄風尙在曁南空前慘敗</h3>
<p>陣線散漫表演减色</p>
<p>西捕高大無力抗拒</p>
<p>▲五比零▲甲組賽</p>
<p>愁雲籠罩、微有雪意、申園中昨日三千球迷、在冷氣中危坐以觀曁南西捕之戰、結果大失所望、曁南竟一蹶不振、五比零空前慘敗、表演减色、全軍如一盤沙、令人不信其曾以二比零克服東華也、茲將其失敗原因及戰鬥情形、略述如次、　　失敗原因　昨日之曁南健兒、似凍僵於冷氣之中、舉止不靈、動作又慢、異乎尋常、救出險球不少外、顧尙勷實爲一支大柱、獨守後方、吃力非常、前鋒梅洪寳外、卽徐亞輝亦一籌莫展、王蔡更莫談矣、陳鎭祥偶送數球、周紹文如一不能玩球之孩子、中衛線如此、安得不敗、加以身材大小、亦爲昨日得失之一大原因、西捕個個身高力大、曁南相形之下、不可比儗、動作旣不敏速、於是欲得球難矣、</p>
<p>長期被迫　九十分鐘中、曁南皆處於重重厭迫之下、雖偶有數次突破重圍、轉瞬敵騎又至、上半時西捕圍攻逹四十分鐘後、西捕才由活根生先開紀錄、此四十分鐘中、曁南能保持不敗、殊屬大幸特幸、守門徐亨救險之功、自然居半、而西捕一舉足可中而失去者無其數、苟西捕脚頭稍凖、上半時中、早當大敗特敗、其紀錄當在五六次以上、上半時旣成一比零、下半時曁南果我不克再守、深爲惋惜、</p>
<p>戰幕初開　曁南順風、因衛根生之越位、五鋒乘勢進迫西捕、初上塲聯絡甚佳、西捕反攻、衛根生與培特、左右開弓、連射二次、皆爲徐亨撲出、全塲呌好、雲逢　出球失的、飛落後方、幸賴作榮之一頂、免於禍、梅洪寳進、吉勃生自後追之、梅送中央、亞輝不能得、王南珍開弓甚凖、又中蒲斯手中、衛根生又來、周紹文手足無措、賴作榮急急趕來、衛傳中央、由逹維爾至德飛、對凖球門、一射卽中、竟一飛冲天、全塲閧然失笑、</p>
<p>西捕破門　西捕五號、攻勢不止、又入曁南腹地、賴作榮慌無所措、顧尙勷顧此失彼、幸徐亨見勢不佳、棄門奔出、搶球出險、羅海光得後方來球、孤軍深入、許德失足、正可打門、以舉足過遲、維持至四十分鐘時、開始失守、培特得惠士和球、送入中央、飛過顧尙勷、徐亨一回首、衛根生已自後跳起一頂而進、上半時一比零、</p>
<p>一蹶不振　下半時西捕順風、形勢更大變特變、十分鐘後、衛根生得角球、徐亨跳起未得、培特左右、乘勢頂中、二比零、再在分鐘、培特又沿邊線直襲、顧尙勷追之、迫不得已、傳至中央、逹維爾在無人寫意意之中攻入、三比零、德飛又中、四比零、</p>
<p>十二碼球　離終局尙有十五分鐘、曁南拚命反攻、以免片甲不歸、王南珍傳徐亞輝、亞輝匹馬冲入、前方無人、直入門前、許德自後急急來、被其一撞、徐倒、判罰十二碼、梅洪寳踢、軟而無力、向右滾去、蒲斯一捧而起、此十二碼球不中、曁南乃吃鴨蛋矣、最後又爲衛根生射中一球、五比零下塲、</p>

<h3>合生</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>宋代的說話，有所謂合生者，孟元老的東京夢華錄，和吳自牧的夢梁錄，都說及的。但是究竟是一種什麽頑意？却沒有說明。夢梁錄只說：「合生與起今隨今相似，各占一事也。」起今隨今何解？也無從查考，不過諸宮調中有合生，可以推想，是一種歌唱的說話。近來孫楷第的中國通俗小說書目的分類說明，以爲「合生，商謎爲對答商略。」大致和現在的雙簧滑稽一類，差不多的。　　但是我看到宋張齊賢洛陽搢紳舊聞記中間，有一段話，說得比較的更詳細些。他說：「有談歌婦人楊苧羅，善合生雜嘲，辨慧有才思，當時罕與比者，少師｜楊凝式以姪女呼之，蓋念其聰俊也。時僧雲辨能俗講，有文章，敏於應對，若祀祝之辭，隨其名位高下對之，立成千字，皆如宿構。少師尤重之。雲辨於長籌寺五月講少師詣講院，與雲辨對坐，歌者在側，忽有大蜘蛛於　前垂絲而下，正對少師於僧前，（此句疑有脫字）雲辨笑謂歌者曰：「試嘲此蜘蛛，嘲和着，奉絹兩匹。」歌者更不待思慮，應聲嘲之，意全不離蜘蛛，而嘲成之辭，正諷雲辨。少師聞之絕倒，久之，大呌曰：「和尙取絹五匹來。」雲辨且笑，遂以絹五匹奉之。歌者嘲蜘蛛云：「喫得肚嬰（音嬰，是方的鐘。形容肚皮的隆大。）撑，尋絲繞寺行，空中設羅網，祇待殺衆生。」（蓋雲辨體肥而肚大故也。）</p>
<p>從這一段話裹，可以知道合生不僅是歌唱，並且要隨機應變，嘲戲博人笑樂。因此連隨今起今兩個名詞，也得了大意，就是把眼前景物，本地風光，來作調侃資料的。鄭振鐸引白樂天「高調管色吹銀字」句，斷定夢梁錄所云小說一名銀字兒，爲說話時伴奏的樂器。爲之一快。今得合生之證，亦是一喜。</p>
<h3>隨便</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>最近接到出國不久的一位同學的來信。他說，在課程方面，中國幾個有名的大學，並不比美國的「推板」。不過美國人對敎育辦得「認眞」，中國的敎育就比較辦得「隨便」；這是一個判别優劣的地方。在美國，因爲辦敎育的，和受敎育的，共同深印着一個「認眞」的觀念，其勢雙方都不能「隨便」，那一方在「隨便」，對方就得命他「請便」。美國敎育能辦到這般成效，是値得贊歎的！</p>
<p>我想，從中國許多留美學生的成績看來，這話多少似乎有些折扣。美國敎育無論辦得怎樣認眞，但要辦到「那一方在隨便，就得命他請便」的地步，我總疑心我那位同學在自誇「認眞」。不過事事喜觀「隨便」的中國人，一旦踏進毫無通融的美國學校，處處很易感到「認眞」的印象，確是當然的事實。</p>
<p>中國人不僅讀書喜歡隨便。小之如吐痰·撒尿；大至造謡，作亂，沒有一件不在「隨便」上用功夫。鄕下人尺寸基地給人家侵佔了去，就是賣掉祖宗的墳地還得告狀。而日本搶奪我們幾千萬方里的土地，他們似乎就很隨便，這種寛大的胸懹，要是給美國人知道了，也是値得贊歎的！</p>
<p>「隨便」這兩個字，細細的研究起來，確也有很多妙用。</p>
<p>譬如吧，新聞記者去訪問要人：「先生來此有何使命」？回答一定是：「我久慕此地風景，這次是來「隨便」玩玩」。假使這位不識相的新聞記者偏不肯隨便，進一步問到「先生和×××會談何事」那末，他所探得的消息，就祇有「隨便」談談」這四個字！這種輕快，寫意，玄妙的談吐，要是給美國人知道了，也是値得贊歎的！</p>
<p>中國人雖說事事喜歡隨便，但也不不肯隨便的地方。</p>
<p>我從前在北平有位身有固定職業同時又到ＸＸ大學去選讀幾門功課的朋友。學期開始那天。註册後他跑去訪問敎務長，可否領了講義在校外研究，不到學校上課？敎務長回答他兩個字｜「隨便」。旣經接洽圓滿，他就拔脚想走。敎務長似乎忽地想起一件事情，「一本正經」的問他：「你…費繳過沒有」？</p>
<p>哦！中國人也有不肯「隨便」的地方！這種「認眞」的觀念，我可不願給美國人知道，還是我們自己留着贊歎吧！</p>
<h3>矛盾</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>雖然「人」與「事」是絕對的不能分開，但是這般說數，是指衆人之事和管事的一部人而言；如果一人一事，有時便有了獨力性，我所以如此解釋：是因爲社會的一切，或爲人的矛盾，或爲事的矛盾；譬如人的言行不符，事的表裹相反，通常一句月旦的用語，都說是矛盾，於是社會種種，便充滿了矛看的現實。</p>
<p>電車上的賣票，一往一來兩輛車子互相疾馳着，見到他們眉目傳情，乘客們便知道似乎是问前面有查票員麽？以定他們揩油的步驟；一會兒查票員登車，賣票的照例迎上一步，恭而敬之請呌聲「先生」；駛過一站，查票員下車了，賣票的面示一陣苦笑，接着又是馬而哈之一句「赤老」；這個矛盾的事實，好像成了他們的定例。</p>
<p>一個裝有熱水汀的公共宴會所在，往往因爲溫度太熱了，身處其間的男女們，轉覺有些難受，於是就有人嚷嚷着；開電風扇；因爲怕冷，要裝熱水汀，因爲怕熱，要裝電風扇：現在又怕冷，又怕熱，眞是難爲了物質的文明！結果只好熱水汀與電風扇齊開；一位妙齡女郎，自頂至踵裝飾的盡是縞素，我們一見便曉得伊，不是遭了父喪，就是遭了喪，遵着古訓，守制三年；但是櫻唇的一點口紅，却殷然在望，做了伊粉頰上異樣的標幟；這類矛盾的事實，大槪是爲了「摩登」逼迫出來的「矛盾」吧。</p>
<h3>二十三年的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>去年是「國貨年」，今年是「婦女國貨年」。國貨年中，一切有關國貨的揭幕禮，都是由女子執行的。一切時裝展覽會，都用女子做衣架。但在「婦女國貨年」中，這些工作，都將由男子承乏。</p>
<p>都市中的不景氣，今年將益發濃厚。農村中的崩潰情形，也將一天劇烈似一天。於是乎農村的人，向都市裹鑽，都市裹的人，向農村裹退。於是十八層大厦中，將擠滿鄕下人，而農村中，滿佈着摩登的男士與女士。這是「溝通文化」，但是依舊不能解决「　包問題」。</p>
<p>無線電話的售價，今年將跌得出乎意料之外。雖然是十一燈十二燈的收音機，也只售十塊八塊錢一架，而將每家都裝置着。但是彈詞家將大感缺乏，而有人開設彈詞速成學校以應需求。「敎育」，今年將特别發逹，而更其是大學，將多量的增加，而且將仿銀行的制度，分設着「南北分校」，「北市分校」之類，一方可便利學生，一方可增進敎育效能。罷課，驅長等風潮，不再發生，因爲與學生不能「感情融洽」的敎師，必然是一打就倒的。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回　　　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　　　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>江氏連忙向桂枝摇了幾下手道：别提了，夜靜更深。何必吵了别個街坊睡罷。桂枝看了他母親一眼，又躺下了。江氏也無心再作女紅，收起了針綫，在担屜裹面找出半截烟捲頭，一個人坐着抽了一陣，也就睡覺了。到了次日起來，對於昨天晚上的事，心裹還不免有些掛念。可是桂枝起床而後，一切照常，並不覺得有昨天晚上那件事一樣。江氏自己也怕這件事讓趙翁知道了，是老大不便，又何嘗敢說什麽。當日桂枝在家裹做完了瑣事以後，便拿出了箱子裹的布料，自縫了一件小褂子穿，並未出屋門。直等晚半天，江氏呌他上街去買一塊豆腐來作晚飯吃，他就笑道：媽，你的記心，怎麽這樣子壤，我不是對你說了，從今天起，不出大門口了嗎？江氏道：你還同我生氣啦。只要有正經事……桂枝不等說完，搶着答道：我沒有什麽正經事要出去做的。他是坐在紙窗户下一張方凳子上縫纫衣服，說完了這句話，就將身子用力一偏，表示那十分决絕的樣子。江氏看到他有生氣的趨勢，就不敢向下說什麽了，自己去買了豆腐來作晚飯吃。其實桂枝並不是生氣，他覺得母親所說的話，很有道理，積之旣然回海甸來，一出大門，彼此就有見面的機會。自己被感情束縛着，又不能見了人家，置之不理。萬一再作一度談話，那就不定會生出多少是非。爲了免除這種糾紛起見，乾脆，只有不出門了。果然，自這天起，大門口便是倒下天來，他也不過問。（二八五）</p>

<h3>養魚哲學</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>「魚，我所欲也；熊掌亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍魚而取熊掌者也。」雖然我們的孟夫子抱的是純一地勢不兩立的比較性的向上哲學，可是魚總歸是好吃的，値得養育的東西；人類有一日存在世界，個個便應有吃魚的權利；不應和居士，和尙，尼姑們，今天收，明天放，後天又收又放，循環不已地演把戲。無論冰天雪地的人們，人人應有養魚的必要企圖。</p>
<p>不幸生而爲中國人，外侮迭乘，天災連年，内戰又頻仍，使你死不得，活不得；公說公有理，婆說婆有理，更使你哭笑不得；於是乎我勸大家養魚！大家大養其魚！惱！看那錦麟游泳，優哉游哉，正可聊以座歲而無憂。</p>
<p>看那過去蜀漢丞相诸葛亮先生，在建興元年秋八月，魏調五路大兵來取西川，軍馬甚是利害，亮，數日不出視事，後主大驚，卽差近侍齊旨，宣召孔明入朝，使命去了半日，回報丞相染病不出，後主轉慌；又命黄門侍郎，諫議大夫告以大事去，二人到丞相府前，皆不得入，歎息而回；次日衆官又來丞相府侍候，從早至晚，又不見出，多官惶惶·只得散去；隔天，後主阿斗引多官入宮啓奏皇太后，太后大驚，要邁老步自往；幸虧董允搬出太廟一奏，纔仗起阿斗的膽子親往，車駕至相府，門吏慌忙拜伏於地而迎；後主問說：「丞相在何處？」門吏說：「不知在何處。只有丞相鈞旨，敎擋住百官，勿得擅入。」後主乃下車步行，獨進第三重門，原來孔明獨倚竹杖，怡然在小池邊觀魚；你看孔明先生蕭然自得，應付裕如，多麽富於鴻猷謀略，具一百二十分的良相風度；饒有養魚哲學的思潮呢！</p>
<p>再上看那極普遍民間的通俗觀念的那崛起西周的武王以有天下的師尙父姜太公呂尙，滿臉鬍鬚，於思於思，他老人家偌大年紀，坐在渭水河邊，讓他王孫們，庶子們，以及太子，你來我往，卑躬折節，作揖打恭，一槪置之不理，幽默地只管說：</p>
<p>「釣！釣！釣！釣！釣！釣！大魚不來小魚來！」</p>
<p>必須周文王親身拉八百零八拉，是多麽的韻事；你不妨在養魚池邊，模擬你是個武鄕侯，姜太公，該多麽的够味兒啦！</p>
<p>况且「魚相濡以沫，」我們看了魚的動作，只要你有神經，不管健全與衰弱，偶一思索，便會發生對同類互相親愛的情緒呢！</p>
<p>至於「子非魚，安知魚之樂？」「子非我，安知我不知魚之樂？」「子固非魚也！」那是古代超人派的關於魚的另一回逸事。</p>
<p>「物競天擇，優勝劣敗！」我們當將自已養的魚鼎烹在自已鍋子裹，送到自已的口裹，同時應意識着吃的味美的是人，供給的犠牲品的是魚；要想像國家强盛的光榮與我們同魚不知不覺不掙扎而亡國的慘痛！</p>
<p>中國民族年來，已到千鈞一髮的緊要關頭，簡直成爲釜中之魚；看看養魚，只要有天良麽人，自會觸目驚心；地盤是什麽？權利是什麽？打他娘的幹嗎？這，又是多麽可以養成化除私心的哲學意味呢！</p>

<h3>談說謊</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>前些天在某刋物上掁見老友曹英寫了一篇「說謊讚」，名雖爲讚，其實是把說謊講到令人可怕的程度了，特别是關於說謊與昇官發財的關係，他論得異常透澈。他雖然也承認說謊有好意的和惡意的分别，但他所講的却只是那最惡的一面。</p>
<p>對於說謊的微妙的心理，我時常發生着極大的興趣，稍加研究，那的確是非常複雜的。幾年前我曾譯過日本谷崎精二作的一個短篇小說，題名就是「謊」。據他的解釋：</p>
<p>「說謊的這種事，一定是一種精神病。正如那絲毫不愁生活的貴婦人們，在洋貨店裹看見了一些零碎應用的物件就想要偷去是一樣的；他們在某種機會，一接觸到謊話的誘惑，無論如何便不能不說謊了。更滴切地說罷，他們要對於所有的人們表示好意，要供給所有的人們以他們所希欲的東西，則自己的力量又不足，於是就把事實虚構了，簡直可以說是一種氣弱的博愛主義者。當然，在世上那種出於可賤的利己的動機，說謊以騙世人，而謀自身的榮逹，那的確也是有的，但前邊所說的Ｋ書店的伙計與我的舊友時永君等，絕不是這種利己的意識的說謊。他們是明知結果要招來自身的消滅，而仍禁不住要說謊的這麽一種不幸的精神病的好人。」</p>
<p>谷崎氏的這篇小說的故事也就是所謂Ｋ書店的伙計和時永君的說謊的故事，這說來是頗爲有趣的事。</p>
<p>Ｋ書店請來一個伙計，對於書店的事好像非常地熱心，到處接洽出版的稿件，每次從外面跑回來，不是說同着某某博士費了九牛二虎之力談判好什麽書籍，就是同某某名作家約定了什麽小說稿件，甚至有一次喝醉了酒回來，還講是某某博士請客，因爲他們談話很投機。可是交涉好的稿子，却總不見他拿來，問他，他又總有理由，暫時吱唔過去。最後老板再也不能忍耐，親自找到所謂某某博士或某某作家去，這才曉得壓根兒沒有那麽一回事，老板盛怒之下，把那伙計散了了事。像這樣的說謊，確實不能講是含有怎樣惡意的，充其量只能說因爲一時的吹牛而害了說謊的神經病。</p>
<p>至於那小說中的時永君的說謊，眞可以說是頗有唐·吉訶德的精神了，爲救人暫時的痛苦而給人惹下更大的災難。時永君是一個大說謊家，故事很多，害人最甚的一次謊是這樣的：　　同是在一個學校裹的學生，有一個名武藤的，因爲害病，缺了過多的席，到了斯哥德的「湖上與美人」這課考試的時候，感到非常的困難，偶然遇到時永君，就把這苦衷閒談着講给他聽了。這位時永君一時神經病發作，信口開河，便說敎「湖上與美人」的敎授是他的親戚，可以設法帮忙，請敎授把考試題預先通知他。過了兩天時永君果然得到考試題目了，而且還嘱咐武藤絕對保持秘密，這樣武藤是非常安心，素性就無需凖備了。但是到了考試的時候，才知道時永君講的題目，完全。自撰的，而且他也不是某敎授的姪兒！</p>
<p>這說謊顯然更沒有什麽惡意，而不能不說是一種精神病了。</p>
<p>我想，就以以上的二例來看，不管爲自己的地位的堅固而說謊也吧，或爲了拯救旁人的困難而說謊也吧，都是含着有弱者的欲望與現實的不合的原因在，雖是一個弱者，他也會想如果能這樣，那就多麽好，可是一信嘴說出來，那就成了大謊了。但也有非說謊便不能越過某種難關的塲合，而這塲合也是弱者遇到的時候較多，大槪也就是因此爲什麽女人講謊話要比男人來得多。</p>
<h3>「戴寳林究竟是誰？」——質「新中華」編者</h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>爲了想看看一位朋友底文章，特地買了一本第一卷第十八期的「新中華。」看看目次，使我得着了意外的滿意。因爲除了我想看看的文章外，上面還載着幾篇關於黑格爾和費爾巴哈的哲學論文。自己一向是喜歐歡讀點哲學的人，而且比較是喜歡讀黑格爾和費爾巴哈的人，這個意外的滿意自然應該爲我所得着。於是，我便充着一腦的希望洋洋地翻下去　　翻到正文，在前面又現出徴求讀者批評的啓事。我覺得編輯先生底這種態度更是値得敬重的，接着希望也就擴大了。假使啓事是眞誠的話，想來編輯先生是很希望有批評出現的，否則便會失望吧。以如此充滿一腦的希望和敬重編輯先生的我，自然不能不仔細地讀下去了，怕的是有負編輯先生底一番好意。</p>
<p>結果，編輯先生底希望，總算沒有落空，然而失望却落在我這一邊。這失望，彷彿那用糖紙包着的藥丸一樣，吃起來是怪苦的。但不知道：到底是編輯先生所用的糖紙太薄乃至已經破綻了呢，還是由於我太細細地咀嚼了才討着苦吃的呢？好在編輯先生正在徴求讀者底意見或批評，而且有啓事爲證，故敢於作一個讀者將自己底意見提出，也可以算是一點批評。</p>
<p>首先我就要問：「戴寳林究竟是誰？」　　很顯然的，大家一眼就可以見着在「戴寳林」這個署名之上有一篇文章呌做「黑格爾邏輯的結構及其批評。」我相信一般讀者都會以爲這是一篇創作而且以爲中國有了「戴寳林」這位哲學理論家出現了。然而，這却是一個奇蹟，這却是中國文化界底一大發明。</p>
<p>所謂「黑格爾邏輯的結構及其批評」這篇文章，原來是從蘇俄「馬克思｜恩格斯研究所」刋行的俄文「黑格爾著作集」第一卷（第二版）底序言中割裂偸取來的。該序言爲Ａ．Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ所作，在日本已經有了川内唯彥氏底譯文獨立標題爲「辯證法」（正）和「黑格爾論理學批判」出版。全書共八萬餘言，分十三節，而這裹所割裂偸取的就是其中的九｜九兩節，簡直沒有什麽增減。</p>
<p>當我讀到這篇文章的時候，起初很高興，眞的以爲中國已經有關於黑格爾的研究底成果了。繼而覺得是自己讀過的東西，終於發見這一個奇蹟，只得拍案呌絶。</p>
<p>「戴寳林這個名字亦可以算是Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ底譯音」我又回頭這樣想過。也許這就是早已機心地埋伏着的回答。</p>
<p>但是，那末，爲什麽要在别人底全文中割裂兩節出來，旣不聲明摘譯，又不注明原著，而只署上一個十分酷肖中國</p>
<p>人名的「戴寳林」作爲一篇論文發表呢？爲什麽不譯爲已在中國流行的「德波林」或將譯者姓名列出，以表示「戴寳林」是原作者呢？到底「戴寳林」是代表原作者還是譯者呢？斷不能說「戴寳林」是一個因慕Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ而名的譯者以代表Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ自任所取的雙關名字來代表作者與譯者雙方的吧？要說是疏忽天地間决沒有這樣奇特的疏忽，要說是成例「新中華」就沒有這樣古怪的成例，在「戴寳」林這三個字底本身不是正包含着另外的意義嗎？接着這些問題便對我襲來。　　這却不能不求另外的解釋了。</p>
<p>近幾年來，很產出了一些反對『硬譯』的『軟』譯家。因爲他們所要的是軟工夫，究竟過不得硬，所以雖然在不懂原文的讀者讀來到還覺得是軟綿綿的，但偶爾亦有一些懂外國文的人依然在當讀者，有時反轉要以原文作證說硬的是眞貨而軟的是贋品。於是，另一條小道和出口又爲這些人開了：那便是將外人底文章東抄西襲來作爲一篇著作直接署上自己底名字發表。自然這種辦法比以前那種軟譯更加乖巧：第一，使人難於找着東西來對照出錯誤而且落得一個著作家的頭銜；第二，自己事前就可以只擇自己能懂的東西抄襲，卽使别人要來對照也不容易捉着已經逃走了的錯誤；第三，只要粗粗地讀了幾本書或半通一點外國文就可以從事抄襲，至少比學好了外國文再來翻譯要來得快些。這樣一來，結果以前那些不通和半通外國文的人或就是只能軟譯的人都變成著作家了，因而同時也就有了一種專門騙取沒有能力讀外國書的靑年學生底銅板的只登些講義似的煩瑣文章的雜誌產生，甚至還有以著作自封永遠未登載過一篇譯文而詡爲批判的建設的理論雜誌的，好像連世界上最有權威的理論家底著作都不如我們底著作家們的，所以完全値不得介紹了。現年『新中華』居然很痛快地將别人底文章活生生地割裂兩節出來冒充中國人底一篇論文發表，實不外是如上所云之登峯造極，而『戴寳林』三字只不過是以備萬一人家攻擊起來便於隠身的逃所而已。</p>
<p>然而，編輯先生終歸是逃不掉的：要說是『戴寳林』就是Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ，那末這個抄譯者便成爲「無」而其責任應該由編輯先生負，想來幾元錢一千字的稿費决不會兌給遠在俄國的Ｄｅｂｏｒｉｎ亦不會就近交給「無」吧；要說是譯者原附有名字乃至聲明幷無冒充偸取之嫌，那末這種責任就更應該由編輯先生負了，而且這種責任决不是以疏忽等辭所能卸掉的。據說確有一些編輯先生不必代人受過而將這位『戴寳林』給我們交出，所以爲了便利以後說話和敬重編輯先生以免受其累起見，最後再向編輯先生質問一聲：</p>
<p>『戴寳林究竟是誰？』</p>
<h3>街頭戲劇家</h3>
<p>— 靑農</p>
<p>一天的午後，偶然站在樓前，望望天，雲在飛着；望望街頭，汽車在馳着，人在閒散地走着，對過馬路的人行道上一個街頭戲劇家剛剛放下他的行頭箱子。這街頭戲劇家出演的戲劇，就是民間流行的布袋戲，亦名獨脚戲。我的心被他吸引住了。</p>
<p>小孩子的時候，雖然在街頭常常看見這些戲劇家演着獨脚戲，但是人小心大，老是看不起牠，幷不停步一觀；究竟他怎麽演怎麽唱曲我都不大淸楚，這回却下了决心想要乍牠一個究竟。</p>
<p>他將挑行頭箱子的木棍插進一頭行頭箱子，抬起來靠壁放着，那在上面的行頭箱子一揭開，獨脚戲的舞台立刻出現；將圍着的灰黑布幕張開垂下來，又將那另一頭的行頭箱子推進布幕裹面，人不鑽進布幕，站在那行頭箱子上面或是後面，鑼鼓立刻響起來了。舞台裝置的技巧眞是高明，你看那麽簡單便當。</p>
<p>鑼鼓響了一回，在舞台前面已經站了好多不知從什麽地方跑來的小孩子，婦女，和過路的男人，忽然在舞台上出現了一個古裝的女人，兩手左右前後地擺着，身子也在舞台上的左右前後四面八方轉着，那是劇中人在走路。那古裝的女人站在舞台的中央唱曲了，這是一種江浙流行的小調兒，不知道在唱的什麽。那古裝的女人唱了一陣，又在舞台上的左右前後四面八方轉着，忽然停在舞台的右邊角上了。又出現了一個古裝男人，有帽子而沒有扇子，（小孩子的時候，曾經看過一個古裝的男人頭戴着帽子手拿着扇子的，）也是兩手左右前後地擺着，身子在舞台上的左右前後四面八方轉着，站在舞台的中央唱着。那男主角唱了一回，女主角又站在舞台的中央來唱，兩人都唱了，兩人又在說白，忽然兩人一起地走一走，走進去了，｜｜是忽然遁下舞台底下去了。</p>
<p>那街頭戲劇家演完了戲，從布幕裹頭鑽出來，手裹拿着一個舊爛的香筒子向觀衆要錢。過路的男人是走開了，小孩子跑得更快，婦女們也移動了她們的脚步，結果只見一兩個老媽子從腰包裹掏出銅板給他。</p>
<p>演了好一回戲，只得了一兩個銅板，在這個年頭，街頭戲劇家的生意也是不景氣了！</p>
<p>可是，那街頭戲劇家幷不灰心，又鑽進布幕裹頭去，立刻鑼鼓又響了，而且還加上口技的笛聲，舞台上又出現了人物，這回却是一個有白鬍子的老人。那老人也是轉着，唱着，又停住在舞台的右邊角上。然後另一個人物上塲，｜｜這回也是一個古裝的女人｜｜轉着，唱着。又是兩人都唱了，兩人還在說白，又是忽然兩人一起地走一走，遁下舞台底下去了。</p>
<p>那街頭戲劇家這回仍舊沒有得到幾個銅板，因爲天色已晩，也只得拆了舞台，挑起走了。　　我自始至終站在樓前看着，忽然感到唱獨脚戲雖然並不怎樣困難，但也就未免寂寞，苦悶與悲哀！人生的街頭，唱獨脚戲的人何能算少，他們的寂寞，苦悶，悲哀，有誰了解呢？</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七）（九）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>她咕嘟道：「一個年輕的姑娘嫁着一個像我那樣的丈夫實在是可怕極了。」哲安沒有回答他在想着自己至今以爲是他兒子的那人，也許他多時以來便覺得自己父親是平凡的那種模糊的觀念，他哥哥對父親的不變的諷刺，旁人對父親的含着輕蔑的冷淡，甚至女僕對父親的輕侮等等，都使他的心靈對於母親的那番可怕的告白早有準備。因爲這種種原因，他知道自己是另一個人的兒子時，也就不十分傷心了；並且經過前夜的激烈的感動之後，他其所以沒有羅蘭夫人所擔心着的激發的反動，憤慨和惱怒者，那是因爲他許久以來便不知不覺地因感到自己是這正直的愚人的兒子而苦痛着的緣故。</p>
<p>他們走到了陸醉米太太家的門口。</p>
<p>她住在靠聖亞勒絲路的她自己所有的一座大建築的三樓上。從她那房子裹的窗户望去，整個哈佛爾海灣盡在眼底。</p>
<p>當她看見那走在前面進來的羅蘭夫人時，她不像平時一樣伸出手來和好握手，却張開兩臂抱吻着她，因爲她早已猜到她的來意了。</p>
<p>客廳裹面那華美的天鵝絨的傢具是一直罩着套子的。糊着花紙的壁上，掛着她第一個丈夫｜船長買的四幅畫。這四幅畫都代表着一些海洋的感傷的塲面。我們在第一幅畫上可以見到一個漁人的女人在海岸上招展着手帕，而那載着她丈夫的帆船正要在水天交接處消失不見了。在第二幅畫上，那同一的女人跪在同一的海岸上，一面絞着自己的手臂，一面眼望着遠處，在一個完滿着閃電的天空下，在那波濤泅湧的海面，她丈夫乘着的小船快要沉沒了。其餘的兩張畫却代表着上流社會裹的和這相類似的塲面。</p>
<p>一個金髮的少婦把肘靠在一隻開行了的大郵船的船沿上夢想着。她以一種被眼涙潤濕了的顯得悵惘的眼睛瞪着那距離已遠的海岸。</p>
<p>她後面留下了誰呢？</p>
<p>隨後，那同一的少婦坐在一張對大海開着的窗户傍邊，她暈倒在一張沙發椅上。一封信從她的膝上落　到地氈上。</p>
<p>他竟死了，怎樣的悲痛啊！</p>
<p>來客大都被這幾個透澈而有詩味的主題的平凡的哀愁所感動，所誘惑。人們一見便懂得畫裹的意思，用不着解說，也用不着尋思，而人們便憫惜掁這些可憐的女人，雖然人們並不十分了然於這種最高貴的悲哀的性質。但這懹疑也可助人幽想。她該是失去了她的未婚夫呀！一進門，人們的眼睛便不由自主地被這四張畫引去了，並且像遇着一種誘惑似的被吸住了。就有時離開，也老是要轉回來的，並且老是欣賞着這彷彿姊妹似的兩個女人的四種表情。從這明潔，妥善，週到，像時行彫刻那樣大方的畫面，和光亮的畫框上最易獲得的是一種淸潔且方正的感覺，這種感覺被其餘的佈置烘托得更加明顯。</p>
<p>坐椅都照着一種不變的秩序排列着，一部分靠牆擺着，一部分圍着小圓桌擺着。沒有污點的白色窗幔，有着那樣正直有規則的折紋，簡直使人想要把牠稍稍弄皺一下；那罩着金色的帝國風的時鐘｜一個像擺在屋子裹的瓜一般熟的由跪了的亞特拉（Ａｔｌａｓ）肩負着的地球｜的玻璃鐘罩是從來不會蒙上一粒灰屑的。</p>

<h3>一年來之上海公債市塲</h3>
<p>— 心璧</p>
<p>「債市之起伏，時局之寒暑表也」，信哉斯語，我人固習聞之矣。蓋自民國十六年以來，戰禍匪患，各地騷然，農耕失時，商業慘落，内地殷實商賈，爲環境所迫，紛紛遷居，來滬寄寓，而各地之游資，亦隨之而俱來，因之近數年來，各種金融機關莫不存欵充斥，而地產公債之投機，則爲僅有之業務。坐是而公債市塲，倍見繁榮，交易所中，高朋滿座，投機者興高彩烈，巨額公債，亦連年發行。銀行以公債爲凖備，廣事鈔票之推行，發行數額，增加彌速。此種通貨膨脹之現象，在當事者非慒然莫覺，而有識者深慮危機隠伏，設有風浪驀起不知其伊於胡底焉。</p>
<p>無何民國二十年夏，長江大水，沿江各地，盡成澤國，公債市塲首受影響。至九一八遼變發生，債劵價格，暴落益甚，繼以次年一二八之滬變，金融又見呆滯，市塲停業，凡三閱月。開業後，雖因基金指定的欵，市價漸見穏定，然交易寥落，未能回復已往之繁榮。至民國二十二年初，時局依然，其先有日軍之進犯熱河濼東，繼之又有察亂與方吉之變，而閩省獨立復殿其後，因是全年之公債市塲，雖在塘沽恊定簽字與夫美綿麥借欵成功之時，一度暴騰，終以國家多故，政治未能長此樂觀，而又見慘落，所幸一二八後，新債劵尙少發行，市面籌碼枯竭，銀根鬆動，金融界逐月買進，散户實貨，愈搜愈枯，雖有二十年赈災與二十年金融兩種新債之開拍，與二十二年關稅庫劵一萬萬元之發行，債市尙能安穏過去，未受多大之影響。其逐月之經過如下：</p>
<p>（一月份）　年初以日軍突又進犯，楡關陷落，各債劵紅盤開出，卽跌逾一板而停拍，綿亘數日，未見起色。嗣以遠近期市價接近，套頭利息優厚，始有轉機。然後半月，則因外交情勢混沌，北方對日軍事，無新發展，加之迫近廢曆年節與交割，各業均在收縮期内，以是市塲人心，非常沉靜，而債劵趨勢，始終呆滯也。</p>
<p>（二月份）　春節假後，成交初極寥落，惟以國際形勢，似乎稍轉和緩，市上人心，乃有進步。然鉅額成交，未之見焉。其後日人努力增兵，爲侵擾華北及熱何之準備，空氣漸緊，人心虚弱，但以金融界收進踴躍，價格尙能支持耳。</p>
<p>（三月份）　及熱河戰起，赤峯凌源告危，債市則因籌碼枯竭，銀行界又　批買進，反而逐日堅漲。至美國金融潮發生，標金猛跌，債市亦有一度之風波。終以人心看好，市况欣欣向榮，後雖津謡再起，影響甚少，而能冉冉上升也。</p>
<p>（四月份）　淸明節後，消息紛紜，市塲混亂，變動甚烈。及濼東戰事失敗，秦島有北戴河喜峯口等地相繼被陷，廣帮北帮銀行咸集中於抛空之一途，債市因而步落。至交割期近，空氣突然良好，益以日軍之遽撤至長城各口，人氣倍形高昂，逐日市價，激漲至巨。</p>
<p>（五月份）　五月初消息混沌，起伏至微，五九國恥後，雖以謡言紛繁，而又唐山陷落，密雲吃緊，以至一再跌落。迨黄郛北上，市價卽飛黄騰逹。至華北戰事停止，和平聲浪高漲，向之悲觀論者，紛紛買進，尤以北帮銀界，進胃最濃也。</p>
<p>（六月份）　迨塘沽恊定簽字，人心振奮，市價扶摇直上，邁步前進，成交盛况，幾與九一八前相伯仲。更以五千萬美金棉麥大借之成功，而得一大助力，投資者之心理，頼以堅强。雖察事發生，而新高價仍層出不窮焉。</p>
<p>（七月份）　銀行結賬之後，進出頗不一致。惟因新興金融機關之買進，與北帮之補空，市價日在堅漲之中。本年之最高紀錄，亦於此時產生。特　面狹隘，苟有巨量供求，變化輒起。至大連會議成功，挺進更烈。迨及察事惡化，始起反動。然而漲跌類似盤旋，各方均以廬山會議之開展爲依歸也。</p>
<p>（八月份）　月初以察事與政局之迷離，趨勢殊爲不利。復有新債之謡，市况益趨黯淡。及察事急轉直下，乃突然堅漲。旣而某方面賣金短，而黃河又有洪水之患，於是大户散户，力懹戒心，恐蹈二十年份之覆轍也。</p>
<p>（九月份）　九月初旬，因時局無重要發展，市塲淸淡，進出希少。迨廬山會議進行須利，國共又稍形和平，市氣以之稍堅。然而新債之說，死灰復燃，人氣更現蕭條徘徊之象。幸而方吉之變，旋告失敗，軒然大波，得消弭於無形耳。</p>
<p>（十月份）　一萬萬元二十二年關稅庫劵之發行，已於本月份見諸事實，而汪蔣宋辭職之謡，亦起於此時。然交易方面，銀界有巨價之吸收，故國慶前後，市價類見堅漲。迨後多頭充斥，市面轉見不穏，而銀界受押新關稅後，頗有傾售統鹽，藉以調劑之趨勢。及財宋辭職之說又起，傾吐甚巨，債市猛降，然月終則以補空而又轉較高漲。　　（十一月份）　新舊財長交替之時，人心恍惚，乍漲乍跌，雖未見巨大波瀾，然今後之變化，則方興未艾也。無何閩省政謡，油然而起，散户多頭，首呈恐慌，紛紛出籠，良好市况，乃一蹶不振，而四月前之低價，又現於我人之眼簾矣。</p>
<p>（十二月份）　自閩變發生，市况極度紊亂，起伏靡常，旋因金融界及大户競事吸收，猛漲數日。復以時局混沌，而呈盤旋之象，後以交割期近，空頭遭軋，再度邁步前進。並以年結將屆。銀界競謀拉提，以繁榮賬面，債市頼以扶植，然而閩浙戰事已起，消息混沌，以致再見回風也。</p>
<p>全年債市經過，略如上述。至其現貨交易之最高最低市價與折扣，有如下表，（各項公債市價，原票面係一百元，故市價等於折扣，無須另列），</p>

<p>又開拍期貨之債劵，共計十五種，除以上十二種外，尙有二十年金融，二十年賑災（近來無交易），與行將開拍之二十二年關稅等三種，此等債劵，以鹽稅與裁兵兩種，最稱活躍，起伏甚速，爲投機者着目之鵠的。二十關統稅，與二十年捲烟（俗稱四捲卽第四次捲烟庫劵）次之，編遣，一九關稅，一九善後，整理六厘，二十年金融等又次之，其他數種，則交易有限矣。</p>
<h3>蘇浙京滬杭五省市之地方公債</h3>
<p>— 逖君</p>
<p>地方公債爲各省市縣政府發行之公債。自民元迄今，各地年有發行，名目之多，且遠勝於中央内債。其用途指定建設事業者，固非少數，然而因政費虧短而募集者，數亦不少。如四川廣東兩省，更巧立名目，巨額發行，但求當前財政困難之補苴，枉論日後擔負之綦重。茲以篇幅所限，先就蘇浙京滬杭五省市發行地方公債，得明其一斑也。</p>
<p>（一）江蘇省　江蘇之省公債，以民元之江蘇公債爲噙矢。民十以後，又有增比債劵，災歉善後公債，建設公債，及與浙江省共同發行之江浙絲業短期公債等多種，除已經償還與尙無確實擔保之增比債劵外，其他三種還本付息，尙能按期舉行，茲略述如下；</p>
<p>（一）江蘇國家分金庫災歉善後公債　此項公債，係民國十一年發行，定額七百萬元，年利一分，以該省貨物稅爲擔保。惟還本兩次後，因軍事而停頓。至民國十九年，始擬定分十二年攤還，每年抽籤七支，而利息則按成案免際，指定准南蘇五屬及皖岸鹽斤加價爲的欵，自民國二十年一月起，繼續抽籤，至今前後還本八次，抽籤四十二支，共還本金二百九十四萬文　　（二）江蘇省建設公債　建設公債，爲興辦各種建設事業而募集，定額亦爲七百萬元，於十九　　二十兩年分兩期發行，年息八厘，以全省典賣田房契稅收入爲基金，至今已還本六支，抽籤十四支，共還本金一百四十萬元。</p>
<p>（三）民國二十一年江浙絲業短期公債　此欵由江蘇浙江兩省共同發行，定額三百萬元，專充救濟兩省絲繭業之用，指定於財政部撥付兩省裁厘恊欵項下，按期撥付，利率年息六厘，自民國二十一年十一月撥行迄今，已還本五次，抽籤三十一支，共還本金九十三萬元。</p>
<p>㈡浙江省　浙省之有公債，以民元軍政府愛國公債爲始，十二年後又繼續發行定期借欵四次，與善後·整欠·償欠·公路·建設·振災·淸欠·及與江蘇省共同發行之江浙絲業短期公債等八種，除先後淸償與收回外，尙有下列七種，未曾淸償。且二十年冬以度支竭厥，而加整理，指定該省鹽附稅田賦帶征建設特附兩捐，普通營業稅四種稅收，每年撥銀四百四十萬元爲償還債務基金。</p>
<p>（一）浙江省償還舊欠公債　此項債票，發行於民國十七年，用以償還十五六年軍興以來之省内外借墊軍用各欵，定額六百萬元，週息一分，自第四年起償還，至今已還本五次，抽籤二十三支，共還本金一百三十八萬元。</p>

<p>（三）民國十八年浙江省建設公債　民國十八年募集者爲建設公債，定額一千萬元，充興築該省杭江鐵路杭徽公路及擴充電氣事業修治錢江水利之用，年息八厘，還本已及八次，抽籤三十一支，共還本金三百十萬元。</p>
<p>（四）民國十九年浙江省賑災公債　十八年夏秋之交，水旱風虫，相繼肆虐於浙省，民廳以災情重大，提請省府發行振災公債一百萬元，年息八厘，於十九年七月舉行，至今還本七次，抽籤二十四支，共還本金二十四萬元。</p>
<p>（五）民國二十年浙江淸理舊欠公債　民國二十年夏，浙省府爲淸理近數年預算虧短各項積欠借欵，發行淸欠公債八百萬元，年息八厘，迄今已還本五次，抽籤十二次，共還本金九十六萬元。</p>
<p>（六）民國二十一年浙江省短期金庫劵　省金庫劵發行於民國二十一年七月，以彌補預算虧短爲目的，定額六百萬元，月息五厘，截至二十二年底，已還本二次，共還本金四十八萬元。</p>
<p>（七）民國二十一年江浙絲業短期公債　此欵係與江蘇省共同發行，已詳見於前，茲不贅述。</p>

<p>㈣上海市　上海市之發行公債，以民國十一年之整理路政公債爲最早，其後又續發整理橋路公債與豫園公債兩種，至市府成立，又先後發行市政公債，與災區復興公債兩種。</p>

<p>（二）上海災區復興公債　一二八戰事後，各項稅收短絀，當經市政當局呈准國府，發行公債六百萬元，爲整理災區道路橋樑溝渠及辦理其他善後建設救濟事宜之用，年息七厘，指定碼頭收入爲基金，由上海英商利安洋行承銷，並委托匯豐銀行經会本息，市政府係按票面八折實收，自民國二十一年十一月發行至今，已還本二次，抽籤二支，共還本金十二萬元。</p>
<p>㈤杭州市　浙江省杭州市爲建設自來水廠，於民國十九年七月，發行公債二百五十萬元，定名爲浙江省杭州市自來水公債，年息八厘，以該市土地稅收入及自來水廠營業盈餘爲擔保，十九年份發行者僅一百五十萬元，嗣於二十二年份又續發五十萬元，民國二十二年十二月第一次還本，抽籤一支，還本二萬元。</p>

<h3>倫敦之中國債劵市塲</h3>
<p>— 建初</p>
<p>倫敦交易所，所開拍之中國債劵，計可分爲兩大類，一係中央財政借欵，所發行之債劵，凡以關稅担保之英德續借欵，及善後大借欵，鹽稅担保之克利斯浦，英法借欵，及湖廣鐵路借欵，與以庚子賠欵作担保之中法債劵等俱屬焉。一係鐵路借欵，多以鐵路資產，及營業收入爲担保，計有北寗，京滬，廣九，滬杭甬，津浦，津浦續，隴海，及道淸等數種。</p>
<p>歷年以來，我國内亂相仍，外侮薦臻，財政羅掘幾窮，點金乏術，對於海外債劵之信用，雖勉事維持，而岌岌可危，時虞崩潰，到期本息之延付，乃屢見於事實矣。鐵路債劵，則因頻年軍興，擾及路政，路欵挪用殆盡，營業收入，摧毁無餘，而路債之信用，亦復摇摇欲墜，外人對於中國國外債券之興趣，遂逐漸减少矣。</p>
<p>按現在倫敦市塲，所開拍之中國國外債券，其票面單位，除中法美金，爲美金五百元外，其餘類多爲英金百鎊。然因我國財政困難，金融枯竭之故，國外債券之倫敦市價，舍英德續借欵，有較好之現象外，其餘皆與票面價格，相去甚遠，此亦足以爲外人對於中國國外債劵，興趣减少之一明證也。惟財政當局，鑒於債信之亟待恢復，無容或緩，整理週轉不遺餘力，故一年以來，倫敦之中國國外債券，經過堅。至八九月間，中央外債，驟形秀麗，有四鎊至十鎊之上漲，而鐵路債劵，亦於九十月間，突轉漲風，惟馬可尼與威克斯，及北寗與廣九兩路債券，則自前年十一月以來，卽呈呆滯狀態，故無行市紀錄，茲將去年倫敦中國國外債券之全年最高及最低行市，列表於左，以便參考。</p>

<h3>戰爭與靑年</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>雖然英工黨老將漢德森在擺出他那「固特異」式之生膠質的面皮爲「軍縮」「和平」而畫夜奔忙着；但是，不僅「軍擴」已經成爲各帝國主義間之儘量爭先的競賽，就是二次世界戰爭危機的與日俱近，也差不多成爲路人皆知的事。近東的德國和遠東的中國，一向是被人們認爲匯聚國際間之各種危險和矛盾的兩大「火山」：現在，這遥遥相對的兩大「火山」都在噴出可怕的熱流和濃烟，大的爆發，只是時間問題而已。</p>
<p>當然，華爾街的財閥，「大王」們，三菱三井的巨頭們，是不會在世界戰爭的血景展開時，躬臨前線的：而「該死」的，被種種的威迫利誘送到前線去當砲灰，作打靶對象的，照例又是國際的靑年大衆！</p>
<p>看吧！做着「戰爭可以回復景氣」的迷夢，中風狂走的帝國主義者們是怎樣惟恐不及地把各該國的男女靑年羣衆向着戰爭的浩刦推送：</p>
<p>（一）華聯社東京電：日軍部以一九三五年爲對外戰爭之時期……陸軍省徴募課　　（管理募兵所關事宜）擬定新方針，改革各學校之軍事訓練方法，對於全國　　之大學專門學校一千四百十八校，學生七十三萬四千六百零二人，加以嚴　　格之實戰訓練……</p>
<p>（一）電通社東京電：日本婦人聯合會與日本聯合女子靑年團，因感男性非常時　　訓練之不足，總動員全國二千萬之婦人團員，興起非常時之女性訓練運動　　……以一九三六年爲目標，開始軍事生活之實際訓練運動。</p>
<p>（一）國民社柏林電：知近三個月内來自各大城市之德國靑年運動會員一百五十　　萬人，皆屬十歲至十八歲之男女，由總理希特拉命醫生檢騐體格後，其中　　有六萬人因體格不强，遣往鄕間操練……此外尙有男女童一千五百人，因　　身體太弱，已送入靑年療養院，政府决嚴格注意全國靑年之健康……。　（一）路透社羅馬電：法西斯蒂黨爲提倡意大利生育率起見，定十月三十日爲「　　結婚節」，屆時將有二千對男女舉行婚禮，禮畢，卽結隊游行，赴棒喝團　　總部領取首相慕沙里尼之贈品，同時聖彼得敎堂舉行嬰兒共同洗禮大典，　　首相將贈每人衣服一襲。又慕沙里尼最近向某一靑年集會演說，謂一九三　　四年將成爲意大利單身漢之「凶年」，意卽政府將不結緍者科以重稅也。　　從以上最近的消息中，我們可以看出：日本帝國主義者已經把全國靑年男女的大多數，加以「砲灰的预約」：希特拉非常關心於德國靑年的「健康」，但是我們把他這種「關心」和前此要求全德靑年都服從國社黨指導的演說以及在國聯掘强地要求德國軍備平等的黩武政策聯繋起來一看，就可以知道希特拉的主要努力，也是在使德國靑年「砲灰化」。意大利帝國主義不但忙於空軍競爭，忙於製造戰艦大砲，而且忙於製造「第二代的砲」！</p>
<p>以上的事實，卽充分向我們說明：在行將來到的帝國主義世界戰爭中，直接被犠牲，首蒙其害的，就是國際的靑年大衆；所以，歐戰以來，各國進步的靑年羣衆，不斷有爲自己的利益而反對帝國主義戰爭之英勇的鬭爭。處在帝國主義世界之對敵地位，隨時有受着帝國主義進攻之可能的蘇聯，最近曾由最高領袖發表演說，一面警告五百萬靑年團員，凖備以武力保衛國家，一面警告正在作反蘇聯戰爭之冒險嘗試的敵人：「爾輩愼勿向吾人試騐力量，否則將自焚也！」可見處在帝國主義對敵地位的國家或殖民地民族，只有在「武裝自衛」的朝野戒備之下，纔能保障和平及自己的安全，絕對不能向以屠殺爲職業的惡魔們祈禱或請求和平！至於中國靑年，在世界戰爭「山雨欲來風滿樓」的現階段，至少，應該有下列兩點的認識和把握：</p>
<p>第一，太平洋戰爭，就是帝國主義重行分割中國市塲的戰爭，屆時中國不但不能存「局内中立」或依附交戰國之某一帝國主義以自求苟延的幻想，而且整個海岸線和大部分的陸面，都不免淪爲帝國主義大屠殺的戰塲。</p>
<p>第二，在帝國主義戰爭中，無論誰勝誰敗，中國只有更陷於殖民地化，絕對不會再有一個類似巴黎和會的，與中國以喊寃訴苦的機會；所以，中國靑年爲了自己和民族的生存，除了從事反帝的民族戰爭以消減帝國主義的戰爭而外，絕無其他可走的出路！</p>
<h3>拓聲劇社公演參觀記</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>去年除夕的下午，友人林希雋君約到大上海戲院看「虚榮誤」，走到寗波同鄕會門口，在雙喜的彩排裹頭有一條横布條大字寫著「拓聲劇社首次大公演」，又一塊廣告板寫着演的戲是「天外」，這「拓聲劇社」記得是美專學校的學生參加前年「九一八」以後的「反日演劇大聯合」的一個愛美劇團，當時表演的成績给我的印象不壤，就很想進去參觀，他們演的劇本是「天外」，這劇本是美國著名的戲劇家奥尼爾的傑作，更想到非進去參觀不可。但是又看見一塊廣告板寫着「門票對面某纸烟店代售」，心想自來看演劇是沒有化過錢的，這回怕非破鈔不可了。忽然看見從裹頭走出來影星鄭君里君和導演蘇怡君，後面還有兩個小姐們，大家招呼過後，問他們買門票沒有，他們說和周伯動君一起進去的，正說着只見周君移動泰山似地從石級上將胖身體推動下來，機會眞巧，就問他怎麽進去的，他說趙丹君在裹頭找他們就行，我心裹有辦法了。但聽聽都是國華中學的學生組織，也好，不管誰組織的，「天外」這戲，是非看不可的。别了他們，急到隔壁大上海戲院找那位等着我看影戲的朋友林君，在看影戲的時候，心裹還在打算如何進去參觀「天外」的事。　　七點鐘從大上海戲院出來以後，急到大三元酒家吃飯，吃了飯林君别去。自己急步向西藏路走來。還便當｜說是客氣更對｜和守門的招待員說聲找趙丹先生，他們就請我進塲，又說在後臺。那裹我是熟的，便到後臺走去，進了門，那是化妝室，問聲趙丹先生在嗎？就有人將趙君呌出來，趙君伴出塲招呼招待員招待，他說後臺事忙進去了。我問了那位招待員要了一張戲單，被延到前排第三排一個空位坐下，隔壁是一位女士，心想大槪就是因爲有了那位女士所以沒有人坐了，眞是借她的光。這時戲已經開塲，只見臺上佈着鄕村之景，兩個男子坐在短垣上對話，一個脚穿着長</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>統黑皮靴，手拿着鶴嘴耙，像一個外國農夫，一個穿着平常家居的衣服，沒有黑皮靴也沒有鶴嘴耙，像一個學生。我知道那是兄弟兩人，才是第一幕的開塲。看下去那兄北兩人老是坐在短垣上面對話，眞是太呆板了，有點令人厭倦。等到那位哥哥亞安走了，上來一位美麗的姑娘，觀衆的面孔上都變成興奮的表情，我自己也振刷了精神留心看，可是那位姑娘路史又是和那位學生亞羅坐在短垣上對面。頭先那位學生對他的農夫哥哥說是堅决地要離開農村航海去，這回被那位美麗的姑娘說出她是在愛他的時候，他却說不去航海了，兩人接吻起來，在天願爲比翼鳥，在地願爲連理枝。接吻是假的，我看得出，但他們做得眞像，佩服佩服。這一對小情人從短垣後下去，第一幕也就閉了。</p>
<p>第一幕閉了以後，佈景的時間是那麽久，又沒有音樂來調劑觀衆的等待着之焦燥心，於是乎談話的聲音四起，全塲嘈嘈閙閙了，我心裹在怪着主人｜拓聲劇社｜爲什麽不設音樂隊？否則就是開開留聲機也好喲。同時又聯想到話劇的觀衆雖然是大多數學界中人，都是存敎育的智識份子，在佈景這一時之内，要大家嚴肅的靜默地耐心等待着開幕還是困難的事，以後的戲劇運動者是應該注意這一點，添以音樂才對。而且那音樂最好是正合已閉幕的情節，又轉入將開幕的情節，帮助劇情的進展那是有益　　第二幕一開塲，觀衆立刻肅靜下來，臺上是外國人的窮家庭的佈景，中央一張圓桌子圍着三個外國人，當中是一個老太婆，左手是一個老人家，右手是一個半丑角大腹賈：在大腹賈背後那壁角邊站着第一出塲的農夫哥哥亞安。圍在圓桌子的人在談着那一個要去航海的少年，父親和母親是反對的，那大腹賈的舅父却慫恿他去，說兩個兒子一個在家鄕種田，一個航海去做生意是多麽好。等一回，弟弟亞羅進來，告訴了爸和媽說是不去了。亞羅不去航海，爸和媽是喜歡的可是他不去的緣因却說是路史愛他，他願意在家裹種田，不去找求理想的天外，這話恰巧給愛路史的哥哥亞安聽到，他祝福他們而自己要離開農村土地航海去，這在爸爸是惱氣極了：亞安會種田要離開，亞羅不會種田怎麽負這責任呢？爸惱極責備一番，可是那航海商人舅父却喜歡着他替亞羅預備好了房艙，現在亞安去住也是一樣。｜在這一幕，各個角色的表演，都很能够將劇中人的個性以及在劇情中的動做表現出來；兩位老頭子尤其做得好。（未完）</p>
<h3>自殺的胎像</h3>
<p>— 麥夫</p>
<p>｜｜答弓百弟問｜｜</p>
<p>来函問我對於自殺的意見，弟，請聽吧：</p>
<p>一般人以爲自殺這伞事，雖然怪異悸人，然而却來得偉大。因爲自殺是痛苦的，捨生是最大難。而竟有人能毅然决的捨掉少躍躍的生命，塌心一死以了却人生的苦惱。這，如沒有一種大認識大勇氣，便决不能成功。所以這裹面蘊藏着一笙偉大的値得讚美的果决精神，而那般貪生畏死者流顯然是望塵莫及。　　這種人的說法，以爲一般人都是貪生的，而那堅强的生的意識，却怎樣都難得比擬於自殺的果敢精神。以爲一個人對於生的想　，能够這樣毅然的來對待，　誰怎樣都是偉大的。</p>
<p>這種說法只是一笙近近眞理，仔細的診察，我們就可以看出牠的理由的貧乏。</p>
<p>我覺得，一個人只能在人生裹表示他的偉大，因爲人生就是生活，人的偉大就純粹建築在以生命力來和艱苦的生活奮鬥的這上面。</p>
<p>死，有時候我也不否認牠是偉大的，然而那只限於某種範圍。譬如爲着獻身社會，爲着獻身人類，在牠的結果是在龐大意義的那點講，他是偉大的。若只是爲着自己的生活艱苦，或是爲着愛情的苦惱，以自殺來了結自己，那是怎樣說都不算是偉大，都不算是勇敢。</p>
<p>爲甚麽你不能和艱苦作鬥，爲甚麽你不從苦惱上面踏過去，而展開着你進一步的生路呢？</p>
<p>生的意義是只能儘着肉體的延續性而奮扎的生的。因爲現社會是充滿着黑暗和缺陷，自然每個生命都會遇到一些不如意的事情，然而這却正是磨礪我們人性偉大的地方。我們要從人性中建築起堅毅，卓絕，勇敢等偉大的地方來，這種不如意的事情，卽是說人生的諸般苦惱，是怎樣都不能加以拒絕和避免的。勇敢者是什麽呢？勇敢者是流着眼淚，咬住牙根，從痛苦，煩惱，艱惱，艱苦中踏步而過的人們！也祇有這般人們才値得我們稱爲偉大，才値得我們去極力讚揚。</p>
<p>至於自殺者，却是種不堪的畏怯的人物。</p>
<p>爲什麽會是不堪的畏怯的呢？簡單的說，就是他沒有和艱苦，煩悶作戰的毅然的精神，我們以爲以偸竊來維持他小孩的生命的人是比自殺者流，偉大百倍。爲什麽呢？根底是他認識着人生，認識着人生的眞諦。他認識這社會的缺陷，他要從這種社會的缺陷裹表現出那人性的偉大來。這較之於自殺者流，以死來掩護自己的懦弱，以死來避免艱苦的鬥爭，那自然是不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>所以我覺得卽管要死呢，也應當死在敵人之手，比如何是受着經濟壓迫的，你就去和壓迫你的决鬥，然而被敵人處你以死刑。比如你是失戀的，你就用强力去奪取那女者的心，肉體，不能的時候，你就殺掉他，再讓敵人殺掉你。至於爲着戰不過敵人，便自殺了之，這種人是應當承受各方面的唾棄的。</p>

<h3>窮則獨善其身</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>余束髮受書，立志彌堅，十載寒窗，未嘗俏懈。砥品礪行，期卓然有以自立；愛友惜名，欲他日馳騁當世。自中等學校卒業以來，服務桑梓，市經七載；忽困於病魔，繼綿牀褥，經六閱月之久，僅乃得生，而蹶然傷共一足。行步蹣跚，直類跛者：是不獨辜　　誠　求學之熱忱，抑且大背親師養育之至意；而轉念前途，建樹維艱，終日沈思，以求解脫此黑暗之深淵，乃百思而不得其法。適有友人韋君，示以今後之同路：謂「自古不得伸其志之徒，未能深切著明見之於行事，每退而論書策，以舒其憤，思垂空文以自見。若左丘失明，厥有國語：孫子臏足，兵法修列：子長受刑，史記彪炳千秋：子何不效法於斯，精研一藝，從事論述，不亦震耀當時，名垂後世乎？舍是弗圖，於此物競天擇，弱肉强食之世界，體魄健强者，猶難免失業恐慌，向隅之嘆；况子身體殘缺者，又烏覩其能自立耶？」當時葉君在旁，不待余至答，卽起而駁斥，曰「子何昧於時，盲於事若此哉？專精一藝，著書立說，在物質競爭較緩之古代，自屬可行；在生存競爭尖銳化之今日，似難辦到。吾人奔走衣食，日不暇給，焉有寛裕之金錢和時間，以應此高貴之要求哉？以吾觀之，身體殘廢者，誠不堪任事矣！顧劉君殘而不廢，仍能照常工作，觀於服務市南小學，行且二載，未嘗荒廢事業，卽可槪見。子不觀黨國偉人張靜江先生乎？張先生身體，爲反抗滿淸，以致殘缺，與劉君相較，其殘缺程度，殆過之而無不及：然而其功業燦然如日星。子不聞現任美國大總統羅斯福乎？羅氏前亦曾患腿病，久而復元，從事政治生涯，現爲美國復興之砥柱。故劉君雖攖斯疾，勿以是而欿然自視，喪失其懹抱，阻抑其志氣，發憤有爲，堅忍　　　必有　　之一日也。　葉君說畢，舉坐皆欣然稱是，余斯時已惘然失其所守，而莫衷一是。蓋兩者俱屬誇大之辭，陳義甚高，而未能切合余</p>

<p>之目前要求。余目前所亟欲知者，爲吾服務於世，究否能擔任具有重要意義之工作；其範圍初亦非祇限於了其個人及家庭生活之意義，含有個人主義一切享樂之企求；乃欲發揮意志，爲大衆犠牲奮鬥，改進國家社會，以不負國民之職責。凡此任務，年富力强具有現代思想者，當然可以徐逹其目的，以余身體殘缺者任之，究當發生若何之困難；抑因具有困難，而卽諉卸責任，以虚度此生。從此附於閒放者之列，以盡其天年，所謂窮則獨善其身耶？但余視此種自私自利之見解，實爲消極之個人主義，不啻打入養老宮殘廢院，余誓不欲犠牲歲月於無何有之鄕，而甘願放棄現代人民之義務也。凡吾向昔所欣慕之理想社會，及虔誠服膺之三民主義，余雅不欲在任何代價及環境之下，隨便抛棄，使余過去所費之腦汁心血和熱望，一起爲狂風骇浪所捲去。然余欲參加以上工作，並非毫無計劃，毫無把握，參證過去之經騐，及研究之心得，是有絕對實現之可能。僅以對於身體欠缺自信力，及懹疑客觀者對余之態度，究否如何？遂使余徘徊贍顧，却步不前，光陰虚擲，爲可惜也！茲爲補救已往之缺陷，及决定今後奮鬥之途俓，考察客觀者對余所持之態度起見，爲特函逹</p>
<p>端台，請爲詳細指導，俾作今後之南針，則感激無旣矣！肅此，敬頌</p>

<p>編者按：一個人不幸而身罹廢疾，全社會的大衆，應當出其共同生活之資料，以養之育之。何况他仍能力謀獨善其身呢？那裹還可以斥責他不盡責任呢？所以聖人許人以窮則獨善其身也。不過窮卽力不足之謂也；力不足者，中道而立也，非故步自封也。劉君的尊恙，看來尙不至於妨碍工作，所以仍當一秉初衷，向前奮鬥。寗可中道而廢，夫然後可告無愧。如其因小恙而裹足不前，是自盡也。人將不爾恕矣。至於立德立功立言，原屬殊途同歸之不朽事業，卽在身强體健者，尙須自視其天性環境之適宜與否，以定取舍，劉君擇一而行之可也。</p>

<h3>獄中記㈢</h3>
<p>— 車輸</p>
<p>今天我寫信給我妹妹和她的朋友說：</p>
<p>「戀愛不是肉與靈的滿足，但或者也都是的，唯最高的意義是滿意地雙方互助」！因爲他們大槪在談戀愛。</p>
<p>家裹拿來一些吃的東西是有限的，假使一個人吃，當然像多了，但地君和花君分去了些後，差不多全部完了，唯在菜乾頭裹的鷄，我爲自己留下了。今天星期，他們五個人都在號子裹，還有些零碎的蛋與肉也分掉了，光光剩下了鷄，當然我也盼望了很久很久才得到了這東西，並也不是多，假使在六個人瓜分下簡直就連最後的皮也完了。在獄裹誰都渴望着吃，去年春，拿來了我同花就大嚼｜那時我和他同室｜那時我倆都瀉着胃腸裹有病，却不管｜現今我當然不願意會全部給他們的。</p>
<p>起初我進來，難友們的貪食纔，使我討厭；有一個他腸胃剛好一些時我家裹送來了東西他是幾年的老病了，難得用種種方法治得好一些｜但他大嚼起來，比健康的人都呑得多，他的病又一天天的壤起來。他臨食肉時那滿口的唾液我常常想到了惡心。</p>
<p>我雖沒有吃，但他們更可憐，我當然不忍獨食，唯如给一個吃就其餘的也非給不可；所以關鷄我就一槪不給！</p>
<p>上午他們還吃到了些蛋和肉，下午假使我再給他們就要捱到鷄了；所以我剝了三個蛋，倒一些醬油，拈一些鷄裹的菜乾頭給他們，我正在弄的時候聽到｜「哼，弄鬼了！」「什麽弄鬼？」我還不明白的問老常，但他不答。</p>
<p>吃飯時人家都還吃一點，老常却不吃，我才曉得弄鬼所指的意義。</p>
<p>這裹無錢的犯人是如此對待有錢的政治犯的，他們對於政治犯的一切東西都想公開，因爲不公開人是這些人的行爲，大部分人是如此的，所以他們就以此希望於一般的政治犯｜因此我要吝嗇這鷄在他們是認爲不應該的，因他們對我的希望破了所以忿怒了。</p>
<p>四個人出去倒水和痰盂了，我和老韓留着｜「你接見拿來的東西，不要對我們客氣了！」老韓對我說。我那時在晒衣服，剛注意於窗外的晒衣鐵絲和動作着，的以沒有眯他，但心上翻了幾翻的難過了好一回。</p>

<h3>美國人所見的排猶後德國的電影事業</h3>
<h3>廣道</h3>
<p>德國自國社主義臌漲，一黨專政之後，該黨領袖希特勒於肅淸共黨之後，又掀起了一個排斥猶太藉人民的風潮。凡是猶太人，非但不能作政府的官吏，並且一切高尙職業，都不許猶太人加入。所以猶太人從前在德國作大學敎授，醫生，律師等等行業的，一律被解職而失業了。有許多因國内不能安居，不得不出亡國外，所以這般猶太人逃到法國，波蘭，俄國等等的，已不可勝計了。這般猶太人，本來是無國土的民族，這次被德國國社黨這樣排斥，還受種種凌辱，眞是悲苦得似喪家之犬。</p>
<p>德國的電影事業，也是國家文化事業的一種。自從全國的文化事業，都歸希特勒的迭克推多政府執管了，電影當然也就成了國家管理事業的一部份。所以德國的電影事業，當然也就不容猶太人插足於其間。不過猶太人在德國的電影事業中，也差不多像在美國一樣，是佔有極大的人數及財力的成份的。德國電影事業，自從在法西斯專政之下，將猶太人排除之後　　當然在人才方面，在經濟方面，都呈露了竭絀的現象，於是乎就不能不一方面由國家投資補助，一方面用高壓手段，將國外的德籍明星，技術人員等，召回本國了。</p>
<p>希特勒所標榜的理由，未嘗不振振有詞，說什麽重建祖國的文化等等，但是究其實際，與其說要重建，不如不加危害於文化事業。因爲猶太人是無國土的人民，在美國卽爲美人，在德國卽爲德人，一樣的對於國家効忠，對於社會盡力，不必加以歧視與排斥也。</p>
<p>據美國人的計算，德國自從將猶太人去掉之後，電影的事業，已經減縮掉了一半。有一位生在美國，而在德國長大的女士，呌芬安特拉（Fern　Andra）的，她說：「在德國，差不多一切的男女演員，他們在銀幕上有光榮的成就的，要不是屬於猶太血統的，亦至少有些猶太人的關係。現在他們將猶太人剷除了，電影事業之中還有什麽，我很難以推想了。製片家，導演，寫作家……他們都是猶太人。卽以美國而論，從德國來的一班有名人物，像萊摩耳（Laemmle）劉别謙（Lubitsch），佛郎特（Freund），布曼爾（Pommer），史登（Stern），杜榜德（Dupont），提泰勒（Dieterle），他們都是佼佼的猶太人。這些人都是於美國電影事業有大功勳的，但是德國竟不要他們回國去，因爲他們不是純粹亞利安人種的原故。」</p>
<p>芬安特垃因爲嫁過一個德國貴族，是一位男爵夫人。他從前在德國亦辦過一個攝影塲，不過現在關門了，因爲自從猶太人被驅逐之後，德國幾幾乎尋不到純粹亞利安族的德國導演，編劇等等人物贊她工作了。這樣就可以看到德國其他一切影片公司，在排猶風潮以後，所處境遇的困難了。</p>
<p>况且希特勒將一切猶太人排除之後，他能召集一班純粹德國人，去拍製完全的德國片子嗎？我們若將以往的事蹟查一查，就可以知道這件事的不易成功了。那般明星們，使德國影片蜚聲於世界的，都是純粹的德國人嗎？依密爾詹寗斯（Emil　Jannings）的父親是美國人，他自己是生在美國紐約東面勃羅格林的。波拉妮格莉（Ｐｏｌａ　Ｎｅｇｒｉ）是波蘭人。維爾麥朋開（Vilma　Banky）是匈牙利人。安娜史頓（Anna　Sten）是俄國人。稱爲「德國電影明星之母」的亞施塔耐爾遜（Aota　Neilsen）是丹麥人。尼爾斯愛斯泰（Nils　Asther）和葛雷泰嘉寳（Greta　Gar）bo）等係瑞典人。馮史登堡（Von　Sternberg）是美國生長的。麗琳哈蕙（Lilian　Harvey）是英國生長的。最後，就是希特勒本人，他都是奥國生的。他說的並不純粹的德國語言。他自己的國籍，還是在未做總理以前，送給他的呢！那還說什麽！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「英宮艶史」</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>Ｔｈｅ　Private　Life　of　Henry　VIII</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「英宮艶史」是叙述英王亨利第八的故事，他一生六易其后，烝其嫂氏，且通宮女，總之，是一個極淫亂的君王，故事是極簡單的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>攝宮庭影片，首先就要塲面的偉大，這是包括佈景表演而說的。因爲宮庭的建築和陳設，無疑的極堂皇富麗之至，宮人的行列而舉動，是頗具歌劇性的。這張「英宮艶史」，對於這點是一般的能够做到。</p>
<p>本來把形式弄得非常的莊嚴偉大，是能够影響觀衆的意識的。宗敎家，是最懂得這個道理。所以佛寺敎堂，總是建造得極高崇幽靜，卽使不信敎者，走到那裹，自然會「肅然起敬」的。王宮的極建造之美，自然更是把那一時代，那一階級的美極力的，顯示出來。</p>
<p>因爲背景的關係，導演者不得不多用力於背景的表現方面。但是最高明的導演者，是能够把背景與故事人物，緊緊的聯係起來。柏蒲斯德的多用長的移動鏡頭，就是在牢固背景與人物故事的關係，就是要把「空氣」的效果，擴大而加强起來。「英宮艶史」的對於背景的描寫，是相當的豐富了。不過空氣是空氣，人物是人物，中間互相帮助的地方，甚至於緊緊的聯係的地方，也很少的。</p>
<p>本來要個人主義的作家，放棄了單獨，或則少數人主角的方法，而去描寫一個集團，甚至一羣都是不可能的。那末，「英宮艶史」的以亨利第八爲主體，次第的把和他有關係的人物引出來，製作者自然想不到人物和背景中的關聯了。</p>
<p>男主角是很盡職的表演，其它就差得遠了。好在他的戲，是佔全部的大多數的！</p>
<p>本來，寫到這裹，已經够了。但是「宮庭片」的意義，是應該說一說的。因爲過去批評者，對於「宮庭片」的分析還很少。</p>
<p>一般的說來，君主政治，是封建社會的特徴。雖則目前，還有君制存在。但他們已經完全喪失了封建社會的權力了。像英國，像日本他們的君王的權力，是不及一個閣揆的。所以封建時代的君王們，所任意做的事情，目前的君主們，都不會再做了。特别是個人主義的現社會的一夫一妻制的建立，卽使君王，也不能，公開的任意荒淫了。於是從前君王的風流韻事，就變成了人們話談中的資料，幷且被映在當作游藝品的電影上。「英宮艶史」就是這樣的一張影片。</p>
<p>老實說，在過去的宮庭荒淫的故事，是隨處都有的。卽以我們中國而論，歷史上宮庭的淫亂荒謬，較之亨利第八，恐怕有十倍百倍的厲害，不過當時的史册上，不能記載罷了。我們只看到野史雜記中，已經看到不少了。所以像「英宮艶史」的故事，我們是不會懹疑製作者誇張的。</p>
<p>當然，美國的製作者，所以拿亨利第八的故事來攝製電影，一方面原是我上面所說的爲了「趣味」，而主要的，却是目前社會是和封建社會鬥爭，而獲勝的資本社會，描寫出封建社會的統治者的荒謬，客觀上是證明了封建社會的沒落。資本社會的代興是必然而且合理的事。幷且美國一開始，就拿華盛頓的「民主」政治出現的。那末，他們的描寫英國過去的亨利第八，自然等於「野叟暴言」而細說鄰居的興衰一樣，都是消遣而已。</p>
<h3>評「邊海情潮」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>對於小公司因其資本薄弱而原諒作品的技巧是可以的，但至少要影片本身多少有一點兒意義。</p>
<p>「邊海情潮」的作者，在字幕上堂皇其詞的說，中國靑年，應當殖邊墾荒，爲國爲民謀福利……這種好招牌，似乎很可以號召一下，因爲這是很時髦的。其實，所謂墾邊殖荒者，不過是一種自欺欺人的口號而已。譬如說已經墾殖了的邊疆，已經給列强侵略了去，假使列强的侵略，並不因我們的反抗而消滅，那末是否再墾殖起來而等待列强宰割呢？所謂失了東北而鼓吹墾殖西北的論調，簡直敎人尋死路。至於態度上的消極，尙在其次。</p>
<p>不，「邊海情潮」的作者，說是要在野蠻之鄕的海邊上開闢商埠，這在中國有無這種地方，姑且不論，而有了這種地方居然可以等着那幾位不三不四的靑年去開闢，眞是莫明其妙。　　但是，再說罷，作者是否就將這一招牌當做主題呢？這眞是天曉得，就在那個海邊上來一個極不通的戀愛把戲。</p>
<p>其次，作者在字幕上寫得很體面的，反對野蠻人將情人處以死地，似乎是咀咒封建勢力的，但是結果却是擁護殘酷的火燒人，而女主角亦良心發現的因失戀去跳海。</p>
<p>此外，沒有字幕就沟有劇情。字幕幾乎佔了影片的一半。幾塲找武，可惡之極。人扮的猩猩，簡直是下流無聊。</p>
<p>男女間的關係，不通之極，至於「巧合」之多，更不必說。</p>
<p>據說所谓導演原來是攝影師，由於他的經騐，應當稍稍通順。可是連接剪都不懂得，遠景之後接一個近景，因爲遠景的不剪掉，於是同一個動作便重複了兩次。至於Ｈａｒｖｅｙ的瞎用，更是可笑，如開商埠照相者，淡入，一架照像機旁站三個人，加上一條字幕，說要照相以留紀念，立刻淡出，於是一幕完結。這是多麽幼稚可笑，甚至於比生機的Ｆａｄｅ還不如　　其他，也用不着再說了。</p>
<h3>萬人翹首瞻皇后</h3>
<p>有一天很早，孫瑜便率領了攝製「體育皇后」的全體人員，由聯華二廠出發到南市舟山輪碼頭拍外景。攝影機纔放下便圍攏了許多人，連交通也幾乎斷絕，有一個鏡頭是頑皮的林纓獨自一人爬到輪船的烟囱上去，當黎莉莉爬了上去之後，於是很遠很遠的路上行人都駐足而望。他們因爲平日只見煤烟滿臉衣服齷齪的火夫是在上面刷油或是刮銹，現在忽然換上一個苗條健美的女子當然要覺得詫異，後來知道是聯華公司拍影戲，而且是「體育皇后」黎莉莉，便蠭撰前來，碼頭上，輪船上，擠得踵背相接，弄到要趁船的客人，幾乎有路不通行之槪</p>
<h3>代柬</h3>
<p>答西文君：</p>
<p>大作「獻給電影專刋的幾句廢話」一文，未便發表。你所提出的竟見，謹簡單答覆如次。電影批評和文藝批評一樣，少不了是就最新的作品加以批判。不錯，有許多讀者不一定都看第一輪外國影音，因此對於不知貴族化的電影院中的人們，確是不大方便。不過如留心電影批評的人，在腦筋中有了一個印象，等到第二三輪開映的時候，亦有多少帮助。或者他們還可以將當日報上所看到的評，保留着以待日後喪按，要是他們認爲有價値的話。此外你所說的批評者和編輯者「沒有愛國心」不批評中國影片，却與事實不符。本刋對於中國影片盡力提倡，乃是最顯著的事實證明。第一個新的國片開映，本刋卽以最顯著之地位，刋載批評文字。謹此具覆，尙祈鑒原！　　　編者</p>
<p>答史繼　君：</p>
<p>（一）關於電影理論書籍，中文本有申報出版之「電影藝術論」和晨報出版之「電影導演論與脚本論」，可供參考。英文版本書目繁多，不及備載。</p>
<p>（二）Montage一字，頗難翻譯，因其有畫面構成與畫面編輯的意義，此外如「Fade　in」「Fade　out」譯爲「淡入」「淡入」，「Dissolve」譯爲一化「，「C.U」爲特寫，「M.C」爲中景「……等等，以至於「Cut」爲一個鏡頭之終止，恕不能一一寫出。上述諸書，俱有列入，讀過之後，不難明瞭。此覆。　　　　編者</p>

<h3>同仇㈣</h3>
<p>— 慧蘭</p>
<p>火車將要開行了，月臺上的小芬志超，依依的惜别，鎭安和許多人也來相送，綠旗揮動了，小芬緊握着志超的手，然而志超終於是上車了，小芬目送着車窗移動，在頭等車中，竟會坐着一個張曼琳，車走到小芬的面前的時候，曼琳悠然的將窗幃拉下，小芬開始明白了一切，痛苦悲憤，簡直要迷失了歸路。</p>
<p>在車廂裹，志超跟曼琳坐在一處，這時候的候的志超，多少有一些自責的表現，　　寡歡，曼琳是不時的在逗引着他。</p>
<p>火車開行時，震動得很厲害。曼琳倚靠在志超的懹裹，他當然不能拒絕，她那熱辣辣的眼睛，注視着他，久久的不瞬，後來目光轉烈桌上的烟罐，志超懶洋洋，取出一枝香烟，遞給曼琳，又替她點火，曼琳的臉上，浮起勝利的微笑。</p>
<p>「濟南李團長志超鑒，今午安產　男，　回一視，並需欵，芬養。」滿面怒容的曼琳，揘着這電報在出神，又看看桌上的志超的戎裝照片，决然的翻轉電報纸，立時的擬回電：「旭街三十四號殷小芬，生產與我何干，今後勿再相擾，超　。」</p>
<p>她自己和了手提包，大槪是出去發電報。</p>
<p>悲傷而又寂寞的小芬，久候志超回電不到，焦急萬分，門突然開了，僕婦欣然的送這電報來，小芬破涕爲笑的來看電報。小芬的面色慘變了，手抖顫着，突然的哭不可抑。僕婦倒弄得莫明其妙，趕忙的趨前問故，偶一不小心，撞倒几上的花盆，那將殘的菊花，花瓣立時一片片地的落下。小芬被棄以後，祇得遷到破小的屋子了。</p>
<p>「平津危急」的號外報纸，騒然的在街頭上呌賣着，小芬聽到這聲音，丢開舊摇籃的嬰兒，推開窗子向外望。</p>
<p>一羣學生，正在對民衆演說：</p>
<p>「敵人快來到天津了，我們的家鄕在被燒刦，我們的父母妻子在被屠殺，我們還能不救麽？……」</p>
<p>羣衆們聽了，非常的激昂，小芬聽到家鄕和父親，不由的悚然起來，想起了當日慈父勸她不要太相信志超的訓言，傷心而流淚，稍停了一會，决然的立起身來，收拾行李，作回鄕的凖備。</p>
<p>曼琳跟志超對立着，彼此的情感，都很緊張似的，志超像已决定了主意，曼琳怒視着他，但不一會，她又小貓一般的柔媚的投到志超的懹裹，撫摸着他的面龐。</p>
<p>「親愛的，你不能去！打戰不是好玩的事，你去了呌我怎辦？」</p>
<p>志超的臉，儘管被他撫摸，但他神色不變，曼琳又運用她全身的媚力，吻，不斷的吻着他，然而他終於理智戰勝了感情，兩手推開懹中的曼琳，嚴肅而又悲痛地：</p>
<p>「曼琳！你可以使我做一個背叛妻子的丈夫，但你不能使我做一個背叛大衆的民賊！」　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）</p>

<h3>Liu Guitang's Troops Scattered</h3>
<p>One Part Fled to Dezhou Along the Cangshi Road</p>
<p>Another Part Rummaged Around Gu'an and Xiongxian</p>
<p>Rumors that Renqiu County Seat Has Been Besieged</p>
<p>(Beiping) The bandit Liu's troops have been broken up and scattered in different directions. Hundreds of Liu's bandits have recently been discovered outside Dawuyu and Changweikou between Pingbei Miyun and Huairou. The security team is closely guarding against them. Those who crossed Pingnan to flee included one part that fled to Dezhou along the Cangshi Road, and another part that fled south to Gu'an and near Xiongxian. In groups of two or three hundred, they are attacking the earthen walls of various villages south of Gu'an. The villagers are resisting. Liu's troops have many camels, each carrying two baskets containing women. Apart from the families of the bandit troops, all were women kidnapped from the villages they passed through. When the bandit Liu's troops crossed Pingbei, Shibata of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping received a telegram from Nishi Yoshiichi, commander of the Japanese 8th Division, from Rehe, saying that he had issued a mobilization order and would depart immediately. After the bandit Liu's troops fled south, Shibata sent a reply telegram. Yesterday, Shibata received another telegram from Nishi Yoshiichi, saying that since the bandit Liu's troops were far away from the war zone, the Japanese army did not need to mobilize. Shibata has notified Zhu Shiqin of this situation and relayed it to He Yingqin. (Sixth Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that Liu Guitang led more than 2,000 bandits and arrived on the north bank of the Hutuo River yesterday. They were severely beaten by the militia. That night, the bandit Liu crossed the river at the Gaoqiao ferry. Wang Yizhe's troops, who were pursuing him, also arrived at Niutuo Town. After crossing the river, the bandit Liu gathered and looted several miles from Renqiu County, attempting to capture Renqiu County. Therefore, the bandit Liu occupied the vicinity of the county seat. According to the report received this morning, there were rumors that the city had been besieged. In the afternoon, the provincial government called again, saying that the advance team of Liu's bandit cavalry had suddenly moved to Hejian.

<h3>Excess of Imports and Economic Self-Sufficiency Shen</h3>
<p>||The Trend of Economic Alliances||</p>
<p>In the past ten months of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the total value of China's foreign trade exports was 500.7 million yuan, and the total value of imports was 115.8 million yuan. The excess of imports in these ten months has exceeded 650.1 million yuan. In the autumn of national hardship, poverty, and financial exhaustion, the expression of foreign tangible trade is already like this, indicating the predicament of the national economic life of our country and the difficulty of restoring prosperity within this year. If we further examine the actual situation of China's economic structure and its relationship with the international economy, we will also know that since China's interactions with the great powers, it has always been a raw material exporting country. Because China has not yet broken away from the form of an agricultural country, the types of exported goods are always agricultural products or agricultural by-products, with manufactured goods in a lower position. Last year, this situation changed, and manufactured goods jumped to the first place, accounting for more than 40% of the export volume. At first glance, it seems to be an advancement in China's economic organization, or at least a symbol of the industrial development of China's major cities. However, the trend of events is exactly the opposite. The reasons for the change in tangible trade last year are: first, because the four northeastern provinces were ceded, the import of soybeans and other agricultural products and mineral raw materials is no longer seen in China's foreign export trade records. The semi-finished products and manufactured goods of cities with relatively convenient transportation have surpassed agricultural products and raw materials to take first place. Second, the economy of the inland rural areas is heading towards collapse. Although food prices are at an all-time low, it is not because the quantity has increased or there is a surplus of food, but only because of the impact of foreign food, the market is piled up and difficult to sell. Third, the world economic crisis has not yet truly improved, and the absorption of raw materials is extremely sluggish. Other consumer goods are even more out of the question. Therefore, China's major products, such as raw silk and tea, have suffered great difficulties. This is why there has been an unprecedented change in trade.</p>
<p>The balance of international payments does not necessarily rely entirely on tangible trade imports and exports as an indication of a country's economic prosperity or decline. England is a powerful country. Before and after the World War, it held the reins of world finance and was the leader of industrial countries. Although it has shown signs of aging recently, it is still a great power. Its tangible trade has an excess of imports every year, but it still does not detract from its wealth. India is a poor country, but its tangible trade has a trade surplus every year. Not only has this not increased its wealth, but it is becoming poorer day by day. This is because one has intangible imports, that is, income from interest on foreign investment and income from ships for contribution. The other is exploited by others, that is, payments of interest on foreign investment exceed the trade surplus. Therefore, England can still barely survive in the world economic crisis, while India is becoming more and more impoverished. China has had huge import surpluses for many years, and the reason why it can still support the international economic balance is not because it has interest on foreign investment, nor does it have income from ships to make up for it, but only relies on the money remitted home by overseas Chinese, which is estimated to be about 200 million yuan per year. The second is the secret export of gold and silver, which is also a significant amount. However, the economic situation of overseas Chinese is gradually deteriorating, and the remittances will inevitably decrease. The secret export of gold and silver will also gradually decrease due to traffic obstruction. Therefore, China's excess of imports in foreign trade has revealed an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual lessons learned by the great powers since the World War, and in view of the current situation of economic warfare, market competition, and the arms race, they are making every effort to concretize economic alliances. England has already started, and in the past year, it has gradually laid a foundation. The United States first seeks domestic stability and then extends it to South America. Japan, with its small island, has vigorously advocated its so-called "Japan-Manchuria" economic alliance since annexing Manchuria. Our country is surrounded by strong neighbors and has rare resources in the world. If it can be proactive in a timely manner, the formation of a self-sufficient economy should not be inferior to any advanced country in the world. If it continues like this and cannot develop and support itself, how can it avoid becoming a victim of economic struggles? Can we not be alarmed when we read the figure of over 600 million yuan in excess imports?</p>
<h3>Simon Returns to London, States</h3>
<p>Paris and Rome Talks Beneficial to European Agreement</p>
<p>Geneva Expresses Satisfaction with British Foreign Secretary's Declaration</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in London today from Rome and told reporters that his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Flandin would help facilitate a European agreement. It is understood that Simon's talks with the Italian Prime Minister were largely explanatory. Judging from the statements released after the talks, Italy does not insist that reorganizing the League of Nations is the most important issue in current international politics. Italy may continue to actively participate in Geneva conferences, and it is undoubtedly the case that both the Italian Prime Minister and the British Foreign Secretary believe that disarmament is the most urgent issue above all others today. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Before departing from Rome to return to England, British Foreign Secretary Simon issued a declaration summarizing his repeated meetings with Mussolini. League of Nations figures expressed satisfaction with Simon's declaration, saying that the League of Nations can at least remain safe for a certain period without being destroyed as some have recently suggested. However, the length of this period is yet to be determined. Reorganizing the League of Nations is inherently a very difficult issue. If, as Simon said, practical discussions will be postponed until the disarmament issue is resolved, then countries will have time to carefully consider this matter. Simon also said that Britain believes that the reorganization of the League of Nations must be carried out in accordance with the procedures established in the League of Nations Covenant, and only if the reorganization benefits the League of Nations should it proceed. Some people believe that, based on Simon's remarks, the French perspective on the reorganization of the League of Nations during the Rome talks, which is also the perspective of the League of Nations Secretariat, ultimately prevailed. As for the disarmament issue, the news from Rome is not very accurate, and it is difficult to comment on the talks between Mussolini and Simon on this matter. However, most people believe that Simon's discussions with the Italian Prime Minister on disarmament were merely an exchange of information. Practical negotiations will not begin until the League of Nations Council meets on January 15. Geneva figures are certain that British Foreign Secretary Simon will attend the League of Nations Council in mid-month. By then, the British government will have gathered various pieces of information, making it easier to judge the recent prospects of the Disarmament Conference. It is also generally expected that Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, Vice-Chairman Politis, and General Rapporteur Béla Kun will all come to Geneva in mid-month. Whether the Disarmament Conference Bureau and the General Committee should convene as planned on January 22, or postpone the meeting to early February, will be decided after consultations by all parties at that time. Governments must also contact each other so that they can take concerted action when the Disarmament Conference reconvenes. This contact will require at least three weeks.

<p>Britain and Italy Do Not Support French Proposal</p>
<p>Leaving Germany Room to Return to the League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph wrote an article stating that Britain and Italy do not support France's request for a disarmament trial period because Simon stated in Rome that Germany does indeed have the right to equal treatment, both spiritually and materially. However, according to the Exchange Telegraph, British political circles view the answers given in the French memorandum as the most promising steps since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. It also states that as a result of the French memorandum and the Rome talks, the British government may take more active steps toward mediation in the near future. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>World War Machine</h3>
<p>Conflict Between US and Russia and Japan Inevitable</p>
<p>Lethal Competition in Europe as Well</p>
<p>|Italy's Dangerous Words|</p>
<p>In his report on the review of the naval budget, Italian Congressman Fanseller predicted that there would be lethal competition within Europe, and that Japan and the United States would have a fierce conflict for hegemony in the Pacific. Fanseller discussed the diplomatic and political situation in recent months, saying that the fiercest and most direct struggle at present appears to be between Japan and the United States, with the aim of dominating the Pacific. Europe, however, is unable to pay attention to the most serious danger to the future of the world due to the deadly infighting within. The current chaotic situation is a prelude to the serious development between Japan and the United States, the starting point of which is the Japanese government's occupation of Manchuria and the adoption of a kind of Monroe Doctrine, which endangers American interests in China and the security of the Philippines and Guam. However, Japan itself is also going through an extremely dangerous period, deeply concerned about the progress of the situation in northeastern Asia, which will be unfavorable to it. Therefore, it is intensifying its economic and military aggression in the area. In addition, the Soviet Union's concentration of air force bases is close to the Japanese coast. In order to consolidate the puppet organization of Manchuria and ensure the fulfillment of its responsibility for administering the Pacific trust islands, Japan has no choice but to greatly expand its naval, land, and air forces.

<h3>Hirota Coordinates Diplomacy</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota is preparing to welcome British Lord Privy Seal Lord Hailsham to Japan as a friendly envoy as part of preparations for peaceful diplomacy. In addition, as a sign of friendship between Japan and the United States, both Otoshiko Matsukata and religious leader Hiromichi Ozaki will travel to the US. Therefore, at this time, he hopes that an American envoy will come to Japan. Thus, Foreign Minister Hirota expects: (1) to gain understanding of Japan's policy of prioritizing peace in the Far East; (2) to have the British and American countries abandon abstract arguments and understand the reality of "Manchukuo"; 1. "Manchukuo" has become a fait accompli and should be recognized immediately. Although formal recognition is not limited in time, there is a practical persuasion to recognize it. Since the "Manchukuo" issue may arise as a side issue at the 1935 naval conference, it will be resolved separately in advance, and at the same time, the attitude of the countries in 1935 will be known in advance.

<h3>Araki's Illness Eases Japanese Political Situation</h3>

<p>Head-On Conflict with the Military Temporarily Avoided</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The condition of Army Minister Araki was watched by political circles and all parties before the closing of parliament. According to what Vice-Minister of the Army Yanagawa said on the afternoon of the 6th, the Army Minister's condition is pneumonia, but he is progressing well. His heart is strong and no other symptoms have occurred. According to the doctor, if he can continue to progress smoothly, he will need to rest for more than a month, and will be able to serve by the beginning of February at the latest. During the period when the Army Minister is ill, no consideration has been given to the matter of establishing a temporary representative. At 9:00 a.m. on the 6th, the Army Minister's temperature was 38.6 degrees, and his appetite was unchanged, but he has not yet escaped the alert. (Rengo, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 65th session of the Japanese Diet is scheduled to reconvene on the 23rd. The main issues of this session are: (1) rural countermeasures; (2) the problem of the opposition between the Minister of Justice and the Minister of the Army in a certain major incident; (3) the issue of military discipline; (4) financial issues, mainly military spending. Because Army Minister Araki is seriously ill, the internal strife within the government seems to be easing. According to observations in political circles, the 65th session of the Diet can be expected to pass peacefully for the following reasons: (1) The cooperation between the Seiyukai and the Minseito has not yet been effectively linked, and they cannot attack the government unanimously in the Diet. (2) The changes in the political situation have not been prepared by the military and financial cliques, and neither is confident of taking over the next government. (3) The government's performance since its formation has been good. (4) Finance Minister Takahashi's financial policy has won the trust of both domestic and foreign parties. (5) Due to Army Minister Araki's illness, it is inconvenient to protest the struggle between the judiciary and the military police and the issue of military discipline in the Diet, which can reduce the head-on conflict with the army.

<h3>Contents of the India-Japan Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Releases Minutes</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the minutes of the plenary meeting of the Japan-India consultations on the 5th in both Japanese and English as follows:</p>
<p>Representative Sawada said that he was most pleased that the opinions of the representatives of Japan and India were consistent on the following matters: (1) "Most Favored Nation Treatment" Regarding Tariffs: Japan and India mutually allow most-favored-nation treatment with regard to tariffs. (2) "Negotiations on Changes to Tariffs": For the sake of protecting their own interests, Japan and India reserve the right to change tariffs as necessary. If one party changes tariffs and affects the interests of the other party, negotiations will begin between the two countries at the request of one party. (3) "Measures to Correct the Impact of Changes in Exchange Rates": Although the Indian government can change tariffs and correct changes in exchange rates, if it levies special tariff rates or changes them, the Indian government must consider in advance the relationship between Japan's purchase of raw materials from India and the increase in the export price of Japanese goods, and it must be agreed that this tariff rate is limited to correcting the impact on prices. (4) "Tariffs on Japanese Cotton Cloth Imported into India": The Indian government's tariffs on Japanese cotton cloth must not exceed the following rates: 50% ad valorem or 5.25 annas per pound for plain woven, unfinished cloth, and 50% ad valorem for other cotton cloth. (5) "Japanese Cotton Cloth Imported into India" (A) The calculation of the ratio quantity of Japanese cotton cloth imported into India in the year beginning on April 1 is based on the quantity of Indian cotton exported to Japan in the year from January 1 of the same year and is limited to the ratio quantity. (B) Baseline Allocation and Changes to Baseline Allocation: The baseline ratio of Japanese cotton cloth exported to India in a cotton cloth year is 425 million yards and is correlated with 1 million bales of Indian cotton exported to Japan in a cotton year. (C) The cotton cloth year is divided into two halves. The allocation for the first half of the year is 200 million yards, and the allocation for the second half of the year is equivalent to this. The quantity obtained by subtracting 200 million yards from the annual allocation calculated based on the expected quantity of Indian cotton exported to Japan in the cotton year is a provisional decision. (D) Cotton cloth allocation variety distinction, divided into 45% for plain weave unfinished, 13% for printed unfinished, 8% for bleached, and 34% for colored goods and others. (6) "Implementation of the New Agreement" (A) The separation of India and Burma. (B) Effective Period of the New Treaty: Japan and India must sign the treaty early in London, and it will be implemented immediately after the exchange of instruments of ratification and will be effective until the end of March 1937. Governor Bhaya told Representative Sawada that the Indian representative fully agreed with Your Excellency's statement. Representative Sawada stated that the Japan Textile Federation had decided to withdraw its resolution not to buy Indian cotton from January 8. Governor Bhaya further stated that from the day Japan withdraws its resolution not to buy Indian cotton, it will allow a reduction in the tariff on Japanese cotton cloth and most-favored-nation treatment.

<h3>Hirota Expresses Gratification and Urges Japanese Businessmen to Consider the Big Picture</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the contents of the eight-point Japan-India consultation agreement at 10 pm yesterday. This morning, Foreign Minister Hirota issued a statement saying, "Japan and Britain were once allied countries, and their feelings were close. After the Washington Conference, the alliance was abolished and replaced by the Four-Power Treaty. Recently, Britain and its territories have adopted a policy of boycotting Japanese goods and raising tariffs. The Indian government suddenly raised tariffs in August last year and cancelled the commercial treaty, which caused Japanese feelings toward Britain and India to gradually deteriorate. If this is allowed to continue without trying to remedy it, an unfortunate incident will occur in the future of the two countries. Fortunately, both parties agreed to start consultations since September 25 last year. Although there were twists and turns during the sixteen meetings, it was finally resolved satisfactorily on the 5th of this month, which is truly gratifying for the future of the two countries. Japanese businessmen may still have dissatisfaction, but if they can consider the big picture, they will have to endure it. The development of Japanese industry in recent years has led to boycotts from various countries, but the government, based on the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity in the world, has decided to sign similar agreements with various countries to remedy this crisis, and hopes that Japanese businessmen will consider this point."

<h3>Japanese Army Stationed in Manchuria to Return to Peacetime Status from April</h3>
<p>Implemented Separately According to Regional Tasks</p>
<p>Three Divisions Reorganized into Elite Units</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Central Department and the Kwantung Army Headquarters will conduct a study on the restoration of the wartime status of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Manchuria to peacetime status. It is generally believed that it should be restored as soon as possible, but the restoration of peacetime status, such as the construction of barracks and official residences, requires a large amount of money. On the other hand, since it is still necessary to suppress bandits, full restoration is actually difficult, and technical research on this point has been carried out. As a result, the wartime allowance may be restored to the peacetime allowance first, and it will be implemented separately according to regional tasks. The period is roughly determined to be April 1. The wartime allowance is about twice the peacetime allowance, reaching 7-8 million yuan. After that, the construction of barracks and official residences will begin. The minimum cost of building a barracks for one regiment is 1.2-1.3 million yuan with local labor and materials. Therefore, the Japanese army budget for the next year will increase somewhat in this regard. (World Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of the Army will make slight modifications to the domestic organization due to the permanent stationing of troops in the four northeastern provinces. The main units, the 7th Division from Asahikawa, the 3rd Division from Nagoya, and the 16th Division from Kyoto, will be mobilized. The replenishment and reorganization of these three divisions will be carried out from April to June. (Hualian, 7th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Tours the Country</h3>

Since the New Year, Matsuoka's residence has been piled high with New Year's greetings and letters of support for Matsuoka's proposals from young people across the country whom he does not know. Among them, there are even New Year's cards with "Devotion to the Nation" written in blood by more than a dozen young people. Therefore, Matsuoka could not help but feel emotional and said that a dull disciple of the world will travel the country on foot. My opponent is the young people, so the soul and the soul are combined. I intend to use the pure spirit of the young people as a foundation. If Japan is willing to transform Japan within the next five years and can skillfully navigate international relations and enrich the country, then it will be able to see the light of day again.

<h3>Leader of South Irish Blueshirts Attacks Government in Speech</h3>
<p>Points to Economic War with England as a Child's Play</p>
<p>Irreconcilable with the Minister of Agriculture</p>
<p>Dublin, General O'Duffy, leader of the South Irish United Party, wearing a blue shirt and leading a cavalry escort, entered Wexford city today and delivered a speech attacking the government in an open-air meeting, saying that if the government continues to play its farce, it will have to send one-third of the Irish people to prison, one-third to insane asylums, and one-third to poorhouses, and said that the Minister of Agriculture should resign now and compete with him for election in the Wexford district. If he cannot defeat the Minister of Agriculture by a ratio of six to one, then he will never appear in this district again. General O'Duffy also pointed to the economic war with England as a child's play. When the meeting was held, troops gathered to prevent riots, but the order was quite good. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Resigns</h3>
<p>Due to Congressional Criticism in Bribery Case</p>
<p>Morgenthau Loses a Right-Hand Man</p>
<p>(Washington) US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Perry resigned today due to congressional criticism. The selection of a successor has not yet been announced, but Perry's position as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury was only temporary, so his departure is not surprising in political and banking circles. Perry is related to the Schrader Company, which previously lent a large loan to Peru and bribed the son of the Peruvian president with 450,000 yuan. After the Senate's investigation of the securities market committee discovered this, the price of the bond fell sharply, and this bribe was mostly from the public's pockets. Senator Coulson then demanded Perry's resignation. Perry's letter of resignation stated that after the recent death of Schrader of the Schrader Company, he could not devote himself to the company's business, so he requested to resign as Secretary of the Treasury immediately. Morgenthau immediately replied and agreed, using very gentle wording and not mentioning the company's affairs, because Perry was Morgenthau's right-hand man. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Bond Embezzlement Scandal Shrouds the French Political Scene</h3>
<p>Xu Dan Issues a Notice to Exonerate the Colonial Minister</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Claims to Have Never Met the Main Culprit</p>
<p>Radical Assemblymen Discover They Participated in a Conspiracy</p>
<p>Newspapers Change Their Tone from Ridiculing the Authorities</p>
<p>Countless Bankruptcies Among the People Incite Public Outrage</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the unprecedented major embezzlement case occurred in the Bayonne region, involving important government officials, the French political scene has been shrouded in an atmosphere of gloom. However, Prime Minister Xu Dan seems determined to break through this gloom and move forward. Today, Mr. Xu held a second lengthy discussion with the Colonial Minister, Da Li Mi, who is implicated in this case. Afterwards, Xu Dan immediately issued a notice to exonerate Da Li Mi of all charges.</p>
<p>Xu Dan's notice stated that Da Li Mi's letters issued during his tenure as Minister of Labor, endorsing the promotion of Bayonne local government bonds, are sufficient to prove Da Li Mi's innocence. This is because the letters were actually drafted by lower-level officials, and Da Li Mi merely signed them. Furthermore, the current Finance Minister, Pang Lai, has also been subjected to much external gossip. Today, he issued a declaration stating that he has never met the main culprit in this major embezzlement case, Shi Da Wei Si Ji, and that he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the fact that his Finance Ministry colleagues, Gui Bao Li Bao, had served as legal advisors to Shi. At the same time, the newspapers, which had previously used black ink to describe the alleged involvement of government authorities in this embezzlement case, have now visibly changed their tune, gradually using red, white, and blue ink. It is said that the current Minister of the Army and former Prime Minister Da La Di Er had been invited to breakfast by Shi Da Wei Si Ji, but the two men responded with a public document paper from the ministry bearing the words "I will not dine with merchants." Therefore, today's newspapers are spreading this incident as a good story, and the reputations of the two men are greatly enhanced. New discoveries are made in this case every day, and radical assemblymen Jia La and Pang Nao may soon face imprisonment, as it has been alleged by those who have been arrested that Jia La was aware of the matter, and that Pang Nao, who served as Shi Da Wei Si Ji's legal advisor, also participated in the conspiracy. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that when French Prime Minister Xu Dan discussed the improper issuance of municipal public bonds in Bayonne with Colonial Minister Da Li Mi today, he said that either the minister resigns, or the entire cabinet will resign together. This Bayonne public bond affair is said to be the most shocking political and financial case in half a century since the Panama scandal. It is reported that the funds involved in this case amount to 6 million pounds. The French press has unanimously mobilized to criticize the matter. The Times, which has always maintained a serious attitude, also published an article today questioning whether this case contains elements of corruption, while the Daily Debate believes that the case is a harbinger of collapse. Parliament will openly discuss the matter on Tuesday, at which time the government will answer all questions. At the same time, the government has agreed to thoroughly investigate the case. Currently, the only person arrested in connection with the case is Di Xi Er, the head of the Bayonne Municipal Public Bond Bank (pawn brokerage). Mr. Di is now requesting the arrest of the Mayor of Bayonne. As for the banker Shi Da Wei Si Ji, who was born in Russia and is involved in the case, although police in several countries have made efforts to search for him, he remains untraceable. It is reported that in addition to Da Li Mi, Shi Da Wei Si Ji also warmly welcomed other cabinet members and parliamentarians, so they are also in danger of being implicated. Shi's wife and children still reside in Paris. When the police searched their residence today, they found 60,000 francs. Shi's wife claimed that this money was her personal property. It is said that Shi is a famous adventurer, who is found in banks, racecourses, nightclubs, concert halls, and newspapers. Due to the widespread issuance of Bayonne municipal public bonds, several small investors have declared bankruptcy. Since the announcement of the Bayonne bank embezzlement case, it has aroused public outrage. Therefore, when Mr. Di was arrested, the public was eager to take justice into their own hands. It is said that according to the law, the city of Bayonne can only issue public bonds below 1 million pounds. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Detectives Search Everywhere for the Main Culprit (Paris) The wife of the big swindler Shi Da Wei Si Ji, who was staying in a first-class hotel, escaped and disappeared today with her children. The person in charge of the hotel said that he never expected that this fashionable woman, who claimed to be Mrs. Xi Men, was the wife of the big swindler. Although the police station is searching everywhere for Mr. Shi, there is still no trace. According to news from the London news agency, a passenger on the Alfila ship threw himself into the sea near the African coast, apparently Mr. Shi. However, many are suspicious of this. It is still rumored that Colonial Minister Da Li Mi must eventually resign. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>American Congressmen's Plan to Reuse Silver</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted to Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) American Congressman Shi Di Gai Er announced today that he will submit a bill to Congress to reuse silver as currency, with a total purchase value of 100 million yuan. The plan proposes that the Treasury Department purchase all silver produced domestically and issue silver certificates monthly. Senators Hui Le and Congressmen Shi Ke Lu Han had previously each proposed a bill regarding the reuse of silver as currency, but neither included silver purchase regulations. Mr. Shi's bill will be the third. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Budget Bill Expected to Have Heated Debate</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Robinson, the Democratic leader in the Senate, announced that the Senate will convene on Monday or Tuesday next week to discuss the liquor tax bill, which is expected to pass without difficulty and can be completed in about a week. The House will also convene next week to discuss the budget bill, which is unlikely to be completed in a short period of time. It is anticipated that there will be much debate in both the Senate and the House. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Republicans have begun to attack the budget bill proposed by President Roosevelt. Senator Patterson, a Republican senator, said that the budget deficit is as high as 70 million yuan, which shows that American finances are about to go bankrupt. He also said that Congress has been monopolized by Roosevelt's power, and the only way to stop the government's waste is to rely on public opinion. Democratic leaders said that the increase in expenditure is due to extremely urgent uses, and that the ordinary budget is not far from being balanced. By 1936, both ordinary and extraordinary budgets can be maintained in equilibrium. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Former Romanian Foreign Minister Refuses to Cooperate with the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Former Romanian Foreign Minister Di Du Lou Si Ge met with the new Prime Minister Da Da Lai Si Ge to discuss joining the new cabinet. Afterwards, he issued a communique with ambiguous wording. Mr. Di has not explicitly stated whether he has agreed to join. However, those in charge expect that Mr. Di will still refuse to cooperate with the new cabinet. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Well-informed sources in Romania claim that the former Foreign Minister is unwilling to cooperate with the new government for the following reasons: The Romanian police's attitude towards the members of the Pan-National Party is too lenient, and they even show sympathy for the party. Mr. Di wants to reorganize the detective team in order to implement a strict policy and punish extreme right-wing figures. However, some senior police officers are allied with the right and left, and Mr. Di's reorganization plan may not be easy to achieve. This is one reason. Mr. Di is willing to participate in a long-term cabinet. However, Prime Minister Gu Da Lai Si Ge is a new young Liberal Party member, and veterans such as former Finance Minister Bai La Xi Ya Nu have not joined. The internal unity of the new cabinet may be unreliable, and it is not yet known whether it can last. This is the second reason. Based on the above two reasons, Mr. Di may not be happy to cooperate with Da Da Lai Si Ge. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Negotiations on the Yuguan Takeover Issue Resume</h3>
<p>=The Japanese Side Requests an Exchange Plan=</p>
<p>=Tao Shangming Has Returned to Beiping for Instructions=</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Yuguan takeover is a diplomatic scene in North China that has been brewing for three months. Tao Shangming is the person in charge of handling this matter, traveling between Pingjin, Tangshan, and Yuguan, negotiating with the Japanese side. During this period, the Japanese side's attitude has changed repeatedly, which has led to repeated changes in principle. Before the Min incident occurred, the Japanese side was the active party in the issue of returning Yuguan. After the Min incident occurred, we were the active party, and the Japanese side became less active. Therefore, the distance on this matter seems to be getting farther and farther over the month. It was not until Tao Shangming returned to Beiping from Tangshan on the 3rd of this month to report that the news was revealed when he passed through Tianjin that the matter had recently gained momentum. It turned out that Tao Shangming went to Tangshan from Beiping in late December last year, and first organized the Luoyu Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Office. The official residence had been identified as the railway dormitory, but it was occupied by the Japanese army and returned after negotiations. However, the interior was too badly damaged and needed to be repaired. Therefore, the office was temporarily borrowed from the Qixin Cement Company. It could not be moved in until the repairs were completed. On the day before New Year's Eve (30th), Tao received a call from Yi Wo, the head of the Japanese special affairs agency in Yuguan, inviting him to meet. Tao went to Yuguan that night to meet Yi Wo. On New Year's Eve, they met again and thoroughly exchanged views on the issue of returning Yuguan. Yi Wo said that the Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army had recently appointed him as the plenipotentiary for the Yuguan issue. The Kwantung Army's intention was that there was no problem in returning Yuguan. The concern was that the current situation in Yuguan was very different from the past. Chinese and foreigners lived together, and government affairs were becoming increasingly complex. If China's measures after the takeover were improper, conflicts would occur, which would not only affect public security, but also cause other disturbances. Therefore, it was hoped that China could formulate a governance plan after recovering Yuguan at this moment, and submit it to him to report to the Kwantung Army Headquarters. If the Kwantung Army Headquarters believes that there is not much conflict of interest with the Japanese and Manchurian sides, China can implement the takeover. Other Manchurian institutions in Yuguan, etc., do not need to be studied and can withdraw unconditionally. Tao did not dare to express his opinion on this result, and promised to return to Beiping for instructions immediately. After drafting a plan, he would bring it back for negotiation. This was Tao's negotiation in Yuguan before New Year's Eve. He then left Yuguan and returned to Tangshan on New Year's Day. On the 2nd, he departed from Tangshan to Beiping. When passing through Tianjin, his whereabouts were kept secret, so few people knew. It is said that Tao plans to go to Yuguan again around the 10th of this month. If the Japanese do not make trouble with our plan, Yuguan may be recovered before the Spring Festival. Although the Japanese do not insist on returning Yuguan, the Maintenance Association organized in Yuguan and the general traitors deeply hope that this situation will never be cancelled, so that they can take advantage of the situation to steal political power. Some traitorous merchants transport Japanese goods and fear that after Yuguan is recovered, they will be boycotted or have increased taxes, so they also oppose the Japanese returning it. A few days ago, the newly appointed Magistrate of Linyu County, Yuan Tai, visited Yuguan and hosted a banquet for traitors and others. These people agreed not to attend. On the same evening, the Japanese hosted a banquet, and the traitors all attended. Four or five traitors secretly incited the Japanese, saying that Yuan Tai was a Communist. Therefore, Yuan has been viewed with jealousy by the Japanese since he took office. Although the issue of returning Yuguan this time seems to be unfolding, the general concern is that the traitors will provoke and prevent it. Therefore, although it is currently in progress, there may be many twists and turns when it is actually taken over, and it is not yet known. As for Tao Shangming's Luoyu Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Office, it plans to employ three secretaries, who are responsible for administration, diplomacy, and general affairs, and twelve clerks, who are responsible for archives, accounting, and documents. The original budget was 1,800 yuan per month. Recently, it has been requested that the Political Affairs Council should add more because there are still many shortages. (4th)</p>
<h3>Puyi is Advanced to Pseudo-Emperor</h3>
<p>=Pu Wei is Active in Pingjin=</p>
<p>=Pseudo-Constitution to be Announced Regularly=</p>
<p>=Pseudo-Government Still Headed by Japanese=</p>
<p>=Military Must Obey Tokyo=</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Under the supervision of Japan, the puppet Puyi of the Northeast pseudo-organization exercises an unfree regime. Due to various relationships, he will be announced as the pseudo-"Manchukuo Emperor" as early as the 15th of this month, and the official date of enthronement is still March 1st. At the same time, the pseudo-Manchukuo Constitution will be announced, and the Second Japan-Manchukuo Agreement will be signed. Among them, the cooperation methods for railways, minerals, and forests have already been decided internally. The Constitution is currently being drafted by Zhao Xinbo, the President of the Pseudo-Manchukuo Court, and others. Most of its principles are copied from the Japanese legal system. Puyi's brother, Pu Wei, secretly came to Pingjin a few days ago to meet with the Qing Clan elders. A certain elder of the Qing Clan opposed Puyi becoming the pseudo-Manchukuo Emperor, saying that Puyi was young and ignorant, and was being fooled by the Japanese. He was not free everywhere, and he was a great shame and humiliation under the Aisin Gioro clan system. Zheng Xiaoxu and others sought glory by selling out their country and were ungrateful, and were despised by the scholar-officials. Pu Wei did not get what he wanted, and then he tried to win over the poor elders of the Qing Clan. Finally, he found more than a dozen eunuchs from the Forbidden City, gave them generous salaries, and transported them to Changchun. Pu Wei also went to a certain concession in Tianjin to invite a banquet for frustrated politicians, and a certain foreign vagabond accompanied him. During the banquet, he gave a detailed report on the situation in Pseudo-Manchukuo. Yesterday, Pu Wei left Tianjin for Dalian and returned to Changchun. According to Japanese news, Pseudo-Manchukuo will be changed to an imperial system on January 15th, Puyi will be called Emperor, wearing a yellow dragon robe. The Japanese Emperor plans to give valuable gifts to express his congratulations. The Constitution may be promulgated on March 1st. From then on, Pseudo-Manchukuo will become a constitutional monarchy, with freedom of religion. However, the spread of Buddhism is absolutely welcome, and it is planned to preach in Changchun, Longjiang, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Andong, Liaoyuan, Dunhua, Huadian, Yitong, Wuchang, Acheng, Yanji, Shuangcheng, Fuyu, Suihua, Hulan, Anda, Gannan, Nenjiang, Aihun, Cheluk, Wuyun, Foshan, Xingdong, Chengde, Lingyuan, Chifeng, Longhua, Jianping, Fuxin, Suidong, Fengning, Weichang, Linxi and other counties in stages. In the future, the diplomacy, transportation, and military of Pseudo-Manchukuo will be concentrated in the Changchun Pseudo-Government. The highest advisor of the Changchun Pseudo-Government is a Japanese, and the military must obey the Japanese Kwantung Army or the Minister of the Army in Tokyo. (6th)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Prepares to Dominate All of Sichuan</h3>
<p>=Proposed Abolition of the Provincial Government=</p>
<p>=Establishment of a Rehabilitation Directorate=</p>
<p>=Finalizing Troop Reduction Plan=</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: After the Sichuan anti-Red Army forces, consisting of the Second Route under Tian Songyao, the Third Route under Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou, and the Fourth Route Army under Yang Sen, captured Yilong on December 30 of last year, the main force of the bandits in northwestern Sichuan retreated and gathered in Bazhong. Currently, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Route Armies have launched a general mobilization, advancing directly towards Bazhong, Nanjiang, and Tongjiang, with fierce battles occurring within the boundaries of these three counties. It is rumored that the bandits, recognizing the overwhelming power of the various armies, plan to concentrate in the large mountains along the Sichuan-Shaanxi border for a protracted defense, awaiting opportunities. As for He Long's bandit troops, who fled from the Hubei border to the Qianjiang area of eastern Sichuan, although they number around 20,000, they are unfamiliar with the terrain and face difficulties in obtaining supplies, making their development challenging. On December 25 of last year, Liu Xiang ordered the Fifth Route Army to suppress them and dispatched four aircraft for bombing. He also transferred the Fifth Division under Chen Mingqian, along with the garrison commanders of Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, and Pengshui, Tian Zhongyi, and the Qingxiang commander of Zhong County, Fengdu County, and Shizhu County, Zhou Huacheng, totaling over 10,000 men, under the command of Wang Lingji, the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route. After receiving the order, Wang immediately supervised his troops and launched an attack. On the 2nd of this month, they made contact with He Long's forces, and on the afternoon of the 3rd, they successfully recaptured Qianjiang. Currently, He Long's forces have dispersed and fled into the mountains along the Sichuan-Hunan border.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang, encouraged by the progress in the anti-bandit military operations, is planning to handle post-conflict affairs and unify all of Sichuan after the bandit suppression is complete. According to the preliminary plan, the Sichuan Rehabilitation Directorate will be expanded to exercise authority. Administrative, financial, construction, educational, group affairs, and public affairs matters in all counties of Sichuan will be directly managed and promoted by the Directorate. It is also planned to telegraph the central government in the shortest possible time to abolish the Sichuan Provincial Government, making the Rehabilitation Directorate the highest authority in Sichuan. In the future, the expanded Directorate will establish the following departments: 1) Military Affairs Department, 2) Civil Affairs Department, 3) Finance Department, 4) Education Department, 5) Group Affairs Department, 6) Construction Department. Liu Xiang will remain the Director, controlling all departments. It is said that Deng Xihou will be appointed as the head of the Military Affairs Department, while the head of the Civil Affairs Department may be Gan Diankui (Chief of Staff of the 21st Army) or Yang Sen. The position of Finance Department head is of great importance, and the candidate has not yet been decided. The heads of the Education and Construction Departments have also not been determined. Wang Fangzhou is rumored to be the head of the Group Affairs Department.</p>
<p>After the end of the anti-bandit military operations, Liu Xiang has also prepared a plan to reduce and reorganize the army. It is said that the entire Sichuan army will be reorganized into three armies, named the First, Second, and Third Armies of the Sichuan Army of the Republic of China. Adopting a three-three system, each army will consist of three divisions, with an attached independent brigade; each division will consist of three brigades, with an attached independent regiment; each brigade will consist of three regiments, with an attached independent battalion; each regiment will consist of three battalions, with an attached independent company; each battalion will consist of three companies, with an attached independent platoon; each company will consist of three platoons, with each platoon having 40 soldiers. The troops of the 21st Army will be reorganized into the First Army, the 28th and 29th Armies will be merged into the Second Army, and the 20th and 35th Armies, along with the 23rd Division of the Sichuan Border Defense Army, will be merged into the Third Army. Liu Xiang will concurrently serve as the commander of the First Army, with Tang Shizun (commander of the 1st Division of the 21st Army) serving as the commander-in-chief. Deng Xihou will be the commander of the Second Army, with Tian Songyao serving as the commander-in-chief. Yang Sen will be the commander of the Third Army, with Li Qixiang serving as the commander-in-chief. Liu Xiang is determined to implement the above plan, and if any army opposes it, he will suppress them by force. Since defeating Liu Wenhui, Liu Xiang's strength has increased several times. The commanders under Liu Xiang are: 1st Division Commander Tang Shizun, 1st Brigade Commander Peng Huanzhang, 2nd Brigade Commander Rao Guohua, 3rd Brigade Commander Liu Zhaoli; 2nd Division Commander Wang Zuanxu, 4th Brigade Commander Lin Yi, 5th Brigade Commander Liu Guangyu, 6th Brigade Commander Wang Zexun; 3rd Division Commander Wang Lingji, 7th Brigade Commander Xu Shaozong, 8th Brigade Commander Li Shufan, 9th Brigade Commander Zhang Bangben; 4th Division Commander Fan Shaozeng, 10th Brigade Commander Zhou Shaoxuan, 11th Brigade Commander Liao Kaixiao, 12th Brigade Commander Meng Hao; 5th Division Commander Chen Wanren, 13th Brigade Commander Da Fenggang, 14th Brigade Commander Yuan Rujun; Training Division Commander Pan Wenhua, 1st Brigade Commander Pan Wenhua, 2nd Brigade Fan Ziying, 3rd Brigade Guo Xun; Model Division Commander Liu Xiang, 1st Brigade Liu Xiang, 2nd Brigade Liao Haitao, 3rd Brigade He Kexiu; 1st Independent Brigade Fan Nanxuan, 2nd Independent Brigade Yang Guozhen, 3rd Independent Brigade Lin Meipo, 4th Independent Brigade Tian Zhongyi, 5th Independent Brigade Pan Zuo; Commander of the 1st Independent Detachment Wang Jie, Commander of the 3rd Independent Detachment Huang Qixian; Commander of the Provisional 1st Division of the Sichuan Army Yu Anmin, Commander of the 2nd Division Peng Chengfu; Commander of the 1st Border Defense Route Chen Lanting, Commander of the 2nd Border Defense Route Cheng Suzong, Commander of the 3rd Border Defense Route Deng Guozhang, Commander of the 4th Border Defense Route Wei Kai; Commander of the 1st Garrison Route Zhang Huafeng, Commander of the 2nd Garrison Route Wang Xueju, Commander of the 3rd Garrison Route Deng He; Commander of the 1st Guard Route Hao Yaoting, Commander of the 2nd Guard Route Ma Yunping, Commander of the 3rd Guard Route Cui Jinsheng; Guard Brigade Zhou Chenghu, Guard 1st Brigade Wang Xuejiang, Guard 2nd Brigade Li Yishou; Commander of the Xuyong Border Area Gu Jiahu; Commander of Zhong County, Fengdu County, and Shizhu County Zhou Huacheng; Machine Gun Commander Liu Bingxun; Artillery Commander Lan Tianyu; Aviation Commander Jiang Kui; Commander of the Sichuan River Public Security Fleet Jiang Kui; Tank Battalion Zhang Zhizhong; Tax Police Corps Tang Hua; Commander of the 1st Independent Regiment Yang Qinan, Commander of the 2nd Independent Regiment Li Chansheng, Commander of the 3rd Independent Regiment Tong Yi; Commander of the Southern Sichuan Border Defense Hou Zhidan; Garrison Commander of Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, and Pengshui Tian Guanwu; Garrison Commander of Chongqing Li Gengu; Garrison Commander of Chengdu Liao Ze.

<h3>Jiangxi Volunteer Corps Unanimously Cooperate to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>丨Victory Reports Sent in Succession丨</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi county anti-communist volunteer corps and security groups have assisted in bandit suppression and have achieved successive victories. Recently, Wanzai and other counties have sent telegrams reporting their victories in bandit suppression. The details are as follows: 1) Wanzai County Magistrate Zhou Jinlu telegraphed that the pseudo-Gaocheng District Guerrilla Force harassed the Suxi area under the county's jurisdiction. He immediately ordered Zhang Guoxiang, the head of the Second District, to lead the volunteer corps in a surprise attack at night. The bandits were caught off guard and fled in disorder. Six Red bandits were killed, and seven 79 rifles were seized. 2) Jinxi County Magistrate Zhu Shen telegraphed that the anti-communist volunteer corps of Huangtongdunhou detected that there were more than a hundred peasant bandits in Caoshui area under Zixi County. They immediately went to encircle and suppress them. They arrived at three o'clock and destroyed the pseudo-Third District Soviet Committee and two organs, seizing reactionary propaganda materials and several banners. At seven o'clock, they patrolled the areas of Kentou, Chexi, and Shuangkeng, arresting Shi Xinnian, a pseudo-transportation soldier. 3) Yifeng County Magistrate Liao Shiyuan telegraphed that the Tangpu volunteer corps of the county joined forces with the local militia to attack the bandits. The bandits were unable to resist and retreated to Pengyuan area. In this battle, two bandit company commanders, one platoon leader, and four bandit soldiers were killed, and one rifle was seized. 4) Anfu County Magistrate Li Cheng telegraphed that he personally led the local militia to search for bandits in Gugou and other places. They killed nine Red bandits, captured Zhang Songbai alive, rescued Wang Daxing, a kidnapped victim, and seized six Lefaucheux pistols, a load of reactionary publications, four large and small wooden seals, and one bandit flag. There were also many other items such as walking boots, cloth shoes, and grain bags. 5) Suichuan County Magistrate Su Zhuang telegraphed that he recently led the fifth team of the security group, together with the directly subordinate regiment of the security division, to suppress bandits, camping in Dakeng. The next day, they attacked the Wudoujiang area of the Fifth District and immediately summoned strong men to select suitable houses to rebuild blockhouses, and stationed the volunteer corps from Dakeng and other places. Yesterday morning, they attacked Huangnao in the Fifth District and engaged in a fierce battle with the pseudo-Independent Fourth Regiment, which had about 500 guns, at Shiwelzi. They occupied Huangnao at Shenshi. In this battle, more than a hundred bandits were killed, one bandit was captured alive, and three rifles were seized. The Red bandits regrouped their remnants and surrounded the unfinished blockhouses layer by layer. Fortunately, the volunteer corps defended to the death, and the various militia teams bravely charged forward, forcing the bandits to retreat to Che'ao. In this battle, seven bandits were killed, twenty bandits were wounded, and two rifles were seized. The directly subordinate regiment patrolled the upper and lower throats of Duxi in the Fourth District, achieving considerable gains. (January 5th)</p>

<h3>Ancient Tomb Discovered in Rizhao, Shandong</h3>
<p>Villagers Excavate Three Stone-Carved Beast-Headed Gate Towers</p>
<p>County Government Has Requested the Provincial Government to Send Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Shandong is an old state of Qi and Lu, and also the earliest developed area in China, so there are many ancient artifacts underground. Recent years have seen repeated discoveries. According to a person from Rizhao, the county recently discovered another ancient tomb. According to archaeologists, it is an ancient tomb from the Han Dynasty or earlier, and the news has alarmed the entire county. People from far and wide are coming to see it. The tomb is located in the southwest countryside of Rizhao County, about seven or eight miles from the county seat. Residents of Langdangpo Village were digging outside the village to build a new tomb a dozen days ago. When they dug to a depth of two or three feet, they suddenly discovered stone-carved animal heads, birds, and other objects, arranged neatly. Digging further down revealed a gate tower. When the villagers in nearby villages heard the news, they believed that there must be treasures underground, so they gathered laborers and went to help with the excavation. After several days, they discovered two more gates, which were slightly smaller in scale than the previous one, but their positions were in a straight line with the three gates. Some say that these are the main gate, the second gate, and the third gate of the ancient tomb. When the county government learned of this, considering that it concerned ancient artifacts and should not be excavated privately, it immediately sent police to the scene to stop the excavation and reported to the provincial government to send personnel to the county for inspection, and then consider the situation before the official excavation.

<h3>Lu West Disaster Victims Appeal for Dyke Closure</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Representatives of disaster victims from four counties in western Shandong - Puyang, Fan County, Shouzhang, and Yanggu - have petitioned the provincial government to urge the central government to quickly close the breach at Shitouzhai. Today, the disaster victim representatives drafted another telegram, requesting the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuju, to forward it to the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and Chairman Yu of Hebei Province (Xuezhong), urging them to expedite the closure of the breach. The original telegram states: "For the sake of appealing for the closure of the breach on the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, please urgently request your approval to forward this telegram to the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, and the Hebei Provincial Government Chairman Yu, so that they can grant permission to quickly close the breach, eliminate the flood disaster, and save the disaster victims. Last summer in July, a flood broke out, causing the embankment at Shitouzhai in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, to collapse and flood eight or nine counties in Hebei and Shandong provinces, extending about 300 li from east to west and 20 to 30 li from north to south, with depths of over ten feet in some places and several feet in others. Fields and crops were completely submerged, houses collapsed, and household belongings and livestock were mostly lost due to the rush to protect them. Many people suffered directly or indirectly, and the harm was incalculable. The water disaster was the fastest that had been experienced in past years. Time has passed, and half a year has passed, but the situation of the flood flooding is still the same as before. Now, as many festivals are approaching, thousands of disaster victims in Shandong Province are groaning between heaven and ice, and mourning is everywhere, with hunger crying in the world. The situation is truly unspeakable. The county government and charitable organizations have provided food, clothing, and epidemic prevention, but these are merely a drop in the bucket, only able to relieve the immediate crisis and unable to provide long-term peace. From the perspective of the disaster victims, meeting their needs for relief is urgent, but it is not as urgent as seeking to close the breach. It is also heard that the government has dispatched personnel to prepare for the closure of the breach, which the representatives are overjoyed to hear. They have personally gone to the site to inspect and have seen that although the embankment has been closed, the waterway has not yet been started. Even with equipment, the work is not being carried out with urgency. When asked about the reason, they said that there were no funds or materials. If this is delayed, there is no hope for the successful closure of the breach, and the disaster victims will never be able to escape the water. Furthermore, now that the weather is cold and the ice is freezing, the water flow is slightly reduced and slower, which is a great time for the closure work to be done with half the effort and twice the result. If it is delayed again and again, the main stream will roll far away and seize the water of the main river, causing it to flow entirely to the north, then even with sufficient funds and materials, the engineers will be helpless. The representatives have seen this and are deeply concerned, so they dare to risk presenting the disaster victims' ardent hope for the closure of the breach and the situation that the breach should be closed in a timely manner, and implore you to examine and approve this telegram and forward it to the government so that they can quickly close the breach to save the disaster victims. We await your orders with the utmost urgency." (6th)</p>

<h3>Key Criminal in the Han Case Returned for Retrial</h3>
<p>Han Wentai, the village head of Xu Xie Township in the Third District (Yangming Township), was kidnapped and brutally murdered by bandits in March of last year. Six criminals, including Yang Abao, Zhou Zhihe, Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, Yuan Yonghe, and Luo Sanxing, were successively apprehended. Except for Yuan Yonghe, who was found to be innocent after interrogation and released by the prosecutor's office, Li Zhiping and Jiang Hanchen were found to have provided conclusive evidence and were sentenced to death by the county court and submitted to the province for approval. For a time, the people's hearts were greatly pleased. The remaining three, Yang Abao and others, are still under interrogation and awaiting trial. Unexpectedly, Li and the others are very influential. Before the verdict was made, they entrusted people to make representations everywhere, hoping to avoid death. However, yesterday, it was learned from the provincial investigation that Li had done party work and had contributed to the party and the country. The provincial government has now returned the case to the original court for retrial. Han Keliang, the son of the victim, has also submitted a request to the provincial government, requesting that the two criminals, Li and Jiang, be executed as soon as possible to serve as a warning.</p>

<h3>County Magistrate Detained After Going to the Province</h3>
<p>Changshu County Magistrate Zhou Heng has been in office for less than a year. Due to dissatisfaction with public opinion, he has been repeatedly accused by citizens. The provincial government has sent personnel to Changshu several times to investigate. Later, he was accused by local citizens of smoking opium. After deliberation by the county party headquarters, the case was submitted to the provincial party headquarters and then to the provincial government, requesting that a designated hospital be asked to conduct a test. On New Year's Day this year, County Magistrate Zhou suddenly received an order to go to the province. He initially stayed at the Jiangnan Hotel. On the 4th, when he met with Director Gu of the Department of Civil Affairs, he was immediately taken into a car and sent to the Provincial Hospital at Xiaomatou for testing. Whether or not he is addicted to opium is now known to the province for certain. Zhou is currently staying in ward 11 of the second-class ward of the hospital. The doctor, Zhao Zhengxian, tested his urine that day. Now, he must test his whole body, which will take a week. The Department of Civil Affairs has also sent personnel to monitor the hospital.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Actively Dredges the Liutang River</h3>
<p>The Liutang River in Jiangsu Province connects the Jiulongmiao Wuhua Bridge Liu Laojian of the Middle Canal, carrying the waters of the Kang, Yi, Si, and Zhu rivers, and passes through the seven counties of Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, Shuyang, Lianshui, Guanyun, and Donghai, entering the sea at the Guanhe River estuary. Its flow and health are critical to the water conservancy of northern Jiangsu. The middle reaches of the river are silted up and shallow, the river surface is too narrow, and most of the dikes and embankments have been damaged. Northern Jiangsu has suffered disasters in nine out of ten years, mostly due to this. The Huai River Guidance Committee has long included the guidance of the Yi and Si rivers in the Huai River guidance plan. Dredging the Liutang River is the most urgent project of the Yi and Si rivers project. In order to save the people of northern Jiangsu from river disasters as soon as possible, the provincial government decided to raise 500,000 yuan to repair the Liutang River first, and organized the Liutang River Dredging Project Office, hiring Xu Dingkang, the director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, to serve as the director of the office concurrently. The county magistrates of the counties along the river served as section chiefs. The Project Office was established on December 10 of last year. Except for the Suqian section, which was allowed to be established later due to the small scope of the project, the engineering offices of Lianshui, Siyang, and Huaiyin counties were established simultaneously on December 18 of last year, and the engineering offices of Shuyang, Donghai, and Guanyun counties were established on December 20 of last year. The people of each county are deeply concerned about the benefits and harms of this project, and the conscription of laborers has been very enthusiastic. The Lianshui section started work on the 2nd of this month, and the other counties will also start work soon.</p>

<h3>Provincial Government Re-investigates Gaoyou Case</h3>
<p>Yang Jianru, the county magistrate of Gaoyou County, Zhang Tingjie, the standing committee member of the county party headquarters, and Wu Yuceng, the director of the property management office, were previously accused by the people of the county and the fellow villagers association in Shanghai to the provincial government of colluding in corruption and illegally collecting money. The province ordered the Ninth District Commissioner's Office to send Lv Dajun to investigate, but the case has not yet been resolved. It is now learned that someone has also filed a complaint with the Military Affairs Commission. Chairman Chiang ordered the provincial government to re-investigate. The provincial government specially appointed Wu Guangfu to come to Yangzhou to jointly investigate with Commissioner Ma on the 5th. The investigation has now been completed and will be jointly reported to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<h3>Silk Shop Clerk Leaves Suicide Note and Flees</h3>
<p>Lin Guirong, who worked as a clerk at Yuanlong Silk Shop on Ningbo Road in Shanghai, is a native of Cixi, 31 years old. He is quite honest and careful in his daily work, and has no hobbies. This time, he did not know what kind of feeling he was under, and he left the store and fled. Although his colleagues in the shop searched everywhere, there was still no trace of him. While they were in shock, they suddenly received a letter from Lin Guirong delivered by the post office, but there was no specific address. After carefully examining the postmark, it was sent from Hangzhou. The shop believed that Lin Guirong might still be stranded in Hangzhou, so they wrote to Yuanlong Silk Shop in Hangzhou, asking them to send someone to investigate. They also intend to offer a reward to find Lin's whereabouts, in order to avoid a tragedy.</p>

<h3>Water Police Arrest Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>He Qinghua, the leader of the Second Squad of the First Brigade of the Water Police stationed in Linghu, received a report on the 3rd of this month from a water-fire gang robber, who said that the bandit gang had unevenly distributed the spoils. He reported to the team that the gang's stolen boats were hidden in Xia'ang Shuanglin and other places, and that they had drowned Yang Achun, a debt collector, in Qianshan Lake in September of last year, tying a large stone to his body. After receiving the report, the squad leader immediately led the team to Xia'ang Shuanglin and other places, seizing more than ten stolen boats from the water-fire gang and arresting more than thirty suspected bandits. They escorted all the gangs to the Linghu team headquarters for verification.</p>

<h3>Salt Police Cause Trouble, Bureau Chief Suffers</h3>
<p>Wang Sanhuai, an inspector of the business-run Salt Police Bureau at Ningbo Haohetou, went to the Dashijie Recreation Ground on Zhongshan Road to watch a play with a friend at about 8 pm on December 31 of last year. The gatekeeper of the ground refused to let them in because they were taking friends to see a free show, which led to an argument. The two sides ended up fighting. At that time, Yu Jimin, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, was holding a wine meeting at the Shenzhou Hotel across the street. When he heard the news, he went to stop them. There were so many people and hands, and he was beaten on the head and other places. The Public Security Bureau, whose chief was beaten, sent a large number of police to surround the Salt Police Bureau, arresting all the salt police in the bureau and the staff of the salt permit office. They confiscated one long gun and one wooden-cased gun. They also dispatched detectives to round up the salt police. The Fourth Branch sent four salt police (who were patrolling the Bund on the north bank of the Jiangbei) and one wooden-cased gun with a row of bullets. The First Branch arrested one salt policeman. Then, detectives were dispatched to arrest Li Houxiang, the chief of the Salt Police Bureau, and sent him to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. He was stripped of his clothes, tortured, and detained. At about 12 o'clock, Ding Yaonan, the chief of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, interrogated Wang Shenggui and other five salt police. Because they were serving on the Jiangbei bank, they were released at the same time as Fan Xuezhuang, a staff member of the Salt Permit Office. The remaining thirteen salt police officers and the troublemaking inspector Wang Sanhuai were transferred to the Second Sub-office of the Security Office for handling. The Chief of the Salt Police Bureau also went out at this time. The inspector of the Ningbo Supervisory Office believed that the case was serious and telegraphed the province for instructions. At the same time, both the Public Security Bureau and the Salt Police Bureau telegraphed the province. It is now heard that all the salt police are still detained in the Security Sub-office, and it is not known how it will end.</p>
<h3>Xiangning Steamer Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>The Xiangning Steamer of the Ningbo Xiangshan Company, which departed from Ninghai for Ningbo at 9 a.m. on the 31st of last month with more than a hundred passengers, was infiltrated by more than ten Taizhou bandits. At 2:30 p.m., when the ship sailed to the Sanjiao waters of Xiangshan Port, the bandits opened fire and robbed the passengers of their silver coins, luggage, and better-quality clothes. At 12:30 a.m. that night, when the ship was forced to Baitaimen, it was discovered by Yao, a patrol officer of the Second Brigade of the Water Police, in a patrol boat. He ordered the ship to stop for inspection and forced the shipowner, Xie Rongzhang, to speed away. He resisted with a pistol. Officer Yao and others supervised more than a hundred water police officers and pursued in ten patrol boats. They could not succeed after several hours, so they gave up. The ship was hit by dozens of bullets. Hu Hanfa, a sailor, was scratched by a bullet, but fortunately he was not seriously injured. Wang A'gen, a passenger, was hit by a bullet in the waist and died immediately. He Chenglin, a passenger, was shot and killed for resisting the bandits, and his body was thrown into the sea. At 3:30 a.m. on the 1st, the ship arrived in the strait at the bottom of Baitaimen. The bandits seized five small boats, carried the loot across to the boats, and kidnapped more than 20 people, including accountant Gu Wenbing and passenger Lu Ziliang. At 6 a.m. at dawn, the ship was finally free. At noon on the 2nd, it returned to Ningbo. Most of the passengers left in embarrassment. The estimated value of the lost luggage was five or six thousand yuan, and the accountant's office lost 300 yuan in silver.</p>

<h3>Swindled of a Large Sum of Money in Meat Ransom</h3>
<p>The four families of Xu Ren-shi, Xu Ren-lai, Xu Ren-yun, and Xu Shen-shi, in Shuangju Township, District 10 of this county, were first looted by bandits. Before leaving, the bandits kidnapped Xu Ren-shi's son, Yong-sui, and three others, as previously reported. Now, it is heard that the bandits demanded that Ren-shi and others pay a ransom of two thousand yuan in foreign currency. Ren-shi and the others, facing financial difficulties and unable to raise the money immediately, initially paid nine hundred yuan in cash. The bandits released two of the captives. Subsequently, Sun Huan-chen and his son, residents near the township's border, arrived at Ren-shi's residence late one night, claiming that the remaining two captives, a boy and a girl, were at their home. The bandits had instructed them to come and urge Ren-shi to redeem them. Ren-shi and the others, believing this to be true, gathered the remaining one thousand one hundred yuan and went with Huan-chen to redeem the captives. However, upon arriving at Huan-chen's home, Huan-chen immediately extinguished the lantern. Ren-shi saw four bandits along with Huan-chen and his son, but no sign of the boy and girl. The bandits then forced Ren-shi to hand over the one thousand one hundred yuan in cash, which they took away. They told Ren-shi and the others to return home and hang a lit lantern at their door, and they would soon send the boy and girl back. However, after waiting until dawn without anyone returning, they realized they had been deceived.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Land Reorganization Work in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>— He Jie-fu</p>
<p>Last year, Wu Zhong-xin, while in charge of Anhui's administration, deeply believed that land reorganization was an urgent and unavoidable task. He proposed it at a provincial government standing committee meeting, which decided to establish an office for preparation. On September 10th of this year, the Anhui Provincial Land Reorganization Preparatory Office was established. The originally planned preparation period was four months, which was then extended by two months. On April 16th of this year, it was renamed the Anhui Provincial Land Reorganization Office, with He Chong-jie and Li Yong-bin continuing as Director and Deputy Director, respectively. The current state of affairs is reported in the following, divided into past, present and future sections, highlighting key points.</p>
<p>A. Past Overview ㈠ Collecting Land Administration Books and Maps: Reorganizing land is a complex and demanding task. Although this province previously established land administration agencies, they were short-lived and never implemented actual surveys. When ordered to prepare previously, the office believed that collecting land administration books and maps would be essential for reference. It sent letters to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces, requesting various land administration regulations, books, and maps. More than thirty types were received and used for reference. ㈡ Promoting the Meaning of Reorganization: The land in Anhui Province has not been surveyed for a long time. The current reorganization is a novel undertaking. There were concerns that the people might be suspicious or even resist, hindering progress. The office wrote articles and edited special publications, and drafted various vernacular proclamations, to explain the meaning and benefits of land reorganization. These were printed and distributed widely to promote understanding. Operations have been relatively smooth since the beginning. ㈢ Establishing Various Regulations: Reorganization steps include surveying, measuring, registering, licensing, evaluating, and enumeration. Although the Land Law has been promulgated, its implementation period has not been defined, and its detailed rules have not been drafted. Each province has been establishing individual regulations for land administration. Therefore, this province, based on the principles of the Land Law, considering its own situation, and referring to precedents in other provinces, formulated a land reorganization plan and regulations and forms for surveying, measuring, registering, licensing, and evaluating. More than twenty types were successively submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. ㈣ Pilot Land Surveying and Measuring: The purpose of land reorganization is to rectify boundaries, determine property rights, and equalize taxes. It must start with surveying and measuring to achieve effective results. The survey and measure is a substantial task, requiring adequate personnel, equipment, and economic time estimation. A suitable calculation must be made to maximize the benefit of the effort. At the beginning of the preparation, the office requested the provincial government to designate the Eight Lakes area as a pilot area for surveying and measuring, aiming to use scientific methods to determine accurate indicators of economic time in this area and then promote them throughout the province to provide a standard. Starting from November 16th of last year, forty students who had graduated from junior high school or above were selected and trained at the county land surveying bureau as a training center, with eight team leaders assigned. They were taught subjects such as surveying, cartography, drawing techniques, and the use of instruments. At the same time, two other team leaders were assigned to select a baseline in Eight Lakes and measure fifteen small triangulation points. On November 30th, the academic instruction was completed, and the baseline and triangulation points were completed on schedule. On December 1st, team leaders were sent to develop each triangulation point using right-angle coordinates. Each team then carried out auxiliary graphic surveys based on these points. The predetermined survey area of Eight Lakes covers approximately three hundred square miles, with varying terrain complexity. In low-lying areas, only higher field ridges appear above the water surface. The intersection angles and side lengths of triangulation auxiliary points, as well as the design of traverses, auxiliary point connections, and side length numbers, must be within appropriate limits, which is often not possible in reality. Detailed planning and overall consideration are necessary to avoid focusing on one aspect while neglecting others. Although the surveyed area was relatively difficult, except for rainy days when work could not be performed, charting, selecting points, intersections, and traverses were completed in about ten days, and over two thousand six hundred points were gradually completed. The main control network has also fully covered the ground. After December 15th, all surveyors began surveying based on the measured control points. However, due to the severe winter with rain and snow, work could not proceed, and surveying was suspended on January 20th to avoid waste. On February 6th, as the weather gradually cleared, surveying resumed, using the light method, traverse method, semi-traverse method, and measuring the ground distance. Diagonal lines or direction lines were also measured for inspection. When the distance could not be actually measured, the three-point intersection method was used to determine the true position of the point and line. As the deadline approached, the shape of each field was drawn, and the names of the owners were mostly filled in on the map based on oral reports from the Baojia leaders. Those not verified will be supplemented during registration. By March 10th, all surveying was completed. All field personnel returned to the office and began internal work on March 13th, handling mapping and area calculation. The results showed that the total area of the entire area was more than one hundred thirty-seven hundred plots, consisting of one hundred and six thousand and six hundred mu. B. Current Situation ㈠ Conducting Land Registration: With the completion of surveying work in the Eight Lakes pilot area, land registration should be conducted according to regulations to determine property rights and equalize land taxes. The Eight Lakes Pilot Area Land Registration Office was established on June 1st, and the Land Evaluation Committee and Land Price Evaluation Committee were also established at the same time. At that time, it was summer, and the Yangtze River was overflowing. The pilot area is located near the Yangtze River, with low-lying terrain. People were rushing to protect the dikes day and night, and had no time for this. Chen Chun-ti and other business owners in the area requested an extension of fifty days, which was approved by the provincial government. As the deadline approached, an order was received from the Ministry of the Interior through the provincial government, temporarily suspending registration. It was argued that land registration must be carried out immediately after the land has been surveyed to ensure accuracy. If it is delayed for too long, the ridges and boundaries will change, and the transfer of property rights will occur at any time, causing more difficulties. After recounting seven reasons, it was submitted to the provincial government for deliberation, and it was ordered to continue the operation. It was decided that October 1st to 30th would be the period for continued registration. Before the deadline, announcements were printed and distributed, notices were published in newspapers, and letters were sent to the county governments of Huaining and Dongliu for assistance. Meetings were convened with business owners in the provincial capital and Dadu River to explain the benefits of registration, and letters were printed and sent to each household to urge registration. As of now, landowners who have applied for registration account for more than fourteen thousand mu. The majority has not registered. The reasons can be attributed to two types: ㈠ Many of the large business owners in the area are scattered far away, and they may not have been fully informed. ㈡ Since the flood in 1931 broke the dikes, resulting in a major disaster, and the low grain prices in the past two years, business owners have not been able to collect rent, resulting in delays. In order to solve the first type of difficulty, an order was requested and approved to extend the deadline for another month. Regarding the second type, business owners such as Song Chu-cai requested the modification of various fee collection regulations to reduce the burden on the people. An order was received to submit it for discussion, and a written reply has been submitted and awaits instructions. ㈡ Surveying Anqing City: Anqing is the northern city of the dual-linked city designated in Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Strategy. The southern city is the Eight Lakes area, which is undergoing a pilot survey. With the completion of the survey work in Eight Lakes, a plan for surveying the land registration of the streets in Anqing City was submitted to the provincial government and approved. The surveying of triangulation points began on April 1st and was completed on May 15th. On July 6th, the surveying of traverses began, divided into six groups and carried out simultaneously. It was completed on August 25th. After the traverses were completed, a household registration survey was conducted, with four survey teams organized. Work began on July 25th and ended on September 18th. Most of it has been investigated and prepared. The unfinished part will be handled by the land surveying staff. Land surveying began on September 19th, following the precedent of Eight Lakes, divided into ten groups, each with one team leader and four surveyors, and a number of assistants, with a deadline of December 5th for the completion of the survey. As of recently, nine-tenths of the entire area has been surveyed, and it can be completed within the deadline. ㈢ Surveying Wuhu City: The office drafted a plan for reorganizing the land in Anhui Province, stipulating that the land in each county should be reorganized within three years, with each three years as a period. The first period was set for Huaining, Dongliu, and Wangjiang counties. The land measurement of the streets in Anqing City, Huaining, is about to be completed. It should then be extended to the four villages of Huaining and the two counties of Dongliu and Wangjiang. However, the current financial resources of this province are limited. The budget for land reorganization expenses in this year is extremely small, making it difficult to proceed according to the original plan. It is proposed to temporarily conduct land surveying of the streets in Wuhu, as it is considered to be a smaller scope and easier to achieve success. Wuhu is located in the central part of the Yangtze River and is a major port in Anhui Province. Commerce is prosperous, and the people have a higher level of knowledge, making it easier to understand land administration. A land surveying plan for the streets of Wuhu has been prepared and submitted to the provincial government for approval. As some of the personnel involved in the surveying of Anqing City have completed their work, two team leaders were sent to the area with two surveyors on November 1st of this year to begin selecting and surveying small triangulation points.</p>

Future Plans ㈠ Plan to Survey Datong and Bengbu: Once the survey in Anqing is completed, it is planned to move the entire team to Wuhu for surveying, and gradually survey the streets of Datong and Bengbu. If the funds are allocated on time, it is expected that everything can be completed before June 1934. ㈡ Extend to the Three Counties of Huaining, Dongliu, and Wangjiang: The office's budget for 1934 is being prepared, and it is planned to start surveying the four villages of Huaining and the two counties of Dongliu and Wangjiang at the beginning of that year, based on the land reorganization plan, aiming to complete it in three years, as originally planned for the first phase of work. ㈢ Surveying the Large Triangulation Network of the Entire Province: To achieve precise surveying, it is necessary to survey the triangulation to control the maps. The Ministry of the Interior previously ordered that land surveying should be based on large triangulation. It is appropriate to comply with this requirement. It is planned to survey the large triangulation network of each county in the province at the beginning of the 1934 budget year, in order to merge the maps with neighboring provinces and facilitate matching.</p>

<h3>The State of Various Industries in China in 1933</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn, flour, vermicelli, and silk cocoon industries are declining daily.</p>
<p>Only the match industry is developing, adding eleven new factories.</p>
<p>The state of Chinese industry and commerce in 1933, as announced by the Bureau of International Trade, is as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Since the major floods in 1931, the cotton yarn industry in China has been deteriorating. The situation in 1933 was even worse, due to the decline of the rural economy, the weakness of the people's purchasing power, and the sluggish sales of yarn in the interior. Disasters and wars in various regions were also a major cause. In previous years, cotton yarn transactions in March reached 3,000 to 4,000 bales sold per day, but last year, the maximum was 200 to 300 bales per day, or even just over 100 bales. The situation of depression can be seen from this. By March, the stock of yarn in ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou reached over 210,000 bales, worth approximately 37.9 million yuan. As a result, excessive inventory caused prices to plummet. However, cotton, as a domestic product in short supply, did not exhibit this phenomenon. Compared to the lowest price of yarn in March of last year, the price had fallen by 24 taels. Therefore, yarn factories in various regions were operating at a loss. The Chinese Cotton Mill Association, as a passive relief measure, implemented work reduction measures starting at the end of April. As of June, the number of yarn factories that had completely stopped work nationwide had reached eleven, accounting for 340,000 spindles. Three factories had stopped night work, accounting for 110,000 spindles, which already accounted for 15% of the total number of spindles in Chinese factories. By August, the number of spindles stopped had reached over 500,000.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Last year, the flour industry, due to sluggish flour sales and low prices, declined in the same way as the cotton spinning industry. The flour industry is one of the main industries in China, with factories throughout the country. Jiangsu Province is the most developed, and the northern regions are the largest sales markets. Sales were even stronger in the Northeast and Tianjin. After the loss of the Northeast, it suffered a major blow. Last year, Tianjin and other ports also faced cheap dumping of Japanese and Russian flour, making it difficult for sales to recover immediately. Merchants in Nanyang, Fuzhou, and Xiamen did not dare to purchase, and transactions were sparse. Sales of second-class flour almost completely stopped last year. Therefore, inventory piled up. In Shanghai alone, as of August, various factories had a total of 3 million bags of flour and 3.2 million dan of wheat in stock. Trading firms had a floating stock of 650,000 dan of wheat, totaling 10.7 million bags. Stocks in Wuxi, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places were also around 2 million bags. Due to the accumulation of inventory, factories announced a suspension of work after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Later, due to the livelihood issues of workers, they took turns starting up, so the decline of the flour industry was several times worse than in previous years.</p>
<p>Silk Cocoons</p>
<p>Last year, China's silk industry remained in a state of decline. There were originally over 180 silk reeling factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with over 48,000 silk reeling machines. At the beginning of last year, due to the dumping of Japanese silk and the competition of artificial silk, the silk market became even more depressed. In February and March, only about 20 silk factories were operating. In June and July, the overseas silk market surged, and over 100 Japanese silk reeling factories were operating, with over 30,000 silk reeling machines. This was the peak period for the silk industry last year. After July, silk prices fell steadily, and many factories were unable to maintain operations and stopped work one after another. By the beginning of October, the number of silk factories operating in Shanghai was less than 20, and 25 in Wuxi. By the beginning of December, only six were operating, and then all stopped work. The number of unemployed workers reached over 600,000. The decline of the silk industry can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>In 1933, tea prices were even lower than in 1932. The number of tea warehouses in various regions was invisibly reduced by half. Merchants who purchased raw tea were also affected by financial difficulties and past failures. Therefore, the pre-determined tea purchase price was only 60% to 70% of that in 1932. Although domestic sales decreased, exports increased by more than 10%.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>China's coal mine reserves total 212,114,000,000 tons, but the annual output is only 25 to 26 million tons, only one ten-thousandth of the total. Therefore, there was no progress in the coal industry in 1933. As for China's cement industry, the production volume was 2.3 million barrels, while sales reached 3 million barrels. The remaining 700,000 barrels were imported from foreign countries, mostly from Japan. The match industry is developing daily. Last year, eleven new factories were established, adding 92 new trademarks. Therefore, there are now over 100 match factories in China. Other industries, such as the rubber industry, experienced a significant decline in business conditions last year compared to previous years.</p>
<h3>Sun and Zhang Arrive Today</h3>
<p>Sun Zhe-sheng Arrives This Morning</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, traveled south by sea with his wife, and made a detour to Hong Kong and Guangdong, where he contacted Hu Han-min, Chen Ji-tang, Zou Lu, and other Southwest committee members to discuss the current situation. After completing this, he and his wife took the Dollar Line's "President Grant" back to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive at the port at around 7:00 AM this morning. Liang Han-cao, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, committee members Ma Chao-jun, Chen Jian-ru, Wu Jing-xiong, Liu Wei-chi, Vice Minister of Industry, Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others are expected to take a small steamboat across the river to the Dollar Line pier in Bailianjing, Pudong at around 7:00 AM this morning to welcome them.

<p>Zhang Xue-liang Arrives This Afternoon</p>
<p>Zhang Xue-liang, former Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, has been traveling in Europe for half a year. Zhang has now been recalled by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, and is returning to China on the Italian liner "Conte Verde." He passed through Hong Kong and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at around 4:00 PM this afternoon. Important figures such as Song Zi-wen, Standing Committee member of the Economic Committee, Wu Tie-cheng, Mayor of Shanghai, Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau, and Zhang's former colleagues Zhu Guang-mu, Hu Yu-kun, Zhou Da-wen, and Hu Ruo-yu are planning to go to the pier to welcome him. The ship was originally scheduled to dock at the Qichang Pier in Pudong, but in order to facilitate Zhang's disembarkation, the company changed the docking location to the Gonghexing Pier in Hongkou. However, it is heard that the relevant authorities will still send a small steamboat from the Jianghai Customs Pier to meet him, to avoid overcrowding. Other passengers will disembark at the pier. Zhang's temporary residence in Shanghai has been decided to be No. 2 Molier Road, where he will stay after arriving in Shanghai. It is heard that after a brief rest after arriving in Shanghai, he will go to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and meet with Chiang, Wang, and others in Nanjing. In addition to the famous Italian aviator who is coming to China to teach aviation, those who came to Hong Kong to welcome Zhang include Zhang's former colleagues Liu Yi-fei, Rong Zhen, Bao Wen-yue, Mi Chun-lin, Tang Guo-zhen, Liu Ming-jiu, and Feng Yong.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Actively Expands Business</h3>
<p>=Test Flight of Southwest Route to Be Completed Within a Week=</p>
<p>=Latest Aircraft to Be Used on All Routes to Benefit Passengers and Mail=</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation is a joint venture between China and the United States that has been in operation for over three years. Since the company's manager, Dai En, took the initiative to proceed, it has completed three major routes one after another, and its business has developed quite well. The current situation and development plans of the company's various routes are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>=Completion of Three Major Routes=</p>
<p>At the beginning of its operation, the company drafted a plan for three major routes, aiming to first penetrate the air transport of major commercial ports in various provinces and cities, and then gradually develop the border provinces to complete the national air network. Over the years, the company has faced many difficulties, but it has still worked hard to complete the work of the three major routes. Finally, the Shanghai-Beiping route was officially opened on January 10 last year, the Chongqing-Chengdu route on November 11, and the Shanghai-Guangdong route on October 24. Since then, north-south and east-west air transport has been connected, benefiting both Chinese and foreign people. The Chongqing-Chengdu route is particularly convenient, as water and land transport between Chengdu and Chongqing takes ten days to reach, but now it only takes two hours to reach.</p>
<p>=Test Flight of Southwest Route=</p>
<p>Since the company completed the three major routes, it is now preparing to develop the national aviation industry and connect the air transport of Hubei, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces. It has prepared the southwest route from Hankou, via Changsha, Longzhou, and Kunming, to Chongqing. On November 30th, at 9:15 AM, Nie Kai-yi, Director of the company's Flight Group, Huang Bao-xian, Director of the Business Group, and pilot An Lishun took off from Hankou on Aircraft No. 11 for a test flight. They arrived in Yunnan (Kunming) on the 1st and stayed there to inspect the airport and negotiate everything. Once the negotiations are completed, they will continue to move forward from Kunming within the day. The company plans to arrange stations along the route as soon as the test flight is completed, so that it can be opened as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>=Ordering New Aircraft=</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the take-off and landing of aircraft, the company has built two runways at Longhua Airport. Considering the prosperity of commerce and the extraordinary development of passenger and mail services between Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, and Chengdu, in order to seek stability and comfort and shorten the journey time, it plans to use the latest aircraft this summer. The aircraft is currently being prepared, and its average flight speed is 150 miles (approximately 450 li), which is one-third faster than the current aircraft. In the future, it will leave Shanghai in the morning, arrive in Hankou at noon, and the entire mail can be delivered in the afternoon. Leaving Hankou the next morning, it can also arrive in Chengdu at noon on the same day. Then, Shanghai and Chengdu will only be a two-day journey, and it will only take ten hours in the air.</p>
<p>=Cultivating Chinese Talent=</p>
<p>Although the company is a joint venture between China and the United States, the contract is only for ten years, and now it has been more than three years, and six and a half years will be full-term. At that time, it will be run solely by China. However, at the beginning of the company's operation, the pilots and radio operators were all foreign personnel. At present, one part of the radio has been taken over by our Chinese personnel, and our Chinese personnel also occasionally handle the repair of aircraft, which has been quite effective. The six-and-a-half-year period will be here in a flash, so the company pays special attention to cultivating talent, in order to prepare for future use.</p>

<h3>The Yu Ji Steamer Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Crew Members Discuss the Truth of the Accident</p>
<p>Losses Reach 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Yu Ji steamer of the Yu Da Shipping Company, after hitting a reef outside the Wenzhou estuary near Donggua Deng Mountain last month, was towed to Rui'an by the Sanjiang steamer. After repairs to the damaged area, which took more than half a month, the steamer set sail for Shanghai on the 4th of this month and arrived at port at 10:00 AM yesterday. It is temporarily docked at the Datong Company pier in the Nanshi district and will soon enter the dock for major repairs. A Datong News Agency reporter visited the steamer to investigate, and the details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Matters</h3>
<p>The Military Situation in Fujian Province and the State of the Shipyard</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Chen Shaokuan, the Minister of the Navy and concurrently the Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 7:30 AM yesterday. Upon disembarking, he went directly to Gaochang Temple, where he was met by Chen Xunyong, the Commander of the Naval Training Corps, and Luo Yicheng, the Chief of the Ordnance Department. The reporter called on him to inquire about the military situation in Fujian Province and the situation of the Jiangnan Shipyard over the past year. The details of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Military Situation in Fujian</p>
<p>Chen stated first, "The military situation in Fujian Province is currently in fierce battle. The Central Army's progress is exceptionally smooth, and Yanping has already been occupied. It is only one day from Yanping waterway into Fuzhou, but it takes three days to go upstream from Fuzhou to Yanping. The distance between them is about two hundred and several tens of miles. Therefore, Fuzhou can be captured easily when the navy applies pressure from the east. Although Gutian is still in the hands of the Fujian army, the details are unknown, but it is heard that the main battle will begin there."</p>
<p>Coastal Advancement</p>
<p>Chen also stated, "Commander Li Mengbin is currently in Changmen, and Commander Chen Jiliang is still stationed in Sandu, coordinating all naval vessels' defense and offensive matters. Changmen was recovered early by Commander Li's fleet, which has already sailed into the Ma Jiang River. As for the coastal counties, Ningde is entirely in the hands of the navy, and only a part of Luoyuan belongs to the navy. The Marines have not yet crossed the Baihe and Feiluan Mountains. If these two mountains are occupied, Luoyuan will have no defense to rely on, and the rebellious army will have no choice but to withdraw from Luoyuan. Lianjiang is currently still occupied by the Fujian army."</p>
<p>Firing at Mawei</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked, "Since Lianjiang is located on the north side of the Ma Jiang River, and Lianjiang is still in the hands of the Fujian army, how can the navy sail into the Ma Jiang River?" Chen replied, "Fuzhou has a vast area, no different from Shanghai being a general name. If we compare Mawei and Lianjiang, they are like Wusong and Pukou. Lianjiang penetrates deep into the interior, no different from Kunshan and Suzhou. Therefore, the distance is still far, and the naval fleet's entry is not threatened by the enemy. As for the current front line, it is a military matter and cannot be disclosed. I (Chen referring to himself) have not received any telegrams about the navy opening fire to bombard the enemy, because I received a telegram from Commander Li in Changmen yesterday (actually the day before yesterday) that did not mention the navy opening fire. In short, based on the current situation, the fall of Fuzhou is not a problem at all. It is only a matter of time."</p>
<p>Two Days of Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Currently, Luoyuan is entirely in the midst of a fierce battle between the Marines and the enemy. The Fujian army, led by Qiu Zhaochen with three regiments, pressed towards the Marines on the 2nd of this month, leading to a fierce battle. As a result, they retreated after being defeated, with deaths on both sides. After this battle, the enemy army was naturally replenished with a small number of troops, so they are still in a stalemate in Baihe Ridge today. The entire Fujian war began on November 18th and 19th of last year, and the most intense naval battle was on the 2nd and 3rd. The enemy launched the main attack, so their casualties were heavier than ours. At that time, the reporter asked whether any wounded soldiers from our side after this hard-fought battle would be transported to Shanghai for treatment. Chen replied, "This is not necessary, because our navy in Fujian still has hospitals. Moreover, the navy originally had rescue ships and medical ships at sea, docked nearby."</p>
<p>Future Trends</p>
<p>The reporter asked how the Fujian army would retreat in the future, given the severe pressure from the Central Army. Chen said, "Problems have already arisen within the Fujian army. As we all know, Dai Ji has fled to Hong Kong. Yesterday's news said that Jiang Guangnai has also secretly left Fujian Province. The future trend is that the Fujian army has long been in contact with the Communist bandits. When there is no other choice, in addition to directly surrendering to the Central Army, some of them will have to retreat to Jiangxi Province and cooperate with the Communists. However, most of the soldiers are from Guangdong Province, so they will surrender to Guangdong for resettlement. This is a matter of fact."</p>
<p>Chen Does Not Go in Person</p>
<p>The Navy's expenditures during the military period are naturally more extensive than usual, but the funding is still the same as before. As for the question of the army being transferred to Wen Zhou, this is a military matter and cannot be stated clearly. Li Ci (Shi Jia) returned to Beijing last night. Now that Fuzhou is about to fall, it is not yet decided whether I will personally go to coordinate. In short, Commander Li is responsible for Ma Jiang, and Commander Chen coordinates Sandu, so there is no need for me to go again. Moreover, the Central Government needs someone to negotiate and arrange matters. If I go again, there will be relatively no one to preside over the capital. The position of the principal of the Mawei Naval Academy has been vacant since Du Xigui passed away, and a successor has not yet been determined. Rumors that I am seeking the opinion of Minister Yang (Shuzhuang) are unfounded. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to strengthen Sino-Italian relations, has agreed to allow Chinese naval students to go to Italy for internships. The Central Government is already starting to select candidates, with a quota of six students. The selection is under consideration, and it should be completed around January or February, and then the date of departure will be set."</p>
<p>Shipyard Business</p>
<p>When asked about the situation of the Jiangnan Shipyard last year, Chen replied, "The Jiangnan Shipyard has always had good business, but Director Ma (Deji) incurred a loss of more than 1.8 million yuan during his tenure the year before last. Although this includes the cost of repairing various ships for the Navy, the loss is too great, and the vitality has been greatly damaged. There was no question of profit during the January 28th Incident the year before last. Although there was a slight profit last year, about 100,000 yuan, it was only enough to pay off old debts. The Navy repairs small ships at Jiangnan, averaging about 600,000 yuan per year. Under the current national economic situation, it is impossible to revitalize it even if we want to. It is fortunate that it is not losing money. The 22nd-year report is already being prepared, and it will take about a month to complete. This is a routine matter every year."</p>
<p>New Dock Project</p>
<p>Finally, Chen said, "The construction of the new dock will be completed by the end of May this year. The total cost of the dock is 1 million yuan. The construction and launching of the Pinghai warship are difficult to predict, and the reason is nothing more than funding issues. In the future, the Navy has a continuing plan to build warships, but unfortunately, funds are exhausted, and empty talk is still useless. We can only complete one part and then do another part. I came here this time because Deputy Director Chen (Zaofan) went to Hankou to discuss shipyard affairs, so I came to take care of routine official business on his behalf. Deputy Director Chen will probably return to Shanghai within two or three days. The Naval Aviation Office has no hope of expansion in the near future. There was a proposal to increase funding, but it was stopped due to the lack of funds. After my business is completed, I will return to Nanjing tomorrow (today)." After the conversation, the reporter bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Steamer</p>
<p>The Yu Ji steamer was damaged at the bow, with the greatest losses. Several rooms on the bottom layer of the main and second holds were destroyed, and a lot of water seeped in. The accumulated water has long been pumped out, and the floor is covered with cement and debris such as wooden planks. However, there are still small streams seeping in through the gaps. There is a lot of accumulated water in the bottom layer.</p>
<p>Crew Members' Conversation</p>
<p>Accountant Fan of the steamer said, "The Yu Ji steamer has been sailing for more than 20 years. The route is from Yingkou to load cargo to Yantai, and after adding cargo, it goes to Xinghua, Guantou, Fuzhou, Sandu, and other ports. Then, it loads fruits such as oranges and green fruits from Fuzhou to Shanghai to unload. It usually sails very safely. This accident is really unfortunate."</p>
<p>Truth of the Accident</p>
<p>As for the truth of this accident, there are many misconceptions outside. At 12:30 AM on the 17th of last month, the ship was sailing to Donggua Deng Mountain on the Wenzhou sea. All the passengers and crew members were asleep. I (Fan referring to himself) was also in a dream when I suddenly heard my colleagues shouting loudly. Only then did I realize that the captain, due to the darkness of the night and a slight negligence, mistakenly hit a reef. The bow of the ship was severely damaged, and everyone on board was in a state of panic. Fortunately, the ship was near Donggua Deng Mountain, so it immediately docked by the mountainside. On the one hand, the passengers and crew members were rescued to the mountain to avoid disaster, and on the other hand, an emergency telegram was sent for help. Soon, the French steamer Frik Russ heard the alarm and came to the rescue."</p>
<p>Accurate Amount of Losses</p>
<p>"After the ship accident, the cost of towing and docking repairs, together with the company's business losses, is estimated to be about 30,000 yuan. Fruits were the most of the cargo and passenger loss, totaling more than 10,000 pieces. The exact amount of the loss can be known only after unloading. However, about 70% of the fruits were placed in the front hold. After the accident, they were completely submerged in the sea. Most of those placed in the rear hold have already rotted, so the number is also huge. The exact amount of the total loss must be at least 120,000 yuan. However, the company has taken out a peace insurance policy of 120,000 yuan with the Lianbao Fire and Water Insurance Company (the previous report of 120,000 taels is inaccurate), which is sufficient to offset the loss."</p>
<p>Entering the Dock Today</p>
<p>Fan also told the Datong News Agency reporter that the ship will enter the Dongjiadu Old Ship Dock for repairs at 2:00 PM today, which will take about three weeks to complete.</p>
<h3>The Rent Reduction Movement Association Holds Its First Meeting Today</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Discussion on the Direction of Association Affairs</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city believes that the city's economic situation is sluggish, business is declining, and the city's rents are still expensive, which has a great impact on the livelihoods of the citizens. In order to remedy this situation, it held its seventh executive committee meeting the day before yesterday and decided to organize a Rent Reduction Movement Committee, and nominated Ye Jiaxing, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yiao, Cao Zhigong, Yu Zhongxian, Chen Jiufeng, Cai Qiajun, Liu Zhongying, Zhou Fuzhang, and other nine people as preparatory committee members, and contacted various legal entities to carry out the movement together. It is learned that the association is scheduled to hold its first preparatory meeting at 2:00 PM today in the meeting room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss ways to carry out the rent reduction movement in order to ease the burden on citizens and stabilize the social economy.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Requires Its Affiliated Agencies to Regularly Use the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed its affiliated agencies, "In order to comply with the matter, regarding the matter of changing to the new system of weights and measures, the Ministry of Industry has repeatedly issued orders, stating that if government agencies do not take the lead in implementing this new system, the people will be even more hesitant. Please instruct all affiliated agencies to implement it uniformly as an example and promote it. The reasons are quite justified and should be prepared within a time limit to facilitate implementation and unify the standards. It is hereby decided that the preparation period for all agencies affiliated with the Ministry shall be one month, and from August 1st of last year to the end of the year, all agencies must expedite the preparation of matters such as replacing new system equipment and compiling conversion rates, and implement the new system of weights and measures uniformly from February 1st of the 23rd year. There shall be no delay. This order is hereby issued to all affiliated agencies for compliance."</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhichao of the East China National Salvation Army Telegraphed the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Fighting the Enemy Hard in the Frozen Land</p>
<p>Hoping that the People of the Country Will Provide Support Quickly</p>
<p>Zhang Zhichao, the commander-in-chief of the East China People's National Salvation Army, on December 18th of last year, specially sent Wang Mengyu, a counselor, to present his white silk book telegram to Zhu Ziqiao, Chu Huiseng, Du Yuesheng, and others, detouring through Dalian to Shanghai to pay a visit to Zhang Zhendong, the representative stationed in Shanghai, to report on the isolated army's hard fight and the circumstances of successively recovering Dongxing, Xiji, and Duiqingshan Station. The Far East News Agency reporter visited Representative Zhang at his residence yesterday and was shown the silk book telegram of Commander-in-Chief Zhang. The original text is recorded below: Generals Zhu Ziqiao, Zhu Huilao, Wu Shanlao, Mr. Du Yuesheng, various legal entities, and newspaper offices in Shanghai, Jian Zhichao, and others were originally supported and led by the generals and vowed to resist Japan to the death. Now the generals suddenly shirk their responsibility and abandon the isolated army after being damaged by others. What else can Zhichao and others do? However, the generals are one of the most trusted people by the people of the country and shoulder the important task of saving the country. How can they abandon the work of saving the country because of small things? The people of the Northeast are all in deep water and eagerly look forward to the generals' rescue. Without the generals, there is no one to trust. On behalf of the 30 million people in the Northeast and hundreds of thousands of hard-fighting righteous armies, I respectfully express my condolences and earnestly request that you continue to provide support immediately so that Zhichao and others can continue to fight the Japanese pirates to the death. Otherwise, the isolated army will be helpless and will eventually fail. A special telegram is requested and a telegram is sent to the people of the country to unite in support so that the Northeast will have a day of recovery and the 30 million people will have hope of getting out of suffering. The war situation of the past few months is briefly presented on the left. Please review and verify it. Zhichao left Jibian on September 1st and arrived in Jiangjie to attack in conjunction with Wang Zhenqi's army. It turned out that each county of Jibian had already been recovered by Zhichao's army, but it was envied by a certain army, which led to the propaganda of Zhichao's death in battle in order to incorporate our army. Just because Chao specially sent Zhang Zhendong, the chief of staff, to the south to report, they were afraid of leaking their secrets, so they sent someone to steal Zhang Zhendong's photo and reported it to the Harbin intelligence agency, offering a reward for his arrest. It is indeed a hateful thing. After Zhichao arrived at the Jiangbian, the army's appearance was quite embarrassing. After several days of reorganization, they fought fiercely in Tonghe in the hinterland in less than two months, recovering Mulan, killing the Japanese Councillor Jiulongquan. Afterwards, they contacted the popular uprising and righteous army and seized the two gunboats Yinxiang and Daheihe at Sanchahe. When they were on the radio station of the warship, they sent out a very long telegram. I don't know if it can be reached. Recently, they have successively recovered Dongxing County, Xiji Factory, and Duiqingshan Station. All of them withdrew because they could not stand the aircraft explosions, but the military supplies were slightly replenished. All the details have been sent to the representative stationed in Shanghai one after another. I will not go into details here. What is worrying is the clothing and medicine. If they are not purchased and prepared immediately, it will be too cold to go out. How can we fight? In the past two months, there has been a war almost every day, resulting in more than 2,000 wounded soldiers, but there are no medicines at all. The moaning and crying are unbearable to hear. My general has always been doing charity. I urge all parties to provide relief as soon as possible. I am afraid that it will be too late to save. The Japanese puppet plan to eliminate the righteous army before the Lunar New Year, but I have a considerable response. I will take the strategy of guerrilla warfare, breaking the whole into parts and disturbing the two routes of the Middle East and Huling, as well as the upper and lower reaches of the Songhua River and Nen River. Each county is frightened several times a day, so that the Japanese and puppet forces are exhausted. On the 1st of the month, the Japanese and puppet forces attempted to attack my base of Daqingshan and Jiguan Mountain Lanzi. First, they used aircraft reconnaissance, followed by a large-scale siege. My army responded calmly. In no time, more than 100 Japanese and puppet forces were killed, but they still did not know where the bullets were fired from. My mountain defense is tight, and a defense card is set up every two miles. Each card has 30 soldiers. When the enemy comes, they are allowed to move forward. When they have advanced to a dozen cards, then the attack begins. Taking the encirclement, gunshots rang out, causing the enemy to fall into a maze. The Japanese and puppet forces in this battle totaled more than 700 people. No one survived, and their reinforcements did not dare to go deep. However, the Japanese army is also cunning. Whenever it encounters a dense forest, it explores forward with artillery, but it does not hurt me at all, only a few trees are hurt. If I did not occupy this danger, I would have been eliminated by the Japanese puppets. Therefore, I hope that the people of the country will provide support as soon as possible so that the Northeast can be recovered as soon as possible, otherwise, the country will perish sooner or later. I hereby urge you to wait for orders with utmost urgency. Sincerely presented by Zhang Zhichao, Commander-in-Chief of the East China People's National Salvation Army, Deputy Commanders Wang Zhenqi and Wang Zhenfang, leading all officers and soldiers, December 17th.</p>
<h3>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee Approved the Loan of the Guangdong River Control Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Contract Will Be Brought Back to Guangdong for Signature by Representatives Within Days</p>
<p>The current loan is 400,000 yuan, and the material loan is 5,000 pounds of English gold. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee held a technical and financial committee meeting in Shanghai yesterday. The financial committee met separately on the previous two days. The attendees included Zeng Rongfu, Chen Qicai, Ma Xier, and others. The technical committee attendees included Yan Deqing, Kang Deli, Zeng Yangfu, and others. Both committees discussed the loan that the Guangdong River Control Association had previously requested from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to repair the Jindong, Jinxi, and Jiyuan of the West River. The board of directors meeting in December of last year resolved that after the technical and financial committees had reviewed and approved it, the contract would be signed. It is learned that the financial committee of the association had already met on the 4th to discuss the matter and considered that the guarantees of the Guangzhou Municipal Bank and the Guangdong Provincial Bank were still reliable and should be approved. Yesterday, the technical committee convened another meeting in Shanghai to review the project plan and the bill of materials. They have now separately reported to the board of directors meeting. It is said that the loan contract will be brought back to Guangdong for signature by the representatives of the Guangdong River Control Association within days. The amount of the loan is 400,000 yuan in cash and 5,000 pounds of English gold for materials.</p>

<h3>Tan Yunshan Offers Condolences to the Dalai Lama</h3>
<p>Professor Tan Yunshan of the Indian International University is quite knowledgeable about Tibetan affairs and has friendships with officials below the Dalai Lama in Tibet. He is very saddened by the passing of the Dalai Lama. Yesterday, he specially sent a letter to Gongque Zhongni, the Dalai Lama's representative, and Abang, the Tibetan legislator, to express his condolences. The condolence letter is recorded below: Director Gongque, Committee Member Abang, and Respected Representatives, recently, I read the newspaper and was shocked to learn of the passing of the Buddha, and my grief is beyond description. The Buddha was the leader of the national religion and the master of a generation, with both blessings and wisdom, and complete integration of reason and affairs. For the past twenty years, he has been suppressing the western border, protecting the territory, promoting welfare and benefiting the people, and protecting the country and the people, making the local area peaceful and making the neighboring countries submit with awe. He has made great contributions to the country and Tibet. However, in the face of the current national crisis and the seriousness of the border defense, the great star suddenly set in the west, and the lamp of wisdom was extinguished. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. Fortunately, the Buddhist sect has many lives of wisdom, and the Tibetan government is rich in Vajras. The ambition to continue the cause will not be surpassed, which is comforting. Yunshan followed Elder Xie to cross the snowy mountains years ago and had the honor to see the Buddha's face and receive courtesy, which was a very special experience and deepened my grief. Therefore, in addition to silently praying for a few minutes every morning for three weeks to commemorate him, I hereby send this letter, respectfully requesting that it be presented to the Buddha's spirit to express my condolences. I hope that all of you and the great virtues of the Tibetan government will control your grief for the country, uphold loyalty and governance, unite sincerely, and overcome the difficulties together. I cannot help but hope and pray. Tan Yunshan bows respectfully, December 26th, the 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Investigates and Prohibits the Private Sale of Scrap Copper and Iron</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, believes that recently a certain country has secretly hired a large number of traitors, providing them with huge sums of money, and sending them to various cities and villages to buy scrap copper and iron and old metal at high prices. However, the general ignorant farmers are competing to sell agricultural tools or coins, which is not in line with the spirit of common hatred and unity against the enemy during the national crisis. Moreover, this type of prohibition on sales has been formulated into four measures by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs in June of last year and issued to all. It is heard that Mayor Wu, in order to prevent a certain party from buying scrap copper, iron, and other metals, specially instructed Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to order all districts to comply with the investigation and prohibition.</p>

The original text reads, "Respectfully to Mrs. Wu Tiyun in Hong Kong, the passing away of Brother Tiyun comes at a time when the country is facing many difficulties, and the homeland needs talent.

<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Chongbao Relief Society for the Qishui Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>The Chongbao Relief Society for the Qishui Flood Disaster in Southern Sichuan held its eleventh standing committee meeting at Renji Hall the day before yesterday. Twenty-one people attended, including Wang Yiting, Zhang Bochou, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Du Yuesheng, Lu Caifu, Gu Nanqun, and Pan Zhiwen. Wang Yiting chaired the meeting, and Huang Hanzhi served as the recorder. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Items for Report ㈠ The society distributed cotton-padded clothing to the disaster victims of Jiangxinsha. Ji Xingjie received 190 sets and transported them for inspection and distribution on December 30. ㈠ Regarding the society's allocation of relief rice to Fengxian, it was decided by the third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to allocate 3,000 yuan. The procurement team has now purchased 500 bags of relief rice. The amount exceeding 3,000 yuan will be covered by Mr. Cheng Weiyu. ㈠ Previously, the society received a report from Zhang Weiren and others in Qidong, suggesting that the authorities should take the opportunity of the construction and repair of dikes during this work relief project to compensate for losses by adjusting the shoreline slightly eastward in areas of collapse and accretion. This would create more than two million steps of uncultivated land, which could be cultivated by the tenant farmers from the collapsed areas. After forwarding this to the Qidong office for impartial review, the reply stated that the tenant farmers had no harvest and might not have the resources to relocate. If Zhang Weiren and others had a plan to reduce dike construction and open up more land, it would benefit the landowners, and as long as it did not hinder the principle of disaster relief, it would be greatly supported. They requested that this information be conveyed to all concerned. ㈠ As of today, according to the twenty-first announcement of thanks, the society has received a total of 129,989 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen in donations, as well as government bonds with a face value of 80 yuan (including 20 yuan for Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bonds and Industrial Securities, and 50 yuan for Continued 2-5 Treasury Bonds).</p>
<p>Items for Discussion ㈠ The Chongming office sent a letter requesting that Huang Lichuan be dispatched to receive 1,300 bags of relief rice. The letter was signed by Wang Dan Kui, the director of the office, but it was not sealed. The society had previously received a letter from Vice Chairman Wang, stating that he had not approved the director of the county office. Should the rice be issued as requested? It was decided to allocate the rice as requested, with Wang Caifu, a member of the society, responsible for the matter. ㈠ Ten disaster victims from the Second District of Nanhui, including Longjiang Lang, sent a letter requesting that the county magistrate be promptly consulted to establish a work relief sub-office in the Second District to expedite construction. This case had been repeatedly requested by the disaster victims, and the wording was very sincere, indicating that the matter was urgent. Before the inspection team's report was completed, how should this be handled? It was decided that disaster relief should be provided without discrimination, treating everyone equally. The work relief in the Second District of Nanhui should not be delayed, and a letter should be sent to the Nanhui County Magistrate to promptly investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Plans to Establish Municipal Epidemic Prevention Hospital</h3>
<p>Taking Over Public Hospitals After Rectification</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Patients with Epidemic Diseases from Indiscriminately Seeking Treatment at Other Hospitals</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the fact that during epidemics, patients indiscriminately seek treatment at various hospitals, which not only hinders treatment but also easily leads to the spread of the disease through inadvertent contact, constantly causing those who seek to prevent the disease to catch it, and those who spread the disease to transmit it further. The bureau felt that the city lacked specialized epidemic prevention hospital facilities, with only one private epidemic prevention hospital in Zhabei. The municipal government had not established such a facility. This situation was deemed to be of great importance to the health and safety of the citizens. Therefore, at the end of last year, the bureau actively prepared to establish a municipal epidemic prevention hospital in Zhabei, using the site of the Chinese Public Hospital. The takeover was completed on December 28 of last year, and repairs and renovations have begun. The hospital has over 200 wards and can accommodate over 300 patients. Once completed, specialized physicians will be assigned to manage the hospital. The bureau also plans to issue a notice to all parties, strictly prohibiting patients with epidemic diseases from indiscriminately seeking treatment at other hospitals, and requesting other hospitals to assist in reducing the spread of contagious diseases.</p>
<h3>Master of Martial Arts Sun Lutang Passes Away</h3>
<p>Sun Lutang, a native of Wan County, Hebei, was proficient in Xingyi, Bagua, and Taiji inner-family martial arts. He also enjoyed studying outer-family martial arts and could perform various styles of outer-family boxing, swordsmanship, spear techniques, and other weapons, totaling over a hundred different types. He seemed to have a natural talent for martial arts, and his reputation resonated throughout the country. He was also proficient in the Book of Changes and Qimen Dunjia, and had a broad understanding of Taoist studies. He was truly an extraordinary man of his time. It has been learned that Mr. Sun passed away unexpectedly on December 15 of last year. Mr. Sun was originally from Beiping and had no illnesses. He suddenly wanted to return to Wan County and passed away without any serious illness. Three years ago, when he was in Shanghai, he told his disciples that his three years of merit would be complete, and he could leave. Those who heard this did not fully understand his meaning. Counting the days, it was exactly three years. Could Mr. Sun have known in advance? He was 75 years old. His disciples Chen Weiming of the Zhi Rou Boxing Society and Zhi Xie Tang of the Railway Bureau, upon hearing of their master's passing, plan to initiate a memorial service to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Wireless Expert Tan Liang Returns to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Wireless expert Tan Liang's trip to the United States has been temporarily postponed. He recently met with wireless inventor Marconi and gained many insights.

<h3>Ninghai Fellow Villagers Association Petitions for Strict Investigation After Robbery of Xiangning Steamer</h3>
<p>The Ninghai Fellow Villagers Association held its third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday. Over twenty committee members attended, including Ying Yeping, Hu Dingchu, Yan Cangshan, and Guo Yongxi. Yan Cangshan chaired the meeting. The agenda included: ㈠ Finding ways to assist fellow villagers He Zheng Neng, Zhang Jiao Jing, Chen Yu Qing, Ye Qin, etc., who have requested relief. ㈡ Appointing Ye Yunfeng as a consulting physician. ㈢ Appointing Mao Yun, Xu Yin Keng, and Jiang Zong Pan as legal advisors. ㈣ Sending a telegram of congratulations to fellow villager Dao Ying for being appointed Commander of the Second Column of the Western Route of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Army. ㈤ Petitioning the Provincial Government for a strict investigation into the robbery of the Xiangning steamer, which was traveling from Ninghai to Yong. The petition is as follows: Petition for strict investigation into the robbery of a merchant ship, which endangered passengers, in order to ensure the safety of travelers. It is reported that the Xiangning steamer, which travels between Ningbo and Xiangshan Ninghai, departed from Ninghai at 9:00 a.m. on the 31st of last month with over a hundred passengers. At 2:00 p.m., it was robbed by over ten bandits on horseback at Sanjiao in Xiangshan Port. The bandits fled in five small boats at Baidai Men Strait on the first day, and kidnapped accountant Gu Wenbing and passengers Lu Ziliang, etc., over twenty people. Passenger He Chenglin was killed, and Wang A Gen was seriously injured. One sailor was also injured. The passengers lost 6,000 yuan, and the steamer company lost 300 yuan. Upon reading this, we were extremely shocked. With the end of the lunar year approaching, this route is crucial for merchants and travelers to transport goods and remit funds. However, the bandits blatantly took the opportunity to rob, even kidnapping and killing people. This is a blatant disregard for the law. If the matter is not strictly investigated to suppress this rampant behavior, others will follow suit, and not only will travelers be discouraged from traveling, but the business of the county will be greatly affected. Our association cares about our homeland and our fellow villagers, and we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we petition your government to order a strict investigation and set a time limit to apprehend the bandits in order to quell the banditry and ensure the safety of travelers. This would be a great service. Respectfully submitted to Lu, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, by the Shanghai Ninghai Fellow Villagers Association.</p>

<h3>Re-election of the Woolen Mill Industry Association</h3>
<p>Lu Wenshao and Others Elected as Executive Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Mill Industry Association held an election meeting yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from Shengda, Tongyi, Hongfa, Aiguo, Maoye, Shenchang, Xinli, Dade, Jinglun, Daxing, Dada, Maoxin, Dalong, Lanhua, Zhenye, and other factories, including Jiang Zongshui and Li Xingyue, attended. Lu Wenshao, Chen Xianben, and Jiang Zongshui were publicly elected as the presidium. After the opening ceremony, Chairman Lu Wenshao reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Chen Xianben, who reported on the reorganization of the association. He stated that the association was originally named the Shanghai Chinese Woolen Mill Industry Association. Due to the unsound organization, seventeen factories in the city jointly petitioned the Municipal Party Department for reorganization. The Party Department issued order No. 1084, ordering the previous association to cease its activities and assigning personnel to reorganize it, appointing Lu Wenshao, Jiang Zongshui, Chen Xianben, Lin Ganchen, Jiang Fuchen, Fan Lianxiang, Yu Jietang, and others as reorganization committee members. The committee members held repeated meetings and contacted the responsible personnel of the previous association to transfer the matters. However, the personnel of the previous association stubbornly refused to hand over the matters. Therefore, the registration of members was urgently carried out. Currently, the registered members have exceeded two-thirds of the industry in the city, so the election is being carried out. As for the advertisement published in today's newspaper in the name of the Shanghai Woolen Mill Industry Association denying the convening of the election meeting, it is very puzzling. The association will petition the higher authorities to investigate thoroughly, etc. Next, Xie Jinan, Yuan Hongjun, and other representatives from the party and government organs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches. The election was then held. As a result, Qiu Xinyi, Yao Peirong, Wu Yuanmao, and others were elected as supervisors, with Xie Zhongle as an alternate. Lu Wenshao, Chen Xianben, Li Chuancai, Jiang Fuchen, Ke Ganchen, Jiang Zongshui, Yu Jietang, Fan Lianxiang, Huang Pinliang, Jin Shaoyu, and Li Xingyue were elected as executive committee members, with Zhao Anxiang and Xia Juehou as alternates. The meeting concluded with a group photo.</p>
<h3>Murderer Who Killed Rickshaw Puller Three Years Ago Arrested</h3>
<p>=Poisonous Hands Due to Competition for Business=</p>
<p>=Both Murderers Have Directly Admitted Everything=</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller Wang Guitao from Yangzhou was involved in a dispute with two fellow rickshaw pullers over taking a Westerner as a passenger at noon on July 22nd of the 20th year of the Republic [1931] near Broadway and Dent Road. He was beaten and seriously injured, falling to the ground. A patrolling policeman saw this and sent him to Tongren Hospital, where he died at 3:45 p.m. The case had been unsolved for nearly three years, and the police had been unable to apprehend the suspects. The day before yesterday, an informant, Chen Jinsheng, reported that the two murderers, Li Fuqian and Yang Wenxin (both from Yangzhou), were now pulling rickshaws in the Broadway and Hualu Ji Road area. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Li and Yang and detain them in the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that according to informant Chen Jinsheng, who was present at the scene, a Westerner named Chunker came out of a saloon and hailed a rickshaw. The deceased and the two defendants rushed forward to solicit the fare. The deceased managed to get the passenger, which angered Li Fuqian, who beat him to the ground. Yang Wenxin also assisted in the assault. Li finally used his feet to stomp on the deceased's head, causing a head injury. Afterwards, the victim stated in the hospital that one of the murderers was Li Fuqian, and he did not know the other person before he died. Later, the police found that the rickshaw pulled by the murderer was number 3530, which was released by the Yangshupu number 1324 rickshaw company. The rickshaw puller's name was Ni Fuji, which was similar to Li Fuqian's name. Both defendants confessed to the crime at the police station. However, informant Chen Jinsheng did not arrive today, etc. Judge Ji Xie Fen questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation with witnesses.</p>
<h3>Qian Chengjun Transferred to Wuxi Court as President</h3>
<p>Qian Chengjun, the Chief of the Criminal Court of the Shanghai District Court, is a member of the prominent Qian family of Jiashan. He is highly knowledgeable, handles cases quickly, and is known for his integrity and benevolence. Therefore, he personally investigates and interrogates all difficult and major cases. Whenever there are doubts about a case, he always seeks details and personally investigates, without relying on others. Therefore, no matter what case Qian handles, it is always resolved easily. In the past six or seven years, he has never wrongly acquitted anyone. Therefore, he is praised by the people as a rare talent among modern judicial officials. The current President Shen Xiqing is also a capable man of modern times, and he relies heavily on Qian. Now, Qian has been promoted by the Judicial Administration Department for his outstanding achievements. The Wuxi County Court is being expanded into a District Court, so Qian has been specially appointed as the President of the Wuxi Court. This has been announced in the department's order, but he has not yet arrived. Therefore, Qian is currently handling the cases he is responsible for to a conclusion before taking up his new post.</p>
<h3>Zhang Aina's Case Against Xu Jiashi</h3>
<p>=Appeal Rejected Again=</p>
<p>=Xu Jiashi Still Not Guilty=</p>
<p>Zhang Aina, a dancer at the Lafayette Garden Dance Hall, had a love affair with Xu Jiashi, a young Cantonese man and student at Nanyang Commercial High School residing at 39 Ruihua Lane, Route Lafayette, French Concession. They went to a hotel and had sexual relations. Xu personally wrote a statement promising never to abandon her and to marry her at a later date. If he were to break his promise and abandon her, he would be willing to pay several thousand yuan in damages. He gave this statement to Zhang. From then on, the two often went in and out of dance halls and hotels together, appearing to be a young couple, which many people envied. However, good times do not last. Recently, Xu had another love interest and abandoned Zhang. Zhang repeatedly searched for him, but Xu avoided meeting her. Helpless, Zhang's mother, Zhang Wang, acting as her legal guardian, hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, accusing Xu Jiashi of seduction and abandonment, requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law, and seeking compensation for damages. The court held a hearing, and Xu Jiashi was defended by lawyer E Shen. The result was that the defendant was found not guilty. The plaintiffs, Zhang Wang and Zhang Aina, expressed dissatisfaction with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court accepted the case and held a collegial panel hearing on December 26 of last year. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Because the case involved morality, the court ordered that the public be prohibited from attending the hearing. Both parties were still represented by lawyers Chen Jiaocan and E Shen. The case has now been concluded and the judgment has been announced. The appellant's appeal was rejected. It is said that the reason for the judgment was that Zhang Aina entered into a relationship with Xu Jiashi willingly, without any coercion or force. Furthermore, she often returned home to live with her mother, which shows that there was no abduction or separation from the person with parental rights.</p>
<h3>Wu Shaozhang Commits Suicide by Taking Tranquilizer Pills</h3>
<p>Wu Shaozhang, also known as Gen Sheng, a native of Dongting Mountain, was 37 years old and lived at 22 Beigaoshou Lane, Aierjin Road. It is said that he used to work at HSBC Bank, but was recently dismissed a month ago for some reason. He had been suffering from mental illness and had attempted suicide several times without success. Afterwards, his family watched him and did not allow him to go out. However, the night before last, he secretly went to the Great Shanghai Hotel in Xiangfen Lane, booked room 324, and swallowed tranquilizer pills when no one was watching.

<h3>Machine Industry Association Establishes National Goods Tea Party Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association feels that its member organizations rarely have the opportunity to meet throughout the year, leading to isolation among colleagues.

The purpose is to provide member factories with more opportunities to meet, discuss improvements to the industry, and increase the welfare of colleagues. In the event of special events, temporary meetings can also be convened for consultation. The opening will be held today, with hours from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. West Lake Tiger Spring water will be brought in, along with high-quality Longjing tea leaves, to enhance the enjoyment.

<p>Tax Evasion on Japanese Headless Light Bulbs - Electrical Industry Association Alerts the Ministry of Electricity</p>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Seek Profit and Disregard the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Japanese Cunning and Deception Abound</p>
<p>The "New Voice News" reports that the dumping of Japanese light bulbs has attracted the attention of countries around the world. The Chinese government, in order to protect domestic products, has specially increased the import tax on light bulbs to compensate for this. Unexpectedly, recently, in order to avoid heavy taxes, the Japanese have imported light bulbs without copper heads as raw materials, installed copper heads in Shanghai, and colluded with unscrupulous merchants to peddle them everywhere, disrupting the market. The Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association of this city, in addition to trying to deal severely with unscrupulous merchants, has specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, the text of which is as follows: "Respected Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Respected Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Japanese light bulbs are being dumped everywhere at reduced prices, which is a great blow to our country's light bulb manufacturing factories. Fortunately, your ministries have increased tariffs, increasing their costs. This is a good way to maintain domestic light bulb factories. However, the cunning Japanese are colluding with unscrupulous merchants to import light bulbs without copper heads, passing them off as raw materials to avoid heavy taxes. Recently, they have imported large quantities, disrupting the market and bringing domestic light bulbs to the brink of extinction. The tariff barrier built by your ministries with great effort has also been completely defeated. If we do not quickly find a way to deal with this, the situation will become a prairie fire. I am deeply worried and dare not remain silent. I hereby telegraphically report, requesting your examination and implementation of instructing customs to tax headless light bulbs as light bulbs. This would be a great service. Respectfully, Hu Xiyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Sudden Sealing of the Su-Shen Eyeglasses Cooperative by the Landlord</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Claims to be Acting on the Landlord's Request</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Members Are Evicted and Displaced</p>
<p>The "New Voice News" reports that the Su-Shen Eyeglass Frame Production Cooperative on West Shixing Road and Yu Port Road in Zhabei has more than 400 members. Recently, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Eyeglass Frame Production Cooperative by order of the Bureau of Social Affairs. Therefore, while the cooperative was being reorganized, some members were recently laid off and sent back, waiting to rejoin the cooperative when the spring came and the founding meeting was held. There are currently only a hundred or so people left. At 1:00 PM on the fifth, Chen Guansheng, the manager of the Chen Guanji accounting firm, suddenly ordered the rent collector Yang Qingru to lead a police officer to seal off the cooperative, causing great disorder. The members of the cooperative, in addition to hiring lawyer Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit according to the law, also decided to submit petitions to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the General Labor Union, and various legal organizations to request assistance. The details obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Case Involved for Several Months</p>
<p>The cooperative's houses, numbering fifteen, are rented from Hongmou Company and managed by the Chen Guanji accounting firm. Previously, due to issues such as rent payment and relocation, they filed lawsuits against each other in the local court. The court rejected Chen Guanji's lawsuit for relocation. As for the rent payment, it was settled in court. The presiding judge instructed Chen Guanji to repair the houses completely within half a month, and the rent would be paid after the work was completed. However, the repairs have not been carried out, so the rent has not been paid.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sealed Off</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the fifth, four police officers from the No. 8 Bridge Police Station of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, together with rent collector Yang Qingru and others, went to the cooperative's office and completely expelled more than ten members and trainees. Two police officers</p>
<h3>Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai Hears Evidence in Coffin Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>==Eight Witnesses Recounted the Circumstances at the Time== The Portuguese Consul Announced Resumption of the Hearing Next Wednesday</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that Portuguese national José Maria de Medeiros, the defendant in the coffin case from last August, and his brother Patricio Medeiros, were sent to Macau for trial. José Maria de Medeiros was acquitted due to insufficient evidence, but his brother confessed to the murder. The defendant is still detained in Macau, and the case has not yet been finalized. Yesterday (the 6th), the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Silveira, held a public hearing at the consulate on Lafayette Road to take evidence. Eight witnesses appeared. First, a coolie from the Nippon Yusen Kaisha wharf at the Bund testified that on August 5th of last year, he saw a foreigner arrive in a rickshaw, carrying a box, and order him to carry it onto the Shanghai Maru ship. The box was very heavy, and he was rewarded with 20 cents. Next, a two-day wife, a neighbor from No. 13 Jiaxing Road, testified that on the night of August 4th, they heard a noise coming from No. 15 Jiaxing Road, and a Chinese woman screaming for help. They went to the balcony to peep into the neighboring room. Although the lights were off, they could still see two people lying on a bed. The defendant's lawyer, Mr. Langlier, then cross-examined. One of the witnesses said that she could not say for sure what she saw, but she heard a woman moaning after midnight, and the noise gradually stopped at about 1:30 AM. The two-day wife also stated that they saw two foreigners carrying a box out of No. 15 Jiaxing Road on the morning of August 5th. Next, Mrs. Zhang Hu, the owner of the house at Nos. 15-17 Jiaxing Road, testified that on July 26th of last year, the defendant rented a room in her house with a Chinese woman. On August 3rd, she saw the two of them fighting in front of her room. The next night, she saw the two of them returning with another foreigner, who, they said, was the defendant's brother. Soon, this person took away the two dogs they kept. The Chinese woman was well-dressed and had wavy hair. She did not suspect anything at first, until she was awakened by a scream around midnight. Her room was connected to the defendant's room, so she immediately asked them to stop making noise. The defendant replied that they would not make any more noise, and the noise stopped. The next morning, the defendant left the room, saying that the woman had gone back to her mother's house because of the quarrel. Around noon that day, the defendant and his brother carried a huge box together, and then took the box away in a cab. Next, Mr. Billina, from No. 22 Jiaxing Road, opposite the defendant's room, testified that on the night of August 4th, he saw a person in the room on the top floor of No. 15 hitting a woman on the balcony. The woman fell to the side of the wall, and the lights in the room went out. Mr. Billina then answered the cross-examination of the defendant's lawyer, Mr. Langlier, stating that when the defendant hit the woman, the two windows of the opposite room were not closed, and the lights were very bright, so he could see it. The woman did not fight back. At this point, the Portuguese Consul-General announced that the hearing would be adjourned to next Wednesday.</p>
<p>First returned, and the other two police officers helped Yang and others to evict all the members of the cooperative. More than a hundred workers and apprentices in the cooperative were all driven out of the gate. The evicted people, with no place to eat or sleep in the cold weather, pleaded for accommodation. As a result, they were only allowed to take out their bedding. At that time, the ground was scattered in chaos, with cries of sorrow, a very miserable scene. Then, Yang and others ordered A Er, the person in charge of the alley, to use an axe to remove all the door locks, and then nailed up all the front and back doors, windows, dormitories, and dining halls. Ge Jinliang, the director of the cooperative, rushed back upon hearing the news and immediately submitted a letter to the No. 8 Bridge Police Station. According to Officer Li of that station, it was at the request of Chen Guanji.</p>
<p>Request for Relief</p>
<p>The cooperative believes that people have the freedom to reside and conduct business, and no one should interfere without legal basis. Now, without a court order, the police station is acting on Chen Guanji's request, sending police to illegally seal off the cooperative. The procedure seems to be inappropriate. They have hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit according to the law. It is also reported that the cooperative, due to the displacement of members and the suspension of business, has submitted petitions to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the General Labor Union, and other legal organizations to request assistance and advocate for fairness.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Snowfall in the City</h3>
<p>—A Great Benefit to Agriculture—</p>
<p>—Also Not Insignificant in Eliminating Epidemics—</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, there has been a long drought without rain in this port. The weather has been dry and hot, as if it were spring. Therefore, many people outside have been suffering from throat problems. Since the 3rd, the weather has suddenly changed, with north winds blowing in and breath turning to clouds. At 7:00 PM yesterday, it suddenly snowed. However, due to the excessive amount of water, it did not accumulate. It had not stopped by 3:00 AM this morning. Although the snowfall was not strong, it has been of great benefit to agriculture and the people.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Ships Congested in Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Very Difficult to Clear</p>
<p>Due to the recent small tide in the Suzhou Creek within this port, coupled with the large number of ships entering and leaving, there is often a risk of congestion. Around 5:00 PM the night before last, when the tide was rising, many wooden boats were eager to take advantage of the tide to enter the river, following one after another. However, at this time, boats coming out of the inner river from the previous low tide, not yet having reached the Huangpu River, were also constantly sailing downstream, causing the entering and exiting boats to gradually squeeze together. Although the customs water police station and the Chinese police at the scene tried their best to direct and coordinate, the boats entering and exiting encountered obstacles, and the boats behind kept coming, so the directors, even though they shouted themselves hoarse, were ineffective. It is estimated that the congestion started from the Megan Road Bridge in the west. As the boats entering the river gathered in greater numbers, within two hours, they had squeezed to the Zhejiang Road Bridge in the east, extending for about a mile, completely blocked and unable to move forward or backward. At that time, the No. 495 sampan ridden by Chinese Police No. 15 of the water police station was also squeezed in the middle, and the traffic in Suzhou Creek was completely cut off. Yesterday, the police station dispatched police again to direct the boats at both ends to retreat. However, there were no fewer than a thousand ships, large and small, congested, and it was difficult to clear them for a while. Passengers and cargo ships hoping to enter or exit the river were all extremely anxious, but there was nothing they could do. According to this situation, it may be difficult to clear until this morning.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was the Russian Christmas</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that today (the 7th) is the Russian Christmas. The four Russian churches in this port all performed the ceremony as usual. In the afternoon, the Russian Retired Officers Association will hold a meeting to entertain children. Russian children's schools also have this event. According to Russian religious customs, Russians fasted yesterday until the evening star appeared, and then began to eat. Then, the whole family feasted. Last night (the 6th), prayer ceremonies were also held in various churches.</p>
<h3>A Young Woman Loses Her Virginity to a Scoundrel, A Dream of Love Turns to Running About</h3>
<p>=At First, They Lived Together in Harmony, Then Wandered the World=</p>
<p>=Finally, She Never Returned, How Could This Young Woman Bear It?=</p>
<p>丨Xu Qiaozhen Cannot Bear It Any Longer and Files a Lawsuit丨</p>
<p>Xu Qiaozhen, a young woman from Wuxing, met Cheng Ziquan from Suzhou at the home of her relative Ma Chengshi in February two years ago. Ma Chengshi introduced them, and they became close. Cheng found Xu very attractive and knew that she was still a young, unmarried woman, so he used seductive methods. Xu, inexperienced in the world, was gradually captivated. From then on, they became increasingly close. Soon, under the repeated impact of the trend of independent marriage, they did not wait for the orders of their parents or the words of a matchmaker, and suddenly cohabitated with Cheng. Cheng rented a house on Niuzhuang Road and lived together, acting like a married couple. After about half a year, Cheng said that his elders were all in his hometown of Suzhou, and he had been away for too long, which worried his parents, and he was also concerned about the depletion of his funds. Therefore, he proposed to return to his hometown. When Qiaozhen arrived in Suzhou with him, Cheng did not take her home to meet his parents-in-law, but arranged for her to stay at Hengxing Candle Shop in Xianghua Bridge. Although Qiaozhen was suspicious, Cheng made all kinds of excuses. After staying there for nearly three months, Cheng wanted to go to Nanjing with her. At that time, Xu had no choice but to follow him obediently. After arriving in Nanjing, before their luggage was unpacked, they went to Tianjin along the Jinpu Railway. The travel expenses along the way were paid for by Xu's belongings. They lived in Tianjin for a month, moving between three hotels. Having nothing to do, they seemed like vagrants. However, her clothes were limited, and the needs of life were endless. Until the end of November of that year, their money was all gone, and their livelihood became increasingly difficult. In addition, they were strangers in a strange land, with no way to borrow money. They were about to be in dire straits when Cheng suddenly returned south alone, leaving Qiaozhen to endure the pain of displacement. She returned alone, first to Shanghai, searching in vain, and then went to Suzhou, but still could not find any trace of him. The belongings in the Suzhou residence were also gone. When she asked the neighbors, they all said that Cheng Ziquan had long been married. Qiaozhen then realized the dream, and with resentment returned to Shanghai. After waiting for a long time, she never saw Cheng again. She then hired lawyer Xue Jiaqi to file a criminal lawsuit against Cheng in the First Special District Local Court for fraudulent marriage, seduction, and abandonment. The complaint described the process of their relationship in detail. The final paragraph also stated that the defendant had personally written a marriage certificate at that time. Because the plaintiff did not know the law, there was no marriage ceremony, but she always recognized the defendant as her husband, so she obeyed his adultery. Judging from his actions before and after, he had committed the crime of Article 244 of the Criminal Law. Even if she wanted to forgive him, what about the morality of society? She requested that a document be sent to the Wuxian Local Court to summon the defendant to court and punish him according to the law, and that the defendant be ordered to pay 20,000 yuan in consolation money and compensation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special Court held a hearing to summon him. Because it was necessary to investigate everything, the hearing was adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>The History of Evil in the Metropolis</h3>
<p>Good Women Sold into Brothels</p>
<p>Three Cases Cracked in Three Days</p>
<p>The prevalence of licentiousness in Shanghai is greater than in other places. Places where women are used for profit are everywhere. For example, the so-called "song-selling but not body-selling" courtesan houses, the so-called social dance halls, and massage parlors, as well as places specifically for men to vent their desires, such as the Han Village Yaer Brothel, are too numerous to mention. In short, they all use women as a draw to earn money. Among these women, although there are some who voluntarily engage in this lowly profession due to economic pressure, there are also many good women who are seduced by criminals, fall into the fire pit, and never have a chance to escape, losing their reputation and happiness for life. In the past three days, the Public Concession police have successively cracked three cases of criminals inducing women to sell themselves into brothels, arresting many criminals and sending them to court for severe punishment. Details are listed below: ㈠ Hua Guibao, a 17-year-old woman from Suzhou, living at 67 Zhoushan Road, went out to work as a servant to make a living because of her poor family. Unexpectedly, although she was young, her love had blossomed. She had been in a relationship with Wu Ashuang, a neighbor, for more than seven months. Recently, the woman heard that her father had arranged another match for her, and she would choose a lucky day to marry soon. Therefore, after discussing with Ashuang, on October 23 of last year, they eloped together. They first lived at the place of Zhang Yongjin, an old man in Wu, for about two months. However, Ashuang had no permanent job, and it was difficult to afford the woman's daily living expenses. Therefore, he had bad intentions and colluded with Fan Quangen, Fan Shuilin, and Zhang and others to sell the woman to Wang Fengyun, a Jiangbei woman, and Huang Tangshi, a woman, in the Free Square No. 207 on Guangdong Road, as a prostitute. From then on, the woman fell into the fire pit. On the 4th of the month, the woman received a guest. The guest asked about her life, and the woman told him everything and begged him to find a way to rescue her. The next day, the client reported to Han Shoushan, a Chinese detective in the General Police Station. He coordinated with Li Yidong, the Chinese detective chief, and Bao Tan, Liang Shiwei, and others to rush to the scene, arrest Huang Tangshi, Fan Quangen, Wang Fengyun, Fan Shuilin, and others, and rescue Hua Guibao, bringing them to the police station. ㈡ Chen Erbao, a man from Shengze, Zhejiang, brought Jin A'er, a 17-year-old woman, Lu Afeng, and Qian Wangshi, a 22-year-old woman, three people, from Shengze on December 24 of last year, on the pretext of introducing them to Shanghai to earn a living, intending to sell them for money. On the way, Chen also raped Jin A'er and Qian Wangshi one after another. Jin, still a virgin, had no choice but to endure this abuse. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen Erbao gathered his fellow villagers Xu Xuekui, Shen Jinliang, Hang Genda, Sun Jinbao, and Xu Damao, and opened rooms in the No. 25 Tianjin Road Chinese Merchant Hotel and the Dahuah Hotel on Baliqiao Street in the French Concession to secretly discuss selling the three women. Lu Afeng had already been sold to a place in Dachang three days ago. They were planning to continue selling Jin and Qian when Wang Jiaju, the Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, Bao Tan Xie Guisheng, Wan Yuke and others found out and arrested Chen Erbao and the other six people, rescuing Jin A'er and Qian Wangshi, and detaining them separately. ㈢ The Laozha Police Station Western Police Officer Pei Er and Chinese Police Officer Xu A'jin found out that someone was running a private brothel inside No. 116 Luohai Road and went to arrest them. They arrested Yuan Chunting, a man from Shaoxing, Yuan Yingshi, Zhang Wangshi, He Yingshi, Feng Hanshi and other five people, and rescued Chen Xiao'e, Zhou A'xiang, Han Aibao, Li Guibao, Shen Zhenbao, and other prostitutes. It was found that they were all lured and forced into prostitution. They were detained separately. All three cases have been filed as public prosecutions by the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Local Court, requesting severe punishment according to law to maintain social morality. After investigation by presiding judges Qian and Feng, except for the Chen Erbao case, which has been concluded and scheduled for sentencing this Thursday, the remaining two cases were postponed for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Shengsheng:</p>
<p>I read in the news column of your esteemed newspaper on the 5th, about the dispute in our factory, in which the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting: 1. That the capitalist be ordered to resume work immediately. 2. Otherwise, severance pay should be paid according to regulations. According to the facts, in addition to requesting that the capitalist be ordered to resume work as soon as possible, the workers also requested to be paid living expenses before work resumed, and there was no request for severance pay according to regulations. I hope you will correct this. With best regards, The Provisional Committee of Workers of the Shanghai Meifeng Silk Factory, January 5th.</p>
<p>In your newspaper's news column, today, there was a news item entitled "Laughter Breaks Up Adultery Case," which stated that the adulterer, Gao Caiyun, was employed at the Wang Yutai Tea House outside the Old North Gate, etc. We were very surprised. After investigation, there is no one named Gao among our staff. The criminal is using the name of our employee, and we suspect there is another motive. We hereby send this letter to clarify, and hope that you will publish this letter. Respectfully to Mr. Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Wang Yutai Tea House, January 7th.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On "Self-Study"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhou Bingnan raised the question, "Can a person with no foundation achieve success in their studies through self-study?" We are very happy and believe this is a very valuable question, especially as our section begins to explore learning with many amateur friends. It is a crucial prerequisite with great significance.</p>
<p>Naturally, we should first dispel this doubt. We should have confidence, not only in reading but also in engaging in all other endeavors. Losing confidence only leads to depression and prevents one from generating the courage to move forward. This is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Regarding whether "self-study" can achieve success, it needs to be considered from several aspects. In terms of the nature of the subject, natural science is not suitable for self-study by those with no foundation, because the most important aspect of this subject is experimentation. Without experimentation and a suitable environment (laboratories, science museums), pursuing it solely through books is useless. Therefore, success is difficult. The same applies to "linguistics." When learning a foreign language, "speaking" is essential. Self-study can achieve success in "reading" and "writing," but without an environment for "speaking," success in "speaking" is difficult. However, literature and social sciences are different. Their material comes from the entire social life, and no matter how much you absorb, it is inexhaustible. As long as you are faithful to practice and do not distort the truth, you will unconsciously be trained in your daily life. If you add theoretical exploration or technical cultivation, you may become a writer or social scientist. In terms of the word "success," there are also several different perspectives. Many people consider "becoming famous" as success, but truly successful people do not necessarily become "famous" immediately, especially in the arts. Some people consider gaining material rewards as success, while others regard obtaining "doctoral" or "master's" degrees as success. There are also those who look down on these things and dedicate themselves to their own endeavors, preparing to "hide their achievements in famous mountains and pass them on to worthy individuals," regardless of worldly rewards. However, for us poor folks, these explanations of "success" are not what we hope for. Our attitude towards reading is not for advancement, not to become scholars, and certainly not for "achievements to be hidden in famous mountains." We are doing it for practical use, to understand real life, and how to struggle to improve our own or the public's lives. If we adopt this attitude, we can then choose one or several sciences that are close to our personality and easy to self-study. While struggling to make a living, we can learn as we go, accumulating knowledge bit by bit. Knowing a little more is "success," and this is practical knowledge that is useful to you.</p>
<p>Many people believe that reading must be done in schools. This is a misconception. While schools are indeed better places for seeking knowledge, they only provide an environment and a guide. Success in learning depends entirely on yourself. Having a travel guide is useless if you don't travel and explore in person. You are just dreaming and cannot say that you truly understand the actual situation of a place. Anyone who has achieved some success in learning has done so through self-study, mostly after leaving school, by honing their skills in books, in their own studies, and in all areas of real life, enduring hardship, and achieving success step by step. Looking at those who have succeeded in new literature in the past two decades, most of them did not study literature. Lu Xun and Guo Moruo were doctors, Zhou Zuoren studied naval affairs, Zhang Ziping studied mining, and Ding Ling did not even attend university. Yu Dafu studied political economy, and Shen Congwen is said to have been a soldier. They have all achieved considerable success now. This success is due to their own efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking of foundation, it is naturally very important. But even if the foundation is not solid, it doesn't matter, because as long as you work hard, you can gradually cultivate it yourself. Success cannot be achieved in a day. It comes little by little through hard work, and there is absolutely no shortcut.</p>
<p>Marconi said it well, "People who think that something cannot be done are not necessarily reliable. We know that what is called impossible is often because the person has not fully understood all aspects of the matter. Even if others think it is impossible and the future seems hopeless at first, we must insist on opening up new avenues of research." We should have this spirit. Our lives are too busy and too unstable. Today, we don't know what changes tomorrow's life will bring. How can we have the leisure to read? Most of your friends probably feel this way, but this is the most unprogressive thinking. Living in today's world, it is impossible to live peacefully. If life is too good, perhaps you are satisfied with everything and have no desire to read. It is an illusion to wait for life to stabilize before seeking knowledge. Only by disregarding failure, even knowing that it is impossible, can we still "do it," and thus achieve final victory.</p>
<p>In short, the above is a simple answer to the question you raised. I don't know if it can dispel your doubts. Our library's reading guidance is based on the above beliefs. We are now preparing to share our own self-study experiences with amateur friends, working together on our respective efforts. Success still depends on you, and it must be obtained through "self-study." Respectfully,</p>

<h3>Speech at the Tea Party for Representatives of the National Medical Association</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>China's tools for killing are advanced, while tools for saving lives are vague. For example, the national army has abandoned old-fashioned bows and arrows and adopted new guns and cannons. Medicine has no distinction between Chinese and Western, old and new, only between scientific and unscientific. Domestic medicinal materials should continue to be researched and organized using scientific methods. Doctors should strive to enable the Chinese people to enjoy the benefits of new medicine. Fellow Delegates of the Third National Congress of the Federation of Medical Associations of China:</p>
<p>This congress is being held in Nanjing, and the members of the Executive Yuan express their sincere congratulations. It is said that the first congress was held in Shanghai, and the second in Hangzhou, both of which made significant contributions to the future of the medical field. This congress in Nanjing will surely be the same, and will represent even more progress. The progress and development of the medical field are closely related to social stability and human happiness. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has high expectations for you all. I have heard that the congress will only last three days, and you are all working day and night, extremely busy. Therefore, we can only offer some refreshments as a token of respect. I am grateful that you have not abandoned us and have taken time out of your busy schedules to gather here. On behalf of the members of the Executive Yuan, I express my deep gratitude.</p>
<p>In the past century, as a result of scientific progress, everything has been renewed. Tools for killing, such as military weapons, and tools for saving lives, such as medicine and pharmaceuticals, have all undergone great changes. However, we feel that the Chinese people are much clearer about the progress of tools for killing, but are very vague about the progress of tools for saving lives, with a tendency to waver. How can we see this? In the late Xianfeng and early Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and others knew the benefits of foreign guns when fighting against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Since then, military factories have been building new armies. Before long, the entire national army abandoned old-fashioned bows and arrows, knives and spears, and adopted new guns and cannons. No army believed that bows and arrows, knives and spears could resist guns and cannons. Although there has been a so-called "Big Knife Saves the Nation" theory recently, this is just a game. Even the people who promote it know it's just a game. Their fundamental argument is still to prioritize the addition of guns and cannons. It can be seen that we Chinese people have a very clear understanding of the progress of tools for killing. They are never conservative, extremely innovative, and never nostalgic for old-fashioned bows and arrows, knives and spears, but actively adopt new guns and cannons.</p>
<p>As for tools for saving lives, what is the situation? Without citing other examples, just looking at the opposition between so-called Chinese medicine and Western medicine shows that we Chinese people do not have a thorough and clear judgment about the progress of tools for saving lives. If those who feel the pulse with three fingers are called Chinese doctors, then those who use bows and arrows, knives and spears can naturally be called Chinese soldiers. If those who use scientific knowledge and scientific instruments to treat diseases are called Western doctors, then those who use new guns and cannons cannot but be called Western soldiers. However, the terms "Chinese soldier" and "Western soldier" do not exist in today's society, while the terms "Chinese doctor" and "Western doctor" still exist. From this one example, it is undeniable that the Chinese people are not as clear about the progress of tools for saving lives as they are about tools for killing.</p>
<p>Originally, not only medicine, but all knowledge has no distinction between Chinese and Western, only between old and new. In fact, the words "old" and "new" are too general. It can only be said that there is a distinction between scientific and unscientific. Before the past century, Western medicine was vague and ambiguous, and it was not necessarily more advanced than Chinese medicine. In the past century, because of the development of science, scientific knowledge has been applied to medicine, and it has become modern medicine. Modern medicine is the common effort and common enjoyment of all modern human beings. As long as they are modern human beings, they must use modern medicine to enhance social stability and human happiness. There is no national distinction that can exist in this. Not only in the West, but also in the East, such as Japan, before the Meiji Restoration, medicine was entirely imitated from China. After the Meiji Restoration, they strived for the progress of modern medicine, and at the same time used modern scientific knowledge to organize Japan's inherent methods, preparations, and medicinal materials, making many contributions to modern medicine. The so-called terms "national medicine" and "Western medicine" do not exist in opposition in Japan, because there is only scientific, modern medicine, with no so-called national medicine or Western medicine.</p>
<p>When I say this, I am not denying all of our previous Chinese medicine. I know that the Chinese people, accumulating experience since Shennong, have developed many prescriptions for diseases, and that China, with its vast land and abundant resources, has many medicinal materials. These prescriptions and medicinal materials should all be continued to be researched and appropriately organized. However, research and organization require the application of scientific knowledge and scientific methods to make them a part of modern medicine, and they should never exist in opposition to modern medicine. If there is a concept of existing in opposition, then one falls into the unscientific wrong path. Therefore, I advocate that China should only have modern medicine, with no so-called Chinese medicine or Western medicine. To give an example, now there are even people who believe that Chinese medicine can treat infectious diseases and disinfect. This is truly strange. It must be known that infectious diseases come from microorganisms, and microorganisms can be seen under a microscope. They can never be felt with three fingers or seen with the naked eye. Then, how can so-called Chinese medicine know which are infectious diseases? Even knowing is impossible, so how can they treat infectious diseases and disinfect? If this is the case, then the result of so-called Chinese medicine will inevitably be to insist that non-infectious diseases are infectious diseases, and to insist that infectious diseases are non-infectious diseases. The result is just that the patient suffers, or the patient's family suffers. Insisting that infectious diseases are non-infectious diseases is even more dangerous. The result can cause harm to the entire society. We know that the prevention and eradication of infectious diseases is a major invention of modern medicine, and also a major benefit for modern human beings. If so-called Chinese medicine is allowed to exist independently from modern medicine, then we cannot but worry a lot about modern Chinese human beings. The above words are all extremely superficial, and it seems that anyone who has read a few pages of hygiene textbooks in elementary school can understand them. However, even now, the reality of the opposition between Chinese and Western medicine still exists in China, so I cannot but shake my head and sigh, saying that the Chinese people are extremely serious about tools for killing, but too perfunctory about tools for saving lives. All of you bear the responsibility of saving lives, and take saving lives as your profession. Your shaking of your heads and sighs about this reality must not be less than mine. Then, in this congress, let us discuss together how to improve this reality, that is, how to enable the Chinese people to enjoy the benefits of modern medicine, and how to enable those who take saving lives as their profession to strive for the progress of modern medicine, without any divergent ideas. This seems to be what should be paid attention to in this congress. I am a layman in medicine. Today, I can only speak to you from the standpoint of a government colleague. As mentioned above, medicine is to ensure social stability and human happiness, and the government should naturally do its best to actively protect and promote its development, and to eliminate obstacles in a negative way. This is the responsibility that the government should fulfill. Even if it cannot be fully achieved for the time being, it is necessary to strive to gradually achieve it. Today, I have invited you all to gather together for tea, in addition to expressing my respect, I can only offer this little bit of opinion and hope.</p>
<h3>Speech at the Tea Party for Representatives of the National Medical Association</h3>
<p>— Liu Ruiheng</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you have come from afar to attend the conference in the capital, and have been very busy with meetings in recent days. Today, we have prepared a simple meal and drinks to express our welcome. We are very grateful for your presence. However, due to the limited time, we are unable to report on the work of our department in detail. We can only discuss the main points briefly.</p>
<p>I have been in Nanjing for five years. I am deeply ashamed that there has not been much progress in health construction. This is mainly because the overall political, military, and financial situation in recent years has not been very stable. Therefore, the economy and talent related to various health facilities have also been affected, and I often feel difficulties. As a result, progress has not been as expected. I am very grateful for the supervision and guidance of all of you in peacetime. However, this difficult situation must be briefly mentioned in the hope that you will grant us insight.</p>
<p>In this difficult time of creation, the Ministry of Health was merged into the Health Department. Although the organization has been small since the 30th, it has striven for progress in all its work and has not dared to slack off. The two buildings of the Central Hospital and the National Economic Commission's Health Experimental Office have been newly completed. On the training of talents, and research on temporary and basic subjects, there is this foundation, the scale is roughly complete, and we can devote ourselves to it. We sincerely hope that you will visit and guide everything after the meal. However, all the funds for these two buildings, except for a portion donated by Mr. Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese, to build the Central Hospital, were raised by the government through various means, which was very difficult. It is not true that foreign countries have provided subsidies. As for other work, such as the assistance in promoting county hospitals and school hygiene, health engineering, and various bacteriology and parasitology lectures, practical facilities work are scattered in various places. Due to the limited time, I was unable to visit and explain them one by one, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>At present, there are many things to be done in medical and health matters. We all have a responsibility to promote scientific medicine. Yesterday, Director Wang gave a very detailed speech on this point. I hope that all of you will return to your respective places and do your best to develop scientific medicine. I also hope that you will provide guidance and contact us at any time in the future."</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need to Resolve Several Fundamental Issues Concerning the Future of Chinese Medicine (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hu An'an</p>
<p>Secondly, there's the so-called issue of breaking down factions within the medical community. The most significant reason for the ineffectiveness of Chinese students educated abroad in contributing to the nation lies in the obstruction caused by factionalism. Such factionalism and resulting prejudices are prevalent in every field. It is especially severe in our medical community today. Originally, science is universal. After seeking new medical and pharmaceutical knowledge abroad, the sole important duty should be to introduce new medical and pharmaceutical knowledge and enhance the medical and pharmaceutical sciences of one's own country. However, regardless of the different foreign languages learned, under the same scientific principles of medicine, a sudden division into separate camps occurs. Each group boasts of the superiority of what they learned in a particular country. This attitude and perception cause resentment and resistance among colleagues. This unfavorable phenomenon in the new medical community is most unfortunate. It has not only sown seeds within the medical community but also created an impression of factional divisions among the objective intellectual class of society. The lack of effort in self-unification, coupled with the nurturing effect of the environment, understandably leads to increasingly deep-rooted prejudices and escalating disputes within the medical community. The matter is clear and undeniable. As someone who has been involved in society, I dare say that I have been fighting for the issue of breaking down factions for years and have been chanting this slogan repeatedly. Yet, I have not achieved any significant results.</p>
<p>The emergence of factions does not happen spontaneously; it must have underlying causes. Similarly, hidden worries do not arise on the day they manifest; they must have prior signs. Therefore, the beginning of factions in the medical community today, I do not attribute to physicians serving society, but to those in the medical administration and authorities. And its prominence, I do not attribute to those who sacrifice for the sake of fairness and justice in medical affairs, but to the general opportunists. Therefore, if we are all genuinely committed to finding a satisfactory solution to medical disputes, we should prioritize scientific universality and national interests. We should eliminate factions and abandon prejudices as the main conditions. We should ensure that the entire national medical community focuses solely on promoting Chinese medical and pharmaceutical scholarship as its only responsibility. Only then can a ray of hope be left for the future of medical affairs, preventing the endless mutual sabotage seen in political tides. By eliminating the ugly and disgraceful notions of jealousy among fellow practitioners, we can cultivate a positive atmosphere of promoting medical ethics, collaborative research, and the pursuit of academic excellence. To cure a disease, one must clear its source. To treat a symptom, one must prescribe the right medicine. To rescue Chinese medical affairs from chaos and disputes, we must first start with breaking down factions. Then, with sincerity, we seek unity; with trust, we seek cooperation. This will transform the current new medical community into a new landscape. We can also foresee a bright future for medical affairs. Let all members of our medical community act in good conscience, devote themselves to national service, and implement these benevolent proposals. This will be fortunate for the Chinese medical community and a blessing for the country and its people. Therefore, the issue of breaking down factions can also be regarded as the central issue in resolving Chinese medical affairs, and it deserves serious attention.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the so-called issue of the scientificization of medicine and pharmaceuticals. If we want to make Chinese medical and pharmaceutical sciences leap forward and establish a solid foundation that lasts for thousands of years, the most problematic aspect is ensuring that non-scientific medical and pharmaceutical theories are completely transformed into scientific ones as scientific progress advances. Because Chinese scholarship lacks a solid foundation, popular beliefs may embrace theories that contradict science. Therefore, under the creed of science, the entire Chinese medical and pharmaceutical issue, based on the laws of natural science, should strive for consistency and seek scientificization. This will not only avoid all domestic academic disputes but also align with international norms of scientific universality. This scientificization movement should be initiated by physicians with scientific training to make rational choices to meet the urgent needs of Chinese medicine. Then, the medical and pharmaceutical sciences that align with science can be promoted, while all non-scientific medicine and pharmaceuticals will be eliminated, no longer having a place to exist. This is an inevitable fact driven by natural trends. As for scientific medicine and pharmaceuticals, they do not need to seek scientificization, but they must bear the responsibility of rapidly guiding non-scientific medicine and pharmaceuticals towards scientificization. They must also first seek the resolution of the above two issues. This is clearly a common goal for the medical community.</p>
<p>Fourthly, there is the issue of the distribution and career paths of medical and pharmaceutical talent. The medical affairs center undoubtedly has the responsibility of distributing medical and pharmaceutical talent. However, improper distribution will create significant conflicts with the first two fundamental issues. We urgently need to ensure that people are given full scope to their talents and that they are able to use their skills to the fullest. Only then can they truly be in the right roles. We must avoid any biases or imbalances. Let the nation's medical and pharmaceutical talent be placed according to their interests so that everyone can be in the right position. Then, all medical undertakings can be swiftly successful with the combined strength of the medical community. Conversely, if a portion of the medical and pharmaceutical community is left out, leading to their skills being unused, it is a loss to the country, let alone the individuals themselves. In recent years, the medical community serving society has been concentrated in large cities, seemingly presenting an image of talent surplus. However, when considering the national area and population distribution, there is still a sense of inadequacy. The central government has a registered survey, and it should have an overall plan to allow everyone to settle into their profession and jointly promote the construction of Chinese medical affairs. This is an essential measure for medical administration. The career paths of newly graduated medical and pharmaceutical talent from medical and pharmaceutical schools should be planned in advance. This is what the state should do for technical talent. And for the future of Chinese medical affairs, even greater attention should be paid to their career paths. Talent should not be wasted, such as not allowing those who can take greater responsibility in medical affairs to be in unsuitable positions. Talent should not be misused, such as ensuring that those with a solid foundation in medicine and pharmacology can obtain suitable positions. Talent should not be squandered, such as not allowing those who can contribute to the medical and pharmaceutical community to be engaged in non-pharmaceutical work. These points all refer to a country with medical affairs on the right track and can also be regarded as a major plan to seek proper career paths for medical and pharmaceutical talent. It is also necessary to consider the needs of all aspects of medical affairs so that the further education of medical and pharmaceutical talent has correct standards and stable guarantees. And they can devote their talents to medical and pharmaceutical sciences to serve the country. This also has a close relationship with medical education. This issue is also part of the social problem, and our medical community should discuss it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Fifthly, medical education should focus on practical application. Looking at major Chinese cities, there is concern that medical talent is becoming excessive. However, in reality, it cannot yet be considered sufficient. It can be seen that medical education should focus on societal needs and cultivate practical talent for treating illnesses among the people. This is currently the most urgent goal to pursue. Advanced medical research institutions are, of course, places for cultivating basic medical talent and generating scholars. And practical medical vocational schools that emphasize both agriculture and industry have already been determined by the central government as the direction of educational measures. In the current Chinese situation, the key to medical education in various provinces lies here. We completely discuss matters as they are and make fair proposals. This issue should not be ignored.</p>
<p>The above are the major points that I believe are the significant fundamental issues that the medical community should urgently resolve. There are more issues than these, but due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate on them all. I will discuss them in another article. Today, I am delighted to witness the grand opening of the Third National Physicians' Association Congress in the capital. Colleagues are gathered together to discuss major medical affairs, which is equivalent to indirectly discussing a part of major national affairs. How so? By fulfilling their duties. This article was drafted in response to the journal's solicitation. I am aware that my words may not be entirely appropriate, but with all sincerity, if it benefits the country and the future of medical affairs, I am willing to follow my colleagues with the spirit of sincere unity, to exert the potential of our path, so that the bleak future of Chinese medical affairs will be bright from now on. Perhaps, my humble concerns can also gain the sympathy of my colleagues. I not only offer my heartfelt prayers for the medical community.</p>

<p>Answer: A lung abscess is a suppurative disease of the lung caused by pyogenic bacteria.</p>
<p>Question: What are the causes of lung abscesses?</p>
<p>Answer: If the abscesses are multiple in the lung, the cause is due to systemic pyemia, resulting in infection. If it is a localized abscess, the causes are infectious lung disease, foreign body inhalation, rib fractures, gunshot wounds to the lung, extra-pulmonary abscesses, and penetration of liver parasites.</p>
<p>Question: What are the symptoms of lung abscesses?</p>
<p>Answer: If the abscess is small, there are no special symptoms. Common subjective symptoms are also few. Some patients may experience chest pain.</p>
<p>Question: What is the pattern of fever in patients?</p>
<p>Answer: The fever is very high, sometimes intermittent, often accompanied by chills and shivering.</p>
<p>Question: What is the general condition of patients with lung abscesses?</p>
<p>Answer: Patients are severely weakened, with a poor pulse and rapid breathing. But after the pus is discharged, there is a sudden relief.</p>
<p>Question: What is the condition of the sputum coughed up by such patients?</p>
<p>Answer: The sputum is very thick and plentiful. After standing, it separates into two layers. The upper layer is greenish and thin, and the lower layer is purely purulent. The amount of sputum is directly proportional to the severity of the cough.</p>
<p>Question: What does the patient feel in the chest?</p>
<p>Answer: There is localized tenderness in the affected part of the lung.</p>
<p>Question: What abnormalities are found during percussion and auscultation?</p>

<p>Answer: If it is superficial, surgery can be performed.</p>
<h3>Casual Chat After Diagnosis (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Senyu</p>
<p>(Yi) Pancreatic Juice: This liquid is secreted and excreted into the duodenum by the pancreas. It is a clear, viscous liquid that is alkaline. The liquid contains three enzymes: amylase, alkaline protease (translated as trypsin), and lipase (translated as steapsin or called lipase).</p>
<p>(1) Amylase: Converts starch in food into sugar, but in an alkaline solution.</p>
<p>(2) Alkaline Protease: The previously mentioned acid protease only digests in an acidic solution. This enzyme is the same as acid protease, breaking down proteins into easily absorbed amino acids, but in an alkaline solution, hence the name.</p>
<p>(3) Lipase: Decomposes undigested fats into fatty acids and glycerol. The latter two can dissolve and mix in water. Glycerol is water-soluble. Fatty acids combine with alkalis like potassium or sodium in bile to form potassium or sodium fatty acids, which is called saponification. Only then can it be absorbed.</p>
<p>(Yin) Intestinal Juice: Secreted and excreted by the small glands lining the intestinal walls. Its known function is to make the intestinal fluid alkaline, because the above enzymes only work in an alkaline liquid. Moreover, the chyme transported from the stomach to the duodenum carries some oxygen, which can make it alkaline, so as not to harm the enzymes in the intestine. (3) A brief description of the entire digestive system's work until food becomes fecal residue is given later.</p>
<p>Liquid foods such as milk and broth are sucked in by the movement of the mouth, then swallowed and reach the esophagus. Dry and solid foods are grasped by the lips and teeth. While chewing with the teeth, they are held between the tongue and the hard palate. After a portion is chewed fine, the tongue pushes the unchewed portion to the middle of the two rows of teeth. These subtle movements continue until the entire portion is chewed fine, then it is sent to the base of the tongue. These chewed food fragments are moistened by saliva to become chyme. An amylase called "ptyalin" in saliva converts a portion of the starch into sugar, which is absorbed by the mucous membrane of the oral cavity and reaches the blood in the blood vessels. A mucus called "mucin" lubricates the chyme and moistens it, making it easy to swallow. Then, the muscles of the tongue, palate, and pharynx push downwards, swallowing the chyme into the esophagus. The muscles of the esophagus push it down section by section. The pyloric sphincter of the stomach opens, pouring it into the stomach. Successive bites are constantly sent in, stored in the stomach. Then, the two layers of muscles in the stomach interlock and push, stirring the chyme, making it thinner and more crushed. The dilute hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice congeals the protein, and then an acid protease called "pepsin" penetrates it, converting it into soluble "peptone," which is absorbed by the intestinal mucosa into the blood in the blood vessels. Other food fragments such as tendons, cartilage, hard bones (accidentally swallowed), various animal cell tissues such as skin, membranes, muscle fibers, etc., and plant cell fiber tissues such as leaves, wood, stems, bark, roots, etc., are softened, the liquid inside is extracted. Starches contained in rice, wheat, potatoes, beans, etc. are also softened and become soluble. The undigested substance and residue remain mixed in the chyme and are gradually pushed down. The muscles of the stomach push section by section, opening the pylorus and pouring it into the duodenum. However, the chyme still carries gastric juice downwards, so the intestinal juice secreted by the intestinal glands removes the acidity.</p>

<h3>A Panoramic View of Medicine and Pharmaceuticals in Shanghai Over the Past Ten Years Published</h3>
<p>This book, published and authored by Dr. Pang Jingzhou, describes the actual conditions between medicine and pharmaceuticals and society in Shanghai, touching upon various informal treatments, publications, education, and medical administration. The intention is to enable the medical community itself and the social community to have a general understanding of domestic medicine and pharmaceuticals based on Shanghai as the standard, so as to jointly seek improvement. In particular, it can serve as a compass for patients in the city seeking medical treatment. The price is forty cents of a silver dollar per copy. Out-of-town areas should add postage.

<p>Excellent Pain Reliever: Those who have suffered from gout will inevitably experience the feeling of "remembering the pain after it has stopped." During hospitalization, when the doctor is performing treatment, the pain experienced may last for several days or even ten days, piercing the heart and lungs, causing unbearable suffering. Although recovery is fortunate, the impression of pain remains deeply ingrained in the mind. Therefore, when thinking about it afterward, there is always a feeling of palpitation, and every time it is recalled, there seems to be residual pain. According to all kinds of pain, it is the result of intense reactions caused by electrical baths in the treatment of rheumatism, such as muscles and bones. However, after the treatment, the pain gradually decreases, and patients also confirm that electrical baths are a truly beneficial treatment. However, the drawback is that it is still impossible to prevent all adverse phenomena caused by reactions resulting from the treatment. Therefore, to reduce this kind of pain, one can only resort to medicinal cakes. Later, the great doctors of the famous Baden Hospital near Vienna, after much thought and research, and after repeated strict tests, finally proved that the most effective pain reliever is the world-renowned Gardan. Even more noteworthy is that other pains, such as massage and bowel cleansing, are indeed unbearably painful. Only Gardan can cure them, and they all improve immediately. Based on this, it can be known that Gardan can indeed reduce the pain of disease treatment and truly give patients the supreme comfort and miraculous effect of a sacred medicine. (Source) This product is made from the stems of the Ephedra Sinica Stapf Ephedra equisetina Bunge and Ephedra distachye Linn's plants of the Ephedraceae family, produced in northern China, collected and dried in autumn before frost.</p>
<p>(Characteristics) This product has a slight odor, a converging and slightly numbing taste. The shape varies depending on the plant, as described below:</p>
<p>(1) Ephedra sinica Stapf This plant is the most common product on the market. It is a herb, about one-third of a meter in total length. The green stem grows from the root, more than 1mm thick, slightly flat, with a rough surface and sparse branching. The length of the internodes is about 3-5 cm. The nodes have scale-like leaves about 3mm long.</p>
<p>(2) Ephedra equisetina Bunge This plant is 1-2m in total length and is a large tree. The green stem grows from the lignified stem, is round and smooth, with many branching forks, and the diameter is slightly smaller than the former. The length of the internodes is 1-3 cm, and the scale leaves are also smaller than the former, with white tips.</p>
<p>(3) Ephedra distachye Linn'e This plant is 1m in total length. It is a slightly woody plant. The green stem grows from the woody stem, is round and rough, with branching forks, and the diameter is larger than the first type. The length of the internodes is 2-5 cm, and the scale leaves are smaller than the first type, showing a light green color.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The main ingredient in this product is ephedrine, discovered by Japanese pharmaceutical doctor Nagai Nagayoshi, with the structural formula C6H5CH.OH.CH3.NH.CH3. It is a colorless crystal, odorless, with a slightly very bitter taste, and it can combine with chlorine to form ephedrine hydrochloride.</p>
<p>(Efficacy) This product is a diaphoretic. The main function of ephedrine is to increase blood pressure, increase heart strength, constrict blood vessels of the mucous membrane, dilate the bronchioles, and cause spasms. These effects are all caused by its ability to stimulate the connection between the sympathetic nervous system and muscles. Its effect is very similar to adrenaline, but there are also differences. For example, ephedrine can stimulate intestinal muscles and the central nervous system, and it has the effect of inhibiting secretory function, and its effect on metabolism also has little change. There are two advantages of ephedrine over adrenaline: one is that it can be taken orally, and the other is that it lasts longer.</p>
<p>The main application of ephedrine is to treat asthma, taking it two or three times a day, which can also have a preventive effect. Applying it to the nasal cavity can immediately shrink the swollen mucous membrane, so using it when you have a cold can save the patient from the suffering of nasal congestion. It can also be used during nasal surgery. Because it has the effect of increasing blood pressure, it can be used to prevent a sudden drop in blood pressure during spinal anesthesia. In addition, there are many other applications, such as pain in the skin, dysmenorrhea, all of which have their corresponding places.</p>
<p>(Appendix Old Sayings) Shennong's Materia Medica says that ephedra is bitter and warm in taste. It mainly treats stroke, typhoid fever, headache, heat, promotes sweating, removes evil heat, stops cough and dyspnea, and removes cold and heat. This medicine has stems growing in clusters and standing upright. It has a converging qi and taste and has the power of dispelling. Therefore, it resolves evil qi obstruction to clear the pores and is specialized in draining water and dampness to remove pain in the bones and joints. When used with cinnamon twigs, which are released to the surface, it can treat sudden onset. This is the effect of the ephedra soup and daqinglong soup. When used with gypsum, which clears and lowers, it can benefit water and dampness. This is the effect of Yuebei soup and Maxinggan. The ancients only filled the leaves with sweat. After careful examination, it does not have the effect of sweating. Zhang Zhongjing said that after sweating, you should not use cinnamon twig soup again. Those who sweat and gasp without high fever should use Maxinggan stone soup. This can be subtle.</p>
<p>(Note) Although ephedrine in ephedra was discovered many years ago, the medical community paid little attention to it until five years ago, when Chen Kehui of China and Schmidt of the United States re-analyzed and studied it in detail. In recent years, its application has become widespread throughout the world. There are many articles on this drug in European and American medical newspapers and magazines. Chen Kehui and Schmidt have recently collected the research results of scholars from all over the world, and summarized them into a great achievement, which was published in the most famous medical journal in the United States. The references are about 400 kinds or more, and most of them are recent works. There are very detailed discussions on the chemical properties, pharmacological effects, and clinical applications of ephedra.</p>

<h3>Report on Vocational Education from the Ministry of Education Commissioner's Inspection in Europe</h3>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Craftsmen Schools: These schools are established to cultivate workshop foremen or craftsmen in manufacturing industries. Foremen and craftsmen bear the responsibility of guiding all workers in their work, which is a heavy and complex task. Therefore, the training is also rigorous. Students entering the school must have completed five years of elementary school and have undergone apprenticeship training and worked in a workshop for two to three years.</p>
<p>The school curriculum varies depending on the nature of the subject, and the graduation years also differ. For example: (1) Four mechanical craftsman schools, 46 hours per week, graduation in two years; (2) One electrical craftsman school, graduation in three years; (3) Six architectural craftsman schools, graduation in three years; (4) One flour mill craftsman school, graduation in one year; (5) One mechanical repair craftsman school, graduation in one and a half years, two school semesters, 36 hours per week, seven months of factory practice; (6) Glass craftsman school, graduation in three years. The factory equipment of these schools strives for perfection, producing many talented individuals, making great contributions to production increase and product improvement.</p>
<p>Industrial Schools: The subjects in these schools are classified even more intricately. Generally speaking, they include the following: machine manufacturing, electrical engineering, radio engineering, aviation and automobile engineering, metallurgy, wood chemical processing, sugar manufacturing, flour industry, brewing, textile, dyeing, mining, glass industry, foundry industry, chemical industry, river and highway construction, railway construction, topographic surveying, agricultural improvement, etc. The main purpose of the curriculum is to train technicians or engineering specialists in various industries who can take full responsibility. Industrial schools are divided into two categories based on the students' level: basic industrial schools and higher industrial schools. Basic industrial schools have a lower level, and most students entering have graduated from elementary school. The study period ranges from three to four years, with 42 hours per week. Graduates can take on positions such as supervisors and technical assistants. The allocation of class time is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Vocational subjects account for 60% of teaching time. (2) Basic sciences account for 20% of teaching time. (3) General education accounts for 20% of teaching time.</p>
<p>Higher industrial schools have a higher level, and students entering must have studied up to the sixth grade of middle school. The study period ranges from two to three and a half years, with 42 hours of coursework per week. Graduates can work as assistant engineers in the construction engineering industry or chief engineers in production industries. The allocation of subject time is as follows: (1) Vocational subjects account for 77% of the time. (2) Basic sciences account for 16% of the time. (3) General education accounts for 7% of the time.</p>
<p>For those who are already employed and cannot enter higher-level schools, or who have not received training in professional engineering knowledge, there are industrial classes. These are similar to remedial classes, but with a focus on vocational subjects. The study period ranges from six months to two years. Specialized training classes are available in areas such as mechanical structure, metalworking, welding, electrical repair, radio, construction, road construction, textile, brewing, and drafting. Agricultural Schools and Agricultural Classes: Agricultural schools have subjects such as agriculture, forestry, horticulture, sericulture, vegetables and fruits, dairy production, and animal husbandry. The study period ranges from two to three years, and the level is not uniform, depending on the students entering. Lower-level schools accept elementary school graduates or students who have studied at the elementary level, while higher-level schools accept middle school students. There are currently 129 lower-level agricultural schools in Poland, with the following characteristics: 76 agricultural schools for men, 43 agricultural schools for women, 5 horticultural schools, 3 livestock schools, 1 poultry school, and 1 agricultural cooperative school. Except for 27 private schools, the rest are established by the national or local government.</p>
<p>There are sixteen secondary agricultural schools and three higher agricultural schools nationwide. In addition, there are various agricultural training classes for ordinary rural workers to provide supplementary education in preparation for rural improvement work, such as holding exhibitions and product competitions.</p>
<p>Commercial Schools: The need for commercial talent is not limited to stores. Banks, companies, government-licensed businesses, and other administrative agencies that handle goods and money all require personnel with commercial knowledge to manage them. Therefore, the scope of service is very broad, and the school curriculum is correspondingly extensive, but not excessively so. Regarding commercial knowledge, identifying goods, transportation and storage, origin of raw materials, buying and selling habits, law, Chinese language, foreign language, mathematics, typing, calligraphy, commercial bookkeeping, accounting, shorthand, and the application of calculating machines are all urgently needed. However, general education and physical education are also given due attention.</p>
<p>Some commercial schools are national and tuition-free for students. Others are established by chambers of commerce and subsidized by the government. Impoverished students with excellent grades can receive free education or scholarships. Commercial tutoring classes are all established and maintained by the government and local governments, and admission is free. In recent years, more and more women are working in stores, so the number of commercial schools for women is increasing, and many commercial schools are co-educational.</p>
<p>Vocational Schools: The management of food, clothing, housing, and transportation in hotels, teahouses, hospitals, summer resorts, and private homes is also a type of profession. Whether the management and operation are legal or not has a significant impact on economic gains and losses. Therefore, there are specialized schools for training. The nature of these schools can be divided into two categories: the first category is to train supervisors or assistant personnel for hotels, sanatoriums, candy stores, bakeries, etc.; the second category is to train private housewives in their duties to suit social and economic conditions.</p>
<p>Vocational Normal Schools: Teachers of vocational subjects for women, such as clothing, sewing, embroidery, hat making, and home economics, are trained in specialized schools. Students entering must have graduated from middle school or vocational school, or have studied at the middle school level for six years. The study period is three years. After graduation, they work as assistant teachers for two years, and then pass an examination to become regular teachers.</p>
<p>Remedial Schools: Poland, like other European countries, requires young men and women under the age of eighteen who are already employed to attend remedial schools. This is a national legal requirement. These remedial courses are taught for eight to twelve hours per week, either during the day or in the evening.</p>
<p>Most remedial schools are established by the government, and a small number of private schools also receive government subsidies. According to statistics from 1930 to 1931, there were 742 schools in 506 cities and towns across the country, divided into 4,022 classes, with a total of 107,000 students.</p>
<p>(1) Funding</p>
<p>Higher vocational schools require significant expenses for equipment and maintenance. Most of them are national in nature, with all expenses provided by the central government. Ordinary craftsman schools receive about one-third of their total funding as subsidies. However, most girls' schools are established by private individuals or social groups. Remedial schools and private vocational schools all receive state subsidies.</p>
<p>The central vocational education funding is paid for by commercial surtaxes. This surtax was promulgated and implemented in 1925, and the subsidy for vocational education is stipulated as 25% of the regular fee, with one-fifth used for higher vocational schools and the remaining four-fifths used for apprentice education and employment guidance.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Warsaw National Women's Vocational School: This school is divided into higher and lower divisions, with the following departments:</p>
<p>1. Bookbinding: 3 years graduation</p>
<p>2. Garment Making: 3 years graduation, 7 years elementary school</p>
<p>Lower Division 3. Embroidery: 4 years graduation, required for admission</p>
<p>3. Commerce: 4 years graduation</p>
<p>4. Photography</p>
<p>Higher Division Middle school graduation of six years required for admission</p>
<p>5. Commerce</p>
<p>There are 48 teachers, of which 16 are full-time. The remaining teachers are current technical personnel in various industries. There are a total of 500 students in the higher and lower divisions.</p>
<p>Equipment: (1) Bookbinding Department: three bookbinding workshops, 34 workbenches, specializing in printing, stitching, gilding, bookbinding, and other work; (2) Sewing Department: three studios, 50 sewing machines, used as a sewing practice room for third-year students, and practicing the layout of the sewing workshop; fourth-year embroidery classroom, 16 workbenches; (3) Photography Department: 1. Photography, 2. Copying, 3. Developing, 4. Retouching, 5. Darkroom and other practical training.</p>
<p>Tuition: 90 Zloty per year for lower-level students (equivalent to 45 national currency), 100 Rioty per year for higher-level students (equivalent to 50 national currency).</p>
<p>Curriculum: Religion, Polish, history, legal system, economic geography, physics, chemistry, physical and chemical experiments, singing, social economics, handicrafts, commercial correspondence, commercial law, business ethics, typing, shorthand.</p>
<p>Specialized Courses: (1) Accounting, Bookkeeping; (2) Optics; (3) Analytical Chemistry; (4) Economics.</p>
<p>State Institute of Manual Instruction</p>
<p>This institute was established in 1915 with the assistance of the Warsaw Municipal Education Bureau. It was initially attached to another location, with a one-year study period. It was gradually expanded and transformed into the current school in 1923, and the study period was also changed to two years. Its main purpose is to train manual arts teachers for normal schools, secondary schools, and senior primary schools. It also offers a one-year graduate-level fine arts and crafts class, designed to train primary school fine arts and crafts teachers. Both male and female students are admitted, but they must have graduated from a normal school or secondary school and be proficient in fine arts and crafts. However, the one-year fine arts and crafts class also admits primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Manual Arts Class Curriculum</p>
<p>Subject (Male Class) (Female Class) Year 1 Year 2 Year 1 Year 2</p>
<p>(1) Woodworking Crafts 10 8 6 4</p>
<p>(2) Metalworking Crafts 6 4 | 4</p>

<p>(12) Plaster Science</p>
<p>(13) Fine Arts and Crafts Teaching Methods 3 2 3 2</p>
<p>Total Weekly Hours 42 42 43 42</p>
<p>The curriculum for the one-year advanced art and craft class is similar, but with a slight increase in weekly hours.</p>
<p>Graduates can hold teaching positions in fine arts and crafts in primary and secondary schools. After teaching for two years, passing an examination on educational principles at the University of Warsaw will grant them certification as formal fine arts and crafts teachers in secondary schools and normal schools.</p>
<p>The institute's responsibility is not only to train manual arts teachers, but also to inspect manual arts teaching methods in ordinary schools, improve the curriculum, introduce new workshop equipment and tools, and publish books and newspapers. The "Polish Handicraft Society" has now been established, specializing in compiling and writing books and publications on handicraft arts.</p>

<h3>Shandong Province Sends Students Abroad for Study</h3>
<p>Limited to those studying various industries</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The Department of Education has been actively reorganizing education in the province for the past three years, making significant progress. It also selects government-funded students to study in Europe, America, and Japan every year for advanced studies. The examination began on April 1. This examination is limited to those studying various industries, with the aim of returning to the country to help the industries of this province. Three people will be sent to the United States, limited to studying physics, electrical engineering, or hydraulic engineering; two people to Germany, limited to studying medicine, mechanical engineering, or industrial chemistry (glass); two people to France, limited to studying industrial chemistry, industrial production, or glass; and three people to Japan, limited to studying medicine, aquaculture, or industrial chemistry.</p>
<h3>Free Education for Primary and Secondary Schools in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has slightly revised and approved the "Provisional Rules for Waiving Tuition Fees for Students in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools," as reported by the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The preferential treatment of providing free admission to charitable halls and women's and children's schools will be abolished. The main points of the approved methods for waiving tuition fees for students in municipal primary and secondary schools are that students in municipal primary and secondary schools who meet one of the following qualifications may request free education: (1) those from impoverished families; (2) the children of revolutionary heroes who cannot afford to pay tuition; (3) the children of current primary and secondary school and compulsory primary school teachers. (Explanation) For free middle schools under item 1, the limit is three students per class. For primary schools, the number of students is determined by the Social Affairs Bureau based on the school environment and family circumstances, divided into five types: Type A free education accounts for 8% of the entire school, Type B accounts for 16%, Type C accounts for 24%, Type D accounts for 32%, and Type E accounts for 40%. If the number of free students exceeds the limit (the Social Affairs Bureau also designates certain schools in the city as Type A and certain schools as Type E), the decision will be made based on academic performance.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Has Decided on the Selection of Items to be Photocopied from the Siku Quanshu</h3>
<p>Photocopying 232 Types of Classics, Histories, Philosophies, and Literary Collections</p>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Education, in order to promote Chinese culture and disseminate rare copies of the Siku Quanshu, specifically entrusted the Commercial Press to photocopy the Siku Quanshu collection of the Beiping Library. However, considering the large number of volumes in the complete collection, photocopying the entire set would be extremely costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, a significant portion is already circulated in the market, with many finely engraved editions. Therefore, it was deemed unnecessary to photocopy the entire collection. The Ministry decided to select and publish rare editions that are not commonly available, and has already signed a contract with the Commercial Press to begin photography. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Selection Committee The Ministry of Education, in order to meticulously select rare copies from the Siku Quanshu, specifically appointed experts with profound knowledge of Chinese studies to be responsible for compiling the selection list. It also organized a Committee for Compiling a Catalogue of Rare Unprinted Editions of the Siku Quanshu. The committee members include Li Shengduo, Dong Kang, Chuan Zengxiang, Chen Yuan, Yuan Tongli, Xu Naichang, Liu Chengan, Zhang Zongxiang, Xu Hongbin, Fu Sinian, Liu Yicheng, Zhang Yuanji, Ma Heng, Zhao Wanli, Gu Jiegang, and fifteen others.</p>
<p>Finalized Catalogue After the establishment of the committee, the selection list for photocopying has been largely finalized, including 61 types of Classics, 20 types of History, 34 types of Philosophy, and 117 types of Literary Collections,</p>
<p>a total of 232 types. All are rare editions not easily collected externally, making them highly valuable. Additionally, each committee member will compile a catalogue of rare books from the Siku Quanshu, detailing the origins and developments of each edition, its academic school of thought, and an overview of the complete work for reference.</p>
<p>Start of Printing The selected books have now been transported to Shanghai, where the Commercial Press is constructing a temporary photography workshop on the vacant land at No. 26 Tianzhutang Street, the Shanghai storage site of the Palace Museum. Photography began on November 17th of last year. The photography of the entire collection is expected to be completed in about seven and a half months, and photocopying should commence around June of this year, with pre-orders being offered. The pre-order price has not yet been determined, but it is estimated to be around 500 to 600 yuan per set.</p>
<h3>Academic Institutions Organize Hainan Biological Collection Group</h3>
<p>Departing Around the 10th of this Month from Gaojing</p>
<p>Collection Divided into Land and Sea Groups, Scheduled for One Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, together with the Biological Laboratory of the Science Society of China, the Beiping Institute of Biological Survey of the Academia Sinica, and various universities, have initiated the organization of the Hainan Biological Science Collection Group, which is now ready to depart around the 10th of this month. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Organization The Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China has long been dedicated to collecting and surveying biological species within the country. Since its establishment more than a decade ago, it has achieved remarkable results. Since the fall of the Four Northeastern Provinces and the occupation of the Nine Small Islands, the borderlands have been increasingly encroached upon, and remote areas have attracted greater attention from foreigners. Upon entering the country, they generally use academic research groups as a guise. Dr. Bing Zhi, Director of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society, felt this keenly and initiated the organization of the Hainan Biological Science Collection Group to conduct large-scale collections.</p>
<p>Participating Institutions Considering that Hainan Island is far from Shanghai, involving extensive travel and transportation, and incurring significant expenses, the Institute, being a private organization with limited funds, found it extremely difficult to manage. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the undertaking, there were concerns that one institution alone might not be able to handle it. Therefore, the Institute invited the National Central Research Institute's Museum of Natural History, the Beiping Institute of Biological Survey, National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Shandong University, a total of five institutions, to participate and collaborate. The group is scheduled to depart from Beijing around the 10th of this month, with a collection period of one year.</p>
<p>Collection Methods The group's collection methods are divided into land and sea groups, meeting in Nanjing, and departing in batches.</p>
<p>It has now been decided that Dr. Bing Nongshan, Director of the Biological Research Institute, will oversee the entire operation. The collection teams will be led by Wu Xianwen, Wang Yikang, Zuo Jingran, He Qi, and Ni Dashan. The leader of the first collection team is Zuo Jinglie. Mr. Zuo is currently a professor in the Biology Department of Shandong University and has collected in Hainan for many years, making him very familiar with the situation in Hainan and local customs. Once all the collection results are compiled, a special report will be published. Purpose of the Trip This trip is dedicated to the collection of biological specimens, from anthropological and folklore surveys to the exploration of lower-level protozoa and lower-level plant fungi. It covers all vertebrates and invertebrates. However, higher-level plants are excluded because Professor Chen Huanyong of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has already been researching them for many years, and his detailed report will be published soon.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Representative Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the JN University Uproar</h3>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The uproar at National Jinan University over the expulsion of the president has not yet been resolved. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has sent representatives to Shanghai to investigate. Representatives from the Beijing Alumni Association went to the university yesterday to mediate with the students, but without result. The Shanghai Alumni Association also held a joint meeting of its executive and supervisory committees to discuss everything. Today, all members of the "Expel Zheng Association" will go to the pier to welcome Trustee Sun. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Representative Comes to Shanghai The Student Self-Government Association recently sent representatives to Beijing to submit petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, considering that the university is an educational institution for overseas Chinese, concerning the studies and cultivation of overseas Chinese children, and having a significant impact, in addition to Director Chen of the Education Department of the Commission instructing the representatives to return to the university and resume classes, it is reported that the Commission resolved at its 60th regular meeting on the 6th of this month to send Chen Chunpu, Director of the Education Department, to Shanghai to conduct a detailed investigation for review and action.</p>
<p>Beijing Alumni Association Mediation Five representatives from the Nanjing Jinan Alumni Association, including Wang Zhu, Zhang Jiadong, and Shen Guojin, came to Shanghai to mediate the uproar at their alma mater. They went to the university at 1:00 PM yesterday to contact the "Expel Zheng Association." Members Chen Tianhe and Ben Can received them in a private capacity, first reporting on the course of the uproar and the determination to expel Zheng, and thanking them for their kind intention to mediate. The Beijing representatives then spoke, hoping that all students would consider the overall interests of Jinan University, that alumni would care about their alma mater, and that they could discuss specific solutions under the premise of unchanging major principles. The Chen and Li members replied that discussions were possible under the principle of expelling Zheng, otherwise there would be no way to proceed. The meeting lasted for one hour and ended without results.</p>
<p>Shanghai Alumni Association Held Meeting Yesterday The Shanghai Jinan Alumni Association held a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting at the China News Agency at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Ping Zuren, Wang Wei, Kang Laiwen, Wei Zhenhua, Sun Yue, Li Bangdong, Liu Wangsu, and Zeng Yifu. Representatives from the Beijing Alumni Association, Zhang Jiadong, and representatives from the "Expel Zheng Association," Chen Tianhe and Fan Xifan, were present as observers. Sun Yue chaired the meeting. First, representatives from the "Expel Zheng Association" reported on the course of the uproar, requesting support for justice and unity, and not to be used as tools by individuals. The Association immediately expressed that Zheng Hongnian has been very passive recently, and as long as the university can find a suitable successor, his resignation will not be a problem. However, they hoped that the students at the university would quickly restore the original situation and that the goal of the Association was to improve Jinan University, which was the same as the goal of the "Expel Zheng Association," hoping to jointly organize and discuss solutions. Representatives from the "Expel Zheng Association" agreed to relay this intention to the students, and the meeting adjourned. The Association has now scheduled a general meeting of members to be held at the YMCA at 6:00 PM this Friday to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Welcoming Trustee Sun Today The Shanghai-based trustees of the university, including Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Kong Xiangxi, and Ma Chaojun, have all been visited separately by representatives from the "Expel Zheng Association" to explain everything. The trustees in Beijing have also been contacted by the representatives who went to Beijing to petition. Trustee Sun Zhesheng of the university arrived in Shanghai this morning on an Italian mail ship. Yesterday, the "Expel Zheng Association" specifically issued a notice to all members, scheduling a meeting at 8:00 AM today to go to the Jiangnan pier to welcome Mr. Sun and present everything to him in person.</p>
<p>General Meeting of the Middle School Department The affiliated middle school department of Jinan University held a general meeting of all students at the middle school department at 9:00 AM yesterday, resolving to firmly expel Zheng and overthrow Kuang, and organizing a middle school department self-government association to strive for the work of expelling Zheng and overthrowing Kuang.</p>
<p>Notice Denying Examinations The university originally issued a notice starting from the 4th, notifying all faculty and staff to return to the university to work and prepare for the resumption of classes. However, since the university president, Zheng Hongnian, issued a notice scheduling the end-of-semester examinations for the 8th of this month, the students believe that since Mr. Zheng has been expelled, he cannot use the university's name to issue announcements. Therefore, the Association has issued a notice to all students, unanimously denying it.</p>
<h3>Alumni Association of the Normal Department of Jingye Middle School</h3>
<p>The Alumni Association of the Normal Department of the Municipal Jingye Middle School has always been well-organized and strongly united.

His arguments were thorough and the material was valuable, lasting for more than two hours. The listeners were deeply moved. Then, more than a dozen important cases were discussed. Finally, Sun Yucai, Zhang Ren, Zhang Shaogang, Tan Bangxing, Yuan Dingchang, Yan Yude, and Hu Shinong were re-elected as directors, and Xu Yuan, Ma Zhenfu, and Xia Quanrong were re-elected as supervisors.

<h3>Students of Xinming Primary School Petition the Board of Trustees</h3>
<p>Last Sunday, students of Xinming Primary School on Baoshan Road petitioned the board of trustees because the principal intended to dismiss Mr. Song, the school's director of academic affairs, claiming that Mr. Song had a better opportunity elsewhere. The students, because Mr. Song had been in charge of the school for many years, patiently teaching and guiding them effectively, did not want Mr. Song to leave suddenly. Therefore, they lined up and marched towards the board of trustees to petition, standing at the school gate, holding white flags with the words "Request the Board of Trustees to Retain Director Song" written on them, requesting the board of trustees to find a way to retain him. It is heard that the board of trustees considers this matter to be of great importance to the future of the school and intends to convene a board of trustees meeting to discuss appropriate solutions to satisfy the students' wishes.</p>

<p>▲Five to Zero▲Group A Match</p>
<p>A cloud of melancholy, with a hint of snow, enveloped the 3,000 fans who sat precariously in the cold air of Shen Garden yesterday to watch the JN University vs. Western Police match. The result was greatly disappointing. JN University collapsed completely, suffering an unprecedented five-to-zero defeat. The performance was lackluster, and the entire team was like a heap of sand, making it hard to believe that they had once defeated Donghua two-to-zero. The reasons for their defeat and the battle situation are briefly described as follows: Reasons for Defeat Yesterday's JN University athletes seemed to be frozen in the cold air, with slow movements and sluggish actions, which was unusual. Apart from saving many dangerous balls, Gu Shangxiang was indeed a great pillar, defending the rear alone with great effort. Apart from forward Mei Hongbao, even Xu Yahui was at a loss, let alone Wang Cai. Chen Zhenxiang occasionally sent a few balls, while Zhou Shaowen seemed like a child who couldn't play the ball. With such a midfield line, how could they not be defeated? In addition, the size difference was also a major factor in yesterday's outcome. The Western Police were all tall and strong, making JN University pale in comparison. With sluggish movements, it was difficult to get the ball.</p>
<p>Prolonged Pressure For ninety minutes, JN University was under constant pressure. Although they occasionally broke through the encirclement, the enemy cavalry arrived in an instant. After the Western Police besieged them for forty minutes in the first half, the Western Police finally opened the scoring with a goal from Weigensen. It was extremely fortunate that JN University was able to remain undefeated for these forty minutes. Goalkeeper Xu Heng's excellent saves naturally accounted for half of the credit. Otherwise, there would have been countless opportunities for the Western Police to score. If the Western Police had been slightly more accurate with their shots, they would have suffered a major defeat in the first half, with the score being five or six goals or more. With the score at one-to-zero in the first half, JN University was indeed unable to defend in the second half, which was deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>Beginning of the Battle JN University had the wind at their backs, and due to Weigensen's offside, the five forwards took the opportunity to pressure the Western Police. The coordination was very good at the beginning. The Western Police counterattacked, and Weigensen and Pete opened fire from the left and right, shooting twice in a row, both of which were saved by Xu Heng. The whole stadium cheered. Yun Feng's shot was off target and fell to the rear, but fortunately, Zuo Rong headed it away, avoiding disaster. Mei Hongbao advanced, and Gibson chased him from behind. Mei sent the ball to the center, but Yahui couldn't get it. Wang Nanzhen's shot was very accurate, but it went into Booth's hands. Weigensen came again, but Zhou Shaowen was at a loss. Fortunately, Zuo Rong rushed over quickly. Wei passed to the center, and Daweier to Deterfei aimed at the goal and shot, scoring instantly, soaring into the sky. The whole stadium burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Western Police Score The Western Police No. 5 continued their attacks and entered JN University's territory again. Zuo Rong panicked and didn't know what to do. Gu Shangxiang couldn't cover everything. Fortunately, Xu Heng saw that the situation was not good and abandoned the goal to rush out, snatching the ball to safety. Luo Haiguang got the ball from the rear and went deep into the enemy lines alone. Xu De lost his footing, and it was a perfect opportunity to shoot, but he was too slow to lift his foot. The defense held until forty minutes, when they started to lose ground. Pete got the ball from Hui Shihe and sent it to the center, flying past Gu Shangxiang. Xu Heng looked back, and Weigensen had already jumped up from behind and headed the ball in. The first half ended with a score of one-to-zero.</p>
<p>Collapse Completely In the second half, the Western Police had the wind at their backs, and the situation changed even more drastically. Ten minutes later, Weigensen got a corner kick, and Xu Heng jumped up but didn't get it. Pete jumped up from the left and right and headed the ball in, making it two-to-zero. A minute later, Pete attacked along the sideline again, and Gu Shangxiang chased him. Forced to pass to the center, Daweier scored in the middle without anyone guarding him, making it three-to-zero. Deterfei scored again, making it four-to-zero.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick With fifteen minutes left in the game, JN University launched a desperate counterattack to avoid a complete shutout. Wang Nanzhen passed to Xu Yahui, and Yahui charged in alone. There was no one in front of him, heading straight for the goal. Xu De rushed over from behind and collided with him, and Xu fell. A penalty kick was awarded. Mei Hongbao kicked, but it was soft and weak, rolling to the right. Booth caught it, and this missed penalty kick meant that JN University would be shut out. Finally, Weigensen scored another goal, ending the game with a score of five-to-zero.</p>

<h3>The French Business Association Holds Nine Out of Ten Spots in the Western Football League Group A Championship</h3>
<p>▲Huaces and Donghua Have No Hope</p>
<p>▲With the Defeat of JN University, Competition is Also Difficult</p>
<p>The Western Football League Group A Championship has been underway for some time now, with half of the matches completed. However, the situation seems to be largely settled, and unless there is an unexpected or special change, there should be no problems. The French Business Association has won all nine of its matches, displaying impressive power. In terms of strength and results, no other team can match them. The only teams that can compete with them are Huaces and Donghua, but both teams have already suffered three defeats and one draw, with a difference of seven points in the scores. Moreover, the French Business Association has already defeated both teams in the first round. Even if they lose to both teams in the second round, their results will still be ahead. With the defeat of JN University yesterday, it is difficult to have any hope. The recent results are listed below:</p>

<h3>Public Nomination of Chu Minyi as Chairman of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation has had a history of more than ten years, with over two hundred members. The chairman was originally Li Jinglin, but after Li's death a few years ago, no one was in charge, and the affairs of the Federation have been suspended since then. Now, the directors of the Federation, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, and others, are eager to resume operations. Therefore, yesterday at 2:00 PM, a board meeting was held on the ninth floor of the YMCA, attended by more than thirty people, including Chu Minyi, Niu Tisen (representing Xu Xizhi), Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, and Sun Zhichong. Chu Minyi was publicly nominated as the interim chairman. As a result, Mr. Chu was publicly nominated to succeed as chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Zhiyi were nominated as vice-chairmen. Sixteen new directors were re-elected, including Xu Zhiyi, Hu Lou'an, Xu Qinxiang, Yu Baoqing, Xu Guanqun, Wu Yun Chu, Song Chunfang, Zhu Pinsheng, Pan Yangyao, Wang Yonghai, Zhang Bingxin, Chen Jicheng, Weng Guodong, Zhang Tianbai, Zhu Runsheng, and Cheng Nianpeng, among others.

<h3>Hésheng (Harmonious Birth)</h3>
<p>—Yan Qiao</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, there was something called "Hésheng." Both Meng Yuanlao's "Dongjing Meng Hua Lu" (Reminiscences of the Eastern Capital) and Wu Zimu's "Meng Liang Lu" (Records of Dream Liang) mention it. However, they do not explain what exactly it was. "Meng Liang Lu" only states: "Hésheng is similar to 'Qǐjīn Suíjīn,' each occupying one aspect." What is "Qǐjīn Suíjīn"? There is no way to investigate it either. However, there is "Hésheng" in the "Zhugong Diao" (All Keys and Modes), so one can infer that it was a type of singing performance. Recently, Sun Kaidi's "Catalogue of Chinese Popular Novels" explained the classification, believing that "Hésheng is a dialogue and discussion involving riddles." It is roughly similar to the current type of ventriloquism or comical performance. However, I saw a passage in Zhang Qixian's "Luoyang Jinshen Jiuwen Ji" (Old News of the Gentry in Luoyang) from the Song Dynasty, which describes it in more detail. It says: "There was a singing woman named Yang Zhuluo, who was good at Hésheng and miscellaneous teasing. She was intelligent and talented, and rare contemporaries could compare to her. Senior Tutor Yang Ningshi called her his niece, probably because he admired her intelligence. At that time, the monk Yunbian was good at vernacular lectures. He had literary talent and was quick-witted in responding. He could create thousands of words in response to sacrifice and prayer texts, according to the rank of the person involved, as if they were prepared in advance. Senior Tutor Yang Ningshi especially valued him. Yunbian was lecturing at Changchou Temple in May. Senior Tutor Yang Ningshi went to the lecture hall and sat opposite Yunbian. The singer was at his side. Suddenly, a large spider hung down from the front on a thread, right in front of Senior Tutor Yang Ningshi and in front of the monk (this sentence seems to be missing some words). Yunbian smiled and said to the singer: 'Try to mock this spider. If the mocking rhymes, I will offer two bolts of silk.' The singer didn't even need to think, and responded with a mocking song. The meaning was entirely about the spider, but the mocking words were precisely satirizing Yunbian. Senior Tutor Yang Ningshi heard it and burst into laughter. After a long time, he shouted: 'Monk, bring five bolts of silk!' Yunbian also laughed and presented her with five bolts of silk. The singer mocked the spider with the words: 'Having eaten its belly full (the sound 'yīng' refers to a square bell, describing the roundness of the belly), it travels around the temple, spinning silk. It sets up a net in the air, just waiting to kill living beings.'" (This was probably because Yunbian was fat and had a large belly.)</p>
<p>From this passage, we can see that Hésheng was not just singing, but also required improvisation, mockery, and humor to make people laugh. Therefore, we can also understand the general meaning of the two terms, Qǐjīn and Suíjīn, which refer to using the current scenery and local customs as materials for teasing. Zheng Zhenduo quoted Bai Juyi's line, "High-pitched pipes blow silver characters," and determined that the novel title Yínzìr (Silver Character) mentioned in "Meng Liang Lu" was a musical instrument used to accompany the performance. This was a delightful discovery. Now, with the evidence of Hésheng, it is another joy.</p>
<h3>At Random</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a classmate who had been abroad for a short time. He said that in terms of curriculum, several famous universities in China are not more "rigid" than those in the United States. However, Americans are more "serious" about education, while Chinese education is relatively "random." This is a point of distinction in quality. In the United States, because both those who run education and those who receive it share a deeply ingrained concept of "seriousness," neither party can afford to be "random." If one party is being "random," the other will have to ask them to "leave at their convenience." The fact that American education can achieve such results is worthy of praise!</p>
<p>I think, judging from the performance of many Chinese students in the United States, this statement seems somewhat discounted. No matter how seriously American education is run, I doubt my classmate's claim that it can reach the point where "if one party is being random, the other will have to ask them to leave at their convenience." However, it is indeed a natural fact that Chinese people, who are fond of seeing everything handled "randomly," are easily impressed by the "seriousness" when they step into an American school where there is no room for compromise.</p>
<p>Chinese people not only like to be casual when it comes to reading. From small things like spitting and urinating to big things like spreading rumors and creating chaos, there is nothing that does not involve putting effort into being "random." When a villager's land is encroached upon, they have to file a lawsuit even if it means selling the ancestral graves. Yet, they seem very casual about Japan seizing tens of millions of square miles of our land. If Americans knew about this magnanimous attitude, it would also be worthy of praise!</p>
<p>The two words "random" have many wonderful uses when carefully studied.</p>
<p>For example, when a reporter interviews an important person: "What is your mission here, sir?" The answer is always: "I have long admired the scenery here, and this time I am here to 'just' have some fun." If this clueless reporter insists on not being random and further asks, "What will you be discussing with Mr. ×××?" Then, the only news he will get is the four words "just chat!" If Americans knew about this lighthearted, freehand, and profound way of speaking, it would also be worthy of praise!</p>
<p>Although Chinese people are said to like to be casual in everything, there are also things they are not willing to be casual about.</p>
<p>I used to have a friend in Beiping who had a fixed job but also went to XX University to take a few courses. On the day the semester started, after registering, he ran to visit the Dean of Academic Affairs to ask if he could receive the lecture notes and study off-campus without attending classes. The Dean of Academic Affairs answered him with two words: "Random." Having reached a satisfactory agreement, he turned to leave. The Dean of Academic Affairs seemed to suddenly remember something and asked him "seriously": "Have you... paid the fee?"</p>
<p>Oh! There are also things that Chinese people are not willing to be "random" about! I don't want Americans to know about this concept of "seriousness." Let's keep it for ourselves to admire!</p>
<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Although "people" and "things" are absolutely inseparable, this statement refers to the affairs of the public and the part of the people who are in charge of affairs; if it is one person and one thing, sometimes it will have independence. The reason why I explain it this way is because everything in society is either a contradiction of people or a contradiction of things. For example, when people's words and actions do not match, or when the appearance and reality of things are contradictory, people usually say that it is a contradiction. Therefore, all kinds of social phenomena are full of contradictory realities.</p>
<p>On the tram, the ticket sellers of two cars that are rushing towards each other are often seen communicating with each other through eye contact. Passengers then know that they seem to be asking if there are ticket inspectors ahead, in order to determine their steps for skimming money. After a while, a ticket inspector boards the car, and the ticket seller invariably takes a step forward, respectfully calling out "Sir." After passing one station, the ticket seller shows a bitter smile, followed by a "Chilao (old man)" remark. This contradictory reality seems to have become their routine.</p>
<p>In a public banquet venue equipped with a hot water radiator, often because the temperature is too high, the men and women present feel somewhat uncomfortable. Therefore, some people shout to turn on the electric fans. Because they are afraid of the cold, they install hot water radiators; because they are afraid of the heat, they install electric fans. Now, they are both afraid of the cold and afraid of the heat. It is truly embarrassing for material civilization! As a result, they have no choice but to turn on both the hot water radiators and the electric fans. A young lady is decorated from head to toe entirely in white. We immediately know that she has either suffered the loss of her father or is in mourning, following ancient traditions, observing mourning for three years. However, the touch of lipstick on her cherry lips is clearly visible, serving as an unusual marker on her pink cheeks. Such contradictory facts are probably the result of the "contradiction" forced out by "modernity."</p>
<h3>Foresight for the Twenty-Third Year</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Last year was "National Products Year," and this year is "Women's National Products Year." During National Products Year, all unveiling ceremonies related to national products were carried out by women. All fashion exhibitions used women as mannequins. But in "Women's National Products Year," these tasks will be taken over by men.</p>
<p>The economic downturn in the cities will be even more severe this year. The collapse in rural areas will also become more intense day by day. As a result, people from rural areas will flock to the cities, and people from the cities will retreat to the countryside. Thus, the 18-story buildings will be filled with villagers, while the countryside will be filled with modern men and women. This is "communicating culture," but it still cannot solve the "food problem."</p>
<p>The price of wireless telephones will drop unexpectedly this year. Even radios with eleven or twelve tubes will only sell for ten or eight yuan each, and every household will be equipped with one. However, storytellers will feel a great shortage, and someone will open a crash course school for storytellers to meet the demand. "Education" will be particularly developed this year, and especially universities, will increase in large numbers. Moreover, they will follow the banking system and establish "North-South Branch Campuses," "North City Branch Campuses," etc., to facilitate students on one hand and increase educational efficiency on the other. Trends such as strikes and expelling principals will no longer occur, because teachers who cannot "harmonize emotionally" with students are bound to fall at the first blow.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 21: Whispering under the Lamp, Painstakingly Instructing the Weak Offspring; Leaning on a Staff, Walking under the Mountain, Coldly Observing the Heroes</p>
<p>Jiang quickly waved her hands at Guizhi and said: "Don't mention it. The night is quiet and deep. Why bother the neighbors and disturb their sleep?" Guizhi glanced at her mother, then lay down again. Jiang also had no desire to continue her needlework. She put away her needle and thread, found half a cigarette butt in the basket, sat alone and smoked for a while, and then went to sleep. When she woke up the next day, she couldn't help but feel a little worried about what happened the night before. However, after Guizhi got up, everything was as usual, and she didn't seem to notice that the incident from the night before had happened. Jiang herself was also afraid that Zhao Weng would find out about it, which would be very inconvenient, so she didn't dare to say anything. That day, after Guizhi finished her chores at home, she took out some fabric from her suitcase and sewed a small jacket for herself to wear. She didn't leave the house. It wasn't until late in the afternoon that Jiang called her to go to the street to buy a piece of tofu for dinner. She laughed and said: "Mom, how can your memory be so bad? Didn't I tell you that from today on, I won't be going out the front door?" Jiang said: "Are you still angry with me? As long as it's for a serious matter..." Before she could finish speaking, Guizhi interrupted and said: "I don't have any serious business to do outside." She was sewing clothes while sitting on a square stool by the paper window. After saying this, she forcefully tilted her body to show her absolute determination. When Jiang saw that she was about to get angry, she didn't dare to say anything more and went to buy the tofu herself for dinner. Actually, Guizhi wasn't angry. She felt that what her mother said made a lot of sense. Since Zhiji had returned to Haidian, as soon as she went out the front door, they would have the opportunity to meet each other. She was bound by her emotions and couldn't ignore him once she saw him. If they had another conversation, who knows how many troubles would arise. In order to avoid such disputes, it was better for her not to leave the house. Sure enough, from that day on, even if the sky fell at the front door, she wouldn't bother to ask about it. (285)</p>
<h3>Theater Shorts</h3>
<p>—Ruo</p>
<p>The actor Shang Xiaoyun has been away from Shanghai for six years. Everyone who loves to listen to Shang Xiaoyun's plays has been eagerly awaiting his return. He is now responding to the invitation of the Samsung Stage. It is said that he is bringing many newly written plays that have never been performed in Shanghai before. The "Madam Huarui," performed yesterday (Sunday), was one of them. There are also "Lin Siniang," "A Thousand Golds, All Virtuous," and old plays such as "Sacrifice to the River" and "Sacrifice to the Pagoda," which are plays with the most demanding singing. All will be staged in turn. I am recording this to tell the many who have a fondness for opera.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Children's Weekly "Spring and Autumn," the last line of "The Wolf Dragging the Sheep," "Children should think, why are eighteen sheep afraid of one wolf?" was mistakenly placed after "Little Joke" by the printer. It is hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Fish Farming</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>"Fish, are what I desire; bear's paw is also what I desire; if I cannot have both, I will forgo fish and choose bear's paw." Although our Mencius embraced a purely singular, non-compromising, upward-looking philosophy, fish are ultimately delicious and worth raising; as long as humans exist in this world, everyone should have the right to eat fish; they shouldn't, like lay Buddhists, monks, and nuns, collect fish today, release them tomorrow, and then collect and release them again the day after, endlessly performing the same charade. Whether in icy and snowy lands, everyone should have the necessary ambition to raise fish.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being born as a Chinese person, we suffer repeated foreign insults, successive natural disasters, and frequent internal wars, leaving you unable to die and unable to live; everyone has their own reasons, making it impossible for you to know whether to laugh or cry; therefore, I advise everyone to raise fish! Everyone should raise fish on a large scale! How annoying! Look at those swimming brocade carp, leisurely and carefree, enough to pass the years without worry.</p>
<p>Consider the past Chancellor of Shu Han, Mr. Zhuge Liang, in the eighth month of the autumn of the first year of Jianxing, when Wei dispatched five armies to seize Western Sichuan, with very powerful troops and horses. Liang did not attend to affairs for several days, alarming the Later Ruler, who immediately sent a close attendant with an imperial decree to summon Kongming to court. The messenger returned after half a day, reporting that the Chancellor was ill and could not come. The Later Ruler grew more anxious and ordered the Yellow Gate Attendant and the Counselor to inform him of the grave situation. Both went to the Chancellor's residence but were not allowed to enter, and they returned sighing. The next day, many officials came to the Chancellor's residence to wait, from morning till night, but he did not appear, causing great anxiety among the officials, who had to disperse. The day after that, the Later Ruler A Dou led many officials into the palace to report to the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager was greatly alarmed and wanted to go herself, despite her age. Fortunately, Dong Yun cited the imperial ancestral temple, which gave A Dou the courage to go in person. When the imperial carriage arrived at the Chancellor's residence, the gatekeeper hurriedly prostrated himself on the ground to welcome them. The Later Ruler asked, "Where is the Chancellor?" The gatekeeper said, "I do not know where he is. Only the Chancellor has issued an order to stop all officials from entering without permission." The Later Ruler then alighted from the carriage and walked alone to the third gate, where he found Kongming leaning on a bamboo staff, peacefully watching fish by a small pond. See how calm and composed Mr. Kongming was, handling everything with ease, displaying the demeanor of a wise chancellor to the fullest extent, and possessing a rich philosophical understanding of fish farming!</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the extremely widespread popular belief that King Wu of the rising Western Zhou Dynasty relied on the assistance of Jiang Taigong Lü Shang, who had a full beard. He sat by the Wei River, lost in thought. Despite his old age, he ignored the princes, commoners, and the crown prince who came and went, bowing and scraping, and just said humorously:</p>
<p>"Fishing! Fishing! Fishing! Fishing! Fishing! Fishing! If big fish don't come, small fish will!"</p>
<p>It was only when King Wen of Zhou personally pulled him eight hundred and eight times, what a delightful anecdote; you might as well simulate being Marquis Wu or Jiang Taigong by the fish pond, how delightful that would be!</p>
<p>Moreover, "fish moisten each other with saliva," when we look at the actions of fish, as long as you have nerves, whether healthy or weak, a moment of reflection will evoke feelings of mutual love for our fellow beings!</p>
<p>As for "You are not a fish, how do you know the joy of the fish?" "You are not me, how do you know I don't know the joy of the fish?" "You are certainly not a fish!" That is another anecdote about fish from the ancient superhuman school.</p>
<p>"Survival of the fittest!" We should cook the fish we raise in our own pots, send them to our own mouths, and at the same time, we should be aware that the delicious eater is man, and the sacrificed provider is the fish; we should imagine the glory of a strong nation and the tragic fate of a country that perishes without awareness, struggle, or resistance, just like the fish!</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese nation has reached a critical juncture, almost becoming fish in a cauldron; looking at fish farming, anyone with a conscience will be shocked; what is territory? What are rights? Why the hell are we fighting? This is yet another way to cultivate a philosophy that eliminates selfishness!</p>

<h3>On Lying</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Some time ago, I saw an article in a certain publication by my old friend Cao Ying entitled "In Praise of Lying." Although titled as praise, it actually depicted lying to a frightening degree, especially regarding the relationship between lying and promotion and wealth, which he discussed with extraordinary clarity. Although he also acknowledged the distinction between well-intentioned and malicious lies, he only discussed the most evil aspect of it.</p>
<p>I have always been deeply interested in the subtle psychology of lying. After some research, it is indeed very complex. A few years ago, I translated a short story by Japanese author Tanizaki Seiji, titled "Lies." According to his explanation:</p>
<p>"Lying must be a kind of mental illness. Just like wealthy women who don't worry about life at all, wanting to steal some trivial items when they see them in foreign goods stores; in certain opportunities, once they come into contact with the temptation of lies, they cannot help but lie no matter what. To put it more precisely, they want to show goodwill to all people, to provide all people with what they desire, but their own strength is insufficient, so they fabricate the facts, which can simply be said to be a kind of weak-willed altruist. Of course, there are indeed people in the world who lie out of despicable selfish motives, deceiving the world and seeking their own glory, but the K Bookstore clerk and my old friend Shi Yong-kun mentioned earlier are definitely not lying out of this selfish consciousness. They are good people with an unfortunate mental illness who know that the result will lead to their own demise, but still cannot help but lie."</p>
<p>The story of Mr. Tanizaki's novel is about the lying stories of the so-called K Bookstore clerk and Shi Yong-kun, which is quite interesting to tell.</p>
<p>The K Bookstore hired a clerk who seemed very enthusiastic about the bookstore's affairs, contacting people everywhere for publishing manuscripts. Every time he ran back from outside, he would either say that he had spent a great deal of effort negotiating a book with a certain doctor, or that he had arranged a novel manuscript with a certain famous writer. Once, he even came back drunk, saying that a certain doctor had treated him to a meal because they had a very投機 conversation. However, the negotiated manuscripts were never seen. When asked about them, he always had reasons to temporarily evade the issue. Finally, the boss could no longer bear it and personally went to the so-called doctor or writer to find out that there was no such thing at all. The boss, in a fit of anger, fired the clerk. Such lying certainly cannot be said to contain any malice. At most, it can only be said that he has a mental illness of lying due to temporary boasting.</p>
<p>As for the lying of Shi Yong-kun in the novel, it can truly be said to have the spirit of Don Quixote, causing greater disasters for people in order to alleviate their temporary pain. Shi Yong-kun was a big liar with many stories. The most harmful lie was this: A student in the same school, named Wu Teng, missed too many classes due to illness. When the time came for the exam on Scott's "The Lady of the Lake," he felt very difficult. By chance, he met Shi Yong-kun and told him about his difficulties in casual conversation. Shi Yong-kun had a sudden fit of mental illness and spoke nonsense, saying that the professor who taught "The Lady of the Lake" was his relative and that he could find a way to help, asking the professor to notify him of the exam questions in advance. Two days later, Shi Yong-kun indeed got the exam questions and instructed Wu Teng to keep it absolutely secret. In this way, Wu Teng felt very relieved and did not need to prepare at all. However, when the time came for the exam, he learned that the questions Shi Yong-kun had given were completely self-composed, and that he was not the nephew of any professor!</p>
<p>This lying obviously had no malice and cannot but be said to be a mental illness.</p>
<p>I think, judging from the above two examples, whether lying to consolidate one's own position or to alleviate the difficulties of others, it contains the reason for the weak's desire and the incompatibility of reality. Even a weak person will think, if only it could be like this, how great that would be, but once it is spoken out, it becomes a big lie. But there are also situations where it is impossible to overcome certain difficulties without lying, and these situations are more often encountered by the weak. That is probably why women lie more than men.</p>
<h3>"Who Exactly is Dai Baolin?" —Questioning the Editor of "New China"</h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>In order to read an article by a friend, I specially bought a copy of "New China," Volume 1, Issue 18. Looking at the table of contents, I found unexpected satisfaction. Because in addition to the article I wanted to read, it also contained several philosophical papers on Hegel and Feuerbach. I have always enjoyed reading philosophy, and I especially like reading Hegel and Feuerbach. This unexpected satisfaction should naturally be mine. So, filled with hope, I turned to the pages—until I reached the main text, where I found a notice soliciting criticism from readers. I felt that the editor's attitude was even more worthy of respect, and my hope expanded even further. If the notice was sincere, I thought the editor must be hoping that criticism would appear, or he would be disappointed. As someone filled with such hope and respect for the editor, I naturally had to read carefully, for fear of letting down the editor's good intentions.</p>
<p>In the end, the editor's hope was not in vain, but disappointment fell on my side. This disappointment was like a pill wrapped in sugar paper—it tasted terribly bitter. But I don't know: was the sugar paper used by the editor too thin and already broken, or was it because I chewed too carefully that I tasted the bitterness? Fortunately, the editor is soliciting opinions or criticisms from readers, and there is a notice as proof, so I dare to present my opinions as a reader, which can also be considered a bit of criticism.</p>
<p>First, I want to ask: "Who exactly is Dai Baolin?" It is quite obvious. Everyone can see at a glance that above the name "Dai Baolin" is an article called "The Structure and Criticism of Hegel's Logic." I believe most readers would think this is an original work and that China has a philosophical theorist named "Dai Baolin." However, this is a miracle; this is a major invention in Chinese cultural circles.</p>
<p>The so-called "The Structure and Criticism of Hegel's Logic" is actually a cut-and-paste theft from the preface to the Russian "Collected Works of Hegel," Volume 1 (Second Edition), published by the Soviet "Marx-Engels Institute." The preface was written by A. Deborin, and a Japanese translation by Kawauchi Tadahiko has already been published independently with the titles "Dialectics" (Part 1) and "Critique of Hegel's Logic." The entire book consists of more than 80,000 words, divided into thirteen sections, and what is cut and stolen here are sections nine and nine, with virtually no additions or deletions.</p>
<p>When I first read this article, I was very happy, truly believing that China had already achieved research results on Hegel. Then, I felt that it was something I had read before, and finally discovered this miracle, so I had to slam the table and exclaim in disbelief.</p>
<p>"The name Dai Baolin can also be considered a transliteration of Deborin," I thought back. Perhaps this is the strategically buried answer.</p>
<p>But then, why cut out two sections from someone else's full text? Why neither declare it as an excerpted translation nor indicate the original work, but only sign a very Chinese-sounding name, "Dai Baolin," as an essay for publication? Why not translate it as the already popular "Debolin" or list the translator's name to indicate that "Dai Baolin" is the original author? Is "Dai Baolin" supposed to represent the original author or the translator? It cannot be said that "Dai Baolin" is a translator named in admiration of Deborin, who takes a pun name representing both the author and translator to represent both parties, right? To say it is negligence, there is absolutely no such peculiar negligence in the world; to say it is a precedent, "New China" has no such strange precedent. Does the name "Dai Baolin" itself not contain another meaning? These questions then assaulted me. This cannot but require another explanation.</p>
<p>In recent years, many "soft" translators who oppose "hard translations" have emerged. Because what they want is soft skill, which ultimately cannot withstand hardness. Therefore, although readers who do not understand the original text still find it soft and fluffy, some who understand foreign languages still act as readers and sometimes turn to the original text to prove that the hard one is the genuine article and the soft one is a counterfeit. Thus, another small path and outlet have been opened for these people: that is, to copy and paste articles from foreigners and publish them directly under their own names as original works. Naturally, this method is more clever than the previous soft translation: first, it makes it difficult for people to find things to compare and expose errors, and one earns the title of author; second, one can selectively copy things that one can understand beforehand, so even if others want to compare, it is not easy to catch the errors that have already escaped; third, one only needs to read a few books roughly or have a smattering of foreign language to engage in plagiarism, which is at least faster than learning a foreign language well and then translating. As a result, those who previously did not understand or only half understood foreign languages, or those who could only do soft translations, have all become authors. Consequently, there also emerged a kind of magazine that specializes in defrauding young students who lack the ability to read foreign books of their money, only publishing tedious articles resembling lecture notes. There are even those who proclaim themselves as authors and construction critics, even though they have never published a single translation, acting as if the works of even the most authoritative theorists in the world are inferior to our authors' and therefore not worth introducing at all. Now, "New China" actually boldly cuts out two sections of someone else's article and passes it off as a Chinese essay, which is nothing more than the culmination of the above. The name "Dai Baolin" is just an escape route prepared in case someone attacks, making it easier to hide.</p>
<p>However, the editor will ultimately not escape: to say that "Dai Baolin" is Deborin, then this copyist becomes "nothing," and the editor should bear the responsibility. It is unlikely that the fee of a few yuan per thousand words will be paid to Deborin, who is far away in Russia, nor will it be given to "nothing" nearby; to say that the translator originally attached a name or even stated that there was no intention to impersonate or steal, then the editor should bear even more responsibility, and this responsibility cannot be absolved by excuses such as negligence. It is said that there are indeed some editors who do not have to suffer for others and will hand over this "Dai Baolin" to us. Therefore, in order to facilitate future conversations and respect the editor so as not to be implicated, I will finally ask the editor one more question:</p>
<p>"Who exactly is Dai Baolin?"</p>
<h3>Street Dramatist</h3>
<p>— Qing Nong</p>
<p>One afternoon, I happened to be standing in front of the building, looking at the sky, the clouds were flying; looking at the street, cars were speeding by, and people were walking leisurely. On the sidewalk across the street, a street dramatist had just put down his prop box. The drama performed by this street dramatist is the popular folk puppetry, also known as one-man show. My heart was drawn to him.</p>
<p>When I was a child, although I often saw these dramatists performing one-man shows on the street, I was young and arrogant and always looked down on them, never stopping to watch; I never quite understood how he performed or sang the songs. This time, I was determined to figure it out.</p>
<p>He inserted the wooden pole used to carry the prop box into one end of the prop box, lifted it up, and leaned it against the wall. When the prop box on top was opened, the stage for the one-man show immediately appeared. He spread out and hung down the surrounding gray-black curtain, and then pushed the other end of the prop box into the curtain. The person did not go into the curtain, but stood on or behind the prop box, and the gongs and drums immediately sounded. The stage setup technique is truly brilliant; see how simple and convenient it is.</p>
<p>The gongs and drums sounded for a while, and many children, women, and passersby who had run over from nowhere were already standing in front of the stage. Suddenly, a woman in ancient costume appeared on the stage, waving her hands left, right, forward, and backward, and turning her body in all directions on the stage. It was the character in the play walking. The woman in ancient costume stood in the center of the stage and sang a song. This was a popular tune from Jiangzhe, and I don't know what she was singing. The woman in ancient costume sang for a while, and then turned in all directions on the stage again, suddenly stopping at the right corner of the stage. Then, a man in ancient costume appeared, wearing a hat but without a fan (when I was a child, I had seen a man in ancient costume wearing a hat and holding a fan), also waving his hands left, right, forward, and backward, and turning his body in all directions on the stage, standing in the center of the stage and singing. The male lead sang for a while, and then the female lead stood in the center of the stage to sing again. After they both sang, they both spoke their lines. Suddenly, they both walked together, went inside, and disappeared under the stage.</p>
<p>After the street dramatist finished the play, he crawled out from under the curtain, holding an old, broken incense tube in his hand to ask the audience for money. The passersby walked away, the children ran even faster, and the women also moved their steps. As a result, only one or two old women were seen taking out copper coins from their waist pouches to give him.</p>
<p>After performing for a long time, he only got one or two copper coins. In this year, the business of street dramatists is also in a slump!</p>
<p>However, the street dramatist did not lose heart. He crawled back under the curtain, and the gongs and drums immediately sounded again, and even added the flute sound of ventriloquism. Characters appeared on the stage again. This time, it was an old man with a white beard. The old man was also turning, singing, and stopping at the right corner of the stage. Then, another character came on stage—this time, also a woman in ancient costume—turning and singing. Again, they both sang, and they both spoke their lines. Again, they both walked together and disappeared under the stage.</p>
<p>This time, the street dramatist still did not get many copper coins, because it was getting late, and he had no choice but to dismantle the stage, pick it up, and leave. From beginning to end, I stood in front of the building watching, and suddenly felt that although performing a one-man show is not that difficult, it is inevitably lonely, depressing, and sad! On the street of life, how can the number of people performing one-man shows be considered small? Who understands their loneliness, depression, and sadness?</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (7)(9)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>She muttered, "It's truly dreadful for a young girl to marry a husband like mine." Jean did not answer. He was thinking about the man he had always thought was his father. Perhaps the vague notion that his father was ordinary had long been in his mind. His brother's constant mockery of their father, others' cold indifference toward him, even the maid's contempt for him, had all prepared his heart for his mother's terrible confession. Because of these reasons, he was not very saddened to learn that he was another man's son. And after the intense emotion of the previous night, the reason why he did not experience the reaction, indignation, and anger that Madame Roland had feared was because he had long been suffering from the feeling that he was the son of this honest fool.</p>
<p>They arrived at Madame Luce-Marie's door.</p>
<p>She lived on the third floor of a large building she owned on the Rue de Sainte-Adresse. From the windows of her apartment, the entire harbor of Le Havre was visible.</p>
<p>When she saw Madame Roland walking in first, she did not extend her hand to shake hands as usual, but opened her arms and embraced her, because she had already guessed her intention.</p>
<p>The magnificent velvet furniture in the living room was always covered with slipcovers. On the wallpapered walls hung four paintings bought by her first husband, the captain. These four paintings all depicted sentimental scenes of the sea. In the first painting, we can see a fisherman's wife waving a handkerchief on the shore, while the sailboat carrying her husband is about to disappear where the sky meets the water. In the second painting, the same woman is kneeling on the same shore, wringing her arms as she gazes into the distance, under a lightning-filled sky, her husband's small boat about to sink in the surging sea. The remaining two paintings depict similar scenes in high society.</p>
<p>A blonde young woman leans her elbow on the railing of an outgoing mail ship, dreaming. With tear-filled eyes, she stares wistfully at the receding shore.</p>
<p>Whom did she leave behind?</p>
<p>Later, the same young woman sits by a window facing the sea, fainting on a sofa. A letter falls from her lap to the carpet.</p>
<p>He is dead, what grief!</p>
<p>Visitors are often moved and seduced by the ordinary sorrows of these clear and poetic themes. People understand the meaning of the paintings at a glance, without explanation or thought, and they pity these poor women, although they are not very clear about the nature of this noblest of sorrows. But this doubt can also help people to imagine. She must have lost her fiancé! Upon entering, people's eyes are involuntarily drawn to these four paintings and are absorbed as if by a temptation. Even when they leave, they always want to turn back and always admire the four expressions of these two women, as if they were sisters. From these bright, proper, thoughtful scenes, as generous as fashionable sculptures, and the shiny frames, one most easily obtains a feeling of cleanliness and rectitude, which is made even more obvious by the rest of the decorations.</p>
<p>The chairs are arranged in an unchanging order, some against the wall and some around a small round table. The spotless white curtains, with such straight and regular folds, almost make people want to wrinkle them slightly. The glass dome of the gilded Empire-style clock—a globe shouldered by kneeling Atlas, as ripe as a melon placed in the room—never gets a speck of dust on it.</p>

<h3>Overview of Our Country's Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>— Dunfu</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, poor politics and chaotic finances have led the central government to rely on issuing domestic debt as its sole method of raising funds. From the beginning of the Republic to the present, a total of fifty-eight types of domestic public bonds and treasury bills with the nature of public bonds have been issued. The former Beijing government issued twenty-eight types, the former Wuhan National Government issued one type, and the Nanjing National Government issued twenty-nine types, with a total issuance amount reaching 1,761,152,782 yuan in national currency. (Please refer to "China's Domestic Public Debt" by Wang Zongpei, which states that as of the end of 1933, after annual repayments and repurchases of 843,404,629.74 yuan, there were thirty-eight types of outstanding public bonds and treasury bills, with a total outstanding principal of 917,748,152.26 yuan in national currency. Furthermore, the "Table of Domestic Debts Without Concrete Guarantees Managed by the Ministry of Finance" compiled and printed by the former Beijing Financial Reorganization Council listed seventy types of other short-term treasury bills, with a total outstanding principal of 40,542,181.82 yuan in national currency. Additionally, the first, second, and third prize-linked public bonds issued by the former Guangdong National Government in 1926, excluding the redeemed principal and canceled tickets, had an actual outstanding amount of 19,086,775.90 silver dollars, which is equivalent to 15,269,420.72 yuan in national currency at an 80% discount. Moreover, the Hankou treasury bills issued during the former Wuhan National Government period amounted to 8,599,053 yuan. The above three items are not included. If combined, the total outstanding amount is 982,158,807.80 silver dollars. The annual changes since the beginning of the Republic are statistically summarized below:</p>

<p>As mentioned above, there are thirty-eight types of outstanding public bonds and treasury bills. Among these thirty-eight types of bonds, except for seven types without concrete guarantees, the funds for the remaining thirty-one types are concretely guaranteed. Specifically, nineteen of them are guaranteed by customs duties, with only the principal and interest of the Haihe Public Bond Patriotic Treasury Bills and the North China Relief War Zone Public Bond, and the principal of the 1931 Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond being specifically designated with other guarantees. As for the interest rates, they were changed according to the "Regulations on Postponement and Reduction of Interest Rates" in February 1932. Except for the Haihe Public Bond, which maintained a monthly interest rate of 8%, and the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bond, which originally had a weekly interest rate of 2.5%, the remaining treasury bills that repay principal and pay interest monthly were changed to a monthly interest rate of 5%, and the bonds that repay principal through lottery were uniformly changed to an annual interest rate of 6%. The repayment methods are broadly divided into two categories: monthly amortization and periodic lottery. The latter is further divided into those that draw lots four times a year and those that draw lots twice a year. As for those that draw lots quarterly, they can be divided into three types according to the lottery month, and those that draw lots semi-annually can also be divided into two types.

<h3>The Shanghai Public Bond Market in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Xinbi</p>
<p>"The ups and downs of the bond market are a barometer of the times." How true this saying is, we have all heard it often. Since 1927, wars and banditry have plagued various regions, disrupting farming and causing commerce to decline. Honest merchants from the interior, forced by circumstances, have moved to Shanghai to reside, and floating capital from various regions has followed. As a result, in recent years, various financial institutions have been flooded with deposits, and speculation in real estate and public bonds has been the only business. Consequently, the public bond market has become increasingly prosperous, with the exchange full of people and speculators in high spirits. Large amounts of public bonds have also been issued year after year. Banks use public bonds as reserves, widely promoting the issuance of banknotes, and the amount issued has increased rapidly. This phenomenon of currency inflation is not fully understood by those involved, and informed observers are deeply concerned about the lurking crisis, wondering what will happen if a storm suddenly arises.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1931, the Yangtze River experienced a major flood, turning various regions along the river into swamps, and the public bond market was the first to be affected. When the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) occurred, bond prices plummeted even further. Then, the January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident) the following year caused financial stagnation again, and the market was closed for three months. After reopening, although the market price gradually stabilized due to the designation of funds, transactions were sparse and could not recover the previous prosperity. In early 1933, the situation remained the same. First, the Japanese army invaded Rehe and eastern Liaoning, followed by the disturbances in Chahar and the Fang Ji Incident, and then the independence of Fujian Province. As a result, although the public bond market for the whole year experienced a surge at the time of the signing of the Tanggu Truce and the success of the U.S. cotton and wheat loan, it eventually saw a sharp decline again due to the country's many misfortunes and the inability to maintain optimism about politics. Fortunately, after the January 28th Incident, few new bonds were issued, the market's chips were exhausted, the money supply eased, and the financial sector gradually bought up the physical holdings of retail investors, which became increasingly scarce. Although the new bonds of the 1931 Disaster Relief and 1931 Finance were put on the market, and 100 million yuan of the 1933 Customs Duty Treasury Bills were issued, the bond market was able to pass safely without being greatly affected. The monthly progress is as follows:</p>
<p>(January) At the beginning of the year, with the sudden invasion of the Japanese army again and the fall of Yuguan, all bonds opened high, but immediately fell by more than one point and trading was suspended, lasting for several days without improvement. Later, due to the proximity of near-term and long-term market prices and the favorable spread interest, a turning point began to appear. In the latter half of the month, due to the chaotic diplomatic situation and the lack of new developments in the military situation against the Japanese army in the north, coupled with the approaching lunar New Year and settlement, all industries were in a period of contraction. Therefore, the market sentiment was very calm, and the bond trend remained sluggish throughout.</p>
<p>(February) After the Spring Festival holiday, the volume of transactions was initially very small. However, as the international situation seemed to be easing slightly, the market sentiment improved. However, large transactions were not seen. Later, the Japanese increased their troop deployment in preparation for invading North China and Rehe, and the atmosphere became tense, and the market sentiment was weak. However, thanks to the active buying by the financial sector, prices were able to be maintained.</p>
<p>(March) When the war in Rehe broke out and Chifeng and Lingyuan were in danger, the bond market, due to the exhaustion of chips and the continued buying by the banking sector, rose steadily day by day. When the American financial turmoil occurred and the discount rates plummeted, the bond market also experienced a period of turbulence. Finally, with a positive market outlook, the market situation was thriving. Later, although rumors about Tianjin resurfaced, the impact was minimal, and it was able to rise gradually.</p>
<p>(April) After the Qingming Festival, news was mixed, and the market was chaotic and volatile. When the war in eastern Liaoning failed and Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, and Xifengkou were successively captured, banks from Guangdong and northern China concentrated on short selling, causing the bond market to decline. As the settlement period approached, the atmosphere suddenly improved, and with the sudden withdrawal of the Japanese army to various passes of the Great Wall, market sentiment soared, and market prices rose sharply day by day.</p>
<p>(May) In early May, news was mixed, and fluctuations were minimal. After the May 9th National Humiliation Day, although rumors were rampant and Tangshan fell and Miyun was under pressure, the market fell repeatedly. When Huang Fu went north, market prices soared. When the war in North China stopped and the voices of peace rose, those who had been pessimistic bought in one after another, especially the banking sector in northern China, which had the strongest appetite.</p>
<p>(June) When the Tanggu Truce was signed, market sentiment was boosted, and market prices soared, with the scale of transactions almost comparable to that before the September 18th Incident. Furthermore, the success of the $50 million U.S. cotton and wheat loan provided a major boost, strengthening investors' confidence. Although the Chahar Incident occurred, new high prices continued to emerge.</p>
<p>(July) After the banks closed their accounts, the buying and selling were quite inconsistent. However, due to the buying by emerging financial institutions and the short covering by northern Chinese banks, market prices continued to rise. The highest record of the year was also generated at this time. However, the market was narrow, and changes would occur if there was a large amount of supply and demand. When the Dalian Conference was successful, the advance was even stronger. When the Chahar Incident worsened, a reaction began. However, the rise and fall were similar to circling, and all parties were looking to the development of the Lushan Conference.</p>
<p>(August) At the beginning of the month, the trend was very unfavorable due to the confusion in the Chahar Incident and the political situation. With rumors of new bonds, the market situation became even more gloomy. When the Chahar Incident took a sharp turn for the worse, there was a sudden sharp rise. Then, a certain party sold gold short, and the Yellow River was also suffering from floods. As a result, large and small investors were highly vigilant, fearing that they would repeat the mistakes of 1931.</p>
<p>(September) In early September, due to the lack of major developments in the situation, the market was sluggish, and buying and selling were scarce. When the Lushan Conference progressed smoothly and the Communist Party and the Kuomintang were slightly more peaceful, the market sentiment was slightly firmer. However, the rumors of new bonds rekindled, and market sentiment appeared even more sluggish and hesitant. Fortunately, the Fang Ji Incident was quickly defeated, and the great upheaval was eliminated without a trace.</p>
<p>(October) The issuance of 100 million yuan of the 1933 Customs Duty Treasury Bills became a reality this month, and the rumors of Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Soong Tzu-wen resigning also arose at this time. However, in terms of transactions, the banking sector absorbed large amounts, so market prices generally rose around the National Day. Later, when there was a plethora of bulls, the market became unstable, and after the banking sector mortgaged the new customs duties, there was a tendency to dump consolidated salt taxes to adjust. When the rumors of Soong Tzu-wen's resignation resurfaced, there was a huge sell-off, and the bond market plummeted. However, at the end of the month, it rose again due to short covering.</p>
<p>(November) At the time of the handover between the old and new finance ministers, market sentiment was fluctuating, rising and falling abruptly. Although no major waves were seen, the future changes were just beginning. Before long, rumors of a political upheaval in Fujian Province suddenly arose, and retail bulls panicked, rushing to sell. The good market situation collapsed, and the low prices of four months ago reappeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>(December) Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the market situation has been extremely chaotic, with constant ups and downs. Then, due to the financial sector and large investors competing to absorb, prices rose sharply for several days. Later, the situation became chaotic, and the market appeared to be circling. Later, as the settlement period approached, short sellers were squeezed, and prices advanced again. With the year-end approaching, the banking sector competed to boost prices to improve their financial statements, and the bond market was supported. However, the war in Fujian and Zhejiang had begun, and the news was mixed, causing another reversal.</p>
<p>The progress of the bond market throughout the year is roughly as described above. The highest and lowest market prices and discounts for spot transactions are shown in the following table (the face value of each public bond market price is originally 100 yuan, so the market price is equal to the discount, and there is no need to list it separately):</p>

<p>In addition to the above 12 types of public bonds and treasury bills, the 7-Year Long-Term, Consolidated 7%, 1931 Finance, 1933 Patriotic Treasury Bills, and the 1932 Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond issued by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were also traded for spot this year, but the number of transactions was very small, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a total of 15 types of bonds are traded for futures, including the above 12 types, as well as the 1931 Finance, 1931 Disaster Relief (no transactions recently), and the 1933 Customs Duty, which is about to be traded. Among these bonds, the salt tax and troop reduction bonds are the most active, with rapid fluctuations, making them the targets of speculators. The 1931 Consolidated Tax and the 1931 Cigarette Tax (commonly known as the Fourth Cigarette Treasury Bills) are second, followed by the demobilization, 1930 Customs Duty, 1930 Rehabilitation, Consolidated 6%, and 1931 Finance bonds, while the transactions of other types are limited.</p>
<h3>Local Public Bonds of Five Provinces and Cities: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Ti Jun</p>
<p>Local public bonds are public bonds issued by the governments of various provinces, cities, and counties. Since the beginning of the Republic, various localities have issued them annually, with more varieties than central domestic bonds. While many are designated for construction projects, a considerable number are raised to cover government financial deficits. Provinces like Sichuan and Guangdong have cleverly created various categories and issued them in large amounts, merely to alleviate current financial difficulties, disregarding the heavy burden they will bear in the future. Due to space limitations, we will first focus on the issuance of local public bonds in the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, to shed light on the situation.</p>
<p>(1) Jiangsu Province.  Jiangsu's provincial public bonds began with the Jiangsu Public Bond of the Republic's early years. After the tenth year of the Republic, there were also various types, such as the Increased Ratio Bonds, Disaster Relief Bonds, Construction Bonds, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Bonds jointly issued with Zhejiang Province. Except for the Increased Ratio Bonds, which have already been repaid or lack reliable guarantees, the other three types are still being repaid with interest on schedule. A brief description follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jiangsu National Branch Treasury Disaster Relief Bonds. This public bond was issued in the eleventh year of the Republic, with a fixed amount of seven million yuan and an annual interest rate of one percent, secured by the province's commodity tax. However, after two principal repayments, it was suspended due to military affairs. In the nineteenth year of the Republic, it was decided to amortize it over twelve years, with seven lots drawn each year. The interest was exempted according to the agreed plan, and the increased price of salt in the five districts of northern Jiangsu and along the Anhui bank was designated as the dedicated funds. Starting from January of the twentieth year of the Republic, the lottery was continued, and so far, eight principal repayments have been made, with forty-two lots drawn, totaling 2.94 million yuan in principal repaid. (2) Jiangsu Province Construction Bonds.  The Construction Bonds were raised to finance various construction projects, also with a fixed amount of seven million yuan. They were issued in two phases in the nineteenth and twentieth years of the Republic, with an annual interest rate of eight percent, using the revenue from the province's pawnshop, field, and housing deed taxes as the fund. So far, six principal repayments have been made, with fourteen lots drawn, totaling 1.4 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(3) Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Bonds of the Twenty-first Year of the Republic. This fund was jointly issued by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with a fixed amount of three million yuan, specifically for the relief of the silk cocoon industry in both provinces. It was designated to be allocated from the funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the two provinces for cutting down on likin taxes, and the interest rate was six percent per annum. Since its issuance in November of the twenty-first year of the Republic, five principal repayments have been made, with thirty-one lots drawn, totaling 930,000 yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(2) Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang Province began issuing public bonds with the Patriotic Public Bond of the military government in the early years of the Republic. After the twelfth year, eight more types of fixed-term loans were continuously issued, including the Post-Settlement, Debt Consolidation, Debt Repayment, Highway, Construction, Disaster Relief, Debt Clearing, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Bonds jointly issued with Jiangsu Province. Except for those that have been cleared or recovered, the following seven types have not been cleared. Furthermore, due to the exhaustion of financial resources in the winter of the twentieth year, a reorganization was carried out, designating four types of tax revenue as a debt repayment fund: the province's salt surtax, land tax with construction surtax, special surtax, and ordinary business tax, allocating 4.4 million yuan of silver annually.</p>
<p>(1) Zhejiang Province Old Debt Repayment Bonds. This bond was issued in the seventeenth year of the Republic to repay various military expenses borrowed internally and externally since the military uprisings of the fifteenth and sixteenth years. The fixed amount was six million yuan, with a weekly interest rate of one percent. Repayment began in the fourth year, and so far, five principal repayments have been made, with twenty-three lots drawn, totaling 1.38 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(2) Zhejiang Province Highway Bonds. The Highway Bonds were also issued in the seventeenth year of the Republic, with a fixed amount of 2.5 million yuan, used for the construction of provincial highways. The interest rate was one percent per week. Since their issuance, eleven principal repayments have been made, with forty-three lots drawn, totaling 1.075 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(3) Zhejiang Province Construction Bonds of the Eighteenth Year of the Republic.  The Construction Bonds were raised in the eighteenth year of the Republic, with a fixed amount of ten million yuan, used for the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway, the expansion of the electricity business, and the dredging of the Qiantang River water conservancy. The annual interest rate was eight percent. Principal repayments have been made eight times, with thirty-one lots drawn, totaling 3.1 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(4) Zhejiang Province Disaster Relief Bonds of the Nineteenth Year of the Republic. In the summer and autumn of the eighteenth year, floods, droughts, and pests ravaged Zhejiang Province. The Civil Affairs Department, considering the severity of the disaster, requested the provincial government to issue disaster relief bonds of one million yuan, with an annual interest rate of eight percent, starting in July of the nineteenth year. So far, seven principal repayments have been made, with twenty-four lots drawn, totaling 240,000 yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(5) Zhejiang Province Old Debt Clearing Bonds of the Twentieth Year of the Republic. In the summer of the twentieth year of the Republic, the Zhejiang provincial government, in order to clear the accumulated debts and loans due to budget deficits in recent years, issued Old Debt Clearing Bonds of eight million yuan, with an annual interest rate of eight percent. To date, five principal repayments have been made, with twelve lots drawn, totaling 960,000 yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(6) Zhejiang Province Short-Term Treasury Bills of the Twenty-First Year of the Republic. The Provincial Treasury Bills were issued in July of the twenty-first year of the Republic, with the aim of compensating for budget deficits. The fixed amount was six million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of five percent. As of the end of the twenty-second year, two principal repayments have been made, totaling 480,000 yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(7) Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Bonds of the Twenty-First Year of the Republic. This fund was jointly issued with Jiangsu Province, as detailed above, and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>(3) Nanjing City. In October of the eighteenth year of the Republic, the Nanjing Municipal Government, in order to build the capital's waterworks project and construct residential housing for citizens, issued the Nanjing City Special Construction Bonds of the Eighteenth Year of the Republic for three million yuan, with an annual interest rate of eight percent, using the city's vehicle donation revenue and city property income as the principal and interest repayment fund. To date, lottery repayments have been carried out nine times, with forty-five lots drawn, totaling 1.35 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai City. Shanghai City's issuance of public bonds began with the Road Administration Reorganization Bonds of the eleventh year of the Republic. Subsequently, two more types of bonds were issued: the Bridge and Road Reorganization Bonds and the Yu Garden Bonds. After the establishment of the Municipal Government, two types of bonds were issued successively: the Municipal Bonds and the Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Bonds. This public bond was issued in October of the eighteenth year of the Republic, with a fixed amount of three million yuan, used for the construction of main roads and the city center area, the establishment of a municipal bank, and the reorganization of various old public bonds. The annual interest rate was eight percent, secured by the city's housing donation revenue. Since the lottery in the twentieth year of the Republic, six principal repayments have been made, with forty-two lots drawn, totaling 1.26 million yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds. After the January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident), various tax revenues were reduced. The municipal authorities, with the approval of the National Government, issued public bonds of six million yuan for the purpose of repairing roads, bridges, and ditches in the disaster area and carrying out other reconstruction and relief matters. The annual interest rate was seven percent, with dock revenue designated as the fund. The bonds were underwritten by the Shanghai British firm Lyan Foreign Firm, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was entrusted to handle the principal and interest. The municipal government actually received 80% of the face value. Since the issuance in November of the twenty-first year of the Republic, two principal repayments have been made, with two lots drawn, totaling 120,000 yuan in principal repaid.</p>
<p>(5) Hangzhou City. Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, in order to build a waterworks plant, issued public bonds of 2.5 million yuan in July of the nineteenth year of the Republic, named Zhejiang Province Hangzhou City Waterworks Public Bonds, with an annual interest rate of eight percent, secured by the city's land tax revenue and the operating surplus of the waterworks plant. Only 1.5 million yuan was issued in the nineteenth year, and another 500,000 yuan was subsequently issued in the twenty-second year. The first principal repayment was made in December of the twenty-second year of the Republic, with one lot drawn, repaying 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above five provinces and cities issued a total of thirteen types of local public bonds, including two types in Jiangsu Province, six types in Zhejiang Province, one type jointly issued by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, one type in Nanjing City, two types in Shanghai City, and one type in Hangzhou City. The current outstanding principal is highest in Zhejiang Province, totaling 27.3 million yuan of silver (the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Short-Term Bonds are calculated as half for each province). Jiangsu Province is second, with 10.695 million yuan. Shanghai City is next, with 7.62 million yuan of silver. Hangzhou City has 1.98 million yuan, and Nanjing City has the least, with only 1.65 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The London Market for Chinese Bonds</h3>
<p>— Jian Chu</p>
<p>The Chinese bonds traded on the London Stock Exchange can be divided into two major categories: one is bonds issued for central government loans, including the Anglo-German Continuation Loan guaranteed by customs duties, the Post-Settlement Grand Loan, the Crisp Loan guaranteed by salt tax, the Anglo-French Loan, the Hukuang Railway Loan, and the Sino-French Bonds guaranteed by the Boxer Indemnity. The other is railway loans, mostly guaranteed by railway assets and operating income, including several types such as the Peining, Shanghai-Nanjing, Guangzhou-Kowloon, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, Tianjin-Pukou Continuation, Longhai, and Daokou-Qinghua.</p>
<p>Over the years, China has been plagued by internal strife and frequent foreign invasions. The financial resources have been exhausted, and there is no alchemic solution. Although efforts have been made to maintain the credit of overseas bonds, it is precarious and in danger of collapse. Delays in the payment of principal and interest at maturity have been a frequent occurrence. Railway bonds, due to frequent military disturbances affecting railway administration, the appropriation of railway funds, and the destruction of operating income, have also seen their creditworthiness shaken. The interest of foreigners in Chinese foreign bonds has gradually decreased.</p>
<p>Currently, in the London market, the face value of Chinese foreign bonds, except for the Sino-French gold bonds, which are 500 US dollars, is mostly 100 British pounds. However, due to China's financial difficulties and financial exhaustion, the London market price of foreign bonds, except for the Anglo-German Continuation Loan, which has a better performance, is far from the face value. This is also sufficient to prove the declining interest of foreigners in Chinese foreign bonds. However, the financial authorities, recognizing the urgent need to restore creditworthiness, have spared no effort in reorganization and turnover. Therefore, in the past year, Chinese foreign bonds in London have been firm. From August to September, central government foreign debt suddenly showed a positive trend, rising by 4 to 10 pounds. Railway bonds also suddenly turned bullish from September to October. However, Marconi &amp; Vickers, as well as the Peining and Guangzhou-Kowloon railway bonds, have been stagnant since November of the previous year, so there are no market records. The following table lists the highest and lowest market prices of Chinese foreign bonds in London last year for reference.</p>

<h3>The Silver Market in the Financial Week Becomes More Tranquil</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver interest rates, both in the morning and afternoon, remained at seven percent, with an addition of water after the line. Because it was Sunday, banks were closed, so there was no clearing or discounting of bills. The turnover of accounts and new transactions in the morning market was over 4.6 million. Bank collections were suspended as usual. The amount of silver collected by Qianzhuang (money shops) on public bills was over 37 million. There were no reports of remittances coming in or going out. Remittances from various routes amounted to over 300,000. Silver pledge transactions amounted to over 400,000. In the subsidiary currency market, the price of Jiangnan small silver coins fell by five yuan in the morning market, to 825 yuan, but recovered in the afternoon market to the original price of 830 yuan, with 5,000 jiao (1 jiao = 1/10 yuan) transacted in the morning market and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 790 yuan in the morning market and 791.5 yuan in the afternoon market, a good 3.5 yuan better than the previous afternoon. Transactions amounted to 65,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins increased by 500 wen, to 295,000 wen. Transactions amounted to over 37,700 strings, with a value of 12,800 yuan of silver.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Market Has a Bright Outlook in the First Week of This Year</h3>
<p>|| Overall Increase of 2-3 Jiao to 1 Yuan ||</p>
<p>During the past week, from January 1st to 6th, the China Merchants Securities Exchange, for the first week of the 23rd year, only conducted three days of trading due to the New Year holiday. Although the market experienced a four-day suspension, there were no major changes. Although there were slight advances and retreats in the Fujian-Zhejiang war, it was not a major factor. Hu Hanmin telegraphed for a ceasefire, which was not accepted by the central government. All disputes will be resolved in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Therefore, the outcome of the Fourth Plenary Session, or the outcome of the Fujian Incident, is closely related to the rise and fall of public bonds. Whether there will be changes in the political situation, whether all parties can unite, and whether the Southwest and Hu can attend, and whether the meeting can be held without further delay, are all closely related to the rise and fall of public bonds. The government's finances are therefore even more insufficient. Therefore, another 100 million yuan of 22nd-year customs treasury bonds have been issued, and trading began on the first day of the New Year, which was last Thursday. The initial market price was 60 yuan, which inevitably caused the problem of excessive supply. Furthermore, due to the chaotic news from the front lines, the public was quite wary after the market opened, and large investors sold off, causing the market price to fall uniformly by several jiao to one yuan. On Friday, due to the victory in the battle at the front, although large investors sold off, there was a surge of small-scale short covering and buying for delivery on the 11th, causing the market price to rise uniformly by 3-4 jiao to one yuan. On Saturday, the news was still quite positive. Although the 21st issue continued to be sold, there was still strong demand from retail investors, and the short positions in the 75th issue were heavily covered. The market price recovered after weakening and rose again by 1-2 jiao to one yuan. The new customs bonds of the 22nd year rose sharply by 2 yuan. As a result, the market price increased by 2-3 jiao to over one yuan compared to the end of the year, with the Jin Chang bonds rising the most, by 1.1 yuan. This public bond is due for its first lottery in March, so its upward trend is particularly strong. The total volume of transactions was 45,213,000 yuan.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market in Hexia (Shanghai) Shows a Weakening Trend</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The supply from various sources is suddenly scarce. It is estimated that over ten boats of late rice (over 2,000 shi) and over twenty boats of thick japonica rice and various colors (over 3,000 shi) arrived. The initial market for late rice packages was unusually quiet. It was not until near noon that Tanggu and other gangs began to purchase over 1,000 packages. Therefore, the market conditions remained flat, and prices showed no gains or losses. The thick japonica rice and Duyang long-grain rice from various sources that were delivered to retail stores were slow to sell. The higher-quality rice was able to maintain its price, but the mid- to lower-quality rice saw a slight softening of several cents to nearly a jiao. The price of Yin Yuan rice for distribution was similar, and the market color turned stable.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: New Guangdong Raw Sugar Falls Another Four Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market remained weak. The guild quoted 19 yuan 2 jiao for No. 24 raw sugar and white initial sugar, but there were no buyers. Later, it was traded at 1.5 jiao, down 5 fen from the previous day. Re-exported goods fell by 1 jiao. Dutch red No. 8 was quoted at 15 yuan 2 jiao, No. 9 at 15 yuan 4 jiao. Taikoo Sugar fell slightly by 4-5 fen. B Mark was 20 yuan, CW Mark 19 yuan 8.5 jiao, DY Mark 19 yuan 6 jiao, and HX Mark 19 yuan 3 jiao. The factory's own refined white No. 1 opened at 18 yuan 2 jiao, down another 1 jiao from the previous day, with the rest following the decline. New Guangdong Raw Sugar was slightly available, with signs of continued loosening. Over 90 packages of New Guangdong Raw Sugar were opened yesterday, falling by 4 jiao to a price of 11 yuan 8 jiao. The previous number of Five Blessings White Ice Sugar was intended to be increased, but since raw white and red sugars have all fallen recently, although the supply of Gaojian Ice Sugar is not large, it is difficult to be uniquely popular. Therefore, yesterday, 100+ boxes were opened at the original price of 18 yuan 2 jiao.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>War and Youth</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Although Henderson, the veteran Labour leader of England, is rushing around day and night putting on his "Goodyear"-like rubbery face for "disarmament" and "peace," not only has "military expansion" become a race of fierce competition between the imperialist powers, but also the approaching crisis of a second world war is almost common knowledge. The Near East, specifically Germany, and the Far East, specifically China, have long been recognized as the two major "volcanoes" where international dangers and contradictions converge. Now, these two remotely opposing "volcanoes" are both spewing out terrifying heat and thick smoke, and a major eruption is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Of course, the Wall Street financiers, the "big shots," the Mitsui and Mitsubishi tycoons, will not be personally present on the front lines when the bloody scene of a world war unfolds. And as usual, it will be the international youth masses who are "doomed" and coerced and lured to the front lines to be cannon fodder and targets for shooting practice!</p>
<p>Look! Deluded by the dream that "war can restore prosperity," the imperialists, in their stroke-induced frenzy, are pushing the male and female youth of their respective countries toward the great calamity of war as if afraid of falling behind:</p>
<p>(1) United Press Tokyo Cable: The Japanese military has designated 1935 as the year for foreign wars... The Army Ministry's Conscription Section (responsible for matters related to recruiting stations) has formulated new guidelines to reform military training methods in schools. Strict combat training will be applied to 1,418 universities and specialized schools across the country, with a total of 734,602 students...</p>
<p>(1) Domei News Agency Tokyo Cable: The Japan Women's Federation and the Japan United Women's Youth Group, feeling that the male's emergency training is insufficient, are mobilizing all 20 million female members across the country to launch an emergency women's training movement... with 1936 as the target, they will begin practical military life training.</p>
<p>(1) Kokumin News Agency Berlin Cable: It is known that 1.5 million German youth movement members, all between the ages of ten and eighteen, from major cities have been examined by doctors on the orders of Chancellor Hitler. Among them, 60,000 were sent to the countryside for training due to their weak physical condition... In addition, 1,500 boys and girls were sent to youth sanatoriums because they were too weak. The government has decided to pay close attention to the health of the nation's youth...</p>
<p>(1) Reuters Rome Cable: In order to promote Italy's birth rate, the Fascist Party has designated October 30th as "Marriage Day." At that time, 2,000 couples will hold weddings. After the ceremony, they will march in a procession to the headquarters of the Opera Nazionale Balilla (National Balilla Organization) to receive gifts from Prime Minister Mussolini. At the same time, a mass baptism ceremony for infants will be held in St. Peter's Church, and the Prime Minister will present each person with a suit of clothing. Moreover, Mussolini recently gave a speech at a youth rally, saying that 1934 will be a "year of misfortune" for Italian bachelors, meaning that the government will impose heavy taxes on those who do not marry.</p>
<p>From the above recent news, we can see that the Japanese imperialists have already made the majority of the nation's young men and women a "reservation for cannon fodder." Hitler is very concerned about the "health" of German youth, but if we link this "concern" with his previous speeches demanding that all German youth obey the guidance of the National Socialist Party, as well as his bellicose policies of stubbornly demanding equality in German armaments in the League of Nations, we can see that Hitler's main effort is also to "cannon fodderize" German youth. Italian imperialism is not only busy with air force competition, busy manufacturing warships and cannons, but also busy manufacturing "second-generation cannons"!</p>
<p>The above facts fully illustrate to us that in the coming imperialist world war, it is the international youth masses who will be directly sacrificed and suffer the most. Therefore, since the European War, the progressive youth masses of various countries have continuously engaged in heroic struggles against imperialist war for their own interests. The Soviet Union, which is in a position of opposition to the imperialist world and is constantly subject to imperialist attacks, recently had its top leader give a speech, warning the five million members of the Youth League, on the one hand, to prepare to defend the country by force, and on the other hand, warning the enemies who are attempting a counter-Soviet war: "Do not test our strength, or you will burn yourselves!" It can be seen that countries or colonial nations in a position of opposition to imperialism can only guarantee peace and their own security under the state of armed self-defense and vigilance, and must never pray or plead for peace to the demons whose profession is slaughter! As for Chinese youth, in the current stage of the world war where "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the tower," at the very least, they should have the following two understandings and grasps:</p>
<p>First, the Pacific War is a war for the imperialists to re-divide the Chinese market. At that time, China will not only not be able to maintain the illusion of "internal neutrality" or rely on a certain imperialist belligerent country to seek temporary survival, but the entire coastline and most of the land will inevitably become a battlefield for imperialist massacres.</p>
<p>Second, in the imperialist war, no matter who wins or loses, China will only sink further into colonization, and there will never be another opportunity like the Paris Peace Conference to complain and seek redress. Therefore, for the survival of themselves and the nation, Chinese youth have no other way out except to engage in an anti-imperialist national war to reduce imperialist war!</p>
<h3>Notes on Attending a Performance by the Tuosheng Drama Society</h3>
<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>On the afternoon of New Year's Eve last year, my friend Lin Xijun invited me to see "Vanity Mistake" at the Great Shanghai Theater. When we walked to the entrance of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, there was a large banner hanging in the rehearsal of Shuangxi with the words "First Grand Performance of the Tuosheng Drama Society." Another advertisement board said that the play being performed was "Beyond the Horizon." I remembered that the "Tuosheng Drama Society" was a drama group of students from the Fine Arts School that participated in the "Anti-Japanese Drama Grand Alliance" after the "September 18th Incident" the previous year. The results of their performance at that time gave me a good impression, and I really wanted to go in and see it. The script they were performing was "Beyond the Horizon," which is a masterpiece by the famous American playwright Eugene O'Neill, and I thought I had to go in and see it even more. But then I saw an advertisement board that said "Tickets can be purchased at the tobacco shop across the street." I thought that I had never paid to see a drama before, and this time I was afraid I would have to spend some money. Suddenly, I saw the movie star Zheng Junli and the director Su Yi walking out from inside, followed by two young ladies. After we greeted each other, I asked them if they had bought tickets. They said they went in with Zhou Bodong. Just as they were talking, I saw Zhou push his fat body down the stone steps like moving Mount Tai. By chance, I asked him how he got in. He said that Zhao Dan was inside looking for them. I had an idea. But I heard that it was organized by students from Guohua Middle School. Oh well, no matter who organized it, I had to see "Beyond the Horizon." I said goodbye to them and hurried to the Great Shanghai Theater next door to find my friend Lin, who was waiting for me to see the movie. While watching the movie, I was still thinking about how to go in and see "Beyond the Horizon."</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, after leaving the Great Shanghai Theater, I hurried to the Da Sanyuan Restaurant to eat. After dinner, Lin left. I hurried towards Tibet Road. It was convenient – it was even more polite – to say hello to the doorman and tell them that I was looking for Mr. Zhao Dan. They invited me into the theater and said he was backstage. I knew that place well, so I went backstage. I entered the door, which was the dressing room. I asked, "Is Mr. Zhao Dan here?" Someone called Mr. Zhao out. Mr. Zhao accompanied me out of the theater and asked the usher to entertain me. He said he was busy backstage and went in. I asked the usher for a program and was led to a vacant seat in the third row from the front. Next to me was a lady. I thought that probably no one was sitting there because of that lady. I was really taking advantage of her. By this time the play had already started. On stage, there was a rural scene. Two men were sitting on a low wall talking. One man was wearing long</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>black leather boots and holding a rake, like a foreign farmer. The other man was wearing ordinary casual clothes, without black leather boots or a rake, like a student. I knew that they were brothers, and this was only the beginning of the first act. As I watched, the two brothers just kept sitting on the low wall and talking to each other. It was really too monotonous and a bit tiresome. When the older brother, Alan, left and a beautiful girl came on stage, the faces of the audience all changed to an excited expression. I myself also perked up and paid close attention. But the girl, Ruth, was also sitting opposite the student, Andrew, on the low wall. The student had previously told his farmer brother that he was determined to leave the farm and go to sea, but now when the beautiful girl said that she loved him, he said that he would not go to sea. The two kissed. "In heaven, may we be two birds flying wing to wing; on earth, may we be two trees with intertwined branches." The kiss was fake, I could see, but they did it so realistically. I admired them. This young couple went down behind the low wall, and the first act closed.</p>
<p>After the first act closed, the time it took to change the scenery was so long, and there was no music to soothe the audience's anxious hearts as they waited. As a result, the sound of conversation arose from all sides, and the whole theater was noisy. I was blaming the host – the Tuosheng Drama Society – for why they didn't have an orchestra? Otherwise, they could have at least played a phonograph. At the same time, I was reminded that although the audience for spoken drama is mostly from academic circles, and they are all educated intellectuals, it is still difficult to get everyone to wait patiently in serious silence during the scene change. Future drama practitioners should pay attention to this point and add music. Moreover, that music should best suit the plot of the closed act and transition into the plot of the upcoming act, which is helpful for the progress of the drama.</p>
<p>As soon as the second act opened, the audience immediately became quiet. On stage was the scene of a poor foreign family. In the center was a round table surrounded by three foreigners. In the middle was an old woman, on her left was an old man, and on her right was a half-clownish, pot-bellied businessman. Behind the pot-bellied businessman, standing in the corner, was Alan, the farmer brother from the first act. The people around the round table were talking about the young man who wanted to go to sea. The father and mother were opposed to it, but the uncle, the pot-bellied businessman, was encouraging him to go, saying how good it would be to have one son farming at home and one going to sea to do business. After a while, Andrew, the younger brother, came in and told his mom and dad that he was not going. Andrew wasn't going to sea, and his mom and dad were happy, but the reason he wasn't going was because Ruth loved him, and he was willing to farm at home and not seek the ideal "beyond the horizon." The father was extremely angry: Alan, who knows how to farm, wants to leave, and Andrew, who doesn't know how to farm, how will he take responsibility? The dad was extremely angry and blamed him, but the seafaring merchant uncle was happy that he had prepared a cabin for Andrew, and now Alan could live in it just the same. In this act, the performances of each character were very capable of expressing the personality of the characters in the play and the actions in the plot; the two old men especially did well.

<h3>The Premonition of Suicide</h3>
<p>— Maifu</p>
<p>|| Reply to Brother Gongbai's Question ||</p>
<p>You asked me in your letter for my opinion on suicide, brother, please listen:</p>
<p>Most people think that although suicide is strange and frightening, it is nevertheless great. Because suicide is painful, and sacrificing life is the most difficult thing. Yet some people are able to resolutely decide to give up their youthful lives and wholeheartedly die to end the troubles of life. This cannot be achieved without a kind of great understanding and great courage. Therefore, there is a spirit of great and admirable decisiveness hidden within, and those who are greedy for life and afraid of death are clearly beyond comparison.</p>
<p>These people believe that most people are greedy for life, and that strong consciousness of life is difficult to compare to the courage of suicide. They believe that a person's thoughts about life, if they can be treated so resolutely, are great no matter what.</p>
<p>This kind of statement is only close to the truth. If we examine it carefully, we can see the poverty of its reasoning.</p>
<p>I feel that a person can only express his greatness in life, because life is living, and a person's greatness is purely built on struggling with a hard life with vitality.</p>
<p>Death, sometimes I do not deny that it is great, but that is limited to a certain range. For example, for the sake of dedicating oneself to society, for the sake of dedicating oneself to humanity, when the result is of great significance, it is great. If it is only for the sake of one's own hard life or for the troubles of love, ending oneself with suicide, no matter how you say it, it is not considered great, nor is it considered brave.</p>
<p>Why can't you fight with hardship? Why don't you step over the troubles and open up your way forward?</p>
<p>The meaning of life can only be found in the continuation of the physical body and the struggle of life. Because the current society is full of darkness and flaws, naturally every life will encounter some unsatisfactory things, but this is precisely the place to hone our human greatness. We must build steadfastness, excellence, courage, and other great qualities from human nature. These unsatisfactory things, that is, all kinds of troubles in life, cannot be rejected or avoided. What is a brave person? A brave person is someone who sheds tears, clenches their teeth, and steps through pain, annoyance, hardship, and hardship! Only these people are worthy of being called great, and only they are worthy of our utmost praise.</p>
<p>As for those who commit suicide, they are incompetent and cowardly.</p>
<p>Why are they incompetent and cowardly? Simply put, it is because they do not have the resolute spirit to fight against hardship and boredom. We believe that someone who steals to maintain his child's life is a hundred times greater than someone who commits suicide. Why? Because he recognizes life, he recognizes the true meaning of life. He recognizes the flaws of this society, and he wants to express the greatness of that humanity from the flaws of this society. This is naturally incomparable to those who commit suicide, who use death to cover up their cowardice, and use death to avoid the struggle against hardship.</p>
<p>So I feel that even if you have to die, you should die at the hands of the enemy. For example, if you are suffering from economic oppression, you go and duel with the one who oppresses you, but the enemy sentences you to death. For example, if you are heartbroken, you use force to seize the woman's heart and body. If you cannot, you kill her and then let the enemy kill you. As for committing suicide because you cannot beat the enemy, this kind of person should be spurned by all.</p>
<p>Enough nonsense, take care.</p>

<h3>In Poverty, Cultivate One's Own Morality</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Since I was young, I have been determined to study diligently, and for ten years I have never been lazy. I have cultivated my character and conduct, hoping to establish myself; I have cherished friends and reputation, wanting to serve the world one day. Since graduating from middle school, I have served my hometown for seven years; suddenly I was troubled by illness, and I have been bedridden for six months. I barely survived, but one of my feet was crippled. Walking is staggering, like a cripple. This is not only a betrayal of the sincere enthusiasm for learning, but also a great betrayal of the parents' and teachers' intention to nurture me. Turning my thoughts to the future, it is difficult to establish myself. I think all day long to find a way to escape this deep abyss of darkness, but I cannot find a way. A friend, Mr. Wei, showed me the way forward, saying, "Since ancient times, those who could not realize their ambitions, and could not deeply and clearly show their views in action, retreated to writing books and writing books to express their anger, thinking of leaving empty texts to show themselves. For example, Zuoqiu lost his sight, but he had the Guoyu; Sunzi's knees were cut off, but the Art of War was compiled; Zichang was sentenced, and the Records of the Grand Historian shone through the ages. Why don't you follow their example, master one art, engage in commentary, and wouldn't that shock the world and leave a name for posterity? If you don't plan for this, in this world of natural selection and the survival of the fittest, even those with strong bodies can hardly avoid the sigh of unemployment and panic; how can you, with a disabled body, hope to stand on your own?" At that time, Ye Jun was beside him, and without waiting for me to answer, he stood up and retorted, saying, "Why are you so ignorant of the times and blind to things? Specialize in one art and write books and theories. In ancient times when material competition was slower, it was feasible. In today's world where competition for survival is fierce, it seems difficult to do. We are busy running around for food and clothing, and we don't have enough money and time to meet this noble requirement. In my opinion, a disabled body is truly incompetent to take on a task! Gu Liu Jun is disabled but not useless, and he can still work as usual. He has served at the Shinaan Elementary School for almost two years, and he has never neglected his career. You can see this generally. Don't you see the great man of the party and the state, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang? Mr. Zhang's body was disabled in order to resist the Qing Dynasty. Compared with Liu Jun, the degree of his disability is almost worse. However, his achievements are as brilliant as the sun and stars. Haven't you heard of the current President of the United States, Roosevelt? Roosevelt also suffered from leg disease before, and he recovered after a long time and engaged in a political career. Now he is the pillar of the American recovery. Therefore, Liu Jun, although he has suffered from this disease, don't feel inferior to yourself because of this, lose your ambition, hinder your ambition, be determined to be successful, and persevere and you will be successful." After Ye Jun finished speaking, everyone present happily agreed. At that time, I had already lost my mind and did not know what to do. Both are exaggerated and their words are very high, but they fail to meet my</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>current requirements. What I want to know most at the moment is whether I can serve the world and take on important work; the scope is not only limited to the meaning of his personal and family life, containing all the pleasure-seeking aspirations of individualism; but also to exert willpower, sacrifice and struggle for the public, and improve the country and society, so as not to fail the duties of a citizen. All these tasks, the strong men with modern thoughts, can of course achieve their goals gradually. If I, with a disabled body, take on this task, what kind of difficulties will occur; or if I immediately shirk responsibility because of difficulties and live my life in vain? From now on, I will be attached to the ranks of idleness and spend my days in peace. This is what is called cultivating one's own morality in poverty? But I see this kind of selfish and self-interested view as negative individualism, which is no different from entering a nursing home or a disabled person's home. I vow not to sacrifice my years in a land of nothingness, but am willing to give up the obligations of modern people. All the ideal societies that I have admired in the past, and the Three People's Principles that I sincerely admired, I don't want to abandon them casually under any cost or environment, so that the brainpower, hard work, and hopes that I have spent in the past will be swept away by the raging wind and waves. However, I want to participate in the above work, not without a plan, without confidence, reference to past experience, and research experience, there is absolute possibility of realization. Only because I lack confidence in my body, and suspect how the attitude of objective people towards me, will make me linger, stop and not move forward, and waste time, which is a pity! In order to remedy the past defects, and determine the future path of struggle, and to investigate the attitude of objective people towards me, I hereby write a letter to</p>
<p>Your esteemed platform, please provide detailed guidance, so that it can serve as a compass for the future, and I will be grateful! Sincerely, I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Teaching auspiciousness Liu Xingchuan bowed (1, 4,)</p>
<p>Editor's note: If a person is unfortunately afflicted with disability, the entire society should contribute its common living resources to support and nurture him. Moreover, he is still able to seek to cultivate his own morality? Where can he be blamed for not fulfilling his responsibilities? Therefore, the sage allows people to cultivate their own morality in poverty. However, poverty means lack of strength; those who lack strength stand in the middle, not self-imposed. Liu Jun's illness does not seem to hinder his work, so he should continue to move forward as before. It is better to give up halfway, then you can be blameless. If you stop because of a small illness, it is suicide. People will not forgive you. As for establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words, they are originally immortal undertakings that lead to the same goal through different paths. Even those who are strong and healthy must consider whether their nature and environment are suitable for them to decide whether to take or give up. Liu Jun can choose one to do it.</p>

<h3>Notes from Prison ㈢</h3>
<p>— Cheshu</p>
<p>Today I wrote a letter to my sister and her friends saying:</p>
<p>"Love is not the satisfaction of flesh and spirit, but perhaps it is both, but the highest meaning is satisfied mutual assistance between both parties!" Because they are probably talking about love.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the amount of food brought from home. If one person eats it, of course it seems like a lot, but after sharing some with Di Jun and Hua Jun, almost all of it was gone. Only the chicken in the dried vegetables, I kept for myself. Today is Sunday, and all five of them are in the cell. Some odds and ends of eggs and meat were also shared. All that's left is the chicken. Of course, I've been looking forward to this for a long, long time. It's not much, and if six people split it up, even the last bit of skin would be gone. In prison, everyone is eager to eat. Last spring, what was brought I ate with Hua - at that time I was in the same room with him - at that time we both had problems with our stomachs, but we didn't care - now of course I don't want to give it all to them.</p>
<p>When I first came in, the gluttony of the inmates disgusted me; one of them, when his stomach was a little better, my family sent things, he had been sick for several years, and it was rare to use various methods to get better - but he ate so much, he devoured more than healthy people, and when he ate meat, his mouth full of saliva often made me nauseous.</p>
<p>Although I didn't eat, they were even more pitiful, and of course I couldn't bear to eat alone, but if I gave it to one, I had to give it to the rest; so I didn't give the chicken at all!</p>
<p>They had already eaten some eggs and meat in the morning, and if I gave them more in the afternoon, I would have to wait for the chicken; so I peeled three eggs, poured some soy sauce, and picked some dried vegetables from the chicken to give them. I was doing this when I heard - "Hum, playing tricks!" "What playing tricks?" I asked Lao Chang, still not understanding, but he didn't answer.</p>
<p>When it was time to eat, everyone else still ate a little, but Lao Chang didn't eat, and then I understood the meaning of what "playing tricks" referred to.</p>
<p>This is how prisoners without money treat political prisoners with money. They want everything from political prisoners to be public, because if it's not public, these people will act this way. Most people are like this, so they hope this will happen with general political prisoners - therefore, my being stingy with the chicken is considered inappropriate by them, and they are angry because their hopes for me have been dashed.</p>
<p>Four people went out to pour water and spittoons, and Lao Han and I stayed behind - "Don't be polite to us with the things you get during visitation!" Lao Han said to me. I was drying clothes at the time, just paying attention to the clothesline outside the window and the moving things, so I didn't pay attention to him, but my heart churned with sadness for a while.</p>

<h3>The German Film Industry After the Persecution of Jews as Seen by an American</h3>
<h3>Diverse Perspectives</h3>
<p>Since the rise of National Socialism in Germany and the implementation of one-party rule, the party leader, Hitler, after suppressing the Communist Party, also initiated a wave of anti-Semitism. Jews were not only barred from holding government positions, but also from entering any prestigious profession. Consequently, Jews who were formerly university professors, doctors, lawyers, etc., in Germany were all dismissed and unemployed. Many, unable to live peacefully in the country, had to flee abroad. The number of such Jews who escaped to France, Poland, Russia, and other countries is countless. These Jews, originally a people without a homeland, were now being discriminated against and subjected to all kinds of humiliation by the German National Socialist Party, truly as pitiful as homeless dogs.</p>
<p>The film industry in Germany is also a part of the nation's cultural undertakings. Since all cultural affairs in the country have come under the control of Hitler's dictatorship, cinema has naturally become a part of state-managed enterprises. Therefore, the German film industry would certainly not allow Jews to have any part in it. However, Jews in the German film industry, much like in the United States, accounted for a large proportion of personnel and financial resources. After the German film industry, under Fascist rule, excluded the Jews, it naturally revealed signs of exhaustion in terms of talent and economy. As a result, it had no choice but to invest and subsidize through the state on the one hand, and use coercive measures to recall German stars and technicians from abroad on the other.</p>
<p>The reasons touted by Hitler were not without eloquence, speaking of rebuilding the culture of the motherland and so on, but in reality, it would be better not to harm the cultural enterprise than to talk about rebuilding it. Because Jews are a people without a homeland; in America, they are Americans, and in Germany, they are Germans, equally loyal to the country and dedicated to society, without the need for discrimination and exclusion.</p>
<p>According to American estimates, since Germany removed the Jews, the film industry has shrunk by half. A woman born in America but raised in Germany, named Fern Andra, said: "In Germany, almost all the male and female actors who have glorious achievements on the screen are either of Jewish descent or have at least some Jewish connection. Now that they have eliminated the Jews, what is left in the film industry, I find it hard to imagine. Producers, directors, writers… they are all Jews. Even in America, the group of famous people who came from Germany, like Laemmle, Lubitsch, Freund, Pommer, Stern, Dupont, Dieterle, they are all outstanding Jews. These people have made great contributions to the American film industry, but Germany does not want them back because they are not of pure Aryan descent."</p>
<p>Fern Andra, because she married a German nobleman, is a baroness. She used to run a photography studio in Germany, but it is now closed because, since the Jews were expelled, Germany can hardly find pure Aryan German directors, screenwriters, etc., to support her work. This shows the difficulties faced by all other film companies in Germany after the anti-Jewish wave.</p>
<p>Moreover, after Hitler excludes all the Jews, can he gather a group of pure Germans to make completely German films? If we examine past events, we can see that this is not easy to achieve. Were those stars who made German films famous in the world all pure Germans? Emil Jannings's father was an American, and he himself was born in Brooklyn, east of New York. Pola Negri is Polish. Vilma Banky is Hungarian. Anna Sten is Russian. Asta Nielsen, known as the "Mother of German Film Stars," is Danish. Nils Asther and Greta Garbo are Swedish. Von Sternberg was born and raised in the United States. Lilian Harvey was born in England. Finally, Hitler himself was born in Austria. He does not speak purely German. His own nationality was given to him before he became Chancellor! What else is there to say!</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "The Private Life of Henry VIII"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>The Private Life of Henry VIII</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>"The Private Life of Henry VIII" tells the story of King Henry VIII of England, who changed his queen six times in his life, married his brother's widow, and had affairs with maids of honor. In short, he was an extremely lewd monarch. The story is very simple.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>When filming court films, the first thing to consider is the grandeur of the scene, which includes the set design and the performance. Because the architecture and furnishings of the court are undoubtedly extremely magnificent and opulent, and the processions and movements of the courtiers are quite operatic. This film, "The Private Life of Henry VIII," generally manages to achieve this.</p>
<p>Originally, making the form extremely solemn and grand can influence the audience's consciousness. Religious figures understand this principle best. Therefore, Buddhist temples and churches are always built extremely high and quiet. Even those who do not believe in religion will naturally "stand in awe" when they go there. The extreme beauty of the construction of the royal palace naturally shows the beauty of that era and that class to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>Due to the background, the director has to put more effort into the presentation of the background. But the most brilliant directors are able to tightly link the background with the characters in the story. Pudovkin's frequent use of long tracking shots is to solidify the relationship between the background and the characters in the story, to expand and strengthen the effect of "atmosphere." "The Private Life of Henry VIII" is quite rich in its depiction of the background. However, the atmosphere is the atmosphere, and the characters are the characters. There is little mutual assistance or even close connection between them.</p>
<p>Originally, it is impossible for individualistic writers to abandon the method of focusing on a single individual or a small number of protagonists and to depict a group or even a crowd. Therefore, "The Private Life of Henry VIII," with Henry VIII as the main body, gradually introduces the characters related to him. The producers naturally did not think about the connection between the characters and the background.</p>
<p>The male lead performs his duties very well, but the others are far behind. Fortunately, his scenes occupy the majority of the entire film!</p>
<p>Originally, writing this far is already enough. But the meaning of "court films" should be discussed, because past critics have done very little analysis of "court films."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, monarchical politics is a characteristic of feudal society. Although monarchy still exists today, they have completely lost the power of feudal society. The power of monarchs like those in England and Japan is less than that of a cabinet prime minister. Therefore, the things that monarchs in the feudal era did arbitrarily, the current monarchs will not do again. In particular, with the establishment of monogamy in individualistic modern society, even monarchs cannot openly and arbitrarily indulge in licentiousness. Thus, the romantic affairs of former monarchs have become material for people's conversations and are projected onto films as entertainment. "The Private Life of Henry VIII" is such a film.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, stories of licentiousness in past courts are everywhere. Even in China, the licentiousness and absurdity of the court in history were probably ten or a hundred times more serious than those of Henry VIII, but they could not be recorded in the historical records at the time. We have already seen quite a few in unofficial histories and miscellaneous notes. Therefore, we will not suspect that the producers of "The Private Life of Henry VIII" are exaggerating the story.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason why American producers chose the story of Henry VIII to make a film is partly, as I said above, for "entertainment," but mainly because modern society is a capital society that has fought and won against feudal society. Depicting the absurdity of the rulers of feudal society objectively proves the decline of feudal society. The rise of capital society is inevitable and reasonable. Moreover, the United States began with Washington's "democratic" politics. Therefore, their depiction of Henry VIII in England's past is naturally like "A Rustic's Exposure of Vulgar Sayings," detailing the rise and fall of neighbors, all for entertainment.</p>
<h3>Review of "Frontier Sea Sentiments"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>It is permissible to forgive small companies for the lack of skill in their works due to their weak capital, but at least the film itself should have some meaning.</p>
<p>The author of "Frontier Sea Sentiments" pompously stated in the subtitles that Chinese youth should colonize and cultivate the frontier to seek welfare for the country and the people… This good sign seems to be very appealing, because it is very fashionable. In fact, the so-called cultivating the frontier is just a self-deceiving slogan. For example, if the frontier that has already been cultivated has been invaded by the great powers, and if the invasion of the great powers does not disappear due to our resistance, then should we cultivate it again and wait for the great powers to slaughter it? The argument of advocating cultivating the Northwest after losing the Northeast is simply teaching people to seek death. As for the passive attitude, it is secondary.</p>
<p>No, the author of "Frontier Sea Sentiments" says that he wants to open a commercial port on the seashore of a savage land. Whether there is such a place in China, let alone whether there is such a place, it is really inexplicable that a few young people who are neither fish nor fowl can go to open it up. But, let's say again, does the author just take this sign as the theme? God knows, there is an extremely incomprehensible love affair on that seashore.</p>
<p>Secondly, the author writes very decently in the subtitles, opposing the barbarians putting lovers to death, which seems to be cursing feudal forces, but the result is supporting the cruel burning of people, and the heroine also repents and jumps into the sea because of unrequited love.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no plot without subtitles. The subtitles almost occupy half of the film. Several martial arts scenes are extremely hateful. The ape played by a person is simply vulgar and boring.</p>
<p>The relationship between men and women is extremely incomprehensible, and the number of "coincidences" is even needless to say.</p>
<p>It is said that the so-called director was originally a photographer. Due to his experience, he should be a little smoother. But he doesn't even understand the connection and editing. After a long shot, he takes a close-up. Because the long shot is not cut off, the same action is repeated twice. As for the indiscriminate use of Harvey, it is even more ridiculous. For example, a photographer who opens a commercial port fades in, with three people standing next to a camera, plus a subtitle saying that he wants to take a photo as a souvenir, and immediately fades out, and a scene ends. This is so childish and ridiculous, even worse than a biological Fade. Other things don't need to be said anymore.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People Look Up to the Queen</h3>
<p>One day, Sun Yu led the entire crew of "Sports Queen" from Lianhua No. 2 Factory to the Zhoushan Wharf in Nanshi to shoot exterior scenes. As soon as the camera was set down, many people surrounded it, and even the traffic was almost cut off. One shot was of the naughty Lin Ying climbing up the chimney of the ship alone. After Li Lili climbed up, people on the road far, far away stopped to watch. Because they usually only see stokers with sooty faces and dirty clothes brushing oil or scraping rust on it, now suddenly changing to a slender and beautiful woman, they will naturally feel surprised. Later, knowing that it was Lianhua Company filming a movie, and it was "Sports Queen" Li Lili, they flocked to the front, and the wharf and the ship were crowded with people, making it almost impossible for passengers to board the ship.</p>
<h3>Letter in Lieu</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Xiwen:</p>
<p>Your article "A Few Words of Nonsense Dedicated to the Film Special Issue" is not suitable for publication. Regarding the opinions you raised, I will briefly reply as follows. Film criticism, like literary criticism, inevitably involves critiquing the latest works. It is true that many readers may not necessarily see first-run foreign films, so it is indeed not very convenient for people who do not know the aristocratic film theaters. However, if those who pay attention to film criticism have an impression in their minds, it will be of some help when the second or third run is released. Or they can keep the reviews they saw in the newspaper that day to wait for future review, if they think it is valuable. In addition, what you said that critics and editors "have no patriotism" and do not criticize Chinese films is not in line with the facts. This magazine's efforts to promote Chinese films is the most obvious proof. As soon as the first new Chinese film is released, this magazine publishes critical texts in the most prominent position. This is my reply, I hope you understand! Editor</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Shi Ji:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding film theory books, the Chinese versions include "Film Art Theory" published by Shen Bao and "Film Directing Theory and Script Theory" published by Chen Bao, which can be used for reference. There are many English versions, which cannot be listed in detail.</p>
<p>(2) The word "Montage" is difficult to translate because it has the meaning of screen composition and screen editing. In addition, "Fade in" and "Fade out" are translated as "淡入" and "淡入", "Dissolve" is translated as "一化", "C.U" is translated as "特寫", "M.C" is translated as "中景"…etc. As for "Cut" being the end of a shot, I cannot write them all out one by one. The above-mentioned books are all included. After reading them, it is not difficult to understand. This is my reply. Editor</p>

<h3>Common Hatred ㈣</h3>
<p>— Hui Lan</p>
<p>The train is about to depart. Little Fen and Zhichao are saying goodbye on the platform, reluctantly. Zhen'an and many others have come to see him off. The green flag is waving. Little Fen is holding Zhichao's hand tightly. However, Zhichao finally gets on the train. Little Fen watches the train window moving. Unexpectedly, Zhang Manlin is sitting in the first-class car. When the train passes in front of Little Fen, Manlin leisurely pulls down the curtains. Little Fen begins to understand everything, and the pain and grief almost make her lose her way home.</p>
<p>In the carriage, Zhichao and Manlin are sitting together. At this time, Zhichao shows some remorse. He is unhappy, and Manlin is constantly teasing him.</p>
<p>The train is shaking violently when it starts. Manlin leans on Zhichao's chest. He certainly cannot refuse. Her hot eyes are staring at him, unblinking for a long time. Later, her gaze turns fiery. Zhichao lazily takes a cigarette from the cigarette case on the table, hands it to Manlin, and lights it for her. A victorious smile appears on Manlin's face.</p>
<p>"Jinan, Leader Li, Zhichao: I gave birth to a son this afternoon. Return to take a look and need money. Fen." Manlin, with a face full of anger, is holding this telegram in a daze. She looks at Zhichao's military uniform photo on the table and decisively turns over the telegram paper and immediately drafts a reply: "Yin Xiaofen, No. 34 Xu Street, what does the birth have to do with me? Do not bother me again in the future, Chao."</p>
<p>She packs her handbag, probably to send a telegram.</p>
<p>Sad and lonely Little Fen waits for Zhichao's reply for a long time and is extremely anxious. The door suddenly opens, and the servant happily brings the telegram. Little Fen smiles through her tears and reads the telegram. Little Fen's face turns pale, her hands tremble, and she suddenly cries uncontrollably. The servant is confused and hurries forward to ask what's wrong. Accidentally, she knocks over the flower pot on the table. The chrysanthemum that is about to wither, its petals fall one by one. After being abandoned by Zhichao, Little Fen has to move to a small, broken house.</p>
<p>The extra newspaper with "Pingjin Critical" is being shouted on the streets. Little Fen hears this sound, leaves the baby in the old cradle, pushes open the window, and looks outside.</p>
<p>A group of students is giving speeches to the public:</p>
<p>"The enemy is coming to Tianjin soon. Our hometown is being burned, our parents and wives are being slaughtered. Can we still not save it?…"</p>
<p>The masses are very excited after hearing this. Little Fen is shocked when she hears her hometown and her father. She remembers the words of her kind father who advised her not to trust Zhichao too much. She is sad and sheds tears. After a while, she decisively gets up, packs her luggage, and prepares to return home.</p>
<p>Manlin and Zhichao are standing opposite each other. Their emotions seem very tense. Zhichao seems to have made up his mind. Manlin glares at him, but after a while, she throws herself into Zhichao's arms like a kitten, stroking his face.</p>
<p>"Darling, you can't go! Fighting is not a fun thing. What will I do if you go?"</p>
<p>Zhichao's face, despite being stroked by her, does not change. Manlin uses all her charm, kisses, and kisses him constantly. However, he finally triumphs over emotion with reason, pushes Manlin in his arms away with both hands, solemnly and sadly:</p>
<p>"Manlin! You can make me a husband who betrays his wife, but you cannot make me a traitor who betrays the public!" (To be continued)</p>
