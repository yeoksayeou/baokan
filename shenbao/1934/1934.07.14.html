<p>本年入夏以來。氣候奇熱。沿長江一帶。雨水稀少。農苗枯萎。河水乾涸。最近報告旱荒的。已有蘇浙鄂皖和冀陜等六省數十縣。被災各處。紛紛成立旱災救濟會。甚至禁屠求雨等迷信舉動。亦到處皆是。不過大家注意的焦點。還在於防旱。而照旣往的經騐看來。今年的蝗災蟲禍。恐亦將打破歷年的紀錄而給農民們以絕大的威脅。我們千萬不要顧此失彼才好。</p>
<p>何以今年的蝗災。特别可怕。其中最大的理由是因爲氣候亢旱和蝗災的關係。最爲密切。古代志書中往往有「久旱大蝗」「大旱蝗飢」等旱蝗並書的記載。便是明證。我們知道蝗蟲是怕潮濕。足使蝗子腐爛。而不能孵化。反之如果土壤乾燥水分稀少那末蝗　孕育的機會便多了。本來一年中的五·六·七·八·四個月。是蝗災最重要的時期。而據去年蝗災的統計看來。六七月之交。又是發生次數最多的時候。目下正當七月中旬。氣候的亢旱炎熱。又是向來少有。所以不免已有秋蝻發生。秋蝻發生後。經過二十天左右。就能全身滋長而變爲「秋蝗」如果我們不卽設法預防。蝗災的嚴重必將遠過於往年。没有疑問。</p>
<p>去年的蝗災發生區域。共有冀·蘇·豫·皖·魯·浙·湘·遼·陜·晋·等十省。二百三十一縣。災情雖不及民國十八年時的嚴重。但被害面積亦達一千八百萬畝左右。農產等損失亦有二千萬元之鉅。今年六月初。實業部爲「懲前毖後」起見。曾有七省治蝗會議的召集。而具體的成績。爲了時間和經費的關係。還不能表演出來可是今年蝗災的朕兆則已很明顯的發見了。據最近報告。江蘇一省。蝗災的蔓延。已有　陽　水宜興等二餘縣如果不及早撲滅縱使没有旱魃爲災。亦將使秋收絕望。所以我們在防旱聲中。無論如何。還不可忘了防蝗。</p>
<p>說到治蝗的方法。據大家所知道的莫妙於開懇荒地。因爲蝗子生長在地下。普通藴藏於一二寸土壤以内。開墾過了的土地。必定有耕耙挖掘等項的翻土工作。一舉手間。不是把蝗子殺死。就把牠們翻到土面。上或者被鳥類和其他動物呑食。或者被暴日曬死。而孵化不出蝗蝻來。墾荒救國。本是大家所樂道的時髦名詞。何况還有治蝗的功用。豈不是一舉兩得嗎。可是這種工作。貴能「未雨綢繆」「急了抱佛脚。」可不嫌遲了何况就說不遲亦少有人去幹。所以退就共次。只可採用治標方法。如掘溝捕打之類。都是我國向來常用而有相當效果的。不過今年適當大旱聲中。一般農民苦於雨水不足。早已焦頭爛額。很難再有餘力去兼顧蝗。災那末。官廳人員和社會團體的從旁襄助。都是義不容辭的。</p>
<p>或者有人說。今年農苗枯萎。就有蝗虫亦吃不了枯苗吃了枯苗去對於破了產的農民亦不見得再加一重損失。這種意見是差的。因爲雨水不足。還可用機器灌漑方法。去加挽救。農苗枯萎。還可改種蕎麥綠豆等耐旱性的農作物。或提倡栽種二季稻。選定晚稻品種。而圖補助。換句話說如果我們能竭力設法。還能挽回刦運。而和天時爭民命。不見得就此絕望。所以正四天旱。我們更有預防蝗災的必要。不然若從旱魃魔手中奪下來的民命依然爲小小的蝗虫平白呑食了去。一切辛苦防旱的工作。還不是白費了。</p>
<p>本來在政治上軌道的國家。中央政府和各地方官廳對於治蝗事業。都是很講究的。一地方蝗虫的發育情形和遷移方向都可由歷年氣候變化和蝗種生態學的記錄中而預測出來有了預測的把握然後才能實施防止工作消滅飛蝗的繁殖機會。我們過去的治蝗成績。固然不能和人家相比較。但如去年河北省政府治蝗的認眞。亦就是很難得的實業部召集的七省治蝗會議早閉幕了。我們正眼巴巴的等着閉幕後關於治蝗事業的「新猷」現在正是治蝗的緊急關頭了。切盼政府諸公不要給我們失望才好。</p>

<p>海軍軍縮會議的豫備會、已在倫敦開始、這個會自然有牠的特殊性、明年正式會能否成功、當從此次預備會覘之所以這個會倒是今後太平洋上和平的重要關鍵、參加這個會的主要國家丨美·英·日·三國、都各具着不同的意見、大家的目的因之相異、如美國要保持兩大洋的交通、堅持大艦巨砲主義、主張延長倫敦海約、英國要確保她全世界海上殖民地安全、她的海軍務必要勝過其他各國、所以要擴張軍實、日本獨霸遠東的大勢已成、要和英美爭雄、所以力主軍備平等、這些意見、非比尋常的技術問題、這就是預備會議的暗礁、也是當前國際問題中的巨大癌腫、我們又知道美國在當世各國中、是比較不好以武力爭長的國家、對於太平洋爭霸、也並没有立卽用武的準備、不過她對於海軍還有她的特殊見解、同時也有她的準備、</p>
<p>因爲現總統佛蘭克林羅斯福曾在世界戰爭之前至華盛頓會議以後、任海軍次長的職位、他對日本雖寄與若干的好意、但實際上在他職任内是竭其全力以準備海軍、特别是在太平洋方面的軍實整備、對菲利濱對關島的要塞建築、一則因爲那兩處地方工程施設上費用太大、而且需要較長的時間、二則馬尼剌距美國海軍根據地又很遠、）海程約八千哩（無論如何美國現有實力難於穩保馬尼刺安全、所以纔努力經營其前衛根據於珍珠港、（夏威夷所屬的一個海港　）用爲對遠東的一個支點、新近還有經營亞留仙島作飛行塲的擬議、這不消說是注視着遠東的局勢、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統是海軍界有深切關係的人、他雖不由正面反對日本、但也不肯隨便讓步、至於現任海軍部部長史璜生、那更是澈頭澈尾的大海軍主義者了、他自信是帶得有建設起美國世界無敵的大海軍的使命、所以他有了驚人的大海軍計劃他在美國人民之前、高呼美國海軍已經腐朽不堪、他勸告美國人民卽承認實行他的海軍計劃、他說「我們西邊的侵略的鄰國、虎視耽耽的窺伺菲利濱········</p>
<p>大共和國的將來是該在海上的、」美國人民對此已經具有相當的認識、覺得美國如果没有强大的海軍、國際地位是很危險的、所以他又主張「五·五·三比率是絕對公正妥當、應該讓牠永久繼續、」還有是在海上作戰有權威的將校、如蒲拉德上將對國際海軍關係發表他的意見、反對日本的海軍比率平等的說法、他以爲日本没有像英國那樣須有警備全世界海洋的海軍之必要、日本不像美國界於大西洋與太平洋南洋之間、一旦戰事發生、日本中立國的地位、其所負責任也不似英美之重大、卽有戰爭、各國也不能對日本實行軍事上或經濟上的封鎖、並且增大比率的要求、徵諸日本國庫收入、也是難於負担、這樣的論調足以加强美國當局對海軍軍縮的意見、更明顯的傾向於延長以往的海軍條約、維持舊日比率引起未來的糾紛、</p>

<p>丨答羅叔度，朱啟統，方冰如三君科學的實踐觀，完全和它相反。它是反僅僅「捉住這一刹那一的，它不盲目地屈服於個個」</p>
<p>事實之前，它不過於誇大眼前的現實，它深刻地洞察現實的全發展，時時刻刻没有忘記其究極的目的，它以現實的人間矛盾對抗的事實爲</p>
<p>理解實踐的最實際的内容。</p>
<p>以下我們用實例來解釋以上抽象的說明罷。</p>
<p>譬如在辛亥革命以前，許多不滿意滿清統治的人只是敢怒而不敢言。當時看了孫中山先生談革命，以爲是狂妄無化，是一種不可實現的幻想。我們看見的只是滿清統治表面的權威，看不見社會潛藏的革命的力量，他們有的完全屈伏在當時的事實之前，連想也不敢一想，有的與統治者妥恊起來，主張什麽開明專制，以自解嘲。這是他們對於實踐的認識。</p>
<p>孫中山先生則不然，他能洞察中國民族革命的全發展，他不貪圖目前的一點小利，與滿清政府合作，他没有忽視終極的目的。所以他的實踐觀是科學的。</p>
<p>再拏一個店員學徒的讀書做例子罷！現在大多數的店員學徒對於讀書是抱着什麽態度呢？據我們所知道的，一部分人是消遣，一部分人是想爬上去，另一部分抱有另一種想了解現實的决心，他們對於個人的實生活，第一種人只看見黑暗面，把黑暗太誇大了。第二種人只看到目前一點不可捉摸的小利，市俗化了。第三種人却能看到遠些，由是，前一種人讀的書自然不離幾本談情言鬼的爛調小說，第二種人祇埋頭在練習字，打算盤，抄尺牘。第三種人則不然，他們却要求讀社會科學或進步的文學書，他們要求了解社會。第一第二種人對於實踐觀，都只看到目前壓在他頭上的個個事實。他們一方面是苟安墮落，一方面是想靠增進自已的技能，戰勝不可避免的失業恐慌。總之都是想在維持現實下苟安一時。都没有看見整個社會實踐的變動，都忘了究極的目的。第三種人則不然，因爲他對於實踐的了解的不同，他知道，學第一種得過且過是會墮落下去，不是一個積極的人應走的道路，也不能像第二種人，閉着眼睛，想用個人來克服這在現狀下不可避免的巨力（如失業）。他的實踐觀，不是從個人利害着眼的。他知道在現狀下，像店員學徒之類的人的命運，就是整個中國社會的命運。個人的實踐與整個社會的實踐是融成一體的。因此，做一個學徒，固然應該學習技術，但最重要的還在如何的做人上。技術不能忘記究極的目的。否則，你只會成爲一個資本參謀部内忠順的工作者，立於一種社會進化相反的極上起着作用的人物。並且，你不會爬上，你向上爬的機會，一天少似一天了。你仍不免被人棄置到饑綫上去。</p>
<p>在這種釋以下，實踐觀是眞理的標凖。日本財閥軍閥的實用主義，並不成爲日本大衆的實踐觀。他不是眞理的尺度，眞理不會因這些自利主義而失去它的標凖，我想，舉一反三，你們對於科學的實踐觀，或者可以有了相當槪念了罷？</p>

<p>常人所誤解和疏忽的細微末節、都是球藝的基本原則　　握拍方法旣如前章所述、至於足部、腿部、身軀和目光的應用、初學者每每忽略過去、以爲是很容易的事、但是此種應用的法則、是球藝的基本原則、也就是將來球藝成功的穩固基礎、所以我們應當詳細研究、</p>
<p>綱球名手常有足部和身體的地位失當、所以他們有時也要失誤、並不是他們不知道這是擊球時最忌的事、明知故犯的綠故、完全是由于他們從前學習時染了不良的習慣　　足部的正當工作、就是在對方的來球、還没有達到以前、球員要利用空隙的時間、不慌不忙地把脚踏穩在適當的地位、有時在競爭激烈的時候、因爲對手故意將球拍至塲中的遠處、使你不得不奔跑去應付、此種被逼的奔跑、就是名手也不能免的、但是無論如何、奔跑的迎擊、總不能算是最好的方式、</p>
<p>球員在未拍擊來球以前、必定要有時間去把脚踏在實地、大半最適當的地位、是雙足和球的飛程成平綫、然後藉着身體的重量去、增加向擊球的同一方向擺動力、有些聰明的球員、完全不顧到足部地位、那是一種例外、决不是初學者所應當抄襲的、</p>
<p>雙足和球飛成平行綫、其利有三、一是、擊球時對于手臂的擺動、有絕大的自由、二是、雙足穩踏實地、體重能够藉着「順勢力」FOLLWTHTONGH增加擊球的力量、三是、球員能够進退自如、向前向後、絕不感覺困難、較之雙足和球綱成平行綫、要方便得多、</p>
<p>當休息着等候對方發球或還擊的時候、雙足此時所立的地位、就要和球綱或球的飛程成斜綫因爲有移動地位的需要、此種方式、是向前後左右移動、都不受拘束的、但是實行擊球的時候、最好還是使雙足和球的飛程成平行綫、</p>
<p>雙足一前一後地立着距離要適當不可太窄、使臂部擺動的動作、能得穩固的基礎、和順勢力不致失掉平衡、至於雙足分開的距離、究竟要多少遠、那就要看球員脚部的長短、和擊球時所用的順勢力的輕重、才能規定、通常的距離、是以二英呎爲度太寛了、在擊球以後、就會牽制足部的移動、太窄了、在擊球時、就會限制拍擊的力量、不僅雙足要分開立穩、並且無論何時、都要用足趾立着、切不可用足跟踏在地上、因爲迎擊來球、較你預料略高、或略低的時候、要足趾不落地、才能自由地應付、而且這種預料、不凖確的情形、雖說是綱球名手、也是時常不能免的、預備下一次還擊的時候、立在足趾比較足跟着地、移動起來要快得多、「立在足趾」是各種運動的秘訣、在綱球術上更是加倍的重要、</p>

<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>電池自一千八百年Volla氏發明以來，迄今一百餘年，其中變更與改良，已非一次，應用亦日見增加，其於無綫電應用亦廣，尤其是交流電尚未普及之我國，故銷售頗暢。</p>
<p>電池昔時可分二種，乾電池與蓄電池，前者壽命短促，且輸出電壓不匀，眞空管每易受損壞，後者壽命雖較長，但嫌充電之不便，故現已有新式空氣電池之發明。</p>
<p>空氣電池形似蓄電池，而其構造則與乾電池略同，惟炭精爲一能吸收空氣之特製炭條，其所吸收之養氣，於中和相近起極作用之輕氣後，卽成爲清水，故自始至終，電壓變更極微，約自二·二弗打降至一·九弗打，如是眞空管亦不易損，且壽命極長，較之普通乾電池，或蓄電池，相差可遠。蓋蓄電池亦祗能用至一百小時，而空氣電池竟能耐用至一二千小時以上，以上爲其優點。　　空氣電池電壓爲二伏脫，電流爲六百安培，最大負荷電流爲·七五安培，如最稍大，則電池瞬時可壞，宜注意之。</p>
<p>此電池乃根據省電式眞空管而設計，如等，今設有單管機一具，檢波爲號，其絲極電流爲·零六安培·則600+06=10000小時，如以每日開聽五小時，則可用至二千日約五年有奇，此種電池，封得極固，决不使受潮氣侵襲而耗電法，故無論　置多時，使用與新者完全相同。又設有上述各眞空管無論幾管，可依下面公式算之。</p>
<p>600A=小時/（每日開　各管絲極總電流多少小時）</p>

<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>㈢分綫鑰制此爲較佳之方法。利用分綫鑰以變換配諧綫圈之自感量，同時可用容量較小之可變電容器，以求配諧電臺，可較爲平均分配於刻度盤上。至於與天綫之配合，有二種方法；一爲磁感交連，如第一圖。天地綫回路亦用一分綫鑰，初級與次級之間，亦用調節式量者。此種設計，時合用於短天綫，或收較長波長之電臺。二爲電容直接交連，如第二圖。天綫下串接之電容器，容量須五十兆兆分法拉特以下者。此種綫路頗合用於長天綫，或收較短波長之電臺乙構造討論　　選擇性之優越，固關乎綫路之得失。而構造之適當與否，關係更大。吾人每構造一機，在刻度盤五十度以下（卽波長短者之電臺），分隔不清之弊，恒較五十度以上者爲甚。實非綫路之不佳，而爲構造上之缺憾也。</p>
<p>配諧電路之構成，爲可變電容器與綫圈，通常業餘家，綫圈多自行設計繞製，而可變電容器多售自廠家。同時配諧電路又受全綫路中之傍路電容器，桅制圈，及接綫情形等之影響。簡言之，波長短時之配諧，往往不敏銳，皆爲上述種種所造成之潛佈電容量作崇之結果㈠變量電容器國產者多屬直綫電容理或直綫長者。故短波長之配諧，往往不銳。若P等廠製造之直綫週率與折裏式者，則電臺之分佈可稍均匀。然而以鄙人試騐結果，知選擇性與此點之關係尚淺，其與可變電容器之最不電容量，關係頗大。一般人士，以爲用五○○兆兆分法拉特之電容器時選擇性不佳，易以較小容量之電容器如三五○兆兆分法拉特者，卽可較佳，此種見解，實爲錯誤，蓋二電容器之最小電容量固相若也。國產電容器容量在三○兆兆分法拉特以上者，最小電容量在二○至二五兆兆分法拉特左右，舶來品之設計良好者多在二○至十二兆兆分法拉特之間。相差尚屬有限。竊以爲廣播段所用之可變電容器，儘可用國產出品，其較大之達經濟目的。（待續）</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>因爲五極管能以極小量的輸入，獲得極大量的輸出，所以新式收音機末級低週率放大，大槪没有不採用牠的。　　普通眞空管的簾栅極電壓，均較屏極電壓爲低。）如-24管屏壓爲25OV時，簾栅壓祇有90V57管屏壓爲250V時，簾栅壓祇有100V）但是低週率輸出五極管（如3347及2A5等）簾栅極電壓，却與牠的屏壓相等，使用此類眞空管時，如果忘將喇叭或輸出變壓器接上，簾栅極便立卽發紅，萬一時間稍長，眞空管卽有焚燬之虞，所以：</p>
<p>使用輸出五極管時，如果屏路没有接通，切弗隨便開放。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>電臺林立，發射週率相差愈小，收音愈感困難，不用外差式綫路的收音機，竟無法避免羣波騷擾，然若加一具超選擇性的濾波器於收音機的射電週率輸入之前，竟有非常的效力。</p>
<p>圖示超選擇性的濾波器綫路，係接於收音機射電週率放大級棚回路上，AB兩綫圈，用圈，用二十四號雙紗包綫依同方向各繞三十五圈於直徑二吋半的個膠木圓筒上，AB兩圈間相距爲二英分，電容器C的容量爲人百券法拉，或三十五片式的；老式四十五片的更佳。</p>
<p>此濾波器的有效選擇週率自七百至一千五百十週波，調整時先移動收音機電容器刻度盤至欲所收的某電臺週波數上，乃徐徐調整濾波電容器C，待輸入汛號至一最强度點乃止。</p>

<p>— 幽蘭</p>
<p>夏天收音時之天電騷擾，實爲最可惱之事，况收音機愈精美，其擾雜聲愈多·天電之原因不一·大槪於接收　附近天空大氣電位之變化·或靜電之放電如雷電等·以致間接或直接感應及天綫發生强迫振盪以生極不規則之雜聲·其聲或如石擊，或如蟲鳴甚無一定·避除天電騷擾方法殊多而有效者少·今將其補救法述於左，以供諸位同志參考，惟祇能避免一二，未能完全避免，蓋此亦無綫電中一難以解决之問題也·</p>
<p>㈠夏天收音以收本埠之强力電臺爲上蓋取其力大而發聲響亮，得以掩没天電騷擾。</p>
<p>㈡專收本埠電臺，因其天電騷擾較收遠地爲少·又收北方之電臺亦較收南方之電臺爲少·又收北方之電臺亦較收南方㈢所收之節目以京戲及外國樂隊爲佳，因其聲粗大，足使天電騷擾在無形中消滅。</p>
<p>㈣將擴音器置於鄰室或聽時人離收音機稍遠亦能避免·</p>
<p>㈤夏天收音以天綫短者爲佳，因長天綫易收天電，最好用室内天綫，因其不特能避免天電騷擾，且可避免雷擊。㈥以礦石作檢波亦能避免天電騷擾，且發音清晰·</p>
<p>㈦應用地下天綫亦能避免天電騷擾，地下天綫之裝置法如下，</p>
<p>用一大號香烟紙匣，匣中裝滿炭屑，再用二只已壞的甲電池埋在此炭屑中，這二只電池是互相接的，用一條十四號包皮綫接出來當作天綫的引入綫，在那只紙匣的外面用裸銅綫）十四號（繞滿，將牠的一頭引出來當作地綫用，於是把這紙匣埋在地下卽可，愈深愈好，惟至少須二三尺深。</p>
<h3 id="c245">袖珍式二管收音機 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>經濟輕便構造簡單效力優越此機是上回在鑑村先生的大作「再談袖珍式收音機」一篇在本刋發表後，引起了老友茜君的興致而要我代他設計的。</p>
<p>經試騐結果，效力極佳，音質之清晣，音量之宏亮，選擇性之靈敏，收音之遙遠，足以與普通四管機相昆美，線見圓一。</p>
<p>因爲在設計時，偏重在「袖珍」方面，所以對於體積重量上，都不得不力求其巧小輕便；結果，除了極力减少零件外，更將兩級低放採用耗阻交連，這樣不特可以省去兩只低周率變壓器·使全機的重量體稍减輕縮小，並且使音質更是清晣悅耳。</p>
<p>眞空管是採用新式的號和33號各一枚；33號的特性和效力早已爲各研究同志們所知，至於19號因爲剛問世不久，或并道有一部分的同處　　　　　　，特加略說明介紹於后</p>
<p>此式爲美國新式乙類放大管，適用於眞流機内工作，共輸出力在低周率放大時’可得二·一互特·其特性如下。　　絲壓二·弗打絲流○·二六安培屏壓一·三五弗打屏流五扮安培）每屏（</p>
<p>雖然在本機中工作的祇有兩枚眞空，但因爲19號内部由兩個三極部分所組成，加33號，實際上有三個眞空管的作用，再加應用來復式的線路，所以有四管機的效力。其工作情形大槪如此：</p>
<p>無線電波，經過配諧電路到19號　空管，第一個三極部分作高放，第二個三極部分作檢波，而後回輸至第一三極部分作第一低放，再輸入33號眞空管作末級强放，再由揚聲器放聲；故所得之音，極清晰響亮，選擇性又佳。</p>
<p>此機用電由電池供給，A電用國產二弗打二十五安培蓄電池，F電用小型四十五弗打，B電三方串接。</p>
<p>普通爲着要防止低放管的屏流過大後，容易損傷揚聲器或聽筒，所以都採用分濾器；本機因33號的屏流有十四半份安培之巨，故最好也採用之，其裝置法見圖二，</p>
<p>圖中AFC爲低周率阻流圈，約30H25MA已够用，C爲斷路電容器容量自025MFD至2MFD均可。</p>
<p>線圈LLLLLLC4可用一時直徑紙管繞之，LLLLLC4可用一時直徑紙，LL各一百二十五圈，均用32號漆色綫繞，各線圈間的距離約一二分卽可L1L2各一百二十五圈，均用32號漆色綫繞，各線圈間的距離約一二分卽可，L3L4同繞在一管上，L3十五圈，L4百二十五圈，用32號漆色線繞，L3與L4距離約四五分光景。</p>
<p>此機可裝置在一7*45*5將小木箱内，至於件的排列方法，也許聰明的讀者比我列精明一點所以不再多話。　　此機如用聽筒收音，可完全不用天L線，而發音極響，好在此機有音量控制器，决不會損傷耳鼓，如用揚聲器收音，不用天地線亦可，只須在19號第一三極部分的栅極拖一八九尺長的花線卽可（如圖一虚線）</p>

<p>普通業餘者總想用一些小智慧來增加收音機的音量，其實這個很便當，祗要接一隻栅漏在檢波栅極與第一級低週波放大管之屏極間，如圖所示，當然栅極的接綫是愈短愈好，栅漏的數値起碼在五百萬歐姆以上，若歐姆數小，則倒要產一連績不斷的呌聲，道是因低週波振盪而起的，所增的音量，實足驚人，這樣的改裝有時檢波用的栅漏竟也可省去不用，這種方法在直流機内很値得一試因爲旣可增加音量又可節省乙電，</p>
<p>不抽頭的方棚也可以用成推挽式我們時常遇到要做推挽式放大時而没有抽頭的方棚，）因推挽式必須用抽頭的方棚）現在這裏有一個法子可以介紹給諸位没有抽頭的方棚也能用在推挽式中，如圓所示方棚的級是接在眞空管的栅極上現在用二隻電阻串聯在方棚的次級中，并且在二電阻之間，通一根地綫電阻之歐姆數可自十五萬至五十萬惟二電阻之數値須相等，</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>吉𠾐坡吉𠾐坡（KualaLumpur），�</p>
<p>是馬來聯邦的都城，馬來半鳥交通的中心。有規模雄偉的車站，有繁複的鐵送綫。牠站在馬來半島的中心。英國的殖民長官長駐此地，控制着南南北</p>
<p>北的許多馬來酋長們，也控制着許多東方的弱小民族。</p>
<p>吉𠾐坡，一個人爲的吸血鬼，一個次本主義的都市形態。牠吮吸着錫鑛和樹膠的血液而繁榮，牠建立於錫鑛工人和樹膠工人的血汗之上。牠有着清潔而繁華的街道，牠曾經在馬來半島的「黃金時代」發出了金錢的響朗之聲。</p>
<p>然而吉𠾐坡是中國人一手造成的。客人葉來曾帶其族人血戰於此。當英人挾其大砲威臨馬來半島的時候，清廷却讓葉來拱手把這辛闢成的熟地奉送，）詳梁啟超氏的葉來傳。（使英帝國能在這兒建立牠在馬來的統治機關，而中國人却在「不景氣」底下受着鞭了！旅行到此，不勝慨嘆！</p>
<p>新嘉坡</p>
<p>新嘉坡，檳榔嶼和馬六甲，算是英政府直接統治的殖民地，合稱海峽殖民地）StraitSet（tlement）；中國人却把牠呌做叻，嶼，　。（叻是噴叻的簡稱。國内人呼新嘉坡也。）</p>
<p>新嘉坡，一個污濁與罪惡的都市；却是被稱做「赤道的巴黎」的。現在是，砲臺上的砲口直指海中；未來的太平洋和印度洋的海水將被攪成癲狂的浪花，而升旗山上的旗幟或許會變色。</p>
<p>新嘉坡，日裏響着金錢的鏗鏘之聲；而夜裏，却榨出肉的氣息和生命的嘆息。</p>
<p>新嘉坡，日裏灰塵蔽天，太陽的赤熱蒸在柏油道上。新嘉坡從外表上看來，是十足地象徵出帝國主義在殖民地的威風的。</p>
<p>新嘉坡，是世界人種博覽會之一。這個博覽會，却無疑地是由英人主持着的。</p>
<p>你如果要明白新嘉坡的本質，你最好去看看新嘉坡的總督府和帝國兵營。你最好看看幾隻戰艦泊在海中，艦上禁飄着米字國旗；或才看看一隊步兵走在新嘉坡道上，或者一隊帝國義勇軍出發操演；你可以看看那些雄壯的軍容，和那些明亮的軍器。</p>
<p>至如你要想從新嘉坡看出南國的面貌和精神，那一定會使你失望的。你應該深入腹地，爬進荒林野徑中，然後你才能了解這個神秘的赤道的國土。因爲新嘉坡是被帝國坡已經失了牠本來的和平而恬靜的面目。</p>

<p>— 叔靈</p>
<p>「中國現代文化之動向」，在今日，成爲時髦的題目了。</p>
<p>倘使自鴉片戰爭時代起算，的確，「動』是動得非常利害，至於『向』，則人各異其詞，而且無往不言之成理。</p>
<p>老百姓生活不下去了的動，這裏且不多說，只看負有文化使命的知識分子怎樣？外國的槍砲巨艦攻入之後，有些人在故紙堆中探出頭來，不免有些胆戰，於是乎『中學爲體，西學爲用』起來。　　一直到新文化運動起來之後，一干人更認定德先生和賽先生爲現代文化的兩輪。同時，通都大邑，大量生出買辦之外，也矗起衝天的烟囱，環繞這四周的，還有青年男女在拚命地跳舞着，另一方面怎樣呢？三家村裏的學究却在敎學生寫這類文章（見某省敎育刋物）：</p>
<p>「論者有言日。惟天生民有欲。無君乃亂。君也者。萬民之所瞻仰。社稷之所寄托。雖在平安無事之時。『由』不可無之。而况於敵國鷹瞵强鄰虎視之日哉。······」丨丨高宗復辟論。</p>
<p>「·····菩薩者何？菩者普也，蕯者」</p>
<p>濟也，尊稱神祇故有菩薩之號。敬者何？恭敬之心也。釋道本外國之種，尚和恭敬；菩薩我國之人，高居華夏，素稱禮義之邦，豈可不知敬菩薩之道哉？」丨說敬菩薩。乂乂乂乂『中國現代文化』是：眞龍天子，電影明星，跳舞，跑狗，賽馬，國粹馬將，劍俠，同善社，峨嵋山，少林寺，哥老會，鴉片，雪茄，白麵，『花瓶』，躦狗洞，仙人跳，十姊妹，乂乂主義，乂乂主義，空中英雄，自殺····」</p>
<p>這「動」的跡象之被表現在年青人的行動中者，可設譬以明之丨賈寳玉的父親是洋行買辦，因此賈寳玉得留學美國，等到學成歸國之後，便在上海出風頭，剛巧林黛玉在那兒讀書，於是一見傾心，一同去看電影，打牌，跳舞，跑狗，賽馬·····於是開房間，完成一手交錢，一手交貨的戀愛，但照例這就有一個失戀，就比方是林黛玉罷丨林黛玉便哭起來，做了許多詩，這便遇到職業文學家，於是發現比自殺更高貴的一條路丨革命，倘她不願這樣走，又不願自殺，那末她將遇到『劍俠』，將她拿來跳仙人跳，玩躦狗洞，這下塲頭可說不來，也許是『野鷄』。</p>
<p>中國現代文化是最奇怪的文化：有兩千年前的，有兩百年前的，乃至最時髦的。這些『文化』，有的混合，有的根本就對立，有的矛盾地互相容洽，於是到處都顯見文　化失調（ＣunluralMaladjust）ment）。</p>

<p>— 星野</p>
<p>黃梅雨時節，到處是粘濕。海雲低低的罩着遠近山邱。飛雲江隔岸的方形屋子，有點像鴿子籠。碼頭潮水才退，石子路中帶着黃色江泥。一步一滑的走到了渡口，雨中特别的不方便。渡頭的人們有點粗暴，他們還是數百年前的樣子。駡，是談話中的不可缺少成份。吵，已經成爲他們的天性。雖然小輪船已代替了搖槳的舟人，然而過渡的客人依舊站在極其舊式的渡船上，讓小輪船在前面拖着。船舷上還站着人，船底積着黃泥和黑水。皮鞋在南岸的小路上得得的走着，我覺得自已有點俗氣。用在異國大都市的行人道上的快步走方式在這裏應用。别人看去有點太不自然。我想要他們也同我一樣的快着走，挺着身走，然而我看到底只是一個人。我又不願意駝背起來學他們像鵝一樣的慢慢地走。從渡口到長湖的小湖輪，只有幾步路，然而他們走起來還是很長。我希望有一個電動的大鐵鏟，把我們一塊拖起，像起貨機一樣的把我們送去，抛入小湖輪裏面去。你想，那是多麽痛快。</p>
<p>長湖依舊是那樣美麗，我看見幽美的湖山，頓時覺得自已的濁俗。那雁蕩山的影子，在南邊隱隱的露出來。湖長三十里，而湖端便是故鄉了。廬荻長滿了汶港的口岸。兩岸的早稻，在初晴的風日中鬥着湖岸，故鄉，我離你了已經那麽長久。石橋灣地跨着湖岸，橋的兩端都種着榕樹。榕樹伏在地上，青翠像一個事蓋，夏日的榕樹陰，有特别綠而且嫩的清輝。白鳥在綠陰間栖息，誰能來描摹這幅晝圖？</p>
<p>湖面很闊，近岸處泛着浮萍，萍的葉兒貼在水面，是那樣柔順而温馴。圓的像錢幣，長的作鷄形，葉上有時長出小白花來，雖小而秀雅得很。更有些野荷花，是綠色的肥葉構成，而開紫紅色花兒的，打槳的人最討厭這個東西，因爲如果野荷花長滿湖面，打槳的便挿不下槳兒，而假使舟覆人沉，在野荷兒下面是斷無被救之望的。</p>
<p>在小汽輪中看見的，是許多掛着證章的公務人員。許多是不買票的。當賣票的向他們說話，他們故作不見不聞，賣票的問第二句，他便破口大駡了。端陽節近了，船上有許多商店的店員，是從較大的城市到各小鎭收賬的，他們穿得都很乾凈，青的褲和白的短衣，有的還是用絲造成的。唱曲的人來了，拖着那像猪殺倒時所發一樣的聲音，說那不倫不類的官話，使人又笑又氣。當他的大口張開時，褐黑色的牙齒，有幾個已落掉。我想天下最醜惡的東西，莫過於這副尊口了。然而許多船客諦耳恭聽，有時還和音而唱，表示他們也知道哼什麽「青的山綠的水」的。</p>
<p>田野泛着綠色的波浪，那便是將熟的早稻。農田上一切是整齊有秩序。稻田的風景，可以做一個天然的公園。辛苦的農夫們，依舊足着起在那裏雙手忙着。中古式的耕耘，固然有他特有的興趣，然而爲什麽不敎這些知道勞苦的壯丁們，到大礦工大鐵廠裏面去替國家產生更大財富，而讓一兩把機器來替代數千人的勞力呢？當然我在異國未嘗看過這樣有秩序有美術意味的的田莊，機器使農田醜惡化的。然而我們不願意對這點有所迷戀。</p>
<p>小汽船拖着我向萬山中拖的一處前進，山合得愈窄，我又快樂又感傷的心兒更覺有莫名其妙味。「近鄉情更怯，不敢問來人」。或者也是這莫明其妙的心理狀態中一種吧！</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>我永不忘記太平年代的夏晚，夏晚鄉村裏那戀人的塲園。蝙蝠翅膀閃出了黃昏，蛛綱上斜掛着一眼熱悶，推開飯碗，擦一把臭汗，大人孩子提一領簑衣跑去了塲園，塲園上没有不快的牆垣，風從禾稼聲中吹來，全無遮攔，像四面的清流洩下了山巖，各人揀好一塊地方，坐臥那全憑自已的心願，先來後到的一陣亂打招呼，（從脚步上認，全用不到看臉）時間候到了最後的一人，一輪滿月正掛在東天。樹影在這羣人身上亂掃，掃凈了一切，只一縷看不見的香烟氲氤在人和人中間。大人的臉對着天空，心裏念着一些星名，他們用星决定未來，銀河絃上繫着命運，一顆彗星偶然掃過，給他們添了一份担心；小孩子强支住恐怕，閉着眼，（黑影中没法看那張臉！）</p>
<p>用拔不出來的耳朶聽紅毛的鬼怪，從大人口裏慢慢的跳出來，直等媽媽隔牆遙呼，）呼聲裏帶親愛的駡辭（</p>
<p>纔哀求大人帶他們家去，眼縫裏閃進了遠處的鬼火，拚命的掣緊大人的衣角夜裏來一塲心跳的夢，一個紅毛鬼打一個燈筒。夜在塲園上飛，人却不知覺，不知覺的淡盡了天上的星月，陽光攢開了隔夜的眼睛，爬起來，只覺得一身露重。幾時再有這樣太平的夏晚？我永忘不了這戀人的塲園！）七月五日村夜不敢睡對悶熱的燈光成此）</p>

<p>「我的天呀！我的天呀！」他低喃道。差不多踉蹌一樣地，他再回坐到書桌前，倒伏在報章雜誌的中間：報章雜誌的中央閃着一盞暗暗的燈火。　　在他前面放着些已經寫好的稿子，尚是空白的紙張。他眼睛對着它們望着。下了一股强烈的决心，他拿起筆來。但他看見筆尖抖動在他好像是由於對縫衣機的響而來。已經寫好的頁數上的字合着縫衣機的節拍跳起舞來，他的眼睛隨了字底眩目的跳動而暈花。筆尖的抖動透到了他的乎上來，又從乎透到臂，從臂透到頭上去。摘搭的聲音在空中，在跳躍着的字裏，在他的神經裏，腦子裏。他又有什麽可寫呢？丨丨他不知道丨丨他也記不起。在他裏面，在他外面，到處是聲音，聲音没有旁的什麽。天哪！天哪！在潔白的紙張上，那枝瘓癱的筆丨不時没在墨水裏丨儘畫着神秘的圈子兒丨或者就聽讓墨涙淌瀉了來。時當一聲高響的門鈴聲强力地從頭到脚的震動他，他才意識到太陽最初的光綫已經透過窗子，昏暗了燈火。</p>

<p>有個人走了進來，隨身帶進一些室外的冷空氣；他的鼻子，套在兩者之間丨一項蒙耳污欄的高頂帽之邊及一件幾乎藏過了他　瘦之身的鬆外套底大披肩，簡直看不見。</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>今年入梅以後，天氣亢旱，尤其是熱度像已到伏裏的景光；這幾天，火傘高張，炎歊逼人，華氏表高至一百零四度四，爲向來所未有的紀綠；吾輩靜處一室之中，手中揮扇不停，猶覺汗流如瀋好不悶損人啊！</p>
<p>我因此想到天旣爲人之惡其寒而輟其冬，亦何不爲人之惡其熱而減其夏，把脚底下渾圓的地球，從南北雨個軸兒掉轉過來，那末：冷熱的氣候，自然會得融和，這豈不是世界上一件天從人願的事麽？然而無論那個科學家，也没有這種旋乾轉坤的本領；所以自古有『焦金流石』的當兒，你儻到郊外去一　，哦！那四野裏的農田，坼裂像龜文一般，就是棉和豆，都乾得葉黃枝枯，恐再不能有復活的生機；若種的是禾稻，秧田裏還没有工作完成，農夫正牽着老牛，在車棚中連夜的趕水，或者一男一女，踏上車架，四隻脚不斷的行動，這種生活，是何等的苦啊！然而照這樣下去，天儘加上熱度，太陽如火一般的逼，恐怕田旁邊的不河，也終有乾涸的一天，你如不信，請聽這桔　的聲響，自然不會送到耳鼓裏來了，到這時候，就呌是『旱荒』，還不獨『苦熱』兩字够人們受用呢！</p>
<p>記得以前倘遇了天旱，地方官也要替民想法，雖則到一所廟裏求禱，是純屬迷信的把戲，但總算還想着『雨水』，是田中不可少的；而鄉人抽竹翦紙爲旗，舁土偶以行卜，照現在講：畢竟是笑話，不過近來機器萬能，尚覺不能造雨水，普遍到大地，這又怎樣說呢！</p>

<p>在辦公室裏，電風扇咕咕的轉動，渾身的汗珠還是從毛孔裏向外的攢冒，一顆顆珠粒似的，潔凈的面巾，經了幾次的揩拭就起了汗臭的異味，寒暑表的線條慢慢兒從上升起，電風扇已漸漸失去凉意，吹來的風，也帶些熱氣了！</p>
<p>平坦的柏油馬路，經了烈日的薰炙，汽車經過的地方，就深深的留下一個印痕，黃包車夫，雖則他們平素的生活是枯澀的，但在這炎的淫威下，也把他們靠以生存的工具丨車輛丨在可能範圍的路旁停歇着：不再實行他們的兜攬行動，爭先恐後，敞開了精破的布衣，團聚着談笑。</p>
<p>街頭巷尾，衣衫襤褸，裸足的小孩子，背上背了一隻筐，不停的跑着喚着，陰冷呀，賣冰呀！賣冰呀！渾身冒出汗珠，他們的呼喚，在烈日下的呼喚，是否出自心願，還是爲着生命而呼喚，這聲調，雖則比水上戰爭的那樣動人魂魄但他們的聲調，是悽鬰的哀惋的。</p>

<p>誰都知道，處於春秋之間的是夏季，偉大的夏季；這夏是藴藏着絕大的原動力，它有兇悍的日光，温柔的南風，而我們主要的食物丨稻也靠着這日光這南風長大了。夏也是百草的過渡時期，草兒在這個時候放得最青，也在這個時候漸於趨於苔黃了。</p>
<p>在酷熱的太陽下，不知道把苦力榨出了多少的臭汗，也不知道揩濕了多少的烏黑的毛由；同時候，在電風扇下的安閒狀態之中，不知道多少的冰，汽水塞進了安閒的人們的闊大的嘴巴。</p>
<p>街頭上露骨的肉誘惑，不知道麻醉了多少的血氣未定的青年，也不知道增進多少　了的幻想，春夢。</p>
<p>環境的支配，應時的幾百家的飲冰室的產生；冰琪琳，汽水，把沸熱的愛國</p>

<p>— 波光</p>
<p>梅子黃時，原是個多雨的季節。但是今年入霉以後，歷久不雨。並且天氣酷熱，比伏暑更厲害，太陽好似一盆的燒紅炭火，炙人膚痛，又把禾田晒得龜裂，嫩綠的秧針，已顯露了焦枯的色采，農人没有一天不在渴望雲霓！記得張宗昌督魯的時候，因爲天久不雨，它傳令下屬，在高山巔，排了幾尊大砲，鳴砲十二響，求上蒼賜雨！又西北要人馮玉祥，它曾在高山上集了數百担茅柴，把它燃着，一時火光冲天。待火熄之後，果然大雨滂沱，這是空氣變化的綠故，很合科學的原理。</p>
<p>四安是久不上雨了，幾個鄉長，就傳知鄉人，擇定生着茅草深長的荒山數個，把四週的茅草割去，成了一條界綫。前日引火燃燒，歷三晝夜火勢未熄，火熖熊熊，映得半天都成了紅色。尤其在晚上可稱奇景，火光蛫蜒數十里，宛似游龍，在順興高橋上站看的人，眞是不少。一共燃燒了三天四夜，等到火熄之日，天空中就陰霾四合，下着黃豆般大的雨點，可惜没有多少時候就雨止的。此番試騐已有了成効，聽說下次要作大規模的舉行了。科學的進步眞是神速！連鄉鎭上也知道科學萬能了。</p>

<p>東海的陽光，照射在沙灘上，金黃閃爍。和浩渺的碧綠江水；凑成美麗色調。熏風吹動浪花，打着小石子發出宏偉的節奏。夏已降臨在「高橋之濱了！</p>
<p>沉靜似沙漠的海濱浴塲，這幾天大爲熱忙，「南京路」外灘市輪渡，載着到海濱去的人們，十二时手提箱中，安放了浴旅行凳，攝影機·····。男女們的面龐上都露出絲絲笑意，一壁撫摸着肌膚，很慶幸地將受海水的洗禮。</p>
<p>公共汽車的轉載，一小時的行程，已到了目的地·丨海濱·循着塘堤向浴塲那裏進發，荒烟蔓車閒，顯露「龍王廟」紅牆一角。僵臥着斷斷肢殘體數尊砲位，「一二八」慘影，驟湧在憑弔者的心頭。白浪轟轟地響，宛似敵艦在放大砲。遙望對岸吳淞烟樹，也草木皆兵了。「國事管他娘，且來作海浴吧！」娱樂救國主義者的一聲動員令，　女大衆便擁入「海濱飯店」的更衣室。卸了外套，旗衫····。一個個健美曲線的身體，齊臨幸軟綿綿的沙灘，作入水前的準備。</p>
<p>水天一色間，　增穿紅着綠的無數沐男浴女，好似展開了一幅圓畫，條條美人魚，載沉載浮，謔笑聲喧。驚動了白鷗，疑是戲水鴛鴦，迥旋在頂上。就浴者都感到「羽化登仙」之樂。</p>
<p>海水浴罷，上岸用清水冲洗，皎潔無垢。稍憇帆布椅上，仰天高歌。和牧童村姑的俚曲交奏。享日光浴的優益。傾倒手提箱内的汽水，麫包，零食，卽席野餐，狼呑虎咽，逸趣横生。優哉游哉：高橋之行也。</p>

<p>黃梅時節比大伏天還熱，據說是甲戌年，咸豐六年的大旱災又要重演了。曾祖母在時常說，咸豐六年是在潮河底裏唸佛求雨的，假如再等幾天還不下雨，我眞替家鄉以及許多地方的農民發愁。</p>
<p>江灣前天出會，目的據說也是祈雨，鑼鼓聲一陣響，房東說已經出到東横濱路來了。大家去看，我便也冒暑跟了去。</p>
<p>會丨儀仗，馬，菩蕯，紥肉香；景况和家鄉的大概差不多：只是會衆却漂亮得多，大都是香雲紗短衫褲，印度綢長衫，間或也有戴開工米新式草帽的，漂亮人物抬了菩蕯四處走，正如古老的虹廟蟄居在十足洋化的南京路上同樣的不恊調，（雖然他們是爲了求雨）。</p>
<p>看的人也像會衆們一樣，不怕熱，街道的旁邊擠得滿滿的。有些人更捧了香，非常處誠，想來是從旁贊助這盛舉的善士。我因爲頭有點昏，便悄悄地獨自一個人先回來了。</p>
<p>晚上，發了一陣風，有電光，也隱隱有雷的鳴聲，可是雨終没有下，會衆們的心想來是很失望的。</p>

<p>在這火傘高張的炎夏，在烈日下行走的人們，其熱固然不必說了，就是在屋子裏的人，也連嚷着熱！熱！現現在我想了幾種不必化錢的消暑方法，寫在下面：</p>
<p>常使心靜在熱天，大多數人的心，一定都是煩躁的，可是俗語說；「心靜自然凉，一所以必須先求必靜，處事綏和，自然能够滅輕熱度。</p>
<p>多看書畫看書讀畫，本是消遣長盡的良方，最好關於紀載寒冬的文字，和霜痕　影的圖畫，多多瀏覽，彷佛身歷其境；遍體生凉了。</p>
<p>互講故事公務餘閒，聚集好友，或是家人在一起，尤其是夏夜黃昏後，榻椅雜陳，科頭蹺足，互述有趣的故事，其時清風微拂，樂而忘倦，這也是平民化取凉的無上妙策</p>
<h3 id="c284">夏天的廣州 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>（一）游河</p>
<p>炎熱的夏天一到來，你在廣州的東堤南堤一帶，晚間便可以聴到一片嬌脆迷人的喊聲；「吊頸啊，（呌艇的諧音）先生！」喊出這種聲音的，是站立珠江河畔的珠娘們。</p>
<p>如果你看中了誰，儘可向伊勾搭兩句，或是講明了價錢，（普通是六角至一元半），你便可</p>
<p>跟珠娘下艇，在艇上過了舒服的一夜。但是照禁律，珠娘是不許賣弄的，所以你躺在艇頭的小甲板上，珠娘便只能坐在離你三二尺遠的地方；雖然手不能動，可是任何的言詞都由你說的，没有誰來干涉你。但是珠娘跟你說的話呢，總是千篇一律，不是說因爲贫窮出來當珠娘，便是現在需要某種衣飾，却苦於没錢好買。這種說話你聽來，似乎是眞情的，但是聽慣了，也就漸漸地付之一笑罷了！</p>
<p>（二）扒艇</p>
<p>廣州的荔枝灣，是早已名播國内的；你如果要扒艇，便可以到那兒去。但是扒艇不過是美其名而已，究實到荔枝灣去的，大多的目的只在於「索油」，）意即是說去看女人（。以前的荔枝灣是怎麽樣的，我可不明白，但是目前的荔枝灣却是與秦淮河無二，不過是一條流着濁奥的水的小河。這種小河却有許多要到那兒去的，而且精緻的游艇又是充塞其間，買艇粥的，冰淇淋的，生菓的也多到不可勝數，這當然是有很大的原因，那原因就是我說過的「索油」。</p>
<p>好去處！</p>
<p>（三）游泳游泳是成了廣州一般摩登男女的夏天運動。專業游泳來做買賣的公共游泳塲便有五家之多，其外私家的還有青年會的泳池，省立一中的泳池。</p>
<p>所謂五家公共泳塲，其中最熱閙的是水上游泳塲。全塲是用士敏土築造的：只有伸出河面的走廊，睡板等用木板竹篷造成。一到了水漲時間，不論白天黑夜，來游的青年男女，眞是多於過江之　！大家混在一個大泳塲里，本來是天下一件快樂的事，何况游罷起來，還有賣牛奶咖啡，湯炒麵粉，魚生粥之類的東西，所以夏天廣州的游泳塲所，眞是生意興隆！不過據說現在已限制男女共池游泳了，我想，今夏的泳塲定没以前的盛况了吧！</p>
<p>（四）沙面　　沙面是一個名詞，即是劃出給外國鬼子寄居的地方的名字。因爲是外國鬼子寄居的地方，而且又是位在西堤的一個小島，所以景緻美麗到無可言狀！當此炎熱的夏天，到沙面來散步的，乘凉的，也頗不乏人。尤其是晚上坐在沿河的舉岸上，望着圓滿的亮月，　着前面的珠江，珠江上的小經明燈，那種量物，也是很有詩趣的。</p>
<p>好在進沙面去，一來不要錢，二來也得到相當的自由，只要你不衣衫襤褸，守橋門的法國士兵，是没有柜　你的理由的，所以到這里乘凉散步的，無時不有。這也算是夏天的廣州的好去處哩！</p>
<p>除了游河，扒艇，游泳，到沙面去乘凉之外，廣州並不是没有好名勝，好去處，但那些都不適合夏天的，所以槪不論及！</p>

<h3 id="c285">粤省禁止男女共泳 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>男女間，到了現在，可算是不成問題了，婚姻制度，雖日尚存，但已等於「齊羅」，毫無意義，不過還有幾位無啥事做的朋友，還在那裏結婚離婚忙個不了。</p>
<p>這話我並不是杜撰的，就拿前日司法院公佈的離婚條件判例來看，已可知道婚姻制度的破產，其判例云，「所謂不堪同尼之虐待云者，不僅以身」</p>
<p>限，卽其精神上感有不堪同居之虐待。」若照這樣意義解釋起來，一方若要離婚，還怕無詞以藉口麽？這判例的對不對，不在此次討論範圍之内，我的舉此，只以證明夫妻之間，原没有多大關係罷了。</p>
<p>廣東爲我國最開通之省，亦爲開通最早之省，而其官吏的腦筋，冬烘得可笑，據前日報載，廣東最近禁止各游泳，又督配局長鄭日東，呈請行政會，禁男女道上執手同行又有什麽關係？定要禁止，是什麽意義呢？若照現在的趨勢說，明明是一件開倒車的事。</p>
<p>若拿粤省的政治來講，其爲害地方，何等深切，但是從没有聽見過預備去禁止，而男女同游，同行，爲害何在，何必定欲禁止他呢？眞所謂明足以察秋毫之末，而不見輿薪，爲政者最忌不從大處落墨，而於無關痛癢的事，偏要雷厲風行，這是近日爲政者最大的毛病。</p>
<p>男友社交公開，已成國律，旣經公開，則公開至若何程度，天然不能加以限止，「共泳」「執手」「亦是公開的一種方式。中國男女之間，所以成爲千古絕大的秘密奇觀，多因爲「男女受授不親」等虚僞理敎所束縛，以改造成了幾許風流寃案，若把西洋鏡一齊拆開，則男女間，猶如布帛菽粟，實屬平凡得很，還成什麽問題，故孟子日，食色性也，旣經是性，如何還那法律禮敎去裁判呢？法律理敎去裁判那裏還能發生效力呢？</p>
<p>私鹽越禁越好賣，就那男女社交未公開前來講，男女之間，果眞能以禮敎法律束縛了麽？則「幃簿不修」等事，好像賣報朋友所喊的「二十四種淫慾秘密樣樣多有」不必說，卽公開載於史册的，也不知多少，往往以家醜不可外揚，或中媾之言不可道也」的綠故，就此「捲了耳朶吃海蟄」，總算媽媽虎虎，揭過一篇賬，就算了事。</p>
<p>結婚已以自由爲原則，只要「我愛你，」就可算爲夫妻，則離婚亦必以自由爲原則，只要「我怨你，你怨我，」就可雙方脫離關係，故夫妻的結合，等於朋友的結合，所謂合則留，合不則去，夫妻之間，尚且如此，則共同游泳，與執手同行，有什麽關係呢？</p>
<p>法律只有跟着時代而前進的，若違反時代，强制執行的法律，雖亦不可硬幹一時，但其中緊張的狀態，擾攘的情形，亦决不可以持久，故爲政者不能力持大體，專於歧枝末節上用功夫，决决幹不出道理來。</p>
<h3 id="c286">公開的秘密 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>秘密是秘密，公開是公開，所以秘密公開之後，是不足爲奇了；但是日公開的秘密者，尚有三分秘密性存在也。　　抽大烟，法律所禁，抽烟的人大多秘而不宣，就是賣烟的所在，亦稱之「燕子窠」，大槪是鬼頭鬼腦的意思。不過大家的過這經騐罷，那條大名鼎鼎　的燕子窠里，在馬路上可以接觸着那股臭味，（抽大烟的人說是香味）據記者一位朋友，吃自家飯管人家事的負責調查，這里内除了一家洗衣作，一家烟兌店之外，是有門皆窠了。但是這秘密大家認爲是公開的秘密，這樣的例在上海是要多少有多少！</p>
<p>雖然目睹的人實在寥寥，大家的心目中倒底已有那樣一個百面小可的刑具底影響。據說帮票匪，强盜，到捕房之後没有口供，照例是在電刑上逼出來。這一類人的殺人越貨，自然可惡，受一點私用電刑，也不見十分過分。但是法律是應該賞罰分明的，如其一個不敢妄取人家一枚銅元的好好男子，我們姑試上了電刑，問他什麽案子什麽案子是你做的嗎，到那時候他寗願免除眼前的痛苦承認是强盜，是帮票匪，我想此種情形恐也是不能免的。</p>
<p>而法院審判一切案件呢，亦往往以捕房所呈之供詞，作爲定讞的標準。甚至許多被捕房威逼之後，想在法庭上求公正的裁判底反供都不得直。茲律師公會致第一特區法院院長貢獻意見書内謂：「翌朝庭訊，捕房卽以該供單呈之庭上，作爲被告自白之證據，庭上往往不察，卽將供單附卷，作爲判决之依據，嗣後被告雖欲申辯其是非，則以問官先入爲主，其效甚微，捕房之計於以大售，而電刑之用，亦於以大著」等語，律師和法庭接觸的機會較多，自然更比一般人明悉私刑之流弊甚巨，而且根據上文看來，好像法院之判决，都依據捕房的供單，則電刑之所以將秘密公開使用了。</p>
<p>爲人道計，爲租界上之法權計，我們從蔡洋其君一案，把這公開的秘密底刑具，應該認爲是一個嚴重的問題，爲以後無量數的不幸者請命！</p>

<p>— 洪</p>
<p>時候是薄暮五點鐘了，我踱出蒸籠似的火炙房子，沿着乂乂路向乂乂路折入乂乂路，到了乂乂里口，一眼看見兩個類似乞丐的勞工揪打做一團，團着看熱閙的不知多少，忽然樓上一個窗口裏倒下一盆冰水，正倒在互毆的兩個苦力身上，頭髮上水淋淋的，于是圍着看</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的一羣的視綫，便不約而同的移向那窗口。這時窗口裏現出了半個洋先生的笑臉，笑嘻嘻地，看的人都相率「乂倷娘」的駡，洋先生不懂，依樣笑嘻嘻地，互毆的苦力還在互毆，圍看的人越益多起來，陣圍更擴大了。</p>
<p>也許因爲這麽一來，使得那洋先生格外感到不痛快，活活的一幕喜劇竟無聲無響的平息了。于是洋先生妙想天開，從窗口裏丢下一方小麵包，果然活劇馬上復活起來，一羣乞丐搶做一團。旁邊的人看來，麵包並没有給人食得，分明被踐成了灰燼。洋先生在得意地笑，得意地揮手，轉頭君丐鵠望着洋先生，洋先生覺得這玩意兒還不差，更搬來了一大批的麵包擺在窗檻上，羣丐見了，大家都拍手。我遙望見那些麵包是一種綠菌色，準是霉壞了的，否則便總也是吃得不要了的殘餘。洋先生隔幾分鐘又擲下一方，羣丐也就隔幾分鐘又踐踏一團，結果洋先生的麵包擲完了，地上也就平添了厚厚的一層麵包屑。</p>
<p>于是洋先生的半個臉兒隱進去了，再不見有嘻嘻的笑聲與震雷似的鼓掌聲接着羣丐以没着熱閙的人也都在暮露的黃香散開了。</p>
<p>讀者，請記取！這就是一般洋先生對非高等華人的慷慨仗義及樂善好施所玩的一種舒胸騁懷的玩意兒呀！</p>

<p>— 穆琳</p>
<p>最近在一個聚餐席上遇見許多從前的老同學，問起他們的近况，都是滿不得意地說没有專幹，寫寫文章。</p>
<p>這現象我不覺深思了老半天。在一本什麽雜誌上一位批評家說中國近幾年來的文壇寂寞得像枯廟一樣，除了矛盾的「子夜」，是没有可以翻一翻的書了。老作爱彷彿隱士一般的幽居起來，新作家簡直不敢令人領敎！）大意（</p>
<p>雖然他說老作家的不肯努力，但是這文壇的領域上是不容我們作家涉足的。矛盾的子夜之外，别個老作家的作品也充塞在市上，）或才就是没有可翻一翻的書）然而對於新作家郤下了個「簡直不敢領敎」的斷語。同時也有人說過，我們文壇上是不分什麽老作家新作家的，有優秀的作品，新作家就是老作家，反是老作家不一定比新作家高明得多。</p>
<p>但是們瞧吧，一個新作家的名字剛在文壇上發現，他因了自已的「新」</p>
<p>那樣可憐地望着老作家的臉，更痛苦地等候着那些所謂批評家的鐵筆。自然我們也不能否認，新作家的作品是幼稚的，需要老作家的提携，需要批評家的指正。但不是傾軋，便是硬生生地把鐵圈箍住你的頭頸；於是中國的文壇寂寞得像枯廟一樣，老作家隱居起來。新作家簡直不敢令人領敎，矛盾的子夜代表了中國文壇。</p>
<p>這途徑顯然是路不通行了，但是年青人爲什麽　　　　　　　　　　　　　有事幹，這就是大學生的出路？</p>
<p>年青人趕快回頭跑罷，你們從敎授那裏學得來的東西，文壇上是不需要你們的，雖整個社會也正在排擠你們，但是把學得的恰如所適地應用，或者可以收一二分的成效。快回頭瞧罷！兩次的砲火已轟去了半壁山河，文人不過在跳舞塲裏喊而已，這責任還是在你們身上，那何必向着老作家和新作家分了兩道絕大鴻溝的文壇上努力呢？卽使你拍馬有功，登龍有術，擠上了寳座，也是否你們進大學的最初意志？</p>
<h3 id="c290">紫金箍與頭銜 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 石膽</p>
<p>嘗讀西遊記，裏面有個最活動的份子孫悟空，他本是一隻猿猴，只因通靈性，曾經閙過天宫，翻過地獄，一個觔斗能打去十萬八千里。不幸被觀音菩蕯看中了。要用他幚助唐僧到西方極樂世界去「取經」，就在他頭上套上一個漂亮的紫金箍，一面還對他說道：「猴子，你看，這多麽漂亮？你戴上這個罷。别人我還不給他戴呢。」猴子雖然能靈性，但究竟是畜類着到這東西金光燦爛的怪漂澆，就給戴上了。那可對不起，以後就永遠除不掉了，天宫也木想　，地獄也休想翻；十萬八千里大觔斗雖然間或還可以一打，但只限於在拯救他師父唐三藏的時候。你要亂打嗎？可以的，一通緊箍咒，賞你個倒栽葱從半天上吊下來。</p>
<p>現在文壇上也有了類乎紫金箍的兩件東西，便是：批評家高高擎起的圈子：和散文作家信手拈來的種種頭銜。　　最像的要推批評家手裏的圈子，上面鍍着金，也許和孫悟空頭上套着的紫金箍兒一樣漂亮。一個新進作家發表了一篇文章，我們的批評家必先拿圈子上去套一套，不合。於是說：「喂！小子，你這是不對的，意識不準確，而且藝術上也没有成功呀！小子，來吧，你跟着我，多好。」於是新進作家腦袋一伸，輕輕地鑽了進去。對不起，哼！你動，圈子緊緊地箍住，勒死你。至多給你搖搖旗，打打邊鼓，幚幾年閒。　　再說到散文作家信手拈來的頭銜，</p>
<h3 id="c291">廢話連篇 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>夏天有的人熱得要命還要做事，有的人不做事也不熱，有時還因爲太過凉快了傷風。</p>
<p>富貴人家在凉快的地方做事，消遣，娱樂，所以他穿了整齊的漂亮的衣服；可是因爲自已穿了整齊的漂亮的衣服，一看到窮人們在熱得要命的時候脫了衣服着膀背，厭惡地說，「眞是不講究衛生。」　　坐在汽車裏頭兜風的人，看見路邊走路的人一頭汗而覺得奇怪：坐在黃包車上面的人大呌黃包車夫「熱得很，快點，」他們都是好像不知道人家比較他自已還熱得很。　　電車司機人碰着黃包車阻碍他的電車的開駛，駡一聲「猪獨」；黃包車夫碰着獨輪小車阻碍他的進行，駡一聲「猪　」，推獨輪小車的碰到小癟三呌化子阻碍他的路，也駡一聲「猪獨」，！人類都是喜歡使用自已的威權。</p>
<p>舞女看不起妓女，電影女明星看不起舞女，女醫生却看不起電影女明星，其實從婦女職業的觀點上看來，半斤等於八兩，大家都是爲的服務社會養活自已。妓女也是服務社會的人，你反對麽？某市公開的宣布，妓女開禁是繁榮市面的唯法明。</p>
<p>那也和紫金箍有同樣的作用，也是套在頭上的。當散文作家要跟誰筆戰之前，必須先拈若干如「學者」，「名流」，「大師一，「老爺」，「敎授」，「權威」等類的頭衔，重重的向你頭上一壓，一面將你推上一把寳座，暗暗用根繩子，將你連同寳座吊上半天，於是他便揮動「毛錐子」或挺康克令金筆尖，在你身上一陣亂刺。你覺得痛麽？只好忍信不動。動一動，便從半天上吊下來。你要回手嗎？「哼亅推下去，跌死他。」</p>

<h3 id="c293">那裏有結婚的希望 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在這汗流如雨的暑天，實在不該再來煩擾先生，不過這事情是緊逼着，又想於最短時間内解决，所以不得不勞煩先生。原諒，原諒。</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，他於二年前同他同學的妹妹彼此由仰慕而發生愛情；不過這愛情是很純潔的，他們祇談過幾次話，並且散過幾次步而已。據他對我說，他們愛慕的原因是因爲她的脾氣好，思想行爲，都與現代崇尚虚榮的女子不同，並且能忍苦耐勞，而她愛他則爲了他不是紈袴子弟，人頗忠誠樸實。</p>
<p>這樣看來，他們的精神已是一致，應當進行其第二步訂婚手續了。但問題就發生在這上頭，他是個無產階級，那里有結婚的希望？他覺得自已的職業，常是朝不保夕的搖動着，未來的個人生活，正不知如何安排，他怎敢貿然與她結婚，以致遺下將來無窮的痛苦。他不願做背了良心不負責任的丈夫，他不願她嫁了他而喪失好未來的幸福。因此，他雖十二分的愛她，仍沒有和她訂婚。這是有不得已的苦衷的。</p>
<p>但是她的家庭已不容許她過女兒的生活了，常常逼她去嫁。她因爲鍾情於他，所以每次都拒絕，前星期，她的母親又對她說：「王先生的性情學問都不錯，）其實她自已一點都不知（而且我也問過神，卜過卦，他們都說你的年生八字和他很配，不如擇了黃道吉日去會一面罷。一她又不理，於是她母親大不歡喜，嚴詞厲色，威嚇她道：「這個又不中意，那個又不中意，偏偏的愛他，他現在又不能結婚，待你等到他能結婚的時候，要是不與你結婚，那你怎樣辦啊！」她將這事告訴他，徵求他的意見。他很坦白的說：「我現在無能結婚，我不忍因不能結婚而結婚，致毁滅你的青春。戀愛不一定是要結婚，就算萬一你被迫而嫁了，我們的交情也不會因此而喪失。怕什麽呢？　　她聽罷這段結論，心上狐疑不定，發生了三種不同的猜想！㈠哀求他答應將來愛她，那麽她寗願不計時日的「完璧以待，」婚後尤願同甘苦而不怨，㈡以爲他是忘情負義的。㈢絕對消極主義，任家庭盲目的支配，自怨命薄。他也沒有一定的趨向：㈠答應她，恐怕經濟不能負担。㈡放棄她，又不忍。（因爲這種女子實鮮有）㈢再延下去，恐怕辜負了她的青春。</p>
<p>編者先生，他心中的矛盾，困難怎樣解决呢？答應她呢？還是拒絕她呢？是不是應做薄情人呢？無產階級是不是都無談戀愛，享性慾的權利與義務？以學識淺陋的我，怎能代他解决呢？祇有請求先生代他想一個合情合理的辦法，因爲她的母親强迫她去要求他澈底的答復呢。無任感謝，順頌撰安。余士无上。</p>
<p>答：在現代的社會關係下，結婚的擔荷確是一般依仗薪傭爲生的人最大的憂慮。每個沒有結婚的青年男子，心中時常會幻象自已將來的甜蜜家庭樂境，更無時無刻不希望獲得一個美麗動人，性情契合，能够彼此安慰的妻子，但想現實的生活的窘迫，心却全冷了。不錯，爲了職業的不穩經濟的窘迫，若毫無遠慮貿然去結婚的確是很危險的，然而，不結婚生活就不困難麽？失業後個人的生活不是一樣的沒法「安排」麽？這樣，結婚不結婚，又有什麽分别呢？生活都是很困難的，都是須要我們去努力爭扎奮鬭的。所以，你的朋友因爲自已窮困，恐怕喪失她未來的幸福，而不敢答應與她結婚，居心固然可嘉，但這種消極的態度，實際上於他們是毫無益處的。室家之好是人類自然的慾望，他是否能眞正抑制住而不往不正當的方面去謀滿足呢？這大槪是不可能的。旣不可能，則母寗求正當的滿足，卽結婚了。</p>
<p>至於你所說的「無產階級是不是無談戀愛，享性慾的權利與義務？」我覺得問題是不應這樣提出的。因爲無產階級不能談戀愛，享性慾，是他們的物質條件上不可能，被社會關係把他們束縛住了，並非是沒有這項權利。因此，一般無力結婚的人，不應該爲了生活的束縛而消極的避免結婚，不結婚也依然解决不了生活，而是積極的衝破和活困難的重圍，使結婚不受生活困難的牽制。使我們生活困難的是社會的原因，與結婚並無關係。所以，照我的意思，你朋友的愛人，如果眞是個能「同共甘苦而不怨」的人，你朋友是不能爲了經濟困難而「拒絶」她的。編者</p>

<h3 id="e1">Kong Xiangxi Discusses the Revision of Tax Regulations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) (Kong Xiangxi discusses revising import tariffs. The Ministry of Finance hired several experts who, after six months of research, completed the revisions with utmost care. There is absolutely no reason for the Ministry of Finance to disadvantage itself. As for the various goods, some are used as reciprocal items. For example, Chinese grass linen is sold in other countries and subjected to the highest tax rates. If we want to ask other countries to lower this import tax, then our country cannot reduce some import taxes for reciprocity. Moreover, the reduced printed and dyed cotton textiles are all things that our country does not have and are not widely sold. Shanghai merchants are requesting the cancellation of this tax regulation, which is actually due to a lack of research. In short, this revision of import tariffs is extremely beneficial to our country. I have always been very concerned about commerce and would never want to put domestic merchants in a desperate situation. After I go to Shanghai, I also plan to take the opportunity to meet with business leaders to explain in detail. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yongnian, after coming to Beiping with Kong Xiangxi, was immediately ordered to investigate the customs situation in Hebei province. After completing the investigation in Beiping, he went to Tianjin and Qinhuangdao to investigate. He has now returned to Beiping and is drafting a report to submit to the Ministry of Finance regarding the customs situation. The customs revenue of various customs offices in North China has indeed increased recently, but the reason is the increase in tax rates, not the development of customs affairs. (13th Dispatch)</p>

The Construction Department requested the provincial government to allocate more than 29,000 yuan in advance for rescue. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the tracks of the Ping-Sui Railway near Qixiaying were washed away by water some days ago, the engineering section tried its best to repair them, and traffic was restored on the 11th. On the 12th, flash floods broke out again at Fongshengzhuang and Sandao Yingjian, rushing down like a torrent. The roadbed was washed away again, and houses and fields along the road were submerged, causing extremely heavy losses. The Pingdiquan engineering section has sent workers to repair it. The 1303307 down trains are all returning to Beiping from Pingdiquan. It is expected that traffic will be restored by the afternoon of the 14th. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Japanese military officer Chiba Yama is scheduled to leave Beiping for Changchun in about a week to seek instructions from the Kwantung Army regarding the negotiation policy on war zone issues. At that time, Yin Tong, after meeting with Huang, may take a boat directly from Shanghai to Dalian, then transfer to Changchun to meet with Chiba Yama and the Kwantung Army to directly negotiate on issues such as the abolition of the Tanggu Agreement, the entry of security teams into the war zone, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various passes of the Great Wall, and the takeover of Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs. All will be proposed for overall discussion. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that the date for the takeover of Malanyu has not yet been decided. The automobile road between Beiping and Malanyu has not yet been restored since it was washed away by the water, causing the delay in the departure of our personnel. If the weather gradually improves, we will find a way to send responsible persons to take over within a few days. In the future, regarding the post-disaster problems, we will first start with local construction, such as road repairs and the construction of long-distance telephones, which are all planned to be actively carried out. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming left Beiping this morning to return to Tangshan to take office. According to him, this trip will be directly back to Tangshan, and he does not intend to delay in Tianjin. There have been no results in the negotiations on war zone issues so far. Huang may return north in the short term, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. No reports have been received from Pingfang. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the previous report that Malanyu would be taken over on the 18th is not true. There is no so-called takeover. Our administrative organization is complete, and the Xinglong County magistrate is also working locally. The reason why we cannot unify the political power is that the presence of 200 Japanese troops and a battalion of puppet troops protecting the Qing tombs restricts us. If these two units of troops are withdrawn, I can administer as I wish. The report of the takeover is an overstatement. This afternoon, Tao Shangming came to Tianjin from Beiping and went to the provincial government to visit Yu Xuezhong to report the results of the war zone issues discussed with Chiba Yama in Beiping. He will return to Tangshan tonight. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Yutian Security Team has not yet been reduced to the number of 1,000 stipulated by the province. Special Agent Captain Feng Shouchang has more than four times that number. He is extremely at odds with the old troops of Shi Yousan. Captain Han Zexin has no command ability and allows them to fight each other. Feng recently accused Han's followers of being illegal outside and requested the province to severely punish them. Yu Xuezhong plans to transfer Han back to the province and appoint a clever and capable officer. He is currently looking for a successor. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lei, the commander of the Second Security Regiment in the Tangshan war zone, is at odds with his subordinate battalion commander, Miao Zuoxin. The two rely on the power of the Japanese behind them to try to remove their enemies. Zhao Lei obtained the assistance of the Tangshan Japanese military captain and disarmed and reorganized Miao's troops. Miao himself was protected by his Japanese friend and fled elsewhere.

This morning, when it passed through Tianjin to Shenyang, in addition to a dozen foreign passengers in the first and second class who were going to Beidaihe for summer vacation, there were fewer than 50 passengers in the four third-class passenger cars.

<p>Hebei Provincial Government Has Detailed Suggestions (Tianjin) According to investigations, the Japanese troops stationed along the Beining Line and the Great Wall Line include: one squadron each in Luan County, Changli, and Funing; two squadrons each in Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Haiyangzhen, and Tanggu; one squadron in Gubeikou; and one battalion in Yuguan. The above belong to the jurisdiction of the North China Garrison Army. Malanyu, Saheqiao, Jianchangying, and Xifengkou each have two squadrons; Panjiakou and Lengkou each have one squadron; and Yiyuan Kou has one platoon. The above belong to the jurisdiction of the Kwantung Army. In the negotiations, our side requires the Japanese troops on the Beining Line to withdraw to the troop stationing locations stipulated in the Boxer Protocol, and the number of personnel must also be reduced. The Kwantung Army stationed at various passes along the Great Wall has no treaty basis and should be completely withdrawn. The provincial government has detailed suggestions on this matter and will send them as a reference for negotiations after Huang Fu returns. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet police headquarters of Gubeikou South Pass has not yet withdrawn because the houses outside the pass have not been built. The puppet customs at the North Pass continues to collect import taxes as usual. Yin Tixin, due to the floods in the war zone, has many bridges washed away, turning the plains into canals. He is currently discussing with Tao Shangming to raise funds to purchase materials to repair the bridges and has sent a letter to the Beining Railway Bureau to send personnel to investigate. They can depart within a few days. (13th Dispatch)</p>

About 400 people participated, divided into attacking and defending teams. Machine guns were set up on the roofs of civilian houses, with shouts of killing. Traffic was cut off.

<h3 id="e28">May the Countrymen Pay Attention to the Locust Plague Amidst the Drought! <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been exceptionally hot. Along the Yangtze River, there has been little rainfall, causing crops to wither and rivers to dry up. Recent reports of drought and famine have come from dozens of counties in six provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, and Shaanxi. Disaster relief associations have been established in the affected areas, and superstitious practices such as banning slaughter and praying for rain are also widespread. However, the focus of everyone's attention is still on drought prevention. Based on past experience, the locust plague this year is feared to break all previous records and pose a great threat to farmers. We must not focus on one thing and lose sight of the other.</p>
<p>Why is this year's locust plague particularly alarming? The biggest reason is the close relationship between drought and locust plagues. Ancient records often mention "great locusts after prolonged drought" and "famine after great drought and locusts," which is clear evidence. We know that locusts are afraid of dampness, which can cause locust eggs to rot and prevent them from hatching. Conversely, if the soil is dry and there is little moisture, then the chances of locusts breeding increase. The four months of May, June, July, and August are the most important period for locust plagues. According to last year's locust plague statistics, the turn of June and July is when the most outbreaks occur. Currently, it is mid-July, and the extreme heat and drought are unprecedented. Therefore, it is inevitable that autumn nymphs have already appeared. After the appearance of autumn nymphs, it takes about twenty days for them to fully grow and turn into "autumn locusts." If we do not take preventive measures immediately, the severity of the locust plague will undoubtedly far exceed that of previous years.</p>
<p>Last year's locust plague affected a total of ten provinces, including Hebei, Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang, Hunan, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, covering 231 counties. Although the disaster was not as severe as in 1929, the affected area still reached about 18 million acres. Losses in agricultural products amounted to 20 million yuan. At the beginning of June this year, the Ministry of Industry, in order to "learn from the past and be careful in the future," convened a locust control conference for seven provinces. However, concrete results have yet to be seen due to time and funding constraints. However, the signs of this year's locust plague have already become very clear. According to recent reports, the spread of locusts in Jiangsu Province has already affected more than twenty counties, including Jintan and Yixing. If they are not eradicated early, even without the disaster of drought demons, the autumn harvest will be hopeless. Therefore, amidst the calls for drought prevention, we must not forget locust prevention under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Speaking of methods for controlling locusts, the best known is to cultivate wasteland. Because locust eggs grow underground, usually within one or two inches of the soil. Cultivated land will inevitably involve tilling, plowing, and digging, which will either kill the locust eggs in one fell swoop or turn them to the surface, where they will be eaten by birds and other animals or baked to death by the sun, preventing them from hatching into locust nymphs. Reclaiming wasteland to save the country is a fashionable slogan that everyone likes to talk about. What's more, it also has the benefit of controlling locusts. Isn't that killing two birds with one stone? However, this kind of work requires being "prepared for a rainy day." It is too late to "cling to Buddha's feet in a crisis." Besides, even if it's not too late, few people will actually do it. Therefore, as a second-best option, we can only adopt stopgap measures, such as digging ditches and catching locusts, which have been commonly used in our country and have yielded considerable results. However, this year, amidst the great drought, ordinary farmers are suffering from a lack of rain and are already overwhelmed. It is difficult for them to spare any more energy to take care of the locust plague. In that case, assistance from government officials and social organizations is an inescapable duty.</p>
<p>Some may say that this year the crops are withered, so even if there are locusts, they cannot eat the withered seedlings. Eating the withered seedlings will not necessarily add another layer of loss to farmers who have already gone bankrupt. This view is wrong. Because if there is insufficient rainfall, irrigation methods can be used to salvage the situation. If the crops are withered, drought-resistant crops such as buckwheat and mung beans can be replanted, or the planting of second-season rice can be promoted and late rice varieties selected to supplement the losses. In other words, if we can do our best to find ways, we can still reverse the situation and fight against the will of heaven for the lives of the people. We should not give up hope. Therefore, in the face of severe drought, it is even more necessary for us to prevent locust plagues. Otherwise, if the lives of the people snatched from the hands of the drought demons are still devoured by small locusts, all the hard work of drought prevention will have been in vain.</p>
<p>In countries with political systems on the right track, the central government and local authorities pay great attention to locust control. The development and migration direction of locusts in a region can be predicted from the records of climate change and the ecology of locust species over the years. With the certainty of prediction, preventive measures can be implemented to eliminate the breeding opportunities of migratory locusts. Our past achievements in locust control cannot be compared with those of other countries. However, the seriousness with which the Hebei Provincial Government carried out locust control last year was commendable. The seven-province locust control conference convened by the Ministry of Industry has long since closed. We are eagerly awaiting the "new strategies" for locust control after the closing. Now is the critical moment for locust control. We sincerely hope that government officials will not disappoint us.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Gas Explosion</p>
<h3 id="e50">Investigation and Assessment Report Released <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The committee investigating the explosion at the Hong Kong Southern China Gas Company's gas plant in Sai Wan on May 14, which resulted in the deaths of 42 people, has released its investigation and assessment report today after hearing testimony from all parties for 17 days. The report states that the cause of the explosion was gas leakage. The outer skin of the gas storage tank had corroded over the years, leading to gas leakage. When the gas detector fell, it created a spark that ignited the gas. The gas company followed the usual practices of the industry in maintaining the gas detector and expected the gas storage tank to last for 40 to 50 years without conducting a material study. This method may be satisfactory in temperate climates, but in Hong Kong, it seems appropriate to further study internal maintenance methods and conduct inspections at any time.

<p>**Gold and Silver:** London gold prices rose by one penny this morning due to demand, with a listed price of 138 shillings and sixpence.</p>
<p>**London Silver:** Before the Silver Fixing Committee meeting, brokers believed that today's silver price would be no different from yesterday's, or one to two five lower. This speculation was close to accurate. The spot listed price was 20 pence and 5625, and the futures price was 20 pence and 6875, both down 1875 from yesterday's price. The last transaction in London yesterday was at a futures price of 20 pence and 9375, so today's actual drop was 25. This was due to selling from China. India purchased slightly. With low prices, sentiment is still stable.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Declaration</p>
<h3 id="e63">Endorsing Russia's Entry into the League of Nations, Adopting Italy's Neutral Stance on Eastern European Pacts, Aligning with Britain <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(London) In today's House of Commons discussion on foreign affairs, Foreign Secretary Simon declared that if European nations were to form alliances to contend with each other, Britain would remain aloof and impartial. This policy was clearly communicated to French Foreign Minister Barthou during his recent visit to London, and the French Foreign Minister expressed unconditional agreement. Based on this, we will not undertake any new obligations.</p>
<p>Simon further stated that Britain supports Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations. This marks the first formal expression of this from the British side. The issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations has been heavily discussed by France and Italy, while Britain has remained conspicuously silent. Therefore, Britain's stance has long been a mystery. Some even predicted that Britain would oppose it, fearing that the expansion of Soviet international influence would revive Britain's past fears of the spread of communism in China, India, and its Far Eastern territories. Such rumors are now dispelled by Simon's statement.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon concluded by announcing that he had just received a telegram from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that Italy agrees with Britain and expresses sympathy towards the Eastern European Pact. )National Telegram, 13th(</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon declared in the House of Commons today that Great Britain has not expanded its responsibilities in any way. The main issue discussed during French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to England was France's proposal for a mutual assistance pact. This pact includes the Baltic states, Soviet Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. France also proposed that this pact should be similar to the Locarno Treaty. Furthermore, it stipulates that if Soviet Russia faces circumstances that would enable the Locarno Treaty to be implemented, it guarantees France and Germany. France also proposed guaranteeing respect for Soviet Russia's borders to Russia and guaranteeing respect for Germany's eastern borders to Germany. Simon continued that Britain cannot encourage or provide moral support to any new arrangements between European countries, as such arrangements are selective in nature and aim to create a bloc to counter another bloc. Britain has not assumed any new obligations but is prepared to warmly welcome Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations, which is an important aspect of the French proposal. The British government believes that if a new pact of mutual guarantee including Germany can be established, negotiations can be reopened to conclude a pact that stipulates the appropriate implementation of the principle of German equality under the security system aimed at by the Disarmament Conference. The French government has agreed to this concept and has been permitted to communicate this to Germany, which has already been done. The British government believes that an Eastern mutual guarantee pact concluded based on strict mutual principles is worthy of support by the British government and people. Italy, understanding that this Eastern pact does not contain new missions, also welcomes it. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain rose to commend Foreign Secretary Simon's statement, saying that he believed Barthou's visit to Britain had yielded results and that he enthusiastically supported the proposal for an Eastern pact, hoping that Germany could join it. Lord Privy Seal Eden, in concluding this debate, expressed the government's gratitude to all parties in the House of Commons for accepting the policy outlined by Foreign Secretary Simon. The debate then concluded.)Reuters Telegram, 13th(</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, the House of Commons convened to discuss foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Simon delivered a statement, briefly stating that Britain has never favored European countries dividing into blocs and engaging in mutual antagonism, but the British government is happy to support all measures within the framework of a collective system that are sufficient to achieve peace. All Eastern European pacts should involve Russia, and Russia should participate in Eastern European pacts as a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, Britain expresses its warm approval for the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations. In addition, Simon reiterated that although Britain supports the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, Britain has not assumed any new obligations in Europe. Simon also reported to the House of Commons that the British government has instructed its ambassadors to various European countries to separately present the nature of the regional mutual assistance pact proposed by France to the governments concerned, and to request that each government use all its powers to achieve the success of this pact. Simon also stated that the British government has now received a reply from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, expressing approval. In his reply, the Italian Prime Minister stated that Italy is a signatory to the Locarno Treaty, so its attitude is naturally the same as Britain's. In other words, if the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact does not increase new obligations for Italy, Italy will naturally be happy to support it. Furthermore, Italy is willing to consider with sympathy all measures taken on a mutual basis, especially if such measures are sufficient to open up new paths for the Disarmament Conference and allow equal rights for armaments to be implemented, the Italian government will be even happier to consider it. )Havas Telegram, 13th(</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Origins of the Eastern Locarno Pact Are Based on a Russian-French Alliance, Purely Defensive in Nature <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today's Paris Echo publishes an important article that sheds light on the origins of the Eastern Locarno Agreement, which is currently the most widely discussed topic. The author of the article is signed as Paulina. The article clearly states that the origins of the Eastern Locarno Agreement are indeed based on a political and military alliance between Russia and France. Paulina claims that since the autumn of last year, Soviet Russia has proposed an alliance to France no fewer than six times. By the sixth time, France could no longer refuse, partly fearing that Moscow would turn to Berlin to restore the old Rapallo Treaty. The reason why all regional agreements are necessary is to ensure that Soviet Russia's conditions are fully consistent with those stipulated in Geneva. According to Geneva's regulations, all regional agreements must be concluded on a mutual basis and without excluding any other countries. Therefore, even if Germany, Italy, and Poland were to oppose the Eastern Locarno Agreement in the future, France could still continue to find ways to bring together Soviet Russia, the Little Entente countries, the Balkan countries, and the Baltic countries to form a complete organization. Paulina further claims that these connections are purely defensive in nature, as France is striving to ensure that Berlin and Rome do not refuse to join hands. )National Telegram, 12th(</p>

<p>(Berlin) German newspapers continue to comment on the results of Barthou's visit to London. The Politische Auslands-Korrespondenz (Political Foreign Correspondence) briefly stated that since the French Foreign Minister had triumphed over MacDonaldism in London, any country that dared to oppose France's proposed treaty policy would inevitably face diplomatic attacks. This is what we can foresee. The newspaper also stated that if Britain follows France to a considerable extent in its policy towards Germany and Italy, its future will be full of thorns. The Berliner Tageblatt published the views of its London correspondent, briefly stating, "The British view the expression of friendship between Britain and France as the main result of the London talks, and in fact, relations between the two countries have never been as friendly as they are today since the end of the European War. In recent weeks, people of any class in Britain have not failed to harbor anti-German sentiments, while at the same time expressing closeness to France." The newspaper concluded, "Germany's international political situation is indeed serious, but not without hope, because Germany still has a guarantee in hand. What is the guarantee? That is, Britain must rely on Germany to maintain peace in Europe; otherwise, there is no hope for the recovery of the British economy." )Havas Telegram, 12th(</p>

<p>)Berlin( Prussian Prime Minister Göring addressed a meeting of prosecutors and state lawyers today, demanding unconditional support for Chancellor Hitler and issuing warnings against judicial criticism of the government's recent actions. Göring earnestly hoped that Hitler would create absolute order in the Nazi state, defend the nation in every way, and resist all attacks. This is the responsibility of those listening to his speech today. Justice and the will of our leader are one and the same; this is the justice that the audience must uphold. Göring continued, saying that he would personally support those who fulfill their duties and severely punish those who neglect their duties. The actions of the leaders on June 30th were the highest realization of justice and the best feeling of justice. Therefore, all sectors must not allow it to be subjected to severe tests again. The clean air that the leaders' actions have already cleared should be maintained by all comrades, and they should act according to the law and the needs of the leader and the nation, without showing any favoritism. )Reuters Telegram, 12th(</p>
<p>(Berlin) Aviation Minister General Göring, after the recent coup, convened the prosecutors of the Prussian provinces. Before the Central Minister of Justice Gürtner and the Chief of Secret Police Himmler, he clarified the concept of law, saying, "National Socialism can only have one concept of law, that is, the concept determined by Chancellor Hitler himself." Göring also said that Hitler wanted everyone in the National Socialist state to absolutely abide by discipline, and all prosecutors should protect the state in their duties and severely punish those who attack the state and Chancellor Hitler. After the incident of June 30th, when the Chancellor quelled the rebellion, people felt uneasy, but now normalcy has been restored. Some advocates of extreme legalism say that everything can be destroyed, but the law must be maintained. We cannot agree with this. We National Socialists believe that the people are the beginning of everything, and the law is made by the people themselves. The Chancellor has said that in a country, the law and the will of the people are exactly the same. Therefore, no one can give the law the nature of an enemy state. Göring continued that the June 30th incident relieved Germany of its greatest danger. The reason why it was able to do so was due to the swift actions of Hitler and his representatives. He said, "The actions of the National Socialist authorities in these days are a manifestation of the conscience and law of the German people. Therefore, this action is entirely proper. No one has the right to review it afterward. This action is also extremely clean. No one has the right to oppose the Chancellor for personal reasons, soiling his clean action. Anyone who opposes it, no matter who they are, will be severely punished. Those who fabricate rumors should also be severely punished. In short, there is only one concept of law, that is, the concept determined by the Chancellor." )Havas Telegram, 12th(</p>

<p>Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the current Polish Minister of National Defense, is a founding father of Poland. He had a connection with Japan thirty years ago during the Russo-Japanese War. The following is a narrative: At that time, Piłsudski was a member of a secret political organization, engaging in disturbances within the territory of the old Russian Empire, seeking independence for Poland. However, due to the unfavorable situation, he had to leave the Russian border. Piłsudski had a friend named Filipowicz, who later served as the Polish Ambassador to the United States, and was then a fellow socialist fighter with Piłsudski. He was on good terms with the Japanese. Piłsudski was introduced by him and became acquainted with Utsunomiya, the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in London. Utsunomiya then invited Piłsudski and Filipowicz to visit Japan. Piłsudski originally intended to provide Japan with information about the Russian army in exchange for obtaining Japanese military equipment and ammunition to assist the Polish Independence Party, so he made the trip to Japan. He landed in Yokohama on July 10, 1904, when the Russo-Japanese War was in full swing, exactly thirty years ago. Later, in Tokyo, Piłsudski met with Japanese Generals Murata and Inoue Toshio. Inoue Toshio was the first Japanese Minister to Poland after Poland's founding. Piłsudski's meeting with the two was quite harmonious, but there were no concrete results. When Piłsudski was about to return to his country, a few days before his departure, Japanese General Inagaki told him, "The Japanese government is probably unwilling to take any action politically for Poland. Japanese soldiers are very willing to have relations with the Polish independence movement." After this remark, Japanese officers in Switzerland soon trained Polish people with military technical knowledge. Therefore, when Piłsudski left Japan to return to his country, he not only had no resentment, but also had some gratitude. )Havas Telegram, 12th(</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry today issued a lengthy statement regarding Britain's protest against the closure of Antung port to seagoing vessels and its request to reopen the Yalu River railway bridge for ship passage. It stated that Britain has absolutely no reason to protest. The Korean government announced on January 31st that the Yalu River railway bridge would no longer be opened for ship passage after March 15th. British Ambassador to Tokyo, Clive, applied in June to continue this convenience, based on a 1910 Japanese government document stating that the construction of the bridge would not interfere with British trade rights in the Antung port with China, as granted by the 1903 Sino-American Treaty. The Foreign Ministry stated that such a treaty has no right to bind a third party, and Japan believes it has no responsibility to maintain the opening of the bridge. Furthermore, the Yalu River seabed has changed, and seagoing vessels can no longer sail to the Sandotu (transliteration) area seven miles below Antung. Therefore, there is no need to open the bridge. Moreover, the bridge has been in existence for twenty years, and the bridge machinery is dilapidated, requiring a large sum of money for repairs. The Korean government's declaration on January 31st was based on economic reasons.</p>

(National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>San Francisco Business in San Francisco is increasingly grinding to a halt, and the momentum of the general strike movement is worsening. Transportation between Oakland and San Francisco was completely cut off this morning. 4,000 workers have joined the strike, and 2,000 boilermakers have also gone on strike, so work in shipyards and railway factories cannot proceed. All dyeing factories have been closed, and slaughterhouses will also cease operations at 6 p.m. on Saturday due to the slaughterhouse union's declaration of a strike. Electrical workers and streetcar repair workers are scheduled to start striking at 10 a.m. this morning. Drivers and ticket sellers must vote again on Sunday to decide. All businesses will be severely affected. Because of the streetcar shutdown, many workers and clerks who work in San Francisco but live in the east will either have to stop working or stay in the city. It is said that the general strike movement is the most severe today since the International Longshoremen's Association declared a strike on May 9th. With the support of workers in various industries, dockworkers and sailors are expected to reject the arbitration proposal of the government mediator, which was accepted by the employers yesterday. A majority of the 129 unions here have approved the general strike, but it depends on the final order of the Central Labor Executive Department.

<h3 id="e87">Inside Story of the Okada Cabinet Formation <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>No Different Than Extending the Life of the Saito Cabinet According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun, the sudden emergence of General Keisuke Okada to form a cabinet was truly unexpected by the world. The reason for this actually came from Saito's own intention and was related to the so-called crisis approaching in 1936 and the fundamental policies to address diplomacy and national defense. Okada served as the Minister of the Navy in the Tanaka and Saito cabinets. At the time of the conclusion of the London Naval Treaty, he served as a military councilor, being an intermediate figure mediating between the hardliners (Military Affairs Bureau system) and the treaty faction (Ministry of the Navy system) within the Navy. He was quite confident in overcoming the naval difficulties. However, the young officers regarded him as a treaty faction and were mostly dissatisfied. In fact, he did not lean towards any faction. When the naval treaty was concluded, Navy Minister Takarabe and Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki had already joined forces, making it difficult to break through. The young officers then criticized him as a treaty faction. When Saito was about to resign at the end of June and recommended Okada as his successor, the so-called treaty faction prevented the Chief of the Naval General Staff from making a memorial to the Emperor, but Admiral Suzuki Kantaro, the Chief of Staff, strongly disagreed. Because Suzuki and Okada were relatives—Okada's daughter married Suzuki—the two were quite close. Saito and Okada also had a close relationship as seniors and juniors. This was one personal reason for the recommendation. Secondly, the difficulty of the disarmament conference was imminent. Saito and Suzuki were both naval admirals. If they were too tough, they could not avoid a rupture of the international crisis. Therefore, elder statesmen all valued this. When Saito recommended Okada, Prince Saionji considered it appropriate, and other senior officials had no objections. This was because Okada was rich in compromise. If they wanted to overcome the difficulties of the disarmament conference, they had to resort to compromise. Even if the hardliners and young officers were dissatisfied with him, Okada himself had the magnanimity to deal with it. Moreover, his attitude was very firm. If the young officers made things difficult for him, he would angrily say, "If you do not trust me, please kill me!" This point was well known to Saito. Therefore, Okada's appearance could ease the hardliners within the Navy and break through the international crisis. Moreover, Okada's wealth of compromise had been proven during the Saito cabinet.</p>
<p>He resigned as Minister of the Navy, allowing Osumi to succeed him, and his willingness to live a leisurely life was originally for the reason of stopping disputes. However, even if he wanted to extend his position, it was not impossible, and many people hoped that he would continue to serve, but he refused. Furthermore, the hardliners, such as the anti-treaty faction within the Navy, pursued the Seiyukai for responsibility for violating the treaty. For example, in the temporary parliament of the seventh year, a major crisis occurred between the government and the Seiyukai due to the rice problem. Okada defended Saito and worked hard. Furthermore, when Hatoyama, a cabinet member from the Seiyukai, resigned as Minister of Education, Mori Kaku and Okada's compromise appeased the Seiyukai and allowed the parliament to pass. From these three points of view, Okada was not only rich in compromise but also Saito's mediator. Therefore, Saito deeply admired his ability and persuaded him. Therefore, Okada's cabinet formation was no different than extending the life of the Saito cabinet.</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence The newly编战区 special police team of Hebei Province has been waiting in Caicun, Cangxian, to be dispatched to Luan East for two months. Due to the issue of firearms and personnel numbers, the Japanese side has not agreed, resulting in no date for departure. In an instant, the green gauze curtains will rise, and the banditry atmosphere in Luan East will intensify. The war zone security teams stationed in various places are small in number, and due to the early change of guard, the military is eager to return home, which inevitably leads to a slight slackening in maintaining law and order. In various counties and towns, due to the pervasive atmosphere of drugs, families are ruined and more and more people become bandits. If the green gauze curtains rise, it will be an opportunity for them to gather and rob. The provincial authorities are deeply concerned about the security within the war zone and sincerely hope that this issue can be resolved quickly so that the special police team can be dispatched east and put its newly sharpened skills to the test. With a large number of people, it can achieve the effect of suppressing banditry. However, although we urgently seek a solution to this matter, the Japanese benefit from its delay. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming have negotiated with Shibayama several times, but they have been told, "This is a matter for the Kwantung Army, you can contact the military headquarters directly." Yin, in essence, was a key figure in the Tanggu Truce Agreement. The principles for the編战区 special police team were agreed upon orally by both sides, and Yin participated in the discussions. Previously, Huang Fu instructed Yin to negotiate with the Japanese, but Yin was busy with the through-train incident and did not have time for this. When the Chadian train bombing incident occurred, Yin became even more reluctant to work on this matter due to his passive attitude. Recently, the provincial authorities have telegraphed Huang Fu several times, and Huang replied that when he returns to Beijing in the near future, he will personally negotiate with the Japanese. Therefore, this matter has no choice but to quietly wait for Huang's return for negotiations. It was recently rumored in Pingfang that China and Japan will convene a meeting in Tianjin on various matters in the war zone, with Tao Shangming, Yin Rugeng, and Shibayama Iga as the central figures of the meeting. Inquiries with the authorities here revealed that there was no such thing. In fact, Shibayama's so-called "Kwantung Army's affair" is by no means a lie, because the number of Japanese troops stationed in the war zone and the number of our current security teams have a deep sense of proportion. If the newly編 special police team of 8,000 people goes there, with newer equipment and stricter discipline, it will not be possible for the currently stationed Japanese troops to monitor them. Therefore, the Japanese side regards this as a very important issue, which cannot be resolved in Tianjin by third- or fourth-rate figures. The authorities feel extremely棘手 about the matter of cracking down on Japanese and Korean ruffians in the war zone. They have repeatedly raised the issue with the Japanese side, saying that condoning the Japanese and Koreans to set up drug institutions everywhere, committing adultery and criminal offenses, and not allowing our local authorities to crack down on them, and blaming us for failing to protect them, is not in line with reason. When we raise this matter, the Japanese verbally express their apologies and say that they will investigate and send them back to their home countries one by one when they have time. However, in practice, no matter how we negotiate, not only is there no crackdown, but after each negotiation, several newly established drug institutions appear in the war zone. The more we hate and value it, the more the Japanese promote and spread it. It is more effective to take a calm attitude and ignore it than to negotiate and protest. ) 11th (</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission, arrived north yesterday (the 10th) from Shanghai aboard the Shengjing wheel. The municipal government received a telegram in advance and decided to disembark at Qianhai. Today (the 11th) at 1:30 p.m., the Shengjing wheel entered the port. Mayor Shen, Chairman Han, Committee Chairman Ge, and important figures from all walks of life went to the Qianhai pier to welcome him. The Public Security Bureau's military band was also ordered to go to meet him. The space between the piers was tightly guarded by the Public Security Bureau's first branch. Customs Superintendent Yuan Siyan and Finance Bureau Chief Guo Bingsu boarded the Customs Jiaoji patrol boat from Qianhai to welcome the Shengjing wheel. However, when the ship approached the Shengjing wheel, it was unable to dock due to the heavy wind and waves. After discussions between the two captains, it was decided to sail to a calmer area in the back sea to dock so that Song could disembark and board a small motorboat. Unexpectedly, when the Shengjing wheel and the Customs patrol boat circled around to the west side of Tuandao to dock, the welcoming crowd between the piers saw the two ships sailing towards the back sea, and at the same time, the Port Affairs Bureau's quarantine motorboat returned to the pier, saying that Song did not disembark at Qianhai. Mayor Shen and Chairman Han and others turned their cars to the Dagang Wharf to meet him. When the Shengjing wheel was about to approach the wharf, the military music played loudly, and Shen Han and others were waiting under the scorching sun. Who knew that after docking, it was discovered that Song had already disembarked at Qianhai. Shen Han and all the welcoming personnel returned disappointed. After Shen and Han returned to the club, Song and Guo Binghe and others went to the club to meet with Mayor Shen, Chairman Han, Committee Chairman Ge, and others, talking for a long time. Song then left the club and went to his private residence at No. 14 Fushan Road to rest. Qin Jingfu and five others came to Qingdao with Song. According to Song, his visit to Qingdao this time was purely to escape the heat, because Shanghai was unusually hot this year. He plans to stay in Qingdao for a few days. His family arrived in Qingdao earlier. The climate in Qingdao is cool and pleasant. Chairman Han came to Qingdao to meet with me because we have not met for many years and wanted to catch up. He will return to Shanghai when the weather cools down a bit. ) 11th (</p>

<p>Chengdu Airmail Sichuan Province's bandit suppression military affairs, after the capture of Tongjiang, have taken a sharp turn for the worse. Commander-in-Chief Liu Xiang made a statement the day before yesterday, announcing the bandit situation in Chengkou and Wanyuan. At the same time, he also published several telegrams from Yang Sen of the Fourth Route, Fan Shaozeng of the Fifth Route, and others to the headquarters reporting on the bandit situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e92">Xu and He Cannot Connect <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang made a statement the day before yesterday, saying, "The Fifth and Sixth Routes have been attacking Wanyuan since June 15th. The bandits concentrated their main force to fight back desperately. After more than ten days of fierce fighting, we have made no significant progress. The bandits abandoned important cities and fortresses such as Desheng Mountain, Zhenlong Pass, and Tongjiang and concentrated on the Wanyuan line. Their attempt is tentatively assumed to be: 1. Breaking through Xuanhan and Kaijiang and going straight to Yunwan, but the bandits' main force has been charging in this direction since before today, and the result has always been heavy losses. 2. Taking the intermediate route from Chengkou to Wuxi and Fengjie. Their occupation of Chengkou is very similar to this attempt, but according to reports, there are still only a few bandits in Chengkou, and I once passed through this road during the Qingxiang in the sixth year of the Republic. The view is desolate, the roads are rugged, and often after fifty or sixty li, no human smoke is seen. Even if the bandits are good at marching, even if they travel light and carry food, they cannot have a bandit team of more than a thousand people go straight to the dead end. 3. Outside, it is estimated that the bandits in northern Sichuan will actively flee south and join forces with He's bandits. In fact, the nature of Xu's bandits and He's bandits is very different. Xu's bandits are true communists. He's bandits have very little strength and have become vagrant bandits who only bind and plunder wealthy families everywhere, which is no different from ordinary bandits. If Xu and He intend to join forces, He must gather in the valleys between Shizhu and Lichuan to wait for Xu to flee south. However, He has now deeply fled into the territory of Guizhou, which shows that he does not want to join forces with Xu. 4. Since Xu's bandits' attempt to flee south cannot be realized, those who desperately counterattacked our Fifth Route Army in the Wanyuan area the day before yesterday should be advancing as a retreat, using the momentum of the attack to cover the retreat of the remaining bandits in Tongnan. The most realistic attempt at present is probably still to retreat to the Daba Mountains and take the opportunity to peep at southern Shaanxi."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Bandits Attempt to Hold Firm in One Corner <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Yang Sen of the Fourth Route went to Tongcheng to inspect the results. On the 2nd, he telegraphed the headquarters to report on the inspection situation, saying, "The natives in the Tongjiang area not only have not been red-influenced but also hate the bandits especially deeply. Yong Shoukang, the head of the regiment of my department, was captured, escaped from Tongjiang, and hid near Tongcheng. The natives treated him extremely well and tried every means to protect him and get him out of danger. Their hatred of the bandits and affection for us can be seen from this. Even when we arrived, the natives expressed extreme friendliness. According to them, the bandits' retreat from Tongjiang was decided as early as March of this year. Therefore, at that time, they began to move the machinery of various factories to Wangping, the rear of Dehan City, and robbed pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, stone mills, farm tools, tables, and benches. Even the door bolts were moved and cleaned, and all the houses were burned down. Tongcheng has several salt wells, but the salt production is extremely small. Eighty taels of salt require three thousand firewood wells. After many investigations by my department, the bandits seem to have no intention of disturbing Lower East and western Hubei. The reason why they gathered so many livestock and farm tools is probably to use their 200,000 people to hold firm in one corner, recuperate, and cultivate strength, waiting for the country to have more troubles before coming out to harass again."</p>

<p>Fan Shaozeng, Deputy Commander of the Fifth Route Army, telegraphed the province on the 5th, saying, "According to reliable reports, the bandits facing Zeng's department are as follows: The independent division, pioneers, new theater troupe, transportation team, etc. of the puppet Fourth Army are stationed in Wajuanpu. The military headquarters of the puppet Fourth Army and the 265th and 266th regiments of the puppet Eighth and Ninth Divisions, and about three regiments of other miscellaneous troops, are stationed in the area of Yaopu Ridge and Jigongding. The wireless radio station and attached special company and independent company are stationed in Jiuzipo. The hospital is stationed in Hongshan Hall. The 267th regiment is stationed in Wu Shao Bei. The military headquarters and special company regiment of the puppet Thirtieth Army are stationed in Chang Ge Lang. The division headquarters and special company battalion of the puppet Eighty-eighth Division are stationed in Majiaping. A part of the 27th division and the 264th regiment are stationed in Mabaozhai. Two regiments of the puppet Ninetieth Division are stationed in the area of Mashichang and Huangshan. The 78th regiment of the puppet army is stationed in Kang Jialiang. The 33rd regiment of the puppet army is stationed in Zhibaozhen. The 263rd regiment of the puppet army is stationed in Yaoshipo." (Guowen News Agency, July 6)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence Previously, Guizhou Province was invaded by two routes of communist bandits from the Sichuan border. Wang Jialie sent teams to block them separately. Chen Quzhen's Xiang army division also arrived in western Hunan to attack from both sides. Fu's Guizhou army brigade attacked from Wuchuan, and Tian's Sichuan army brigade attacked from the rear. The Sichuan bandits were attacked from the front and rear. Fu's Guizhou army brigade soon recovered Houping in Wuchuan. The bandits in western Hubei also had a tendency to disturb Songtong and connect with the Sichuan bandits. After the Guizhou army cut off their communication line, they also did not dare to cross the border. On the Chishui road, after Jiang Bixu's troops attacked, they had already collapsed step by step. Liu's brigade of Jiang's division had advanced and stationed in Chishui and set up a pacification office to handle the aftermath. Since the communist bandits in Guizhou Province had been suppressed, Wang Jialie, in order to unite the military leaders and seek peaceful construction and design, initiated a joint military and political meeting in Guiyang, hoping to eliminate old grievances and cooperate peacefully with the Guizhou military leaders You Guocai, Shou Guangxiang, and Che Mingyi. Through the mediation of Mai Huanzhang and Miao Ruoxu, representatives of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, Mao You and others seemed to have complied. Therefore, You telegraphed last month to take the post of bandit suppression commander appointed by Wang (Jialie), and Mao also intended to take the post of member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council. Wang then set the date for the joint military and political meeting to be held on the first of this month. Afterwards, the date of the meeting was suddenly postponed, so it has not been held until now. The outside world has speculated that the situation in Guizhou is still divided and has not been unified. Moreover, Mao and You's failure to attend the joint military and political meeting has more or less confronted Wang. After this statement came out, Zhang Yunliang, the Guizhou Wang representative stationed in Guangdong, strongly refuted the inaccuracy of the change in the Guizhou situation. According to the talks, Che Mingji's department had already been eliminated, and the remaining hundreds of Jiang Zaizhen's department had also been 編遣 by Wang Jialie long ago, so there was no possibility of change. You Guocai has already taken the post of bandit suppression commander, and there is no reason to unite with Jiang Che and others. It seems that the cooperation between Wang (Jialie) and You (Guocai) will not change. You's failure to attend the meeting this time was because he was busy with bandit affairs and could not arrive in Guiyang as scheduled. Wang is now setting another date to convene the meeting. Also, Wang Jialie recently appointed Xie Rulin as the chief of staff of the army, 王部二十五軍 (Wang's 25th Army). After Xie was appointed, he took office on the first of this month. Yesterday, Xie telegraphed Guizhou and reported to Zhang Yunliang, Director Wang Jiezhi, the representative stationed in Guangdong, that Guizhou Province is now thoroughly seeking peaceful cooperation and will soon have some performance in fact. The original telegram said, "I have arrived at the headquarters for work today. The thorough peaceful cooperation in the province can be gradually settled and will soon have a performance in fact. I will reach it. Rulin bowed, Dongyin, Zhang Wang, and others replied to Xie on the 5th by telegraph, encouraging him to work hard to assist in the promotion of peace." ) 8th (</p>

<h3 id="e96">(The Attitudes of Britain and America Towards the Naval Disarmament Conference) American Correspondence (America Does Not Abandon its Original Position; Britain Must Maintain Maritime Hegemony) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory meeting for the Naval Disarmament Conference has already begun in London. This meeting naturally has its own unique characteristics. Whether the formal conference next year can succeed depends on this preparatory meeting. It is an important key to future peace in the Pacific. The main countries participating in this meeting—the United States, Britain, and Japan—each have different opinions, and their goals are different. For example, the United States wants to maintain transportation across the two oceans, insists on the doctrine of large ships and big guns, and advocates extending the London Naval Treaty. Britain wants to ensure the security of its maritime colonies around the world, and its navy must be superior to other countries, so it wants to expand its military strength. Japan's dominance in the Far East has become a trend, and it wants to compete with Britain and the United States, so it strongly advocates equality in armaments. These opinions are not merely technical issues; they are the reefs of the preparatory meeting and a huge cancer in the current international situation. We also know that the United States, among the countries in the world today, is relatively unwilling to compete militarily. It also has no immediate plans to use force in the Pacific. However, it has its own special views on the navy and is also making preparations.</p>
<p>Because the current President Franklin Roosevelt served as Undersecretary of the Navy before World War I and after the Washington Conference, he has some goodwill towards Japan, but in reality, he did his best to prepare the navy during his tenure, especially in the military preparation in the Pacific. The construction of fortresses in the Philippines and Guam was due to the excessive cost of engineering facilities in those two places and the long time required, and also because Manila is far from the U.S. naval base (the sea voyage is about 8,000 miles). In any case, the current strength of the United States is difficult to reliably ensure the safety of Manila, so it strives to operate its vanguard base in Pearl Harbor (a seaport belonging to Hawaii) as a fulcrum for the Far East. Recently, there have also been proposals to operate the Aleutian Islands as airfields. This undoubtedly shows that it is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt has a deep relationship with the naval community. Although he does not directly oppose Japan, he is not willing to give in easily. As for the current Secretary of the Navy, Swanson, he is an out-and-out advocate of a strong navy. He is confident that he has the mission of building an invincible U.S. navy in the world, so he has an amazing plan for a large navy. In front of the American people, he shouted that the U.S. Navy has become decayed and cannot be used. He advised the American people to immediately recognize and implement his naval plan, saying, "Our aggressive neighbor to the west is eyeing the Philippines covetously..."</p>
<p>"The future of the great republic lies at sea." The American people already have a considerable understanding of this, and they feel that the international status of the United States would be very dangerous without a strong navy, so he also advocated that "the 5:5:3 ratio is absolutely fair and appropriate and should be permanently continued." There are also authoritative officers in naval warfare, such as Admiral Pratt, who expressed his views on international naval relations, opposing Japan's claim to naval equality. He believes that Japan does not need a navy like Britain to guard the world's oceans. Japan is not like the United States, which is located between the Atlantic, Pacific, and South Seas. Once a war breaks out, Japan's neutral status and its responsibilities are not as great as those of Britain and the United States. Even if there is a war, other countries cannot impose military or economic blockades on Japan. Furthermore, increasing the ratio would be difficult to bear, considering Japan's national treasury revenue. Such arguments are enough to strengthen the U.S. authorities' opinions on naval disarmament and more clearly tend to extend the past naval treaties and maintain the old ratio, causing future disputes.</p>
<p>Such is the atmosphere in North America. Looking out across the Atlantic, what will Britain, which has long occupied the maritime throne, do? Britain's navy cannot be represented by the Naval Ministry, let alone the current Secretary of the Navy, Monsell, who is a retired naval commander. However, Monsell served as Undersecretary of the Navy when the construction of the Singapore naval base was being fiercely debated in the House of Commons, and he made various effective activities. He said, "The mission of the British Navy is not only to protect the British coast but also to maintain the safety of our country's overseas trade. In other words, it is to protect maritime transportation routes. After the Washington Conference, the defense of Hong Kong was agreed to be maintained as it is, while the construction of the Singapore port is absolutely necessary to defend navigation." This shows Britain's true intentions. This kind of thinking has not changed to this day. To make it the world's number one naval power, Britain's tone of expanding its navy, even if it has not been sung as high as the United States, but the actual preparation work has not been relaxed in the slightest.

<h3 id="e97">The Vanguard of the Southern Route Army Approaches Yudu丨Ye Jianying's Troops Suffer Heavy Losses in Zhandang丨Guangzhou Correspondence <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since the representatives of the four route armies settled the bandit suppression plan in Guangdong, they immediately started to implement it. According to front-line news, the leading troops have now advanced to the Maling River Estuary area, about a hundred miles from Yudu. The bandits retreated to Yangya, forty miles from Hanfang, and were surrounded by government troops. More than thirty bandits were killed, and the rest fled to the nearby mountains. Due to the pressure on Yudu, the bandit leader Ye Jianying recently gathered the remnants and joined with about five or six thousand bandits from Tingzhou to return to Huichang. On the 2nd of this month, the communist bandits' pseudo-22nd Division fell into Zhandang. Together with the pseudo-31st Division, they attacked Zhoutian in separate routes. Huang Yanzhen's troops of the 7th Division stationed on the Yunmen front line, including Huang Shitu and Ouyang Xin's regiments, immediately divided their forces to meet the enemy and fought fiercely with the bandits in Zhoutian. By 4 p.m. on the 2nd, the communist bandits were severely defeated. The remnants fled back to Zhandang towards Huichang. The headquarters of the Second Column yesterday telegraphed a report on the battle situation, stating that "According to Huang Division Commander Yan Zhen's telegram on the 2nd, about 3,000 bandits from Zhandang Yangmei Pai attacked Zhoutian in three routes at Chou hour today. Ouyang Xin's regiment stationed in Banjiang, upon receiving the report, immediately led the team to directly attack the middle route of the enemy. In the beginning, they won victories and made gains, so they divided into three routes to pursue. After receiving the report, I immediately dispatched Huang Regiment Zhu Battalion, leading three companies, to Ban Gang to respond. As soon as our Zhu Battalion arrived at Ban Gang, they heard that Ouyang Xin's troops were fighting fiercely with the bandits near Zhoutian, so they led the team to support. At 4 p.m., they finally defeated all the bandits and fled towards Zhandang. (2) According to the captured bandits, the bandits who attacked today were the pseudo-22nd Division, the 31st Division, the Guard Brigade, and the 2nd Regiment of the Independent Battalion, etc., about 3,000 guns. Most of the bandits retreated from Tingzhou to Huichang and opened to Zhandang. Mao Zedong went to Zhandang to give a speech once. According to the captured pseudo-stretch bearers, they were recruited from north of Huichang to serve a few days ago. Yesterday, they came to Zhoutian from Huichang via Mazhou Zhandang. There were six or seven thousand bandits. It is said that they came from Ruijin. (3) More than twenty bandits were captured today. They are now under strict interrogation. It is said that the people's group seized many guns. According to Jiang's telegram on the 3rd, Peng Duojun and Peng Tonghe, squad leaders of the 4th Company of the 66th Regiment of the Pseudo 22nd Division, led thirteen bandits, carrying eight good guns and four homemade guns, to surrender to our department. According to the confession, Jian (28th) was on sentry duty in Zhongcun. They agreed with thirteen bandits of this company to take the opportunity to escape. On the 29th, they arrived at Ouyang Jiang's department and asked to be brought to surrender. Currently, the 4th and 6th companies of the 2nd Battalion of the Pseudo 66th Regiment and local guerrillas of about 300 people are stationed in Zhongcun. The bandit army is extremely short of bullets, with only a few bullets per gun. In addition to giving rewards to the fifteen bandits and arranging them properly, I respectfully present this report."

<h3 id="e98">The Ping City Council Responds to the Municipal Government's Budget Estimate <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Ping News, The Ping City Council recently responded to the municipal government regarding the local budget estimate for the 23rd year, saying, "1. We have received the notification from your government regarding the review and revision of the budget estimate for the 23rd year, requesting reconsideration, etc. It was submitted for discussion at the 24th regular meeting of the second phase on the 4th of this month. It was generally believed that although the income and expenditure of the budget for the 23rd year are still suitable, the expenses for salaries and consumption are high, and the expenses for construction projects are low. The salary item listed by the municipal government is more than 9,600 yuan higher than that of the 22nd year, and the consumption is more than 6,300 yuan higher, without explanation, which is inconsistent with the mayor's usual declaration of "one person's meal for two people, two people's work for one person." Furthermore, the staff of various agencies have not been appointed according to law, and their salaries have not been paid according to law. The mayor alone receives a special office fee of up to 1,000 yuan per month in addition to his salary. The celebration fee is 3,600 yuan per year. During the national crisis, the central government has repeatedly ordered to simplify it, so there is no need to continue the previous extravagance. Moreover, it is only a celebration of the official office, and various legal entities have not been invited, so there is no need for such a large expense. The entertainment fee is 4,800 yuan per year. Although Beijing has diplomatic relations, there are the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Beijing and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Custody Office stationed in Beijing. The municipal government only represents this city and does not need such a large expense. In May of this year, during the heavy national humiliation commemoration, a garden party was held at a cost of several thousand yuan, and Yenching University girls were appointed to practice hospitality, which has already been greatly regretted by the people. All of the above points should be reduced. This council understands that the initial budget estimate was proposed, and many things have been followed, so it will be lenient and not delve into it, in order to gradually get on track. Unexpectedly, it is still not enough to meet the mayor's wishes, which is difficult for the city council. The reasons for the review are that the supervision of autonomy is the original right of the mayor. The autonomous elections of the districts and neighborhoods of this city have already been completed. The mayor supervises according to law and allocates the existing staff of the municipal government according to their capabilities, which can be sufficient. There is no need to set up additional sections and shares, and there is no need for such a huge amount of more than 30,000 yuan per year. Moreover, since autonomy is set as the beginning period, preparing for the completion of autonomy is the responsibility of the city council, and there is no need to set up an autonomous supervision office. The vehicle donation is a major source of revenue for this city. The revised regulations on vehicle donation in this city do not have any provisions for exemption. It is heard that the vehicles of Chairman Huang of the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Beijing have all been donated, and the same is true for others. There are records for business operations, and taxes and donations have never been heard of. The mayor has always claimed to be unafraid of boundaries and resistance, and his resistance to donating may be an excuse to avoid it. It concerns annual income and he must be able to find a way to collect it, so that there is no loss. As for bicycles, they are the most popular product, with a trend of traveling thousands of miles a day. There are registration of more than 75,000 vehicles with names and addresses that can be checked. According to the regulations, each vehicle should donate two yuan per year, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. How can we allow omissions and not donate? Even if there are losses from resale, the number must not be large. Instead of being harsh and bitter to the small people, it is more fair to collect donations according to law. If we abandon this plan, and lightly defend this huge amount of omissions, the members who collect it will inevitably be derelict in their duties. This council believes that the revenue from vehicle donations is more than this number. Although there has been an increase in education and roads in the business sector, the funds for health are still not evenly developed. Moreover, the roads in the suburbs are related to transportation, rural education, and the people's livelihood. The equipment for science experiments in middle schools is incomplete, resulting in the worst graduation performance. The river channels and ditches are not repaired, which is detrimental to hygiene and cleanliness, so they are added in amount. In short, deciding on budgets and final accounts is the special right of the people's representatives and the important responsibility that the people's representatives should bear for the people. They have the right to review and the right to amend. Although the political systems of various countries are different, and the measures are different, the budgets submitted to the parliament are always amended before they are passed. The budget estimate for this city in the 23rd year should have been submitted earlier, but it was delayed and not sent. It was repeatedly urged and sent on April 28th of this year, close to the central review period. It is heard that the municipal government sent the previous budget to the council and also sent it to the central government, hoping to be approved directly. The councilors were deeply horrified. The review of the second-level budget by this council has been approved by the Executive Yuan according to law and ordered to be complied with. It has been reviewed and sent to the central government first, which is a violation of laws and regulations. If it is not necessary to be decided by this council and can be approved, then the right of decision of the city council stipulated by laws and regulations is a mere formality. The responsibility for such out-of-bounds behavior should be borne by the mayor. As for the budget notification of this council for the 23rd year, the municipal government did not consult with it and immediately reduced it. The expenses of this council were originally provisional, and the budget changes from year to year. The salaries and consumption of the municipal government can be increased without reason, while this council has too little funds, and there are various omissions in travel expenses, entertainment printing, stoves, etc., and the facts are difficult. The amount has been increased and has been reported to the Executive Yuan. Moreover, during this review, the speaker and deputy speaker repeatedly consulted with the mayor, who agreed to do so. The notification turned the previous discussion upside down, which also hinders credibility. The budget for the 23rd year has now entered the beginning period. Since it has been revised and passed, it is not convenient to change it again. The members of the council unanimously voted to specially inspect the original documents and respond to the investigation. This notification is for the Beijing Municipal Government."</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Confirmation, The National Army's 53rd Division Zhou Brigade, at dawn on the 3rd of this month, passed through Anfu Yongxin Jian's Xia Mu Pengpu and detoured to the left side of Songshan Xiao Bandit's rear. At the same time, Li Brigade of the Division attacked the bandits in Songshan from the area of Malan Bridge Left Fang. At 5 a.m. of that day, Zhou Brigade arrived in the area north of Dagan. At 6 a.m., Li Brigade launched a fierce attack on the bandits in Songshan. The bandits resisted stubbornly and the battle was fierce. Finally, our officers and soldiers fought bravely, and the bandits were unable to support themselves and collapsed towards Lianhuaping and Dashi. At 7 a.m., the National Army completely occupied the Songshan position. In this battle, dozens of bandits were captured, more than fifty guns were seized, and the bandits were killed and wounded heavily. More than 300 bodies were left on the battlefield. It is also reported that after the National Army burned the bandit nest on Shangle Mountain in Dayu a few days ago, Jiang Wuyu Regiment stationed in Xinfeng defeated 500 remnants of Xiao Ke's bandits in Xinanbao, killing more than 100 bandits and seizing more than 50 guns. At the same time, Wang Shi in Anyuan repelled the bandits who attacked Qingxi. Zeng Da's regiment defeated the communist bandit men and women in plain clothes in Guikengtang Village, killing more than ten male bandits and capturing the female bandit chief of staff Lin Huizhen and the female plain clothes team leader Luo Zhiqun. Currently, the defense works in Pangu Pass and Chengjiang Market in the south of Yunmenling have been completed. The highways of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi have been completed and opened to traffic at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Longgang Market has long been reduced to an important bandit lair in the west of southern Jiangxi. People are displaced and the ground is covered with thorns. Since the National Army recovered it last month, the 6th Route Army is now stationed there. The southern Jiangxi area has also been recovered section by section, and highways are being built to the south. This month, traffic will be opened in Jiangnei, which can directly reach Tie Luoxia. Military transportation is very convenient. Currently, the army is assisting the people in building houses and cultivating fields, and a large-scale reception center has been established to accommodate more than 300 old, weak, and disabled people. Many nearby people have come to return, and they have been engaged in organization and training, handling it very seriously. The bandit department heard the news and those who carried weapons to surrender are constantly emerging. Zhang Zhixiang, the chief of the pseudo-supply department, also came to surrender one day. The army specially reported by telegram yesterday, (July 9)</p>

<p>Quzhou Correspondence Zhejiang Province faces the sea to the east, with numerous islands and a coastline of more than 1,300 li. The rivers include the Qiantang River in the north, the Jiao River and Ou River in the middle, and the Feiyun River and Ao River in the south. Other lakes, marshes, rivers, and streams are also scattered like stars. The vastness of the fishing grounds and the richness of the water resources are the best in the southeast. The value of the annual fishery products along the coast and rivers in Zhejiang Province is estimated to be about 8 million yuan for Ningbo, about 600,000 yuan for Zhapu, about 3 million yuan for Shipu, about 3 million yuan for Shaoxing, about 2 million yuan for Zhenhai, and about 10 million yuan for Wenzhou and Taizhou combined. Together with Jiangsu Province, it is more than 60 million yuan per year. The reproduction of fish is no less than that of Japan, but in recent years, the domestic demand is not enough, and it still needs to be supplied by Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. The total value of aquatic products imported from foreign countries each year averages more than 30 million yuan. Zhejiang Province's fish production has suffered from Japanese cross-border fishing and low-price dumping to us, and the business is declining day by day and life is becoming increasingly difficult. The Construction Department is aware of this, and believes that if the fisheries in the province are declining and no urgent measures are taken to provide relief, not only will the development of fisheries be hopeless, but hundreds of thousands of fishermen in Zhejiang Province will be bankrupt. It has decided to immediately find ways to provide relief, starting with protecting fisheries and regulating the fishermen's economy, and has formulated six measures to develop fisheries as follows: (1) Instruct the offshore water police to effectively maintain the security of the fishing grounds. Each coastal county, or a combination of several counties, may also set up ocean-going ships equipped with weapons for patrol and guard during the fishing season. (2) Issue fishery public bonds or raise funds to establish a fishery bank and loan office in the fishing area, and at the same time urge fishermen to organize marketing and other various cooperatives. (3) Establish a training institute for fishery guidance personnel. After graduation, they will be assigned to fishing areas to teach fishermen the necessary knowledge and skills in fisheries. At the same time, establish fishery guidance offices in important fishing areas to solve the fishermen's difficulties at any time. (4) Promote new organizations in fisheries, purchase new fishing vessels and fishing gear, and plan to establish fishing gear manufacturing plants and scientific manufacturing plants for aquatic products. (5) Set up refrigerated transport ships and weather observation stations. (6) Establish large-scale fish and shellfish breeding grounds along the coast and in areas with large lakes and marshes, and set up breeding farms. (5th)</p>

<p>A woman named Lu, who lives across from the orphanage outside the west gate of this city, gave birth today (13th) to a female monster. Its limbs were like birds, its nose had only one hole, thin and long, its ears were extremely small and curled, and its eyes were extremely narrow, like pig eyes, and closed. It died immediately after birth. The family members all considered it ominous, and the onlookers were very crowded.</p>

<p>This county has been suffering from a prolonged drought without rain, and a disaster is in the making. As of the 11th, the reported drought areas are the first, fourth, and sixth districts. Locusts have been found in the Jiangyan area of the fourth district, Huangjing Luwu. They are currently being exterminated. The people in various districts, accustomed to customs, have been praying devoutly, abstaining from slaughtering animals to pray for rain. Most of the participants are officials, gentry, merchants, and farmers, chanting scriptures and praying for an early downpour. Various steamships have been experiencing difficulties with the river channels and are unable to sail easily. They have discussed solutions and agreed that the Yu Da will specialize in sailing to Taikun, and the Guangli will specialize in sailing to Taifu. The tugboats will be supported at the fiber port from Beixiang to Xixiang, but the time around the city will take about an hour. If the water level drops another three or five inches, the steamships will be unable to sail. Wang Tongsi, a farmer in Yangliyan Bridge, fourth district, was extremely anxious because his rice seedlings were withered. He asked people to scoop water to irrigate his fields, which cost one yuan and five cents per mu each time, and he wanted to make a prior agreement. Wang was a poor man, and when he saw this situation, he was worried and committed suicide by hanging himself. By the time his family discovered it, it was too late to save him. It was also very tragic. Rice prices have reached eleven yuan and several cents due to the lack of supply due to the small amount of water, and unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and speculating. The river water in the city is ink green, and the well water is turbid and unfit for drinking. People from all walks of life are worried.</p>

<p>Wang Rulin from Qidong Zhenyang City, who is in his twenties, was introduced by a friend this spring to work in the survey team of the Nanchang Branch of the National Economic Committee of Jiangxi, with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. Wang resigned because the salary was meager. He returned to his hometown on the Jiangjing ship of the China Merchants Bureau the day before yesterday. When the ship sailed to the Jiangmian of Nantong Yaogang, Wang suddenly drowned himself in the river. The ship stopped and rescued him without success. The tea worker checked his luggage, which included two cotton quilts, two leather boxes, and clothes such as summer cloth and a letter in the box. This letter was entrusted by Sun Yangfeng, a staff member of the highway office, to Wu Luofen, the first section chief of the Haimen County Government. The property is now preserved by the shipowner, and a report has been sent to the Qidong County Government to notify the relatives of the deceased to collect it.</p>

<p>In recent days, many refugees have passed through the territory, arbitrarily demanding and doing whatever they want in the countryside. Yesterday (10th) afternoon, more than 200 refugees from Hunan came to Hai from Nantong. When they arrived at the residence of Yuan Fengdan, a wealthy household in Batou Town, District 1, they entered and forcibly demanded silver dollars, rice, and wheat. At that time, Yuan's residence happened to be employing five or six workers to dig a trench in the house. Seeing the surging momentum, they came out to stop them, and a mutual fight broke out. However, they were outnumbered, and the victim Yuan Fengdan and other workers were seriously injured. The First Squadron of the Security Team and the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau were reported and dispatched police to suppress the riot. More than ten refugees who were the leaders of the riot were detained and sent to the county government for interrogation. The remaining refugees were escorted to the Zhongshan Hall in the county seat and city for temporary accommodation. Today (12th) morning, the injured victims and workers were taken to the county for examination and requested that the murderers be severely punished.</p>

<p>It has been reported that more than 500 villagers in Hengjing Township, a county in Suzhou, surrounded the township office the day before yesterday due to the issue of reporting famine and surveying disasters. Now it is learned that in Luxiang Village in the township, a farmer rented a water pump from the electric factory to irrigate his fields. The villagers mistakenly thought it was borrowed from the township office, and a conflict occurred, injuring several villagers. Soon, five or six hundred villagers flocked to the township office to borrow a water pump to save the morning fields, saying that if they did not agree, they would destroy the entire township office. Because of the large number of people and poor order, many instruments in the township office were destroyed by the villagers. Later, after District Chief Kong's vigorous explanation, they left reluctantly. District Chief Kong telegraphed the above situation to the county government yesterday, requesting instructions on how to handle it.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Panic Over Drinking Water in Suzhou <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to the records of the Taihu Water Conservancy Association Meteorological Station, the temperature in Suzhou on the 12th was 105.1 degrees, breaking the record of the past 60 years. It was also 104 degrees on the 13th. The rivers and wells in the urban area are dry. The price of river water is two cents per load and must be booked in advance. The citizens are in extreme panic over drinking water. The Construction Bureau has now decided to first dig four large-diameter artesian wells in the city, dedicated to providing drinking water for citizens. Existing private artesian wells are also ordered to be opened to the public, and each household is limited to two loads of water. Shi Yunqing, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Shoupeng, representative of the Fire Brigade, and others accompanied Zhou Jun, director of the Construction Bureau, to Xumen on the 13th to inspect the location for opening the sluice gate and decided that the Construction Bureau would immediately submit a request to the provincial government to allocate funds and start construction within this week to divert the Xumen River water into the city. At the same time, the mayor of Qixi Town submitted a request to the province to open the Yangcheng Dam to divert the Yangcheng water into the city.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Actively Planning for Drought Relief <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Since the 28th of last month, the weather has been hot and humid, with no rain, and signs of disaster have emerged, causing rice prices to soar. White rice is now ten yuan and eight jiao per dan. In the past two days, the heat has increased further, reaching 102 degrees indoors and 110 degrees outdoors. At 4:00 PM on the 12th, dark clouds gathered, and a thunderstorm occurred, lasting only about a quarter of an hour. Only half an inch of rain fell, and the farmland in the surrounding countryside has no water for irrigation. The drinking water supply has been cut off, causing great panic among the residents. The river channels in the urban area are so dry that the bottom can be seen, causing difficulties for transportation, drinking water, and fire fighting. The latrines in various places are full of waste because the boats transporting manure from the countryside cannot come to the city, causing the waste to flow into the streets, which has a significant impact on sanitation. The supply of firewood and straw has also been cut off. In view of this, the local New Life Movement Promotion Association plans to find ways to remedy the situation. A meeting was specifically convened yesterday, and the following resolutions were made: 1. Build dams at all the water gates of the four city gates, and use electricity at the West Water Gate to pump water from the Liangxi River into the city. 2. The association will submit the plan to the First District Office for implementation within three days. 3. The project requires 800 yuan. The association will first donate 50 yuan to show its support. The remaining amount will be allocated to the District Office and the town offices in the city. 4. For electricity, please contact the Qishuyan Power Plant to offer the lowest price and fulfill its obligations. District Chief Qian will go to make contact. 5.</p>
<p>The First District Office convened an emergency meeting of the town leaders in the city to discuss the implementation methods. As for Director of the Construction Bureau Zhang Fulin, in order to plan the dredging of important waterways to the Yangtze River, he specially accompanied Technical Section Chief Huang Dechun to Cheng to consult with Cheng County Magistrate Bao on opening the Huangtiangang Sluice to introduce the Yangtze River water into the inland river to facilitate traffic between Wuxi and Cheng. Regarding the issue of opening the Dongba Dam requested by the officials and people of Wujin, neighboring counties unanimously opposed it. Yesterday, the Wuxi and Yixing public legal groups jointly submitted a petition to the provincial authorities, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of the Dongba Dam and requesting a stern rejection. At the same time, the entrances to the Yangtze River and the major inland rivers in Wujin, Jiangyin, Changshu, and other places should be promptly inspected, and dredging should be selectively carried out to facilitate water flow and irrigate farmland. At the same time, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce also sent letters to the relevant counties regarding the Dongba Dam issue, requesting unanimous support. The Wujin County Magistrate Cai Pei, together with Gao Zhenbai, the Party Committee member of the county, went to the provincial government to seek instructions and have already returned to Changzhou. The provincial government also advocates caution and has decided not to open the Dongba Dam and to seek other ways to connect to the Yangtze River for drought relief. In addition, Sha Yankai, a famous lawyer from Yixing, also sent a letter to Qian Sunqing in this city, detailing the history of the Dongba Dam and stating that there is no reason to open it.</p>

<p>The buildings of the county government in this city were rented from the Zeng family at a monthly rent of 120 yuan. Because they were dilapidated, a budget was approved to build a new county government on Dongmen Street. The houses were contracted by Gong Fengji's construction workshop and have been under construction for five months. The buildings have now been completed, and the county has submitted a request to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to send personnel for acceptance inspection. As for the gate tower, a new drawing has been added, and construction has begun.</p>

<p>Wujin County is experiencing a drought with no rain, and signs of disaster have emerged. The county government has specifically established a disaster prevention committee to plan relief measures. After discussion, it was decided to request the provincial government to approve the opening of the Dongba Dam to relieve the immediate crisis. County Magistrate Cai Ziping and Gao Bozhen, the representative of the County Party Department, went to the provincial government on the 11th to petition. They have now returned to Changzhou. According to County Magistrate Cai, after Yixing County requested the opening of the Dongba Dam, the provincial government sent personnel to inspect the Dongba Dam. As a result, the water level of the Dongba Dam was one foot lower than in previous years. If the dam is opened widely, the floodwaters will inundate the area, causing great danger. It will cost two to three million to rebuild the dam in the future. Where will such a large amount of money come from? If the dam is opened slightly, only Liyang County will benefit, and other counties will not receive any benefit. Therefore, it is advisable not to open the Dongba Dam. Subsequently, County Magistrate Cai offered the following suggestions since the Dongba Dam could not be opened: 1. Pump the water from the rivers and lakes into the inland rivers. 2. Pump the water from the inland rivers into the tributaries. 3. Pump the water from the tributaries to irrigate farmland. This plan was adopted by the provincial government.</p>

<p>Zheng Yitong, the commissioner of the Nantong District, telegraphed the provincial government to report on the drought in the counties of Tong, Rugao, Chongming, Hai'an, Qidong, and Jingjiang in the district, stating that since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rainfall and the weather has been severely dry. The ditches and canals have dried up, and the land has cracked. All agricultural crops, cotton, wood, and miscellaneous grains lack water for nourishment and have mostly withered. Moreover, a small number of fields were planted a little later and have not yet emerged from the soil. Currently, farmers in the fields are trying to lift and irrigate day and night, doing their best to save the crops. However, the drought has been prolonged, and the water is running out, making irrigation impossible. In view of the current situation, signs of disaster have appeared. Therefore, it is specially reported for investigation and so on. The situation in Nantong, Rugao, and Chongming counties is also the same. The commissioner personally went to the countryside to investigate and confirmed that the report was true. The drought has become a disaster. If heavy rain does not fall within a few days, there is little hope for the autumn harvest.</p>

<p>The territory of Hai'an County, Nantong, is suffering from a severe drought and extreme heat. Currently, locusts have appeared in the area around the Toujia Town at the boundary of the two counties and are spreading rapidly. On the 10th, Zheng, the commissioner of the Nantong District, ordered the county magistrates of Tong and Hai'an, Jin and Zhang, to quickly take measures to eliminate them.</p>

<p>The fourth squad of the second company of the Jiangdu County Security Team was stationed in Huaiziqiao Town. Squad Leader Xia Wenxiang suddenly heard loud voices and gongs sounding from the direction of Wenzhuang, about a mile from the town, at around 10:00 PM on the 11th, which seemed to indicate a bandit attack. He immediately led the team to rush to rescue. However, as soon as they left the town by 100 meters, a bullet came flying towards them and hit Zhang Kaicheng, a first-class soldier, in the head. He fell to the ground and died instantly. They immediately returned fire and engaged in a fierce battle. After about a few minutes, they realized that the people who fired and killed Zhang Kaicheng were the villagers of Wenzhuang, Tang Zhengyi and Yu Changhu, and others. Because the villagers heard the sound of gongs and voices on the bridge, followed by gunfire, they also suspected it was a bandit robbery and rushed to rescue. In the darkness, they mistakenly identified the police team as bandits and opened fire straight at them. The squad leader has already come to the city overnight to report to the county security team headquarters, which dispatched Deputy Squad Leader Zhao Qingshi to rush to investigate on the morning of the 12th. Tang Zhengyi and others also admitted to opening fire without denying it. It was also found that the origin of the voices and gongs was that Chen Sanlai, a fisherman, was holding a ceremony with shamans to pray for blessings because his daughter-in-law had died and his wife was ill. Many people watched, causing the police team to mistakenly believe it was a bandit robbery. Wenzhuang also heard the sound of voices and gongs, followed by gunfire, resulting in one mistake leading to another and causing a fatality.</p>

<p>Zhang Acai, a farmer from Zhongbuqiao in Hang County, who was nearly thirty years old, was usually diligent and thrifty, law-abiding and content. Recently, due to the sharp drop in silk prices and the low value of grain hurting farmers, the income from his hard work was not enough to cover the costs. His mother, daughter, wife, and children had no means of support, leading to a growing mountain of debt and accumulated arrears. Although he went out to make arrangements everywhere, he could not find a solution. He then conceived the idea of committing suicide to escape from the sea of suffering. He hanged himself on a beam yesterday. By the time it was discovered, he had already died.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the sun has been scorching and the weather has been intensely hot for days, and agricultural products are withering due to the impact of the severe drought. Various sectors are actively seeking ways to remedy the situation. Various charitable organizations began setting up altars to pray for rain yesterday. The city government has specifically allocated funds to purchase water lifting machines, and the Municipal Farmers' Association will also assist the government in drought relief efforts. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Municipal Affairs Meeting <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau received a petition from the farmers' associations in various districts, stating that there had been no rain for a long time and that a drought was about to occur. It was requested that water lifting machines be purchased as soon as possible to relieve the agricultural production. The bureau drafted a plan and submitted it to the city government, requesting an allocation of 5,000 yuan to purchase water lifting machines. The city government held a municipal affairs meeting yesterday, attended by all bureau chiefs, chaired by Mayor Wu. In addition to discussing other cases, the purchase of water lifting machines to relieve agricultural production was passed and handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for management.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Mayor's Remarks <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the drought prevention issue in this city. He kindly made the following remarks: Since the beginning of summer, there has been little rainfall and the weather has been hot, which has not been seen in decades. The rivers and lakes are gradually drying up. In the areas near the rivers, there is still water that can be lifted, while the areas farther away from the rivers are showing signs of drought. If we do not urgently seek relief, there is no hope for the autumn harvest, and there will be food shortages. There are two ways to provide relief: addressing the root cause and addressing the symptoms. Measures such as opening and dredging rivers, digging artesian wells, and organizing farmers' cooperatives to provide credit loans are all fundamental solutions. However, in the face of a severe drought, these measures are too slow to be effective. Therefore, we have to consider addressing the symptoms. What the farmers in this city want and urgently need now is a sufficient supply of water. At this moment, most of the rivers in the urban areas are dry. For the time being, we can only find ways to divert water from the main rivers into the tributaries, and then farmers can draw water from the tributaries to irrigate their fields. Therefore, at the municipal affairs meeting yesterday morning, we discussed emergency relief measures and agreed that we should first purchase a large number of water lifting machines and distribute them to various districts, and send engineers to guide the diversion of water and the construction of dams. We should carefully plan relief measures according to the special circumstances of each district. We know that the city treasury is extremely tight, but this matter concerns the people's food, so we have to reluctantly provide support. We decided to proceed as planned and immediately handed it over to the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Finance, Land, and Public Security Bureaus, to proceed as quickly as possible to relieve the people's plight and satisfy the farmers' expectations. The fundamental solutions should still be planned as soon as possible, so we have also ordered the competent authorities to carefully discuss the methods and implement them step by step.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Public Announcement of Machine Purchase <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued a public announcement yesterday, stating that since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rainfall and the weather has been hot and severely dry. The rice seedlings in the farmland are gradually withering. In addition to sending personnel to various districts and towns to inspect the disaster situation, the bureau intends to purchase water lifting machines for relief purposes to avoid affecting the agricultural harvest. If you have pumps ranging from six to twelve horsepower, please provide details of the following items: 1. How much water is discharged per hour? 2. What kind of oil is used for the engine? 3. What is the value? Please come to the bureau to discuss this today (the 14th) from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM so that we can make purchases. This is hereby announced.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, dozens of representatives from the Municipal Farmers' Association and various district farmers' associations departed from the North Station and went to the city's central district to petition the city government. At this time, the city government was holding a municipal affairs meeting and had already discussed the drought prevention issue in detail, deciding to allocate funds to purchase a large number of water lifting machines and distribute them to various rural districts for application. Mayor Wu then sent Wu Huanru, the second section chief of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, to receive them on his behalf. Yu Zhenhui, a standing committee member of the Municipal Farmers' Association, stated their intention. Section Chief Wu then relayed the discussion of the municipal affairs meeting to the representatives and hoped that the representatives could assist the government in drought prevention efforts.

<h3 id="e127">Petition to Ban Slaughter <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The initiators, the Joint Association of Charitable Organizations and more than 30 other organizations, jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting that they issue an order to ban slaughter and seek rain, and at the same time, all the initiating organizations have been vegetarian since yesterday. The original text reads: "Presenting [this petition] because the drought has become a disaster, and dangerous situations are all around, sincerely requesting prayer for rain and a ban on slaughter to seek remedy, earnestly requesting review and approval. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been without rain since the beginning of summer. During the plum season, the weather is hot and dry, like a scorching summer. The ditches and canals are dry, and the farmland is cracked. There is no land for planting, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Looking ahead, we cannot help but tremble. The rural areas of our country have been bankrupt in recent years, and everything on the market is declining day by day. If another disaster occurs and this ray of hope is extinguished, the social situation will be truly precarious. We are worried about: First, in recent years, there have been repeated disasters of war, floods, and droughts in various provinces, and all rely on Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to find ways to provide relief. If Jiangsu and Zhejiang also suffer a disaster, who will help? We will have to wait to die with our hands tied. We are worried about: Second, recently, the interior provinces have been filled with party bandits, half of whom are forced by hunger and cold. If a disaster occurs, like sparrows driven by a flock of birds, the good and weak people will also take risks. The example of the roving bandits of the late Ming Dynasty can serve as a warning. We are worried about: Third, diseases are rampant and deaths are increasing daily. If it does not rain again, the heat will continue to rise, and it will inevitably lead to a great epidemic that cannot be saved. We are worried about: Fourth, the signs of Heaven are actually transferred by human affairs. In the past, government offices often prayed to the gods and prohibited slaughter during floods and droughts. Heaven and man responded, and every request was answered. This is not superstition, but pleading for the people. Now the drought has become a disaster, and dangerous situations are all around. People are panicking and cannot live in peace. Christians are already praying for rain. Therefore, we respectfully request the government to cherish the people as if they were injured, embody Heaven's virtue of loving life, hold prayer for rain and ban slaughter to advocate this, and at the same time, issue an order to all counties and subordinates to sincerely observe it. With the spirit inspired, there is hope that sweet rain will fall immediately. The matter is urgent, and the way is in sincerity. Please quickly implement it. The benefits will be unimaginable." In addition to submitting separate reports, this is respectfully presented to Chen, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Lu, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association, the Chinese Buddhist Association, and more than 30 other organizations, Wang Zhen, Huang Qinglan, Qu Yingguang, Du Yong, Zhang Yin, Guan Jiong, Wang Junsheng, and more than 60 other gentlemen.</p>

Shandong Province is on the right track politically, and the finances are well managed. It is making efforts to abolish excessive taxes. Hebei Province is not yet restored. The people in the remaining counties are also more painful. Fortunately, Chairman Yu is responsible for his work and handles everything in accordance with the central government's intentions, but there are too many stationed troops, and there are occasional requisitions, which should be remedied. The atmosphere in Beijing is very good. Minister He is serious in his work. The generals in North China are united in good faith and have a harmonious relationship with He. Shanxi Yan advocates the construction and development of the Northwest. Shanxi is reducing its troops, and the reduced military expenditure will be used for construction. It is working on abolishing excessive taxes, which will reduce the burden on the people by more than 600,000 yuan per year. Shao and Yang in Shaanxi are working hard together and have a harmonious relationship with the people. The stationed troops are carrying out road construction, and the future is optimistic. Henan Province has had a good harvest this year, which is a great improvement compared to five years ago. All provinces can fully express the efforts of the local government. At the same time, the people in various places are also aware of the need to support the central government, unite, and work hard to save the country.</p>

<p>A banking syndicate is forming to develop cotton production in the Northwest. Mr. Sun Enjun, member of the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee and director of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, visited the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi last month to investigate and implement measures related to cotton production in the Northwest and to handle the affairs of cotton production and sales cooperatives. He has now completed his official duties and arrived in Shanghai yesterday by boat from Nantong. According to Mr. Sun, the rainfall in the Northwest this year has been favorable, resulting in a better agricultural harvest compared to previous years, especially for cotton. The Cotton Industry Control Committee is currently establishing large-scale cotton production and sales cooperatives in the Shaanxi and Henan areas and is introducing Shanghai banks to invest in them. The loans for these cooperatives are divided into three categories: 1) cotton harvesting, 2) ginning, and 3) credit cooperation. The total investment required is approximately two million yuan, with the first category accounting for the majority. The second and third categories account for only 15%, approximately 300,000 yuan. Banks such as Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, National Industrial Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Jin Cheng Bank have already formed a cotton production and sales cooperative investment banking syndicate to share the investment amounts. Except for the Bank of China, which still needs to be contacted, the rest have already signed contracts.</p>

<p>The content is divided into five categories, including industry, and has been submitted to the Guangxi Provincial Government for approval. China's southwestern provinces have a warm climate and abundant resources, making them a treasure trove. However, due to the difficult local financial situation, various resources have not been developed, leading to wasted resources and opportunities for foreign goods to flood the market. The Shanghai banking sector, recognizing this, is actively investing in the Southwest to enrich the people's livelihood. All construction plans have already been drafted, and the details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Investment Methods for the Southwest Finalized <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai banking sector believes that China's southwestern provinces are rich in resources and have great potential for development. Therefore, they have repeatedly gathered to discuss investment methods as a starting point for the construction of the Southwest. However, due to the lack of concrete cooperation among the banks, a practical plan has not been finalized for a long time. To expedite the process, they specially appointed Mr. Jin Guoshi, manager of the Bank of Communications, to draft an investment plan, which has now been completed. The content is divided into five parts: 1) rural water conservancy and agricultural finance, 2) industry and mining, 3) commerce, 4) transportation, and 5) finance. The document is 100,000 characters long and has been submitted to the Guangxi Provincial Government for approval. It will then be printed as a booklet and distributed to various financial groups for study.</p>

<p>Mr. Jin Guobao told a Dagong Daily reporter yesterday about the development plan for the Southwest, stating that the economic construction of provinces such as Guangxi should focus on agriculture, improving its technology, providing capital, afforestation, water management, pest control, and disaster prevention to increase harvests. Improving transportation methods to facilitate transportation, establishing factories to accommodate by-products, establishing transportation and sales companies to facilitate sales, modifying tax rules to lighten burdens and facilitate promotion, popularizing cooperative organizations to consolidate the rural foundation, utilizing financial policies to develop agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises, rigorously implementing austerity measures, improving efficiency to achieve rationalization, and utilizing fiscal policies to control foreign trade to pioneer a planned economy. The way to manage water is still through water storage, flood prevention, and irrigation. In this way, the quality can be improved, production can be increased, and a permanent plan can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Implementing the Reorganization of Brokerage Tax, Prohibiting Forced Solicitation of Customers and Goods, and Restricting the Collection of Commissions: The Ministry of Finance Issues Seven Directives for Compliance <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance believes that the brokerage tax in various provinces and cities is rife with abuses. At the recent National Financial Conference, it was resolved to reorganize the brokerage tax with seven measures. Yesterday, it specifically informed various provinces and cities to instruct the financial departments to comply with the measures. The directive has already arrived in Shanghai, and its measures are excerpted as follows: 1) Limiting Brokerage Firms: Brokerage firms must have fixed business locations in county, city, town, and market trading locations to obtain a license to operate, regardless of short or long term. 2) Defining Brokerage Firm Responsibilities: Brokerage firms are the key intermediaries for goods transactions and must not operate privately without a license or use one license for multiple purposes, nor should they engage in forced solicitation of customers and goods that resemble monopolies. 3) Restricting Brokerage Commissions: Brokerage firms' commission rates vary greatly across provinces and cities, ranging from about 7% to 5%. Given the current difficulties faced by farmers and businesses and the low prices, it seems appropriate to restrict them. It is proposed to set the limit at 3%, with each province and city considering local trading conditions and determining the restriction accordingly. 4) Brokerage Business Tax: The standard for brokerage taxation should be based on the amount of sales and commissions. The standard for brokerage taxation varies across provinces, which inevitably leads to uneven burdens. When opening a brokerage firm, fees should be paid and a license obtained in accordance with regulations. The annual brokerage business tax should be based on the amount of sales, and the provincial finance departments should formulate measures based on the old system, refer to the current situation, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval. If the tax is collected based on the amount of sales, the tax rate must not exceed 3%. If it is based on commissions, the tax rate must not exceed 20%. 5) Wandering Brokerage Tax Should Be Abolished: The nature of brokerage firms varies across provinces and cities. Some brokers and their associates operate in the open air without fixed business locations, despite having licenses and collecting commissions. They arbitrarily collect brokerage fees and cause illegal disturbances, which should be gradually abolished. Fixed business locations should be established to comply with regulations. The steps for abolition should be determined by each province and city, but must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. 6) Correcting Illegal and Excessive Collection Practices: Most provinces and cities comply with regulations regarding brokerage tax, but there are occasional violations, such as setting up checkpoints at trading markets to collect taxes or having merchants bid for contracts, which are burdensome. These practices should be quickly reformed to ensure that tax revenue and commercial conditions are considered together. Bad habits should be gradually abolished after the contract period expires, based on the circumstances. 7) Brokerage Firm Operating Regulations Should Be Specified: When establishing a brokerage firm, guarantees must be provided. The trading methods of brokerage firms vary across provinces, leading to many abuses. For thorough reform, provinces and cities should be required to formulate regulations based on local conditions and submit them to the Ministry for approval. Brokerage firms are responsible for local transactions, and strict regulation is necessary. In particular, consolidation should be prioritized to avoid complexity. When establishing a brokerage firm, guarantees must be provided. If the firm operates legally after establishment, the government should also provide protection. Provinces and cities should formulate appropriate regulations based on local conditions and submit them to the Ministry for approval.</p>

<p>Mr. Welch said that when the plane was ascending, the speed reached 310 miles per hour, and there was no danger. When descending, the engine should be stopped as usual. However, in mid-air, the plane suddenly shook violently. He knew he was in danger and believed that the wing had fallen off. He jumped out with a parachute at only 400 feet above the ground. Fortunately, he landed in a small river and suffered only minor injuries. If he had landed on land, even if he had not died, he would have been seriously injured because he was too close to the ground.</p>

The letter stated that since the September 18th Incident, the industry has followed other sectors in organizing a donation committee to raise funds in a short period of time to purchase aircraft for the government. However, since the January 28th Incident, the commercial situation has deteriorated, making it difficult to achieve the goal of purchasing aircraft. As a result, the 11,333 yuan raised has been handed over to the office for allocation to national aviation defense. The letter also included a list of donors, including: Yufeng 400 yuan, Xingshuntai, Ruichangshun, Shenji, and Zhengji 300 yuan each, Lao Shunji, Xinshunji, Yuji, Yongtongchang, Zhengdaxiang, Yishunchang, Hengdachang, Qiantaixiang, Yichangsheng, Shunli, Huafeng, Tongyihe, Xiangdayuan, Shentai, Yongchang, Yichang, Cai Renmao, Guangrongtai 200 yuan each, Shengchang 150 yuan, Zhao Xianji, Xinshunchang, Yongchangtai, Jinchangxiang, Xiexing, Rongxiangtai, Shenxing, Hengdaxiang, Hengtaichunji, Xietai, Yuantaishenzhuang, Tongxinhe, Xinchangheng, Xiangtai, Lao Dahengchang, Fuchang, Ruichang, Jinhegong, Xingchang, Tongchang, Fengda, Lida, Yongshengyuan, Yongyuanchang, Yuanheng, Zhenchang, Donglai, Yongyuanxiang, Lao Shuntai, Yida, Huichang, Xintongchang, Lichang, Yilong, Deda, Yongji, Taiyuan, Dachangxing 100 yuan each, Changji, Junji, Hongshun, Runchang, Shunchang, Huacheng, Lao Yikang 50 yuan each, Xindachang 38 yuan, Tongfeng 30 yuan, Youchang, Hongchangxiang 20 yuan each, Yuanshen 10 yuan, Huang Yushen, Yu Bingyong, and Tong Kuixian 100 yuan each, Fu Zhenyuan, Zhang Xinghui, Chen Guohua, and China Steelware Company 50 yuan each, Yan Jingbo and Xie Xuanqian (jointly) 50 yuan, Dong Zhengqing and Lin Pengfei (jointly) 50 yuan, Yu Shaofu 40 yuan, Le Songxiong, Zhang Zufang, and Fang Zhengkang 30 yuan each, Chen Xianglin, Tang Xianglun, Wang Bangfu, Lin Lianjia, Maolong Foreign Firm, Jin Shenqing, Wang Zixi, Tang Xianxi, Wu Shichang, Yao Maosen, Zhang Mingyuan 20 yuan each, Shen Chuheng, Qiu Huitang, Shi Bingyu, Gao Xing Foreign Firm, Zheng Zhennian,</p>

<h3 id="e154">First Announcement on Cholera Prevention: First Document from the Temporary Office <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office issued its first announcement yesterday: 1) Although no true cholera cases have been found in Shanghai this summer, the weather is extremely dry and the heat is very high. The temperature reached 104.4 degrees on the 12th of this month, breaking the local observatory's historical record. Only 1894 was hotter, but it only reached 102.9 degrees. The current extreme heat started on June 25th, when the temperature was 101.5 degrees and the relative humidity was 76.9. Except for June 29th and July 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, the temperature gradually increased thereafter, reaching 104.4 degrees on the 12th. The average relative humidity on July 1st was 67.7, with the highest being 9.5 on June 30th. There was no rain during this period, only two thunderstorms. There was a slight rain on the 18th, measuring 0.02 inches. The drought this year is already a cause for concern. 2) One cholera case was found in Guangzhou on June 9th, two cases were found in Hankou on July 4th, and one case was found in Manila on July 6th. No cases have been found in Shanghai. 3) Due to the extreme heat, many citizens have suffered from heatstroke and have been treated in hospitals. The Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital treated a Chinese patient whose temperature reached 108.4 degrees and whose pulse was 146, but the patient did not die. Most patients suffer from gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea, and typhoid fever. 4) With the consultation of Mayor Wu and the health authorities of the concessions, the local water company is, as in previous years, providing free tap water to the poor. Tap water faucets are installed on the streets. Nanshi and Zhabei each receive 1 million gallons of free water per month. If this amount is exceeded, the municipal government will subsidize the cost at a rate of 30 cents per thousand gallons. This is because cholera prevention is closely related to the cleanliness of drinking water. 5) In addition, the health authorities of the concessions and Shanghai are working hard to implement prevention methods such as publicity lectures, distributing leaflets, posting slogans, and free injections to achieve the desired preventive effect. 6) As of the end of June, the number of people who have received anti-cholera injections is as follows: Shanghai 164,279 people, Public Concession 96,081 people, French Concession 45,079 people, Railway Bureau Health Section 5,403 people, totaling 310,842 people. 7) Individuals can avoid cholera by paying attention to hygiene. Drinking water must be clean. Cold drinks and ice cream must be purchased from reliable manufacturers. Fresh fruits must be washed with boiling water. Attention must be paid to the utensils used to avoid contamination by servants. Raw vegetables and uncooked foods are best avoided. Each household should ensure that its servants receive free preventive injections. 8) The first meeting of the year was held on April 24th, chaired by Director of the Health Department Liu Ruiheng. The Epidemiology Group held three meetings, and the Publicity Group held two meetings. One point that should be noted is that cholera vibrio with weak agglutination was found three times in the river and pond water samples taken in May and June. This point is important for the study of cholera epidemics. 9) As in previous years, various epidemic hospitals have opened to accommodate patients. The following hospitals have a total of 1,000 beds: Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, Public Works Bureau Isolation Hospital, Nanshi Public Hospital, Tangshan Road Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, Nanshi Society Epidemic Hospital, Nanshi Shenzhou Hospital, and Hongkou Civilian Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Business Community Calls for Amendment of the New Tariff <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods believes that the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the new tariff has a significant impact on the future of national goods. Therefore, the 14th session of the 8th Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee resolved to convene a special committee meeting to discuss the matter and seek relief. The association held a temporary meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee at the Nine Mu Di meeting hall yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Twenty-eight executive committee members attended. Chen Binghui was elected as chairman. The committee members braved the summer heat to attend and discussed the matter in detail for three hours. Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong, standing committee members of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, telegraphed various ministries and departments of the Nanjing National Government, requesting the Ministry of Finance to revise the new tariff.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Paper Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the new tariff, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for amendment.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Tobacco and Wine Industry Representatives Petitioned the Finance Bureau Yesterday for Licenses: Due to Commercial Recession, They Requested Payment of Taxes as Usual; Section Chief Received Them and Agreed to Forward the Petition to the Director <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Various associations in the local tobacco exchange, soy sauce and wine, Fenjiu, Liangshao, restaurants and bars, Western tobacco, sauce gardens, Shaoxing wine, dry tobacco, and local yellow wine industries, including Chen Liangyu, Shen Weiting (represented by Zhang Songji), Yang Qiaosheng, Song Liren, Cheng Gengli, Zhu Ligong, and Zhu Shujian, were elected as representatives and went to the Finance Bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to petition. Section Chief Wang of the First Section received them. The representatives submitted a petition and stated the difficulties faced by the two industries, saying that the current Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business License Tax promulgated by the Ministry had achieved the best results in Shanghai since its announcement in July of the 20th year of the Republic. However, most retail stores in the two industries paid 2 yuan per period, and since the two periods were changed to four periods, coupled with the impact of the January 28th Incident, the business strength could no longer bear the burden. In the counties north of the Yangtze River, small households pay 30 copper coins or a few cents per quarter, while large wineries with three or four storefronts pay only 3-4 yuan per quarter. Moreover, the situation in Shanghai is special. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt, commerce is depressed, and the weather is extremely hot and drought has set in, they requested to continue paying taxes at the old rate to maintain their livelihoods. Once the market prospers, they will persuade members to pay as much as possible. Section Chief Wang said that the Bureau would abide by the Ministry's regulations. Since the representatives had detailed the commercial situation, he agreed to forward the situation to the Director, with the main goal of showing compassion for the difficulties of businesses. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew. The petition is excerpted as follows: "Regarding the petition, the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax has always been handled by the Ministry of Finance through the establishment of a bureau. Because Shanghai has special circumstances in the Chinese and Concession areas, slight adjustments have been made to the regulations. Therefore, the procedures for the two industries to pay taxes have followed the old practices for many years, and new licenses have been exchanged for old ones, and all has been well. Since July 1st of this year, the Bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Finance to take over the handling of the license tax, and provisional regulations and implementation rules for the tobacco and alcohol license tax have been promulgated, and forms must be filled out and registered. After receiving the order, the members of the two industries have come to the association to inquire about the details and request that the license tax continue to be handled in accordance with the old practices to alleviate business difficulties. The association believes that taxation is the responsibility of the local government and should be treated equally. We have always admired your bureau's understanding of the commercial situation, and your knowledge is accurate. We should show special consideration. However, the reasons for the historical evolution and the special circumstances of Shanghai must be explained to the Bureau for your information. 1) There are no fewer than several thousand tobacco exchange and soy sauce and wine shops in Shanghai, whether they are dedicated or兼售 retail stores. The majority of the stores in the Chinese area of the two industries are small businesses. Although they are open shops, the difficulties of business and the meager profits are the same as those of retail stalls. The stores all rely on diligence and thrift to maintain themselves and make a living. The tax bureau in each term has taken this into account and略予 changes to the collection and payment续, and has collected them in two periods. Since the 17th year of the Republic, it has been changed to four seasons, and the amount of tax has been reduced appropriately. Therefore, at the beginning of each quarter, new licenses are exchanged for old ones as usual, and there is no change in the method. This is the actual situation of the historical evolution. 2) The tobacco and alcohol stores in Shanghai are adjacent to the concession, and the business situation has always been very different. Since the impact of the Zaishi Incident, commerce has declined day by day, and the tobacco and alcohol stores have been particularly affected. For example, in the Zhabei area, there were more than 1,000 tobacco exchange and soy sauce and tobacco shops, but now there are only 400-500. In other places such as Hunan and Hubei, the indirect impact is not small. In addition, in recent years, housing prices have increased and the foreign exchange rate has soared, so the stores in the two industries have suffered huge losses, and closures are frequent. Therefore, the tax bureau in recent years has handled the collection procedures in accordance with the usual tax payment methods to avoid increasing the burden on merchants. This is the real situation of Shanghai's special circumstances. In the light of the above statement of the reasons, the business difficulties of our members are indeed true. We have always admired Jun Chang's concern for the difficulties of businesses and his thorough understanding of the economic situation of Shanghai's business. For this reason, we have jointly submitted this petition and sent representatives to explain the reasons for the petition,环求 Jun Ju, taking into account the commercial situation and the special circumstances of Shanghai, to allow the old methods to continue to be used, to exchange old licenses for new ones, and to avoid increasing the burden. It is a great convenience. I respectfully上云云."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Public Works Department: Policy Should Consider Citizens' Opinions; The Primary Goal of Municipal Governance Should Be to Ensure Citizen Understanding <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that on the twelfth of this month, we received a letter from the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association stating that during the Fifth Member Representative Congress, the bicycle manufacturing and ham industries requested that the Public Works Department of the Concession fully consider the opinions of those concerned in all matters of importance to the business community. The Congress, after deliberation, deemed that the Public Works Department should be requested to adopt this proposal as much as possible. However, the Public Works Department of the Concession, in its measures concerning the affiliated trade associations, only submits proposals from the Health Department to the Board of Directors for approval, and then implements them immediately. The facilities proposed by the Health Bureau are not necessarily appropriate and without drawbacks. For example, the newly established cattle slaughterhouse requires that all unslaughtered cattle be kept in the slaughterhouse, with a fee of two dimes per cow per day. However, in practice, the cows are only kept and not cared for, and the vendors still have to manage them themselves, thus burdening the affiliated trade associations with an additional accommodation fee of two dimes per cow per day. Such measures are already felt to be difficult to sustain in the long run. If, in the future, there continue to be measures unfavorable to the affiliated trade associations, implemented abruptly without giving colleagues full consideration, disputes over gains and losses will inevitably arise. Therefore, we earnestly request that you order the Public Works Department Board of Directors and the Health Department to forward the content of any major events related to the affiliated trade associations to your organization in advance, and then forward them to the affiliated associations for thorough consideration to determine whether they can be implemented, so as to achieve a satisfactory outcome and avoid disputes, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<p>The letter also stated that the Chamber of Commerce had previously sent a letter to the Public Works Department, citing the precedents of the Municipal Government soliciting the opinions of relevant businesses when handling business taxes and the Public Works Department changing pawnshop license fees to avoid misunderstandings, and stating that such fair policies should be gradually expanded in scope to enhance Chinese-foreign relations. The letter has been sent for many days but no reply has been received. Now, based on the contents of the public association's letter, the Chamber of Commerce needs to further explain the previous letter and call attention to the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department is handling municipal administration on the one hand, and also involving the interests of merchants on the other. Therefore, it is more appropriate to solicit the opinions of merchants as much as possible in advance. Otherwise, once a decision is made and implemented, the Public Works Department believes that its authority is at stake. A wise municipal government that understands the difficulties of merchants will certainly make citizen understanding the primary goal. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce earnestly hopes that the Public Works Department can adopt the aforementioned approach."</p>
<h3 id="e158">Silver Craftsmen's Strike Resolved: Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Five Resolution Measures Signed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>All workers at Sun Wanlong's silver shop in this city went on strike to protest the boss's deduction of wages. Labor and management agreed that prolonging the dispute was not a good strategy, and specially invited Mr. Dai Youheng to mediate. With both parties agreeing, a resolution was announced, and it was decided that all workers would resume work on the 15th of this month. The resolution measures are as follows: 1. The prices specified in the wage book will still be settled according to those prices and cannot be reduced. 2. The mediation methods of the former General Labor Union have been signed by both parties and must still be implemented according to the original methods. For example, the price for making a modern frame, sized from three to six inches, is 3.5 dimes per inch. Currently, the price for the raw frame, sized from three to six inches, is 4 dimes per inch. Commemorative cups, jars with lids, glass-encased cups, etc., will be calculated according to the decision of the General Labor Union. For new life items, etc., the two public associations will jointly study and decide. The price for making a blank will be calculated at 3 cents per tael. 3. After the dispute is resolved, workers shall not be dismissed for any reason, and there shall be no further deduction of wages. 4. During the suspension of work, the boss will provide each worker with a discretionary allowance of three yuan in silver dollars for meals. 5. All workers are permitted to resume work on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Demolition Dispute in Yongren Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei: Landlord Xiangfeng Company Forcibly Evicting Tenants; Residents Petition the Municipal Government for Relief <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Yongren Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei, claiming that the landlord, Xiangfeng Company, was forcibly evicting them under the pretext of renovation after failing to increase the rent, specially petitioned the Municipal Government for relief yesterday. The petition stated: "Petition for prompt prevention of forced eviction under the pretext of renovation after a failed rent increase, to ensure the peace of residents. We, the petitioners, are all tenants of Yongren Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei. The buildings in the lane were constructed in the third and fourth years of the Republic. At that time, prices were low and materials were solid. Although they are twenty years old, they show no signs of collapse. With minor repairs each year, they can last another twenty years without worry. The previous landlord of the lane, Mr. Yao, treated the tenants with great consideration. Even those who owed rent for seven or eight months were not troubled. In the autumn of the twentieth year of the Republic, the property was sold to the current landlord, Xiangfeng Company. During the transition, the former landlord declared to the tenants that all owed rent would be waived, and that future arrangements should be discussed with the new landlord. Soon after, the new landlord announced that renovation would be used as a tool to increase rent, and asked the tenants to send representatives to negotiate. Representatives such as Chen Yongqing were elected to negotiate with the manager, Gu Zhongyuan. After much effort, an agreement was reached: the rent for each building would be increased by two yuan, and the owed rent would be paid in two months, with the remaining owed rent being sacrificed. There would be no further rent increases within five years, and there should be no more arrears thereafter. It is found that when the house was purchased, the house and land were worth only 15,000 yuan, and the monthly rent was about 400 yuan, and the annual interest rate was 3.2%. Unexpectedly, the landlord was driven by greed and, in the face of a depressed market and the unrecovered vitality of Zhabei, when the whole of Shanghai was calling for rent reductions, the manager, Gu Zhongyuan, summoned the tenants' representatives to negotiate and proposed inhumane conditions: the previous contract would be cancelled, and the rent for each house would be increased from 12 yuan to 22 yuan, and a three-month deposit was to be paid in advance. The representatives were shocked by this news. After consultation, the tenants unanimously rejected it. Because the landlord's intention to increase the rent was not realized, the ambition was difficult to fulfill, and the landlord secretly reported to the Public Works Bureau to apply for a building permit, as a tool to intimidate and force the eviction, in order to fulfill the purpose of increasing the rent. The petitioners are in a deep and fiery situation, and have no choice but to elect the petitioners as representatives to petition (remainder omitted).</p>

<p>Sun Wende, a native of Funing residing in a flat at No. 56 Zhangjia Bang, Yangshupu, recently worked as a detective in the police organs of the Chinese and foreign concessions. At 9:45 p.m. on February 12th of this year, he was shot and wounded in the shoulder and waist by an enemy, attempting to take his life. The perpetrator fled without a trace. Previously, Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession arrested three bandits from Funing, including Xu Fasheng, in Caishi Street. After investigation by the Second Special Court, Xu was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. Later, Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu police station, discovered that Xu was the assailant who shot and attempted to murder Sun Wende. He reported to the First Special District Court and requested that Xu be transferred to the Third Criminal Court. After the victim confirmed the identity, the court ordered a sentence to be pronounced on a fixed date. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the court and sentenced Xu Fasheng to fourteen years of imprisonment. Before the judgment is final, the number of days of detention will be counted as one day off for every two days of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Lawyers Association Requests Attention to Scheduling: Letter to the First Special District Court <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association wrote to the Shanghai First Special District District Court yesterday, requesting attention to court scheduling: "We are writing to inform you that, according to member Chen Tingrui's statement at the 172nd Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee meeting of the Association, a member was representing Hongshen Real Estate Company in a case of rent arrears and eviction against Henglong Rice Store (Case No. 3466, Jianzi [Simplified Character] Year 22). The Shanghai First Special District District Court scheduled the hearing for 1:00 p.m. on the 29th of last month in the Fourteenth Tribunal. The member arrived at the court on time to report. However, that afternoon, the tribunal had 22 cases scheduled. It was not until after 5:00 p.m. that the member's case had not yet been heard. Because the member had other important matters to attend to, he could no longer wait and had to report the reason to the court's reporting office and leave. It is noted that litigants and their representatives comply with the court's scheduled hearing time and arrive in court to respond to inquiries. After the adjournment, they often have to handle other matters. The court specifies the time for litigants or their representatives to arrive in court on time in order to avoid delays and to hear the cases in order. This time, the member's case was delayed for several hours, not only causing the member and the client to suffer the pain of waiting for a long time and wasting time, but also affecting other litigants or their representatives. Moreover, from the court's perspective, more than 20 cases were scheduled in one tribunal within three or four hours. It is not only that one judge's energy is limited and cannot handle everything, but also that the parties and their representatives are simply wasting their time waiting in vain. It is also conceivable that it is not possible to ask and examine each case in detail. The court should pay special attention to this situation and correct it. It is proposed that this should be reviewed and decided on. Accordingly, a letter is sent to you, requesting that the court adopt and implement it for the benefit of litigation, and to strengthen public friendship."</p>

<p>Yuan Weiting, a native of Jingjiang, has been running the Zheng Changxiang cigarette paper shop at No. 196 Waitan Road, South City, for years. Yesterday morning, at around 11:00 a.m., A Jiang, the old steward from the kitchen of the Taizhou Steamer, brought 120 silver dollars from a customer and handed them over to Yuan Weiting, the shop owner. While Yuan was checking the accounts, two robbers suddenly broke in: one wearing a white cloth shirt and black pants with a straw hat, and the other wearing a black gauze short shirt and pants. They brandished weapons and told the shop owner and others not to make a sound. They were robbed of 104 silver dollars. After the robbery, the robbers fled with the loot towards Limailu. Yang Yousong, a police officer from Post No. 3, Zone 1 of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned of the incident and rushed to the scene, but the robbers had already fled far away. He then accompanied the victim to the zone and reported the incident to the zone chief, requesting assistance in the arrest.</p>

<p>Lawyer Yan Luqing has an office at No. 49 Sichuan Road. Previously, on behalf of Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador from Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm, he accused Zhu Zhangming of Ruichangshun Hardware Store, Zhuang Jimeng of Zhuang Yuanda Trough and Workshop, Wang Lianyou, a hardware runner, and Tang Qingyue, president of Dade Hospital, of theft, and filed a private prosecution. After investigation by Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court, Zhang and the other three were acquitted. During the court debate, Tang's defense lawyers, Sun Zuji and Chen Tingrui, repeatedly stated in court that Lawyer Yan</p>
<h3 id="e165">Extorted Tang <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Two thousand yuan. Therefore, Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, attached great importance to this case within a case. In addition to the Lawyer Disciplinary Committee of the Third High Court deciding to</p>
<h3 id="e166">Suspend Yan's duties, the Chief Prosecutor sent a letter to the Police Department of the French Concession on June 29th, stating, "If it is true that Yan Luqing, et al., used improper means such as intimidation and fraud to extort money from others, it would be a violation of criminal law. Please handle it according to law." Therefore, on the afternoon of the 10th, the Police Department ordered detectives to bring the witnesses to the police station for interrogation. As a result, the police station filed a public prosecution for the crime of intimidating and defrauding property under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>

<p>to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. At 11:00 a.m., Judge Xiong Huiping interrogated Yan Luqing about his age and place of origin. Then, Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan from the police station explained the case. Next, Tang Qingyue was interrogated, stating, "The 2,000 yuan was given to the defendant by my father." According to my father, if this money was not given, they would have to insist that I was a thief. The judge asked Yan Luqing whether he had taken this money. Yan replied that he had not taken it. However, Sun Zuji called me and asked me to help. He also asked if money had been mentioned. Yan replied that on the afternoon of the 20th, Sun Zuji called and said that Tang Qingyue had been accused of theft. He asked whether two representatives could represent the client's side and help. I replied that I was a representative, but I could only help with the private prosecution, not the public prosecution. After I told the client about this, Sun Zuji called again to inquire. At 8:00 p.m., Zhou Jinggeng and I were having dinner at a western restaurant downstairs from my office when Sun Zuji and Qin Daoyuan came. I greeted them, but the client did not want to talk to Sun, so he asked me to go and talk. Therefore, I accompanied Sun and the others to the office. Qin Daoyuan said that he and Tang Qingyue were in the same industry and asked me to help. Sun Zuji offered 500 yuan, which he later increased to 4,000 yuan. I said that I could not help with the public prosecution. They said that if I could not help, they would hire Lawyer Chen Tingrui to litigate tomorrow. I thought that there was no point in continuing the conversation, so I pushed Sun and Qin out the door, fearing that they would hold a grudge because of this insult. The judge asked if there were any further conversations. Yan replied that there were no further conversations, only that he had talked to the client about settling the private prosecution for 2,000 yuan. He was asked if he was present at the scene, and replied that he was not.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The witnesses Sun Zuji, Tang Wenshou, Pan Hongding, <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Qin Daoyuan, and Zhou Jinggeng were summoned to the court. After briefly questioning their age and place of origin, Tang Wenshou submitted a statement stating that he wanted to file a private prosecution against Yan and Zhou. The judge said that the police station had only accused Yan Luqing, not Zhou Jinggeng. He could only claim restitution from Yan. Tang said that he would withdraw the charges against Zhou Jinggeng. At this point, the judge ordered separate interrogations. First, Tang Wenshou was interrogated. He stated that Qingyue was his son, and after he was falsely accused of theft, Lawyer Sun said that Yan Luqing and Zhou Jinggeng came to demand money. The judge asked where and when the money was handed over, and to whom. He replied that it was handed over to Pan Hongding at his home at 12:30 p.m. on the 11th, and Pan sent it to Sun Zuji's office in the Mainland Commercial Center, and then to Yan. According to Pan, if this money was not given,</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Dayang Bridge Strike Subsides <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Business resumed completely yesterday morning after persuasion. Wang Binyan, et al., petitioned the Security Office. Director Yang ordered the Second Regiment Commander to investigate the Dayang Bridge Lidi Port shop strike case. Business resumed yesterday morning after persuasion from all walks of life. Meanwhile, all walks of life in Zhabei petitioned Director Yang, and Yang promised to strictly handle the matter. The details are as follows: Persuading to Open Business: At 7:30 yesterday morning, Gong Kui, the chief of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau, Jiang Zisheng, the president of the Shanghai North Rice Industry Association, Wang Binyan and Cai Qiaojun, leaders of various public organizations in Zhabei, Yuan Hongjun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Yichen and Zhang Xianfang of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, along with Yang Qicheng and Zhang Mengkui, representatives of Dayang Bridge, went to Lidi Port, Dayang Bridge, to persuade the merchants to open business first. They decided to ask Director Yang to strictly handle the injury part separately. After the representatives' earnest persuasion, the merchants fired firecrackers and opened their doors at 8:00 a.m., resuming normal business.</p>
<p>Sending Condolences: At 8:30 a.m., Wang Binyan and Cai Qiaojun, representatives of the Zhabei merchants, and Yuan Hongjun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, went to No. 114, Buck Road, Shilong Hospital, to express their condolences to Sun Guifang, the manager of Hesheng Xieji Rice Store, and advised him to rest and recuperate.</p>
<p>Petitioning Yang: At 9:00 a.m., Wang Binyan, Cai Qiaojun, Zhang Yichen, and Zhang Xianfang prepared a letter and went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask Chairman Yu Zuoting to negotiate. Yu often sent Yuan Hongjun to accompany them to the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Security Office to petition Director Yang Hu, requesting that the perpetrators be severely punished in order to maintain business relations. Yang agreed to order the commander of the Second Regiment to investigate and handle the matter according to law. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Investigation Results: Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News visited Director Yang at the Security Office. Yang was out on official business, and Section Chief Wang received them and reported the investigation results, stating that on the 9th, the cook had given money to buy two dou of rice but was not wearing a uniform. When the weight of the noodles was found to be insufficient, he went to Hesheng Rice Store to inquire. The staff of the rice store poured out the rice and threw the money and cloth bag into the street, and then beat the cook. The cook felt humiliated for no reason and returned to report to his colleagues. He bit to death that Qingyue was a thief, but this money was all savings of daughters and grandsons, which could be proved by withdrawals from the Jing'an Temple Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Then</p>
<h3 id="e170">Interrogating Sun Zuji <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>He said that on the morning of the 20th of last month at 8:00 a.m., he received a phone call from Tang's wife saying that Tang Qingyue had been arrested for theft, and asked me to appear in court to defend him. So I first went to the First Special Court to inquire, and the judge ordered Tang to surrender to the Second Special Court. Afterwards, I called Lawyer Yan Luqing and asked him if he was handling this case, and asked him to handle it carefully. Later, Yan called and said that he would handle it carefully and that he had to exchange conditions. I asked him how to exchange conditions. He said that the client wanted money, and I wanted money too. He asked me to prepare the money quickly, otherwise, he would ask four people to insist that Tang was a robber when the court opened. While we were talking, Lawyer Chen Tingrui arrived. At that time, Yan and Zhou were about to leave. I said that Lawyer Chen could also talk about it. Chen Lawyer said that if I did not give money, what would happen? Yan replied that he would not be polite. Then they dispersed. Later, Yan called again, asking me in Western language if I had made a decision. I did not answer. Later, Yan called again and invited me to talk. So I went with Qin Daoyuan and saw Yan and Zhou having dinner below the office. Yan invited me upstairs, but Yan still insisted on wanting money. I asked him if Tang Qingyue was a thief, was there any conclusive evidence? He said he wouldn't talk about it, but to get the money quickly, or give a receipt. I refused. Yan angrily pushed me out of the door. By the next day, I went to the Second Special Court and heard that Tang could be bailed. Lawyer Chen Tingrui and I went to the New New Modern Clothing Store on Xiafei Road Luban Road to find bail. Unexpectedly, we suddenly saw Yan and Zhou's car coming from behind. They jumped out of the car and still wanted money from us, causing a dispute. Afterwards, we returned to the office. Unexpectedly, Yan and others also came and said to give the money quickly. At this point, Pan Hongding took 2,000 yuan in banknotes from Tang's house, divided it into two packets, and placed it on the desk. Lawyer Yan hurriedly took the banknotes and left.</p>
<p>At that time, it was 12:30 p.m., etc.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Further Interrogation of Witnesses <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The testimonies of Qin Daoyuan and Pan Hongding were similar to that of Lawyer Sun. The judge asked Yan if what the witnesses said was true. Yan Luqing replied that it was not true. I only called Sun Zuji twice. Later, Sun Zuji and Qin Daoyuan came to my office, but the conversation was not pleasant, and I pushed them out. That's all. What they said was completely false. He asked the court to call them to swear in court, and they were all colluding to frame him. He asked for a clear investigation and asked Lawyers Wang Shizong and Zhang Shanle to defend him. He was examined on everything.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Zhou Jinggeng Claims <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of June 24th, I was having dinner with Attorney Yan downstairs at the office when Sun Zuji and Qin Daoyuan arrived. It was inconvenient for me to talk to them, so Attorney Yan went upstairs to talk. Regarding the private prosecution, Sun Zuji voluntarily increased the amount from 500 yuan to 4,000 yuan. As Attorney Yan was also needed for the public prosecution aspect, Attorney Yan pushed them out. Later, on the 21st, I took four witnesses to the police station for questioning. After the interrogation, I returned to the office and, while passing the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan, I encountered Sun Zuji. He called me over to help, willing to settle the private prosecution for 2,000 yuan. Later, he called me to his office. I immediately went to the Continental Arcade and met with Sun. Sun took out banknotes worth 2,000 yuan from an iron box and handed them to me, asking me to issue a receipt. I replied that I could not write, so he wrote it for me, and I signed. The official asked if it was Yan Luqing who advocated this. Zhou replied that it was Sun Zuji who called me to his office to collect the money. The official asked Tang Qingyue, saying, "If you want to accuse Zhou Jinggeng, you must file a separate lawsuit." The interrogation continued until after noon. Secretary Tao read aloud the statements of each person. Judge Xiong announced that the case would be continued on the morning of the 18th of this month to further question witnesses. Yan Luqing paid 8,000 yuan as bail or a guarantee, and then the court adjourned. Later, at 3 PM, Yan was released on bail.</p>
<p>Then went to negotiate, a conflict occurred. The matter was heard by the officer on duty who detained the shop assistant and brought him to the headquarters for questioning, and was released on bail by the Fourth District Director. The officer on duty then requested that the manager go to the headquarters. There was no beating.</p>
<p>The Director's opinion also stated that according to investigators, Officer Bu and Mr. Sun had disagreements on a certain issue, so the merchants' petitions repeatedly stated that Bu Wenbin should be dismissed. However, the fact is that Bu was not on duty when the incident occurred, and if soldiers caused trouble, only the soldiers should be punished. Soldiers are of varying quality, and minor offenses may occur. Looking at the matter in reverse, the merchants were at fault first. Therefore, the Director stated that if the soldiers were indeed violent, they would be punished according to military discipline. It is difficult to remain silent when merchants use this as an excuse to undermine the military's reputation. The Director seemed quite disgruntled, saying that the military cannot cooperate with merchants.</p>
<p>Squad Leader's Talk According to Bu Wenbin, Squad Leader of the 2nd Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Security Bureau, who gave a talk to visitors yesterday morning, stating that the squad absolutely did not purchase rice on credit. The cause of the incident was entirely due to private purchases of rice by the cook, resulting in shortages. Details can be found in the petition published in the newspapers. As for the rice shortage at the shop, he himself had discovered it when purchasing five dou of rice. As for Qian Jihua, the sergeant in the squad, privately dispatching soldiers to arrest the merchant, he has already requested the superiors to punish him. However, the shop's irregular business practices, fabricating facts, confusing the public, and inciting merchants to strike and disrupt social order, are also not blameless. Now that things have come to this, only the superiors can investigate the truth and resolve the matter fairly. One-sided publicity is of no help to the facts. The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Security Bureau yesterday, stating, "Sir, on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from all the shops on Dayang Bridge stating that Wang Yuru, a shop assistant at Hesheng Rice Shop on Dayang Bridge, was brutally beaten by soldiers of the security team, and the manager, Sun Guifang, was also injured. We have already sent a letter to your association requesting assistance. In this autumn of commercial depression, shops are struggling to maintain their business, simply to maintain the market and avoid economic decline. Now, they are subjected to wanton destruction, which chills the hearts of the residents in the area. If we do not fight for justice and allow them to act arbitrarily, merchants will have no peace of mind. Therefore, we again request your association to jointly and urgently negotiate with the city government and the security bureau to severely punish the officers and soldiers who caused the trouble, as well as Squad Leader Bu, to quell public anger and serve as a warning to others. We are deeply grateful, etc. Regarding this matter, according to a joint letter from the shops in the area, we sent a letter to your office on the 11th of this month, requesting that the soldiers involved be investigated and given appropriate punishment, and that your subordinates be warned to strictly enforce military discipline. For several days, the merchants in the area have been afraid to open their shops because they do not know how your office has handled the soldiers involved and are concerned about future protection. The area is still recovering from the Battle of Shanghai, and if it is delayed, it would be contrary to your office's intention to show compassion for the merchants and would be detrimental to international perception. In addition to sending our staff member, Yuan Hongjun, along with representatives from all sectors of Zhabei to persuade the shops to open, we are again conveying the situation to you, hoping that your office will immediately punish the soldiers involved according to the law so that people can gradually feel at ease. This will truly be a public service. This is addressed to the Shanghai City Security Bureau."</p>
<p>Further Recounting the Events Hesheng Rice Shop sent another letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Sir, the case of our shop assistant, Wang Yuru, and manager, Sun Guifang, being beaten by soldiers of the Yangzhou Public Office Security Team has already been reported to your association, requesting that you negotiate with the authorities and request punishment. Today, we read in the Shen Bao newspaper that Squad Leader Bu's report to the Director of the Security Bureau contained many concealments, as if trying to cover up the truth. Regarding the rice purchase on credit, Squad Leader Bu began purchasing rice on credit from our shop from December 10th of last year, totaling one shi and five dou. We repeatedly requested payment, but it has not been settled. He then wanted to purchase on credit again, but we could not allow further debt due to capital constraints, which greatly displeased him. For many days, he was sullen and resentful. Nearby shops are aware of this matter. The rice payment was eventually received with great effort, but the incident had already created animosity. The claim that five dou of rice were purchased with a shortage of twelve jin is absolutely false and purely fabricated. The details are too numerous to mention. Our shop has always been peaceful in its dealings and has never had any disputes that would interfere with business. This time, the team's cook purchased rice at market prices and did not raise prices or speculate. If there was no intention to cause trouble, why would soldiers be brought to the shop to beat up the shop assistant, Wang Yuru, and tie him up and take him to the team? Afterwards, Officer Jiang intervened and returned the rice and money. The bag was returned by Officer Jiang and Platoon Leader Li. Why would the team have considered using bamboo poles to beat up the cook and enter the shop? They grabbed the manager, Sun Guifang, and brutally beat him, immediately tying him up and taking him to the team. Even capturing a major thief would not be done so brutally. At that time, there were countless eyewitnesses. It is not just the words of one or two people that can incite right and wrong. The claim that our shop used its influence to force nearby shops to strike is even more absurd. Our shop manager, Sun Guifang, was seriously injured and hospitalized for treatment. All the shop assistants have scattered. A strike is a most unfortunate event for merchants. Unless there is a matter of great concern, no one would recklessly strike as a painful expression. The situation can be summed up in one sentence, without us having to say more. Moreover, our shop has no prior grudges with the team. Why would we deliberately slander them and accuse them of wrongdoing? We have long admired Director Yang's responsibility for protecting the peace and security of the people. All the merchants who rely on him treat him like a father. However, Dayang Bridge is located in a remote area, beyond the reach of his influence. Although there is a team leader, they each govern a different area. Because the area is vast and the duties are heavy, even if they have eyes and ears everywhere, information is easily distorted through relay. Therefore, we are sincerely explaining the details and true circumstances and earnestly requesting your association to report the true cause of the incident to the city government and the security bureau, severely punish the soldiers involved, and strictly punish the squad leader who failed to maintain discipline, in order to uphold military discipline and maintain commerce. This would be a great act of virtue."</p>

<p>In the area of Xietu Road and Rue Lupan in the Shanghai South District, a male corpse, approximately thirty years old, covered in blood and with knife wounds, was discovered yesterday morning. The scene was extremely gruesome. The knife wound on the neck severed the trachea and esophagus. Only the skin on the back of the neck remained, causing the head to lean to one side. Someone noticed and reported it to the local police station, which ordered Gu Zhonglian, the head of the Seventh District, to investigate. Because no family members came forward to identify the body, it was submitted to the local court for examination. Inspector Tang was appointed to the scene, along with the examiner, to examine the body. The body was wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants. There were a total of seven or eight knife wounds on the chest, abdomen, and neck. It was determined that the victim was repeatedly slashed while alive, resulting in death. Photos were taken, and a murder weapon was recovered beside the body and brought back for evidence. The head of the district was ordered to provide a coffin and bury the body, and to investigate and find the family members for identification, while also investigating the murderer.</p>

<p>Shanghai merchant Wang Qinbo, in view of the drought in the interior, where rivers have dried up and cotton and rice crops have been devastated, with no hope for the autumn harvest, recently investigated Luodian Town in Baoshan County and Changshu and other places, which are similarly affected by the drought. The local people are pumping water from outside rivers to irrigate their fields, with excellent results. Therefore, he has prepared a water pumping plan and commissioned Mr. Li Songfu to take a letter to Nanhui on the 12th, presenting it to County Magistrate Yuan and requesting that he immediately convene an emergency meeting of the leaders of various agencies to build dikes at each port and use machines to pump water from the Huangpu River to alleviate the drought.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Recent News from the Nanshi Rent Reduction Association: An 85% Solution Achieved in the Middle Section of Minkuo Road; Zhaofang Lane on Fangbang Road Also Resolved with an 85% Reduction <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee of Shanghai, since its establishment in Yongqing Lane on Minkuo Road, has been working for rent reduction for all shops and residents in the district through reasonable and lawful measures. Over twenty cases have been resolved successively, depending on the urgency of the matter and the order of negotiation. No fewer than six thousand households, including both direct subtenants and indirect subtenants, have benefited from rent reduction. In the past week, letters have been received from nearly ten landlords requesting rent reduction. For example, Liu Hongxing Shop on Minkuo Road, with a monthly rent of 180 yuan, had its rent reduction approved by Xu Jiashan's agent, lawyer Gao Danhua, in more than ten cases. Resolved cases include Zhaofang Lane on Fangbang Road with an 85% reduction, Cheng Taixing in the middle section of Minkuo Road, with a monthly rent of 80 yuan, now reduced to 70 yuan, Sheng Yongfa with a monthly rent of 35 yuan, now reduced to 30 yuan, Qing Chenfeng Liu Xiangtai, etc., all with reductions of ten yuan or several yuan. The association has formally sent letters of thanks to the landlords and agent lawyers for their deep understanding of justice. It is also heard that the association, in order to help landlords and tenants overcome the critical situation in Shanghai, is widely distributing a special rent reduction publication, containing both "reason", "law" and "emotion," throughout the Nanshi District, except for the protection of landlords without the ability to act. Those outside the Nanshi District who wish to read the publication can request it without charge. For those who contribute rent reduction information, a small remuneration will be provided, and those with excellent content will be invited to be design committee members. Recently, national product advertisements have been appearing in the publication. Since no advertising fees are charged, the response has been very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Wu Xingsheng passed away in 1920 without children, leaving behind a concubine, Xu. Xingsheng's brother, the late wealthy merchant Wu Mosheng, and his wife, Bao, had a son named Guoliang. After Mei Mosheng passed away the year before last, he was able to inherit the estate because he had adopted Wu Futang, a shareholder of Ruikang Paint Store, before his death. Recently, Wu Xu suddenly claimed to be Xingsheng's wife and filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court Civil Division against Wu Bao, claiming that she was discriminated against by her sister-in-law Bao, and occupied ancestral property. Zhang Shizhao and other lawyers filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court Civil Division against Wu Bao. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing. According to the plaintiff Wu Xu, Bao has recently been harboring discriminatory intentions and attempting to embezzle approximately 2 million yuan of ancestral property. She requested that half of it be analyzed and returned to her for management. The defendant also hired three lawyers, Xue Dubi, Chen Ying, and Tang Yan, to represent her in court. They stated that with regards to the case, before investigating whether there was any ancestral property that had not been divided, there were several preliminary questions: 1) The plaintiff was Xingsheng's concubine, and there was a contract of sale that could prove this. She had no standing to bring a claim. 2) If she claimed to be a wife, then since she had no children and had not adopted an heir, she also had no qualification to bring a claim. 3) Xingsheng did not make this claim for property division while he was alive. Fourteen years have passed since his death. Regardless of whether the plaintiff is qualified or not, her right to claim has long expired due to the statute of limitations. She has no grounds to bring a claim. It is obviously due to being fooled by others and making unreasonable accusations. Her suit should be dismissed. Judge Shen Hong ruled that the case would be continued on the morning of the 24th for further hearing.</p>

<p>Zhong Qiuqing, a 30-year-old man from Taizhou, resides at No. 71 Garbage Pond, Yangjiadu, Pudong. He works as a boatman. The day before yesterday, he came to Shanghai from Pudong on business. At 10:10 PM, while walking through Ankang Lane, Feng Lane, Laoximen, he was stabbed by four thugs for no apparent reason. His head, left waist, back, and shoulder were stabbed with sharp knives, a total of five wounds. He was bleeding profusely and lying on the roadside. Zhang Yuming, a policeman from the Caojiaqiao No. 28 post of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found out and reported to Station Chief Tang Jinghuan, who immediately summoned an ambulance from the West District Fire Brigade to send the injured person to St. Luke's Hospital for treatment. It is said that he lost too much blood, the injury to his waist was the most serious, and because of the hot weather, his life was in danger. It is heard that Zhong had an argument with someone while drinking at the Guandi Temple in Ximen a few days ago, which led to a fight. Therefore, this sudden assassination is not unrelated.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Liu Zixiang Sues for Cohabitation with Husband; They Have Known Each Other for Seventeen Years <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zixiang, a 48-year-old woman from Ninghai, Ningbo, met Zhao Honglai, a fellow villager, in 1920 and cohabited with him at No. 27 Macao Road, Gordon Road. They have two sons, the elder being ten years old and the younger being six years old. Initially, their relationship was good, but recently, Zhao Honglai became acquainted with another woman named A Huo and discarded Liu as if she were worn-out shoes. He also stopped providing living expenses. Recently, Zhao became seriously ill, and Liu led her sons to visit him, urging him to return home to recuperate. Unexpectedly, Zhao and A Huo threw them out. Liu then filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court requesting cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiao Songxuan opened the Civil Division 7 court for the hearing. According to Liu Zixiang, she formally married Zhao at the age of 31 and has been married for seventeen years. They have two sons, who have been included in Zhao's family tree. Now that Zhao has another affair, he has taken back the red wedding certificate. She now requests that Zhao return home to cohabit. Zhao claimed that Liu was his mistress, not his formal wife. She originally had a husband named Zhou Changlin, who died in 1926. He then became acquainted with her. Her ten-year-old son was not his biological son, but the six-year-old son was his biological son. The plaintiff's son from her previous husband is now 24 years old and already married, and her daughter has also grown up. Moreover, the plaintiff and her former husband share a tomb, so it is impossible for him to cohabit with her again. The plaintiff's lawyer presented two letters from the defendant's agent lawyer, proving the plaintiff's status and the date of her former husband's death, stating that since the defendant admitted this previously, how can he deny it today? Moreover, since the ten-year-old son is not his biological son, how can he be included in the Zhao family tree? This is enough to prove that the defendant's claims are completely untrue. The court ruled that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin, and then adjourned the court to schedule a sentencing date.</p>

<p>Chuan Jinhai, a worker at the Yifeng Lathe Company in Linjialin Bridge, Yangjing, Pudong, had a feud with his colleague Yin Pinfang over a minor matter. Around 5 PM on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the company was closing, and the workers were leaving the factory. Chuan Jinhai arranged for his master, Zhang Fengxiang (also known as "Old Man"), a local hoodlum from the Eighteen Room area of Yangjing, to gather many people and wait on the main road. As soon as Tong Pinfang arrived, they rushed up and surrounded Tong, beating him. Most of them were armed with weapons such as iron rods and sharp blades, as if facing a major enemy. Dong Wansong, a member of the Eastern Security Team of the Third Team, and team members Yu Xujie and Xu Qinglin, saw that there were many people and feared a major disaster, so they stepped forward to stop them. They refused to obey and were instead beaten. Zha Jinsheng, an account room tenant of Shengshengji in Linjia Wooden Bridge, who happened to be passing by, was also hit on the right leg and waist with an iron rod. Someone reported the incident to the Second Sub-station of the Third District by telephone, and a large number of uniformed police officers were dispatched to the scene. The thugs fled in all directions. Only Chuan Jinhai and Zhang Fengxiang were caught, along with the injured Zha Jinsheng, Tong Pinfang, Dong Wansong, Yu Xujie, and Xu Qinglin, and taken to the station. According to Chuan Jinhai, he is 24 years old and from Zhenjiang. Zhang Fengxiang is 50 years old and from Tianjin. The others gave evasive answers. Since the case involved gathering a crowd to cause harm, the relevant individuals were transferred to the local court for investigation yesterday with a written report.</p>

The center of the first hurricane moved to within 120 miles of the intersection of 26 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, moving northeast. The wind force was unknown. The center of the second hurricane moved to within 60 miles of the intersection of 23 degrees 30 north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, moving north-northeast. The wind force was unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 101.3 and the lowest was 79.9. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 97.5 and the lowest was 76.1.</p>

<p>Answer to Luo Shudu, Zhu Qitong, and Fang Bingru Three Gentlemen The scientific view of practice is completely opposite to it. It is against merely "grasping that fleeting moment," it does not blindly submit to individual facts. It does not exaggerate the current reality, it deeply discerns the entire development of reality, never forgetting its ultimate purpose, it uses the facts of real human contradictions to</p>
<p>understand the most practical content of practice.</p>
<p>Below, we will use examples to explain the above abstract explanation.</p>
<p>For example, before the Xinhai Revolution, many people who were dissatisfied with the Qing Dynasty's rule only dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. At that time, when they read Mr. Sun Yat-sen's talk about revolution, they thought it was a crazy delusion, an impossible fantasy. What we saw was only the surface authority of the Qing Dynasty's rule, we did not see the revolutionary forces hidden in the society. Some of them completely succumbed to the facts at the time, not even daring to think about it, and some compromised with the rulers, advocating some kind of enlightened autocracy to justify themselves. This was their understanding of practice.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen was different. He was able to discern the entire development of the Chinese national revolution. He did not covet the small gains of the moment and cooperate with the Qing government, he did not ignore the ultimate goal. Therefore, his view of practice was scientific.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of a shop clerk apprentice reading books! What attitude do most shop clerk apprentices have towards reading now? As far as we know, some people are looking for entertainment, some people want to climb up, and another part has another kind of determination to understand reality. For their personal real life, the first type of person only sees the dark side and exaggerates the darkness too much. The second type of person only sees a little elusive benefit at the moment and becomes vulgarized. The third type of person can see further. As a result, the books read by the former type of person naturally cannot be separated from a few rotten novels that talk about love and ghosts, and the second type of person buries himself in practicing writing, calculating accounts, and copying model letters. The third type of person is different, they demand to read social science or progressive literature books, they demand to understand society. The first and second types of people only see the individual facts that are pressing on their heads in their view of practice. On the one hand, they are perfunctory and degenerate, and on the other hand, they want to rely on increasing their skills to overcome the inevitable panic of unemployment. In short, they all want to live in peace and security for a while under the maintenance of reality. They have not seen the changes in the entire social practice, and they have forgotten the ultimate goal. The third type of person is different, because their understanding of practice is different. They know that learning the first type will degenerate, it is not the path that a positive person should take, and they cannot be like the second type of person, closing their eyes and trying to use the individual to overcome this inevitable huge force (such as unemployment) in the current situation. Their view of practice does not start from personal interests. They know that in the current situation, the fate of people like shop clerk apprentices is the fate of the entire Chinese society. The practice of the individual and the practice of the entire society are integrated into one. Therefore, as an apprentice, he should of course learn skills, but the most important thing is how to be a person. Skills cannot forget the ultimate goal. Otherwise, you will only become a loyal worker in the capital's staff headquarters, playing a role that is contrary to social evolution. Moreover, you will not climb up, and your chances of climbing up will become less and less every day. You will still inevitably be abandoned to the hunger line.</p>
<p>Under this interpretation, the view of practice is the standard of truth. The pragmatism of the Japanese financial magnates and militarists does not become the view of practice of the Japanese masses. It is not the standard of truth, and truth will not lose its standard because of these self-interestism. I think, by drawing inferences from one instance, you may have a considerable concept of the scientific view of practice?</p>

<p>Educational News The Ministry of Education Instructs Specialists Above the Beiping Level</p>
<h3 id="e210">Key Points for Improvement in Various Schools (1) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>This year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to various places to inspect more than 40 public and private colleges and universities, and the inspectors have separately prepared reports and submitted them to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has carefully reviewed each one, and has proposed key points for improvement and ordered the schools to comply with them. The instructions to each school are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e211">National Peiping University <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The school's management, though some colleges have been relatively diligent in recent years, still has many areas needing improvement due to deeply rooted problems. Here are some key points for immediate and thorough rectification to achieve improvement:</p>
<p>(1) Improve the Organization: The school's organization is notably scattered. The President's Office is almost a mere formality, with each college acting independently, hindering cooperation and the progress of school affairs. Hereafter, student registration, faculty and staff appointments, budget preparation, and final accounts should be centrally managed by the President's Office. The organizational charter should be revised and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The President's Office should be relocated to the Law College.</p>
<p>(2) Reallocate Funding: The allocation of funds among the colleges is very unreasonable. The school should follow the standards outlined in Article 10 of the University Regulations, and consider the performance and actual needs of each college to reallocate funds and submit the proposal to the Ministry for approval. Furthermore, the school's budget allocates only 8.9% to equipment expenses, and actual expenditures often fall short, causing equipment in each college to be makeshift and inadequate. Office expenses account for 16%, greatly exceeding the Ministry's standard. Henceforth, the school's budget should allocate no less than 25% to equipment expenses, and rigorously reduce office expenses and salaries to supplement equipment funding.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganize Colleges and Departments: (1) The College of Commerce should merge with the College of Law to form the College of Law and Commerce, located at the original College of Law site. The original College of Commerce site should be designated for other uses upon approval. Starting in the 23rd academic year, the College of Law and Commerce should establish a Department of Commerce, with Russian as a required course, to cultivate commercial talents for the border regions. Existing students from the original College of Commerce, except those in Law, Political Science, and Economics, should be properly integrated into corresponding classes of the original College of Law. The school can decide whether to integrate or continue classes for students in International Trade, Business Administration, and Transportation Management, to allow them to complete their studies. These three departments should not enroll new students, to eventually close them down. (2) Class Four of Group B in the College of Law should be merged into Group A, and a Russian language course should be offered as an elective. As the number of students currently enrolled in this course is small, combined teaching is permissible. (3) The departments of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences were ordered to be abolished last year, but the college has not implemented this effectively, which is unacceptable. In the next academic year, the order should be thoroughly implemented, without using departmental division as a disguise. Whether the English Department should be established independently can be decided by the school and submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(4) Enforce Full-Time Employment for Faculty and Staff: Many faculty members in the school are part-time, and even full-time faculty often hold positions at other schools. There are many staff positions, but few are truly dedicated. The total number of faculty and staff is 868, exceeding half the student population. Hereafter, deans and department heads must not hold teaching or administrative positions elsewhere. Those holding concurrent teaching positions within the school should not receive additional pay. Professors teaching at other schools should be strictly limited. Faculty and staff salaries should be fairly determined based on their academic qualifications, experience, and responsibilities. Faculty should primarily be full-time, and the number of existing staff should be reduced.</p>
<p>(5) Address Faculty Absences and Student Absenteeism: Faculty absences and student absenteeism have become habitual, with late arrivals and early departures being commonplace. While some colleges have attempted to rectify this, deeply ingrained habits make significant improvements difficult. The school should implement strict measures and enforce them rigorously.</p>
<p>In addition to the above five points, here are some special points for improvement in each college:</p>
<p>(1) Women's College of Arts and Sciences: Faculty and staff salaries account for 86% of the college's expenses, which is unacceptable. The accounting is exceptionally complex, with a deficit of over 4,000 yuan from September of last year to January of this year. Salaries should be reduced as much as possible, and accounting should be reorganized to balance income and expenses. Science equipment is very simple, and experiments lack dedicated professors for guidance. Very little is spent on purchasing books, and physical education equipment is lacking. Equipment expenses should be increased and improvements made. The college has 149 faculty and staff, almost half the student population. Many also hold positions outside the college. The number of staff should be reduced and outside employment restricted. The college's curriculum is often designed for specific individuals, lacking a coherent focus. It should be carefully re-established. Dormitory order is seldom supervised by responsible personnel. There are no accurate statistics in course schedules. Students absent for more than one-third of the semester were allowed to take the final exams, and those who failed the final exams were allowed to register for classes.</p>
<p>This shows a lack of seriousness toward training and academics. Improvements should be made.</p>
<p>(2) College of Medicine: The college's operations are relatively on track. However, basic course equipment and common chemistry laboratory materials and equipment are extremely lacking. There is no physics laboratory or equipment. The equipment in the affiliated hospital is insufficient for student practice and should be supplemented. Research laboratories in each department should be developed equally. Basic subjects similar to pre-medical courses should be emphasized in the early grades. The variety of foreign languages is too numerous and should be reduced. There are too many part-time lecturers. The affiliated hospital is small, but there are 93 staff members, which is too many, and should be reduced. Faculty should be hired based on talent, not on whether they are from the college.</p>
<p>(3) College of Agriculture: The college has too many expenditure items, resulting in monthly deficits. Expenses should be reduced to compensate. A library should be built, and important Western journals and new publications should be added. The courses in each department are too detailed and should be reorganized to reduce unnecessary subjects and focus on basic training. The college lacks a physics laboratory and equipment. The subject and experiments should be required or elective courses for first-year students in each department, so that students have a sufficient understanding of this basic subject. It is also inappropriate that there are no experiments for organic chemistry and theoretical chemistry. There are few full-time professors, and they often arbitrarily cancel classes due to outside employment, causing students to follow suit and be absent, which should be strictly corrected.</p>
<p>(4) College of Engineering: Most of the college's equipment is old. Although it is barely sufficient, the equipment for heat engine experiments and physics laboratory instruments is very simple. There are few books, especially complete sets of journals, which need to be added and supplemented. Expenses such as student field trips and work-study subsidies are often inappropriate and should be reduced and used to supplement equipment. The number of courses in each department should be reduced if they are unnecessary. There are too many teaching assistants (19), and they lack performance. They should be reduced. In addition, there are fewer full-time professors than part-time professors, and many full-time professors teach outside the college. There are too many staff members, and too few are responsible. Improvements should be made.</p>
<p>(5) College of Law: Although the college has attempted to make improvements in recent years, there are many excessive administrative expenses that should be reduced as much as possible. The course guidelines are too simple and should be re-established and explained in detail. There are too many course hours. Unnecessary ones should be reduced, and research should be emphasized to allow for further study. Among the 89 faculty members, only 16 are full-time, and many full-time professors still hold positions elsewhere, which is inappropriate. Qualified full-time professors should be hired and not allowed to hold outside positions. The number of staff members should also be reduced.</p>
<p>(6) College of Commerce: Faculty and staff salaries account for 87% of the college's expenses, with a monthly deficit of 1,000 yuan, which is covered by borrowing, which is inappropriate. There are few full-time faculty members, and there are many canceled classes. Many students withdrew from school last semester, and absenteeism is still prevalent. There are also too many staff members. After the college merges with the College of Law next semester, the original College of Commerce's expenses should be properly allocated by the school and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The academic affairs should be thoroughly reorganized by the College of Law and Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e212">National Peking University <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the school has made many improvements to its operations, such as reorganizing colleges and departments, hiring more full-time professors, adding books and instruments, and being more serious about checking attendance and evaluating grades. These are all achievements. The academic atmosphere of the College of Science is particularly improved, which is commendable. However, the following points still need attention:</p>
<p>(1) The school has too many staff members. Some departments have more than 20 faculty members. Salary and office expenses are too high. The number of faculty and staff should be reduced to save costs. The school's budget and external subsidies are quite large. If all wasteful expenditures are reduced, there should be a considerable surplus each year to be used for building some school buildings.</p>
<p>(2) Although the school has increased the number of full-time faculty members, there are still too many part-time faculty members. The full-time system should be enforced and the number of part-time personnel reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Some full-time faculty members still teach outside the school. This should be further restricted and strictly enforced. According to reports, important staff members such as deans, department heads, and academic affairs directors receive very generous salaries. They should be absolutely prohibited from holding outside positions or teaching classes. Professors and staff members in each college who hold concurrent teaching or administrative positions within the school should not receive additional pay.</p>
<p>(4) The College of Arts has more students than other colleges. Enrollment should be reduced in the future. The departments in the college should also be reduced.</p>
<p>(5) The school's current student dormitory management should be improved and attention should be paid to training.</p>
<p>(6) If the Graduate School continues to operate, it should follow the Ministry's recently promulgated Provisional Organizational Regulations for University Graduate Schools, reduce the scope, and submit a detailed plan to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>The above points are very important and should be thoroughly implemented to improve administrative efficiency and strive for the consolidation and development of the entire school's foundation.</p>

<p>Methods for make-up exams and rewards have been decided. Results seem to be better than in the previous two years. The Shanghai Education Bureau's graduation exam for middle school students will be announced tomorrow. The announcement from the bureau is below:</p>
<h3 id="e214">Meeting of the Examination Committee Concluded <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The Middle School Graduation Examination Committee of the Municipal Education Bureau has been established and organized by appointed committee members to prepare for the examination. Several committee meetings have been held to discuss and implement various important matters. The committee held a concluding meeting the other day. The important resolutions of the meeting are recorded below: (1) Candidates for the second semester graduation examination of the 21st year who did not finish the examination due to certain reasons were previously allowed to continue the examination. In the past, many of those who took the examination have already reported to participate. This should be terminated in the future. (2) Candidates for this year's graduation examination who did not finish the examination due to certain reasons, if all subjects have passed or one or two subjects have failed, are allowed to take special make-up exams and tutoring. (3) The reward method is revised: (A) Student Section: 1. Those who rank in the top three in the total score of each subject with A grades will be awarded a bonus and a scholarship certificate. 2. Those whose total score of each subject is B or above and rank A will be awarded a prize.

<p>The third middle school student graduation examination in this city has been completed. Prior to the examination, in late May, this bureau, based on the Ministry's regulations for the middle school student graduation examination and the regulations of the Middle School Student Graduation Examination Committee, appointed 12 committee members, and the director of the bureau served as the chairman of the committee to organize the Shanghai Third Middle School Student Graduation Examination Committee. A meeting was convened to revise the Shanghai Education Bureau's Middle School Student Graduation Examination Regulations for the second semester of the 22nd year and the Shanghai Education Bureau's Middle School Student Graduation Examination Committee Rules of Procedure, which were submitted to the 285th bureau affairs meeting for amendment and passed, and were respectively approved by the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government for filing and implementation. The committee also discussed the formulation of regulations, the determination of the examination period, the allocation of examination venues, the appointment of question-setting committee members, and other matters, and proceeded with them one by one according to the resolutions. Twenty question-setting committee members were also convened to discuss the standards, methods, and marking of examination papers in detail, and clear regulations were made. Because the examination was complicated and important, in addition to the chairman presiding over everything, three standing committee members were designated to handle daily affairs, one committee member was designated as the director-general, and 44 bureau members were assigned as secretaries to set up an office divided into four groups: document affairs, management, and grade registration, and to prepare a procedure for the examination, which began work on June 11 and actively prepared.</p>
<p>There were ten high school examination venues and eleven junior high school examination venues. The examination venue area was estimated and the number of candidates was allocated. In order to facilitate the candidates' travel, the examination venues were allocated in the east, west, north, and south districts, which was more than before. June 25, 26, and 27 were the examination dates. The high school examination on the first day was for foreign language, history, and biology; the second day was for mathematics, geography, and chemistry; and the third day was for Chinese, party training, and physics. The junior high school examination on the first day was for foreign language, history and geography, and biology; the second day was for mathematics, physical chemistry, and party principles; and the third day was for Chinese. During the examination, committee members of the examination committee served as chief examiners and were responsible for presiding over the examination venues. Seventy people who were unrelated to the examination schools were sent to serve as supervisors and were assigned to each examination venue as supervisors to assist in the process.</p>
<p>There were 52 high schools and 72 junior high schools participating in the examination. The number of students participating in the examination was 1409 in high school and 2147 in junior high school. There were 65 high school and 18 junior high school students taking make-up exams. All examination papers were marked and graded starting on the 26th at the Guizhou Road Lake Society. The work was completed on July 4, and the results were sorted, registered, calculated, copied, and verified. A total of 1409 people participated in this high school examination, and 948 passed and were allowed to graduate, accounting for 67.1%. A total of 2147 people participated in this junior high school examination, and 1612 passed and were allowed to graduate, accounting for 75.1%. According to statistics, the results of this year's examination seem to be better than in the previous two years, indicating that schools have gradually been able to pay attention to teaching effectiveness. Therefore, the reward standards have also been raised, as detailed in the examination methods. Other statistics will be published in "Great Shanghai Education" in the future, following the methods of the previous two years.</p>
<p>National Vocational Education Society Conference</p>
<h3 id="e216">Opened in Gan Yesterday Morning <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang sent someone to give instructions (Nanchang, 13th) The 12th National Vocational Education Society Conference was held at the Gan Education Bureau at 9:00. Huang Yanpei and 357 members from Jilin, Suiyuan and five cities including Shanghai attended the conference. Jiang Wenyu chaired the meeting. As Chiang was in Lushan, Wen Qun was sent to read out his instructions. He pointed out that vocational education can reduce education and the creation of high-level idlers. The country does not suffer from a lack of employment, but from a lack of loyalty to one's duty and a sense of responsibility. It does not suffer from insufficient skills to match one's profession, but from a lack of ambition to improve. He hoped that the spirit of the New Life Movement could be incorporated into vocational education. There were 47 proposals, which were divided into four groups: educational administration, remedial education, rural improvement, and vocational courses, for review. After the meeting, they will visit the bandit system in Lushan.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that all primary and secondary school students in the city receive scout training, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated a five-year plan and is promoting it. During this year's summer vacation, the Shanghai Scout Council has entrusted the East Asia Sports College to open a summer school with a quota of 100 students. All physical education teachers in the city's schools can register for free admission to practice. Those who do not enroll for training will not be able to serve as scout instructors in the next academic year. As for the schools in this city that will form scout groups in the next semester, the Scout Council has decided that all city private middle schools and municipal primary schools with more than eight classrooms must form scout groups. Private primary schools will decide whether to hold the groups based on the economic situation of each school.</p>
<p>China Statistical Society</p>
<h3 id="e220">Held the Fourth Annual Meeting in Shanghai <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held yesterday, chaired by Wang Zhongwu, the president of the society. Five groups held a joint banquet at the New Asia Restaurant this afternoon. The fourth annual meeting of the China Statistical Society was held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao starting yesterday. The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. At 7:00 p.m., the International Trade Bureau and the National Tariff Commission held a public banquet for all members on the ninth floor of the YMCA. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e221">Members Present Included Wang Zhongwu, Sheng Zhuozhi, Liu Da <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>

<p>Zhonghu. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that the society was holding its fourth annual meeting in Shanghai today, and he commended all the members for their enthusiastic participation in the hot weather. The China Statistical Society was established four years ago. Although the history is short, the achievements have been practical. Some of the members of the society are specialized in the research of statistical academics, and some are engaged in statistical operations. In recent years, the members of the society have made significant contributions to the research of labor problems, economic problems, price problems, etc. When the central government discussed statistical laws and regulations, it solicited opinions from the society, and most of them adopted our proposals. In the future, the central government will also seek the society's technical assistance for the national census. Therefore, the society can effectively communicate the cause and academia and strive for practicality instead of empty talk. This achievement is due to the efforts of the members. In the future, we should continue to redouble our efforts to make the social affairs more developed so that the society and the country can rely on statistical methods and data to solve and improve the situation, etc. Then, Sheng Zhuozhi, chairman of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations and dispersed.</p>

<p>The deadline is the 21st of this month. Those who have not been exempted should enroll. The Municipal Education Bureau previously ordered the National Jiaotong University and the Private Datong University to jointly organize the summer training class for science teachers in middle schools in this city. The preparations have been completed. The registration period has been extended by one week. Those who have not been exempted from attending should enroll on time. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e226">Extended Enrollment The Municipal Education Bulletin says, "The bureau <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Previously ordered the National Jiaotong University and the Private Datong University in this city to jointly organize the summer training class for science teachers in middle schools in this city, and the outline has been set and announced with a deadline for registration. However, it has been found that most of the science teachers in each school have returned home for the holidays and have not been able to come to Shanghai in person to register, and have requested an extension of the registration period. In order to take into account the actual difficulties of the teachers, the bureau has approved the extension of the registration date for one week (until July 21) to facilitate the teachers from afar to come to handle the registration matters on time. If the deadline has passed and the science teachers of public and private middle schools in this city (except those who have been approved by the bureau for exemption from attending) still refuse to comply, they will not be rehired in the next semester."</p>

Those who have not been approved by the bureau for exemption from attending will not be rehired in the next semester to emphasize the importance of the law. It is reported that the Private Daxia University Affiliated Daxia Middle School sent the resumes of five science teachers, including Gu Wenzao, Zang Weiying, Wang Houyou, Wang Hanzhong, and Zeng Guangdian, and requested the bureau to exempt them from attending. Only one person, Wang Houyou, was exempted from attending because he was a part-time lecturer at the university. The remaining members were still ordered by the Education Bureau to register and enroll in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Chapter 2: Application of Foot Weight and Gaze <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The Minor Details Misunderstood and Neglected by Ordinary People Are the Basic Principles of the Game.</p>
<p>The way to grip the racket has been described in the previous chapter. As for the application of feet, legs, body, and gaze, beginners often overlook them, thinking they are easy. However, the rules for these applications are the basic principles of the game, which are the solid foundation for future success in the game. Therefore, we should study them in detail.</p>
<p>Even famous netball players often have improper foot and body positions, so they sometimes make mistakes. It is not that they do not know that this is the most taboo thing when hitting the ball. The reason for deliberately doing so is entirely due to the bad habits they developed during their previous learning. The proper function of the feet is to use the empty time before the opponent's incoming ball arrives to calmly place the feet in the appropriate position. Sometimes, in fierce competition, the opponent deliberately hits the ball to a distant place on the court, forcing you to run to deal with it. Even famous players cannot avoid this kind of forced running. However, in any case, running to meet the ball is not the best way.</p>
<p>Before hitting the incoming ball, the player must have time to plant his feet firmly on the ground. The most appropriate position is mostly to have both feet parallel to the flight path of the ball, and then use the weight of the body to increase the swinging force in the same direction as the hit. Some clever players completely disregard the position of the feet, but this is an exception and should not be imitated by beginners.</p>
<p>There are three benefits to having both feet parallel to the flight of the ball: First, it gives the arm great freedom of movement when hitting the ball. Second, with both feet firmly planted on the ground, the weight of the body can increase the force of the hit by using "follow-through" (FOLLWTHTONGH). Third, the player can move forward and backward freely without feeling any difficulty, which is much more convenient than having both feet in line with the ball.</p>
<p>When resting and waiting for the opponent to serve or return the ball, the position of the feet at this time should be oblique to the ball or the flight path of the ball, because there is a need to move the position. This method allows for unrestricted movement forward, backward, left, and right. However, when actually hitting the ball, it is best to have both feet parallel to the flight path of the ball.</p>
<p>The distance between the feet, one in front of the other, should be appropriate, not too narrow, so that the movement of the arms can have a solid foundation and the follow-through force will not lose its balance. As for how far apart the feet should be, it depends on the length of the player's feet and the strength of the follow-through force used when hitting the ball. The usual distance is two feet. If it is too wide, it will hinder the movement of the feet after hitting the ball. If it is too narrow, it will limit the power of the hit. Not only should the feet be separated and stable, but also at all times, the toes should be used to stand, and the heels should not be placed on the ground, because when the incoming ball is slightly higher or slightly lower than you expected, you need to be able to respond freely with your toes off the ground. Moreover, even famous netball players cannot always avoid this inaccurate prediction. When preparing for the next return, standing on the toes is much faster to move than standing on the heels. "Standing on the toes" is the secret of all sports, and it is even more important in netball.</p>

<h3 id="e240">New Air Battery <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>Since Volla invented the battery in 1800, it has been more than a hundred years. The changes and improvements have been made more than once, and the applications have been increasing day by day. Its application in radio is also widespread, especially in our country where alternating current has not yet been popularized, so sales are quite good.</p>
<p>Batteries used to be divided into two types: dry batteries and storage batteries. The former has a short lifespan and uneven output voltage, and vacuum tubes are easily damaged. The latter has a longer lifespan, but it is inconvenient to charge. Therefore, a new type of air battery has been invented.</p>
<p>The air battery is shaped like a storage battery, but its structure is slightly the same as a dry battery. However, the carbon is a special carbon strip that can absorb air. The oxygen it absorbs becomes clean water after neutralizing the light gas that is close to the electrode reaction. Therefore, from beginning to end, the voltage change is minimal, from about 2.2 volts to 1.9 volts. If so, the vacuum tube is not easily damaged, and the lifespan is very long, which is far from ordinary dry batteries or storage batteries. The storage battery can only be used for up to 100 hours, while the air battery can last for more than 1,200 hours. The above are its advantages. The voltage of the air battery is 2 volts, the current is 600 amps, and the maximum load current is 0.75 amps. If it is slightly larger, the battery will be damaged instantly, so pay attention to it.</p>
<p>This battery is designed based on power-saving vacuum tubes, such as , etc. Now there is a single-tube machine, the detection is number , and the filament current is 0.06 amps. Then 600 + 06 = 10,000 hours. If you listen for 5 hours a day, it can be used for 2,000 days, about 5 years. This battery is sealed very tightly and will never be affected by moisture and consume power. Therefore, no matter how long it is left, it is exactly the same as a new one. There are also several vacuum tubes mentioned above, which can be calculated according to the following formula.</p>
<p>600A = hours / (how many hours each tube filament total current is turned on per day)</p>
<p>= ·····days + 365 = ····years</p>
<h3 id="e241">Selectivity Issues (Continued) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>(3) Branch line key system This is a better method. Using a branch line key to change the self-inductance of the matching coil, and at the same time using a smaller-capacity variable capacitor to find the matching radio station, it can be more evenly distributed on the scale. As for the matching with the antenna, there are two methods: one is magnetic induction coupling, as shown in the first diagram. The earth wire loop also uses a branch line key, and a regulated meter is also used between the primary and secondary stages. This design is suitable for short antennas or receiving radio stations with longer wavelengths. The second is direct capacitive coupling, as shown in the second diagram. The capacitor connected in series under the antenna must have a capacity of less than 50 trillionths of a farad. This circuit is quite suitable for long antennas or receiving radio stations with shorter wavelengths.</p>
<p>B. Construction Discussion</p>
<p>The superiority of selectivity is related to the success or failure of the circuit. Whether the structure is appropriate or not is even more important. Whenever we construct a machine, the problem of unclear separation below 50 degrees on the dial (that is, radio stations with short wavelengths) is always more serious than those above 50 degrees. It is not the circuit that is bad, but the shortcomings in the structure.</p>
<p>The composition of the tuning circuit is a variable capacitor and a coil. Usually, amateur users design and wind the coil themselves, and the variable capacitor is mostly sold by the manufacturer. At the same time, the tuning circuit is also affected by the bypass capacitor, mast control ring, and wiring in the entire circuit. In short, the tuning at short wavelengths is often not sensitive, which is the result of the potential capacitance created by the above-mentioned factors.</p>
<p>(1) Variable capacitor: Most domestic products are linear capacitance theory or linear length. Therefore, the tuning of short wavelengths is often not sharp. If the straight line frequency and folding type manufactured by P and other manufacturers, the distribution of radio stations can be slightly uniform. However, based on my personal experience, I know that the relationship between selectivity and this point is still shallow, and its relationship with the minimum capacitance of the variable capacitor is quite large. Generally, people think that the selectivity is not good when using a 500 trillionths of a farad capacitor, and it can be better with a smaller capacity capacitor such as 350 trillionths of a farad. This view is actually wrong, because the minimum capacitance of the two capacitors is similar. For domestic capacitors with a capacity above 30 trillionths of a farad, the minimum capacitance is around 20 to 25 trillionths of a farad. Well-designed imported products are mostly between 20 and 12 trillionths of a farad. The difference is still limited. I think that for the variable capacitor used in the broadcast section, domestic products can be used as much as possible, and its larger size achieves economic purposes. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e242">Pay Attention to the Screen Circuit of the Output Pentode <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Because the pentode can obtain a very large output with a very small amount of input, almost all new radios use it for the final stage low frequency amplification. The screen grid voltage of ordinary vacuum tubes is lower than the screen voltage.) For example, when the screen voltage of the -24 tube is 25OV, the screen grid voltage is only 90V. When the screen voltage of the 57 tube is 250V, the screen grid voltage is only 100V.) However, the screen grid voltage of low frequency output pentodes (such as 3347 and 2A5, etc.) is equal to its screen voltage. When using this type of vacuum tube, if you forget to connect the speaker or output transformer, the screen grid will immediately turn red. If the time is slightly longer, the vacuum tube may burn out. Therefore:</p>
<p>When using an output pentode, if the screen circuit is not connected, do not open it casually.</p>
<h3 id="e243">A Little Knowledge of Super Selective Filters <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>With the establishment of numerous radio stations, the smaller the difference in transmission frequency, the more difficult it is to receive radio signals. Radios that do not use heterodyne circuits cannot avoid group wave interference. However, if a super selective filter is added to the radio's radio frequency input, it will have a very effective effect.</p>
<p>The diagram shows the super selective filter circuit, which is connected to the radio's radio frequency amplification stage. The AB two coils use a coil, use 24 double-strand wrapped wire to wind 35 turns each in the same direction on a 2.5-inch diameter bakelite cylinder. The distance between the AB two coils is 2 inches. The capacity of capacitor C is 100 farads, or a 35-piece type; the old 45-piece type is even better.</p>
<p>The effective selective frequency of this filter is from 700 to 1,510 cycles. When adjusting, first move the radio capacitor dial to the frequency of a certain radio station you want to receive, and then slowly adjust the filter capacitor C until the input signal reaches a maximum intensity point.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Remedies for Atmospheric Interference <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— You Lan</p>
<p>The atmospheric interference during summer radio reception is the most annoying thing. The more sophisticated the radio, the more noise it has. The causes of atmospheric interference vary. It is mostly due to changes in the atmospheric potential or electrostatic discharge such as lightning in the sky near the receiving end, which indirectly or directly induces the antenna to generate forced oscillations and produce extremely irregular noise. The sound is sometimes like a stone hitting, sometimes like insects chirping, and is very uncertain. There are many ways to avoid atmospheric interference, but few are effective. Now I will describe the remedies below for the reference of comrades. However, only one or two can be avoided, but not completely, because this is also a difficult problem to solve in radio.</p>
<p>(1) In summer, it is best to receive strong radio stations in this city, because they are powerful and sound loud, which can cover up atmospheric interference.</p>
<p>(2) Only receive radio stations in this city, because there is less atmospheric interference than receiving distant places. Also, receiving radio stations in the north is less than receiving radio stations in the south. Also, receiving radio stations in the north is better than receiving radio stations in the south. (3) The best programs to receive are Beijing opera and foreign orchestras, because their voices are loud and can make the atmospheric interference disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>(4) Placing the amplifier in the next room or staying a little further away from the radio when listening can also avoid it.</p>
<p>(5) In summer, it is better to use a short antenna for radio reception, because long antennas are more likely to receive atmospheric electricity. It is best to use an indoor antenna, because it can not only avoid atmospheric interference, but also avoid lightning strikes. (6) Using mineral stone as a detector can also avoid atmospheric interference and has a clear sound.</p>
<p>(7) Applying an underground antenna can also avoid atmospheric interference. The installation method of the underground antenna is as follows:</p>
<p>Use a large cigarette paper box, fill the box with carbon chips, and then bury two broken A batteries in the carbon chips. The two batteries are connected to each other, and a 14-gauge covered wire is connected to it as the lead-in wire of the antenna. Wrap the outside of the paper box with bare copper wire (14 gauge), lead one end of it out as a ground wire, and then bury the paper box underground. The deeper the better, but it must be at least two or three feet deep.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Pocket Two-Tube Radio <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>Economical, lightweight, simple construction, excellent performance. This machine was designed for my old friend Qianjun, who was inspired by Mr. Jiancun's article "Further Discussion on Pocket Radios" published in this journal last time.</p>
<p>The test results show that the effectiveness is excellent. The clarity of the sound quality, the loudness of the volume, the sensitivity of the selectivity, and the distance of the radio reception are comparable to ordinary four-tube machines. See circle one.</p>
<p>Because the design focuses on the "pocket" aspect, it is necessary to strive for ingenuity, smallness, and lightness in terms of volume and weight. As a result, in addition to greatly reducing the number of parts, the two-stage low-frequency amplification is also connected by resistance, which not only saves two low-frequency transformers, making the weight and volume of the whole machine lighter and smaller, but also makes the sound quality clearer and more pleasant.</p>
<p>The vacuum tubes used are the new types No. and No. 33. The characteristics and effectiveness of No. 33 have long been known to research comrades. As for No. 19, because it has only recently been launched, or there is a part of it in the same place, a brief explanation and introduction is specially added below.</p>
<p>This type is a new American Class B amplifier tube, suitable for working in DC machines. The total output power can be obtained at 2.1 watts when low-frequency amplification is performed. Its characteristics are as follows: Filament voltage: 2 volts. Filament current: 0.26 amps. Screen voltage: 1.35 volts. Screen current: 5 amps.) Each screen (</p>
<p>Although only two vacuum tubes are working in this machine, because No. 19 is composed of two triode parts inside, plus No. 33, there are actually three vacuum tubes working, plus the application of a regenerative circuit, so it has the effect of a four-tube machine. Its working situation is roughly like this:</p>
<p>Radio waves pass through the tuning circuit to the No. 19 vacuum tube. The first triode part acts as a high-frequency amplifier, the second triode part acts as a detector, and then returns to the first triode part to act as the first low-frequency amplifier, and then inputs to the No. 33 vacuum tube for final-stage strong amplification, and then the sound is emitted by the speaker. Therefore, the sound obtained is extremely clear and loud, and the selectivity is also good.</p>
<p>The electricity for this machine is supplied by batteries. The A electricity is a domestic 2-volt 25-amp storage battery, the F electricity is a small 45-volt battery, and the B electricity is connected in series on three sides.</p>
<p>Usually, in order to prevent the screen current of the low-frequency amplifier tube from being too large and easily damaging the speaker or earphone, filters are used. Because the screen current of No. 33 is as high as 14.5 amps, it is best to use it. Its installation method is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>In the figure, AFC is a low-frequency choke coil, about 30H25MA is enough. C is a disconnect capacitor with a capacity from 0.025MFD to 2MFD.</p>
<p>The coils LLLLLLC4 can be wound with a temporary diameter paper tube. LLLLLC4 can be used for a temporary diameter paper, LL each 125 turns, all wound with 32-gauge paint-colored wire, the distance between each coil is about 1-2 points. L1L2 each 125 turns, all wound with 32-gauge paint-colored wire, the distance between each coil is about 1-2 points. L3L4 are wound on the same tube, L3 15 turns, L4 125 turns, wound with 32-gauge paint-colored wire, the distance between L3 and L4 is about 4-5 points.</p>
<p>This machine can be installed in a 7*45*5 small wooden box. As for the arrangement of the parts, perhaps the smart reader is more refined than me, so I won't say more. If this machine is used to receive radio signals with earphones, it can completely dispense with the天L wire, and the sound is extremely loud. Fortunately, this machine has a volume controller, which will never damage the eardrum. If it is used to receive radio signals with a speaker, it can also dispense with the earth wire, just drag an 8-9 foot long flower wire on the grid of the first triode part of No. 19 (as shown by the dotted line in Figure 1).</p>
<p>Application of other parts:</p>
<p>(1) CC1 is a double-coupled variable capacitor for adjusting the wavelength (with a compensating capacitor), the capacity is 360MMMFD</p>
<p>(2) C2C5 is a disconnect capacitor for the low-frequency amplification section, the capacity is 0.006MFD</p>
<p>(3) C is a 0.00025MFD grid capacitor</p>
<p>(4) C4 is a 0.0005MFD branch capacitor</p>
<p>(5) C6 is a 2MFD branch capacitor, pressed across both ends of the generation B to reduce low-frequency loss,</p>
<p>(6) C7 is a 0.001MFD branch capacitor</p>
<p>(7) R is a 5,000,000 ohm tone controller</p>
<p>(8) R1 is a 100,000 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>(9) R2 is a 4MFG ohm variable resistor for the vacuum tube filament voltage</p>

<h3 id="e246">Increase Volume <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Bei</p>
<p>Ordinary amateurs always want to use some small wisdom to increase the volume of the radio. In fact, this is very convenient. Just connect a grid leak between the detection grid and the screen of the first stage low frequency amplification tube, as shown in the figure. Of course, the wiring of the grid should be as short as possible. The value of the grid leak should be at least 5 million ohms or more. If the number of ohms is small, it will produce a continuous screaming sound, which is caused by low frequency oscillation. The increased volume is really amazing. Sometimes the grid leak used for detection can even be omitted. This method is very worthwhile to try in DC machines because it can both increase the volume and save B electricity.</p>
<p>A non-tapped square canopy can also be used as a push-pull type. We often encounter that we want to make a push-pull amplification but there is no tapped square canopy. (Because the push-pull type must use a tapped square canopy.) Now there is a way to introduce to those who do not have a tapped square canopy can also be used in the push-pull type, as shown in the circle. The square canopy stage is connected to the grid of the vacuum tube. Now use two resistors connected in series in the secondary of the square canopy, and pass a ground wire between the two resistors. The number of ohms of the resistor can be from 150,000 to 500,000, but the values of the two resistors must be equal.</p>

<p>A recent message from the American Wireless Radio Company stated that the company held a massive sale last week. The business was so booming that the threshold was almost broken. The good reason is that its exclusive manager, Stewart Radio, has excellent performance and is deeply satisfied by users. The sales of this machine in the United States reach nearly a million each year, as it is cheap, beautiful, and quite durable. It is also very convenient for radio reception in the summer. The company also exclusively manages Sullivan vacuum tubes. All radios using this tube are exceptionally loud and clear.</p>
<p>Special news on radio repair: The most prominent radio repair company in this city is undoubtedly the Ada Company at 24 Nanjing Road. The company's repair department not only has the most complete instruments and parts, but also a large number of repair talents, which is its characteristic. Moreover, each person has their own expertise and is proficient in their skills. Recently, companies from other cities have often entrusted the company to hire repair technicians on their behalf, believing that the technicians recommended by the company must be outstanding in technology and have excellent performance. The newly opened Daxin Electrical Materials Company in Nanchang, Jiangxi, sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to purchase a large quantity of wireless radio materials and had Mr. Wu, a wireless radio technician, introduced by Ada Company to provide services, with a monthly salary of one hundred and eighty yuan. He has already taken the materials and set off for Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Publication of "Modern Practical Electromagnetism": This book was written by Mr. Qiu Yuefan and is distributed by the Transportation Department's Electrical Administration Public Welfare Association. It explains the latest knowledge of electromagnetism in great detail. The first volume has been published, and the contents include applied mathematics, direct current circuits, electromagnetic induction, electrochemistry, direct current motors, capacitors, electrical instruments, cathode rays, X-rays, radioactivity, quantum theory, and systems of electrical units. The price is one yuan and eight jiao per volume, with postage of five fen, and registered postage of one jiao and three fen. In addition to the Public Welfare Association, it is sold at the Life Bookstore, New Electrical World Bookstore, American Company, and Jianhua Company.</p>
<p>The Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Machine Company at 49 Nanjing Road has always been praised by all sectors for its expertise in repair. The number of radios entrusted for repair is increasing daily. All staff in the technical department are working hard on repair work, striving to provide customers with fast and reliable service, so the manufacturing of the smallest receiver in the planned project has been temporarily neglected. In the future, if anyone has a radio that is damaged and needs fast and reliable service, they can call 14996.</p>
<p>Free Insurance for Radios: Radios are often damaged by high voltage during thunderstorms in the summer, and even burn out all the vacuum tubes. The preventive measure is to install a lightning arrester between the antenna and the ground wire. Ordinary lightning arresters lose their effectiveness after being struck once. The Philips brand arrester has a vacuum tube inside and can be used hundreds of times. Even if there is only a voltage of one or two hundred volts on the antenna, it can be avoided. The outside is a glass tube with a magnetic cap on top to prevent rainwater from entering. After installation, there is no need to worry during thunderstorms. Isn't this free insurance?</p>

<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur (Kuala Lumpur) is the capital of the Federated Malay States and the transportation center of the Malay Peninsula. It has a magnificent station and complex railway lines. It stands in the center of the Malay Peninsula. The British colonial governor is stationed here, controlling the many Malay chiefs in the north and south, and also controlling many weak Eastern nations.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur is a man-made vampire, a sub-capitalist urban form. It thrives by sucking the blood of tin mines and rubber, and it is built on the blood and sweat of tin miners and rubber workers. It has clean and prosperous streets, and it once made the sound of money in the "golden age" of the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p>However, Kuala Lumpur was created by the Chinese. The guest Ye Lai once led his people to fight bloody battles here. When the British threatened the Malay Peninsula with their cannons, the Qing court allowed Ye Lai to offer this painstakingly cultivated land, (see Liang Qichao's biography of Ye Lai.) allowing the British Empire to establish its ruling agency in Malaya, while the Chinese suffered under "economic recession"! Traveling here, I can't help but sigh!</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<p>Singapore, Penang, and Malacca are considered colonies directly ruled by the British government, collectively known as the Straits Settlements. The Chinese, however, call them Lak, Yu. (Lak is an abbreviation of Pening Lak. It is also what mainlanders call Singapore.)</p>
<p>Singapore, a city of filth and sin, is called the "Paris of the Equator." Now, the muzzles of the cannons on the fort point directly at the sea; in the future, the waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans will be stirred into frantic waves, and the flag on Flagstaff Hill may change color.</p>
<p>Singapore, the clanging sound of money echoes during the day; but at night, it squeezes out the breath of flesh and the sigh of life.</p>
<p>Singapore, dust obscures the sky during the day, and the sun's heat steams on the asphalt road. From the outside, Singapore fully symbolizes the power of imperialism in the colonies.</p>
<p>Singapore is one of the world's human race expositions. This exposition is undoubtedly presided over by the British.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the essence of Singapore, you should take a look at the Governor's House and the Imperial Barracks in Singapore. You should take a look at a few warships anchored in the sea, with the Union Jack flying on the ships; or take a look at a company of infantry walking on Singapore Road, or a company of Imperial Volunteers setting out for exercises; you can see those majestic military appearances and those bright military weapons.</p>
<p>As for wanting to see the face and spirit of the South Seas from Singapore, that will definitely disappoint you. You should delve into the interior, climb into the desolate forests and paths, and then you can understand this mysterious equatorial land. Because Singapore has been imperialized, it has lost its original peaceful and tranquil face.</p>
<h3 id="e249">"Cultural Maladjustment" <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Ling</p>
<p>"The Trend of Modern Chinese Culture" has become a fashionable topic today.</p>
<p>If calculated from the Opium War era, indeed, "motion" is very intense, as for "direction," everyone has different opinions, and there is always a reason for saying it.</p>
<p>We won't say much about the movement of the common people being unable to survive, but what about the intellectuals who bear the mission of culture? After foreign guns and warships invaded, some people poked their heads out from the piles of old paper, inevitably trembling, so "Chinese learning for the essence, Western learning for application" arose. Until the New Culture Movement arose, a group of people further identified Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science as the two wheels of modern culture. At the same time, in major cities, a large number of compradors emerged, and towering chimneys also stood up. Surrounding these, there were also young men and women desperately dancing. What about the other side? The schoolmaster in the Three Family Village was teaching students to write this kind of article (see a certain provincial education publication):</p>
<p>"Those who discuss say: Only Heaven gives birth to people with desires. Without a ruler, there will be chaos. A ruler is what all people look up to and what the country relies on. Even in times of peace and tranquility, 'it' cannot be without it. How much more so in times when enemy countries are eyeing and strong neighbors are watching... " 丨丨 Discussion on the Restoration of Emperor Gaozong.</p>
<p>"...What is a Bodhisattva? Bo means universal, and Sa means saving. It is an honorable title for deities, hence the title of Bodhisattva. What is reverence? It is a heart of respect. Buddhism and Taoism are foreign species, yet they respect and revere; Bodhisattvas are people of our country, residing in China, known as a land of propriety and righteousness, how can they not know the way of revering Bodhisattvas?" 丨 Saying Reverence for Bodhisattvas. 乂乂乂乂 "Modern Chinese Culture" is: True Dragon Son of Heaven, movie stars, dancing, dog racing, horse racing, national quintessence mahjong, swordsmen, Tongshan Society, Mount Emei, Shaolin Temple, Gelaohui, opium, cigars, white powder, "vases," crawling through dog holes, honey traps, ten sisters, 乂乂ism, 乂乂ism, air heroes, suicide..."</p>
<p>The manifestation of this "motion" in the actions of young people can be illustrated with an analogy: Jia Baoyu's father is a comprador for a foreign firm, so Jia Baoyu gets to study in the United States. After returning to the country, he makes a splash in Shanghai. Coincidentally, Lin Daiyu is studying there, so they fall in love at first sight and go to see movies, play cards, dance, race dogs, and race horses... So they open a room, completing a cash-for-goods love affair. But as usual, there is a broken heart, like Lin Daiyu, who cries and writes many poems. This encounters a professional writer, so she discovers a nobler path than suicide: revolution. If she doesn't want to go this way and doesn't want to commit suicide, then she will encounter a "swordsman" who will use her to run a honey trap, play crawling through dog holes. The outcome is hard to say, perhaps a "prostitute."</p>
<p>Modern Chinese culture is the strangest culture: there are things from two thousand years ago, things from two hundred years ago, and even the most fashionable things. Some of these "cultures" are mixed, some are fundamentally opposed, and some are contradictory yet harmonious. Thus, cultural maladjustment (Cultural Maladjust)ment) is evident everywhere.</p>

<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>During the plum rain season, everywhere is sticky and wet. Sea clouds hang low over the distant hills. The square houses across the Fei Yun River look a bit like pigeon cages. The tide at the dock has just receded, and the stone road is covered with yellow river mud. I slipped step by step to the ferry, which was particularly inconvenient in the rain. The people at the ferry were a bit rough, they were still the same as they were hundreds of years ago. Scolding is an indispensable component of their conversation. Arguing has become their nature. Although small steamships have replaced the rowers, the passengers still stand on the extremely old-fashioned ferry, letting the small steamship tow them in front. People still stand on the ship's railing, and the bottom of the ship is filled with yellow mud and black water. My leather shoes walked quickly on the small road on the south bank. I felt a bit vulgar. Using the fast-walking method used on the sidewalks of foreign metropolises here was unnatural. I wanted them to walk as fast as I did, standing up straight, but in the end, I only saw one person. I didn't want to hunch over and learn to walk slowly like geese. From the ferry to the small lake steamer at Changhu, it was only a few steps, but they walked it as if it were very long. I hoped there was an electric iron shovel that could drag us all together, like a crane, and send us into the small lake steamer. Imagine how happy that would be.</p>
<p>Changhu was still so beautiful, and seeing the secluded lake and mountains, I suddenly felt my own turbidity. The shadow of Mount Yandang was faintly visible in the south. The lake is thirty miles long, and the end of the lake is my hometown. Reeds filled the mouth of Wen Port. The early rice on both banks was fighting with the lake shore in the sunny wind. Hometown, I have been away from you for so long. Shiqiao Bay straddles the lake shore, and banyan trees are planted at both ends of the bridge. The banyan trees lie on the ground, green like a cover. The shade of the banyan trees in summer has a particularly green and tender glow. White birds rest in the green shade. Who can depict this painting?</p>
<p>The lake surface is very wide, with duckweed floating near the shore. The leaves of the duckweed stick to the water surface, so soft and docile. Round like coins, long like chickens, the leaves sometimes grow small white flowers, small but very elegant. There are also some wild lotus flowers, composed of green, fat leaves, and those with magenta flowers. The rowers hate this thing the most, because if wild lotus flowers fill the lake surface, the rowers cannot insert their oars, and if the boat capsizes and people sink, there is no hope of being saved under the wild lotus flowers.</p>
<p>In the small steamer, I saw many public servants wearing badges. Many didn't buy tickets. When the ticket seller spoke to them, they pretended not to see or hear. When the ticket seller asked a second question, they burst into swearing. The Dragon Boat Festival was near, and there were many shop clerks on the boat who were collecting debts from the larger cities to the small towns. They were all dressed very cleanly, in blue pants and white short shirts, some even made of silk. A singer came, dragging out that voice that sounded like a pig being killed, speaking that neither fish nor fowl Mandarin, making people laugh and angry. When his big mouth opened, his brownish-black teeth, several of which had fallen out. I thought the ugliest thing in the world was that face. However, many passengers listened attentively, sometimes even singing along, indicating that they also knew how to hum some "green mountains and green waters."</p>
<p>The fields rippled with green waves, which was the early rice that was about to ripen. Everything in the farmland was orderly. The scenery of the rice fields can be a natural park. The hardworking farmers were still barefoot, busy with their hands there. Medieval cultivation certainly has its own unique interest, but why not teach these strong men who know hard work to go to the big mines and iron factories to produce more wealth for the country, and let one or two machines replace the labor of thousands of people? Of course, I have never seen such an orderly and artistic manor in a foreign country, where machines make the farmland ugly. But we don't want to be fascinated by this point.</p>
<p>The small steamer dragged me forward to a place dragged into the mountains. The narrower the mountains became, the more my happy and sad heart felt a strange taste. "The closer to home, the more timid I become, I dare not ask the passersby." Or is it also a kind of this inexplicable psychological state!</p>
<h3 id="e252">A Summer Evening in the Threshing Ground <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>I will never forget the summer evenings of peaceful times, the lovers' threshing ground in the summer evenings of the countryside. Bat wings flashed in the dusk, a hot and stuffy gaze hung askew on the spider web. Pushing away the rice bowl, wiping away the stinky sweat, adults and children ran to the threshing ground with a bamboo rain cape. There were no unpleasant walls on the threshing ground. The wind blew from the sound of the crops, without any obstruction, like clear streams pouring down from the mountains on all sides. Everyone chose a good place and sat or lay down according to their own wishes. A chaotic greeting from those who came first and those who came later, (recognized by their footsteps, no need to look at their faces) The time came for the last person, and a full moon hung right in the eastern sky. The shadows of the trees swept randomly over this group of people, sweeping away everything, leaving only a wisp of invisible smoke lingering between people. The adults' faces faced the sky, thinking of some star names in their hearts. They used the stars to determine the future, the strings of the Milky Way tied to fate. A comet accidentally swept past, adding a worry to them; the children strongly suppressed their fear, closing their eyes, (in the dark shadow, there was no way to see that face!)</p>
<p>Listening with ears that couldn't be pulled out to the red-haired ghosts, slowly jumping out from the mouths of the adults, until the mothers called remotely from across the wall, (the calls contained affectionate scolding)</p>
<p>Only then did they beg the adults to take them home, and a distant will-o'-the-wisp flashed into the slits of their eyes, desperately clutching the corners of the adults' clothes. A heart-pounding dream came in the night, a red-haired ghost holding a lantern. The night flew in the threshing ground, but people were unaware, unknowingly fading away the stars and moon in the sky. The sunlight squeezed open the eyes of the previous night, and when they got up, they only felt a layer of dew on their bodies. When will there be such peaceful summer evenings again? I will never forget this lovers' threshing ground! (Dared not sleep on a village night on July 5th, wrote this against the stuffy lamplight)</p>

<p>He was silent. He waited—his heart was heavy with unease and pain. In a moment he heard the clatter of the sewing machine again. He heard it pounding his brain, he heard it—monotonous, rapid, relentless and cruel.</p>
<p>"My God! My God!" he murmured. Almost staggering, he sat back down at his desk and collapsed amidst the newspapers and magazines: in the center of the newspapers and magazines flickered a dim light. In front of him were some manuscripts that had already been written, and some still blank sheets of paper. He stared at them. With a strong determination, he picked up his pen. But he saw the pen tip trembling as if it were due to the sound of the sewing machine. The words on the already written pages danced to the rhythm of the sewing machine, and his eyes blurred with the dazzling dance of the words. The trembling of the pen tip penetrated to his cheek, then from his cheek to his arm, from his arm to his head. What else could he write? —he didn't know—he couldn't even remember. Inside him, outside him, there was sound everywhere, nothing but sound. God! God! On the white paper, that paralyzed pen—constantly dipped in ink—only drew mysterious circles—or just let the ink tears flow. It was then a loud ringing of the doorbell strongly shook him from head to foot, and he realized that the first rays of the sun had penetrated through the window, dimming the light.</p>
<p>"It's him!" he thought, and with anxious anticipation he opened the door.</p>
<p>A person walked in, bringing with him some of the cold air of the outdoors; his nose, enclosed between—the brim of a tall top hat with ear flaps and a large shawl under a loose coat that almost hid his thin body, was hardly visible.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Gold Futures Before Margin Call Rebound Ten Yuan <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>News from Honolulu that our country may increase the silver tax has caused excitement, and short sellers have been forced to cover their positions. Yesterday, due to the swap relationship in the gold market, confidence strengthened, and buyers exerted pressure again, causing gold prices to rise by ten yuan. Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, stated in Honolulu that if necessary, there would be restrictions on silver exports and increased silver taxes. Gold prices rebounded by ten yuan. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US rose, but not significantly. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange narrowed by seven cents, rising five cents to three and six. London spot gold rose by half a penny, but exchange rates still saw a slight decrease. American cotton fell by fifteen pounds, American wheat rose slightly, stocks fell slightly, and the rise in futures silver was not strong. Coupled with only six contracts being traded, people were hardly satisfied. Pre-market trading opened steady, but after the opening, banks' appetite remained blocked, and the market was relatively weak. However, with swaps imminent, short sellers naturally tended to cover their positions, and large buyers turned bullish, repeatedly exerting pressure, causing the gold market to gradually rebound. Although the foreign exchange market was supplied by banks, dealers' confidence was firm, and hedging efforts were also strong. The process became tight. In addition, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its rates, which were flat for both the UK and the US, causing gold prices to rise. Banks continued to block, and took advantage of the high prices to supply more, causing a slight setback. However, large buyers continued to buy, and eventually the market became firm. News from the Seattle night market reported that silver prices rose by 0.25 and 1.25, then slightly fell after the rise. Reuters reported that US Acting Treasury Secretary Coolidge confirmed that the supplementary case for silver management would be extended to July 31, and that information on silver strip arbitrage transfers after May 15 would be released on that day. At this time, the gold market was extremely stable, but the potential for a midday close was still bullish. Later, the Seattle night market silver price reported a rise of 1.25, unchanged, and a fall of 1.25. An Associated Press dispatch from Honolulu reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of our country, had information about increasing silver taxes and restricting silver exports. As bills of exchange tightened, buying interest immediately rose outside the market, with the Da Yun gang, Heng Yu, and speculator Mr. Wu all entering, immediately rising to ninety-two yuan and three cents. After the opening, banks remained blocked, although there was a decline, but the Bombay report of a decrease of 6 annas led to frequent purchases by large buyers, further strengthening the market. At the close, Bombay reported another decrease of 1.2 annas, and the situation was stable. Due to the swap situation, short sellers still felt pain. The market situation throughout the day was consistently prosperous. The followings are the recorded prices again:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 986 yuan and 30 cents, up 2 yuan and 10 cents from the previous close.</p>
<p>Goods opened at 6 yuan and 30 cents. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices, with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 3125, and the American exchange rate at 34 yuan 25 cents. After the opening, the exchange rate was 6 yuan and 40 cents. Zhengjin, Huabi, Maijiali, and Mitsui blocked September US dollars at 375. Dadecheng, Yuqingyong, Kangfutaiheng, Shenyu, Fuxingyong, Yuanyongmao, and Yong sold off, falling back to 5 yuan and 10 cents. Yifengyong worked hard to purchase, and Yongli also entered, rising to 1 yuan. However, Dadecheng, Yingfeng, Hengyu, and Yuqingyong still supplied, falling back to 5 yuan and 30 cents. Foreseeing that the HSBC listing would be flat for both the UK and the US, confidence was relatively strong. Yongli, Xifengyong, Dingkang, Chunyuanyong, Yongde, Dadecheng, Qingyu, Tongchun, Fuxingyong, Hengxing, Dafeng, Hengyuanlei, Yong, and others successively purchased. Citibank bought November US dollars at 5625, rising to 7 yuan and 20 cents. Zhengjin, Citibank, and Sassoon blocked August US dollars at 25. The Dalian gang, Dadecheng, Yuqingyong, and Futaiheng took advantage of the high prices to sell off, gradually falling to 6 yuan and 30 cents. Yuanyongmao repeatedly purchased, gradually pulling up the price. After entering, the domestic market slightly tightened, with Yuanyongmao, Qingfayong, Daxingyong, and Fuyu entering, rising to 8 yuan. Yifengyong sold off, falling to 7 yuan and 30 cents. Yuanyongmao, Yuanchangyong, the Dalian gang, and Chengkang entered, rising to 9 yuan. The night market silver price reported a rise of 0.25. Goods, Zhengchangyongli and Hengyu sold off, falling to 7 yuan and 70 cents. Yifengyong, Yuanyongmao, Hongxing, Fuxingyong, and Shunmao bought and pulled up the price by about 1 yuan. At this time, Chengkang supplied, and the situation hovered, but confidence remained good. Dachangxiang and others jointly purchased, and the midday close rose to 988 yuan and 10 cents, with goods at 8 yuan and 70 cents.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 991 yuan and 90 cents. The night market silver price rose and fell. Foreign telegrams stated that Sun Ke had spoken of restricting silver exports. Goods opened at 1 yuan and 30 cents. Hengyu and Dadecheng sold to 1 yuan. Yuanchangyong and Hongxing came in, and rose again to 1 yuan and 90 cents. Banks came out with October US dollars at 3125. Dadechengyu, Yuanmao, and Zhaofengchang sold off, falling to 0.8 yuan. Bombay reported a small decrease of 6 annas. Yuanchun, Fuxingyong, Huixiang, Shenkang, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, and Zhengchang rushed in, rising to 2 yuan and 50 cents. Qingfayong and others sold goods, falling to 1 yuan and 60 cents. Bingxing, Yifengyong, Shunli, Dadecheng, and Zhaofengchang worked hard to buy in, gradually rising to 5 yuan. Yongli, the Dalian gang, Dachangxiang, and Yuanchun sold off. Pangen came out with October US dollars at 25. Maijiali blocked August at 0625, falling to 4 yuan. Yuanchangyong, Changshengyong, and Fuchang took advantage of the low prices to enter, and there was still much rebound. Yuanchun, Yongli, Yuqingyong, and Hengyu and others supplied at high prices, falling to 3 yuan and 50 cents. Bombay telegraphed a decrease of 1 anna.

<p>The silver and money industry today is in a dilemma. For the sake of its own business, it must move forward, but since the drought, crop failures, and the mutual default of grain merchants, spring lending is difficult to fulfill. If this continues, finance will not return to the countryside, and inflation will be difficult to curb. This abnormal situation is not good for the financial industry either. Due to these factors, the market is also lifeless. Although the foreign interbank lending market is better than the previous day by one point, other transactions remain the same. Clearing head has not increased, and has been doing white clearing. Interbank lending transactions have also decreased significantly, with morning transfer and new transactions totaling more than 3.3 million, afternoon transactions more than 300,000, small association transactions more than 3.3 million, and foreign mortgage transactions taking redemption and new transactions more than 900,000. Bank clearing and settlement is similar to the previous days, with foreign banks' clearing bills exceeding 2.0 million, various goods and exchange mortgages exceeding 2.7 million, foreign exchange settlement exceeding 600,000, and warehouse release exceeding 300,000. Chinese banks' clearing bills exceeding 2.1 million, various goods and exchange mortgages and miscellaneous clearing exceeding 2.9 million, special clearing exceeding 600,000, customs duties exceeding 400,000, and warehouse release exceeding 300,000. Japanese banks' clearing bills exceeding 1.6 million, various goods and exchange mortgages and miscellaneous clearing exceeding 3.1 million, and warehouse entry exceeding 300,000. Money shops' foreign public bill clearing exceeding 29 million, foreign clearing head clearing exceeding 3.7 million, banknote recovery and issuance exceeding 1.5 million, cash recovery exceeding 340,000, various remittance routes exceeding 300,000, customer source exceeding 100,000, and legal appetite exceeding 150,000. In addition, the total amount exchanged by the local bill exchange on the 13th was 6,628,003.57 yuan in silver dollars, including 3,959,406.18 yuan in silver dollars, and 2,668,597.39 yuan in exchange silver dollars.</p>

Copper coins also decreased by 1,500 yuan, to 332,500 yuan, with a transaction price of 7,500 foreign silver dollars, equivalent to 24,937 strings and 500 coins.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Securities and Government Bond Market Sentiment Remains Firm, Turning into a Sideways Trend <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the Chinese Securities Exchange became more sideways, and trading gradually decreased. However, whenever there was a large seller, there was always a large buyer, and whenever there was a large buyer, there was always a large seller, as if they were all moving opportunistically and mutually resisting. Therefore, the market price could not fall much, and it was also difficult to rise, resulting in a sideways situation. During this very hot weather, gatherings in the market were already rare, and in previous years they were always unusually quiet. This year, due to the large rise in the previous month, the number of accounts in the exchange was also very large. Slight settlements or swaps easily saw large fluctuations. In terms of the environment, there was hope for a grand union between the west and the center, so now is not the time to short. Yesterday's two sessions were relatively stable, but there were still ups and downs of half a yuan to one yuan. The opening unanimously rose, because of the special shares needed on the fourth, and many followed the trend, so it suddenly rose by three or four cents to one yuan yesterday. However, 96 fell back by about half a yuan due to the exit of bulls. In the second session, 50 was sold quite a bit, although the amount of water was huge, and the fourth seemed to have stopped, so it shrank by two or three cents. Yun 6 continued to rise by two or three cents, and the situation was still sideways, but it was only temporary and not for long. As a result, the market price rose by several cents to one yuan, and 96 fell sharply by eight or nine cents. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 15 million yuan. The results of the rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Yangxing reported that yesterday (12th) the New York stock market fluctuated, there was no bad news, but speculators were waiting for the measures of the Exchange Management Committee, expecting a market reaction, causing the market to hesitate and not stabilize. The trend of gold and silver stocks was relatively flat, and small exchange stocks also saw ups and downs. The bond situation was similar, with US Treasury bonds slightly looser, and real estate and public utility bonds slightly higher than before. Railroad bonds were mixed and slightly higher, and foreign bonds fluctuated wildly. German bonds were looser again. Wheat soared in the morning, but then bulls took profits and settled, resulting in a reactionary animal goods exchange. Silver forward trading was extremely sluggish, with only 150,000 ounces traded throughout the day. The total volume traded was 470,000 shares. According to the report of the bank's New York agent, there was not much selling today, trading was scarce, and price drops were very slight. The flour trade was very large. Observing the market situation today, wheat and corn prices may rise again. Cotton The market situation fell back due to the selling in the south and the profit-taking of bulls. Although there were showers in Texas, it was still insufficient, but all parties were afraid of more rain, so there was no urgent need to be found. Spot trading was very sluggish, while the base was very firm. Rubber The market price fell due to the profit-taking of bulls and limit down. Although today's low price led to some interest, trading was generally not very active. Major markets are very firm. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>It is reported that Yihe Factory issued 2,000 bales of Japanese short positions and continued to increase their stakes. The yarn market is still calm, but the situation is still firm, because the buyers are all powerful bulls, so the market is likely to trend upward. At the same time, the ready-made sales of Guangdong and Sichuan gangs are healthy, so the buyers' intentions are getting stronger. However, the more the Japanese merchants rise, the more they sell, and the rise is slightly restricted by them. However, the output of each factory is small, and the price of cotton is high, so the yarn market seems to be consolidated. However, there are still more than 30,000 pieces of chips in the warehouse, and not much is received. Therefore, it is difficult to rise in the near month, and the far month is also affected, so it is also difficult to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Marked Yarn Falls Near and Flattens Far <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, the American cotton fell by more than 20 pounds. Before the opening, it was expected that it would fall by several cents, but at the opening, the buyers remained calm. The situation in the market tightened instead. When shooting to the far month, it rose by 5.6 cents. Unexpectedly, the cotton opened and the old cotton fell loose. The market price turned soft in the second session, and fell again at the third close. The sales of ready-made yarn in the market are good, but people's hearts have not been stimulated. Some people argue that all matters of Shenxin Factory are well-prepared, and there will be no problems. The yarn factory will not stop work. The consignees in this month have not settled, so the market is weak again. As a result, it fell by 5 cents recently, and it was still flat in the month, with a turnover of 13,800 bales. It was found that Tongji sold 1,950 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Senkang 300 bales, and Yuande 350 bales. Tongxing 350 bales, buying Yuanji 400 bales, Yuanda 400 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Taichang 350 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Runkang 700 bales, and Tonghe 450 bales.

<p>The sales of ready-made yarn are more active, and the purchasing in the south is more active. It was found that the statistics of the amount purchased by each gang throughout the day were 1,614 bales, and the market price rose by 5 cents to 1 yuan. It is also rumored in the market that Yihe Factory issued 20 5-Blessing Shepherd's total of 2,000 bales, pulling the price of 184 yuan and 50 cents. Fellow traders bought it.

<p>The cotton market has risen for three consecutive days, and has also fallen back with American cotton. It is good that the organizers of the bull company have released a large amount of cotton during these three days of rising, and although some speculators have absorbed it, it is still difficult to offset the amount sold. Therefore, the market is loose. As for the drought, in addition to this port, some places have also received showers, but unfortunately the amount of rain is not heavy. It is impossible to predict what the future will be.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Falling Back Two or Three Cents <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, the situation of old cotton was loose. The bull company sold a large amount of cotton for two days, and the flowers received last month were also handed over again, so the market was particularly weak. The new cotton was tired due to the fall of foreign cotton, and the outer ports had slight showers, but the amount absorbed by retail investors was not released. Yuanda turned from short to long. As a result, each month fell by two or three cents. The transaction statistics were 79,400 dan. It was found that Dafu sold 7,600 dan, Tongji 9,300 dan, Shenchang 2,600 dan, Yicheng 1,400 dan, Changfeng 3,500 dan, Runkang 1,100 dan, and Hongchang 4,500 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was tired due to the lack of buyers and the poor news from Liverpool. As a result, the spot price fell by 15 pounds and the futures price fell by 15 to 25 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 45 points. Indian cotton was soft due to profit-taking and selling by European exporters. As a result, Pingguoer fell by half a corner, and Aomusong and Bailuoxi rose by two ropies and seven and a half corners. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>Distant Silver Account Speculators Exit with Over 200,000 Bags. Yesterday's flour market saw mixed price movements upon opening in the morning, with various months showing a confused and intertwined pattern of rises and falls. Chicago wheat quotations remained strong, up by two to three dimes, while Canadian prices fell back by seven to eight dimes or so. At the opening, the current month had fallen nearly a cent, but distant months were supported by continued hot and dry weather and rising rice prices, attracting strong outside buying interest. As a result, opening prices for all months remained stable. Later in the day, the current month saw prices rise due to outside short covering, reaching a peak of $2.20. However, from August onwards, silver account speculators took advantage of the high prices to exit, selling over 200,000 bags, causing market sentiment to soften and lacking the strength to rise further. Although the current situation with drought and floods is serious, widespread food panic is not yet justified. However, speculative manipulation is easily causing public anxiety. As a result, the current month closed up by half a cent, while August, September, and October each fell by half a cent, November fell by 0.75 cents, and December fell by one cent.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Major Wheat Futures Traders Continue to Accumulate <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market remained consistently firm. Chicago wheat quotations remained strong, up by two to three dimes, while Canadian prices fell back by seven to eight dimes or so. At the opening in the morning, near-term sentiment was flat, but distant months were supported by strong bullish sentiment among major traders, who continued to accumulate positions gradually. This situation is due to disrupted inland waterways, which speculators are exploiting to buy heavily, causing premature panic in what is already a situation of natural and man-made disasters. In the afternoon, trading remained active and prices stable, but major bulls continued to absorb supply, inevitably leading to future manipulation. As a result, the current month closed up by three cents, August up by one cent, September and October up by three cents, and November and December up by four cents. Spot wheat prices remained stable for now, with ample arrivals and good mill demand. Opening prices: Xuzhou wheat at $3.18, Bengbu, Mingguang, and Linhuai wheat at $3.14, Wuxi wheat at $3.10, Huangqiao wheat at $3.08, Jiangxin wheat at $3.00, Yangzhou wheat at $2.98, Nanjing wheat at $2.85, and Zhenjiang wheat at $2.96. Fuxin took 10,000 bags, Zaofeng Shenda took 2,000 bags, and Xinda took 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, arrivals in South Shanghai from various sources were very scarce, with only the 13th and 14th batches arriving (estimated at 2,300-2,400 piculs). Market conditions remained firm due to continued drought and shallow inland rivers, creating exceptional tightness. However, outgoing shipments did not seem as active as the previous day, with visiting merchants' appetites reduced. Although Qingdao continued to offer shipments, the quantity was only about 200 bags, and local merchants have been slow to buy, showing little interest. Market prices managed to rise by two to three dimes.</p>
<p>Yesterday in North Shanghai, various districts along the rivers... The sales in the Sixth Concession area were due to scarce supplies caused by prolonged drought. Additionally, river storage was depleted, and outgoing shipments continued to be active. Buyer sentiment was firm, with white japonica rice prices rising by three to four dimes, and white yuan, yangdu, and dufu tip rice varieties following suit, rising by two to three dimes. Guest tip rice varieties rose by a dime.</p>

<p>Local merchants continue to actively purchase inland shipments. Total city transactions reached 30,000 bags. Yesterday, the foreign guest xian rice market surged again due to persistent drought and increasingly anxious sentiment caused by the intense heat. Local merchant buying interest was even more active, especially among local household buyers. Merchants from the local villages and inland Chongming also showed strong buying appetite. The city opened with 8,000 bags of Hunan rice, 6,500 bags of Hankou, Shashi, and Mingguang unpolished rice, 3,434 bags of various xian rice from Wuhu, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Zhangbaling, etc., and 12,000 bags of foreign rice. Local warehouse owners accounted for 80-90% of the purchases, while inland Chongming villages, etc., accounted for over 3,000 bags. Prices rose across the board for various river and mill rice varieties, and the drought disaster prevented inland supplies from being transported to market. Areas experiencing grain shortages saw prices soar, and sentiment remained extremely bullish. Yesterday, small-grain rice opened at $8.35 and $8.30, then rose to $8.40 and even $8.60. Hunan machine oil rose to $9.20, and other mid-range varieties also increased, rising by two dimes, three dimes, or three and a half dimes compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e271">First Batch of New Jiujiang City Gate Soybeans Enters the Market <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of new soybeans from Jiujiang City Gate, Jiangxi Province, arrived at the Fifth Concession via the Ning Shao and Ning Xing steamboats, totaling 270 bags. This year's produce is of excellent quality, dry, and has a 97-98% purity, with clean sand. Unfortunately, the beans are small. The opening price was $3.20, all of which was purchased by Ningbo merchants. According to industry insiders, this price is very fair for the first batch, and later batches may see further increases. Spot soybean market conditions remain unchanged. Outgoing shipments to various locations continue, keeping sentiment stable. Factory shipments to Yingzhou totaled eight or nine cartloads, priced at $2.715 to $2.67. Local wholesale merchants purchased one cartload of Zhengyangguan soybeans, priced at $2.90 to $2.88, one cartload of Feihe soybeans, priced at $2.81, and 200 bags of Guide soybeans, priced at $2.80.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Sugar Market: Cotton and Lotus Sugar Opens with 3,000 Bags <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and weak. The association quoted 14th grade coarse granulated white spot goods at $19.95, without a deal. The wharf delivery price was $20.009, the local warehouse price was $20.10, and the re-export price was $6.45.</p>
<p>Taikoo Fine B Mark was quoted at $20.40, with no transactions. However, there were rumors of deals at $20.30, which needs confirmation. The local factory's No. 1 cotton white sugar continued to sell for $19.00. Changxing Trading Company opened 3,000 bags of bonded warehouse cotton and lotus white sugar, priced at 3.10 Dutch guilders, excluding new regulations and taxes. Chao Ji continued to offer over 200 bags, with delivery prices at $13.50. Longgang green was at $12.40. Gao Mian red opened with over 100 bags, priced at $16.00 to $15.75. Zhiyang white was several dozen bags, at $15.75.</p>

<p>Over 400 boxes of the second batch of new Haikou branches arrived the day before yesterday and were displayed yesterday, with immediate offerings. Relatively high-quality goods, such as Haikou branches, were priced at $11-12, selected Zhuang branches at $16-17, and Shuidong branches at $24-25. Lower quality goods were reduced accordingly. It is rumored that the third batch of over 1,000 boxes is arriving, indicating increasing supply.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Halted by Extreme Heat <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>New York silk mills have reduced working hours and production due to sluggish silk fabric sales, compounded by extreme heat, leading to early summer shutdowns. Raw silk consumption has significantly decreased. Last month (June), total consumption of raw silk from China, Japan, Italy, France, etc., was 33,069 bales, a decrease of 5,671 bales from the previous month (May).</p>
<p>Recently, sales of yellow and white coarse silk to India have declined. Yesterday, the British ship Rajputana exported only 38 bales of Shuangfu silk, Sichuan-Hubei coarse silk, and Jili warp to India.</p>
<p>Currently, overseas silk mills are in the midst of summer shutdowns, resulting in a de facto halt to silk production. However, Japanese silk imports remain strong, causing silk prices to continue to decline. The Shanghai silk market is increasingly sluggish. European firms are taking the opportunity to lower prices and hoard stock. New factory warp and weft are mostly selling at a loss, making sales difficult. Yesterday, only Renji, etc., imported 40 bales of yellow and white factory warp and weft, and prices remained weak.</p>

<p>Wuyuan North Road Zhenmei green tea, since opening in Shanghai last week, has seen no significant changes in prices for high-quality teas. However, ordinary Zhuang teas that have been extracted are in a disadvantageous position. These ordinary Zhenmei teas were quoted by Jardine Matheson yesterday at $104 to $107, a drop of over a dollar from previous levels. As a result, tea merchants are rushing to stop replenishing stock to avoid further losses. Zhenmei teas from Tunxi, Shexian, Xiuning, etc., have seen little price movement, but sales are slow, and a price decline seems inevitable.</p>

<p>Foreign firms have recently become more active in trading Hunan pure antimony, leading to brisk daily transactions. Prices ranged from $370 to $362 per ton for the 40-50 tons traded yesterday and the day before. It is rumored that the sellers were metal shops in the French Concession. However, current arrivals are staggered, and sentiment seems to have slightly firmed.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Drought in the Fields <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Since the start of the plum rain season this year, the weather has been severely dry, and the heat feels like it's already the middle of summer. These past few days, the sun has been blazing, and the heat is oppressive. The mercury has reached a record high of 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit, something we haven't seen before. Even sitting quietly in a room, constantly fanning ourselves, we still feel drenched in sweat and suffocated!</p>
<p>This makes me think, since Heaven hates people suffering from the cold and ends winter, why doesn't it hate people suffering from the heat and shorten summer? If we could turn the round Earth upside down on its north-south axis, the hot and cold climates would naturally balance out. Wouldn't that be something the world would love? But no scientist has the power to reverse the universe like that. So, ever since the "scorched earth and melting stone" days, if you go to the countryside, you'll see that the farmland is cracked like tortoise shells. Even the cotton and beans are so dry that the leaves are yellow and the branches are withered, with little chance of revival. If rice is planted, the seedlings haven't been fully transplanted yet, and farmers are leading their old oxen to pump water day and night in sheds. Or a man and a woman are stepping on the water wheel, their four feet constantly moving. What a hard life! But if things continue like this, with the heat intensifying and the sun blazing like fire, even the rivers next to the fields will eventually dry up. If you don't believe me, listen for the sound of the water wheel, which will naturally disappear from your ears. When that happens, it will be a "drought famine," and it won't be just "suffering from the heat" that people have to endure!</p>
<p>I remember that in the past, if there was a drought, local officials would try to help the people. Even if praying at a temple was purely superstitious, at least they were still thinking about "rainwater," which is essential for the fields. And the villagers would draw bamboo and cut paper for flags, and carry earth idols to make prophecies. From today's perspective, it's all a joke. But nowadays, machines are all-powerful, yet they can't create rainwater and spread it across the land. So what can we do?</p>
<h3 id="e278">Heat <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zixin</p>
<p>In the office, the electric fan whirs and spins, but beads of sweat still burst from my pores. A clean handkerchief quickly becomes sweaty after a few wipes. The line on the thermometer slowly rises, and the electric fan gradually loses its coolness, blowing air that is also somewhat hot!</p>
<p>The flat asphalt road, scorched by the sun, leaves deep imprints where cars pass. Rickshaw pullers, even though their lives are usually difficult, are also stopping their livelihoods—their rickshaws—wherever possible along the roadside under the oppression of this scorching heat. They no longer hustle for customers, but instead gather together, open their tattered clothing, and chat and laugh.</p>
<p>On the streets and alleys, children with ragged clothes and bare feet carry baskets on their backs, running and shouting incessantly: "Ice-cold! Selling ice! Selling ice!" Sweat pours from their bodies. Whether their cries come from the heart or are for the sake of survival, their tone, though not as moving as the din of battle, is filled with sorrow and lament.</p>
<p>Heat exerts its power on ordinary people. But the young masters and misses feel no pain. One by one, they go to Mount Lu or Mogan Mountain to escape the heat. Heat is the heat of ordinary people.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Summer <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that summer is between spring and autumn, a great summer! This summer contains a tremendous driving force. It has fierce sunlight and gentle south winds, and our main food, rice, grows because of this sunlight and these south winds. Summer is also the transition period for all kinds of grasses. The grasses are greenest at this time, and they gradually turn yellow.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, who knows how much stinky sweat has been squeezed out of the coolies, and who knows how many black hair towels have been soaked? At the same time, in the leisurely state under the electric fan, who knows how much ice and soda have been stuffed into the big mouths of the leisurely people.</p>
<p>The revealing flesh on the streets, who knows how many youths whose blood has not yet settled have been anesthetized, and who knows how many increased illusions, spring dreams.</p>
<p>The domination of the environment, the emergence of hundreds of ice-drinking rooms at the right time; ice cream and soda have iced the boiling patriotic hearts. Ah! Great summer!</p>
<p>It is also the time when bacteria are active. Under their wings, who knows how many wives’ husbands, sons’ fathers, husbands’....fathers....have been sacrificed! Ah! Great summer!</p>
<h3 id="e280">Rainmaking Technique <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>The plum season is originally a rainy season. But since entering the rainy season this year, it hasn't rained for a long time. And the weather is scorching, even worse than the summer heat. The sun is like a pot of red-hot charcoal, burning the skin and scorching the rice fields, making them crack. The tender green rice seedlings are already showing signs of withering. Farmers are hoping for rain every day! I remember when Zhang Zongchang was governor of Shandong, because it hadn't rained for a long time, he ordered his subordinates to place several cannons on the tops of high mountains and fire twelve shots to ask the heavens for rain! And Feng Yuxiang, an important figure in the northwest, once gathered hundreds of bundles of thatch on a high mountain and burned them, the flames soaring into the sky. After the fire went out, sure enough, there was a heavy rain. This was because of the change in the air, which is very consistent with scientific principles.</p>
<p>Sian hasn't had rain for a long time, and several village chiefs have informed the villagers to choose several barren mountains covered with long grass, and cut the grass around them, forming a boundary line. The fire was lit the other day, and it has not been extinguished after three days and nights. The flames are raging, and the sky is red. It is especially spectacular at night. The firelight winds for dozens of miles, like a swimming dragon. There are many people standing on the Shunxing Gaoqiao watching. The burning lasted for three days and four nights, and when the fire went out, the sky was overcast, and raindrops the size of soybeans fell. Unfortunately, the rain stopped after a short time. This experiment has been successful, and it is said that a large-scale event will be held next time. The progress of science is really rapid! Even the towns and villages know that science is omnipotent.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Seaside Summer <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Jiu</p>
<p>The sun of the East Sea shines on the beach, glittering golden. It combines with the vast green water of the river to form a beautiful color. The gentle breeze blows the waves, and the small stones make a magnificent rhythm. Summer has arrived on the banks of Gaoqiao!</p>
<p>The beach, which is as quiet as a desert, has been very busy these days. The Shanghai Municipal Ferry from Nanjing Road and the Bund carries people to the beach. At 12 o'clock, they carry suitcases, which contain bathing suits, travel stools, cameras...The faces of men and women all show a hint of a smile. They are very fortunate to be washed by the sea water.</p>
<p>After an hour's journey by public transport, they have arrived at their destination丨the beach丨and are walking along the embankment towards the bathing beach. The barren smoke covers the weeds, revealing a corner of the red wall of the "Dragon King Temple." The tragic shadow of the "January 28th Incident" suddenly surged into the minds of those who were there to mourn. The white waves roared like enemy ships firing their cannons. Looking at the smoke and trees of Wusong on the opposite bank, everything is in a state of war. "To hell with national affairs, let's take a sea bath!" With a call to arms from an advocate of entertainment to save the country, the women rushed into the dressing room of the "Beach Hotel." They took off their coats, cheongsams....One by one, healthy and beautiful bodies approached the soft beach to prepare to enter the water.</p>
<p>Between the sky and the water, there are countless men and women in red and green bathing suits, like a painting unfolding. The mermaids are floating and sinking, laughing and playing. They startled the white seagulls, who suspected that they were mandarin ducks playing in the water, and circled above them. Those who are bathing all feel the joy of "ascending to heaven."</p>
<p>After sea bathing, they go ashore to wash with clean water, pure and flawless. Resting briefly on a canvas chair, they sing loudly, harmonizing with the folk songs of the herdsmen and village girls. They enjoy the benefits of sunbathing. They pour out the soda, bread, and snacks from their suitcases, and enjoy a picnic on the spot, gobbling and devouring, and having a lot of fun. What a pleasant trip to Gaoqiao!</p>
<h3 id="e282">Praying for Rain <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>The plum season is hotter than the dog days. It is said that the great drought of the Jiaxu year, Xianfeng six years, will be repeated. My great-grandmother often said that in Xianfeng six years, they were chanting Buddhist scriptures at the bottom of the Chaohe River to pray for rain. If it doesn't rain in a few more days, I am really worried about the farmers in my hometown and many other places.</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Association paraded the other day. It is said that the purpose was also to pray for rain. The sound of gongs and drums rang for a while. The landlord said that they had already reached the Dong Yokohama Road. Everyone went to watch, and I also followed along in the heat.</p>
<p>The procession丨the guards of honor, horses, Bodhisattvas, meat offerings; the scene was roughly the same as in my hometown: but the members of the procession were much more beautiful, mostly in silk crepe de chine short jackets and trousers, Indian silk long shirts, and some were also wearing newly styled straw hats made in the opening port of Milan. Beautiful people carried the Bodhisattvas around, just like the ancient rainbow temple was perched on the completely Westernized Nanjing Road, similarly uncoordinated (although they were there to pray for rain).</p>
<p>The onlookers were as unafraid of the heat as the members of the procession. The sides of the street were crowded. Some people even held incense, very sincere, presumably benefactors who sponsored this great event. Because I was a little dizzy, I quietly returned home alone first.</p>
<p>In the evening, there was a gust of wind, flashes of lightning, and faint sounds of thunder, but the rain did not fall after all. The members of the procession must have been very disappointed.</p>
<p>Although I do not approve of praying for rain in that way, I long for rain very much.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Economical Ways to Cool Down <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Lou Fenglouzhu</p>
<p>In this scorching summer, those who walk in the sun are certainly hot, but even those in the house are constantly complaining about the heat! heat! Now I have thought of several ways to cool down without spending money, which I will write below:</p>
<p>Always keep your mind calm in hot weather. Most people's minds are bound to be irritable, but as the saying goes, "A calm mind is naturally cool." So you must first seek to be calm, and deal with things gently, and naturally you will be able to reduce the heat.</p>
<p>Read more books and paintings. Reading books and viewing paintings is a good way to pass the time and extend your life. It is best to browse more texts about recording cold winters and paintings of frost and ice, as if you were there, and your whole body will feel cool.</p>
<p>Tell each other stories. In the spare time after work, gather friends or family together, especially after dusk in the summer night. Lay out chairs and couches, sit with your head uncovered and your legs crossed, and tell each other interesting stories. At that time, the breeze is blowing gently, and you will be happy and forget your fatigue. This is also a supreme way to cool down for the common people.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Summer in Guangzhou <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Ling</p>
<p>(1) River Tour</p>
<p>When the hot summer arrives, you can hear a charming and delicate shout in the eastern and southern banks of Guangzhou in the evening; "Diaojing ah, (a homophone for boat), sir!" The people who shouted out this sound are the Zhujiang girls who stand on the banks of the Pearl River.</p>
<p>If you fancy someone, you can hook up with her a few words, or specify the price, (usually 6 jiao to 1 yuan and a half), and you can</p>
<p>Follow the Pearl girl into the boat and spend a comfortable night on the boat. But according to the prohibition, the Pearl girl is not allowed to sell her beauty, so you lie on the small deck at the bow of the boat, and the Pearl girl can only sit three or two feet away from you; although your hands cannot move, you can say anything you want, and no one will interfere with you. But what the Pearl girl says to you is always the same, either saying that she came out to be a Pearl girl because of poverty, or that she needs some kind of clothes now, but she has no money to buy. When you hear this kind of talk, it seems to be sincere, but when you get used to hearing it, you will gradually laugh it off!</p>
<p>(2) Rafting</p>
<p>Lizhi Bay in Guangzhou is already well-known in the country; if you want to raft, you can go there. But rafting is just a nice name for it, and the real purpose of going to Lizhi Bay is mostly to "find oil",) which means to see women (. I don't understand what Lizhi Bay used to be like, but the current Lizhi Bay is no different from the Qinhuai River, but a small river flowing with muddy water. There are many people who want to go there, and there are many exquisite yachts in between, and there are countless people selling boat porridge, ice cream, and fresh fruits. Of course, there is a big reason for this, and that reason is the "searching for oil" that I said.</p>
<p>A good place!</p>
<p>(3) Swimming Swimming has become a summer sport for the general fashionable men and women in Guangzhou. There are as many as five public swimming pools that specialize in swimming for business, and there are also private swimming pools such as the YMCA swimming pool and the Provincial No. 1 Middle School swimming pool.</p>
<p>Among the so-called five public swimming pools, the most lively one is the Water Swimming Pool. The whole field is built with Sminto: only the corridor, sleeping board, etc., extending from the river surface are made of wooden boards and bamboo awnings. Once it is time for the water to rise, whether it is day or night, the young men and women who come to swim are really more numerous than the crossing crucian carp! It is originally a happy thing for everyone to mix in a big swimming pool, and besides, after swimming, there are also things like selling milk coffee, fried noodles, and fish porridge, so the swimming pool in Guangzhou in summer is really a booming business! However, it is said that mixed swimming for men and women has now been restricted. I think that the swimming pool this summer will definitely not be as grand as before!</p>
<p>(4) Shamian Shamian is a noun, which is the name of the place designated for foreign devils to live in. Because it is a place where foreign devils live, and it is also a small island located on the west bank, the scenery is indescribably beautiful! In this hot summer, there are quite a few people who come to Shamian for a walk and to cool off. Especially at night, sitting on the riverbank, looking at the full bright moon, facing the Pearl River in front, and the small navigation lights on the Pearl River, that kind of feeling is also very poetic.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it doesn't cost money to enter Shamian, and you can also get considerable freedom. As long as you are not wearing ragged clothes, the French soldiers guarding the bridge gate have no reason to stop you, so there are always people who come here to cool off and take a walk. This can also be considered a good place in Guangzhou in summer!</p>
<p>In addition to touring the river, rafting, swimming, and going to Shamian to cool off, Guangzhou does not lack good places of interest and good places to go, but those are not suitable for summer, so they will not be mentioned!</p>

<h3 id="e285">Guangdong Province Forbids Co-ed Swimming <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Between men and women, it can be said that it is no longer a problem. Although the marriage system still exists today, it is equivalent to "Qi Luo", without any meaning. However, there are still a few friends who have nothing to do and are still busy with getting married and divorced.</p>
<p>I am not fabricating this. Looking at the divorce condition precedents announced by the Judicial Yuan the other day, we can already see the bankruptcy of the marriage system. The precedents say, "The so-called unbearable abuse of cohabitation not only refers to physical"</p>
<p>limitations, but also the mental feeling of unbearable abuse of cohabitation." If interpreted in this way, if one party wants a divorce, is there any fear of lacking an excuse? Whether this precedent is right or wrong is not within the scope of this discussion. I mention it only to prove that there is not much relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Guangdong is the most open province in our country and also the earliest to be open. However, the minds of its officials are laughably rigid. According to the newspaper the other day, Guangdong recently banned all swimming, and Zheng Ridong, the director of the Supervisory Bureau, petitioned the Executive Council to prohibit men and women from holding hands in the street. What does it matter? What is the meaning of insisting on prohibiting it? Judging from the current trend, it is clearly a step backward.</p>
<p>If we talk about the politics of Guangdong Province, how deeply it harms the local area, but we have never heard of preparing to prohibit it. But what harm is there in men and women swimming and walking together? Why must it be prohibited? It is truly "clear enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but not a cartload of firewood." The most taboo for those in power is not starting with the big picture, but being vigorous and resolute on trivial matters. This is the biggest problem for those in power these days.</p>
<p>Open social interaction between male and female friends has become a national law. Since it has been made public, the extent to which it is public is naturally not limited. "Swimming together" and "holding hands" are also a form of openness. The reason why the relationship between men and women in China has become a great mystery throughout the ages is mostly due to the shackles of hypocritical Confucian principles such as "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving." This has led to many romantic wrongs. If we take apart the Western mirror, the relationship between men and women is as ordinary as cloth, silk, beans, and millet. What problem is there? Therefore, Mencius said, "Food and sex are human nature." Since it is human nature, how can laws and rituals judge it? Where can laws and rituals be effective in judging it?</p>
<p>The more private salt is banned, the better it sells. Before open social interaction between men and women, could rituals and laws really bind them? Then, matters such as "lack of propriety in the boudoir" are like what newspaper sellers shout, "Twenty-four kinds of lewd secrets, everything is available." Not to mention that, even those openly recorded in history are countless. Often, due to the reasons of "family scandals should not be publicized" or "the words of the mediator cannot be spoken," they just "rolled up their ears and ate jellyfish," barely glossing over it and considering it settled.</p>
<p>Marriage is already based on the principle of freedom. As long as "I love you," you can be considered husband and wife. Then divorce must also be based on the principle of freedom. As long as "I resent you, you resent me," both parties can break off the relationship. Therefore, the union of husband and wife is equivalent to the union of friends. It means staying together if you agree and leaving if you don't. If the relationship between husband and wife is already like this, what does it matter if they swim together or hold hands?</p>
<p>Laws can only move forward with the times. If a law violates the times and is forcibly enforced, although it may be possible to force it for a while, the tense state and the commotion cannot last long. Therefore, those in power cannot focus on the big picture and instead devote their efforts to minor details, they will definitely not be able to do things properly.</p>
<h3 id="e286">An Open Secret <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>A secret is a secret, and public is public, so it is not surprising that a secret becomes public. However, an open secret still has three points of secrecy. Smoking opium is prohibited by law, so most smokers keep it secret, and even the place where it is sold is called "Swallow's Nest," probably meaning sneaky. However, everyone has had this experience. On the road, you can smell the stench (smokers say it's a fragrance) from that famous "Swallow's Nest." According to a friend of the reporter who likes to mind other people's business, besides a laundry and an opium mixing shop, every door in there is a nest. However, everyone considers this secret to be an open secret. There are countless examples like this in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Although the number of people who have actually seen it is very few, everyone has the image of a tool of torture with a hundred faces. It is said that after gang members, bandits, and robbers are caught, if they don't confess, they are usually forced to do so through electric torture. These kinds of people who murder and rob are naturally hateful, and it wouldn't be too excessive to receive a little private electric torture. However, the law should be clear about rewards and punishments. If a good man who wouldn't dare to take a penny from someone were subjected to electric torture, and we asked him what crime he committed, he would rather admit to being a robber or a gang member to avoid the pain. I think this situation is probably unavoidable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the court often uses the confession presented by the police as the standard for making a final judgment in all cases. Many defendants, after being coerced by the police, cannot even get a fair trial in court when they try to recant their confessions. In a letter of opinion to the president of the First Special District Court, the Lawyers Association stated: "The next day in court, the police immediately present the confession as evidence of the defendant's admission. The court often does not investigate and attaches the confession to the file as the basis for the judgment. Afterwards, even if the defendant wants to argue about the truth, the examiner is prejudiced, and the effect is minimal. The police's plan is greatly successful, and the use of electric torture is greatly enhanced." Lawyers have more contact with the court, so they naturally understand the abuses of private torture more than the average person. Moreover, according to the above, it seems that the court's judgments are all based on the police's confessions, which means that electric torture has been used openly.</p>
<p>For the sake of humanity and the judicial rights in the concession, we should consider the electric torture, this tool of open secret, as a serious issue, taking the case of Cai Yangqi as an example. We plead for the countless unfortunate people in the future!</p>

<p>— Hong</p>
<p>It was five o'clock in the evening. I walked out of the steamer-like scorching house, turned from XX Road to XX Road, and when I arrived at the entrance of XX Lane, I saw two laborers who looked like beggars fighting in a group. I don't know how many people were watching the excitement. Suddenly, a basin of ice water was poured down from a window upstairs, right onto the two struggling coolies. Their hair was dripping wet. Then, the gazes of the surrounding crowd all shifted to the window. At this time, half of a Western gentleman's smiling face appeared in the window, grinning. The onlookers all cursed, "XXXX." The Western gentleman didn't understand and grinned the same way. The fighting coolies were still fighting, and more and more people gathered to watch, and the circle expanded even further.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, the Western gentleman felt particularly uncomfortable, and the vivid comedy ended silently. So the Western gentleman had a brilliant idea. He threw a small piece of bread out of the window, and sure enough, the vivid drama immediately revived. A group of beggars scrambled for it. From the side, it seemed that the bread was not eaten by anyone, but was clearly trampled into ashes. The Western gentleman was smiling triumphantly, waving his hand triumphantly. The beggars looked up at the Western gentleman expectantly. The Western gentleman felt that this was not bad, so he brought a large batch of bread and placed it on the windowsill. When the beggars saw it, they all clapped their hands. I saw from a distance that the bread was a greenish color, probably moldy, or it was always leftover scraps that were no longer edible. The Western gentleman threw a piece every few minutes, and the beggars trampled each other every few minutes. As a result, the Western gentleman finished throwing the bread, and a thick layer of bread crumbs was added to the ground.</p>
<p>Then, half of the Western gentleman's face disappeared, and the giggling and thunderous applause were no longer heard. The beggars and the people who were watching the excitement all dispersed in the evening twilight.</p>
<p>Readers, please remember! This is the kind of entertainment that ordinary Western gentlemen play with their generosity and benevolence towards non-elite Chinese people!</p>

<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>Recently, I met many old classmates at a dinner party. When I asked about their recent situation, they all said that they were not very satisfied and that they were just writing articles.</p>
<p>This phenomenon made me think deeply for a long time. In some magazine, a critic said that the Chinese literary world in recent years is as desolate as a dilapidated temple. Except for Mao Dun's "Midnight," there are no books that can be browsed. Old writers seem to live in seclusion like hermits, and new writers are simply not worth learning from! (The main idea)</p>
<p>Although he said that the old writers were unwilling to work hard, the field of literature does not allow us writers to set foot in. Besides Mao Dun's "Midnight," the works of other old writers are also flooding the market (or there are simply no books that can be browsed). However, he gave new writers a categorical judgment of "simply not worth learning from." At the same time, some people have said that there is no distinction between old and new writers in our literary world. If there is excellent work, the new writer is the old writer, and the old writer is not necessarily much better than the new writer.</p>
<p>But look, as soon as the name of a new writer is discovered in the literary world, he looks at the faces of the old writers so pitifully because of his "newness," and waits even more painfully for the iron pens of those so-called critics. Of course, we cannot deny that the works of new writers are immature and need the guidance of old writers and the correction of critics. But instead of encouragement, they forcefully put an iron ring around your neck. As a result, the Chinese literary world is as desolate as a dilapidated temple, and old writers live in seclusion. New writers are simply not worth learning from, and Mao Dun's "Midnight" represents the Chinese literary world.</p>
<p>This path is obviously impassable, but why don't young people have something to do? Is this the way out for college students?</p>
<p>Young people, hurry back! The things you learned from your professors are not needed in the literary world. Although the entire society is also squeezing you out, if you apply what you have learned appropriately, you may be able to achieve some success. Look back quickly! Two rounds of artillery fire have already destroyed half of the country. Writers are just shouting in the ballroom. The responsibility still lies on your shoulders. So why bother working hard in the literary world, where there is a huge divide between old and new writers? Even if you are good at flattering and climbing, and you manage to squeeze onto the throne, is that your original intention when you entered college?</p>
<h3 id="e290">The Golden Hoop and Titles <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dan</p>
<p>I once read "Journey to the West." There was a most active figure in it, Sun Wukong. He was originally an ape, but because he was intelligent, he had caused havoc in the Heavenly Palace and turned over the Hell. One somersault could travel 108,000 miles. Unfortunately, he was spotted by the Guanyin Bodhisattva. She wanted to use him to help Tang Sanzang go to the Western Paradise to "fetch the scriptures," so she put a beautiful golden hoop on his head and said to him, "Monkey, look, how beautiful is this? You wear this. I wouldn't give it to anyone else." Although the monkey was intelligent, he was still an animal. He saw that this thing was glittering with a strange beauty, so he put it on. That was a mistake. He could never take it off again. He couldn't think about the Heavenly Palace anymore, and he couldn't think about turning over the Hell anymore. Although he could still do the 108,000-mile somersault occasionally, it was only limited to saving his master Tang Sanzang. If you want to mess around? You can, but a tight-hoop mantra will reward you with an upside-down somersault hanging from the sky.</p>
<p>Now there are also two things in the literary world that are similar to the golden hoop: the circle held high by critics and the various titles that essay writers casually pick up. The most similar is the circle in the hands of critics, which is gilded and may be as beautiful as the golden hoop on Sun Wukong's head. When a new writer publishes an article, our critics must first put the circle on it. If it doesn't fit, they say, "Hey! Kid, you're wrong. The consciousness is not accurate, and the art is not successful! Kid, come on, follow me, it's so good." So the new writer stretches out his head and slips in gently. Sorry, hum! If you move, the circle will tighten and strangle you. At most, you can wave the flag, beat the drums, and help out for a few years.</p>
<p>Then there are the titles that essay writers casually pick up.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Endless Nonsense <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>In the summer, some people are so hot that they are dying but still have to work, while some people don't work and are not hot, and sometimes they even catch a cold because they are too cool.</p>
<p>Rich people work, relax, and have fun in cool places, so they wear neat and beautiful clothes. But because they wear neat and beautiful clothes, when they see poor people taking off their clothes and baring their backs when they are so hot that they are dying, they say disgustedly, "They really don't pay attention to hygiene." People who are driving around in cars are surprised to see people walking on the roadside covered in sweat. People sitting in rickshaws yell at the rickshaw pullers, "It's so hot, hurry up!" They all seem to not know that other people are much hotter than them.</p>
<p>Streetcar drivers curse "pig" when rickshaws obstruct the driving of their streetcars. Rickshaw pullers curse "pig" when wheelbarrows obstruct their progress. People pushing wheelbarrows also curse "pig" when poor urchins impede their way! Humans all like to use their authority.</p>
<p>Dancers look down on prostitutes, movie stars look down on dancers, but female doctors look down on movie stars. In fact, from the perspective of women's professions, half a catty is equal to eight taels. Everyone is serving society and making a living. Prostitutes are also serving society, do you object? A certain city openly announced that opening prostitution is the only way to prosper the city.</p>
<p>It also has the same effect as the golden hoop, which is also put on the head. Before an essay writer wants to engage in a literary battle with someone, he must first pick up some titles such as "scholar," "celebrity," "master," "elder," "professor," and "authority," and press them heavily on your head, while pushing you onto a throne and secretly using a rope to hang you and the throne halfway up in the sky. Then he waves the "writing brush" or the sharp point of the Conklin gold pen and stabs you all over. Do you feel pain? You have to endure it without moving. If you move, you will fall from halfway up in the sky. Do you want to fight back? "Hum, push him down and kill him."</p>

<h3 id="e293">The Hope of Marriage, Where Does It Lie? <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>In this sweltering summer heat, I truly shouldn't be bothering you, sir. However, this matter is pressing, and I wish to resolve it as quickly as possible, so I must trouble you. Please forgive me, please forgive me.</p>
<p>I have a friend who, two years ago, developed feelings of love and admiration with his classmate's younger sister. However, this love is very pure; they have only spoken a few times and taken a few walks together. According to him, their love stems from her good temperament and her thoughts and actions, which are different from modern women who worship vanity. She is also able to endure hardship and be hardworking. She loves him because he is not a spoiled son of a wealthy family but a rather sincere and honest person.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, their spirits are aligned, and they should proceed to the second step of the engagement process. However, the problem arises at this point: he is a member of the proletariat, so where does the hope of marriage lie? He feels that his job is always precarious, and he doesn't know how to arrange his future personal life. How can he rashly marry her, leading to endless future suffering? He doesn't want to be a husband who goes against his conscience and shirks responsibility; he doesn't want her to marry him and lose the happiness of a good future. Therefore, even though he loves her with all his heart, he still hasn't gotten engaged to her. This is a last resort.</p>
<p>However, her family no longer allows her to live the life of a daughter and often forces her to marry. Because she is in love with him, she has refused every time. Last week, her mother said to her, "Mr. Wang's temperament and knowledge are both good" (actually, she doesn't know anything about him), "and I have also consulted the gods and divined by trigrams. They all say that your birth years and elements match his very well. Why not choose an auspicious day to meet him?" She ignored her again, so her mother was very unhappy and threatened her sternly, "You don't like this one, you don't like that one, and you just happen to love him. He can't get married now. If you wait until he can get married and he doesn't marry you, what will you do?" She told him about this and sought his opinion. He said very frankly, "I am currently unable to marry, and I can't bear to get married because I can't get married, thereby ruining your youth. Love doesn't necessarily mean marriage. Even if you are forced to marry, our friendship will not be lost because of this. What's there to be afraid of?" After hearing this conclusion, she felt doubtful and uncertain, and three different guesses arose! 1. Plead with him to promise to love her in the future, then she would rather "remain chaste and wait," no matter how long it takes, and would be willing to share joys and sorrows without complaint after marriage. 2. Think that he is ungrateful and forgets love. 3. Absolute pessimism, letting the family blindly dictate, lamenting her own bad fate. He also has no definite direction: 1. Promise her, but afraid that he cannot afford it economically. 2. Give her up, but cannot bear to (because such a woman is truly rare). 3. If he delays any longer, he is afraid of betraying her youth.</p>
<p>Editor, sir, how can the contradictions and difficulties in his heart be resolved? Should he agree to her or reject her? Should he be a heartless person? Do members of the proletariat have no right and obligation to engage in love and enjoy sexual desire? With my shallow knowledge, how can I solve it for him? I can only ask you, sir, to think of a reasonable solution for him, because her mother is forcing her to ask him for a thorough answer. Deeply grateful, I wish you good health. Yu Shi respectfully.</p>
<p>Answer: Under modern social relations, the burden of marriage is indeed the greatest worry for most people who rely on wages for a living. Every unmarried young man often imagines the sweet family happiness of his future, and constantly hopes to obtain a beautiful, moving wife who is in tune with his temperament and can comfort each other, but when he thinks of the hardships of real life, his heart turns cold. It is true that due to job instability and economic hardship, it is very dangerous to rashly get married without foresight. However, is life not difficult without marriage? Isn't an individual's life after unemployment just as impossible to "arrange"? In that case, what is the difference between marriage and not marrying? Life is very difficult, and we all need to work hard to struggle and fight. Therefore, your friend is commendable for being afraid of losing her future happiness because he is poor and not daring to agree to marry her, but this passive attitude is actually of no benefit to them. The goodness of a family is a natural human desire. Can he truly restrain himself and not seek satisfaction in an improper way? This is probably impossible. Since it is impossible, then why not seek proper satisfaction, that is, get married.</p>
<p>As for what you said, "Do members of the proletariat have no right and obligation to engage in love and enjoy sexual desire?" I feel that the question should not be posed in this way. Because the proletariat cannot engage in love and enjoy sexual desire, it is impossible due to their material conditions, and they are bound by social relations, not that they do not have this right. Therefore, people who generally cannot afford to marry should not passively avoid marriage due to the constraints of life. Not marrying still cannot solve life, but should actively break through the encirclement of difficulties and make marriage not constrained by the difficulties of life. The reason why our lives are difficult is due to social causes, which has nothing to do with marriage. Therefore, according to my understanding, if your friend's lover is truly a person who can "share joys and sorrows without complaint," your friend cannot "reject" her because of economic difficulties.

<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>Five. A conversation over the waltz melody: Karl: At first, your depressed look was really unbearable! Lan: (Forced smile) It's not my own wish either.</p>
<p>Karl: Look, everyone is laughing and happy, why are you the only one with such an ugly face? Lan: (Her face fell) Living a luxurious life, putting on a false face, maneuvering in front of some hypocritical and shallow faces, while my own sorrow is that other people's days are short. Slowly wasting my youth like this, how can it not make people sad? Karl: Think of a way to jump out of the circle of life. Lan: It's not easy! A decadent life will cruelly destroy everything. Karl: Not necessarily, if you always face the dark side, you will always feel distressed! Lan: (Looking at him with a suspicious expression) The dark clouds of life are always heavily pressing on my heart, how can I not be distressed?</p>
<p>Karl: I really can't bear to see you like this, muster up your courage and fight with life. Lan: (Bitterly) Sigh, "fight," where do I start? A decadent heart and a decadent life! Karl: (In a comforting tone) Lan, don't be discouraged, there's always a way. You're so young and have so many good days ahead, try to look towards the bright side.</p>
<p>Lan: (Just staring blankly, as if remembering something, silent, sighing) Karl: This song is over, I have to go, see you tomorrow. Lan: (Startled, and then affectionately, just staring at him in a daze) Karl: What are you thinking about? You don't say anything, I'm really not happy standing in front of this face! Lan: I'm unspeakably happy in front of you, because I've never met someone who can sympathize with me. I'm so happy! Let me smile for you (So she smiled coquettishly)</p>
<p>Karl: I'm leaving now.</p>
<p>Lan: Is it okay to stay a little longer? (Enthusiastically)</p>
<p>Karl: Look, it's almost dawn. Lan: (Disappointed) Come tomorrow.</p>
<p>Karl: Maybe I will. Lan: Definitely come, it's really hard to find someone like you!</p>
<p>Karl: I'll come whenever I have time.</p>
<p>Lan: Come no matter what (Her lips approached) Karl: I'll come if you want me to (Teasing her intentionally) Lan: Don't say such things, it will break people's hearts! Karl, if you don't despise me. Come earlier tomorrow, let's have a good chat.</p>
<p>Karl: Haha, I love you entirely (Whispering in her ear) Suddenly, he grabbed the woman's waist tightly, her body shrank, her lips puckered up, and a string of kisses lightly landed on her lips, like plum rain, Lan just kept laughing like a string of pearls! The end!</p>
