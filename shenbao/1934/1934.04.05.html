<p>寗夏軍事糾紛以中央機宜處置。而告解决。孫殿英離開前綫。其部隊收編遣散之舉。亟待着手辦理。蓋孫部份子複雜。紀律散漫。如不妥爲安排。殊非癬　之患。吾人爲寗夏陜北之人民生計着想。萬不可任其放縱。致成將來之隠憂也。</p>
<p>不寗惟是。現在亂事雖告結束。地方秩序。尚未恢復。人民刦後餘生。無能爲力。政府職責所在。不能不一援之手。治標救急之道甚多。舉其要者。一曰安撫流亡。查黃河後套一帶。以迄於廿陜境地。原爲比較富庶之區。祗待開發。短時期内不難殷實。然自民國十五年後。號稱［黃河百弊唯富一套］之河套。竟至路斷人稀。往日阡陌。多渝爲荒蕪。嘗考其故。實因歷年在河套開墾之人。多屬晋冀諸省士著。春耕而往。秋收而歸。在彼地落籍者甚少。近年幾經兵燹。益以匪災。農民本身缺乏自衛能力。自更裏足不前。　至河套穀倉。竟至種子之微。亦感缺乏。孫軍駐紥五原時。軍隊人數。且較當地人民爲多。供應之勞。不勝疲弊。加以數月來之戰時徵發。共苦况實非　渴二字所能形容者也。今戰事甫息。全局初定。而伏莽未清。小股土匪。仍須嚴防。然後晋冀諸省農民。始肯繼來耕種。當地人民亦不致流亡失所。第二曰肅清貪污。力求政治之清明。地方負責長官。如能省刑薄歛。廉潔自好。則民心悦服。安土樂業。第三曰　通運輪。河套寗夏雖僻處邊陲。而經濟關係。已漸次脱離原始狀態而入於商品交易時期皮革穀物已向異地輸出數尚可觀。但自兵興以後。運輸阻隔。非但當地商業交通。頻於窒塞。卽平津兩地。亦受間接影響。是故溝通運輸之舉。亦刻不容緩。</p>
<p>以上三端。僅爲臨時救急之企圖。以西北面積之廣漠。國防之重要。僅此三端。自不足以言盡善盡美所幸開發西北。已爲國人一致之呼聲。自廿肅寗夏黃河後套以至新疆青海。皆認爲有亟待開發之必要。惟青新道遠。以目前中　　　經濟力與人力。僅能先就政治方面加以輔導。尚不能直接進行開發工作。獨河套則異是。今日已可由平綏路直達包頭。屯墾之舉。不難實現。不過農村經濟週轉遲緩。南方已然。北鄙尤甚。非有巨大財力以爲後援。則難有成功之望。此類墾務。其先應由國家出資。自不待言。俟有相當成績後。則民間繼起投資。定必踴躍。經委會議决撥欵二百五十萬元爲開發西北之用。雖屬杯水車薪。難著成效。幸而得此。究勝於無。今後開發西北。要當由政府人民。共任鉅艱。政府能爲先驅。吾人當作後盾。不此之圖。徒唱高調。亦無謂也。</p>

<p>蘇聯左右全歐奥匈極力掙扎</p>
<p>法德衝突正烈法意惡感又起</p>
<p>自法蘇商約成立以後、歐洲一般的外交形勢、卽急轉直下、從前的外交戰綫、大有另行改組過的趨向、原來歐洲問題多少年來、到現在還是以法德兩國爲中心、一起一伏、一勝一敗、都是這兩個國作基幹、世界大戰以後、仍舊如此、在法國的意思、以爲最好能够抑制着德國、且抑制得越長久越好、她所運用的武器｜｜抑制德國的武器｜｜有兩個、一個是凡爾賽和平條約、其他一個是國際聯盟、凡爾賽條約是限制德國向上發展的恊約、這種恊约、非但是恊約國公認、卽德國自己也曾經簽字、國際聯盟、本來包含有世界上資本主義各國（但美國不在内）、德國也加入過、不過去年年末他已退出去了、其實凡爾賽和約、特别是賠欵的規定、令德國多向美國借欵、並促成德國的復興、致爲今日法國的勁敵、而歐洲諸小國、原來是法國要他們作衛星、以共同對付德國的、不料今年一月二十六日德波不侵犯條約成立、法國在東部的牽制策略、已减去了很大的作用、最近奥匈又和意大利特别親近、在政治上固然不見得有什麽了不得的大法術、但在經濟上、確是很新的運動、是法國於嚴防德意志之外、又要籌備如何對付意大利了、</p>
<p>當然、法國要牢牢的拉着英國、不過英國的傳統外交政策、是扶助歐洲兩大强國、當不肯過於助法抑德、因此法蘭西祗好轉變他舊時策略、不再加深對蘇聯的惡感、並且要乘勢接近蘇聯、法之反蘇、表面上一般所説的理由、是因爲主義的關係、因爲蘇聯主倡世界革命的關係、究其實、蘇聯從前對歐洲所估量的革命爆發地、也並不在法國、然則法國爲什麽會那樣的對蘇起反感呢、因爲自從［布里斯特、里特維斯克、］俄德條約成立後、德蘇之間、就很親近、同時德國在社會民主黨執政時代、又常常運用對蘇外交、以週旋於恊約國之間、而德蘇的貿易關係、又十分密切、據軍事密探的説法、德國且有將若干重要軍械在俄國境内製造的話、這話固然不見得眞實、但確足引動法國對德抑制因而對俄仇視的心理、於是法俄之間、總是存在着對立的狀態、再則俄國自十月革命以後、把戰前對法國六十四億四千萬金法郎的債欵、一槪否定不還、還有巴庫油田及其他重要産業中、法國私人的投資、一律没收了去、在蘇俄方面、以爲這是他天經地義最公平的舉動、在法國則以爲是侵奪了神聖不可侵犯的所有權、兩者相峙、於今十幾年了、依然擱在那裏没法子解决、</p>
<p>最近法蘇之間、却掃除了從前的隔閡、轉而入於親善的傾向、並且没有提到要解决以往經濟的懸案爲條件、照目前法國的情形講、卽使那些債欵、分文不償還、也於法國没有什麽大損害、可是他所最畏忌的敵人、如果站了起來的話、則法國的損失、當然更大、何况意大利又隠然自成一系統、也是反凡爾賽體系的、對國際聯盟、差不多是半退出的狀態、因此法國更不能不設法在歐洲尋找他國、適逢蘇聯放鬆世界革命的企圖、對德關係、又轉惡化、這纔盡量的與他拉攏、不消说這是削弱德國的聲勢、反之就是增加法國的外交援助、並且國際聯盟、還有請蘇聯加入的説法、而蘇聯並不曾拒绝、如果眞是實現了的話、則國際的糾紛、又將另現一種新局面了、（一九三四年三月二日於巴黎）</p>

<p>經濟與政治並進各國咸受其威脅</p>
<p>利用金錢作不利於我國之惡宣傳</p>
<p>巴黎通訊、九一八不但是中國歷史上的一個月日、實是世界史上的一個月日、從這時期以後、中國暫時失掉了東北四省、甚至北平六十里外變成了敵境、上海一部份繁華、作了灰燼、良藥苦口、在中國不能不説是一個起死回生的大教訓不過九一八的意義、不僅限於遠東這裏有一點先須注意的、就是歐洲人士就大體而論、對遠東情形、還是隔膜、當砲攻北大營的消息傳到歐洲時、歐洲一般人士誠如巴黎大學校長對記者所説、彷佛遭到晴天霹靂、後來惡耗迭至、更加深各國人民的驚異、然而東四省究竟去此地太遠了、其他國家且不論、連與中國最有關係的美俄、尚且困於境遇無力動作、所以日内瓦雖有决議、二三强權雖有警告、事實上説的儘管説、作的還是作、同情的儘管同情、受難的依舊受難、這樣世界經濟的危機、麻痺了列强的手足、中國徒靠他人、而毫無抵抗的實力、兩件事都給日本人看得清清楚楚、於是東四省成了今日的局面、這個局面除少數的新聞記者·外交官·旅行家·實業家·及眞具遠大眼光的政治家而外、一般的歐洲人、僅憑報紙的記载、是認識不明白的、换言之、在一般歐洲人的心目中、九一八的意義、若僅限於中國的喪失四省、那麽、九一八的意義、還是不够深刻的、因爲他們大多數對中日事件、實在是隔膜得很、何况歷年來（尤其是九一八以後）日本對外的宣傳、早把中國糟蹋到不成一個國家、使歐洲許多人、就令不信賴、至少也只好默認日本的行爲呢、</p>
<p>然九一八以後、另外有許多事情使歐洲人不能不注意、這些事情、因爲發生在九一八以後、因爲發生在歐洲更近的地方、因爲發生在歐洲本身所以歐洲人對它們漸漸感到切膚的利害、甚至由此漸漸感到九一八慘變發生當時卽具有、而當時因爲他們相距太遠、所以忽視了的東西、就是［日本的野心］我們對於歐洲人士這樣感覺的最好證據、便是莫索里尼今年正月發表的［東方暗雲］那篇文章、</p>
<p>表現這種野心的日本人、對歐洲的活動、可分作經濟的同政治的兩方面看、今先説經濟方面、凡在歐洲較久的人、都看得出兩三年來市面上日貨的充溢、且别説许多冒名的中國美術品中國瓷這一類的日貨、由來已久雖然魚目混珠識破的人漸漸多、然而爲價錢實在太賤、比巴黎倫敦各處古玩店陳列的眞正中國美術品中國瓷的價額、相去有　泥之别、所以買的人始終有、此外有一些物品、如樟腦之類、歐洲所不産的、因爲中國無力同日本競爭、甚至自己要買日本的、所以向來在歐洲市塲上由日本獨佔　權、也不自今日始、但新近兩三年來、歐洲市面上增加的日本貨、却不如此、巴黎的皮鞋店内、現在你一不留心、便會買着橡皮底的日本製運動鞋、鐘錶店内也會發現許多日本錶、吃食店内有裝璜精美而貨賤驚人的日本餅乾、這些食用品、並非英法所無的、不過因爲英法所製東西太好、所以價錢太貴、而世界經濟恐慌以來、一般英法人的購買力實在不及、反之、日本貨原價旣低、加以日幣外洪驟跌、大批傾銷貨物運動歐洲、就加上關税、而賣價還可以比各國本國物價便宜多多、所以有此結果、以上不過隨便舉幾個例、證明日貨漸漸侵略歐洲的數大市塲、巴黎倫敦的情形如此、其他中歐各國更不待説了、</p>
<p>日本在歐洲各地的經濟發達、單就上面所舉幾個顯著的例看來、已經够值得注意了、然此外有更使歐洲人驚異的、是近中東路一帶歐洲人視爲殖民地或勢力範圍内的日本活動、</p>
<p>月前大公報曾著論舉出日本同英國在澳洲經濟的衝突、日英對印度的經濟競爭、日趨險惡、也是世人周知的事實、在英國對日本的態度上、這些事實、有它們的嚴重的意義、同新加坡英國軍港的完成、兩相呼應、然而另有一些事實、世人比較大不知道、而因地理上距離歐洲愈近的關係、又因歷史上歐洲人對此另具一種心理的關係、它們格外使歐洲政治家·工商業家·乃至一般人民感到手忙脚亂、格外引起他們對［黃禍］的杞憂、這些事實、發生在紅海沿岸、尤其是發生在埃第阿皮國、</p>
<p>這個王國、位於菲洲東部及埃的南邊、面積百二十萬方基羅米突、人口一千一百萬强、歐洲列强、因爲它的产業還没發達、土地還待開墾、所以一向把它看作政治·經濟·兩方面利益的角逐塲、兩年半前光景、埃第阿皮國王海勒蕯拉傑第一加冕、各國都派使節致賀、日本也在内事後、埃第阿皮國王派員到日本來答禮、於是那時的首使現任的埃第阿皮國外交部長、就同日本政府開始了兩國間第一步工商業合作恊商、目的是獎勵日本工商業家到埃第阿皮國内敷處地方開發土地、並促進該國某地帶農工業的新發展這種恊商、是日本所希望的呢、還是埃第阿皮國所请求的呢、我們可以不管、總之談判結果、前年埃　阿皮國外交部長在東京同日本政府簽訂了一個有利於日本商業的新關税恊定、同時决定了卽速派遣一個由農業專家實業家同輸出貿易專家合組而成的技術專圑、去埃第阿皮國實地考察不久、埃政府就發表宣言、願意免税讓於日本移民六十頃左右的好地、作他們栽植棉花的充分的試騐、此外還有其他同樣性質的新工業樹立試騐用的特權的授與、這種試騐成功時、往下便更需日本技術的合作、去年這試騐時期、已經告一段落、日本人的經營、日趨利便、埃政府爲獎勵土地開墾、爲抵制歐洲製成品的輸入同提倡棉花及其他植物的培植起見、决意繼續大規模地容納日本實業家的請求、允許他們的移民、再加上埃王有意選一個日本女子作王妃、日本方面、又有黑田子爵的女等等應選、所以截至今日爲止、日本在埃第阿皮國的經濟活動、不能不説是很大的一個成功、</p>
<p>但在日本勢力未侵入之先、埃國的市塲、原來操在美國人手裏、後來英國人利用印度的棉紗、漸漸取美國而代之、所以埃第阿皮又成了英殖民地物産流銷的市塲、最近這種英國殖民地棉紗的輸入價額、還佔埃第阿皮海關統計約百分之五十左右、將來日本經營的紗廠等等在埃第阿　林立之後、這些英國殖民地的産品同歐洲其他列强的货物、在埃第阿皮就將完全繼絶銷路、（未完）</p>

<p>自右至左蔡孑民氏男女公子</p>
<p>黃任之女公子潘公展女公子</p>
<p>意、特規定一兒童節、故慈幼會亦於二十年三月間呈准國府定四月四日爲兒童節、所以今天的慶祝大會、亦可説是三周紀念、諸位小朋友是國家主人翁、對於國家之强弱、關係甚大、二十世紀爲兒童之世紀、欲挽救中國危亡、復興中華民國、非健全兒童不可、故今日慶祝兒童節、應唤醒國人愛護兒童、無論在體力上·智識上、務使其充分之發展、尤其是負教育責任者之教師·父母、至於一般貧苦與流流兒童、應請政府設法救濟與收容、使他們多能養成健全體格、愛國思想、</p>

<h3 id="c174">比國庚子賠欵 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>一·退欵之動機</p>
<p>比庚欵退還運動、實中法教育運動之一分支、民國二年李煜　氏與法人鐸爾孟創辦留法儉學會、介紹學生留法、其中有一部分人轉派比國留學、其後蔡元培·汪兆銘·李煜瀛及法國歐樂、穆岱、鐸爾孟諸人創辦華法教育會介紹赴比留學者日衆、尤以曉落槐工人大學爲最多、退欵興學之議、遂　塵上、</p>
<p>二·退欵之成熟時期</p>
<p>民國七年、全國教育界羣起作請各國退欵運動、時北方由北大校長蔡元培等發起、推派專員赴歐接洽、尤注意比國、西南亦委托汪兆銘、李煜瀛、張繼等赴歐調查教育、並專力於法比兩國之退欵、民八以後由北大駐歐通訊員褚民誼　續進行、適比京大學教授叙爾力贊退欵興學之議、曉露槐大學校長耶洛亦主與我國合辦中比大學、可請比政府補助經費並希翼退欵、民九褚民誼、蕭瑜再與耶洛商洽、在曉露槐勞働大學附近、勘定地點、建立中國學生寄宿舍、以爲樹立中比大學之基礎、尋蕭君歸國、言之於北大當局及中法大學駐京事務所、並報告教育總長范源廉、均得熱誠贊助、是年冬粤省政府捐助佛郎十二萬匯去、作爲中比大學開辦設備之用、民十湖南直隸兩省教育會發起全國學界聯合請願友邦退欵興學、連署者達四萬三千人、至十一年冬復推蕭瑜赴比代表投遞、我國駐比公使王景歧亦恊同鼓吹、未幾得比教長樂甫、外長察斯巴、殖民長富蘭克、國會議員德斯台、參政大臣兼國家银行總裁富蘭基等先後贊助、退欵之舉乃告成功、</p>
<p>三·中比换文恊定</p>
<p>至民國十四年北京政府與駐華比使幾度磋商、乃於是年九月五日中比兩國政府成立解决比國部分庚子賠欵换文、其内容大槪係由中國政府承認將自民國十四年九月一日起至民國廿九年十二月底止之比國部分庚欵餘額本金法金二千九百零五萬三千六百十一佛郎十五生丁、按照西曆一九○五年所採用之電匯方法計算、由華比銀行一次墊出交付比國政府、中國政府應飭知總税務司將自民國十四年九月一日起之關欵先行按月償還華比銀行墊欵、墊欵償清後卽以總税務司按月所付之欵交與中比委員會、充作中比教育慈善公共實業及公益工程之用、按照本恊定、所有由總税務司交付華比銀行之欵項應立美金總　券一張、其數目爲美金五百六十萬五千九百九十一元四角二分、（按此卽係中國政府欠付比國賠欵餘額純本之數）至分債劵開列本息總數則爲美金九百零四萬四千四百零二元六角八分、（按此卽係中國政府欠付比國賠欵餘額純本加入預計利息之數）前項應還華比銀行之墊欵至民國十六年五月間業已本息還清、是月份到期應付之庚欵尚餘美金二萬三千五百四十一元五角六分、</p>
<p>四·第二次中比恊定</p>

<h3 id="c175">英國庚子賠欵 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>一·退欵之動機</p>
<p>英庚欵退還之説、倡議較遲、約在大戰之後、是時英政府（一）鑒於美國退欵辦理教育之成效昭著、（二）受大戰期内恊約國允許我國停付賠欵五年之影響、（三）感於我國朝野希翼退欵之熱誠、乃有將庚欵退還中國用諸兩國互利事業之意、民國七年左右、留英學生王雪艇·梁龍·任凱南·陳源等刋發請英退欵小册、並向英政府國會及教育界接洽、各方多表同情、國内教育界適有同標運動、並委托赴歐考察戰後教育之陶孟和等向英游説、自是英國人士如羅素·路易士·介爾斯等、多有撰文刋載英國報紙雜誌鼓吹之者、社會遂加注意、</p>
<p>二·退欵之成熟時期</p>
<p>民國十一年、留英學生組織退欵興學委員會、以楊子余爲主席、陳寳諤爲秘書、張道藩·鄧又生·黃建中·劉兆銘·潘紹棠等爲委員、聯絡國内外共同進行、初、彼等僅撰文演説、編印小册、向英國國會議員教育界新聞界宣傳、繼則邀请我國旅歐教育名流蔡孑民赴英鼓吹、蔡氏抵倫敦後、以駐英代辦朱兆莘曁全體留英學生之恊助、更與英國朝野作有力之接洽、並在英人主辦之中國恊會（ＣhinaＳociety）演説［中國教育之發展］問題、極言新中國不久勃興、需要科學教育甚切、希望英人予以道德的與經濟的（指退欵興學）援助、對於英國國會方面、並提出意見書、明言退欵宜用於教育以作永久性質之紀念、旋蔡氏至利物浦一帶復作同一呼籲、甚得英國朝野人士之贊同、十一年冬、英政府正式宣言、中國應付未到期之庚欵、卽將退還中國、作爲教育文化及其兩國互利事業之用、嗣因英國國會舉行改選、内閣迭有變更、事遂擱置、迨至十四年六月英國國會始正式通過［中國賠欵案］、此事至此得完全確定、旋以關於用途有先行研究之必要、乃成立諸詢委員會、計有委員十一人、英居其八、華居其三、十五年該委員會復組織代表圑、以威林頓勳爵、安迪生女爵士、蘇梯爾教授與丁文江·胡適·三景春三氏爲圑員、至我國南北各地調查並徵集退疑用途之意見、同年杪該代表圑造具報告及建議書、内容甚重要、其後兩國　文卽以此爲根據、</p>
<p>三·中央　文恊定</p>
<p>十九年九月中英兩國正式簽訂换文、卽將自十一年十二月一日起應付之英庚欵交還中國政府管理、我國政府贊同將此欵盡數參照諮詢委員會代表圑之意見、作爲教育文化事業之基金、共後計劃稍變、將現存及將到期之庚欵之一部借充整理及建築中國鐵路及其他生産事業之用、以其息金用於教育文化事業、當採納諮询委員會之建議、組織董事會以司管理支配該全部庚欵之職權、我國政府並將現存之欵全部移交於設立在倫敦之購料委員會、以便向英國工廠購買橋樑·機車·車輛·鋼軌及他種材较、充中國國有鐵路與他項生産事業之用、當規定自民國十一年十二月一日起至二十年四月止退欵已積存三百五十萬四千一百二十二鎊七先令七便士、由董事會附屬之倫敦中英庚欵購料委員會保管、至陸續到期之庚欵、則由駐華英公使以一半交該會、一半交倫敦購料委員會、</p>
<p>四·英庚欵退還總數及其借用支配原則英庚欵應退還之總數共爲一、一八六、五四七鎊一二先令、利息在内、每年到期庚欵多少不一、本年度約五九六、四八一鎊、其借用支配原則、已由中央政治會議規定、以三分之二借充建築及整理鐵道之用、三分之一借作　利電氣等建設事業之用（此三分之一、分作導淮委員會百分之四十、廣東治河委員會百分之二十、其餘百分之四十爲（一）興辦電氣事業、（二）辦理黃河水利、（三）興辦基本工業、各得三分之一）、借欵週年利息五厘、</p>
<p>五·撥充教育文化事業經費之數目</p>
<p>英庚欵實行退還未久、借給各機關欵項無多、其利息尚不敷以施用於教育文化事業、至息金用途支配標凖則已定有二原則（一）以用於有永久紀念性之教育文公之建築及有關全國之重要文化事業爲原則、不得用以輔助任何機關之經常費及臨時費、（二）應兼顧中央及全國各文化中心爲適當之支配、務使事業集中、效果普及、以補充國内教育文化之缺點、</p>
<p>六·董事會組織</p>
<p>英庚會名爲管理中央庚欵董事會、董事十五人、中國占三分之二、英國占三分之一、由中國國民政府選派、隸屬於行政院、其任期爲三年、第一任爲一年二年三年各五人、以抽籖定之、董事長一人、由中國政府指定、副董事長一人、由董事互選其職務爲管理並分配英國退還庚欵、董事會開會須經過半數董事出席、其决議案應由出席董事過半數之贊成方爲有效、</p>
<p>七·現任董事人選</p>
<p>中國方面爲朱家驊·李書華·李四光·葉恭綽·劉瑞恒·宋子良·陳其采·曾鎔浦·曾養甫·顔德慶、英國方面爲休士·馬錫爾·康德康·端納·卜隆、朱家驊兼董事長、馬錫爾兼副董事長、</p>
<p>八·最近英庚欵支配狀况</p>
<p>英庚欵近來借與國内鐵道、水利、電氣及其由建設事業、爲數不多、所得回息金、迄至上年杪、只有國幣五十餘萬金元、故尚未開始支配、據管理中英庚欵董事會最近送到預算書只有派遣留英公費生經費一種、其總數爲國幣二二九、○○○元、此外卽係該會日常開支、餘未動用、</p>

<p>它利用青年期的好動傾向、合羣傾向、　　傾向、導引他以人於積極爲善努力向上的一途、</p>
<p>童子軍最先成立於一九○八年、（卽民元前四年）迄今不過二十餘年、而世界已有童子軍二百萬人以上、且最近各國訓練青年之方式亦都似脱胎於此、</p>
<p>童子軍是英國民族對於教育上的一大貢獻、巴敦博威公爵雖然没有教育　論的專箸、但他對於教育、乃能有此種透闢之見解、無怪斯乃遯博士（哥崙比亞大學教育學教授）常嘆爲［教育的天才］也、我想他對青年期教育之貢獻、其偉大殆將不亞於福祿倍爾之於初等教育、</p>
<p>我於此有二個希望</p>
<p>（一）中學校的教育應采取其全部精神與一部方法、這便是［生活的教育］、這是韽創造［新生活］新民族的教育、</p>
<p>（二）假如有辦法、能够推廣到農工商　各青年、以簡單便宜的服裝、如有意義的訓練、當是民族的福利吧、卽使此時祇中可作理想、而實現理想、似宜作爲服務童子軍者及從事社會教育事業者之一個鵠的、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>青島市長沈鴻烈氏，南下考察建設教育及國貨事業，道經上海，市商會與各國貨圑體熱烈歡迎、以謀青滬兩市工商事業的合作，記者也曾追隨國貨界諸同志，觀光青島，很敬佩沈市長關心國貨事業之進展，以繁榮青島市爲職志。去年之夏，在沈市長領導下之青島市國貨展覽會開幕，營業的發達，打破各省市空前的紀錄。我們也曾親聆沈市長惓惓贊助國貨的盛意，因上以後，便打動青滬國貨界領袖舉辦事業的興趣。青地丁君敬臣，劉君子山，王君新三，旣發起青島國貨公司，同時方君液仙，蔡君聲白，任君士剛，方君劍閣，李君祖模胥君仰南等，合辦國貨工廠山東聯合營業所，均得沈市長之贊助，以有今日成功。故不但青島工商界感其熱忱，卽上海國貨界均佩其好意，這是最最值得歡迎的。王君曉籟，謂［今日滬商以青島爲銷貨區者，似當更進一步以青島爲投資區］。此語記者極端贊同，深望今年夏天，我國貨界與金融界界重到青市，謀盡國貨事業之建設，以青市爲金融國貨界投資之區，［遏制日人之侵略，開發青市之富源，這是我們尤其希望的。</p>
<h3 id="c197">［婦女國貨年］的春季 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>［一年之計在於春］，古人早已明明白白的告訴我們，無論那種事業的進展，都須預定一個嚴密的計劃於春天，然後在這一年中，可以依着這固定的程序，絡續努力，到達到最後的目的爲止，自然這雖是寥寥的幾句話，但對於我們國貨事業的進展，却正是一個很好的借鏡。</p>
<p>我們很深切地知道在這歷史的過去，高入雲霄的提倡國貨聲浪，到現在已是第二個年頭，｜由國貨年到婦女國貨年，在這短短的過程裏，因爲我們努力的結果，它也已有了相當成績的表现，事業昭示着，我們可單以一條平素充滿着洋氣的南京路來講，以前是舶來品充斥的大本營，現在却已有了五六家國貨的商塲，尤以中國國貨公司，爲最完備偉最大的成了［國貨之總庫］，受大衆的愛護與擁戴，其他，如市商會主辦的北市國貨商塲，日昨聞又有南市國貨商塲的開幕，猗歟盛哉！國貨福音，凡此種種，無不給予我們很好的印象，可是，從另一方面講，去年［九萬萬元的入超新紀錄］這次，［美國提高銀價，企圖傾銷］，覺得我們過去樹立的基礎，還嫌不够，大有擴展未來的必要，現在，我敢以個人的意見所及，提出二點竭誠的希望，貢獻於我國貨業界管理當局，能及早計劃及施行。</p>
<p>（一）籌設各地國貨公司潘仰堯先生在前幾期本刋上，曾提出過一張籌設各地中國國貨公司名單，並詳列其營業總額及資本數目，我們在此最短期間，將如何能使其一一實現，俾組成全國國貨之網，使熱烈的提倡國貨呼聲，不僅祗限於都市一隅，並且要普遍地推行到内地｜各個農村裏去。</p>
<p>（二）確定本市國貨組織現在滬上全市國貨銷售機關，雖已不少，但對於其營業範圍及區域，如有加以合理規定之必要，以冀得更收［事半功倍之效果，當然，勿使叢集一處，及便利各處居民就近購買兩點，尤宜注意，而我人此後之目標，應在虹口或閘北，滬西等地，似宜繼續成立，蓋適合上列兩項原則也。</p>
<p>值此明媚春光，正是我人致力事業之候，何况提倡國貨，是責有攸歸，不容旁貸，我們將如何抱着使命，認清責任，並及早作規定合理化之計劃，努力邁進，得與蘇聯之五年計劃，先後嫓美，而在此［婦女國貨年］中，獲得最大之效果。</p>
<h3 id="c198">國貨運動失敗的原因在那裏？ <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 楊運</p>
<p>無論那一種運動，才上來總不免要藉用宣傳的力量以爲發端，但盛大的宣傳之下，社會上起而響應的自然日漸加多，隨後就要有一套有系統的富有確實性的詳細内容辦法公諸大衆，使這種運動在實行的時候，能一絲不亂的向前做着，能實在的發生效力，這種運動的本身才愈堅强而有力：不然則宣傳効力雖然很大，鄉應的雖然很多，但做的時候就感覺空泛難得實在的辦法。有心的感到彷徨，苦闷：敷衍的就甘於以盲從盲，互相欺詐。其結果或在社會上徒留着一種形式，或並形式亦不易保持而運動終於無效。</p>
<p>我們的國貨運動，雖不自今日始，但降及今日可謂盛極一時了，什麽國貨年呀，婦女國貨年呀，什麽演講呀，遊行呀，做了不少宣傳發端的工作，這未始不是好的現象，不過因爲實施的方案方面，尚少切實的具體的辦法，致運動結果，由入超五萬萬元增至七萬萬元，大失我們所望。所以個人希望國貨界，今後須注意切實的辦法，以收運動之實效。</p>
<p>怎樣的辦法才算是切實有效？這是一言難盡的問題，個人不敏，對此亦不過槪述其原則罷了。其原則維何？</p>
<p>（一）政府要有提倡國貨挽回利源的决心，所有國貨運動的命令，應切實的考查民衆是否遵行？嚴加獎懲，萬不可以一紙空文，就算完了責任。</p>
<p>（二）各界民衆領袖應恊助政府考查民衆遵行的成績，隨時報告政府，在自身更應以身作則。</p>
<p>（三）工商各界應有相互監督的條理，化除狼狽爲奸的惡根性。</p>
<p>（四）服用民衆方面，第一步由各地教育機關，盡開導的責任；第二步由各縣區特設調查機關，切實考查，以憑懲處。</p>
<h3 id="c199">對於國貨應有的認識 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>提倡國貨原不是憑着喊喊口號，貼貼標語就有用的；也不是跟着大家呌幾聲［國貨年］［婦女國貨年］，就算盡了責任。其實，吾們並不需要這種空虚的口頭裝飾品｜好聽的名詞。吾們大家應該起來實地去幹才是，去幹吾們應幹的愛國工作；愛國工作的第一步，便應提倡國貨。</p>
<p>自從世界不景氣的浪潮打入了中國以後，吾們的國家財政也竭蹶到了這般田地；商業市塲的破産，農村經濟的崩潰，事實上已使中國前途入於風雨飄摇的時期。尤其是國貨事業的不振；一方面遭受外貨的經濟侵略，一方面又爲國人的購買减低，無形之中受了這二重壓迫，於是，國貨事業就一落千丈不堪凋零了。</p>
<p>而且，吾國民衆，一向愛好舶來品的心理太重，所以一般現代的摩登人物，無論是男是女，其衣食住行一切都崇尚了洋化。據各方面調查所得，吾國每年輸出的産品，和輸入的外貨相比較，牠的數目實在要使人撟舌而不能下！</p>
<p>吾們不談救國則已，乾脆讓人家去説［冷血動物］，［亡國奴預備隊］。要谈救國則須先愛國；愛國之道就是提倡國貨，抵制外貨。然而，吾們要來提倡國貨，還得先要認清了立塲，抱定了宗旨，對國貨的内容至少要加以深切的認識。這，决不是抱出風頭主義，全憑嘴吧上喊喊就算了事的。像這種不澈底的，虚僞的觀念，應該先要排除，不然這效果是等於零的；因爲，這正是提倡國货闪途的一個絶大屏障。</p>
<p>本來，提倡國貨的責任，凡是國民一份子，誰都應該有的；所謂［國家興亡，匹夫有責］，也就是這個道理。吾希望那些愛用外國貨的時髦朋友，摩登女子，不要再儘管地醉心外國貨了，赶快拿一份良心來愛國吧！</p>
<p>最後，吾自己抱定宗旨，在可能範圍以内，一切都採用國貨；（一）不説外國貨好，（二）不談國貨壞，（三）鼓勵自己的家人兒女愛用國货，（四）勸導自己的親戚朋友提倡國貨，（五）只要吾認爲滿意的都得用牠。同時，吾但願吾們的國人，也都對於國貨加以深切的認識，和儘量的提倡。</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>禮，義，廉，恥，的新生活運動，絢爛極了！自從南昌發軔，遍及全國，可是不儉樸自己的生活，緊縮自己的生活程度，怎談得到禮，義，廉，恥，呢？</p>
<p>要儉樸自己的生活，該先提倡國貨，購用國貨始！新生活公約中，衣的方面，第九項［衣服要用國貨］，也就是實行新生活勿忘國貨！</p>
<p>孔聖人曾經這樣説：［非禮勿視，非禮勿聽，非禮勿言，非禮勿動，］現在的東，西，洋貨，好比媚人的妖女，｜狐狸精｜吮血吸膏，弄得一個大好中國，面黃肌瘦｜形銷骨立｜實行新生活後，希望國人對於非國貨，勿視，勿聽，勿言，勿動，這纔是［禮］呢！</p>
<p>［舍身取義］［義不苟同］我們提倡國貨，應該摩頂放踵，義不容辭，人人抱衆醉獨醒，義不苟同之旨，所謂［信義通商］售國貨，用國貨，信國貨，這纔是［義］呢！</p>
<p>［儉以養廉］［嚴潔奉公］這是人人應該有的美德！寗願儉樸購國貨，廉潔培養國本，勿使利權外溢，纔可稱之謂［廉］呢！</p>
<p>［明恥教戰］［知恥近乎勇］可是國家不爭氣，重重的恥辱，對外無作戰的能力！知恥勇於内戰，勇於買仇貨，眞眞令人萬分痛心！還有那無恥奸商，認賊作父，拿同胞的錢，求亡自己的祖國，眞是惡貫滿盈，罪通於天了，親愛的同胞，我們再不肅清奸商，屏除東西的舶來，那恥辱將會弄到經濟滅國，家破人亡！所以［知恥］速用國貨！［明恥］速谋對付奸商，和對付我們的敵人，恥買仇貨！恥與奸商爲伍！這才是知［恥］呢！　　總括一句話，［禮，義，廉，恥，］四字，先從自己本位［提倡國貨］做起！</p>
<h3 id="c201">女教師在婦女國貨年中的使命 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 酉之</p>
<p>教育的對象是學生，而擔負這個教育責任的是教師，教師的一言一語，一舉一動，直接影響了學生，間接又影響了整個社會，因爲教育是離不開社會的，一面是指導社會，一面是改進社會。所以，我們認爲教師是處於領導羣衆的地位，不但要以身作則去做兒童的表率，並且要進一步切實地去做羣衆的導師。這樣，纔能達到教育的遠大的目的，也纔算教師盡了責任！</p>
<p>在轟轟烈烈的提倡國貨聲中，固然有待全國同胞上下一心的努力，但教師們的責任却眞不小，一方面要宣傳國貨運動的意義，另一方面要澈底改造愛用洋貨的劣根性。教師又可説是深入民間的人，當然比較容易下手，將來收效必宏！</p>
<p>今年是婦女國貨年，當然是偏重於婦女國貨運動，這裏就是表明過去婦女界用了不少洋貨，現在要大大地轉一個正當的方向｜採用國貨。這眞是一件偉大的工程呀！全國婦女們需要怎樣的努力，以冀實現：當然，女教師們要負起更偉大的使命了！這是誰也不能否認的！中國女子教育没有發達到相當階叚，知識程度幼稚，這是一般的現象。而女教師是知識分子，可謂鶴立鷄羣，她們之應處於領導婦女同胞們的地位，那是再適合也没有的了，眞可作爲婦女界的表率啊！因此，我們認爲女教師是婦女國貨年的急先鋒，要是她們能認識了自己的地位，以身作則，婦女國貨運動的前途，一定充滿着無限的光明！</p>
<p>如果女教師們的腦袋裏，只是充塞着洋化，衣料，裝飾，日用品，惟洋货是求，這是［洋八股式的教育］害了她們，，無異是一種自殺自滅的政策！不但於社會國家毫無裨益，並且是個害羣之馬了！我可以舉一個例子，某處鄉村小學内有一位女教師，總算與地方上感情不壞，一般鄉婦村姑，時常與她爲伴，漸漸地受了這女教師的影響，頭髮剪除了，臉上塗起雪花膏，衣服做起洋布的長旗袍，這樣一來，儼然似改頭换面，十足地變成了摩登姑娘了，我覺得這女教師的力量眞大，説不定在最近的將來，那些村姑和這女教師一樣畫眉塗宼丹穿高跟鞋呢！自然，這裏有好處：也有壞處，但究竟壞處比好處多過幾倍呢！女教師簡直成了模範的洋貨推銷員了！從至高無上的清高地位降到卑賤没落的慘境中，這是理所不該有的吧：</p>
<p>退一步説：教師之所以稱教師，因爲他能教導兒童，兒童心理有可型性，我們務必把他們養成好習慣，將來能够獻身國家，做一個好公民。如果訓練成熟了，根本上不需在他們成人時再來一個國貨運動了！而女教師教導之下的學生，豈非照着這個共同的目標而走！那不是應該提倡國貨麽？</p>

<p>兒童在婦女國貨年裏，受母親或姊姊愛用國貨的薰陶，小朋友們小小的腦筋裏，也會印着要用國貨的極好印象！</p>
<p>卽如我的兒女，小小年紀，已曉得買國貨要到中國國貨公司裏去買，所以我希望一般女同胞，你們要希望小國民起來轟轟烈烈的做事，爲國家雪恥，復興中華，該先灌漑一般小國民愛用國貨的根苗，那才會有實現的希望呢！</p>
<p>這篇短文，我寫在兒童節之後，就是使同胞們不要凑熱閙於一時，而冷淡於日後，要時時刻刻的注意着啊！</p>

<p>（一）遍地金沙</p>
<p>春天，桃花像爭妍鬥勝地在北平城内城外，到處開放着；一陣風過，落花滿地，彷彿是舖上了一條緋色的地毯一樣；空氣中，隨時可以聞着别的花的一股濃烈的香味。</p>
<p>某一條街上，　地舖着金子一般的黃沙，大隊的人馬，浩浩蕩蕩地在前進。行列極整齊而嚴肅，除掉人馬在沙地上踐踏，發出輕碎的沙沙聲以外，旁的便聽不見什麽了。</p>
<p>許多盛裝華服的人，跨着馬、戴着有貂尾做裝飾的朝帽，組成了一隊光輝爘爛的隊伍。他們座下的馬都是最好的蒙古種，光滑的毛片，長而整齊的　毛，時時發出耀眼的光來。馬鞍上都鑲着珍貴的珠寳，脚蹬上也有很好看的整飾。平均每一匹馬的身上，至少有四五種不同的顔色，幾百匹聚在一起，再加上了陽光的反映，使蔚爲奇觀，爘若雲錦了！</p>
<p>在這些馬所踢起來的灰塵的後面，相距約一二十步，有一乘全部放着金子的光彩折大轎。轎子的兩邊，畫着兩條張牙舞爪的金龍。拾轎的是十六名太監。在這座轎子的裏面，像廟宇裏所塑的神道一般，端然不動地坐着的，便是當時的皇太后，慈禧｜中國四萬萬人民的主宰者。（三）</p>

<p>蘇州的花市，可説是［自昔稱盛］了。倘然坐下行車車來，可以瞧見虎邱山塘，許多花棚，上面蓋着蘆簾，下面藏着花。要是天晴氣和，簾捲花呈，雖然聞不到香味，好像香味已撲上車廂來了。</p>
<p>還有住在阿黛橋邊的旅舍裏，到了清晨，常有粥粥羣雌，挽着筠籃賣白蘭花的，使你曉夢不寗，閒情欲寄，這也見得蘇州的花市，［至今不襄］了。</p>
<p>説起梅花，自然鄧尉是老資格，香雪海三字時常繚繞在人們的腦際，可是近年爲了梅子的出産有限，多改種桑樹，眞的滄海變了桑田，遠不如無錫之盛。倒是後起之秀的張家花園，尚有大塊文章可看。此外冷香閣，可　，雖都有一點，不過附庸之國，偏安之局而已。</p>
<p>李印老家裏有一盆梅椿，是從安徽來的，幹圍七八寸，欹立如醉，從頂上斜出花枝，好像風吹秀髮，纷披芬芳，令人陶醉。徐澐秋先生恰巧在側，就從身邊取出一張影片來給我看，光景差不多，不過屈曲蟠結，更見蒼古，説是名畫家顧鶴逸先生的遺物。鶴逸在日，有一個日本畫家見了，願出銀五百兩買他，鶴逸不肯，日本畫家就攝了影還去，印在他的遊記上，説他至少有一百年的壽命。</p>
<p>今年我家玉蘭花，開得獨盛，總在五百左右，微風摇白，暖日映光，眞覺得莊嚴爘爛，倘然用西方文字來形容，稱他聖潔，是最切當没有了。</p>

<p>桂枝點點頭，也没有作聲。江氏道：你睡罷，别胡想什麽了。桂枝也正是怕母親不放心，點了頭低聲道：我這就睡，今天晚上凉着呢，説着，伸手來解自己衣服的鈕扣。而且朦朧着眼睛，還打了兩個呵欠，表示他十足的要睡。江氏看他情形如此，自然也就不再説什麽，替他順手帶上房門，悄悄的走了。桂枝將房門關上了，走到桌子邊去，便也想移燈就寢。因爲燈邊有一面鏡子，心想，我臉上掛着什麽愁容嗎？怎麽母親會看出我的心事來呢？於是又坐了下來，兩手捧了鏡子，對着自己的臉，很近的靠了燈照着。這回算是把臉上的容顔看清楚了，原來兩隻眼睛，由外到裏，都是紅紅的，而且自己那圓圓的臉腮，這時竟會撑出兩塊顴骨來，决不是作新娘子時候，那樣水葱兒似的皮膚，桃花瓣的顔色了。自己看看自己的影子，又抬頭看看壁上懸的相片，情不自禁的，又歎出氣來了。忽然江氏在窗户外道：姑奶奶，你説了睡覺的，怎麽又不睡了呢？接着趙翁也道：是呀，天氣怪凉的，可别凍了。桂枝這才明白，兩位老人家都還没睡呢，這就答道：我這就睡了，我這就睡了。他答應了話，也眞個上床去睡覺。但是不要睡，而勉强去睡，那更睡不着，結果是躺在枕上，更胡思亂想起來。這一晚的幻想，可和桂枝種下了無數的愁根，而將來的變化，也是桂枝自己所想不到的呢。（三五四）</p>

<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>當寂寞的深夜，我總愛走到那莊嚴的黃浦江邊，在碼頭上，在和平神像下，在街樹的陰影裏，孤獨地徘徊着。</p>
<p>今夜没有月，没有風，黃色的微波靜靜地流，江面披上了迷濛的夜色，船艦埋在濃烟裏，亮亮的燈火像眼珠子似的閃耀着：水上映着燈的影，一點點，一條條，像滿天的尾，像灣曲的金蛇。</p>
<p>江水浩蕩地展開去，浦東像一座孤島似的浮在上面；洋棧上的高烟突没有烏烟的噴射，如同一個人停止了呼吸死去啦！</p>
<p>從那黑暗的，遼遠的邊緣，市渡輪的紅燈現出來了，卜通卜通地，載着幾個乘客，氣喘喘的駛來：在夏夜，它是多麽華麗，把紅綠的小電燈串成了一根彩帶，爘爛地圍繞在身上，抱着許多乘凉的貴客，唱着無綫電的流行的歌曲，踏着狐步舞的姿態，在江面上像輕燕一般飄飛，渡輪呵！那時，你曾經迷醉過多</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>歙硯槪况</p>
<p>（一）歙與端的評議歙石硯出徽州婺源龍尾山，據新安志説，唐開元中獵人葉氏，逐獸至長城，見疊石瑩潔，携歸作硯，温潤過端溪，持獻令，至南唐元宗時，歙守上此石於朝，並薦硯工李少微，擢硯官，歙硯之名，自此大著。硯譜又説李後主所用澄心堂紙，李廷珪墨，龍尾石硯，三者爲天下冠，史上傳爲美談。蓋斯時端溪硯尚未著名，故論者獨推重歙，迨其後端溪下巖石，採掘漸多，贊美端之下巖者日衆，於是論硯者遂分成兩派，一則説歙石之堅勁發墨勝於端，一則説端石之温潤細密勝於歙，各執一説，吾人平心而論，二者各有佳處。硯林拾遺説：龍尾如清寒道人，時見機頴，端石如風流學士，竟體朗潤，這論最爲公允。歐陽修與蘇東坡，皆愛重此品，因歙之龍尾與端之北璧石潤膩同如　鎜塌蠟也。可惜龍尾舊坑，至北宋卽已廢塞，以後新坑所出，總不如舊坑的佳，而端溪之下巖，則愈採愈精，新坑反勝於舊坑，此所以造成端石獨一之地位。</p>
<p>（二）歙石分五品歙硯石品，據唐衡銓硯説，分爲五類，大抵皆堅勁瑩潤發墨，以有金星而斑顯鮮明，爘如泥金者爲貴。最上者其形如龍尾，謂之龍尾金星，若散布如花瓣落滿者次之。凡有金星者，石色必帶綠，除金星外，其他或紋如蘆花，或如織羅樣，或如眉毛；或如刷絲；紋皆白色，隠隠如銀，此四種爲次，（但佳者亦甚難得）至於無紋之石，亦非盡是普通石，有一種石理微　，手摩之索索有鋒鋩，故甚落墨，亦是佳者，以上就石品分别之。</p>
<p>（三）舊坑與新坑，硯説又稱龍尾舊坑，亦是卵石難得大者，色淡青黑，湛如秋水，並無紋，以水浸之，似微紫，而細潤如玉，或隠隠有白紋，成山水墨牛星月異象，乾則隠，發墨如油無聲，久用不退鋒。或有純黑如角者貴，南唐時舊坑有之，今則已無。新坑色亦青黑無紋，而　燥礪墨退筆，久則鈍乏，其他羅紋等舊坑　品，皆青黑色，貴重不减龍尾，若新坑四品，比舊坑枯燥，紋亦較粗，又説：金星新舊坑均粗燥，色亦淡青黑，有星處不堪磨墨，工人多側取之，而置星於外，謂之金星墻壁，銀星新舊坑，（面上多白點如粟米大爲银星）亦淡青黑，粗燥與金星同，以上就新舊坑分别之。</p>
<p>少男女貴客，可是，當你溜走了青春的時代，卸去了美麗的裝飾，就没有許多男女貴客來投入你們懷抱裏了！</p>
<p>我對着那冷寞的渡輪，輕輕的太息起重機的鐵鏈還在碼頭上轆轆地震響着，苦工們的　悶的　喝聲，和着懷鄉的水手的歌聲，合奏一支伏爾加船夫曲。</p>

<p>一五五包</p>
<p>本市紗布交易所倉庫中存紗、各廠解進日增、市面受其重大壓迫、故邇來市價慘落、四月份標紗發現民十以來之新低峯、曾見一百六十七元九角、較三月十五日最高價爲一百八十五元、跌去十七元一角、而四月份標花爲四十二元三角、祇跌去一元三角半、兩相比較、足見廠方之困難矣、申新廠鑒於紗賤花貴之苦、本有一度收買、目召集各廠圑結維持、無奈各廠祇顧目前利益、仍將各紗紛紛解入倉庫中、於是申新廠視局勢不良、將四萬包之額掃數忍痛了結、此日商造謡由來也、查至三月三十一號截止計有三萬六千一百五十五包、茲將内容列表如左、</p>

<p>標凖春假停市</p>
<p>現紗花客銷仍滯</p>
<p>紗市塲、標紗因春假停市、棉紗現貨商稍有到市集會、但交易仍屬零星、各帮皆無大量的胃口、故人心平澹、惟美印棉市稍漲、然仍難引起客銷、實係金融太枯耳、查全日各帮買去統計祇一百零六包、午後無市、各帮買額如下、</p>

<p>棉市依然暗澹、人氣涣散、但美印棉上漲、惟本埠紗市袞敗、廠方困難、對於原料進　頗滯、故市面愈疲云、</p>
<p>美棉始跌終漲</p>
<p>昨日美棉市况、始因外商賣出而跌、後以空頭抵補及華爾街有力回漲、結果現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲一磅音至七磅音、利物浦棉現貨漲六點、期貨跌三點、埃及棉現貨漲三點、孟買棉市、因歐洲出口商掉期賣出七月份而漲、結果平加爾漲三羅比、奥姆辣漲一羅比七角半、白羅溪漲四羅比、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>

<p>（滬南）各帮來四十餘號（六千餘石）、市况初以天時陰暗、售方喊聲頗高、人心亦稍定、繼則天雨濛濛、形勢帶緊、但白雲變幻、殊難度測、霎時又忽轉晴、因之曇花美景、悉化泡影、反呈帶軟之勢、青角·松泗·西練等晚稻、雖南洋帮停辦、而北洋帮獨進二千四五百包、行情無甚上落、常帮蘇同南港等厚粳、城鄉店胃先强後衰、依舊平常、市價與前相仿、杜羊尖供求相合、其價亦照舊盤、陰變元平平而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到埠二十餘號、市銷因清晨卽雨、致做開無幾、同行均未開斛、市形堅定、</p>

<p>中次秈續漲五分</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、人心依然望好、因産價高昂、貨主均接到産地限定價格、不肯輕脱、對於高格各米一律喊大二角、而進户嫌大、槪不問津、中次各擋、存到較多、且有長江江北各地新到、市價不能扳足、昨日因　胃之活、亦漲起五六分、惟有本市行家及漢帮已在長沙直接租定一淺水輪、完全裝載湘米、由湘直抵上海、大約在日上卽可到申、因此貸主對於中次各秈並不如高貨之扳俏、全市開出五千五百八十八包、由温州去二百二十四包、本街去四百包、其餘統爲閩省帮福州辦去、</p>
<h3 id="c230">黃豆去化較前遜色 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>

<p>— 善之</p>
<p>近來有民俗學者，考證出鬼神的迷信，不盡由心理而生，大半是由物質環境造成的。北方生活艱難，有嚴冬酷暑，不由得人民不趨重物質，南方則自然環境較好，可以使生活有閒，於是可以讓精神多活動，社會上則産生了一班方術之士，專在人叢中搗鬼，吳，楚，古來便多淫祀。</p>
<p>然而幾個善堂或同善社是將人民的迷信提倡不起來的，倘若人民對於鬼神没有需要，對於迷信没有傳統的根基。中國是［神道設教］，神鬼原來有客觀的物質作用的，并非主觀的有何靈應或神通。</p>
<p>其故何也？大槪簡單的説起來，一班人生活不如己意，有情無處申，有寃無處訴，［打不起官司告不起狀］，結果是只得怨天地，求鬼神，拿了對方到城隍廟去請菩薩評理。古時［詛盟］之類，也如此的！</p>
<p>善必賞，惡必罰，或則延壽若干紀，或則禍及子孫，這種種因果之説，也許是對於這民族有價值的吧皆附麗於鬼神。但［有道之世，其鬼不神］，鬼神之作，大抵在亂離時代。有許多人以爲近數年佛化盛行，是［民心思洽］之現象，而不知這正是［民心思亂］的表徵，時局不平安，人民失去了自信力，無樂生之情，在無可奈何中，只得希望他生，凈土，天堂，而求助於冥冥中之鬼神了。</p>
<p>試想四萬萬人中間不怕鬼的有幾個？各地的祠堂，廟宇，何等普通！尤其像春秋，南北朝的現代，那麽牛神蛇鬼，焉得不出來逛逛［大世界］，散散心！當然，這是鬼神的大有爲之世了。古人［放下屠刀，立地成佛］；今人［放下佛經，又執屠刀］。軍閥劇盜，入廟門則頓首，出廟門則殺人，亂離愈甚，鬼神也愈盛！</p>
<p>蒲松齡善於説鬼，王漁洋有詩道：［姑妄言之妄聽之，豆棚瓜架雨如絲，（按：此鬼境也！）料應厭説人間事，愛聽秋墳鬼唱詩！］｜大槪他也不甚聊生，看鬼世界也許還比人世界好！</p>
<h3 id="c235">清明 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 稻子</p>
<p>干戈擾攘的故鄉，好幾年没有回去過了。在這萬惡的都市中，只要一無聊，故鄉的那種花明柳暗的景片，總搶先展開在我的眼前，靠着茂林修竹的青山，延伸着綠油油的一片麥田，順着麥田過去，又是兩岸垂楊夾着一溪缓缓的春水。在這兒常常可以看見一些幽閒的漁翁，背着一　的陽光蹲在那麽得溜光的石邊垂釣。柳葉下嗡嗡的黃　，差不多要催人入睡了。呵，那是多麽和平的鄉村，那是多麽安靜的樂土！</p>
<p>從前清明時節，我同弟弟跟着母親來這兒上墳的時候，一在父親的碑前把頭磕過，跑到佃户的家裏去，一羣熟識的光脚板的孩子就來圍着我們，熱烈地拿茶拿烟，用着詫異的眼光望着我同弟弟身上的緞馬褂。我同弟弟閙着要釣魚去的時候，那些孩子們就笑嘻嘻地搶着拿魚竿的拿魚竿，拿笆簍的拿笆簍。母親是怕我們跌下水去的：可是那些孩子的父親們都説［不怕的，不怕的，］爲了使母親放心，他們還特派了一個年青强壯的漢子保護我們去。記得那强壯的漢子還拍着胸膛這麽説着：［我呌水生，水是不要緊的，有我！］我們就蜂子朝王似的圍着水生一擁的跑到溪邊去了。釣着幾條魚的時候，我們想今天有新鮮魚吃了。可是一跨進水生的家門，客堂當中的桌上已經擺滿幾盤大塊的魚和肉，馬上就催着母親和我們坐到上位去。今天釣的魚是讓我們帶進城去了。水生的大哥提着風雨燈在送我們的路上還説：［你們喜歡魚，我明天再給你們釣些送來。］　　我們在每年清明總是要這麽帶些魚進城的。</p>
<p>以後我們還是年年要照例上墳去的。我們的年齡增加，可是荒蕪的由隨處都可以看見。溪水邊剩下的就只是空蕩蕩的垂楊，水生和一些强壯的漢子都説是被［拉夫］去了以後就不見回來，我們的佃户又是另外一個姓王的了。母親説，［這老王很可惡，不要看他以老賣老的樣子，他會弄點鬼過塲的。如果不把租交够，就退他的佃。］我覺得母親也變了。從前每回來上墳，她總是快快樂樂地向我們談些鄉村裏的美妙故事，而現在她也居然連一刻工夫都没有放下打算盤的心思了。一走到老王的門前，母親就嚷着租的問題，［你不繳不行的，我們一年要上五年糧的！］母親鐵着臉這麽説着，老王就撲的跪下去了。老王嘮嘮叨叨，母親也嘮嘮叨叨。這天我們没有飯吃，没有魚釣，我們是空着一雙手尾着母親的抱怨聲進城來了。</p>
<p>以後我就離開了故鄉，雖然那花明柳暗的景片總時常展開在我的眼前。</p>
<p>與其説是想念那幽靜的故鄉，莫如説是都市的無情生活使我太難受，在幾年的干戈擾攘之後，我居然下了一個很大的决心回去了。城裏面已經很蕭條，許多從前很熱閙的酒店飯店都關了門，紅燈烟館雖是添了幾家，可是街上很早就没有甚麽人走，至於母親是躺在自家的烟燈旁邊也顯得更加衰老了。她一提起水災後的租穀，就不斷的嘆氣抱怨。父親的墳山好久都不敢去了。可是爲了希望父親保佑，母親又呌我趁着近來平靜些，趕這清明時節上墳去。</p>
<p>從前常常憬憬着的故鄉景片，這回是眞實地又呈在我的眼前。山依然茂林修竹，水依然兩岸垂楊，可是田多半是一些亂草，人都睜着一雙賊一般的眼睛來看我們了。一聽見樹梢的風聲，就會令人懷疑那陰森處在藏着甚麽陰謀，一兩個檻褸的大漢擠眉弄眼地向我們身邊走過，就會令人懷疑那藏在衣襟下的粗手在摸着明晃晃的鋼刀。母親今天來的時候，本來决定趁這機會去找一下老王的，可是在父親的碑前把頭磕過，母親就催着趕快收拾奠酒，趕太陽還没有落山的時候就進城去。這時候如果站在這墳堆面前向着那陰森森的山林和溪柳一望，眞是好像隨處都可以伸出一隻粗暴的手來似的。我們不禁毛髮悚然了。母親非常失悔的説［不該來，不該來。］我們今天是揑着一把汗進城去了。一進城，我才深深地透出一口氣；［呵，故鄉！］</p>

<h3 id="c237">談［紅毛子］ <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>打開古爾孟（ＲemydeＧourmont）的［假面集］（ＬeＬivreＭasques），翻着看下去，你可以看見一幅一幅的瓦羅桐（Ｖallolon）作的漫畫。其中有一幅也許會特别引起你的注意。那是用一條曲綫勾出來的臉孔，有兩個小圓圈代替着眼睛。那就是［紅毛子］（ＰoildeＣai）otte）的作者居爾·勒那爾（JulesRenardi864i9io）。</p>
<p>雖然現在回想起來，覺得勒那爾並不是怎樣了不起的偉大的作家，可是，在一九二五年前後，在那種圍繞我的象徵主義的　圍氣中，勒那爾，維勒得拉克（Ｖildrac），以至於天主教的詩人克羅代爾（Ｐ、Ｃlaude），同時，也都成了我所歡喜的作家了。勒那爾的那篇［紅毛子］，是特别地令我感到歡喜。</p>
<p>勒那爾是一位法國的地方作家。自然，在他的作品中，没有左拉的［魯貢，馬卡爾］裏的那樣複雜的社會生活的反映。然而，在暴露世紀末的鄉村社會中的不調和之點上，他的作品［紅毛子］，也不能説没有相當的意義。如果掀開［红毛子］那本書，看一看瓦羅桐畫的那些漫畫的話，我們都會多少感到勒那爾的諷駡和酸涙來的。實在説，對於小説［紅毛子］（一八九四），我不曾細讀過，我所細讀過的，是他以後改作的獨幕劇［紅毛子］。那使我當時得到很大的滿足。勒那爾，也可以説是一位自然主義的作家。他在［紅毛子］裏，精確地描寫出了他的幾個人物的性格，和他們的自然的環境。</p>
<p>［紅毛子］是描寫鄉村中的小康的地主家庭的糾葛。一家四口，老爺，太太，大相公，二相公。老爺同太太，是不對的。老爺不同太太講話。除了有時到城裏去打官司之外，老爺就出去作打獵等等鄉紳式的消遣。他是孤獨的。太太呢，也是孤獨的。太太患着歇斯迭里症，時時去找和尚消遣。書本中没有説她同和尚究竟有没有曖昧之點。如説她是去懺悔呢，可是，她回到家裏時，就用盡心機折磨她的小兒子。夫妻之間，像是存在着［難言之隠］似的。太太愛大相公。老爺愛二相公，可是太太看不上。她用盡方法擺弄她的小兒子，而她的兒子則是堅忍主義地，大儒式地，同她倒蛋。雖然他在城中中學作寄宿生，可是暑假是要回家的。他在家中的時節，家中就有戲唱了。暑中午後，就實現了那個一幕的喜劇。這種家庭糾紛的喜劇，我以爲是相當地有意義的。</p>
<p>然而，勒那爾雖指明説：家庭是互不了解的人們的集合，可是他始終未能與以社會學的说明。他的不認識社會，自然是當時法國社會環境所造成。他只能消極地否定着。他找出一條　路：到［自然］中去找安慰。可是，自然究竟能不能够安慰不幸的人呢？</p>
<p>數年前，我在北平時，譯了［紅毛子］的劇本，當時譯名係：［胡蘿蔔毛］，曾披露於華北日報副刋。去年，林取先生又將小説［紅蘿蔔鬚］的很好的譯本，公開於［自由談］上了。雖然並不是什麽了不起的偉大的作品，譯植過來也很有益處的。但我的意思，爲通俗化起見，書名改譯爲［紅毛子］較爲簡明，不知林取先生以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>勒那爾死了二十多年了，現值他的誕生七十年。在這個時節，我希望小説［紅蘿蔔鬚］能出單行本。但是，譯者最好補作一篇有批評性的序文。瓦羅桐的板畫，也最好插了進去。</p>

<p>— 何杰</p>
<p>這第二天倒是更有點可以寫下來的事：我們有要化十幾分　到居庸開的一程，在一個車站上了車，［那個車站的名子可惜又爲我忘記了）買的是三等票，可是三等車裏再也插不進一隻腿去。一個鐵路員工却熱心地爲我們到二等車去看看，結果也是没一有個空座，他就慷慨地説：</p>
<p>［那麽你們幾位就在這頭等二等裏站站罷，好在只有十幾分鐘就到。］</p>
<p>我們也只有聽他的話了，一個個走上來時，火車就也前行。</p>
<p>當我們還没有站定，突然間冒起來一個穿草綠色呢制服的一個第某圑憲兵，他的個子矮小，始終是仰着頭。</p>
<p>［你們是那裏來的？。］</p>
<p>他説的是湖南腔國語，用了像對着兵士喊口號的聲音。還没有等到有人來回答，他就説着第二句話：</p>
<p>［你們站在這裏不行的。］</p>
<p>這次的聲音更大，充滿着尚武精神。</p>
<p>［居庸關就下，没有多少遠。］</p>
<p>我們之中一個這樣説。</p>
<p>［你們不知道麽，這裏有［要人呵！］</p>
<p>他像是大難臨頭似地説，這倒有點奇怪，大家同時把眼向四面望望，想看看［要人］有多麽［要］。</p>
<p>可是那位憲兵［要人］又呌着　　［你們還不知道利害麽？］</p>
<p>説此話時，　　　　，威風　　，好像我們都是他的敌人。那時　我倒想　一　，　　攝影家，將那姿式照了下來，倒也可以啓發民族精神。</p>
<p>有幾個知道利害的，就主張挪動挪動，實在無處可走，只好到兩車相接處的地方站好。過後情景，因爲站在車外，没法子看見，不知那位勇士，是否像　勝歸來，有經過凱旋門的得意。</p>
<p>我們却受點罪，車行山洞中，煤烟氣嗆得不敢呼吸。</p>
<p>此節旣已寫出，最精彩部分就算完成，後面没有再寫下去的必要了。還可以附一筆的是：我們居然一個也不少地又回到了北平。</p>

<p>想着想着，隊伍已經在閙哄哄中排好了，彎彎地排出兩排。不知往什麽地方，冒出了校長的影子，她大槪又是來訓什麽話了。一見到她，我就生氣，她實在是一個什麽都不知的糊塗東西，妖冶打扮才是嘔人呢。她的名字呌毛荷根，聽説是日本一個女高的學生，事變後回省，在［醉仙飯店］跟大賣國賊　洽睡過一宿覺，又因爲會説幾句日本話，過幾天就派她爲女中的校長，要不然這樣的一個品行不端學　不足的人，怎能作女中的校長，省裏人，没有一個不知道女中的校長是個高等野鷄！没有一個不知道她連一封信都寫不通！可是，不管怎樣，她作校長已經快二年了，還是没有人敢搶她的位置。她作校長，每學期只不過到校四五次，其餘的日子都幹什麽呢？到什麽地方去了呢？天知道，這就是［滿洲國］的教育人材！</p>

<h3 id="c241">新生活運動觀 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>新生活運動的號召，震天價地的響了，我們在報上天天讀到各種各樣關於新生活運動的宣言演講和紀事，覺得這裏　的國度里又生出了一種朝氣，雖然没有像暴風雨一般剌激人們的感情，但這種平和的引人走向健美生活之路底道義的感動力，在不願苟且生活的人羣裏面，也是有很大的作用的。</p>
<p>提倡新生活自然就是否定了舊生活；舊生活裏面的内容是什麽呢？也許有在這里先説一説的必要。</p>
<p>第一，在時代的意義上講，舊生活應該是指殘餘的封建樣式的生活，及資本掠奪生活。譬如地主，豪紳，奸商一流人物的生活，都是天天從事掠奪别人的血汗爲生活的，卽所謂寄生生活。次之，在勞働的意義上講：中國有許多遺老遺少以及洋塲公子，都是不勞不働而過着窮奢極慾的生活。於今社會上流行的更有一種敲詐生活，卽憑籍一個勢力向一羣没有勢力的弱者敲詐爲生的生活。</p>
<p>舊生活裏面更有不知生活，無力生活的一大羣人，天天在荒村野店或街頭巷尾，過着沿門討吃的生活。</p>
<p>上面是從經濟的這一面説出舊生活有這麽多無謂的内容。若從精神的那一面着眼，我們又可以指得出更多，更壞的内容。</p>
<p>第一是人心奸險，事事講求用手段：第二是懶惰下流。這種習氣在所謂上流社會層，幾乎是一種普遍的現象，穿、吃、喝是現成的，由祖傳或由自己剥奪而來的金錢裝成的富翁，大老爺或世家子，以及太太小姐之流，這些人整天是没有事的，於是只有抽雅片烟，搓麻將，打撲克，看影戲，上跳舞廳，跑狗塲，回力球塲，賭塲，或到ＸＸ院，以消磨這一生，中流社會層也大都游手好閒，不想做事，對於事情是敷衍塞責的，情願不做事坐在家里苦悶，或去誘惑女人。下流社會層之羣更談不上人底生活，也許不是要懶惰，要下流，祇因爲他們根本没有事做，没有爬到上流或中流裏面去。這些懶惰，下流的習氣，會使中國，現實社會生活更墮落，同樣，也是中國社會環境養成的。</p>
<p>舊生活的内容有如上述那樣頂兒尖兒的腐敗，新生活的提倡當然是天經地義，誰也不應該異調的。但新生活的内容應該怎樣，就當代要人們所提示的，禮義廉恥，清潔樸儉等等而外，我們覺得還要深刻的補充幾點。</p>
<p>那就是新生活運動還要注意到一班人生活的實際，用最大的努力减少人們的飢寒之苦，用嚴厲的制裁，减少人間的剥削行爲，用有效的方法，實行勞働生活，消滅寄生生活。</p>
<p>這新生活運動，要贏得多大的功績，單靠領袖人物的號召，還是不够的，應發動羣衆的力量，注意有組織的活動，并且要長久的持續下去。否則，也是空談。</p>
<h3 id="c242">裁員 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>近來，一層陰翳蒙上了各個人的心，在每個人的臉上，都浮露着一種張皇的彩色。</p>
<p>不，不能這樣説，這色彩的張皇，並不是一律都浮露着的，至少，是有大多數的人，仍在現示着愉快的神容，彷彿還没有理會到有［裁員］的不幸事件底發生，理會的，只不過是那大多數中的低級的一部而已！</p>
<p>許是一種反常的表現吧？當這消息傳出以後，在工作上，似乎反而緊張了，那積存的工作，很迅速的滑了過去，這成效，是素來所少見的。其實呢？空洞塡滿了他們的心，在被巨大的錘子　擊着，併出的，是那濺滿了胸膛的空虚的火花呵！</p>
<p>｜｜怎麽樣，你聽到了什麽消息？　　｜｜不知這消息是眞的不？</p>
<p>是的，人，每逢到了某一個極緊張的驚惶的程度時，總會這樣不自禁的詢問着。雖則在事後，也明知所詢問的對象是同樣的茫然者。</p>
<p>陰翳，更加重了，加重了，蒙蔽得透不過一點兒氣息。然而，自己還要掙扎着，掙扎着，因爲只有在掙扎裏，才含有僥倖的成分的。</p>
<p>在平時，總嫌日子過得太快，一轉眼就是一天，而現在呢？却恨牠跑得太慢了，不死不活地，在拖延着，把憂鬱，煩惱，苦悶：：：更濃重的加在每個人的身上。</p>

<p>｜｜呵？你：：：你，在那兒：：：：？</p>
<p>立時的，圍過來許多的人，眼睛，分外的大了，大了，在冒着火光，臉龐上，堆着濃厚的嚴肅。</p>

<p>｜｜哼，還不相信？老李在ＸＸ室親眼看見的。</p>
<p>挾着懷疑的心情，聚集的人散去了。他們，不能自制的在私忖着：</p>

<h3 id="c243">粗神分析學的血族相婚問題 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 凌冰</p>
<p>昨日本刋載有綠莎君的血統太近不宜結婚的問題，這是中國人素來以爲不成問題的問題。祗要一想社會上對於同血族的青年男女的戀愛取怎樣一種深惡痛絶的態度，可見［不宜］兩字已經如何肯定了。無論怎樣排斥舊禮教的吃人性的新人物，對於舊禮教在這一事相上所樹立的權威，也很少敢加以懷疑過。從知一切問題如果不由正確的歷史的和科學的見地施行檢察，則所謂對於舊禮教的摧陷擴清的工作，不外是些浪漫的氣勢罷了。綠莎君舉出歷史上近親爲婚的事實和日本皇室所盛行的婚制作爲反證，立論極爲得體。此點據美國現代心理學家托萊頓（ＡＴridon）氏之解釋，以爲血族相姦的恐怖在人類心理同倫理兩方都是比較近今才發達的。在古代的埃及同秘魯的王朝實行血族相姦。古代神道於此亦甚放縱，創世紀的諸作者必定認可血族相姦的觀念以作爲亞當夏娃後裔之唯一的解釋的根據。弗拉查（Ｆrazer）説得好：［没有一條法律鼓勵人們去飲食，也没有一條法律禁止人們置　於火。因爲人們式飲式食並不令人熾其手乃是由於本能的緣故。］假若人們天性忌諱血族相姦的話，那末便再不需要立法强制他們去避免了。</p>
<p>托氏認爲血族相姦的起因是由於家庭中兩性兒童自幼相處，於是第一次發生的性的慾望便天然以所接近的異性爲目的。至於一切種族不約而同的採取嚴峻的立法以資取締，那是因爲古代一族之長老常有獨佔羣雌屏斥衆男卒爲青年合力所殺而諸青年各思獨佔排斥其餘於是互相殺戮以起，故相約不犯以示防閑的緣故。</p>
<p>綠莎君以爲學者非難近族爲婚，乃爲防止血族中特殊遺傳的缺陷加倍傳及子孫的影響之故。但托氏對此却有獨特的兒解：他以爲在現代社會制度下結婚負擔之不易，使一般不健全的份子對於結婚的責任發生避難就易的傾向，而血族相愛往往變成這種人的滿足慾望的捷徑。在另一方面孱怯的人不自信有在大社會中情塲爭競的魄力，所以便以血統相近的人（因爲血統相近便有許多接近上的便利）爲結婚的對象，這是近親相結的一般原因。此種人旣然自身賦予畸形，他的後嗣之不强壯乃是意中之事。由此觀之則缺陷應是原因而遺傳才是應有的結果，僣綠莎君所見之遺傳爲因缺陷爲果之説，恰恰因果倒置呢。</p>

<p>— 智藏</p>
<p>｜兩個不相識者｜</p>
<p>南京路Ｓ公司的南貨部裏，有一位青年主顧，正付了一塊錢要把他所買的一塊火腿，讓店員拿去包紥，突然將這塊火腿拿起來翻覆地看了，重又放了下來。［這一塊到底好不好？我是不懂的］，他説了，像是徵求店員的意見。</p>
<p>［這塊火腿倒不差呢：：：，］一個站在這青年身旁的盛裝似少婦模樣的女人，也是在買什麽，顯然和這青年並不相識，忽然，伸過手來將那塊火腿拿過去望了望，自言自語地説着。這一些也不奇怪，大家都是買客。</p>
<p>［謝謝你，］這青年轉過身來，向她很謙和地點了點頭，他的意識像是已越出大家同是買客的範圍</p>
<p>火腿已經包紥好了，由另一個店員送到原櫃臺上。青年不得不悵悵地離了開去。但是，一轉身又到洋雜部，在看看這樣，望望那樣，終於買了一條領帶。</p>
<p>青年回過頭來，已看見那女人腋下已挾了一大包東西，朝這裏走過來。青年本來走得很慢，現在更有一步復一步地兩脚在地上拖着，等那女人走近身。　　［今天倒有空？買了這許多東西］。青年的聲調是平而穏，脚底下的速率早已加緊，與女人的相等，並肩而走。</p>
<p>女人别過頭來看了看他，但没有回話。</p>
<p>［怪重的，我可以替你拿着嗎？］</p>
<p>女人好像笑了一笑，還是没有話。青年再也不等她第二個更顯明的允意的表示，兩手已伸到她腋下把那個紙包换到自己的腋下。兩個人走着，走着，更靠近了些。</p>
<p>［没有什麽再要買吧？我們可以揀個地方談谈嗎？］青年問</p>
<p>［爲什麽不可以呢，可是，出來時原想洗個澡的，］女人開口了。</p>
<p>［那末，你请客，好嗎？］青年嘻皮着臉。</p>
<p>［怎麽不好？］</p>
<p>但是女人没有出大門的意思，却反而踏進了電梯，於是青年不得不跟了進去。這時，青年着實有些躊躇起來了。他想：［眞會有這種事？難道眞個她會請客？决不會的，决不會的！但是，我身上除了所剩下的兩個雙毫外，一無所有，萬一：：：怎麽辦呢？而這塊火腿又是家裏人呌我買回去的，今天非送家去不行。是什麽圈套吧？决不會的，然則，怎樣辦呢：：：别管牠，還是看牠一個究竟，反正我身上只有兩個雙毫］青年終於下了探險家似的决心。</p>
<p>電梯停了，他們出來，走到旅館的一部。隨卽由一個侍者的引導，進了一間幽靜的房間。塡寫了循環簿，女人從手皮夾裏摸出一張十元的鈔票，付給侍者，回頭對青年説：［你需要吃些什麽吧］？回答是不要，侍得卽退了出去，同時，房間裏的空氣頓時跳躍起來。</p>
<p>［你可以告訴我你的姓？］青年問。</p>
<p>［爲什麽這般痴心呢？我不問你的姓，你也不必問我的，那不好嗎？］</p>
<p>［你不是説要洗澡嗎？］</p>
<p>［現在，我有了你，就不需要牠］。</p>
<p>说着送過一個媚笑［不是嗎？］</p>
<p>一個醉的吻，溶合了他們兩顆的心。</p>
<p>他們滿足了慾望，時候已至深夜，兩人走出公司的時候，青年問：</p>
<p>［我們幾時再見呢？］</p>
<p>没有回答。（完）</p>

<p>— 人</p>
<p>五年前，腦海中浮起了何等偉大的空中樓閣，可是，五年後，五年後的今日，除了幻滅以前的空想外，什麽事都不敢再希望了。我已認識先生　　　　什麽［學校是小的社會］的话是騙人的。假使學校眞的是小的社會的話，怎麽當我跨進社會的第一步就會使我戰抖畏縮而對事無從着手呢，［學校不是小的社會，而社會乃是眞眞的學校。］這乃是二年來服務所給我的答覆。</p>
<p>以教師販賣過來的知識，自己以爲是很飽足而盛意地奔進社會裏去謀生了。因此除因自己學識淺陋而不合實用遭人輕視之外，更因無資格而得不到生活的飽足，於是，我又知道在謀生的途上是少不了資格的。呵！現社會給予我們青年的又有另一種的梏桎了。資格！在謀生的途徑上還需要資格去做後盾的！</p>
<p>爲了資格，有一個不能忘懷的可咒詛的回憶掠上我的心頭來。是三年前吧！我，那樣懦弱可憐的我，心裏燃着入大學的慾，但是去入大學，又非有中學的畢業證書不可，因此跨進學校去拿這所謂文憑的東西，而另一方面給求智慾有機會去滿足。戰抖着向學校去報名，竟能得到教務主任的允納説：［轉學證書慢慢的拿來，你先去付費註册上課好了。］一情是這樣的决定了，除了付費外什麽手續都没有，便可以將舖蓋行李搬往校來了。我滿懷的熱情，帶着迅速的步伐上課去，又下課來。</p>
<p>課堂裏閙得不得了，骯得簡直不能相信它是教室。在唱着歌的，嚼着花生米的，結絨繩的，談笑的，渴睡的，什麽怪樣都有。自然囉！先生他會來呌學生做些什麽呢？祗有胡閙，鬼混，才是功課呀！</p>
<p>一本本的書都是厚厚的西裝金字硬板書，裏面都横爬着蟹形的字，還有三角呀！正弦呀！縱坐標，横坐標呀：：：：：：我實在有些害怕，但，很奇妙的同時有一絲絲輕微的熱望在　的心頭抓着　　地　因爲我想，這學期中，我可以得到很多　學　學問的知識了，可是一月來，書依舊是本嶄新的書，後來我一經還不曾認清我們課任先生的尊姓大名。因爲我們師生間接促的機會太少了，學校當局并不曾顧慮到我們學生的需要，譬如説運用思想的功課是應該放在上午的，可是事實上竟把它放在下午。又如每星期應授課六小時的功課竟會分二天來教｜每日接連三小時。這樣在時間上算是補足外，對于學生是否有益，那是一個似乎不很嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>所以在學校裏除了吃，穿，睡，鬼混，費錢。什麽都可不問不聞了。</p>
<p>學校的黑幕一層：暴露了，我的神秘的憧憬也逐漸淡化了。［學校是社會嗎？］我不能否認二年來服務所給我的像鐵一樣的答覆。</p>

<p>四、曼谷</p>
<p>曼谷是暹羅的國都，因爲水陸交通的便利，所以曼谷不僅是暹國的政治中心，而且是全暹的商業樞鈕，當船進湄南河的時候，我們就可以看到許多奇異的建築：有的像木亭，有的像台榭，有的像鴿籠，有的像城堡，一座座不同的木屋，疏疏落落在湄南河邊點綴着，最特别的，那些木屋不是造在陸地，而是浮在河面或用木椿架在水中，每一座木屋的門口，又都繫着一只長不滿五尺，只能容一個人坐的小船，這就是他們代步的器具，縱然是三五歳的小孩，也能划着小船在遼闊的湄南河中蕩漾。</p>

<p>兄妹可以做夫妻</p>
<p>兄妹可以結爲夫婦，除了野蠻民族外，近世文明國家可説少有的事，可是這種怪俗，在暹羅的王族中，却是至今盛行着的，據説當第一世王謀纂鄭昭的時候，他妻｜｜鄭昭之女｜｜也是參與機密的　後來他做了國王，恐　他的女婿，將來也要如法　製於是就不許他的王孫娶外面的老婆，只能和自己的姊妹結婚，同時，公主如果不止一個的話，那末　餘的也不准出嫁，在宫中留養一生，從此，暹國列代的君主，都奉行不諱，一直到現在。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram: Men Bingyue and others, in Linhe, together with Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo, handled the reorganization of Sun's army, which is now largely complete. They returned to Baotou on the afternoon of the 4th and will return to Beiping within days. The disarmament of Sun's army has been completed, and the Jin-Sui army has begun demobilization. All unarmed officers and soldiers of Sun's army are being escorted from the front lines to Baotou in batches for resettlement. The first batch of more than 700 people is expected to arrive in Baotou in two or three days. The 35th Army Headquarters ordered Feng Yuxi's troops to set up tents near the station as a resting place for these officers and soldiers, with supplies handled jointly by the county government and the military station. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Telegram, 4th: The total number of disarmed officers and soldiers of Sun's army is approximately 31,000. They have been continuously passing through Linhe and heading east in close succession. The Jin-Sui army has set up tents and stoves along the way, providing cooked food and rice porridge, treating them extremely well. The wounded are also being treated with medicine by military doctors, and those with more serious injuries are being admitted to hospitals for medical treatment. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Fu, accompanied by Zhao Chengshou, inspected various reception stations. Seeing that the food and water prepared at the Xiwai station were somewhat inadequate, Fu was extremely angry and dismissed Yang, a patrol officer of the Linhe Public Security Bureau, who was responsible for the matter. A public bathhouse was also contracted so that all disarmed officers could bathe before leaving. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe Branch Telegram: Wang Jingguo is currently deploying defenses in the San Shenggong area, with heavy troops stationed along the line from the Yellow River to Lang Mountain. The defeated Sun's army, seeing no opportunity to take advantage, decided to surrender immediately. Order has now been relatively stabilized. Small scattered units have been disarmed separately, and large units have been designated assembly points to temporarily station and await reorganization. Those approaching the sentry line are immediately surrounded and disarmed. Close contact has now been established with the Ningxia army to implement encirclement, hoping for an early resolution.

<p>Gu Liangmin and Wang Jun Each Lead Troops to Intercept and Suppress</p>
<p>(Jinan) Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., Bandit Liu fled to the western gate of Ganyu County, set fires, and plundered. At 8 p.m., they climbed the city walls and entered, burning, killing, raping, and looting terribly. This morning, they fled to Shaguo Town, southwest of the city. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division, has led troops forward from Gan to pursue and suppress them. Wang Jun led troops to Dapuh, disembarked, and intercepted them. Chen Guofu telegraphed Han, requesting that he disregard boundaries and send troops to pursue them. According to a coffin bearer who escaped from the bandits, he carried a corpse, short and yellow-faced, wrapped in yellow cloth and covered with a Russian blanket. Bandit leaders surrounded it, burning paper and weeping along the way. It is generally speculated that it is Liu Guitang. Also, Zhan Shutang has now led troops to return to Jinan after demobilization, and Xu Wenyao led troops to Zhoucun. Yesterday, the provincial army also killed 40-50 bandits of Liu, seizing 40-50 guns and two mortars and machine guns each. Liu Guitang's representative, Ji Shun, was executed by shooting after being personally interrogated by Han. Gong confessed that Liu repeatedly tried to escape, but his subordinates refused, saying that if he ran again, they would kill him, so Liu did not dare to run. (4th Special Telegram)</p>

The talks continued until 5 p.m. without results. At that time, 600-700 Tangshan miners flocked to the front of the Commissioner's Office, surrounding it and shouting various slogans, demanding immediate recognition of the conditions they had proposed. Zhao Dazhong came out of the Commissioner's Office at this time and gave a speech to the workers, saying that the conditions we have proposed must have results, and then he left. Afterwards, he did not show his face. The workers pushed 11 representatives into the office to meet Tao Shangming and presented two sets of demands: A. Regarding the official side: 1. Allow the establishment of a United Workers' Association of the War Zone as an organ for managing labor-management affairs in the Yu County area. 2. Overthrow all old trade unions in the counties within the war zone. 3. Overthrow all party organizations in the war zone. B. Regarding the mining side: A total of ten conditions were proposed. The prerequisites were articles 2 and 8. 2. The labor-management contract of the 20th year of the Republic must be fulfilled immediately. 8. The wages during the strike period must be paid by the mining side immediately. Negotiations lasted for three hours without results. The eleven representatives withdrew and put up another representative to go inside and demand, but to no avail. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The workers who surrounded the Commissioner's Office on the night of the 3rd continued until 1 a.m. this morning. Finally, seven representatives were elected to meet Tao three times and expressed their understanding to Tao. Regarding the three official conditions, Tao said that the first one could not be answered immediately and must be reported to his superiors. The scope of the second and third articles was very broad, and he had no authority to accept responsibility on behalf of others. The worker representatives said that the second and third articles could be waived, but the first article must be promised immediately and a notice issued. The mining conditions must also be negotiated on his behalf and recognized immediately, otherwise the workers would never leave. From 5 p.m., Tao discussed the matter several times with Gu Zhen, the manager of the Tianjin Mining Bureau, by telephone. Gu replied to the second article that the mining side had not violated the contract in treating the workers, and there was no need to fulfill the contract of the 20th year of the Republic. He replied to the eighth article that the mining side would never recognize the payment of wages to striking workers in order to encourage workers to strike. Seeing no results, the workers continued to surround until 2 a.m. this morning. Every few minutes, they shouted slogans once. Most of the workers, suffering from hunger, climbed to the ends of the telegraph poles and shouted slogans miserably, hoping for people's sympathy. Zhao Xun, Tao Shangming, and the inspectors stationed in the factory by the Industrial Office were all surrounded in the Commissioner's Office and could not get out. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The workers of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company, because the company handled the matter properly, were persuaded to resume work shortly after the workers' strike began on the afternoon of the 3rd. The Huaxin Yarn Factory, after manager Zhou Shutao's persuasion, also resumed work on the 3rd. Currently, the only problem in the Tangshan labor unrest is still the Kailuan Mine. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tangshan miners surrounded the Yu County Administrative Commissioner's Office until 4 a.m. on the 4th before dispersing. Around 3 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, the workers were exhausted but still unwilling to leave immediately. Li Yinchun, the inspector stationed in the factory by the Industrial Office, contacted Zhao Dazhong by telephone and decided: (1) Zhao Dazhong is responsible for first leading the workers back and removing the siege. (2) Li Yinchun is responsible for communicating the conditions proposed by the workers to the mining side and will invite official representatives from the mining side to negotiate the conditions with the labor side at noon on the 5th. However, when Zhao Dazhong led the workers back, he stated that if the mining bureau representatives did not arrive at noon on the 5th, he would not be responsible for any actions taken by the workers. At noon on the 4th, the Tangshan striking workers gathered at the Guangdong Street Trade Union, where Zhao Dazhong gave a speech, advocating that they would never resume work unless they achieved the mining side's recognition of all conditions. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 4th, the workers of the Qixin Cement Company and the Huaxin Yarn Factory still had an unstable situation. The workers of Qixin believed that the company had not fully fulfilled the conditions they had proposed. The workers of Huaxin also believed that the factory did not agree to issue wartime meal expenses at the same treatment as staff and only agreed to pay half of the wages during the strike period, causing dissatisfaction. Zhao Dazhong is currently vigorously agitating for the recurrence of the labor unrest in these two factories, so the turmoil will continue to expand. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e9">British Invasion of Lancang Not Yet Confirmed by Official Telegrams <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>British Consulate in Beijing Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the news that British people invaded and occupied Lancang County, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Yunnan Provincial Government on the 4th to inquire. The British Consulate in Beijing stated that the rumor may be a telegraphic error. The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Office in Beijing said that there is no official telegram confirming the British occupation of Lancang. The truth will be clear after the telegram from the provincial government arrives. However, according to recent reliable news, the British have indeed occupied Zhenkang County. The area is rich in gold, even more valuable than the silver mines of Panhong. The British are gaining an inch after inch, and their ambitions are unlimited. It is said that the British method of invasion is to buy over unscrupulous natives and natives of Burma to act as vanguards, while their formal army urges them on from behind. The southwest border defense is in imminent danger. The fundamental solution depends on delineating the border clearly to avoid foreigners using excuses. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of the Executive Yuan said that the Yunnan Provincial authorities have not yet sent a telegram to report the British invasion of Lancang. In order to consolidate the southwest border defense, the Yuan has urgently telegraphed Yunnan Chairman Long Yun to immediately send personnel to investigate and report, and ordered the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, and the General Staff to immediately select commissioners to go to Yunnan to survey and delineate the border to avoid foreigners using excuses to invade. In an interview, the British Consul in Beijing said that the consulate had not received a telegram regarding the Japanese telegram that British troops had occupied Lancang. The telegram may have been sent with a purpose. His country's government and people only seek trade with China and have no ambition to invade land. There are often small conflicts between natives of your country and natives of Burma and India in the border area between Yunnan and Burma, all of which are private disputes and do not affect the overall situation. According to my speculation, there may be small conflicts between the two sides' natives in the border area between Yunnan and Burma, but they are definitely not as serious as the rumors.

<p>Various Salt Commissioners Report on Work Situation</p>
<p>Conference Scheduled for Three to Five Days</p>
<p>Salt Merchant Representatives Petition to Maintain Sail Transport</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Salt Affairs Administration convened the National Salt Affairs Conference, which opened on the morning of the 4th. Chairman Zhu Tingqi reported on the current state of salt affairs and the purpose of the conference. The various salt commissioners then reported on the work situation and opened the first meeting. An examination meeting was held in the afternoon. It was decided that the second meeting would continue on the 5th. The conference is scheduled for three to five days. The proposed resolutions are: (1) How to reduce or eliminate illegal surcharges on salt. (2) Unifying the method for genuine salt tax. (3) Unifying transport and sales price methods. (4) How to prevent salt smuggling. (5) Plans for the construction of salt fields and the prosperity of salt affairs. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a representative of a certain salt merchant, the salt tax on the four banks of the Huai River used to be three yuan for the field tax and ten yuan for the bank tax. Last year, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to all salt fields across the country to levy the same tax amount, regardless of whether there were unexpected natural disasters on the bank or field, or whether the salt transport had safely reached the bank. Both fixed taxes must be paid, which salt merchants believe is unreasonable. Furthermore, the weight of salt packages used to be sixteen taels and eight qian per catty due to the use of old scales. Since the implementation of the new metric system, each catty is only fourteen taels. Since salt packages must be taxed according to their weight, the salt tax has effectively increased. This matter has been under negotiation with the salt authorities by salt merchants on the four banks of the Huai River for years, but no resolution has been reached. Recently, the Salt Affairs Administration convened a reorganization meeting in Beijing due to the increasingly serious disputes to find a concrete solution. The conference is scheduled for three days, and the results of the discussion are still under study. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Northwest After the Ningxia War <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Ningxia military dispute has been resolved through the central government's appropriate handling. Sun Dianying has left the front lines, and the disbandment and reorganization of his troops is urgently needed. Sun's troops are a complex mixture of elements with lax discipline. If they are not properly managed, it will become a persistent problem. We must not allow them to run rampant for the sake of the livelihoods of the people of Ningxia and northern Shaanxi, lest they become a future hidden danger.</p>
<p>Not only that, but now that the chaos has ended, local order has not yet been restored. The people, survivors of the disaster, are unable to do anything. It is the government's responsibility to lend a hand. There are many short-term solutions, the most important of which are: First, appease the refugees. The area along the Yellow River Houtao, up to the boundary of Shaanxi, was originally a relatively prosperous area awaiting development. It would not be difficult to make it prosperous in a short period of time. However, since 1926, the Houtao, known as "the only rich area among the hundred ills of the Yellow River," has become desolate. The former fields have mostly become wasteland. The reason for this is that most of the people who have cultivated in the Houtao over the years are landowners from Shanxi and Hebei provinces who come to cultivate in the spring and return after the autumn harvest. Very few settle there permanently. In recent years, due to repeated wars and banditry, farmers themselves lack the ability to defend themselves and are even more reluctant to move forward. Even the seeds for the Houtao granary are lacking. When Sun's army was stationed in Wuyuan, the number of troops was greater than the local population. The burden of supply was exhausting. In addition, the wartime requisitions of the past few months have been truly unbearable. Now that the war has just ended and the overall situation has been initially stabilized, it is necessary to strictly guard against bandits. Then the farmers from Shanxi and Hebei provinces will be willing to continue cultivating, and the local people will not be displaced. Second, eliminate corruption and strive for political integrity. If the local officials in charge can reduce penalties and taxes and be honest and self-disciplined, the people will be pleased and live and work in peace. Third, facilitate transportation and freight. Although the Houtao and Ningxia are located in remote border areas, their economic relations have gradually moved away from the primitive state and entered the period of commodity exchange. The export of leather and grain to other places is still considerable. However, since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been blocked. Not only has local commerce and transportation been frequently blocked, but Tianjin and Beijing have also been indirectly affected. Therefore, facilitating transportation is also urgently needed.</p>
<p>The above three points are only temporary emergency measures. Given the vastness of the Northwest and the importance of national defense, these three points alone are not enough to be considered completely satisfactory. Fortunately, the development of the Northwest has become a unanimous call from the Chinese people. From Gansu, Ningxia, the Yellow River Houtao to Xinjiang and Qinghai, all are considered to be in urgent need of development. However, Qinghai and Xinjiang are far away. With China's current economic and human resources, it is only possible to provide guidance in the political aspect first and not to directly carry out development work. Only the Houtao is different. Today, it is possible to reach Baotou directly from the PingSui Railway. Tunnelling and reclamation are not difficult to achieve. However, the rural economy is slow to circulate. This is true in the south, and even more so in the northern border areas. Without huge financial resources as backing, it is difficult to succeed. Such reclamation should be funded by the state first. After considerable achievements have been made, private investment will surely follow. The Economic Committee decided to allocate 2.5 million yuan for the development of the Northwest. Although it is a drop in the bucket and difficult to achieve significant results, it is better than nothing. In the future, the development of the Northwest should be jointly undertaken by the government and the people. The government should be the pioneer, and we should be the backers. Without this plan, mere empty talk is meaningless.</p>

<p>(Moscow) According to Pravda's view, the Japanese government's approval of the Japanese-Manchurian economic policy is of great significance. First, we know that the Japanese military and the Colonial Affairs Ministry have been fighting fiercely over the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway. This reorganization will militarize the South Manchuria Railway, and the current facts show the victory of the military. At the same time, this new plan is to eliminate conflicts between the military and related zaibatsu, and formally allows private capital to have "freedom of action." Pravda pointed out that the above plan is essentially to militarize the entire national economy of Japan's new colony, and to prepare an economic base for Manchuria's military training ground.

<p>"I have three purposes in coming to Japan.

Second, Japan, as a major industrial nation, is now soaring on the world stage. I only wish to gain some observations on the current situation from my impressions. It is rumored that my purpose is to investigate, but it is difficult to achieve results in a mere three weeks. Third, the whole world has encountered a great economic crisis in the past four years, with about 30 million unemployed. There must be various reasons for this economic panic. Based on general economic conditions, or the special circumstances of various countries, it goes without saying.

<p>(Paris) On the 27th of last month, French Ambassador to the UK Corbin verbally explained to British Foreign Secretary Simon the interpretation of "security guarantees" in the implementation of the disarmament convention mentioned in the French reply of March 17th. Subsequently, the French government received another official document from the UK, also raising several questions about the "security guarantees" mentioned in the French reply of March 17th and requesting clarification from France. Foreign Minister Barthou is currently overseeing the drafting of a document by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to respond to the British government. As the issues involved in the British document are of great importance, the drafting of the reply must be extremely careful. After the reply is drafted, it will be submitted for discussion at the next cabinet meeting. (3rd, Havas)</p>

<p>Endorses the Conclusion of a Guarantee Convention</p>
<p>Believes That Military Reduction Is Currently Impossible</p>
<p>Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler recently delivered a speech on disarmament issues, stating that the complete abolition of military aviation cannot be achieved at present, and that the reduction of naval armaments is also not a current matter. Not only reduction, but even prohibition is not feasible. Sandler expressed doubts about the prohibition of arms manufacturing and sales, but believed that the military budget restriction measures proposed by France and Switzerland might be feasible. He also considered the idea of ​​European countries concluding a general guarantee convention as feasible. Sandler also said that the number of countries recognizing the principle of permanent arms control is gradually increasing, which is gratifying. Sandler also advocated that an agreement must be publicly concluded by all countries to stipulate the quantity of German armaments. This agreement must be freely recognized by Germany, and after recognition, it must be jointly monitored by all signatory countries. Sandler finally said that there is a clear trend of arms competition among countries, and no one can remain indifferent to this danger. (3rd, Havas)</p>

<p>Disarmament Attitude is by No Means Stubborn and Unchanging</p>
<p>Removes Anglo-French Doubts about the Rome Agreement</p>
<p>Rome Italian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Suvich, is scheduled to travel to London on April 21st. British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and Lord Privy Seal Eden have all visited Rome one after another, so Suvich's trip is a return visit. It has not yet been decided whether Suvich will stop in Paris at that time. When the time comes, the British and Italian authorities will take advantage of Suvich's trip to conduct a broad consideration of various international issues. Regarding disarmament, Italy still adheres to the opinions in the memorandum of January 31st. (Note: The memorandum issued by Italy on January 30th recognized Germany's rearmament in euphemistic terms. Regarding the disarmament convention, it believed that it should include four points: (1) the abolition of chemical warfare, (2) the prohibition of bombing civilians, (3) limiting the armaments of countries not bound by treaties according to the current level, and (4) limiting the armaments of countries not bound by treaties according to the current level.) However, Italy's attitude is by no means stubborn and unchanging. In other words, even if this trip results in a compromise, if there is another solution that is more easily recognized by the countries concerned, Italy does not intend to oppose it. For example, Italy would not have serious difficulties in concluding an agreement between the two countries to guarantee the implementation of the disarmament convention, because Italy firmly believes that any disarmament convention that can be concluded will greatly ease people's minds. Regarding the issue of Central Europe, especially the recent Italo-Austrian-Hungarian agreement signed in Rome, Suvich will explain to the British government that Italy's purpose is not to organize an Italian power bloc to oppose the French power bloc. If Britain wants to profit in the middle of the two blocs, it will inevitably gain nothing. Furthermore, by the time Suvich departs for England, the Central European issue will have progressed further, as economic experts from Italy, Austria, and Hungary are scheduled to hold a meeting in Rome on April 5th based on the three-nation agreement, which will surely make great progress. As for the rumors in a certain foreign capital that Germany has requested to participate in the meeting of economic experts from Italy, Austria, and Hungary, there is no confirmed news here. The general view is that the three-nation agreement can only be regarded as the beginning of a broad cooperation plan. Other countries, such as France, can also participate in a beneficial way. Only by taking this view will the three-nation agreement have value. (4th, Havas)</p>

<p>The Dutch Social Democratic Labor Party, the second largest political party in the Netherlands, has now decided to abandon its opposition to Dutch armaments and instead advocate reducing armaments along international lines, and has decided to join the cabinet when necessary. The change in the party's policy was prompted by events in Austria and Germany.

<h3 id="e72">World Trade Stagnation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A Few Countries Pursuing Self-Interest Causing the Current Situation</p>
<p>The United States Suffers Greater Losses Than Other Countries</p>
<p>Report by the League of Nations Economic Investigation Group</p>
<p>(Geneva) After a detailed examination of world market trade from 1929 to 1933, the League of Nations Economic Investigation Group learned that the stagnation of world trade is like a [beast] occupying it, and now the spine of this beast must be broken, but it has not yet reached its death. According to the group's investigation, the trade situation in 1933 did show signs of gradual recovery, but its progress was inevitably somewhat slow. Furthermore, upon examination of the trade movements of all parties in 1933, although competition was fierce, price changes were still unpredictable. A few countries have tried their best to seek the revival of their own business, but they are only seeking it for themselves, which does not help the stagnation of the world. The reason for this is that the failure to restore international market credit and the failure to achieve stable exchange rates are all the sources of the disease. The inability to move gold reserves and the excessively strict exchange restrictions are sufficient to hinder price balance. According to most observers, the investigation group's report is not enough to save the stagnant phenomenon of world trade. It is faintly heard that the United States may initiate the reopening of the [failed London Economic Conference]. The investigation group once said that the trade of goods exchanged between countries in the world has fallen by more than 30% compared with previous years. If calculated using gold as a standard, the total value of goods exchanged between countries in 1933 was only more than 50% of that in 1929. If the quantity and value of goods are mixed for calculation, it is only half of that in 1929. As world trade has suffered such a terrible decline, international debts cannot be paid as scheduled. According to a statistician in the League of Nations who used gold as the standard to count the losses suffered by the United States in trade in 1933, it was actually greater than that of other countries. Therefore, although it is gratifying that world trade is slightly recovering, in fact, if no urgent rescue measures are taken to reverse the dangerous situation of this stagnation, the future is still difficult to be optimistic.

<p>(London) The British government's recent debt repayment method is widely regarded as another clear proof of the stability of the British financial position. The Financial News stated that the amount of debt currently borrowed by the British government is exactly the same as the original exchange equalization amount, which shows the British government's intention to place the equalization fund on a permanent basis. It is expected that the interest rate on treasury bills will be reduced. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The British government announced today that it will raise £150 million in 3% interest bonds, to be repaid between 25 and 35 years, issued at a price of 98. The proceeds of the bonds are intended to repay the £10.05 million in 4% interest treasury bills due on April 15th. This move will save the Ministry of Finance £1 million per year.

Public debt at the end of March this year was 26,157,509,000 yuan, compared to 21,362,464,000 yuan last year. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that he is currently studying government revenue from alcohol taxes. Alcohol tax revenue is currently lower than expected. The Treasury Department is considering whether reducing the tax rate on alcohol can increase revenue, but will submit its recommendations to Congress later. The budget shortage may hinder various government plans, and there may be an important announcement about trial measures tomorrow. Market participants expect the US Treasury Department to issue long-term bonds to exchange for the 4th Liberty Bonds due on April 15th. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>The Soviet Union Influences All of Europe, Austria-Hungary Struggles Vigorously</p>
<p>The Conflict Between France and Germany is Intense, and Ill Feelings Between France and Italy are Rising</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Commercial Treaty, the general diplomatic situation in Europe has taken a sharp turn. The diplomatic fronts of the past show a tendency to be reorganized. Originally, the European problem, for many years, has still been centered on France and Germany. Every rise and fall, every victory and defeat, has been based on these two countries. This remains the case after the World War. In France's view, it is best to be able to restrain Germany, and the longer the restraint, the better. The weapons she uses—the weapons to restrain Germany—are two: one is the Treaty of Versailles, and the other is the League of Nations. The Treaty of Versailles is an agreement that restricts Germany's upward development. This agreement is not only recognized by the Allied countries, but Germany itself has also signed it. The League of Nations originally included all the capitalist countries in the world (except the United States). Germany also joined it, but he withdrew at the end of last year. In fact, the Treaty of Versailles, especially the provisions for reparations, prompted Germany to borrow heavily from the United States and promoted Germany's recovery, leading to France's strong enemy today. The smaller European countries were originally intended by France to be satellites to jointly deal with Germany. Unexpectedly, on January 26th of this year, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact was concluded, and France's containment strategy in the east has been greatly reduced. Recently, Austria-Hungary has also become particularly close to Italy. While there may not be any great political magic, it is indeed a very new movement in the economy. In addition to strictly preventing Germany, France must also prepare to deal with Italy.</p>
<p>Of course, France wants to firmly hold onto Britain. However, Britain's traditional foreign policy is to support the two major powers in Europe and is unwilling to over-assist France and suppress Germany. Therefore, France has to change its old strategy, no longer deepening its ill feelings towards the Soviet Union, and taking the opportunity to approach the Soviet Union. The general reason given on the surface for France's anti-Soviet stance is due to ideological relations and the Soviet Union's advocacy of world revolution. In fact, the Soviet Union's previous assessment of the place where the revolution would break out in Europe was not in France. So why did France feel so opposed to the Soviet Union? Because since the [Brest-Litovsk] German-Russian Treaty was concluded, Germany and the Soviet Union have been very close. At the same time, Germany often used diplomacy with the Soviet Union to maneuver between the Allied countries when the Social Democratic Party was in power. The trade relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were also very close. According to military intelligence, Germany even manufactured some important weapons in Russia. While this may not be true, it is enough to provoke France's psychology of suppressing Germany and thus hating Russia. Thus, a state of opposition always existed between France and Russia. Furthermore, after the October Revolution in Russia, it completely denied and refused to repay the 6.44 billion gold francs of debt owed to France before the war. Also, French private investments in the Baku oil fields and other important industries were all confiscated. The Soviet Union believed that this was a matter of course and the fairest move. France, on the other hand, believed that it was an infringement of the sacred and inviolable right of ownership. The two sides have been confronting each other for more than a decade, and it is still unresolved.</p>
<p>Recently, France and the Soviet Union have swept away their former barriers and turned to a tendency of friendship, without mentioning the resolution of past economic outstanding issues as a condition. According to the current situation in France, even if those debts are not repaid at all, it will not cause much damage to France. However, if its most feared enemy rises up, France's losses will naturally be greater. Moreover, Italy has implicitly formed its own system, which is also against the Versailles system, and is almost in a state of semi-withdrawal from the League of Nations. Therefore, France cannot but find other countries in Europe. It so happened that the Soviet Union relaxed its attempt at world revolution, and its relations with Germany deteriorated again. This is why it tried its best to win over the Soviet Union. Needless to say, this is to weaken Germany's influence, and vice versa, to increase France's diplomatic assistance. There is also the claim that the League of Nations will invite the Soviet Union to join, and the Soviet Union has not refused. If this really comes true, international disputes will present a new situation. (March 2, 1934, in Paris)</p>

<p>Economic and Political Advancement, All Countries Feel Its Threat</p>
<p>Using Money for Malicious Propaganda Unfavorable to Our Country</p>
<p>Paris Correspondence, September 18th is not only a date in Chinese history, but also a date in world history. Since that time, China has temporarily lost the four northeastern provinces, and even the area sixty miles outside Beiping has become enemy territory. A portion of Shanghai's prosperity has been reduced to ashes. Good medicine tastes bitter, and for China, it must be said to be a great lesson for revival. However, the significance of September 18th is not limited to the Far East. One point that must be noted first is that, on the whole, Europeans are still somewhat isolated from the situation in the Far East. When the news of the bombing of the Beida Camp reached Europe, the general European public, as the President of the University of Paris told reporters, felt as if they had been struck by a bolt from the blue. Later, a series of bad news further deepened the astonishment of the people of various countries. However, the four northeastern provinces are too far away from here. Not to mention other countries, even the United States and Russia, which have the closest relationship with China, are still trapped in their own situations and unable to act. Therefore, although there were resolutions in Geneva and warnings from a few strong powers, in fact, they just said what they said and did what they did. Those who sympathize sympathize, and those who suffer continue to suffer. The world economic crisis paralyzed the great powers. China relied on others without any resistance. Both of these things were seen clearly by the Japanese. Thus, the four northeastern provinces became the situation they are today. This situation, apart from a few news reporters, diplomats, travelers, businessmen, and politicians with a truly far-sighted vision, is not clearly understood by the general European public based solely on newspaper reports. In other words, in the minds of the general European public, if the significance of September 18th is limited to China's loss of four provinces, then the significance of September 18th is not deep enough. Because most of them are really isolated from the Sino-Japanese incident. Moreover, over the years (especially after September 18th), Japan's foreign propaganda has tarnished China to the point of not being a country, so that many Europeans, even if they do not believe it, can at least silently acquiesce to Japan's behavior.</p>
<p>However, after September 18th, there were many other things that Europeans could not but pay attention to. Because these things happened after September 18th, because they happened in Europe closer to home, and because they happened in Europe itself, Europeans gradually felt their immediate interests. Even gradually felt what the September 18th tragedy had at the time, but was ignored because they were too far away, is [Japan's Ambition]. The best evidence of such feelings among Europeans is Mussolini's article [Eastern Dark Clouds], published in January this year.</p>
<p>The activities of the Japanese, who expressed this ambition, in Europe can be viewed from two aspects: economic and political. Let's first talk about the economic aspect. Anyone who has been in Europe for a long time can see the abundance of Japanese goods on the market in the past two or three years. Not to mention many Japanese goods that impersonate Chinese art and Chinese porcelain. This kind of Japanese goods has been around for a long time, although more and more people are seeing through them. However, because the price is really too cheap, it is different from the price of genuine Chinese art and Chinese porcelain displayed in antique shops in Paris and London. Therefore, there are always people who buy them. In addition, there are some items, such as camphor, that Europe does not produce. Because China is unable to compete with Japan, and even has to buy Japanese goods itself, Japan has always monopolized these items on the European market, and it is not just starting today. However, the Japanese goods that have increased in the European market in the past two or three years are not like this. If you are not careful in a shoe store in Paris, you will buy rubber-soled Japanese-made sports shoes. Many Japanese watches can also be found in watch stores, and beautifully decorated and surprisingly cheap Japanese biscuits can be found in food stores. These food products are not lacking in Britain and France, but because the products made in Britain and France are too good, the prices are too expensive. Since the world economic panic, the purchasing power of the general British and French people is really not enough. On the contrary, the original price of Japanese goods is already low, and coupled with the sudden drop in the external value of the Japanese yen, a large number of goods are dumped into Europe. Even with tariffs, the selling price can still be much cheaper than the prices of domestic goods in various countries. This is why this result occurs. The above are just a few examples to prove that Japanese goods are gradually invading the major markets in Europe. The situation in Paris and London is like this, not to mention other Central European countries.</p>
<p>Japan's economic development in various parts of Europe, just from the few obvious examples mentioned above, is already worth paying attention to. However, there is something more surprising to Europeans, which is the Japanese activity near the Middle Eastern route, which Europeans regard as colonies or spheres of influence.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the Ta Kung Pao published an article listing the economic conflicts between Japan and Britain in Australia. The increasingly dangerous economic competition between Japan and Britain in India is also a fact known to the world. In Britain's attitude towards Japan, these facts have their serious significance, echoing the completion of the British naval base in Singapore. However, there are some other facts that the world does not know much about, and because of the geographical distance closer to Europe, and because of the historical relationship Europeans have a special psychology towards this, they make European politicians, industrialists, businessmen, and even the general public feel flustered, and especially arouse their fears of the [Yellow Peril]. These facts occur on the coast of the Red Sea, especially in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>This kingdom, located in eastern Africa and south of Egypt, has an area of 1.2 million square kilometers and a population of more than 11 million. The European powers, because its industries are not yet developed and its land is still waiting to be developed, have always regarded it as a competition arena for political and economic interests. Two and a half years ago, when Ethiopian King Haile Selassie I was crowned, all countries sent envoys to congratulate him, including Japan. Afterwards, the Ethiopian King sent a delegation to Japan to return the courtesy. Then, the then head envoy, the current Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs, started the first step of industrial and commercial cooperation negotiations between the two countries with the Japanese government. The purpose was to encourage Japanese industrialists and businessmen to develop land in various places in Ethiopia and promote the new development of agriculture and industry in a certain area of the country. Was this negotiation desired by Japan, or requested by Ethiopia? We can ignore it. In short, as a result of the negotiations, the former Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs signed a new tariff agreement in Tokyo with the Japanese government last year, which was favorable to Japanese commerce. At the same time, it was decided to immediately send a technical team composed of agricultural experts, businessmen, and export trade experts to Ethiopia for on-the-spot investigation. Soon, the Ethiopian government issued a declaration, willing to exempt taxes and give about 60 hectares of good land to Japanese immigrants, as a full test for them to plant cotton. In addition, there are other special privileges granted for new industrial establishment tests of the same nature. When these tests are successful, further cooperation with Japanese technology will be needed. Last year, this test period has come to an end. The operation of the Japanese is becoming more and more convenient. In order to encourage land development, to resist the import of European manufactured products and to promote the cultivation of cotton and other plants, the Ethiopian government decided to continue to accommodate the requests of Japanese businessmen on a large scale and allow their immigration. In addition, the Ethiopian King intends to choose a Japanese woman as the Queen, and the Japanese side has candidates such as Viscount Kuroda's daughter. Therefore, up to now, Japan's economic activities in Ethiopia cannot but be said to be a great success.</p>
<p>But before the Japanese forces invaded, the market of Ethiopia was originally in the hands of the Americans. Later, the British used Indian cotton yarn to gradually replace the Americans. Therefore, Ethiopia has become a market for the sales of British colonial products. Recently, the import value of this British colonial cotton yarn still accounts for about 50% of the Ethiopian customs statistics. In the future, after Japanese-operated yarn mills and so on are established in Ethiopia, these British colonial products and the goods of other European powers will be completely cut off from sales in Ethiopia.

<p>| After Yao Huating Led Reinforcements to Repel |</p>
<p>Ma Heying, the remnant of the Hui bandit Ma Zhongying from Xinjiang, wanted to attack Tacheng from Altay with great force. Governor Sheng, seeing that no one was in command of the garrison in Tacheng, appointed General Yao Huating as the Brigadier General Commander of Tacheng's city defense in order to plan the blocking attack. Unfortunately, the announcement</p>

<p>was too late. On the 5th of last month, the bandits had already occupied Emin County and cut off the route for reinforcements from the provincial capital. At that time, Yao was on his way. Upon hearing that Emin had fallen, he bypassed the mountain road alone and advanced at great risk. He arrived in Tacheng at 2:00 AM on the 7th. At that time, Tacheng was not in communication with the provincial capital. He immediately summoned the military and civilians to work together to defend the city and await reinforcements. The morale was boosted. On the morning of the 8th, more than 3,000 bandits attacked Tacheng. They attacked the city day and night for more than ten times. The garrison barely held on, but all attempts failed. On the night of the 10th, the bandits set fire to the surroundings of each city gate and climbed the city walls with ladders. The momentum was great. Yao personally supervised the military and civilians, fought several times, and killed more than 300 bandits under the city. On the 11th, our reinforcements arrived by car. On the 12th, Yao led all the troops to attack together. After a day of street fighting, the bandits finally could not hold on and retreated to Emin. On the 14th, Yao's army attacked Emin again, and the bandits fled southeast. This fierce battle with the bandits was unprecedented in Xinjiang. The aftermath is now being handled. The tens of thousands of people in Tacheng are greatly indebted to General Yao's efforts to protect them and have telegraphed the chairman and governor of the provincial capital to retain him permanently in Tacheng.

<p>Tang Guozhen, Cheng Ruhai, and Others Accompany Him</p>
<p>He Zhuguo First Goes to Songbu to Greet Him</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, planned to personally inspect the recovered bandit areas after returning from Jiangxi. Later, because the generals from various places came to Hankou to meet with him one after another, he has been unable to travel. Now, He Zhuguo, Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Yizhe, Pang Bingxun, Zhang Fang, Liu Zhenhua, Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Hao Mengling, and other senior generals have met in Hankou one after another. They have all agreed on methods for bandit suppression, aftermath, and defense deployment. Zhang then set off from Hankou for eastern Hubei on the morning of the 3rd at 8:00 AM, leading Tang Guozhen, the Chief of the Deputy Officer's Office of the Former Pacification Army Branch, and several staff officers and adjutants, in three cars. Cheng Ruhai, the Administrative Inspector of the Fourth District, accompanied him. It is expected that they will inspect along the area of Huangpi, Qiting, Songbu, Zhongguan Station, Macheng, Huangtugang, and Futian River, and review the stationed troops, comfort the people, and return to Hankou after the official business is completed. In the future, they will go to Xinyang and other places to continue the inspection. He Zhuguo, Commander of the 57th Army, had previously learned of Zhang's tour and led Chief of Staff Yu Jianzhang, Chief of Staff He Jinghua, and others to Songbu to greet him. The remaining generals in Hankou, except for Zhang Fang, the Commander of the 20th Route Army, who went to Jiangxi on the 2nd with He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, and arrived in Nanchang on the 3rd, Liu Zhenhua, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, also returned to Anqing by Anfeng warship on the evening of the 2nd and transferred to Liu'an.

<p>Shandong Province's Troops Mostly Returned to Defense</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Liu Guitang's bandit troops, after being severely attacked by the army near Dadian this morning (2nd), the remnants fled to Cenmeishan Motianling and arrived at Pingshang Town (fifty miles south of Juxian City). This place is the intersection of Juxian, Rizhao, and Ganyu in Jiangsu. In addition to the 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin leading Lin Binghai's regiment, Ma Guanyi's brigade arrived at Dadian by car last night and Zhang Shulin's brigade and Wu Yuanxing's regiment and the cavalry regiment Li Xuande's troops of the 20th Division also arrived and pursued in different directions. Xu Wenyao, the deputy commander of the 29th Division, also intercepted from Banquan to the east. Judging from the current situation, the bandits may flee into Jiangsu, but Wang Junyi's regiment of the 7th Division in Donghai, Jiangsu Province, has already blocked them. Pingshang is only forty or fifty miles away from Rizhao, and it is also very close to Antongwei Seaport and Tao. In the past, this place was ravaged by Liu bandits. It is also unknown whether they will flee back in the future. However, Chairman Han had already sent Li Zhanbiao's troops of the 66th Brigade of the 22nd Division to intercept in Rizhao, and it is hoped that they can be completely wiped out. The provincial army has been fiercely suppressing the bandits in Luomizhuang, forty-mile wharf, Dadian, and other places in Juxian for several days. In addition to obtaining a large number of guns, they also seized many donkeys and horses, which were returned to the people. The captured hostages were also handed over to the local district chief for return. Chairman Han, seeing that there are not many remnants and their annihilation is imminent, does not need a large number of troops and has ordered the remaining troops to return to their original defenses, except for the pursuing troops.

<h3 id="e94">Setting Up a Machine-Made Porcelain Factory in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A Full Capital of One Million</p>
<p>Shao De's Proposed Plan Content</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The large-scale porcelain company of Jiangxi Province, since Xiong Shi and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi agreed to establish it, all parties have been actively proceeding. The Department of Finance has now located a large open space near St. John's School in Xunyang to be used as the factory site. The capital amount is one million yuan, half of which will be allocated by the Ministry of Industry, and the remaining five hundred thousand yuan is said to be raised from commercial shares. The internal organization of the company is divided into three major departments: teaching, testing, and manufacturing. In order to facilitate work and save expenses, it is decided to merge the Provincial Pottery School and the Pottery Testing Institute into the teaching department. According to this organizational plan, the original name is [Machine-Made Pottery Factory]. The plan was proposed by Shao Dehui, the current director of the Jiangxi Pottery Testing Institute, and the content is as follows: Jiangxi Jingdezhen is a porcelain-producing area, and manufacturing relies entirely on manual labor, resulting in excessive costs, unable to compete with the low cost of foreign porcelain manufactured by machines. Therefore, foreign porcelain has been invading the market for a long time, and it is feared that it will be completely occupied. Only by establishing a large-scale factory and using machine manufacturing can we compete with it. Moreover, Jingdezhen is the largest porcelain-producing area in China. The transportation there is not convenient, and the bad habits of the workers are also very deep. To develop, it is necessary to move the location. The counties of Xingzi and Yujiang in Jiangxi produce the most porcelain clay, all downstream of Jingdezhen. If the porcelain factory is established in Jiujiang, the transportation of raw materials and the sales of products will be very suitable. Therefore, it is hoped that a machine-made pottery factory will be established near the river in Jiujiang. According to the medium-scale plan, a capital of approximately four million silver dollars is required, of which 550,000 will be for real estate and machinery fixed capital, and 150,000 will be for circulating business capital. All equipment methods and profit budgets are listed below: (A) Factory Equipment (1) Clay Factory Building, one-story, construction materials cost 10,700 foreign yuan. Two sets each of coarse crushing machine, double-wheel dry grinding machine, and wheel grinding machine. One set each of automatic inclined clock vibration section and rotary section.

<p>Preserved in the People's Education Hall in Yuncheng</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, Han Dynasty paintings and ancient steles have been frequently discovered in the area north of Zichuan County, but most are incomplete. This spring, Li Guojie, a villager from Jia Ping Township north of the city, unearthed many bricks and stones while digging soil at the edge of the field. The township head, Che Chunyuan, believed that the bricks were all hemp bricks and the stone carvings had excellent patterns, presuming it was an ancient tomb. He immediately reported it to the People's Education Hall. On the 30th of last month, the director of the hall, Liu Kedian, together with Lu Hongzao and Meng Junsheng, members of the Antiquities Preservation Committee, personally went to investigate. They saw a total of six stones, on which were carved chariots, horses, people, and beasts, with vermilion color still discernible. They were also inscribed with the nine characters [These people and horses all eat from the Heavenly Spring Granary], confirming it to be a complete Han Dynasty tomb door. The hall has now negotiated with the Li family and will transport it to the city soon for preservation, so that those who study ancient history and culture can refer to it. (2nd)</p>

<p>In Zhengjiawan, the eighth picture of the twenty-eighth capital of Guangfu Township, at the home of villager Zheng A'er, seven or eight bandits arrived on the afternoon of the third, tied up Zheng A'er, and burned his wife, Zhu, in the breast area with fire, and beat his sister-in-law, Chen, in the waist. As a result, more than two hundred yuan of silver and clothing were robbed, and the bandits fled towards the edge of Taihu Lake.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Zhang Yipeng and others request tax reduction <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Local gentry Zhang Yipeng and others believe that the tax burden in Wuxian County is heavier than in other counties. When the field price was more than one hundred yuan per mu, it already exceeded one percent. Now that the rural areas are bankrupt and the field price has plummeted, each mu is only worth more than thirty foreign yuan, but the land price tax paid is still about one yuan and six jiao per mu, which the people cannot bear. They specially submitted a request to the provincial government's civil and financial departments yesterday (4th) to reduce it when compiling the budget for the 23rd year, so as to alleviate the people's burden.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Liu Zhuomin's case opens for trial; Gu Weilai comes to Wuxi for questioning <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since the Liu Zhuomin case occurred, involving Li Shuyun, the wife of former Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa, and her daughter, they were jointly interrogated and detained by the local court, which further triggered the issue of Gu Renfa's bigamy and marriage fraud. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday (4th) afternoon at 2 o'clock, the case was scheduled for court. The procuratorate had previously ordered Gu Renfa to be summoned to court for questioning. However, Gu had not arrived in Wuxi to report to the court by 5 o'clock. The Capital Supervisory Yuan believed that the case was serious and that although Gu Renfa had resigned to take responsibility, it was still necessary to impeach him according to law so as to give him appropriate punishment. Therefore, they specially sent two supervisory committee members (local people), Yang Tianji and Duan Honggang, to Wuxi to investigate yesterday morning. After arriving in Wuxi, the two stayed at Room 21 of the Washington Hotel. The county magistrate of this county, Yan Shenyu, went to the hotel to pay his respects upon hearing the news. Committee members Yang and others inquired in detail about the course of the case, and Magistrate Yan reported it one by one. Later, Magistrate Yan hosted a luncheon at the hotel. At 2:40 in the afternoon, Yan accompanied Yang and others to the county court to meet with Chief Procurator Qian Chengjun to inquire about everything and review the case files. Afterwards, they went to Huishan and other places to visit scenic spots. At 3:30, the Supervisory Yuan sent another investigation specialist, Ma Zhen [Zi Tailong], to Wuxi, who stayed at the Wuxi Hotel. After a short rest, he went directly to the county court and left after about half an hour. At about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Chief Qian opened the court for interrogation. In addition to Gu Renfa's failure to appear in court, those who were summoned and appeared in court included Zhang Yun, the police chief of the Public Security Bureau, and police officers Chen Hongjin, Liang Zhengshan, Chen Jimin, Ji Huashan, and Ge Deming. According to their testimony, when they searched Liu Zhuomin's residence at the Donghu Hotel on that day, they found two letters in his luggage, one addressed to a friend in Jiangxi and the other from Rong Zhen to her husband, Liu Zhuomin, as well as a blank sheet of paper with Gu Renfa's private seal on it, etc. As a result, the court ordered them all to be dismissed. After Li Shuyun was imprisoned, she hired two lawyers, Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun, to draft a complaint accusing Gu of bigamy and marriage fraud. Yesterday, Lawyer Chao came to Wuxi from Shanghai and met with Li Shuyun at the detention center. Li immediately urged Lawyer Chao to submit the complaint as soon as possible to redress her grievances. Lawyer Chao replied that this matter would be discussed with Lawyer Zhang before proceeding.</p>

<p>Jiang Jiangshi, a woman from Xihonglin in the 14th district of Wujin County, was naturally lewd and had an affair. Recently, she took advantage of her husband Jiang Xikun being bedridden and gave him poison to swallow, causing his death. She hastily prepared him for burial. Local people planned to come forward to report it, and it was then published in the newspaper. Yang Kongxi, the chief prosecutor of the county court, immediately sent police officers to the countryside to investigate the truth and took Jiang Jiangshi into custody for interrogation. Chief Yang also sent prosecutor Guan Junjie to lead forensic officers to the countryside on the 4th to open the coffin for autopsy to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Hu Jianchun, a prominent figure in Zhenjiang's business community, was upright and enthusiastic about public welfare. He dedicated almost all of his energy to social undertakings such as the water company, fire brigade, school, chamber of commerce, commercial group, and charity hall. Recently, due to overwork and mental weakness, and because the water company he ran lacked funds for development, he became weary of the world. He took poison at one o'clock in the morning on the 2nd. By the time his family discovered it, he was unconscious and beyond rescue. He died at eight o'clock in the morning on the 3rd at the age of 52. He had no personal debts. He listed all the various undertakings he ran in his will and entrusted friends to continue to maintain them. It is now scheduled to be placed in a coffin on the evening of the 4th.

<p>Salt merchants on the banks of Xiang, Hubei, West Anhui, and West Anhui appointed representatives last year to petition for the revocation of the order after the Ministry of Finance abolished the method of exempting tax supplements for submerged consumption. They spent months running around Beijing and Shanghai, but did not receive a response. This year, a new scale was adopted, and the government failed to clearly deduct the tare weight. Merchants used this as an excuse to attack and deduct the merchants' capital. The Ministry of Finance also imposed additional salt bank taxes, causing problems at all levels that could not be resolved. Recently, the Hunan Inspection Office forcibly ordered Hunan merchants to set up a Changsha salt sales office according to the Hubei bank method, prepay ten tax periods each month, and sell at reduced prices. The salt merchants believe that this is related to the survival of the business and that they are in danger of bankruptcy. Because the Salt Affairs Office and the Inspection Office convened various bank officials and staff in Nanjing for a meeting, the representatives went to Nanjing to petition. This shows the decline of commerce. It is unknown whether the authorities can understand the merchants' situation.</p>

The county was ordered to investigate, arrest, and interrogate. Specifically, on the morning of the 3rd, the county secretly dispatched the police team leader Zhu Hui and the political police chief Wang Dongchen to arrest and escort him to the county at the address. Director Tan interrogated him in court. Deng confessed that he was 20 years old, from Huangpi, Hubei. He used to be at the Chuanjiang Long Opium Company on Xin Shen Road in Hankou, collecting debts from sailors on various Yangtze River ships. He had come to Yangzhou and Zhenjiang to collect debts from sailors who owed money and could not go to Hankou to avoid them. He had just arrived in Yangzhou around the first month of the lunar year, intending to explore the debts. He also confessed the surnames Yao and Chen and planned to seek employment in Yangzhou. The interrogator asked whether he had relatives and friends, but Deng refused to confess and denied sending a letter to Hankou, saying that the handwriting could be compared. He was ordered to be handed over to the county detective team for detention pending verification.</p>

<p>Shen Ziru, a native of this county, has been working in Fujian political circles. During the 19th Route Army mutiny last year, Shen Ziru resolutely broke away from the rebel party, which was deeply trusted by his superiors. During the Qingming Festival this year, he took his family back to his hometown to visit his relatives. On the day before yesterday, he went to the countryside to sweep the tombs. When the boat passed Xiamu Lake, it was raining heavily and the northwest wind was strong, and the waves were raging. The boatman accidentally caused the boat to capsize. Shen Ziru and his wife both drowned because they did not know how to swim. The three boatmen were fortunately familiar with the water and survived. This is also very tragic.</p>

<p>Zhou Genfa and other boatmen from Changshu, who operated six rice boats from Shanghai to this county, were fully loaded with goods when they sailed to the vicinity of Suzhen at midnight on the 31st. Suddenly, two bandit boats came head-on, threatening to stop sailing with guns. More than a dozen bandits jumped out, looted the rice boats one by one, and all money and white rice were robbed. The boat crew was unable to resist and shouted for help. At that time, Wang, the village chief of Tagang Village, heard the sound and rang the gong. The farmers in the village woke up in shock and rushed to the scene of the incident, surrounding the bandit boat and fighting with the boat crew. The bandits gradually became unable to support themselves. The village chief encouraged his remaining courage and captured two bandits alive. Seeing that the bandit leader had been captured, the remaining bandits fled in droves. Not long after, one bandit was also chased and captured. The village chief immediately detained the three bandits and a bandit boat and handed them over to the local public security bureau, who transferred them to this county court for interrogation. They confessed that there were sixteen accomplices, staying in various districts of this county, suddenly looting. The authorities of this county specially ordered a unified and strict arrest yesterday.</p>

<p>The labor-capital dispute between weaving workers and management due to wage discounts has lasted for two months. Although the Party and government have repeatedly mediated, the workers have been difficult to resolve when they do not obey. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, the factory workers' forced shutdown of zero-machine workers resulted in a tragic incident. The circumstances are as follows: Huzhou weaving workers have always been divided into two types: factory workers and zero-machine workers. Since the wage discount labor-capital dispute, the factory workers have not resumed work. The zero-machine workers believe that although they are both weaving workers, they are forced to make a living. After the provincial party committee came to Huzhou to investigate, they followed the county government's instructions and resumed work first. The factory workers were very angry when they heard about it and went to stop them. The two sides had a conflict, injuring five zero-machine workers, and one person was arrested by the rebels. Therefore, each zero-machine household was in danger and went to the county government to request protection. After hearing the news, the county government immediately dispatched a task force to suppress the situation and rescue the arrested machine households. The large group of factory workers heard that the machine households had arrived at the county government, so they tracked them down. At that time, the county government gate had a task force guarding it. When the factory workers arrived, they were blocked by the team. At that time, there were too many people and the order was disrupted. There were rioters who intended to rush into the iron gate. The guards tried their best to stop them, but it was difficult to support them. There were even those who tried to grab guns. Seeing this dangerous situation, the task force fired into the air as a warning. Unexpectedly, the stray bullets from the gunfire killed two workers and injured one. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the factory workers were still unwilling to leave and were still demonstrating in the vicinity of the county government. At that time, each store saw that the order of the street was disrupted and heard gunshots, fearing that it would be affected, so they closed their doors one after another. By five o'clock in the afternoon, each street in the city was unusually calm. After the incident, County Magistrate Dai immediately reported to the provincial government by long-distance telephone. He also temporarily imposed martial law, ordering the military police to patrol closely, adding sentries near the county government, and posting notices to persuade the machine workers.</p>

<p>Guo Juren Lin Kefeng's third son, Mingshan, of the seventh district of Zhenhai, is over thirty years old. Because he does not engage in proper business, he is economically distressed. He often demanded from his father, resulting in discord between father and sons and brothers. The other day, Mingshan again asked his father for money. While they were arguing, his elder brother Xingmo happened to enter from outside, saw it, and scolded loudly. Therefore, there was an argument with Mingshan, followed by violence. After being persuaded by neighbors, they dispersed separately. However, Mingshan was unconvinced. Not long after, he returned, holding a pack of matches, full of anger, seeming to want to commit arson. At this time, his second brother Xinglian returned home and twisted Mingshan. For a time, the brothers twisted into a ball, fighting violently. Fortunately, relatives gave Mingshan two yuan to calm the matter. However, Mingshan hated his second brother even more. That night, Mingshan carried a sharp blade, but could not find Xingmo and Xinglian, unable to vent his hatred. The next day, he sought an excuse to intimidate his father with a knife. Fortunately, his father avoided him, unharmed. Kefeng could no longer bear it, so he consulted with relatives to discuss ways to expel him. Xingmo also gathered his cousins Yao Arong, blacksmith Hu Yangchun, and Wang Yichen, each hiding weapons. That evening, they rushed into Mingshan's room. At this time, Mingshan was already asleep. Hu Yangchun immediately hit Mingshan's head hard with an iron plate. Mingshan woke up in extreme pain and shouted for help. The family members were alarmed and rushed to see the situation, horrified, and hurriedly scolded and stopped them. However, the crowd was murderous and did not listen. They dragged Mingshan to the ground, first cutting off his two feet, then stuffing cotton into Mingshan's throat, and then using a hemp bag to store the corpse and dragged it to Xinqi tou and threw it on the beach. After the crowd of murderers returned home, they intimidated Ke Ling, forcing him to admit to killing his son. Ke Ming had no choice but to admit it with tears. As for Mingshan's corpse, because the east wind suddenly rose the day before yesterday, it had drifted away with the tide.</p>

<p>The Education Bureau previously received approval from the Ministry of Finance and Education in the spring of the 20th year to collect boat license donations to support educational expenses. The county committee Chen Zhao (ie Chen Sicao) was responsible for it. Since Chen took over, malpractices have been rampant, such as forging boat licenses and overcharging donations, totaling as much as 4,000 yuan. For a time, complaints were heard everywhere. The boat owners repeatedly filed complaints to the province and county. In January of this year, the county investigated and dismissed him, and Yang Douding was approved to take over. However, the boat owners believed that Yang was Chen Zhao's personal friend, and it would be difficult to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. They still unanimously expressed their opposition and petitioned the county government yesterday (2nd) to forward it to the provincial government to permanently abolish this boat license donation, so as to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>

The significance of Children's Day is to awaken the people of the nation, especially parents with children, to pay attention to loving and nurturing children. Children should be made aware of their relationship with the country and the nation. It must be understood that children belong to the country and society. The children of today are the future masters of China. They are the new hope for the life of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the survival of China and the safety of the nation's future depend entirely on the children of today. China has been weak to this day, and we are facing unprecedented national difficulties. If we want to save ourselves from this unprecedented national crisis, we must make the country rich and strong. If we want to make the country rich and strong, we must first revive the Chinese nation. In other words, reviving the Chinese nation is for the purpose of making China rich and strong. Only when China is rich and strong can we save ourselves from today's national crisis. Our China has a long and glorious history of more than four thousand years and is the earliest civilized nation in the world. If we can pay attention to the protection and education of children, and give them practical training in their thoughts, habits, bodies, and morals, thoroughly transform their lives, and fully develop their strengths, so that each and every child of today will become a healthy, powerful, and useful good citizen, and each generation will be stronger than the last, then I believe that not only can the national crisis be resolved, but our Chinese nation will also definitely be able to revive, and our China will definitely be able to become rich and strong. So, let us all wish the Republic of China a long life, the Chinese nation a long life, and the Chinese Nationalist Party a long life!"</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's Speech</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's speech briefly stated, "Today is April 4th, which is Chinese Children's Day. Our National Day is October 10th, which is called Double Ten Day, so Children's Day can also be called Double Four Day. The first four characters, namely food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, are our basic needs. All of you children are currently dependent on your families and parents. If there is no parental support, or if parents do not pay attention, danger will arise. Therefore, you must remember that you are receiving parental support at this moment, and in the future, when you grow up, you must work hard to repay the debt of today. The second four characters, namely intelligence, physical education, morality, and aesthetics, are the four educations. Adults train your bodies, cultivate your reading, tell you the principles of being a person, and cultivate your temperament, which are the four types of education: intelligence, physical education, morality, and aesthetics. Today, in commemorating Children's Day, we must pay close attention to the profound meaning of this Double Four Day."</p>
<p>Li Shizeng's Speech</p>
<p>Li Shizeng's speech briefly stated, "The importance of children is not only in China, but also highly valued internationally. Currently, the most central international organization in the world, Geneva, has established a world school, which is entirely composed of children around the age of ten. There are currently dozens of them who are receiving global knowledge there. The school authorities have expressed their hope that Chinese children will participate in enrollment. At that time, I established a Chinese Comrades Association of the World School there to solicit Chinese children to participate. Several people have already registered. Today, I take the opportunity to propose that the Municipal Government select representatives from the children attending the meeting today to study at the World School, as a commemoration of Children's Day. On behalf of the Chinese Comrades Association of the World School, I welcome participation."</p>

<p>Wu Xingya's Speech</p>
<p>Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said briefly in his speech, "Today, commemorating Children's Day is not just for you children to come and play, but it contains great significance. China's national crisis is serious, the nation is declining, and national humiliation is increasing. To resolve the national crisis, revive the nation, and wipe out national humiliation, middle-aged and elderly people need to stand on the front lines and make sacrifices, and to continue this spirit, it all depends on you children. You children should quickly train your bodies, study hard, enrich your knowledge, not waste precious time, and strictly observe order and respect teachers, so that in the future you can avenge your ancestors, build a new China, and make it a model Three Principles of the People country in the world."</p>
<p>Children's Speeches</p>
<p>Finally, Tao Jianming, a representative of the Shangwen Elementary School children, gave a speech on [Children and the New Life Movement], and Yi Mingwang, a representative of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union labor children, gave a speech, briefly stating that Children's Day is to break the adult's psychology of belittling children. Now we often see many labor children living miserable and uneducated lives on the streets or in their homes. There are 800,000 workers in Shanghai, and with an average of two children per person, there are over a million ignorant children. On this Children's Day, we hope that the Municipal Government and enthusiastic gentlemen in children's affairs will promote labor children's education and seek happiness for labor children." Immediately afterwards, slogans were shouted, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Telegrams of Congratulations from Various Places</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong Children's Celebration Association sent a telegram saying, "[Wishing all children in the country good health]." 43,242 children in Kaifeng, Henan, also telegraphed various newspapers to convey their congratulations to the children across the country, expressing their wishes.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Telegram</p>
<p>Minister Kong Xiangxi was unable to come to Shanghai from Beijing due to official duties to participate in Children's Day and specially telegraphed Mayor Wu to deliver the following speech on his behalf: "Because there are many helpless children in our country, scattered everywhere, I gathered comrades six years ago and organized the China Child Welfare Association to implement protection, relief, hygiene, and other work, and to awaken the public's responsibility for children. With the approval of the National Government, April 4th of each year was designated as Children's Day. Today is the third anniversary, and celebrations are being held everywhere in the country to commemorate it. It is true that children are the future masters of the country. If they do not receive perfect education and nurturing during their childhood, how can they bear great responsibility in the future? Therefore, those who are responsible for promoting this cause should urgently awaken the people of the country to pay attention to children's affairs, so that everyone has the concept of loving children and bears the responsibility of loving children. At the same time, we should also make children across the country understand their own position, and strive to improve themselves in order to cultivate noble personalities. This is my original aspiration when I founded Children's Day. I hope that all comrades and children across the country will work hard."</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>After the celebration ceremony, it rained, so the venue was changed to the Municipal Government Auditorium. Mayor Wu hosted a reception for all the children in the city. First, Mayor Wu delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating, "Dear children, we hold a Children's Day commemorative meeting every year on April 4th, and the Municipal Government hosts a reception for children once a year, so that we can remember at all times on Children's Day that the Chinese nation has a glorious history of thousands of years and is the earliest civilized nation in the world. Therefore, we are confident that by gathering the intelligence and talent of 400 million people across the country, we can definitely revive the nation and save it from national crisis, but this responsibility must be borne by the people of the country and continue to work hard, especially since children are the lifeblood of the Chinese nation. My holding Children's Day commemoration every year is to awaken citizens to love and educate children."</p>
<p>Children's Reply</p>
<p>Next, Cao Xigang, a children's representative from Danhua Elementary School, delivered a reply, briefly stating, "Chairman, gentlemen, today we are holding a celebration for Children's Day, and we are grateful for the mayor's presentation of commemorative badges and his invitation for us to visit the various departments of the Municipal Government. The children are very grateful. Now, on behalf of all the children in the city, I would like to bow to the mayor to express our gratitude, and also to express that we have accepted the mayor's instructions."</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The congress hall was set up in the auditorium on the second floor of Huesha, with a white cloth banner that read [Children’s Day Commemorative Congress Organized by the Women’s National Goods Year Movement Committee]. The center of the auditorium was the rostrum, and the surroundings were covered with slogans. A recreation market was set up on the ground floor, where the daughters of Huang Renzhi, Miss Pan Yangyao, served as mayors, entertaining the children with games. Hundreds of educational toys and children’s gifts were displayed. Another model family was set up, with bedrooms, kitchens, and living rooms arranged in a simple and beautiful way. On the second floor, a home affairs guidance service was set up, supervised by Zhu Wang Huanqing, where people could ask for advice. Health competitions, vaccination rooms, and bathrooms were also set up on the second floor, supervised by the Health Bureau, and children could participate for free.</p>
<p>Celebration</p>
<p>The meeting to celebrate started at 2 pm. The presidium consisted of seven people: Mrs. Wu, wife of Mayor Wu, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Mrs. Huang Renzhi, Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Ms. Lin Kecong, Ms. Shu Huizhen, and Ms. Huang Bingpei. The master of ceremonies was Li Manyun, the recorder was Cheng Geng, and the receptionists were Yang Meizhen, Chen Cuiheng, etc. After performing the rituals, Lin Kecong, the chairman, reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei and Cai Yuanpei, Yan Duhe, Pan Yangyao, Liu Wang Liming, Yan Junxuan, etc., gave speeches. Next, motions were discussed and prizes were awarded for essays. Finally, entertainment was performed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Lin Kecong, the chairman, reported, “Today is the fourth Children’s Day. When we commemorate Children’s Day, we should understand the meaning of Children’s Day. The China Child Welfare Association, in view of the fact that countries around the world pay great attention to children’s affairs, specially designated a Children’s Day. Therefore, the Child Welfare Association also submitted a request to the National Government in March of the 20th year to designate April 4th as Children’s Day. So today’s celebration can also be said to be the third anniversary. All of you children are the masters of the country, and are closely related to the strength or weakness of the country. The 20th century is the century of children. If we want to save China from danger and revive the Republic of China, we must make children healthy. Therefore, today, when we celebrate Children’s Day, we should awaken the people of the country to love children, and make sure that they are fully developed physically and intellectually, especially teachers and parents who are responsible for education. As for the general poor and homeless children, we should ask the government to find ways to provide relief and shelter, so that they can all develop healthy bodies and patriotic thoughts."</p>
<p>Speeches from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, briefly stating that various countries have Children’s Day, but the date is different for each country. Children’s Day in China is in the late spring, which implies a thriving intention. However, when we commemorate Children’s Day here, children, do not forget the pain of the January 28th Shanghai War. First, do not use foreign goods. Second, cultivate profound knowledge and forge a healthy body, and prepare to avenge yourselves in the future. (2) Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, briefly stating that today is Children’s Day, and it is also National Goods Year. Today's celebration is organized by the Women's National Goods Year Committee, so I would like to especially mention the issue of national goods. Children, please keep using national goods in your hearts at all times. (3) Yan Duhe gave a speech, briefly stating that today's meeting is different from ordinary meetings. Usually, only parents bring children to participate, but today the children bring their parents to play. But why do we have a meeting to celebrate Children's Day? There is a major significance in this, because the children of today are the masters of the future. Childhood is the budding age. It is useless without good cultivation. Therefore, the responsibility of cultivation should be on the parents and teachers. Furthermore, this congress is organized by the Women's National Goods Year Committee, so I hope that parents will provide children with national goods, so that they can be complete national goods children. The following are speeches by Pan Yangyao, Liu Wang Liming, and Yan Junxuan, etc., omitted.</p>
<p>Passed Proposals</p>
<p>After the speeches, four proposals were discussed and unanimously passed by the whole house as follows: 1. Please the government to allocate funds to provide relief to homeless children. 2. Please the government to order all factories to set up nurseries. 3. Please the government to stipulate that the lion dance be the emblem for children. 4. Please the government to implement compulsory education for children.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie Left Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning, Paid Respects to the War Zone</p>
<p>Noon, Public Banquet from the Business Community</p>
<p>Evening, Took the Express Train to Beijing</p>
<p>According to the Industrial Association, the China General Chamber of Industry, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, various organizations, as well as Wing On Textile Company, China Tobacco Company, China Stone Company, etc., held a banquet yesterday noon at the Wing On Textile Second Factory in Wusong Yunzaobang, to welcome Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie. The host and guest arrived together at twelve o'clock. Mayor Shen felt somewhat burdened by the receptions he had received from various circles in recent days, so no welcoming ceremony was held. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Yesterday's attendees included Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Qian Chengxu of the China General Chamber of Industry, Zhang Zemin of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, Guo Shun of Wing On Textile Mill, Hu Xiyuan of Asia-Pacific Electric Company, Lin Dazhong of Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Plant, Zhang Jiongbo of China Tobacco Company, Li Yuncheng of China Gas Company, Chen Shouchang, Wang Yaochen of Fuxin Flour Company, Tao Guilin of China Stone Company, Zhu Jingan of Litai Textile Company, Zhu Gengtao of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Feng Ziyuan of Shanxi Xinjiang Dayisheng Textile Company, among more than thirty others.</p>
<p>Guo Shun's Speech</p>
<p>Because no ceremony was held, the host, Guo Shun, simply delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Two years ago, at Mayor Shen's invitation, we went to Qingdao to inspect the municipal administration. When we parted, we promised to return the visit to the South. Now, Mayor Shen has graciously fulfilled the promise before we even dared to hope for his arrival. The wise host of the past is now the honored guest of today. To gather together is truly a rare occasion. Mayor Shen studied abroad in his early years, delving into economics and political science. Upon returning to China, he made a name for himself wherever he went. In governing Qingdao, he has gradually implemented and brought to scale various projects, such as municipal engineering and harbor construction. As for the rural areas outside the city, he had not yet started. Therefore, in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China, he established construction offices in various rural districts, including Licun, Cangkou, Jiushui, Yindao, and Xuejiadao, to work closely with the people. To this day, Qingdao's municipal construction policies and rural construction plans have reached their third phase. All efforts to develop the people's livelihood, prepare for self-governance, popularize education, maintain public order, facilitate transportation, and promote agriculture, everything to transform, educate, nourish, and benefit the people, have been fully prepared. This is what we have all witnessed and heard during our recent inspection of Qingdao, and it is also the unanimous judgment of the Chinese and foreign press, repeatedly reported in the newspapers. There is no need for us to specifically promote Mayor Shen. According to Mayor Shen himself, Qingdao has become a center of domestic production with its numerous factories. However, while various circles have a strong interest in knowledge and research on industrial economics, they lack adequate understanding. Therefore, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he established two organizations in Qingdao. The one for research gathers domestic experts to form the Qingdao Industrial and Commercial Society, allocating substantial funding each month to support research, statistics, and investigations. The one for municipal design establishes the Qingdao Prosperity Promotion Association, hiring Mr. Chen Guangfu of Shanghai and others to synthesize its accomplishments. It is expected that within half a year, there will be significant construction discoveries. After that time, railways and shipping can be used for large-scale connections, and the foundation between the economies of Shanghai and Qingdao will also be completed. In short, Mayor Shen's only ambition and purpose is to do things practically and not engage in empty habits. We can see his inner richness today, which can be expressed in his ample style." Afterwards, Mayor Shen responded to the warm hospitality from all circles and invited everyone present to visit Qingdao before July 30th this summer and led them to Boshan and other places to inspect the glass and electrical industries in preparation for future development.</p>
<p>Shen's Remarks</p>
<p>After the banquet, Mr. Shen shared with reporters the various reasons why China's industry and commerce could not prosper: "Modern countries all base their national establishment on industry and commerce as the foundation of production. China's industrial and commercial undertakings are heading towards collapse. Is this due to lagging behind the times or oppression from the environment? In abstract terms, it is nothing more than the following points: First, entrepreneurs have unclear concepts. Modern industry and commerce do not seek short-term gains, while Chinese people seek profit from their capital. Modern industry and commerce are pragmatic, while Chinese people often rely on luck. Modern industry and commerce must understand the truth of supply and demand, while Chinese people have no statistics. Modern industry and commerce take profits as their profits, while Chinese people are selfish. Modern industry and commerce value continuous permanence, while Chinese people prefer the present. Modern industry and commerce emphasize substance, while Chinese people like to forge. Modern industry and commerce should perfect science, while Chinese people regard it as ordinary affairs. All of these are because Chinese people do not have a clear understanding of modern industry and commerce, so even with new materials, it is difficult to obtain a new spirit. Secondly, the cultivation of employees is insufficient. Modern industry and commerce value economic control, but there are not many talents who seek the overall situation. Modern industry and commerce need excellent workers, but the training of workers is insufficient. The so-called insufficient cultivation is not only in the intellectual aspect, but also in the moral aspect. In recent years, advertisements for the arrest of escaped partners, news of laziness and abandonment of work, and unexpected losses suffered by factories and shops have been frequently reported in newspapers. The old-time industrialists and merchants still knew to value trust, responsibility, frugality, diligence, endurance, and poverty. Now, they have failed to remedy the weaknesses of the old-style industry and commerce, but have first abandoned its advantages, resulting in more internal disputes, and the business is even more affected. Thirdly, the environment cannot help. The organization of modern society is intricate, and there is no relationship that is not interconnected. The expansion of one part always depends on the establishment of another part. For example, industry first emphasizes tools, and tools first emphasize hardware, so foreign countries always take the coal and iron industries as the center of industry, and the needs of coal and iron for various industries cannot be counted. If one of the components is not prepared, it is enough to change the overall situation. This is only in terms of the relationship between industrial systems. As for various undertakings other than industry and commerce, they all have a cooperative relationship with industry and commerce. For example, if education is poor, morals will be degraded and knowledge will be superficial; if politics and law are poor, life and property will lose their protection; if transportation is poor, transportation will be difficult; if agricultural products are poor, raw materials will be lacking. It is known that the industry and commerce itself and the environment of industry and commerce must be improved at the same time. Otherwise, if everyone speaks in unison, it will eventually be deteriorated by the environment. In short, if the concept is not correct, the policy will be wrong; if morality and knowledge are lacking, the undertaking will lose its basis; if the environment is scattered and not connected, the foundation will not be established. These three are the general causes of business failure, and industry and commerce are no exception."</p>
<p>Returned to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Mayor Shen, accompanied by Wang Xiaolai, Guo Shun, and others, went to Wusong Fort Taiwan, Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang, and other places to visit the traces of the Songhu War. In the afternoon, Qian Chengxu, Lin Dazhong, Hu Xiyuan, and others led them to Jungong Road to visit the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Plant. Originally, he intended to visit the war zones in Zhabei and Jiangwan, but due to rain, he returned to the New Asia Hotel residence at about 4 p.m. He then took the night express train at 11 p.m., accompanied by staff members Guo Binghe and Liu Jingxi, and others, back to Beijing. Those who went to see him off included Wang Xiaolai, Qian Chengxu, Guo Shun, and dozens of representatives from the municipal government and others. Shen will stay in Beijing for about two days and will take a train on the morning of the 7th to return directly to Qingdao.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Wife of U.S. Consul General Cunningham Passed Away in Hangzhou Yesterday Morning <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Acquaintances Mourn</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham, the U.S. Consul General stationed in Shanghai, accompanied his wife by car to Hangzhou for a tour during the Easter holiday. They were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai a few days ago, but on Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Cunningham suddenly fell ill with a cold and was admitted to the China Inland Mission Hospital for treatment. Mr. Cunningham then called the Consulate General's office, saying that due to his wife's illness, they had to postpone their return to Shanghai. In addition to being treated in Hangzhou, a doctor from Shanghai was also sent to Hangzhou to diagnose and treat her. However, yesterday morning, Mr. Cunningham informed Consul Josselyn in Shanghai via long-distance telephone that his wife's condition was serious and he could not specify when they would return to Shanghai. Shortly after 11:00 a.m., another telephone call came, saying that Mrs. Cunningham had passed away. The nature of her illness remains unknown. The date of the funeral will be announced after it has been determined. Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham have been married for over twenty years. Mrs. Cunningham always accompanied Mr. Cunningham wherever he went. They first went to Mumbai, then to Singapore, then to Hankou in 1914. In November 1919, Mr. Cunningham was transferred to Shanghai. Having traveled to Shanghai for more than ten years, he has a wide circle of friends among Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, the sudden news of his wife's death has caused great grief among his acquaintances. Mrs. Cunningham was born on January 1, 1886.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Grain and Rice Industry Re-Telegrams Guangdong, Requesting Unified Collection of Tariffs on Imported Rice <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>National Consistency is Appropriate</p>
<p>The Whole People Will Benefit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Association and the Bean and Rice Trade Association, noting that although the government has issued regulations for the collection of tariffs on imported rice, the tax rate in Guangdong Province has not yet been unified, previously telegraphed the Guangdong authorities, requesting approval for unification, in order to prevent imported rice from avoiding higher taxes and being imported from Guangdong Province in large quantities, thereby encroaching on the value of domestic rice and affecting the rural economy. One month has passed without a reply. Therefore, yesterday, they re-telegraphed Chen Jitang, reiterating their previous request. The original telegram is as follows: "In recent years, China's rural areas have collapsed, and crises are imminent. The government and the public are unanimously planning relief measures, and preventing the sale of imported rice is considered the most important measure. Guangdong Province, with its foresight, took the lead in advocating this and specially established the Bureau of Special Taxes on Imported Agricultural Products on September 16 of last year to levy import taxes on imported rice at one yuan per picul, thereby resisting the onslaught of foreign rice and seeking an outlet for the surplus grain in the Yangtze River provinces. Its grand plans are widely admired. In December, the government ordered all provinces and customs to levy new taxes on imported rice, but Guangdong Province was exempted because it had already established a special bureau. However, the tax rate in Guangdong Province is only one-third of the customs duty. As a result, foreign merchants avoid the heavier taxes and, having failed in other provinces, flock to Guangdong, taking advantage of the loopholes to enter in a steady stream. According to statistics, in January and February of this year, there were as many as sixteen ships carrying imported rice into Guangdong Province, and the same is likely true in March. If the loopholes are not plugged, the overall effect will not be seen. Is this the original intention of Guangdong Province to establish a bureau to levy taxes and relieve the rural areas? Therefore, this association telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Government in February, requesting approval for a unified tax rate. The Political Affairs Committee replied that it would await the provincial government's review and decision. However, for a month, the Chinese people have been waiting with anticipation, hoping for good news from the south, but no decree has been issued, causing deep anxiety. Today, the great powers are pursuing their dumping policies, seeking world markets. China, with its backward industry, is well-suited to supply them. The excess of industrial products has already damaged our rights, and the invasion of agricultural products has shaken the foundations of the country. Therefore, raising tariffs to strengthen our defenses should be done consistently across the country. Now, because one side of the net is still sparse and the success of nine mountains has not been completed, the rice-producing areas in the Yangtze River region are sitting idle, unsold, and the price is trending even lower, causing the people to suffer even more. If Guangdong Province unifies the tax rate and jointly implements preventative measures, the people in Guangdong will abandon imported rice and choose domestic rice, without any losses. Domestic rice will be unhindered, benefiting the entire population. Mutual assistance is valued in both ancient and modern times. We have always admired Guangdong Province as the source of revolutionary strategies, and the patriotic people and caring authorities will surely consider the overall situation and be happy to promote it. Therefore, we reiterate our heartfelt request and urge you to immediately inform the Guangdong Provincial Government to increase the tariff on imported rice in accordance with the current import tariff rate. We await your orders with trepidation. Respectfully, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Association and the Bean and Rice Trade Association."</p>

<h3 id="e131">After the Water Price of Tap Water is Reduced by 20% <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>It is Said that the People's Price</p>
<p>Is Still Below the Production Cost</p>
<p>The Public Relations Office of the Public Concession Board of Directors released a statement saying that a news item about the tap water price published in various newspapers in the city on the 28th of last month was not in line with the facts. The relevant parties issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>Since April of last year, the public concession's tap water has implemented a scientific water rate calculated by water meters, with the intention of providing relief to poor users. However, last year, some alleyway houses consumed a large amount of water, and the fees were paid by the landlords, who were temporarily given a discount. At the end of the year, a survey found that more than half of these alleyway houses had landlords whose water fees were within 7.5% of the rental value. The current water price has no other discount except for the recently announced 20% discount to be implemented from April 1 of this year. The 20% discount is a uniform reduction of 20% on the bill. If the consumption of various alleyway houses is the same as last year, then after the 20% discount is implemented, it is estimated that about 65 out of every 100 alleyway houses will have water fees that are below 7.5% of the rental value. The production cost of the tap water company, including capital interest and operating expenses, is 3.1 cents per thousand gallons. After the 20% discount, for those with a rent of 25 yuan or less, the water price paid per thousand gallons is still less than 3.1 cents. This type of tenant accounts for about 400,000 people, which shows that a large portion of the citizens are paying a price for water that is still below the production cost.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Li Pingheng and Cheng Haifeng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Implementation Steps of Factory Inspection</p>
<p>After the Central Factory Inspection Office decided on the implementation procedures for factory inspection and promoted it in five stages, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to comply. Li Pingheng, Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Cheng Haifeng, Section Chief of the Inspection Office, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The City Complies</p>
<p>After the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received the Municipal Government's order to forward the implementation procedures for factory inspection, it immediately handed it over to the Factory Inspection Section for compliance. A reporter from the New Voice Society met with Tian Heqing, Director of the Factory Inspection Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the factory inspection will be carried out in stages in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Central Factory Inspection Office. As for the various tasks specified in the first stage, some have already been implemented within the urban area, and it has now been decided to handle them separately in accordance with the various items specified in the first stage.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai for Negotiations</p>
<p>Li Pingheng, Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Cheng Haifeng, Section Chief of the Central Factory Inspection Office, arrived in Shanghai together from Beijing yesterday morning. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Cheng Haifeng went to the city center to discuss Shanghai factory inspection matters with Tian Heqing, Director of the Factory Inspection Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others. The meeting ended at 5:00 p.m. It is reported that at the upcoming International Labor Conference, Li Pingheng will represent the government, and Cheng Haifeng will be the advisor to labor representative An Futing. They will also sail from Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Rosso on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Implementation Steps</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society met with Cheng Haifeng at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to him, the Central Factory Inspection Office, in view of the fact that China's factory production is not only backward but also declining, has specially formulated the implementation procedures for factory inspection and is promoting it in stages. However, the necessary steps for implementing factory inspection are: (1) Explanation: Explain the Factory Law to both labor and management in each factory so that they obey and comply with it. (2) Persuasion: If the factories do not make corrections after the explanation, they will be persuaded to make corrections. (3) Warning: If the factories still do not make corrections after being persuaded, they will be warned. (4) Punishment: If the factories do not listen to the warning, they will be punished according to the law. The above items are all educational work to make the factories understand, so that the implementation of factory inspection is easier, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Qian Chengxu Discusses Trademark Opinions <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after several days of exchanging opinions between the industrial and commercial circles on the issue of trademark recognition of font and non-recognition of pronunciation, it is believed that for domestic goods factories whose trademarks have already gained a considerable position in the market, most advocate that in addition to the font, there must be appropriate remedies for the pronunciation. If this proposition is to be thoroughly implemented, the trademark law must be fundamentally revised. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Qian Chengxu of the China General Chamber of Industry, asking for his opinion on this legal amendment and how it can be remedied. Today, the Ministry of Justice has established a statutory interpretation. According to Qian, "I went to Beijing the day before yesterday and discussed this matter several times with the government, but the opinions were not consistent. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry will send Director Liang Shangdong to Shanghai in the coming days to discuss it with the industrial and commercial circles. In my personal opinion, although Western trademark laws all recognize the font but not the pronunciation, Western alphabets have a fixed pronunciation. Besides this one sound, it is difficult to find a second sound. Therefore, in fact, it emphasizes the form, but the pronunciation does not change, which means that it recognizes the form and the pronunciation, emphasizing both directly and indirectly. The law does not need to add any regulations on the point of recognizing the pronunciation. However, in the Chinese language, one sound can find many characters with the same meaning. At this time when domestic goods are not yet developed, advocating equal emphasis on sound and form does not seem to be without a reasonable reason. In short, in all circumstances, the representative of the Ministry of Industry will come to Shanghai in the coming days, and everyone can discuss it in detail. During this period, the China General Chamber of Industry has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations and companies, asking them to sign their opinions. Once all the opinions are collected, a meeting will be held to jointly study the matter with the representative of the Ministry of Industry."</p>

<h3 id="e134">A Red Pill Manufacturing Organization Was Cracked Down in Junle Village, Edward Road <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Another Distribution Point was Set Up in Ruiyou Tian Candy Shop</p>
<p>The Police Twice Went to Buy and Detained Four Suspects, Male and Female</p>
<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the anti-narcotics department of the General Patrol Bureau, recently learned that the Fujian gang was secretly selling red pills in the side rooms of the Ruiyou Tian Candy and Meat Floss Shop at 1376 Edward Road, while the manufacturing organization was set up in the four-story building of Dr. Zhang Xiux　at No. 6 Junle Village, nearby. The sales were quite extensive. The price was at least 40 yuan for 10,000 pills, i.e., ten bags. Therefore, on the 31st of last month, he secretly dispatched informants with 40 yuan to buy ten bags of red pills at No. 1376 Edward Road. Again, at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, he dispatched informants with 40 yuan in cash, pre-marking the banknotes, to buy ten bags of red pills. At the same time, he reported to the First Special District Court for a search warrant and, in conjunction with Western Detective Krebs and Chinese Detective Chen Yaoting, went to No. 1376 to detain Xiao Cai (i.e., Li Cai) from Fuzhou, Wang Zhongyou from Xiamen, Zhong Tianming from this locality, and Xiao Zhang氏, a Fuzhou woman. The original stolen banknotes with the markings, totaling 40 yuan, were found on Xiao Cai. They then went to No. 6 Junle Village and seized 28 pounds of red pills, a set of red pill manufacturing equipment, three bags of white powder, four taels of red pills, one bag of heroin, raw materials, utensils, and silver dollars, which were all taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian then rose and described the details of the case:</p>
<p>It was stated that since receiving the report, the police sent people to buy red pills on March 30 and April 3, each time for 40 yuan, and purchased ten bags of red pills, totaling 10,000 pills. The first payment was handed over to the defendant Xiao Cai, who took out the key from his side and gave it to the defendant Xiao Zhang氏 to go out. After ten minutes, she brought the red pills back. The second time, the police marked the banknotes of 40 yuan in advance and gave them to Xiao Cai, but the defendant Wang Zhongyou went out and brought them back. Therefore, when the police went to arrest them, the original stolen 40 yuan was found on Xiao Cai, and the key was found on Wang. The police still need to investigate the case in detail, so the four defendants have not been formally charged and they request permission to detain them first, etc. They then presented the seized items to the court. When Xiao Cai was interrogated, his confession was cunning and he refused to confess the truth. Wang Zhongyou confessed that he was a cook at the place and had only been there for eight days, with a monthly salary of three yuan. The key was given to him by Xiao Shipin, who was at large, who instructed him to take the red pills from No. 6 Junle Village. He knew nothing about the rest. Zhong Tianming confessed that he went there yesterday to find his classmate Xiao Cai, who was arrested. Xiao Zhang氏 confessed that she rented the front side room at No. 1376 Edward Road, and the red pills were sold by Xiao Shipin, who lived in the back side room, for only two or three days. He asked me to take care of it for him and gave me ten yuan, etc. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered that the four defendants be detained and interrogated again on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Number of Vendors at the Jing'an Temple Fair This Year Will Be Restricted <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Bathing Buddha Festival Fair was recently discussed by the Concession Bureau's Security Committee. According to the police department's report, the location of the stalls this year will be designated by the Works Department, and more police officers will be dispatched to patrol in order to prevent encroachment. The abbot of the temple also admitted that there have been too many stalls in recent years and is willing to assist the police department in restricting the stall locations. If the Concession Bureau issues a public announcement, the abbot is willing to issue licenses to the vendors in order to facilitate the crackdown. The number of stalls at the fair was 3,000 in 1932 and increased to 4,700 last year. The original intention of the fair was for villagers to sell their products, but in recent years, the vendors have often been residents of the concession or Nanshi in the city, which is contrary to the original intention. The Concession Bureau has been paying attention to the restriction of stalls for many years, so the committee, after deliberation, agreed that the fair should be limited to genuine villagers selling their handmade goods and, in view of the needs of public health and traffic convenience, it is proposed to follow the police department's proposal: (1) Limit the number of stalls to 1,500 and only allow the sale of handmade goods. (2) Announce this decision as soon as possible and order the police department and the abbot of the temple to agree on a detailed plan. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors of the Concession Bureau on April 4 and was approved.</p>

<p>Two Mounds Leveled, Remains' Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>After Repeated Investigation, Grave Keeper Found to Have Illegally Sold Cemetery Land</p>
<p>Zhou Wenrui and Zhou Wenjun, residents of Daokou Lane in this city, had an ancestral burial ground located behind the Qu Zhenren Temple in the thirteenth district, measuring five fen in area. It contained six coffins, dating back over a hundred years. Now that the Qingming Festival has arrived, the Zhou family members went to the tomb to pay their respects and sweep the graves a few days ago. Upon reaching the site, they were shocked to find that both mounds had been leveled, transformed into an open space. The whereabouts of the remains were unknown. The Zhou brothers were extremely grief-stricken and immediately investigated the matter on the spot. They learned that the grave had been excavated by Shengfa, the son of the tomb caretaker, Zhu Yatou. The remains had been discarded, and the land had been illegally sold by Zhu Shengfa for profit. Outraged, Zhou Wenrui and others went to the local court prosecutor's office to file a complaint, which has been accepted, and summons for questioning are being issued.</p>

<p>Seven Chinese Passengers Plunge into a Small River</p>
<p>Westerners Rescue with a Small Boat</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that during the Easter holidays, Westerners from this port flocked to Hangzhou for sightseeing. Mr. and Mrs. Barraclough were among them. After their trip, the Barracloughs were returning to Shanghai by car on Sunday when a large car carrying seven Chinese passengers sped past them. After passing Minhang by about three miles, the car, for some unknown reason, suddenly veered off the road, crossed a steep embankment, and plunged into a small river beside the road. Shortly after, the Barracloughs' car arrived and saw five Chinese standing on the side of the car in the river. Two others, unable to climb out, were sitting on the car cushions with only their heads above the water. Several farmers stood on the embankment, watching from a distance. The Barracloughs, after arriving at the scene, were soon joined by several other foreigners. They worked together to carry out the rescue, finding a small boat to bring everyone ashore. When asked about the incident last night, Mr. Barraclough replied that he could not find anyone who witnessed the accident, so he did not know the details. The people who fell into the river were too shocked to recount what happened. It seems that the windows of the car were closed, allowing the people inside to open the doors and climb out before the car filled with water. Everyone suffered minor injuries and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. According to the hospital, most of the injuries were scrapes and cuts. However, one woman had three teeth knocked out, and one man suffered severe eye injuries that may lead to blindness.</p>

<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, because of the Yellow River flood, with the riverine hinterlands of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces suffering tragic submersion, specially initiated a Huang River flood agricultural relief fundraising campaign last winter. To alleviate the submerged disaster, the Shanghai office of the commission, located on the sixth floor of the Guohua Building at 356 Beijing Road, compiled and distributed donation registers to solicit contributions from all sectors of society. It is now learned that Mr. Du Yuesheng of this city, recognizing that spring plowing is approaching and that agricultural relief work is actively underway, specially donated 1,000 yuan yesterday (the 4th), sending it to the commission's Shanghai office for remittance to the disaster area to carry out agricultural relief. It is also reported that the commission has received a total of over 130,000 yuan in donations from various sources. Agricultural relief work has already been extended to Heze in Shandong, and Puyang, Dongming, and Changyuan in Hebei, and Kaocheng, Lanfeng, and Huaxian in Henan, totaling seven counties. In addition to allocating 20,000 yuan each to Heze and Dongming, and 10,000 yuan each to Changyuan and Kaocheng, another 10,000 yuan was allocated to Changyuan and Kaocheng, 20,000 yuan each to Huaxian and Puyang, and 10,000 yuan to Lanfeng, for a total of 130,000 yuan allocated for relief.</p>

<p>Among the defendants in the Megali Bank embezzlement case in this port is Englishman Mack, 52 years old, a businessman in Shanghai. After a preliminary hearing by the British Consulate Police Court in Shanghai, he was sent to the British Supreme Court for trial. The hearing was opened by Justice Moss the day before yesterday, and continued in the afternoon until 5:35 PM before adjourning. The jurors were Natcai and four others. The prosecuting attorney was Mr. Puller-Aisworth, representing the Crown, and the defendant's lawyer was Mr. Hatop. Mr. Puller presented three counts of the defendant's crimes, detailing the circumstances of the police court hearing, and briefly outlined the defendant's charges to the jurors, taking two hours. After the statement was completed, the defendant denied the crime. Then, witnesses were called. All the witnesses said was the same as reported in the previous newspapers. The defendant's lawyer did not refute it much. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing resumed to hear the witnesses. It is expected that after two or three more hearings, the case can be closed and a verdict reached. The defendant was previously released on bail in the police court, but this time the judge ordered the defendant to be detained after adjourning the court.

<p>Ticket Number [12161] Bought at the Insistence of a Friend</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Grand Champagne horse race, organized by the International Sports Association, was held on the 2nd of this month. The winning ticket number was 12161. According to reliable sources, the winner of the first prize this time is an Englishman, A.H. Leslie. Mr. Leslie has held important positions at Jardine Matheson and the Public Omnibus Company, and has lived in Shanghai for more than twenty years. It is said that his winning the first prize this time was quite a coincidence. He had already bought five champagne tickets, but on the morning of the race (April 2nd), a friend insisted on selling him another ticket. Mr. Leslie, out of courtesy, reluctantly accepted it. Unexpectedly, the number drawn in the afternoon, [12161], was indeed the first prize, winning a large sum of money. It was the ticket that his friend insisted he buy. None of the five tickets he had already bought won anything. According to the superstitious notions of the Chinese people, it can be said that "wealth and nobility are predetermined; windfall fortunes do not favor the poor."</p>

<p>Had Entered into a Temporary Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Died of Heart Failure After the Contract Expired</p>
<p>Regarding the discovery of an unidentified female corpse on Wusong Road, Chang'an Lane, as reported yesterday, according to the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, the corpse was identified by the Japanese Consulate General as Park Yong-seong, a Korean who worked as a prostitute. She entered into a four-year temporary marriage contract with Li Yuanxue, residing at 87 Yuan Chang Road, Xihua De Road, for 200 yuan. Afterwards, she continued to secretly prostitute herself in Shanghai. In February of this year, her contract with Li expired, and she left Li's house, residing at 239 Shou Chun North Lane, Miller Road. Due to suffering from lung disease, heart disease, opium poisoning, and syphilis, she could not receive customers. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, at 3 p.m., she visited her acquaintance Chiyo, known for her prostitution, who resided at 15 Chang'an Lane, after which her whereabouts became unknown. According to a doctor's diagnosis, although she died of heart failure, it is estimated that her time of death was around 6 a.m. on the 3rd. Therefore, her actions after the evening of the 1st are particularly unclear. It is suspected that the body was abandoned. Currently, the Japanese Consulate General Police, together with the Shanghai Municipal Police, have begun investigating the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Joint Association Sends Letters Urging Member Groups to Pay Fees <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, the Association's Finances Will Be Unsustainable, Leading to Dissolution</p>
<p>The Fiscal Year Is Approaching, Tax Regulations May Be Changed, Responsibilities Are Heavy</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association was established last year during the tax bureau's reform of new regulations. At that time, the tobacco and alcohol industry associations in various cities and counties believed that the new regulations were harmful and disruptive to businesses, and they strongly advocated for reform. However, due to legal restrictions, their efforts were unsuccessful. Recently, member groups have been even more in arrears with their membership fees, resulting in financial difficulties for the association and making it unsustainable. It was decided to appoint economic committee members in different districts to be responsible for collecting fees. Yesterday, Dai Zhuo'an, standing committee member and economic committee member for the eighth district, sent a letter to the economic committee members of each district, explaining that in the coming year, tax authorities, due to unsatisfactory tax revenue reforms, will once again change the plan. The work of the joint association remains very important. He hoped to explain the advantages and disadvantages to each member group, and jointly maintain the overall situation. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, it has been nine months since the establishment of our association. Economic expenditures have been increasingly difficult, resulting in a deficit of over 2,600 yuan. If we count on collecting over 2,000 yuan in membership fees by the spring to offset the deficit, the actual loss is no more than 600 yuan. The collection of membership fees has been difficult, with many owing for the autumn and winter seasons. Without funds, how can the association survive? The temporary general meeting of members decided to organize an economic committee, dividing it into eight districts, to be responsible for urging payment. Committee members for each district were appointed by the members of each district present, and recorded. Furthermore, the economic committee decided that the association will print and distribute the pledge forms, along with the list of member representatives of the tobacco and alcohol associations in each district, the original amount of membership fees, and the overdue fee slips, separately. All are to be returned to the association within 20 days, so as to have a comprehensive plan. If there is still no solution by the deadline, the joint association will be dissolved. It is noted that the tobacco and alcohol industries exist everywhere. If they are like a plate of loose sand, since the founding of the Republic, donations and taxes have been repeatedly increased, with no end in sight. Being taken from and demanded from, being at the mercy of others, is all due to the lack of a united resistance. Last year, the associations of Shanghai City worked hard to rise up, loudly calling for action, which led to the organization of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Joint Association. At the inaugural meeting, more than a hundred associations participated, a passionate display that greatly enhanced the reputation of tobacco and alcohol merchants. How long ago was it that it has now fallen into a difficult state due to financial problems? Those who do not know the details will certainly say it is a 'five-minute fever'. In fact, it is not entirely so. In my opinion, there are other reasons. At the beginning of the association's establishment, the members had greater hopes. At that time, the tax regulations were being changed. The association worked for several months, but the goal was not achieved, which must have dissatisfied the majority of members. In fact, the change of regulations at that time was due to the arbitrary and self-willed actions of the former tax commissioner, Xie Qi, who announced and implemented the regulations with lightning speed during the annual handover, making it fundamentally difficult to overturn. However, the association repeatedly sent representatives to various places to petition, running around and appealing, and ultimately managed to force changes in the harsh regulations. The work was not without effort. If there had been no joint association to take the lead, the suffering of tobacco and alcohol merchants everywhere from the harsh treatment of tax collectors would have been unimaginable. In human affairs, there are tangible benefits and intangible benefits. Since its establishment, the association, even if it has achieved little, can be considered blameless. We agreed in the beginning and should be determined. We must not sit back and watch it dissolve because its effects are not significant. Think about it, if the joint association were to disappear, outsiders would laugh at our inability to unite, and we would be at the mercy of others, which is to be expected. Moreover, there are only three months left until the end of the year. Due to the changes in the regulations this year, merchants have suffered greatly, and tax revenues have actually fallen short. The competent authorities should also be aware that reform is not a good plan. Knowledgeable people expect that the policy will still be changed next year. Therefore, requesting improvements to the tax regulations and seeking various benefits for the industry is of great importance to the association. Nothing can be done without money. If the association's finances are unsustainable, how can it be supported? The decision to print and distribute pledge forms, asking each association to fill them out, is a kind of test to see whether each member has the sincerity to support the joint association. In other words, if they all give up, the joint association will also disappear and will no longer be maintained. The matter concerns the interests of the industry in the three provinces and cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou. I dare not remain silent. I sincerely state this directly, and I am confident that you will agree in the beginning and will certainly maintain it in the end. I hope that you will communicate my humble opinion to each member of your district, and promptly fill out the pledge forms and send them to the association. The amount owed for the autumn and winter seasons, along with the spring and summer membership fees that should be paid, is not much, and I believe it will not be difficult to arrange. I urge you to supervise and send them to the association by the deadline to provide assistance. The matter concerns public welfare, so please do not disregard or put it aside. This is my earnest prayer."</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Over-Year-Long "Butterfly" Trademark Case Concludes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Hu Die's Portrait Trademark Approved for Registration</p>
<p>The case between the Huanan Chemical Industry Company and the Family Industry Company over the "Butterfly" trademark dispute has been ongoing for over a year, with both parties repeatedly litigating. Previously, the Huanan Chemical Industry Company specially hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao to file an administrative appeal with the Executive Yuan according to law. The Executive Yuan has now decided that Ms. Hu Die's portrait trademark should be approved for registration according to law. The full text of the original decision is transcribed as follows: Executive Yuan Decision Document, Su Zi No. 8, [Main Text] The original disposition and the original decision are both revoked. The re-appellant's ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] trademark is approved for registration according to law. [Facts] The re-appellant previously applied for registration of four ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] trademarks, respectively used for tooth powder and toothpaste, which were approved and listed under numbers 12924, 12925, 12926, and 12927. Subsequently, the Family Industry Company claimed that the four trademarks imitated its registered numbers 210 ["Meili"], 3586 ["Circular Half-Body Woman"], 10717 ["Invincible Brand Chinese and Western"], and four applications for registration of ["Butterfly Chinese and Western"], 209 ["Invincible Brand"], and approved number 13173 ["Butterfly Chinese and Western"] trademarks for similar products, and filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau. The bureau, believing that the characters ["Hu Die"] in the re-appellant's trademark were likely to be confused in pronunciation with the characters ["Invincible"] of the Family Industry Company's Invincible Brand, revoked the registration of the re-appellant's trademark. The re-appellant requested a review of the objection, but it was rejected. Dissatisfied with this disposition, they appealed to the Ministry of Industry. The ministry, referring to various relevant documents from the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the former Trademark Bureau, which stated that ["Invincible Brand is Butterfly Brand"] and ["Invincible Brand is commonly known as Butterfly Brand"], held that the two characters ["Hu Die"] and ["Butterfly"] were completely indistinguishable, and confusion was unavoidable in transactions, so the appeal was rejected. The re-appellant was still not satisfied and filed a further appeal with the Executive Yuan. [Reasoning] In this case, the characters, graphics, symbols, and colors used in the ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] trademark in dispute by the re-appellant are not identical to the various trademarks of the Family Industry Company's Invincible Brand. What should be examined is whether the homophony between ["Hu Die Brand"] and ["Invincible Brand"] can be a reason for not allowing registration, and whether ["Invincible Brand is Butterfly Brand"] can exclude the registration of the ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] trademark. The pronunciation of the two characters ["Invincible"] and ["Hu Die"] is not without similarity, but the characters in trademark law only refer to the form they represent, and do not include the pronunciation, as explained in interpretations 1003 and 1044 of the Judicial Yuan. If the re-appellant's trademark in dispute is not allowed to be registered because the two characters ["Hu Die"] and ["Invincible"] are homophones, it would be inconsistent with the interpretations of the Judicial Yuan. Furthermore, the re-appellant previously applied for registration using the two characters ["Hu Die"], which was revoked by the Trademark Bureau. They then modified the two characters ["Hu Die"] to the six characters ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] to apply for registration as the trademark name. Thus, ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] has become a complete trademark name, which can be distinguished from the Family Industry Company's ["Invincible Brand, commonly known as Butterfly Brand"] in writing, and it is naturally difficult to not allow its registration according to law. The Trademark Bureau's rejection of the re-appellant's trademark registration, and the Ministry of Industry's rejection of its appeal, are improper. However, when the re-appellant actually uses the trademark, only the two characters ["Hu Die"] are written, which should be corrected. Subsequently, the re-appellant should indicate the six characters ["Ms. Hu Die Portrait"] on the trademark to comply with the original case. Based on the above conclusions, the appeal is justified, and the decision is made in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 9 of the Appeal Law as stated in the main text.</p>

<p>The Wu Ben Farm on the Shanghai-Qingpu Road, near the Hongqiao Road, was founded by Central Committee member Wang Zhengting. Planting of the first district began at the end of last year and was completed at the beginning of this month. Now that the Shanghai-Qingpu Road base has been completed and the road is about to open to traffic, there will be a great need for roadside trees. Therefore, more workers were hired the day before yesterday to plant dozens of acres of superior seedlings such as French plane trees and poplars for the second district, which was completed yesterday, and the establishment has been reported accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Cracking Down on Extra Demands by Porters on Both Railways <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>A Flat Rate of Twelve Copper Coins Per Piece</p>
<p>The Two Railways Transportation Department, noting that porters at various stations, despite repeated strict prohibitions against extra demands, continue to engage in such behavior, which harms the railway's reputation, has organized a committee to crack down on extra demands by porters, and has studied effective methods of crackdown, resulting in the following three resolutions: (1) Regarding the re-determination of porterage fees, it was resolved: (a) The porterage fee for luggage, regardless of distance or weight, shall be a flat rate of twelve copper coins per piece. (b) This porterage fee refers to the service of carrying luggage from outside the station gate to the baggage room, and then from the baggage room to the train, or from the train to the baggage room, and then from the baggage room to outside the station gate. (c) The porterage fee for packages shall be eight copper coins per piece for packages weighing 60 kilograms or less, and twelve copper coins per piece for packages weighing more than 60 kilograms up to 120 kilograms. (2) Regarding how to crack down on porters rushing onto trains or competing to carry luggage, it was resolved that the personnel in charge at each station must evenly distribute the daily porterage fees collected, so that porters have equal treatment. (3) Regarding cracking down on porters extorting passengers, it was resolved: (a) Prepare a price list for baggage delivery, clearly stating "Baggage delivery: twelve copper coins per piece," and "If there are extra demands, please bring this card to the stationmaster." The card should also indicate the porter's number, and be issued to each porter for use. When carrying luggage, whether entering or leaving the station, the porter must hand the card to the passenger, who will pay the porter according to the price list after all procedures are completed, and return the card to the porter. If there are extra demands, the passenger can bring the card to the stationmaster. If a porter fails to hand the card to the passenger when carrying luggage, they should be severely punished immediately. (b) Advertise as much as possible to the public, so that passengers know to ask the porter for the card when hiring a porter to carry luggage. (c) If a porter extorts a passenger, they should be immediately dismissed, and a photo taken and posted at major stations, never to be employed again. (d) The porter's uniform should state "Baggage delivery: twelve copper coins per piece." (e) The stationmaster's office should have a photo of each porter, with their name and number noted. Every morning and afternoon, the person in charge should report the number and number of porters on duty to the stationmaster. If it is found that the number does not match, they should be dismissed immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Xu Case Committee Members Accused of Insulting the Court's Judgment <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxing Absent, Rescheduled for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Wang Honghui and Others Fined 200 Yuan Each</p>
<p>The five committee members of the Xu Case Support Association who were accused were tried yesterday afternoon in the eighth courtroom of the First Special District Local Court by Judge Zhan Liangce. Beforehand, to maintain order and prevent irrelevant people from entering the courtroom, the court authorities specially dispatched several Chinese and Western detectives from the Municipal Council Police to assist. Court judicial police were stationed at the court gate and inside and outside the eighth courtroom, strictly enforcing order. Those not related to the case were not issued visitor passes. At 2:50 PM, Judge Zhan, Prosecutor Zhong Qing, and the court clerk took their seats. Except for Ye Jiaxing, the four defendants, Wang Honghui, Huang Hanliang, Xue Guangqian, and Li Ruzhang, entered the courtroom with their defense lawyers. The visitor seats were unusually empty, so the courtroom was extremely quiet. First, Judge Zhan asked the four defendants their names, ages, residences, and occupations. Then, Prosecutor Zhong Qing stood up and stated that the indictment in this case was detailed in the indictment, and they should be questioned according to law. Then, the lawyer representing the defendant Ye Jiaxing stated that Ye Jiaxing had gone to Beijing because he worked at the headquarters of the 26th Division. Ye was commissioned on September 6, 1933. This time, he received a telegram from the division headquarters and immediately went to Beijing, and submitted the commission to the court. Judge Zhan, since Ye had not surrendered, immediately began questioning the other four defendants. First, Wang Honghui was brought to the stand. He was informed that the prosecutor had charged him with publicly insulting a public office in accordance with Article 146, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and that he should have received the indictment. He was asked if he had any defense to offer today. Wang Honghui replied that the Xu Case Committee members were nominated by others, not something he wanted to do. On January 16, after the rent reduction meeting ended, he left the meeting. He was not present at the subsequent Xu Case meeting. He claimed not to know about anything. The court then asked when the Xu Case Committee was established, who the committee members were, what work they did, and who drafted the declaration for the first executive committee meeting on January 20, which nominated him as secretary. Wang generally replied that he did not know or did not pay attention. Next, Huang Hanliang was called, and he was also informed of the legal articles he was accused of violating. Huang Hanliang then argued that he was originally a member of the presidium at the January 16 rent reduction meeting. By the time the discussion was over, he was already mentally exhausted, so he left the meeting. He did not participate in the subsequent expulsion meeting. Although the *Min Bao* newspaper reported that he was nominated as a committee member, he did not read the *Min Bao* and did not know about it at the time. Only after being summoned for investigation did he find out. He had already published a statement in the newspaper on March 19 after the investigation. What he wants to say is all in the newspaper. Then, he presented a newspaper. The court subsequently asked about the petition to the Ministry of Justice in Beijing, but he flatly denied it, claiming that he went to Beijing by night train on February 20, falsely claiming it was a rent reduction issue. Then, Xue Guangqian was called for questioning. Xue stated that he had two points to defend regarding the accusation: (1) Regarding the Xu Case Committee part, he left the rent reduction meeting that day. He was arrested as a Xu Case Committee member, which he was informed of the next day by a friend named Zhang. However, he had already sent a letter of resignation on the 18th and had never participated. (2) Regarding the petition to Beijing part, he stated that on the date he was accused of going to Beijing, he was actually working at the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to the Social Affairs Bureau providing proof for him, he had submitted to the Ministry of Justice his identification and attached his photo requesting recognition of his appearance. It was possible that someone was using his name. Finally, Li Ruzhang was questioned. Li confessed that although he was nominated as a committee member, he did not take office and could not be held responsible. He also claimed that he was sick at home on February 21 and never went to Beijing. After Judge Zhan finished questioning, believing that the case was clear, he ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Zhong then stood up to argue, stating that Ye Jiaxing's part would be handled after he arrives. The remaining four defendants, based on the results of the investigation, were clearly important members of the Xu Case Committee and should be responsible for the declaration. He requested that they be punished according to law. The lawyers of each defendant also debated in turn. The court then announced the verdict: except for Ye Jiaxing, whose questioning was rescheduled, the remaining four defendants were jointly found guilty of publicly insulting a public office and were each fined 200 yuan. If they chose to convert the fine into imprisonment, each three yuan would offset one day of imprisonment.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Lixin Accounting Firm Seeks Opinions on Accounting Terminology <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>And Presents a Newly Published Translation of Accounting Terms</p>
<p>The staff of the Lixin Accounting Firm in Shanghai are dedicated to the study of accounting theory. They believe that the current state of accounting terms in China is confusing and complex, and has not yet been standardized, causing inconvenience in both academic and business circles. Therefore, the firm's accountants, editorial staff, and school staff jointly formed an accounting terminology discussion group to research accounting terms. After a year of work, they compiled a "Translation of Accounting Terms," which contains over 2,200 English accounting terms and their research findings. The book lists all existing accounting terms from various published Chinese accounting books, as well as terms created and proposed by the firm itself, for comparison. The book has now been published, and the firm is distributing it to public and private institutions or individuals interested in studying accounting. At the same time, it is soliciting opinions from the national accounting academic and business communities on these translations. The announcement by Pan Xulun, the head accountant of the firm, is transcribed below.</p>
<p>We believe that accounting theory in China is still in its infancy, and accounting terms have not yet been standardized. When reading existing accounting books, the terminology used is often inconsistent, causing inconvenience not only for accounting professionals in practice, but also making it difficult for accounting scholars to choose appropriate terms in their writing. This is a matter that urgently needs improvement in China's accounting field.</p>
<p>Our firm's staff have been serving in the accounting profession for ten years and have always been dedicated to promoting accounting theory and improving accounting practice in China. Currently, while compiling the "Lixin Accounting Series" and the "Lixin Accounting Quarterly," we deeply feel the need to standardize accounting terms. Therefore, we have collected various translations from existing Chinese accounting books, and added to and compiled them, which was then reviewed and studied by the Lixin Accounting Terminology Discussion Group organized by our firm's staff, resulting in the "Translation of Accounting Terms" in two volumes. The book contains approximately 2,200 terms. In addition to listing the existing translations from various sources in China for comparison, the terms selected, proposed, or tentatively proposed by our firm's staff are also included.</p>
<p>However, we are aware that our staff's knowledge is limited and our understanding is incomplete. Furthermore, this work is of great importance to accounting theory and business in China, and it would be difficult to achieve perfection without soliciting broad opinions and gradually making corrections. Therefore, we are soliciting opinions from accounting experts across the country on these accounting terms, and we sincerely hope for your guidance.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our firm has printed an additional 1,000 copies of this book and will distribute them to all sectors for initial consideration. If any individuals or groups in China who are interested in studying accounting terms wish to request the book from our firm, please provide your name, address, and occupation, and we will send you two copies. One copy should be kept for your records, and we hope that you will mark the other copy with your suggestions for correction and return it to us as soon as possible, so that we can gather opinions, revise the original proposed translations, and publish them again, so that the confusing and complex accounting term translations in China can be gradually standardized. This is not only what our firm's staff hope for, but also what the entire accounting community in China would be fortunate to have. This is an announcement.</p>

<p>And Prepares to Establish a Night School</p>
<p>The China Correspondence School of Accountancy, located at 275 Gordon Road in Shanghai, has been established for many years and has achieved remarkable results. After moving to its new location on Xin Zha Road, it has been actively expanding its school affairs. Recently, in response to widespread requests from all sectors of society, the school decided to add face-to-face teaching. To meet the needs of society, the school, through a meeting of school affairs, decided to first hold accounting Q&amp;A classes. Anyone in the accounting field who encounters doubts in their studies or practice that they cannot understand clearly can come to the school to ask questions. The principal of the school, accountant Shen Liren, will personally explain. The teaching time is based on one-hour units, and the tuition fee is five yuan per unit. Those who wish to be taught can first make an appointment by telephone and then receive instruction on time. This kind of teaching method is extremely economical in terms of time for students, and the guidance of a good teacher yields many benefits. It is truly a rare opportunity for those who aspire to study this field. It is said that students of the school's correspondence courses will not be charged extra for attending the Q&amp;A sessions. In addition, the school is preparing to establish a night school, which must follow the school term. Since the school term is currently in progress, it is not convenient to start halfway. It is said that the school is currently preparing everything and plans to start offering the night school from the next semester. The full course is scheduled for three years, which shows the completeness of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Banks and National Goods Companies</p>
<p>Organize One Hundred Sales Teams</p>
<p>Recently, due to the increasingly bleak world economic situation, the number of unemployed people has been increasing. Although the reasons are not limited to one, one of the main reasons is that merchants do not go deep into the people. Recently, the Ningbo Industrial Bank and the Shanghai National Goods Company in this city, in view of this, have organized one hundred sales teams, divided into ten groups. Its nature is entirely to help unemployed small businessmen. The Ningbo Industrial Bank provides funds and lends money to small businessmen using economic credit methods, while the Shanghai National Goods Company is responsible for importing goods from various national goods manufacturers at cost and selling them to the sales teams, who then take them to the countryside to sell. The first step is to investigate the demand for domestic goods in the villages near Shanghai. The Shanghai National Goods Company will then purchase the goods on their behalf. The sales teams can profit, and the goods can penetrate the people. This is a business that is beneficial without harm, achieving multiple goals in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Dagongshe reports that 19 cleaning workers in the Caojiadu area of West Shanghai were arrested and sent to the bureau for questioning the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, at around 6 a.m., two more night soil collectors, Wang Aisheng and Little Monk, were pushing a night soil cart when they were spotted by a patrol officer on Jessfield Road in West Shanghai. The officer suspected that the workers were also involved in the disturbance, so he arrested them and sent them to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau for interrogation, after which they were returned to custody. Upon hearing the news, all the workers, because the Public Security Bureau had repeatedly arrested people, making it difficult to work with peace of mind, unanimously suspended work and requested assistance from Party and government agencies. The West Shanghai Cleaning Department, because the original night soil carters stopped working, which was a matter of public health, dismissed all the original workers and recruited new workers to replace them. The workers felt that the Cleaning Department disregarded their suffering and was illegally oppressing them, so they immediately convened a meeting and decided to: (1) petition the Party headquarters; (2) demand the restoration of their original jobs; (3) quickly release the arrested workers; (4) guarantee that the same incidents will not occur in the future; (5) if necessary, go to the Municipal Government to petition.</p>

<p>The Huining Fellow Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Construction Department yesterday, requesting that the local垫款 for the Shexiu Road be approved and reimbursed to demonstrate fairness, since the provincial government has taken back the road for improvement. The original telegram stated: "To Director Liu of the Anhui Construction Department: According to a telegram from the She County government, 'In the case of the Construction Department reclaiming the Xiu She Road for improvement, Jin, a technician, and Engineer Wang were sent to jointly estimate the cost and the county was instructed to assist in the process and negotiate the handover. We are reporting accordingly and requesting your verification. We have telegraphed you to transfer the handover and report accordingly.' Upon receiving this, a meeting of various agencies and groups in the city and previous staff was convened on February 20th at the county government to discuss. In addition to telegraphing the results of the discussion to the Construction Department for instructions and ordering the Highway Office to transfer the handover in compliance with the order, the She section of the highway was originally built with local funds, totaling over 110,000 yuan, including a large amount of垫款 that had been approved. Now that we have been ordered to reclaim the road, we will hold another meeting to discuss how the Construction Department will evaluate the cost and how to reimburse the垫款 to facilitate the handling. We have also sent separate telegrams to the She County Fellow Association in Shanghai, and we are reporting accordingly and requesting your verification. We hope you will uphold justice and assist in the request so that it can be concluded as soon as possible, which would be fortunate for the local area.' The She County Chamber of Commerce, Finance Committee, district offices, groups, and gentry Cao Tingsheng and Ye Deqin have also sent telegrams stating the same reasons as above. Therefore, we are sending a telegram to your office requesting verification. We hope that both parties will take into consideration the road base, road surface, bridge culverts, machinery, station buildings, and the local垫款 that has been approved, and approve the reimbursement. We also hope that the conversion of earthwork will be handled fairly to demonstrate justice and satisfy the people's hopes. We would be very grateful. The Huining Fellow Association respectfully reports."</p>

<p>All Goods Sold at Discounted Prices</p>
<p>The Nanshi National Goods Market of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has opened a children's area on the third floor for two weeks to commemorate Children's Day. Various children's products, children's paintings, and student achievements are displayed in a beautiful arrangement. Students from various schools have been invited to visit the market to arouse children's interest in using national goods.

<h3 id="e172">Gengzi Indemnity Funds and Educational and Cultural Undertakings in Various Countries (4) <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<h3 id="e173">Belgian Gengzi Indemnity <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>1. Motivation for Returning the Funds</p>
<p>The Belgian Gengzi indemnity refund movement is actually a branch of the Sino-French education movement. In the second year of the Republic, Li Yuzhi and the French Doctor Delamare founded the Society for Thrifty Study in France to introduce students to study in France. Some of them were transferred to study in Belgium. Later, Cai Yuanpei, Wang Zhaoming, Li Yuying, and the French men Eurard, Moudai, and Delamare founded the Sino-French Education Association to introduce more and more students to study in Belgium, especially at the Ecole Ouvriere Superieure (Xiaoluohai Workers' University). The idea of refunding the funds to promote education became increasingly prominent.</p>
<p>2. The Mature Period for Returning the Funds</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic, the national education community launched a campaign to request various countries to return the funds. At that time, Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University, and others initiated the campaign in the north, sending commissioners to Europe to negotiate, paying particular attention to Belgium. The southwest also entrusted Wang Zhaoming, Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, and others to go to Europe to investigate education, focusing on the refund of funds from France and Belgium. After the eighth year of the Republic, Chu Minyi, the correspondent of Peking University in Europe, continued the efforts. It happened that Professor Surlet of the University of Brussels advocated the idea of returning the funds to promote education, and Jellot, the president of the Xiaoluohai University, also advocated jointly establishing a Sino-Belgian University with China and requested the Belgian government to subsidize the funds and hoped for the return of the funds. In the ninth year of the Republic, Chu Minyi and Xiao Yu negotiated with Jellot again, surveyed the site near the Labour University of Xiaoluohai, and established a Chinese student dormitory to establish the foundation for the Sino-Belgian University. Soon, Mr. Xiao returned to China and reported this to the authorities of Peking University and the Sino-French University Office in Beijing, both of which received enthusiastic support. In the winter of that year, the Guangdong Provincial Government donated 120,000 francs and remitted them to be used for the opening and equipment of the Sino-Belgian University. In the tenth year of the Republic, the educational associations of Hunan and Zhili provinces initiated a joint petition of the national academic community to friendly countries to return the funds for education, with 43,000 people signing the petition. In the winter of the eleventh year, Xiao Yu was sent to Belgium again as a representative to submit the petition. Wang Jingqi, the Chinese ambassador to Belgium, also assisted in the promotion. Before long, Lefu, the Belgian Minister of Education, Chaspar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Frank, the Minister of Colonies, Destere, a member of the Parliament, and Franki, a minister of state and president of the National Bank, successively supported the proposal, and the refund of the funds was successful.</p>
<p>3. Exchange of Notes between China and Belgium</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Republic, the Beijing government and the Belgian ambassador to China consulted several times. On September 5 of that year, the governments of China and Belgium established an exchange of notes to resolve the Belgian part of the Gengzi indemnity. The content was roughly as follows: the Chinese government acknowledged that the balance of the Belgian part of the Gengzi indemnity, amounting to 29,053,611 francs and 15 centimes, from September 1, 1925 to the end of December 1940, would be calculated according to the telegraphic transfer method adopted in 1905. The Sino-Belgian Bank would advance the funds and pay them to the Belgian government in one lump sum. The Chinese government should order the Inspector General of Customs to first repay the Sino-Belgian Bank's advance funds on a monthly basis from the customs revenue starting from September 1, 1925. After the advance funds were repaid, the funds paid monthly by the Inspector General of Customs would be handed over to the Sino-Belgian Committee for Sino-Belgian educational, charitable, public and public works projects. According to this agreement, all funds delivered by the Inspector General of Customs to the Sino-Belgian Bank should be issued as a US dollar bond with a total amount of US$5,605,991.42 (This is the pure principal of the Chinese government's debt to Belgium). The total amount of principal and interest listed on the individual bonds would be US$9,044,402.68 (This is the pure principal of the Chinese government's debt to Belgium plus the estimated interest). The advance funds that should be repaid to the Sino-Belgian Bank had already been repaid in full by May 1927. The remaining Gengzi indemnity due in that month was US$23,541.56.</p>
<p>4. Second Sino-Belgian Agreement</p>
<p>According to the original agreement (i.e., the first agreement), the funds remaining after the repayment of the advance funds should be handed over to the Sino-Belgian Committee for safekeeping and allocation. The Chinese and Belgian governments specially consulted on the matter in December 1927. As a result, the remaining funds from May 1927, together with the indemnity for ten months from June 1927 to March 1928, were allowed to be used by the Chinese government to withdraw from customs. Of this amount, US$100,000 should be set aside for repatriation and relief of Belgian nationals. All customs revenue received monthly from April 1, 1928, to December 31, 1940, would be used as security for the issuance of US dollar bonds. The funds would be allocated as follows: 40% to the Longhai Railway for the purchase of materials from Belgium, 35% to other Chinese state-owned railways for the purchase of materials from Belgium, and 25% for Sino-Belgian educational and charitable undertakings.

<h3 id="e174">British Boxer Indemnity Funds <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>1.  Motivation for Refund</p>
<p>The idea of ​​refunding the British Boxer Indemnity Funds came later, around after the Great War. At that time, the British government (1) recognized the remarkable achievements of the United States in managing education with refunded funds, (2) was influenced by the Allies allowing China to suspend payment of indemnity funds for five years during the Great War, and (3) was moved by the enthusiasm of both the government and the public in China for refunding the indemnity funds. Therefore, it intended to return the Boxer Indemnity Funds to China for the benefit of both countries. Around 1918, Wang Xueting, Liang Long, Ren Kainan, Chen Yuan and other students studying in the UK published a booklet requesting the UK to refund the indemnity funds, and contacted the British government, parliament, and education circles. Many parties expressed sympathy. At the same time, the domestic education circles launched a "Same Standard" movement, and entrusted Tao Menghe and others, who were going to Europe to study post-war education, to lobby the British. Since then, British figures such as Russell, Lewis, and Giles have written articles in British newspapers and magazines advocating the refund, which attracted public attention.</p>
<p>2.  Maturity Period of Refund</p>
<p>In 1922, students studying in the UK organized the Boxer Indemnity Funds for Education Committee, with Yang Ziyu as chairman, Chen Baorong as secretary, and Zhang Daofan, Deng Yousheng, Huang Jianzhong, Liu Zhaoming, Pan Shaotang and others as members, to jointly carry out activities at home and abroad. Initially, they only wrote articles, gave speeches, and published booklets to promote the refund to members of the British Parliament, education circles, and the press. Later, they invited Cai Yuanpei, a famous Chinese educator in Europe, to go to the UK to advocate for the refund. After Cai arrived in London, with the assistance of Zhu Zhaoxin, the acting Chinese representative in the UK, and all the students studying in the UK, he made strong contacts with the British government and the public. He also gave a speech on [The Development of Chinese Education] at the China Society, hosted by the British, emphasizing that the new China would soon rise and desperately needed scientific education, hoping that the British would provide moral and economic assistance (referring to the refund of the indemnity funds for education). He also submitted a written opinion to the British Parliament, clearly stating that the refund should be used for education as a permanent memorial. Subsequently, Cai made the same appeal in the Liverpool area, which was greatly appreciated by British government officials and the public. In the winter of 1922, the British government formally declared that the remaining Boxer Indemnity Funds due to be paid by China would be returned to China for education, culture, and mutually beneficial projects between the two countries. However, due to the British parliamentary elections and frequent cabinet changes, the matter was put on hold until June 1925, when the British Parliament formally passed the [Chinese Indemnity Funds Bill], which completely confirmed the matter. Subsequently, considering the need for prior research on the use of the funds, an advisory committee was established, with eleven members, eight from the UK and three from China. In 1926, the committee organized a delegation consisting of Lord Willingdon, Dame Anne Anderson, Professor Soothill, Ding Wenjiang, Hu Shi, and Zeng Chun, to investigate and collect opinions on the use of the refunded funds in various parts of China. At the end of the same year, the delegation prepared a report and recommendations, the content of which was very important. Later, the exchange of notes between the two countries was based on this.</p>
<p>3.  Central Government's Exchange of Notes</p>
<p>In September 1930, China and the UK formally signed an exchange of notes, returning the British Boxer Indemnity Funds due to be paid from December 1, 1922, to the Chinese government for management. The Chinese government agreed to use all of these funds as a foundation for educational and cultural undertakings, in accordance with the opinions of the delegation of the advisory committee. Later, the plan was slightly changed, and a portion of the existing and future Boxer Indemnity Funds was borrowed to reorganize and build Chinese railways and other productive enterprises, using the interest to fund educational and cultural undertakings. The recommendation of the advisory committee was adopted to organize a board of directors to manage and allocate the entire Boxer Indemnity Funds. The Chinese government also transferred all existing funds to the London Purchasing Committee, established in London, to purchase bridges, locomotives, vehicles, steel rails, and other materials from British factories for use in Chinese state-owned railways and other productive enterprises. It was stipulated that the refunded funds accumulated from December 1, 1922, to April 1931, totaled £3,504,122 7s 7d, and would be kept by the London Purchasing Committee for the British Boxer Indemnity Funds, which was affiliated to the board of directors. The British Minister to China would hand over half of the Boxer Indemnity Funds that gradually came due to the committee and half to the London Purchasing Committee.</p>
<p>4.  Total Amount of British Boxer Indemnity Funds Refunded and Principles for Borrowing and Allocation</p>
<p>The total amount of British Boxer Indemnity Funds to be refunded was £11,186,547 12s, including interest. The amount of Boxer Indemnity Funds due each year varied. This year it was about £596,481. The principles for borrowing and allocation have been stipulated by the Central Political Council, with two-thirds borrowed for the construction and reorganization of railways, and one-third borrowed for water conservancy, electrical and other construction projects (this one-third is divided into 40% for the Huai River Commission, 20% for the Guangdong River Management Committee, and the remaining 40% for (1) developing electrical industries, (2) managing the Yellow River water conservancy, and (3) developing basic industries, each receiving one-third). The annual interest rate for the loans is 5%.</p>
<p>5.  Amount of Funds Allocated to Educational and Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>The British Boxer Indemnity Funds have not been refunded for long, and not many funds have been loaned to various agencies. The interest earned is not enough to be used for educational and cultural undertakings. However, two principles have been established for the use and allocation of interest: (1) It should be used for educational and cultural buildings with permanent commemorative significance and important national cultural undertakings, and should not be used to subsidize the regular or temporary expenses of any agency. (2) Proper allocation should be given to both the central government and various cultural centers across the country, so as to concentrate resources, popularize results, and supplement the shortcomings of domestic education and culture.</p>
<p>6.  Board of Directors Organization</p>
<p>The British Boxer Indemnity Funds Committee is officially named the Board of Trustees for the Administration of the Returned Boxer Indemnity Funds. The board has fifteen directors, two-thirds from China and one-third from the UK, appointed by the National Government of the Republic of China and subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Their term of office is three years, with the first term being five people each for one, two, and three years, determined by drawing lots. There is one chairman, appointed by the Chinese government, and one vice-chairman, elected by the directors. Their duties are to manage and allocate the British Boxer Indemnity Funds. Board meetings require the attendance of more than half of the directors, and resolutions must be approved by more than half of the directors present to be valid.</p>
<p>7.  Current Board Members</p>
<p>The Chinese members are Zhu Jiahua, Li Shuhua, Li Siguang, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Ruiheng, Song Ziliang, Chen Qicai, Zeng Rongpu, Zeng Yangfu, and Yan Deqing. The British members are Hughes, Massy, ​​Corder, Turner, and Brown. Zhu Jiahua is also the chairman, and Massy is also the vice-chairman.</p>
<p>8.  Recent Distribution of British Boxer Indemnity Funds</p>
<p>Recently, not much of the British Boxer Indemnity Funds has been loaned to domestic railways, water conservancy, electrical and other construction projects. As of the end of last year, the interest received was only more than 500,000 yuan in national currency, so it has not yet begun to be distributed. According to the recent budget submitted by the Board of Trustees for the Administration of the Returned Boxer Indemnity Funds, only the expenses for sending students to study in the UK are included, totaling 229,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, there are only the daily expenses of the committee, and the rest has not been used.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Inspect Shanxi Education Report <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Education Funds Not Yet Independent</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently sent personnel to inspect education in Shanxi Province. The results of the inspection have been submitted to the Ministry of Education. The following is a detailed account of the opinions on the improvements to be made in Shanxi education in the report:</p>
<p>| Regarding Higher Education |</p>
<p>(1) The amount of higher education funding should be separated from the funding for the attached middle school when compiling the budget from the 23rd academic year onwards. The departments and specialties established should also implement the price calculation plan. If the staffing exceeds the budget, efforts should be made to terminate it. (2) The College of Engineering of Shanxi University must increase equipment as the first step in rectification. The provincial government should allocate temporary funding of 100,000 yuan starting in the 23rd academic year, which can be paid in two installments. The list of equipment to be increased should be compiled by the president of the university with a plan and a list of the number of items and price list submitted to the Ministry for record. (3) The merger of the Provincial Law School and the College of Education into Shanxi University should be handled quickly in accordance with the order and submitted to the Ministry for verification. (4) Technical colleges should concentrate their efforts to expand practice grounds. Subsequently, the establishment of specialties must obtain academic liaison with the part of the attached middle school that is being transformed into vocational schools in order to complete its industrial manufacturing system. (5) Commercial colleges should change the way students practice, paying attention to commercial surveys, commodity research, transportation methods, tax regulations, market conditions, etc., to prepare for future employment.</p>
<p>| Regarding General Education |</p>
<p>(1) It is found that the province's vocational education funding only accounts for 3% of the secondary education funding, which is far from the standard set by the Ministry. In addition to the order to gradually close down the National Normal School and to convert the attached middle schools of the technical and commercial colleges into vocational schools and to stop recruiting students for the attached middle schools of agricultural colleges, so as to transfer the savings to vocational education funding, the report submitted by Gu Zhaohua, the Ministry's inspector, provides a table of the annual distribution and amount of secondary education funding in Shanxi Province. It is estimated that the standard set by the Ministry can be reached in the 26th academic year. The department should carefully review this and use it as a basis. If there are any matters that are not fully covered, the department should recompile it in the same format and submit it to the Ministry for verification. (2) The province's education funding has not yet been independent, and there is no designated special fund for education. The department should invite the presidents of provincial schools and colleges to jointly investigate and study the independent education funding plan, first seeking to determine the special fund and then submit it to the provincial government for implementation. (3) The province's promotion of the laws and regulations issued by the Ministry is still diligent, but there are still areas that need to be earnestly implemented. They should be implemented in accordance with the following points: 1. The names of provincial middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools should be based on the location in accordance with the regulations. Except for the three locations of Taiyuan Girls' Junior High School, Changzhi Girls' Junior High School, and Yuncheng Girls' Junior High School, which have already been changed, the National Normal School will temporarily retain its original name. The other schools should be corrected separately as listed in the attached table. 2. All existing co-educational junior high schools should be changed to joint schools, retaining the original names of Yangxing, Hefen, Huze, Jiangyuan Puban, etc., in order to comply with the regulations and avoid frequent changes. 3. Private senior high schools in the provincial capital charge students fees without any standards. The Department of Education should consider the situation and re-regulate them to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum limit stipulated by the Ministry, so as to correct them. 4. Local primary schools generally lack contact, and most do not have organizations for primary school research associations. Efforts should be made to supervise and promote them, starting with areas with developed education. 5. There are many omissions in the statistics of various middle schools and normal schools, and many tables and books are also lacking and incomplete. Orders should be issued to prepare them for application. 6. The naming of primary schools in various counties has not yet been changed. The Department of Education should instruct its subordinates to quickly correct them in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Primary School Regulations in order to achieve uniformity. (4) The establishment and management of joint and county junior high schools in the province should be handled in accordance with the following points: 1. The standard for the establishment of junior high schools should be determined by the number of students that senior high schools, normal schools, and vocational schools can accommodate, and should not exceed one-third of the number of students that can be accommodated at most. 2. The surplus classes in junior high schools should be gradually reduced, and the savings should be used to convert them into vocational or other types of schools | or to designate a certain junior high school to be completely converted, or to concentrate the savings to establish new schools, which will be presided over by the Department of Education. 3. The savings in the previous item can be transferred to equipment costs, but they must be approved by the Department of Education. 4. The Department of Education should consider the circumstances and formulate a rectification plan for each junior high school. (5) The province's Taiyuan City has made great achievements in promoting compulsory education. The implementation method of the short-term system is very appropriate. In the future, attention should be paid to the promotion of experimental districts in various counties. (6) The private senior high schools in the province are concentrated in the provincial capital, and the management situation is very inconsistent. They should be earnestly reorganized in accordance with the opinions of the Ministry's inspectors. (7) In the future, the development of vocational education in Shanxi should correspond to the province's construction plan. The points that should be noted should be handled with reference to the inspection opinions.</p>

<p>Before the 18th year of the Republic, the income and expenditure of education funds in various counties in Jiangsu Province were generally without a budget, resulting in insufficient actual income. Counties such as Jiangdu, Gaoyou, and Baoying often accumulated debts due to the lack of standards for expenditure. After the establishment of the Department of Education, the compilation of education budget was considered very important, as this was the only way to prevent waste and urged it very strictly. If the income of education funds in various counties does not change, it can gradually reach a stable state. The new education budget for the 23rd year of the Republic was originally limited to the end of March for compilation and submission for approval. The county education bureaus that have compiled and submitted them to the county governments for submission to the department include Shanghai, Huaian, and Gaoyou. More than a dozen counties have also sent letters to the fourth section of the Department of Education stating that they have compiled them and are waiting for the Education and Administration Committee to review them before submitting them for approval. It is estimated that the education budget for the 23rd year of the Republic of various counties can be submitted to the department by the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Boy Scout Education by Zheng Xiaocang <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Boy Scout education is a youth education full of life. It is an education of proactive health, an education of understanding nature, an education that emphasizes mutual assistance and cooperation, and an education that cultivates law-abiding attitudes and enterprising spirit.</p>
<p>It utilizes the tendency for activity, the tendency for gregariousness, and the tendency for [blank space] during youth, guiding them to strive for good and progress positively.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts were first established in 1908 (four years before the founding of the Republic of China). In just over twenty years, there are already more than two million Boy Scouts worldwide. Furthermore, recent methods of youth training in various countries seem to be derived from this.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts are a major contribution of the British nation to education. Although Duke Baden-Powell does not have a specialized book on educational theory, he has such a profound understanding of education. No wonder Dr. Snaedt (Professor of Education at Columbia University) often sighs that he is a "genius of education." I think his contribution to youth education is likely to be as great as Froebel's contribution to elementary education.</p>
<p>I have two hopes here:</p>
<p>(1) Education in middle schools should adopt its entire spirit and part of its method. This is "education for life." This is an education that promotes creating a "new life" and a new nation.</p>
<p>(2) If there is a way to extend it to young people in agriculture, industry, and commerce, with simple and inexpensive clothing and meaningful training, it would be a boon to the nation. Even if it is only an ideal at this time, realizing the ideal should be a goal for those who serve in the Boy Scouts and those engaged in social education.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Welcome to Mayor Shen, a Enthusiastic Supporter of National Goods <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>Mayor Shen Honglie of Qingdao is traveling south to inspect construction, education, and the national goods industry. He is passing through Shanghai, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various national goods organizations warmly welcome him to discuss cooperation between the two cities' industrial and commercial enterprises. The reporter also followed the comrades in the national goods industry to visit Qingdao and greatly admired Mayor Shen's concern for the development of the national goods industry, taking the prosperity of Qingdao as his mission. Last summer, the Qingdao National Goods Exhibition was opened under the leadership of Mayor Shen. Its business development broke the unprecedented record of various provinces and cities. We also personally listened to Mayor Shen's sincere advocacy of national goods, which inspired the leaders of the Shanghai and Qingdao national goods industries to organize businesses. Qingdi Ding Jingchen, Liu Zishan, and Wang Xin pioneered the Qingdao National Goods Company. At the same time, Fang Yixian, Cai Shengbai, Ren Shigang, Fang Jiange, and Li Zumo Xu Yangnan jointly established the Shandong United Sales Office of National Goods Factories. They all received Mayor Shen's support, which led to their success today. Therefore, not only the Qingdao business community is grateful for his enthusiasm, but also the Shanghai national goods community admires his good intentions. This is most welcome. Wang Xiaolai said, "Today, Shanghai merchants who regard Qingdao as a sales area should take a step further and regard Qingdao as an investment area." The reporter completely agrees with this statement and sincerely hopes that this summer, our national goods community and financial community will revisit Qingdao to seek the construction of the national goods industry, with Qingdao as an investment area for the financial and national goods community, to "curb the Japanese invasion and develop Qingdao's resources." This is what we especially hope for.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Spring Season of the "Women's National Goods Year" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>"The planning for the year lies in the spring," the ancients have clearly told us that the progress of any career must be based on a well-defined plan in the spring, and then in this year, we can follow this fixed procedure, continue to work hard, and reach the final goal. Naturally, although these are only a few words, they are a good mirror for the progress of our national goods industry.</p>
<p>We deeply know that in the past history, the soaring slogan of advocating national goods has now entered its second year - from the National Goods Year to the Women's National Goods Year. In this short process, because of our efforts, it has already achieved considerable results. As the cause indicates, we can take Nanjing Road, which is usually full of foreign goods, as an example. Previously, it was the base camp for imported goods, but now it has five or six national goods shopping malls, especially the China National Goods Company, which is the most complete and largest, becoming the "General Warehouse of National Goods," loved and supported by the public. In addition, the North National Goods Shopping Mall hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and yesterday, we heard that the South National Goods Shopping Mall has also opened. How great! Good news for national goods. All these things give us a good impression. However, on the other hand, last year's "new record of 900 million yuan in import surplus" and this time, "the United States raised silver prices, attempting to dump goods," makes us feel that the foundation we have established in the past is not enough, and it is necessary to expand the future. Now, I dare to put forward two sincere hopes, based on my personal opinions, and contribute them to the authorities in charge of our national goods industry, so that they can plan and implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(1) Establish national goods companies in various places. Mr. Pan Yangyao proposed a list of national goods companies to be established in various places in the previous issues of this journal, and detailed their total turnover and capital amount. How can we make them all come true in the shortest period of time, so as to form a national network of national goods, so that the enthusiastic call for advocating national goods is not only limited to a corner of the city, but also universally promoted to the inland - to all the rural areas.</p>
<p>(2) Determine the organization of national goods in this city. Although there are already many national goods sales organizations in Shanghai, it is necessary to reasonably regulate their business scope and region, in order to achieve more "twice the result with half the effort." Of course, we should pay attention to both not gathering in one place and facilitating residents to purchase nearby. Our future goal should be to continue to establish them in Hongkou, Zhabei, and western Shanghai, as they are suitable for the above two principles.</p>
<p>At this beautiful spring time, it is the time for us to devote ourselves to our careers. What's more, advocating national goods is our bounden duty and cannot be shirked. How will we embrace our mission, recognize our responsibility, and make a reasonable plan as soon as possible, and work hard to move forward, so as to be comparable to the Soviet Union's five-year plan, and achieve the greatest effect in this "Women's National Goods Year."</p>
<h3 id="e197">What are the Reasons for the Failure of the National Goods Movement? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yun</p>
<p>No matter what kind of movement, it is inevitable to use the power of propaganda as a starting point. However, under the great propaganda, the number of people in the society who respond naturally increases day by day. Then, there should be a systematic, realistic, and detailed content method made public so that this movement can move forward in an orderly manner when it is implemented and can really take effect. The movement itself will become stronger and more powerful: otherwise, although the propaganda effect is great, and there are many responses, it feels empty and difficult to find a real way to do it. Those who are interested feel hesitant and depressed: those who are perfunctory are willing to follow blindly and deceive each other. As a result, either a form is left in the society, or even the form is difficult to maintain, and the movement is ultimately ineffective.</p>
<p>Our national goods movement, although it did not start today, can be said to be at its peak today. What national goods year, women's national goods year, what lectures, parades, etc., have done a lot of propaganda work as a starting point. This may not be a good phenomenon, but because there are few practical and concrete measures in terms of implementation, the result of the movement has been that the import surplus has increased from 500 million yuan to 700 million yuan, which greatly disappoints us. Therefore, I personally hope that the national goods industry will pay attention to practical measures in the future in order to achieve the actual effect of the movement.</p>
<p>What kind of measures are considered practical and effective? This is a question that is difficult to answer in one word. I am not talented, and I can only briefly describe its principles. What are the principles?</p>
<p>(1) The government must have the determination to promote national goods and save profits. All orders for the national goods movement should be strictly investigated to see if the people are following them? Strict rewards and punishments should be given, and it should not be considered that the responsibility is completed with a mere document.</p>
<p>(2) Leaders from all walks of life should assist the government in investigating the performance of the people's compliance and report to the government at any time. They should also set an example in themselves.</p>
<p>(3) All sectors of industry and commerce should have mutual supervision and eliminate the evil nature of colluding with each other.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of civilian clothing, the first step is for education authorities in various places to fulfill the responsibility of guidance; the second step is for special investigation authorities in various counties and districts to conduct thorough investigations to determine punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Necessary Understanding of National Goods <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Advocating national goods is not useful by simply shouting slogans and posting slogans; nor is it considered to have fulfilled the responsibility by following everyone and shouting a few times "National Goods Year" and "Women's National Goods Year." In fact, we don't need this kind of empty verbal ornament - a nice-sounding term. We should all stand up and do it practically, to do the patriotic work that we should do; the first step of patriotic work should be to advocate national goods.</p>
<p>Since the wave of the global economic downturn entered China, our national finances have also been exhausted to this point; the bankruptcy of commercial markets and the collapse of the rural economy have in fact put China's future in a period of turmoil. In particular, the stagnation of the national goods industry; on the one hand, it is subjected to the economic invasion of foreign goods, and on the other hand, it is reduced by the purchase of the people, and it has been subjected to these two pressures invisibly. As a result, the national goods industry has plummeted and become unbearable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the people of our country have always had a heavy mentality of favoring imported goods, so the general modern fashionable figures, whether male or female, are all advocating foreignization in their clothing, food, housing, and transportation. According to the surveys obtained from all aspects, compared with the foreign goods imported by our country every year, its number is really astonishing!</p>
<p>We don't talk about saving the country, just let people say "cold-blooded animals" and "reserve troops for the slaves of the country." If we want to talk about saving the country, we must first love the country; the way to love the country is to advocate national goods and boycott foreign goods. However, if we want to advocate national goods, we must first recognize our position, hold on to our purpose, and at least have a deep understanding of the content of national goods. This is definitely not to show off and just shout on the mouth. Like this kind of incomplete and hypocritical concept, we should first eliminate it, otherwise the effect is equal to zero; because this is a great barrier to the promotion of national goods.</p>
<p>Originally, the responsibility of advocating national goods should be shared by all citizens; the so-called "the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man," is also the reason. I hope that those fashionable friends and modern women who love to use foreign goods will not be so obsessed with foreign goods, and quickly take a sense of conscience to love the country!</p>
<p>Finally, I myself am determined to adopt national goods for everything within the scope possible; (1) do not say that foreign goods are good, (2) do not say that national goods are bad, (3) encourage my family and children to love and use national goods, (4) persuade my relatives and friends to promote national goods, (5) as long as I think they are satisfactory, I will use them. At the same time, I only hope that our countrymen will also have a deep understanding of national goods and promote them as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Promoting National Goods and the New Life Movement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The New Life Movement of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame is so brilliant! Since it started in Nanchang, it has spread throughout the country, but how can we talk about etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame if we don't live a frugal life and tighten our degree of life?</p>
<p>To live a frugal life, we should first promote national goods, and start by purchasing and using national goods! In the New Life Covenant, in terms of clothing, item 9 "Clothes should be made of national goods," which is also implementing the New Life without forgetting national goods!</p>
<p>Confucius once said: "Do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak what is contrary to propriety, and do not move what is contrary to propriety." Now, Eastern, Western, and foreign goods are like charming women - fox spirits - sucking blood and cream, making a good China thin and emaciated. After implementing the New Life, I hope that the people of the country will not look at, listen to, speak of, or move non-national goods. This is "etiquette"!</p>
<p>"Sacrifice one's life for righteousness" and "righteousness cannot be agreed with." We should promote national goods, sparing no effort, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. Everyone should embrace the idea of being alone when everyone is drunk, and righteousness cannot be agreed with. The so-called "honesty and integrity in business" sells national goods, uses national goods, and believes in national goods. This is "righteousness"!</p>
<p>"Thriftiness to cultivate integrity" and "strictness and integrity in public service" are virtues that everyone should have! It is better to be frugal and purchase national goods, and cultivate the foundation of the country with integrity, so as not to allow the outflow of interests, which can be called "integrity"!</p>
<p>"Know shame and teach war" and "knowing shame is close to courage." But the country is not competitive and has suffered heavy shame, and has no ability to fight externally! Knowing shame and being brave in civil war, and being brave in buying enemy goods is really heartbreaking! There are also those shameless merchants who recognize thieves as fathers and use the money of their compatriots to seek the destruction of their own motherland. They are full of evil and their crimes are heinous! Dear compatriots, if we do not eliminate the traitors and exclude the imported goods from the East and the West, the shame will lead to economic destruction of the country, the destruction of the family, and the death of the people! Therefore, "know shame" and quickly use national goods! "Ming shame" quickly plan to deal with traitors, and deal with our enemies, and be ashamed to buy enemy goods! Be ashamed to be in the company of traitors! This is knowing "shame"! To sum up, the four words "etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame" should be started from one's own position by "promoting national goods"!</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Mission of Female Teachers in the Women's National Goods Year <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Youzhi</p>
<p>The object of education is students, and those who bear this educational responsibility are teachers. The words and deeds of teachers directly affect students and indirectly affect the entire society, because education is inseparable from society, guiding society on the one hand and improving society on the other. Therefore, we believe that teachers are in a position to lead the masses, not only to set an example for children, but also to further and practically serve as mentors to the masses. Only in this way can we achieve the long-term goals of education, and only then can teachers fulfill their responsibilities!</p>
<p>In the booming advocacy of national goods, although it requires the concerted efforts of the people of the country, the responsibilities of teachers are not small. On the one hand, they must publicize the significance of the national goods movement, and on the other hand, they must thoroughly transform the bad habit of loving to use foreign goods. Teachers can also be said to be people who are deeply rooted in the people, so it is of course easier to get started, and the results will be great in the future!</p>
<p>This year is the Women's National Goods Year, so of course it focuses on the women's national goods movement, which shows that in the past, women used a lot of foreign goods, and now they want to make a big turn in the right direction - adopting national goods. This is really a great project! What kind of efforts do women across the country need to make in order to achieve this: Of course, female teachers must take on even greater missions! This is undeniable! Women's education in China has not reached a considerable stage, and the level of knowledge is childish, which is a general phenomenon. And female teachers are intellectuals, and can be said to be outstanding among the common people. It is most suitable for them to be in a position to lead their female compatriots, and they can really be role models for the women's community! Therefore, we believe that female teachers are the pioneers of the Women's National Goods Year. If they can recognize their own position and set an example, the future of the women's national goods movement will be full of unlimited light!</p>
<p>If the minds of female teachers are only filled with foreignization, fabrics, decorations, and daily necessities, and they only seek foreign goods, this is the "foreign-style education" that has harmed them, which is tantamount to a policy of suicide and self-destruction! Not only is it of no benefit to society and the country, but it is also a scourge! I can give an example. There is a female teacher in a rural primary school, who can be considered to have a good relationship with the local area. Ordinary rural women often accompany her and are gradually influenced by the female teacher. Their hair is cut, their faces are painted with snow cream, and their clothes are made of foreign cloth cheongsams. In this way, they seem to have changed their faces and have completely turned into modern girls. I feel that the power of this female teacher is really great, and maybe in the near future, those village girls will paint their eyebrows, apply rouge, and wear high heels like this female teacher! Naturally, there are good and bad points here, but after all, the bad points outweigh the good points several times! The female teacher has simply become a model salesperson for foreign goods! It is reasonable to say that they should not have fallen from the supreme and noble position to the miserable situation of being lowly and declining:</p>
<p>To put it another way: teachers are called teachers because they can teach children. Children's psychology is malleable, and we must cultivate them to develop good habits so that they can devote themselves to the country and become good citizens in the future. If they have been trained to maturity, there is no need to have a national goods movement when they become adults! And aren't the students taught by female teachers following this common goal! Shouldn't that be advocating national goods?</p>

<p>- Children's Impressions of National Goods -</p>
<p>This year's Children's Day was very lively. Newspapers published special issues, held meetings, recreational activities, and receptions. Everything was to hope for children and wish them well, so that they would become successful and healthy citizens in the future and win honor for the country! To let foreigners respect them and honor their ancestors!</p>
<p>In the Women's National Goods Year, influenced by the mother or sister's love for national goods, the children's small minds will also be imprinted with the excellent impression of using national goods!</p>
<p>Just like my children, who are very young, already know to buy national goods at the China National Goods Company. Therefore, I hope that female compatriots will want to raise young citizens to do great things to avenge the country and revive China. You should first cultivate the seedlings of young citizens to love and use national goods, so that there will be hope of realization!</p>
<p>I wrote this short article after Children's Day to make compatriots not join in the fun for a while and be indifferent in the future, but to pay attention at all times!</p>

<p>(1) Golden Sands Everywhere</p>
<p>In the spring, peach blossoms are blooming everywhere inside and outside the city of Beiping, as if competing for beauty; when a gust of wind passes, fallen flowers cover the ground, as if laying a crimson carpet; in the air, you can smell the strong fragrance of other flowers at any time.</p>
<p>On a certain street, the ground is covered with golden sand, and a large group of people and horses are advancing mightily. The ranks are extremely neat and solemn. Except for the light and crisp rustling sound of people and horses trampling on the sand, nothing else can be heard.</p>
<p>Many people in splendid costumes, riding horses and wearing朝 hats decorated with sable tails, form a brilliant team. The horses under them are all of the best Mongolian breed, with smooth fur and long, neat tails, which often emit dazzling light. The saddles are inlaid with precious jewels, and the stirrups also have very beautiful decorations. On average, each horse has at least four or five different colors. Hundreds of horses gathered together, coupled with the reflection of the sun, make it a spectacular sight, as bright as clouds!</p>
<p>Behind the dust raised by these horses, about ten or twenty steps apart, is a large, foldable sedan chair that shines with the brilliance of gold. On both sides of the sedan chair are painted two golden dragons with bared teeth and claws. Sixteen eunuchs are carrying the sedan chair. Inside this sedan chair, sitting as still as a deity in a temple, is the Empress Dowager Cixi of the time, the ruler of China's 400 million people. (3)</p>

<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>The Suzhou flower market can be described as [renowned since ancient times]. If you take a rickshaw, you can see many flower sheds at Tiger Hill and Shantang, covered with reed curtains on top and flowers hidden underneath. When the weather is sunny and the air is mild, and the curtains are rolled up to reveal the flowers, although you can't smell the fragrance, it seems to waft into the carriage.</p>
<p>Also, when staying at a hostel near Adai Bridge, in the early morning, you often see groups of women carrying bamboo baskets selling white orchid flowers, disturbing your peaceful dreams and arousing your idle sentiments. This also shows that the Suzhou flower market [is still thriving].</p>
<p>Speaking of plum blossoms, Dengwei Mountain is naturally the most well-established. The phrase "Fragrant Snow Sea" often lingers in people's minds. However, in recent years, due to the limited production of plums, many have been replaced with mulberry trees. It's truly a transformation from sea to mulberry field, far inferior to the prosperity of Wuxi. Zhang's Garden, a rising star, still has much to offer. In addition, Lengxiang Pavilion, although having a small amount, is merely a dependent state, a situation of partial peace.</p>
<p>There is a plum blossom tree in Li Yin's old home, which came from Anhui. The trunk is seven or eight inches in circumference, leaning as if drunk, with flower branches slanting out from the top, like hair fluttering in the wind, scattered with fragrance, intoxicating people. Mr. Xu Yunqiu happened to be present and took out a photograph from his side to show me. The scene was similar, but more twisted and coiled, appearing even more ancient. He said it was a relic of the famous painter Gu Heyi. When Heyi was alive, a Japanese painter saw it and offered five hundred taels of silver to buy it. Heyi refused, and the Japanese painter took a photograph and included it in his travelogue, saying that it was at least a hundred years old.</p>
<p>This year, the magnolia flowers in my home are blooming exceptionally well, totaling about five hundred. The gentle breeze shakes the white blossoms, and the warm sun reflects the light. It truly feels solemn and brilliant. If described in Western words, calling it sacred would be most fitting.</p>
<p>These days, when the carriage passes through the south of the city, most of the new buildings are decorated with a few flowering trees, with pink and red blossoms peeking out from the low walls, reminding one of the poem [Spring colors fill the garden, unable to be confined], truly feeling that flowers are the daughters of the era.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Impact of Undermining Modernity <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>According to reports, a strange group [undermining modernity] has been discovered in Hangzhou. It is now the Qingming Festival season, and Hangzhou's commerce has always relied on the spring and autumn outings for a large portion of its income. In the past, due to floods, the tide-watching was canceled. According to people in the business community, each store in the city made five million less in business. This shows that Fan Wenzheng's governance of Hangzhou, allowing people to compete in dragon boat races, and monks and Taoists building temples and monasteries, allowed people with surplus money to spend it, and those with skills could earn money by using their strength. It was truly a wonderful strategy for relieving unemployment and regulating finance. If modern figures were to regard Hangzhou as a dangerous place and stop visiting, it would affect the city's commerce and become a suicidal policy for the people of Hangzhou. In fact, rayon has taken the place of silk, and wool has taken the sales of silk and cotton, not in the form of modern or not modern. Then, glamorous attire and Western clothing are still just forms. If domestic silk is used for glamorous attire and Western clothing, I don't think it will be ruined by strong water.</p>
<p>Because someone asked me if Hangzhou is safe to visit, I said that it definitely won't ruin your clothes. However, when foreigners come to China to preach, they even change to wear our Chinese clothing. We are not going to foreign countries to be foreign slaves, so why do we need to change to wear Western clothing?</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Six: Generously Baring His Heart, Forgetting Family and Serving the Nation; Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror, Sighing for My Yearning Heart</p>
<p>Gui Zhi nodded slightly, without saying a word. Ms. Jiang said: "Go to sleep, don't think about anything." Gui Zhi was also afraid that her mother would worry, so she nodded and said in a low voice: "I'm going to sleep now. It's cold tonight." As she spoke, she reached out to unbutton her clothes. Moreover, with drowsy eyes, she even yawned twice, indicating that she was absolutely going to sleep. Seeing her in this state, Ms. Jiang naturally didn't say anything more, closed the door for her and quietly left. Gui Zhi closed the door, walked to the table, and also wanted to move the lamp and go to bed. Because there was a mirror next to the lamp, she thought, "Do I have a sad look on my face? Why would my mother see through my thoughts?" So she sat down again, held the mirror with both hands, and looked at her face closely in the light. This time, she finally saw her face clearly. Her eyes, from the outside to the inside, were all red, and her round cheeks now had two prominent cheekbones. They were definitely not like the skin of a water chestnut and the color of peach petals when she was a bride. Looking at her own reflection, and then looking up at the photograph hanging on the wall, she couldn't help but sigh. Suddenly, Ms. Jiang said outside the window: "Young lady, you said you were going to sleep, why aren't you sleeping yet?" Then Zhao Weng also said: "Yes, the weather is quite cold, don't catch a cold." Gui Zhi then understood that the two old people hadn't slept yet, so she replied: "I'm going to sleep now, I'm going to sleep now." She answered and actually went to bed to sleep. But not wanting to sleep, yet forcing herself to sleep, made it even harder to fall asleep. As a result, she lay on the pillow and thought even more wildly. This night's fantasies planted countless seeds of sorrow in Gui Zhi, and the future changes were something that Gui Zhi herself could not have imagined. (354)</p>

<p>In the lonely night, I always like to walk to the solemn Huangpu River, wandering alone on the pier, under the statue of Peace, in the shadows of the street trees.</p>
<p>Tonight there is no moon, no wind, the yellow micro-waves flow quietly, the river is covered with a hazy night, the ships are buried in thick smoke, and the bright lights shine like eyeballs: the reflection of the lights on the water, dot by dot, line by line, like tails of stars in the sky, like winding golden snakes.</p>
<p>The river stretches out mightily, Pudong floats on it like an isolated island; the tall chimneys on the foreign warehouses are not emitting black smoke, as if a person has stopped breathing and died!</p>
<p>From that dark, distant edge, the red lights of the city ferry appear, puffing and panting, carrying a few passengers, come: on summer night, it is so gorgeous, stringing small red and green electric lights into a streamer, brilliantly surrounding on the body, hugging many noble guests enjoying the cool, singing the popular songs of radio, stepping on the foxtrot dance posture, flying on the river like a light swallow, ferry! At that time, you have been fascinated too much</p>

<h3 id="e208">Research on Inkstones (16) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Bored Guest</p>
<p>General Situation of She Inkstones</p>
<p>(1) Assessment and Discussion of She and Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>She inkstones are produced on Longwei Mountain in Wuyuan, Huizhou. According to Xin'an Zhi, during the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, a hunter named Ye chased a beast to the Great Wall and saw叠stones that were crystal clear. He brought them back and made inkstones. They were warmer and more moist than Duanxi inkstones. He held them to the command and presented them. During the reign of Emperor Yuanzong of the Southern Tang Dynasty, the governor of She presented the stone to the court and recommended the inkstone craftsman Li Shaowei, who was promoted to inkstone official. The name of She inkstone became famous from then on. The Inkstone Manual also says that the Chengxintang paper used by Li Houzhu, the Li Tinggui ink, and the Longwei stone inkstone were the best in the world. It is a beautiful story passed down in history. At that time, Duanxi inkstones were not yet famous, so commentators only praised She. Later, the mining of the Lower Rock stone of Duanxi gradually increased, and the number of people praising the Lower Rock of Duanxi increased. As a result, inkstone commentators were divided into two factions, one saying that the firmness and inking ability of She stone was better than Duan, and the other saying that the warmth, fineness and density of Duan stone was better than She. Each held one view. We can fairly say that both have their merits. The Relics of the Inkstone Forest says: "Longwei is like a clear and cold Taoist, often seeing opportunities; Duan stone is like a romantic scholar, with a bright and smooth body." This theory is the most fair. Ouyang Xiu and Su Dongpo both loved and valued this product, because the Longwei of She and the North Wall stone of Duan are as moist and greasy as melted wax. Unfortunately, the old pits of Longwei were abandoned as early as the Northern Song Dynasty. The new pits that have been produced since then are not as good as the old pits. The Lower Rock of Duanxi has become more and more refined, and the new pits are better than the old pits. This is why Duan stone has created its unique position.</p>
<p>(2) She Stones are divided into five grades. According to Tang Hengquan's "Theory of Inkstones," She inkstones are divided into five categories, all of which are generally firm, smooth, and good for inking, with those with gold stars that are clearly visible and bright, and as brilliant as gold paint, being the most valuable. The best ones have a shape like a dragon's tail and are called Dragon Tail Gold Stars. The next best are those with gold stars scattered like fallen flower petals. All those with gold stars must have a greenish stone color. In addition to the gold stars, there are other patterns like reed flowers, or like woven silk, or like eyebrows, or like brushed silk; the patterns are all white, faintly like silver. These four types are the next best (but the good ones are also very rare). As for the stone without patterns, it is not all ordinary stone. There is a kind of stone with a slightly rough texture, which feels sharp to the touch, so it is very good for inking, and is also a good one. The above is a distinction based on stone grade.</p>
<p>(3) Old Pits and New Pits, Inkstone Theory also calls the Longwei Old Pit, which is also a cobblestone that is difficult to find in large sizes. The color is light blue-black, clear as autumn water, and has no patterns. When immersed in water, it seems slightly purple, and it is as fine and smooth as jade, or faintly has white patterns, forming mountains and rivers, ink cattle, stars, moon, and other different images. When dry, it is hidden, and when inking, it is like oil, silent, and the edge does not fade after long use. Or there are those that are pure black like horns, which are valuable. The old pits in the Southern Tang Dynasty had them, but they no longer exist now. The new pit also has a blue-black color without patterns, and it is dry, abrasive, and the ink fades. After a long time, it becomes dull and lacking. The other old pit grades such as Luowen are all blue-black in color, and their value is not reduced from Longwei. If the new pit's four grades are drier than the old pit, and the patterns are also coarser. It also says: The gold stars of the new and old pits are both coarse and dry, and the color is also light blue-black. The places with stars are not suitable for grinding ink, and workers often take it from the side, and place the stars on the outside, calling it the gold star wall. The silver stars of the new and old pits (the surface has many white dots like millet, which are silver stars) are also light blue-black, and coarse and dry like gold stars. The above is a distinction based on new and old pits.</p>
<p>Young men and women, distinguished guests, but when you have slipped away from the age of youth, removed the beautiful decorations, there are not many young men and women distinguished guests to come into your arms!</p>
<p>I sighed softly at the lonely ferry. The iron chains of the crane were still rumbling on the dock. The muffled shouts of the coolies, and the songs of the home-sick sailors, played a Volga boatmen's song together.</p>

<p>Unfavorable Foreign Telegrams Lead to Market Fatigue</p>
<p>The Results of Central Bank Cash Opening are Still Flat</p>
<p>The gold market continued to decline yesterday, but the situation in the first half of the day was tired but still stable. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market continued to rise in both the UK and the US. Although the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange fell slightly by three hairs to two li, the ground report showed that people's hearts were still firm. In addition, the exchange rate soared unanimously. Although London raw gold shrank by three and a half pence, and US cotton rose by five pounds, and US wheat shrank by 125, people's hearts were still tired. The wool market opened and fell to 52 yuan, but retail investors tried to make up for it and stabilize it. The Associated Press reported that the silver bill had been submitted to the Senate for discussion, and the situation was flat and tired. After the opening, the anticipation that HSBC would list US exchange rates at a length of 25 cents, and Reuters reported that the US Treasury Department proposed to exchange public bonds for the fourth phase of free public bonds worth 100 million yuan, and Treasury bonds worth 244 million yuan, caused some setbacks. The Central Bank opened a cash bid and turned stable. The market then tightened suddenly, and the US exchange rate gradually improved. The gold market then gradually rose. The swap spread was one yuan, and the red gold price was calculated at 966 yuan. The Central Bank opened 350 pieces of cash, which were done by Yinfengheng, and the price was calculated at 954 yuan and seven dimes and a half (it was quite early, and later other spot numbers wanted to do it, but the price was already high).

The long positions were also worried about the four-day holiday, so they made some [moves] to avoid danger. However, most of them were still struggling, and the trend still had a relatively large amount of hovering. On the trading floor, large investors entered and exited in large amounts, with sellers being more active in comparison. It is feared that it will be difficult to see the highest record of 56 yuan and three corners again in the future April salt tax. Yesterday's experience showed that the market situation was quite like a storm was coming. At the opening, the selling pressure from large investors and retail investors was extremely strong, and the market price fell more and more sharply. The long-term salt tax fell sharply by seven corners and a half. The falling momentum was too rapid, and there was short covering in the next session. The 14th was the most active in buying in, and the market price rebounded very quickly. The consolidated tax rebounded by six corners and a half, and even exceeded the fall of the first session. The market reopened in the afternoon, and the selling from the 16th, 17th, and 37th, etc. was still strong, and the decline resumed. The 20th lost [small half of a yuan], and although the closing trading was relatively sparse, the market price rebounded slightly by two or three corners again. The overall trend was suddenly rising and falling, quite chaotic, and presented a downward curve. In total, the market price continued to shrink by a small amount of two or three corners to four corners and a half. Among them, the long-term 18th customs and the disarmament 19th customs were still slightly better by five cents to one or two corners. The total transaction volume was 17,805,000 yuan. There was no spot trading opened. Now, the results of the rise and fall are listed for comparison as follows (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). Also, the market will be closed for three days from today.</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Feng &amp; Co. based on the Wall Street Journal, yesterday's stock market was mediocre and lackluster, showing a slight divergence. Many traders remained on the sidelines, awaiting developments in Washington to discern the trend. Mining stocks, particularly copper, rose towards the end, driven by the prediction of the president of a US metallurgy company that copper and silver prices would rise. In the foreign exchange market, inflationary sentiment was again strong, and some speculators predicted that gold prices would rise. The US dollar fell sharply against the British pound. The minor exchange market was slightly higher with mixed performance. Bonds and US government bonds were firm, while grains were loose. Goods...</p>

<p>There was no significant change. According to a report from our New York agent, (securities) (Illegible Characters) due to favorable comments from leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors and the apparent modification of the exchange's proposal. (Wheat) Northwest (Illegible Characters) rain caused market sentiment to weaken, while the situation in the Southwest remained unchanged. The chaos in Washington was most likely to have a negative impact, causing traders to hesitate. (Cotton) Commercial reports were positive, and the market awaited increased demand from yarn factories. The outcome of the Punk Hai case and silver legislation showed progress in market sentiment. If the situation develops favorably, it will not be difficult for prices to rise. The total volume of trading for the day was 1.33 million shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Stocks in Warehouses Increase Daily</p>
<p>Totaling 36,155 bales at the end of March.</p>
<p>The amount of yarn stored in the warehouses of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange is increasing daily as factories release their inventory, putting significant pressure on the market. As a result, market prices have fallen sharply recently. Spot yarn prices in April reached a new low since 19(Illegible Character), reaching 167.9 yuan, a decrease of 17.1 yuan compared to the highest price of 185 yuan on March 15th. Spot cotton prices in April were 42.3 yuan, a decrease of only 1.5 yuan. A comparison of the two reveals the difficulties faced by the factories. Xin Shen Factory, aware of the hardship caused by cheap yarn and expensive cotton, once considered purchasing and convening factories to unite and maintain prices. However, each factory only cared about their immediate interests and continued to release their yarn into warehouses. Consequently, Xin Shen Factory, seeing the unfavorable situation, painfully liquidated all 40,000 bales. This is the origin of the rumor spread by Japanese merchants. As of March 31st, the total was 36,155 bales. The breakdown is listed below:</p>
<p>Count Brand Name Number of Bales Count Brand Name Number of Bales</p>
<p>20 Count Ren Zhong 16,085 20 Count Cai Hua 6,500</p>

<p>Total 36,155 bales</p>
<p>Spot Market Closed for Spring Holiday</p>
<p>Spot Yarn and Cotton Sales Remain Sluggish</p>
<p>The yarn market closed for the Spring Holiday. Spot cotton yarn merchants gathered in the market, but transactions remained sporadic. No group had a significant appetite, so market sentiment was calm. However, the US and Indian cotton markets rose slightly, but this did not stimulate sales, due to tight credit conditions. The total amount purchased by all groups for the day was only 106 bales. There was no afternoon market. The amounts purchased by each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 35 Guangdong 50 Nanyang 5</p>
<p>Fujian 4 Ningbo 2 Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>The cotton market remained dull, and market sentiment was scattered. However, US and Indian cotton prices rose, while the yarn market in this city declined, causing difficulties for the factories. Imports of raw materials were slow, leading to an increasingly sluggish market.</p>
<p>US Cotton Initially Fell but Ultimately Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market initially fell due to foreign merchants selling, but later rose due to short covering and a strong rebound on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose 5 points and futures prices rose 1 to 7 points. Liverpool spot cotton rose 6 points and futures fell 3 points. Egyptian spot cotton rose 3 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to European exporters selling July futures. As a result, Pingal rose 3 rupees, Oomra rose 1 rupee 75 cents, and White Rocks rose 4 rupees.

<p>(Shanghai South) Over 40 groups arrived (over 6,000 piculs). Initially, the market was slightly firm with sellers calling for higher prices due to the cloudy weather. Then, drizzling rain tightened the situation. However, the changing clouds made it difficult to predict, and the brief improvement quickly vanished, turning into a slight decline. Although purchases by the Nanyang group ceased, the Northern Ports group purchased 2,450 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian late rice varieties, and prices remained relatively stable. Regular Bang Su Tong and Nangang thick glutinous rice varieties showed a pattern of strong initial demand followed by a decline in urban and rural stores, and prices remained normal and similar to before. The price of Du Yangjian remained the same due to balanced supply and demand, and Yin Yuan remained average.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 20 vessels arrived from the river ports, and sales were limited due to the rain in the early morning. Most merchants did not open their scales, and the market remained firm.</p>

<p>Mid-Grade Xian Rice Continues to Rise by 5 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Guest Xian rice market continued to show good prospects. Due to high production costs, merchants received price limits from the producing areas and were unwilling to sell easily. All higher-grade rice varieties were offered at prices 20 cents higher, but buyers considered the prices too high and did not inquire. Mid-grade varieties had more stock, with new arrivals from various locations along the Yangtze River and north of the Yangtze. The market price could not be increased significantly. Yesterday, due to the activity of (Illegible Character) merchants, prices also rose by 5-6 cents. However, local merchants and Han merchants in this city directly chartered a shallow-water vessel in Changsha, fully loaded with Hunan rice, and shipped it directly from Hunan to Shanghai, expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. Therefore, merchants were not as optimistic about mid-grade Xian rice as they were about higher-grade varieties. A total of 5,588 bags were sold, with 224 bags going to Wenzhou, 400 bags going to this street, and the rest going to Fuzhou from the Min province group.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Yellow Soybean Sales Less Active Than Before <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market was less active than the previous day. Only factories were purchasing, with no other inquiries. Factories purchased 1,800 bags of Guide soybeans at a price of 2.6 yuan, 1,200 bags of Dangshan soybeans at a price of 2.58 to 2.55 yuan, and 500 bags of Xuzhou soybeans at a price of 2.5 yuan. The market price was adjusted down by 2-3 cents. No train carloads of soybeans were opened. The future trend is likely to remain flat and sluggish.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Coarse and White Sugar Prices Rise by 5 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly better, but imports and exports were still not smooth. The association set the price of ordinary coarse white sugar at 19.85 yuan, an increase of 5 cents from the previous day. Stock in this godown was 19.95 yuan, with unchanged original prices for 89 number Ho Red sugar. Taikoo Sugar B (Illegible Character) remained at 20.25 yuan, standing firm. Zhen Ji Number One factory's fine white sugar was 18.4 yuan, with few transactions at the quoted price. Only over 100 bags of Shi Long red sugar were offered at a price of 13.5 yuan, and 60 bags of Lei Dan red sugar were offered at a price of 13.3 yuan. The Chao Qing market remained stable without further offers. Merchants were not eager to import due to low sales, resulting in a lack of transactions. It was reported that white slab sugar from Hong Kong would be shipped to Shanghai. This type of sugar has never been imported before and is being tested in the market. Samples were discussed with merchants yesterday, but the selling price has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The orchid bamboo branches produced in Zhangzhou experienced a small number of transactions in the middle of last month, and the market showed a slight upward trend. However, sales soon became sluggish again, causing the market price to decline again. It was found that the Fair Wheel imported only 40 boxes from Xiamen the day before. Although the number of arrivals was small, sales were also low, making it difficult to change the situation. It was heard that there was also little stock on the ground, and the purchase price had increased instead, creating a situation of upside-down prices. The market was exceptionally dull.</p>

<p>(Hang Shao Agriculture, Sericulture, and Hatchery Improvement Seeds) The Zhejiang Construction Department is keenly improving silk, organizing a Silk Improvement Committee, notifying all counties about agricultural, sericultural, and hatchery improvement seeds, issuing prohibitions on the sale of native breeds, as the Qingming Festival approaches, early silkworm farmers are about to release silkworm eggs, and late silkworm farmers have already hatched them. This year, farmers in Linping, Yuhang, Changan, Haiyan, and other places are all hatching improved breeds. It is regrettable that due to low prices last year, the number of eggs hatched is not smooth, and native breeds have been eliminated. Recently, the weather has been unfavorable, with overcast rain and cold, which has been unfavorable for hatching. Therefore, the silkworm eggs of early silkworms are emerging unevenly. As the peak hatching season arrives, the weather is gradually turning sunny and warm, and agricultural sericulture is now progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>(Thirty Bales of Doupion Silk Shipped to Bombay) The demand for doupion silk in India remains strong, while Shanghai's inventory is limited. The British ship that arrived the day before yesterday only exported thirty bales of doupion silk, destined for Bombay.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Filature Silk Sales to Europe Remain Sluggish) The overseas raw silk market was closed for three days due to Christmas. No telegrams arrived in Shanghai from New York. Although there was some trading of white filature silk in London, the incoming prices remained low, and actual sales in Lyon were stagnant. Market sentiment remained sluggish, and a turnaround in silk sales is unlikely in the short term. Yesterday, only eight bales of yellow silk were imported by Bo Hing and other companies, and prices remained depressed.</p>

<p>Imports of Japanese woolen fabrics have increased sharply, and sales have been particularly strong. Sales by customers from Sichuan, Tianjin, Changsha, and local streets have become even more active. Among industry operators, those dealing in Japanese goods account for sixty to seventy percent, and Western goods and other goods have been greatly affected. Therefore, it was resolved in the public meeting to sell all Japanese goods before the middle of this month, after which sales will be suspended. As a result, the selling price of Japanese goods has seen a drop, such as retail sales in stores falling considerably. However, non-member stores and customers are still secretly trading. The guild is currently planning measures to address this.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Talking About Ghosts <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, folklorists have researched that superstitions about ghosts and gods are not entirely psychological, but mostly caused by the material environment. Life in the north is difficult, with severe winters and hot summers, so people cannot help but emphasize material things. The natural environment in the south is better, which allows for leisure in life, so the spirit can be more active. A class of sorcerers has emerged in society, specializing in making trouble among people. Wu and Chu have had many licentious sacrifices since ancient times.</p>
<p>However, a few charitable halls or Tongshan Societies cannot promote people's superstitions if people do not need ghosts and gods or if superstitions do not have a traditional foundation. China is a [theocracy], and ghosts and gods originally had objective material functions, not subjective spiritual responses or supernatural powers.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, a group of people live unsatisfactorily, have nowhere to express their feelings, and have nowhere to appeal their grievances. [They cannot afford to file a lawsuit], so they can only resent heaven and earth and pray to ghosts and gods, taking the other party to the City God Temple to ask the Bodhisattva to judge. The [oaths] of ancient times were like this!</p>
<p>Good must be rewarded, evil must be punished, either extending life for several decades or bringing disaster to descendants. These theories of cause and effect may be valuable to this nation and are all attached to ghosts and gods. However, [in a well-governed world, its ghosts are not divine]. The creation of ghosts and gods mostly occurs in times of turmoil. Many people think that the prevalence of Buddhism in recent years is a phenomenon of [people thinking about harmony], but they do not know that this is a manifestation of [people thinking about chaos]. The situation is not peaceful, people have lost their self-confidence, have no joy in life, and in desperation, can only hope for other lives, Pure Land, and heaven, and seek help from the ghosts and gods in the dark.</p>
<p>Just imagine, how many out of 400 million people are not afraid of ghosts? How common are ancestral halls and temples everywhere! Especially like the modern times of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Northern and Southern Dynasties, how can ox gods and snake ghosts not come out to stroll around [the big world] and relax! Of course, this is an era of great achievement for ghosts and gods. The ancients [laid down the butcher knife and became a Buddha on the spot]; today's people [lay down the Buddhist scriptures and pick up the butcher knife again]. Warlords and bandits bow their heads when they enter the temple, but kill people when they leave the temple. The more turmoil there is, the more prosperous the ghosts and gods are!</p>
<p>Pu Songling was good at talking about ghosts, and Wang Yuyang had a poem that said: [Let's talk nonsense and listen to it nonsense. Rain is like silk on the bean trellis and melon frame (Note: This is the realm of ghosts!). It is expected that you are tired of talking about human affairs and love to listen to ghosts singing poetry in autumn graves!] Perhaps he was not very happy living either, and seeing the ghost world might be better than the human world!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Qingming <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Daizi</p>
<p>I haven't been back to my war-torn hometown for several years. In this wicked city, as long as I am bored, the scenery of my hometown, with its bright flowers and dark willows, always unfolds in front of my eyes. Leaning against the green mountains with lush forests and bamboo, extending a green wheat field, following the wheat field, there is a stream of slowly flowing spring water with weeping willows on both banks. Here, you can often see some leisurely fishermen, squatting on the smooth rocks by the stream, basking in the sun and fishing. The buzzing of the yellow bees under the willow leaves is almost催人入睡(lulling people to sleep). Ah, that is such a peaceful village, such a quiet paradise!</p>
<p>In the past, during the Qingming Festival, when I and my younger brother followed my mother to visit the grave here, after kowtowing in front of my father's tombstone, we would run to the tenant's house. A group of familiar barefoot children would surround us, enthusiastically bringing tea and cigarettes, looking at the silk mandarin jackets on me and my brother with surprised eyes. When my brother and I made a fuss about going fishing, the children would happily抢着(scramble to) take the fishing rods and baskets. My mother was afraid that we would fall into the water, but the children's fathers all said [Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.] To reassure my mother, they even sent a young and strong man to protect us. I remember that the strong man patted his chest and said, [My name is Shui Sheng, water is no problem, I'm here!] We蜂子朝王似的(like bees swarming a queen) surrounded Shui Sheng and ran to the stream. When we caught a few fish, we thought we would have fresh fish to eat today. But as soon as we stepped into Shui Sheng's house, the table in the living room was already full of plates of big pieces of fish and meat, and they immediately urged my mother and us to sit at the upper seat. The fish caught today were for us to take to the city. Shui Sheng's eldest brother carried a风雨灯(storm lantern) on the way to see us off and said: [If you like fish, I will catch some more for you tomorrow.] We always brought some fish into the city every Qingming.</p>
<p>Later, we still went to visit the grave every year as usual. Our age increased, but荒芜(desolation) could be seen everywhere. The only thing left by the stream were the empty weeping willows. Shui Sheng and some strong men all said that they were [drafted] and never seen again. Our tenant was another person with the surname Wang. My mother said, [This old Wang is very hateful, don't look at his old age, he will play some tricks. If you don't pay enough rent, he will be evicted.] I felt that my mother had also changed. In the past, every time she came to visit the grave, she always happily told us some wonderful stories about the village, but now she didn't even put down her mind of calculating accounts for a moment. As soon as she walked to Lao Wang's door, my mother shouted about the rent problem, [You have to pay, we have to pay five years of food in one year!] My mother said with an iron face, and Lao Wang撲的(suddenly) knelt down. Lao Wang唠唠叨叨(chattered endlessly), and my mother唠唠叨叨(chattered endlessly) too. We had no food to eat that day, no fish to catch, we came into the city empty-handed, listening to my mother's complaints.</p>
<p>Later, I left my hometown, although the scenery of bright flowers and dark willows always unfolded in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Rather than saying that I missed the quiet hometown, it would be better to say that the ruthless life of the city made me too uncomfortable. After several years of war, I actually made a big decision to go back. The city was already very desolate. Many of the once lively hotels and restaurants were closed. Although a few more red-light smoking houses had been added, there were very few people walking on the streets very early. As for my mother, she was lying next to her own opium lamp and looked even older. Whenever she mentioned the rent grain after the flood, she sighed and complained constantly. She had not dared to go to my father's tomb for a long time. But in order to hope that my father would bless us, my mother asked me to take advantage of the recent peace to visit the grave during this Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>The hometown scenery that I had often dreamed of was now realistically presented in front of my eyes again. The mountains were still lush with forests and bamboo, the water was still lined with weeping willows on both banks, but most of the fields were乱草(weeds), and people were looking at us with a pair of thief-like eyes. Hearing the sound of the wind in the treetops, it would make people suspect that something sinister was hidden in the阴森处(gloomy place), and one or two槛褛(shabby) men walking towards us with winking eyes would make people suspect that the coarse hand hidden under their clothes was摸着(feeling) a shiny steel knife. When my mother came today, she had originally decided to take this opportunity to find Lao Wang, but after kowtowing in front of my father's tombstone, my mother urged us to quickly pack up the offerings and go into the city before the sun set. At this time, if you stood in front of this tomb and looked at the森森(gloomy) mountains and streams, it really seemed as if a rough hand could reach out from anywhere. We couldn't help but毛发悚然(feeling our hair stand on end). My mother said with great regret [Shouldn't have come, shouldn't have come.] We entered the city today捏着一把汗(with our hearts in our throats). As soon as I entered the city, I took a deep breath; [Ah, hometown!]</p>

<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Opening Remy de Gourmont's [Le Livre des Masques], and flipping through it, you can see one cartoon after another by Vallotton. One of them may particularly attract your attention. It is a face drawn with a curve, with two small circles replacing the eyes. That is Jules Renard (1864-1910), the author of [Poil de Carotte].</p>
<p>Although looking back now, I feel that Renard is not such a great writer, around 1925, in the aura of symbolism surrounding me, Renard, Vildrac, and even the Catholic poet Claudel, all became my favorite writers. Renard's [Poil de Carotte] particularly pleased me.</p>
<p>Renard was a French local writer. Naturally, his works do not reflect the complex social life in Zola's [Les Rougon-Macquart]. However, in exposing the disharmonious points in the rural society at the end of the century, his work [Poil de Carotte] cannot be said to be without considerable significance. If we open the book [Poil de Carotte] and look at the cartoons drawn by Vallotton, we will all feel Renard's sarcasm and tears. In fact, I have not read the novel [Poil de Carotte] (1894) in detail. What I have read in detail is the one-act play [Poil de Carotte] that he adapted later. That gave me great satisfaction at the time. Renard can also be said to be a naturalist writer. In [Poil de Carotte], he accurately described the characters of his characters and their natural environment.</p>
<p>[Poil de Carotte] depicts the entanglement of a well-to-do landlord family in the countryside. A family of four, father, mother, elder son, and younger son. The father and mother are not on good terms. The father does not talk to the mother. Except for sometimes going to the city to file a lawsuit, the father goes out for hunting and other gentry-style pastimes. He is lonely. The mother is also lonely. The mother suffers from hysteria and often goes to the monk to pass the time. The book does not say whether she has any ambiguous points with the monk. If it is said that she is going to repent, but when she returns home, she tries her best to torture her youngest son. There seems to be a [unspeakable secret] between husband and wife. The mother loves the elder son. The father loves the younger son, but the mother dislikes him. She tries her best to manipulate her youngest son, and her son stubbornly and Confucianly argues with her. Although he is a boarding student in a middle school in the city, he has to go home for summer vacation. When he is at home, there is a play to be staged at home. On a summer afternoon, that one-act comedy is realized. I think this comedy of family disputes is quite meaningful.</p>
<p>However, although Renard pointed out that the family is a collection of people who do not understand each other, he has never been able to give a sociological explanation. His failure to understand society was naturally caused by the French social environment at the time. He can only passively negate it. He found a way out: to find comfort in [nature]. However, can nature really comfort unfortunate people?</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I was in Beiping, I translated the script of [Poil de Carotte]. At that time, the translation name was [Carrot Hair], which was published in the supplement of the North China Daily. Last year, Mr. Lin Qu also published a good translation of the novel [Carrot Whiskers] in [Free Talk]. Although it is not a great work, it is also very beneficial to translate it. But my idea is that for the sake of popularization, it is better to translate the title as [Red Hair], which is more concise. I don't know what Mr. Lin Qu thinks?</p>
<p>Renard has been dead for more than 20 years, and it is now the 70th anniversary of his birth. At this time, I hope that the novel [Carrot Whiskers] can be published as a single volume. However, the translator should add a critical preface. The Vallotton woodcuts are also best inserted.</p>

<p>The next day was even more worthy of writing about: we were going to take a train to Juyongguan, which was more than ten minutes away. We got on the train at a station [whose name I unfortunately forgot again] and bought third-class tickets, but there was no room for another leg in the third-class carriage. A railway employee enthusiastically went to check the second-class carriage for us, but there was no empty seat either. He said generously:</p>
<p>[Then you can stand in this first and second class carriage, it's only a little more than ten minutes away.]</p>
<p>We had no choice but to listen to him. As each of us stepped up, the train moved forward.</p>
<p>Before we had stood firm, a military policeman of the 某团(certain regiment) in a grass-green woolen uniform suddenly popped up. He was short and always held his head up.</p>
<p>[Where are you from?].</p>
<p>He spoke Mandarin with a Hunan accent, using a voice like shouting slogans to soldiers. Before anyone could answer, he said the second sentence:</p>
<p>[You can't stand here.]</p>
<p>This time the voice was louder, full of a martial spirit.</p>
<p>[We're getting off at Juyongguan, it's not far.]</p>
<p>One of us said this.</p>
<p>[Don't you know, there are [important people] here!]</p>
<p>He said as if disaster was imminent. This was a bit strange. Everyone looked around at the same time, wanting to see how [important] the [important people] were.</p>
<p>But that military policeman [important people] shouted again　　 [Don't you know the stakes?]</p>
<p>When saying this, 威风(his majesty)　　　　, 好像(as if) we were all his enemies. 那时(At that time)　我倒想(I wanted to)　一　　,　　摄影家(photographer), 将那姿式照了下来(to take a picture of that pose), 倒也可以启发民族精神(It can also inspire national spirit).</p>
<p>Several people who knew the stakes advocated moving around, but there was really nowhere to go, so they had to stand in the area where the two carriages were connected. Afterwards, because we were standing outside the carriage, we had no way to see what happened. We don't know if that brave man was like　胜归来(returning in triumph), 经过凯旋门(passed through the Arc de Triomphe) with得意(complacency).</p>
<p>We suffered a bit, the carriage traveled through the mountain tunnel, and the coal smoke choked us so much that we dared not breathe.</p>
<p>Since this section has been written, the most exciting part is completed, and there is no need to continue writing. What can be added is that we actually returned to Beiping, none of us missing.</p>

<p>[Alas! I'm really sad. Such a day is worth celebrating for Japanese students, celebrating their empire's gaining of new territory, celebrating the initial success of their warlords' aggression policy. But what reason, what face do Chinese students, no, even "Manchukuo" students, a large group of slaves, have to do this kind of thing! Perhaps that's why the students are not happy and don't easily laugh. I hope that every student can think carefully about what kind of day this is, so that it can be said that the oppressed Chinese nation has not died out. It's hateful that the training director and his gang of Manchus are willing to be slaves, constantly suppressing the students' speech and monitoring their actions, only knowing to desperately promote the kindness of the friendly country and the virtue of the new country]!</p>
<p>As I was thinking, the team had already lined up in a commotion, curving into two rows. I don't know where, the shadow of the principal appeared. She was probably here to teach us something again. As soon as I saw her, I got angry. She was really a糊涂东西(confused person) who knew nothing. Her妖冶(seductive) dress was disgusting. Her name was Mao Hegen. I heard that she was a student from a Japanese women's high school. After the incident, she returned to the province. She slept with the great traitor 洽(Qi Qia) in the [Zui Xian Restaurant] for one night, and because she could speak a few words of Japanese, she was appointed as the principal of the women's high school a few days later. Otherwise, how could such a person with bad conduct and insufficient learning be the principal of the women's high school? No one in the province doesn't know that the principal of the women's high school is a高等野鸡(high-class prostitute)! No one knows that she can't even write a letter! But no matter what, she has been the principal for almost two years, and no one dares to take her position. When she is the principal, she only goes to school four or five times each semester. What does she do for the rest of the days? Where did she go? God knows, this is the educational talent of [Manchukuo]!</p>
<p>She spoke, her voice still as small as a mosquito. She said:</p>
<p>[Students, we are going to the sports field today to hold a celebration meeting, celebrating the ninth, eighteen, and ninth, fifteen anniversaries. Because of the September 18th Incident, [Manchukuo] was given the opportunity to raise its head; because of the friendly country's recognition on September 15th, our [Manchukuo] became an independent country in the world. In饮水思源(gratitude), we cannot but thank the friendly country for its kindness. You understand this meaning, so you are not in vain to receive a new education.]</p>

<h3 id="e240">Observations on the New Life Movement <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The call of the New Life Movement resounded like thunder. We read various declarations, speeches, and records about the New Life Movement in the newspaper every day. We felt that a kind of vigor had emerged in this　here country. Although it did not stimulate people's emotions like a storm, this peaceful and inspiring moral power, which leads people to a healthy and beautiful life, also has a great effect on the people who are unwilling to live in a careless manner.</p>
<p>Advocating a new life naturally negates the old life; what is the content of the old life? Perhaps it is necessary to say a few words about it here first.</p>
<p>First, in terms of the meaning of the times, the old life should refer to the life of the remaining feudal style and the life of capital plunder. For example, the lives of landlords, gentry, and unscrupulous merchants are all engaged in plundering other people's blood and sweat for a living, which is the so-called parasitic life. Secondly, in terms of the meaning of labor, there are many old remnants and young masters in China, as well as young masters from洋场(foreign concessions), who live a life of extravagance and desire without labor. Nowadays, there is also a kind of extortion life prevalent in society, that is, relying on a force to extort a group of weak people without power for a living.</p>
<p>There is also a large group of people in the old life who do not know how to live and are unable to live. They live a life of begging from door to door in荒村野店(remote villages) or街头巷尾(streets and alleys) every day.</p>
<p>The above is from the economic side, saying that the old life has so many meaningless contents. If we focus on the spiritual side, we can point out more and worse contents.</p>
<p>The first is that people's hearts are treacherous, and everything is讲求(particular about) using means: the second is laziness and vulgarity. This habit is almost a universal phenomenon in the so-called upper class,穿(dressing), 吃(eating), 喝(drinking) are readily available. The rich, big masters, or children of prominent families, and ladies who are装成(disguised) by money inherited from their ancestors or剥夺(seized) by themselves, these people are idle all day long, so they only smoke opium, play mahjong, play poker, watch movies, go to dance halls, dog tracks,回力球场(jai alai courts), gambling houses, or go to XX prostitutes, in order to消磨(while away) this life. Most of the middle class are also idle, do not want to work, and are perfunctory in their work. They would rather not work and sit at home in depression or go to seduce women. The lower class can't even talk about human life. Maybe it's not that they want to be lazy and vulgar, just because they have nothing to do, and they haven't climbed to the upper or middle class. These lazy and vulgar habits will make China's real social life more degenerate, and they are also cultivated by China's social environment.</p>
<p>The content of the old life is as corrupt as the above-mentioned尖儿尖儿的(pointed), so the advocacy of a new life is of course天经地义(right and proper), and no one should disagree. But what should be the content of the new life? In addition to the礼义廉耻(four cardinal principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame), 清洁(cleanliness), 朴俭(thrift), etc., which are suggested by the important people of the time, we feel that we need to supplement a few more points in depth.</p>
<p>That is, the New Life Movement should also pay attention to the actual lives of a group of people, reduce people's suffering from hunger and cold with the greatest effort, reduce the behavior of剥削(exploitation) in the world with severe sanctions, and implement labor life and eliminate parasitic life with effective methods.</p>
<p>To win a great achievement in this New Life Movement, it is not enough to rely solely on the call of leading figures. We should mobilize the power of the masses, pay attention to organized activities, and continue for a long time. Otherwise, it is also empty talk.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Layoffs <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Recently, a layer of gloom has clouded everyone's heart, and a kind of flustered expression floats on everyone's face.</p>
<p>No, it can't be said like that. This flustered expression is not floating on everyone's face uniformly. At least, most people are still showing a cheerful expression, as if they haven't realized that the unfortunate event of [layoffs] has happened. Those who realize it are only a small part of the majority!</p>
<p>Perhaps it's a kind of abnormal expression? After this news came out, work seemed to become more tense. The accumulated work slid by very quickly. This effect is rarely seen normally. In fact? Emptiness fills their hearts, being struck by a huge hammer, and what bursts out are sparks of emptiness that splash across their chests!</p>
<p>|| How is it? What news have you heard? ||</p>
<p>|| I wonder if this news is true?</p>
<p>Yes, people always ask this involuntarily when they reach a certain level of extreme tension and panic, even though afterward, they clearly know that the object of their inquiry is equally clueless.</p>
<p>The gloom has become heavier, heavier, so heavy that it blocks out even a breath of air. However, they still have to struggle, struggle, because only in struggle can there be a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>In normal times, they always feel that time passes too quickly, and a day goes by in the blink of an eye. But now? They hate that it runs so slowly, neither dead nor alive, dragging on, adding more intense worry, annoyance, and boredom to everyone's body.</p>
<p>|| Well, get ready to roll up the bedding! Little Zhang said very seriously.</p>
<p>|| Huh? You: : : You, where: : : :?</p>
<p>Immediately, many people surrounded him, their eyes especially big, big, emitting flames, their faces piled with thick solemnity.</p>
<p>|| Where did you get the news?</p>
<p>|| Hmph, still don't believe it? Old Li saw it with his own eyes in XX office.</p>
<p>With suspicious hearts, the gathered people dispersed. They couldn't help but think to themselves:</p>
<p>|| Perhaps it won't be as many as he said? And, perhaps my name won't be among them? Hey, I've been here for six years! I haven't made any mistakes, and I haven't taken any leave. Maybe this will matter: : : : : :?</p>
<p>|| However, who dares to be so sure? If he insists on firing you, then, then: : : : Alas! There are still a wife, daughters, and mother at home, a burden of five or six people. My meager salary doesn't allow for any savings. What will happen then: : : :!</p>
<p>Their brains were dizzy, burning, almost exploding.</p>
<p>[Everything is destined. What's the use of thinking? Damn it, I don't have any connections. Let it be!] In the end, when there was no other choice, they could only shift all the responsibility onto [fate].</p>
<p>The event finally erupted one afternoon.</p>
<p>A notice was written in neat characters, so dark, so complete. Attached behind was a slip of paper. On that paper, each word was jumping incessantly.</p>
<p>This time, two section members, four clerks, and twelve employees!</p>
<p>Silently, the laid-off employees were organizing their belongings in their drawers, silently walking out of that gray,沉沉門, silently leaving a deep, bitter smile for the rest.</p>
<p>The next day, the office was quiet. The scene was very desolate. The energy of life had escaped. A layer of desolation struck deep into the hearts of those who remained.</p>
<p>Not many days later, the news came again:</p>
<p>|| It's not good. After the layoffs, the degree of contraction still doesn't match the budget. Now, the second batch is underway.</p>
<p>This was a bomb placed in front of their faces. For some reason, the previous panic was gone. All that could be seen was the even more severe sternness on everyone's face.</p>

<h3 id="e242">A Crude Psychoanalytic Study of Consanguineous Marriage <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Bing</p>
<p>Yesterday, this publication carried an article by Mr. Lüsha on the issue of bloodlines being too close for marriage. This is an issue that Chinese people have always considered unproblematic. Just think about the deeply disgusted attitude that society takes towards love between young men and women of the same bloodline, and you can see how affirmative the word "unsuitable" already is. No matter how much the new figures who reject the cannibalistic nature of the old ethics and teachings, few dare to doubt the authority established by the old ethics and teachings on this matter. From this, we know that if all issues are not examined from a correct historical and scientific perspective, then the so-called work of destroying and expanding the clearing of the old ethics and teachings is nothing more than romantic momentum. Mr. Lüsha cited historical facts of consanguineous marriage and the prevalent marriage system in the Japanese imperial family as counter-evidence, which is very appropriate in his argument. According to the explanation of the American modern psychologist A.T. Reid, the terror of incest in human psychology and ethics has only developed relatively recently. In the ancient dynasties of Egypt and Peru, incest was practiced. Ancient Shintoism was also very lenient on this, and the authors of Genesis must have recognized the concept of incest as the only basis for explaining the descendants of Adam and Eve. Fraser said it well: [There is no law that encourages people to eat and drink, nor is there a law that prohibits people from being placed on fire. Because people drink and eat in the first place and do not burn their hands is due to instinct.] If people were naturally averse to incest, then there would be no need to legislate to force them to avoid it.</p>
<p>Toreton believes that the origin of incest is due to the fact that children of both sexes in the family have been together since childhood, so the first sexual desire that occurs naturally aims at the opposite sex who is close. As for the fact that all races have adopted strict legislation to ban it without prior agreement, that is because the elders of ancient tribes often monopolized the females and rejected the males, and were eventually killed by the joint efforts of the youths, and the youths each thought of monopolizing and rejecting the others, so they killed each other, so they agreed not to commit this offense to show prevention.</p>
<p>Mr. Lüsha believes that scholars criticize close relatives for marriage in order to prevent the double transmission of special genetic defects in the bloodline to their descendants. However, Toreton has a unique explanation for this: he believes that in the modern social system, the difficulty of bearing the burden of marriage makes the generally unhealthy elements tend to avoid difficulties and take the easy way out when it comes to the responsibility of marriage, and love between blood relatives often becomes a shortcut for such people to satisfy their desires. On the other hand, weak people do not have the confidence to compete in the social arena, so they choose people with close bloodlines (because close bloodlines have many conveniences in terms of approach) as their marriage partners, which is the general reason for consanguineous marriage. Since this kind of people are inherently endowed with deformity, it is only natural that their offspring are not strong. From this point of view, defects should be the cause and inheritance should be the proper result. Mr. Lüsha's view that inheritance is the cause and defects are the result is precisely a reversal of cause and effect.</p>

<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>｜Two Strangers｜</p>
<p>In the southern goods department of S Company on Nanjing Road, there was a young customer who had just paid a dollar to have a piece of ham he had bought wrapped up by a shop assistant. Suddenly, he picked up the piece of ham, looked at it back and forth, and then put it down again. [I really don't know if this piece is good or not,] he said, as if soliciting the shop assistant's opinion.</p>
<p>[This piece of ham is not bad: : :,] A woman who was standing next to the young man, dressed like a young woman, was also buying something. Obviously, she didn't know the young man. Suddenly, she reached over and picked up the piece of ham and looked at it, saying to herself. This was not strange at all. Everyone was a customer.</p>
<p>[Thank you,] the young man turned around and nodded to her very humbly. His consciousness seemed to have gone beyond the scope of everyone being customers.</p>
<p>The ham had already been wrapped up and sent to the original counter by another shop assistant. The young man had to leave dejectedly. However, as soon as he turned around, he went to the foreign goods department and looked at this and that, and finally bought a tie.</p>
<p>The young man turned around and saw that the woman had already held a large bag of things under her arm and was walking towards him. The young man had been walking very slowly, but now he was dragging his feet on the ground, waiting for the woman to approach. [Are you free today? You bought so many things]. The young man's tone was flat and steady. The pace under his feet had already accelerated, matching the woman's, and they walked side by side.</p>
<p>The woman turned her head to look at him, but did not reply.</p>
<p>[It's quite heavy. Can I hold it for you?]</p>
<p>The woman seemed to smile, but still didn't say anything. The young man didn't wait for her second more obvious expression of consent, and his hands had already reached under her arm to replace the paper bag under his own arm. The two people walked, walked, even closer.</p>
<p>[Is there anything else you want to buy? Can we find a place to talk?] the young man asked.</p>
<p>[Why not? But I originally wanted to take a bath when I came out,] the woman said.</p>
<p>[Then, it's your treat, okay?] the young man said with a cheeky face.</p>
<p>[Why not?]</p>
<p>But the woman didn't mean to go out the door, but instead stepped into the elevator, so the young man had to follow in. At this time, the young man was really hesitant. He thought: [Can this really happen? Would she really treat? No way, no way! But I have nothing left but the two dimes I have left. What if: : : what do I do? And my family told me to buy this piece of ham and bring it back. I have to send it home today. Is it a trap? No way. Then, what should I do: : : Never mind, I'll see what happens to her in the end. Anyway, I only have two dimes on me.] The young man finally made an explorer-like decision.</p>
<p>The elevator stopped. They came out and walked to a hotel. Then, led by a waiter, they entered a quiet room. After filling out the circulation book, the woman took out a ten-dollar bill from her handbag, paid the waiter, and turned to the young man and said: [Do you need to eat something]? The answer was no. The waiter then retreated, and at the same time, the air in the room suddenly jumped up.</p>
<p>[Can you tell me your name?] the young man asked.</p>
<p>[Why are you so infatuated? I don't ask your name, and you don't have to ask mine, isn't that good?]</p>
<p>[Didn't you say you wanted to take a bath?]</p>
<p>[Now that I have you, I don't need it.]</p>
<p>Saying that, she sent a charming smile [Right?]</p>
<p>A drunken kiss melted their two hearts.</p>
<p>They satisfied their desires. It was late at night. When the two walked out of the company, the young man asked:</p>
<p>[When will we meet again?]</p>
<p>There was no answer. (End)</p>

<p>— Person</p>
<p>Five years ago, what great castles in the air floated in my mind, but after five years, five years later, today, besides the illusions before disillusionment, I dare not hope for anything anymore. I already know that Mr. What [school is a small society] is a lie. If school is really a small society, how can the first step I take into society make me tremble and shrink back and be at a loss what to do? [School is not a small society, but society is the real school.] This is the answer that two years of service have given me.</p>
<p>With the knowledge sold by teachers, I thought I was very full and rushed into society to make a living with good intentions. Therefore, in addition to being despised for my shallow knowledge and impracticality, I was unable to get enough to live on due to lack of qualifications. Therefore, I also know that qualifications are indispensable on the road to making a living. Oh! The current society has given us young people another kind of shackle. Qualification! On the road to making a living, you also need qualification as a backing!</p>
<p>For the sake of qualification, an unforgettable and cursed memory flashes into my mind. It was three years ago! I, that weak and pitiful me, had a burning desire to enter university, but to enter university, I had to have a high school diploma, so I stepped into school to get this so-called diploma, and on the other hand, give the desire for knowledge a chance to be satisfied. Trembling, I went to the school to register, and I was able to get the director of studies to agree and say: [Take the transfer certificate slowly, you can pay the fee and register for class first.] Things were decided like this. Except for paying the fee, there were no procedures, and I could move my bedding and luggage to school. I was full of enthusiasm and went to class with rapid steps, and then came back from class.</p>
<p>The classroom was so noisy that I couldn't believe it was a classroom. There were people singing, chewing peanuts, knitting velvet ropes, talking and laughing, sleeping, all kinds of strange things. Of course! What would the teacher ask the students to do? Only making trouble and fooling around are homework!</p>
<p>Each book is a thick, western-style, gold-lettered hardcover book. Inside, there are crab-shaped characters, as well as triangles! Sines! Vertical coordinates, horizontal coordinates: : : : : : I am really a little scared, but, strangely, at the same time, there is a slight heat in my heart because I think that this semester, I can get a lot of knowledge. But for a month, the book is still a brand new book. Later, I didn't even recognize our teacher's name. Because there were too few opportunities for our teachers and students to interact, the school authorities did not consider the needs of our students. For example, the task of using thoughts should be placed in the morning, but in fact, it was placed in the afternoon. Also, for example, the task of teaching six hours a week will be taught in two days｜three hours in a row each day. In this way, in terms of time, it is supplemented, but whether it is beneficial to students is a question that seems not very serious.</p>
<p>So, in school, you can eat, dress, sleep, fool around, spend money. You can ignore everything.</p>
<p>The school's dark secrets were exposed layer by layer, and my mysterious longing gradually faded. [Is school society?] I cannot deny the iron-like answer that two years of service have given me.</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>After reading your publication's amateur mailbox yesterday, I am willing to contribute a little bit of my humble opinion to the readers, as a source of exploration, in order to achieve the goal of reducing the crisis of young people, based on the condition that your publication gathers ideas and benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Of course, [sexual desire is innate. It cannot be stopped,] so when young people reach a considerable age, after development is completed, they feel sexual boredom and the temptation of the opposite sex due to psychological and physiological impulses. This is the natural order. We should follow nature to find an object to make a reasonable marital union, as Mr. So-and-so said in his letter. Because economic conditions cannot be sufficient, he gives up the obligation to form a family. When the inner burning is strong, he uses the method of looking for flowers and asking willows to complete his dream of stealing jade and warming fragrance. This kind of behavior is nothing more than supporting the existence of the prostitution system, which will solidify the position of prostitutes in society. If the trend is spread, it will make the entire society fall into an unimaginable situation. Even the method of setting up a bureau to check and examine, which was proposed by Mr. So-and-so, is a wasteful attempt. In my opinion, in order to eliminate the urban evils of sexually transmitted diseases that are popular today, we should first correct the erroneous views before there is hope of a thorough clarification. If there are absurd people who indulge in Qin Lou Chu Guan because of the greed of carnal desire and the temptation of pornography, then the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases is not the fault of society but the self-inflicted misfortune of the patient. Moreover, the formation of society is the general term for the collection of individuals. If each young man and woman strictly promotes the formation of a rational family with one husband and one wife, prostitutes will naturally disappear and sexually transmitted diseases will naturally disappear.

<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>4. Bangkok</p>
<p>Bangkok is the capital of Siam. Because of the convenience of water and land transportation, Bangkok is not only the political center of Siam, but also the commercial hub of the entire country. When the ship enters the Chao Phraya River, we can see many strange buildings: some are like wooden pavilions, some are like terraces, some are like pigeon cages, and some are like castles. Different wooden houses are sparsely dotted along the Chao Phraya River. The most special thing is that those wooden houses are not built on land, but float on the river surface or are supported by wooden piles in the water. At the entrance of each wooden house, there is a small boat that is less than five feet long and can only accommodate one person. This is their means of transportation. Even children who are three or five years old can row small boats in the vast Chao Phraya River.</p>
<p>When the ship arrives at the dock, it is a different scene. There are lively roads and modern buildings. All the material civilization of the city is probably available here. If it were not for the extra-large rickshaws that can seat two people side by side, which make you feel unfamiliar, you would suspect that you have returned to Shantou or Shanghai, because not only the form of the shops is no different from the shops in Chinese cities, but also most of the clerks in the shops and the passers-by are our compatriots.</p>
<p>5. Strange Customs</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters can be husbands and wives</p>
<p>It is rare for brothers and sisters to marry each other in modern civilized countries, except for barbaric nations. However, this strange custom is still prevalent in the Siamese royal family. It is said that when the first king was plotting to usurp Zheng Zhao, his wife - Zheng Zhao's daughter - also participated in the secrets. Later, when he became king, he was afraid that his son-in-law would also follow suit, so he did not allow his grandsons to marry wives from outside. They could only marry their sisters. At the same time, if there was more than one princess, the rest would not be allowed to marry either, and would stay in the palace for life. From then on, the monarchs of Siam followed this practice without any doubt, even to this day.</p>
