<h3>爲承認僞滿問題警告各國　廷</h3>
<p>按照國際法的原則大凡一個新國家要想加入國際社會而和其他國家發生外交常道的關係不可不先得各國的承認然後他的「國格」才算完備無論什麽國家本有承認新國家的自由但是有些新國家乃由舊國家分化出來而且没有充分安定的基礎或眞正獨立的身分如果貿然把他承認便會犯干涉原主國内政的嫌疑甚至足以引起國際的戰爭亦說不定即如在美國宣布獨立的初年英國正在進兵平亂而法國已過早的把美國承認了英國大不滿意逕行對法宣戰就是極明顯的例子</p>
<p>傀儡組織的僞滿「不能認爲由眞正的及自然的獨立運動所産生」早經國聯調查團明白指點出來很深刻的印入世界人士的腦海中僞滿之不配承認當然毫無疑問的餘地何况經過一九三二年一月七日美國國務卿史汀生照會的聲明同年三月十一日國聯全體大會的决議和一九三三年六月七日國聯特别大會顧問委員會的通告所謂不承認的原則已更進一步由理論主張而具國際義務的面目這樣看來那些受不承認原則束縛的國家無論其束縛力的性質是爲道德的或法律的當然不能不格外堅持其固定的政策了可是據最近電訊居然有德國快要承認僞滿和美國或可放棄史汀生主義的消息如果這種消息成爲事實那末我國數年來向外哭訴呼籲的點點血涙固然盡付東流毫無價值可信而空洞的國際同情之不可久恃亦當給我們以莫大的教訓</p>
<p>假定關係各國果眞要放棄了不承認的原則而和僞滿正式携手我們可以想像其藉口的理由不外下列二端</p>
<p>第一僞滿由日本一手造成而日本之承認僞滿亦爲最早可是中國除在日本承認當時提出抗議外迄今仍和日本維持友好關係那末他國繼起而承認僞組織結果縱和中國邦交有多少不良的影響而其惡化程度决不至超過現在中日邦交之上則可以斷定何况承認僞組織可以換得重大的利益權衡輕重决非不智</p>
<p>第二國聯議决案的精神固須尊重而現實問題亦應顧到中國雖然没有作放棄滿洲主權的表示而數年來中國上下並未作積極恢復故土的運動則爲事實那末他國對於叛變者認爲事實上業已獨立亦無不可換句話說由中國的消極態度可以證明其無法制服叛徒因此據國際法的解釋中國亦便不能阻止他國履行其承認新國家的義務和自由</p>
<p>這種心理如果屬實我們不能不認爲根本錯誤神聖不可侵犯的國聯决議可以憑空推翻還有什麽國際公道國際信義可言又何必再去責罰日本破壞條約的暴舉我國所以和日本維持外交關係不過出於事實上的需要無可奈何據此一端就說中日友好未免過甚至於指僞滿的組織爲叛變結果亦嫌不盡不實要知道叛國漢奸只居全滿民衆的極少數其餘那個不眷念祖國而渴望擺脫異民族的覊絆萬一各國「爲德不卒」而竟有承認僞滿的荒謬舉動我中國人民必將有極嚴重之表示而决不甘心</p>
<p>同時我們又覺得要想各國繼續維持其不承認政策還須我們自己爭氣否則縱由各國繼續其不承認對於現狀不至於有何補助而東北四省則根本亡定了過去的剌激和打撃已經受得不少我們還不直截爽快脚踏實地的向本身方面去努力以求光復故土的最後勝利嗎</p>

<p>（倫敦）　據報端消息、美國一方對於「滿洲國」現擬變更態度、一方並擬要求菲律濱羣島、接受菲島獨立原案、（係美國國會議員霍斯及克丁二人所提出者）而以接受後十五年、美國將菲島所有軍事根據地悉予放棄爲交換條件、英國保守黨一部份人士聞此消息、頗表歡迎、該派人士對於美日兩國關係趨於緊張、向表惋惜、晨報即係代表此種傾向最顯著之報紙、該報對於上項消息、雖表贊同、但提出重要保留、謂美國從前提倡滿洲維持原狀之政策時、曾得歐洲各國之贊助、今如變更原來政策、則英國政府之態度、當與美國相策應、此美國所當慮及者、近聞德國爲商業上理由、擬即承認「滿洲國」政府、若美國亦擬作同樣行動、則必先與各國曾經援助美國採取不承認「滿洲國」之舊政策者、商得同意而後可、美國設不若是而單獨有所行動、恐非光明正大之道云云、（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　晨報評論意國與奥匈携手以成多瑙河同盟之計畫、謂意國對奥政策、似覺逾度、意國顯圖結合奥匈兩國成一堅固之團體、而由意國駕馭之、此舉固不論其經濟性質、而在政治上實有重大關係、此種團體志在與小恊約國爲抗、不特不能消除現有之危險、且反將增甚之云（二十三日國民社電）</p>

<h3>日政黨政治之怪現象（日本通信）</h3>
<p>受賄問題　政黨分裂</p>
<p>日本第六十五議會開幕以來、荒木因對内部統制力而辭職、於是政黨的勢力、似乎向上高漲、而立憲政治大有復興的可能、但是在這當中、却發生了兩種極堪注意的問題、第一是文部大臣鳩山一郎在買賣股票丨商國人造絲與神户製鋼兩種股票丨從中經紀、收受五萬圓的賄賂、現在議會中爲岡本一己氏所暴露、第二是因第一問題聯帶而來的政友會的分裂運動、即是床次竹二郎與久原房之助相呼應、與鳩山爲難、迫其辭職、造成倒閣的基礎、同時就是政黨的分裂運動、</p>
<p>原來日本的議會政治、僅有原敬内閣時代、算是勉强的名實相當、那時候也是歐戰剛了、一般人正渴望着和平的建設、所以財閥纔能於中取利、政黨政治、纔走上正路、但是自從世界經濟恐慌發生以後、軍國主義的主張、逐漸抬頭、特别是前年五月十五犬養毅首相、在任内被剌後、立憲政治僅存軀殼、一切政治暗地裏都由軍人支配、一般人民也再不信任議會、至少是對議會冷淡、可是盲目的軍事行動、并不能解决當前的經濟困難、也不能克服日本國内政治上的矛看、因此軍部的信譽、也徒存空名、依然與民衆要求相背馳、</p>
<p>最顯著的是南滿鐵道公司改組問題發生之後、民間股東自不免發生恐慌、即依滿鐵以週轉活動的兩大政黨、也大感威脅、怕將來要受巨大的限制、完全聽命於軍部、所以在六十五議會休會終了、開會時即開始攻撃軍部、以表明政黨的立塲、藉此挽回政黨的頽勢、殊不知這問題還没有得到正式的答案、議會内部與齋藤内閣、就發生了極其嚴重的問題、就日本政局的推移、齋藤内閣本缺少確實的穏定性、雖然齋藤是海軍閥的先輩、雖然他已取得軍部的同情、但是政民兩黨、總有些不妥洽的地方、彼此常常衝突、明年度的豫算案、在閣僚内費了九牛二虎之力纔得成立、議會中的大風濤、却又在豫算案通過之前就起來了、</p>
<p>這此風潮、起於議員岡本一己的暴露政府醜態的演說、說是鳩山一郎文相、曾收受五萬圓賄賂案、經小山司法大臣調查的結果、申明（一）鳩山一郎没有起訴猶豫的事實、（二）收受樺太工業的五萬圓、在事實上并無根據、（三）從前樺太（即庫頁島南部）工業會社社長大川平三郎與鳩山一郎之間、雖曾有過捐贈選舉費五萬圓的事、但純係個人的捐寄行爲、絶對没有構成犯罪的性質、單就政府方面、就法律的表面而論、鳩山的名譽、内閣的信用、大概都没有什麽問題、現在算是暫且保存着了、</p>
<p>然而却又發生了另一問題、即是岡本氏有虚構事實之嫌、所以將岡本付查問、澈底清查這件事、究其實、岡本提出鳩山受賄案、并不是單純的個人行動、裏面還含得有很嚴重的政治意味、即是在政友會裏邊頗有附合岡本、從事於倒閣和分裂政黨運動的人、在政友會幹部方面、以爲岡本氏既虚構事實、有損於彼個人、更不利於政黨、致議會政治的信譽、根本失墜、所以要徹底清查、如有黨員和他通謀、就要用紊亂黨紀的罪名、加以除名的處分、但是元老派當中的床次竹二郎、則主張愼重、久原房之助、則暗中爲岡本作支援、并聯絡民政黨·國民同盟·與其他中立派、以從事於倒閣運動、</p>
<p>政友會内自原敬死後、就分裂過一次、犬養被害後、鈴木繼任總裁、即形成羣雄割據的形勢、將來有總裁資格的人、在元老方面爲床次、在財閥中當算是久原、而少壯派中則首推鳩山一郎、并且鳩山與鈴木三郎、有姻戚係、他現在又是國務大臣、所以進行甚爲便利、因此久原派·床次派·更要聯合起來打他、於是政友會内部的糾紛、更見厲害了、假定眞正分裂、則政友會所餘的議員、竟會减少至百名左右、亦未可知、（一九三四年二月十七日於東京）</p>
<h3>顔惠慶在平演講中俄關係</h3>
<p>復交爲文章之第一段</p>
<p>外交之將來要靠自己</p>
<p>北平通信、北平外交月報社、昨（二十）晚假歐美同學會歡迎颜惠慶大使、並邀各界名人作陪、便餐後、於八時起由顔使演說中俄關係及遠東大勢、顔氏首述在日内瓦與蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫談判復交經過、此事辦理之機密與神速、已爲世人所知、毋庸贅述、惟當李維諾夫抵日内瓦時、外交界盛傳李將與某國簽一重要恊定、空氣頗爲緊張、至復交換文發表、所謂重要恊定者、非與某國乃與中國、大家多覺吃驚、顔氏謂我們國家雖然弱、亦不必太輕視自己、猶憶民國六年中國對德絶交時、外交部之絶交照會、即係由兄弟送往德國使館、德人明知中國不能派一兵一卒参戰、亦不能派一隻戰艦到歐洲、但德國公使看了照會、臉上立刻變色、因爲中國有偌大領土、四萬萬人民、這四萬萬人都說德國不對、而加入與己對敵的戰綫、是很可怕的、此次蘇俄對華復交、意義也是如此、倘與四萬萬人爲敵、於蘇俄是不利的、復交不過是文章之第一段、此後的文章將如何作、復交之後、國内盛傳將有經濟考察團、實業考察團等赴俄、後意寂然無聞、本人曾迭電外交部催促、現仍盼望國人將此事實現、此次美俄復交、予曾遇美國大使於巴黎、所帶館員多至八十餘人、大多數爲辦理商務者、非戰公約規定不能以武力作侵略之工具、蘇俄對外貿易、買賣均由國營、力量非常之大、誰對我好、即買　的貨、誰對我不好、即不買誰的貨、操縱如意、在對外行動上、不下於武力、現在美國商家結合大團體、增大力量、俾對蘇俄之國營貿易够一個敵體資格、這一點也是國人應當注意的、譬如茶葉向爲對俄輸出之大宗、茶商現應聯合起來、組織一個大團體、次談中東路問題之概要、謂中俄關係、除東北方面外、尚有西北方面之新疆、俄國原有西伯利亚鐵路、又沿新疆邊界修築一條土西鐵路、我國入新疆、原本只有兩路、現因内戰、東邊之路不通、只有蘇俄一路可通、所以新省經濟大權完全在蘇俄手中、彼欲賣貴、則新人别無他物代替俄貨、彼欲買賤、則新人别無他土可以銷貨、一切由人操縱、所以從經濟上觀、新疆已是蘇俄囊中之物、蘇俄目前對新疆、確無領土慾望、因從經濟上看、亦無佔土之必要、而亦利於鞏固漢人政權、因漢人失勢、回族代起、回族又不統一、必起爭執、勢將引起西伯利亚和回族之活動、使蘇俄内部不安、至於外交之將來、完全要靠自己、自己努力、一切有希望、自己不努力、一切無辦法、從一方面南疆組織僞府攝影之三此片係烏思滿去後、纒頭等實行變亂、組織僞政府、在疏附城外行懸僞新國旗禮時（旗係綠色）仿土耳其式、所攝、（新聞昨日本報）</p>

<p>說、中國無事不是外交、理財治政、都有外國關係、但從另一方面說、則一切不關外交、無内政即無外交、内政不修、外交無事可辦、顔氏談至此、述其對國聯之感想、謂中國民族一向主張和平、所以此後仍須以和平爲主、所有維持和平之機關、中國决予擁護、但同時亦須對國民提倡尚武精神、凖備武力、非爲打人、而爲抵抗、最後謂一般國人國家觀念薄弱、實爲中國之最大危機、所以希望國人都要有深厚的國家觀念云云、顔氏演說歷一小時之久、最後尚有自由問答、盡歡而散、（二十一日）</p>

<p>各項稅收一落千丈</p>
<p>廢歷年關金融停滯</p>

<h3>意飛行家希望中國發展航空事業</h3>
<p>昨日下午招待報界茶會</p>
<p>詳述意國發展航空經過</p>
<p>即將晉京拜會我國當局</p>
<p>意大利著名飛行家裴那第大佐、爲向我國各界宣傳提倡民用航空事業起見、曾於本月十八日、在虹橋飛機場、駕駛雙翼輕便教練機、表演各種飛行技術、頗得各界稱譽、裴氏復於昨日下午四時、在外灘華懋飯店八樓客廳、招待報界茶會、暢談各種航空事業、到有中西各報社記者二十餘人、兹將所談各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>希望中國發展航空</h3>
<p>裴氏首稱、意國政府及人民對中國頗表同情、當余在意大利時、曾先後與三省剿匪副司令張學良等氏談話、深感中國前途希望極大、迨至本人此次來華觀察、見中國最高官吏、一切行動、均利用飛機往返、足表現當局正在積極提倡發展航空事業、中國地大物博、對民用航空、亟應從事發展、至中國在此時發展航空事業、將更便利、蓋年來歐美等國對航空事業頗形發達、其一切發展、均有詳密之計劃、足供中國採用而實行之、更希望中國對駕駛人材、積極造就、以資普遍、</p>
<h3>歐美各國航空發達</h3>
<p>裴氏復謂、意大利航空事業、自歐戰以後、因受戰後呼種影響、幾將落伍、嗣經首相墨索里尼集中各方力量、積極從事發展、不但恢復原狀、且較前益形進步、至其所用飛機、凡行程已經超過二千小時以後、則將該機重行拆造、故其飛行益臻安全、再本人曾先後赴各國参觀各該國飛機廠、覺各國航空事業、莫不突飛猛進、尤以俄國機廠、規模宏大、爲各國冠、其生産力亦甚宏大、</p>
<h3>準備晋京拜會當局</h3>
<p>裴氏繼謂、本人當來華以後、曾一度赴杭、晋謁蔣委員長、但全係拜會性質、對發展航空等問題、並未提及、最近據財政部長孔祥熙氏轉告、蔣委員長擬與本人再度會晤、對航空事業、作一具體商談、本人亦擬於最近期内、赴京一行、拜會政府各當局、並擬前往北平遊歷一次、</p>
<h3>離滬前將再度表演</h3>
<p>裴氏末謂、此次來華、承各界歡迎、頗爲榮幸、前次在虹橋表演、復承各界及各報贊譽、尤爲感謝、本人不久將行返國、但於一月或二月後·再行來華、蓋本人此次來華、最愉快者、未及匝月、得有華友很多、深爲欣幸、惟本人爲酬答各界盛意及普遍提倡航空起見、决於離滬返國前、定期再行表演一次云云、</p>
<h3>英國向意購夜行機</h3>
<p>裴氏報告畢、有人詢以據聞中國最近曾向意大利訂購大批飛機、爲發展民用航空之用、但未識此說可確否、裴氏當答、此說并非事實、惟悉中國最近向意國購有夜行機一架、聞其價、約值意金七千元云云、</p>
<h3>新英使將到滬</h3>
<p>外部派李迪俊來滬歡迎</p>
<p>英國駐華新使開度甘氏、業偕隨員五人、由英乘大英輪船公司芝打路號輪來華履新、昨晨據該公司消息、該輪已於前晚抵達香港、昨日下午、由港啓椗來滬、二十六日晨七時可抵滬、輪泊公和祥碼頭、該國駐華代辦殷格蘭氏、亦已於昨晨由平抵滬歡迎、並悉我國外交部派該部情報司長李迪俊氏、定於今晚出京、來滬迎接、本市市長吳鐵城氏及外交部駐滬辦事處處長余銘等、業已預備專輪、屆時前往歡迎、</p>
<h3>比使今夜可到</h3>
<p>明午招待中外各界追悼比王</p>
<p>駐華比利時公使紀佑穆氏、因比王亚爾培一世逝世、曾於前午（二十二日）在北平招待中外各國領袖、開會追悼、事畢後即於昨日偕夫人離平、乘平滬通車來滬、准今晚十一時許抵埠、明日上午十一時半、即將在法租界天主教堂内招待本埠中外各機關代表、舉行追悼會、爲比王祈禱、聞該使在滬事畢後、准下月二日抵京、三日在首都招待中外各要人、作同樣之舉動、爲比王追悼云、</p>
<h3>日使有吉昨晨返滬</h3>
<p>日總領等均往歡迎</p>
<p>有吉决定回國一行</p>
<p>日本駐華公使有吉明、於本星期二由滬晋京、拜謁行政院長兼外交部長汪精衛、業已公畢、於昨晨七時半許、偕同参贊有野·秘書堀内·等由京乘搭夜快車返滬、當時駐滬日總領等均往北站歡迎、有吉公使下車後、即逕返畢勛路私邸休息、據聞有吉明决定返國一行、向該國外務省報告并請示、惟啓程日期、尚未確定云、</p>
<h3>孔祥熙到滬後重要談話</h3>
<p>美國提高銀價個人未便發表意見</p>
<p>銀團發行證劵應在合同範圍以内</p>
<p>行政院副院長兼財政部部長孔祥熙氏、前晚十一時乘坐夜車離京來滬、昨晨七時半抵此、逕返西愛咸斯路私邸休息、旋爲上午十一時、接見各報社記者、午刻前往中央銀行辦公、兹將孔氏之談話、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>美國提高銀價問題</h3>
<p>美國行將　實行提高銀價、我國政府及銀行界對此頗爲重視、孔氏接見記者之時、即以此項問題爲談話之中心、記者首詢孔氏對於美國提高銀價之意見、據孔氏談、中央對於美國提高銀價問題、頗爲重視、目前正在研究中、在中央之意見尚未决定以前、本人處於財長之地位、未便發表任何意見、至於本人個人對於此項問題之意見、亦不願有所發表、蓋恐引起市場之騷動也、記者旋詢孔氏以中央對於暫緩批准八國白銀恊定及禁止現銀出口之意見如何、孔氏答以上海銀行界請求暫緩批准八國白銀恊定、中央正在考慮之中、至於將來是否禁止現銀出口、一時尚談不到、最後、記者固請孔氏發表個人對於上海銀行界反對美國提高銀價之意見、孔氏乃笑謂、本人即以個人地位、亦不便有所表示、蓋銀行界此種主張、爲發表該會一方面之意見、在政府政策未宣布以前、本人實不便表示贊否也、</p>
<h3>上海銀團發行證劵</h3>
<p>財部前以　意國退還之庚欵爲擔保、向中央中國交通等　十六家銀行所組織之銀團借欵四千四百萬元、該銀團現决以此項借欵爲擔保、發行證劵三千萬元、昨晨記者晤及孔氏之時、曾詢以財部對於此舉已否同意、孔氏答以上海銀團發行證劵、如在借欵合同範圍以内辦理、自無不可云、</p>
<h3>棉麥借欵修改合同</h3>
<p>記者復詢孔氏　以美國棉麥　借欵合同取銷或修改之究竟、孔氏謂、已經運到之美棉麥、因國内市塲滯銷、當不能再照原定額數、繼續購進、而原定合同、則勢必修改、刻正由在美負責此事之魏文彬君、向美方進行磋商修改、至如何修改、現已進行至何種程度、美方既未發表、我方暫時亦不便表示、俟至相當時期、當可公佈、</p>
<h3>各方商榷提高銀價</h3>
<p>銀行界領袖昨訪孔磋商</p>
<p>駐華美商會昨開會討論</p>
<p>美政府實行提高銀價、本埠銀行業、於二十日電羅斯福、表示抗議後、羅氏尚未有覆電表示、昨日本市駐華美商會、亦開緊急會、表示態度、財長孔祥熙氏、昨晨到滬後、銀行界領袖於下午往訪、將有重要磋商、兹將各方消息、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>滬銀行界觀察</h3>
<p>新聲社云、自美國總統羅斯福爲提高産銀價格及剌激各用銀國家增加購買力以增進對外輸出起見、將施行重鑄銀幣、以提高銀價之政策、本埠銀行界認此舉於我國經濟地位、深爲不利、已於二十日電請羅斯福考慮、並請財部暫緩批准銀恊定、迄昨晚止、兩電尚未得答覆、新聲社記者、昨日分訪銀行界各要人、據彼等觀察、美國提高銀價之政策、其主要目的、在提高其本國産銀之價格、及推行復興計劃、並剌激一般用銀産銀國家、增進其購買力、能否因我國一紙電文之表示、而有所變更、其可能率殊小、雖有人謂银價提高後、外債賠欵之償付額、可以减少、及購進開發富源等必要工具、如機器等類之力量、可以增加、於我國未嘗無利、然與貿易上之損失相較、實甚微小、將來我國爲防止現銀流出過鉅、勢必徵收白銀出品稅、以資補救云、兹誌民國二十二年中央財政出納之有關金銀比價各欵目數字於後、以示銀價高漲之損益、</p>
<h3>銀貴關稅减少</h3>
<p>中央財政歲入科目中、與金銀比例價有關者、惟關稅一種、而關稅徵收單位之關金、爲一種與各金本位幣作一比例標凖之虚金本位、共每年收入之多寡、與金銀比價有重大關係、如民國二十二年概算中、關稅收入爲三萬五千四百六十五萬七千餘元、佔全部歲入百分之五十二强、倘銀價提高、則由關金申折之數减、而收入額即相對而减少、</p>
<h3>債務外交支出</h3>
<p>中央財政之歲出科目中、與金銀比價有關者、一爲債務費、二爲外交費中之各國使領館經費、三爲教育費中之留學經費、據二十二年歲出概算、債務費共爲二萬四千一百八十四萬二千餘元、其中内債佔九千八百零六萬六千餘元、外交費總數共一千零六十六萬三千餘元、其中尚有外交部經費在内、姑認爲全數均駐外使領館費、與債務費併計、不過一萬五千萬餘元、與關稅收之三萬五千餘萬比較、相差已逾二倍、至教育費中之留學費、則爲數甚少、故就中央財政情形言、銀價提高、亦未必有利、</p>
<h3>建設與輸入額</h3>
<p>再論可以購進機器、銀價高後、固可較廉、然我國歷年輸入貨品、大宗爲日用消耗品、而用以再事生産之工具原料等、則爲數甚微、此觀於歷年海關及國際貿易局報告可知、在金貴銀賤之時、我國新興工業、尚不能與外國貨競爭、倘銀價提高、外貨價格低廉、源源傾銷、國入經營之工商業、勢必完全破産、復何用購進再事生産之工具、至時資力已竭、何能再高談建設、故銀價提高、此時終覺得不償失也、</p>
<h3>銀行界昨訪孔</h3>
<p>據申時社記者探悉、聞本市銀行業主要領袖、於昨晨財孔來滬後、於下午即訪謁孔氏對應付美銀政策事、有所商討、對緩簽銀恊定問題、聞政府决將從緩簽字、又另據銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏語記者、政府方面對緩簽銀恊定可望無問題、關於以外具體辦法、銀行公會尚未向政府交換意見、孔部長來滬、私人方面、或將有所商談云、</p>
<h3>錢永銘氏意見</h3>
<p>據四行儲蓄會經理錢永銘氏語申時社記者稱、美國議員中、對於銀價意見、亦分兩派、贊於銀價價提高者、多爲産銀區域議員、反對派代表、則爲非産銀各區兩派競爭甚烈、現既由産業派占勝、我國現銀鉅額流出、勢將不免、銀行公會電美表示反對、美總统迄未復電、將來如何對付、須視事態之推進而决定云、</p>
<h3>美商會昨開會</h3>
<p>廣東路三號美國駐華商會、昨日下午五時半、在福州路美國總會、召集緊急大會、討論美總統羅斯福氏提高銀價問題、當由會長費倫趣爲主席、到會員八十餘人、對於我國銀行公會致電羅氏、抗議提高銀價政策事、討論頗久、並擬長電致羅總統、貢獻意見、請予愼重處理、</p>
<h3>羅氏主張未變</h3>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>譯文釋疑</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>在報上，看見了貴國書館設了貴欄，我眞是說不出的快樂。我雖然不是貴圖書館的讀書會員，我雖然住在這樣閉塞的鄉間，但我很僥倖：我在讀申報時，我就可以揩油。於是，先生們啊，我拿起筆來寫這封信了。</p>
<p>無疑的，貴欄之創設，對於現在的中國文化運動上是值得讚美的，而且也是急須的啊！不過我覺得還有幾點意見：丨但或者這也只是「多餘」！</p>
<p>一，在討論科學理論時，要大膽的　　　　明確的指示問者。</p>
<p>二，在討論讀書方法或指示参考書　　　　籍時，亦望注意到「具體的運　　　　用」，切勿可流於抽象的套語　　　　。</p>
<p>三，篇幅擴大點。</p>
<p>下面，我寫出我的問題：丨</p>
<p>一，在「資本論」日譯本丨高學素之譯本，昭和七年改造社版丨原　　　　著者第二版序文十五頁上十五　　　　行第二句：（　　　現存　事　態　光明　　　　　　　　　　　　　如　見元　　　　　　）。在　　　　别的論辯證法的中譯本中，則　　　　多譯爲「混淆現實」，僅有一人　　　　曾譯爲：辯護現有（大意如此　　　　，請看王靈臯譯黑格蘭「歷史　　　　哲學綱要譯者序言」。我不懂　　　　德文，究竟這句原意怎樣，不得知，請先生們解析一下。</p>
<p>二，黑格爾的「邏輯科學」可有中譯本？最近在報上登着廣告的周　　　　谷城先生的「邏輯大綱」可是其　　　　全譯，定價多少？</p>
<p>三，「小邏輯」是否是「哲學的科學大全一的别名？好了，下次再來！</p>
<p>最後，我必須說「我」。我是一個年未及冠的職業學校將要出校的學生，對於社會科學我是很有趣味，我希望時常能得到先生們的指導。（鄧保夫）</p>
<p>來信中關於建議的部分答覆於後：</p>
<p>一，在原則上完全同意：但也只能做到我們能力和「事實的可能」的範圍以内。</p>
<p>二，「讀書問答」欄只是本部工作的一部分，即關於一般讀書問題的討論，凡一切便於個别答覆的概不插入，所以有些人說我們談得太一般了，頗有不具體之嫌，其實這祗看到一部分。自然，就是在討論一般問題時，我們也當力避完全抽象的空談。</p>
<p>三，「讀書問答」攔能否再擴大一層，這是要看我們工作的開展方能决定。　　以下答覆你所詢問的幾項擬點。</p>
<p>一，關於資本論之一句：『曾　　現存　事態　光明　　　　　　　　如　見元　　　　　　』德文手頭没有。據Samuel　Moore　and　Aveling的英譯本（此英譯本極可靠）相當於這一句的句子作…Because　it　seemed　to　transtigure　and　to　glorify　the　existingstate　of　things…應譯作『因爲它（指採取着神秘化了的辯證法，即黑格爾的辯證法）看來彷彿使現存的事物美化和光明化了。』而從理論上說也須這樣才與上下文相稱。譯作『辯護……』已不大恰當，如果譯作『混淆……』，那簡直不可通了。</p>
<p>二，「小邏輯」是「哲學的科學大全」之一部分，這是對於黑格爾的「大邏輯」而言。周譯未看過。從他所定譯名看來當是「小邏輯」，是否全譯未詳。黑氏「邏輯科學」（即大邏輯）我們尚未看到中譯本。</p>

<h3>六局</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>蘇州婚喪慶弔時，有所謂六局者，乃爲不可或缺之執役，蓋若輩專業以謀生也。考之宋吳自牧夢梁錄四司六局筵會假貨條云：</p>
<p>「果子周掌簇飣盤看果，時新水果，南北京果，海臘肥脯醬切，像生花果，勸酒品件。蜜煎局掌簇飣看盤果套，山子蜜煎，像生窠兒。菜蔬局掌筵上簇飣看盤，菜蔬供筵，泛供異品菜蔬，時新品味，糟藏，像生件段等。油燭局掌燈火照耀，上燭，修燭，點照壓燈，辦席立臺，手把豆臺，竹籠燈豪，裝火簇炭。番藥局掌管龍涎沉腦，清和清福異香，香壘香爐香毬，裝香簇燼細灰効事，聽候換香，酒後素喚異品醒酒湯藥餅兒。排辦局掌椅桌交椅，桌凳書桌，及灑掃打　，拭抹供過之職。」</p>
<p>今之六局，頗有變更，果子蜜煎有店舖可購。菜蔬歸菜館供應。油燭局香藥局所掌，大概屬諸茶擔，排辦局所掌，屬諸轎班。故雖云六局，已非完全舊制。惟今之所有者，往往爲昔之所無，如樂部，砲乎，以及外執事（掮族牌傘屬者）等。然夢梁錄尚有四司，一爲帳設司，一爲茶酒司，一爲廚司，一爲臺盤司，今日有習用者。蓋四司六局，相沿數百年，或存或廢，或併或兼，乃有舊稱而非舊制矣。　　六局人品既雜，而需素詐欺，無所不至，若非内行，必大喫虧。於是賬房乃成六局之領袖，主家贛以指揮開發，則又與夢梁錄所云：「指揮局分，立可辦集，皆能如儀。」「祇直慣熟，不致失節，省主者之勞也。」相合矣。</p>
<p>此外尚有一特别之組織，名轎盤頭，有地段方位，各不侵越，凡嫁女送妝奩，非經若輩手不可。於是任意索價，駭人聽聞，論值多於婚前一日由執柯者代表乾宅主持，若執柯者口軟心慈，不臨市面，鮮有不大受竹槓之敲者。余友娶婦，估妝奩（指器皿）所值，不逾三百金，而轎盤頭得犒爲一百二十元。王引才長市時，曾有廢除之議，卒以若單生計攸歸，恐失業後更爲社會之蠧，未敢遂行。然究爲陋習，不廢使主婚者大受厥累也。</p>
<h3>證婚與監誓</h3>
<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>一對新人在富麗的禮堂中結婚，除諸親百友來参加之外，又必請一比新人地位高些的人來證婚，而且對新人致訓辭，訓他們相敬相愛，祝他們百年偕老·好像這個結婚，一定要證婚人之一證，才眞個可以合到老了·什麽部長局長委員等在莊嚴的禮堂中宣誓就職，也除同寅屬員以及來賓之参加外，必由其上級機關的上官或派員到場監誓，而且對他們致訓辭·也好像這就職者對在天之總理的誓言，一定要監誓者在場聽入了耳，才足證明，才足保證他們將來必能實行。</p>
<p>其實，處處時時都有鐵般的事實來證明這證婚與監誓之效用同樣遭遇失敗了·證婚是新式婚姻中之産物，而頻年來離婚新聞也就佔據了報紙的大篇幅，離婚案件是律師們之大宗生意，是法官的大繁雜事情·這許多的離婚者，他們結婚時都請過證婚人，甚至證婚人之祝辭猶在他們之耳而竟離婚了·證婚有什麽效用呢？監誓也是新時代的産物·一般叛黨叛國以及貪官污吏，他們在監誓者監着就職之時，所宣之誓，何等入耳，監誓者之訓辭，他們更誠意接受，然而他們於監誓者之訓辭猶在耳中，宣誓也在監誓者之耳，就胡作胡爲了，監誓又有什麽效用呢？</p>
<p>證婚人於證婚後，也就算一件工作完畢，他們的一切都不問了·監誓者於監誓後，也算一件工作完畢他們的一切都不問了·證婚與監誓，既祇爲結婚與宣誓時之像煞鄭重而實際無補於後來之一切，所以我想在這裏提議把證婚一件事取消了罷？監誓應怎樣？則事關黨國，不敢胡說。</p>
<h3>查三爺的故事</h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>查三爺，名小山，在清季要算是一個最豪富的人了；同時，吳門的沙三爺，正也是同樣的一個富翁。有一天，查三爺遊至吳門，就請沙三爺喝酒，席間肴饌的豐美，眞是無可論比；後來沙三爺要略盡地主之誼，請還查三爺；但想來想去，缺乏幾個出名的廚子，因此就差人到查三爺那裏去向他告偕；查就派了五十名廚子到沙家來替他辦置酒筵；沙家的門房一看，有許多廚子，覺得非常奇怪，連忙進去禀知主人，主人親自走進廚房一看，只見掌燒鴨的，掌燒猪的，做䬪飪的，洗凈菜蔬水菓的，已足足的佔了四十六人；而主事烹飪的，也不過四人而已。沙三爺心裏一想自己的廚房太狹小了，非但廚子們很不方便，就是自己臉上，也不甚體面；因此就費了三天功夫，招了幾十個匠人，把廚房拓大；然後設酒席，發請帖，謂查三爺來；查三爺來到之後，沙三爺謙讓的說：「怱怱辦來，恐怕不能適口罷」一查三爺聽了，笑着說：</p>
<p>「從前我每次出門的時候，單廚子總要帶上一百二十人，後來恰逢聖駕南巡，所以减去了四十人，現在跟我的僅有八十人了！到了這裏，又蒙君告借，除了三十人自用外，僅遣五十人前來，眞的！人數又少，時間又侷促，反恐怕不能如你做主人的意了！」說罷相與大笑。</p>
<p>又有一次，查三爺走到某骨董店，一脚剛跨進門口，忽聽得掛在簷上籠裏的八哥在呌着：「查三老爺來了！查三老爺來了！」查三爺心裏，覺得非常喜歡。過了幾天，查三爺又到店裏去，八哥又呌起來了；查三爺心裏着實喜歡牠，就問店主人要賣多少錢？店主人裝着驚惶的態度說：「這八哥是朋友寄在這裏的，並不是小店裏的東西，」否則即以此相贈，何必要說賣與不賣「呢」，查三爺就喚店主人去問他朋友·要賣多少錢。店主人去了好些時候，回來說：「友人不願出賣。」查三爺命他再去與他的朋友商量，但仍是不肯。查三爺發怒道：「這八哥無論要賣多少錢，我都願意」。於是店主人假裝又去了一次，然後說：「非紋銀一百兩不賣。」查三爺聽了之後·早把一百兩銀子擲了下來，帶着八哥走了。</p>
<p>查三爺懷着喜悅的心情，提着八哥回家；那知過了幾天之後，方知用了一百兩銀子換來的八哥，只會呌一查三老爺來了！」别的話，一句也不會說。查三爺事後恩之，才知道受了店主人的欺騙。</p>

<p>自强笑道：我完全聽你的話，你說怎麽樣的我就怎麽樣？桂枝笑道：我聽到你也常常唱戲呢。要不，咱們兩個人，合唱一段罷。自强笑道：我這個唱，是六月天學的，拿出來有點兒臭，不過你這樣子說着，我不能不唱，我要不唱，辜負了你那一番好意。桂枝笑道：你唱我聽，我唱你聽，好不好，有什麽關係？自强笑道：對了，那麽，我來唱一段武家坡罷。桂枝笑道：你應該唱汾河灣才對，將來打平了小鬼，回來做平遼王。自强順手牽了他到床上，兩人並排坐着，手拍了他的肩膀道：你這話不對，難道我還能把你當柳迎春那樣疑心不成？桂枝笑道：你唱武家坡，也不是把我當王寳釧嗎？自强道：我是隨便說的，並没有用意，桂枝笑道：這不結了，我今天用心是用心，也不能處處都用心。這話又說回來了，就是用心，也只希望你一個人得着好處，我們隨便。有道是一人有福，牽起了一屋，你不知道我現在一顆心，完全都加在你一個人身上嗎？說着這話時，身子一歪，倒在自强的懷裹。自强緊緊的摟住了他，將下巴頦擱在他肩上，低聲道：你這樣的說了我怎捨得離開了呢？桂枝；開了他，突然站起來道：我去作麵你吃，要不然，回頭爐子裏火没有了。說着打開房門，走了出去。自强見桂枝今晚上處處的體貼着，可是又不願體貼過了分，以至於自己留戀難走。於是背了兩手，在屋子裏走來走去，揣想着桂枝的態度。（三二○）</p>

<h3>說眞空</h3>
<p>— 程範羣</p>
<p>眞空管的種類很多，凡是密封的玻璃管，中間有幾個電極（Electrode）；並且管内的空氣抽得很稀薄，或換置他種氣壓極低的氣體的，如Ｘ光管，水銀弧光燈，整流管，光電管，該斯勒管（Geissler　Tube），及無綫電用眞空管等，都總稱爲眞空管。</p>
<p>眞空管裏面除去了電極以外，是不是空無所有呢，實際上縱然把管裏的氣壓；抽到大氣壓力的百萬分之一，但是管裏仍舊有億兆個氣體分子。</p>
<p>在解釋眞空的物理的觀念以前，先說氣體的結構。在攝氏２０度及７６０耗水銀柱的大氣壓力之下，每立方　的氣體約有２.５２ＸＩ０Ｉ９個分子。現在拿氫做例子，來說明在上述情形之下，墊原子所佔據空間地位。因爲墊原子的直徑約爲_８種，所以實際上氫的本質僅佔據了一立方　的一百萬分之一。這數值雖然不很精密，但是總可以說：縱然在大氣壓力之下，氣體的分子間，是有很多的空隙的。如果氣體所受的壓力减小，那麽分子間的空隙更加增大。平常所謂眞空，是指一密封器中的氣體的壓力减至極小而已！</p>
<p>假使氣管内氣體壓力减低至大氣壓力的百萬分之一，這樣的眞空可以說是很高，因爲這壓力相當於0.00076耗水銀柱，或0.0987「罷」（罷的定義見附註）。這時氫氣的本質，約佔據空間的百萬分之一的百萬分之一的地位。所以從這一點看來，這樣的眞空程度確是高極了。</p>
<p>但是從另一方面來說。在這0.987「罷」壓力之下的任何氣體，每立方　仍舊有2.52X　Ｉ０　Ｉ３個分子，或者說每立方耗，就有2_５２Ｘ　Ｉ００個分子。所以空間還充滿了氣體的分子的。</p>
<p>其實無綫電用眞空管，是利用熱電子的放射現象，應當呌做熱電子管，才覺確當。（見黄鑑材著無綫電讀本第四十三頁及四十四頁）</p>
<p>附註　一「罷」（Ｂar）爲科方糧有一達因（Dyne）的壓力，一「罷」相當於1.0133的大ＸＩ０—６氣壓力。</p>
<h3>三極雙孿管</h3>
<p>— 王孟澂</p>
<p>以二座三極管，並裝於一個燈泡裏面，呌做三極雙孿管（Triple　Twin　Tube）。管内共有七極，如附圖所示，左邊三極管與輸入電路相接，呌做輸入部分；右邊三極管與輸出電路相接，呌做輸出部分。二個燈絲，在管内彼此並聯，用一個Ａ組電池，供給燈絲電流，惟輸入部分之燈絲，間接供給熱量，使陰極受熱，發射電子，這個陰極，在眞空管裏面直接與輸出部分之栅極相接。輸出部分不裝陰極，電子由燈絲直接發射。</p>
<p>美國製造的三極雙孿管，有２９５式交流管，２９１式直流管和２９３式汽車内收音機用的數種。根據實騐，這種三極雙孿管與五極管相比較，以同一屏電壓，輸出方面，可得二倍大的成音電工率，而靈敏度之優越，則可增至三倍以上，功效之大，由此可知。</p>
<p>輸入電壓之接於强力放大管者，最大之值，常以栅路内所接之負電壓爲限，過此限度，栅路的總阻减低，發生栅流，至ＩＰ—Ｅg特性由綫之正栅電壓部分，屏路輸出，即成失眞，惟於三極雙孿管，ＩＰ—Ｅg特性曲綫之正負栅電壓二部分，均能利用，栅路總阻，仍爲極高，屏路輸出，失眞很微。故在同樣荷負之下，得使失眞最小，輸出最大。</p>
<p>各種多次週率之接於三極雙孿管者，以二次週率之失眞爲最著，三次週率以上，失眞微小，不易覺察。若以三極雙孿管接成推挽式電路而運用之，二次週率之失眞，可以完全免除。公共塲所和電影院裏，極大而不失眞的成音電工率的輸出，最爲重要　利用三極雙孿管，不但可以省去許多級之成音放大，且音質自然，失眞最小。</p>
<h3>眞空管之製造</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>眞空管内部之各種零件，尺寸大小均須非常精確，質料非常純粹，其所用度量，常須以微至在數千分之一吋以下計算，例如絲極上所塗之放射衣之重量，有小至千萬分之二十一磅者。凡此各種零件，均須經過化學試騐之精密測定始可應用。</p>
<p>零件既備之後，繼之爲製造玻璃心子。標準長度之玻璃管，不斷籍機器移入漸漸增强之瓦斯火燄，待玻璃管下端受熱柔軟如溶蠟，然後以一旋轉之圓錐形模子使其邊緣，成喇叭狀，再入另一火燄，而切去所不需要之部份。各極之導綫與支柱即插於此心子之中，加以高熱，在金屬模型内緊壓，使之互相溶合。在此心子温度未退之前，以壓縮空氣在抽氣管中吹成一孔，以備抽氣之用。</p>
<p>經過精密檢騐之後，即爲裝配另件如屏，栅，絲，陰極，簾栅與陰栅等矣。此等另件，係籍自動機器裝配銲接，其速度誠足使吾人，目爲之眩也。在上述各種另件之外，尚有一置鎂粒之小杯，最後接於栅極支柱之上。</p>
<p>零件裝置完竣，重經檢騐之後，即送交封管機。眞空管之玻罩與心子在火燄之中接合以後，乃連於抽氣機中抽去空氣。在抽氣之時，同時以有力之高週率電流於各主要金部份加以强烈温度，使眞空管中玻璃及金屬物所含之氣體亦得以抽去。抽氣將畢之際，乃使鎂粒爆發或化成烟霧。此種烟霧能吸收殘餘之有害氣體而在玻璃罩内部凝成銀色薄膜以保持眞空之壽命，抽氣完畢，眞空管即自動封閉。</p>
<p>然後將眞空管之各極導綫插入各插脚之中，在焙爐上使黏合眞空管與管座及管頂金屬承帽之膠灰烘乾，切去露出插脚外之導綫，銲以銲錫，於是眞空管成矣。</p>
<h3>眞空管特性速求法</h3>
<p>眞空管的特性雖多，但是常用的不外下述三種：</p>
<p>一，放大係數（Amplifrcation　Factor）變換等量屏流所需要之屏電壓數值（ＥＰ）與栅電壓數舉（Ｅg）之比率，稱謂眞空管之放大係數　即放大係數Ｕ等於△ＥＰ／△ＥＧ。</p>
<p>二，屏阻（Plate　Resistance）變動小量屏壓（ＥＰ）與所得相當屏流（ＩＰ）變值之之比率，即爲眞空管之屏阻，換言之；屏阻ＲＰ等於△ＥＰ／△ＩＰ單位爲歐姆。（通常所謂屏阻均指屏路交流電阻而言直流電阻不常用及）</p>
<p>三，互導（Mutual　Conductance）互導乃表示栅電壓變值（ＥＧ）與屏流變值（ＩＰ）之比率，即互導ＩＭ等△ＩＰ／△ＥＧ　　單位爲漠，（Mho）實用單位爲兆分漠。（Micromho）</p>
<p>找尋眞空管特性的方法，固然很多，但是多非借重精巧的儀器而繁複的算式不可。本篇所介紹的方法，是根據了上述的定義而着想的，既不需精密的儀器，又無需繁複的算式，極合一般業餘家個人試騐之用。</p>
<p>如圖Ｔ爲ＯＩＡ眞空管，先將燈絲電壓調整至規定數舉５Ｖ.，假定屏壓爲１３５Ｖ.栅壓爲９Ｖ.時，屏流爲３ma。次將栅壓减至６Ｖ.，（屏壓及燈絲電壓均不動）設此時屏壓增至６ma再將栅壓回原，（仍爲９Ｖ.。）將屏壓加高至適得屏流６ma時爲止，設此時屏壓爲Ｉ６０Ｖ.按上述等一條定義得：</p>
<p>次求屏阻，如上法，設栅壓爲９Ｖ.</p>
<p>屏壓爲１３５V.時，屏流爲３m2o今將屏壓加至１４０Ｖ.後，屏流如增至３５ma，則依上述第二條定義，得：</p>
<p>即一oIA.眞空管在屏極１３５—１４０Ｖ.栅極９Ｖ.時之電阻爲１００００歐姆。</p>
<p>（注意：所謂屏阻，必須附帶說明眞空管在某種情形下所測到的，如單說屏阻爲一萬歐姆，即屬毫無意義。）</p>
<p>再次求互導，仍如上法，設屏壓爲１３５Ｖ.栅壓爲９Ｖ.時，屏流爲３mao將栅壓减至７.5Ｖ.時，屏流如增至４.2ma，則依上述第三條定義，得：</p>
<p>如言互導，也須附帶說明眞空管在試騐時的情形，因爲牠是隨着屏阻，屏流而變換的。如上述，—oIA眞空管在屏壓１３５Ｖ.栅壓９Ｖ._7Ｖ.時之互導爲八百兆分漠。</p>
<h3>交流管與直流管之異同</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>眞空管因燈絲電源之不同，可分爲交流管及直流管二種，然而其一切檢波放大調幅振盪之作用兩式固無分别也。眞空管之以蓄電池或乾電池燃點燈絲者統稱爲直流眞空管，因電池携帶充電之不便，吾人隨思以交流電應用。但直流管應用交流後雖有中心電阻其交流香亦不能完全避免，因創有特殊設備之交流管。交流管普通用低壓燃燈絲，現在亦有用數十伏脫之交流電壓者。然大都均爲二·五伏脫。直流管則爲一·一·二·三·三，五及六·三伏脫等。但因燈絲電源供給之不便其趨勢恒採用省電式，燃點燈絲之電流不大，故燈絲以塗有　化物者爲多，以較塗以釷層者在同一電子蒸發數之下可省不少電力也。交流管則反是，絲極電流常在一安培以上。若干眞空管如七一，一○等因燃點燈絲至充分發射電子之温度需時較長之故亦可用於交流電。此種交直流眞空管當用交流燃點燈絲時其栅極負壓常較用直流時稍高。交流管爲避免交流營營之聲，製造時常採用傍熱式。所謂傍熱式也者，即給熱物並不同時發射電子也。給熱物即爲燈絲通以電源，但不與無線電路發生直接關係。其外圍以瓷管，當燈絲通過電流發生熱效時，其熱度傳至瓷管，再由瓷管傳至附於瓷管外之金屬圓柱片，此金屬片間接受到燈絲之熱力後隨蒸發電子。交流管之屏極亦有用鎢編成之金屬網者如二七等類。眞空管之用交流電燃點者其壽命可較用直流時爲長，以其燈絲熱度平均也。交流管之負荷亦較直流管爲大，其他部份兩式均相同，但交流管可用直流燃點，不過耗電較多，而直流管用交流燃點時，以營營之聲不能避免殊不適用。</p>
<h3>世界最古之眞空管</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>距今五十年前，世界發明怪傑愛迪生氏發現當電燈泡之燈絲熾熱時。若其旁置一金屬小屏，則燈絲與此屏間有電流通過。此種現象，即現用眞空管之所依據。當時愛迪生爲作更進一步之試騐起見，特製此種多一金屬小片之電燈泡多只。用炭化之竹絲爲燈絲，燈絲二旁名植立金屬細絲一段爲小屏；絲與屏同固封於抽成眞空之玻璃泡内，此種特别之電燈泡，可謂世羃最古之眞空管。</p>
<p>去年美國國家廣播公司（ＮationalBroadcasting　Co.）特取此種愛氏當日所制之特虽電燈泡，裝成無線電收音機一个。其綫路如圖，以一百十伏脫之直流電燃點燈絲。製成後，用以收取ＷＪＺ電之播音，而將其收得之音輸入ＷＥＡＦ電台，由ＷＥＡＦ電臺再行播送，以供各界人仕收聽。據當時收聽者去：「經如此轉播之音，仍極優美，可與原來ＷＥＡＦ電臺之播音相彷。」</p>
<p>如此則二極眞空管之發明非始於一九○四年，亦非由弗蘭敏氏發明之；而其發明期實遠在五十年前，其發明者實爲怪傑愛迪生氏，特愛氏當時未知此特别電燈泡尚有此特别之作用耳。</p>
<h3>廢眞空管復活與使用</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>燒毁眞空管的確是業餘研究家最掃興底一會事，倘然燈絲没有燒斷，電子飛射的効能已失去了，或燈絲燒斷間的距離不遠，這或許還有一綫希望，用種種方法使它復活，該項復活法在本刊已有介紹過了，毋須再贅。</p>
<p>假使燒斷的燈絲已不在原有地位，或燒斷間的距離太遠，非上項方法所能復活者，那末豈非成了廢眞空管嗎？現在鄙人來介紹一種簡便的復活法，使廢了的眞空管再行復活，那末在研究家的經濟損失方面，可以挽回不少矣！</p>
<p>先將燈絲燒斷的眞空管照（圖一）接好，用手指在眞空管的外面輕輕的彈幾下，至聽筒内聞到一種「搭」的一聲爲止，這時斷了的燈絲是已和栅極路（Ｇ）道通矣！再照（圖二）接上乾電池，視燈絲是否明亮，然後用酒精燈在眞空管的外週燒着，至玻璃發現微紅爲度，待冷透後.斷燈絲已和栅極路（Ｇ）熔合，用以作（二極）整流管接法見（圖三）効力和工作與二極眞空管無黑，其不同點則不過絲極電壓（ＦＦ）稍小而已。</p>

<h3>斜風細雨中老爺青白賽未終塲</h3>
<p>但見人仰馬翻而五體投地</p>
<p>昨日爲望平街老爺兵與漢口青白隊棒球塲相見之期、雖天氣甚佳、但惜時守信的老爺們、都趕於下午三時半到塲参加軍事會議、有妻子的老爺們、還帶着如花的美眷、活潑的愛子來做後盾、没有一個人肯做動員令下的落伍者、這很可以想見老爺們的是烈士暮年雄心未已了、老爺兵開過軍事會議商定攻守大計之後、便冒雨小試脚頭、靜待敵軍前來挑戰、到了三點四十分、霏霏小雨、雖越下越大、潘公展局長和沈回春先生都依然先後趕到、一個凖備開球、一個凖備執法、但以時間尚早、就都只好袖乎旁觀、</p>
<p>後來鐘鳴四下、老爺兵一切凖備已成、然漢口青白隊却没有一兵一卒到塲、大家知道青白隊大概是忘却前約的時間了、於是便分爲兩軍、聊事演習、兼過運動　、</p>
<p>老爺兵演習正酣、忽報敵人殺到、大家凝神一看、原來青白隊已姗姗而來了、雖這時候已是四點三十分、超過比賽時間是達三十分之久、但在不知惜時不能守信的人們看來總也不發生什麽問題罷、但青白隊既趕到又人馬不齊、只得向老爺隊借兵、於是人才濟濟的老爺隊便把四員大將借給青白、開始列陣作戰、</p>
<p>這時斜風細雨包圍棒球塲、兩軍便在潘公展局長順風開球沈回春先生冒雨執法之下交了砲火、可是不幸得很、肉搏不久、風雨愈大、而且滿地泥濘、不宜奔走、不是這個跌得五體投地、便是那個跌得五岳朝天、人仰馬翻之下、簡直完全失去戰鬥力、執法如山的裁判員看到這種情形、便鳴金收兵、在兩軍各無勝負之下、結束這次友誼的比賽、</p>

<h3>南北文學及其他</h3>
<p>— 古明</p>
<p>幻想豐富，决定于晴朗而遼廓底天空，和幽森深鬱底暗夜；這便是宗教和文學之淵源。如果是極物質底民族，在風沙和艱窘裏，便不甚有宗教或文學。試考全世界偉大底宗教發源，皆在一種什麽地域和自然環境裏，便將驚奇許多自然勢力之偉大！</p>
<p>我們從來不聞新疆有偉大的文學，西藏出了世界闻名的作家。普通民間歌謠許有文學價值，然未必能比上荷馬。論文學似乎不應分南北，但照主觀情况論，是有畛域可分的。</p>
<p>近來爲了南方文學北方文學，京派海派，熱鬧過一時了。但無論或京或海，或驚或駭，雖爲一派，與文學終自縣殊。目前執筆者大抵爲南方人，將來在文學史上未必特標一題曰「北京文學」的。但許多雜人流到那方面去後，漸漸住入高樓，依倚權貴，前面又無競爭者，自然要飄飄然覺得不凡，而成爲那麽一派。上海乃洋奴，買辦，流氓之鄉，藏垢納污之地，非文學環境，是不必北京諸子才知道的。但倘有文學，也决不至名呌「流氓文學」。或則靠官而得名，或則爲商以爭利，二者俱譏，實無須爭着誰是「正統」的。</p>
<p>所以現在南方人物較北地爲多者、也無非自然環境的變遷。遠者文化南移，近者歐風東漸。西北原來是富庶之鄉，吳越皆斷髮文身之族。因爲人民使用着地力，不加培養，漸漸要地瘠民貧。森林既被用光，河流也漸改道，沃壤也變爲荒原。譬如四川的火井，燒上幾百年或千年，也要烟消火滅的。那麽趕生活容易的地方跑，所以南移。黄河流域的文化枯竭了，到了長江和珠江，這其間的生活更要困窘起來，文化更要衰落，則要弄到南入於海的。那時也許可以呌「海派」吧，然而，也就什麽没有了。</p>
<p>南方可算物産豐饒，山明水秀，所以現代還能有人才産生，專事作夢，專事理想，即算是吟風弄月，也還是在物質生活之有餘。如仍希望將來生出很大的文學天才，則請稍稍留心現代的物質環境。</p>
<h3>馬來人的家</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>星期日，一早便是烏陰天，吃過了早餐，太陽還没出來。悶在家里不知道怎麽好，就想邀幾個朋友出去逛逛。</p>
<p>五個人踏着四輛自由車。丨亚珍這小妮子怕氣力不够踏不來，要我載她去；路是平坦的，可是踏到第二座橋的時候，我已經落後了。</p>
<p>丨出力些，你瞧他們已經跑得那麽遠了。</p>
<p>她在背後拍着我的脊骨說。</p>
<p>汗水山泉似的從頭髮里直淌下來，淌到額角，淌到鼻子邊，又淌到脖子上。想抽出手帕揩一揩，但是一縮手車子翻到溝里來可不成；如果是我自家就好了，汗水不會流得那麽多，縮一會手是不致有什麽危險的。</p>
<p>過了橋，兩邊的景物換了樣子。起先是荒塚纍纍，野草長得半尺那麽高。再跑下去，漸漸地荒凉起來，路也没有柏油；沙和小石子在車輪下劈劈地嚮着。一些椰子樹不整齊地站在那里，有幾個小孩子背着一大串香蕉走過去。以後又經過一段種了烟葉的田，便進了「甘江」了。</p>
<p>他們在一家馬來人的屋子前面停下來，擺好車子站在那里等我。這家的主人我們是相熟的，他不時到市上來，買米買布都在亚珍的鋪子里。看見我們來了，他喜歡得全露出兩排白牙齒，一面牽起我的手表示他的熱烈歡迎。走進木板搭起來的屋子，一陣風從後門吹來，覺得凉爽了好多；主人知道我們口渴，呌他的妻子捧了兩隻椰子來。喝過鮮甜的椰水，她還送過一籃菓子。</p>
<p>屋子的陳設是簡單極了的。一張床，桌和椅子擺在中間。没有一幅畫或照片，也没有衣橱這些東西。兩個光着身子的孩子瞪着生疏的眼珠子，亚珍給了他們一個「紅毛丹」，丨這菓子的味道跟廣東的荔枝没有什麽分别。</p>
<p>丨爲什麽不穿衣服呢？</p>
<p>一個朋友問着。</p>
<p>丨他們不肯穿。</p>
<p>丨天天這樣子麽？</p>
<p>丨是的，睡覺也是光着身咧。</p>
<p>他們的兒子就那麽强健，一年到頭不生病，下雨的時候，最多也不過穿件單衫就够了。</p>
<p>馬來人的生活是簡單的，原始的。我們在那里玩到中午，主人的妻已經把飯弄好了；白飯里加了辣椒和魚干就請了一次客。生長在馬來國土里的我們自然吃得很好，一個從中國來了不久的朋友却爲難了：只有他用湯匙吃，我國全都用手抓飯的。</p>
<p>玩了半天，太陽不曉得在什麽時候偷偷的溜了出來。回去的時候，我的車上載了兩隻大榴槤，亚珍讓給後邊的朋友去了。</p>
<h3>心底譴責</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>這幾天來我更加容易生氣了，可憐的莉做了我的出氣筒。她剛才和我閙了一塲後，氣憤憤的跑掉了。當地恨恨地關門的一刹那，我很想追上去將她拉住，雙手抱着她的腰用求饒的眼光望着她，用温柔的聲音對她說：『莉姐，原諒我吧，剛才我是發小孩脾氣，你如果眞要出去，就帶我一同去吧！』然而不知爲什麽我的兩脚像被釘子釘着一般走不動，連眼睛也像被黑布紥住了一般没有望到地，聽到樓下一聲重重的關門聲丨丨比剛才在我這里關的還要響，我知道她含着無限的冤屈走了。</p>
<p>涙珠像噴泉一般從眼眶内滖了出來，我奇怪自己爲什麽近來如此傷感，動不動就是掉涙，在以前如非用辣椒去剌激牠，是不容易流出來的。</p>
<p>呆呆地坐着，涙珠的光像水晶般透明，像冬天掛在樹梢上的冰條那樣清潔美麗，從這里我彷彿看到了臉上充滿了憤怒，悲哀的莉，她拖着孤獨的影子在十字街頭徘徊，在石山之上流涙，她一定不想回來了，唉！回來受我的氣，誰願意呢？</p>
<p>聽到噹噹噹的鐘聲，知道第一小時下課了，涙珠掉下最後一顆，李媽走了進來，我連忙裝出很鎭靜的樣子伏在桌上寫字。</p>
<p>我的心一陣緊似一陣的被壓迫得連呼吸都困難起來，我想大哭一塲，或者立刻去到人山人海的街道上去尋找莉去，即使找不到等到黄昏時我帶着失望和悲哀回來，總算自己報復了自己，自己代着　　罰　　　　是的　就這樣找　着沉重的肢步走下樓來，來到中山馬路了</p>
<p>男人，女人，小孩，老人甚至一根電燈柱，每輛停在路旁的洋車，都經過我的銳利的目光掃射，可是失望得很，穿淺灰布衣旗袍的雖然見到不少，但總找不到莉的影兒。</p>
<p>走了許多地方仍然找不到她，看警察崗位内的鐘已經四點半了。</p>
<p>也不知怎的，居然跑到什麽厦禾路開元路這一帶來了，這時我還没有絶望，我想她一定回去看到我留在桌上的條子了，她應該趕來的，如果我們在這里過到，我一定會張開兩臂不顧一切抱着她的。</p>
<p>幾輛笨重的貨車飛奔似的駛過，塵土撲進眼來，幾乎把我變成了瞎子。隨着脚步走去，莫明其妙，突然又來到了海邊。</p>
<p>找不着她！這時似乎完全絶望了，但是奇怪，我的心忽而像掉下一塊石頭似的輕鬆了許多，没有剛才的着急，也没有什麽悲哀，只是茫然地跳進了一只小划子，輕輕飄地來到了海的中央。</p>
<p>海水是碧綠的，雲是藍的，天的東北角上浮着幾朶棉絮似的潔白的雲，不整齊的洋樓在蔚藍的天幕下現得特别可憐而無聊。眞的，我將這些灰色的洋樓比成了燒給死人住的靈屋，好像裏面住着的人都是死屍一般，可不是嗎？整天在碼頭上大街上勞働着的人們，他們那里有這些房屋住，只有那些飽食終日，無所事事的活着的死屍才有高樓大厦住呵</p>
<p>因爲風不大，祇有微微的波濤，舟子搖得很慢，我似乎睡在兒時的搖籃裏一般舒服。細細地研究這幾天來的心情突變，是因耳鳴病加重，肺部又在作怪了，我不敢去醫院檢查，雖然醫生曾經再四叮嚀我無論如何每星期要去檢查一次，過磅一次，但我不敢去，爲的是怕他嚕哩嚕囌，說什麽休息，晒太陽，吃補品的話。</p>
<p>舟子間我去那里，我想用一句含有詩意的話回答他：『隨牠飄去吧！』然而我不會用厦門話說，即使說他也不懂的，只好用嘴吧向左邊動了一下，他就移轉方向了。</p>
<p>人生是空虚的，苦惱的，這時我更深刻地體會了此中的意味。雖然在艱苦的奮鬥中你可更把握着人生的意義，更可　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一到像現在一樣，什麽都没有了，心裏充滿着的是空虚的悲哀，人生的苦惱。</p>
<p>漸漸地我的頭重得不能抬起來了，而且前腦像用鐵錘撞着一般地痛，温暖的陽光照得我發昏，就這樣，小舟載着我漂流了一個半鐘頭，重新回到找不到莉的影子的街道來了。</p>
<p>莉，祝福你已平安歸來，受了心的譴責的我此時反而不願看見你了！</p>
<h3>鸕鶿</h3>
<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>舟輕悠悠地蕩出了鄱陽湖。過龍口後，映入眼簾的，便是數不清的漁筏。</p>
<p>筏都是用竹編成的，形式狹長，前端翹起。上面置有一只竹簍和一張矮凳。側首的竹竿上，立了好幾頭鸕鶿。</p>
<p>漁人只須把腰向前一彎，手中的篙子一點，竹筏便箭一般向前行去。在水面上輕輕地劃出兩條波紋。</p>
<p>漁筏成陣似的佈在水面。魚貫地，或雁翼地前進。</p>
<p>到了恰當的河面，漁人知道水内藏魚很多，便一聲呼嘯，大家把鸕鶿一齊趕入水中。</p>
<p>漁人口裏「盧！盧！」的喊着，鸕鶿也「甲！甲！」的和漁人的呼聲相應着。慢慢地散開來。</p>
<p>有的潑剌剌地在水上飛行；有的悠然地在水中游蕩。碧的眼，鈎的嘴。左右顧盼着。一瞥見魚影在前面閃過，馬上一個筋斗翻下水，追踪地捕去。碰着它的魚類，好像兔子遇見獵狗一樣。很少能安然逃遁的。</p>
<p>鸕鶿把魚捕住後，就昻起首；口裏含了魚，高興地游近主人的竹筏。於是主人從它口中把魚取出，朝竹簍内一抛；隨即另取一條細小的喂它。</p>
<p>食後，它又很高興地「甲！甲！」地呌着，划開去，仍復從事捕魚的工作。</p>
<p>這樣，最好的鸕鶿每天能捕幾十斤魚　　當天氣晴朗的時候，河水清碧見底，我們便可以坐在船頭，斜倚船篷，安閒地凝注水内。看鸕鶿追逐游魚的情形。目覩那弱者爲生存面挣扎的情形，心頭不禁有點凄戚之感。</p>
<p>可是鸕鶿雖這樣爲主人效力，自己却難得一飽。</p>
<p>有人說：這並不是主人不肯讓它吃：是因爲怕吃飽了懶得動，不再願意替主人捕魚。這，或許也有相當的道理。</p>
<h3>我詛咒你那麽一笑　（十）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>但一記起老劉剛才說的。</p>
<p>「這一晚，一個擺夷女人也没來哪！」</p>
<p>便安靜地睡下了，雖然那麽一付笑容曾使我不舒服了好些時候。</p>
<p>第二天早上，我在馬塲上，一面打掃馬糞，一面就從樹蔭疎處，向老劉的門前望去。糟糕透哪！昨夜在他店裏宿夜的擺夷女人，正一個一個地挑着竹筐，在門邊芒果樹蔭下，現了出來。大家沉默地走着，彷彿送葬的行列似地，已没有往日動身時應有的朝氣了。内中有兩個十六七歲的擺夷女子，則更是低低地垂着頭，軟弱無力地拖着足步，彷彿還留着夜來低泣的樣子。</p>
<p>我心裏很是難過，想着，希望着：昨夜該没有那麽一件不幸的事情發生吧！但願她今朝的不快，是由於女伴間少了嘴，駡了架，或是互相揪着頭髮，打過來的。</p>
<p>然而，不到吃早飯的時候，這曾經的確在老劉店裏發生的悲惨消息，就像晨風似地吹遍山谷中的每一個茅屋了。</p>
<p>老板一面吃着飯，一面說着這件事情，隨即帶着譏諷的口氣總結一句道：</p>
<p>「不曉得劉老烏龜昨夜又得了多少錢？……哼！這個老傢伙……」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，好像道學先生一樣，大約昨夜央求我的事情，今朝業已全然忘記了吧。</p>
<p>「損陰喪德哪」老板娘起初聽見老板說，就這樣駡了一句，現在聽完了，又重復這樣嘆了一聲，接着說道：「幸好没有在我們這裏。幸好……你的眼睛瞎了哪！」突然看見她的小女兒挾茶的時候，把袖頭拖在油湯裏面，就這麽了話頭。</p>
<p>「這還不是一樣的麽？」我接着這樣地想却没有說出，無味地吃了兩碗飯便　悄悄地走開了。</p>
<p>一面掃着馬糞一面難過地思索着：昨夜做了劊子手的，不正是我嗎？倘如没有老傢伙的那末一笑或者我能老着面皮毫不動氣的話，事情不仍然遊戱似地輕輕度過了麽？沉重的磚塊，壓上我的心頭了。</p>
<p>但是，内心的苛責，還正担受不起的時候却又加添了外面可怕的謠傳：昨夜老劉家的洋人是我引去的，並替他傳話，威嚇着那兒過夜的姑娘。</p>
<p>這一來，我更生氣，更發惱了。想着那些辯解不了的謠言，那兩個受污低泣的少女，便簡直恨老劉極了，無法减少心上的苦痛時，見着人家含意的微笑時，就只有忿忿地大駡一聲：</p>
<p>「老鬼哪！我詛咒你那末一笑」！</p>
<p>如今想起來，我是怎樣的一個懦弱而又好動感情的人呵！倘若那一夜把那色鬼痛打一頓，跑回中國，或者不顧譏笑，堅定下去，那末現在我的心上一定是清爽無垢，而也不會覺着痛苦的。</p>
<p>一被這件不愉快的往事，苦惱着的時候，除了切齒地駡一句「我詛咒你那末一笑」之外，不禁要想起那些勇敢的堅毅的人們而羡慕地說道：</p>
<p>「你們是有福的了！」　　　（完）</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、二月份期貨業已停止買賣、留待二十六日交割、市上祇做三月份期貨一個月、市面初漲後回、小起回風、紅盤以來、連漲四日、此係初見回疲、論環境并無破綻、論市價確已屆高度、暫行回小、亦意中事、惟以人心測度、諒無劇跌、或仍將先高而後低、昨日初拍、各帮仍有吸收、大都續好二三角、自金短爲四號三十號及三十八號等踴躍賣出、市價由上而下、反跌去三角半後、人心因此轉疲、整六等亦隨小二三角、次盤引起散户多頭之出籠、大户續有賣出、爲數已稀、市價乃一致回跌二三角至五六角不等、蓋以一般人因匪亂猖獗、多頭心思稍淡、并無其他關係也、市價結果、除一八關尚好三角外、餘則均跌落一二角至七角左右、成交總數、計共六百九十二萬八千元、内現貨三千元、期貨計六百九十三萬五千元、兹將其高低漲跌、列比較表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>廠商收貨聲中本月紗跳起一元五</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、形勢漸入佳境、因棉市難小、某巨廠盡量吸收、且倉庫中之存紗略减、但一般散户以實需尚滯、而各方商業不振、依然傾向抛賣、惟本月份營業爲最後一日、某廠决意收貨、午後最後一盤、跳起一元五角、爲一百八十一元五角、較上月交割價大漲十一元半、紗市就大勢論、頗有穏定之狀、</p>
<h3>人標賡豐抛出</h3>

<h3>期棉漢帮稍有套出</h3>
<p>趨勢難小未見跌風</p>
<p>棉市平靜、但美棉停市、印棉微漲、致人心平平、而紗市良好、致棉市穏定、但現棉生意雖清、各路到貨未旺、有一部份以美棉消息不能看跌、逢跌有做多之念、惟漢帮略有套出云、</p>
<h3>鄭標僅好二角</h3>

<h3>美棉停市英印小漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉市塲休業　利物浦棉現貨漲四點、期貨近期跌一點、遠期貨漲二點至四點、埃及棉現貨漲七點、孟買棉市、因投機家買進而漲、日商買進奥姆辣現貨、賣出白羅溪期貨、結果平加爾漲一羅比半、奥姆辣漲一羅比七角半、白羅溪漲七角半、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>

<h3>標粉有浮空抵補</h3>
<p>粉交今日起全日開拍</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼穏之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥無市、坎拿大回好一角半左右、故開市後、各月份市氣、仍然平平、旋因各帮浮空、均有抵補、廠家抛售、似略减少、兼之南洋帮、微有現貨生意、致市塲人心、稍形帶起、不過現麥洋、依然鬆動、如阿根庭麥喊價又低至四元一角三分、廠家祗還一角二分、故無成交、照洋麥之趨勢、恐仍在過剩中也、結果本月份徵好五厘、三月份好七厘半、四月份好分半、五月份好一分、六月份好一分半、七月份好七厘半、麵粉交易所二十四日起、全日照常開拍、燈節週逢交割日、聞不停市、</p>
<h3>廠方續收近期麥</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、上下午市面、一致步升、因期洋麥報大、現粉有南北洋去化、人心轉好、抵補甚活、且現麥廠化甚活、廠收現麥之外、又在交易所收買標準近期各月、結果本月又大三分、下月大二分、四月大四分、遠期有洋麥定貨、且爲新麥標準、故開市後即被新空套賣、收市六月份小五分、七月份進出兩少、未有上落、現貨開五河灣麥三元三角八九分、蚌埠三元三角二分、山東三元四角七分、共計二千一百包、由福新阜豐收進、市與前市相似、</p>
<h3>白粳薄稻各小一角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍稀、僅十五六號、（貨計二十餘石）、銷塲呆木、形勢無轉機之象、良以新春方始有以致之、回溯去年大結束時、店積薄弱、當斯紅盤開後、應有一番熱閙、不料今庚現象如斯、實出意外、昨初則尚覺美觀、迨至後市、即又沉而不浮、因之若本街所納之蘇同南港等粳、遂乏站定之力、疲落五分、其外常帮粳及杜洋尖等貨以缺貨無市、青角松泗楓練晚稻幸經南北洋兩帮續動七八百包、又賴貨稀俾藉定局、變元時令已過、猶屬平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各地來貨二十三四號、各貨銷胃呆細、市形日趨下游、白粳羊尖早薄稻價小一角、白元陰元平疲幾分、埠尖杜尖客尖亦帶軟勢</p>
<h3>客秈旺到價跌</h3>
<p>銷路異常滯鈍</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、更形疲軟、因陰歷年底初裝出之途貨、今已接連抵埠、加之存底本充、積貨愈多、貨主乃求售愈亟、昨本客辦胃均淡、閩帮日前裝出之外、尚有二萬包未經付裝、故有將存貨裝清再辦之說、昨祗本擬應酬二千包、但進意甚懈、今後恐須一度再懈之實現、寗波廣州有洋米裝到應市、胃口甚呆、本街注重河下到頭、去化亦微、各米一致下跌、中次尤疲、湖南油糙米竟尚在虚軟中、各因價跌引起本客暢銷、市面始可轉機、否則或須繼續疲軟也、</p>
<h3>雜糧走銷寥落</h3>
<p>雜糧現貨交易、逐見清淡、市態平疲如帮、昨市黄豆開穎州小粒一車、由江北帮採去、價售二元六角四、又寗波帮辦平湖杜豆二百包、價四元、内地辦二百包、崇明沙黄、價三元四角四至四角、菉豆則有廣帮採管店菜菉五十包、價三元八角八、烟台帮成小粒明光菉一百零七包、價二元五角六、福州帮僅納管店貨五十包、價六元五角三、尚有本街成交仚河小粒花生百餘包而已、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>赤白糖實銷尚未發動</h3>
<p>茹粉略有開出</p>
<p>糖市以實銷未動、人心觀望、故昨日公會劃盤如二四粗砂白又降一角、爲十七元七角、轉口貨六元六角、九號嗬赤十五元八角五分、八九號嗬赤十五元七角、太古Ｂ嘜二十元○一角五分、Ｗ○嘜二十元、成交均屬零星、一號本廠白仍十八元九角勿動、潮青下檔略有開出、如高半南十一元、隆江青十元○五角、宏發元利牌茹粉　過數十包、價九元二角、比前竟跌一元有零云、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>絲市前途悲觀</h3>
<p>紐約標凖絲價步跌　昨據本埠美絲商洋行傳出消息、紐約各絲織廠生絲消用雖增、而日絲廉價傾銷、致最近一旬中、絲價逐步下降、標凖現絲每磅已跌進美金一元五角大關、計步跌一角左右、滬白廠經Ｂ級八十二三分匀度、每包價扯合國幣亦跌近六百元（紐約交貨）云、</p>
<p>雙宫絲滬存稀薄　印席雙宫絲春銷發動、需要殷繁、滬埠雙宫絲廠祗福繪　一家照常開工、絲産有限、供不敷求、此次英輪拉瓦爾賓悌號開出、雙宫絲竟無運印、各洋棧存底統計祇七十餘包云、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>青鉛茶帮動辦</h3>
<p>青鉛交易、茶帮已有動辦、聞連日開出四五百條、每擔價爲十五元三角、係三月份交貨、此外如黄丹廠油漆公司錫紙廠等亦有交易、故市象殊覺樂觀、</p>
<h3>點錫現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>近來點錫現貨、因到源歉缺、市上流通貨極少、行情挺秀、如小砆每擔估一百八十二元、荷蘭每擔二百十八元、斗錫一百九十元、福足二百二十元、鈎光八十六元、焊錫七十元、聞連日祗有雜錫交易、此外小硔·荷蘭等錫、因無現貨、而少交易云、</p>
<h3>鎳格爾新貨裝到</h3>
<p>鎳格爾新貨已有裝到、堆存在浦西各洋棧者共有三四百擔、公會議價每擔爲二百七十元、如川漢各帮已有成交、本街爐坊亦有買賣、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>如是政局豈有此理</h3>
<p>— 雨夜</p>
<p>日本鳩山文相受賄案，閙得滿城風雨，烏烟障氣，故清瀬一郎說，如此政局，豈有此理。</p>
<p>因爲鳩山文相，到底係有地位，有勢力，有手段的人，所以證據可以堙没，法院不敢受理，有地位有勢力的人，究屬便宜得多，然而鳩山到底也不好意思，擬自行辭職，並不願出席審查會，鳩山文相雖然手段高强，自然也有一些難以爲情。</p>
<p>清瀨一郎在衆議院提出彈劾案後，並要求發言，謂「前據岡本君所言，操文化樞紐之鳩山君，畢竟有其犯罪行爲，驟聞堙没證據之事，實令人驚愕不置，」而在清瀨發言的時候，政友會議員，一齊入聲怒號，駡聲不絶，議塲騷擾不堪，這眞是豈有此理。</p>
<p>清瀨一郎又謂「鳩山文相逃稅，藏相爲安田保善社之顧問，諸如此類之政府，豈能得我們之信任，怪哉各派交涉會，竟拒絶提出不信任案，豈有此理，」清瀨一郎正在侃侃而談的時候，議塲騷擾不堪，秋田議長乃禁止清瀨發言，這亦眞是豈有此理。</p>
<p>若照我們的眼光看來，以鳩山的人格，文相的地位，做此受賄逃稅的勾當，有什麽希罕，值得清瀨如此大驚小怪，日本人到底眼孔小，氣量小，没有大國民的態度。</p>
<h3>咱們四個</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>咱們四個：不同籍貫不同個性，偶然在一個機會上把咱們連合起來。雖然没有做過「不求同日同時生，但求同日同時死」的玩意兒，可是咱們四個在精神上早已做到這一步手續。踏出校門以來，咱們分離了許多時候，去歲在鎭江又在一個偶然的機會上於伯先公園内合照一張像片丨這張像片今年又把咱們連合起來，原因是咱們中有二個半以上的人失業着的緣故。某一天，咱們談起到咱們四個人，經多數的同意，認爲有值得一寫「咱們四個」四個人的。這里，我忠實的經濟的對於每個人寫一段短短的縮影；就是咱們四個中的一個我，咱也脫離了「我」的立塲，純客觀地紀錄下來。或者讀者可以在「咱們四個」中發見「你們的你」！</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>大哥是個樂天知命，安分守己的青年。他前脚從學校跨出來，後脚踏進了銀行。他有很好的家庭，他安心於他的職位。而咱們另外三個，失業是常常錬鎖着的，大哥既没有領略失業的苦况；咱們自然不便將失業的痛苦去擾亂他安靜的心田。所以咱們三個中的一個，或二個，甚至三個去拜訪他，他是像普通朋友一般的接待咱們，咱們的談話也像普通朋友一般的不着邊際。咱們中大哥是最疏遠的一個是無可諱言的，環境的不同，把咱們的友誼拉遠了是事實。</p>
<p>大哥在銀行中從八塊錢一月的職位升到二十塊錢一月，他孜孜兀兀地向上爬；雖也曾發生無謂的嘆聲，說銀行飯没有吃頭，去年更爲了某種手續上的誤會，他自認吃虧賠出了一千數百元的鉅欵，最後從那個銀行換進了另一個銀行，於是他再向上爬…</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>老二是個祖父的孫兒，而不是祖母的；更不是母親的兒子。他没有父親。</p>
<p>在老二的故鄉，說起他的祖父是很有些名望的。傳下來的遺産，如其老二僅僅义义小麻將，上上茶館撩天，他可以到死不知道一枚銅元倒底值多少；然而飄流到上海來已經五年，爲什麽呢？天知道的！</p>
<p>他進洋行做打字員，做過土地局的起碼科員，小學教員，新聞記者，能寫點不甚高明的小品文字。五年之中，他過着馬浪蕩的生活。</p>
<p>他有過許多羅曼司的故事，在學校中的時候，「戀愛專家」接連在他的名字上；然而他和妻子戀愛的開始在結婚以後，現在已是一個孩子的爸爸。</p>
<p>他這傳了爸爸的肺菌，更喜歡喝酒，五年來没有適當的休養，於是他的生活担負上，醫藥費是經常支出的一部份，像房租，米糧一樣。</p>
<p>他自己常常擬爲老年人丨一個二十四歳的青年啊！的不回憶過去，他不憧憬未來，他不寳貴現在，他活着，爲生活而生活。</p>
<p>老二就是「我」。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我不知怎樣來開始寫老三？</p>
<p>他父親死，正是咱們在一個偶然的機會上連合起來的時候；他有一個不是自己母親的相依爲命的母親。</p>
<p>畢業後，由他父母托孤的一個父執帶他進他的買辦間，說起來是和大哥一般幸福的：前脚跨出學校，後脚踏進社會；然而，不！</p>
<p>他上嘴唇咬着下嘴唇對咱們說：「$４一月only」，自然，他没有承繼着遺産。</p>
<p>後來他被派到北國去，没有名義，是父執買辦獨資的分公司。分公司的經理認爲有驅逐他的必要！一個不知隨流合污的　子，誰都能這末想。</p>
<p>他拿了一年優越的三十塊錢一月的薪金，被父執買辦以分公司經理移交的罪名撤職了。至今失業着，可是他每天要吃飯，雙子和平常人在這一點上是一樣的；還有個不是自己母親的相依爲命的母親。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>咱們都說老四在任何條件上都比咱們好，老四自已卻不承認。能認爲「遺憾」的，（老四的口頭禪）我也知道得清楚，但在「忠實」範圍之外我破例不能寫了。總之，是終身的「遺憾」！</p>
<p>他是個不可捉摸的人物，從咱們相識起到現在，他的行爲舉止上没有些微的改變。他是「台形」的發明家，他寗願没有香烟抽，要抽起碼是絞盤牌，一二八之後，改抽白金龍，倒是個愛國實行家。</p>
<p>他快活的時候，可以把袋中僅有的兩毛錢去逛大世界。悲哀的時候，改用喝靠櫃台酒。如其他今天袋中有整張的十元钞票，他要咱們想法子將鈔票派用塲，用塲愈新奇愈妙。</p>
<p>和他嘆窮還好，不過伸起兩手裝一下勞萊的苦相丨可是無論如何没有咱裝得像。要是談到「遺憾」，他要喝酒了，没有錢到處可以借，喝醉了哭，哭過後又覺得太無聊。</p>
<p>還有件事在他生命史不可不提的：咱結婚的時候，他爲了鬧房的失敗，幾乎同咱翻臉，咱至今認爲「遺憾」。</p>
<p>這就是咱們四個！</p>
<h3>回力球塲速寫</h3>
<p>— 薦</p>
<p>霞飛路的　　，　紅的藍的綠的那年紅的電光寫着字的國泰大戲院，張着大嘴已已經在吸吞着一些外國紳士太太和高等華人的時候，隔馬路的亚爾培路的汽車停在回力球塲門前的更多，進回力球塲的人正如川流一樣洶湧十分。</p>
<p>（這回力球的玩藝兒，本來是西班牙人的一種練身運動，後來却成了賭博的一種方式，在上海更是和跑狗一樣地在吸收着一班賭徒的金錢。而這些賭徒，其中有商人，紳士，大學教授，電影明星，學生小姐，九流三教，同歸於此。）</p>
<p>鐵網以内，球在賽着；鐵網以外，如山坡一樣的座位人如山一樣的在坐着，站着，吸烟，談話，鼓掌，吹嘘。在兩邊，高高地掛着黑底白字的賭賽表，人們跟着那表上的標識在呌着，「二號三分了！」「二號四分了。位子是穏得的了！」「五號，兩分，媽的！」</p>
<p>笛子一呌，塲裏電燈轉暗，觀座轉亮，人聲鼎沸，「二號，五分！」不知是誰在歡地大呌起來。坐在這人的附近有一對青年夫婦，那男的聽了這種歡呼聲，瘦黄的臉上更加變成蒼白色，嘴裏咕嚕地好像在駡着什麽人，隨手將那不中彩的票子扯成碎片；那女的聽了這種歡呼聲，紅潤的臉上更加變成血紅色，眼光瞠住前方，也將手上的廢票扯碎了。</p>
<p>「我說今晚二號一定來，你偏不信！」女的埋怨着說，眼睛仍然瞠住前方。</p>
<p>「五號昨晚不是常常來的嗎？今晚他偏不來，又有什麽辦法？丨媽的！男的伸辯起來。</p>
<p>「在霞飛路有人在呌黄包車，要兩部，這二號的兆頭就不錯。」</p>
<p>「呃，你信那些！」</p>
<p>那男的說着，吩咐站在他旁邊等客人買票的僕歐，「五號獨赢兩張。」那女的說，「二號位子一張。」那男的說，「二號不會來了。」那女的冷笑了一聲，回過臉去看鐵網裏頭在未開賽前練習打球的球員，眼光正射着那穿着二號制服的依甲蘇球員的矯健的身體。</p>
<p>無綫電音樂在急奏着。人的潮，湧到後面賣票處，又湧到前面鐵網前。笛子呌了，開賽。一刹那間的靜寂，只聽到球碰到堅壁的畢畢的聲音。球碰到地板，二號一分，再碰到地板，二號二分，第三回對方的球又碰到地板，二號三分，人們的談話聲喧嘩起來了。</p>
<p>「二號這回一定還是來的。」買二號票子的人說，臉上的表情是歡樂得意，丨吸了一枝香烟。</p>
<p>「一號眞是飯桶！」買一號的人嘆氣發恨，臉上的表情是憤恨懊喪，只香烟摔在脚下，踏着。</p>
<p>「二號五分！」有人在狂歡地呌起來。音樂起奏，人聲嘈雜。</p>
<p>又是二號嬴了。</p>
<p>那女的得了一張位子的錢四元二角，對那男的冷笑一聲說，「不聽我的話，現在五號來了没有？」男的說，「你看，這回五號一定來了。」女的從鼻孔裏頭哼出了一聲不理他。男的又吩咐僕歐買五號獨嬴兩張。女的又要買二號位子一張，男的制止了她說，「這回二號還來嗎，傻瓜？」女的半信半疑地將伸出的錢拿回來。</p>
<p>笛子又呌，又開賽，二號又是五分。</p>
<p>那女的立刻站起身，臉上的表情，是對那男的表現了一種惱恨與輕蔑的神氣。</p>
<p>「怎麽？」</p>
<p>「回家！」</p>
<p>「多一盤，再走。」</p>
<p>女的忍氣似地，並不回答地坐下。等了一回，尖銳地盛氣地短促地說了一句，</p>
<p>「五號來了？」</p>
<p>男的臉上的表情，本來是懊喪的，聽了女的那責問立刻變成厭惡和憤恨，隨手將香烟掉在脚下。</p>
<p>「不來也要買！」</p>
<p>女的聽出了男的脾氣在發作，將唾涎吞了一下，聳着肩膀，聳着眼睛，忍氣地沉默着，男的發了脾氣没有回響，反而柔聲下氣地說，「他不來又有什麽辦法呢？」女的脾氣反而發了，又是尖銳地盛氣地短促地說了一句，「不是呌你買二號嗎？」男的軟化下去了，自知錯誤似地陪罪似地向女的媚笑了一下說，「這回一定買二號，好嗎？」「先聽我的話，不是嬴了？」女的也笑了。</p>
<p>無綫電音樂在奏着。人的潮，在湧前湧後。笛子又呌了。開賽。</p>
<p>無綫電音樂又停了，人們的聲音也靜止　　又是史帶到球　到鹽壁的　　。</p>
<p>「三號，四分，五分！」買三號的人們在鼓掌着，今晚只來這一回。</p>
<p>那女的又是憤恨又是懊喪，而且是對於他的丈夫萬分抱歉似地說，</p>
<p>「這回二號偏不來；」</p>
<p>「回去。」男的站起了身。</p>
<p>女的表示着抱歉的神情朝他的丈夫一望，那男的站在那裏看着他的妻的表情，忽然憤恨全消地微笑着對她說，「時間不早了，明天還得上課。」</p>
<p>女的也微笑了，穿了大衣跟着在丈夫的後面從人叢中出了回力球塲的門口。</p>
<h3>處世藝術之一</h3>
<p>— 乃碩</p>
<p>隨便從那方面看去，這世界，若想做人，總要懂得學乖。這絶然是好的，理由無須多說。</p>
<p>一來在頭等電車裏便怪起勁的學着洋人讓位子給女人，而一來在三等電車裏却老實不客氣地白　着眼睛而望着那些站脚不住，東歪西倒的女人發笑，好像那讓位子的洋禮，是一古老兒全都忘記了的人們，我都可以呌他是懂得學乖的，而這學乖的程度却也委實可觀。</p>
<p>本來，比方就是講洋禮一樣，便祗有在那些滿有洋氣的地方，才鬧得起勁。不是，白費力氣是討不了好的。喊莫林索或是搖着手的把戲兒，是祗有在洋大人面前，或是懂得這一徑的先生們才透着勁勢的。若是抓着一個鄉下老的手搖幾下，或是說幾句嘰嘰咕咕的洋涇浜，他若不是疑心你是在開着玩笑，就會疑心你是在駡着他的。結果一定是討着一塲没趣。</p>
<p>所以一般心乖嘴乖嘴得學乖的人們，便總是走進洋派的地方便行着洋禮，對於穿得洋派的女人便是祖宗，好像把屁股頂在自己的頭上也是樂得，也是應該似地，這倒是常事。至於走到三等電車裏去了，則不煩盡量地顯示男人便是國王，女人這東西一挨近了他，便好像觸了霉頭似的。於是即管人家站得兩腿發酸了，若是有地方可以靠睡，還得儘羞自己神長腿子睡覺的。</p>
<p>非其人不與語其道，先王之禮也，　國之　神也，　兩們國人　是古　的嫡裔，在洋大人的勎力下還能够這樣兒，眞是不可多得的。</p>

<p>賞着那老處如的各種嫉　　　前，也實是　入世間的幸福。因　　修在　　的感情　　找出些可笑的　　　　，眞够稱得是懂得安排着自己　　　的　　漠子。</p>
<p>明明是朱美麗的可愛的花，而偏偏　　　　　　，踐踏着的，這是祇有老　女這一　的人才做得出的。明明是個可人的天氣，懂得取樂的，是個最好把自已抛擲在那種野游的陶醉裏的時機，而偏偏要把牠詛咒着，毒駡着的，也　有這般老處女。把戀愛當做是種罪惡，把男女的接近當做是種人間最不潔淨的行爲，除了這般老處女之外，也是没有别的人類的。</p>
<p>這諸般的乖謬的行爲，一樣也是出自於所謂同是人類的手中，似乎是異常詫異的，不過一想起狗類也有瘋狗的那一點，却也覺得這種事實似乎没有甚麽大不該。從此而反去用心地體會起來，怕也會發覺這種行爲的乖謬也是種事理發展的必至。</p>
<p>從老年人嚴禁青年人去儘情地享樂這點看起來，似乎這問題就已得了那解釋的關键。好像老處女一樣，當着老年人要實行他那上述的用心的時候，他總要用着許多倫理的道德的名詞，一從他的話裏聽起來，好像他眞是把青年人關切得不得了似地。可是當我們一按實着他那話裏的眞意，顯見不外是由於一種嫉妬的行爲。因爲享樂常是將老人除外，而戀愛的勝利則常是屬於青年的人，然而這二者都又無可否認地固爲老年人所熱求。</p>
<p>像老年人一樣，享樂和戀愛也是老處女所熱求的。然而其結果，却總是爲享樂和戀愛所排除。於是而想着享樂是人人可追求，却被事實否准這一點，因是而起着一股惡劣的感情，而惱羞成怒地毒惡地駡着那得意的人們，究也是自然而然的事實。</p>
<p>於是從這點而想着那摘不到葡萄而駡着酸葡萄的骚狐狸，從這狐狸又轉念到這種老處女，要說這其間是一點找不到樂趣的，那怕眞是不足與語之流。</p>
<h3>死了父親底悲哀</h3>
<p>— 青</p>
<p>「你父親今天好些了没有？」這是在最近幾天裏我看見了娟就向她這樣訪問的，因爲她近幾天時常到我這裏來告假要早些回去侍候她的父親，因爲她的父親老人家的病狀日篤，醫生都告施救乏術了。平時我知道娟的學業品行都很使我滿意，所以我對於她的一切分外的關切着。</p>
<p>『父親至今晨六時逝世了』娟含涙告訴我當我又問長她「娟，你的父親好些了没有？」的時候。『我的名雖已經報了，但是不知下學期書還有可能繼續讀否，雖然大媽媽的哥哥老是安慰我說』娟妹，以後我不會虧待你的」。』說這話時她的眼涙地從眼角一直流到願邊。</p>
<p>接着，她又告訴我說下面的一段話：『我的媽在名義上是處於妄的地位，因爲在十年以前，父親因遭失業，所以家境日落，大媽媽丨丨父親的前妻見父親是一個窮措大就生異心帶了自己生的兒子離棄了父親。逾年，父親生意慢慢的好起來就娶了我的母親來，現在我有一個哥哥天資愚呆，還有一個小弟還是襁抱嬰孩。』</p>
<p>唉！處在這樣環境之下的娟，而竟失去了她們經濟和其他的保障者父親，她們此後的生活，是太寒愴悽苦了！這樣一個可裁培的有爲的人，又失去了栽她的園丁！是命運嗎？</p>
<p>此時，我的眼前也呈現出自己父親逝世的一幕情景來了，唉！我和娟是同陷了一個悲哀的命運！</p>
<p>自己的母親做了人家的繼母，什麽麻煩　不幸都會　到　我們孩子的身上了。</p>
<p>這是四年前某日的事了。父親逝世的噩耗竟帶進了我的耳膜裏，接到家報以後就是夜奔喪，因爲我那時漂泊在當天色黎明的時候，輪船抵埠，把我這孤單單的身子帶回了故鄉而跪在父親靈前的時候，我的心碎製開了！唉！親愛慈祥的父親畢竟是離我而長眠了。呵！父親，天之角，海之涯，何處去尋找愛我的父親呢？</p>
<p>那時我還記得哥哥之是同樣的安慰我說：「不會虧待你的。」啊·現在，事實的答覆又是怎樣呢？………</p>
<h3>城隍廟</h3>
<p>— 文里</p>
<p>城裏城隍廟未曾到過上海的人誰不聞名？</p>
<p>這日正是舊歷年初一，聽說城裏城隍廟今天最熱鬧，在馬路上逛一逛便走到城裏來了。民國路建舊時城牆所在，早已經遊人如鯽熱鬧非常，走進城裏近小世界游戲塲的地方，遊人之多，直使俺擠得汗流浹背。後面忽然還聽到汽車哇哇的呌聲，俺也跟着大家奔避在牆脚下；看那汽車裏坐着一位皮大領黑眼鏡的老爺，旁邊搖着一位嬌滴滴的太太，他們逛城隍廟是坐汽車的，看汽車進去成不成？站崗的警察，揮動棍子大喝遊人走開，可是路小人又多，汽車威風亦没有方法逞出，老爺和太太也只得步行。你步行，俺也步行，後面的人潮偏起了波浪，一擁兩擠，老爺太太被困在當中，浮着身子走，喘不出氣。俺心想，今日裏窮富也就分不清，你不願意流汗擁擠，你最好站開向後轉。可是老爺太太偏也逞强，笑嬉嬉地跟着人潮上了九曲橋。俺一面擁擠着走，一面看那九曲橋下的水，青苔浮盪着並非清徹到底如鏡可鑑，心裏不大高興。忽然前頭起了衝突，人聲吼喊，呌駡四起，俺站高一看，原來却是一羣娘兒們被困在橋的中心，前後擁擠，進退不得，正在那兒和前後左右的人們吵嘴。橋的中心既然塞住，這邊也就進不得，可是也退不得，於是乎大家都站住，俺也站住。俺在站住的時候，腦膜上浮現了一些記憶：故鄉在每年遊神燈會的時候，娘兒們被人困在垓心那一種惨狀眞是難看。那一些流氓無赖上下其手，簡直是獸類的行動，而娘兒們的受辱，哭笑不得。俺抬頭看一看這時九曲橋上的娘兒們，還好，他們雖然困在垓心，却是還能够呌駡得開人們的擁擠，而慢慢地向前走去了。</p>
<p>進了城隍廟後殿，香烟薰得俺眼睛難以睜開，不由俺看個明白，只得跟着人潮轉出前殿，擠出廟前街上。在街上賣玩具的賣響陀螺的特别多，有一間賣賤貨首飾店，那呌賣者的男人，耳朶上掛着珠墜子，頸上圍着假金鋼鑽，手上也戴着式指珠寳之類，眞是一個活招牌。轉了圈子到了賣鳥籠的街，春是未到的吧，不聞鳥聲，但見籠子。人的潮只是湧着，俺背上的汗流得太多，口有點渴，抬頭看見路邊有一間湯團舖，搶上前進去吃碗湯團，人也是滿的。不知道是不是肚餓，湯團怪好吃的，人家說城隍廟的湯團有名，俺今天或者也就有口福了。出了湯團舖，又跟着人潮退出來，一路上賣花磴兒的賣汽球的，紅綠滿目，俺如果家裏有個把小孩兒一定買他一兩個花燈兒。擠到民國路上，游人稀少，俺這才伸了一口氣，舒舒服服地走回家。</p>
<h3>最大的希望</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>五年來寫的日記積着幾厚册了。在每年開始的時候，總像傳道者一樣寫上許多美麗的希望，到年底結一下總賬，却大大的嚇了自己。誠然，有了希望，纔感覺到過後的失望；如春你渾渾噩噩的日子，恐怡倒不會有悲哀的感覺的；但是我是一個人，有頭腦，有思想，自己明知騙自己，也會一年一年騙着自己到我死去。</p>
<p>現在又是新年，是我流浪生活第六年的開始，多少依着自己騙自己的原則，來寫幾句希望的話。可是這類希望的話，在質的方面已一年一年减少下去，到今年，實在再不能重覆從前的那種希望了，因爲牠給我的失望太大，所以避重就輕在我日記的開端留下一些墨跡罷。</p>
<p>我似乎覺得我這一個人老是一天到晚的勞動着，勞心，勞力，把自己已榨成了人乾，和像要拍賣也已不值幾個錢，買猪的人當然揀壯的買，我對於這個病體，想大大的希望一番。我的朋友們知道我的，我隔一天到醫生那裏去打針，如其針眼可以永遠遺留著的話，我整了兩條手臂上已没有一塊乾凈肉了。可是還不中用。人是一天一天一年一年瘦下去，我也曾幻想過一個人倒底會瘦到什麽地步，就拿我自己來做試騐品，看他瘦。然而又不能，這就是說我不吃飯不要緊咞我的妻子兒子不能也不吃飯，要掙飯吃，就要勞動，於是我再打針，預備自己的身體有人來收買的一天。</p>
<p>所以我今年的大希望，能够安安靜靜地在醫院裏躺上三個月，一年更好，利用科學方法使體重增加（最緊要聲明的，我並不因我的瘦而怕死，上帝知道我的）不過最大的問題，醫生雖有割股之心，倒貼醫藥費的在我還没有看見過。錢，錢，錢，牠圓滾滾的在我面前幌了半天，我選擇了最穏當的辦法買一條航空奬劵，一種拜不抽烟掷還不致於癮死，而後來的「希望」是無窮呢。</p>
<p>現在我等着，等三月二號快些到，假使以後讀者不發現黛妮的騙錢稿子，他已經進了醫院，他預備壯一點之後再拍賣，如其讀者中想作成這　生意的，請你們也希望着，希望我中第四期的航空奬劵。</p>

<h3>幾個法律問題的解答（一）</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>年輕識淺的我，對於世事，當然有許多的不明瞭；現在把我腦子裏徘徊着而且急於要解决的幾個問題寫出來，請你解答；想來慈愛如母的先生，終能答應我的吧！</p>
<p>一、我的伯母，没有兒子，所以在十年前，雇養人家的兒子，後來她欲養親生之女，就把人家的兒子，百般驅逐；該兒因受不了痛苦，卒返娘家。惟此兒在我的伯母的翁婆死時，曾帶重孝，照習慣當爲孝孫，如此，此兒可否得有遺産之權。</p>
<p>二、伯母之壻來頂户繼承，可否改其本姓，近房可否對之拒絶；或有得遺産之權。</p>
<p>先生：你是青年的南針，上面二個問題，很誠懇的請你解答吧！專此盼候，即請撰安　張鵬謹上</p>
<p>編者按：</p>
<p>（一）養父母可與養子女終止收養關係，依法應以書面爲之，照來件所述則仍在收養關係存續中，自有繼承遺産之權，惟其應繼份爲婚生子女之半，並應注意令伯死亡年月，蓋死亡在民國十六年以後，其女始有承繼權。</p>
<p>（二）贅壻近房雖不得反對惟無承繼遺産權。</p>

<h3>夫婦（七）</h3>
<p>— 俞梅</p>
<p>「不要緊，你進去吧。好生風吹着。」</p>
<p>三姑娘心裏笑着，推上大門，把燈放到桌上，將桌邊火桶内火缽裏的火翻了一下，便登了上去，全身縮在一起。她望着床上的燈光，心想着一些失去確定時間的往事。她的影子映在墻上，糢糊的，她的影子映在這墻上已有過許多年了。雖然生活上强烈的需要未曾受過遏制，雖然有過記不清的唇皮和數不清的手點綴過她的榮盛年華，雖然穿過令男子對她發生願俸侍的心情的衣服，但她的生活在食衣住上所具體表現的是她自己也明白算不得是好的。雖然做過違反定命主義的行爲，她的思想却是定命的。丈夫對她是生活上的一個裝飾品，她知道自己不會有發財的命運，她却常常希望她會有滿滿一箱鈔票。</p>
<p>一切是異常安靜。遠處有鑼鼓的響聲。這聲音引起了她的懷舊情緒，在多年前聽這種聲音時的那高興榮耀神情映了出來，而今她覺得這羅聲只襯得她荒凉衰老，但一切過去都是糢糊不清的。有一陣微微的風在低矮的屋脊上響。她把頭縮得更緊了一點。</p>
<p>過後，大門響了。有脚步聲向裏走來。這熟悉了的步聲把她的耳朶伸長了。她連忙把烟單上的洋錢拿在手裏，裝了起來，又登進火桶内去了。她問，</p>
<p>「這時候又跑回來幹什麽事？」</p>
<p>本是想來家安息一夜的徐三倒忽然不知所答了。他囁嚅着說，「來家看看。」</p>
<p>他已走進房裏來了。他做着笑臉，看着妻的没有精神的樣子，問道，</p>
<p>「丢了錢没有？」他的嘴邊還是掛着笑容。</p>
<p>「没有。那能老呌人家丢錢。」三姑娘没有神氣地說着，頭又低下了。</p>
<p>「哏。」徐三哏着，要說的話都嚥在喉嚨裏。他站到妻的身邊，想把空氣轉換一下。</p>
<p>「這兩天過年，你又不想到在塲子上多做一點生意。烟灰出來了没有？」</p>
<p>「烟灰都出了。在塲子上。」丈夫知道自己爲涶活計也不能盡歡了。</p>
<p>「我今晚上有點頭痛。」她用手摸撫着額頭。她把他的一切企望都消除了。</p>
<p>「呵。」徐三把安慰的意思也籍一聲呵表示了。他默着。</p>
<p>「你多拿一點烟去，趁這時候多做一點生意也好。」</p>
<p>「我想今晚上不去了，這兩天累死人了。没有一天睡好覺。」</p>
<p>「這兩天不忙什麽時候忙？今晚上說不定還會有人來吃烟，這兩天人家講事情談心都忙得很。我頭痛就和刀劈一樣，今晚說不定要到夜裏還要伺候人。」</p>
<p>徐三不再有話可說。三姑娘要他無論如何在賭塲上上去多做一點生意，給了他許多包烟，她自己又没精打彩地回到火桶上蹲着。徐三留戀了一下，相信她是老病又發，便蹌踉地走出了房。她懶慵慵地說，</p>
<p>「把大門帶嚴了。」</p>

<h3>Military Resolution to Block Sun's Forces and Defend the Gansu-Shaanxi Border</h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui Telegraphs Urgent Plea</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Army Completes Concentration</p>
<p>Sun's Troops at Linhe Rush to Build Fortifications Around Sanshenggong</p>
<p>Sun Commands from Ligangbao, Planning a Full-Scale Attack on Ningyuan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military operations to encircle and suppress Sun's forces are still being planned. The authorities believe that the two bandits Xu and Liu may flee to Shaanxi Province and collude with Sun, and have decided to have the Jin army defend against Sun, while troops will be transferred from Hubei, Henan, and Anhui to defend against the two bandits Xu and Liu. Zhang Xueliang will be able to begin deployments after taking office. A regiment of a certain division stationed in Tongguan has already entered southern Shaanxi, and troops from Longnan are going to defend the Gansu-Shaanxi border. All replenishments for a certain unit here have been completed, and negotiations are underway regarding passage through Shaanxi and cooperation. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reports, personnel from Sun's army stationed at the Linhe supply depot, as well as various units of the 119th Division west of Linhe, are rushing to the Sanshenggong area overnight and building defensive fortifications. They are strictly checking all passersby. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jin-Sui army has gradually completed its concentration. The majority of infantry and cavalry have arrived in Linhe. Sun himself has gone to Ligangbao to command, planning a full-scale attack on Ningyuan. If it is not taken within two days, he will lead his troops to flee to northern Shaanxi, securing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to unpaid military expenses for the Jin-Sui army, Fu Zuoyi has returned to Suiyuan without a definite return date. Sources say that the authorities, due to financial difficulties, must telegraph Jiang for instructions regarding the Jin-Sui army's mobilization expenses. According to military reports, both armies at the front are feeling exhausted and are still locked in a stalemate. However, Ningma has again telegraphed an urgent plea, stating that Sun's army has launched another full-scale offensive, requesting that Fu's division be urged to mobilize quickly. (Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In recent days, Sun Dianying has personally led daredevil squads in the vicinity of Ningyuan, around the Great and Small Mosques and Mandabridge, directing offensives towards Ningxia and Pingluo. The fighting is fierce, but Sun's troops have suffered heavy casualties due to aerial reconnaissance and bombing. The 15th Route Army and various other divisions are making every effort to resist, and the situation remains unchanged. Ma Hongkui telegraphed He Yingqin and Fu Zuoyi again on the morning of the 23rd, reporting on the battle situation and requesting that the Jin-Sui armies quickly join forces to thoroughly suppress the bandits. Wang Jingguo's Sui army has fully assembled at Linsha. Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry advanced from Linhe towards Sanshenggong on the morning of the 22nd. The vanguard was very close to Sun's army's sentries. Sun's army fired a warning shot, but Zhao's troops did not return fire. Due to exhausted supplies and difficult transportation, Sun's army has abandoned all military vehicles near Chenggkou, Pingluo, Shizuizi, and Ligangbao due to a lack of gasoline. The civilians' grain in various villages has been completely plundered, and residents, unable to endure the harassment, are fleeing to the Jin-Sui border. Sun has also declared that if he cannot capture Ningxia, he will lead his troops west and become bandits on the Shaanxi-Gansu border. Rumors that Sun is plotting to collude with the Xu bandit and Liu Guitang are being investigated and are deemed highly unlikely. The garrisons of the northwestern provinces have long been on strict alert. Furthermore, Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi's departure date is yet to be determined, as they are still discussing Sun's army expenses. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Yukun stated that after he and others advised Sun to obey orders, downsize, and reduce the people's suffering, they have not received a reply as of the 23rd. The smaller units of Sun's army, consisting mostly of mounted bandits led by Yang Hou, have sporadically crossed Zhongwei. Sun's formal troops are being blocked, and their movements cannot be so rapid. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The fighting near Ningxia City is still ongoing. Sun Dianying has declared that he will not stop fighting until he has captured Ningxia. It is still unknown when Fu Zuoyi will go to Suiyuan. The Beiping Military Council has dispatched twenty personnel to accompany the transfer to Suiyuan to prepare for the establishment of supply depots along the Ping-Sui Railway and has allocated approximately twenty military vehicles to transport Jin-Sui troops from Dengkou to Ningxia.

<h3>Warning to All Countries Regarding the Issue of Recognizing the Puppet State of Manchukuo</h3>
<p>According to the principles of international law, for a new nation to join the international community and establish normal diplomatic relations with other countries, it must first be recognized by those countries. Only then is its "statehood" complete. Every nation has the freedom to recognize new countries, but some new countries are formed by the division of older countries and lack a solid foundation of stability or genuine independent status. If recognized rashly, it may be suspected of interfering in the internal affairs of the original country and could even lead to international war. For example, in the early years of the American declaration of independence, Britain was suppressing the rebellion, and France recognized America prematurely. Britain was greatly dissatisfied and directly declared war on France, which is a very clear example.</p>
<p>The puppet organization of Manchukuo "cannot be considered to have arisen from a genuine and natural independent movement," as the League of Nations Investigation Commission has clearly pointed out, deeply impressing the minds of people around the world. There is absolutely no room for doubt that Manchukuo is unworthy of recognition. Moreover, after the statement in the Stimson Doctrine by United States Secretary of State on January 7, 1932, the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 11 of the same year, and the notice of the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations Special Assembly on June 7, 1933, the principle of non-recognition has further evolved from a theoretical proposition to an international obligation. From this perspective, those countries bound by the principle of non-recognition, whether the binding force is moral or legal, must naturally adhere to their established policy even more. However, according to recent dispatches, there are reports that Germany is about to recognize Manchukuo and that the United States may abandon the Stimson Doctrine. If these reports become reality, then our country's years of crying out and appealing to the outside world will have been in vain and of no value, and the unreliability of empty international sympathy should also give us a great lesson.</p>
<p>Assuming that the countries concerned truly abandon the principle of non-recognition and formally join hands with Manchukuo, we can imagine the reasons they might use as pretexts, which would be no more than the following two:</p>
<p>First, Manchukuo was created by Japan, and Japan was the first to recognize Manchukuo. However, China, apart from protesting at the time of Japan's recognition, still maintains friendly relations with Japan. Therefore, it can be determined that even if other countries follow suit and recognize the puppet organization, and the results have some adverse effects on China's relations, the extent of the deterioration will certainly not exceed the current Sino-Japanese relations. Moreover, recognizing the puppet organization can bring significant benefits, and weighing the pros and cons, it is by no means unwise.</p>
<p>Second, the spirit of the League of Nations resolutions must be respected, but practical problems must also be considered. Although China has not made any indication of abandoning sovereignty over Manchuria, it is a fact that China, both the government and the people, have not taken active steps to recover the homeland for years. Therefore, other countries may consider that the rebels have, in fact, already become independent. In other words, China's passive attitude proves that it cannot subdue the rebels, and therefore, according to international law, China cannot prevent other countries from fulfilling their obligations and freedoms to recognize new countries.</p>
<p>If this kind of thinking is true, we cannot but consider it fundamentally wrong. If the sacred and inviolable League of Nations resolutions can be overturned at will, what international justice and international credibility are left to speak of? And why bother to punish Japan for its violent acts of breaking treaties? The reason why our country maintains diplomatic relations with Japan is only out of factual needs and is unavoidable. Based on this alone to say that Sino-Japanese relations are friendly is going too far, and even to refer to the organization of Manchukuo as the result of rebellion is somewhat inaccurate. It should be known that the traitors who betrayed the country account for only a very small number of all the people in Manchuria, and who among the rest does not cherish the motherland and yearn to break free from the shackles of foreign rule? If the countries "do not see their virtues through to the end" and actually take the absurd action of recognizing Manchukuo, the Chinese people will have a very serious response and will never be reconciled.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also feel that in order for countries to continue to maintain their policy of non-recognition, we must strive ourselves, otherwise, even if countries continue their non-recognition, it will not help the current situation in any way, and the four northeastern provinces will be completely lost. We have already suffered a lot of stimulation and blows in the past. Shouldn't we directly, frankly, and practically work hard on our own to seek the final victory of restoring our homeland?</p>

<h3>Reasons for Prince Yun's Resignation</h3>
<p>Differences in Political Views with Prince De</p>
<p>Placed in a Difficult Position</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain prince who came to Beiping from Mongolia, the reasons for Prince Yun's telegram to the Executive Yuan's Mongolian Council resigning from his post are: (1) There were considerable differences between Prince Yun and Prince De regarding the advocacy of Inner Mongolian autonomy. Prince De was determined to complete a high degree of autonomy, and negotiations with the Inner Mongolian Local Autonomy Affairs Committee nearly broke down. Prince Yun advocated accommodating the Inner Mongolian Local Autonomy Affairs Committee's views and establishing two autonomous regions. Prince De reluctantly agreed, but in fact, their conflicting political views remained. (2) The Ulanqab League is near the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and its views on autonomy differ greatly from Prince De's and do not entirely agree with Prince Yun's, placing Prince Yun in a difficult position. (3) The Ulanqab League representatives have already been sent out, but the Xilin Gol League representatives have not, which is also a point where Prince Yun is not understood by others. Prince Yun's request to resign is indeed due to considerable hardship. The Mongolian Council's attempt to retain him is likely to be ineffective. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Calls for Avoiding War with the United States</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Saito Obeys Orders in the United States</p>
<p>Actively Conducting Gentlemen's Agreement</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's plenary session of the House of Peers' Budget Committee, Baron Toshiatsu Sakamoto of the Koseikai asked the government what preparations it had made for the Washington and London conferences and whether it intended to conclude a gentlemen's agreement with the United States. In response, Foreign Minister Hirota replied that Japan had decided to propose changes to the ratio at the two conferences in 1935 and 1936, and the Navy Ministry was currently studying countermeasures. War between Japan and the United States should be avoided. To maintain peace, Ambassador Saito has been instructed to actively contact the U.S. government, and once there are substantial results, Ambassador Saito will be ordered to return home to report. Regarding the gentlemen's agreement, it will be decided when Japanese and American opinions are close. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Deeply Consider Attitude Towards Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>Temporarily Expressing No Opinion</p>
<p>(Washington) There is a rumor in Europe that certain countries may soon recognize "Manchukuo." According to news from the White House, the United States will naturally consider this situation, but the principle announced by former Secretary of State Stimson, namely not recognizing countries created by violence or aggression, may not be implemented mechanically. This matter was mentioned in yesterday's dispatch. It is now learned that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull will give this issue deep consideration and do not wish to express any opinion before considering it. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports, the United States is now considering changing its attitude towards "Manchukuo" and is also planning to require the Philippine Islands to accept the original plan for Philippine independence (proposed by U.S. Congressmen Hawes and Cutting), with the condition that the United States will abandon all its military bases in the Philippines fifteen years after acceptance. Some members of the British Conservative Party have expressed welcome to this news. This faction has always regretted the increasingly strained relations between the United States and Japan. The Morning Post, which most prominently represents this tendency, while expressing its approval of the above news, raised an important reservation, saying that when the United States previously advocated maintaining the status quo in Manchuria, it had the support of European countries. If it now changes its original policy, the British government's attitude should be coordinated with the United States. The United States should consider this. It has recently been heard that Germany intends to recognize the "Manchukuo" government for commercial reasons. If the United States also intends to take the same action, it must first consult with all the countries that previously assisted the United States in adopting the old policy of not recognizing "Manchukuo" before it can do so. If the United States does not do so and acts alone, it may not be an honorable thing to do. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sacrificing One Dove, Minister Hatoyama, to Extend Saito's Cabinet's Life</h3>

<p>To Avoid Giving the Military a Chance to Disrupt Constitutional Government</p>
<p>Upper House Objects to Answering Agent</p>
<p>Saito Expected to Attend Parliament Next Monday Despite Illness</p>
<p>Bribery Case Involves President Hamaguchi</p>
<p>Minseito's Arrogance Greatly Diminished, No Longer Pursuing Vigorously</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has decided on its highest policy: to acknowledge the sole resignation of Minister of Education Hatoyama, while the issue of the government's advance or retreat will be decided after the budget is passed and Parliament successfully concludes its session, observing the objective situation in the political world. Judging from this, if no sudden events occur in the political world, the changes will be extended until after Parliament, and the unusually tense political situation of recent days will temporarily come to an end on the surface. During the imperial prince's birthday celebration, which begins today, the political world will temporarily show a peaceful state, but its undercurrents have not ceased, and it is impossible to predict what political changes it will cause in the future. (23rd Japan Federation Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minseito members held a meeting at 3:00 PM today, attended by 24 members including Takahashi, to deliberate on countermeasures for the current situation. They believed that the bribery case revealed by Kazumi Okamoto was orchestrated by the military behind the scenes to take advantage of this opportunity to destroy the credibility of political parties. Political parties should not fall for it and should stop the disputes and unanimously confront the conspiracy to undermine constitutional government. Two resolutions were made: (1) to reform the political world and (2) to expel those who disrupt political parties, using this policy to start a movement to unite political parties to confront the military. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Centered on young Minseito members, a meeting of concerned members was scheduled to discuss the current situation. Recently, within the party, it has been recognized that fascist forces are active behind the Okamoto issue, creating a crisis for parliamentary politics. At this time, a supra-partisan view should be taken to establish the authority of political reform of Parliament and eliminate fascists, so as not to be misguided by the process of political parties in power. This opinion is very powerful, and today a statement will be issued expressing a determination to handle it well. (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai leadership is paying close attention to the actions of the Datong Tuanjie faction, fearing that this faction will oppose the president, leading to a split in the party. At 3:00 PM today, the faction specially sent three people to visit Secretary-General Yamaguchi to explain the faction's claims, saying that they were based on Elder Tokonami's speech, aiming to establish party politics and having no other intentions. Secretary-General Yamaguchi requested the cancellation of the general meeting on the 27th, and the representatives asked Yamaguchi to allow them to convene a briefing. Seiyukai executives believe that the Datong faction has no conspiracy to overthrow the president, so the party's control will not be further disrupted. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's National Policy Renewal Association held a meeting last night at the San'en Pavilion in Shiba, attended by more than 30 people, including Tomihisa Nakajima. Nakajima is the president of Nakajima Aircraft Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and is very close to the military, taking war as an opportunity to make a fortune. Within the party, he and Yosuke Matsuoka belong to the same faction. After Matsuoka left the party, he remained in the party to fight against the anti-military faction, supporting the military's war policy, and is also deeply connected with the Kuhara faction. Last night, they secretly discussed reform strategies for party politics and national policy, confronting the Datong Tuanjie faction. The actions of the two factions are worth noting in the future.

<p>(Tokyo) Because Prime Minister Saito is ill and unable to attend Parliament, the House of Peers and the House of Representatives have asked the government to appoint a temporary prime minister representative. The government has internally decided that if the prime minister is still unable to attend the court by the 26th, the cabinet will appoint Finance Minister Takahashi as the prime minister representative to answer various matters in Parliament. (23rd Japan Federation Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because Prime Minister Saito's absence has suspended the general meeting of the House of Peers' Budget Committee, Budget Committee Chairman Hashizawa informally proposed to the government on the 22nd to seek appropriate measures. The government decided to have Finance Minister Takahashi act as prime minister to answer questions in order to proceed with parliamentary affairs during the prime minister's absence, requesting the understanding of the House of Peers. Each faction in the House of Peers expressed dissatisfaction, saying that if a prime minister representative is appointed, it should be discussed separately. If a superficial method of answering agent is adopted, it cannot be satisfied. The government's insincere handling of the House of Peers' genuine questions with such a method that has no legal authority has caused a sense of government negligence to permeate all factions in the House of Peers. (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito, who is currently ill in bed, had a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius this morning, having fully recovered to normal. Therefore, he will rest quietly this week, and hopes to attend the parliament from Monday next week. (23rd Dentsu News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kazumi Okamoto Investigative Committee will conclude after only two more sessions. At the next committee meeting on the 28th, Gengo Kuroe will be summoned. It is still unclear whether Minister Hatoyama will be summoned at the next meeting. When this issue was first exposed, Minseito, in order to attack the Seiyukai, forgot the tacit agreement to jointly uphold the authority of Parliament and asked quite bluntly about this matter. On the 22nd, the Ministry of Justice submitted the prosecutor's report, which contained the 100,000 yen incident of the late President Hamaguchi. Even if it is a collateral fact unrelated to the issue, it is no less than a blow to Minseito. As a result, it is feared that vigorous pursuit of this matter may cause unexpected problems. In addition, Okamoto and Kuroe's exposure tactics may further lose the authority of Parliament and the credibility of political parties. If the pursuit is continued, it will inevitably fall into their tactics. Therefore, Minseito's momentum in attacking this matter has been greatly reduced. On the one hand, the Kokumin Domei, due to the exposure of the late President Hamaguchi's 100,000 yen incident, also knows that it does not have the confidence of being clean and pure, and does not dare to pursue it. Therefore, the Investigative Committee will end with a whimper. Hatoyama's explanation of his personal situation is hoped to be made at the plenary session. If the Investigative Committee requests an explanation, it will be answered in writing. If Chairman Shimada reports the progress of the Investigative Committee at the plenary session, he will take the stage to give a formal explanation. (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Emperor is very pleased to have a crown prince and has specially designated four days from today to celebrate the birth of the crown prince. At 0:30 PM today, a banquet was held in the Fengming Hall of the palace for imperial relatives, the diplomatic corps stationed in Beijing, Privy Council advisors, cabinet ministers, and former officials with courtesy treatment. Prime Minister Saito was absent due to illness. Tokyo mobilized 50,000 female students citywide to congratulate the imperial palace. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Fishing Zone Dispute</h3>
<p>Giving a Chance to Japanese Hawks</p>
<p>Tokyo Reports Russia May Make Concessions</p>
<p>Arrested Russian Personnel to Be Released Soon</p>
<p>Talk of Reopening East Road Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Consul General Watanabe stationed in Vladivostok reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that in the fishing zone bidding on the 20th, Japan bid for a total of 84 zones, with the Japan-Russia Fisheries Company bidding for 74 zones, the Showa Industrial Company bidding for 9 zones, and another zone. Among these 84 zones, the Russian side competed with Japan-Russia Fisheries Company for 32 of the 74 zones it bid for, and with Showa Company for 4 of the 9 zones it bid for. Because the Russian side offered very high prices, all 36 zones fell into Russian hands. Among the other 48 zones, 10 should have been won by the Japanese. As a result, due to Russia's cancellation of the fishing zones, the Japanese side suffered a loss of 38 zones. However, the Japanese side believes that Russia's policy this time is a matter of life and death for Japan's North Pacific fishing rights, and that North Pacific fishing rights were obtained as a result of the Russo-Japanese War. Various right-wing groups want to use this issue to advocate war against Russia. The faction advocating re-war with Russia sees this as a rare opportunity and is strongly urging the government to take strong diplomatic action. This issue is gradually becoming a crucial key between Japan and Russia in deciding whether to make peace or war. (23rd Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday, reporting that he had received a telegram from his government acknowledging that the Japanese side's declaration of the invalidity of the fishing zone bidding was justified and would be corrected. The Foreign Minister strongly stated that Japan was determined to recognize the validity of Japan's bidding at the exchange rate of 2 jiao 2 fen 5 li per unit. The Soviet Russian ambassador agreed to convey Japan's claim to his government. Also, regarding the issue of the reinstatement of Soviet personnel on the East China Railway, the Soviet ambassador expressed his intention to accept the compromise plan negotiated by Foreign Minister Hirota. This is only a temporary appointment of Russian successors, and the Soviet Russian side has shown considerable concession. "Manchukuo" may be recognized, and East China Railway negotiations are expected to reopen. (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry told reporters that relations between Japan and Russia had improved. The Russian ambassador to Japan had submitted several conditions to the Japanese Foreign Minister regarding the arrest of six Russian personnel on the Middle East Road several months ago. These conditions are acceptable to the Japanese side, and the "Manchukuo" authorities will also accept them. The Russian ambassador had expressed hope for the resumption of the conference for the sale of the Middle East Road, which had been virtually suspended since the "strange documents" were published by the Moscow side. The spokesman concluded that the Russian authorities in Vladivostok should try to remedy the situation recently triggered by the declaration that the bidding by Japanese fishermen was invalid, as the Japanese merchants were based on the exchange rate of one ruble for 3 jiao 2 fen 5 li in Japanese currency.

<h3>French Budget Bill Passes House of Representatives in Full</h3>
<p>Authorizing Government to Implement Savings</p>
<p>New Cabinet Passes Difficult Hurdle Smoothly</p>
<p>(Paris) The life of Doumergue's new government has a good chance of being extended today, as the House of Representatives has passed the entire budget bill with a large majority of 469 to 123 votes. This bill was a vote on the whole, rather than a rejection of each item, so it was able to pass quickly. It is expected that the Senate will also pass it before the end of this month, allowing Prime Minister Doumergue to get his wish. The bill stipulates revenue of 48,477,000,000 francs and expenditure of 4,418,000,000 francs. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After listening to the statements of Prime Minister Doumergue and Finance Minister Germain-Martin, the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives passed a new clause with a majority of 18 votes to 8, authorizing the government to implement savings measures by means of "delegated legal orders," with the total amount of savings to be determined later. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party voted against it. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. Silver Policy</h3>
<p>(New York) According to highly reliable sources, Congress will not legislate to make the U.S. currency a bimetallic standard. The authorities' will remains strictly secret, but judging from the current situation, the government is currently confiscating silver and prohibiting exports and imports in accordance with the gold method, and will probably pay 5 jiao per ounce to deal with the current speculative supply to the government, or even increase the price of new mined silver until the ratio of gold to silver reaches 1 to 16. Then the government may issue silver certificates according to the amount of silver confiscated and allow these new silver certificates to be used to purchase cash silver. (22nd Guomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>Topeka Democratic Senator McGill spoke here today, advocating the use of gold and silver as the standard for the U.S. currency, saying that minting coins with silver would increase the price of silver, and that the purchasing power of silver-using countries in South America and the Far East would increase accordingly, and that it would be on par with the United States, so the United States' declining foreign trade would benefit greatly.

<h3>Belgium's New King Sworn In</h3>
<p>Leopold III Becomes the Fourth Monarch Since the Nation's Founding</p>
<p>Pledge to Abide by Constitution and Civil Law</p>
<p>To Uphold the Independence of the Nation</p>
<p>Brussels – New King Leopold III, escorted by troops, proceeded from the Laeken Palace to the Parliament this morning to take the oath of allegiance to the Constitution. The streets were lined with spectators, who cheered "Long live the new King!" Upon arriving at the Parliament, Leopold III, before members of both houses and the royal family, swore to uphold the Constitution and civil law, and to safeguard the nation's independence and territorial integrity. He then addressed the assembly, stating that he would emulate his ancestors in serving the country, strive for unity among all classes according to his father's intentions, and promote the development of the colonies. He also said that Belgium would continue to participate in peaceful endeavors. The new king first spoke in French, then repeated the speech in Flemish. He then withdrew amidst the cheers of the public, concluding the ceremony. Although the conflict in the Parliament last night and the pronouncements of the Flemish National Party and the Communist Party raised fears of disturbances today, the enthronement ceremony proceeded quietly, without incident. It is noted that the Flemish National Party claimed that the Belgian royal family had never taken any action to protect the special interests of the Flemish people, while the Communist Party stated that the death of the former King Albert was not entirely accidental. Upon hearing these statements, the assembly argued and even exchanged blows. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Brussels – When the new King stated in his address that he was determined to serve the country, the entire assembly rose to its feet and cheered enthusiastically. The new Queen was so moved that she shed tears. The funeral of the late King yesterday was delayed by half an hour to allow retired soldiers to pass by the King's coffin and pay their final respects. The public is now praising the new King's benevolence. Furthermore, the new King canceled the customary reception for the public in the capital on the day after the new monarch's enthronement. Instead, he drove through streets crowded with people for twelve miles, deeply moving the public. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Brussels – Crown Prince Leopold is scheduled to succeed his late father today as King, taking the title Leopold III, thus opening a new chapter in Belgian history. He is the fourth monarch since the founding of Belgium. Initially, Belgium was part of the Netherlands. In 1830, it declared its independence and formed an independent nation. In June of the following year, the first monarch ascended the throne.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM this morning (approximately 4:00 PM Shanghai time), all church bells will ring, and a 111-gun salute will be fired. An hour later, the Chief of Staff of the Army will pay respects to the new King outside the Laeken Palace. This will be followed by the renowned Mayor of Brussels, Max, and various councilors. Subsequently, the new King and Queen, along with the Queen Mother, will proceed to the Parliament by car. Afterward, another 111-gun salute will be fired. As the oath of enthronement is read, a third 111-gun salute will be fired, thus concluding the ceremony. Traditionally, on the day after the new monarch's enthronement, people from all directions would gather in the capital to express their love and support. Now, at the Crown Prince's request, this custom has been canceled. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Military Disarmament Discussions Show Full Understanding Between Britain and Germany</h3>
<p>Germany Claims No Desire to Rebuild Military</p>
<p>Raises Reservations on British Plan</p>
<p>Eden Completes Mission and Departs Germany for Italy</p>
<p>(Berlin) – The discussions on military disarmament between the British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden, and the German Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath, concluded today. This afternoon, the German authorities issued the following communiqué:</p>
<p>"The discussions between the British Lord Privy Seal, Lord Eden, and the German authorities regarding the issue of military disarmament have concluded today. Lord Eden had lengthy discussions with Chancellor Hitler twice, and also met with Foreign Minister Neurath several times. Both sides demonstrated a spirit of sincerity and friendship, and expressed the desire of both governments to reach a general agreement on this issue as soon as possible. Although the purpose of these discussions was not to reach a concrete agreement on the content of a disarmament treaty, the joint exploration has led to a full understanding of the issue. Therefore, it is felt that although there are still many obstacles on the road to concluding a disarmament treaty, some progress has been made."</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Hitler and Neurath repeatedly stated during the discussions that Germany had no desire to rebuild its military but maintained that Germany should be allowed to possess defensive weapons. If so, Germany would be willing to give up offensive weapons, and the same applies to aircraft. However, Hitler said that he would be willing to accept control and make the Brown Shirts non-military in nature, but other countries would also have to accept the same control. Germany is prepared to agree to a short-term military service of 300,000 militiamen and supports any disarmament plan that other countries are prepared to implement. Eden met with President Hindenburg today and is scheduled to depart for Rome tomorrow morning to hold talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and others, and then plans to visit Paris again to continue discussions with French Prime Minister Doumergue and others. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) – The visit of Mr. Eden to Germany to discuss disarmament issues with key German government officials has now come to an end. A semi-official political and diplomatic report here states that the outcome of the Anglo-German talks was "absolutely satisfactory." The report, from a semi-official German foreign ministry organ, states that "Mr. Eden's mission to Germany is now complete. Both sides have clarified their fundamental views on the issue of disarmament. The failure to reach a concrete agreement at this open and sincere meeting is not problematic, as Mr. Eden came here with a special mission from the British government. Although Germany has not unconditionally accepted the British plan in its entirety, and there are still differences of opinion on issues such as the air force and the duration of the disarmament agreement, these minor points are not of crucial importance. The final solution will have to wait until the draft treaty is submitted, and the interests and demands of the major powers are clarified before its feasibility can be determined. However, the most important result of Mr. Eden's negotiations is that the British Lord Privy Seal left Germany with a clear understanding of the new German state, namely, that the path followed by the new Germany will not endanger world peace, nor will it leave the now heavily armed nations unable to disarm themselves. Mr. Eden has a very clear understanding of the German government's objective, which is merely to create a preliminary position of security and equality for Germany. However, fundamental differences of opinion continue to exist today, and the time is not yet ripe for a disarmament conference or a mediation meeting, as any meeting would be futile if the final goals are not aligned. It is hoped that Mr. Eden will gather more information on his trip to Italy, and that a decision will be made when he returns to Paris." (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) – After spending three days in Berlin to complete his mission, the British Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Eden, departed for Rome this morning. The British Ambassador and key German government officials saw him off at the station. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) – Rumors of the situation surrounding Eden's talks in Berlin have made people somewhat optimistic about the current situation. People here are taking a reserved attitude towards this news. Generally speaking, Germany may accept certain points of the British memorandum but has attached some conditions, and if these conditions are accommodated, it would be enough to greatly alter the British memorandum. The extent to which Germany's proposals can be adopted will have to await Eden's return home and a decision by the Cabinet. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy, Austria, and Hungary Join Hands</h3>
<p>To Adopt a Unified Approach in Diplomacy</p>
<p>In Opposition to the Little Entente</p>
<p>Budapest – In order to counter the Little Entente, Italy, Austria, and Hungary have resolved to cooperate closely in diplomacy and take a unified approach to international affairs. An agreement is about to be drafted and is expected to be signed soon. This decision was made during talks between Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich and Hungarian authorities. The new agreement on a unified diplomatic policy among Italy, Austria, and Hungary is expected to have a far-reaching impact on the current international situation. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The Morning Post commented on the plan for Italy to join forces with Austria and Hungary to form a Danube League, saying that Italy's policy towards Austria seems excessive. Italy clearly intends to combine Austria and Hungary into a solid bloc, which it will control. This move, regardless of its economic nature, has significant political implications. This bloc aims to counter the Little Entente, which will not only fail to eliminate existing dangers but will also exacerbate them. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Revenge Marchers Set Off for London</h3>
<p>Singing Revolutionary Songs Along the Way</p>
<p>Opposing the "Means Test"</p>
<p>Police Authorities Prepare for Precautions</p>
<p>(London) – The so-called "Revenge Marchers" are expected to arrive in London at the end of this week. As a preventative measure, the police authorities are recruiting temporary police to maintain order. Currently, 20,000 civilians have responded to the call, and it is expected that at least 10,000 will be assigned to patrol duties, most of whom will be stationed in Hyde Park. Stores around Hyde Park are now taking special precautions to protect their property. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) – Today, 2,000 unemployed people set off from various parts of Britain for London, singing along the way, "When the time of revolution arrives, we will hang MacDonald on the sour apple tree." This march is organized by the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party and will hold a demonstration in Hyde Park on Monday of next week. This march is different from the hunger march of December 1932. Its purpose is to oppose the police oppression, forced labor, and various other aspects of the unemployment issue. What they resent most is the so-called "means test," which forces those receiving unemployment benefits to prove that they have no means of making a living. They all point out that this regulation is tantamount to swearing an oath of poverty. The marchers, both men and women, are selected for their physical strength and ability to withstand the elements. They all carry cooking utensils and other items. The London police authorities are now taking all precautions to avoid a riot like the previous march. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Nicaraguan Revolutionary Leader Sandino Assassinated</h3>
<p>Perpetrated by Members of the National Guard</p>
<p>Fears of Civil War Arise</p>
<p>National Martial Law Declared</p>
<p>Managua – General Sandino, the leader of the 1932 revolution in Nicaragua, Central America, was assassinated last night outside the city. His brother Socrates and Generals Estrada and others were also killed. Sandino came to the capital to discuss the future of the Nicaraguan National Guard with Nicaraguan President Sacasa. Sandino would dismiss his own troops, on the condition the National Guard would be reorganized. The President had strictly ordered his subordinates to protect Sandino and others' safety while they were in the capital, but these orders were not followed, and Sandino and others were brutally murdered. The President was furious and ordered an immediate investigation and asked the Congress to provide facilities for maintaining public order. Sandino's followers will undoubtedly be resentful upon hearing this tragic news, and it is feared that Nicaragua will once again descend into civil war. The murderers have not yet been apprehended, but there is no doubt that the incident was perpetrated by members of the National Guard. The President has now ordered that all correspondence be subject to strict censorship. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Managua – Since the assassination of General Sandino, leader of the Revolutionary Party, martial law has been declared throughout the country. General Sandino, along with Generals Estrada and Umanzor, were returning after having dinner with the President when soldiers of the National Guard blocked the road and forced the three onto a truck, driving them to the airfield, where they were stood up and shot to death with machine guns. Soon after, Sandino's brother Socrates also suffered the same fate. It is said that President Sacasa was not involved in this atrocity, as he had always shown great respect for General Sandino.

<h3>South Irish Parliament Passes Law Banning Blue Shirts</h3>
<p>Unexpected by Opposition Parties</p>
<p>Raucous Scene in Parliament</p>
<p>Dublin – The South Irish Parliament today passed the first reading of the law banning the wearing of blue shirts by a vote of 65 to 40. The introduction of the bill for the first reading was unexpected by the opposition parties, causing a great uproar. Although the bill does not specifically mention General O'Duffy's Blue Shirt Army, its purpose is undoubtedly to ban the group. The bill is titled "Law Banning the Wearing or Carrying of Uniforms, Armbands, Insignia, etc." When Minister of Justice Ruttledge introduced the bill, he stated that the government believed that previous breaches of peace were related to militarization and politics. The bill aims to end this kind of evil and maintain peace and order. The assembly responded with jeers. Then, Dr. Walshingtons (whose brother was murdered while serving as an administrator in the Cosgrave government) rose to say that this bill was purely political in nature and was intended to subject those who dared to oppose the head of administration to legal punishment. At this, the crowd shouted wildly, and several members of De Valera's party rose up and angrily denounced it. The Speaker then intervened to restore order to the meeting and passed the first reading of the bill. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Plans to Reroute the Nankou-Kangzhuang Section of the PingSui Railway</h3>

It has been decided that 100,000 yuan will be allocated monthly from the railway's income for the next four years, raising half of the amount, with the remaining half being subsidized by the Ministry of Railways.

<h3>Strange Phenomenon of Japanese Party Politics (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Bribery Problems Lead to Party Split</p>
<p>Since the opening of the 65th session of the Japanese Diet, Araki resigned due to internal control issues. As a result, the power of political parties seemed to rise, and constitutional politics seemed to have a chance to revive. However, in the midst of this, two noteworthy problems have arisen. The first is that the Minister of Education, Hatoyama Ichiro, received a bribe of 50,000 yen from brokering the sale of two stocks: the merchant Kokujin artificial silk and Kobe Steel. This has now been exposed in the Diet by Okamoto Ikki. The second is the split in the Seiyukai party, resulting from the first problem, with Tokonami Takejiro and Kuhara Fusanosuke colluding to make things difficult for Hatoyama, forcing him to resign, and creating a foundation for the cabinet's downfall.</p>
<p>Originally, Japanese parliamentary politics only nominally corresponded to reality during the Hara Takashi cabinet era. At that time, the European war had just ended, and the general public was eager for peaceful construction, so the zaibatsu were able to profit, and party politics got on the right track. However, since the outbreak of the world economic crisis, the advocacy of militarism has gradually risen. In particular, after Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in office on May 15 of the previous year, constitutional politics existed only in name, and all politics were secretly controlled by the military. The general public no longer trusts the Diet, or at least is indifferent to it. However, blind military action cannot solve the current economic difficulties, nor can it overcome the political contradictions within Japan. Therefore, the credibility of the military remains merely nominal and still contradicts the demands of the public.</p>
<p>The most notable example is the issue of the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Private shareholders inevitably became panicked, and the two major political parties that relied on the Manchukuo Railway for revolving funds also felt threatened, fearing that they would be subject to great restrictions in the future and would have to completely obey the military. Therefore, when the 65th Diet session resumed after the recess, it began to attack the military to show the position of the political parties and to try to reverse the decline of the parties. However, before this issue had been formally resolved, a very serious problem arose between the Diet and the Saito cabinet. In terms of the development of the Japanese political situation, the Saito cabinet lacked real stability. Although Saito was a senior member of the naval clique and had gained the sympathy of the military, the two parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, still had some disagreements and often clashed. The budget proposal for the next year was only established after great effort within the cabinet, but a major storm in the Diet arose even before the budget proposal was passed.</p>
<p>This storm originated from a speech by Diet member Okamoto Ikki, exposing the government's ugliness, saying that Minister of Education Hatoyama Ichiro had received a bribe of 50,000 yen. As a result of the investigation by Minister of Justice Oyama, it was stated that (1) Hatoyama Ichiro did not have any hesitation about being prosecuted, (2) receiving 50,000 yen from Karafuto Kogyo was not based on facts, (3) in the past, there was a donation of 50,000 yen for election expenses between Ohkawa Heizaburo, president of the Karafuto (i.e., southern Sakhalin) Kogyo Company, and Hatoyama Ichiro, but it was purely a personal donation and did not constitute a crime at all. From the government's perspective alone, and in terms of the surface of the law, Hatoyama's reputation and the cabinet's credibility were probably not a problem and were temporarily preserved.</p>
<p>However, another problem arose, namely that Okamoto was suspected of fabricating facts, so Okamoto was ordered to be investigated to thoroughly investigate the matter. In fact, Okamoto's accusation of Hatoyama's bribery was not a simple personal action, but contained a very serious political meaning, namely that there were people within the Seiyukai who agreed with Okamoto and were engaged in a movement to overthrow the cabinet and split the party. The Seiyukai's executives believed that Okamoto's fabrication of facts was detrimental to him personally, and even more detrimental to the party, causing the credibility of parliamentary politics to be fundamentally lost. Therefore, they wanted to thoroughly investigate, and if any party members colluded with him, they would be punished with expulsion for disrupting party discipline. However, Tokonami Takejiro, among the elder statesmen, advocated caution, while Kuhara Fusanosuke secretly supported Okamoto and contacted the Minseito, Kokumin Domei, and other neutral factions to engage in the movement to overthrow the cabinet.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai split once after the death of Hara Takashi. After Inukai was assassinated, Suzuki succeeded as president, forming a situation of various factions vying for power. Among the potential successors to the presidency, Tokonami was among the elder statesmen, Kuhara was considered a zaibatsu, and Hatoyama Ichiro was the leading young politician. Moreover, Hatoyama was related to Suzuki Saburo by marriage and was currently a state minister, so it was very convenient for him to proceed. Therefore, the Kuhara faction and the Tokonami faction were even more determined to unite and attack him. As a result, the internal conflicts of the Seiyukai became even more severe. If it truly split, the remaining members of the Seiyukai might be reduced to around a hundred. (February 17, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Speaks on Sino-Soviet Relations in Peiping</h3>
<p>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations is the First Paragraph of the Article</p>
<p>The Future of Diplomacy Depends on Oneself</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence, Peiping Diplomatic Monthly, yesterday (20th) evening, welcomed Ambassador Yan Huiqing at the European and American Alumni Association and invited prominent figures from all walks of life to accompany him. After a simple meal, Ambassador Yan gave a speech at 8 PM on Sino-Soviet relations and the situation in the Far East. Yan first recounted the negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in Geneva to resume diplomatic relations. The secrecy and speed of this matter had been known to the world and need not be repeated. However, when Litvinov arrived in Geneva, diplomatic circles widely rumored that Litvinov would sign an important agreement with a certain country, and the atmosphere was quite tense. When the exchange of texts for the resumption of diplomatic relations was announced, the so-called important agreement was not with a certain country but with China, which surprised everyone. Yan said that although our country is weak, we should not underestimate ourselves too much. He recalled that when China severed relations with Germany in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the severance note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was delivered to the German embassy by his brother. The Germans knew that China could not send a single soldier to participate in the war, nor could it send a single warship to Europe, but the German minister's face immediately changed when he saw the note, because China had such a large territory and 400 million people. These 400 million people said that Germany was wrong and joined the front line against it, which was terrible. The significance of the Soviet Union's resumption of diplomatic relations with China this time is the same. It would be unfavorable for the Soviet Union to be enemies with 400 million people. The resumption of diplomatic relations is only the first paragraph of the article. How the subsequent articles will be written, after the resumption of diplomatic relations, there was a widespread rumor in the country that economic investigation teams and industrial investigation teams would go to Russia, but later there was no news. He had repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge this matter, and now he still hopes that the people of the country will realize this matter. When the United States and Russia resumed diplomatic relations this time, he met the American ambassador in Paris, who had as many as eighty staff members, most of whom were handling commercial affairs. The Non-Aggression Pact stipulates that force cannot be used as a tool of aggression. The Soviet Union's foreign trade, buying and selling, are all state-run, and the power is very great. Whoever treats me well, I will buy their goods; whoever treats me badly, I will not buy their goods, manipulating it as desired. In foreign actions, it is no less than military force. Now American merchants are forming large groups, increasing their power, so that they are a qualified enemy to the Soviet Union's state-run trade. This point is also something that the people of the country should pay attention to. For example, tea has always been a major export to Russia. Tea merchants should now unite to form a large group. Next, he talked about the outline of the Middle East Road issue, saying that Sino-Soviet relations, in addition to the Northeast, also involve Xinjiang in the Northwest. Russia originally had the Siberian Railway, and also built a Turkestan-Siberia Railway along the Xinjiang border. Originally, there were only two roads for our country to enter Xinjiang. Now, because of the civil war, the road to the east is blocked, and only the road to the Soviet Union is accessible, so the economic power of Xinjiang Province is entirely in the hands of the Soviet Union. If they want to sell at a high price, the people of Xinjiang have nothing else to replace Russian goods. If they want to buy cheaply, the people of Xinjiang have no other place to sell their goods. Everything is manipulated by others. Therefore, from an economic point of view, Xinjiang is already in the pocket of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union currently has no territorial desires for Xinjiang, because from an economic point of view, there is no need to occupy land, and it is also beneficial to consolidate the Han Chinese regime, because if the Han Chinese lose power, the Hui people will rise up, and the Hui people are not unified, and disputes will inevitably arise, which will lead to the activities of Siberia and the Hui people, making the Soviet Union internally uneasy. As for the future of diplomacy, it depends entirely on oneself. If one works hard, everything is hopeful; if one does not work hard, there is no way to do anything. On the one hand, the Southern Xinjiang Organization's Pseudo-Government Photography The three pieces of this film were taken after Usman left, when the turban-wearing people carried out the rebellion and organized the pseudo-government, and when they held a ceremony outside the city of Shufu to raise the pseudo-new national flag (the flag is green) in imitation of the Turkish style.

<p>12. High school teacher, Arab (name unknown)</p>
<p>Speaking of it, nothing in China is unrelated to diplomacy. Financial management and governance all have foreign relations. But on the other hand, everything is unrelated to diplomacy. Without internal affairs, there is no diplomacy. Without improving internal affairs, there is nothing to do in diplomacy. Yan mentioned his feelings about the League of Nations, saying that the Chinese nation has always advocated peace, so in the future it must still focus on peace. China will support all institutions that maintain peace, but at the same time, it must also promote the spirit of martial arts among the people and prepare for military force, not to attack others, but to resist. Finally, he said that the national concept of the general public is weak, which is the biggest crisis in China. Therefore, he hopes that the people of the country will have a deep national concept. Yan's speech lasted for an hour. Finally, there was a free question and answer session, and everyone dispersed in joy. (21st)</p>

The entire case of male and female criminals was taken by the British Municipal Council for investigation. This morning, they have been extradited across the border by the Public Security Bureau. Because the case is serious, they will be sent to the Beiping Military Branch for interrogation after the fugitives are captured. The process of uncovering this case is that in December of last year, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau received a tip that dozens of assassins dispatched from a certain country had sneaked into Tianjin, plotting to assassinate Chinese authorities and plunge the security into chaos, so that traitors and others could take the opportunity to make trouble. A few days later, a bombing incident suddenly occurred at the Public Security Bureau. The provincial, municipal, and police authorities believed that the tip was true, and ordered the Second Team of the Public Security Bureau's Special Task Force to be responsible for tracking the case in order to crack it. After more than a month, the Special Task Force had obtained clues, knowing that the assassination group was located on a certain street in a certain country's concession. Because of the protection of a certain country's forces, it was difficult to arrest them. Therefore, two police officers from the team tried to contact Ma Dianchen, the leader of the group. Ma was from Baoding, Hebei, and committed all kinds of evil. He had set up a Sumin Hospital in Tianjin, posing as the dean, but secretly doing some lawless things. A few months ago, he joined the pseudo-state and was introduced by someone to become the leader of this assassination group. The expenses and weapons were all transferred by a certain country. The condition was to kill Ma Zhanshan and be rewarded with 100,000 yuan, and to kill a certain important figure in Hebei and be rewarded with 320,000 yuan or so. After Ma Dianchen was ordered, he and his accomplices urgently sought ways to get started. Every day, he ordered his party members to disguise themselves as beggars or rickshaw pullers, patrolling in front of Ma Zhanshan's residence on No. 46 Road, intending to take the opportunity to strike. However, since Ma Zhanshan lived in the British Concession, he did not ask about the world and lived a secluded life. These people waited for an opportunity for many days but could not get started. However, they still ordered a party member every day to pretend to be a rickshaw puller, parking in front of Ma's residence to scout for news. In late February, Ma wanted to go to the Yuanxingchi bathhouse on Zhangzhuang Bridge on the border between France and England to bathe, and he had a car waiting in front of Yuanxingchi, intending to wait until Ma arrived and shoot him to death with guns. Unexpectedly, Ma had not gone for a long time due to illness. The party's plan was still not sold. The undercover Special Task Force member saw that the party was anxious and had no way to get started, so he took the opportunity to suggest that they move to the neighboring building on the back street of Ma's residence, and wait for a convenient time to act at night. Ma Dianchen thought it was true, so the Special Task Force member found a building on the back street of Ma's residence, which happened to be back-to-back with Ma's residence. After the party got the house, they decided to move in on the afternoon of the 18th. To avoid attracting the attention of foreigners, they hung up a wooden sign for an English Research Institute and planned to climb over Ma's building at about 4 AM on the 19th and throw hand-slipped grenades and box cannons at Ma's bedroom. After success, they planned to be picked up by a certain country's car to a certain boundary. The Special Task Force member learned the content and secretly reported it to the team headquarters. The team leader then asked the Public Security Bureau Director Ning Xiangnan to secretly notify Ma Zhanshan to pay attention and be vigilant. At about 5 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, the police officers of the Special Task Force were disguised and ambushed in the vicinity of No. 46 and No. 45. Some team members were disguised as rickshaw pullers, and some were disguised as electricians, all with hidden weapons to prevent the party from acting. At 5:30 PM, the first batch of party members came and were immediately captured in the rented house. By about 7 PM, five men and women had been captured. The leader, Ma Dianchen, was extremely cautious in his actions. He watched the wind from dozens of steps behind his first, second, and third batches of accomplices, and did not rush forward. When he passed the Waiqiang Bridge, he saw that there seemed to be movements ahead and was about to escape, but he was seen by the Special Task Force member ambushed by the bridge, who rushed out and hugged him. In a moment of urgency, Ma pulled out his gun and fired a shot, but unexpectedly hit himself in the side. He immediately fell to the ground. A patrolman from the British Concession caught a glimpse, went to inquire, and realized that it was the Public Security Bureau's Special Task Force handling a case. He told the police station to take the group of accomplices away. Ma Dianchen was immediately sent to the hospital. On the morning of the 19th, he died of excessive bleeding. The names of the remaining four men and one woman are Zheng Yufu, Gao Lishi, Wang Chengyun, He Yuqing, and Xue Xiancai, all in their twenties. Gao Lishi is only nineteen years old. After being arrested, hand-slipped grenades and other items were found in her trousers. The four male criminals were also equipped with pistols. Later, the Industrial Bureau cooperated with the Special Task Force to search the party's residence and found seven pistols, three hand-slips, six hundred bullets, and one portable machine gun. Ning Xiangnan has rewarded the Special Task Force with 200 yuan for their efforts in handling this case, and has ordered them to do their best to capture their remaining accomplices. It is said that there are a total of eleven people in the party responsible for the assassination of Ma Zhanshan. In addition to those who have been captured and killed, there are still five fugitives, all hiding in a certain country's concession. Ma Zhanshan has become even more reclusive because someone has harmed him. (20th)</p>
<h3>Zhou Dynasty Coins Discovered in Rizhao County, Shandong</h3>
<p>Sufficient for Studying the History of Ancient Overseas Trade</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, There are many ancient ruins in the coastal areas of Rizhao and Ju County in southeastern Shandong. Recently, a pottery jar of Zhou Dynasty coins, still connected and intact, was discovered in Donghaiyu Village, Rizhao County. It is said that the Provincial Library has sent personnel to purchase them from the villagers for research. According to Curator Wang Xiantang, the coastal area of Rizhao and Ju County was the land of the Li Yi during the Zhou Dynasty. At that time, commerce was prosperous, and there was already overseas trade. The bone coins unearthed in Donghai Village, Rizhao County, are indeed from the Western Zhou Dynasty. The museum will send personnel to purchase them in order to study the ancient currency system. Liang Siyong of the Institute of Historical and Philology of Academia Sinica will come to Jinan and then go to the coastal area of Rizhao and Ju County for archaeology. The purpose of his archaeology is to investigate the history of ancient overseas trade. He himself also intends to go to Qufu, Jining, Tengzhou, and Zou County to investigate the ruins and relics of the Zhou and Han dynasties for historical exploration. Because Tengzhou, Zou County, Qufu, and other counties were the states of the princes during the Zhou Dynasty, and many were the capitals of kings and marquises during the Han Dynasty, they are indeed a treasure trove of antiquities. Therefore, the scope of the investigation is predetermined to be there. (21st)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Anhui Bank Closes</h3>
<p>All Commercial Activities are Unprofitable</p>
<p>Many Shops are Closing, Leading to Widespread Unemployment</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence, Commercial activity in Wuhu has shown signs of steep decline after the Lunar New Year. The only financial institution in Anhui, Wuhu Anhui Bank, unexpectedly announced yesterday (20th) that it would cease to accept deposits and withdrawals. The bank was founded in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 700,000 yuan. In recent years, it has lent out too many loans, such as more than 100,000 to the Electric Light Company, 60,000 to Zhang Hengchun Pharmacy, and several tens of thousands to a certain flour mill, which are all difficult to recover in a short period of time, and it feels that the turnover is not working. Although the branches in Shanghai and Tianjin Road, and the offices in inland Anhui such as Xuancheng, have good business, they have all been ordered to suspend business due to the relationship with the head office. The head office has also scheduled a shareholders' meeting on March 5 to make a final decision, but it is generally expected that the chances of resuming business are slim. The method for depositors and savers will also have to wait for the shareholders' meeting on March 5 to decide. It is said that there may not be a problem with a small number of sporadic savings. In addition, in terms of Qianzhuang, yesterday's values ​​were up to seven. Only a few companies, such as Yuankang, were listed, and most of them were merely show. The fact that Qianzhuang's business model is out of step with the times is a major reason, but it is also caused by the overall market decline. In Wuhu Port last year, all commercial activities were unprofitable. The authorities of various industries this year are looking at the future and cannot help but feel apprehensive. In order to survive, they have to try to tighten up. Therefore, in the past two days, the number of shop assistants who have been laid off has reached one thousand and several hundred, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, and even more people are affected by their lives. This is really the biggest problem facing the current society, and it should not be ignored. (21st)</p>

<h3>Kong, Xiao, and Gao Three Bands Wander in Northern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The West Route Army is Besieging and Suppressing in Wuning</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Xiao Ke's 17th Division of the pseudo-Jiangxi-Hunan Military Region's 8th Army, after fleeing north to Yifeng, joined forces with Kong Hechong's pseudo-16th Army of the Jiangxi-Hubei Military Region's pseudo-6th Army Group and Gao Yongsheng's band. From Fengxin, 120 li from the province, they turned west and occupied Ganfang and Hanjiaobu. Because the West Route Army's Zhu Yaohua and other units bravely attacked, and the air force stationed in the province continued to bomb, the two bandits fled from Fengxin into Jing'an before the Lunar New Year last year, occupying the area bordering Jiuxiantang Hegang between Fengxin and Jing'an, and the area bordering Tonggu between Xiushui and Wuning. They stubbornly resisted the National Army. At that time, Chairman Chiang, in addition to ordering the West Route Third Column Yue Sen and other units to go east from northern Jiangxi to block them, also ordered Zhu Yaohua and other units of the Second Column Liu Yinggu to divide into six detachments and track down and pursue the bandits from Yifeng, Xiushui, and Fengxin, taking the form of a pincer attack. Xiao and Gao fled into Wuning due to insecurity, and joined forces with the remnants of Kong Hechong's band who had entered Xiushui from Wanzai, attempting to bypass Jiugong Mountain and Dawu Mountain, their old nest, via the border between Hubei and Jiangxi via the north bank of Xiushui. According to front-line news, the four bands of Kong, Xiao, Gao, and Li, totaling about five to six thousand people, have crossed the Xiushui River and are being surrounded by the various units of the 18th Division and the 50th Army in Wuning. Several aircraft from the air force stationed in the province and the West Route Army stationed in Pingxiang and Wanzai went to bomb. The various units of the National Army also surrounded them separately, taking this opportunity to wipe them out. (February 18th)</p>
<h3>Current Financial Situation in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Tax Revenues Plummet Across the Board</p>
<p>Abolition of Lunar New Year Customs Leads to Financial Stagnation</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the suppression of the Fujian Incident, everything is in need of restoration. The financial problem should be solved first. Provincial Chairman Chen Yi and the provincial committee members have just arrived in the provincial capital and have already begun to discuss this. Therefore, the first step is to reduce administrative expenses, and the second is to act according to ability and give the people a chance to rest. Among the civilian losses during the Fujian Incident, Minhou, Nanping, Gutian, and other counties suffered the most, followed by Putian, Fuqing, Xianyou, Jinjiang, Hui'an, Longxi, and other counties. The provincial government has already ordered the county magistrates of these counties to investigate the situation in detail and report back in order to coordinate relief measures. Sun Jiazhe, the provincial committee member and concurrently director of the finance department, has not yet arrived in Fujian. Before Sun's arrival, the financial responsibilities are temporarily maintained by Xu Fu of the provincial committee. It is said that Xu stated to Provincial Chairman Chen Yi that he can only be responsible for one month.</p>
<p>Among the revenues, besides the various taxes collected by the Special Finance Office, the funds remitted by various counties, and the 300,000 borrowed from the Chamber of Commerce, with tens of thousands already paid, the total revenue is more than 200,000 yuan. The central government also remitted 500,000 yuan, so all agencies were able to receive ten days of February's expenses two days before the Lunar New Year's Eve. The education funds, being directly allocated by the central government, were able to receive 50%. As for the military expenses for various national armies and the temporary expenses for expanding the airfield, etc., they are also directly allocated by the central government, so fundraising is not too difficult. Although Fujian Province's finances have always been known to be difficult, when Fan Qiwu was in charge of finance, the monthly income was about 500,000 yuan, and the expenditure was about 600,000 yuan. Income and expenditure could barely offset each other. If it could be sorted out in order, it could gradually enter a bright future. Unfortunately, the pseudo-government disrupted it once, implementing a policy of draining the pond to catch all the fish. The land and grain taxes in various places were all borrowed and advanced in advance. Even various donation taxes, trust funds, public accumulation funds of various agencies, and aircraft donations that had not yet been remitted were all used. Now that the rebellion has been quelled, the wounds have not yet healed. All the various tax revenues, for various reasons, have plummeted, which cannot be restored to normal in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The business community in Fuzhou has not yet broken away from the old habits, and still considers the Lunar New Year's Eve as the general liquidation period for settling accounts. However, this year, the rebellion has just been quelled, and the business of various businesses has completely stagnated. Therefore, for this general settlement period, except for a few extremely reliable ones, all are determined to collect debts but not repay them. Medium and small-sized shops have completely stopped repaying term payments. Banks and money shops have had no choice but to announce the rollover of terms and exchange of notes, and specially licensed merchants plan to raise funds after the Lunar New Year. Therefore, although the business situation is not good, there are no major changes. (February 16)</p>

<h3>Italian Aviator Hopes for Development of Aviation in China</h3>
<p>Tea Reception for the Press Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Detailed Account of Italy's Aviation Development</p>
<p>About to Go to Beijing to Meet with Chinese Authorities</p>
<p>Italian aviation celebrity Colonel Peinatti, to promote civil aviation development in China, piloted a two-winged light trainer aircraft at the Hongqiao Airport on the 18th of this month, performing various flight techniques, which was highly praised by all sectors. Mr. Pei then held a tea reception for the press in the lobby of the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund at 4 p.m. yesterday, discussing various aviation businesses. More than twenty reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers attended. The details of the conversation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Hope for Development of Aviation in China</h3>
<p>Mr. Pei first stated that the Italian government and people have great sympathy for China. When he was in Italy, he had conversations with Zhang Xueliang, the Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces, and others, and felt that China's future prospects were extremely promising. Since he came to China for observation this time, he has seen that the highest officials in China use airplanes for all their movements, which shows that the authorities are actively promoting the development of aviation. China has a vast land and abundant resources, and should engage in the development of civil aviation as soon as possible. It will be more convenient for China to develop aviation at this time, because in recent years, European and American countries have developed aviation quite well, and all their developments have detailed plans for China to adopt and implement. He also hopes that China will actively cultivate pilot talents to make them universal.</p>
<h3>Developed Aviation in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Mr. Pei also said that Italy's aviation industry, after the European War, was almost left behind due to the impact of the post-war period. Later, Prime Minister Mussolini concentrated forces from all sides and actively engaged in development, not only restoring the original state, but also making more progress than before. As for the aircraft used, all aircraft that have exceeded 2,000 hours of flight time are rebuilt, so the flight is safer. Furthermore, he has visited aircraft factories in various countries and felt that the aviation industry in all countries is making rapid progress, especially the Russian aircraft factory, which is large in scale and the best in the world, and its productivity is also very large.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Visit Authorities in Beijing</h3>
<p>Mr. Pei continued that after he came to China, he once went to Hangzhou to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but it was entirely a courtesy visit, and the development of aviation and other issues were not mentioned. Recently, according to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek intends to meet with him again to discuss aviation in concrete terms. He also plans to go to Beijing in the near future to visit the government authorities, and also intends to travel to Beiping once.</p>
<h3>Another Performance Before Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Pei finally said that he was honored to be welcomed by all sectors during this visit to China. He was very grateful for the praise given by all sectors and newspapers for the performance at Hongqiao. He will soon return to his country, but will come to China again in a month or two. The most pleasant thing about this visit to China is that he has many Chinese friends in less than a month, which he is very happy about. In order to repay the kindness of all sectors and promote aviation in general, he decided to give another performance before leaving Shanghai to return to his country.</p>
<h3>Britain Purchases Night-Flying Aircraft from Italy</h3>
<p>After Mr. Pei finished his report, someone asked whether it was true that China had recently ordered a large number of aircraft from Italy for the development of civil aviation. Mr. Pei replied that this was not true. However, he knew that China had recently purchased a night-flying aircraft from Italy, which was worth about 7,000 Italian gold coins.</p>

Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Yu Ming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have prepared a special boat and will go to welcome him at that time.</p>
<h3>Belgian Envoy to Arrive Tonight</h3>

<p>Belgian Minister to China, Mr. Auguste de Bassompierre, held a meeting in Beiping the day before yesterday (the 22nd) to commemorate the death of King Albert I of Belgium, inviting leaders from China and foreign countries.

<h3>Japanese Envoy Arichi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul General and Others Welcomed Him</p>
<p>Arichi Decides to Return to His Country for a Trip</p>

<h3>Important Remarks by Kong Xiangxi After Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Personal Inconvenience to Comment on the U.S. Raising Silver Prices</p>
<p>Issuance of Securities by Silver Syndicate Should Be Within the Scope of the Contract</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. yesterday after taking the overnight train from Beijing the night before last at 11:00 p.m., and went straight back to his private residence on West End Road to rest. Then, at 11:00 a.m., he met with reporters from various newspapers and went to work at the Central Bank at noon. The remarks of Mr. Kong are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>U.S. Raising Silver Prices</h3>
<p>The Chinese government and banking community attach great importance to the U.S.'s imminent implementation of raising silver prices. When Mr. Kong met with reporters, he focused his conversation on this issue. The reporter first asked Mr. Kong for his opinion on the U.S. raising silver prices. According to Mr. Kong, the Central Government attaches great importance to the U.S. raising silver prices and is currently studying it. Before the Central Government's opinion has been determined, he, as the Minister of Finance, is not in a position to express any opinion. As for his personal opinion on this issue, he is also unwilling to express it, for fear of causing market turmoil. The reporter then asked Mr. Kong about the Central Government's opinion on temporarily approving the Eight-Nation Silver Agreement and prohibiting the export of silver. Mr. Kong replied that the Shanghai banking community's request to temporarily approve the Eight-Nation Silver Agreement is under consideration by the Central Government. As for whether the export of silver will be prohibited in the future, it is not yet time to talk about it. Finally, the reporter urged Mr. Kong to express his personal opinion on the Shanghai banking community's opposition to the U.S. raising silver prices. Mr. Kong smiled and said that he, even in his personal capacity, is not in a position to express it. The banking community's claim is to express the opinion of the association, and he is really not in a position to express his approval or disapproval before the government's policy is announced.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silver Syndicate Issues Securities</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously used the Boxer Indemnity returned by Italy as collateral to borrow 44 million yuan from the Silver Syndicate organized by sixteen banks, including the Central, China, and Communications Banks. The Silver Syndicate has now decided to issue 30 million yuan in securities with this loan as collateral. When reporters met with Mr. Kong yesterday morning, they asked whether the Ministry of Finance had approved this move. Mr. Kong replied that the Shanghai Silver Syndicate's issuance of securities is acceptable as long as it is handled within the scope of the loan contract.</p>
<h3>Modification of the Cotton-Wheat Loan Contract</h3>
<p>The reporter also asked Mr. Kong about the outcome of canceling or modifying the U.S. cotton-wheat loan contract. Mr. Kong said that due to the sluggish domestic market, U.S. cotton and wheat that have already been shipped cannot continue to be purchased according to the original quota, and the original contract will inevitably be modified. Wei Wenbin, who is responsible for this matter in the United States, is currently consulting with the U.S. side on the modification. As for how to modify it and to what extent it has progressed, neither the U.S. side has announced it, nor is it convenient for our side to express it temporarily. It will be announced at an appropriate time.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Discuss Raising Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Banking Leaders Visited Kong Yesterday for Consultation</p>
<p>American Chamber of Commerce in China Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss</p>
<p>After the U.S. government implemented raising silver prices, the banking industry in this port telegraphed Roosevelt on the 20th to express its protest. Roosevelt has not yet responded. The American Chamber of Commerce in China also held an emergency meeting in this city yesterday to express its attitude. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, was visited by banking leaders in the afternoon for important consultations. The news from all sides is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Observations of the Shanghai Banking Community</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that since U.S. President Roosevelt is about to implement the policy of recoining silver coins to raise the price of silver and stimulate the purchasing power of various silver-using countries to increase exports, the banking community in this port believes that this move is deeply detrimental to China's economic position. It telegraphed Roosevelt on the 20th to request consideration and to request the Ministry of Finance to temporarily approve the Silver Agreement. As of last night, neither telegram had received a reply. Yesterday, Xin Sheng News Agency reporters interviewed important figures in the banking community. According to their observations, the main purpose of the U.S. policy of raising silver prices is to raise the price of its own silver production, promote the recovery plan, and stimulate the purchasing power of general silver-using and silver-producing countries. Whether it can be changed due to China's one-page telegram is unlikely. Although some people say that after the silver price rises, the amount of foreign debt repayments can be reduced, and the power to purchase necessary tools for developing resources, such as machinery, can be increased, which is not without benefit to our country, but it is very small compared to the losses in trade. In the future, in order to prevent excessive outflow of silver, our country will inevitably levy a silver export tax to compensate. The following are the figures for the relevant gold and silver ratio items in the central financial revenue and expenditure of 1933 to show the gains and losses of rising silver prices.</p>
<h3>Decrease in Tariff Due to Silver Value</h3>
<p>Among the items related to the gold and silver ratio in the central government's revenue account, only tariff is relevant. The customs gold unit for tariff collection is a virtual gold standard that is proportional to various gold standard currencies. The amount of annual income has a major relationship with the gold and silver ratio. For example, in the 1933 budget, tariff revenue was more than 35,465,700 yuan, accounting for more than 52% of the total revenue. If the silver price rises, the amount of customs gold depreciation will decrease, and the amount of revenue will decrease accordingly.</p>
<h3>Debt and Diplomatic Expenditures</h3>
<p>Among the items related to the gold and silver ratio in the central government's expenditure account, one is debt expenses, the second is the expenses of embassies and consulates in various countries in diplomatic expenses, and the third is the expenses of studying abroad in education expenses. According to the 1933 budget, the total debt expenses were more than 24,184,200 yuan, of which domestic debt accounted for more than 98,066,600 yuan. The total amount of diplomatic expenses was more than 10,663,000 yuan, of which there were still expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is assumed that the full amount is the expenses of foreign embassies and consulates, which is added to the debt expenses, but it is only more than 150 million yuan, which is more than twice the difference compared to the tariff revenue of more than 350 million yuan. As for the expenses of studying abroad in education expenses, the amount is very small. Therefore, in terms of the central government's financial situation, raising the silver price may not be beneficial.</p>
<h3>Construction and Import Volume</h3>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to purchase machinery, and the silver price can be cheaper after it is high. However, the bulk of goods imported by our country over the years are daily consumer goods, and the tools and raw materials used for re-production are very small in number. This can be seen from the reports of the customs and the International Trade Bureau over the years. When gold is expensive and silver is cheap, our country's emerging industries cannot compete with foreign goods. If the silver price rises, foreign goods will be cheap and dumped continuously, and the industrial and commercial enterprises run by the state will inevitably go bankrupt completely. What is the use of purchasing tools for re-production? By the time the capital is exhausted, how can we talk about construction? Therefore, raising the silver price is ultimately felt to be not worth the loss at this time.</p>
<h3>Banking Community Visited Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the reporter of Shen Shi News Agency, it was learned that the main leaders of the banking industry in this city visited Mr. Kong yesterday afternoon after Mr. Kong arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to discuss how to deal with the U.S. silver policy. Regarding the issue of delaying the signing of the Silver Agreement, it is said that the government has decided to delay the signing. According to Lin Kanghou, Secretary General of the Bankers Association, the government is unlikely to have problems with delaying the signing of the Silver Agreement. Regarding other specific measures, the Bankers Association has not exchanged opinions with the government. Minister Kong's visit to Shanghai may involve personal discussions.</p>
<h3>Qian Yongming's Opinion</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Qian Yongming, manager of the Four Banks Savings Association, the U.S. congressmen also have two factions on the silver price issue. Those who support raising the silver price are mostly congressmen from silver-producing areas, and the representatives of the opposition are from non-silver-producing areas. The competition between the two factions is fierce. Now that the industrial faction has won, the huge outflow of silver from our country will inevitably be unavoidable. The Bankers Association telegraphed the U.S. to express its opposition, and the U.S. President has not yet replied. How to deal with it in the future depends on the development of the situation.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in China at No. 3 Guangdong Road convened an emergency meeting at the American General Assembly on Fuzhou Road at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss U.S. President Roosevelt's issue of raising silver prices. President Ferron chaired the meeting, and more than eighty members attended. The discussion on the protest against the policy of raising silver prices by the Bankers Association of our country was quite long, and it was planned to send a long telegram to President Roosevelt to contribute opinions and ask for careful handling.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Position Unchanged</h3>
<p>According to a major figure in the banking community yesterday, U.S. President Roosevelt is carefully considering how to deal with the issue after receiving the telegram from Shanghai. Once the attitude is determined, a detailed reply telegram will arrive in Shanghai within a few days. At that time, the texts of both parties will be made public. It is expected that President Roosevelt will find it difficult to abandon his original policy and may add theoretical explanations to us. According to the current situation, there is still room for discussion.</p>
<h3>Sharp Rise in the Market Price of Bonds on Both Roads in the British Market</h3>
<p>The market price of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds in London has risen a lot due to the solvency of the railway, especially the payment of surplus profits in 1918. The recent market price has risen to 75 pounds, while it was only 50 pounds in January last year. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has also soared in the London market due to solvency and has jumped to a high of 97 pounds, while it was only 64 pounds in January last year.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of U.S. Wheat Arrives</h3>
<p>More than 8,000 Tons</p>
<p>Another ship fully loaded with U.S. wheat purchased on credit by our country arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, with a total of more than 8,000 tons. The U.S. wheat has been ordered by domestic flour mills, so each merchant hired a barge to unload and transport it. Another batch will arrive in a week.</p>
<h3>Record of Current People's Movements</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, Liu Ruiheng, and Liu Weizhi left Beijing on the overnight express train last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua took the overnight train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders Provinces to Remit Grain Bureau Shares</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi Discusses the Formal Establishment Date of the Bureau</p>
<p>Awaiting Full Payment of Shares Before Convening Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi and Wu Huanru, the chief and deputy directors of the preparatory office for the China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, reported that the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and others have not yet remitted their due shares, significantly affecting the bureau's operations. They jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang a few days ago, outlining the difficulties and requesting instructions on future measures to facilitate the bureau's early establishment. It is now learned that the bureau received Instruction No. 3137 from Chairman Chiang yesterday, approving a telegram to the provincial governments to devise methods for remitting the payments. The original text reads, "Received and noted. Approved to telegraph the governments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Guangdong, and other provinces to devise methods for remitting the payments. Please take note of this order." Furthermore, according to Gu Xinyi's statement to a New News Agency reporter, the formal establishment of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau must await the full payment of shares exceeding 500,000 yuan before a shareholders' inaugural meeting can be convened to make decisions.</p>
<h3>No Confirmation of Mao Weisou's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports from Xiamen that Mao Weisou boarded a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane on the 22nd to come to Shanghai and then proceed to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang. Yesterday morning, reporters went to the airline company to investigate and learned that only two people boarded the Shanghai-Guangdong flight from Xiamen that day: a foreigner and He Ping, a resident of North Sichuan Road. Therefore, it is currently impossible to ascertain whether Mao Weisou has arrived in Shanghai, or has come on a different sea vessel or special plane. It is also confirmed that He Ping, who arrived in Shanghai from Xiamen the day before yesterday, boarded a westbound flight to Hankou yesterday morning and is not using a false name of Mao.</p>
<h3>Fujian Construction Director Chen Ticheng Passes Through Shanghai en Route to Beijing</h3>
<p>Consulting on Fujian's Construction Policies</p>
<p>Chen Ticheng, the newly appointed member of the Fujian Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Construction Department, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday on the Sanbei Company's Xin Ningxing ship. He immediately visited friends at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. After a brief stay in Shanghai, he took the overnight express train to Beijing last night. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is to report on the current situation in Fujian to the administrative authorities and to consult on the construction policies for Fujian in the future. He will remain in Beijing for approximately two weeks before returning to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Shipping Association Cables the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications, Striving to Reclaim China's Shipping Rights</h3>
<p>Seizing the Opportunity of Renewing Treaties with British, American, and Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>To Elevate National Sovereignty to Completeness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Trade Association recently sent a telegram to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications in Nanjing, stating: "To the Honorable Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications, Nanjing: It is our understanding that China's shipping rights have long been encroached upon, and unfavorable treaties are the root cause of this predicament. The public has been eagerly anticipating the reclamation of these rights, and the government should take responsibility for handling this matter. Otherwise, it cannot be called a nation with complete sovereignty or a free and healthy people. The inability of legal jurisdiction to reach foreigners, the presence of concessions throughout commercial ports, and the stationing of foreign troops within our borders are all tools that weaken our nation and oppress our people. The seizure of shipping rights serves as the vanguard of aggression. Once foreign vessels gain unfettered navigation rights and foreign nationals enter the country, their numbers increase daily due to the convenience. This leads to demands for leased residential areas, and with the acquisition of these areas, they seek exemption from legal jurisdiction in peacetime and use protection as a pretext to station troops in times of conflict. The inability to govern foreigners through law, the spread of concessions in commercial ports, and the arbitrary stationing of troops within our borders are all consequences of allowing foreign vessels to navigate our coastal and inland waterways. It is evident that</p>
<p>Reclaiming Shipping Rights Is the Most Critical Focus of Amending Unequal Treaties. Recognizing this, our association, on the 18th day of September in the 18th year, outlined the advantages and disadvantages in detail and separately telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Executive and Legislative Yuan, as well as your esteemed ministry, requesting that all previously granted coastal and inland navigation rights to foreigners be reclaimed during treaty revisions. This would align with revolutionary principles and protect national sovereignty. We subsequently received your ministry's telegram stating, 'Received and noted. The reclamation of shipping rights is a key aspect of amending unequal treaties. We will propose reclaiming these rights at an opportune moment during treaty revisions to meet the public's expectations.' We also received Communication Ministry's approval No. 1907, stating, 'Received and noted. The encroachment of our nation's shipping rights has affected the national economy and the business operations of shipping merchants. This ministry has been planning the reclamation of shipping rights day and night. A proposed plan has been drafted and sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. Future treaty renewals with foreign countries will be carefully reviewed in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strive for the reclamation of shipping rights and meet the public's expectations.' According to the aforementioned telegrams, your esteemed ministry's dedication to the nation and its people is deeply appreciated. We now understand that the Sino-British and Sino-American treaties on commerce and navigation are due for renewal, and that the</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Treaty Has Not Yet Been Ratified. Seizing the opportunity of treaty renewal, restoring our lost shipping rights, your esteemed ministry will surely follow the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and alleviate the suffering of the people. Our only concern is that if a gradual approach is adopted, or if mutual benefit is used as an exchange, the resulting disaster will be even greater than before. Mutual benefit presupposes need and takes profit as the standard. Whether the needs are suitable or urgent, and whether the benefits are tangible or equal, must be carefully examined and thoroughly compared. Our nation's shipping industry is still in its infancy, and the main reason for this is the encroachment on shipping rights by foreign vessels. It is like someone who has had their house taken over by a noisy guest and is struggling to cope. To try and divide oneself to entertain the guest in his room and interact with him is impossible until the guest has left and the house is peaceful. The inability of our nation's commercial shipping to navigate the domestic waters of Europe, America, and Japan is similar. Therefore, revising treaties on the basis of mutual benefit would leave our nation's sovereignty incomplete and would be absolutely harmful and without benefit to our shipping industry. If this is not understood, then</p>
<p>A Major Mistake Will Be Made, Which Will Be Irreversible. Our association, deeply involved and experienced in this matter, does not shy away from elaborating in detail, and earnestly implores your esteemed ministry to pay special attention. Some say that while the number of Chinese ships has gradually increased in recent years, if shipping rights are reclaimed and all foreign vessels cease operations, our nation's coastal and inland ports may not have sufficient capacity to meet the demand, potentially hindering transportation. However, the reason our nation's commercial vessels are fewer than those of foreign countries is due to business failures, and the reason for those failures is the oppression by foreign vessels. If shipping rights can be reclaimed and only our nation's commercial vessels are allowed to operate on coastal and inland routes, business will flourish, and success can be assured. With the prospect of profitability, merchants throughout the country will invest in the shipping industry in droves. Existing companies will easily expand, and new shipping companies will emerge daily, ensuring the domestic transportation needs are met. Even in the current situation, the available Chinese ships can be allocated and supplemented to barely meet the demand, so there is no need to overthink this. In summary, abolishing unequal treaties is the teaching of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, the doctrine of the Kuomintang, and the duty of the government and the people. We must overcome all difficulties to achieve this goal, with no room for hesitation or retreat. We earnestly implore your esteemed ministry to uphold the teachings, follow the doctrine, heed the will of the people, seize the opportunity, and thoroughly reclaim the lost shipping rights, so that the nation can be elevated to a position of complete sovereignty, and the people can be placed in a position of freedom and health. The nation will be fortunate, the people will be fortunate, and not only will the shipping industry benefit forever. In urgent anticipation of your response, the chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association, Yu Hede, respectfully bows."</p>

<h3>Document Submitted to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Association submitted documents to the municipal government's Social Affairs Bureau and various courts yesterday, stating: "Submitting this document to revitalize the city, prosper Shanghai, reduce rent, and alleviate the people's livelihood, hoping that you will review and approve the motion to promote this effort quickly to reduce rent, maintain the people's livelihood, and properly plan association affairs. Since the city suffered a tremendous disaster in January 28, 1932, vitality has not yet been restored. The war zone has become a wasteland, and the entire city has become a land of death. The city's condition is deteriorating daily, unemployment is increasing, goods lack markets, and people have no means of survival. The current situation is difficult to sustain, and we cannot afford to consider future troubles. To strengthen the foundation, we must choose what is urgent. Currently, the issue of reducing rent has been forced to become an urgent problem. Landlords and tenants are closely related and should be able to pass through (this difficult time) together. Who would willingly resist? However, there are a few landlords who only know how to benefit themselves and disregard the livelihood of the people. On this day of popular hardship, they have repeatedly increased rents unreasonably. If their desires are not met, they resort to coercion, requesting courts to pursue and detain (tenants) or renovating old houses. Once one landlord initiates such actions, many others follow suit, creating a bad precedent. Among the city's more than three million residents, tenants account for eight or nine out of ten. Reducing clothing and food already requires careful management, and high rents are even more difficult to cope with. Recently, bankruptcies and deaths have been heard of daily, and the main reason is economic hardship. This association was formed by various legitimate groups at the request of all city residents and filed with the city party headquarters and other authorities. A general meeting of representatives also resolved on rent reduction principles as a basis for the rent reduction movement. As for the housing tax, which relates to government expenses, it was also resolved that it should still be paid at the current original amount, so that there is no loss of housing tax, and tenants benefit. Regarding landlords, it was also resolved that all vacant houses must pay housing tax to prevent landlords from holding them up and demanding higher rents. The government can also use this to increase revenue. Regarding landlords, they should also realize that extortion is unreliable. By changing to fair and meager profits, tenants will have lighter burdens, and there will be no worries about renting out vacant houses. The municipal government will also avoid the burden of vacant houses. However, the capitalist mindset does not understand the general trend of people's livelihood and society, arbitrarily making excessive demands, creating a deadlock, causing the people to lose hope of recovery, and the business market is in danger of collapsing. This association's duty lies in speaking frankly and pleading for the people. Therefore, we are submitting this document to the government for review and approval, hoping that you will consider the people's suffering, announce and implement it, and prevent landlords from using the pretext of renovating houses or transferring ownership to increase rents in order to maintain the overall situation and comfort the people. It would truly be a virtuous and convenient act. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Notice to Citizens</h3>
<p>"Notice: This association is carrying out the movement to reduce rent in response to the public will of the citizens and the needs of the times. Adjusting the livelihood of the people and stabilizing society lies in this. Rent reduction principles have been resolved by a general meeting of representatives. (Printed separately) Rent shall be paid according to the law, and rent reduction measures shall be handled from January 1934 onwards. If the landlord refuses to accept rent, the rent due shall be deposited in a bank. If tenants have overdue rent up to 1932, it shall be repaid in installments within one year. The rights and interests of rent reduction shall be the same for sub-lessors and sub-tenants. In addition to submitting this document to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and various courts, we hereby give notice."</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Discusses the Government's Purpose in Managing Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that the Shanghai Guanghua Medical and Pharmaceutical Journal Society received a quick letter from its Beijing-based reporter yesterday stating that the central government has a plan to manage traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) which it intends to implement soon. The reporter went to interview Central Committee member Chen Lifu, and asked what the government's purpose was in managing TCM. Chen responded that the government manages TCM to recognize that TCM has thousands of years of history and value, and also because it is concerned about the importance of human life and cannot allow incompetent doctors to kill people at will. Therefore, there must be examinations to distinguish between the good and the bad, and then licenses to practice medicine will be granted. This is the government's purpose in managing TCM. Furthermore, in the future, the government should not be biased towards Western medicine when managing medical affairs, and should not disregard Chinese medicine. The government should vigorously promote research, elucidate, and demonstrate Chinese medicine. The government should also establish specialized agencies to investigate folk remedies and herbs at any time, conduct chemical experiments and provide proof, so that people can have very convenient doctors and very cheap medicines.</p>
<h3>Eighteen Bookstores Petition the Authorities to Exempt Books from Prohibition</h3>
<p>Commercial Decline Makes Maintenance Difficult</p>
<p>It Inevitably Impairs the Future of Culture</p>
<p>The China Authors and Publishers Association submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday, stating: "Submitting this document regarding a large number of publications being ordered to be banned and destroyed, requesting a re-examination and lenient treatment to alleviate the plight of businesses and maintain culture. We, the stores, have been engaged in the publishing business in Shanghai for many years. Although it is a for-profit enterprise, we have always sought to contribute to education and promote culture. Therefore, we have always been extremely cautious in publishing books, hoping to avoid harming society or violating laws, thereby harming our own business. Recently, the central government has been very strict in cracking down on publications, and we have become even more vigilant and dare not be negligent. (A) We have followed the provisions of the Publication Law of the Ministry of Interior. (B) On the 19th of this month, officials from your department (Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters) visited our stores in person to verbally announce that we were ordered to prohibit the publication of various publications according to the secret order of the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters (your department), and to submit the printed books and printing plates to the department for destruction within a limited time. In total, hundreds of books were investigated and banned, including some that had previously been submitted to the Central Party Headquarters (your department) for review and revision and approved for distribution, some that had been reviewed and registered by the Ministry of Interior and granted publishing copyrights, and some that had been published for many years and had long been considered harmless. We were not notified that these should be banned. The public was terrified and speechless. We believe that the stores are all small businesses. From receiving the manuscript to publishing a book, it takes a year and a half. The investment is no less than four or five hundred gold yuan. Therefore, we must be extremely cautious when printing. We believe that the books that were ordered to be banned this time do not violate the law. Even if it is unavoidable to be negligent, it is only in the words, sentences, or chapters. If the Central Party Headquarters (your department) considers that there are still many violations, if you kindly provide instructions tomorrow and order us to revise, we will be happy to comply. But now, without distinguishing between minor and major offenses, all books are banned and destroyed. At a time of educational decline and commercial depression, the stores are struggling to maintain themselves. This major blow will make it impossible for us to survive. Moreover, in the future, all publishers will be afraid of this severe punishment and will no longer dare to print books, which seems to impair the future of culture. Therefore, we urgently submit this joint petition to your bureau (department), hoping that you will consider the plight of the stores and (forward it to the Central Party Headquarters) for a thorough re-examination of the large number of publications that were banned this time. If there are any chapters or sentences that violate the law, please point them out separately and order the stores to revise them or leave them blank and reprint them to avoid complete destruction. This way, the hard-earned capital of the stores will not be lost, and the central government's intention to correct ideology and crack down on publications will also be seen as more cautious, which will greatly benefit the future of culture. Whether or not this is feasible, we respectfully request your approval and compliance. This would be a virtuous and convenient act. In addition to submitting this to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters (Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau) (Central Party Headquarters) to forward it, we respectfully submit this to Modern, Nantong, Huatong, Kaiming, Tianma, New Life, Beixin, Liming, United, Asia East, New China, Guanghua, Children, Liangyou, Life, Sanyou, Shenzhou, Guangming and other eighteen bookstores."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Water Board to Hold Pilot Examination</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs Issues Red Cross Society Train Tickets</h3>
<p>The National Government regards the Chinese Red Cross Society as a charitable organization of the International League of Nations. Last year, the Legislative Yuan formulated and promulgated management regulations, and ordered the Ministries of Military Affairs, Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy to jointly draft implementing rules. They stipulated that the treatment of public officials of the Red Cross Society should be the same as that of the military, and that the government should allocate free train and ship tickets for them.

<h3>National Postal Workers' Union Requests Completion of "Postal Worker" Airplane</h3>
<p>National Postal Workers Donate a Total of 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The national postal worker aviation donation, totaling over 290,000 yuan, has been remitted to the central government by the Directorate General of Posts. The National Postal Workers' Union and various local postal workers' unions have repeatedly requested the central government to purchase an airplane named "Postal Worker" to encourage and live up to its name. However, this has not yet been realized. The National Postal Workers' Union yesterday sent another letter to the Directorate General of Posts and submitted it to the Ministry, urging early implementation. The original text is as follows: "We have learned that your directorate was ordered to collect aviation donations from postal workers, which has already concluded, with a total donation of 292,968 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen. The original purpose of the aviation donation was to purchase airplanes for consolidating air defense. Moreover, the airplanes purchased with these funds are often named after the donors to commemorate and encourage them. Recently, according to a report in this newspaper on the 13th of this month, the Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Ping-Han Railway Bureau, stating that railway workers purchased ten airplanes, two of which went to Wuhan and were named 'Ping-Han' Numbers 1 and 2, to comfort the workers' expectations. Furthermore, the other eight airplanes are all named 'Railway,' which is one example. Our national postal workers' aviation donation amounts to 300,000 yuan. In terms of patriotic donations, we are not behind anyone. Our union has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Communications and sent letters to your directorate, suggesting that the central competent authority quickly purchase airplanes and name them 'Postal Worker' to maintain credibility and meet the public's expectations, which are all on record. However, up to this day, it has not been implemented. Our union and postal workers across the country strongly disapprove of this donation being used for other purposes. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry, we are sending this letter to your directorate, requesting you to quickly forward it to the competent authority for implementation, to maintain our public relationship." This is addressed to the Directorate General of Posts. (The text submitted to the Ministry of Communications is similar and omitted).</p>

<h3>Arrested for Embezzling Huge Amounts of Treasury Bonds After Failing in Speculation</h3>
<p>Yu Ruide, a native of Ningbo, 24 years old, residing at No. 10, New Dagulu Road, was employed as an accountant at Qinyi Securities Firm, broker No. 29 at the Huashang Securities Exchange, Room 101, No. 429, Jiujiang Road, for several years. Because he engaged in margin trading speculation, he repeatedly suffered losses and was unable to pay them off. He had no choice but to take 80,000 yuan worth of 18th Year Customs Revenue Treasury Bonds and 22nd Year 2.5% Tobacco Bonds stored in the exchange and falsify the accounts to cover it up. However, the owner of the firm discovered this during a search and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which in turn reported it to the First Special Court and issued an arrest warrant. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Detective Wang Jiaju went and arrested Yu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case, charging Yu with embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that according to the plaintiff, the defendant may have committed fraud in the accounts of customers and banks and money shops he dealt with, which still needs to be investigated, so he requested that the hearing be adjourned. When questioned, the defendant confessed without denying it. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered that the hearing be adjourned for one week.</p>

<h3>Improving Shanghai's Police</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Asks Li Wanli to Undertake the Design</p>
<p>The Public Safety Bureau Forms a Police Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, believing that the city's police districts were established twenty years ago and are no longer suitable due to municipal improvements in recent years, has specially invited police expert Li Wanli to undertake the improvement design and has instructed him on the following improvement directions: (1) Shanghai's financial resources are stretched and cannot exceed the original budget; (2) To enable the police to be proactive and conscientious, attention must be paid to patrol areas, with one police officer assigned to each area to be responsible for all police duties; (3) To make it clear to the public, all Public Safety Bureau offices must be named after the local place name, abolishing the terms "First" and "Second." Mr. Li has now, based on the directions given by the Mayor and with reference to principles and actual conditions, begun the design. The Public Safety Bureau has also dispatched Inspector Cheng Fengyi to accompany Mr. Li on a survey of the terrain to facilitate the demarcation of districts. To promote cooperation, the Public Safety Bureau Director, Jiao Hongen, has specially gathered the bureau's commissioned police officers and organized a police reorganization committee, and has invited Mr. Li to participate to avoid gaps and promote harmony.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Safety Bureau Re-Enforces Prohibition of Gambling and Profiteering</h3>
<p>Fearing a Resurgence of Gambling During the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>Strict Arrests Will Be Made for Those Who Dare to Violate</p>
<p>The Director of the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau, Wen Hongen, fearing gambling and profiteering during the Lunar New Year, has specifically re-enforced the ban. In addition to ordering all district offices to strictly prohibit it, he has also issued a proclamation to the public for general knowledge. The original text of the proclamation is as follows: Gambling and profiteering are not only detrimental to morality but also affect the livelihood of ordinary people and should be severely punished according to the law. Orders have been repeatedly issued to prohibit them, but unfortunately, with the passage of time, people become complacent and repeat the same mistakes. Ignorant people often exhaust the fruits of their year-long labor, throwing it all away in a single gamble, even mortgaging and borrowing to try to win. If they win, they indulge in pleasure without restraint and become dissolute. If they lose, they become discouraged and lose their spirit, unable to sustain their lives. At best, they waste time and lose their jobs. At worst, they are ruined and their families are destroyed. Harmony is lost in the family, and disasters arise from this, directly harming the family and indirectly harming society. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, there is a fear of a resurgence of gambling. At a time when the economy is declining and resources are scarce, all our citizens should not waste any more of their mental or financial resources. This bureau, in charge of public safety, is responsible for banning gambling. Therefore, a proclamation is hereby issued to reiterate the warnings, urging people from all walks of life to comply and refrain from gambling. Those who dare to violate will be strictly arrested. As for teahouses that engage in gambling and profiteering, in addition to being arrested according to the law, they will be ordered to close down without leniency. Be warned. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Association Sends Letter Requesting Strict Punishment for Impersonating a Lawyer</h3>
<p>Ding Zhongfu, residing at No. 21, Yideli, Penglai Road, Chengnan, on the second floor of the living room, has been impersonating lawyer Ding Shimin, defrauding parties of money. He even dared to impersonate a lawyer and appear in court at the First Special District Court. The case has been exposed, and he has been arrested and detained awaiting strict punishment, as reported in this newspaper on the 22nd. It is now learned that Ding Zhongfu was once a clerk at a lawyer's office, where he deceived parties in all matters as his business. It is known that lawyer Ding Shimin resides in West Shanghai, so he dared to impersonate lawyer Ding and appear in court at the Special District Court. Later, lawyer Ding Shimin met the opposing lawyer and learned the details. Lawyer Ding Shimin reported the details to the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, and after discussion by the members of the Standing Committee, it was decided that if such fraudulent activities are not reported and dealt with, there is a fear that others will follow suit. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate, requesting an investigation. Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying, believing that Ding Zhongfu was brazen and openly impersonating a lawyer, which was extremely illegal, secretly ordered Police Officer Chen Xihui, in coordination with the second precinct of the second district, to dispatch additional police officers to arrest Ding Zhongfu in the early morning while he was still asleep. He was taken into custody, awaiting orders to summon the defrauded parties to the court for interrogation and strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Female Headmaster Sues Female Teacher's Father-in-Law</h3>
<p>For Hiding His Daughter-in-Law and Preventing Her From Coming to School</p>
<p>And Assaulting Her When She Went to Question Him</p>
<p>The Judge Hopes Both Parties Will Try to Reconcile</p>
<p>Zhuo Jiezhen, a Guangdong woman and headmaster of Baocui Elementary School in Tianfuli, Elqin Road, recently hired lawyer Chen Nan to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court against Zhong Yaolao, a Cantonese man and owner of the Haoshilai Food Store on Jielu Road, for restricting freedom. The facts of her lawsuit are as follows: Zhuo founded Baocui Elementary School in 1928 and has been running it for six years. When school started on January 13th of this year, she hired Zhong Rong's daughter-in-law, Zhong Qu Yue'e, a Cantonese woman and daughter of Qu Yueshan, to serve as a first-grade teacher. Unexpectedly, after only half a month, Yue'e took a day off on January 29th and then another day off on the 30th. By the 31st, she still had not come to school, causing classes to be suspended. However, because the school had only recently started, the suspension of classes was affecting the school and the children's studies. Therefore, on February 1st, she questioned Qu Yueshan, the introducer, and asked her to inquire with the defendant. Zhuo then went with her husband, Tan Qingpu, to the defendant's place to urge Yue'e to come to school. Unexpectedly, the defendant not only hid Yue'e upstairs, preventing her from seeing them, but also detained Zhuo in the store, inciting the shop assistants to arbitrarily assault and humiliate her, restricting her freedom of movement for about two hours. He then falsely accused Zhuo of abducting his daughter-in-law, Yue'e, and took her to the police station. After clarifying the matter, they ordered Zhuo to go home. The defendant's actions constitute the crimes of restricting freedom and defaming reputation under Articles 316 and 330 of the Criminal Law, and therefore a lawsuit is filed, along with a private suit, requesting compensation for the losses incurred. The court approved the lawsuit and ordered a hearing for yesterday afternoon. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 8. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Wu Shaoshan appeared on his behalf, stating that the defendant was ill due to his age and being upset, so he could not appear in court today and requested an adjournment. Judge Liu briefly questioned the plaintiff, Zhuo Jiezhen, about her age and hometown. Since both parties are formal merchants and the lawsuit arose from a school dispute, to resolve the matter peacefully, he advised the lawyers of both parties to go out and try to reconcile. The case was adjourned for further hearing on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit for Divorce Due to Favoritism Towards a Concubine and Abuse of Wife</h3>
<p>The First Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Judgment Scheduled for the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>Gu Wenrong, a bank employee of nearly forty years old, residing in Zhenxingli, Zhangjiahuayuan, Jing'ansi Road, owns considerable real estate and is known for his wealth. In 1922, he married Li Yuezhen, a woman from Jiangwan. They have been married for more than ten years and have one son and two daughters. The couple was initially very harmonious, but in recent years, Gu has also been deeply influenced by the trends of the times. Because his legal wife did not know how to be modern, she was set aside. He took in a young woman surnamed Hua as a concubine and lived with her. Gu overprotected his beloved concubine and mistreated his legal wife. All household affairs and monthly rental income were handed over to the concubine for management. Because Li could no longer endure this abuse, she could only return to her mother's home in Ningbo and hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit for divorce and alimony against Gu Wenrong in the First Special District Court. The court has already held a hearing, but because it was necessary to summon witnesses, the hearing was adjourned until yesterday afternoon. Judge Qiao Wanxuan continued the hearing. The defendant, Gu Wenrong, did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant had previously confessed to taking a concubine. Since he did not appear today, he should be allowed to debate in his absence. The court approved the request, and the lawyer summarized the case and the relief sought, mainly based on three points: bigamy, abuse, and abandonment by the defendant, making it impossible for the plaintiff to continue living with him, and therefore filing the lawsuit, requesting a judgment: (1) granting the divorce; (2) granting custody of the three children to the plaintiff; (3) awarding the plaintiff 4,000 yuan for her dowry; (4) awarding the plaintiff 10,000 yuan in compensation; (5) awarding 10,000 yuan for the children's education expenses; and (6) making the defendant responsible for the litigation costs. Judge Qiao then announced that a judgment would be scheduled for the afternoon of the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Ancient Artifact Exports from China in the Last Five Years</h3>
<p>Annual Statistics of Approximately One Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, China has the longest history and more ancient artifacts than other countries. There are many collectors in the country, and there are also many who operate businesses by transporting and selling them abroad. As a result, Chinese ancient artifacts flow into foreign lands year after year, amounting to approximately one million yuan annually. Most of them are exported to the United States, France, Britain, Japan, and Canada, followed by others. The export statistics for the last five years are listed below:</p>
<p>1929: 1,497,600 customs taels</p>

<h3>Ministry-Determined Principles for Calculating Long and Short Route Transportation Costs for Intermodal Goods</h3>
<p>The two railway bureaus received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday stating that, according to a case presented by the Intermodal Transport Office, the Railway and Longhai Railway Traffic Offices sent a telegram to the Intermodal Transport Office regarding the transportation of 40 tons of soap from Shanghai Station, specifying that it was to be transported via Jinpu and Beining to Shijiazhuang. However, the Xuzhoufu Station on the Jinpu Railway mistakenly transferred it to the Longhai Railway, resulting in a change of route. Due to the different refund and deduction of intermodal transport costs and the different basic freight rates of each railway, the shorter route had higher transportation costs, while the longer route had lower transportation costs. The loss of the Beining Railway was not enough to offset the gain of the Longhai Railway, resulting in insufficient distribution of the original transportation costs and requiring the merchant to pay the difference. The Ministry has now decided on the following principles: (1) For goods that can travel the same origin and destination via two routes, if the mileage of the route designated by the merchant is longer but the transportation cost is lower, and the purpose is solely to reduce transportation costs, the railway should charge the transportation cost of the shorter route and still transport it via the shorter route. (2) The transportation cost collected for the shorter route should be distributed to the actually transporting railways according to the proportion of transportation costs that each railway should receive. According to the above principles, the transportation cost of the 40 tons of soap should still be calculated according to the route via Jinpu and Beining, and no additional transportation costs should be collected from the merchant. The above transportation costs should be distributed among the Jinghu, Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan railways according to the proportion of transportation costs that each railway should receive. The staff at the Xuzhoufu Station on the Jinpu and Longhai railways who made the mistake of transferring the soap freight cars should be warned so that they pay attention to the route filled in on the freight ticket and car plate when transferring freight cars in the future. The originating station should also find a way to specially indicate the route of such freight cars on the car plate and the envelope containing the freight ticket to facilitate identification by the connecting station. In addition to issuing the industry to the clearing division of the Intermodal Transport Office to handle according to the above principles in the freight intermodal transport account for that month and ordering separately, it is hereby ordered to comply. The bureau has forwarded this order to the Traffic Office for compliance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Military Affairs Establishes Shipping Supply Office in Shanghai</h3>

He telegraphed to request assistance in soliciting various medicines for relief. The commission specially sent a letter to the Shanghai Xinwei Relief Association in this city to request assistance. The original text of the letter is as follows: "Respected Sirs, we have recently received a telegram from Chairman Liu Zhenhua of Anhui Province stating that the people in counties such as Liuan and Lihuang in western Anhui have been ravaged by Red Bandits for years and are suffering greatly. Recently, due to the suppression of scattered bandits, refugees have fled and gathered near Lihuang, reaching more than 40,000 people who are clamoring for food. He has dispatched personnel to distribute urgent relief and has set up reception centers in Mabao, Sujiabu, and other places. The directors of each center have reported that many refugees are suffering from malaria, dysentery, and plague. If relief is not provided quickly, the transmission will spread rapidly in the coming spring, which is unimaginable. He intends to solicit various medicines, such as Jisheng Water, Jisheng Dan, Wan Jin You, and malaria and dysentery powder, to be transported to the Anhui Provincial Government and transferred to the Liuan Post-Disaster Preparation Office for distribution to benefit the disaster victims. We have long admired your association's charitable deeds, enthusiasm for relief, and the effectiveness of the various medicines you manufacture.

In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this letter to you, hoping that you will check and reply as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Summary of Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Budget</h3>

The partial construction cost of the new pig slaughterhouse planned to be built in the East District is 50,000 yuan, because the asphalt manufacturing machine must be moved first, the reduction is 5,000 yuan, marked with the letter A.</p>

The reconstruction of the Avenue Road vegetable market is hindered by existing business, with a nominal fee of 100 yuan marked with the letter "C." The expansion of the Xiaoshadu Road vegetable market should be delayed, costing 80,000 yuan and marked with the letter "C." The Hongkou vegetable market plans to convert existing bungalows into three-story buildings at an estimated cost of one million yuan. As this may interfere with existing operations, it is proposed to wait until the new meat market is completed before further discussion, with a nominal fee of 100 yuan marked with the letter "C." The Beijing Road vegetable market will have a third-floor roof added and a freight elevator installed for 100,000 yuan, marked with the letter "C." The expansion of the Xinzha vegetable market is pending the acquisition of land. Wooden partitions will be added to Machao Road, North Fujian Road, Pingliang Road, and other locations. All of these expenses are marked with the letter "C."</p>
<h3>Open-Air Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>The open-air swimming pool plans to expand the men's changing room, requiring 7,000 yuan. However, as the pool is already very crowded, it is generally believed that it is better to build a new pool instead of spending more money here. This item is marked with the letter "C." Regarding the construction of a new pool, it will be discussed after the Director of Public Works submits an investigation report.</p>
<h3>Sanitation Branch</h3>
<p>The Health Department plans to build a third eastern branch office on Zhoushan Road, costing 7,000 yuan, marked with the letter "D." The first northern branch office costs 45,000 yuan, the second eastern branch office costs 15,000 yuan, and the first western branch office costs 27,000 yuan. These figures are all marked with the letter "C."</p>
<h3>Other Construction</h3>

As for recurring expenses, excluding material costs and various donations, the original listed amount exceeded the previous year by 160,000 yuan. After review and reduction, the excess amount was reduced to 78,730 yuan, bringing the total to 1,683,990 yuan, an increase of 4.9% compared to the previous year. The main reason for the increase is the recurring maintenance costs of the new slaughterhouse and the management fees for food and milk.

<h3>Western Doctor Robertson Robbed in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Only three thieves are involved</p>
<p>Tried in court yesterday</p>
<p>Xu A Jin, a patrolman from the Zhabei Police Department in charge of prostitutes at No. 642, Third Road of the brothel, and his Western police chief Xie Er, went to the Feilong Shoe Store on the third floor of No. 431 Zhejiang Road at 5:00 PM on the 5th of last month to arrest prostitutes. At that time, a woman, Wang Xiuzhen, fell and died from the building. The police believed that Wang's death was due to jumping from the building to avoid punishment, resulting in the fall. However, Wang's mother, Wang Guo, and Wang's husband, Gan Zhigang, believed that the cause of her death was that the police had falsely accused the deceased of being a private prostitute and had beaten her severely. The deceased retreated to the window, but the police were still not satisfied and rushed forward and pushed her violently, causing the deceased to fall to her death. Therefore, they hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to sue Xu A Jin for murder in the Criminal Court of the First Special District and filed a civil lawsuit to demand compensation of 3,000 yuan. After the Special Court's interrogation was concluded, Judge Liu Yugui held a hearing yesterday afternoon and announced the verdict. The main text of the judgment was that Xu A Jin was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence in his duties. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail on call. Before providing the bail bond, he will be temporarily bailed out by the defendant's defense lawyer Wei.</p>
<h3>National Invention of Water-Powered Motor</h3>
<p>Submitting to the National Government Again Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>Mr. Shan Chunqiao and Mr. Chen Xinbiao from Zhejiang, after successfully inventing the water-powered motor (i.e., the self-powered engine) last year, aroused the attention of all circles at home and abroad. However, the inventors' application to the central government for approval to guarantee patent rights has not been approved by the relevant department for more than a year. Therefore, it cannot be officially opened. Recently, it has been heard that the inventors, due to the difficulty of delaying the matter any further, have submitted another document to the National Government and the Ministry of Industry. The original submission is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Document to the National Government</h3>
<p>Submitting a request for assistance in the invention of a self-powered engine in order to achieve complete success and practical application. The people have spent more than ten years of effort and sacrificed all kinds of spiritual and economic resources to invent a kind of "self-powered engine" that does not require any fuel consumption and only needs a small amount of water to start the machine wheel, which rotates freely. Its power is equal to that of motors and engines that use electricity, kerosene, and other fuels, and even surpasses them. The people originally planned to manufacture the entire engine and open it to the public for testing. However, the production of the entire engine to practical use requires thousands of gold pieces. The people have sacrificed too much in research, resulting in a violation of their wishes. They are willing to stop in the middle of the road, and all their life's efforts have been paid to the east. Therefore, on the 4th of this month, they submitted a detailed document to the government, requesting practical assistance. After more than ten days, they have not received any good news. They hereby submit another document to the government requesting assistance. This matter concerns the invention of the Chinese people. It is hoped that it will be approved immediately. They are extremely eager to wait for orders. Respectfully submitted to the Chairman of the National Government, Lin, by Chen Xinbiao and Shan Chunqiao.</p>
<h3>Document to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Submitting a request for prompt protection of the self-powered engine. The people have invented a kind of "self-powered engine" that does not require any fuel consumption and only needs a small amount of water to start the machine wheel, which rotates freely. Its power is equal to that of motors and engines that use electricity, kerosene, and other fuels, that is, the existing specialized leading types, and the size of the specialization is the same according to its needs, and its advantages surpass them. It has been successfully announced and published in various newspapers. The people originally planned to make the entire engine to meet the needs. Now, because they have not obtained sufficient protection from the Ministry, it is inconvenient to present it rashly. In addition, in the process of research, they have worked hard and failed more than a hundred times over more than ten years, resulting in too much sacrifice. Therefore, they have violated their wishes. Therefore, in November of last year, they prepared a document and attached drawings and instructions, submitting it to the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry, requesting a fair evaluation and the issuance of a certificate so that they could raise funds to complete the entire engine and make it practical. Although they have submitted several documents, they have never received a reply, which is very incomprehensible. Now, the establishment of the preparatory office has been long overdue, and the economy is exhausted. It is difficult to delay the matter any further, and the villains are imitating it. It is impossible to submit to the government, requesting assistance, hoping that you will be concerned about the difficulties. This matter concerns the invention of the Chinese people. At this critical moment, I sincerely hope that you will approve it immediately. I am extremely eager to wait for orders. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Industry Chen Junjian by Chen Xinbiao and Shan Chunqiao.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Qimei Road Bridge in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Burning Down Six Straw Houses, Five Families</p>
<p>The Qimei Road Bridge area in Zhabei is inhabited by poor people who live in thatched huts and work as rickshaw pullers. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Household Registration Section has not numbered the houses. At around 11:00 PM the night before last, a fire broke out at the house of Lu Liu due to carelessness. In an instant, clouds of smoke filled the area and quickly spread to the roof. When the nearby police learned of the fire, they immediately notified the Zhabei fire brigades in various sections and dispatched fire trucks to rush to the scene to extinguish the fire with all their might. After about an hour, the fire was extinguished, but six thatched huts, including five families, were burned down. The scene was very chaotic. The chief of the fifth district and third precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Yizeng, sent police to suppress the chaos, maintain order, and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire starter, Lu Liu, was taken to the station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Kun Opera Preservation Society's Successful Performance</h3>
<p>The Kun Opera Preservation Society's second performance, yesterday was the first night. Before 8 o'clock, both the upper and lower seats were full. The first play was Qiao Zhijun's "Night Flight," with agile movements and steady postures. The second was Xu Liecheng's "Yunyang Dharma Field," a work that emphasized both singing and acting, and was performed flawlessly from beginning to end. Wang Yimin's "Cui Shi" was effortless and full of color. Pang Jingzhou and Gu Chuanjie's "Questioning and Exploring" were excellent. Ding Zhixiang and Zhang Zhaocheng's "Linked Rings: Small Feast" were one brave and extraordinary, the other mature and deeply calculating. Wang Fumin's "Chopping E" was a Zhengdan leading role, with extremely heavy singing. Mr. Wang's words were clear and his voice was mournful, making him a prominent figure. Xiang Xinwu's "Good Date" was well-known for its strengths. The "Twelve Reds" section had delicate singing and flexible movements, making it an excellent combination of singing and dancing. Yin Zhenxian assisted him with his skills as a veteran craftsman, making it a perfect match. Zhang Zidong's "Beat the Gong" contained sadness within strict restraint, making the audience feel sad and worthy of an old writer. The Yao brothers cooperated with him, making it even more impressive. The finale, "Peony Pavilion," featured Mei Lanfang's Du Liniang, with the beautiful scenery of "Wandering in the Garden" and the charming drowsiness of "Dream of Awakening." He portrayed a heartbroken young woman who was injured in the spring vividly and delicately. The art of the play was to its peak. Yu Zhenfei's Liu Mengmei was extremely affectionate, with a graceful demeanor and a melodious voice, unmatched at the time. Qin Wangjie's Chunxiang was a vivid and innocent girl of thirteen or fourteen years old, charming and lovable. Wang Detian, Pan Xiangsheng, Qin Tongli, and Zhang Zhaocheng also cooperated well. With such a wonderful program, no wonder the audience was never tired. Tonight is the second day of the performance, with Mei Lanfang and Yu Zhenfei performing "Broken Bridge and Yaotai" as a double performance. Other plays are also more exciting, and the grand occasion will surely be even better.</p>
<h3>The Wuhan Municipal Government Bans the Dadong Textbook</h3>
<p>The Dadong Bookstore in this city, due to the publication of a natural science textbook that damaged the reputation of the telegraph, aroused the public anger of the telegraph bureau staff. The Hankou Telegraph Bureau has also filed a request with the Hankou Municipal Government for review. The Hankou Municipal Government, because the textbook is based on fiction and violates the facts, is enough to harm children and damage the reputation of state-owned enterprises. It has approved the request of the Hankou Telegraph Bureau and ordered all schools not to purchase the textbook.</p>
<h3>The Contribution of Dazhong Laundry Company to Women</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Yafei, director of the business department of Dazhong Laundry Company at No. 18, opposite the Postal Bureau on North Sichuan Road in this city, after inventing the solid-quality washing and dyeing method last year, has been recognized by all circles as an unprecedented contribution to the washing and dyeing industry in our country. Therefore, the company's business has also greatly advanced, and its achievements have exceeded the budget. However, in order to combine with all circles and publicize the quality, theory, and technology of this method, Mr. Wu has specially set up five departments: consultant, research, communication, training, and collection and delivery, in order to promote the convenience of service to all circles. At the same time, a kind of postcard with the company's address printed on it is available for customers without telephones to communicate with, and can be obtained at any time. Mr. Wu is currently continuing to study various scientific washing and dyeing methods in order to make his products reach the best and most beautiful state. It is now heard that Mr. Wu, in view of the current fashionable women's coats, which are popular with hard collars, but once washed, their fluffy nature is completely lost, and the texture becomes hairy, making it impossible to restore them, deeply regrets this. Therefore, he has devoted himself to research, spending more than five months of effort, and finally used chemical methods to invent a non-acidic, pure, and clean gelatin. After washing and dyeing, applying this glue not only makes the clothes look like new, but also keeps the texture unchanged. Therefore, it can be used for washing and dyeing new cheongsams and other clothes.</p>

All our compatriots across the country wish to punish this traitor who harms the nation and brings disaster to the people.

Respectfully, the Railway Workers' Union of the Jinghu, Huhang, and Yong Railways, directly under the Ministry of Railways.</p>

<p>Respectfully, regarding the article "A Fierce Battle in a Robbery of a Bride" published in your newspaper on the 18th of this month, upon verification, many of the facts are inconsistent. According to the report submitted by the Sixth Jia of our regiment, the bride robbery was a personal action by Yan Quansheng. This Jia did not have any regimental soldiers, personnel, or firearms mixed in. Furthermore, according to the report of the Eighth, while on patrol that night, they heard news of a bride robbery at the Kang family's residence in the territory and immediately rushed to stop it, detaining Yan Guixu, Yan Jinsheng, Yan Meisheng, Qian Shengrong, and other four relatives of Yan Quansheng on the spot. After inquiries, it was found that there were no other circumstances, and they were released together. There was no fierce battle with any team. Based on this, we respectfully submit this letter for correction, hoping that you will take note and publish it in the Letters to the Editor section to clarify the facts. With best wishes,</p>
<p>The Second District Regiment Headquarters of the Baoshan County Defense Regiment.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement We would like to thank the Commercial Press for donating one copy each of the "Children's World" 4th issue and "English Weekly" 70th issue yesterday. Thank you.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Translation Clarification</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Seeing that your library has established this column in the newspaper makes me unspeakably happy. Although I am not a reading member of your library, and although I live in such a remote countryside, I am very fortunate: while reading the "Shen Bao," I can get a free ride. So, gentlemen, I picked up my pen and wrote this letter.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the creation of your column is worthy of praise for the current Chinese cultural movement, and it is also urgently needed! However, I feel that there are still a few points: 丨 But perhaps this is just "superfluous"!</p>
<p>1. In discussing scientific theories, be bold and clearly instruct the questioner.</p>
<p>2. When discussing reading methods or indicating reference books, I also hope to pay attention to "concrete application" and avoid abstract jargon.</p>
<p>3. Expand the length.</p>
<p>Below, I write out my questions: 丨</p>
<p>1. In the Japanese translation of "Das Kapital" (Capital) (translated by Takaseki, published by Kaizosha in Showa 7th year), on page 15 of the original author's second edition preface, the second sentence of line 15: (　　　現存　事　態　光明　　　　　　　　　　　　　如　見元　　　　　　). In other Chinese translations of dialectics, it is mostly translated as "confusing reality," only one person has translated it as: defending the existing (roughly like this, please see Wang Lingao's translation of Hegel's "Outline of the Philosophy of History," translator's preface). I do not understand German, I do not know what the original meaning of this sentence is, please gentlemen analyze it.</p>
<p>2. Is there a Chinese translation of Hegel's "Science of Logic"? Zhou Gucheng's "Outline of Logic," which was recently advertised in the newspaper, is it its complete translation? What is the price?</p>
<p>3. Is "Small Logic" another name for "Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences"? Alright, I'll come again next time!</p>
<p>Finally, I must say "me." I am a student of a vocational school who is under twenty years old and will soon graduate. I am very interested in social sciences, and I hope to often receive guidance from you. (Deng Baofu)</p>
<p>The following is a reply to the suggestions in the letter:</p>
<p>1. In principle, I completely agree: but I can only do it within the scope of our ability and "the possibility of facts."</p>
<p>2. The "Reading Q&amp;A" column is only part of the work of this department, that is, the discussion of general reading problems. All those that are convenient for individual replies are not inserted, so some people say that we talk too generally, and there is a suspicion of being unspecific. In fact, this is only seeing a part. Of course, even when discussing general issues, we should also try to avoid completely abstract empty talk.</p>
<p>3. Whether the "Reading Q&amp;A" column can be further expanded depends on the development of our work. The following is the answer to the few points you asked.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the sentence in "Das Kapital" (Capital): 『曾　　現存　事　態　光明　　　　　　　　如　見元　　　　　　』I don't have the German text at hand. According to the English translation by Samuel Moore and Aveling (this English translation is very reliable), the sentence corresponding to this one is...Because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things… It should be translated as "Because it (referring to taking the mystified dialectic, that is, Hegel's dialectic) seems to beautify and brighten the existing things." And theoretically, it must be like this to be consistent with the context. Translating it as "defending..." is not very appropriate, and if it is translated as "confusing...", it is simply incomprehensible.</p>
<p>5. "Small Logic" is part of the "Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences," this is in relation to Hegel's "Great Logic." I have not seen Zhou's translation. Judging from the name he has set, it should be "Small Logic," whether it is a complete translation is unknown. We have not yet seen a Chinese translation of Hegel's "Science of Logic" (that is, Great Logic).</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Six Bureaus</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>In Suzhou, during weddings, funerals, and celebrations, there are so-called "Six Bureaus," which are indispensable servants, as these people are professionals who make a living from it. According to Wu Zimou's "Meng Liang Lu" of the Song Dynasty, under the article "Four Divisions and Six Bureaus for Banquets":</p>
<p>"The Fruit Bureau manages and arranges fruit platters, seasonal fruits, northern and southern fruits, preserved meats, sauces, and decorative fruit arrangements, and offers items for toasting. The Candied Fruit Bureau manages and arranges candied fruit platters, mountain-shaped candied fruits, and decorative arrangements. The Vegetable Bureau manages the platters on the banquet table, providing vegetables for the banquet, exotic vegetables, seasonal flavors, pickled vegetables, and decorative arrangements. The Oil and Candle Bureau manages lighting, upper candles, repairing candles, lighting lamps, arranging seats, holding bean lamps, bamboo lanterns, and arranging charcoal. The Incense and Medicine Bureau manages ambergris and borneol, peaceful and blessed fragrant incense, incense burners, incense balls, arranging incense and cleaning up ashes, listening for incense changes, and offering special sobering soups and pastries after drinking. The Arrangement Bureau manages chairs and tables, armchairs, desks, and sweeping, dusting, and cleaning. "</p>
<p>Today's Six Bureaus have undergone considerable changes. Fruits and candied fruits can be purchased from shops. Vegetables are supplied by restaurants. What the Oil and Candle Bureau and the Incense and Medicine Bureau manage largely belongs to tea vendors, and what the Arrangement Bureau manages belongs to sedan chair carriers. Therefore, although it is called Six Bureaus, it is no longer completely the old system. However, what exists now is often what did not exist in the past, such as music groups, cannons, and external servants (those belonging to the broker's license umbrella), etc. However, "Meng Liang Lu" also mentions the Four Divisions, one being the Account Setting Division, one being the Tea and Wine Division, one being the Kitchen Division, and one being the Table Setting Division, which are still commonly used today. It can be seen that the Four Divisions and Six Bureaus have been passed down for hundreds of years, some surviving, some abolished, some merged, and some combined, resulting in old names but not old systems. The people of the Six Bureaus are of mixed character, and they use all kinds of deceitful means, so if you are not an insider, you will suffer a great loss. Therefore, the accountant becomes the leader of the Six Bureaus, directing and developing for the host, which is in line with what "Meng Liang Lu" says: "The command bureau is divided, it can be gathered immediately, and all can be done according to the ritual." "Only those who are familiar with the work will not lose the festival, saving the host's labor."</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a special organization called Sedan Chair Heads, with designated areas and locations that do not encroach on each other. When a daughter is married and sends dowry, it must be done through these people. As a result, they arbitrarily demand prices, which is frightening. The valuation is mostly hosted by the matchmaker on behalf of the groom's family the day before the wedding. If the matchmaker is soft-spoken and kind-hearted and does not face the market, it is rare not to be ripped off. A friend of mine married a woman, and the estimated value of the dowry (referring to utensils) did not exceed three hundred gold, but the sedan chair heads received a reward of one hundred and twenty yuan. When Wang Yincai was the mayor, there was a proposal to abolish it, but in the end, it was decided that because these people's livelihoods depended on it, it was feared that they would become pests to society if they lost their jobs, so it was not implemented. However, it is ultimately a bad habit, and not abolishing it causes the bride's family to suffer greatly.</p>
<h3>Officiating and Oath-Taking</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>A couple gets married in a magnificent hall, and in addition to relatives and friends coming to participate, they must also invite someone of higher status than the newlyweds to officiate the wedding, and give them words of encouragement, wishing them respect, love, and a long life together. It seems that this marriage must be officiated by the officiant to truly be able to grow old together. What ministers, directors, and committee members swear to take office in solemn halls, also in addition to the participation of colleagues, subordinates, and guests, must be supervised by superiors from their higher-level agencies or send personnel to the scene to supervise the oath, and also give them words of encouragement. It also seems that the oath of office taker to the Premier in heaven must be heard by the supervisor in order to prove and guarantee that they will be able to implement it in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, there are iron-like facts everywhere and at all times to prove that the effectiveness of this officiating and oath-taking has also encountered failure. Officiating is a product of modern marriage, and divorce news has occupied large spaces in newspapers in recent years. Divorce cases are a major business for lawyers and a complicated matter for judges. These many divorced people all invited officiants when they got married, and even the officiant's blessings are still in their ears but they have divorced. What is the effect of officiating? Oath-taking is also a product of the new era. Generally, rebels and traitors, as well as corrupt officials, swear an oath that is so pleasing to the ear when they take office under the supervision of the oath-taker. They accept the oath-taker's words of encouragement more sincerely. However, with the oath-taker's words of encouragement still in their ears, and the oath taken in the oath-taker's ears, they act recklessly. What is the effect of oath-taking?</p>
<p>After officiating a wedding, the officiant considers it a completed task and does not ask about anything else. After supervising an oath, the supervisor considers it a completed task and does not ask about anything else. Officiating and oath-taking are only solemn formalities for weddings and oaths and do not actually contribute to anything later, so I would like to propose here to cancel the officiating thing? What should be done with oath-taking? It concerns the party and the country, so I dare not speak nonsense.</p>
<h3>The Story of Master Cha San</h3>
<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>Master Cha San, whose name was Xiaoshan, was one of the wealthiest people in the late Qing Dynasty. At the same time, Master Sha San of Wumen was also a wealthy man. One day, Master Cha San traveled to Wumen and invited Master Sha San to drink. The food at the banquet was so abundant that it was incomparable. Later, Master Sha San wanted to do his best as a host and return the invitation to Master Cha San. But after thinking about it, he lacked a few famous chefs, so he sent someone to Master Cha San to ask for help. Cha sent fifty chefs to Sha's house to prepare the banquet for him. The doorman of Sha's house saw so many chefs and felt very strange. He hurried in to inform the host. The host personally walked into the kitchen and saw that those in charge of roasting ducks, roasting pigs, making snacks, and washing vegetables and fruits already occupied forty-six people. And only four people were in charge of cooking. Master Sha San thought to himself that his kitchen was too small. Not only were the chefs very inconvenient, but his own face was not very dignified. So he spent three days hiring dozens of craftsmen to enlarge the kitchen. Then he prepared a banquet, sent out invitations, and invited Master Cha San. After Master Cha San arrived, Master Sha San humbly said, "It was prepared in a hurry, I'm afraid it won't suit your taste." Master Cha San listened and smiled, saying:</p>
<p>"In the past, every time I went out, I always brought one hundred and twenty chefs. Later, it happened that the Holy Emperor made a southern tour, so I reduced it by forty people. Now I only have eighty people with me! When I arrived here, I was asked to borrow some, so I only sent fifty people, except for thirty people for my own use. Really! The number of people is small, and the time is short. I'm afraid it won't be as you, the host, intended!" After saying that, they laughed together.</p>
<p>Another time, Master Cha San walked into an antique shop. As soon as he stepped into the doorway, he suddenly heard the myna in the cage hanging on the eaves shouting: "Master Cha San is here! Master Cha San is here!" Master Cha San felt very happy in his heart. A few days later, Master Cha San went to the shop again, and the myna shouted again. Master Cha San really liked it in his heart, so he asked the shopkeeper how much he wanted to sell it for. The shopkeeper pretended to be alarmed and said: "This myna is寄托 from a friend and is not from this shop." Otherwise, I will give it to you as a gift. Why do you need to ask about selling it or not?" Master Cha San called the shopkeeper to ask his friend how much he wanted to sell it for. The shopkeeper went for a long time and came back and said, "My friend is unwilling to sell it." Master Cha San ordered him to discuss it with his friend again, but he was still unwilling. Master Cha San was angry and said: "No matter how much money this myna wants to sell for, I am willing to pay." So the shopkeeper pretended to go one more time and then said, "It won't sell for less than one hundred taels of silver." After hearing this, Master Cha San threw down one hundred taels of silver and walked away with the myna.</p>
<p>Master Cha San carried the myna home with a happy mood. Who knew that after a few days, he realized that the myna he bought for one hundred taels of silver could only shout "Master Cha San is here!" It couldn't say a single other word. After the fact, Master Cha San realized that he had been deceived by the shopkeeper.</p>

<h3>Four Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Drinking and Dining in Merry Farewell, Burning the Midnight Oil with Tender Dreams and Soft Songs</p>
<p>Zi Qiang smiled and said, "I'll listen to you completely. Whatever you say goes." Gui Zhi smiled, "I heard you often sing opera too. Why don't we sing a duet together?" Zi Qiang laughed, "My singing is something I picked up in the summer, so it's a bit rough, but since you've said that, I have to sing. If I don't, I'll be letting down your kind intentions." Gui Zhi smiled, "You sing for me, I sing for you, what does it matter?" Zi Qiang said, "That's right, then I'll sing a section from 'Wu Jia Po'." Gui Zhi smiled, "You should sing 'Fenhe Bay'. When we defeat the Japanese devils, you'll come back and be the Prince Pacifier of Liaoning." Zi Qiang readily took her to the bed, and the two sat side by side. He patted her shoulder and said, "What you said isn't right. Would I suspect you like I did Liu Yingchun?" Gui Zhi smiled, "If you sing 'Wu Jia Po', aren't you treating me like Wang Baochuan?" Zi Qiang said, "I was just saying it casually, I didn't mean anything by it." Gui Zhi smiled, "That settles it. Today I'm being attentive, but I can't be attentive in every way, lest you become too attached to leave. But even so, I only hope that you alone benefit, we don't mind anything. As the saying goes, 'When one person is blessed, the whole household benefits'. Don't you know that my heart is completely set on you alone?" As she spoke, she leaned and fell into Zi Qiang's arms. Zi Qiang held her tightly, rested his chin on her shoulder, and whispered, "How could I bear to leave after you've said all that?" Gui Zhi pushed him away and suddenly stood up, saying, "I'll go make noodles for you to eat, otherwise, the fire in the stove will go out." Saying that, she opened the door and walked out. Zi Qiang saw that Gui Zhi was being considerate in every way tonight, but also didn't want to be too considerate, lest he become too reluctant to leave. So, he put his hands behind his back and walked back and forth in the room, pondering Gui Zhi's attitude. (320)</p>

<h3>Talking About Vacuum</h3>
<p>— Cheng Fanqun</p>
<p>There are many types of vacuum tubes. Any sealed glass tube with several electrodes inside, and with the air inside pumped out to a very low pressure, or replaced with other gases at extremely low pressure, such as X-ray tubes, mercury arc lamps, rectifier tubes, photoelectric tubes, Geissler Tubes, and radio vacuum tubes, are collectively referred to as vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>Is there nothing but electrodes inside the vacuum tube? In reality, even if the pressure inside the tube is reduced to one-millionth of atmospheric pressure, there are still hundreds of trillions of gas molecules inside the tube.</p>
<p>Before explaining the physical concept of vacuum, let's first talk about the structure of gases. At 20 degrees Celsius and 760 mmHg atmospheric pressure, every cubic centimeter of gas contains approximately 2.52 x 10^19 molecules. Now, let's take hydrogen as an example to illustrate the spatial occupancy of hydrogen atoms under the above conditions. Because the diameter of a hydrogen atom is approximately 10^-8 cm, the actual volume occupied by hydrogen is only one-millionth of a cubic centimeter. Although this value is not very precise, it can be generally said that even under atmospheric pressure, there are many gaps between gas molecules. If the pressure on the gas decreases, then the gaps between molecules increase even more. The usual meaning of vacuum refers to the pressure of the gas in a sealed container being reduced to a minimum!</p>
<p>Suppose the gas pressure inside the tube is reduced to one-millionth of atmospheric pressure, such a vacuum can be said to be very high, because this pressure is equivalent to 0.00076 mmHg or 0.0987 "bar" (see note for the definition of "bar"). At this time, the actual volume occupied by hydrogen gas is approximately one-millionth of one-millionth of the space. Therefore, from this point of view, such a degree of vacuum is indeed extremely high.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, any gas under this 0.987 "bar" pressure still has 2.52 x 10^13 molecules per cubic centimeter, or 2.52 x 10^10 molecules per cubic millimeter. Therefore, the space is still filled with gas molecules.</p>
<p>In fact, radio vacuum tubes utilize the phenomenon of thermionic emission, and should be called thermionic tubes to be more accurate. (See pages 43 and 44 of "Radio Reader" by Huang Jiancai)</p>
<p>Note: One "bar" is the pressure of one dyne per square centimeter, and one "bar" is equivalent to 1.0133 x 10^-6 atmospheric pressure.</p>
<h3>Triple Twin Tube</h3>
<p>— Wang Mengcheng</p>
<p>A vacuum tube containing two triodes in one bulb is called a Triple Twin Tube. There are a total of seven electrodes inside the tube, as shown in the attached diagram. The triode on the left is connected to the input circuit and is called the input section; the triode on the right is connected to the output circuit and is called the output section. The two filaments are connected in parallel inside the tube, and a single A battery is used to supply the filament current. However, the filament of the input section indirectly provides heat, causing the cathode to heat up and emit electrons. This cathode is directly connected to the grid of the output section inside the vacuum tube. The output section does not have a cathode; electrons are emitted directly from the filament.</p>
<p>American-made triple twin tubes include the 295 AC tube, the 291 DC tube, and several types used in automobile radios, such as the 293 model. According to experiments, compared to pentodes, this type of triple twin tube can achieve twice the audio power output with the same plate voltage, and the sensitivity is increased by more than three times. The effectiveness is thus evident.</p>
<p>The maximum value of the input voltage applied to the power amplifier tube is usually limited by the negative voltage connected in the grid circuit. Beyond this limit, the total impedance of the grid circuit decreases, and grid current occurs. When the IP-Eg characteristic curve reaches the positive grid voltage section, the plate output becomes distorted. However, with the triple twin tube, both the positive and negative grid voltage sections of the IP-Eg characteristic curve can be utilized. The total impedance of the grid circuit remains extremely high, and the distortion of the plate output is minimal. Therefore, it can minimize distortion and maximize output under the same load.</p>
<p>Among various multiple frequencies connected to the triple twin tube, the distortion of the second frequency is the most significant. The distortion of the third frequency and above is very small and difficult to detect. If the triple twin tube is connected in a push-pull circuit and used, the distortion of the second frequency can be completely eliminated. In public places and movie theaters, it is most important to have a very large and undistorted audio power output. Using triple twin tubes can not only eliminate many stages of audio amplification, but also produce a natural sound quality with minimal distortion.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>The dimensions of the various components inside a vacuum tube must be extremely precise, and the materials must be extremely pure. The measurements used often need to be calculated down to a few thousandths of an inch. For example, the weight of the emission coating applied to the filament is as small as 21 millionths of a pound. All of these components must undergo precise measurements through chemical testing before they can be used.</p>
<p>After the components are prepared, the next step is to manufacture the glass core. A standard length of glass tube is continuously moved by a machine into a gradually increasing gas flame. When the lower end of the glass tube becomes soft like molten wax, a rotating conical mold is used to shape the edge into a喇叭shape, and then another flame is used to cut off the unnecessary portion. The lead wires and supports of each electrode are then inserted into this core, heated to a high temperature, and pressed tightly in a metal mold to fuse them together. Before the temperature of this core cools down, compressed air is blown into the pumping tube to create a hole for pumping air.</p>
<p>After precise inspection, the next step is to assemble the other components such as the plate, grid, filament, cathode, screen grid, and suppressor grid. These components are assembled and soldered by automatic machines, and the speed is truly dazzling to behold. In addition to the above components, there is also a small cup containing magnesium particles, which is finally connected to the grid support.</p>
<p>After the components are assembled and re-inspected, they are sent to the sealing machine. After the glass envelope of the vacuum tube is joined to the core in the flame, it is connected to a vacuum pump to remove the air. During the pumping process, the major metal parts are simultaneously subjected to strong heating by a powerful high-frequency current, so that the gases contained in the glass and metal objects in the vacuum tube can also be removed. When the pumping is about to be completed, the magnesium particles are caused to explode or turn into smoke. This smoke can absorb the remaining harmful gases and condense into a silver film on the inside of the glass envelope to maintain the life of the vacuum. After the pumping is completed, the vacuum tube is automatically sealed.</p>
<p>Then, the lead wires of each electrode of the vacuum tube are inserted into each pin. The glue that adheres the vacuum tube to the tube base and the metal cap on the top of the tube is dried in a baking oven. The lead wires exposed outside the pins are cut off and soldered with solder. Thus, the vacuum tube is completed.</p>
<h3>Quick Method for Determining Vacuum Tube Characteristics</h3>
<p>Although there are many characteristics of vacuum tubes, only the following three are commonly used:</p>
<p>1. Amplification Factor: The ratio of the plate voltage (Ep) to the grid voltage (Eg) required to change an equal amount of plate current is called the amplification factor of the vacuum tube. That is, the amplification factor U equals ΔEp/ΔEg.</p>
<p>2. Plate Resistance: The ratio of the change in a small amount of plate voltage (Ep) to the resulting change in plate current (Ip) is the plate resistance of the vacuum tube. In other words, the plate resistance Rp equals ΔEp/ΔIp. The unit is ohms. (The commonly referred to plate resistance is the plate AC resistance. DC resistance is not commonly used.)</p>
<p>3. Mutual Conductance: Mutual conductance is the ratio of the change in grid voltage (Eg) to the change in plate current (Ip). That is, mutual conductance Im equals ΔIp/ΔEg. The unit is Mho. The practical unit is micromho.</p>
<p>There are certainly many methods for finding the characteristics of vacuum tubes, but most of them rely on sophisticated instruments and complex formulas. The method introduced in this article is based on the above definitions and is intended for personal experimentation by general amateurs. It does not require precise instruments or complicated formulas.</p>
<p>As shown in the diagram, T is an OIA vacuum tube. First, adjust the filament voltage to the specified value of 5V. Assume that when the plate voltage is 135V and the grid voltage is 9V, the plate current is 3ma. Next, reduce the grid voltage to 6V (the plate voltage and filament voltage remain unchanged). Suppose that the plate voltage increases to 6ma at this time. Then return the grid voltage to the original value (still 9V). Increase the plate voltage until the plate current reaches 6ma. Suppose that the plate voltage at this time is 160V. According to the definition in the first item above, we get:</p>
<p>Next, find the plate resistance. Using the same method as above, assume that the grid voltage is 9V.</p>
<p>When the plate voltage is 135V, the plate current is 3m2o. Now, increase the plate voltage to 140V. If the plate current increases to 35ma, then according to the definition in the second item above, we get:</p>
<p>That is, the resistance of a oIA vacuum tube is 10,000 ohms at a plate voltage of 135-140V and a grid voltage of 9V.</p>
<p>(Note: The so-called plate resistance must be accompanied by a description of the conditions under which the vacuum tube was measured. It is meaningless to simply say that the plate resistance is 10,000 ohms.)</p>
<p>Finally, find the mutual conductance. Still using the same method as above, assume that when the plate voltage is 135V and the grid voltage is 9V, the plate current is 3mao. When the grid voltage is reduced to 7.5V, and the plate current increases to 4.2ma, then according to the definition in the third item above, we get:</p>
<p>When speaking of mutual conductance, it is also necessary to include a description of the conditions under which the vacuum tube was tested, because it varies with the plate resistance and plate current. As mentioned above, the mutual conductance of a —oIA vacuum tube is 800 micromhos at a plate voltage of 135V and a grid voltage of 9V.—7V.</p>
<h3>Similarities and Differences Between AC and DC Tubes</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes can be divided into two types, AC tubes and DC tubes, depending on the power source of the filament. However, there is no difference in their functions of detection, amplification, amplitude modulation, and oscillation. Vacuum tubes that use storage batteries or dry batteries to heat the filament are collectively referred to as DC vacuum tubes. Due to the inconvenience of carrying and charging batteries, people then thought about using AC power. However, although DC tubes have a center resistor after applying AC power, the AC noise cannot be completely avoided, so specially designed AC tubes were created. AC tubes usually use low-voltage filaments. Nowadays, there are also AC voltages of several tens of volts. However, most of them are 2.5 volts. DC tubes are 1, 1.2, 3, 3.5, and 6.3 volts, etc. However, due to the inconvenience of supplying filament power, the trend is always to use power-saving types. The current for heating the filament is not large, so the filament is mostly coated with oxide, which can save a lot of power compared to those coated with thorium under the same electron evaporation rate. The opposite is true for AC tubes; the filament current is often above one ampere. Some vacuum tubes, such as 71 and 10, can also be used for AC power because they take longer to heat the filament to a temperature sufficient to emit electrons. When these AC/DC vacuum tubes use AC power to heat the filament, their grid bias is often slightly higher than when using DC power. To avoid AC hum, AC tubes are often manufactured with indirect heating. The so-called indirect heating means that the heating element does not simultaneously emit electrons. The heating element is the filament that is energized, but it is not directly related to the radio circuit. Its periphery is a porcelain tube. When the filament passes current and generates heat, the heat is transferred to the porcelain tube, and then from the porcelain tube to the metal cylindrical plate attached to the outside of the porcelain tube. This metal plate indirectly receives the heat from the filament and then evaporates electrons. The plate of an AC tube also sometimes uses a metal mesh made of tungsten, such as the 27 types. Vacuum tubes that use AC power to heat the filament have a longer lifespan than those using DC power because their filament temperature is more even. The load of AC tubes is also larger than that of DC tubes. The other parts are the same for both types, but AC tubes can be heated with DC power, although they consume more power. However, DC tubes are not suitable for heating with AC power because AC hum is unavoidable.</p>
<h3>The World's Oldest Vacuum Tube</h3>
<p>— RF</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, the world's inventor genius Thomas Edison discovered that when the filament of an electric light bulb is incandescent, if a small metal screen is placed next to it, there will be a current flowing between the filament and the screen. This phenomenon is the basis of the currently used vacuum tube. At that time, Edison specially made several such light bulbs with an extra small metal piece for further experimentation. Carbonized bamboo silk was used as the filament, and a section of thin metal wire was erected on both sides of the filament as a small screen; the filament and the screen were sealed together in a glass bulb evacuated to a vacuum. This special electric light bulb can be said to be the world's oldest vacuum tube.</p>
<p>Last year, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) specially took this special light bulb made by Edison on that day and assembled it into a radio receiver. Its circuit is as shown in the figure, and it uses 110 volts of DC power to heat the filament. After it was made, it was used to receive the broadcast from radio station WJZ, and the sound it received was input to radio station WEAF, which then rebroadcast it for people to listen to. According to listeners at that time: "The sound rebroadcast in this way is still very beautiful and comparable to the original broadcast of radio station WEAF."</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of the diode vacuum tube did not begin in 1904, nor was it invented by Fleming; but its invention actually dates back to fifty years ago, and its inventor was actually the genius Edison. It's just that Edison didn't know at that time that this special electric light bulb had this special function.</p>
<h3>Revival and Use of Discarded Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>Burning out a vacuum tube is indeed the most disappointing thing for amateur researchers. If the filament is not broken, but the efficiency of electron emission is lost, or if the distance between the breaks in the filament is not far, there may still be a glimmer of hope. Various methods can be used to revive it. This method of revival has already been introduced in this magazine and does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>If the broken filament is no longer in its original position, or if the distance between the breaks is too far, and it cannot be revived by the above method, then is it not a discarded vacuum tube? Now I will introduce a simple revival method to revive discarded vacuum tubes, so that researchers can recover a lot of their economic losses!</p>
<p>First, connect the vacuum tube with the broken filament as shown in (Figure 1). Gently tap the outside of the vacuum tube with your finger a few times until you hear a "click" sound in the earpiece. At this time, the broken filament is already connected to the grid circuit (G)! Then connect it to a dry battery as shown in (Figure 2) to see if the filament is bright. Then, burn the outer circumference of the vacuum tube with an alcohol lamp until the glass turns slightly red. After it cools down, the broken filament has fused with the grid circuit (G). Use it as a (diode) rectifier tube with the connection method shown in (Figure 3). Its efficiency and work are no different from a diode vacuum tube. The only difference is that the filament voltage (FF) is slightly smaller.</p>

<h3>Qingbai Basketball Team Defeated Again by the Artillery Team</h3>
<p>Forty to Thirty-three</p>
<p>Fighting the Tax Special Today Afternoon</p>
<p>The Hankou Qingbai basketball team played their fourth match in Shanghai last night. Unfortunately, they were defeated again by the Artillery team with a score of 40 to 33. The score was 27 to 16 in the first half. At 2 p.m. this evening, the team will play the Tax Special team again in the basketball hall. The Artillery team scored nine consecutive points, while Qingbai only scored one basket. After a score of 15 to 2, Qingbai had already fallen behind. Qingbai worked hard to catch up by eight points, but the first half ended in a defeat with a score of 27 to 16. In the second half, Qingbai launched a fierce counterattack, but because they had lost too many points in the first half, it was to no avail. The closest scores were 31 to 27, and 33 to 29. Qingbai scored two more baskets, making it 37 to 33, still four points behind. But in the end, the Artillery team won with a score of 40 to 33.</p>

<h3>Japan Wants to Involve Political Issues by Refusing the Puppet State to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Members of Your House Will Question the Minister of Education</p>
<p>(China United Press, Tokyo, 23rd) The Far Eastern Games will be held in Little Luzon this summer. Japan has been promoting the participation of the puppet state of Manchukuo in the games. Because of our opposition, its intention has not been fulfilled. The Japanese side negotiated with us, but we have repeatedly refused. Although it has induced the Philippines and other participating countries to support its claims, it has still not obtained their support, so there is no way to resolve the matter. Recently, it has aroused the attention of the Japanese political circles. It is heard that Earl Arahara Yoshinori, a member of the Research Council of Your House, plans to question Minister of Education Hatoyama about this matter in the House of Peers on the 28th. It is said that the problem will be politicized.</p>

<h3>World Tennis News</h3>
<p>▲Tilden's Journey in the Far East (London Reuters) Tilden will travel to the Far East to perform in Japan, China, and the Philippines. Japan is eager to have Japanese players compete against the world champion, so they are willing to provide travel expenses and living expenses in addition to a reward of £1,600. Tilden plans to travel 60,000 miles in 1934, starting on April 15th to Europe, where he will perform in Germany, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Italy, Yugoslavia, Norway, Sweden, and other countries. He is scheduled to return to the United States on May 25th. He will go to Japan in early October. Strangely, England is not on his itinerary.</p>
<p>Australia's Hope for the Davis Cup is Not High (Sydney Reuters) According to Malcolm, secretary of the Australian Lawn Tennis Association and a member of the Davis Cup selection committee, Australia's hope of winning the Davis Cup today is no stronger than last year, and not as hopeful as most people think. This is because Japanese players are improving very quickly, and they are becoming more balanced. The United States is also a difficult team to beat. In the current situation, it seems that everything will depend on Crawford alone. In order to make Crawford devote all his efforts to singles, Hopman and Quist have been tested in cooperation, and the results are very good. According to his opinion, Quist is even more hopeful than Crawford.</p>

The United States won all five sets in total. The competition method is the same as the Davis Cup. The United States and France will continue to perform in other cities in the United States.</p>
<h3>The Old Gentlemen Qingbai Game Did Not End in the Slanting Rain</h3>
<p>But Seeing People Fall and Prostrate Themselves</p>
<p>Yesterday was the scheduled meeting date for the Wangping Street Old Gentlemen Soldiers and the Hankou Qingbai team at the baseball field. Although the weather was very good, the punctual and trustworthy Old Gentlemen arrived at the venue at 3:30 p.m. to attend a military conference. The Old Gentlemen who had wives also brought their beautiful spouses and lively children to support them. No one was willing to be a straggler under the mobilization order. This shows the undiminished ambition of the Old Gentlemen in their twilight years. After the Old Gentlemen Soldiers held a military conference and discussed their offensive and defensive plans, they braved the rain to test their feet and waited quietly for the enemy to come and challenge them. At 3:40, the light rain, although getting heavier and heavier, did not stop Director Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Shen Huichun from arriving one after another. One was prepared to throw the ball, and the other was prepared to enforce the law, but because it was still early, they could only watch from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Later, the clock struck four, and the Old Gentlemen Soldiers were ready, but not a single soldier from the Hankou Qingbai team arrived. Everyone knew that the Qingbai team had probably forgotten the agreed time. So, they divided into two armies, briefly practiced, and exercised.</p>
<p>The Old Gentlemen Soldiers were practicing enthusiastically when suddenly it was reported that the enemy was approaching. Everyone looked intently and saw that the Qingbai team had arrived late. Although it was already 4:30 at this time, more than 30 minutes past the competition time, it didn't seem to be a problem in the eyes of people who didn't value time and couldn't keep their word. But since the Qingbai team had arrived, but their troops were incomplete, they had to borrow soldiers from the Old Gentlemen team. So, the Old Gentlemen team, with their abundance of talent, lent four generals to Qingbai, and they began to line up for battle.</p>
<p>At this time, the slanting wind and fine rain surrounded the baseball field. The two armies exchanged artillery fire under Director Pan Gongzhan's wind-assisted ball throw and Mr. Shen Huichun's rain-soaked law enforcement. Unfortunately, not long after the hand-to-hand combat began, the wind and rain grew stronger, and the ground was muddy, making it unsuitable for running. One person fell prostrate on the ground, while another fell face up. Under the circumstances of people falling and horses stumbling, they completely lost their combat effectiveness. The impartial referee, seeing this situation, sounded the gong to call off the battle. The friendly competition ended with no winner or loser on either side.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Baofeng Football Team vs. Special Chinese Police</h3>

<h3>Two Heads of Fujian Education and Construction, Zheng Zhenwen and Chen Ticheng, Come to Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>To Pay Respects to Officials in the Capital Last Night for Consultations</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenwen, member of the Fujian Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Department of Education, and Chen Ticheng, concurrently Director of the Department of Construction, arrived in Shanghai by the new Ningxing merchant ship from Fujian the day before yesterday. They went to the capital last night. It is reported that Zheng's trip was due to the problem of education funding in Fujian Province. Historically, the 110,000 yuan of funding was originally allocated from the salt surplus. After the establishment of the Fujian Provincial Government, all the salt surplus was transferred to the central government. When Zheng took office, the central government had agreed to subsidize the full amount of the aforementioned education funding. However, the Fujian Central Bank refused to allocate the funds because it had not received a payment order from the central government. Therefore, Zheng left Fujian for the capital to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Finance. Chen Ticheng's trip was due to the central government's order to complete the Fujian-Zhejiang highway within a time limit, and it was necessary to consult with the National Government. Therefore, the two went to the capital together and are expected to return to Shanghai and Fujian within three to five days.</p>

<h3>Northern and Southern Literature and Others</h3>
<p>— Gu Ming</p>
<p>Rich imagination is determined by the clear and vast sky, and the dark and deep night; this is the source of religion and literature. If it is an extremely materialistic nation, in wind and sand and hardship, there is not much religion or literature. Examining the origin of the world's great religions, all in what kind of region and natural environment, will be surprised by the greatness of many natural forces!</p>
<p>We have never heard of great literature in Xinjiang, but Tibet has produced world-famous writers. Ordinary folk songs may have literary value, but may not be comparable to Homer. It seems that literature should not be divided into north and south, but from a subjective point of view, there are boundaries that can be divided.</p>
<p>Recently, for the sake of southern literature and northern literature, the Beijing school and the Shanghai school, it was lively for a while. But whether it is Beijing or Shanghai, whether it is surprised or horrified, although it is a school, it is ultimately different from literature. Most of the writers currently writing are southerners, and in the history of literature, it may not be specifically labeled "Beijing Literature". However, after many miscellaneous people flowed to that side, gradually moved into high-rise buildings, relied on the powerful, and there were no competitors in front, they naturally wanted to feel extraordinary and become such a school. Shanghai is the land of foreign slaves, compradors, and hooligans, a place to hide dirt and harbor filth, not a literary environment, which Beijing scholars do not need to know. But if there is literature, it will never be called "Hooligan Literature". Either they are famous by relying on officials, or they are merchants to compete for profit. Both are ridiculed, and there is no need to argue about who is the "orthodox".</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why there are more southern figures than in the north is nothing more than changes in the natural environment. In the distant past, culture moved south, and in recent times, European winds moved east. The northwest was originally a wealthy land, and Wu and Yue were tribes with cut hair and tattooed bodies. Because people used the power of the land without cultivation, the land gradually became barren and the people became poor. Once the forests were used up, the rivers also changed their courses, and fertile land became wasteland. For example, the fire wells in Sichuan, burning for hundreds or thousands of years, will also extinguish. So run to places where life is easy, so move south. The culture of the Yellow River basin has dried up. When it reaches the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, life will become more difficult and culture will decline, so it will end up going south to the sea. At that time, maybe it can be called the "Shanghai School", but then, there will be nothing left.</p>
<p>The South can be considered rich in products, with beautiful mountains and clear waters, so modern times can still produce talents who specialize in dreaming and specializing in ideals, even if they are singing about the wind and moon, it is still in the surplus of material life. If you still hope to have great literary geniuses in the future, please pay attention to the modern material environment.</p>
<h3>The Home of the Malays</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>It was a cloudy day early on Sunday. After eating breakfast, the sun had not yet come out. I didn't know what to do at home, so I wanted to invite a few friends out for a stroll.</p>
<p>Five people were riding four bicycles. Little Ya Zhen was afraid that she wouldn't have enough strength to ride, so she asked me to take her; the road was flat, but by the time I got to the second bridge, I was already behind.</p>
<p>"Work harder, look how far they've run."</p>
<p>She said, patting my spine from behind.</p>
<p>Sweat, like mountain springs, streamed down from my hair, onto my forehead, onto the side of my nose, and onto my neck. I wanted to pull out a handkerchief to wipe it, but if I took my hand away, the car might fall into the ditch; if it was just me, the sweat wouldn't flow so much, and there wouldn't be any danger in taking my hand away for a while.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, the scenery on both sides changed. At first, there were many desolate tombs, and the weeds grew half a foot high. As we continued to run, it gradually became desolate, and the road had no asphalt; sand and pebbles crackled under the wheels. Some coconut trees stood there unevenly, and some children walked past carrying a large bunch of bananas. After passing through a field planted with tobacco leaves, we entered "Ganjiang".</p>
<p>They stopped in front of a Malay's house, arranged their bicycles, and stood there waiting for me. We were familiar with the owner of this house. He came to the city from time to time, and bought rice and cloth in Ya Zhen's shop. When he saw us coming, he was so happy that his two rows of white teeth were fully exposed. He shook my hand to show his warm welcome. Walking into the wooden house, a gust of wind blew in from the back door, and it felt much cooler; the host knew we were thirsty and asked his wife to bring two coconuts. After drinking the fresh and sweet coconut water, she also sent a basket of fruit.</p>
<p>The furnishings of the house were extremely simple. A bed, a table, and chairs were placed in the middle. There were no paintings or photos, nor were there wardrobes or anything like that. Two naked children stared with unfamiliar eyes. Ya Zhen gave them a "rambutan". The taste of this fruit is no different from lychees in Guangdong.</p>
<p>"Why don't you wear clothes?"</p>
<p>A friend asked.</p>
<p>"They don't want to wear them."</p>
<p>"Is it like this every day?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they sleep naked too."</p>
<p>Their sons are so strong, they don't get sick all year round. When it rains, at most they only need to wear a single shirt.</p>
<p>The life of the Malays is simple and primitive. We played there until noon, and the host's wife had already prepared the meal; white rice with chili and dried fish was used to treat the guests. We, who grew up in Malay lands, naturally ate very well, but a friend who had come from China not long ago was embarrassed: only he ate with a spoon, while we all grabbed the rice with our hands.</p>
<p>After playing for half a day, the sun sneaked out at some point. When we went back, my car was loaded with two big durians, which Ya Zhen gave to the friend in the back.</p>
<h3>Heartfelt Condemnation</h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>These past few days, I've become even easier to anger, and poor Li has become my punching bag. She just had a fight with me and stormed off in anger. At the moment she slammed the door shut, I really wanted to run after her and hold her back, embrace her waist with both arms, look at her with pleading eyes, and say to her in a gentle voice: "Sister Li, forgive me, I was just acting like a child. If you really want to go out, take me with you!" But for some reason, my feet were as if nailed to the ground, unable to move. Even my eyes seemed to be covered by a black cloth, not seeing the ground. I heard a loud slamming of the door downstairs - even louder than the one she slammed here just now. I knew she had left, carrying boundless grievances.</p>
<p>Tears flowed from my eyes like a fountain. I wondered why I've been so sentimental lately, crying at the slightest thing. Before, I couldn't easily shed tears unless I used chili peppers to stimulate them.</p>
<p>Sitting blankly, the light of the tears was as clear as crystal, as clean and beautiful as the icicles hanging from the treetops in winter. From this, I seemed to see Li's face filled with anger and sorrow, dragging her lonely shadow through the crossroads, weeping on the rocky mountain. She definitely doesn't want to come back. Alas! Who would want to come back and be subjected to my anger?</p>
<p>Hearing the "ding ding ding" of the bell, I knew the first hour of class was over. The last tear fell, and Mother Li came in. I quickly pretended to be very calm and leaned over the table to write.</p>
<p>My heart was being oppressed tighter and tighter, making it difficult even to breathe. I wanted to cry out loud, or immediately go to the crowded streets to find Li. Even if I couldn't find her, and had to return with disappointment and sorrow at dusk, at least I would have punished myself, taken the punishment myself... Yes, that's it. I'll look for her. And so, with heavy steps, I came downstairs, onto Zhongshan Road.</p>
<p>Men, women, children, old people, even every lamppost, every rickshaw parked by the side of the road, all passed under the sharp gaze of my eyes. But disappointingly, though I saw many wearing light gray cloth qipaos, I couldn't find Li's shadow.</p>
<p>I walked many places and still couldn't find her. I saw that the clock in the policeman's booth already read four thirty.</p>
<p>I don't know how, but I actually ran to the area of Xiamen Road and Kaiyuan Road. At this time, I still hadn't given up hope. I thought she must have gone back and seen the note I left on the table. She should be rushing over. If we could meet here, I would definitely open my arms and hug her, regardless of everything.</p>
<p>Several heavy trucks sped past, dust flying into my eyes, almost blinding me. Following my footsteps, inexplicably, I suddenly came to the seaside.</p>
<p>I can't find her! At this point, I seemed completely despondent. But strangely, my heart suddenly felt much lighter, as if a stone had been dropped from it. There was no longer the anxiety I had just felt, nor any sorrow. I just blankly jumped into a small sampan and drifted lightly to the center of the sea.</p>
<p>The seawater was emerald green, the clouds were blue. In the northeast corner of the sky, floated a few cotton-like, pure white clouds. The unorderly Western-style buildings, under the azure sky, seemed particularly pitiful and boring. Really, I compared these gray Western-style buildings to spirit houses burned for the dead to live in, as if the people living inside were all corpses. Isn't that so? Those who toil all day at the docks and on the streets, where would they find such houses to live in? Only those living corpses, full of food and with nothing to do, have tall buildings to live in.</p>
<p>Because the wind was not strong, there were only slight waves. The boatman rowed very slowly. I felt as comfortable as if I were sleeping in my childhood cradle. Carefully studying the sudden changes in my mood these past few days, it's because my tinnitus has worsened, and my lungs are acting up again. I dare not go to the hospital for a check-up, even though the doctor has repeatedly told me that I must go for a check-up and weigh myself once a week, no matter what. But I dare not go, because I'm afraid he'll nag and say things like rest, get some sun, eat nutritious food.</p>
<p>The boatman asked me where I wanted to go. I wanted to answer him with a poetic phrase: "Let it drift!" But I don't know how to say it in Xiamen dialect. Even if I did, he wouldn't understand. So I just moved my mouth to the left, and he changed direction.</p>
<p>Life is empty, full of suffering. At this moment, I more deeply understood the meaning of this. Although in arduous struggles you can better grasp the meaning of life, it eventually becomes like it is now, when there is nothing left, and the heart is filled with empty sorrow, the bitterness of life.</p>
<p>Gradually, my head became too heavy to lift, and my forehead ached as if being struck by an iron hammer. The warm sunlight made me dizzy. And so, the little boat carried me, drifting for an hour and a half, and returned to the streets where I couldn't find Li's shadow.</p>
<p>Li, I hope you have returned safely. I, who have been condemned by my heart, am now unwilling to see you!</p>
<h3>Cormorants</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>The boat gently glided out onto Poyang Lake. After passing Longkou, what met the eye was countless fishing rafts.</p>
<p>The rafts were all woven from bamboo, narrow and long in shape, with the front end upturned. On top were placed a bamboo basket and a low stool. On a bamboo pole beside the raft, several cormorants stood perched.</p>
<p>The fisherman only needed to bend his waist forward and push with the pole in his hand, and the bamboo raft would move forward like an arrow, lightly drawing two lines of ripples on the water.</p>
<p>The fishing rafts were arranged in formations on the water's surface, advancing in single file, or in a V-formation.</p>
<p>When they reached a suitable stretch of river, the fisherman knew there were many fish hidden in the water. With a shout, everyone drove the cormorants into the water together.</p>
<p>The fishermen shouted "Lu! Lu!" in their mouths, and the cormorants responded to the fishermen's calls with "Jia! Jia!". They slowly spread out.</p>
<p>Some splashed and flew on the water, others leisurely wandered in the water. Green eyes, hooked beaks. Looking around. As soon as they caught sight of a fish shadow flashing in front of them, they immediately somersaulted into the water and chased after it. Any fish that encountered them were like rabbits meeting hunting dogs. Few could escape safely.</p>
<p>After the cormorant caught a fish, it would raise its head, hold the fish in its mouth, and happily swim close to its master's bamboo raft. Then the master would take the fish from its mouth and throw it into the bamboo basket, and immediately take another small fish to feed it.</p>
<p>After eating, it would happily cry "Jia! Jia!" again, paddle away, and resume its fishing work.</p>
<p>In this way, the best cormorants could catch dozens of catties of fish every day. When the weather was clear and the river water was clear and the bottom could be seen, we could sit on the bow of the boat, lean against the awning, and leisurely focus on the water, watching the cormorants chase the swimming fish. Witnessing the struggle of the weak for survival, one couldn't help but feel a little sad.</p>
<p>But even though the cormorants work so hard for their masters, they rarely get to eat their fill.</p>
<p>Some say: It's not that the master doesn't want to let it eat; it's because he's afraid that if it eats its fill, it will become lazy and unwilling to catch fish for its master anymore. This may have a certain amount of truth to it.</p>
<h3>I Curse That Smile of Yours (10)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>But remembering what Old Liu had just said:</p>
<p>"Not a single Baiyi woman came tonight!"</p>
<p>I went to sleep quietly, even though that smile had made me uncomfortable for quite some time.</p>
<p>The next morning, while I was sweeping horse manure in the stable, I peeked from the sparse shade of the trees toward Old Liu's door. That's terrible! The Baiyi women who had stayed overnight at his shop last night were now appearing one by one under the shade of the mango tree by the door, carrying bamboo baskets. Everyone walked in silence, as if in a funeral procession, with none of the vigor they should have had when setting out in the past. Among them, two Baiyi girls, sixteen or seventeen years old, were even more so hanging their heads low, dragging their feet weakly, as if still showing the signs of weeping from the night before.</p>
<p>I felt very sad, thinking and hoping: I hope that unfortunate thing didn't happen last night! I hope that their unhappiness today is because of a lack of conversation among the female companions, a quarrel, or a hair-pulling fight.</p>
<p>However, before it was time for breakfast, the tragic news that had indeed happened at Old Liu's shop had spread throughout every thatched hut in the valley like the morning breeze.</p>
<p>The boss, while eating, talked about this matter, and then concluded with a mocking tone:</p>
<p>"I wonder how much money that old turtle Liu made last night?... Hmph! That old fellow..."</p>
<p>He shook his head, like a moralistic scholar. He had probably completely forgotten about the matter of begging me last night.</p>
<p>"How wicked and immoral!" The boss's wife said this as soon as she heard the boss speak, and now, after hearing the whole story, she repeated this sigh, and then said: "Fortunately, it didn't happen here. Fortunately... your eyes are blind!" She suddenly saw her little daughter dragging her sleeve in the oily soup while taking tea, and that's how she ended the topic.</p>
<p>"Isn't it all the same?" I thought to myself, but didn't say it. I ate two bowls of rice without tasting anything and quietly walked away.</p>
<p>While sweeping horse manure, I thought sadly: Wasn't I the executioner last night? If it weren't for the old fellow's smile, or if I could have kept my face and not gotten angry, wouldn't things have passed lightly like a game? A heavy brick pressed on my heart.</p>
<p>However, just when I couldn't bear the inner reproach, terrible rumors were added from the outside: Last night, I was the one who led the foreigners to Old Liu's house, and passed on messages for him, threatening the girls who were staying there overnight.</p>
<p>This made me even angrier and more annoyed. Thinking of those rumors that I couldn't explain, and the two weeping, defiled girls, I simply hated Old Liu to the extreme. When I couldn't reduce the pain in my heart, and when I saw people's meaningful smiles, I could only angrily shout:</p>
<p>"Old ghost! I curse that smile of yours!"</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, what a weak and emotional person I was! If I had beaten up that lecherous ghost that night and run back to China, or persisted regardless of ridicule, then my heart would surely be clear and free from filth, and I wouldn't feel any pain now.</p>
<p>Whenever I was troubled by this unpleasant past, besides gnashing my teeth and cursing, "I curse that smile of yours!" I couldn't help but think of those brave and resolute people and say enviously:</p>
<p>"You are blessed!" (The End)</p>

<p>Although the gold market opened steadily yesterday, confidence was not strong, the domestic market gradually loosened, and the news was slightly bad. It was difficult to maintain this for long, and the result was extremely weak.

<h3>Foreign Call Loans Made Daily</h3>
<p>Commercial Market Prospects Showing Progress</p>
<p>Recently, the various commercial situations in Shanghai have been showing a promising development towards the new year, so the entry and exit of various goods have also gradually started, and the flow of funds has been increasingly intense. It is a pity that the financial sector has not been able to meet expectations, and the flow of borrowing has caused the market to miss a great opportunity, and the market has never been prosperous. Yesterday, foreign call loans were still made without collateral in the market, and the entry and exit of funds were slightly more frequent. In the call loan transactions, over 1.9 million was transferred in the early market, over 500,000 was newly transacted. Over 600,000 was transacted in the Small General Association, with no added value for the head.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Slight Dip After Frequent Bond Rises</h3>
<p>February Trading Ended Yesterday</p>
<p>Except for 1918 Customs Bonds, All Fell by One to Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange halted trading in February futures, pending settlement on the 26th. Only March futures were traded on the market for one month. The market initially rose and then retreated, experiencing a slight dip. After the opening rally, prices had risen for four consecutive days. This marks the first sign of fatigue. The overall environment remains sound, but the market price has indeed reached a high level. A temporary retreat is expected. However, based on market sentiment, a sharp decline is unlikely. Prices may still rise initially and then fall. At yesterday's opening, various groups continued to absorb bonds, mostly improving by two or three jiao. Since Jin Duan (short-term bonds) Nos. 4, 30, and 38, etc., were actively sold, market prices reversed from high to low, dropping by three and a half jiao. This caused market sentiment to weaken. The entire Sixth Series also followed suit, falling by two or three jiao. In the second round, many retail longs emerged. Major players continued to sell, but in smaller quantities. Market prices then uniformly declined by two, three, five, or six jiao, mainly because the rampant banditry somewhat dampened bullish sentiment among the general public, with no other factors involved. In the end, market prices, except for 1918 Customs bonds which remained good, rising by three jiao, all fell by one or two to about seven jiao. The total turnover was 6,928,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot transactions and 6,935,000 yuan in futures. A comparison table of the highs, lows, and gains/losses is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Price Jumps 1.5 Yuan This Month Amidst Factory Purchases</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon, with the situation gradually improving. Due to the difficulty in lowering cotton prices, a major factory absorbed as much as possible, and the yarn inventory in warehouses slightly decreased. However, ordinary retailers still lean towards selling due to sluggish actual demand and lackluster business in various sectors. As this month's trading is on its final day, a certain factory decided to take delivery, and in the final afternoon session, the price jumped 1.5 yuan to 181.5 yuan, a significant increase of 11.5 yuan compared to last month's settlement price. Considering the overall trend, the yarn market appears to be stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Renbiao Geng Feng Dumped</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Renbiao market, Geng Feng dumped its holdings, causing market prices to weaken, with prices for all months falling by 0.05, 0.07, and 0.09 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in spot prices for the current month, the prices for distant months were stimulated. The current month rose by 2 yuan, and distant months rose by 0.08 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 34,900 bales. It was found that Tongfu sold 2,000 bales, Hengyi 1,300 bales, Geng Feng 6,000 bales, Fuda 1,550 bales, Senkang 1,250 bales, Yuande 1,250 bales, and Xiesheng 950 bales.

<h3>期棉漢帮稍有套出</h3>
<p>Trend Difficult to Lower, No Sign of Decline</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm, but the closure of the US cotton market and slight increase in Indian cotton prices led to moderate market sentiment. The good performance of the yarn market contributed to the stability of the cotton market. Although spot cotton business was brisk, arrivals from various regions were not strong. Some believe that US cotton prices cannot be expected to fall and are inclined to go long on dips. However, it is said that the Han merchants slightly cashed out.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Only Rose Two Jiao</h3>

<h3>Biao Flour Has Floating Shorts to Cover</h3>
<p>Flour Trading Opens All Day Starting Today</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, prices for each month showed an initial flat and then stable trend. Quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago had no market, Canada recovered by about 0.15 yuan. Therefore, after the opening, the market sentiment for each month remained flat. Subsequently, because various groups covered floating shorts, and manufacturers seemed to reduce dumping, coupled with a slight spot business by the Nanyang group, market sentiment slightly improved. However, foreign wheat still remained loose. For example, Argentine wheat was quoted as low as 4.13 yuan, and manufacturers only offered 4.12 yuan, so there was no transaction. According to the trend of foreign wheat, it is feared that it is still in surplus. As a result, this month rose by 0.005 yuan, March rose by 0.0075 yuan, April rose by 0.015 yuan, May rose by 0.01 yuan, June rose by 0.015 yuan, and July rose by 0.0075 yuan. The Flour Exchange will resume normal trading all day from the 24th. It is heard that the Lantern Festival week will not close even on settlement days.</p>
<h3>Factories Continue to Purchase Near-Term Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat market, prices rose consistently in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Due to high prices for futures foreign wheat and sales of spot flour by both Northern and Southern groups, market sentiment improved, and short covering was active. In addition, spot wheat sales were very active, with factories not only purchasing spot wheat but also buying standard near-term months on the exchange. As a result, this month rose by 0.03 yuan, next month rose by 0.02 yuan, and April rose by 0.04 yuan. Distant months had orders for foreign wheat and were new wheat standards, so they were shorted as soon as they opened. At closing, June was down by 0.005 yuan, and July had little activity and no change. Spot Wuhewan wheat opened at 3.389 yuan, Bengbu at 3.32 yuan, and Shandong at 3.47 yuan, totaling 2,100 bags, which were taken in by Fuxin and Fufeng. The market was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>White Japonica and Thin Paddy Fell by One Jiao Each</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods for various groups were still scarce, only Nos. 15 and 16 (amounting to about 20+ shi). Sales were sluggish, and there was no sign of a turnaround. This is mainly because the New Year has just begun. Recalling the major conclusion of last year, inventory was weak. There should have been a period of excitement after the opening of the red market, but unexpectedly, this year's phenomenon is such that it is truly unexpected. Yesterday, it initially felt good, but by the later market, it became sluggish again. As a result, the Japonica from Sudong and Nangang that was received in this street lacked the strength to stand firm and fell by 0.05 yuan. Other Changbang Japonica and Duyang Tip, etc., were out of stock and had no market. Fortunately, the Southern and Northern groups continued to move 700-800 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Fengxian, and Lian evening rice, relying on the scarcity of goods to stabilize the situation. The time for variety transformation has passed, and it is still flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the 23rd and 24th grade goods arrived from various places downstream. Sales of each grade of goods were sluggish, and the market trended further downstream. White Japonica, Yangjian early, and Thin Paddy prices fell by 0.1 yuan. Baiyuan, Yinyuan were flat and tired by a few cents. Bu Jian, Du Jian, and Ke Jian also showed signs of softening.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Demand Strong, Price Falls</h3>
<p>Sales Extremely Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market situation became even more sluggish. Because the transit goods that were initially loaded at the end of the lunar year have now arrived continuously, coupled with sufficient base inventory, the accumulating goods are increasing, and the cargo owners are seeking to sell more urgently. Yesterday, the appetites of local Ke brokers were weak. In addition to the shipments made by the Fujian group a few days ago, there are still 20,000 bags that have not been loaded, so there is a saying that the inventory will be cleared before further processing. Yesterday, it was only intended to handle 2,000 bags as a formality, but the intention was very slack, and it is feared that the realization of another period of slackness will be required in the future. Ningbo and Guangzhou have imported foreign rice to meet the market, and the appetite is very weak. This street pays attention to the arrival from downstream, and the turnover is also minimal. All rice prices have fallen, especially for medium grades. Hunan oily brown rice is still in a state of virtual softness. The market can only turn around if the price drop causes local customers to sell well, otherwise it may continue to be sluggish.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Sales Scarce</h3>
<p>Spot trading of miscellaneous grains is gradually becoming scarce, and the market is flat and tired. Yesterday, the market for yellow soybeans opened with a small grain from Yingzhou, one carload, which was taken away by the Jiangbei group, sold at a price of 2.64 yuan. Also, the Ningbo group purchased 200 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans at a price of 4 yuan. The mainland group purchased 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow, priced at 3.44 to 3.47 yuan. For mung beans, the Guangdong group purchased 50 bags of Guandian Cai Lu at a price of 3.88 yuan, and the Yantai group completed 107 bags of small grain Mingguang Lu at a price of 2.56 yuan. The Fuzhou group only delivered 50 bags of Guandian goods at a price of 6.53 yuan. There were also slightly over 100 bags of Xianhe small grain peanuts traded in this street.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Red and White Sugar Have Not Yet Started</h3>
<p>Crystal Sugar Slightly Opened</p>
<p>The sugar market is watching and waiting for actual sales to begin. Therefore, yesterday the guild's price list showed that 24th-grade coarse granulated white sugar fell by another 0.1 yuan to 17.7 yuan, transshipment goods were 6.6 yuan, No. 9 crude red sugar was 15.85 yuan, No. 8-9 crude red sugar was 15.7 yuan, Taikoo B mark was 20.015 yuan, and W0 mark was 20 yuan. Transactions were all sporadic. No. 1 local factory white sugar remained unchanged at 18.9 yuan. Chaoqing lower grade slightly opened, such as Gao Ban Nan at 11 yuan, and Longjiang Qing at 10.05 yuan. Hongfa Yuanli brand crystal sugar sold a few dozen bags at a price of 9.2 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than before.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for the Silk Market</h3>
<p>New York Standard Silk Prices Gradually Decline Yesterday, according to news from the local American silk merchants' foreign firm, although the consumption of raw silk by New York silk weaving factories has increased, Japanese silk is being dumped at low prices, causing silk prices to gradually decline in the past ten days. The spot price of standard silk has fallen below the US$1.50 per pound mark, a gradual decrease of about 0.1 yuan. The B-grade 82-83 evenness of Shanghai White Factory's silk, the price per bale converted to national currency has also fallen close to 600 yuan (New York delivery).</p>
<p>Shanghai's Stock of Double Palace Silk is Scarce Spring sales of Indian mat double palace silk have started, and demand is high. Only Fuhui Silk Factory in Shanghai is still operating normally, and silk production is limited, unable to meet demand. The British ship Lavalpinthée, which sailed this time, did not transport any double palace silk to India. According to statistics, the inventory of various foreign firms is only about 70 bags.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Actively Handling Pig Lead</h3>
<p>Tea merchants have been actively handling pig lead transactions, and it is heard that 400-500 bars have been transacted in recent days, with the price at 15.3 yuan per dan, for March delivery. In addition, transactions have also been made by yellow lead factories, paint companies, and tin foil factories, so the market appears to be very optimistic.</p>
<h3>現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>Spot Solder Shortage</p>
<p>Recently, spot solder has been in short supply due to a lack of source, and there is very little circulating in the market, so the prices are firm. For example, Xiaoxiao is estimated at 182 yuan per dan, Holland at 218 yuan per dan, Dou at 190 yuan, Fuzu at 220 yuan, Gouguang at 86 yuan, and solder at 70 yuan. It is heard that only miscellaneous solder has been traded in recent days. In addition, Xiaomiao, Holland, and other solder types have had few transactions due to the lack of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Nickel-Krupp New Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>New Nickel-Krupp goods have arrived, with a total of 300-400 dan stored in various foreign firms in Puxi. The public council has priced them at 270 yuan per dan. Transactions have already been made by the Sichuan and Hubei groups, and local furnace workshops have also been buying and selling.</p>

<h3>How Can Such a Political Situation Be Reasonable?</h3>
<p>— Rainy Night</p>
<p>The bribery case of Japanese Minister of Education Hatoyama is causing a great uproar, filled with smoke and dust. Therefore, Ichiro Kiyose said, "How can such a political situation be reasonable?"</p>
<p>Because Minister of Education Hatoyama is, after all, a person with status, power, and means, evidence can be suppressed, and the court dares not accept the case. People with status and power are indeed much better off. However, Hatoyama is still embarrassed and intends to resign voluntarily, not wanting to attend the review committee. Although Minister Hatoyama has high skills, there are naturally some things that are difficult to do.</p>
<p>After Ichiro Kiyose filed an impeachment motion in the House of Representatives, he also requested to speak, saying, "According to what Mr. Okamoto said earlier, Mr. Hatoyama, who controls the cultural hub, after all, has committed criminal acts. Hearing about the suppression of evidence is truly shocking." When Kiyose was speaking, members of the Seiyukai party all roared and cursed loudly, causing great disturbance in the parliament. This is truly unreasonable.</p>
<p>Ichiro Kiyose also said, "Minister Hatoyama evades taxes, the Minister of Finance is an advisor to Yasuda Hozen Corporation, how can we trust such a government? It is strange that the negotiation committee of each faction actually refused to submit a motion of no confidence. How can this be reasonable?" While Ichiro Kiyose was speaking eloquently, the parliament was in great turmoil, and Speaker Akita prohibited Kiyose from speaking. This is also truly unreasonable.</p>
<p>From our perspective, what is so rare about Hatoyama, with his personality and position as Minister of Education, engaging in bribery and tax evasion? Why is Kiyose so surprised? The Japanese are, after all, small-minded and lack the attitude of great citizens.</p>
<h3>The Four of Us</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The Four of Us: Different native places, different personalities, by chance we were united. Although we never made a "we don't seek to be born on the same day, but seek to die on the same day" vow, our four spirits have long achieved this step. Since stepping out of the school gates, we have been separated for many times, and last year in Zhenjiang, by another chance, we took a picture together in Boxian Park. This picture reunited us again this year, because more than two and a half of us are unemployed. One day, we talked about the four of us, and with the majority's consent, we believed there was something worth writing about "The Four of Us." Here, I will faithfully and economically write a short profile of each person; even though I am one of the four, I will detach myself from the "I" position and record it purely objectively. Perhaps the reader can discover "your you" in "The Four of Us"!</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The eldest brother is an optimistic, contented, and law-abiding young man. He stepped out of school with his front foot and stepped into the bank with his back foot. He has a good family, and he is content with his position. And the other three of us, unemployment is often chained together, the eldest brother has not experienced the hardship of unemployment; we naturally cannot disturb his peaceful mind with the pain of unemployment. So when one, two, or even three of us visit him, he receives us like ordinary friends, and our conversations are as irrelevant as ordinary friends. It is undeniable that the eldest brother is the most distant among us; the difference in environment has distanced our friendship, that is a fact.</p>
<p>The eldest brother rose from a monthly salary of eight dollars to twenty dollars a month in the bank. He worked diligently to climb up; although he also made meaningless sighs, saying that banking was not a good career, last year, due to some procedural misunderstanding, he claimed to have suffered a loss of more than a thousand dollars. Finally, he switched from that bank to another bank, and then he climbed up again...</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The second eldest is his grandfather's grandson, but not his grandmother's; and even less his mother's son. He has no father.</p>
<p>In the second eldest's hometown, his grandfather was quite famous. The inheritance he left behind, if the second eldest only played mahjong and hung out in teahouses, he could die without knowing how much a copper coin was worth; but he has been drifting in Shanghai for five years, why? Heaven knows!</p>
<p>He worked as a typist in a foreign firm, a low-level clerk in the land bureau, a primary school teacher, and a newspaper reporter, and he could write some not-so-brilliant essays. In five years, he lived a carefree life.</p>
<p>He had many romance stories. In school, "love expert" was constantly attached to his name; but the beginning of his love with his wife was after marriage, and now he is a father.</p>
<p>He inherited his father's lung bacteria and liked to drink even more. He has not had proper rest in five years, so his medical expenses are a regular part of his living expenses, like rent and rice.</p>
<p>He often pretends to be an old man – a young man of twenty-four! He doesn't recall the past, he doesn't yearn for the future, he doesn't cherish the present, he lives, for life.</p>
<p>The second eldest is "I".</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I don't know how to start writing about the third eldest.</p>
<p>His father died, just when we were united by chance; he has a mother who is not his own mother, who depends on him for survival.</p>
<p>After graduation, a father's friend who his parents entrusted him to, took him into his comprador's office. It sounds like he was as fortunate as the eldest brother: stepping out of school with his front foot and stepping into society with his back foot; however, no!</p>
<p>He bit his lower lip and said to us: "$4 a month only." Naturally, he did not inherit any property.</p>
<p>Later he was sent to the north, without an official position, to the comprador's sole-funded branch company. The manager of the branch company thought it necessary to expel him! Anyone would think that he was a guy who didn't know how to go with the flow.</p>
<p>He took a year's superior salary of thirty dollars a month, and was dismissed by the comprador on the grounds of the branch manager's transfer of responsibility. He is still unemployed, but he has to eat every day. In this respect, both he and ordinary people are the same; and there is still a mother who is not his own mother, who depends on him for survival.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>We all say that the fourth eldest is better than us in any way, but the fourth eldest himself does not admit it. As for what he considers "regrettable" (the fourth eldest's catchphrase), I also know it clearly, but I can't write it exceptionally outside the "faithful" scope. In short, it's a lifelong "regret"!</p>
<p>He is an elusive character. From the time we met until now, there has been no slight change in his behavior. He is the inventor of "Taiwan style". He would rather not smoke at all, but if he does, it has to be Capstan. After the January 28th Incident, he switched to smoking White Golden Dragon, he is a patriotic practitioner.</p>
<p>When he is happy, he can spend the only twenty cents in his pocket to go to the Great World. When he is sad, he drinks at the counter instead. If he has a whole ten-dollar bill in his pocket today, he wants us to find a way to spend the money, the more novel the spending, the better.</p>
<p>It's okay to complain about poverty with him, but he just raises his hands and pretends to be Laurel in distress – but no matter what, he can't pretend as well as I do. If we talk about "regret", he wants to drink. If he has no money, he can borrow everywhere, get drunk and cry, and after crying, he feels too bored.</p>
<p>There is another thing that must be mentioned in his life history: when I got married, he almost broke up with me because of the failure of the bridal chamber hazing. I still think it's "regrettable".</p>
<p>This is the four of us!</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of the Jai Alai Court</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>On Avenue Joffre, the red, blue, and green neon lights of the Cathay Theatre, spelling out words, were already swallowing some foreign gentlemen, ladies, and high-class Chinese. Across the street on Avenue Albert, even more cars were parked in front of the jai alai court, and the people entering the jai alai court were as turbulent as a river.</p>
<p>(This jai alai game was originally a Spanish exercise, but later became a form of gambling. In Shanghai, like dog racing, it absorbs the money of a group of gamblers. And these gamblers include merchants, gentlemen, university professors, movie stars, students, and people from all walks of life.)</p>
<p>Inside the iron net, the ball is being played; outside the iron net, the seats are like mountainsides, and people are sitting, standing, smoking, talking, applauding, and boasting like mountains. On both sides, high up, hung blackboards with white words showing the betting odds. People were shouting along with the markings on the board, "Number two has three points!" "Number two has four points. The seat is secure!" "Number five, two points, damn it!"</p>
<p>The whistle blew, the lights in the arena dimmed, the seats lit up, and the noise rose to a boil. "Number two, five points!" Someone shouted happily. Near this person sat a young couple. Hearing this cheer, the man's thin yellow face turned even paler, and he seemed to be cursing someone under his breath, tearing the losing ticket into pieces. Hearing this cheer, the woman's rosy face turned even redder, her eyes staring ahead, and she also tore the waste ticket in her hand.</p>
<p>"I said number two would definitely come tonight, but you wouldn't believe me!" the woman complained, still staring ahead.</p>
<p>"Didn't number five often come last night? What can I do if he doesn't come tonight? Damn it!" the man defended.</p>
<p>"Someone on Avenue Joffre is calling for rickshaws, wanting two. This is a good sign for number two."</p>
<p>"Ugh, you believe in those things!"</p>
<p>As the man spoke, he ordered the servant boy standing next to him waiting for customers to buy tickets, "Number five, win only, two tickets." The woman said, "Number two, a seat." The man said, "Number two won't come." The woman sneered and turned her face to look at the players practicing hitting the ball in the iron net before the game, her eyes shooting at the vigorous body of the Izasu player wearing number two uniform.</p>
<p>Radio music was playing rapidly. The tide of people surged to the ticket counters in the back, and then to the front of the iron net. The whistle blew, the game began. A moment of silence, only the sound of the ball hitting the hard wall, bi bi. The ball hit the floor, number two, one point, then hit the floor again, number two, two points. The third time, the opponent's ball hit the floor again, number two, three points. People's conversation became noisy.</p>
<p>"Number two will definitely come this time," said the person who bought number two tickets, a joyful and triumphant expression on his face, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Number one is really a rice bucket!" The person who bought number one sighed in hatred, a furious and frustrated expression on his face, throwing the cigarette on the ground and stepping on it.</p>
<p>"Number two, five points!" Someone shouted wildly. Music started, the noise was loud.</p>
<p>Number two won again.</p>
<p>The woman won four dollars and twenty cents for a seat, sneered at the man and said, "Didn't listen to me, has number five come now?" The man said, "You'll see, number five will definitely come this time." The woman snorted from her nostrils and ignored him. The man again ordered the servant boy to buy two tickets for number five to win only. The woman wanted to buy a number two seat, but the man stopped her and said, "Will number two come again this time, silly?" The woman took back the money she had extended, half believing and half doubting.</p>
<p>The whistle blew again, the game started again, and number two was again five points.</p>
<p>The woman immediately stood up, her expression showing a sense of annoyance and contempt towards the man.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Go home!"</p>
<p>"One more game, then leave."</p>
<p>The woman endured, not answering, and sat down. After waiting for a while, she said sharply, aggressively, and concisely,</p>
<p>"Has number five come?"</p>
<p>The man's expression, originally frustrated, immediately turned to disgust and anger when he heard the woman's question, and he threw his cigarette on the ground.</p>
<p>"I'll buy even if he doesn't come!"</p>
<p>The woman sensed that the man's temper was flaring, swallowed her saliva, shrugged her shoulders, rolled her eyes, and endured in silence. The man's temper did not get a response, and instead he spoke softly and ingratiatingly, "What can I do if he doesn't come?" The woman's temper flared up, and she said again sharply, aggressively, and concisely, "Didn't I tell you to buy number two?" The man softened, as if knowing his mistake, and smiled flatteringly at the woman, "I'll definitely buy number two this time, okay?" "If you had listened to me earlier, wouldn't we have won?" The woman also smiled.</p>
<p>Radio music was playing. The tide of people surged back and forth. The whistle blew again. The game started.</p>
<p>The radio music stopped again, and the people's voices also stilled... again the ball was thrown to the salt wall.</p>
<p>"Number three, four points, five points!" The people who bought number three were applauding, this was the only time he came tonight.</p>
<p>The woman, both angry and frustrated, and with a look of deep apology to her husband, said,</p>
<p>"Number two just won't come this time;"</p>
<p>"Let's go back." The man stood up.</p>
<p>The woman looked at her husband with an apologetic expression, and the man stood there looking at his wife's expression, suddenly smiling at her, his anger completely gone, and said, "It's getting late, we still have class tomorrow."</p>
<p>The woman also smiled, put on her coat and followed her husband out of the jai alai court from the crowd.</p>
<h3>One of the Arts of Living</h3>
<p>— Nai Shuo</p>
<p>No matter which way you look at it, in this world, if you want to live a good life, you must learn to be clever. This is absolutely good, no need to say more reasons.</p>
<p>For example, some people vigorously learn from foreigners to give up their seats to women in first-class trams, while others in third-class trams stare blankly with wide eyes at the women who can't stand steadily and sway back and forth, as if they have completely forgotten the foreign etiquette of giving up seats. I can call these people clever, and the degree of their cleverness is indeed considerable.</p>
<p>Originally, for example, taking foreign etiquette as an example, it is only in those places full of foreign flavor that it can be done vigorously. Otherwise, it is a waste of effort. Shouting "Moreton So" or shaking hands is only effective in front of foreign dignitaries or gentlemen who understand this kind of etiquette. If you grab the hand of an old country man and shake it a few times, or say a few jibberish foreign phrases, he will either suspect that you are joking, or he will suspect that you are scolding him. The result will definitely be a boring experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who are generally clever in mind and speech always walk into foreign-style places and practice foreign etiquette. To women who dress in foreign styles, they are like ancestors, as if it is a pleasure and a matter of course to put their butt on their own heads. As for going to third-class trams, they do not hesitate to show that men are kings, and women seem to bring bad luck as soon as they get close to them. So even if people stand until their legs are sore, if there is a place to lean on to sleep, they still have to shamelessly stretch their long legs and sleep.</p>
<p>"Do not speak of the Way to those who are not the right people," is the etiquette of the former kings. To be able to do this under the power of foreign dignitaries, the people are truly rare.</p>
<h3>Modern Celebrities' Painting and Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Pang Jun</p>
<p>The river is like a large round mirror reflecting this verdant spiral peak. Since the Qin dynasty, the guardian's spirit spring has connected to Dongting Lake. Bamboo terraces and many mountains meet the mossy steps. Ten thousand cicadas listen to the sigh. The toilers have no way to climb the Buddha's threshold. The Wuyou Temple gradually becomes densely populated with human smoke. Sedan chairs advance unceasingly, saying, "Following the sloping road, descend the mountain and enter the county court." Green, evil bamboo breeds mosquito air, and immortal thatch makes dog shapes. In the morning, three beautiful things are picked, one for making a decaying age. Emei County, record of Emei travels, recognized poem.</p>

<p>Appreciating the various jealousies of those old spinsters is truly a worldly happiness. Because they always find something ridiculous in others' feelings, they can truly be called people who know how to arrange their own lonely lives.</p>
<p>It is clearly Zhu Meili's lovely flowers, but they deliberately trample on them, only old spinsters can do this. It is clearly a pleasant weather, the best time to throw yourself into the intoxication of a wild outing, but they deliberately curse and insult it, only these old spinsters can do this. They regard love as a sin, and the closeness between men and women as the most unclean behavior in the world, no one but these old spinsters can do this.</p>
<p>These various absurd behaviors, all come from the hands of so-called human beings, which seems strange, but when you think of the fact that even dogs have mad dogs, you don't think there is anything too strange about it. From this, if you reflect and understand it carefully, you may find that this kind of absurd behavior is also an inevitable result of the development of things.</p>
<p>Looking at the fact that old people strictly forbid young people to enjoy themselves to the fullest, it seems that the key to explaining this problem has been found. Like old spinsters, when old people want to carry out their above-mentioned intentions, they always use many ethical and moral terms. Listening to their words, it seems that they are really concerned about young people. But when we press on the true meaning of his words, it is clearly nothing more than a kind of jealousy. Because enjoyment often excludes the elderly, and the victory of love often belongs to young people, but both of these are undeniably desired by the elderly.</p>
<p>Like old people, enjoyment and love are also eagerly sought by old spinsters. However, the result is always being excluded by enjoyment and love. Therefore, thinking that enjoyment can be pursued by everyone, but this is denied by reality, they feel a bad emotion, and in anger, they curse the successful people, which is also a natural fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, thinking of the vixen who scolds the sour grapes because she can't get them, and from this fox turning to this kind of old spinster, if you say that you can't find any fun in it, then you are really not worth talking to.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of a Father's Death</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>"Is your father any better today?" This is what I asked Juan whenever I saw her in the past few days, because she had been frequently asking me for leave to go home early to take care of her father, because her father's condition was deteriorating, and even the doctors had given up hope. I usually knew that Juan's academic performance and character were very satisfactory to me, so I was particularly concerned about everything about her.</p>
<p>"My father passed away at six o'clock this morning." Juan told me with tears in her eyes when I asked her again, "Juan, is your father any better?" "My name has already been registered, but I don't know if I can continue to study next semester, although my eldest aunt's brother always comforts me and says, "Juan, I won't mistreat you in the future." As she said this, tears streamed down her face from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Then, she told me the following: "My mother is nominally in a concubine's position, because ten years ago, my father lost his job, so the family's situation deteriorated. My eldest aunt - my father's first wife - saw that my father was a poor scholar and became disaffected and abandoned my father, taking her own son with her. A year later, my father's business slowly improved and he married my mother. Now I have a brother who is mentally retarded and a younger brother who is still a baby."</p>
<p>Alas! Juan, who is in such a situation, has lost her father, who was the protector of their economy and everything else. Their life from now on is too bleak and miserable! Such a promising person has also lost the gardener who cultivated her! Is this fate?</p>
<p>At this time, the scene of my own father's death also appeared before my eyes. Alas! Juan and I are in the same tragic fate!</p>
<p>If your own mother becomes someone's stepmother, all kinds of troubles and misfortunes will befall us children.</p>
<p>This was something that happened four years ago. The bad news of my father's death came into my ears. After receiving the family report, I rushed home at night for the funeral, because I was drifting at that time. When the sky was dawning, the ship arrived at the port and brought my lonely body back to my hometown. When I knelt before my father's coffin, my heart broke! Alas! My dear and kind father had finally left me and fallen into eternal sleep. Oh! Father, at the ends of the earth, at the edge of the sea, where can I find the father who loved me?</p>
<p>At that time, I still remember my brother comforting me in the same way, saying, "I won't mistreat you." Ah, now, what is the answer in reality?.........</p>
<h3>The City God Temple</h3>
<p>— Wen Li</p>
<p>Who has not heard of the City God Temple in the city, even if they have never been to Shanghai?</p>
<p>This day was the first day of the Lunar New Year. I heard that the City God Temple in the city was the most lively today, so I strolled on the road and walked into the city. The location of the old city wall on Minguo Road was already crowded with tourists and very lively. Walking into the city near the Little World Amusement Park, there were so many tourists that I was squeezed until I was sweating. Suddenly, I heard the wa-wa sound of a car behind me, and I followed everyone to avoid it under the wall. I saw an old man with a leather collar and black glasses sitting in the car, with a delicate wife shaking next to him. They were visiting the City God Temple by car. I wondered if the car could get in. The policemen on duty waved their sticks and shouted for the tourists to move away, but the road was small and there were many people, so the car's prestige had no way to show off. The old man and wife had to walk. If you walk, I will also walk. The tide of people behind me suddenly surged, pushing and squeezing, and the old man and wife were trapped in the middle, floating and unable to breathe. I thought to myself, today it is impossible to distinguish between the rich and the poor. If you don't want to sweat and be crowded, you'd better step aside and turn back. But the old man and wife were also stubborn, and they followed the crowd onto the Nine-Bend Bridge with smiles. As I squeezed along, I looked at the water under the Nine-Bend Bridge, covered with floating green moss and not clear enough to be used as a mirror, and I felt unhappy. Suddenly, a conflict broke out in front, and people shouted and cursed. I stood high and looked, and it turned out that it was a group of women trapped in the center of the bridge, crowded from front to back, unable to move forward or backward, and arguing with the people in front, back, left, and right. Since the center of the bridge was blocked, we couldn't move forward, but we couldn't retreat either, so everyone stopped, and I also stopped. When I stopped, some memories surfaced in my mind: during the annual God Parade Lantern Festival in my hometown, the miserable scene of women being trapped in the center was really ugly. Those hooligans and rascals would grope them up and down, it was simply animalistic behavior, and the women were humiliated, unable to cry or laugh. I looked up at the women on the Nine-Bend Bridge at this time. Fortunately, although they were trapped in the center, they were still able to shout and curse to clear the crowd and slowly moved forward.</p>
<p>After entering the main hall of the City God Temple, the incense smoke made it difficult for me to open my eyes. Unable to see clearly, I had to follow the crowd out of the front hall and squeeze out onto the street in front of the temple. There were many people selling toys and spinning tops on the street, especially one cheap jewelry store where the man calling out to sell had pearl pendants hanging from his ears, a fake diamond necklace around his neck, and jewelry-like rings on his hands, truly a walking advertisement. I turned around to the street selling birdcages. Spring had not yet arrived, and I didn't hear any birdsong, only cages. The tide of people was just surging. I was sweating too much on my back, and my mouth was a little thirsty. I looked up and saw a glutinous rice ball shop on the side of the road. I rushed forward to eat a bowl of glutinous rice balls. The shop was also full of people. I don't know if it was because I was hungry, but the glutinous rice balls were very delicious. People say that the glutinous rice balls in the City God Temple are famous, and I might be lucky today. After leaving the glutinous rice ball shop, I followed the tide of people out again. Along the way, there were people selling flower lanterns and balloons, all red and green. If I had a child at home, I would definitely buy him one or two flower lanterns. Squeezing onto Minguo Road, there were fewer tourists, and I finally took a breath and walked comfortably home.</p>
<h3>The Biggest Hope</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>The diaries I’ve written over the past five years have piled up into several thick volumes. At the beginning of each year, I always write down many beautiful hopes, like a preacher. But when I settle the accounts at the end of the year, I am greatly shocked. It is true that only with hope can you feel the disappointment afterwards. If you live a muddled life like Spring, you probably won’t feel sadness. But I am a person with a brain and thoughts. I know I am deceiving myself, but I will continue to deceive myself year after year until I die.</p>
<p>Now it is the New Year again, the beginning of my sixth year of wandering. Somewhat following my principle of deceiving myself, I write down a few words of hope. However, the quality of these hopeful words has been decreasing year by year. This year, I really can't repeat the kind of hope I had before, because it has given me too much disappointment. So, I avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, leaving some ink marks at the beginning of my diary.</p>
<p>I seem to feel that I am always working hard all day long, physically and mentally, squeezing myself dry. I am worth next to nothing if I were to be auctioned off. Of course, pig buyers choose the strong ones. Regarding this sick body of mine, I want to hope for a great turnaround. My friends who know me know that I go to the doctor for injections every other day. If the needle marks could be left permanently, there wouldn’t be a single piece of clean skin left on my two arms. But it's still useless. I am getting thinner day by day, year by year. I have even fantasized about how thin a person can actually become, and I am using myself as a test subject to see how thin I can get. However, I can't, because even if I don't eat, it doesn't matter, but my wife and children can't go without food. To earn a living, I have to work. So, I get more injections, preparing my body for the day someone will buy it.</p>
<p>Therefore, my biggest hope this year is to be able to lie quietly in a hospital for three months, or even a year, and use scientific methods to increase my weight (the most important thing to declare is that I am not afraid of death because of my thinness; God knows that). However, the biggest problem is that I have never seen a doctor who has the heart to cut a piece of his own flesh to give to me, or who would pay for my medical expenses out of his own pocket. Money, money, money, it twirled around in front of me for a long time. I chose the safest way, buying an aviation lottery ticket. It's a kind of gambling that won’t kill you like smoking or tossing dice, and the "hope" afterwards is endless.</p>
<p>Now I am waiting, waiting for March 2nd to arrive quickly. If readers don’t see Dai Ni's money-making manuscripts in the future, it means he has entered the hospital. He plans to get stronger before being auctioned off again. If any readers want to make this deal, please also hope that I win the fourth aviation lottery.</p>

<h3>Answers to Several Legal Questions (I)</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>As a young and inexperienced person, I naturally have many things I do not understand about the world. Now I am writing down several questions that are lingering in my mind and that I urgently need to resolve, and I ask you to answer them. I believe that a kind and motherly gentleman like yourself will be able to answer me!</p>
<p>1.  My aunt has no son, so ten years ago, she adopted someone else's son. Later, she wanted to raise her own daughter, so she drove the other son away in every possible way. The son, unable to bear the pain, finally returned to his mother's home. However, this son wore mourning for my aunt's parents-in-law when they died, which is customary for a filial grandson. In this case, can this son have the right to inherit the estate?</p>
<p>2.  If the son-in-law of my aunt comes to take over the household and inherit, can he change his original surname? Can close relatives refuse him? Does he have the right to inherit the estate?</p>
<p>Sir: You are the needle pointing south for young people. Please answer the above two questions sincerely! With this I await your reply, and wish you peace. Sincerely, Zhang Peng</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>(1) Adoptive parents can terminate the adoption relationship with their adopted children. According to the law, it should be done in writing. According to what is stated in the letter, the adoption relationship is still in effect, so the adopted son has the right to inherit the estate. However, his share should be half that of a biological child. Also, pay attention to the month and year of the death of the aunt's husband, because only if the death occurred after 1927 does the daughter have the right to inherit.</p>
<p>(2) Although close relatives cannot object to the son-in-law taking over the household, he does not have the right to inherit the estate.</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife (7)</h3>
<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>"It's alright, you go in. Be careful of the wind."</p>
<p>Third Sister laughed inwardly, pushed open the door, placed the lamp on the table, turned over the fire in the brazier inside the fire bucket by the table, and then climbed in, shrinking her whole body together. She looked at the lamplight on the bed, thinking about some past events whose timing had been lost. Her shadow was reflected on the wall, blurred. Her shadow had been reflected on this wall for many years. Although her strong needs in life had never been suppressed, although countless kisses and countless touches had adorned her flourishing years, although she had worn clothes that made men feel willing to serve her, the concrete expression of her life in terms of food, clothing, and shelter was, as she herself understood, not good. Although she had engaged in behavior that violated determinism, her thoughts were deterministic. Her husband was a decorative item in her life. She knew that she would not have the fate to become rich, but she often hoped that she would have a full box of banknotes.</p>
<p>Everything was unusually quiet. There was the sound of gongs and drums in the distance. This sound aroused her nostalgia. The happy and glorious expression she had when she heard this sound many years ago was reflected in her mind. Now, she felt that the sound of the gongs only highlighted her desolation and aging, but everything in the past was blurred. A slight breeze rustled on the low roof ridge. She pulled her head in even tighter.</p>
<p>After a while, the front door rang. Footsteps were approaching. The familiar sound of footsteps made her ears perk up. She hurriedly took the foreign coins from the opium tray in her hand, put them away, and climbed back into the fire bucket. She asked,</p>
<p>"Why are you running back at this hour?"</p>
<p>Xu San, who had originally wanted to come home to rest for the night, suddenly didn't know how to answer. He stammered, "Just coming home to take a look."</p>
<p>He had already walked into the room. He put on a smiling face, looked at his wife's lifeless appearance, and asked,</p>
<p>"Did you lose any money?" He still had a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>"No. How can I always let people lose money?" Third Sister said listlessly, lowering her head again.</p>
<p>"Hmph." Xu San grunted, swallowing the words he wanted to say. He stood next to his wife, wanting to change the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"These two days are the New Year, and you don't even think about making a little more business at the gambling den. Has the ash come out yet?"</p>
<p>"The ash has all come out. At the gambling den." The husband knew that even his miserable work could not be fully enjoyed.</p>
<p>"I have a bit of a headache tonight." She stroked her forehead with her hand. She had eliminated all of his expectations.</p>
<p>"Oh." Xu San expressed his comforting thoughts with a single "Oh." He was silent.</p>
<p>"Take some more cigarettes with you, it's good to make a little more business while you can."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go tonight. I've been working myself to death these past two days. I haven't had a good night's sleep."</p>
<p>"When are you going to be busy if not these two days? Maybe someone will come to smoke tonight. These two days, people are very busy talking and confiding. My headache is like being split with a knife. I might even have to serve people late into the night tonight."</p>
<p>Xu San had nothing more to say. Third Sister wanted him to go up to the gambling den to do a little more business no matter what, giving him many packs of cigarettes. She herself, without any energy, returned to squatting on the fire bucket. Xu San lingered for a moment, believing that her old illness had recurred, and then staggered out of the room. She lazily said,</p>
<p>"Close the door tightly."</p>
