<h3 id="c17">新疆南部獨立之背景　英 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>新疆南路獨立一事。前據塔斯社莫斯科電。「塔什干來訊。新疆南路最大中心喀什噶爾地方。由和闐回族酋長之支持。已樹立新政府。新政府係以該酋長之屬員爲首領。乃一商人出身。名薩畢脫社摩拉。宣稱脫離中國自保獨立。領有整個新疆西南部地叚。同時派遣代表團前赴阿富汗之加布耳進行互相承認之談判。該團並擬赴印度一行。一今又據該社巴黎電稱。時報載杜巴司加文。涉及喀什噶爾樹立新回敎政府事。謂「英國對此西藏附近之反對漢人反對波爾希維克之政府。具有嚴重立塲以援助之」云云此事之内容眞相。究竟如何。尚無續到消息。可以證明。如塔斯社兩日之報告而確。則此事之必有背景已顯然矣。蓋方今世界各資本主義國家。逐鹿於遠東企圖分割殖民地市塲者已久。此項消息。卽足以證明列强陰謀之急劇發展而使吾人怵目驚心於邊禍危機之日迫。并顯示大戰危機燥發之日近一日也　　第一吾人當知此次新疆南部獨立之嚴重性。夫新疆僻處吾國西北爲地方五百萬里。人口約三百餘萬。久爲外力角逐之地。淸代曾一度盡力經營入民國以來。與中國逐漸隔膜。而與蘇聯·印度·阿富汗·波斯·諸國。則反於經濟方面。關係日形密切。現所謂新政府所在地之喀什噶爾。當東經七十五度與北緯三十九度之交。曾於淸光緒七年闢爲商埠。人口約有十萬。倍於新疆省會之迪化盛產羊毛。原棉。五金。之屬。經濟軍事。在在爲南疆之重心。至於和闐則係南部一大農業區域。人口約二十餘萬。素爲回民活動中心。今和闐酋長旣促使其部屬樹獨立政府於疏勒。則據此肥沃形要之地以倡亂可以進擾靑甘。其影響所及。將不只新疆震動已也。</p>
<p>第二吾人研究疏勒獨立之原因。實不能無疑於背後之有人操縱蓋自英人佔領印度統轄阿富汗而後。積極圖謀擴張我國西部。實爲數十年來一貫之政策。昔日不丹尼泊爾之獨立。哲孟雄拉達克之割讓。（光緒十六年事）均爲其積極擴張之表示。此次獨立。如招聘流亡印度日本之反基瑪耳分子</p>
<p>向阿富汗印度進行互相承認之談判。及新政府之首領爲一商人出身則其背影之强大。已可顯見。杜巴司加文謂英國對此。具有嚴重立塲以援助之似亦非無的之矢也。</p>
<p>第三。吾人又知此次疏勒之突發舉動。實出於日軍閥積極完成大陸政策之一種反映。蓋自日本急急侵我東北内蒙以後。野心未已。我國西部英人向</p>
<p>視爲掌中物。今見日人之佈置。力着先鞭。乃不得不一方結援荷蘭成立海軍密約。同時趕速完成新加坡之海軍根據地。一方又運動我南疆回民獨立以防止其勢力之被侵害。其目的所在。已可想見矣。</p>
<p>由上以言。疏勒獨立之事。視似簡單。實具有帝國主義雙方夾攻我領土之形勢。遠東均衡之勢。一經破裂。西南大局。不其危歟。</p>
<p>雖然。吾之此論。僅據塔斯社之消息。亦卽蘇聯方面之消息。蘇聯對於新疆利害關係密切。當然不下於英。故其消息之是否可恃。待將來他方報告以證明之可耳。</p>

<p>生死統計　外僑本年出生率爲千分之一七·八七、此項統計、在本界係初次公布、由各醫師及醫院供給報告、大致尚屬凖確、至於華籍居民、多尚不知登記之重要、且出生之孩、尤其女孩、被遺棄者不在少數、由醫院及醫師接生者較少、故比較正確之統計、一時亦難獲得也、</p>
<p>死亡數目　外僑爲千分之十一·二九、華人死亡率據報告爲千份之十二·八二、（前年爲十七·六五）惟死亡者之中、有百分之四十二、卽五·七一五名、係無主遺屍、是此項華人數目、不足資爲比較、如果施行强制登記、結果或有進境、但因種種之習慣、其不凖確之程度、恐仍不易糾正耳、</p>
<p>傳染病症　本年腸胃炎流行較劇、華人患此者、報告之數大增、而死者亦不少、是殆因報告之不盡正確、或此症在本區特别劇烈之故、又看於腸胃症之多、可見對於食品更應多加注意、雖衛生處已竭力設法保障食品之安全、然居民不可因此便不自加注意也、本年霍亂症並未發生一件、此爲本埠罕見之事、此或因上一年傳播甚廣、故本年多數人均已獲得安全、加以供給平民用水、及施行注射種種預防方法、乃有此成效、抑或因症之循環性、在此年適應潛伏之故、此刻尚不克斷定、但對於來年、則不能便抱樂觀也、</p>
<p>醫院問題　醫院問題調查委員會之報告、經董事會採納後、所議建之西區熱症病院、業由衛生處擬具建築計劃、俟地址擇定後、便當興工、又擬造之神經病院、計劃擬定後、尚須加以修改、又關於私立醫院請求補助費一層、不久當規定一種綱要、對於請求之醫院、在建築上設備上擬定標凖、以期得力、而歸一致、</p>
<p>新建屠塲　本局新建之屠宰塲、經已</p>
<p>完工十一十二月間、逐漸啓用、屠宰完全採用最人道之方法、廢肉處置機、應卽移出塲外、最好卽設在對面地點、至新肉市塲及冷藏間、刻正興建、又局立之屠猪塲、刻正擬擴充、似須别覓一較大之地址、以便充分設備、爲公衆衛生及局方收入起見、對於此項事業、自須逐漸推廣、</p>
<p>牛乳消毒　關於乙等牛乳之强制消毒問題、經衛生處陳述之後、已由局中派一委員會加以研究、尚未畢業、白塌油及植物白塌油之出售、業已施行執照新章、其中攙用防腐劑、限於千分之二、而無毒之顔料、亦准其應用、</p>
<p>學校檢察　凡領受補助費之學校、皆隨時檢察其淸潔狀况、又在年終時已在華人小學一處、着手試行體格檢騐、所有結果、當必極有價値、</p>
<p>宣傳工作　本年因公衆健康良好、故對於衛生敎育、得有若干進展、各衛生分處、及各地廣告牌、已張貼各項新裝之標語圖畫、而電車及公共汽車公司、亦特别恊助、俾在車輛上張貼廣告、</p>

<p>係於民國十八年開辦、十九年十一月、二十年二月、二十一年三月、凡三經改稅、由十八年七月、至十九年十一月、爲七級稅時代、十九年十一月、至二十年二月、爲舊三級稅時代、二十年二月至二十一年三月、爲新三級稅時代、二十一年三月至今、爲二級稅時代、（中略）稅率分級多、則上中下稅之負擔、隨烟質之高下而分别重輕、故下烟之負擔較輕、華商居有利之地位、國產烟葉、亦隨而暢銷、稅率分級少、則上中下烟之負擔、距離不甚相遠、甚或下烟之負擔、超過上中烟至一二部、故上中烟之負擔較輕、英美居有利之地位、國產烟葉亦隨而滯銷、依歷年之經騐、七級稅最有利於華商、三級稅次之、二級則英美顯受特惠、華商無復抗爭之力、故七級稅時代、華商共有百五十六家、二級稅行後、比較、尚多四十一萬零、今則增至加一、而比較郤减到一十七萬、此足爲上烟减稅、下烟加稅之結果、因此英美負担銳减、而華商負担倍增、無怪一年之間、英美突飛進步、而華商之倒閉、幾佔全額三份之二也、謂非稅率不良、有以利英美而損華商、其可得手、政府愛護實業、愛護華商、豈甘出此下策、蓋此中利害、或尚有未明耳、（中略）</p>
<p>本年改稅</p>
<p>之結果、下菸則由値埯抽九十者、增至値百抽一百二十有餘、上菸則田値百抽四十七者、减至値百抽三十六、凡能吸每箱售價三百元之菸者、均爲豪商鉅賈、富有納稅能力、負擔宜重、吸每箱售價一百二十元者、均爲貧苦小民、缺乏納稅能力、負擔宜輕、（中略）或謂三百元以上之菸、現爲一級稅征收一百六十元非不重也、不知三百元以上之菸、銷數絶無僅有、且在非出廠地、復准放寬二十元可謂幾等於零、質而言之、一級稅不過爲稅制之裝飾品實則祗行二級稅而已、三百元左右之菸、祗收値百抽三十六而已、（中略）華商出品之中下菸所用菸葉、爲河南·山東·安徽·所產、美種菸葉、或爲黃岡·均州·鄧·宿松·新昌·等國產菸葉、美種土葉、年產約一萬五千萬磅、售價平均每磅兩角、農户每年收入約三千萬元、政府薰菸稅每百斤四元一角五分、稅收約四五百萬元、其餘黃岡等均州等國產菸葉、每年約產一萬萬磅、政府農民之收入、亦値美種土葉三之一、在七級稅時代、稅率與菸値高下、互爲標準、故國產菸葉最爲暢銷、及改三級稅制、上菸稅賤、下菸稅貴、於是美葉銷路、</p>
<p>紛紛倒閉</p>
<p>今則僅存三四十家、年來且銷數銳减、並多虧累矣、二十一年改二級稅制之始、各地商民、卽以紛紛反對、蓋深知待遇不平、無力與英美相抗、（中略）先言銷用印花、查統稅定章、捲烟每五萬枝爲一大箱、貼用印花一張、是銷用印花數目、卽銷菸之箱數也、在三級稅時代、英美平均數目爲三○四七二、其他公司、爲六八四二二、是英美銷菸數量、僅及其他公司之四成零、不及五成、在二級稅時代、英美平均數目爲四八八○八、其他公司爲四四三二三、則英美銷菸數量、已比諸其他公司超過四四八五、嗚呼、一年之間、英美突飛進步如此、華商墮落如彼、有心人聞之、能不失色喪膽乎、次言</p>
<p>納稅數目</p>
<p>在三級稅時代、英美菸公司平均數目爲二·四一七·四○三·八二二、其他菸公司爲二·○○六·二五二·六四七、是英美之負擔、多於華商四十一萬零在二級稅時代、英美烟公司、平均數目爲二·七二六·三九二·五二二、其他菸公司爲二·五五四·四六六·九九六、則英美之負擔、多於華商僅十七萬零、觀此兩表之比較、在三級稅時代、英美之銷數、雖不及華商之五成、而每月納稅之數目、多於華商四十一萬零、蓋菸質好、售價高、故稅亦重、其理本極順也、今改爲二級稅、英美銷菸數目、前之不及華商五成者、已增至加一、稅率如果公平、則英美納稅數目、至少要比華商加倍、而事實之昭示、所多者每月不過十七萬而已、前者銷數不及五成、每月納稅數目之</p>
<p>奪去國產</p>
<p>菸葉之半、去年統稅改爲二級、下菸更難立足、故黃岡均州等國產菸葉、完全不銷、今年許州·濰縣·鳳陽·等菸葉、與去年比較、葉高價賤、而購者反少、亦受下菸稅重之影響、誠以下菸榮枯、與國產菸葉銷途、息息相關、下菸若以稅重而絶跡於市塲、國產菸葉之銷途、立告斷絶、不特政府菸稅、大蒙損失、農村亦隨而破產、故重稅下菸、不啻自窒稅源、且直接殘害華商、間接戕賊菸農也、此農村破產赤匪鴟張之際、政府能不爲千百萬菸農計、忍置此死地而爲淵敺魚乎、（中略）迫切陳詞、伏祈採納、除分呈外、謹呈行政院實業部·財政部·稅務署、具呈人民衆烟公司·有利烟廠·永和烟草公司·中國大達烟廠·久益烟公司·金山烟廠·華孚烟廠·昌明烟草公司·德隆烟廠·中國華興烟公司·亞洲烟草公司·裕新烟廠·新民烟廠·華美烟草有限公司·華慶烟草公司·金沙泰記烟草公司·上海中國太平烟草公司·上海烟公司·中國大東南洋烟草公司·中南烟廠·克富烟公司·江浙烟公司·和興烟廠·中和烟公司、</p>

<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>現在鄙人研究詩學，有不了然之數點，特此書問。</p>
<p>（一）古詩有無格律？</p>
<p>（二）古詩古今來變化有若干種？</p>
<p>（三）古詩以何種格律爲標凖？</p>
<p>（四）古詩聲調音龍有無止境？</p>
<p>劉秋實謹啓</p>
<p>答劉秋實君</p>
<p>（一）古詩有四言，五言，七言，長短句之别；漢樂府亦有三言者。</p>
<p>（二）古詩之變遷，大率由四言而五言，由五言而七言。長短句卽七言之變化。</p>
<p>（三）除上二條所述外，無所謂標準；惟四言以詩經爲祖，其體最古。</p>
<p>（四）古詩音節，神而明之，存乎其人，無止境。多讀多作，自能漸入佳境。至音韻則另一專門之學，不能作詩爲限。</p>
<p>（代郵）南京田華龍君：請示通訊處，以便函覆，</p>

<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>歲月易得，可怖的「一二八」又湧現在我們—我們中國人—的眼前了！淸朝汪容甫先生有三篇「釋三九」文，把自一至九幾個數字解釋得很是透澈。兹據其說，作「釋一二八。」</p>
<p>在「釋三九上」裏，汪先生劈頭就說：「一奇二偶，一二不可以爲數」；是「一」「二」兩字，已經虛得很。他又說：「九者，數之成也」；則「八」亦非成數。本此解釋，「一二八」那時印象，至今全國人心中尚留存幾許，雖似不能實測，然這三字旣非成數，那末所謂「一二八」，恐亦不過在報紙上，標語上或口頭上曇花一現：結果：恐將隨淞滬彈痕砲迹以俱逝而已。這豈非至可悲痛之事！</p>
<p>試再把「一二八」三字拆開來，取任何二字相加，說也奇怪，其得數亦不能給我們一個圓滿的答覆。譬如一二相加，得數爲「三」。汪先生說：「三者，數之成也」。這「成」字，說得壞一些，就是事實已成，不必再說之意。一八相加，得敷爲「九」。汪先生把這「九」字定爲「數之終」。他還說：「九者，虛數也」。故道「九」字，亦是虛空得很；并且論不定也許就此告個終局。且汪先生又說：「三之所不能盡，則約之九以見其多，此言語之虛數也」。所以無論一八或一二相加，算來算去總是碰壁，不過成爲言語上之「虛數」而已，那末二八相加又怎樣呢？二八相加，得數爲「十」。然汪先生說，「積而至十，則復婦於一」，故「十不可以爲數」；則又是一個空兆。　　姑再把「一二八」三字合起來看，其得數適爲「十一」。「十」旣不可以爲數，「一」又不可以爲數，這不是又撲了一個大空？</p>
<p>總之，這刁鑽古怪的「一二八」三字，推算來，推算去，總是給你一個倒楣，没得出頭的日子；那末，亦祇好說這是中國人的天數罷了。不知全國的「上」和全國的「下」對之，作何感想</p>

<p>— 春柳</p>
<p>從小便被一般人認定我是有些「傻」，雖然，在家塾裏也曾一夜功夫讀完半本詩經；十一歲時候，先生呌我做一首四韻的「賦得詩」，却加倍賣力地做了八韻，但，唯其如此，一般人更說我是傻，而敎授我最久的劉先生，且並添了一個字而稱我是傻氣。</p>
<p>其實，說到「傻」，傻字在字面上也和「獃」「笨」等字不同，是另外有其微妙的意義的，我又何必不做傻子呢？</p>
<p>再細細一想：世界上的大發明家，誰不帶有一點傻氣？試問好好的躺在地上，看見一個蘋果落下地，就要想到地心的吸力；站在水爐旁邊，看見爐蓋子動了一動，就要想到什麽蒸氣作用；明明住在蠻寫意的古文明之都裏，忽然想到水那邊會有一塊空地；要實騐無綫電的感應，紥了一個銅絲風筆放上天去，這些發明家的傻勁，還不够傻嗎？</p>
<p>因爲有些傻，纔能堅定着他的信仰，基於某一信仰而放射出來的理想，纔是眞的理想。西諺云：「理想是事實之母」，我們可以說：「傻氣是理想之母，也便是事實的外祖母。」</p>
<p>我又何必不做傻子？只怕我還够不住做傻子呢！</p>

<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>去年在無錫，記得曾寫過一篇「四多，」佔據了本欄的一角，那是寫的無錫特徴：現在覺得南京，更有其與别處逈異的地方，並且堂堂的首都，又安得没有特徴，因此再作四多：</p>
<p>「機關多」首都也就是我們的國都，國都而機關不多，那還成什麽樣子，所以我們的首都，機關特别多，而以城北一帶尤多，不論大街小巷，無不機關林立，政務方面，自區公所直頂國民政府，黨務方面，自區分部直頂中央黨部，軍事方面自連部直頂軍委會，各級俱全，再加上各項委員會及駢枝機關，眞是氣象萬千，嚴肅之至，有許多學校或印刷所，祗要是官家設立的，必有兵士或警察的門崗在站着。</p>
<p>「官吏多」：機關多，官當然也多，凡政務官，黨官，軍官，等自芝蔴綠豆官以至國府主席中央委員或軍事巨頭，無不各級齊全，所以腋挾皮包，胸佩證章的官員，到處都有他們的踪跡，尤其在星期那天的夫子廟前，簡直碰來碰去，都是證章同志，歌女的書社，和各娛樂塲所，都賴他們而生存，眞是功德無量</p>
<p>「歌女多」：因爲官多，所以歌女也特别多，這些爲生活而賣笑的女子，每屆晚燈初上的時候，都一個個把自己的色相修飾得整整齊齊去供給人家消遣，在表面確是賣藝，但單單一個「藝」字，在中國的價値是幾何？所以伊們爲着要維持生存起見，不得不兼賣伊們的肉體，書社老　對伊們的酬勞是極微薄的，每日僅得幾角，還不够伊們一餐之値，所以伊們的生活，全靠着點戲，而那些主顧們，又焉能没有另我的企圖而來點你的戲？啊！那些已沉淪的不幸的女子，當我路過秦淮河畔，聽到了伊們那種爲飯碗壓榨出來的凄凉的音調，必使我起了無限的戲慨與悵惘！</p>
<p>「乞丐多」：因爲機關多，官多，歌女多，而生產機關－－工廠－－缺乏的結果，造成了乞丐多的現狀，眞是社會的隠憂，在這裏，無論閙市僻巷，遍地都是行乞者，日來氣候嚴寒，一般老的小的衣不蔽體的乞丐，挨户求乞，自朝至暮，川流不息，在店舖住户方面想，固覺不勝其煩，而爲乞丐方面想想，則天寒地凍，同行突增，行乞一日尚不得一飽，也很是可憐，望執政諸公，速籌治本的救濟辦法才是。</p>

<p>冰凍的風，在早晨的路上刮着，像一把利刃；我拉高了領子，畏縮</p>
<p>地打一條偏僻的弄堂經過，弄堂口的右旁，圍着很多的看熱閙的人。爲了好奇心所動，我也邁進了二步，進去看一個究竟。</p>
<p>原來就在人衆的當中，一個奄奄一息的老年的呌化子睡在地下。他的露在蓋着身體的許多稻草外面的臉孔上面，眼睛已是緊閉着了，但似乎是有一部分的肌肉還在抽搐，而且不時還有三口的氣息透了出來。這時候，從弄堂裏來了一位慈祥的婦人，把些銀錠之類的東西放在他身旁，繼着。燃上了些香燭。</p>
<p>我向旁邊的一個中年人問：「爲什麽不送他進醫院去？」</p>
<p>「還有什麽希望？－－凖死的！」</p>
<p>人家已經武斷他凖死的了；而且已跟他放下了些銀錠，點燃了香燭，實在還有什麽話好說哩？於是，我被迫而無言地跑開了，帶着我的悽愴的心！</p>

<p>，早就要你回學校去，我說過了今天再說罷。積之不在意的問道：爲什麽要過了今天再說呢？甘太太道：這理由很簡單呀，不就是讓你去喝今天的喜酒嗎？積之道：呵！你</p>
<p>說的是對門的喜事，我和趙家也没有來往。甘太太道：這眞奇怪。照規矩，凡是街坊，都應該下一分請帖的，而况男女兩家，你都認識的，不應該把你忘了。我聽說，左右街坊，趙家都請了，就是不請我家。厚之笑道：他一個當兵的人家，我們也把不上和他計較。他們夫妻閑話，積之聽着，心裏十分難受。故意鎭靜着，在後院閑話了一會，然後再回到前面來。那惱人之軍樂聲由遠而近，接着很長的爆竹聲，許多人嘻笑喝彩聲，足足閙了有兩小時之久。積之對於這種聲音，本來是懶去聽得，但是自己也不明白是何緣故，旣不願意躱到後院去，避開這種聲音，也不願意再攤開書本，借故來消遣，只是呆呆的坐在屋子裏，把這聲音向下聽了去。約莫有一小時之久，那七巧八馬的聲音，隔了幾個墻頭，隠隠的還可以遞送過來。憑這一點，知道趙楊二家的賀客不少。再揣想着，桂枝和趙自强，又應該是多麽快樂，自己偏是不幸，趕回海甸來，聽了這種快樂。他沉鬱着想了許久，實在是隠忍不住了，還是避到上房去，和兄嫂談話，把這聲音閃開了。到了晚上，自己睡在床上，心想，我把這些不相干的事情，完全抛到一邊，依了哥哥的話，明天我還是回到大紅門敎書去。（二三一）</p>

<h3 id="c167">二個對於礦石收音機很重要的問題 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>諸位可曾注意到二個對於礦石收音機很重要的問題（一）什麽礦石效力最大？（二）礦石檢波器爲什麽要用礦石？</p>
<p>關係第一個問題的答案，現在終算進步得多了，我們平常用的礦石，大槪是硫化鉛（Ｇalena），硅石（Ｓilicon），硫化鐵（Ｉron　Pyrite），和鉬（Ｍolybdenum），最近的發現，以爲銅和養化銅連在一起所生的效力最大，總之，在没有發現一塊效力更好的礦石以前，我們姑且認爲末一個是今日最完備的答案。</p>
<p>講到第二個問題，現在談不到最充足的解釋，都不過在捕風捉影罷了，據英國伊克耳施博士說（Dr·Ｗ·Ｈ·Eccles)，檢波器裏有電流通過的時候，礦石上會發生一種熱電作用（Thermo_electric　effect)，這種電力的本身，具有檢波效力，Ｐhysical　Peview的編者哥德氏（Ｒ·Ｅ·Ｇoddard）認爲這說較有理由。</p>
<p>不過，一般人的意見以爲礦石檢波完全根據「表面工作」（Ｓurface　Work）所謂「表面工作」，就是說；礦石和金屬針接觸的時候，他們表面上的電子蒸發不同，接觸點當然起了不同的阻力，結果賦予了礦石一個單傳性，因此，礦石有了檢波的效力。</p>

<p>礦石收音機因構造簡單，應用機件無幾，故其弊病之發生，自不若眞空管收音機之煩雜。且其弊病之原因，亦易於尋覔，病源旣明，則補救之法，易如反掌。兹將礦石機之通病，病源及其補救法列舉於下，以資參考。</p>
<p>（一）聲音逐漸輕微：此種通病共有四種病源：</p>
<p>（一）礦石檢波器之靈敏度低下：關於礦石優劣之試騐，雖有種種方法，但欲試騐原有礦石之靈敏度是否低下，祇與新的靈敏度較高的礦石相調換試騐之，則可解决。更換新礦石試騐之結果，倘聲音仍然逐漸輕微者，則其病源不在礦石檢波器，倘聲音響亮，則病源必在礦石。</p>
<p>（二）聽筒之靈敏度减退：此種病源多因聽筒内磁石强度之微弱與聽筒接綫之絶緣不佳所致。</p>
<p>（發見法）更換聽筒試聽之，並除下聽筒而測騐其絶緣。</p>
<p>（補救）拆下磁石，使其强度强化，但此種補救方法一般人不易施行，可帶注修理公司囑其修理。</p>
<p>（三）綫圈之動作突變惡劣：因濕氣等而低落靈敏度。</p>
<p>（發見法）拆下可疑的綫圈而調換新綫圈測騐之。</p>
<p>（補救）晒於陽光使其乾燥。</p>
<p>（四）變量電容器之靈敏度低下：爲塵埃濕氣等所侵而絶緣惡劣。</p>
<p>（發見法）調換電容器測騐之。</p>
<p>（補救法）拂棄塵埃而乾燥之。</p>
<p>（二）聲音突然輕微：</p>
<p>（一）礦石檢波器之靈敏度突然低下：礦石受打擊過甚，或因落雷而受電的衝擊時，則靈敏度突然低下。</p>
<p>（發見法）與新礦石相比較。</p>
<p>（補救法）調換感度靈敏者。</p>
<p>（二）天綫與樹木或他物相觸，或斷綫：（發見法）調查天綫有無與樹木或他物相觸，或斷綫。</p>
<p>（補救法）修好天綫之短路及斷綫部分。</p>
<p>（三）地綫之斷綫：</p>
<p>（發見法）調查地綫，或臨時另作接地以測騐之。</p>
<p>（補救法）接續斷綫部分。</p>

<p>圖中之Ｌ１爲摇鼓式綫圈，初級以二十八號漆包綫八十圈繞於四英寸直徑之圓筒上，次級爲同上所用之綫與圈數繞於二英寸直徑之圓筒上。Ｌ２以二十四號漆包綫九十圈繞於三英寸直徑之圓筒上，於其中心引出分綫一根以接礦石。Ｌ３爲二十八號漆包綫四十八圈繞於一英寸之圓筒上。此綫圈關係全機之選擇性，最好拉出幾個分頭以供調凖。Ｃ１與Ｃ２乃兩只·０００３５mf可變電容器，此兩只電容器如用同軸式亦可。Ｃ3爲一只·００１mf的可變電容器，係用以調節天綫者也。</p>

<p>鑛石杯可以平常牙膏管上之錫蓋，或獵子彈之槍彈壳後部置發火藥之小皿代之。</p>

<p>華商紗布交易所標凖紗、自民國十年七月一日開拍以來、卽以十六支人鐘紗爲標凖、同時日紗亦可代用交解、至十四年五卅慘案發生後、乃將日紗等級除去、專用華紗爲標凖、十支粗紗及二十支細紗一律加入抵解、至十八年投機家印商喬直夫組織多頭公司、購進三月份標紗六萬包、猛力軋空、發生絶大風潮、一般賣方以漲勢猛烈、難以支持、馴至虧耗倒閉者甚多、最高價曾達一百八十三兩、（此時呌價用上海九八規元）結果空頭損失共計二百萬兩之譜、紗商旣遭此大難、遂要求改訂標凖範圍、採取擴大主義、將全國華商紗廠一併加入等級、凡漢口天津無錫常州太倉南通諸廠所出之紗、皆列在等級表中、迨至前年一二八滬戰發生後、滬廠停工三閱月、交易所亦停拍、隨時代之進化、改拍二十支細紗人鐘爲標凖、此係標凖歷史上之一進化也、嗣至去年十月十六日、全國經濟委員會、有棉業統制會成立、首先對於紗價加以維持、迄未見若何效果、推厥其由、實以農村破產、金融枯涸、紗銷滯鈍、存貨日厚、加以世界棉業亦不振、市價遂難穏定耳、據市塲上謡傳、謂某大廠陸續將紗解入交易所倉庫中、計龍船採花人鐘等紗有二萬包以外、此項棉紗品質較次、市價被其壓低矣、因此對於標凖牌問題、遂有改革之動議、且於五月期及六月期標紗停止開拍、並聞本月八日已經開會討論、有改用二十支金雞紗爲標凖之說、但有一部份經紀人反對、故尚未公佈實行、容再探明續誌、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈平疲之象、</p>
<p>以洋麥報價、芝加哥小四五角、坎拿大不二角左右、故開價後、近遠期人心均不佳、本月份并以交割已近、一部分浮多、急於回出、市氣頗見鬆動、低至一角四分、遠亦同時鬆落、旋以多頭拉進、又稍回振、迨至下午開盤、各月份仍不見佳、惟本月份多頭、因市面之傾落、出而維持、逐盤收進、數量不少、回此市塲人心、均爲帶起、比較上午之最低盤、回起頗巨、結果本月份較前日反好五厘、二三月份好一分二厘半、四五月份好七厘半、六月份好五厘云、</p>

<h3 id="c233">「送去看」與「拿來看」 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 元固</p>
<p>據說東西兩方文化一天天接近了，實屬可喜之事。這應歸功於洋鬼子所發明的輪船，火車，飛機之類！以及他們所開的蘇彝士河，所修的西伯利亞鐵路。咱們，大國民風度，皇帝的派頭，公子哥兒脾氣，一一拿來享用，可喜可賀！</p>
<p>但在文化上我們也博大得可以！漠不關心。日本人倫了咱們的文字，美國人又學會了麻將牌，據說法國人還學了咱們的烹調，最近轟動上海之海京伯馬戲團也還有敝國人使槍弄棒。咱們的文化不久要同化世界了！可喜可賀。但，都由牠！</p>
<p>且說敝國近來有位外國人很崇拜的「大師」，帶了一大批畫，這包括吳昌碩，陳師曾，趙之謙諸人的作品，去征服德或藝術界去了。此人曾經在外國跑了兩趟，學會了那一套油腔，回來向敎育部里送了一個呈文，實在是比他的藝術品還要永久的傑作。其中講歐洲人對於他的作品無一不崇拜，眞是高高在天！而已往歐洲的大大小小的藝術家，都恨不能鑽地一出，來驚歎他的作品。也許是在官言官，不得不然吧！無如咱們也不管牠，卽算此人的藝術征服了全世界！　不過這兒我們要問，這些東方近代人的畫「送去看」了，也許還賣掉幾張，但有什麽德國近代偉大的作家的畫「拿來看」没有？照道理德國敎育部應該迅派大員，將博物院中許多名畫取了下來，送到上海來開展覽會，以答謝這種敬意才對。但這却對於德國人，據知道德國藝術情形的人講，是絶對不可能的。</p>
<p>其實這也是無關大體的事，東西洋藝術絶不相通。兩國文化要接近，也許在千年後。不過咱們永遠是奉獻出去，要給强者享受，取用，開心。正如爲什麽農業民族自己作許多菜乾，儲藏乾魚肉，要提防游牧民族一來，通通搶光，没有食物了。這時德國雖閙糾紛，但也還是「民康物阜」的時節，足以「致」東方藝術品，如漢代之「致」駝鳥，葡萄。而幾個流氓於賣窮當光之餘，却想因家藏的這一點點東西而得法。民族愈衰弱則做出來的事愈「巧」，這也就愈近於滅亡！再「巧」下去必至「送去看」也無需，那時大槪要什麽藝術也没有的。</p>
<h3 id="c234">文壇的現狀 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 谷遠</p>
<p>這時代有點特别：不僅政治上的怪狀特别多，卽文壇上也是牛鬼蛇神，百出不窮。</p>
<p>正和大人先生們之以小𠶭囉爲進身的階級一樣，文人學士們也呐喊着，呼號着，以同道者們爲踏步而爬了上去。當他們在呐喊着，呼號着的時候，是隠藏了开发的劣點｜特别是過去的缺憾，以博得讀者們的同情的。</p>
<p>當他們在博同情求羣衆的時候，他們是熱烈的，是前進的，是顯着全新的面目而出現於文壇上的。他們攻擊着舊的一切，他們要破壞，燬滅舊的基礎，而創造一個新的；他們是表現</p>
<p>着一個革命者的大無畏的精神的。</p>
<p>這一切都和初出茅廬的政論者相同。</p>
<p>他們爲羣衆所注意了，爲讀者社會所喜愛了；乃至舊的勢力也視之爲新人的領袖，新人的代表而與之暗送「秋波」了。</p>
<p>在這時，他有了社會上推不倒的地位，他無須乎靑年人的擁戴。他的勢力伸張到舊勢力的圈裏去。他成了舊勢力的一員；舊勢力歡迎新加入的有力份子；他也傾心於擁護舊的一切｜他要更向上爬，踏着别一種階梯。</p>
<p>他完全成了另一種人物，完全現出原來的猙獰的面目；他不再號呼，他不再呐喊，反以他人的熱情的號呼爲足擾其淸閒的生活。他知道了一切的新舊文壇秘訣，他知道怎麽迎合舊的勢力以創造自己新的地位，同時他也知道怎麽誘惑着後來者，怎麽去蒙蔽他們的耳目。他是一個「過來人」；較之一切舊勢力都更可怕的一個足以領帶了一班盲目的靑年們向牛角尖鑽去的「過來人」。</p>
<p>他們的大胆，他們的善於逢迎，善於創造自己的新的地位，乃至他們的無恥，都是舊勢力所未曾具有的。孔子殺魯大夫少正卯，道：「天下有大惡五，而盜竊不與焉。心逆而險，行僻而堅，言僞而辨，記醜而博，順非而澤。少正卯兼有之，不可以不除。」道正是他們的罪狀！</p>
<p>每當一個文壇上新的勢力興起的時候，總會有這樣的一種人；所謂博大名，成了文壇柱石的人物，像王世貞，陳眉公，袁子才等等，無一不是如此，而今日則尤多。</p>
<p>自舊式軍閥以至新式流氓，無不視他們爲同道的人，彷彿藥中的甘草似的，無往而不宜；而他們也便「所如輒合，」水乳相融。</p>
<p>舊勢力在暗地裏失笑，高興：「擒賊必先擒王，如今新興的王是被擒在我們手裏了；他們畢竟跳不出我們的手掌心兒。想不到他們是這樣柔順，知人意！」而有了若干新人物點綴於其間，也够足表示他們是「新」了。｜｜而這個保護色便使他們不必摇身一變也就相安無事。</p>
<p>那些進身到舊的勢力圈裏的人物們，也在暗地裏失笑，高興：「原不過作爲進身之階。過了河還留着橋作什麽用呢？」敎援升木，爲虎添翼，他們是怎樣的爲舊勢力助威增勢！</p>
<p>原來是截然分明的兩個不同的界綫的；前進或後退，到新的來或向舊的去。不容你躊躇，不容你徘徊，不容你依違兩可於其間。但見在是陣綫混亂了；他們領頭兒在帶領一部分靑年們向舊勢力妥恊，納欵；而同時却還儼然的擺出一副新的領袖的面目。他們的讀者社會未盡覺察出其鄙劣的行爲，他們的羣衆，對之也還保留一部分的信仰；他們以新的領袖的資格出賣，但同時又利用舊勢力以鞏固他們的地位。</p>
<p>這影響便够糟：一部分更年輕的人們，震惑於他們過去的呐喊與呼號，幾乎帶點迷信的過分相信了他們，便天眞的也開始對於新的陣綫發生了疑慮，動摇。做古律詩，寫詞度曲，乃至學刻圖章，練辽｜一切都恢復了光宣和民初的熙熙攘攘的風氣。說起來該怎樣痛心疾首！</p>
<p>想不到變得那末快！從打倒舊詩，提倡新詩，一轉臉便再度寫起什麽「詞」來，從說是要把中國舊書一槪抛却的話，不多幾時便在鼓吹作賦！提倡寫文言文，多看舊書，說是要從舊書獲得些什麽。</p>
<p>假如要說什麽革命的「投機」份子的話，這一批文人學士們便的眞不假的是「投機」者流。</p>
<p>他們也正和政治上的投機者流相同：以同道者們爲進身之階。一踏到了階梯的最高級，便立刻捐棄了他們。</p>
<p>今日在大學裏主張着大學生要寫文言文的，還不是那一批在新文化運動裏打滾出身的人物；今日說是要塡什麽詞，要讀什麽古書的，還不是在新文學潮流中搶得了上風的份子們。</p>
<p>投機者們的眞面目終於是猙獰的顯露出來。</p>
<p>於是乎陣綫整個的混亂了；誰都忘記了黑幕派所留下的罪惡是怎樣；而他們也便混入新的陣伍裏來，所謂「新人」們也不再喊呌，不再向舊的勢力進攻，而且也便在從前視爲敵人們的營壘裏成爲「帮閒」者。</p>
<p>新和舊是混雜着，新和舊是恊妥着，他們對峙着的陣綫是被移去了。</p>
<p>天下遂以太平無事；恢復了光宣民元的熙熙攘攘的情形。</p>
<p>然而天下果眞太平無事了麽？</p>
<p>另一個新的陣綫，新的壁壘却正在樹立着。</p>
<p>一批過去的新人們是被舊勢力圈所吞噬了！然而終將和舊勢力同走上燬滅之途！</p>

<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>或謂溥儀又做皇夢。予則以爲彼非做皇帝夢，過皇帝癮而已；殆石敬唐之不若，張邦昌劉豫之類也。張邦昌之僞國僅四十餘日，劉豫之僞國亦止七年。溥儀之僞國，縱長於張邦昌，未必不短於劉豫，竊號自喜，能幾何時？雖然，如嗜鴉片者，明知其爲毒害至烈，但能過癮，遂不顧一切以求之。有皇帝癮者，雖臣皇帝，姪皇帝，兒皇帝，孫皇帝亦樂爲之，降而至於土皇帝，匪皇帝，亦可也。</p>
<p>新莽之季世，公孫述據蜀，欲爲皇帝。夢有人語之曰，八厶子系，十二爲期。覺謂其妻曰，雖貴而祚短，若何？妻對曰，朝聞道，夕死尚可，况十二乎？遂自立爲天子，號成家。晋咸康中，李壽據蜀，亦欲爲帝，命筮之。占者曰，可數折天子。其屬任調喜曰，一日尚爲足，而况數年乎？解思明曰，數年天子，孰與百世諸侯？壽曰朝聞道，夕死可矣。任侯之言，策之上也。遂僭卽帝位。此過土皇帝癮者也。</p>
<p>又晋安帝時，王始聚衆於太山，自稱太平皇帝，號其父爲太上皇，兄征東將軍，弟征西將軍。慕容鎭討擒之，斬於都市，臨刑，或問其父及兄弟何在？始答曰，太上皇帝，蒙塵于外。征東征西，亂軍所害。惟朕一身，獨無聊賴。其妻怒之曰，止坐此口，以至於此！奈何復爾？始曰，皇后！自下豈有不破之家，不亡之國邪？行刑者以刀環築之，仰視曰，崩卽崩矣，終不去帝號！此過匪皇帝癊癮者也。</p>
<p>嗚呼！石敬唐之過兒皇帝癮，石重貴之過孫皇帝癮，固已醜矣。然南宋自孝宗以下，過姪皇帝癮而不恥，則於過臣皇帝癮之張邦昌劉豫又何譏焉！第未知今之溥儀過皇帝癮而居於何等也？</p>
<h3 id="c236">評「妬誤」（續） <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>從這里我們可以看出上次世界大戰的罪惡，人類流血的犧牲的浪費。歷史的事實已經淸楚地展在我們的眼前，歐戰是帝國主義分贓不匀所引起的戰爭，而參戰國的人民又正困苦於</p>
<p>生活，厭倦於生活的鞭笞之下，希望着一種巨大的刺激和鼓動來變一變他們的生活，於是就迷於所謂正義和愛國等虛僞的口號，被利用着，送到戰爭的前綫去了，這些人們如果是死了的話，那倒是有福的，因爲他們没有機會再來嘗受戰後意識淸醒過來的更銳烈的新的苦痛。很顯然地這些人們是盲目的，這戰事是没有理想的混戰，他們的犧牲是没有絲毫的代價，在如醉酒似的狂亂之後，他們淸醒了，他們所看到的只是損失，他們落在失望的深淵裏，這失望甚至剝奪了他們的一切的生命力，他們的唯一的希望，卽是想藉着那次的戰爭改變了他們的生活，創造出一條新的生活的道路，而這終歸也成了夢想；並且在戰前，無論如何他們還有能力支持着生活的重擔，而到了現在，他們或是在心靈上，或是在身體上，成了殘廢的人，仍然把他們抛進許久以前同樣厭倦同樣困苦的生活裏，那是比死在火綫上更爲難堪的事。</p>
<p>「妬誤」中的這位中學敎員的丈夫安得烈，便是這樣的一個好例。四年的俘虜的生活毁盡了這個人。他的身體雖没有殘廢，我們却可以看得出他的心靈的暗疾，他的妻說，他需要一年的休養，那是太短了，他需要終生的休養。可是他旣回來之後，還得要作着討厭的中學敎員，還得要作着他的妻子的丈夫，困苦地盡一切作人的責任，他忍受不住了，這時，無論什麽一點點的小事，都能成爲生活的破滅的原因，對於妻的疑慮或妬嫉不過是一個偶然的機緣而已。</p>
<p>所以，說是因爲妬嫉破壞了這個人的幸福的生活。那是不大使人信服的，而且這罪過完全放在這位丈夫的身上，也是不對的，不過在作者所述說的這事件中，妻是處在被動的地位上而已。像她的丈夫一樣地，勃朗施是過了同等的四年俘虜的生活。受着同等的苦痛。按照社會學者的羅索對於戰事人民的心理的分析，這些女性是和男人們一樣地中了魔，她們雖不能親身到前綫去，可是她們鼓動着她們的丈夫，歡送着一切到戰綫上去的兵士，因爲她們也是同樣地被過去的生活的厭倦和困難壓迫得不堪了，她們也是在希望着一種新的生活的開創，可是戰爭的結果呢，却只帶來了傷害，生活却還是走上舊的軌道，而且是更凄慘了。所以那代表這些女性的勃朗施，想到美國去尋求新的生路時所說的話，是最能表現她們一般的心理的了。在這劇裏，勃朗施雖然是寫成了被動的，然而若在另外的人生的劇本裏，她不可以處在主動的地位麽？如果說成爲主動的確實是男性多過於女性的話，那不是因爲世界大戰給與他們的刺激和苦痛的程度的不同麽？戰爭給與他們的苦痛的份量是和他們反抗舊軌的生活的力量成爲正比例的。</p>
<p>請看，全劇中只有安得烈的父親在戰後是没有什麽大的失望，他也同樣地經受了四年的痛苦，可是他兒子能够回來，他便没有什麽不滿足的了，因爲他已經是一個七十五歲的老人。當安得烈對着他表示出他的疑怨的時候，我們聽見老人這麽說：「……啊！算了罷，讓我們安靜點，你回家了。你女人愛你。你還不滿意麽？我可以用我的頭來擔保她没有對你失節。但假使她對你失了節時，你現在閙又有什麽用處？替我守分安命的過活着不要再想旁的得啦。大家都這樣不幸過來。」他是不理解他的兒子的，他不能明白安得烈不滿的眞實的原因。</p>
<p>我在開頭說過，據我的意思，這書的原名「重燃壞了的火」是比「妬誤」更能表現出這劇本的意義，但如果以那長久别離的夫婦的愛情的破裂，看爲是重燃壞了的火的話，那是錯誤的。受了毫無意義的世界大戰的騙，使他們對於新生活起了的希望，而這希望毫未得到滿足，才是眞正「重燃壞了的火」！</p>
<p>從這劇本我確實看出了這意義，而這意義也是全般地眞實表現在劇裏，雖然作者並未能明晰地說明，而它終不失爲一個深刻良好的戲劇。這劇給與我們的最大的敎訓是，上次的世界大戰一塲毫無利益的混戰，它只給歐洲人民更加上一層難堪的痛苦，此外什麽都没有給我們。（完）</p>

<p>她看見那女客好像是傷傷心地摇了摇頭，可是她自己的心中却漸漸來得高興，因爲想到這回答是十分恰當的。</p>
<p>「眞是這樣子麽？」</p>
<p>女客像是不大敢深信她的話。她没有再說什麽，只點着頭。</p>
<p>「今天晚上他到那裏去了？」</p>
<p>「看一個友人，要很遲纔得回來的。」</p>
<p>「那麽請你告訴他，說有一個女人來看他，｜｜明天，明天脫不開身，我是不能再來了。」</p>
<p>「您不告訴他您的名字麽？」</p>
<p>她故意如此地問着。</p>
<p>「我想他該記得，你也該，｜｜時候不早了，我想我該走了。還有些事想要問問的，不過是太給你麻煩。」</p>
<p>「没有什麽，你有什麽話儘管說吧。」</p>
<p>「他没有和你提過一個女人的事情麽？」</p>
<p>「没有，他從來不談女人的。」</p>
<p>「你知道你的母親麽？」</p>
<p>「我不知道，我没有母親，我從來也不知道我還有一個母親的。」</p>
<p>她遏制了胸中起伏的情感，故意這樣漠然地說着。她却望到那女客用明亮的眠睛望着她，好像是在說着這樣的話：</p>
<p>「你不是没有母親的，在你眼前的就是你的母親，你是眞的不知道麽？過來吧，孩子，我知道我是錯了。我不配做你的母親，你生下來我便没有給過你一點母親的愛，現在來吧，孩子，讓我來抱抱你，親親你。」</p>
<p>她懂得這些，可是她忍住了，不爲所動，她看到女客的一雙眼是包了一層薄薄的淸淚。她却故意把眼睛閃過去，做成没有看見的樣子。</p>

<p>於精神生活之表現，卽認定世事烟雲人生蒭狗，因之處事抱定宗旨與人無爭，得過且過，甚麽國際競爭民族生存，大可付之不聞不問，戴東原所謂「險夷原不滯心中，萬斛浮雲過太空」之意。不急燥，不動怒，凡事含蓄包荒，悠徐不迫，有此修養，自有精神上的勝利。至若社會道德，尤爲我文明古國所擅有。對人講信義，寗可天下人負我，不可我負天下人，自己雖吃苦，自有公理伸張於異日。禮讓更爲我國文明所在，君子絶交不出惡言，表面上仍可保持友誼關係，禮也，不奪人之所好，讓也。慕索里尼之所以認爲東方文明具有「靈魂」與「思想」，大槪是據此云然，是他「了解亞洲所存的一種心理」罷！</p>
<p>不過以前英國向印度表示親善時，也說印度是古代的國家，贊美那兒所盛行的佛敎的淸凈無爲，是印度文明精萃的所在，盎格魯薩克遜與大梵民族的團結，可以征服西班牙法蘭西的侵略與屠殺。以後，英印的「團結」，到確實成了盎格魯薩克遜民族的「歷史基礎」，英國文明由此而興，但從西班牙與法蘭西下救助出來的印度，則不堪聞問。同樣英國在埃及法國在安南也玩過這一套把戲。因此這一「希望東西民族融洽」的亞洲學生大會，其實質并不在反對「缺乏靈魂與思想」之文明，而在於一，藉東西民族團結挽救世界文明危殆的蜜語，以示好於遠東民族，使在地中海與法國相軋轢的意大利，得伸展勢力於遠東。東西民族團結者，與「同文同種，共存共榮」具相同的實際含義。二，贊揚東方民族消極的民族性，使意大利於伸展勢力於遠東之日，仍自在提倡「東方文明」的美名之下，不得頑强抵抗，而保持着東方民族「精神上的勝利」。</p>
<p>保持東方文明，養成精神生活，恢復舊道德，曾一時在中國鼓動過，現在這一呼聲已經很低微了，這并不是已經被缺乏靈魂與思想的西方文明征服。不用說保持東方文明的提倡，在生活中已全部採用，卽或西方文明的勢力再如何征服中國，變成第二印度安南也不要緊，外國的兵艦大砲始終衝不破我們「靈魂」的屏障，「精神上」還是勝利！</p>
<p>自然，這一精神上的勝利，將來也就是慕索里尼「東西民族團結」的勝利。</p>

<p>人類的進化到了最高度，生存競爭也更劇烈更緊張了。達爾文那個「物競天擇，適者生存」的大道理，竟支配了我們人類整個的行程，而「强權卽公理」，也跟着在這個世界稱雄了二十個世紀。單從生命的寳貴這一點上去玩味這個結局，那是多麽悲慘，多麽悽寒！</p>
<p>那些强者動手凌夷弱者，優生學家却忍着心腸硬說這是優勝劣敗，硬說這些弱者没有在這個世界生存的權利，這又是多麽悲慘，多麽悽寒！</p>
<p>世界是强者角逐的塲所，大家都要爭强稱覇，於是戰爭出現了；運動戰，遭遇戰，國境戰，攻城戰，防禦戰，殱滅戰，消耗戰，空戰，陸戰，海戰，飛機，坦克，魚雷……各種戰略戰具也都發明和應用了。這個世界上就到處有着慘澹的破壞和殘暴的殺戮，到處可以目睹到對於戰爭的凖備和戰爭的鼓動，英雄主義，愛國主義，鐵血主義！這些好聽的名詞，也常常掛在那些强有力者的身上或嘴上，他們自命不凡地握着拳頭，荷着槍桿，欲在這世界上顯一顯身手，那卽是說要對於弱者加以無情的屠殺，務使其在這世界上不能生存。</p>
<p>人類要求生存，就得捲入這個戰爭的漩渦，個人要凖備由死而生，國家要凖備因戰而敗，我們睜開眼一看；這世界不就是這樣一幅畫圖麽？｜｜强者歌着勝利之曲，弱者吟着悲哀之調。</p>
<p>達爾文的學說，原是生物進化一個極正確的理論，不幸把理論運用到社會問題上，便發生「强權卽公理」的鐵則，蹂躪了無數的生命，至今還把人類陷於萬刦不復之深淵里。</p>

<p>。這自然是根據優生學家的道理，作强文强種的打算，這其中是含得有戰爭的爆炸性的，那些英雄主義，愛國主義，鐵血主義者流一種偉大抱負也就在這其流露出來了。</p>
<p>德國民族在這世界上算是最優越的了，然而大戰以後，卽受着列强的宰割，至今還不能翻身。這是德國人最可悲可慘的事，起來做圖强的凖備，天理良心，這不能說它不應該，只是這一面積極圖强，凖備反抗，那一面也稍極圖强，凖備壓制，世界這般紛紛擾擾，人類底命運又要註定在這刦運之中遇着悲慘悽寒的日子！</p>
<p>「德國將有四十萬人消滅生殖機能」，這件事所引起的未來的事變，或者德國强大起來壓制别人，或者再敗下去永遠受别人的壓制，無論如何，這都是人類生存最大的禍害，最大的威脅，而我們生在這個世界上，就只聽到這樣一些凖備戰爭的呌聲，感着這樣一些禍害的威脅，有誰在這世界上作着和平的凖備？有誰想到「消滅生殖機能」的這四十萬人的生命的悲苦？</p>
<p>也許中國是一個道地的和平主義者，中國人大槪都是「生殖器的崇拜者」，所着「多福多壽多男子」的想頭，所以殘廢者可以養下不成樣的兒女，靠着這兒女供養他一生，有錢的可以買婢蓄妾，養育幾個，十幾個，二十幾個兒女以娛晚年。就是朝不保夕的窮苦勞動者，以至托鉢行乞的癟三們，飯吃不飽不去管，兒女總得育它幾個，這羣小生命便被抱着，牽着揩着，跟着他們的爺娘挨餓過日子。</p>
<p>但是，這個和平主義者太文弱了，於今受着「强權卽公理」的列强勢力的凌夷，發不出一點反抗之力，他只是忍氣吞聲，有時還要花言巧語，以傅强者之歡。然而這弱者之裠里，却自己一點不</p>
<p>客氣，動輙干戈舞動，大興問罪之師，閙得這塊國土没有一片乾凈地！</p>
<p>人家在這世界上凖備戰爭，我們在這世界上裝做和平，然而這裝成的和平，能够掩飾文弱的態度嗎？能够粉碎「强權卽公理」的鐵則嗎？</p>

<p>— 劍仁</p>
<p>因爲有一個同事結婚，照例在人情上大家是要凑一份禮物的。但是，送什麽好呢？老於世故維君說，最好是送錢。因爲在這年頭，大家缺乏的都是「她」，並且這比什麽都實在些。「讓他倆自己去辦禮物罷！如果他倆不需要買什麽，這可以拏這點錢折作酒席費，不是更體諒朋友嗎？」維君的話博得了大家的贊同，於是將許多「份子」用一個大紅紙套裝起來。</p>
<p>接着發生的問題，是這紅套上應寫幾個什麽字。要旣不陳舊，又不傷雅，大家想了半天，都睚含笑不語，拏着一桿毛筆在手的我，這時有點爲難起來。　　萍提出四個字，是「龍鳳和鳴」。</p>
<p>「太舊了」靑說。</p>
<p>「我覺不以爲它太舊，不過……」我說。</p>
<p>靑反駁我道：</p>
<p>「你不過什麽？說呀！」</p>
<p>「我想到了一篇關於「龍鳳思想」的文章，我不喜歡用上面這兩個字，致於</p>
<p>「和鳴」這兩個字，我是完全同意的」我說。</p>
<p>「你是談哲學，我門完全不懂。」靑說。</p>
<p>「還是不懂的好，你一懂了，就有點難受，說不定一個人就不想結婚了。哈哈」</p>
<p>「這是什麽妙論，說點我們聽聽好不好？」從不開口的靜，到想聽妙論了。　　「這是一篇故事，不！是一篇哲學的談話。裏面說的是！做父親的總是想望兒子成龍；總是省吃减用替兒子去找鳳。等到龍鳳喜餅一經吃下，兒子不久也就做父親了，可是，自己並未成龍，祗得轉過來再希望自己的兒子。這位作者於是論斷道：「成千成萬的靑年被龍鳳思想害了他們，他們以經騐未充，學問不足，身體欠强，負擔過重，損害了他們一切的成就，許多天才都就此埋没了斵傷了，社會上蒙了極大的損失。人們仍舊笑吃着龍鳳餅子，穿着龍鳳花紋的服裝，用着龍鳳花紋的器具。被一團悲哀，沉悶，徬徨，朧朦的空氣籠罩着隨着時光老人一步一步的向前進！」這話不也有些理由嗎？</p>
<p>「有理有理！這篇文章過於山格夫人的一篇演講啊！」維君很有點澈悟。</p>
<p>「我不贊成！我不相信一個人的不長進都是爲了結婚，都要怪女人！」靑在替她們女子抱不平！</p>
<p>「哈哈！你說的也有理！你是擁護「龍鳳和鳴」的？」</p>
<p>「呸！我嫌它舊了。」</p>
<p>萍再提出了「造化小兒」，也被靑否决了，因爲有點傷雅，雖然萍引了許多「民族主義」的話，也不能和緩靑的否認的堅决。</p>
<p>最後，還是老於世故的維說，等我來，何必在這幾個字上面用工夫呢！他搶着筆在紅套上寫了二個大字：「道喜」。大家都無異議的笑允了。因爲這二字旣無新舊可分，也是雅俗共賞的。維確是一位精明的能人。我心中想道。</p>
<p>不料，靑這反沉默了。</p>
<p>「你還有什麽不滿呢？」維問　　「我覺得，人生總是苦惱。在一個人的結婚，又有什麽喜可道？譬如健這次結婚，就是他的痛苦的開始，這兩個字不過是在嘲笑他們。」</p>
<p>「哈哈！」維笑道：「靑小姐也要做哲學家了。不過，年靑的人也不要太認眞，要困難總是要困難的。到了某時且說某時的話罷！」</p>
<p>「你自己倒是一個「到了某時且說某時的話的哲學家喲！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！」大家都笑了，維得意的道：「好個利害小姐！我們何時來「道」你的「喜」呢？</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>本月廿日，貴報業餘信箱所登一職工膳宿問題」，細讀之下，覺此問題并不如余君及貴主筆所說之嚴重。蓋在此時代最怕失業，如有二十二元之職業。只要「有打算」，不怕没辦法的。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友張君，他到上海二十餘年，初時薪水每月只有十五元，現在也不過四十餘元。他辦事的時間。是八時至晚六時，機關只供午飯，與余君相同。他有三種辦法：（一）絶對不帶家眷到上海，因爲這是最不合算的。（二）有時租住擱樓；有時四人合租亭子間，分上下鋪，臥上鋪的每月出一二元，臥下鋪的加倍。（四人總有一個有熟人的，不致無眷不租）（三）午飯吃個飽，早間吃糯米和油條，夜間吃粥和大餅。所以他每月個人用度，從前不過五六元，現在也不過十元。</p>
<p>我不願多費貴報地位，不再多說，我們想，照張君的辦法，不是一切都可解决了嗎！　楊頌淸謹啓</p>

<p>大胖子張先生忽然衝破室内的沉默，大驚小怪的神情先表現在他的大面孔上，然後說：</p>
<p>「令天時報不是登着一個靑年投黃浦？人傑怕是……」</p>
<p>這話確實是引人注意，可是立刻被小鬍子黃先生一句話駁開了。黃先生說：　　「那是一個淺薄的學生。有遺囑說是不忍看中國的淪亡，不是他。」</p>
<p>「而且，」我添上去說，「人傑是一個意志堅强的人，他最反對自殺，他說自殺是弱者的行爲，可恥的行爲。」</p>
<p>「他不是失戀的嗎？失戀的人自殺是常事。」</p>
<p>大胖子張先生還堅持着他的見解。</p>
<p>「那要看是怎樣的一個人呀，像人傑那種英雄氣槪有思想有作爲的人，怎麽可比？」</p>
<p>小鬍子黃先生又駁開了。</p>
<p>大胖子張先生點了一下頭，吸了一口烟捲，默認這話有道理，大家也沉默着。</p>
<p>忽然那位瓜子臉上安着一個紅鼻子雷先生，尖聲地呌着起來說：　　「喂，我幾天前和人傑在談天，他大大的稱讚着東北義勇軍的勇敢，說他們幹得有意思，怕是投義勇軍去了？」</p>
<p>「我也曾經聽他說過，怕就是這！」大胖子張先生附和着。</p>

<p>（十五）「怒吼罷，中國！」導演應雲衛（上）</p>
<p>假使我們認爲一九三三年還値得記憶的話，那末黃金大戲院公演的「怒吼罷，中國」，决不會在我們的記憶中消失的了。現在，這一位導演己從舞台移至銀幕了。爲了他是値得我們注意的人物所以特訪問他於藝華公司。</p>
<p>坐在火爐旁邊，我請求他給我們談話了。</p>
<p>「你敎我說什麽好呢？」他說：「我不是還没有電影作品問世嗎？這可使我太爲難了。」</p>
<p>「我想這是没有關係的，反正你的作品在不久的將來便得和我們相見。現在就請你告訴我們由舞台走上銀幕的經過罷」。</p>
<p>「由舞台到銀幕自然是很平凡的現象。這對於我並没有什麽特别値得談及的地方。其實，我對於舞台劇的興趣，完全是由於電影而來的。因爲我以航業爲職務的關係，十年來，没有機會走進電影界，只好在業餘的時間中，從事於舞台劇的嘗試。這從「威尼士商人」直到去年演的「怒吼罷，中國！」爲止，使我在戲劇方面獲得了不少的經騐。但是業餘的戲劇，終於因着種種的關係，不能使我們得較好的成績，這因爲從導演到舞台的小工，都是業餘的嘗試。同時，公演一次，不能維持一星期以上，而且舞台的租金又貴，亦不是减低座價延長日期的條件，因此，外埠的人，不能趕來看戲，大多數觀衆又因拿不出太高的票價，不能普遍。所以公演一次，費力不少，而所得的效果，却不及電影那般宏大。加之，近來我深覺得航業不能使自己發展。與其偷空的幹戲劇，到不如直接了當從事電影。不消說，在電影上，祗要努力一次，便可以在各地公映，永遠存在。這便是我加入藝華的動機了。」</p>
<p>「關於舞台劇和電影的關係，先生可不可以簡單的說到一點。」我問。</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c244">評「今古奇緣」Berkeley　Square <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鹤</p>
<p>|福期出品。國泰開映｜</p>
<p>我們看過那大規模攝製的「亂世春秋」（Cavalcade）之後，那導演Ｆrank　Llovd的名字，不會中使我們立時忘記。現在他又有了這Ｂerkeley　Square問世了。　　他是英國人，在默片時代，他有「某夫人」等名片。那些作品，過去在美國博得好評，特别是「某夫人」及其他「尖塔之聲」等，被公認爲他的生平傑作。及至聲片時代，有人認定Ｌove　Ｒcmance形的作品，並不是他的拿手好戲。至於所謂傑作者，更是不可復得。</p>
<p>「亂世春秋」在上海開映時，我們大槪都十分欽佩他考古的精神，以及那不惜工資的大塲面，大佈景。然而在作品整個的方面說，却不免過於注重於故事的發展，卽如我們所說的「走故事」的影片。特别是沉悶，晦澀，不爲一般觀衆所歡迎。固然，我們不否認他對於劇的每一塲面，處理得非常縝密周到，然而故事過於冗長，而一般觀衆又不能細味對白，於是他只落了個賣力不討好的結果。</p>
<p>現在我們再來看這所謂「今古奇緣」罷。他的作風，仍然和「亂世春秋」同樣，慢的調子，靜的氛圍，極端沸揚，而努力抑止着的感情，哀怨而悠長的傷感，細緻的幽情，這些，無疑義都是浪漫主義的特長，而對於知識階層之羣，確是深深的被它所感動的。</p>
<p>自然，這極端的Ｓentiment對於努力振作的靑年，决不是良好的東西，特别是對於被現實所磨折的靑年，將受着一種不良的麻醉。我們固不必直覺的指斥那靈魂不滅之不通，因爲我們早已認定「少年維特之煩惱」類似的名著，决不是現代良好的滋補品；何况在靈魂不滅之中，求得戀愛至上主義的結論。</p>
<p>當然，我們决不會充耳不聞劇作者咒咀現實的詞句，以致消極的表現對於現社會的憂怨，當那史丹狄以另一世界人之資格而告訴十八世紀之死人們以現世界文明的時候。然而這又是多麽怯弱可笑的啊！</p>
<p>至於如說明書上所解釋的劇旨，那簡直是和影片恰得其反了。難道這「今古奇緣」確是在做反面文章麽？我們認定這種解釋是不能挽回作品之錯誤的。</p>
<p>前面說過，我們如僅以鑒賞者的眼光，而純客觀的去接受這詩一般的技巧伯時候，對於感情豐富而迷纞於舊型藝術的人們，一定會感受某一程度的滿足。然如以批判的學習爲法則的時候，却使我們肯定這是死了的藝術，墳墓中的遺骸。何况根本就没有非主觀的存在的理由。對於任何事物，必定是客觀的事實，加以主觀的理解。離開自己的立塲而成爲純客觀的俘虜，到底不是我們所應用的態度。</p>
<p>看過本片之後，使我們立刻回想到瑙瑪希拉主演的「天長地久」，更使我們記起那影片中的勒斯利好華（Ｌeslie　Howard)。他在「天長地久」中的多情公子的風度，又在這一影片中敎我們認識了。這大槪是他自己的個性，無論在「歌盛恨史」或是「秘密」中，仍然同一格曲析表演。至於那英國女兒飾海倫安琪兒（Ｈealher　Angel），雖然我和們很少見面，却敎人們長留着可愛的印象。那端莊靜穆而又多情的姿態，不是很容易給人好感嗎？</p>

<p>聯華二廠，近來風行着置簽名册請同事朋友們簽字以留紀念。最先的是「風」的導演吳村，跟着就是「漁光曲」的導演蔡楚生，演員王人美，黎莉莉，最近「體育皇后」的導演孫瑜也來一册。吳村的一册，最爲小巧玲瓏，有如他的人一般；蔡楚生的一本最大也最華貴；王人美的一本也差不多；黎莉莉的一本不大不小恰好放在口袋裏；孫瑜的一本却非常樸素而代價亦最廉，因爲他素抱樸質主義雖然幾塊錢買一本簽名册在他是毫無問題，但他總以爲只要動機誠懇正不必講究紙張的美質和裝訂的考究。幾册之中，王人美和黎莉莉的差不多都寫滿了，孫瑜的因爲是新近纔置的所以没有幾頁是給人寫上。最近，韓蘭根也置有一册了，但他的這一册却是中國舊式的賬薄，雖比孫瑜的還要樸素，不過他雙手托向同人請求簽字時，不知道的眞還要以爲他是催索欠賬呢？</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>「黃金時代」導演卜萬蒼蒼身體之重，異乎尋常，昨天在導演室中跟史東山討論「女人」劇本，卜導演順便向一隻椅子坐下，大槪他太用力一些，竟然豁的一聲，那把椅子一隻脚，就此脫離關係，幸虧老卜機精，連忙跳起，總算没有跌交，然而，導演室中的人，却都大笑起來了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>事情出乎意料，此次中華隊竟爲屈服於猶太隊之下，無數球迷，都不禁大爲頽喪，但在電影界中却歡喜了一個影師。斯何人？卽藝華公司攝影師周克，因周克向有猶太富翁雅號，所以許多人都對他這麽說：「猶太富翁，想不到今年貴國如此利害」！周克聽了，一時面有得色，連云：「我不出塲，否則更可旗開得勝呢」。當時，就引動了極大笑聲。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>眞奇怪，大家見了岳楓，都呼之爲「一木三郎先生」原因那天藝華公司開同人聯歡會，岳楓跟王引表演賣藥水，岳楓飾一個東洋人，而這個東洋人名字呌「一木三郎」，因此岳楓遂有「一木三郎」之外號。同時，岳楓身更矮小，頗切合於「一木三郎」這個綽號，但岳楓却常呌「不敢不敢」，</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>克位克道：「我什麽都不怕，祗要你愛我」。瓊蕙蘭道：「但是你還不知道弗蘭克羅其是什麽人呢。他一回兒就要來了」。她話還没有說完，已經有人在打門了。瓊跑到門邊，將門開了一道縫。羅其問道：「你穿好衣服了没有」？瓊將身體藏在門背後，囁嚅地答道：「没有没有，還没有哩」。羅其滿臉氷霜的說道：「那末那個唱歌的在你房裏做什麽」？他說完了，就拿一隻脚伸進門，將門推開。瓊情急地想保護克拉克，但是克拉克已向羅其走了上來，羅其第一次以暴怒的聲音對着瓊道：「滾出去」！瓊還苦苦哀求着道：「這是我呌他來的，請你不要怪他」。但是羅其將眼睛閉成一條小縫，裏面透出兇光，他一把將瓊的手抓住了，將瓊從旁門裏摔子出去。接着砰的一聲，他將房門關了。</p>
<p>在這生死關頭，克拉克很鎭靜地緊對羅其看着。這是他胆量的一個試騐，就是羅其手伸進袋裏的時候，他還是神色不變。他說：「羅其，我想不到這樣和你相見，我正爲瓊的事情，要和你見見哩」。羅其仍舊表示着不可測的態度，靜待克拉克再說下去。克拉克道：「現在我們旣然見面了，我的話又不知從何說起。我聽見人家說你是很公正的」。克拉克停了一回，知道他以下的話，也許會制他的死命的。他說：「我知道我的愛她，比愛我自己的性命還要厲害。要是我終久不以得到她，那我所遭遇的，亦何妨付之度外。你或者呌人來打死我，或者你自己動手，但是你没有法子禁止我愛她」。這時克拉克的話，已經滔滔不絶地從嘴裏衝了出來：「羅其先生，我自己都不能相信，我是站在這個地方和你說話。我並不是什麽不怕死的人。但是我没有那世界上惟一的東西，那給與我這種胆量，和你相對着從我心裏說出眞情的東西，我就不能活着」。他嚈了一口味沫又說道：「瓊曾經和我說過，你曾帮過她多少忙。她對於你是感激無地，但是你不可以拿感激和愛情混在一起。我這次來到這裏，並不是她呌我來的｜她亦不願意你知道我｜怕你於我有所不利。今天我能够會到你，眞是萬幸，使我能够告訴你我怎樣眞誠的愛她。我願意和她結婚。羅其呀，這全在乎你了，請你决定呌我死，或是呌我活罷了」。</p>
<p>羅其將烟捲放下了，他徐徐地走到克拉克面前。他對克拉克看了一回，慢慢地道：「好的，你好好的看待她好了」。他說完了，拿了帽子和手套就走了。又過了幾個禮拜，全百老滙的歌舞界和派克街的當豪們，大家都知道了這位喀萊夜總會的一位歌舞明星、和一位名歌家的婚禮，而曼哈塘鷄鴨保護會的會長，弗蘭克羅其，亦着了大禮服，戴了高帽，擠在觀禮的一般紳士當中。（未完）</p>

He expressed hope that the people of the entire nation would unite under the Three Principles of the People, be organized in an orderly and solemn manner, and resist the Red bandits, making a final offensive. Chiang resolved to be at the forefront, with the people of the entire nation as his support, to achieve complete success. He also expressed gratitude to the press. Following this, Wang gave a speech, the main point being that he hoped that the declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session would call on all members of the Central and lower-level Party departments and the people of the entire nation to unite sincerely, in order to concentrate national strength, enrich national power, and save the nation from peril. Dai and Shao successively gave speeches. The Panchen also delivered a speech, stating that he had come to Beijing to participate in the Plenary Session and had seen a unity of spirit, which was a manifestation of Chinese unity and a result of the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. He had seen that the government's facilities and the revolutionary spirit of all sectors had spread to all five races, making the Republic of China prosperous and progressive. He expressed hope that everyone would unite for the country and the people, and sincerely wished for the realization of peace. Finally, a representative of the Farmers' Association gave a speech, followed by the passage of two proposals. The meeting concluded with slogans at 11:00 AM. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Military news: Xi Enbo, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division of Sun's army, and Li Dianbao attacked Pingluo but were defeated and captured, surrendering completely. Ningxia also sent a telegram stating that Sun gathered in Sanshenggong, swore an oath, claiming that the Fujian Incident had escalated, the Central Government was shaken, and Nanchang had been occupied by the Communists. He stated that if our army did not take the opportunity to advance into the Northwest, there would be no way out. He appointed Liu Yueting as Chairman of Ningxia, Yang Ganqing as Garrison Commander, Yu Shiming as Chairman of Qinghai, and himself concurrently as Chairman of Gansu. They launched attacks from Dengkou and Ligangpu, but suffered losses and retreated in disarray, surrendering completely and advising the officers and soldiers of the division to submit to the Central Government and escape from misery as soon as possible. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin summoned Ma's representative Bai Jianmin on the 26th to inquire about the situation at the front. He stated that the two regiments of Lu Fengnian's army of Sun stationed in Baotou have decided to remain in their original defense positions and are not allowed to advance westward. Chen Yitang, a member of the National Defense Design Committee, went to Baotou on the 26th, reportedly concerning the Sun-Ma incident. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Sun-Ma conflict, it was reported that Sun's army attacking Pingluo had retreated to Huangquqiao, where Sun was also located. Generally, everyone hopes that Yan will be responsible for resolving the issue. It is reported that Sun's army plans to use all its strength to attack Ligangpu and proceed directly to the provincial capital. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Men Bingyue replaced He in Suiyuan, a telegram arrived in Beiping yesterday reporting that he had met with Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and Yuan Qingzeng several times and decided to persuade Sun's army to stop advancing in order to stabilize the border region. Wang has gone to Taiyuan to report to Yan. It is reported that Sun is currently commanding in Huangquqiao. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Ningxia states that the Sun army that occupied Pingluo has been defeated by Ma Baolin's 2nd Brigade of Ma's army, with over 200 officers and soldiers wounded. Brigade Commander Lu and Regiment Commander Chen were captured, and it appears they are fleeing eastward. A large part of Sun's cavalry has been eliminated, and Ma's army is gathering all its strength to attack Tongji and Tongyi Forts. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Sun Dianying's representative Hu Jiesan arrived in Jinan today from Beiping and stated that this time, our army intended to go to the fertile land to reclaim it, but unfortunately clashed with Ma's troops. Army Commander Sun feels extremely pained that our comrades are fighting among themselves. Because Chairman Han has a deep friendship with Ma and also has good relations with Army Commander Sun, he specially sent me to visit Han, requesting him to find a way to mediate between the two sides and end the war. Our army only seeks land to live and eat, and has no other desires. The reason why we must advance westward this time is because it is extremely cold west of Wuyuan, and there is no housing to live in. Han is scheduled to meet with Hu at noon on the 27th.

<p>Wu Jingheng Presided Over the Oath and Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin was sworn in as Chairman of the National Government for another term at the Central Government at 8:00 AM on the 26th. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, Qin Zhen, the Panchen, as well as various Central Committee members, heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, and representatives of various agencies, totaling over a thousand people, attended. Wu Jingheng presided over the ceremony, performing the ritual, presented the seal on behalf of the Central Government, administered the oath, and delivered a speech. (Speech below) Afterward, Lin gave a reply speech, stating that since he assumed the position of Chairman of the National Government for the past two years, although he had not failed in his duties, he felt ashamed of having made no contributions to national welfare and the people's livelihood. Now that he has been re-elected by the Plenary Session, he should even more follow the teachings of the Premier, be loyal and devoted, implement the intentions of the Central Government, and the speech of the supervising committee member, to promote government affairs and seek the welfare of the nation and the people. The photography ceremony was completed at 8:30 AM. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingheng's speech when Chairman Lin took office as Chairman of the National Government is as follows: Comrades, today is the inauguration ceremony of Comrade Lin's re-election as Chairman of the National Government. Chairman Lin is a model figure of our Party comrades. In the past two years, he has set an example for the masses and has been praised by all. The whole country especially admires Chairman Lin as a populist chairman. This is certainly Chairman Lin's special personal cultivation, but it is also a long-standing custom of our Party, because our Premier's whole life was focused on career and duties, and he did not care about his own fame. He has set an example. When the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established, the country needed a president, and the Premier became president. When he handed the presidency over to others, he began to implement industrial plans and became the Director of Railways. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, both internal and external affairs needed a president, so the Premier became president again. Later, it was decided to launch the Northern Expedition, and the military was very busy, so the Premier became the Generalissimo. Therefore, no matter what the title is, in the Premier's eyes, it does not matter. Since our Party established the National Government in Guangdong, Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang have both held this title. Mr. Tan and Mr. Hu also acted as agents for this title in a short period of time, but when they handed over this responsibility to them, they went to do other things. So-called leaders and so-called fame, everyone does not pay attention to. Mencius said, relying on nobility, relying on virtue, and relying on merit. There is none of this in our Party. Occasionally, a small number of people who have lost battles have embraced the desire to be leaders, even causing chaos and rebellion, or being narrow-minded and wanting to destroy unity. This is the error of a very small number of people. Therefore, comrades of our Party take on the duties of leaders or because of fame or because of responsibility, all in the fulfillment of their obligations. Everyone should pay special respect to those who assume the model leadership, and should also give special trust to those who assume the leadership of various responsibilities. It's just that everyone should pay attention to the national system and its elements, not that they personally pay attention to this. Chairman Lin is undertaking this model work, and we believe that he is particularly suitable. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Background of the Independence of Southern Xinjiang British <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the independence of Southern Xinjiang. According to a TASS Moscow telegram: "A message from Tashkent. The largest center in Southern Xinjiang, Kashgar, has established a new government with the support of the Hetian Hui chieftain. The new government is headed by members of the chieftain's staff, a merchant named Sabit Damulla. He declared independence from China, claiming to control the entire southwestern Xinjiang region. At the same time, he sent a delegation to Kabul, Afghanistan, to negotiate mutual recognition. The delegation also plans to visit India." Now, according to the same agency's Paris telegram, "Le Temps reports that Dubaska-Gavin stated, regarding the establishment of a new Islamic government in Kashgar, 'Britain has a serious stance in supporting this anti-Han, anti-Bolshevik government near Tibet.'" The truth of the matter is still unknown, and no further news has arrived to prove it. If the two-day report of TASS is accurate, then the background of this matter is already apparent. The world's capitalist countries have long been vying for supremacy in the Far East, attempting to divide colonies and markets. This news is sufficient to prove the rapid development of the great powers' conspiracy and make us feel alarmed by the approaching crisis on the border and the increasing proximity of the outbreak of a great war. First, we must recognize the seriousness of this independence in Southern Xinjiang. Xinjiang is located in the northwest of our country, with a region of five million square miles and a population of about three million. It has long been a place of contention for foreign forces. The Qing Dynasty once made great efforts to develop it, but since the Republic of China, it has gradually become estranged from China. However, its economic relations with the Soviet Union, India, Afghanistan, and Persia have become increasingly close. The so-called new government is located in Kashgar, which is located at 75 degrees east longitude and 39 degrees north latitude. It was opened as a trading port in the seventh year of Guangxu's reign. It has a population of about 100,000, twice that of Ürümqi, the capital of Xinjiang. It is rich in wool, raw cotton, and metals. Economically and militarily, it is the center of southern Xinjiang. As for Hotan, it is a large agricultural area in the south with a population of about 200,000. It has always been a center for Hui activities. Now that the Hotan chieftain has prompted his subordinates to establish an independent government in Shule, it can be used to disrupt Qinghai and Gansu. The impact will be more than just the shock of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Second, we cannot help but suspect that someone is manipulating behind the scenes when we study the reasons for Shule's independence. Since the British occupied India and ruled Afghanistan, actively seeking to expand our country's west has been a consistent policy for decades. The independence of Bhutan and Nepal in the past, and the cession of Zhimengxiong and Ladakh (event in the 16th year of Guangxu) were all expressions of its active expansion. This independence, such as recruiting anti-Kimaar elements who have fled to India and Japan, and conducting negotiations with Afghanistan and India for mutual recognition, and the leader of the new government being a merchant, the power behind it is already obvious. Dubaska-Gavin said that Britain has a serious stance in helping this, which does not seem to be aimless.</p>
<p>Third. We also know that this sudden move in Shule is a reflection of the Japanese military's active completion of its continental policy. Since Japan has been rapidly invading our Northeast and Inner Mongolia, its ambitions have not yet been satisfied. The British have always regarded our country's west as their possessions. Now seeing the Japanese deployment, they are taking the lead. They have no choice but to form an alliance with the Netherlands to establish a secret naval agreement. At the same time, they are rushing to complete the naval base in Singapore. On the one hand, they are also promoting the independence of the Hui people in our southern Xinjiang to prevent their power from being infringed upon. The purpose is already conceivable.</p>
<p>From the above, the independence of Shule seems simple, but it actually has the form of a two-pronged attack on our territory by imperialist powers. Once the balance of power in the Far East is broken, will the situation in the southwest not be dangerous?</p>
<p>However. Our argument is only based on TASS news, which is also Soviet news. The Soviet Union has a close relationship with Xinjiang. Of course, it is no less important than the British. Therefore, whether its news is reliable is waiting for future reports from other parties to prove it.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Concerning the Unverified News of Independence in Southern Xinjiang <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Gong Bicheng Discusses the Situation in Xinjiang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign dispatches, the Hui people of Kashi, southern Xinjiang, have formed a new government led by merchant Sabit Damulla, declaring southern Xinjiang as their territory, expelling the Han people, and appointing Damulla as the chief representative to lead a delegation to Afghanistan, India, and other places to negotiate friendly treaties. According to Gong Bicheng, an official from the Xinjiang Provincial Government stationed in Beijing, Xinjiang is situated between British and Russian spheres of influence. Britain has already constructed a railway from Amritsar in India to Kashmir, and further branched out into two routes from Kashmir. The former extends north to Peshawar, and the latter east to Hengsha, both near the Xinjiang border, in order to connect with the southwestern parts of Xinjiang, such as Shule and Shufu. In Tibet, railways are being built from the Indian capital to Sikkim and Pali to enter Tibet, connecting with southern Xinjiang and Hotan areas. Since Soviet Russia has constructed railways in Central Asia, it has encircled the entire northwestern and western borders of Xinjiang, forming an arc-shaped railway. The southern end, Tashkent, is very close to Shule, so Russia has very good access to information. Perhaps Russia deliberately released this startling news to attract world attention to prevent British invasion. We certainly hope this news is inaccurate. After Japan's invasion of the Northeast, it has been actively engaged in Eastern Mongolia, seeking to develop in the Northwest. Recently, a member was sent to Xinjiang, the intention is quite clear. Looking at past events, taking in Muslim aristocrat Gurban Ali in Tokyo and recruiting the deposed Turkish prince as if he were a rare commodity, and organizing the Alitai Red Cross Society and the Black Wolf Society, at that time Turkey had no ambition, but because of national and religious ties, it often interacted with the Hui people, and the Hui people were happy to use the Turkish opposition to Kemal to gather exiles and go to Kashi to train troops. Therefore, the situation in southern Xinjiang is extremely complicated. Due to inconvenient transportation, the central government is unable to oversee the affairs there and is inevitably uninformed about the situation. Last autumn, the British government recalled its consul stationed in Kashi and appointed a new consul to secretly investigate. If the news of independence is indeed confirmed, then the British side seems unable to absolve itself of responsibility. However, Sabit Damulla is not a former subordinate of the Hui chieftains, nor is he particularly fierce. Most of the Hui people are very moderate and usually very obedient to the central government. As long as the central government communicates with them, there would definitely be no discovery of a new government. Besides urgently telegramming the Xinjiang provincial government and friends at the British consulate in Kashi for inquiries, I visited Chairman Chiang and President Wang on the 5th to report everything and make requests. I have just heard that our ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, upon hearing the telegram of independence in southern Xinjiang, immediately</p>
<p>telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The representatives from Inner Mongolia who came to Beijing believe that the autonomy proposals do not meet the initially agreed principles and have repeatedly petitioned the Fourth Plenary Session, requesting that the matter be reviewed by the Central Political Council. According to Su Rudai, a representative from the Ulanqab League, the representatives from Inner Mongolia, whose legitimate demands have not been met, originally planned to pack their bags and return to Mongolia immediately. However, after repeated persuasion and retention by Secretary-General Ye of the Central Government, President Zhu of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Shi of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, who promised to seek remedies, all the representatives have been telegraphing to the league princes reporting the developments. Recent replies also indicate that they firmly cannot accept the proposals. Now, after consultation, the representatives have decided to stay in Beijing for another ten days to hear the final policy of the central government. On the 26th, they visited the Panchen Lama to present the details and request his strong support. The day before, they inquired with members of the Military Affairs Commission about the date of the meeting with Chairman Chiang, who promised to notify them within two or three days.

<p>(Nanjing) The Inner Mongolian representatives originally planned to return to Mongolia immediately.

<p>The Key to World Peace or War</p>
<h3 id="e25">European Countries Are Scheming and Secretly Forming Groups <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Secret Negotiations Are Underway in Capitals of Various Countries</p>
<p>Seeking to Restore the International Balance of Power Before the European War</p>
<p>America's Non-Interference in European Affairs Has Promoted This</p>
<p>France and Germany Each Establish Their Own Factions, Forming Opposition</p>
<p>(London) According to recent news, the secret alliances among European countries are a key to world peace. Secret diplomatic negotiations are currently underway in London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Rome, and other places, hoping to create a balance of power. This action is a major reason why American representative Davis announced his non-interference in European affairs after leaving Europe and returning to the United States. Amidst the discussions of disarmament conferences and the reorganization of the League of Nations, the European situation has divided into two factions. One is the connection between Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary, with Britain maintaining a semi-neutral position. The other faction is the combination of France, Russia, Poland, Turkey, and other small countries such as Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The small European countries may soon recognize the Soviet Russian government. French Foreign Minister Pengu is traveling to various countries in Eastern Europe and may also go to Russia for contact. As for the background of the development of European countries, there are three main points: (1) German Chancellor Hitler has declared to France that Germany is unwilling to abide by the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, with a force of 100,000 troops, and the British proposal of 200,000 troops. Germany must have a force of 300,000 troops and 700 military pursuit aircraft, and the Saar region should also be returned to Germany immediately. (2) France has expressed opposition to this proposal. However, if Germany firmly opposes the disarmament conference, France may recognize Germany's demands if it can get help from Britain. (3) British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke with the French ambassador, Tarai, this afternoon, and Tarai is about to return to Paris to report on Britain's attitude. Recently, Britain has been paying close attention to the actions between the Balkan countries, as the Balkan countries are currently engaging in friendly contacts and negotiating non-aggression treaties.

<p>Will Decide After Austria Formally Appeals to the League of Nations</p>
<p>France Fully Expects Britain to Intervene in Germany</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon had a long talk with Prime Minister MacDonald this afternoon. The revision of the British disarmament plan and the Austrian issue seemed to be the main topics of discussion. Regarding the latter, if Germany gives a negative answer to Austria's request (the Austrian ambassador to Germany formally requested the German Foreign Minister to issue a declaration formally recognizing and respecting Austria's independence, otherwise it will seek direct recourse to the League of Nations), and Austria formally submits a reasoned request to the League of Nations, the British government must wait until Austria officially makes a request before it can decide on its attitude. How its attitude will be will also depend on the request made by Austria. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British cabinet expressed its opinion that the major countries related to the German-Austrian issue should persuade Berlin not to engage in activities in Austria before Austria seeks recourse to the League of Nations. Political circles here have criticized this opinion of the British cabinet, saying that British cabinet members intend to allow a general disarmament convention to be established, but this cannot be achieved without Germany. Therefore, they want to reunite with Germany and thus want to find a disarmament convention that can reconcile Germany's desire to rearm and France's security concerns. However, Germany's attitude has been firm so far, and it is impossible to reconcile in this way. British cabinet members are careful everywhere to take care of Germany so as not to hurt its feelings. The reason for advocating that countries should persuade Germany before Austria seeks recourse to the League of Nations is to please Germany. The French political circles not only have no reservations about the British cabinet's opinion, but also express their satisfaction with its initiative. If the new British disarmament plan can bring the disarmament convention to a successful conclusion, and if the negotiations with Germany can stop the Hitler Party's activities in Austria, France will be the first to express its happiness. Therefore, people here are paying close attention to the British cabinet's suggestion. However, one thing must be clarified, that is, as of now, London and</p>

<p>(Berlin) Because British newspapers have recently reported that the British government is considering jointly protesting to the Berlin government with France and Italy against interfering in the German-Austrian issue, the "Ordinary Newspaper" published an article today stating that if the British government really has such a proposal, it shows that the British side has not yet understood the cause of the dispute between Germany and Austria, and does not know that the internal difficulties in Austria are the biggest component of this problem. The Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss cannot solve his own difficulties, so he wants to use foreign governments and the League of Nations to maintain his regime. This is a bad example of using foreign forces to suppress the people of the country. Therefore, countries should think twice before being used by Austria to interfere in the internal strife between German ethnic groups. It must be known that the only fact is that Dollfuss only has the support of a very small minority of people, so he does not dare to allow the people to openly express their opinions in elections, and the principle of national self-determination has been completely destroyed.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia Political figures in the capital of Yugoslavia claimed that rumors of the imminent signing of a non-aggression pact between the four Balkan countries (Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece), and explanations of the content of the pact, are premature. It was also said that this pact currently only includes four countries, but it is still hoped that other countries in the Balkan Peninsula, especially Bulgaria, will join. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome The "Italian Daily" published a semi-official document</p>
<p>explaining Italy's attitude towards the future Balkan Four-Nation Non-Aggression Treaty. According to this document, Italy does not oppose it in principle, but Italy cannot express its opinion until its content is clear. The document also stated that there are still many opinions and suggestions, and the conclusion of the treaty is still far away. Even the general outline is not yet ready. Many aspects speculate on the attitude of the major powers towards this matter, but the question is difficult to answer at present. As for Italy, although some people say that the Greek Foreign Minister Maximos's recent visit to Rome made the Italian government approve the treaty, in reality Maximos did not ask Italy to recognize it, but only explained the nature of the treaty to the Italian Prime Minister. In short, Italy has never recognized this treaty because Italy does not yet know its true content. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Washington) American naval officials have requested the government to establish the largest navy. Today, an official spoke out, criticizing Britain and Japan for their propaganda in the United States against armament. The American navy also addressed Rear Admiral Hood Washington's speech at the Washington Women's Patriotic Association meeting, condemning Britain and Japan for trying to create anti-armament propaganda to influence the minds of the American people. He said this propaganda can be seen almost daily in the newspapers. Hood also said that the American government should quickly decide on a national defense policy, otherwise it will suffer greatly from not making preparations. I am not a scaremonger, but I pay close attention to the facts. Hood also advised all American women not to be misled by this propaganda. Speaking after Hood was the American Military Affairs Deputy Secretary Hoderlin, who created the idea that the American government should manufacture huge warships so that the American government can cope with the crisis when war breaks out. According to Hoderlin, the world situation has gone deep into a dangerous line, and the United States needs to expand its navy more urgently than any other country. He also said that he sincerely hopes that the two meetings can quickly implement the plans that have been proposed. (National Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun met with a reporter from the Dutch Amsterdam Electricity News Agency and expressed grave concern about the tension between Russia and Japan, which may lead to war. German newspapers reprinted this interview, which shows that the Germans are paying attention to the situation in the Far East. The German military and political circles are particularly concerned about this, because the possibility of a Russian-Japanese war is very relevant to Germany, as it can divert Soviet Russia's attention to Europe. Recently, there have been many so-called cultural contacts between Japan and Germany. Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations and the strong nature of its policies are quite in line with the National Socialist Party. Dr. Gu said in the interview that China's attitude towards the Manchurian problem has always remained unchanged. The Dutch newspaper reporter asked whether there was a rumor that Germany would recognize "Manchukuo" and exchange it for certain concessions, such as returning the former German territory currently under Japanese trusteeship to Germany. Dr. Gu replied that he hoped this would not happen, as it would harm Sino-German relations. It would be unfortunate if the cooling of German-Russian relations led Germany to seek closer relations between Germany and Japan, because German goods are sold very widely in China.

<p>New Zealand Authorities Highly Value the Dumping of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Cotton Industry Negotiations Underway in Lancashire</p>
<p>(Lyon) The local Chamber of Commerce held its first discussion on Japanese business competition and passed a resolution hoping that: (1) an international convention be established to unify the production conditions of all countries without exceptions, and that any country not participating should be subject to a ban on imports from that country by all other signatory nations; (2) before the signing of an international convention, France should limit the quantity of Japanese goods that compete with French products, and the method of limitation should be compatible with Japan's export needs. However, one aspect must be noted: during the European War, all of France's resources were used to defend the country and there was no time for other concerns. Japan seized the opportunity to expand its industrial equipment, and as a result, French commercial markets are now being seized by Japanese goods; (3) the French government should take all kinds of measures to maintain the sales of French goods in colonies and mandated territories. Japanese merchants are increasingly selling goods in French mandated territories without buying return goods; (4) as for Japanese goods that have not yet had quantities limited, and the goods referred to in items two and three, opinions should be solicited from various chambers of commerce in France, and as soon as opinions are collected, the government should take necessary protective measures to maintain the survival of French industry and export trade. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Panwell, New Zealand's representative in London, told Reuters reporters today that the Japanese threat to New Zealand's commerce is a serious issue. Japan is currently dumping large quantities of goods into New Zealand, and even with high tariffs, it is difficult to compete with its low prices. Therefore, the local government and the British government</p>
<p>are paying close attention to this matter. (Reuters News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Minister of Commerce Runciman stayed in Manchester for two days and heard many reproaches, mostly pointing out that the British government had not given sufficient assistance to the Lancashire cotton industry, and had not resisted Japanese competition. However, those in Lancashire who are calm know that the government cannot deal with the overseas Japanese competition in every way, because the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty would inevitably lead to a fierce trade war between the two countries, and hinder the friendly relations between the two countries. Privately, it is recognized that the Lancashire cotton industry has room for self-help. Indeed, the internal structure of the British cotton industry urgently needs to be reorganized, and old factories that over-invested during the cotton industry boom of 1921 also need to be reorganized. At the same time, the unfair attitude of the French government towards Britain also makes British people very indignant. Britain is France's best customer, but the French import quota for the United States has been restored to its original state due to Washington's negotiations. The original text of the newly established Russo-French commercial treaty, which was published yesterday, also allows Russia to enjoy a quota far exceeding its export volume to France last year. France is only haggling with Britain, and refuses to restore the original quota. French officials admit that they are currently trying to find tools to conduct negotiations on a new Anglo-French commercial treaty, but everyone believes that Britain will never be willing to conduct this negotiation unless the quota reduced by France is fully restored. The British business community now holds a kind of feeling that the principle of treaty-making urgently needs to be revised, and the most-favored-nation clause should be restricted. Although Runciman is doing his best to appease Lancashire's demands, the British Chamber of Commerce has written a letter advocating the adoption of a three-tier tariff system, imposing particularly harsh tariffs on countries that cannot treat Britain fairly. (Reuters News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Manchester Minister of Commerce Runciman gave a speech to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce today, mentioning the necessity of dealing with foreign competition, saying that industrialists can rely on the government's continuous assistance in all aspects. Britain's major industries must use the best brains and adopt the most thorough methods of production and distribution, and young talents in universities should engage in commerce instead of doing jobs that are purely parasitic. We oppose foreign political or other forces that may make our competitive efforts come to naught. He knew that the Indo-Japanese cotton spinning agreement was not what Lancashire wanted, but this solution is better than nothing. If the British representatives cannot obtain reasonable conditions from the Japanese side in this Anglo-Japanese negotiation, the British government should help. The Japanese Cotton Industry Committee in Britain has now received long-awaited instructions, instructing them to immediately start negotiations with Lancashire. The Japanese representatives will now contact Lancashire cotton counterparts to discuss the agenda together. (Reuters News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Manchester Minister of Commerce Runciman stated today that the Japanese Embassy has stated that there are now various reasons to believe that after the Japanese cotton industry groups obtain the consent of the delegation, the position of Okada and other Japanese representatives can be perfectly defined, and this matter will be discussed when the meeting is held in a few days. Runciman does not agree with artificially encouraging industry, saying that if American methods are applied to the British cotton industry, the result will lead to destruction.</p>
<p>But the British government does not mean that it does not want to provide the cotton industry with the convenience of government organizations. If the British representatives cannot obtain considerable conditions with Japan, then the British government may come forward to help. What we seek is nothing more than a fair method in the world market. The cotton industry can rely on the government's support, we know the importance of time, and we do not want to listen to its delay. (Reuters News Agency, 25th)</p>

However, the timing and methods of implementation have not yet been decided. Also, whether the degree of reduction will be based on the US dollar or the British pound</p>
<p>is also under consideration. In short, in the future, when it is necessary to implement the reduction of the yen value in response to the world trend, the government will explain its contents in detail. (Japanese United News Agency, 26th)</p>

The details are as follows: Mr. Nakano asked, Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi said that the extraordinary situation is gradually being resolved, and are pleased with the increase in bank deposits and the exchange amount of the clearinghouse. However, this is an increase in accumulation, not an increase in purchasing power, and does not involve the problem of livelihood or unemployment. How can the economy recover? The recent economy is only a temporary reaction of injecting camphor. Once the orders for military demand expansion are interrupted, there will be a major backlash. Various countries and their economic groups will strive to prevent the export of Japan's important industrial products. Now, not only diplomatic issues, but also the economy is in an extraordinary time. How does the Saito Cabinet recognize this extraordinary time? Does Army Minister Hayashi also recognize, like former Army Minister Araki, that the primary meaning of national defense lies in the stability of the people's lives behind the gun and domestic transformation?</p>

<p>Recently, various countries have repeatedly carried out anti-Japanese propaganda, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude towards this is hesitant. Does Foreign Minister Hirota have the determination to deal with the big shots of various countries in a proper and upright manner? The foundation of international peace lies in justice, and the basis of justice lies in fairness. Based on this belief, does Navy Minister Osumi and Foreign Minister Hirota have the determination to demand equality of armaments at the next disarmament conference? Does it have the determination to declare the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia to the United Kingdom and the United States? To make Soviet Russia recognize Manchuria, solve the Eastern Railway problem, and conclude a non-aggression treaty, first consolidate the foundation, and then deal with the powers, which is the key to diplomacy. Does Foreign Minister Hirota have this enthusiasm? The principle of public bonds often produces extraordinary profiteers and extraordinary victims, which has intensified unemployment and reduced the people's livelihood. Does the government intend to set up an agency to implement genuine investment? Does it intend to reform the current tax system? Can a special tax be set up in extraordinary times and a low-interest exchange of public bonds be carried out? I am now questioning the crisis awareness of the cabinet members. Prime Minister Saito replied that the government is not only singing optimistic arguments, and the cabinet members are working together to try to open up the situation.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied that when he heard Mr. Nakano's speech, his blood was surging, and what he believed was completely the same. The so-called Monroe Doctrine of the Far East, etc., if used in a foreign language, there is a risk of misunderstanding Japan's true intentions as a foreign style, and it will be expressed by the phrase "Japan's special position." Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima replied that he intends to complete industrial control. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto replied that the facts cited by Mr. Nakano regarding the problem of rural regeneration are completely different. The countryside is generally following the path of gradual regeneration. Army Minister Hayashi replied that most of the soldiers of the army are children of the countryside, so the military pays great attention to rural regeneration. Minister of Finance Takahashi replied that he greatly admired Mr. Nakano's enthusiasm. Finally, Nakano stood up from his seat and said that although the Prime Minister's painstaking efforts were understandable, what he did was extremely unsatisfactory. The questioning ended.

<p>Responsibility for Tense Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>Cannot Be Resolved by Flowery Words</p>
<p>Russia's Peaceful Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the speech of the Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Koki that this speech might have some good influence in improving Japan's international relations, but it cannot be said to have achieved this goal. The formula Hirota used is to attach importance to Japan's national mission in Asia. At the beginning, he stated the perfection of Japan's international relations, and at the end, he said, "Japan's current and future diplomatic relations do have a number of serious problems. Only a prosperous country has a thorny road ahead." On the other hand, Hirota made a statement to the Soviet Union. He wanted to explain that the tension in Japanese-Soviet relations was caused by the change in the Soviet Union's position. Hirota obviously wanted to rely on this statement to reduce the responsibility of the Japanese government for making the situation in the Far East tense. This responsibility should be fully borne by the Japanese government. How can Hirota absolve himself and the Japanese government of responsibility with a few words? As for the Soviet Union, it has proposed the conclusion of a non-aggression pact, agreed to the organization of the Soviet-Japanese-Manchurian border committee, and is willing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, which has shown its intention to consolidate peace in the Far East without reservation. The Soviet government's peaceful policy has never changed, and at the same time, if Japan does not finally implement its aggressive plan against the Soviet Union, this policy will not change in the future. It is regrettable that the elements within Japan who support military adventures and plunder are actively pursuing their plan to prepare for this aggression. Unfortunately, Hirota's speech and Hayashi's succession to Araki as Minister of the Army have not shown that the Japanese government has decided not only to eliminate the tense relations between it and the Soviet Union with flowery words, but with concrete facts. This kind of relationship is actually produced by the policy of the Japanese military. (Tass News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chengdu, 24th telegram, Gu Zhizhong, head of the Sichuan-Kang investigation group, met with Tang, Chief of Staff of the 29th Army, on the afternoon of the 23rd and talked about the suppression of bandits in detail. According to Tang, at the end of the year before last, Xu Fei, Xiang Qian, and others led a pseudo-Fourth Front Army of about 10,000 people and fled from Shaanxi to Sichuan. Taking advantage of the emptiness of the defenses when the Sichuan war was not yet over, they occupied the three counties of Tongnanba. Tian Songyao, the commander of this army, led his troops to block and suppress them last spring, fought alone, and recovered all the lost land, and was on the verge of extermination. However, due to the sole suppression by one army, it was not easy to encircle, and the economy relied solely on the burdens of the counties in the army's garrison area, and it felt exhausted. When the Sichuan war broke out again, the flames of the bandits took the opportunity to reignite. Tongnanba fell back into the hands of the bandits. Although this army still tried its best to resist and support for ten months, the other armies had no time to take care of it, and the support troops were not dispatched for a while, causing the bandit disaster to spread. Yiyingdaxuan fell one after another. Fortunately, in October, the armies divided up and encircled the bandits, and won victories one after another.

<h3 id="e51">Kailuan Labor Strike Expands <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Workers in Four Mines Strike in Succession</p>
<p>Declare Will Not Stop Until Goal is Achieved</p>
<p>Mine Owner Declares No Responsibility</p>
<p>British Consulate Asks Authorities to Stop Quickly</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 25th, workers in Tangjiazhuang, Kailuan, and on the 26th, workers in Linxi and Tangshan mines went on strike to support the workers in Majiagou mine, demanding five conditions from the mine owner: 1. Restore the labor union; 2. Dissolve the mine area security team and punish the perpetrators; 3. All unemployed workers will be reinstated; 4. Provide compensation to the deceased workers; 5. Abolish the contract system. Workers in the three mines declared that they would never return to work until the goal is achieved. Today, the person in charge of the Kailuan Mining Bureau said that of the five mines, only Zhaogezhuang mine is still working. Since the strike on the 21st, the mining side has suffered too much loss. The mining side has made up its mind to endure the pain and seek a quick end to the strike, and the workers return to the mine to work, but it has not worked. This strike is definitely not a labor-capital dispute as rumored, because since the workers went on strike, no one has come to the mine to demand an increase in any treatment. As for the workers' request to restore the labor union, it is not the responsibility of the mining side. (Special telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the Kailuan coal mine turmoil, the conditions between labor and capital have not been agreed upon, and the workers are still continuing their strike. This afternoon, British Consul-General in Tianjin, Zhai Lansi, and Nason Edward, Kailuan Mining Director, went to the Provincial Government to meet and ask to severely punish the instigators of the strike and force the workers to resume work. Yu did not agree, saying that he had ordered the real hall to send staff to the mine to adopt peaceful methods and advise the workers not to insist on the labor union organization and resume work first. (Special telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan coal mine strike turmoil has been expanding since the 14th. There are a total of five mines in Kailuan, namely (1) Majiagou (2) Zhaogezhuang, (3) Linxi, (4) Tangjiazhuang, (5) Tangshan. The first to launch this strike was Majiagou. The two sides have been deadlocked for more than ten days. Unexpectedly, the workers in the Linxi mine area suddenly continued their strike on the 25th. On the same night, the workers in Tangjiazhuang also went on strike one after another. On the morning of the 26th, Zhaogezhuang also showed signs of strike. The workers in the Tangshan mine area also stated that if there is no practical solution within three days, all the workers will act in unison. It is heard that the point of contention in this strike is to restore the labor union. According to the Bureau, this kind of authority is not within the Bureau, because the Tanggu Agreement restricts the activities of labor unions within the war zone, so the Bureau is unable to be responsible for the strike. The British Consul and the manager of the mine visited Chairman Yu at 6 pm on the 26th, asking him to pay attention and ask for a quick solution. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Course of the Central Army's Recovery of Zhangzhou <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Third Division Lands in Song and Advances on Zhang</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Retreats Without a Fight</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xiamen states that Cai Tingkai left the province on the 15th and flew to Zhangzhou to command the 60th Division of Shen Guanghan, the 78th Division of Qu Shounian, the 49th Division of Zhang Yan, and other units totaling more than 20,000 troops, who retreated south from Fuzhou. They were deployed between Xianyou and Putian. The Central Army, with ten divisions (a total of twelve divisions of the Central Army entering Fujian, plus about two divisions of the Zhejiang Security Force and special forces, for a total strength of fourteen divisions), advanced south in two routes. The Fourth and Tenth Divisions crossed the river at Shuikou on the 17th and advanced towards Xianyou via Yongtai. The Thirty-sixth and Ninth Divisions crossed the river at Xiadou in the provincial capital on the morning of the 18th and advanced towards Putian via Fuqing, advancing very rapidly. It was hoped that they would strike the retreating troops of the 19th Route Army before their defenses were established. The Fourth and Tenth Divisions reached Xianyou on the 19th, and the Ninth and Thirty-sixth Divisions reached Putian on the 20th. The 19th Route Army had not originally planned to retreat to southern Fujian, so there were no preparations made in advance between Putian and Xianyou. At this time, the ranks were in disarray, and the Central Army pursued closely until the area between Putian and Xianyou, and the Shaxi Yiban area between Huian and Fengting, where the 19th Route Army began to establish defenses based on the natural terrain and counterattack. The troops of the four divisions of the Central Army on both routes converged and attacked from three sides. Fierce fighting began on the 20th. Cai Tingkai commanded at the front, and the troops collapsed again on the morning of the 21st. In this battle, the Central Army captured more than 6,000 rifles, hundreds of light and heavy machine guns, dozens of various artillery pieces, and more than 20 vehicles, and captured more than 6,000 prisoners. The defeated soldiers abandoned their weapons along the way, and the Huian militia and villagers picked up no less than several thousand more. The Thirty-sixth Division took advantage of the victory to pursue and occupied Huian County on the afternoon of the 21st. The vanguard reached Luoyang Bridge that evening. On the 22nd, most of the troops continued to arrive, but because Shen Guanghan and others telegraphed from Quanzhou to declare their allegiance, they were ordered to temporarily stop the pursuit. Currently, the Thirty-sixth and Ninth Divisions are temporarily stationed in the southern part of Luoyang. This is the battle situation of the Central Army's southward pursuit of the Putian-Xianyou area.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the defeat of the 19th Route Army after its retreat to the south was that Zhangzhou was attacked by the Central Army's Third Division, which landed in Songyu by sea from Xiamen on the morning of the 20th. The loss of Zhangzhou meant that the rear was completely cut off, and they were trapped in a pincer attack from both Putian-Xianyou and Zhangzhou, with no way to retreat. Cai Tingkai planned to cede the defense of Zhangzhou and Longyan to the Guangdong Army in order to secure his rear, while using the remaining 40,000 troops to defend Quanzhou and Zhangzhou to the death. However, when the war in northern Fujian began, most of the troops in southern Fujian were transferred to the province, leaving only the 49th Division's Zhou Lixing regiment of Zhang Yan's department, as well as two artillery battalions and six to seven hundred students from the military academy in Zhangzhou. As a result, when the Central Army's Third Division landed in Songyu and advanced on Zhangzhou, Xu Minghong, who was in Zhangzhou, knew that it could not be defended and ordered the abandonment of Zhangzhou and retreat on the afternoon of the 20th. By the morning of the 21st, they had retreated completely towards Longyan. When Shen Mao and others in Quanzhou learned that Zhangzhou had been lost, they issued a telegram on the afternoon of the 21st declaring their allegiance.</p>
<p>The Central Army that recovered Zhangzhou and Tong'an was the Eighth and Ninth Brigades of the Third Division and the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Supplemental Regiments of the Fourth Column of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army, commanded by Division Commander Li Yutang and Deputy Division Commander Yang Tingya. On the 19th, they sailed from the province via Taishun, Xinning, Xing, Hai'an, Xinming, Yunlong, Fengpu, and Liulun, and arrived in Xiamen on the morning of the 20th, landing in Songyu. The several dozen members of the Fujian Western Volunteer Corps stationed in Songyu retreated along the Zhangzhou-Songyu highway towards Zhangzhou upon seeing the arrival of the large army. The Supplemental Regiment of the Third Division, led by Bian Ling, pursued, and the Volunteer Corps retreated while fighting. After Xiamen was recovered, the transportation between Zhangzhou and Xiamen was cut off. Xu Minghong, the puppet governor of Longyan Province, and Yu Huamu, the garrison commander of Zhangzhou, Longyan, and Xiamen, in order to maintain the morale of the people in Zhangzhou, confiscated and burned all Xiamen newspapers transported to Zhangzhou, even those sent by mail. The peasant association between Zhangzhou and Xiamen was very active, and they often shot those they identified as local tyrants. On the 15th, Xu Minghong also published a small one-page public newspaper, carrying news from their side. On the morning of the 20th, Xu Minghong received news that the Central Army had landed in Songyu and decided to abandon Zhangzhou and retreat to Longyan. On one hand, he sent a team to the Longxi Chamber of Commerce to demand 30,000 yuan, surrounding the chamber of commerce as if facing a formidable enemy, and finally took away 15,000 yuan. In Zhao'an, Zhang Shiyu, commander of the Fourth Detachment of Yang Fengnian's Southern Fujian Anti-Rebel Army, led Shen Donghai in capturing Zhao'an, Dongshan, and Yunxiao, and then attacked Zhangpu. At the same time, the militia between Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Haicheng rose up. In addition to dispatching a battalion of Zhou's regiment to defend Zhangpu, Xu Minghong also deployed more than 1,600 volunteer troops reorganized from the Communist Red Guards to defend the Zhangzhou, Xiamen, and Haicheng area to maintain local order. Later, with the loss of Zhangzhou, they also collapsed and retreated. Before the 19th Route Army abandoned Zhangzhou, they first ordered all troops and personnel of various agencies in the city to retreat by 5:00 a.m. on the 21st. However, the matter happened suddenly, just like the unprepared abandonment of Fuzhou. As a result, all guns, ammunition, and military rice were difficult to transport together. In addition, most of the vehicles in Zhangzhou were driven to northern Fujian, and many are still in the Putian-Xianyou area, so there were no vehicles available for transport. At 2:40 a.m. on the 21st, the gunpowder depot next to the West Gate County Government, Madudi, the Li Ancestral Hall, the arsenal, and the ordnance depot of the 49th Division in Dagouqian, the ordnance depot of the 60th Division at the mouth of the County Government, and the ordnance and baggage depot of the Zhishan Barracks were burned at the same time. For a time, the sound of explosions and gunfire was deafening throughout the city. At the Zhangpu station, the troops sealed the cars because no one answered the door when they knocked, and they were also burned. At dawn, the residents learned that the troops had retreated and rushed out to loot the military equipment, ammunition, and tools from the military and political agencies. The whole city was in a state of anarchy. Several people were shot dead during the competition for weapons and ammunition. The 19th Route Army retreated towards Nanjing. Those who retreated included 600 to 700 students from the Zhishan Military Officer Training Class, more than 1,500 infantrymen from the Zhou Lixing regiment of the 49th Division, one artillery battalion of the Fourth Army, one artillery battalion of the Third Division, more than 100 members of the County Government Security Team, Xu Minghong's political security division, and staff members of the rear office, the Peasants' Liberation Association, the General Labor Union, and special commissioners from various districts, totaling about 4,000 people. After arriving in Nanjing, they retreated to the depths. At about 10:00, Chen Linrong, commander of the Sixth Detachment of the Anti-Rebel Army, and Zhang Longqing, commander of the Fourth Regiment, each led a large team of about 300 to 400 people into the city. After entering the city, Zhang found hidden weapons of the 19th Route Army in a civilian house on Zhishan Kou Main Street, including more than 2,000 newly manufactured 1933 American rapid-fire rifles, 13 anti-aircraft machine guns, and other military supplies, which were all carried away by Zhang's troops.</p>
<p>In addition, the military equipment and ammunition of the 19th Route Army stored in Nanxiang were also carried away by Zhang Feiji, a member of the militia. Therefore, the failure of the 19th Route Army this time was due to the lack of combat preparedness. The number of guns lost below Yanping and recovered by the militia is unknown. This is a major problem for the post-war settlement in Fujian. At about 1:00 p.m. on the 21st, the Central Army arrived in Zhangzhou and dropped a bomb in Madudi that did not explode. The Chamber of Commerce urgently notified the whole city to hang the Blue Sky White Sun flag. At 5:00 a.m. on the 22nd, all the supplemental regiments of the Central Army's Third Division, led by Regiment Commander Fan Ling, arrived in Zhangzhou, thus completely recovering Zhangzhou. Division Commander Li Yutang arrived in Zhangzhou at 1:00 p.m. on the 22nd. Part of the Ninth Brigade continued to enter Zhangzhou in the afternoon, totaling about 3,000 people. In addition, on the 21st, the province continued to transport the 17th and 18th Regiments of the Third Division to Xiamen for landing. In addition to the two regiments heading to Zhangzhou, the remaining Eighth and Ninth Brigade Headquarters and the four regiments of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Regiments all transferred to Tong'an via Jiaowei.</p>
<p>In Tong'an, there was originally only one battalion of Yun's regiment of the 19th Route Army stationed. In addition, there was Chen Wenzong, the commander of the Zhangzhou-Longyan guerrilla force appointed by the 19th Route Army, who also served as the county magistrate. At noon on the 20th, Yun's battalion was ordered to concentrate and retreat. On the 21st, Chen Wenzong declared his allegiance and was appointed as the commander of the Ninth Detachment of the Anti-Rebel Army by Du Qiyun. At 10:00 p.m. that night, the 15th and 16th Regiments of the Third Division arrived at the county seat from Jiaowei via Guankou. Because the password did not match, they were attacked by the troops, killing two members of Chen's unit and confiscating more than 20 weapons. Chen's unit retreated to outside the city. On the morning of the 22nd, the 17th and 18th Regiments of the Third Division continued to arrive in Tong'an. The vanguard of the Third Division advanced to Maxiang. The Eighth and Ninth Brigade Headquarters, totaling about 10,000 people, were all stationed in Tong'an County. After Li Yutang arrived in Zhangzhou, he returned to Tong'an on the morning of the 23rd to command the troops and contact a certain division of the Central Army advancing towards Xiwei and Anxi. His division headquarters was set up in Zhangzhou.</p>
<p>Jiang Dingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army, arrived in Xiamen on the 21st to preside over the military affairs in southern Fujian. On the 22nd, he established the General Headquarters at the Xiamen Public Security Bureau (the Public Security Bureau moved back to Huanzhu Hall). All the personnel of the General Headquarters arrived in Xiamen on the 23rd and began to work immediately. When Jiang arrived in Xiamen, Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, and Zhang Yan sent out telegrams from Quanzhou declaring their allegiance. After receiving the telegram, Jiang telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions and ordered the various armies to continue their military operations according to the original orders. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Ma Zhanshan Decides to Go Abroad <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>First to the Philippines, then to the Americas</p>
<p>Planning to Study Industries for Half a Year</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Tianjin, the news that Ma Zhanshan is going abroad is confirmed. However, the date of departure is still uncertain. Those close to Ma said that Ma suffered greatly from stimulation after returning home from Europe. He suffers from neurasthenia and stomach problems. Last week, his condition worsened and he was bedridden for several days. Later, two famous acupuncturists were invited from Beiping for diagnosis and treatment, and he was finally cured. Someone recently saw Ma, who was unusually thin and coughed frequently. When discussing the current situation and national affairs, he remained silent. His going abroad is said to be entirely voluntary. He feels that he has become useless since returning home, and the outside world has taken advantage of his seclusion to fabricate rumors. Some people said that Ma was colluding with frustrated warlords and politicians to plan a different movement, and others said that Ma was joining hands with the Japanese to start a new situation in North China. At the same time, the Japanese side is also paying close attention to Ma's actions. Half a month ago, before Sun Dianying invaded the west, he once instructed his staff office, saying that Ma Zhanshan had arrived in Woye and joined the army to cooperate. Sun deliberately spread rumors in order to boost military morale by using Ma's reputation. After the rumors spread, the military and political authorities in North China paid close attention to them and sent representatives to Tianjin to visit Ma and observe his movements. Ma firmly stayed at home and did not leave his door. The representatives returned to Beiping and reported, and the general doubts began to be resolved. Ma decided to take a trip abroad unexpectedly due to the poor domestic environment, partly to avoid the proliferation of rumors and partly to broaden his horizons. Therefore, he specifically telegraphed the Nanchang headquarters to Chiang, requesting permission to travel abroad and was replied with a telegram of approval and an allocation of 30,000 yuan for travel expenses. Ma originally planned to travel before the Chinese New Year, but it was delayed due to illness. It was changed to late February after the Spring Festival. Three attendants were appointed. Before going abroad, he will go to Shanghai to apply for a passport and receive travel expenses. He plans to go to the Philippines first for a short stay, and then go to North and South America to study the military equipment and industries of those regions, preparing to return home and enter the industrial sector. The return trip is expected to take half a year. If time permits, he will also visit Honolulu. Ma's former subordinates, who are stranded in Beiping and have not yet been settled, include 51 officers and 63 junior officers. He had previously submitted a request to the central government for relief and received a reply approving the review and ordering the Beiping branch of the Military Commission to pay 50,000 yuan at one time. Some of the officers and junior officers will be employed by the Military Commission. Ma specially appointed former Heilongjiang Civil Affairs Commissioner Lang Guanshan and Chief of Staff Rong Yuan to handle the matter in Beiping. It is said that each officer can receive 400 yuan, and each junior officer can receive more than 300 yuan. The families of the fallen soldiers will be compensated according to the circumstances.

<h3 id="e91">Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Shandong's Inland Harbors <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Shandong Provincial Government Consults Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Just Negotiations</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Jinan, the Shandong Yellow River coastal area, Yantai, Weihai, Rongcheng Bay, Dingzi Bay, and Jiaozhou Bay are all good harbors, possessing the advantages of both fishing and salt production, and are the foundation of the livelihood of the coastal people. However, due to the weakness of our country's naval forces, bandits come and go at will, hindering the livelihood of fishermen, and the Japanese are even more keen on spying and coveting. Therefore, Japanese fishing boats often invade our territorial waters, vying for our rights and interests. Some time ago, Rongcheng County Chief Zhou Baoli reported to the province that Japanese fishing boats had invaded the port of Shidao. Because the seawater had frozen, the fishing nets were frozen together and could not be moved. They landed on the beach by sampan and went to Xilan Village to find people to help them cut off the fishing nets so that they could return home. Jiang Xijin, the director of the Shidao Public Security Bureau, went to investigate and learned that the fishing boat was named the Third Irigayemaru, carrying five Japanese fishermen, and had sailed from Dalian. After cutting off the fishing nets, they sailed out of Shidao. County Chief Zhou Baoli of the county reported that the Japanese fishing boats had freely invaded our inland harbors to catch fish, which was a violation of our territorial sovereignty. Moreover, the fishing boat was a gasoline boat, and the sound of its sputtering reverberated for several miles, blocking the fish schools and preventing them from returning. As a result, the amount of fish produced along the coast each year has been decreasing, which has a profound impact on our country's fishing industry and the livelihoods of fishermen. Therefore, he specifically requested the provincial government to forward a letter to the Japanese consul, asking him to strictly prohibit this and guarantee that such incidents would not happen again in the future. Based on this, the provincial government submitted it to the political affairs meeting yesterday to discuss solutions. It was decided to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling.

<p>Wang Abused Power and Sold Out Overseas Chinese While Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Punishment Committee Resolves to Suspend Him from Office for Five Years</p>
<p>The National Government's Committee for the Punishment of Political Officials, acting on a previous order from the National Government regarding the case of former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting's disloyalty to the Party, dereliction of duty, abuse of power, humiliation of the nation, selling out overseas Chinese, and currying favor with foreigners, which was brought forward by Supervisory Committee member Zheng Luosheng through impeachment, and after review by the Supervisory Yuan, found the evidence to be conclusive and that the impeached Wang Zhengting should be handed over for punishment. It is reported that after receiving the order, the committee resolved on November 2 of last year that Wang Zhengting's impeachment was based on established facts and that he should be punished with a five-year suspension from office as a form of reprimand. The Supervisory Yuan's original report to the National Government is recorded below: "Reporting on the matter of requesting handover for punishment in accordance with the law. According to Supervisory Committee member Zheng Luosheng's proposal, regarding the Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting's recognition of the Malayan government's suppression of the Chinese Kuomintang's Malayan General Branch, he acted deceitfully and is hereby impeached based on the facts. The committee returned to China on August 25 of last year and reported to the Central Party Headquarters regarding fundraising for rear-area hospitals for disaster relief in the Northwest, which was stopped by the Star Governor Jin Wentai, and he was expelled from the country. It was submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. (Original text omitted.) Looking at Wang Zhengting's various acts of disloyalty to the Party, dereliction of duty, abuse of power, humiliation of the nation, selling out overseas Chinese, and currying favor with foreigners, he should be impeached in accordance with the law. Is this appropriate? We humbly request that it be handed over for review in accordance with the law. One copy of the attachment is submitted herewith." After assigning Supervisory Committee members Xie Wuliang, Luo Jiefu, and Gao Youtang to review it, we now report that, based on the case handed down by Committee member Zheng Luosheng impeaching Foreign Minister Wang Wangting, the committee members' review concluded that the minister's disloyalty to the Party, dereliction of duty, and abuse of power were supported by conclusive evidence and that the impeached person should be handed over for punishment. Based on this, we hereby submit the original attachments and request your government to review and implement them. Respectfully submitted, one.</p>

<p>Since cheap silk fabrics were sold at stalls in this city since the spring, customers flocked to them, and their business surpassed that of the established silk shops. As a result, the stalls gradually changed their scale and expanded their scope, with capital generally ranging from two to three thousand yuan. Shops lined up along Malu Bridge, and the silk fabric industry began to be divided into large and small businesses. Now, Yuan Da Silk Shop, which opened in Guanyi Post, suddenly went bankrupt, reportedly owing more than 10,000 yuan, with only about 3,000 yuan in inventory. The manager, Lu Bogeng, has now hired lawyer Zhang Zhijie to handle the liquidation. The Shanghai silk shops that are owed the most have also sent personnel to Songjiang to hire lawyer Gu Shouyi to handle the pursuit of legal proceedings. All the inventory has now been sent to the county chamber of commerce for sealing and storage, to be used for future compensation.</p>

<p>At the Wang Yougen residence in Xiaocang Tu, outside the West Gate, today (26th) was the occasion of his young son's transfer to a foster family, and relatives and friends gathered for a banquet. Unexpectedly, at around 3 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out in the firewood room of the fifth courtyard. After it was discovered, gongs were sounded to raise the alarm. The West Section Fire Brigade was the first to drive its dragon cart to the scene to put out the fire. Next to the firewood room was the bedroom, and the firefighters climbed onto the roof to dismantle it, so the flames were prevented from spreading, and fortunately, it was preserved.</p>

<p>All districts in this county rely on boats for transportation. Due to the severe cold weather in recent days, the river water has frozen, and the boats have stopped running. Waterway transportation has been completely halted for five days. Fortunately, the long-distance buses on the Sujia Road can pass through the urban area, Bachi, Pingwang, and Shengze, so transportation is still relatively convenient. However, there are quite a few passengers traveling back and forth, and the vehicles are insufficient, so each bus is extremely crowded.</p>

<p>In the case of Han Wentai, the head of Xiexie Township in the Third District (Yangming Township), who was kidnapped by bandits last spring, Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political affairs of the county government, and Xue Furi, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, led detectives to arrest the bandits involved in the case, Li Zhiping, Jiang Hanchen, Yang Abao, Zhou Shungen, and Luo Sanxing, one after another in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Shanghai. The cases of Li and Jiang were handled by the county court, while the cases of Yang, Zhou, and Luo were handled by the county government. On the 17th of this month, the county government obtained approval from the provincial government to execute Yang and Zhou by shooting first, while Luo Sanxing is still in custody awaiting decision. The county court also sentenced Li and Jiang to death and submitted them to the province for review. Later, the provincial government sent the case of Jiang Hanchen back to the original court for retrial, while Li Zhiping was approved for execution. At 1 p.m. yesterday, the county court received the order from the Higher Court forwarded by the province. The prosecutor Ren, together with the warden Sun Gongwu, took their seats in the courtroom and ordered the police to bring the prisoner Li to the court to verify his identity. He was then taken to the South Training Ground and executed by shooting. Prosecutor Ren served as the supervising officer, and Chief Zhou also showed up to announce the charges.</p>

<p>Dafengsheng Rice Shop, located in the Beitang Coal Yard Alley, has been open for many years and is a large-scale operation. On ordinary days, merchants from Jintan, Liyang, Tianjin, Fujian, Zhejiang, Chuzhou, Wuyi, and Liuhe gather here, and business is extremely prosperous. It can be said to be the leader of the rice industry in the county. The owner of the shop, Xu Xiezhang, also serves as the manager, but the actual power of all silver and money transactions is in the hands of the chief accountant, Gong Fengming. In recent years, the market price of rice and grain has plummeted, and the shop has suffered heavy losses year after year. Because Gong Fengming's methods were agile, he could barely maintain it at first, but by last month, it finally became unsustainable. Gong Fengming quietly absconded with 800 yuan, and the shop was stranded. In total, it owes various banks, money shops, warehouses, and customer deposits about 100,000 yuan. The creditors from the silver money industry and the storage industry, seeing that Dafengsheng's liquidation was indefinite, planned to sell the customer goods stored in various warehouses on behalf of the customers to repay the debts. However, after hearing the news, the merchants, whose capital was at stake, jointly sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, asking it to uphold justice and forward the letter to the silver money and storage industry to temporarily retain the goods. A small number of merchant creditors flocked to Dafengsheng to demand payment of their debts, but to no avail.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of last month, the rickshaw pullers in Zhenjiang went on strike because they demanded a reduction in rickshaw rental fees. Later, the military and police authorities stopped them, and after explanations from all parties concerned, no incident occurred. The rickshaw pullers were disappointed with their previous demands. In addition, the weather was cold and the end of the year was approaching, and the market was sluggish. Many of them could hardly feed their families after paying the rickshaw rental fees. After the Zhenjiang Railway Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Zhenyang Automobile Company implemented joint transportation, business became even more slack. In order to maintain their livelihood, more than a hundred rickshaw pullers elected representatives and gathered at the West Railway Station yesterday morning, holding banners and parading in formation. At 10 a.m., they went to the chamber of commerce to request relief and reportedly demanded three things: (1) Cancel the joint transportation between the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Zhenyang Automobile Company; (2) Reduce rickshaw rental fees; (3) Request the winter relief bureau to increase the distribution of rice porridge to rickshaw pullers. The person who received them promised to do everything possible to find a solution. The rickshaw pullers then withdrew. In the afternoon, more than a thousand people gathered at the county sports field, intending to petition the provincial party and government organs again, but they dispersed after being persuaded by the military and police.</p>

The Hua Cheng Construction Company has won the bid for this project and started demolition the day before yesterday. All buildings, plants, and temporary graves within the road alignment area have been ordered by the county government to be moved and removed within a limited time to facilitate the project. If the deadline is exceeded, the county will hire workers to move and remove them on their behalf, and the wages will still be paid by the owners. The demolition and relocation fees and land prices will be collected from the county construction department in accordance with the precedent set during the second phase of the demolition of the city and road construction.</p>

<p>The County Finance Bureau has received instructions from the Provincial Finance and Civil Affairs Departments regarding land with grain shortages. Before the survey and measurement are completed or if they have started but not finished, those who report to the bureau to make up for the grain shortage will be allowed to complete it for one year. If they deliberately delay reporting and are discovered later, they will be handled as overflow land or lost grain land, and they must pay three years of grain tax and register to bear the grain burden. The grain tax collected for one year or three years will be allocated to survey and measurement expenses. This measure has been resolved at the 647th meeting of the Provincial Government Conference and is hereby ordered to all counties. The County Finance Bureau has followed it after receiving the order.</p>

<p>Landlords and Tenants Should Seek Mutual Consideration</p>
<p>How to Handle it Should be Presided Over by the City Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held its 14th Executive Committee meeting yesterday, attended by Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, Lu Wenshao, Wen Lanting, Ma Jiliang, and others, more than twenty people.

Since the "January 28" battle, Shanghai has not recovered. In March of this year, various industries had a rent reduction movement and sent a letter to this association, requesting assistance. This association then sent members to conduct deliberations. It was believed that from a legal point of view, it involves a bilateral contract, and from an economic point of view, it involves the interests of the entire nation. It was resolved at the 86th Standing Committee meeting that landlords and tenants in this city should abide by the principle of mutual assistance and consider each other in order to alleviate the difficulties of both parties. As for how to handle the matter of fairness between landlords and tenants, the City Government should preside over and review it. In addition to advising landlords and tenants, we have submitted a request to the City Government to properly handle the matter. This association still adheres to its past claims regarding the rent reduction movement. Therefore, we will no longer participate in any meetings and will no longer send representatives. Correspondingly, the case is recorded and replied. Please take note.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the report in a certain Western newspaper that the Eurasia Aviation Company is seriously considering suspending the Eurasia air route, Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, solemnly denied it to the Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning and said that although the Eurasia air route has been temporarily suspended due to the Xinjiang war, it is actively preparing for it at all times. The claim that it is seriously considering suspension is inaccurate. Li also said that the Soviet TASS news agency reported that a new government has been established in Kashgar, separating from China. The company has not yet received any telegrams, and the Eurasia air route takes Sun through Dihua and Tacheng, which are far from the reported Kashgar. Even if the TASS report is true, it will not hinder the Eurasia traffic. According to the reporter, Kashgar has two cities, Han and Hui. Hancheng is now Shule County, Xinjiang, and Huicheng is Shufu County. In 1860, according to the Russian treaty, a commercial port was opened in Huicheng, which was the most prosperous in the entire province. Shufu is located on the south bank of the Ulan Wusu River, and Yule is located on the north bank of the Yabuya River, near the Pamir Mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The All-Zhejiang Public Association's Concern for Zhejiang Province's Opium Prohibition <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Two Telegrams Sent Yesterday and the Day Before</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan regarding the opium prohibition case in Zhejiang Province, which reads: "To the esteemed President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, Wang: We have observed that since the Zhejiang Provincial Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Eradicating Drugs, it has been quite effective. Now we understand that the Central Government, due to the revision of the Opium Prohibition Law, has issued a general order to all provinces to abolish their individual regulations within a set time limit. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has already submitted a request for an extension until the end of the 22nd year of the Republic. However, although opium and drugs have been eradicated in Zhejiang Province, neighboring provinces are still in the process of prohibition. The impact of this situation may cause the opium problem in Zhejiang Province to reignite. In addition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting an extension of the implementation period, our association believes that since these individual regulations have been effectively implemented in Zhejiang Province, if the Central Government is truly determined to prohibit opium, it should adopt the Zhejiang method and implement it in all provinces, intensifying the prohibition efforts. In this way, the opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province will not be affected, and there will be a day when the opium disaster in the whole country is eradicated. We humbly submit this report and respectfully request its adoption and implementation. The All-Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai kowtows."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the opium prohibition case in Zhejiang Province, which reads: "To the esteemed Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Lu: At the seventh meeting of the board of directors of our association, it was proposed that your esteemed chairman consult on matters concerning opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province. After discussion, it was deemed necessary to continue extending the Provisional Regulations for Eradicating Drugs and to request the Central Government to adopt the Zhejiang method, implementing it in all provinces and intensifying the prohibition efforts, so that the opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province will not be affected by neighboring provinces. We have already telegraphed the Executive Yuan to adopt and implement this proposal. Furthermore, our association resolved at the end of last year to request a postponement of the dismissal of the opium prohibition committees in various counties. The purpose of this was that although opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province has shown promise, any relaxation would lead to a resurgence of the problem, repeating the mistakes of the third year of the Republic. If the opium prohibition committees continue to exist, they can still fulfill their responsibilities of guidance and supervision. Now that the Provisional Regulations for Eradicating Drugs have been extended, these opium prohibition committees should continue to operate accordingly. We hereby respectfully submit this request, hoping for your consideration. The All-Zhejiang Public Association of Shanghai kowtows."</p>

<p>Seizing Land and Using Civilian Labor, Causing Extreme Hardship and Suffering</p>
<p>Engaging in Large-Scale Construction, Japanese Troops Spread Across the Land, Consolidating Their Territory</p>
<p>A Nominal Government Holds Power, While in War, They Become Sacrifices</p>
<p>Zhang Zishu, the Chief of Staff of the Second Army under Li Futing, formerly of the Jilin Self-Defense Army under Ding Chao, recently returned to Shanghai after conducting an on-site investigation of the situation in Northeast China. As Zhang Xueliang returns to the country from Europe, Representative Zhang brought the report and intended to visit Zhang to report everything. Because Zhang entered Beijing, they have not met. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday visited Chief of Staff Zhang at his residence, who provided a very detailed account of the situation of the Japanese army in the Northeast, as he had observed it during the past two months. Mr. Zhang said, "Since the fall of the Northeast, Japan, in its puppet state of Manchuria, has taken control of all aspects of politics, economy, border defense, finance, land, industry, commerce, real estate, and various construction projects. For the sake of clarity, I will present them in detail below."</p>
<p>Slogans Promoting Japanese-Manchurian Friendship</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese have posted slogans in the puppet state promoting the everlasting friendship between Japan and Manchuria, the stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria to protect the government, and all management, construction, and building activities. (2) Stone forts are being built to guard bridges along the Harbin-Changchun Railway line. Four stone forts are being built on the south and north mountains of Yimianpo, and four stone forts are being built on the north and south mountains of Hengdaohezi. Five stone forts are being built at Hailin Station. More than ten stone forts are being built from Mijiang to Tielinghe, all for the purpose of defending against Russia.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Deployed in Various Parts of Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>(3) Approximately two hundred Japanese troops are stationed in Yimianpo, and approximately one hundred Japanese troops are stationed in Hengdaohezi. About a brigade of Japanese troops is stationed at Hailin Station, Mishan Muling County, Bamiantong, and Tielinghe. The details for the Harbin-Manzhouli line are unknown. (4) Japanese troops are constructing facilities at the wharves and counties along the Songhua River downstream from Harbin to Sanchahe and the Wusuli River. In Harbin's Nangang, fourteen Japanese barracks, all two-story buildings, are being built in front of the Confucian Temple. Each building is sixty zhang long, with more than 120 rooms. The fourteen buildings have a total of more than 1,700 rooms. The airfield covers an area of over 4,000 mu, extending from the west of Jile Temple to Dongmajiagou and from east to Guxiangtun, spanning five li from east to west and four li from north to south, with more than 4,500 mu of land. 1,300 to 1,400 buildings are being constructed, along with thirteen large iron buildings, each nine zhang wide and long, capable of storing ten aircraft. There are two large iron buildings capable of storing twelve aircraft. Three lines of trenches, barbed wire, and electrified fences have been installed. More than 120 aircraft are stored there. Chinese workers are hired as laborers, with five to six hundred people working on construction every day. I worked there for four days, earning eight jiao per day. After paying for food, I had only four jiao left. Only then did I learn the true nature of the facilities. Dozens of Japanese pilots practiced flying every day, ascending to three to four thousand meters, performing flips and turns. The airfield and the pilot and maintenance personnel are permanently stationed by more than 2,000 soldiers. A division of Japanese troops is permanently stationed in Harbin. The first warehouse is at the Eighth Station in Harbin, and the second warehouse is in the Nili Factory south of the Qinjiagang Railway Station. Military equipment, uniforms, and supplies are piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>Building Railways for Military Purposes</p>
<p>(5) The Laha Railway Station is being built under the Wenmiao Kan of Jile Temple in Nangang, Binjiang County, about three or four li long. The section from Sanke Tree in the east of the county to Taga River in Acheng in the southeast is about thirty li east of the railway. The entire line is composed of Japanese streets, and Chinese people are not allowed to loiter there. Armed Japanese citizens are moving in, and construction is underway. (6) The Laji Road from Lalin Cang Street in Acheng County to Jilin City is connected to the Hulan-Hailun Railway via the Lalin Harbin Sanke Tree and the Laha Road. The seventeen spans of the Dajiang Railway Bridge have been completed and will soon be open to traffic. The previously built dirt roads were all constructed by recruiting workers. If there were one hundred households in a village, twenty people would be required to build dirt roads and perform various tasks with the Japanese, and each person would be paid one ocean dollar per day. The railway from Hailun to Heihe has already reached not far from Aigun and is not yet completed. The railway from Heihe, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, to Nehe, is more than two hundred li long. Once completed, it will be open to traffic. (7) Japanese troops are building Yilan County in the southern bank of the lower reaches of the Songhua River, in Jilin Province, with approximately sixty to seventy soldiers. Six stone forts are being built, three along Xiaojiangzi and three east of the street. The airfield is not large and has not been greatly constructed. Approximately three to four hundred Japanese troops are stationed in Jiamusi, in Huachuan County. Eight stone forts are being built on the southern mountain, and three buildings are being built. More than ten li east of the street base below the mountain and six east-west streets are being constructed, about five li away from Jiamusi Street. The airfield has about forty mu of land, and the houses are made of wood and iron. Approximately one hundred and fifty Japanese troops are stationed in Fujin County Street, and there are frequent conflicts with our people's militias. The airfield has four to five hundred mu of land.</p>
<p>The Northeast Corner is a Clean Land</p>
<p>(8) No Japanese troops are stationed in the southeastern counties of Fujin County, such as Baoqing, Mishan, and Boli. Only our people's militias come and go. Japanese troops often go to Huachuan County, Jiamusi, and Fujin to engage in conflicts with our people's militias. No Japanese troops are stationed in the counties of Tongjiang, Raohe, and Hulin, from Sanchahe in the northeast to the Wusuli River. The flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun is hung in Hulin and Raohe counties. The person in charge of Hulin County, Gao Yushan, has three to four thousand men under his command. (9) In the puppet state, the Japanese have the authority to completely search the homes of residents in the four eastern provinces for firearms of all sizes, which must be handed over to the districts, then to the counties, and finally to the Japanese advisory officials for inspection. Those who fail to hand over their firearms will be reported, and their entire family will be executed. The informant will receive a reward of fifty yuan, and the property will be confiscated. In Tangyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, north of the Songhua River, County Magistrate Liu and the Chief of the Internal Affairs Section were executed in the eighth month of the lunar calendar because the disaster relief clothing had not been distributed. The Japanese advisory official dispatched ten Japanese soldiers to the county government, tied up County Magistrate Liu and Chief of the Internal Affairs Section Xia, and executed them outside the government. First, a telegram was sent to Commander Guanglai in Harbin, and then a telegram was sent to Jiang Province.</p>
<p>Tears of Blood of the People of the Puppet State of XinJing</p>
<p>(11) The Japanese are building the puppet state of XinJing in Changchun, which is the new capital of Japan. Each side is thirty li long. Except for the old city, all are Japanese street bases. The Japanese occupied the area outside the west gate of the old city and completely moved our people to the east of the old city. They also built fifteen new streets and allocated land to industrial, commercial, and civilian residents, claiming it was in the west city. The money the Japanese paid for the land they occupied was not enough to buy land in the east city. The people are all crying and weeping, saying that being slaves to a conquered nation is truly unbearable. If they don't sell, they are forced to. They forcibly occupy the land, and they have to move. If they don't move, they forcibly demolish their houses. This is the treatment the people receive, and it is truly unbearable. (11) The Executive Government is in the southwest, but construction has not yet begun. Puyi used to live in a building on Qima Road but has now moved to a small room in the salt warehouse office on Liuma Road. The interior is guarded by the Japanese, with two floors, and the exterior is guarded by the Imperial Guard of the puppet state, with two-story guard posts. Movement is not free. The Japanese are building the headquarters of the Kwantung Governor-General, a seven-story building, all made of ceramic bricks and tiles, very sturdy. Opposite the Japanese station is a main road, about two li away from the station, on the west side of the road. It is better built than the Korean Governor-General's Office. To the north are four Japanese barracks, capable of housing two divisions, each occupying approximately four thousand mu of land, totaling over eighteen thousand mu. (12) There are two airfields. The northeastern airfield is approximately four thousand seven hundred mu, with more than 1,500 buildings and fourteen large iron buildings, each capable of storing ten aircraft. The airfield on the north side is slightly smaller, approximately four thousand mu, with over a thousand buildings and seven large iron buildings, storing the same number of aircraft as the other two, one hundred and eighty or ninety aircraft. The airfield is staffed by approximately four thousand pilots, maintenance personnel, and guards. Several lines of tunnels and electrified fences have been constructed, with very strict security. To build the airfields, over a thousand Chinese laborers are working at both locations. The main streets opposite the train station all have large squares marked with standards. The Chinese laborers working in Changchun earn eight jiao per day, with three to four ten thousand.</p>
<p>The Puppet State's Currency is Managed by the Japanese</p>
<p>(13) In terms of the economy, in June of the third year of the puppet state, an announcement was issued to all provinces that all miscellaneous currencies would be abolished and that all miscellaneous tickets would be exchanged for puppet state currency as soon as possible. Next year, everything will be converted to puppet state currency. The Japanese military's salaries and needs in the puppet state are paid as follows: general officers receive 2,600-2,800 yuan per month, field grade officers receive 1,600-1,800 yuan, junior officers receive 500-800 yuan, and enlisted men and servants receive 50-90 yuan. All expenses are paid by the puppet state bank, and salaries are paid on the 25th of each month. The Japanese say that since they are helping Manchuria fight, all revenue from customs and duties is managed by the Japanese. (14) The Japanese-Korean Rice Field Joint-Stock Company is established in Abin County and other places, purchasing land adjacent to the river from the people. Land worth three hundred yuan is given one hundred yuan. One qing is ten mu. Land of medium quality is given fifty yuan for ten mu. Land with trees, fodder, and wasteland is given a price of twenty or ten yuan, or less. If they don't sell, they are forcibly assessed. (15) The Japanese military calculates that they have small conflicts with the Northeastern People's Army every day. Every day, people from the four eastern provinces and Inner Mongols enter the pass. The puppet state has established the Xin'an Province, where there are also many people's militias who often resist the Japanese military. (16) High-altitude telegraphs are installed along the South Manchuria Railway line, from Lushunkou, Dalian, Korea, Andong, Fushun, and Ji Hui. The routes all have large iron frames and high-altitude currents. The railways are all double-tracked. Slogans are posted at each station and town: "Japanese-Manchurian Friendship and Joint Rule."</p>
<p>Japanese Education Destroys People's Knowledge</p>
<p>(17) Education focuses on the Japanese language. Currently, the first and second middle schools in the Harbin Special District have been abolished, and two middle schools in the new puppet state of XinJing have been abolished. Gradually, all middle schools will be abolished, leaving only high primary schools. People are required to study old Confucian books to qualify, and scientific books are used less. This is to destroy people's knowledge so that later generations of young people will not have knowledge. (18) The Japanese are managing the mining industry, actively developing all mining operations, including gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead. The French also want to invest, but no agreement has been reached. Two gold factories have been established, one in Huapi Gou in Hualdian County, Jilin Province, and one in Baisha River, Dongning County. Both places produce very good gold. This is the mining industry in operation. The Donglaoye Ridge glass mine in Yanshou County has been inspected and will be developed. A large woolen mill has been established in Harbin and is currently under construction at the Nitong Railway Station. (19) The Japanese have arrested more than twenty people from the Chinese Eastern Railway, including Russian officials. The Russian consul and railway director have all returned to their country. Japan and Russia are actively preparing for war, and Japanese military supplies are piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Old and Reducing the New to Prepare for the Enemy Russia</p>
<p>(20) The Japanese are planning to eliminate the old army of the puppet state and increase the new army, starting with Liaoning. Each county police district will have thirty men, aged eighteen to forty, trained by the Japanese to prepare for the enemy Russia. Therefore, the people are panicked. The people of the Northeast are crying out to the heavens and earth. In the future, the people of the Northeast provinces will shed rivers of blood, and their white bones will face the sky. The Japanese have informed all counties in Jilin and the Northeast to prepare more than three thousand large carts for war use. (21) The harvest in the four northeastern provinces is very good. The Japanese have issued an order to quickly harvest the rice and actively push rice, storing it in grass bags. Mung beans are seven or eight yuan per shi, with a weight of four or five hundred jin per shi. Red sorghum rice is four jiao per dou, with no market. The wages for plowing and hoeing in the spring are very high. The Japanese have notified the counties to urge the collection of rents and taxes, and various official fees are still collected by the puppet state, which must be paid quickly. The farmers work hard all year, and the harvested grain is not enough to spend, and the people's livelihood is truly unsustainable, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Two District Party Headquarters Hold Large-Scale National Products Promotion Week <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled from the 28th to February 3rd</p>
<p>Propaganda Areas such as Shanghai and Suzhou Have Been Determined</p>
<p>The special party headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways has scheduled a National Products Promotion Week to be held on January 28th (tomorrow), and has ordered party headquarters in various districts and labor union organizations to lead the promotion of national products and pledge to purchase and use national products. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency is now recording the propaganda materials and methods printed by the department, as follows:</p>
<p>Unite to Promote National Products</p>
<p>All members of the nation and ethnic group should strive to promote national products, and especially to practice what they preach, because promoting national products can save the bankruptcy of the countryside, the decline of industry and commerce, the exhaustion of finance, and the danger of the nation and ethnic group. Taking agriculture as an example, promoting national products can resist the dumping of food by imperialists, increase the price of our agricultural products, and sell them well in various places, so as to increase the income of farmers, improve the livelihood of farmers, and establish the foundation of our national economy. Taking industry as an example, promoting national products can use China's rich natural resources to develop various industries, develop domestic resources, promote social production, and increase national wealth. Taking commerce as an example, promoting national products can eliminate the current unbalanced phenomenon, completely stop the shameful behavior of traitorous merchants buying and selling for foreigners to extract the cream of compatriots, and make Chinese merchants all become members of promoting social production. If business circles promote national products and use the recovered profits to circulate finance and revitalize China's industrial and commercial enterprises, then Chinese society will be able to prosper day by day. Taking national finance as an example, promoting national products can fully develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, and national finance will inevitably tend to stability, and national income can be drastically increased. With the country rich and the domestic power sufficient, all construction of the country can be actively promoted in order to seek economic independence of the country. Therefore, promoting national products is necessary in all aspects. To put it more clearly, promoting national products is the only way to love and save the country, to defeat the economic aggression of the imperialists, and the only force for the Chinese nation to fight for survival. May all compatriots unite to promote national products, and everyone practice what they preach. "Everyone works hard, promotes national products, and uses national products." Issued by the National Products Promotion Propaganda Conference of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways.</p>
<p>Must Wear a Certain National Products Uniform</p>
<p>Start with the comrades of the party headquarters of this road. Because promoting national products should not only rely on propaganda, but should also be practiced from the beginning. Most of the comrades in this association and the party members of the whole road use foreign goods, and their psychology of loving foreign goods is because foreign goods are cheap and beautiful. The empty patriotism cannot overcome the psychology of loving beauty and being greedy for cheap. Now, in order to promote national products, the party headquarters should use the means of regulation to force comrades to use national products. At least it should be stipulated that when they are engaged in work, they must wear a certain national products uniform. If so, not only can they avoid being criticized by others, but they can also gain considerable benefits in praising the new spirit of the nation, and can also be a model and advocate for the people.</p>
<p>Propaganda Methods Are Held Separately</p>
<p>Hold National Products Propaganda Week, in accordance with the first provision of the National Products Propaganda Week method promulgated by the central government, this association will jointly organize a large-scale National Products Movement Propaganda Week with the Road Bureau and the two-road labor union. The date is from this month (January 28th) to February 3rd, and the lower-level party headquarters are ordered to hold separately at the same time. (Propaganda Area) (1) Shanghai, January 28th. (2) Suzhou, January 29th. (3) Changzhou, January 29th. (4) Zhenjiang, January 30th. (5) Nanjing, January 30th. (6) Jiaxing, January 30th. (7) Hangzhou, January 31st. (8) Zhakou, January 31st. (9) Ningbo, January 30th. (10) Baisha, January 30th. (Organize a Propaganda Team) Members will be dispatched by the association in conjunction with the Road Bureau Labor Union to form teams of two people, first organizing four teams to go to various districts to assist and guide the local area to hold propaganda conferences. (Propaganda Materials) (1) Leaflets. (2) Slogans. (3) Illustrations. (4) Others.</p>
<h3 id="e118">China's Trade with Spain <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Decreased Last Year Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>According to the news released by the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau yesterday, China's exports to Spain have always been dominated by the silk industry and porcelain, while imports have been mostly machinery, vehicles, chemicals, paper, alcohol, etc. However, in recent years, China's export goods have failed to improve and compete with others, so the export volume has been far less than in the past. According to the investigation, Spain's total imports in 1932 were worth 925,72,628 gold pesetas, and China's imports were 2,876,193 gold pesetas (each gold peseta is approximately equal to one Chinese yuan), accounting for only 3/1000 of the total imports, ranking 40th among the trade positions of various countries. The commercial relations between China and Spain have not been fully developed. China was once famous in the world for its silk, tea, and porcelain, but in recent years, it has plummeted. Taking Spain as an example, in 1932, the total value of imported silk fabrics was 24,877,878 gold pesetas, of which Italy accounted for 13,116,177, France accounted for 4,916,567, Germany accounted for 300,841, Switzerland accounted for 1,287,562, the Netherlands accounted for 849,446, Belgium accounted for 499,667, and China only imported 144,406 gold pesetas, which is vastly different from other countries. In terms of porcelain, in 1932, Spain's total import value was 749,775, of which Germany accounted for 419,575, Czechoslovakia accounted for 133,647, Japan accounted for 91,867, and China only imported 5,991 gold pesetas. In terms of tea, in 1932, Spain imported 394,887 gold pesetas, of which British India imported 317,917, and China only 70,543. China was once a major exporter of silk, tea, and porcelain, but now it is far behind others. Although the reasons are not one-sided, China's production technology does need to be improved: (1) The reduction of production costs must be rationalized. (2) The decoration must be beautiful. (3) The materials must be clean, so that China can have hope of restoring its international trade.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Special Dredger Ordered from Germany <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Will Arrive in Early Spring Next Year</p>
<p>To Dredge the Silt at the Mouth of the River</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the 40 million tons of silt at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and how to dredge it to make the river mouth 9 feet deep so that large ships can enter and exit, has long been a difficult problem. Recently, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has ordered a special dredger from Germany, so this problem can be solved. The price is approximately 2.35 million yuan at the current exchange rate. It is not yet possible to determine how long it will take to dredge all the silt. The machine will arrive in early spring next year and will begin work immediately. The proposal to deepen the waterway at the mouth of the Yangtze River was first proposed about 60 years ago, but it was shelved due to the scale of the project. In recent years, Huangpu Conservancy engineers, Dr. Chatley, repeatedly investigated the situation at the mouth of the river, prepared a report, and submitted it to the government, which was finally approved. The special dredger ordered is the result of years of research by the bureau. It can dredge three tons of mud every ten hours. Dr. Chatley told a representative of the North China Daily News that the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has been considering the issue of deepening the waterway at the mouth of the Yangtze River for fourteen years. The heavy accumulation of silt at the mouth of the river is a major obstacle for ships with deeper drafts. In 1876, the former chief engineer, Mr. Trigick, advocated deepening the mouth of the river, but no one paid attention to it. It was not until 1915 that he jointly discussed this matter with the Jianghai Customs and made a special investigation. In 1920, Dr. Chatley prepared a report for Mr. Hedenstam, stating the possibility of deepening the mouth of the river with a suction dredger. This report was passed by the International Advisory Engineering Committee of the Shanghai Port Investigation Office the following year and submitted to the government. Finally, with the assistance of the chairman of the bureau, Song Ziwen, it was approved by the Executive Yuan in 1930. In 1933, bids were solicited for the construction of the first special dredger. There were ten bidders from various countries, and the German Shizhou Trading Company offered the lowest price and had special experience in manufacturing this type of machine, so it won the bid. The machine looks like a cargo ship, 360 feet long and 60 feet wide, with a draft of 18 feet when carrying 4,000 tons of mud. It can dredge 25,000 cubic yards of mud per day, or more than 30,000 tons of mud every ten hours. The dredged mud will be dumped into the sea two miles away. The Huangpu Conservancy Bureau has specially dispatched the dredging engineer of the bureau, Mr. Smith, and two Chinese mechanical engineers to Germany to supervise the construction. It is expected to be completed and shipped to Shanghai in early spring next year.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Yanjing University Alumni Association Fetes Dr. Leighton Stuart <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>7 PM Tomorrow Evening at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA</p>
<p>Dr. Leighton Stuart, the provost of Yenching University in Peiping, President Zhou Yichun, Professor Liu Tingfang, and others have recently come to Shanghai one after another for official business. The Shanghai Alumni Association of Yenching University has specially scheduled a banquet for them at 7 PM on the 28th (tomorrow) on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA and invited the chairman of the board of directors of the school, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, the president of the First Special District Court Guo Yunguan, and others to accompany them. There are more than 200 Yenching University alumni in Shanghai, and it will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Public Concession Bureau Annual Health Report for Last Year <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Suffer More Severe Stomach Ailments</p>
<p>More Attention Should Be Paid to Food Safety</p>
<p>The Acting Director of the Health Department of the Public Concession Bureau submitted a report to the Board of Directors on the work for the entire previous year, stating that the year was generally peaceful with no unexpected events. Except for a slight spread of influenza in July and August, there were very few other disasters.</p>
<p>Birth and Death Statistics: The birth rate of foreigners this year was 17.87 per thousand. This statistic is being published for the first time in this district, based on reports provided by doctors and hospitals, and is generally considered accurate. As for Chinese residents, many are still unaware of the importance of registration, and a considerable number of newborns, especially girls, are abandoned. Fewer births are attended by hospitals and doctors, so it is difficult to obtain accurate statistics at this time.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths: The death rate for foreigners was 11.29 per thousand. The reported death rate for Chinese was 12.82 per thousand (compared to 17.65 in the previous year). However, 42 percent of the deaths, or 5,715 cases, were unclaimed bodies. Therefore, this number for the Chinese is not suitable for comparison. If mandatory registration were implemented, there might be some improvement in the results. However, due to various customs, it is feared that the degree of inaccuracy would still not be easily corrected.</p>
<p>Infectious Diseases: This year, stomach ailments were more prevalent, and the reported number of Chinese sufferers increased significantly, with many deaths. This may be due to incomplete reporting or the particularly severe nature of the disease in this area. Furthermore, considering the prevalence of stomach ailments, more attention should be paid to food safety. Although the Health Department has made every effort to ensure food safety, residents should not therefore neglect to take their own precautions. No cases of cholera occurred this year, which is a rare occurrence in this city. This may be because the disease spread so widely last year that most people have now acquired immunity. In addition, the supply of water to the common people and the implementation of various vaccination methods have contributed to this success. Alternatively, it may be due to the cyclical nature of the disease, with this year being a period of dormancy. At this moment, it is not possible to determine definitively, but we cannot be optimistic about the coming year.</p>
<p>Hospital Issues: After the Board of Directors adopted the report of the Hospital Issues Investigation Committee, the Health Department formulated a construction plan for the Western District Fever Hospital, as recommended, and construction will begin as soon as a site is selected. The planned mental hospital will require further modifications after the plan has been drafted. Furthermore, regarding the request for subsidies by private hospitals, a framework will soon be established to define standards for the construction and equipment of hospitals seeking assistance, in order to ensure effectiveness and uniformity.</p>
<p>New Slaughterhouse: The Bureau's new slaughterhouse has been completed and gradually put into use in November and December. Slaughtering is performed entirely using the most humane methods. The waste meat disposal machine should be moved out of the slaughterhouse immediately, preferably to a location opposite. The new meat market and cold storage facilities are currently under construction. The Bureau-operated pig slaughterhouse is being planned for expansion, and it seems necessary to find a larger site to allow for full equipment. For the sake of public health and the Bureau's revenue, this business should be gradually expanded.</p>
<p>Milk Sterilization: Regarding the issue of mandatory sterilization of Grade B milk, a committee has been appointed by the Bureau to study the matter after it was presented by the Health Department, and the process is not yet complete. The sale of "white-collapse oil" and vegetable "white-collapse oil" has been subject to new licensing regulations, which limit the use of preservatives to two parts per thousand and also allow the use of non-toxic colorings.</p>
<p>School Inspections: All schools receiving subsidies are regularly inspected for cleanliness. At the end of the year, physical examinations were initiated on a trial basis at one Chinese primary school. The results are certain to be of great value.</p>
<p>Publicity Work: Because public health was good this year, some progress has been made in health education. Various new slogans and illustrations have been posted in the health sub-bureaus and on billboards in various locations, and the tram and bus companies have provided special assistance by posting advertisements on their vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Joint Announcement by Jianghai Customs <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Berlot, Customs Commissioner, yesterday jointly issued two announcements regarding the revised standards for classifying and taxing imported diesel and kerosene, as well as amendments to the regulations for general cargo warehouses. The announcements are as follows:</p>
<p>Revised Standards for Diesel and Kerosene Taxes: We have now received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that, for imported diesel and kerosene with related properties, the following classifications are established as standards for taxation: (A) Diesel: Specific gravity at 20 degrees Celsius above 0.900 and flash point (according to the Cless method) above 95 degrees Celsius, taxed at 2.90 gold units per ton. (B) Other (including crude oil for extraction), taxed at 26.30 gold units per ton. Kerosene (including other mineral oils for ignition, with a specific gravity of 0.78 to 0.90) will be taxed at the same rate as before. We are to comply accordingly. Therefore, we must comply. The measure specified in Joint Announcement No. 1268, which requires merchants importing diesel to guarantee that it will not be used for refining kerosene, is hereby abolished. All merchants are to be informed accordingly. This announcement is made.</p>
<p>Amendment to Cargo Warehouse Regulations:</p>
<p>The government has now ordered that Article 18 of the regulations for general cargo warehouses be amended as follows: Article 18. Merchants who wish to remove goods from the warehouse for export overseas must first submit a declaration for the removal of goods for export, along with a guarantee that, should any irregularities occur, they will pay a sum no more than ten times the assessed tax amount within the period specified by Customs. Only after Customs verifies that the declaration matches the goods will a permit for the removal of goods for export be issued, and the goods released. If, after obtaining the permit and removing the goods from the warehouse, the merchant fails to ship all or part of the goods on the designated vessel, Customs may enforce the guarantee and require the merchant to pay the taxes due on the goods as stated in the permit. If Customs discovers, during loading, that all or part of the goods do not match the goods stated in the permit, or if the goods have been loaded and shipped but are unloaded privately in other parts of China with the intention of evasion, Customs may enforce the guarantee for the full amount. Merchants who wish to remove goods from the warehouse for bonded transport to other treaty ports must first submit a declaration for the removal of goods for bonded transport to other treaty ports, along with a guarantee that, if the goods are not declared for import at the Customs of the designated port following established procedures, the merchant will pay the import duties. Only after Customs verifies that the declaration matches the warehouse records will a permit for the removal of goods for bonded transport to other treaty ports be issued, and the goods released. If, after obtaining the permit and removing the goods from the warehouse, the merchant fails to ship the goods on the designated vessel as specified in the permit, Customs may act according to the guarantee. As for shut-out cargo, whether originally declared for export overseas or to other treaty ports, merchants may take delivery of the goods after paying import duties or return the goods to the Customs warehouse, as they see fit. However, the 12-month storage period will still be calculated from the date of the initial entry into the warehouse. These measures regarding the issuance of guarantees and the shipment of goods will take effect on March 1, 1934, and all goods removed from Customs warehouses from that date onward must be handled in accordance with these measures. All merchants are to be informed accordingly. This announcement is made.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Coastal Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications Received SOS Signal from Japanese Ship Yesterday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the coastal radio station of the Ministry of Communications received a distress signal from the Japanese ship Tai'an Maru No. 2 yesterday morning. The ship ran aground near Moji in the Straits of Shimonoseki at 3:30 AM yesterday morning and is currently inspecting for leaks and damage. The ship's distress signal was sent using the Japanese code and then resent by a Japanese station using the international code. No further communication has been received, and its current condition is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e124">People’s, Zhongnan, and 24 Other Cigarette Manufacturers Request Change in Tax Rates <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Because Second-Level Tax Treatment of Chinese and Foreign Businesses is Extremely Unequal</p>
<p>Petition to the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance ordered the adoption of a two-tier cigarette tax system, with a tax rate of 120% for lower-grade cigarettes and 36% for higher-grade cigarettes, Chinese businesses, with their smaller capital, mostly deal in lower-grade cigarettes, putting them at a disadvantage, making it difficult to operate and maintain their business. Now, 24 cigarette manufacturers, including People's and Zhongnan, have jointly petitioned the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Bureau to request a change in the tax rate to protect Chinese manufacturers. The following is an excerpt from their petition: Petition to request that the current cigarette tax rate, which is unfair to Chinese and foreign businesses, be promptly revised to provide relief. (Omission)</p>
<p>Cigarette Consolidated Tax</p>
<p>was initiated in 1929. In November 1930, February 1931, and March 1932, the tax was revised three times. From July 1929 to November 1930, there was a seven-tier tax system; from November 1930 to February 1931, there was an old three-tier tax system; from February 1931 to March 1932, there was a new three-tier tax system; and from March 1932 to the present, there has been a two-tier tax system. (Omission) If the tax rate is divided into more tiers, the burden of the upper, middle, and lower taxes will vary in proportion to the quality of the cigarettes, so the burden of lower-grade cigarettes is lighter, giving Chinese businesses an advantageous position, and domestic tobacco leaves also sell well. If the tax rate is divided into fewer tiers, the burden of the upper, middle, and lower grades of cigarettes will not be very different, or even the burden of lower-grade cigarettes may exceed that of upper and middle-grade cigarettes by one or two parts, so the burden of upper and middle-grade cigarettes is lighter, giving British and American businesses an advantageous position, and domestic tobacco leaves also become difficult to sell. According to past experience, the seven-tier tax is most beneficial to Chinese businesses, followed by the three-tier tax, while the two-tier tax clearly gives special privileges to British and American businesses, leaving Chinese businesses with no power to resist. Therefore, during the seven-tier tax era, there were a total of 156 Chinese businesses. After the implementation of the two-tier tax, the increase was still 410,000, but now it has increased to one and decreased to 170,000. This is the result of reducing taxes on upper-grade cigarettes and increasing taxes on lower-grade cigarettes. As a result, the burden on British and American businesses has been sharply reduced, while the burden on Chinese businesses has doubled. No wonder that in one year, British and American businesses have made rapid progress, while the bankruptcies of Chinese businesses have accounted for almost two-thirds of the total. It cannot be said that the tax rate is not bad, benefiting British and American businesses at the expense of Chinese businesses. Is this something that the government, which cares for industry and Chinese businesses, would willingly do? Perhaps the advantages and disadvantages of this matter are not yet clear. (Omission)</p>
<p>The result of this year's tax change</p>
<p>is that the tax on lower-grade cigarettes has increased from 90% to more than 120%, while the tax on upper-grade cigarettes has decreased from 47% to 36%. Those who can afford to smoke cigarettes costing 300 yuan per case are wealthy merchants and magnates who have the ability to pay taxes and should bear a heavier burden. Those who smoke cigarettes costing 120 yuan per case are poor and humble people who lack the ability to pay taxes and should bear a lighter burden. (Omission) It may be said that the tax of 160 yuan collected on cigarettes above 300 yuan under the first-tier tax is not heavy. However, the sales of cigarettes above 300 yuan are extremely rare, and the 20 yuan allowance allowed outside the place of manufacture is almost equal to zero. In essence, the first-tier tax is just a decoration of the tax system, and only the second-tier tax is actually implemented, with cigarettes around 300 yuan only collecting 36%. (Omission) The tobacco leaves used in the lower and middle-grade cigarettes produced by Chinese businesses are produced in Henan, Shandong, and Anhui, or American tobacco leaves, or domestic tobacco leaves from Huanggang, Junzhou, Deng, Susong, and Xinchang. The annual output of American and domestic tobacco leaves is about 150 million pounds, with an average selling price of 20 cents per pound, and farmers earn about 30 million yuan annually. The government's flue-cured tobacco tax is 4 yuan and 15 cents per 100 catties, with a tax revenue of about 4.5 million yuan. The annual output of domestic tobacco leaves from Huanggang and Junzhou is about 100 million pounds, and the income of the government and farmers is worth one-third of the American and domestic tobacco leaves. During the seven-tier tax era, the tax rate and the value of the cigarettes were mutually standardized, so domestic tobacco leaves sold best. When the three-tier tax system was changed, the tax on upper-grade cigarettes was cheap, and the tax on lower-grade cigarettes was expensive, so the sales of American leaves</p>
<p>Collapsed one after another.</p>
<p>Now there are only 30 to 40 left, and in recent years the sales have decreased sharply and many have suffered losses. At the beginning of the two-tier tax system in 1932, merchants and people from all over the world opposed it, knowing that the treatment was unfair and that they were unable to compete with the British and Americans. (Omission) First, let's talk about the consumption of stamps. According to the regulations of the consolidated tax, every 50,000 cigarettes is a large case, and one stamp is affixed. The number of stamps consumed is the number of cases of cigarettes sold. During the three-tier tax era, the average number of British and American companies was 30,472, and the average number of other companies was 68,422. The number of British and American cigarettes sold was only 40% of the other companies, less than 50%. During the two-tier tax era, the average number of British and American companies was 48,808, and the average number of other companies was 44,323. The number of British and American cigarettes sold exceeded the other companies by 4,485. Alas, in one year, British and American companies have made such rapid progress, and Chinese businesses have declined so much. Those who have a heart cannot fail to lose their color and courage when they hear about it. Next, let's talk about</p>
<p>Tax payments.</p>
<p>During the three-tier tax era, the average number of British and American tobacco companies was 2,417,403.822, and the average number of other tobacco companies was 2,006,252.647. The burden of British and American companies was 410,000 more than that of Chinese businesses. During the two-tier tax era, the average number of British and American tobacco companies was 2,726,392.522, and the average number of other tobacco companies was 2,554,466.996. The burden of British and American companies was only 170,000 more than that of Chinese businesses. Comparing these two tables, during the three-tier tax era, although the sales of British and American companies were less than 50% of those of Chinese businesses, the amount of taxes paid each month was 410,000 more than that of Chinese businesses. The reason is that the quality of the cigarettes is good, and the selling price is high, so the tax is also high, which is very reasonable. Now that it has been changed to a two-tier tax, the number of British and American cigarettes sold, which was less than 50% of that of Chinese businesses, has increased to one. If the tax rate is fair, the amount of taxes paid by British and American companies should be at least doubled compared to Chinese businesses, but the fact is that it is only 170,000 more each month. The former sales were less than 50%, and the monthly tax payment</p>
<p>Took away domestic products.</p>
<p>Half of the tobacco leaves, last year the consolidated tax was changed to two-tier, and lower-grade cigarettes became even more difficult to establish themselves, so domestic tobacco leaves from Huanggang and Junzhou were not sold at all. This year, compared with last year, the tobacco leaves from Xuzhou, Weixian, and Fengyang were high in price and cheap in price, but there were fewer buyers, which was also affected by the heavy tax on lower-grade cigarettes. The prosperity and decline of lower-grade cigarettes are closely related to the sales of domestic tobacco leaves. If lower-grade cigarettes disappear from the market due to heavy taxes, the sales of domestic tobacco leaves will be cut off immediately. Not only will the government's tobacco tax suffer a great loss, but the rural areas will also go bankrupt as a result. Therefore, heavy taxation of lower-grade cigarettes is tantamount to suffocating the source of tax, directly harming Chinese businesses, and indirectly harming tobacco farmers. At this time of rural bankruptcy and rampant bandits, can the government not consider the millions of tobacco farmers and bear to put them in this dead place and drive fish into the abyss? (Omission) Urgent words, I hope to be adopted. In addition to being submitted separately, it is respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Tax Bureau, which are presented by the cigarette companies of the people, the Yoli cigarette factory, the Yonghe tobacco company, the China Dada cigarette factory, the Jiuyi cigarette company, the Jinshan cigarette factory, the Huafu cigarette factory, the Changming tobacco company, the Delong cigarette factory, the China Huaxing cigarette company, the Asia tobacco company, the Yuxin cigarette factory, the Xinmin cigarette factory, Huamei Tobacco Co., Ltd., Huaqing Tobacco Company, Jinsha Taiji Tobacco Company, Shanghai China Pacific Tobacco Company, Shanghai Tobacco Company, China Greater Southeast Ocean Tobacco Company, Zhongnan Cigarette Factory, Kefu Cigarette Company, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cigarette Company, Hexing Cigarette Factory, Zhonghe Cigarette Company.</p>

<h3 id="e125">National Medical Association Submits to Ministry of Interior to Train Old-Style Midwives <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The National Medical Association believes that the responsibilities of midwives are significant. Although the authorities have promulgated the "Midwives Ordinance," they have not strictly enforced it in the five years since, resulting in occasional transgressions. Old-style midwives continue to run rampant everywhere. Yesterday, the Association specially submitted a document to the Ministry of Interior requesting that local health authorities strictly enforce the law, stating: "Submitting this document to request the Ministry of Interior to order local health authorities to strictly enforce the Midwives Ordinance and train old-style midwives in order to value human lives. It is believed that midwives hold the lives of both mothers and infants in their hands, with the power of life and death. Their responsibilities are of utmost importance. Therefore, all advanced countries in the East and West have specially enacted ordinances to manage them with utmost rigor. In the past, even the Beijing government, amidst its deep-rooted bad habits and political decay, recognized the importance of this matter and promulgated the "Registration of Midwives and Training of Midwives Ordinance," which was deemed appropriate by knowledgeable individuals. Our National Government, at the beginning of its tutelage, was determined to revitalize the country. The "Examination Rules for Midwives" were promulgated earlier, followed by the "Midwives Ordinance," demonstrating the authorities' concern for the people's well-being. However, for the past five years, midwives in various regions have inevitably committed transgressions, and old-style birth attendants continue to run rampant everywhere, with no end in sight. This is likely due to the failure of local health authorities to effectively enforce the laws. The Association is alarmed and distressed and unable to provide remedies. It is deeply concerned that if this continues, it will become increasingly difficult to rectify the situation. Therefore, the Second Congress of Representatives resolved to request the Ministry to actively supervise local health authorities to strictly enforce the Midwives Ordinance, while also initiating the training of old-style midwives to strive for a safe transition between the old and new systems. We hereby submit ten articles of advice on the general principles of midwife training for your review and implementation. We await your command with utmost anticipation. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Interior, with attached advice on the general principles of midwife training: (1) Name: Midwife Training Center of a certain city or county. (2) Purpose: To teach the essential points and methods of midwifery, so that old-style midwives who have been engaged in midwifery can learn the points to pay attention to during childbirth. (3) Qualifications: Old-style midwives who have been recognized by the police station or public security bureau will be compelled to study by the health authorities. Those who disobey will be prohibited from operating. (4) Duration: Three months, twice a week, for at least two hours each time. The time will be determined by the training center. (5) Subjects: Outline of human anatomy and physiology, methods of fetal position diagnosis, methods of perineal protection, methods of umbilical cord ligation, disinfection methods, emergency methods, fetal resuscitation methods, with an emphasis on practical exercises. Use illustrations and models to demonstrate. Use oral instruction without handouts. (6) Enrollment: Each class will be limited to 50 students. If the number exceeds the limit, two classes will be set up. (7) Location and faculty: The health authorities will entrust official or public or equivalent private hospitals, and the faculty will be concurrently staffed by the staff of those hospitals, all on a voluntary basis. (8) Tuition: Entirely free. (9) Graduation: Those who attend all sessions and pass the oral examination will be given a certificate. Those who fail will be ordered to enter the second class to continue listening. (10) Implementation: These general principles will be followed by the local</p>
<p>Health authorities to implement, and the progress and dates of commencement will be reported to the superior authorities for filing with the Ministry. The same will be done upon graduation.</p>

<p>Held North Station Station Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>Resolved Various Reform Cases</p>
<p>The Two Railways Bureau held three consecutive meetings in the Traffic Department meeting room to improve the Shanghai North Station's station operations. The attendees included Zheng Baozhao, Yuan Shaochang, Xie Wenlong, Wang Zhigang, Tang Huannan, Wang Shuchun, Sun Suizhi, Zou Quxin, Li Zhaoyu, Chen Guoliang, Jin Zhu, Liang Ying, Pu Zijun, Shi Debi, Ouyang Zhi, and Fu Mengxiong, a total of sixteen people. The chairman was Yuan Shaochang, and the recorder was Tang Xiongjie. The various motions passed are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Director's Instructions</p>
<p>First, Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Traffic Department, delivered a speech, saying: "Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, ranking fourth among the world's major commercial ports. Chinese and foreigners live together, and its importance is evident. The North Station is also the hub of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, with tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign passengers every day. Whether its management is appropriate or not has a significant impact on international reputation. Therefore, all facilities at the station must be improved at any time to meet the needs. This is the original intention of convening today's meeting. As for the key points of improvement, there are roughly two: (1) material improvement, such as the construction of station buildings and all other facilities in the station, etc.; (2) spiritual improvement, such as the diligence of employees, the speed of handling, and the harmony, integrity, etc. We should pay attention to both of these, and we should not allow any neglect, then the station affairs will progress day by day, which can be expected. If you want to seek any improvement in your career, it is impossible to succeed without gathering the strength of all and working together. Therefore, the colleagues at the North Station must be consistent from top to bottom, regardless of each other, and for the employees of other departments of this road and all relevant parties, such as the municipal government, security department, public security bureau, banking industry, hotel industry, automobile industry, and transportation industry, we should contact each other and assist each other. For the employees under their jurisdiction, it is necessary to be selfless, to take talents as the standard, and to treat everyone equally, without taking private friendship as a prerequisite. For passengers and merchants, regardless of rank, they should be treated kindly, whether they are wholesale or retail. All customers should be treated well. For superiors, they should follow the instructions of the Director to the section chiefs last time, breaking away from sentimentality, being honest and reliable, and not deceiving the old and young, and not discounting them. Check this record of instructions. It is necessary for all colleagues to read it, so it has been printed by this office and distributed to each section station. I hope that you can follow it at any time and contribute suggestions for improvement at any time."</p>

(3) Set up vending stalls and eliminate platform vendors. (Resolution) Platform vendors should be eliminated immediately. Vending stalls should be set up near the inspection station of the Public Security Bureau in the west of the station, and there is no need to set up more inside the station to maintain cleanliness.

<p>The Railway Bureau Continues to Raise 767 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>To Gather a Total of 3,000 Yuan for the Bereaved Family of Liu</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that on January 9th of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], Liu Rongtai, the president of the Zhabei Fire Brigade in Shanghai, set out to fight a fire. Due to reckless driving, he was hit by a Shanghai-Nanjing Railway train and died. His bereaved family's request for compensation remained unresolved for a long time. This year, Liu's wife, Liu Li, again sued the Railway Bureau in the Shanghai District Court, requesting a judgment for the Railway Bureau to compensate for losses of approximately 51,600 yuan. After the Railway Bureau entrusted consultant Zhang, a lawyer, to handle the defense, the court ruled that the Bureau should hand over the original collected compensation of 1,233 yuan to settle the case, as previously reported. Liu Li, dissatisfied, appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court. The court, considering the litigation between the two parties as a waste of litigation fees, advised reconciliation and instructed the Railway Bureau to continue raising 767 yuan in compensation to reach a total of 3,000 yuan. Both parties accepted this. Consultant Zhang, a lawyer, also requested that his court appearance fee of 200 yuan be donated to the compensation, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Continued Hearing of the Zhu Baoyuan Estate Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Shunqing Fails to Appear in Court Due to Illness</p>
<p>Discrepancies Found in the Estate Inventory</p>
<p>Following the death of Zhu Baoyuan, owner of Zhenhe Tea Company, his second wife, Zhu Xi, and his two sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing, became involved in a lawsuit in the First Special District Court over the division of the estate. Various hearings and summonses have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan continued the hearing. Zhu Shunqing, suffering from hemoptysis, was unable to appear in court, as evidenced by a prescription provided by his lawyer. Therefore, only the first defendant, Zhu Yanqing, appeared in court. Judge Qiao first inquired about the time of his father's death, then asked whether the estate inventory provided by the plaintiff was accurate, and presented the list for review. After reviewing, Yanqing stated that the amount was not that large. He then reported the property items one by one. Most of them matched the plaintiff's list, but there were also several items with discrepancies in the amount or that were completely absent. In addition, he declared that although the property existed, Zhu Baoyuan had decided to gift it to his two brothers before his death. The court then inquired about the Zhenhe Tea Company's account books. Yanqing replied that all account books from the previous year and the year before had been sent to accountant Xu for auditing. The accountant had already submitted a detailed report along with the account books. This year, because business had not yet concluded, the account books were still needed for daily use and therefore remained in the shop. However, as it had not been settled, the details could not be clearly stated. As for the plaintiff's claim about a handwritten property ledger of his father's, he had never seen it. His father only had a diary recording various properties, which had already been submitted in the previous case. There were no other handwritten records, he said. The plaintiff's lawyer then questioned Yanqing repeatedly about the fact that he had stated Zhenhe's annual turnover was several hundred thousand or over a million, while the declared capital was only twenty thousand. Yanqing replied that in Shanghai, many tea shops had a capital of only thirty to fifty thousand, while their annual turnover was several hundred thousand or millions. This was true not only for tea shops but also for other businesses. The lawyer then presented questions about the shop's business conditions, income and expenses, and personnel changes over the years, questioning the defendant for a long time. By five o'clock, Judge Qiao adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Hou Guohua Accused of Enticing and Raping a Young Girl <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Intending to Abandon Her After Cohabitation</p>
<p>The Defendant Claims the Girl is a Prostitute</p>
<p>Hou Guohua, owner of Hua Kang Woolen Shop, is a native of Ningbo, nearing forty years old. He had been cohabitating with a woman surnamed Qi, appearing as husband and wife. Between the summer and autumn of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he suddenly encountered a woman from the same hometown, Tang Xiuying, and fell in love at first sight. At the time, the girl was only nineteen years old. Not only was she charming and lovely, but she was also waiting to be married in the inner chambers. Hou then</p>
<p>Made Every Effort to Entice Her</p>
<p>Hoping to taste the forbidden fruit. However, Tang's mother, Tang Wang, controlled her very strictly, leaving no opportunity to take advantage. Later, when the girl and her mother went to Shanghai and returned to their hometown, Hou still couldn't forget her. They communicated frequently. Because the girl had been exposed to Shanghai's customs, she was also not accustomed to living in the countryside. Moreover, someone took the opportunity to entice her, and she secretly came to Shanghai without her mother's knowledge. Hou learned of the girl's letter in advance, so he went to the dock to meet her. Upon arrival, they both went to the Oriental Hotel. That evening, Hou showed great concern and care, describing his family history, saying that due to years of managing military uniform business and running north and south, he had accumulated assets of four to five hundred thousand, but he had no time to consider marriage, causing him to grow old without a wife. If she didn't reject him, he would dare to make a lifelong commitment. The naive girl from the countryside, listening to these sweet words, was immediately overjoyed and agreed to his proposal. Hou's goal was achieved, and he took it a step further and</p>
<p>Rented a House for Cohabitation</p>
<p>However, he always perfunctorily evaded Xiuying's urging for marriage, saying he needed to wait for the approval of his elders or that his fate was unfavorable. By last summer, Xiuying was pregnant, and he used the excuse of her large belly being unsightly, saying that he would perform the wedding ceremony after she gave birth. Before long, Xiuying discovered Hou's secret with the woman surnamed Qi, and she realized that Hou was a lecherous rogue who did not want to formally marry her to avoid interference from the Qi woman. So, she wrote to her mother, asking her to come to Shanghai to take charge. After Tang Wang arrived, Hou immediately asked his brother to intercede, promising to sever ties with the Qi woman and to marry her after she gave birth, and he was willing to designate 5,000 yuan as security, guaranteeing that he would not abandon her, and giving another 1,000 yuan as consolation money. The living expenses were set at 120 yuan per month. Tang Wang then accepted these reconciliation conditions, and Hou wrote an agreement as proof. Nearing the end of the year, Xiuying gave birth to a boy. Just as they were holding the birth celebration, Hou suddenly invited Chinese and Western doctors to the house, forcibly examining Xiuying's body. After she refused, Hou hired a lawyer to write a letter, saying that Xiuying was not in a state of giving birth and that the child was obtained from elsewhere to</p>
<p>Pretend it was Her Own Child</p>
<p>It was difficult to acknowledge, and his actions were bizarre. The Tang Wang mother and daughter were at a loss. Hou then invited his brother, the Qi woman, and several lawyers to swarm in, creating a threatening situation, forcing the Tang five mother and daughter to hand over the previously written agreement and the newborn child. At the time, a big conflict broke out, but the results were not taken away. Afterwards, the Tang mother and daughter said that Hou Guohua was bullying women and children, even worse than a rogue, and it was impossible to forgive him anymore. Therefore, they hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, saying that the defendant initially</p>
<p>Disrupted the Family</p>
<p>Enticed and abducted a girl under the age of twenty, taking her away from the guardianship of the person with parental rights, luring her to Shanghai with the intent of sexual intercourse. His actions constitute a crime under Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, he disrupted public morals by using deception to make the girl mistakenly believe that there was a spousal relationship, indulging his animalistic desires. His actions constitute a crime under Article 244, Section 1 of the same law. Finally, he damaged her reputation by publicly insulting her and attempting to abandon her in bad faith, violating his agreement. His actions constitute crimes under Articles 324 and 310 of the same law. He should be severely punished to deter evil and maintain public morals. They also attached a private prosecution, requesting that he be ordered to fulfill the agreement, it was said. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, led by Feng Shide, held a hearing. The defendant claimed that Tang Xiuying was indeed</p>
<p>A Prostitute</p>
<p>Whom he met in a hotel. His remaining words were either evasive or ambiguous. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Feng, considering that this case still required investigation, adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>A Young Apprentice is Arrested for Falling in Love with a Teenage Girl</p>
<p>Xie Zhaohong, from Hunan, runs a small tavern on Lyuban Road in the French Concession. He has a daughter named Xie Fangxiu, who is only fourteen years old. However, Xie's first wife has passed away, and he remarried three years ago. As a result, the stepmother and the daughter from the previous marriage are not compatible. Xie, unable to do anything about it, arranged for Fangxiu to work in a nearby silk factory, staying overnight in the factory, so that the family could be safe. However, Fangxiu, at the age of thirteen, had already blossomed into a graceful young woman, somewhat like a ripe plum. Zhang Zhaohong, a Nanjing native who worked as a clerk in a clock shop next door, was twenty-two years old, a single young man lodging elsewhere. He saw Fangxiu every day, and they became familiar with each other over time, confiding in each other. Since neither was subject to any restraints, they often went out together and fell in love. Who knew that the thirteen-year-old girl, not yet developed, was already pregnant, six months along. Zhang Zhaohong, at a loss, discussed the matter with the girl, and they agreed to run away together to Nanjing. However, Zhang was a small clerk with no money.

<p>The Golden Mouse brand cigarettes produced by the Huacheng Tobacco Company are sold briskly in society and have long enjoyed a reputation. Yesterday, Wang Qingzhang, the owner of Qingfengxiang Tobacco and Paper Store, No. 810 Haining Road, was found to be selling counterfeit Golden Mouse brand cigarettes of Huacheng Tobacco Company. On the 24th of this month, the police discovered this and immediately searched the store, finding 2,100 counterfeit cigarettes. The store owner, Wang Qingzhang, and the counterfeit cigarettes were taken to the Huizi Police Station. On the 25th, they were brought to the Fifth Court of the court for trial. The court sentenced Wang Qingzhang to one month in prison and a fine of $24.20, and the counterfeit cigarettes were confiscated.</p>

<p>Last night, a careless fire broke out in a shack in Hujia Wood Bridge, Zhabei. When thick smoke rose, residents, helping the old and carrying the young, rushed to escape. Coincidentally, Cui Zi, the 28-year-old wife of Song Xiaogouzi, a Public Works Bureau worker from Zhenjiang, was heavily pregnant and lying in bed. She suddenly heard the fire alarm and tried to get up and put on her clothes to see what was happening, but the fire was already raging. Exhausted, she fell. Neighbors helped her escape the danger, but the movement triggered the baby, and she was on the verge of collapse.

<h3 id="e143">Questions and Answers on Ancient Poetry <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>This column is a part of the "Reading Guidance" work and publishes general reading questions. As for research methods for various subjects, because the scope of the questions involved is too large, it is planned to compile introductions to self-study for various subjects separately, which will not be published in this column. Other questions such as reading difficulties and individual questions will be answered separately by letter. However, recent letters from readers have asked to publish more concrete reading questions. In order to have more academic discussions, the department is also willing to publish the questions that are of an academic nature and are needed by general readers after consideration. Here, the department's specially appointed special committee member, Mr. Shen Xinqing, answers several questions about ancient poetry asked by Mr. Liu Qiushi for readers' research. Editor's note.</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I am currently studying poetry, and there are several points that I do not understand, so I am writing to ask.</p>
<p>(1) Does ancient poetry have metrical rules?</p>
<p>(2) How many kinds of changes have there been in ancient poetry from ancient times to the present?</p>
<p>(3) What kind of metrical rules are the standard for ancient poetry?</p>
<p>(4) Is there a limit to the sound and melody of ancient poetry?</p>
<p>Sincerely, Liu Qiushi</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Liu Qiushi</p>
<p>(1) Ancient poetry has the distinction of four-character, five-character, seven-character, and long and short sentences; the Han Yuefu also has three-character ones.</p>
<p>(2) The changes of ancient poetry generally go from four-character to five-character, and from five-character to seven-character. Long and short sentences are changes of seven-character sentences.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the two points mentioned above, there is no so-called standard; however, four-character sentences take the Book of Songs as the ancestor, and its style is the oldest.</p>
<p>(4) The rhythm of ancient poetry is magical and clear, and depends on the individual, without limit. Read more and write more, and you will gradually enter a better state. As for phonology, it is another specialized field of study and cannot be limited to writing poetry.</p>
<p>(Mail Delivery) Mr. Tian Hualong, Nanjing: Please indicate the mailing address for a reply by letter.</p>
<p>(Mail Delivery 2) He Benzhi and Zhou Kaifang, Hankou: Your letter has been received. I am sorry that I cannot answer your questions, because they are outside the scope of this section.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Explanation of "January 28th" <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>Time passes easily, and the terrible "January 28th" has resurfaced before our—we Chinese—eyes! Mr. Wang Rongfu of the Qing Dynasty had three essays titled "Explanation of San Jiu" (Explanation of Three Nines), in which he explained the numbers from one to nine very thoroughly. Based on his theory, I wrote "Explanation of One Two Eight."</p>
<p>In "Explanation of San Jiu I," Mr. Wang said at the beginning, "One is odd, two is even, one and two cannot be counted as a number"; that is, the two characters "one" and "two" are already very empty. He also said, "Nine is the completion of numbers"; then "eight" is not a completed number either. Based on this explanation, how much of the impression of "January 28th" still remains in the minds of people across the country today? Although it seems that it cannot be measured accurately, since these three characters are not completed numbers, then the so-called "January 28th" is probably just a flash in the pan in newspapers, slogans, or oral presentations: The result: I am afraid that it will disappear with the bullet marks and artillery traces of Songhu. Is this not a very sad thing!</p>
<p>Try to break down the three characters "January 28th" again, and take any two characters to add together. Strangely, the result cannot give us a satisfactory answer. For example, adding one and two results in "three". Mr. Wang said: "Three is the completion of numbers". To put it badly, this word "completion" means that the fact has been established, and there is no need to say it again. Adding one and eight results in "nine". Mr. Wang defines this word "nine" as "the end of numbers". He also said: "Nine is an imaginary number". Therefore, the word "nine" is also very empty; and it may even come to an end here. And Mr. Wang also said: "If three cannot be exhausted, then it is about nine to show that it is much more, this is the imaginary number of language." Therefore, no matter whether one and eight or one and two are added together, it always hits a wall, but only becomes an "imaginary number" in language. Then what about adding two and eight? Adding two and eight results in "ten". However, Mr. Wang said, "Accumulating to ten is to return to one," so "ten cannot be counted as a number"; then it is another empty sign. Try adding the three characters "January 28th" together. The result happens to be "eleven". Since "ten" cannot be counted as a number, and "one" cannot be counted as a number, isn't this another big emptiness?</p>
<p>In short, the tricky and weird three characters "January 28th" are calculated back and forth, and they always give you bad luck, with no chance to succeed; then, you might as well say that this is the destiny of the Chinese people. I wonder how the "upper" and "lower" classes of the whole country feel about this?</p>
<h3 id="e148">Silly <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Chunliu</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I have been recognized by most people as being a bit "silly." Although I once spent a night reading half of the Book of Songs in the private school; and when I was eleven years old, the teacher asked me to write a four-rhyme "Fu-De Poem," but I doubled my efforts and wrote eight rhymes. However, because of this, people generally said that I was silly, and Mr. Liu, who taught me the longest, added another word and called me silly.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to "silly," the word "silly" is different from words like "dull" and "stupid" in terms of its meaning, and it has a subtle meaning of its own. Why should I not be a fool?</p>
<p>Thinking about it carefully: Which great inventors in the world do not have a bit of silliness? May I ask, lying well on the ground, seeing an apple fall to the ground, you have to think of the earth's gravity; standing next to a stove, seeing the lid move, you have to think of something about the effect of steam; obviously living in the quite comfortable ancient civilized capital, suddenly thinking that there will be a vacant lot on the other side of the water; to test the induction of radio, tying a copper wire kite and letting it go to the sky, are these inventors silly enough?</p>
<p>Because they are a bit silly, they can firmly stick to their beliefs, and the ideals that are radiated from a certain belief are true ideals. As the Western saying goes, "The ideal is the mother of fact," we can say: "Silliness is the mother of ideals, and thus the grandmother of facts."</p>
<p>Why should I not be a fool? I'm just afraid that I'm not qualified enough to be a fool!</p>
<h3 id="e149">Four Characteristics of the Capital <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>Last year in Wuxi, I remember writing an article called "Four Characteristics," which occupied a corner of this column. That was about the characteristics of Wuxi. Now I feel that Nanjing has more differences from other places, and the capital, which is the capital of the country, must have its own characteristics, so I write four characteristics again:</p>
<p>"Many government offices": The capital is also our national capital. How can the national capital be anything if there are not many government offices? Therefore, our capital has a particularly large number of government offices, especially in the northern part of the city. No matter on the streets or in the alleys, there are government offices everywhere. In terms of political affairs, from the district office straight to the National Government. In terms of party affairs, from the district branch straight to the central party headquarters. In terms of military affairs, from the company straight to the Military Commission. All levels are complete, plus various committees and parallel agencies, which are truly magnificent and extremely solemn. Many schools or printing factories, as long as they are established by the government, must have soldiers or police standing guard at the door.</p>
<p>"Many officials": With many government offices, there are certainly many officials. All political officials, party officials, military officers, etc., from sesame green bean officials to the Chairman of the National Government, members of the Central Committee, or military giants, all levels are complete. Therefore, officials with briefcases under their arms and badges on their chests can be seen everywhere. Especially in front of the Confucius Temple on Sundays, you can simply bump into badge comrades everywhere. The singing girl's book societies and various entertainment venues rely on them to survive, which is truly a great merit.</p>
<p>"Many singing girls": Because there are many officials, there are also many singing girls. These women who sell smiles for a living decorate their appearance neatly one by one to provide entertainment for others every time the evening lights come on. On the surface, it is indeed selling art, but what is the value of just one "art" in China? Therefore, in order to maintain their survival, they have to sell their bodies as well. The old men of the book societies pay them very little, only a few dimes a day, which is not enough for them to pay for a meal, so their lives depend entirely on ordering plays, and those customers, how can they not have other intentions when they come to order your play? Ah! Those fallen and unfortunate women, when I passed by the Qinhuai River and heard their sad melodies squeezed out for a bowl of rice, it will surely arouse my infinite feelings of drama and dismay!</p>
<p>"Many beggars": Because there are many government offices, many officials, and many singing girls, and the result of the lack of production agencies - factories - has created the current situation of many beggars, which is truly a hidden worry for society. Here, no matter in bustling cities or remote alleys, there are beggars everywhere. In recent days, the weather has been severely cold, and a group of old and young beggars with scant clothing are begging from door to door, from morning to dusk, in a continuous stream. The store residents feel that it is very annoying, but if you think about it from the beggars' point of view, the weather is freezing cold, the number of beggars has suddenly increased, and it is difficult to get enough to eat even if you beg all day, which is also very pitiful. I hope that the ruling gentlemen will quickly find a fundamental solution for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Scattered Strings <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>No matter how passionately a smart woman is kissing her lover, she will not say, "I swear to you, I will never love another person."</p>
<p>In the wedding ceremony filled with lights and colors, in addition to the joy and pleasure, the bride's psychology will also bring up the same subtle sense of sorrow.</p>
<p>The most likely outcome of sisters' fate is a "world of difference."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Frozen Corpses on the Road <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Zikang</p>
<p>The freezing wind blew like a sharp blade on the morning road; I pulled up my collar, and shrank</p>
<p>to pass through a remote alley. Beside the alley entrance on the right, many people were gathered, watching the spectacle. Driven by curiosity, I also stepped forward a couple of paces to see what was happening.</p>
<p>It turned out that in the midst of the crowd, an elderly, dying beggar was lying on the ground. On his face, exposed beyond the many layers of rice straw covering his body, his eyes were already tightly shut, but some of his muscles seemed to still be twitching, and every so often, three shallow breaths escaped him. At that moment, a kind-hearted woman came from within the alley, placing some silver ingots and the like beside him, followed by lighting some incense sticks.</p>
<p>I asked a middle-aged man next to me: "Why not send him to the hospital?"</p>
<p>"What hope is there? --He's as good as dead!"</p>
<p>People had already declared him as good as dead; and they had already left some silver ingots and lit incense sticks for him, so what else was there to say? Thus, I was forced to run away wordlessly, carrying my sorrowful heart!</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Unbearable Pain, Listening Intently to Festive Music; Joy Not Yet Satisfied, Hastened Departure Upon Receiving an Urgent Message</p>
<p>Ji Zhi said: Just wait another day or two. Madam Gan smiled and said, according to your brother's wishes:</p>
<p>, he wanted you to return to school long ago, but I said to wait until after today. Ji Zhi casually asked: Why wait until after today? Madam Gan said: The reason is very simple, isn't it to let you attend today's wedding feast? Ji Zhi said: Ah! You</p>
<p>are talking about the happy event across the street. I have no dealings with the Zhao family. Madam Gan said: That's really strange. According to custom, all neighbors should receive an invitation, especially since you know both the bride and groom. They shouldn't have forgotten you. I heard that the Zhao family invited all the neighbors to the left and right, but not our family. Houzhi smiled and said: They are a military family; we shouldn't bother arguing with them. Ji Zhi listened to their casual conversation and felt very uncomfortable in his heart. He deliberately calmed himself and chatted in the backyard for a while before returning to the front. The annoying military music grew louder, followed by a long string of firecrackers and the cheerful cheers of many people, lasting for a full two hours. Ji Zhi was usually too lazy to listen to such sounds, but he didn't understand why he didn't want to hide in the backyard to avoid them, nor did he want to open his books to distract himself. He just sat blankly in the room, listening to the sounds. After about an hour, the boisterous music could still be faintly heard over several walls. From this, he knew that the Zhao and Yang families had many guests. He further imagined how happy Guizhi and Zhao Ziqiang must be, while he was unlucky enough to return to Haidian and hear this happiness. He thought depressively for a long time and couldn't bear it any longer. He finally went to the upper room to talk with his brother and sister-in-law, to escape the sounds. In the evening, as he lay in bed, he thought, I will completely put these irrelevant matters aside. As my brother said, tomorrow I will return to Dahongmen to teach. (231)</p>

<h3 id="e154">Two Important Questions Regarding Crystal Radios <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Have you all noticed two important questions regarding crystal radios? (1) Which crystal is most effective? (2) Why do crystal detectors use crystals?</p>
<p>Regarding the answer to the first question, we have finally made some progress. The crystals we commonly use are roughly lead sulfide (Galena), silicon (Silicon), iron pyrite (Iron Pyrite), and molybdenum (Molybdenum). Recent discoveries suggest that the combination of copper and copper oxide is most effective. In short, until a more effective crystal is discovered, we will tentatively consider the last one as the most complete answer today.</p>
<p>As for the second question, we cannot provide a fully satisfactory explanation at this time; they are all just speculations. According to Dr. W. H. Eccles of England, when current passes through the detector, a thermoelectric effect occurs on the crystal. This electricity itself has a detection effect. The editor of Physical Review, R. E. Goddard, believes this explanation is more reasonable.</p>
<p>However, the general opinion is that crystal detection is entirely based on "surface work." "Surface work" means that when the crystal comes into contact with the metal needle, the electron evaporation on their surfaces is different. The contact point naturally creates different resistances, which gives the crystal a single-transmission property. Therefore, the crystal has the effect of detection.</p>
<h3 id="e155">How to Build a Crystal Radio <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>This crystal radio, when tested in our Songjiang, had excellent results. During the day, it can receive a 100-watt Shanghai station, and at night, a 50-watt station is also very clear. The circuit is shown on the left. Now, the main components are listed below.</p>
<p>CC1 is a 0.0005 microfarad variable capacitor, C2 is a 0.002 microfarad fixed capacitor, D is a fixed crystal, T is an earpiece, A is an antenna, G is a ground wire. The construction of L and L1 is as follows: Use two spiderweb boards, each wound with 60 turns of No. 24 double-cotton covered wire (winding by changing direction every two pins, i.e., alternating two above and two below), with a tap every ten turns, totaling seven taps including both ends. The primary L connects to six tap nails, with its starting end connected to the moving plate of the variable capacitor C, and the tap key connected to the ground wire GC. The fixed plate of C connects to the antenna A1. The secondary L1 connects to five tap nails, with the starting and ending ends connected to the fixed and moving plates of the variable capacitor C1, and the tap key connected to one end of the fixed crystal D. One end of the earpiece T connects to the other end of the fixed crystal, and the other end connects to the moving plate of C1. The bypass capacitor C2 can be connected in parallel across the two terminals of the earpiece. L and L1 are mounted on a movable push-pull frame, which can increase or decrease the distance between the two coils. All components can be mounted on a piece of bakelite. Figure A below shows the top view, and Figure B shows the arrangement on the front of the bakelite. The components used are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Two 0.0005 microfarad variable capacitors</p>
<p>Two 3-inch diameter degree dials</p>
<p>Two spiderweb boards</p>
<p>One push-pull coil frame (with knob)</p>
<p>Eleven tap nails</p>
<p>Two tap keys</p>
<p>One set of fixed crystal with holder</p>
<p>One 0.002 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>One earpiece</p>
<p>Approximately 35 yards of No. 24 double-cotton covered wire</p>
<p>Four binding posts</p>
<p>One piece each of bakelite and wooden base</p>
<p>Antenna and ground wire and insulators, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Troubleshooting and Repair of Crystal Radios Jiancun <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Since crystal radios are simple in construction and use few components, the occurrence of their faults is not as complicated as that of vacuum tube radios. Moreover, the causes of their faults are also easy to find. Once the source of the problem is clear, the repair method is as easy as turning one's hand. Here, the common problems of crystal radios, their sources, and their repair methods are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>(1) The sound gradually becomes faint: This common problem has four sources:</p>
<p>(1) The sensitivity of the crystal detector is reduced: Although there are various methods for testing the quality of a crystal, if you want to test whether the sensitivity of the original crystal is reduced, simply replace it with a new crystal with higher sensitivity to test. Replacing the new crystal and testing it can solve the problem. If the sound is still gradually faint after testing with a new crystal, then the source of the problem is not in the crystal detector. If the sound is loud, then the source of the problem must be in the crystal.</p>
<p>(2) The sensitivity of the earpiece is reduced: This problem is often caused by the weakening of the magnet inside the earpiece and the poor insulation of the earpiece wiring.</p>
<p>(Detection method) Replace the earpiece to test it and remove the earpiece to test its insulation.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Remove the magnet to strengthen it, but this remedy is not easy for ordinary people to implement. You can take it to a repair company and ask them to repair it.</p>
<p>(3) The operation of the coil suddenly becomes poor: The sensitivity decreases due to humidity, etc.</p>
<p>(Detection method) Remove the suspicious coil and replace it with a new coil to test it.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Dry it in the sun.</p>
<p>(4) The sensitivity of the variable capacitor is reduced: The insulation is poor due to dust, humidity, etc.</p>
<p>(Detection method) Replace the capacitor to test it.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Remove the dust and dry it.</p>
<p>(2) The sound suddenly becomes faint:</p>
<p>(1) The sensitivity of the crystal detector suddenly decreases: When the crystal is hit too hard, or when it is electrically shocked by lightning, its sensitivity suddenly decreases.</p>
<p>(Detection method) Compare it with a new crystal.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Replace it with one that is more sensitive.</p>
<p>(2) The antenna touches trees or other objects, or the wire is broken: (Detection method) Investigate whether the antenna is touching trees or other objects, or whether the wire is broken.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Repair the short circuit and broken wire in the antenna.</p>
<p>(3) The ground wire is broken:</p>
<p>(Detection method) Investigate the ground wire, or temporarily make another ground connection to test it.</p>
<p>(Remedy) Connect the broken part of the wire.</p>

<p>— Wei Xinsu</p>
<p>An ideal crystal radio must have the largest possible volume and sharp selectivity. The circuit in the attached diagram is not far from meeting the above conditions. If this circuit is installed in a place in this city where broadcasting stations are densely packed, it can truly reveal its characteristic of sharp selectivity, without weakening the volume. Sitting in a chair, placing the earpiece of this crystal radio on a desk, we can still hear its sound from afar.</p>
<p>In the diagram, L1 is a honeycomb coil. The primary is wound with 80 turns of No. 28 enameled wire on a 4-inch diameter cylinder. The secondary is wound with the same wire and number of turns on a 2-inch diameter cylinder. L2 is wound with 90 turns of No. 24 enameled wire on a 3-inch diameter cylinder, with a tap drawn from its center to connect to the crystal. L3 is wound with 48 turns of No. 28 enameled wire on a 1-inch diameter cylinder. This coil is related to the selectivity of the entire machine. It is best to pull out several taps for adjustment. C1 and C2 are two 0.00035 mf variable capacitors. These two capacitors can also be coaxial. C3 is a 0.001 mf variable capacitor, which is used to adjust the antenna.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Homemade Crystal Method <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>Crystals can be homemade, the method is very simple, and the effectiveness of the manufactured crystals is also good. The method is as follows: Take a small amount of sulfur and lead, with a weight ratio of about six parts lead to one part sulfur, mix them thoroughly, and place them in a dry test tube, and then plug it to isolate it from the outside air. Then heat the sulfur and lead with an alcohol lamp or charcoal stove, and after the reaction is complete, let it cool, and then find a way to take it out of the test tube. The product manufactured in this way can be used for crystal detection. If you want to make the effect even better, you can put this manufactured product in a high-temperature-resistant container, such as a hard test tube or porcelain, and then plug it to isolate it from the outside air. Then heat it on a gas lamp or a fierce charcoal fire to liquefy it, and then cool it, and you will get a very good crystal. This is the artificial galena.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Substitutes for Crystal Cups and Crystal Installation Methods <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Crystal cups can be replaced by the tin lid on ordinary toothpaste tubes, or the small dish on the back of a hunter's bullet cartridge that holds the primer.</p>
<p>When the crystal is installed in this substitute crystal cup, first clean the inside, and then pour in melted tin, and then fix the crystal with pliers in the tin. Another wire is passed through the tin to facilitate wiring. In this way, the contact surface of the crystal is very large, which can increase its effectiveness, and it is also easier to install in the circuit.</p>

Chen Jianbei presided, Yang Bingxun recorded, and papers were read according to the agenda. First, Chen Lijiang read the paper "Comparative Experiments on Left-Handed Writing Ability at Various Ages," presenting the main points of the already printed paper, reporting the 22 experiments conducted, and the comparison of intelligence tests of children and adults aged 7 to 48 from elementary school to university. Then, Yang Lianggong read the paper "Research on Education Bureau Chiefs" and gave a summary report, saying that education bureau chiefs are responsible for the educational administration of the entire county, and also bear a great mission for the future cultural revitalization of the locality. Therefore, the qualifications, experience, treatment, powers, etc. of the chiefs must be studied, and a brief report was made on the results of the investigation conducted in six provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Hebei. The highest treatment was (Jiangsu) 120 yuan, and the lowest was in Hebei, with one county only 12 yuan. Then, Xu Benzhen, representing Tao Zhixing, read the paper "Urgent Implementation Plan for Popular Education in China." After the papers were read, the proposals were discussed. First, the chairman reported that there were too many proposals today and the time was limited. After Yang Lianggong, Liu Tingfang, and others expressed their opinions separately, it was decided that proposals submitted by attendees would be discussed first. Then, the resolutions were discussed and decided as follows: (1) The new standards for the elementary and secondary school curriculum promulgated by the Ministry were submitted for research, and a committee was organized to conduct group research. The results will be reported at the next annual meeting (passed).</p>
<p>(Nanjing Electric News, 26th) At the second annual meeting of the Chinese Education Society, Chairman Chen Jianxiu resolved in the morning (1) to request the central government to stipulate the percentage of central and local education in the total expenditure, (2) to jointly study the methods of the joint examination with the Chinese Testing Society.

In the evening, the Ministry of Education and the Beijing Municipal Government publicly hosted all members in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education. Tomorrow noon, Wang Luyi, a public official of the Central Ministry and Party, will publicly host all members.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Details of the First Day of the Conference <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The second annual meeting of the Chinese Education Society, after holding the opening ceremony at the gymnasium of Central University on the morning of the 25th, the Nanjing elementary and secondary schools and social education institutions and the Nanjing branch hosted all members at the Central Hotel at noon. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting was held in Classroom 109 on the ground floor of the South High School, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Zheng Xiaocang, Wu Nanxuan, Shen Tilan, Wang Muzun, Xiao Xiaorong, Zhang Ying, Fang Wanbang, Yi Bojian, and others, totaling more than sixty people including the previous attendees, continued to arrive on that day. Faculty and staff from Xiamen University, Central University, and Anhui Xuancheng Middle School attended the meeting to listen. First, Chairman Zhuang Zexuan reported and read the papers. In addition to the three papers scheduled on the agenda, there was also an English paper brought by the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the morning. Mr. Liu Tingfang was asked to read it first (limited to ten minutes per person). Mr. Liu then read the English paper from Beijing, "Dr. Mareke's Danish Folk High Schools," and added an explanation. He first said that since the change in the farmer-tenant system in Denmark, there have been 1,500 cooperatives, so the Danish countryside is almost surrounded by cooperatives. Ninety percent of all cattle and seventy-six percent of pigs are registered. Then, he summarized the situation of the Danish education system and national development, and the process of implementing popular education. Chairman Zhuang said that the paper given to us by Dr. Mareke in a hurry will be thanked by the board of directors in the future. Then, Tong Runzhi read the paper "General Situation of Junior Middle Schools in China and the Implementation of the Curriculum." The original text has been printed into a thick volume, and Mr. Tong summarized the report. Then, the chairman reported that Pan Wenan was absent due to business, and his paper "Vocational Education and National Defense" has been requested to be read by his representative Chen Zunshan. Then, Mr. Chen presented the main points of the paper: (1) Factories must be transformed, (2) Talents must be cultivated, (3) Resources must be developed, (4) Rural revitalization must be sought. Then, Zheng Tonghe, representing Cheng Langxi, read the paper "Research on the Chinese Academy System." Mr. Zheng briefly stated that the main points of the paper include (1) the origin of the academy, (2) the Song Dynasty academy, (3) the Yuan Dynasty academy, (4) the Ming Dynasty academy, (5) the Qing Dynasty academy, (6) the abolition of the academy. He also connected and said that the academy first had this term in the Tang Dynasty, but at that time it was a library nature, not teaching students. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, because scholars generally felt that books were lacking, they had to go to the library-like academy to read books, and the academy's cause was more advanced than before, but it was not yet public. It was gradually made public until the Song Dynasty, with four major academies lecturing. At that time, attention was paid to metaphysics. When the Mongols entered and ruled China during the Yuan Dynasty, the academy system was even better than the Song Dynasty, and attention was also paid to metaphysics. In the early Ming Dynasty, it did not receive much attention, and then it was revived by Wang Yangming's lectures. In the Qing Dynasty, even more special attention was paid to the academy, and academies were established in various provinces, prefectures, and counties. Students who were admitted also received subsidies, which were divided into three types: children, students, and special students. The oldest was over seventy years old, and the youngest was nine years old, with a wide difference. At that time, they were roughly divided into metaphysics, imperial examination, essays, and rhetoric. It was a very prosperous time. During the time of Wei Zhongxian, the academy was destroyed. It was not restored until Wei's death. Until the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, after the Sino-Japanese War, due to the comparison between China and foreign countries, it was felt that it was not suitable for the needs. Therefore, schools were changed in the 29th year of Guangxu, and the academy system was abolished. Then, the chairman reported that the reading of the papers had been completed, and it was time to start discussing the methods for carrying out the research work of the society, and reported that the board of directors had decided yesterday to submit to the conference the "Plan for Carrying Out the Research Work of the Society," in which the following special topics were proposed: (1) the issue of teacher training, (2) the issue of the realization of compulsory education, (3) the organization and powers of the Education Bureau, (4) the pros and cons of the examination system, (5) the difficulties in the implementation of the new curriculum standards for elementary and secondary schools, (6) the direction and curriculum of university education departments, (7) the nature of people's schools, (8) the implementation of productive education, (9) the review of children's books. Please discuss. Zheng Xiaocang, Ou Yuanhuai, Liu Tingfang, Shao Shulong, and other members all expressed their opinions. First, according to the method of the "Plan for Carrying Out the Research Work of the Society" submitted to the society by the board of directors yesterday, ((1) The annual meeting will decide on research topics, and a committee will be appointed to be responsible for carrying out the research, and each branch will be asked to assist, (2) Introduce educational institutions for experimental research, (3) Solicit individual research from each member)), was passed one by one. Then, the members proposed seven more special topics, adding up to sixteen topics with the nine topics proposed by the board of directors. Then, after the nine topics, (10) the issue of the central thought of Chinese education, (11) rural education, (12) education and national defense, (13) the policy of studying abroad, (14) the future of graduates and further education, (15) civic education, (16) research issues such as character education were added, and it was decided among the sixteen topics that the next annual meeting would focus on the following three issues: (1) the issue of teacher training, (2) the direction and curriculum of university education departments, (3) the implementation of productive education. The remaining topics will be studied as a supplement, depending on the time and personal interests, but they are not specified. Those who are deemed to be central, continue to report the congratulatory telegram from the Beiping branch and the screening of the film by the Ministry of Education in the evening. The Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government will publicly host a banquet tomorrow, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order yesterday to the registered private primary and secondary schools in this city, stating that the school opening and closing dates have long been clearly stipulated in the school calendar. However, most private schools act independently, arbitrarily suspending classes and taking vacations, which is a deliberate violation of regulations and a disregard for education. If any school continues to fail to comply with the school calendar in the future, the Bureau will revoke its registration as a warning upon verification. Furthermore, the starting date for the second semester of the 22nd year is February 1st. Primary schools will begin classes on the 3rd of the same month, and middle schools will begin classes on the 5th. All of this is clearly stated in the Bureau's Education Weekly No. 202 and has already been communicated for compliance. All schools should comply and not mislead themselves or others.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order yesterday to municipal and private registered secondary schools, stating that the Bureau has revised the format of student transfer certificates for secondary schools in this city and the method for issuing them, and previously issued a clear order for everyone to comply. Subsequently, the Affiliated Middle School of Guanghua University submitted a report stating that since the format of the transfer certificate has been stipulated by the Bureau, but the thickness of the paper varies, making it difficult to maintain uniformity, they propose that the Bureau print them on their behalf and that schools purchase them from the Bureau when needed. They also propose that all schools in the city use this format starting from the second semester of the 22nd year to facilitate inspection. They request that the Bureau review and implement this proposal. Based on this, the Bureau finds that the proposed opinions are feasible and should be adopted. The Bureau has now printed and bound the transfer certificates into booklets, each containing one hundred pages, priced at seven dimes per booklet. Schools should prepare a letter with payment and purchase them from the Accounting Division of the Bureau starting from the 29th of this month. From now on, all schools should comply with the previous and current orders when issuing these transfer certificates and follow the specified procedures, except that stamps are not required. Please be informed of this order.</p>

<p>Chang Hua 59, Brave 20</p>
<p>Pirates 43, Eagles 24</p>
<p>Three First Division Matches Tonight</p>
<p>The First Division of the Shanghai Basketball Association began last night, and the China Basketball House will gradually become lively. Most of the players who represented Shanghai at last year's National Games have joined under the name of Chang Hua, which is noteworthy. In their first test, they defeated Brave (i.e., the West YMCA Daredevils) by a score of 59 to 20. The Eagles recruited players from the Allied Team in the West YMCA basketball league and strongly resisted the Pirates, but ultimately could not avoid defeat. As a result, the Pirates won 43 to 24. In the three Second Division matches, New Light forfeited, so Youai won without a fight. Nan Shang defeated Tu Jin, 34 to 19. Fei Fei defeated Jian Le, 38 to 33. There are three First Division matches tonight, and the situation is very interesting. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Competing Teams　Division　Time　Referee</p>
<p>Philippine Team vs. All Blacks　Second Division One　5:30 PM　Shi Zhaokang</p>
<p>Vatican vs. Zhen Ru　First Division One　6:30 PM　Lü Changfu</p>

<p>The Pirates team recently won the West YMCA First Division Championship, and their spirit is booming. The Eagles, in addition to their original veterans, have the services of the Xia brothers, Lin Zequn, and Chen Wenkui, who represented the Allied Team in the West YMCA League, and their strength is very strong. During the competition, Xu Mingyang and Chen Wenkui, two forwards, were still powerful, and with free throws and shots, they first forced the Pirates to 3-0. In a short time, Rhein of the Pirates returned the favor with three points. Xia Zeren then boldly made long shots and oblique shots, adding four points and moving forward again. Carson and Delou of the other side were unwilling to show weakness and reenacted a 7-7 tie. Later, Lin and Carl, Carl and Chen, rose and increased, and again became an 11-11 third tie. This was the peak of the Eagles' game yesterday. After that, the Pirates fled east and west, becoming more rampant. Although the Eagles resisted calmly, there was no chance to face each other again, and the situation deteriorated. The Pirates led 19-12 in the first half, and the final result was 43-24, with the Pirates winning.</p>

<p>The Chang Hua team is organized by the Chang Hua woolen mill, and most of the fighters come from Yangshupu, with extremely strong strength. Their opponent, Brave, is the West YMCA's</p>
<p>B team, with profound tactics. The two armies clashed at 8:30, and within ten minutes, they were evenly matched, once reaching a 4-4 tie. After entering, Chang Hua's original skills gradually revealed, becoming tighter and tighter, while the group of blue-eyed children became softer and softer, eventually becoming a complete failure. The first half was 24-13, with Chang Hua leading. As a result, Chang Hua won by a large margin of 59-20.</p>

<p>Three Second Division matches, one forfeited, namely New Light in Second Division Two forfeiting to Youai. The other two matches were interesting.</p>
<p>The Nan Shang team, a disguised version of the Second Division champion Xinyang, had the qualifications of a First Division team. Yesterday's battle with Tu Jin was like taking something out of a bag, but they could not avoid being too confident and slightly underestimating their opponent. However, Tu Jin's technique was indeed not weak. One side was casual, and the other side worked doubly hard. Therefore, in the first half, Tu Jin led 11-9. In the second half, Nan Shang worked hard and finally turned defeat into victory with a score of 34-19. In another match, Fei Fei vs. Jian Le, the situation was tense, and the performance was still worth watching. In the first half, Jian Le was far ahead with a score of 22-15, but in the second half, Fei Fei created a 38-35 victory. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>

<p>Silver Price and Exchange Rate Continue to Fall and Then Rise Eight Yuan and Four Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday. The situation throughout the day was quite volatile, but the underlying trend was strong, and the outlook is still the same. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both fell, and the deferred silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by 4 to 5%. The exchange rate continued to narrow. London gold fell by nine pence, US cotton was unchanged, stocks fell slightly, and US wheat fell by 1.375 points. The wool market opened and rose to 13 yuan, and major players entered the market, pushing the price closer to the 20 yuan mark. After the opening, the situation seemed tired due to banks' appetite becoming congested, but the price fluctuated. When Sassoon came to supply US dollars, the exchange market hardened and fell, but banks took the opportunity to buy at low prices and the price rose again. Foreign telegrams reported slight purchases of silver. The Guangbang sold contracts, and the lower reaches were active. Later, because the banks' appetite was stagnant, the price fluctuated again. When the banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply, the dealers sought to close their positions but failed, and the gold market strengthened for a while. It was rumored in the market that the US silver market had reported a significant drop in the night market. However, a Reuters telegram from Washington brought news of the Senate's debate on the currency bill, which had little impact, but people thought it was unfavorable, and the exchange market remained loose. At noon, it was still declining. The later market was initially flat and then firm, which was due to the dealers continuing to close their positions and the banks' appetite occasionally appearing stagnant. Major players such as Dachangxiang have now gone long by more than 1,000 taels, Qianchangxiang has added more than 1,000 taels, Yuan Maoyong covered short positions by 1,000 taels, while Hengyu added short positions. The "cooked red" price was 1,100 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 3 pence, 9375 for the British exchange and 33.9375 yuan for the US exchange. Mitsui sold April US dollars at 3.75, Yuan Maoyong and Yongfeng sold, falling to 6.5 yuan. It was expected that HSBC would list the British exchange at a reduction of 125 and the US exchange at a reduction of 375. Qianchangxiang, Dafa Yong, and others came in, rising to 7.8 yuan. After entering, Mitsui bought February US dollars at 125 and sold April at 375. The gold market situation was uncertain. Later, the banks' appetite became congested, and Sassoon also sold. The US dollar domestic market hardened. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Yiyu, Dakang, Hengtai, Yida, Yongfu Yu, and others sold contracts one after another, falling to 4.2 yuan. Dafa Yong, Hengyu, Yuanchang Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuan Maoyong, and others took the opportunity to buy at low prices. April US dollars were difficult to close at half a yuan, and the price rose to 6.8 yuan. McGill still sold April US dollars at 4.375 and May at 5.625. The situation continued to deteriorate. Later, Tianfeng, Qianchangxiang, Shengda Shunli, Yida Yong, and others came to sell contracts, and the news was unfavorable, retreating to within 5 yuan. However, there were quite a few people taking the opportunity to cover at low prices, and people's hearts were uncertain. Zhengjin bought April US dollars at half a yuan, and February at 1.75. Yuankangxiang and Yuan Maoyong Zhentai handed in contracts one after another, and the price rose to 7.1 yuan. However, this price was difficult to sell. The Dalian gang limited the market to sell but failed, and the price fell. Daxing Yong, Hengyu, and Guangbang successively unloaded their hands. Wahbi sold April US dollars at 4.375, HSBC sold May at 625, and then retreated to 4.1 yuan. Yuan Maoyong and Zhengchang entered contracts, and the price rose again to 5.4 yuan.

<p>US dollars at half a yuan and bought June at 8.125. The upper market was stable. Mitsui ate May US dollars at 625, and Fuyu Shenkang entered contracts, rising from 4.3 yuan to over 5 yuan. After entering, Tianfeng Hongli, Yuan Maoyong, Daxing Yong, and Ruixing jointly entered contracts, and the price rose to 6.8 yuan. Hengyu unloaded, retreating slightly by 9 jiao, but because Zhengjin Mitsui bought March US dollars at 3.125, Zhifeng Yong, Hengyu Daxing Yong, Ruixing, etc. entered again, Mitsui handed in June US dollars at 75, and the price rose to 7.8 yuan. Mitsui came out March US dollars at 25, Dafa Yong Hengxing, Chunyuan Yong, and Yuanheng came to sell, falling to within 7 yuan. Shengda also came out, at 6.1 yuan. After entering, Bingxing and others all entered, but because Dafa Yong was still selling, the market fluctuated. When Pan Gen ate May US dollars at 5.625, Hengyu Daxing Yong entered to over 7 yuan, Hengxing also bought, at 8 yuan, and the closing price was 717.9 yuan.

The price of goods was snapped up at 7.2 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 718.5 yuan and the lowest price was 714 yuan, with a difference of 4.5 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by 8.4 yuan from the previous close.</p>

The "cooked red" price was 1,100 yuan. The central government's appetite was quite strong, which led to</p>
<p>a strong situation. The official transactions in the market ranged from 1,201 yuan to 1,106 yuan, sold by the Tianjin gang to Yingfeng Heng and others, totaling about 1,000 taels. Swap transactions were still quiet. This month's contracts have 1,561 contracts remaining, and February has a total of 6,489 contracts.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Bond and Securities Market Trends are Promising <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Generally, prices are up by ten to twenty cents to about one dollar.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's January futures trading ceased. The market is only trading February futures for one month. March futures are permitted to start trading on the 30th. January futures settlements will be processed on the 29th. There have been no environmental changes recently, and the market sentiment remains very strong. When trading opened in the morning, the atmosphere was sluggish, and trading was extremely light. Market prices also showed no movement. Although No. 46 was still being sold, the quantities were limited, so transactions were also very few. Prices fluctuated by only ten to twenty cents. The situation was similar in the second session, with the overall trend weaker by ten to twenty cents, and trading remained very sparse. Trading was slightly more active in the afternoon. Many retail investors bought in the first session, but major players continued to sell. Market prices were slightly firmer, with more gains than losses. At the close, No. 46 was still being sold, while No. 32 was being sold even more vigorously. Market prices gradually rose. Gold, short-term bonds, and consolidated sixes were all up by sixty to seventy cents. No. 96 also rose to eight yuan. Most bonds saw new highs again, and the trend is extremely favorable, with the possibility of further gains. However, the sellers in the market are mainly major players, while the buyers are mostly retail investors, which carries some inherent risks. As a result, market prices, except for the 1929 Customs Loan, which fell slightly by five cents due to the heavy selling of No. 77, rose by ten to twenty cents to about one dollar. The total transaction volume was 6,172,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot transactions, 2,345,000 yuan in futures for consolidated salt tax, 620,000 yuan in demobilization bonds, 380,000 yuan in 1929 Customs Improvement Loan, 800,000 yuan in 20-year consolidated Customs Loan, 1,045,000 yuan in gold short-term consolidated sixes, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand.</p>
<h3 id="e188">New York Stock Market Experiences a Minor Correction <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>A report from the New Fung Trading Company on the 25th stated that the New York stock market first weakened due to some profit-taking by the bulls. This was natural, as the market had risen almost continuously for ten days. Some short-selling appeared in the market, but the trend later reversed. Auto stocks were the first to rebound. The results were mixed. Wall Street believes that the stock market's foundation remains solid and expects the public to continue participating. U.S. government bonds were stable, while corporate bonds were slightly softer. The total daily trading volume was 2.27 million shares. The weather for "Wheat" is warmer, and old bulls are taking profits, leading to a drop of more than one cent. The market is expected to continue to decline. The "Cotton" restriction on ginning may not succeed, so Punk Hae's mandatory legislation may pass in Congress. The market rebounded from a low, but buying was weak, and bulls are likely to continue taking profits. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, resulting in a flat trend. Due to unfavorable news, foreign yarn is being heavily dumped in the Yangtze River basin at especially low prices. This has dampened market sentiment, but some are taking long positions because the base of local yarn has already dried up. However, the overall environment remains unfavorable.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Man-Made Cotton Slightly Mixed <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The man-made cotton market opened with stronger buying interest due to rising raw cotton prices, with prices for each month up by one, two, three, and four cents.

<p>The cotton market remains tight, and the upward trend is intensifying due to declining exchange rates, rising gold prices, and stable U.S. cotton prices. This has boosted market sentiment, with retail investors covering short positions. Since this month is the last day and there are too many short positions without goods, the market has continued to rise. Fortunately, Yuanda's bull positions are being closed in large quantities at market prices, which has somewhat flattened the upward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Zheng Cotton Up by Two Cents <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>

<h3 id="e196">New Standards for Yarn Futures Under Preparation <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The standard yarn of the Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been the 16-count Ren Zhong yarn since it began trading on July 1, 1921. At the same time, Japanese yarn could also be used for delivery. After the May 30th Incident in 1925, the grading of Japanese yarn was removed, and only Chinese yarn was used as the standard. 10-count coarse yarn and 20-count fine yarn were both added for delivery. In 1929, the Indian merchant Qiao Zhifu, a speculator, organized a bull company, purchasing 60,000 bales of March standard yarn and vigorously squeezing the shorts, resulting in a major upheaval. Many sellers found the rapid price increases unsustainable, leading to significant losses and bankruptcies. The highest price reached 183 taels (at that time, the price was quoted in Shanghai 98-regulation yuan). As a result, the shorts lost a total of 2 million taels. Having suffered this major disaster, yarn merchants requested a revision of the standard scope, adopting a broader approach that included all Chinese yarn factories nationwide in the grading system. Yarn produced by factories in Hankou, Tianjin, Wuxi, Changzhou, Taicang, Nantong, and other places was included in the grading table. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident the year before last, Shanghai factories suspended operations for three months, and the exchange also suspended trading. With the evolution of the times, the 20-count fine yarn Ren Zhong was changed to the standard, which was an evolution in the history of standards. Subsequently, on October 16th of last year, the National Economic Committee established the Cotton Industry Control Association, which first attempted to maintain yarn prices. However, this has not been effective, primarily because of rural bankruptcy, financial exhaustion, sluggish yarn sales, and increasing inventories. Coupled with the global cotton industry's slump, market prices have been difficult to stabilize. According to rumors in the market, a certain large factory has been continuously delivering yarn into the exchange's warehouses, with over 20,000 bales of yarn such as Dragon Boat, Caihua, and Ren Zhong. The quality of this cotton yarn is relatively poor, which has depressed market prices. As a result, there have been calls for reform of the standard brand, and the May and June standard yarn futures have been suspended from trading. It is also said that a meeting was held on the 8th of this month to discuss changing the standard to 20-count Golden Chicken yarn. However, some brokers opposed this, so it has not been officially announced and implemented. Further investigation will be conducted and reported.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Food Grains Wheat Flour Bulls Return This Month to Maintain Prices <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month presented a flat and weak appearance.</p>
<p>Due to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down four or five cents, and Canada was down about two cents, so after the opening, both near-term and deferred-term sentiment was not good. The current month, with delivery approaching, saw some floating bulls eager to exit, and the market air was quite loose, falling as low as one cent and four points. Deferred terms also fell simultaneously. Later, as the bulls pulled in, it rebounded slightly. When the afternoon market opened, each month was still not good, but the bulls in the current month maintained the market because of the market's decline, gradually taking in a considerable quantity, which brought up the market sentiment, resulting in a substantial rebound compared to the morning's lowest market. As a result, the current month was up five li compared to the previous day, February-March was up one cent and two and a half li, April-May was up seven and a half li, and June was up five li.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Futures Wheat Trading is Very Quiet <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market generally presented a flat and weak appearance. Because foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down four or five cents, and Canada was down two cents, trading was still dull in each month after the opening. There were few entries and exits, but in the current month, due to the approaching delivery, those unwilling to take delivery exited one after another, and the market air trended unstable. Since buying and selling in deferred terms were quiet, there was little up and down. As a result, the current month was down three cents compared to the previous day, March-June was down two cents, and there was no comparison for the rest. Current wheat is still firm, but there are not many chips and little delivery. Jikai Mingguang wheat was at four yuan, for a total of 500 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the custom xian rice market situation, the Fujian appetite is still greedy, but in recent days, goods in transit have gradually arrived at port, and there are even more sources from Jiangxi.

Recently, after the local authorities in the province controlled food, they estimated that there was a surplus of more than 2.7 million shi, and they are now planning to continuously ship and sell it to other provinces. Recently, arrivals in the Shen area have gradually increased, so at the same time as brisk transactions in Fujian Province, the market has been unable to soar. The street and the Zhejiang gang also went to the market to purchase because the market was flat due to more arrivals. Throughout the day, Fujian Province purchased 2,800 bags of various xian rice, with Jiangxi machine late accounting for 45%. The street purchased 600 bags of various rice, and the Zhejiang gang purchased more than 300 bags. Xian rice market prices were the same as the previous market, but high-quality machine yuan rice was lacking, and there were also few arrivals from Hexia. Therefore, yesterday, the Fujian gang purchased Wuxi train machine yuan rice at a price of 8.40 yuan, which was several cents higher than the previous day. Jiangxi Yinhua glutinous rice was still priced at 6.50 yuan, but it was also brought up.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 60 ships from various gangs in Hexia arrived, totaling more than 8,000 shi, with late rice still accounting for more than 20 ships. Custom gangs' appetites remained as strong as before, with both North and South Ocean gangs continuing to buy more than 2,000 bags. Therefore, the price of Qingjiao, Songsi, and other late rice fell by five cents. The thick geng of each gang was still difficult to establish due to the store appetite being still sluggish, and the market situation was difficult to stabilize. Prices continued to fall by several cents. Qingjiao, Yangdu, and Yangjian arrivals and sales were similar, and there was no honor or disgrace in the market. Arrivals of Yinyuan were slightly scarce, so the market color was still able to stabilize. Bianyuan was still firm.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 10 ships of goods arrived from various roads in Hexia. The market was dull, and the price of bao appetite was reduced. The market shape was that the price of Bai Geng Bai Yuan fell by one cent, and the price of Yangbu Jian fell by several points. The rare Dujian goods stood tall. Early thin rice Yinyuan custom jian stabilized.</p>

<p>— Yuan Gu</p>
<p>It is said that Eastern and Western cultures are getting closer day by day, which is a gratifying thing. This should be attributed to the steamships, trains, airplanes, and the like invented by foreign devils! As well as the Suez Canal they opened and the Siberian Railway they built. We, with the demeanor of a great nation, the style of an emperor, and the temper of a young master, are taking them all for our enjoyment. What a cause for celebration!</p>
<p>But in culture, we are also broad-minded to the point of indifference! The Japanese have appropriated our writing, the Americans have learned mahjong, and it is said that the French have even learned our cooking. Recently, the Haikyunberg Circus, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, also has people from our country wielding guns and performing. Our culture will soon assimilate the world! What a cause for celebration! But, it’s all up to them!</p>
<p>Let's talk about a "master" in our country who is greatly admired by foreigners. He brought a large batch of paintings, including works by Wu Changshuo, Chen Shizeng, Zhao Zhiqian, and others, to conquer the German art scene. This person had traveled abroad twice, learned that kind of oily tongue, and returned to submit a memorial to the Ministry of Education, which is truly a masterpiece even more lasting than his works of art. Among them, he stated that Europeans worshipped his works without exception, truly placing him high in the heavens! And the great and small artists of Europe in the past all wished they could dig themselves out of the ground to marvel at his works. Perhaps it is the inevitable nature of officials praising each other! But we don't care about it. Even if this person's art conquers the whole world! But here we want to ask, these paintings of modern Easterners have been "sent to see," and perhaps a few have been sold. But are there any paintings by great modern German writers that have been "brought to see"? In principle, the German Ministry of Education should promptly dispatch officials to take many famous paintings from the museum and send them to Shanghai for an exhibition to thank them for this respect. But this, according to people who know the situation of German art, is absolutely impossible for the Germans.</p>
<p>In fact, this is also a matter of no great importance. Eastern and Western art are absolutely incompatible. The two cultures may be close in a thousand years. But we will always offer ourselves, to be enjoyed, used, and pleased by the strong. Just as why agricultural nations make many dried vegetables and store dried fish and meat to guard against nomadic peoples coming and plundering everything, leaving them with no food. At this time, although Germany is in turmoil, it is still a time of "people's well-being and abundant resources," enough to "attract" Eastern art, like the Han Dynasty's "attraction" of ostriches and grapes. And a few rascals, after selling themselves into poverty and becoming destitute, want to obtain approval because of the little things hidden in their homes. The weaker a nation becomes, the more "ingenious" the things it does, and the closer it gets to extinction! If it continues to be "ingenious," it will reach the point where there is no need to "send to see." At that time, there will probably be no art at all.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Current State of the Literary World <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yuan</p>
<p>This era is somewhat unique: not only are there many strange political phenomena, but also in the literary world, all kinds of monstrous and demonic things emerge endlessly.</p>
<p>Just as the great officials and gentlemen use petty sycophants as a stepping stone to advancement, so too do writers and scholars shout and clamor, using their fellow travelers as stepping stones to climb upwards. When they are shouting and clamoring, they conceal their inherent flaws – especially past shortcomings – in order to win the sympathy of readers.</p>
<p>When they are seeking sympathy and trying to win over the masses, they are passionate, progressive, and appear on the literary scene with a brand-new face. They attack everything old; they want to destroy and demolish the old foundations and create a new one; they are exhibiting</p>
<p>the fearless spirit of a revolutionary.</p>
<p>All of this is the same as a newly emerged political commentator.</p>
<p>They are noticed by the masses and loved by the reading public; even the old forces regard them as leaders and representatives of the new generation and secretly send them "autumn waves" of flirtation.</p>
<p>At this time, they have an unshakeable position in society, and they no longer need the support of young people. Their influence extends into the circles of the old forces. They become members of the old forces; the old forces welcome the newly joined powerful elements; and they are also eager to support everything old – they want to climb higher, stepping on a different kind of ladder.</p>
<p>They completely become another kind of person, completely revealing their original hideous face; they no longer shout, they no longer clamor, and instead regard the passionate shouts of others as disturbing their peaceful life. They know all the secrets of the old and new literary worlds; they know how to cater to the old forces in order to create a new position for themselves; at the same time, they also know how to lure later arrivals and how to deceive their eyes and ears. They are "those who have been there"; even more terrifying than all the old forces, they are "those who have been there" who can lead a group of blind young people down a dead end.</p>
<p>Their boldness, their ability to flatter, their ability to create their own new positions, and even their shamelessness, are all things that the old forces do not possess. Confucius killed the Lu grandee Shaozheng Mao, saying: "There are five great evils in the world, and theft is not among them. A mind that is rebellious and dangerous, conduct that is perverse and obstinate, words that are deceitful and clever, a memory that is broad and remembers ugliness, and compliance with what is wrong and glamorous. Shaozheng Mao possesses all of these, and cannot be eliminated." This precisely describes their crimes!</p>
<p>Whenever a new force rises in the literary world, there will always be such people; the so-called people who achieve great fame and become pillars of the literary world, such as Wang Shizhen, Chen Meigong, Yuan Zicai, etc., are all like this, and today there are even more.</p>
<p>From old-style warlords to new-style gangsters, all regard them as people of the same kind, like licorice root in medicine, suitable for everything; and they are "universally accepted" and blend together like water and milk.</p>
<p>The old forces secretly laugh and are pleased: "To catch the bandits, you must first catch the king. Now, the newly emerging king is caught in our hands; they ultimately cannot escape our grasp. Who knew they would be so docile and understand people's intentions!" And having some new figures interspersed among them is enough to show that they are "new." – And this camouflage allows them to remain at peace without even transforming.</p>
<p>Those who have advanced into the circles of the old forces also secretly laugh and are pleased: "It was only ever a stepping stone to advancement. Why keep the bridge after crossing the river?" Aiding the oppressive and helping the wicked, how they bolster and augment the power of the old forces!</p>
<p>Originally, there were two distinctly separate boundaries: to advance or retreat, to come to the new or to go to the old. You are not allowed to hesitate, you are not allowed to waver, you are not allowed to equivocate in between. But now the battle lines are blurred; they are leading a portion of the youth to compromise with and surrender to the old forces; while at the same time, they still solemnly put on a front of new leaders. Their reading public has not yet fully realized their despicable behavior; their masses still retain some faith in them; they sell out their positions as new leaders, but at the same time, they use the old forces to consolidate their positions.</p>
<p>This influence is bad enough: a portion of the younger people, shocked by their past shouts and cries, almost to the point of superstition, excessively believe them, and then innocently begin to have doubts and waver about the new battle lines. Writing ancient-style regulated verse, writing lyrics and composing melodies, and even learning to carve seals and practice calligraphy – everything has returned to the bustling atmosphere of the Guangxu and Xuantong eras and the early Republic. How heartbreaking it is to talk about!</p>
<p>Who would have thought that things would change so quickly! From overthrowing old poetry and promoting new poetry, they turn around and start writing "lyrics" again; from saying that they would throw away all old Chinese books, it is not long before they are advocating writing fu! They advocate writing classical Chinese prose and reading more old books, saying that they want to gain something from old books.</p>
<p>If we were to talk about revolutionary "opportunists," then this group of writers and scholars are truly "opportunists."</p>
<p>They are also the same as political opportunists: they use their fellow travelers as a stepping stone to advancement. Once they step onto the highest level of the ladder, they immediately abandon them.</p>
<p>Today, the ones who advocate that university students should write classical Chinese prose in universities are not the ones who came from the New Culture Movement; today, the ones who say that they want to fill in lyrics and read ancient books are not the ones who gained the upper hand in the New Literature trend.</p>
<p>The true faces of the opportunists are finally hideously revealed.</p>
<p>Thus, the entire battle line is in disarray; everyone has forgotten what kind of crimes the Black Curtain Faction left behind; and they then mix into the new ranks, and the so-called "new people" no longer shout and no longer attack the old forces, and instead become "hangers-on" in the camps of those they previously regarded as enemies.</p>
<p>The new and the old are mixed together, the new and the old are compromising, and the battle lines that opposed them have been removed.</p>
<p>The world is at peace; it has returned to the bustling situation of the Guangxu, Xuantong, and early Republic eras.</p>
<p>But is the world really at peace?</p>
<p>Another new battle line, a new barrier, is being erected.</p>
<p>A group of past new people have been swallowed up by the circles of the old forces! But they will eventually walk the same path to destruction as the old forces!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Emperor Addiction <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>Some say that Puyi is dreaming of being emperor again. I, however, think that he is not dreaming of being emperor, but rather indulging in an emperor addiction; he is almost worse than Shi Jingtang, and is like Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu. Zhang Bangchang's puppet state lasted only forty-odd days, and Liu Yu's puppet state lasted only seven years. Puyi's puppet state, even if it is longer than Zhang Bangchang's, may not be shorter than Liu Yu's. How long can his self-satisfied theft of the imperial title last? However, like those addicted to opium, who know that it is extremely harmful, but only want to get their fix, and disregard everything to obtain it. Those with an emperor addiction are happy to be an emperor's subject, an emperor's nephew, a child emperor, or a grandson emperor. Even a local emperor or a bandit emperor is acceptable.</p>
<p>During the late years of Wang Mang's dynasty, Gongsun Shu, based in Shu, wanted to become emperor. He dreamt that someone told him, "Eight private strokes, the thread of a child, twelve is the limit." When he awoke, he said to his wife, "Although noble, the reign is short. What shall we do?" His wife replied, "If one hears the Way in the morning, it is acceptable to die in the evening, let alone twelve years?" So he established himself as the Son of Heaven and named his state Chengjia. During the Xiankang era of the Jin dynasty, Li Shou, based in Shu, also wanted to become emperor, and ordered a divination. The diviner said, "He can repeatedly count as the Son of Heaven." His subordinate Ren Diao joyfully said, "One day is enough, let alone several years?" Jie Siming said, "Several years as the Son of Heaven, which is better than a hundred generations as a marquis?" Shou said, "If one hears the Way in the morning, it is acceptable to die in the evening." Ren Hou's words were the best strategy. So he presumptuously took the throne. This is an example of someone indulging in a local emperor addiction.</p>
<p>Also, during the time of Emperor An of the Jin dynasty, Wang Shi gathered a crowd in Mount Tai and declared himself the Taiping Emperor, calling his father the Supreme Emperor, his elder brother the General Who Pacifies the East, and his younger brother the General Who Pacifies the West. Murong Zhen attacked and captured him, and beheaded him in the marketplace. Before his execution, someone asked where his father and brothers were. Shi replied, "The Supreme Emperor is covered in dust abroad. The General Who Pacifies the East and the General Who Pacifies the West were killed by the rebel army. Only I am alone and desolate." His wife angrily said, "You are only in this state because of your mouth! Why do you say that again?" Shi said, "Empress! From below, is there any family that is not broken, any country that is not destroyed?" The executioner struck him with the pommel of his sword. He looked up and said, "I may collapse, but I will never renounce the imperial title!" This is an example of someone indulging in a bandit emperor addiction.</p>
<p>Alas! Shi Jingtang's addiction to being a child emperor and Shi Chonggui's addiction to being a grandson emperor were already ugly enough. But the Southern Song dynasty, from Emperor Xiaozong onwards, shamelessly indulged in a nephew emperor addiction, so why criticize Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu for indulging in a subject emperor addiction? I just don't know what level Puyi is at now, indulging in his emperor addiction.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Review of "Jealousy" (Continued) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>From here, we can see the evils of the last World War, the waste of human bloodshed and sacrifice. The historical facts are clearly displayed before our eyes: the European War was a war caused by the uneven distribution of spoils by the imperialists, and the people of the participating countries were suffering from</p>
<p>life and weary of the whip of life, hoping for a huge stimulus and encouragement to change their lives, so they were misled by the false slogans of so-called justice and patriotism, exploited, and sent to the front lines of the war. If these people died, they would be blessed, because they would not have the opportunity to taste the more intense new pain of awakening after the war. It is very clear that these people were blind, that this war was an idealess melee, that their sacrifices were of no value, and that after a drunken frenzy, they awoke to see only loss, falling into an abyss of despair that even deprived them of all vitality. Their only hope was to change their lives through that war and create a new path of life, and this ultimately became a dream; and before the war, they were able to support the burden of life, but now, whether mentally or physically, they have become disabled people, still thrown back into the same weary and painful life as before, which is more unbearable than dying on the front lines.</p>
<p>Andre, the middle school teacher in "Jealousy," is a good example of this. Four years of captivity destroyed this man. Although his body is not disabled, we can see the hidden illness in his soul. His wife says that he needs a year of rest, which is too short; he needs a lifetime of rest. But after he returns, he still has to work as a hated middle school teacher, still has to be his wife's husband, and painfully fulfill all the responsibilities of being a person. He cannot bear it. At this time, even the smallest thing can become the cause of the destruction of life, and the suspicion or jealousy of his wife is only an accidental opportunity.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not very convincing to say that jealousy destroyed this man's happy life, and it is not right to put all the blame on this husband. However, in the event described by the author, the wife is in a passive position. Like her husband, Blanche also spent the same four years in captivity, suffering the same pain. According to the sociologist Rosso's analysis of the psychology of wartime people, these women were as bewitched as the men. Although they could not personally go to the front lines, they encouraged their husbands and welcomed all the soldiers who went to the front lines, because they were also oppressed by the weariness and difficulties of past lives, and they were also hoping for the creation of a new life. But the result of the war only brought harm, and life still went on the old track, and was even more miserable. Therefore, what Blanche, who represents these women, said when she thought of going to America to seek a new way of life, best expresses their general psychology. In this play, although Blanche is written as passive, can she not be in an active position in another play of life? If it is said that becoming active is indeed more common among men than women, is it not because the degree of stimulation and pain that the World War gave them is different? The amount of pain that the war gave them is directly proportional to the power they have to resist the old ways of life.</p>
<p>Look, in the whole play, only Andre's father did not have much disappointment after the war. He also suffered four years of pain, but he has nothing to be dissatisfied with because his son can return, because he is already a seventy-five-year-old man. When Andre expresses his grievances to him, we hear the old man say, "...Oh! Let it go, let's be quiet, you're home. Your woman loves you. Are you still not satisfied? I can guarantee with my head that she has not been unfaithful to you. But even if she has been unfaithful to you, what's the use of making a fuss now? Live a life of contentment for me and don't think about anything else. Everyone has come through such misfortunes." He does not understand his son, and he cannot understand the real reason for Andre's dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>I said at the beginning that, in my opinion, the original title of this book, "Rekindling the Broken Fire," is more expressive of the meaning of this play than "Jealousy," but if the breakdown of the love between the long-separated couple is seen as rekindling the broken fire, that is wrong. Being deceived by the meaningless World War, which made them hope for a new life, and that hope has not been fulfilled, is the real "Rekindling the Broken Fire"!</p>
<p>I have indeed seen this meaning from this play, and this meaning is also fully and truthfully expressed in the play, although the author has not clearly explained it, it is still a profound and good drama. The greatest lesson that this play gives us is that the last World War was a chaotic battle with no benefits, which only added another layer of unbearable pain to the people of Europe, and gave us nothing else. (The End)</p>

<p>"He no longer, longer—am I still alone after I undress him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he is alone, but he is very happy."</p>
<p>She saw the female guest shake her head sadly, but her own heart gradually became happy because she thought this answer was very appropriate.</p>
<p>"Is that really so?"</p>
<p>The female guest did not dare to fully believe her words. She did not say anything more, only nodding.</p>
<p>"Where did he go tonight?"</p>
<p>"To see a friend, he won't be back until very late."</p>
<p>"Then please tell him that a woman came to see him—tomorrow, tomorrow I can't get away, I can't come again."</p>
<p>"Won't you tell him your name?"</p>
<p>She deliberately asked.</p>
<p>"I think he should remember, and you should too—it's getting late, I think I should go. There are still some things I want to ask, but it's too much trouble for you."</p>
<p>"It's nothing, you can say whatever you want."</p>
<p>"Has he ever mentioned a woman to you?"</p>
<p>"No, he never talks about women."</p>
<p>"Do you know your mother?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I don't have a mother, I never knew I had a mother."</p>
<p>She suppressed the emotions rising in her chest and deliberately said this indifferently. But she saw the female guest looking at her with bright eyes, as if saying these words:</p>
<p>"You don't not have a mother, the one in front of you is your mother, don't you really know? Come here, child, I know I was wrong. I'm not worthy to be your mother, I haven't given you any motherly love since you were born, now come here, child, let me hug you, kiss you."</p>
<p>She understood these things, but she endured it and did not move, she saw that the female guest's eyes were covered with a thin layer of clear tears. But she deliberately looked away, pretending not to see it.</p>

<p>In the expression of spiritual life, they believe that worldly affairs are like smoke and clouds, and human life is like straw dogs. Therefore, in dealing with things, they adhere to the principle of not contending with others, muddling through, and regard international competition and national survival as something that can be ignored. This is the meaning of what Dai Dongyuan called "Dangers and ease do not linger in the heart, ten thousand bushels of floating clouds pass through the vast sky." Not impatient, not angry, containing and encompassing everything, leisurely and unhurried. Having this cultivation has its own spiritual victory. As for social morality, it is especially something that our ancient civilized country excels at. In dealing with people, we emphasize trustworthiness, preferring that the world let us down, rather than us letting the world down. Although we may suffer, justice will be upheld in the future. Etiquette and deference are even more the essence of our country's civilization. A gentleman does not speak ill when breaking off relations, and can still maintain friendly relations on the surface. This is etiquette, not taking what others like is deference. Mussolini's reason for thinking that Eastern civilization has "soul" and "thought" is probably based on this. It is his "understanding of a kind of psychology existing in Asia"!</p>
<p>However, when Britain showed goodwill to India in the past, it also said that India was an ancient country, praising the purity and non-action of Buddhism, which prevailed there, as the essence of Indian civilization. The unity of the Anglo-Saxon and the great Brahma nations could conquer the invasions and massacres of Spain and France. Later, the "unity" of Britain and India indeed became the "historical foundation" of the Anglo-Saxon nation, and British civilization rose from this, but India, which was rescued from Spain and France, was in a terrible state. Similarly, Britain played this trick in Egypt, and France in Annam. Therefore, the essence of this Asian Student Conference, which "hopes for harmony between Eastern and Western nations," does not lie in opposing civilizations "lacking soul and thought," but in: 1. Using the sweet words of uniting Eastern and Western nations to save the world's civilization from danger to show goodwill to the nations of the Far East, so that Italy, which is in conflict with France in the Mediterranean, can extend its power to the Far East. The unity of Eastern and Western nations has the same practical meaning as "the same script, the same race, co-existence and co-prosperity." 2. Praising the passive national character of Eastern nations, so that Italy, on the day it extends its power to the Far East, can still promote the beauty of "Eastern civilization" without strong resistance, and maintain the "spiritual victory" of Eastern nations.</p>
<p>Maintaining Eastern civilization, cultivating spiritual life, and restoring old morality once stirred up waves in China. Now this call is very weak. This is not because it has already been conquered by Western civilization, which lacks soul and thought. Needless to say, the promotion of maintaining Eastern civilization has been fully adopted in life. Even if the power of Western civilization conquers China again and turns it into a second India or Annam, it doesn't matter. Foreign warships and cannons will never break through the barrier of our "soul," and we will still be "spiritually" victorious!</p>
<p>Naturally, this spiritual victory will also be Mussolini's victory of "unity between Eastern and Western nations" in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e225">After Talking About "Eugenic Laws" <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Human evolution has reached its highest degree, and the struggle for survival is even more intense and tense. Darwin's great truth of "survival of the fittest" has dominated the entire course of our human race, and "might makes right" has followed it, dominating this world for twenty centuries. Just to savor this ending from the point of view of the preciousness of life, how tragic and bleak it is!</p>
<p>Those who are strong use force to bully the weak, but eugenicists harden their hearts and say that this is the victory of the superior and the elimination of the inferior, and that these weak people have no right to survive in this world, which is even more tragic and bleak!</p>
<p>The world is a place where the strong compete, and everyone wants to compete for strength and hegemony, so wars appear; mobile warfare, engagements, border wars, siege warfare, defensive warfare, annihilation warfare, attrition warfare, air warfare, land warfare, sea warfare, airplanes, tanks, torpedoes... all kinds of strategic weapons have also been invented and applied. This world is full of bleak destruction and brutal killing, and everywhere we can witness the preparation for war and the incitement to war, heroism, patriotism, iron-bloodedism! These nice-sounding terms are often hung on the bodies or mouths of those who are powerful. They hold their fists and carry their guns with self-importance, wanting to show off their skills in this world, which means to carry out a ruthless massacre of the weak, so that they cannot survive in this world.</p>
<p>If humans want to survive, they must be involved in this whirlpool of war. Individuals must prepare to be born from death, and countries must prepare to be defeated by war. When we open our eyes and look at it, isn't this the picture of the world? —The strong sing songs of victory, and the weak chant mournful tunes.</p>
<p>Darwin's theory was originally a very correct theory of biological evolution. Unfortunately, when the theory was applied to social problems, it gave rise to the iron rule of "might makes right," trampling on countless lives, and still trapping mankind in an abyss from which there is no return.</p>
<p>The Berlin telegram reported the other day: "The German government's law 'Eliminating Reproductive Function' will be implemented from January 1 next year. Approximately 400,000 people with hereditary diseases will be subject to this law, especially the disabled..."</p>
<h3 id="e226">Brother Mao and Sister Bao Travel the World <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>. This is naturally based on the principles of eugenicists, with the intention of strengthening the race and strengthening the seed. This contains the explosive potential of war, and the great ambitions of those heroes, patriots, and iron-bloodedists are also revealed in this.</p>
<p>The German nation is considered the most superior in this world, but after the Great War, it was slaughtered by the great powers and has not been able to turn itself around to this day. This is the most sad and tragic thing for the German people. It is the natural order and conscience to rise up and prepare to become strong. We cannot say that it should not be done, but if one side actively becomes strong and prepares to resist, then the other side will also actively become strong and prepare to suppress. The world is so troubled, and the fate of mankind is destined to encounter tragic and bleak days in this calamity!</p>
<p>"Germany will eliminate the reproductive function of 400,000 people." The future events caused by this matter, whether Germany becomes strong and suppresses others, or is defeated again and is forever suppressed by others, in any case, this is the greatest disaster and the greatest threat to human survival, and we who live in this world only hear such calls to prepare for war, and feel the threat of such disasters. Who is preparing for peace in this world? Who is thinking about the pain and suffering of the lives of these 400,000 people whose "reproductive function" is being "eliminated"?</p>
<p>Perhaps China is a thorough pacifist. Most Chinese people are "worshipers of reproductive organs," harboring the thought of "more blessings, more longevity, and more sons." Therefore, the disabled can raise deformed children, relying on these children to support them for their entire lives. The wealthy can buy maids and concubines, raising several, a dozen, or twenty children to enjoy their old age. Even the poor laborers who are insecure about their next meal, and even the beggars who beg for alms, don't care if they can't get enough to eat, but they must raise a few children. These small lives are held, led, wiped, and follow their parents to go hungry.</p>
<p>However, this pacifist is too weak, and today it is being bullied by the powers that believe "might makes right," without being able to exert any resistance. It just endures in silence, and sometimes even uses flowery words to please the strong. However, within this group of weaklings, they are not at all</p>
<p>polite, and often wield swords and dance with spears, launching expeditions of punishment, making this land without a clean place!</p>
<p>People in this world are preparing for war, and we in this world are pretending to be peaceful. But can this pretended peace hide our weak attitude? Can it crush the iron rule of "might makes right"?</p>
<h3 id="e227">Congratulations <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ren</p>
<p>Because a colleague was getting married, as usual, everyone had to chip in for a gift. But what would be a good gift to give? Wei Jun, who was experienced in the ways of the world, said that it would be best to give money. Because in this day and age, what everyone lacks is "it," and this is more practical than anything else. "Let them buy their own gifts! If they don't need to buy anything, they can use the money as reimbursement for the banquet, wouldn't that be more considerate of friends?" Wei Jun's words won everyone's approval, so many "shares" were wrapped in a large red paper envelope.</p>
<p>The next problem that arose was what words should be written on this red envelope. It had to be neither outdated nor inelegant. Everyone thought for a long time, all smiling without speaking, and I, holding a writing brush in my hand, was a bit embarrassed at this moment. Ping suggested four words: "Dragon and Phoenix Harmonize."</p>
<p>"Too old," Qing said.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's too old, but..." I said.</p>
<p>Qing retorted:</p>
<p>"But what? Say it!"</p>
<p>"I thought of an article about 'Dragon and Phoenix Ideology.' I don't like using those two words, but as for the words 'Harmonize,' I completely agree with them," I said.</p>
<p>"You're talking philosophy, we don't understand at all," Qing said.</p>
<p>"It's better not to understand. Once you understand, it's a bit uncomfortable. Maybe someone won't want to get married. Haha."</p>
<p>"What a wonderful theory is this? Tell us a little, would you?" Jing, who never spoke, wanted to hear the wonderful theory now. "It's a story, no! It's a philosophical conversation. It says that fathers always hope their sons become dragons; they always save money and cut expenses to find phoenixes for their sons. Once the dragon and phoenix wedding cakes are eaten, the sons soon become fathers, but they themselves have not become dragons, so they have to turn around and hope for their own sons. So this author concluded: 'Thousands upon thousands of young people have been harmed by the dragon and phoenix ideology. Their experience is insufficient, their knowledge inadequate, their bodies weak, and their burdens too heavy, damaging all their achievements. Many geniuses are buried and injured because of this, and society suffers a great loss. People still laugh and eat dragon and phoenix cakes, wear clothes with dragon and phoenix patterns, and use utensils with dragon and phoenix patterns, shrouded in an atmosphere of sadness, depression, bewilderment, and haze, advancing step by step with Father Time!' Doesn't this have some reason?"</p>
<p>"Reasonable! Reasonable! This article is more like a speech by Mrs. Sanger!" Wei Jun was quite enlightened.</p>
<p>"I don't agree! I don't believe a person's lack of progress is all because of marriage, and it's all the women's fault!" Qing was standing up for the women!</p>
<p>"Haha! What you say is also reasonable! Do you support 'Dragon and Phoenix Harmonize'?"</p>
<p>"Bah! I think it's old."</p>
<p>Ping then suggested "The Creator's Mischief," but Qing also rejected it because it was a bit inelegant, even though Ping cited many "nationalistic" words, she could not soften Qing's firm denial.</p>
<p>In the end, Wei, who was experienced in the ways of the world, said, wait for me, why bother working on these few words! He snatched the pen and wrote two large characters on the red envelope: "Congratulations." Everyone smiled and agreed without objection. Because these two words are neither new nor old, and are appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar. Wei is indeed a clever and capable person, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Qing then fell silent.</p>
<p>"What else are you dissatisfied with?" Wei asked. "I feel that life is always full of worries. In a person's marriage, what is there to congratulate? For example, Jian's marriage this time is the beginning of his suffering. These two words are just mocking them."</p>
<p>"Haha!" Wei laughed, "Miss Qing is also going to be a philosopher. But young people shouldn't be too serious. Difficulties are always going to be difficult. Let's talk about it when the time comes!"</p>
<p>"You yourself are a 'Let's talk about it when the time comes' philosopher!"</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I carefully read "An Employee's Food and Lodging Problems" published in your newspaper's amateur mailbox on the 20th of this month and feel that this problem is not as serious as Mr. Yu and your editor claim. In this day and age, the biggest fear is unemployment. If one has a job paying twenty-two yuan, as long as one "has a plan," there's no need to fear there's no solution.</p>
<p>I have a friend, Mr. Zhang, who has been in Shanghai for over twenty years. Initially, his salary was only fifteen yuan per month, and now it's only a little over forty yuan. His working hours are from 8 am to 6 pm, and the company only provides lunch, the same as Mr. Yu. He has three solutions: (1) Absolutely do not bring family to Shanghai, because this is the most uneconomical. (2) Sometimes rent a garret; sometimes four people rent a room together, with bunk beds. Those sleeping on the top bunk pay one or two yuan per month, and those sleeping on the bottom bunk pay double. (One of the four always knows someone who will rent even to those without families.) (3) Eat a full lunch, glutinous rice and fried dough sticks in the morning, and porridge and pancakes at night. Therefore, his monthly personal expenses used to be only five or six yuan, and now they are only ten yuan.</p>
<p>I don't want to take up too much of your newspaper's space, so I won't say more. We think, with Mr. Zhang's solution, can't everything be resolved! Sincerely, Yang Songqing</p>

<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>The big fat Mr. Zhang suddenly broke the silence in the room. An expression of great surprise first appeared on his big face, and then he said:</p>
<p>"Didn't the Today's Times report a young man jumping into the Huangpu River? Renjie might be..."</p>
<p>These words certainly attracted attention, but they were immediately refuted by Mr. Huang, who had a small mustache. Mr. Huang said: "That was a superficial student. His will said that he couldn't bear to see China's demise. It's not him."</p>
<p>"Moreover," I added, "Renjie is a man of strong will. He is most opposed to suicide. He says suicide is the act of the weak, a shameful act."</p>
<p>"Isn't he heartbroken? It's common for heartbroken people to commit suicide."</p>
<p>The big fat Mr. Zhang still insisted on his view.</p>
<p>"It depends on what kind of person he is. How can someone like Renjie, a heroic figure with ideas and accomplishments, be compared?"</p>
<p>The small-mustached Mr. Huang refuted again.</p>
<p>The big fat Mr. Zhang nodded, took a puff of his cigarette, and silently acknowledged that this made sense. Everyone was also silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mr. Lei, who had a melon-seed face and a red nose, shouted in a high-pitched voice: "Hey, I was chatting with Renjie a few days ago, and he greatly praised the bravery of the Northeast Volunteer Army, saying that what they were doing was meaningful. Could it be that he joined the Volunteer Army?"</p>
<p>"I've heard him say that too. Maybe that's it!" The big fat Mr. Zhang echoed.</p>
<p>The small-mustached Mr. Huang said with some doubt, "Probably not!"</p>
<p>"Wrong," I denied, "Renjie also scolded those volunteer soldiers for not being organized and unable to succeed."</p>
<p>"That's hard to say. Although he thinks they won't succeed, if he thinks he can succeed by organizing them himself, he might go."</p>
<p>The red-nosed Mr. Lei insisted on his view.</p>
<p>"I think he went to so-and-so. That's more believable," the small-mustached Mr. Huang said, strengthening his words.</p>
<p>"So-and-so?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, not necessarily!"</p>
<p>The big fat Mr. Zhang and the red-nosed Mr. Lei both denied it, as if it were their own business.</p>
<p>"I have evidence," the small-mustached Mr. Huang said. "The night before last, in the park, I saw Renjie talking secretly with a man in a cloth robe in the pavilion from a distance. After a while, that man left hurriedly. I went up to him, and Renjie was smiling very happily, looking at the moon in the sky. I called out to him, and his face immediately changed color. He looked back at me in a panic. When he saw clearly that it was me, the first thing he asked was if I had been there for a long time. I said I had just arrived, and then he smiled. That kind of panicked expression showed that he had a secret on his mind. When the person he was talking to left the pavilion, I saw that he was someone from so-and-so, with disheveled hair and unkempt clothes."</p>

<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(15) "Roar, China!" Director Ying Yunwei (Part 1)</p>
<p>If we think 1933 is worth remembering, then "Roar, China!," which premiered at the Golden Theater, will never disappear from our memory. Now, this director has moved from the stage to the screen. Because he is a noteworthy figure, I interviewed him at Yi Hua Company.</p>
<p>Sitting next to the stove, I asked him to talk to us.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to say?" he said. "I don't have any film works out yet, which makes it very difficult for me."</p>
<p>"I don't think it matters. Your work will be seen by us in the near future anyway. Please tell us about your journey from the stage to the screen."</p>
<p>"The transition from stage to screen is a very ordinary phenomenon. There is nothing particularly worth mentioning for me. In fact, my interest in stage plays comes entirely from film. Because I work in the shipping industry, I haven't had the opportunity to enter the film industry for ten years, so I had to engage in stage play experiments in my spare time. From "The Merchant of Venice" to last year's "Roar, China!," I have gained a lot of experience in drama. However, amateur drama, due to various reasons, cannot give us better results, because from the director to the stagehands, everyone is an amateur trying. At the same time, one performance cannot last more than a week, and the rent for the stage is expensive, which is not a condition for reducing seat prices and extending the dates. Therefore, people from other places cannot come to see the play, and most audiences cannot afford the high ticket prices, so it is not widespread. Therefore, one performance takes a lot of effort, but the effect is not as great as that of film. In addition, I have recently felt deeply that the shipping industry cannot allow me to develop. Instead of trying to do drama in my spare time, it is better to engage in film directly. Needless to say, in film, as long as you work hard once, it can be screened everywhere and exist forever. This is my motivation for joining Yi Hua."</p>
<p>"Can you briefly talk about the relationship between stage plays and film, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e231">Review of "Berkeley Square" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>|Produced by Fox. Premiered at Cathay|</p>
<p>After watching the large-scale production of "Cavalcade," we will not immediately forget the name of the director Frank Lloyd. Now he has released "Berkeley Square." He is British. In the silent film era, he made famous films such as "The Woman Disputed." These works were well-received in the United States in the past, especially "The Woman Disputed" and "The Voice of the City," which were recognized as his masterpieces. By the sound film era, some people believed that Love Romance-style works were not his forte. As for so-called masterpieces, they were even more impossible to reproduce.</p>
<p>When "Cavalcade" premiered in Shanghai, we were probably all very impressed with his archaeological spirit and the large scenes and sets that did not spare wages. However, in terms of the overall work, it is inevitably too focused on the development of the story, that is, the "story-driven" film as we say. In particular, it is depressing, obscure, and unwelcome to the general audience. Of course, we do not deny that he handled every scene of the play very meticulously and thoughtfully, but the story is too long, and the general audience cannot savor the dialogue, so he only ended up with a result of putting in a lot of effort but not being appreciated.</p>
<p>Now let's look at this so-called "Berkeley Square." His style is still the same as "Cavalcade," slow pace, quiet atmosphere, extremely boiling but suppressed emotions, melancholic and long sadness, delicate tenderness. These are undoubtedly the strengths of romanticism, and for the intellectual class, they are deeply moved by it.</p>
<p>Naturally, this extreme sentiment is not a good thing for young people who are striving to make progress, especially for young people who are worn down by reality, who will be subjected to a kind of bad anesthesia. We don't have to intuitively criticize the absurdity of the immortality of the soul, because we have long recognized that famous works similar to "The Sorrows of Young Werther" are definitely not good tonics for modern times; moreover, seeking a conclusion of love-supremacism in the immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>Of course, we will definitely not turn a deaf ear to the playwright's cursing of reality, so that the negative expression of worries about the current society, when Stanley, in the capacity of a person from another world, tells the dead of the eighteenth century about the civilization of the present world. But how cowardly and ridiculous is this!</p>
<p>As for the purpose of the play explained in the manual, it is simply the opposite of the film. Is this "Berkeley Square" really doing a counter-article? We believe that this kind of explanation cannot reverse the mistake of the work.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, if we only use the eyes of an appreciator and purely objectively accept this poetic technique, people with rich emotions and fascinated by old-fashioned art will definitely feel a certain degree of satisfaction. However, if we take critical learning as the principle, we can affirm that this is dead art, relics in the tomb. Moreover, there is no reason for non-subjective existence at all. For anything, it must be an objective fact, plus a subjective understanding. Leaving one's own standpoint and becoming a purely objective prisoner is ultimately not the attitude we should adopt.</p>
<p>After watching this film, we immediately recall Norma Shearer's "Smilin' Through," and even more remind us of Leslie Howard in that film. His amorous son's demeanor in "Smilin' Through" is once again taught to us in this film. This is probably his own personality. Whether in "The Green Hat" or "Secrets," he still performs with the same style of music analysis. As for that English girl who plays Helen Angel, although we rarely meet, she teaches people to keep a lovely impression. Isn't it easy to give people a good impression with that dignified, quiet, and affectionate posture?</p>
<h3 id="e232">The United Photoplay Service Second Studio's Autograph Book <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Recently, it has become popular in the United Photoplay Service Second Studio to place an autograph book and ask colleagues and friends to sign it to keep as a souvenir. The first was Wu Cun, the director of "Wind," followed by Cai Chusheng, the director of "Song of the Fishermen," actors Wang Renmei, Li Lili, and recently Sun Yu, the director of "Sports Queen," also made a book. Wu Cun's book is the most petite and exquisite, just like him; Cai Chusheng's book is the largest and most luxurious; Wang Renmei's book is almost the same; Li Lili's book is neither big nor small, just right to put in a pocket; Sun Yu's book is very simple and the price is the cheapest, because he always holds a simple doctrine, although a few dollars to buy an autograph book is no problem for him, but he always thinks that as long as the motive is sincere, there is no need to pay attention to the beauty of the paper and the sophistication of the binding. Among the several books, Wang Renmei and Li Lili's are almost full, Sun Yu's has only a few pages written on because it was recently made. Recently, Han Langen also has a book, but his book is an old-fashioned Chinese account book, even simpler than Sun Yu's. However, when he holds it with both hands and asks his colleagues to sign it, those who don't know it really think he is urging them to pay their debts?</p>
<h3 id="e233">"Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" to Be Completed in a Few Days <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>At the United Photoplay Service First Studio, under the efforts of the staff, Ma-Xu Weibang's new film "Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" has only one factory scene left to shoot. Because this scene is very large, and the studio is rushing to produce this film, the old and new photography studios are full of sets for this play, so this scene is built at the United Photoplay Service Second Studio. Now, the various scenes set up at the First Studio have been gradually completed, and the factory scene set up at the Second Studio is being rushed to be built by the set designer Wu Yonggang. It will be able to start shooting in a few days. When the shooting of this scene is completed, the whole play will be successfully completed. According to reports, this play is written and directed by Ma-Xu Weibang himself and is his first work after joining the United Photoplay Service. The leading actors are Gao Zhanfei, Chen Yanyan, Tan Ying, and He Feiguang, several major stars.</p>

<p>Chen Yumei in New Clothes Chen Yumei always wears cloth when buying new clothes in order to promote thrift. This does not seem to have anything new to offer, but under her ingenious conception, these cloth-made new clothes want to surpass any clothes made of precious materials. Recently, she used blue homespun cloth to make a cheongsam in a new style, matched with her graceful figure, which is really elegant. Now, Ye Qiuxin, Chen Chili, Wang Huijuan, etc., are all imitating this style of clothing, and this new outfit has become popular in Tianyi.</p>
<p>The Basketball Team's New Uniforms The Tianyi Basketball Team is divided into men's and women's teams. The men's team is hosted by Tang Xiaodan, and the women's team is hosted by Chen Yumei. Recently, Li Yingguan Wenda, etc., have joined the men's team, and Fan Xuepeng Lu Jianfen have joined the women's team. It is said that Chen Yumei, etc., plan to take advantage of the fact that "Happy Enemies" has not yet started shooting to schedule a match with the men's team to determine the winner. Because the original uniforms are not suitable for winter wear, new winter uniforms will be made for the men's and women's players to wear.</p>

<p>The weight of Bu Wancang, the director of "Golden Age," is extraordinary. Yesterday, in the director's room, he was discussing the script of "Woman" with Shi Dongshan. Director Bu conveniently sat down on a chair. Probably because he used too much force, with a loud "crack," one of the legs of the chair broke off. Fortunately, Lao Bu was clever and jumped up quickly, so he didn't fall. However, the people in the director's room all laughed.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Things turned out unexpectedly. This time, the Chinese team succumbed to the Jewish team, and countless fans could not help but feel very depressed, but in the film industry, a cinematographer was happy. Who is this person? Namely, Zhou Ke, a cinematographer from Yi Hua Company. Because Zhou Ke has the nickname of a Jewish millionaire, many people said to him: "Jewish millionaire, I didn't expect your country to be so powerful this year"! Zhou Ke listened and had a complacent look on his face, repeatedly saying: "If I hadn't come out, it would have been even more victorious"! At that time, it aroused great laughter.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>It's really strange. Everyone calls Yue Feng "Mr. Ichiboku Saburo" when they see him. The reason is that at the Yi Hua Company's get-together, Yue Feng and Wang Yin performed selling medicine. Yue Feng played a Japanese person, and this Japanese person's name was "Ichiboku Saburo." Therefore, Yue Feng has the nickname "Ichiboku Saburo." At the same time, Yue Feng is even shorter, which is quite in line with the nickname "Ichiboku Saburo," but Yue Feng often says "I dare not, I dare not."</p>

<p>"Where to Settle Down," distributed by the Great Light Film Company, stars Huang Manli, Lu Yan, Wei Guangshou, He Zhigang, etc. The purpose of the whole play is to focus on social trends, and the consciousness is very commendable. The director has even more surpassing skills in this film, and there are many small movements. Huang Manli plays Xuefen in the film, and her performance is incomparably sad, which can be said to be her most outstanding work. This film will be screened at the Beijing Grand Theater starting tomorrow (Sunday).</p>

<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Clark said, "I'm not afraid of anything as long as you love me." Joan Hyland said, "But you don't know who Frank Lock is. He'll be here any minute now." Before she could finish, someone was already knocking on the door. Joan ran to the door and opened it a crack. Lock asked, "Are you dressed yet?" Joan hid behind the door and whispered, "No, no, not yet." Lock said with an icy face, "Then what's that singer doing in your room?" After he said that, he stuck one foot in the door and pushed it open. Joan desperately wanted to protect Clark, but Clark had already walked up to Lock. Lock said to Joan for the first time in an angry voice, "Get out!" Joan pleaded, "I asked him to come. Please don't blame him." But Lock narrowed his eyes into a small slit, revealing a fierce light inside. He grabbed Joan's hand and threw her out the side door. Then, with a bang, he closed the door.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Clark calmly stared at Lock. This was a test of his courage. Even when Lock reached into his pocket, he remained unchanged. He said, "Lock, I didn't expect to meet you like this. I wanted to see you about Joan." Lock still showed an unpredictable attitude, waiting for Clark to continue. Clark said, "Now that we've met, I don't know where to start. I've heard people say you're very fair." Clark paused, knowing that what he was about to say might cost him his life. He said, "I know I love her more than I love my own life. If I can't get her in the end, I'm willing to face whatever happens. You can either have people beat me to death, or you can do it yourself, but you can't stop me from loving her." At this time, Clark's words poured out of his mouth: "Mr. Lock, I can't believe I'm standing here talking to you. I'm not someone who's afraid to die. But I don't have that one thing in the world, that thing that gives me the courage to stand in front of you and tell you the truth from my heart, and I can't live." He swallowed some saliva and said, "Joan has told me how much you've helped her. She is endlessly grateful to you, but you can't confuse gratitude with love. The reason I came here this time is not because she asked me to come - she doesn't want you to know I'm here - because she's afraid you'll be against me. I'm very lucky to be able to meet you today, so I can tell you how sincerely I love her. I want to marry her. Lock, it's all up to you. Please decide whether to let me die or let me live."</p>
<p>Lock put down his cigarette. He slowly walked up to Clark. He looked at Clark for a while and slowly said, "Okay, take good care of her." After he said that, he took his hat and gloves and left. A few weeks later, everyone in the vaudeville industry of Broadway and the big shots on Park Street all knew about the wedding of a nightclub star and a famous singer, and the president of the Manhattan Chicken and Duck Protection Association, Frank Lock, also wore a formal dress and a top hat, squeezed among the gentlemen watching the ceremony.
