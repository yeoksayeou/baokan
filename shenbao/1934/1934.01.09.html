<h3 id="c16">歐洲政局當前的危機 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>法國與德國之間，由歷史上遺傳下的惡關係，是不容易在短期内淸算的。何况法國正厲心戒備，恐怕德國一旦軍備充實，巴黎又要受人家的圍攻，所以堅持着「安全保障」牠以爲如果法國的安全得到了確實保障，則其他問題就不難解决了；而在德國方面，不滿於凡爾賽和平條約的拘束，又痛感經濟恐慌的壓迫，對經濟恐慌是一刻不能打破，也不容易就經濟本身找出路的，祇有在政治上打開一條途徑，再來尋求經濟的辦法，希特勒卽是以毁棄不平等的和約爲號召，而上政治舞台，所以他必須堅决主張德國不能以裸身當受其四隣的槍砲，「軍備平等」的要求，確有牠堂皇的議論。</p>
<p>自德國退盟而後，歐洲形勢頓見緊張，因爲德國退盟，將不免自行毁棄凡爾賽和約，以自國的意思擴張其軍備，法國在這時候，又豈肯旁觀，必然荷槍而起，同時爲法國衛星的諸小國，也會步伍法蘭西的後塵，積極從事於軍備。不過在這危機四伏一觸卽發之際，英國的舉動，却是很關重要，在英國傳統的對歐洲政策，是不願歐洲有一個獨覇的國家，戰前德國過於强盛，有機會來牠就要打倒牠，現在英國之於法國又何獨不然？英國的親法傾向雖然沒有變更，可是對德關係，特别是對於軍備縮小的意見，英法兩國就相差得非常之遠：在英國對軍縮的意見，以爲「試騐期間」終了之後，祇要法國在這期間中不能證明德國曾侵犯恊約，則法國有立卽縮减軍備的義務。可是在法國方面的主張，則以爲要德國表示誠意言和，與確無干犯軍備縮小的意思，牠纔能够缩小軍備。卽使英國的見解能够實現，德國也未必就能够允從，何况是法國還有這樣主張｜意大利｜根本否定德國的軍備平等要求。</p>
<p>再則，法西斯蒂首班｜意大利｜在理論上，在實際行動上，都未見得眞能與德國一致到底，不過目前，意國急於開拓北非洲的殖民地，需要地中海的覇權，在中歐想執各小國的牛耳，亞得利亞海當然更要由意國獨占去配，因此意國對凡爾賽和約，同表不滿，是以間接寄予德國以同情，與法國的對立，無論在海上，在大陸上，都日趨尖銳。　　　　（二）</p>
<p>在另一方面，還有一個舊時爲資本主義各國所共同注視，現在依然重視的蘇聯，目今更有舉足輕重之勢。以前德國的外交原是很巧妙的運用對蘇關係以脋制英法。所以牠在週圍逼迫的境遇之中，還能自闢一條政治上的生路。殊不料希特勒上台之後，激於一時的情感衝動，把對蘇關係弄得極其惡劣。</p>
<p>法國在這時候，曉得蘇聯大有左右歐洲政局的可能，而且在法蘭西的本意對德的防備，當然會要大過對蘇聯的防備，於是乘此時機，卽與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約，一九三三年九月初旬前内閣總理赫里歐伴同法政府代表者到莫斯科去，竟受了蘇聯當局的盛大歡迎，九月中旬法國航空部長，率領三架飛機由空中進訪莫斯科，以現任部長如此的行動，在蘇聯對外關係上，確是空前所未有的事。由此可以證明法蘇兩國之間親善的關係，乃愈趨於密接了。</p>
<p>法國外交政策的轉變，我們由赫里歐的法俄親善論可以看出來，法國旣然有意與蘇聯接近，則中歐諸小國當然惟法蘭西之馬首是瞻，會進行着對法的友善關係。就表面上看，這似乎是和平運動的象徴，而實際上正是武力爭鬭的前夜，武裝整備已逹極點的時候，這樣的外交運用，至少是以全力注視戰爭危機的發展，是極嚴重的準備戰爭！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>危機雖是這樣不斷的在那裹發展，並且還在那裹增加新的分子下去。而危機勃發的塲所和危機潛伏的心核所在，我們不能不試爲檢討。大家從歷史上知道世界大戰之前，巴爾幹是歐洲的火藥庫，結果萨拉齊一粒子彈引起了第一次世界大戰。現在情勢轉變，歐洲的火藥庫却不止一處了。</p>
<p>在那些火藥庫之中，爆炸最容易，形勢又最險惡的要算德國與波蘭之間的廻廊問題，所謂德波間的廻廊，在波蘭方面，誠然因此而得到了海上的出口，波蘭不復受德意志帝國主義的限制。可是在德國方面，則把東普魯士的領土生生地被人分開，這不但是普魯士的「戎克」（Ｊｕｎｋｅｒ貴族地主）不堪，卽一般德國人也胸懹憤恨。何况德國的國家思想又極發逹，所以推翻凡爾賽和約的聲浪彌漫全德國。歐洲政局的危機，這是最急迫的一個。</p>
<p>其次是中歐的奥匈兩國和多腦河流域的小恊商國間，從民族問題到一般政治關係，經濟關係，糾纏不淸，法國從中運用來鋳成牠在歐洲的覇權，意大利也要在這時候發生作用，於是問題就更加嚴重起來了。同時捷克斯拉夫，巨哥斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞，也决不肯讓德國的勢力過度膨脹，牠們現有的力量雖然還不足以防止德奥全併的運動。可是牠們可以請求法國的帮助，請求意大利的恊力，這又恰是牠們兩國所正要作的。因此中歐的糾紛又增加一重爆炸性了。由以上簡略的叙述，可以看出歐洲諸國糾紛的綜錯和對立危機的嚴重。</p>

<p>｜在中央紀念週演說</p>
<p>私人系統軍隊應予消滅</p>
<p>（南京）中央八日晨九時、舉行一一二次紀念週、到中委葉楚傖張繼汪兆銘陳立夫李宗黄鄭占南謝作发王祺曾仲鳴紀亮及職員共六百餘人、由汪兆銘主席、並作報告如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、今日所要說的、只是很簡單的一點、卽是關於陳李在福建叛變、及因之而起的感想、自從九一八以來、本黨同志感於國難嚴重、把從前一切糾紛、完全撇開、主張團結一致、以共負救亡圖存的責任、兩年以來、關於團結之效果、雖然尙有種種遺憾、但是可怕的内戰、總算避免、雖然地方上衝突、還是時時發作、而中央對於地方郤始終保持着委曲求全的態度、不肯輕於决裂、爲的是救亡圖存、莫要於内部一致、在此兩年之内、對内用兵只限於剿除共匪、因爲共匪是不要祖國的、無從與說救亡圖存、前年淞滬戰急的時候、中央調江西軍隊赴援、他郤趁勢去攻贛州、去年華北戰急的時候、中央調江西軍隊赴援、他郤趁勢去攻南昌、由此兩役、大家知道若不盡力剿除共匪、則救亡圖存的工作、無從做起、最近陳李、在福建叛變、他的目的、在顚覆中華民國、毁棄中國國民黨、其不要祖國的心事與共匪一樣、所以他會毅然聯共、其實聯共也說不上、只能說是降共、中央對之萬不得已只能照剿除共匪的方法、從事剿除、在這時候、有人主張和平解次的、也有主張停戰的、他們和平解决的方法、是要陳李取消僞國僞政府、同時要中央改革政制、及所謂「賢路不妨一避」我們試想這種主張、有沒有實現的可能呢、陳李所不滿意的是政制麽、是人的問題麽、如果是的、他何必要取消中華民國取消中國國民黨、所以和平解决的方法、在陳李一方面是不會發生若何效果、而在中央一方面、則會引起極大的危險、因爲今日在陳李一方是要毁棄黨國、在中央一方是要維護當國、在這奮鬭當中、若忽然提出種種改革方案、無異要使中央内部發一動摇、無異響應陳李、以進行傾覆中央之計劃、設使中央一旦不幸傾覆、則維護黨國的工作、遂隨以消滅、這是何等的危險、所以和平解决這四個字是包含無數陰謀罪惡在裹頭的、凡我同志、不可不深切認識、總之、陳李此種叛變、是與黨國不能同時存在者、除了盡力剿除、實在沒有其他救治的方法、這種治標工作、凡我同志、如果念及我們因救亡圖存不撲滅叛變降共的陳李、當然對之不生異議的、兄弟如今所要說的是除了這些治標工作之外、更進而討論及一個比較根本的問題、這問題是十九路軍如何會叛變呢、陳李如何會使十九路軍叛變呢、在十四年間、十九路軍本是國民革命軍之一部份、十五年間、又骒北伐軍之一部份、自此以後、剿匪工作抗日工作、都盡過不少的力、前年調去福建、其唯一任務、便是剿除共匪、以東路之任相付託、冀其能與北路西路南路恊同動作、完成包圍殲滅的計畫、他的努力經過是如此的、他的當前任務又是如此的、爲什麽以一枝國民革命的軍隊而會公然做叛變國民革命的的事呢、爲什麽以一枝剿共的軍隊而會公然做聯共甚至降共的事呢、如果說由於陳李野心所指使、那麽何以十九路軍全體將士都這樣盲心盲目的聽他指使呢、照此看來、設使一旦陳李要做皇帝、十九路軍全體將士也便要做陳橋迎駕黄袍加身的故事了、這個現象、是狠詫異的、而搆成這個現象之原因、果何在呢、這是我們所不可不十分省察的、自然、中國土地廣大、交通不便、政治力量經濟力量都不容易集中、所以軍人叛變的事、隨時可以發生、但是軍事組織之未盡着軍事訓練之未充分做到、所以兵士品質不良、容易爲將校所操縱、只要有覇才有野心的將校、組織了一個幹部、便能駕駛兵士、使成爲私人系統、今日做國民革命軍人、樹靑天白日旗、明日做共匪走狗、樹紅藍地黄星旗、都可以無所不爲、這種現象、這種原因、如不能剷除、則中華民國的前途、尙有無窮的障碍、關於這一點兄弟以爲我們同志必須十二分的認識淸楚、如果我們不於此着意、而去商量、什麽政制、兄弟　爲總　是無效的、例如近來有些人主張開放政權、其目的在結束訓政提前開始憲政、又有些人主張維持黨的專政、其實這些紛爭、總理生前早經决定了、總理主張訓政爲國民革命過程中必不可少的一階段、因爲國民革命要掃除一切建設一切、不用訓政則不能集中政治力量經濟力量、而同時總理又說明訓政之目的、指出訓政與開明專制之不同、總理說、開明專制以專制爲目的、而訓政則以共和爲目的、所以勵行黨治培植民權是國民革命的唯一出路、用不着再來紛爭的、如今且不用細說、所要懇切說明的、却是私人系統軍隊若不能根本消滅、則無論憲政無從實現、卽訓政亦無從實現、私人系統軍隊存在横行無忌、則所謂憲政無從實施、這是無須多說、何以說連訓政也無從實現呢、如今有些人感於國事之紛亂、以爲倘使能如意大利之法西斯黨專政、未嘗不是振衰救弊之一法門、但是我們想想意大利法西斯黨專政以前、參戰時候、意大利所出的軍隊是多少呢、總數超過四百萬、死傷的人數呢、死了的六十五萬餘人、殘廢了的四十五萬餘人、傷了的一百餘萬人、而在法西斯黨進軍羅馬的時候、所謂四軍團的數目、照反對黨所說、不過萬餘人、卽就莫索里尼自傳所說、進軍羅馬成功以後檢閱黑衫健兒武裝起來的不過六萬餘人、而進軍羅馬的時候、政府雖發令軍隊征討、軍隊不肯受命、以至政府傾倒、莫索里尼受命組閣、以實行法西斯黨的政策、我們由此可以看出意大利在法西斯黨專政以前、他的軍隊是用於對外戰爭不是用於對内他的國内、政權之更迭是依於民意之從逹、不是依於軍隊之勝負、在法西斯黨進軍羅馬之前共產黨在各處佔領工厰、破壞交通騷擾不堪、完全失了人民的同情、而政府對之萎弱無能、舉棋不定、又完全失了人民的信仰、所以軍隊對於法西斯黨之進軍羅馬、不加以阻碍因爲軍隊有些常識、所以莫索里尼能憑着藉之以實行其政策、如果當時意大利軍隊也、如私人系統軍隊一樣、則早已一部份爲帮助政府而向進軍羅馬的法西斯黨加以打擊、一部份又爲帮助法西斯黨而向政府攻擊、這樣、則意大利國内早已分裂起來、大打特打、打個不休、如何有進軍羅馬這般容易、由此可知私人系統軍隊如不根本消滅、不但憲政無從實現、卽訓政亦無從實現、决非過論、數年以來、有些人說、訓政沒有成績、其實不是訓政沒有成績、乃是訓政沒有開始、而訓政所以不能開始、則由於以上所說阻碍、並沒掃除、這是我們所十分痛心、而又不能不十分承認的、我們如果看淸楚了這一點則除了所謂治標工作之外、應該更加努力從事於治本工作、所謂治本工作改良軍事組織、加緊軍事訓練、打破私人系統、養成純粹一致的國民革命軍隊、固然必要、而尤其必要的、乃在培植民權、所謂培植民權、不僅在增加人民之政治力量、尤在增加人民之經濟力量、照近人國家組織、及其在世界的關係來說、國家民族的生存在於經濟之自給自足、所謂政治力量、不過以之爲經濟力量之保障而排除其障碍、因之、所謂民權、亦當注重於經濟之發展、經濟發展、則人民權力自然隨以增加、不但可以裁判私人系統軍隊、且可使私人系統軍隊、根本上不能發生、不能存在、這可說是治本工作中之治本工作、我們要知道槍砲固可制裁反動、尤能使反動根本消滅、從前說過、治本莫急於生產建設、其意義卽在於此去年十一二月間、我們同志因陳李在福建叛變、心靈中受了無數的苦痛的壓迫、從這種苦痛的壓迫之中、我們發生一種勇氣來、我們加倍精誠團結、加倍對於主義認識淸楚、加倍於努力實行、這樣我們定能於此風雨飄摇的環境中、奠定了國民革命的基礎、（八日專電）</p>

<p>主犯在逃巴央納市長被拘</p>
<p>國會議員不得兼任律師職</p>
<p>巴黎警察將改隸中央管轄</p>
<p>（巴黎）巴央納公債舞弊案已引起全法人士之公憤、恐將影響現内閣甚鉅、與公債事有關之國會議員巴央納市長加拉特刻已被捕、現囚於巴黎市政府監獄内、將以竊盜·僞造·非法利用公家文件及基金·欺詐·及接受臟物等罪被控、加拉特宣稱、余亦一如他人、被欺騙所害云、總理官邸今日否認旭丹要求殖民部長逹里米爾辭職之說、據晨報稱、旭丹内閣明日將總辭職、然後再由旭丹組閣、今日有律師一百五十餘人在司法部外遊行、並呈請當局、凡爲國會議員之律師、應禁止執行律師職務、現時竟有此次公債案高級人員曾受賄之謡言、今晚聞有人在查摩尼見此案主犯財政家史逹維斯基、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）自巴央納大舞弊案發覺後、據此間一般人之猜測、法總理旭丹及全體閣員、將於明日一律辭職、若殖民部長逹立米能自動辭職、則法内閣全部或可有存在之希望、逹立米係公認與此案有關、然旭丹則極力爲之辯護、巴黎新聞界探悉、閣員中尙有二人亦與此案有關、據政界一般輿論、謂閣員若不自動辭職、終必爲國會推倒、緣國會將於九日開會、屆時法總理旭丹將親臨受審云（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）巴黎各報預料、總理旭丹因債券騙案、將改組内閣、赫禮歐或將在新閣中長外交、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於斯逹維斯基騙案、埃克西有報發表消息云、「殖民部長逹利米哀辭職一層、昨夜尙無任何决定、一般人以爲此事在今日内閣會議以前不致發生、但内閣全體辭職一舉、已計議及之、俾大總統勒蒲命得任命旭當另組新閣、而新閣閣員亦可於星期四全體出席國會、一般人以爲前總理急進黨首領赫禮歐或將參加旭當新内閣、新内閣今晚卽可組織就緒、總之、在星期四日以前、衆議院無論對於斯逹維斯基案或其他問題、不致提出討論、緣衆院假滿之後、例須選舉主席團、必俟星期四日始可發出也」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）此處勝利報今日刋載波蘭外長貝克少佐之重要談話、詳論該國最近之外交形勢、貝克之談話復涉及國聯、彼稱、利用國聯組織以尋求國際合作較高之體係、在波蘭方面雖未曾减少其努力、但國聯在東歐方面實始終未剛强也、貝克對於德波間感情之增進頗示愉快、但彼又謂、此種政治動作頗能造成他方面之不滿、蓋波蘭與德國間之爭執、舉世認爲國際集會中不可缺少之成功、亦爲國際政治上無法解决之問題、但至與德政府開誠談判之後、始知實際上與報纸的描寫者頗多出入也、貝克氏繼復論及波蘭與蘇俄邦交之恢復、謂係尋求新路徑與積極效果之理想的努力、而波俄兩國間關係進展之每一程、均有積極的宣言及政治文書爲之保障云、至於波蘭與法國之關係、貝克氏稱、關於此節並無新事蹟可述、但卽此一端已可認爲積極之宣示矣、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>謂胡漢民表示暫無入京意</p>
<p>西南對中央諒解程度增進</p>
<p>胡氏主張係對事並非對人</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、年底偕夫人等赴斐律濱、作海上旅行、途中便道赴港粤、分訪胡漢民·陳濟棠·及西南各中委、洽商時局問題、茲已於昨晨八時三十分、偕傳秉常等、乘大來公司格蘭脫總統輪返滬、其夫人則擬在粤稍留、並未同來、孫氏抵滬後、對記者表示、胡展堂氏無來京意、粤組第三政府說、絕無其事、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>抵埠情形　大來公司格蘭脫總統輪、於昨晨七時三十分進口、停泊浦東白蓮涇大來碼頭、當時立法院委員馬超俊·陳劍如·吳經熊·及秘書長梁寒操·實業部次長劉維熾·内政部次長傳汝霖·外交部駐滬辦事處長余銘·市保安處長楊虎·公安局長文鴻恩·社會局長吳醒亞·市政府秘書唐士煊·等、均登輪歡迎、迨八時三十分、孫氏由江海關碼頭登岸後、卽逕返哥倫比亞路私邸休息、預定在滬勾留一二日、卽行返京、向中央報告此行經過、</p>

<p>孫氏談話　孫氏返寓後、旋卽延納各報社記者、據談、本人此次偕内人等赴斐、作海上旅行、途中並便道赴港、訪胡展堂、旋又往粤、晤蕭佛成·陳伯南·諸氏、交換時局意見、結果、擬將胡氏上年十二月十七日、在港所發表宣言之八項主張、先向中常會提出討論、看大家意見如何、再作决定、將來是否作成提案、向四中會提出、亦在會中討論後决定、</p>
<p>西南態度　孫氏又謂、本人在廣州僅逗留一日、故無較多時機、與西南各委詳談、祇與陳伯南等路事晤商、因悉粤方各委、對政治主張、大致以胡之主張有主張、至將來究以何種方式接受其主張、則並未談到、胡氏所主張之八項原則、其中較爲重要者、不過四項、（一）軍人不得干政、軍權屬於政府、（二）民權解放、確實保護人民言論出版集會結社一切自由、（三）中央與各省實行均權及其辦法、（四）財政公開、執行預算制度等、胡氏現尙無來京之表示、至對人問題、胡氏完全不談、總之、中委張溥泉等此次南下之結果、已使西南對中央之諒解程度、爲之增進矣、粤組第三政孫科氏下圇時攝影（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>胡等對閩　孫氏復稱、胡氏及西南各中委對於陳銘樞等此次在閩之毁黨滅國荒謬舉動、殊不以爲然、是以深望陳等能早日悔悟、自動撤銷所謂「人民政府、」至中央方面是否將福州佔領後、軍事暫告一結束、其他問題、均用政治手腕解决、余因在旅行途中、故尙不得其詳、總之、閩省事變、除採用軍事予以制裁外、别無妥善辦法也、余擬在滬稍留一二日、卽行返京云云、</p>

<p>迫讀日文企圖同化</p>
<p>李延祿劉斌兩君報告</p>
<p>遠東社云、東北義勇軍副總司令孔憲榮、於去年十二月二十一日、特派該部少將參謀長李延祿、曁少校參謀劉斌、由穆稜行營、賷命由哈轉道來滬、晉謁駐滬代表張楚玉、報告該軍最近戰鬥情形、遠東社記者、昨訪李劉兩君於其旅邸、當蒙延見、並將各情一一見告、茲爲錄誌如次、</p>
<p>賷命來滬　本人於去年十二月二十一日、奉孔副司令面諭、囑來滬晉謁敝部代表張楚玉、報告本軍最近戰鬥情形、此來轉輾途中、備嘗甘苦、計自二十二日由穆稜總部行營出發、偕劉參謀斌同行、均化裝窮民、步行至哈、抵哈時曾經日僞軍數度盤查、以入關回籍答、始脫虎口、在哈稍停、卽乘車至大連、由大連乘輪、於昨六日抵滬、所幸一切化險爲夷、未生其他意外事件、　　東寗苦戰　本軍自孔副總司令返防後、軍心大振、與日僞軍一日數戰、逹兩月有餘、本人率部參加、亦數十餘次、廢歷十月初旬、曾兩度攻襲東寗、結果、卒被我軍克復、當時總部設立該縣、詎我喘息未　、日軍卽派飛機十餘架、步馬兵共二萬餘、採大包圍戰略、包圍東寗、我部腹背受敵、勢殊危殆、深幸將士用命、拚死肉搏、得出重圍、現將部隊重新整理、避居附近各縣、以待機緣、</p>
<p>缺乏彈藥　查本軍此次退出東寗、最大原因、厥爲彈藥乏援、全恃肉搏而戰、倘有充分接濟、日僞雖强、亦不堪一擊、蓋彼所恃者、惟器械精良耳、加以該地早已地凍、本軍给養服裝、多得自當地人民密助、本人此來、係代表敝副總司令致謝各界以前援助、兼請求各界以國家民族爲念、源源接濟本軍彈藥、俾便拚命殺賊、不致功虧一簣也、</p>
<p>日人野心　日軍自佔領我東北後、最近數月來、其行動大加改變、此點、敝司令曾囑本人公告後方國人、俾知日人野心之一斑、查日軍以前不過侵佔滿洲及附近各省而已、近則亟圖内蒙、以實行其大陸政策之迷夢、自去年十二月起、逐漸移民吉省、前之海龍河一帶、均屬韓人、原名海龍河、現改爲新安鎭、現此鎭一帶、日人迫令韓人他移、而佔據之、並設立機關一所、置一長官、名爲政治指導員、統治當地一切行政、土地悉被瓜分、我國同胞、完全絕跡、</p>
<p>殺戮政策　東北各地居民、歷爲集族成村而居、分小村大村兩種、凡小村居民、日人卽逐其積居大村、不從者、或燒毁其村落、或以義軍名義殺戮其田地產業、其中尤以仇視山東人爲最甚、如能向日人請求入關回籍者、則特别歡迎、否則不以義軍名義相加、卽以共產黨名義而屠殺之、前月初間、由直隸山東各會館、資送入關回籍者、總計不下萬餘人、</p>
<p>抽丁練團　自本年一月一日起、日軍實行抽丁練團政策、家有三丁者、抽其二·練爲預備旅·一丁者抽爲壯丁團、護衛地方、所抽練之丁、以攻打中國人、攫奪中國人土地爲目的、並須全家拍照一纸、以資憑證、設有嫌疑、全家俱戮、凡有不願充丁者、以反搞命令論罪、處死刑、再中國人能吃食鴉片者、日人對之、甚爲恭敬、認爲闊人、如販買鴉片一兩以上者、處半年或三二年徒刑不等、販買十兩百兩者無罪、此種獎勵吃食鴉片政策、無非欲亡我民族、言之實堪髮指、</p>
<p>更易思想　我國人民居住東北各省、屬於日人範圍之内者、均宜注意王道思想、實行跪拜、口呼萬歲、如有新思想者、爲反動、年幼者、强入日文學校、貫輸日本思想、廢除中國學說、種種滅亡我民族事件、舉不勝舉、</p>
<p>離間國人　日前報載、敝總司令王德林孔憲榮組織華東共和國云云、此事絕對不確、查華東共和國名義、去年卽已產生、我兩總司令對之、異常鄙視、認爲志士救國、唯在身體力行、何有於另立名義、蓋此等謡言、悉爲哈埠日人所造、藉以離間國人、王孔兩總司令爲此事、堅囑本人來滬公示國人、一切自有事實爲證、請勿輕信、　　事畢赴防　本人此次來滬任務、已如上述、在滬不欲多所躭擱、稍留數日、卽行轉道回防復命、繼續未了工作、所望國人一致奮起、眷念東北同胞、拯救於水深火熱之中、本軍雖膡一兵一槍、亦當拼死到底、以熱血換取國人同情、爲種種異日收復東北失地之芽也云云、</p>

<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>上次買了一本貴館目錄彙編之後，看見了貴館的「讀書指導」的内容和辦法、我非常欣喜，因爲這在現階段中的確是一椿有價値的事。　　五年前，我還在學校裹讀書，但是我絲毫感覺不到讀書的興趣，｜我不要讀的書，學校拚命讓我讀，反之，我要讀的書，在學校裹却沒有機會給我讀。雖則學校不禁止我讀我所要讀的書，但是爲了預備學校功課，餘暇的時間已是有限，加之，又沒有人給我帮助，讀書遇了困難，也沒有機會解决。因此當初熱烈的願望，竟無法實現。然而這種願望，却不因此而消沉，反因不能實現的原故，使我十分苦悶，並且時時刻刻的糾緾在我心上。</p>
<p>近幾年來脫離了學校，到社會上做事，雖說每天工作時間要八九小時，甚至十時十一時也說不定，並且第逢星期也無例假，但是每日也有一二小時餘暇時間，儘可做點私事或讀點書。於是我便想實現我的願望，然而煩悶却更多更深了。</p>
<p>我是一個喜歡研究社會科學的人，其對尤於現在的社會，將來究竟要變到什麽樣子，我是最關心的。但是現在解釋社會現象的學說，却是異說紛紜，五花八門，使我目眩神迷，莫衷一是。譬如「苏聯研究」罷，在不久以前是很盛行的，介紹蘇聯研究蘇聯的書籍不下百十種，專門研究蘇聯的刋物也有二三個，算來研究資料旣這麽多，蘇聯的各種文物制度應當是很淸晰的呈現在我們的面前了。但事實上却適得其反，我們看的書報超多，却愈糊塗，愈不能使我們了解蘇聯。同樣一椿事有好幾種說法，有時竟有兩種截然不同的說法。某人或某本書上說蘇俄農業是一個大大的失敗，有人又說它是一個大大的成功。這已經是够使人糊塗了，但還有比這更使人懷疑的，我在某本雜誌上看見一篇論文裹說蘇聯制度是國家社會主義制度，但在另一種刋物上却有人把它當做國家資本主義制度。若照數學上取消因子的辦法，把「國家」兩字消去，豈非變成兩個迥然不同，含義絕對相反的名詞｜資本主義制度與社會主義制度。先生，這該多麽能使人迷惑啊！</p>
<p>上面不過隨手舉一個例子，像這類的事正多着呢。所以，我希望貴館的「讀書指導」的最主要的工作是指出一條讀書的正當路徑，做我們讀書，研究的指南針，免得我們在黑暗的歧途中瞎摸瞎走，以致誤入歧途，爲不合理的學說所迷惑，或者因摸不着頭腦的原故，而陷於煩腦，苦悶。（胡傑）</p>

<p>— 紀于</p>
<p>摶摶的大地，上面登着芸芸的衆生；頣是圓的，趾是方的，五官齊全，四肢不缺，會行動，會說話，會工作，會吃飯睡覺，會征服萬物，會發表意見，會姦淫擄掠，會殺人放火，……這就呌作人，人是最高貴的，最靈敏的，領導羣衆的，支配自然的：倘使沒有了人，世界一定要毁滅。</p>
<p>隨便那一個人，在求出世之前，沒有一個不是在娘肚裹登上十個月，然後生出來的。那怕他是一等的英雄偉大，總逃不了這個母胎：决沒有一個大好老，是會從石頭縫裹鑽出來的，至于其他的人，那也毋須說得。</p>
<p>吾們光說是人：要曉得人裹面高高低低的，不曉得要分着多少等級？就像上等階級中人，他裹面再可以分優等最優等特等；中等下等裹面，當然也可以細細的分出等級來；例如當車夫的，有汽車夫，包車夫，黄包車夫之别；當茶房的，有在火車上的，大飯店裹的，小旅社裹的之分。這也不必去細說，總括一名，只好分上中下三等：上等的人，當然他的架子，有他的塲面，飲食起居，以及其他一切，……都是處着極優適的地位；那下一等的，自然談不以什麽架子塲面，惟其沒有架子和塲面，因此他的生活簡單，反而容易解决。</p>
<p>惟獨這個中等階級的人，最最尷尬：說上不上，說下不下，嵌在這個篩眼眼裹，要上去，沒有這個力量，要下去，又坍不落這個臺，小小的塲面是要的，外邊的應酬交際；是罷不來的；大餅不肯當飯吃，門房破屋不肯當作居室；靑布衫灰桌裙，是穿不來的；上等人要去軋軋的，體面是要的，衣衫襤褸了，就怕在人面前走了，倒不及拉黄包車的，肚子餓了，蹲在人行道旁，吃吃大餅油條；或者吃一碗江北女人的菜粥，又不及那些工匠，空閒的時候，在小酒店裹，戤櫃檯喝白乾，剥花生米，嚼鹹蘿葡，吃醬肉屑，反而無罣無碍，可以不顧一切，我行我素，試問這輩中等階級的人，能乎不能？因爲不罷，所以在社會裹面，受盡許許多多的痛苦，這就呌卡人，也就是做卡人所得的結果！</p>

<p>— 王沿津</p>
<p>｜爲民立中學三十週年而作｜</p>
<p>民立中學創辦以來，已經三十週年了。上自敎職員，下至校友同學，都很熱烈的去紀念它。它爲什麽給人這樣熱烈地去紀念呢？它本身有什麽價値呢？我現在可用瘦鵑先生在民立中學三十週紀念刋上所寫的一段來解答。他說：「誰不知道民立中學已有了三十年的歷史？誰不知道民立中學的精神最飽滿，三十年如一日，年華儘管老大，依然是富有朝氣？誰不知道民立中學學生最多，敎師最好，課程最嚴，管理方法啊得當？誰不知道民立中學是蘇氏昆仲三十年來的心血結晶，而尤其是蘇校長個人的心血結晶，因此種種，民立中學儼然爲上海一切中學校的代表，也可說是全國一切中學校的代表。</p>
<p>我也是民立校友之一，此次紀念，雖因窮忙的緣故，沒有盡過絲毫微力；但是總不敢忘掉師長敎訓的恩德，時時刻刻把民立兩字放在民頭，努力地奮鬥，負起復興民族的一部分責任來，同時希望在全中華的辦理學校者，都要像民立的認眞熱烈。</p>
<p>從前的自由談，現在的春秋，是瘦鵑先生編輯的，内容的優美，都頼着他精於選擇，他對讀者很忠實地服務，至於他有這樣良好的精神，據說也在民立中學養成的，那末民立中學之對於讀者，也有間接的貢獻了。</p>

<p>第二十回</p>
<p>絮語燈前苦民訓弱息</p>
<p>杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>那甘積之却正相處在他的反面，當日在大路上遇着了他，自己並不作什麽懇切的言語，冷冷的就走了。回到家裹一想，這可不對。由桂枝的臉上看來，分明深藏着一段難言之隠。再聽他的話音，分明是很依戀於我的。他雖是和人定了婚，却又未曾出閣，假是我願意娶他，他願意嫁我，這一段婚婟，那是很容易翻案的。情塲變幻，向來沒有定凖，果然把他再把握到我手上來，也正未可知，我又何必把這樣一個機會喪失掉了。他有了這樣一個轉念，把一副灰冷的襟懷，又從新燒熱起來。第一步呢，就是要探一探桂枝的口氣，究竟怎麽樣？不料由第二日起，就不見桂枝的面。每次由他大門口經過，也故意延誤幾步，却不住的偷眼去看大門裹的動作。他們這大門裹面，本來就人口簡單，天氣一凉，他們這裹面的人，都藏在屋子裹，更是不看到一個人影，積之想着是了，必是桂枝恨我對他太冷淡了，也灰了心，這更不是他的過，而是我的過，我必須把我回心轉意的計畫，婉轉的告訴他，看他態度怎樣？積之這樣的想着，雖是在楊家門口經過，並不見裹面的人，然而每日由這裹經過的次數，那可是更多。至少是每日正中午一回，太陽將落山的時候，又是一回。有一天，約在上午十一點鐘的時候，積之又在楊家徘徊。同時心裹就想着，他並不是那極端守舊的姑娘，連大門不出的人，現在忽然深藏在家裹，不肯露面，這有兩個原因，不是害了病，便是受了拘束。關於這件事現在已經和楊家斷了往來，如何去探聽消息。（二八六）</p>

<p>這是我病後第一次的遠足。</p>
<p>在朝　初上的時候，我乘街車到了董这渡碼頭，碼頭上已經聚集了不少的人，小販　　我跳上渡輪，渡輪就開行了。我因爲不願受艙中的悶氣，我信步走到船尾，一個年老船夫在掌着舵，他的態度是閒逸的，靜適的。</p>
<p>「你知道這裹的水有多少深呢？」我問他。</p>
<p>「大約有丈五六尺深吧！」</p>
<p>「如果有人從這裹跌下去還有救嗎？」</p>
<p>「那說不定，運道好的就會遇救，運道壞的就算完了！」</p>
<p>「我想會游水的人總要比較好點吧！」我拿這句話去駁那個唯命論的老者。</p>
<p>「那是當然的。」他閒逸的答着，他不知道他自己的話已經發生矛盾了。</p>
<p>和汽力的巨輪，用風力的帆船，用人力的小艇，在浦江中雜陳着形成了一幅新舊交織的圖畫。</p>
<p>貪看了兩岸的美景，便感覺不到獨自旅行是寂寞了。最後還是笛汽的聲音，報告我船已到了旅行的目的地「六里橋。」</p>
<p>從狹小的斜坡上走上去，經過狹小的市鎭，找到Ｂ校。我着門人進去給梧通報，說我來看他了。</p>
<p>梧是我在Ｈ城認識的一個朋友，他最近來到Ｂ校服務，他給我信說他現在敎書的生活太機械了，他希望我能够去談談，並且看看浦東的風景。</p>
<p>我守候在辦事室裹，一刻兒，梧就出現在我的眼前。我看見他仍然是那樣的活潑，矯健，和從前沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>「樓！你來了嗎，我們已經有一個很長的離别的時期呢。」</p>
<p>「大約有三年吧？我恐怕變化得使你不能認識了！」</p>
<p>「三年多了呢！不過除過你手裹多添一根手杖之外，我看不出你有其他顯著的變化。」</p>
<p>我們都笑了！</p>
<p>梧邀我到裹邊去談，我們走過校園，綠草如茵的地上建立着一個銅像，我問梧才知道這是一位毁家興學的敎育家。</p>
<p>我們在裹邊談了很多關於各人别後生活情形的話。</p>
<p>「梧，你說浦東風景很好，我們到外邊去遊遊好嗎？」</p>
<p>「好的！」梧說着便導我走出校門。</p>
<p>行過一段矮小的市塵，便到了鄉村區域。沿江的農田是肥美的，還有聚江流而成的大湖，水淸如鏡，游魚可數，我們沿着隄岸行走，恍若置身西冷橋畔。</p>
<p>「我有時帶學生到這裹來寫生，這裹的景物是很平凡的，我想你看見是定要失望！」梧說。</p>
<p>「你以爲它是平凡嗎！但在我看起來已經覺得很滿意了。」我這樣答覆着梧，停了會兒我又說：「這裹就是缺少山色，其他的部分都很齊備的。」</p>
<p>「其實我們已經飽覽了大自然的風景，何必再投到那粉飾的圍牆裹去！····」我說。</p>
<p>我因爲時間已經不早，同時感覺到有點飢餓，便和梧到鎭上的小肆中嘗了本地的風味，隨卽和梧怱促的握别。</p>
<p>歸途是由浦東的南碼頭下船的，在下午三點鐘的時候，我又回到了烟霧瀰漫的上海了。</p>

<h3 id="c178">宮刑及其他 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>明人柯維騏撰宋史新編，因爲要專注思慮，便發憤自宮。但也有人說他是想摹擬司馬遷，所以不但在文章求其相像，便是境遇，也得「如法泡製」。　　柯維骐像不像司馬遷，我不大淸楚。但一個作家對於他的境遇，倒是不容忽視的。史記也確有受富刑影響的地方，不過這並不是說沒有生殖器便寫得出好文章。而問題倒在於平日自視淸高，一旦横遭宮刑，這些牢騷便覺得按捺不住，發爲文章，難免有些激昂。但如果自己去宮了一下，　子也許眞的會脫落，聲音也許眞的會尖銳，倘說是這樣便寫得出史記來，倒也未必見得。　　不但自宮是如此，便是被宮，也還是不會見效的。歷代都有太監，而不曾都有史記。卽使有史記，也不是出諸太監之手。</p>
<p>受宮刑可以作好文章，在中國試騐已經失敗。這回是希特拉先生忽發雅興，要有宮刑來治國了。據說凡患瘋癲，梅毒，神經衰弱，以及犯罪行爲的，都得消滅其生殖機能，換一句話說，便是施行宮刑。這種法律從今年起已經實行，例如路透社六日柏林電：</p>
<p>消滅生殖機能新律，已自本年一月一日起發生效力，當局現正積極厲行。今日普魯士西里西亞之哥爾里資庭，將被控犯鷄姦糼童罪之五十四歲工人一　　名，判處徒刑一年，並施宮刑。</p>
<p>這種盛事也眞値得謳歌。只要輕輕一刀，便已萬事俱全，不但終此一生不會再犯此罪，便連子子孫孫，也都給安排定當了。人民的鰥寡曠怨，窮困顚沛，一切後天的引誘脅逼，這與希特拉先生的德政絲毫無關。梅毒，瘋癲，神經衰弱，以至犯罪行爲，都是先天的遺傳，而應該歸罪於爹媽。所以罪人一宮，天下太平，偉矣哉，希特拉先生也。</p>
<p>中國去年好像在提倡解决監犯的性慾問題，這在希特拉一輩人看來，多少終是危險的事，說不定就此會生下一批强盜竊賊來。可是中國人却並不擔憂。　　這理由很簡單。好文章使人頭痛，只要寫不出好文章，也便不必宮刑，至於生出一批强盜竊賊來，那倒底是後一代的事。</p>

<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>吾夙好治學工具之書，而今日學界所最需要者亦莫如治學工具之書。古之所謂通人者，通於經史義理詞章之學而已。六經皆史，寳釐定　早已言之，然六經又何嘗非皆文，經學史論又何嘗非皆義理之學？槪而言之，儒者之學而已。間或别出專門，如顧亭林之精輿地，戴東原之精數學，段玉裁之精小學，錢大昕之精元史，龔自珍之精蒙古文，亦皆以經史之附庸視之。蓋古人爲學雖極繁賾皆融會貫通於方寸之内，以腹爲笥。凡有疑難，不能於腹中檢得，或遇有典故，不能立指其出於禮記某篇，史記某傳者，卽不足爲通人。當時風尙，遺辭以高深爲貴，以淺近爲陋，用語以僻奥爲雅，以易檢爲俗。是故雖有治學工具之書，亦不爲通人所重視。然自今人思之，實覺無謂；古人治學精神雖可嘉，然其所慮糜之光陰實太多。我國學術上，若無通志，通考及圖書集成經籍纂詁等有系統之著作可憑，則虚糜光陰不知又將何若也。况今日治學　非昔比，以腹爲笥，究不可能。福特有言曰，通人者卽遇有難題知就何書翻檢之人也。無論古今中外，治學工具之書，皆能指示修學門徑，節省時間，且可觸類旁通，引人入勝，其嘉惠士林，實非淺尠，不可以編纂不如著作而輕視之。辭源之出也，學界視爲福音，雖毁譽參半，然其節省吾人治學時間之功不可抺殺。此類治學工具之書，愈多愈好，惜今人懶，不可多見耳。余曩聞開明書店編十三經索引而心喜，今讀開明刋行朱丹九先生之辭通而心益喜：蓋此書出而國文敎師不必復爲學生所窘，如昔日之朱先生矣。其引證之詳博，搜討之精　，遠勝於辭源，而與經籍纂詁相伯仲。所不同者，纂詁以單字爲主，辭通以謰語爲主。纂詁成於衆手，辭通則爲朱先生一人畢生精力所成就。其著作精神，視朱駿聲蓋無多讓焉。所謂通者，通其異文之謂。古人用字每多假借，假借卽别字也。因古今異寫或方俗不同，一字常有異文，如吉　爲　，或作吉圭，有覺德行，亦作有楷，　　文王，又作勉勉。甚或人名地名亦無一定寫法，西施亦作先施。計兒亦作計然，計倪，計　，計硯。汶山卽係　山，岷山，　山，蒙山。同是史記，疱犧又作宓戲。同在漢書，包犧又作炮犧，伏犧，虙戲，宓犧，虙犧，宓戲。他如褻衣又作設衣，子規又作子巂，子鳺，子雉，子　，子嵨，鴸鳺，鷤鴶，鸓鳺。紛紜錯雜，漫無統記，於是學者苦矣。不有一書以通其異，卽使通經宿學亦難免碰壁，宜乎朱先生之受窘也。有淸以來，訓詁大興，而考異之學因爲學者所注重。然可僅限於一家，如李富孫之詩經異文釋，易經左傳公羊等異文釋，趙坦之春秋異文箋，馮登府之三家詩異文疏等及陳喬樅之四家詩異文考，皆其例也。其對於經史載籍文字通假作綜合之搜羅者，如明方以智之通雅（釋詁），淸吳玉搢之别雅，錢坫之十經文字通正書，及阮元等之經籍纂詁（各字條末）等。其餘零碎散見材料，凡小學之書幾無處無之，若王疏廣雅，郝疏爾雅，經義述聞，十駕齋養新錄等。然未有如先生書之集其大成者也。其書雖以謰語重言二字者爲限，而單字假借已大半容纳其中，若古書夷遲通，可見於馮夷，凌夷，倭遲條，夷又與雉，薙通，可見於辛夷條。其引證之詳博，如陵夷引二十六事，陵遲引五十六事，又凌遲三，凌遲一，陵遲三（卷二·頁二五至二七）；又另條陵夷引六事，陵遲二事，棲遲一事；又加條陵夷一，陵遲一；逶迤作威夷，逶夷，蜲　，委蛇，逶虵，褘　，逶隨，委佗，委它，　胰，逶移，猗移，委維，延維，逶陀，逶蛇，委遲，遺蛇，逶迱，委移，委陀，逶迂，　迆（卷二，頁一Ｏ四至一Ｏ七），倭遲，威遲，倭夷，威紆，郁夷（卷二·頁三六）共七十四條，誠可謂蔚然大觀矣。凡此搜羅所得，實爲中國文字學上之基本材料。昔英人著牛津大字典，先事搜羅材料至二百萬條，而後英文各字在歴史上之用法，形體，演變，皆瞭如指掌。朱先生以一人精力，成就如此，使人驚歎。就此書中，作楷書形體之研究可，作音聲演變之研究亦可，要在能分時代地方之系統耳。如上舉凌　條，見於碑銘者，卽可研究。「遲」字見於漢韓勑碑，張遷碑，唐龍鑫道塲銘。逶迤條下，威给見於晋陶潛　上畫贊，褘　見於漢衛尉衛碑，　隨見於漢成　令唐挾頌碑，逶維，延維見山海經。聲音之變，如夷遲古通（古ｊ音近ｄ）可以馮夷—馮遲，逶夷—逶遲，陵夷－陵遲，辛夷－新雉－新　等爲例。無論雙聲（變韻母不變聲母）　韻（變聲母不變韻母）皆可就書中求其匯通之理及其出處時地等條件。蓋此書在今日實爲我國文字學之寳藏，多方利用，是所望於善學者。</p>
<h3 id="c180">「怎麽辦」？ <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 吳似鴻女士</p>
<p>昨天冒着風到北四川路，去參觀某學校的學期終了的成績展覽會。我好似自己曾經學過美術一樣的像煞有介事的特别注意美術。的確，成績還不錯，雖然畫幅很少，張掛在小小的室内却蠻熱閙。參觀的客人也頗多，有幾位好似見過面，我還與一位穿黑大衣的男賓點了點頭。</p>
<p>一年來，忙着生病第一次走入健康的人羣中，美術的環境中，心頭彷彿有了一個新的波浪。但是我覺得我的心依舊在冰雪中。當我仔細地玩味着某幅畫的時候，突然走進一位相識者，他是那學校的美術部的指導員，他與我握手，且把我介紹給他的朋友，他說：這位是「ＭＩＳＳＸ，你看她的臉雖然很冷，但是我相信她的内心一定是很熱烈的…」我聽了他這幾句話，忽然懷疑自己起來，俯下臉瞧瞧胸口，想要看出自己的心究竟是冷的，還是熱的；可是胸前是一塊布，整件衣服的一部份，我忽然覺得可笑，我竟笑了笑。笑得我站着的一塊地也冰冷起來，過後我再望望身旁的週圍，空空地，一個人也沒有了，望望房子的那一角，原來人都在那一邊，他們聚精會神的在深味着他們頭上的一張畫，我也走了過去。美術指導員指手劃脚的在解釋着他高足的創作的畫意：</p>
<p>「這個母親，唔……這個窮母親，抱着好新生的孩子，還是養他呢，還是丢掉呢，她疑慮着，不能解决，所以題材是『怎麽辦呢？』</p>
<p>他的語句還沒有說完，參觀者的視綫一齊離開畫幅而射到我的臉上。</p>
<p>眞奇怪！爲什麽那樣地看我，難道我與那幅畫一樣？還是他們要我來解答這個「怎麽辦呢？」的疑問？若是我與那幅畫一個樣的話，那我至少還得抱着小孩才像，而我是一個人站着，我懷裹並沒有小孩，表情上也差得遠，我的臉不是如那位美術指導員所說的是冷的嗎？冷是一無動靜之意，如冰的一塊，就是說我刚才笑了笑，那末笑後所剩餘的總還是笑，而不致於是疑慮！</p>
<p>因此我想，他們所以望我，大槪是考問的意思吧，問而不答，實在有些失禮，其實當時已經失禮了，因爲那時我並不作聲。只是一張冷面孔，也許是帶點笑後的剩餘？那末後補起也可以，我就試試做文章吧！</p>
<p>「怎麽辦呢？」，怎麽辦呢？有了小孩，小孩是也和大人一樣要吃，要穿，要住，且得大人去照護他。我想那幅畫上的母親，一定是曾經有過錢，或是曾經做過小姐，她如今一個錢也沒有，自己個人的生活都難以解决，那來的錢去養活她的兒子？就是說她在萬難中得到了機會，找得一個職業，至少可以糊糊口，那末也不能抱了小孩去做事，若是她把她的兒子丢掉，兒子總是自己生的，從自己的肚子裹生出來的，是她與那一介男子愛的結晶她一定是捨不得孩子，她一定是把那個小孩當做寳貝，也許是生命，於是『怎麽辦呢？』的題材很切貼。如果那幅畫上的母親素來是個窮女子，曾經舂過米，掘過地，或是織過布，做過草鞋，那末她就用不着去疑慮，就是疑慮了，她一定會很容易的自己去解答，雖然同樣的小孩也要吃，也要穿，也要住。但她會給她自己的奶，給他吃自己省下來的飯，抱在懐裹同睡在如鐵一般硬的棉被窝裹，白天自己做着事，把小孩放在蒲蓆上，或是竹籃中，小孩吃一度，睡一覺，不舒服的時候哭一大天，母親做事來得及就怱忙的抱他一下，來不及也就算了，心理燥急的時候，駡一大陣，這樣扶養着小孩，死了也好，活了更好。若是她根本不願意養他的話，生下來時把他放在爛蒲包裹送到育嬰堂。在這樣的母性之下，我是用不着來解答她的難題的，根本無所謂難題在她的腦袋中。</p>
<p>畫中的母親啊！你不必再疑慮了，照着你自己的意思勇敢地做去吧！</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>兩個女人坐下來時，把她們的座位稍移動了一點。　　「你今天沒有出去過嗎？」羅蘭媽媽問。</p>
<p>「沒有。我老實告訴你們，我是有點兒疲倦的。」　　於是她像向哲安和他的母親道謝似的，追述她在這次小旅行和捕蝦的游戲中所得到的一切快樂。</p>
<p>「你曉得嗎，」她說，「我今早吃着我自己捕的蝦呢。眞好吃極了。假使你們高興的話，我們改天再去捕一回蝦……」</p>
<p>那靑年打斷她的話道：</p>
<p>「在開始另一回之前，讓我們第一回結束了好嗎？」　　「這怎麽說？我覺得第一回老早完了呢。」</p>
<p>「啊！陸太太，在我一方面呢，我在聖約安的岩西。」</p>
<p>她裝着天眞且狡猾的樣子；</p>
<p>「你？什麽呢？你找着了什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「一個女人！並且我和媽媽特地來問她今早有沒有」　　她微笑起來：</p>
<p>「沒有，我是從來不改變意見的。」</p>
<p>於是他把手掌開得大大的伸給她，她以一種熱烈</p>
<p>。他問道：</p>
<p>「越快越好，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「隨便你要什麽時候就什麽時候好了。」</p>
<p>「六星期好嗎？」</p>
<p>「我沒有什麽意見。我未來的婆婆以爲怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>羅蘭夫人衐着一個稍稍憂鬱的微笑回答道：</p>
<p>「啊！我，我是毫無主張的。我祇謝謝你看上了哲安，因爲你會使他非常幸福的。」</p>
<p>「我總盡九就是了，媽媽。」</p>
<p>陸太太第一次顯得稍稍感動的樣子，立起身，伸開兩臂擁抱着羅蘭媽媽，把她像不孩子一樣抱吻了狠久；在這種新的愛撫之下，一種强烈的情緒把這可憐的女人的受傷了的心都脹大了。她不能說出好這時的感觸。這是同時悲慘而又又甜蜜的。她失去了一個兒子，一個大的兒子，現在人家却給她一個女兒，一個大的女兒來塡補了這缺憾。</p>
<p>當好倆仍舊面對面的坐在椅子上時，她們彼此拉着手，一動也不動，互相注視着，互相微笑着，這時哲安差不多像是被她們遺忘了。</p>
<p>隨後她們談了一大堆關於　不久就到舉行的結婚所必須顧慮到的事情，當一切都决定了，商里好了的時候，陸太太好像突然記起了一件委細的事情一樣，問他們道：</p>

<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>翻開了今天本報的「業餘周刋」，在「自我職業介紹回音」欄中，看到一個極大的極刺目的字，—「無」。在無字底下又加着三個像救火鐘上打鐘的鐵錐一般的「！」號，旁邊還注着「救命」二字，一例的加着三個「！」。看了之後，不禁毛骨竦然，我似乎隠隠聽到有人在上弔，有人在投浦的聲音。及至看完了報紙，這「救命」二字的餘音，還在我耳中嗡嗡未已，迫着我不得不提起筆來寫這一篇雜感。</p>
<p>「失業」，這是二十世紀新字典裹最普遍而又最不通的一個名詞。也是對資本主義的病態的露骨的表現。</p>
<p>「業」怎麽會「失」？除了殘疾或自己不願生存的以外，每個人都有憑着他的兩手兩足，一付腦筋來向社會服務，以換取他生存的權利。這權利，誰都沒有資格剥奪誰，要是一個人無端被剥奪了從事職業的權利，就等於剥奪了他生存的權利。那些官家子弟，富室遺孫，靠先人做了幾任大官，刮了幾處地皮，或是陰謀豪奪，高利重借，積下不少造孽錢，於是過着那種窮奢極慾的狂放生活。「業」不「業」，固與他們無關，「失」不「失」，自更不成問題。他們原是社會上的寄和蟲，不能當他是正當的器官組織。獨是一般靠着自己的勞動以換取生存的大衆，却因失業而受到生之威脅，於是而有種種投浦上弔的慘劇發生。故「失業」兩字的意義，將不止是失業而已，而是「失生」！</p>
<p>然而這現象，正泛濫於全世界。</p>
<p>現在這世界上，除了蘇聯以外，又那一處不閙着失業的恐慌。「金元王國」的美國，現有失業人數一千六百萬，日本二百萬，意大利三百萬，卽號稱工業最爲發逵的德意志，據本月二十一日新發表的統計，已登記的失業人數爲三百七十七萬六千人，中國向無統計，一萬萬左右，大槪相差不遠吧！究竟這是什麽緣故呢？說是「生產過賸」。</p>
<p>生產過賸，不是好的現象嗎？有得吃的，更可以吃得好點，有得用的，更可以用得舒服點，這還不是好事？然而不然！這原是少數有錢人的事，與大衆是無與的。我們看到美國西北部荒災，災民連黑麵包都啃洷，而紐約商人却將小麥傾入海中，將棉花焚燬，就可知道。</p>
<p>人類是要生存的，人類是生成要勞動動的：失業誰所願意，失去「生存」，更有誰能願意？然而有一部分人逼迫着不得不「賦閒」，不得不投黄浦，吞鴉片，上弔，這又是誰的罪呢？</p>
<p>死的是已經死了，然而還賸有幾千萬雖然已被剥奪了「生存」的權利，而始還堅持要活着的人，又將怎樣幹呢？</p>
<h3 id="c222">一條被 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>—紀念長眠地下的父親—</p>
<p>十一歲的那一年，是初秋，我打定了進城上學，於是就有一種特别的凖備，要收檢一付担子。我除了把文具書籍勉强的裝滿了一頭，另一頭便僅僅擺了幾套土頭土腦的玩具，什麽小喇叭哪，什麽鍵子哪，什麽紙紥的獅首哪，顯然是不稱頭，那頭是那麽重，這頭却這麽輕。於是父親走近來說：「還有東西裝哪！四兒，快到你大哥那裹去拿來條被！早就告訴他了的，呌他墊出來給五兒拿去上學，去，快點去！」那麽快，四哥果眞就把被拿來了。</p>
<p>被，是薄薄的一條，面子是官布的，本來是白色，恐是年代太久了，却又分明成了褐黄。我本是在母親的懷裹烘着睡慣了，很是怕冷，就順手一把摸着被，是薄薄的，正想說話，父親先開嘴了：「五兒，這條被雖是薄薄的，棉絮却很好，你摸摸，這是你大哥上學的時候做的，二十多年了，還是這麽軟軟的，是一條好被！」</p>
<p>就是這麽樣，我把那條被帶進了城裹的高小。學校裹的規定，是兩個人合鋪，與我合鋪的那位同學，倒是帶的一條新被，必然的我的一條就做了墊褥，所以在那三年之中，我是不曾覺察到我的那條被，是好抑不好？到底溫不溫暖　　三年的高小結束了，再遠些到Ｃ城去進中學，也就再帶了那條被去。中學是睡單鋪了，我就墊也是它，蓋也是它，入學又正是初秋，有些同學問我晚上睡了冷不冷，我說不，年紀是那麽輕，一爬上床就鼾着勞聲了。然而氣溫一天天的低壓下去，雪天臨了，我終究幾番在半夜裹凍了醒來，這才開始對我的被發生一種感觸。</p>
<p>是某一天的下午，我獨自個溜進了發生一種感觸。</p>
<p>宿舍，把被仔細端詳了一番，是薄薄的，而且小小的，是咬開了一個被角，眞使我萬分驚奇，怎麽是黑的棉絮呀？然而當時的那種經濟情形，其窘迫眞使人有些不大相信，我那裹算得是在中學裹唸書呢？只有緊縮着頭，夜夜不安寗的緊縮着頭，好容易挨到了寒假。</p>
<p>回了家，我就告訴母親，父親又跟了上來說：「那麽軟軟的被睡着還冷麽？是一條好被哪！「我說：「眞是冷得睡不着！」「那麽你想要家裹這些鐵板一樣的爛絮被麽？」我說：「上學時再講吧　　畢竟，從此我也就沒再上學了。</p>
<p>十七年遠遠的投進上海的懷抱，是偷跑式來的，臨行之時，又只得肩起那條被，遠客他鄉，却竟沒有什麽感觸了，雖然有些夜眞冷得望着天窗發白。</p>
<p>爲了父親是那麽戀着這條被，「是軟軟的，是一條好被！」而且是大哥讀書之始，紀念物，我也就特别珍重的包着藏着，以備有機會時帶了回去。前番我就帶了轉去，恭敬的端給父親，父親說：「你倒還好，沒有把我的被失掉，我正要被蓋哪！」一手就接過去放在床上，老皺的臉微微的展開了笑容，好似得了一件寳物一樣。</p>
<p>如今喲，父親是去世了，永遠的離開了塵寰，永遠的長眠在黄土丘之下！被，那條被，我想定還保存着在，長壽的被呀，你竟比我親愛的父親，还長壽兮！</p>

<h3 id="c223">跑香檳 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>近來社會上流行着一句術語，由「拍馬」的含意流變出來的語句——「跑香檳」。望文思義，拍馬之人必須在馬屁股上用工夫，而跑香檳的人也得在馬屁股上用工夫，其類屬一。不過將拍馬二字改成跑香檳，便頓然感覺到「跑香檳」一語，比之拍馬來得「摩登」，將「拍馬」二字的意思形容得甚爲盡致。</p>
<p>「拍馬」，自然得拍，拍者必爲馬，不過拍了馬之後下文如何，不得而知。拍馬之人與馬的關係怎樣，爲發怒而拍馬，或者是無所謂的拍馬，則不甚明瞭。旣拍之後，是拍馬的人領受馬不服貼的一蹄，或者就此跑開，都不甚詳細。至於馬與拍馬之人在一拍之後，於世於人發生若何影響，那更在不可知之數了。</p>
<p>「跑香檳」一句則不然。我們要不是「鄕下人」而曾往引翔鄕或以前之江灣看過春秋季香檳賽者，便熟悉此中奥妙。跑香檳的人（按卽拍馬者）是與馬相依爲命的，馬一跌交，「跑香檳」者亦必隨之倒霉，或者到酆都城去遊歷也說不定，足見「拍馬」非同兒戲，時常是性命攸關的。馬兒跑得好，跑香檳的人也附着驥尾，共奔前程，若是風雲際會，一時也就扶搖直上，直干靑雲。這是「跑香檳」的人所以不惜勞瘁隨着馬奔波的目的。</p>
<p>因此，「跑香檳」的人之所以「拍馬」，絕無絲毫勉强難爲情存在，完全出自心甘情願。自然在香檳賽上能勝任的馬必是「來頭甚大」，絕非劣馬，劣馬普天下皆是，就値不得「跑香檳」人的一「拍」了。古時是千里馬常有，而伯樂不常有，而今不同，欲相馬而拍的「伯樂」，遍地皆是，其多如毛，而値得一拍的「千里馬」則鳳毛麟角，不可接近。因之常有「有馬必拍」的現象，那主未免肉麻。而不諳「拍馬」之術者，在「適者生存」的定例下，就不免被排擠，鬱鬱不得志。　　按之「跑香檳」的情形，「拍馬」者與被拍者，彼此都有目的，互相利用，已無以「拍馬」爲開玩笑，或無所謂的「拍馬」：偶爾有之，則屬於「幽默」之類，非可以與鄭重其事的「拍馬」同例而語。雖說「拍馬」者，與被拍者彼此利害關係，相互利用，但有時也有「拍馬」拍得人不舒服的時候，其原因不是「拍馬」拍得「操之過急」，被馬聳下鞍來，便是遇着一種生成不服「拍」的馬。不過不服「拍」的馬，乃生成骨傲，稱爲孽馬，早已隨世俗的演進，逐漸被淘汰。</p>
<p>「跑香檳」或「拍馬」旣已成爲社會的普遍現象，自然在社會上就起莫大的影響。我們一見到香檳賽上的好馬，與良善的騎師，在共同合作下，跑馬廳的競賽塲上，幾乎只有他的飛奔馳騁，若是將社會當作一個竸技比武塲時，這「拍馬」者，與被拍者就可見其縱横一時不可一世的情形了「跑香檳」者與被跑」者，在社會的競技台上，顯然是把「拍馬」當作一個歛財的方法運用着，許多「跑香檳」的人，你拍此馬我拍彼馬，都以跑得「頭彩」爲目的。這其間自必然有一些興亡盛衰優盛劣敗產生出來，不過這不要緊，雖然一般人錢被收了去，究竟「仲彩」的人是盛極一時，洋錢到手。</p>
<p>中國現在大槪是經濟恐慌的關係罷，人民僥倖投機之心特盛，爭買甚麽獎券香檳券，明圖萬衆恐慌中自己一人成爲「幸運兒」，關於民生大計也免不了反映出這一現象。因之而「跑香檳」之風亦愈益普遍，我這樣幻想：一旦「馬」不存在，這些「跑香檳」的「拍馬」者總不會縱横一時，而該例在被消滅之例。</p>

<p>— 綠蒂</p>
<p>我的一位朋友，他畫得一手好山水，然而他生性高傲，非極知己的朋友不能得他一鱗半爪，他的畫室之内，堆滿了臨本畫帖，而自己的作品都是未完篇的。朋友們問他那是什麽意思，他總是微笑着不語。他的怪僻的皮脾在友輩之間也沒有人尋根追底求他切實的答案。往往在他微笑不語的時候，取笑他還沒有尋到適合的臨本哩。然而—有一次，他飮酒醉了。滔滔不絕的講他學畫的經過，還說出了許多從前畫家的長短處。他狂笑，他快樂，我們從沒有瞧見過他那樣忘形的時候，我就重提了他不完篇作品的理由。他滿樽了一杯酒說：</p>
<p>「因爲我不賣畫，許多要求我的人遭了拒絕之後，他們竟選我不在家的時候，偸我的畫去。雖然我有時明知是誰拿的，却不好意思和他翻臉。現在我這許多堆着，恐怕拾垃圾的見了也要搖頭呢？」他笑着，表示他的計劃的高妙。　　過後他很後悔酒後失言，我也和他不見面了常久時間。</p>
<p>最近在棋盤街和他相遇。他挾着一大捲的紙包，興怱怱的跑路，我喊住了他問：</p>
<p>「又是一捲未完成的作品？」</p>
<p>「不，改變作風了！」</p>
<p>他拉了我到他家裹。趟進他畫室的時候眞使我驚奇了，那東一堆的臨本畫帖，西一堆的未完成作品，都收拾一空。代替牠們地位的都是不穿褲子的姑娘；畫桌上正鋪着一幅裸體的舞女。</p>
<p>他將挾下的紙包在桌端一放，指着那幅畫對我說：</p>
<p>「是不是改變作風？」</p>
<p>他從烟罐内抽出兩枝烟來，一枝授給我，一枝送上自己的唇邊，身體坐在畫桌上，一條腿支着地板，他的態度已完全改變了，一如他的畫一樣。</p>
<p>「很好，那畫送我補壁罷。」</p>
<p>「這不能，」他搖着腿，人家定畫的廣告，過一天我畫張海水浴送你。兩道白烟從他鼻孔中冲出來，在舞女的乳房上跳舞。</p>
<p>「山水不畫了？」</p>
<p>他搖掏頭。</p>
<p>「那兩堆未完成的大作呢？」</p>
<p>「送給拾垃圾了！哈！哈：」</p>
<p>原來因他怪僻的皮氣，被一家香烟公司的經理賞識了，聘他去畫香烟的畫片，但是他的精心傑作，除極少數人點點頭外，不及美女畫片的被人什襲珍藏。經理先生識透了大部份是爲了畫片然後吸某牌香烟的，他見「硬貨」不受人歡迎，就商量我的朋友改畫裸女。起初他極端反對，寗願丢事不幹，後來經理允許他攺畫了裸女之後，銷路如不見增加，仍舊畫他的「硬貨。」</p>
<p>於是他改變作風，不必說得是「一紙風行。」那項畫片在吸烟者竟像古玩般的珍藏起來，自然香烟的銷路也風行全國。</p>
<p>我的朋友見改變作風成功萬歲，就放棄他畫山水時的怪僻，他努力於他的裸體畫片，可說畫肉感之能事。他畫月份牌；日曆，廣告畫，一切…祇要有人請敎他，無不樂從的。</p>
<p>然而—我不信。我每天抽烟，我每天讀廣告，從沒有被裸體畫片所誘惑而放棄我每天所抽慣的「老牌。」如其以我個人作單位，什麽肉感香艶等是無濟於事的。今天却給了我個明顯的事實，尃飾雍容富貴的電影皇后爲了改變作風而犠牲色相，據說是上下客滿。可見「裸」是無上的成功術。從今日始，我立誓改變作風尃寫肉感文章！</p>

<p>— 子林</p>
<p>同中國文壇闊别了許久了，現在閒着無事，就首先跑到四馬路的文藝市塲去巡禮。</p>
<p>新出的書和雜誌，的確比以前多得多了。新起的作家們更是多如牛毛。至於封面則更同四馬路的摩登姑娘一樣裝飾得這樣奢華令人目迷五色。但翻一翻他的内容，却又空洞得可以。</p>
<p>自從日本人把有計劃的經纃譯成「統制經纃」以來，這「統制」顯然也在我們古國流行起來，就是在文藝界也顯然可以看得出這種「統制」的趨勢。在這樣素來就在不景氣當中的中國，讀者的數目總是停留在一個很小的限度，同時作家之羣，又不絕的加多，因此就不能不「統制」一下。在每一種雜誌的周圍圍繞着許多小鷄仔般的作家之羣，無論做得怎樣狗屁的文章，通通都放在一道，然後再由外面拉一二篇「名家」的作品來做做廣告，接收一二篇由外面送來的不能不收的稿子，算是外來的投稿，於是乎編輯就告成功。作家之羣因爲有了這樣的「統制」就希望多得一些稿費，多拉一點錢，從讀者的袋子裹搬到舞女的袋子裹。</p>
<p>但是旣然化了六七毛錢去買什麽小說和詩來看的讀者們，大多數同時也就是自己夢想着升爲作家，而變成小鷄仔的後補之流的人物。因爲這樣不特可以成大名於一旦，而且可以拉回一點買書的本錢。但是許多的大雜誌都已經給「大作家」們統制着了，所以他們就不能不另尋出路，組成了所謂無名作家之羣。他們只是左來一棝雜誌，右來一個雜誌。給這些無名作家擠來擠去，於是大作家的「統制」也就尙未成功！</p>
<p>目前許多大作家的呌苦和感傷，原來大半也就是這種憂悶症Ｍｅｌａｕｅｈｏｌｉａ變態！</p>
<p>不過最近又有些人在提倡着「淸剿」了，當然淸剿不過是統制的另一面。統制是在暗中進行，所以市塲究竟還是一個市塲「野火燒不盡春風吹又生」野火其如春風何！</p>

<p>編者先生：我現在年三十五歲，我的父親在我十六歲學業時，不幸逝世，現在母親持家。父母所生我們同胞四人，我的哥哥大我三歳，在二十四歳未婚時，不幸夭亡。現在僅存我兄弟妹三人。我弟去秋已經完姻；我妹年僅雙十，未曾許字。弟與我同業，每月可賺八九元。我家中尙有田產十餘畝，所出糧食，每年可敷開支。我本人每月薪資十六元，三份之二供給家中，祇膡四五元在外零用。應酬人情，添補衣服，以及每年返家川資，亦在此中支用。我妻生有三女孩，家中一年到頭，除食住而外，寸布分文均皆不管，仍在我三份之一的薪資中剥削，還有意外生枝的侵耗，我實在拮据極了。現在我母親還在閙着她們的鬼胎，反說我私蓄頗豐，吃人家潮的，拿人家乾的。說我們在外，要用什麽錢哪？惟我兄弟在外，一切的一切，她全不追究，惟獨與我爭長論短。我並非自稱，亦頗知人情，爲人應負天職，俗說天下無不是底父母，各事委曲求全，避免惹人恥笑。我遠阻山河在外的人，耳不聽心不煩，她們婆媳姑嫂妯娌之間，不但不能互相扶持，且有乘夥譏刺，甚至指桑駡槐。我妻在家有三孩牽累，比較她們，做事之中，不無落後事所難免，因以時常爭吵不安。我在外時常耳鼓中貫滿了這許多風聞，弄得心緒不安，倘使一旦成痼，内外兩敗俱傷。若說分居，猶恐不允，左思右想，毫無良策，請求先生早的搭救我吧！敬祝撰安，履名書謹上。</p>
<p>編者按：如其履君的經濟力量，能够獨立的話，我們贊成他獨立門户，組織小家庭。她們雖會駡你不孝，責你遺棄老母，但是家產的收益，足以維持她們的生活，在法律上，在良心上，都可以自慰。不過履君的收入，月僅十五六元，而家有一妻三女，最近的將來，或許還會增加食指，照事實上看來，獨立門户，也要發生問題。在經濟制度沒有打破的社會裹，說也可憐，連父母子性之間，竟也免不了受經濟的支配，那麽你可懸兩個希望，免得被悲歡與短見所襲繫。第一個希望，就是你收入的增加。努力與經騐的結果，這是很可能的一件事，收入增加之後，供求適應，無往而不利。第二個希望，就是天下無不散的筵席，這種大家庭的牽累，爲日無多，而此後自已可以發揮的日子正長也。此外我們知道，世間不諒解的事情，大多出於誤會，母子之間，倘能開誠佈公，决不會有不能解釋的誤會。履君對於他夫人，也可將上列兩個希望，反覆開導，恐防在這極短的隠忍期間，因爲小不忍而發生意外也。</p>

<p>過後我對他們有一段解說：</p>
<p>「你們不要對我估量得過分好，也不要以爲過分壞，我是不壞也不好的一個人！你們應該要曉得我是同你們完全一樣平凡的人——這樣才好，應該如此看我才好。假使看我過好，未免使你們失望的地方總有，看我過壞也是不對的。總之我是同你一樣的人，勇氣不是完全沒有，但不很多，犠牲的時候有，也有不願犠牲的時候；抛開個人利益的時候有，也有不忘掉個人的時候——但我想到就說，所以就有前後的矛盾，以前的話以後不能行了——我們就是這樣的人，還不能完全抛掉自私自利的心；我們還在克服的過程中。</p>
<p>「並且老實說，你們不要希望人家給你去享受——這世界全是你們的，却要你們用力量去得來！」</p>
<p>他們看得我太好了，這好是建築在我給東西他們吃這基礎上，但是豈能完全公開公攤呢，——照現今已經自己祇能吃到五分之一了。</p>
<p>這常是我們與他們生出裂縫來的緣故——因爲這個基礎是靠不住的。他們是很難了解我們的，而且他們不想了解我們。他們最多祇能曉得我是一個好人，而不懂得我的思想。這是我悲傷的事—</p>
<p>有錢的政治犯眞難，十次的要要求同他買了九次，一次不買給他全部都會忘掉而且恨你，那感情正是難得會完全溶洽。窮的政治犯就不如此，所以往往得到一般犯人的信仰。</p>
<p>十日</p>
<p>這裹的人，同鄕的友誼很深，家鄕的隘窄觀念甚盛，而且他們走得越遠，同鄕觀念越甚？這種趨勢是因他們越入陌生的環境而愈顯孤獨的程度相增加的。這是基礎於互相帮助吧。</p>
<p>十一日</p>
<p>我打一報告要求做工，拿缺少活動爲理由，二科長批下來說——「本監每日規定必有運動時間，何得再求運動？」</p>
<p>但天呀，整整的有一個多星期沒有運動了，很多可以運動的日子放棄了，塲乾了，他們也只作不乾；我們關着的犯人又不能去看看塲他們不來開門不來帶出去又不能喊誰，我們的如何只有隨他們的良心——假定他們有良心——怎樣就怎樣。但是他們的良心只爲了自己的安閒着想，一千多個犯人身體缺乏活動的苦悶和將來會衰弱是不管的。</p>
<p>每次的運動時間最多是十分鐘，這樣長的時間在他——帶運動的看守長——是莫對犯人不知要怎麽去估計其價値的恩惠。衐得像十分鐘那樣長，他的面部浮起微笑了，他對我們說這是對我們的優待。因爲他的良心覺到輕爽了。但我們往往在當科長之類的陪着參觀人走過號子面前的小鐵窗時會聽到說——「每天二小時的運動。」有時或者說——「犯人在吃飯時回號子，其餘的時間是都在操塲上的」</p>

<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>據說，歌德的「少年維特之煩惱」，和施篤謨的「茵萝湖」，將被搬上中國銀幕了。</p>
<p>但是，爲什麽這兩作品會被選中了呢？</p>
<p>在中國的自由主義的文學運動上，它們確是看很重要的意義的。郭沫若譯「少年維特之煩惱」，「靑年男子誰個不善鍾情，妙齡少女誰個不善懷春，」戀愛至上主義便成爲自由主羲靑年的敎條；「茵夢湖」的譯本，據說有三種以上，這是說明了它怎樣地被當時靑年瘋狂地實愛着。</p>
<p>世界大戰中中國新興资資產階級的抬頭，造成了自由主義的文學運動的社會基礎。所謂自由主義文學，在内容上是反對建的，幷且常有愛國主義與民族主義。反對封建社會，就得把封建的偶像孔老夫子開刀，在戀愛問題與婚姻問題上廣汎地表現出自由主義對封建社會的叛逆，因此，戀愛至上主義成爲自由主義的新文學的骨幹。卽在形式上，適應地亦要求着從古典的文體的解放，這就是所謂「白話文學」運動，和文章結構的近代化。</p>
<p>在這自由主義文學運動中，翻譯負起了打基礎的任務，「少年維特之煩惱」和「茵夢湖」便是很盡職的二者。我們得承認二者實曾很大地影響着中國自由的主義文學作品的。不過，我們覺得，在現在，同「五四」時代已間隔了好幾個高　的現在，這兩部作品已失去了其意義。</p>
<p>我們固然仍要批判封建勢力，但已不是站在自由主義的立塲上來批判了；在社會主義的觀點去批判封建社會是現在我們的課題。</p>
<p>固然介紹世界文學名作這一切計劃，是非常値得贊美，而且我們也十分期待着我們的影壇能够在這方面努力；但我們絕不能把塌影的敎育使命看過；眞正從文學史的觀點來看，除了說明產生這文學作品的社會根據，及其在歷史上的地位之外，也要論到作品在現在的意義，我們對它應取的態度，（因爲這是文學史的任務。）所以，在想把文學作品搬上銀幕之前，應該鄭重地估量一下這作品對社會的反作用，我們究需要不需要它？</p>
<p>我們知道，「唐·古訶德」這樣的第一流名作，一到中國來的情形，是這樣的：只開映了短短的四天，便悄悄地溜出了上海。不是電影院老　敵視「唐·吉訶德」；也不是在開映前缺少普遍的宣傳，「唐·吉訶德」的文學史上的地位就是最有力的宣傳了；更不是電影批評界在開映後不好好地推薦給觀衆，柏勃斯脫和夏里賓的藝術曾被詳細地檢視過；倒是「唐·吉訶德」的沒落時代的悲哀，不爲一般的觀衆所瞭解的綠故。　　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c231">評「紅粉鐵血」 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 逸羣</p>
<p>Ｉ　ＷａｓＡ　Ｓｐｙ</p>
<p>｜Ｉ光陸蘭心映｜</p>
<p>一九一四｜一九一八的世界大戰，是由於全世界各帝國主義者掠奪市塲，爭搶殖民地的行爲所引起。什麽爲祖國，爲人類，爲公理正義而戰的口號，也早已證明，都無非只是些少數帝國主義者的欺人之談。</p>
<p>然而不幸得很，在繼續着這一空前的殘酷的劇戰崦醞釀着行將爆發的第二次更猛烈的大戰的現在。居然還有人憧憬着參加這一大戰的恊約國，是爲了「人類的同情與羲憤」，這不能不說是一種嚴重的錯誤。</p>
<p>關於這，從英國高蒙公司的「紅粉鐵血」一片中，我們可以看得非常的明白。</p>
<p>它叙述一個比利時少女馬麗莎，在一九一五年大戰方酣之時，見前線運回受傷兵士之慘痛情形，她不顧父母的勸阴，種族的異同，毅我决然地「本悲天憫人的微旨，激發人們的同情與義憤」投入德軍後方醫院爲看護，旣而見德軍之種種殘酷，益爲憤慨，乃加入聯軍偵探部爲間牒，出生入死，帮助聯軍，後雖事洩被捕，但爲同黨中的情人自首，得免於死，迨蘇格蘭軍開抵比境，始獲重覩天日。</p>
<p>故事的中心，很明顯地在爲他們老牌的帝國主義向全世界人民宣示着：　　一，只有我們大英帝國的軍隊，才是爲人類公理正義而戰爭。</p>
<p>二，只有在我們大英帝國的統治下，你們受强暴的弱小民族，才有重覩天日之日。</p>
<p>英國片而爲英國宣揚，這是爲祖國，原無可議，但怕的是我們的同胞，受了這一宣傳的影響，被麻醉了或者给欺朦了，因此，我們特指出，只有站立民族的立塲，被壓迫者的立塲的反帝國主義，反帝國主義掠奪市塲，爭搶殖民地的戰爭，是値得英勇地參加，値得特别地讚頌的。</p>
<p>再，關於這「紅粉鐵血」的製作方面，我覺得除了少數塲面，如挖地道，炸軍火庫以及街頭上聯軍偵探的秘密接頭等，太過於戲劇化以外，其他從導演以至於表演，都臻上乘。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c232">靑春之火觀後感 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 邵啓楣</p>
<p>從「靑春之火」中，發現了和其他作品所共有的三大通病：</p>
<p>（一）電影作品裹，主角固然重要，但配角所表演的，也要「恰如身份」方够得稱個配角。但是因爲大多數的製片家眼光短視的緣故，除了導演幾個主角！不外是漂亮的姐兒哥兒！之外，其餘的角兒，凑凑而已！「靑春之火」中蘭芬的母親，就極其笨拙，呆滯，僅能受傀儡式的牽動，有人說：「電影是社會生活的反映」。那末，中國電影所反映的社會？祇有風流倜儻的姐兒哥兒，和笨拙滯呆的老年人而已。</p>
<p>（二）大槪製片家要顯示他們東家資產的富厚，所以他們描演的题財的中心，是故意寄在一輩「高等華人」身上的。影片中的屋内置景，除了偶然不得已地採取些貧民窟的景物之外，其餘差不多都是高等華人所享用的歐美化的設備。中等家庭的置景，是很稀見的。譬如蘭芬家中的堂皇的建築，和富麗的設備，是很出人意表的。卽使蘭芬家中，果有那樣的富麗，但何至她的母親又那樣的寒酸？相如訪孟先新居的一會，旣不坐車也，沒有僕從，隨裳便服老媽子般的追隨在女兒的後面。雖說富有的也許可以儉樸，可以謙卑，但電影貴乎有現實性，當然牠所演出的，也要現實能容納纔好哩！</p>
<h3 id="c233">評「鹽潮」 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>通常我們看過國產影片後，總有一種「不眞切」的感覺，演員的表情方面，不是失之於呆板，就是失之於過火，或者增加許多不需要的塲面，而將有用的塲面倒省略了。</p>
<p>可是在「鹽潮」中，却沒有這些缺點，牠取材是很眞實的，而其中各個演員的動作，又都沒有理想化。（國產影片内，常有許多將其中的人物太理想化了，這實在是它們失敗的惟一原因。）</p>
<p>在導演方面，我們不能不承認徐欣夫得到很大的成功。其中關於阿鳳（胡蝶飾）前後情緒的轉變，描畫得維妙維肖，如送瓜時之遲疑不進，在羣情憤激中移步到一條掃帚（？）旁邊去用力的撕那葉子，以表現她當時心中的悔恨，都是很好的。</p>
<p>在攝影方面也很好，有許多優美的畫面令人神往；尤其是燒鹽塲中，光綫的配合，與鏡頭的角度，都好極了！</p>
<p>在演員方面，以飾阿鳳的胡蝶與飾阿巧的顧梅君爲最成功，阿鳳之溫柔敦厚，阿巧之天眞爛漫，都很自然，很眞的表現出來。其餘如陳炳生（王徴信飾）之崛强，張德三之（王夢石飾）之小心謹愼，表演得也算不差。</p>
<p>但有幾個小缺點：</p>
<p>一、陳炳生之病毫無病容。</p>
<p>二、捕張德三的僅有鹽警一人，似嫌不够。</p>
<p>三、李大户家中的陳設及宴會時的佈置太富麗堂皇，恐不適合鄕下的情况。</p>
<p>總之，此片結構嚴密，劇情緊張，尤其是最後用熊熊的火燄來作結收，更使觀衆得到一種深刻的印象。</p>
<h3 id="c234">觀「鹽潮」後 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 壯游</p>
<p>（上略）在「鹽潮」中，我們看到鄕村的貧乏，鹽民生活的困苦，它又暴露出都會惡少的狡猾，壓迫階級的剝削，和土豪劣紳與貪官污吏之狼狽爲奸。所以在意識方面「鹽潮」是十分充實的。</p>
<p>編劇者爲增加劇情的曲折，在片中插入一個愛情故事，亦甚得體。</p>
<p>演出方面導演徐欣夫已較從前大爲進步，對劇情的訴述，畫面的處理，都其整潔，適當，鏡頭角度的控制亦很靈巧，可惜片末大爭鬥一幕的高潮，情感與空氣皆嫌不足。</p>
<p>演員們的成績都不差，尤以顧梅君進眇得更快，把鄕村少女的天眞爛漫都發揮出來。（下略）</p>
<h3 id="c235">評「靑春之火」 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 羅亭</p>
<p>天一自認爲一九三三年的冠軍作之「靑春之火」，成績雖然沒有和他們自己所宣傳那樣的「詩一般的」美感，但是確也含有一點美的成分。從故事講，是現實的；從演出講，是健全的；從意識講，是正確的。</p>
<p>導演的手腕，；還够得上稱讚，有許多地方的暗示，用得十分恰當。他不是用赤裸裸給你看見你所希望能看到的東西，他用另一種手段給你自己去想像，那是十分俏皮十分聰明的。　　演員像陳玉梅那樣的天眞未鑿很令人滿意。葉秋心的動作雖然不十分純熟，但是面部的表情已有顯着的進步。余光還能配得上劇中主人翁的身份。其他的演員沒有甚麽可以値得說的。</p>
<p>至於佈景和攝影並沒有特别的偉大和特别鏡頭，但是大致還差强人意。總之「靑春之火」在國片的立塲上講是一本努力的進步的作品。</p>

<p>勤務兵近來報告軍心極爲憤激，請示辦法，志超吩咐道：「傳令给楊副官，要路局備車，本團明早一定開拔。」他說完了，就取下壁間所掛的軍帽，曼琳躍起抱住志超不放，志超猛推曼琳跌到地上，返身不顧的走出去。</p>
<p>故鄕——風景依然的故鄕，小芬抱着孩子，走回家門，可是桂生已不知去向。幸虧會到舊日的一個隣人指點着她，在一個土地廟裹找着她父親桂生，但是桂生看見了亿的女兒已經說不出话來了。桂生死後，她不斷的啼哭。忽然聽見廟外喧講之聲。又聽見什麽，「歡送二十六師出關殺敵！」「擁護保衛國土的六十八團！」</p>
<p>羣衆的興奮，個個都非常的熱烈，小芬出來看見六十八團的字樣，她的眼睛像是一亮，雜在羣衆的一隊小學生，又在高呼着：「上車站去！歡送打帝國主義的兵士，歡送拚命殺敵的李志超團長！」小芬聽到這三個字，立時怒上心來。她憤然的回身進土地廟，尋思張望，檢起一把銹爛的刀，藏到衣袋裹，抱着小孩出去。滿佈着歡送的羣衆的火車站，小芬抱着孩子也擠到歐呼的羣衆中。大家請師長訓話。師長說他沒有什麽話講，請本師最先要求上前線的李團長代表演說。於是李志超走到火車的踏脚梯上，羣衆的歡呼，小芬的切齒，志超很勇敢很誠懇地：「同胞們！承諸位這樣熱烈的歡送我們，我們除了感謝，祇有慚愧，歷來的軍人，實在是有些對不住给養我們的全國的老百姓！</p>
<p>小芬擠上一步，緊握着手中的銹刀。李志超又說：「可是，現在已是我們軍人向大衆贖罪的機會了，我們一定要用我們的鮮血，去和帝國主義拚命！」</p>
<p>羣衆歡呼鼓掌，士兵們也一同興憤的喝彩，小芬更是緊張，可是似乎有些感動。接着又說：「同胞們！這是我們最後的見面，爲着保障我們的國土，弟兄們沒有一個再想回來！記住！要大家起來！去打倒侵略中國的帝國主義！」</p>
<p>羣衆們大聲歡呼，老年的農民，有滴下眼涙的，也有人起來演講，小芬也深深的感動，低下頭去，沉思復沉思，已經是涕泗滂沱了，再抬起頭來，看看志超的那種誠懇而悲壯的態度，心裹簡直是摇摇無主，看看懷抱着的嬰孩，再看看手中的刀，慢慢的手鬆了，刀墜在地上了。</p>
<p>汽笛響了，火車在民衆的歡呼聲中漸漸的移動了，士兵們從窗口伸出手來不斷的揮着，起超也揮着手，羣衆們更是揮手揚巾想送，小芬恨着也舉起手來，滿臉的淚痕，但被大衆的歡呼聲，也引得好微笑地頻頻着揮動她的手。　　（完）</p>

<p>Fierce Fighting South of Shuikou</p>
<p>Central Army Advancing Rapidly Towards Fuzhou</p>
<p>Nineteenth Route Army Preparing to Retreat and Defend Zhangzhou and Quanzhou</p>
<p>Marine Corps and Fujian Army Still Engaged in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>In Pingyang Area, It Was Plainclothes Troops Creating Disturbances</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Provincial Government Secretary-General Lu Dai told reporters that since the Central Army captured Yanping, it has continued to advance. It has been reported that Shuikou has indeed been recovered by our army. The area was garrisoned by troops such as those under Qu Shounian and Tan Qixiu. There was fierce fighting between the two sides. The enemy was unable to withstand the assault and retreated from Shuikou, going downstream along the Min River. It is only two hundred li from Fuzhou, a matter of arriving in the evening after departing in the morning. Fuzhou will be taken in a matter of days. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) A certain military authority today declared to reporters that the war at the front is going smoothly. The bulk of the Central Army in northern Fujian surrounded Gutian from Yanping and Pingnan, directly attacking the county seat. The enemy army was unsuccessful in resisting. Because Tan Qixiu had defected to our side, the county seat was recovered on the evening of the 7th. Other units of the Fujian army retreated towards the vicinity of Fuzhou. The Central Army continued to advance that evening, taking advantage of the victory to recover Shuikou. The Fujian army was scattered and fled to Fuzhou. Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai, realizing that the situation was hopeless, left the Fujian base beforehand and reportedly went to Xiamen to escape. Only Cai Tingkai is supporting things in Fuzhou. The fighting south of Shuikou is currently very intense. The Central Army is in pursuit. It is confirmed that plainclothes units of the Fujian army are causing disturbances in Pingyang. In the Luoyuan area, the Marine Corps and the Fujian army are still engaged in fierce fighting. Taishou, Shouning, and Jun'an are all safe. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The Headquarters held a military meeting on the 6th and decided to redeploy the battle lines. All troops will be dispatched to engage the enemy. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Northern Route Headquarters reports that since our army exited Shuikou and Gutian from Yanping, the rear of the rebellious Zhejiang army has been cut off, and we can directly attack Fuzhou. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Military sources report that the 60th and 61st divisions of the rebellious army in Yanping, as well as Liang's brigade, have all retreated to the vicinity of Fuzhou. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Yu Feipeng Cables News of Shuikou's Capture =</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng was summoned to Jiangxi by Chairman Chiang some days ago to assist in the military campaign against the rebels. Yu telegraphed to Nanjing on the 6th, reporting that Shuikou was captured by our army's 囗 division on the 7th. The original telegram is as follows: Urgent. To President Wang and the Military Commission: Our 囗 division captured Shuikou on the afternoon of the 7th. The rebellious troops defending Shuikou were completely eliminated.

<p>(Hangzhou) Jianning telegram: Our army recovered Shuikou on the afternoon of the 7th. All the rebel defending troops were eliminated. Our army obtained countless supplies. Fuzhou can be taken within days. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Navy Lands Along Jinhua Mountain =</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) A certain important person said that after Chen Jiliang led warships to Sandu'ao in Fujian, the Marine Corps landed along Jinhua Mountain and engaged in fierce fighting with the Fujian army between Guxi and Bantian Guan. The Central Navy and Army plan to converge in the Gutian area. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Navy Engaged in Fierce Battles with the Enemy for Days =</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan said upon returning to Nanjing from Shanghai that the navy has been engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in Luoyuan and other places for days, and has been very successful. Military progress on all fronts is also rapid, and it is expected that the situation will be concluded soon. I originally planned to depart personally, but due to the heavy workload of the ministry, I have no time to spare. If necessary, I may go on an inspection tour, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Tan Qixiu Has Already Supported the Central Government =</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Security Bureau received a telegram from Lu Zhongxiu, director of the Quzhou sub-bureau, stating that according to a telephone call from Wang Chaofan, the county magistrate of Qu County, he received a message from the Transportation Office that Yanping had been recovered, that the rebel Tan Qixiu supported the Central Government, and that Fuzhou would be taken within days. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Cai Tingkai Organizes Ten Regiments of Peasant Soldiers =</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi received a telegram from the garrison in Wenzhou stating that, according to reports, Tan Qixiu of the Fujian side had indeed defected to our side. Our Liu Heding's troops surrounded Yanping. A part of the rebel army is negotiating surrender. The Nineteenth Route Army is shortening its defense line and plans to retreat to and defend Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. It is undecided whether Fuzhou will be handed over to the navy or the Red bandits. Cai Tingkai is organizing ten regiments of peasant soldiers. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= News from Fujian Province Received in Beiping =</p>
<p>(Beiping) News coming from Fujian Province is slightly chaotic. According to official circles, after fierce fighting, the government army has recovered Yanping. Other news says that the Nineteenth Route Army withdrew before the government army entered the city, apparently preserving its strength. It is said that the rebel army is now concentrated in the Fuzhou area, while the Red Army remains stationed in the south of the province. Therefore, the rumor that the government army has cut off the rebels' connection with the Red Army seems credible. Weng Zhaoyuan is currently leading the former bandit army to defend the Honglu area south of Fuzhou. According to news from Xiamen, the Guangdong army has re-entered southwestern Fujian near Shanghang to prevent the Red Army, because the Red Army has been gradually increasing in Changting and Liancheng recently. The movements of the navy along the Fujian coast are particularly unclear. Today, a Chinese gunboat sailed from Fuzhou to Xiamen. It is widely believed that the port of Xiamen will soon be controlled by the Chinese navy. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>= US Consulate Receives War News from Fujian =</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The US Consulate in Beijing received a telegram from the consulate in Fujian on the 8th stating that the Central Army has been successful in the fighting on the Fujian-Zhejiang border for days, and the Fujian army is retreating south. It is now confirmed that the Central Army has recovered Yanping and is more than 200 li from Fuzhou. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Foreigners in Fujian Attempt to Establish Neutral Zone =</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign News (1) The Fuzhou consular corps requested that the area around Cangqianshan and Fan Chuanpu be designated as a neutral zone, and that neither side be allowed to throw bombs or fire guns within the neutral zone. Our diplomatic authorities have not yet accepted this request, because our country is responsible for protecting foreign nationals. We have already notified the envoys of various countries in China, who have in turn notified foreign nationals in Fujian to move away from Fujian. We cannot allow the suppression of the rebellion to be restricted by foreigners designating a neutral zone, thereby restraining our country's politics. (2) The foreign nationals on Gulangyu Island in Fujian have organized an international volunteer corps. If it is only to temporarily protect the safety of the foreign nationals themselves, and has no other political purpose, our diplomatic authorities will not reject it. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Zhangzhou Troops Conduct Inspection =</p>
<p>(Xiamen) According to Shen Donghai from Zhao'an, Zhangzhou, a regiment was left behind in Zhangzhou. On the 7th, Zhangzhou conducted a major inspection to prevent soldiers and spies from infiltrating. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Panic Among Fuzhou Citizens Intensifies =</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign News: The Central Army is fighting in northern Fujian. Yanping has indeed fallen into the hands of the Central Army. The rebel army is retreating to Fuzhou. Wounded soldiers are being transported back from the front. Refugees from the war zone are fleeing to the provincial capital with their elderly and children. The security team inside the city is refusing entry. They are now all gathered outside the city, in a very miserable state. Wounded soldiers are causing disturbances along the way, and the order is extremely chaotic. Panic among Fuzhou citizens has reached its peak. The puppet government's police issue announcements every day to reassure the people, and fabricate battle reports to post in the main thoroughfares, but the people's hearts have not been calmed by this. Many are secretly moving their valuable property to the consulate area in Nantai to deposit it. The authorities are strictly prohibiting citizens from moving, but every time a foreign ship departs, it is full of passengers, which shows the general terror of the people. As for British and American foreign nationals, those who originally lived in the counties of northern Fujian have already left. Even the missionaries who reside in the city of Fuzhou have mostly moved to Nantai after being advised by their respective consuls. Housing in Nantai is in short supply, and profits are tripled. As for southern Fujian, although there is extreme tension, social order is still stable. In Xiamen, foreign nationals are also moving to Gulangyu Island. The Central Army has captured Yanping and Gutian in succession, and will first take Shuikou and then take advantage of the victory to attack Fuzhou. A certain military authority has already moved from the Pucheng field headquarters to Jianning to command everything. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>= Funds from Fujian Province are Being Transported to Malaya =</p>
<p>Singapore: Large sums of cash are currently being transported from Fujian Province to Malaya. This is unprecedented since the Chinese migrated to Southeast Asia. In the past, Chinese in Malaya would remit money to Fujian, but now it is the opposite. Those who have deposits in Fujian banks fear that their deposits will be confiscated, so they are remitting them to Malaya. Wealthy households in Fujian who have relatives and friends in Malaya are also remitting money here to ensure safety. At the same time, some overseas Chinese who had returned to Fujian in their old age to recuperate are now returning here one after another. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Their names have not yet been announced. Officials indicated that Li and Bai had telegraphed from Guangxi, agreeing to sign the proposal. Zou Lu today asked a Reuters reporter to verify the rumor that Dai Ji had defected from the Nineteenth Route Army and gone to Hong Kong, which proves that a major internal strife has occurred within the Nineteenth Route Army. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhang Ji told people that the rumor that a proposal regarding the Fourth Plenary Session would be first submitted for discussion by the Central Committee members in Beijing is absolutely untrue. Only I and three or five friends have made some preliminary studies so that the opinions put forward by all parties at the conference will not be too divergent and chaotic. As for whether a preparatory meeting will be held before the conference, nothing has been decided yet. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tao Shangming Goes to Tianjin</p>
<p>To Continue Negotiations with Nakamura</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Yuguan handover issue, Tao Shangming has been negotiating with the Japanese authorities repeatedly. The Japanese side's attached conditions to the detailed rules for the Yuguan handover are too harsh. After careful study, the authorities repeatedly cannot accept them, resulting in the delay. Tao visited Shibayama at the Japanese Embassy yesterday, and left Beiping for Tianjin this morning to continue negotiations with Nakamura, commander of the Japanese garrison. He will also go to the Tangshan Public Office, and if necessary, go to Yuguan again to continue negotiations with Iga.

The county magistrate has left office. The new county magistrate has not yet taken office. The city is only defended by the chief of the public security bureau. Yu Xuezhong transferred three infantry regiments stationed in Dacheng and Zhang Chengde's cavalry to provide support. Four to five hundred remnants of Liu's bandits are looting everywhere south of Gu'an and north of Dacheng. Local militias are on strict alert. (8th Dispatch)</p>

I have already telegraphed the cavalry stationed in Xianxian to track and suppress them, and telegraphed Han Fuqu to dispatch troops to block them. There is still a force of Liu's bandits in Renqiu, which is in conflict with the garrison and the militia. However, the forces there are weak, and it is far from Xianxian and Dacheng. It will take time for reinforcements to arrive, so the situation in the county is worrying. I have not yet finished my official duties and will return to Tianjin tomorrow night. (8th Dispatch)</p>

Just after leaving the station for about 4 kilometers, when traveling to the Black Tiger Pool area about 20 li north of Dawenkou, gunshots suddenly rang out on both sides of the road. The bandits on the train immediately became active, and ordered the engine driver to stop. At this time, about one hundred and several dozen bandits from the roadside swarmed out, bombarding the train. The driver then stopped the train. The 40-odd police soldiers of the accompanying security team were unable to fight back due to the overwhelming number of bandits. The bandits then boarded the train one after another, searching and looting the passengers' clothing, luggage, money, and bank notes. They also seized two Mauser pistols and two rifles from the security team. The remaining firearms were hidden and not found. Liu Zhairen, the squad leader of the security guard, and Tao Guangfeng, Wang Yueting, and Jiao You Li Letang were wounded. The dining car was shot the most.

According to the passengers on the train, the bandits also planned to intercept the Pinghu through train, but they had mistaken the time, so they mistakenly robbed this train. Passenger losses are estimated at about five or six thousand yuan. These bandits were mostly wearing tattered gray uniforms, and their firearms were quite complete. They may be remnants of Liu Guitang who have fled into Shandong Province. The Railway Bureau attaches great importance to this matter and has telegraphed Chairman Han to strictly arrest the bandits.

<h3 id="e16">The Current Crisis in European Politics <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The strained relationship between France and Germany, inherited from history, cannot be easily resolved in the short term. Moreover, France is vigilantly prepared, fearing that once Germany's military strength is restored, Paris will again be besieged. Therefore, it insists on "security guarantees," believing that if France's security is firmly assured, other issues will be easily resolved. On the German side, dissatisfied with the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles and deeply feeling the pressure of economic panic, it realizes that this economic panic cannot be broken in an instant, and it is not easy to find a way out through the economy itself. Only by opening a path politically can economic solutions be sought. Hitler took the destruction of unequal treaties as his rallying cry to enter the political stage. Therefore, he must resolutely insist that Germany cannot be left defenseless against its neighbors' guns. The demand for "equality in armaments" does have its grand justification.</p>
<p>Since Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the European situation has suddenly become tense. Because Germany's withdrawal will inevitably lead to its unilateral abandonment of the Treaty of Versailles to expand its military strength according to its own wishes. At this time, France would never stand idly by and would surely take up arms. At the same time, the small countries that are France's satellites would follow in France's footsteps and actively engage in military preparations. However, in this crisis-ridden and explosive situation, Britain's actions are crucial. Britain's traditional policy towards Europe is to prevent any single country from dominating the continent. Before the war, Germany was too strong, and Britain would take the opportunity to strike it down. How is Britain's attitude towards France any different now? Although Britain's pro-French inclination has not changed, the opinions of Britain and France differ greatly on relations with Germany, especially regarding arms reduction. Britain believes that after the end of the "trial period," if France cannot prove that Germany has violated the agreement during this period, then France has an obligation to immediately reduce its armaments. However, France insists that Germany must show sincerity in seeking peace and demonstrate that it has no intention of violating the arms reduction agreement before France can reduce its armaments. Even if Britain's view could be realized, Germany might not agree. Moreover, France still has this argument. Italy fundamentally rejects Germany's demand for equality in armaments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Fascist leader Italy, in theory and in practice, has not proven to be truly aligned with Germany to the end. However, currently, Italy is eager to develop its colonies in North Africa and needs hegemony in the Mediterranean. It wants to be the leader of the small countries in Central Europe, and of course, Italy wants to exclusively control the Adriatic Sea. Therefore, Italy also expresses dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles, thus indirectly sympathizing with Germany. The opposition between Italy and France is becoming increasingly acute, both at sea and on land. (2)</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the Soviet Union, which was formerly watched by all capitalist countries and is still regarded as important, and now has even greater influence. Previously, German diplomacy cleverly used its relations with the Soviet Union to restrain Britain and France. Therefore, even in a situation of surrounding pressure, it was still able to open up a political path for itself. Unexpectedly, after Hitler came to power, driven by momentary emotional impulses, he made relations with the Soviet Union extremely bad.</p>
<p>At this time, France realized that the Soviet Union had the potential to influence the European political situation, and that France's intention to defend against Germany would naturally outweigh its defense against the Soviet Union. Therefore, taking this opportunity, it signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. In early September 1933, former Premier Herriot, accompanied by representatives of the French government, went to Moscow and was warmly welcomed by the Soviet authorities. In mid-September, the French Minister of Aviation led three aircraft to visit Moscow from the air. Such actions by the current minister were unprecedented in the Soviet Union's foreign relations. This proves that the friendly relationship between France and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly close.</p>
<p>We can see the change in French foreign policy from Herriot's theory of French-Russian friendship. Since France intends to get closer to the Soviet Union, the small countries of Central Europe will naturally follow France's lead and engage in friendly relations with France. On the surface, this seems to be a symbol of the peace movement, but in reality, it is the eve of armed conflict. When arms preparation has reached its peak, such diplomatic maneuvering, at least, is to pay full attention to the development of the war crisis and is an extremely serious preparation for war!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The crisis is constantly developing there and is still adding new elements. We cannot but try to examine the place where the crisis erupted and the core where the crisis is latent. Everyone knows from history that before the World War, the Balkans were the powder keg of Europe. As a result, a bullet in Sarajevo triggered World War I. Now the situation has changed, and Europe has more than one powder keg.</p>
<p>Among those powder kegs, the issue of the corridor between Germany and Poland is the easiest to explode and the most dangerous. The so-called German-Polish corridor, on the Polish side, certainly provided an outlet to the sea, and Poland was no longer restricted by German imperialism. However, on the German side, the territory of East Prussia was forcibly separated. This is unbearable not only for the Prussian "Junkers" (noble landowners), but also for the general German population who harbor resentment. Moreover, German nationalism is highly developed, so the call to overthrow the Treaty of Versailles permeates all of Germany. This is the most urgent crisis in the European political situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, the relationship between the two Central European countries, Austria and Hungary, and the small Entente countries in the Danube region is entangled with ethnic issues, general political relations, and economic relations. France uses this to forge its hegemony in Europe, and Italy also wants to play a role at this time, so the problem becomes even more serious. At the same time, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania will never allow Germany's power to expand excessively. Although their existing strength is not enough to prevent the German-Austrian union movement, they can ask for France's help and Italy's cooperation, which is exactly what the two countries are about to do. Therefore, the disputes in Central Europe have added another explosive element. From the above brief description, we can see the complexity of the disputes and the seriousness of the crisis in the opposition between European countries.</p>

<p>— Speech at the Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>Private Armies Should Be Eliminated</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held the 112th Memorial Week at 9:00 am on the 8th. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Lifu, Li Zonghuang, Zheng Zhan'an, Xie Zuofa, Wang Qi, Zeng Zhongming, Ji Liang, and staff members, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting and made the following report:</p>
<p>Comrades, what I want to say today is just a very simple point, that is, about the rebellion of Chen and Li in Fujian and the feelings that have arisen from it. Since the September 18th Incident, comrades of our party have felt the seriousness of the national crisis, put aside all previous disputes, and advocated unity to jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and preserving its existence. In the past two years, although there are still various regrets about the effect of unity, the terrible civil war has finally been avoided. Although local conflicts still occur from time to time, the central government has always maintained an attitude of appeasement towards the localities and is unwilling to break ties lightly, because saving the nation and preserving its existence is more important than internal unity. In these two years, the use of force domestically has been limited to suppressing the communists, because the communists do not want the motherland and cannot be talked to about saving the nation and preserving its existence. When the Battle of Shanghai was urgent the year before last, the central government transferred troops from Jiangxi to support, but they took the opportunity to attack Ganzhou. When the war in North China was urgent last year, the central government transferred troops from Jiangxi to support, but they took the opportunity to attack Nanchang. From these two incidents, everyone knows that if we do not do our best to suppress the communists, then the work of saving the nation and preserving its existence cannot be started. Recently, Chen and Li rebelled in Fujian. Their goal is to overthrow the Republic of China and abandon the Chinese Kuomintang. Their desire to abandon the motherland is the same as the communists, so they resolutely allied with the communists. In fact, it cannot be said that they allied with the communists, it can only be said that they surrendered to the communists. The central government had no choice but to adopt the method of suppressing the communists to suppress them. At this time, some people advocated peaceful solutions, and some advocated a ceasefire. Their method of peaceful resolution was to have Chen and Li abolish the puppet state and puppet government, and at the same time have the central government reform the political system and what they called "the path of virtue should not be avoided." We can imagine whether this kind of advocacy is possible to realize. Are Chen and Li dissatisfied with the political system or with the people? If so, why did they have to abolish the Republic of China and abolish the Chinese Kuomintang? Therefore, the method of peaceful resolution will not have any effect on Chen and Li's side, but it will cause great danger on the central government's side, because today, Chen and Li's side wants to abandon the party and the country, and the central government's side wants to maintain the party and the country. In this struggle, if various reform plans are suddenly proposed, it is tantamount to causing internal turmoil in the central government, tantamount to responding to Chen and Li in order to carry out the plan to subvert the central government. If the central government is unfortunately overthrown, then the work of maintaining the party and the country will be eliminated along with it. This is such a great danger, so the four words "peaceful resolution" contain countless conspiracies and evils. All my comrades must deeply recognize this. In short, Chen and Li's rebellion cannot coexist with the party and the country. There is really no other way to save it except to do our best to suppress it. This is a palliative work. If all my comrades remember that we are saving the nation and preserving its existence and not suppressing Chen and Li who rebelled and surrendered to the communists, then of course they will not have any objections. What I want to say now is that in addition to these palliative works, we should further discuss a more fundamental problem. This problem is how did the 19th Route Army rebel? How did Chen and Li make the 19th Route Army rebel? In the 14th year, the 19th Route Army was a part of the National Revolutionary Army. In the 15th year, it was a part of the Northern Expeditionary Army. Since then, it has done a lot of work in suppressing bandits and resisting Japan. It was transferred to Fujian the year before last, and its only task was to suppress the communists. It was entrusted with the task of the East Route, hoping that it could cooperate with the North Route, West Route, and South Route to complete the plan of encirclement and annihilation. Its efforts have been like this, and its current task is also like this. Why does an army of the National Revolution openly do things that betray the National Revolution? Why does an army that suppresses communists openly do things that ally with the communists or even surrender to the communists? If it is said that it is due to the instigation of Chen and Li's ambitions, then why do all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army blindly and blindly listen to his instructions? According to this, if Chen and Li were to become emperors one day, all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army would stage the story of Chenqiao welcoming the Emperor in Yellow Robes. This phenomenon is very surprising, and what is the cause of this phenomenon? This is what we must carefully examine. Naturally, China has a vast territory, inconvenient transportation, and political and economic forces are not easy to concentrate, so military rebellion can occur at any time. However, the military organization is not perfect and the military training is not fully implemented, so the quality of the soldiers is poor and they are easily manipulated by the officers. As long as there are ambitious and ambitious officers, they can organize a cadre to drive the soldiers and make them become a private system. Today, they are soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army, flying the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, and tomorrow they are communist dogs, flying the flag of the Red Land with a Yellow Star. They can do anything. If this phenomenon and this cause cannot be eradicated, then the future of the Republic of China will have endless obstacles. Regarding this point, I think our comrades must have a clear understanding. If we do not pay attention to this and go to discuss what political system, I think it is ineffective. For example, recently some people have advocated opening up political power, and their purpose is to end political tutelage and start constitutionalism in advance. Some people advocate maintaining the party's dictatorship. In fact, these disputes were decided by the Prime Minister before his death. The Prime Minister advocated that political tutelage is an indispensable stage in the process of national revolution, because the national revolution must eliminate everything and build everything. Without political tutelage, it is impossible to concentrate political and economic forces. At the same time, the Prime Minister also explained the purpose of political tutelage and pointed out the difference between political tutelage and enlightened autocracy. The Prime Minister said that enlightened autocracy takes autocracy as its purpose, while political tutelage takes republicanism as its purpose. Therefore, vigorously implementing party rule and cultivating civil rights is the only way out for the national revolution, and there is no need to come and argue again. Now I won't go into details, but what I want to earnestly explain is that if private armies cannot be fundamentally eliminated, then constitutionalism cannot be realized, and even political tutelage cannot be realized. The existence of private armies is rampant and unscrupulous, then the so-called constitutionalism cannot be implemented, which is unnecessary to say. Why do I say that even political tutelage cannot be realized? Now some people feel the chaos of national affairs and think that if we can have a fascist dictatorship like Italy, it is not a way to revitalize and remedy the ills. But let us think about how many troops Italy sent before the fascist dictatorship, when it participated in the war? The total number exceeded four million. How many people died or were injured? More than 650,000 died, more than 450,000 were disabled, and more than 1 million were injured. And when the Fascist Party marched on Rome, the number of the so-called four legions, according to the opposition party, was only more than 10,000. Even according to Mussolini's autobiography, the number of Blackshirts who were armed after the successful march on Rome was only more than 60,000. And when the march on Rome, the government issued an order for the army to suppress it, but the army refused to obey, so the government collapsed, and Mussolini was ordered to form a cabinet to implement the policies of the Fascist Party. From this, we can see that before the Fascist Party's dictatorship in Italy, its army was used for foreign wars and not for internal wars. The change of regime in its country was based on the expression of public opinion, not on the victory or defeat of the army. Before the Fascist Party marched on Rome, the Communist Party occupied factories everywhere, destroyed traffic, and caused unbearable harassment, completely losing the sympathy of the people. The government was weak and incompetent, and hesitant, completely losing the faith of the people. Therefore, the army did not hinder the Fascist Party's march on Rome because the army had some common sense, so Mussolini could rely on it to implement his policies. If the Italian army at that time was like a private army, then some of them would have helped the government to attack the Fascist Party marching on Rome, and some of them would have helped the Fascist Party to attack the government. In this way, Italy would have been split and fought a big fight without end. How could there have been such an easy march on Rome? From this, we can know that if private armies are not fundamentally eliminated, not only will constitutionalism not be realized, but even political tutelage will not be realized. This is by no means an overstatement. For several years, some people have said that political tutelage has not achieved results. In fact, it is not that political tutelage has not achieved results, but that political tutelage has not started. The reason why political tutelage cannot start is because the above-mentioned obstacles have not been removed. This is what we are very sad about, and we cannot but admit it. If we see this clearly, then in addition to the so-called palliative work, we should work harder on the fundamental work. The so-called fundamental work is to improve military organization, strengthen military training, break the private system, and cultivate a pure and consistent National Revolutionary Army, which is certainly necessary. But what is even more necessary is to cultivate civil rights. The so-called cultivation of civil rights is not only to increase the political power of the people, but also to increase the economic power of the people. According to the national organization of modern people and its relationship in the world, the survival of the nation and the nation lies in economic self-sufficiency. The so-called political power is only used as a guarantee for economic power and to eliminate its obstacles. Therefore, the so-called civil rights should also focus on economic development. With economic development, the power of the people will naturally increase. Not only can they judge private armies, but also make private armies fundamentally unable to occur and exist. This can be said to be the fundamental work in the fundamental work. We must know that guns can certainly punish reaction, but they can also fundamentally eliminate reaction. I said before that there is no more urgent task than production and construction, and its meaning lies in this. Last November and December, our comrades suffered countless pains and oppressions in their hearts because of Chen and Li's rebellion in Fujian. From this pain and oppression, we have generated a kind of courage. We are doubly sincere and united, doubly clear about the doctrine, and doubly striving to implement it. In this way, we will be able to lay the foundation of the national revolution in this turbulent environment. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Kong Xiangxi Reports on Key Economic Relief Strategies <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>｜At the National Government Memorial Week｜</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi reported on the morning of the 8th, during the National Government Memorial Week, on the key strategies to alleviate China's economic crisis. He stated that recently, various countries are plagued by economic downturns, and our country, due to its underdeveloped industries, is less affected. However, with the depreciation of gold and appreciation of silver, our country, which has always had a trade deficit, will inevitably face increasing population and declining exports. Our country has traditionally relied on three factors to offset the trade deficit: firstly, remittances from overseas Chinese; secondly, investments by foreigners in business and industry in China; and thirdly, funding for missionary and charitable relief efforts by foreigners in China. Now that various countries are experiencing economic downturns, these capital inflows will inevitably decrease, and the economic downturn will gradually affect our country. We should prepare in advance to prevent disaster. Today, I would like to offer for your reference my personal research on China's economic problems, so as to achieve better methods and avoid social dangers. Currently, the largest source of central government revenue is customs duties, amounting to over thirty million yuan annually. However, due to the Boxer Indemnity, customs duties have been used annually to repay the debt since the 27th year of Emperor Guangxu's reign, and it will take another fourteen years to fully repay. Therefore, most of the customs duties are used to repay the indemnity. After the establishment of the National Government, the great powers expressed goodwill and returned the Boxer Indemnity, but most of it was designated as funds for cultural and educational construction, and the government cannot arbitrarily use it. In addition, some are designated as collateral for public bonds. Apart from these, the monthly surplus is only about five million. The second largest source of revenue is the salt tax, amounting to about one hundred forty to fifty million annually. However, tax rates vary across regions, ranging from one to thirteen yuan per dan (unit of weight). It is proposed to uniformly reduce tax rates above ten yuan to ten yuan to equalize the burden. After deducting debt repayments, the government receives only five million per month from the salt tax. Thirdly, is the consolidated tax. Since the implementation of the consolidated tax in the twentieth year, the largest sources of revenue have been from cigarettes and cotton yarn. Most yarn factories are operated by Japanese interests, with strong capital and advanced technology, coupled with the full assistance of their government, they are dumping products in China. In a few years, whether Chinese yarn factories can survive is highly questionable. Other industries such as cement and matches also face similar dangers. Currently, the monthly consolidated tax revenue is seven million yuan. The above three sources total seventeen million, plus another two to three million from various other taxes, the total monthly revenue is only eighteen to nineteen million. On the expenditure side, military and government construction require thirty-five million per month, resulting in a monthly deficit of about fifteen million, and an annual loss of one hundred seventy to eighty million. With such income and expenditure, at a time when the people are suffering greatly, even if we exhaust all resources, the gains will be minimal. For example, last year, we increased import duties on white sugar because it is a luxury item, but as a result, due to smuggling by unscrupulous merchants, the revenue was only 48% of what it was before. To prevent smuggling, a strict organization is required, but the country lacks the funds to establish such a customs enforcement force, so tax revenues are affected. Currently, financial difficulties are not limited to China; even in powerful countries, the amount of the deficit is alarming. The US President has proposed to increase the issuance of ten billion (US dollars) of US public bonds. If it were in our country, even one-tenth of that amount would be impossible to achieve. To make the country wealthy and the people strong, there must be a solution to the financial problems, and the people must be made prosperous. Currently, Chinese society faces immense difficulties. If we do not strive for relief, the economic downturn will spread within a year. Previously, gold was expensive and silver was cheap, and Chinese goods were cheap due to the use of silver, so we could compete in the world market. Because gold was expensive, foreign goods were expensive, and we could buy fewer unnecessary goods, resulting in less outflow of money. But with gold cheap and silver expensive, our exports will inevitably decrease, and imports will increase, resulting in a growing trade deficit each year. The social economy will truly be unimaginable. The Chinese economic situation is declining so rapidly that the way to provide relief must be to pay attention to economics, "Economic" relief to China's future crisis, tracing back to the source, we should promote thrift. In the past, life was very frugal. We hired scholars to educate our children, and the annual cost was only one hundred and twenty taels of silver. But now, educating children costs both the family and the government a great deal. However, the standard of living continues to rise. If the government does not seek relief, the people's lives will become unsustainable. Therefore, I propose the word "thrift" and ask everyone to practice it. The government should especially take the lead to set an example. The government's steps for thrift are: first, save on recurrent expenses; second, increase business expenses; and third, have rational construction. In recent years, people in our country have talked about construction, but construction without a plan is the same as no construction. For example, in recent years, the United States has experienced over-construction, overproduction, and uneven distribution, so the people's purchasing power has not increased, leading to economic panic. Other examples include coffee in Central and South America and sugar in Cuba, which are all overproduced and thrown into the sea. Now, when we talk about construction, if we do not have an overall plan and act rashly, the government will definitely suffer more than it benefits. Fourth, promote people's savings. France is a debtor nation, but the French have a habit of saving, and banks have a lot of deposits. People in our country not only do not have a habit of saving, but those with an income of one hundred yuan spend one hundred and twenty yuan, spending all their income and even falling into debt. Another group of people, although not wasteful, like to bury their money underground, hindering economic activity. Therefore, the government should promote savings and provide reliable guarantees. In addition, there is one more point, which is to promote dietary restraint. Foreigners have moderation in their diet, but in Chinese homes, tables are filled with dishes, especially in cities, where it is even more extravagant, spending dozens of dollars on a meal without hesitation. It is not an exaggeration to say that people eat themselves into poverty. We should quickly publicize the need to eliminate gluttony, and other forms of waste should also be prevented. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings require us to build the nation, and we should save and build at the same time, and it should be planned construction. In the past, Chinese politics followed Confucius's idea of ​​using the people at the right time, using the slack season in winter to carry out construction projects. Now, if we want to make the party and the country stable and strong, the first thing to do is to carry out rational construction from an economic perspective. China is an agricultural country, and we must start by helping farmers, building rural areas, and increasing production. Chinese farmers bear too heavy a burden. When I was Minister of Industry and Commerce, I strongly advocated abolishing the likin (internal transit tax), but after the abolition of the likin, local authorities increased additional taxes, so that the burden on farmers became heavier. Not only are they doomed to die in bad years, but even in good years, they cannot live in peace due to heavy taxes. Now, if we want to increase production, we must have a comprehensive plan to promote benefits and eliminate disadvantages. We must not only guard against deficiencies but also guard against surpluses, so that supply and demand correspond and are moderate. This will ensure that the economic downturn does not affect China.

<h3 id="e21">Kong Xiangxi Returns to Nanjing with Financial Solutions <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi went to Shanghai at the end of the year to celebrate the New Year and discussed important financial matters with various sectors in Shanghai. He returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 8th and went to his ministry. It is reported that the central government's finances are very stable. The expenses for party, government, and military affairs in January, as well as the military expenses for suppressing the rebellion in Fujian, have all been arranged. Currently, efforts are being made to find new sources of revenue without increasing the burden on the people. It is expected that the central government's financial revenue and expenditure will be balanced in about six months. As for the Shanghai newspaper reports that Finance Minister Kong has borrowed another one million yuan from the Shanghai financial industry, this is actually the remaining amount of the previously agreed two million yuan loan. Only one million was delivered at that time, and the remaining amount was only recently paid in full, leading to the misunderstanding that a new loan was borrowed. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>The main culprit, Mayor Bayonne, has been arrested</p>
<p>Members of Parliament may not hold positions as lawyers concurrently</p>
<p>Paris police to be transferred under central control</p>
<p>(Paris) The Bayonne bond fraud case has aroused public outrage throughout France and is feared to have a significant impact on the current cabinet. Mayor Garat of Bayonne, a member of parliament involved in the bond case, has been arrested and is currently imprisoned in the Paris City Hall prison. He will be charged with theft, forgery, illegal use of public documents and funds, fraud, and receiving stolen goods. Garat declared, "I, like others, was deceived." The Prime Minister's Office today denied rumors that Chautemps had asked Colonial Minister Dalimier to resign. According to Le Matin, the Chautemps cabinet will resign en masse tomorrow, and then Chautemps will form a new cabinet. Today, more than 150 lawyers marched outside the Ministry of Justice and petitioned the authorities that lawyers who are members of parliament should be prohibited from practicing law. There are rumors that senior officials in this bond case were bribed. It was heard tonight that the main culprit in the case, financier Stavisky, was seen in Chamonix. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the discovery of the major Bayonne fraud case, it is speculated here that French Prime Minister Chautemps and all cabinet members will resign tomorrow. If Colonial Minister Dalimier resigns voluntarily, the entire French cabinet may have a chance to survive. Dalimier is widely believed to be involved in the case, but Chautemps is strongly defending him. The Paris press has learned that two other cabinet members are also involved in the case. According to general political opinion, if cabinet members do not resign voluntarily, they will inevitably be overthrown by the parliament, which will convene on the 9th, at which time French Prime Minister Chautemps will personally be interrogated. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Parisian newspapers expect that Prime Minister Chautemps will reorganize the cabinet due to the bond fraud case, and Herriot may be the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Stavisky fraud case, "L'Ere Nouvelle" published a message saying, "There has been no decision on Colonial Minister Dalimier's resignation as of last night. It is generally believed that this will not happen before today's cabinet meeting. However, the cabinet's mass resignation has been discussed, so that President Lebrun may appoint Chautemps to form a new cabinet, and the new cabinet members can all attend the parliament on Thursday. It is generally believed that the Chamber of Deputies will not discuss the Stavisky case or other issues before Thursday. After the end of the recess, the Chamber of Deputies must elect a presidium, and it will not be issued until Thursday," and so on. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Bayonne Municipal Bank bond fraud case occurred, it was found that Garat, the chairman of the bank and mayor, a member of parliament of the Radical Socialist Party, was involved in the case and has been arrested. The Radical Party caucus held a meeting at 10:30 this morning and will make a major decision, the most important of which is to expel certain important party members from the party. According to Le Parisien, the government believes that the mutual confrontation between the detective team and the judicial police is very harmful, and it intends to reorganize the police cadres. Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Chautemps intends to merge the two agencies into one and, if necessary, request funds from the parliament to transform the Paris city police into a central police force.

<p>Slightly Dissatisfied with the League of Nations</p>
<p>No New Developments with France</p>
<p>(Paris) "La Victoire" here today published an important interview with Polish Foreign Minister Major Beck, discussing the country's recent diplomatic situation in detail. Beck's interview also touched on the League of Nations. He said, "Although Poland has not reduced its efforts to use the League of Nations to seek a higher system of international cooperation, the League of Nations has never been strong in Eastern Europe." Beck expressed pleasure at the improvement of relations between Germany and Poland, but he also said that this kind of political action can cause dissatisfaction in other areas. The dispute between Poland and Germany is generally regarded as an indispensable success in international gatherings and an unresolvable problem in international politics. However, after frank negotiations with the German government, it was found that the reality differed greatly from what was depicted in newspapers. Beck then discussed the restoration of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, saying that it was an ideal effort to seek new paths and positive results, and that every stage of the development of relations between Poland and Russia was guaranteed by positive declarations and political documents. As for the relationship between Poland and France, Beck said that there were no new events to report on this, but this alone can be regarded as a positive declaration. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos gave a statement to the press this morning, expressing gratitude for the warm reception given to him by the King of Italy and Prime Minister Mussolini. He said that Greece has always held the concept of assisting and cooperating with all nations, and deeply desires to improve friendly relations with other countries. He has taken this opportunity to express this intention sincerely. Greece has signed friendship treaties with most of its neighboring countries, and hopes to extend these treaties to all countries in the Balkan Peninsula. He also wishes to present to the Italian government the scope and importance of the newly concluded agreement between Greece and Turkey, as this agreement is the most effective guarantee for peace in the Balkans. Finally, he said that he will go to London to complete his travels to England, France, and Italy, as these three countries have long been allies of Greece. As for Greek foreign policy, it is to strictly abide by and maintain various treaties. The Little Entente and the Balkan Pact draft are two kinds of alliances, and their nature is completely different. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Simon Reports on the Results of Talks in Rome</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald left Lossiemouth this afternoon and is expected to arrive in London around noon tomorrow. At that time, he will discuss the results of the talks in Rome with Foreign Secretary Simon. Therefore, the press attaches great importance to this week, regarding the 7th as a critical day. The British cabinet meeting will be held on Wednesday, at which time the general outline of the European situation will be discussed, and Simon's report on the talks in Rome will take up most of the time. The London newspapers have begun to predict the general outline of the cabinet's future decisions, but none can make extremely certain statements. For example, "The Times" said that the report Simon brought back from Rome this time cannot, of course, be a definitive solution to the heavy disarmament problem, because the scope of disarmament is not limited to Britain and Italy. Furthermore, since France has already shown a willingness to compromise, the achievement of a future disarmament treaty, whether it is small-scale or experimental in nature, is quite possible.

<p>Avoids Answering Questions About Japanese-Russian Relations</p>
<p>(Washington) The first Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, and the first American Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, arrived here at the same time. Bullitt recently went to Russia to present his credentials and then returned to the United States to discuss the establishment of the embassy with President Roosevelt and report on his initial impressions of the Soviet Union. He crossed the Atlantic with Troyanovsky on the same ship. When the two arrived here, many senior officials from the State Department came to the station to welcome them. Troyanovsky gave a speech by radio, saying that he was willing to "work for world peace." Troyanovsky then told reporters that the rapprochement between the United States and Russia at a time when various Far Eastern problems are unresolved is "It may be that in the future some situation will occur that will make people feel that the US-Russian rapprochement is a good thing. What the future holds will depend on future circumstances and needs." Troyanovsky added that it is not known whether such a need will ever arise. Troyanovsky avoided answering questions about Japanese-Russian relations, but said, "In reality, world history will become the history of the Pacific Ocean. We are now entering this history, but the Atlantic era has not yet ended. Major events are developing in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the United States and Russia are concerned about all events along the coasts of the two oceans and the seas surrounding them. American Ambassador to Russia Bullitt declared that he is scheduled to return to Moscow around February 1 to take office. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>National Power Should Belong to the Government</p>
<p>(Rome) It is still doubtful whether renowned international politician Titulescu will accept the position of Foreign Minister. Titulescu is willing to take office only if the King of Romania agrees to change the government. Titulescu's conditions for taking office are the same as those proposed by former Prime Minister Maniu a few months ago. Maniu resigned because the King of Romania refused to consider his suggestions. It is heard that the conditions include the resignation or reassignment of the current Minister of the Army, the head of the secret detective team, the head of the Gendarmerie, the head of the police in Bucharest, and the King's private secretary. Titulescu believes that national power should belong to the government, not to a small number of people who are not responsible to the people. This view is strongly supported by the public.

<p>Buckingham Palace is Not in the Labour Party's Policy</p>
<p>(London) The leader of the Labour Party, the opposition party in the government, Cripps, gave a speech in Nottingham yesterday, saying that the future socialist government will be able to overcome all obstacles, even if it involves the King himself. He also said that all opposition forces from Buckingham Palace and other sources, we must overcome them. This speech has deeply shocked British public opinion, as Cripps's words indirectly involved the King. Today, Cripps issued a statement clarifying the above, saying that people have misunderstood what I meant by "Buckingham Palace". I did not mean the King, but usually the term "Buckingham Palace" refers to the palace and the people around the King, which is what I meant. No one can criticize the King, because the King maintains absolute fairness and impartiality, which the British people all acknowledge, and this is what I dare to assert. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Cripps's speech in Nottingham on Saturday, which involved Buckingham Palace, has been disavowed by various leaders of the socialist faction. Summarizing the remarks of several important Labour Party figures today, former Home Secretary Clynes said that any political party that wants to win an election should first avoid conflicts with the royal family. Former Minister of Mines Shinwell said that only Cripps himself knows what Cripps meant. Buckingham Palace is not in the Labour Party's policy. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden said that Cripps has always been a tactful person, but his remarks now clearly intend to establish a dictatorship and overthrow the parliament and the constitutional government. Lord Marley said that he recognizes the possibility of fascism as a major danger, and he will never advocate fascism from Buckingham Palace. Former Political Secretary of the National Labour Committee, Elvin, said that Cripps's remarks only represent the opinions of a part of the Labour Party, who seem to be able to create panic in the electoral district.

<h3 id="e33">Roosevelt Plans to Ask Congress for Special Power to Negotiate Tax Treaties <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Protection Tax Plan Delayed</p>
<p>Abandoning the Strong Policy on War Debts</p>
<p>Willing to Automatically Reduce Finland's by 50%</p>
<p>(Washington) The "Commercial News", known for its well-informed sources, reported that President Roosevelt decided last night to wait for a more favorable opportunity to request broad powers from Congress to engage in negotiations on trade agreements and tariff treaties. The reason is the increasing number of protests from the industrial sector against Roosevelt's commercial advisor's plans. Therefore, Roosevelt had to postpone requesting broad powers from Congress. The plan drafted by the Senate Tariff Committee will also be delayed in its release. The main purpose of the plan is to protect various industries with potential for development. Other industries, although protected by tariffs, still have insufficient domestic consumption in the United States, or the national demand is very limited. Even if tariff protection is added, they still have no extraordinary development capabilities. Certain goods, such as rayon, are hardly affected by foreign competition. The import of American rayon is only one percent of domestic production. The tariffs on these goods can be further reduced to stimulate American production. Furthermore, taxes cannot be increased on manganese imported from Russia, because American manganese products are more labor-intensive than those from Russia, and the U.S. Navy Department must store domestically produced manganese to meet wartime needs. Therefore, there is no need to increase the import tax on manganese. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the "New York Public Forum", President Roosevelt requested Congress to revise Finland's war debt to the United States in a spirit of special friendship, reducing the total amount of war debt by 50%. Finland is the only country that has fully repaid its war debt on time. The President's move is the first break from the U.S. government's hard-line policy on war debts. At the same time, it is a warning and hint to countries that have defaulted or only paid a portion of their war debts on time, and indicates the limit of concessions on war debts. Because Finland has not defaulted on war debt payments, and is only able to obtain a 50% reduction, then when other countries reopen war debt negotiations with the United States, the United States' concession will also not exceed this 50% limit.

The prison authorities still invite Western doctors Liu Jicheng and Bilarri to treat him every day. Although Noulens refuses food, he still drinks about two to three pounds of boiled water every day. As of the 8th, his pulse, blood pressure, and heartbeat are all normal. However, Noulens' face is thinner, and he dreams day and night, seemingly due to lack of strength from fasting. According to doctors' predictions, this phenomenon is difficult to maintain permanently, because his heart is very prone to fever, and there is the possibility of sudden changes at any time. At that time, it will not be treatable with medicine and his life will be in danger. Our court authorities are unable to persuade him and can only let things take their course.

Currently, the political upheaval in Fujian province has not yet complied.

The first responsible special tax agency at the point of entry will uniformly collect the special tax, issue a tax-paid certificate valid in the special tax zone, and affix an imprinted photo to the package before allowing transportation. Those requiring customs clearance should also fill out a yellow declaration form, along with the tax-paid certificate and other documents, and send them to customs for verification before allowing import. Those who have paid the special tax on native tobacco leaves and tobacco shreds in the six special tax zone provinces and transport them to Fujian province should temporarily handle them uniformly according to the regulations for transporting to non-special tax zones. Merchants are allowed to present the original tax certificate, or sub-transport certificate with other supporting documents, along with the tax collection evidence for transportation to the province, to the responsible special tax agency for verification and return of half of the original special tax paid, that is, a refund of two yuan and three cents and five li per hundred market catties, to show compassion.

<p>(Jinan) Shen Honglie said that regarding the increase in the consolidated tax, the Shanghai cigarette industry has already acknowledged the new tax rate, and it is feared that opposition from other provinces will not be able to reverse it. However, part of the match industry advocates acknowledging the tax increase and combining sales through industry associations, while another part advocates continuing to petition for tax reduction. Opinions are divided. Most merchants in Shandong province have small capital and cannot withstand heavy taxes. A request should still be made to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the status quo. The export of vegetables and cattle is gradually becoming prosperous. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>=From the Onset of Illness to Sudden Death in Just a Few Hours=</p>
<p>=Funeral Held on the 4th, Cremated at the Indian Cemetery=</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, suddenly suffered a stroke due to cerebral anemia at 1:00 PM on the 2nd of this month and passed away at his private residence on Hing Han Road, Hong Kong. The coffin was closed at noon on the 3rd, and the funeral was held at 2:00 PM on the 4th, with cremation at the Indian Cemetery in Happy Valley. Over a thousand prominent figures and gentry and merchants from Hong Kong and China attended the funeral. Many condolence messages were also sent from the central and Guangdong-Guangxi authorities. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wu returned to Hong Kong from Shanghai several months ago and resided in his private residence in Kai Tak, Kowloon, and he refrained from politics, spending his days reading and rarely going out. Recently, he moved to the third floor of No. 3 Hing Han Road, Sai Ying Pun. The building was originally inhabited by his children to facilitate their studies at various schools in Hong Kong and China. Wu was physically strong and rarely sick, but at 10:30 AM on the 2nd of this month, he suddenly had a severe headache and asked his family to get aspirin for him. His family obeyed, but it was ineffective. By 11:00 AM, the pain had intensified, and he soon fainted and lost consciousness. His wife urgently summoned Dr. Chile Lao, head of the Medical Department of the University of Hong Kong, Guo Shengde, and his son-in-law, Dr. Ma Huimin, for consultation. At that time, the doctors diagnosed cerebral anemia and rupture of a major blood vessel and were planning to perform a blood transfusion, injecting fresh blood from others, but before they could take action, Wu passed away at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Wu's passing was deeply mourned by his wife, children, relatives, and friends in Hong Kong and China. A funeral arrangement office was set up at the residence, and reports were sent to friends and relatives in all directions. His body was closed in a coffin at noon on the 3rd. At the time of the closure, Wu's wife, his three sons and five daughters, were on the verge of collapse from grief, and were still wailing despite the comfort of relatives and friends. Hu Hanmin and Sun Ke personally came to pay their respects, and Hu could not help but shed old tears upon seeing the scene. The Southwest Political Affairs Council sent Luo Yiqun to Hong Kong to represent the memorial service. The others present were Gan Jiahai, Foreign Affairs Inspector of the Five Provinces, Hu Hanmin's daughter Mulan, Deng Zhaoyin, Zou Dianbang, Luo Xuefu, Hong Kong gentry Cao Shanyun, Ma Yongcan, and others, totaling several hundred people.</p>
<p>The funeral was held at 2:00 PM on the 4th. The ceremony was very simple, and cremation was used for the funeral. One hour before the funeral, Chinese and foreign relatives and friends continued to gather at Wu's residence, blocking Hing Han Road. At the sound of the bell, the mourners bowed three times to the coffin in order to pay their respects. After the tribute, the hearse set off, adorned with fresh flowers, which was quite magnificent. Wu's wife, his three sons and five daughters, all dressed in mourning clothes and straw sandals, followed along crying, extremely saddened. The hearse then passed from Hing Han Road to Bonham Road to Caine Road, out of Garden Road to Lower Albert Road, through the East Main Street, and to the Indian Cemetery at Happy Valley. Their order of procession was as follows: (1) The banner with the words "Wu Family Funeral" adorned with fresh flowers, (2) Wu's portrait, (3) Hundreds of wreaths from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and prominent figures such as Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Ji, Chen Jitang, Li Jishen, and Wu Tiecheng, (4) Students from St. Paul's School, male and female students from Minsheng College, students from Wanchai School, and students from Ying Wah College, (5) Mourning garments, (6) Hearse, (7) Relatives and friends in attendance. The procession, with plain cars and white horses, stretched for hundreds of feet, and the number of onlookers along the way was countless.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, the hearse finally reached the Indian Cemetery in Happy Valley. The funeral arrangement office had erected a shed in the square near the cemetery for the farewell ceremony. The shed was more than ten feet long and wide, with a hall in the middle, a reception area for guests on the left, and a chorus, Confucius, Zhengsheng, and silver bands on the right. Wu's portrait was hung in the center of the hall, surrounded by fresh flowers, with the horizontal inscription "Spirit Immortal" written by Tang Shaoyi above it, accompanied by a mourning couplet from Hu Hanmin. Both the couplet and the calligraphy were written by Hu himself in the style of Cao Quan. The text read, "The departed is like this, a loss for the party and the country; harmonious but not flowing, reminiscent of the ancient ministers." When the hearse arrived, the pallbearers placed the coffin in the hall. The coffin was Western-style and covered with the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth. Then, the mourners paid their respects and dispersed.</p>
<p>After the relatives and friends bid farewell, at 5:00 PM, the coffin was taken to the crematorium by the children and relatives for cremation. First, the Indian minister prayed to the corpse, and then the corpse was moved out and put into the crematorium to be burned. At this time, Wu's wife and children wailed as if they would die. The relatives and friends present were also shedding tears. The corpse was burned for several hours, and by 7:00 PM, it had been turned to ashes. It is heard that Wu had determined that he wanted the same cremation ceremony that his father, Dr. Tingfang, had when he died. Therefore, his family's actions were in accordance with his wishes.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Anhui Implements Sales and Transportation of Huai Salt on a Rotation Basis <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Salt Merchants Unwilling to Open Warehouses Due to Increased Tax Rates</p>
<p>Representatives from Taizhou and Suzhou Request the Ministry of Finance to Reduce Tax Rates</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The transportation of edible salt to Anhui has traditionally been carried out through Datong. Recently, the Ministry of Finance approved the trial sale of 100 tickets of Huai Salt on a rotating basis in Anqing. Salt merchants organized the Continental Salt Company and established a general sales office at Taiyi Salt Shop on Tonganmen Main Street outside the West Gate of Anqing. It officially opened its warehouses on December 27 of last year. Officials from the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance were dispatched to weigh the salt in the warehouse and established the following regulations for selling salt: (1) Shore Price: 12.1 yuan per brand for counties with flat taxes, 13.1 yuan per brand for counties with heavy taxes in Taihu, Susong, Wangjiang, and Zhide, and 11.1 yuan per brand for Qianshan, a county with light taxes. (2) Weight per catty: According to the Transportation Bureau's weight standard, 100 catties per stone. (3) Tare weight: According to the regulations of the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office, each jute bag is deducted 3 catties and 12 taels for tare weight, and no ropes are allowed to be added. Recently, the Anqing Continental Salt Company received an order from the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance to implement the new system of weights and measures from January 1st of this year. Due to the increased tax rate, the company is unwilling to open for business. Yang Huicun and Chen Xuehang, representatives of the chambers of commerce in Taihu and Susong counties stationed in the province, argued that under the new system of weights and measures, each dan (unit of weight) is 15 catties less than the old system, but the tax rate remains the same. The supervisory effect has been reduced, but the tax has increased, effectively adding more than three yuan to each dan. Moreover, salt merchants from counties such as Taihu and Susong gather in the provincial capital, trade is stagnant, and there is a shortage of edible salt. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the Salt Affairs Agency be ordered to instruct the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office to reduce taxes after the new weights and measures have been implemented in order to relieve the merchants and alleviate the people's difficulties.

<h3 id="e67">Sichuan Mianzhu Massacre: Eight Members of a Family Poisoned to Death <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Culprits Were a Male Servant and the Mistress</p>
<p>They Fled Immediately After Committing the Crime and Disappeared</p>
<p>According to a Sichuan dispatch, a case was recently discovered in Mianzhu County, in which eight members of the Deng family were murdered by their wicked servant, Liu Zhengkui, and an adulterous woman, Wang. Liu and Wang immediately eloped. Deng Mingchen and other members of the Deng clan have offered a reward for their capture and prosecution. This case has significant implications for public morality and human conscience. The petition from Deng Mingchen and others is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"To all benevolent gentlemen of Sichuan Province, Deng Mingchen, Zhao Donglin, and others respectfully report: a case of poisoning an entire family, with grievances profound and unredressed. We offer a reward and earnestly request assistance in apprehending the culprits. Deng Zeyi, courtesy name Yizhi, is a native of Mianzhu County, residing in the Chicken Market Dam on the North Street of the town. His ancestors were wealthy in eastern Mianzhu, owning the Yiyuan Garden, commonly known as the Deng Family Garden. His great-grandfather, Changling, was a tribute student in the Guiyou year of the Jiaqing era, appointed as Prefect of Bao’an Prefecture in Zhili. His great-grandfather, Juchen, served as a prefectural clerk; his grandfather, Mingke, was a student of the county school; and his father, Dejun, was awaiting appointment as magistrate of Tongzhou. Zeyi was his son. After the Jiawu year of the Guangxu era, the family moved to the county town. His first wife, Li, bore no children; his birth mother, Zheng, remained a widow and managed the household for over twenty years. Zeyi's first wife, Zhao, was the second daughter of Donglin. She died young. He then remarried Yang, who raised a daughter but also passed away. He then remarried another Yang, who also died, leaving behind a son. Zeyi's marital fate was considered unfavorable, and he was said to bring misfortune to his wives, making it difficult to find a suitable match. He then went to Chengdu and bought Wang. At that time, the servant Liu Zhengkui attended to his daily needs. Liu had been with the family for eight or nine years. The master treated him well, and he was obedient. The household consisted of ten people: Zeyi, his mother and children, a six-year-old daughter, a three-year-old son, a hired wet nurse named Guo, a cook, another servant woman and her son, plus the servant Liu and Wang. During the previous Red Bandit unrest, Zeyi and his family remained behind closed doors, so relatives and friends rarely visited. This continued until October, when tenant farmers and local leaders came to collect rent and the investigation bureau came to collect money, repeatedly seeking Zeyi but unable to find him. They inquired with Donglin and others, who also had not heard from him for a long time. They then went to inquire with the caretaker of the house. The caretaker was an old woman with an unfamiliar face. According to her, she was hired by Liu Zhengkui on the eighth day of the eighth month to watch the house. When the two women arrived, they did not see Zeyi. Only Liu Zhengkui and Wang were there. Liu told her that the Zeyi family had gone to the provincial capital, but the young master's mother was still at home and would be leaving soon, instructing her to watch the house. The two women also said that Wang and Liu left together on the night of the eleventh day of the eighth month. Upon hearing the caretaker's words, Donglin and others were shocked. They immediately sent people to search for them in the provincial capital and neighboring counties, but to no avail. They searched all the relatives and friends in the county town, but they disappeared without a trace. Donglin then presented a petition to the local leader Dai Qingyun and relatives Zheng Yongquan, Hou Haibo, and others, reporting the situation to the county government. An investigation was ordered, and they went to the house with criminal investigators. The doors were unlocked, and the furniture was intact. They then opened the back door and went to a secluded area, where they found an area with no grass, covered with slag. They were greatly surprised. They ordered people to dig it up in front of everyone. First, they dug through ash, then charcoal ash, then bricks and stones, and then they saw a leg bone. Everyone was horrified and immediately reported it to the county government. The county magistrate, judicial officials, the city defense command, and the public security bureau all arrived in person. In front of everyone, they ordered people to dig up eight bodies of men, women, and children, all in one pit. They were all decomposed, with only white bones remaining. Seeing this tragic scene, everyone was filled with compassion and tears streamed down their faces. It was then discovered that Liu Zhengkui, in collusion with Wang, had plotted to kill the entire family of eight for their wealth and had secretly fled in the night. This wicked servant betrayed his master, and the adulterous woman killed her husband. What did the young children know? What was the fault of the laborers? They were all poisoned to death. This inhumanity has reached its extreme. The clan leader Deng Mingchen and relative Zhao Donglin have repeatedly petitioned the county government. County Magistrate Luo has dispatched a team to strictly arrest them and has offered a reward for information leading to their arrest, so they can be punished according to the law. We deeply fear that the wicked servant and the adulterous woman will flee far away, and people will not know their wicked deeds, allowing them to escape justice. Therefore, we are making this public announcement. Anyone who captures the adulterous woman Wang or the wicked servant Liu Zhengkui, the Deng family is willing to offer a reward of one thousand silver dollars. For the capture of either man or woman, a reward of six hundred silver dollars will be given. We earnestly request all gentlemen to pay attention to the investigation. If they can be apprehended, the reward money is currently held in Mianzhu, with Deng family members and Zhao Donglin responsible. We will not break our promise. We respectfully announce this to all people in Sichuan Province. If anyone obtains this notice, please widely circulate and post it in public places, so that everyone knows. If the true culprits are caught and the grievances are redressed, not only will we be grateful and never forget, but the wronged souls of the Deng family will also bow their heads in gratitude from the afterlife. We respectfully announce this and ask for your compassion. Deng Mingchen, Zhao Donglin, Zheng Yongquan, Hou Haibo, and others of Mianzhu County jointly present this."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Travel Notes on Sichuan and Xikang <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Lixing</p>
<p>｜From Shanghai to Nanjing｜ (1)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Sichuan-Xikang Observation Group boarded the Minsheng Company's Yongnian steamer on the evening of the 6th to head west. The six members of the group are Gu Zhizhong, Zhang Xianmei, Chen Youqin, Lu Yi, Tang Huiping, and Wang Zhenhuan. The significance of this trip lies in the fact that since the Northeast has fallen, those who speak of observation must include the Northwest. However, people are largely unaware that Sichuan, Xikang, or some southwestern provinces, are simultaneously under the intense pressure of several imperialists. Their perilous situation and importance are nearly equal to those of the Northwest. Moreover, the Tibetan side has been incited and engaged in warfare year-round, already occupying areas east of central Xikang. The people of our country must not neglect this due to the remoteness of the location or the sudden rise of political conflicts in the Central Plains. We believe it is necessary to observe its current situation. Furthermore, in today's world, everyone is gathering their strength to seek a way out in the same direction. This is why the country has so many troubles. If those who harbor great ambitions prepare to sacrifice and endure hardship, starting with the most basic work, then the country's affairs would not have come to this. If news reporters also compete in the same direction, the information obtained will be too similar, bland, and rarely exciting. Moreover, before these political conflicts are resolved, even the most ordinary and inferior military and political news is subject to fragmentation and dismemberment. From the perspective of the news reporters themselves, in an environment where they are mentally suffering, it seems more appropriate to open up another path, seek another bright road, and obtain news with a completely different flavor.</p>
<p>That evening, the group members were too tired from packing, and they all fell sound asleep after going to bed. When they woke up at dawn, the Yongnian steamer had already moved westward. During breakfast on the 7th, the steamer's manager, Mr. Xie Sasheng, spoke enthusiastically about the scenery of Sichuan, particularly the clouds and rain of the Wu Mountains, inspiring their imagination. The food and drink on board were very comfortable. After a heavy fog that night, heavy snow followed. The steamer lost its direction and had to stop the engine and wait for the right time to move. It started again at 11 PM, but when they woke up in the morning, the fog returned, and the ship stopped moving again. It moved and stopped in this manner until 10:30 AM on the 8th, when they finally arrived in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The estimated itinerary is roughly ten days to reach Hankou, fourteen days to reach Yichang, twenty days to reach Chongqing, and twenty-three or twenty-four days to reach Chengdu. However, if there are changes in the weather, delays or postponements in the journey will be inevitable. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Work of the Lunan Archaeological Team Concludes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The excavation of the Anshang Site has been completed</p>
<p>Over seventy boxes of artifacts are transported to Jinan for sorting</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: The Lunan Archaeological Team, jointly formed by the Academia Sinica and the Shandong Antiquities Research Association, excavated the "Anshang Site" in Anshang Village, Teng County, and the Cao Wang Tomb in the three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi in Lunan from October of last year. They searched for relics from the Spring and Autumn, Warring States, and Han periods to study China's ancient history, culture, and art. The excavation ended in early December. The people in charge of the excavation, Dong Zuobin, Qi Yanru, and others, arrived in Jinan one after another from Teng, stayed at the Antiquities Research Association, and sorted and studied the relics they brought with them. However, there are still over seventy boxes (matchbox size) of collected relics, such as pottery shards, bones, and painted stones, stored in the home of Mr. Huang Futang, a local elder in Teng County. Due to the failure to negotiate the transportation properly, they have not been fully transported to Jinan. The Academia Sinica has notified the Jinpu Railway Bureau to approve the loading and transportation to Jinan. Dong Zuobin has already gone to Anyang, Henan, to inspect the local excavation of antiquities, and is not in Jinan. Wang Xiang and Qi Yanru boarded the first Jinpu train at 9:30 AM today (the 6th) to go to Teng for transportation. They should be able to return to Jinan within a few days. It is reported that Wang and others have recently completed the restoration of broken pieces of dou (stemmed bowl), li (tripod cauldron), and fou (jar) unearthed at the Anshang Village and Cao Wang Tomb, closely resembling the original objects. In addition, the Shandong Provincial Library recently purchased a pair of stone Han sheep for 250 yuan, said to be unearthed in Shou County, Anhui Province. After verification by Wang Xiantang and others, they are confirmed to be Han Dynasty relics, sacrificial images displayed in front of the tomb passage. There are about eight or nine characters on each sheep, but they are difficult to identify at this time due to corrosion. They are currently being cleaned, and it is expected that they will make contributions to the study of Han Dynasty history and culture in the future. (6th)</p>

The kidnappers, including Jin Amei, were taken into custody. During the preliminary interrogation, the kidnappers implicated several others. Captain Fan went to Shanghai that night and rescued a three-year-old Dai child from the home of Xu Chen in the Xiaoshadu area of Shanghai. The female bandit Xu Chen and her daughter Jin Nv were arrested on the spot. At the same time, Inspector Gu Lansheng was secretly dispatched to the Shihudang train station, where he arrested the main bandits in the kidnapping case of Jiang Xingbo and the Dai child, Xu Ade, Ding Afa, and Gu Yunlong. Two pistols and thirty-eight bullets were found on Xu Ade and Ding Afa. It is learned that they have been handed over to the Minhang District Department for investigation.</p>

Cai initially declined the position in public, but after repeated persuasion by the committee members, he reluctantly agreed to accept it. He then stated that the chamber's affairs and documents must be jointly responsible by the standing committee members, to which everyone nodded in agreement and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Caretaker of Chunyang Temple Robbed <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Chunyang Temple outside the South Gate of the Huangpu Bund has no property or incense offerings. Therefore, there are no monks, Taoists, or lay practitioners. Only the caretaker, Ayou, remains to watch the temple, grow vegetables, and raise chickens and ducks to make a living. His poverty is well known. However, six or seven robbers suddenly came the night before, dug a hole in the wall, struck Ayou on the back with an iron ruler, knocked him to the ground, and tied him up. They then entered the room, tied up two relatives of Ayou who were staying overnight, searched for clothes, chickens, and ducks, and fled. The three were tied up and unable to untie themselves until yesterday morning when villagers passing by heard their cries and came in to rescue them. It is truly strange that such a barren temple was also coveted by robbers.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Dispute Over Changing Scales for Salt in Wuxi <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The salt sold by the local salt merchant guild has always been measured using the canal scale. The salt stores then resell it to retail customers using the salt scale, from which they can earn a small profit. Recently, all industries have switched to new scales. The salt guild has also followed suit. However, the new scale is smaller than the canal scale, and the wholesale price should also be reduced accordingly. However, the salt guild not only did not reduce the wholesale price but also canceled the old practice of deducting for rope. Therefore, the salt stores have no profit to make and strongly oppose it. They have repeatedly negotiated with the salt guild but have not achieved satisfactory results. Until yesterday, the salt guild agreed to consult with the Shanghai Salt Merchants Association before responding. It is unknown whether this will resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Pei Xiyuan, a special commissioner from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, was commissioned to inspect physical education in the five counties of Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, Jiangyin, and Jingjiang. Commissioner Pei has inspected the four counties of Yi, Li, Jing, and Cheng and arrived in Changzhou on the 7th. He inspected the county's sports field and inquired in detail. On the 8th, he visited Yang Haoming, the director of the Bureau of Education, to investigate the general situation of the funding for various agricultural education centers and sports fields. It is said that among the five counties, Yixing has the best physical education program, followed by Wujin, then Jiangyin and Jingjiang, with Liyang being the worst. Commissioner Pei completed his inspection of the counties and returned to Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 8th to report his findings.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Zhenjiang Shen Qingchen Case Concludes Debate <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The case of Shen Qingchen, the former magistrate of Fengxian County, who was accused of corruption, involved Yang Changyou, the secretary who was accused of fraudulent acquisition of wealth, Xu Yongjiang, the chief of the fourth self-government district, Feng Wenchuan, the assistant, and Diao Yebai, a Chinese medicine practitioner in the county. They were transferred by the provincial government to the local court for investigation last year. Except for Shen Qingchen, who was dismissed by the prosecutor's office, Yang Changyou, Xu Yongjiang, and others were publicly prosecuted for taking advantage of their positions to intimidate and defraud others and transferred to the criminal court. Presiding Judge Zhou Baochu held several court hearings. Yesterday was the date for the debate. First, Tao Rong, the defense lawyer for Yang, stood up and argued that the defendant in this case was prosecuted for taking advantage of his position to intimidate and defraud others. The defendant was ordered by the county magistrate on March 20 last year to investigate whether Zhu Jinwen had communicated with the enemy. At that time, District Chief Xu Yongjiang and others were present during the conversation, and there was no opportunity for fraud. Moreover, the plaintiff Zhu Jinwen's statements were inconsistent. The defendant's statement in the Civil Affairs Department was made under duress at the time. Therefore, he should be thoroughly investigated and declared innocent. Then, Chen Liren, the defense lawyer for Feng Wenchuan, and Fang Enpu, the defense lawyer for Diao Yebai, gave their arguments. Judge Zhou then declared the debate closed. The defendants Yang Changyou and Xu Yongjiang were remanded in custody, Diao Yebai was released on the original bail, and Feng Wenchuan was required to provide an additional 400 yuan in written bail. Tao Rong had requested bail for Yang Changyou, but it was not granted.</p>

<p>Since July of the 21st year, the small steamer industry on the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu route was united through an agreement among nine companies, operating on a daily rotation basis. Later, the Dada Company joined the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu route. The route was temporarily suspended due to low water levels in the canal. The long-distance Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu route was restored in April last year, but the long-distance traffic was disrupted again due to floods and fires. After the floodwaters receded, Dada Company requested to join the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu route and operate the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu service, based on the order of the Ministry of Communications. In order to maintain the status quo, the nine companies agreed to Dada's request. At the same time, Jiangtai Company also requested the same treatment as Dada. The Zhenjiang Shipping Industry Association believed that the Zhenjiang shipping industry was under environmental pressure and could not handle it. Therefore, it initiated a preparatory meeting for a large-scale joint operation of the upper and lower river shipping industries. However, although Jiangtai Company participated in the joint operation, it still insisted on opening the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu service first, as a precursor to gaining a foothold. At this point, the joint operation was once again obstructed. After discussions among various parties, it was finally decided that the Zhenjiang-Qingjiangpu service would be divided into 32 days per month. In addition to the nine companies, Dada Company would join and operate for two days per month. Dada would give four-tenths of its profits to Jiangtai. At the same time, preparations for the joint operation continued. The disputes on the Zhenjiang route were resolved at this point.</p>

<p>Shi Xingrui, the captain of the second detachment of the Gaoyou County Police Team, and Pian Futong, the acting captain of the fourth detachment, were previously ordered to suppress bandits in the tenth district. When they arrived in the district, because it was late, they requested Xia Meikui, the head of the tenth district Tuan Lian, to notify the Bao Wei Tuan in each township to avoid misunderstandings. However, when the two captains Shi and Pian passed through Zhujiadui, the Bao Wei Tuan there, suspecting them of being bandits, opened fire, wounding two soldiers of the second detachment, Zhou Dezong and Zhao Yufa. After Shi and Pian negotiated with the Bao Wei Tuan, they learned that District Head Xia had not notified them, causing the accident. They then questioned District Head Xia. After mediation by local people, District Head Xia and the Bao Wei Tuan each provided 30 yuan for medical expenses, which the injured soldiers used to go to the Datong Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, District Head Xia recently accused Police Captain Zhu Hua and the two captains Shi and Pian of extortion of 30 yuan to the Civil Affairs Department and the Ninth District Administrative Commissioner's Office. Dong Guangfu was appointed by the Civil Affairs Department to conduct a thorough investigation of this case together with Commissioner Ma Zhenbang. Commissioner Dong came to Gaoyou last night and investigated the case at the county government this morning. County Magistrate Yang reported the details of the incident to the provincial commission based on the police team's report. The provincial commissioner then ordered County Magistrate Yang to order the police to summon the plaintiff and witnesses for interrogation and submit them to the provincial commission for verification.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 8th) morning at 11:00 AM, the Hangzhou branch of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank ordered Huang Xirong from Xiaoshan, a staff member, to take a matured check of more than 2,860 yuan issued by the local bank to exchange for cash. Huang took the check to exchange it, and the local bank paid Huang the full amount. Huang counted the money on the counter. After counting a thousand yuan, a middle-aged man wearing a gray silk robe and black mandarin jacket suddenly came forward, snatched the thousand-yuan bills counted by Huang, and fled into the crowd. Huang shouted for a thief and was caught by Lin Yuehua, a police officer hired by the bank. He was detained in the Public Security Bureau. According to his confession, he is from Shaoxing, named Zhou Afa, and runs a drugstore. He has an elderly mother, wife, and daughter at home. Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, he committed this act. He requested lenient treatment.</p>

<p>Lu Xiangwen, a woman from Henan, is 20 years old and quite beautiful. After graduating from the Henan Women's Normal School, she worked as a village school teacher. Because she was young and liked to travel, she was seduced and lost her virginity by a man from Anhui named Hua. Her father found out about it and scolded her slightly. Therefore, Xiangwen had no face to stay at home. She came to Hangzhou last month and stayed at her classmate Wang's home at the foot of Geling Mountain in West Lake, intending to find a job and make a living. Unexpectedly, after several days, there was no hope. Therefore, she had the idea of committing suicide, bought sleeping pills and swallowed them. Fortunately, her classmate noticed and questioned her closely, and she confessed the truth. She was immediately rescued and did not lose her life. Wang asked someone to accompany her back to her hometown in Henan yesterday (the 8th) morning.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Sun Ke Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Spoke <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Said Hu Hanmin Indicated He Has No Intention of Going to Nanjing for Now</p>
<p>The Southwest's Understanding of the Central Government Has Increased</p>
<p>Hu's Stance is Against the Matter, Not Against the Person</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, traveled to the Philippines with his wife and others at the end of the year for a sea voyage. He made a stop in Hong Kong and Guangdong, where he visited Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, and other Central Committee members in the Southwest to discuss the current situation. He arrived in Shanghai on the Gran Tronto ship of the Da Lai Company at 8:30 yesterday morning, accompanied by Chuan Bingchang and others. His wife plans to stay in Guangdong for a few days and did not come with him. After arriving in Shanghai, Sun told reporters that Hu Zhantang has no intention of coming to Nanjing, and the rumors of a third government in Guangdong are completely unfounded. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation The Da Lai Company's Gran Tronto ship entered the port at 7:30 yesterday morning and docked at the Da Lai Wharf in Bailianjing, Pudong. Legislative Yuan members Ma Chaojun, Chen Jianru, Wu Jingxiong, Secretary-General Liang Hancao, Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weizhi, Vice Minister of Interior Chuan Rulin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Ming, Director of the Municipal Security Department Yang Hu, Chief of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Xingya, and Secretary of the Municipal Government Tang Shixuan all boarded the ship to welcome him. At 8:30, Sun landed at the Jianghai Customs Wharf and went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He plans to stay in Shanghai for one or two days before returning to Nanjing to report the details of his trip to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel Those who came with Sun yesterday were Legislative Yuan member Chuan Bingchang, Secretary Yang Huayi, and attendants. The wife of former Aviation Director Zhang Huichang also came to Shanghai on the same ship. As for Mrs. Sun, Chen Shuying, she did not come with him because her two sons are studying at Lingnan University in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Sun's Talk After returning to his residence, Sun immediately received reporters from various newspapers. According to him, he went to Hong Kong with his wife for a sea trip and visited Hu Zhantang. Then he went to Guangdong and met with Xiao Focheng, Chen Bonan, and others to exchange views on the current situation. As a result, he plans to submit Hu's eight proposals, published in Hong Kong on December 17 last year, to the Central Standing Committee for discussion first, to see what everyone thinks, and then make a decision on whether to submit them as a proposal to the Fourth Central Committee, which will also be decided after discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>Southwest Attitude Sun also said that he only stayed in Guangzhou for one day, so he did not have much time to discuss the details with the Southwest Committee. He only met with Chen Bonan and others to discuss matters. He learned that the Guangdong Committee generally agreed with Hu's proposals on political issues. As for what method to use to accept his proposals in the future, it was not discussed. Of the eight principles advocated by Hu, only four are more important: (1) The military must not interfere in politics, and military power belongs to the government; (2) Civil rights must be liberated, and the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association must be effectively protected; (3) The central government and the provinces implement equal rights and their methods; (4) Finance is open, and the budget system is implemented. Hu has no intention of coming to Nanjing for now. As for the issue of people, Hu did not talk about it at all. In short, the result of this trip to the South by Central Committee member Zhang Puquan and others has increased the Southwest's understanding of the Central Government.</p>
<p>Hu and Others on Fujian Sun also said that Hu and other Central Committee members in the Southwest strongly disapprove of the absurd actions of Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian this time, destroying the party and the country. Therefore, they deeply hope that Chen and others can repent as soon as possible and voluntarily abolish the so-called "People's Government." As for whether the Central Government will temporarily end the military after occupying Fuzhou and use political means to solve other problems, he is still not sure because he is traveling. In short, besides using military means to sanction the Fujian incident, there is no other proper way. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Japanese Brutality Towards Our Northeastern Compatriots <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>First Slaughter, Then Opium</p>
<p>Forcing the Reading of Japanese, Attempting Assimilation</p>
<p>Reports from Messrs. Li Yanlu and Liu Bin</p>
<p>A Far Eastern News Agency report states that Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, specially dispatched Li Yanlu, Major General Chief of Staff of his department, and Liu Bin, Major Staff Officer, from the Muling camp on December 21st of last year, carrying orders to travel from Harbin to Shanghai to meet Zhang Chuyu, the representative stationed in Shanghai, to report on the recent combat situation of the army. A reporter from the Far Eastern News Agency visited Messrs. Li and Liu at their residence yesterday and was granted an audience. They recounted the situation in detail. A record of their account is as follows:</p>
<p>Carrying Orders to Shanghai: On December 21st of last year, I received a personal instruction from Deputy Commander Kong, instructing me to come to Shanghai to meet Representative Zhang Chuyu of our department and report on the recent combat situation of our army. This journey was fraught with hardship and difficulty. We departed from the Muling headquarters camp on the 22nd, accompanied by Staff Officer Liu Bin. We both disguised ourselves as impoverished civilians and traveled on foot to Harbin. Upon arriving in Harbin, we were repeatedly interrogated by the Japanese and puppet troops. We answered that we were entering the pass to return to our hometown, and only then did we escape the clutches of the tiger. After a brief stay in Harbin, we took a train to Dalian, and from Dalian, we took a steamer, arriving in Shanghai on the 6th of this month. Fortunately, everything turned out well, and no other unexpected incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Dongning: Since Deputy Commander-in-Chief Kong returned to his defense area, the morale of the army has been greatly boosted. We fought with the Japanese and puppet troops several times a day for more than two months. I led my troops in dozens of engagements. In early October of the lunar calendar, we attacked Dongning twice. As a result, it was finally recovered by our army. At that time, the headquarters was established in the county. Before we could catch our breath, the Japanese army dispatched more than ten aircraft and more than 20,000 infantry and cavalry troops, adopting a strategy of large-scale encirclement to surround Dongning. Our troops were attacked from both the front and rear, and the situation was extremely precarious. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers fought bravely and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, breaking through the heavy encirclement. Now, we are reorganizing our troops and taking refuge in nearby counties to await opportunities.</p>
<p>Lack of Ammunition: The biggest reason for our army's withdrawal from Dongning this time was the lack of ammunition support. We relied entirely on hand-to-hand combat. If we had sufficient supplies, the Japanese and puppet troops, no matter how strong, would not be able to withstand a single blow. What they rely on is only sophisticated equipment. In addition, the ground there had already frozen. Our army's supplies and clothing were mostly secretly provided by the local people. My arrival here is to represent our Deputy Commander-in-Chief in expressing our gratitude to all sectors for their previous assistance, and to request that all sectors keep the nation and the people in mind and continuously supply our army with ammunition, so that we can fight to the death against the bandits without failing in our efforts.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambitions: Since the Japanese army occupied our Northeast, its actions have changed greatly in recent months. Our commander instructed me to announce this point to the people in the rear, so that they would know one aspect of the Japanese ambition. Previously, the Japanese army only occupied Manchuria and nearby provinces. Recently, they have been trying to seize Inner Mongolia in order to realize their dream of a continental policy. Since December of last year, they have gradually been immigrating to Jilin Province. The area around Hailong River, formerly inhabited by Koreans and originally called Hailong River, is now renamed Xin'an Town. In this town and its surrounding areas, the Japanese forced the Koreans to relocate and occupied the area. They also established an agency there, headed by an official called a "Political Instructor," who controls all local administration. All the land has been divided up, and our compatriots have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Policy of Slaughter: The residents of various places in the Northeast have historically lived in settlements formed by clans, divided into small and large villages. The Japanese immediately drove the residents of small villages into large villages. Those who did not comply had their villages burned down, or their fields and industries were slaughtered in the name of the Volunteer Army. Among them, they especially hated the people of Shandong. If they could apply to the Japanese to enter the pass and return to their hometown, they were especially welcomed; otherwise, they would be slaughtered, not in the name of the Volunteer Army, but in the name of the Communist Party. In the early part of last month, the Shandong and Zhili Associations funded the entry of more than 10,000 people into the pass to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Conscription and Militia Training: Since January 1st of this year, the Japanese army has implemented a policy of conscription and militia training. Families with three adult males had two conscripted to train as reserve troops. Families with one adult male had him conscripted into the militia to protect the local area. The purpose of the conscripted troops was to attack the Chinese and seize Chinese land. The entire family also had to take a photo as proof. If there was any suspicion, the entire family would be killed. Anyone who did not want to be conscripted was charged with disobeying orders and sentenced to death. Furthermore, the Japanese were very respectful to Chinese who could eat opium, considering them to be rich people. Those who sold one or two taels of opium were sentenced to imprisonment for half a year or three to two years. Those who sold ten or one hundred taels were not guilty. This policy of encouraging opium consumption is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our nation. It is truly outrageous to speak of.</p>
<p>Changing Ideology: Chinese people residing in the northeastern provinces, within the scope of the Japanese, should pay attention to the Way of the King ideology, practice kneeling and bowing, and shout "Long Live." Those with new ideas were considered reactionaries. Young children were forced to enter Japanese schools to instill Japanese thought and abolish Chinese learning. Countless events aimed at destroying our nation are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Sowing Discord Among the Chinese: It was reported a few days ago that our Commanders-in-Chief Wang Delin and Kong Xianrong had organized the East China Republic. This matter is absolutely untrue. The name "East China Republic" was produced last year. Our two Commanders-in-Chief looked down on it with extreme contempt, believing that patriotic individuals should save the country through practical action, and that there was no need to establish another name. These rumors were all created by the Japanese in Harbin to sow discord among the Chinese. Commanders Wang and Kong firmly instructed me to come to Shanghai to announce this to the people of the country. Everything has factual evidence to prove it. Please do not believe it lightly.</p>
<p>Departing for Defense After Completion: My mission to Shanghai this time has been as described above. I do not want to delay too much in Shanghai. After staying for a few days, I will return to the defense area to report and continue my unfinished work. I hope that the people of the country will rise up unitedly, care for our northeastern compatriots, and rescue them from the depths of misery. Even if our army has only one soldier and one gun, we will fight to the death to exchange the blood of our soldiers for the sympathy of the people of the country, and to cultivate the seeds for recovering the lost territories of the Northeast in the future, they said.</p>

Now, summoned by telegram from Chairman Chiang, he returned to the country on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, arriving in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. His wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, and his daughter are still residing in England and did not accompany him back to the country.

<p>Landing Situation: The welcoming boats arrived near the China Merchants Bureau's central wharf at 4:05 PM, alongside the Conte Verde ship. At that time, the large ship had stopped and turned around. A small ladder was lowered so that Mr. Zhang could disembark first. Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Feng Yong, boarded the special boat to greet him at 4:10 PM. As for the former subordinates who accompanied Mr. Zhang to Shanghai, they disembarked at the Gonghexing Wharf. After Mr. Zhang boarded the small boat, he shook hands with Jiang Bocheng, Mayor Wu, Director Yang, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others to express his thanks. He also waved to the welcoming personnel on the Jinghui and other boats to express his gratitude. The boat then set sail and arrived at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund of Aiduya Road at 4:25 PM amidst laughter. He thanked all the welcoming personnel again at the wharf, took photographs, and then took car No. 2735 back to his residence at No. 2 Molilai Road at 4:30 PM to rest.</p>
<p>Accompanied Personnel: Those who returned to the country from Europe with Mr. Zhang yesterday included only Mr. Zhang's French secretary, Shen Zutong, and two others.

When he met with the group of reporters, he only spoke for about ten minutes, with a smiling face and a very sincere attitude.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Remarks: Because many relatives, friends, and former subordinates visited Mr. Zhang yesterday, he only spoke with the reporters for about ten minutes. Mr. Zhang first stated that he was very sorry for not having enough time for a long conversation due to the large number of guests. If the reporters had any questions, he would answer them in writing in the future. He then said that his return to the country this time was due to a private telegram from Chairman Chiang. Rumors that he would hold any important position were mostly speculations. He was very interested in aviation and planned to rest in Shanghai for a while before visiting Chairman Chiang. As for returning to North China to preside over military and political affairs, it was impossible. Mr. Zhang continued that he had gained many impressions and feelings during his trip to Europe, which could not be fully expressed in a few words. As for whether fascism could be suitable for China, it still needed to be studied. The occurrence and establishment of a political system must have its historical background and must be suitable for the nation's national character. We cannot copy it and rashly apply it. Mr. Zhang concluded that he was a citizen of China, and he left the country for China and returned to the country for China, seeking only to fulfill his responsibilities as a citizen. His proposition for saving the country was the same as before, which was the four words "Peace and Unification."</p>

<p>Wang Jialie and You Guocai Join Hands</p>
<p>A New Sound News Agency report states that since Wang Jialie replaced Mao Guangxiang as the head of the Guizhou provincial government, You Guocai, because his prestige was similar to Wang's, wanted to replace him, which led to months of fierce fighting the year before last. In early December of last year, Che Mingyi and others, former subordinates of Mao Guangxiang in eastern Guizhou, started another disturbance. Wang Jialie's troops, led by Bai Jianru, suppressed the disturbance. It was also rumored that You Guocai's troops in western Guizhou would start another war. After Dan Maoxin and He Zhizhong, commander of the First Division, personally negotiated with him, they reconciled. Yesterday, people from Guizhou in Shanghai received a telegram from the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters detailing the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>End of the War: Che Mingyi, Yang Qichang, Lei Mingjiu, and other troops, originally stationed in the counties of Tongren, Jiangkou, and Cengong on the Hunan border, took the opportunity to occupy Sinan and Zhenyuan counties in December of last year when Wang Jialie was conducting a military inspection. At that time, Wang did not send troops to attack because the You troops in the west were unstable. Che, Yang, and others then disturbed Yujiang, Shiqian, Sinan, and Yuqing. Wang recruited and sent a large army to attack, commanded by division commander Bai Jianru. The various troops of Wan, Zhang, Liao, and Pi surrounded and suppressed them. They then recovered Zhenyuan and attacked Tongren. Che and Yang concentrated their forces at Longjingao, relying on the terrain to resist in a final struggle. Bai's division detoured a small part of the army to Shengxi to surround Tongren, while he personally led the main army to rush to Ma'anshan and launch a fierce attack on Longjingao. After a day of bloody battle, Che and Yang's main force was completely destroyed. Che Mingyi heard the report and urgently dispatched reinforcements to aid them. At the same time, the left wing of Bai's division, Zhang Yuanxun's troops, had already attacked and captured Shiqian and advanced forward. They met Che's reinforcements, Yang and Lei's troops, and fought each other for several hours, defeating them and capturing Che's secretary-general and four generals, as well as countless weapons and ammunition. At this time, the right-wing troops of Bai's division also detoured out of the enemy's rear from Shengxi and occupied Tongren. Che and Yang were unable to advance or retreat, and the entire army collapsed. The war in the east was over.</p>
<p>Wang and You Reconcile: As for You Guocai's troops, after the end of the previous Guizhou war, they retreated to Yunnan and then returned to Panjiang Ba Shu. At the end of November of last year, they took advantage of the changing situation to collude with foreign aid and attempt to seize the provincial government. Recently, Wang Jialie invited Dan Maoxin, a senior figure in the military and political circles, and He Zhizhong, commander of the First Division of the 25th Army, to meet with You at Pingjietang. After several negotiations, they reached an agreement and decided to join hands and work together for the political construction of Guizhou Province.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Railways Plan Sino-American Water-Land Through Transport <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Our Side Drafts a Draft Plan for Through Transport</p>
<p>The U.S. Will Send Personnel to China to Discuss Implementation</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Railways signed a contract with the National Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other companies to test out water-land through transport, the results were very good. It will continue to promote it throughout the country to facilitate transportation. A reporter from the China Times News Agency learned from transportation circles yesterday that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways, in view of the fact that American cotton will continue to be shipped to China, and that international transportation matters are also becoming numerous, in order to facilitate transportation and recover profit rights, will prepare for Sino-American water-land through transport. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Planning Sino-American Through Transport: After the Ministry of Railways jointly handled water-land through transport with the Ministry of Communications, the transportation was facilitated, and the business increased suddenly. In view of the fact that a large amount of American cotton and wheat was ordered by our country to be shipped to China, the amount of shipping fees lost was quite large. In the future, there will also be a lot of goods ordered from foreign countries to China. In order to save the situation, a method was jointly agreed upon by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications to order two larger ocean liners from the United States through the China Merchants Bureau to prepare for the transport of American wheat and to prepare for the future implementation of direct through transport.</p>
<p>The U.S. Side Expresses Approval: After the plan was announced, the Bevie Shipping Company, which is operated by the U.S. government, recently telegraphed the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications of our country, requesting that the transport of American wheat to China be handled by the company. After receiving the telegram, our side believed that this request seemed to conflict with our country's commercial transport rights. Since there was no proper contact between Sino-American shipping, if the company cooperated well with our government to handle Sino-American through transport, it would benefit a lot. Therefore, a joint telegram was sent to the company, proposing detailed methods for Sino-American water-land through transport and seeking their consent. According to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, the U.S. side has already replied by telegram, expressing its full approval in principle. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications have been planning separately for implementation.</p>
<p>Both Sides Fully Cooperate in Principle: As for the method of Sino-American through transport, it is said that it will be based on the principle of mutual benefit and cooperation, so that all goods transported between China and the United States can be reduced in transportation costs compared to the general transportation costs. As for the detailed methods, due to the importance of the matter, it will be discussed in detail by both parties, taking into account the interests of all parties and the actual situation, and then agreed upon.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to China for Consultation: It is now known that after the U.S. side sent a telegram expressing its approval, in order to facilitate implementation, it has agreed to send a special representative to China to consult with the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications of our country on implementation methods and procedures. Our side has already sent a telegram expressing its welcome and inquiring about the exact date of the representative's arrival in China so that a meeting can be scheduled to discuss the matter, so that the Sino-American through transport business can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e92">American Cotton and Wheat Arrive <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>He Molin Returns Home Today</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局), in order to transport a large amount of American cotton and wheat, specially appointed He Molin to go to the United States to charter ships. He has now successfully completed the task and returned home. The third and fourth batches of large quantities of American wheat have also successively arrived in Shanghai. Mr. He arrived in Shanghai this morning. He Molin, the head of the business department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was dispatched to the United States last November to Portland to negotiate ship charters for the purpose of transporting 660,000 tons of cotton and wheat to Shanghai. Half of the shipments were required to be on American ships, while the other half, consisting of 200,000 tons of Sino-American cotton and 130,000 tons of American wheat, could be transported by ships from other countries. After arriving in the United States, Mr. He contacted ship owners from various countries to negotiate ship charters in order to obtain the lowest possible freight rates. He chartered ships with a total tonnage of 400,000 tons, and this has now been fully completed. Mr. He has also left the United States and returned home, aboard the President Cleveland of the Dollar Steamship Lines (大來洋行). He is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:30 this morning, and will disembark at the New Customs Wharf on a small launch sent by Dollar Steamship Lines to pick up passengers. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the report yesterday and sent personnel to welcome him today. Upon his arrival in Shanghai, Mr. He will resume his position as the head of the business department. Mr. He's trip to the United States has saved the company tens of thousands of dollars in ship charter costs alone, truly demonstrating his hard work and great contributions. Three Batches of Wheat Arrive Of the American wheat that has been imported, there have been four ships arriving in two separate shipments, totaling over 33,000 tons. There are currently three more ships unloading within the Huangpu River. The third batch of American wheat, carried by the British ship Ferndale, totaling 7,542 tons, was received by telegraph yesterday, stating that it would arrive in Shanghai for import today. The wheat has already been sold to various flour mills, so it will not be stored in warehouses and will instead be delivered directly from the ship. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided that the ship would be berthed at wharf number 36.7 for unloading, and notified the recipients to send barges to pick it up. Fourth Batch Delayed The fourth batch of American wheat has also been shipped from the United States. According to reports from Portland, the fourth shipment of American wheat to Shanghai was loaded on December 8th in the United States. As usual, it should arrive within the next two or three days. Among them, 7,832 tons are carried by the Jiradentes, but due to encountering wind and fog en route, it was unable to arrive in Shanghai on the scheduled date. It was not until yesterday afternoon that confirmed news was received that the fourth batch of American wheat is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th. At the same time, another 8,950 tons of wheat, carried by the Haleric Tang, will also be imported at that time.</p>
<p>Cotton Continues to Arrive American cotton financed by loans from the New Asia United Transportation Company, carried by the Pacific Company's City of King, totaling 5,000 bales, worth approximately 75,600 National currency (國幣), is currently en route. A telegram was received yesterday stating that the ship is also scheduled to arrive on the 13th. The American cotton on board will be unloaded at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chinese warehouse in Pudong.</p>

<p>Commercial Shares Should Be Fully Paid Up in About Ten Days</p>
<p>The China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, which was established as a result of the grain conference of eight provinces and cities, has been in the preparatory stage for more than a month. The director of the preparatory office, Gu Qingyi, and the deputy director, Wu Hengru, consider grain transportation and sales to be an essential plan for the revitalization of rural areas, and therefore are actively and tirelessly carrying out the work of the bureau. A reporter from the New News Agency (新新社) visited Mr. Gu at the preparatory office yesterday morning to inquire about the recent progress. According to him, the share payments from the provinces and cities have been successively received, totaling more than 450,000 yuan. Those that have not yet been remitted to Shanghai have been urged by letter to pay quickly. It is expected that all payments will be completed around the 10th of this month. As for the official shares of one million yuan, they have been allocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang Headquarters. Once the share payments are collected, a shareholders' meeting will be convened immediately so that the bureau can be established as soon as possible.

The central army has been winning victories in Zhejiang and Fujian, and the rebel army is not difficult to eliminate. From the current situation, the establishment of the bureau will not be affected.</p>

<p>The Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee received a telegram yesterday from the Shandong Disaster Relief Committee stating that, regarding the addition of soup kitchens, the sixth meeting of the committee resolved that in the six areas where famine refugees are concentrated, namely Fan County, Pu County, Chou Zhang, Yanggu, Dongping, and Jiqing, each kitchen, in addition to the existing ones, should be given an additional 3,000 yuan, totaling 18,000 yuan. Dongping has a particularly large number of famine refugees, so an additional soup kitchen should be set up, with soup kitchen expenses of 7,672 yuan. The six factories in Fan County and other places will be managed by the original personnel, without increasing staff. The newly added Dongping soup kitchen will be managed by a committee recommended by the local charitable organizations, under the supervision and direction of the investigation and release office, with a small amount of subsidies given, but no salaries paid, in order to save expenses and purchase more firewood and rice to expand disaster relief and benefit the people in need. The budget of 25,672 yuan is in accordance with the actual situation, and has been fully approved and recorded.

<p>The City Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union Have Already Sent Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>The Su Shen Glasses Frame Production Cooperative, located on Yu Gang Road, Xibao Xing Road, Zhabei, employs more than 400 workers. Due to the sluggish business and the approaching end of the lunar year, more than 200 workers have been given money by the company to return to their hometowns. More than 100 workers are still working in the factory. Recently, due to a rental dispute with the landlord, a lawsuit was filed in court, which has not yet been decided. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, the owner of the house secretly asked the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to send three policemen to the factory to expel all the workers outside, and to seal the front and back doors, as well as the dormitory and cafeteria. As a result, the workers have no place to live and their livelihoods are in danger. Yesterday morning at 10:00, more than 50 workers jointly went to the City Party Headquarters to petition, asking for assistance. Yu Yaoqiu of the Investigation Section received them and, after inquiring about the situation, agreed to go to the General Labor Union to petition. Wan Bangge received them, and his response was the same. It was originally planned to go to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Center to petition, but due to lack of time, they will go again today.</p>
<p>The Factory Reports The Shanghai Glasses Frame Production Cooperative and the Su Shen Hawksbill Glasses Hehe Society submitted a report to the party and government agencies yesterday, stating that at 1:00 p.m. on the 5th of this month, Yang Qingru, the rent collector of Chen Guanji's rented house, led four policemen and the doorman A Er, first entered the General Office and expelled the employee Ge Jinming and three other trainees from the company. Two of the policemen returned first, and the rest helped Yang Qingru and A Er to cut off all the door locks with axes. Then, they completely nailed up the front and back doors and windows, as well as the dormitory and dining room (excerpt). The rental dispute between the Su Shen Cooperative and Chen Guanji's rental office had already been decided by the Shanghai District Court, which rejected Chen Guanji's lawsuit for eviction. As for the rent portion, each party was released in court, and Chen Guanji was ordered to repair the house within 15 days. Once the repair work is completed, the rent will be paid as usual, but he has not come to repair it, and instead sealed it up. The employees are displaced and the business is suspended. Therefore, in addition to hiring lawyer Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit according to law, we sincerely request that you send personnel to thoroughly investigate and uphold justice, so as to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p>The Authorities Investigate After receiving the report from the factory and the workers, the City Party Headquarters, because it concerns the people's freedom of residence and the workers' livelihood, sent Yu Yaoqiu, an official of the Investigation Section, and Wan Banghe, an official of the General Labor Union, to the Baziqiao Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, and around the factory buildings to inquire separately, so that they can report back to the superiors for a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Thugs Caught on Small Boat, Firearms Confiscated <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Liu Decheng, Tan Jinhai, and Xu Zhiqing of the Disraeli Road Police Station apprehended Xu Dazhi, a native of Siyang, and a woman named Wang Zhang, from a small boat parked in the Feilun Road riverbank. They confiscated two pistols and thirty-six bullets. Later, they captured Zhou Desheng, a Jiangbei native and accomplice, at No. 9 Yuezhou Road. Investigation revealed that Xu and Zhou, along with a Wang named leader who is still at large, were involved in the robbery of 160 yuan in wages issued by the China Iron Factory at No. 332, Huasheng Road on November 15 last year. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Liu Yugui conducted a trial at the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that the defendants Xu Dazhi and Wang Zhang admitted that the firearms and ammunition belonged to Wang Zhang's lover, Wang Desheng. At the time, he used a yarn wide belt to wrap it around his waist and brought it into the boat, handing it over to Xu for safekeeping, saying that he would take it back to his hometown for robbery. The defendants Xu and Zhou also directly admitted to going to the Huasheng Road Iron Factory robbery and watching the wind nearby. The robbers Zhang Xiaodeyu, Chen Rongwen, and Zhou Xiaoliuzi, who were previously arrested by the Yulin Road Police Station, have already been punished. These people all claimed that they did not know the defendants Xu and Zhou, so no proposal was made. The firearms and ammunition waist belt were presented for inspection, and it was requested that they be severely punished according to the law. After the iron factory representative Lu Yunqing testified, the defendants were questioned. The confession was similar to the statement of the police lawyer Wang. Judge Liu appointed lawyer Lin Yingqing to act as the defendant's representative, requesting a lenient sentence. The court ordered that they be returned to custody separately and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Xu Qingyu Speaks on the Trajectory of Thought <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association invited Mr. Xu Qingyu to speak on the Trajectory of Thought the night before last. The Bingxun Shorthand Agency sent personnel to take shorthand notes on the spot. The main points of his speech were divided into three points: (1) We must recognize the importance of thought issues. The source of China's chaos is due to the errors in the thinking of the general public. To save the country in the future, we should start by correcting the people's thinking. (2) The enlightenment and tempering of thought. To enlighten thought, we should often reflect in silence, or have the stimulation of objective environment. To temper thought, we should first temper the body, and then thought can be sound. (3) We should not echo others, but should believe in the correct doctrine and sacrifice and fight to find a way out for the country and ourselves.</p>

<p>Cancellation of Fourth-Class Tickets from Weiting to Suzhou</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has been selling fourth-class passenger tickets from Weiting to Suzhou since June 20 last year. However, it has been found that most of these passengers are employees of Weiting who travel between Weiting and Guandu Li, and few go to Suzhou. Therefore, the Transportation Department now plans to cancel fourth-class tickets from Weiting to Suzhou and instead sell fourth-class tickets from Weiting to Guandu Li, with a fare temporarily set at one jiao. This has been approved by the Railway Bureau for a three-month trial period.</p>

<p>Issued a Special Message to Fellow Citizens at Sea Yesterday</p>
<p>Expressing His Spirit of Perseverance and Struggle</p>
<p>General Jiang Minsheng, who shines shoes, has recently been the target of fabricated facts and rumors spread by outsiders to damage his reputation. Yesterday, he issued a special message to his fellow citizens at sea, expressing his spirit of perseverance and struggle. The original text is reproduced below: To all my fellow citizens at sea, Minsheng has come to the sea and has received the help of all my fellow citizens, which has made me what I am today. I am deeply grateful. However, I also want to report to you the pain I have gone through in these past few months. In the past, there was "temptation," "intimidation," and "assassination." Recently, there has been "oppression," "encirclement," "framing," and the spreading of rumors or fabricated facts in letters, etc., in order to kill Minsheng. I am not willing to give in. However, even with such danger, it does not affect all of Minsheng's work. I have made up my mind to fight for the country and the nation at all costs. As for life, personality, and reputation, I will let people destroy them and not care about them at all. I am even more determined that the Northeast is my hometown, and the refugees in the Northeast are my life's ambition. I will work hard for my hometown, fight for my life, follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, stand under the flag of the Republic of China, and follow the officials of the government to save the country from danger. Jiang Minsheng bows respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Anti-Tuberculosis Society Discusses China's Alarming Tuberculosis Situation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Zhang Junjun to Mayor Wu</p>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association's Letter to Mayor Wu Discussing Tuberculosis Prevention reads: Respected Mayor of Iron City,</p>
<p>With utmost respect, since your esteemed self initiated this association, participation from all quarters has been exceptionally enthusiastic. All persons with even a slight sense of national consciousness sympathize, with a great hope of enabling us to ascend to longevity together. This proves that your call from a high place evokes responses from ten thousand mountains. Without the advocacy of someone of high virtue and prestige, how could this be achieved? The work of "reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone" cannot be mentioned in the same breath as building a seven-story pagoda. However, the rampant state of tuberculosis in China must be roughly outlined to clarify the truth. Medical science recognizes two particularly interesting diseases. One is leprosy, which decreases with cultural advancement. The other is tuberculosis, which increases with cultural advancement. That is, the day culture reaches its zenith is also the time when tuberculosis spreads wildly. The response is immediate and cannot be avoided. If we do not take preventive measures in advance, the destruction of the nation will inevitably materialize along with its destructive tide. China has always been a country lagging in health knowledge. More than 98% of adult men and women are threatened by the tuberculosis bacillus. Those with strong vitality can resist the ravages of the tuberculosis bacillus and have strength to spare. However, it is a pity that the general frail people have weak physical strength and mediocre vitality. Once the tuberculosis army launches occasional attacks, they will inevitably collapse, surrender, and have no time to resist. If the country is like this, what will become of the country? If the nation is like this, the people will perish. Every time I think of this, I shudder. The current situation is not merely about lightly addressing tuberculosis prevention. It is a matter of life and death for the nation, and it should not be taken lightly. According to our accurate statistics, the world's tuberculosis death rate, using 100,000 people as a unit, is 51 in New Zealand, 72 in Egypt, 79 in the United States, 86 in Germany, 102 in the United Kingdom, 136 in Spain, 148 in Italy, 175 in France, and 186 in Japan. However, China's tuberculosis death rate reaches 307 people. China's death rate is six times that of New Zealand, four times that of Egypt and the United States, three and a half times that of Germany, three times that of the United Kingdom, two and a half times that of Spain, twice that of Italy, and one and a half times that of France and Japan. Alas, the vast power of tuberculosis in China! The index of 307 people is based on the survey conducted by the First Health Bureau of Beiping in the 18th year of the Republic of China. However, this number cannot be considered China's tuberculosis death rate. Beiping's climate is the most suitable climate for health in the country. Even with the superiority of Beiping's climate, 307 out of every 100,000 people are captured by the tuberculosis army. Then, the increase in numbers south of the Yangtze River, where the climate is not suitable for the nation's health, should not be surprising. We can understand the close relationship between the climate of the north and south and the nation's health by observing the very obvious difference in the death rates of children in the north and south. The death rate of children in the north and south is always in a ratio of two to one. In other words, one death in the north means two deaths in the south; fifty deaths in the north mean one hundred deaths in the south. Therefore, the danger to life for southerners is always greater than for northerners. Insurance companies are extremely strict in their inspections of southerners' insurance applications, and the premiums are increased by another 10%. This is not without reason. There is no doubt that the number of southerners who die from tuberculosis far exceeds that of northerners. We have synthesized reports from various sources, and China's tuberculosis death rate should be above 425. Furthermore, if one out of every ten people with the disease dies, then there should be 4,000 people with tuberculosis out of every 100,000. With a population of 400 million in China, there should be 16 million people with the disease nationwide. In other words, one in every 25 people in China has the disease. The number of tuberculosis patients who die in China every year is no less than 1.6 million. There are 365 days in a year, 24 hours a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. There are a total of 525,600 minutes in a year. The number of tuberculosis patients who die per minute is three, and every ten minutes is thirty. From this analogy, we may be able to understand the meaning of numbers to a small extent. Not only that, but China currently has 16 million tuberculosis experts, each of whom is responsible for spreading tuberculosis bacilli to an average of ten people. In one year, China can easily produce 160 million patients. Increasing in this way, the entire Chinese nation can easily fall into an irreparable tragedy in a short period of time. Therefore, the tuberculosis situation in China is becoming increasingly serious and far exceeds the bombing of Japanese planes and the blockade of each army. If we do not take measures early, carry out remedial treatment for those who are already ill, and implement tuberculosis prevention education for those who are not ill, then not only will the stigma of "sick man of East Asia" not be washed away even in the slightest, but the lifeline of the nation will also be severed. Fortunately, your esteemed self and celebrities from all walks of life have foresight and unique vision, and you have built an immortal achievement. You have spared no effort in calling for the nation to awaken to the consciousness of self-rescue and rescue others, and you have organized the Anti-Tuberculosis Association. The methods are beautiful, and they are worthy of admiration. However, this matter concerns the survival of the entire nation, and it cannot be achieved by one hand or one foot. Therefore, the entire nation must participate and cooperate fully in order to have an effect in the shortest period of time. We are aware of this, so we have specially sent this humble letter to implore your esteemed self to immediately order all public and private institutions, organizations, and schools under your jurisdiction to join together and carry out anti-tuberculosis work together to promote it and facilitate its progress. We pray for this, and respectfully offer this to you. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhang Junjun, Director-General</p>

<p>First Voyage on the 10th of This Month</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Qingdao has mostly been operated by Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. Among Chinese companies, only the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company operates the Shanghai-Qingdao route. In order to facilitate travel between Shanghai and Qingdao, Sanbei Company has decided to dedicate the Jing'an ship to the Shanghai-Qingdao route, with the first voyage scheduled for the 10th of this month. According to inquiries made by a Xin Sheng News reporter to the company, the Jing'an ship was purchased from the Ministry of the Navy and is an excellent and fast ship. It has sailed the Northern Seas route many times. The ship is magnificent, the cabins are spacious, and the speed is fast, which is well known to people from all walks of life. Recently, the company has carefully repaired it, not only making it faster but also renewing its appearance. All passenger facilities, from the dining room to the steerage, have been improved to perfection. In order to facilitate the transportation of goods and passengers for Chinese merchants in Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, and other ports, this ship will now be fixed to sail between Qingdao and Shanghai every Tuesday evening after this maiden voyage to Qingdao, loading cargo and passengers. The ship will dock at the Ning Shao Wharf at the 16th pier.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Buddhist Laymen's Forest Establishes Poor People's Capital Lending Office <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Layman Bao Yin Generously Donates 8,000 Yuan in Total</p>
<p>Rules and Regulations Are Being Drafted, Opening Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Laymen's Forest, recognizing that there are many poor people in Shanghai since the war, many of whom are willing to make a living but are suffering from hunger and cold due to economic difficulties, has specially established a Poor People's Livelihood Capital Lending Office to start lending loans immediately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Establishment: Last month, a person named Layman Bao Yin sent a letter to the Forest, stating that disaster areas are all over the country, and relief is being provided everywhere. Although a piece of clothing or a meal can relieve the urgent need for a while, it is difficult to maintain it consistently. The power of relief is limited, and the difficulties of waiting for relief are endless. He planned to carry out fundamental measures, using a certain amount of cash to save a certain number of disaster victims, so that the recipients can ultimately be saved and receive real benefits, preserving their lives, and so on. After receiving the letter, the Forest replied, expressing its approval. After receiving the reply, Layman Bao Yin immediately donated 3,000 yuan to Shanghai for the Forest to implement.</p>
<p>Opening in Shanghai First: After receiving this donation, the Forest, led by Forest Director Layman Wang Yiting, together with executive directors Li Jingwei, Zhu Shisheng, Zeng Yousheng, and Forest Directors Huang Hanzhi and Guan Jiongzhi, consulted with major philanthropists in Shanghai who have experience in handling relief affairs. They believed that disaster areas are widespread, and the amount of money is still small. It is difficult to satisfy everyone's needs. After the January 28th Incident, Zhabei in Shanghai was badly damaged, and there were unemployed poor people everywhere. It is better to start with Shanghai first. According to the results of the consultation, they sent a letter to Layman Bao Yin. In addition to replying with approval, Layman Bao Yin also remitted another 5,000 yuan on the 28th of last month to increase the amount.</p>
<p>Loan Capital Measures: Forest Director Layman Wang Yiting also convened the 69th Standing Committee meeting of the Forest on the 28th of last month. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to establish a Shanghai Poor People's Livelihood Capital Lending Office. Li Jingwei and ten other people were publicly elected to draft the Loan Capital Regulations, Loan Capital Measures, and internal operating procedures, which can be implemented immediately. Those who are truly honest, stable, and lack capital to make a living can borrow capital from the office through the introduction of a Forest friend and obtaining reliable guarantees. The loan limit is said to be between five and twenty-five yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Home of Beirunsheng, A Major Paint Merchant, Was Bombed for the Second Time <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The First Time Was on November 18th of Last Year</p>
<p>No One Was Injured in Either Incident, and the Police Are Investigating</p>
<p>Beirunsheng, a major paint merchant from Suzhou, lives in Building No. 5, Lane 25, Belle Road, French Concession, with the main gate facing Huage Nie Road. On the evening of November 18th of last year, at around 7 pm, someone threw a bomb and bombed it once. At that time, only a few window frames were damaged. Unexpectedly, at 6:10 pm last night, it was bombed for the second time. One bomb landed near the east wall of the garden and exploded immediately, with a loud bang that shook the neighborhood. Fortunately, no one was injured. The servant Li Guangyin discovered it and reported it to the owner. At the same time, the French police, having heard the news, dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They collected the fragments of the exploded bomb shell and took them to the police station for file and investigation. They also ordered all detectives to quickly investigate and arrest the person who threw the bomb and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Xu Yuying's Case Against Ji Juemi Was Still Closed to the Public Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Verbal Debate Ended Yesterday</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 15th</p>
<p>The case of Ji Juemi being sued for obscenity was heard in the First Special District District Court on December 22nd of last year. Both parties were summoned and interrogated. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing. At around 2 pm, the plaintiff, young woman Xu Yuying, and her legal guardian, Xu Li, the defendant Ji Juemi, Yu Xiaomei, and the lawyers representing both parties arrived at the Third Tribunal of the court to wait for the hearing. However, the presiding judge, Xiao Xiefei, decided to continue to prohibit public attendance because the case concerned morality. Before the hearing, he transferred many Chinese and Western bailiffs to guard the entrance of the courtroom. Except for the parties, witnesses, and lawyers of both parties, no one was allowed to enter the court to attend the hearing. The restrictions were even stricter than during the first trial. Therefore, from the opening of the court at around 2 pm to the closing of the court at 5:30 pm, there were only a few people in the court: the judge, the clerk, the litigants, the lawyers, the witnesses, and a court clerk, as well as the guarding bailiffs. The atmosphere was so quiet that it broke the court's record for hearing cases. However, the general public who went to attend the hearing, although they were refused entry, mostly adopted the attitude of "since we are here, let's stay." They gathered outside the court, as if waiting for something. When they heard the announcement of adjournment, they all dispersed. The details of the trial were also impossible to find out due to the strict gatekeeping. However, it is known that the testimony of witnesses has been completed, and the verbal debate has also ended yesterday. Sentencing is scheduled for the afternoon of the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e114">A Laborer Died of Coal Gas Poisoning After Closing the Door and Burning Coal Briquettes <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>｜A Warning to Those Who Use Coal Briquettes for Heating｜</p>
<p>No. 35 Yuyuan Lane, Yuyuan Road, is a newly built house. A laborer named Dou Huahua, from Tongzhou, 30 years old, was assigned to watch the house. Because the weather has been cold recently, Dou borrowed a coal briquette stove for heating and placed it in his bedroom. The night before, he closed the windows and doors tightly and burned coal briquettes. Dou fell asleep peacefully. Unexpectedly, the gas could not escape and filled the room. Dou was poisoned by coal gas and gradually became unconscious. The next morning, the foreman Luo Yourong saw that Dou had not gotten up yet, so he went to knock on the door, but there was no response after repeated calls. Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately tried to open the door and suddenly saw Dou lying stiff on the bed. He felt that he was no longer breathing, so he immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and ordered detectives to investigate. After investigation, they immediately sent his car to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was taken to the Filun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District District Court, visited the morgue to examine the body. After hearing Luo Yourong's report of the previous situation, Guo ruled that the deceased Dou Huahua had died of coal gas poisoning. The body was handed over to his father, Dou Fengsheng, who signed a statement to take it back for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Bridegroom Failed to Arrive Because of National Affairs, and Two Women Worshipped in the Wedding Hall <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Younger Sister Acted as the Groom, Paying Homage to Heaven and Earth</p>
<p>A Fake Couple Entered the Bridal Chamber Together</p>
<p>Shen Jinxiang, 56 years old, a farmer and resident of No. 11 Shenjia Lane, northwest of Taixing Temple Bridge, Wusong, has a second son named Rongxi, 22 years old, who works as a servant for an American in the United States. He has been there for four or five years. Rongxi was engaged to Li Ashi's daughter Axiu, 20 years old, a villager of the Li Family Residence, through the matchmaking of Chen Youqian and Chen Asi since childhood, but they have not been married. This autumn, Shen Jinxiang thought that Rongxi was old enough and should get married, so he specially hired a fortune teller to choose the 16th of this month in the lunar calendar as the wedding date. He sent a letter to the United States, urging Rongxi to return home in time for the wedding. It was not until the wedding date was approaching that he received a reply from Rongxi, stating that he did not have time to return home and would have to wait until the 20th day of the first month of the lunar new year to return home. Shen Jinxiang was very unhappy after receiving the letter. The villagers valued superstitions, believing that the wedding date chosen by the fortune teller should not be changed, lest it be unfavorable. Moreover, the date was approaching, and everything needed had been prepared. However, Rongxi was far away in a foreign country and could not be rushed back immediately. In this dilemma, he had a strange idea and ordered his youngest daughter, A'mei, 13 years old, to temporarily act as the bridegroom for her brother and hold the wedding ceremony at that time. Therefore, on that day, the Shen family hung lanterns and streamers and held a grand banquet. Many relatives and friends arrived, and it was very lively. When the bridal sedan arrived, amidst the sound of drums and music, A'mei, dressed in a gown and short jacket, a fake bridegroom, actually appeared in the wedding hall. However, she was tall and looked like a young man. Because most of the rural areas still use the old methods, this fake couple paid homage to heaven and earth and entered the bridal chamber together. The men and women in the surrounding villages heard that two women were getting married, which was a rare piece of news, so the audience was extremely crowded. It is said that although the bride has become a formal daughter-in-law, she is still sleeping alone in the bridal chamber because the groom has not returned.</p>

<p>The Procurator to step forward and present his opinion, stating that Su Kunnian and Shao Pengfei, in the spring of this year, jointly established Hezhong Company, colluding with Jianghai Customs clerks Shi Cunqiao, Wei Anxiang, Jiang Zhenhan, Zhang Songtao, Sun Guozhang, Chen Zhongshan, Han Jincai, Tan Miaofa, and declaration clerks Wang Jianyun, Qian Weiming, Xiong Ansheng, He Xianzhong, Deng Xiaoshan, Chen Amao, and a Mr. Chen from China Ruifeng, Yuxiang, Huajia, Xincheng, Kaili, and Deji to conspire to embezzle tax money. They regularly met at a pre-arranged hotel on the Fourth Road. Shi Cunqiao and others would steal blank red and green tax forms printed by Customs. Su Kunnian and Shao Pengfei would then counterfeit them, resembling genuine Customs tax forms obtained by declaration clerks, and stamp them with forged Customs seals. They would then give them to declaration clerks such as Wang Jianyun who possessed genuine forms. The declaration clerks would keep the genuine forms and submit the forged forms with lower tax amounts to designated Customs banks. The difference between the tax amounts on the genuine forms and the forged forms would be pocketed and divided (25% to Hezhong Company, 35% to Customs clerks, and 40% to declaration clerks). After the forged forms were submitted to Customs, the clerks would secretly extract the original forms and replace them with the forged forms for concealment. When declaration clerk Chen Amao stopped working, they consulted with Chen Guoliang to take over, who still relied on Amao for assistance and shared the spoils. According to evidence discovered, Deng Xiaoshan of Yuxingxiang declaration firm embezzled 9,556.53 taels of tax money (calculated in Customs Gold Units, each tael worth 2.026 yuan in national currency) on April 19, April 21, May 10, May 13, and July 3 of the 20th year. He Xianzhong of Xincheng Firm embezzled 3,444.96 taels of tax money on March 28 and sometime in May of the 22nd year. Chen Amao and Chen Guoliang, of the China Soap Company embezzled 4,662.49 taels of tax money sometime in May of the 22nd year. Wang Jianyun of Ruifeng Transportation Company embezzled 7,780.75 taels of tax money on June 26 and July 14 of the 22nd year. Mr. Chen of Deji Foreign Firm embezzled a total of 19,547.42 taels of tax money on April 11, sometime in May, June 8, May 13, and June 14 of the 22nd year. Xiong Ansheng of Huajia Foreign Firm embezzled 26,551.38 taels of tax money on March 1, March 9, April 24, June 14, and June 17 of the 22nd year. Qian Weiming of Kaili Foreign Firm embezzled 1,872.46 taels of tax money on April 11 of the 22nd year, totaling 73,415.99 taels of tax money embezzled from various firms, which was divided among the defendants. After the case was exposed, the above nine defendants were apprehended. Shi Cunqiao, Wang Yueren, and Wei Anxiang admitted to stealing Customs paper, namely blank red and green tax forms, and swapping genuine and fake tax forms. Jiang Zhenhan and Zhang Songtao only admitted to being aware of the scheme. Sun Guozhang and Chen Zhongshan denied any knowledge. Chen Guoliang admitted to entrusting Chen Amao to submit declaration forms and being introduced to Su Kunnian by Amao, but denied instigating the use of forged documents and embezzlement. Su Kunnian confessed to conspiring with Customs clerks and declaration clerks from various companies, how Customs clerks stole blank Customs forms to create forged tax forms with reduced tax amounts, how they were submitted by the declaration clerks, and how the clerks seized the opportunity to swap the fake forms for the genuine ones to cover their tracks. Zhang Songtao, Sun Guozhang, Jiang Zhenhan, Tan Miaofa, and Han Jincai were assigned to swap the forms and steal Customs paper. Declaration clerks Chen Zhongshan, Chen Guoliang, Chen Amao, Wang Jianyun, Qian Weiming, Deng Xiaoshan, Xiong Ansheng, He Xianzhong, and Mr. Chen used the forged forms, embezzled tax money, and shared the spoils with Hezhong Company and the Customs clerks. Shi Cunqiao testified that Jiang Zhenhan and Wang Yueren, and also Tan Miaofa, stole Customs paper and assisted the declaration clerks in embezzling and sharing the proceeds. Chen Guoliang claimed that the 400 yuan he received at the Dadong Hotel was a repayment of a loan from his father, Chen Yueting, and not embezzled money. However, Chen Yueting and Chen Guoliang gave conflicting accounts of whether Chen Amao had written an IOU and whether Chen Yueting had personally handed it over, indicating their attempts to conceal the truth. In conclusion, Su Kunnian and Shao Pengfei forged 61 Customs tax forms and seals, violating Articles 225 and 234, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. By providing the forged forms to declaration clerks such as Wang Jianyun, they helped them embezzle in their business operations, violating Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, and Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Chen Amao, Wang Jianyun, Qian Weiming, Deng Xiaoshan, Xiong Ansheng, and He Xianzhong used the forged tax forms to submit payments to the banks entrusted by Customs to collect taxes, thereby using forged official documents, violating Article 233, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and should be punished under Article 225 of the same law. Chen Guoliang instigated Chen Amao to use forged official documents and should be punished under Articles 43 and the aforementioned articles of the same law. Furthermore, they, along with Wang Jianyun, Qian Weiming, Deng Xiaoshan, Xiong Ansheng, and He Xianzhong, embezzled tax money in their business operations, all violating Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Chen Amao, not being in business, helped Chen Guoliang embezzle in his business operations and should be punished under Articles 44, 45, and 356, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Shi Cunqiao, Wang Yueren, Wei Anxiang, Jiang Zhenhan, Zhang Songtao, Sun Guozhang, Chen Zhongshan, Han Jincai, and Tan Miaofa stole Customs paper, violating Article 337, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. By providing this paper to Su Kunnian and Shao Pengfei to forge Customs tax forms and giving them to Wang Jianyun and others for business embezzlement, they provided direct and important assistance and should be punished under Article 44, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code and Articles 225 and 357, Paragraph 1 of the same law. The defendants committed multiple acts of the same crime or committed one crime as a means of committing another and should be punished under Articles 74 and 75 of the Criminal Code, using Article 225 (forging official documents). Except for the declaration clerk Mr. Chen of Deji Foreign Firm, who will be dealt with separately upon apprehension, the prosecution is initiated under Articles 253 and 22 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The prosecution requests a public trial.</p>
<p>The Defense Begins</p>
<p>Lawyers Wu Kaisheng, Fan Gang, Zhang Enhua, Qu Yu, Yao Jiapeng, E Sen, Xi Chuyin, and others rose to defend the defendants, mainly requesting leniency and acquittal. Judge Qian announced the closing of the public prosecution's arguments, and the court would set a date for sentencing. Regarding the Customs'</p>
<p>Private Prosecution</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that the defendants should be pursued for the embezzled Customs money of 91,973.02 taels, equivalent to 186,637.63 yuan in national currency. All defendants, except Chen Guoliang, should be jointly liable for compensation. He also argued that without Hezhong Company as the hub, the defendants could not have committed the embezzlement. He stated that the method of embezzlement was swapping fake forms for genuine forms, and 58 such cases were discovered. Furthermore, Shi Cunqiao, Wei Anxiang, Wang Yueren, and others stole declaration forms, as vividly described. Jiang Zhenhan was the mastermind, and although he had stopped working, he still maintained contact with the others and should bear civil liability. As a result, the court ruled that the civil part would be investigated and handled separately. The defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>and his nephew, Mr. Zhou Bainian</p>
<p>Zhou Xiang, given name Qingyun, also known as Mengpo, from Xunxi, handled salt affairs for 40 years. He organized the Salt Merchants Association of the Five Districts of Suzhou, the Zhejiang Salt Industry Association, and the Zhejiang Salt Affairs School. He was relied upon by officials and merchants alike. He always paid attention to national and people's livelihood, initiated the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and established silk weaving and reeling factories such as Tianzhang, Hulin, Housheng, and Xiumo in Nanxun to improve industry. He spared no effort. He also contributed greatly to public welfare in his hometown, such as founding the Huzhou Commercial Association in Hangzhou and establishing the Huzhou Guild Hall and the Nanxun Guild Hall in Shanghai. He loved mountains and rivers, was skilled in calligraphy and painting, good at poetry, could play the qin, and could identify bronzes and stones. He wrote extensively, and 35 of his works have been published, including the "New History of the West" and the "General History of Salt Law," both running into millions of words and widely circulated. He also helped to supplement the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" at the Wenlan Pavilion in Zhejiang and supported the establishment of the Jiaye Library in Nanxun. These contributions to culture were not insignificant. In addition, he embellished scenic spots, such as building the tower in Lian, the bridge in Tianmu, the pavilion in Chaoshan, repairing the road in Tiantong, supplementing the plum blossoms in Lingfeng, and releasing animals in Xixi. His personality was kind and compassionate. He provided social relief, such as medical care, medicine, rice, and clothing, according to regular schedules for decades, truly being a good person in his hometown. His nephew, Mr. Bainian, given name Jue, was upright and scholarly. In his early years, he founded the South Society, participated in the revolution, and promoted its principles without fear of hardship. During the Northern Expedition, the central government appointed him as Secretary-General to assist in key matters. Later, he became a member of the Control Yuan to rectify discipline and made great contributions. He also strongly supported public welfare in his hometown. Sadly, they both passed away one after another, which is deeply regrettable. The Huzhou small and middle schools in Shanghai, the Zhejiang Huzhou silk industry association, the Huzhou Guild Hall in Shanghai, the Lake Society, the Shibei Middle School, and the Nanxun Guild Hall will hold a memorial service at 2 PM on January 13th in the Grand Auditorium of the Lake Society to express their condolences. Those who wish to send elegiac scrolls may submit them to the Association's office in advance (Lake Society, Guizhou Road).</p>

<p>Defalcated Over 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Principal Reports to Police, Arresting Jiang</p>
<p>Jiang Dafu, a 34-year-old native of Yancheng residing at No. 7, Jingyi Lane, Bailaini Mongolang Road in the French Concession, is involved in the education field. He served as the Head of General Affairs at the private Huiping Middle School, founded by Zhang Pingjiang (female, 31 years old, from Sichuan, residing at No. 13 Dumei Road) at No. 751 Albert Road in the French Concession. Jiang was responsible for all major and minor matters concerning income and expenses at the school. He initially worked diligently and was highly regarded by the principal, teachers, and students. Unexpectedly, Jiang privately embezzled over 2,000 yuan of public funds from the school, causing financial difficulties. The principal discovered this, questioned Jiang, and he gave evasive answers and left the school, avoiding contact. After the school sent people to search for him for several days, they learned that Jiang was hiding at the residence of a friend surnamed Wang at No. 5, Ximen Lane, Ximen Road. The principal, Zhang Pingjiang, reported this to the French police on the previous day, requesting an investigation. The police chief sent detectives to secretly arrest Jiang at the address at 3 PM that day and brought him to the police station. After questioning, the police chief ordered Jiang to be detained on suspicion of embezzlement. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated him in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer Huang Xizhen stated the case, saying that the police arrested the defendant based on the plaintiff's report. Due to time constraints, the investigation was not yet complete, and requested a postponement and temporary detention of the defendant pending a detailed investigation and prosecution. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Principal Zhang Pingjiang, recounted the discovery of the defendant's continuous embezzlement of public funds. After questioning the defendant, the court ordered a postponement for further interrogation on the 12th and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>

<p>Zong Lianzhu, a 19-year-old woman from Nantong, with a fair appearance and some literacy from attending school in her hometown, came to Shanghai with her mother, Zong Zhang, last year. They rented a room at No. 15 Xinle Lane, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, from a second landlord named Cheng Amao (female). Due to the lack of permanent property, the mother and daughter lived hand to mouth, relying on needlework for a living. They struggled with the high cost of living in Shanghai and could not make ends meet, accumulating a debt of 48 yuan in rent, which they were unable to repay. They issued a promissory note for 50 yuan to Cheng Amao, promising to repay it by a certain date. However, Cheng Amao, seeing Lianzhu's youth and beauty and taking advantage of their vulnerable situation, secretly devised a scheme. She falsely told the Zong mother and daughter that they could earn higher wages working in Nanjing than in Shanghai, making it easier to repay the debt and even save money. The Zong mother and daughter, being naive, believed her. Zong Zhang ordered Lianzhu to go to Nanjing with Cheng on June 24th and reside at No. 11, Zhongyi Fang, Taiping Lane. However, after arriving in Nanjing, Cheng did not mention finding work for Lianzhu and instead forced Lianzhu into prostitution. Lianzhu, being in a foreign land with no relatives, was helpless and could only endure in tears, obeying Cheng's orders. The earnings from prostitution were taken by Cheng for her own use. On November 20th, they moved to Rooms 54 and 55 of the Dahua Hotel. Because Lianzhu could no longer endure the suffering, she seized an opportunity to escape from the den late at night and returned to Shanghai. Cheng Amao, upon learning of this, also pursued Lianzhu to Shanghai, intending to take her back to Nanjing and resume her prostitution. Lianzhu's mother, Zhang, upon learning of the situation, was furious and, as her daughter's legal guardian, jointly with her daughter, hired lawyers Zhang Feixiong, Zhang Shibeng, and Wu Zhifen to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Cheng Amao of intent to profit from enticing others into adultery and requesting a legal investigation. They also filed an incidental civil lawsuit. The court has issued summonses and dispatched police to serve them on both parties, scheduling a court hearing on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>

The Tongba bandits invaded and occupied Suixuan, and all Sichuanese were filled with indignation. I, Xiang, was ordered to suppress the bandits, which is my duty. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of our Fifth Route Army were dispatched and fought together against the enemy, successively recovering the lost territories and repeatedly defeating the enemy's advance. The responsibility on the battlefield is not yet fulfilled, and the task of comforting the people is even more pressing. In addition to ordering the various routes to work together to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion as soon as possible, and then to plan for rehabilitation, I also hope to instruct the local authorities to assist in the reconstruction of our homeland. I am exceedingly pleased. Liu Xiang."</p>

Zhang Jiao (played by Chen Hefeng) leaving home and saying goodbye to his wife is particularly wonderful. The entire play is full of loyalty, filial piety, morality, humor, and comedy. The scenery and mechanisms are magnificent, and it can be called one of the great stage plays of the year. It is said that the reserved seats are very crowded.</p>

<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>After purchasing a compilation of your library's catalog last time, I saw the content and methods of your library's "Reading Guidance." I am very pleased because this is indeed a valuable thing at this stage. Five years ago, I was still studying at school, but I didn't feel any interest in reading at all. The books I didn't want to read, the school forced me to read, and vice versa, the books I wanted to read, I didn't have the opportunity to read at school. Although the school didn't prohibit me from reading the books I wanted to read, I had limited time left to prepare for schoolwork. In addition, no one helped me, and I had no opportunity to solve difficulties I encountered while reading. Therefore, the initial ardent desire could not be realized. However, this desire did not subside as a result, but rather made me very depressed because it could not be realized, and entangled in my heart all the time.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have left school and started working in society. Although I have to work eight or nine hours every day, or even ten or eleven hours, and there are no holidays every week, I still have one or two hours of spare time every day, which I can use to do some private things or read books. So I wanted to realize my wish, but the annoyance became more and deeper.</p>
<p>I am a person who likes to study social sciences, and I am most concerned about what the current society will eventually become in the future. However, the theories that explain social phenomena now are diverse, and there are many different kinds, which make me dazzled and unable to decide. For example, "Soviet Studies" was very popular not long ago. There are no less than hundreds of books introducing and studying the Soviet Union, and there are also two or three journals specializing in Soviet studies. It seems that since there are so many research materials, the various cultural relics and systems of the Soviet Union should be clearly presented to us. But in fact, it is the opposite. The more books and newspapers we read, the more confused we become, and the less we can understand the Soviet Union. There are several ways of saying the same thing, and sometimes there are two completely different ways of saying it. Someone or a book says that Soviet agriculture is a big failure, and someone says it is a big success. This is already confusing enough, but there are even more suspicious things. I saw an article in a magazine saying that the Soviet system is a state socialist system, but in another publication, someone regards it as a state capitalist system. If we use the method of canceling factors in mathematics to eliminate the word "state," wouldn't it become two completely different nouns with absolutely opposite meanings—the capitalist system and the socialist system? Sir, how confusing this must be!</p>
<p>The above is just an example I picked up at random. There are many similar things. Therefore, I hope that the most important task of your library's "Reading Guidance" is to point out a proper path for reading and serve as a compass for our reading and research, so as to prevent us from groping blindly in the dark fork in the road, so that we do not go astray and be confused by unreasonable theories, or be trapped in troubles and depression because we cannot figure out what is going on.

<p>To the Editor, I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Gan Zhigang, who claims that his wife, Wang Xiuzhen, and he rented a room on the third floor of the Longfei Shoe Store at No. 431 Zhejiang Road. On the 5th of this month at approximately 5 p.m., foreign police and Chinese police officer Xu A'jin, number 642, broke into the room to arrest prostitutes. However, the Chinese police and foreign police mistook his wife for a prostitute. Despite explanations, the police beat and chased her. His mother-in-law was also insulted and beaten. His wife retreated to the window but was forcefully pushed out the window by the Chinese police officer, causing her to fall headfirst, resulting in a cracked skull, injury, and death. The examination has confirmed this. Mr. Gan is a legitimate businessman. There is no reason for his wife to be a prostitute. Furthermore, when Mr. Gan rented the room, the front of the third floor was empty. He was not aware that prostitutes had moved in later. The Chinese police officer abused his authority and committed homicide. He cannot evade criminal responsibility. However, the news report in the Shen Bao on the 7th of this month, "Investigation into a Case of Death Involving Private Prostitution," does not match the facts. In addition to hiring a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit, I am also asking you to write to the newspaper to correct the facts. Therefore, I am writing on his behalf to request that you investigate and publish this letter in your newspaper's letter to the editor section to clarify the situation. Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely, Lawyer Wang Peiyuan, January 8.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Stuck People <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>On the broad earth, teeming with all living things, with a round head and square feet, complete with five senses and four limbs, able to move, speak, work, eat, sleep, conquer all things, express opinions, commit adultery, plunder, murder, and arson... This is what is called a person. People are the noblest, the most intelligent, the leaders of the masses, the masters of nature. If there were no people, the world would surely be destroyed.</p>
<p>Before one is born into this world, everyone spends ten months in their mother's womb before being born. Even the greatest of heroes cannot escape this maternal womb. No great old man will ever emerge from a crack in a stone, let alone other people.</p>
<p>We simply say "people," but we must understand that there are many different levels among people. Just as there are superior, most superior, and special grades within the upper class, there are of course subtle distinctions between the middle and lower classes. For example, among drivers, there are chauffeur, private car driver, and rickshaw puller. Among waiters, there are those on trains, in large hotels, and in small inns. It is not necessary to go into detail. In summary, we can only divide them into three classes: upper, middle, and lower. Upper-class people, of course, have their airs, their presence, their diet, their housing, and everything else... all in extremely comfortable positions. Lower-class people naturally don't talk about airs or presence. Because they have no airs or presence, their lives are simple and easy to solve.</p>
<p>It is the middle-class people who are the most awkward. They are neither up nor down, stuck in the sieve. They don't have the strength to go up, and they can't fall down from the stage. They need a small presence and social interaction. They can't eat large pancakes for food, and they can't live in gatehouses and broken houses. They can't wear blue cloth shirts and gray skirt. They have to associate with upper-class people, and they need to maintain their appearance. If their clothes are ragged, they are afraid of walking in front of people. They are not as good as rickshaw pullers who can squat on the sidewalk and eat large pancakes and fried dough sticks when they are hungry, or eat a bowl of vegetable porridge from a woman from Jiangbei. They are not as good as those craftsmen who can lean against the counter in a small tavern, drink white liquor, peel peanuts, chew salty radishes, and eat minced sauce meat when they are free. They can be uninhibited and do whatever they want. Can these middle-class people do this? Because they can't, they suffer so much in society. This is what is called "stuck people," which is the result of being a "stuck person"!</p>

<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>— Written for the 30th Anniversary of Minli Middle School —</p>
<p>Minli Middle School has been established for thirty years. From teachers and staff to alumni and students, everyone is enthusiastically commemorating it. Why does it inspire such enthusiastic commemoration? What is its value? I can now answer with a passage written by Mr. Shou Juan in the 30th Anniversary Commemorative Issue of Minli Middle School. He said, "Who doesn't know that Minli Middle School has a history of thirty years? Who doesn't know that Minli Middle School's spirit is the fullest, thirty years as one day, although the years are old, it is still full of vigor? Who doesn't know that Minli Middle School has the most students, the best teachers, the strictest curriculum, and the most appropriate management methods? Who doesn't know that Minli Middle School is the crystallization of the Su brothers' thirty years of hard work, and especially the personal hard work of Principal Su? Therefore, Minli Middle School is like a representative of all middle schools in Shanghai, and it can also be said to be a representative of all middle schools in the country."</p>
<p>I am also an alumnus of Minli. Although I have not made the slightest contribution to this commemoration due to being busy, I dare not forget the kindness of the teachers' teachings. I always keep the words "Minli" in my heart, strive hard, and take on part of the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. At the same time, I hope that all school administrators in China will be as earnest and enthusiastic as Minli.</p>
<p>The former Freedom Talk, now Spring and Autumn, is edited by Mr. Shou Juan. The beauty of the content depends on his skill in selection. He serves the readers very faithfully. It is said that he developed such a good spirit at Minli Middle School. Then Minli Middle School also has indirect contributions to readers.</p>

<p>A person's hope is like an ocean, boundless! Successful people can never fill their desires, but disappointing things become bubbles.</p>
<p>A person's good and evil are most easily exposed when they are angry.</p>
<p>A person must have an object, whether it is a career, a hobby, especially the comfort of the opposite sex - men and women.</p>
<p>A person's appearance is like the exterior of a "watch," some are steel, some are gold-plated. Everyone only pays attention to whether the internal mechanism is excellent. - That is a kind and sincere heart.</p>
<p>A person's body structure is like a wireless radio, and there must be no damage!</p>
<p>A person's greatest achievement is being good at lying.</p>

<p>Whispering Bitter People's Training Weak Breath Before the Lamp</p>
<p>Wandering With a Stick, Watching Heroes With Cold Eyes</p>
<p>Na Gan Jizi was actually in the opposite situation. When he met him on the road that day, he didn't say anything earnest to himself, but left coldly. When he returned home and thought about it, this was not right. Judging from Gui Zhi's face, it was clear that she deeply concealed a difficult secret. Listening to his tone again, it was clear that he was very attached to me. Although he was engaged to someone, he had not yet left the cabinet. If I was willing to marry him and he was willing to marry me, this marriage contract could easily be overturned. The love field is always changing, and there is no fixed standard. If he really regained him into my hands, it is not known. Why should I lose such an opportunity? He had such a change of heart, and he warmed up a gray and cold heart again. The first step is to find out Gui Zhi's tone, what exactly? Unexpectedly, from the second day onwards, I couldn't see Gui Zhi's face. Every time he passed by his door, he deliberately delayed a few steps, but he kept stealing glances at the movements inside the door. The population inside their door was originally simple, and as the weather cooled down, the people inside were hidden in the house, and they couldn't see a single figure. Jizi thought, it must be that Gui Zhi hated me for being too indifferent to him, and he was also discouraged. This is not his fault, but my fault. I must tell him my plan to change my mind tactfully and see what his attitude is. Jizi thought like this. Although he passed by the Yang family's door, he didn't see the people inside. However, the number of times he passed by here every day was even more. At least once every day at noon, and again when the sun was about to set. One day, at about eleven o'clock in the morning, Jizi was wandering around the Yang family again. At the same time, he thought in his heart that he was not the extremely conservative girl who never left the door. Now he suddenly hid deep in the house and refused to show up. There are two reasons for this, either he is sick or he is being restrained. Regarding this matter, I have now broken off contact with the Yang family. How to inquire about the news. (286)</p>

<p>— Painting by Jiang Dongliang, Writing by Chen Fuhua</p>
<p>Heaven and hell are right before our eyes in this world. The disparity between rich and poor creates a deformed society. The problems of food, clothing, and shelter for the poor are the most difficult to solve. Struggling desperately under capitalism, the result is a lingering existence, on the verge of death. They are pressed for food and clothing; how can they have extravagance? It is a piece of luck to have enough to eat and keep warm.</p>
<p>Originally, poker, dice, fine wine, women... these are all the privileges of the rich. They embrace and sing praises, unaware that there are frozen corpses on the roads. They hold slender waists, full of carnal desires, with flattering smiles, singing and dancing merrily. All pleasures are only for the rich to enjoy, the poor are excluded. However, fate plays tricks on people; regardless of rich or poor, everyone has the same eating utensils, and everyone has to defecate.</p>
<p>If one wants poverty and wealth to be equal, and intelligence and foolishness to be treated the same, only air can achieve that.</p>

Throughout his life, he has copied countless stone inscriptions and calligraphy models, numbering over a hundred types. Each time he copies one, he usually does so over five or six hundred times. Approaching seventy, he still tirelessly practices calligraphy, truly a dedicated scholar.

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>This was my first outing after being ill.</p>
<p>At the time when the sun was just rising, I took a streetcar to Dongjiadu Wharf. A lot of people had already gathered at the wharf, along with peddlers... I jumped onto the ferry, and it started moving. Because I didn't want to be suffocated in the cabin, I strolled to the stern of the boat. An old boatman was steering the rudder with a leisurely and calm manner.</p>
<p>"Do you know how deep the water is here?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"About fifteen or sixteen feet deep!"</p>
<p>"If someone fell in here, could they be saved?"</p>
<p>"That's hard to say. If they're lucky, they'll be rescued; if they're unlucky, they're finished!"</p>
<p>"I think people who can swim would be better off!" I used this to refute the fatalistic old man.</p>
<p>"That's for sure," he replied leisurely, unaware that his own words had contradicted each other.</p>
<p>Steam-powered giant ships, wind-powered sailboats, and human-powered small boats were mixed together in the Huangpu River, forming a picture of old and new intertwined.</p>
<p>I was so engrossed in admiring the beautiful scenery on both sides that I didn't feel lonely traveling alone. Finally, the sound of the whistle announced that the ship had arrived at my destination, "Liuli Bridge."</p>
<p>Walking up from the narrow slope, through the small market town, I found B School. I asked the doorman to go in and inform Wu that I had come to see him.</p>
<p>Wu was a friend I had met in H city. He had recently come to B School to work. He wrote to me saying that his teaching life was too mechanical, and he hoped that I could talk to him and see the scenery of Pudong.</p>
<p>I waited in the office. After a while, Wu appeared before my eyes. I saw that he was still as lively and vigorous as before.</p>
<p>"Lou! You've come! It's been a long time since we parted."</p>
<p>"About three years, right? I'm afraid I've changed so much that you won't recognize me!"</p>
<p>"It's been more than three years! But other than the fact that you have a cane in your hand, I don't see any other significant changes."</p>
<p>We both laughed!</p>
<p>Wu invited me inside to talk. We walked through the campus. A bronze statue was erected on the green grass. I asked Wu and learned that it was an educator who had ruined his family to promote education.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about each other's lives after we parted.</p>
<p>"Wu, you said the scenery of Pudong is very good. Shall we go out and take a walk?"</p>
<p>"Okay!" Wu said, leading me out of the school gate.</p>
<p>After passing through a short market town, we reached the countryside. The farmland along the river was fertile, and there were large lakes formed by the confluence of rivers. The water was as clear as a mirror, and the fish could be counted. We walked along the embankment, as if we were on the banks of Xiling Bridge.</p>
<p>"I sometimes bring students here to sketch. The scenery here is very ordinary. I think you'll be disappointed when you see it!" Wu said.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's ordinary? But it already feels very satisfying to me," I replied to Wu. After a while, I added, "It's just that there's a lack of mountain scenery here, but all other aspects are complete."</p>
<p>"Actually, we have already enjoyed the scenery of nature, so why bother to go to that decorated wall! ..." I said.</p>
<p>Because it was getting late and I felt a little hungry, I had a taste of the local flavors with Wu in a small shop in the town, and then hastily said goodbye to Wu.</p>
<p>The return trip was by boat from the South Wharf of Pudong. At three o'clock in the afternoon, I returned to Shanghai, which was filled with smog.</p>

The Bureau has already issued a notice to all schools to comply with this, and it was published in the Education Weekly, Issue 199. However, in recent days, a small number of schools are still using course completion certificates for graduates of primary schools, which is not in compliance.

<h3 id="e160">The University Education Association Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Education to Rescue the Book Industry <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>So that the moribund publishing industry can be revived</p>
<p>And establish state-run bookstores so that booksellers cannot monopolize</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Association submitted the following petition to the Ministry of Education to rescue the depressed book industry and to request the establishment of state-run bookstores. We believe that the strength of a country and the rise and fall of a nation depend on the level of culture to change. If the level of culture is low, nothing can be done, and turmoil will follow. On the contrary, innovation and academic prosperity are possible, and nothing is impossible. Therefore, those who govern the country today devote all their efforts to cultural undertakings in all measures. How can it be said that France's recovery after defeat and Germany's survival despite defeat are not due to the maintenance of culture? Our country has inherited thousands of years of culture, and not only does everyone have characteristics, but also creativity and invention. Tracing the history, almost every generation has had them. However, today, rural areas are bankrupt, industries are declining,</p>
<p>Education is not universal Morality is declining day by day. Why is this? In a word, it is due to the decline of culture. To know the actual situation of a country's culture, one should experience it in many ways, and the book industry is the barometer of cultural undertakings. Therefore, there are many reasons for the decline of culture in our country, but the depression of the book industry nationwide is also a major reason. In the past, the book industry in our country seemed to be still sound, but the national crisis of the past year has suddenly caused social and economic devastation, directly and indirectly affecting the national economy and people's livelihood. Since clothing and food are not enough to support oneself, how can there be spare energy to seek knowledge? As for ordinary booksellers, they all tighten up their businesses due to the exhaustion of the social economy and the low purchasing power of the people,</p>
<p>Forming a situation of outward strength but inward weakness Even if there are a small number of more financially capable operators who can maintain their businesses, they take advantage of the opportunity to hoard and profit, making it impossible for the people who are eager to learn but unable to buy to stop and sigh at the sight of books. At the same time, ordinary booksellers often only see profit, and they are unwilling to spend heavily to buy works, which affects the research and publication of works by ordinary scholars. This kind of fact of reciprocal restriction has a law of mutual causation. If so, how can we expect the revival of culture and the prosperity of scholarship? Now, the entire book industry has already shown a bias and deformity in the midst of decline and decay. As the sun sets and the road is long, it is directly</p>
<p>Affecting the nation The decline of culture and the failure to popularize national education only lead to national unrest and rampant human desires. If this continues without finding a way to rescue it, the future of culture will become increasingly dim, and the national economy and people's livelihood will suffer. Thinking of this, I am very worried. Moreover, in this time when the constitutional government has not been established and the national crisis is still severe, the people's political ability urgently needs to be cultivated. Without reviving culture, promoting scholarship, and popularizing education, there is no way to put politics on the right track. However, all these points depend on the development of the publishing industry and the expansion of bookstore operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can only ask the Ministry to Allocate funds to expand bookstore operations so that the moribund publishing industry can be revived, and to plan to establish state-run bookstores so that deformed booksellers cannot monopolize them. Other measures, such as rewarding writing to promote academic research and reducing book prices to satisfy the people's purchasing power, are the goals of our association, which is determined to save the country and dedicated to scholarship. We deeply believe that the impact of cultural undertakings on the national fortune is extremely important, and the impact of bookstore operations on culture is even greater. We see the shortcomings of the times and worry like we are pulling out our hearts. We dare to sincerely plead for the moribund book industry and ask for a quick response, then the cultural future will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Ministry of Education Sends Lei Zhen on a Secret Investigation Regarding the Great Disturbance at Jinan University <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Two Representatives of Overseas Chinese Students Go to the Capital to State the Truth</p>
<p>The Scheduled Examinations Yesterday Did Not Take Place</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Education has repeatedly received telegrams from President Zheng of Jinan University, detailing the course of the disturbance and his painstaking efforts to maintain the school. He also suggested an early vacation to quell the student unrest imperceptibly. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education, in addition to telegraphing the Shanghai Municipal Government to dispatch police to strictly maintain order at the school, replied to Zheng, ordering him to urge faculty and students to hold semester examinations early and then begin the vacation. On the 8th, it was reported that Zheng had complied with the order and published a notice stating that examinations would begin at the school on the 8th. In order to understand the truth of the Jinan University disturbance, the Ministry of Education sent Chief of General Affairs Lei Zhen to Shanghai on the evening of the 6th for a secret and thorough investigation. Lei is expected to return to the capital within two or three days. The Ministry of Education will determine its course of action after receiving Lei's thorough investigation report. As for the report that the Ministry of Education sent Director of Higher Education Shen Pengfei to Shanghai to investigate the Jinan University disturbance, Shen told reporters on the 8th that his trip to Shanghai was for personal matters, and the report was not factual. The Ministry of Education has now sent Director Lei to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Jinan University disturbance.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th. Overseas Chinese students from Jinan University have sent two representatives, Lin Yanxi and Wu Yiping, to the capital to state the truth of the student unrest to the central government. Lin and Wu said that overseas Chinese students account for eighty or ninety percent of their school's population. They have taken a wait-and-see attitude towards this student unrest. However, they now feel that the environment is so unfavorable that they can no longer remain silent. Therefore, they sent them to the capital to state the truth, hoping that the student unrest can be resolved as soon as possible. As for the main cause of this student unrest, it is merely due to the incitement of a few people from outside. As representatives of overseas Chinese students, their position is pure. They have already presented their impartial opinions to the government and have been well-received. They are scheduled to visit President Wang and Minister Wang on the 9th and will return to Shanghai that evening.</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The student expulsion disturbance at the National Jinan University has lasted for more than ten days without resolution. Representatives from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission came to Shanghai and visited the school yesterday to investigate. The students ended the examinations, which did not take place. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>OCAC Representatives Arrive at School for Investigation. Chen Chun, Director of the Education Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the Jinan University disturbance. In addition to inquiring about everything from all relevant parties, Chen made a special trip to the school yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM to conduct an on-site investigation. He was received by Chen Guanghe, Fan Xifan, and Tan Shiwei, representatives of the expulsion committee. The representatives reported to Chen about the course of the disturbance and the students' determination to expel Zheng, and hoped that Chen would uphold justice and provide strong assistance to all the students of Jinan University. Chen replied that Jinan University is the highest institution of higher learning for overseas Chinese education, and he hoped that the disturbance would be resolved as soon as possible to restore the students' studies. The points raised will be reported to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and then forwarded to the central government. Afterwards, he visited various parts of the school for a week and saw that the order was good and the students were all studying in the library and study room, which he greatly praised.</p>
<p>The Scheduled Examinations Did Not Take Place Yesterday. For days, newspapers have been publishing notices stating that "Jinan University will resume examinations on the 8th." Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency drove to the school to inquire about the truth. He saw that there was not a single person in the classrooms, and dozens of patrolmen were patrolling in between (maintaining order). According to student representative Tan Shiwei, the notices of Jinan's resumption of classes published in newspapers recently were issued by Zheng Hongnian, who had already been expelled, and the students not only ignored this notice.</p>
<p>Shanghai Alumni Call Emergency General Meeting. More than seventy alumni of the school in Shanghai, including Ping Zuren, Qiu Hanping, Zhuang Shihong, Ye Dehan, Lan Wenhai, Fan Kangyuan, Yu Rui, and Cai Guoping, have launched a call for an emergency general meeting of all alumni to be held at 66 Hankou Road on the afternoon of the 11th of this month (Thursday) at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Organize Petition Teams to Visit School Trustees in Rotation. Members of the school's Expel Zheng Committee went to the port yesterday morning to welcome Trustee Sun, but due to the late hour, they did not meet him. The committee also believes that since the outbreak of the Expel Zheng disturbance, the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have sent people to investigate, but the Board of Trustees has not yet expressed its opinion. Therefore, in order to quickly resolve the disturbance, it has organized several petition teams to visit the offices of the trustees in rotation every day, waiting for a response.</p>
<p>Statement by the Shanghai Jinan University Alumni Association. The Shanghai Jinan University Alumni Association sent a letter stating, (1) The executive committee of the association held a meeting at the China Press on the afternoon of the 7th at 2:00 PM and discussed until 6:00 PM, hosting representatives of the Capital Jinan University Alumni Association and jointly discussing and trying to find a positive solution. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. As for the issue of the president, the central government and the Board of Trustees have the right to weigh the matter, and no one else has the right to interfere. Yesterday's report that "the president's resignation is not an issue" is not in accordance with the facts. The association and the Beijing association have always been determined that everything can be discussed without discussing the issue of the president. Since it is not within the scope of discussion, how can it be considered a representation of the association? All members of the association know the law and understand the principles, and are deeply concerned that readers may be deceived by them. This statement is made specifically to clarify. (2) The association was established in the autumn of 1927 and is re-elected every autumn. Furthermore, in accordance with the instructions of the party and government authorities, all gatherings and movements are prohibited during this unstable period. If anyone uses the name of the association to organize illegal groups and disrupt the alma mater, the association will not only not recognize them, but will also do its best to deal with them.</p>
<h3 id="e162">This City's Education Expenses in Arrears, City Principals Stage Large-Scale Petition Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Arrears Up to March, Principals Unable to Maintain Schools</p>
<p>Rural Schools to Continue Petitioning in Two Batches</p>
<p>(Shanghai Times) This city's education funding has always been considered abundant, and education salaries are also better than in the interior. Although the "January 28th" incident caused a sudden shortage of funds in the city, education expenses were still paid monthly, and there were never any arrears. In recent months, due to the impact of the current situation, the city's finances have experienced unprecedented difficulties. As of this month, the education expenses of all municipal schools have been in arrears for as much as three months, so that the regular expenses of each school, such as rent, tap water, electricity, coal, labor, and miscellaneous expenses, cannot be met. Teachers' salaries also cannot be advanced in the slightest, so that the principals of each school are sitting in a city of worry and unable to cope. They had no choice but to gather yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to petition the Education Bureau for the release of funds in order to maintain education. The details of the petition are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Situation. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, more than seventy people, including Cheng Kuanzheng, Principal of Wusong Middle School; Sheng Zhensheng, Principal of Xinlu Normal School; Tao Guangchuan, Principal of Jingye Middle School; Jing Zhenyu, Principal of Wuben Girls' School; Gu Yinqian, Principal of Wanzhu Primary School; Zhao Lüqing, Principal of Xicheng Primary School; Qian Xuanqing, Principal of Zhengzheng Primary School; and Yang Jingyi, Principal of Shangwen Primary School, took more than ten cars and drove directly to the Education Bureau in the city center to personally present the difficulties of each school to Director Pan. After leaving, they went to the Municipal Government to petition Mayor Wu. Director Pan and Mayor Wu received them separately.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Response. Mayor Wu and Director Pan expressed great sympathy for the difficulties of each school. However, due to the impact of the city's economic downturn on the city's finances, the income has been reduced, and new receipts are particularly weak, resulting in inflexible turnover. All expenses have to be temporarily postponed. However, the Municipal Government is well aware of the difficult situation in the education sector. In any case, it will decide to release one month's expenses as soon as possible to maintain operations. The remaining months' expenses will be cleared before the Lunar New Year. The principals of each school were satisfied and returned to their schools one after another.</p>
<p>Rural Schools Continue to Petition. The Shanghai Times reporter learned from another source that the principals of the schools who set off to petition this time were limited to the prosperous areas of the city. In addition, there are also the principals of the rural schools in the urban area who are also preparing to set off in full force to launch a second batch of petitions.</p>
<p>(Fuxing News Agency) The principals of the municipal schools in the two districts of Shanghai South and Zhabei stated that the first semester of the 22nd year is about to end, but the expenses of the municipal schools have not yet been issued by this date. The temporary and added-level expenses for last November were still budgeted and claimed as usual, but there was no outcome. Yesterday morning, the principals of each school took advantage of the convenience of receiving payments to visit Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau to personally present the difficulties of each school and request a solution. The director explained in detail the difficulties of education and the painstaking efforts to maintain it over the past few months, and expressed that he would do his best to find a solution before the winter vacation to ensure that the funds to be issued to the municipal schools would be adequately addressed. The principals of each school were extremely satisfied, and then they went to the new Municipal Government. Since Mayor Wu was out on official business, Secretary-General Yu received them. The principals then pushed Zhao Lüqing to make a brief statement. Mr. Yu expressed deep sympathy for the principals' representations and said that the education expenses of Guangdong Province account for 30% of the city's revenue. He personally hoped that this city's education expenses could also have this proportion. However, the current difficulties will be addressed by convening representatives from the Education and Finance Bureaus within the next few days to try their best to plan and ensure that they can overcome this difficult situation and then seek the development of future education undertakings. Afterwards, he led them to visit the various facilities of the Municipal Government, and the principals happily said goodbye and left.</p>

<p>Also Wins Over Chizhi</p>
<p>- Two Group A Matches Tonight -</p>
<p>Only two Group A matches were played in the Western Youth YMCA basketball league last night. Because it was Monday, the audience was sparse. As a result, Yese won over Chizhi by a score of 58-23, dominating throughout. Another match between old rivals, Jiangwan and Xiaguang, was tense, with the lead changing hands repeatedly. In the end, Jiangwan won by a score of 51-40. Tonight, the four Chinese teams will compete in Group A. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Yese Wins Over Chizhi Although both sides were enthusiastic at the beginning, they only tasted the sweetness of free throws. Yese's Zhang Wenyuan scored first, and Chizhi's Qian Dingshen retaliated. After fighting for five minutes, each side scored one point. Later, Yese rose up, and Zheng Zhifang, Tao Shaosheng, and others launched a series of attacks, taking a comfortable lead of 33-16 in the first half. In the second half, Qian Dingshen's shooting was outstanding, making people look at him differently. However, in terms of the overall game, it was still ineffective. As a result, Yese won 58-23 to the delight of the team.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Wins Over Xiaguang Qiu Guangxie immediately scored two free throws after coming on the court, and Jiangwan was slightly smooth. Soon, it was tied at 5 each, and Xiaguang's Lin Qiren scored two goals to surpass them. Then it was 11-13, and it was tied again and again. Zhao Butian took things out of his pocket, and Jiangwan finally won the first half 24-19. In the second half, Guan Dang'an scored two goals in an instant, and Lin Qiren scored, reversing the score by one point. During this period, Jiangwan's Zhao Butian, Zhou Dayun, and others suddenly rose up like a storm, widening the gap to 49-19. Although Xiaguang was resurrected from the ashes, it was too late. Jiangwan triumphed 51-40.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Palace Punishment and Others <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Ke Weiqi, while compiling a new edition of the "History of Song," castrated himself to concentrate his thoughts. However, some say he wanted to emulate Sima Qian, so not only did he strive for resemblance in his writing, but he also sought to recreate similar circumstances. Whether Ke Weiqi resembled Sima Qian, I am not entirely sure. But a writer's circumstances are not to be ignored. The "Records of the Grand Historian" was indeed influenced by Sima Qian having undergone palace punishment. However, this does not mean that good writing comes from lacking reproductive organs. Rather, the issue lies in one's usual self-regard, which, when suddenly subjected to palace punishment, causes pent-up grievances to erupt into writing, inevitably with some vehemence. But if one were to castrate oneself, one's genitals might indeed fall off, and one's voice might indeed become shrill. To say that this would enable one to write the "Records of the Grand Historian" is not necessarily true. Not only is self-castration like this, but even being castrated does not guarantee results. Through the ages, there have been eunuchs, but not all of them produced "Records of the Grand Historian." Even if there were such works, they were not from the hands of eunuchs.</p>
<p>The idea that undergoing palace punishment can lead to good writing has already failed in Chinese experiments. Now, Mr. Hitler has suddenly taken an interest and wants to use palace punishment to govern the country. It is said that all those suffering from madness, syphilis, neurasthenia, and those who commit criminal acts must have their reproductive function eliminated—in other words, undergo palace punishment. This law has been in effect since this year. For example, a Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 6th states:</p>
<p>The new law eliminating reproductive function has been in effect since January 1st of this year, and the authorities are now actively enforcing it. Today, the court in Görlitz, Silesia, Prussia, sentenced a 54-year-old worker accused of committing sodomy against a child to one year in prison and palace punishment.</p>
<p>Such a grand event is truly worthy of celebration. With just a light cut, everything is taken care of. Not only will the person never commit the crime again in their lifetime, but even their descendants will be definitively dealt with. The loneliness and resentment of the unmarried, the poverty and hardship of the people, and all the subsequent temptations and coercions have nothing to do with Mr. Hitler's virtuous governance. Syphilis, madness, neurasthenia, and even criminal behavior are all innate heredity and should be blamed on one's parents. Therefore, once the criminal is castrated, the world is at peace. How great is Mr. Hitler!</p>
<p>It seems that China was promoting solutions to the sexual desires of prisoners last year. In the eyes of people like Hitler, this is somewhat dangerous, as it might lead to the birth of a batch of robbers and thieves. But the Chinese are not worried. The reason is simple. Good writing causes headaches. As long as good writing is not produced, palace punishment is unnecessary. As for the birth of a batch of robbers and thieves, that is a matter for future generations.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Preface to "A Comprehensive Dictionary of Phrases" <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>I have always been fond of scholarly tools, and today, what the academic world needs most is scholarly tools. The so-called "well-versed" person in ancient times was only well-versed in the study of classics, history, righteousness, and literary composition. All six classics are history, as Bao Xiuding [likely a typo, should be Zhang Xuecheng] has long said. But are the six classics not all literature? Are studies of classics and historical theories not all studies of righteousness? Generally speaking, it is the study of Confucian scholars. Occasionally, there might be specialized fields, such as Gu Tinglin's expertise in geography, Dai Dongyuan's expertise in mathematics, Duan Yucai's expertise in philology, Qian Daxin's expertise in the history of the Yuan Dynasty, and Gong Zizhen's expertise in Mongolian script, but all were regarded as appendages to classics and history. In ancient times, learning was extremely complex, but all was integrated into one's heart, with the stomach as a repository. If there were any doubts that could not be retrieved from within, or if there were allusions whose source in a particular chapter of the "Book of Rites" or a particular biography in the "Records of the Grand Historian" could not be immediately pointed out, one would not be considered a well-versed person. At that time, the fashion was to value profundity and obscure diction, regarding shallowness and simplicity as vulgar, and to prefer esoteric language, considering easy retrieval as commonplace. Therefore, even though there were scholarly tools, they were not valued by well-versed people. However, from the perspective of modern people, this is truly meaningless. The spirit of ancient scholars is commendable, but the time they spent was truly excessive. If China's academia did not have systematic works such as the "Comprehensive History," the "Comprehensive Examination of Documents," and the "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings" and the "Collected Explanations of Classical Texts" to rely on, the wasted time would be even greater. Moreover, today's scholarship is different from the past. It is impossible to use the stomach as a repository. Henry Ford said, "A well-versed person is someone who knows which book to consult when encountering a difficult problem." Whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, scholarly tools can all indicate the path to learning, save time, and also inspire by analogy, leading people into the subject. Their benefit to the scholarly community is truly not small and should not be disregarded simply because compilation is inferior to authorship. The publication of the "Ci Yuan" [The Sea of Words, a Chinese dictionary] was seen as a blessing by the academic community. Although there was both praise and criticism, its contribution to saving us scholarly time cannot be denied. The more such scholarly tools there are, the better, but unfortunately, modern people are lazy and cannot see them often enough. I was delighted when I heard that the Kaiming Bookstore was compiling an index to the Thirteen Classics, and now I am even more delighted to read Mr. Zhu Danjiu's "A Comprehensive Dictionary of Phrases" published by Kaiming. This book frees Chinese teachers from being embarrassed by students, as was the case with Mr. Zhu in the past. Its detailed and extensive citations and precise research far surpass the "Ci Yuan" and are comparable to the "Collected Explanations of Classical Texts." The difference is that the "Collected Explanations" focuses on single characters, while "A Comprehensive Dictionary of Phrases" focuses on phrases. The "Collected Explanations" was completed by many hands, while "A Comprehensive Dictionary of Phrases" is the achievement of Mr. Zhu's lifelong efforts alone. His spirit of authorship is no less than that of Zhu Junsheng [compiler of Shuowen Jiezi Du, Annotations of Shuowen Jiezi]. The so-called "well-versed" means being well-versed in variant forms. Ancient people often used characters as phonetic loans, and phonetic loans are variant characters. Due to different writing styles in ancient and modern times or different local customs, a single character often has variant forms. For example, 吉祥 (jíxiáng, auspicious) is written as 㐂祥, or 吉圭. 有覺德行 (yǒu jué déxíng, to have conscious virtue) is also written as 有楷. 勉勉文王 (miǎnmiǎn wénwáng, diligently King Wen) is also written as 勉勉. Even personal and place names do not have a fixed form. 西施 (Xī Shī, a famous beauty) is also written as 先施. 計兒 (Jì Ér, a proper name) is also written as 計然, 計倪, 計㲢, 計硯. 汶山 (Wèn Shān, Mount Wen) is 忞山, 岷山, 悶山, 蒙山. In the same "Records of the Grand Historian," 疱犧 (Páo Xī, a mythical emperor) is also written as 宓戲 (Mì Xì). In the same "Book of Han," 包犧 (Bāo Xī, same as above) is also written as 炮犧, 伏犧, 虙戲, 宓犧, 虙犧, 宓戲. Other examples include 褻衣 (xiè yī, underwear) also written as 設衣, 子規 (zǐ guī, cuckoo) also written as 子巂, 子鳺, 子雉, 子矐, 子嵨, 鴸鳺, 鷤鴶, 鸓鳺. The confusion is extensive, with no comprehensive record. Thus, scholars suffer. Without a book to explain these variants, even scholars well-versed in the classics will inevitably encounter obstacles. Thus, Mr. Zhu's embarrassment is understandable. Since the Qing Dynasty, philology has flourished, and the study of variants has been emphasized by scholars. However, it can be limited to one school of thought, such as Li Fusun's "Interpretations of Variant Forms in the Book of Poetry," "Interpretations of Variant Forms in the Book of Changes, Zuo Zhuan, and Gongyang Zhuan," Zhao Tan's "Annotations of Variant Forms in the Spring and Autumn Annals," Feng Dengfu's "Commentaries on Variant Forms in the Three Schools of Poetry," and Chen Qiaosong's "Examination of Variant Forms in the Four Schools of Poetry," all of which are examples. As for those who comprehensively collect the general loan words in classical works, such as Fang Yizhi's "Tong Ya" (釋詁, Explanation of Words) in the Ming Dynasty, Wu Yujin's "Bie Ya" (别雅, Another Explanation of Words), Qian Dian's "Ten Classics Characters General Correct Book" (十經文字通正書), and Ruan Yuan et al.'s "Collected Explanations of Classical Texts" (經籍纂詁) (each word entry) in the Qing Dynasty. Other scattered materials can be found in almost all books on philology, such as Wang Shu's "Annotations to Guang Ya," Hao Shu's "Annotations to Er Ya," "Explanations of Classical Meanings," and "Ten Carriage Study and New Record," etc. However, none is as comprehensive as Mr. Zhu's book. Although the book is limited to phrases with two reiterated characters, it has already incorporated most of the single-character loanwords. For example, the ancient meaning of 夷遲 can be seen in the entries for 馮夷, 凌夷, and 倭遲. 夷 is also interchangeable with 雉 and 薙, as can be seen in the entry for 辛夷. The details of the citations are extensive, such as the "Ling Yi" entry citing 26 examples, the "Ling Chi" entry citing 56 examples, and "Ling Chi" 3, "Ling Chi" 1, "Ling Chi" 3 (Volume 2, pages 25 to 27); and another entry for "Ling Yi" citing 6 examples, "Ling Chi" citing 2 examples, and "Qi Chi" citing 1 example; and an added entry for "Ling Yi" 1, "Ling Chi" 1; 逶迤 is written as 威夷, 逶夷, 蜲㫤, 委蛇, 逶虵, 褘㫤, 逶隨, 委佗, 委它, 䅏胰, 逶移, 猗移, 委維, 延維, 逶陀, 逶蛇, 委遲, 遺蛇, 逶迱, 委移, 委陀, 逶迂, 碏迆 (Volume 2, pages 104 to 107), 倭遲, 威遲, 倭夷, 威紆, 郁夷 (Volume 2, page 36) totaling 74 entries, which can be said to be a magnificent spectacle. All the materials collected are the basic materials for Chinese philology. In the past, when the British compiled the Oxford English Dictionary, they first collected 2 million entries, and then they had a clear understanding of the usage, form, and evolution of each English word in history. Mr. Zhu achieved so much with one person's energy, which is amazing. Based on this book, one can conduct research on the form of standard script, and one can also conduct research on the evolution of sound, but one must be able to distinguish the system of the times and places. For example, the "Ling 㫤" entry, which is seen in inscriptions, can be studied. The character "Chi" is seen in the Han Han Chi stele, Zhang Qian stele, and Tang Longxin Daochang inscription. Under the "Wei Yi" entry, "Wei 给" is seen in the Jin Tao Qian 㫤 Shang Hua Zan, "褘㫤" is seen in the Han Wei Wei Wei stele, "㫤 隨" is seen in the Han Cheng 㫤 Ling Tang Xia Song stele, and "Wei Wei" and "Yan Wei" are seen in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. The sound changes, such as Yi Chi (古 j 音近 d, ancient j sound is close to d) can be exemplified by Feng Yi - Feng Chi, Wei Yi - Wei Chi, Ling Yi - Ling Chi, Xin Yi - Xin Zhi - Xin 碏, etc. Whether it is alliteration (changing the rhyme without changing the initial consonant) or rhyme (changing the initial consonant without changing the rhyme), one can seek the principles of convergence and the conditions of origin and time in the book. Therefore, this book is truly a treasure trove of Chinese philology today. It is hoped that those who are good at learning will make use of it in many ways.</p>
<h3 id="e180">"What to Do?" <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wu Sihong</p>
<p>Yesterday, braving the wind, I went to North Sichuan Road to visit the end-of-semester exhibition of a certain school. I paid special attention to the art as if I had studied art myself. Indeed, the works were quite good. Although there were few paintings, they created a lively atmosphere in the small room. There were quite a few visitors, and I seemed to have met some of them before. I even nodded to a male guest wearing a black coat.</p>
<p>After being busy with illness for a year, I entered a healthy crowd for the first time, and the art environment seemed to create a new wave in my heart. But I felt that my heart was still in the ice and snow. As I carefully savored a certain painting, a acquaintance suddenly walked in. He was the instructor of the art department of that school. He shook hands with me and introduced me to his friends. He said, "This is MISS X. Although her face is cold, I believe her heart must be very passionate..." After hearing these words, I suddenly doubted myself. I looked down at my chest, wanting to see if my heart was cold or hot. But there was a piece of cloth in front of my chest, part of the whole garment. I suddenly felt ridiculous and smiled. My smile made the ground where I stood cold. Afterwards, I looked around, and it was empty. There was no one. I looked at the corner of the house, and everyone was there. They were concentrating on a painting above their heads. I also walked over. The art instructor was gesturing and explaining the artistic meaning of his talented student's creation:</p>
<p>"This mother, um...this poor mother, holding her newborn child, is wondering whether to raise him or abandon him. She is hesitating and cannot decide, so the theme is 'What to Do?'"</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence, the visitors' gazes all left the painting and shot at my face.</p>
<p>How strange! Why were they looking at me like that? Was I like the painting? Or did they want me to answer the question of "What to Do?" If I were like the painting, then at least I would have to be holding a child to look like it, but I was standing alone, and I didn't have a child in my arms. The expression was also very different. Wasn't my face cold, as the art instructor said? Cold means without any movement, like a block of ice. That is to say, I just smiled. So what remained after the smile was still a smile, and not hesitation!</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought that they were probably testing me, and it would be impolite not to answer the question. In fact, it was already impolite at that time, because I didn't say anything. It was just a cold face, maybe with a remnant of a smile? Then it could be made up for. So I tried to write an essay!</p>
<p>"What to Do?" What to do? Having a child means that the child, like an adult, needs to eat, wear clothes, and live in a house, and needs adults to take care of him. I think the mother in that painting must have had money before, or was once a "Miss". She doesn't have a penny now, and it is difficult to solve her own personal life, where will she get the money to support her son? That is to say, she got a chance in all difficulties and found a job, at least she can make a living, then she can't hug the child to work, if she throws away her son, the son is always born by herself, born from her own belly, is the crystallization of her love with that man, she must be reluctant to bear the child, she must regard the child as a treasure, maybe as life, so the theme of "What to Do?" is very appropriate. If the mother in that painting has always been a poor woman, who has pounded rice, dug the ground, or woven cloth, or made straw sandals, then she doesn't need to hesitate, even if she hesitates, she will definitely solve it herself easily, although the same child also needs to eat, wear clothes, and live in a house. But she will give her own milk, give him the rice she saved, hug him in her arms and sleep in a cotton quilt as hard as iron, and during the day she does her work, puts the child on a mat or in a bamboo basket, the child eats a little, sleeps a little, cries all day when he is uncomfortable, the mother hugs him hurriedly when she has time, and forgets it when she doesn't have time, scolding him loudly when she is psychologically anxious, raising the child like this, it is good if he dies, and it is even better if he lives. If she doesn't want to raise him at all, she will put him in a tattered bundle when he is born and send him to the orphanage. Under such motherhood, I don't need to solve her problem, and there is no so-called problem in her head at all.</p>
<p>Mother in the painting! You don't need to hesitate anymore, bravely do what you want!</p>

<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>The two women moved their chairs slightly as they sat down. "Didn't you go out today?" Mrs. Roland asked.</p>
<p>"No. To be honest, I'm a little tired." So she recounted all the joy she had received on this little trip and the shrimp-catching game, as if thanking Jean and his mother.</p>
<p>"Do you know," she said, "I ate the shrimp I caught myself this morning. It was so delicious. If you'd like, we can go shrimp-catching again someday..."</p>
<p>The young man interrupted her:</p>
<p>"Before starting another round, let's finish the first one, shall we?" "What do you mean? I think the first round ended a long time ago."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mrs. Lhuire, as far as I'm concerned, I'm at the west of the rock in Saint-Jean."</p>
<p>She pretended to be innocent and cunning;</p>
<p>"You? What is it? What did you find?"</p>
<p>"A wife! And my mother and I came especially to ask her if she had one this morning."</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<p>"No, I never change my mind."</p>
<p>So he stretched out his hand, palm wide open, to her, and she pressed against it with a warm</p>
<p>He asked:</p>
<p>"The sooner, the better, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Whenever you want is fine with me."</p>
<p>"Is six weeks okay?"</p>
<p>"I have no opinion. What does my future mother-in-law think?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland replied with a slightly melancholy smile:</p>
<p>"Ah! As for me, I have no say. I only thank you for choosing Jean, because you will make him very happy."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best, Mother."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lhuire seemed a little touched for the first time, stood up, stretched out her arms and hugged Mrs. Roland, kissing her for a long time like a child; under this new caress, a strong emotion swelled the poor woman's wounded heart. She couldn't express her feelings at this time. It was both tragic and sweet at the same time. She had lost a son, a big son, and now someone was giving her a daughter, a big daughter, to fill the void.</p>
<p>As the two were still sitting face to face on their chairs, they held each other's hands, motionless, looking at each other, smiling at each other, and Jean was almost forgotten by them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they talked a lot about the things that needed to be considered for the wedding that was about to be held, and when everything was decided and discussed, Mrs. Lhuire seemed to suddenly remember a minor matter and asked them:</p>

<p>Raised by One to Two Yuan and Six Jiao</p>
<p>Busy Trading, Only One Session in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a major surge, and the market atmosphere was very tense. Short covering and new long positions emerged in full force, and short sellers were extremely panicked. This was due to repeated reports of victories by the Central Army, forcing short sellers to cut their losses. In the morning's first session, "Bianqian" (Reorganization) surged by 2 yuan, "Caibing" (Troop Reduction) rose by 2 yuan and 3 jiao, and the rest also rose by 1 and a half yuan. The demand from various groups was very strong, and the volume was huge. Although there were large numbers of sales of the 11th, 21st, and 23rd issues, it was merely a drop in the bucket. Trading was also extremely busy, with about 13 to 14 million in one session. In the second session, only "Bianqian" slightly eased by one or two jiao, while other varieties continued to rise by one or two jiao to over one yuan due to short covering by various groups. In the afternoon, due to busy trading and the need for consolidation, the session was delayed until 5:30 PM, so only one session was held. Market prices showed a slight retreat of one or two jiao to four or five jiao. Among them, only 19 "Shan," 20 "Juan," and 20 "Guan" were still up by one or two jiao. The overall result for the day was a uniform increase of around 1 yuan to 2 yuan and 6 jiao. With too many exposed short positions, there is still a tendency for continuous increases. The total transaction volume is estimated to be around 35 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e189">US Automobile Stocks and Others Show Slight Weakness <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>A report from 新豐洋行 (Xinfeng Foreign Firm) on the 6th stated that the New York stock market was unusually sluggish. Several stocks, such as automobile stocks, showed slight weakness. This was because the annual automobile exhibition was scheduled to open today, and bulls were still taking profits as usual. However, business news was good, including Pan American shares paying a dividend of 12.5 cents, the first time since July 1931. US bonds fluctuated very little, and commodities were slightly firm. Wall Street believes that the government's bond program has inflationary implications and expects prices to rise, unemployment to decrease, and business to improve in the next quarter, and the stock market may also tend to rise. The half-day trading volume was only 461,920 shares. "Wheat" trading was very quiet. Although there was no pressure, it was still weak. Regarding "Cotton," according to news from Washington, the government will adopt a compromise plan to resist the inflation faction in Congress. Generally, it may adopt a fixed US dollar policy. The cotton market was stable and slightly firm. Many bulls taking profits were absorbed by factories. The Financial Rehabilitation Agency purchased gold at a price of 34.06 yuan per tael, unchanged.

<p>--Spot Sales Also Show Signs of Revival--</p>
<p>The yarn market is gradually showing signs of a turnaround. Due to rising raw cotton prices and rumors of peace, along with a surge in securities, sentiment is positive. At the same time, spot sales also show signs of improvement. Long-stagnant customer orders have suddenly become active, so market prices have risen slightly. However, sellers' short positions have not yet been covered. If spring sales continue, the yarn market should have the power to recover.</p>
<p>Manbiao (cotton) Continues to Improve Yuanxu (cotton) In the morning, the market opened flat. After two or three rounds of bidding, cotton prices rose, and buying interest increased again. Prices for all months rose by one yuan to one yuan and nine jiao. In the afternoon, there was a slight drop of two, four, or five jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 25,200 bales. Sales included 1,600 bales from Ruida, 800 bales from Yuanda, 1,000 bales from Shenji, 1,300 bales from Dachang, 1,000 bales from Yiyu, and 400 bales from Yuda. Purchases included 900 bales from Delong, 1,150 bales from Dachangcheng, 1,100 bales from Changfeng, 500 bales from Xiesheng, 1,000 bales from Xincheng, and 500 bales from Senkang.

<p>Hankou 70 Shantou 30 Yunnan 130 Fellow Traders 90</p>
<p>The Cotton Market's Rising Trend Intensifies The rising trend of the cotton market is intensifying. As Indian cotton continues to rise and the American cotton market also sees increases, sentiment has become firmer and buying interest is strong. Furthermore, there are rumors in the market that prices in various producing areas are rising, and there is positive news about the situation, leading to a surge in short covering by retail investors. The future situation still depends on fluctuations in the foreign cotton market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's (cotton) Rising Momentum Strengthens The Zheng Biao market opened with a uniform increase in foreign cotton prices. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and prices for all months rose by four, five, six, or seven jiao.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, near-month prices fell by five fen to one jiao, while far-month prices rose by five fen to one jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 155,500 dan.

<p>At the beginning of the week, due to disappointment with the Indo-Japanese conference, there were considerable sales and profit-taking by bulls. Afterwards, with the resolution of the Indo-Japanese conference, short sellers covered their positions, and new buyers also made purchases, causing market prices to rise. However, there was some profit-taking at high prices. In terms of spot goods, Japanese shippers were quite active, and there were also purchases from Europe. Local factories' purchases were more intense than before. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>Wheat Seems to Be in Surplus</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for various months showed an initial rise followed by stability. With foreign wheat prices rising by one jiao, sentiment was very firm at the beginning, better than the previous week's closing price by half a fen or one fen. However, transactions from customers and outside traders were extremely weak, as most were considering summer settlement. Most were watching and waiting. Long positions from outsiders were also being reduced, so the market atmosphere turned flat and soft again. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment for both near-term and far-term contracts was unfavorable due to slight selling by small factories. Furthermore, there were concerns that the flour sales market in the three northeastern provinces would be monopolized by Japanese merchants in the future. It was rumored that Japanese merchants were selling Flower Flag (American) flour in Dalian at a price of 2.5 yuan in gold currency per large bag. If this rumor is true, the outlets for Shanghai flour will be hit. The softness of sentiment in the afternoon was closely related to this. As a result, the price for this month was down by seven and a half li from the previous week, while the prices for February to May were all down by one and a half fen. June fell by two fen and two and a half li.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened, the prices for various months showed signs of decline. Although foreign wheat prices were up by one jiao, the number of foreign wheat imports recently was very large. Factories and traders were unloading their stocks one after another. Given the current sluggish flour sales, wheat seemed to be in surplus again, so sentiment did not dare to be bullish. Those with goods were thinking of selling them, leading to weakness in all months. As a result, the price for this month was down by three fen from the previous week, February was down by five fen, March was down by four fen, April and May did not open, and June was up by one fen. The spot wheat market was slightly favorable, better than before by three to five fen. Kainansuzhou wheat was 3 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen, Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen, and Bengbu wheat opened at 3 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen, with 3,500 bags reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was still scarce, with only over 30 firms arriving, totaling about 5,000 shi. Although the late rice market was gradually declining in quantity each day, there were not many ups and downs. However, as the outlets were also sluggish, the situation gradually softened. Therefore, yesterday, customer firms purchased over 1,000 bags from both the North and South ocean firms, but it was difficult to set a price. There were adjustments of several fen to nearly one jiao. The thick jing and Duyang jian from various firms were also sluggish, and the market was unusually quiet, leading to a price decline of four or five fen for Zhongguan. The scarcity of Yinyuan (silver dollar) rice slightly firmed the market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over 20 firms of various goods arrived at the port. The market sales were sluggish. The prices for Baijing, Yangdu, Buxiian, and Yinyuan were flat and weak. The prices for early thin rice and Kejian were similar to before.</p>

<p>-Min Bang (Fujianese Merchants) Completely Stop Purchasing-</p>
<p>Although the supply of Ke Xian rice arriving yesterday was not large, demand was very strong. However, due to the current situation, traders have always been hesitant to make large purchases. Due to a lack of ship space, all purchases were stopped yesterday. Zhejiang Province and other scattered customers had no interest. Once Ke Hua was idle, the market trended downward. High-end grades uniformly declined by three to five fen. Local merchants and hoarders took advantage of the lower prices to inquire. A deal was made for 120 bags of Jiangxi early brown rice at a price of 5 yuan, 500 bags of Hunan machine oil at 6 yuan 7 jiao, 100 bags of Caojing at 5 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen, and 356 bags of Yejing at 5 yuan 9 jiao. No other sales were made. However, local hoarders still have an appetite, and they may need to inquire further later.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened further as the customs gold unit fell slightly and the Dutch exchange rate rose slightly. The association's price for ordinary grade 24 coarse sand white sugar was initially called at 19 yuan 1 jiao and a half, but no deal was made. Later, a deal was made at 1 jiao, down 1 jiao from the previous day. Re-export goods were 6 yuan 3 jiao and a half to 3 jiao, down 1 jiao to 5 fen. Grade 20 medium sand white sugar was called at 18 yuan 9 jiao. Dutch red sugar was stable. Grade 8 was 15 yuan 2 jiao, and Grade 9 was 15 yuan 4 jiao. Taikoo sugar also fell by 5 fen. B Mark was 19 yuan 9 jiao and a half, and CW Mark was 19 yuan 8 jiao. Local factory cotton white sugar fell by 5 fen. Zhenji Grade 1 was 18 yuan 1 jiao and a half, Grade 2 was 17 yuan 9 jiao and a half, Grade 3 was 7 jiao and a half, and Grade 4 was 5 jiao and a half. Chao Bang (Chaozhou Merchants) offered over 100 bags of low-grade Chaoqing at prices ranging from 12 yuan to 11 yuan 7 jiao, with not much fluctuation. Jian Bang (Fujianese Merchants) offered dozens of bags of Diaoqing at prices ranging from 11 yuan 8 or 9 jiao. Guang Bang (Guangdong Merchants) offered Zhuqing at 11 yuan 4 jiao, but no deal was made.</p>

<p>The supply of longan has been scarce recently, and prices are flat. According to the investigation, Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel only imported a total of 241 pieces of goods from Tong'an, Zhangzhou, and Anhai through Xiamen. Judging from the number of arrivals, prices should not fall too much.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Oil Market: Crude Soybean Oil Plummets <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has plummeted. The continuous telegrams have shown significant declines, and the sales market has also weakened, causing the market to decline sharply. Since the opening price on the 3rd fell by one yuan, it had triggered a wave of purchases, but sentiment was weak, and purchasing power was thin. Two batches were opened yesterday, one by ship and one by sand boat. Lianqi soybean oil, including 120 pieces by ship at 11 yuan 4 jiao and 100 pieces by sand boat at 5 fen higher. The market continued to fall by 2 jiao compared to last week, and the downward trend has not slowed down at all. Peanut oil is better than soybean oil, but with a deteriorating environment, the trend is also weak. Yesterday, Jiaozhou crude oil only opened at 9 yuan 9 jiao, and 150 pieces were sold.</p>
<h3 id="e198">New Goods after Opening in Hanbai Oil <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Supply not smooth… Large decline, small rebound</p>
<p>Since the decline in Hanbai oil, markets everywhere have become more depressed. The new Chongjing oil arrived in Han some days ago, and there are already a number of shipments available, but the number of new goods is not significant, and the first prices for the year were discussed near the end of the year and set at 16 yuan 4 jiao in customer regulations. New goods from Macheng have remained unchanged since 15 yuan 5 jiao, and supply has not increased due to the shallow water levels in the Yangtze River in the winter. The sales market is also not as strong as in previous years, so a slight turnaround in prices may be possible. Judging from the Han letters, as the number of arrivals is not strong, it will not be easy to see a bottom in the short term. Large declines followed by small rebounds are inevitable. However, according to the data from Jinyi in western Hubei and Macheng, Huangpi, and Xiaogan in northern Hubei, there has been a bumper harvest, and an increase in production is inevitable. However, it can also be determined that sales are far less than in previous years. The uses of Bai oil include candle and soap making, but soap accounts for 70-80% of the usage, while candles only account for 20-30%. Therefore, the focus of sales should be on soap. Judging from previous years, the Hankou China Soap Factory alone (its products are the most famous Xiangmao Soap) used tens of millions of pounds each year, but this year the factory has switched to using cheaper tallow, coconut oil, etc., and Bai oil has become a sacrificial animal. It is said that the factory, due to concerns about excessive usage, feared that the production in various provinces would not be enough to meet its needs, and sent people to investigate the Bai-producing areas, confirming that national production was insufficient to supply the factory's needs. Therefore, taking advantage of the low prices of tallow and coconut oil, the Bai oil manufacturing equipment was removed and replaced with other equipment, which will be out of service for three years. Bai oil should be expected to become cheaper, and when it is restored, the problem of demand exceeding supply can be avoided. Judging from this, the biggest reason for the increasingly declining Bai oil market is this. Furthermore, in the last two or three years, the prices of all goods have fallen, almost returning to the pre-European War levels, and all kinds of oils have been declining sharply, while Bai oil has fallen very little. This also indicates a natural tendency for prices to fall. The candle sales market is also not what it used to be, as candle shops have been doing worse each year. Although this is related to social growth and decline, it is also caused by the bankruptcy of the rural economy. However, prices have been high for a long time, and it is difficult for people to accept them falling in a short period of time. Although the market has declined since the new domestic products were produced this year, it still occupies the highest position compared to other oils, and people still think it is too high. Therefore, the psychology of hoping for a turnaround is very common. If we take a comprehensive calculation and a side-by-side comparison, I am afraid we have not yet reached the lowest limit, but the winter cannot fall to the bottom, all relying on public sentiment to maintain, because there are huge stockpiles everywhere, which can also be used as a temporary pillar. However, stockpilers are not the actual consumers, and once the earth returns to spring, they will inevitably have to be sold on the market, so the market situation at this time may still see drastic changes. At present, during the winter period, even if there is a loose decline, it is still limited. Moreover, it is not possible to form a small group, right? The Jiangxi cargo to this port has been selling as soon as it arrives, without any accumulation. It is reported that the highest brand Yang Chunhe oil was sold for 20 yuan 5 jiao per dan, with the same old scale. Second-grade oil prices also fell accordingly. Traders are selling Chongqing at 21 yuan per ju, Pingjing at 20 yuan, Macheng oil at 17 yuan, and Jiangxi high-grade oil at 17 yuan, slightly more expensive, followed by a price drop. The total market storage is not abundant, and sales are also ordinary. Because the market has been fatigued for a long time, even if there is a slight rise, various firms are still unwilling to stock up too much.</p>

<p>The black sheet iron business on this street has been very prosperous recently, with as many as three or four hundred bundles being sold every day. The business with customer firms is unusually sluggish. Prices for 3-foot and 6-foot goods are estimated at around 11 yuan per dan, while prices for 2-foot and 6-foot goods are at 11 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. According to the investigation, there are not many goods arriving this year, and sentiment is good, so prices are stable.</p>

<p>Chinese silk exports to the United States are on the verge of exhaustion. The United States consumes the most raw silk. Chinese silk shipments to the United States average more than 3,000 bales per month. Since Japanese silk has been sold cheaply in the United States, Chinese silk sales in the United States have gradually declined. Last winter, the Shanghai American firms purchased a limited number of forward and spot silk. Therefore, in the last two months, Chinese silk exports to the United States have been on the verge of exhaustion. The Jianghai Customs export register reported that the silk loaded to the United States in November was only 512 bales, and in December it was only 513 bales, an increase of only one bale compared to November. The artificial silk market has a long exchange rate and stable prices. Recently, foreign exchange has lengthened, and the price of artificial silk has returned to stable. Sales to customers are still smooth. Yesterday, silk merchants from the Lake area imported 28 boxes of recent goods from Aikefa, plain Tedeji Nos. 1 and 2, with a small box price ranging from 181 yuan 2 jiao and a half to 168 yuan 7 jiao and a half, net market price.</p>

<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>I opened today's "Amateur Weekly" section of this newspaper and saw a very large, very glaring word in the "Echoes of Self-Professional Introductions" column: "None." Under the word "None" were three "!" marks, like iron wedges striking a fire bell, accompanied by the words "Save me," also with three "!" marks. After reading it, I couldn't help but feel a chill down my spine. I seemed to faintly hear the sounds of someone hanging themselves and someone jumping into the river. Even after finishing the newspaper, the echo of the words "Save me" continued to buzz in my ears, forcing me to pick up my pen and write this miscellaneous essay.</p>
<p>"Unemployment" is the most common and yet most incomprehensible term in the new dictionary of the twentieth century. It is also a blatant manifestation of the pathology of capitalism.</p>
<p>How can one "lose" a "job"? Except for those who are disabled or unwilling to live, everyone has the right to serve society with their own hands, feet, and brains in exchange for the right to survive. No one has the right to deprive anyone of this right. If a person is unjustly deprived of the right to work, it is tantamount to depriving them of the right to live. Those sons of officials and grandsons of wealthy men rely on their ancestors having held high positions and plundered land, or scheming to seize wealth and lending at high interest rates, accumulating a lot of wicked money, and thus living the kind of extravagant and unrestrained life. Whether they have a "job" or not is irrelevant to them, and whether they "lose" it is even less of a problem. They are originally parasites in society and cannot be regarded as legitimate organs or organizations. It is only the general public who rely on their own labor to exchange for survival who are threatened by unemployment, leading to various tragedies of jumping into the river and hanging themselves. Therefore, the meaning of the two words "unemployment" is not just unemployment, but "loss of life"!</p>
<p>However, this phenomenon is rampant throughout the world.</p>
<p>In today's world, except for the Soviet Union, where is there no panic about unemployment? In the "Kingdom of Gold," the United States, there are currently 16 million unemployed people, in Japan 2 million, and in Italy 3 million. Even in Germany, which is known for its highly developed industry, according to the newly released statistics on the 21st of this month, the number of registered unemployed people is 3,776,000. China has never had statistics, but it is probably not far from 100 million! What is the reason for this? It is said to be "overproduction."</p>
<p>Isn't overproduction a good thing? If there is enough to eat, one can eat better; if there is enough to use, one can use it more comfortably. Isn't this a good thing? However, that is not the case! This is originally a matter for a few wealthy people and has nothing to do with the general public. We can see that in the northwestern United States, the victims of the famine are even gnawing on black bread, while merchants in New York are dumping wheat into the sea and burning cotton, which shows that.</p>
<p>Human beings want to survive, and human beings are born to work. Who wants to be unemployed, and who wants to lose their "survival"? However, some people are forced to "retire," forced to throw themselves into the Huangpu River, swallow opium, and hang themselves. Whose fault is this?</p>
<p>Those who have died are already dead, but there are still tens of millions who, although they have been deprived of the right to "survival," still insist on living. What will they do?</p>
<h3 id="e222">A Quilt <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>—In Memory of My Father Who Sleeps Eternally Underground—</p>
<p>The year I turned eleven was early autumn. I had decided to go to school in the city, so I made special preparations to pack a load. Besides勉強 filling one end with stationery and books, the other end was only filled with a few rustic toys, such as a small trumpet, a shuttlecock, and a paper lion head, which was obviously not enough. One end was so heavy, while the other was so light. So my father came up to me and said, "There's still something to pack! Si'er, go to your eldest brother and get a quilt! I told him a long time ago to have him pad one out for Wu'er to take to school. Go, hurry up!" So quickly, my fourth brother really brought the quilt.</p>
<p>The quilt was thin. The cover was made of official cloth, which was originally white, but perhaps because it had been around for too long, it had clearly turned brownish-yellow. I was used to sleeping warmed in my mother's arms and was very afraid of the cold, so I reached out and felt the quilt. It was thin, and I was just about to say something when my father opened his mouth first: "Wu'er, this quilt may be thin, but the cotton wadding is very good. Feel it. This was made when your eldest brother went to school. It's been over twenty years, and it's still so soft. It's a good quilt!"</p>
<p>That's how I took that quilt to the city's elementary school. The school regulations stated that two people had to share a bed, and the classmate who shared my bed brought a new quilt. Naturally, my quilt became a mattress, so during those three years, I never noticed whether my quilt was good or not, or whether it was warm or not. The three years of elementary school ended, and I went further away to City C to attend middle school. I took that quilt again. In middle school, I slept in a single bed. I used it as a mattress and as a cover. When school started, it was early autumn. Some classmates asked me if I was cold sleeping at night. I said no. I was so young that as soon as I climbed into bed, I was snoring loudly. However, as the temperature dropped day by day, and as the snow came, I was finally woken up by the cold several times in the middle of the night, and that's when I began to feel something about my quilt.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I sneaked into the dormitory alone to take a closer look at the quilt. It was thin and small. I bit open a corner of the quilt, and to my surprise, the cotton wadding was black! However, the economic situation at that time was so dire that it was hard to believe that I was studying in middle school. I could only huddle up and have restless nights, barely making it to the winter vacation.</p>
<p>When I returned home, I told my mother, and my father followed up and said, "That soft quilt, is it still cold to sleep with? It's a good quilt!" I said, "It's really so cold that I can't sleep!" "Then do you want the rotten wadding quilts at home that are like iron plates?" I said, "We'll talk about it when school starts." After all, I never went back to school after that.</p>
<p>Seventeen years later, I threw myself into the embrace of Shanghai. I came as a stowaway. When I was about to leave, I had to shoulder that quilt again. I was a stranger in a strange land, but I didn't feel anything, although some nights were so cold that I looked at the skylight until it turned white.</p>
<p>Because my father was so fond of this quilt, "It's soft, it's a good quilt!" And it was a memento from the beginning of my eldest brother's schooling, I specially wrapped it up and hid it, in case I had the chance to take it back. Last time, I took it back and respectfully presented it to my father. My father said, "It's good that you didn't lose my quilt. I was just about to get a quilt!" He took it in his hand and put it on the bed, and his old, wrinkled face slightly unfolded into a smile, as if he had obtained a treasure.</p>
<p>Now, alas, my father has passed away, leaving the mortal world forever, and sleeping eternally beneath the loess hill! The quilt, that quilt, I am sure it is still preserved. Long-lived quilt, you are even longer-lived than my dear father!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Running Champagne <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, a term has become popular in society, a phrase that has evolved from the meaning of "flattering" – "running champagne." Literally, those who flatter must put in effort on the horse's backside, and those who run champagne must also put in effort on the horse's backside, belonging to the same category. However, changing the two words "flatter" to "running champagne" suddenly gives the feeling that the term "running champagne" is more "modern" than flatter, describing the meaning of the two words "flatter" very thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Flattering" naturally requires flattering, and those who flatter must be horses, but what happens after flattering is unknown. The relationship between the flatterer and the horse, whether flattering the horse out of anger, or whether it is just casual flattering, is not very clear. After flattering, whether the flatterer receives an unyielding hoof from the horse, or just runs away, is not very detailed. As for what impact the horse and the flatterer have on the world and people after a pat, that is even more unknown.</p>
<p>The phrase "running champagne" is different. If we are not "country bumpkins" and have been to Yinxiang Township or the former Jiangwan to watch the Spring and Autumn Champagne Races, then we are familiar with the secrets of this. The person running the champagne (that is, the flatterer) is dependent on the horse for life. If the horse falls, the person running the champagne will also be unlucky, or even travel to Fengdu City, showing that "flattering" is no child's play and is often a matter of life and death. If the horse runs well, the person running the champagne also follows in its wake and runs towards the future together. If the opportunity arises, they will suddenly soar upwards, straight into the blue sky. This is the reason why the person running the champagne does not hesitate to toil and follow the horse on its journey.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is absolutely no coercion or embarrassment in the reason why people "running champagne" "flatter horses," it all comes from willingness. Naturally, horses that can compete successfully in the Champagne Race must be "of great background" and are definitely not inferior horses. Inferior horses are everywhere, and are not worth a "pat" from a "champagne runner." In ancient times, there were often thousand-mile horses, but Bo Le (experts in judging horses) were not common. Now it is different. The "Bo Le" who want to judge horses and pat them are everywhere, as numerous as hairs, while the "thousand-mile horses" worth a pat are as rare as phoenix feathers and cannot be approached. As a result, there is often a phenomenon of "patting any horse that exists," which cannot help but be nauseating. And those who do not know the art of "flattering horses" are inevitably squeezed out and frustrated under the rule of "survival of the fittest." According to the situation of "running champagne," the "flatterer" and the "flattered" both have their purposes and use each other. It is no longer possible to take "flattering horses" as a joke, or as insignificant "flattering horses." If there are any, they belong to the category of "humor" and cannot be compared with serious "flattering horses." Although it is said that the "flatterer" and the "flattered" have mutual interests and use each other, there are times when "flattering horses" makes people uncomfortable. The reason is that the "flattering horses" are done too hastily, and the horse bucks them off the saddle, or they encounter a horse that is born resistant to "flattering." However, horses that are resistant to "flattering" are born proud and are called rebellious horses. They have long been gradually eliminated with the evolution of the world.</p>
<p>Since "running champagne" or "flattering horses" has become a common phenomenon in society, it naturally has a great impact on society. When we see a good horse and a good jockey in the Champagne Race, running almost solely around the competition field in the racecourse with their joint efforts, if we regard society as a competition field, then we can see the situation of these "flatterers" and "flattered" dominating for a while, unparalleled in their time. "Running champagne" people and "run" people obviously regard "flattering horses" as a method of accumulating wealth on the social arena, many "running champagne" people, you pat this horse and I pat that horse, all aiming to run for the "top prize." During this period, there will inevitably be some rises and falls, prosperity and decline, superiority and inferiority. But this does not matter. Although ordinary people's money is taken away, after all, the person who "wins the prize" is extremely prosperous for a time, with foreign money in hand.</p>
<p>China is probably experiencing an economic panic now, and the people's minds are particularly fond of gambling and speculation, vying to buy lottery tickets and champagne tickets, clearly aiming to become the "lucky one" among the panicked masses. This phenomenon is inevitably reflected in major issues of people's livelihood. As a result, the trend of "running champagne" is becoming more and more common. I fantasize like this: once the "horse" no longer exists, these "flattering horse" people will never dominate for a while, and should be included in the list of those to be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Changing Style <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ludi</p>
<p>One of my friends is a skilled landscape painter. However, he is inherently arrogant, and only very close friends can get a glimpse of his work. His studio is filled with copies of paintings, but his own works are all unfinished. Friends asked him what that meant, but he always smiled and said nothing. His strange temper was something that no one among his friends delved into to seek a definite answer. Often, when he smiled and said nothing, they would joke that he hadn't found a suitable copy yet. However—once, he got drunk. He spoke endlessly about his journey of learning to paint and also talked about the strengths and weaknesses of many former painters. He laughed wildly, he was happy, we had never seen him so lost in himself. I brought up the reason for his unfinished works again. He filled a glass of wine and said:</p>
<p>"Because I don't sell paintings, many people who ask me for them are rejected, and they even choose to steal my paintings when I'm not at home. Although I sometimes know who took them, I'm too embarrassed to fall out with them. Now I have so many stacked up, I'm afraid even the garbage collectors would shake their heads when they see them?" He laughed, indicating the ingenuity of his plan. Afterwards, he regretted saying too much after drinking, and I didn't see him for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, I met him in Qipan Street. He was carrying a large roll of paper, running hurriedly. I called him and asked:</p>
<p>"Is it another roll of unfinished works?"</p>
<p>"No, changing style!"</p>
<p>He pulled me to his house. When I entered his studio, I was really surprised. The stack of copies of paintings in one corner, and the pile of unfinished works in another corner, were all cleared away. Replacing them were girls without pants; a nude dancer was spread out on the drawing table.</p>
<p>He placed the roll of paper he was carrying on the end of the table, pointed to the painting, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Isn't it changing style?"</p>
<p>He took out two cigarettes from the tobacco jar, gave one to me, and put one to his own lips. He sat on the drawing table, one leg supporting the floor. His attitude had completely changed, just like his paintings.</p>
<p>"Very good, give me that painting to fill my wall."</p>
<p>"I can't," he shook his leg, "someone ordered this for an advertisement. In a day or two, I'll draw a seascape for you. "Two plumes of white smoke came out of his nostrils, dancing on the dancer's breasts.</p>
<p>"Not painting landscapes anymore?"</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"What about those two piles of unfinished masterpieces?"</p>
<p>"Given to the garbage collectors! Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>It turned out that because of his eccentric temper, he was appreciated by the manager of a cigarette company, who hired him to draw cigarette cards. But his elaborate masterpieces, except for a very few people who nodded, were not as treasured by people as the beauty cards. The manager realized that most people smoked a certain brand of cigarettes for the cards, so he saw that "hard goods" were not popular, and discussed with my friend to change to drawing nude women. At first, he strongly opposed it, preferring to lose his job rather than do it. Later, the manager allowed him to switch to drawing nude women, and if sales did not increase, he would still draw his "hard goods."</p>
<p>So he changed his style, it goes without saying that it was "a hit." The cards were treasured by smokers like antiques, and naturally the sales of cigarettes also swept the country.</p>
<p>My friend saw that changing his style was a success, and gave up his eccentricity when painting landscapes. He worked hard on his nude cards, and it can be said that he exerted his ability to paint sensuality to the extreme. He painted monthly calendars, calendars, advertising paintings, everything... As long as someone asked him, he was happy to do it.</p>
<p>However—I don't believe it. I smoke every day, I read advertisements every day, and I have never been tempted by nude paintings to give up my usual "old brand." If I take myself as a unit, nothing like sensuality and allure is of any use. Today, however, I was given a clear fact. The movie queen, who is usually decorated with grace and wealth, sacrificed her beauty in order to change her style, and it is said that she is fully booked upstairs and downstairs. It can be seen that "nudity" is the supreme success technique. From today onwards, I vow to change my style and specialize in writing sensual articles!</p>

<h3 id="e226">The "Control" Policy of the Chinese Literary Scene <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Lin</p>
<p>I have been away from the Chinese literary scene for a long time. Now that I have nothing to do, I first went to the literary and art market on Simalu (Sima Road) for a tour.</p>
<p>There are indeed many more new books and magazines than before. There are even more emerging writers than hairs. As for the covers, they are even more luxuriously decorated like the fashionable girls on Simalu, dazzling the eyes with their colors. But when you flip through the contents, they are as empty as can be.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese translated planned economy into "controlled economy," this "control" has obviously become popular in our ancient country. This "control" trend is clearly visible in the literary and art world as well. In China, which has always been in a recession, the number of readers has always remained at a very small limit, while the number of writers is constantly increasing, so there is no choice but to "control" it a little. Around each magazine is surrounded by a group of writers like little chicks. No matter how shitty the articles are, they are all put together, and then one or two works by "famous writers" are pulled in from the outside to do some advertising, and one or two manuscripts that cannot be rejected are sent in from the outside, which are considered as external submissions. And so the editor declares success. The group of writers hopes to get more royalties from this "control," to pull in more money, and to move it from the readers' pockets to the dancers' pockets.</p>
<p>However, most of the readers who spend six or seven cents to buy novels and poems at the same time dream of becoming writers themselves and becoming the reserve force for the little chicks. Because in this way, they can not only become famous overnight, but also pull back a little of the money they spent on buying books. However, many large magazines have already been controlled by "great writers," so they have to find another way out and form so-called groups of unknown writers. They just have one magazine on the left and one magazine on the right. As these unknown writers squeeze around, the "control" of the great writers has not yet been successful!</p>
<p>The complaints and sentimentality of many great writers at present are mostly a variation of this melancholia!</p>
<p>However, recently some people have been advocating "suppression" again. Of course, suppression is just the other side of control. Control is carried out in secret, so the market is still a market after all. "Wildfires can't burn them out, the spring breeze blows them back to life." How can the wildfires compare to the spring breeze!</p>

<p>Editor Sir: I am currently thirty-five years old. My father unfortunately passed away when I was sixteen and still studying. Now, my mother is managing the household. My parents gave birth to four of us siblings. My older brother, three years my senior, unfortunately died young at the age of twenty-four before getting married. Now, only my brother, sister, and I remain. My younger brother got married last autumn; my sister is just twenty and not yet engaged. My brother and I work in the same profession, earning eight or nine dollars each month. Our family still has over ten acres of farmland, the grain from which covers our annual expenses. My own monthly salary is sixteen dollars, two-thirds of which I give to the family, leaving me with only four or five dollars for personal spending. This also covers social expenses, clothing, and annual travel expenses back home. My wife has given birth to three daughters. Throughout the year, besides food and housing, she doesn't manage a single piece of cloth or penny and still squeezes money from my one-third salary. There are also unexpected expenses, leaving me extremely strained. Now, my mother is still making trouble, saying I'm secretly hoarding money, eating their rice, and using their resources. She asks what we need money for when we're away. She doesn't question my brother's spending, only argues with me. I'm not boasting, but I am quite aware of social etiquette, believing in fulfilling one's duties. As the saying goes, "There are no wrong parents." I try to be accommodating in everything to avoid ridicule. Being far away from home, I try to avoid hearing and being bothered by their gossip. The women in my family, including my mother, wife, sisters-in-law, and brothers' wives, not only fail to support each other but also take pleasure in mocking and criticizing, even speaking indirectly. My wife, burdened with three children, inevitably lags behind in some tasks compared to them, leading to frequent quarrels. When I'm away, my ears are constantly filled with these rumors, causing me anxiety. If this becomes a chronic condition, both my personal life and family affairs will be ruined. If I suggest separating the household, I fear they won't agree. After much deliberation, I have no good solution. I beg you, sir, to help me as soon as possible! Wishing you peace in your writing, respectfully submitted by Lü Ming.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: If Mr. Lü has the financial means to be independent, we would support him in setting up his own household and forming a small family. Although they may scold you for being unfilial and abandoning your elderly mother, the income from the family property is sufficient to support their lives, allowing you to console yourself both legally and morally. However, Mr. Lü's income is only fifteen or sixteen dollars a month, and he has a wife and three daughters. In the near future, he may even have more mouths to feed. Realistically, setting up an independent household would also create problems. In a society where the economic system hasn't been broken down, it is sadly true that even the relationships between parents and children are inevitably governed by economics. Therefore, you can hold two hopes to avoid being overwhelmed by sorrow and short-sightedness. The first hope is for an increase in your income. Through hard work and experience, this is very possible. With increased income, supply and demand will be balanced, leading to favorable outcomes. The second hope is that all feasts must come to an end. The burden of this large family won't last forever, and you will have plenty of time to develop your own life in the future. Furthermore, we know that misunderstandings often cause disagreements. If mother and son can be open and honest with each other, there should be no misunderstandings that cannot be resolved. Mr. Lü can also repeatedly guide his wife with the above two hopes, lest she become impatient during this short period of endurance and cause unexpected incidents.</p>

<p>— Che Shu</p>
<p>Afterward, I gave them an explanation:</p>
<p>"Don't overestimate me, and don't think I'm too bad. I am neither a bad nor a good person! You should know that I am just as ordinary as you are—that's good, that's how you should see me. If you think too highly of me, you will inevitably be disappointed. Thinking too badly of me is also wrong. In short, I am the same as you. I'm not completely without courage, but I don't have much. There are times when I am willing to sacrifice, and there are times when I am not. There are times when I put aside personal interests, and there are times when I don't forget myself—but I say what I think, so there are contradictions. What I said before may not be applicable later. We are like this, still unable to completely abandon selfish desires; we are still in the process of overcoming them.</p>
<p>"And frankly, don't expect others to give you enjoyment—this world is entirely yours, but you must use your strength to obtain it!"</p>
<p>They thought too highly of me, and this was based on my giving them things to eat. But how could I be completely open and share everything equally—as it is, I can only eat one-fifth of my rations.</p>
<p>This is often the reason for the cracks between us—because this foundation is unreliable. They find it difficult to understand us, and they don't want to understand us. At most, they can only know that I am a good person, but they don't understand my thoughts. This is what makes me sad—</p>
<p>It's really difficult to be a wealthy political prisoner. If you have to ask them to buy something for you ten times, and you only buy it nine times, they will forget everything and hate you. It's difficult for those feelings to fully merge. Poor political prisoners are not like that, so they often gain the trust of ordinary prisoners.</p>
<p>10th</p>
<p>The people here have deep friendships with fellow villagers. The narrow-minded concept of home is very strong, and the further they go, the stronger their sense of belonging to their hometown becomes. This trend increases because their sense of isolation increases as they enter an unfamiliar environment. This is based on mutual help.</p>
<p>11th</p>
<p>I submitted a report requesting to work, citing the lack of activity as the reason. The Deputy Warden of the Second Section approved it, saying—"The prison stipulates that there must be exercise time every day, why ask for more exercise?"</p>
<p>But heavens, it's been more than a week since we had exercise. Many days when we could have exercised were given up. When the yard is dry, they only do the things when dry, not when wet; we prisoners who are locked up can't go to see the yard; if they don't come to open the door, don't take us out, we can't call anyone. Our how only depends on their conscience—assuming they have a conscience—however it may be. But their conscience only thinks of their own comfort and doesn't care about the distress of more than a thousand prisoners lacking activity and their future decline.</p>
<p>Each exercise time is at most ten minutes. Such a long time for him—the warden in charge of exercise—is an invaluable favor that he doesn't know how to estimate for the prisoners. Appearing like ten minutes is so long, a smile appears on his face. He tells us this is a preferential treatment for us. Because his conscience feels relieved. But we often hear it said when the deputy warden and others accompany visitors past the small iron windows in front of the cells—"Two hours of exercise every day." Sometimes they say—"Prisoners return to their cells during mealtimes, and the rest of the time is spent in the exercise yard."</p>

<h3 id="e230">World Literary Masterpieces and Chinese Cinema (Part 1) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>It is said that Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and Storm's "Immensee" are going to be adapted into Chinese films.</p>
<p>But why were these two works chosen?</p>
<p>They do have very important significance in China's liberal literary movement. Guo Moruo translated "The Sorrows of Young Werther," "Which young man does not fall in love, which young woman does not yearn for spring," and the doctrine of love-above-all-else became the creed of liberal youth; it is said that there are more than three translations of "Immensee," which shows how madly and truly it was loved by the youth at that time.</p>
<p>The rise of China's emerging bourgeoisie during World War I created the social foundation for the liberal literary movement. So-called liberal literature is, in content, opposed to feudalism and often contains patriotism and nationalism. To oppose feudal society, the feudal idol Confucius had to be attacked. On the issues of love and marriage, liberalism widely expressed its rebellion against feudal society. Therefore, the doctrine of love-above-all-else became the backbone of the new liberal literature. In terms of form, it also required liberation from classical literary forms, which is the so-called "vernacular literature" movement, and the modernization of article structure.</p>
<p>In this liberal literary movement, translation undertook the task of laying the foundation. "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and "Immensee" were both very dutiful. We must admit that they both greatly influenced Chinese liberal literary works. However, we feel that now, after several decades since the May Fourth Movement, these two works have lost their significance.</p>
<p>We still need to criticize feudal forces, but we are no longer criticizing them from a liberal standpoint; criticizing feudal society from a socialist perspective is now our task.</p>
<p>Of course, introducing world literary masterpieces is a very commendable plan, and we very much hope that our film industry can work hard in this area; but we must not overestimate the educational mission of film; truly, from the perspective of literary history, in addition to explaining the social basis that produced these literary works, and their historical status, we must also discuss the significance of the works in the present, and the attitude we should take towards them (because this is the task of literary history.) Therefore, before thinking about adapting literary works into films, we should carefully consider the counter-effects of these works on society. Do we really need them?</p>
<p>We know that the situation when first-rate masterpieces such as "Don Quixote" came to China was like this: it only ran for a short four days and then quietly slipped out of Shanghai. It was not that the cinema intentionally antagonized "Don Quixote"; nor was there a lack of general publicity before the premiere, "Don Quixote's" status in literary history was the most powerful publicity; nor was it that film critics did not properly recommend it to the audience after the premiere, the art of Pabst and Chaliapin had been carefully examined; it was the reason that the general audience did not understand the sadness of "Don Quixote's" declining era. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e231">Review of "Red-Haired Iron Blood" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>I Was A Spy</p>
<p>| I Guanglu Lanxin Screening |</p>
<p>The World War of 1914-1918 was caused by the behavior of imperialists around the world plundering markets and seizing colonies. The slogans of fighting for the motherland, for mankind, and for justice have long been proven to be nothing more than deceitful words from a few imperialists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, in the midst of the unprecedented and brutal war, a second, more violent war is brewing. There are still those who yearn for the Allied Powers who participated in this great war, believing that they were fighting for "human compassion and indignation." This must be said to be a serious mistake.</p>
<p>Regarding this, we can see it very clearly in the British Gaumont company's film "Red-Haired Iron Blood."</p>
<p>It tells the story of a Belgian girl, Marisa, who, in 1915 when the war was in full swing, saw the painful situation of wounded soldiers being transported back from the front lines. Disregarding her parents' advice and differences in race, she resolutely "adhered to the compassionate spirit of heaven and aroused people's sympathy and indignation" and entered the rear hospital of the German army as a nurse. Seeing the cruelty of the German army, she became even more indignant and joined the Allied detective department as a spy, risking her life to help the Allied forces. Although the matter was later revealed and she was arrested, her lover in the party confessed and she was spared from death. When the Scottish army arrived in Belgium, she was able to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>The center of the story is clearly to declare to the people of the world for their old-brand imperialism: First, only our British Empire's army is fighting for human justice. Second, only under the rule of our British Empire will you oppressed and small nations have the day to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>It is understandable for a British film to promote Britain. There is nothing to be criticized, but the fear is that our compatriots will be affected by this propaganda, anesthetized, or deceived. Therefore, we specifically point out that only standing on the position of the nation, the position of the oppressed, and opposing imperialism, and opposing the war of imperialist plundering of markets and seizing colonies, is worthy of heroic participation and worthy of special praise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the production of this "Red-Haired Iron Blood," I feel that except for a few scenes, such as digging tunnels, blowing up ammunition depots, and secret rendezvous between Allied detectives on the streets, which are too dramatized, everything else, from directing to acting, is excellent.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Thoughts After Watching "Flames of Youth" <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Qimei</p>
<p>From "Flames of Youth," I discovered three common problems shared with other works:</p>
<p>(1) In film works, the protagonist is certainly important, but the acting of the supporting roles must also be "appropriate to their status" to be worthy of being called a supporting role. However, because most producers are short-sighted, they only direct a few protagonists! Other than that, they are pretty girls and boys! The other characters are just凑凑而已! In "Flames of Youth," Lan Fen's mother is extremely clumsy and sluggish, and can only be moved like a puppet. Some people say, "Movies are a reflection of social life." Then, what does Chinese cinema reflect? Only dashing girls and boys, and clumsy and sluggish old people.</p>
<p>(2) Presumably the producers want to show the wealth of their owners, so the center of the themes they depict is deliberately placed on a generation of "upper-class Chinese." The interior scenes in the film, except for occasionally and unavoidably adopting some slum scenes, are almost all European and American equipment enjoyed by upper-class Chinese. The setting of middle-class families is very rare. For example, the magnificent architecture and luxurious equipment in Lan Fen's home are very unexpected. Even if Lan Fen's home is so luxurious, how could her mother be so shabby? Xiangru visited Mengxian's new home, but she didn't take a car or have servants, and followed her daughter like an old nanny in casual clothes. Although it is said that the wealthy may be frugal and humble, but the movie pays attention to reality, of course, what it performs must also be accommodated by reality!</p>
<h3 id="e233">Review of "Salt Tide" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Usually after watching a domestic film, we always have a feeling of "unreality." In terms of the actors' expressions, they are either stiff, or excessive, or add many unnecessary scenes, and omit useful scenes.</p>
<p>However, in "Salt Tide," there are no such shortcomings. Its subject matter is very real, and the actions of each actor are not idealized. (In domestic films, there are often many characters who are too idealized, which is really the only reason for their failure.)</p>
<p>In terms of directing, we cannot but admit that Xu Xinfu has achieved great success. Among them, the changes in Ah Feng's (Hu Die's) emotions before and after are portrayed vividly. For example, her hesitation to go forward when delivering the melon, and her moving to a broom (?), amidst the anger of the crowd, to tear the leaves forcefully to express the remorse in her heart, are all very good.</p>
<p>The photography is also very good, and there are many beautiful scenes that are fascinating; especially in the salt field, the cooperation of light and shadow and the angle of the camera are excellent!</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Hu Die, who plays Ah Feng, and Gu Meijun, who plays Ah Qiao, are the most successful. Ah Feng's gentleness and honesty, and Ah Qiao's innocence and romance, are all natural and truly expressed. The rest, such as Chen Bingsheng's (Wang Zhengxin's) strength and Zhang Desan's (Wang Mengshi's) caution, are also performed fairly well.</p>
<p>But there are a few minor flaws:</p>
<p>1. Chen Bingsheng's illness has no appearance of illness.</p>
<p>2. There is only one salt police officer arresting Zhang Desan, which seems insufficient.</p>
<p>3. The furnishings in Li Da's household and the arrangement of the banquet are too luxurious, which may not be suitable for the situation in the countryside.</p>
<p>In short, this film has a tight structure, a tense plot, and especially the final use of blazing flames to end, which gives the audience a deep impression.</p>
<h3 id="e234">After Watching "Salt Tide" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang You</p>
<p>(Omitted above) In "Salt Tide," we see the poverty of the countryside, the hardship of the salt people's lives, and it also exposes the cunning of urban hooligans, the exploitation of the oppressing class, and the collusion between local tyrants and corrupt officials. Therefore, in terms of consciousness, "Salt Tide" is very substantial.</p>
<p>The screenwriter added a love story to the film in order to increase the twists and turns of the plot, which is also very appropriate.</p>
<p>Director Xu Xinfu has made great progress in performance compared to before. The description of the plot and the handling of the scenes are all clean and appropriate. The control of the camera angle is also very skillful. Unfortunately, the climax of the great struggle at the end of the film lacks emotion and air.</p>
<p>The actors' performances are not bad, especially Gu Meijun has made even faster progress, bringing out the innocence and romance of the country girl. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e235">Review of "Flames of Youth" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ting</p>
<p>Tianyi self-proclaimed that the champion work of 1933, "Flames of Youth," although it does not have the "poetic" beauty as they advertised, it does contain a bit of beauty. From the story, it is realistic; from the performance, it is healthy; from the consciousness, it is correct.</p>
<p>The director's skills are commendable, and the hints in many places are used very appropriately. He doesn't show you nakedly what you hope to see, he uses another means to let you imagine for yourself, which is very playful and very smart. Actors like Chen Yumei's innocence is very satisfying. Although Ye Qiuxin's movements are not very skilled, her facial expressions have made significant progress. Yu Guang can still match the identity of the protagonist in the play. There is nothing worth saying about the other actors.</p>
<p>As for the scenery and photography, there are no particularly great or special shots, but they are generally satisfactory. In short, "Flames of Youth" is a work of diligent progress from the standpoint of national films.</p>

<p>— Hui Lan</p>
<p>The orderly recently reported that the morale of the soldiers was extremely indignant and asked for instructions. Zhi Chao instructed, "Send orders to Adjutant Yang to have the railway bureau prepare a train. This regiment will definitely depart tomorrow morning." After he finished speaking, he took down the military cap hanging on the wall. Man Lin jumped up and hugged Zhi Chao, refusing to let go. Zhi Chao pushed Man Lin to the ground and turned away without looking back.</p>
<p>Hometown—the scenery is still the same hometown, Xiao Fen is holding her child and walking towards the door of her home, but Gui Sheng is nowhere to be found. Fortunately, she was pointed out by an old neighbor and found her father, Gui Sheng, in a land temple, but Gui Sheng could not speak after seeing his daughter. After Gui Sheng died, she cried constantly. Suddenly she heard a clamor outside the temple. She also heard, "Welcome the Twenty-Sixth Division to go to the pass to kill the enemy!" "Support the Sixty-Eighth Regiment to defend the country!"</p>
<p>The excitement of the masses was very enthusiastic. Xiao Fen came out and saw the words "Sixty-Eighth Regiment," her eyes seemed to light up. A team of elementary school students mixed in with the masses were shouting, "Go to the station! Welcome the soldiers who will fight against imperialism, welcome the commander of the desperate Li Zhi Chao regiment!" Xiao Fen heard these three words and immediately became angry. She angrily turned back to the land temple, thinking and looking around, picked up a rusty knife, hid it in her pocket, and went out holding her child. The train station, filled with cheering crowds, Xiao Fen holding the child also squeezed into the cheering crowd. Everyone invited the division commander to speak. The division commander said that he had nothing to say and asked Li, the commander of the regiment who first requested to go to the front line, to give a speech on behalf of the division. So Li Zhi Chao walked onto the steps of the train. The cheers of the masses, the gnashing of teeth of Xiao Fen, Zhi Chao very brave very earnestly: "Compatriots! We are very grateful, but only ashamed. Historically, soldiers have really let down the people of the whole country who support us!</p>
<p>Xiao Fen took a step forward, tightly holding the rusty knife in her hand. Li Zhi Chao then said, "But now is the opportunity for us soldiers to atone for our sins to the masses. We must use our blood to fight imperialism!"</p>
<p>The crowd cheered and applauded, and the soldiers also excitedly cheered together. Xiao Fen became even more nervous, but seemed a little moved. Then he said, "Compatriots! This is our last meeting. In order to protect our country, none of the brothers want to come back! Remember! Everyone must stand up! To overthrow the imperialism that is invading China!"</p>
<p>The masses cheered loudly, some elderly farmers shed tears, and some stood up to give speeches. Xiao Fen was also deeply moved, lowered her head, and pondered again and again. She was already weeping. She looked up again and looked at Zhi Chao's sincere and tragic attitude. Her heart was simply swayed. She looked at the baby in her arms, and then looked at the knife in her hand. Slowly her hand loosened, and the knife fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The whistle sounded, and the train gradually moved amidst the cheers of the people. The soldiers stretched out their hands from the windows and waved constantly. Zhi Chao also waved his hand, and the masses waved their hands and handkerchiefs to see them off. Xiao Fen hated them but also raised her hand, her face full of tears, but was also led by the cheers of the masses, and waved her hand with a slight smile. (End)</p>
