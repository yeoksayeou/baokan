<p>丨丨由德國節食運動說到中國慈善事業丨丨</p>
<p>德國國社黨近提倡類似宗敎儀式之「節食日。」擬普及全國。以此項節省所得之欵。救濟失業之貧民。其效果究竟能否如所預期。則殊値得研究。自國社黨執政以還。於整個德國經濟問題。初未有具體之計劃。惟失業人數一年來確已减低至三百二十餘萬。不可謂非國社黨努力之成績也。</p>
<p>夫德國受四圍各國之制限。在歐洲發展。固在在與凡爾賽和約相觝觸。卽欲開拓海外市塲。亦因世界列强早已劃定範圍。不容輕易染指。近年來國際經濟鬥爭愈演愈烈。關稅戰爭之餘。繼之以貨幣戰爭。而另一戰略之經濟聯盟運動。亦將由理論而進至於實踐。戰前之德意志。以其高度發展之工商業與英國相抗爭。尙不能得志於海外市塲。遑論今日。卽如美國工業與夫金融資本之獨占組織。並不弱於德國。而天賦之豐厚。地理之形勝。且過德國十。倍乃仍困處於恐慌狂潮之中。設盡方法僅堪掙扎。然則德意志之困難固不言可知也。</p>
<p>今日德國爲敷衍目前。以節食濟貧爲臨時救急辦。法固無不可。以德人習於多年之鬥爭生活。詎不知此種辦法終非了局。惟限於環境。旣不能從事於武力戰爭以打開出路。又不能以和平方法取得國外市場。則其在内部厲行之節食運動。應有相當之意義。但欲恃此一端。而求長治久安之道。則殊不可靠。卽如消極的救災恤貧辦法。在我中國施行已久。非但慈善機關林立。卽依佈施以爲生活之人。亦不在少數。如北平施粥。每年冬季前往粥廠受領者均在三十萬左右。此誠足爲中國民生困苦之特殊反映。然而此類救濟。究非根本方法。蓋旣不足以濟貧。更不足以解决當前之困厄。消極救濟之舉。萬難長遠支持。而慈悲之心亦僅能偶爾觸發。設使長期如此。則不勞而獲之人多。潛心工作反不如坐以待食之爲得計也。我國歷來之反亂。多由於民生問題不得相當之解决。卽號稱賢能政府。根本上對於民生問題。亦僅有理想。而無實際設施。是以治亂循環之說。迄今依然未能澈底打破。吾人鑑於以往之歷史。默察當前之情形。能不惕然自懼。思所以根本補救之道耶。補救之道唯何。曰第一當如中央歷次所宣言。卽日廢棄一切苛捐雜稅。培養民間元氣。第二農村經濟旣瀕於破産絶境。即須積極推進復興運動。其間關於農業金融農業技術糧食調劑及水利等四計劃。業經農村救濟委員會决定爲努力事項。自應以事實成績表現政府所抱之决心與誠意。第三何應欽氏前所提倡之節約運動當自執政大員以身作則。推行及於全國。第四以科學技術發展各項生産事業俾如許失業。者及生活不安定之人民。得一安居樂業之塲所。</p>

<p>全國生産有改組必要</p>
<p>統制經濟無背於憲法</p>
<p>民治已失效斷行新制</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統以無綫電廣播演說、解釋全國生産改組之必要、略謂當一九一九至廿九年時、國家經濟如中狂疾、其時竟無人提出任何計劃、以避免生産過剩之害、亦無人尋覓一種方式、俾民衆對於無力購買之物、仍可以購買之、又謂在此數年之間、當局與人民皆毫無振作、以致政府權力、旁落於若干團體之手、而此種團體之目的、乃在謀若干階級之私利者也、至於現政府所行之經濟復興計劃、其主要精神、乃在最大可能限度以内、力謀最大多數人民生活之改善、其法在增加工資、以恢復購買能力、發展對外貿易、以求農工業之均衡、總之在代議制政府之下、實行經濟統制政策、實與美國憲法所定原則不相違背云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>改組生産交換制度　羅總統又謂、美國人民其年年收入不足二千元者、購入國内所售物品三分之二、故此輩所獲工資逐漸增多、則商家僱主與投資家終可因物品銷數增多、而收入愈豐、一年前當事業頽隳之際、吾人以合法手續、擔任改組生産與交換之制度、今必使此改組垂諸久遠、</p>
<p>資富權力務求平均　社會狀况使大部份人民存在於不合美利堅化之狀况中、並使資富與權力分配不均者、吾人决不可再許有之、在此新事業進行時、各方面參加此新事業之願意、現已較前顯著、如余頃接美國銀行公會來電、代表全國銀行表示其信任與誠意、願贊助復興國家之努力一事、卽其證也、美國銀行結構穩健、現在營業之各銀行、其地位之穩固爲前所未有、其狀况已達到流動已極之點、諸君試回思一年前之今日、彼時銀行立於何種地位、諸君皆知之、今銀行公會之來電、乃已有進步之明證、</p>

<p>＝日本憑藉武力如荒山餓虎擇肥而噬＝</p>
<p>＝俄政府現正聯絡友邦以期增厚實力＝</p>
<p>巴黎通信、中國駐俄大使顔惠慶、月前離俄返國、道經新加坡時、曾發表關於日俄戰爭勢難避免之談話、此項談話、頗引起法國一般人之注意、而法國大多數報紙、亦均據作評論之資料、最顯著者、如勞勃脫波倫氏（ＲobertPoulaine）在巴黎雜誌内所著之論文、題爲「日俄戰爭之發生可能歟抑一定歟」、據波氏意見、兩國戰爭、斷難避免、其所持重要理由、爲日本正値軍閥勢力澎漲時代、軍閥有充分併吞滿、洲之野心、而蘇俄實爲其障礙物、故不得不消除之、現在日本國内之海陸軍、實足稱雄於世界、海軍雖以倫敦軍備恊定之約束、仍可與英海軍相頡頏、日本天皇以次、陸軍領袖、如陸相荒木、深得民衆之信仰、已形成該國之狄克推多、故在日本軍人、幾如荒山餓虎、擇肥而噬、據波氏在滿洲所得之觀察、覺日兵之耐勞性、較各國軍士爲優、每日嘗携食米少許、魚一條、及茶少許、步行四十里而不倦、且皆受過相當敎育、每團兵士一千五百人内、不諳文字者僅十五人、如以法國每團兵士而論、則其比率爲百分之三十與三十五也、波氏旋述及去年八月間、東京横濱二處民衆、全體動員、練習天空自衞操演、歷時三畫夜之久、在操演時、男女青年向各界勸募者、計二萬五千人、代政府募得之欵、不下一千萬法郎、日本民衆對於軍事之熱忱、及其犧牲精神、難能可貴、義勇軍能作爲人類魚雷者、遠超於徵定之數、一旦國家有事、此項魚雷、隨時能爆發也、尤可慮者、日本人民年增一百萬、現全部人民已達六千萬、爲其六千萬居民之給養計、不得不佔據滿洲、蓋滿洲旣無歐洲任何國家與其競爭新市塲、同時又爲其國防上所需原料之貯藏所、</p>
<p>自美俄復交以後、日本深知日俄間難有存立恊約之望、故爲國家安全計、日後將在海參崴鄰近海岸省分及庫頁島北部、有所佔據、以竟其侵略滿洲之計劃、</p>
<p>波氏之消極見解、深爲莫斯科政府表同情、莫斯科政府實不願有何戰爭發生、但深覺遲早將爲日本所威脅、莫斯科政府現方改變政策、凖備與「中級」政府、簽訂不侵犯條約及商約等、以期增厚抗日實力云云、（世界社）</p>
<h3 id="c92">日人經營拉濱鐵路完成（長春通訊） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>丨缩短北滿與日本間之交通路線丨</p>
<p>日人經營之敦圖線、（卽敦化至圖們爲吉會鐵路的變相）已於去年四月間完成、拉濱線復由日人滿鐵會社、受僞組織之委任、亦於去年十二月十三日試車、該線全長凡二百六十二公里、起自吉圖路上之拉法站、至北滿經濟中心之濱江止、横斷吉林省之西部、越中東鐵路而使北滿物産散集地濱江（哈爾濱）與日本内地間之距離縮短、並爲北滿鐵道網之神經中樞、自濱江經該路至拉法、復由拉法經敦圖線至北朝魚羅津港、較自哈爾濱南下至大連之距離、縮短二百零七公里、又昔日北滿與日本間之最短路線、爲自濱江經朝鮮鐵道至下關之二千零二十公里、今則經拉濱線出羅津而至敦賀、不過一千六百十六公里、換言之、卽北滿中心地至日本内地間之距離、涸拉濱線與敦圖綫之完成、而縮短三百九十六公里之長度、故此路之完成、使北滿與日本間之交通、闢一新紀元、而於日本侵略滿洲之軍事上經濟上、增加一有效之武器、</p>
<p>該路之全長、雖不過二百六十二公里、然其工程方面、則有驚人之處、如該路與呼海路連接處之松花江鐵橋、長計一公里又十分之四、較昔日稱爲東北大工程之中東路鐵橋、更長三十一米突、卽鴨綠江鐵橋、亦所不及、該橋爲雙層式、上層行人馬、下層架鐵路、建築費用達四百二十萬元、就其規模與形式言之、可謂爲東北第一條大橋、又該路間有一著名之太平嶺隧道、長六百九十米突、亦爲該線大工程之一、</p>
<p>沿線風景、與東北其他鐵路大不相同、鐵路沿山麓蜿蜒而行、沿線均爲森林、故日人於建築時、特在鐵路兩旁各闢地五十米突、而留相當距離間隔之樹木、爲天然之電桿、故今日經行該處、惟見二三尺小樹、不復見昔日蒼綠幽鬱掩天蔽日之原林矣、</p>
<p>該路建築之目的、與日人加工趕成之用、意、一方面固在於使北滿與日本内地間之距離縮短、以充分吸收北滿豐富之資原另一方面、日本爲應付當前日趨緊張之日蘇戰雲、縮短運兵之路綫、使日本内地軍隊、得以迅速達到北滿、而侵入蘇境、又該路沿綫各地、本爲我義軍隱匿出没區域、日人爲圖消滅我義軍而趕築此路、蓋亦爲原因之一、</p>
<p>自該路完成後、因出海距離縮短、同稱爲北滿交通脈之中東鐵路、已喪失其效用、沿綫本站之城市有五常·拉林等、日鮮農民、移殖於此者日衆、沿綫温度頗低、冬季常逹零下三四十度、故旅行該路者、惟見爲白雪所掩之原野與蒼天混成一色而已、</p>

<p>吳氏復述及繳納保證金問題、交通部前以謀拍發電報人在手續上之便利及迅速起見、凡拍發電報較多之行號住户、按月先行繳納保證金若干、此項保證金、由電報局存放郵政儲金匯業總局、給以利息、此種辦法、對於拍發電報人可免每次省電時有計費之週折、而時間上迅速不少、蓋交通部之此舉、目的惟求客商之便利耳、</p>

<p>昨函總經理請收回减工成命</p>
<p>美亞織綢廠工人、近因廠方裁减工資、發生罷工風潮、各工會昨集商組織罷工委員會、並擬定期向黨政機關請願、茲將經過詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>减工經過　　昨據工人方面發表、本月二日下午一時馬浪路一廠、交通路二廠、膠州路三四兩廠、（巳合併）斜土路五六兩廠、瞿眞人路七廠打浦橋八廠、汶林路九廠、八士橋十廠等各廠廠長、曾召集工人發表談話、謂去年度本廠織品産額較之歷年爲佳、惟入歲以來、各地迄無定貨、此足證明鷥綢銷路、已趨退化、本廠爲預防未然起見、計擬將薪俸工資略事减削迨至下午二時、各廠卽布告實行减低工資、</p>
<p>工人憤激　美亞各廠工人總數、共四千餘名、見此布告、羣示不滿、緣去年七月一日廠方曾以絲綢銷路不振、將所有工價、一律九折給發、當時因避免勞資間增加惡感起見、故未與較量、不意爲時僅半載、資方竟又减工、除經緯廠縴經部及藝徒曁魯班路染煉廠外、其他各部工人、均先後罷工、其减工之標凖、以現有工資减爲八五折、本年度廠方對職員、曾加以裁减、近又佈告月薪在二十六元以上者、酌量减削、</p>
<p>組罷工會　各廠工人先後罷工後、以原有工會、業已取消、誠恐在此罷工期間、不良份子、從中活躍、特於昨日上午、集合每廠代表二人、商整個辦法、當議决、（一）要求恢復二十二年上半年度之工資、（二）書面呈請總理收回成命、（三）如無結果、定期向社會局請願、（四）組設罷工委員會便利交涉、</p>

<p>均受損壞　信平輪三四艙被撞成一洞、毛釘鐵板均損壞、幸在水平綫以上、尙無大碍、當卽駛至金利源碼頭黄浦江三四號浮筒停泊、大興輪船頭鐵釘稍受損壞、當駛至北票碼頭停泊、經船主查騐後、損壞甚微、惟信平輪損壞較重、聞鹽艙已有水浸入、</p>
<p>昨日騐船　信誠輪船行、當將信平輪被撞經過、呈交通部航政局請求查騐、昨日上午十時、航政局派騐船師王新元先赴金利源浮筒查騐信平輪、繼赴北票碼頭查騐大興輪、信誠輪船行、昨將信平輪損壞詳情、函安通輪船公司交涉、</p>
<p>依法公斷　大興輪前日起、已在北票碼頭卸煤、行將卸竣、安通公司亦將互撞經過呈報交通部上海航政局、今因兩公司均爲華商、將來責任問題、决由航政局碰撞委員會、依法公斷</p>

<p>但是，在文學上博得成功，還有一面，你不得不加注意。文學的成功不僅是在文字的形式，最重要的還要看内容，看你寫的是代表什麽人而發言，是否合於時代的要求和拍子呢？是否眞的對社會有相當的認識？對社會各羣團生活很親切？譬如你寫的那篇「殁落時代的殘骸」，在意識方面，你雖然表示了「這有什麽可憐呢，這是歷史時代賜予的應有的運命」，但結果你還是「從衣袋裏摸出所有的幾隻銅板來」，全篇的氣氛屯仍充滿着人道主義的氣氛，並帶上一點傷感的味兒。至於取材方面，用了從「大餅店裏去偷一個大餅，被該店裏的夥計用老虎灶裏的鐵棒打傷，還用開水……」卽令這是事實，卽令我們用新寫實主義的手法，我想用一大餅店夥計去代表所有的者殘忍，如果照實的寫出，像映在鏡子裏一般，反而成了自然主義的手法，把羣團間的對抗的方面，弄得更不明瞭了；更不用說到「暗示」，「大家都有點憤憤然！」這完全是仁慈的心，没有找到眞正憤怒的對象呀！（至少是不甚明白。）</p>
<p>關於「殁落時代的殘骸」中的剪材是不甚高明的丨丨請恕我不客氣丨丨但這篇作品仍是一篇進步的作品，它的意識是正確的，當前確是現出了一個殁落時代的殘骸，可惜這樣好的内容還没找到更適合的形式，這一點大概是作者對於新寫實主義還缺少了解，不知不覺中還受到自然主義的影響罷？糾正這項缺點，我想，以作者的才華是不難辦到的，只要多留心幾部新寫實主義的表現法就够了。</p>
<p>再，就表現方面而言，也不僅是文字工拙的問題而是對於社會羣團親切與否，同情與否而定，新寫實主義不是標語口號而是大衆生活的生活、在動態中的記錄與指引。譬如就上面所舉的大作說，它不過是一篇小品，還不能稱爲小說，因爲人物方面的描寫，周圍環境的構圖，却還不合小說的條件，如果就一篇完整的小說而論，那就頗不容易，要寫出自巳不熟習的環境，人物，結果是會走到唯心的方面去，不僅淺薄無聊，而在文字的表現上也决不能獲得相當的成就。所以，我們主張，一個新的作家，努力的方向，如果在文字技巧上費去了百分之二十的精力，在内容方面就得費百分之八十的精力。我們不惜重複的　說，一個新寫實作家，他應有正確的宇宙觀，世界觀和社會觀，他應是大衆中的一個，不是一個旁觀者，同情者；他應熟知大衆生活，意志，要求，並能爲大衆發言。</p>
<p>同時，他也應學習新的形式的表現方法，批判的接受前人的遺産。</p>
<p>話說得太多了，關於寫作方面，暫卽止此。不對的地方，還請你批評。</p>
<p>最後，對於你的讀書計劃，還有下面兩項意見：</p>
<p>一·文藝方面，應加讀幾本文藝理論的名著。</p>
<p>二·布哈林的唯物史觀社會學，不是近階段的好讀物，書中錯誤甚多，有機會時再爲指出，現在特介紹唯辯證法物論敎程（李達譯，筆耕堂出版）代替布著。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c187">兒童和環境 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 湯崑</p>
<p>誰個不能加以一個不字，說兒童是一塊白玉，這塊白玉必定要經過雕刻才成一樣寳器；但是做這雕刻白玉的人是誰？當然是兒童最親近的父母了。同時一個兒童的環境，亦是那個兒童的父母可能改良；或促成其罪惡。兒童是一意照着環境而去追求他的生活的，所以改良兒童的環境。就是改良兒童的生活。同時兒童現在的生活，就是造成將來人格的基礎，所以做父母的，對於兒童環境應該有十二分的注意；而尤宜注意兒童個性的愛好，予以實際的帮助其發展；同時對於不良的思想，予以一種敎導，憑着一種技術去糾正他。但是應該去除那種恐嚇的手發，因爲恐嚇的手段，祇給兒童思想上的變化；而不能改正其思想上的错誤。</p>
<p>盧梭在他敎育名著愛彌兒上說：「不要責罰兒，不要使兒童來謝罪；因爲兒童還不曉得道德上的惡，所以打他罰他，都是不應當的。」這句話是多少足以使我們作爲訓導兒童的聖經。事實上，兒童對於一件事情，他着手去做，他根本没有去顧慮到這件事的應該做與不應該做；所以對於兒童做錯的事，在兒童看起來，並不負有良心上的罪惡。倘使做父母的全憑着自已一種主觀的態度，一種已經飽經故世人情的眼光，來責罰，還不見天地的兒童，當然是不會奏效。這樣的責罰兒童，兒童祇記住你恐嚇他的一種印象，對於自己做錯的事，當然他仍然不會去反悔；而且事實上，也没有容許他反悔的機會。所以做父母的，對於自己兒童的错誤，應該取一種善意的訓導。換言之，就是利用兒童自己的環境·使其發現自己以前的錯誤，受着一種良心的譴責，這種譴責促成他去改正以前的誤錯。</p>
<p>所以兒童的一塊白玉，這雕刻的責任者是全憑着做父母的一種善良環境的誘導：與敎誨，而極力應該避免一個父母者，自己意志的發洩；而同兒童站在同一地位上謀着改進。</p>
<h3 id="c188">巴城湖上 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>輪船從崑山到常熟，經過第一個碼頭，便是巴城：巴城有個湖，便呌巴城湖。</p>
<p>湖的面積，並不那麽寛大。湖　澄清可愛；輕波微蕩漾，好像春日和風，吹動了淺草一樣。</p>
<p>湖南上點綴着幾隻船，擱起了櫓，帆墻高掛；淺灘上面，亂枝蓬勃。臨風搖曳。湖的那面，黑烟起處，一艘輪船由遠而近，漸漸地浪花飛濺到我們的船上來；於是「烏朶朶！」雙方打起招呼來，特别衝破了湖面上單調的沉寂。</p>
<p>極目天際，綠樹銜接成一大弧形。樹枝稀疎的地方，一二竹籬茅舍，隱隱透露出一灣屋角來：縷縷吹烟，若斷若續地蜿蜒上升。</p>
<p>已經破了産的農村，當然够不上「要人」們車駕的流連；可是農村固有的活靜沉穆丨丨現在也許說不上「怡然自樂」，恐怖也非鷄蟲得失的「要人」們所能領悟於萬一的罷！</p>
<p>略舉我所曉得的，洋澄湖以産蟹而得名；西子湖因有蘇堤春曉，三潭印月等名勝，得以以才子佳人的擊節嘆賞；惟此巴城湖局居鄉隅，没世而名不聞。同此一泓清水，可以蕩滌胸襟，而遭遇不同如此，難道亦有幸不幸存乎其中嗎？</p>

<p>趙自强看到他那情形，也就跟着歎了一口氣道：爲人莫當兵，當兵莫結婚。田青笑道：結婚呢！自强道：瞎！結婚是活糟心。連部有七八個人坐着呢，聽了這話，全哈哈大笑起來。田青笑道：你爲什麽發這樣大的牢騷，難道你那個美媳婦兒，你還有什麽不稱的嗎？趙自强道：就爲的是媳婦不錯，才說活糟心的。你想，新取的美媳婦兒，誰不願意多温存幾天？可是我還没有和他把害羞的樣子取消，你瞧，這裏一個電報，就把我提了回來了。這樣一來，我倒没有什麽，可是人家作新媳婦兒的，把丈夫的臉子，還不曾看得清楚，就和丈夫分别了，心裏不難受嗎？田青笑道：老趙，你别說屈心話。你的新媳婦兒，果然，没有把你的臉子看清楚嗎？趙自强笑道：就算是把我臉子看清楚了，也不若滿意吧？你想，人生一世的大事，總要從從容容過着才好。可是我們不到七天，把這一件事就完結了，誰不難過呢？唉……田青走向前，拍着他的肩膀道：事情已經過去了，他難受也就難受定了，發上這一陣子牢騷，又有什麽用？你來了這久，也該去見見營長了，我想也一定還有話和你說呢。自强想着，這倒是正理，站起來，將衣服襟擺牽得直了，於是就向營部裏走去。他營長寳芳，正背了兩隻手，昻着頭看半空的天色，忽然回頭，看見了趙自强，早就笑了。自强行着舉手禮，走了過去。寳芳握住了他的右手，拍着他的左肩，笑道：你實在是服從命令的，電報打去，人就來了，新娘子好？（三二九）</p>
<h3 id="c190">杭州藝專展覽會一瞥 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>禮拜天！作什麽消遣？</p>
<p>游山罷！偌大的上海，四望不見一個丘陵。玩水罷，黄浦之水冷且濁，不堪濯吾足。電影院，擠滿了昏悶的人頭；運動塲去，我又没有球·</p>
<p>「逛馬路」！去賞覽那些眞實地「活動電影」</p>
<p>走到環龍路中法友誼會門口，驀地抬頭，看到「國立杭州藝專美術展覽會」的標揭；呀！這是「藝術之宫」，是「藝術的運動塲」！我是藝術的門外漢，今天也不妨權充個升堂入室的人吧。衆人同裏面跑，我也向裏面跑。衆人簽名，我也簽名。衆人看畫，我也學著鄉下人看告示的方法鑒賞那縱横陳列的一切作品。</p>
<p>情人眼裏出西施，我在這百美横陳中欣賞了孫福熙的菊，徐正之的犬，李超士的大娃娃，白石山翁的水禽，林風眠的國畫小品，臘染的雀梅，各式工業實用的設計圖案，各種姿態的人體寫生。……</p>
<p>全會所陳作品，凡分國畫，油畫，水彩，圖案，粉畫，雕塑，攝影諸門。圖案畫中分染織，陶磁，漆器，廣告，室内裝飾，建築裝飾諸類。出品的藝人計藝專敎授十九人，學生二百餘人·全部作品凡五百六十二件。參觀的人著實不少。藝術的運動，例以西方，則我國尙屬萌芽時代。一校作品的展覽如此，將來擴展而爲全國藝人的集團運動，不難蔚爲大觀。</p>
<p>若是有人說我在這裏替畫展會做「義務廣告」，我也値得介紹他去當個「免費看客」！</p>
<h3 id="c191">三等車廂中 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>

<p>蹊磔……蹊磔……</p>
<p>車，已在金華站停得不耐煩了。鵝絨般的雪，還是一片一片的打從車窗外飛下，邊旁一個「龍頭」的巨眼，放射出極强烈的光芒，映照在玻璃窗上點點滴滴的水珠上丨那由雪花融化而成的水珠上，泛出閃閃爍爍的螢光，不料雪夜行車，會有這麽一幅更富有詩意的圖畫展示在眼前。</p>
<p>查票員到三等車廂裏來了，靠門的一個座位的旅客，從「背心」的袋裏掏出一張什麽字條。查票員接過去，只從鼻孔中擠出了聲「吼」，接着，便一把將他抓起向門口推……他只有一身刨烟匠猶嫌髒的外衫和「背心」，此外，便只看到他的一副骷髏似的鬼臉。他是一個窮得可以，而且病得可以的可憐蟲，我在這樣猜想着：</p>
<p>「鞋子掉了，讓我……」他在向查票員哀求，一壁命令着自己的脚從地板上摸索他的鞋子；同時，他還用着乞憐和羨慕的眼光向我們瞥視，似乎說，你們眞幸福哩！我怎麽便不能乘坐？</p>
<p>嗚……嗚……嗚……</p>
<p>汽笛鳴過了，一會兒，車又在銀也似的茫茫大地上前進了，格隆格隆地。　　「護照不行，没有長官的姓名。」一個小白臉的憲兵向「Ｔ師同志」這樣嚴重地提出否認。邊旁一個由攀談而和他熟識的「Ｙ師同志」，站起來給他帮助懇求那憲兵；</p>
<p>「同志！帮帮忙吧！他已經五個月没得餉了呢！」</p>
<p>「不行！跟我到車務處去！」</p>
<p>憲兵前行，「Ｔ師同志」懶洋洋地在屁股跟。</p>
<p>「他要檢查你的身邊有没有錢。吼！要你補票！没有，也可以馬馬虎虎的」　　「Ｙ師同志」很機警地這樣低聲告訴他，他便趕忙地掏出四隻洋遞給他的「同志」去了。</p>
<p>蹊磔……蹊磔……嗚……嗚……</p>
<p>車靠站了。好睡的旅客給嘈雜的聲音從夢中驚醒，睡涎像長絲般的由口角裏漏出，滴在胸襟上，袖子邊。</p>
<p>站頭不大，大約十分鐘吧！車輪又在格隆格隆地轉動了，「Ｔ師同志」領着憲兵回到言兒來，「Ｙ師同志」不見了。他呌晦氣，眞的，他在第二站給憲兵推下車了。雪，依然在不住地飛揚。</p>

<p>— 碧波</p>
<p>在驕陽偪射着的田塍裏，老福根兀是仰着頭，企盼上天的甘霖早些下降，以潤活許多枯槁將死的禾苗；可是他天天的希冀，却終於失望！</p>
<p>他没有錢租洋水龍戽水，不得已冒着酷暑，徒步趕到十里外的一個小鎭落上，和一家向有往來的米店裏借錢；結果又是遭了拒絶！</p>
<p>他兩種悲切的回想交攻着，更兼感受了些暑邪，忽地在歸程的半路上，發起急痧來了；幸虧被他的隣人瞧見，護持他回到家裏，他又是一個新近喪妻的人，祇有一個伶俐的女兒丨小妹丨和一個才祇　齡的孩子，瞧了這們情狀，都慌了主意。</p>
<p>在上海的大户人家丨金公館丨做帮傭，而爲鄉村裏衆人羡幕伊能够挣錢的丨鄒四嫂丨恰巧在那時回來，忙將所備的痧藥水，冲給他喝下去，果然漸漸地好了。</p>
<p>經過一畨攀談之後，四嫂居然將水龍租費無條件借給福根，並且允准到上海時，帶小妹去一同工作。</p>
<p>都市裏享樂人們的典型，當然不是初出茅廬的小妹，所能夢想得到的；但是福根却因爲秋收雖豐，米價狂賤的緣故，而不能還清所負的債額，没有法想，只得寫信給小妹；可是小妹呢，却給丨金家二少爺丨視爲目的物了，但是正愁没有下手的法兒，乘這個機會，竟要挾小妹出賣了伊的貞潔。</p>
<p>少爺們看中一個使女，原不値什麽一回事，可是小妹還痴心地，眞的想主人履行娶伊的一句諾言，因爲伊已有了身孕。</p>
<p>過了不多時，那曾經蹂躪過鄉間少女的二少爺，又和一位所謂閨秀的訂婚了；那時小妹却被老爺太太將伊軟騙硬嚇，只索含着眼涙，回到田間去。</p>
<p>老福根是一個很要面子的人，那時見了女兒，知道了底藴，便一氣成病，不久就死了；小妹也在這悲慟時期裏，産生了一個玉雪可愛的孩子。</p>
<p>風氣閉塞的鄉村裏，看不慣這等，都將小妹養了私生子作爲話材，到處喧傳着，一種鄙薄不堪的諷剌，比毒箭還難受；同時金家持了貴族骨血不能遺留在外邊的大道理，着了家丁和四嫂，對小妹利誘威迫的，將伊恃爲唯一生命線的孩子，攫奪了去。</p>
<p>小妹在無可申訴的悲哀過程裏，便帶了伊弟弟到上海，找伊的寃家丨二少爺丨却巧在大門前的汽車裏碰見了，他非但不認帳，並且聲色俱厲的，叱着閽人，將伊　開去，在這不可開交的時候，伊的弟弟，偶然在馬路裏看野景，竟被另一汽車撞倒了；小姝這個時候，哀痛澈骨，反而哭不出來，只是悵望着金公館的鐵門發怔。</p>

<h3 id="c225">說自殺 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 吳必嚴</p>
<p>「太好的果子多半是最先爛掉了的」！太優秀的青年多不能成器，太聰明的孩子很難養成人丨丨大概根據人事經騐是的確的。</p>
<p>近代有許多青年自殺。原因呢？或經濟壓迫，或戀愛失敗，或看破紅塵……方式呢？遺書數封，或服毒，或投江，或臥鐵軌……結果呢？或遇救，或眞死掉了！</p>
<p>故意逼死的人不算，爲了自願而互的，良可哀！廣泛地看去，有生者未必樂死，則仍是環境逼死的居多，也許大半還是故意的。許多舊人物徒然因爲看不慣或覺得碍路，不惜業新青年加以致命的創傷。七八年來消滅了許多二十歲以下的青年，便是明證。更何况在北京政府門首還曾有女學生喋血。那麽這些責任自有擔負者，從來「寃有頭，債有主」，如果逼死了人，說不定在自己或自己的兒孫身上得着果報的。因果從來不誣，猶其於生死之情，可信。</p>
<p>剩下的自殺的原因則不多了。蘭以明自燒，膏以明自消，棲棲皇皇，不遑寗處，終之以一不了了之，如王國維，則其故是失之「太眞」，將人生看的太眞切！或則一蹶或屢蹶之後，萬慮俱灰，所寄托的精神先亡，則視殘存之軀殻爲不足惜，視死如歸，其故則失之「太脆」，如艾霞，不能禁風雨，猶如嫩弱的春花，許多春花似的孩子，是這麽萎頓了的。</p>
<p>悠悠人海中，生死之情，緣緣相續，幾個青年的自殺也眞如九牛之亡一毛。但對於整個的社會的前途，却顯然是一種徵兆，這顯示中國青年與世界已共其休戚，亦抱有時代病而痛苦，徬徨。雖爲頽唐，但已是力的表現，正如女人中着「糊壁紙的毒」，必有苦痛而有將來的産生，雖然這時代的趨勢與將來産生的是什麽，我們現在一點也不知道。</p>
<h3 id="c226">何家槐的創作問題 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>前天在本刋上看到何家槐君的「關於我的創作」一文，文章寫得很好；不過其所供事實，還待討論。何君所提的清道夫的文章，是登在最近的「文化列車」上；清道夫確實另有其人，我雖知道但在此不便宣佈，如到必要時或竟成法律問題時，當有人負責。清道夫是我的友人的化名，但他所發的消息，最初是從我的口裏聽去的，所以這事我就不能不負責。現在並非是爲清道夫辯解，而是事到如今不得不將我所知的事實公開了。</p>
<p>我與何君素不相識，無怨無仇可知，與何君作對之心，更絲毫都没有，現在非自己出頭不可者，也是萬不得已。</p>
<p>我最初聽到何君創作可疑的話，是去年夏天在南京後湖某一個晚上，說話的人是儲安平（何徐二君雙方的朋友）；聽話的人除我之外尙有高植；安平是這樣講的：「何家槐和徐轉蓬的小說，不清不楚，原稿有時寫着徐轉蓬的名字，但發表地雜誌上却改成何家槐。」他當時並舉出篇名爲例，可惜我忘記了。因爲是說閒話，所以並不怎樣注意，而且當時我與轉蓬還没有見過面，事情就過去了。</p>
<p>其後和轉蓬相處日熟，偶然談到進件事，最初轉蓬否認，但從他的答話的表情裏，可以看出他是在作假，一加追問，他也中得承認了。本來完全是因爲好奇心開玩笑才探問的事，旣經證明確是事實，心裏不知怎樣却感到非常的不舒適，不但對何君不滿，卽對於轉蓬也是非常不快的，因爲在上海文壇的醜事雖多，但如這樣的却還少見。</p>
<p>「一共有多少篇呢？」我問轉蓬。</p>
<p>「大概有十篇左右吧，可以說是我一九三二年的全部的作品吧。」轉蓬回答。</p>
<p>這更可證明，罪過不完全在何君一人的身上，如是一兩篇文章，碍於友人的情面，還情有可原，若果有十篇之多，那就太不像話了。當時我毫不客氣地責駡了轉蓬，而且請他以後像這類的事再也不要求。（不過轉蓬却另有一番解說，叙述原委，因未經轉蓬許可，現在不便披露。）</p>
<p>「那麽這事安平怎樣曉得的呢？」我問。</p>
<p>「這事當不止安平一個人曉得：」轉蓬說。「恐怕沈從文，施蟄存和邵洵美都曉得的，因爲我有一篇文章先拿給從文修改，改了很多，而發表出來則變了何家槐的名字；辄有先投給「現代」和「新月」的文章，寫着是我的名字，而旣經拿回來在另外雜誌上發表，又變了名。」</p>
<p>但轉蓬的猜想是錯誤了的，因爲編輯先生們並不能那麽地注意，當我得便問蟄存的時候，他說並不曉得。</p>
<p>我不能不負責任，這消息是被我無意中講出去的，清道夫的文章也就從此而來。</p>
<p>在我，毫無結寃於何君之心，而且何君尙是一個新作家，如果像煞有介事地宣佈出來，恐於何君不利，所以我曾對轉蓬說，請他們暗中了清此事，物歸原主，以後也就不會再有人說話了。轉蓬被朋友們慫恿得也頗想把文章收回來了，但他終於面皮熱，不肯直接和何君交涉，只說慢慢地想辦法。最近他回鄉去了，寫了一封信給我，指出杜衡，蟄存，邨人及我四個人代他辦清這件事，而且說他那方面，就由我「全權作主」，這眞是一個難題，請想，這種義務律師怎樣作法！</p>
<p>同着邨人跑到現代書局和杜衡及蟄存談了一下，商議的結果是，在現代書局正印刷中的何君創作集「雨天」暫時停止出版，請轉蓬親自寫信到現代，開明其中他自己的作品，抽出了事。可是此議决案通知轉蓬後，至今已有半月，仍不見他的信來，大概此公又在猶預了。然則我這個「全權作主」的義務律師，若將原告也都失落，自己倒成了法律中人，那官司可怎樣打法呢？現在何君自己又出頭要人，連累上一個清道夫，我便不能不將事之原委供之如上了。</p>
<p>至於何君「關於我的創作」一文中解釋他的創作的話，我看有點兒吹牛；其所謂（一）布民局緊嚴（二）描寫細膩（三）用字造句非常愼重諸特點，倒是對於轉蓬的小說的非常適當的批評，他自己可完全都没有的。何君也未免太厚臉皮，自己認爲滿意的傑作之中，如「車水」如「出獄」明明白白就是轉蓬之作，難道這還要請出批評家們出頭來研究和分析麽？好在轉蓬的創作，都存有原稿，到必要時，或可製版印出。</p>
<p>但我們總希望何君能勇於認過，將物送歸原主，而更從此努力，或者前途尙有無限之希望；否則只顧眼前，任意詭辯，事情因此宣揚出去，則蔣更爲人所不齒了。</p>

<p>關於墓誌銘一類的應酬文章，我已屢言及矣。近讀喬鉢一文，諷刺墓誌，言極幽默。其意謂：「爲人作墓誌銘，不塡事蹟，則求者不甘；多塡事蹟，則見者不信。其至無可稱述，不得已轉抄彚語，及衆家刻本以應之。辟如傳神寫照，向死人面上脫稿，已不足肖，况寫路人形貌乎？吾願世人生前行些好事，做個好人，勿令作誌銘者，執筆躊躇，代爲遮蓋也。」爲着墓誌光榮而作人，此種諷刺，眞可謂想入非非。</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>今之作者，多作創作經騐，其間佳者，殊不多觀，大都自捧自讚，且有以爲人請作此類文章爲榮，爲出風頭好機會者，我實不敢讚一詞。徐日久云：「弟猶憶二十年前，困苦至極，死活不得，終日作文，終日煩惱，又終日不住。文成不敢示人，卽示人面隨發赤，以爲遭輕薄者不可耐也，遭讚歎者，亦不可耐也，或不幸而遭舖張談說之士，尤不可耐也。乃今天下之言文者，初不内量其力之所能爲，外度其人之所可愛，欺心造業，稱引前輩，而按其實地，墮鬼國尙不自知，亦可憫矣。」像這樣坦白的精神，憤慨的指摘，在我們作家的自述中，眞不知已有幾見，雖說也有其人。</p>

<p>有人名黄黄鶴，周百安很幽默的打趣他說：「黄鶴樓以仙人搯橘皮成鶴，起舞而名。黄鶴峯以峯下多松花，鶴背俱黄而名。先生是橘皮成耶，抑松花撲耶？二者居一，總太清空。但恐空餓殺欲上鶴背先生耳。」語殊有奇趣。</p>

<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>跨進房裏，妻無聲的望着我，像有什　　讚　　，而一時又說不出來似的。</p>
<p>我不覺也沉默着了。</p>
<p>半晌，妻低下頭去，然後又抬起頭來望着我？：</p>
<p>「你的東西收拾清楚了？」</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>「可還有什麽要的嗎？」</p>
<p>「没有了。」</p>
<p>我慢吞吞的回答，看妻的那面孔：異常的悲苦！她坐在床沿上，黑溜溜的兩隻眼睛，老是依依不捨的儘望着我。這使我也感到離别的痛苦了！</p>
<p>我低了頭，想說句什麽話安慰她。然而，一句也說不出！房裏沉寂得丨有點凄凉。</p>
<p>過了一會，妻哽着聲問我：「你明天去後，那日才能回來呢？……」</p>
<p>「隨時都好回來。」我抑住心裏的悲哀，像往日一樣的和妻開玩笑。</p>
<p>妻勉强苦笑了一笑：</p>
<p>「當眞那日回來？你在外邊不想想我如何難過！你倒忍心呀！」</p>
<p>我故意的調侃妻：</p>
<p>「我出門去帮人家……要受人家的氣，挨人家的駡，這才難過哩！你在家裏有什麽難過的？」</p>
<p>妻苦着臉，長長的嘆了一口氣：</p>
<p>「我的苦，那個曉得？……唉，我本不喜歡再同你常常分開，但有什麽法？你出門去後，我一個人孤零零，要管家又要忙菜地裏的活計，你想想……！」「那末，我不出門去了，我陪你在家裏丨好不好？」</p>
<p>「不好，你要出門去！」妻瞅了我一眼：「不過，你不要再像往年一樣的，打着濫賬回家來。丨丨家裏還欠着人家的債，我也還差着三姐一石榖子錢哩！」</p>
<p>聽了妻的話，我無言的對着那盞半明不滅的殘燈，心裏只是在想：我怎麽才不會打着濫賬回家來呢？</p>
<p>在我的不注意中，妻却偷偷地流出眼涙來了！</p>

<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>前綫上雖然有十幾萬將軍統率的大兵，可是都成了驚弓之鳥，没有一點連絡，交通的命脈已完全停斷了·前綫是空虚的，前綫只有幾十萬的肉製的子彈。</p>
<p>於是，城裏的汽車，馬車，人力車，排子車，水車，牛車……連人和駱駝，在一夜的功夫都被徵發光了，讓他們載上大餅，乾饅頭，砲彈，槍彈……一齊向前綫進發·這長長的一條由平民由馬車水車和駱駝組成的輜重隊，從高空上向下鳥瞰，也許和那北方的萬里長城漸漸凑成了一個「丁」字的形勢罷。那丁字上邊的一筆，是千百年前用人民的脂膏和屍骨壘了起來的，如今，丁字下邊一筆，又是驅使着萬千的生靈去堆積了。侵略的强暴者在什麽時候絶跡或永也不絶跡的事我們是不大知道，但這條姑無論用什麽東西壘砌了的萬里長城，却永久成了我們這個民族歷史裏的一頁悲壯慷慨的記錄。它也許有一日會被那侵略的强暴者從這越來越萎靡的弱小者手裏奪了過去，但那城上的一磚一石，曾經沾染了浸透了我們先們的血汗和精靈的，他的光榮將永遠地在這個世界上閃爍着。</p>
<p>平民和駱駝的輜重隊，出發了的第一日看到土房和枯樹，第二日看到倒壞了的房屋和燒焦了的樹木，第三日看到了死了的騾馬和人屍，在路上，舖着冬天遺留到現在還没有融化的白皚皚的氷雪，並且還攙着仿彿才流出來不久的人的殷紅的血丨已經是凍成一片一片的了……　　蜿蜒的長城就在目前了，在那邊，白天是罩着漆黑黑的烟，夜晚是昇騰着鮮血般的火焰。　　敵人的飛機，像山鳥似的一羣一羣的盤旋在天邊，一會兒高，一會兒低，一會兒近，一會兒遠，那聲音是極度震耳的，隨着機聲，就落下無數的黑點，黑點到了地上，一人個一個都是二百多磅重的炸彈。轟動的聲音，爆裂的聲音，壙野上成了他的播音塲，山谷裏作成一個很凖確的回聲機。</p>
<p>衣服片，石頭片，肉片……立刻迸飛起來，又化成了無數無數的小黑點。這黑點的來，那黑點的去。所謂戰之正義與敬禮，不過就是在這凄慘慘的空間留首一瞬的幻景罷了。</p>
<p>無數無數的小黑點仍舊回返到地上來，於是在地上便開着人們用腦漿用血液塗紅了塗白了的花。</p>
<p>平民和駱駝組成的輜重隊，不久就被那些成羣的「山鳥」驚散了。到處跑，到處踏着了冰雪，踏着了人血。饅頭，大餅，砲彈和槍彈都沿途地擯棄了。壕溝裏面的戰士，仍舊是空空地托着槍，渴了去捧一把血染了的雪；餓了去肯一塊巳經凍成了冰塊的乾糧。</p>
<p>我們的戰士凍餒在雪裏，在血裏。期待着什麽呢？上官的命令：祗許防守不許進攻，那麽等罷，成羣的山鳥又來「下蛋」了，他們就飽餐了這些東西，死在雪裏，死在血裏。</p>
<p>幾十萬大兵活活地做着敵機的犧牲；無數的百姓成了災黎。山林，池沼，城廓……不久的期間都全盤地異色了！</p>
<p>我們在夢裏翹盼着的中國飛機，有一天黎明果然在空中軋軋地飛起了。全城的人們都鼓舞而歡悅了，介只是不久的功夫又復沉寂下去。</p>
<p>將軍已經乘着他的自備飛機出亡了。</p>
<p>從那個時期過後，除了保衞界裏是格外的繁榮之外·其餘的地方差不多都罩住了死一般的沉寂。沉寂了一個多月，現在可是又到處繁榮了，繁榮的程度幾乎是無法統計的……</p>

<p>紗市農疲午漲、但實需依然滯鈍、故人心極疲、逢漲抛賣者尙多、惟美棉情形仍昻、商塲上傳說紛纭、謂日廠二十支鴻禧紗連稅售價祗一百七十元外、因此空方心意較濃、據一部份調查、天津帮昨購日紗三千件、但價格未詳、</p>

<p>棉市平靜、但形勢尙軟、以紗布交易不暢、美棉雖穩、而印棉趨跌、致人心不振、買户缺乏、現棉銷路停頓、各廠進胃尤滯、報載英國紗廠以銷路衰落、一百十五廠有停止工作之說、於此賣氣較濃、棉市就大勢而論、恐無大跌風、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一角左右、坎拿大小四分不等、故開價後、各月份市氣、均見平平、賣買亦見清淡、因此市價與前日相仿、迨至下午開盤、各月份開價頓轉好面、傳大廠家方面、因存粉關係、有一部分停車之說、同時又傳阿根庭麥報價見升、近開四元二角半、故本月份卽見步步堤高、遠期因廠碼不出、亦稍帶起、後步如客銷果佳、近期尙有續好之勢也、結果本月份較前日好一分半、四月份好一分半、五月份好一分二厘半、六月份好一分半、七八月份好一分、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈穩定之勢、惟各月份交易、仍甚清淡、本月份祇下午做開幾車、價因廠家拉住、雖數日未開、較週初好起近角、遠期各月份、交易亦不暢、價無出入、查麥市情形、在陳貨檔口、出入恐不甚大、必須新麥有把握之時、方能熱鬧也、現麥交易、亦呈清寂、祇開山東麥二百包、價三元五角云、</p>

<p>全日開出一萬一千包</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因有路貨到申、貨主求脫、市上中次居多、售意尤活、上午開市後中關以下各擋一律步小五六分、高貨亦稍帶平、繼有本街略爲問訊、泉州福州以市價下落、到市採辦、惟閩省目下市價並未上漲、且有各路直接裝去、故胃口雖活、吃價甚緊、全市開出湘贛各米一萬一千零三十包、其中由寗波去漢口糙米九百包、本街去湖南機砶靖八百五十包、糙紅五百多包、江西機晚及機元四百多包、其餘盡爲閩省泉州福州辦去、福州胃口較香、計去五千包、泉州去二千三四百包、市面疲而復活、仍與前市相似、行情則高貨迄無更動、中次扯平三四分云、</p>

<p>— 齊速</p>
<p>一隻巨大的桶，立在現制度上，是十分堅固而又找不出一個細小的漏洞的。有着圓肚皮的人們，每天從桶裏取出二大碗水；但同時傾入了五碗，這樣桶漸漸地滿了。許多水在桶裏站不住脚，被擠出桶外，在桶的四週呼喊着，攀援着，這有人名之曰：「生産過剩」的現象，被擠出來的，便是「失業」之羣了。　　這種人越來越多了。社會上充塞着這些敗類，像秋天的落葉似的，呌人没處安排哩！還有許多人，出世太晚，當他急急地從「娘肚皮」裏鑽出來時，這社會早已塞住了。於是他没有機會享到人的生活，在惡環境中生長成人，没有敎育，没有仁慈，更無所謂人格；他們不知道什麽呌思想，呌高尙，呌害物，只知度眼前快樂而已，反正努力是如此，胡調也是如此，胡調也是如此的。</p>
<p>這種人在上海多得怕人呢！每一條街，每一條衖，都有他們的足跡，都是他們尋找暫時底酣醇的場所，「釘梢」，「打架」，「敲竹槓」，是他們的生活，「觸那」是他們不可少的語彚，「身體不是租來的，打相打不要學的」，是他們的人生觀，「只要狠，就有便宜佔」，是他們的哲學。他們終日昏昏，　六月裏的蒼蠅似的，滿坑滿谷地飛舞着。</p>
<p>這病狀漸漸地影響到學校裏去了。學生們，膽大的，怒視着他們！這些蒼蠅丨懦怯的，徊避着他們，還有些投機的呢？投機的爲了各方面的便利，便與他們合流了。畢竟投機的多啊！學生也吊膀了。學生流氓化了。這不是近年來，最可怕而普遍的現象嗎？</p>
<p>於是紳士們慨嘆了。學者們煩噪了。在神氣的講臺上，在精美的會客室裏，在華貴的宴席上，振臂奮呼着：「這太不興了！這太不興了」！這樣下去，國焉得不弱，列强安得不着着進佔呢？他們以爲這皆是國人太不注重精神的訓練，太不注重道德的修養的緣故。喲！提倡精神救國！哟！神聖的精神呀！刻苦，耐勞，仁慈，愽愛，忍耐，前進，向上，勇敢，樸素，廉潔，不苟，……</p>
<p>可是安適慣了的紳士學者們，不要被一些好聽的名字迷住子吧！要是精神眞能救國的話，我們這個培養了幾千年精神的古國，决不致於會到這一地步的；什麽是精神？炸彈，飛機，大砲，這才是揭去了面幕的現社會底眞精神呢！「人家打你的左耳光，便把右面的耳光再送上去」。這眞能感人嗎？那是很久很久以前的事了。假使牠有屍骨的話，屍骨早變了礦物，礦物也早用去了。</p>
<p>高貴的先生們！你們有了銳利的指甲，還應該有尖昨的目光呀！看到事情的地下去掘了出根來，聽到事情的背後去，找出究竟來。</p>
<p>那些突起了肚皮的人們，在取出二碗而傾入五碗呢！</p>

<p>— 逸鷺</p>
<p>關於睡覺，咱家曾記得有一位科學家，用歸納法證明睡覺的重要。</p>
<p>他的證明就是每一個人每天夜上都得要睡覺。</p>
<p>這位科學家又說：「睡覺的時間在人們一生的壽命中至少要占到三分之一。」此外，他更開導咱們：睡覺時候，對於時間上，温度上，姿勢上應該怎樣怎樣注意，如何如何當心，不致阻碍康健，而有益身體。</p>
<p>當時咱家聽了這位科學家的一席話，眞似勝讀十年書，把咱家佩服得五體投地，極想投一張門生帖子拜他爲老師，在睡覺的科學上下點工夫，以求深造。怎奈咱家是個秉性散漫的傻子，生平最怕人管，而科學又是一件管人最拿手好戲的東西，假使咱家拜了他爲師，不把所學的孜孜研究，變了個似驉非驉，似馬非馬的「四不像」，豈不有汗老師顔面？</p>
<p>「各人自掃門前雪，休管他家瓦上霜；」只要自己認爲是適合自己的脾胃，還是吾行吾素的好。於是在睡覺的時候，咱家仍是比常人多睡一二個鐘點。仍是比常人多蓋一條半條被，仍是蒙着頭向左侧着或朝天平躺着睡丨丨一切一切仍是像從前那麽睡，至於那位科學家的話，由右耳朶進去，早走左耳朶出去了。從此後，對於睡覺的科學，再也不去想牠一想。如此下來，忽忽又兩載於茲矣。</p>
<p>綜計這樣睡，睡，一直到現在，已睡了二十四個三百六十五夜了。在這二十四個三百六十五夜中，咱家領略了好</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>些睡覺的美慰。覺得睡覺也該算是一種藝術。至於藝術，好像聽得過這麽一句話：「卽使人的一舉一動，凡自己認爲是不平凡而能充實自吾的生命的，在某一點上看來，也未始不可說是一種藝術。」……這裏忽被一位生理學家忿怒道：「根本不懂藝術，却要談藝術，非解藝術；照你這樣說來，那麽拉屎，鳥尿，放屁都得稱爲藝術了嗎？豈有此理！豈有此理！」這位先生眞好管閒事，咱家自寫咱家的東西，偏要他來嚕囌：「把睡覺是藝術的理由說來！」咱家應曰：「豈敢？豈敢？請息怒，容小生俱道其詳：」</p>
<p>「靜安寺路，福煦路，或戈登路，西摩路，愚園路等等的大小洋房内，幽淡的電燈光隔着雪白的紗帘從窗裏透映着渾渾深冬的天色時，室内鋼琴裏震蕩出旣莊重又幽揚的（一）（二）（三）（四）（五）聲，以及無綫電收音機中的搖搖寳貝睡覺，隱隱約約地，一陣陣地傳到路上行人的耳裏。閣下若是個有心人，那不妨踏着沉遲的脚步，在這幾條路旁躑躅着，拿出一支紙烟，擦根洋火，一面再慢慢地吸着想着。想想那些洋房裏的主人翁們在幹什麽體會體會他們的味兒怎樣，那眞會呌你越想越要想，想到含在嘴邊的紙烟將燙着嘴辱兒還不知道，這才够你神魂眞倒的哩！你看，看見嗎？現在你的眼前不是好像有一間華麗而精美的臥室顯現着嗎？看，四周淺黄色石膏粉飾的牆壁上掛的銀色鏡框中，不都是洋女人的畫兒嗎？地上鋪的不是又厚又軟的地毯？花盆架上供的不正在開放着的臘梅嗎？滿房間的傢具陳飾多够舒適好看？還有，房中央地！站着正燒得通紅的不是電暖爐，是什麽？牀頭前小几上正在唱着的，是無綫電收音機啊！看見嗎？一位滿面春風的中年男子不正坐在牀中，兩條腿已伸進被窩裏，上半身穿着羊毛睡衣靠在牀背上嗎？一隻手正拿了本什麽書看着，在另一隻手的兩指間正隔着一支雪茄。收音機仍舊唱着，唱着。這男子聚精會神地傾聽着，一時眼皮閉上這麽一閉，一時拿起雪茄抽上那麽一口。突然地，牀顚動了一下，被窩裏探出一個人頭來丨丨一個女人的頭，喲！先還没有看見，裏牀被窩裏還睡着個麗人呢。這多够消魂啊！（未完）</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>在現代社會上，差不多一切都成了商品化了！藝術，文學，當然也是換飯吃的東西，總脫不了商品化的競賣；現甚在甚至連人格也有人在拍賣咧！</p>
<p>最近有一位女作家：爲了「要認識社會」，而去作「新生活的嘗試」（是她自已說的），所以就不惜犧牲的跑進ＸＸＸ跳舞廳裏去充當舞女。吾想像這位女作家；至少是偉大的，勇幹的。她自己旣然聲明：「這是感到人生的没有意味，而去嘗試這種新的生活」···那是無疑的，她並非是爲經濟，爲生活而到這裏來。但是吾以爲；當舞女無論如何總是一種職業，並不是高尙的職業，是一種給人家摟之抱之；以美色，以笑靨，以···愽取金錢的職業。那些爲環境壓迫，爲生活驅策的舞女們；吾們已應該同情她們，可憐她們了。因爲。她們是在惡魔的爪牙下掙扎！也許在她們迎人的笑她裏會滴出熱涙來。要不然，誰眞願意來幹這種出賣靈魂，出賣肉體，供人玩弄的夜生活呢？這是爲了錢，是金錢呌她們來幹的，她們也這麽地想，這是墮落的勾當，這是非人的生活。想做個小姐，奶奶，甚至是太太，坐汽車，住洋房，多樂。但是，命運支配了她們的現實。</p>
<p>現在這位女作家；居然大胆地去嘗試那等於出賣肉體的舞女生活，她的唯一志願是「要認識社會」。誠然，現社會的畸形複雜，誰都不能加以否認的，不過要想認識社會，必須要深切地了解現社會的情形，組織，作一度詳細的觀察。要像探險家一樣，跑進峻岠險要的深山叢林裏去實地體騐。那末，吾自然也同希望探險家的出發一樣，希望這位女作家得到偉大的收穫回來。可是，可憐得很，她嘗試的僅是舞女生活，要是她肯更進一步，嘗試到對上中下社會接近尤多的生活時，吾相信，她對於社會的認識纔是眞的徹底了。</p>
<p>不過，吾對於她，總覺得有些懷疑？他假使乾脆的說一聲，爲生活，爲經濟，那吾們當然不該去非難她，而且還要同情她。因爲舞女究竟是一種職業，職業本來是不分貴賤的，並没有階級的。時今她偏要說是「作新生活的嘗試」，而且爲了「要認識社會」。但，吾以爲這樣，不免有些投機性質！她如果眞的爲「要想認識社會」，那末，吾要勸她作·····這裏要比較舞女容易接近社會，並且容易體騐到社會的黑暗面和光明面的一切，人羣，生活。</p>
<p>作家這名頭多麽的響亮。有了一個作家的頭銜，便似一登龍門身價十倍起來。然而，有時候也有些人在去賣作家，出賣作家的人格！</p>

<p>— 子</p>
<p>蓉從北平來信，第一句話就說雄前月在北海自殺了。原因是這樣的在信箋上寫着：</p>
<p>這，我們不僅爲雄悲哀，我們更應當爲他憤慨！他對於社會，雖然還没有任何的貢獻，但他已立志要獻身了；可是社會對於他，只是慘酷的無情！　　這還是去年暑假的時候，他從大學裏畢業出來，他一點没有以爲自己戴了方帽子而增高了身價爲榮，他只是竊自幸喜自己在求學上告了一個段落，今後正可爲社會上類服務了。那時，他眞是燃燒着生命的火燄，熱烈烈地在人生的旅途上大踏地前進着，但是，在這個社會裏，他没有知道他自己是没有闊親戚的窮小子，那裏是他的地位？那裏有事給他幹？於是他從北平跑到天津，從天津到上海，在上海曾住了兩個月，後來他告訴我，他忘了你住的地方，因此他就一直没有可能來看你·我想這就是他的致命傷了，因爲他能找到你的話，你多少總能帮助他，而不致讓他在寛敞平滑的馬路上白跑兩個月的。在他的遺書裏，據說那時他還没有灰心，他仍然雄心勃勃地要創造一座理想中事業的金山；他這次自戕的因子是種在離上海而到廣州，不得要領的從廣州到南昌；在南昌仍是毫無成就，於是他開始對人生咒詛了，他便没有主宰地聽了一個不相干的同鄉的慫恿，最後，他流到他的故鄉，故鄉，破産崩潰了的故鄉，豈是他事業的金山的所在地？當然這無非是徒然减少他做人的勇氣而已。月初，忽然他跑來此地見我，他說他的事都解决了，當時我以爲眞的他找到了職業，我還熱烈地慶賀着他呢，豈知他是以死來解决他的問題的。在他的遺書裏，他說「横直北平是製造我成遊民的地方，我便死在北平好了，」他還解釋說，「假使我放棄挣扎這最後的四年，我相信社會不會這樣的遺棄我的，」這該是何等悲憤沉痛啊！……</p>
<p>我颤抖着高擎信箋默然地讀着，腦經裏便幻出一個活潑快樂的青年的臉像來。他的那樣結實高大的個兒，懇摯熱烈的性情，尤其是在他濃眉之下深凹着的那一對烏黑銳利的大眸子，更是流露出絶大的智慧來。平素。他總是以古老的中華民族敎育不够爲憂，并且立志要把振興的大任放在自己肩上，所以他雖窮，他要進學校讀書，每學期的開學他拚命向朋友們東挪西凑，四年以來，他是如此挣扎，然而他總是快樂達觀，因爲在他的理想中，眞存在着一個「事業的金山」，並且，這在他也是自信很深的。</p>
<p>雄是死了，當然我要爲他悲哀，而且和蓉一樣對這個社會表示憤慨！但是，雄自己遺書裏的話，究竟也是有理由的，「假使我放棄掙扎這最後四年……」這該是何等深刻沉痛啊！</p>
<p>這裏，我們對現有的傳統敎育有了一個認識：學校好比一只鳥籠，一只精緻的美麗的鳥籠，裏面雖然給鳥的主人佈置着假山假石，并且還有珍貴的美味的食品，然而鳥的學生們終竟是和大自然裏眞的山眞的石相隔着，牠們的思想路線，終竟是在這精緻美麗的籠中對假山假石打着圈子。一旦離籠而復返大自然的時候，無疑地是感着茫然，甚至連飛的本能都不會了！我們知道這鳥籠該是如何殘酷罪惡啊！然而折毁這鳥籠，還須鳥自己去幹的。</p>

<p>— 靈鎭</p>
<p>在航空影片中的戰鬥塲面，多半都是用兩架飛機或是多架飛機拍攝的。那坐演員的飛機上面安置着機關槍，令演員坐在裏面飛駛上去後，演員便開始做戲，好像他那機關槍放出去的子彈都打在敵人的飛機上。這時在他的左面及右面都有飛機隨着他，這左面及右面的飛機内，坐着導演及攝影師，他們在那裏拍攝演員的表演。當他們雙方面都把那演員的戲攝入鏡頭後，便與那演員是不在一個時間内演的戲一樣，這是因爲攝影機地位安置的不同，所以他們拍出來的戲也就不同了。然後把那幾個不同地位的戲分别的採捨應用，便能成爲許多的塲面。這是省事的一個方法，不過那放機關槍的戲，决不能對着鏡頭拍攝他的正面，因爲若是機關槍口對凖了鏡頭放，戲不但拍不成，而且攝影師的性命都要送掉呢。</p>
<p>我們還可以看見那飛機好像是對着我們的眼前飛過來，將要到身邊又向上一飛而過去了，這也是非常難攝的戲，攝製這個塲面時，是一架飛機上安置攝影機，往另一架飛機上拍攝，那被拍攝的飛機往這安置攝影機的飛機直飛過來，將要相撞時，那被拍的飛機飛過那安置攝影機的飛機，在影片上拍出，我們看着便成了飛機直向我們飛來在將要到身邊而忽往上飛去。</p>
<p>當演員們拍攝航空的戲時，他若略有不適就不能免强飛到天空上去。免强着支持演戲，在地上還到可以，但飛上天去就不行了。有病的演員飛上天去便能使　的病更加重，所以在拍攝航空電影之先，每個職員與演員却要非常的健康，　不至有意外發生。</p>
<p>有一些航空影片中驚險的塲面，是用複攝影的方法製成，在我們眼中看着像　天空中發生了很驚險的事，但是在拍攝的時候到不一定是很危險的，因爲有　塲面是在外面拍好了外景，然後再回到公司的玻璃棚下再拍，用複印的方法　　得一點馬脚也露不出來，你看着還以爲安全是在天空上拍的一樣呢。　　又有一些是用模型來拍的。這與平常影片中用模型拍攝是一樣的，若攝影師在對　及搖動影機的時間運動的得當，你一定也看不出是用模型假造的呢。　　拍航空片的光綫很要緊，雖然他完全是用日光，但攝影師一定要把光綫運用得好，才能增加劇的力量。</p>
<p>航空影片的剪接也非常的要緊。若是一部航空影片剪接的好，能使你看到很多緊張的塲面給你一個强有力的刺戟。否則那用了很多的心血，金錢，又經過很大的困難，危險拍成的驚險塲面，會使你看着一點也不覺得驚險的。所以航空影片不但要注意攝影術而且剪接的工作也要特别的注意纔行。</p>
<p>航空影片的攝製，並不是一件容易的事，較比拍攝普通的影片，是要難的多呢。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c280">評「雙宿雙飛」 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＩLivedWithYou</p>
<p>丨蘭心光陸丨</p>
<p>我想這種故事也不是完全没有意義的，當那個流浪着的皇太子賣了受賜於尼古拉皇帝的錶上的兩粒鑽石之後，使這一家人從此衝突不安。父親偷了那賣價之半數，母親將他視爲上賓而誇耀於鄰里。姊姊愛上了他，而妹妹亦想將他奪爲己有。爲的是他曾經是一個光榮的皇太子，而有那珍貴的錶上之鑽石。</p>
<p>在這裏可證明劇作者洛伐羅的確是有人情世故的經騐者。他不僅是以寳石來增加幸福之家庭中的糾紛，他甚至於使他們失却了理智。這些，都是非常現實的現象，姑無論是否只有一個被放逐的皇太子才能做到。當然，在後面劇作者發揮了他自己的理想；他不使這皇太子再破壞這家庭幸福，敎他毅然離開這家庭。然而又爲了使人們同情皇太子的仁厚，到底使那熱烈受着他的格黛絲跟着上去，說是爲了戀愛跟着他去過清苦的生活。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，我們可看出劇作者全部的意識形態。也許洛伐羅編劇完全是爲了自己的主演，所以在好些塲合他都盡可能的使自己使展。特别是關於主角和格黛絲之間戀愛的起伏，更寫得淋漓盡致。於是他便如此取材，在理想中構思了一個没落的皇太子。在風流潇洒，舍己爲人的特殊個性中，使他自己在主演的時候能够極力發揮。</p>
<p>但是任何素材，當我們採取的時候，必定是通過自己的思維而加以選擇。那末洛伐羅將舊俄皇室的人物來作自己的替身，而且還極力同情他；這决不是偶然的，而充分的是他自己的意識形態。也許有人說，他在劇中並没有明顯的侮辱俄國現政府的地方，卽在對白中亦不曾對革命何等咒咀。然而這與其說是站在第三者的地位不牽涉政治，母寗說他不能，也是不敢如此。何况他要觀衆同情皇室的命運，雖然是感傷的也罷，這已經給人們不良印象了。</p>
<p>上面說過，洛伐羅完全是爲了自己而編劇，所以關於他的表演的確是値得稱讚。他能够沉着做戲，固不待言，而那種細膩的表演，更爲可取。在他的表演中，我們可看出他有着充分的修養，細微的一舉一動，也流露着豐富的感情</p>
<p>然而，一點也不過分的說，這一影片所値得稱讚之處，也便是他的表演。此外那個飾母親的亦演得極佳，當她在菜市塲中炫耀於鄰居之前的時候，當她受着一時的打擊便立刻大聲痛哭的時候，我們可看出對於戲中人之深切的理解。再則飾格黛絲亦很好。飾菲力斯夫人堂妹妹的，更給與我們嚴肅的印象。</p>
<p>自然，這一作品假使我們認爲並不失敗，那末導演者自有相當的功績，關於這一方的檢討，除了在開始介紹那幾個人的身份和職業的時候，還不够經濟之外，其他各塲面，都很精粹。自然，那女廚司身上的噱頭，證明了英國片將與美國片趨於一流，不過這也是調和沉悶之最好的方法；譬如說好幾次兩人坐在一道便是長長的談話，非此不足以調劑。然而像皇子不洗澡的而做成在洗澡之聲音的時候，這旣可以描寫皇子之懒怠，也是非常有趣味的塲合。</p>
<p>此外，没有什麽可說了。這是一連的英國喜劇中少有的悲喜，雖然它並没有何等價値。</p>

<p>Using the Lack of Meteorological Stations on the Islands as a Pretext</p>
<p>Academia Sinica Asks Government to Build Them Quickly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After France occupied the nine small islands, French newspapers are again advocating occupying the Xisha Islands, arguing that the islands are a necessary route for summer and autumn typhoons to attack Annam, but there are no meteorological stations there, so there is no advance warning and no preparation can be made. It was discovered that at the Far Eastern Meteorological Directors Conference held in Hong Kong in 1920, a resolution was passed requesting that we quickly establish a meteorological station on the island. Our representative agreed to submit it to the Naval Department of the government and drafted a complete construction plan, but it was abandoned due to lack of funds. Now, the Meteorological Observatory of the Academia Sinica has presented it to the Executive Yuan Naval Department, requesting that the case be investigated and expedited to prevent the French from using it as an excuse.

A portion of the representatives will leave Nanjing for Mongolia this Thursday or Sunday, and the rest will remain in Nanjing to receive various items. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Baotai and other Mongolian petitioners scheduled to return to Mongolia on the morning of the 8th to report on their mission, leaving only three or four people in Nanjing to handle everything. As the date of departure has been set, Zhao and others invited the representatives stationed in Nanjing to hold a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss everything. It was heard that it was decided that the success of this Mongolian autonomy depended entirely on the efforts of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek. In order to commemorate this, it is planned to donate money to the Mongolian people in their capacity as Mongolian citizens to inscribe a stone for Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, and to publish the telegrams supporting autonomy, and to cast a bronze statue to pass on for eternity.

<p>British Foreign Ministry Admits It Was Accidental</p>
<p>Will Stop the Actions of the Burma Company</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Burma Company, carrying armed guards, invaded the Ban Hong area of Yunnan Province to mine gold. The Foreign Ministry ordered Xu Ruijun, the Consul in Rangoon, to negotiate with the British side, but to no avail. Our Envoy to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, lodged a protest with the British government. The British government has responded to Guo's protest, explaining its position. The Foreign Ministry has formally notified the British Envoy to China, based on the facts, expressing our country's attitude. It is said that the note has been sent. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British people are excavating gold mines in Ban Hong. The Foreign Ministry, according to the findings of Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, and Wang Zhanqi, the Yunnan Diplomatic Inspector, telegraphed to Guo Taiqi, the Envoy to the United Kingdom, to negotiate with the British government. The British side has been very protective. Later, they instructed Guo Taiqi to lodge a protest with the British government. It is now known that the Foreign Ministry formally protested to the British Embassy yesterday. The content is more specific and has been delivered to the British Embassy. After Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen assumes office, negotiations can begin. According to a certain Yunnan person, Ban Hong and Ban Nong, which are under the jurisdiction of Lancang County in Yunnan, have famous gold and silver mines. On December 19 of last year, Britain sent more than 20 troops stationed in Burma to invade our Lancang territory and seize the mines in the area. Since the Ban Hong incident occurred, it has been almost two months. Britain has indeed been mining the gold and silver resources in the area. The British troops include infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers. When I was in Burma, I heard that the British government ordered the collection of dozens of giant elephants to transport machinery to Ban Hong. This machinery is purely for mining. On the day the British army arrived in Ban Hong, the young king of Ban Hong came with them from Rangoon, the capital of Burma. The Ban Hong area is a nest of savages, because they are ferocious, difficult to tame, fierce, and murderous, and few Han Chinese go to their area. The young king of Ban Hong was previously at odds with his brother and fled to Rangoon, the capital of Burma. The British treated him with great respect, built a Western-style house for him, and provided him with everything he needed for clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, and ordered him to attend school and further his English studies. Therefore, although the young king of Ban Hong was previously a savage chieftain with no knowledge, his level of knowledge is now comparable to that of a high school graduate in the country. This time, the British occupied Ban Hong and used him as a puppet to guide them. It is found that Ban Hong is a shortcut to Burma. If you go directly, you will arrive at Liexu in two days, take a train for two days, and arrive in Rangoon. This is compared to the ten days it takes from Yisong, the seat of Lancang County, to Rangoon, and the ten days from Yisong to Ban Hong, the convenience of transportation is much different. Furthermore, it is found that the British use evangelism as a name, and the Yong family and his son preside over the ministry. In recent years, there has been considerable progress. In total, there are about 40,000 (Guo Hei) who have entered their church, according to Wen Sheng. Their ministry is divided into two parts: the ( ) part is based on (Meng Meng), and the (Guo Hei) part is based on (Nuo Fo). The church buildings in both places are clean and majestic. Those who enter them are no different from living in concessions. The Bibles they use are all spelled with English letters, and the Guo language is taught. Yong Ran has more than 300 Saras (Guo language, i.e., teacher) under him, who run around for him, calculating their merits and increasing their salaries. Every Sara, if they can recruit several or even several villages of (Guo Hei) people into the church each year, their salaries will be increased according to their performance. Yang Yongwen, Sheng Yongwen, Le's brothers, and Saras are very enthusiastic about the ( ), Guo, and Yi languages. Currently, there are many of their church members in the Mengjiao and Mengjia areas near Ban Hong. It is heard that they are quite involved in the Ban Hong incident this time. Furthermore, it is learned that the British army is building barracks, 20 or 30, between Ban Nong and Ban Hong. A Han traitor, Ma Meiting (a Christian), is inciting the border people to act as internal agents. It is also heard that Yang Yiqian, the second colonial commissioner, is paying close attention to the above events and has ordered Shi Derong, the magistrate of Lancang County, to be responsible for the investigation, and sent Feng Kunju, who is familiar with the border situation, to inspect and collect evidence in order to prepare for future negotiations. Yang Du Ban himself inspected the counties along the border on February 16 to appease the ethnic groups along the border, unite them, and strive for sovereignty. What happened later is unknown because I left the province. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Negotiations Underway to Reduce Cotton and Wheat Loans</p>
<p>Coinage Revolution Case Not Yet Investigated</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. Song went to his private residence to rest, and Kong went to the Ministry of Finance to work and summoned the directors of various departments for discussion. He attended the Executive Yuan meeting at 9:00 AM. According to a certain senior official of the Ministry of Finance, (1) regarding the issue of the ratification of the Silver Agreement, although there are opponents on all sides, this is a government-wide issue, not just a matter for one ministry. How to deal with it should be decided by the central government. Minister Kong is not in a position to express his personal opinion. As for the issue of rising silver prices, although it is related to the Silver Agreement, it can still be handled separately. Since this falls within the scope of finance, Minister Kong has discussed concrete measures to deal with it, but he cannot announce them to the outside world before the time is ripe. (2) The Yellow River water conservancy issue is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people in North China. This time, the breach in the lower reaches has caused particularly severe disasters in Shandong and Hebei. Blocking the breach and providing relief is an urgent matter, but relief funds are quite difficult. The Yellow River Disaster Relief Conference has discussed the funding issue. Some propose that the additional tax on the Hai River be transferred to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Fund. The Ministry of Finance believes that this is still difficult. Minister Kong has proposed a concrete plan for governing the Yellow River and will submit it to the Executive Yuan for discussion. After it is passed, the Yellow River Disaster Relief issue can be resolved. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi said, (1) We are negotiating with the United States to reduce the American cotton and wheat loans. The amount of the reduction has not yet been determined. As for whether the United States will agree or not, there is no such thing, because this is not an ordinary buying and selling transaction. It depends on the extent of China's needs. (2) The Coinage Revolution case has not yet been formally investigated, because this matter is of great importance and must be studied in detail. (3) As for the convening of a regular meeting of the Economic Commission, it will depend on whether it is necessary after I meet with Secretary-General Qin. It is difficult to determine the date of the meeting at this time. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At approximately 1:00 AM on the 6th, freight train No. 118 on the Beining Railway, traveling from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan, reached wooden bridge No. 105 near Tangshan. Due to years of decay and rot, the bridge collapsed as the train passed over it. Three coal cars fell into the river, injuring three workers severely and five others slightly. Fortunately, the bridge was low, preventing the cars from being crushed. A rescue train was dispatched from Tangshan at noon to transport the workers and construct a temporary pontoon bridge for traffic. The submerged cars are being salvaged. All trains are delayed. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At approximately 10:00 AM on the 6th, a coal train of seven cars, traveling from the west to Tangshan, reached iron bridge No. 406 at Xu Ming Zhuang, about fourteen li west of Tangshan. Due to disrepair and damaged sleepers, the bridge suddenly collapsed, and three coal cars fell into the river. The remaining cars derailed, injuring five people, including the train guard and the driver of the guard car, slightly, and one person severely. They were immediately sent to Tangshan Hospital for treatment. A temporary railway section was quickly erected and completed by 5:00 PM, restoring traffic.

<p>Death Toll Expected to Exceed 500</p>
<p>Over 350 Bodies Already Recovered</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) On Sunday night, the Si Hai, a gasoline-powered motorboat on the Pearl River, sank. The death toll is feared to exceed 500. According to authorities, the boat's capacity was only 136 people, but it was carrying over 600 passengers. The cause of the sinking was not, as initially reported, a collision with a reef, but due to excessive overloading. Hospitals are now handling the examination of bodies and caring for survivors. The scene outside the hospitals is unbearable. Over 350 bodies were lined up in the streets when this report was filed, and more continue to arrive for identification. Dozens of women are kneeling and weeping in great sorrow among the corpses, searching for their relatives without success. Carpenters are working day and night to make coffins. Although there were women on board, no female bodies have been recovered so far. It is feared that they were trapped in the cabins and went down with the ship. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Si Hai electric boat, which runs between Guangzhou and Xinhui, had an accident at Datongkou on the 4th. The shipowner, fearing the consequences, hid the incident and did not report it, claiming only 30 to 40 were injured or killed. Initially, no one paid much attention, but after investigation, it was found that all 352 passengers on board drowned, with fewer than 10 survivors. Now, the families of the deceased, in addition to handling the aftermath, have decided to ask the court to severely punish the shipowner. Various city organizations are also lending their support. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although there were many female passengers on board the Si Hai motorboat involved in the Pearl River incident, only 25 female bodies have been recovered so far. Two hundred hospital staff are assisting in identifying and registering the bodies and arranging burials. It is reported that the county magistrate of Guangning County was also among the victims. Various organizations and newspapers in the area express deep sorrow over the tragedy and demand that the authorities investigate thoroughly and severely punish those responsible.

<h3 id="e22">Frugality to Save the Poor - Shu <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>丨丨From the German Frugality Movement to Chinese Philanthropy丨丨</p>
<p>The German National Socialist Party recently proposed a religious-like ritual called "Fasting Day," aiming to popularize it nationwide. The money saved from this is intended to relieve the unemployed poor. Whether its effect will be as expected is worth studying. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, it has not yet had a concrete plan for the entire German economic problem. However, the number of unemployed has indeed decreased to more than 3.2 million in the past year. This cannot be said to not be the achievement of the efforts of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Germany is restricted by surrounding countries. Its development in Europe inevitably clashes with the Treaty of Versailles. Even if it wants to develop overseas markets, the world powers have already defined the scope, which is not allowed to be easily touched. In recent years, the international economic struggle has intensified. After the tariff war, it was followed by the currency war, and another strategic economic alliance movement will also advance from theory to practice. Pre-war Germany competed with Britain with its highly developed industry and commerce, but it still could not succeed in the overseas market, let alone today. For example, the monopoly organization of American industry and financial capital is not weaker than Germany, and its natural endowment and geographical advantage are more than ten times that of Germany. However, it is still trapped in a panic frenzy. All methods can only be struggled with. Then the difficulties of Germany can be known without saying it.</p>
<p>Today, Germany uses frugality to help the poor as a temporary emergency solution. It is certainly not impossible. Germans are accustomed to years of struggle. How can they not know that this method is not the end? However, it is limited by the environment. It cannot engage in armed warfare to open up a way out, nor can it obtain foreign markets by peaceful means. Then its internal frugality movement should have considerable significance. However, it is unreliable to rely on this alone to seek a long-term solution. For example, the passive disaster relief and poverty relief methods have been implemented in China for a long time. Not only are there many charitable organizations, but there are also many people who depend on alms for their livelihood. For example, in Beiping, about 300,000 people receive porridge at porridge factories every winter. This is a special reflection of the hardship of the people's livelihood in China. However, this kind of relief is not a fundamental method. It is not enough to help the poor, let alone solve the current predicament. Passive relief measures are difficult to support in the long term, and the heart of compassion can only be triggered occasionally. If it is so long-term, there will be more people who do not work for nothing. It is better to sit and wait for food than to work hard. The rebellions in China have always been due to the failure to solve the problem of people's livelihood adequately. Even the government, known as virtuous and capable, only has ideals and no actual facilities on the issue of people's livelihood. Therefore, the theory of the cycle of governance and chaos has not been thoroughly broken so far. We, in view of the past history, silently observe the current situation, can we not be fearful and think about the fundamental way to remedy it? What is the way to remedy it? The first is to abolish all kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes as declared by the central government, and cultivate the vitality of the people. The second rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. We must actively promote the revival movement. The Rural Relief Committee has decided on four plans, including agricultural finance, agricultural technology, grain regulation and water conservancy, as efforts. We should express the government's determination and sincerity with factual achievements. Third, the frugality movement previously promoted by He Yingqin should be practiced by senior officials and promoted throughout the country. Fourth, we should use scientific and technological development to develop various production undertakings so that the unemployed and people with unstable lives can find a place to live and work.</p>

Although Arima claims that this return to Japan is for private affairs, it is believed to be a major mission. It is believed that after Arima returns to Japan, he will discuss foreign policy towards China with Foreign Minister Hirota.

<p>(Nanjing) The Yellow River Conservancy Association plans to hold its second committee meeting in Jinan on the 20th of this month to discuss the second flood prevention issue and will borrow British Boxer Indemnity funds to start preliminary projects. The committee members have prepared to attend and will be able to hold the meeting as scheduled. Regarding the allocation of British Boxer Indemnity funds, the association believes that the Yellow River control project cannot be completed according to the original plan. The original plan was to start construction after the surveying project was completed, but it did not know that the Yellow River was a disaster and its changes were inconsistent. Even with precise surveying, the situation will change soon. And the main reason for the Yellow River disaster is that too much sand has accumulated in the Hetao area. It is proposed to allocate funds to carry out important projects first. The amount of Boxer Indemnity to be borrowed this time is 400,000 yuan, which is intended to be used for release projects. After several negotiations between the association and the British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors, a proper method has been found. It is currently under review by the Board of Directors and will be completed soon. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese propaganda claimed that the Polish envoy to Japan, Mr. Moscicki, intended to visit Manchuria, representing his government's recognition of "Manchukuo." However, the Polish Embassy in Tokyo denied this, stating it was a misrepresentation. The embassy's secretary, Mr. De Norpinski, visited the Foreign Ministry at 5 p.m. yesterday, meeting with Information Bureau Director Mr. Amau to explain that the Polish envoy's visit to "Manchuria" was to inspect Polish expatriates in Harbin and had no other purpose. He left at 5:30 p.m. (6th, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(London) Today, in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Simon was questioned about Pu Yi's upcoming visit to Tokyo. The question was raised by Labour MP Mr. Smith, who requested that the Foreign Secretary instruct the British Ambassador to Japan not to attend any banquets or ceremonies held to receive Pu Yi during his visit. Simon replied that he was unaware of Pu Yi's planned visit to Japan, and the Foreign Office had not received any such report. Simon also stated that the obligations of all nations that adhere to the resolution passed in Geneva on February 24, 1933, not to recognize "Manchukuo," are well-known. Should Pu Yi visit Japan, the actions of all nations should be governed by these obligations. Labour's Mr. Attlee then pressed for a more definitive statement from the Foreign Secretary, but Simon repeated his previous remarks, calling it a hypothetical question. Conservative MP Mr. Somerville then requested the government to pay attention to the repeated instances of Japanese merchants infringing on British trademarks and counterfeiting British goods. Mr. Burgin, speaking on behalf of the President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Runciman, replied that the British Ambassador to Japan had been instructed to negotiate further with the Japanese government to prevent such unfair competition.

<h3 id="e36">British Navy Overhaul <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Budget Increased by £2.98 Million</p>
<p>Singapore Naval Base Construction Continues</p>
<p>(London) The British naval budget, announced today, totals £56,550,000, an increase of £2,980,000 compared to last year. According to the Admiralty's explanation, £1,427,000 is for the ordinary construction of new warships, and £1 million was carried over from the 1931 shipbuilding program as it was not fully completed that year. The budget includes the cost of building four new cruisers, eight destroyers, one destroyer flotilla leader, one aircraft carrier, and three submarines. Naval personnel number 92,338, an increase of 2,038. The cost of naval air force equipment increased by £249,000, and naval maintenance costs increased by £1,103,000, as several capital ships require extensive repairs and renovations to extend their lifespan. First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell's memorandum stated that, under the London Naval Treaty, Britain is limited in adding or replacing aging cruisers and submarines before 1939. HMS Barham has been modernized, HMS Ramillies is undergoing major repairs, and HMS Malaya will also be renovated. Aircraft launching equipment is under development. New turrets have been installed on twenty-one battleships and cruisers. The Singapore naval base, previously estimated at £7,750,000, has been expanded to £8,693,000. Successful experiments have been conducted on boilers and equipment to reduce weight and volume, and kerosene is being tested on small oil-electric ships. The development of high-speed compressors and combustion engines is also being tested. It was also stated that the 1932 program, which included four cruisers, has been revised to build two larger cruisers. Due to treaty limitations, the fourth cruiser has been discontinued but retains its original status. The First Lord's memorandum also mentioned patrolling against piracy in Dapeng Bay. Notable increases in the naval budget include £249,000 for anti-aircraft equipment for the fleet, £249,000 for repairs and maintenance, £264,000 for special materials, and £1,771,000 for contract work. To achieve the most economical results, construction of the Singapore naval base continues to maintain its effectiveness, so this and future budgets will include this expenditure. (6th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Borah Opposes Additional Warship Construction</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Army budget was submitted to the House of Representatives today, requesting $279,541,000 for 130,750 army personnel. The budget falls short of the Chief of Staff's recommendation. According to the Chief of Staff, the United States should have a standing army of 165,000 men and a national guard of 210,000 men. Meanwhile, the House Military Affairs Subcommittee questioned whether the $93 million allocated for military use by the Public Works Administration and the $22 million for civil engineering projects will be used for projects that are absolutely necessary from a national defense standpoint. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Appropriations Committee and military authorities disagree because Chief of Staff General MacArthur proposed increasing the US regular army from 130,000 to 165,000 men and the National Guard from 190,000 to 210,000 men. This proposal was rejected by the Appropriations Committee. Furthermore, the government requested $349,523,000 for military expenditures for the next year, but the Appropriations Committee only approved $279,541,000. From the public works budget, $7,500,000 was allocated to purchase aircraft and $22,591,000 for aviation expenses. The number of new aircraft requested by military authorities was originally 348, but the Appropriations Committee reduced this to 290 due to currency devaluation. The committee attached a stern report to the budget bill, stating, "There are irregularities in the purchase of aircraft, whether planned or manufactured, which have recently been exposed. The Appropriations Committee is aware of this. Not only in aircraft but also in other purchases, there are irregularities." The Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the allocation of funds from public works or civil engineering projects to military expenditures, stating that this method is based on emergency legislation. However, legislative power belongs to Congress, and this special exception should not be prolonged. The Appropriations Committee requested that this power be returned to Congress. The committee report also stated that the use of various supplementary funds has not been seen to greatly benefit national defense. (5th, Havas)</p>

Republican Senator Borah declared during preliminary discussions that US arms manufacturers sell some of the arms they manufacture to a certain Eastern country, and if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, American soldiers will be killed by weapons sold by their own country. He also stated that he "does not believe that arms manufacturers can cause such a war, but when war is about to break out, these insatiable people may not abandon the idea of making profits." Mr. Borah opposed the naval construction bill, saying that the warships currently under construction are sufficient and there is no need to build new ones. (5th, Havas)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to sources at the White House today, President Roosevelt may attempt to reconvene the World Economic Conference. It is learned that American diplomat and international affairs expert Mr. Charles will be President Roosevelt's personal special envoy, visiting European countries to gather opinions on reopening the World Economic Conference, as the President believes now may be the time to resolve the economic struggle. Since the collapse of the World Economic Conference on July 27 last year, the European economic situation has changed greatly. The President believes that all countries will be able to make considerable sacrifices to improve the world economic situation. Observers say that the American President's proposal to reopen the conference may finally bring about a resolution to the American proposal. Mr. Hull, the US representative, requested a preliminary date for the reopening of the conference when attending the London Steering Committee, but it failed due to the joint opposition of European representatives. The World Economic Conference opened in London on June 12 last year. Although the representatives each delivered impressive empty words, the conference broke down on July 27. The focal point of the breakdown was the issue of currency stabilization, as France and the gold standard countries demanded the prompt stabilization of international currency values, while the United States strongly rejected everything, expressing opposition to the devaluation of the dollar. Today, the US government's devaluation plan has been implemented, so it is believed that there will be no similar entanglement in the future, and the resumption of talks may produce beneficial results. The only concrete agreement of the World Economic Conference, apart from the short-lived tariff truce, is the recent popular London Silver Agreement. (5th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) According to today's news, Mr. Charles will depart for England on March 14 on behalf of the Roosevelt administration to investigate the European economic situation. Mr. Charles will spend three months in Europe. He told people today that he has no authority to represent the United States in establishing agreements on currency stability, war debts, or any other issues, but he is free to discuss these issues with European politicians. He knows that Roosevelt wants to know what actions other countries are taking to contribute to the recovery of the world economy. Mr. Charles served as an advisor to Secretary of State Hull during last year's World Economic Conference in London. (5th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Mr. Charles, former US Ambassador to Rome, has recently been appointed as a special advisor by Secretary of State Hull. The following is a brief biography of Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles is 53 years old this year. During the final years of World War I, from 1917 to 1918, he served as the director of the wartime finance group of the Treasury Department. From 1921 to 1924, he served as the Ambassador to Italy. During his tenure, he led the US delegation to the Genoa and Lausanne conferences in 1922. (The Genoa Conference discussed reparations and European economic recovery, and delegations from Germany and Russia also participated. The Lausanne Conference was the second peace treaty with Turkey after World War I, which established the Treaty of Lausanne, demilitarizing the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits and entrusting their management to the League of Nations Straits Committee.) Mr. Charles is a prolific writer, with many books and novels on diplomacy and social issues. His articles are frequently published in American newspapers and magazines. (5th, Havas)</p>

<p>Opportunity to Ease International Boycott of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the rumor that US President Roosevelt will propose reopening the World Economic Conference, the Japan Economic Federation issued the following opinion: An international currency conference is scheduled to be held in Paris on the 7th of this month. Japan originally intended to propose reopening the World Economic Conference at that meeting, but fearing that it would be difficult to obtain the agreement of all countries, it decided not to raise the issue. Now that Roosevelt wants to re-propose this, Japan will gladly participate. To expect concrete results, major countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan must first hold preparatory meetings. Japan must send high-ranking officials to participate in the reopened economic conference. Regarding the global boycott of Japanese goods, Japan will clarify the truth at the conference and request that all countries ease their attitude towards Japan and open up sales channels for Japanese goods.

<p>Britain Believes Currency Stability is Impossible</p>
<p>(London) Several sources in London believe that the current calm in the foreign exchange market is only temporary and will soon be followed by turbulence. Rumors say that the United States will further devalue the dollar, but it is believed that President Roosevelt will reserve this as a last resort, only taking this step if all other plans fail. Furthermore, President Roosevelt must obtain the authority to reduce the dollar's gold content to less than 50 cents before he can depreciate the dollar to 50 cents. The British Exchange Equalization Account's recent efforts to defend the pound have led to rumors that the British authorities have decided to stabilize currency values in fact, but these rumors should not be easily believed, as the situation is currently uncertain and currency stability is impossible. The monthly report of Barclays Bank of Britain stated that although Britain recognizes the benefits of an international monetary standard, it cannot hastily agree to the restoration of the gold standard until the situation is stable, there is a firm grasp of the feasibility of an international monetary standard, and there is sufficient guarantee of the liberalization of trade restrictions, so that debtor countries can sell their goods to fulfill their international debts.

<p>Studies Issues with France</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that the Committee of Imperial Defence met at Downing Street, chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald, with representatives from all the Dominions present. Such meetings are usually kept strictly confidential. The Disarmament Conference has reached its current state, so the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence is of great significance. It was then surprisingly learned that the Cabinet's Disarmament Sub-Committee will convene tomorrow. It is said that although France has not yet formally responded to Britain's disarmament plan, French Foreign Minister Barthou made a statement to the Chamber of Deputies' Foreign Affairs Committee on the 2nd of this month, and its meaning is very clear. Judging from Barthou's statement, it can be seen that the French government's attitude towards Britain's disarmament plan has been determined, so the Sub-Committee must meet to discuss it. When the committee meets, it will listen to Eden's report and his oral explanation. Political figures believe that the Disarmament Sub-Committee may discuss a way to give France some satisfaction in terms of security, in exchange for concessions on armaments. This is only speculation, however, and the majority of people in Britain still do not want Britain to make any new promises to guarantee the security of continental countries. This speculation is somewhat contrary to this view. (5th, Havas)</p>

<p>Goebbels Discusses Unemployment Relief Policies</p>
<p>Can Allow Two Million People to Join the Workforce</p>
<p>Leipzig This year's Leipzig Spring Fair officially opened yesterday afternoon, with a speech by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. He first said that this fair has a long history, having been founded in the twelfth century, and has a close relationship with this famous city. The German government's holding of this product expo in the spring is also a great new policy to relieve unemployment. The details of this new policy will be announced soon. If implemented step by step, it can allow two million people to join the workforce. According to the government's calculations and the needs of the German nation, if the public can each fulfill their duties by purchasing, then supply and demand can correspond. The National Socialist Party government will do its utmost to maintain and encourage the Leipzig Fair, as in the past. This meeting contains the function of popularizing the world, because the participants from all over the world account for eighty-nine out of ten. This conference is not only an opportunity to promote German products in the country, but also to promote them abroad, showing German products one by one to buyers. All the new inventions in it are the results of the German industrialists' efforts. Therefore, the National Socialist Party government recognizes this conference as Germany's leading "international market". Goebbels also said that the revitalization of commerce and the relief of the unemployed in Germany should be attributed to the officials and the people of the whole country.

<p>Roosevelt's Radio Address</p>
<p>A Further Explanation of the Recovery Plan</p>
<p>National Production Needs Reorganization</p>
<p>Controlled Economy Not Contrary to the Constitution</p>
<p>Democracy Has Failed, Implement New System Decisively</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in a radio broadcast address, explained the necessity of reorganizing national production. He stated that from 1919 to 1929, the national economy was like a madman, and no one at that time put forward any plan to avoid the harm of overproduction, nor did anyone seek a way to allow the public to buy things they could not afford. He also said that during these years, the authorities and the people were not invigorated, so that the government's power fell into the hands of some groups, and the purpose of these groups was to seek the self-interest of some classes. As for the economic recovery plan implemented by the current government, its main spirit is to strive for the improvement of the lives of the largest number of people within the greatest possible limit. The method is to increase wages to restore purchasing power, and develop foreign trade to seek a balance between agriculture and industry. In short, under a representative government, the implementation of economic control policies is not contrary to the principles stipulated in the U.S. Constitution. (Fifth, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt addressed the staff of the National Recovery Administration today, advocating that the industrial sector should immediately reduce working hours again, so that the unemployed and those who lost their jobs could obtain work with a living wage. President Roosevelt said that this must be done in order to continue the work of revitalizing the country and restoring equilibrium.</p>
<p>Reorganize Production and Exchange Systems President Roosevelt also said that Americans whose annual income is less than $2,000 purchase two-thirds of the goods sold domestically. Therefore, as the wages earned by these people gradually increase, merchants, employers, and investors will eventually be able to increase their income due to increased sales of goods. A year ago, when the business was in decline, we legally took on the system of reorganizing production and exchange, and now we must make this reorganization lasting.</p>
<p>Strive for an Average of Wealth and Power We must never again allow a social situation in which a large proportion of the people exist in a state incompatible with Americanization, and in which the distribution of wealth and power is uneven. The willingness of all parties to participate in this new undertaking is now more evident than before. For example, I recently received a telegram from the American Bankers Association, representing banks across the country, expressing their trust and sincerity and their willingness to support the efforts to revitalize the country. This is proof of this. The structure of American banks is sound, and the position of each bank now in operation is more stable than ever before. The situation has reached a point of extreme liquidity. Gentlemen, try to recall what position the banks were in a year ago today. You all know it. The telegram from the Bankers Association today is clear proof of progress.</p>
<p>Seek Greater Welfare for the People We should consolidate what we have already gained, and resolve to make what we have consolidated beneficial to continued progress, and especially to the greater welfare of the American people. What the National Recovery Administration seeks is to balance our economic system, to maintain our domestic market so that it is rich and large, and to increase the trade between our country and other countries. The government cannot continue to bear the entire burden of unemployment forever. What should be done at present is to enable more people to obtain work. Wherever industrial autonomy fails, the government must act decisively and quickly to prevent its failure.</p>
<p>Industry Regulations Protect Small Industries The industry regulations authorities are the custodians of our industrialists, especially the custodians of our small industrialists. We must establish all kinds of safeguards to avoid the extinction of small industrialists. All industry regulations must stop the competitive methods that squeeze out small industrialists.</p>
<p>Adopt New Systems and Strive for Revival The situation in March 1933 was extremely serious. Many diseases must be treated simultaneously. The purpose is to use American methods to provide this relief, not to imitate the treatments that other countries have tried. President Roosevelt mentioned that the authorities have now adopted communism and collectivism or have adopted fascism and dictatorial systems, saying that American democratic organs have been ineffective for many years, half due to the leaders and half due to the inertia of the people themselves. President Roosevelt also said that most critics comment on the details and methods of the recovery plan, rather than on the recovery plan itself. This can be regarded as satisfactory. The entire purpose of the Recovery Administration is to increase the purchasing power of the people, a conscious and rational benefit, which no one opposes. However, most people are currently in a state of displacement. When there is a question of humanity first and then interests, we cannot allow hesitation. (Fifth, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rumor That the French Government is Preparing to Support It</p>
<p>(Paris) French banker Dulier, representing the French National Economic Expansion Association, signed a French-Japanese banking syndicate agreement with the Japanese representative last month to participate in investment in "Manchukuo." Recently, according to the Financial and Economic News Agency, it is rumored that the French government is preparing to support the syndicate represented by Dulier in investing in Manchuria, and even the French government will provide moral guarantees for the capital that France will invest in Manchuria in the future. However, the French diplomatic circles do not have this impression, only saying that regarding this matter, it has been seen in the statement of the National Economic Expansion Association. The statement stated that Dulier was sent to Manchuria for private business and was only a commercial investigation. At present, the association has not changed this attitude. Although Dulier has signed an agreement with the Japanese representative, this is a kind of agreement in principle, so that it can be used as the basis for future negotiations, and qualified French companies have not yet participated in this agreement.

<h3 id="e56">Rice Issue: Agricultural and Colonial Ministries Stand in Opposition <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The opposition between Agriculture Minister Goto and Colonial Minister Nagai over the issue of importing rice from the colonies has not been resolved. Goto is supported by domestic landlords and political parties, and his attitude is very strong. The Legislative Bureau's compromise plan is not recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. This morning, Minister of Railways Tsuchi met with Yamamoto, Takahashi, and Saito in the Diet to meet with Nagai and Goto, and persuaded the two ministers to settle the dispute, but the result was not satisfactory. The opinions of both sides are as follows: A. "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Proposal" (1) Clearly stipulate the number of rice grains imported from Taiwan and Korea into the country, and receive special imports into the country from the governments of the two places on a monthly basis. (2) The Korean and Taiwanese governments should purchase surplus rice grains in their localities. (3) If the rice grains purchased by the two governments are to be imported into the country, they should first consult with the Minister of Agriculture and then proceed. (4) The Minister of Agriculture may use the funds from the special accounting of rice grains to purchase the rice grains collected by the two governments. (5) The number of imported rice grains in the third and fourth items cannot exceed the number stipulated in the first item. B. "Ministry of Colonial Affairs Proposal" (1) Do not specially establish a purchasing committee. When using the law to purchase rice grains, the governments of the two colonies must agree with the Minister of Colonial Affairs, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Agriculture on the number of rice grains to be purchased. (2) The funds required for purchasing rice grains are determined by the five-minister conference to be 10 million won in Korea and 50 million yuan in Taiwan. In order to achieve the purpose of purchasing, an additional 50 million yuan will be added. (3) The colonial grain rice import combination proposal advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry cannot agree with treating the colonies unequally for ruling foreign lands. (4) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry advocated raising the tariffs on Manchurian millet to prevent imports from Korea into the country. Because it has been raised by 10% last year, it should not be raised again, and Koreans are living in great difficulty. It is not possible to trample on their lives by preventing Korean rice from entering the country. (Sixth, Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Liu Zhi Talks About the Inspection Tour <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Chairman Liu returned to Bian by special train at 5 p.m. on the 5th with Secretary Peng Jiaquan and others. Party, government, and military dignitaries all welcomed him at the station. After arriving at his residence, Liu told reporters that this inspection tour of Mengjin, Mianchi, and Xin'an counties took a week. The spirit of the civil servants in each county was best in Xin'an, followed by Mian, and the worst in Meng. The team training was best in Xin'an, Mian was inferior to Xin'an, but superior to Meng. The Mengjin militia team has no formal training. The fact that Liu's bandits crossed the Yellow River secretly this time was also largely due to the weak ability of the county's militia team to prevent them from crossing. As for the militia team, if it is organized and trained, and can be united, its self-defense power will be strong, and the bandits can be resisted when they come. Otherwise, even if there are guns, they are only suitable for supporting the bandits. For example, the fall of Luoning to Liu's bandits and the ability of Lushi to defend it all depended on the militia team, whether the leader was the right person or not. Quality is more important than quantity. Now Liu Guitang's bandits fled to the vicinity of Checun in Song County for three days, and on the 4th, they fled from Checun Panxugou to the Nantai border. Commander He Xuchu's troops have rushed forward from Mushi Street in Song to suppress them fiercely. Commander Xue Weiying's troops are tracking and suppressing them. The Nantai side also has Commander Zhang Boying's troops to meet and suppress them. With such a siege on all sides, the extermination of Liu's bandits is imminent.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Communications, the most perfect of state-run enterprises is the postal service, but in recent years, income has not been able to cover expenses, and the losses have been very large, almost on the verge of bankruptcy.

<h3 id="e91">French Newspaper Discusses Inevitability of Russo-Japanese War <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>=Japan relies on military force like a hungry tiger descending from the mountains to devour the fattest prey=</p>
<p>=The Russian government is currently contacting friendly nations in order to strengthen its power=</p>
<p>Paris Correspondence: Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador to Russia, recently left Russia to return to China. When passing through Singapore, he made remarks about the inevitability of the Russo-Japanese War. These remarks have attracted considerable attention from the French public, and most French newspapers have used them as material for commentary. The most prominent example is an essay by Robert Poulaine in a Paris magazine, titled "Is the Russo-Japanese War Possible or Certain?" According to Poulaine's opinion, war between the two countries is unavoidable. The main reason he holds is that Japan is currently in an era of rising military power, and the military has a full ambition to annex Manchuria, which Soviet Russia is an obstacle to. Therefore, it must be eliminated. Currently, Japan's army and navy are truly capable of dominating the world. Although the navy is constrained by the London Naval Treaty, it can still compete with the British Navy. The Japanese Emperor, along with army leaders such as Army Minister Araki, has gained the faith of the public and has already become the dictator of the country. Therefore, Japanese soldiers are almost like hungry tigers descending from the mountains, devouring the fattest prey. According to Poulaine's observations in Manchuria, he felt that the Japanese soldiers' endurance was superior to that of soldiers from other countries. Every day, they carry only a small amount of rice, a fish, and a small amount of tea, and walk forty miles without fatigue. Moreover, they have all received considerable education. Within each regiment of 1,500 soldiers, only 15 are illiterate. If we consider each regiment of French soldiers, the ratio is 30% to 35%. Poulaine then mentioned that in August of last year, the entire populations of Tokyo and Yokohama mobilized to practice aerial defense exercises for three days and nights. During the exercises, 25,000 young men and women raised funds from all walks of life, raising no less than 10 million francs for the government. The enthusiasm of the Japanese public for military affairs and their spirit of sacrifice are commendable. The number of volunteers capable of acting as human torpedoes far exceeds the number conscripted. Once the country is in trouble, these torpedoes can explode at any time. What is even more worrying is that the Japanese population increases by one million every year, and the total population has already reached 60 million. For the sake of feeding its 60 million residents, it has no choice but to occupy Manchuria, because Manchuria has no European countries competing with it for new markets, and at the same time it is a storage place for raw materials needed for its national defense.</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, Japan has deeply understood that there is little hope for a co-existence agreement between Japan and Russia. Therefore, for the sake of national security, it will later occupy the coastal provinces near Vladivostok and the northern part of Sakhalin Island in order to complete its plan to invade Manchuria.</p>
<p>Poulaine's pessimistic views are deeply sympathized with by the Moscow government. The Moscow government really does not want any war to happen, but deeply feels that it will be threatened by Japan sooner or later. The Moscow government is now changing its policy, preparing to sign non-aggression treaties and trade agreements with "intermediate-level" governments, in order to strengthen its strength against Japan, and so on.

<h3 id="e92">Completion of the Lafa-Binjiang Railway Operated by the Japanese (Changchun Correspondence) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>丨Shortening the transportation route between Northern Manchuria and Japan丨</p>
<p>The Dunhua-Tumen line (that is, the disguised form of the Jihui Railway from Dunhua to Tumen) operated by the Japanese was completed in April last year. The Lafa-Binjiang line was again entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company by the Japanese puppet organization and test-run on December 13 last year. The line is 262 kilometers long, starting from Lafa Station on the Jitu Road and ending at Binjiang, the economic center of Northern Manchuria. It crosses the western part of Jilin Province, crosses the Chinese Eastern Railway, and shortens the distance between Binjiang (Harbin), the distribution center for products from Northern Manchuria, and the Japanese mainland. It is also the nerve center of the Northern Manchurian railway network. The distance from Binjiang to Lafa via this road, and then from Lafa to Najin Port in North Korea via the Dunhua-Tumen line, is 207 kilometers shorter than the distance from Harbin south to Dalian. In the past, the shortest route between Northern Manchuria and Japan was 2,020 kilometers from Binjiang to Shimonoseki via the Korean Railway. Now, it is only 1,616 kilometers from Binjiang via the Lafa-Binjiang line to Najin and then to Tsuruga. In other words, the distance from the center of Northern Manchuria to the Japanese mainland is shortened by 396 kilometers with the completion of the Lafa-Binjiang line and the Dunhua-Tumen line. Therefore, the completion of this road has opened a new era in transportation between Northern Manchuria and Japan, and has increased an effective weapon for Japan's military and economic aggression against Manchuria.</p>
<p>Although the total length of the road is only 262 kilometers, there are amazing aspects to its engineering. For example, the Songhua River Railway Bridge at the junction of the road and the Hu-Hai Road is 1.4 kilometers long, which is 31 meters longer than the Chinese Eastern Railway Bridge, which was formerly known as a major project in Northeast China. It is also longer than the Yalu River Bridge. The bridge is a two-story structure, with the upper level for pedestrians and horses, and the lower level for the railway. The construction cost reached 4.2 million yuan. In terms of its scale and form, it can be said to be the first large bridge in the Northeast. In addition, there is a famous Taipingling Tunnel on the road, which is 690 meters long and is also one of the major projects on the line.</p>
<p>The scenery along the line is very different from other railways in the Northeast. The railway meanders along the foothills of the mountains, and the entire line is covered with forests. Therefore, when building the railway, the Japanese specifically cleared 50 meters of land on both sides of the railway, leaving a considerable distance between the trees to serve as natural poles for electric wires. Therefore, today when passing through this place, one only sees small trees of two or three feet, and no longer sees the original forests that were once green and secluded, covering the sky and the sun.</p>
<p>The purpose of the road construction and the purpose of the Japanese to rush to complete it are, on the one hand, to shorten the distance between Northern Manchuria and the Japanese mainland, so as to fully absorb the rich resources of Northern Manchuria. On the other hand, in order to cope with the increasingly tense Russo-Japanese war clouds, Japan is shortening the route for transporting troops, so that troops from the Japanese mainland can quickly reach Northern Manchuria and invade Soviet territory. In addition, the areas along the road were originally areas where our volunteer army hid and emerged. The Japanese rushed to build this road in order to eliminate our volunteer army, which is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Since the completion of the road, the Chinese Eastern Railway, which is also known as the lifeline of transportation in Northern Manchuria, has lost its effectiveness due to the shorter distance to the sea. The cities along the line include Wuchang and Lalin. The number of Japanese and Korean farmers who have migrated here is increasing day by day. The temperature along the line is quite low, often reaching minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius in winter. Therefore, travelers on this road only see the wilderness covered by white snow, merging into one color with the sky.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Chen Jitang Disbands Huang Hechun Brigade <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>=Huang's Brigade was reorganized from the remnants of the 19th Route Army=</p>
<p>=Xu Minghong was arrested in Dapu and executed on the spot=</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The 3,000 remnants of the 19th Route Army and Cai Tingkai's guardsmen were previously concentrated in Longyan and surrendered to Guangdong. At that time, Chen Jitang sent Huang Renhuan, the commander of the 1st Independent Division, to reorganize them into the 3rd Independent Brigade, appointing Huang Hechun as the brigade commander, and transferred the brigade back to Guangdong to be stationed on the border for training. Unexpectedly, Chen Jitang recently ordered the 1st Independent Division to disarm Huang Hechun's brigade. After receiving the order, Huang Renhuan disarmed the three regiments of the brigade. It is said that the reason for the brigade being disarmed is that Chen Jitang was ordered to do so by the central government, and that after the brigade was reorganized, it had other intentions, which were discovered by Chen Jitang, so he disbanded it. As for the officers and soldiers of the brigade, Chen immediately telegraphed Huang Renhuan, ordering him to appropriately accommodate the lower-level cadres and officers. Those who wished to join the army were allowed to be sent back to the province at government expense for training and recruitment. It is said that on that day, more than 500 officers of the brigade volunteered to continue serving in the army and were immediately escorted back to the province by personnel from the 1st Independent Division, temporarily stationed in Yantang, to await training. As for the more than 3,000 scattered soldiers of the 19th Route Army who were transported back to Guangzhou by Shantou ship a few days ago, they are currently awaiting distribution in Huangpu. More than 1,000 people have been selected and taken away by various armies, and more than 2,000 people still need to be trained. The authorities have specially established a new recruit training center in the former officers' club in Huangpu, which was established on March 1, to receive and retrain the more than 2,000 scattered soldiers.</p>
<p>Xu Minghong, the former puppet governor of Longting, who participated in the puppet government of Fujian, was a native of Fengshun, Guangdong, and a member of the Third Party. Last year, he was ordered by the Third Party to carry out activities in Fujian. After the collapse of the puppet government of Fujian, Xu disguised himself and fled. When he arrived in Dapu County, Guangdong Province, he was captured by the defense army and detained at the headquarters of the 1st Independent Division. Huang Renhuan submitted a request to Chen Jitang, who executed Xu on the spot and announced Xu's crimes. (March 2)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Hunan Province Has Surplus Grain and Rice <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>He Jian Asks the Central Government to Increase the Tax on Foreign Rice</p>
<p>And Orders All Provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to Implement It Uniformly</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province is a traditionally rich area for grain production. In the past, millions of dan were shipped to Shanghai and Hankou every year. In recent years, harvests have been abundant, and the Yangtze River Basin has also experienced bumper harvests. Moreover, large quantities of foreign rice have been shipped to China for dumping, resulting in Hunan rice losing its market. Storage is full and prices are low, which not only puts the rural economy in a desperate situation, but also greatly impacts the financial market. According to reports from the grain and rice industry in Changsha City, since the bumper harvest in the 19th year of the Republic, the grain and rice storage in Changsha City alone has been renewed and then renewed again over the years. There are now more than 2 million dan, which can supply the city's population for two or three years. As a result, the existing grain and rice have goods but no market. The best Tianzihao machine rice only sells for 5.30 or 40 yuan per dan, and the best grain only sells for 2.10 or 20 yuan per dan. The banks and grain merchants that store grain have suffered heavy losses. The Grain Merchants Association has specifically requested the provincial government to find ways to provide relief in two aspects: (1) Increase the tax on foreign rice. The provinces of Fujian and Guangdong have not yet implemented it. According to the investigation, Fujian and Guangdong are the largest markets for foreign rice. If the two provinces are excluded, then the so-called increase in the tax on foreign rice is actually equal to zero. Therefore, the rice shipped from Hunan to Guangzhou for sale has resulted in losses. It is requested that the provincial government telegraph the central government to strictly order the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to uniformly implement the tax increase on foreign rice, so as to sell off the excess grain in the interior. (2) The grain reserves in Hunan are too abundant, and both the business community and the rural areas are suffering. It is requested that the provincial government contact various banks to invest in purchases and transport them downstream to revitalize the financial market and regulate the rural economy. He Jian, the chairman of the provincial government, will submit it to the provincial affairs meeting on March 2 for detailed discussion. All department heads and committee members believe that it is necessary to provide active relief. It was decided that: 1. The Department of Finance and the Hunan Provincial Bank will temporarily entrust the original 1 million yuan fund for transporting and selling grain and rice to the Grain and Rice Transportation and Sales Committee to purchase and transport 500,000 dan of grain and rice, part of which will be transported and sold downstream, and part of which will be stored in warehouses for famine relief. In addition, contact the banking community in Changsha to invest in transporting and selling grain and rice. 2. Telegraph the central government and Chairman Chiang to implement an increase in the import tax on foreign rice, and order the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to implement it uniformly. He Jian's telegram to the central government is as follows: To Wang Jingwei, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, and Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry: According to the Changsha Grain and Rice Industry Association's report, the investigation found that the tax on foreign rice has not been implemented in Fujian and Guangdong, and the dumping of foreign rice is becoming more and more serious. Domestic grain and rice have nowhere to sell, and farmers and merchants are suffering. Please forward to the central government to strictly order all provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to implement it uniformly by a certain date, etc. The investigation found that the dumping of foreign rice hinders the sales of domestic grain and rice and has a huge impact. If the import tax is not implemented uniformly, affecting the whole country with one corner, then domestic agricultural products will never have a market, the rural areas will collapse, the business community will wither, and the foundations of the country will be shaken. According to the previous situation, I specially telegraph to request your examination and approval to increase the import tax rate on foreign rice, and quickly order all provinces of Fujian and Guangdong to follow it uniformly, etc. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, respectfully submits.

<h3 id="e95">Recent Developments in Jiangbei Construction <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Director Shen Talks About the Inspection Process丨丨</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department, and Committee Member Yu Bingtang recently went to Jiangbei to inspect the party and government and construction in various counties. Director Shen and others returned to the province yesterday. According to reports, the inspection process is as follows: I have always believed that Jiangsu's construction focuses on Jiangbei, and Jiangbei's construction focuses on water conservancy. Therefore, Director Zhao, Committee Member Yu, and I resolutely embarked on a trip to inspect Jiangbei. We departed on February 22 and returned to the province yesterday, a total of nine days. We visited eleven counties, including Donghai, Guanyun, Ganyu, Shuyang, Lianshui, Siyang, Suqian, Huaiyin, Huaian, and Gaoyou. Although the construction in various counties has not made any special progress due to tight funding, the need to develop water conservancy and build roads has gradually been recognized by the public. The most important findings of this inspection are the following three: The first is the Lianyungang Project. Lianyungang is located at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway, about 20 li east of Xugou in Guanyun County. The terrain is very dangerous, with islands lying across the sea from east to west, forming a natural barrier. The project is sponsored by the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau and undertaken by the Dutch Port Management Company. The original plan was very complete, but due to funding constraints, it was temporarily decided to complete only a part of it. The initial project will be completed within this year. The tide direction is from east to west, so the initial plan was to build a breakwater at the eastern end, which is 1,000 meters long. Currently, 500 meters have been built. Two new-style wharves are being built to the west of the dike, and one-third of them have been completed. The Longhai Railway has been extended from Xugou to Laoyao, with mountain drilling and stone blasting, and the project is extremely large. The Longhai Railway runs across northern Jiangsu, southern Henan, and directly to western Gansu. After the completion of the eastern port project, seagoing vessels with a draft of 6 meters can sail in the port all year round. The convenience of combined water and land transportation is self-evident. The goods from the interior of our country can be imported and exported from here, which is not only related to the development of the Northwest. The second is the development of the Xugou commercial market. After the completion of Lianyungang, commercial development is just around the corner, so the development of the new city of Xugou should not be delayed, so that it can complement each other. The third is the Sixitang River project. Since the provincial government decided to carry out the Sixitang River project, an engineering office was established in Huaiyin in mid-December last year to actively prepare. The levee construction work on various sections has already started one after another. The farmers near the river are very enthusiastic about the work due to their personal interests. Even though they had to stop work for only a few days due to the old customs of the New Year, when I visited the various work sections, the actual labor force in each section totaled nearly 30,000 people. Later, the number of people can gradually increase, the weather can gradually become warmer, and the work will progress more rapidly. The river dams in the sections where excavation is required have been completed and built, and the accumulated water has been completely drained. The tools for excavating sandbags are also well-equipped and arranged. The excavation project can also be started at the same time within a few days. The entire project can be completed as scheduled before May. (April 4)</p>

<p>The Fangjiaxia area of Fenjing Cemetery was formerly a gathering place for reactionaries. The number of honest and good people who have been poisoned by them is countless. Fang Xiuyun of Fangjiaxia once served as the detective chief of the Fenjing Security Regiment. He forcibly borrowed and extorted money in the countryside. After the case was discovered, he was arrested, and the court sentenced him to imprisonment. He appealed to the High Court. Because the victim dared not identify him, he was declared innocent and released. Unexpectedly, after being released and returning to his hometown, he relapsed. Fang cut off the wooden handle of a discarded gun, shortened the barrel, and installed it, making it look like a box cannon. He used this homemade gun to threaten the villagers, such as forcibly borrowing money ranging from 70 to 80 yuan to 20 to 30 yuan, and forcibly taking grain, causing the villagers to be unable to pay rent. There were more than 20 families who were victimized. The victims did not dare to bear grudges because the losses were very small, so they all endured in silence. After the captain of the Water Patrol Team, Fei Gongxia, learned about the matter, he supervised the captain Luo Shutang to go to the countryside and arrest Fang, and seized the fake gun. He has already been taken back to the team headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Cangjie Zhenya Weaving Factory laid off more than 100 workers in order to shut down the hand-weaving department. The workers were unwilling to be laid off and caused trouble to the factory for no reason, resulting in a dispute. The county government convened a mediation meeting again yesterday (the 6th) at 10:00 AM. Representatives from all parties concerned attended. It was decided that the dismissal was decided. As for the issue of severance pay, in addition to the 24 yuan per person paid by the factory, the county government and the county party department will subsidize 6 yuan per person.

<h3 id="e98">Wuxi Rice Industry's Increased Commission Still Difficult to Resolve <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The rice and bean merchants in Wuxi and Wu counties changed the original 99% commission to 98.4%. The Bengbu grain merchants actively opposed the seal and elected representatives Li Peisheng, Sun Yuanfu, Hu Hanqing, and Qian Xiaosheng to come to Wuxi for negotiation the day before yesterday. Lin Yibao, chairman of the Wujin Rice and Bean Industry Association, and Lin Junbao, executive director of the county chamber of commerce, also arrived in Wuxi at the same time and invited Zhao Zixin, Feng Yunxiang, and others from the Wuxi Rice and Bean Industry to have a discussion at the county chamber of commerce. The Bengbu representatives said that the Bengbu merchants have suffered heavy losses due to the sharp drop in grain prices in recent years and are seeking ways to provide relief. However, the sudden increase in the commission by the two counties of Wuxi and Wu makes it even more difficult for grain merchants to maintain. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached, they will have to submit a request to the provincial government to strictly order a halt. On the one hand, they will have to transport soybeans directly to Shanghai for sale. Later, Qian Sunqing, the executive director of the chamber of commerce, earnestly persuaded both parties not to go to extremes and decided that today (the 7th) the chamber of commerce would invite representatives from the Bengbu merchants to visit Taihu Lake in order to negotiate together.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Telephone Company Expands Electrical Equipment <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The telephone company in this county was founded in the first year of the Republic of China by Yang Hanxi and others. Initially, only merchants in the urban area installed telephones to facilitate communication. However, it was not yet widespread, so there were only a few hundred telephones in the entire city. In recent years, the company's business has been very developed, with the number of telephones increasing to more than 1,300. Various towns in the rural areas have also installed them. Recently, Mr. Yang purchased 120 more telephones from the United States for the purpose of expanding business, specifically for use by merchants in the urban area. At the same time, he ordered the mechanics to actively set up telephone lines, which are now ready for users to gradually install. According to someone from the company, the telephones in the urban area have had a slight surplus in recent years, but the cost of the telephone lines is very high. Once they are damaged, the repair costs are also not light. In the rural telephone areas, there is no profit to be made, because the telephone charges are the same as in the urban area, but the telephone poles are placed very far apart, and repairs are not easy, and the losses are even greater. Currently, the telephone poles and lines in Zhangjingqiao in the seventh district have been damaged and should be replaced immediately, but the cost is too high, so it has to be postponed for the time being.</p>

<p>Qianqiu Lane in the city of Wujin is a bustling market. In the middle section is the Deyuanchang Paper Store, which has been open for many years. However, its business has been sluggish in recent years, and it has been managed by the late Wang Shaohua. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 PM on the 5th, a fire suddenly broke out in the storage room on the second floor of the store. At that time, the westerly wind was strong. In a few minutes, it had broken through the roof and spread to the neighboring Zhenda Rice Store. By the time the bell rang to warn the police, the fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene, and the fire had also spread to the opposite Xuyuanxing Iron Shop and Yilong Vegetarian Restaurant. The fire was so intense that it was rare in recent years in this city. At that time, the river water was shallow and difficult to use. After the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, it was extinguished after about an hour. However, the nearby electric poles were burned down, and most of the lights and telephone users in the entire city were in a dark world and could not make calls. Afterwards, the company sent many craftsmen to try to repair them. It was not until around 9:00 PM that the repairs were completed. Sun Meicheng, the chief of the first sub-bureau of public security, sent the police to summon the store owner for questioning because the origin of the fire at Deyuanchang was unknown, but the store owner had disappeared.</p>

<p>The Ditch Works Committee of this county, seeing that the busy farming season is approaching, is making great efforts to advance the work. The committee's planned project, the embankment from Cuijia Bridge to Yonggu Township, is already half completed and will be fully completed in a week. The bridge body of Cuijia Bridge, which has been in disrepair for many years and is also an important transportation route, is currently being designed and a wooden bridge will be rebuilt. The farmland in the east of the township is relatively fertile. The committee originally planned to dredge the ditches, but after receiving opinions from enthusiastic locals such as Liu Zhixian, they believed that opening ditches would be more effective than dredging. Construction has now begun on excavating six ditches, divided into two teams of about seventy or eighty people. They are 820 zhang long, and 2400 fang in volume, with the narrowest being six chi and the widest being two zhang, and a depth of about four or five chi, to allow water to flow. One ditch has already been excavated and will be completed soon. More than a thousand mu of farmland will benefit. The committee will subsidize each fang with two jiao and two fen. Liu, considering the difficulty of the work, plans to increase it to two jiao and five fen. All the excavation costs are advanced by him.</p>

<p>The provincial government investigated and found that Xu Daochun, a sandbar operator in Nantong, occupied 1,500 mu of滩田 in the sixth and seventh圩 in Changyin Sandbar. All were confiscated and ordered the county government to recover. Xu resisted and refused to pay and was detained, but stated that the land in the sixth and seventh圩 did not belong to him and requested release. County Magistrate Cheng stated that this case had been decided by the provincial government, and Xu Daochun must sign a guarantee to hand over the occupied land before bail would be granted. This was rejected.</p>

<p>Li Chuhua, a 25-year-old accountant from Ningxiang, Hunan, stationed at the Third Branch Office of the Quzhou Security Corps, led his orderly, Wang Qinggen, 30 years old, also from Hunan, from Quzhou to the provincial capital on the morning of the 4th of this month. They stayed at No. 8, Wouhe Inn, Jin'gang Temple Lane, Cheng Station. On the morning of the 5th, he went to the Provincial Security Corps to receive 2,500 yuan in cash, one Browning pistol, two wooden holsters, eight rifles, and fifteen bayonets. After returning to the inn for lunch, he went out to shop and had a small drink at a restaurant. He returned to the inn to rest late at 11 pm. This morning (the 6th) at 6:40 am, Li's orderly got up first, locked the room door, and told the tea boy that he was still sleeping and should not be disturbed, and that he would be back around 10 am. After finishing, he left on his own. At 11 am, the Security Corps sent someone to deliver official documents. The tea boy knocked on the door but received no response. He broke the lock and entered, seeing Li lying on the bed, with fresh blood flowing from his mouth and his tongue protruding about an inch. Lifting the quilt, he saw a hemp rope around his neck. The tea boy and others were shocked and knew that a major incident had occurred. They immediately telegraphed the Security Corps and the local Public Security Bureau to send police to the inn. Upon inspection, the 2,500 yuan in cash he had received was gone. Only 70 yuan, which his friend had entrusted to him, remained in his bag. It was clear that the orderly, Wang Qinggen, had murdered him for money by strangulation. However, no sound was heard from the next room during the murder, and how he did it is still uncertain. They immediately reported to the Hangzhou Land Court, which sent a prosecutor and officials to examine the body at 4 pm. They determined that there was only one mark from the hemp rope on the neck, and he was undoubtedly strangled to death. Afterwards, military and police agencies dispatched personnel to ports and stations to conduct strict inspections, in order to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>The Polish envoy to Japan, Mr. Molski, recently went to Manchuria for inspection and gave a speech to Japanese reporters. According to telegrams, he said that the Polish government was prepared to recognize the puppet state and planned to exchange views with the Polish consul stationed in Harbin on the specific details of recognizing the puppet state. This has aroused serious attention from all parties in China and abroad. According to a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency, in order to clarify Poland's attitude towards the puppet state, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently telegraphed the Polish envoy in Shanghai, asking for the truth. It is heard that the Polish envoy, Mr. Wei Dentao, in order to avoid causing ill will between China and Poland, took a night express train to Nanjing the night before last to explain to our authorities.

Because Mr. Cunningham was busy with official business, he was received by Consul Mr. Mewshaw. According to the conversation, regarding the rumors that the United States would recognize the puppet state, the American Consulate and Embassy had not heard anything about it.

<p>Sweep Away the Evil Atmosphere and Glorify Our Han People</p>
<p>Mountains and Rivers as Oath, Eternal Sincerity</p>
<p>Zhang Zhichao, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army of Eastern China, in view of the fact that the violent Japanese instigated Pu Yi to usurp the throne and proclaim himself emperor, which has become a reality, in addition to sending his councilor Wang Chuanjing to Shanghai to report on the army's recent situation, specially issued a telegram on the Eastern Daily, asking the whole country to denounce it unanimously. A reporter from the Far East News Agency visited Zhang Zhendong, the Shanghai representative of Commander-in-Chief Zhang, at his residence yesterday and was shown the telegram that had just been transferred from Peiping. The text is copied as follows: To all the elders, brothers and sisters in the country, all newspapers and museums, for your perusal, the Northeast has fallen for more than two years, the Japanese and puppet traitors have been wreaking havoc, creating an unprecedented shame and trying to survive for a while. Zhichao and others, by virtue of their duty, cannot but cry to our compatriots. There was the Nakamura incident, and then the Wanbaoshan case, followed by the fall of Shenyang, the fall of Jilin and Heilongjiang, and finally the invasion of Yuguan and the capture of Rehe. Their deep and insidious intentions are known. Recently, the deployment of troops in western Liaoning is to prepare for the occupation of our Chahar province, and Pu Yi's usurpation of the throne is to be the prelude to the invasion of our China. The encroachment will never end. Since September 18th, Zhichao and others, in accordance with the duty of every man, swore to defend the country with their lives. They led patriotic warriors and rushed between the Black Mountains and the White Waters, using broadswords to resist the enemy's scientific weapons and using hand-to-hand combat to resist the enemy's fierce artillery fire. First, they maneuvered in eastern Jilin, then fought bloody battles in Heilongjiang, broke Mulan, conquered Dongxing, seized warships at the mouth of the Sanpin River, and broke through heavy encirclement at the foot of the Daqing Mountains. They dispersed into parts and harassed various places. Recently, they descended on Jiamusi with a hundred riders and killed Japanese armed immigrant groups. Although they failed to restore the mountains and rivers and return our land, they can also show the patriotic spirit of our entire nation and not succumb to the oppression of the Japanese pirates. Now, the Japanese pirates are insatiable and seek to carry out further aggression, instigating the puppet Pu Yi to usurp the throne and proclaim himself emperor, intending to use the name of restoring the old power of the Qing dynasty to complete their swallowing of our entire country. It is seen that the divine and brilliant Chinese descendants will be completely annihilated by the Japanese pirates of the three islands, and the 400 million compatriots will suffer again from the remnants of despotism. All those with blood and energy cannot but be infuriated. Zhichao and others, after surviving hundreds of battles, have long placed life and death out of consideration, and are willing to be pioneers and swear to maneuver around them. The river and mountains are oath, eternal sincerity. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will rise up together to sweep away this evil atmosphere and glorify our Han people. Zhang Zhichao, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army of Eastern China, guerrilla commanders Wang Zhenqi and Wang Zhenfang, led all officers and soldiers to pay their respects to the east.</p>

<p>=Yesterday's Letter Suggested to the Women's National Products Movement Association=</p>
<p>=Do Not Buy or Manufacture Imported Artificial Silk Fabrics Again=</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, in order to promote the use of domestic silk, revitalize sericulture, and save the economic bankruptcy of rural areas, yesterday specially suggested to the Women's National Products Movement Committee not to buy or manufacture imported artificial silk fabrics. The original letter said, (excerpt omitted) Regarding the proposal, this year has been decided by the public as the Year of Women's National Products, and the responsibility for promoting national products should be even greater than that of men. Moreover, according to the habits of our Chinese families, men manage outside and women manage inside. All the necessities of a family, such as clothing, food, entertainment, etc., are handled by the hostess, and the master does not ask about it. If the hostess can adhere to the principle of not using anything but national products and insist on implementing it, then</p>

<p>It can be expected in a matter of days, and national wealth and strength can be assured. Our association has been committed to promoting national products and revitalizing industries for more than 20 years. As for the results, where are the results? With an import surplus of 900 million, the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. Saving the dying is too late, and it is extremely heartbreaking. I have examined the reason, which is the lack of strength and no way to punish. Empty words are useless and are forgotten in a blink of an eye. Those in power cannot set an example themselves, practice diligently, and save the unprecedented disaster. The vast majority of those below are also ignorant, not knowing, competing for fashion, and not caring about the national foundation, such as the phenomenon of last year's National Products Year. Alas, is there anything more tragic than this in the world? It is no wonder that this year is designated as the Year of Women's National Products, with the hope that women across the country will work hard</p>
<h3 id="e116">To Wash Away This Shame <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>To revitalize the national spirit of our great Chinese nation. It is found that in recent years, the bankruptcy of rural areas in our country has become increasingly serious, and it is urgent to find ways to save it. Otherwise, if the skin does not exist, what will the fur adhere to? However, if we want to save it, we must first revitalize sericulture, and to revitalize sericulture, it is especially necessary to promote the use of domestic silk fabrics. Because our silk has been a famous national quintessence for thousands of years. Since the import and sale of foreign silk satin, wool, and artificial silk fabrics into China, our silk industry has been squeezed, declining year by year. Today, it is in a dying state, with a tendency to disappear completely. Seven or eight out of ten silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have closed down. If we talk about saving rural areas in this way, is it not going south by driving the chariot north? I suggest that the following two things be resolved, widely publicized, announced to the country, and earnestly implemented in order to reverse the decline and consolidate the foundation of the country. (1) Strictly prohibit wearing Europeanized imported clothes such as overcoats. (2) Do not buy or manufacture imported artificial silk fabrics again. The two items on the right are the fundamental plan for promoting domestic silk, revitalizing sericulture, and saving rural areas. Because the prosperity of domestic silk will naturally lead to the prosperity of sericulture, and the prosperity of sericulture will lead to the prosperity of the rural economy. This is a natural principle and they are interconnected. This matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that the public will decide to implement it.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union Telegraphed: All provincial and municipal party departments, governments at all levels, legal entities, and newspapers for your perusal.</p>
<p>In independent countries around the world, the navigation of inland rivers is prohibited to foreign vessels, in order to protect the domestic shipping industry. Since our country signed unequal treaties in the late Qing Dynasty, inland waterway navigation rights have fallen into the hands of foreigners. As a result, foreign vessels can freely travel in our mainland, seize the market, and manipulate commerce, causing the shipping industry run by Chinese people to be greatly affected and losing its development space, forming today's economic decline. Speaking of this, it is unbearable to be sad and indignant. Now that the Sino-British and Sino-American commercial shipping treaties have expired, we should take the opportunity to recover inland waterway navigation rights and abolish the previous unequal treaties. In addition to submitting a request to the Ministry of Communications to send representatives to participate in the shipping conference in order to contribute opinions, our association also hopes that the people of the country will work together with one heart, advocate unanimously, and urge the government to negotiate strictly to achieve the goal of recovery, in order to save the doom of our country's shipping industry. The future of the country depends on it. A special telegram is sent for your information, which is extremely urgent. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union kowtows, fish.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Telegram Requesting Transfer of Order to Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to Collect Import Tax on Foreign Rice <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry and Bean Rice Industry Association Telegraphed Chairman Chiang to Request the Transfer of Order to Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to Collect Import Tax on Foreign Rice. The original telegram said: For the perusal of Chairman Chiang in Nanchang, the huge waves of the world economic panic and the crisis of the collapse of rural areas in the country are invading each other, shaking the foundation of the country. The dumping import of foreign food and the obstruction of the sales of domestic rice are the most fatal injuries. Last year, the China Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau wanted to seek control of agricultural products to prevent the encroachment of foreign rice, and the government also successively relaxed the ban on grain exports and increased the import tax on foreign rice and wheat. These are all good policies to relieve people's livelihood. However, the order for the tax on foreign rice and wheat is exclusive to Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces. The government's intention is to expect that the Guangdong and Fujian provinces have already established bureaus by the provincial government to collect taxes separately, in order to avoid duplication, and temporarily exclude them. As for the people's food in Guangxi province, it can be self-sufficient. Since there is no need to rely on foreign rice, there is no need to increase the tax. However, Guangdong and Fujian provinces have always been areas short of rice. Before the new tax was announced, they were purchased in Shanghai, Hunan, and Anhui areas. After the announcement, they stopped. The tax rate has not been unified, and foreign rice takes the opportunity to dump. Although Guangdong and Fujian provinces have separately established bureaus to collect taxes, the tax rate is only one-third of the customs duty. This is tantamount to opening one side of the net in South China and giving foreign rice an opportunity to invade. According to statistics, since the middle of last month, 400,000 bags of foreign rice have been imported into Guangdong province from Hong Kong, and they are still following each other. Fujian province also has a huge amount. American aviator</p>

<p>Po Lei Returned to Shanghai Yesterday to Welcome</p>
<p>Colonel Fielon Hawke, the American aviator hired by the American United States Airlines to perform aviation skills in China, originally arrived in Shanghai on the McKinley mail ship of the Big Lai Company at 5:30 pm yesterday. According to the company, the ship will arrive at the White Lotus Pond Big Lai Wharf at 8 am this morning. Po Lei, General Manager of the United States Airlines, went to Hangzhou the day before yesterday to negotiate the performance matters and rushed back to Shanghai yesterday morning. He will accompany the American political and business leaders in Shanghai to the ship this morning to welcome him. After Mr. Hawke lands, he will be accompanied by Po Lei to rest at the Cathay Hotel. The Curtis large aircraft he brought has been requested by the United States Airlines and the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to issue a passport so that it can be picked up, transported to Hangzhou for installation. After the installation is completed, it will be performed in Hangzhou and Shanghai. Import, so the sales of domestic rice are even more obstructed. Looking at the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, rice and grain are piled up and cannot flow, and the price of rice has plummeted and cannot recover. Farmers and merchants are in distress, and dangerous conditions are emerging. If we do not seek to remedy the situation urgently, then the so-called grain control and rural revival, even with great plans, will be difficult to achieve. Now that the Fujian rebellion has been quelled and the political orders are unified, the foreign rice tax bureau established in that province can be abolished and merged into the customs for tax collection in accordance with the regulations. As for the foreign rice tax in Guangdong province, it may be related to the provincial treasury and it is difficult to change it temporarily. Then it can also be incorporated into the customs for collection, and the original tax amount can still be returned by the customs temporarily. In this way, tax revenue can be unified, domestic rice can be sold smoothly, the foundation of the country can be cultivated, and the people's distress can be relieved, all depending on this. I dare not take the liberty and ask you to examine and approve it quickly and separately order the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Guangdong and Fujian provinces to approve the handling as requested. The telegram is trembling and extremely urgent. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association and Bean Rice Industry Association, kowtows.</p>

<p>According to Reports, There are 13 Million Mu of Wasteland</p>
<p>If Converted to Cotton Fields, 3 Million Dan Can Be Collected Annually</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission, in order to investigate the area of wasteland in the Lianghuai salt area and prepare for reclamation, specially organized an inspection team to the Lianghuai salt area to conduct on-site inspections. It is learned that the inspection team has completed the inspection and reported the results to the Economic Commission. It is said that there are a total of 13 million mu of wasteland in Lianghuai. If all of them are opened up for planting cotton, it can produce one dan of clean cotton for every four mu, and can collect 3 million dan of net cotton every year, which is enough to resist the total amount of imported cotton. However, in order to be prudent, the Economic Commission plans to select experts for a second inspection to conduct a detailed survey of the soil, water conservancy basic projects, and what kind of cotton varieties are suitable for planting. Once this second inspection is completed, it will begin to reclaim the land.</p>

<p>Currently Being Planned by Xu Zhongdi and Shen Enlin</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Shanghai Economic Committee is currently organizing a Cotton Production Improvement Institute due to the approaching planting season for new cotton. The aim is to select and purchase high-quality cotton seeds to distribute to farmers in cotton-producing areas in various provinces for planting. Yesterday, a reporter inquired with the committee, and according to the person in charge, this matter has indeed been under consideration. Currently, Commissioners Xu Zhongdi and Shen Enlin are responsible for the planning. However, it has not yet reached a finalized stage. Furthermore, after implementation, each cotton-producing province such as Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangsu will need to establish a Cotton Production Improvement Institute, subordinate to the Control Committee. The plan is vast, and the required funding is also substantial. Although the new cotton planting season is approaching, it is still unknown whether the government can allocate the hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding at once. Therefore, it can be said that currently, there is only a plan, and it has not reached the implementation stage. As for the investigation of cotton production, transportation, improvement, and manufacturing in North China and Central China previously conducted by personnel dispatched by the committee, those currently in Wuxi are Fu Daoshen, in Changsha, Hunan Province, are Liu Jusheng, in Hankou are Xiao Lunyu and Zheng Yansan, and in Tianjin are Nie Guangyu. However, each group will proceed to the next location after completing their investigation here. Although reports are being received successively, they are still being整理, but cannot be released yet. For example, Fu Daoshen in Wuxi still needs to go to Jiangyin and Changshu. Therefore, it is expected that all groups will return to Shanghai in mid-April, it is said.</p>

<p>Location Selected at the District Municipal Committee Office</p>
<p>The Mobile Agricultural Products Exhibition organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been held successively in Luxing, Yangsi in Pudong, and Caoxing and Huangjia Garden in Puxi.

<h3 id="e136">Telegram Bureau Chief Wu Baofeng Discusses the Issue of Joint Establishment of Postal and Telegraph Offices <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Inspect the Actual Situation First</p>
<p>Drafting Methods to be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>Shanghai Telegram Bureau Chief Wu Baofeng recently went to Beijing and has already returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically interviewed Mr. Wu. According to him, the details of his trip to Beijing are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Telegram Bureau Reorganization Plan <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu first stated that after taking office, he drafted opinions on the internal reorganization plan and submitted them to the Ministry for approval. During this trip to Beijing, he personally presented the plan to Minister Zhu. Mr. Wu believes that the existing buildings of the Telegram Bureau are inconvenient for business operations and intends to rebuild them. Minister Zhu stated that the Ministry of Communications is currently planning to consolidate the telecommunications agencies under its jurisdiction in Shanghai into one location to facilitate operations and achieve synergistic effects. Shanghai is a vital transportation hub, and its industrial and commercial prosperity is unmatched in the country. This plan seems to need to be realized as soon as possible. Therefore, the issue of rebuilding the Telegram Bureau will be addressed after the Ministry of Communications decides on the overall plan.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Issue of Paying Security Deposits <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu further mentioned the issue of paying security deposits. The Ministry of Communications previously, in order to facilitate and expedite the procedures for telegram senders, required business firms and residents who frequently send telegrams to pay a certain amount of security deposit on a monthly basis. This security deposit is deposited by the Telegram Bureau with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, which pays interest. This method can save telegram senders from the accounting complications each time they send a telegram and significantly speed up the process. The purpose of the Ministry of Communications' move is solely to provide convenience for merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Joint Establishment of Postal and Telegraph Offices <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wu also discussed the issue of jointly establishing postal and telegraph offices. Although this is for the sake of saving costs for postal and telegraph agencies, it can also greatly benefit the people in practice. In the future, postal and telegraph offices in various locations will gradually seek joint establishment based on actual needs. In Shanghai, the Telegram Bureau will work with the Shanghai Postal Administration to dispatch personnel to inspect the actual situation of postal and telegraph offices of the third class and below. Then, considering the market conditions in each location, a plan for joint establishment will be drafted and submitted to the Ministry for approval, after which implementation can begin.</p>

<p>Twelve silversmiths' outside workers, including Yao Xinrong and Ding Axiang, went to the Silversmiths' Guild Hall on Huayuan Street outside the Dadongmen on the previous day to fast in order to awaken the silver shop owners. The Silversmiths' Trade Association specifically prepared food and sent personnel to persuade the workers to resume eating yesterday morning, but it was ineffective due to the workers' firm refusal. At 12:00 noon, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Dai Youheng, together with Zhu Guilin of the Social Affairs Bureau, to persuade the workers to resume eating and wait for mediation on the wage issue, but it was also ineffective due to the workers' resolute attitude.</p>

<p>Wage Reduction Circumstances According to the workers' statement yesterday, at 1:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, the factory directors of the first factory on Malang Road, the second factory on Jiaotong Road, the third and fourth factories on Jiaozhou Road (now merged), the fifth and sixth factories on Xietu Road, the seventh factory on Quzhenren Road, the eighth factory on Dapuqiao Road, and the ninth factory on Wenlin Road, and the tenth factory at Bashi Bridge, gathered the workers to make a speech, saying that the factory's output of woven products last year was better than in previous years, but since the beginning of the year, there have been no orders from various places, which proves that the sales of silk fabrics have been declining. In order to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the factory plans to slightly reduce salaries and wages. At 2:00 PM, each factory issued a notice to implement the wage reduction.</p>
<p>Workers' Resentment The total number of workers in Meyer factories is more than 4,000. Seeing this notice, they expressed their dissatisfaction. The factory had previously reduced all wages by 10% on July 1st of last year due to the decline in silk sales. At that time, in order to avoid increasing resentment between labor and capital, the workers did not argue. Unexpectedly, only half a year later, the capitalists cut wages again. With the exception of the warp factory's warp department, apprentices, and the dyeing and finishing factory on Luban Road, the workers in other departments have gone on strike one after another. The standard for wage reduction is to reduce existing wages to 85%. This year, the factory has reduced staff. Recently, it was also announced that monthly salaries above 26 yuan will be reduced appropriately.</p>
<p>Organize a Strike Committee After the workers in each factory went on strike one after another, the original trade union had been cancelled. Fearing that malicious elements would become active during the strike, representatives from each factory gathered yesterday morning to discuss the overall plan. It was decided that: (1) The wage level of the first half of 1933 should be restored. (2) A written petition should be submitted to the general manager requesting the withdrawal of the order. (3) If there is no result, a petition should be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau on a scheduled basis. (4) A strike committee should be established to facilitate negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Da Hing Ship and Xin Ping Ship Collide, Navigation Administration Bureau Sent Personnel to Inspect the Ships Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>=Xin Ping Suffered More Damage, Sent Letter to Da Hing for Negotiations=</p>
<p>=The Issue of Responsibility Will Be Judged by the Collision Committee=</p>
<p>The Xincheng Shipping Company's Xin Ping ship and the Antong Shipping Company's Da Hing ship collided at 5:53 AM on the 4th of this month at the Wusongkou entrance while entering the port, both ships were damaged, with Xin Ping suffering more damage than Da Hing. Yesterday, the Navigation Administration Bureau sent ship inspectors to investigate and will make a fair judgment in accordance with the law. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Entering Port at the Same Time The Xincheng Shipping Company's Xin Ping ship, located at 22 Hankou Road in this city, with a total tonnage of 3,200 tons, loaded 40,000 bags of salt from Haikou and transported them to Shanghai. It arrived at Wusongkou on the evening of the 3rd of this month. For safe navigation, it anchored and waited to enter the port the next morning. At the same time, the Antong Shipping Company's Da Hing ship, located at 220 Sichuan Road, with a total tonnage of 3,208 tons, loaded coal from Pukou and transported it to Shanghai. It also arrived at Wusongkou on the evening of the 3rd and anchored. The Xin Ping ship arrived at Wusongkou first and anchored in front of the Da Hing ship. At 5:50 AM on the 4th, both ships simultaneously raised their anchors and entered the port.</p>
<p>Collision While Avoiding the Ship When entering the port, the Xin Ping ship was in front of the Da Hing ship. When the Xin Ping ship was about to reach Wusongkou, it slowed down. The Da Hing ship increased its speed in the rear, intending to overtake. At that time, it was just dawn, and the navigation route was difficult to distinguish. At this time, there happened to be an oil tanker, which was said to belong to the Asiatic Petroleum Company, leaving Shanghai. The Da Hing ship wanted to avoid it, but due to the rapid tide, the bow of the Da Hing ship collided with the side of the Xin Ping ship's third and fourth cabins. After applying the brakes, the oil tanker left the port as usual.</p>
<p>Both Were Damaged The third and fourth cabins of the Xin Ping ship were struck and a hole was created. The rivets and iron plates were damaged. Fortunately, it was above the waterline and there was no major problem. It immediately sailed to the Jinliyuan Wharf, Huangpu River floating buoys number three and four, and docked. The bow of the Da Hing ship was slightly damaged by iron rivets. It sailed to the Beipiao Wharf and docked. After inspection by the shipowner, the damage was very minor. However, the Xin Ping ship suffered more serious damage, and it was reported that water had entered the salt艙.</p>
<p>Ship Inspection Yesterday The Xincheng Shipping Company submitted a report to the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications regarding the collision of the Xin Ping ship and requested an investigation. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Wang Xinyuan, a ship inspector from the Navigation Administration Bureau, first went to the Jinliyuan floating buoy to inspect the Xin Ping ship, and then went to the Beipiao Wharf to inspect the Da Hing ship. The Xincheng Shipping Company sent a letter to the Antong Shipping Company yesterday detailing the damage to the Xin Ping ship for negotiation.</p>
<p>Fair Judgment According to Law The Da Hing ship began unloading coal at the Beipiao Wharf the day before yesterday and will soon complete the unloading. The Antong Company also submitted a report to the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications regarding the collision. Since both companies are Chinese merchants, the issue of future responsibility will be fairly judged by the Collision Committee of the Navigation Administration Bureau in accordance with the law.</p>

(2) It was decided that if fire hoses, equipment, etc. of each section were damaged after the Shanghai War, each should submit a budget for replenishment to the Federation for review and appropriation. (3) Regarding the case of fire brigades in neighboring areas intending to join this association, whether the name of the association should be changed to the "North Shanghai District," it was decided to convene another joint meeting at a later date for serious discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Guangdong Fellow Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Regarding the Li Case Criminals Requesting an Appeal <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Request to Change to a Death Sentence</p>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association convened a support association yesterday to discuss requesting the police to file an appeal. It was unanimously stated that whether the sentence of life imprisonment for Zhou Zhanyuan in the Li Minzhou case was commensurate with the crime and circumstances was not up for debate. However, since the performance of duty resulted in an ambush, and thereafter duties are neglected and not dared to be questioned, this not only affects the progress of industry and commerce, but in other words, the negligence of the constables and the inability of supervisors to question them, and that gangs of reckless and negligent people run rampant without restraint, what kind of world is this, let alone social morals and national security. It was unanimously resolved that the association should first send a letter to the legal department of the Public Concession Police, as well as lawyers Feng Bingnan and Gan Xian, and various organizations, requesting joint assistance in order to maintain morals and preserve public security. The letter to the Legal Department of the Public Works Department is listed below: The Managing Director of the Sun Sun Company, Li Minzhou, died in the line of duty. The police of your department arrested the murderer and referred the case to the court for public prosecution, which shows the kindness of your department in eliminating violence and promoting good. All sojourners deeply praise this. However, the court's sentence in this case did not impose the death penalty. Whether the circumstances of the case were commensurate with the crime and circumstances is not for debate, but since the performance of duty results in assassination, the impact will be that no business will be able to perform its duties, and that gangs of reckless and negligent people will abandon their duties and not dare to question or deal with them. What kind of world will this be? Social morals, local security, and business progress will all be affected. Although the case is limited to one person, the impact is very significant. We dare to state the opinions of the public and earnestly hope that your department will immediately file an appeal in this case, requesting a change to a death sentence, in order to maintain morals and preserve public security. With urgent hope, we are awaiting orders. This is addressed to the Legal Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>

<p>Wu Chengfu, a native of Ningbo, learned carpentry in his youth. At the age of seventeen, he saw the function of waterwheels in the countryside and devoted himself to research, thinking of inventing a machine that utilizes water power. He spent more than twenty years of hard work and finally invented a generator that does not use kerosene. It only requires a small amount of water to obtain 20 horsepower of electricity, which can be commonly used in various factories. Mr. Wu is currently still an automotive carpenter, residing at No. 14, Tonghe Lane, Edward Road. He spends his spare time experimenting in the kitchen. Because he lacks financial resources, this machine has not been fully completed. He brought the drawings to the Municipal Party Department to report the situation and request assistance. Zhou Lianze, an officer of the People's Movement Section of the department, received him. After Mr. Wu stated the reasons, Chief Zhou praised him deeply and instructed him to clearly state the details of the machine for further review. Mr. Wu is now submitting a statement on the research and development of this machine, requesting assistance from party and government agencies.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department Board of Directors Will Consider Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the report submitted by the Shanghai Public Works Department Rickshaw Committee is currently being studied by a joint committee composed of the Police Committee and the Transportation Committee in order to submit a final proposal to the Public Works Department and the Board of Directors. The first thing to be considered is the conditions for rickshaw pullers renting cars. The most important recommendation in the Rickshaw Committee's report is to stipulate the maximum rental fee so that the income earned by the rickshaw pullers who rent cars can support their livelihood. Item 8 stipulates that the maximum rental fee is 80 cents per 24 hours, and for less than 24 hours, it will be reduced proportionally. The rental fee regulations will be formulated by the Public Works Department, and a clause will be added to the vehicle license stating, "The rental fee paid by the rickshaw puller shall not exceed the maximum amount approved by the Public Works Department." This section will be considered at the regular meeting of the Public Works Department Board of Directors this Wednesday, and it is believed that the date for the implementation of the new regulations will be decided at that time.</p>

<p>=Qiu Yinxiang's Nostrils Bleeding=</p>
<p>=High Court Designates Re-examination=</p>
<p>Yang Qiu Yinxiang, the pregnant wife of villager Yang Miaolang of Xin Kaihe Town, Chongming, committed suicide by hanging herself at home in May of the previous year (lunar calendar), with blood flowing from her nostrils. Her father, Qiu Chuanlang, filed a complaint in the original county, stating that the couple had previously been involved in a lawsuit due to not living together, and that she had been abused and injured after being forced back together, causing the blood to flow out. He requested that her son-in-law be dealt with. However, Yang Miaolang claimed that his wife returned to her parents' home in Ningbo and was stubbornly prevented from returning home by her stubborn father. During the lawsuit, his wife voluntarily followed her husband home. Therefore, her father hated his daughter for protecting her husband and would not return her clothes. Because he repeatedly went to get the clothes, he was repeatedly scolded and beaten, and she was forced to commit suicide. The original county verified that she had committed suicide by hanging herself. Her father refused to accept this, so the Jiangsu High Court designated the Shanghai District Court to investigate and re-examine the case. Upon receiving the order, the coffin was brought to Shanghai and sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy and re-examination. Yesterday, the coffin was opened, and it was found that the deceased's skin and flesh had rotted, making it difficult to examine. Therefore, the institute followed the procedures of the inspecting officials and used scientific methods to remove the bones for steaming and examination. The rotten flesh of the corpse has been removed, and then it is steamed and examined in a cage. It is said that it will take a week to determine the cause of death.</p>

<p>Chen Xiongfei, a Cantonese man, 35 years old, living at No. 7, Kejian Lane, Wusong Road, has been working as a cashier at Lao Jinlong Foreign Firm at No. 6, Suzhou Road for many years. However, Chen is addicted to gambling. He is proficient in horse racing, dog racing, jai alai, etc. Since the January 28th Incident the year before last until now, he has lost more than 49,000 yuan. Chen's family is not wealthy, so how did he get such a large sum of money? He took advantage of his position to engage in corruption and embezzlement, privately embezzling the goods funds paid to Lao Jinlong by customers without entering them in the accounts. Recently, the manager of the foreign firm heard about this and conducted a detailed investigation, discovering Chen's behavior. He reported it to the General Patrol House. The day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Li Yidong and Detective Car Student Zeng arrested Chen. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for occupational embezzlement, and stated that the case still needs to be investigated and requested a postponement. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned the defendant, Chen also confessed without denial. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned for two weeks for further hearing.</p>

<p>=Meifeng Electric Appliance Store Accused of Stealing Electricity=</p>
<p>=Zhu Shaoyi Describes the Investigation Process=</p>
<p>The Nanshi Huashang Electric Company has discovered that Meifeng Electric Appliance Store at No. 986, Yingxun Road Intersection, Xiaoximen Zhonghua Road, has been stealing electricity. The company's general manager, Lu Bohong, retained lawyer Wang Fuchang to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing the owners of the electric appliance store, Gu Quansheng and Zhang Quansheng, of jointly stealing electricity and requesting that they be punished according to law, as well as filing a civil lawsuit to jointly and severally compensate for electricity fees of 819 yuan, 9 jiao, and 3 fen. After receiving the complaint, the court issued summons. Because the defendants did not appear, Judge Zhang resumed the hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Wang Fuchang, and the defendants were represented by lawyer Liu Xiang. The first defendant, Gu Quansheng, did not appear. Only the second defendant, Zhang Quansheng, appeared in court and stated that he was 34 years old, from Changzhou, and ran the Meifeng Electric Appliance Store as a sole proprietorship. Asked if he co-owned the store with Gu Quansheng, he replied no. Asked how he stole electricity, he replied that he took over the store on September 2nd of last year and opened it on the 16th. The electrical wiring in the store had not been changed. At this point, lawyer Wang stood up and said that the plaintiff, Lu Bohong, had commissioned Qin Zhongying, an employee of the company, to represent him in court. He could explain the facts in detail. However, the first defendant, Gu Quansheng, was a craftsman in the company and co-owned the Meifeng Electric Appliance Store with Zhang Quansheng. However, the contract between the store and the company stated that it was Zhang Quansheng, etc. The official ordered witness Zhu Shaoyi to testify that he was currently the chief of the Electrical Affairs Section of the Huashang Electric Company. On the morning of February 5th, he was instructed by General Manager Lu to gather the staff of the Investigation Section and depart for investigation after stopping work at 5 PM that afternoon. He did not know where to investigate beforehand. At about 7 PM, he and the members of the Investigation Section, Chu Kexian, Qin Zhongying, Yao Xianting, and the craftsman, went to the Meifeng Electric Appliance Store to investigate. They saw more than 20 electric lights all lit. Upon inspecting the meter, it was not moving. After careful investigation, they discovered that a ground wire was connected to the tap water iron pipe next to the kitchen, which was evidence of stealing electricity. The current was flowing into the ground, so the lights were on but the meter was not moving. At that time, a craftsman in our company, nicknamed Little Wuxi, was also there. I asked who opened this store. Little Wuxi replied that he opened the store. I immediately interrogated him severely, saying that since you are a craftsman in the company, you should not do this, especially since the Construction Committee's rules are very strict. At that time, I was about to call the police, but he begged me not to report it to the police. He admitted to stealing electricity and wrote a note on the spot stating that he had stolen electricity and was willing to compensate for the loss (this note was submitted by lawyer Wang). Then I reported it to the general manager and, after carefully examining the employee roster, learned that Little Wuxi was the first defendant, Gu Quansheng, etc. The testimonies of witnesses Chu Kexian, Yao Xianting, Qin Zhongying, etc., were consistent with Zhu's testimony. Lawyer Wang also stood up and said that Gu Quansheng had been summoned twice but refused to appear. He requested the court to arrest him for strict investigation. As a result, the official ordered Zhang Quansheng to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan and leave for further questioning.</p>

<p>=More Than 500 Thatched Houses Destroyed=</p>
<p>=More Than 2,000 Families of Victims=</p>
<p>At 11:40 PM the night before last, a fire broke out in the thatched house jointly occupied by Han Dianfa (55 years old, from Yancheng) and Huang Defa (51 years old, from Yangzhou) behind the Xiaochaguan on Beijing-Jiang Road, Zhabei, due to careless frying of oil and rice. The fire quickly spread in all directions. Since the weather has been dry in this city recently, these thatched houses are very flammable, so the fire quickly became uncontrollable. After fire trucks from various places rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire, the area was too large and their efforts were in vain. The fire was finally extinguished at 1:25 AM this morning. The reporter immediately drove to the scene to investigate at about 8 AM. At the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Jiaotong Road, poor victims could be seen sitting and lying on the ground on both sides of Jiaotong Road. At the same time, the sound of crying was deafening. Even before reaching the fire site, it was known that the disaster was serious. Proceeding to the intersection of Jingjiang Road Branch Road, more than ten brick bungalows were seen destroyed. Further in, the auditorium of Dade Lane, named Tianwang Hall, along with more than ten brick bungalows in the lane, had been reduced to rubble. Looking north from here towards Jingjiang Road, what used to be the most lively market area, with Jiangbei shantytowns and brick bungalows arranged side by side, had turned into a vast wasteland. It is estimated that the disaster area covers no less than 30 mu. However, at this time, smoke and flames had not yet completely subsided. According to the results of the investigation, in addition to the aforementioned destroyed brick bungalows and a few scattered brick bungalows in various places, there were more than 50 Gu-family brick bungalows and more than 50 Tan-family brick bungalows, totaling about 150. According to a report from the Zhongxing Road Sub-station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, there were more than 500 thatched houses. Each of the above-mentioned thatched and brick bungalows housed two or three families, or four or five families, so the total number is estimated to be more than 2,000 families. The loss this time is estimated at 30 yuan per thatched house, totaling 15,000 yuan for 500 houses, and 100 yuan per brick bungalow, totaling 15,000 yuan for 150 houses. Other losses, such as shop assets and household furniture, are no less than several thousand yuan, so the total loss is estimated to be more than 30,000 yuan. Among them, some had fire insurance: Teng Yong Sheng Tobacco and Paper Shop had fire insurance for 500 taels, Jiang Yongfu Shoe Sole Shop at No. 16, Rengui Lane, had fire insurance for 700 taels, and Zhu Deben at No. 13, Jingjiang Road, also had fire insurance, but the amount is unknown. After the fire broke out, the fire starters, Han Dianfa and Huang Defa, were immediately arrested by the Zhongxing Road Sub-station and sent to the Fourth District. The number of victims is about 4,000 to 5,000, most of whom are poor people who seek a living day by day. Except for a small number who temporarily went to live with relatives and friends, the rest are homeless, living in the open air, looking emaciated and gaunt, which is heartbreaking. It is hoped that philanthropists will quickly find ways to provide relief, and the merits will be immeasurable.</p>

<p>=No One Knows the Details=</p>
<p>=Some Say It's Due to Oxygenation=</p>
<p>Gu Genda, 38 years old, a local Shanghai resident, and garment maker, lived in the west of Qiujiang Road, north of Xiangyin Road, Baqiu Association. His father has passed away, his mother is 71 years old, his wife is 34 years old, his son is 11 years old, and his daughter is 8 years old. The family is not wealthy, so their life is stretched thin and not comfortable, but they live in peace. He had a cousin, Gu Linsheng, 38 years old, also a garment maker, who lived in the same house as Genda. Their relationship was usually very good. There was also a cousin in mourning, Gu Gendi, 27 years old, who ran a small business. His house was only separated by a small vegetable market. They also had close relations and had no disputes. The assets of each person were clearly divided by the previous generation, so there was no entanglement. However, the day before yesterday (the 5th), Gu Genda went to Jiangwan with Gu Linsheng to redeem pawned items because the weather was getting warmer and spring clothes were due.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Insurance Companies Meet to Discuss Salvaging the Zhaoxing Ship <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Cargo and Ship to Be Salvaged Simultaneously</p>
<p>After the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship collided with the Zhaoxing Company's Zhaoxing ship, the Zhaoxing ship sank immediately. The various insurance companies underwriting peace insurance decided to carry out salvage and are scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss salvage methods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Consultation Method: After the Zhaoxing ship sank, the insurance companies underwriting the Zhaoxing ship's peace insurance, including Zhaotai, Tiantai, Dahua, Huaan, Lianbao, Ningshao, Sincere, Taiping, Liantai, Yongning, Haihai, etc., decided to salvage it. The day before yesterday, they contacted the Shanghai agent of the Japanese Salvage Company, Mitsui &amp; Co., and immediately telegraphed the Japanese headquarters to inquire about the procedures and salvage costs. It was decided to convene a meeting of the underwriting insurance companies to discuss the salvage steps after receiving a reply from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Salvage of Cargo: The passengers and cargo loaded on the Zhaoxing ship, including flour, piece goods, and grain, were worth approximately 120,000 yuan and were insured by friendly insurance companies such as Black Sea. Now, the friendly insurance companies have decided to salvage it. Yesterday, they contacted the Zhaotai Lianbao insurance companies that underwrote the Zhaoxing ship's peace insurance and planned to salvage the cargo and ship at the same time. A meeting was scheduled for today at the Insurance Industry Association to discuss the method. This is because separate salvage costs are very high, and if you want to salvage the ship, you must first salvage the cargo. If you salvage the cargo first, the ship's position will move deeply, and the salvage of the ship in the future will inevitably be difficult. If they are salvaged at the same time, the cost will be reduced and no difficulties will arise.</p>
<p>Arbitration of Responsibility: After the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship is repaired, it will continue to be dispatched and commanded by the Military and Political Department's Rotation Office. The Zhaoxing and Sanbei companies have not yet directly negotiated last night. The Zhaoxing Company decided to wait for the insurance companies to meet today and ask experts to legally arbitrate the issue of mutual collision responsibility. It is said that after the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications received the report, it has not yet decided whether to convene a collision committee to arbitrate the case.</p>
<p>I don't know how to redeem them. He returned in the evening, but Gu Gendi, holding a knife in one hand and a stick in the other, lay in ambush in front of the house. At dusk, when he saw Gu Genda returning from afar, he knocked him down with a stick without asking the reason and then stabbed him with a knife, causing Gu Genda to suffer several knife wounds on his face, arms, and chest. The blows of the iron rod to the vital points were especially countless, so Gu Genda died of serious injuries on the spot. Although his family heard the news and carried him back for emergency treatment, he eventually became a wronged soul. However, what is strange is that when Gu Genda was subjected to a major attack, Gu Linsheng, who was traveling with him, stood by and watched. He did not rescue or call for help. When Gu Genda was seriously injured and about to die, he was able to allow Gu Gendi to escape calmly, whereabouts unknown. Therefore, after the Fourth Branch of the Fifth District learned about this, because Gu Gendi had already escaped, they arrested Gu Linsheng for questioning. His confessions were all about not knowing anything. After inquiring about the corpse's wife, she said that her husband and the murderer had no grudges, and she did not know whether there were any recent grudges. Therefore, the police station could not get any clues. However, according to the irresponsible words of nearby villagers, they said that it was due to oxygenation, so they turned against each other and staged this tragedy. Therefore, the police station is focusing its efforts on Gu Linsheng to find out the reason. On the one hand, it is reporting to the Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrest the murderer. On the other hand, it is ordering Qiu Hongting, the local guarantee of the eighteenth figure, to report to the District Court for examination yesterday afternoon. The corpse's wife also entrusted her cousin, Gao Youcheng, to go to the court to investigate. After the prosecutor's preliminary hearing, the local guarantor and the corpse's relatives did not know the contents of the case, so the official ordered that the case be investigated and examined further after the examination.</p>

<p>A Suicide Note Says He Doesn't Know Much一</p>
<p>一Unable to Explain the Circumstances一</p>
<p>Xin Da Xing Hotel, located at No. 178, East Xinqiao Street, Caishi Street, French Concession, was checked in by a young man at around 9 PM on the 4th. According to the claim, his name was Ma Amao, 18 years old, from Shanghai, a foreign goods merchant. He did not say where he lived. The porter led him to Room 5 on the third floor, paid the room fee, and closed the door to sleep. He got up at noon on the 5th, paid the room fee again, and opened the room for another night. Then he went out. At around 1 PM in the afternoon, he returned to the hotel and went to the room without making a sound. The porter thought he was sleeping. At 8 PM that evening, the porter, Wang Yongmei, from Taizhou, went upstairs to ask if he wanted to eat dinner. She knocked on the door for a long time, but there was no response. When she pushed the door, it could not be opened because it was bolted from the inside. So she looked inside from the window and saw Ma lying stiff on the bed, motionless. Knowing that something was wrong, she reported to the accountant to pry open the door and went inside to check. He had already died. Two small opium tin boxes and a piece of paper were found on the table in front of the bed. It was written in pencil, "I don't know much, I can't explain the circumstances, check Lihua," etc., seventeen words. It was then known that he had committed suicide by taking poison. The French Patrol House was immediately notified and sent detectives to investigate. An empty bottle, which seemed to be a medicine bottle, was found on the ground behind the door. The corpse was immediately sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy. Because no family members were found, the Second Special District Court was requested at noon yesterday to send prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic clerks to the site to verify that the deceased had committed suicide by taking poison while alive. The porter, Wang Yongmei, was questioned about the circumstances of the discovery. It was ordered that the corpse be photographed and buried by Tongren Fuyuan Hall, pending identification by family members. The corpse was wearing a gray fine striped cotton robe, a blue cloth long shirt, a striped cloth short shirt, white fleece trousers, fine striped cloth cotton trousers, a black velvet skullcap, yellow thread socks, and black leather shoes.</p>

<p>The waters of Wenzhou, Shengshan, and other places in Zhejiang Province, China, are concentrated fishing grounds. Since the beginning of spring this year, the weather has gradually become warmer, and the fishing season is approaching. The Fisheries Protection Office of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce believes that most of the fishermen's annual income depends on the spring fishing season. However, coastal outlaws take advantage of this time of fishermen's harvest to seize opportunities to rob. In order to protect the maritime safety of fishermen and prevent the above-mentioned outlaws, the office will dispatch ships Nos. 1, 2, 3, and Biaohai around the 20th of this month to patrol the waters of Shengshan, Shenjiamen, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Shanghai Telephone Bureau Converts City-Wide Underground Cables <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Avoids Wind and Fire Damage, Protects Traffic Safety</p>
<p>Zhabei Implements Three Expansions, Pudong Adds Operators</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to avoid the effects of wind and fire damage to the electrical wires and to ensure traffic safety, is converting all of the city's overhead poles and wires to underground cables. The third phase of expansion in Zhabei is actively underway, and due to the heavy call volume in Pudong, additional operators are being added. The details of these situations are outlined below:</p>
<p>Conversion to Underground Cables: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, recognizing the frequent damage to overhead poles and wires from hurricanes and fires, which results in substantial annual losses, and understanding that even with the dispatch of repairmen, traffic disruptions for users are unavoidable, Bureau Chief Xu Xueyu proposed a plan to convert all overhead poles and wires in the city to underground cables for permanent safety. This plan was approved by the Ministry of Communications, with an estimated material cost of approximately 120,000 yuan. The purchasing committee ordered the materials from the United States and Germany and had them shipped to Shanghai. The bureau's planned implementation of the conversion project began with the South Shanghai Ring Road. Since the start of construction, the section along Min'guo Road has been completed, and work is currently underway on the Zhonghua Road section. The bureau plans to convert other districts after the South Shanghai area is entirely finished.</p>
<p>Zhabei Phase Three Project: The first and second phases of the Zhabei telephone expansion were completed one after the other at the end of last year. However, the third phase, which involves organizing the cross-border sections and adding lines and equipment, is considered more important and difficult. The materials for the third phase have already arrived. The project starts from the Zhabei Yongxing Road branch and extends along Sichuan Road to Diswei Road and the Jiangwan Road area, organizing the electrical wires and adding lines where there are no existing ones. The project is expected to be completed within approximately three months.</p>
<p>Adding Operators: The Pudong Telephone Branch has been officially established. The "04" switchboard connecting Pudong with the concessions has been transferred to the Concession Telephone Company. After the Shanghai Telephone Bureau took over the cross-border electrical rights in the area, the daily number of calls has more than doubled, leading to an unusually high call volume. As a result, the two 800-line generator switchboards are insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, the bureau has added two operators to serve the area. Shops and residents in the Pudong area are also enthusiastically applying for new phone installations.</p>
<h3 id="e170">First Special Court Prosecutor Investigates Committee of Xu Case Support Association <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>=Recognizes that the Association's Published Declaration Insults the Court=</p>
<p>=Huang Xianggu and Others Arrived at the Court but Denied Everything=</p>
<p>The Prosecutor's Office of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, regarding the Xu case support association's declaration published in various newspapers on February 22nd, which contained numerous statements insulting the court, believes that these statements obstruct official duties. A summons was specially issued, ordering the seventeen members of the association to appear in court at 2:00 PM yesterday for questioning. However, only Huang Xianggu, Jiang Chiping, and Shao Xubai arrived at the designated time. Prosecutor Zhong Qing of the Seventh Tribunal first summoned Huang Xianggu for questioning. Huang stated that he was from Jian'ou, Fujian. The official asked if he was one of the elected members of the Xu case support association, to which he replied that he had no knowledge of the association and was certainly not a member. The official asked about the meeting held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on January 16th, where he was elected as a member, as recorded in various newspapers. Huang replied that while his name appeared in the newspapers, it was likely a mistake. The official stated that the police had already investigated and confirmed that he was indeed a member, to which Huang replied by requesting the announcement of the police's investigation process. The official then announced that the addresses of the seventeen committee members investigated by the police all matched. The official then asked why he had not clarified the newspaper report if he denied being a member. Huang replied that he had been busy and had not paid attention to the newspaper reports until he saw it in the news today. The official asked if, since he had never denied being a member in the newspaper report, it could be considered a fact. Huang replied that he had never received a notification from the association. The official asked if he thought the Huang Xianggu mentioned in the newspaper was another person. Huang replied that it was. The official asked if he had not been notified of the meeting at all. Huang replied that he had not received any notification. Then, Jiang Chiping was summoned. Jiang stated that he was from Jiangsu, residing at 146 Julai Road. The official asked if he was elected as a committee member at the meeting on January 16th, to which Jiang replied that he was not a member. The official stated that it was recorded in the newspapers. Jiang replied that he had heard people say so and then looked at the newspapers. Although his name was there, he was in court at the same time. The official asked if the meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was in the evening, to which Jiang replied that he did not go. The official asked how he could be elected as a committee member if he did not attend the meeting, to which Jiang replied that he did not know. The official asked if he had been notified after the election, to which Jiang replied that the election was an offer, but he had not accepted it. Sometime between the 18th and 19th, he heard from others and sent a letter of resignation on the 22nd. The official asked why he did not publish a statement in the newspaper denying his election as a committee member. Jiang replied that he had not received any notification from the association, and after sending the letter of resignation, he had not received any notice. The official then stated that organizing groups and acting within the law is permitted by law, and the court never interferes. The court believes that the declaration issued by the association is problematic and needs to be investigated, so you and others have been summoned to court for questioning. Jiang asked to be informed of the declaration in question, to which the official replied, "As a member of the association, have you not seen the declaration?" Jiang replied that he had not paid attention to it and had been too busy to inquire about other people's affairs. The official asked if Jiang had signed the declaration before it was published. Jiang replied that he had not participated in it at all and had not even seen the declaration. At this time, Prosecutor Zhong pointed out the statements in the declaration that concerned the court, word by word, stating that these statements were insulting to the court, and asked if Jiang had signed the declaration before it was published. Jiang replied that he had not participated in it at all and had not even seen the declaration. Finally, Shao Xubai was questioned: "Are you also a member of the committee?" Shao replied, "No." The official asked, "Your name is published in the newspaper?" Shao replied, "Newspapers cannot be relied upon. To serve as a committee member, you must first be notified and sworn in by the association before it is legal. I did not participate. Later, someone told me that I was elected as a committee member, thinking it was another Shao with the same name. When I knew it was me, I published my intention to resign in the newspaper. Moreover, I was not present at the meeting on January 16." The official asked, "When did you resign?" Shao replied, "I expressed it in the newspaper," and presented a newspaper to the court. He further stated, "Since I have already made such an expression, I cannot be responsible." The court noted that since the problem has already arisen, everyone is mutually shifting the blame, always saying they do not know, so they were questioned again about when they first learned of the declaration. Shao replied about a week later, and he expressed his resignation after the 23rd. The official asked if since there was no formal statement, he had tacitly acknowledged the title of committee member. Shao replied that he had already made an expression. The official stated that it was too late. After questioning, the official ordered each person to leave and wait for review.</p>

<p>=Over a Thousand Thatched Houses Reduced to Ashes=</p>
<p>=The Fire Started from the Outside, Which is Quite Peculiar=</p>
<p>Following the fire on Jingjiang Road the night before, another fire broke out on Datong Road, Zhabei, at 0:25 this morning. Pei Yuezhu, a 46-year-old man from Yancheng who makes a living carrying water for the Laohu Society, lived in thatched house number 698 at the end of Datong Road, Taiyang Temple, Zhabei. Zhu Yan, a 25-year-old woman from Funing who makes a living raising pigs, also lived in thatched house number 44 at the end of Datong Road. At 0:25 this morning, just as everyone was asleep, a fire suddenly broke out on the rooftops of the thatched houses outside the doors of Pei Yuezhu and Zhu Yan's homes. By the time the two families realized it, the fire had spread throughout the entire house and affected the surrounding neighbors. Pei and others were awakened from their dreams and rushed out in a panic, alarming the neighbors, who fled in haste, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, causing great chaos. The cries and shouts shook the area. At the same time, due to the drought and the fact that the houses covering more than ten acres around the area were all thatched, numbering over a thousand, the fire spread rapidly. By 11:00 AM this morning, all the thatched houses had been reduced to ashes. The fire brigades from all sections of Zhabei rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but the scope of the fire was too large and difficult to control. The fire was extinguished in one place only to break out in another, with little success. The flames reached the sky and were impossible to approach. As the reporter was drafting this report, the fire was still growing, and it was feared that over a thousand thatched houses would be reduced to ashes. Pei Yuezhu and Zhu Yan, from whose homes the fire originated, were taken to the Fourth District Police Station for questioning. However, according to the neighbors, the fire started from the outside, which is quite peculiar, indicating that someone had first lit a fire and then thrown it onto the thatched houses outside the door. At the same time, it was felt that the police facilities in this area were inadequate, otherwise, anyone intending to commit arson would not dare to do so so boldly, and the transmission of alarms could also be faster, without such a tragic situation.</p>

<p>=Committed More Than Ten Cases One After Another=</p>
<p>=He Was Willing to Do Anything, Including Murder and Robbery=</p>
<p>The notorious robber Xu Guifa, nicknamed "Rotten Foot Little Ningbo," and his accomplices Chen Jinchang, Chen Rongsheng, Zhang Qifu, Zhang Guibao, and Chen Kejian committed numerous major robberies in the British, Chinese, and French concessions. On the afternoon of January 30th of this year, at around 5:00 PM, French Concession detectives Lu Zhulin and Wang Rusong, Deputy Detectives Zhang Daorong, Bao Tan Liu Jinrong, Shen Jinshi, and Lu Jinxiang, upon learning that Xu was hosting a banquet at his home at 128 and a half Fuxu Road, inviting his accomplices, joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station and rushed to arrest Xu and his gang of three Chens and two Zhangs, as well as Zhang Asan, who received the stolen goods, and Chen Shutang, a suspect (Xu Guifa's brother-in-law, who answered phones at the US Consulate), and Yin Tiancheng, a total of eight people. They then went to 18 Tianyou Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei, the home of Chen Jinchang and Chen Rongsheng, and continued to arrest their wives Chen Ge and Chen Shi, and a woman named Huang Linmei, a total of three people. They found five pistols and forty-nine bullets in the house, and more than 400 yuan in cash on each person and in the house, and transferred them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. During the rescheduling, it was found that Xu Guifa, Chen Jinchang, and Chen Rongsheng assassinated Shao Wenbin, the head of the Huahui, (also known as Groom Ah Liu), on Huage Road in July of the previous year, and assassinated Wei Qiliang, a native of Siyang, in Nanqianjiatang in October of the 17th year. From June of the previous year to January 29th of this year, they and the two Zhangs successively robbed Lin Bingyi, a resident of the French Concession (3 Le Fang, Xiafei Road), Wang Songtao (15 Ren'an Lane, Songshan Road, a section member of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance), Zhu Ningzhi (68 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road), Qiang Maosheng (3 Deshun Lane, Avenue Edward VII), Wang Xianling (20 Yuzhen Lane, Lafayette Road), Yuan Zhaoqing (1 Zhishun Lane, Pu'en Jishi Road, Xiaowan, who opened a rickshaw company), and six other families, stealing gold, jewelry, diamonds, and other ornaments, clothing, and cash. In the Public Concession, they successively robbed five diamond rings from guests and prostitutes in a Shantou Road brothel, as well as a pistol and more than 200 yuan in cash, and large sums of money from two families, one surnamed Mou, at 592 Lane, Baike Road, and 23 Lane, 640 Seymour Road, as well as a pistol. They also robbed 11,000 yuan from the Bank of China on Nanshi Road, and successively robbed the Public Concession, Chinese Concession, and Hua-India police outposts of pistols and other major cases, which have been reported in previous newspapers. The police have completed the investigation and have retrieved nearly ten packages of rough and fine fur, silk clothing, and other original stolen goods from various pawnshops (it is heard that three of the five diamond rings stolen in the Shantou Road brothel case have been retrieved). Yesterday at noon, the police escorted twelve men and women, including the Xu gang, to the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo specially opened the Second Criminal Tribunal to try the case. The bailiffs brought the defendants to the court. After briefly asking their names, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the police investigation. Xu Guifa, Chen Jinchang, Chen Rongsheng, Zhang Qifu, Zhang Guibao, Chen Kejian, and Zhang Asan were charged with murder, repeated robbery, and receiving stolen goods according to the criminal law, and the stolen goods and pistols were presented to the court. The police lawyer also stated that the police had found that the five defendants, Chen Shutang, Yin Tiancheng, Chen Ge, Chen Shi, and Huang Linmei, were not involved in the case and should not be prosecuted. He requested that the court release them first. The judge then ordered that the five defendants who were not prosecuted be released in court and ordered that the defendants be taken down and interrogated separately. Xu Guifa, Chen Jinchang, and Chen Rongsheng directly admitted to the two murder cases and the various robbery cases when questioned by the court. They shook their heads stubbornly, revealing a fierce and fearless appearance. (The confessions are lengthy and omitted). Chen Kejian, Zhang Qifu, and Zhang Guibao confessed that they were recruited by Chen Rongsheng to commit robberies. Zhang Asan confessed that Xu Guifa brought five diamond rings to him and asked him to sell them for him, and he resold them to Li Hongzheng, receiving 1,100 yuan. Xu gave him 30 yuan, and he was arrested for returning 70 yuan to Xu Guifa. By this time, it was 1:30 PM, and the victims of the case had not yet been questioned. The court adjourned the trial to the 13th, appointed a defense lawyer, and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Con Artist Yang Letian's Fraud Case, More Victims Still Exist, Continued Trial Awaits Investigation <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Last autumn, the con artist Yang Letian got acquainted with the wealthy widow Bao Xu (named Xunru), and immediately used threatening words, claiming that her luck was unfavorable, and her fate palace was full of disasters, so she needed to find a way to ward off the disasters. The woman fell into his trap, and over the months, she was defrauded of a total of 3,000 yuan. Recently, she finally realized and reported it to the police, who sent detectives to arrest Yang and bring him to the First Special District Court. According to the defendant's confession, he admitted that he had received money from Xu, but claimed that he had a special relationship with Xu, and that the money was definitely not obtained by fraud. The official ordered the defendant to be taken into custody, pending further investigation and questioning. After this case occurred and was reported in the newspapers, anyone who had been deceived by Yang Letian was deeply touched and thought about dealing with it. For example, Zhang from Beiping and Wu Jiajun from Songjiang successively sent letters to Xu Xunru, inquiring about the details of Xu's fraud, so as to confirm whether the fraudster's tricks were the same. In addition, according to the police investigation, Lu Zhicheng and one person surnamed Zhu in this city were each defrauded of hundreds of yuan. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued trial of the case. The police summoned the witnesses and escorted Yang Letian to the court. Judge Deng Baosun opened the court to interrogate the defendant. First, the police lawyer Qian Jiu explained the investigation and stated that Lu Zhicheng and Zhu did not want to pursue the case because of the small amount of loss. However, this type of case is not one that can be prosecuted only by complaint, and even if the victim does not want to pursue the case, it does not affect the public prosecution. Therefore, it is requested that the witnesses be questioned and then postponed so that the police can reconsider. Then, Lin Zhixiang, a Ningbo woman who was Yang Letian's second landlord, testified in court, proving that Yang Letian invited women surnamed Wan to rent the remaining house at 8 Airen Lane, Avenue Aivenyi. Since Yang moved in, Xu Xunru also came every day at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon and stayed until 3:00 or 4:00 at night. She often heard them laughing and talking in the room. When she saw Xu, she called her Yang Shimu, and she also responded happily. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Judge Deng stated that the case still needs to be investigated and ordered the defendant to be taken into custody and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>

<p>Call for Donations: Last autumn, the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan suffered from floods, affecting millions of people. Their homes were lost and their fields destroyed. They were only able to temporarily preserve their lives with the help of emergency relief. The suffering of these victims is likely beyond our imagination. The spring plowing season is approaching, and the victims lack seeds, farming tools, and livestock. Some even lack shelter. Alas, what crime have the victims committed, their hard-earned gains of the entire year being snatched away in a single day? If benevolent gentlemen do not rise to offer assistance, it is feared that none will be left. Under the current circumstances, they are not entirely without hope, as the Committee has already dispatched personnel to the most severely affected areas to investigate the needs of farmers, guide the formation of mutual aid societies, and lend appropriate amounts of funds to enable the victims to gradually restore their self-reliance. People widely praise the enthusiastic philanthropists across China who are donating millions to expand this agricultural relief effort. The victims place their hopes on the Committee, and the Committee should do its best to find ways to succeed. However, we must realize that this is not something that can be achieved by one person alone. It requires our united cooperation to succeed. Our Yellow River disaster relief campaign is being carried out separately in major cities across China, both in the north and south, either in the initial stages of organization or actively underway. Now that the Spring Festival has passed, we should strive to work harder to bring this campaign to a swift and successful conclusion, so that these more than three million victims will have the opportunity to rejuvenate and thrive.</p>
<p>Reports on Relief Efforts from Various Quarters: Nanjing | The Nanjing Fundraising Association for Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief has a promising start. The association held its opening ceremony at the Lìzhì Society on February 25th, following the banquet of the Fourth Plenary Session.

This campaign began with a banquet hosted by Mr. Wang Zhengting, Chen Guangfu, and Zhu Qinglan at the YMCA to discuss the project with leaders from all sectors. During the banquet, two people pledged to donate 1,000 yuan each, and one person pledged to donate 2,000 yuan. The other guests all took donation registers and went separately to solicit donations from their relatives and friends. The amount collected was also quite considerable. Beiping: The Committee has now received 18,500 yuan in donations. Last month, Chairman Huang of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee specially hosted a tea party to entertain the fundraising committee members, and he offered many words of encouragement. Among those who attended were He Yingqin, the chairman of the North China Military and Political Branch, and Zhou Dawen, the former mayor of Beiping. Recently, three women's organizations in Beiping donated 2,000 yuan to the Committee from the proceeds of a Yellow River disaster winter relief entertainment event held at the Beijing Hotel, as Yellow River disaster relief funds. Their benevolence and eagerness to help the public are deeply admirable. Changsha: The Changsha Fundraising Committee for Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief was fortunate to have Chairman He generously agree to serve as honorary chairman, and both the military and political circles pledged to donate 10,000 yuan. The committee was jointly organized by the Hunan branch of the Committee and the YMCA, and He Lide, Xie Guozhao, Zhou Anhan, and others were publicly elected as committee members. Hankou: The Hankou Yellow River Flood Relief Association, jointly formed by the Hubei branch of the Committee, the YMCA, and the members of the Chamber of Commerce, jointly launched the Hankou Fundraising Committee for Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief, with He Hengfu, Hu Bixiang, Zhou Cangbai, Xu Weirong, Gong Chengde, Tao Deman, and Song Baoluo guiding the process.

Wuhu: In early January, the Committee received a report from Wuhu stating that Dr. Bao Rang, the director of the Wuhu Public Hospital, had held a meeting at his residence to raise Yellow River disaster donations. Attendees included Wuhu County Magistrate Wang Zhuren, Public Security Bureau Chief Mei Yonggui, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wu Xingzhou, Education Bureau Chief Chen Yingfu, Pastor Han Rendun, as well as Ke Shufa, Ku Shuping, Sun Yingqing, and Yuan Wei. This fundraising campaign will be carried out separately under the leadership of the county magistrate. Hangzhou: The Hangzhou Fundraising Committee for Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief was initially convened by Mayor Zhao Zhiyou, Pastor Ming Sider, Mr. Wu Lifu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the local Bank of China president. Twenty-five people attended the meeting, and it was decided on the spot to do their best to raise 10,000 yuan in relief funds for the victims. The campaign is currently underway, and it is reported that 5,000 yuan has already been raised. Ningbo: Ningbo County Magistrate and Chairman of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Chen Baolin convened a meeting, attended by fifteen leaders from various sectors, including Zhao Cisheng, Jiang Jieqing, Wang Wenhan, Yu Jimin, and Wang Haonan, who served as honorary directors.

(Compassionate Flower Sign): The Committee has specially printed a type of compassionate flower sign to raise funds for the Yellow River Disaster Agricultural Relief, which has been promoted in both Beijing and Shanghai with considerable success. The promotion method is mostly carried out with the assistance of student groups from universities and middle schools, and it has been quite smooth. Each sign sells for two cents, and every fifty signs sell for one yuan. Local fundraising committees can make great use of promoting the flower signs to increase donations. If you wish to undertake sales, please contact the General Committee at No. 6, Caichang Hutong, Dongcheng, Beiping.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e184">Reading and Writing (II) (Continued) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>However, to achieve success in literature, there is another aspect you must pay attention to. Literary success lies not only in the form of the words but, most importantly, in the content. What you write should represent someone's voice and align with the demands and rhythm of the times. Does it genuinely have a considerable understanding of society? Is it intimately familiar with the lives of various social groups? For example, in your piece "Remnants of a Decaying Era," although in terms of consciousness, you expressed that "What is there to pity? This is the fate bestowed by the historical era," the result is that you still "take out all the few copper coins from your pocket." The atmosphere of the whole piece is still filled with a humanitarian sentiment, with a touch of melancholy. As for the subject matter, using the incident of "stealing a big cake from a cake shop and being injured by the shop assistant with an iron rod from the stove, and even with boiling water..." Even if this is true, even if we use the techniques of New Realism, I think using a cake shop assistant to represent the cruelty of all oppressors, if written factually, like reflecting in a mirror, would instead become a technique of Naturalism, making the adversarial aspect between groups even less clear; not to mention the "suggestion" that "everyone is a little indignant!" This is entirely a compassionate heart, not finding the truly angry target! (Or at least not very clear.)</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of material in "Remnants of a Decaying Era," it is not very clever—please forgive my bluntness—but this work is still a progressive piece. Its consciousness is correct. Currently, indeed, there are remnants of a decaying era. It is a pity that such good content has not found a more suitable form. This point is probably because the author still lacks understanding of New Realism and is unconsciously still influenced by Naturalism. Correcting this shortcoming, I think, is not difficult with the author's talent, as long as you pay more attention to several New Realist methods of expression.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of expression, it is not just a matter of the skill of the words but also depends on whether one is familiar with and sympathetic to social groups. New Realism is not a slogan or catchphrase but the life of the masses, a record and guide in motion. For example, regarding the work mentioned above, it is just a sketch, not yet a novel because the descriptions of the characters and the composition of the surrounding environment do not yet meet the conditions of a novel. If we consider a complete novel, it would be quite difficult to write about an environment and characters that one is not familiar with. The result would be to walk into idealism, not only superficial and boring but also unable to achieve considerable success in the expression of the words. Therefore, we advocate that a new writer, in their efforts, should spend 20% of their energy on writing skills and 80% on content. We spare no effort in repeating that a New Realist writer should have a correct worldview, a correct understanding of the world, and a correct understanding of society. They should be one of the masses, not an observer or sympathizer; they should be familiar with the lives, wills, and demands of the masses and be able to speak for the masses.</p>
<p>At the same time, they should also learn new forms of expression and critically accept the legacy of their predecessors.</p>
<p>I have said too much. Regarding writing, I will stop here for now. Please criticize any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Finally, I have the following two suggestions for your reading plan:</p>
<p>1. In the area of literature and art, you should read a few more famous works of literary theory.</p>
<p>2. Bukharin's Materialist Conception of History and Sociology is not good reading material in the near future. There are many errors in the book, which I will point out when I have the opportunity. For now, I specifically recommend the "Course in Dialectical Materialism" (translated by Li Da, published by Bigengtang) to replace Bukharin's work. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Children and Environment <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Kun</p>
<p>Who can deny that children are like a piece of white jade? This piece of white jade must be carved to become a treasure. But who is the person who does this carving? Of course, it is the parents who are closest to the child. At the same time, a child's environment is also something that the child's parents can improve; or cause to become evil. Children intentionally pursue their lives according to their environment, so improving a child's environment is improving a child's life. At the same time, a child's current life is the foundation for building their future personality, so parents should pay twelve points of attention to their child's environment; and especially pay attention to the child's individual preferences, provide practical help for their development; and at the same time, provide guidance for bad thoughts and correct them with a technique. But one should remove the threatening method, because the threatening method only gives children a change in their thoughts; and cannot correct the errors in their thoughts.</p>
<p>Rousseau said in his famous educational work Émile, or On Education: "Do not punish the child, do not make the child apologize; because the child does not yet know moral evil, so hitting him and punishing him are inappropriate." This sentence is enough to make us a bible for training children. In fact, when a child is doing something, he does not consider whether it should or should not be done; so for the wrong things that a child does, the child does not bear a guilty conscience. If parents rely entirely on their own subjective attitude, a perspective that has been exposed to the ways of the world, to punish a child who has not yet seen the world, it will of course not be effective. Such punishment will only leave the child with an impression of being threatened, and of course he will still not regret what he has done wrong; and in fact, he has no chance to regret it. Therefore, parents should take a benevolent approach to teaching their children about their mistakes. In other words, use the child's own environment to make him discover his previous mistakes and be subject to a kind of conscience, which will prompt him to correct his previous mistakes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility for carving a child's piece of white jade rests entirely on the parents' guidance and teaching of a good environment; and one should try to avoid the venting of one's own will as a parent; and stand in the same position as the child to seek improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e188">On the Lake of Bacheng <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>The steamer from Kunshan to Changshu passes through the first dock, which is Bacheng: Bacheng has a lake, which is called Bacheng Lake.</p>
<p>The area of the lake is not that wide. The lake is clear and lovely; the light waves are rippling, like the spring breeze blowing through the shallow grass.</p>
<p>Several boats are dotted on the south of the lake, with their oars laid aside and sails hung high; on the shallow beach, messy branches are lush and vibrant, swaying in the wind. On the other side of the lake, where black smoke rises, a steamer approaches from afar, gradually splashing waves onto our boat; thus, "Hello!" the two sides greeted each other, specially breaking the monotonous silence on the lake.</p>
<p>Looking to the horizon, green trees connect to form a large arc. In the sparse places of the branches, one or two bamboo fences and thatched huts faintly reveal a bay of roof corners: wisps of smoke, intermittently winding upwards.</p>
<p>The already bankrupt countryside, of course, is not enough for the "important people" to linger in their cars; but the inherent calmness and tranquility of the countryside—now perhaps we cannot say "happy and content"—the terror is something that the "important people" concerned with the gains and losses of chickens and insects cannot comprehend even a ten-thousandth of it!</p>
<p>To briefly mention what I know, Yangcheng Lake is famous for its crabs; West Lake has the scenic spots of Su Causeway in Spring Dawn and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, which are admired by talented scholars and beautiful women; only this Bacheng Lake is located in the countryside, and its name is not heard throughout its life. The same clear water can cleanse the mind, yet the encounters are so different, is there also luck or misfortune among them?</p>

<p>Chapter 25: Tearful Farewell to Loved Ones, Returning Home to Distant Garrison, Wind and Sand All Night Long, Setting Out to Garrison a Lonely City</p>
<p>When Zhao Ziqiang saw his situation, he also sighed and said: "Don't be a soldier, and if you are a soldier, don't get married." Tian Qing laughed and said: "Marriage!" Ziqiang said: "Rubbish! Marriage is a living worry." There were seven or eight people sitting in the company headquarters, and they all burst out laughing when they heard this. Tian Qing laughed and said: "Why are you making such a big complaint? Is there something you don't like about your beautiful wife?" Zhao Ziqiang said: "It's precisely because my wife is good that I say it's a living worry. Think about it, who wouldn't want to spend a few more days with their newlywed wife? But before I could get rid of her shyness, look, this telegram brought me back. In this way, it's nothing to me, but for a new wife, she hasn't even seen her husband's face clearly before she has to part with him. Isn't she sad?" Tian Qing laughed and said: "Old Zhao, don't say insincere words. Did your new wife really not see your face clearly?" Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said: "Even if she saw my face clearly, wouldn't it be better to be satisfied? Think about it, the biggest event in a person's life should be lived calmly. But we finished this matter in less than seven days. Who wouldn't be sad?" "Alas..." Tian Qing walked forward, patted him on the shoulder, and said: "The matter has already passed, and if she's sad, she's sad. What's the use of complaining like this? You've been here for so long, you should go see the battalion commander. I think he must have something to say to you too." Ziqiang thought, this is the right thing to do. He stood up, straightened his clothes, and walked towards the battalion headquarters. His battalion commander, Bao Fang, was standing with his hands behind his back, looking up at the sky. Suddenly, he turned around and saw Zhao Ziqiang. He smiled long ago. Ziqiang saluted and walked over. Bao Fang shook his right hand, patted his left shoulder, and said: "You are really obedient to orders. The telegram was sent, and you came right away. Is the new bride well?" (329)</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Glimpse of the Hangzhou Art Academy Exhibition <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Nanhai Seagull</p>
<p>Sunday! What to do for recreation?</p>
<p>Go hiking! In the vast Shanghai, there is not a hill in sight. Play in the water! The water of the Huangpu River is cold and turbid, unfit to wash my feet. The movie theater is crowded with dull heads; I don't have a ball to play at the sports field.</p>
<p>"Stroll on the street"! Go admire those truly "live movies."</p>
<p>Walking to the entrance of the Franco-Chinese Friendship Association on Huanlong Road, I suddenly looked up and saw the sign "National Hangzhou Art Academy Art Exhibition"! Ah! This is the "Palace of Art," the "Sports Field of Art"! I am a layman of art, but today I may as well serve as a person who ascends the hall and enters the room. The crowd ran inside, and I ran inside. The crowd signed their names, and I also signed my name. The crowd looked at the paintings, and I also learned from the method of villagers looking at notices to appreciate all the works arranged horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Among these hundreds of beauties, I admired Sun Fuxi's Chrysanthemums, Xu Zhengzhi's Dogs, Li Chaoshi's Big Doll, Bai Shishan Weng's Water Birds, Lin Fengmian's Chinese Painting Sketches, the Wax-Dyed Magpie Plum, various industrial practical design patterns, and various poses of human body sketches...</p>
<p>The works exhibited at the entire exhibition are divided into Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, pattern, pastel painting, sculpture, and photography. Pattern paintings are divided into weaving, ceramics, lacquerware, advertising, interior decoration, and architectural decoration. The artists whose works were exhibited included nineteen professors and more than two hundred students from the Art Academy. There were a total of five hundred and sixty-two works. There were indeed many visitors. The art movement, taking the West as an example, is still in its infancy in our country. An exhibition of works from one school is like this, and if it is expanded in the future to become a group movement of artists from all over the country, it will not be difficult to create a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>If someone says that I am doing "voluntary advertising" for the art exhibition, I am also worthy of introducing him to be a "free viewer"!</p>
<h3 id="e191">In a Third-Class Carriage <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Clatter... Clatter...</p>
<p>The train had been stopped at Jinhua Station impatiently. The snow, like goose down, was still flying down from outside the train window, and the huge eyes of a "dragon head" next to it emitted extremely strong light, reflecting on the raindrops on the glass window—the raindrops formed by the melting of the snowflakes, shimmering with fluorescent light. Unexpectedly, traveling by train on a snowy night would present such a more poetic picture before my eyes.</p>
<p>The ticket inspector came to the third-class carriage. A passenger in a seat near the door took out a piece of paper from the pocket of his "vest." The ticket inspector took it and only squeezed out a "roar" from his nostrils. Then, he grabbed him and pushed him towards the door... He only had a dirty outer shirt and "vest" that even a pipe worker would嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌</p>

<p>— Bibo</p>
<p>In the fields scorched by the blazing sun, old Fu Gen still craned his neck, hoping for sweet rain from the heavens to descend soon, to revive the many withered and dying seedlings; but his daily hopes ended in disappointment!</p>
<p>He didn't have the money to rent a Western water dragon pump, and was forced to brave the scorching heat, walking to a small town ten miles away to borrow money from a rice shop he had dealings with; the result was another rejection!</p>
<p>Two kinds of painful memories assailed him, coupled with feeling some summer heat, he suddenly developed acute heatstroke halfway home; luckily, his neighbor saw him and helped him back home. He was also recently widowed, with only a clever daughter, Xiaomei, and a child who was only a few years old, who were both at a loss when they saw this situation.</p>
<p>Zou Si Sao, who worked as a servant in the large household of the Jin mansion in Shanghai, and who was envied by everyone in the village for being able to earn money, happened to return home at that time. She quickly mixed the prepared heatstroke medicine with water and gave it to him to drink, and sure enough, he gradually got better.</p>
<p>After a conversation, Si Sao unexpectedly lent the water dragon rental fee to Fu Gen without conditions, and also agreed to take Xiaomei to work together when she went to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The typical lifestyle of pleasure-seekers in the city was, of course, something Xiaomei, who had just left her village, could not have dreamed of; but Fu Gen was unable to pay off his debts because of the abundant autumn harvest and the drastically low rice prices, and with no other way, he had to write a letter to Xiaomei; but Xiaomei, however, had been targeted by the Jin family's second young master, who was just worrying about how to make his move, and seized this opportunity to coerce Xiaomei into selling her virginity.</p>
<p>It was not a big deal for young masters to take a fancy to a maid, but Xiaomei was still foolishly hoping that the master would fulfill his promise to marry her, because she was already pregnant.</p>
<p>Not long after, the second young master, who had once ravaged the village girl, was engaged to a so-called refined young lady; at that time, Xiaomei was tricked and intimidated by the master and mistress, and had to return to the fields with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Old Fu Gen was a man who cared a lot about face. When he saw his daughter and learned the truth, he fell ill with anger and died soon after; Xiaomei also gave birth to an adorable child during this period of grief.</p>
<p>In a closed-off village with rigid customs, people couldn't stand this kind of thing, and they all used Xiaomei raising an illegitimate child as gossip, spreading it everywhere. A kind of contemptuous and unbearable satire was more painful than poisonous arrows; at the same time, the Jin family, holding the grand theory that aristocratic blood could not be left outside, ordered their servants and Si Sao to entice and coerce Xiaomei, snatching away the child she regarded as her only lifeline.</p>
<p>In the process of unspeakable sorrow, Xiaomei took her younger brother to Shanghai to find her enemy, the second young master, but coincidentally ran into him in the car in front of the gate. He not only denied everything, but also sternly ordered the gatekeeper to drive her away. At this inextricable moment, her younger brother, who was casually looking at the scenery on the road, was knocked down by another car; at this moment, Xiaomei was heartbroken, but couldn't cry, and just stared blankly at the iron gate of the Jin mansion.</p>

<p>Philippines Selects Chiavia et al.</p>
<p>Japan, Though Represented by Sato, Hyotaro, et al.</p>
<p>Still Possesses Strong Strength and Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games this summer are scheduled to be held in Manila in mid-May. The Philippines and Japan have already decided on some of their athletes. China still needs to wait for the National Sports Advancement Association's board meeting this Saturday before making specific arrangements. However, the preliminary selection date will definitely be in mid-April. Basketball preliminary selections are very active in North China. Japan has already decided on its basketball, volleyball, and tennis team members. According to Shen Siliang, honorary director of the Sports Association, China's tennis team will no longer hold preliminary selections and will directly send Qiu Feihai, Lin Baohua, and Xu Xinji to represent the country. According to news from the Philippines, they have also decided on Chiavia and Anben for singles, and Chiavia and Holly Sidan for doubles. Their doubles strength is particularly strong. Chiavia came to Shanghai last autumn, but it has been a year since then, and he should be regarded with new eyes. This time, Japan will be represented by second-rate players such as Sato Hyotaro et al., and may be able to put up a fight, but their strength is still strong and should not be underestimated.</p>

<p>Granted Emergency Powers</p>
<p>(Wuxi Dispatch) In order to strictly rectify education and improve efficiency, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has implemented mutual inspection and guidance among county supervisors in each county, and granted county supervisors emergency powers. The ten counties of Xishan, Wuxi, Yushan, Yixing, Licheng, Jingjiang, Jintan, Wuxian, and Wujiang form the Second Normal School District. The Provincial Department of Education has separately stipulated the mutual inspection and guidance of supervisors. Yesterday, the "Joint Meeting of the Second Normal School District's Zonal Inspection and Guidance and the Second Normal School District's Primary School Education Research Association" was held in the Wuxi Provincial Normal School conference room. More than twenty people attended, including county supervisors from the ten counties such as Sun Youguang, Xu Wenlan, Pan Jishan, and Shen Xanzhi. The chairman was Shen Peixian. Many important proposals were passed. Regarding the emergency treatment measures, it was also discussed and decided to have Song Yunsun draft a form to be submitted to the Provincial Department for reporting, so that it can be applied. As for the three supervisors who were transferred to Wuxi for inspection and guidance, Xu Zaofei from Qingpu, Hu Chaolun from Jiangyin, and Xu Shaolie from Kunshan, have already arrived in Wuxi. The two county supervisors from this county who were transferred to Wuxian for inspection and guidance, Song Yunsun and Shen Xanzhi, are scheduled to depart today. This mutual inspection and guidance is scheduled to end on June 15th. Another inspection and guidance meeting will be held on July 5th to discuss all the reforms and improvements in the education of each county after the mutual inspection and guidance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent inspectors to inspect higher education in Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, Baoding, Kaifeng, Wuhan, Changsha, and Anqing. Except for Zhou Tianfang, who is waiting in Beiping for all the members to arrive and inspect together, and Hao Gengsheng, who will participate in the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee on the 14th and rush to Beiping on the 15th and 16th to join the inspection, the remaining members are waiting for the Ministry of Education to designate someone to inspect medicine before departing together. The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 5th to appoint Pang Jingzhou to inspect medical education together with the members, and the Secretariat sent letters on the 5th to specialized schools or education bureaus above the specialized level in Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, Baoding, Kaifeng, Wuhan, Changsha, and Anqing, explaining that the Ministry of Education had sent the members to inspect and asking them to investigate. It is said that Chen Kezhong, Guo Youshou, Sun Guofeng, Liu Yingshi, Pang Jingzhou, etc., left Pukou by train for Jinan on the morning of the 6th. The members are scheduled to start inspecting in Jinan today (7th). This inspection will cover all schools above the specialized level, whether public or private, and whether or not they have been registered. There are especially many schools in Beiping, about twenty schools. According to the Ministry of Education's deadline, it is limited to one month and a few days, but in reality, in order to achieve comprehensive and serious inspection, the deadline may need to be slightly extended.</p>
<h3 id="e205">A Glimpse of the Shandong Provincial Education Inspection Report <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Report by Ministry of Education Specialist Guo Youshou</p>
<p>Ministry of Education specialist Guo Youshou previously inspected Shandong Province's education and has now prepared a report and submitted it to the Ministry of Education. The original report is divided into twelve chapters (1. Introduction, 2. Educational Administration, 3. Educational Funding, 4. Kindergarten Education, 5. Primary School Education, 6. Secondary School Education, 7. Normal School Education, 8. Vocational Education, 9. Social Education, 10. Zouping County Education, 11. Recommendations, 12. Appendix). The text is very long. Here is an excerpt from the introduction, which can also give a glimpse of Shandong Province's education. The introduction roughly states that in 1928, Shandong underwent a major change in the course of history. The tide of the National Revolution, along with the National Revolutionary Army, arrived in Shandong, and the reform of all social undertakings began, especially the most significant changes in education. Since its establishment, the Department of Education has lasted for five and a half years. In the first year, Jinan and Jiaodong were still in the hands of the Japanese, and the northwest was filled with bandits. The provincial government was entrenched in Tai'an. In order to establish a foundation for party-state education, the Department of Education strived to restore the damaged school buildings and gather the scattered students, and the regulations were organized and innovated, roughly forming a rudimentary framework. Around April of 1930, Shandong suffered war again, and the provincial government moved east to Qingdao. The education of all counties in the province returned to the path of destruction. The foundation of two years of effort was suddenly interrupted. After the recovery of Jinan, reconstruction was restarted. In the past three years, considerable results have been achieved in the continued fundraising and auditing of provincial and county education funds (in 1933, the provincial education fund was 3,031,399 yuan, an increase of 112,534 yuan compared to the previous year. Each year from 1930 to 1931 gradually increased. In 1933, the county education funds, excluding Heze and Zouping counties, which have been changed to experimental counties (Zouping 86,626 yuan last year, Heze 193,009 yuan), the remaining 106 counties totaled 4,364,339 yuan in annual education funds. Shandong's education funds were extremely chaotic before 1928. After the establishment of the Department of Education, active rectification was carried out and open methods were adopted. In the past five or six years, the results have been remarkable. Education funds have maintained their independence. Other matters, such as formulating a unified system, clearing up assets, and auditing and supervising, are too numerous to mention, sweeping away the old bad habits. Schools are no longer regarded as sources of profit, and the management of education funds has entered a normal track), the establishment of provincial and county rural normal schools, the overall planning of the establishment of middle schools, the promotion of compulsory education, and the improvement of social education have all achieved considerable results. Youshou was dispatched to Shandong in October 1933 to inspect, which lasted for a month, passing through Jinan City, and 14 counties including Taian, Qufu, Ziyang, Jining, Qihe, Pingyuan, Dexian, Zhangqiu, Zouping, Changshan, Yidu, Linzi, Huangxian, and Fushan. Among the provincial schools, I inspected eight middle schools, four normal schools, three rural normal schools and vocational schools each, three provincial social education institutions, and also inspected eight private middle schools, four county middle schools, one rural normal school, four normal school training institutes, three vocational supplementary schools, about 60 provincial, municipal/district, and private primary schools and kindergartens, and more than ten local education administration and social education institutions (omitted below).</p>

<p>Anhui Education Director Yang Lian recently requested a ten-day leave from the provincial government, and took a ship to Beijing on the afternoon of the 2nd, in a hurry, saying that he had important official business to report to the Ministry. According to reliable information, Yang's trip to Beijing was due to a sudden onset of a strange disease where his mouth was slanted to the left, so he went to Beijing for medical treatment. It is said that Yang had been working too hard in Anhui, and often took walks in the suburbs during his free time. A few days ago, he was accidentally blown by a strong wind, which suddenly caused his mouth to slant to the left. There were no famous doctors in Anhui, so he requested leave to go to Beijing to consult the Central Hospital. It is said that this disease is very strange and may not be able to recover for a while. Although Yang's mouth is crooked, his spirit is still normal.</p>

<p>Improving Educational Publications - The Department of Education originally published a semi-monthly "Education Semi-Monthly" and a quarterly "Education Quarterly," but the handling was not very energetic. After revising the methods, the semi-monthly publication was discontinued and changed to a bi-weekly publication, and the quarterly publication was also discontinued and changed to a monthly publication. This has already been done.</p>
<p>Cautious Disbursement of Education Funds - In addition to collecting school fees, middle schools in Anhui Province also collect library fees and sports fees. Most schools do not report the use of these funds to the Department, resulting in a lack of oversight. The Department of Education issued a notice to all schools yesterday stating that in the future, separate accounts must be established for library and sports fees, and reports must be submitted to the Department for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Following the Oriental Library, the Hongying Library is Actively Preparing <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Plans to Open for Trial Operation This Autumn Before the New Building is Constructed</p>
<p>Selecting Historical Materials, Currently Has One Million Items, 40,000 Books</p>
<p>Social Sciences, Especially History, is the Core of the Library</p>
<p>After the Site is Decided, a Public Library Will Also Be Attached</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Songhu War, China's greatest Oriental Library was destroyed, and people at home and abroad have expressed regret. Now, industrialist Ye Hongying has donated a large sum of money to accept the Humanities Library, which was being prepared by the Humanities Society, and established the Hongying Library. Its scale cannot be compared with the Oriental Library, but it focuses on selecting historical materials and collecting a vast amount of resources, which is unprecedented in Shanghai. The preparation process and implementation plan are described below:</p>
<p>Source of the Library's Name - The Hongying Library is receiving the Humanities Library of the Humanities Society. The Humanities Society was formerly known as the Jiazi Society. It was initiated and organized by Huang Renzhi, Ma Junqing, Shi Liangcai, and others in July 1924. Part of its work was dedicated to selecting historical materials, called "Humanities Series." In March 1925, it established a location on Jing'an Temple Road and began work. Funding was donated independently by Ma Junqing. In 1927 and 1928, the scope was temporarily reduced. In March 1929, with the help of Qian Xinzhi and Xu Jingren, the plan was revived. In addition to historical materials, it also engaged in compiling magazine indexes, publishing monthly magazines and series, and preparing for the Humanities Library. In March 1931, the society's sixth annual meeting resolved to officially name it the Humanities Society and elected Qian Xinzhi and others as standing committee members. In 1932, it planned to build a library building. According to the resolution of the seventh annual meeting, the budget for land purchase and construction fees and funds was 400,000 yuan, and it was stipulated that if a private individual made an independent donation, the library would be named after that person. Ye Hongying happened to visit the society and deeply approved of it. Subsequently, the Hongying Education Fund was initiated, donating 500,000 yuan in cash. After deducting 100,000 yuan for the rural primary school fund, 400,000 yuan was specifically used for the library fund. The board of directors of the fund resolved that on April 3, 1933, Ye Hongying, Cai Yuanpei, Qian Xinzhi, Shen Enfu, Huang Yanpei, and others exchanged documents, and on June 7, personnel were dispatched to take inventory, and the name was changed to Hongying Library.</p>
<p>Library Construction Plan - The library focuses on social sciences, with history as the core of social sciences. It first collects as much as possible about modern history and its historical materials. The preparation office is currently located on Avenue Joffre...</p>

Standards for Publicly Funded Students.</p>
<p>It is proposed that half of the funds be used for the construction of a library and equipment, with the address proposed to be in the western section of the French Concession or near Hongqiao Road, which has not yet been determined. After the location of the library is decided, a public library will be established in the nearby area, dedicated to the public for reading. It is now decided by the preparatory office to open the library for trial operation at the current location before the new building is constructed, which is expected to be around the turn of summer and autumn. The office is divided into four departments: administrative affairs, historical materials, publishing, and library &amp; indexing. The selected historical materials, from the Xinhai Revolution to the present day, total 939,824 items; books and magazines total 42,200 volumes; charts and diagrams, 155 pieces; and abstracts index of magazines and newspapers, 100,9682 items.</p>
<p>Trial Opening Method: Since the Preparatory Office of the Hongying Library moved to the newly rented house on Xiafei Road, the house has a lawn in front, with fresh air and a quiet environment, suitable for reading. On the one hand, land is being purchased and constructed in an orderly manner, and on the other hand, it is planned to open for trial operation first to meet the public's expectations. The methods are as follows: (1) Six or eight temporary houses in the style of barracks will be built on the west side of the lawn, and the books, magazines, and historical materials on the lower floor will be moved into them successively, vacating the lower floor houses for open reading of books. These temporary houses can be dismantled and moved for use after the new building is completed; (2) After the temporary houses are built, the historical materials will be moved first, vacating half a room for use. When there are gradually more readers, the books and magazines will be moved into the temporary houses together for full use; (3) The opening method adopts a limited opening. Those who want to read books must first obtain a book reading certificate according to the corresponding procedures. The procedures and format of the book reading certificate will be determined separately; (4) The historical materials are being sorted out. At this time, work is being stepped up. It is necessary to wait until the review and editing are completed and the materials are bound before they can be opened with extremely careful procedures. It is not convenient to open them for public reading at this time, but with the introduction of people related to this office, those who request to read them through special procedures as usual are not subject to this rule; (5) The existing books and magazines, including donations, total more than 42,000 volumes as of the end of January. There are quite a few magazines among them, and most of the books are biased towards general knowledge, which is still not enough for practical application. It is found that the original plan for the library, which had been approved, stipulated a book purchase fee of 30,000 yuan. If it is decided to open at this time, the quantity should be specified, and the scope should still be in accordance with the approved plan, with social sciences as the scope and the history category in social sciences as the core. Detailed methods for purchasing books will be determined separately; (6) The opening time should be based on the completion of the sorting out of the existing books. After this method is approved, work should be accelerated, which will probably have to wait until summer or early autumn before it can be opened. Additional personnel will be added to prepare for the opening, and temporary expenses will be increased. The budget will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Rules for Donating Books: The rules for donating books and documents to the office are as follows: (1) All those who sympathize with this office and are willing to donate books or documents will be handled by this office in accordance with the rules; (2) All books or documents that are reviewed to have historical material properties and do not violate the following items will be gladly preserved by this office: A. Those that meet the needs of this office; B. Those that are suitable for preservation by this office; (3) After receiving the donated books and documents, this office will issue a receipt to the donor for safekeeping; (4) The donor may apply to this office for the recovery of the donated books and documents as needed, and return the receipt. This office may also terminate the donation as needed or deem it unsuitable for preservation, and apply to the donor for the recovery and return of the receipt; (5) This office shall do its best to protect the donated books and documents, but this does not apply to irresistible facts such as natural disasters and man-made disasters; (6) For those who donate books or documents, this office will send a letter of thanks and give a publication to the donor as appropriate. They may also come to this office to request to inspect books or archives as needed, in order to reward their kindness.</p>

<p>The customs of the abandoned lunar New Year are unique and far from the Central Plains</p>
<p>Excellent materials obtained in the field of anthropology</p>
<p>The Hainan Biological Science Collection Team, organized by the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute of Peiping, the Museum of Natural History of the Academia Sinica, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, and Shandong University, Peking University, etc., departed from Shanghai in mid-January and then met with the Guangdong Geological Survey Institute in Guangzhou, and went to Hainan together. They arrived safely on Qiong Island at the beginning of last month. According to the person in charge of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, who spoke to a Shanghai reporter, a letter was recently received from Mr. Wang Yikang, the captain of the sea team of the team, stating that the land team arrived in Yansheng on February 7. Yansheng is located on the southern foot of Wuzhi Mountain, in the very center of Qiong Island, and is an important place on Qiong Island. After the abandoned lunar New Year's Day, they immediately engaged in the investigation of land products. Because Qiong Island is located in a remote part of Hainan, adheres to old customs, and attaches great importance to celebrating the abandoned lunar New Year, all projects are suspended, so it is impossible to work immediately. However, excellent materials were obtained in the field of anthropological research at this time. The customs of the abandoned lunar New Year are unique and far from the North and South of the Yangtze River. The Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has also recently allocated 500 yuan to assist the investigation in the field of anthropology. The sea team is stationed in Haikou and also needs to wait until after the abandoned lunar New Year's Day before it can carry out hunting. Generally, they have been working hard for the past month. Mr. Wang's letter also stated that the team's mailing address is Hainan Bookstore, Bo'ai Road, Haikou, Qiongzhou. Those who want to inquire about them from the outside can directly send letters to that address.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China Pays Attention to the Investigation of Native Products <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Government Economic Commission sends a letter requesting clarification on fish species</p>
<p>The Biological Society of Beijing Middle Schools plans to hold public lectures</p>
<p>The Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China in Nanjing has been established for ten years. All staff members of the institute are Chinese, and they have been studying diligently and have achieved outstanding results. More than 100 of their published papers have attracted considerable attention from foreign academic institutions. However, they have never engaged in publicity, so people in China are not very aware of them. Since the institute held a public exhibition last month, visitors have been amazed by their efforts. The institute's work pays the most attention to the investigation of native products, but it is constrained by financial resources and cannot be developed to the fullest extent. The construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces often have troubles, and they often use the fact that there are not many personnel to avoid sharing their time and effort to serve the provinces. Recently, the Economic Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Government sent an official letter to them, requesting them to clarify the types of fish in Jiangxi and their producing areas. The institute has already sent a reply, and sent several publications, stating that although the fish species in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been slightly investigated, due to the lack of financial and human resources, they have not been able to conduct a detailed investigation. What is known about Jiangxi Province is even less. If convenience can be provided in the future, specialists will be sent to conduct a detailed investigation. It is also heard that the Biology Teaching and Research Association of Nanjing Middle Schools plans to invite researchers from the institute to hold regular public lectures, which has been accepted, and the schedule is currently being planned, and it will be implemented soon.</p>

The Trade Union of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry, based on the resolution of the representative conference, advises the factory and limits a satisfactory reply within a week, otherwise, it will decide to go on strike collectively according to the resolution of the conference. The following is an excerpt from its letter to the factory: "The British-American Workers' Children's School has been reorganized since last year, with three parties jointly operating it, and six agreements have been established for joint compliance. How could it be known that before the ink was dry, the factory violated its credit and arbitrarily and unreasonably interfered in the school's administration, overstepping the scope, causing disputes, resulting in the failure to officially start classes from last year until now, abandoning the studies of thousands of workers' children, and arousing the public anger of all workers, the situation is serious. It is the duty of our union to be unable to remain silent. We think that the factory's recent measures may not be the company's original intention, but rather the mismanagement of the person in charge of the factory, which has made the relationship between labor and capital increasingly deteriorated. (Omission) In order to take care of the friendship between the two sides, we dare not give advice. We sincerely hope to give a practical reply within a week, otherwise, our union will not be responsible for any storm that may occur in the future."</p>

The investigation and verification took a long time. It has recently been published and is divided into three parts, from the first class of graduates of Nango in 1917 to the sixth class of graduates of Zhongda in 1933. The names, nicknames, native places, service institutions, and contact addresses are all recorded in detail. The binding is exquisite, and it is easy to carry.

<h3 id="e224">On Suicide <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Biyan</p>
<p>"The best fruits are often the first to rot!" Excellent young people often fail to achieve anything, and clever children are difficult to raise to adulthood - this is probably true based on human experience.</p>
<p>In modern times, many young people commit suicide. What are the reasons? Economic oppression, failed love, or seeing through the world of mortals… What are the methods? Several suicide notes, or taking poison, or throwing oneself into the river, or lying on the railway tracks… What are the results? Rescued, or really died!</p>
<p>People who are deliberately forced to death do not count. Those who commit suicide voluntarily are truly lamentable! Broadly speaking, those who are alive may not be happy to die, so it is still mostly due to the environment that forces them to die, and perhaps mostly intentional. Many old people spare no effort to inflict fatal injuries on the new youth simply because they cannot get used to them or feel that they are in the way. The elimination of many young people under the age of twenty in the past seven or eight years is clear evidence. What's more, there were female students bleeding to death in front of the Beijing government. Then these responsibilities have those who bear them. There has always been "a wrong has a head, and a debt has an owner." If people are forced to death, they may receive retribution on themselves or their children and grandchildren. Cause and effect are never false, especially in matters of life and death, which are believable.</p>
<p>The remaining causes of suicide are few. The orchid burns itself to give light, the ointment consumes itself to give light, rushing around, without a moment of peace, ending with an unresolved end, like Wang Guowei, then the reason is that he lost "too much truth," and took life too seriously! Or after a setback or repeated setbacks, all thoughts are ashes, and the spirit entrusted to it dies first, then the remaining shell of the body is regarded as not worth cherishing, and death is regarded as returning home. The reason is that it lost "too much fragility," like Ai Xia, unable to withstand wind and rain, like tender spring flowers. Many spring flower-like children have withered like this.</p>
<p>In the vast sea of people, the feelings of life and death are endlessly connected, and the suicide of a few young people is truly like losing a hair from nine oxen. But for the future of the entire society, it is clearly a sign, which shows that Chinese youth share the joys and sorrows of the world and also suffer from the era's diseases, feeling pain and wandering. Although it is decadent, it is already an expression of strength, just as women who are poisoned by "wallpaper" must have pain and a future birth, although we do not know at all what the trends of this era and what will be produced in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e225">He Jiahuai's Creative Problems <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw Mr. He Jiahuai's "About My Creation" article in this publication. The article was well written; however, the facts it provides still need to be discussed. The scavenger article that Mr. He mentioned was published in the recent "Culture Train"; the scavenger does indeed have another identity. Although I know it, I am not convenient to announce it here. If necessary or even in legal trouble, someone will be responsible. The scavenger is a pseudonym of my friend, but the news he released was originally heard from my mouth, so I can't help but be responsible for this matter. It is not to defend the scavenger, but now that things have come to this point, I have to make the facts I know public.</p>
<p>Mr. He and I have never known each other, so it is understandable that there is no grievance or hatred. I have no intention of antagonizing Mr. He at all, and now I have no choice but to come forward.</p>
<p>I first heard about the suspicion of Mr. He's creation last summer in Nanjing on a certain evening near Houhu. The speaker was Chu Anping (a friend of both Mr. He and Mr. Xu); besides me, Gao Zhi was also listening. Anping said: "He Jiahuai and Xu Zhuanpeng's novels are unclear. Sometimes the original manuscript is written with Xu Zhuanpeng's name, but the published magazine changes it to He Jiahuai." He gave an example of the title at the time, but unfortunately I forgot. Because it was just idle talk, I didn't pay much attention to it, and I hadn't met Zhuanpeng at that time, so the matter passed.</p>
<p>Later, as I became more familiar with Zhuanpeng, I occasionally talked about this matter. At first, Zhuanpeng denied it, but from the expression in his reply, it could be seen that he was pretending. After asking more questions, he finally admitted it. Originally, it was just a joke out of curiosity, but after it was proven to be true, I felt very uncomfortable in my heart. I was not only dissatisfied with Mr. He, but also very unhappy with Zhuanpeng, because although there are many scandals in the Shanghai literary world, such things are rare.</p>
<p>"How many articles are there in total?" I asked Zhuanpeng.</p>
<p>"Probably about ten, you could say it's all my works from 1932," Zhuanpeng replied.</p>
<p>This proves even more that the fault is not entirely on Mr. He alone. If it is one or two articles, it is understandable out of friendship. But if there are as many as ten, it is too outrageous. At that time, I scolded Zhuanpeng unceremoniously and asked him not to ask for this kind of thing again in the future. (However, Zhuanpeng has another explanation, describing the whole story, but I am not convenient to disclose it now without Zhuanpeng's permission.)</p>
<p>"Then how did Anping know about this?" I asked.</p>
<p>"This matter is probably not known to Anping alone," Zhuanpeng said. "I'm afraid Shen Congwen, Shi Zhecun, and Shao Xunmei all know about it, because I gave one of my articles to Congwen to revise first, and he revised a lot, but when it was published, it became He Jiahuai's name; often articles were first submitted to "Modern" and "New Moon," written with my name, but after being taken back and published in other magazines, the name was changed again."</p>
<p>But Zhuanpeng's guess was wrong, because the editors couldn't pay that much attention. When I had the chance to ask Zhecun, he said he didn't know.</p>
<p>I have to take responsibility. This news was inadvertently told by me, and the scavenger's article came from this.</p>
<p>In me, there is no intention to make enemies with Mr. He, and Mr. He is still a new writer. If I announced it as if it were a big deal, I was afraid it would be detrimental to Mr. He, so I once told Zhuanpeng to clear up this matter secretly, return the things to their original owner, and then no one would speak again. Zhuanpeng was also quite eager to get the articles back, encouraged by his friends, but he was finally too embarrassed to deal with Mr. He directly, only saying that he would slowly think of a way. Recently, he returned to his hometown and wrote me a letter, pointing out Du Heng, Zhecun, Cunren and I to handle this matter on his behalf, and said that on his side, I have "full authority", which is really a difficult problem. Please think, how can this kind of pro bono lawyer do it!</p>
<p>Together with Cunren, I ran to the Modern Bookstore and talked with Du Heng and Zhecun. The result of the discussion was that the publication of Mr. He's collection of creations "Rainy Day," which was being printed at the Modern Bookstore, was temporarily suspended, and Zhuanpeng was asked to write a letter to Modern, clearly listing his own works and extracting them. However, it has been half a month since this resolution was notified to Zhuanpeng, and his letter has not yet arrived. Probably this public figure is hesitating again. Then, if I, the pro bono lawyer with "full authority," loses the plaintiff as well, and becomes a legal person myself, how can this lawsuit be fought? Now Mr. He himself has come forward to ask people, implicating a scavenger, and I have to provide the whole story as above.</p>
<p>As for Mr. He's explanation of his creation in the article "About My Creation," I think it's a bit of bragging; his so-called (1) tight layout, (2) detailed description, (3) very careful use of words and sentences, are very appropriate criticisms of Zhuanpeng's novels, which he himself does not have at all. Mr. He is too thick-skinned. Among the masterpieces he considers satisfactory, such as "Drawing Water" and "Release from Prison," it is clear that they are Zhuanpeng's works. Does this still require critics to come forward to research and analyze them? Fortunately, the original manuscripts of Zhuanpeng's creations are all preserved, and they can be printed out when necessary.</p>
<p>But we always hope that Mr. He can bravely admit his mistakes, return the things to their original owner, and work hard from now on, or there will still be infinite hope for the future; otherwise, if he only cares about the present and argues arbitrarily, and the matter is therefore publicized, then he will be even more despised.</p>

<p>— Xia Chang</p>
<p>(Nine)</p>
<p>I have repeatedly mentioned courtesy articles such as epitaphs. Recently, I read an article by Qiao Bo, satirizing epitaphs, and the language is extremely humorous. Its meaning is: "When writing epitaphs for people, the seeker will not be satisfied if the deeds are not filled in; the viewer will not believe it if the deeds are filled in too much. When there is nothing to say, I have no choice but to copy excerpts and various editions to respond. It's like taking a portrait from the face of a dead person, which is not enough to resemble, let alone writing the appearance of a passerby? I hope that people in the world will do some good deeds and be good people before they die, so that those who write epitaphs will hesitate to write and cover up for them." Making people for the sake of the glory of the epitaph, this kind of satire can be said to be wishful thinking.</p>
<p>(Ten)</p>
<p>Today's authors mostly write creative experiences, and there are not many good ones among them. Most of them praise themselves, and some even take it as an honor to ask others to write such articles, thinking that it is a good opportunity to show off. I really dare not praise a word. Xu Rijiuyun: "I still remember twenty years ago, when I was extremely distressed, unable to live or die, writing all day, worrying all day, and living all day. I didn't dare to show the article to others, and my face turned red when I showed it to others, thinking that it was unbearable to be trivialized, and it was also unbearable to be praised. Or, unfortunately, to be caught by those who talk about exaggeration, it is even more unbearable. But today's speakers and writers in the world do not first measure their abilities, and externally measure the lovableness of others, deceive their hearts and create karma, and praise their predecessors, but in fact, they don't even know that they have fallen into the ghost country, which is also pitiful." Like this kind of frank spirit and angry accusation, I really don't know how many times I have seen it in our writers' self-reports, although there are also such people.</p>
<p>(Ten)(One)</p>
<p>Someone is named Huang Huanghe, and Zhou Baian humorously joked with him: "The Yellow Crane Tower is named after the immortal picking orange peel into a crane and dancing. The Yellow Crane Peak is named after the peak being full of pine flowers and the crane's back being yellow. Sir, are you made of orange peel, or are you covered with pine flowers? One of the two is too empty. I'm afraid that the empty hunger will kill the gentleman who wants to get on the crane's back." The language is quite interesting.</p>

<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Stepping into the room, my wife looked at me silently, as if there was something to say, but couldn't say it for a while.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but be silent.</p>
<p>After a while, my wife lowered her head, and then raised her head to look at me again:</p>
<p>"Have you packed your things?"</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else you want?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>I replied slowly, looking at my wife's face: extremely sad! She sat on the edge of the bed, her dark eyes always reluctantly looking at me. This made me feel the pain of parting too!</p>
<p>I lowered my head, wanting to say something to comfort her. However, I couldn't say a word! The room was silent and a little desolate.</p>
<p>After a while, my wife asked me with a choked voice: "After you leave tomorrow, when will you be able to come back?..."</p>
<p>"I can come back anytime." I suppressed the sadness in my heart and joked with my wife as usual.</p>
<p>My wife barely forced a bitter smile:</p>
<p>"Really come back any day? You don't think about how sad I am when you are outside! You are so cruel!"</p>
<p>I deliberately teased my wife:</p>
<p>"I go out to help people... I have to suffer people's anger and be scolded by people. That's what's sad! What's sad about you at home?"</p>
<p>My wife looked bitter and sighed a long sigh:</p>
<p>"Who knows my suffering?... Alas, I really don't like to be separated from you often, but what can I do? After you leave, I'm all alone, having to manage the house and busy with the work in the vegetable garden, think about it...!" "Then, I won't go out, I'll stay home with you, okay?"</p>
<p>"No, you have to go out!" My wife glanced at me: "However, don't be like you were in previous years, coming home with a mess of debt. The family still owes people money, and I still owe Third Sister a stone of grain!"</p>
<p>Listening to my wife's words, I silently faced the half-bright and half-dim dying lamp, and I was just thinking in my heart: How can I not come home with a mess of debt?</p>
<p>Without my noticing, my wife secretly shed tears!</p>

<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>Although there are hundreds of thousands of generals commanding the army on the front line, they have become frightened birds, with no contact at all. The lifeline of transportation has been completely cut off. The front line is empty. The front line only has hundreds of thousands of meat-made bullets.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cars, carriages, rickshaws, pushcarts, water carts, ox carts... even people and camels in the city were requisitioned overnight, and they were loaded with pancakes, dry steamed buns, artillery shells, and bullets... and set off to the front line together. This long transport team composed of civilians, carriages, water carts, and camels, viewed from above from a high altitude, may gradually form a "丁" shape with the Great Wall of the north. The top stroke of the "丁" was built with the fat and bones of the people thousands of years ago. Now, the bottom stroke of the "丁" is driving thousands of lives to pile up. We don't know when the violent aggressors will disappear or never disappear, but this Great Wall, no matter what it is built of, has permanently become a tragic and generous record in the history of our nation. It may one day be taken away from the increasingly decadent and weak by the violent aggressor, but the bricks and stones on the city, which have been stained and soaked with the blood, sweat and spirit of our ancestors, its glory will forever shine in this world.</p>
<p>On the first day of the departure of the civilian and camel transport team, they saw earthen houses and withered trees. On the second day, they saw collapsed houses and burnt trees. On the third day, they saw dead mules and horses and human corpses. On the road, there was white snow left over from winter that had not yet melted, and it was also mixed with the bright red blood of people that seemed to have just flowed out... It had already frozen into pieces... The winding Great Wall was right in front of them. Over there, the daytime was covered with pitch-black smoke, and the night was filled with blood-like flames. The enemy's planes, like flocks of mountain birds, circled around the horizon, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes near, sometimes far. The sound was extremely deafening. With the sound of the planes, countless black dots fell down. Each black dot was a bomb weighing more than two hundred pounds. The booming sound, the bursting sound, the wasteland became its broadcasting field, and the valley became a very accurate echo machine.</p>
<p>Pieces of clothing, pieces of stone, pieces of meat... immediately burst and flew up, and turned into countless and countless small black dots. The coming of these black dots, the going of those black dots. The so-called justice and salute of war is just a momentary illusion left in this miserable space.</p>
<p>Countless small black dots still returned to the ground, and then flowers painted red and white with people's brains and blood bloomed on the ground.</p>
<p>The transport team composed of civilians and camels was soon scattered by those flocks of "mountain birds." They ran everywhere, trampling on the ice and snow, trampling on human blood. Steamed buns, pancakes, artillery shells and bullets were all abandoned along the way. The soldiers in the trenches were still holding their guns empty-handed, holding a handful of blood-stained snow when they were thirsty; gnawing on a piece of dry food that had already frozen into ice when they were hungry.</p>
<p>Our soldiers are frozen and starving in the snow, in the blood. What are they waiting for? The order of the superior: only defense is allowed, no offense is allowed, so wait, flocks of mountain birds came to "lay eggs" again, and they feasted on these things, dying in the snow, dying in the blood.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of troops were living sacrifices to enemy planes; countless people became victims. Mountains, ponds, cities... in a short period of time, they all changed color completely!</p>
<p>The Chinese planes that we were looking forward to in our dreams, really took off creaking in the air one day at dawn. The people of the whole city were encouraged and joyful, but it didn't take long for them to fall silent again.</p>
<p>The general had already fled on his own plane.</p>
<p>From that time onwards, except for the fact that the security zone was particularly prosperous, the rest of the place was almost covered with a deathly silence. After being silent for more than a month, it is now prosperous everywhere again, and the degree of prosperity is almost impossible to count...</p>

<h3 id="e230">Gold Price Rises Another Six Yuan <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Night Market Silver Price Reported to Fall, Rumors of US Raising Gold Price are Uncertain</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday. The news turned better, with exciting rumors already breaking through the 50 yuan mark. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the US shrink. The futures silver price at the Gold Exchange shrank by 3.2 to 4.5%. Exchange rates fell slightly, London raw gold fell by a fraction of a penny, US cotton rose slightly, and US wheat shrank slightly. The fur market opened and rose to 46-47 yuan, gradually rising to nine yuan. As it trended higher, there was supply, so it retreated slightly. After the opening, due to the exchange market trending loose, Sassoon was selling sterling, and the market situation was mostly sluggish with multiple orders, lacking self-sustaining power. The Central Bank opened spot trading, which was still able to support it. Under the struggle, the heart was firm instead, and sellers in the exchange market retreated. There was quite a surge in replenishing orders in the market. Although the Dalian gang came to supply, it was no match for the buying exceeding the selling, so the gold price gradually rose, and it even broke through the 50 yuan mark at noon. However, the New York night market silver price was reported to fall. The market only fluctuated around 50 yuan inside and outside in the later market, and the market situation was stable. There was very little Reuters news during the day, and the Associated Press said that rumors of the US government raising the gold price to prevent a sharp drop in prices were difficult to confirm, which caused people's hearts to turn firm. The Central Bank opened more than 300 taels, which were made by Yinfeng, Hengtai, Kangrun, Tongfeng, Yongfeng, etc. The opening price in the forenoon was 949 yuan, and the later market was heard to be 52 yuan.

<p>Market Transactions Still Not Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank loan rate for foreign currency in the market was still borrowed, and the transaction of interbank loan bills gradually increased. It is estimated that the morning session had over 3.2 million in transfer accounts, over 500,000 in new transactions, and over 300,000 in the Small General Association's transactions. As for the market price for cash settlement, the noon session has not yet started, so only a two- to three-tenths market was made in the Small General Association. The news of bank collections and deliveries was also slack yesterday. Foreign banks collected and delivered over 1.4 million in bank drafts, and over 3 million in various goods, foreign exchange collateral, and miscellaneous funds. 400,000 went into storage. Chinese banks collected and delivered over 1.89 million in bank drafts, and over 4.5 million in various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds. 500,000 went out of storage.

<h3 id="e234">Securities and Twenty-Two Customs Tariff Fall Sharply <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>| Other Areas Also Weak and Listless |</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market continued to be in a state of sluggish trading. Market sentiment was extremely sluggish, with supply exceeding demand. In addition, the rush to sell No. 46 and No. 48 twenty-two-year customs tariffs made people feel even more uncertain. Judging from the situation of the market hovering and brewing, it seemed to have a trend of turning smaller. Although the salt tax once approached 53 yuan four times in the morning, it still did not break through. However, the amount of its pullback was also very limited. Therefore, the surface weakness was combined with firmness, evolving into a hovering situation. For the time being, there may not be any major storms, but if the hovering lasts too long, its changes will inevitably be relatively large. Yesterday's transactions were still sluggish, and buyers were not enthusiastic. The only ones that could be mentioned were Nos. 2, 5, and 11, etc., which had relatively more purchases, but at the same time, the selling volume from the sellers was even stronger. No. 46 also had twenty-two-year customs tariffs sold. Although the market price at the opening and closing differed by three points, the difference between the front and back was as much as seven jiao, with the market price opening at 61 yuan, then immediately dropping to 0.05 jiao, and finally closing at 0.03 jiao. It can be seen that the number of actual goods sold must have been large. Then, No. 48 sold, and although there were buyers in the market, it ultimately appeared weak and unable to rise. Therefore, in the two morning sessions and the afternoon opening session, each session generally had a pullback of two or three jiao. The twenty-two-year tariff, because it had not seen the previous price made before opening for many days, fell sharply by one yuan, failing to stabilize. Among them, although No. 16 bought forward disarmament, it once raised the price by two jiao. The nineteen-year customs duty still showed no improvement. Later, because the market slightly covered short positions, starting from the forward twenty-year customs duty, it slightly recovered by one or two jiao. However, No. 6 still remained small by about one jiao due to oversupply. In summary, there is currently no improvement, and the market price results mostly continued to fall by one or two jiao to about half a yuan. Only the twenty-two-year customs tariff fell by one yuan three jiao to two yuan. The total transaction volume was 7,863,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods and 7,860,000 yuan in futures. The results of the increase or decrease are compared and listed as follows (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e235">New York Stock Market Extremely Chaotic <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung &amp; Co. on the 5th stated that the New York stock market still lacks change. First, because Roosevelt's speech hinted that he favored increasing wages and reducing working hours, Wall Street believed that this would reduce corporate profits, so the market was sluggish all day. Later, there were rumors that the government would soon raise the price of gold to save prices from falling sharply. Holmes Stock Gold Mine shares soared by 20 yuan. According to reports, the silver faction plans to force the government to mint silver coins, and silver mine shares rose quite strongly. Market sentiment then turned firm. The small exchange lacked buyers, and the market was slightly weak. Bonds were strong due to the strength of foreign public bonds. The total transaction volume for the day was only 950,000 shares. (Wheat) Lacked buyers, and speculators sold slightly loosely. It can be seen that the supply has been drastically reduced, and the Northwest will soon be severely cold. (Cotton) The activities of raising gold prices and the silver faction have a stabilizing effect, but factory purchases are not enthusiastic, speculation is sluggish, and old bulls are tired of selling. Fertilizer sales have increased sharply. At high prices, more selling has increased in the South, and the market seems to be very high temporarily. In addition, this firm received a report from New York Standard Statistics Company that stock prices are down eight yuan from their February peak. There will be no significant changes in the recent period, but the profits of various companies will inevitably show significant progress in the spring. Therefore, the fierce rise of industrial stocks and railway stocks at that time can be predicted. At this time of divergence, what should be paid attention to is selling bad securities and purchasing more promising ones, or holding large sums of money and waiting for opportunities. Interest rates will remain low, so high-grade bonds and government bonds are still good. Although the market occasionally pulls back and the political and monetary atmosphere is often chaotic, the general progress of industry and commerce has shown a glimmer of dawn, so the stock market in the spring can indeed be optimistic. Recent developments in Washington, such as re-estimation, are also sufficient to support the correctness of this statement. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>| Standard Yarn Market Rebounds |</p>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but actual demand was still sluggish, so people's hearts were extremely tired. There were still many people selling when prices rose. However, the situation of American cotton was still strong. There were many rumors in the market that the Japanese factory's 20-count Honhui yarn was sold for only 170 yuan including tax. Therefore, short positions were more concentrated. According to a partial survey, the Tianjin gang purchased 3,000 pieces of Japanese yarn yesterday, but the price was not detailed.</p>

<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with American cotton flat and Indian cotton falling, and the atmosphere softened. Prices for each month rose or fell by one, two, or three jiao. In the afternoon, it was said that a certain manufacturer purchased, and the market suddenly rose, and the situation was tighter. Prices for each month rose by three, four, five jiao to nine jiao and one yuan two jiao. The total transaction statistics for the day were 24,100 bales. It was found that Yuan Da sold 600 bales, Sui Long 1,600 bales, Tong Fu 650 bales, Chang Feng 1,350 bales, and Xie Sheng 650 bales.

<p>The cotton market is calm, but the situation is still soft. Due to the slow transactions of yarn and cloth, although American cotton is stable, Indian cotton is trending down, which has caused people to lose heart. There is a lack of buyers, spot cotton sales have stopped, and various factories are particularly slow to import. It is reported that British yarn factories have said that 115 factories have stopped working due to declining sales. The selling atmosphere is relatively strong. From the overall trend of the cotton market, there may not be a major fall.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Standard Cotton Weak <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning with American cotton flat and Indian cotton falling, and the atmosphere was not good. Prices for each month fell by five fen to one jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Later, it rose due to purchases by peers and covering of short positions. As a result, spot goods rose by 5 pounds per ton, and futures rose by 1 pound per ton to 4 pounds per ton. Distant months, on the other hand, fell by 1 pound per ton. Liverpool cotton spot goods fell by 11 points, and futures fell by 89 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 13 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to sales by Japanese and European exporters and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Pinggar fell by 2 rupees 7.5 jiao, Aomura fell by 3 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 5th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month generally showed a hovering trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat from Chicago was about one jiao lower, and the quoted price from Canada was four fen lower. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere for each month was generally flat, and buying and selling were also sluggish. Therefore, the market price was similar to the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, the opening price for each month suddenly turned positive. It was rumored that some large factories were stopping production due to flour inventory. At the same time, it was also rumored that the quoted price of Argentine wheat had risen, recently opening at 4 yuan 2.5 jiao. Therefore, this month gradually increased. Distant months also rose slightly because the factory code was not released. If customer sales are good later, there is still a trend of further improvement in the near term. As a result, this month was up 1.5 fen from the previous day, April was up 1.5 fen, May was up 1.25 fen, June was up 1.5 fen, and July and August were up 1 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the future wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally showed a stable trend. However, transactions for each month were still very sluggish. Only a few cars were opened this month in the afternoon. Although the price has not been opened for several days due to factory support, it has improved by nearly a jiao compared to the beginning of the week. Transactions for distant months were also sluggish, and there was no change in price. It was found that the situation in the wheat market, in the old goods stalls, the in and out may not be very large. It must be when there is certainty about the new wheat that it can be lively. Spot wheat transactions were also sluggish. Only 200 bags of Shandong wheat were opened, with a price of 3 yuan 5 jiao.</p>

<p>11,000 Bags Opened Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of Hakka Xian rice was that some goods from the road arrived in Shanghai, and the owners sought to sell them. The market was mostly medium and secondary grades, and the selling intention was particularly active. After the opening of the market in the morning, all grades below the middle grade fell by five or six fen, and high-grade goods also leveled off slightly. Then, the local street slightly inquired, and Quanzhou and Fuzhou purchased at the reduced market price. However, the current market price in Fujian Province has not risen, and there are also direct shipments from various routes. Therefore, although the appetite is active, the purchase price is very tight. The city opened a total of 11,030 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi rice, of which 900 bags of brown rice went from Ningbo to Hankou, 850 bags of Hunan machine millet from the local street to Jing, more than 500 bags of brown red rice, and more than 400 bags of Jiangxi machine late and machine yuan rice. The rest were all purchased by Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian Province. Fuzhou had a better appetite, with an estimated 5,000 bags going there, and Quanzhou had 2,300 to 2,400 bags going there. The market was weak but revived, still similar to the previous market. Market conditions: High-grade goods have not changed, and medium-grade goods have been balanced by three or four fen.</p>

<p>Medium-thick serge is a fast-selling product for Western clothing gangs. Therefore, even though the Hanling stick is popular, the sales of medium-thick serge are still extensive and the English high-grade serge does not fade. English and Americans on warships also often specify it. Most of the ordinary clothing consumers use blue and white edges and Tianyou No. 1000, No. 2000, and Dongfang No. 3008 and other brands. Recently, except for the dismantling shops in Hongkou that have high-grade thick serge, the ordinary goods in the Qipan Street area are very scarce. This is because the arrivals and stocks are not abundant, and the market sales are active, so the supply does not meet the demand. Therefore, yesterday the market atmosphere turned firm. Brands such as Tianyou No. 1000 and No. 2000 were all sold at 5 yuan 2.5 jiao, Dongfang No. 3008 was 5 yuan 1 jiao, Ningfeng Ruyitu was 4 yuan 7.5 jiao, and Deji Foreign Beauty was 5 yuan 2.5 jiao.</p>

<p>White tiles have already been delivered from the road and are also thriving. It is said that more than 200 dan were opened yesterday. Therefore, in this sluggish hardware market, there is quite a sense of standing out among mediocrities. Market conditions: No. 22 and No. 24 are estimated at 12 yuan 4 jiao per metric ton, No. 26 is estimated at 13 yuan 2 jiao, and No. 28 is estimated at 13 yuan 8 jiao. It is said that the spot goods of No. 26 and No. 28 are even scarcer, so the market is surprisingly sought after, and buyers are even more delighted.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Green Lead Market Conditions Declining Daily <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Green lead was estimated at 15 yuan yesterday (level balance), down three jiao from the previous day. Transactions were very few, causing the market to be sluggish. Market conditions still have a downward trend. It is said that in recent days, transactions have been limited to decorations such as furnace workshops and printing houses, and there is still nothing worth mentioning in major transactions.</p>

<p>— Qi Su</p>
<p>A huge barrel stands on the current system, so sturdy that it's impossible to find even a tiny leak. People with round bellies take out two large bowls of water from the barrel every day; but at the same time, they pour in five bowls, so the barrel gradually fills up. Much water cannot stand firm inside the barrel, is squeezed out, shouting and climbing around the barrel. This phenomenon, some call it "overproduction," and those squeezed out are the "unemployed."</p>
<p>There are more and more of these people. Society is filled with these dregs, like fallen leaves in autumn, making it impossible to arrange a place for them! And there are many people who were born too late; when they hurriedly crawl out of their "mother's womb," society is already jammed. So they have no chance to enjoy human life, grow up in a harsh environment, without education, without kindness, and without any so-called personality. They don't know what is called thought, called nobility, called harmfulness, only know how to live for immediate pleasure. Anyway, effort is the same, messing around is the same, messing around is the same.</p>
<p>There are a frightening number of these people in Shanghai! Every street, every alley, has their footprints, all places where they seek temporary indulgence. "Stalking," "fighting," "extortion" are their lives. "Chu na" is an indispensable word in their vocabulary. "The body isn't rented, fighting doesn't need learning" is their view of life. "As long as you're ruthless, you can take advantage" is their philosophy. They are always muddle-headed, like flies in June, flying everywhere.</p>
<p>This disease is gradually affecting schools. Bold students glare at them! Cowardly students avoid them, and some are opportunistic? For the sake of convenience in all aspects, the opportunistic ones join forces with them. After all, there are many opportunistic ones! Students are also hanging around with them. Students have become ruffians. Isn't this the most terrifying and widespread phenomenon in recent years?</p>
<p>So the gentlemen sighed. The scholars became agitated. On the imposing lecture platform, in the exquisite reception rooms, at the luxurious banquets, they raise their arms and shout, "This is too bad! This is too bad!" If this continues, how can the country not be weak? How can the great powers not steadily advance and occupy it? They think this is all because the people of the country don't pay enough attention to spiritual training and moral cultivation. Oh! Promote national salvation through spirituality! Oh! Sacred spirit! Hardship, endurance, kindness, universal love, patience, progress, upwardness, bravery, simplicity, integrity, incorruptibility…</p>
<p>But gentlemen and scholars who are used to comfort, don't be fooled by some nice-sounding names! If spirituality could really save the country, our ancient country, which has cultivated spirituality for thousands of years, would never have come to this point. What is spirit? Bombs, airplanes, cannons, that is the true spirit of today's society with its mask removed! "If someone slaps your left cheek, then offer them your right cheek." Can that really move people? That was a long, long time ago. If it had bones, the bones would have turned into minerals long ago, and the minerals would have been used up long ago.</p>
<p>Noble gentlemen! You have sharp fingernails, but you should also have keen eyes! See the bottom of things, dig out the roots, listen to the background of things, find out the truth.</p>
<p>Those people with protruding bellies are taking out two bowls and pouring in five bowls!</p>
<h3 id="e272">The Art of Sleeping (Part 1) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>Regarding sleeping, I remember a scientist who used inductive reasoning to prove the importance of sleeping.</p>
<p>His proof is that everyone has to sleep every night.</p>
<p>This scientist also said, "Sleeping time accounts for at least one-third of people's lifespan." In addition, he further enlightened us: when sleeping, we should pay attention to the time, temperature, and posture, and be careful not to hinder health and benefit the body.</p>
<p>At that time, after listening to this scientist's words, I felt like I had learned more than reading books for ten years. I admired him so much that I wanted to submit a student application to worship him as a teacher, to put in some effort in the science of sleeping, in order to seek deeper knowledge. But I am a lazy fool by nature, and I am most afraid of being managed, and science is the best at managing people. If I worshipped him as a teacher and didn't study diligently and transformed into something that was neither a donkey nor a horse, a "neither-nor," wouldn't that embarrass my teacher?</p>
<p>"Each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't worry about the frost on other people's roofs." As long as you think it suits your taste, it's better to do things your own way. So when I sleep, I still sleep one or two hours more than ordinary people. I still cover myself with one and a half more quilts than ordinary people. I still sleep with my head covered, lying on my left side or flat on my back - everything is still the same as before. As for the scientist's words, they went in through the right ear and came out through the left ear. From then on, I never thought about the science of sleeping again. And so, another two years have passed.</p>
<p>In total, sleeping like this, sleeping, until now, I have slept for twenty-four three hundred and sixty-five nights. In these twenty-four three hundred and sixty-five nights, I have understood some of the beauty and comfort of sleeping. I feel that sleeping should also be considered an art. As for art, I seem to have heard such a saying: "Even if a person's every move, anything that they think is extraordinary and can enrich their life, from a certain point of view, it can be said to be an art."... Here, a physiologist suddenly angrily said, "You don't understand art at all, but you want to talk about art, you're defiling art; according to you, then shitting, pissing, and farting all have to be called art? Ridiculous! Ridiculous!" This gentleman is really nosy. I'm writing my own things, why does he have to nag: "Tell me the reasons why sleeping is art!" I should reply: "How dare I? How dare I? Please calm down, and allow me to explain it in detail:"</p>
<p>"In the large and small Western-style houses on Jing'an Temple Road, Foch Road, or Gordon Road, Seymour Road, Yuyuan Road, etc., the faint electric light shines through the snow-white纱 curtains from the windows, reflecting the murky winter sky, the piano in the room resonates with both solemn and melodious (one) (two) (three) (four) (five) sounds, and the lullabies from the radio, vaguely, wave after wave, reach the ears of pedestrians on the road. If you are a thoughtful person, you might as well walk slowly along these roads, take out a cigarette, strike a match, and slowly smoke and think. Think about what the owners of those Western houses are doing, and experience their taste, it will really make you want to think more and more, so much so that you don't even realize that the cigarette in your mouth is burning your lips, that's enough to make your soul truly inverted! Look, do you see? Doesn't it seem like a magnificent and exquisite bedroom is appearing before your eyes? Look, aren't the silver frames hanging on the walls decorated with light yellow plaster all paintings of foreign women? Isn't the floor covered with thick and soft carpets? Isn't it plum blossoms in full bloom on the flower stand? Aren't all the furnishings in the room comfortable and beautiful? Also, in the center of the room! What is standing there, burning red, if not an electric heater? The radio that is playing in front of the bedside table! Do you see? Isn't a middle-aged man with a face full of smiles sitting in the bed, his legs already stretched into the quilt, his upper body wearing a wool pajama leaning against the headboard? One hand is holding a book and reading, and the other hand is holding a cigar between two fingers. The radio is still playing, playing. The man listens intently, sometimes closing his eyes like this, sometimes picking up his cigar and taking a puff. Suddenly, the head of the bed moved a little, and a head poked out from the quilt - a woman's head! I didn't see it at first, there was still a beautiful woman sleeping in the bed under the quilt. How soul-stirring! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Lili is a lovely child. Her younger brother is missing.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Female Writer Ya Fei <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In modern society, almost everything has become commodified! Art and literature are of course things to earn a living, and in the end, they cannot escape commodified competition. Nowadays, even personality is being auctioned off!</p>
<p>Recently, a female writer: in order to "understand society," went to "try a new life" (as she herself said), so she did not hesitate to run into an XXX dance hall to work as a dancer. I imagine this female writer; is at least great, brave. Since she herself declared: "This is because she felt that life had no meaning, and went to try this new life"... then there is no doubt, she did not come here for economic reasons, for life. But I think; being a dancer is still a profession, not a noble profession, a profession of being hugged and embraced by others; using beauty, using smiles, using... to earn money. Those dancers who are oppressed by the environment and driven by life; we should already sympathize with them, pity them. Because they are struggling under the claws of demons! Perhaps hot tears will drip from their welcoming smiles. Otherwise, who would really be willing to do this kind of night life that sells the soul, sells the body, and is played with by others? This is for money, money calls them to do it, and they think so, this is a degenerate business, this is an inhuman life. They want to be a young mistress, grandmother, or even a wife, ride in a car, live in a Western-style house, how happy. But fate controls their reality.</p>
<p>Now this female writer; actually boldly goes to try the life of a dancer, which is equivalent to selling the body, her only ambition is "to understand society." It is true that the deformed complexity of modern society cannot be denied by anyone, but if you want to understand society, you must deeply understand the situation and organization of modern society, and make a detailed observation. Like an explorer, run into the steep and dangerous deep mountains and jungles to experience it firsthand. Then, I naturally also hope, like the departure of an explorer, that this female writer will return with great gains. But, pitifully, what she tried was only the life of a dancer. If she were willing to go a step further and try to approach more of the upper, middle, and lower societies, I believe that her understanding of society would be truly thorough.</p>
<p>However, I always feel somewhat suspicious about her? If she simply said, for life, for the economy, then we should of course not criticize her, but also sympathize with her. Because being a dancer is still a profession, and professions are inherently non-noble, without class. Now she insists on saying that it is "trying a new life," and for "wanting to understand society." But, I think that this is inevitably somewhat opportunistic! If she really wants to "understand society," then I want to advise her to do... here, it is easier to approach society than being a dancer, and it is easier to experience all the dark and bright sides of society, people, and life.</p>
<p>How resounding is the name of a writer. Having the title of a writer is like ascending the Dragon Gate, and your worth increases tenfold. However, sometimes there are people who go to sell writers, sell the personality of writers!</p>

<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Rong wrote from Beiping, and the first sentence said that Xiong committed suicide in Beihai last month. The reason is written on the stationery like this:</p>
<p>We not only grieve for Xiong, but we should also be indignant for him! Although he has not made any contributions to society, he has already vowed to dedicate himself; but society is cruelly ruthless to him! This was still during the summer vacation last year, when he graduated from university. He didn't think that wearing a square hat would increase his worth. He was just secretly happy that he had reached a stage in his studies, and could serve society from now on. At that time, he was really burning with the flame of life, enthusiastically advancing on the journey of life. But, in this society, he didn't know that he was a poor boy without wealthy relatives, where was his place? Where was there something for him to do? So he ran from Beiping to Tianjin, from Tianjin to Shanghai. He lived in Shanghai for two months. Later, he told me that he had forgotten where you lived, so he never had a chance to see you. I think this was his fatal injury, because if he could find you, you could help him a little, and wouldn't let him run around on the wide, smooth roads for two months in vain. In his suicide note, it is said that he was not discouraged at that time, and he was still ambitiously going to create a gold mountain of career in his ideal. The seed of his suicide this time was planted when he left Shanghai for Guangzhou, and failing to get anything, from Guangzhou to Nanchang; in Nanchang, he still achieved nothing, so he began to curse life. He listened without any control to the encouragement of an unrelated fellow villager. Finally, he drifted to his hometown, hometown, a hometown that was bankrupt and collapsed, how could it be the location of his gold mountain of career? Of course, this was nothing more than reducing his courage to be a human being. At the beginning of the month, he suddenly ran here to see me, saying that his affairs were all resolved. At that time, I thought that he had really found a job, and I was enthusiastically congratulating him. How could I know that he was solving his problems by dying? In his suicide note, he said, "Anyway, Beiping is the place that made me a vagrant, so I might as well die in Beiping." He also explained, "If I had given up struggling these last four years, I believe society wouldn't have abandoned me like this." How sad and painful this must be!...</p>
<p>I trembled, holding the letter high and silently reading it, and the face of a lively and happy young man appeared in my mind. His strong and tall figure, sincere and enthusiastic temperament, especially the pair of dark, sharp eyes deeply sunken under his thick eyebrows, revealed great wisdom. Usually, he was always worried that the education of the ancient Chinese nation was not enough, and he vowed to put the great task of revitalization on his own shoulders, so although he was poor, he wanted to go to school to study. Every semester, he desperately borrowed from friends, for four years, he struggled so hard, but he was always happy and optimistic, because in his ideal, there really existed a "gold mountain of career," and he was also very confident in this.</p>
<p>Xiong is dead, of course I want to grieve for him, and like Rong, express indignation at this society! However, Xiong's own words in his suicide note are ultimately reasonable, "If I had given up struggling these last four years..." How profound and painful this must be!</p>
<p>Here, we have an understanding of the existing traditional education: schools are like a birdcage, a delicate and beautiful birdcage, although the bird's owner has arranged rockeries and artificial rocks inside, and there are also precious and delicious foods, but the bird students are ultimately separated from the real mountains and real rocks in nature. Their line of thought is ultimately circling the rockeries and artificial rocks in this delicate and beautiful cage. Once they leave the cage and return to nature, they undoubtedly feel lost, and even lose the instinct to fly! We know how cruel and sinful this birdcage is! However, destroying this birdcage must be done by the birds themselves.</p>

<p>— Written by Italian M Serao, Translated by Jing Xin</p>
<p>She opened the door, letting her mother and sister walk out, bowing deeply, and whispering; "Madam, Miss!" When they walked out of the house, she laughed loudly at them at the door and shouted:</p>
<p>"You just go ahead and talk, I'll pretend I don't know anything."</p>
<p>Normally, Robert. Montfort Lanco. He is not a very thoughtful person; he is not enough to become a thinker. His life is banquets, riding horses, and visitors; his nights are spent happily with his fiancée Lulu. Then there are the troublesome matters that need to be handled, appointments with his lawyer, the signing of certain contracts, the resolution of some existing claims, and many other annoying things, such as his family and his honeymoon. He hardly has half an hour to read, no fifteen minutes to stop at a coffee shop, so we never see him immersed in deep thought, and we never see him engaged in solving any social problems, because there is no such heroic or tragic temperament in Robert's character. His temperament can rather be said to be calm, and many people are therefore jealous of him.</p>
<p>But on this day in the afternoon, he leaned back in his armchair, one leg crossed over the other, concentrating on reading. The book was quite interesting; but it was a bit novel, which made the reader absent-minded. In fact, he was not just absent-minded; he was restless and a little nervous. He hadn't turned a page, because just after reading two lines, the words printed on the page seemed to be jumping, unreadable, and disappearing. Robert naturally entered a realm of thought he had never experienced before.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Regarding the Production of Aviation Films (Continued) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zhen</p>
<p>In aviation film combat scenes, most are filmed using two or more aircraft. The aircraft carrying the actors is equipped with machine guns, and after the actors are seated inside and fly up, they begin acting, as if the bullets fired from their machine guns are hitting enemy aircraft. At this time, there are aircraft following him on his left and right sides. Inside these left and right aircraft sit the director and cameraman, who are there filming the actor's performance. When both sides have captured the actor's performance, it is as if the scenes were not performed at the same time, because the positioning of the cameras is different, so the scenes they film are also different. Then, by selectively using scenes from these different positions, many scenes can be created. This is a convenient method, but the machine gun firing scenes must never be filmed head-on towards the camera, because if the machine gun muzzle is aimed at the camera and fired, not only will the scene not be filmed, but the cameraman's life will be lost.</p>
<p>We can also see the aircraft seemingly flying straight towards us, about to reach us and then suddenly flying upwards and away. This is also a very difficult scene to film. To film this scene, a camera is mounted on one aircraft to film another aircraft. The aircraft being filmed flies straight towards the aircraft with the camera. Just as they are about to collide, the filmed aircraft flies past the aircraft with the camera. When shown in the film, it looks like the aircraft is flying straight towards us, about to reach us, and then suddenly flying upwards.</p>
<p>When actors are filming aviation scenes, if they feel slightly unwell, they should not be forced to fly into the sky. Forcing themselves to act on the ground is still possible, but not in the sky. A sick actor flying into the sky can make their illness worse. Therefore, before filming an aviation film, every staff member and actor must be very healthy to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Some thrilling scenes in aviation films are made using rephotography. In our eyes, it looks like a very thrilling event has occurred in the sky, but during filming, it is not necessarily very dangerous. Some scenes are filmed outdoors first, and then brought back to the company's glass studio for re-filming, using reprinting methods to ensure that no flaws are revealed. When you watch it, you still think it was filmed safely in the sky. Some are also filmed using models. This is the same as using models in ordinary films. If the cameraman's movements and camera panning are appropriate, you will definitely not be able to tell that it is a model. Lighting is very important when filming aviation films. Although it is entirely using sunlight, the cameraman must use the light well to increase the power of the drama.</p>
<p>The editing of aviation films is also very important. If an aviation film is edited well, it can provide many tense scenes that give you a powerful stimulation. Otherwise, the thrilling scenes filmed with a lot of effort, money, and great difficulty and danger will not feel thrilling at all when you watch them. Therefore, aviation films must not only pay attention to cinematography, but also to the editing work.</p>
<p>The production of aviation films is not an easy task, it is much more difficult than filming ordinary films. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e279">Review of "I Lived With You" <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I Lived With You</p>
<p>丨Lanxin Guanglu丨</p>
<p>I think this kind of story is not entirely without meaning. When the wandering Grand Duke sold two diamonds from a watch bestowed upon him by Emperor Nicholas, it caused conflict and unease in the family. The father stole half of the proceeds, while the mother regarded him as an honored guest and boasted about him to the neighbors. The elder sister fell in love with him, and the younger sister also wanted to take him for herself, all because he had once been a glorious Grand Duke and possessed the valuable diamonds on the watch.</p>
<p>Here, it can be proven that the playwright, Luo Faluo, truly has experience in human affairs. He not only uses jewels to increase the conflict in a seemingly happy family, but he even makes them lose their reason. These are very realistic phenomena, regardless of whether only an exiled Grand Duke can achieve this. Of course, the playwright later develops his own ideals; he does not allow the Grand Duke to further destroy the family's happiness, but teaches him to resolutely leave the family. However, in order to make people sympathize with the Grand Duke's kindness, he ultimately allows the passionate Gedaisi to follow him, saying that she is following him out of love to live a simple life.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, we can see the playwright's entire ideology. Perhaps Luo Faluo wrote the play entirely for his own starring role, so in many scenes, he tries his best to express himself. In particular, the ups and downs of the love between the protagonist and Gedaisi are written vividly. Therefore, he takes such material, conceiving an exiled Grand Duke in his ideal. In the unique personality of being romantic, suave, and self-sacrificing, he allows himself to be able to exert himself to the utmost when starring.</p>
<p>But any material, when we adopt it, must be chosen through our own thinking. Then Luo Faluo uses the characters of the old Russian royal family as his own stand-ins, and also vigorously sympathizes with him; this is by no means accidental, but fully reflects his own ideology. Perhaps some people will say that he does not have any obvious insults to the current Russian government in the play, and even in the dialogue, he does not curse the revolution in any way. However, rather than saying that he is standing in the position of a third party and not involving himself in politics, it is better to say that he cannot and dare not do so. Moreover, he wants the audience to sympathize with the fate of the royal family, even if it is sentimental, this has already given people a bad impression.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Luo Faluo wrote the play entirely for himself, so his performance is indeed worthy of praise. It goes without saying that he can act calmly, and his delicate performance is even more commendable. In his performance, we can see that he has full cultivation, and even the slightest movement reveals a wealth of emotion.</p>
<p>However, it is no exaggeration to say that the only commendable aspect of this film is his performance. In addition, the actress who plays the mother also performs extremely well. When she boasts to her neighbors in the vegetable market, and when she immediately bursts into loud weeping when she suffers a temporary setback, we can see a deep understanding of the character in the play. Furthermore, the actress who plays Gedaisi is also very good. The actress who plays Mrs. Felix's cousin gives us a serious impression.</p>
<p>Naturally, if we consider this work not to be a failure, then the director deserves considerable credit. Regarding this aspect of the review, other than the introduction of the identities and professions of those individuals at the beginning being not economical enough, all other scenes are very refined. Naturally, the gag on the female cook proves that British films will tend to be first-class with American films, but this is also the best way to reconcile the dullness; for example, the two sitting together several times is a long conversation, which is necessary to regulate. However, like the Grand Duke not bathing and making the sound of bathing, this can both depict the Grand Duke's laziness and is a very interesting scene.</p>
<p>Other than that, there is nothing else to say. This is a rare comedy with a touch of tragedy among a series of British comedies, although it does not have any particular value.</p>
<h3 id="e280">"Gold Diggers of the Sky" to be Released Soon <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>While every film company is vying to produce musical films, RKO naturally is not willing to lag behind and is also working hard on this type of product. "Gold Diggers of the Sky" is its first and last musical film. In terms of style and conception, it does have distinct differences. First, it moves the grand musical scenes to the great sky, and transforms the footing of hundreds of beautiful girls to the wings of airplanes. While the airplanes soar in the sky, the beauties dance on the wings. Second, the ground musical troupe emphasizes artistry. There is a very exquisite tango dance, and teams of dancing dolls advance and retreat at a measured pace with the music. In particular, a poetic love song "Carioca." The singing will make anyone's heart sway and be unable to control themselves. The protagonists of the film are Dolores del Río and Gene Raymond. The director is Thornton Freeland. His past work "Flying Down to Rio" once swept across the entire Shanghai. The film has already been booked by the Grand Shanghai Theatre and will be released in the shortest possible time.

<p>The villain Zhang Zhentuo purchased a fourth-term aviation lottery ticket with the number "324509." It happened to differ from the first prize "324504" by only the last digit. On the day of the draw, Zhang saw the first prize number in the evening newspaper, which truly infuriated him. He didn't even eat dinner and talked incoherently into the night, shouting that he wanted to jump into the Huangpu River. His wife has been carefully watching over him day and night for the past two days, fearing that he might actually throw himself into the Huangpu River!</p>

<p>Child star Shao Suxia recently bought a small camera. It is exquisite, small, and has a beautiful design. However, because she is a beginner in photography, the results are very poor. Yesterday, she took half a dozen photos with Guan Dafangzi in the sunlight. Guan Fatty was very happy and prepared to send a copy to his beloved wife after they were developed. However, after the photos were developed, they either lacked a nose and ears, or had a mouth but no eyes, or were even invisible. None of the six photos looked like a person, which infuriated Guan Fatty so much that the fat on his face kept trembling. He exclaimed that he had bad luck this year.</p>

<p>The old man Wei Pengfei, although nearly fifty years old, is as physically strong as a robust young man. Wei recently became acquainted with a Guangdong woman who is thirty-eight years old, beautiful, and skilled in poetry and prose. Therefore, Wei is very fond of her. Every day, as soon as he finishes work at the company, he goes straight home. As a result, he no longer has the heart to feed the several beloved white rabbits he keeps at the company. The day before yesterday, Wei suddenly remembered that he had not fed the rabbits for many days. He rushed to the rabbit hutch and found it empty. Only bloodstains and several piles of leftover bones could be seen on the ground. It was clear that the rabbits had been eaten by weasels. Wei couldn't help but shed tears at this tragic sight. At this time, Ge Erkuaitou (Note: Ge Erkuaitou is Ge Furong. Ge was originally Tianyi's number one fatty, but since Guan Hongda joined Tianyi, Ge could no longer monopolize the title of fatty, so he had to settle for second place) was standing next to him and said silently: "Old Wei, don't be a weasel mourning for the rabbit, go home and see your wife."

<p>Everyone probably still remembers that hot girl Clara Bow has a white mouse, the one she went to New York and forgot to bring, and then specially sent a plane to pick up. Now that mouse is dead, and Clara even shed a lot of tears for it, because she had been feeding it for five years, and they can be said to be dependent on each other. When the mouse died, many of her friends, knowing her grief, found many small animals, such as badger cubs, guinea pigs, and parrots, and sent them to her, but she could not change her mood and mourn, and she said to everyone she met: "Pinky" (small mouse nickname) is dead, nothing in the world can replace it!</p>

<h3 id="e286">The Scarlet Empress Catherine the Great <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Sumei</p>
<p>A Paramount Production Directed by Josef von Sternberg Starring Marlene Dietrich</p>
<p>Almost two hundred years ago, in a corner of Prussia, there was a young and beautiful woman, a princess, spending her leisurely years, unaware that her future destiny would be to become the Empress of Russia. This petite and delicate woman was Princess Sophia Frederica, still a naive young girl. She had a small oval face, eyes as blue as the sky, and hair curls that shone like gold. Her petite body was full of exuberant youthful vitality. The world she knew was only the realm of love. She loved her nanny, Kadul, and also her teacher, Wagner. She also loved her young and beautiful mother, Princess Johanna, but she did not know her mother's ambitions and ruthless plans for her. She especially respected her father. Her father, Prince August, was older than her mother and was a very loving, wise, and experienced man. She also loved one thing, which was her old doll. Although she was past the age of playing with dolls, she still often slept with it, telling it her happy dreams in bed.</p>
<p>How different were Sophia's dreams from those of her mother! Princess Johanna often told her that she would become an Empress in the future. But what did Sophia secretly imagine? Just a ballerina! As for mentioning Russia, that strange country far away in the far north, Sophia only knew some of it from what Wagner painstakingly taught her from books 丨丨What Peter the Great, what Ivan the Terrible, all were cruel and overbearing tsars 丨丨There were also Cossack soldiers as fierce as beasts and oppressed and groaning commoners. In Sophia's innocent and tender mind, none of these were real, just some stories in books that would be forgotten after reading. How could real people be like this?</p>
<p>But in Johanna's heart, the throne of Russia was real. She was moving her pieces, thinking deeply and carefully. One day, the Russian envoy arrived. Sophia's father called her to introduce the Russian Emperor's ambassador, Duke Alexei. Alexei had come to welcome her and her mother to Moscow. Her visit to Russia was to marry the Russian Grand Duke, Peter Fyodorovich. Peter Fyodorovich was the grandson of Peter the Great and the nephew of the Russian Empress Elizabeth, and he was going to inherit the throne in the future. Duke Alexei was young, and he was a little stunned when he saw how beautiful Sophia was. He slowly said, "Your Highness, Princess, although people in our country have long heard of your beauty, but really. I wasn't prepared to see such elegance." After he finished speaking, he bowed and kissed Sophia's slender jade hand. (To be continued)</p>
