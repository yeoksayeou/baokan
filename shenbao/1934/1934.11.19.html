<h3>論日本之臨時議會與財政</h3>
<p>— 舒。</p>
<p>在倫敦海軍軍縮會議預備會談中。美國顯欲維持舊日比率。或令華盛頓倫敦兩條約延長。英國則擬另結新約。在原則上廢除該兩條約。此雖與日本之意見相近。而實際內容。並不相容。技術見解相差亦甚遠也。此種形勢。於日本軍備平等之主張殊多障礙。固可不煩言而喻。顧日本既高唱軍備平等論調。宜有充分之財力。而按諸實際。則茍延殘喘之農民。固無馀力以贊助軍備之擴張。而工業重心之大阪一帶。亦因風水災害。損失特重。自力復興且感困難。又安能填軍閥無窮之慾壑。日本農村與城市之現狀如此。故有召開臨時議會共籌良策良策之要求。</p>
<p>日本政府對於正黨向多顧忌。而有難以應付之感。蓋政府欲隨時操縱多數議員。既不可能。而解散議會逕行其是。亦常為事實所不許是以現政府蹉跎復蹉跎。延至今日。始決定於十一月底召集臨時議會就現勢論凡主張憲政常道承認議會政治為最高政治原則者。應歡欣鼓舞。準備充分實力。以應付此非常時期中所召集之議會。奈民政黨總裁若槻禮次郎竟於此議會召集聲中。突然宣言辭職。結果遂使民政黨之統率。成為難題。若槻既辭。後繼人選。頗費斟酌。黨內之政治主張不能集中。如何以整飭陣容。應付未來之政戰。如何以決定方案。救濟農工業之痛苦。皆不及充分研究。現雖總裁之人選問題暫告段落。以現任商工大臣町田忠治為總務會長。代行總裁職權。而黨內缺乏領袖人才。以及政黨政治之病態。皆已暴露無遺矣。民政黨如此。而擁有絕對多數議席與現政府處於敵對地位之政友會。亦竟無策動局之能力。充其量。饉　勉強維擊現狀。使黨務不致分裂而已。</p>
<p>總之。議會政治之在日本。早已　貌存質亡。］不克負荷真正之使命。或為民意之代表。惟憲法尚須維持。現制度亦難驟爾變更。故其形式尚得依舊存在也。</p>
<p>與現代議會制度有切關係之財政預算。在英國必受議會之監督。是為議會之最大權力。亦為其最重要之武器。然日本議會則不盡然。蓋議員不能不受傅統習慣之牽制。往往遷就特殊之軍要求。而鮮有異議。歷來日來議會對於政府預算案。祇能作技術上之指摘。而不了為根本之修正。職是之故。</p>
<p>現政府財政大臣藤井。並非政黨出身。故尚能不受政黨政治之束縛。而標榜其緊縮政策之主張。然藤井氏仍不能不將預算總支出百分之四十四劃為軍費。此外另加政費等支出。超過於收入者。仍在七萬萬日金以上。情勢如此。自未嘗完全克服一般所謂　赤字］之困難。不足之數。惟有發行公債。以資彌補。則藤井氏之緊縮政策。仍有名實不副之嫌。至於陸海軍雙方。雖得此龐大之軍費預算。仍不自滿足。其意固謂當此非常時期。國防需要絕不能以尋常眼光加以判斷。故軍費預算。必須如軍部之原案。不過因天災流行。救濟需費。乃肯略行讓步。自動減少若干耳。然無論如何。下一會計年度中之軍費支出。至少仍須增加兩萬萬日金。預計支出總數必將超過今年度之預算。又屬勢所必然者也。</p>
<p>以吾人之觀察。日本財政實處立於進退維谷之窘境。蓋如繼續發行巨額公債。財政界縱有擔負之馀力。而更足促成財富之集中。引起一般社會之不平。同時國債累增至百萬萬金以上。亦豈為長治久安之道。至於增加租稅。重增國民之負荷。固不待論。收入之數。最多不能過一萬萬日金。盃水車薪。亦屬無濟於事。財政問題之困難。殆為日正真本之困難，盲目要求軍備之平等。徒見其不自量力耳。</p>
<h3>美國傾向再開太平洋會議</h3>
<p>政治問題應得解決　　　維持原狀以保安全</p>
<p>華盛頓此間高級官員今日研究召集太平洋國家大會之可能性，蓋鑒於所有太平洋國家皆願根據領土原狀維持安全，此種會議或可大有成就、一般人以為此種會議或可更得合作及更得確切之結果、而不如歐洲類於此等會議之各自為政互相讓也、贊成舉行太平洋會議者表示、現在僅僅集中於討論海軍問題、足使其他範圍較廣之和平問題束置高閣、職是之故、太平洋國家舉行會議、或可在政治問題上成立協定、一如以前之華盛頓會議云、目下海軍部及國務院官員仍期待倫敦海軍談話之進展、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本覆電通知英外部</h3>
<p>海軍談判又入重要時期</p>
<p>倫敦松平山本兩代表及吉田大使等人、以日本政府之訓令為中心、自十七日午前至午後二時討議各項對策、以期第二步之對英折衝、得到萬全之方案、一方面則由松平大使派遣加藤參事官赴英國外交部通知、接到訓令情形、並希望提早會商、但因西門外相現未到部、未便決定會商日期、大約可於十九日午前商訂、由是觀之、豫備會商至此已入重要時期矣、（十七日日聯電）</p>
<p>東京目下在倫敦開會之軍縮初步談話、日政府期待根據日本提案、依照電訓松平全權之主旨、成立新協定、然現今日美間之主張完全對立、故日本進行主張不被容納時之一切準備、日本之方策如下一軍備實質均等之主張若能承認、則不拘形式、不防以決議文或宣言出之、萬一主張不被容納時、談話萬難繼續事實等於決裂、但日本始終不放棄軍縮希望、捨棄談話決裂之形式、倣照經濟會議之前例、主張無期延期、二該無期延期、由華府倫敦兩條約當事國之英美日法意等五國以共同宣言形式發表聲明、併不放棄軍縮希望、表明必要時繼續談話之意志、三一方由五國委員組織繼續委員會檢討新軍縮之方式、四五國以宣言形式聲明華府倫敦兩條約一九三六年滿期時止、嚴密遵守該兩約、不得競爭建艦、（十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>英與美將單獨訂約</h3>
<p>臺維斯請示羅斯福</p>
<p>倫敦華盛頓條約宣告廢止、倘屬無法避免、則列強究取何種態度乎、此已成為當前之一問題、日本政府之復文、已證明不願變更其談判開始時所採取之立塲、而美國態度、亦頗為堅定、不至有所讓步、因此海軍談判前途、已大可悲觀、據今晨泰晤土報所載華盛頓電訊、謂美國首席代表臺維斯、業向羅斯福總統提出英美雙方同意之條件、萬一英美日三國間不能成立協定、則英美當根據此種條件、成立兩國間之協定云、頃據官方人士宣稱、泰晤士報所載此項電訊、倘指臺難斯係由英國方面示意、提出英美同意之條件、則此說乃屬絕對不確、惟臺維斯未經與英國代表先行磋商、但就彼本人意見、與羅斯福總統接洽、則成屬可能、茍如此、則泰晤士報所載電訊、當事出有因、要之日本方面之強硬態度、已使海軍談判之形勢、頗陷於混沌、美國與美國分別訂立協定、造成英美對日聯合陣綫之形勢、此種辦法、在原則上能否為英國所接受、殊屬疑問、惟另一種辦法、卽由列強間分頭成立公開之雙方協定、使不能發生與日本對抗之印象、則不無加以考慮之可能、蓋英國無論如何、必力求避免與日本對立也、此種雙方分頭成立協定之辦法、能否獲得成功、雖未可預卜、然在目前、則頗為政界人士、仍保有一種印象、卽以為英國當保持其對日同情態度、使日本相信、英國不至設法以謀阻遏日本之海軍發展、蓋如此則舊時兩同盟國間之關係、勢必至於緊張也、由是更可見目前有兩種趨勢、一則同情於美國、一則同情於日本、一則謀英美之提攜、一則謀英日之提攜、而英國態度、則正依違於兩者之間、此兩種趨勢、或均未能獲得全勝、英國將根據日本之覆文、另圖折衷辦法、則亦未可知、一般人以為一俟英日再行會商、由日本代表陳述東京政府之復文後、英國尚將立卽與美國代表有所交涉云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦近日海軍談判、因日本態度強硬、陷於僵局、英美提攜之說、遂乃甚器塵上、星期泰晤士報頃載一文、謂［吾人可想像成立一種北大西洋協定、以維持海上之人道法典、以後再行陸續推行於各大洋、此種海洋協定若成、則未來和平與安全之希望、可擊於斯較之數字上之軍備縮減、效力更宏、不寗唯是、有此海洋協定、以增強和平力量、則吾人庶幾可獲得美國之合作、南菲前總理斯默資將軍、日前演說、中謂英國外交政策、當以英美合作為其基礎、斯默資此種主張、當可於此求其實現矣、要知此新合衆國之惟具有無窮之力量及政治思想與吾人接近而已］云云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓此間人士、對倫敦海軍談話、已認為極少成功之希望、蓋因美國已決定對於日本所要求之海軍平等權、決不讓步一寸也、如華盛頓條約、宣告廢止時、應採何種措置、業已加以考慮、對於美國首席代表臺維斯之建議、則一般人頗感興味、此項建議、主張由英美法意四國、先行訂立海軍條約、將來日本如放棄對於海軍對等權之要求、則可另行加入該約云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>薩爾瓦多排斥日貨</h3>
<p>東京據陶磁器輸出組合接到情報、薩爾瓦多為調整對日片面貿易之故、本所九月對日貨實施值百抽二十之課稅以來、日本對薩國輸出一時閉鎖、於是德國乘虛而入、減價二三成侵入該國、循此以往、日貨有根本被驅逐之虞、殊堪憂慮、且英貨之恢復南斐市塲、美貨之侵入古巴。哥倫比亞及南美等、及德貨之侵入上述各地等、其例均同、而日貨因此大受打擊、故外務省正在研究有望之新市塲、各國排斥廉價日貨之對策、為調整貿易均衡、及促進日貨輸出對此排斥日貨之舉、決與此等之國訂立新約努力、確保市塲、（十八日電通電）</p>

<p>羅馬今日首相墨索里尼宴請奧總理休樞尼格就餐、卽席發表演說、謂［全歐洲有團結協作之必要、奧意兩國邦交輯睦、卽完全為適應此需要之舉、同時吾人和平安定之志、亦藉是而獲得確實之保障、］首相續謂、意奧匈三國與他國之友誼、絕不以三國間之親善、［而妨礙其發展、］奧總理之答詞亦曰、［吾人與匈牙利邦交敦睦、絕不含有擯拒他國自處孤立之意義也］云云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬國聯會行政院所指派之薩爾問題三人委員會、在此間開會、已歷多日、原定今晚結束工作、惟德國派來專家、對於各項財政問題、雖允開始討論細目、但並未接得充分訓令、不得不重向柏林請示、新訓令須於星期一日、方可寄到、故三人委員會工作、亦為之延展云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎法國衆議員兼參戰軍人會主席高雅及巴黎市參議員摩尼耶曾晉見德國元首希特勒、會議兩小時之久、希氏對兩人所談之話、頃經晨報予以發表、略稱［德法兩國之間、不應發生誤會、目前之困難來自薩爾問題、謂德國欲作戰者實為一種狂妄之言、吾人經過前次大戰之後、深知戰爭之禍、實無益處、蓋兩國優秀份子同被摧殘、結果卽戰勝之國、亦不能得到任何利益、為今之計、宜恢復新社會秩序、如德法兩國能以調和、則惡夢自然消滅、心理上既得到安慰、而全歐經濟、亦自然改善矣、欲實現此種理想、全在兩國之努力、君等既為舊日參戰軍人、戰爭之禍、當已目擊、斷無不望世界之維持和平者］云云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>杭州訊、平陽礬礦儲量之富、甲於全球、國內除山西壽陽、山東之益都、河南之彰德、安徽之廬江等處外、亦首推平陽礬產額佔全國總量百分之七十以上、早已引起礦業學者之注意、如國防委員會、中央地質研究所、及浙江礦產調查所等、均先後派員赴平鑽探、以謀技術上之改良、至該礦本質含有硫酸鉀與硫酸鋁、聞建廰最近更發表一最簡的新方法、可將硫酸鉀硫酸鋁分而為二、前者可供肥料之用、後者可應工業之需、是和用明礬提煉鉀肥與精礬、以擴展礬銷、於礬業前途至關重大、茲將原報告探誌於後、</p>
<p>礦區概況　平陽礬礦區、原有兩處、一為北港區之苔湖山、早年經已停歇、一為南港區之赤垟山、（即俗稱礬山）位於縣南一百廿里叢山中、出口時由山行四十里、而逹藻溪、改裝江船至鰲江約五十馀里、轉趁海輪、較為便利、礦區面積約北山街南部起經水尾山、而東止於鷄籠山、長約十一里、礦石儲量、據中央研究所估計礬層厚自一八○公尺、礬石比重、中數為二七。五計可得礦石二千馀兆噸、（二。○四一。八七五。○○○噸）化騐結果、含礬質約百分之九十、土法提煉、每礦石四百斤、可提凈礬一百斤、即以八與一之比、計可提礬一百五十馀兆噸、</p>
<p>礦石種類　礦石種類甚多、成分不一、因而價亦不等、礦石分類為一生子二虎斑三大花四細花五大仁六白腦七烏溜等七種、然此純為礦工經騐上之評類、惟據中央研究所報告、明礬礦石之分子比較為k20.3　hl20.4　s03ch20、計之則第一種內含礬石百分之九二、馀為水分鋁、一養三、可視為水鋁石之非晶質、與赤鐵礦及石英相揉雜、第二種內含礬石約百之八○、馀為水分與砂養二及鋁二養三、或視為高嶺土、第三種為礬化流紋巖之一種、內含礬石約百分之四一、石英約百分之四八、馀為高嶺土、約百分之九、及赤鐵礦百分之一、第四種為礬石化之凝灰、巖土名火花、內含礬石百分之六○、石英約百分之二五、馀為高嶺土百分之三。五、赤鐵礦百分之四、</p>
<p>礬業現狀　現在營燒者計有十八窯、多由二人至五人組合而成、其經營分配方法、以每人每月認燒若干鑊為標準、每窯資本馀建築窯坑及設備約須四五千元外、尚須流動資本六千馀元、資本之來源除窯主自備一二千元外多由承賣商或錢荘借墊而來、故利息之負擔甚重、惟階級之分派自山主、採礦窯主煉礦分化甚多、了不相關、故不能成為有組織有系統之事業、</p>
<p>採煉方法　以前純係人工鑿掘、十四年後始改用爆炸藥開石法、製煉仍用土法、收集礦石分左右排列、窯內燒溶之、火透乃敢入水浸、搗碎入鍋、煎成濃液、傾入地坑礬桶中、任其結晶、</p>
<p>品類用途　一大明珠約佔產額百分之五、二撮珠佔百分之四十、三拳珠約佔百分之二十、四統珠佔百分之二十五、五粒子佔百分之十、考大明球為結晶最上層者、質最潔、故又名清礬、唯溶解甚難、故不如洋礬之暢銷、粒子則結晶於最下層、夾帶泥砂、故又名土礬、按目前情形、每窯每日可出礬四十包、年約三十四萬包、每包平均價格約二元五角、與成本相抵外約可獲利四角、至用途為一製染皮革、二製紙料用三醫藥用、四染色媒劑用、五替代酒石酸為麺包發酵用、六自來水廠瀘池用、七鍍金液、八肥料用、九製合金供軍用品用、至運銷地帶除國內之上海。溫州。臺州。寗波。及營口等處外、每年由香港轉運印度。菲律濱。安南。一帶、</p>
<p>失敗原因　一礦權之不確定、自山主採石窯主煉工以次各為分化、失統制調節之機能、二運銷方法之不良、交通不便運工費昂、且均假手寗商、受中間商人之操縱、如寗紹津滬市價每石約在五元與八元之間、而在平陽礬窯之出售實不過二元三角、三土製方法之不合、浪費礦質甚多、且副產品無法提取、盡行委棄、（按天津久大公司之黃海化學研究社已有平陽礬初步試騐出版專係研究礬渣副產物者）四滬港經售機關之剝削、</p>
<p>救濟方法　一由平陽縣政府集合煉窯、以地方政府名義請領執照、統制經營、二籌建　溪至藻溪支綫以接平陽泰順公路、三包裝等級應統一式樣、製煉方法、應設廠改良四另籌資金二十萬元設立產銷合作社、</p>

<h3>憲法草案關於中央政府的一章</h3>
<p>演講者立法委員陶脫謙</p>
<p>地點上海八仙橋青年會</p>
<p>－時間十一月十七日下午七時卅分－</p>
<p>［憲法草案關於中央政府的一章（第四章）］今晚、履謙承貴會之約、演講憲法草案、關於中央政府的一章、憲法問題本極複雜、而此章又為憲法草中最費斟酌最難規定者、全國均甚注意、報章批評、亦格外的多、立法院同人根據總理遺教、我國國情、以及世界趨勢、逐一虛心研究、稿凡六七易、始成最後的草案、若就本章條文上大致看去、亦祇於文從字順、應有盡有、並無任何新奇特別之處、值得演講、不過內中有幾點、往往惹起外間誤會、所以履謙趁此機會、專就這幾點加以說明、或者可以引起在座諸位先生的興趣、並且希望諸位先生不吝指教、</p>
<p>第一點　五權憲法之說、創自總理、世界各國、並無先例可循、即總理遺教、亦僅規定原則、而本章為五權精神及政權治權畫分的界限如何、各院間的關係如何、各院對國民大會的關係又如何、以及事實上有無窒礙、運用上是否便利、因此種種、我們固然不能把外國所謂總統制內閣制整個硬搬了來應用、也不能專就民國以來中央政制的變遷得失、來決定我們應採的方法、我們惟一的目標、是在不違背總理遺教精神的範圍以內、擬定一種中華民國的中央政制、使他一方面能夠實現五權分立的精神、一方面能夠適應我國實際上的需要、</p>
<p>第二點　本章的先決問題、就是總統應否兼攬行政實權、關於此點、各方意見紛歧、主張不一、有力主採用總統制者、亦有贊成內閣制者、其實一種制度、有利必有弊、決沒有絕對有利無弊的、我們在解決這個問題之先、第一、要認清在五權制下、五院同為治權關與立法機關形成對峙的現象者、截然不同、所以內閣制三字、根本上不能成立、第二、總理曾經說過、［五權憲法的行政首領、就是大總統、］又謂、［憲法制定之後、由各縣人民投票選舉總統以組織行政院、］照這樣看來、總理是主張總統應有實權的、是主張行政院由總統組織的、第三、世界政治的趨勢、在集中行政權、以求行政交率之增加、尤其是我國在此內裹外患紛至交信道編碼的時候、非予總統以行政實權、不足以資因應、根據上述三種理由。我們纔決定由總統總還行政權、關於行政院重要人員之進退、完全由總統主持、同時總統應對國民大會負責、因此按照憲革第四章內所規定、總統有兩種資格、第一種是元首資格、第二種是兼為行政首領的資格、也有兩種職權、第一種是元首的職權、（三十六至四十二條）第二種是因為總攬行政權而發生的職權、（四十四。四十五。五十六。五十八。五十九。六十各條）就表面上籠統看去、似乎是採用美國的決統制、但是事實上殊不盡然、美國總統、祇向國民負責、而不向國會負責、我國憲草、則規定總統向國民大會負責、而非空泛的向全國人民負責、此其不同之點一、美國總統、除因犯罪行為受衆院彈劾參院審判可以免職外、在任期未滿前、即使總統措置乘方、並無他法可資救濟、惟有俟其任滿不再推選而已、我國憲草、則規定罷免總統之權、操之國民大會、而其罷免之方式有二、一為國民大會自動的罷免、二為國民大會受理監察院彈劾案之結果而罷免、彈劾總統之權、屬於監察院、而其彈劾之事端亦有二、一為違法、一為失職、是總統被罷免之方式、較美制為多、其為彈劾之範圍、亦較美制為廣、此其不同之點二、茲更就德國制度一為比較、德國總統有任免行政院院長及各部部長之權、（德憲五十三條）此點與我憲草所規定者相同、惟德行政院院長及各部部長、須得聯邦國會之信任、若其中一員受國會決議不信任時、應即退職、（德憲五十四條）我國則行政院長及屬於行政院之各部會長官、祇對總統各自負責、總統可以自由任免、並無不信任權為之牽制、（五十六。五十八。五十九條）又德憲第四十三條規定、總統於任期未滿前、得由聯邦國會動議、以國民表決罷免之、此點為美所無、近於我國之國民大會自動罷免總統、但德須經全民表決、而我則國民大會本身即有最終決定權、不必訴諸全民、故無解散問題發生、可以減少政治上的紛擾、又德憲第五十九條規定、聯邦國會對於總統認為違憲或違法時、得代表聯邦向高等法院控告、我國則規定總統除犯內亂或外患罪應受刑事上之訴究外、其他違法失職情事、祇受監察院之彈劾、國民大會之審理、（第五十四條及第一百條）又與德憲顯有區別、概括言之、我國總統產生之方法、罷免之途徑、概括言之、我國總統產生之方法、罷免之途徑、負責之對象、以及職權之行使、與世界各共和國之現行制度、大都異其旨趣、絕不能混而為一、蓋各國所謂政府、多側重行政方面、我國則中央政府係由五院搆成、而五者同屬治權機關、合之為整個的政府、分之則各自獨立行使職權、合之為整個的政府、分之則各自獨立行使職權、不相侵越、果使總統得人、儘可於憲法賦予之權限範圍以內、發揮其手腕與能力、以求國家行政之積極推進、而無議會挾時掣肘之虞、然使總統而憑藉地位、違法侵權、則國民大會之罷免、監察院之彈劾、均可加以制裁、亦絕不能集五權於一身、致釀成專制獨裁之害、此則吾人所可預測者也、（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見難求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>賈多才道：是的呀，你大概還託過茶房要挾我吧？我姓賈。胡嫂子眼珠轉了兩轉，笑道：哦哦哦，是的，他們說過，在街上碰到一回賈老爺的，還多謝你，把他們送了回來呢。天黑了，我們家燈亮也不好，要不然，請賈老爺到我們家坐一會子去。賈多才道：你們不是要出門去嗎？胡嫂子道：喲！天都黑了，　我們還到那裹去呀。賈多才聽他說根本否認出門，大不高興，難道說，李士廉約著七點鐘燈下看美人，那是看鬼嗎？便冷笑道：你們這些人，都是口是心非的。我告訴你說，你們窮人既是想沾人家的光，一沒有知識，二沒有能耐，要靠人，這就得拿出一番誠心來。偏是學走還沒有學到，就要學跑，你不但是愚弄不到人，反呌人家好笑。這時候我且不說什麼，回頭我看你把什麼臉面見人？胡嫂子好意出來招待他，倒讓他蓋頭蓋臉罵上了一陣，也不由怒從心起。便咦了一聲道：賈老爺，你這是什麼話，我們好端端的，也沒有得罪你，你罵我作什麼？人不求人一般大，水不流來一樣平，我們窮我們的，只要一不偷你的，二不拿你的，有什麼見不得你，這不是怪話嗎？不錯，我是請小西天的茶房，求過你的，也沒有得著你什麼，犯得上見你低頭嗎？這胡嫂子究竟是個老向外邊跑的，說出這些話來，鬧得賈多才沒法再說什麼，於是將袖子一摔道：不和你這種無知識的東西說話。說畢，掉轉身就向小西天裹面走來。這在他，可以說是把買月英作妾的心事，完全斬斷了。（六七）</p>
<h3>南雁哀聲</h3>
<p>— 天南客</p>
<p>由於海外華僑人數的衆多。經濟力的富足，居然有人譽我國為［國弱民強］。其實華僑的數典而未忘共祖，總還得歸功於風雨如晦，鷄嗚不已的華僑教育罷。</p>
<p>［弱國無外交，］似已成了鐵律。現在似乎又進到［弱僑無教育］的境界了。不信，請看一位旅居暹羅的華校　教員的來信：</p>
<p>［……我在這渭南河上的常綠之國，伴著天真爛縵的僑童，怱怱已是四年了。想不到那同洲同種的暹羅蕞爾之邦，對我們的手段越來越兇。從前華文教員能暹語而不諳暹文，亦可［派司。］現在卻非有四年以上的暹文程度，不準註冊授課。……去年強迫華校每日須授暹文四小時，我們只好在課外偷教一小時的國語。最近暹羅教育部來一公文，強迫華校當局把七歲以上十四歲以下的華童，一概轉送暹文學校受課。華校不得收容。這樣一來，暹羅境內二百萬華僑所生的子女，不得不捨棄中文，純粹暹化了。他們要在十年內全部消滅華僑教育，正在雷厲風行呢！……］</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （一震）</p>
<p>天氣冷了，咱們老百姓，有個聽明的禦寒方法，就是［袖手］（把手指放在袖管裹，同時把兩肩扛了起來。）這個形態，委實難看，既沒有精神，而對於生理上也有妨礙。在目今新生活運動盛行之下，奉勸同胞，第一要把這個惡習慣破除了。</p>
<h3>愛的結晶</h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>某君那天跑到我的屋裹來，帶了臉的笑意，對我說：</p>
<p>［你知道嗎，我已經有了一個愛人了？］</p>
<p>我瞧著他的臉，意思是想看出他這話是不是嘲笑我，因為我在不久的時候，結識了一個活潑美麗的姑娘，曾經這樣對他說過：而現在，那姑娘走了，我正為著這件事類惱。我瞧了他好一會。覺得他的話並不是嘲笑我，於是我也欣悅的說：</p>
<p>［好！我為你們的前途祝福！］</p>
<p>於是他笑著走了。</p>
<p>幾天後，他又到我這裹來，還有著一個女人和他同來的。那女人，年青而美麗，微笑時嘴邊有兩個梨渦。經了他的介紹筆，我才知道那就是他的愛人。我得替我朋友歡喜。離走時，他低聲向我說：</p>
<p>［我和伊快要結婚了。到那時請你吃喜酒去。］</p>
<p>我笑著點頭。瞧著他們走遠了，心裹忽然浮起了一句話：我的愛人呢？伊走了哪！哪一天，我整天的不舒服，而且對他們這親愛的樣子竟然起了嫉妬。</p>
<p>此後，他們果然寄來了一張請帖，請我去吃喜酒，我沒有去。</p>
<p>這是五個月以後了，某君忽然蒞止。我急忙站起來，和他握手，並為他們新夫婦祝福。某君皺起眉頭，說！！罷啦！便拉我坐下。悽然的告訴我：</p>
<p>［還說伊呢？伊從前騙我沒和誰戀愛過，可是我和伊結婚剛五個月，伊就產下一個孩子來，還說是我們的愛的結晶；我一氣，便和伊離了婚了。］</p>
<p>我望著他：他眼裹閃著憤怒和悲痛交織著的淚光。</p>

<h3>一個銅元</h3>
<p>— 顏鑫泉</p>
<p>天空烏暗得成了深灰色，像要灑下雨水來的樣子。辦公室裹的五位朋友，為保持自己的目力計，把一切工作都停止了。因此一位姓汪的朋友，在這靜寂無聊的當中，徵得多數朋友的同意，開始說以下的一段故事。</p>
<p>從前有一個木行老關，有二百多萬的家財，生下三個兒子，大兒子有些獃氣，二兒子比較靈巧一點，也是好吃懶做，三兒子心計很好，一天，正是元旦的早晨，他給每個兒子一個銅元；大兒子接一銅元也不說什麼，二兒子接了銅元，心想：我何不把銅元存在父親那裹，每天對本對利支取利息呢？就請求父親照辦了：三兒子接了銅元，也要存在父親那裹，每天對本對利，利上加利，利息並不支取，祇待月終結算，父親也毫不思索的答應了。從此二兒子每天向父親支取利息買另食吃。光陰很快的過了一個月，三兒子來和父親結賑了。父親拿起算盤一算：一個銅元，每天利上加利，一天兩個，二天四個，三天八個，四天十六，五天三十二，…十天一千零二十四個，二十天一百零四萬八千五百七下六個，三十天十萬零七千三百七十四萬一千八百二十四個，再拿一塊錢作為三百個折算，須大洋三百五十七萬九千一百三十九元零，因此父親全部家財給三兒子外，還虧少兒子一百萬元的債呢！</p>
<p>世界珍間</p>
<p>— （黃影呆）</p>
<p>蜜蜂阻電車</p>
<p>在瑞典首都斯都哥爾摩地方，一處最熱鬧的街市之中，一輛電車為了前面的軌道上逗著一羣蜜蜂，便不能開過，大家沒有方法想，就是維持交通的警察，也想不出一個妥當的方法，能把蜜蜂趕走，而電車更委實沒有方法向前開去。齊巧在這時候，有一個店員，從一爿店裹走出來，拿了一桶的水，澆在蜜蜂的身上，蜜蜂著了水，便一起飛開，躲在到路旁一顆樹上去了。</p>
<p>最大的貓兒</p>
<p>傑勃遜是一頭倫敦的貓，據說是全世界最大的一頭貓，的確。它已造成了世界新世錄。因為現在已有三十五磅體重了。這頭貓有三十五吋寬的胸圍肩膀闊十四吋自頭至尾，長三十七吋，每一足掌。橫闊二吋。它的體重雖有這麼多，但它正和別的貓一樣，行動很敏捷爬梯子，跳上桌子，也是輕快得很。傑勃遜的確不是一頭平凡的貓，他的食量，也是不小，每天要吃一磅牛肉。</p>
<p>廿五年舊賬</p>
<p>傑斯查尼司，現在他是美國復興運動中的財政委員，他在二十五年之前，曾經向一個賣報童子，賒一份報紙，值五分錢。最近這個賣報童子，寫封信給他，說起二十五年前的舊賑，查尼司接到了這封信馬上寫封回信去，信內附兩角五分的美金，作算清償舊賑，照原欠加複利五倍。這個賣報童子，現在也是一個很富有的商人呢！</p>
<p>第一次肇禍</p>
<p>法國傅來的消息，說是有一個烏希脫島的上面，直到現在，還是第一次發生汽車肇禍案件。這島一共五哩長，一哩半寬，而全島之上，祇有汽車二輛。最近有一位鮑爾羅卡斯在大霧中駕駛一輛汽車，把他的表弟撞倒了，這是在那個小島上第一次汽車肇祝的紀錄。</p>
<p>不吃水婦人</p>
<p>紐約有一位米尼溫脫夫人，今年已有八十八歲了，可是自十四歲以後，直到現在，沒有吃過一滴水。屈指一算，已有七十四年，一個人七十四年不吃水，的確是一件奇事。據說伊的父親因為多飲了燙水，便害病而死了，從此之後，伊便決定不再飲水。代水的東西，平時飲咖啡不拘冷熱。但在夜晚，伊是不飲冷咖啡的，有時也飲牛奶。</p>
<p>鴿子上學校</p>
<p>巴比拉有一所小學校中，幾個小學生有一樣愛物！便是一頭鴿子，每天會跟了孩子上學校。孩子們早上到學校裹去，這頭鴿子也跟到學校裹，甚至飛到教室裹躲在課桌上；下課了，孩子們走到外面，鴿子也飛到外面；上課了，孩子們重回課室，鴿子立刻飛來。午後散學，鴿子隨孩子回家，星期日孩子們不來上學，這鴿子也不飛來了。</p>
<p>懶惰可離婚</p>
<p>蒲地伯息消息匈牙利最高法院，最近受理一件案子：一個妻子為了伊的丈夫懶惰而要求離婚終於得到勝訴也是離婚案上開了一個新紀錄。這個妻子，說伊的丈夫是一個煙店商人，對於他的業務是太玩忽了。當伊很忙碌的在操作家務的時候，伊的丈夫，會把店門關起來，和別人談天，所以要提出離婚。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因為北京皇宮的建築，差不多是和它完全相同的，而且是更曲折，更繁複，我們只須看了它入門處的景象，已可以知道了。</p>
<p>在我們自己所歇息的兩座偏殿和太后所居住的那座正殿的中間，也同樣的夾著一個絕大的庭院；在這庭院中，有許多丁香花種著，白色的也有，紫色的也有，開得都很茂盛。可是他們所發出來的那般氣味，卻委實難受：既不香，又不臭，只是說不出的難聞。聞得我頓時覺得非常的頭痛，幸而它的顏色是特別的淡雅清麗，像一個淡裝素抹的美人一樣的可愛；依我個人的嗜好來說，這種花實在比牡丹花芍藥花等可愛得多。所以我想只要再過一兩天，我對於它所發出來的那股臭味必能因愛好它的色調而漸漸地不覺得難聞了。真的，後來我居然習慣了，否則我們在奉天逗留著的幾天中，這股臭味不分晝夜的來侵襲我的鼻孔，我還能不病倒嗎？（一七七）</p>

<h3>史高塔杯初賽優游淘汰猶太</h3>
<p>羅海光獨立三功</p>
<p>五比二總結全局</p>
<p>優游與猶太之史高塔杯初賽、先以五比五和局、未決勝負、西聯會擇於昨日在逸園重賽、仇人相見、分外眼紅、故表演雖少精彩、但競爭異常劇烈、優游主人程貽澤親自到塲觀戰、三軍奮發、不辱使命、卒以五比二淘汰猶太、上半時二比零、羅海光獨建三功、梅洪賣王南珍奮發有為、勇於往日、鍾勇森改任內鋒、接濟有功、函錦順射擊不準、失機無算、否則比數當不止此、中衛綫頗稱盡職、王樹森穩健勝於江善敬、老江腳頭漫無標的、往往力已用足、球去不遠、方向不準、但猶不愧一員勇將、徐亨手法漸熟、將復原狀、敵軍守門救出險球不少、內衛禿頂好萊斯丁保駕有功、冠於濟輩、中鋒勃林蓋、右內衛潘切克、左翼Ｓ葛林勃、均善戰之將、全隊聯絡亦佳、奔路迅速、宜其初次戰成平手也、</p>
<p>城池堅固</p>
<p>兩軍陣圓、猶太先攻、初以塲地濘滑、行動略感不便、往後習以為常、倒也不覺困苦、炭弟揮軍殺進、小梅老孫各有打門不中、猶太乘優游角球失利之後、引軍追殺、聲勢洶洶、前鋒一字擺開、包抄而來、幸小鬍子雲逢霧在亂軍中奪圍而出、救出阿斗、輸送前方、勇森在門角發射、竟然不中、移時、海光半途殺入、交球鐵腿、老孫迎之以頭、被敵將擋出、王南珍候在門下、乘勢加上一腳、以為必中敵門、詎料操之過急、一飛沖天、猶太乃得再度進兵、深入營壘、潘切克攻門中柱、險極險極、你來我往、名無建樹、</p>
<p>海光連中</p>
<p>優游攻門甚急、苦不能下、二十五分鐘時、梅洪實美妙傅中、孫錦順接住、轉送羅海光、羅竄前一步、怒射入門、紀錄遂開、勝負既分、形勢略見緊張、老孫得勇森接濟、匹馬單槍、殺入番營、以為敵門指日可下、不意射成野球、四座嗟嘆、激戰少時、梅洪寶偷渡挑送、王南珍與禿頂好來斯丁三次頭頂、球落海光腳下、出其不意、再立一功、此後王南珍在右門角一次側射甚佳、可惜不中、</p>
<p>投桃報李</p>
<p>休息再戰、形勢更盛於前、優游誓滅番軍、猶太力圖復城、你奪我搶、各不相讓、王南珍送出角球、海光勇森門前連射兩次、球急如矢、但均為守門救出、觀者無不讚黨賞、但勇森心有不甘、帶球再進、以疑兵誘敵、搶過兩關、偷空一腳、離門有二十碼左右、平地下三城、煊嚇一時、猶太不甘雌伏、反攻愈烈、五鋒包抄而至、勃林蓋攻門阻回、右翼格林勃一腳中鵠、奪回一寨、</p>
<p>又中兩球</p>
<p>猶太至此、頗具雄心、奮力夾攻、無如優游防禦嚴密、伏兵滿佈、無懈可擊、炭弟坐鎮中原、敵軍喪膽、小鬍子勇冠三軍、當者披靡、老孫大賣牛力、闖出番營、國地位不當、不能攻門、即鉤至前方、海光在門前接得、敵軍遲疑不前、海光踏定從容發射、飛入門內、美麗可喜、梅洪竇兵出斜谷、奮勇當先、誘避敵人、直達底綫、傅球中樞、老孫趕至門下、不加思索、拉起一腳、搗破敵門、遂以五比一穩取勝勢、</p>
<p>暗中摸索</p>
<p>猶太至此、全軍無不怒形於色、前鋒五將、東闖西衝、急切中難得機會、時陰雲密佈、昏天黑地、遙望祇見人影隱隱移動、不見球影、雙方在暗中摸索、不知所云、剎那間、潘切克率領土卒、衝到優游腹地、徐亨來門殺球、中敵奸計、勃令蓋因亦衝至門下、不及轉身、竟用足跟將球倒撥、敲入綱底、成五比二之結果、</p>

<h3>從贛南新復匪區中之救護工作談到公家施診制（四）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周先生講陳生白江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>一高等麻醉藥品，譬如像novocain之類，二注射劑，都是急於需用面購安瓿裝就的。三補品，補品裹像魚肝油，竟常用的藥品。提到魚肝油，我到有點感想。就是在上海一般的布爾喬亞，他些魚肝油，功效極不易見，甚至吃精煉的維他命製劑，也不見到功效。可是在江西的匪區和災區，卻不是這樣。我實騐災區患營養缺乏的民衆，祇要服用魚肝油二百cc，馬上立見功效，食慾驟增，精神亦振，連吃數天，就可以嚥下其他的食料。論魚肝油的價值。約售十六元一箱，那麼平均拿一角多錢，竟可以救一個垂斃的人。我們在都市裹生活的人，平時養尊處優，也許要有點感觸吧。其次講到延用的人才，計有國外留學的及正式醫校畢業的醫師，和二十元以上薪金的各級護土。共達二○六人。最大的薪水，醫師也有每月二三百元者。還包括到其他的醫用器械，和雜用開銷。而平均每個病人，方始需要上述每號四角的代價。</p>
<p>可是我覺得上面所講的四角錢的代價，對於大規模的公醫，還覺得不經濟。在這里再舉出幾個不經濟的原因：第一急就的浮費太多，第二沒有研究到藥品的代價昂貴。第三短期的事業有許多不可節省的開支，及川資的消耗。第四短期聘請醫師每多高薪。第五內地物質供應困難，和運輸費的消耗。第六結束時醫用器械的消失。第七單位太多。假定說我們有了固定的組織，免去意外的消耗，那末，一定可以減去了很大的數目。</p>
<p>三現在再將專施門診的濟羣，高行，川南，廣昌四種醫務，做一個統計，當更有比較合乎經濟的事實出現。</p>
<p>總計四醫院共診的號數，為一三萬九千九百八十六人，而所用的欵子為二萬七千二百四十一元。平均每號病人的代價，是一角九分四厘。這不是已經又減少了嗎？</p>
<p>倘使我們再免去上述可以減省的七項理由，並參考以下兩醫院的藥費的開支，我們更可以找出一個更合經濟的辦法。</p>
<p>（甲）急救時疫醫院共診八萬六千二百十六人。共用藥費三千八百十二元。平均每號藥資四分四厘。</p>
<p>（乙）川南醫院共診四萬馀人，共用藥費一千五百九十元，平均每號藥費三分五厘。</p>
<p>從上面兩個醫院的統計，我們可以得到每人平均藥資為四分，再從經騐上知道，醫費大概是藥費的三分之二為標準，那末，我們拿醫藥費合計起來，也不過每號一角二分。所以我認為這樣的做起來，要舉行永久的施診，並不是一件難事。並且照我的計算，已經是很高貴的醫務了。決不會使一個正式醫師缺乏興趣而不屑為的了。</p>
<h3>談病理原虫（三）</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>這一類在靜的時候呈著球形的原虫，因為牠們沒有甚麼外殼或肉骨來固定牠們的本身質地，所以牠們的動作，是非常的靈便，隨便牠們想要什麼動，就什麼動，向南向北四面八方並沒有一些的阻礙，但是除了這僅僅占著少數的裸體原虫之外，其馀的原虫，大都終有些固體的質物，在牠們的外部或內部，好比是牠們的骨格一樣，有些呢原形質的表面包著一層硬殼，這外殼都是原形質的變體，但是硬席方面，不是個個相同，一方要看那原虫所處的環境如何，一方當然要看是那一種的原虫而定，這個外殼有時也會變硬變軟，並且也可以用人工的力量利用化學品，或是更換牠們的食料等的方法使牠們起變化有時竟然會可以完全消滅牠而變成沒有外殼的原虫。像這樣的外殼因為原虫本身已經可以使得牠存在或消滅吾們可以稱牠謂一種［活殼］。這活殼的本身形狀，當然不必都是圓形的，蛋形的螺鏇形的以及其他的形狀，多得了不得，有時吾們可以一種原虫的形狀竟然可以使吾們奇怪起來，甚樣會變成了這樣一件花妙的東西可以感動人們的美感更希奇牠們的本身一共也不過一個細胞而成的。</p>
<p>有些原虫為了特種的關係，要保護牠們的本身，或者要經過一種繁殖時的階級，原來沒有外殼的原虫，也會生一層殼樣的東西出來，但是往往把全身一起包完，不漏一孔，所以吾們可以不當牠是一種外殼。</p>
<p>因為上面所說的外殼，講到形狀方面，大大的不同，大都不是直別別的一層而已，許多的所謂外殼，會具有特種的生理作用，當作吸著器用的乳頭形就是許多形狀中的一種，其他尖的長的圓的形狀不知尚有多少，上面所說的活殼之外，許多原虫的身體，帶著死的硬質，這些物質，原來就是牠們自己排泄出來的，我呌這些東西是死的，因為牠們不會像上面的活殼一樣的或有或無的起變化，所以用此類質地所成的外殼，我就呌牠做［死殼］，這樣的死殼，往往不把原虫的一身一起包滿，而往往留著一處，可以伸出或看得牠們的原形質來的，但是這一類的原虫都是沒有病理的作用的。</p>
<p>尚有一部份的原虫外邊倒並沒有硬軟的殼子，也是赤祼裸的像沒有固質的原虫一樣，但是牠們的外形並不見若何的變動，或有若何的長短的變化，其原因是在牠們的內部。含有支持這形體的物體，吾們時常看見有些的原虫，從牠們的核子，生出了單數或多數的柔軔性的細絲，好像含有彈力性的絲綱一樣，這些細絲，往往能穿到原形的外面，在運動的時候，好像舟槳式的幫助牠們的動作，這一類的東西，往往完全當作一種持用的紉帶，原來那些原虫的身，以前已經說過，是一種膠樣的物質，存在這膠質內的物體，在膠質流動的時候，不免也隨著而流動，而更動牠們的位置，如果有了這些的紉帶式的東西，有許多不需動的物質，就可以被這帶形的細絲撐柱不動，所以原虫的當作口腔以及肛門用的小空等處，我們都可以找到此類的物質，其作用就是要牠們張開與關閉的自由而不使原虫的行動，亦具有特動的情形，牠們的工具有些臨時生足，要向那邊走的時候，那邊就生出一只足來，這足當然是一種假足，不過一部份的原形質凸了出來就是了，牠的身子就隨了足的方向縮了一縮，就進了一步，像原虫的身體，也含有若干種度的彈性一樣。原來膠形狀的物質，確實是有多少的彈力性，這是我們都曉得的，這些假足的形狀，當然在各種的原虫類各自不同的，指形的絲形的枝形的，吾們可以常常看見的亦有許多的假足中部存有中柱式的東西，但是亦有原虫不伸出甚麼足來，光靠了原形質的流動而流動。</p>
<h3>勸各地醫師公會舉辦同道間經濟互助</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>最近接到宋忠鈺醫師的一封信，大意如下：</p>
<p>［我是在軍醫學校畢業的，畢業後因無力開業，曾當小學教員數年，嗣為某醫院所聘，言明月薪三十元，及至到院服務，該院止給十元，經交涉後，始增加至十五元，我因該院之無信，遂毅然退出，借賣稿來維持生活，但是杯水車薪，終屬無濟於事，現在典質已盡，惟有懇求同道加以援助］云云。</p>
<p>我看完以後，覺得異常難受，因此感覺到醫生的生活是毫無保障的了！一般社會人士，以為醫生總是一種優厚的職業，醫生是資產階級，因此少數的修養不足者對於醫生發生一種［羨］與［妬］的心理。要知此種觀察是錯誤的，醫生之中也儘有無飯可喫的，受著環境的壓迫而至於告貸無門的。像宋君這樣，並不止一二個，我接到這樣的信也不止一次。春中還有比宋君更貧苦的，社會祇看到一方面，而另一方面則沒有看到，所以有這樣錯誤的觀察。</p>
<p>在六年前，全國醫師聯合會在滬開會的時候。我曾經有個提案，提案的內容是說如何救濟一班失業的，貧舊的老病的，死亡的同道，我的意思是主張由各地醫師公會的會員，每年每人繳費若干，儲蓄起來，專為救濟這班貧苦的同道，或同道死亡後的家屬，這種辦法，我名之曰［經濟互助］。當時是通過了議決了！但至今未見實行，想早已束之高閣，付諸決而不行的案件中了！現在，我因為看到宋君的來信，想起我這個辦法，我覺得同情心是人人應有的，更何況加上同道的關係呢？我仍然希望各地的醫師公會實行我這個辦法，直接可以救濟貧苦的同道，使醫生的生活得到一種保障，間接也可以為社會上減少一些無飯可吃的人，不也是造福人羣的一道嗎？</p>
<h3>意外糾紛記</h3>
<p>— 顧宗文</p>
<p>余自民國十年辭去蘇州省立醫院職務後。來滬創立樹德醫院。荏苒流光。忽忽已十有三年。雖不能自翊對於社會有若何貢獻。治療方面有若何成績。但自信診病用藥。無不謹慎從事。對於病家。以負責治療為天職。十馀年來。幸無遺誤。此乃歷年曾受治於鄙人之病家所共見也。最近余因勇於救治一卒中病人。至遭意外糾紛。今將當時事實縷述如下。</p>
<p>本月五日下午一時半。余正在院診病之際。有電話至。助手訽之。據稱潘</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>姓。居住東蒲石路二百十二號。患急癥。昏仆倒地。請火速來診。余卽乘汽車趕往診視。當見病人由數人扶掖。坐於床邊。陷於高度昏睡狀態。余卽命彼等速扶病人平臥。而使頭部稍高。詢侍者經過情形。得悉患者三日前起。當有頭痛頭暈。未加醫治。半小時前。病又復發。覺頭昏劇烈。不能拾起。遂步入臥室。覺頭昏劇烈。不能拾起。遂步入臥室。以圖靜養。不料行至床前。忽跌仆倒地。頓時不省人事。經夥友得悉。卽扶住踵躍約歷年半小時。神色大變。始打電話來院。招請出診等情。余按其脈博。微弱幾不能觸知。而呼吸亦頻於停止現象。余當時即聲言病已無救。惟店夥一再懇求救治。余為熱心所驅。迅卽為其注射可拉明（coramine）強心劑兩針。以冀挽救於萬一。但終以請診過遲。不及救治而死。斯時潘妻適不在店。余之助手向店夥收取診金針費。而彼等均不負責。余因診務關係。先生返院。當時余曾對其夥友聲言。如經濟困難。不妨體恤減少。孰意潘妻回店。見丈夫已死。不願履行報酬醫藥費之義務。乃聽從隣人之計。報告捕房。謂余所乃之針。恐有不當。或含有毒質。嗣經捕房派員調查。將注射藥空瓶送交法醫檢查。翌日由法院委派王任檢察官及魏姜二法醫詳細檢騐之下。認為潘金桃委係急病身死。醫師並無過失。乃各報記者。紛紛取材於病家。以訛傅訛。謂病者於注射後。尚能喚呼啊嚇一聲等詞。此全係傅聞失實。蓋病人早已神志昏迷。不能言語。則注射後何能再行喚呼。此乃潘妻自知情虛。恐坐诬告處分。不得不於檢察官前故作是謊言耳。總之。醫師為人治病。無不冀其治愈。既得榮譽。又盡天職。若不幸而不治。抑且同悲。今潘姓所患係卒中。且卒中癥之最劇烈者。名曰電擊中風。當跌仆倒地時。若迅速救治。或尚有希望。惟夥友毫無醫學常識。反扶住踵躍。使腦出血部分破壞愈廣。以致無救。其咎由自誤。明逹者固能洞鍳及之。惟日來新知舊交。來函或用電話垂詢者。日有數起。盛情高誼。至深銘感。因草此意外糾紛記。藉明事實真相云爾。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四十五）胃潰瘍（上）</p>
<p>問什麼呌做胃潰瘍？</p>
<p>答這是胃黏膜面因一定的原因而起潰蝕的病。</p>
<p>問怎樣會起胃潰瘍？</p>
<p>答大概因為胃黏膜的一局部陷於營養障礙，致組織失了抵抗力，於是受胃液的消化而起破壞潰爛。也有因為胃出血，動脈硬變，血管收縮，貧血，外傷，火傷等而發生的。</p>
<p>三這種病和遺傅有沒有關係？</p>
<p>答胃潰瘍逐漸擴大的要約，和遺傅及體質確有關係。</p>
<p>問胃潰瘍的發生，在胃內那一部分的黏膜最多？</p>
<p>答在小彎部或幽門部最多。</p>
<p>問潰瘍的形狀和大小怎樣？</p>
<p>答大都為圓形或橢圓形，大小從豌豆大起逹直徑十公分到十五公分的也有。</p>
<p>問潰瘍發生後，胃壁有沒有被破壞的危險？</p>
<p>答陳舊的潰瘍，往往破壞肌層，逹漿液膜，甚至穿孔，而傷及腹膜或近隣的器官。</p>
<p>問病人覺有什麼病狀？</p>
<p>答有些患胃潰瘍的病人，完全自己不覺得怎樣；直到死後解剖時纔偶然發見的。普通有著明的胃癥狀，像胃的持續性壓迫胃痛，曖氣，嘔吐等。有些人，突然胃內出血或立刻起穿孔性腹膜炎的。總之，患胃潰瘍的固有癥狀是胃痛問兼胃內出血，胃酸過多，胃運動障礙，胃內的潛出血等。</p>
<p>問胃潰瘍時的胃痛，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>答先起，漫性的胃壓迫感，尤其在食後或運動後。其後起限局性而固有的劇烈胃痛。痛的情形有灼熱樣，穿刺樣，痙攣樣等，在食後或經過一二小時發生。尤其在吃了粗硬不消化的食物後，更痛得利害，疼痛大多在心窩部，（所以有［心痛］的俗名）或有放散到臍窩部，背部腰部等的。</p>
<p>問胃潰瘍時的壓痛怎麼樣？</p>
<p>答這類壓痛，有一定的部位。有時用指端置潰瘍部的腹面上，就覺得疼痛。又有壓在脊柱左側第十到第十二胸椎間，有壓痛點。又在第七到第九胸椎橫斷區的領域內，有皮膚的知覺過敏帶。</p>
<p>問嘔葉的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>答嘔吐，是胃潰瘍患者屢起的癥狀，在吃了消化不良的食物後起的。所以食物中含有食物殘屑，呈強酸性反應。吐物中混有血液，這是在胃潰瘍診斷上最重要的癥狀之一。（未完）</p>
<h3>發熱普通治療法（八）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>一，額上放冷濕布</p>
<p>這是一種最普通的方法。將一條中等大小毛巾從冷水或冰水內扭出，疊成數摺，放在額上。一溫暖了再換一個。這種簡單的手術無論什麼發熱病人都可以用。就是這種很平常的方法也很可以減云發熱人的頭痛，並且可以鎮靜他的心神。這是與病人完全無害的。也有一件須注意的就是無論何種水療退熱法都是要病人頭冷腳熱。腳若是不溫暖可將兩腳放在一盆熱水中。</p>
<p>二，濕被單包身</p>
<p>這是一種很平和很有用的退熱法。就是病很沉重的也合用。方法，就是用一濕被單摺起將病人身包在內。包的部分由兩肩到膝。小孩子可用一大毛巾照法行。被單或毛巾須從冷水內扭出（約華氏表六十度）。在濕被單外包一乾毛氈。病人熱度在一百○四度的每兩小時換濕被單一次。熱度在一百○五度的每小時換一次。熱度一降到一百○二度以下就拿去濕被單。若是一個人是長期發熱以上的度數可低一度，卽一百○四度的每步時一換，一百○三度的每兩小時一換，如此類推。若是到換濕被單時濕被單還有熱可不必換。起始若皮膚冷可先用一芥茉水浸濕被單包身（法詳後）。</p>
<p>病勢如果沉重或病人很軟弱，可用以下的方法：卽病人仰臥，將一濕被單摺好蓋在身體從胸到太腿及身兩旁，上蓋一乾毛氈。這樣換濕被單時可不必動病人。小孩子與神經易激動的，第一次可將被單放在溫水內（約九十度），扭出包病人。後來每次換濕被單水溫度低五度。如此由溫漸冷，痛人可免受激刺。如此行直到熱度降到一百○三度以下。病人若覺著冷可多蓋被氈。這種濕被單退熱法對於神經錯亂，失眠的發熱病人有很大的益處。病人若睡著了可讓他睡不必給他換。</p>
<p>芥茉濕被單法就是用熱水（一○五度）加芥茉粉。每兩磅水用一調羹芥茉粉。芥茉是一種激刺皮膚的東西！！就是呌皮膚發紅發熱。被單從芥茉水內扭出包法與濕被單同，不過頸項處外面的毛氈要特別圍好免芥茉氣激刺眼鼻。病人包好後每五分鐘要看一看皮膚發紅與否。大約二十至三十分鐘就發紅。皮膚一發紅發熱了就可用冷濕被單包身。末一發紅發熱了就可用冷濕被單包身。末了可用清水將皮膚上的芥茉粉洗凈。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（二十九）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>現在我們可以回到肺結核癥本身了！他在病灶部分的組織，是由含氣的狀態而漸變為無氣的，或一種萎縮的情形，這是和尋常的氣管枝炎癥不同的。在這種部分行打診手續，大概是發現濁音的。但這種狀態並不是劃一的；尤其在初期的本癥，他在患側一方的音響，有時反較他側為高，甚至發生鼓音的。在聽診方面所得的結果，不外二途：一為呼吸音的變化，二為水泡音的發生。最初的時候，肺胞音是比較微弱，粗糙，而不純情粹；有時吸息時幽微輕弱，而呼息時則稅利而延長的：或且是作斷續呼吸聲的。到了發生氣管枝音的時候，我們可以曉得，這部分的組織是完全無氣的了；打診方面的濁音，也是明顯異常的。本病之發生水泡音，大多數是屬諸開放性，對於閉鎮性的本病，幾乎是絕無僅有的。他的水泡音種類雖多，然大抵是濕性的；像見於氣管枝火哮喘等癥的乾性水泡音，類鼾吹笛等，在此處是很少見的。他和氣管枝火癥的區別；就是：本癥的水泡音，大概是限於局部的，並且在每天檢查都很固定的；氣管枝炎癥則在兩肺上下都散在廣佈的，特殊是在肺下葉顯著的。如果本病是在進行的話，他的水泡音範圍，也會一同蔓延的。根據上列的種種情形，我們不妨下個斷語：就是：如果在肺的一部分，同時有了打診音響，和呼吸音的變化，以及水泡音的發生，這三種癥象一個不缺的話；那末，對於此處之為急性侵潤變化，是絲毫沒有疑問的。這祇須經過打診聽診的檢查就可以然的。病人主觀癥象既無須口述，其他的檢查手續更可省去的。讀者們因此也可明瞭，這打診聽診的手續，在本病的診斷上，是如何重要的了！（未完）</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十四）實扶的里（俗稱白喉）（續）</p>
<p>在下一期（二十三）當中。我已經說明實扶的里可以分為三種，就是咽頭實扶的里，鼻腔實扶的里，和喉頭實扶的里。這二種實扶的里的原因，雖然同是由於實扶的里桿菌的接濟傅案，但是因為他發生的部位。各有不同。所以他的癥候。亦因此而各有異。現在姑且先把三種實扶的里的癥候。各各順次講一講</p>
<p>一咽頭實扶的里rachendiphtherie</p>
<p>普通一般人稱作白喉的時候。大半都是指著這種咽頭實扶的里而言。因為他的局部病灶。只在扁桃腺和咽頭的兩處，所以病家自己或醫者比較的容易發見，不過常常悮將扁桃腺炎當作本病。或主悮將本病當作扁桃腺炎。這是因為患著扁桃腺火的時候。也有白點或被膜的緣故。其實遇著可疑的時候。儘可用顯微鏡來檢查一下。究竟有無實扶的里桿菌的存在。這是狠容易解決的一件事體。也就是新醫診病確實的一點。我曾診得狠多的病家。大都已經受過一二次的治療。有的是將扁桃腺炎當作實扶的里來醫治。雖然已經注射實扶的里血清。但是還不能立刻見效。反而失卻病家對於血清的信仰心。有的是將實扶的里當作扁桃腺炎來醫治。一再遷延時日。錯過血清治療的良機。卒至無法挽回生命而亡。這才真是寃哉枉也。造成這種不幸的結果。雖是醫者直接的錯悮。但是間接也因病家缺乏醫學常識的緣故。</p>
<p>本病的潛伏期。大概為二日至七日。也有只須數小時。他的咽頭癥候。是因疾病的輕重。而各有不同。在輕癥的時候。又可別為義臘性和腺窩性的兩種（未完）</p>

<h3>我國內國市塲之檢討</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>幾個月之前，我們在報上常聽說當局正計劃開發國外市塲，促進輸出貿易，在常年入趨恐佈之下的吾儕小民，聽到這種清感，不啻看作福音，天天等著他的表現。後來果然表現了，在七月底，公佈了修改出口稅則，在新出口稅則中，將出口品分成免稅，輕稅，增稅，三種，免稅的酒等二十馀種，輕稅的有蛋等十馀種，增稅的有煙豆等數種，據當局的說明，這是獎勵出口的手段，復興國內產業的法門。雖則，我們在免稅部份，並不能發現其中主要的出口商品；所有的僅只是那些次要的商品；將過去的從最稅制改為從價稅制，這就算是輕稅；其實也不過以免受無妄的損害而已。至於增稅，那目的大概只怕全國同胞沒有煙吸，所以非提高其出口稅率，禁止其出口而已。總而言之，確已善哉善哉！令吾人感戴不盡了。但八月初，新進口稅則公佈了。當未公佈之前，大家都以為這次修正總與修已出口稅的意義相同的；換一句話說，便是獎益我國產業，救濟過去在對外貿易上的失敗，所以輕免出口稅；而對進口稅，必然再酌量的提高。豈知結果有些不同，那也無庸多說。但是開發國外市塲的結果是怎樣呢？本年八九月份的出口卻反較去年跌落，而開放國內市塲的成績是怎樣呢？本年八九月份的進口貿易，非特沒有比去年增加，卻反在減退。開放海關，而進口仍然減少，這似乎我國的國貨，在國內市塲上已有自然抑制舶來品特能力，那是一件何等可喜的事實？但事實究否如此？不幸得很！剛剛相反，只為大衆購買力較前更衰退的結果所致。而大衆購買力的衰退，便中國內產業破產的結果。當局［想］而且［說］復興我國的產業，其意可敬；可惜所用的手段，不要講論，但引別國的經騐做我們的教訓，不論是英美日本，他們發展產業的第一個步驟，便是保留著自己的國內市塲，讓幼稚的農工商品，作活動的基礎。等幼稚的農工業建壯了，強大了，便打出關外去，和別的國的商品在世界市塲上爭雄。從沒有當自己的產業尚未健全，便將驅之以與強者角力，所有的，只有惟我獨尊了。但到什麼時候才糾正過來呢？只是一個未知數哩！</p>
<p>未知數也有未知數的好處，因為我卻可以在開發這個未知數的名義之下，來寫文章了。我預備從檢討國內市塲的現狀中，來反映這開放政策的成敗，究竟有些什麼結果？假使我這文章得到讀者的歡心，那豈不還可以得到一筆稿費來買洋貨？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>本年二月十四日，上海日文報的每日新聞曾載近年來中國的貿易狀況一段統計字數。那裹說：中國的對外貿易總值，在一九三二年是三十三萬七千馀萬元，那時的國內貿易總值不過是十一萬八千馀萬元，但到了去年，對外貿易總值已幾乎減落到和三一年代國內貿易的情形相等。而國內貿易呢，已只有九成萬三千馀萬了，關於國內貿易的數字，根據什麼材料而統計出來的，固然難於捉摸其正確的程度，但由進口貿易與入超數字的開始激減了三年的事實，國內貿易的正在極度衰落中，那已是無可爭議的事實了。</p>
<p>要正確的調查內國市塲的現狀，阿彌陀佛，我們簡直毫無方法可進行。但是在沒有材料的材料之中，我們也可以從各地內匯市塲及商業破產現象這兩點做根據，而找出一個相當明確的概念來。</p>
<p>匯市的興衰，是商業興衰的一個間接上的氣象臺。如果商業繁榮，那末貨幣的流通遠度，必然增高，於是各地的匯市也就熱鬧起來。在相反的塲合，那末匯市也就清淡了。匯市熱鬧的時候，不比如甲地的商業繁榮，過於乙地，那末乙地對甲地的匯價必然會商漲起來。在相反的塲合，便出現相反的結果。中國各地的商業，很可以上海對各地的滙市做中心而觀察的。因為各地的輸出入，大都和上海有密切的關係。為了便於說明起見，我們還得分華北華中華獻一個部份來分別觀察。</p>
<p>上海對華北的內匯，近幾年來無不激減。而激減之鉅，又較別部份大，在華北部份，試分出口岸商埠如天津，青島，煙臺等，內地都市如北平，太原，石家荘，張家口等。</p>
<p>上海對華北口岸商埠的匯市，在二十年，上海要付出一千零七元八角，在天津才可以領得一千元。但在本年八月份，上海只須付出領得一千元。但在本年八月份，上海只須付出九百九十八元，在天津便可以收得一千元了。說得明白些，上海的商人，想向天津買進一千元的貨物，那末在二十年份，須在上海銀行裹付出一千零七元八角，天津的賣主便能如數收到一千元的貨價。但現在，上海商人只須匯出九百九十八元，天津的賣主，就可以得到一千元的貨價了，換句話說，就是滬津的匯市，已自一○○七，八跌至九九八了。粗看似乎只是真於銀元信用與價值的變化，其實那也由於匯單清淡的結果啊！津滬如此，別地亦何不如是。如在同一期間，滬青已由一。○○二跌至一。○○○。二；如滬煙更由一。○○五。六跌至一。○○○了。至於對於內地都市呢？那末滬平也自一。○○三。三跌至九九八；滬太也自一。○○四。一跌至一。○○○了。滬石也自一。○○四。八跌至一。○○○了。滬張也自一。○○四。七跌至一。○○○了。總之，無一不跌。或者有人傅說，華北的商業，向與上海的關係，並不真的十分密切，他們重要的出入口於是天津，大連等地。那末很好，我們就看鄭州對天津的匯市，民二十一年是一。○○九。○五；今年八月已只消九九九。三六了，再舉別地，也不過多占入世篇幅了。</p>
<p>現在我們再來看：上海對華中各埠的情形，華中各埠如漢口。九江。安慶。蕪湖。南昌。蚌埠。杭州。南京等，他們的商務，和上海的關係，較別處更深。因為他們的出入必經之道幾全在上海，可是在近四年的匯市卻也同樣的大跌特跌。如滬杭；由二十年的一，○○一。五跌至一。○○○。五；在這同期間，滬京自一。○○一。跌為一。○○○。二；滬蕪自一。○○四。一跌為一。○○○。二；滬慶自一。○○四。三跌為一。○○○。二。滬蚌自一。○○三。一跌至一。○○一。五，滬昌自一。○○四。一跌為一。○○三。九，但是上海對九江的匯市卻較前反增，二十年是九九五。八，現在卻要一。○○三。三，置什麼原故呢？那就因南昌做了剿匪總部的和地營；物質的享受，都希望從上海送去，九江是南昌的咽喉；貨物的吞吐，都要從九江出入，因此滬九的匯市便高漲起來，換句話說，滬九的商業關係，便較前熱鬧起來了。但僅僅只有他一地如此，旁的都衰落，如漢口，雖然也有副司令的行轅，卻在同一期間，也自一，○○六。二，至，○○三。三了。</p>
<p>最後我們來看對華南的關係，那末除廣州和瓊州兩地之外，其他都一律減落。該地增高的原因，前者或可以由軍費呈財政補助上去解釋，後者呢，或許是華僑與旅滬瓊籍學生滙欵的關係。對廣州，二十年是六一○，今年八月卻增為一。○○二，對瓊州自一。○○八。六，激增至二。○一二。一。此外在同期間，對汕頭跌落四十七元四；對福州跌落十一元；對廈門跌落十五元八角。</p>
<p>這種內匯上的變動，當然不單是由於商務關係與興衰所造成的結果，各地政治上的影響，各地貨幣信用的變動，也足以有力地支配著匯市的，那末，很好，我們不妨再搜求別種材料來證實各地的商業，確然在大衰特落。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>商業繁榮的時候，商店不會大批關門：這是大家都知道的。那末有大批商店關門的時候，便不能不承認那是由於商業衰落的結果了。那末，現在怎樣呢？不幸的很，各地都有大批的商店在關門。</p>
<p>譬如上海，誰都知道是全國最互繁華的區域，但是近年來，金迷紙醉的人，眼看著大減價旗簾的到處飛揚，不免都已感到營業槍條的氣色。馬路上無論行人依然那麼多，但各商店，還是無法把他們拉成自己的主顧，撐住他們關上來的鐵門，據本年一月二十二日每日新聞說：上海在廢曆正日以後，倒閉的商店已多至三百家，我們僅僅根據中行月刋八卷，期至九卷四期中關於踐業人事記來統計，本年內首八個月中，倒閉的大行家荘舖達五十三家，倒欠錢荘的變項，達九百四十六萬馀元。除商店之外，還有絲廠，還有銀行，還有錢荘。絲廠停工者，今日已占總數五分之四，銀行關門者有中興，華僑信社，五華，等總分行八九處，錢荘更不得了，今年上市的據中行月刋說，不過七十一家；但在首七個月中，關門的倒已有七八家了，全國首產之區是如此：何怪別地？</p>
<p>據北平益世報四月三日的紀載，本年首三月，新設的商店雖有二百五十八家，但收歇的商店也有一百五十三家之多，竟占新設的百分之六十左右。</p>
<p>又據大美晚報一月二十五日載，山西太原，去年一年內關門的商店有五百零八家，其資本原計共約三十七萬馀元，但結果大家都虧折八成之多，到了本年春節之後，據三月十七日的福建民報所載，該地又有一百八十馀家繼之倒閉。</p>
<p>再看漢口，據市政府報告，去年全市大商店八千馀家中。虧折的在半數之上，而歇業的達九百家之多。據南晶的真實報五月一日的紀載，九江的八百馀家商店中。虧本的有二百六十馀家，近五年內共關掉五百六十二家；平均每年要關掉一百十家。</p>
<p>至於汕頭潮州一帶，近年內倒閉的商家達二百七十馀家。而本年即舉行號荘倒閉的。即有二十馀家。（十月十三日中華日報）</p>
<p>總而言之，到處沒有好塲面，這是什滬原故呢？誰者不會說：這是國內市塲繁榮的特征嗎！</p>
<p>但是當新進口稅則公佈不久，上海某報有晚風先生的我國貿易政策的途向大文（九月二十七日某報社平），提倡實施貿易統制應有原則之一，是吸納外國製造品及生產品的輸入，對於農產品及消耗品則禁止或限制其輸入，正確的代言了減輕某種進口稅的真義之有統制性的偉大，可是大衆無能為力來領情，這又有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>我們知道，合理的產業政策，第一個原則，就應有有效而可能的條件。其實任何企圖祇唱高調總是不行的，在開拓國外市塲的高調之下，犧牲國內市塲，這簡直是笑話。既是笑話，我們本不必論他。只為笑話竟已成為事實，這就非同等閒了。不過威信所在，自不能期望政令朝頒夕改，我惟一希望，便只望這未知數早些計算出來。</p>
<p>任何國家，國內市塲是大國產業的其本發祥地，基本策源地，等於軍隊賣的大本營。大本營不事戒防，而只想去向人偷營擾榮，沒有不歸無葬身之地的，何況出口稅的修之，也這說不上有獎助土產口去作愉營龔擊的作用。何況我們在長年入趨之下，在產為被舶來品的侵銷已至於日喜，窮的最後階段，還有什麼光彩去高唱開發國外市塲呢？如果我們賣在進口貨方面稍稍加以限制，那末我國有四百二十七萬八千馀方里的面積。假定每英方里得以各消國貨一百元，則每年國內市塲中即可增加四萬二千七百馀萬元的國貨貿易。換句話說，即可減少這麼許多的入口貨了。假定依我國今日的人口四萬七千四百七十八萬人計算，如果每人每年能多購國貨一元，即以講買洋貨的一元以改購國貨，則每年國貨貿易即可增加四萬七千四百馀萬元。這個增加的數字，就已經與近年我國的入超額數相近了。目前國民經濟力破產，大衆購買力衰退，原是貿易市塲廉條的根本原因。但是如果國家產業能比較發達起來，這也可相因而略為提高。雖則其中依然含蘊蓄著危機，但是要期望克服這種內在的矛盾，在目前似乎有點做夢吧？因為這未知數將更渺茫了</p>
<h3>論農業倉庫與農村經濟</h3>
<p>— 吳曉晨</p>
<p>近來對於國內農村經濟枯竭，資金編集都市，沒有出路，移轉頭來，救濟農村經濟的呼聲，遂甚器塵上，農業倉庫，不期亦應運而生。經當局的提倡，銀行界的資助，風起雲湧，如怒潮之不可復遏。不過在農村極度襄落的今日，能否因農業倉庫的推廣而展開新局面，及農業倉庫是否足以挽救農村經濟的危殆，則實有討論的價值；而農業創庫的沿革，且先作簡略的敘述：</p>
<p>倉庫的制度，在德，美，日三國。破見盛行。我國古時，亦曾推行社倉，義倉等，但均以農民自動積儲食糧為主。牠的宗旨，是以地方自足經濟，為原則。在從前商品交換勢力不大，不特一縣農產比較司以自給，而每家農產，如有馀額，自然可以積儲起來，以防荒年；不論以付，以族，以鄉為單位，祇要在同一的經濟立塲中，即可創立倉儲。可是現在的情形，已截然不同，資本主義的侵襲，商品的狂流，早已把以家，以村，甚至以縣，以省為單位的地方自足經濟，打破無馀。地方經濟既破壞，以地方經濟為原則的社倉，或義倉，自然隨之崩潰。今之農業倉庫，說是可以流動農業金融，輔助農作業復興，同時銀行浮資亦得貸放之機會，其性質與古時農倉完全不同。施行於我國歷史尚淺，民國二十二年五月，行政院農村復興委員會第一次大會時，首先議決農民銀行須在各縣設立農業倉庫。而實業部農業金融討論會，亦擬妥倉法草案，由行政院轉送立法院審核後，即令行各省市主管機關切實遵辦。該部二十二度之農業行政計劃綱要首條，亦為籌辦農業倉庫。不久該部復令飭中央農業推廣委員會，會同寗屬農業救濟協會，舉辦中央模範倉庫。而江蘇農民銀行，經營倉庫業務最早，始創於民國十八年，至二十一度報告已成立之倉庫，計三十三所，房屋八百馀間，堆積米毅容量二十萬石，儲押放欵六十七萬三千馀元。山車省府二十二度七八九月農政計劃二十四縣。湖北省府亦規定與有志投資農村之銀行，先試辦武，陽，襄三縣倉庫。他如中國銀行在山西，陜西，山東，河北，江蘇，浙江獨資舉人辦倉庫，而尤屬目於浙江；該行曾決定以一千萬救濟折省農村，初步即在浙江的吳興。硤石。紹興。馀姚。慈豁。鄞縣。溫州。永嘉。桐盧。建德等處，成立物產倉庫，以最低的利息，抵押現金與農民，以謀浙省農作業的復興。上海商業儲蓄銀行除在江陰之青暘，蘇州之唯亭，江寗之湖熟三處設之倉庫外，復和吳興之潘店，平湖之清溪，宜興之享安，南京之湯山等合作社，以及公共團體主辦之倉庫，或由該行貸欵，或和該行合作辦理倉庫業務。最近該行更與中國銀行合組湖南農產倉庫貸欵團，所以農業倉庫的發達，是當局倡這於前，銀行界推廣於後，在最近的將來，或將有更偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>農業倉庫的歷史，雖尚短淺，而其發達的現象，確有蓬勃一時之氣概。不過我們很可從這短淺的歷程中，去觀察農業倉庫對農村經濟所生的關係及其能力，覺得非特農業倉庫足以挽救農村破產的主張是疑問，簡直是不可能。無農業倉庫的性質，是典當棧嶄的變相。在中國，無疑的，典當是有深長歷史而又異常發達的一種官應特許營業，牠的使命，是在調節貧民金融，較大的鄉鎮及縣城，均有典當的設立，他們對於農作物的典質，另設有棧號，這是大家所知道的。然而在事實上，典當的棧號，非惟不能防止農村經濟的崩潰的危機，到今日更覺得豊著而已！典當棧號的設立，固非始自今日，牠對於調劑農村金融的歷史，遠在農村崩潰未顯著以前，而農村破產的病象，依然是一天深似一天，典當的棧號，一籌莫展，尚且無法挽救；即使欲挽救、亦為事理所不能。反在農村極度凋敝的今日，社會人士，頗主張推廣農業倉庫，足以復興農村，豈非太離開事實。農村的瀕於破產，另有形成的大原因。農業倉庫的規模，雖大於棧號；農業倉庫的取息，雖低於棧號，而牠們的立塲，則同以農民的農產物作保證，而貸現金與農民。農村裹因農產物抵押所得而增加的流動現金，認為可以復興農村，這全是拋開農村破產病源的皮相之談。農民藉自己所有物抵押現金，而運用於農事，誠能如是，則農村不必破產；農民個個有自己的甚至他人的農產可抵，則農村亦示嘗破產？今日所鬧的農村破產，是農民整個的資產破產，並不是農村裹缺少收受農產物的雙方，至農民坐擁農產物而得不到現金的流動。我們從事實上證明，典當棧號營業越發達，農村衰落的程度亦更深刻。蓋典當棧號最擁擠的時期，是在陰歷的年底，農民在那個時候，農事已告一段落，而在農作開始時所張難的資本，在此時期內均須結束，於是迫不得已的，祇有將項備作為明年秋收以前的糧食，拿去典質；所以農民抵押農產所得的現金，量償還抵押以前已欠的積欵，並不是一經抵押，可以多一筆現金來源來運用於其他生產事業上，這是最要明白的。農民的經濟是不斷的在寅吃卯糧中盤旋著，例如春耕開始的時候，農民沒有能力下種，不得不向各處借債，已經預將秋天的收成作為償還春天所欠的保證品。高利貸的風行，就是利用這一個弱點。所以在事實上農民需要資金，是在農作物收穫以前，棧號和農業倉庫對農村現金的供給，則在農作物收穫以後，二者的性質完全是背道而馳的，農民那裹能夠領受倉庫的利益呢？棧號所收受的農產物，既是農民不可或缺的食糧，般貧苦的農民，甚至拿預就的種毅去典質的也很多，蓋農民的缺欵，既在農作物收穫以前，農作物一經收穫，除留開若干糧食外，即須夥去，清還借債；往往尚恐不足，所以在冬間仍要去典質。典質的數目越大，這家農民的經濟能力越困難，也就是寅吃卯糧的程度越深；所以典當棧號營業越發達，農民的貧苦亦日甚，農村的衰條也更尖銳化，這不是好的現象啊！然則典當棧號和農業倉庫，對農民的經濟流動上，並無絲毫輔助，已是鐵一般的事實：不過對農民留存的糧食，在價格的變動上，有損當的保障而已！蓋農民在冬聞缺乏現金，不將僅存的糧食出售，而去典質，就是要防止農產物價的升騰。因為在已往的經歷上，知道上冬的米價，比次年新米登塲以前要賤得多，這是商業高利貸本每利用農民的質乏而操縱所致。如去冬米價每石在五元左右，不道今歲早荒以後，竟漲到十一元多，和去年相差達一倍以上。農民那惠不怕抑價的損失，何況去典持的，正是備作次年的糧食，所以情愿耗去有限的利息，對糧食價格的抬高，有了相當的防止，這是農民典質的本意。新近中國上海二銀行在湖南合組農業倉庫貸欵的章程第六條，曾規定［押欵農戶，因倉庫所獲利益在十元以上者，（以入倉日之市價及售出之價格計算，贖回食用者不在此限。）應以其三分之一，存入銀粵，儲蓄備荒，非遇災荒或特殊大故，不得提取。一用意甚善，可是事實告訴我們，農民正因價格的變動而出抵農產物，他們的期望，也祇在維持目前的環境，尚目力竭聲嘶，經此限制之後，則此農業倉庫對農民經濟所發生的關係，更覺單調。吐種計劃能否成功，也無須敘述，目待事實的證明吧，棧號本來是典當較有把握的營業，自農業倉庫推行以後，典當因取息較倉庫為品，至固有營業，突受侵奪，將來或在淘汰之列。總之：農業倉庫祇可視為銀行界一種穩妥的農產抵押放欵則可，於真正的農村金融，未嘗救濟，更這裹可以復興農村。用置樣的措施，說是為補救農村經濟著想，真是舍星宿海而去探黃河的源，無怪農村破產的病癥，反一步深似一步了。因此農業倉庫的推廣，不過是銀行浮資增加出路的機會，也就是典當棧號末落的開始。銀行界的推行，仍是為著自身利益而合乎潮流的一種手腕吧！豈是真正溝通都市和農堯村金融的方法呢？</p>

<h3>從比蘭台羅說到文學上的悲觀主義</h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>本年的諾貝爾文學獎給與了意大利的戲劇家並小說家比蘭臺羅，想必大家都知道了。關於這個作家，敬之先生曾在本刋上作了簡單扼要的介紹，並特別說明了他是怎樣一個悲觀色彩濃厚的作家。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅的悲觀厭世是作為他的一種哲學，而橫在他的戲劇他作的根抵上的。他認為人生根本是苦海，是虛無。在某一個人看來是真實的東西，在另外一個人看來往往是虛假的，在他笑的時候，另外一個人卻在哭。人生就是這樣，而比蘭臺羅卻沒有給予解決。他以為祇有兩個辦法：死或是裝死，要不然就沉溺在幻想裹面。比蘭臺羅的許多喜劇雖把笑顯示給觀衆看，但那種笑和函默都是以絕望的人生做背景，是齊來苦惱的“humorism”是苦笑。</p>
<p>比蘭台羅的作品正是大戰直後社會的絕望昏闔的精神狀態的反映。雖則一方面意大利的未來主義者們正在［追求樂觀主義］，馬利　利曾宣言過：［對於懷疑悲觀的決定論，我們要用創造的直觀，自由的靈感和人為的樂觀主義來對置。不過，所謂［人為的樂觀主義］云者，不也正是對於可悲的現實之強顏為笑嗎？</p>
<p>悲觀主義浸透了近代的文學，這是周知的事實。這悲觀在比蘭臺羅並不是新奇的。從十九世紀以來，歐洲的文學就幾乎不斷地和悲觀主義聯結在一起。文學的基本主題就是關於社會存在不安定的個人悲觀的意識。莫泊三和柴霍夫的作品就渲染了悲觀陰鬰的色調。哈提的命運觀厭世觀在他的作品裹表現得最透澈。對人生悲觀絕望以至於［恐怖和瘋狂］的安特列夫曾任讀書界風靡過一時。</p>
<p>文學中的這種悲觀主義，由於現社會的空前的不安和混亂，而日益深化，以至達到自己否定的地步。一方面是從叔本華式的悲觀進到尼采的［強權哲學］，用上面所說的［人為樂觀主義］的美麗外衣來掩飾現實的破爛的本質。另一方面是少數忠實的作家從懷疑，苦惱，深思的極致達到了對於可以給予文學以歡樂愉快的性質的那真正健全的社會的認識。紀德便是最近的例子。</p>
<p>要把悲觀主義的錆黴從文學中澈底掃清，祇有在真正健全的社會纔可能。健全的文學將用樂觀的，科學的觀點去解決世界文學中一切悲劇的問題。死的問題在過去文學中是不知引起過多少哀悼悲觀的感歏，對於人生的懷疑絕望的。死自然是死者的不幸，生者的深刻悲哀的來源。但是在健全的文學中，連死也並不是那麼可悲觀的。吉爾波丁說得好：［奮鬥中的死－在促進全人類幸福的事業中的有理智的死－在新文學中已經成了人生的確定的象徵，想要完成人生的最善的組織化的努力的增多的象徵。］</p>
<p>我們需要的就是這種健全的樂觀主義的文學。我們不需要比蘭臺羅的悲觀主義。</p>
<h3>旅途（續）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>地方上的情形，和從前沒有不同啊。</p>
<p>不，不同的地方是有的，我的眼睛告訴我了，它說你看：那大大的院落，為什麼只有很少的人生在裹面，為什麼院牆傾斜，房屋坍塌沒有人修理，！！你明白這是什麼道理麼？你沒有看見荒著的田地沒有人種麼？！！你不明白這種道理麼？不是有幾個村鎮，從前熱熱鬧鬧的，有好多大小舖商麼？現在一家都沒有了，這是什麼緣故呢？………</p>
<p>正在這時，乘客中姓王的說出的話語，打斷了這一幕，我只好放下一頭，聽他們的話。他說：</p>
<p>［老板，住哪個店？］</p>
<p>老板就是車夫。</p>
<p>［還有哪個店，一共只有兩家，還是住張大嫂那罷。］</p>
<p>［張大嫂那裹近來乾凈些了。］</p>
<p>［張大嫂店照顧周到一點。］</p>
<p>那腰存一百多塊錢的人搭了一句。</p>
<p>張大嫂？不錯，想起來了，不經他們說，我真忘記了這個女店主。三四年前從這條路上走著時，我作過她好幾回的店客。那時，因為她很髒，店裹也不清潔，人們都呌他一張大髒，一這名字使我現在又想起來。她是一個寡婦，三十多歲，也許這就是車夫們在從前不忌骯髒仍然去留宿的一個主因。那時店裹的買賣，著實不錯。</p>
<p>她最受人歡迎的，就是放浪不拘的談吐，店客深一口淺一句說她笑話，她從來沒有惱過。她事實上成了公衆的大嫂，人們一見她都是呼喚張大嫂的。</p>
<p>在我的面前，攙著張大嫂一副身像：中等身材，一身航髒的藍布衣裳。頭上亂蓬蓬的，雖然頭頂有一個髵子，也不能扎住。兩只大眼睛，又圓又活，在粉臉中流轉。只有她的粉險是清潔的，只有她的眼睛是勾人的。</p>
<p>她能夠把店裹收拾乾凈些，我聽姓張的這麼說，跟著起了個小小的歡心，那麼這該是張大嫂店政改善的一點了。張大嫂這人真直得佩服，快到地方罷，看看這一別三四年沒有見過的張大嫂罷，我要求見她的急迫情形，甚於車馬的奔馳。</p>
<p>不知為什麼，我禁不住這樣問了車夫一句：</p>
<p>［張大嫂現在還是一個人麼？］</p>
<p>［四個人了。］</p>
<p>［是她走了道，還是招進來的？］</p>
<p>［沒有走道，也沒有招進來，是她的兒子娶了媳婦，媳婦又養了一個兒子，－－這不是四個人麼？］</p>
<p>［啊，是這樣的，那麼她不還有一個姑娘麼？］</p>
<p>我記起她家裹的人。</p>
<p>［前年跟人家跑了。］</p>
<p>兒子娶了媳婦，姑娘跟了男人，張大嫂可算是完了作媽的義務，一個寡婦，獨掌門庭，開店，在鄉村中是多麼少有！但是這種能斡的女性，我也確實聽到一般人對她的誹謗。時代前的社會中原是免除不掉這種現象的。</p>
<p>到得店裹，已經九點多鐘了。這小鎮，可是沒有從前熱鬧了，街兩旁沒有幾家掌燈的人家，商舖也不知都開到什麼地方去。有半段街的房子都坍毀了，車夫告訴我這是胡子燒的。</p>
<p>車房子原先是一連脊十間，如今縮小為五間了，可是，這仍然像是很曠的，因為店客太少了，一共不過十個人。</p>
<p>我想起車夫說的話，想起張大婦的女兒；一個鄉村姑娘，敢和別人私奔，不能不說是時代變更到她的身上。於是，在車上時眼睛問我的問題，我由此全找到了解答。</p>
<p>當女主人走進屋招呼我們這一些人時，使人吃驚的她簡直不是當年的張大嫂了，三個字足夠形容她：她老了。然而這只是三四年的時光啊。如果不是車夫跟他說笑，我真不相信她就是我曾經一度有機會作女婿的岳母。說起來這也是我容易想起她，想起她姑娘的來歷的一種道理的。</p>
<p>七年前，我們家裹往省城搬，晚上宿到她的店裹，我那時十七歲，在中學念書，她跟母親說因為看我將來能成人，情願把她的姑娘許我作媳婦，一切嫁裝都不要，可是讓母親回絕了。我記得好的姑娘比我小一歲，怪有趣的。第二天上路時，母親把這話對車上人說，人人都為這事情嘆息，（我呢？！！我那時根本就沒有想這回事。）母親拒絕的理由，因為她是開店的，她本身已然就有些壞聲名，犯不上因她損失家裹的門風。</p>
<p>這位女店主卻不認得我，當我在晚飯後把舊事和她提起時，她過細的想了一想，有點不騰今昔之感。不過當我問她對於姑娘取怎樣的態度時，她那滿不在乎近於樂觀的情形，又非常使我吃驚，她說：</p>
<p>［年頭是一年一年變，你能怪年青人不玩新花樣麼，跑了，嫁了還不是一樣事情。］</p>
<p>後來她告訴我營業年年低落，客人逐年減少，她所以把另外五間房子租出去，為的多收點房錢，她說生活實在難以維持。</p>
<p>我看她前額上，有些條條皺紋，一條皺紋就是她的一件涇歷，是她為生活掙扎的烙印。</p>
<p>［可欽佩的女人。］</p>
<p>但是她在社會上是受人卑視的。</p>
<p>她走後，我躺下了，打算在這個小店內，重溫我三四年前的舊夢，不行，一直到第二天清早，舊夢還是沒有返回我的睡眠中來。（完）</p>
<h3>賊猫</h3>
<p>— 堀田昇一作高明譯</p>
<p>我和平日一樣，從一早便坐在桌前，文章一行也沒有能寫，只是心煩意亂地抽著煙卷兒。</p>
<p>這時候，一隻小貓，迷了路，走進家裹來了。那是一隻毛頭美麗的三色貓；乃是賊貓的兒子。小貓咕嚕咕嚕地響著喉頭，小心翼翼地提防著四周。我之看見這廝，這時已非第一次了。就是以前，我也曾想用什麼方法把這廝活捉來；卻總被牠逃走了。今天可一定要……！！我一邊小心地伸出手去招牠，響著舌頭，一邊想著：［有什麼好法子沒有呢？］</p>
<p>隨後我乘牠一個不留神，冷不防地站起身來，喊了一聲［噯！］，迸地把紙門關上了。那小貓本來也想像閃電一般改變身子逃跑的：可是終於被關在四疊半（註）的屋子裹了。因為忿怒和恐怖，牠把渾身的手竪起，像猛獸似地閃耀著小的眼睛！！看了這個，即使小得幾乎可以載在掌上的小貓，也簡直令人想起了老虎。否，牠無論怎樣地小，總是兇猛的野獸。牠對一邊招手一邊走近牠去的我發著啀聲，露出這就要咬上來的神勢，并且卒地鑽進了書箱背後的小的鎼縫裹。我這才放心了幾分，心想：一不久便可以弄慣的！一并且到廚房裹弄了一盆子灑上鏗魚乾屑的飯來，放在書箱邊。</p>
<p>但是小貓卻儘是不出來；終於天夜了。我看見這樣長久功夫，一點聲音也沒有，有些不放心起來，便把書箱移開，向鎼縫裹窺去；這時小貓仍舊亮著金色的眼睛，發起崕聲來。裹把小盆子推到貓的鼻子跟前去，那知竟挨牠抓了一下。長的爪痕，著瞧著便紅紅地腫了起來，一條血是流出了。我一邊看著這個，一邊獨語［好，好，你這可愛的傢伙！你這可愛的傢伙！］不知怎樣，心裹異常高興。</p>
<p>小貓就像這樣，終於直到第二天早晨，都沒有從書箱背後走出一步。到早晨一看，那飯還是一些吃動的樣子也沒有。</p>
<p>我在晌午模樣，跑到Ｒ處去了；傍晚才回來。心裹一邊很快活地想著：一個人住著的我家裹，現在有一隻小貓。</p>
<p>可是小貓卻不見了。紙門的角落處，是被撕破了兩處；紙門和紙窗上，都帶著不少爪痕。并且牠連一眼也沒有看的盆子裹的飯，是一粒也不剩地被吃乾凈了。</p>
<p>我對這小貓連尾巴都沒有對我搖一搖，最後把盆子的東西通通吃光了之後逃了去這事，覺得非常愉快。據說，兩代三代做著野貓賊貓的貓，是絕對不為人所馴服的。</p>
<p>我想你一定可以明白我特為把這種瑣事告訴你的意思吧？賊貓的這種利害的地方，是完全中了我意。那還是前天的事情呀！（給Ａ，Ｋ）</p>
<p>（註）在日本，是用［疊］來計算室之大小的。一疊是３乘６方尺。</p>

<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>［哎！！］他長長喘口氣。［良心在盅子裹。在盅子裹！哈哈……］</p>
<p>兩個人毫無緣由的哄笑著。熱淚像小溪，沿住那多毛的臉頰，涓涓流着。</p>
<p>［良心！那是……嘖，看見過嗎？］</p>
<p>他的頭看去不是生在頸項上，反而是木椿上放著一塊巖石。他醉了。</p>
<p>［沒人看到過，］他用拳搥擊著尚且敞朗的胸膛。［良心。那是的，誰都有……喝呀……嗡，若不離忘了：我是個大壞蛋，你知道。不瞞你，我是個騙子；跑子三十年江湖的人，還有不壞得像大瘠嗎？］</p>
<p>［反正一樣。］</p>
<p>［好，你喝。……酒，真是無價寶，那，不會喝［輩子也不知道人的未兒。哈哈……］</p>
<p>頭向後仰起，朦朧月光從天窗射下，撒在他青灰的臉上，淚的水條閃燿。兩眼圓睜。霎間，那多毛而濕潤，筋骨崚崢的臉，絕不含有傷感的意味；已不是一個衰醜卑怯的老人，亦不是喪心的騙客，反而是偉大的，彷彿他正走入彩色的夕陽下。人生最燦爛煌的一葉覆蓋著他，像一個宗教的殉難者。</p>
<p>［給你說，］他重新低下頭去，抹弄著歪鼻，［三十年，三十年的撞騙，怎樣過來的？這！手拍著酒壺肚子，［都是這。沒有牠敢想嗎？］</p>
<p>纔著眉，又滿飲了一杯。要嘔吐的樣子，肩膀往上了湧了湧。在髵邊搔著，以異常衰老的聲調呻吟道：</p>
<p>［哎，我是壞人，壞人……］</p>
<p>顯然，他完全為酒戰敗了。臉被帽沿遮住，鬍子打著灰土色的結，很難見到光彩。他底頭常常歪在一傍，胸脯搧動如一架風箱，像一個被割斷喉管的人，忽然，他立起來清醒的說：</p>
<p>［人！算了罷。誰生來就是騙子？我賣香莩，哪個不賣？可不是都在賣！……那是，香莩不能治病……］</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一張中國的菜單</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>前些時因為中國學生失業問題的嚴重，學生職業運動同盟的產生，一時引起社會人士感歏說：中國教育破產。吳稚暉先生出而解釋，謂不要只是羨慕別人吃魚翅海參席，中國目前的經濟情形，僅可辦出［八大碗。］可是究竟我們吃的是甚麼樣的［八大碗，］則不甚了了，一直到最近的發表，才得到一張［中國的菜單。］</p>
<p>報載教育部最近統計，我國每萬人口中各級學校學生數，與世界各國（合我國共二十四）之比較，大學美國第一（七三人），我國倒數冠軍（一人；）中學德國第一（五二五人，）除土耳其（八人）外，我國亦為殿軍（一一人；）初級加拿大第一（二零八人，）我國又背榜（二三六人。）若以人數多寡計，我國［高等］第十八，［初級］第二十四（最末）云。</p>
<p>這樣在在均落人之後的情形，如果還能強自寬心的認為是［八大碗］的席面時，那這［八大碗］任如何不是出客的饌餚，祇能說是青菜蘿荀的蔬菜。不過蔬菜也不要緊，究竟總可［營養，］可歏的是中國竟自胃口不佳，連青菜蘿荀都不能消化，是以又鬧著學生失業的問題了。這一病態的現象，自然暴露了這一軀體的不健康，因之一些［聖手們就出而主方，大加醫治。</p>
<p>人們說，一方面應縮飲食，一方面則投以滋補劑，增強消化力。前者的方法是用考選甄別來限制過多的飲食，後者則主張［生產，］以求食物改良，免得盒而不化。可是這些藥劑吃下的結果，卻只能掩蓋［消化不良］的現象於一時，卻未挽回這軀體的衰弱，雖說能將［八大碗］辦得［精美］，竟不曾有補於這陷入沉苛的病體。</p>
<p>因此我們不應當諱病忌醫，也不應頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳，彌補的政策不但能醫好病癥，反而使其程度加深。顯然［消化不良］的病象雖屬嚴重，但非中國衰弱的根本病癥，假若中國的根本病癥醫好，病象自然漸次消滅。中國的根本病癥是甚麼。卽幾十年來抑制了中國發展之帝國主義侵略下的殖民地經濟。</p>
<h3>談迎合心理</h3>
<p>— 研時</p>
<p>要［迎合心理］，是多麼類難的一件事，因為［人心乏不同如其面］，然而能夠洞悉各人個性，來迎合他，那末你處處必然［一帆風順］，［無往而不利］，要是不然，便事事棘手，處處碰壁。</p>
<p>譬如：做教員的，要洞悉各個學生的心理，然後施以各個樣的訓管，不然非惟收效甚少，也許要鬧出風潮來，把你的飯碗敲碎。</p>
<p>講到商業方面，那尤其是重要了，怎樣使得顧客的心理，歡喜來買你的東西怎樣才得把這筆交易成功，例如：知道上海人的心理，喜歡裝璜的，你須把貨品裝璜得［金玉其外］，而裹面呢！儘管［敗索其中］也無妨。</p>
<p>再如對於家庭方面講起來，怎樣駕馭你的老婆　，也得研究一下老婆的心理，假如她的性情是喜動的，你得忙裹抽閒的陪她出去看看電影，或者遊山玩水：假如是喜靜的，你得設法投其所好，然後方能享到快樂的家庭幸福；要不然，三日三小吵。五日一大吵，必遭沒趣呢！</p>
<p>以上所舉的幾個［迎命心理］的例子，不過是犖犖大者，恕我，不能詳舉，然而立足於現在的社會，要處處［迎合心理］，才得有飯吃，唉！不禁使我感想到做人的難哩！</p>

<h3>讀書和藝術學徒</h3>
<p>— 石靜波</p>
<p>一個藝術學徒，讀書必須是生活中的一個重要部分。不讀書，要想成功一個藝術作家，那是萬分的不可能。</p>
<p>我們試舉幾個例來看看。</p>
<p>所有的偉大作家，如歌德，托爾斯太，杜介納夫這些人，生活在富貴的階級，受過極充豊的優良教育，這些人的讀書，自然是極其豊富的。</p>
<p>就是從窮苦階級出身的高爾基，只要看看他的［我的幼年］和［我的大學］這兩本著作，我們就可以了然於他之所以成功一個最偉大的藝術作家，讀書是有如何重要的決定關係。</p>
<p>但這裹並不是丟開了他那極端豊富的實際生活，反而讀書是他實際生活中的一個重要部分。</p>
<p>照高爾其自己的回憶，那個嚴厲的教師，那個船上的廚師父，那個退職的衛隊排長，那個舉動粗魯，讀書頗多，打擊與和愛兼用，最初指導他，強迫他讀書的史默利，使他真切的感覺到書籍的重要，漸漸兒也喜歡讀書。</p>
<p>無疑的，在那時，高爾基是作為一個藝術學徒，在史默利的影響之下，開始和書籍發生了極其親密的關係；這關係，一直保存到現在。</p>
<p>其次，如法國的有名作家莫泊三，在他做藝術學徒的時候，他的教師福羅貝爾，限制他五百字一篇文章，嚴格的改來改去。</p>
<p>就是已經成功的作家，據我們所知道的，如妥司拖也夫司基，柴霍夫這些人，他們的讀書學記。也皆是毫不停留的努力著，手記　子一天一天的堆集起來。</p>
<p>在我國的現在，一個藝術學徒的讀書問題，和上列諸人比較起來，的確是高爾基更來的親近點。不只親近點，而且是值得追蹤的典型意義吧。</p>
<p>一個有志於藝術寫作的人，因循於現存的帝國主義系統的那是絕對不成功。反而帝國主義是藝術的最兇惡的敵人。在我國，和帝國主義一樣兇惡的敵人，是封建的殘馀勢力。這勢力，在帝國主義的指揮之下，更其直接的殘暴的毀滅著我國的藝術生命。</p>
<p>事實上，凡是有志於藝術的寫作的人，或前或後，都會捲入了我國當前的大時代的動亂中。因此，一個藝術學徒的讀書問題，就成為更嚴重，更急迫，更繁難了。</p>
<p>不只要讀書，而且要細心讀書，每天讀書。讀書對於一個藝術學徒，正如同吃飯一樣需要。</p>
<p>多讀書對於一個藝術作家，的確是必要的。但是對於一個初學寫作的藝術學徒，那就不是一個真確的道路了。多讀書反而不如選定幾種最有價值的著作，深刻的閱讀，探究，為更有效果。</p>
<p>一個藝術學徒，對於最有價值的著作：首先要了解其中事件的開展情形；其次要觀察其中的人物，談話，行動和其發生的環境等等；再其次要探究其中的藝術的表現意義和描寫手法；最後要用幾種著作來比較；甚至藝衝學徒可以使用其中的材料的經過自己的習作，對照一下作者是何的成功了的，而自己是應該如何的努力，向著成功的道路。</p>
<p>讀書對於一個藝術學徒，［可以加深他的教養，擴大他的眼界，充實生活經騐，增廣語彙等等。］</p>
<h3>我的供狀</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>現在我知道自己是一個蹉跎時日的將成沒有希望的殘馀者了。每每痛心於的拖延下去。就無異送自己走上滅落的邊沿。因是想重新好好的振作一番。縱使這輩子不能去做出一種常人以上的驚動一時的大宗事件但至少也得做到不虧負這份生命的存在。我並非缺力盡責於人生的心和思念，只是安放在腦袋中，想做的願望總歸是願望而已。老是推托著，日子還長哪，今日的事移在明日再說，明日的事又寄給後日，時間滑得很快，所有的事一天天的堆壘著，增高著，終於到了超過能以上而無法整理了。願望永遠是願望，這其間就不知遷延過多少歲月了。於是對於人向的信念更加淡薄，減少。而一方面懶散的惡習性卻逐漸的深固起來。</p>
<p>回頭的時候是常有的，然而十分惚促。有時如同一個懺悔的聖徒，站在教主的殿前，默默地懺悔我生的罪過和狂妄，悄悄地打心裹邊竪了一個新的期求，希望從今而後能夠洗滌我過去生活的污漬。可是當暼到壓在我背脊上生的無形的塵埃。厚厚的無數層，以及羅列在眼底的繽紛的人事。那緩緩地將燃燒起來的熱情，又不禁突然的降落下去，仍然回復到冷冰冰的一窩水。感於人生的白雲蒼狗，感於自己力量的不夠，於是我又一度頹唐了。</p>
<p>不止頹唐，另外還被一種幻滅的情緒的捉住。這幻滅是有著比頹唐更有力的把我的願心我的期求加以無情的毀擊。幻滅更像一片無邊的黑暗雲，遮蔽了青色的天空似的遮蔽了我整個的思想，整個的理想中的光影。於是我有如蹣跚於漫漫的黑茫茫的冬之長夜裹，永不見黎明的長夜裹。瞧不到一顆星星，一點光亮。而那無邊的暗雲似的幻滅不但沒有散放的時辰，且漸漸地加濃著，在我的腦際上，眼睛上，於是幾乎完全沒了願心，沒了期求，更提不起一絲兒對於生的興緻來了。</p>
<p>偶然雲塊被風吹開，稍微吹開了腦際上暗雲似的幻滅。使我陰沉的感覺朗亮了一下，可是不多久，風已停止，暗雲又稠集上來，暗雲似的幻滅又張開它的灰色的翅膀飛撲著。於是我的視覺亦隨著灰色，灰色的份量掩蓋到高過於我的眼睛時，就連一切都無從瞧見了。</p>
<p>這結果，是使我愈加把握住個一定的信心，感情像一匹野馬在時時刻刻的亂奔竄巖。一分鏡會對於什麼東西感到非常親切，而什麼東西所映上我的腦裹的面相亦同樣美麗；但是說不定便在一分鐘後，又截然不同了，也許就會感到什麼東西都可憎，可惡。什麼東西的面相都是醜穢。就連自己也加以痛恨了。於是我幾乎失去平常人的理性作用，所有的事事物物再也不能引起我一點同情或悵觸。我承認自己不二是個生的零馀者，活著跟死沒有兩樣，並且是個生的負罪者，因為沒曾做完一個人應該做的事，想做不能做，又做不來。反而過著一個人不應該過的孽障的生活。然而我已決意不解脫罪惡的十字架，也不想人來替我解脫。讓我一直的掮著，到了那最後的一天，罪狀也就完了……</p>
<h3>新鮮的刺激</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>抽著一支發達爾蹩出了花格門，紫色的黃昏支配著這衖堂，一縷青煙打自己的有著雨前味的嘴唇邊冉冉上陞。沉靜的空氣裹，連自己的皮鞋腳也不敢扔得重，這種纖微的道德觀念常給掛在意識上的。把橡皮頭貼在嘴角邊，鼻孔裹哼著漁光曲用guitar彈奏的過門，虛心地。踱到衖堂口。</p>
<p>五路電車，光白的額角，掛著藍寶石的耳環子掠過去啦。拖車裹擠著戴著烏帽的，戴瓜皮帽的，髪髻裹發著臭味的男女的腦袋，從窗口裹不時扔下一睦煙捲的火星子，跟著鐵輪邊的旋風繞個圈兒便消失了。黃包車總是在電軌上拉著，靈敏的坐客老扔著踏腳板，［豬羅，你性命不要了嗎！］大聲地吆喝著，不知他究竟為了誰的性命著急？要是他自己不坐在車上，卽使黃包車和車夫被撞倒了亦不在他的心上吧？</p>
<p>夜的都市的怪眼，紅色的，綠色的。白色的回光燈反射在那支大腿上，。紳土的惡笑，brandy的流質灑滿一地，廣告美術師的傑作哪，會把這世紀末的年輕人的心從苦悶中鉤引出來，浸潤於新鮮的刺激中。</p>
<p>可是，自己仍被茫然的意識所圍困著，呆站在衖堂口。在家裹本預備去找朋友談天的。可想不出到誰家裹去，近點的朋友幾乎每晚兒都混在一塊，從酒店到浴堂，從俱樂部到咖啡館的那幾條馬路，是熟識得連那一家舖子新進一個夥計卻會在第一天知道的。烈性酒精，農咖啡，蓮蓬浴和裂帛似的歌喉，都有點膩了呢，從前所認為新鮮的刺激，現在可厭惡得和收音機裹的廣告報告，雨天的泥漿路一樣。［到那裹去呢？］……</p>
<p>遠點的朋友嗎？去了或許會呌他們驚奇的。一個夜游神似的孤獨者，沒綠由地去衝破了人家蜜味的家庭的晚敘，是要受到賢淑的主婦們的背後的咒咀的。親戚家裹嗎？呵！那更使不得，我怕長輩們嚴肅的禮教的眼，一個極平凡動作都要受到監視和據束，在那裹我將完全失去動止的自由。我為什麼要走出來呢？家裹不是有著雨前茶的清香，sot的柔適，線裝書裹的逸味和母親額上的慈痕，這些俗惡淫風的畫牌及得上那客室裹，湖山煙雨的潑墨嗎？邊踱著舖滿水果和小食攤的街沿，邊在心兒裹想著。懊喪的神情。發達爾第三根煙蒂兒扔掉的時候，這種反復的思慮亦扔掉了。</p>
<p>在世紀末的所謂新鮮的刺激，除掉色情和淫慾的享受外，再沒有別的什麼了。</p>
<p>就在角子上的紙煙店前點著子第四支發達爾。</p>
<p>回到家裹的時候，有一隻文旦和一袋粟子，我愛文旦的酸澀和粟子的焦香。新鮮的刺激嗎，這就是的吧，從烈性刺激品堆裹擠出來的孤獨者，就這麼在發達爾的淡味，雨前的清甘，文旦的酸澀，粟子的焦香裹守著這一半在瘋狂而一半已死去了的都市的夜。</p>
<h3>日暮</h3>
<p>— 惠士</p>
<p>集著幾個朋友的茶話會，興盡散後，我獨自消聲匿跡的徘徊草木凋凌的秋野裹。</p>
<p>血輸似的夕陽，慢慢地沉下去了，夜之魔開始把她的黑幕靜靜地籠罩著大地，我預備在模糊中回來了。幸而不多一會，皎潔的月兒，從東天一偶徘徊上來。－適才徬徨欲歸的心，卻不禁留戀著那水一般的月色。</p>
<p>春花果然嬌媚可愛，而秋有月之冷爽明潔，也何嘗不令人傾心愛慕呢？看啦！月光之下，萬籟悄然，寂然，好像浸在愛光裹得無上的安慰似的，在那兒臥著，死一般的臥著。</p>
<p>四顧茫然，只見遠遠的小河，映著月光，寃似一條晶瑩的銀帶，從隱約的，渺茫不可知的地方而去，正是人的生命一般，來去的地方委實玄妙。終於懷疑著默默而已。</p>
<p>而我想到是神秘得難解答的問題，愈蘊蓄著絕對的真理。萬物之生也死也，也不過被［神秘］兩字所支配罷了。我頓時覺著自己是正在神秘的懷中徜徉著。－心下悵然，惘然，不自解的心中，慚愧萬分：只是高唱起讚美神秘之歌來。</p>
<p>小河畔的梧桐，被晚風吹動，有一部份的枯葉，已脫離枝頭在不自止的舞著，卻又不容易落到地上，這時我的心啦！正和枯葉一樣，得不到一個著落的地方。</p>
<p>我一面走著，一面深思著，心下又悶悶的好多不可解的問題，都集合攏來，我卽有這樣的聰明為自己去解答。</p>
<p>沉沉之夜，月兒分外流露出她的嫵媚來在開上欣笑。此情此景，憶故鄉，這是人之常情；而我也何嘗能逃出例外。我不由得想到往事，童年時代的生活太甜蜜了。－回想的滋味，使我黯然神傷，心淚漣漣。</p>
<p>那高學府裹的睡鐘聲，噹噹的打破了夜間的沉寂。我恍惚的心靈，聽著那和平的有節拍的聲浪，好像聽到［歸故鄉…歸幫鄉…］的催聲，正在招呼我似的。真的，我也覺得是向著美的故鄉前進呢！</p>
<h3>古城的心</h3>
<p>— 野</p>
<p>蹓躂在古風的石街上，深秋薄暮。</p>
<p>修長的，破碎的石徑響著我的腳聲。祇我一個人，在蒼茫幕色中，聽路傍古樹的蕭蕭，跨著憂鬰的步子，悵惜這晚風中的古城。</p>
<p>悄悄地，倚到一座貞節坊的石柱上，前後飄來了野犬的長吠，</p>
<p>為什麼時光剛跨入夜的門檻，路上便寂無人蹤呢？</p>
<p>下弦月在樹梢後畏葸地窺視，星星卻在天暮上閃著孩子的眼，就藉著這些微的薄光，我用懷古者的心情，瞧剝落的舊家的門牆，衰年的樹木，坍廢的宅舍，不禁微喟著！</p>
<p>衰頹的古城哪！</p>
<p>空氣中也彌漫著衰頹味，挑撥著我的懷古之心情。可是，我想，在時光未睬過這城市的青年期時，它曾做過一塲繁華之夢吧！且從古道，頹牆，衰柳，曲水，或是在居民的悠然神態上，也能體味出它舊日的風韻來。</p>
<p>可是，現在是老了！寥落的人家佔領這並不小的區域。除非路過，誰還肯來這兒瞻觀它古老的面色麼？</p>
<p>爬山虎包裹的城牆已無堞齒，女牆也已臥倒，更樓祇剩幾片斷壁，城門成了蛀虫的家，關不住了。城內，哦，更似一片荒涼的墓地了。</p>
<p>我想，古城有靈，夜夜在哀泣著吧！</p>
<p>野犬的吠聲四面擲來，我倚在貞節坊上，石頭傅給我寒涼的感覺。石柱已顯裂痕，似將倒下，我急急踱開，仍漫步在古風的石街上。</p>
<p>為什麼有這麼多的石牌坊呀！這裹，到處都聳立著，細察石坊上鐫刻的土跡，無非是歌頌忠孝和貞節，原來這古城曾有過不少忠臣孝子和媳婦的，這，也許是它的光榮吧！可是，公正的時光抹去它的光榮，而且站在這些牌坊下的人，不會再生崇敬之情，反而是憐憫與諷笑呢。</p>
<p>我想起了，古城的心，就是那些表揚忠孝貞節的石牌坊吧，在過往，這些石牌坊一定曾閃過驕人的光彩的，但，今年年的風雨，吹打它們灰黯了。</p>
<p>古城的心是死去了！</p>
<h3>理髪</h3>
<p>— 舒城</p>
<p>我每當上理髪店去理髪的時候心緒總是極端地感到不安。這差不多成了神經的通路，尤其是最近，在各種事實上所詔示我，環境不斷地刺激我，不安的成分，更顯得越複雜。</p>
<p>前天，時候是下午三時，我因為沒有選修那門育種學，坐在自修室裹亂翻了幾頁新近出版的ＸＸ雜誌，一點也感不到興趣，望望坐在靠近南面第二個窗子旁邊的淞，他已經站起來了，用右手叉著下巴，向著沙湖對岸山巔上一叢松林發呆！</p>
<p>我走近他的身旁，在他的肩膀上拍了幾拍，才像從洪醉中蘇醒過來，摸著嘴巴上若有若無的幾根鬍子，帶著感傷的表情對我說：［阿城！去剃頭不？］</p>
<p>我點了頭。</p>
<p>一走進了理髪室，我就坐在我最愛坐的那個對著窗子的位子上。這時舊有的每次理髪時所感覺到的不安，重又像電影似的。一幕幕地演映過來！</p>
<p>理髪師在逞著他的技巧，不斷地使用著剪子在不停地剪，我靜默地任他擺佈！</p>
<p>記得做小孩子的時候，一看到理髪師到家里來了，不是破口大罵，便是［溜之大吉！］母親總是說過新年做長袍，買花襪子給我，或者是預先買一個餅子來引誘我，可是理髪時的技術不大高明，又忙著剃，下手很重，感覺有些痛；有時，不等他剃完，我就跑開了！</p>
<p>［哎呀！剃頭還沒有幾天，鬍子又長起來了！人真是不行！］萍像發現了什麼奇跡似的，操著驚訝的語調，推開了理發室的門，站在鏡子前面照面孔。</p>
<p>這些實感，是使我種種不安的原素。</p>
<p>我還有一個感覺，就是每次理髪，總感到離上次理髪時，中間好像只隔幾點鐘的光景，一切的經歷，一點也沒有遺忘。我覺得反省，在理髪的時候，是再好沒有，所以我私心把牠作為反省的時候，這是我近來的直覺，也許是我個人的怪癖！</p>
<p>我一向恨時光是個怪物，一溜就過去，感傷，隨著歲月而增加，如今，理髪後只消四五天的功夫，鬍子就長起來了，那看理髪師就跑的往事，不過在生命史上的一角留著一個淡淡地印影罷了，其他的，還有什麼呢？</p>
<p>我出了理發室，躑躅在由寢室到自修室的路上，我深深地體味到淞，剛才摸著嘴巴，帶著感傷說話的意思。</p>

<h3>給！</h3>
<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>你的境遇我雖然同情，可是你的性格與行為我卻有點討厭。你知道你的青春是過去了，你又知道獻身事業已屬不可能，那你就應該趕快決定你的前途了，可是你卻沉醉在渺渺茫茫的幻想之大海裹頭，我說，你苦悶痛苦是活該。</p>
<p>當你被時代潮流的洪濤捲入旋渦的時代，你自然是認識是一個有著偉大前途的巾幗英雄。你下操，荷槍，衝鋒，陷陣，穿著軍裝的上尉的你，誰不佩服？誰不敬仰？誰不愛慕？誰不追求？可是，當是一個穿著軍裝的上尉的你，卻壯志如虹，不把男人看在眼底，那時自然順嗷，你不是一個女人，而且是一個有著理智勝於情感的性格的男子化的軍人。你能夠在穿軍裝的時候，就是一個男子化的軍人，那末，當你離開軍隊生活以後，你便應該明白你是一個女人，你便應該明白你的環境是將你做一個女人看待，你便應該本色地做一個女人去適應你的環境，去求你的希望，去作你的能夠做到的工作，去度過你的生活。然而，你不。你還以為你是一個男子化了的特殊女人，一個現社會的超人。因此，你在現社會是一個怪物，是一個不合時宜的傻子，是一個不合人眼的女流氓。你以為你是純潔，坦白，有思想有頭腦的時代前驅的女子，你和男人交際就好像男人和男人交際一樣，你和男人來往，發生關係，在你是以為最合理最自然的事；可是，你是失敗了！你是跑在時代前面太遠了，落在你後面的現社會的人們是由駭異而懷疑，由懷疑而輕視，由輕視而欺騙你了。所以，你時常碰壁，上當，失望，受傷，成了一個獨自在沙漠上長征，寂寞，苦悶，煩惱，憂愁，悲哀，痛苦的人。</p>
<p>你以為過去的遭遇付諸一笑便可以了事，其實這樣你便不能夠絲毫得到從過去所獲的經騐的教訓，上當又上當，失望又失望，以後的痛苦還夠你受呢，你怎麼現在還是沉醉在幻想裹頭？</p>
<p>沉醉在幻想裹頭的人是在做夢的人，你以為夢裹總是比較現實生活甜蜜快樂的麼？那是多麼愚蠢的事呵。</p>
<p>我們應該面看現實，和惡劣的環境奮鬬，在人生的路上，正如在赴前綫的戰塲上，赴前綫的戰塲上走著人，容許你沉醉在幻想裹頭麼？不，一不留心，性命交關，只準你用眼睛向前瞭望，用耳朶向左右探聽，用手腳向地上摸索前進，！在人生的路上正是應該和在赴前綫的戰塲走著一樣。</p>
<p>你還以為自己能夠原涼人，人也能夠原諒你麼？你是錯了，絕對的錯。在這生存競爭的社會裹，人們的本領有的是虛偽，奸詐，在外表上看來都是正人君人，而在骨子裹都是自私自利的人。你以為只有男子是自私自利的人了麼？女人呢？女人在都會裹環境也迫她自私自利了，這你應該認識清楚。現社會是在製造自私自利的人，也就只有自私自利的人才能夠生存於現社會。你不顧自己的幸福，你努力所得的結果，只是一個傻子的實惠吧了。</p>

<p>開篇　紅樓小宴</p>
<p>黛玉不減舊豊姿。漸漸精神復舊時。金質不加鬆質髪羅衣寬褪瘦腰肢。那實玉暗先窺覺。便婉轉音聲勸慰之。當此圖屏秋色好。藥燼煙裹鬥新詩。你看這。紗窗形天然圖。銀燭秋光絕妙詞。倘是你故故撫床常獨臥。怕不被。嫦娥窺見笑人癡。迎春姊妹妍然笑。說道行樂人生須及時。命紫娼即刻排小宴。衆姊妹排坐不歉辭。禾桿香送金樽滿。落紙揮毫不費思。寶玉卻受金樽罰。早已白面泛胭脂。憑欄桿試望天邊月。缺陷全無大好時。寒露遠遠過花枝。</p>

<p>號燈一起計來行。圍困垓心十萬兵。火箭噴筒齊放下。柑枝著處火星星。霎時火勢燎原野。一片紅光耀眼睛。到底火神來駕幸。人人害怕人人驚。一時間毫無序秩紛紛亂。自相殘殺不分明。人騎馬。馬踏人。尸積遍地鬼神驚。弟兄散。父子分。分離骨肉更傷心。祇聽得一片哭聲音。猶比那。熱鍋螞蟻無藏躱。猶比那。沒頭沒腦衆蒼蠅。火起處。煙霧騰騰。著身軀。臭不可聞。猶比那薰田鷄。猶比那炙死人。前無去路後無門。諸葛亮奇計安排巧。只燒得焦頭爛額夏候惇。出茅盧第一得功動。</p>

<h3>美國的女子們仰望着嘉寳的理由（中）</h3>
<p>— 細流</p>
<p>無疑的，嘉寳最大的誘惑，是根據於她的夢寐的羅曼斯，而不是現實的羅曼斯。所以她在這一點上，她和別的電影女演員就有迥然不同的地方。她們儘管去模倣她，但她還是不可比擬的別具一格。很奇怪的，她的個性特殊使人無從模擬的地方，並不在她的臉上，而在她的身上，那種具有成年男子風味的身段，以及行路搖擺的態度，是一般女子們所學不像的。她沒有閨閣的氣息。她沒有那種嬌那無力，小鳥依人，楚楚可憐的樣子。她所代表的是一種魄力，遇事不茍之精神。這種魄力，這種精神，就是嘉寳成名的要素。也許這就是茂立斯史鐵爾見到的地方，他將她從低微，默默無聞的地位，提㧞了起來，造成世界聞名的一位大明星。這位具有超人的魔力的大導演，知道美國正在缺少著一位新型的女性，去代替拖著髪捲，帶著酒渦，嬌羞作態的小姑娘們。他知道美國的女子們，已經有了解放的印象，正需要著一個特殊的女性，可以做她們的領袖的。所以等到他將嘉寳掮了出來，大家就一致推服了。</p>
<p>嘉寳的出現於銀幕，卻在一個適逢其會的當兒。她差不多十年之久，永遠統治著一般女性。她發起了披肩的長髪，她創造了許多衣服帽子的式樣。她提倡了女子的方闊的肩，使女兒們都一個一個裝扮得像足球健將一樣。她亦指點了一般女性，怎樣的穿著男子的裝束，嘉寳她自己不在銀幕上的時候，是喜歡穿男袴，絨衫，平底鞋，寬袖等等，現在都已風行一時了。可是她亦沒有故意的去創造式樣，使人效法。她不過衣著她最所喜歡的，最適合於她的體格和脾胃的，不期然而然地被一般女子們所效法罷了。她們崇拜她，而要學得和她一樣，就是僅僅在外表上亦好。她是她們解放的表率。她們欽慕她的獨立性，她們羨慕她的魄力。她是時代前的女子。</p>
<p>嘉寳在她所拍的影片中無論在那一幕，她總控制著一個中心地位。這種顯然的優越地位，是一切女子們所欽羨的。不過這種特殊的地位，亦可以說是她幼小時候孤苦伶仃的境遇，無意之中所遺留下來的孤僻性所造成的。這亦或者就是她永不求愛或結婚的理由。據一位有名心理思想專家的所說，為什麼一個女子喜歡穿著長袴，而不著女子的長裙？那就是她們喜歡在外表上顯示她們內心對於優越地位的需求。這位專家，阿特爾教授，他說這種女子都賦有一種男性的倔強－也有受其累的，也有受其惠的。他也驚奇地看見女子穿袴的人數增加。明白世界上許多女子，都恨不得他身為男兒。這個理想，在許多美國學校裹的測騐方面，已經證實了美國女學生之中，大約有百分之四十，是願意身為男兒的。這種倔強性，是女子們對於設想上女子的劣等地位的一種反抗的表示。這種設想，從幼小的時候，就深深種入她們的腦中，當她們看見父親們總是較比優越的，過著不同的驚駭的，可愛的生活，為男了的種種利益，已在女子的心靈上，起了種種深刻的變化，使女子對於自己的職位，起了一種普遍的不滿。女子們所受的教育，是教她們要能博能博得男子們的愛，呌男子們對於她們覺得好看。但是倔強的女子，非但反對取媚於男了，並且想自己做男了。這就是長袴男裝等等的出發點了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評［熱血丹心］</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Yorck－上海</p>
<p>這一部烏發公司在希特勒政府指導之下的德國影片。也是一部所謂歷史影片。</p>
<p>一頁過去了的歷史，決不會偶然的搬上銀幕，必然的或多或少的反映劇作者的見解與主張，何況是將其作為宣傅工具的時候。因此，遠在一八一二年的歷史片斷，任希特勒的納粹主義之下，便因著能夠適合現在的政治情勢從墳墓中掘發出來了。</p>
<p>約克（Yorck）這十九世紀的普魯士的英雄，到二十世紀的三十年代，他是假借著希特勒而復活了。可不是麼？在那時候，他不遵守普法盟約而和拿破崙時代的法國作戰，而現在　字徽號的梟雄卻要廢除大戰後協約國對認德國的一切條約，而從新成為一個有方的侵略國家。當然，在第二次大戰的前夜，歐洲覊權的爭奪，沒　雖然有著小協國的臣伏在并擁國聯以作護身符，可是她仍然是德國最大的敵人。當然，從軍縮會議或爭奪薩爾鑛區等各方面，我們都可看出希特勒的企圖。而在國內宣傅上，所謂恢復民族的自由，便成為最好的詞句了。但是我們卻要問，在　字黨的政權之下，真有所恢復自由嗎？別的我們且不說，德國許多自由主義的電影作家如柏布斯脫之流，便不能停留於本國的領土而被放逐出去，那末，所謂自由在什麼地方呢？難道說少數人的自由便是所謂民族的自由嗎？</p>
<p>再說罷，所謂民族自由是怎樣解釋的？原來他們所求的是擴張軍備，以保障他們在第二次大戰中取得勝利。那末我們相信，德國大多數人民，並不需要侵略戰爭，他們所要求的是改變現在的經濟組織，和全世界的民衆，共同獲得政治上，經濟上真正的自由。</p>
<p>如上所述，［熱血丹心］的劇作者的宣傅說教的企圖，其歪曲到何等程度，乃是毋容解釋的了。卽就製片技巧來說，我們幾乎不能相信這是曾經光耀於往日的烏發的出品。一部以戰爭為背景的影片，我們簡直很少看過沉悶到如此地步的。在戰塲上我們固然祇能寂寞的聽著單調的號聲，而在威廉第三的宮庭中，也是沉悶到這般程度的。</p>
<p>在這一影片中，最大的成就，便是飾約克的演技的沉重而已。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>［健美運動］我見</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>嚴格地說一句，這是一張故事不完整而拚湊功的影片，它的成績只在［人間仙子］之下。無疑的，這暴露了電影的商品化。</p>
<p>丟開現實不談，我們且先將內容的茲點來說一說吧：</p>
<p>劇作者在這裹，祇抓取了一些紀錄式的題材，他用三個絕對不同的時代來代表故事的展開。但很顯然的，劇作者沒有充份理解到每一個時代的真實情形，他祇寫著一些浮面的社會現象。</p>
<p>於是，我們在銀幕上但看到人和自然的鬥爭，女性強健的體格，及用威力來克服男性，人類生活的樸實等；這就是所請［原始時代］。李後主的玩纖腰，弄小腳，將女性視為男子玩物，儘量壓迫女子，那就是［封建時代］。現社會所謂一般摩登女性的甘供資產階級的男子們玩弄，和過度的頹廢生活，破壞健康，這種提示雖針對了時下一般女性的病徵，然而終不能掩飾其誇張的弱點，那就是［資本主義時代］。我以為這種膚淺的單純的見解，實在是錯誤的。</p>
<p>不過，如果劇作者將這些題材作更進一步的採取，那末末始不是一個很好的對象，可惜他沒有做到。尤其是他在提倡婦女體育之下，並且還有教育的企圖，但因技巧的不純熟而結果反致弄巧成拙了。</p>
<p>導演者在本片的過失，也不能不負起相當責任的：一原始時代的幾個塲面是在外國獸片里剪接下來的。二內中以東南體師遊藝會來作［健美運動］的大部份，似乎也不應該的。三原始時代不該有燙髪的郎，這也是導演者對於現實的忽略。</p>
<p>演員方面，在游泳的幾幕都呌黎梨梨來代替了英茵，英茵早操時的動作也是那麼機械式的。以一個自身不合健美條件的來提倡［健美運動］，事實上已覺可笑，況且［健美運動］的意義，決不是示在觀衆面前就算了事的。其他所謂二百馀少女者，也不足取。</p>
<p>鏡頭角度的美麗，這是但杜字的擅長，我們在他每一個作品裹面都可見到他這些小聰明的。</p>

<h3>黑面慈心（Imitation　of　Life）（一）</h3>
<p>— 文印</p>
<p>美國環球公司出品　克勞黛考爾白主演</p>
<p>裴德麗絲正在忙得不亦樂呼。今天好像日子不好，所以一切都異乎尋常的不湊巧。她正在給他的孩子洗著澡，電話亦響起來了，咖啡亦燒焦了，她已經過了辦事鐘點二十幾分鐘了。但是那頑皮的吉茜，還是將身軀東扭西歪，一　嘴說道：［我不要到那個看兒所去。我要跟媽媽在家裹玩。］裴德麗絲歏了一口氣，哄著她道：［我亦情願跟你在家裹玩。但是我不能不出去，那怎麼好呢？］確實的，一切都不容易，自從她丈夫去世之後。她要出去調理她丈夫的生意　零零碎碎的東西，維持母女兩口子的生命。但是這種日子，真不容易。天天要出去，一家一家的挨著兜賣糖油。人家拒絕的時候，你祇好裝著笑臉走開。有的時候，她想到了前途的茫茫，她卻不得不鼓著勇氣向前走。歲月如流，這種辛苦已經在裴的秀麗的臉上，畫上了幾條綫紋，在她的芳心上，添了些黑暗的影子。但是她總是自己鼓勵著她自己，認定了一切都是值得的，有意義的。祇要聽見了她孩子笑聲，一切的犧牲，一切的痛苦，都可以一筆勾銷了。這時她想起了，她就低下頭去，在她孩子粉紅色的香噴噴的頸上吻了一下。那個孩子被她一吻，肉癢著往下直鑽，差不多要從她懷裹跌下去了。裴連忙喊道：［寶貝，不要動，我給你穿衣服！］電話的鈴又響起來了。裴歏了一口氣，無可奈何地將一半穿著衣服的孩子放了下來，呌她坐在凳子上不要動。自己就奔下樓去接電話去了。</p>
<p>她奔到樓下，可巧那不是電話響，是門外有人掀門鈴。她就去開門去。她從窗紗裹看見外面站著一個又胖又大的黑婦人，一個大臉光亮得像磨光的烏木一樣。裴開了門，問她什麼事。那個黑婦人的眼睛帶著懇求的神氣說道：［你早晨好。我的名字呌蒂里拉。你不是登廣告要用一個黑女傭嗎？我是來找事的……］裴聽了，有些莫名其妙起來，她不覺問道：［你說的是什麼主廣告？］那黑婦人於是從口袋抽出一張，從報上剪下來的分類廣告。她說：［這就是……上面說…徵求一個女傭…要能燒，能洗，能管家，最好黑人，不怕勞苦…工錢不大……］裴聽了，連連搖著頭道：［你弄錯了。我沒有登什麼廣告。］蒂里拉再拿那張廣告看了一看，然後問道：［這不是亞斯德路嗎？］裴於是恍然大悟起來，原來她差了路了。她說道：［你弄差了。這是亞斯德街。亞斯德路離這裹還很遠，在那一頭哩。］她指著門外道，［你可以在這條街拐彎的地方走了電車去。］蒂里拉道：［我祇好走了去了。］她說著就想走。裴看了她怪可憐的，就說道！［走路是太遠了…你等一等，我去拿幾個錢，給你坐車去。］蒂里拉聽了，不覺感激萬分地說道：［你太仁慈了。］她說著，又四面嗅著道：［什麼東西燒焦了？］裴給她一句話提醒了，連忙奔到廚房裹，那裹咖啡已經燒沸了好久了…一鍋麥皮粥亦燒枯了。但是她還沒有能將粥移開，樓上的孩子，已經哭喊起來。裴不顧三七二十一，連忙奔上樓去。她半天已經將吉茜忘記了。等到她走上去一看，那個孩子已是濕淋淋地坐在浴缸裹。她因為要去撈一隻玩具小鴨子，跌了下去，嚇得她大哭起來。（未完）</p>

<h3>Shi Liangcai Murder Case Unsolved; Chiang Kai-shek Sternly Orders Solution Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Otherwise, Responsible Authorities at All Levels Will Inevitably be Severely Punished Without Leniency]</p>
<p>Hangzhou Military Police Search for Several Days, Detaining Many Suspects</p>
<p>Zhejiang Authorities Punish Personnel Responsible for Negligence in the Shi Liangcai Case</p>
<p>Nanchang: Upon reading newspaper reports that Shi Liangcai was shot and killed in Zhejiang, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was extremely angered and telegraphed Governor Lu of Zhejiang Province to strictly investigate. Lu also presented a brief report on the incident. Chiang telegraphed Lu again on the 18th, stating, "This case occurred in Zhejiang Province and is truly shocking. Yesterday, I telegraphed ordering a strict investigation. I hope you will supervise the military police, cooperate with neighboring areas, offer rewards for capture, and solve the case within a time limit. Otherwise, responsible authorities at all levels will inevitably be severely punished without leniency." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Hangzhou: The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that the location of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road tragedy was in Haiyan County. The police chief of the responsible public security bureau outpost disregarded defense, and Wu Chengyou, the head of Bo'ai Township, was unaware that bandits were waiting along the road for three or four days, which was a dereliction of duty. Each should be given a major demerit. Xu Yan, the head of the county public security bureau, failed to prevent this major case and failed to make arrests afterward. In addition to receiving a major demerit, he will be temporarily retained in his post with orders to make arrests. If the case is not solved within a month, he will be dismissed and punished. County Magistrate Jiang Huiyue also cannot escape blame and will be given a minor demerit with leniency, with a ten-day deadline to solve the case. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Suspect Tang Yunsheng in the Shi Liangcai murder case is still difficult to release because several points still need to be investigated. However, according to the person in charge of the public security bureau, Tang is not the main culprit in the Shi case, nor is he a good person. Furthermore, as a result of several days of major searches by military police, it is reported that more than ten additional suspects have been detained. However, whether they are related to the Shi case is still being strictly investigated. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Telegraphed Replies to Various Party Departments and Groups</h3>
<p>Nanchang: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in response to the congratulations from various party departments and local mass organizations on the recovery of Ruijin, telegraphed replies on the 18th, saying, "To the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, the Shanghai Special Party Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Security Office Special Party Department, the Hankou Special City Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, the Tianjin Special City Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, the Nanyang 40th Army Special Party Department Executive Committee, the Hankou Wuhan Garrison Brigade Special Party Department Preparatory Committee, the Xiaguan Naval Special Party Department Executive Committee, the 29th Army Special Party Department Preparatory Committee, the 7th Division Special Party Department, the Military Police Special Party Department, the Luoyang Military Branch School Special Party Department Preparatory Committee, and Comrades from All Circles in Kaifeng, Henan, your telegrams have been received. Killing bandits and defending the people is the duty of soldiers. Although the pseudo-capital has been recovered, the remaining bandits still need to be eliminated. I am deeply grateful for your telegrams of condolences, which have been forwarded to the pursuing and suppressing soldiers at the front to encourage them further." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>Peiping: Zeng Kuangqing, at the invitation of Liu Xiang, flew to Hankou this morning to accompany Liu to Nanchang to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, separately reporting on the current situation of anti-banditry and military and political training in North China. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Organizes a Naval Escort Team During the Winter Defense Period</h3>
<p>Hangzhou: Ma Junchan, Chief of Staff of the Hangzhou Garrison Command, said that during this winter defense period, the security on land in various counties will be handled by military police and security groups. The security of the sea is extremely important. Currently, there are about 40 merchant ships traveling to and from the coast. It has been decided that the provincial security office will lend a large number of guns and ammunition to organize an escort team to prevent pirates and ensure the safety of travelers. Ling Xiao, captain of the water police brigade, has been ordered to be responsible for planning and implementation. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony for the Memorial Tower of the 88th Division Martyrs</h3>
<p>Hangzhou: The foundation stone laying ceremony for the Memorial Tower of the Martyrs of the 88th Division in the Battle of Shanghai was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 18th. The tower is located between the Fourth and Fifth Parks on the shore of West Lake. A ceremony platform was set up in front of the tower this morning, with solemn and serious arrangements. Although it rained that day, guests from all walks of life, including Zeng Jianying, and more than a thousand police officers and vehicles attended. Yu Jishi, the former commander of the division, presided over the ceremony. After performing the ritual, he led everyone in a moment of silence to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the division. Yu then reported on the construction and significance of the tower, stating that the 88th Division had more than 600 officers and more than 1,600 soldiers killed in action in the Battle of Shanghai, totaling more than 2,200 people, most of whom were brave young men from Zhejiang. Therefore, it is specially built here to leave a lasting memory and to encourage those who survive to avenge their deaths. His words were extremely mournful. Next, Ma Junyan, the director of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparatory process, stating that the tower was started in August this year and today is the supplementary foundation stone laying ceremony. It is estimated that the construction will cost 36,000 yuan. The provincial government has allocated 5,000 yuan, and the remaining amount is raised by former commander Yu and donations from Shanghai figures such as Du Yuesheng, totaling tens of thousands of yuan. More than 10,000 yuan is still lacking, and it is hoped that all parties will continue to sympathize and donate. The design of the tower was done by Yan Yichu, the architect is Gu Hengjun, and the sculptor is Liu Kaiqu. The project is perfect. Wang Tingyang and Fang Qingru, members of the provincial party department, and Sun Yuanliang, the current commander of the 88th Division, and others gave speeches, which were full of indignation and moving. Finally, Yu Jishi personally laid the foundation stone. After the ceremony, Yu told reporters that the completion and unveiling ceremony of the tower is scheduled for January 28th or February 2nd next year, because February 2nd is the day when most of the soldiers of the division sacrificed for the country.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On Japan's Extraordinary Diet and Finance</h3>
<p>— Shu.</p>
<p>In the preparatory talks for the London Naval Disarmament Conference, the United States clearly intends to maintain the old ratios, or to extend both the Washington and London Treaties. Britain, however, plans to conclude a new treaty, in principle abolishing the two existing treaties. Although this is close to Japan's view, the actual content is incompatible and the technical opinions are vastly different. This situation presents many obstacles to Japan's claim for military equality. This much is obvious without further explanation. Since Japan is vocally advocating military equality, it should have sufficient financial resources. However, in reality, the struggling farmers have no spare capacity to support the expansion of armaments. The Osaka area, the center of industry, has also suffered particularly heavy losses due to wind and flood disasters, and it is difficult to recover on its own. How can it fill the endless desires of the military? The current state of Japanese rural villages and cities is such that there is a demand to convene an extraordinary Diet to jointly devise sound strategies.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has always been wary of the Seiyukai party and feels difficult to deal with them. It is impossible for the government to manipulate a majority of Diet members at any time, and dissolving the Diet and acting arbitrarily is often not permitted by reality. Therefore, the current government has procrastinated repeatedly, and only now has it decided to convene an extraordinary Diet at the end of November. Those who advocate constitutionalism and recognize parliamentary politics as the highest political principle should be delighted and prepare their strength to meet the Diet convened in this extraordinary period. However, Wakatsuki Reijiro, the president of the Minseito party, suddenly announced his resignation amidst the call for this Diet. As a result, the leadership of the Minseito party has become a problem. With Wakatsuki's resignation, the selection of a successor is a matter of much deliberation. The political views within the party cannot be concentrated. How to consolidate the lineup to cope with future political battles, and how to decide on a plan to alleviate the suffering of agriculture and industry, have not been fully studied. Although the problem of choosing a president has temporarily come to an end, with the current Minister of Commerce and Industry, Machida Chuji, serving as chairman of the General Affairs Committee and acting as president, the lack of leadership talent within the party and the ills of party politics have been fully exposed. The Minseito party is like this, but the Seiyukai party, which holds an absolute majority of seats and is in an adversarial position with the current government, also lacks the ability to plot the situation. At most, it is barely able to maintain the status quo and prevent the party affairs from splitting.</p>
<p>In short, parliamentary politics in Japan has long been nominal, not substantive, and cannot bear the true mission or be a representative of public opinion. However, the constitution must still be maintained, and the current system is difficult to change suddenly, so its form must still exist.</p>
<p>The financial budget, which is closely related to the modern parliamentary system, must be supervised by the parliament in Britain. This is the greatest power of the parliament and its most important weapon. However, this is not entirely the case with the Japanese Diet. The members cannot escape the constraints of traditional customs and often accommodate the special military requirements without much dissent. In the past, the Japanese Diet has only been able to make technical criticisms of the government's budget bill, but has not been able to make fundamental revisions. This is the reason why.</p>
<p>The current Minister of Finance, Fujii, is not from a political party, so he is still able to escape the constraints of party politics and advocate his austerity policy. However, Fujii still has to allocate 44% of the total budget expenditure to military expenses. In addition, other expenditures such as political expenses exceed the income by more than 700 million yen. Given the situation, he has never completely overcome the difficulties of the so-called "deficit." The shortfall can only be made up by issuing public bonds. Therefore, Fujii's austerity policy still has the suspicion of being inconsistent with reality. As for the army and navy, even with this huge military budget, they are still not satisfied. They believe that in this extraordinary period, the needs of national defense cannot be judged by ordinary standards. Therefore, the military budget must be based on the original plan of the military department. However, due to the prevalence of natural disasters and the need for relief expenses, they are willing to make slight concessions and voluntarily reduce some of it. However, in any case, the military expenditure in the next fiscal year must still increase by at least 200 million yen. It is inevitable that the total projected expenditure will exceed this year's budget.</p>
<p>In our observation, Japan's finances are truly in a dilemma. If it continues to issue huge amounts of public bonds, even if the financial world has the capacity to bear it, it will further promote the concentration of wealth and cause social inequality. At the same time, the accumulation of national debt to more than one billion yen is by no means a long-term solution. As for increasing taxes and increasing the burden on the people, it goes without saying. The amount of income cannot exceed 100 million yen at most. It is like using a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood. The difficulty of the financial problem is the true difficulty of Japan. Blindly demanding equality in armaments only shows that it is overestimating its own capabilities.</p>
<h3>America Inclined to Reopen the Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Political Problems Should Be Resolved - Maintaining the Status Quo to Ensure Security</p>
<p>High-ranking officials here in Washington are today studying the possibility of convening a conference of Pacific nations, in view of the fact that all Pacific nations are willing to maintain security based on the territorial status quo. Such a conference may be of great success. It is generally believed that such a conference may achieve greater cooperation and more concrete results, unlike European-style conferences where each country acts on its own and makes concessions to each other. Proponents of holding a Pacific conference say that focusing solely on discussing naval issues has left other broader peace issues shelved. Therefore, holding a conference of Pacific nations may lead to agreements on political issues, as was the case with the previous Washington Conference. Currently, officials from the Navy Department and the State Department are still awaiting progress in the London naval talks. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Replies to the British Foreign Office</h3>
<p>Naval Negotiations Enter an Important Stage</p>
<p>Representatives Matsudaira and Yamamoto in London, along with Ambassador Yoshida and others, have been discussing various countermeasures based on the instructions of the Japanese government from the morning to 2 p.m. on the 17th, in order to obtain a perfect plan for the second step of negotiations with Britain. On the other hand, Ambassador Matsudaira dispatched Councilor Kato to the British Foreign Office to inform them of the receipt of the instructions and to express the hope for early consultations. However, since Foreign Minister Simon has not yet arrived at the ministry, it is not convenient to decide on a date for the consultations. It is expected that it can be arranged on the morning of the 19th. From this, it can be seen that the preliminary consultations have entered an important stage. (17th Japan Federation Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo Regarding the preliminary disarmament talks currently being held in London, the Japanese government expects to establish a new agreement based on Japan's proposal, in accordance with the main points of the telegram instructions to Plenipotentiary Matsudaira. However, since the claims between Japan and the United States are completely opposed today, Japan is making all preparations for when its claims are not accepted. Japan's policy is as follows: 1. If the claim for substantial equality of armaments can be recognized, then regardless of the form, it may be issued in the form of a resolution or declaration. If the claim is not accepted, it will be difficult to continue the talks and the fact is equivalent to a breakdown. However, Japan will never give up hope for disarmament, and will abandon the form of breaking off the talks. Following the precedent of the Economic Conference, it will advocate indefinite postponement. 2. The indefinite postponement should be announced by the five countries involved in the Washington and London Treaties, Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, in the form of a joint declaration, stating that they will not give up hope for disarmament and indicating their willingness to continue the talks if necessary. 3. A continuing committee should be formed by the five countries' commissioners to review new methods of disarmament. 4. The five countries should declare in the form of a declaration that they will strictly abide by the two treaties of Washington and London until they expire in 1936 and will not compete in building warships.

<h3>Britain and the United States Will Conclude a Separate Treaty</h3>
<p>Davis Asks Roosevelt for Instructions</p>
<p>If the Washington Treaty is declared abolished, what attitude will the powers take? This has become a current issue. Japan's reply has proved that it is unwilling to change the position it adopted at the beginning of the negotiations, and the attitude of the United States is also quite firm and will not make concessions. Therefore, the future of the naval negotiations is very pessimistic. According to a Washington dispatch in this morning's Times, U.S. Chief Representative Davis has submitted to President Roosevelt the conditions agreed upon by Britain and the United States. If an agreement cannot be reached between Britain, the United States, and Japan, then Britain and the United States should conclude a treaty between the two countries based on these conditions. It has recently been claimed by official sources that if the Times dispatch refers to Davis's suggestion from the British side to put forward conditions agreed upon by Britain and the United States, then this statement is absolutely inaccurate. However, it is possible that Davis contacted President Roosevelt regarding his own opinions without first consulting with the British representatives. If so, then the dispatch in the Times should have a reason. In short, Japan's tough attitude has made the situation of the naval negotiations quite chaotic. Whether Britain can accept in principle the method of the United States and the United States separately concluding a treaty, creating a joint front between Britain and the United States against Japan, is doubtful. However, another method, that is, the powers separately concluding open bilateral treaties, so as not to give the impression of confronting Japan, may be considered. Britain, in any case, must strive to avoid confrontation with Japan. Although it is not possible to predict whether this method of separately concluding treaties will be successful, at present, many people in the political world still maintain the impression that Britain should maintain its attitude of sympathy towards Japan, so that Japan believes that Britain will not try to obstruct Japan's naval development. Otherwise, the relationship between the two former allies will inevitably become tense. From this, it can be seen that there are currently two trends: one is to sympathize with the United States, one is to sympathize with Japan, one is to seek cooperation between Britain and the United States, and one is to seek cooperation between Britain and Japan. Britain's attitude is wavering between the two. It is possible that neither of these two trends will be able to achieve complete victory, and Britain will devise a compromise based on Japan's reply. It is generally believed that once Britain and Japan have consulted again and the Japanese representatives have presented the Tokyo government's reply, Britain will immediately negotiate with the U.S. representatives. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London In recent naval negotiations, due to Japan's tough attitude, it has reached a stalemate. The theory of Anglo-American cooperation has become very popular. The Sunday Times recently published an article saying, "We can imagine establishing a North Atlantic Treaty to maintain the maritime code of humanity, and then gradually promote it to the major oceans. If this ocean treaty is successful, then the hope for future peace and security can be based on this. Compared with the numerical reduction of armaments, its effectiveness is more significant. Not only that, with this ocean treaty to enhance the power of peace, we can almost obtain the cooperation of the United States. South African former Prime Minister Smuts said in a recent speech that British foreign policy should be based on Anglo-American cooperation. Smuts's claim can be realized here. It should be known that this new United States only has infinite power and political ideas that are close to us." (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington People here believe that the London naval talks have very little hope of success, because the United States has decided not to make any concessions to Japan's demand for naval equality. What measures should be taken when the Washington Treaty is declared abolished has already been considered. People are very interested in the suggestions of U.S. Chief Representative Davis. This suggestion advocates that Britain, the United States, France, and Italy should first conclude a naval treaty, and in the future, if Japan abandons its demand for naval equality, it can join the treaty separately.

<h3>El Salvador Rejects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Tokyo According to information received by the Pottery Export Association, in order to adjust the one-sided trade with Japan, El Salvador has imposed a 20% tax on Japanese goods since September. As a result, Japanese exports to El Salvador have been temporarily blocked. Thereupon, Germany took the opportunity to enter the country, reducing prices by 20-30%. If this continues, Japanese goods may be completely expelled, which is very worrying. Moreover, British goods have recovered the South African market, American goods have invaded Cuba, Colombia, and South America, and German goods have invaded the above-mentioned areas. The examples are the same, and Japanese goods have been greatly hit as a result. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying promising new markets. To counter the measures taken by various countries to reject cheap Japanese goods in order to adjust the trade balance and promote Japanese exports, it has decided to conclude new treaties with these countries and strive to secure markets.

<h3>Austrian Chancellor Meets Mussolini</h3>
<p>Long Talk Lasts Two Hours</p>
<p>Rome The eyes of Central Europeans are now focused on Rome again, because Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg arrived in the Italian capital yesterday and will hold several talks in accordance with the Italo-Hungarian-Austrian protocol signed in May. Today, Schuschnigg met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for two hours, but it is expected that there will be no new developments in the relationship between Italy and Austria. The Italian newspaper today published an article by Gaeta, who is a permanent representative of Italian political views, stating that these meetings were stipulated in the tripartite protocol, in order to develop the principles followed by the active cooperation between the two countries. The Austrian Chancellor laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier this morning, and went to Ostia for a tour in the afternoon. This afternoon, Ciano, the Undersecretary of the Italian Ministry of Information and Propaganda, hosted a banquet for Austrian journalists who came to Rome to investigate the talks between the two prime ministers. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome Today, Prime Minister Mussolini hosted a luncheon for Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and delivered a speech, saying, "All of Europe needs to unite and cooperate.

<p>Paris French Congressman and Chairman of the Veterans Association, Gaillard, and Paris City Councilor, Monnier, met with German leader Hitler for a meeting lasting two hours. The words spoken by Hitler to the two men have recently been published by Le Matin, which stated, "There should be no misunderstanding between Germany and France. The current difficulties come from the Saar problem. It is arrogant to say that Germany wants to go to war. After the previous world war, we deeply know the disaster of war is useless, because the best people in both countries are destroyed, and as a result, even the victorious country cannot get any benefits. The best plan for now is to restore a new social order. If Germany and France can reconcile, the nightmare will naturally disappear, the psychological comfort will be obtained, and the economy of the whole of Europe will naturally improve. To realize this ideal, everything depends on the efforts of the two countries. You are both veterans of the past war, and you have witnessed the disaster of war, so you must hope that the world will maintain peace." (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Basic Concepts of National Socialism</h3>
<p>Lecture by the Director of German Propaganda</p>
<p>Social Life is More Important Than the Individual</p>
<p>Cologne Today, Dr. Dietrich, Director of the Propaganda Department of the German National Socialist Party, gave a lecture here on "The Basic Concepts of National Socialist Philosophy." About 1,500 people, including professors from Western German universities and representatives from the scientific community, listened to the lecture. In contrast to the previous theory that the most important object of philosophy lies in the individual, Dietrich said that today's trend of life has shifted from the individual to the social community, so intellectual life and philosophy have to move forward with it. Dietrich later said that individualistic thought takes the individual as the premise of life in the world, but the premise of this assumption is now known to be wrong, because life in the world is not one person, but a member of society. Therefore, the situation we are encountering now is not based on several individuals as a unit, but is only for scientific research, but in philosophical thought, the reason why people are important is only because they are a member of society, and the meaning of life lies in this. Therefore, the mission of National Socialist philosophy is to open up new territory in the scientific field in order to seek the growth of social life, so that it is completely consistent with the philosophical understanding. Dietrich continued to discuss the long-standing issue of freedom of scientific research, saying that the National Socialist state absolutely guarantees the freedom of scientific research, but science should fulfill the most basic requirements for every citizen, that is, science should never go beyond the natural limits of social life. Dietrich finally mentioned the issue of religion, saying that the National Socialist movement is fundamentally unrelated to religion and allows the church to maintain its free territory to carry out its religious activities, and has no intention of intruding into its scope. "National Socialism has separated religious forces from politics, and for the same reason, political forces will never invade religious activities." (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Franco-German Trade Relations</h3>
<p>Paris The Franco-German trade agreement was signed on July 28 this year and will expire on December 31 this year. Before December 1, both parties must agree to extend the period of validity or sign a new agreement. However, the current balance of trade between France and Germany has changed. In 1933, German exports to France exceeded 300,000,000 francs, while from August of this year to the present, French exports have exceeded 36,000,000 francs. French exporters should get payment for goods, which must be sorted out. The negotiations between the two parties are now scheduled to begin on Monday. The discussion will be purely on the issue of remittances. As for the quantity of import restrictions, it will depend on the outcome of the discussion, and the previously set amount can also be used unchanged. However, this issue is very complicated. When Minister of Commerce Marchandeau returns to France from Russia, he may need to stay in Berlin to directly negotiate with the German authorities. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Bolivia-Paraguay War: Bolivian Army Loses Fortress</h3>
<p>Thousands of Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>Asuncion The Ministry of the Army here announced today that the Bolivian fortress of Ballivian, which has been besieged for years in the Gran Chaco War, has been occupied by the Paraguayan army. The Bolivian army has retreated, and the Paraguayan army has captured many weapons. Therefore, even if the countries of the world that manufacture munitions impose an arms embargo on Paraguay, Paraguay can still support itself for a long time. The Ballivian fortress has been besieged for more than a year, and there have been thousands of casualties on both sides. The Paraguayan army's offensive this time involved 250,000 soldiers. Although it has won, the number of casualties is also about 6,000. Although the Bolivian army is protected by the fortress, there are also many casualties. The Paraguayan military claimed that the Bolivian army was in great disorder when it withdrew from the fortress, abandoning countless guns and food. This is the fourth time to attack the Ballivian fortress, and the total number of casualties on both sides is about 15,000. The Paraguayan army commander is General Estigarribia. After repeated setbacks, his spirit is still not discouraged. The Paraguayan government has even conscripted young people over the age of 18 into military service to launch a full-scale attack, and finally won the victory. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina Several regiments of Argentinian soldiers have rushed to the border to prevent defeated Bolivian soldiers from fleeing into Argentina.

According to a statement by the Paraguayan army commander, this battle captured 7,000 enemy officers and soldiers, including the enemy chief of staff. The Paraguayan authorities now hope that the Bolivian army's defeat this time can resolve the long-standing Gran Chaco case. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Paris Will Become a Silent City</h3>
<p>Paris Paris will become the "Silent City of Europe." All kinds of modern life's noise-making devices and city sounds will be banned by the Silence Association. The association believes that unnecessary sounds disturb people's work, confuse people's thoughts, and cause France to waste as much as 500 million francs every year. Six-tenths of these sounds can be reduced, especially the sound of vehicles in the street. The association is currently focusing on banning the sound of car horns. The authorities have cooperated with the association to set up "silent zones" in the city. Drivers are warned not to blow their horns indiscriminately. Rules have also been set for train whistles, and they are not allowed to blow indiscriminately unless they are for warning purposes. (18th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Philippines Hit by Another Hurricane</h3>
<p>Manila Yesterday, another hurricane struck the Philippines. This is the fourth time in the last two weeks, and it is also the most severe of the season. A total of more than 250 people have died. On the island of Luzon, where Manila is located, 30 people drowned. On the island of Mauban, more than 200 people were killed.

<h3>Cooperation Between Major American Industries and Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Washington - According to political observers here, major industries, which have resisted the government for two years, are now willing to compromise based on President Roosevelt's terms. The overwhelming national support for the President in the recent election has evidently made most domestic capitalists and industry leaders realize that their efforts and money spent on opposing the President's "New Deal" have been self-defeating. Many left-wing Democrats were elected this time, while conservatives from both parties largely failed. With these new adversaries, major industries prefer to collaborate with the government to cope with the left-wing elements in Congress. Some financiers on Wall Street, with significant investments in various sectors, are said to have presented concrete peace terms to government leaders: if the government helps them fight against radical elements in Congress, they will cease attacking the government. Government authorities are unwilling to accept these terms but have shown a rightward leaning to satisfy the financial community. Consequently, the American Chamber of Commerce has elected prominent industry leaders to form a committee to collaborate with industry, agriculture, and labor sectors to devise a permanent recovery plan to submit to the President. The Chamber of Commerce indicated that this plan is quite progressive in nature, but also opposes inflationary policies advocated by left-wing legislators, etc. Recently, representatives from groups such as the American Bankers Association have been sent to the White House to express their sincerity in cooperation to the President.

<h3>Stratosphere Exploration</h3>
<p>Dr. John Piccard, brother of the scientist Professor Auguste Piccard of the country of Gotha-Lobi, accompanied by someone, traveled 125 miles on October 23rd. Because the balloon was not equipped with a radio, it is unknown where they flew. Fearing a fire in the balloon that would damage the extremely valuable instruments, they jettisoned the instruments, and the two safely descended to the ground by parachute. According to Dr. Piccard, the purpose of this ascent was not to break the 13 and two-thirds-mile altitude record reached by a Soviet balloon, but only to observe the meteorology of the stratosphere. According to an official statement released today by the National Aeronautics Association, the doctor and his wife ascended to 11 miles less 101 feet this time. It is noted that Mrs. Piccard just obtained her balloon license this summer, becoming the first woman to ascend into the stratosphere. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Problem of the Emperor's Advance Guard Taking the Wrong Road</h3>
<p>Maebashi - Police Inspector Shigehira Honda of Gunma Prefecture, who was in charge of leading the Emperor's procession and took the wrong road, committed suicide at home with his sword at 9 AM this morning due to a sense of great responsibility. He was discovered by his family and taken to a local hospital at 5:30 PM, where he has regained some consciousness. However, his condition is still very critical, and he is under close surveillance. (Dentsu Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding the responsibility for misguiding the imperial procession in Kiryu City, now that it has affected Home Minister Goto, and amidst ongoing discussions, Police Inspector Honda, who guided the procession on the 18th, suddenly committed suicide, which has given government officials a great shock and is quite worrisome. This is because the issue of Police Inspector Honda's suicide lies not in legal principles, but in morality. As the case has become so profound, if Home Minister Goto still attends the parliament in his capacity as Home Minister, he will surely become the target of criticism, causing even greater disturbances and even escalating to the questioning of the government's responsibility. Considering the situation above, it is also possible that Home Minister Goto may resign to take responsibility. Therefore, the general public is paying close attention to Home Minister Goto's attitude from now on. (Japan Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Borrows from the US</h3>
<p>25 Million Dollars</p>
<p>New York - The New York Federal Reserve Bank has lent Belgium a sum of $25 million. This measure aims to prevent Belgium from being forced to abandon the gold standard.

Since it takes time for Belgian gold to arrive in the US, the Reserve Bank is providing this loan to meet its urgent need for US dollar exchange. The newspaper also stated that President Roosevelt's lifting of the ban on gold exports is also intended to alleviate the pressure on countries using gold. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>New Trends in German Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Foreign Press Agency, London - The suspension of naval negotiations between Britain, the US, and Japan, the political changes in France, and the instability of the political situation in Central Europe, amid these circumstances where European politicians have no room for other concerns, has created a good opportunity for Hitler's Germany to break free from its isolated state. The initial activity in Britain, with the goal of gaining its goodwill and support, is starting with issues such as the Saar problem, and its participation in negotiations between Britain and France is a noteworthy development. Ribbentrop, a key figure in Hitler's inner circle, ostensibly traveled to Britain for recuperation a few days ago, but secretly met with Foreign Minister Simon. Although he personally denies it, many London newspapers report that he is carrying a mission from Hitler to conduct important negotiations with the British government. The so-called mission is to obtain the British government's understanding and support. Combining various sources of information, its contents seem to be: If the British government agrees to lift the Versailles Treaty's restrictions on Germany's military affairs in the matter of Germany's right to military equality, then Germany will 1. rejoin the League of Nations, 2. participate in general disarmament conferences again, 3. reconsider the Eastern Locarno Treaty, which it had rejected, and 4. pay attention to guaranteeing Austria's independence and agreeing to non-interference in its internal affairs. However, it is also said that in order to gain Britain's support, Germany will propose concessions in other areas, such as trade.</p>

<h3>Judicial Yuan Clarifies Ambiguities in Recognition of Illegitimate Children</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The Judicial Yuan, based on a request from Tianchang County, Anhui Province, to clarify ambiguities in the recognition of illegitimate children, has resolved the matter through a unified interpretation of laws and regulations. 1. A request for recognition of an illegitimate child can only be made to the surviving parent. 2. If an illegitimate child has been raised by the biological father, it is not limited to education and does not require the biological father to have cohabited with the biological mother. As long as there is a fact of raising, it should be considered as recognition. A criminal charge of abandonment of a child and a request for alimony should originally be made after recognition. However, filing a lawsuit for abandonment within the statute of limitations and requesting alimony implies that recognition is a prerequisite, and therefore the right to request recognition cannot be said to be illegal. If the statute of limitations has been exercised, it should be considered interrupted. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Northwest Inspection Notes</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya of this Newspaper.</p>
<p>A Collection of News from Dunhuang</p>
<p>Dunhuang's commerce has always been the leader in trade outside the pass. Goods coming from Suiyuan in the west and products from Xinjiang transported east are mostly traded here. The merchants are primarily from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces, but recently there have been groups from Hebei, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia. The Shanxi group is the oldest and most powerful, followed by the turbaned Hui people, Mongolians, and Tibetans, who busily trade with each other, making for a thriving business. The turbaned people mainly sell cotton, furs, raisins, dried melons, dried apricots, and woolen carpets from southern Xinjiang. There are also many small snack shops and general stores. Inland merchants mainly purchase cotton, opium, leaf tobacco, furs, and other local products, and sell cloth, tea, paper, cigarettes, and daily industrial goods. Wholesale businesses are more common than retail stores, suggesting that the commercial activity is even greater than it appears. Although the turmoil caused by Ma Zhongying in Xinjiang last year, followed by the events in southern Xinjiang, blocked traffic, the flow of goods in and out of the area was not completely cut off. According to a survey conducted by Tang Yuqing of the Dunhuang Special Tax Bureau, the quantity of goods transported from Xinjiang from September 1, 1933, to August 31, 1934, is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Cotton: 3,550 dan (a unit of weight), with each dan weighing 240 jin (a unit of weight), and each 100 jin priced at 20 yuan. 2. Coarse cloth: 180 dan, with each dan containing approximately 300 bolts, and each bolt measuring 1 zhang (a unit of length) and 6 chi (a unit of length) in length and 1 chi and 2 cun (a unit of length) in width, selling for only 4 jiao (a unit of currency). 3. White grapes: 1,000 dan, with each 100 jin priced at 20 yuan. 4. Apricot kernels: 60 dan, with each 100 jin priced at 35 yuan. 5. Dried apricots: 70 dan, with each 100 jin priced at 20 yuan. In addition, there were large quantities of furs and a small amount of Russian goods, but unfortunately, no figures are available. Goods imported into Xinjiang from inland areas were primarily cigarettes, followed by black tea, coarse tobacco leaves, opium, brick tea, qianliang tea (a type of brick tea), cylinder tea, and spiced noodles. Their value was about 60% of the goods coming from Xinjiang, indicating the abundance of products from the new province.</p>
<p>The Seventy-Two Gold Mines are all located in the South Mountains. The closest is Qingshui Gully, 260 li (a unit of distance) from the area, and the furthest is Zake'ertai Gully, 820 li from the area. The gold mines were opened in the 51st year of the Qianlong reign (of the Qing dynasty). There were 2,000 gold miners, each paying a monthly gold tax of 3 fen (a unit of currency) and 3 li (a unit of currency). The mines opened on the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar each year and closed on the ninth day of the ninth month, due to the ice season, which made it impossible to pan for gold. The annual gold tax collected was 396 taels (a unit of weight). Afterwards, the amount gradually decreased. Now, under the promotion of County Magistrate Yang, there are only 40 to 50 gold miners.</p>
<p>Dunhuang's Water Conservancy consists of ten canals. This spring, a Water Conservancy Bureau was established to manage the canal heads and canal chiefs of the ten canals. (There are two canal chiefs in the entire county, ranking above the canal heads.) As for other water conservancy matters, during the three months between the Beginning of Summer and the Beginning of Autumn each year, canal heads engage in malpractices by selling water, farmers cause trouble by stealing water, and powerful households secretly monopolize water, leading to endless disputes and lawsuits, which are difficult to prevent and investigate. The local people are lazy but fond of litigation, their relationships are weak, public reason is unclear, there are no organizations, and they like to exclude outsiders. There are too few solid members of the community, making it difficult to improve county administration. This makes even managing a single water canal difficult.</p>
<p>Education is undeveloped, with only three out of every hundred people being literate. The Mass Education Center has a reading room with three newspapers: Shen Bao, Gansu Republic Daily, and Northwest Daily. Unfortunately, they are not bound. The county gazetteer was first compiled in the eleventh year of the Xianfeng reign (of the Qing dynasty) and has not been revised for over a hundred years. Much of the local history has been lost. A proposal to revise it this year has begun.</p>
<p>Annual Festival Customs: On New Year's Day, families hang colorful lanterns and paste spring couplets in front of their doors. For three days around the Lantern Festival, the Fire God Temple is brightly lit, and a gauze tent is set up in front of the Drum Tower, displaying Buddha statues and lighting turtle-shaped mountain lanterns for men and women to watch. In the third month, on the Qingming Festival, the City God goes out of the city to the Li altar, where operas are performed and sacrifices are offered. Graves are also visited that day. On the eighth day of the fourth month, there is a grand gathering at the Thousand Buddha Caves. Men and women go to offer incense three days in advance, and the day is particularly lively. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Dragon Boat Festival, families insert willow branches and paste Zhong Kui's image in front of their doors. Many married daughters return to their mothers' homes, which is called the Daughters' Festival. On the sixth day of the sixth month, people boil herb leaves to make soup, and men and women bathe in it, which is called the "Throwing Scabies Festival." In the seventh month, on the Zhongyuan Festival, the City God goes out of the city again, operas are performed, and paper is burned to worship ancestors. In the eighth month, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, relatives and friends send each other melons and cakes. Daughters who are engaged visit their future husbands' homes once, which is called the Reunion Festival. On the first day of the tenth month, the City God goes out of the city as before. Women whose husbands died away from home burn paper money and kneel and cry outside their doors, which is called the Soul-Calling Festival. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, families worship the Kitchen God. On New Year's Eve, ancestors are worshiped, and a wooden spoon filled with wine and vinegar is used to throw red-hot stones into each room to ward off evil, which is called "Throwing Vinegar Bombs."</p>
<p>Ordinary women dress simply. Before marriage, they wear braids; after marriage, they comb their hair into a bun. Wedding dresses are rare, and there is little jewelry. They wear cloth clothes and bind their feet, with graceful figures and a beauty that suggests illness. This year, several prostitutes have recently come from Beiping (Beijing), and their fashionable clothes may influence the local simple customs. The women of the turbaned Hui people have natural feet and wear veils, similar to Indian attire. However, their eyes and faces are fairer and cleaner than those of Indian women. They can sing "Sending Off My Brother" songs in Chinese, which are crisp and pleasant to hear. The lyrics are roughly as follows: "I'm sending my brother outside the gate, holding a water pipe in my hand. Two puffs of the pipe, and tears run down my eyes. I'm sending my brother outside the gate, holding hands and not letting go. I ask my brother when he will come back, if not this year, then next year. I'm sending my brother to Yellow Grass Slope, where there are many yellow sheep. A yellow sheep has two horns, but no younger sister to send off her brother." When asked who they are, the singers reply with a humming sound, "Grapes from Turpan, Hami melons. A 'Yanggeye' [term for women] from Kuche - a flower," which is romantic, unrestrained, and uniquely styled.</p>
<h3>Perpetrators of the Tianjin National Hotel Bloodbath Extradited</h3>
<p>Ji Hongchang and Others Transferred to 51st Army Headquarters</p>
<p>Liu Shaonan's Body Remains Unclaimed</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The eleven perpetrators of the National Hotel bloodbath case in the Tianjin French Concession were extradited to the Public Security Bureau of our provincial capital in two batches this morning at 10:30 AM. The French authorities handled this matter with extreme caution and strictness. During the extradition, French detectives escorted the armored prison car both inside and out. Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi were transported in the first batch, and Xu Ayun, Qian Qiupu, Li Hanshan, and other suspects in the second batch. After the prisoners arrived at the Public Security Bureau, they were briefly interrogated by the Third Section. Because Ji Hongchang was injured and unable to speak much, he was immediately sent to the 51st Army, where he will be tried as a political prisoner by the Military Law Office. After Ji and Ren were injured, they were once guaranteed by two businesses and transferred from the French Xikai Hospital to the Japanese Concession Public Hospital for treatment. Ji and Ren were both political prisoners subject to an unrescinded central wanted warrant, and they feared that the French police would extradite them to our side, so they attempted to escape the law by seeking bail for medical treatment. However, Ji and Ren were only in the Public Hospital for one day before being retrieved by the French police. At the same time, our side also sent personnel to request extradition. The French police believed that Ji and the others were plotting wrongdoing within the concession, disrupting the peace and order of the concession, and were quite resentful. They also feared that granting Ji and the others bail this time would set a precedent. Therefore, they decided to allow the extradition. Knowing that things were not going well, Xu and the others confessed that they were running a shell game gambling operation in the National Hotel, which was exposed, resulting in a fight, and that there was no political motive. However, the French police believed that the circumstances were conclusive and did not allow for sophistry, so they still sent the case as a political crime. Before being sent to the authorities, Ji cursed Xu Jiyun for setting a trap to harm people. After arriving at the Public Security Bureau, they were interrogated by the Third Section. Ji was stubborn and abusive. After interrogating them, the bureau followed the orders of the authorities and transferred them to the 51st Army headquarters in the afternoon at 5 PM, where they will be tried by the Military Law Office. Regarding the deceased Liu Shaonan, also known as Liu Qiming, his body is still stored in the French Xikai Hospital and has not been claimed. Some have found out that Liu's original name was Qi and he was from Guizhou. He had a mother, wife, and children in his hometown. After coming to Beiping, he studied at the Law Department of Peking University. During the heyday of the Zhili Clique, Liu was a representative of Guizhou. When Cao Kun was in power, Liu was the director of the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Beiping. He married Xiao Qihui, a woman from the same hometown, and had one son and three daughters, but abandoned them. He then had an affair with a Quan, with whom he lived for a short time, and then fell in love with her cousin, whom he subsequently married, divorcing Xiao. He also severed ties with the Quan family. Last year, Liu returned to the Southwest and obtained the title of Director of a certain office in North China, receiving funds to operate in North China. He returned south this summer and came to Tianjin again at the end of last month, where he was active in the concession, contacting reactionaries and those who were dissatisfied with the current government. Now, after being shot and killed, his body is in the hospital, and his mother, wife, and children in his hometown still do not know that Liu has died tragically. (10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Officer Murdered Wife</h3>
<p>Strangled, Dismembered Body, and Threw It into the Sea</p>
<p>Perpetrator Claims It Was a Sexual Desire Problem</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, in Keelung, Taiwan, a tragic case occurred in which Japanese naval assistant and police officer Tsunetsujiro Yoshimura murdered his wife Miyako, dismembered her body into several pieces, and threw them into the sea, shocking the entire island. Taiwanese newspapers considered it an unprecedented tragedy in Taiwan, especially since it was committed by a current Japanese naval police official, and launched a strong attack. The Governor-General's Office initially ordered all newspapers to delete the name and the name of the agency and the title of the official, replacing them with "囗囗囗." Later, only a pseudonym was allowed to be published, while the name of the agency and the title of the official were still deleted and replaced with "囗囗." Finally, the entire case was revealed, and there was no way to hide it, so complete publication was allowed. The fact that a Japanese official committed such a crime in a colony greatly damaged the face of the empire and its credibility. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Tsunetsujiro Yoshimura, originally a first-class Japanese naval machine engineer (44 years old), later served as a police officer in Penghu. In 1924, he was promoted to police reserve in Kaohsiung Prefecture and also served in Hengchun. In 1928, he resigned and temporarily served as a health inspector in Taipei City. Later, he resumed his position as a police reserve. In 1932, he was transferred to Kaohsiung. His wife, Miyako (42 years old), and eldest son, Katsuyuki (14 years old), were in Kaohsiung. He entered into a temporary liaison with his beloved, Ryoko Shizuka (32 years old). Fearing gossip, in March 1933, he was transferred to the Keelung Haidera Branch Office, where he has been in charge of transportation until now. He lives at 97 Tenjincho in Keelung City. On the night of October 28th, the couple had an argument, and neighbors heard a commotion, which then subsided. The next day, Miyako was not seen, and after about a week of disappearance, there were rumors of a tragic murder and concealment of the body. The Keelung Japanese Police Department sent personnel to investigate the truth and Yoshimura's behavior. They learned that Yoshimura was passionately in love with Shizuka and had been arguing with his wife Miyako since then. There was suspicion that he had killed his wife and destroyed the body after the argument on the 28th, so Yoshimura and Shizuka were arrested and strictly interrogated. Yoshimura confessed that at 9:00 PM on the 28th, after arguing with his wife, he strangled her with a rope around her neck while she was asleep at 9:30 PM. He wrapped her in a bed sheet, bundled her like luggage, and ordered a rickshaw puller named Zheng Ming to transport her to the second floor of the Esaki Trading Company in Yoshiemoncho, where his mistress Shizuka lived, and hid her there. At 3:00 PM on the 29th, he removed the body, dismembered Miyako's body into several pieces with a knife and hacksaw, packed them in kerosene cans, wrapped them in cloth, and tied them with rope, like luggage. At 8:30 PM on the same night, he told the owner of the Esaki Trading Company downstairs that he wanted to move and borrowed a cargo bicycle to transport the kerosene cans from upstairs. He loaded them onto the bicycle and transported them to the Shabasaki coast and threw them into the sea off Keelung to destroy the body. According to his confession, the Keelung Police Department began searching for the body in the sea off Keelung from the 4th, using divers to search the seabed day and night. On the 6th, they finally found the kerosene cave and several pieces of the body, but the head was missing. Dr. Kubo of Taipei Medical College dissected the body and confirmed that the features below the head, including the two limbs and two arms, were undoubtedly the body of the victim, Miyako. Her eldest son, Katsuyuki, was summoned to identify the body. Katsuyuki said, "I don't understand much, but it's true that my mother had one gold tooth." On the 7th, Miyako's head was recovered, further confirming the identification. On the same day, the entire case was transferred from the police department to the prosecutor of the Keelung Court. On the 8th, 9th, and 10th, the prosecutor investigated the case and determined that the cause of the case was that Yoshimura had another mistress, Shizuka, with whom he was passionately in love. His wife, Miyako, often argued with Yoshimura and made trouble for Shizuka. When Shizuka could not bear it, she complained to Yoshimura and demanded that Yoshimura find a solution. Yoshimura's love for Shizuka grew stronger, while his relationship with Miyako became increasingly cold. Miyako often started arguments, which gradually turned into hatred. Shizuka continued to urge him to find a solution, which led to the idea of murder. Yoshimura carried the body to Shizuka's place. Witnesses heard Shizuka say "Okay" after Yoshimura brought a package and they exchanged words. Shizuka was involved in the subsequent dismemberment, transportation, and disposal of the body. Yoshimura confessed to the prosecutor that the motive for killing his wife was very simple because his wife could no longer satisfy his sexual desires, so he had no choice but to seek them from Shizuka, who had exceptional sexual power. He hoped for leniency and a sentence of four or five years of imprisonment. Currently, there are 20 witnesses in the case, and the indictment was filed with the court for trial on the 12th.

<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Unwilling to Purchase Haiyuan Pavilion Collection</h3>
<p>Due to the Large Sum of 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the Books Are Good, They Are Ultimately Not Urgent</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the essence of the Haiyuan Pavilion collection was transported to Tianjin, various parties have been contacting to purchase it. Shen Honglie, the mayor of Qingdao, sent a letter to Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, stating that the books were finely collated, the best edition in the country, and admired both at home and abroad. It would be best if Shandong provided funds to purchase them to prevent them from falling into foreign hands. Today (16th), this reporter interviewed Han and asked for the provincial government's opinion on this matter. According to Han, Mayor Shen did write a letter urging the provincial government to buy the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, which is true. I also know the value of the books very well, and it would be good to obtain them. However, they are ultimately not urgent, and 400,000 yuan is too much. There are many places in this province where construction and education urgently need funds, and it is not easy to save such a large sum of money. (16th)</p>
<h3>Survey of Alum Industry in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Production Accounts for More Than 70% of National Output</p>
<p>Failure Due to Uncertain Mining Rights and Poor Distribution</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: Pingyang's alum mine has the richest reserves in the world. In the country, in addition to Shouyang in Shanxi, Yidu in Shandong, Zhangde in Henan, and Lujiang in Anhui, Pingyang is also the leading producer of alum, accounting for more than 70% of the national total. This has long attracted the attention of mining scholars. The National Defense Committee, the Central Geological Research Institute, and the Zhejiang Mineral Survey Institute have all sent personnel to drill and explore to seek technical improvements. The essence of the mine contains potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate. It is heard that the Construction Department recently published a simplest new method, which can separate potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate into two. The former can be used as fertilizer, and the latter can meet industrial needs. It is very important to use alum to extract potash fertilizer and refined alum to expand alum sales for the future of the alum industry. The original report is explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of the Mining Area: There were originally two alum mining areas in Pingyang. One is Taihu Mountain in the Beigang area, which has been closed for many years. The other is Chishi Mountain (commonly known as Alum Mountain) in the Nangang area, located in the mountains 120 li south of the county. The export is transported 40 li by mountain road to Zaoxi, where it is transferred to river boats to Aojiang, about 50 li, and then transferred to seagoing vessels, which is more convenient. The mining area covers an area of about 11 li long, starting from the south of Beishan Street, passing through Shuiwei Mountain, and ending at Jilong Mountain in the east. According to the Central Research Institute, the ore reserves are estimated to be 180 meters thick, with an average specific gravity of 2.75, yielding more than 2 trillion tons of ore (2,041,875,000 tons). The chemical test results show that the ore contains about 90% alum. Using local methods, 400 jin of ore can extract 100 jin of pure alum, i.e., in a ratio of 8 to 1, it can extract more than 150 trillion tons of alum.</p>
<p>Types of Ore: There are many types of ore with different compositions, so the prices are also different. The ore is classified into seven types: first-grade, tiger-striped, large-flowered, fine-flowered, large-kernel, white-brain, and black-slimy. However, this is purely a classification based on the experience of miners. According to the report of the Central Research Institute, the molecular comparison of alum ore is k20.3 hl20.4 s03ch20, which means that the first type contains 92% alum, and the rest is water, aluminum, 1 oxygen, and 3, which can be regarded as amorphous hydrous aluminum oxide, mixed with hematite and quartz. The second type contains about 80% alum, and the rest is water, sand, 2 oxygen, and 2 aluminum, which can be regarded as kaolin. The third type is a type of alum-altered rhyolite, containing about 41% alum, about 48% quartz, and the rest about 9% kaolin and 1% hematite. The fourth type is alum-altered tuff, locally known as fire flower, containing about 60% alum, about 25% quartz, and the rest 3.5% kaolin and 4% hematite.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Alum Industry: There are currently 18 kilns in operation, mostly composed of two to five people. The operating and distribution method is based on the number of pans burned per person per month. Each kiln requires about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan for capital, including building the kiln and equipment, and more than 6,000 yuan for working capital. The source of capital is mostly borrowed from merchants or money shops, in addition to the kiln owner's own funds of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, so the interest burden is very heavy. However, the division of classes from mountain owners, miners, kiln owners, and refiners is very distinct and unrelated, so it cannot become an organized and systematic industry.</p>
<p>Mining and Refining Methods: Previously, pure manual digging was used. After 1925, explosives were used to open the stone. The refining still uses local methods. The collected ore is arranged on the left and right, and melted in the kiln. After the fire is hot, it is dare to be immersed in water, crushed into a pot, and boiled into a thick liquid, which is poured into the underground pit alum bucket to allow it to crystallize.</p>
<p>Types and Uses: Big Pearl accounts for about 5% of the output, Cuozhu accounts for 40%, Quanzhu accounts for 20%, Tongzhu accounts for 25%, and Lizi accounts for 10%. Big Pearl is the uppermost layer of crystallization, with the purest quality, so it is also known as Qingfan. However, it is difficult to dissolve, so it does not sell as well as foreign alum. Lizi crystallizes at the bottom layer, with silt, so it is also known as Tufan. Currently, each kiln can produce 40 packages of alum per day, about 340,000 packages per year. The average price per package is about 2.5 yuan, and the profit is about 4 jiao after deducting costs. The uses are: 1. Dyeing leather, 2. Paper making, 3. Medicinal, 4. Dye mordant, 5. Replacing tartaric acid for bread fermentation, 6. Waterworks lye pool, 7. Gold plating liquid, 8. Fertilizer, 9. Alloy for military supplies. The sales areas include Shanghai, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Yingkou in China, and are transshipped to India, the Philippines, and Annam through Hong Kong every year.</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure: 1. Uncertain mining rights. The mountain owners, miners, kiln owners, and refiners are separated, losing the function of unified control and regulation. 2. Poor sales methods. Inconvenient transportation, high transportation costs, and reliance on Ning merchants are controlled by middlemen. For example, the market price in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Tianjin, and Shanghai is about 5 to 8 yuan per stone, while the sale at the Pingyang alum kiln is only 2.3 yuan. 3. The inappropriate local manufacturing method wastes a lot of ore quality, and by-products cannot be extracted and are completely discarded. (According to the Yellow Sea Chemical Research Institute of Tianjin Jiuda Company, there are preliminary Pingyang alum test publications dedicated to the research of alum residue by-products.) 4. The exploitation of the Shanghai and Hong Kong sales agencies.</p>
<p>Relief Methods: 1. The Pingyang County Government assembles the kilns and applies for a license in the name of the local government to control the operation. 2. Build a branch line from 溪 to Zaoxi to connect to the Pingyang Taishun highway. 3. Packaging grade should be unified style, and the manufacturing method should be improved by establishing a factory. 4. Raise 200,000 yuan to establish a production and sales cooperative.</p>

<h3>Water Patrol Team Cracks Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Recently, the county water patrol team received a tip that there were kidnapping thieves near Yinglong Temple. Inspector Fei Gongxia led four patrol boats and set off at about 3:00 AM last night (17th). They arrived north of Yinglong Temple and broke into the home of Shen Shousheng, arresting three ticket-watching bandits: Shen Yuda, Xia Ayong (also known as Yunsheng), and Xu Aba. They seized a Mauser pistol, 16 bullets, and rescued the hostages, Wang Shunfu, 71 years old, from Anzhuang Third Tu, Qingpu County, and Li Yinqi, 30 years old, from Guanzhuang Thirteenth Tu, Qingpu County, who were kidnapped on the 24th day of the ninth month of the old calendar. Also, Sun Zhifeng's son, Axiao, 18 years old, from Sangyuan Village, Fengjing, was kidnapped on the 25th day of the ninth month. It is said that the ringleader is He Amei, who was arrested and interrogated by the Fengxian County Government a few days ago. It is rumored that after He Amei was arrested, Shen Yuda took charge of the bandit den. Inspector Fei took the three bandits and three hostages back to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Public Security Bureau Smashes a Major Gambling Den</h3>
<p>Gambling is a common vice in our county, particularly rampant in the various teahouses. It goes on day and night. The other day, the County Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Office received a secret report stating that teahouse owners Li Jie and Jia A Jin of the Beixingyuan Teahouse in Beizhakou had set up a large gambling den, complete with cleverly designed secret doors, windows, and walls, as well as alarm lights. The operation was large-scale and attracted many gamblers, and the informant requested that police officers be dispatched to arrest them. Inspector Wang, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched undercover agents to investigate and confirm the situation. They also thoroughly examined the secret passages. Consequently, at 9 PM the other night, Inspector Wang personally led officers from the Supervisory Office, the Mobile Patrol Team, the Security Team, and all the officers from the Public Security Bureau's Fifth Branch, dividing them into seven groups. They disguised themselves and went to make the arrests. Inspector Wang ordered the officers to guard the seven secret passages, while he personally led the main force directly through the front door. Upon hearing the alarm, the gamblers scattered and fled in all directions. However, police officers were stationed at each secret passage, so all the gamblers were apprehended. A total of forty-two men and women were arrested. The teahouse owner, Li Jie, managed to avoid arrest by being out, but the salesman was caught on the spot. All were taken to the bureau. Yesterday, Section Chief Yi of the Third Section opened court and interrogated them one by one. The gamblers confessed to gambling without hesitation and were sentenced to a fine of fifteen yuan each. The teahouse owner, Jia A Jin, was fined twenty-two yuan as a warning. In addition, his teahouse license was revoked, and he was ordered to cease operations.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of the Jiangyin Branch Customs Post</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce previously convened a meeting of local gentry and merchants, resolving to request that the Jiangyin branch customs post of the Zhenjiang Customs be first converted into a place for loading and unloading goods, and then further developed into a trading port. The resolution was submitted to the Ministry, provincial authorities, customs offices, and the Supervisory Commissioner for review. The Ministry of Finance instructed the Customs Administration to order the Inspector General of Customs to investigate and approve the proposal. However, tax matters should follow the procedures for loading and unloading passengers and goods, and transshipment taxes should be paid separately at the first port of call or the port of origin. Yesterday, the Chengjiang Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to our county's Chamber of Commerce for verification and to inform merchants of all trades.</p>
<h3>Obstructing Land Price Declaration: Provincial Order for Arrest</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously decided at a provincial administrative meeting to conduct urban land price declarations in Wuxi and Nantong counties and revise the land price tax, ordering the counties to comply. This was met with widespread opposition from all sectors in our county and has been delayed for several months. Later, the Executive Yuan ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to amend the land price declaration methods and approved the suspension of land price tax collection. However, recently, various anonymous leaflets have suddenly appeared in the city, attacking the land price declaration in every possible way. At the same time, the Shanghai Shen and Xin newspapers published a misleading advertisement in the name of Hua Yishan, a local gentry, and 1,574 others, appealing for assistance from all sectors of the country. Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government was extremely angered after reading the newspaper. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed County Magistrate Yan, ordering him to investigate the instigators and arrest them for provincial prosecution. At the same time, the Land Price Declaration Office of our county also offered a reward of one hundred yuan to capture the mastermind and distributor of the leaflets. The County Government also ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest those who were obstructing the declaration.</p>

<h3>Opium Offender Escapes Over the Wall During Custody</h3>
<p>The County Government received a report from the Public Security Bureau stating that three opium offenders, Yu Hanbin, Wu Yunqing, and Xu Kunrong, denied smoking opium during interrogation and were sent to the County Opium Rehabilitation Center for custody and testing. It has been two days. The other night, the opium offenders Wu Hanbin and Xu Kunrong damaged the windows of the custody room and escaped over the wall. Yesterday (the 16th), the Director of the center, Sha Chunjia, reported this to the County Government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police officers to investigate and apprehend them.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Bank Provides Loans for Draught Cattle</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank believes that, in the disaster-stricken areas of various counties this year, farmers are suffering greatly, and they will inevitably be forced to sell their draught cattle. If no relief measures are taken, it will have a significant impact on next year's spring plowing. In order to proactively remedy this, the bank has specially launched loans for draught cattle and formulated ten measures, which have been submitted to the Supervisory Committee for approval. Special letters have been sent to all county branches to implement these measures uniformly. The original measures are as follows: 1. In order to facilitate farmers' raising of draught cattle, this bank will provide loans for draught cattle. 2. Any farmer who wants to sell their draught cattle or use their draught cattle as collateral can apply to this bank for such loans. 3. The draught cattle used as collateral must be strong and suitable for agricultural work (aged between three and eight years). The cattle will be branded by this bank (with a brand on the horn). 4. The draught cattle used as collateral in this bank should be insured for cattle life insurance by the bank on behalf of the farmer to ensure safety. The insurance premium will be offered at the most favorable rate. If a disease occurs, this bank should also assist in prevention and treatment and provide various convenient services. 5. This loan is limited to cooperative societies organized by farmers or other organizations with joint liability, and must have the township and district heads as witnesses and reliable shops or impartial individuals as guarantors for repayment. 6. This loan should not exceed 60% of the estimated value of the draught cattle used as collateral. 7. The loan term should not exceed eight months. 8. During the loan period, the borrowers must supervise each other's draught cattle. Without the consent of this bank, the cattle owner must not privately sell or slaughter the draught cattle. If this bank finds out about the above, other joint borrowers and guarantors for repayment shall be responsible for the repayment. 9. When the loan is due, the borrowers must repay the loan principal and interest in full. If the loan is overdue for more than one month and is not repaid, this bank may freely sell the draught cattle used as collateral to offset the loan principal and interest and compensate for all expenses incurred by this bank due to this loan. If there is a surplus, it will be returned. 10. Matters not specified in these measures shall be handled in accordance with this bank's various loan regulations.</p>

<h3>Coolies of Various Vehicles Suddenly Strike</h3>
<p>The coolies of unique small carts, water carts, firewood carts, and other vehicles in this city suddenly went on strike yesterday because the Public Security Bureau prohibited passage through the streets of Fuyunmen to Duozi Street and restricted the load they could carry. They went to the Chamber of Commerce and the County Government to petition. After the Public Security Bureau explained the situation and eased their grievances, the coolies dispersed. It is reported that County Magistrate Ma, in order to observe the situation of the coolies and to prevent unscrupulous elements from being involved, specially issued a notice to ensure the stability of their livelihoods. He also ordered the Public Security Bureau to revise the detour signs and properly assign police officers to provide guidance at all times. In addition, he sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they provide proper guidance if similar incidents occur in the future to avoid trouble.</p>

<h3>Government Employee Arrested for Drug Use</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhengfang, a tax collector at the County Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office (a Shanghai native, and the younger brother of the office director Zhu Yunsheng), was found smoking red pills at the Yongtai Inn in Haifu Town at around 8 PM the other day (the 15th). Someone secretly reported this to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police officers to search the premises. They found red pills and opium paraphernalia. Zhu Zhengfang was arrested along with the evidence and taken to the bureau before being sent to the County Government for interrogation. After County Magistrate Chen interrogated him, he found that Zhu, as a government employee, was smoking red pills, which was a blatant disregard for the law. He immediately ordered him to be detained and sent to the Nantong District Security Command for punishment under military law within a few days.</p>

<h3>Sealing Up the Silk Factory Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, based on a report about the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Factory Trade Association Preparatory Committee's announcement and arrest warrants for He Ping and Qiu Meng for fleeing the country, as well as a rejection of the Construction Department's Qiu Meng's control policy, found that the government itself has the right to weigh the control of silk, and if the people have opinions, they can only present them through legal procedures. Now they are wantonly slandering and offering rewards for arrest. Furthermore, the association has not been approved for registration and fundamentally has no legal standing. In addition to ordering the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to investigate and immediately close it down, the personnel in charge will be arrested.</p>

<h3>Directors Yang and Feng in Shanghai to Discuss Promoting National Sugar</h3>
<p>Banks Agree in Principle to Invest</p>
<p>Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Guangxi Province, and Feng Rui, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Province, arrived in Shanghai one after the other to negotiate bank loans for promoting domestic sugar. Director Yang went to Hangzhou yesterday to inspect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and Director Feng will go to Beijing to report. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Goes to Hangzhou</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Guangxi Province, contacted the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank to discuss investing in the construction of the Liuzhou Sugar Factory. At the same time, he investigated the sales of domestic sugar in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he took the Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train to Hangzhou to inspect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After returning to Shanghai, he will take a ship back to Guangxi Province. It is reported that the investigation of the sales of domestic sugar in Shanghai and the negotiation of investment in the construction of the sugar factory have been completed.</p>
<p>Negotiating Investment</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Feng Rui, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Province, contacted Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, and Zou Bingwen, Assistant Manager, for several days to discuss investing in the construction of four new mechanized national sugar factories and providing loans for sugarcane production in Guangdong Province. He will go to Beijing to report to the central government. After returning to Shanghai, he will return to Guangdong Province. It is reported that the banks have agreed in principle to the investment, and a decision can be made after further consultation.</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Sugar</p>
<p>The machinery for the four new mechanized sugar factories in Guangdong is being actively installed and is scheduled to be shipped simultaneously in January next year. Guangxi plans to build a new sugar factory in Liuzhou, and preparations are underway. It will be completed soon. This time, Directors Feng and Yang came to Shanghai and contacted Zheng Xiangzhou, Chairman of the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, Zheng Zernan, Supervisory Committee, etc., to discuss the promotion of domestic sugar after the goods are shipped. The results were very good.</p>
<h3>Song Faxiang Informs Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Song Returns to His Post on the 22nd</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Song Faxiang, our country's Consul-General in the Dutch East Indies, returned to the country last month to attend the Fifth National Congress. Because the congress was postponed, he went north to inspect Tianjin and other places. He has now returned to Shanghai. According to Mr. Song, he will take the Chichasada Nerry ship to Xiamen this Thursday (the 22nd) to explain the situation to overseas Chinese. On the second of next month, he will go to Hong Kong from Xiamen to discuss the promotion of domestic goods with the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. On the fourth, he will take a ship from Hong Kong back to Batavia and arrive on the eleventh. Mr. Song also said that he was warmly received by the domestic goods industry in Shanghai the other night, but the time was short and he did not say everything. Therefore, he added a few words to inform the domestic goods manufacturers.</p>
<p>What Should Be Noted　The following points should be specially noted by domestic manufacturers: 1. What is the environment of the destination? How should the goods be packaged? 2. Shipping procedures. 3. How to write invoices in Western languages and bank mortgage procedures. 4. How to make and distribute product samples. 5. How to calculate packing fees to the destination by ship. 6. The currency of the Dutch East Indies should be calculated in advance to avoid excessive exchange rate differences.</p>
<p>What Should Be Improved　The following points must be improved: 1. They often take advantage of the separation between domestic manufacturers and the Dutch East Indies market to become general agents, which is beyond their capability. The number of handovers increases, and the cost naturally increases. Once there is too much inventory and it cannot be sold, they will inevitably be disappointed. 2. Lack of large-scale capital. 3. For sales techniques, stick to old methods and do not follow the trend of world commercial competition. 4. Past history tells us that the credit of agents in Nanyang is not good in China. Local businesses often take the opportunity to go bankrupt and get rich. Therefore, manufacturers are also wary.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Cotton from Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Xinjiang Begins to Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Improvement Institute Assigns a Special Commissioner to Handle Transportation</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee and the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute, affiliated with Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and other places, produced approximately 89,300 dan of cotton this year. After Shanghai and other banks reallocated funds for cotton transportation and sales, the Improvement Institute has assigned transportation commissioners, one stationed in Weinan to handle the cotton of various cooperatives in Shaanxi, and one stationed in Lingbao to handle the cotton of various cooperatives in Henan and Shanxi. They have now begun to load freight cars on the Longhai Railway and transport them to the temporary wharf at Sunjiashan in Haizhou, and then load them onto China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships to Shanghai. The first batch of cotton will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>The Wuhu-Zha Railway, Wuhu-Sun Section, is Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang Personally Goes to Inspect</p>
<p>The Nanjing-Wuhu Section Will Open to Traffic Next Spring</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Wuhu-Zha Railway, built by the Jiangnan Railway Company, has made rapid progress since construction began last year. According to the company, the Wuhu-Zha Railway will be extended to Nanjing in order to connect with the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. The roadbed construction of the Nanjing-Wuhu section has been 70-80% completed. The Datang Bridge in Dangtu has started construction, and track laying will begin soon. It is expected that it will be open to traffic in March next spring. The Wuhu-Xuan section now carries passengers and goods. The Xuan-Sun section (Xuan City to Sunjiabu) has been completed and tested. It is scheduled to officially sell passenger tickets and open to traffic tomorrow (the 20th). Mr. Zhang Jingjiang of the company will go to Wuhu and Xuan City to inspect it.</p>
<h3>Special Survey of Domestic Goods Industry</h3>
<p>(9) Seasoning Industry</p>
<p>The seasoning industry is most developed in Japan. Europe and the United States have not yet created it. Our country's seasoning products began in the spring of the 12th year of the Republic of China with the creation of Tianchu MSG. Subsequently, other manufacturers emerged, including Gentai, China Chemical Industry, and Tianyi. The exquisite exports not only defeated Japanese MSG but also sold some products to the United States and the South Seas Islands. However, due to various reasons, Japanese goods have become popular again, and domestic products have been hit hard. Recently, I visited Mr. Yu Xueyang of Tianchu, Shui Weichen and Wang Yinquan of Tianyi Factory, who told me the general situation of the industry as follows:</p>
<p>There are not many seasoning companies, and there is no trade association. There is only a trade group attached to the Machinery Industry Federation. The members of the trade group include Tianchu, Tianyi, China Chemical Industry, Tiansheng, and Taiyi. Those who have not joined the trade group include Tianyuan and Tianxiang. There are also those who only have products but no factories. There is only one Tianyuan company that has branches outside of Shanghai. The factories that have failed and closed down include Gentai, Tianran, Hongfu, and Weizhong. The capital of each factory ranges from 500,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, totaling more than one million yuan. In terms of production capacity, Tianchu can produce 2,000 pounds per day, Tianyi can produce 1,000 pounds per day, and other factories can produce 200-300 pounds. Due to poor sales, most factories have reduced production. Therefore, the total output of each factory is currently no more than 2,000 pounds. The products are divided into powder and liquid. Those belonging to the powder category include Tianchu MSG, Tianyi Weimu, China Chemical Industry's Guanyin Powder, Taiyi's Maiting Powder, Tiansheng's Ziwei Su, Tianyuan's Wei Wang, and Tianxiang's Wei Bao. Those belonging to the liquid category include Tianchu's Soy Sauce Essence, Tianyi's Weimu Juice, and China Chemical Industry's Hundred Times and Ten Times Soy Sauce Essence. Although the names are different, they are all seasonings. The packaging is divided into bottled and canned. Bottled packaging has less capacity and is sold to household users. It can be divided into sizes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Generally, size 1 can hold 1.6 liang, size 2 is 8 qian, size 3 is 4 qian, and size 4 is 2 qian. Canned packaging has more capacity and is sold to restaurants and bars. There are 10 liang cans and 20 liang cans. The annual turnover is 4 million yuan, and sales reach the whole country. Every year, there is still 100,000-200,000 yuan worth of goods sold to the United States and the South Seas Islands. However, recently, Japanese goods have been cheap. Taking a 10 liang can as an example, domestic products sell for 3.3-3.4 yuan per can, while Japanese goods only sell for 2.3-2.4 yuan, a difference of 1 yuan. Therefore, the business of domestic products has been hit hard. But one thing is gratifying, the important raw materials for seasonings, wheat gluten and hydrochloric acid, can now be supplied by ourselves. Most of the wheat gluten is made by ourselves, and a small amount is purchased from wheat gluten workshops. The hydrochloric acid is supplied by the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, hosted by the owner of Tianchu Factory, and the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry, jointly established by Tianyi Factory. The hydrochloric acid of Tianyuan was taken from by the city's seasoning powder manufacturers during the boycott of Japanese goods. The production capacity of hydrochloric acid is more than enough to supply the whole country. When asked about the current situation of Japanese goods imports, Mr. Wang said that there are still millions of yuan every year, and there is an increasing trend. The Japanese Mitsui Bussan's Aji-no-moto is deeply impressed by the Chinese people. Some people call seasonings Aji-no-moto, as if Aji-no-moto is the general term for seasonings. Since the movement to resist Japanese goods, Japanese merchants have changed their appearance, shipping in yellow and white cans without trademarks or signs, or importing them as flour. Imports have been particularly strong recently. Because the Japanese gold price has fallen and the selling price is low, distributors can make huge profits and are happy to promote them. Buyers cannot distinguish between true and false and are easily deceived. In the mainland, they openly display them and set up trademarks, but there are many names, or they falsely claim to be manufactured in Shanghai. Therefore, on the surface, it seems that Japanese goods have been driven out, but in fact, it is not. Mr. Yu said that the future of the industry is not optimistic. With the sluggish market in various places, this product ultimately belongs to the consumer and there is an oversupply. Although there are few companies in the industry, cheap competition is inevitable. It is heard that the Weizhong and Tianran factories, which have closed down, will also resume business. Therefore, the number of companies in the future will increase, and the result may be the road to shoddy workmanship. The reporter hopes that the industry will cooperate sincerely and make technical improvements, rather than engage in unnecessary competition, drive out Japanese goods, and promote sales to European and American markets. In particular, I hope that Chinese people will purchase domestic goods, so that the industry has a future. (Jing Gen)</p>

<h3>Reconsideration of the Crime of Adultery in the New Chinese Criminal Code</h3>
<p>The Future Result Will Be One of Two Options</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Legislative Yuan recently passed Article 239 of the draft Criminal Code, which stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, and the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment. However, if a married man commits adultery with another person, there is no legal provision for punishment, which has led to fierce protests from women's circles nationwide. Now, the Central Political Conference has approved, in accordance with the principle of gender equality, referring the matter back to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The outcome of the reconsideration is attracting considerable attention from people across the country. According to reliable sources, the result of the reconsideration will be one of two options. One is that a married woman or a married man who commits adultery with another person will be punished equally. However, in order to take into account the practical difficulties of the latter, an addendum must be added, that is, to stipulate that this law shall only apply and take effect after it is promulgated, or that one of the parties must wait until after the divorce before suing the other party for adultery. At present, the majority of the legislators advocate that neither a married woman nor a married man who commits adultery with another person should be punished, and that the responsibility for punishment and sanctions should be left to society, public opinion, personal moral cultivation, academic research, and religious belief. It is feared that the result of the reconsideration will not undergo much change.</p>
<h3>Prior of the Belgian Roofen Abbey Arrives in China</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Abbey in Shunqing, Sichuan</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Saint Andrew's Abbey of Roofen in Belgium is the abbey where Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, former Premier of China, is cloistered. The Prior of the abbey, Father Nanmu, initiated and established the first Benedictine monastery in the northwest of Shunqing, Sichuan, China, eight years ago. It has been established for many years and is roughly in scale. Now, it is learned that Father Nanmu set out for China from Marseille, France, on the Dutch Company's ship Siberook on October 12th, first going to Java for inspection. On November 8th, he boarded the company's Chishadani mail ship to Shanghai, and will arrive at the port today (the 19th). Accompanying him is the first Chinese Benedictine monk, Father Yang Anran. Yang is an overseas Chinese from Java, originally from Fujian, and is proficient in many languages. He was ordained as a priest last year and obtained a doctorate in theology this year. Also accompanying him is Father Wen Jielai, an Italian priest of the same order, who served as a middle school professor and dean of studies at Saint Andrew's Abbey for six years and is proficient in many languages. Both men are excellent in character and learning and will serve at the four branch abbeys. As for the Prior Nanmu, he will go to Beijing within days to meet Archbishop Cai Ning (who recently arrived in Beijing from Wuhu). After being introduced by Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, he will visit Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and then go to Shunqing, Sichuan, to inspect the Xishan branch abbey.</p>

<h3>Sailors Urge Exemption from Handbook Fees</h3>
<p>Various Organizations Jointly Petition</p>
<p>Central Government Orders the Maritime Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau recently handled the registration of lower-level crew members and charged each person a handbook fee of two yuan. The various maritime workers, due to their low salaries, were unable to pay the fee, and unanimously requested the various maritime organizations to forward a petition to the central government requesting an exemption. Yan Ying General Office, Yan Ying South Office, Yan Ying Tongxing Society, Maritime Joint Righteousness Society, Maritime Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Society, Southern Jun'an Seaman Joint Charity Society, Northern Jun'an Seaman Public Office, and others, convened other maritime organizations and representatives of various ship crew members at the Southern Jun'an Seaman Joint Charity Society, and unanimously resolved to jointly submit a petition to the Special Party Department of Chinese Seamen, the Seamen's Union, and to the Central Executive Committee, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and the Ministry of Communications, requesting exemption from the fee. The original text is excerpted below: "Petition for the Maritime Affairs Bureau to exempt workers who are unable to pay the handbook fee, in order to alleviate the workers' hardship. According to members of the stoker and seaman departments of our affiliated societies, the Maritime Affairs Bureau recently ordered workers in the stoker and seaman departments to register with the bureau within a deadline and collect a handbook fee of two yuan per person. The workers earn their wages through blood and sweat each month, and after deducting food expenses, only fifteen or sixteen yuan remain. At this time of high economic pressure, it is already difficult to support their families with these meager wages. How can they possibly pay this exorbitant fee? Moreover, the cost of printing this handbook is at most only two corners per book, but now it is charged ten times its value, asking the workers to compensate, which is contrary to the government's principle of protecting workers. We respectfully request that you forward a petition to the central committee to grant an exemption in order to show consideration for the situation. According to this, the Maritime Affairs Bureau's handling of the registration of lower-level crew members this time was originally intended to unify management technically, and our affiliated societies and crew members all understand this and express their full compliance. However, upon investigation, the economic strength of upper-level crew members and lower-level workers is vastly different, and it seems difficult to collect fees in the same way. The monthly salary of upper-level crew members is at least over one hundred yuan, while the monthly salary of lower-level crew members is at most only sixteen or seventeen yuan. As for their burdens, there is no major difference. This is the first reason why we have to request exemption. Upon investigation, the cost of printing the handbook issued by the Maritime Affairs Bureau is indeed extremely low. As a government-sponsored agency, in order to seek welfare for crew members, it should not begrudge this small fee and insist that crew members compensate at ten times the value. This is the second reason why an exemption should be requested. Upon investigation, various countries in the East and West also issue similar handbooks to crew members for management, but the fees are minimal. The purpose is to focus on the service workers on foreign ships. The handbook is nothing less than a passport for the crew member to go abroad. Whenever the ship sails to the territorial waters of another country, its competent authority signs on the handbook as proof of the crew member's nationality and artistic skills. Now, the Maritime Affairs Bureau neglects the crew members serving on foreign ships and focuses exclusively on the workers in the inland sea. This is inconsistent with unified management and lacks fairness in treatment. Our affiliated societies have the purpose of jointly seeking welfare for workers, and cannot but jointly submit a petition for the workers to plead for their lives. We beseech your association to take pity on the situation below and approve an order to the Maritime Affairs Bureau to make appropriate changes and exempt the fees in order to alleviate the hardship of the workers and avoid inciting incidents. We are awaiting your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Central Party Department, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee, and the Ministry of Communications."</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Handles the Case of Rice Shipped from Guangdong to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Orders Importers to Pay Deposits</p>
<p>Regarding the case of rice shipped from Guangdong to Shanghai by Guangzhou's Wufengtai, Feng Maochanglong, and other firms on ships such as the Yushun, Shandong, and Taiyuan, which was detained by the Customs, the Guangzhou Rice Milling Industry and Rice Bran Industry Associations have repeatedly sent letters stating that it is not foreign rice and requesting its release. This matter has now been ordered by the Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs to be inspected. After investigation, the shape and quality of the rice are indeed no different from Saigon rice. According to Tax Inspector Borel, if the importers can pay the full rice price as a deposit, they can be released first. If the investigation later shows that it should still be regarded as domestic rice, the deposit will be refunded.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Plans a Comprehensive Approach to Relieving Unemployed Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Remarks by Commissioner Xu Tongxiong</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, in recent years, overseas Chinese have been affected by the global recession, and the number of unemployed has increased. Moreover, due to the expulsion of overseas Chinese by various countries, they have had no choice but to pack up and return home. Their dire situation is unbearable to witness. I requested Mr. Xu Tongxiong of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to inquire about measures to relieve unemployed returned overseas Chinese. According to Mr. Xu's remarks, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in order to relieve unemployed overseas Chinese, has specially organized a Committee for the Relief of Unemployed Overseas Chinese, which has been established to conduct specialized research on relieving unemployed overseas Chinese. It is now in the process of drafting various relief measures, which will be completed and implemented within days.</p>
<p>The Completion of Le Village As for the establishment of Qiaole Village by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission near Xuancheng County, Anhui, it has also been completely constructed. The purpose of building it is to enable unemployed overseas Chinese to engage in cultivation and become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Conditions for Land Reclamation The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously obtained the approval of the Standing Committee to plan the outline of land reclamation in Qiaole Village. The conditions for land reclamation are as follows: 1. Those who have an overseas Chinese registration certificate or have sufficient documents to prove that they are indeed unemployed overseas Chinese. 2. Those who have a responsible letter of introduction from overseas Chinese associations or local party branches and consulates. 3. Those who are between the ages of seventeen and sixty, have the ability to reclaim land, are hardworking and resilient, have no bad habits, and have no chronic diseases. As for the land reclamation methods, they are divided into three types: (A) self-funded land reclamation, (B) loan-funded land reclamation, and (C) labor-capital cooperation land reclamation. The leased land for each reclaimed citizen shall not exceed thirty mu. The lease term is set at fifty years. The rent is as follows: no rent for the first to third years, two corners of ocean per mu per year for the fourth to tenth years, three corners of ocean per mu per year for the eleventh to twentieth years, four corners of ocean per mu per year for the twenty-first to thirtieth years, five corners of ocean per mu per year for the thirty-first to fortieth years, and five corners of ocean per mu per year for the forty-first to fiftieth years. The internal organization of the village includes a management office, a cooperative, a farm, and a warehouse. The farm is further divided into three types: self-funded, loan-funded, and labor-funded cooperation.</p>
<h3>The Haining Disaster Relief Association Held a Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Haining Drought Disaster Relief Association held its twelfth standing committee meeting at the Gongdelin Hall at 8:00 PM last night. More than twenty people, including Xu Shenru, Zha Zhongjian, Zhou Wusan, Wang Weigeng, Zhu Yanqing, Shen Huachen, Pan Gengsheng, and Xu Lingyun, attended. Xu Shenru chaired the meeting and reported on the county government's reply telegram, which had requested the provincial government to allocate 1,000 dan of wheat seeds, and on relief letters and telegrams received from various parties. As a result of the discussion: 1. The case of the county government's official letter sending the expense booklets for November of the First District Nursing Home and October of the Third District Welfare Center, requesting review, was resolved to be sent to Commissioner Xu and Secretary Wang for review. 2. The proposal to use the 1,000 yuan designated by the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association for relief in the First District to purchase rice for distribution together was resolved to approve the joint purchase of rice, appropriately increase the distribution, and report the added poor households to the association. 3. The proposal that after the relief rice from the First District is shipped from Xia to Ning, the county government should be notified to send personnel to jointly supervise the measurement and designate personnel to assist in the implementation of relief matters was resolved to send a letter to the Bodhi Dharma Association, requesting that it forward a letter to the director of relief in the First District, purchasing relief rice from Mr. Li Hongxiang of Guangshun in Xia Shi, according to the original amount of 11,000 yuan (including the 1,000 yuan from the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Association, the funds will be remitted upon receipt of the letter). As for the county government's supervision of the measurement and assistance in relief affairs, it should be handled accordingly. 4. The county government's inquiry on how to select key disaster relief matters to be handled in this county was resolved that urgent relief is now being reviewed separately by various charitable groups and will begin distribution in the near future. In terms of labor relief, it should wait for the provincial funds to arrive and determine the number before making an overall plan.</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Pleads for the Disaster Victims in Southeast China</h3>
<p>Sends Separate Letters to the Chairmen of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan to Appeal</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling, Chairman of the World Red Cross Society of China, traveled south this time. In view of the severe disaster in the southeastern provinces, a large sum of money is needed to save them from their plight. He specially sent separate letters from Shanghai to Chairman Huang Yingbai of Beiping, and to the chairmen of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, stating the disaster situation and pleading for the people of Southeast China. The words are urgent and filled with tears. The text of the letter is excerpted below. Respectfully, Xiling traveled south this time to attend the National Child Welfare Conference and raise funds for relief in the southeastern provinces. For more than a month, according to various investigation reports, the disaster area in the Southeast covers several provinces. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. I will briefly describe it to you. In the Southeast, disasters have occurred frequently in recent years, and rural areas have long been bankrupt. This year, in the summer, the rainfall was not timely, and drought occurred, causing farmland to become cracked and overgrown. Cries of misery are heard everywhere, and refugees are seen on the roads. Families that were once wealthy have become poor households, and the poorest households have become starving corpses. The tragic scene of stripping bark from trees and digging up grass roots, with nothing left to eat, and entire families committing suicide by hanging themselves has been seen repeatedly. In an instant, the harsh winter will arrive.</p>
<p>Without food or clothing, suffering from hunger and cold, the severity of the disaster will be even greater than it is today. Such a terrible disaster requires a large sum of relief money to save them from their plight. Although various charitable organizations here and our association have already raised funds for relief, the disaster area is too large, and it is like a cart of firewood to put out a burning cart, and a cup of water to put out a fire. Xiling paces back and forth all night, unable to come up with a solution. I recall that in the past, during the disasters in the North, various charitable organizations and philanthropists in the Southeast either ran around to appeal for help to save the disaster victims, or personally went to the disaster area to distribute urgent relief, rushing forward without hesitation. The amount of relief money raised was huge, nearly ten million, all from the contributions of various sectors in the Southeast. At that time, although the financial situation was said to be exhausted, there was still room for maneuver, so they were still able to work hard to raise relief funds for other provinces in the midst of the recession. Who would have thought that the commercial market would suffer a setback and that the exhaustion of financial resources in various places would be a hundred times greater than before in this unprecedented disaster. Self-help is insufficient. Xiling cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the millions of disaster victims waiting to be fed. Although the northern provinces are also suffering from localized disasters, they are slightly less severe than those in the Southeast. Considering the meaning of mutual assistance and repayment, the people of the North should make an effort to provide relief. I have always admired your compassion and lack of prejudice. I sincerely hope that you will take pity on the plight of the disaster victims in the southeastern provinces, make a public appeal to arouse the sympathy of all sectors, and jointly seek salvation, so that humanitarianism and righteousness can flow in. Or send personnel to personally visit the disaster area to immediately provide urgent relief to alleviate the suffering. Xiling is weak and ill and cannot run around for the disaster victims. I will simply act as a watchman and cry out on their behalf. I respectfully ask for your attention to my urgent words. My tears mingle with ink. I look forward to your kindness.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Heng Society's Autumn Reunion</h3>

<p>Inspector Ye and Zhu Hanbo of the Gordon Road Patrol Station, on the 18th of this month, uncovered red pill manufacturing organs at 709 Gordon Road and 49 Lane 4, 685 United Lane on the same road. The criminals Zhang Youjun, Zhou Jinshan, and Zhou Wangshi were arrested, and eight bags of red pills and manufacturing equipment were confiscated. The whole situation was reported to the Special Court and the defendants were detained, as reported in this newspaper. After investigation, the Patrol Station found that the owner of the organs was named Yu Zhongxian, who lived at No. 4, Laojuqing Lane, Xinzha Road. They secretly went to arrest him some time ago, but Xiao had already fled after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi came to the criminal court to continue the hearing of the case and clarified the facts. Zhang Youjun was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for jointly selling opium substitutes and fined two thousand yuan. Zhou Jinshan and Zhou Wangshi were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for helping to manufacture opium substitutes. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was to be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. If the fine is not paid in full, it will be converted to one day of imprisonment for every three yuan. The red pill equipment and other items were confiscated according to the list.</p>

<h3>Suicide Out of Anger Due to Wife's Infidelity</h3>
<p>Last night, a traveler came to Room 318 of the Xin Xin Hotel at Zhengjia Wooden Bridge on Avenue Edward VII. He claimed to be Cai Guo'an from Pudong, 35 years old, who was in the sock business. Because his wife had committed adultery, he had an argument and suddenly had thoughts of death. At 11:25 yesterday morning, he committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. He had written two letters of farewell in advance. After he was discovered, he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died at 2 p.m.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving the Abbess of Wanfu Temple</h3>
<p>Monk Xiuchan Files Suit for Handover of Documents</p>
<p>Evidence Suspected of Being Forged</p>
<p>A lawsuit involving the abbess (female nun) of Wanfu Temple on Datong Road in Zhabei, and two female nuns, Shang Xiuchan and Zi Xiuxiu, over the issue of identity, has concluded after three trials. Zi Xiuxiu lost the case, and it was ruled that Xiuchan should take over as abbess. The long-standing identity issue has finally come to an end. However, most of the property deeds of the temple are still with Zi Xiuxiu and have not been handed over. Xiuchan has repeatedly demanded them without success. Therefore, she recently hired lawyer Tang Yingsong to file a lawsuit in the local court for the handover of the documents, stating that all the deeds left by the founding ancestor Lianqing were taken and hidden by the defendant Zi Xiuxiu (the total value of the temple property is estimated to be over 9,000 yuan). She requested that Zi Xiuxiu be ordered to hand over the documents so that she could take back the management of the property. The defendant, female nun Zi Xiuxiu, hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Wang Jishi to file a defense. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Jingmian opened a court hearing. Both parties attended with their lawyers. The judge questioned the plaintiff and defendant briefly. He then examined the rent receipt presented by the witness Ji Weixi (tenant) on behalf of the plaintiff (Ji pays an annual rent of 45 yuan). The stamp affixed to it was a temporary supplement, which seemed to be forged. He ordered the plaintiff female nun Xiuchan and the witness Ji Weixi to be released on bail, pending further investigation and a subsequent hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Stores, One in Lujiabang and One in the Bund, Robbed</h3>
<p>Electrical Supply Store Robbed for Small Amount</p>
<p>Customs Brokerage Firm Suffered Greater Losses</p>
<p>The Jinming Electrical Supply Store on Lujiabang Road in Nanshi and the Tongxinggong Customs Brokerage Firm on the upper floor of the Hengxingxiang Watch Store on East Gate Road of the Bund were both robbed of property last night. The two cases are reported separately below.</p>
<p>Jinming Electrical Supply Store</p>
<p>The Jinming Electrical Supply Store at 1009 Lujiabang Road outside Xiaoximen in Nanshi is owned by Li Shunjin. It has been in business for many years and is doing well, attracting the attention of bandits. At around 10:30 last night, three robbers with local accents wearing gray long gowns broke into the store armed with weapons. Under the pretense of buying electrical supplies, they pulled out pistols, forbade anyone from making a sound, and then ransacked the place. They stole 39 yuan in cash, five gold rings, and two pairs of gold earrings. After the robbery, the bandits fled north.</p>
<p>Tongxinggong Customs Brokerage Firm</p>
<p>At around 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, while Ruan Huacheng and others at the Tongxinggong Customs Brokerage Firm, located on the upper floor of the Hengxingxiang Watch Store on East Gate Road of the Bund were having dinner, six robbers broke in, including five dressed in blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and one in a long gown. They spoke with Pudong and Jiangbei accents. Four of the robbers carried pistols. They robbed 124 yuan in cash, five watches, one gold chain, one gold hook, and other jewelry and clothing of considerable value. Afterwards, the store owner reported the robbery to the 16th Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation and arrest of the criminals.</p>
<h3>Ship Owner Insults Female Lover, Women's Groups Jointly Intervene</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Women's Advancement Association, on behalf of Cantonese female doctor Li Bingyan, stated that the Norwegian ship owner of the Wuyang steamer, Naguishi, attempted to rape her three times and made obscene remarks, insulting the Chinese people. Although the Navigation Administration Bureau has dismissed the ship owner and is investigating the matter, in order to warn others against similar behavior, it has been decided to jointly convene all women's groups in the city, such as the Women's League, the Women's Temperance Society, the Women's Voice Society, the Chinese Women's Society, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Young Women's Association, etc., to organize regular meetings with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Journalists' Association, the First Special District Citizens' Association, the Chinese Merchant Ship Masters' Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Cantonese Commercial Joint Association, the Cantonese Association in Shanghai, the Sun Yat-sen Cantonese Association in Shanghai, the National Medical Association, the National Medical College, the National Medical College Sun Yat-sen Alumni Association, and other legal entities to discuss the matter and maintain maritime safety.</p>
<h3>Private Passenger Cars in the Urban Area Can Pay License Fees Biannually</h3>
<p>Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter Seasons Can Be Paid Simultaneously</p>
<p>In order to simplify the quarterly payment of license fees for private passenger cars, the Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice the day before yesterday to all car owners, adding a biannual payment option, which will be implemented next year. The original text reads: "The payment of license fees for private passenger cars in this city is currently done on a quarterly basis. In order to facilitate car owners and reduce the hassle of license fee procedures, starting from the spring of the 24th year, in addition to the existing quarterly payment, a biannual payment option will be added. Those who voluntarily pay the fees for half a year at once can pay for the spring and summer seasons together (i.e., January to June), and the autumn and winter seasons together (i.e., July to December). When paying the fees, they will receive license plates for both seasons. Car owners who receive the license plates should display them quarterly for inspection. If a vehicle with biannual payment is only used for one season, the fees for the remaining season can be refunded in full when the license plate is returned before the beginning of that season. However, no refunds will be issued after the beginning of that season. This is hereby notified."</p>

<p>The parade route was as follows: the entire group gathered at the Penglai Market in Ximen at 5:00 p.m., and departed at 7:00 p.m., parading through Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and the city wall. The Self-Defense Corps and Boy Scouts led the way, followed by the orphanage military band and the Ai Qun Girls' School's charge lanterns. In the middle were the lanterns from various participating factories, and the Boy Scouts brought up the rear. The order was good, and the crowd of onlookers was huge. The group did not disband at the Penglai Market until midnight.</p>
<h3>Examples of Slogans</h3>
<p>The slogans prepared by the association for the lanterns included: [1. All of our citizens, regardless of gender, must use national goods. 2. If women use national goods, men should naturally use national goods together. 3. Women's national goods are the fundamental way to promote national goods. 4. As long as it is a national product, even if it is a little simple, it is good. 5. If it is not a national product, the more luxurious it is, the more shameful it is. 6. Sir, do you see that the Eight Daojiang District is using national goods all over? 7. Sir, do you see that his family, isn't the whole family using national goods? 8. Women's advocacy of national goods is the foundation of a wealthy country. 9. Women are the mothers of the nation, and using national goods is the mother of national prosperity. 10. Use national goods starting from the family, and in the blink of an eye, it will spread throughout the whole society. 11. We believe that the most beautiful thing is national goods, and we beautiful women naturally love to use national goods.] These words were quite eye-catching.</p>
<h3>Completion Ceremony of New Building for the Municipal Buddhist Association's Orphanage</h3>
<p>Over 200 People Attend, Including Wang Yiting</p>
<p>Guan Jiongzhi Reports on the Development of the Orphanage</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Buddhist Association's Orphanage held a completion ceremony for its new building yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. Guests attending included Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Shi Shengzhi, and Mao Yun, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Jizhi, the representative of the Orphanage, Qian Shoutie, the representative of the Mongolian and Tibetan Institute, and over 200 others. The ceremony was held as scheduled. First, Guan Jiongzhi, the director of the orphanage, presided over the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the orphanage's new building was completed today, and the colleagues were honored that the elders of the mountains and the benefactors from all walks of life had come to guide and visit. The reason for the establishment of the orphanage was that the colleagues of the Municipal Buddhist Association felt that the spirit of Mahayana Buddhism was to save those in distress and to benefit the public. They also felt that most of the poor children everywhere did not have the opportunity to be educated. Today's children are the important members of the future society and the masters of the future country, which is extremely important. Therefore, funds were raised to establish this orphanage. At that time, Abbot Kaisheng of Baolian Temple showed great compassion and gave up all the remaining rooms in the temple as the site of the orphanage. Due to financial reasons, the number of students was initially limited to 50. Although the scope was very small, the colleagues felt the great responsibility. Since its establishment, it has been nearly two years. Due to the increasing number of children requesting to join, the Buddhist Association decided to increase the number to 30, for a total of 80. The curriculum is a combination of education and cultivation, with equal emphasis on work and study. When the children first entered the orphanage, most of them had no clothes or food and were physically weak. Now their physique has gradually become stronger, and they mostly know how to work hard in academic subjects and crafts. However, since the orphanage was established, there has been no fixed fund, and the regular expenses are all borne by the colleagues of the Buddhist Association. All equipment is lacking, and we sincerely ask you to give more guidance and assistance so that this small group can gradually develop. Then, Da Bei Xingkong of the Chinese Buddhist Association and Zhu Jifang, the director of the World Buddhist Lay Association, gave speeches in succession. After the ceremony, Director Guan led the guests to visit the dormitory of the charity students and the achievements room for work and study, and solicited criticism from the guests. Then tea and refreshments were served and photos were taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Elimination of Miscellaneous Tax on Fishing Households in the County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County's various miscellaneous taxes in various districts were previously ordered by the Finance Office to be abolished and suspended due to their diverse nature and numerous burdens. Now, a type of harsh and miscellaneous tax on fishing households has been found, which will be abolished as the third batch. Therefore, the Finance Office ordered the County Government to abolish the fishing household tax immediately, except for other taxes that should still be reorganized in accordance with the previous order. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan immediately instructed the county's miscellaneous tax collection office to abolish and suspend the fishing household tax with immediate effect.</p>
<h3>The Headquarters and Branches of the Four Banks Savings Society Move to a New Location</h3>
<p>Business Begins Today, Branches Add Services</p>
<p>Shanghai Headquarters and Reserve Treasury Remain at Original Location</p>
<p>The new twelve-story building built by the Four Banks Savings Society at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road was completed last month. Except for the upper floors, which have been completely rented by the newly established International Hotel, the ground floor is the new location of the society. Yesterday, the headquarters and branches of the society moved in simultaneously and added new services. Business is scheduled to begin today. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Headquarters and Branches Moved In Yesterday</p>
<p>After the building was completed last month, the International Hotel on the upper floors was the first to start business. The interior decoration of the ground floor was delayed, so the society did not move in earlier. Over the past month, the construction personnel contracted to build the building have worked day and night, and the interior was finally painted a month ago. The Joint Business Office of the Four Banks (China &amp; South Sea Bank, Industrial Bank of China, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank), the Savings Society Headquarters, the Reserve Treasury Headquarters, the Enterprise Department, the Investigation Department, the Shanghai Real Estate Office, and the West District Branch moved in simultaneously yesterday. Now, all departments have been deployed and business is scheduled to begin today. The Reserve Treasury Shanghai Depot and the Savings Society Shanghai Branch will remain at their original location at 261 Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Branches Add Services</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Branch of the society was originally located on Carter Road. Due to the expansion of business, the original location was not enough. It also moved into the new headquarters of the society yesterday. In order to serve the community, the branch will add the following services starting today: 1. Safe Deposit Boxes: 500 large-scale new-style safe deposit boxes are available for long-term rental to people from all walks of life at preferential rates. 2. Open Deposit: Various valuable securities, stock certificates, etc. can be entrusted for safekeeping, and interest will be collected on time. 3. Sealed Deposit: Agency for safekeeping of various valuables, such as gold and silver utensils, jade, gems, etc. 4. Postal Savings: Convenient for depositors in this city and other cities.</p>
<h3>Patient in Sanatorium</h3>
<p>Abdomen Enlarged Like</p>
<p>Extracted Enormous</p>
<p>The Sino-Western Sanatorium on Xipushi Road in this city suddenly received a strange female patient a few days ago, requesting treatment. The female patient claimed to be Mrs. Fu Qingxiang, 54 years old. Her abdomen was greatly protruding, with a round object larger than a washbasin, with a diameter of two feet. The circular object occupied the area from her neck to her lower abdomen. Dr. Yi Ren Bomen Fuerte performed an autopsy yesterday morning and obtained a round blood ball, which was flat and round, with a circumference larger than a washbasin and a height of half a foot. The outside was a blood-like mucous membrane, like tofu skin, and the contents were unknown. However, it is speculated that it was blood. The doctors at the hospital were also quite surprised. They plan to examine it further. The patient with this strange disease is currently residing in Room 101 of the hospital.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Travel, Hired Car at North Station Encountered Fraud</h3>
<p>Unemployed Chauffeur Steals Car and Items</p>
<p>Police Chief of Zhengtai Railway Tricked</p>
<p>Peng Jixian, the police chief of the Zhengtai Railway in Shanxi, came to Shanghai from Shanxi on official business a few days ago, carrying two quilts, four pieces of luggage, and two leather bags containing documents, seals, and 440 yuan in cash, and one follower, Wang Shaoxian. On the 15th of this month, they took the Pinghu train south. When the train arrived at the North Station, it was already 11:30 p.m. All the passengers on the train scrambled to hire cars to return home. Therefore, in a short time, all the cars of the North Station Xiang Sheng Automobile Company were hired out. When Peng and his attendant carried the luggage out of the station, there were no cars available. While they were hesitating, a chauffeur came forward to solicit business. Peng and others did not know the situation and immediately made a deal, carrying the luggage onto the car and instructing him to drive to Peng's friend's place in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, the chauffeur had bad intentions, deceived them as strangers from another place, and drove the car towards Zhabei. When they reached a secluded place at the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Oujia Road, the car suddenly stopped. Peng and others immediately asked what was happening. The chauffeur claimed that the car's internal wheels were locked and could not move, and needed to be repaired. He instructed Peng and others to get out of the car, and then took out repair tools from under the seat cushion. Peng and others believed him and immediately got out of the car. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the car abandoned Peng and others and drove south. Peng and others were shocked and wanted to shout, but to no avail. Fortunately, they could still remember the car's license plate number, which was black plate number 2270. They quickly sought help from a friend who worked at the Municipal Security Office and submitted a petition to the Municipal Government requesting an investigation and arrest. The Municipal Government approved the petition and ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to instruct the North Station Branch and Detective Captain Lu Ying to strictly investigate in different directions. After several hours of investigation, it was learned that the car belonged to a certain construction business in Yiding Village on Yidingpan Road. On the evening of the 15th, it had been parked in front of the Carlton Cinema and stolen by Cao Amao and Zhang Changsheng, unemployed locals who used to be chauffeurs. After succeeding, they sent the stolen goods to Zhu Liansheng's place at 4 Huaxingfang on North Zhejiang Road for hiding and then abandoned the car at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road and fled. The Hongkou Patrol then discovered the car and returned it to the original owner. Liang Fuchu, the director of the North Station Branch, Detective Captain Lu Ying, squad leader You Hanwen, and Shen Shoufu, after learning the details, quietly went to Huaxingfang and arrested Zhu Liansheng and Cao Amao together, recovering the stolen goods. They also learned that Zhang Changsheng was hiding at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, so they sent detectives to arrest him in one fell swoop, and took the team to detain him temporarily. After Captain Lu interrogated them once yesterday morning, the criminals all confessed. Cao Amao, Zhu Liansheng, and Zhang Changsheng were prepared to be sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for legal action. Peng Jixian was notified to retrieve the original items. It was fortunate to have recovered them. However, the North Station is a place where people from all walks of life gather, and countless passengers and pedestrians come and go every day. There is often a group of petty criminals who take the opportunity to deceive travelers, known as [kerosene box carriers]. Although the Railway Bureau has sent police to pay close attention, they become complacent over time, and fraud cases occur from time to time. Even with rickshaws, there is often a group of ragged beggars colluding with rickshaw pullers, scattered at the entrances and exits of the station, hiring cars for customers, raising fares, and profiting from it. When these people see out-of-towners, they harass them endlessly and take the opportunity to steal. It is hoped that the police authorities of both railways will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Schedules Memorial Service for Wen Hong'en</h3>
<p>10:00 a.m. on the 27th</p>
<p>Address: Public Stadium</p>
<p>After the former Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hong'en, passed away due to illness, the Bureau immediately began preparations to hold a memorial service for Wen. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., a preparatory meeting was held in the conference room of the Bureau's Secretariat, attended by Secretary-General Sun Pu, Secretary Li Mu, Section Chief Lin of the First Section, Section Chief Hong of the Second Section, Inspector General Tan Baoshou, and more than ten others. The meeting discussed and decided to hold a memorial service at the Public Stadium at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th of this month, and the funeral will be held at the same time. However, the ceremony will be simplified. Wen's coffin will be temporarily placed in a certain place in Jiangwan and will be buried in the Huxi Police Cemetery when it is completed at a later date.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in the City Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Inbound and Outbound River and Sea Vessels Not Affected</p>
<p>Starting at 8:00 p.m. the night before yesterday, a heavy fog rose and gradually intensified. Between 11:00 p.m. that night and 3:00 a.m. this morning, the entire city was shrouded in thick fog. It was difficult to distinguish anything beyond a dozen feet, and the street lights also appeared dim. Therefore, the cars driving on the roads did not dare to accelerate recklessly. The fog began to dissipate until 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-West planes were delayed by 1 hour and 50 minutes due to the fog. However, the inbound and outbound river and sea vessels were not affected. The Xing Shi Wheel from Sanbei arrived in Shanghai on time.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Cigarette Paper Using Postal Parcels</h3>
<p>- Cracked Down in Suzhou Creek Yesterday -</p>
<p>Recently, this city has discovered that a few unscrupulous merchants have been using postal parcels to transport smuggled artificial silk and cigarette paper, affecting tax revenue, which is a matter of great importance. The investigation agencies in this city have repeatedly cracked down on this practice, as reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Suzhou Creek No. 2 patrol boat of the Unified Tax Inspection Office discovered several postal parcels containing a large number of smuggled cigarette papers. It is said that they were first transported from this city to Suzhou and then transferred to Xiaoyi Town in Henan. These people, seeing that the land transportation inspection is very strict and there are many obstacles along the way, have changed to smuggling by waterway, which is more convenient. The tax authorities are now closely investigating the principal offenders and the businesses involved in the shipment and receipt in Shanghai and Henan.</p>
<h3>The Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs Welcomes Liang Tongfang's Release</h3>
<p>Liang Piteously Recounts His Experiences Yesterday</p>
<p>Despite Being Disabled, He Holds No Regrets</p>
<p>The Association for Aiding Patriotic Martyrs of this city convened a welcoming assembly for patriotic martyr Liang Tongfang's release yesterday at 2 PM at its headquarters. Attendees included Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Zhang Xianfang, Fang Peicheng, Wei Langxuan, Wu Huanwen, Yu Yaoqiu, Wang Hesong, Liang Gengshun, and over thirty others. Liang Tongfang was also present. Zhang Xianfang was publicly elected as chairman. It was resolved to convene a representative assembly of various organizations on the 24th to discuss aid measures and other proposals. Details of the proceedings are as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting the Events: After customary formalities, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting. Liang Tongfang then thanked the association for its aid and rescue efforts and reported on his experiences, saying, "Tongfang is originally from Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, currently 25 years old. He studied at Shanghai Vocational Middle School. At the age of sixteen, I entered Jinhe Money Exchange on Fourth Avenue to learn the trade. After the September 18th Incident, seeing the brutality of the Japanese pirates, who killed our compatriots and invaded our country, their cruel and violent acts reached their extreme. I went north to join Ma Zhanshan's army. Soon after, the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out. Also, because Ma's army lacked food and ammunition, making it difficult to continue resisting, I returned to Shanghai and joined the 156th Brigade of the 19th Route Army to fight on the front lines. After the Shanghai Armistice Agreement was established, I followed the Northeast Volunteer Corps for a second time northward, under the command of General Zhu Ziqiao of the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang People's Anti-Japanese Support Association. I participated in resisting the enemy at Jiunmenkou and other places. When Rehe fell, I withdrew to Beiping and was reorganized into the Engineering Training Corps, stationed in Xiyuan. After learning that Commander Weng Zhaoyuan of the 117th Division was killing the enemy in Lulong, the entire Volunteer Corps joined Weng's division. After the Tanggu Truce, we were disbanded again. I went to Zhangjiakou to join Fang Zhenwu's army. By the autumn of that year, I returned to Shanghai. Personally, I found it difficult to make a living, so I made a living by pulling a rickshaw. Seeing the treacherous merchant Feng Qi selling enemy goods, I felt disheartened and attempted suicide once, but failed. Thanks to the assistance of Mr. Tang Haian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, I was sent to study at the Dongya Physical Education School. Later, I learned that Gong Fanglai, who had been paraded through the streets as a traitor, was still using his treacherous merchant tactics, opening the Yuelai Native Goods Store and selling enemy goods, so I went to warn him."</p>
<p>Discussing Assistance: After the report, the following proposals were discussed and resolved: 1. Martyr Liang's wound has not healed and needs to be recuperated. How should this be handled? (Resolved) The Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association will be asked to send him to the Chinese Red Cross for treatment. 2. Martyr Liang is disabled. He should be provided with a good education. (Resolved) The association will find a suitable school and decide later. 3. Martyr Liang was injured for the country and is disabled. How should his family be cared for? (Resolved) Efforts will be made to raise funds to assist them. 4. According to the Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association's request, how should we plan for Martyr Liang's future? (Resolved) Submit this to the representative assembly of various organizations for discussion. 5. Should we request to convene a representative assembly of various organizations on a regular basis? (Resolved) It is set for 2 PM on the 24th of this month (Saturday). 6. How should we commend Lawyer Ma Junshuo for providing pro bono legal defense in Liang's case? (Resolved) Chen Jiufeng will be asked to draft a plan. 7. Patriotic martyrs Yun Huifang, Luo Sizhang, Lu Yong, Zhang Guoxiang, Hong Zhifang, Hua Zhida, Zhu Erkang, Liang Tongfang, etc., should be given commemorative items as souvenirs. (Resolved) The association will prepare commemorative badges and distribute them separately. After the discussions, the meeting adjourned around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Reflections Afterwards: After the meeting, a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency inquired about Liang Tongfang's thoughts on the future. He replied, "I participated in the front lines because of resistance against Japan. This time, I became disabled because I was angered by treacherous merchants. The main purpose is still to resist Japan. Although my body has suffered minor damage, it was voluntary. I think of the Northeast volunteers who died on the battlefield, while Tongfang only injured his arm. What is there to regret? Now that the Shangyu Fellow Villagers Association, the Patriotic Martyrs Support Association, and other organizations are meeting to provide assistance, I am deeply grateful. In the future, even though Tongfang is disabled, I will have no regrets," and so on.</p>

<h3>Bandit Zheng Tangsheng and Others Conspire to Escape from Prison, but Fail</h3>
<p>Bribing Liu Ruiding to Pass Messages</p>
<p>One Accomplice, Li Quangen, Arrested</p>
<p>Huang Yuyi, Deputy Director of the Zhongnan Bank, Chen Yanghe, Assistant Manager of the Siming Bank, He Shaoting, owner of the Xinsenji Construction Factory, Huang Baohua, a wealthy dye merchant, and others were kidnapped and held for ransom in Shanghai from 1929 to the spring of 1933. After the case occurred, the special unit of the French Concession Police arrested the bandits Zheng Tangsheng (local), Shang Zhen (Henan), Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting (both from Yangzhou), Geng Huatang (former adjutant of the Songhu Military Governor's Office, from Jinan), and others in Tianjin in mid-July. After being transferred to Shanghai, it was discovered that these bandits had also committed the kidnapping of Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, compradors of Ewo, in Tianjin, killing and burying them to cover up their crimes. The Tianjin local court was notified, and the bodies of Chen and Liang were exhumed. The French Concession Police transferred Zheng and others to the Second Special District Court to be tried together, and prosecuted them under the Regulations for the Punishment of Aiding Bandits. During the period of final arguments and awaiting judgment, Geng Huatang committed suicide in his cell in the police station out of fear of punishment. Zheng and Shang also made an agreement to commit suicide, but fortunately, the guards discovered them early and sent them to the hospital for treatment. The court sentenced Zheng, Shang, Liu, and Wu to death for jointly and continuously extorting people for ransom. Zheng and the other three refused to accept the verdict and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting a retrial. After reviewing the case files, the Jiangsu Provincial Government returned the case to the Second Special District Court. Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, held several strict trials, and also summoned the victims Huang Yuyi, Chen Yanghe, He Shaoting, etc., to the court to testify. The case is still under investigation. The details have been reported in previous issues. Because the case has not been concluded, Zheng and the other defendants are being held in the heavy criminal section of the Second Special District Court's detention center. Recently, Zheng has been contemplating escaping from prison. He wrote a letter, bribed the guard Liu Ruiding, and asked Liu to send the letter to Li Quangen (31 years old, cigarette factory broker, from Pudong) at No. 16, Renji Road, Pudong, asking Li to secretly prepare firearms and recruit accomplices, and then set a date to carry out the escape. However, the plan was leaked, and the French Concession Police, led by West Inspector Flange (transliteration), arrested Li Quangen at No. 25 Ailege Road the other day and brought him back to the police station. At the same time, Gao Xiaohe, the warden of the court's detention center, was notified and immediately detained the guard Liu Ruiding. Zheng was taken out and briefly interrogated, and then transferred to the Second Special District Prison for strict confinement. The next day, the police transferred Li Quangen to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Qiu Huanying interrogated him. Because the police department's lawyer requested an extension for a thorough investigation of the case, the court questioned the defendant about his age, origin, occupation, and address, and then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and re-examined on the 24th. It is now heard that the police department is sending detectives to investigate the accomplices, and the detention center, after strictly interrogating Zheng and the bribed guard Liu Ruiding, will prepare a document and transfer it to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. Detailed circumstances will be revealed during the next hearing.</p>
<h3>The Latest Style of Pearl Light Lamp</h3>

<p>The Pearl Light Lamp invented by the Shanghai Pearl Light Electric Factory has been warmly welcomed by all walks of life since its introduction. This lamp has a novel style and dazzling light, making it a new invention in modern science. Its advertising effectiveness is ten times greater than that of the New Year's red lantern. This lamp has a strong light and can be adjusted from one to four sides without the disadvantage of front and back. Its size can be customized from one square foot to hundreds of feet, making it suitable for use as a display window decoration or a rooftop sign. The electricity consumption is one-third less than that of the New Year's red lantern. When illuminated, it rotates automatically, with colorful and auspicious light and endless changes. Compared to the dim and unclear running horse style advertising lamps seen on the market today, there is a world of difference. Companies such as Nanyang, Huamei, Yingmei Tobacco Company, Taikang Food Company, China Chemical Industrial Society, and Lianhua Film Company have all ordered in large quantities, which shows its great effectiveness. Because the factory is just opening, it is offering preferential prices to all customers in order to popularize it. It is also learned that the inventor of this lamp is Mr. Lu Yangchun. Mr. Lu studied in Europe and America and has a good understanding of the electrical industry. This lamp was successfully developed after years of research, and its value is immense.

<h3>Sea Bandits Rampant at the Mouth of the Song River</h3>
<p>Water Police Launch Large-Scale Crackdown</p>
<p>Recently, sea bandits have been rampant outside the mouth of the Wu Song River, causing ships to hesitate and coastal fishermen to be robbed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has dispatched the Provincial Water Police Corps to launch a large-scale crackdown. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Team Leader Injured: Yesterday, a certain ship captain told reporters that during the fierce battle with the sea bandits, the firepower was fierce. Because the sea bandits resisted stubbornly, the foot of a certain team leader on our side was hit by a bullet and injured.</p>

<h3>Special Feature</h3>
<h3>A Chapter of the Draft Constitution Regarding the Central Government</h3>
<p>Speaker: Legislator Tao Tuoqian</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai's Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA</p>
<p>Time: November 17th, 7:30 PM</p>
<p>[A Chapter of the Draft Constitution Regarding the Central Government (Chapter Four)] Tonight, Tuoqian accepts the invitation of your association to speak on a chapter of the draft constitution regarding the central government. Constitutional issues are inherently complex, and this chapter is the most difficult to deliberate and regulate in the draft constitution. The entire country is paying close attention, and there is more criticism in the newspapers. The members of the Legislative Yuan, based on the teachings of President Sun Yat-sen, our national conditions, and world trends, have studied each item humbly. The draft has been revised six or seven times to arrive at the final draft. Looking at the provisions of this chapter in general, it is only smooth in wording, comprehensive, and does not have any novelty or special features worth discussing. However, there are a few points that often cause misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, Tuoqian is taking this opportunity to explain these points, which may arouse the interest of the gentlemen present, and I hope you will not hesitate to give your advice.</p>
<p>First point: The theory of the Five-Power Constitution was created by President Sun Yat-sen. There is no precedent in the world. Even President Sun Yat-sen's teachings only stipulate principles. How does this chapter define the spirit of the Five-Power system and the division of political power and governing power? What is the relationship between the various branches? What is the relationship between the various branches and the National Assembly? Are there any factual obstacles? Is the application convenient? Therefore, we cannot simply apply the so-called presidential system or cabinet system of foreign countries in their entirety. Nor can we decide on the method we should adopt solely based on the changes and gains and losses of the central political system since the Republic of China. Our only goal is to formulate a central political system for the Republic of China within the scope of not violating the spirit of President Sun Yat-sen's teachings, so that it can both realize the spirit of the Five-Power separation and adapt to the actual needs of our country.</p>
<p>Second point: The prerequisite question of this chapter is whether the president should also have actual administrative power. On this point, opinions from all sides are divergent and inconsistent. There are strong advocates for adopting a presidential system, and there are also those who favor a cabinet system. In fact, every system has its advantages and disadvantages. There is no system that is absolutely advantageous and without disadvantages. Before solving this problem, first, we must recognize that under the Five-Power system, the phenomenon of the five branches being governing power and forming a confrontation with the legislative branch is completely different. Therefore, the word "cabinet system" cannot be established at all. Second, President Sun Yat-sen once said, "[The administrative leader of the Five-Power Constitution is the President.]" He also said, "[After the constitution is formulated, the people of each county will vote to elect a president to organize the Executive Yuan.]" From this point of view, President Sun Yat-sen advocated that the president should have actual power and that the Executive Yuan should be organized by the president. Third, the trend of world politics is to concentrate administrative power to increase administrative efficiency. Especially in our country, when internal and external troubles are coming one after another, it is not enough to give the president actual administrative power to cope with it. Based on the above three reasons, we decided that the president should always take over administrative power, and the appointment and removal of important personnel in the Executive Yuan should be entirely under the control of the president. At the same time, the president should be responsible to the National Assembly. Therefore, according to the provisions of Chapter Four of the Constitution, the president has two qualifications: first, the qualification of head of state; second, the qualification of being the administrative leader. He also has two kinds of powers: the first is the power of the head of state (Articles 36 to 42), and the second is the power arising from taking over administrative power (Articles 44, 45, 56, 58, 59, and 60). On the surface, it seems to be adopting the presidential system of the United States, but in fact, it is not entirely true. The American president is only responsible to the people, but not to the Congress. Our draft constitution stipulates that the president is responsible to the National Assembly, not vaguely to the people of the whole country. This is the first point of difference. The American president, except for being impeached by the House of Representatives and tried by the Senate for criminal acts, cannot be removed from office before the expiration of his term, even if the president's measures are wrong. The only way is to wait for his term to expire and not re-elect him. Our draft constitution stipulates that the power to dismiss the president rests with the National Assembly, and there are two ways to dismiss him: one is the National Assembly's automatic dismissal, and the other is the result of the National Assembly accepting the Control Yuan's impeachment case and dismissing him. The power to impeach the president belongs to the Control Yuan, and there are also two reasons for impeachment: one is violation of the law, and the other is dereliction of duty. The ways in which the president can be dismissed are more than in the American system, and the scope of impeachment is also broader than in the American system. This is the second point of difference. Now, let's compare it with the German system. The German president has the power to appoint and remove the premier and ministers of the Executive Yuan (Article 53 of the German Constitution). This is the same as what is stipulated in our draft constitution. However, the premier and ministers of the Executive Yuan in Germany must be trusted by the Federal Congress. If one of them is distrusted by a resolution of the Congress, he should resign immediately (Article 54 of the German Constitution). In our country, the premier and the heads of the various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan are only responsible to the president, and the president can freely appoint and remove them, without being restricted by the power of no confidence (Articles 56, 58, and 59). Also, Article 43 of the German Constitution stipulates that the president can be dismissed by a motion of the Federal Congress and a national vote before the expiration of his term. This is not found in the United States and is close to our country's National Assembly's automatic dismissal of the president. However, Germany must go through a national vote, while we have the National Assembly itself that has the final decision-making power, without having to resort to a national vote, so there is no issue of dissolution, which can reduce political turmoil. Also, Article 59 of the German Constitution stipulates that the Federal Congress can accuse the president of violating the constitution or the law to the Supreme Court on behalf of the Federation. Our country stipulates that the president, except for being subject to criminal prosecution for committing internal rebellion or foreign aggression, is only subject to impeachment by the Control Yuan and trial by the National Assembly for other illegal or dereliction of duty (Article 54 and Article 100). It is also significantly different from the German Constitution. Generally speaking, the method of producing the president of our country, the way to dismiss him, the object to whom he is responsible, and the exercise of his powers are mostly different from the current systems of the various republics of the world and cannot be confused. Generally speaking, the governments of various countries mostly focus on the administrative aspect. In our country, the central government is composed of five branches, and the five are governing power organs, which together constitute the entire government. Separately, they independently exercise their powers. Together, they are the entire government. Separately, they independently exercise their powers without infringing on each other. If the president is capable, he can give full play to his skills and abilities within the scope of the powers granted by the constitution to seek the active promotion of national administration, without the worry of being restrained by the parliament. However, if the president relies on his position to violate the law and infringe on power, the National Assembly's dismissal and the Control Yuan's impeachment can be used for sanctions. It is impossible to gather the five powers in one person, leading to the harm of autocracy and dictatorship. This is what we can predict. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Four: A Cup of Water Reveals Hardship, a Poor Worker Protects the Elderly, Vast Sums Can Be Discussed, and Cunning Officials Band Together</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said: "Yes, you probably even asked the tea server to threaten me, right? My surname is Jia." Hu's wife rolled her eyes a couple of times and said with a smile: "Oh, oh, yes, they mentioned it, that they ran into a Mr. Jia on the street once, and they were very grateful to you for sending them back. It's getting dark, and the lights in our house aren't very good, otherwise, I would invite Mr. Jia to sit at our place for a while." Jia Duocai said: "Weren't you about to go out?" Hu's wife said: "Oh! It's already dark, where are we going?" Jia Duocai was very displeased when he heard her completely deny that they were going out. Could it be that Li Shilian's appointment to look at a beautiful woman under the lamp at seven o'clock was to see a ghost? So he sneered: "All of you people are duplicitous. Let me tell you, if you poor people want to take advantage of others, and you have neither knowledge nor ability, you have to rely on others, then you have to show some sincerity. But you're trying to run before you've even learned to walk. You're not only not fooling anyone, but you're making them laugh. I won't say anything now, but I'll see what kind of face you'll have to meet people later." Hu's wife came out to entertain him with good intentions, but he scolded her severely, so she couldn't help but feel anger rising in her heart. She let out a "Hey!" and said: "Mr. Jia, what are you talking about? We haven't offended you in any way, why are you scolding me? Everyone is equal until they need something from someone, and water flows evenly until it runs downhill. We're poor, but as long as we don't steal or take anything from you, what's there to be ashamed of? Isn't that strange? It's true, I asked the tea server at Little Western Paradise to ask you for help, but I didn't get anything from you, so why should I have to bow my head to you?" After all, this Hu's wife was someone who often went out, and after she said these words, Jia Duocai couldn't say anything more, so he flung his sleeves and said: "I'm not going to talk to someone as ignorant as you." After saying that, he turned around and walked into Little Western Paradise. As far as he was concerned, it could be said that he had completely given up on the idea of buying Yueying as a concubine.

<h3>The Sad Cries of a Migratory Goose</h3>
<p>— By Tiannan Ke</p>
<p>Due to the large number and economic prosperity of overseas Chinese, some people actually praise our country as "a weak nation with strong people." In fact, the fact that overseas Chinese have not forgotten their ancestors can still be attributed to the overseas Chinese education that continues despite the dark times.</p>
<p>"A weak nation has no diplomacy" seems to have become an iron law. Now it seems to have advanced to the realm of "weak overseas Chinese have no education." If you don't believe it, please read a letter from a Chinese school teacher living in Siam:</p>
<p>"...I have been in this evergreen country on the Weinan River, accompanying the innocent and carefree overseas Chinese children, for four years. Unexpectedly, the tiny nation of Siam, which is of the same continent and race as us, is becoming more and more ruthless towards us. In the past, Chinese teachers who could speak Siamese but were not familiar with Siamese writing could also get a 'pass.' Now, however, one must have at least four years of Siamese language proficiency to be registered and teach... Last year, they forced Chinese schools to teach Siamese for four hours every day, so we had to secretly teach one hour of Mandarin outside of class. Recently, the Siamese Ministry of Education sent an official document forcing the Chinese school authorities to transfer all Chinese children aged seven to fourteen to Siamese schools for education. Chinese schools are not allowed to take them in. As a result, the children born to the two million overseas Chinese in Siam will have to abandon Chinese and become completely Siamese. They are in the process of eliminating overseas Chinese education within ten years, and it is being carried out vigorously!..."</p>
<p>Chinese people want to read Chinese books but cannot; doesn't that make one extremely angry!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Yi Zhen)</p>
<p>As the weather gets colder, our common people have a smart way to keep warm, which is to "sleeve their hands" (put their fingers inside their sleeves and shrug their shoulders at the same time). This posture is really unsightly, lacking in spirit, and also harmful to one's health. Under the current prevalence of the New Life Movement, I advise my compatriots to get rid of this bad habit first.</p>
<h3>The Crystallization of Love</h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>One day, a certain gentleman ran to my place, with a smile on his face, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Do you know? I already have a lover!"</p>
<p>I looked at his face, meaning to see if his words were mocking me, because not long ago, I had met a lively and beautiful girl, and had said this to him. And now, that girl was gone, and I was annoyed by this matter. I looked at him for a while, and felt that his words were not mocking me, so I said happily:</p>
<p>"Good! I wish you all the best!"</p>
<p>Then he left with a smile.</p>
<p>A few days later, he came to my place again, and a woman came with him. That woman was young and beautiful, with two dimples at the corners of her mouth when she smiled. After his introduction, I knew that she was his lover. I had to be happy for my friend. When they were leaving, he whispered to me:</p>
<p>"I and she are getting married soon. I'll invite you to the wedding then."</p>
<p>I nodded with a smile. Watching them walk away, a sentence suddenly floated into my heart: Where is my lover? She's gone! That day, I felt uncomfortable all day, and I even felt jealous of their affectionate appearance.</p>
<p>After that, they did send me a wedding invitation, inviting me to the wedding, but I didn't go.</p>
<p>This was five months later, when a certain gentleman suddenly arrived. I quickly stood up, shook his hand, and congratulated him and his new wife. The gentleman frowned and said, "Forget it!" Then he pulled me down to sit. He sadly told me:</p>
<p>"Don't even mention her! She lied to me before that she had never been in love with anyone, but only five months after I married her, she gave birth to a child, and even said it was the crystallization of our love; I was so angry that I divorced her."</p>
<p>I looked at him: In his eyes, there were tears of anger and sorrow intertwined.</p>

<h3>One Copper Coin</h3>
<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>The sky was gloomy and dark gray, as if it was about to rain. The five friends in the office stopped all work in order to protect their eyesight. Therefore, a friend named Wang, in this quiet and boring situation, with the consent of most of his friends, began to tell the following story.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a boss of a timber company with more than two million in assets. He had three sons. The eldest son was a bit dull, the second son was more clever, but also liked to eat and was lazy, and the third son was very shrewd. One day, on the morning of New Year's Day, he gave each of his sons a copper coin. The eldest son took the copper coin without saying anything. The second son took the copper coin and thought: Why don't I deposit the copper coin with my father and withdraw the interest every day? So he asked his father to do so. The third son took the copper coin and also wanted to deposit it with his father, with the interest compounding daily, but he did not withdraw the interest, only waiting for the end of the month to settle the account. The father agreed without hesitation. From then on, the second son withdrew interest from his father every day to buy snacks. Time passed quickly, and a month later, the third son came to settle the account with his father. The father picked up the abacus and calculated: One copper coin, with interest compounding daily, one becomes two on the first day, four on the second day, eight on the third day, sixteen on the fourth day... one thousand and twenty-four on the tenth day, one million forty-eight thousand five hundred and seventy-six on the twentieth day, ten million seventy-three thousand seven hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four on the thirtieth day. Taking one dollar as three hundred copper coins, he would need three million five hundred and seventy-nine thousand one hundred and thirty-nine dollars, leaving the father not only giving all his assets to the third son, but also owing his son one million dollars!</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<p>— (Huang Yingdai)</p>
<p>Bees Block Tram</p>
<p>In Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, a tram could not pass because a swarm of bees was gathered on the tracks in the busiest part of the city. No one could think of a solution. Even the police maintaining traffic could not come up with a proper way to drive the bees away, and the tram really had no way to move forward. Coincidentally, a clerk came out of a store and poured a bucket of water on the bees. The bees, getting wet, flew away together and hid in a tree by the side of the road.</p>
<p>The Biggest Cat</p>
<p>Jebson is a London cat, said to be the largest cat in the world, indeed. It has created a new world record. It now weighs thirty-five pounds. This cat has a chest circumference of thirty-five inches, a shoulder width of fourteen inches, a length of thirty-seven inches from head to tail, and each paw is two inches wide. Although it weighs so much, it is as agile as other cats, climbing ladders and jumping on tables with ease. Jebson is indeed no ordinary cat, and its appetite is also considerable, eating a pound of beef every day.</p>
<p>Twenty-Five Year Old Debt</p>
<p>Jeschanis, now the finance committee member in the American Renaissance movement, once owed a newspaper delivery boy five cents for a newspaper twenty-five years ago. Recently, this newspaper delivery boy wrote him a letter mentioning the old debt from twenty-five years ago. Chanis immediately wrote back, enclosing two dimes and five cents of American money as payment, calculated by adding compound interest five times the original debt. This newspaper delivery boy is now also a very wealthy businessman!</p>
<p>First Accident</p>
<p>News from France says that on the island of Ushi Tuo, the first car accident has occurred to this day. The island is five miles long and one and a half miles wide, and there are only two cars on the whole island. Recently, a man named Paul Lucas ran over his cousin while driving a car in a thick fog. This is the first car accident record on that small island.</p>
<p>Woman Who Doesn't Drink Water</p>
<p>Mrs. Minnie Winthrop of New York is eighty-eight years old this year, but has not drunk a drop of water since she was fourteen years old. Counting on one's fingers, it has been seventy-four years. It is indeed a strange thing for a person not to drink water for seventy-four years. It is said that her father died of illness after drinking too much hot water, and since then, she decided not to drink water anymore. As a substitute for water, she usually drinks coffee, whether hot or cold. But at night, she does not drink cold coffee, and sometimes she also drinks milk.</p>
<p>Pigeons Go To School</p>
<p>In a small school in Babila, several elementary school students have one beloved thing! It is a pigeon that goes to school with the children every day. When the children go to school in the morning, this pigeon also follows them to school, even flying into the classroom and hiding on the desk; when class is over, the children go outside, and the pigeon also flies outside; when class starts, the children return to the classroom, and the pigeon flies over immediately. When school is dismissed in the afternoon, the pigeon goes home with the children. On Sundays, when the children do not come to school, the pigeon does not fly over either.</p>
<p>Laziness Can Lead To Divorce</p>
<p>News from Budapest: The Hungarian Supreme Court recently heard a case where a wife requested a divorce because of her husband's laziness and finally won, which also set a new record in divorce cases. This wife said that her husband was a tobacco shop merchant and was too negligent of his business. When she was busy doing housework, her husband would close the shop door and chat with others, so she wanted to file for divorce.</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Floating Record</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because the architecture of the Beijing Imperial Palace is almost exactly the same, and even more winding and complex, we only need to look at the scene at its entrance to understand it.</p>
<p>In the middle of the two side halls where we rested and the main hall where the Empress Dowager lived, there was also a huge courtyard; in this courtyard, there were many lilacs planted, some white and some purple, all blooming luxuriantly. But the smell they emitted was really unbearable: neither fragrant nor foul, just indescribably unpleasant. Smelling it made me feel a terrible headache immediately. Fortunately, its color was particularly elegant and delicate, as lovely as a lightly made-up beauty. According to my personal preference, this kind of flower is much more lovely than peonies and peonies. So I thought that in just one or two more days, I would definitely gradually not find the stench it emits unpleasant because I like its color. Indeed, later I actually got used to it, otherwise, if this stench had invaded my nostrils day and night during the few days we stayed in Fengtian, how could I not have fallen ill? (177)</p>

<p>First Division Will Become Donghua and Western Police's World</p>
<p>The Wallis football team left the Western League First Division with a record of remaining in the First Division by defeating First Division teams. How strong Innes, who came as their replacement, was at one point attracted attention. Therefore, yesterday's match between Innes and Western Police became the focus of interest, as the championship future has a great impact on Donghua, Western Police, and Innes. Unexpectedly, the result at Happy Valley yesterday was that Innes lost to Western Police by a score of one to two. From now on, the undefeated record will belong only to Donghua. Although Western Police lost to Donghua, it was still at the beginning of the league. Now, they defeated French Commercial by a score of five to two, and yesterday they defeated Innes by a score of two to one. It is feared that in the future, the world will be contested by Western Police and Donghua. The First Division standings have changed as follows:</p>

<h3>Yoyo Eliminates Jewish in Skota Cup Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>Luo Haiguang Independently Contributes Three Goals</p>
<p>Five to Two Summarizes the Entire Game</p>
<p>The Yoyo and Jewish Skota Cup preliminary round first ended in a five-to-five draw without a winner. The Western League chose to replay yesterday at Happy Valley. Enemies meeting each other are especially enraged. Therefore, although there were few brilliant plays, the competition was extremely fierce. Yoyo's owner, Cheng Yize, personally went to the field to watch the game. The troops were motivated and did not fail their mission. They finally eliminated Jewish by a score of five to two. The score was two to zero in the first half. Luo Haiguang contributed three goals independently. Mei Hong, Mai Wang, and Nanzhen were energetic and brave, exceeding their past performances. Zhong Yongsen was reassigned to inside forward and provided helpful support. Han Jinshun's shots were inaccurate and missed many opportunities, otherwise the score would not have been limited to this. The center back line was quite dutiful. Wang Shusen was more stable than Jiang Shanjing. Lao Jiang's kicks lacked aim, often exerting all his strength but the ball did not go far and the direction was inaccurate, but he still deserves to be called a brave general. Xu Heng's technique is gradually becoming skilled and will return to its original state. The enemy goalkeeper saved many dangerous shots. Inside back Baldy Hollstein did a good job protecting his goal, surpassing his peers. Center forward Bellinger, right inside forward Pancheck, and left winger S. Greenburg were all good fighters. The entire team's coordination was also good and they ran quickly. It is appropriate that they tied in the first match.</p>
<p>The City Wall is Solid</p>
<p>The two armies formed their formations, and Jewish attacked first. Initially, they felt slightly inconvenienced due to the muddy field, but they became accustomed to it and did not feel troubled. After Jewish took advantage of Yoyo's corner kick failure, they led their army to pursue and kill, with great momentum. The forwards spread out in a line and surrounded them. Fortunately, Little Mustache Yun Fengwu broke out of the encirclement in the midst of the chaos, rescued Adou, and delivered the ball to the front. Yongsen shot from the corner of the goal, but missed. After a while, Haiguang rushed in halfway and passed the ball to Iron Legs. Lao Sun greeted it with his head, but it was blocked by the enemy general. Wang Nanzhen waited under the goal and took advantage of the momentum to add a kick, thinking that it would surely hit the enemy goal, but he was too hasty and shot the ball into the sky. Jewish was then able to advance again and penetrate deep into the camp. Pancheck's shot hit the post, extremely dangerous. Back and forth, neither side achieved anything.</p>
<p>Haiguang Scores in a Row</p>
<p>Yoyo attacked very quickly, but could not score. At twenty-five minutes, Mei Hong really beautifully crossed the ball. Sun Jinshun received it and passed it to Luo Haiguang. Luo darted forward and shot angrily into the goal, opening the scoring. With the victory and defeat separated, the situation became slightly tense. Lao Sun received support from Yongsen and, alone, rushed into the enemy camp, thinking that the enemy goal would be taken soon, but he shot it into the baseball field, causing sighs from the audience. After a short period of intense fighting, Mei Hong stole the ball and passed it over. Wang Nanzhen and Baldy Hollstein headed the ball three times. The ball fell at Haiguang's feet. Unexpectedly, he scored another goal. After this, Wang Nanzhen had a very good side shot at the right corner of the goal, but unfortunately it missed.</p>
<p>Tit for Tat</p>
<p>After resting and fighting again, the situation was even more intense than before. Yoyo vowed to destroy the foreign army, and Jewish tried to retake the city. You snatched from me and I stole from you. Neither side would yield. Wang Nanzhen sent out a corner kick. Haiguang and Yongsen shot twice in front of the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow, but was saved by the goalkeeper. The spectators all praised it. But Yongsen was unwilling to give up, so he dribbled the ball in again, using a feint to lure the enemy, and broke through two levels. He kicked the ball into the goal from about twenty yards away, leveling three cities on flat ground and causing a sensation. Jewish was unwilling to be outdone and launched an even more intense counterattack. The five forwards surrounded and attacked. Bellinger's shot was blocked. Right winger Greenburg scored with one kick, recapturing one of the fortresses.</p>
<p>Scored Two More Goals</p>
<p>At this point, Jewish was quite ambitious and launched a vigorous attack, but Yoyo's defense was tight and full of ambushes, leaving no room for attack. Tan Di was stationed in the Central Plains, and the enemy army was terrified. Little Mustache was the bravest of the three armies, and those who stood in his way were defeated. Lao Sun exerted all his strength, broke out of the foreign camp, and passed the ball to the front because his position was not right to attack the goal. Haiguang received it in front of the goal. The enemy army hesitated to move forward. Haiguang calmly stepped forward and shot, flying into the goal. It was beautiful and delightful. Mei Hong led his troops out of the Xie Valley, bravely taking the lead, luring away the enemy, and reaching the baseline directly. He passed the ball to the center. Lao Sun rushed to the goal, pulled up his foot without thinking, and smashed into the enemy goal, thus firmly taking the victory with a score of five to one.</p>
<p>Groping in the Dark</p>
<p>At this point, the entire Jewish army was angry. The five forwards charged east and west. It was difficult to find an opportunity in the urgency. At times, dark clouds gathered, the sky was dim, and only shadows of people moving faintly could be seen. The ball could not be seen. Both sides groped in the dark, not knowing what to say. In an instant, Pancheck led his troops to the Yoyo hinterland. Xu Heng came to the door to kill the ball and fell into the enemy's trick. Bellinger also rushed to the goal, but before he could turn around, he knocked the ball backwards with his heel, knocking it into the net, resulting in a score of five to two.</p>

<h3>Chinese Football Game Suspended Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Donghua B vs. Hygiene's Western League Game Also Postponed</p>
<p>The Chinese Football Association had four games scheduled for yesterday, but due to the wind and rain, all the fields were unusable, resulting in all the games being unplayed. In addition, the Shin Park Donghua B vs. Hygiene Western League Group C game was also not held.</p>
<h3>1934-35 Men's Basketball Rule Changes (Continued)</h3>
<p>Announced by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation</p>
<p>Chapter VII, Article 9: Add the words "in their front court." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When two players from opposing teams each hold the ball with one or both hands and cannot release it, or when a player holding the ball in their front court cannot move due to tight defense from the opponent and shows no sign of attacking, a "jump ball" should be declared.</p>
<p>Article 9 is revised, but there are no changes to the definition and interpretation of "traveling." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A player moving the ball in any direction beyond the prescribed limits is considered "traveling." The prescribed limits are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) When a player receives the ball while standing still, they may pivot. When pivoting, either foot may be used as the pivot foot.</p>
<p>(B) When a player receives the ball while running or dribbling, they may take two steps to stop or pass the ball. The method of calculating the first step is as follows: if the player receives the ball while standing still on one or both feet, the moment the ball is caught is counted as the first step. If the player receives the ball while both feet are off the ground, the moment one or both feet land simultaneously after receiving the ball is counted as the first step. When one or both feet land simultaneously after the first step, it is counted as the second step. If a player uses the first step to stop, either foot may be used as the pivot foot. If a player uses the second step to stop, only the rear foot may be used as the pivot foot. However, if the feet cannot be distinguished as being in front or behind, one or both feet may be lifted or jumped simultaneously to shoot or pass, but the ball must leave the hand before either lifted foot or both feet land.</p>
<p>(C) After a player receives the ball while standing still or legally establishes a pivot foot after holding the ball, they may lift or jump off their pivot foot to shoot or pass, but the ball must leave the hand before one or both feet land simultaneously. After a player receives the ball while standing still or legally establishes a pivot foot after holding the ball, they do not need to jump or lift their pivot foot before dribbling.</p>
<p>Chapter VIII, Article 1: Delete the last sentence, "The above-mentioned game time should not be changed unless there are special reasons." It is assumed that the game should be conducted entirely according to the above regulations. However, if special circumstances require changes to the game time, the referee has full authority to resolve the matter according to the provisions of Chapter VI, Article A.</p>
<p>Article 2: The penalties for delaying the start of the game have been changed. The text is as follows: If the referee has ordered the start of the game and any team fails to appear on the field within one minute, a technical foul should be called for each minute of delay. If the delay is due to unavoidable circumstances, the referee should grant appropriate leniency.</p>
<p>Chapter IX, Article 3: Delete the words "with the consent of the supervisor" at the end of the section. Add two new sentences as follows: In championship competitions, the team that first scores two points should be declared the winner in the event of a tie. In other competitions, it can also be resolved in the same way with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p>Chapter X, Article 1 (Referee's Note): Add a new sentence after: The purpose of the above rules is to make the ruling of the ball clear to the entire court, not to delay the game to wait for the defending team to prepare.</p>
<p>Chapter XI, "Time-Out," Article 1, Paragraph 4, Section 2 has been significantly changed. The full text is as follows: 2. Other fouls are counted from the time the foul occurs: (A) until the ball leaves the hand when tossed for a center jump (referring to a successful free throw); (B) until the ball is missed (i.e., the ball touches the backboard or bounces off the rim) (referring to an unsuccessful free throw).</p>
<p>Chapter XIV, Article 10 (Note): Delete the six words "the designated opponent." The full text is as follows: If an official calls this violation, the ball should be immediately handed to the official if it is still in the hands of the violator.</p>
<p>Chapter XV is divided into three sections: A, B, and C. Section B is established for the conduct of instructors, providing officials with a more specific method of enforcing the rules. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(B) Conduct of Instructors, Article 7: During the game, instructors shall not coach players or communicate with players. Article 8: During the game, instructors shall not communicate with officials or engage in other expressive behaviors.</p>
<p>(Note): In Articles 7 and 8, the one-minute time-out period is considered the same as during the game. Anyone in the player's area or anyone related to the team who violates the circumstances described in Articles 7 and 8 shall be considered an instructor.</p>
<p>Penalty: Officials should penalize the captain of the violating team with a technical foul. If the above-mentioned violation continues to occur, the official should order the offending party to leave the field. If they do not comply, the team may be declared to have forfeited the game. (End)</p>

<h3>2nd Shanghai-Hua Long-Distance Race: Wang Zheng Lin Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Total Distance of 20,000 Meters</p>
<p>Drizzle and Congested Roads</p>
<p>Time: 1 Hour, 7 Minutes, 54 and 1/5 Seconds</p>
<p>The 2nd Shanghai-Hua round-trip long-distance race, organized by the Xiguang Cross-Country Team, was held yesterday morning at 8:00 AM in drizzling rain. Originally, 108 people registered to participate, but only 94 people actually reported at the time. Crowds of spectators lined the roads to witness these heroes speeding like the wind. As a result of the competition, veteran Wang Zheng Lin won first place with a time of 1 hour, 7 minutes, 54 and 1/5 seconds. Jin Zhong Kang took second place, and Shao Ya Jun took first place in the member group with a time of 1 hour, 15 minutes, 33 seconds. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Start: Before 8:00 AM, all the racers had gathered in front of Minli Middle School. Last year's champion, Lan Shi Jie, did not participate because of the upcoming Jiangda cross-country race. A total of 94 people actually reported, lining up at the starting line in the slanting wind and rain, waiting for the start. At the sound of the gun, they all ran forward, like ten thousand crossbows firing in unison, as fast as lightning. The air on Zhonghua Road was extremely tense. The group moved forward along the road towards Xiaoximen, in a mighty wave. At that time, Gao Zhi Fang, a rickshaw puller, and Ye Xiao Qian, a factory foreman, jumped out of the crowd to take the lead. Wang Zheng Lin, Jin Zhong Kang, Zhang Liang, and others were mixed in with the team of heroes. By the time they reached Daxing Street and Lujiabang, the slender Wang Zheng Lin began to show his brilliance, leaving Xu Yan Bo behind and forging ahead, already far ahead of Xie Qiao.</p>
<p>Midway: By Kangqu Road, a light rain suddenly began to fall, and the rural scenery came into view, making people feel invigorated. At that time, Jin Zhong Kang and Wang Zheng Lin put oil on their legs, and Gao Zhi Fang and Wan Jin Sheng followed closely behind, not giving an inch. Zhou Ru Quan was still in high spirits, and his pace and posture were both beautiful. After crossing Rihui Bridge, the general situation seemed to be set. At this time, the slender monkey, Lao Jin, Xu Yan Bo, Zhang Liang, Wan Jin Sheng, Ye Xiao Qian, Zhou Ru Quan, Gao Zhi Fang, Shao Ya, and others sped like the wind, in the misty rain, not hearing commands, only hearing the sound of people and horses moving, geese formations, or fighting to be first and fearing to be last. After reaching Longhua, the halfway referees distributed cards.</p>
<p>Finish: Returning from Longhua, Jin Zhong Kang, who was originally in fourth place, chased up to second, very close to the slender monkey. Fortunately, the slender monkey was confident and remained in the lead, taking first place in a time of 1 hour, 7 minutes, 54 and 1/5 seconds. Jin Zhong Kang was second, and Zhang Liang grabbed third place by one meter. After that, Wan Jin Sheng, Ye Xiao Qian, Zhou Ru Quan, Mao Zhen Hua, and others came in one after another. A total of 66 people completed the entire run to Longhua and back. The rest retired halfway. Wang Yun Long, a small student, also resolutely participated, and all who saw him praised him.</p>
<p>Awards: After the race, Shen Kun Nan gave a speech and presented the awards. The first place in the open group received two silver shields with the inscriptions "Strive for Self-Improvement" from Mayor Wu and "Heavy Responsibility and Far-Reaching" from Li Ting An of the Health Bureau. The second-place winner received a silver shield with the inscription "Strong Field Leader" from the late Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hong En. The third-place winner received a silk banner with the inscription "Agile Foot Ascends First" from Yu Zuo Ting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

The fifth-place winner received a mirror with the inscription "Strive for Strength" from the Morning News. The sixth-place winner received a silver shield with the inscription "Victory Commemoration" from Chen Ji Cheng. In addition to the silk flag from Yousan Underwear Factory for the first place in the association group, the other winning candidates were given a sports jacket donated by the cooperating factory. A total of 22 were originally to be selected, but because the entire trip was very long and difficult to travel back and forth, 13 more were selected, for a total of 35 people, each receiving a medal of honor, which is currently being made and will be distributed after completion.</p>
<p>Route: The long-distance route was temporarily extended yesterday, so the racers had to run to the "208 Mile" marker on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway at Chenjiawan, south of Longhua Pagoda, as the turning point. Therefore, the entire route was 20,000 meters long.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Inspectors and Education Personnel of Min, Yue, and Gui Provinces Await Departure by Ship</h3>
<p>Departing to Xiamen First on the 22nd of this Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered Commissioner Sun Guo Feng, Inspector Dai Xia to inspect colleges and universities above the specialist level and vocational education in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces. At the same time, it has written to Shanghai's famous doctor Pang Jing Zhou to inspect medical schools in Guangdong. It is reported that Inspector Dai set off for Shanghai on the 17th, and has reserved a ship. Commissioner Sun is rushing to prepare a report on his inspection of Shanghai universities and is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 19th. The two gentlemen, Dai and Sun, will probably take the ship on the 22nd (if a ship is expected, they can leave earlier) and go to Xiamen first for inspection. After the inspection in Fujian is completed, they will immediately invite Dr. Pang to Guangdong together. On the 17th, the Ministry of Education also sent orders to the education departments of the three provinces of Min, Yue, and Gui, and to Zhongshan University and Guangdong Guanghua Medical College and Xia Ge Medical College, stating that inspectors have been sent to inspect, and that they should be informed immediately.</p>
<h3>Director Cheng of the Academic Work Consulting Office Talks About the Experience of Going to Shanghai for Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th telegram) Cheng Zhen Ji of the Academic Work Consulting Office, returned from going to Shanghai for negotiations and said that Shanghai is a region of developed industry and commerce in the country, and also a place of talent. He went to consult various opinions and visited vocational introduction organizations that have been in operation for many years. At present, factories need talents. A person from a machine factory sincerely said, "I have been running a machine factory for nearly 30 years, and today's success is very lucky. At present, I urgently need academic talents to assist me, otherwise I will not be able to maintain it for a long time, but the temperament, actions, and knowledge of today's university graduates often make people unwilling to hire them." The fact that most university students are unwilling to endure hardship is indeed true. As for the commercial field, business talents are suitable, and accountants are especially needed. It is a pity that when it comes to business majors, everyone goes to the path of entering the bank, and the bank itself treats trainees who are new to the industry very poorly, which is also not favored by university graduates. Therefore, banks recruit students from outside to enter the industry to do business. Wang Yun Wu of the Commercial Press highly agrees with the consulting office's introduction internship method. In the past, the library recruited 10 graduates to the library every summer for internships, and the results were quite good. Starting next summer, it will cooperate with this office to recruit specialist talents for internships. Liu Zhan En, President of Shanghai University, has always paid the most attention to students' career problems. He Qing Hou of the China Vocational School is an expert in vocational education. He has unique experience and insights on the supply and demand of talents. He will be invited to Beijing this month to discuss and improve the office's business in detail. Zhu Shao Ping of the Global Student Association has also given a lot of help. Several thanks are now given. 1. The consulting office is mistaken for a purely graduate introduction agency. In fact, the purpose of this office is to investigate the national need for talents and the situation of training talents. Vocational introduction for the academic work consulting agency is only one of the jobs. 2. The number of unemployed university students is increasing. If you want to eliminate this phenomenon, job seekers should broaden their horizons and not take government agencies as the only way out. You must know that only factories, shops, and industrial groups can accommodate a large number of talents. 3. Graduates should pay attention to practice at the beginning of their tenure in order to gain experience, not to seek salary. 4. All industrial and commercial organizations should pay attention to talents, break the outdated concepts of the past, and hire graduates for application.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Central University and Nankai University to Establish Research Institutes</h3>

It also instructed Nankai University that the school's proposed change to establish an Economics Research Institute and the merging of the academic departments of the School of Economics and Commerce were approved for filing. However, the regulations should be revised according to the various points opened on another piece of paper and reported to the Ministry for filing.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Institute of Technology Establishes Academic Experimental Radio Station</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications recently consulted the Ministry of Education, stating that the Beiyang Institute of Technology's request to establish an academic experimental radio station has been notified by the Department of Telecommunications of this Ministry to be approved for establishment. Corresponding consultation is requested for reference.</p>

<h3>Discussing Public Dispensary Systems Based on Relief Work in Newly Recovered Bandit Areas of Southern Jiangxi (4)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Mr. Pang Jingzhou, Recorded by Chen Shengbai and Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>First, high-quality anesthetics, such as novocain, are urgently needed, along with pre-packaged ampoules. Second, tonics, like cod liver oil, are commonly used medicines. Speaking of cod liver oil, I have some thoughts. In Shanghai, ordinary bourgeois individuals find it difficult to see any significant effect from cod liver oil, even refined vitamin preparations. However, the situation is different in the bandit and disaster areas of Jiangxi. I observed that disaster-stricken people suffering from nutritional deficiencies immediately showed improvement after taking 200cc of cod liver oil. Their appetite increased rapidly, their spirits lifted, and after a few days of consumption, they could swallow other foods. Considering the value of cod liver oil, priced at about sixteen yuan a box, a little more than ten cents could save a dying person. Those of us living in cities, enjoying a life of comfort, might feel something from this. Next, regarding the employed talent, there were 206 individuals, including doctors who had studied abroad and graduates of formal medical schools, as well as nurses of all levels earning more than twenty yuan in salary. The highest salary for doctors was two to three hundred yuan per month. This also included other medical equipment and miscellaneous expenses. On average, each patient required the equivalent of four dimes of the aforementioned items.</p>
<p>However, I believe the cost of four dimes mentioned above is still uneconomical for large-scale public medical services. Here are a few more reasons why it is uneconomical: First, there are too many urgent and temporary expenses. Second, the cost of medicines has not been adequately studied. Third, short-term projects have many unavoidable expenses and travel costs. Fourth, short-term employment of doctors often involves high salaries. Fifth, the supply of materials is difficult in the interior, and transportation costs are high. Sixth, medical equipment disappears at the end of the project. Seventh, there are too many units. Assuming we had a fixed organization, avoiding unexpected expenses, we could certainly reduce the costs significantly.</p>
<p>Now, let's compile statistics on the four kinds of medical services that specialize in outpatient clinics: Ji Qun, Gao Xing, Chuan Nan, and Guang Chang. This will reveal more economically sound facts.</p>
<p>In total, the four hospitals treated 139,986 patients, spending 27,241 yuan. The average cost per patient was nineteen cents and four mills. Isn't this already a reduction?</p>
<p>If we eliminate the seven reasons for potential savings mentioned above and refer to the drug expenses of the following two hospitals, we can find an even more economical solution.</p>
<p>(A) The emergency infectious disease hospital treated 86,216 patients, with a total drug cost of 3,812 yuan. The average drug cost per patient was four cents and four mills.</p>
<p>(B) Chuan Nan Hospital treated over 40,000 patients, with a total drug cost of 1,590 yuan. The average drug cost per patient was three cents and five mills.</p>
<p>From the statistics of the two hospitals above, we can determine that the average drug cost per person is four cents. From experience, we know that medical fees are generally two-thirds of drug costs. Therefore, the combined medical and drug costs would only be twelve cents per patient. I believe that conducting permanent dispensaries in this way is not difficult. Moreover, according to my calculations, it is already a very respectable medical service. It will certainly not cause a qualified physician to lack interest and disdain to participate.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Pathogenic Protozoa (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>These protozoa, which appear spherical when at rest, are very flexible in their movements because they do not have any outer shell or flesh to fix their physical substance. They can move in any direction, north, south, east, or west, without any obstruction. However, besides these few naked protozoa, most protozoa have some solid material on their exterior or interior, like their skeletons. Some have a layer of hard shell covering the surface of the protoplasm. This shell is a variant of the protoplasm itself, but the hardness is not the same for everyone. It depends on the environment in which the protozoa live and, of course, on the type of protozoa. This outer shell can sometimes become hard or soft, and it can also be changed artificially using chemicals or by changing their food, etc. Sometimes it can even be completely eliminated, turning into a protozoa without an outer shell. Because the protozoa itself can make this type of shell exist or disappear, we can call it a "living shell." The shape of this living shell does not necessarily have to be circular; there are egg shapes, spiral shapes, and many other shapes. Sometimes, we can be surprised by the shape of a protozoan, wondering how it became such a wonderful thing that can move people's aesthetic sensibilities. It is even more amazing that they are made up of only one cell.</p>
<p>Some protozoa, for special reasons, need to protect themselves or go through a stage of reproduction. Protozoa that originally did not have an outer shell can also grow a shell-like thing, but it often wraps the entire body without leaving a hole, so we cannot consider it an outer shell.</p>
<p>Because the outer shells mentioned above vary greatly in shape, they are mostly not just a single layer. Many so-called outer shells have special physiological functions, such as nipple-shaped structures used as suction devices, which are just one of many shapes. There are countless other pointed, long, and round shapes. Besides the living shells mentioned above, many protozoa bodies carry dead, hard substances. These substances are originally excreted by themselves. I call these things dead because they do not change or disappear like the living shells. Therefore, I call the outer shell made of this type of material a "dead shell." This type of dead shell often does not cover the entire protozoa body but often leaves a place where their protoplasm can be extended or seen. However, these types of protozoa do not have pathological effects.</p>
<p>There is still a part of the protozoa that do not have hard or soft shells on the outside and are naked, just like the protozoa without fixed substances. However, their external shape does not change much, nor does it have any changes in length. The reason is that their interior contains objects that support this shape. We often see some protozoa growing single or multiple soft and flexible filaments from their nuclei, like elastic silk cords. These filaments can often penetrate the outside of the protoplasm and help their movements during movement, like oars. These types of things are often used entirely as a kind of holding band. The protozoa body, as mentioned before, is a gelatinous substance. Objects existing within this gelatinous substance inevitably flow along with the movement of the gel and change their position. If there are these band-shaped things, many substances that do not need to move can be supported and held in place by these band-shaped filaments. Therefore, we can find this type of material at the small openings used as the mouth and anus of the protozoa. Their function is to allow them to open and close freely without making the protozoa's actions also have special movements. Their tools sometimes grow temporary feet. When they want to go in a certain direction, a foot grows in that direction. This foot is, of course, a pseudopod. It is just a part of the protoplasm that protrudes. Their body shrinks in the direction of the foot and takes a step forward, just like the protozoa's body contains a certain degree of elasticity. Originally, gelatinous substances certainly have some elasticity, which we all know. The shape of these pseudopods certainly varies among different types of protozoa. Finger-shaped, thread-shaped, and branch-shaped are what we can often see. There are also many pseudopods that have a central column-like structure in the middle, but there are also protozoa that do not extend any feet and move solely through the flow of protoplasm.</p>
<h3>Advocating for Medical Associations in Various Regions to Organize Economic Mutual Aid Among Colleagues</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from Dr. Song Zhongyu, which mainly says:</p>
<p>[I graduated from the Military Medical School. After graduation, because I could not afford to open a practice, I worked as a primary school teacher for several years. Later, I was hired by a certain hospital, with a stated monthly salary of thirty yuan. However, when I arrived at the hospital, they only paid ten yuan. After negotiation, it was increased to fifteen yuan. Because of the hospital's breach of trust, I resolutely resigned and relied on selling articles to maintain my livelihood. However, it was a drop in the bucket and ultimately of no help. Now, everything has been pawned, and I can only ask my colleagues for help] and so on.</p>
<p>After reading it, I felt extremely uncomfortable, and thus I felt that doctors' lives have no security at all! The general public thinks that doctors are always a privileged profession, that doctors are bourgeois, so a few people with insufficient self-cultivation have a psychology of [envy] and [jealousy] towards doctors. It should be known that this observation is wrong. Among doctors, there are also those who have no food to eat and are under environmental pressure to the point of being unable to borrow money. Like Mr. Song, there are more than just one or two. I have received such letters more than once. There are those who are even poorer than Mr. Song. Society only sees one side, and the other side is not seen, so there is such a wrong observation.</p>
<p>Six years ago, when the National Physicians' Association held a meeting in Shanghai, I had a proposal. The content of the proposal was about how to help a group of unemployed, poor, old, sick, and deceased colleagues. My intention was to suggest that members of medical associations in various regions pay a certain fee per person each year, save it up, and use it specifically to help these poor colleagues or the families of deceased colleagues. I named this method [Economic Mutual Aid]. At that time, it was passed and resolved! But it has not been implemented to this day. I think it has long been shelved and become one of the cases that were decided but not implemented! Now, because I saw Mr. Song's letter and thought of my method, I feel that everyone should have compassion, let alone the relationship between colleagues? I still hope that medical associations in various regions will implement my method, which can directly help poor colleagues, give doctors' lives a kind of security, and indirectly reduce the number of people without food to eat in society, isn't that also a way to benefit the people?</p>
<h3>A Record of an Unexpected Dispute</h3>
<p>— Gu Zongwen</p>
<p>Since I resigned from the Suzhou Provincial Hospital in the tenth year of the Republic of China. I came to Shanghai to establish the Shutde Hospital. Time flies. It has been thirteen years in a flash. Although I cannot boast of having made any contribution to society or achieved any results in treatment. But I am confident that I am always cautious in diagnosing and prescribing medicine. I take responsible treatment as my duty to the patient. In the past ten years. Fortunately, there have been no mistakes. This is what all the patients who have been treated by me over the years have seen. Recently, I encountered an unexpected dispute because I bravely treated a stroke patient. Now I will describe the facts at that time in detail below.</p>
<p>At half past one in the afternoon on the 5th of this month. I was diagnosing patients in the hospital when a phone call came. The assistant inquired. According to the caller, his surname was Pan</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>and he lived at 212 East Pu Shi Road. He was suffering from an acute illness. He had collapsed to the ground. Please come to see him as soon as possible. I immediately drove to the clinic. I saw the patient being supported by several people. Sitting on the edge of the bed. In a state of high somnolence. I immediately ordered them to quickly help the patient to lie flat. And keep the head slightly elevated. Ask the waiter what happened. I learned that the patient had been suffering from headaches and dizziness since three days ago. He did not seek medical treatment. Half an hour ago. The disease recurred. I felt severe dizziness. Can't pick it up. Then walked into the bedroom. I felt severe dizziness. Can't pick it up. Then walked into the bedroom. Intending to recuperate. Unexpectedly, he fell to the ground in front of the bed. Suddenly unconscious. After his friends found out. Then hold the heel and jump for about half an hour. The look changed drastically. I called the hospital about half a year ago. I invited a doctor to come and see me. I pressed his pulse. Weak, almost impossible to feel. And breathing also stopped frequently. At that time, I said that the disease was incurable. However, the shop assistants repeatedly begged for treatment. Driven by enthusiasm, I quickly injected him with two injections of coramine, a cardiotonic drug. In order to save him in case. But in the end, he died because the consultation was too late and he could not be rescued. At this time, Pan's wife happened not to be in the store. My assistant charged the store assistants for the consultation and needle fees. But they are not responsible. Because of my consultation, Mr. returned to the hospital first. At that time, I told his friends that if he had economic difficulties, he might as well be considerate and reduce the amount. I really didn't expect Pan's wife to return to the store. Seeing that her husband was dead, she was unwilling to fulfill her obligation to pay for medical expenses. Then he followed the advice of his neighbors. Report to the police station. It is said that the needle I used may have been inappropriate. Or contains toxic substances. Later, after the police sent someone to investigate. The empty bottle of the injection medicine was sent to the forensic doctor for examination. The next day, under the detailed inspection by Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic doctors Wei and Jiang appointed by the court. He believed that Pan Jintao died of an acute illness. The doctor was not at fault. It is the reporters of various newspapers. Take materials from the patient's family. Tell lies. It is said that after the injection, the patient can still shout ah and scare a sound, etc. This is all false rumors. The patient had already lost consciousness. Unable to speak. Then how can you shout again after the injection. This is because Pan's wife knows that she is telling a lie. I was afraid that I would be punished for false accusations. I had to make up this lie in front of the prosecutor. in short. Doctors treat people for illness. I hope to cure it. Not only to gain honor, but also to fulfill one's duty. If unfortunately it cannot be cured. Moreover, we mourn together. Pan suffered from a stroke. And the most severe symptom of a stroke. Named electric shock stroke. When he fell to the ground. If rescued quickly. Or there is still hope. But my friends have no medical knowledge. Instead, hold the heel and jump. The bleeding part of the brain is more damaged. Resulting in being incurable. The blame lies with self-blame. Those who are enlightened can certainly see it. It's just that newcomers and old friends have been coming in recent days. There are several cases of inquiries by letter or telephone. The deep feelings and high righteousness. I am deeply grateful. Therefore, I wrote this record of unexpected disputes. To clarify the truth of the facts. (Unpaid)</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(45) Gastric Ulcer (Part 1)</p>
<p>Q: What is a gastric ulcer?</p>
<p>A: This is a disease in which the surface of the gastric mucosa erodes due to certain reasons.</p>
<p>Q: How does a gastric ulcer occur?</p>
<p>A: Probably because a part of the gastric mucosa suffers from nutritional disorders, resulting in the tissue losing its resistance, and then being destroyed and ulcerated by the digestion of gastric juice. It can also be caused by stomach bleeding, arteriosclerosis, vasoconstriction, anemia, trauma, burns, etc.</p>
<p>Q: Is this disease related to heredity?</p>
<p>A: The possibility of gastric ulcers gradually expanding is indeed related to heredity and constitution.</p>
<p>Q: Where in the stomach mucosa do gastric ulcers occur most frequently?</p>
<p>A: Most frequently in the lesser curvature or pyloric region.</p>
<p>Q: What are the shape and size of the ulcers?</p>
<p>A: They are mostly round or oval, ranging in size from the size of a pea to 10 to 15 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Q: After an ulcer occurs, is there a risk of the stomach wall being damaged?</p>
<p>A: Old ulcers often destroy the muscle layer, reaching the serosa, and even perforating, injuring the peritoneum or nearby organs.</p>
<p>Q: What symptoms do patients experience?</p>
<p>A: Some patients with gastric ulcers do not feel any symptoms at all; they are only discovered by chance during autopsy after death. Common symptoms include obvious gastric symptoms, such as persistent gastric pressure, stomach pain, belching, vomiting, etc. Some people suddenly experience stomach bleeding or acute perforative peritonitis. In short, the inherent symptoms of gastric ulcer are stomach pain combined with stomach bleeding, excessive stomach acid, gastric motility disorders, and occult blood in the stomach, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is the nature of stomach pain during a gastric ulcer?</p>
<p>A: It starts with a chronic feeling of gastric pressure, especially after eating or exercising. This is followed by localized and characteristic severe stomach pain. The pain can be burning, piercing, or cramping, and occurs after eating or one or two hours later. It is especially severe after eating coarse, hard, indigestible foods. The pain is mostly in the epigastric region (hence the common name "heart pain") or radiates to the umbilical region, back, or waist, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is the nature of tenderness during a gastric ulcer?</p>
<p>A: This type of tenderness has a specific location. Sometimes, placing a fingertip on the abdominal surface of the ulcer site will cause pain. There are also painful spots when pressing on the left side of the spine between the tenth and twelfth thoracic vertebrae. There is also a band of skin hypersensitivity within the area of the seventh to ninth thoracic vertebral transverse section.</p>
<p>Q: What are the vomiting conditions?</p>
<p>A: Vomiting is a frequent symptom in gastric ulcer patients, occurring after eating poorly digested foods. Therefore, the food contains food residue and shows a strong acidic reaction. The vomitus contains blood, which is one of the most important symptoms in the diagnosis of gastric ulcer. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Treatment Methods for Fever (8)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>1. Cold Compress on the Forehead</p>
<p>This is the most common method. Wring out a medium-sized towel from cold or ice water, fold it into several layers, and place it on the forehead. Replace it when it warms up. This simple procedure can be used for any feverish patient. This very ordinary method can also reduce headaches in feverish people and calm their minds. It is completely harmless to the patient. One thing to note is that all hydrotherapy methods for reducing fever require the patient to have a cold head and warm feet. If the feet are not warm, put both feet in a basin of hot water.</p>
<p>2. Wet Sheet Wrap</p>
<p>This is a very peaceful and useful method for reducing fever. It is also suitable for very serious illnesses. The method is to fold a wet sheet and wrap the patient's body inside. The part to be wrapped extends from the shoulders to the knees. A large towel can be used for children in the same way. The sheet or towel should be wrung out of cold water (approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit). If the patient's temperature is 104 degrees, change the wet sheet every two hours. If the temperature is 105 degrees, change it every hour. Remove the wet sheet when the temperature drops below 102 degrees. If a person has a long-term fever, the above temperatures can be lowered by one degree, i.e., change the sheet every hour at 104 degrees, every two hours at 103 degrees, and so on. If the wet sheet is still warm when it is time to change it, it is not necessary to change it. If the skin is cold at the beginning, you can first wrap the body in a wet sheet soaked in mustard water (see details below).</p>
<p>If the condition is serious or the patient is very weak, the following method can be used: the patient lies on his back, fold a wet sheet and cover the body from the chest to the thighs and both sides of the body, and cover it with a dry blanket. In this way, you do not need to move the patient when changing the wet sheet. For children and those with easily excitable nerves, the first time you can put the sheet in warm water (approximately 90 degrees) and wring it out to wrap the patient. Each subsequent time, lower the water temperature of the wet sheet by five degrees. In this way, gradually from warm to cold, the patient can avoid being stimulated. Do this until the temperature drops below 103 degrees. If the patient feels cold, more blankets can be added. This wet sheet fever reduction method is of great benefit to feverish patients with nervous disorders and insomnia. If the patient falls asleep, let him sleep and do not change the sheet.</p>
<p>The mustard wet sheet method is to add mustard powder to hot water (105 degrees). Use one tablespoon of mustard powder for every two pounds of water. Mustard is a skin irritant!! It makes the skin red and hot. The method of wrapping the sheet wrung out of mustard water is the same as with a wet sheet, but the outer blanket around the neck should be specially wrapped to prevent the mustard gas from irritating the eyes and nose. After wrapping the patient, check the skin every five minutes to see if it is red. It will take about 20 to 30 minutes for the skin to turn red. Once the skin is red and hot, you can wrap the body in a cold wet sheet. At the end, wash off the mustard powder on the skin with clean water. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Simple Explanation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (29)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>Now we can return to the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis itself! The tissue in the lesion area gradually changes from an air-containing state to an airless state, or a state of atrophy, which is different from ordinary bronchitis. When performing percussion in this area, dull sounds are generally found. However, this state is not uniform; especially in the early stages of the disease, the sound on the affected side is sometimes higher than on the other side, and even tympanic sounds occur. The results obtained from auscultation are nothing more than two types: one is a change in breathing sounds, and the other is the occurrence of rales. At first, the alveolar sounds are relatively weak, rough, and impure; sometimes the inspiration is subtle and weak, while the expiration is sharp and prolonged; or it makes intermittent breathing sounds. When bronchial sounds occur, we can know that the tissue in this area is completely airless; the dull sounds on percussion are also obviously abnormal. The occurrence of rales in this disease is mostly associated with open lesions; it is almost non-existent for closed lesions. Although there are many types of rales, they are mostly moist; dry rales, such as those seen in asthma and other symptoms, such as snoring and whistling, are rarely seen here. The difference between it and bronchitis is: the rales of this disease are generally limited to a local area and are very fixed in daily examinations; bronchitis is scattered and widespread throughout both lungs, especially obvious in the lower lobes. If the disease is progressing, the scope of its rales will also spread along with it. Based on the various situations listed above, we can make a judgment: that is, if a part of the lung has simultaneous changes in percussion sounds, breathing sounds, and the occurrence of rales, without lacking any of these three symptoms; then, there is no doubt that this is an acute invasive change. This can be determined by percussion and auscultation examinations. The patient does not need to describe subjective symptoms, and other examination procedures can be omitted. Readers can therefore understand how important percussion and auscultation are in the diagnosis of this disease! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(24) True Diphtheria (Commonly Known as Diphtheria) (Continued)</p>
<p>In the previous issue (23). I have already explained that true diphtheria can be divided into three types: pharyngeal true diphtheria, nasal cavity true diphtheria, and laryngeal true diphtheria. Although the cause of these two types of true diphtheria is the same, due to the infection and spread of true diphtheria bacilli, the location of their occurrence is different. Therefore, their symptoms also vary accordingly. Now, let's first talk about the symptoms of the three types of true diphtheria in sequence.</p>
<p>1. Pharyngeal True Diphtheria (rachendiphtherie)</p>
<p>When ordinary people generally refer to diphtheria, they mostly mean this type of pharyngeal true diphtheria. Because its local lesions are only in the tonsils and pharynx, it is relatively easy for the patient or the doctor to discover. However, it is often mistaken for tonsillitis, or conversely, this disease is mistaken for tonsillitis. This is because when suffering from tonsillitis, there are also white spots or membranes. In fact, when encountering a suspicious case, a microscope can be used to check for the presence of true diphtheria bacilli. This is a very easy thing to solve. It is also a definite point in the diagnosis of new medicine. I have diagnosed many patients who have already undergone one or two treatments. Some were treated for tonsillitis as true diphtheria. Although they have already been injected with true diphtheria serum, it cannot take effect immediately. On the contrary, the patient loses faith in the serum. Some were treated for true diphtheria as tonsillitis. Repeatedly delaying the time, missing the good opportunity for serum treatment, eventually leading to the inability to save their lives and death. This is truly a wrongful and unjust death. The cause of this unfortunate result. Although it is the direct mistake of the doctor. However, it is also indirectly due to the patient's lack of medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The incubation period of this disease is approximately two to seven days. There are also cases that only require a few hours. His pharyngeal symptoms vary depending on the severity of the disease. In mild cases. It can also be divided into exudative and lacunar types (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, I have recently read the report on the medical and pharmaceutical undertakings in Jiangxi in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Weekly of your newspaper on October 29th of this year, regarding the sluggishness of the Red Cross Society, and I am shocked. Previously, because Mr. Pan Ji of the Health Department requested to borrow and return the house from our society, and his request was not granted, he actually received such an evaluation of being sluggish. In the past, Zilu was happy when he was corrected, and although our society is not as virtuous as Zilu, we ask ourselves to be full of spirit and conscientious in our work (as can be seen from the matter of refusing the request, we are unwilling to follow blindly when encountering things). If there are any mistakes, we will bravely correct them. From now on, we will strive to do our duty within the scope of our society's hospital and redouble our efforts to thank the Weekly for its advice. As for our society having no opinion on Mr. Pan, we recently received an official letter from the Health Department requesting us to send a telegram to our headquarters donating medicines, which our society has already forwarded as requested to provide relief. Our society has always enjoyed a good reputation and has long been admired by the local people. We hope that</p>
<p>Your newspaper will publish this letter in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Weekly to clarify the truth and protect the reputation of the entire society. With kind regards, wishing you peace. The Nanchang Branch of the Red Cross Society of China.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>A Review of China's Domestic and Foreign Markets</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A few months ago, we often heard in the newspapers that the authorities were planning to develop foreign markets and promote export trade. We, the common people who are constantly facing a terrifying deficit, regarded this statement as good news and waited for its manifestation every day. Later, it did manifest itself. At the end of July, the revised export tariff was announced. In the new export tariff, exports were divided into three categories: duty-free, light tax, and increased tax. The duty-free category included more than 20 items such as wine, the light tax category included more than 10 items such as eggs, and the increased tax category included several items such as tobacco beans. According to the authorities, this is a means to encourage exports and a way to revive domestic industries. Although we cannot find the main export commodities in the duty-free section, all that is there are only those secondary commodities; changing the past specific tax system to an ad valorem tax system is considered a light tax; in fact, it is only to avoid unwarranted losses. As for the increased tax, the purpose is probably only to prevent fellow countrymen from not having tobacco to smoke, so it is necessary to increase its export tax rate and prohibit its export. In short, it is indeed very good! We are endlessly grateful. But in early August, the new import tariff was announced. Before the announcement, everyone thought that this revision would have the same meaning as the revised export tax; in other words, it would encourage our country's industries and remedy the past failures in foreign trade, so the export tax was reduced or exempted; and the import tax would inevitably be increased accordingly. Who knew that the result would be somewhat different, but there is no need to say more. But what is the result of developing foreign markets? The exports in August and September of this year actually fell more than last year, and what is the result of opening up the domestic market? The import trade in August and September of this year not only did not increase compared to last year, but actually decreased. Opening up the customs, but imports still decreased. It seems that our country's domestic products already have the natural ability to restrain imported goods in the domestic market. What a gratifying fact that is! But is the fact really like this? Unfortunately, it is the exact opposite. It is only the result of the public's purchasing power being even more depressed than before. And the decline in the public's purchasing power is the result of the bankruptcy of Chinese domestic industries. The authorities [want] and [say] to revive our country's industries, and their intention is commendable; unfortunately, the means used, let alone discussing them, but citing the experience of other countries as our lessons, whether it is Britain, the United States, or Japan, the first step in their development of industries is to reserve their own domestic markets, allowing infant agricultural and industrial products to be the basis for activity. When the infant agricultural and industrial sectors are healthy and strong, they will go out of the customs to compete with the commodities of other countries in the world market. There has never been a case where, before their own industries are sound, they are driven to compete with the strong, and all that exists is only self-esteem. But when will it be corrected? It's just an unknown number!</p>
<p>The unknown number also has its benefits, because I can write articles in the name of developing this unknown number. I am preparing to reflect on the success or failure of this opening policy from the current situation of reviewing the domestic market. What are some of the results? If my article is well received by readers, then can I not also get a fee to buy foreign goods?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>On February 14th of this year, the Shanghai Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun published a statistic on the trade situation in China in recent years. It said: The total value of China's foreign trade in 1932 was more than 337 million yuan, and the total value of domestic trade at that time was only more than 118 million yuan, but by last year, the total value of foreign trade had almost decreased to the level of domestic trade in the 1930s. And domestic trade, well, it's only more than 93 million yuan. The figures for domestic trade are based on what materials, so it is difficult to grasp the degree of accuracy, but from the fact that the import trade and the deficit have been drastically reduced for three years, domestic trade is in extreme decline, which is already an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>To accurately investigate the current situation of the domestic market, Amitabha, we simply have no way to proceed. But in the materials that have no material, we can also use the two points of the domestic exchange market and the commercial bankruptcy phenomenon as the basis to find a fairly clear concept.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the exchange market is an indirect meteorological station for the rise and fall of commerce. If commerce is prosperous, then the degree of currency circulation will inevitably increase, and thus the exchange markets in various places will also become lively. In the opposite situation, then the exchange market will also be quiet. When the exchange market is lively, for example, the commerce in place A is more prosperous than in place B, then the exchange rate of place B against place A will inevitably rise. In the opposite situation, the opposite result will appear. The commerce in various parts of China can be observed with Shanghai as the center of the exchange market in various places. Because the exports and imports of various places have a close relationship with Shanghai. For the sake of easy explanation, we also have to divide North China, Central China, and Huaxian into sections to observe separately.</p>
<p>The domestic exchange rate of Shanghai against North China has been drastically reduced in recent years. And the reduction is greater than in other parts. In the North China part, try to divide the port commercial ports such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, etc., and inland cities such as Beiping, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, etc.</p>
<p>The exchange market of Shanghai against the port commercial ports of North China, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Shanghai had to pay one thousand and seven yuan and eight corners in order to receive one thousand yuan in Tianjin. But in August of this year, Shanghai only needs to pay nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan, and one thousand yuan can be received in Tianjin. To put it more clearly, if a Shanghai merchant wants to buy goods worth one thousand yuan from Tianjin, then in the 20th year of the Republic of China, they had to pay one thousand and seven yuan and eight corners in a Shanghai bank, and the seller in Tianjin could receive the full amount of one thousand yuan. But now, Shanghai merchants only need to remit nine hundred and ninety-eight yuan, and the seller in Tianjin can get a cargo price of one thousand yuan. In other words, the Shanghai-Tianjin exchange rate has fallen from 1007.8 to 998. Superficially, it seems to be just the change in the credit and value of silver dollars, but in fact it is also due to the result of the exchange bills being quiet! If Tianjin and Shanghai are like this, why not other places. For example, in the same period, the Shanghai-Qingdao exchange rate has fallen from 1.002 to 1.000.2; for example, the Shanghai-Yantai exchange rate has fallen from 1.005.6 to 1.000. As for the inland cities? Well, the Shanghai-Beiping exchange rate has also fallen from 1.003.3 to 998; the Shanghai-Taiyuan exchange rate has also fallen from 1.004.1 to 1.000. The Shanghai-Shijiazhuang exchange rate has also fallen from 1.004.8 to 1.000. The Shanghai-Zhangjiakou exchange rate has also fallen from 1.004.7 to 1.000. In short, none of them have not fallen. Or someone spread the rumor that the commercial relations of North China with Shanghai are not really very close, and their important exports and imports are in Tianjin, Dalian and other places. Then very good, let's look at the Zhengzhou-Tianjin exchange rate. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was 1.009.05; this August, it only needs 999.36. To cite other places would only take up more space.</p>
<p>Now let's look at: the situation of Shanghai against the ports in Central China, such as Hankou. Jiujiang. Anqing. Wuhu. Nanchang. Bengbu. Hangzhou. Nanjing, etc. Their commerce has a deeper relationship with Shanghai than other places. Because their only way to enter and exit is almost all in Shanghai, but the exchange market in the past four years has also fallen sharply. For example, the Shanghai-Hangzhou exchange rate; fell from 1.001.5 in the 20th year of the Republic of China to 1.000.5; during the same period, the Shanghai-Beijing exchange rate fell from 1.001 to 1.000.2; the Shanghai-Wuhu exchange rate fell from 1.004.1 to 1.000.2; The Shanghai-Anqing exchange rate fell from 1.004.3 to 1.000.2. The Shanghai-Bengbu exchange rate fell from 1.003.1 to 1.001.5, and the Shanghai-Nanchang exchange rate fell from 1.004.1 to 1.003.9, but the exchange market of Shanghai against Jiujiang has increased instead of decreasing. The exchange rate in the 20th year of the Republic of China was 995.8, but now it requires 1.003.3. What is the reason? That's because Nanchang became the headquarters and camp for suppressing bandits; material enjoyment is hoped to be sent from Shanghai, and Jiujiang is the throat of Nanchang; the import and export of goods must pass through Jiujiang, so the Shanghai-Jiujiang exchange market has risen. In other words, the commercial relationship between Shanghai and Jiujiang has become more lively than before. But only he is like this, and the others have declined, such as Hankou, although there is also the office of the Deputy Commander, but during the same period, it has also changed from 1.006.2 to 1.003.3.</p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the relationship with South China. Well, except for Guangzhou and Qiongzhou, all others have decreased uniformly. The reason for the increase in the former may be explained by military expenditure and financial subsidies, and the latter may be due to the remittances of overseas Chinese and Qiong students in Shanghai. Against Guangzhou, it was 610 in the 20th year of the Republic of China, but this August it increased to 1.002, and against Qiongzhou, it increased sharply from 1.008.6 to 2.012.1. In addition, during the same period, the rate against Shantou fell by 47 yuan and 40 cents; the rate against Fuzhou fell by 11 yuan; the rate against Xiamen fell by 15 yuan and 80 cents.</p>
<p>This kind of change in domestic exchange rate is of course not only the result of commercial relations and the rise and fall of commerce. The political influence of various places and the change in currency credit in various places are also enough to strongly dominate the exchange market. Then very good, we may as well search for other materials to confirm that the commerce in various places is indeed in great decline.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>When commerce is prosperous, stores will not close in large numbers: this is known to everyone. So when a large number of stores close, one cannot but admit that it is due to the decline of commerce. So what is it like now? Unfortunately, a large number of stores are closing down everywhere.</p>
<p>For example, Shanghai, as everyone knows, is the most prosperous area in the country, but in recent years, those who are obsessed with gold and paper have seen the flags of clearance sales flying everywhere, and cannot help but feel the atmosphere of operating with spears. There are still so many pedestrians on the road, but the stores still cannot turn them into their customers and hold up the iron doors they have closed. According to the Mainichi Shimbun on January 22 of this year, more than 300 stores have closed down in Shanghai after the old lunar new year. We only rely on the statistics on the records of business personnel in the Chinese Bank Monthly, Volume 8, Issue 1 to Volume 9, Issue 4. In the first eight months of this year, 53 large firms and villages went bankrupt, and the contingent of defaulting money villages reached more than 9.46 million yuan. In addition to stores, there are also silk factories, banks, and money villages. Silk factories that have stopped work account for four-fifths of the total today. Banks that have closed down include Zhongxing, Overseas Chinese Credit Union, Wuhua, etc., with a total of eight or nine branches and sub-branches. Money villages are even worse. According to the Chinese Bank Monthly, there are only 71 listed this year; but in the first seven months, seven or eight have closed down. The first production area in the country is like this: why should other places be surprised?</p>
<p>According to the Beiping Yishi Daily on April 3, in the first three months of this year, although there were 258 newly established stores, there were also 153 stores that closed down, accounting for about 60% of the newly established ones.</p>
<p>According to the Greater America Evening Post on January 25, 508 stores closed down in Taiyuan, Shanxi last year, with a total capital of about 370,000 yuan. However, as a result, everyone lost 80% of their money. After the Spring Festival this year, according to the Fujian Minbao on March 17, more than 180 stores continued to close down.</p>
<p>Looking at Hankou again, according to the municipal government report, of the 8,000 large stores in the city last year. More than half of them lost money, and as many as 900 closed down. According to the record in the Nan Jing's Real Newspaper on May 1, of the 800 stores in Jiujiang. More than 260 lost money, and 562 have closed down in the past five years; an average of 110 are closed down every year.</p>
<p>As for the Shantou and Chaozhou areas, more than 270 merchants have gone bankrupt in recent years. And this year, there are more than 20 that have closed down and gone bankrupt. (China Daily, October 13)</p>
<p>In short, there is no good scene everywhere. What is the reason for this? Who would not say: Is this a feature of the prosperity of the domestic market!</p>
<p>But when the new import tariff was announced not long ago, Mr. Wanfeng of a certain Shanghai newspaper had an article entitled "The Direction of My Country's Trade Policy" (a commentary in a certain newspaper on September 27), advocating that one of the principles that should be implemented in trade control is to absorb the import of foreign manufactured goods and raw materials, while prohibiting or restricting the import of agricultural products and consumables. It correctly speaks for the true meaning of reducing certain import taxes, which is great in terms of control, but the public cannot afford to appreciate it, so what can be done?</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>We know that the first principle of a rational industrial policy should be effective and possible conditions. In fact, any attempt to only sing high-sounding tunes will not work. Sacrificing the domestic market under the high-sounding tune of developing foreign markets is simply a joke. Since it is a joke, we don't need to talk about it. It's just that the joke has become a reality, which is not a trivial matter. However, since prestige is at stake, one cannot expect the government to change its orders in the morning and evening. My only hope is that this unknown number will be calculated sooner.</p>
<p>In any country, the domestic market is the basic birthplace and basic source of a large national industry, equivalent to the army's large base camp. If the large base camp does not take precautions, but only wants to steal and harass others' camps, there is no one who will not return to a place where they will not be buried. Moreover, the revision of the export tax cannot be said to have the effect of rewarding local products to attack and attack. Moreover, under the long-term trend of entry, and the invasion and sale of goods for production have reached a daily joy, in the last stage of poverty, what glory is there to sing the high-sounding tune of developing foreign markets? If we slightly restrict the import of goods, then my country has an area of more than 4,278,000 square miles. Assuming that each square mile can eliminate 100 yuan of national goods, then the domestic market can increase the trade of 427 million yuan of national goods every year. In other words, so many imported goods can be reduced. Assuming that according to my country's current population of 474.78 million people, if each person can buy one more yuan of national goods every year, that is, to change the one yuan for buying foreign goods to buy national goods, then the national goods trade can increase by more than 447.4 million yuan every year. This increased figure is already close to the amount of the import surplus in my country in recent years. At present, the bankruptcy of the national economy and the decline of the public's purchasing power are the fundamental reasons for the low prices of trade markets. But if the national industry can be relatively developed, this can also be slightly improved accordingly. Although it still contains hidden crises, it seems a bit of a dream to expect to overcome this inherent contradiction at present? Because this unknown number will be even more vague.</p>
<h3>On Agricultural Warehouses and Rural Economies</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the depletion of domestic rural economies, the concentration of capital in cities, and the lack of solutions, calls for aiding rural economies have grown louder. Agricultural warehouses have emerged in response. With the promotion by authorities and the financial support of banks, they have sprung up like a surging tide. However, in today's severely impoverished rural areas, whether the promotion of agricultural warehouses can usher in a new era, and whether agricultural warehouses are sufficient to rescue the endangered rural economy, are indeed worthy of discussion. First, let's briefly describe the history of agricultural warehouses.</p>
<p>The warehouse system is prevalent in Germany, the United States, and Japan. In ancient China, community granaries and charity granaries were also promoted, but they mainly focused on farmers voluntarily storing food. Their principle was based on local self-sufficiency. In the past, when commodity exchange was not significant, not only could a county's agricultural products be relatively self-sufficient, but each household could also store surplus products to guard against famine. Whether based on a village, a clan, or a township, warehouses could be established as long as they were in the same economic position. However, the current situation is entirely different. The intrusion of capitalism and the torrent of commodities have long shattered the local self-sufficient economies based on households, villages, or even counties and provinces. With the destruction of local economies, community granaries and charity granaries, which were based on local economies, naturally collapsed. Today's agricultural warehouses are said to facilitate the flow of agricultural finance and assist in the revival of agricultural operations. At the same time, banks have the opportunity to lend floating capital. Their nature is entirely different from ancient agricultural granaries. Their implementation in China is still relatively new. In May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the first meeting of the Executive Yuan's Rural Revival Committee first resolved that farmers' banks must establish agricultural warehouses in each county. The Ministry of Industry's Agricultural Finance Discussion Committee also drafted a warehouse law, which was forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review by the Executive Yuan, and then ordered the relevant authorities in each province and city to strictly comply. The first article of the ministry's agricultural administrative plan outline for the 22nd year was also the preparation of agricultural warehouses. Soon, the ministry ordered the Central Agricultural Extension Committee to jointly organize the Central Model Warehouse with the Ningbo Agricultural Relief Association. The Jiangsu Farmers' Bank was the first to engage in warehouse business, starting in the 18th year of the Republic of China. By the 21st year, it reported that 33 warehouses had been established, with more than 800 rooms, a storage capacity of 200,000 shi of rice, and loans of more than 673,000 yuan. The Shanxi Provincial Government's agricultural policy plan for the 22nd year included 24 counties. The Hubei Provincial Government also stipulated that it would first trial warehouses in the three counties of Wu, Yang, and Xiang with banks willing to invest in rural areas. Other examples include the Bank of China, which independently established warehouses in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, with particular emphasis on Zhejiang. The bank decided to use 10 million yuan to aid rural areas in Zhejiang. The initial stage was to establish product warehouses in Wuxing, Xiaoshi, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Cixian, Yinxian, Wenzhou, Yongjia, Tonglu, and Jiande in Zhejiang, providing cash to farmers with the lowest interest rates as collateral to promote the revival of agricultural operations in Zhejiang. In addition to establishing warehouses in Qingyang in Jiangyin, Weiting in Suzhou, and Hushu in Jiangning, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank also cooperated with cooperatives and public organizations in Pandian in Wuxing, Qingxi in Pinghu, Xiang'an in Yixing, and Tangshan in Nanjing, or provided loans to these organizations or cooperated with them in running warehouse businesses. Recently, the bank jointly formed the Hunan Agricultural Product Warehouse Loan Group with the Bank of China. Therefore, the development of agricultural warehouses is due to the authorities' promotion first and the banking industry's promotion later. In the near future, they may make even greater contributions.</p>
<p>Although the history of agricultural warehouses is still short, their development has indeed shown a vigorous momentum. However, we can observe the relationship and capacity of agricultural warehouses to the rural economy from this short history and feel that not only is the assertion that agricultural warehouses are sufficient to save rural bankruptcy questionable, but it is simply impossible. The nature of agricultural warehouses is a variant of pawnshops. In China, pawnshops are undoubtedly a kind of officially licensed business with a long history and exceptional development. Their mission is to regulate the finances of the poor. Larger towns and county seats all have pawnshops. They also have separate warehouses for the pawning of agricultural products, which everyone knows. However, in fact, pawnshop warehouses have not only failed to prevent the crisis of the collapse of the rural economy, but their impact is even more pronounced today! The establishment of pawnshop warehouses did not start today. Their history of regulating rural finance predates the obvious collapse of rural areas. However, the symptoms of rural bankruptcy continue to worsen day by day. Pawnshop warehouses are at a loss and cannot save the situation, even if they want to, it is impossible. On the contrary, in today's extremely impoverished rural areas, social figures advocate promoting agricultural warehouses as sufficient to revive rural areas, which is far from reality. The impending bankruptcy of rural areas has other major causes. Although agricultural warehouses are larger in scale than pawnshops, and the interest rates of agricultural warehouses are lower than those of pawnshops, their position is the same in using farmers' agricultural products as collateral to lend cash to farmers. It is entirely superficial to think that the increased flow of cash in rural areas due to the mortgaging of agricultural products can revive rural areas, completely ignoring the source of rural bankruptcy. If farmers can use cash obtained by mortgaging their own property for agricultural purposes, then rural areas would not have to go bankrupt. If every farmer has their own, or even others', agricultural products to mortgage, then rural areas would never have gone bankrupt? The rural bankruptcy we are experiencing today is the bankruptcy of the entire assets of farmers, not the lack of both parties in rural areas receiving agricultural products, or the fact that farmers are sitting on agricultural products but unable to obtain cash flow. We prove from the facts that the more developed the pawnshop warehouse business, the more profound the decline of rural areas. The busiest period for pawnshop warehouses is at the end of the lunar year. At that time, the agricultural work has come to an end, and the capital that was borrowed at the beginning of the agricultural work must be settled within this period. Therefore, they are forced to pawn what is intended as food before the autumn harvest of the following year. Therefore, the cash farmers obtain from mortgaging agricultural products is used to repay the accumulated debts before the mortgage, and it is not that a cash source can be added for use in other production undertakings once the mortgage is made. This is the most important thing to understand. Farmers' economy is constantly revolving around "eating next year's food this year." For example, when spring plowing begins, farmers do not have the ability to plant, so they have to borrow from various sources, and they have already promised the autumn harvest as a guarantee for repaying what they owe in the spring. The prevalence of usury takes advantage of this weakness. Therefore, in fact, farmers need funds before the harvest of agricultural crops, while the supply of cash to rural areas by warehouses and agricultural warehouses is after the harvest of agricultural crops. The nature of the two is completely contrary, how can farmers receive the benefits of the warehouse? The agricultural products received by pawnshop are indispensable food for farmers. Poor farmers even pawn the seeds they intend to use. Because farmers lack funds before the harvest of agricultural crops, once the agricultural crops are harvested, they must be sold off, except for some food. They must repay the debts they have borrowed. Often, they are still afraid of being insufficient, so they still have to pawn in winter. The larger the number of pawns, the more difficult the economic capacity of this farmer, that is, the deeper the extent of "eating next year's food this year." Therefore, the more developed the pawnshop warehouse business, the more impoverished the farmers, and the more acute the decline of rural areas. This is not a good phenomenon! However, pawnshop warehouses and agricultural warehouses do not provide any assistance to the economic flow of farmers. This is an ironclad fact: however, they only provide a considerable guarantee for the price fluctuations of farmers' retained food! Farmers lack cash in winter and do not sell the only food they have, but go to pawn it, just to prevent the rise in agricultural product prices. Because in the past experience, they know that the rice price in early winter is much cheaper than before the new rice comes on the market the following year. This is due to the commercial usury exploiting the farmers' lack of quality and manipulating it. For example, the rice price per stone last winter was around five yuan, but after the early famine this year, it has risen to more than eleven yuan, which is more than double the price of last year. Farmers are not afraid of the loss of price suppression. Moreover, what they pawn is precisely the food prepared for the following year, so they are willing to spend a limited amount of interest and have a considerable prevention against the rise in food prices. This is the original intention of farmers' pawning. Recently, Article 6 of the regulations on agricultural warehouse loans jointly formed by the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank in Hunan stipulated that "farmers who obtain benefits of more than ten yuan due to the warehouse (calculated based on the market price on the date of entry into the warehouse and the selling price, those who redeem it for food are not subject to this restriction) should deposit one-third of it into the bank for savings to prepare for famine, and may not withdraw it unless there is a disaster or special major event. The intention is very good, but the facts tell us that farmers pawn agricultural products precisely because of price fluctuations. Their expectations are only to maintain the current environment, and they are already exhausted. After this restriction, the relationship between this agricultural warehouse and the farmers' economy is even more monotonous. Whether the seed planting plan can succeed does not need to be described, and we await the proof of the facts. The pawnshop was originally a more reliable business for pawning. Since the implementation of agricultural warehouses, pawnshops have been encroached upon due to the higher interest rates of warehouses, and the original business has been suddenly encroached upon, and may be eliminated in the future. In short: agricultural warehouses can only be regarded as a safe agricultural product mortgage loan method for the banking industry, which has not relieved the real rural finance, let alone revive the rural areas. It is really like abandoning the Starry Sea to explore the source of the Yellow River to say that such measures are intended to remedy the rural economy. No wonder the symptoms of rural bankruptcy are getting deeper and deeper. Therefore, the promotion of agricultural warehouses is just an opportunity for banks to increase the outlets for floating capital, which is also the beginning of the decline of pawnshop warehouses. The promotion of the banking industry is still a means to conform to the trend for its own benefit! Is it really a way to connect urban and rural finance?</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Declined Steadily Last Week</h3>
<p>— Rebound Discovered by Saturday —</p>
<p>Last week, from November 12th to 17th, the trend of the Chinese Securities Exchange was mostly in a state of gradual decline. Large investors were exiting, and northern syndicates were also gradually releasing their holdings. What is noteworthy is that No. 78 still had a special interest in 6% bonds, because it had a large long position in 6% bonds and did not want them to fall. Therefore, it increased its occasional purchases, taking 70 yuan as the standard and absorbing as much as possible. The market price relied on it to maintain its strength. It is heard that not many new bonds have been issued for 6% bonds. A little bit of encouragement is easy to raise the price. Those who are good at making money are not wrong. As for the environmental situation, there is still no concrete plan for the Great Unity, and the focus is still on long positions seeking a way out first. In general, the financial sector absorbs spot silver, and the interbank lending rate gradually increases. There is also a large amount of spot silver exports, and people's hearts are not encouraged. The market is sluggish. There are rumors in various provinces, and Nos. 4, 46, and northern syndicates have sold, and the market price rose and then fell, falling by several jiao. On Tuesday, the price fell by another three or four jiao due to continued sales by No. 4 and others. On Wednesday, there were more short-term transactions, and the market was hovering and extremely sluggish. On Thursday, more long positions were released, and the price fell by another half yuan. On Friday, the lending rate rose sharply, and spot silver exports were very large. Except for No. 78, which maintained the 6% bonds, the rest were dominated by selling, and the decline was severe, falling sharply by several jiao to more than one yuan. On Saturday, the decline continued, but then there was a sudden change, and the rebound was extremely strong, surging one yuan during the session, which was a reaction to the fatigue of the past few days. As the delivery is approaching, there will be more volatility, which cannot be ignored. As a result, the market price fell by several jiao to 1.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was 96,870,000 yuan, and 40 shares of stock. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share)</p>
<h3>New Low Price Seen in New York Telephone Stock</h3>
<p>New York Bank reported that the New York stock market was slightly mixed yesterday (the 17th). The most notable thing was that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph continued to fall by more than four yuan to 101.125 yuan due to a large number of sales, breaking the low record for this year. However, at this time, someone maintained it, and it rebounded. New York Gas created a new low price in history, at 22.375 yuan. Aviation stocks were still strong, steel stocks were stable, and railway stocks showed mixed gains and losses. Small exchanges were shaken due to the softness of public utility stocks and scattered sales in various sectors. In the bond market, US government bonds and a few industrial bonds were quite strong, but most corporate bonds were affected by the selling of railway bonds. Chicago corn was extremely strong due to lack of supply, and the miscellaneous grain market rose. The half-day transaction volume was 450,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<h3>Stable Financial and Silver Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the silver market was generally the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate remained at 1.8 jiao due to the export side not stopping its activities. The early and late markets were the same. The trading volume of lending bills was more than 3.6 million in the early market and more than 300,000 in the new transactions. The trading volume in the late market was more than 200,000, and the trading volume in the Small General Assembly was more than 400,000. Only more than 300,000 was heard on the redemption side of the mortgage transaction, with no new transactions. Qianzhuang silver public list collected and settled more than 32 million, and remittances from various routes were more than 400,000. As for bank collection and settlement, it was completely stopped due to the holidays. The market for auxiliary coins was extremely stable. The price of Jiangnan small silver in the early and late markets was 828 yuan, which was still the same as the previous day. There was no trading heard in the early and late markets. The price of Guangdong small silver was 748.5 yuan in the early market, and it rebounded slightly to 748 yuan in the late market. As a result, it only rose by 6 jiao compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 75,000 jiao in the early market and 80,000 jiao in the late market. Copper coins were 318,500 wen, which was also the same as the previous day. The transaction amount was 57,997 strings and 500 wen, totaling 13,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market: US Cotton Lacks Important Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was weak due to the lack of important buyers and the liquidation of long positions. Spot sales were poor. It is heard that spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fell by 2 to 4 pounds per ton. UK cotton futures rose by 2 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the liquidation of long positions and selling by speculators. It is estimated that the price of Pingle fell by 1.5 rupees, and the price of Oomra and White Luo Creek fell by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (telegram on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Foreign Oil in White Tung Oil Futures More Than Spot</h3>
<p>Since the price of tung oil sold by foreign firms in Hankou was 29.6 yuan last month, more than half a month has passed, and there has been no change in the market. This is because the source of supply has not been strong, and the transactions handled by foreign firms are all scattered. Therefore, the price has remained unchanged for nearly two weeks, which is rare in recent years. According to detailed letters from Hankou, the spot price is still 39.6 yuan, but there were 25 tons of transactions in the next month's futures, and the price was slightly cheaper, at 29 yuan. However, a small number of transactions cannot be used as a standard. It is heard that foreign firms are willing to pay 27.68 yuan for futures in January and February, but brokers dare not sell, because they know that futures sales have been high in various production areas in Sichuan and Hunan, such as Changde and Wanxian. In the future, the arrival of goods in Hankou may not be reliable. Therefore, they would rather have a small number of foreign firms' futures oil than be greedy for more. According to the price of foreign oil sold in Wanxian, it is only 26 yuan to Hankou, and the price of the January delivery in Changde is only around 22 yuan. This is the price for delivery in the production area, and it is said that the number of sales has been high. It seems difficult to be cheaper in the future. Recently, Hankou firms have opened incoming passenger goods at 24.45 yuan for Xiangtong and 23.78 yuan for Zhilou. Although it is slightly lower than before, the goods are few and cannot be reduced, so the situation is still stable, and it is difficult to expect a rise or fall for a while. There are more and more new Zhejiang tung oil. The price of Hangzhou firms has fallen to 24.68 yuan per dan delivered to Shanghai, while the price of next month's futures oil is only between 23.45 yuan. Therefore, there are very few spot transactions, and they are not willing to import more.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Chaozhou Brown Sugar Prices Show Signs of Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market became increasingly weak. The association lowered the price of 24 coarse sand white ordinary spot goods by another 5 cents, to 18.4 yuan, with only 20 bags traded. Transshipment goods are tight, and the price is raised by 2 cents to 5.17 yuan, but it was not successful. Dutch red and Taikoo Sugar Factory white sugar both lacked fluctuations. Only the Chaozhou firms opened more than 30 bags of new Chaozhou brown sugar, which was of better quality, at 12.15 yuan. According to a telegram, Shantou has signs of tightening due to the low number of shipments and lack of inventory. However, sales in Shanghai are also low, and it is feared that it will be difficult to have a good time. Jianbang opened dozens of large bags of ice sugar at 21.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Rain River Rice Not Much Opened</h3>
<p>Prices Fell Again by Two or Three Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still more than 30 sources of supply from various gangs, with a total of nearly 5,000 shi. The market color continued to soften, because the continuous rain hindered guests, and the sales floor was deserted. The street was sluggish, causing the prices of various goods to fall. Later, although the guest gang packed their stomachs and the Qingdao gang purchased 500 bags, people's hearts were tired, and they did not recover. However, the situation turned slightly flat. The prices of late rice and thick japonica rice of various gangs, except for high-quality materials that fell by one jiao, the prices of the middle market fell by two or three jiao. The prices of Zao Yangjian were greatly affected by the guest Jian, and they fell by more than one jiao. Only Yin Yuan was still firm.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 27 or 28 ships arrived from various ports in Hebei. The sales of various goods in the market were very sluggish because the sky was overcast and it rained heavily, resulting in few buyers on the market. New japonica rice and various Jian new and old Bai Yuan early thin rice were very sluggish. The prices of high-quality new japonica rice were flat and tired, and the prices of medium and inferior quality rice fell by a jiao. The prices of thin rice also fell by a jiao. The prices of old Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan fell by a jiao, and the prices of various Jian were flat.</p>

<h3>From Pirandello to Pessimism in Literature</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Everyone probably knows that this year's Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the Italian playwright and novelist Pirandello. Regarding this writer, Mr. Jingzhi made a simple and concise introduction in this journal, and specifically stated that he is a writer with a strong pessimistic color.</p>
<p>Pirandello's pessimism and world-weariness are a philosophy of his, and they lie at the root of his plays and works. He believes that life is fundamentally a sea of suffering, a nothingness. What seems real to one person is often false to another. When he laughs, another person is crying. Life is like this, but Pirandello did not provide a solution. He thought there were only two ways: to die or pretend to be dead, or to indulge in fantasy. Although many of Pirandello's comedies show laughter to the audience, that laughter and humor are all based on a desperate life, it is a "humorism" of collective suffering, a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Pirandello's works are a reflection of the desperate and confused spiritual state of society immediately after the war. Although on the one hand, the Italian Futurists were [pursuing optimism], Marinetti once declared: [We want to counterpose the skepticism of pessimism and determinism with creative intuition, free inspiration, and artificial optimism. However, isn't the so-called [artificial optimism] just a forced smile at a sad reality?</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that pessimism permeates modern literature. This pessimism is not new in Pirandello. Since the nineteenth century, European literature has been almost constantly linked to pessimism. The basic theme of literature is the pessimistic consciousness of the individual regarding the instability of social existence. The works of Maupassant and Chekhov portray pessimistic and gloomy colors. Hardy's view of fate and world-weariness is most thoroughly expressed in his works. Andreev, who was pessimistic and desperate about life to the point of [terror and madness], once captivated the reading world.</p>
<p>This pessimism in literature has deepened due to the unprecedented unrest and chaos of modern society, to the point of self-negation. On the one hand, it is from Schopenhauer's pessimism to Nietzsche's [philosophy of power], using the beautiful cloak of the above-mentioned [artificial optimism] to cover up the tattered essence of reality. On the other hand, a small number of loyal writers have reached, from the extreme of doubt, pain, and contemplation, the recognition of a truly healthy society that can give literature joy and pleasant qualities. Gide is a recent example.</p>
<p>To thoroughly sweep away the rust of pessimism from literature, it is only possible in a truly healthy society. Healthy literature will use an optimistic and scientific point of view to solve all the tragic problems in world literature. The problem of death in the past literature has caused so much mourning and pessimistic sighs, and doubts and despair about life. Death is naturally the misfortune of the dead and the source of deep sorrow for the living. But in healthy literature, even death is not so pessimistic. As Gilbodin said: [Death in struggle—rational death in the cause of promoting the happiness of all mankind—has become a definite symbol of life in the new literature, a symbol of the increasing efforts to complete the best organization of life.]</p>
<p>What we need is this kind of healthy optimism literature. We do not need Pirandello's pessimism.</p>
<h3>Journey (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The situation in the countryside is no different than before.</p>
<p>No, there are differences, my eyes tell me, they say look: that large courtyard, why are so few people living inside, why are the courtyard walls leaning, the houses collapsing and no one repairing them!! Do you understand this reason? Don't you see the wasteland lying uncultivated and no one planting it!! Don't you understand this reason? Aren't there several villages and towns that used to be bustling with activity, with many shops large and small? Now there isn't a single one left, what is the reason for this?………</p>
<p>Just then, a passenger named Wang interrupted this scene with his words, and I had no choice but to put aside my thoughts and listen to them. He said:</p>
<p>[Boss, which inn are we staying at?]</p>
<p>The boss is the driver.</p>
<p>[Which inn is there? There are only two. Let's stay at Sister Zhang's.]</p>
<p>[Sister Zhang's place has been cleaner lately.]</p>
<p>[Sister Zhang's inn is more attentive.]</p>
<p>The man with more than a hundred dollars in his pocket added.</p>
<p>Sister Zhang? That's right, now that they mention it, I had really forgotten about this female innkeeper. Three or four years ago, when I was walking along this road, I stayed at her inn several times. At that time, because she was very dirty and the inn was also unclean, people called her "Dirty Zhang." This name makes me remember her again now. She is a widow in her thirties, which is perhaps the main reason why the drivers did not mind the dirt and still stayed there in the past. At that time, the inn's business was indeed good.</p>
<p>What made her most popular was her unrestrained and casual conversation. The inn guests would make jokes about her, and she never got angry. In fact, she became everyone's "Sister Zhang," and people would call her that whenever they saw her.</p>
<p>In my mind's eye, I envision Sister Zhang: of medium height, wearing dirty blue cloth clothes. Her hair is messy, and even though she has a bun on top of her head, it can't hold it in place. Two large eyes, round and lively, dart about in her rosy face. Only her rosy cheeks are clean, only her eyes are captivating.</p>
<p>She is able to keep the inn cleaner now, I heard Mr. Zhang say, and I feel a little happy, so this must be an improvement in Sister Zhang's management. Sister Zhang is truly admirable. We're almost there, let's see Sister Zhang, whom I haven't seen in three or four years. My eagerness to see her is greater than the speed of the carriage.</p>
<p>For some reason, I couldn't help but ask the driver:</p>
<p>[Is Sister Zhang still alone?]</p>
<p>[There are four people now.]</p>
<p>[Did she go astray, or did she bring someone in?]</p>
<p>[She didn't go astray, and she didn't bring anyone in. It's just that her son married a wife, and the wife gave birth to a son, -- isn't that four people?]</p>
<p>[Ah, that's how it is. Then doesn't she also have a daughter?]</p>
<p>I remember her family.</p>
<p>[She ran away with someone the year before last.]</p>
<p>The son married a wife, and the daughter ran away with a man. Sister Zhang can be considered to have fulfilled her obligations as a mother. A widow, running the household alone, running an inn, is so rare in the countryside! But I have indeed heard people slander this capable woman. Such phenomena are unavoidable in pre-modern society.</p>
<p>We arrived at the inn at more than nine o'clock. This small town is not as bustling as it used to be. There are not many houses on both sides of the street with lights on, and I don't know where the shops have all gone. Half of the houses on the street have collapsed. The driver told me that they were burned by bandits.</p>
<p>The inn used to be ten rooms in a row, but now it has shrunk to five rooms. However, it still seems very spacious, because there are too few inn guests, only about ten people in total.</p>
<p>I remembered what the driver said, and Sister Zhang's daughter; a country girl, daring to elope with someone, it cannot be said that the times have not changed her. Therefore, I found all the answers to the questions my eyes asked me on the carriage.</p>
<p>When the female innkeeper walked into the room to greet us, she was so shockingly different from the Sister Zhang of yesteryear that three words were enough to describe her: she was old. Yet it has only been three or four years. If the driver hadn't been joking with her, I wouldn't have believed that she was the mother-in-law I once had the opportunity to have. Speaking of which, this is also a reason why I easily remembered her, remembered her daughter's origins.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, our family moved to the provincial capital and stayed at her inn for the night. I was seventeen years old at the time, studying in middle school. She told my mother that because she thought I would be successful in the future, she was willing to marry her daughter to me as my wife, without requiring any dowry, but my mother refused. I remember that the good girl was one year younger than me and quite interesting. The next day on the road, my mother told the people in the carriage about this, and everyone sighed over the matter. (What about me?!! I didn't think about it at all at that time.) My mother's reason for refusing was because she ran an inn and already had some bad reputation, and it wasn't worth damaging the family's reputation because of her.</p>
<p>This female innkeeper did not recognize me. When I mentioned the old story to her after dinner, she thought about it carefully, and felt a little like things were not what they used to be. However, when I asked her what her attitude was towards her daughter, her carefree and almost optimistic demeanor surprised me very much. She said:</p>
<p>[Times change year by year, can you blame young people for not playing new tricks? Running away, marrying is not the same thing.]</p>
<p>Later, she told me that business had been declining year after year, and the number of guests had been decreasing year by year. That was why she rented out the other five rooms, in order to earn more rent. She said that it was really difficult to make a living.</p>
<p>I saw some wrinkles on her forehead, each wrinkle was an experience of hers, a mark of her struggle for life.</p>
<p>[An admirable woman.]</p>
<p>But she is despised by people in society.</p>
<p>After she left, I lay down, intending to relive my old dream of three or four years ago in this small inn. No, until early the next morning, the old dream still did not return to my sleep. (The End)</p>
<h3>Thief Cat</h3>
<p>— Written by Horita Shoichi, translated by Gao Ming</p>
<p>As usual, I sat at my desk early in the morning, but I couldn't write a single line. I was just feeling restless and smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>At this time, a little cat, having lost its way, wandered into my house. It was a beautiful calico cat; the son of a thief cat. The little cat purred, cautiously guarding its surroundings. This was not the first time I had seen it. I had wanted to capture it somehow before, but it always escaped. Today I must……!! I carefully reached out to beckon it, making clicking sounds with my tongue, while thinking: [Is there a good way?]</p>
<p>Then, taking advantage of its inattention, I suddenly stood up and shouted [Hey!], slamming the paper door shut. The little cat had originally wanted to change direction and run away like lightning: but was finally trapped in the four-and-a-half-mat (note) room. Because of anger and fear, it raised all the hairs on its body, its small eyes shining like a fierce beast!! Seeing this, even though the little cat was small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, it was simply reminiscent of a tiger. No, no matter how small it was, it was still a fierce beast. It growled at me as I approached, beckoning, showing that it was about to bite, and finally burrowed into the small gap behind the bookshelf. Only then did I feel a little relieved, thinking: It won't be long before I can get it used to me! And I went to the kitchen and got a bowl of rice sprinkled with dried bonito flakes and placed it next to the bookshelf.</p>
<p>But the little cat just wouldn't come out; finally, it was night. Seeing that there had been no sound for so long, I became a little worried, so I moved the bookshelf and peered into the gap; at this time, the little cat was still shining its golden eyes, growling. I pushed the small bowl in front of the cat's nose, but it scratched me. The long claw marks looked red and swollen, and a stream of blood flowed out. As I watched this, I muttered, [Good, good, you cute little fellow! You cute little fellow!] I don't know why, but I felt unusually happy inside.</p>
<p>The little cat, just like that, didn't take a step out from behind the bookshelf until the next morning. When I looked in the morning, the rice was still untouched.</p>
<p>Around noon, I ran to R's place; I didn't come back until evening. In my heart, I was happily thinking: A little cat is now in my house where I live alone.</p>
<p>But the little cat was gone. Two corners of the paper door were torn; the paper door and paper window were covered with claw marks. And the rice in the bowl that it hadn't even glanced at was eaten completely.</p>
<p>I felt very happy that this little cat didn't even wag its tail at me, and in the end, after eating everything in the bowl, ran away. It is said that cats that have been feral cats and thief cats for two or three generations will never be tamed by humans.</p>
<p>I think you can definitely understand why I am telling you such trivial things, right? The awesomeness of a thief cat is completely in line with my wishes. That was the day before yesterday! (To A, K)</p>
<p>(Note) In Japan, [tatami mats] are used to calculate the size of a room. One tatami mat is 3 by 6 square feet.</p>
<h3>Auction</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Wanderer (10)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>[Ai!!] He sighed deeply. [Conscience is in the dice cup. In the dice cup! Haha……]</p>
<p>The two laughed heartily for no reason. Hot tears flowed like a stream down his hairy cheeks.</p>
<p>[Conscience! That is... tsk, have you ever seen it?]</p>
<p>His head looked as if it were not growing on his neck, but rather like a rock placed on a wooden post. He was drunk.</p>
<p>[No one has ever seen it,] he pounded his still bare chest with his fist. [Conscience. That is, everyone has it... Drink... um, if you don't forget: I'm a big bad guy, you know. Don't hide it from you, I'm a liar; a con man who has been around for thirty years, how can there not be one as bad as a leech?]</p>
<p>[Anyway, it's all the same.]</p>
<p>[Good, you drink... Wine, is really priceless, then, if you don't drink, you will [never know the taste of people in this life. Haha...]</p>
<p>He tilted his head back, and the dim moonlight shone through the skylight, scattering on his gray face, and the water streaks of tears shimmered. His eyes widened. In an instant, that hairy and wet, sinewy face did not contain any sadness; he was no longer a declining, ugly and cowardly old man, nor a heartless con artist, but rather a great man, as if he were walking into the colorful sunset. The most brilliant and dazzling page of life covered him, like a religious martyr.</p>
<p>[Let me tell you,] he lowered his head again, rubbing his crooked nose, [thirty years, how did I get through thirty years of scams? This!] He patted his wine pot belly, [It's all this. Without it, dare I think?]</p>
<p>He frowned and took another full cup. He looked like he was about to vomit, and his shoulders surged upwards. Scratching at his temple, he groaned in an unusually aged tone:</p>
<p>[Ai, I'm a bad person, a bad person...]</p>
<p>Apparently, he was completely defeated by the wine. His face was covered by the brim of his hat, and his beard was tied in a gray knot, making it difficult to see the brilliance. His head often tilted to one side, and his chest fanned like a bellows, like a person whose throat had been cut. Suddenly, he stood up and said soberly:</p>
<p>[People! Let it be. Who is born a liar? I sell incense, who doesn't sell it? But aren't they all selling! ... That is, incense cannot cure diseases...]</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Chinese Menu</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Some time ago, due to the seriousness of the unemployment problem of Chinese students, the emergence of the Student Career Movement League caused people in society to sigh: Chinese education has gone bankrupt. Mr. Wu Zhihui came out to explain, saying that we should not just envy others for eating shark fin and sea cucumber banquets. China's current economic situation can only afford [Eight Big Bowls]. But exactly what kind of [Eight Big Bowls] we are eating is not very clear. It was not until the recent publication that we obtained a [Chinese Menu].</p>
<p>According to a report, the Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics comparing the number of students in schools at all levels per 10,000 people in China with those in other countries in the world (24 countries including China). The United States ranks first in universities (73 people), and China ranks last (1 person); Germany ranks first in middle schools (525 people), and China is also at the bottom (11 people) except for Turkey (8 people); Canada ranks first in primary schools (208 people), and China is again at the bottom (236 people). If calculated by the number of people, China ranks 18th in [higher education] and 24th (last) in [primary education], it is said.</p>
<p>In this situation where everything is falling behind, if we can still force ourselves to be content and think of it as an [Eight Big Bowls] banquet, then these [Eight Big Bowls] are by no means dishes for entertaining guests, but can only be said to be green vegetables and radishes. However, vegetables are okay, after all, they can still [nourish], but what is regrettable is that China's appetite is not good, and even green vegetables and radishes cannot be digested, so there is another problem of student unemployment. This morbid phenomenon naturally exposes the unhealthiness of this body. Therefore, some [sage doctors] came out to prescribe remedies and treat it extensively.</p>
<p>People say that on the one hand, we should reduce our diet, and on the other hand, we should administer tonics to enhance digestion. The former method is to use examinations and screening to limit excessive diet, while the latter advocates [production] to improve food and avoid indigestion. However, the result of taking these medicines can only temporarily cover up the phenomenon of [indigestion], but it has not restored the weakness of this body. Although it can make [Eight Big Bowls] [exquisite], it has never been of benefit to this seriously ill body.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not avoid illness and be afraid of treatment, nor should we treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt. Remedial policies will not only not cure the symptoms, but will instead deepen their severity. Obviously, although the symptom of [indigestion] is serious, it is not the root cause of China's weakness. If the root cause of China's illness is cured, the symptoms will naturally gradually disappear. What is the root cause of China's illness? That is, the colonial economy under the imperialist aggression that has suppressed China's development for decades.</p>
<h3>On Catering to Psychology</h3>
<p>— Yan Shi</p>
<p>To [cater to psychology] is such a difficult task, because [people's hearts are as different as their faces], but if you can understand each person's personality and cater to them, then you will inevitably be [smooth sailing] and [successful in everything]. If not, then everything will be tricky and you will run into walls everywhere.</p>
<p>For example: Teachers must understand the psychology of each student and then apply different kinds of training and discipline. Otherwise, not only will the effect be minimal, but there may also be disturbances that will break your rice bowl.</p>
<p>Speaking of commerce, it is especially important. How to make customers happy to buy your things, how to succeed in this transaction, for example: Knowing that Shanghai people like decoration, you must decorate the goods with [gold and jade on the outside], and inside! It doesn't matter if it's [a failure inside].</p>
<p>For example, when talking about family, how to manage your wife, you also have to study your wife's psychology. If her temperament is active, you have to take time out of your busy schedule to accompany her to see movies or travel: If she is quiet, you have to find ways to cater to her preferences, and then you can enjoy happy family happiness; otherwise, there will be small quarrels every three days and big quarrels every five days, which will inevitably be boring!</p>
<p>The above-mentioned examples of [catering to psychology] are only a few, and I am sorry that I cannot list them in detail. However, standing in the current society, you must [cater to psychology] everywhere in order to have food to eat. Alas! I can't help but feel that it is difficult to be a person!</p>

<h3>Reading and Art Apprentices</h3>
<p>— Shi Jingbo</p>
<p>For an art apprentice, reading must be an important part of life. Without reading, it is extremely impossible to succeed as an artistic writer.</p>
<p>Let's look at a few examples.</p>
<p>All the great writers, such as Goethe, Tolstoy, and Turgenev, lived in wealthy classes and received extremely abundant and excellent education. These people's reading is naturally extremely rich.</p>
<p>Even Gorky, who came from the poor class, just look at his two works [My Childhood] and [My Universities], and we can understand how reading has a very important and decisive relationship for him to succeed as the greatest artistic writer.</p>
<p>But this does not mean discarding his extremely rich practical life. On the contrary, reading is an important part of his practical life.</p>
<p>According to Gorky's own recollection, that strict teacher, that cook on the ship, that retired guards platoon leader, that crude, well-read Smolley, who combined beatings and love, and initially guided him and forced him to read, made him truly feel the importance of books, and gradually he also liked to read.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, at that time, Gorky was an art apprentice, and under Smolley's influence, he began to have an extremely close relationship with books; this relationship has been maintained until now.</p>
<p>Secondly, such as the famous French writer Maupassant, when he was an art apprentice, his teacher Flaubert limited him to writing 500-word articles, and strictly revised them again and again.</p>
<p>Even successful writers, as we know, such as Dostoevsky and Chekhov, their reading notes are all constantly working hard, and the notes are piled up day by day.</p>
<p>In our country today, the reading problem of an art apprentice, compared with the above-mentioned people, is indeed closer to Gorky. Not only is it closer, but it is also a typical meaning worth pursuing.</p>
<p>A person who aspires to artistic writing will absolutely not succeed if he follows the existing imperialist system. On the contrary, imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of art. In our country, an enemy as ferocious as imperialism is the remaining force of feudalism. Under the command of imperialism, this force is even more directly and brutally destroying the artistic life of our country.</p>
<p>In fact, anyone who aspires to artistic writing will, sooner or later, be involved in the turmoil of our country's current great era. Therefore, the reading problem of an art apprentice has become more serious, more urgent, and more complicated.</p>
<p>Not only should you read, but you should also read carefully and read every day. Reading is as necessary for an art apprentice as eating.</p>
<p>Reading a lot is indeed necessary for an artistic writer. But for a beginner art apprentice, that is not a true path. Reading a lot is not as effective as selecting a few of the most valuable works and reading, exploring, and researching them deeply.</p>
<p>For an art apprentice, for the most valuable works: First, understand the development of the events; second, observe the characters, conversations, actions, and their environments, etc.; third, explore the artistic expression meaning and writing techniques; and finally, compare several works; even art apprentices can use the materials in their own exercises, and compare whether the author has been successful, and how they should work hard towards the road to success.</p>
<p>Reading for an art apprentice [can deepen his education, broaden his horizons, enrich life experience, increase vocabulary, etc.].</p>
<h3>My Confession</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Now I know that I am a fading, hopeless remnant of wasted time. I often feel heartbroken by the fact that I continue to drag on. It's no different than sending myself to the brink of destruction. Therefore, I want to revive myself properly. Even if I cannot do something extraordinary and earth-shattering in this life, I must at least ensure that I do not fail this existence. It's not that I lack the heart and thoughts to exert myself for life and for others; it's just that the desires in my head remain desires. I always procrastinate, thinking that there is still plenty of time. I put off today's matters until tomorrow, and tomorrow's matters until the day after. Time slips by quickly, and everything piles up day by day, growing higher and higher, until it exceeds what I can manage and becomes impossible to sort out. Desires remain desires, and countless years slip by in between. As a result, my belief in human purpose becomes weaker and diminishes. On the other hand, lazy habits gradually become deeply ingrained.</p>
<p>Looking back is a frequent occurrence, but it is always fleeting. Sometimes, like a repentant saint, standing before the altar of the church leader, I silently confess the sins and arrogance of my life, quietly making a new plea in my heart, hoping to cleanse the stains of my past life from now on. However, when I catch a glimpse of the invisible dust that has accumulated on my back, layer upon thick layer, and the colorful human affairs that are arrayed before my eyes, the enthusiasm that was slowly kindling cannot help but suddenly drop again, returning to a cold, lifeless puddle. I am overwhelmed by the vicissitudes of life, feeling that my strength is insufficient, and so I become despondent once more.</p>
<p>Not just despondent, but also caught by a kind of disillusionment. This disillusionment has more power than despondency to mercilessly destroy my aspirations and my hopes. Disillusionment is more like an endless dark cloud, obscuring the green sky and shadowing my entire thought process, the light and shadow in my whole ideal. So I am like staggering in the long, dark winter night, never seeing the dawn. I cannot see a single star, not a glimmer of light. And that endless dark cloud of disillusionment not only does not dissipate with time, but gradually thickens, over my mind, over my eyes, so that I have almost no aspirations, no hopes, and cannot even muster a trace of interest in life.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the wind blows the clouds apart, slightly blowing away the dark cloud of disillusionment from my mind. It makes my gloomy feeling brighten up a little, but before long, the wind has stopped, and the dark clouds gather again, and the dark cloud of disillusionment spreads its gray wings and swoops down. So my vision also follows the gray, and when the weight of the gray covers higher than my eyes, then I cannot see anything at all.</p>
<p>The result is that I increasingly grasp a certain conviction, and my emotions are like a wild horse running rampant at all times. One minute, I may feel very close to something, and the face that is reflected in my mind is equally beautiful; but maybe in the next minute, it will be completely different, and I may feel that everything is hateful and abhorrent. The faces of everything are ugly and filthy. Even myself I hate. So I almost lose the rational function of ordinary people, and all things can no longer arouse in me a little sympathy or regret. I admit that I am nothing more than a remnant of life, living is no different from dying, and I am a sinner of life, because I have not completed what a person should do, wanting to do but unable to do, and unable to do it. Instead, I am living a life of sin that a person should not live. However, I have decided not to break free from the cross of sin, nor do I want anyone to break free for me. Let me keep carrying it until the last day, and then the charges will be over…</p>
<h3>Fresh Stimulation</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Smoking a "Fadaer" cigarette, I stepped out of the latticed door. The purple dusk dominated this alley. A wisp of blue smoke slowly rose from my lips, which tasted of pre-rain freshness. In the still air, I didn't even dare to throw my leather shoes down heavily. These subtle moral concepts are often hung in my consciousness. I put the rubber tip to the corner of my mouth, humming the guitar interlude of "Fishing Light Song" in my nostrils, humbly. I sauntered to the mouth of the alley.</p>
<p>The tram of the fifth route, with its bright white front, swept past, adorned with sapphire earrings. The trailers were packed with heads of men and women wearing black hats, melon-skin caps, and smelly hair buns. Sparks of cigarette ash were thrown from the windows from time to time, disappearing in a whirl around the iron wheels. Rickshaws always pulled along the tram tracks, and agile passengers often flung down the footboards, shouting loudly, "Pig Luo, don't you want your life!" I wonder whose life he was so worried about? If he weren't sitting in the rickshaw himself, he wouldn't care if the rickshaw and the rickshaw puller were knocked over, right?</p>
<p>The strange eyes of the night city, red, green. The white light of the reflectors was reflected on that thigh. The evil smile of a gentleman, brandy spilled all over the ground, the masterpiece of the advertising artist, hooking the hearts of the young people of this end of the century out of their depression and immersing them in fresh stimulation.</p>
<p>However, I was still trapped by vague consciousness, standing blankly at the mouth of the alley. I had originally planned to go find a friend to chat at home. But I couldn't think of whose house to go to. The close friends almost always hung out together every night. Those few roads from the hotel to the bathhouse, from the club to the cafe, were so familiar that I would know the first day that a new clerk had come to a shop. Strong alcohol, strong coffee, lotus showers, and songstress's voices like tearing silk, were a bit boring now. What used to be considered fresh stimulation was now as disgusting as the advertising reports on the radio and the muddy roads on rainy days. "Where to go?"...</p>
<p>Friends further away? Going there might surprise them. A solitary night wanderer, breaking into the honeyed evening gatherings of other people's families for no reason, would be cursed behind their backs by virtuous housewives. To a relative's house? Oh! That's even more impossible. I'm afraid of the serious, moralistic eyes of the elders. Every ordinary movement would be monitored and restricted, and I would completely lose my freedom of movement there. Why did I come out? Doesn't my home have the fragrance of pre-rain tea, the softness of the sot, the ease of thread-bound books, and the kind lines on my mother's forehead? Can these vulgar, obscene advertising posters compare to the ink wash of lakeside landscapes in that guest room? I thought in my heart while walking along the streets lined with fruit and snack stalls. A look of frustration. When the third "Fadaer" cigarette butt was thrown away, these repetitive thoughts were also thrown away.</p>
<p>The so-called fresh stimulation at the end of the century, apart from the enjoyment of eroticism and lust, there is nothing else.</p>
<p>I lit the fourth "Fadaer" in front of the cigarette shop on the corner.</p>
<p>When I got home, there was a pomelo and a bag of chestnuts. I love the tartness of the pomelo and the charred fragrance of the chestnuts. Fresh stimulation, is that it? The solitary man squeezed out of the pile of strong stimulants, guarding this night of a city that is half-crazy and half-dead in the light taste of the "Fadaer", the clear sweetness of the pre-rain, the tartness of the pomelo, and the charred fragrance of the chestnuts.</p>
<h3>Sunset</h3>
<p>— Hui Shi</p>
<p>After a tea party with a few friends, I wandered alone and silently in the autumn fields where the plants were withering.</p>
<p>The blood-red sunset slowly sank, and the demon of the night began to quietly envelop the earth with her black curtain. I prepared to return in the blur. Fortunately, before long, the bright moon slowly rose from a corner of the eastern sky. – The heart that had been hesitant to return could not help but linger over the water-like moonlight.</p>
<p>Spring flowers are indeed delicate and lovely, but the coldness and clarity of the autumn moon are also pleasing to the heart. Look! Under the moonlight, all sounds are quiet, silent, as if immersed in the supreme comfort of love, lying there, lying like death.</p>
<p>Looking around blankly, I saw only the small river in the distance, reflecting the moonlight, like a crystal silver ribbon, going from a vague, vaguely unknowable place, just like human life, the places of coming and going are truly mysterious. Finally, I doubted and remained silent.</p>
<p>And what I thought about were mysterious and difficult-to-answer questions, increasingly containing the absolute truth. The birth and death of all things are only dominated by the two words "mystery." I suddenly felt that I was wandering in the embrace of mystery. – My heart was lost, bewildered, unable to understand myself, full of shame: I just sang a song praising mystery.</p>
<p>The parasol tree by the small river was blown by the evening wind, and some of the withered leaves had broken away from the branches and were dancing uncontrollably, but it was not easy to fall to the ground. At this moment, my heart! It's just like the withered leaves, unable to find a place to land.</p>
<p>As I walked, I pondered deeply, and many incomprehensible questions gathered in my heart, even if I had the intelligence to answer them for myself.</p>
<p>In the deep night, the moon revealed her charm especially, smiling in the sky. This scene, this situation, reminds me of my hometown, which is human nature; and I can't escape the exception. I couldn't help but think of the past, the life of my childhood was too sweet. – The taste of recollection made me sad and dejected, with tears in my heart.</p>
<p>The sleeping bell of the university broke the silence of the night with a "dang, dang." My distracted soul, listening to the peaceful and rhythmic sound, seemed to hear the urging voice of "Return to your hometown... return to your hometown...", calling me. Indeed, I also felt that I was advancing towards the beautiful hometown!</p>
<h3>The Heart of the Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>Strolling on the stone streets of the ancient style, in the dim twilight of late autumn.</p>
<p>The long, broken stone path echoed with my footsteps. Only I, in the vast twilight, listened to the rustling of the ancient trees by the roadside, and sadly regretted this ancient city in the evening wind as I took steps filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>Quietly, I leaned against a stone pillar of a chastity memorial arch. The long barks of stray dogs drifted from front to back.</p>
<p>Why is it that as soon as time steps into the threshold of night, the road is deserted and no one is to be seen?</p>
<p>The waning moon timidly peeked from behind the treetops, while the stars twinkled like children's eyes in the sky. Borrowing these faint glimmers of light, I looked at the peeling walls of the old houses, the aging trees, and the collapsing residences with the heart of an ancient admirer, and couldn't help but sigh softly!</p>
<p>Oh, you decaying ancient city!</p>
<p>The air is also filled with the taste of decay, stirring my heart's nostalgia. But, I think, before time took notice of this city's youth, it must have had a dream of prosperity! And from the ancient roads, crumbling walls, decaying willows, winding streams, or even from the leisurely demeanor of the residents, one can taste its former charm.</p>
<p>But now it is old! Sparse households occupy this not small area. Unless passing through, who would be willing to come here to see its old face?</p>
<p>The city walls wrapped in ivy no longer have battlements, the parapets have also fallen down, the watchtower is only a few broken walls, the city gate has become the home of termites, and cannot be closed. The city, oh, it's more like a desolate graveyard.</p>
<p>I think the ancient city has a soul, crying every night!</p>
<p>The barking of stray dogs came from all directions. I leaned against the chastity memorial arch, and the stone gave me a cold feeling. The stone pillar already showed cracks, as if it was about to fall. I hurried away and continued to stroll on the stone streets of the ancient style.</p>
<p>Why are there so many stone memorial arches! They stand tall everywhere here. Carefully examining the soil marks engraved on the stone arches, they are nothing more than odes to loyalty, filial piety, and chastity. It turns out that this ancient city once had many loyal ministers, filial sons, and virtuous wives. This is perhaps its glory! However, just time has erased its glory, and the people standing under these memorial arches will no longer feel reverence, but rather pity and mockery.</p>
<p>I thought of it, the heart of the ancient city is those stone memorial arches that praise loyalty, filial piety, and chastity. In the past, these stone memorial arches must have flashed with dazzling brilliance, but year after year of wind and rain has tarnished them with gray.</p>
<p>The heart of the ancient city is dead!</p>
<h3>Haircut</h3>
<p>— Shucheng</p>
<p>Whenever I go to the barber shop to get a haircut, my mood is always extremely uneasy. This has almost become a neural pathway, especially recently, as various facts have indicated to me that the environment is constantly stimulating me, and the uneasy component has become more and more complex.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at three o'clock in the afternoon, because I didn't choose that breeding science course, I sat in the study room and randomly flipped through a few pages of the newly published XX magazine, but I didn't feel any interest at all. I looked at Song, who was sitting next to the second window facing south. He had already stood up, propping his chin with his right hand, staring blankly at the cluster of pine trees on the mountaintop across the Sha Lake!</p>
<p>I walked closer to him and patted him on the shoulder a few times, as if he had woken up from a drunken stupor. He touched the few wisps of beard that seemed to be there on his mouth and said to me with a sentimental expression: "Ah Cheng! Shall we go get a haircut?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the barber shop, I sat in my favorite seat facing the window. At this time, the old uneasiness that I felt every time I got a haircut played out like a movie. Scene after scene.</p>
<p>The barber was showing off his skills, constantly using the scissors to cut non-stop, and I silently let him manipulate me!</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, as soon as I saw the barber coming to my house, I either cursed loudly or "ran away!" My mother always said that she would make me a long robe for the New Year and buy me flowered socks, or she would buy a cake in advance to lure me, but the barber's skills were not very good, and he was busy shaving, so he used a heavy hand, which felt a bit painful; sometimes, before he finished shaving, I would run away!</p>
<p>"Oh dear! It hasn't been a few days since you got a haircut, and your beard has grown again! People are really failing!" Ping pushed open the door of the barber shop, stood in front of the mirror, and looked at his face, using a surprised tone as if he had discovered some miracle.</p>
<p>These real feelings are the elements of my various anxieties.</p>
<p>I also have a feeling that every time I get a haircut, I always feel that it seems like only a few hours have passed since the last haircut, and everything I have experienced has not been forgotten at all. I think reflection is best done during a haircut, so I privately regard it as a time for reflection. This is my recent intuition, maybe it's my personal quirk!</p>
<p>I have always hated that time is a monster that slips away. Sentimentality increases with age. Now, only four or five days after a haircut, my beard grows back. The past when I ran away when I saw the barber is just a faint shadow left in a corner of my life history. What else is there?</p>
<p>I left the barber shop and wandered on the road from the dormitory to the study room. I deeply understood what Song meant when he touched his mouth and spoke with a sentimental expression just now.</p>

<h3>Take it!</h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>Although I sympathize with your situation, I find your personality and behavior a bit annoying. You know that your youth is past, and you also know that dedicating yourself to a career is impossible, then you should quickly decide on your future, but you are drunk in the vast ocean of fantasy, I say, you deserve your misery and pain.</p>
<p>When you were swept into the vortex by the torrent of the times, you naturally recognized yourself as a heroic woman with a great future. You did exercises, carried a gun, charged, assaulted, and broke through enemy lines. As an army captain in military uniform, who didn't admire you? Who didn't respect you? Who didn't love you? Who didn't pursue you? However, when you were an army captain in military uniform, you were so ambitious that you didn't take men seriously. At that time, it was naturally smooth sailing. You were not a woman, but a masculine soldier with reason prevailing over emotion. You were able to be a masculine soldier when you wore a military uniform, so when you left military life, you should understand that you are a woman, you should understand that your environment is treating you as a woman, you should naturally be a woman to adapt to your environment, to seek your hope, to do the work that you can do, to live your life. However, you don't. You still think that you are a masculinized, special woman, a superman of the present society. Therefore, you are a monster in the present society, an out-of-date fool, a female hooligan who doesn't fit in with people's eyes. You think that you are a pure, frank, thoughtful and intelligent woman who is ahead of the times. You associate with men as if men associate with men. You think that it is the most reasonable and natural thing for you to interact with men and have relationships; however, you have failed! You are running too far ahead of the times. The people of the present society who are falling behind you are in awe and suspicion, from suspicion to contempt, from contempt to deception. So, you often run into walls, get fooled, disappointed, hurt, and become a lonely person marching alone in the desert, lonely, depressed, troubled, worried, sad, and painful.</p>
<p>You think that past encounters can be dismissed with a smile, but in fact, in this way, you cannot gain the slightest lesson from the experience gained in the past, getting fooled again and again, disappointed again and again, and the future pain will be enough for you to endure. Why are you still drunk in fantasy?</p>
<p>A person who is drunk in fantasy is a person who is dreaming. Do you think that dreams are always sweeter and happier than real life? That's such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>We should face reality and fight against the harsh environment. On the road of life, just like on the battlefield going to the front line, does the person walking on the battlefield going to the front line allow you to be drunk in fantasy? No, if you are not careful, your life is at stake. You are only allowed to look forward with your eyes, listen to the left and right with your ears, and grope forward with your hands and feet! On the road of life, you should walk just like on the battlefield going to the front line.</p>
<p>Do you still think that you can forgive people, and people can forgive you? You are wrong, absolutely wrong. In this competitive society, people's abilities are falsehood and treachery. On the outside, they all look like gentlemen, but in their bones, they are all selfish and self-interested. Do you think that only men are selfish and self-interested? What about women? The environment in the city also forces her to be selfish and self-interested. You should recognize this clearly. The present society is creating selfish and self-interested people, and only selfish and self-interested people can survive in the present society. Regardless of your own happiness, the result of your efforts is just a fool's reward.</p>

Baoyu secretly notices this first, and gently comforts her. Now is the perfect time to enjoy the autumn scenery. After taking medicine, they compete in writing new poems. Look at this. The gauze window forms a natural picture. The silver candlelight in autumn is a superb phrase. If you continue to lie alone in bed, you might be seen and laughed at by Chang'e as foolish. Yingchun and her sisters laugh and say that one should enjoy life while one can. They order Zichang to immediately prepare a small banquet, and the sisters sit down without refusing. The fragrance of rice stalks accompanies the golden cups filled to the brim. Writing flows effortlessly from their brushes. Baoyu is penalized with a golden cup, his pale face already flushed with rouge. He leans on the railing, trying to gaze at the moon in the sky. It is perfectly full and without defect.

They kill each other indiscriminately. Men ride horses, horses trample people. Corpses pile up, terrifying ghosts and gods. Brothers are scattered, fathers and sons separated. The separation of flesh and blood is even more heartbreaking. Only a chorus of crying can be heard, like ants on a hot pan with nowhere to hide, like headless swarms of flies. Where the fire starts, smoke billows. It clings to their bodies, smelling foul, like smoked field chickens, like roasted corpses. There is no way forward, no door behind.

<p>Horns blare at night from the city walls of Luntai, the broom star falls north of Luntai. A military dispatch arrived last night from Quli: The Chanyu is already west of the Jinshan Mountains. From the watchtower, the west looks dark with smoke. Han troops are stationed north of Luntai. The supreme general leads his troops to the west, and the army marches at dawn to the sound of flutes. Drums beat on all sides, and the snow sea surges. The three armies shout, and the Yin Mountains shake. The enemy's military strength is connected like clouds. On the battlefield, white bones are tangled with grass roots. The Sword River wind is sharp, and the clouds are wide. The sand and stones are frozen, and the horses' hooves slip. The assistant prime minister diligently serves the ruler, enduring hardship and bitterness, vowing to quell the border troubles and repay the ruler. Who has not seen this in ancient history? Now, we see achievements surpassing those of the ancients.</p>

The central army sets out wine to drink with the returning guests, accompanied by the huqin, pipa, and Qiang flute. Flurries of snow fall outside the gate, and the wind snaps the red flag, freezing it still. I see you off at the east gate of Luntai, and when you leave, the Tian Shan road is covered with snow; the mountains are far away, and the road turns, I can no longer see you, only horse tracks remain on the snow!</p>

<h3>The Reason Why American Women Look Up to Garbo (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xiliu</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Garbo's greatest allure is based on her dreamy romance, not a realistic one. Therefore, in this respect, she is distinctly different from other movie actresses. Even though they try to imitate her, she is still incomparably unique. Strangely enough, her unique personality, which makes her impossible to imitate, is not in her face, but in her body - the figure with a grown man's flavor, and the swaying way of walking, is something that ordinary women cannot learn. She has no boudoir air. She does not have that娇弱（jiaoruo; delicate and weak), that helplessness, that clinging, that pitiable look. She represents a kind of魄力 (polì; boldness, courage), a spirit of uncompromising in the face of difficulties. This courage, this spirit, is the element of Garbo's fame. Perhaps this is what Maurice Stiller saw, he lifted her from a low, unknown position and created a world-famous superstar. This great director with superhuman magic knew that America was missing a new type of woman to replace the little girls dragging hair curlers, with dimples, acting娇羞(jiāoxiū; shy and coy). He knew that American women already had the impression of liberation and needed a special woman who could be their leader. So when he brought Garbo out, everyone unanimously submitted.</p>
<p>Garbo's appearance on the screen was at a particularly opportune moment. For almost ten years, she has been ruling over women in general. She started the trend of shoulder-length hair, she created many styles of clothes and hats. She advocated women's square shoulders, making daughters dress like football players one by one. She also pointed out to women in general how to wear men's clothing. Garbo herself likes to wear men's trousers, velvet shirts, flats, wide sleeves, etc. when she is not on the screen, and these are now fashionable. But she did not deliberately create styles to be imitated. She was only wearing what she liked the most, what best suited her physique and temperament, and it was unintentionally and naturally imitated by women in general. They worship her and want to learn to be like her, even if it's just in appearance. She is their example of liberation. They admire her independence, they envy her courage. She is the woman ahead of her time.</p>
<p>Garbo always controls a central position in every scene she films. This obvious superior position is what all women admire. However, this special status can also be said to be caused by the isolation of her childhood, which was left behind unintentionally. This may also be the reason why she never seeks love or marriage. According to a famous expert in psychological thought, why does a woman like to wear long pants instead of a woman's long skirt? That is because they like to show outwardly their inner need for a superior position. This expert, Professor Adler, said that such women are endowed with a masculine stubbornness - some are harmed by it, and some are benefited by it. He was also surprised to see the increase in the number of women wearing pants, understanding that many women in the world wish they were men. This ideal has been confirmed in tests in many American schools, in which about 40% of American female students wish they were men. This stubbornness is a manifestation of women's resistance to the presumed inferior status of women. This assumption is deeply planted in their minds from a young age. When they see that their fathers are always more superior, living different, shocking, and lovely lives, the various benefits for men have caused various profound changes in the hearts of women, making women feel a general dissatisfaction with their positions. The education that women receive is to teach them to be able to win the love of men, to make men think they look good. But stubborn women not only oppose pleasing men, but also want to be men themselves. This is the starting point for long pants, men's clothing, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Hot-Blooded Loyalty"</h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Yorck-Shanghai</p>
<p>This is a German film made by Ufa Company under the guidance of the Hitler government. It is also a so-called historical film.</p>
<p>A page of past history will never be accidentally brought to the screen; it will inevitably reflect the views and opinions of the playwright, more or less, especially when it is used as a propaganda tool. Therefore, a historical fragment as far back as 1812, under the Nazi ideology of Hitler, was exhumed from the grave because it could suit the current political situation.</p>
<p>Yorck, the Prussian hero of the 19th century, was resurrected in the 1930s under the guise of Hitler. Isn't it? At that time, he disobeyed the Franco-Prussian alliance and fought against France in the Napoleonic era, while now the梟雄（xiāoxióng; ambitious and unscrupulous leader) with the 卐 （wàn; swastika) emblem wants to abolish all the treaties of the Allied Powers against Germany after the Great War, and re-emerge as a country with a方 （fāng; direction, ambition) for aggression. Of course, on the eve of the Second World War, the struggle for power in Europe, although there was the subservience of the Little Entente countries clinging to the League of Nations as a talisman, she was still Germany's biggest enemy. Of course, from the Disarmament Conference or the struggle for the Saar Basin, we can see Hitler's intentions. In domestic propaganda, the so-called restoration of national freedom has become the best phrase. But we have to ask, under the 卐 （wàn; swastika) Party's regime, is there really a restoration of freedom? Leaving aside the rest, many liberal film writers in Germany, such as 布布斯脫（Bùbùsītuō; Pabst) and his kind, cannot stay in their own country and are exiled. So, where is the so-called freedom? Is it to say that the freedom of the few is the so-called freedom of the nation?</p>
<p>Let's talk about it again. How is the so-called national freedom explained? Originally, what they were seeking was to expand their armaments in order to ensure their victory in the Second World War. Then we believe that the majority of the German people do not need wars of aggression; what they want is to change the current economic organization and, together with the people of the whole world, obtain real freedom in politics and economy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it goes without saying to what extent the playwright's propaganda and proselytizing intentions in ["Hot-Blooded Loyalty"] are distorted. Even in terms of filmmaking techniques, we can hardly believe that this is a production of Ufa, which was once glorious in the past. In a film with war as the background, we have rarely seen it so dull. On the battlefield, we can only listen to the monotonous sound of the bugle lonely, and in the court of William III, it is also so dull.</p>
<p>In this film, the greatest achievement is the heavy performance of the actor who plays Yorck.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My Opinion on [Physical Fitness]</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, this is a film with an incomplete story and拼凑 (pīncòu; piece together) work. Its score is only below [Human Fairy]. Undoubtedly, this exposes the commodification of movies.</p>
<p>Leaving aside reality, let's first talk about the兹点 (zī diǎn; key points) of the content:</p>
<p>The playwright only grabbed some documentary-style subjects here, and he used three absolutely different eras to represent the development of the story. But obviously, the playwright did not fully understand the true situation of each era. He only wrote some superficial social phenomena.</p>
<p>So, on the screen, we only see the struggle between man and nature, the strong physique of women, and the use of power to overcome men, and the simplicity of human life; this is what is called [Primitive Age]. Li Houzhu's玩 (wán; play with) slender waists and small feet, regarding women as men's toys, and oppressing women as much as possible, that is the [Feudal Age]. The so-called general modern women in the present society are willing to be玩弄(wánnòng; play with) by bourgeois men and live an excessively decadent life, damaging their health. Although this suggestion targets the common symptoms of general women nowadays, it cannot hide its exaggerated weakness, that is [Capitalist Age]. I think this shallow and simple view is really wrong.</p>
<p>However, if the playwright took these subjects a step further, then it would not have been a bad object, but unfortunately he did not do it. Especially, he advocated women's sports and also had educational intentions, but the result was counterproductive due to the lack of skill.</p>
<p>The director cannot but bear considerable responsibility for the faults in this film: 1. Several scenes of the primitive age were cut from foreign animal movies. 2. It seems that it should not be appropriate to use the Southeast Sports Teachers' Recreational Association as the majority of [Physical Fitness]. 3. There should not be烫发 (tàng fà; permed hair) guys in the primitive age. This is also the director's disregard for reality.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Li Lili replaced Ying Yin in several swimming scenes, and Ying Yin's movements during morning exercises were also so mechanical. It is already ridiculous to promote [Physical Fitness] with someone who does not meet the conditions of physical fitness. Moreover, the meaning of [Physical Fitness] is definitely not just showing it to the audience. Other so-called more than 200 girls are also insignificant.</p>
<p>The beauty of camera angles, this is But Du Zi's specialty. We can see these little smarts in every one of his works.</p>

<h3>Black-Faced Kindness (Imitation of Life) (1)</h3>
<p>— Wenyin</p>
<p>Produced by American Universal Company, starring Claudette Colbert</p>
<p>Beatrice is busy and happy. Today seems to be a bad day, so everything is unusually uncooperative. She is giving her child a bath, the phone is ringing, and the coffee is burnt. She is already twenty minutes late for work. But that naughty Jessie is still twisting and turning,嘴 （zuǐ; mouth) said: "I don't want to go to that nursery. I want to play at home with my mother." Beatrice sighed and coaxed her: "I'd rather play with you at home too. But I have to go out, what should I do?" Indeed, everything is not easy since her husband passed away. She has to go out to manage her husband's business - odds and ends - to maintain the lives of mother and daughter. But this kind of life is really not easy. She has to go out every day, going door to door to sell sugar and oil. When people refuse, you just have to pretend to smile and walk away. Sometimes, when she thinks about the vastness of the future, she has to muster up the courage to move forward. Years are flowing, and this kind of hardship has already drawn a few lines on Beatrice's beautiful face, adding some dark shadows to her heart. But she always encourages herself, believing that everything is worthwhile and meaningful. As long as she hears her child's laughter, all sacrifices and all pain can be erased. At this time, she thinks of this, so she lowers her head and kisses her child's pink, fragrant neck. The child was tickled by her kiss and drilled straight down, almost falling out of her arms. Beatrice hurriedly shouted: "Baby, don't move, I'll put your clothes on for you!" The phone rang again. Beatrice sighed and helplessly put down the child who was half-dressed, told her to sit on the stool and not move, and ran downstairs to answer the phone.</p>
<p>She ran downstairs, but it wasn't the phone ringing, it was someone ringing the doorbell outside. So she went to open the door. She saw a fat, big black woman standing outside from the screen window, her big face as shiny as polished ebony. Beatrice opened the door and asked her what was the matter. The black woman's eyes begged and said: "Good morning. My name is Delilah. Did you advertise for a black maid? I'm here looking for a job..." Beatrice was confused when she heard this, and she couldn't help but ask: "What main advertisement are you talking about?" The black woman then took out a classified ad cut from a newspaper from her pocket. She said: "This is it...it says...seeking a maid...must be able to cook, wash, and manage the house, preferably black, not afraid of hard work...the salary is not high..." Beatrice shook her head repeatedly when she heard this and said: "You've made a mistake. I didn't post any advertisement." Delilah looked at the ad again and then asked: "Isn't this Astor Road?" Beatrice then suddenly realized that she had missed the road. She said: "You've made a mistake. This is Astor Street. Astor Road is still very far from here, at the other end." She pointed out the door and said, "You can take the tram at the corner of this street." Delilah said: "I have to walk." As she spoke, she wanted to leave. Beatrice looked at her with pity and said! "It's too far to walk...wait a minute, I'll get some money for you to take the bus." Delilah was so grateful when she heard this and said: "You are so kind." As she spoke, she sniffed around and said: "What's burning?" Beatrice was reminded by her words and hurriedly ran to the kitchen, where the coffee had been boiling for a long time...a pot of oatmeal porridge was also burnt. But before she could move the porridge, the child upstairs started crying. Beatrice didn't care about anything and ran upstairs. She had forgotten Jessie for a long time. When she went up and looked, the child was sitting wet in the bathtub. She fell down because she wanted to pick up a toy duck, scaring her to cry. (To be continued)</p>
