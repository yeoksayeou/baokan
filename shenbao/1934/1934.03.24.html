<h3>美日換文前後未進行任何交涉</h3>

<p>美海軍案交羅斯福簽字</p>
<p>菲島獨立案通過美國會</p>
<p>（南京）　外交部息、美日互換非正式函件事、美外部二十一日通電駐外使領、加以說明、茲譯錄如次、「日本外相廣田與美國國務總長赫爾所交換之非正式函件、其原文已於東京及華盛頓報章發布·兩國政府間前此並未嘗進行何種交涉、現在亦並無任何交涉之進行、」（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　海軍省關於廣田赫爾交換文書、昨日以談話之形式發表意見如下、「二十一日各報朝刊載有倫敦電報、謂帝國以排日移民法改訂·「滿洲國」承認·菲律濱獨立爲代償、滿足現行海軍比率、然此係與事實相違、帝國海軍有改訂現行海軍比率之决心、至今並無何等變更」云、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　參議院今日通過五萬萬元海軍擴張經費案、此案現送交總統簽字、三月六日此案即爲參院通過、但增若干附加文、爲衆院所拒絶、兩日前將此案退回參院覆議、今日乃照原案通過、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國最優勢海軍案已爲參衆兩院通過、今日卽送交總統簽字、關於此案之國會行動已告一段落、參院通過附加條文時、反對者對於議會報告之表决阻力横生、然卒歸無效、衆院今晨自通過此案後、卽將該案送交參院、據稱、羅斯福總統不久卽將批准此案、總統以爲此案不特將增强美國之國防、亦且爲數千工人謀工作、文生特拉曼海軍案規定美國海軍建造戰艦一０二艘、飛機一千一百八十四架、參院對此議案之附加文最後亦爲衆院所通過、參院之附加文限制私家公司承造戰艦與飛機者、僅應得百份之十之利益、此舉所以避免外間對於海軍計畫之漁利也、此案對於經費之分配並無特殊之規定、惟今後造艦需用欵項時將由國會隨時核定云、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<h3>外交當局對美日換文觀察</h3>
<p>不致承認爲組織</p>
<p>（南京）　報載美日互換外交公文、各國官塲對此均深切注意、英國某報並稱美國或將承認僞國等情、記者以茲事關係我國至鉅、特往叩某外交當局、據談、美日互換之文件、係屬非正式性質、惟尙未窺見全文、自無從下精確之斷語、但就此時觀察所及、美日換文之動機、或在緩和美日間兩年來之緊張空氣、並無其他作用、證之以美外部分致其駐外使館之通電、謂美日兩國間「前此並未進行何種之交涉、現在亦無任何交涉之進行、」此種視察或非錯誤、至於不承認僞組織之主張、美國政府已一再宣告、爲其一貫之政策、而去年六月七日國聯顧問委員會所通過關於不承認僞國之辦法、亦經美國駐瑞士美公使正式函復國聯秘書長、表示同意、吾人深信美國政府决將貫澈其從來之主張、而不致有承認僞組織事實云、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>英國决定不承認僞組織</h3>
<p>如情勢變遷亦須國聯討論</p>
<p>（南京）　記者二十三日晨晋晤英使時、曾詢以英對僞組織態度、據稱、英爲國聯忠實會員國、自當遵守國聯决議、决不承認僞滿、並對此項問題、不予考慮、記者復詢以英國此種態度、是否將因情勢之變遷而更改、買使繼稱、如情勢變遷、至國聯亦須考慮承認與不承認問題時、英國政府自亦當予以考慮、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>美日談判促開太平洋會</h3>
<p>法國報紙之評論</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法國報紙對華盛頓談判加以評論、法報信日本之目的、不僅討論遠東問題、且海軍問題亦將提出討論、在舉行海軍談判時、日本定將要求美國承認「滿洲國」·修改美國移民律·以及撤消美國在斐律濱之海軍與航空根據地、作爲交換條件、法國方面預料非正式直接談判之結果、卽將促　成早開太平洋會議、各國關心於遠東問題者悉將參加云云、（二十三日世界社電）</p>
<h3>遠東問題已成國際性質</h3>
<p>孟却斯德導報之評論</p>
<p>（倫敦）　孟却斯德指導報今日批評美日換文事、謂日本此舉、乃蘇俄外長李維諾夫獲得美國承認所致、美國務總理赫爾所稱、凡與遠東有關係各國之問題互相商權一點、殊關重要、蓋無異登記遠東問題之國際性質也云、據紐約時報東京訪電、日政府對於菲列濱之將來地位及菲島陸軍根據地之處置、固認爲純屬美國事件、但亦願善意考慮擔保菲島中立與獨立之提議云、（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>美日諒解之觀察（昂若）</h3>
<p>國際問題之解决。不出外交談判與武裝干涉與戰爭三道。華盛頓會議成而山東問題决。此爲國際問題由外交談判解决者之一例。俄法德三國干涉還遼。亦爲武裝調停之顯證。至於戰爭。則係外交無效干涉失敗之末路。鑒於兵兇戰危之戒。惕於勝敗難卜之懼。苟非懷抱窮兵黷武之狂妄心理。或逼處國本動搖之危險時機。不願輕易爲孤注之一擲。自巴爾幹問題引空前大戰。世人方盡瘁於艱鉅之復興事業。戰旣不能。和又無法坐是遠東問題乃陷於僵局。</p>
<p>近頃日外相廣田與美國務總長赫爾酬答之文發表。世人視聽爲之一震。此固美日關係上一大轉變。亦遠東問題前途一大關鍵。與美俄復交一事同具深意。美日諒解已至何種程度。將來演化又將至何種境地。局外人固無從推斷。而我外交當局。則應急起警戒。凖備所以應付。似無待言。</p>
<p>各方對此美日諒解。已種種揣測。實則以吾人觀察。此不過萬分棘手之遠東問題。將漸次陷入二次大戰之危機。導入外交談判之發端耳。問題本身。仍有待於將來之折衝。變化正未可預定。至於能否解决與如何解决。尙未易言。卽羅斯福總統與廣田外相恐亦無此把握也。</p>
<p>電傳美日初步諒解中提出之問題。爲美國修改移民律。放棄菲列濱海軍根據地。及承認僞國。日本則以維持現行五·五·三海軍比率爲交換。談判之途徑。則須俟日本駐美大使齋藤返東京磋商。再於明年舉行海軍會議。同時舉行二次太平洋會議。參加會議之國。除簽訂九國公約之美·英·中·日·法·意·荷·比·葡·外。再加入與遠東問題有密切關係之蘇俄。猶憶國聯處理東北問題失敗之時。卽有人主張召集九國公約國會議者。遠東局勢僵持至今。非待以大戰作總解决。卽惟有二次華盛頓會議。作妥恊的外交解决之一途。</p>
<p>今暫將與吾人僅有次要關係之移民問題。菲島問題。及海軍比率問題。存而不論。試就所謂承認僞國問題加以推測。美國之遠東政策。以開放門户主義及九國公約爲兩大基礎。而此兩大基本政策之出發點。均爲對日。巴黎和會未能使日以山東還我。美國輿論大譁。威爾遜政策因以失敗。凡爾賽和約。我國拒絶簽字。美參院亦不予批准。當時之美日關係。惡化程度。與今日相彷彿。迨太平洋會議成立九國公約。第一條卽規定。「尊重中國之主權與獨立及領土與行政之完整。」又曰。「不得因中國狀况。乘機營謀物别權利。而减少友邦人民之權利。並不得奬許有害友邦安全之舉動。」該約第二條復規定。「締約各國恊定不得彼此間單獨或聯合與任何一國或多國訂立條約或恊定或恊議或諒解足以侵犯或妨害第一條所稱之各項原則者。」僞國爲日本一手造成以掩飾侵略。在國際上已成定案。在我國内政上。則溥儀之僭號。實構成叛逆行爲。國際關係雖極變幻莫測。羅斯福總統雖一再以非常舉動昭告我人。然若謂其將推翻一切史汀生主義·國聯决議·以至九國公約。更不得友邦同意。不顧嚴重之後果。逕行承認僞國。以爲促進其自身復興之手段。則實非吾人理智所能想到者。</p>
<p>華盛頓電有云。「觀察者對於此次之磋商。以爲與遠東有關之各國。均宜參加日美討論。又謂復文中美國表示。太平洋問題之解决。須受現行條約之束縛。良以此係多邊的而非單粹的日美兩國間之問題也。此間對於承認「滿洲國」之舉。雖多揣測之詞。以爲美國在未得中國蘇俄參加以前。或不致有此一舉去。」此實近似眞相之談。觀此可知美國仍無撕毁現行條約之意。而日本之行動。處處又與現行條約相違反。則遠東問題。欲於無背於國際條約之精神與文字中。與關係國試謀解决。爲期豈不尙遠。</p>
<p>更據倫敦電訊。美日諒解。英甚歡迎。又稱。美將首勸我國爲解鈴者。而以各國駐華公使。昇格大使。以爲交換。是則問題之癥結。仍在我國之好自爲之耳。</p>

<h3>晉省榆次去年各業盈虧調查</h3>
<p>倒閉商號二百五十餘家</p>
<p>經濟衰落市面甚爲蕭條</p>
<p>榆次通訊、自春節迄今、商號歇業者、日有所聞、記者赴商會調查、最近城市各商號倒閉者、共計一百六十四家、鄉村九十四家、故市面甚爲蕭條、茲更將存在之各商號、上年盈虧狀况、及倒閉者之經過情形、分誌于左、</p>
<p>紡織電氣　（一）晉華紡織廠爲榆次最大之工廠、資本四百萬元、上年營業、九月份止損失共三十七萬餘元、自十月至年底、紗銷漸有起色、更以賤價購花四萬餘包、故三個月間、獲利十萬元、經本月七日董事會議决、仍發半數官息四厘、本届股東會議、定於四月二十九日舉行、（二）魏榆電汽廠、亦爲榆次大規模企業之一、資本十萬元、因開支浩繁、上年盈餘一萬元、不發官息、紅利僅合五厘餘、加之今年商號倒閉過多、用户銳减、營業不振、股東會現已委託董事經理、籌議維持方法、</p>
<p>銀錢業　此間錢莊銀號共二十四家、報歇者有晉西隆·晉升恒·永全泰·廣義隆·晉川·晉豐吉·永興泰·德義逢·聚生·大樂裕·廣全慶·集義長·元盛等十三家、總計資本在四十萬元以上、其他因虧累而須清償者、尙不在内、目下所存者僅晉信·正心裕·義聚德·鈺源永·萬利恒等十一家、除晉信莊獲利八千餘元、正心裕六千餘元、義襄德五千餘元、鈺源永四千餘元外、其餘僅能維持開支而已、至銀錢業虧折之原因、約有兩端、（一）因多貪農村高利貨、（二）因市上經融枯竭、週轉不靈、乃大受影響、</p>
<p>彩帛業　彩帛業因存貨多、售價跌、故二十家中倒閉者有永泰蔚·四義興·德聚恒·義豐泰·謙元吉·乾生豫·吉履新·義恒和·錦生集等九家、且以年代久、著名而資本大者居多數、合計各號資本、約在三十萬元以上、負債十餘萬元、股東一籌莫展、現存者祇元吉昇·瑞凝霞·等十一家、除瑞凝霞在凉州等處外莊、尙能獲利五六千元外、其餘堪以自給者、已屬鳳毛麟角、</p>
<p>花布業　是業因受貨價慘跌、農村購買力弱、及捐稅影響、一蹶不振、其所負之營業稅、每家多至二三千元、故總數十七家中、倒閉者已有利晉公司·晉盛永·瑞生祥·吉逢厚·麗泉茂·永合·聚慶湧·榮德益·永和·廣義隆·保和厚·吉逢成·等十二家、除吉逢厚·吉逢成兩家外、其餘資本亦在十五萬元以上、晉通花店因資本雄厚、獲利約二萬三千餘元、恊成裕亦稍有盈餘、此外能開支相抵者、已屬萬幸、</p>

<p>糧業　是業因糧價慘跌、捐稅繁重、且營此者又富於投機性、故十五家中倒閉者有德豐利·聚錦川·復生恒·和記·德盛亨·廣順義·德聚祥·慶和亨·德裕生·慶裕豐·天義·晉豐正·等十二家、合計資本亦在二十萬元以上、現存者僅吉泰公等三家、亦損失非輕、</p>
<p>酒麵業　酒業因民衆購買力薄弱、酒稅加重、麵業則因麥價傾跌、營業减少、故二十五家中倒閉者有德盛永·通泉湧·等十一家、資本亦在七八萬元以上、現存僅有魏榆麫粉廠、德順泉等十四家、麫粉廠資本十四萬元、無官息、僅能獲利一萬二千五百餘元、其餘小資本者大多賠累、</p>
<p>運輸業　因貨運减少、負担奇重、故損失較他業爲鉅、總數八家中倒閉者有惠逢長·亨利通·等二家、資本均萬餘元、現存者義合永·萬豐·吉泰隆·義盛通·義勝合等六家、除義合永等販運棉花、尙能獲利外、其他虧多盈少、</p>
<p>菸業　現因一般人競吸本省晉華紙烟者多、且英美烟又歸晉華包銷、以致桐記菸莊、於上年八九月間開辦、今年卽隨永和公司·恒源號·三義烟棧·通記菸莊等閉歇、其餘旱菸業因銷數太少、泰昌亦已共八十一家、而十二同業中之五業、如衣布業·烟業·運輸業·當業·糧業·等、因不足法定會員人數、已有不能成立同業公會之勢、（三月十四日）</p>

<h3>吳藴初創辦天利淡氣製品廠</h3>
<p>廠址勘定機器已購</p>
<p>明春可以開工製造</p>
<p>與部辦硫酸錏廠分工合作</p>
<p>中央社云、日前各報多載有美聯社西雅圖電、謂該處太平洋亞摩尼亞化學工廠之機械、已由恒信火藥公司售與不知姓名之買主、在兩星期内移至上海、該廠本係製造肥田料者、但稍加修改、卽可製造火藥品云、而昨日各西報又有本埠實業家向法國定購機器利用上項機器之出品、以製造硝酸、而兩者係屬於同一組織之紀載、但美聯社旣不知買主姓名、且又云恒信公司方面拒絶詳述出售情形、而硝酸廠亦未詳誰屬、嗣經記者多方探聽、始悉此兩廠、屬於同一公司、而天廚味精廠實爲其中心、記者特又往訪該廠經理吳藴初、據談如下、</p>
<p>經營動機　據吳氏談、各種小工業、大多本輕利重、基本工</p>
<p>業、則適得其反、天廚廠近年來自身勉能立足、故從事於他人認爲不易辦不願辦、而在民族的立塲上、不能不辦之化學工業、肩此重任、努力邁進、五年前已着手綠氣工業、創辦天原電化廠、現該廠根基已固、第二步又創設淡氣工業廠、蓋淡氣工業、實操民族生殺之權、因五穀蔬果、旣賴淡氣肥料以生、而無硝酸、（重要淡氣製品之一）卽無以供國防之需、</p>
<p>明春製品　此項工廠、名爲天利淡氣製品廠、股本百萬元、業已集足、機器已分向美法兩國購定、卽數日來中外各報上所稱之兩廠也、現向美訂購之機器、已由美裝出、大約一個月後抵滬、從事裝置、約需五個月、届時向法定購者亦可運到、繼續設置、故全部竣工、約需七八個月、而開工製造、須在明年春初、廠址已勘定於滬西陳家渡天原廠左近、因一二八後、閘北市况凋敝已極、該地水電廠頗受影響、天利廠將來開工後、每用電達五萬度以上、對於電流之銷售、不無助力也、</p>
<p>製造步驟　至該廠製造、係分二個步驟、向美定購之機器、係將空氣中之淡氣、與水中之輕氣、觸媒而成亞摩尼亞、而由法購來之機器、則係將亞摩尼亞與養氣觸媒而成硝酸、據估計該機、每日可產硝酸十一噸、惟如需要增加、則可產至兩倍之鉅、上述兩項出品、在工業上均係重要之原料品、惟該廠着重於硝酸之出產、蓋可以製造肥田粉、爲沃田之用、至該廠對於實業部之硫酸錏廠、雖同係空中淡氣、固定事業、然部辦者專製硫酸錏、此則注重硝酸及硝酸鹽、固分工而合作也、</p>

<h3>三門灣建棧埠開航路</h3>
<p>招商局分兩步進行</p>
<p>開闢三門灣、已積極進行投貲之華僑、且已定四月一日、組織團體視察、招商局在該處建造碼頭與開闢航路、亦經議定、分兩步進行、茲將近訊探誌如下、</p>
<p>華僑投資　近來各地僑胞、在三門灣投資圈領附近曠地者甚夥、田價甚爲低廉、但因領購人多、已漸增漲、扣至現在三門灣被華僑圈領之地、已達三暪多畝、而所領之田、多在健壩區一帶、今已由領地之巨户梁勝等、組織健壩區領地委員會矣、</p>
<p>定期考察　各華僑爲助資興發三門灣起見、已由健壩區領户、組織華僑三門灣視察團、現已召集僑胞、組成一團、定四月一日、赴三門灣實地考察、研求開港與興發該地市面各業狀况、又投資者希望當局從速進行建港與通航兩大問題、使三門灣市面興發、地價增高、逐步達到成立之目的、</p>
<p>請求建埠　健壩區圈地委員會、近又呈請交通部、以三門灣之坂壩、與江洞港兩地、爲天然海港交通之地、爲通達浙江各地必經之區、建築三門灣、應在該二地、首先建造碼頭、特請交部以國家的立塲、令招商局在江洞港坂壩兩地、尅速起造輪埠、以爲三門灣開港之基礎、而於短時期内、先行開闢航綫、俾浙東貨運、可從該處出海云、</p>
<p>交部徴詢　交通部根據投資購地之健壩區、委員會呈文、卽轉令國營招商局、徴詢對於三門灣建造坂壩、及江洞港之輪船碼頭、與添開三門灣、至各地之航路情形、着卽擬具意見、卽行呈覆、招商局奉令後、已將此事提交營業船舶兩科、討論結果、對於建築坂壩與江洞港碼頭、與開闢航路、須分兩個步驟進行、第一步俟三門灣具港埠模型商市發軔時、卽起造江洞港碼頭貨棧、候貨物運輸有把握時、再開闢新航路、昨日呈報交部核奪矣、</p>
<h3>吳天民談東北最近狀况</h3>
<p>工商各業全爲日人壟斷</p>
<p>東北民衆莫不呌苦連天</p>
<p>無日不望中央收復失地</p>
<p>積極舖築鐵道以利軍事</p>
<p>新新社云、我東北四省、自「九一八」後相繼淪亡、雖尙有一般熱血志士、繼續在邊境與敵肉搏、無如一般民衆、事過境遷、置苦罔聞、殊爲惋惜、近有自僞境歸來之吳天民君、已於日前抵滬、參加皮鞋少將江民聲之難民自助團、以資自給、據語僞國近狀頗詳、茲將所述各節、分誌如後、</p>
<p>實行移民政策　自從一九三二年三月九日溥儀爲日人利用僭號後、日方對外、卽假此施用朦蔽之手段、一方面卽實行移民政策、其中以高麗人居十之七八、日人祇少數、移民之地帶、沿松花江之依蘭·哈爾濱·肇州·一帶爲最多、其次如洮四咱等附近、查東三省各重要城市、在九一八前幾年、無論工商各業、日人已佔有相當地位、故最近移民後、其工商業之壟斷、當可不言而喻</p>
<p>收復東北失地　日人佔據該地後、卽以欺騙之手段、企圖誘惑民衆、無如猙獰之面目、終於畢露、民衆咸感處處被日人操縱、以致營生艱難、平日遇與日人發生細微之糾紛時、必遭其虧、故該處民衆、莫不呌苦連天、無日不望中央早日收復東北失地、</p>
<p>没收民衆槍械　該處民衆、十九均有自衛槍械、蓋以胡匪多故、近來日人竊恐民衆乘機變亂、在靠近城市各區、已逐户没收、離城較遠者、有因向日軍部要求暫緩没收藉以防匪、日人恐過於嚴厲、或將引起不幸、故已暫允、預料不久當卽没收殆盡、</p>
<p>韓軍監視僞軍　僞國所編之部隊、名義號稱爲旅者、實則猶不足二團、每團之組織、祇少有二人任團部之顧問或參議、（其師旅則按比例遞加）辨其名目、雖似空銜、其實最高長官、如遇處理任何事務時、須受該顧問或參議之指揮、故全部僞軍、均爲日人所節制、不能得到行使之自由、近駐紮毘連華北之僞軍、日人慮其叛變、增調韓軍監視、以防不測、於此可見僞軍心理之一斑</p>
<p>積極鋪築鐵道　日方自佔東北四省後、以收買中東鐵道、難成事實、已積極舖築鐵道、以利軍事上之運輸、計已築成者爲吉哈鐵道·自吉林至哈爾濱·約長五百餘里、吉會鐵路·自敦化起至天寳山間、業已溝通、吉同鐵路、自吉林至同江、約長一千二百餘里、昻長鐵路、自昻昻溪至長春、計長約八百餘里、其餘未築成而在計劃中者、爲洮安至臚濱、計長約一千八百餘里之鐵道、</p>
<h3>商標論字形不問聲音滬廠商大恐慌</h3>
<p>認司法院解釋不近實情</p>
<p>商標糾紛將更層出不窮</p>
<p>遠東社云、關於商標法第一條第二項之規定、商標所用之文字·圖形·記號·或聯合式、須特别顯著一節、自經司法院解釋、謂商標法上之文字、僅指其所表現之形體、並不包括讀音在内云云、本埠各廠商、見此解釋後、咸不勝恐慌、僉以將因此授人易於冒牌、茲分誌是項解釋之經過、並廠商意見如次、</p>
<p>不同兩說　先是實部以該項規定、所稱「文學」、是否包括讀音在内、乃發生兩種解釋、甲謂·普通文字學分形·聲·義三類、讀音卽聲、應否包括讀音、乙謂·商標爲一種標章、參照本法第二條各欵所舉相同或近似之條件、如國壐、軍旗、官印、勳章、黨旗、黨徽、肖像、姓名、奬牌、褒狀、商號等、均係具體之標識、與聲無涉、不應包括讀音、二說各有理由、又如包括讀音在内、中國福員廣大、方言龐雜、而商品行銷、當在全國、遇有讀音近似問題發生、如漫無標凖、則糾紛萬狀、究以何種讀音爲據、</p>
<p>解釋原文　其後該部呈由行政院、咨請司法院解釋、當經司法院咨覆轉示、茲從實部駐滬辦事處、探得司法院咨覆原文、爰照錄如下、（上略）此案業經本院統一解釋法令會議議决、商標法第一條第二項、對於商標所用文字、祇謂須特别顯著、並指定所施顏色、足見商標法上之文字、僅指共所表現之形體、並不包括讀音在内、徴之同</p>
<p>法第二條所例各欵、亦皆指示形體、與讀音無涉、其義益明、相應咨復、</p>
<p>廠商意見　本埠各廠商、得閱司法院上項解釋後、頓起甚大之恐慌、據廠商中之某有力者、昨與遠東社記者談、司法院此種解釋、未免太不近廠商實情、行銷有年之老牌商標、勢將不免爲奸商冒充、蓋以我國國民敎育、未能普及、識字者不多、如對文字商標、祇論文字之形體、不問字之讀音、實不啻祇要眼看、而不要耳聽、譬如甲廠出品、用「山羊」爲商標、乙廠見甲「山羊」出品、行銷甚廣、於是乃以「三陽」爲商標、出同類貨品、混售市上、彼不識字之顧客、又何從辨别耶、恐將來商標糾紛纒訴之案、較今尤層出不窮也云云、</p>

<h3>蘇民政廳長辜仁發之妾李淑芸因要案被逮</h3>
<p>由法捕房協助在新民村拘獲李氏母女</p>
<p>昨經徐樸誠等將李氏等押解無錫法院</p>
<p>丨無錫公安分局長抗不移交由李主謀丨</p>
<p>無錫馬路區公安第二分局局長劉倬民、最近奉令免職、李以蘇民廳長辜仁發之妾李淑芸爲護符、抗不移交、民廳得訊、下令逮捕李淑芸歸案訊辦、前日已將李淑芸母女在滬拘獲、昨日解往無錫、茲紀前後經過詳情如下、</p>
<p>免職經過　無錫馬路區公安第二分局局長劉倬民任職五月、辦理局務、精神萎靡、整飭無方、以致成績毫無、經該縣公安局長李文恭、將劉停職、遺缺調現任第一分局長高崇山接充、惟劉係由民廳委任、且其妻李榮貞、與民政廳長辜仁發之妾李淑芸、義結姊妹、感情極爲融洽、故劉分局長接得縣分安局之停職命令後、卽命伊妻李榮貞出面、急電鎭江辜廳長之妾李淑芸處報告消息、請求設法援助、</p>
<p>殷勤懇托　辜妾李淑芸、以廳長被蔣委員長召往南昌行營聽訓、尙未返鎭、急切間無法可想、遂偕同蕭秘書立卽離鎭、於十四日抵錫、寓新世界旅社、當時劉倬民聞訊、卽與其妻前往殷勤招待、在西菜間請吃西菜、當時並有五分局長彭希文相陪、席間劉卽殷殷懇托李芸淑代爲設法、當時李一口允諾、並命劉放心、靜俟辜廳長返省收回成命、</p>
<p>抗不交卸　翌日、李淑芸卽行離錫赴滬、十五日晨間、李公安局長以令知公文已發出多日、卽命督察長章裕偕同新任局長高崇山前往接收、詎劉倬民當以有恃無恐、遂不移交、並謂「我係辜廳長派我來的、若要免職、須待廳令到此、方肯移交」等語、</p>
<p>武裝接收　章督察長等無奈、卽將情形回報李局長、李聞悉大怒、立派長警補習所敎務主任余滌塵·督察員劉仁義·范天行·等、會同高分局長等前往武裝接收、及抵該局、詎劉倬民見勢不佳、避匿不見、局内僅劉妻李榮貞在彼大發雌威、肆意漫駡、甚至碰檯拍凳、污啻頻頻、</p>
<p>藏匿槍械　高分局長等聞言、未加答覆、卽檢查局内一切、不料局中所有鈐記印信以及短槍四十四支忽失所在、質諸局中警員、僉謂已被劉倬民藏匿、高分局長等以接收無從、卽再行報告李局長、由李親赴縣府、請示嚴縣長、經嚴縣長諭令高分局長先行辦分、劉妻如再無理取閙、着卽解送縣法院訊辦、高分局長奉諭後、卽前往先行視事、並由該局局員稽亞屏將各種文件卷宗移交、至於鈐記槍械、俱俟劉親自夥交、</p>
<p>捕李淑芸　至劉倬民嗣奉民廳命令逮捕、其妻李榮貞亦一併拘捕押解無錫縣公安局、移送無錫縣法院訊辦、同時民廳以劉案之主謀要犯、實爲民廳長辜仁發之二夫人李淑芸、查李已偕母李氏（五十三歲）潛逃來滬、匿居法租界馬浪路新民邨十五號黃公館内、卽由辜廳長備文、委派本廳庶務股主任劉安熙·興江蘇水上省公安隊第一區長徐樸誠、於二十日來滬、投法捕房報請恊拘移提歸案訊辦等情、</p>
<p>拘獲母女　當經捕頭飭派中西探按址馳往馬浪路新民邨十五號黃毛、將李淑芸李氏母女拘獲、并搜查尙無犯罪證據發現、遂卽帶回捕房、訊據李淑芸供、民政廳長辜仁發、是我丈夫、我因患胃病、於十三日由南京來滬、至大陸商塲四樓四一九號孔醫生處診治、丈夫於十二日往南昌晋謁蔣委員長、我丈夫决不爲告發我之舉、對劉倬民抗不交卸之事、我全不知情、我之認識劉倬民、由劉妻文蓉珍（并非李榮貞）之介紹、緣劉前爲丈夫之舊部屬等語、李氏供住長沙肇家坪二號、此次因女兒有病同來、捕頭據供、遂命暫押、</p>
<p>捕房意見　翌日移解第二特區地方法院刑一庭、由李昌年推事升座提審、李淑芸截髮、身穿咖啡色綢旗袍、足登黑緞鞋、法官訊問被告等年齡·籍貫·住址·後、李淑芸時露苦笑、卽據捕房律師顧守熙陳明案情、稱兩被告由捕房根據民政廳來員、水上公安隊第一區長徐撲誠·與劉安熙·報告、爲與無錫公安局第二分局長劉倬民藏械匿印、抗不交卸一案有關、請求派探恊助拘捕到案、惟探員於逮捕時、搜查被告等寓所、尙無絲毫犯罪證據發現、故捕房根據恊定第七條規定、如非正式法院前來移提、須要有被告等充份之犯罪證據提出、方能引渡、今捕房意見、須由民廳來員、於最近期内提出相當證據、則捕房是不反對、且本案之告發人辜仁發、係現任蘇省民政廳長、亦卽第一被告之丈夫、旣與被告有密切之夫婦關係、捕房方面更當審愼從事云云、</p>
<p>請求移提　繼據民廳來員徐樸誠·劉安熙·呈送公文、請准移提兩被告歸案訊辦、又據劉安熙稱、李淑芸確是辜廳長之太太、她在外招搖賣官歛錢、此次劉倬民之抗不交卸、查係是她主謀、業經省府陳主席禀准蔣委員長、命令緝捕歸案訊辦、詎她乘辜廳長赴南昌謁蔣時、逃來上海、故由縣長派我等來滬、報請捕房拘捕、請准移提、訊之李淑芸供、對劉案完全不知、旋由被告所延之章士釗·項洵譚辛震律師等相繼發表意見、庭上乃對來員　知、劉案旣經無錫法院受理、本案亦應由無錫法院來文移提、此案現由無錫縣法院檢察處備文、派法警楊樹滋·馮永寳·來滬、於昨晨投第二特區法院迎提、法院卽通知捕房、將被告等解送法院、由李推中特開刑二庭審訊、先由來警呈送公文、請求移提、</p>
<p>母女大哭　繼由捕房代表顧律師起稱、查官廳引渡人犯、乃恊定規定、應請庭上依法裁奪、訊之李淑芸供、前在長沙遵導會學校畢業、後於民國二十年六月二十二日由金秀佛之介紹、嫁與現任江蘇民政廳長辜仁發爲妻、在漢口中央旅社結婚、由李云恭證婚、任和濱主婚、過門後、迄今始知辜前妻尙健在、且生子女多人、當向辜質問、他說對他個人名譽地位攸關、呌我切勿張揚、他自有辦法、與前妻離婚可也、不料現今忽有如此之事來害我、我對劉倬民之案、完全不知情的、實情寃枉、供畢、母女二人掩面大哭、李推事諭謂、本案係恊助案件、且經無錫縣法院受理在前、應准移提歸案訊核、被告母女聞諭、更放聲大哭、謂我等若然引渡過去、恐中途必遭加害我等生命、庭上下諭爾等如果寃枉、無錫縣法院亦當公平判斷、决不爲難你們、如恐中途有難爲之處、本院可派法警伴送、諭畢、卽宣告退庭、被告等帶下至法警室、由來警僱得汽車直駛北站、乘車赴錫法院畢案審訊、</p>

<h3>怎樣研究東北問題（四）</h3>
<p>昨日本欄對於本問題已提出總的方法上的討論略爲論過了。今日接着來具體的從第一組對立開始問題的檢討。編者</p>
<p>首先，我們從第一組的對立開始檢討。</p>
<p>帝國主義與帝國主義相互間的對立從一九二九年世界經濟恐慌開始後，就從比較沉潛的姿態一天天露骨的顯出白熱化了。鬥爭的塲面，隨着恐慌的深入，普遍而展開了，這一鬥爭反映在東北的是兩條路綫的鬥爭，卽以日本爲領導的獨佔滿洲利益的路綫與美國爲領導的維持「門户開放」，「土地完整」的路綫。國聯國家（自然日本除外）的態度在當時也以贊同後者爲有利，其他的帝國主義則因利害較少，他們的主張，到底不能成爲主要的意見，暫且不表。這鬥爭的暴發自然是有必然性的，但暴發於一九三０年則完全由於經濟恐慌及由此而生的政治危機之所賜，給了日本金融資產階級（不說日本軍閥而說金融資產階級是因爲日本軍閥不過是金融資產階級的工具，日本軍部是秉承這金融王侯之命而行事的。）用殖民地侵略戰爭去解决國内經濟恐慌，和緩政治上的危機的一種新剌激。當時國際帝國主義全面的關係，又因着恐慌的深入，由相對的均勢而趨全面的動搖，瓦解了，這給了日本以優越的形勢。於是，日本利用了反蘇的號召（以下還要詳細說的）而「九一八」因此就誕生了。</p>
<p>這一變動自然要驚動全世界，這是太平洋上帝國主義的力的改編的開始，也就是第二次世界大戰的信號。</p>
<p>現在返觀三年以來這一組對立的發展，我們已可看出，至少在日本方面已取得突破昔日的均勢和粉碎美國及國聯「共管」路綫的勝利了。直到最近，事實上已說明了日本的路綫在整個的中國領土内開展，而國聯國的本身亦產了日本的路綫了。譬如繼滿洲而起的有内蒙的自治，南疆的獨立，九小島的被佔，藏兵的内犯，滇礦被奪等等，這已說明由共管路綫走入瓜分路綫了。最近美日間新諒解的成立，並不能認爲是偶然的事，這不過是這一組對立在遠東的發展，隨着英美兩雄爲主幹的國際鬥爭的消長而現出一形態，果眞明年太平洋上十國會議能開得成功的話，那或者就是日本的路綫完全的勝利（實行瓜分中國），但並不是日本的勝利，接着的是由此路綫而必然暴發出分贓的戰爭，結果仍是戰爭。雖然，我們没有英國文學家偉爾斯先生那般大胆的作出一些無謂預言來恫人觀聽，但東北問題總離不了在這一組對立上發展的，而這一組對立的發展傾向，我們敢於負責的說已經把握住了。</p>
<p>許多高等華人看到這一組對立，郤生出依賴國聯或美國的心理，這想玩那「发夷制夷」的老把戲，還想回復那已去勢了的均勢，等到事不如願時，又復幻想到「同種同文」「大亞細亞主養」方面去，完全認賊作父。以外還不不少熱心的青年看了日本經營滿洲，痛哭流淚的嘆「民心將去」，「東北再過十年就無法收回了。」這都是由於不在動態中去了解這一组對立的發展，或者只看見一時的現象，誤認爲是不變的，或者孤立的看見日本一時經營滿洲的榮繁，忘記世界經濟恐慌是無孔不入的，滿洲卽</p>
<p>令一時榮繁，也不能有例外。並且目下的滿洲，日本何嘗能使它榮繁呢？方君不是說過「毒化政策」麽？這「毒化政策」的基礎是什麽？我們不能同意方君所暗示的意見，說那是完全出於民族的屠殺的倫理的觀念。它明明是經濟恐慌下，殖民地農業破產後，一種變態的生產。日本明明不能救出滿洲的經濟恐慌（尤其是農業恐慌）猶如不能打開本國内的恐慌一樣，日本的農產品已是過剩了，她决不能使滿洲的農業作經常的發展，於是有勒令農民種烟之舉。這决不是替日本辯護，這是說，如果世界市塲此時需要小麥，大豆，日本資本家决不會忘了這種正常的並且有利可圖的生產而來幹此不道德的經營的。在商人的「生意經」中，生利明明是唯一的暹輯，所謂民族的怨恨，離開了「富」的刦奪就是日本的資本家，想來也會感覺毫無意義罷！這已赤裸裸的暴露東北農村之破產，日本無力榮繁東北，日本不能挽救東北跳出恐慌，東北同胞生活日加惡化，這裏埋伏着的是求生存而將燃去的反抗的火花，不是臣服日本，忘懷中國。同時，這運命也不由於日本作主，這是資本主義制度必然結出的果實。所以，方君憂懷，雖然出自愛國，因爲觀察時把其他因素去掉了，結果反成了有害的悲觀主義。</p>
<p>還有許多觀察者，大抵能把握住這一組對立的原則，郤不想將日在變化中的新事態加入進去，以吸取新的材料，充實其研究的内容，譬如最近滿洲國改制，大家都有一點興奮似的，然而對南疆獨立，蒙古自治等反默然無聲，他們對於民族的危機的了解，祇停留在「九一八」階叚，不能將這些同一本質的新事變聯擊起來，在這些新的事變中，去認取「東北事變」之嚴重性。</p>
<p>總之：這一組對立現在仍在發展中，在中國</p>
<p>民族解放戰爭没有擴大和勝利以前，它仍有决定東北問題的作用，我們仍值得時時加以注意。（未完）</p>

<h3>中國敎育建設社致力農村生產事業</h3>
<p>黃渡養雞塲一年來之工作概况</p>
<p>中國敎育建設社、年來致力於生產敎育事業、頗具成績、去年春間、該社與江蘇省立黃渡鄉村師範合資創辦黃渡養雞塲、其目的在求改良我國雞種、以增進農村之副業生產、創辦以來、未及一載、成績斐然、茲將該塲近况、簡述如下、以供</p>
<p>致力於農村生產敎育者之參考、</p>
<p>現有雞種　該塲於去年二月間租得黃渡鄉村師範農塲農地十餘畝爲塲址、爰卽興工自建新式大小雞舍四幢、購置孵化機保姆器、以及其他養雞用具、三月間開始孵化育雛、先後繁殖、成績甚佳、現有白色單　來克享雌雞二百餘翊、已於去年十一月間開始產卵、</p>
<p>育種工作　現該塲正努力於育種工作、曾於去年十月間嚴造優雌五十羽、自十一月一日起開始採用囚巢記錄其產量、於茲已閱四月、聞各雌之產率、平均竟能超出八成、且羽色美麗、雞體精壯、實爲不可多得之種雄、此外塲中又留造十餘羽壯雄、體重約在五斤以上、頗合種雄之標凖、本年一月間、採行成對配種法（MatinginPairs）分羣配種、迄今已二月有奇、每日可留取</p>
<p>優良種蛋二十餘枚、除自給外、稍有餘剩、而外方陸續來函定購者甚多、頗有供不應求之概、</p>
<p>積極擴充　該塲創辦至今、歷時甚短、但已有相當之基礎、今年猶積極擴充、增殖雌雞五百</p>
<p>羽、以爲推廣雞種之凖備、新建雞舍三幢、不日可告竣工、第一次孵化、業於三月六日開始、春節以前、卽可育雛、</p>
<p>招工學生　該塲近感國内養雞技術人才缺乏、特招收工學生、俾於一年内學得養雞學識與技能、以應社會之需要、聞四該塲工學生、除自備膳食及缴納保證金一百元外、不另取費、今已招到一名、係江蘇省立上海中學畢業生、曾於二月初旬入塲學習、</p>

<h3>中距離跑名將王銘紳由東北抵北平</h3>
<p>血氣尙存不願作二等亡國奴</p>
<p>將繼續練習準備出席遠運會</p>
<p>（北平通訊）　數年馳名中國田徑界之中距離跑健將王銘紳、自東北事變後、關内久未得其消息、昨王忽自哈爾濱乘車來平、下榻東北體協會、記者特往訪問、據王談稱、</p>
<p>來平動機及其經過　余（王自稱）自東北事變後、卽伏居哈爾濱、血氣尙存不願做僞國走狗、時欲設法返歸關内、當符保盧吳景耀等在哈時、余等三人時以此相勉勵、嗣後符吳離哈、余因故未能同行、茲有機可乘、乃决脫離二等亡國奴生活、毅然來平、此後將一方繼續求學、一方將努力練習中距離跑、備參加最近之遠東會預選會云、</p>
<p>于希渭甘心附逆？　王又云、僞國對運動特别提倡、同時欲轉移青年愛國思想、故對運動員特别拉攏、本人在哈時、僞國曾派數人接洽、請本人參加在僞都之運動會、均經本人拒絶、于希渭現在僞國文敎部任事、且已有某種嗜好、前途殊無希望云云（按、王銘紳、現年二十六歲、哈爾濱人、本在馮庸大學肄業、其八百米成績、爲一分五十八秒八、四百米成績爲五十二秒八、千五百米四分十六秒、在國中殊屬罕有）、</p>
<h3>江大籃球賽復旦戰勝中央</h3>
<p>復旦勝中央五一比二九</p>
<p>暨南勝持志五九比二十</p>
<p>今日有兩塲</p>
<p>在南京以二十九比二十七戰勝暨南之中央大學籃球隊、日前來滬作江大體協會籃球賽、昨與復旦交鋒於江灣、此賽與本届錦標、似有極大關</p>
<p>係、良以中央旣能勝暨南、似亦有冠軍希望者、而復旦實力素强、奪標呼聲最高、此次相會、滿擬有一塲劇戰、詎料相形之下、中央生手生脚、隊伍散漫、與復旦相去頗遠、上半時二十六比九、下半時中央大爲努力、造成二十九比五十一之敗績、另一塲暨南勝持志、爲一面倒形勢、五十九比二十、暨南大勝、兩組均無女子比賽、今日亦有兩塲比賽、秩序如下、</p>

<p>復旦勝中央</p>
<p>形勢懸殊　復旦籃球房中、擠滿該校學生、眞所謂滿坑滿谷、法官周家騏下令動員、客軍徐標首紀錄、復旦大爲努力、工作細腻、周達云趙不忝連得六分、聲勢大盛、中央在復旦控制之下、難於活動、而復旦防禦嚴密、傳遞嫺熟、表演美妙非凡、比數忽變爲十八比三、中央極力振作、得不償失、二十六比九、形勢懸殊、</p>
<p>中央奮起　上半時過後、復旦趙不忝手法大順、一中再中、成三十四比九、丘廣爕陳宗祺亦加三分、成三十七比九、此爲復旦之全盛時代、中央遭此挫折、力圖振作、果然形勢轉機、氣焰大盛、後衛吳壽祺俞晋祥相繼得分、趙不忝繼續還中、成四十一比十六、中央徐鏢周鶴鳴鍾季卿等一再建功、分數大增、局勢忽見平衡、後成二十九比四十三、復旦最後掙扎、再演美技、造成五十一比二十九之結果、復旦人材平均、球藝殊佳、陳宗祺之後衛、實爲後起中之佼佼者、趙不忝之投籃、尤爲不可多見、</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊交流收音機之電源專號（續）</p>
<h3>電源變壓器設計</h3>
<p>— 明喪</p>
<p>設計收音機的電源變壓器，第一步應計算收音機耗費的電力，就是眞空管各極應有的電壓及電流的相乘積，戰位爲瓦特。變壓器本身因有電阻及漏磁，須損失極小部份的電力，所以輸入的電力，恒較輸出爲大，輸入和輸出的百分</p>
<p>比，卽是變壓器的效率。</p>
<p>已知電力後，第二步應選擇適用的鐵心，變壓器鐵心，均用極薄的矽鋼片，相疊而成，蓋以防止渦流損失，磁塲密度，以每方寸有五萬至六萬的磁力線爲標凖，鐵心大小，通常均計算綫圈佔有部份的横截面積，適當的大小，可自表二第四行求之。</p>
<p>表一</p>
<p>電流　１·７Ａ　１·１　·６８　·４３　·２７　·１７　·１１　·０６７　·０４２　·０２６　·０１７</p>
<p>號綫　１６　１８　２０　２２　２４　２６　２８　３０　３２　３４　３６</p>
<p>表二</p>
<p>鐵心面積（方吋）　Ｉ　Ｉ·１４　Ｉ·２５　Ｉ·３６　Ｉ·５０　Ｉ·７０　Ｉ·７８　Ｉ·９０　２·２</p>
<p>每伏脫圈數　６·４　５·５　４·８　４·４　４·１　３·７５　３·３３　３·１　２·８４</p>
<p>效率　７０％　７５％　７５％　７５％　８０％　８５％　９０％　９０％　９０％</p>
<p>輸入電力（瓦特）　３０　４０　５０　６０　７０　８０　１００　１２０　１５０</p>
<p>第三步卽須計算各線圈負載的電流</p>
<p>，而求其適當粗細的導線，每一安培電流，應有横截面積Ｉ５００圓密爾的導線，方可安全，銅線號數及所能負荷的電流限度，如表一，導線的質料最好以漆包铜線爲佳，因絶緣極好，能耐高壓，且地位經濟，價值低廉。</p>
<p>最後便爲圈數的計算，可先在表二第三行，求出每伏脫應有的圈數，然後將初級及次級各缐圈，各依其需要的電壓數乘之，卽是正確的圈數，茲再舉一實例，以明設計的步驟。</p>
<p>圖示的變壓器，預備供給四燈收音機用的，次級有線圈三個，Ａ燃點兩只２２４及一只２４７眞管空燈絲之用，Ｂ燃點２８０整流管的燈絲，Ｃ爲高壓圈，以連接整流管的兩屏極，依眞空管特性表，得知Ａ電壓應爲２·５Ｖ，電流爲３１·７５＝５·２５Ａmp計算電力爲２·５Ｖ５·２５Ａ＝１３·１２Ｗ，Ｂ應爲５Ｖ２Ａ＝１０Ｗ的電壓，僅需計算一端至中心接頭的電壓，爲３５０Ｖ，電流假設爲０·０５Ａ，則電力爲３５０·０５＝１７·５Ｗ，變壓器級總電力約爲４０Ｗ，在表二第二行查得其效率爲７５％＝，故輸入電力應爲５５Ｗ，設初級爲２２０Ｖ，則電流爲·２５Ａ鐵心的大小可在表二末行，查查得面積應需１·３０平方时，線的號數可依照各綫圈需用的電流，在表一查得初級應用廿四號綫，Ａ可用三根十六號線並繞，Ｂ可用以十六號綫，Ｃ用卅一號，再從表二第三行查得每伏脫應有圈數爲４·６，故次級圈數，應爲Ａ２·５４·６＝１１·５Ｂ＝５４·６＝２３Ｃ７００４·６５２２０，在２６１０圈處接出一中心分頭，初級圈數，亦同法求之２２０４·６＝１０１２</p>
<h3>無變壓器之電源裝置</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>在交流收音機之電源部份，變壓器是最費錢而又麻煩的機件，並且變壓器自身旣笨重佔地位，而又使直流電無法通過，因此設計交流直流兩用機者，每思有以去之，而近年小型收音機風行以來，廢棄變壓器之要求更見迫切矣。</p>
<p>去除變壓器在Ｂ電方面比較不成問題，可直接以１１０Ｖ之商用電力供給；至於在低壓之絲極方面，如全憑耗阻降落，未免損失大，因是而有２５Ｖ·絲極之丨４３，２５Ｚ５等眞空管出矣。</p>
<h3>圖一</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>此等新式眞空管之無變壓器電源裝置，見圖一便可明白。交流輸入之一端接於整流管屏極，同時接於串連之眞空管絲極。其他一端則接於絲極回路。經過整流後之電流由陰極輸出。</p>
<p>如圖一所示，三管之絲極係串聯連接，而以耗阻Ｒ助其降落電壓。Ｒ之數值可以下公式求之。</p>
<p>耗阻歐姆數＝供給之電壓丨各眞空管電壓之和／眞空管絲極所需之電流</p>
<h3>圖二</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>例如圖一中之－７７絲極爲６·３Ｖ·４３，２５Ｚ５皆爲２５Ｖ，共爲５６·３Ｖ，今以１１０Ｖ，之電壓供給之，减去５６·３Ｖ尙餘５３·７Ｖ。上舉三管之絲極電流均爲０·３安培，以０·３除５３·７則所得爲１７９歐姆，此卽絲所需之數值。在此種裝置中，吾人須注意使通過谥各管之電流相等，如圖二所用之－５７，－５７皆爲１·０安培，而－４３，２５Ｚ５則僅０·３安培，其間相差０·７安培，故須以耗阻Ｒ１與之並聯補足此０·７安培０Ｒ１之數值可以歐姆定律應有電壓／需要通過之電壓求之。－４３，２５Ｚ５之絲極電壓共爲５０Ｖ，以０·７除５０等於７１歐姆，此卽Ｒ１之數值。</p>
<p>凡採用無變壓器電源裝置之收音機，其接地之處須以電容嚴隔開，其接天綫之處最妥亦以電容器隔開，以防萬一天綫與地相觸，而致發生意外也。</p>
<h3>整流電源之濾波電路</h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>交流收音機，爲欲適用交流電源，必需具備下列三種機件：卽（一）變壓器（二）整流器與（三）濾波器。低壓一一０或二二０伏之交流電源經變壓器升高至適當高壓後，經整流管輸出而變爲顫動電壓（ＰulsatingVoltaga），故其輸出之電流爲顫動電流，其顫動週率卽爲電源之低週率（每秒五０或六０週）。此低週率或其倍週率之流電倘爲低週率變壓器所拾得或逕爲喇叭所拾得，則交流聲（hum）噪雜作矣。整流後之電源濾波電路卽爲除去此喇叭内之交流聲，故每一交流收音機内，必須具備一整流電源之濾波器，整流後之顫動電流輸入此濾波電路，經此濾波器之平滑作用（Smoothing）後，其輸出之電壓始爲直流電壓，所含交流電壓之成分極微，常僅爲直流電壓數千分之一而已。</p>
<p>濾波電路不外由阻流圈及固定電容器所成構。阻流圈自然爲低週率之鐵心阻流圈，以具有一０至五十亨利者爲適用；共作用爲平滑顫動電流，換言之，卽阻止電流之顫動，因阻流圈具有感應性，電流增加時，必因感應而生反電壓以阻止其增加，减少時，亦必引起正電</p>
<h3>圖一</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>壓以阻止其减少。所用電容器亦以具有大量電容自二至八兆分法拉特（mtd）者爲合用。電容器之作用在阻止電壓之顫動，以保持輸出之常壓；當電壓增高時，電容器因而荷電，至電壓降低時，電容器放電至電咱以增高</p>
<h3>圖二</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>其電壓，故顫動電壓得變爲常壓輸出。</p>
<h3>圖三</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>濾波電路種類頗多，因阻流圈與電容器之排列法而異。通常以圖一圖二圖三所示爲通用，尤以圖三爲最佳。圖二爲圖一这濾波電路添增一電容器，以平滑圖一電路所餘留之顫動電壓；圖三卽爲圖一與圖二所合并，較優美之收音機多用此式。Ｌ可用三０或五十亨利，Ｌ１可用一０或一五亨利，Ｌ１Ｌ２可用三十亨利之低週率阻流圈；如輸出之電壓不高，ＣＣ１Ｃ２Ｃ３可用八兆分法拉特，否則改用二或四兆分法拉特。每圖上之電流綫圖爲示顫動電流之輸入經濾波電路而變爲直流輸出之情形。</p>
<h3>特殊之整流裝置</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>交流收音機所用之整流器，普通可分電液整流器，（ElectrolyticRectifier），乾金屬圓片整流器（DryDrscrectifrer）及眞空管整流器（ThermionicRectifrer）三種。第一種因太累贅而又使用不便，故用之者甚少。第二種在上海無綫電材料舖中尙不能買到。第三種因需要眞空管及變壓器，所費頗昻，如用以供給單管機，殊不合算。</p>
<p>在上述三種整流器之外，吾人今獲一特殊之整流器。吾人夙知電解電容器（EletrolticCondenser）有僅許電流單方向流通之特性。電解電容器如用於交流電路中，便不能凝聚電化氣體，在陽極表面搆成薄膜以阻隔電流通過。吾人利用此二點特性，可以電解電容如圖裝置作整流器之用。圖中之Ｃ爲一雙連乾電解電容器，兩邊各４ＭＦＯＣＨ爲兩只二十亨利阻流圈。Ｒ２爲Ｏ－２５０００歐姆可變耗阻。Ｔ爲２·５Ｖ小方棚，Ｌ爲普通三回綫圈，Ｃ１爲··０００５ＭＦ可變電容器。Ｃ２爲·０００２５ＭＦ電容器，Ｒ１爲２ＭＥＧ栅漏阻，眞空管可用１５７或－２４。</p>
<h3>交流收音機電源的分析（續）</h3>
<p>— 孟激</p>
<p>（四）電位器　得到了定值的電壓，就可直接應用了。但因收音機裏各座眞空管的屏極和栅極，需要不同的電壓，所以電位器也不可少。電位器是一個定量耗阻器，牠的兩端，直接接至正負二極，中間各部，也有許多接綫，供給高低不同的電壓，因此，檢波管，放大管以及强力放大管上的電壓，都可自由選用了。栅極上的負電壓，大都也從同一電位器接出，因爲正負原是相對的名詞，假定以電位器上某一點的電壓，作爲零值，則比該點高一些的電壓，就作爲正，低一些的就是負了。</p>
<p>現在再把四部份的作用和次序，圖表出來，讀者參閱圖表，當更可明白各部份的關係了。圖之上部表示各部份連接的次序，下部表示各部份的作用，ＡＢ爲備考綫，亦卽表示零電位，各段曲綫，均於圖下說明，整流器下面所示顫動電壓的形狀，表明所用的是全波整流器，使交流電壓二個半週均爲有效，若爲半波整流器，則交流祇有半週有效，其他半週被割斷而失去效用了。ＡＢ也是一根備考綫，綫上波形曲綫，表示從變壓機出來的交流燈絲壓的形狀。</p>
<h3>整流電路</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>我們收音機裏的Ｂ電，是始終要用直流的，在交流機裏，雖然電源取之交流，但牠的Ｂ電，仍舊是從交流所變成的直流，因爲如果我們若把在一秒鐘内正負變換在數十次以上的交流，加到收音機内眞空管的屏極上，一定要有極大的交流聲，而把所需收聽的聲音，完全遮没，所以整流在交流機中，實在是很重要的了。</p>
<p>交流經過整流以後，就成爲顫重的直流如果用作充電，那末就可把牠充入蓄電池，但如用作代Ｂ電，則尙須經過一部濾波裝置，使顫動的直流，變爲純</p>
<p>粹的直流，再到收音機上去應用，因爲如果把這種顫動的直流，用到收音機的眞空管上去，仍舊有極大的營營聲，而</p>
<p>把需要的聲音遮住，所謂濾波裝置就是由低週率阻流圈及大量電容器組合而成，本刊另有「濾波電路」一文詳釋之，此處從略。（待續）</p>

<h3>各車由左邊走</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>在上海的馬路上，我們可以看到「各車由左邊走」的幾個字；在外國也是一樣，倫敦的馬路旁邊，寫着「Keep　the　left」</p>
<p>下至拉黃包車的無知識，他也不會把黃包車拉在馬路右邊走，因爲他曉得這是會發生若何的結果的，他會永遠記牢「各車由左邊走。」</p>
<p>倘若有一輛車子不遵行這條規定，在馬路的右邊行走，立刻就會發</p>
<p>生很不幸的結果，使一條路上甚而至於全市的交通，完全斷絶。</p>
<p>所以車子一定要由左邊走，才不會發生不幸。一個人對於行車和走路都知道規則，並且能遵守；可是對於規定的行車走路以外，郤完全不對了。</p>
<p>他們常常把車頭撞在一起，撞得頭破血流；他們寗願拚着不走，不願意向左邊讓開。</p>
<p>於是英國的肯茲敎授駡道：「……世界的不景氣，全由於世界中人</p>
<p>人的偏僻執拗的劣根性所造成。正如兩個汽車夫，相碰在大道之上，堅持各不相讓的態度一樣。……」</p>
<p>其實，世界的一切不安，全由於世界中人人的偏僻執拗的劣根性所造成，並不限於不景氣一樣的。這種劣根性表現在政治上面的時候，其影響之大，自不待言。</p>
<p>這種劣根性若不去除，中國很難有統一的命運。</p>
<h3>聰明的孩子？</h3>
<p>— 費鵬若</p>
<p>大凡做母親的，喜歡孩子聰明是伊的天性。伊一點喜歡心裏對人說</p>
<p>出伊孩子怎樣聰明時；這可說是世界上人與人之間最「眞實」的情感流露了。</p>
<p>某夫人有五個孩子，三個男的，二個女的。一個女的最大了，還不過六歲的年齡。夫人就最喜歡這個孩子是最聰明。因爲這個孩子聰明之點，是恰合了夫人的脾氣，只有夫人才能認明這點「聰明」是聰明，在别人或許是要否認的。</p>
<p>那孩子名字呌「討喜。」人家對這名字，都有些懷疑。但在夫人自己的肚裏，很自信這名字取得最有意義，而常使伊記念到往事的得意。伊曾對人說：「當那孩子將要生的前幾天，是個大喜的日子二房東「李師母」替伊兒子「納采」，夫人被邀到那裏去吃酒。酒罷，在座的幾位夫人，現成的湊攏一局，打十塊底的么二「馬將，」九圈完結，夫人竟赢了三底有另。這在夫人由賭以來得未曾有的倖遇，那時心裏喜歡也未嘗有過這樣的喜歡。而且從此一帆風順，第一二三…的幾天，也是連戰連捷。不想，一天忽然肚痛，生下那個不滿九月的女孩。夫人本常有句話：「赢錢有命。」伊相信自己没有「偏財」的命，於此知道此番赢錢是那孩子出世的來根，所以取名「討喜。」因爲這樣才是討人喜歡呢！」</p>
<p>討喜雖然六歲了，還不會說得像話，數字只能自一數至三爲止。但看見「馬將牌」的東，南，西，北，中，發，一二三……九那些字，却都早已認得了。並且奇怪，見了牌，伊人也變了，平時疙裏疙疸的頑皮，一跟伊娘到隣舍隔壁打牌去；伊會坐在桌角邊呆呆地死守。</p>
<p>並且能帮助娘照顧着「失張，」伊娘的牌裏面有對子的，人家打出來是同樣的一篗牌，伊會和娘同聲的喊聲「碰。」除此，伊聲不響，兩手是垂着的，兩眼是死瞪的，只是像注意地看。假使有時伊娘一缺三搭，或是三缺一搭，伊會關注着逕自把「王師母，」「李媽媽」呌攏來，所以伊娘最疼愛的是伊，就是「王師母，」「李媽媽」也讚伊一聲「好孩子」！</p>
<p>好孩子三字，在某夫人聽了自然更添上一重歡心，對人便更加讚伊女兒怎樣憄樣；並且把「馬將牌」拿來，給當面試騐，於是多數不相干的人，又讚一聲「孩子聰明」！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第二十六回　凄凉對玉鏡磋我懷人　慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國</p>
<p>王府井大街，那末寛的道，他們亂七八糟走着，塞滿了</p>
<p>一條街，街上的人全都躱躱閃閃的。那些矮鬼，越是瞧中國人這樣子，越是幌着膀子，叉着大腿，在街上胡撞。可憐的巡警，總怕給地面上惹下了亂子，只在街兩邊轟散閑人。擺小攤子的，挑担子的四處跑着，因爲我是穿灰色衣服的，他不敢轟，只望了我兩眼。我也明曉得闖出禍來，也是給地面上找麻煩，也只好閃到一邊去。可是我揑着拳頭，眞恨不得上前揍死他兩個。等他們走得遠了。我可就說了一句，哼！咱們前缐上見！連長，你没有瞧見那時候的情形，眞能在嗓子眼裏，吐出兩口熱血來。所以我說的那句話，也是氣炸了肺才說出來的。您猜怎麽着？我身後就有人冷笑了說，就憑你們？我回頭看時，那人跑了。他指着的你們，我想是兩件事，其一說咱們當大兵的，没有那個能耐。第二他聽了我說話是東北口音，說我東北人没有那種人才。但是無論他說那一方面吧？我都受不了那股之氣，到於今我想起來我頭髮杪上都有火。將來前線上要編敢死隊的話，我王某人就算一個。說着，連連拍了幾下胸脯。趙自强聽了他這話，也没有作聲，跳上坑去，就把墻上貼的紅喜聯撕了下來。最後，只剩得有點兒紅紙屑，也把它撕去了。王士立見他猛然的這樣做作，倒有些莫明其妙。趙自强把那紅紙撕得乾乾凈凈了，才跳下坑來，向王士立笑道：你大概不明白這是什麽原由吧？我告訴你，我瞧見這紅纸就想起做喜事，想起做喜事，自然會想起家庭來。老是這樣想着，可會把一肚子雄心打破，所以我把它撕了。（三四四）</p>
<h3>硯的研究（八）</h3>
<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>端硯概况</p>
<p>美文　端石以青花，魚腦凍，蕉葉白，天青，冰紋，各種火捺，　鵒眼，等爲美文。各美文中尤以青花一種最爲重要，名稱甚複雜，形態亦變化無窮，日人稱硯的論戰，祇有青花的論</p>
<p>戰，非無故也。</p>
<p>甲青花　石隱硯談謂，宋人論硯，大概不講青花，惟古硯辦始據唐吳淑硯賦點滴是青花一語，以證古坑之青花子石，然祇云有花點如筯頭大，碧玉精瑩。</p>
<p>又云：青黑中有白點如粟，排星斗異象，與近時所論青花铁不合，蓋因斯時所開下巖，尙未掘到深處也。其後逐漸開</p>
<p>發，精華盡露，而青花之種種形態，亦多爲人所認識。但人都知青花之可寳貴，而所以可寳貴的緣故，則從未有人揭發出來。卽愛硯的著述家，亦只說：「青花者，石之菁華也；」「石之極細者乃有青花，」然所以有此極細的菁華，亦</p>
<p>說不出其理由。而日人則從科學方法上，從端石的本質上，研究出青花特細的緣故，前所說坂東貫山所著的中國古硯與文藝一書（同事胡一臧君譯）内論青花，有這樣一段說數：</p>
<p>青花之本質何在乎？質言之，卽端石屬於</p>
<p>凝灰巖之水成巖，其構成分子中含有輝緑巖質之微分子，此微分子散布似微塵，或聚集則成粗點，尤以此微分子散布於與硯面硬度均衡之石者，方爲無上妙品。（卽微塵青花）但欲得如此精細之品甚難，蓋石之結晶狀，大抵以凹凸者爲多，端石所以比他石爲少者，卽藉此輝緑巖微分子之力也。有此微分子之硯，所發墨光，逈異尋常。</p>
<p>又其論石眼云：</p>
<p>石眼之質爲石連蟲，而其本體雜有輝緑巖，至石連蟲形似蛆蟲，或如蚯蚓狀，此蟲體爲石灰質，冲去石灰質而於其中滲入輝緑巖，以凝結成之也。端入謂石有青脈者必有眼，卽爲輝緑巖之顯示。</p>
<p>日人素研求礦石質學，故有是發明，中國從前則無此科學知識也。</p>
<p>吾人祇知青者爲青花，然其實不盡青也，微塵青花之緊密者近乎黑，蟻脚胥花之淡者，則近乎淺白，淺緑，或淡紅，微黃。故談青花者，須不泥一形，不拘一色，神而明之，始知其妙。石華之論青花，謂「青花欲細不欲粗，欲活不欲枯，欲沉不欲露，欲暈不欲結，欲渾不欲破。」以微塵爲最貴，次鵝氄，次蟻脚，（赤名蠅脚）次鵝氄結，（卽青花結，）又次玫瑰紫，又次蠅頭，（卽子母青花）其他成片成行粗而燥者不足重。而石隱所論，則更有蠅翅，蘋　，魚兒隊，芋紋，等名目。又有所謂冬瓜瓤者，高固齊以爲絶品，此外見於前人著述者，又有雨霖墻青花，蛤肚紋青花等，惟日人所論，則以雨霖墻青花與微塵同樣寳貴，謂清末文人崇尙此品，苟遇此石，必以石板襲藏，不願雕琢，至冬瓜瓤則僅視爲中品，與石花菜形之芋紋等，又日人坂東氏謂：石華作硯史時，僅</p>
<p>列玫瑰紫青花於次等，後其覆友人王鶴舟書，則稱玫瑰紫爲水歸洞獨有之名材，應列於諸青花之上，則可知愛硯之風尙，優劣之批評，卽在一時間亦有所不同矣。</p>

<h3>紐約股市稍見進展</h3>
<p>新豐洋行據華爾街日報報告云、昨日紐約證劵交易所市面仍屬閒散、惟因合衆冶金之營業報告異常優良、銀派繼續活動、及有未能證實之謠言稱金價將漲、故市况稍有進展、大投機家及羣衆仍多旁觀、靜待勞資糾紛之結果及管理交易所案之發展、小交易所市况隨金礦股挺進、美國公債頗有抛出、蓋受金價之謠言影響、而同時持票人深恐白銀案製成法律、人心頗感不安、具投機性之債劵回高、外國公債鬆軟、又據代理人報告云、（證劵）有良好需要、因罷工行將延期、而管理交易所案有再加修改之象、（小麥）商業略有進步、西南與西北愈旱、華盛頓消息較前順利、切勿抛空、（棉花）市面入停頓狀態、靜待各方發展、外國抛出、廠方於下跌時買進、工潮擴大、有人謂南方紗廠亦將罷工、而贊成恊作與强制减少棉田二派之意見愈見紛歧、紗布市况呆滯、買者之需要逐漸增加、最近因多方脫手、市塲地位業已進步、惟市價高漲猶待目下情勢之變更也、全日成交一百零二萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數左列、</p>

<h3>糧食浮多出擋粉價下落</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後近遠月一致趨下、因連日市價步漲、較月初低價已大起七八分至近角不等、奈何並無引起實在之去化、反造一般囤買之機會、故晨間開價後、卽有各方囤套浮多趁機出檔、廠方雖無抛出、亦乏收進、惟投機家興味尙濃、多頭回出外亦有空頭抵捕、全日共計成交三十二萬包、在近日交易清淡之際、尙稱熱閙、但終以出多進少、午後買户更呆、因此遠期多見空拍、收市價本月小二分、下月小二分七五、五月小二分半、六七月小一分半、八月小一分七五</p>
<h3>麥市期疲現挺</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、洋麥出入甚微、標麥開市後近期有多頭售出、且粉市下跌、人心趨下、三四月份一致步落、遠期尙有新買過問、最後收市三月小五分、四月小四分、七月大一分、八月大二分、現麥到銷兩活、市亦微挺、計開山東麥三元六角二分、瑤灣三元六角、蚌埠三元五角二分、臨淮三元五角四分、明光頴州三元五角七分、共計三千包、由福新辦去、</p>
<h3>蘇同南港米再跌五分</h3>
<p>北市常帮粳因有糾葛未斛</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、六千餘石、晚稻占多數、厚粳則小半、銷塲較懈、形勢初市未見佳象、本街作客寥寥、僅客帮稍動、售方處此環境設施、殊難週轉、若欲扳緊、又慮剩貨、反祇得喊平、南北洋兩帮方起而進貨、厦門等帮注意楓涇西練南港中關晚稻威海衛天津等帮楝取青角松江較高貨品、數共二千餘包、吃盤問題、聞客帮莊客俱制於來電限價、故市下贬四五分、各帮厚粳店胃旣滯、又受大局看軟、市色庶不黯淡、蘇同南港等貨行情下垂五分、僅常帮粳獨以貨乏、卓立原盤、杜洋尖賴到銷融合、未見榮辱、陰變元去路雖不廣、而以貨稀市色又見轉緊、惟價格無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨來源二十餘號、市上各色去胃仍呆、市形白粳薄稻客秈陰元白元均形平疲、當帮因事糾葛停市、</p>
<h3>南北貨蘭花子續到十批</h3>
<p>丨碼元肉昨到三　丨</p>
<p>蘭花子前到之貨、開出四十八元後、因存底早罄、市勢甚　、昨聞太古公司臨安輪運到一批、祇存二十　、當卽見樣、　乎色　　卵　買、故難善沽元、</p>
<p>石碼新元肉來源久缺、近銷活潑、昨日臨安輪運到三箱、當時見樣色亮辦大、堪稱上選、隨卽以九十七元成交、後貨如不多到、市看穩定、</p>
<h3>五傘英美馬口鐵定價都漲</h3>
<p>英美馬口鐵定價昨均報漲、英美九十磅每箱售十六先令二便士、比前好二便士、一百磅十七先令二便士、亦漲三便士美貨九十磅每箱四金冗三角七分、二百磅　　元九角、　好　二角、滬市因供過於求、同業對於定貨生意、均拖袖手旁觀態度、故未聞有購訂者</p>
<p>因缺趨漲之湖南純銻現貨　昨由漢口表到十餘噸、故市象前途又有一番熱閙也、</p>

<h3>讀「文學」的「繙譯專號」後</h3>
<p>— 余楊靈</p>
<p>昔人云：「老婆是人家的好，文章是自己的好」。看近幾年來讀書界的狀况，我們可以說是這樣：「文人是外國的好，但文章是本國的好」。</p>
<p>高爾基，蕭伯訥，羅曼羅蘭，巴比塞，紀德辛克萊……這些名字，以及和這些名字有關的事蹟，是很有人談起的，讀者呢，讀到這些名字，也莫不肅然起敬，恭維爲「文豪」。至於本國的文人呢，不少的是「無行」，有行的也决比不上外國作家那樣的偉大，這也是公認的事實。然而外國的文豪縱然偉大，他們的作品却没有人要讀，反之，本國的文人縱然「無行」，他們的文章仍然能够風行。</p>
<p>文人和文章的關係，在中國的讀者間，竟變得如此風馬牛，實在很可怪的。但這歷史實已很久，許多年前，徐志摩那樣的「詩哲」，早就讚賞了「呐喊」，而全然否定「呐喊」的作者的人格，至於托爾斯泰，杜思退益夫斯基，高爾基等久聞大名如雷灌耳的作家們的作品的譯本，二十年來仍復寥寥。</p>
<p>這原因，多數人說，正在於譯筆的不好，「直譯」「硬譯」之類是看不懂，「順譯」又不大可信，翻譯界還没有發明一種妥善的譯法：於是乎索性不看。至於本國文人的作品，無論好壞，首先就落得一個爽快，所以愛看的人總是多，尤其是把看文章當作全然消閑品的現在。</p>
<p>不論創作譯文，在今日無非商品，譯文這種商品旣無主顧，所以許多譯者也都擱筆了。在幾種雜誌的角角落落裏，偶而點綴着一兩篇譯文，恰如在北阮的紗羅錦綾旁邊掛着阮咸大布犢褌，不過是「未能免俗，聊復爾耳」。</p>
<p>然而，這回的「文學」雜誌却特出繙譯專號，而且志在「略示世界文學現狀之一斑，並期藉此引起關於翻譯諸問題之商討」。大有挽狂瀾於旣倒之意，這是近年來文壇上很可注意的一回事。世界文學與中國的關係，中國翻譯界的前途，都要看此舉的結果如何了。</p>
<p>我已讀完這專號，裏面包含十二國的作家，各種的體裁，一共二十篇文字。這二十篇不盡是世界文學中的甲選，但不見得比中國第一流作品壞些。至於譯筆，也都能使人看起來旣不費力而且覺得放心。我本想對每篇作一個批評，可惜不懂「……很好，但是……使人不能滿意，不過……還……除了……一點……至於……是很值得注意的。」這種流行的批評公式。</p>
<p>我只能總說一句，這二十篇文字，不一定會使你覺得毫無缺點，但也决不會使你一無所得。而尤可注意的，是「論壇」中關於翻譯的許多意見。</p>
<p>接着這專號，「文學」還要出「創作專號」。倘先看了這專號，再看下期的專號，那麽，對於世界文學及翻譯的問題將有更深的認識罷。</p>
<h3>浴乎沂風乎舞雩</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>現在，早已有人主張以半部「論語」治天下了！這話，在過去，我是相信的。因爲，那時候先生所敎我的齊家治國平天下之道總不出乎「四書」，而「大學」「中庸」和「孟子」實不過是曾子，子思，孟子祖述孔子之意，自然要以紀錄孔子自身底聖言聖行的「論語」爲代表了，其實，在我自身就不大喜歡以那些言行作爲標凖來正心修身達到那最初的階梯。不過，還記得有幾句話却是令我心折過的，那就是丨丨</p>
<p>「暮春者，春服旣成，冠者五六人，童子六七人，浴乎沂，風乎舞雩，詠而歸」這一段。</p>
<p>當我每次讀到這里的時候，我就覺得先生口中的孔子實在靠不住；孔孔子並不是一個道貌岸然，不可嚮邇的人，至少他没有像我底先生那樣古板，專門禁止學生們下河洗澡和沿途呼唱，因而我也就很厭怨我底古板的先生了。同時，在我底心中更有一種企望隨着那個厭怨一天一天地長大：我只希望有一個浴乎沂風乎舞雩的機會，使我能够實際親身領略着那種况味。</p>
<p>到了兩年以前，我總算是得着這一個機會了。當我剛到曲阜的第三天，趁着學校還没有開課的閒暇，便同幾位同事到舞雩臺去觀風。那時還是寒冷的正月天氣，誰也不願眞的去風一下，故只說是去觀。據說，舞雩臺是魯國時候舉行土舞的地方。住在曲阜的人，大約無論對於那一個所謂古蹟名勝的地方都愛說是由魯國來的或孔子又曾經在這里怎樣，我到不一定就相信這個據說，自然亦不容易因此而發生出分外的興趣。這台，名義上雖說是台，其實是一個小丘，小得像一個墳背那樣大。上面立着一道碑，像一個豎着的無蓋的匣子，也像一口豎着的無蓋的棺材，版上的字已經不大看得清楚了。旁邊有一株古老的但又是矮小的什麽樹，其餘的地方却完全秃着，差不多連小樹都找不出幾棵。周圍盡是些麥地，要走捷徑還須得從青青的麥地中穿過，倘若不是說它有名的話，我想就是在此過路的人要想息一口氣也只會坐在麥隴之上而不會再到那上面去的。這樣，所謂「乘興而來，敗興而去」的話便成爲我們當日底眞的寫照了。</p>
<p>後來，已是暑期臨頭的時候，還是因了一種好奇心底鼓動，又約了幾位同事到沂水去洗澡。順着南門出城，一片坦然的品疇和兩旁夾植着樹的小溪，首先就有點令人神往，一心以爲沂水一定是「清且漣漪」地在等着我們，不久便可以溶入它底懷中了。走了許多時間，轉了許多周折，才到達自己所嚮往的沂水，哪知道竟使人大失所望。淺淺的河身，靜靜的河水，旣不寛廣，亦不清深，簡直不能入浴。但别的同事們却早已先行跳下水去了，一陣兒時的玩笑又重現在我底眼前，只得連忙解衣脫履縱身下去。水到是温温的，最大的好處還在久擾不混，原來那下面是未含泥土的細沙，所以看起來似乎很濁，其實是很清的。大家都用那細沙擦身，我也照樣施行，覺得是要比一般的沙子柔滑一點。隨着起了岸後，他們還是用那岸上的乾沙濯足，而且就用那乾沙將足擦乾直接穿上鞋襪！這到令我有點奇異，當時我才知道到這里來洗澡是通行這樣幹的。於是我高興極了，馬上又乘興跑到舞雩臺去。</p>
<p>這次重到舞雩臺，却不再像前次那樣地敗興了。凉風軟軟地撲到臉上，使人馬上感到「南風之薰兮，可以解吾民之愠兮，」這兩句話底親切。那時候，眞可說是樂而忘憂，完全領略了，「浴乎沂風乎舞雩」的眞味。</p>
<h3>兩頭船</h3>
<p>— 莩</p>
<p>——　浙東民歌</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>長睫毛，黑眼睛，</p>
<p>惹人煩惱動人憐；</p>
<p>兩頭船上跨一脚，</p>
<p>那頭重來那頭輕？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>白貝齒，紅櫻唇，</p>
<p>看似無情又有情；</p>
<p>兩頭船上跨一脚，</p>
<p>那頭浮來那頭沈？</p>
<h3>「舊皮囊不能裝新酒」</h3>
<p>— 猛克</p>
<p>在中國，期刊和雜誌不必說，就是日報吧，消路上了土萬的，恐怕也不過兩三種。這就明白的證實：看得懂報，買</p>
<p>得起報的國民，也就不過這許多。這也總算得是中國的一種特色，鑿穿說，則其實是　可　得　一種　　了。</p>
<p>前些年，確實有人提倡過「識字運動」，現在是，大家似乎「談也不要談起」。這原因，我想，一半是「五四運動」的那些自以爲前進的敎育家們，現在大半都忙得很，有的要奔走國事，有的要出席國際什麽學會，有的，有的還要深入山林，賦詩飲酒，說笑話，編書信，實在無暇顧到「這個」。</p>
<p>但是，中國的國民中的不認識字，丨丨其實也無法認識字的國民，却也還在無意中受着一種敎育的，單就大都市說，在馬路的水門汀上，在衖堂的鐵門口，就常常可看見一些很不像人樣子的漢</p>
<p>子和小孩，圍着看「連環圖畫」。他們從直覺的美術上，去滿足他們的求知慾了。於是他們滿腦子，都是皇帝和神仙。迷信和奴隷的思想，至今也還是死死的纒住了他們的心。</p>
<p>不過近來因幾個雜誌上討論一個文學上的什麽問題，不覺也引起了一兩位眞肯爲大衆敎育着想的作家，由文字而注意到美術上的這「連環圖畫」，想要提倡一種改良「連環圖畫」的運動了，這實在是很可喜的。但也就有人提出異議，以爲「舊皮囊不能裝新酒」，應該從新「創造」一種美術上的敎育新工具。最近上海的有些日報上，是確已有人在創造新形式的「連環圖畫」了，。但是，那嘗試的效果是很有趣的，不是弄得「知識階級認爲非藝術，而大衆仍然看不懂」，就是弄得不但大衆看不懂，連知識階級</p>
<p>也看不懂。自然，我們不能單就這一點經騐，就下問題的結論，但單從這裏，我們也就得到了一個敎訓了：就是在舊社會未撤底改革之前，想要卽刻改變一種風氣和習慣，是極其艱難的，我們只能盡可能的利用它，慢慢的轉變它。所以在目前，由事實的敎訓，我以爲我們對於「連環圖畫」的舊形式，仍須有條件的接受過來，盡可能的參進新的思想去</p>
<p>由此，可知在文學上，有條件的利用爲小市民所較歡迎的章回小說的舊形式</p>
<p>，也未必不是同樣的緊要問題了。</p>
<p>總之是，關於這一類問題，凡是還肯眞替大衆敎育着想的人們，實在有重行提起來討論的必要。</p>

<h3>西行雜記（五）</h3>
<p>— 魯彥</p>
<p>車過鄭州後，不復是沙原，兩邊的低地，澗溝，漸漸多了起來，但雖是澗溝，可並没有水，現在都是人行，或車行的</p>
<p>道路。我們的車子不時在低矮的山岡間走着。兩旁的樹木很多。高而且直的白楊接連的轟</p>
<p>立着。隨後山岡漸漸高了，澗谷愈加低了，車子也開得慢了。上下左右一個一個的洞穴，這便是現代住的古屋。他們住着這樣的地方，穿着破爛的衣服，吃着黑麵包，而勞作所得，還須供給官兒的水門汀，</p>
<p>絲綢，西餐，汽車和一切奢侈品。</p>
<p>路愈走愈難了，車子時常傾仄着，軌旁不時出現幾十丈深的澗溝。開車的眞像如臨深淵似的開着特别慢車，戰戰兢兢地輕輕地走了過去。拖過了一大半車廂，便突然開着快車，怕後面的車廂落下坑去，要不管死活的把牠拖過來一樣，兩邊的山阜呼呼地呌着，帮着他的忙。車子又不時嗚嗚呌着，宏隆隆隆的進了黑暗的山洞，過了一個又一個，到洛陽一共十一個。</p>
<p>在車上，遠遠地看見白馬寺，又看見一個陵墓的遺址，問人家，說是漢獻帝的。車進洛</p>
<p>陽界，一路看到高的墓碑，大約氏下都是過去的大小官兒的家墓。田野中，像水缸大，脚盆大的，面盆大的隆起着的土堆，便是老百姓的墳墓了。再過幾年，這些水缸大的將變成脚盆一樣大；脚盆大的將戀成面盆一樣大；而面盆大的則將鋤爲平地，上面種起東西來，再也認不出了。爲了土地的生產，這是對的。倘若每一個死了的人都像故鄉的習俗似的或</p>
<p>像這裏貴人的辦法，則多少年以後，可種植的地面漸漸狹窄起來，世界將是一個眞正的墓地了。人生是一料沙。永久在那裏呢？</p>
<p>一個在洛陽下車的旅客告訴我說，洛陽的蒼蠅會咬人，把牠打死了，居然會發現血出來。我說，怕是牛蠅那一類的東西吧？但他說不是，而是普通的蒼蠅。我覺得奇怪。</p>
<p>洛陽以西，常常看到一種松柏一類的樹木，牠的樹葉，一直生到樹榦的脚跟。據說趙匡胤到潼關去的時候，恐怕回來不認得路，一路在樹榦的下端紮上草，因此以後就變成了這</p>
<p>樣的樹木。</p>
<p>從洛陽到潼關又過了十四五個山洞，以硤石驛一個最長，過了　寳後便隨時可以看見黃</p>
<p>河。峭幽之險，這樣的地方，現在總算經過了。雖然車子走的是新開的平路，但也够險了。只是有一點使我失望的，一路全是不毛的土山幾乎連一塊小石也不容易看見，而那顏色，旣不是紅黃的，也不是黑的，却是没有生氣的近黃不黃，近白不白的土。而且牠鬆得隨時可以前下來，正如人的生命一樣。</p>

<h3>遺書（四）</h3>
<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>依娜在席卓雲的辦公室内。</p>
<p>「很好；你寫好了，謝謝你。」</p>
<p>「不曉得要那一期才能發表？」</p>
<p>「今天是星期一丨星期三是來不及了，早已付了稿；星期六也來不及了。我想下星期三丨我已同何介穆商量過了，請他把他的小說暫作一個小結束，好發表你的。讓我再對他說一聲；下星期三我想可以了，至多再隔一期，到下星期六。」</p>
<p>「發表費年内可以全部拿到嗎？」躊躇了一兩秒鐘，終於這樣問了出來。</p>
<p>「你也等錢用？」笑着，不信任似地。</p>
<p>她微笑地點了點頭。</p>
<p>「只要在年内能發表一兩期就可以了，而在年内是可以發表的，」卓雲不遲疑地說。</p>
<p>「我還想把版權費去，可以嗎？」</p>
<p>「可以的。」</p>
<p>「能不能當時拿錢？」</p>
<p>「大概不成問題丨汪仲華，也是爲中秋節要錢用，來把他的「寒宵」的版權賣去，十三來說，十四就拿到錢了。」</p>
<p>「那末，謝謝你，請你去說一說。」</p>
<p>「可是，最好請代寫一封信給我，寫着要賣去版權的事情；我有了這封信，去說起來，方便些。」</p>
<p>依娜答應過一兩天把寫好了的信送給他。</p>
<p>把信送去後的兩三天，依娜打一個電話給席卓雲，問他出版部的回音怎樣。卓雲說，回音還没有來，只是「生之味」已决定從下星期六開始發表。她知道下星期六是二十日，從那一期</p>
<p>發表起，年内還有三期可發表，只要能拿到發表费，卽使版權一時賣不去，也没有多大的關係，因此她的心中還不怎樣不安。</p>
<p>那命定的星期六到了，依娜一醒就要李媽把當天的新聞紙拿給她，她急忙翻尋新書廣告，她翻到了文藝半月刊，可是在目錄中没有「生之味」，它的作者的名字，陳依娜，並没顯露絲毫的踪影。</p>
<p>她的心中急跳着。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>滬市存銀五億六千萬</h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>最近中國銀行經濟研究室發表滬市存銀共五億六千萬元，内中存於華商銀行者佔二億八千餘萬元，存於外商銀行者佔二億七千餘萬元。查中國全國存銀不過十餘億元（前見某處統計，似係十二三億元，不知有無錯誤，但大概是此數），而上海一埠，卽佔總數百分之四十强；而此百分之四十强之中，外商銀行又佔去二分之一稍弱。這眞是一個可驚的比率。</p>
<p>中國經濟何以會發現此種畸形的形態呢？無疑的，那就是内地農村破產，現銀集中於都市，致形成如於臃腫之象。這是一般人常識都知道的了。</p>
<p>然則滬市如此巨額存銀，其唯一的用途又是那一方面呢？這裏我們來看上海各銀行營業狀况。據申報年鑑；民國二十年度上海銀行公會會員中央銀行等二十八家銀行營業概况，各銀行總計資產額爲二十五億零三百六萬，内中有價證劵就佔二億三千四百七十六萬七千元。這資額雖對總資產額不算怎樣大，但就各資產部門比率觀，也就可驚了。此外還有鉅額的地產投資。至於放欵額，雖有十五億多點，但這十五億放欵大部是投入那一部門的呢？因我們没有看到以上各銀行的營業分類表，不能斷定。但大概總不是大部投入生產部門，這是一定的。這只要看近年我國民族工業的危機，就可知穩健的銀行家們决不肯以有用的金錢投之於危險的地域的，那末大部分資產只有用之於投機事業了。從這一點，我們又可看到，中國近年經濟，不獨是農村破產，而且都市中的生產企業，也已如何地臨到了没落的地位。</p>
<p>滬市存銀百分之五十存在於外國銀行，這裏所說明的，便是中國經濟，整個是殖民地的經濟；而且這殖民地經濟的程度，只有一年一年加深。全國的經濟命脈，差不多全操在外國銀行手裏，所謂華商銀行，只不過仰其鼻息而已。</p>
<p>不獨華商銀行要仰外商銀行鼻息，而且外商銀行還直接進而支配了中國整個的政治。政治擊於經濟，這是一定的。誰有錢誰就能操縱誰，外商銀行握有中國如此的經濟霸權，他焉有不進而影響到政治之理？事例極多，這裏也不必一一細舉了。</p>
<p>外商銀行所以保有中國的如此鉅額存銀，這是那裏來的呢？無疑的，都出在我們百姓身上。間接地取之於中國農村外，還有中國大批的封建階級，買辦階級，把大批搜括得來的人民脂膏，爲求其「安全」起見，都存入了外國銀行。這樣，外國銀行便益發富足有餘了。</p>
<p>農村是極度地破產，民族工業是臨到了最後的危機，全中國所有現金，都集中於都市，而半數則流入於外國銀行（更大批的流出外洋），華商銀行則以此項大部分都市游資都投之於證劵地產及其他投機事業，試問其結果將怎樣呢。</p>
<h3>我是這末的年青呵</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>我是這末的年青呵！</p>
<p>依我的年紀講，我還不配做靠着嗓子過活的小學敎員；可是，誰料不到我</p>
<p>已經當了二整年了。</p>
<p>粉筆的粉末兒將要埋葬了我的青春呵！</p>
<p>有一次，六年級裏有個比我高大得多的小朋友在敎室裏誠摯地問我：</p>
<p>「王先生可是中學畢業的？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「王先生多大年紀了？看來多麽青呀！」他的面部表情告訴了我他是何等地羡慕我呵！</p>
<p>睫毛再也關不住我的淚泉丨我突然哭了。</p>
<p>滿敎室的小朋友都驚訝了起來，都在輕輕地互相探問着我哭的原因丨誰會知道呵。</p>
<p>有一位小朋友起來責問那起先問我的那位小朋友：</p>
<p>「你什麽話兒得罪了王先生啊？」</p>
<p>靜靜的丨靜靜的……</p>
<p>一雙脚步兒的聲音移到了我的跟前，囁嚅的話兒向着我耳裏送：</p>
<p>「王先生；我什麽話兒得罪了王先生，你儘責罰我……你儘責罰我……」</p>
<p>想不到他也哭起來了。</p>
<p>我推他去，哽咽着對他們說：</p>
<p>「没有什麽話兒呵！我想起了這末年青，我就會哭起來了。」</p>
<p>從此，小朋友們在我面前再不敢提起年青的話兒。</p>
<p>我是這末的年青呵！</p>
<p>粉筆的粉末兒要埋葬我的青春呵！</p>
<p>又一次，我望着操塲上的幾個幼稚園裏的小寳寳跳繩子丨活潑潑地，做滿二個，就數一數：</p>
<p>「二！四！六！八！十！……」</p>
<p>多濃趣兒呵！</p>
<p>我走過去：</p>
<p>「好寳寳！我也來，好不好？」</p>
<p>幾個小寳寳瞅了瞅我，笑笑，搖搖頭，說：</p>
<p>「不來，不來！我們來不過你的，你是先生呀！」</p>
<p>想不到他們拖着繩子兒跑了。</p>
<p>我回過身來，「你是先生呀」這句話在我心頭进；回到自己的臥室裏，扶伏在枕上，又哭了。</p>
<p>兒童的隊伍裏再也擠不進去啦。</p>
<p>可是，我是這末的年青呵！</p>
<p>粉筆的粉末兒要埋葬了我的青春呵！</p>

<h3>處世一課</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>商業，我無以名之。要說吧，那就是爛汚貨也爭做是好貨買，是豬婆肉也爭做是好豬肉，這便是所謂商業。</p>
<p>本來有許多東西便總是這樣的，没有實際地鑽入那百物的核心，便總不知道這東西的好壞。這原因是由於許多事物有它各種不同異常美麗的外容。通常一般没有銳利眼光的人們，便總是不能看出這事物的好壞的。</p>
<p>於是這裏便需要所謂中介者了。在文藝方面講便需要所謂批評家。很顯然地這種中介者和批評家的任務，便是秉承着他的銳利的眼光把那實際的情形告訴我們。譬如這杯茶是苦的，實在吃不得。這樣一來我們自然是會退避了。</p>
<p>不過這會惹惱着人家。而且這種事若是發展下去，是一定會消滅商業的。</p>
<p>惹惱着人家和消滅着商業兩般都是不好的。做人總得做個處處討好的人。茶是苦的，讓人家喝去：明明是豬婆肉，讓人家買去，頂多不過心裏彷彿有些難過，至於實際是不得招惹眞正的敵人。要是自己聰明點的人，不但不去揭破這苦茶的實情，反而到處宣傳着某處的茶葉好，人生一世若不去買點來喝一喝是什麽都不值得。亭樣一來自己不但是不化一文錢也會有茶喝，而且那茶商主人是更會給你一點外快的。</p>
<p>是這樣，當然是最懂得處世了。一方面商業旣可發達，再一點自己也可以闊綽起來。</p>
<p>這種的人，四萬萬同胞中大概不少吧。不過有些人行動雖然行得蠻像蠻慣，却於理論還有點糢糊，所以我特花點時間，把它撰述一遍，聊冀有心人垂擇采焉。</p>
<h3>心境素描</h3>
<p>— 柳岸</p>
<p>去年彭家皇因病而死，文藝界替他開追悼會的時候，俺心想，一個與生活苦鬥的人也就終於打了敗仗死去，人生的路上也實在難走；後來朱湘投水自殺，雜誌替他出專號，俺心裏又想，一個戰不過生活壓迫的人，竟至於自殺，一方面固然表現着勇敢，一方面也就表現着懦弱，人生究竟是應該勇敢地生活下去才對。這兩人之死，並不激動俺心海的波浪。今年艾霞服藥自殺，報上追悼不停，俺也只是說一聲，人對於生活太認眞，也只有自殺這一條路讓他走。近來忽然也有讚美自殺的念頭，其動機却連自己都莫名其妙。深夜裏，在床上沉思，對自己分析一下，覺得心境是實在起了變化。</p>
<p>說是因爲政治的苦悶而消沉起來吧？可是這一種消沉的心境也不是現在才發住的，說近一點是在去年，說遠一點那就已經在三年前的事了。去年宣布不聞問政治，這是公開的事，三年前出版一本小說集都是一些虚無主義的作品，人家不注意吧了。心进的消沉，並不够證明讚美自殺的念頭的由來，這是顯然的事。</p>
<p>老漁翁連聲向打手求饒，可是已被打得頭破血流了，兩個少年漁人見他可憐，才從丁家門口扛着他走回去。他們一路只是冷冷地嘆着氣；一點也不曾想到要怎樣去反抗壓迫！</p>
<h3>打魚殺家</h3>
<p>— 猛</p>
<p>蕭恩和女兒打魚到晚，便一路歸家；鄰居的漁人一遇着佢們便以老漁翁因欠魚稅被打事告知！腿被打傷一大塊；耳門被打得流了許多的血。蕭恩聽了嘆道：「窮人眞太難做了！」</p>
<p>然而，也有讚美自殺的念頭，却並不想自殺，反而渴念着要生活下去，無論如何都要生活下去，對於死覺得戰憟，這是矛盾，也是比較想要自殺更爲可怕的事。清夜細想，分析起來，這是俺已經有了老人的心所致。照年齡來說正在壯年，現在已經有了老人的心，人生於我究竟要俺說出什麽希望來了呢？</p>
<p>老人不願意死，因此世界上没有自殺的老人；可是老人對於生活不認眞，馬馬虎虎活下去，這才是令人悚然以懽的事。俺的心境現在如此變化，大概是一切完了的預兆，嗚呼！</p>
<h3>老漁翁</h3>

<h3>願來世化爲男兒身</h3>
<p>— 頎萍</p>
<p>做人難，做女人更難，雖然有人以爲女人處處佔點便宜，其實這不過是膚淺之談，觀乎我們的老牌明星王漢倫女士被其夫君以脚垢鼻涕相餉，就可知做女人之不容易了。</p>
<p>蘋果臉，櫻桃唇，干卿底事？眼如秋波，腰如楊柳，此皆天之所生，我豈好妖也哉！何勞墨客騷人，搦其生花之筆，展紙濡毫，亦譏亦誚地横也女人，豎也女人，雪月風花大做其四六文章，摩登哥兒們則又盈篇累牘的妹妹呀！心肝呀！的綴些香艷詩句，肉　得令人肉顫，這樣似乎没有女人就做不出文章而要做文章却斷斷少不了女人，這且不提，更有些荒唐得出乎意外的，甚而至於把中國滅族的事都一股腦兒推到女人身上，什麽紂是亡於妲已，周是亡於喪姒講董卓無疑地被貂嬋害死，而最近東三省之喪失，也好像爲了某女士的擠眉弄眼以致把我們的少將樂得熱辣辣的連了偌大的三千萬方里土地怎樣斷送，自己</p>
<p>也有些莫明其妙！啊！如此不分皂白，公然侮辱我女界同胞，眞使我粥粥羣雌，跳黃浦之江而無以自明！</p>
<p>機關中，馬路裏，上至西裝革履的體面先生，下至粗脚大手的販夫走卒，引得唾沫四飛津津有味的也無非女人，誰家的姑娘眉毛兒濃，誰家的姑娘大腿兒白，似乎捨此以外，就無話可說，本來，女人在男人的心目中，原是一件玩物，他們歡喜你時就會姐兒長姐兒短的殷勤得使你有些不大相信，等到玩得滑腻了，那末不容說是掉頭不顧而去，陌路蕭郎，滔滔皆是而少女的貞操，全是在這不知不覺中毁滅了的，危矣哉！女人之不易爲也！</p>
<p>女人，女人自有其不可磨滅的功績存在，何物孔老夫子，膽敢大放厥詞什麽：「惟女人與小人爲難養也」出言却如此荒謬，不但侮辱了他的媽媽，簡直侮辱了我四海之内的姊妹唾們，大概他老先生一定情塲失意，或者至少受過女人的白眼，於是一股怨氣，壓不下去，乃咬文嚼字，想出這樣誣蔑的話來，作報復的手段。</p>
<p>先前呢！女子祇有困守閨門，不許出門外一步，好好的一雙天足硬要紮得像竹簡那樣的，一　一　才能傳得偷夫們的一笑，現在雖然說是解放了，同樣地能在社會上辦事，然而除了得到一個花瓶的美銜外，其他還有什麽？啊！生而不幸爲女子，更生而不幸爲中國的女子！</p>
<p>絲羅帳中，錦繡被裏，魂消眞個，則大家有份，然而一待孽根種下，我則大腹便便，多少不雅，而臨盆時則又肝腸如製，誠如古人所謂：「產婦一脚在棺材之内一脚在棺材之外」，一不湊巧，就有香消玉殒之虞，但是被傖儘可逍遙事外，重度其枯花染柳的生活，天下不公平的事，捨此其將誰屬？</p>
<p>今生已矣，來者可追，但願來世化</p>
<p>個白白凈凈清清秀秀年少風流漢，則庶幾矣，阿彌陀佛！</p>
<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>故鄉瑣紀</p>
<p>吃過夜飯，在堂屋裏坐地。煤油燈光照着三個廳大可怕的影子，孩子在妻懷中睡熟了，但妻的手還有一下没一下的拍着他，嘴裏哼着自己都聽不清楚的鼻音。媽捧着水烟袋抽烟，抽完了一根紙吹換一根。她心中或者也感到兒子媳婦孩子團聚在家中的歡樂丨丨心的深處的歡樂，因爲她永遠没有笑臉給别一個人瞧見的，她是那樣歇司底里地獨自居住在這破舊的老屋裏。我坐在燈光下，翻讀當天的報紙，我從没有那般細心的讀報，况且這又是早上翻過的報紙。我心中矛盾地一半依戀着這破舊的老屋，一半想到明天這時候又投進我第二故鄉的上海懷中來。</p>
<p>風在屋頂上吹過，屋頂同時也是一陣嚮。如其在半夜裏，一定疑惑這屋子會倒下來。然而二天來我已經習慣了，母親當然更是習慣了的，牠一陣陣的呼號，並没有引起我們中任何一個人的注意，一切保持着沉默，除了妻的哼調。那煤油燈忽然被紙窗中吹來的風幌了幌</p>
<p>，墻壁上三個廳大的影子也跟着搖動。妻打了個哈欠，像對着孩子說：「去睡罷。」各人似乎都等待着這句話似的伸腰的伸腰，打哈欠的打哈欠。母親捧着水烟袋站起身說：「早點睡罷，明天要趕早車的。」她雖是那樣說，眼珠却望着屋頂，像遲疑地想着什麽事；或者就是「你們再住一天走罷。」無論當初是痛恨澈骨的敵人，在分别了一個長時間以後，多少會感到有再做朋友的可能；而况倒底是個名義上的兒子，也達到了要個小孩子來抱抱的希望，說起來應該是個多末福氣的太太；但是四五年没有歸來的兒子，很快的又離别去了。人倒底是情感的，尤其是個中年的婦人，她當然知道不久的將來便是白髮斑斑的老婦人了。她一個人住在這破舊的老屋里，她能不想起從前做姑娘的時代，新婚後的甜蜜時期，死去了自己二個兒子的悲哀，以及許多年來獨自住着這屋子的悽凉嗎？她眼珠停留在屋項上，或者就是在想着過去嗎？我悽然的站起身來「媽，睡罷，時候不早了。」我自己也不明白說出這麽話來，實在是早得無可再早的時候，相一　五時半的電影還没有散塲哩。</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying Has Indeed Left the Army</h3>
<p>Subordinate Officers Rebel One After Another, The Situation Is Over</p>
<p>Sun Leaves the Army to Dengkou, Accompanied by Fu Zhankui to Ping</p>
<p>Remnants Monitored by Troops Dispatched by Fu and Ma, Awaiting Reorganization</p>
<p>The Military Campaign Against Sun Can Be Declared Complete</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhankui's 23rd Telegram to Ping reports that Sun Dianying arrived in Dengkou at 5 PM on the 22nd, preparing to go to Ping with him on the 23rd. After receiving the telegram, He Yingqin immediately telegraphed to Fu Zuoyi, saying that if Sun left the army to go to Ping, he could be allowed to pass through the defense area of the Jin-Sui Army. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Jin-Sui Army occupied Dengkou, they coordinated with the Ning Army to attack Sun's troops from both sides. Ding Futing, Lü Cunyi, Lu Fengnian, and other units within Sun's army rebelled one after another. Because Sun was unable to fight, and suing for peace would mean losing credibility, he led a part of his guards on the 20th, forcefully collaborating with Zhuan Sunziyu's brigade to attack Pingluo, intending to use it as a base. However, because the Ma army in the city held firm, Sun knew that the matter could not be accomplished. That night, he left the army. After Sun left the army, his remnants were temporarily monitored by troops dispatched by Fu and Ma, awaiting orders for reorganization. The Jin-Sui Army and Ning Army units are still advancing towards Pingluo. The military campaign against Sun can be declared complete in the coming days. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin received a telegram from Men Bingyue this morning, stating that Sun Dianying had left the army on the 20th due to the disintegration of his troops, and his whereabouts were unknown. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed on the 20th, saying that after Kuiyuan left his post, the Yu, Liu, and Ding units under his command had complied with the Beiping Military Branch Council's order of the 5th. The Yu unit moved to the Hedong area of Ningxia, the Ding unit moved to the area near Ningxia, and the Liu unit moved to the western Sui area, awaiting review. Kuiyuan left the troops on the 17th and arrived in Dengkou on the 20th, accompanying the Fu and Li representatives of the Military Branch Council, and would go to Ping immediately. At this time of national crisis, he would serve the country as a citizen in the future. Respectfully telegraphed for your consideration. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sui telegram, Fu Zhankui telegraphed Ping early on the 23rd, reporting that Sun Dianying had indeed left the army and gone into retirement, and was currently in Dengkou, preparing to come east together. Most of Sun's troops collapsed and fled north of Dengkou. The siege of Pingluo has been lifted. The Second Brigade of Ma Hongkui's troops occupied Shizuishan, and Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry was pursuing them. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe telegram, Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengzhou arrived in Dengkou at noon on the 21st to supervise and urge the various units to actively advance. The Lü cavalry brigade would reach the vicinity of Shizuishan at noon on the 22nd. The Wang Tingying infantry brigade passed Dengkou at Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 22nd, marching at full speed towards Shizuishan. Sun Changsheng, Tian Shumei, Jin Zhonghe, and other brigades were also advancing one after another, aiming to actively pressure Sun's troops and resolve the situation as soon as possible. Lu Fengnian immediately rebelled and obeyed the central government. In this way, the Jin-Sui Army's occupation of Shizuishan would not lead to a major battle. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ningxia telegram, a brigade of Ning Army cavalry and the Zhao Chengzhou cavalry of the Jin-Sui Army jointly occupied Shizuishan on the afternoon of the 22nd. The remnants of Sun's troops collapsed and retreated north of Dengkou. Sun himself arrived in Dengkou last night. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui occupied Shizuishan yesterday, and the siege of Pingluo has been lifted. Seeing that the situation was over, Sun arrived in Dengkou yesterday afternoon and met with Fu, looking dejected. He intended to leave the army to go to Ping with Fu. He also dispatched staff officer Tao Jun from Ping this afternoon to Sui to work with Men Bingyue and Fu Zuoyi to handle the aftermath of Sun's army. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Men Bingyue telegraphed Ping, saying that Sun expressed his willingness to leave the army, but the aftermath of his troops had not yet been negotiated. Therefore, he asked Fu to stay in Shizuishan for a few more days to discuss everything. After the arrangements were completed, Fu would return east, and Sun would go to Jin to stay for a while. Sun's troops under Yu Shiming would be transferred to Hedong in Ningxia, Liu Yueting's troops would be transferred to western Sui, and Ding Futing's troops would be transferred between Ningxia and Pingluo, awaiting reorganization. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Fengnian sent a cipher telegram to Ping last night, declaring his obedience to the central government. Whether his troops were reorganized or reduced, he was willing to obey orders. At the same time, he telegraphed Yan Xishan, Zhu Shaoliang, and Ma Hongkui to report, and telegraphed Sun, advising him to rein in at the edge of the cliff and avoid future regrets. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun owes money to the Baotou-Linhe area. After Fu was ordered by the Military Branch Council to investigate, he telegraphed Ping to confirm the facts. Sun intends to request the Military Branch Council to allocate the repayment from the three months of arrears in the troops' pay. However, the authorities have already allocated this money to the Jin-Sui Army for use. Since Sun has expressed his intention to leave the army, a meeting should be convened to discuss the repayment method. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe telegram, on the evening of the 18th, Sun's troops were still attacking Pingluo with all their might, and the situation was quite critical. The Ma Brigade Commander defending Pingluo telegraphed for help. The original telegram stated that the enemy troops used fierce artillery fire to attack our Yuhuang Pavilion and the northwest corner of the city at 7 PM, and our Ma and Yu battalion commanders were injured, with dozens of soldiers and many civilians killed and wounded. Please advance troops quickly in order to encircle and lift the siege of Pingluo. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fu arrived in Baotou and Linhe, he sent personnel to the families of the military officers stationed in the Baotou-Linhe area to convey the Military Branch Council's great intention of not investigating the past actions of Sun's military officers and providing them with preferential arrangements. The officers of Sun's army received reports from their families, so they sent representatives to Linhe to discuss surrendering (23rd telegram).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding Sun personally, the authorities have always adopted a lenient approach, hoping that Sun can come to live in Ping, and everything can still be absolutely guaranteed. The authorities also telegraphed this intention to Fu. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military officer said that the Jin-Sui Army's advance this time was greatly aided by the strength of Lu Fengnian's division. At the same time, because Sun's main force was divided to besiege Ningyuan and Pingluo, the troops were dispersed, and the siege had been going on for a long time, the soldiers' morale was flagging, so the progress could be so rapid. The Ningxia Ma Hongkui troops, in collaboration with the □ brigade of Hu Zongnan's division, began their northern attack at dawn on the 19th, and it went quite smoothly. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from the military that Lu Fengnian, the commander of Sun's 119th Division, had led his troops to rebel, had recently telegraphed the Military Branch Council, stating that Fengnian was a mere soldier and had long seen the disaster of internal strife that could not be allowed to rise again. Since receiving the central government's order on February 5th, he had intended to comply, so that the locality could be stabilized as soon as possible. However, he hoped that Military Commander Dianying could repent, and the entire army should take a unified attitude, which should not be expressed. Unexpectedly, even today, Military Commander Dianying still held his own views, so he had no choice but to take decisive action. On the 23rd, he led his troops to obey the central government, unable to harm the greater good for small matters, or abandon public benefit for private friendship. Whether this is appropriate, please issue clear instructions on the direction, etc. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Tonight, bandit Liu was surrounded by a large force at Daokou Pass, more than 60 li northwest of Jieshou in Changqing County. Han and Division Commander Sun Tongxuan, Brigade Commander Yun Qichang, have all arrived in Jieshou to supervise the troops and are vigorously suppressing them. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han mobilized troops to block the bandits at the four stations of Jieshou, Zhangxia, Gushan, and Wand, Sun Tongxuan went to Tai today to meet with Han. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Bandit Liu burned more than ten villages in Yuncheng and Wenshang, and massacred more than eighty people in Juye. Many of bandit Liu's troops have dispersed, and dozens have been captured in Jinan, Ningyang, and Yanzhou. (22nd Special Telegram)</p>

Feng pays great attention to bandit disturbances. Peng Guozheng, the commander of Feng's guard regiment, captured a mortar and dozens of prisoners while suppressing Liu in Anjiazhuang on the 22nd. Liu begged Han for leniency, willing to be reorganized. Han resolutely refused and is determined to suppress him to the end, eliminating the scourge for several provinces in North China. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng will go to Jinan tomorrow morning (23rd telegram).</p>
<h3>Observations on the Situation in North China Amidst Rumors</h3>
<p>No Changes Expected for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the situation in North China, there have been widespread rumors in the outside world in the past week that it is becoming tense again. According to sources concerned, the Japanese have now canceled special expenses for North China, and the units along the Great Wall have also returned to their normal state. The 10th and 14th Divisions in northern Manchuria have been ordered to be transferred back to their country, and the new replacement troops have not yet arrived. At the same time, the Japanese army is currently concentrating near cities with regiments as military units, actively training. In this way, no changes are expected for the time being. Although the Japanese army has increased troops in eastern Chahar, the problem in Chahar Province is also the entire problem of North China. If there are no plans for the entire North China for the time being, then no major problems are expected in Chahar Province at present. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Divide Pseudo-Army Forces by Military Region</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese ordered the cancellation of the garrison commands in various places in the Northeast, they have decided to start planning seven major military regions from April 1st, and limit the pseudo-army to be concentrated in each military region before July 1st. The Japanese are doing this purely to divide the pseudo-army forces, so that they will never rebel, and will take the opportunity to resolve them. (23rd Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Eastern Route Headquarters Moves from Xiamen to Zhangzhou</h3>

<h3>No Negotiations Conducted Before or After the Exchange of Notes Between the US and Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Department Insists on Changing the Ratio</p>
<p>US Navy Bill Sent to Roosevelt for Signature</p>
<p>Philippine Independence Bill Passed by US Congress</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the U.S. State Department sent a telegram to foreign envoys and consuls on the 21st to explain the unofficial exchange of letters between the United States and Japan. A translation is as follows: "The original text of the unofficial letters exchanged between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has been published in newspapers in Tokyo and Washington. No negotiations whatsoever have been conducted between the two governments prior to this, nor are any negotiations being conducted now." (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the exchange of documents between Hirota and Hull, the Ministry of the Navy issued the following opinion in the form of a conversation yesterday: "The morning editions of various newspapers on the 21st carried a telegram from London, saying that the empire would satisfy the current naval ratio in exchange for the revision of the anti-Japanese immigration law, recognition of "Manchukuo," and Philippine independence. However, this is contrary to the facts. The Imperial Navy is determined to revise the current naval ratio and has not changed in any way." (23rd Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate passed the 500 million yuan naval expansion appropriation bill today. This bill has now been sent to the President for signature. This bill was passed by the Senate on March 6, but a number of additional clauses were added, which were rejected by the House of Representatives. The bill was returned to the Senate for reconsideration two days ago, and it was passed in its original form today. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States' most advantageous naval bill has been passed by both houses of Congress and will be sent to the President for signature today. Congressional action on this bill has come to an end. When the Senate passed the additional clauses, opponents created obstacles to the vote on the committee report, but they were ultimately ineffective. The House of Representatives passed this bill this morning and sent it to the Senate. It is said that President Roosevelt will soon approve this bill, as the President believes that this bill will not only strengthen the United States' national defense but also create jobs for thousands of workers. The Vincent-Trammell Naval Act stipulates that the United States Navy will build 102 warships and 1,184 aircraft. The Senate's amendments to this bill were finally passed by the House of Representatives. The Senate's amendments limit the profits that private companies can make from building warships and aircraft to 10 percent, in order to avoid outsiders from profiting from the naval program. There are no specific regulations for the allocation of funds in this bill, but the funds required for shipbuilding in the future will be approved by Congress at any time.

<p>(Washington) The Philippine Islands Independence Bill, proposed by Democratic Senator Tydings and Representative McDuffie in reference to the President's message, was passed by the House of Representatives on the 19th of this month and transferred to the Senate. The Senate put it to discussion today, and as a result, it passed with a large majority of 68 votes to 8 votes. Before the vote, a number of amendments were proposed, the most important of which was Senator King's proposal to allow the Philippine Islands to be independent immediately, but it was not passed. According to the Independence Bill passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate before and after, it is stipulated that the Philippines will be completely independent within twelve years, organize a republic, and after the declaration of independence, the U.S. Army stationed in the Philippines should withdraw immediately, while the naval bases will be left to be resolved after independence.

<h3>Diplomatic Authorities' Observation on the Exchange of Notes Between the US and Japan</h3>
<p>Unlikely to be Recognized as an Organization</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Newspapers reported the exchange of diplomatic documents between the United States and Japan, and officials from various countries are paying close attention to this. A British newspaper even claimed that the United States might recognize the puppet state, etc. As this matter is of great importance to our country, the reporter went to ask a certain diplomatic authority. According to the discussion, the documents exchanged between the United States and Japan are of an informal nature, but since the full text has not yet been seen, there is no way to make an accurate judgment. However, based on observations at this time, the motive for the exchange of notes between the United States and Japan may be to ease the tense atmosphere between the United States and Japan over the past two years, and there is no other effect. This is evidenced by the U.S. State Department's telegram to its embassies abroad, stating that "no negotiations whatsoever have been conducted between the United States and Japan prior to this, nor are any negotiations being conducted now." This kind of observation may not be wrong. As for the claim of not recognizing the puppet organization, the U.S. government has repeatedly declared that it is its consistent policy, and the United States Minister to Switzerland formally replied to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations agreeing to the measures regarding non-recognition of the puppet state passed by the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations on June 7 last year. We firmly believe that the U.S. government will implement its consistent claims and will not recognize the existence of the puppet organization. (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain Decides Not to Recognize the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>If the Situation Changes, It Must Be Discussed by the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the reporter met with the British Minister this morning on the 23rd, he inquired about Britain's attitude towards the puppet organization. According to the Minister, Britain is a loyal member state of the League of Nations and will abide by the League's resolutions, will not recognize the puppet Manchukuo, and will not consider this issue. The reporter asked again whether Britain's attitude would change due to changes in the situation. The Minister continued, if the situation changes to the point where the League of Nations must consider the issue of recognition or non-recognition, the British government will also have to consider it.

<h3>US-Japan Negotiations Promote the Opening of the Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Commentary from the French Press</p>
<p>(Paris) The French press commented on the Washington negotiations. The French press believes that Japan's purpose is not only to discuss the Far East issue, but also the naval issue will be raised for discussion. When conducting naval negotiations, Japan will definitely demand that the United States recognize "Manchukuo," revise the U.S. immigration law, and abolish the U.S. naval and air bases in the Philippines as exchange conditions. The French side expects that the result of informal direct negotiations will be to promote the early opening of the Pacific Conference, which will be attended by all countries concerned about the Far East issue. (23rd World News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Far East Issue Has Become International in Nature</h3>
<p>Commentary from the Manchester Guardian</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian criticized the exchange of notes between the US and Japan today, saying that Japan's move was caused by the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov's gaining recognition from the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement that all countries related to the Far East have the right to discuss issues with each other is very important, as it is tantamount to registering the international nature of the Far East issue. According to the New York Times' Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese government believes that the future status of the Philippines and the disposition of the Philippine military bases are purely American affairs, but it is also willing to consider in good faith proposals to guarantee the neutrality and independence of the Philippines.

<h3>The United States All Expresses Approval of US-Japan Understanding</h3>
<p>Solemn Treaties Have Been Broken</p>
<p>Giving Opportunities to Resolve Disputes</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. government and Congress continued to give good criticism to the exchange of letters between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. According to Democratic Representative Pope, "Japan has broken the solemn treaties it has concluded with us, but if Japan can resolve disputes with us through negotiation, I am willing to give it an opportunity to rehabilitate itself, because we really want peace." Representative Berkman also said, if Japan really wants to resolve disputes with us, then the United States may as well accommodate it. Representative Connolly spoke from the standpoint of cotton production and sales, saying that since Japan is the largest customer of American cotton, the United States does not need to provoke it. Japan and the United States mutually trade cotton and raw silk, which are mutually satisfactory, and hope that the two countries can reach a compromise. American people all express their approval of the exchange of letters between Hirota and Secretary of State Hull. The Washington Evening Star, a moderate American newspaper, published news of the negotiations between Japan and the United States in a prominent position, and there is also a long commentary, which said that Japan and the United States are ready to join hands, regardless of each other's past suspicions and fears. The Washington Daily said that the exchange of letters between the US and Japan is creating a new era of Pacific friendship. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Horiuchi Talks About American Feelings Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Actual Problems Are Still in the Back</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Consul General in New York, Horiuchi Kensuke, was appointed Director of the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the American Bureau. He returned to Japan from the United States this morning on the Chichibu Maru. According to the conversation, the US President and Secretary of State meet with reporters several times a week, but have never mentioned the Far East issue, so the American people have not received major stimuli. The United States is currently busy revitalizing the national industry and does not seem to value the Far East issue or the naval issue. When Foreign Minister Hirota took office, the American court and the opposition paid attention to what Hirota's diplomatic policy would be. However, the foreign minister's diplomatic speech outside the parliament, the appointment of Ambassador Saito to the United States, and the smooth progress of the fisheries negotiations on the Sino-Eastern Railway issue, etc., can make Americans understand that Japan has no intention of invading other countries (?). Therefore, although rumors of an emergency in the Far East spread from Moscow for a time, American feelings towards Japan have improved and they do not consider it a major problem. As for political issues such as the recognition of "Manchukuo", they have not yet appeared on the surface. (23rd Jiji Telegram)</p>
<p>Yokohama Horiuchi Kensuke, who was promoted from Consul General in New York to Director of the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chief of the American Section, arrived in Yokohama at 7:30 this morning on the postal ship Chichibu Maru. The person spoke to reporters visiting him on the ship as follows. The relationship between Japan and the United States has recently taken a turn for the better, one reason being that Roosevelt is focusing on domestic issues, and the result of deeply understanding Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomacy. At present, President Roosevelt is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Far East issue, and there is less political criticism in the press on the issue of the "Manchukuo" implementing an imperial system. Also, there are more powerful opinions that discussions on naval issues are premature, and that various negotiations between Japan and the United States on practical issues are still in the back.

<p>(Tokyo) Diplomatic sources said that the Japanese government is paying special attention to the movements of Britain and the United States regarding the issue of international recognition of the puppet organization, especially the activities against the United States. That is, Ambassador Saito was ordered to inquire about the true opinions of the United States. If the United States intends to recognize it, the Japanese side will make a secret agreement with the United States on the following three principles: (1) Japan is willing to reiterate that "Manchukuo" abides by the principles of open door and equal opportunity; (2) Japan is willing to recognize the superior position of the United States in its activities in North China; (3) Japan is willing to protect American investment in North China and "Manchukuo" in cooperation with the United States.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on the Meaning of Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>Not Permitting True Independence</p>
<p>(Moscow) The United States House of Representatives has passed the Philippine Independence Act.  *Pravda* comments on it, saying that the Philippine Islands occupy an extremely important military position. The main purpose of this proposal is nothing more than to ensure the neutrality of the Philippines through special international treaties. There is no doubt that this treaty will hinder Japan from seizing the Philippines.  Furthermore, the United States does not allow the Philippines to have true independence. The proposal also reserves its right to maintain naval bases in the Philippines, while at the same time prohibiting Philippine sugar from being imported into the United States (this is what American sugar producers have resolutely demanded). This is the essence of the proposal, it is said. (TASS dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Attitude Towards Japan</h3>
<p>Chamberlain Still Yearns for the Old Alliance</p>

<p>(London) The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, said in a speech in Newcastle today that various British businesses are now showing signs of recovery, more so than any other country.  He also said that he did not believe that there were any irresolvable disputes between Britain and Japan, and that the two empires were bound together by mutual respect, many years of friendship, and the old alliance. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the two issues of Japanese goods dumping and the breakdown of Anglo-Japanese cotton industry negotiations, two ministers expressed their opinions today. The Minister of Commerce, Runciman, declared in the House of Commons regarding the impact of this issue on unemployment, saying that abandoning the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty would be a great mistake. Runciman said, "Improving our commercial relations with Japan is indeed necessary, but we should not act rashly, lest the harm outweigh the benefits."  Conversely, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, said in a speech in Newcastle, "The situation of Japanese goods dumping is indeed worrying. If Britain does not take appropriate protective measures, the position of the Lancashire cotton industry will become increasingly serious. We really cannot make concessions beyond a certain limit. This is very obvious. However, I do not abandon hope, because I do not believe that there are any serious differences of opinion between the two great powers of Britain and Japan that cannot be avoided," and so on.

Foreign Minister Hirota, having determined the truth of the Soviet Russian proposal, replied that he would answer after consulting with "Manchukuo."  Then, they discussed the fishing zone issue. The Foreign Minister insisted that the auction bidding and the assessment rate issues should be completely separated, and that the conditions for raising prices could not be negotiated, politely rejecting the Soviet proposal.

<p>(Harbin) Regarding the frequent incidents of Soviet Russian military aircraft and cavalry violating the territory of "Manchukuo," the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Soviet Russian Consul General in Harbin, Slavutsky, issued a serious warning protest to Moscow. Consul General Slavutsky has already received important instructions from his government and made a special visit to the diplomatic commissioner, Shi Luben, for some important proposal. Shi said that he had not yet received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and could not clearly state the content of the proposal, but it cannot be denied that the Soviet Russian protest has considerable importance, so he is currently in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will soon begin formal important negotiations with Soviet Russia.

<h3>Japanese Diet Questions Brazil's Anti-Japanese Issue</h3>
<p>Minister Nagai Replies:</p>
<p>It is the Government's Responsibility to Encourage Foreign Immigration and Trade</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:17 PM on the 23rd, during which Nakamura Yoshiki of the Government Friends Association raised a question:</p>
<p>Recently, the anti-Japanese sentiment in Brazil has become quite strong. There are currently about 170,000 Japanese in Brazil, and it is a suitable place for Japanese development in the future. How should the government try to promptly abolish the Brazilian anti-Japanese immigration bill?  What is the government's future belief regarding this point?  Please give a clear answer.</p>
<p>Minister Nagai replied:</p>
<p>Japanese immigrants are the most outstanding members of agricultural immigrants in the world and possess a spirit of peace. Especially for immigrants to South America, besides coexisting and prospering with the Brazilian people, they have no other intentions. Anyone close to Japanese immigrants can understand this. Even elementary school education is completely the same as that of Brazilian nationals. Other things can be imagined. Some people who do not understand the actual situation are now rising up to oppose Japan. We will cooperate with the foreign affairs authorities to explain the misunderstanding. Although it is very difficult to solve the population problem, I believe that both foreign immigration and foreign trade should be encouraged in an integrated manner, so as to make them understand that Japanese immigration is where we are striving, and so on.

<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, the former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army and concurrently Director of Special Affairs, and currently the commander of the 6th Division, arrived in Tokyo at 5:45 PM today. Army leaders such as Minister of the Army Hayashi, Vice Chief of Staff Ueda, Generals Kawai and Minami, and Major General Nagata welcomed him at the station. General Koiso immediately entered the palace to report on the military situation in Manchuria. (Hualian dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Koiso spoke to reporters in the car as follows: "Since the implementation of the imperial system in 'Manchukuo,' the Manchu people's attitude of affinity towards Japan has become increasingly close. The Manchurian issue is very important from now on. As for the South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan, there is concern that the distribution of benefits will be reduced, or that the power of the army is too strong, etc. On this point, we are giving full consideration." (Dentsu dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) From the perspective of prioritizing public order, the various units of the Kwantung Army, cooperating with the Manchukuo Army, are adopting a so-called dispersed deployment system. Because the intended purpose has been largely achieved, from this year onwards, they will return to their original national defense stance, devoting full effort to training the troops. The Hirose and Kebi teams will take on new important tasks, and the Wakayama and Kamabori teams will also begin withdrawing the dispersed troops within days. Although the garrison locations after the withdrawal will not be much different from the present, they will be concentrated in important cities and locations along the railway lines. However, except in cases where it is unavoidable to eliminate local bandits, the Manchukuo Army will be solely responsible. (Dentsu dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Tender "Taigei" Completed</h3>

This ship is a naval construction outside the limits of the London Naval Treaty, namely one of the first supplementary plans. It was originally scheduled to be completed next year, but in view of the increasingly urgent world situation for Japan, work was accelerated and completed ahead of schedule. The launch date is undecided. It is planned that Captain Kumazo Fubihara will be appointed as the captain. (Hualian dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Navy of Siam</h3>
<p>Only Eight Warships Applicable</p>
<p>Khamtai. The Siamese naval magazine recently published an article entitled "Our Navy," which describes the past and present of the Siamese Navy in detail, saying that the purpose of the Siamese Navy is not like that of the great powers who want to seize maritime hegemony, but only to defend themselves. Because the coastline of Siam is 1,500 miles long, if something happens one day, and the ports are blocked, panic will be seen in less than seven days. Therefore, Siam needs a proper navy for self-defense, which is obvious and urgent. However, although Siam has continued to try to improve after the naval defeat in 1873, its strength is still thin, and the construction of the ships has been a long time. Generally, each ship is only sufficient for 20 years, submarines for 15 years, and destroyers for only 5 to 10 years. An investigation in January of this year revealed that only eight warships are applicable. (Hualian dispatch, 23rd)</p>

The disaster situation at Yachongqiao will be investigated and then the provincial government will allocate funds for relief. In fact, all the small passes near Gubeikou have been recovered. The puppet troops in Caojialu will be withdrawn soon, but they are requesting 500 yuan for repair costs. Because the amount is limited, it is not a problem. Receiving Malanyu will begin within days. Long-distance telephone lines have been installed in the counties of the Jiji district and will be able to make calls soon.

On the 23rd, the miners in the Tangshan mine still worked underground under the leadership of the Belgian engineer. The mine police protected the wells to prevent accidents. On the 23rd, the workers of the Majiagou and Zhaogezhuang mines stated that they had not sent representatives to participate in the strike activities of the Tangshan mine workers. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 23rd, the striking workers in Tangshan organized a workers' united team, divided into three brigades, each with three companies. The workers wore red cloth strips with the brigade number written on them, and carried wooden sticks and iron rods, patrolling the streets with the inspectors. Seeing the tense situation, the merchants closed their doors completely again. The workers submitted twelve articles to the Public Security Bureau, requesting a response. The Public Security Bureau remained closed and guarded. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the striking workers demanded that the contractors provide food and drinks, requiring them to be prepared within five hours. The contractors did not comply, and the workers gathered to surround the contractors' residences, intending to use force. The mine police rushed to the scene and dispersed them.

The letter stated that the mining company signed a draft agreement with the previous strike representatives, which did not include promises to pay 40 days of Zhenjing expenses and blood and sweat labor funds, nor did it promise to increase wages for the workers. This time, a small number of workers were instigated to strike, and the government has taken measures to stop it. The reason for the workers' strike was a conflict with the representatives and had nothing to do with the mining company. However, the mining company is suffering losses for a long time, which is really not good. It is determined to make every effort to quell the strike. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Observations on the US-Japan Understanding (Ang Ruo)</h3>
<p>The resolution of international issues involves no more than three paths: diplomatic negotiations, armed intervention, and war. The Washington Conference succeeded and the Shandong issue was resolved. This is one example of an international issue resolved through diplomatic negotiations. The intervention of Russia, France, and Germany in the return of Liaoning is also a clear demonstration of armed mediation. As for war, it is the last resort after diplomatic failure and the failure of intervention. Given the warnings of the dangers of war and the fear of unpredictable outcomes, unless one harbors a狂妄 psychological desire for military aggression or is forced into a dangerous situation where the foundation of the nation is shaken, one is unwilling to easily make a desperate gamble. Since the Balkan issue led to an unprecedented world war, the world has been exhausting itself in the arduous task of reconstruction. Since war is not possible and peace cannot be achieved, the Far Eastern issue has fallen into a stalemate.</p>
<p>Recently, the exchange of documents between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has been published, shocking the world. This is indeed a major turning point in US-Japan relations and a major key to the future of the Far Eastern issue. It has the same profound meaning as the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia. To what extent the US-Japan understanding has reached and to what situation it will evolve in the future, outsiders have no way of judging. However, our diplomatic authorities should be vigilant and prepare for how to deal with it, which seems self-evident.</p>
<p>Various parties have already made various speculations about this US-Japan understanding. In fact, in our observation, this is just the beginning of a negotiation to bring the extremely thorny Far Eastern issue, which is gradually falling into the crisis of a second world war, into diplomatic negotiations. The issue itself still needs to be negotiated in the future. Changes are unpredictable. As for whether it can be resolved and how it will be resolved, it is still difficult to say. Even President Roosevelt and Foreign Minister Hirota may not have this confidence.</p>
<p>The issues raised in the telegram regarding the initial US-Japan understanding include the US revising its immigration laws, abandoning naval bases in the Philippines, and recognizing the puppet state. Japan will exchange this for maintaining the current 5:5:3 naval ratio. The path of negotiation requires waiting for Japanese Ambassador to the US Saito to return to Tokyo for consultations, and then holding a naval conference next year. At the same time, a second Pacific Conference will be held. The countries participating in the conference, in addition to the US, UK, China, Japan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal, which signed the Nine-Power Treaty, will also include Soviet Russia, which has a close relationship with the Far Eastern issue. It is still remembered that when the League of Nations failed to handle the Northeast issue, some people advocated convening a conference of the Nine-Power Treaty countries. The Far Eastern situation has been deadlocked until now. Either a general resolution will be made through war, or the only other way is a second Washington Conference to make a compromise diplomatic resolution.</p>
<p>For now, we will leave aside the immigration issue, the Philippine issue, and the naval ratio issue, which are only of secondary importance to us. Let's try to speculate on the so-called issue of recognizing the puppet state. The US's Far Eastern policy is based on two major foundations: the Open Door Policy and the Nine-Power Treaty. The starting point of these two major basic policies is directed at Japan. The Paris Peace Conference failed to make Japan return Shandong to us. American public opinion was greatly shocked. Wilson's policy failed because of this. Our country refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles. The US Senate also did not approve it. The degree of deterioration in US-Japan relations at that time was similar to today. When the Pacific Conference established the Nine-Power Treaty, the first article stipulated that "Respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China." It also said, "Shall not take advantage of the situation in China to seek special rights, reduce the rights of the people of friendly countries, and shall not encourage actions harmful to the safety of friendly countries." Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that "The contracting countries agree not to conclude treaties or agreements, or understandings, alone or jointly with any one or more countries, that would infringe or hinder the principles mentioned in Article 1." The puppet state was created by Japan alone to cover up its aggression. This has become a settled case in the international community. In our country's internal affairs, Puyi's usurpation constitutes an act of rebellion. Although international relations are extremely unpredictable, and President Roosevelt has repeatedly announced to us with extraordinary actions, it is beyond our logical imagination to say that he will overturn all Stimson Doctrine, League of Nations resolutions, and even the Nine-Power Treaty, without obtaining the consent of friendly countries and regardless of the serious consequences, and directly recognize the puppet state as a means of promoting his own recovery.</p>
<p>A Washington dispatch says, "Observers believe that all countries related to the Far East should participate in the US-Japan discussions. It also said that the US expressed in its reply that the resolution of the Pacific issue must be bound by existing treaties, because this is a multilateral issue and not simply a bilateral issue between the US and Japan. There are many speculations here about the act of recognizing 'Manchukuo'. It is believed that the US may not take this action without the participation of China and Soviet Russia." This is indeed a talk close to the truth. From this, it can be seen that the US still has no intention of tearing up existing treaties. Japan's actions, however, violate existing treaties everywhere. Therefore, to try to resolve the Far Eastern issue with the spirit and text of international treaties without contradicting them, how far away is the time to seek a resolution with related countries?</p>
<p>According to a London telegram, the UK welcomes the US-Japan understanding. It also claims that the US will first advise our country to be the one who unties the bell, and the promotion of the ambassadors of various countries stationed in China to ambassadors will be used as an exchange. Then the crux of the problem still lies in our country's taking good care of itself.</p>

<h3>Solving Economic Difficulties Lies in Focusing on Far East Trade</h3>
<p>Borah's Extraneous Remarks Involve the Silver Issue</p>
<p>Grain Monopoly Considered an Urgent Task</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Senator Borah delivered a speech at the Foreign Policy Conference, criticizing the government's reduction of grain production, saying that millions of Americans are currently suffering from hunger. If Americans want to remedy today's unstable phenomenon, they must urgently manage grain production. Under the goal of revitalizing the United States, grain monopoly is an urgent task. If the United States wants to solve its financial problems, it must be good at coping with foreign trade. The United States' assumed markets in the future are in the East and Soviet Russia. There is a major clause that must be considered in the current trend, that is, the method of making money by using foreign trade is the common practice of these countries in the past two years. Borah's speech has attracted the attention of the financial community, because the unspoken meaning involves the silver issue. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the silver bill began to proceed in the House again. It was found that four days after the House passed Darcey's bill, the supporters of the silver bill transferred the proposals of Goldwater and Bullock and the amendments of Schickele from the subcommittee to the House Banking and Currency Committee, and obtained a favorable report. It is said that some people have asked the Banking and Currency Committee to immediately study the bill and amendments so that they can be submitted to the parliament as soon as possible. Goldwater's proposal is the more important bill in this session of Congress's silver bill. This bill proposes the establishment of a monetary committee, whose members are the Minister of Finance, the President of the Federal Reserve, and three people appointed by the President. If the price of goods is higher or lower than the standard price in one year, the monetary committee may increase or decrease the gold content of the US dollar to limit it. Schickele's amendment is to suggest to the Ministry of Finance to purchase at least 50,000,000 ounces of silver per month until the purchase of silver reaches 1,000,000,000 ounces, or the gold-silver ratio reaches a ratio of sixteen to one. The silver certificates issued by the government will be determined by the amount of silver purchased by the government. (National Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Studies Continuing Disarmament Negotiations</h3>
<p>Choose One of Three Methods</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the cabinet members held a meeting, based on the report submitted by Eden's tour of Europe and the recent communication from France, to study the disarmament issue. In order to continue the disarmament negotiations, the cabinet should choose one of the following three methods: (1) The meeting of the minority committee of the Disarmament Conference's Presidium will still be held on April 10th, and the British representative will be instructed to propose convening the General Committee. Germany has already recognized the British disarmament plan as the basis for discussion, so if the General Committee meets, the German representative is expected to participate. (2) Secondly, only convene a smaller meeting of countries that are particularly concerned, so that the disarmament issue can be more easily resolved. (3) Thirdly, only bilateral negotiations will continue to be conducted between the two countries. Which of the above three will be chosen must be determined after the Cabinet Disarmament Committee meeting on Monday makes an explanation. However, the general opinion at present is most in favor of the first method (Havas on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Disagreement on Monetary Policy: Swiss Finance Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Political Situation Becomes Eventful From Now On</p>
<p>Swiss Capital Semi-official sources say that Finance Minister Moser has resigned due to disagreement on monetary policy. The Swiss Federal Council has decided to maintain the price of the Swiss Franc. (Reuters telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Bern Today's news: Swiss Finance Minister Moser resigned yesterday because the Swiss Federal Council refused to accept his plan to reform finance and economy. It is believed that the political situation in Switzerland in the future may not be far away. According to Moser, if one wants to maintain the gold standard of the Swiss franc at the moment, the financial and economic reforms he personally suggested are indeed a key plan. However, the Federal Council ignored this point and refused the Finance Minister's reform plan. Therefore, the Finance Minister resigned. It is said that Switzerland has never had a political situation of this nature before, so the leaders of the Swiss government are deeply concerned that Moser's plan will fail, which is enough to cause unease in Switzerland in the future.

<h3>Germany Trains Party Army</h3>
<p>Formulates Three Types of Badges</p>
<p>(Berlin) Non-governmental Cabinet Minister and Chief of Staff of the National Socialist Party Army Roehm has recently formulated three types of physical education badges for the Party Army, which are awarded in grades according to the level of training of the Party Army. These badges are practically equivalent to the army's military ranks. The first type is made of copper and can be awarded to any German people "who meet the qualifications for joining the army." The so-called qualifications are that they have been examined by a doctor, interviewed by the Party Army captain, and tested in the field. The second type is made of silver and is awarded to anyone who passes the instructor's examination. The third type is made of gold and is dedicated to the captains of each stormtrooper team. The physical training of the Party Army includes racing, throwing, hand grenades, shooting targets with small-caliber firearms, and walking in the field with military uniforms. Those who have been awarded badges by the Party Army have the obligation to be summoned whenever the leader calls. (Havas on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Internal Conflicts in Belgium Dissipated</h3>

<h3>Arab Kingdoms in Conflict</h3>
<p>Hejaz and Yemen</p>
<p>(London) The story that King Ibn Saud of the Arab Hejaz is now at war with the Imamate of Yemen, after being released by Reuters, has been confirmed by the Arab Embassy. According to reports, Yemen is a part of Arabia and also a Muslim country, and has never cooperated with Hejaz. Negotiations have been underway recently, but after seven months, they have come to nothing. Now there is a split. Ibn Saud has instructed Prince Aziz to lead troops to expel the Yemeni troops stationed in the Dhehar Mountains. Neither side is a member of the League of Nations. Hejaz is a completely independent country, and the United Kingdom signed a treaty recognizing it in 1927. Yemen is located in the southern part of Arabia and is also an independent country, but is somewhat protected by the United Kingdom. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Tragic State of the Hakodate Fire</h3>
<p>More Than 90,000 People Homeless</p>
<p>Authorities Begin Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>Actual Number of Dead and Injured (Tokyo) Regarding the Hakodate fire, the Ministry of Home Affairs made the following public announcement at 9:00 PM on the 22nd:</p>
<p>The fire started at 6:30 PM on the 21st and was extinguished at 7:00 AM the following morning. The cause of the fire is unknown. 23,600 houses were burned down. 652 people died. 450 people were injured. Hundreds of people who fled to the seashore were swept away by storm waves. 92,000 people are homeless.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report of the great fire, the police department immediately dispatched 180 police officers. The 7th Division also sent troops to help maintain order, and public safety was gradually restored. The origin of the fire was the Fukuda-ya Fireworks Manufacturer in Yachigashira-cho. Important buildings that were burned down include the Hakodate Police Station, the Hakodate City Hall, the 12th Bank, the Chamber of Commerce, the Civic Hall, the Hakodate District Court, and the Hakodate Tax Office. There are three causes for the great fire: (1) At the time of the fire, there was a gale with a speed of about 18 meters per second due to the influence of a low-pressure system moving from the Sea of Japan to the central part of Hokkaido; (2) Most of the Hakodate topography is sloping; (3) The roads were too narrow. (23rd Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire Although there is a theory that the cause of the great fire was a chimney being blown down, according to one report, the municipal authorities and citizens were in a dispute over the reduction of electricity fees, which had escalated to the point of a breakdown in talks. Many residents participated in an electricity boycott alliance and used kerosene lamps, leading to carelessness. (23rd Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>Scene Photographs Hakodate After the great fire, a special correspondent from Dentsu, who entered the scene at great risk, telegraphed the tragic situation in the city, saying, "The city is completely leveled. In the ruins, mothers are looking for their children and wives are looking for their husbands, their faces washed with tears. Their misery cannot be described in words. Only iron-framed buildings and fireproof warehouses still stand proudly. At night, the whole city is dark, and only the swords of the garrison soldiers shine. The bodies of those who were burned to death are being collected in parks and elementary schools. Crows and magpies are already flocking to the corpses along the coast, fighting to eat them. The disaster victims are destitute, some wearing only underclothes. Added to that, it is snowing, and there is concern about freezing and starvation." (23rd Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<p>No Way to Escape (Tokyo) According to a special correspondent from the Rengo News Agency who telegraphed from Hakodate, the Hakodate fire was just like the great Tokyo earthquake of previous years. Because of the fierceness of the fire, whirlwinds occurred everywhere, and pillars of fire soared into the sky. Groups of refugees ran under the pillars of fire, resembling a living hell. Residents in the western part of the city were able to evacuate more easily due to the advantageous terrain, and there were fewer deaths and injuries. However, the residents in the eastern part of the city first evacuated to the open space on the coast, but then a sudden change in wind direction occurred. The refugees had the raging sea behind them and the raging fire coming at them from the front. There was nowhere to escape, resulting in total destruction. More than 100,000 citizens were homeless, standing alone on the streets. By daybreak, the wind and snow were mixed, and people were continually suffering from frostbite, a very tragic scene. (23rd Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>Relief Efforts Hakodate Hakodate Mayor Sakamoto convened an emergency city council on the charred earth on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss ways to help the disaster victims. Relief efforts began immediately. The Railway Bureau made arrangements to give preferential treatment to disaster victims traveling by train. Because many of the shipping company's crew members lived in Hakodate and their whereabouts were unknown, they were working hard to recruit crew members. Although there were as many as 100,000 disaster victims, the order in the city was not disturbed, making it relatively easy for the authorities to maintain public safety. (23rd Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>Hakodate The anxiety of the victims has gradually decreased since contact was established with the mainland and relief supplies were transported in. White smoke still lingers in the embers. Everywhere, people are searching for bodies and treating the injured. In the meantime, lumber and other materials have been transported from various places. Thatched huts are being built in the city as temporary shelter. Reconstruction has also begun. (23rd Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to exempt refugees in Hakodate from taxes for one year, that is, to completely exempt income tax and business income tax in the disaster area. The bill will be submitted to both houses within days. The government also recognizes that the great fire has provided a great lesson in national defense and has decided to thoroughly study future fire prevention measures. (23rd Dispatch from Hualian)</p>
<p>Fire Insurance Claims (Tokyo) The Fire Insurance Association will hold a meeting at 2:00 PM today to discuss the payment of Hakodate fire insurance claims. Insurance Department Director Ishii from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will attend the meeting. As a result of the negotiations, it was decided to begin paying out claims immediately. The total amount of claims paid out due to the Hakodate fire by Japanese and foreign insurance companies is approximately 15 million Japanese yen. (23rd Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>

<h3>Yang Xiaocang Talks About His Impressions of Traveling in Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Xiaocang, the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, resigned from his position due to illness and came to Nanjing. According to him: (1) Since the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations had disputes, the overseas Chinese in Japan felt all kinds of oppression and it was difficult to describe. The recent situation has been eased compared to before. (2) It is rumored that both China and Japan will temporarily shelve the Northeast issue and discuss the outstanding Sino-Japanese cases first. Because I left Japan almost a month ago, the recent situation is not very clear. I am serving as a military attache and have rarely asked about diplomacy. But according to my personal observations, it is still too early to talk about resolving outstanding cases. (3) After the so-called "Manchurian Government" was organized in the three eastern provinces and declared itself emperor on March 1, the Japanese were ecstatic, and it was painful to say. (4) I have been subjected to all kinds of stimuli in Japan. Last year, I suffered from gastrointestinal disease for half a year. I have repeatedly requested to resign, and now it has been approved. I have telegraphed Chairman Jiang in Ganzhou, and will go to Ganzhou to report to him and report the past history of serving as a military attache in the museum after receiving his reply. It has not been decided whether or not to visit Wang, who also serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, because I am in charge of military affairs.

<h3>Zhu Jiqing Goes to Hebian to Meet Yan</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhu Jiqing came to Bing from Ping last night. This morning, he went to Hebian to visit Yan, and returned to the province that evening. He attended a banquet hosted by Zhao Daiwen, Jia Jingde, Zhu Shouguang, and others. According to Zhu, the purpose of this visit was to discuss with Yan the resettlement of over 5,000 Northeastern anti-Japanese volunteer soldiers who had retreated to Pingjin without clothing or food to the Northwest for land reclamation. This has been decided by the Fourth Plenary Session and allocated 50,000 yuan for implementation. Due to funding constraints, it is planned to move 1,000 young people first, with the rest to follow. The Ministry of Interior and Ministry of National Defense have already sent personnel to Suiyuan to investigate. After meeting Yan, I will also go to Suiyuan, he said.

<h3>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Negotiate the Luan River Area Problem in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tao Shangming, Chayama, Yiga, and Others Meet</p>
<p>Discussed for a Long Time at the Beining Railway Dormitory</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: At 11:00 AM on the 20th, Chinese and Japanese representatives held an important meeting at the Beining Railway Bureau dormitory on Haihe Road in the Tianjin Special District. The Chinese side was represented by Tao Shangming, Administrative Inspector of the Luan-Yu District; Zhu Shiqin, Counselor of the Beiping Military Branch; and Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau. The Japanese side was represented by Chayama, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Ping; Yiga, Chief of the Yuguan Special Service Organ; and Ohashi, Staff Officer of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin. Chayama came to Tianjin from Ping on the 19th night, and Yiga rushed from Yuguan on the morning of the 20th. The focus of this meeting was that Japanese troops are stationed everywhere in the Luan River area, and Japanese and Korean residents are relocating to the interior of the pass in large numbers. The Chinese side feels that it cannot freely exercise local public security administration. If the Chinese and Japanese sides act independently, it is inevitable that misunderstandings will arise over time. Also, from the Shi River to Yuguan, the Japanese side has designated it as a garrison area for the Japanese army stationed in Shanhaiguan, and armed police and wartime security teams are not allowed to pass through. However, local ruffians in Shimentai, Taitouying, Jianchangying, and Saheqiao collude with external forces and commit many evils. The county magistrate lacks the strength to control them, so wartime security teams must be sent to patrol to deter them. Furthermore, Japanese troops are stationed at various stations along the Beining Railway from Tanggu to Shanhaiguan. Whenever vehicles enter the station, Japanese troops are deployed on the platform to perform their inspection and surveillance duties, which clearly conflicts with the authority of the Chinese police. Due to the unclear demarcation of boundaries at Shanhaiguan Station, there is often confusion in parking vehicles and managing trains. In addition, the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants in the Luan River area and the rectification of public security were also the focus of this meeting. Previously, when Tao Shangming went to Ping, he had reached an agreement with Chayama to take advantage of Yiga's visit to Tianjin to meet with Umezu Mijiro to discuss matters with each other. Yin Tong also believed that a meeting was necessary. Therefore, on the morning of the 20th, they held talks for a long time at the Beining dormitory, and generally reached some results. Tao Shangming was unwilling to disclose the content of the meeting because the results had not yet been implemented, so it is difficult to know the actual extent of the discussions. (20th)</p>
<h3>Yan Huijing Visits Chiang to Report on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Chiang Finishes Meeting with Provincial Education Directors, Etc.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Yan Huijing, Ambassador to Russia, arrived in the province from Nanjing on the 20th and stayed at the Shanghai Commercial Bank in Guangrunmen. On the same day, he went to visit Chairman Chiang for a brief meeting before leaving. Today, Chiang invited Yan to a casual meal at his residence. It is reported that Yan reported on the general situation in Europe, the situation of the League of Nations, the attitude of various countries towards the puppet organization, the conflicts between Japan and Russia in the Northeast, and the meetings with Wang Jingwei, Ye Chucang and other members of the Central Committee in Nanjing and Shanghai after returning to China. He elaborated in particular on his impressions gained in Russia. At the same time, he consulted Chairman Chiang on his diplomatic policy and requested instructions on everything. Chiang also expressed his views. It is reported that Yan will stay in the province for another day or two and will meet with Chiang again. After discussing specific diplomatic methods, he will leave Jiangxi for Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, the provincial government secretaries-general, civil affairs and education directors, and administrative inspectors of Sichuan, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, who came to Jiangxi to attend the administrative conference, have separately visited Chairman Chiang after the closing of the conference. With the exception of a few civil affairs directors and administrative inspectors who departed for various recovered bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi to inspect construction work, the rest have departed from the province one after another. Chen Bulei, Lü Bisho, Lu Dai of Zhejiang, Zhou Fohai, Cheng Tianfang of Jiangsu, etc., took the early train on the Nanxun Railway today (21st) to Xunyang, and then transferred to a boat to Nanjing.

<h3>Another Strike Wave Breaks Out at the Kailuan Coal Mines</h3>
<p>Clash Between Workers and Police, Three Workers Shot Dead</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Government Orders Strict Suppression</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Kailuan Coal Mines include six mining areas such as Tangshan, Majiagou, Linxi, and Guye, with tens of thousands of workers. The coal produced annually supplies factories in North China and is worth tens of millions of yuan, making it one of the largest foreign-owned enterprises in China. The mining areas are all located in various counties in the Luan River area. The composition of the workers is complex. After the war zone was recovered last year, traitors and communists have been trying to agitate the workers in an attempt to disrupt the local area. In March of this year, there were two labor strikes, which were fortunately resolved by the authorities without incident. Unexpectedly, the Tangshan mining area had unstable news the other day (18th). The Tangshan Public Security Bureau received the news that there were about five or six thousand workers in the Tangshan mining area and feared that it would cause another incident. That afternoon, it summoned workers' representatives Zhang and Ma for questioning and intended to persuade them. The workers mistakenly thought that Zhang and Ma were arrested, so they gathered hundreds of people and surrounded the Public Security Bureau. The bureau then released the workers who had been summoned. In the evening, the workers went on strike. The next morning (19th), many workers guarded the mine entrances, preventing other workers from going to work. At that time, there were still more than 200 workers and four foreigners underground. They threw bricks and stones from above, intending to cause danger. At the same time, other workers used flammable materials to burn the wood piled up in the mine. Seeing the serious situation, the Public Security Bureau sent police to suppress them. The workers refused to obey and a conflict broke out. The workers attacked with wooden sticks, and the security team had no choice but to open fire as a warning. As a result, three workers, Hu Zhenhai and Yang, etc., were killed, and Du Shun, Wu Yusheng, Hu Baochao, Zhao Wanshun, etc., were seriously injured. Stray bullets injured one peddler and one foreign overseer, all of whom were sent to the Chinese hospital for treatment. On the police side, three people including Wang Huanrong were seriously injured. Martial law has now been declared within the Tangshan mining area, and the situation is still serious today. The provincial government received a telegram from Zhao Xun, Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, and Li Yinchun, the inspector stationed at the factory, yesterday morning reporting the incident. It urgently telegraphed the Tangshan Public Security Bureau: (1) Strictly suppress unstable workers to prevent the situation from escalating; (2) Declare to foreigners that it is absolutely responsible for protecting the property of the mining area. The Department of Industry also simultaneously urged Administrative Inspector Tao Shangming to return to Tangshan to coordinate with the inspector stationed at the factory for a quick settlement. It is reported that the workers' demands include three items: (1) Increase wages; (2) Pay 40 days of fright money; (3) Pay workers' labor money. The above three items are not only outside the previous labor-management agreement, but also the names such as fright money are unheard of. Therefore, all parties believe that there may be another background. (March 20th)</p>
<h3>Part of Liu's Bandits Flee into Yucheng, Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Ma Brigade Opens Wen Shang to Increase Defense</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang has now fled from Henan to the Caoxian and Dingtao areas of Shandong Province. Governor Han Fuju of Shandong Province has transferred the 59th Brigade of Zhao Xinde stationed in Jinan, part of the 22nd Division of Gu Liangmin, the 81st Division's Brigade of Yun Qichang, and the cavalry regiment of Li Xuande stationed in Guantao in northern Shandong to the Yancaojining area in southwestern Shandong to deploy defenses. Yesterday morning, the cavalry regiment had a brief contact with the bandits in the Weiwanji area southwest of Caoxian and drove the bandits back in a panic. Today (20th), it was reported that a part of them fled to the Yucheng county area. In order to strictly prevent them from being completely eliminated, Han specially transferred a part of Ma Guan's 222nd Brigade of the 74th Division stationed in Dezhou to Nankai to strengthen the troops. Ma was receiving training in Jinan and returned to Dezhou last night. He led his troops on three trains and passed Jinan at 6:00 AM today (20th) and planned to disembark at Dawenkou and open Wen Shang for preparation. At the same time, he ordered Dai Hongbin, commander of the armored vehicle, to lead the first armored vehicle team to Yanzhou this afternoon. In order to facilitate command, Han also plans to go to Yanzhou to command the encirclement and suppression of Liu's bandits. (20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi-Hubei Railway to Start Construction Before June</h3>
<p>Railway Department Survey Team Departs for Survey</p>
<p>Scheduled to Be Completed in Three Years</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang believes that the transportation between Jiangxi and Hubei needs to be connected urgently. He previously telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to plan the construction of the Jiangxi-Hubei Railway and telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to survey as soon as possible. It is reported that after receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Railways, it immediately made active plans. It has now safely estimated the entire route and engineering materials and has appointed a large survey team. It is required to start construction before June of this year and complete the entire road within three years. (March 22nd)</p>
<h3>Survey of Profits and Losses of Various Industries in Yuci, Shanxi Province Last Year</h3>
<p>More Than 250 Companies Closed Down</p>
<p>Economic Decline, the Market Is Very Depressed</p>
<p>Yuci Correspondence: Since the Spring Festival, news of business closures has been heard every day. The reporter went to the Chamber of Commerce to investigate. Recently, a total of 164 companies have closed down in urban areas and 94 in rural areas, so the market is very depressed. The profit and loss situation of the existing companies last year and the circumstances of the companies that closed down are listed below.</p>
<p>Textile and Electrical Industry (1) Jinhua Textile Factory is the largest factory in Yuci, with a capital of 4 million yuan. Its business losses for the year ending in September totaled more than 370,000 yuan. From October to the end of the year, yarn sales gradually improved, and more than 40,000 packages of cotton were purchased at low prices. Therefore, it made a profit of 100,000 yuan in three months. It was decided at the board meeting on the 7th of this month to still issue half of the official interest of 4%. The shareholders' meeting will be held on April 29th. (2) Weiyu Electric Power Plant is also one of the large-scale enterprises in Yuci, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. Due to high expenses, its surplus last year was 10,000 yuan, and no official interest was paid. The bonus was only about 5%. In addition, too many companies closed down this year, the number of users has decreased sharply, and business is not prosperous. The shareholders' meeting has now entrusted the directors and managers to discuss maintenance methods.</p>
<p>Banking Industry There are 24 money shops and banks here. Thirteen have reported closures, including Jinxilong, Jinshenheng, Yongquantai, Guangyilong, Jinchuan, Jinfengji, Yongxingtai, Deyifeng, Jusheng, Dale Yu, Guangquanqing, Jiyichang, and Yuansheng, with a total capital of more than 400,000 yuan. Others that need to be cleared due to losses are not included. Currently, there are only 11 left, including Jinxin, Zhengxinyu, Yijude, Yuyuanyong, and Wanliheng. Except for Jinxin Zhuang, which made a profit of more than 8,000 yuan, Zhengxinyu, which made more than 6,000 yuan, Yixiangde, which made more than 5,000 yuan, and Yuyuanyong, which made more than 4,000 yuan, the rest can only maintain expenses. The reasons for the losses in the banking industry are approximately twofold: (1) greed for high-interest loans in rural areas; (2) the market's financial resources are exhausted, and turnover is not flexible, which has a great impact.</p>
<p>Color Silk Industry Due to the large inventory and falling selling prices in the color silk industry, 9 out of 20 companies have closed down, including Yongtaiwei, Siyixing, Dejuheng, Yifengtai, Qianyuanji, Ganshengyu, Jilüxin, Yihenghe, and Jinshengji. Moreover, the majority are famous companies with large capital that have been around for a long time. The total capital of each company is about more than 300,000 yuan, with more than 100,000 yuan in debt. The shareholders are at a loss. Only 11 remain, including Yuanjisheng and Ruiningxia. Except for Ruiningxia, which still makes a profit of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan at its external store in Liangzhou, etc., it is rare to find companies that can support themselves.</p>
<p>Calico Industry This industry has declined due to the sharp drop in freight rates, weak purchasing power in rural areas, and the impact of donations and taxes. The business tax owed by each household is as much as 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Therefore, out of a total of 17 companies, 12 have closed down, including Lijin Company, Jinshengyong, Ruishengxiang, Jifeng Hou, Liquanmao, Yonghe, Juqingyong, Rongdeyi, Yonghe, Guangyilong, Baohe Hou, and Jifengcheng. Except for Jifenghou and Jifengcheng, the capital of the others is also more than 150,000 yuan. Jintong Flower Store made a profit of about 23,000 yuan due to its strong capital. Xiechengyu also has a slight surplus. In addition to those that can offset expenses, it is already a blessing.</p>
<p>Paint Industry The impact on this industry is roughly the same as that of the calico industry. Out of 41 companies of all sizes, 11 have closed down, including Jinfenghou, Tianshunxing, Cuizhenchang, Wanqingwei, Yongyuhe, Yongshengmao, Yongxingquan, Yongshenghao, Yiyinquan, Jinjuhe, and Maoshenghou. The total capital of the closed-down companies is also about 200,000 yuan. Although there are 30 large and small companies remaining, such as Juxingshun and Gongxingshun, losses are common.</p>
<p>Grain Industry This industry has collapsed because of the sharp drop in grain prices, heavy donations and taxes, and the speculative nature of those engaged in it. Therefore, 12 out of 15 companies have closed down, including Defengli, Jujinchuan, Fushengheng, Heji, Deshengheng, Guangshunyi, Dejuxiang, Qingheheng, Deyusheng, Qingyufeng, Tianyi, and Jinfengzheng. The total capital is also more than 200,000 yuan. Only three companies, including Jitai Gong, remain, and the losses are also significant.</p>
<p>Wine and Noodle Industry The wine industry has been affected by the weak purchasing power of the public and the increase in liquor taxes, while the noodle industry has been affected by the sharp drop in wheat prices and the decrease in business. Therefore, 11 out of 25 companies have closed down, including Deshengyong and Tongquanyong. The capital is also more than 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Only 14 remain, including Weiyu Flour Mill and Deshunquan. The capital of the flour mill is 140,000 yuan. There is no official interest, and it can only make a profit of more than 12,500 yuan. Most of the smaller capital companies have suffered losses.</p>
<p>Transportation Industry Due to the reduction in freight and the heavy burden, the losses are greater than in other industries. Of the 8 companies in total, 2 have closed down, including Huifengchang and Henglitong. The capital of each is more than 10,000 yuan. The remaining six companies are Yiheyong, Wanfeng, Jitalong, Yishengtong, and Yishenghe. Except for Yiheyong, which still makes a profit by transporting cotton, the others have more losses than profits.</p>
<p>Tobacco Industry Currently, because more people are competing to smoke Jinhua paper cigarettes from this province, and British and American cigarettes are also packaged and sold by Jinhua, Tongji Tobacco Shop, which opened in August and September of last year, closed down this year along with Yonghe Company, Hengyuanhao, Sanyi Tobacco Shop, and Tongji Tobacco Shop. The remaining dry tobacco industry has also been closed because of the small number of sales, and Taichang has also closed with a total of 81. Five of the 12 industries, such as the clothing and cloth industry, tobacco industry, transportation industry, pawnbroking industry, and grain industry, are likely to be unable to establish trade associations due to the lack of the legal number of members.

<h3>Recent News on the Training Conference of the First Administrative Region of Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>The current chairman of the Mass Training Committee of the First Administrative Region of Jiangxi Province is Li Jiading. Since its organization and establishment on February 1, it has spared no effort in carrying out mass training work. For example, the cadre training class for the communist eradication volunteer team, the guard teams for bunkers, roads, bridges, and transportation lines in various counties and districts, patrol teams, detective teams, relay posts, and Baojia training have all been organized and completed one after another. Zhang Liangfu, vice chairman of the committee, personally led a large number of trainers and instructors to various districts to conduct strict training. It is expected that results can be achieved in the shortest time. As for other aspects of mass education and relief, such as the establishment of mass fire brigades, mass health associations, health inspection brigades, propaganda teams, mass clinics, vaccination clinics, mass libraries, reading rooms, national martial arts halls, mass schools in urban and rural areas, and the New Life Movement Promotion Association, the committee has vigorously promoted them, donated funds, and gradually organized and established them.</p>

<h3>Factory Worker Suspected of Stealing Socks Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>A Hu surname sock factory in the Sidun area of the Fourth District of the county was stolen 260 gross of thread socks the day before yesterday. The socks were originally kept by workers Wang Yinxiang, etc. The factory owner Hu Erguan suspected that Yinxiang was heavily involved. Yinxiang asked himself that he had not committed this act, and was unwilling to be wronged, but suffered from not being able to prove it. So he suddenly had the idea of suicide. Last night, he hanged himself in his bedroom. After the factory owner discovered it, he was extremely shocked and immediately reported it to the county government through the district office. It was decided that the investigating judge would be dispatched today (22nd) with the examiner to conduct an autopsy and a thorough investigation of the factory owner and others.</p>

<h3>Dismantling a Deserted Grave Results in a Crushing Death</h3>
<p>Wang A’gen, a farmer living in Shangqi Tu outside the South Gate, hired workers to dismantle an abandoned grave in the field because it occupied a large area of land. However, the grave was unusually strong and took a long time to excavate. On the morning of the 21st, one end of the grave was finally demolished. A’gen then climbed into the hole to carry out work. Because the surrounding ash and sand were loosened during the demolition, the stone slab covering the top fell down, crushing A’gen to death. When the other workers lifted the stone slab, his flesh was blurred and looked like a meat pie, a tragic sight. Yang A’sheng, who entered with A’gen, was also seriously injured and was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are very serious and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>The Liu Zhuomin Case's Scope Expands</h3>
<p>After former Public Security Second Sub-bureau Chief Liu Zhuomin was ordered to be dismissed, because his wife, Li Rongzhen (also known as Wen Rongzhen), had a sworn sister relationship with Li Shuyun, the concubine of Gu Renfa, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, he hid guns and official seals and refused to hand them over, leading to his being placed under the supervision of the County Public Security Bureau and sent to the court. Liu was temporarily released on a written bail of four hundred yuan, while Li was detained pending investigation. Furthermore, Chen Guofu, the Chairman of Jiangsu Province, investigated and found that Director Gu's concubine, Li Shuyun, and her mother had been engaging in activities such as flaunting their influence to extort money and selling official positions. He reported this to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who dispatched personnel to arrest Li Shuyun and her mother on Ma Lang Road in Shanghai and hand them over to the Second Special District Court. At the same time, he ordered Magistrate Yan of this county to send a letter to the county court, dispatching bailiffs Yang Shuzi and Feng Yongbao to Shanghai with the letter to escort Li Shuyun and her mother back to the county for interrogation. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the inside story of this case is extremely complex and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. A few days ago, Magistrate Yan received another order from the province, stating that when Liu Zhuomin was in office, he had privately settled cases involving the use of "red pills" (likely referring to opium or similar substances), committed fraud, and engaged in corrupt practices. He was ordered to immediately arrest Liu and hand him over to the law. After receiving the order, Magistrate Yan immediately secretly sent a letter to the Procuratorate of the county court, which dispatched bailiff Huang Yong to Liu's residence in the Donghu Hotel at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd) to arrest him and take him to the court, where he was temporarily detained pending trial. At the same time, he telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau, ordering the Inspector General Zhang Yu, Inspector Liu Renyi, and the newly appointed Second Sub-bureau Chief Gao Lian to go to the court for questioning. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Chief Qian opened an investigation court for interrogation. As a result, it was ordered that Liu Zhuomin be taken into custody, and the others were ordered to return. As for Li Shuyun and her mother, they were originally scheduled to be escorted from Shanghai around 12:00 noon yesterday (the 23rd) and arrive in Wuxi around 4:00 PM. However, as of 5:38 PM, when the northbound special express train arrived at the station, Li Shuyun had not been seen being escorted to Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Fire Under the Embankment Claims the Life of an Elderly Woman</h3>
<p>At Yanxia, near Jiangxi Bridge Town in the Second District, a rural woman named Hua, aged fifty-six, met with misfortune. Last night, the Hua family was careless, and neighbors heard the alarm and sounded gongs to call for help. Fire brigades from nearby rushed to the scene to put out the fire, but it was too late. All two rooms and three sections of the house were reduced to ashes. Hua was unable to escape and perished in the flames, a truly tragic event. The neighboring Chenhua Elementary School building was also affected, but the damage was slight.</p>

<h3>Scheduled Start of Construction on the Zhencheng Road</h3>
<p>The Fourteenth District Office of Wu County convened a labor mobilization meeting on the 22nd to construct the Zhencheng Road. The following important matters were resolved: (1) It was resolved that the road line within the district is mostly difficult to construct due to high peaks, and the Zhencheng Road Engineering Office should be requested to demarcate areas for soil and ash extraction outside the boundary line. (2) It was resolved that during the construction period, the county magistrate should be ordered to order all automobile companies to stop operating to facilitate the project. (3) It was resolved that construction would start simultaneously on the 29th of this month. (4) It was resolved that Shao Qin and others would be appointed as section chiefs for each township to be specifically responsible. (5) It was resolved that Su Zhichao would be appointed as the chief supervisor.</p>

<h3>Request to Exempt Hong Oil from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Tong Oil shops in Zhenjiang argue that the two types of Hongjiang oil and Xiu oil are made from Tong oil raw materials and are sold exclusively domestically. There is no foreign trade. When shipped out of Hongjiang and passing through Hankou, the local Commodity Inspection Bureau also requires them to pay the same inspection fees as Tong oil. The Business Tax Bureau even requires them to pay the same export business tax as Tong oil, which seems to violate the purpose of the state establishing bureaus to collect taxes. Although the oil shops have branches in Hankou, they are solely responsible for handling the transshipment of goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Small barrels of Hong oil are also among the transshipped goods and there is no business activity involved. Forcing them to pay taxes is no different from levying internal transit duties. They have jointly submitted a request to the Hubei Finance Department, asking it to order the Hankou Business Tax Bureau to exempt the two items of Hong oil and Xiu oil that are transshipped from export business tax to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants.</p>

<h3>Charity Association Provides Relief to the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>The Poverty Relief Clinic of the Charity Association outside the East Gate of this county has been established for three years and has achieved good results. The Chinese and Western doctors hired are able to conduct thorough research in the area of diagnosis without the slightest negligence. Therefore, dozens of people come to the clinic every day. It is said that those who are extremely poor are not charged any fees. Even those who are not extremely poor are only charged ten copper coins for registration. Western medicine is provided by the association, and Chinese medicine is also provided to the poor and sick by the association. If a sick person from another province or a distant place wants to stay in the association for treatment, they only need to obtain a formal letter of guarantee or a letter from an organization or group, and it is acceptable. Recently, the association also started providing free smallpox vaccinations from the 16th for the general poor and sick. The establishment of the Poverty Relief Clinic of the Charity Association is truly a blessing for the poor and sick. However, it is heard that the association is facing financial difficulties and plans to raise funds. It is thought that there is no shortage of charitable people in this county who will provide generous assistance.</p>

<h3>Silk Shop Manager Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>The Hongxing Silk Shop in Yuanmen Bridge, Yangzhou, went bankrupt last year, owing as much as fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Although lawyer Guo Zhen was engaged to liquidate the assets, many of the creditors were widows and orphans relying on their savings to survive, and most of them did not follow the legal procedures. They gathered and approached Pan Xihou, the shop owner and manager, personally to demand payment. Pan, unable to cope, suddenly disappeared a few days ago. His family searched everywhere, but to no avail. Yesterday, the Dada Company sent someone to report that he had taken the Longda ferry to Shanghai from Huojia Bridge on the 18th and jumped into the river to commit suicide about ten miles from Tongzhou. Upon hearing the news, his family was distraught. His son-in-law, Wang Ziren, traveled day and night to Tongzhou to search for the body in the surrounding river area.</p>

<h3>Western Hunter Shoots and Injures Farmer</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to traffic in Zhapu, transportation has become more convenient. Westerners living in Shanghai often drive to Zhapu for sightseeing. On the 18th, a Westerner drove his private car to the Longwangtang Houbang area and carried out a hunt with a gun and live ammunition. Unexpectedly, a farmer named A Da, who was working in the field, was hit by the Westerner's bullet in a vital area and fell to the ground unconscious. Later, a villager spotted him and rushed to inform the injured person's family. He was immediately taken to Zhapu Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury is very serious and there may be a threat to his life. However, the Westerner who caused the accident was not detained at the time of the incident and it is difficult to investigate.</p>

<h3>Chinese International Society Pays Attention to Changes in the US Attitude</h3>
<p>Board Meeting at 6 PM Tomorrow</p>
<p>A Serious Declaration Will Be Issued in Addition to Research</p>
<p>Shanghai News: Since the US and Japan exchanged the so-called friendship documents, the situation in the Pacific has changed greatly, arousing heated attention internationally. It is of particularly important concern to our country. The Chinese International Society, an organization of experts who study international issues, is paying close attention to this serious situation. They believe that there should be a major expression of our national opinion towards the United States. It has been decided to convene a board meeting at the Shanghai Lianhuan Club at 6 PM on the 25th of this month (Sunday) to focus on the issue of the sudden change in the US attitude. In addition to discussing the direction our country should take and offering suggestions for the authorities to adopt, according to Xu Xingchu, the standing director of the society, a declaration may be passed to express our national opinion to the United States and to awaken our compatriots to pay attention to the matter.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Discuss Unifying National Finances</h3>
<p>National Finance Conference to be Held in Mid-June</p>
<p>Kong and Song Will Go to Nanjing on the 25th to Attend the Economic Conference</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing at 7:25 AM yesterday. He went straight to his private residence on West Yanan Road to rest. He then met with reporters from various newspapers around 10 AM. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to work. Kong is scheduled to go to Nanjing with Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, on the 25th to attend the plenary meeting of the Economic Council. The following is a record of Kong's remarks:</p>
<p>National Finance Conference to be Held in June According to Kong, the Ministry of Finance is scheduled to convene a National Finance Conference in Nanjing in mid-June, inviting finance officials from various provinces to discuss issues such as unifying national finances, abolishing excessive taxes and levies, and reorganizing national land taxes. The Ministry of Finance has decided that in the future, county budgets will be approved by the provincial government, and any shortfall will be subsidized by the provincial government. Provincial budgets will be approved by the central government, and any shortfall will be subsidized by the central government. Only in this way can the goal of unifying national finances and abolishing excessive taxes and levies be achieved. As for the rumors that the National Finance Conference will be held in mid-May, they are not accurate.</p>
<p>Chiang Will Not Attend the Plenary Meeting of the Economic Council Kong continued to say that the National Economic Council is scheduled to convene a plenary meeting in Nanjing on the 26th of this month. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is busy with military operations against the bandits and cannot leave Jiangxi. He will probably not be able to return to Nanjing to attend. Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling) is currently staying in Shanghai. The report that she came to Shanghai from Nanjing last night (the 22nd) to treat a dental problem is not accurate.</p>
<h3>People Along Baoshan Dike Urge Allocation of Funds for Dike Repair</h3>
<p>Delay Will Have Unforeseen Consequences</p>
<p>Yan Fenglou and others, dike directors along the Baoshan Dike, telegraphed: Nanjing National Economic Council, In recent years, the Jiangnan seawall has not been repaired for a long time, and dangerous situations are emerging one after another. The Baoshan section is particularly important. It suffered two typhoons last year, destroying more than 2,800 zhang. Although the provincial government allocated 60,000 yuan for temporary repairs, there are still many holes and a crisis is looming. If it is not fundamentally repaired, it will not be able to withstand an autumn flood. Last winter, your council sent a foreign engineer to inspect and assess the dike, but several months have passed and construction has not yet started. The people along the coast are extremely anxious. Now that the spring flood season has arrived, we feel even more uneasy. If it is delayed any longer, it will become irreversible. The severity of the disaster may be even greater than the floods in Hankou and Gaoyou in the past or the Yellow River breach last year. Fenglou and others have witnessed the dangerous situation and cannot sit idly by. We urgently appeal to your council to consider that the Jiangnan seawall is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Give priority to the urgent matter and quickly allocate large sums of money for construction to eliminate the major disaster. The telegram is extremely urgent. Yan Fenglou, the dike director of Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, and all the people bow. Sealed.</p>
<h3>Wu Yun-chu Establishes Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Products Factory</h3>
<p>Factory Site Selected, Machinery Purchased</p>
<p>Manufacturing Can Begin Next Spring</p>
<p>Division of Labor and Cooperation with the Ministry of Industry's Ammonium Sulfate Plant</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Recently, many newspapers carried an Associated Press dispatch from Seattle stating that the machinery of the Pacific Ammonia Chemical Plant there has been sold by the Hengxin Gunpowder Company to an unknown buyer and will be moved to Shanghai within two weeks. The factory was originally a fertilizer manufacturer, but with slight modifications, it can manufacture gunpowder products. Yesterday, Western newspapers also reported that a local industrialist had ordered machinery from France to use the products of the above machinery to manufacture nitric acid, and that the two are part of the same organization. However, the Associated Press did not know the name of the buyer, and the Hengxin Company refused to elaborate on the sale. The ownership of the nitric acid plant was also not detailed. After the reporter inquired in many ways, it was learned that the two plants belong to the same company, and the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory is the center. The reporter then visited Wu Yun-chu, the manager of the factory, and the following is what he said:</p>
<p>Operating Motivation According to Wu, most small industries are based on light profits and heavy operations, while basic industries are the opposite. In recent years, the Tianchu Factory has been able to stand on its own, so it is engaged in chemical industries that others believe are not easy to run or are unwilling to run, but which must be run from a national standpoint. It is shouldering this important task and making efforts to move forward. Five years ago, it started the green gas industry and established the Tianyuan Electro Chemical Factory. Now the foundation of the factory is solid, and the second step is to establish an anhydrous ammonia industry factory. The anhydrous ammonia industry actually controls the nation's life and death, because grains, fruits, and vegetables rely on anhydrous ammonia fertilizer to grow, and without nitric acid (one of the most important anhydrous ammonia products), there would be no way to supply national defense needs.</p>
<p>Products Next Spring This factory is named the Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Products Factory, with a capital of one million yuan, which has already been raised. The machinery has been ordered from the United States and France. These are the two factories mentioned in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days. The machinery ordered from the United States has been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai in about a month to be installed, which will take about five months. At that time, the machinery ordered from France can also be shipped and installed continuously. Therefore, the entire completion will take about seven or eight months, and manufacturing must begin in early spring next year. The factory site has been selected near the Tianyuan Factory in Chenjiadu, west of Shanghai. Because after the January 28th Incident, the city of Zhabei was extremely dilapidated, and the local water and electricity plants were greatly affected. After the Tianli Factory starts operations in the future, it will use more than 50,000 degrees of electricity, which will help the sale of electricity.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Steps The manufacturing of the factory is divided into two steps. The machinery ordered from the United States is to catalyze anhydrous ammonia from the anhydrous ammonia in the air and the hydrogen in the water. The machinery purchased from France is to catalyze nitric acid from anhydrous ammonia and oxygen. It is estimated that the machinery can produce 11 tons of nitric acid per day. However, if it needs to be increased, it can be produced up to twice that amount. The above two products are important raw materials in the industry. However, the factory focuses on the production of nitric acid because it can be used to manufacture fertilizer for enriching the soil. Although the factory and the Ministry of Industry's ammonium sulfate factory are both in the same business of fixed anhydrous ammonia from the air, the factory focuses on producing ammonium sulfate, while this factory focuses on producing nitric acid and nitrates, so they divide the labor and cooperate.</p>
<h3>National Products Tycoon Wu Zhihao Hosts a Banquet for Various Circles</h3>
<p>Exposes Japanese Conspiracies in the United States</p>
<p>Awakens Compatriots to Use National Products</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, a local national products tycoon, held a spring banquet at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association at 6 PM the day before yesterday to assist the Zhibo (Chicago Exposition) Product Cooperation Association and to organize the North China and Northwest China National Products Exhibition. He invited people from all walks of life who were enthusiastic about national products. Those who attended included Qin Runqing, Zhou Guanhong, Xu Shiying, Zha Mianzhong, Hu Chengxiang, Shen Jiucheng, Xu Xinliu, Wu Zhihe, Wang Xiaolai, the County Magistrate Hu of Fenghua, Wu Zhijian, Wang Yansong, Zhou Fainan, Wu Wenjing, Pei Yunqing, Li Zushen, Zhang Zilian, Yuan Duanfu, Xu Tingzuo, Wang Qiyu, Wen Lanting, Lou Shaobai, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Shenzhi, Shen Tianxin, He Dekui, Zhuo Yuting, Zhang Xianglin, Xiang Weichen, Xue Dubi, Xue Chunsheng, Xu Caicheng, Sun Meitang, Xu Yongzuo, Cheng Shouchu, Dong Boying, Chen Jicheng, and more than 100 other people. Wu Zhihao reported that since the September 18th Incident, Japan, in order to confuse international public opinion, planned to take advantage of the opportunity for various countries to participate in the Chicago Exposition in the United States to conduct organized and complete propaganda that would damage our country and intended to realize its consistent claim to seize all markets in our country. It spared no expense to lure Chinese traitors to transport a large number of enemy goods and vigorously dump them. This can be known from the monthly customs reports on Japanese goods imports. However, the Japanese are still not satisfied. After encroaching on our four northeastern provinces, they threatened North China and planned to seize Tianjin again and advance into the Northwest and Henan-Shandong provinces. Zhihao and his colleagues, in view of the impending national crisis, felt that if we do not catch up quickly, death will not be far away. Therefore, last year, after the government decided to stop participating in the Zhibo because of the loss of Rehe, the emergency in Tianjin, and the shortage of transportation funds, he appealed to the financial community, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, and the industrial community, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and other gentlemen, to raise funds and present them to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, which subsidized 50,000 yuan of national currency to organize the Product Cooperation Association to participate as scheduled. According to the report of the association, the Japanese did hire an American beauty in the Zhibo meeting place to give a lecture, publicly insulting our national integrity and deliberately making various counter-propaganda. They placed our old and worst products in the same place as their newest goods and drove the public to watch. Later, the Chinese Pavilion used various methods to strongly negotiate with the Zhibo, and the conference officially sent a letter to prohibit it. Finally, the Japanese side was angry and sold off the beauty and threatened the Zhang representative of the pavilion with a gun. From this one incident, we can know the ambition of the Japanese. Therefore, the value of this trip is not only to expose the Japanese conspiracy and obtain the good sympathy and praise of the Europeans and Americans, but also to enhance the international position and create a foundation for foreign trade. The Zhibo has decided to continue the exhibition for another year. The colleagues will continue to assist the association in taking a step further. For the fundamental plan to promote national production, they have obtained the government's strong assistance and have been unanimously initiated and supported by all walks of life in the country to organize the China National Product Production and Sales Joint Company in Shanghai, with the hope of establishing branches across the country and creating a large group of production, sales, talent, and economy. In addition to handling the work that should be done, the company is also concerned that the Japanese are eyeing North China and that enemy goods are filling the Northwest. In the late winter and early spring of last year, it successively sent letters to the Tianjin and Gansu provincial governments and authorities from all walks of life to agree to organize a large-scale national products exhibition to awaken the people to use national products to build an economic network and serve as a barrier for the northeastern and northwestern provinces. However, the above three matters are of great importance and cannot be fully accomplished without collective efforts. Therefore, today, Zhihao has prepared a simple meal and respectfully invites all of you to attend. I sincerely hope that you will uphold the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country and strive to assist together. Zhihao is not talented, but he should follow the骥尾 (refers to following a great person, here meaning to be inspired) and provide inspiration. The words were profound, and the entire audience was moved. Zhou Guanhong, Shen Jiucheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Li Zushen, Zhang Zilian, and others then gave speeches. At the end, there was a fun drama by the female staff of the Shanghai National Products Company, Ren Chaojun's flower boxing, the Song of Hate by the singer of the Xifan Film Company, and the scenes of the Zhibo's entire day and night, to entertain the audience. It was not until 11 o'clock that the banquet ended happily.</p>
<h3>He Bingxian to Accompany Chen Gongbo to Nanyang</h3>
<p>Chen to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that my country's foreign trade has gradually declined in recent years, and that the national products transported to Nanyang and other places are gradually decreasing, plans to accompany Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo on a visit to the Nanyang Islands next month to study the reasons for the decline in order to take measures to salvage the situation. Chen is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing this morning to handle departure procedures. Therefore, He has decided to present the situation to Chen in person after Chen arrives in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Celebrate Duan's Birthday Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guests Welcomed at the Jade Buddha Temple</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 70th birthday of Duan Qirui. His old friends wanted to celebrate Duan's birthday, but Duan did not want to overdo it because the country was in a difficult time. Therefore, he welcomed guests at the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road. Everything was kept simple. From 9:00 AM, important people from all walks of life went to offer their congratulations. Duan's nephew, Gongzi Honggang, gave thanks. Duan retreated to the rest room next to the auditorium to chat with the guests. He was in good spirits. He did not return to his residence until about 1:00 PM. The four walls of the auditorium were covered with congratulatory banners from all sides. Chairman Lin and President Wang, as well as the authorities of various provinces, all had congratulatory messages. In addition to presenting a birthday character personally written by Chiang Kai-shek, with the inscription "To the respected Mr. Zhilao for his 70th birthday" and "Respectfully wished by his student Chiang Kai-shek", Chairman Chiang also sent Zhang Xiqian, the Director of the National Government Ceremonial Bureau, as his representative to Shanghai to offer birthday greetings. In addition, more than 100 people, including Zhang Binglin, Xu Shiying, Wu Guangxin, Xue Dubi, Wang Yitang, Zhang Shizhao, Li Sihao, Xi Xinzhan, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Du Yuesheng, went to offer their congratulations. Wu Peifu, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Feng Yuxiang, and Chen Diaoyuan also sent representatives. The carriages and horses filled the door, making it a grand occasion for a time. According to Duan's aides, Duan has no intention of going to Hangzhou for the time being. The rumor that he will go to Hangzhou at the end of the month to participate in the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly is not true.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sign Sea-Air Intermodal Transport Contract</h3>
<p>Nine Articles of the Contract Officially Signed</p>
<p>The Issue of Ticket Refunds Still Needs to be Considered</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Railways and the shipping companies signed a land-sea intermodal transport contract, the national intermodal transport will soon be completed. Now, the Ministry of Transportation is further expanding intermodal transport with various foreign airlines. At the same time, sea-air intermodal transport is also being implemented by the local China National Aviation Corporation and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which are negotiating a sea-air intermodal transport contract. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nine Articles of the Contract China National Aviation Corporation and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently noted that the number of passengers transferring from ships to airplanes is increasing, and the number of passengers transferring from airlines to ships to reach ports not yet reached by air is also increasing from time to time. In order to facilitate passengers, it has been decided to implement sea-air intermodal transport. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can issue joint tickets for passengers who want to transfer to airplanes, and vice versa, airlines can also sell China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship joint tickets for passengers who want to transfer to the merchant ships. The two parties have convened multiple negotiations on the joint transport contract. After repeated deliberation and revision by both the airline and the shipping company, nine articles of the sea-air intermodal transport contract have been officially signed.</p>
<p>Immediate Implementation Regarding sea-air intermodal transport, each will use its existing routes as the scope. China National Aviation Corporation's current aircraft have the Shanghai-Chengdu line (which can be connected with ships along the Yangtze River), the Shanghai-Peiping line (which can be connected with ships in the Bohai Sea), and the Shanghai-Guangdong line (which can be connected with ships in the South China Sea). All places that can be reached by the ships and airplanes of the two airline and shipping companies are places where intermodal transport tickets can be mutually sold. The procedures are very simple and convenient for passengers. Currently, only the issue of ticket refunds still needs to be considered. After the two parties have prepared the formal contract and exchanged it, intermodal transport can be implemented.</p>
<h3>The Sultan of Johor Departed Shanghai for Japan This Morning</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Held a Farewell Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Since his arrival in Shanghai, Sir Ibrahim, the Sultan of Johor, has been quite busy attending banquets hosted by various Chinese and foreign circles. British Consul-General, Mr. P. Brennan, specially hosted a luncheon for him at the Consulate-General on Huangpu Road at 12:30 yesterday noon. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng also hosted a banquet at his private residence, Wang Lu on Haig Road at 7:30 last night, with the company of Mr. Yu Ming, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, British Consul Mr. P. Brennan, and leaders from various Chinese and foreign circles. It is learned that the Sultan and his wife, along with a party of six, were scheduled to board the Japanese ship "Taiyo Maru" last night around 10:00 PM and are expected to depart from Shanghai this morning to visit Japan.</p>
<h3>Construction of Docks and Opening of Shipping Routes in Sanmen Bay</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Proceed in Two Steps</p>
<p>The development of Sanmen Bay is actively underway with overseas Chinese investing capital. It has been decided that an inspection group will be organized on April 1st. The construction of docks and opening of shipping routes by the China Merchants Bureau has also been agreed upon and will be carried out in two phases. Recent news is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Investment: Recently, many overseas Chinese from various regions have invested in claiming nearby open land in Sanmen Bay. The price of land is very low, but due to the large number of purchasers, it has gradually increased. As of now, the land claimed by overseas Chinese in Sanmen Bay has reached more than 3,000 acres. Most of the land claimed is in the Jianba area. The large landowners, such as Liang Sheng, have now organized the Jianba Area Land Claim Committee.</p>
<p>Scheduled Inspection: For the purpose of assisting in the development of Sanmen Bay, the Jianba Area landowners have organized the Overseas Chinese Sanmen Bay Inspection Group. They have now gathered overseas Chinese to form a group and are scheduled to go to Sanmen Bay on April 1st to conduct on-site inspections and study the opening of the port and the development of various industries in the area. Investors hope that the authorities will expedite the two major issues of port construction and navigation, so that the Sanmen Bay market will flourish, land prices will increase, and the goal of establishment will be gradually achieved.</p>
<p>Request for Port Construction: The Jianba Area Land Claim Committee has recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, stating that Banba and Jiangdong Port in Sanmen Bay are natural seaports and transportation hubs, and essential areas for reaching various parts of Zhejiang. Construction in Sanmen Bay should begin with the construction of docks in these two locations. They specifically request the Ministry of Communications, from a national standpoint, to order the China Merchants Bureau to quickly build wharves in Jiangdong Port and Banba as the foundation for opening Sanmen Bay, and to open shipping routes in the short term, so that cargo transportation in eastern Zhejiang can be shipped from there.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Solicitation: Based on the submission from the Jianba Area Committee, which invested in land purchases, the Ministry of Communications immediately instructed the state-owned China Merchants Bureau to solicit opinions regarding the construction of Banba and Jiangdong Port wharves in Sanmen Bay, as well as the addition of shipping routes from Sanmen Bay to various locations. They were ordered to submit their opinions immediately. After receiving the order, the China Merchants Bureau submitted the matter to the Business and Shipping Departments. The result of the discussion was that the construction of Banba and Jiangdong Port wharves and the opening of shipping routes must be carried out in two steps. The first step is to build Jiangdong Port wharves and warehouses when Sanmen Bay has a port model and a commercial market begins. When cargo transportation is secure, new shipping routes will be opened. The report was submitted to the Ministry of Communications for review yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wu Tianmin Discusses the Recent Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>All Industries are Monopolized by the Japanese</p>
<p>The People of the Northeast are Complaining Endlessly</p>
<p>Every Day They Hope for the Central Government to Recover the Lost Territory</p>
<p>Actively Laying Railroads to Facilitate Military Affairs</p>
<p>New News Agency reports that since the "September 18th Incident," the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen. Although there are still some patriotic people continuing to fight the enemy on the border, it is regrettable that the general public seems to have ignored the suffering after the event. Recently, Mr. Wu Tianmin, who returned from the pseudo-state, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and joined the refugee self-help group led by Jiang Minsheng, the "Leather Shoe General," to support himself. According to him, the recent situation in the pseudo-state is quite detailed. The following are the details of his statement:</p>
<p>Implementation of Immigration Policy: Since Pu Yi was used by the Japanese to usurp the throne on March 9, 1932, the Japanese have used this as a deceptive means externally. On the one hand, they implemented an immigration policy, with Koreans accounting for 70% to 80%, and Japanese accounting for only a small number. The areas with the most immigrants are Yilan, Harbin, and Zhaozhou along the Songhua River, followed by the vicinity of Tao Si Zha. Before the September 18th Incident, Japanese already occupied a considerable position in various important cities in the three eastern provinces, regardless of industry or commerce. Therefore, the monopoly of industry and commerce after the recent immigration is self-evident.</p>
<p>Recovering Lost Territory in the Northeast: After the Japanese occupied the area, they used deceptive means to try to lure the people, but their ferocious face was finally revealed. The people felt that they were being manipulated by the Japanese everywhere, making it difficult to make a living. Usually, when minor disputes occurred with the Japanese, they were bound to suffer. Therefore, the people there are complaining endlessly and hope that the central government will recover the lost territory in the Northeast as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Confiscating Firearms from the Public: Most of the people there have self-defense firearms, because of the frequent bandits. Recently, the Japanese secretly feared that the people would take the opportunity to revolt. In areas close to cities, they have confiscated firearms from house to house. Those far from the city have requested the Japanese military to postpone the confiscation in order to defend against bandits. The Japanese feared that being too strict might cause misfortune, so they have temporarily agreed. It is expected that the confiscation will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Korean Army Supervising the Puppet Army: The troops compiled by the puppet state, nominally called brigades, are actually less than two regiments. The organization of each regiment has only two people serving as advisors or counselors in the regimental headquarters (the divisions and brigades increase proportionally). Although their titles seem empty, the highest-ranking officers must be commanded by the advisors or counselors when dealing with any affairs. Therefore, the entire puppet army is controlled by the Japanese and cannot exercise freedom. Recently, the Japanese, fearing that the puppet army stationed in northern Hebei would rebel, have increased the deployment of the Korean army to supervise them, to prevent accidents. This shows a glimpse of the psychology of the puppet army.</p>
<p>Actively Laying Railroads: Since the Japanese occupied the four northeastern provinces, they have been actively laying railroads to facilitate military transportation, as buying out the Chinese Eastern Railway has been difficult. The completed ones include the Jiha Railway (from Jilin to Harbin, about 500 li long), the Jihui Railway (from Dunhua to Tianbaoshan, already connected), the Jitong Railway (from Jilin to Tongjiang, about 1,200 li long), and the Angchang Railway (from Angangxi to Changchun, about 800 li long). The remaining ones that are not yet completed but are planned include the Taoan to Lubei Railway, which is about 1,800 li long.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Manufacturers in Panic Over Trademark Argument That Only Considers Shape, Not Sound</h3>
<p>Believe the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation is Far From Reality</p>
<p>Trademark Disputes Will Become More Frequent</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that regarding the provision in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law, which stipulates that the words, graphics, symbols, or combinations used in a trademark must be particularly distinctive, the interpretation by the Judicial Yuan that the words in the Trademark Law only refer to the shape they express and do not include pronunciation has caused panic among manufacturers in Shanghai. They believe that this will make it easier for others to counterfeit their brands. The following is a record of the process of this interpretation and the opinions of manufacturers:</p>
<p>Two Different Opinions: Previously, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had two different interpretations regarding whether the term "literature" in the provision included pronunciation. Opinion A stated that ordinary philology is divided into three categories: shape, sound, and meaning. Should pronunciation, which is sound, be included? Opinion B stated that trademarks are a type of mark. Referring to the conditions of similarity or approximation listed in Article 2 of this law, such as national seals, military flags, official seals, medals, party flags, party emblems, portraits, names, awards, commendations, and business names, all of which are concrete marks and have nothing to do with sound, pronunciation should not be included. Both opinions had their reasons. Also, if pronunciation is included, China has a vast territory and complex dialects, but the sale of goods should be nationwide. If problems of similar pronunciation occur without standards, there will be numerous disputes. Which pronunciation should be used as the basis?</p>
<p>Original Interpretation: Later, the Ministry submitted the matter to the Executive Yuan for interpretation by the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan then issued a reply. The original text of the Judicial Yuan's reply was obtained from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and is transcribed as follows: (Omitted above) This case has been resolved by the Uniform Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Court. Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law only states that the words used in a trademark must be particularly distinctive and specifies the color to be used. This shows that the words in the Trademark Law only refer to the shape they express and do not include pronunciation. The meaning is further clarified by the examples in Article 2 of the same law, all of which indicate shape and have nothing to do with pronunciation. A corresponding reply is hereby made.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Opinions: After reading the above interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, manufacturers in Shanghai were greatly alarmed. According to a powerful manufacturer who spoke to a reporter from the Far East News Agency yesterday, this interpretation by the Judicial Yuan is too far from the reality of manufacturers. Old brands that have been sold for many years will inevitably be counterfeited by unscrupulous merchants. Because national education in our country has not been popularized, there are not many literate people. If the shape of the words is the only consideration for word trademarks, and the pronunciation of the words is not considered, it is tantamount to only looking with the eyes and not listening with the ears. For example, if the products of Factory A use "山羊" (mountain goat) as a trademark, and Factory B sees that the "山羊" products of Factory A are selling very well, they will use "三陽" (three suns) as a trademark and sell similar goods, mixing them in the market. How can illiterate customers distinguish them? It is feared that cases of trademark disputes and lawsuits will be even more frequent in the future.</p>

<p>Investigation Report: The association also released the 3rd election report, stating: "In addition to publishing notices in the newspapers and soliciting taxpayers to come to the association to fill out the forms, as usual, the association also pre-filled the names of taxpayers based on the previous register and then sent staff to conduct investigations in various ways. If there were no changes, the old information was retained, and the taxpayer only needed to stamp the investigation form for verification. If there were changes, a new form was filled out. As of December 25th of last year, a total of 5,436 investigation forms were received. Before the register was prepared, excluding duplicate and unqualified forms, a total of 5,270 investigation forms were actually received. After the investigation was completed, the election register was prepared, distinguishing those with and without voting rights. On March 13th, a public notice was published in the newspaper according to the election regulations. If there were any errors or omissions, taxpayers were asked to come to the association before March 20th to correct or add them. The deadline was considered final. A total of eight people came to the association during the period to declare additions. A total of 5,278 investigation forms were received before and after. Therefore, the draft number of the election register was 5,278 elector names. After the names of electors were entered into the register and draft numbers were assigned, there were still three people who were unqualified due to insufficient tax amount and one person who had passed away. There are still 5,274 people left, including 2,734 people with the right to be elected and 2,540 people with the right to vote. Therefore, the official number is 5,274, and the number of election tickets issued is 5,274, which adds up to the above number. Please refer to the investigation statistics table."</p>

<h3>Collection of Joint Transportation Parcel Fees Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>To be Implemented from April 1st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, based on the Joint Transportation Office's proposed five articles for the collection of joint transportation parcel fees upon arrival, has decided to implement them from April 1st. Yesterday, it specially instructed the railway bureaus to comply with the order. The original order stated: "It is reported by the Joint Transportation Office that joint transportation of parcels is becoming increasingly developed, and many merchants have requested that fees be collected upon arrival. In response to social needs, five articles for the collection of joint transportation parcel fees upon arrival are proposed for review and approval." "After reviewing the proposed articles, they are considered appropriate and should be approved. It is decided to implement them from April 1st of this year. In addition to issuing separate orders, the relevant articles are hereby copied and issued for compliance and reporting." This order has been forwarded by the railway bureaus to the traffic department for compliance. The articles for the collection of joint transportation parcel fees upon arrival are recorded as follows: (1) The fees for joint transportation parcels may be collected by the arrival station from the receiver of the parcel after the parcel arrives, upon the request of the sender of the parcel. (2) The first, second, and third copies of the receipt for joint transportation parcels with fees collected upon arrival should be printed in red with the words "到付" (to be paid upon arrival) to indicate the difference. (The words "預付" (prepaid) in the receipt should be changed to "到付" (to be paid upon arrival).)

The accounting offices of each route shall also send them to the clearing division of the Joint Transportation Office for verification.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Founders Join Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the various party, government, transportation, and other circles in Shanghai initiated the preparation of the New Life Movement Promotion Association last week and elected Mayor Wu and others as preparatory members, the preparatory office has been opened at the Maple Bridge Local Autonomy Preparatory Office. In addition to actively carrying out the planned programs and publicity guidelines, they have also sent letters to various circles to solicit names to be listed as founders, and the number has reached more than 300 people. The origin of the association and the names of all the founders are recorded below.</p>
<p>Origin: What is "life"? In short, it is the "living" activity of human beings seeking "survival." The activities of human beings seeking survival can be roughly divided into eight categories: food, clothing, housing, transportation, work, education, entertainment, and communication. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, all human beings should have these kinds of lives. However, although all human beings have these kinds of lives, because of different times, different environments, different intelligence, and different morality, the spirit and form of their lives cannot be completely the same. Moreover, because of these differences in life, savagery and civilization are distinguished, and poverty and wealth are distinguished. Therefore, those who plan for the country must pay attention to the spirit and form of life and guide it favorably. From this, they create rites and music, establish various principles, and establish various norms to guide the lives of the people. Mr. Sun Yat-sen regarded life as the second element of national composition, and its importance can be imagined. Our country's ancient sages and worthies all paid great attention to their own lives. "The way of university is to illuminate virtue," and its program includes eight items: investigating things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world. Confucius said, "From the emperor to the common people, all are based on self-cultivation." As for the way of self-cultivation, although there are thousands of strands, they can all be summarized into the principles of "propriety," "righteousness," "integrity," and "shame." If the four words of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are interpreted in the modern sense, propriety is politeness, righteousness is chivalry, integrity is honesty, and shame is shame. If they are interpreted in the ancient sense, propriety does not exceed the limits, righteousness does not advance itself, integrity does not conceal evil, and shame does not follow injustice. Judging from these two meanings, the righteousness of modern people cannot be abolished, and the righteousness of ancient people is also very important. The lack of politeness is indeed a disease of modern society, and the abandonment of discipline and the destruction of order are even more harmful. The lack of a spirit of righteousness is indeed a cause for concern, and the trend of vain advancement is even more of a source of chaos. As for the discussion of integrity and shame, the growth of corruption actually begins with mutual concealment, and the extinction of a sense of shame is mostly due to mutual imitation. Both the ancient and modern meanings are very relevant to the current malpractices. If we can guide the lives of food, clothing, housing, transportation, work, education, entertainment, communication, etc., with the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame and put them into practice, then it will not only be self-cultivation. What is so difficult about regulating the family and governing the country? This is why the New Life Movement is so valuable. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of this, specially advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang and set "order" and "cleanliness" as the first phase of work, gradually reaching the goals of "education," "cultivation," and "hygiene." His intention is very strong. We are located in Shanghai, a ten-mile foreign field, and deeply feel the boredom of life. With the inspiration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, we are eager to actively improve and are willing to extend this to others to promote the progress of the New Life Movement. Therefore, our association initiates the New Life Movement as the basic work of revitalizing the nation and building the country. We hope that all our compatriots will participate in this initiative.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Arrest of Su's Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa's Concubine, Li Shuyun, Due to an Important Case</h3>
<p>Li and her daughter were apprehended in Xinmin Village with the assistance of the French Concession Police.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xu Pucheng and others escorted Li et al. to Wuxi Court.</p>
<p>丨 The Head of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau Refuses to Hand Over, Alleging Li as the Mastermind 丨</p>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the Chief of the Second Branch of the Wuxi Road District Public Security Bureau, was recently dismissed from his post. Relying on Li Shuyun, the concubine of Gu Renfa, the Civil Affairs Director of Jiangsu Province, as his shield, he refused to hand over his duties. Upon receiving the news, the Civil Affairs Department ordered the arrest of Li Shuyun to investigate the case. Li Shuyun and her daughter were apprehended in Shanghai a few days ago and escorted to Wuxi yesterday. The following is a detailed account of the events.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Dismissal: Liu Zhuomin, the Chief of the Second Branch of the Wuxi Road District Public Security Bureau, had been in office for five months. His management of the bureau was lackluster and ineffective, resulting in no achievements. Consequently, Li Wengong, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, suspended Liu from his duties and appointed Gao Chongshan, the current Chief of the First Branch, to fill the vacancy. However, Liu was appointed by the Civil Affairs Department, and his wife, Li Rongzhen, had sworn sisterhood with Li Shuyun, the concubine of Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa, forging a close relationship. Therefore, after receiving the suspension order from the County Public Security Bureau, Chief Liu immediately instructed his wife, Li Rongzhen, to report the news to Gu's concubine, Li Shuyun, in Zhenjiang, urgently requesting assistance.</p>
<p>Earnest Entreaties: Gu's concubine, Li Shuyun, learned that Director Gu had been summoned to the Nanchang Headquarters by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for training and had not yet returned to Zhenjiang. In her haste, she could not think of a solution, so she accompanied Secretary Xiao and left Zhenjiang immediately, arriving in Wuxi on the 14th and staying at the New World Hotel. When Liu Zhuomin heard the news, he and his wife went to greet them eagerly, treating them to a Western meal at a Western restaurant, accompanied by Peng Xiweng, the Chief of the Fifth Branch. During the meal, Liu earnestly pleaded with Li Shuyun to find a solution for him. Li agreed without hesitation and told Liu to relax and wait for Director Gu to return to the province and revoke the order.</p>
<p>Refusal to Hand Over: The next day, Li Shuyun left Wuxi for Shanghai. On the morning of the 15th, Director Li of the Public Security Bureau, knowing that the order had been issued for several days, ordered Inspector Zhang Yu to accompany the newly appointed Chief Gao Chongshan to take over the office. However, Liu Zhuomin, feeling confident, refused to hand over the office, saying, "Director Gu sent me here. If I am to be dismissed, I must wait for the Director's order to arrive before I hand over the office."</p>
<p>Armed Takeover: Inspector Zhang and others had no choice but to report the situation back to Director Li. Upon hearing this, Li was furious and immediately sent Yu Dichen, the Director of Education at the Police Training Institute, and Inspectors Liu Renyi and Fan Tianxing, along with Chief Gao, to take over the office by force. When they arrived at the bureau, Liu Zhuomin, seeing the unfavorable situation, hid and refused to appear. Only Liu's wife, Li Rongzhen, was there, making a scene, scolding wildly, even pounding on the table and stamping her feet, uttering constant insults.</p>
<p>Hiding Firearms: Chief Gao and others did not respond but immediately inspected everything in the bureau. Unexpectedly, all the seals and forty-four handguns in the bureau were missing. When they questioned the police officers in the bureau, they all said that Liu Zhuomin had hidden them. Chief Gao and others could not take over the office, so they reported to Director Li again. Li went to the county government and asked County Magistrate Yan for instructions. County Magistrate Yan ordered Chief Gao to handle the affairs first and to send Liu's wife to the county court for questioning if she continued to make trouble unreasonably. After receiving the order, Chief Gao went to take office first, and Ji Yaping, a staff member of the bureau, handed over various documents and files. As for the seals and firearms, they would wait for Liu to hand them over in person.</p>
<p>Arrest of Li Shuyun: Later, Liu Zhuomin received an order from the Civil Affairs Department to arrest him, and his wife, Li Rongzhen, was also arrested and escorted to the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the Wuxi County Court for interrogation. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Department considered that the mastermind of Liu's case was actually Li Shuyun, the second wife of Civil Affairs Director Gu Renfa. It was discovered that Li had fled to Shanghai with her mother, Mrs. Li (53 years old), and was hiding in the Huang residence at 15 Xinmin Village, Marlborough Road in the French Concession. Director Gu prepared a document, appointing Liu Anxi, the Director of the General Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Department, and Xu Pucheng, the Chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, to come to Shanghai on the 20th to report to the French Concession Police and request their assistance in arresting and bringing them back for interrogation.</p>
<p>Apprehending Mother and Daughter: The Detective Chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the Huang residence at 15 Xinmin Village, Marlborough Road, and arrest Li Shuyun and her mother, Mrs. Li. A search revealed no evidence of a crime, so they were taken back to the police station. According to Li Shuyun's statement, "Gu Renfa, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is my husband. I came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 13th because I was suffering from stomach problems and sought treatment from Dr. Kong at 419 on the fourth floor of the Continental Emporium. My husband went to Nanchang on the 12th to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. My husband would never denounce me. I know nothing about Liu Zhuomin's refusal to hand over his duties. I know Liu Zhuomin through the introduction of Liu's wife, Wen Rongzhen (not Li Rongzhen), because Liu used to be my husband's subordinate." Mrs. Li stated that she lived at 2 Zhaojia Ping, Changsha, and came with her daughter because she was ill. Based on the statements, the Detective Chief ordered them to be temporarily detained.</p>
<p>Police Opinion: The next day, they were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Changnian presided over the hearing. Li Shuyun had cut her hair short and was wearing a coffee-colored silk cheongsam and black satin shoes. After the judge questioned the defendants about their age, origin, and address, Li Shuyun occasionally showed a bitter smile. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, then stated the facts of the case, saying that the two defendants were reported to the police by Xu Pucheng, the Chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, and Liu Anxi, who were from the Civil Affairs Department, as being related to the case of Liu Zhuomin, the Chief of the Second Branch of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, hiding firearms and seals and refusing to hand over his duties. They requested that detectives be sent to assist in arresting them. However, when the detectives searched the defendants' residence, they found no evidence of a crime. Therefore, according to Article 7 of the Agreement, the police could not extradite them unless the formal court came to transfer them and there was sufficient evidence of the defendants' crimes. Now, the police's opinion is that the staff from the Civil Affairs Department should submit substantial evidence in the near future. Then the police do not oppose it. Moreover, the accuser in this case, Gu Renfa, is the current Civil Affairs Director of Jiangsu Province, also the husband of the first defendant. Since he has a close marital relationship with the defendant, the police should be more cautious.</p>
<p>Request for Transfer: Then, Xu Pucheng and Liu Anxi, the staff from the Civil Affairs Department, submitted an official document, requesting permission to transfer the two defendants back for interrogation. Liu Anxi also said that Li Shuyun was indeed Director Gu's wife and that she was selling official positions and extorting money. This time, Liu Zhuomin's refusal to hand over his duties was orchestrated by her. The Provincial Government had already reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and ordered her arrest. However, she took advantage of Gu's trip to Nanchang to meet with Chiang and fled to Shanghai. Therefore, the county magistrate sent them to Shanghai to report to the police for arrest and requested permission for the transfer. Li Shuyun stated that she knew nothing about Liu's case. Subsequently, Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, Tan Xinzhen, and other lawyers hired by the defendants successively expressed their opinions. The court then informed the staff that since Liu's case had been accepted by the Wuxi Court, this case should also be transferred by the Wuxi Court. The case is now being prepared by the Wuxi County Court Procuratorate, which has sent court police Yang Shuzi and Feng Yongbao to Shanghai to receive the transfer from the Second Special District Court this morning. The court immediately notified the police to escort the defendants to the court, where Judge Li opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. First, the police who came presented the official documents, requesting the transfer.</p>
<p>Mother and Daughter Weep Loudly: Then, Gu, the lawyer representing the police, stated that the extradition of criminals by government offices was stipulated in the agreement and requested the court to make a ruling in accordance with the law. When questioned, Li Shuyun stated that she graduated from the Zundao Association School in Changsha. Later, on June 22nd of the 20th year of the Republic of China, she married Gu Renfa, the current Civil Affairs Director of Jiangsu Province, through the introduction of Jin Xiufu. They were married at the Central Hotel in Hankou, with Li Yungong officiating the wedding and Ren Hebin presiding over it. After entering the family, she learned that Gu's ex-wife was still alive and had several children. When she questioned Gu, he said that it was related to his personal reputation and status and told her not to publicize it, saying that he had a way to divorce his ex-wife. Unexpectedly, this has now happened to harm me. I know nothing about Liu Zhuomin's case. The truth is that I have been wronged. After speaking, the mother and daughter covered their faces and wept loudly. Judge Li instructed that this case was a case of assistance and had been accepted by the Wuxi County Court first. The transfer should be approved. The defendant mother and daughter, upon hearing the instruction, cried even louder, saying, "If we are extradited, we fear that our lives will be harmed on the way." The court instructed, "If you have been wronged, the Wuxi County Court will also make a fair judgment and will not make things difficult for you. If you fear that there will be difficulties on the way, this court can send court police to accompany you." After the instruction, the court adjourned and the defendants were taken down to the court police room. The police who came hired a car and drove directly to the North Station to take a train to the Wuxi Court for further trial.</p>
<h3>Wang Haiqiu, Who Extorted Ma Zhanshan, Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang is Ma's subordinate</p>
<p>The court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, a famous anti-Japanese general in the Northeast, returned to China via the outer frontiers after running out of ammunition and supplies. After handing over his military seal, he retired in Tianjin. Last month, he suddenly received several threatening letters demanding money. Later, he received a small booklet about Ma Zhanshan, which contained words that damaged Ma's reputation. He then read an advertisement in the Shen Bao on January 28th, stating that "A Small History of Ma Zhanshan" was published by the Asia Translation Agency at 613 Route Lafayette in this city. After a secret investigation, he learned that Wang Changzhi was the person in charge. He then sent a letter to his secretary, You Ju, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu, to report to the French Concession Police a few days ago, presenting the threatening letters and a booklet, requesting an arrest and investigation. The political department dispatched Western detective Xi Neng (transliteration) and Chinese detective Zhao Zibo, who rushed to 613 Route Lafayette at 8:30 AM the day before yesterday. They saw a wooden sign with the name "Asia Translation Agency" hanging on the door. They entered and searched the premises, which turned out to be a Westerner's residence. They then arrested Wang Haiqiu (32 years old) from Liaoning on the second floor. They confiscated a letter signed by Ma Zhanshan, and a draft, a letter from Du Chongyuan to Du Yuesheng, a letter from Du Chongyuan to Ma Zhanshan, a letter to Ji Qing, and a letter to Ziyuan. They also removed the sign from the door and took it to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendant, Wang Haiqiu, was arrested based on a report by General Ma Zhanshan's representative, You Ju, to the police, and letters were confiscated as evidence. The police still need to conduct a detailed investigation and requested a seven-day extension to investigate the case. The evidence was presented to the court. When questioned, Wang Haiqiu stated that the Asia Translation Agency was run by Zhao Jianfeng, and he was the secretary, only responsible for receiving and sending letters and copying manuscripts, with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. He knew nothing about the booklet and threatening letters about Ma Zhanshan. Zhao used to be the director of the military supplies department under General Ma, and he was his old subordinate. Zhao has now left Shanghai for Nanjing, Beiping, or Hankou. The house at 613 Route Lafayette was rented until yesterday and has been returned. Detective Zhao Zibo reported that when they searched, the defendant took the letters from his pocket and threw them under the bed. The letters presented to the court were retrieved. You, the representative of General Ma, stated that General Ma received the letters and booklet in Tianjin. Xiang Xun, the lawyer hired by the defendant, stated that the defendant was currently ill and requested that he be released on bail or sent to a hospital for treatment during the extended period. The police opposed bail because the case was under investigation but requested that the court grant a shorter period. The defendant stated that he was suffering from hematuria and could not be released on bail, requesting permission to be sent to a hospital for treatment. The court approved the request and ordered a retrial on the 28th after the investigation. The defendant was temporarily detained by the police. The court also instructed the police detectives that if the defendant was indeed ill, he could be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the instruction, the court adjourned and the defendant was taken away by the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Daytime Robbery in Zhuhang Alley, Southern Shanghai, Apprehended</h3>
<p>An old man gathered for mahjong, the daughter-in-law opened the door, and thieves entered.</p>
<p>Neighbors heard the commotion and called the police. The two thieves confessed, but their statements diverged.</p>
<p>Shen Jingzhou, 67, from Gaoqiao, Pudong, is the general manager of Yichang Qianzhuang on Huayi Street, outside Dadongmen, Nanshi. He lives at 169 Zhuhang Alley, near the Qianzhuang. Because the Qianzhuang is prosperous and has annual surpluses, Shen's family has accumulated a lot of wealth, the furnishings are luxurious, and life is comfortable, attracting the attention of bandits. Yesterday, after lunch, Shen was bored at home and invited his local co-resident, Xu Lingtao, and others to play mahjong. At 2:35 PM, they suddenly heard a very urgent knock on the door. Shen's daughter-in-law went out to ask who was knocking. She heard someone outside the door say, "I am from Yichang Qianzhuang, sending a note to Mr. Shen." The daughter-in-law thought it was the old clerk from Yichang Qianzhuang and did not suspect anything else, so she opened the door. Unexpectedly, after opening the door, she saw three people standing outside, none of whom were from Yichang Qianzhuang, and their faces were ferocious. Knowing that they were not good people, she quickly tried to close the door, but the three people pushed the door open with force, barged into Shen's house, took out guns, drove Shen's daughter-in-law and Xu Lingtao, who were playing mahjong, to a corner, and forbade them from making any noise. They sternly asked Shen and others, "We are under orders to search for opium." After saying this, they searched Shen's daughter-in-law and took 16 silver dollars from her pocket, putting them into their bags. At this time, Shen and others realized that they were bandits and were all panic-stricken. The bandits left one bandit to watch Shen and others, while two bandits went upstairs straight into the bedroom, overturning boxes and cabinets and looting wildly. Unexpectedly, Shen Dizhuang, a resident of 173, the house next door to Shen's family, heard the commotion and quickly ran out to call the watchmen Zhuang Maojin of the sixth gang and Zhang Quanan of the seventh gang to come and guard the door of Shen's house. At the same time, they used the telephone to report to the First Section of the First District and asked for assistance in the arrest. The section dispatched Inspector Guo Qingchong, leading Sergeants Zhang Fengjun, Zhu Lianqing, Police Officers Zhang Zide, Pu Yongchang, Li Mingyang, Li Jingzhai, Ji Yintang, Detective Yu Maolong, and more than twenty others, all armed, and rushed to the address. They surrounded Shen's house like they were facing a formidable enemy. Passersby on the road did not understand the truth and were greatly frightened, scattering and fleeing in all directions. The bandit who was watching Shen and others had noticed that the police detectives had arrived outside to arrest them. He pretended to be calm, hid the gun in his pocket, opened the door, and walked out slowly, hoping to avoid the eyes and ears of the detectives and police and not be suspected as a bandit. However, the detectives outside the door saw that his clothing was improper and knew that he was not a good person, so they arrested him. The bandit repeatedly stated that he was not a robber. The police searched him and found a Browning pistol with serial number 677 and six bullets. The bandit then lowered his head and was speechless. At that time, Inspector Guo saw that one bandit had already been arrested and led the police detectives to rush into Shen's house, straight up the stairs. They saw one bandit still looting property in the bedroom and rushed forward to arrest him. They found 11 silver dollars and a Browning pistol with serial number 63 and seven bullets on his person. However, one bandit had already escaped and was not captured. The two bandits were taken back to the section. When Section Chief Yi interrogated them, one confessed that his name was Lu Zixiang, 38 years old, from Chongming. This time, the robbery of Shen's house was initiated by Wang Amao, a native of Chuansha, who lived at 8, Lane 2, Runan Lane, opposite the Xiaocai Market in the Zhabei Public Welfare Lane. There were a total of six people who went to commit the robbery, all of whom were invited by Wang. Three people were scattered outside the door to keep watch. Lu Zixiang and Lu Bu'ao, who were arrested at the same time, broke into Shen's house and were arrested by the police. All the guns were also given to them by Wang Amao at the Gongan Inn on Wuma Road at about 9:00 PM last night (the night before last) to be used for the robbery. When questioned, Lu Bu'ao confessed that he was 30 years old, from Haimen. He was also invited by Wang Amao to commit the robbery, but he did not know Wang's residence. He did not know Lu Zixiang before. Last night, he went to the Gongan Inn to discuss the robbery because he was invited by Wang and met Zixiang. He met and knew each other through Wang's introduction. The section then dispatched Squad Leader Dong Mingde, Han Ruisheng, and Detectives Yuan Haishan and Wang Guilin to accompany the bandit Lu Zixiang to Zhabei and, together with the chief police of the First Section of the Fourth District, rushed to Runan Lane. The bandit Lu pointed out and arrested one person and took him back to the section. When the section chief questioned him, the person confessed that his name was Liu Yushan, 47 years old, from Shandong. He had been working as a police officer in the Haining Road Police Station for more than ten years. "I am not Wang Amao, nor am I from Chuansha. I don't know the two bandits, Lu, either. Last night (the night before last) from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, I was assigned to guard a warehouse on Arabasta Road. How could I have had the time to go to the Gongan Inn to conspire with Lu and others to rob Shen's house? Today, I was sitting at home when the detectives came and arrested me, saying that I was a robber. I was really confused, but I don't know why I was falsely accused by the bandit Lu." However, the bandit Lu Zixiang insisted that the person was his accomplice Wang Amao. When questioned, Lu Bu'ao said that the person was definitely not Wang Amao, because he knew Wang well. As to whether Liu Yushan was Wang Amao or was falsely accused by Lu and others with the intention of framing him, further investigation is still needed. An official document was ordered to be prepared and the three captured criminals were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation this morning.</p>
<h3>Sisters Jointly Sue Stepmother</h3>
<p>Filing a lawsuit to divide the property.</p>
<p>Shen Xiaomao, a native of this county, started as a farmer and owned a lot of real estate in Shanghai. He first married a woman surnamed Mou, who bore him two daughters, the elder named Xin'e and the younger named Lin'e. After Mou died of illness, Shen remarried a woman surnamed Li, who bore him a son and two daughters. The son, named Fugeng, died young. The two daughters were named Fudi and Meidi. Shen died of illness in 1928, leaving behind real estate including 1.7 acres of land at Minhou North Village, Hartung Road, 1.67 acres of land at Jiangjiajiao, 3 acres of houses and land in Sanjingbang City, Zhoujiaqiao, 1 acre of land at Zhanghongqiao, and 2 acres of land near the Hongqiao Airport, as well as cash, totaling no less than 150,000 yuan, all managed by Li. Last year, when Xin'e married into the Zhou family, Li was perfunctory. She also abused Lin'e in every way, causing Lin'e to be unable to live in peace and to leave home and temporarily live with the Qi family. Xin'e and Lin'e then hired lawyer Che Bingrong to send a letter to Li, seeking a division of property. However, Li kept delaying, and they had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, requesting the entire estate to be divided into five parts in accordance with Articles 1164 and 1138 of the Civil Code, with the plaintiffs receiving two-fifths of the estate. Because they were unable to pay the litigation fees, they requested litigation assistance, which was approved. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi of the First Special Court opened the Eleventh Civil Court for hearing. The defendant, Shen Li, argued that the entire estate left by Shen Xiaomao was only worth 17,000 yuan, and that it was divided immediately after her husband's death, with each of the two plaintiffs receiving 2,500 yuan. However, the plaintiffs denied this, saying that the defendant had sold a piece of land and obtained more than 10,000 yuan, and the defendant gave them each 500 yuan as funds for other uses. The division of property was purely fictitious. After questioning, the court ordered a postponement for further verification.</p>
<h3>A Woman Who Has Been Separated for a Long Time Sues to Confirm the Mother-Son Relationship</h3>
<p>Feng Qiting, who was once poor, is now rich.</p>
<p>The woman is unable to support herself and the son should be ordered to provide support.</p>
<p>丨 Feng Admits Cohabitation, Denies Having a Son 丨</p>
<p>Feng Qiting, 53, from Baoding, Hebei Province, has been doing business in this city. In 1914 and 1915, he met a young woman surnamed Yang and began cohabiting with her. After several years, Feng, due to economic difficulties and being unable to provide for her, separated from the woman. Since then, they have been estranged and Yang has found another place to live. For many years, there has been no communication. In recent years, Feng's business has prospered and he has established Hengji Leather Goods Store in Shanjia Garden and is also the manager of a carpet company downstairs at Jinlong Western Restaurant on Tibet Road. Yang, feeling old and facing difficult circumstances, has a haggard face and no one to pity her. She learned that Feng has become rich, which touched her past feelings. She then hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, saying that she had a son named Amao when she cohabited with Feng. Later, they separated and the son was taken by Feng to raise. It has been nineteen years now. She is now old and unable to make a living and should be supported by her own son. She requested a judgment confirming that she and Feng Amao have a mother-son relationship. However, Amao is still a minor and Feng Qiting is Amao's legal guardian, so she specifically listed Qiting as a defendant as well, requesting that he be summoned together. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai held a trial. Feng Qiting, accompanied by his representative lawyer Jiang Yiping, appeared in court. Lawyer Jiang raised the issue of jurisdiction, saying that Feng Qiting's residence was in his hometown and that his son's name was Xiaomao, not Amao, and that he was also in his hometown and had been adopted by the eldest son. He requested that this issue be resolved first before the content of the case could be heard. The plaintiff's representative lawyer then said that Feng Qiting has been doing business in the Public Concession and his residence is in his leather goods store. Since he is Amao's legal guardian, this case should be under the jurisdiction of this court and there is no question of jurisdiction. Judge Luo then questioned Feng Qiting, who stated that he lived in the countryside of Baoding and had a leather goods store and a carpet company in Shanghai. In 1915, he cohabited with the plaintiff, but Xiaomao was not born to the plaintiff and was adopted by his brother and sister-in-law at the age of twelve with his father's permission. However, according to the plaintiff Feng Yang, she cohabited with Feng in 1915 and gave birth to a son in 1916, named Amao. The midwife was called by Feng, and the landlord Ge Debao knew this very well. She requested that Ge be summoned to court to prove it. Later, Feng had no money and she supplied everything, costing thousands of yuan. Feng took Amao away when he was six years old. In recent years, he was studying at Nanyang School. Feng hid him because she asked for this son. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation as it still needed to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Charity Group Jointly Provides Congee Relief for Fire Victims</h3>
<p>Recently, two major fires occurred in Zhabei, on Pushan Road and Jingjiang Road, burning down hundreds of thatched houses. The victims numbered in the thousands, mostly laborers. The Chinese Red Cross Society and the Xinwei Relief Society distributed rice tickets, silver dollars, and old clothes to the victims. The Chinese Jisheng Association and the Zhabei Charity Group jointly distributed congee, starting on March 13th at Liuying Road, distributing congee with vouchers, three spoonfuls for adults and two spoonfuls for children, requiring more than eleven dan of congee rice per day. Nearly 3,000 people have been given congee for eleven days. The suffering victims were grateful. The emergency relief was quite difficult in terms of financial resources. They are now trying to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from the Jishēng Hui Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>The China Jishēng Hui moved into its new premises at No. 20 Gùjiānòng, Níngbō Road on February 28th. The first meeting was held the day before yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Deputy Chairmen Xú Qiánlín and Huáng Hánzhī, and Standing Committee member Zhū Qìchén. Chairman Wáng Yītíng was absent due to illness, so Deputy Chairmen Xú and Huáng presided. The minutes of the previous meeting were read, followed by a report from Director Zhènwù, Mr. So-and-so, regarding joint efforts with the Zháběi Charity Group to provide porridge at two large disaster relief sites on Jīngjiāng Road and Pǔshàn Road in Zháběi; spring relief in Ānhuī's Fùyáng, Yǐngshàng, and Tàihé counties in cooperation with the Huáng Hé Flood Emergency Relief Association; work relief for the Guangfeng embankment and small embankment projects in Jiangxi; porridge distribution at the Chaoyangmen outside Beijing and at the Báiyī'ān porridge factory; grain distribution by the Cháng'ān branch in Shǎnxī; and emergency relief in Fujian in conjunction with the Eight Virtues Association. These efforts require substantial funds, so everyone's attention is requested. Furthermore, Director of Finance, Mr. So-and-so, reported that from January 1st to March 19th of this year, a total of 19,417.55 yuan was received in relief funds, and a total of 13,976.52 yuan was paid out. The Guangfeng embankment project in Jiangxi and the Liǔyíng Road porridge factory in Zháběi still have unpaid relief funds of 5,000-6,000 yuan. Currently, the market is sluggish, and income is not covering expenses. Water disasters are repeatedly occurring in Henan, Hebei, and western Shandong, with suffering people everywhere. With a compassionate heart, we should do everything we can for relief efforts. Last year, more than 17,000 yuan was spent on medicine. Now, in this time when the epidemic has not completely subsided, various places rely on our association's medicine, and its use is becoming more widespread. This year, about 20,000 yuan will be needed for medicine. Please discuss together how to provide relief, and with a sense of conscience, plan for expansion. We should also publicly nominate several comrades with a well-established reputation to serve on our association's standing committee, seeking their guidance and assistance to aid relief efforts. At this time of moral decline and popular demoralization, we should actively promote and attempt to remedy the situation and prevent disasters.</p>

<h3>Meeting of Christian Organizations to Promote Rural Revival</h3>
<p>The Commission on the Thrust of Christian Institutions of the National Christian Council of China, located at No. 169 Yuánmíngyuán Road, held a meeting at its offices the other day. Committee members included Mr. Zhào Jìnqīng, Dr. Lǐ Dēnghuī, Mr. Chén Lìtíng, Mr. Chén Zōngliáng, Mr. Zhū Lìdé, etc. After detailed discussion by the attending committee members, they concluded that in this time of rural economic collapse, if the intention is to assist various churches in becoming self-supporting, the first priority should be assisting farmers in various places to improve agricultural products and various side occupations, and to promote cooperatives, in order to achieve the goal of revitalizing the rural economy. However, this matter is extensive in scope and the problems are complex. It has now been decided that further meetings are required to allow for proactive implementation.</p>
<h3>The Unprinted National Gazetteer: Jiaqing Revised Unified Gazetteer</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press reprints from manuscript.</p>
<p>An important work in the Continued Compilation of the Four Series.</p>
<p>The Qīng Unified Gazetteer was first printed in the ninth year of the Qiánlóng reign, in 356 volumes. It was revised and printed in the 55th year, increasing to 424 volumes. Reduced-size editions of these two books have been available on the market, but the number of volumes has varied, greatly distorting the original appearance of the book. This time, the Commercial Press is reprinting the third revision from the late Qīng dynasty, ending in the 25th year of the Jiāqìng reign, completed in the 22nd year of the Dàoguāng reign. It begins with a catalog in two volumes, followed by 511 volumes covering the capital and various provinces, followed by 34 volumes covering Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, the Western Regions, and dependent territories, plus 11 volumes covering tributary states, totaling 562 volumes. It contains tables of historical changes for each province and department, tables of prefectures, departments, and sub-prefectures, a complete map, provincial maps, maps of prefectures, departments, and sub-prefectures, and maps of various departments. The contents are divided into twenty-five categories: territory, regional divisions, establishment and evolution of administrative divisions, topography, customs, city walls, schools, population, land taxes, tax revenues, official positions, mountains and rivers, historical sites, passes, ferries and bridges, dikes and embankments, mausoleums, ancestral temples, temples and monasteries, famous officials, historical figures, exiles, virtuous women, immortals and monks, and local products. The analysis is meticulous, more detailed than the Qiánlóng revision. Omissions and errors in the original have been corrected. It is the most detailed and comprehensive official gazetteer ever produced. The entire book consists of more than 13,700 leaves. At the time, it was only presented as a manuscript and never printed. The Commercial Press borrowed the original book from the Qing History Museum, photographed it, and is publishing it as part of the first installment of the Continued Compilation of the Four Series, scheduled for publication on April 1st. Due to the large number of volumes, the Wáng Yúnwǔ Four-Corner Number Indexing Method has been used to create an index for ease of reference. It is an essential reference for those studying Chinese geography. It is reported that the complete book consists of 200 volumes, plus 10 index volumes, and is sold separately for 110 yuan per set, 10% discount for cash payment. Those who pre-order the complete set of the first installment of the Continued Compilation of the Four Series, in addition to this book, will also receive 300 volumes of other Song and Yuan editions for a pre-order price of only 150 yuan, an increase of only 51 yuan, an extremely rare opportunity. It is learned that in order to facilitate those who only wish to purchase the Unified Gazetteer, the deadline for pre-ordering the complete set of the first installment of the Continued Compilation of the Four Series has been extended by ten days, to April 10th, and a sample of the Unified Gazetteer has been specially printed for reference.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders All Banks to Prohibit the Imitation of Banknotes in Gift Certificates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently stated that the issuance of gift certificates by banks originally served as a type of deposit certificate, facilitating social interactions and gift-giving, which was acceptable. However, the design of some gift certificates printed by various banks resembled banknotes, inevitably creating the suspicion of profiting from counterfeiting. Therefore, the ministry had generally deleted the terms "gift certificates" and "savings" from the registered articles of association of various banks, as a measure to ensure the integrity of certificates and prevent abuses. However, it has been discovered that some banks still issue gift certificates under their savings departments without prior approval, which is improper. Therefore, a special notice has been issued stating that in the future, banks must first submit an application to the ministry for approval before issuing gift certificates. Those that have already issued gift certificates must submit one sample of each type of gift certificate to the ministry for approval within three days of receiving the order, in order to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in South America Welcome Domestic Films for Screening</h3>
<p>According to a message from the Guidance Division of the International Trade Bureau, overseas Chinese in South America regret that only American films have been screened in various places in South America, and no domestic films have been brought there. Therefore, overseas Chinese there deeply hope that the International Trade Bureau will introduce domestic films to be screened as soon as possible, which can enhance overseas Chinese awareness of the motherland, and can also allow people in that country to understand Chinese society. The Bureau also received a letter from Zhāng Ruìpéng, an overseas Chinese in Dutch Guiana, South America, volunteering to manage the introduction of domestic films from various domestic film companies and screen them in cinemas in South America and the West Indies. Therefore, the Bureau has notified major film companies in Shanghai, such as Star, Lianhua, and Tianyi, to provide detailed information on transaction procedures, prices, and film titles, in order to forward them to the businessman for promotion.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the China Dental Protection Association</h3>
<p>The China Dental Protection Association at No. 47 Níngbō Road in this city, initiated and organized by Wáng Zhèngyán, Hé Qígǒng, Hè Yàozǔ, Zhào Pīlián, Wáng Xiǎolài, Pān Gōngzhǎn, Yáng Xiàotiān, Wáng Yītíng, Tài Rùnqīng, Yú Zuǒtíng, Fāng Jiāobó, Zhāng Shēnzhī, Yīng Yǒngfēng, etc., has made rapid progress. The association sent letters to enthusiastic people from all walks of life who are concerned about public welfare and hygiene, inviting them to become directors, and invited domestic physicians with profound medical skills to become consultants. In recent days, it has received praise and letters of joining, numbering in the thousands. There are even more people requesting the charter and wishing to join as members. All sectors attach such importance to dental hygiene. It is not without reason that our people recognize dental protection as a way to prevent disease and strengthen the race, and also as a means of beauty. The humiliation of the "sick man of East Asia" is not entirely removed, and it is also evident that the association's urgent plan is imperative. It is reported that the association is sparing no effort in its internal equipment and layout, and the charter is still being printed. Once preparations are complete, it will go out and serve. If all sectors have inquiries, the association's telephone number is 15930, and it will provide answers.</p>
<h3>Péngchǎng Temple to Hold Regular Tower Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>Péngchǎng Temple, located at the eastern end of Hóngqiáo Town in western Shanghai, recently had farmers Zhāng Jūnsheng, Wáng Yǒuxiāng, etc., initiate the erection of a tower lantern pole celebration, scheduled to be held on the 31st of this month, and the 1st and 2nd of April, for three days. Currently, more than 100 people are announcing it to the public around the temple grounds every day. The chief of the 1st sub-precinct of the 6th district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Chief Hóng, has posted a notice prohibiting it because it is related to superstition, but it is feared that it will not be effective. Otherwise, the local area will inevitably spend money, amounting to more than 20,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses This Year's Finances</h3>
<p>The Municipal General Rates Will Remain at 14 Percent</p>
<p>A Shortfall of 1.9 Million Will Be Made Up From the Reserve Fund</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 21st of this month, the Director of Finance reported that the budget for this year had been largely completed and would be submitted to the Finance Committee for review in the coming days. The most important point for the Council to consider was the issue of the Municipal General Rates. According to the figures compiled, the total expenditure under the regular budget for this year, 1934, is 26,385,000 yuan, while the total estimated income is 24,431,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 1,950,000 yuan, equivalent to about two quarters of the revenue from the Municipal General Rates. How to make up for this shortfall of 1.95 million yuan requires urgent consideration. The budgets for 1932 and 1933 both had shortfalls, which were made up from the reserve fund, the former being 1,225,000 taels and the latter reaching 1,500,000 taels. Whether or not to revert to the old Municipal General Rates (16 percent) this year should be carefully considered in light of the current situation in Shanghai. As for properties subject to the rates, since 1931, due to new construction and re-equalization of valuations, their valuation has increased by 16 million yuan. Now that the valuations are largely equalized, the timing of the rate increase depends on the Council's decision. In recent years, due to the sale of the Electricity Department, taxpayers have enjoyed the benefit of reduced rates, but it has been difficult to balance the budget. However, given the obviously difficult general economic situation, it is advisable to adopt a method that can avoid raising rates if possible in a normal year. There are still remaining funds in the General Reserve Fund, and it is proposed to allocate another 2,000,000 yuan, as in the past two years, to make up the shortfall. After allocating 2 million yuan as proposed, the current General Reserve Fund, which is the remainder from the reorganization of the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department, will have a remaining balance of about 550,000 yuan. After discussion, the Council deeply felt that the current expenditure of the Municipal Council was actually exceeding the regular income, but was very pleased that there was a way to delay the rate increase for another year and avoid submitting it to the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting this year. The proposal by the Director of Finance to allocate 2 million yuan from the General Reserve Fund to maintain a balanced budget was approved for implementation.</p>
<h3>Mechanical Industry Federation Petitions for Increased Import Duties on Rubber Tape</h3>
<p>Japanese Goods Dumped, Domestic Inventory Piles Up</p>
<p>The Mechanical Industry Federation of this city, due to the dumping of Japanese rubber tape at low prices, specially petitioned the National Government and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting an increase in import duties and the imposition of anti-dumping duties. The original petition stated: "Regarding the dumping of Japanese rubber tape at low prices, which greatly affects domestic products, we respectfully petition for an increase in import tax rates or the implementation of anti-dumping duties to remedy the situation. We respectfully submit a letter from our member, Shen Yi Rubber Tape Factory, stating that in order to recover lost profits, we first raised funds to establish a factory to manufacture domestic rubber tape. Various Shen Yi brand narrow and wide rubber tapes have already been manufactured, specifically for use in domestic factories' machinery. They have been sold in the market for half a year now and have been well received by the factory sector in various places. We have recently been working hard to improve the manufacturing methods in order to refine and develop them, so as to effectively resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, since the products were launched and sold last year, Japanese rubber tape has been sold at low prices, and domestic goods have gradually been affected. Upon investigation, the tax levied on imports from Japan is very low in our country, only 14.25 per 100, which has led to a large number of Japanese rubber tapes coming to China, wielding their ambition of economic aggression and using their harsh tactic of dumping at low prices. For example, Japanese rubber tape is sold for only 1.3 cents per layer per inch when transported and sold in our country. According to its domestic sales price, it should be sold for 2 cents per layer per inch. The cost of domestic rubber tape is 1.5 cents per layer per inch, which is slightly different from the dumping price of Japanese rubber</p>
<p>tape. However, factory fees, etc., have not been added to our factory's products, and promotion has been greatly affected. Inventory is piling up, and the situation is worrying. This kind of dumping behavior is a fatal blow to domestic rubber tape, and the harm to the industry is extremely serious. May we ask, the Earth Brand, Double Deer Brand, Head Brand, etc., listed in hardware and grocery stores such as Beijing Road Mantingfang in Shanghai are all Japanese goods, and the above-mentioned selling prices are still consignment prices. If wholesale in large quantities, the price is even cheaper. If this continues, not only will workers suffer from unemployment, but the only rubber tape factory in Shanghai will be in danger of being unable to recover. Upon investigation, the Japanese government uses military force to invade neighboring countries, and also adopts a policy of economic aggression to support or subsidize its domestic and foreign manufacturing factories in order to compete with our fledgling domestic products. If remedies are not quickly sought, or measures are not taken to ban them, what unimaginable consequences will there be? We have always known that your association has the goal of protecting domestic products and resisting foreign goods, so we have specially listed the situation of enemy goods and sent a letter to request that you submit it to the government for practical guarantees, and instruct the customs to increase the import tax rate on rubber tape, so as to avoid exploitation and benefit domestic goods. The letter states that the selling price of Japanese rubber tape, as stated by the factory, is different domestically and abroad, which shows that there is dumping, and that our country's import tariff is only 14.25 percent, which is too low. It is reasonable to forward the situation as it is, and we respectfully request that your ministry consider and verify whether to impose an anti-dumping tax or increase the import tax rate, in order to remedy the situation and benefit domestic products. We cannot wait to submit this."</p>

<h3>Newly Arrived Automatic Photo Booth</h3>
<p>New type, quick, can take six photos per minute.</p>
<p>Pilot testing in the Temple of Confucius Park and prosperous urban areas.</p>
<p>Although the photography industry in Shanghai is extremely developed, it is time-consuming and expensive, and has not been popularized among the general public. Recently, Gù Shìdé spent a huge sum of more than 100,000 yuan to order ten automatic photo booths from a famous British factory. The machine is a recent invention, and its internal structure is unusually exquisite and its equipment is very perfect. When taking a photo, you only need to turn on the motor and the machine will automatically take the photo. The photographer can move and express themselves at will. Within one minute, you can take six photos of various different poses, and you can get them immediately. It can be said to be the latest and fastest camera in modern times, and each set of six photos only costs five cents for the raw materials. Mr. Gù has now applied for and received permission from the Education Bureau. In addition to setting up one in the Temple of Confucius Park and the prosperous areas of the city, he will also set up one in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, and other ports to facilitate the general public.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Study the Northeast Issue (4)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this column provided a general discussion of the overall method for this issue. Today, we will continue with a concrete examination, starting with the first set of opposing factors. Editor</p>
<p>First, let us start by examining the first set of opposing factors.</p>
<p>The opposition between imperialist powers has become increasingly blatant since the world economic crisis began in 1929. As the crisis deepened, the field of struggle expanded universally and became white-hot. This struggle is reflected in the Northeast in the form of two lines of struggle: one line is led by Japan, which seeks to monopolize the interests of Manchuria, and the other line is led by the United States, which seeks to maintain the "Open Door Policy" and "territorial integrity." The attitude of the League of Nations countries (excluding Japan, of course) at that time was also in favor of the latter, as it was deemed more advantageous. As for the other imperialist powers, they had fewer interests at stake, and their opinions ultimately could not become the main ones, so we will not discuss them for the time being. The outbreak of this struggle was naturally inevitable, but its outbreak in 1930 was entirely due to the economic crisis and the political crisis it spawned, which provided a new stimulus for the Japanese financial bourgeoisie (I say financial bourgeoisie rather than Japanese militarists because the Japanese militarists are merely tools of the financial bourgeoisie; the Japanese military is acting on the orders of these financial magnates) to use colonial aggression wars to resolve the domestic economic crisis and alleviate the political crisis. At that time, the overall relationship between international imperialist powers was also undergoing a comprehensive shift and disintegration from relative equilibrium due to the deepening of the crisis, which gave Japan a superior position. Thus, Japan used the call for anti-Sovietism (which will be discussed in detail below), and the "September 18th Incident" was born as a result.</p>
<p>This change naturally alarmed the entire world. It was the beginning of a reorganization of the forces of imperialism in the Pacific and the signal for World War II.</p>
<p>Looking back at the development of this set of opposing factors over the past three years, we can already see that Japan, at least on its part, has achieved a breakthrough in the past equilibrium and shattered the "joint management" line of the United States and the League of Nations. Until recently, the facts have shown that Japan's line has been developing throughout the entire territory of China, and the League of Nations itself has produced Japan's line. For example, following Manchuria, there was the autonomy of Inner Mongolia, the independence of southern Xinjiang, the occupation of the Nine Islands, the invasion of Tibetan troops, the seizure of Yunnan mines, etc., which indicates a shift from the joint management line to a line of partition. The recent establishment of a new understanding between the United States and Japan cannot be regarded as accidental. It is merely a manifestation of the development of this set of opposing factors in the Far East, along with the ebb and flow of the international struggle led by the two powers of Britain and the United States. If the Ten-Nation Conference on the Pacific can truly be successfully convened next year, then that may be the complete victory of Japan's line (implementing the partition of China), but it is not Japan's victory. What follows is a war of division that will inevitably break out as a result of this line, and the result will still be war. Although we are not as bold as the British writer Wells in making some pointless predictions to scare people, the Northeast issue cannot be separated from the development of this set of opposing factors, and we dare to say with certainty that we have grasped the development trend of this set of opposing factors.</p>
<p>Many upper-class Chinese, seeing this set of opposing factors, develop a mentality of relying on the League of Nations or the United States, wanting to play the old trick of "using barbarians to control barbarians," and still wanting to restore the emasculated equilibrium. When things do not go as they wish, they fantasize about "same race and same culture" and "Pan-Asianism," completely recognizing thieves as fathers. In addition, many enthusiastic young people, seeing Japan's management of Manchuria, weep and lament that "the hearts of the people will be lost" and that "the Northeast will be impossible to recover in ten years." This is all because they do not understand the development of this set of opposing factors in a dynamic way, or they only see temporary phenomena and mistakenly believe that they are unchanging, or they see Japan's temporary prosperity in managing Manchuria in isolation, forgetting that the world economic crisis is ubiquitous and that Manchuria, even if it is temporarily prosperous, cannot be an exception. Moreover, how can Japan make Manchuria prosperous at present? Didn't Mr. Fang say "poisoning policy"? What is the basis of this "poisoning policy"? We cannot agree with the opinion implied by Mr. Fang that it is entirely based on the ethical concept of national slaughter. It is clearly a kind of abnormal production under the economic crisis after the bankruptcy of colonial agriculture. Japan clearly cannot save Manchuria from the economic crisis (especially the agricultural crisis), just as it cannot resolve the crisis in its own country. Japan's agricultural products are already in surplus, and it will never allow Manchuria's agriculture to develop regularly. Therefore, there is the act of forcing farmers to grow tobacco. This is by no means defending Japan. This is to say that if the world market needs wheat and soybeans at this time, Japanese capitalists will never forget this normal and profitable production and engage in this immoral business. In the "business经" of merchants, making a profit is clearly the only principle. The so-called national hatred, if separated from the plunder of "wealth," Japanese capitalists would probably feel meaningless! This nakedly exposes the bankruptcy of the rural areas of Northeast China, Japan's inability to prosper the Northeast, Japan's inability to save the Northeast from jumping out of the crisis, and the daily deterioration of the lives of the people in the Northeast. What is lurking here is the spark of resistance that will be ignited by the desire for survival, not submission to Japan and forgetting China. At the same time, this fate is not determined by Japan; it is the inevitable fruit of the capitalist system. Therefore, Mr. Fang's worries, although stemming from patriotism, have become harmful pessimism because he removed other factors when observing.</p>
<p>There are also many observers who can generally grasp the principles of this set of opposing factors, but do not want to incorporate new events that are changing in order to absorb new materials and enrich the content of their research. For example, everyone seems a little excited about the recent reform of the Manchurian state, but they are silent about the independence of southern Xinjiang and the autonomy of Mongolia. Their understanding of the national crisis is limited to the "September 18th Incident" stage and cannot link these new events of the same essence together to recognize the seriousness of the "Northeast Incident" in these new events.</p>
<p>In short: This set of opposing factors is still developing. Before the expansion and victory of the Chinese national liberation war, it still has a decisive effect on the Northeast issue, and we still deserve to pay attention to it from time to time. (To be continued)</p>

As of today, all six colleges of Peiping University have been inspected. They plan to complete the inspection of all colleges and universities in Peiping before the end of this month. As for the degree of progress made by the various colleges of Peiping University after the reorganization, since the six commissioners had not inspected them before, it is not easy to compare at this moment. However, according to insiders familiar with Peiping University, Peiping University has been on the right track for the past six months.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Scope and Organizational Law of Graduation Exams</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the Shanghai Medical College's request for clarification regarding the scope of graduation examinations and their organizational methods, specifically instructed the college, stating that the organizational methods for the Graduation Examination Committee had already been clearly outlined in the Ministry's Order No. 13328 of the previous year. As for the scope of the graduation examinations, they should be conducted in accordance with Article 17, Paragraph 2 of the University Regulations (the graduation examination is the final semester examination, but the subjects examined must be more than four, with at least two covering the entire academic year). However, the medical college's duration of study is five years, and an internship of one year is required after completion.

<h3>Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee</h3>
<p>Requests for Subsidies from All Parties Cannot Be Met Due to Lack of Funds</p>
<p>The Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee held a standing committee meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, the 12th meeting of the Chinese delegation at 11:00 AM, and a joint Sino-Belgian conference at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members: From the Chinese side, Chairman Chu Minyi, Vice Chairman Zeng Zongjian, Committee Members Li Zhaoshuai, Zhu Shiquan, Kong Lihang, Cai Hong; Attending Secretaries Liu Xichang, Nong Ruhui, Tian Shoucheng; Accountant Pan Zhaobang. From the Belgian side, Chairman Lang Peian, Vice Chairman Le Garre, Committee Members Aelles, Bu Song, and Teflan Shuier; Attending Secretary Lan Bo; Chairman Lang Peian.</p>
<p>Meeting Details: (A) Reporting Items: (1) The Chinese delegation reported on the work situation in the 22nd year; (2) Belgian Committee Member Aelles reported on the process of handling overseas study affairs in Belgium; (3) Committee Member Kong Lihang reported on the situation of inspecting students studying in Belgium; (4) Report of the Sino-Belgian Sanatorium; (5) Accountant Pan reported on the accounts. (B) Discussion Items: (1) The Executive Yuan Secretariat sent a letter requesting the compilation of a budget and attending a joint meeting of Boxer Indemnity agencies. It was resolved to recommend Committee Members Zhu Shiquan and Kong Lihang to attend; (2) University Thesis Award Fund: it was resolved to continue holding the event with the remaining funds of 1,300 yuan from last year's award fund; (3) Unpaid debts of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and Lincheng Coal Mine Company: it was resolved that the General Assembly would send a letter to demand payment; (4) Belgian Committee Member Aelles proposed that studying in Belgium must first be reviewed by the committee, which was resolved and passed; (5) Various requests for subsidies: the Sino-Belgian delegations received dozens of requests for subsidies from all parties, but the committee's large share of funds had already been fully allocated. Currently, only a small amount of funds are available each year, which, in addition to the operating expenses of the two delegations, leaves very little. Therefore, it is impossible to allocate them. The Belgian committee members believe that the institutions previously subsidized by the Chinese delegation do not entirely belong to the Sino-Belgian nature. Therefore, this review of each case is extremely serious, but in reality, there are no funds available for subsidies. There are two reasons for this: firstly, the committee's funds are decreasing year by year, and secondly, due to the impact of the depreciation of the US dollar. Therefore, it is necessary to decline all requests. The General Assembly adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3>China Education Construction Society Devotes Itself to Rural Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>Overview of the Work of the Huangdu Chicken Farm in the Past Year</p>
<p>The China Education Construction Society has been devoted to production education enterprises in recent years and has achieved considerable results. In the spring of last year, the Society and the Jiangsu Provincial Huangdu Rural Normal School jointly established the Huangdu Chicken Farm, with the aim of improving our country's chicken breeds to increase the auxiliary production of rural areas. Since its establishment, it has been less than a year, and the results have been remarkable. The current situation of the farm is briefly described below for the reference of those engaged in rural production education.</p>
<p>Current Chicken Breeds: In February last year, the farm rented more than ten mu of farmland from the Huangdu Rural Normal School farm as a site, and then started construction of four new-style large and small chicken houses, purchased incubators and brooders, as well as other chicken-raising equipment. In March, it began to hatch and breed chicks, and the results were excellent. There are currently more than 200 white Leghorn hens, which began laying eggs in November last year.</p>
<p>Breeding Work: Currently, the farm is working hard on breeding. In October last year, 50 excellent hens were selected and began to be used in caged nests to record their yields from November 1. It has been four months since then, and it is reported that the average yield of each hen can exceed 80%, and the feathers are beautiful and the chicken bodies are strong, which are truly rare breeding males. In addition, the farm has also retained more than ten strong males, weighing about five catties or more, which are quite in line with the standards of breeding males. In January of this year, the pair mating method (MatinginPairs) was adopted for group mating, and it has been more than two months since then. More than 20 high-quality breeding eggs can be retained every day. In addition to self-sufficiency, there is a slight surplus, and there are many overseas letters ordering them, so the supply is often unable to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Actively Expanding: The farm has been established for a very short time, but it already has a considerable foundation. This year, it is still actively expanding, increasing the number of hens by 500 in preparation for promoting chicken breeds. Three new chicken houses are under construction and will be completed soon. The first hatching began on March 6, and chicks can be bred before the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>Recruiting Student Workers: The farm recently felt that there was a lack of chicken-raising technical talents in the country, so it specially recruited student workers so that they could learn chicken-raising knowledge and skills within a year to meet the needs of society. It is reported that student workers at the four farms, in addition to providing their own meals and paying a deposit of 100 yuan, do not charge other fees. One student has already been recruited, a graduate of Shanghai Middle School in Jiangsu Province, who entered the farm to study in early February.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Dispute at Anglo-American Workers' Children School</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Mediate, Factory Has Acknowledged</p>
<p>The Shanghai Private Anglo-American Workers' Children School previously had a dispute due to the factory's destruction of labor education. The Fifth District Tobacco Industry Trade Union, based on a resolution of the representative meeting, sent a letter to the Anglo-American Tobacco Company, setting a time limit for a concrete reply, otherwise all employees would strike. At the same time, the school board resolved to determine regular expenses of 1,150 yuan, additional class fees of 400 yuan, and book fees of 300 yuan. The factory representative firmly refused to acknowledge this. The trade union sent representatives Chen Peide and Lou Jingguan to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government Education Bureau, and the Social Bureau to petition separately. The details have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. Now it is learned that the dispute at the school has been resolved through the persuasion of party and government agencies, ordering the factory to accept all 900-plus students who have registered this year, increasing regular expenses to 1,050 yuan according to the original amount, adding two classrooms, with the factory providing school supplies and books worth 300 yuan, which the factory will pay as usual. The factory has also acknowledged this and sent a letter of apology to the trade union. The dispute has come to an end.</p>

<h3>Middle-Distance Running Star Wang Mingshen Arrives in Beiping from the Northeast</h3>
<p>Still Full of Spirit, Unwilling to Be a Second-Class Slave of a Fallen Nation</p>
<p>Will Continue to Practice in Preparation for Attending the Far East Games</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Wang Mingshen, a middle-distance running athlete who has been famous in the Chinese track and field world for several years, has not been heard from in the interior since the Northeast Incident. Yesterday, Wang suddenly arrived in Ping from Harbin by train and stayed at the Northeast Sports Association. The reporter made a special visit. According to Wang,</p>
<p>Motivation for Coming to Ping and What Happened: Since the Northeast Incident, I (Wang referred to himself) have been living in Harbin. Still full of spirit, I am unwilling to be a running dog of a puppet state. I have been trying to find a way to return to the interior. When Fu Baolu and Wu Jingyao were in Harbin, the three of us often encouraged each other. Later, Fu and Wu left Harbin, but I was unable to go with them for some reason. Now that there is an opportunity, I decided to break away from the life of a second-class slave of a fallen nation and resolutely came to Ping. After that, I will continue to study on the one hand and work hard to practice middle-distance running on the other, preparing to participate in the upcoming Far East Games pre-selection meeting.</p>
<p>Is Yu Xiwei Willing to Betray? Wang also said that the puppet state particularly advocates sports, and at the same time wants to divert the patriotic thoughts of young people, so it particularly woos athletes. When I was in Harbin, the puppet state sent several people to contact me, inviting me to participate in the sports meeting in the puppet capital, but I refused. Yu Xiwei is now working in the Ministry of Culture and Education of the puppet state and already has some kind of addiction. The future is hopeless (Note: Wang Mingshen is 26 years old, from Harbin, and was a student at Feng Yong University. His 800-meter result is 1 minute 58.8 seconds, his 400-meter result is 52.8 seconds, and his 1,500-meter is 4 minutes 16 seconds, which is rare in the country).</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Basketball Game Fudan Defeats Central</h3>
<p>Fudan Defeats Central 51 to 29</p>
<p>Jinan Defeats Chizhi 59 to 20</p>
<p>Two Games Today</p>
<p>The Central University basketball team, which defeated Jinan 29 to 27 in Nanjing, came to Shanghai a few days ago to play in the Jiangnan University Sports Association basketball game. This game seems to have a great relationship with this year's championship. Since Central can beat Jinan, it seems to have hope of winning the championship. Fudan has always been strong, and its call for winning the championship is the highest. This meeting was expected to be a fierce battle, but unexpectedly, compared with each other, Central was raw and unskilled, and the team was scattered, which was quite far from Fudan. The first half was 26 to 9, and Central made great efforts in the second half, resulting in a defeat of 29 to 51. In another game, Jinan defeated Chizhi, which was a one-sided situation, 59 to 20, Jinan won a big victory. There was no women's competition in either group. There will also be two games today. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Central vs. Daxia at Daxia on Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>Jinan vs. Guanghua at Guanghua on Daxilu</p>
<p>Fudan Defeats Central</p>
<p>Disparity in Situation Fudan basketball room was crowded with students from the school. The judge Zhou Jiaqi ordered mobilization. The visiting team Xu Biao took the first record. Fudan made great efforts. Zhou Dayun and Zhao Butian scored six points in a row. Under the control of Fudan, it was difficult for Central to move. Fudan's defense was tight and the transmission was skilled. The score suddenly changed to 18 to 3. Central tried its best to cheer up, but it was not worth the loss, 26 to 9, a disparity in the situation.</p>
<p>Central Rises Up After the first half, Fudan's Zhao Butian's technique was very smooth. Qiu Guangxie and Chen Zongqi also added three points, making it 37 to 9. This was the heyday of Fudan. Central suffered this setback and tried to cheer up. Sure enough, the situation changed and the momentum was great. The guards Wu Shouqi and Yu Jinxiang scored successively. Zhao Butian continued to return, making it 41 to 16. Central's Xu Biao, Zhou Heming, Zhong Jiqing, etc. repeatedly made contributions, and the score increased greatly. The situation suddenly became balanced, and later became 29 to 43. Fudan made a final struggle and staged a beautiful technique again, resulting in a result of 51 to 29. Fudan has average talents and excellent ball skills. Chen Zongqi's guard is really a leader among the newcomers. Zhao Butian's shooting is especially rare.</p>

<p>Jinan Defeats Chizhi</p>
<p>Jinan and Chizhi fought at the Chizhi outdoor court on Shuidaolu, and it was held in the rain. The referee was originally scheduled to be Chizhi instructor Shu Hong who hired Mr. Hu Zongfan the night before, but when Mr. Hu arrived at the court yesterday, Mr. Chen Fuzhang was already performing the referee duties. It is unknown how Shu Hong contacted him beforehand, causing Mr. Hu to return in vain. The situation of the two teams was disparate. Jinan scored 25 points in the first half, and Chizhi only scored 3 points. As a result, 59 to 20, Jinan won a big victory.</p>

Welch has 11 wins and 3 losses in 14 games, scoring 22 points. Comparing the two, although South China's position on the standings is better than Welch's, South China is actually behind Welch in terms of the number of games won and lost. Last Sunday, the two heroes met and competed for this year's championship. South China recruited all the elite to fight to the death, but unexpectedly lost 1 to</p>

<h3>Design of Power Transformers</h3>
<p>— Ming Sang</p>
<p>The first step in designing a power transformer for a radio is to calculate the power consumed by the radio, which is the product of the voltage and current required for each electrode of the vacuum tubes, with the unit being watts. The transformer itself loses a small portion of power due to resistance and magnetic leakage, so the input power is always greater than the output power. The percentage of input to output</p>
<p>ratio is the efficiency of the transformer.</p>
<p>After knowing the power, the second step is to choose a suitable iron core. Transformer iron cores are made of very thin silicon steel sheets stacked together to prevent eddy current losses. The magnetic field density is standardized at 50,000 to 60,000 lines of magnetic force per square inch. The size of the iron core is usually calculated by the cross-sectional area of the coil. The appropriate size can be found in the fourth row of Table 2.</p>
<p>Table 1</p>
<p>Current 1.7A 1.1 .68 .43 .27 .17 .11 .067 .042 .026 .017</p>
<p>Wire No. 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36</p>
<p>Table 2</p>
<p>Core Area (Square Inches) I I.14 I.25 I.36 I.50 I.70 I.78 I.90 2.2</p>
<p>Turns per Volt 6.4 5.5 4.8 4.4 4.1 3.75 3.33 3.1 2.84</p>
<p>Efficiency 70% 75% 75% 75% 80% 85% 90% 90% 90%</p>
<p>Input Power (Watts) 30 40 50 60 70 80 100 120 150</p>
<p>The third step is to calculate the current load of each coil</p>
<p>, and determine the appropriate thickness of the wire. Each ampere of current should have a cross-sectional area of I500 circular mils of wire to be safe. The copper wire number and the limit of the current that can be loaded are shown in Table 1. The best material for the wire is enamel-coated copper wire because it has excellent insulation, can withstand high voltage, and is economical and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of turns must be calculated. First, find the number of turns per volt in the third row of Table 2, and then multiply each primary and secondary coil by the required voltage. This is the correct number of turns. Here is another example to clarify the design steps.</p>
<p>The transformer shown in the figure is prepared for a four-tube radio. The secondary coil has three coils: A is used to heat the filaments of two 224 and one 247 vacuum tubes, B is used to heat the filament of the 280 rectifier tube, and C is the high-voltage coil to connect the two plate electrodes of the rectifier tube. According to the vacuum tube characteristics table, the voltage of A should be 2.5V, the current is 31.75 = 5.25Amp, and the power is 2.5V5.25A = 13.12W. B should be 5V2A = 10W. Only the voltage from one end to the center tap needs to be calculated, which is 350V. Assuming the current is 0.05A, then the power is 350.05 = 17.5W. The total power of the transformer is about 40W. In the second row of Table 2, the efficiency is found to be 75% =, so the input power should be 55W. If the primary is 220V, then the current is .25A. The size of the iron core can be found in the last row of Table 2, and the area should be 1.30 square inches. The wire number can be found in Table 1 according to the current required for each coil. The primary should use No. 24 wire, A can use three No. 16 wires wound in parallel, B can use No. 16 wire, and C can use No. 31 wire. Then, from the third row of Table 2, the number of turns per volt is found to be 4.6, so the number of secondary turns should be A2.54.6 = 11.5B = 54.6 = 23C7004.65220. A center tap is connected at 2610 turns, and the number of primary turns is also calculated by the same method 2204.6 = 1012</p>
<h3>Transformerless Power Supply</h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>In the power supply section of an AC radio, the transformer is the most expensive and troublesome component, and the transformer itself is bulky, occupies space, and prevents DC current from passing through. Therefore, designers of AC/DC dual-purpose machines always think of ways to eliminate it. In recent years, with the popularity of small radios, the demand to abandon transformers has become even more urgent.</p>
<p>Removing the transformer is less of a problem in the B voltage aspect, and can be directly supplied with 110V commercial power; as for the low-voltage filament aspect, if relying entirely on resistance reduction, the loss is inevitable. Therefore, new vacuum tubes such as 丨43, 25Z5 with 25V filaments have emerged.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>The transformerless power supply device for these new vacuum tubes can be understood by looking at Figure 1. One end of the AC input is connected to the plate electrode of the rectifier tube, and also connected to the filament electrode of the vacuum tube connected in series. The other end is connected to the filament circuit. The current after rectification is output from the cathode.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, the filament electrodes of the three tubes are connected in series, and a resistor R is used to help reduce the voltage. The value of R can be calculated by the following formula.</p>
<p>Resistance in ohms = Voltage supplied 丨 Sum of voltages of each vacuum tube / Current required for vacuum tube filament</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>For example, in Figure 1, the -77 filament electrode is 6.3V, and both .43 and 25Z5 are 25V, totaling 56.3V. Now, if a voltage of 110V is supplied, subtracting 56.3V leaves 53.7V. The filament current of the above three tubes is all 0.3 amps. Dividing 53.7 by 0.3 gives 179 ohms, which is the value required for the filament. In this device, we must pay attention to making the current passing through each tube equal. As shown in Figure 2, -57 and -57 are both 1.0 amps, while -43 and 25Z5 are only 0.3 amps, with a difference of 0.7 amps, so a resistor R1 must be connected in parallel to make up this 0.7 amps. The value of 0R1 can be obtained by Ohm's law: Required voltage / Voltage to be passed. The filament voltage of -43 and 25Z5 is 50V in total. Dividing 50 by 0.7 equals 71 ohms, which is the value of R1.</p>
<p>For radios using transformerless power supply devices, the grounding point must be strictly isolated with a capacitor, and the connection point of the antenna is best isolated with a capacitor to prevent accidents if the antenna touches the ground.</p>
<h3>Filter Circuit for Rectified Power Supply</h3>
<p>— Chong Ling</p>
<p>In order to be suitable for AC power, AC radios must have the following three components: (1) transformer, (2) rectifier, and (3) filter. Low-voltage 110 or 220 volt AC power is stepped up to an appropriate high voltage by a transformer, output through a rectifier tube, and converted into pulsating voltage. Therefore, the output current is a pulsating current, and its pulsating frequency is the low frequency of the power supply (50 or 60 cycles per second). If this low frequency or its multiple frequency current is picked up by a low-frequency transformer or directly by a speaker, the AC hum will be noisy. The filter circuit of the rectified power supply is to eliminate the AC hum in the speaker. Therefore, every AC radio must have a filter for the rectified power supply. The pulsating current after rectification is input into this filter circuit, and after the smoothing action of this filter, the output voltage is DC voltage, and the AC voltage component is very small, often only one thousandth of the DC voltage.</p>
<p>The filter circuit is nothing more than a choke coil and a fixed capacitor. The choke coil is naturally a low-frequency iron core choke coil, with a value of 10 to 50 Henrys being suitable. Its function is to smooth the pulsating current. In other words, it prevents the pulsation of the current, because the choke coil has inductance. When the current increases, it will generate a back voltage due to induction to prevent its increase, and when it decreases, it will also cause positive electricity</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>pressure to prevent its decrease. The capacitor used should also have a large capacitance of 2 to 8 microfarads (mtd). The function of the capacitor is to prevent the pulsation of the voltage and maintain the constant pressure of the output; when the voltage increases, the capacitor is charged, and when the voltage decreases, the capacitor discharges to the end to increase</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>its voltage, so the pulsating voltage can be converted into a constant pressure output.</p>
<h3>Figure 3</h3>
<p>&lt;]</p>
<p>There are many types of filter circuits, which vary depending on the arrangement of the choke coil and capacitor. Usually, the types shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 are commonly used, especially Figure 3 is the best. Figure 2 adds a capacitor to the filter circuit of Figure 1 to smooth the remaining pulsating voltage of the Figure 1 circuit; Figure 3 is a combination of Figure 1 and Figure 2, and most of the better radios use this type. L can use 30 or 50 Henrys, L1 can use 10 or 15 Henrys, and L1L2 can use 30 Henrys low-frequency choke coils; if the output voltage is not high, C, C1, C2, and C3 can use 8 microfarads, otherwise use 2 or 4 microfarads. The current diagram on each figure shows the situation of the pulsating current input being converted into DC output through the filter circuit.</p>
<h3>Special Rectifier Device</h3>
<p>— Wei Xin Su</p>
<p>The rectifiers used in AC radios can be generally divided into three types: electrolytic rectifier, dry metal disc rectifier, and vacuum tube rectifier. The first type is too cumbersome and inconvenient to use, so very few people use it. The second type is not yet available in Shanghai radio material stores. The third type requires vacuum tubes and transformers, which is quite expensive, and it is not cost-effective to use it to supply a single-tube machine.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three types of rectifiers, we now have a special rectifier. We have long known that electrolytic capacitors have the characteristic of only allowing current to flow in one direction. If an electrolytic capacitor is used in an AC circuit, it cannot condense chemical gas to form a thin film on the anode surface to block the passage of current. By using these two characteristics, an electrolytic capacitor can be used as a rectifier as shown in the figure. C in the figure is a double-connected dry electrolytic capacitor, with 4 MFOCH on each side. H are two 20 Henry choke coils. R2 is a 0-25000 ohm variable resistor. T is a 2.5V small square shed, L is an ordinary three-turn coil, C1 is a 0.0005MF variable capacitor. C2 is a 0.00025MF capacitor, R1 is a 2MEG grid leak resistor. Vacuum tubes such as 157 or -24 can be used.</p>
<h3>Analysis of AC Radio Power Supply (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Meng Ji</p>
<p>(4) Potentiometer After obtaining a fixed value of voltage, it can be directly applied. However, since the plate and grid of each vacuum tube in the radio require different voltages, potentiometers are also indispensable. A potentiometer is a quantitative resistor. Its two ends are directly connected to the positive and negative poles, and there are also many connections in the middle to supply different voltages. Therefore, the voltage on the detector tube, amplifier tube, and power amplifier tube can be freely selected. The negative voltage on the grid is also mostly taken from the same potentiometer, because positive and negative are originally relative terms. Assuming that the voltage at a certain point on the potentiometer is taken as zero value, then the voltage that is higher than that point is taken as positive, and the voltage that is lower than that point is negative.</p>
<p>Now, the functions and order of the four parts are shown in a diagram. Readers can refer to the diagram to understand the relationship between each part more clearly. The upper part of the diagram shows the order of connection of each part, the lower part shows the function of each part, AB is the reference line, which also indicates the zero potential. Each section of the curve is explained in the diagram below. The shape of the pulsating voltage shown below the rectifier indicates that a full-wave rectifier is used, which makes the two half-cycles of the AC voltage effective. If it is a half-wave rectifier, then only half of the AC cycle is effective, and the other half is cut off and loses its effectiveness. AB is also a reference line, and the waveform curve on the line indicates the shape of the AC filament voltage coming out of the transformer.</p>
<h3>Rectifier Circuit</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>The B voltage in our radio must always use DC. In an AC machine, although the power source is taken from AC, its B voltage is still DC converted from AC, because if we add AC, which changes between positive and negative dozens of times per second, to the plate of the vacuum tube in the radio, there must be a huge AC hum, which completely covers up the sound we want to listen to. Therefore, rectification is very important in AC machines.</p>
<p>After AC passes through rectification, it becomes pulsating DC. If it is used for charging, then it can be charged into a battery, but if it is used as a substitute for B voltage, it must still pass through a filtering device to convert the pulsating DC into pure</p>
<p>Pure DC, and then apply it to the radio, because if this pulsating DC is used to the vacuum tube of the radio, there is still a huge buzzing sound, and</p>
<p>Covering up the required sound, the so-called filtering device is composed of a low-frequency choke coil and a large number of capacitors. This magazine has another article "Filtering Circuit" to explain it in detail, which is omitted here. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>In the article "Various Rectifier Tubes" published in the 55th issue of this magazine, it was found that the 5Z3 vacuum tube is not a mercury vapor rectifier tube, and its properties are similar to those of the No. 80 vacuum tube. We hereby make a correction. The characteristics (according to the R·C·A company's book) are recorded below:</p>
<p>Characteristic</p>
<p>Filament Voltage Five Volts</p>
<p>Filament Current Three Amperes</p>
<p>Plate Voltage Five Hundred Volts</p>
<p>Maximum Plate Direct Two Hundred and Fifty</p>

<h3>All Vehicles Keep to the Left</h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>On the roads of Shanghai, we can see the words "All vehicles keep to the left." It is the same in foreign countries. Next to the roads in London, it is written "Keep the left."</p>
<p>Even the ignorant rickshaw pullers will not pull the rickshaw on the right side of the road, because they know what the consequences will be. They will always remember "All vehicles keep to the left."</p>
<p>If a vehicle does not follow this rule and travels on the right side of the road, a very unfortunate result will immediately occur, completely disrupting the traffic on a road and even the entire city.</p>
<p>Therefore, vehicles must keep to the left to avoid unfortunate events. People know the rules for driving and walking and can abide by them; however, they are completely wrong about things other than the prescribed driving and walking.</p>
<p>They often crash their cars together, causing bloodshed; they would rather not move than yield to the left.</p>
<p>Therefore, British Professor Keynes scolded: "...The world's depression is entirely caused by the world's stubborn and inferior nature. It is like two drivers colliding on the avenue, insisting on not giving way to each other..."</p>
<p>In fact, all the unrest in the world is caused by the stubborn and inferior nature of people in the world, and it is not limited to depression. When this inferior nature is manifested in politics, its impact is self-evident.</p>
<p>If this inferior nature is not removed, China will hardly have a unified destiny.</p>
<h3>A Smart Child?</h3>
<p>— Fei Pengruo</p>
<p>It is a mother's nature to like her child to be smart. When she expresses her affection to others by saying how smart her child is; this can be said to be the most "true" emotional expression between people in the world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Someone has five children, three boys and two girls. The oldest girl is only six years old. Mrs. Someone likes this child the most because she is the smartest. The reason why this child is smart is that it fits Mrs. Someone's temperament, and only Mrs. Someone can recognize this "smart" as smart. Others may deny it.</p>
<p>The child's name is "Tao Xi." People are a little suspicious of this name. But in Mrs. Someone's own heart, she is very confident that this name is the most meaningful, and it often reminds her of her past pride. She once said to others: "A few days before the child was about to be born, it was a great day. The second landlord's wife 'Teacher Li' hosted a 'betrothal' for her son. Mrs. Someone was invited there to drink. After the banquet, the ladies present gathered together to play a game of 'Mahjong' with a ten-dollar bottom. At the end of nine rounds, Mrs. Someone won three bottoms plus another. This was an unprecedented stroke of luck for Mrs. Someone since she started gambling, and she had never been so happy. Moreover, she had smooth sailing from then on. The first, second, third... few days were also consecutive victories. Unexpectedly, one day she suddenly had a stomach ache and gave birth to that girl who was less than nine months old. Mrs. Someone often has a saying: 'Winning money is destined.' She believes that she does not have the fate of 'unexpected wealth,' and from this she knows that this time's winning money is the source of the child's birth, so she named her 'Tao Xi.' Because this is how she is pleasing!"</p>
<p>Although Tao Xi is six years old, she still can't speak properly, and can only count from one to three. But she has long recognized the characters of East, South, West, North, Center, Fa, One, Two, Three... Nine on the "Mahjong tiles." And strangely, when she sees the tiles, she changes. She is usually irritable and naughty, but when she goes with her mother to play Mahjong at the neighbor's house, she will sit at the corner of the table and stare blankly.</p>
<p>And she can help her mother take care of "missed tiles." If there are pairs in her mother's tiles, and someone plays out the same tile, she will shout "Pong" with her mother. Other than that, she is silent, her hands are drooping, her eyes are staring, just watching attentively. If sometimes her mother is missing three to complete a set, or three are missing one to complete a set, she will pay attention and call "Teacher Wang," "Mother Li" over, so her mother loves her the most, and even "Teacher Wang," "Mother Li" praises her as a "good child"!</p>
<p>When Mrs. Someone heard the words good child, she naturally added another layer of joy. She praised her daughter even more to others, and brought out the "Mahjong tiles" to test her in person. Then, most irrelevant people praised her again as a "smart child"!</p>
<h3>The Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 26: Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror, I Grieve for My Beloved; Righteously Baring My Chest, I Forget My Family to Serve the Nation</p>
<p>Wangfujing Avenue, such a wide road, they were walking haphazardly, filling</p>
<p>an entire street. People on the street were all dodging and hiding. The more these short devils saw the Chinese like this, the more they swaggered with their arms and splayed legs, bumping into people on the street. The pitiful patrol police, always afraid of causing trouble on their turf, only dispersed the idle people on both sides of the street. Small stall owners and those carrying burdens ran everywhere. Because I was wearing gray clothes, they didn't dare shoo me away, only gave me a couple of glances. I also knew clearly that causing trouble would only make things difficult for the local authorities, so I had to step aside. But I clenched my fists, really wishing I could go up and beat two of them to death. After they had walked far away, I said, "Hmph! We'll meet on the front lines!" Company Commander, you didn't see the situation then, it really could make you spit out two mouthfuls of hot blood. That's why the words I said were only uttered after my lungs were bursting with anger. Guess what? Someone behind me sneered and said, "Just you?" When I turned around to look, the person had run away. The "you" he was referring to, I think, meant two things. First, he was saying that us soldiers didn't have the ability. Second, he heard my Northeastern accent and was saying that Northeasterners didn't have that kind of talent. But no matter which aspect he was talking about, I couldn't bear that kind of humiliation. Even now, when I think about it, I feel fire on the tips of my hair. If they ever organize a suicide squad on the front lines, count me, Wang, as one. As he spoke, he repeatedly patted his chest a few times. Zhao Ziqiang didn't say anything after hearing this, jumped into the pit, and tore off the red auspicious couplets pasted on the wall. Finally, even the little bits of red paper scraps that were left, he tore off as well. Wang Shili was a little bewildered by his sudden actions. Zhao Ziqiang tore the red paper completely clean before jumping down from the pit and smiling at Wang Shili: "You probably don't understand why I did this, right? I'll tell you, when I see this red paper, I think of happy events, and when I think of happy events, I naturally think of home. Always thinking like this can shatter a belly full of ambition, so I tore it off." (344)</p>
<h3>Research on Inkstones (8)</h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke (Bored Guest)</p>
<p>General Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>Beautiful Patterns: Duan stone is considered to have beautiful patterns such as azure flowers, fish brain jelly, banana leaf white, sky blue, ice patterns, various fire marks, starling eyes, etc. Among the beautiful patterns, the azure flower is the most important. The names are very complex, and the forms are infinitely varied. The arguments about inkstones among the Japanese are only about azure flowers, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>A. Azure Flowers: "Stone Hidden Inkstone Talks" says that Song people generally didn't talk about azure flowers when discussing inkstones. Only "Ancient Inkstone Identification" began to use the phrase "drops are azure flowers" from Wu Shu's "Inkstone Ode" of the Tang Dynasty to prove the azure flower stone from the ancient pit. However, it only said that there were flower spots as big as chopsticks heads, like fine, clear jade.</p>
<p>It also says: "In the blackish-blue, there are white spots like millet, arranged like stars, a strange phenomenon, which does not match the modern discussion of azure flower iron. This is because the lower rock that was being mined at that time had not yet been dug to the depths." Later, as mining gradually</p>
<p>progressed, the essence was fully revealed, and the various forms of azure flowers were also recognized by many people. But everyone knows that azure flowers are precious, but no one has ever revealed why they are so precious. Even inkstone-loving writers only say: "Azure flowers are the essence of the stone;" "Only the finest stone has azure flowers." However, the reason for this extremely fine essence, they</p>
<p>cannot explain. The Japanese, on the other hand, have used scientific methods to study the reason for the special fineness of azure flowers from the essence of Duan stone. The book "Chinese Ancient Inkstones and Literature" by Bando Kanzan (translated by my colleague Hu Yizang) mentioned earlier has the following passage on azure flowers:</p>
<p>"What is the essence of azure flowers? In short, Duan stone belongs to</p>
<p>tuffaceous sedimentary rock. Its constituent molecules contain micro-molecules of diabase. These micro-molecules are scattered like fine dust, or aggregate to form coarse spots. Especially when these micro-molecules are distributed in stone with a hardness that is balanced with the inkstone surface, it is a supreme masterpiece (i.e., micro-dust azure flowers). However, it is very difficult to obtain such fine products, because the crystal shape of the stone is mostly uneven. The reason why Duan stone has fewer of these is due to the power of these diabase micro-molecules. Ink produced on inkstones with these micro-molecules has a luster that is completely different from the ordinary."</p>
<p>And in its discussion of stone eyes, it says:</p>
<p>"The substance of stone eyes is stone-linked worms, and its main body is mixed with diabase. The stone-linked worms are shaped like maggots or earthworms. The body of this worm is calcareous. The calcareous substance is washed away, and diabase seeps into it, solidifying it. The Duan people say that stone with azure veins must have eyes, which is the manifestation of diabase."</p>
<p>The Japanese are accustomed to studying mineralogy, so they have this discovery. In the past, China did not have this scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>We only know that azure means azure flowers, but in fact, it is not entirely azure. The dense micro-dust azure flowers are almost black, while the light ant-foot azure flowers are almost light white, light green, or pale red, and pale yellow. Therefore, when discussing azure flowers, one must not be stuck to one shape or one color, but understand them spiritually to know their wonder. "Stone Flower's" discussion of azure flowers says, "Azure flowers should be fine, not coarse; lively, not dull; deep, not exposed; blurred, not clustered; and whole, not broken." Micro-dust is the most precious, followed by goose down, then ant feet (also known as fly feet), then goose down clusters (i.e., azure flower clusters), then rose purple, and then fly heads (i.e., parent-child azure flowers). Other forms that are patchy, lined up, coarse, and dry are not worth valuing. And "Stone Hidden's" discussion also includes names such as fly wings, duckweed, fish schools, and taro patterns. There is also the so-called winter melon pulp, which Gao Guqi considered a masterpiece. In addition, there are rain-soaked wall azure flowers and clam belly pattern azure flowers mentioned in previous writings. However, the Japanese consider rain-soaked wall azure flowers to be as precious as micro-dust, saying that late Qing literati admired this product. If they encountered this stone, they would hide it under a stone slab, unwilling to carve it. Winter melon pulp, on the other hand, is only regarded as a medium product, like taro patterns shaped like stone flower vegetables. Furthermore, Mr. Bando said that when "Stone Flower" wrote the history of inkstones, he only</p>
<p>listed rose purple azure flowers as second-class. Later, in his reply to his friend Wang Hezhou, he called rose purple a famous material unique to Water Return Cave, which should be listed above all azure flowers. From this, it can be seen that the preferences for inkstones, and the criticism of good or bad, also differ even within a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Proposals for Financial Silver Abound</h3>
<p>Benchmark Gold Price Falls by Six Dollars and One Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a decline due to the reaction to silver prices and the sudden surge in proposals for silver in the United States through foreign news. The morning started with overseas silver markets, with British prices shrinking and American prices flat. Forward silver prices on the London Metal Exchange rose by five to ten tenths of a penny. Exchange rates were extremely flat. London gold rose by two pence. Private telegraph silver prices and exchange rates remained unchanged. American cotton fell by eight pounds, and American wheat was unmoved. The wool market opened with an immediate decline. The Associated Press reported that American silver faction Congressman Scoggins proposed buying 90 million ounces of silver per month to purchase a total of 100 million ounces and to achieve a gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1. Another Congressman, Goldsborough, proposed establishing a joint monetary committee consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, members of the Federal Reserve Board, and representatives appointed by the President to monitor the fineness of gold. If prices fall by 5% or do not rise for a year, the fineness of the US dollar may be revised. Market sentiment weakened, and the opening market was relatively flat, as it was known that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing remained unchanged. Later, due to the hardening of the domestic market, Reuters reported that the US House Banking Subcommittee passed a bill that included permission for federal monetary authorities to buy and sell silver, but the ratio must be 371.25 grains of silver to 23.22 grains of pure gold (i.e., 16 to 1). The message that this case would be voted on next Monday caused a gradual decline, but it mostly hovered. Although Seattle's night market silver futures shrank later, banks strongly filled orders, the domestic market continued to harden, and market sentiment also weakened. The market situation initially concealed and then collapsed. The March futures also fell due to the hardening of the shilling, with the swap spread at two yuan. The gold price was calculated at 979 yuan. The Central Bank opened few spot transactions, priced at 965 yuan and a half. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>

Later, Zhengjin closed at seven-month American gold seventy-five, and Qian Changxiang, Yuanmao, Hongli, Zhifengyong, and others all entered, gradually rising to six yuan and seven cents, anticipating that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British and American listings would not move. Subsequently, Anda came out with seven-month American gold seventy-five, and Yidayong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengtai, Jiatai, Qian Changxiang, Fuyu, Dadecheng, Tianfeng, Hengxing, and others all sold off.

Hengyu and Goods slightly stabilized with entry of orders. After being forced, Sanbing filled seven-month American gold eight seventy-five, and Hengxing, Qian Changxiang, Zhengchang, Hongli, and Zhifengyong sold again. Unfavorable news caused it to rise to two yuan and seven cents. Dadecheng and Yuqingyong entered orders, and seven-month American gold eight seventy-five was difficult to close, rising to outside of four yuan.

Fuan and Yuqingyong sold off, and the noon close was 964 yuan and four cents, with goods trading at four yuan and two cents. After the close, Yuqingyong still had supply, and it retreated to inside of four yuan.</p>

However, due to banks tending to fill orders, Shanghai filled six-month American gold eight seventy-five and seven-month nine thirty-seven five. Yuqingyong, Hengxing, and Yidayong sold off one after another, falling to two yuan and three cents.

<h3>The Situation of Foreign Short-Term Loans Seems to be Turning Slightly</h3>
<p>Opening at Four Minutes</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign short-term loan market price seemed to be slightly better than the previous day. Yesterday's rise stemmed from natural forces and was not comparable to the forced rises of the past few days. Therefore, the situation seemed to be turning. The prices in the morning and noon markets were both four minutes, an increase of two minutes compared to the previous day. Initial forward exchange rates were two or three minutes, but later seemed to be traded at par. The total short-term loan market transactions were 4.78 million in the morning and 560,000 in new transactions and noon transactions. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 500,000. Many banknote withdrawals were marked, totaling over 1.2 million. 1.1 million were issued. New foreign pledge loan transactions made up over 900,000, and the redemption amount was over 700,000. Customer road shipments totaled 250,000, while the source was only 300,000. Banks received and cleared foreign banks' receipt and clearing of bills totaling 2.78 million, various goods exchange pledge payments totaling 4.45 million, and warehouse withdrawals of 800,000. Chinese banks received and cleared bills totaling 2.78 million, various goods exchange tax and miscellaneous payments totaling over 3.7 million, and warehouse withdrawals of 300,000. Japanese banks received and cleared bills totaling 2.1 million, various goods exchange miscellaneous payments totaling 3.56 million, and warehouse entries of 200,000. Money shops' foreign public bills receipt and clearing totaled over 42 million, foreign forward exchange payments receipt and clearing totaled over 7.7 million, various road remittances totaled over 400,000, and cash receipts were slightly less than 1 million. In addition, the total exchange volume of the Shanghai Bills Clearing House on the 23rd was 6,100,9917 yuan, two jiao and three fen, including silver dollars of 2,879,103 yuan, nine jiao and five fen, and exchange silver dollars of 3,230,813 yuan, two jiao and eight fen.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Currency Recovers, Guangdong Currency Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small foreign currency was 822 yuan in the morning market, and recovered another three yuan in the noon market, to 825 yuan. The transaction volume was 9,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign currency was 757 yuan in the morning market, and declined slightly by seven jiao in the noon market, to 756 yuan and three jiao. The transaction volume was 75,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins remained at 322,000 wen, with a transaction volume of 28,656 strings, equivalent to 8,900 foreign yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Slightly Suppressed, Then Rise</h3>
<p>The First Session Once Fell</p>
<p>The Second Session's Rising Trend Resumes</p>
<p>The 22 Customs Rose by More Than One Yuan, the Most Significant</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, the short retracement that occurred at the opening session, although in line with predictions, was very temporary. The rising trend resumed and was even more intense than before. Slightly suppressed, they then rose, their flames were flourishing. Although short selling was significant, long-term covering and new longs were also quite active. The high morale of the market was unprecedented. When market prices were slightly pressured, their reaction was particularly strong. When short sellers briefly reduced pressure, their reaction created a new high price. The rise in market prices was actually gradually pushed forward by shorts. Observing the environment, high public bonds and low prices formed an inverse proportion. The more difficult it was for commodities to circulate, the more restricted the use of cash became. Therefore, the abnormal development of public bonds was still in its early stages. Even if there were retracements, they would be limited. However, one should not forget the danger in heights, and it is also necessary to be cautious. Currently, the Salt Tax market price has reached above 65%, and the squeeze is particularly severe due to the approaching delivery. After this, it may stabilize slightly, but it is feared that there may not be a significant drop. The events of yesterday showed that the opening situation was quite unstable. It started flat, and after entering, No. 38 was sold frantically, causing a decline, retracing by half a yuan. However, the shorts took the opportunity to cover, and the rebound in the second session was even more intense. Salt Tax rose by six or seven jiao, and 22 Customs spot goods were not yet on the market. The shorts' panic was especially self-inflicted. The squeeze was particularly severe, and the price soared by 1.34 yuan in one session. The pain of floating shorts was such. In the afternoon's two sessions, the rising momentum did not subside, and the closing was slightly weaker compared to the morning. However, the rising trend of Salt Tax was still strong, and 96 suddenly rose by eight or nine jiao, showing the longs' strong intentions. There were many old examples of this kind of behavior. It was nothing more than that the market prices of the various bonds had become high, and many had become boring, so the targets were changed. There was no reason for it. As a result, the market price rose again by 1.3 jiao to more than one yuan. The total transaction volume was 21,154,200 yuan, with futures totaling 21,154,000 yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are compared and listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Progress</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm based on the Wall Street Journal, the New York Stock Exchange market was still sluggish yesterday. However, due to the exceptionally good business report of U.S. Steel, silver speculators continued their activities, and there were unconfirmed rumors of a gold price increase, the market showed slight progress. Large speculators and the public mostly remained on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome of labor disputes and the development of the exchange management case. The small exchange market advanced with gold mining stocks. There was considerable selling of U.S. government bonds, influenced by the gold price rumors, and at the same time, bondholders were deeply worried that the silver bill would become law, causing considerable anxiety. Speculative bonds recovered to high levels, while foreign bonds were soft. Furthermore, according to agent reports, there was good demand for (securities) because the strike is about to be postponed, and the exchange management case shows signs of further modification. (Wheat) Business showed slight progress; the southwest and northwest are becoming increasingly arid, and news from Washington is more favorable than before—do not short sell. (Cotton) The market entered a standstill, awaiting developments from all sides. There was foreign selling, and factories bought when prices fell. Labor unrest is expanding, and some say that southern yarn factories will also strike, while opinions are increasingly divided between those who favor cooperation and those who favor compulsory reduction of cotton fields. The yarn and cloth market is sluggish, but buyers' needs are gradually increasing. Recently, due to many parties divesting, the market position has already improved, but a surge in market prices still awaits changes in the current situation. Total daily trading volume was 1,020,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 99.35 100.54 Up 1.21</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 46.94 47.69 Up 0.75</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 25.71 26.26 Up 0.55</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 92.58 92.49 Down 0.09</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities 53.29 53.54 Up 0.25</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Futures Yarn Are All in a Slump</h3>
<p>丨Bulls Heavily Trapped丨</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with the situation remaining weak and showing no signs of recovery. Given the unfavorable surrounding environment, sluggishness is necessary. As the delivery period approaches, goods entering warehouses are very enthusiastic, thus increasing the pressure on the yarn market. Combined with foreign merchants causing trouble from behind, it is difficult for factory solidarity to be consistent, making it even harder to consolidate the market. However, the bottom has dried up, and factories are losing money, so there will not be an excessive drop.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn First Rises Then Falls The opening price of standard yarn in the morning market, after a big fall, triggered profit-takers to cover their positions. The market atmosphere slightly stabilized, and each month rose by 1.2.4 jiao. In the afternoon, news came that spot yarn sales were quiet, and each month fell by 1.2.4.6 jiao to 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Total daily trading volume was 40,100 bales. It was found that Da Feng sold 2,400 bales, Ji Feng 700 bales, Sui Long 900 bales, Ming De 1,200 bales, Ming Hua 1,450 bales, Hui Kang 2,800 bales, Chang Yu 1,700 bales, Chang Feng 3,450 bales, and Xin Cheng 900 bales. Yuan Da bought 1,000 bales, Da Ji 700 bales, Geng Feng 1,650 bales, Yuan Da 1,400 bales, Tong He 1,600 bales, Fu Da 850 bales, and Sen Kang 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase Decrease Account Balance</p>
<p>March 176.0 175.5 175.6 Down 0.5 29,450</p>

<h3>The Falling Trend of Cotton Has Subsided</h3>
<p>After a sharp drop in cotton prices, the market has stabilized slightly. However, overseas cotton markets are weak, Indian cotton prices are falling, and the falling trend is intensifying due to increasing inventory. Therefore, people's hearts are anxious, factories are hesitant, and the market still appears to be softening.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Rises by One Jiao Before and After The opening price of standard cotton in the morning market fell due to a sharp drop in Indian cotton prices and poor sentiment, but then rebounded due to short covering, resulting in an increase of 5 fen. In the afternoon, each month rose again by 5 fen. Total daily trading volume was 90,200 dan. It was found that Da Feng sold 5,700 dan, Chun Ji 2,500 dan, Chang Yu 1,700 dan, Chang Feng 7,500 dan, Hui Kang 2,000 dan, Xin Heng 2,100 dan, and Chang He 1,800 dan.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market initially fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, then rebounded strongly due to Wall Street's strength. Later, it weakened again due to foreign selling. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures fell by 1 to 8 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 11 points, and futures fell by 8 points. Egyptian spot cotton fell by 12 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to bull liquidation and speculator selling. As a result, Pingar fell by 3 rupees and 7.5 annas, Omra fell by 4 rupees and 4.5 annas, and White Ruxi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram records are as follows (dated 22nd):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent to National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent to National Currency</p>

<h3>Excessive Long Positions Cause Flour Prices to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a downward trend across near and far months after the opening in the morning. Due to the continuous rise in market prices in recent days, prices were up by 7-8 fen to nearly a jiao compared to the low prices at the beginning of the month. However, this did not lead to any real offtake, but rather created an opportunity for general hoarding and buying. Therefore, after the opening price in the morning, various hoarding and hedging long positions took the opportunity to sell off. Although factories did not sell off, they also lacked purchases. However, speculators still had strong interest, and in addition to the return of long positions, there was also short covering. Total daily trading volume was 320,000 bags, which was still considered lively in the recent sluggish trading period. However, with more selling than buying, buying interest became even more sluggish in the afternoon. Therefore, forward contracts saw more short selling. The closing price was down 2 fen for this month, down 2.75 fen for next month, down 2.5 fen for May, down 1.5 fen for June and July, and down 1.75 fen for August.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Futures Weak, Spot Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw very little activity in imported wheat. After the opening price of standard wheat, there were long positions selling off in the near term, and the declining flour market caused sentiment to trend downward. March and April saw a consistent decline, while there were still new buyers inquiring about the forward contracts. The final closing price was down 5 fen for March, down 4 fen for April, up 1 fen for July, and up 2 fen for August. Spot wheat saw active arrivals and sales, and the market was also slightly firm. Shandong wheat was priced at 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen, Yaowan at 3 yuan and 6 jiao, Bengbu at 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen, Linhua at 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 4 fen, and Mingguang Yingzhou at 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen, totaling 3,000 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Sutong and Nan Gang Rice Fell Another 5 Fen</h3>
<p>North Market Common Japonica Rice Not Available Due to Disputes</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources, totaling over 6,000 shi, with late rice accounting for the majority and thick japonica rice accounting for a small portion. Sales were slow, and the market did not look promising at the beginning. Few customers came to the street, with only a slight movement from customers from other provinces. Sellers found it difficult to manage this situation, and if they wanted to tighten prices, they worried about leftover goods, so they had to call for flat prices. The northern and southern ocean firms then began to purchase goods. Firms from Xiamen and other places paid attention to Fengjing, Xilian, Nangang, and Zhongguan late rice. Weihaiwei and Tianjin firms favored Qingjiao and Songjiang high-quality goods, totaling more than 2,000 bags. Regarding the distribution problem, it was heard that both the customer firms and their landlords were restricted by the price limits in the telegrams, so the market depreciated by 4-5 fen. The thick japonica rice in the stores of the various firms was sluggish, and the market outlook was weak, so the market color was not bleak. The prices of Sutong and Nangang goods fell by 5 fen. Only the common japonica rice in the common firm stood firm at the original price due to a shortage of goods. The delivery of Du Yangjian Lai was integrated into sales, without any change in price. Although the route for Yin Bian Yuan was not broad, the market color tightened again due to the scarcity of goods, but there was not much difference in price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from He Xia. The offtake of various goods in the market was still slow. The market shape of white japonica rice, thin rice, customer indica rice, Yin Yuan, and White Yuan was flat and weak. The firm stopped trading due to disputes.</p>
<h3>Additional Ten Batches of South-North Goods and Orchid Seeds Arrive</h3>
<p>丨New Mutton from Shikou Arrives in Three Boxes Yesterday丨</p>
<p>After the previous batch of orchid seeds arrived and opened at 48 yuan, the market was very strong due to early depletion of inventory. Yesterday, it was heard that Taikoo Company's Linan ship arrived with a batch, with only 20 remaining. Samples were immediately shown, and buyers rushed to purchase due to the good color and eggs, making it difficult to bargain.</p>
<p>New Shikou mutton had been in short supply for a long time, and recent sales had been active. Yesterday, the Linan ship arrived with three boxes. The samples showed a bright color and large size, making them top-notch. They were immediately sold for 97 yuan. If not much more arrives, the market looks stable.</p>
<h3>The Listed Prices of Both British and American Tinplate Have Increased</h3>
<p>The listed prices of both British and American tinplate were reported to have increased yesterday. British and American 90-pound boxes were sold for 16 shillings and 2 pence per box, up 2 pence from before, and 100-pound boxes were sold for 17 shillings and 2 pence, also up 3 pence. American 90-pound boxes were sold for 4 gold yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen, and 200-pound boxes were sold for 5 yuan and 9 jiao, up 2 jiao. Due to oversupply in the Shanghai market, industry peers adopted a hands-off approach to order business, so no purchases were heard.</p>
<p>Spot Hunan pure antimony, which is trending higher due to scarcity, was reportedly shipped from Hankou yesterday in more than ten tons, so the market outlook is expected to be lively again.</p>

<h3>After Reading "Literature's" "Translation Special Issue"</h3>
<p>— Yu Yangling</p>
<p>An ancient person said, "Other people's wives are better, one's own articles are better." Looking at the state of the reading world in recent years, we can say this: "Foreign writers are better, but domestic articles are better."</p>
<p>Gorky, Shaw, Romain Rolland, Barbusse, Gide, Sinclair... these names, and the deeds related to these names, are often talked about, and readers, when they read these names, are also invariably respectful, complimenting them as "literary giants." As for domestic writers, many are "unprincipled," and those who are principled are definitely not as great as foreign writers, which is also a recognized fact. However, even though foreign literary giants are great, no one wants to read their works. Conversely, even though domestic writers are "unprincipled," their articles can still be popular.</p>
<p>The relationship between writers and articles, among Chinese readers, has become so disparate that it is truly strange. But this history has been long. Many years ago, Xu Zhimo, such a "poet philosopher," already admired "Call to Arms" while completely denying the personality of the author of "Call to Arms." As for the translated versions of the works of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gorky, and other writers whose great names have been heard for a long time, they have remained scarce for the past twenty years.</p>
<p>The reason, most people say, lies in the poor quality of the translations. "Literal translation" and "hard translation" are incomprehensible, and "smooth translation" is not very trustworthy. The translation world has not yet invented a proper translation method: so people simply don't read them. As for the works of domestic writers, whether good or bad, they first of all get a straightforward reception, so there are always more people who love to read them, especially now when people treat reading articles as pure leisure.</p>
<p>Whether creative writing or translation, it is nothing more than a commodity today. Since translations have no customers, many translators have also put down their pens. In the corners of several magazines, one or two translations are occasionally embellished, just like hanging a homespun underpants next to fine silk in a brothel, it is just "unable to avoid vulgarity, just so."</p>
<p>However, this time, the "Literature" magazine has specially published a translation special issue, and aims to "slightly show a glimpse of the current state of world literature, and hope to use this to arouse discussion on various translation issues." It has a great intention to save the situation from collapse. This is a very noteworthy thing in the literary world in recent years. The relationship between world literature and China, and the future of the Chinese translation world, will depend on the outcome of this move.</p>
<p>I have already finished reading this special issue, which contains writers from twelve countries, various genres, a total of twenty pieces of writing. These twenty articles are not all top choices in world literature, but they are not necessarily worse than China's first-class works. As for the translation style, they can all make people feel effortless and reassured when reading. I originally wanted to make a critique of each article, but unfortunately, I don't understand the popular critical formula of "...very good, but...makes people dissatisfied, but...still...besides...a little...as for...is very noteworthy."</p>
<p>I can only say in general, these twenty articles will not necessarily make you feel flawless, but they will definitely not make you gain nothing. And what is particularly noteworthy is the many opinions on translation in the "Forum."</p>
<p>Following this special issue, "Literature" will also publish a "Creative Writing Special Issue." If you read this special issue first, and then read the next issue, then you will have a deeper understanding of the issues of world literature and translation.</p>
<h3>Bathe in the Yi River, Enjoy the Breeze at the Rain Altar</h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>Now, there are already people advocating governing the world with half of the "Analects"! In the past, I believed this. Because at that time, the ways of managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world that the teacher taught me never went beyond the "Four Books," and the "Great Learning," "Doctrine of the Mean," and "Mencius" were really just Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius inheriting Confucius's intentions. Naturally, the "Analects," which records Confucius's own holy words and deeds, would be the representative. In fact, I myself didn't particularly like using those words and deeds as standards to rectify my heart and cultivate myself to reach that initial step. However, I still remember a few words that really captivated me, and that is:</p>
<p>"In late spring, when the spring clothes are ready, with five or six adults and six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze at the Rain Altar, and returning while singing."</p>
<p>Whenever I read this passage, I felt that the Confucius in the teacher's mouth was really unreliable. Confucius was not a solemn and unapproachable person. At least he wasn't as rigid as my teacher, who specifically forbade students from swimming in the river and singing along the way. Therefore, I also resented my rigid teacher very much. At the same time, a kind of hope grew in my heart day by day along with that resentment: I only hoped for an opportunity to bathe in the Yi River and enjoy the breeze at the Rain Altar, so that I could personally experience that feeling.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I finally got this opportunity. On the third day after I arrived in Qufu, taking advantage of the leisure time before the school started, I went to the Rain Altar with several colleagues to "observe the wind." At that time, it was still the cold first month of the year, and no one really wanted to enjoy the breeze, so we only said we were going to observe. It is said that the Rain Altar was the place where earth dances were held during the time of the State of Lu. People living in Qufu probably love to say that any so-called historical site or scenic spot came from the State of Lu or that Confucius once did this or that here. I don't necessarily believe this "it is said," and naturally it is not easy to develop extra interest because of it. This altar, in name, is said to be an altar, but in reality, it is a small hill, so small that it is as big as a grave mound. On top of it stands a stele, like a vertical, lidless box, or like a vertical, lidless coffin. The words on the stele are no longer very clear. Next to it is an old but short tree of some kind, and the rest of the place is completely bald, with hardly any small trees to be found. The surroundings are full of wheat fields, and to take a shortcut, you still have to walk through the green wheat fields. If it weren't for its fame, I think even people passing by would only sit on the ridges of the wheat fields to take a breath and would not go up there again. Thus, the saying "came with enthusiasm, left with disappointment" became a true depiction of our day.</p>
<p>Later, when the summer vacation was approaching, it was still driven by a kind of curiosity that I invited several colleagues to swim in the Yi River. Leaving the city along the South Gate, a vast expanse of farmland and a small stream planted with trees on both sides first made people fascinated, thinking that the Yi River must be waiting for us "clear and rippling," and that we would soon be able to merge into its embrace. After walking for a long time and taking many twists and turns, we finally arrived at the Yi River that we had longed for, but we didn't know that it would be so disappointing. The shallow riverbed, the still river water, neither wide nor deep, was simply impossible to bathe in. But other colleagues had already jumped into the water first, and a childhood game reappeared before my eyes, so I had to quickly undress and jump down. The water was warm, and the greatest advantage was that it did not become turbid even after prolonged disturbance. It turned out that there was fine sand without soil underneath, so it seemed very turbid, but in fact it was very clear. Everyone used that fine sand to rub their bodies, and I did the same, feeling that it was a little smoother than ordinary sand. After getting ashore, they still used the dry sand on the shore to wash their feet, and they even used that dry sand to dry their feet and put on their shoes and socks directly! This made me a little surprised. At that time, I realized that this was the way to bathe here. So I was extremely happy and immediately ran to the Rain Altar with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This time, returning to the Rain Altar was no longer as disappointing as before. The cool breeze softly brushed against my face, immediately making me feel the warmth of the two sentences, "The southern breeze is gentle, it can relieve the people's worries." At that time, it can truly be said that I was happy and forgot my worries, and fully experienced the true meaning of "bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze at the Rain Altar."</p>

<h3>"Old Wine Can't Be Put in New Bottles"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ke</p>
<p>In China, not to mention periodicals and magazines, even for daily newspapers, those that sell over ten thousand copies probably number only two or three. This clearly demonstrates that the number of citizens who can read and afford newspapers is just this many. This can be considered a unique characteristic of China, or to put it bluntly, it's actually quite a sad situation.</p>
<p>In previous years, there were indeed people advocating for a "literacy movement." Now, it seems everyone avoids even mentioning it. I believe the reason is that most of those educators from the "May Fourth Movement" who considered themselves progressive are now very busy. Some are running around with national affairs, some are attending international academic conferences, and some are even retreating into the mountains and forests, composing poems, drinking wine, telling jokes, and writing letters, leaving them with no time to attend to "this."</p>
<p>However, the illiterate, or rather, those who have no way to become literate among the Chinese population, are still unintentionally receiving a kind of education. In major cities, on the cement sidewalks of roads, and at the iron gates of alleys, one can often see men and children who look very unkempt, crowding around to look at "comic strip pictures." They are satisfying their thirst for knowledge through the intuitive art form. As a result, their minds are filled with emperors and deities. Superstition and the mentality of servitude still tightly bind their hearts.</p>
<p>Recently, however, due to discussions in several magazines about a certain literary issue, one or two writers who genuinely care about mass education have been drawn from written language to the "comic strip pictures" in art, wanting to advocate for a movement to improve "comic strip pictures." This is truly gratifying. However, some have raised objections, believing that "old wine cannot be put in new bottles" and that a new artistic educational tool should be "created." Recently, some daily newspapers in Shanghai have indeed been trying to create new forms of "comic strip pictures." However, the effects of these attempts are quite interesting, either resulting in "the intellectual class considering it not art, while the masses still cannot understand it," or ending up with neither the masses nor the intellectual class being able to understand it. Naturally, we cannot draw conclusions on the issue based on this single experience, but from this alone, we can learn a lesson: that before the old society is thoroughly reformed, trying to immediately change a trend or habit is extremely difficult. We can only utilize it as much as possible and gradually transform it. Therefore, based on the lessons of reality, I believe that we should still accept the old form of "comic strip pictures" conditionally and incorporate new ideas into it as much as possible.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that in literature, conditionally utilizing the old form of chapter novels, which are more popular among the petty bourgeoisie, is also a similarly important issue.</p>
<p>In short, regarding this type of issue, all those who are still genuinely concerned about mass education really need to bring it up again for discussion.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from a Journey West (5)</h3>
<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>After the train passes Zhengzhou, it is no longer a sandy plain. The low-lying areas and ravines on both sides gradually increase, but although they are ravines, there is no water. Now, they are all roads for people or vehicles to travel. Our train travels among the low hills from time to time. There are many trees on both sides. Tall and straight poplars stand in a continuous row. Afterward, the hills gradually become higher, the ravines become lower, and the train also travels slower. Holes one after another up, down, left, and right, these are the old houses people live in today. They live in such places, wearing ragged clothes, eating black bread, and the fruits of their labor must still be supplied to the officials for cement, silk, Western food, cars, and all luxuries.</p>
<p>The road becomes more and more difficult to travel. The train often tilts, and ravines dozens of feet deep appear from time to time beside the tracks. The driver drives as if approaching a deep abyss, driving particularly slowly, cautiously and gently. After dragging more than half of the train carriages, he suddenly drives quickly, fearing that the rear carriages will fall into the pit, as if wanting to drag them over regardless of life or death. The hills on both sides whistle and roar, helping him. The train also whistles from time to time, rumbling into the dark mountain tunnels, passing through one after another, a total of eleven to Luoyang.</p>
<p>On the train, I saw the White Horse Temple from afar, and also saw the ruins of a mausoleum. When I asked someone, they said it was Emperor Xian of Han's. As the train entered the Luoyang boundary, I saw tall tombstones all the way, presumably the family tombs of officials of all sizes in the past. In the fields, the raised mounds of earth, the size of water vats, foot basins, and face basins, are the graves of the common people. In a few years, these water vat-sized mounds will become foot basin-sized; foot basin-sized mounds will become face basin-sized; and face basin-sized mounds will be plowed into flat ground, and things will be planted on them, and they will no longer be recognizable. For the sake of land production, this is correct. If every dead person were buried like the customs of my hometown or like the way the nobles here do it, then after many years, the cultivable land would gradually become narrower, and the world would become a true graveyard. Life is a grain of sand. Where is it forever?</p>
<p>A traveler who got off the train in Luoyang told me that the flies in Luoyang bite people, and when you kill them, you actually find blood coming out. I said, I'm afraid it's something like horseflies? But he said no, it's ordinary flies. I felt strange.</p>
<p>West of Luoyang, I often see a kind of pine and cypress tree, its leaves growing all the way down to the base of the trunk. It is said that when Zhao Kuangyin went to Tongguan, he was afraid that he would not recognize the way back, so he tied grass to the lower end of the tree trunks all the way, and therefore later it became like this kind of tree.</p>
<p>From Luoyang to Tongguan, we passed through fourteen or fifteen more mountain tunnels, with the Xiashi Post Station being the longest. After passing Baozi, we could see the Yellow River at any time. The steep and secluded danger, this kind of place, has now been passed. Although the train travels on newly opened flat roads, it is still dangerous enough. The only thing that disappointed me was that the mountains were all barren soil, and it was almost impossible to see even a small stone. The color was neither red-yellow nor black, but a lifeless color close to yellow but not yellow, close to white but not white. And it is so loose that it can collapse at any time, just like human life.</p>

<h3>Last Testament (4)</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Yina is in Xi Zhuoyun's office.</p>
<p>"Very good; you've written it well, thank you."</p>
<p>"I wonder which issue it will be published in?"</p>
<p>"Today is Monday. It's too late for Wednesday, the manuscripts have already been submitted. It's also too late for Saturday. I think next Wednesday I've already discussed it with He Jiemu, and asked him to make a small ending to his novel so that yours can be published. Let me tell him again; I think next Wednesday will be possible, at most one more issue apart, until next Saturday."</p>
<p>"Can I get all the publication fees within the year?" After hesitating for a second or two, she finally asked.</p>
<p>"You're also waiting for money?" Smiling, as if not believing it.</p>
<p>She nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>"As long as it can be published in one or two issues within the year, and it can be published within the year," Zhuoyun said without hesitation.</p>
<p>"I also want to sell the copyright fee, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you can."</p>
<p>"Can I get the money at the time?"</p>
<p>"It's probably not a problem Wang Zhonghua also wanted money for the Mid-Autumn Festival, so he sold the copyright of his "Cold Night." Thirteen said, and he got the money on the fourteenth."</p>
<p>"Then, thank you, please go and talk about it."</p>
<p>"But, it's best to have someone write a letter to me, writing about wanting to sell the copyright; with this letter, it's more convenient to talk about it."</p>
<p>Yina promised to send him the written letter in a day or two.</p>
<p>Two or three days after sending the letter, Yina called Xi Zhuoyun, asking him what the publishing department's reply was. Zhuoyun said that the reply had not yet come, but that "Taste of Life" had been decided to be published starting next Saturday. She knew that next Saturday was the 20th, and that from that issue, there would be three more issues that could be published within the year. As long as she could get the publication fees, even if the copyright couldn't be sold for a while, it wouldn't matter much, so she wasn't too uneasy in her heart.</p>
<p>That fateful Saturday arrived. As soon as Yina woke up, she asked Li Ma to bring her the newspaper for the day. She hurriedly looked for new book advertisements. She found the Literary Semimonthly, but in the table of contents, there was no "Taste of Life." The name of its author, Chen Yina, did not show the slightest trace.</p>
<p>Her heart was beating fast.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Silver Reserves Total 560 Million</h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>Recently, the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China announced that Shanghai's silver reserves total 560 million yuan, of which more than 280 million yuan are deposited in Chinese merchant banks, and more than 270 million yuan are deposited in foreign banks. It is estimated that China's total silver reserves are only more than one billion yuan (previously seen in a certain statistic, it seems to be 1.2 or 1.3 billion yuan, I don't know if there are any errors, but it is probably this number), and Shanghai alone accounts for more than 40% of the total; and among this more than 40%, foreign banks account for slightly less than one-half. This is truly an alarming ratio.</p>
<p>Why has China's economy developed this kind of deformed form? Undoubtedly, it is because of the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the interior, and the concentration of cash in the cities, resulting in such an obese phenomenon. This is common sense that most people know.</p>
<p>Then, what is the only use of such a huge amount of silver reserves in Shanghai? Here, let's look at the business conditions of various banks in Shanghai. According to the Shenbao Yearbook; the general business conditions of 28 banks, including the Central Bank, members of the Shanghai Banking Association in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the total assets of various banks were 2.5 billion 36,000 yuan, of which negotiable securities accounted for 234.767 million yuan. Although this amount is not very large compared to the total assets, it is still alarming when viewed in terms of the ratio of various asset departments. In addition, there are huge investments in real estate. As for the amount of loans, although there are more than 1.5 billion, in which department is most of this 1.5 billion loan invested? Because we have not seen the business classification table of the above banks, we cannot determine it. But it is probably not mostly invested in the production sector, this is certain. This only needs to look at the crisis of our country's national industry in recent years, and we can know that prudent bankers will never be willing to invest useful money in dangerous areas, then most of the assets can only be used for speculative undertakings. From this point, we can also see that in China's economy in recent years, not only is the countryside bankrupt, but also the productive enterprises in the cities have reached a state of decline.</p>
<p>50% of Shanghai's silver reserves are deposited in foreign banks, which shows that China's economy as a whole is a colonial economy; and the degree of this colonial economy is only deepening year by year. The economic lifeline of the whole country is almost entirely controlled by foreign banks. The so-called Chinese merchant banks are just looking up to them.</p>
<p>Not only do Chinese merchant banks have to rely on foreign banks, but foreign banks also directly control China's entire politics. Politics depends on the economy, this is certain. Whoever has money can manipulate whomever. Foreign banks hold such economic hegemony in China, how can they not go on to influence politics? There are many examples, and there is no need to list them all here.</p>
<p>Why do foreign banks hold such huge silver reserves in China? Undoubtedly, they all come from our people. In addition to indirectly taking it from the Chinese countryside, there are also a large number of feudal classes and comprador classes in China, who deposit a large amount of people's wealth that they have plundered into foreign banks for the sake of "safety." In this way, foreign banks become even more affluent.</p>
<p>The countryside is extremely bankrupt, the national industry has reached the final crisis, all the cash in China is concentrated in the cities, and half of it flows into foreign banks (an even larger amount flows overseas). Chinese merchant banks invest most of this urban floating capital in securities, real estate and other speculative undertakings. What will the result be?</p>
<h3>I Am So Young</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>I am so young!</p>
<p>According to my age, I am not qualified to be a primary school teacher who makes a living by using my voice; but, who would have thought that I</p>
<p>have been one for two full years already.</p>
<p>The powder of chalk is about to bury my youth!</p>
<p>Once, a child in the sixth grade, who was much taller than me, sincerely asked me in the classroom:</p>
<p>"Is Teacher Wang a middle school graduate?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How old is Teacher Wang? You look so young!" His facial expression told me how much he envied me!</p>
<p>My eyelashes could no longer hold back my tears I suddenly cried.</p>
<p>All the children in the classroom were surprised and were softly inquiring about the reason why I was crying who would know.</p>
<p>One of the children stood up and questioned the child who had asked me the question earlier:</p>
<p>"What did you say to offend Teacher Wang?"</p>
<p>Quiet quiet...</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps moved to my front, and stammering words were sent to my ears:</p>
<p>"Teacher Wang; what did I say to offend Teacher Wang, you can punish me you can punish me..."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he also started to cry.</p>
<p>I pushed him away and said to them with a sob:</p>
<p>"There's nothing I just thought I was so young, and I started crying."</p>
<p>From then on, the children never dared to mention the word "young" in front of me again.</p>
<p>I am so young!</p>
<p>The powder of chalk is about to bury my youth!</p>
<p>Another time, I was looking at a few little babies in the kindergarten on the playground jumping rope actively, doing two and then counting:</p>
<p>"Two! Four! Six! Eight! Ten!..."</p>
<p>How interesting!</p>
<p>I walked over:</p>
<p>"Good babies! I'll come too, okay?"</p>
<p>The little babies looked at me, smiled, shook their heads, and said:</p>
<p>"No, no! We can't beat you, you're the teacher!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, they dragged the rope and ran away.</p>
<p>I turned around, and the sentence "You are the teacher" got into my heart; returning to my bedroom, I lay down on the pillow and cried again.</p>
<p>I can't squeeze into the children's team anymore.</p>
<p>But, I am so young!</p>
<p>The powder of chalk is about to bury my youth!</p>

<h3>A Lesson in Dealing with the World</h3>
<p>— Jianshe</p>
<p>Commerce, I have no way to name it. To put it bluntly, it is that even rotten goods are advertised as good goods for sale, and even sow meat is advertised as good pork. This is what is called commerce.</p>
<p>Originally, many things are always like this. Unless you actually delve into the core of those things, you will never know whether these things are good or bad. The reason for this is that many things have their own different and exceptionally beautiful exteriors. Usually, people without sharp eyes are always unable to see whether these things are good or bad.</p>
<p>Therefore, so-called intermediaries are needed here. In the field of literature and art, so-called critics are needed. Obviously, the task of these intermediaries and critics is to use their sharp eyes to tell us the actual situation. For example, this cup of tea is bitter and really cannot be drunk. In this way, we will naturally avoid it.</p>
<p>However, this will annoy people. And if this kind of thing continues to develop, it will definitely eliminate commerce.</p>
<p>Annoying people and eliminating commerce are both bad. To be a person, one must be a person who pleases everyone. The tea is bitter, let others drink it; it is clearly sow meat, let others buy it. At most, you will feel somewhat uncomfortable in your heart, but in reality, you must not provoke real enemies. If you are smart, you will not only not expose the truth about this bitter tea, but instead, you will promote everywhere that the tea leaves in a certain place are good, and that it is not worth living a lifetime if you do not buy some to drink. In this way, you will not only have tea to drink without spending a penny, but the tea merchant will also give you some extra money.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you are of course the most adept at dealing with the world. On the one hand, commerce can be developed, and on the other hand, you can also become rich.</p>
<p>There are probably many such people among the four hundred million compatriots. However, although some people act quite like and are used to it, they are still a bit vague about the theory, so I specially take some time to write it down, hoping that people with intentions will choose to adopt it.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of Mood</h3>
<p>— Liu An</p>
<p>Last year, Peng Jiahuang died of illness. When the literary and art circles held a memorial service for him, I thought to myself that a person who struggled bitterly with life finally died in defeat, and that the road of life is really difficult to walk; later, Zhu Xiang committed suicide by drowning himself. When the magazine published a special issue for him, I thought to myself that a person who could not fight against the oppression of life even committed suicide. On the one hand, it showed bravery, and on the other hand, it showed weakness. In the end, life should be lived bravely. The deaths of these two people did not stir up the waves in my heart. This year, Ai Xia committed suicide by taking medicine, and the newspapers mourned her endlessly. I just said that people are too serious about life, and there is only one way for him to go, which is suicide. Recently, I suddenly had the idea of praising suicide, but the motive was inexplicable even to myself. In the deep of night, thinking deeply in bed, analyzing myself, I felt that my mood had really changed.</p>
<p>Could it be that I am becoming pessimistic because of the suffering of politics? But this kind of pessimistic mood did not just arise now. To put it closer, it was last year, and to put it further, it was three years ago. Last year, I announced that I would not ask about politics, which was a public matter. Three years ago, I published a collection of novels, all of which were nihilistic works, but people didn't pay attention to it. The pessimism of my heart is not enough to prove the origin of the idea of praising suicide, this is obvious.</p>
<p>The old fisherman repeatedly begged for mercy from the thugs, but he had already been beaten until his head was bleeding. The two young fishermen saw that he was pitiful, so they carried him back from the gate of the Ding family. They just sighed coldly all the way; they never thought about how to resist oppression!</p>
<h3>Fishing and Killing the Family</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>Xiao En and his daughter fished until late, then returned home along the way; the neighboring fishermen told them that the old fisherman had been beaten for owing fish tax! His leg was badly injured; his ear was bleeding a lot. Xiao En sighed after hearing this: "It's too hard to be poor!"</p>
<p>However, I also have the idea of praising suicide, but I don't want to commit suicide. Instead, I yearn to live on, no matter what, I have to live on. I feel trembling about death. This is a contradiction, and it is even more terrible than wanting to commit suicide. Thinking carefully in the quiet night, and analyzing it, it is because I already have the heart of an old man. According to age, I am in my prime, but now I already have the heart of an old man. What hope do I want to say about life?</p>
<p>Old people don't want to die, so there are no old people who commit suicide; but old people are not serious about life, and live casually. This is what is frightening. My mood is now changing like this, probably a sign that everything is over, alas!</p>
<h3>The Old Fisherman</h3>
<h3>Xiao En Xiao Guiying Fisherman</h3>
<h3>Wishing to Be Reincarnated as a Man in the Next Life</h3>
<p>— Qi Ping</p>
<p>It is difficult to be a person, and it is even more difficult to be a woman. Although some people think that women always take advantage everywhere, in fact, this is just superficial talk. Looking at our old star, Ms. Wang Hanlun, being fed foot dirt and nasal mucus by her husband, we can know how difficult it is to be a woman.</p>
<p>Apple face, cherry lips, what does it matter to you? Eyes like autumn waves, waist like willow branches, all of these are born of heaven, how can I be a demon! Why bother the poets and writers, who use their writing skills to spread paper and soak ink, to criticize and scold women, whether horizontally or vertically, and to make a lot of four-six essays on snow, moon, wind, and flowers. The modern brothers then fill the pages with sisters! Darling! and embellish some sensual poems, making people's flesh shudder, so it seems that without women, one cannot write articles, but to write articles, one cannot do without women. Let's not mention this for the time being, but some are even more absurd and unexpected, even pushing the matter of China's extermination onto women. What about King Zhou being destroyed by Daji, King You being destroyed by Bao Si, and Dong Zhuo undoubtedly being killed by Diao Chan, and the recent loss of the three northeastern provinces, also seems to be because of a certain lady's winking eyes, which made our young general happy and confused about how he lost such a large area of 30 million square miles! Ah! So indiscriminately, openly insulting my female compatriots, it really makes me, a crowd of women, want to jump into the Huangpu River to clear myself!</p>
<p>In the offices and on the roads, from the well-dressed gentlemen in suits and leather shoes to the rough-footed peddlers, what makes people spit and savor is nothing more than women. Whose girl's eyebrows are thick, whose girl's thighs are white, it seems that there is nothing to say other than this. Originally, women in the eyes of men are just playthings. When they like you, they will be so diligent to call you elder sister that you can hardly believe it. When they are tired of playing with you, then it is not to mention that they will turn their heads and leave, strangers on the road, it is all the same. And the virginity of young girls is destroyed in this unconsciousness. How dangerous! How difficult it is to be a woman!</p>
<p>Women, women have their own indelible achievements. What kind of Confucius is he, daring to make such a bold statement as: "Only women and villains are difficult to raise." The words are so absurd, not only insulting his mother, but simply insulting my sisters all over the world. Probably the old gentleman must have been frustrated in love, or at least received the cold shoulder from women, so a burst of resentment, unable to suppress it, so he bit words and came up with such slanderous words, as a means of revenge.</p>
<p>Before! Women could only be confined to their boudoirs, not allowed to take a step outside the door. A good pair of natural feet had to be tied as tightly as bamboo slips, in order to convey a smile to the philanderers. Now, although it is said that they are liberated, they can also work in society, but what else is there besides getting the beautiful name of a vase? Ah! Unfortunate to be born a woman, even more unfortunate to be a Chinese woman!</p>
<p>In silk tents and embroidered quilts, everyone has a share in the soul-consuming truth, but once the evil root is planted, I will be pregnant, which is so unsightly, and at the time of childbirth, my liver and intestines will be like a machine. As the ancients said: "A pregnant woman has one foot in the coffin and the other foot outside the coffin." If you are not careful, there is a risk of death, but the cangs can be carefree and lead their lives of picking flowers and dyeing willows. What else in the world is more unfair than this?</p>
<p>This life is over, but the future can be pursued. I only hope that in the next life, I will be reincarnated as a fair and handsome young man, then it will be almost the same, Amitabha!</p>
<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Brief Records of Hometown Life</p>
<p>After eating dinner, we sat in the main room. The kerosene lamp cast large, terrifying shadows across the three sections of the hall. The child slept soundly in my wife's arms, but her hand continued to pat him rhythmically, humming a tune that even she could barely hear. Mother held her water pipe and smoked, replacing each pipeful with a fresh one. Perhaps she also felt the joy of her son, daughter-in-law, and grandchild being reunited at home—a joy deep within her heart, because she never showed a smiling face to anyone else, living so hysterically alone in this dilapidated old house. I sat under the light, reading the day's newspaper. I had never read the newspaper so carefully, especially since I had already glanced through it in the morning. I was conflicted, half clinging to this dilapidated old house, and half thinking about throwing myself into the arms of my second hometown, Shanghai, again at this time tomorrow.</p>
<p>The wind blew across the roof, creating a resonant sound. If it were midnight, one would surely suspect the house was about to collapse. However, I had grown accustomed to it in the last two days, and Mother certainly even more so. Its howling came in gusts and did not attract the attention of any of us, and everything remained silent, except for my wife's humming. The kerosene lamp was suddenly swayed by a gust of wind blowing in through the paper window, and the three large shadows on the wall swayed along with it. My wife yawned, as if speaking to the child, "Let's go to sleep." Everyone seemed to be waiting for these words, stretching or yawning. Mother stood up holding her water pipe and said, "Go to bed early, you have to catch the early train tomorrow." Although she said that, her eyes were fixed on the roof, as if hesitatingly thinking about something; or perhaps it was, "Stay another day before you leave." No matter how bitter enemies were at first, after a long separation, one would somewhat feel the possibility of becoming friends again; moreover, it was ultimately her son in name, and she had also fulfilled her wish to hold a little child. It should be a blessing to be such a wife; but her son, who had not returned for four or five years, was soon to leave again. People are, after all, emotional, especially middle-aged women, and she certainly knew that in the near future she would be an old woman with graying hair. Living alone in this dilapidated old house, could she not recall her days as a girl, the sweet period after her marriage, the sorrow of losing her two sons, and the loneliness of living in this house alone for so many years? Her eyes remained fixed on the roof, perhaps thinking about the past? I stood up sadly and said, "Mom, go to sleep, it's late." I myself didn't understand why I said such a thing, as it was actually earlier than early, the 5:30 PM movie hadn't even ended yet.</p>
