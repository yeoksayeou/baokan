<h3 id="c15">論巴爾幹各國集團化之意義 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據十三日國民社羅京電。巴爾幹各國現正謀訂立第二巴爾幹公約俾前次未加入保加利亞。得以加入云云。此舉如能成功。則巴爾幹各國之集團化。卽告完成。同時其在國際舞臺上之地位亦必愈臻重要茲姑就巴爾幹各國之形勢。一論其意義之所在。</p>
<p>今可稱之爲巴爾幹國家者。其數有六。（一）羅馬尼亞。（二）南斯拉夫（三）希臘（四）土耳其。（五）保加利亞（六）阿爾巴尼亞。此六國中。羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫。本爲小恊約集團中之國家。保加利亞爲歐戰時德奥之與國戰後對羅馬亞南斯拉夫希臘三國。割地賠欵。損失甚鉅。其處境之悲慘與戰後之德奥同故其企求。卽在和約之修改。意識上頗與高唱改組國聯之墨索里尼相接近阿爾巴尼亞。事實上已成意大利之保護國。亦爲意大利侵略巴爾幹半島之根據地至於希臘與土耳其。本爲世仇。唯自去冬雙方訂立互不侵犯條約以及最近</p>
<p>巴爾幹公約成立之後。不獨前嫌盡捐。抑且和好逾常矣。　　由此以觀巴爾幹之國家。已漸次走入小恊約集團之軌範上除國小民貧之阿爾巴尼亞外。意大利於巴爾幹半島已鮮與國。卽保加利亞之傾向果將出於何方。亦難逆料。蓋就現勢論。保國已處於被包圍之地位。其勢不能與意大利爲地理上之聯絡。極爲明顯。此其一二則南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞對之多方拉攏不遺餘力。故保國之加入巴爾幹集團實爲意中事。以故意大利今後在巴爾幹半島上之發展。將受極大阻碍矣。</p>
<p>然巴爾幹國家之團結。非僅以之對意。亦卽以之對德。蓋此一運動之醖釀爲時雖久。特其所以能急切實現者。實以德國希脱拉之東進政策有以促成之。惟至意奥匈三國恊定成立之後。此一集團之目標始轉而對付意大利矣蓋小恊約各國之土地。推本溯源。皆從瓜分奥匈帝國而來故其政策。不利奥匈之復强。而利奥匈之孤立。因此不論德奥合併。抑或意奥匈聯合。皆爲彼國所忌。以爲苟有一於此。卽足搖動中歐之均勢。危及巴爾幹半島上之安全增强戰敗國之修約運動也。故質實言之。今日巴爾幹各國之集團化。實爲小恊約集團之擴張。旣不利德亦不利於意大利勢力之進展惟能於外交上東西呼應遙爲聲援者。厥爲歐西之法國耳。設保加利亞更能加入。則實爲法國外交上之一大勝利。蓋法國擁有此等集團。則平時可挾國聯中之多數以制德意戰時以可使德意在地理上陷於被包圍之地位。其情勢固甚明瞭者也。</p>

所用的鞋油、原來爲增加光澤，並使皮質潤濕柔軟而用的，所以每星期擦一二次已可，假使過了一個月，那末須用軋士林（汽油）在鞋面滿拭一次，因爲鞋面上逐日和鞋油積下的污垢，經過軋士林一拭，就會脱落的。再用牛奶數滴輕輕潤濕亦好。木材傢具　　家庭中的桌椅和其他小形的木材器具，如經過油漆的，要想發生光澤，簡單的方法，是用蠟質摩擦，就是（一）用白蠟及蜜蠟二兩，放在淸潔的鍋內溶解，上面加上滑光油少許，Ｔｅｒｅ－ｂｅｎｅ（滑光油是從公樹類的滲出淮液照蒸溜法製成的）下面所燒的火，要遠而小，等到油蠟混化，徐徐攪拌，變成爲漿糊様子，再用布片嘗上摩擦，依自己所喜的顏色，先在木番上刷過，再加上這蠟油，那末其光澤比抛力司（洋漆）還要美艶。（二）用水蠟八分，松脂二分，ＶａｎｉｓｔｅｒＢｅｎ油○·五混和溶解，再加滑光油少許，調成如薄奶油様子，先把器具用肥皂水洗凈，曬乾用布片拭上此液，擦時先緩後快，光澤愈顯。（三）用加拿巴蠟三兩，仍照前法溶解，再加滑油六兩，塗在器上，很爲堅固，比第一第二兩法更爲適宜，（四）委尼吸Ｖａｒｎｉｓｈ漆的使用，（卽用酒精樹脂滑光油，愛退油等混合溶解的，俗稱假漆）大凡木器上漆委尼吸的傢伙，倘若上面放過熱的東西，那就要剥脱的，我們要修好這影迹，可用沈降炭酸石灰一瓢，酒精半杯，馬爾水爾粉末胞皂少許混合一起，拭了二三回，過了二三分鐘，再用濕布摩擦，再用亞麻仁油三勺，醋二勺，酒精一勺，滑光油三勺混和，輕輕揩上，那就很光麗了。毛織品的耐久　　大凡毛織品等用舊後，很容易破斷的，顏色亦因汗污而變，假使要從新編結，可先把毛綫解散，套在竹圈上，放在飯鍋上一蒸，那末毛綫的力，就很强固，其已壞的毛綫，那可添上新綫，混和搓起，就很耐久了。肥皂的分别　　使用肥皂，依物理的吸收作用，固然可以除脱垢污，然而嬌嫩的皮膚，一經肥皂洗滌，就要變爲粗糙，這因爲肥皂中含有亞爾加里Ａｌｋａｌｉ的緣故，亞爾加里係溶化於水的鹽基，其水溶液，能使紅的利德馬司Ｌｉｌｍｕ變爲綠色的，我們如把肥皂的薄片，溶於酒精內，加上ｐｂｅｎｏｌｐｈｔｈａｌｉｎ（帶黃白色結晶狀的粉末，醫藥上用作緩瀉藥　少許，倘若變爲紅色，那可判定其有游離亞爾加里了。平常選　肥皂，應當揀其細泡多的，市上所售的各式各様肥皂，雖然混合了藥品，具有殺菌力，可是亞爾加里很多的肥皂，反而要傷害皮　哩去帽污垢　　帽子因爲塵垢所污，普通多用汽油吸取油垢，現在有一種簡單的法子，就是用軟的麵包，在塵垢上摩擦，等到塵垢脱落爲度，旣不傷帽的質，又能煥然一新。</p>

<p>自由談	街頭  濤　　　華洋雜處的上海街上，在夏天，可以看見赤　的苦力，和赤露着肩背的外國娘兒們。　　時下巴黎女人最摩登的服裝，好像除了臂上　有跳脱外，幾乎完全　袒着肩背，及前胸的一大部分。換言之，也是赤膊。　　不以體力而分優劣，同様的愚蠢，我們看到黃種和白種半裸的形態時，總不免有天上和地下之感。其間文化距離相隔太遠嗎？貧富的懸殊嗎？種性的優劣麽？···　　文化的進展，據説其道如螺旋，好像歸到原來的地方，而實是高了若干層了，這一説好像出自歌德，，也許很能包括的吧。天暑，口渴欲吃冰淇淋，此外國科學之所賜，古代有「臧冰」，是天然冰，在夏天吃的，漢唐皆有這種習慣，然同一飲冰，情形就頗有高下之分了。　　在一個藝術的眼光看來，筋肉皆是素描的藍本，雕刻的典型；或許一位醫士的眼中的這許多背膀，又另有可注意之處吧，猶之坐黃包車的人决不會想到車夫在還價時，已暗給自己估計體重的，太胖大他當然心驚。造化有主宰麽？如有主宰，則他當以爲一切生命本身之價值均等，一個中國人的生命，應該無異於一個西洋人的生命，無論其爲聖哲，爲愚夫，爲敗類，····　　論文化，我們是古國，論才智，黃種人大槪超過白人；論富庶，我們中國的地利，高於西洋。然而眼前何至這麽有雲泥之分呢？粗粗一看，一者是天仙化人，一者是鳩盤茶；一者是大神金剛，一者是地獄餓鬼，其分别的原由何在呢？更何况，中國人之和平博大，在世界上大有存在之理由！　　如果因這一點眼前所見的小現象推想開去，其終極也，將要救國。新建築  壯草　　　　沿着新安江直向西溯，當快到淳安縣城的時光，第一個躍入你眼　裏裹的，便是那座聳立在「縣後山」尖上的碉樓。碉樓，可説是淳安空前未有的新奇建築。因爲淳安在建築物上，向來是極其貧乏的，除了幾座自前朝遺下的祠堂廟宇外，簡直不能再找到别的；然而現在，竟然攢出了這座碉樓，莊嚴地峙踞在那兒，眞有目空全淳之慨呢！　　椆樓的建築已逹三年。當初聽説是上司連夜趕令到縣，限期完成，縣長接令，立卽吩咐村長ＸＸＸ，呌他快去辦裏完竣具報，村長於是馬上開始工作，挨户計丁去捐錢，没錢的捐力···它竟在限定的時間裏完成了。丨聽説總共費了兩千多塊錢哩！椆樓的形狀好似個小閣，圓圓的身，尖尖的頂···　　然而，在某一短短的時期裏，縣民曾迷幻着裏面的奇跡，以爲有什麽砲　呀，地雷呀···究竟造了兩千多塊錢啦，總不曾僅只這一個空殼吧！因之縣民們以訛傳訛，莫敢走近它，好似怕裏面的奇跡遽被發現，更好似怕裏面的危險，就要挨到已身的様子。　　丨不知怎的，縣民忽然爭呶着··　　「丨這有什麽用呢？」　　「丨防候敵人哪！」　　「丨防候敵人丨　·····」　　「丨呵！哈，哈，哈···」漸漸地縣民把它淡忘掉，然而一堤及它，總有人説··　　「丨兩千多塊錢做這個碉樓，眞够好！」ＸＸ　ＸＸ　ＸＸ到於今，碉樓裏面，····，那莊嚴的神氣確已喪失，不知多少了。然而似乎還要保持先前那種威勢的様子···歐靜麗Ｅｕｏｅｉｎｅ  白韋　在柏林把歐靜麗送走以後，玄便嗒然收拾了簡單的行李，趁着快車，回到巴黎，書房裏，臥室裏，一切都如舊，只不見了那姣美的歐靜麗姑娘！玄在寓所覺得坐立不寗，便在街上亂走，巴黎於他，也只是一座空城了！　　第二天，他接到歐靜麗從維也納寄來的航空信·　　我的最親愛的玄··分别的時候，我倒不覺得怎様難過·可是火車奔跑了相當的路程以後，那機輪的隆隆聲，驚　了我的白日夢·我才意識到我已經離開了你，而懷帶着你的一個小雛形，向家鄕進發了·我便啜泣起來·我細細檢點這巴黎覊旅的兩年，我只有感謝你·你的情愛，激發了我的初戀，調劑了我的太書本化的生活·我不知道我曾經使你苦痛　没有？你想··當我倆認　的時候，我只是一個不會體貼温柔的女孩呢！親愛的，你還記提得第一夜我倆同在歌　　看浮士德嗎？不説别的，我現在不是有些像浮士德的受人嗎？這不過是一　　喻，請你不要又因此　傷罷，你的小女友　靜麗　　玄捧着這信，大哭起來，歐靜麗是那様一個知情懂事的女孩，她還抱怨自己不會温柔體貼·便是這　的措辭，已够令玄銷魂了，這兩年來，　一直是玄的自利和享　主義下的犧牲！玄不許她有同　朋友；玄使　和家庭間有裂痕·她没有負玄，只有玄負了她！最後，她又爲了玄有孕，她一點不知道　尤·她的天眞，她的純樸，使她把一切都着成玫瑰色·便是這様，她竟懷帶着一　新生命回國去了，　　玄和歐靜麗的訂交，是在一個法國太太家裏，他倆同　房客·　　歐靜麗那時不過是一個十七歲的姑娘，却已經相當地成熟·她那白嫩的　　，靈活的一雙黑眼睛，一張唇紅齒白的小口，一頭似亂而整的　髮，一個豐滿的身體，　成了一個西方美的最高度的結晶！她的態度，高貴而温婉，却帶幾分　　，不是倨傲，也不是小家小户氣，她生長在多腦河下流的一個城市裏，到巴黎不過才兩個多月，她是個歷史學生·　　玄在巴黎却快一年了，他剛由一個旅舍搬到那法國太太家裏·第一天他被介紹見歐靜麗·當他輕輕地捻揑着她的白嫩的小手，領受了她那矜持而　腆的微笑時，一只瞬間，歐靜麗的一切美點，都被他發現了！他便暗自决定，要使她成爲他的密友。　　起初，他的倆的交際，很古典地進行着·他雖然邀請她到寓外去，也只是歌劇院，美術館這些上等娛樂地方·在寓內，他倆的聚談，總在客廳裏·稱呼起來，也還採用「小姐」，「先生」這些套語，可是他倆這種頻繁的接近，立刻引起同居男女的好奇心·因爲在玄没有住在這裏以前，歐靜麗不肯和任何人有稍深的交誼·便是對房主婦的女兒，她也只肯交換幾句極泛常的寒暄語·並通，她關在房裏，黃昏時按一兩曲鋼琴，自甘於極單調的生活，自從玄來到這裏以後，她底沉默和孤高的性格，很快地改變了，這自然使第三者驚異；大家就不期然而然地採取一種偵探的態度·這個發現，使歐靜麗無端地窘迫不安起來·她和玄雖然並没有什麽不可告人的秘密，她却不喜歡客廳外的人影憧憧，於是她勉徇玄的請求，以後便到玄私室裏去談話·這急進的親密，玄自然是滿心欣幸；歐靜麗却暗自奇詫·她不了解爲什麽這東方少年，對自己有　大的吸力！她由衷地覺和他　　在可以無　當受漂　ｂｅａｕ和　昂ｋｉｓｔｒｏｇｕｅ兩個形容詞，他那廣　的常識，幾次長途旅行的經歷，富於詩意的談吐，尤其是他對於她本國情形的熟習，對於她自己照應的殷　　到，使她没有方　不親近他，她想料不到··他是這様一個令她　意，令她高興的男子！她覺得從前没有玄，　底在巴黎的生活，是何等空虚，枯　·現在有了他，她生活中才添了新　，快樂，活潑各種不同的　分，玄對於她，已經不可少了！假如有一天，玄早晨出去，午餐在中　飯店吃了，工作完　，又被朋友拉去彈球，一直到晚餐前，才　寓所，這天　靜麗會無理由地忐忑着，感覺到這課餘的午後，是不可忍耐的無聊！她在房裏徘徊着。一聽到玄的敲在　上的脚步聲音，她像　去　負似地長　一口氣，立刻笑　　開，忙開門迎出來，　道了晚安以後，她便挽着他的臂，同到他私室裏。她滿心　悦，却不好意思説出自己的眞感情。他忍不住抱怨兩句··「出去一整天。我擔心着有什麽意外事呢。」玄受寵若驚地笑了。　　旣然在人們　聽以外，　私　又是最有利於愛情的温長的玄便慢慢地允許自己以　大的　　　　　　　　她的美麗，他竟敢吐　他的愛情，她　於玄這些　頌和表白，只是又驚又喜，她覺提他具有一股不可抵抗的熱　，她　　無　地接受着，玄知道這女孩的　心怦動，他便更進一步去挑　她，一天下午，他講着一篇中　的戀愛故事，歐靜麗也　　動情了，他竟不得她允許，　抱着她親吻趨來，她　　　了，她無法逃避，又不忍　　　他，她只有消極地接受了這　愛的　突，從此以後，玄對她便採用法語第二人稱中最親密的稱呼　和ｔｏｉ她開始覺得刺耳，接着自己對他，也　様地採用了關於「極微論」  徐懋庸　　我在一個刋物中紹介了金聖歎的一篇文章，那立意本極明白，也極平常，不過説，學篇作文，當注重觀察，對於極小的事物，倘加深刻的觀察，必有豐富的意義，可以作我之文科。注重實際的觀察，本不限於作文，研究科學又何嘗不然。天文學上用望遠鏡，化學上也用顯微鏡的。作文宜注重觀察，本不限於小品文，小説之類的大品文又何嘗不然。浪漫主義的文學偏重想像，自然主義的大師左拉則常至酒館賭塲中去親歷。金聖歎的那種見解，本没有可以反對之處的，然而竟有許多人反對了。有一位先生，甚而至於説··　　「中國的文人中，早已有人翻看「極微論」，準備模仿金聖歎，「潔身自好了」。文人是社會的先覺，早安排當亡國奴，則中國之亡，可立而待也」。　　這様的羅織，　在是少見的。翻看「極微論」、何以就是「凖備模仿金聖歎」，又何以就是「潔身自好，」又何以就是「安排亡國奴」？然而，我是知道這位先生的意思的，···不過從「極微論」到「亡國奴」，我覺得其道里還是很逮的。　　日本人是正在想亡人之國的，但他們的觀察之精細，却足使我們咋舌。譬如關於中國的事淸，凡我們自己所不知道的，他們無不淸淸楚楚地知道。他們之所以知道，是派了人在中國的各處在寳地視察的。然而，我們的「日本研究」呀，「蘇聯研究」呀，却大多數只是從普通的雜誌上譯過　篇文章來。　　　　説我們的文學罷，最近有一個刋物，提出「中國目前爲什麽没有停大的作品產生」的問題。這個問題的答案可以有許多，而「作家」與「題材」之疏遠亦是其一。「九一八」「一二八」，分明是偉大的事變，可以作爲偉大的作品的題材的。然而，我們的作家，對於還些事變，何所見乎？卽使是身在東北或上海，親歷這些事變的，也大多數因不暇觀察，事後所留的印象亦依稀彷彿，寫了出來也只能是依稀彷彿的東西。至於未嘗接近事變的核心的作家們，本也可以觀察事變所激起的各地的反應現象，描寫出事變的ｐｒｏｆｉｌ然而，仍由於没有觀察，所以我們連這様的作品也少見。　　一個偉大的題材所包含的細微的事象，不知凡幾，然而我們的作家，往往只能在他人搆成的輪廓丨或者　直可以説公式丨之下，作　臨的工作。最明白的例子，是去年的創作界對於豐收成災這個題材的處理。在包羅　廣大而複雜的農村的中國，在此崩潰期間，倘略加留心，不知有多省題材可以採取。而我們的作家，却份份去跟他人寫同一題材，甚且連結構也不能不雷同。今年有一位作家，覺將法捷耶夫的毀滅，每句改幾個安，算做自己的創作。這是我們的作家的貧乏之最悲劇的刨暴露。　　要救濟這貧乏，要中國能產生偉大的作品，根本當由作家們充實其生活，但這是不易言的。較易的還是注重觀察，把所要寫的題材先從各方面看個淸楚，而且從細微處多加留意。　是我介紹「極微論」的本意。病困雜記  嘯龍　　　來看我的朋友是很少的，因爲我這麽輕的毛病並没有想着去驚動人家。除了那帮助我進院的朋友夫婦倆來看過之外，唯一來伴着我的便是蘭。她帶來的一束鮮花，一叠報紙，是使我覺得比較許多人來看還要快樂一點的。　　　探視的時間是一切病人們的　最珍貴，最快樂的時間；可是這也是最難過的時間，倘若你看見了别人的探望者都來了，而你的却久候還不見的時候，　　你眞會心焦得要　命。記行有一天，我們的人都來了，剩下了那位學生的空屬還不曾來。過了一會，　　他的母親終於來了，那學生在熱望中迸出了這様的一句；「媽，我等了你多久呵！」　　聽了這句話，我心裏也被深深的感動了，我覺得這裏面正交流着悽楚和歡樂的淚水。　　寂寞的心呵！　　（八）食的慾望　　據説，在監獄裏面的囚犯，每天吃的，祇是給沙拦了的糙飯（？），而惟一的小菜，便是　菜。所以大家心裏常常夢想着的都是出來以後怎様地痛快的吃一頓。這情形和我們這些被關在病院的完全相像。前面已經説過，我們這四個人當中，祇有那個小孩可以隨意吃東西，因此他便變成了我們的羨慕的對象。因爲除他之外，我們三個都是被剥奪了吃的權利的。因患胃病而受過割治的銀行行員，其病在胃，自然不能隨意吃東西；那傷寒病患者的學生，關於食的方面更不能不加倍的小心和限制。至於我，喉嚨上有了重創，食物不消説是不能隨便通過的。所以我們三個人的食料，差不多都是一様稀粥，牛奶，或是咯咕粉之顃。而我更因爲傷口的關係不能吃熱的東西，什麽都要讓牠完全冷了才可以入口。記得頭一天因爲完全不能吃東西，第二天中午我的朋友送給我一大杯冰淇淋，這在我看來，　　眞無異是在沙漠中久旱一杯淸水。因爲在那時候我祇能吃冰淇淋，牠不特使我吃不　大感到疼痛，而且因爲冰冷的原故，倒使傷口非常舒服。　　我們的銀行行員和那位學生，整天互相酬答的話也多半是··「你想我能够吃麵包嗎？」，「我　什麽時候能够吃一點餅干呢？」或是，「我想再過兩天便可以吃點肉粥了吧？」等等之類。　　總之食的慾望是滿充了這房間，充滿了每一個人的夢幻的。　　（九）到别個監獄去　　前後在醫院過了三天，一連兩晚我也没有舒服地睡過。白天裏，那些看護們依着時刻的要這個要那個，結果反爲使我不能好好睡覺。我决定出院了。雖然我床頭掛着的一張病狀單是預塡好了五天的日期的。不知是不是照醫院的規矩，這様病是必得最少住上五天，不過我總靠我的朋友的力量，被許可放出來了。　　不久以前，看過了一部以牢獄爲背景的影片「亡命者」，片中有一段叙着一班犯人指着一個　　期滿出獄的人，和一副被虐刑而死的囚犯的棺材説··「在這裏祇有這兩種的出獄方式·」他們的意思自然是説出獄的方式除了期限已滿之外，便是被拷打死後把屍體體搬運出獄。我覺得這情形和出醫院眞十分相像，因爲這裏也祇有這兩種的方式··一種是病好了走出去，一種是從殮房搬出去。我是幸運地得依照了前者的。　　　過了三天的不自由的，苦悶的，難堪的日子，當我把那一套囚衣般的衣褲脱下，重換上我自己的衣服的時候，我覺得好像重得光明一般的快樂。告别了我的同房的可憐的伴侶，我走出了醫院的大門，隨卽去找我的一個素識的醫生。當他要我回家睡兩個星期，也不許隨便吃食物的時候，我立刻覺得我是從一個監獄出來，又被解到第二個監獄裏去了。　我記起「囚犯曲」中的一句··「明天我將被解到那新的監獄去····」完</p>

<p>電信特刊電界之聲電報平民化  履冰　　民衆　於電報之　　　　正確，民衆對於電報之興味，　覺缺之，加以匡救，已見前述；但提倡交際改着報務，辦法實施，或仍有未能普　利用之勢，斯由社會一般宋　電報多所接近之民衆，思盧所及，輒以電報之所以带有貴族色彩，貴之一字，實亦重大之原因。　　電報取費，自有其本身之沿革。我國之有電報，在滿淸光緖七年。斯時創辦伊始，各自爲政。報價之定，率在每字一角以上，甚有增高至二角者。其後以省府爲單位，於是同城同省或隔省，各異其價。民國以來，民國以來，迄乎近今，華文每字不分同省出省定爲一角，固已此從前爲廉矣；但多數憚於發電之民衆，其腦海中未免仍留『報價昂貴』之印象。普通寄一郵函，寄一快件，自數分至角餘卽可，而發一通電報，則以爲非大銀圓不可，且不祇一枚大銀圓也，恒須自枚而增至數枚。平民之物力　艱，平民之生計有限，以如此之高價，推想電報，電報受其枉，於是電報始終不會發逹。　　電報自有其立塲，與郵務航空，未容等量齊觀。此中比例，稍具常識者當易思索而得。前所欲言者，卽電界人士，對於報價問題，亦曾頗費考慮。合諸國內生活程度之高昂，維持材料之增漲，收入方面，彌補開支，已具捉襟見肘之勢；但欲打破此貴族色彩，固亦不憚犧牲。因此毅然决然，自本年起，更定减價辦法，俾多數民衆，了解利用，知電報並不貴，且亦並非社會較高階級始能出此代價。實際上拍發電報，每通半元以上，一元以內，通逹全國，無遠弗届，較郵遞航空，亦不過多費數角，而迅速程度。則高逾數倍以至數十倍。經此實施，一般對衣電報具特殊觀念者，當可逐漸覺悟，而利用電報之心理，或能普遍增加。電報應供大衆利用，始符創設之本旨；電報須謀盡量推廣，始得事業之發逹。所謂大衆利用，所謂盡量推廣，無非希望平民使用電報者之日見進步，是則求『電報平民化』，减價實爲應有之步驟也。　　或者懷疑··以爲交通當局，實施所謂『電報平民化』，其辦法固未嘗不差，其如社會平民之利用電報，程度幼稚，營業方面，仍無所增進何？斯言也，徒指目前電報營業狀况，似亦未能謂盡非；不過聞交部原意，係從大處着想，係爲民衆着想，母以小善而不爲，母以近利忘遠害，爲一時殘喘之苟延，而不謀事業之進展，斯豈可以語『電報平民化』者耶？　　附正··上期本篇標題爲手民誤排『電話平民化』。手民之誤，似亦具相當理　　由，蓋比較上電話稍能普及，初不意鄙人所談乃電報也於此可見　　電報在一般腦海中，尙未以爲眞正平民化，是平民化確不容緩，因　　特更正，以祈注意。　最近電報業務之改進  寄然　　增加傳遞速度　　校正錯誤電碼　　電報局台，由發報人手中，收得電報，用機拍發，以逹收報人，所負之責任及義務，舉其大者言之，一方固須傅遞迅速，同時亦須傳遞凖確。所謂迅速，所謂凖確，乃是電報業務立足之基礎。　　欲知傳遞之能否迅速，應先明瞭電報傳遞之情形。大抵一通電報之收受，先經收報人員，爲之收費入賬，繼卽經報房登記，交由機上拍發，苟無中間局之接轉，則直接到逹之後，由收報局報房登錄，譯成文字，交由發報人員趕派信差送出，而局台之職務，至此亦告完成。若電報或遇遲延，則其原因，當不止一種，雙方收發電報人員之辦事迅捷與否，爲第一層問題，值機人員之拍發及抄錄能迅捷與否，爲第二層問題，其餘如譯電員之轉譯，報差之投送，能否迅速，亦均關係緊要。不過上述種種，可目爲屬於人的方面，若機械綫路方面，苟或不良，更能影響於電報業務，自不待言矣。　　求報務傳遞之迅捷，關於人的方面，據聞交通部對於各種職務之人員，已加一度　密之考核，現所分配而供職於各局台者，均辦事幹練，收發敏速，殆無疑義；惟報務情形，亦隨各地而不同，通商大埠，營業繁忙，應接不暇，未易周密，苟收發以及值機各部，皆能逹到迅速之目的，而電報由報差投送，經數分鐘或十數分鐘之稽延，亦率易爲局台名譽之累。從前電報投送，往往每一信差出發，所携之報，三四通或五六通不等，雖逐處投送，先後相差之時間甚　，然最後收到者，未免相形見絀。斯雖小節，然亦爲交部顧慮所及，故新定辦法，局台對於來報，隨到隨派報差投送，且將酌量增加報差人數，以彌缺憾；是則關於人的方面，一經整飭，當能於報務迅捷上，更有進步也。　　　我國有綫電報機械，因種種原因，沿用至今，尙多未能改進。欲使傳遞迅捷，機械一層，更見重要，否則機械之能力不足，縱人員工作敏速，亦難得圓滿之結果，因此交部方面，着手先於重要幹線，如滬漢，津滬等，改裝克利特機，及打字電報機，更進一步，以爲推廣。若是人員以及機械，雙方改進，電報迅捷，尤具充分之把握矣。　　尙有關於傳遞電碼凖確一點，須再聲述。查電碼或有錯誤，在電信發逹之國家，亦未能全免。值機人員之拍發及抄錄，苟生錯誤，其責任當然屬諸局台，但照我國電報經過之情形，誤於機上之傳遞者，在電文長者或者有之，若電文短者，可謂絕少。苟經查詢，恒能發現發報人字體潦草或自譯錯誤，各種弊病。譬如阿拉伯字，８或中斷而似５，。或出頭而誤６，此外電碼不熟者，又往往易於脱漏或顚倒，此在發報人方面者，局台祇能希望其繕寫淸楚，同時使收報人員，隨時注意詢明；至關乎機上傳遞，校正偶然之電碼錯誤，則交部固已在各局台，添設正誤校對員，務求錯碼得以充分减少。此種補救辦法，實有利於各界通信，茲舉出之，藉見電報業務，固時時在改進中也。無綫電應用短波的研究（一）  王大椿　　現代文明日進，人類欲彼此交換智識，無論爲文化的，或爲商業的，其必要條件，須有極完美的交通利器，用科學方法，去發明，去產生，方可逹到迅速進步的目的。電信爲交通利器之一，考其進化的程序，亦經歷若干步驟。最初的實騐，將聲浪用電傳遞，利用電氣導體，傳逹至於遠方，這就是有綫電報及電話的成功。從科學的眼光看來，有綫電話的成功，似較電報爲進一步，但是，更有進步的，如雙重通信法（Ｓｕｐｅｒｐｏｓｉｔｉｏｎ），應用搬送電流（ＣａｒｒｉｅｒＣｕｒｒｅｎｔ），把語音振盪時所發生不同様的周波率（Ｆｒｅｏｕｅｎｃｉｅｓ）變成種種不同的信號，傳遞至受話的一端。此種通信法，特别用在架空綫路上，更見功效。　送電流的同波率，雖有時受綫路上固有　减量的影響　　逹　　　　　　　普通仍可增加其高度，至每秒鐘三　周波。　　時至今日，遠距離電信交通的設備，仍猛晋不已，無缐電的發明，並不　導體回路的傳電，祇賴空中高周波的電磁浪（ＥｌｅｃｆｒｏｍａｇｎｏｔｉｃＷａｖｅ），就可以傳信號至遠方。此種無綫電傳信，最初所用的周波率，每秒鐘以一百基羅周波（ｌｏｏＫｉｌｏｃｙｃｌｏｐｅｒＳｅｏｏｎｄｉｏｒｒｏｏＫｃ／ｓ）爲限，更以產生此項電波的電源，其力量有一定的限度，因之使長途電信的交通，所用周波率，都限定在較低的程度丨換言之，大約每秒鐘自十至一百基羅周波，已覺甚爲合式。近年以來，電氣學家幾經研究，高周波的無綫電，已逹實際商用的化境，周波率的增高，可至每秒鐘三千至二萬五千基羅周波（波長自一百至十二公尺），這就是稱之謂『短波』。短波可以克服一切無綫電回路內的困難，故其功效，非特增加電信交通上的用途，卽較之長波可以减少設備上的費用。　　無綫電的各級周波率丨自每秒鐘十其羅周波，至每秒鐘二萬五千基羅周波限度內丨吾人如欲定其電波的名稱，可别爲三種··（一）長波（ＩｏｎｇＷａｖｅ），（二）中波（ＭｅｄｉｕｍＷａｖｅ），（ｓｈｏｒｔＷａｖｅ）這三種電波的分别，雖未有基本的標凖，可以指明，但是，當周波率變動時，電波的性質，每有顯着的變化，因之各種無綫電機，其使用何種電波，須視其性質若何，擇其較爲妥善者，方可使用。無綫電眞空管小史（下）  源　　一九一三年，馬斯南氏發明三極眞空管，可以用作任何高週率交流電之發電機。自此發明後，大電力之眞空管。遂成爲研究之目的。但以屏極緊封於眞空管內，其所發熱量，除放射外，無法消散，故最大電力之眞空管。亦不過數百華特。　　大戰之後，廣播無綫電事業發展，至爲迅速，收音機件，改良極多。一九一九年，奥世章氏，發明超外差式（Ｓｕｐｅｒｈｅｔｒｏｄｙｎｅ）收音機，李斯（ＣＷＲｉｃｅ）及赫史丁（Ｈａｚｅｌｔｉｎｅ）等，先後發表用中和綫路阻止高周率擴大器內之振動，此項發展，於高週率擴大器之穩定及選擇性，頗多改進。　　一九一九年，史脱開（Ｓｃｈｏｔｔｋｙ）主張三極眞空管內，再加一柵極，用以隔離屏極與原有柵極，使內部電容量减低，用作高週率擴大器時，不致發生振動。其後赫而Ｈｕｌｌ及威廉兩氏，Ｗｉｌｌｉａｍｓ卽根據史脱開之原理，加以研究改良，於一九二八年，製成現在市上所流行之四極眞空管。　　廣播事業發逹，裝用收音機者日衆，惟使用收音機者，必須有蓄電池一付，以備燈絲之用。此項蓄電池，價格旣高，充電設備，更爲昂貴，是以使用乾電池之眞空管，需要迫切。歐戰將終，美國西電公司，製造收音眞空管，僅需燈絲電流○二五安培。其後新製眞空管，費電更省，燈絲電流僅○，○六安培。　　節省電力之眞空管，旣經發明，於是收音機電力部分，可以全用乾電池，母需再用蓄電池。但乾電池之應用，吾人仍未滿意；蓋倘一收音機用數個眞空管者，乾電池使用頗費，甚不經濟，於是用城市交流電之眞空管，應時而興。此項眞空管，最初係用整流器，將交流電變成直流，供給眞空管之屏極。其後復用變壓器，將交流電降成低壓，以之燃燒燈絲。燈絲之旁，置一易於發射電子之金屬，稱爲陰極。Ｃａｔｈｏｄｅ燈絲燃燒所發生之熱量，卽用以使此陰極發熱者。至一九二八年，使用此項交流電眞空管之收音機，已佔全世界所有收音機總數百分之八十九。　　當一九一五年，遠越大西洋之無綫電話通話試騐，用許多眞空管並列相接，使生極大電力之振動。此項計劃，殊不　濟，惟當時因屏極置於管內，熱量消散不易，最大電力之眞空管，不過千華特或二千華特。霍司克波（Ｈｏｕｓｅｋｏｅｐｅｒ）遂發明一方法，將屏極銅片，封入玻璃之內，使成管將，卽爲眞空管之最外部份。如此可用冷水或油冷方法，吸收屏極所生之熱量。此方法發明後，眞空管之最大電力，可增加至五十萬華特。图未做電信談  灜頡民　　（一）華盛頓威勒大飯店之經　　於華盛頓政客要人之忙碌，不　　　　　　　　　　　其飯店中之　　　　　　理髮椅旁，裝置可以移動之電話一具，於是忙碌之華盛頓人士，在理髮時亦隨時辦公云。　　（二）巴西之巴蘭納地方，有一鳥克蘭人，發生怪疾，其耳不須無綫電收音機，卽能就得無綫電廣播之聲浪，特向醫官聲稱，彼因兩耳對於無綫電廣播聲浪，兼收併蓄，致使其澈夜不能安眠，請求將其兩耳割去，或設法使能隨時關閉云。無綫電之進步，一日千里，最近更有五極眞空管之發明，並已通行各國，數年之後，預料將有更大發明也。電報業務上又一新設施  季淸　　宣示局臺收報員姓名各處電報局與無綫電臺收發處的收報人員，對於發寄電報，或來詢問電報事務的人，一定要態度謙和，和應答周詳，曾經交通部屢次通令，切實遵辦。倘使有不聽這命令，而對人不客氣的，當然要按照章程，予以嚴厲的懲罰。交通部屢次通令告誡，還認爲不够，最近並且令飭各電報局的無綫電臺，把收報人員的姓名，寫在木牌上，懸掛收發處窗口，使大家都可以知道。牠的用意，想必是左列兩種··　　（一）收報員姓名宣佈以後，倘使他待人傲慢，對方就可記得他的姓名，報告電報局或無綫電臺的主管人員，要求加以　罰。　　（二）　　　報的人員，知道了自己姓名，宣佈在外，當然要十分留神，好好辦事。於是乎暴燥的脾氣，一定不會發作，温和的態度，自然而然的表現出來了。答妙相  電信記者　　交通部近來對於交通事業，確實是整頓改良，不遺餘力。這次命令電報局無綫電臺宣佈收報人員的姓名，雖然看起來是一件極小的事情，然而一方面增進中外發報人士的好感，一方面减少辦事的種種阻礙，不能不説牠是一件觀察嚴密，充滿意義的措施。　　交通部有興　　省長　電話之　，此事已見報載。近　海上　報，有　相君所撰「平津電話綫須架設乎」一文，謂平津間早已十餘年前通話，何以又　架綫？此實與眞相頗有不符。聞交部計畫，將貫通九省，造成爲一電話幹綫綱，平津原有話綫，因此電話網之完成，故亦包括在內，以得聯絡。外界不察謂爲「架設」，易滋誤會，　實際上並無架設之必要也。又原文所引；有「平津間支綫」句，斯段綫路，實幹而非支，應附帶更正。海外無綫電訉美國無綫電公司之新發展  頡　　美國無綫電公司對於「多工無缐電報」及「傳眞無綫電報」，經悠久之研究業已獲得成功。據該公司總理沙諾夫聲稱··「多工無綫電報」將於本年六月一日開放營業。此種多工電報，係利用一種極靈敏之整流器，同時在一個電波上，交錯傳出三張不同之電報，收報站分别將此三種莫氏電碼收下。每一電路，每一分鐘，可拍發六十字（Ｗｏｒｄｓ）。換言之··卽每一個電波，每一分鐘，有一百八十字之容量。「傳眞無綫電報」，係利用一種不及五米長度之超短波，其傳播之距離，爲五十英里，性質與宇宙之光波相似，可集中亦可反射，不受任何天空之干擾。紐約，菲列德菲亞等處間，將於年內成立此種新式電路，以低廉之報費，傳播高速度之傳眞電報。此種報價，將不依字數計算，而依方寸，或字模之大小計算云。英國無缐電話發展狀况  芳　　一九三三年份，英國與各殖民地間無綫電話通信，頗有重要之發展。其最著者爲英印直逹電路，該路業務，係於上年五月一日開放，其在英國之一端，由郵政總局所辖之Ｒｕｇｂｙ及Ｂａｌｄｏｃｋ二處收發報台接轉。印度方面之收發電機，則設於Ｐｏｏｎａ附近，由印度無綫電報公司與印度郵電總局合併經營。印方通話地點，目前祇限於孟買喀爾克他等五處。將來業務發逹，再行擴充。至其他城市，與英國通話之範圍，則於該路到逹倫敦國際交換室後，可接轉至歐美各處云。　　英國與埃及間無綫電話通信，係於一九三十年間開辦。上年四月，該路業務復經陸綫擴展至巴來斯坦各處城市；並可與歐洲大陸各無綫電路聯絡通話。其在埃京開羅一端之機件，現正加以改良，改裝馬可尼公司最新式之機件，以利通信。此外英國與南非洲間之無綫電路，亦經設法擴充，目前南北Ｒｈｏｄｅｓｉａ所屬各重要城市，均可與本國聯絡通話云。　巴西用無綫電改善警務  敦　　巴西聯邦政府，新近爲改進警務起見，組織一種無缐電業務，用以聯絡巴西都會ＲｉｏｄｅＪａｎｅｉｒｏ警務總署，各省中區及兩輪自行車巡警隊。ＲｉｏｄｅＪａｎｅｉｒ海警局不設立電台，以與停泊港內或行駛海中之船隻相聯絡。　　ＲｉｏｄｅＪａｎｅｉｒｏ警務中區之電台，計有馬可尼中波及短波發射機及收受機各兩部。該發射機，用以通報通話均可，其短波者復可用作廣播。廣播業務中，有所謂警務時間者，每日在此時間內，對大衆報告尋獲或遺失之人物，交易須知，新章規定等。廣播範圍超出該聯邦全部境界，而遠及隣國。其短波電台之發射能力，隨時足供巴西與多數國家之聯絡。在試騐之際，且曾與英國及挪威交換電報。　　查該短波警務通信系之收發報機，除警務中區一部外，尙有七部計ＲｉｏｄｅＪａｎｅｉｒｏ海警局一部，外地四部，警用快艇兩部。巡警隊方面，其使用之兩輪摩托車之設有無線電機者亦屬不少。半月消息社友厲行郵電合設　　交部前爲便利民衆通訊起見，特令各通商大埠上海，南就等四十七處郵電兩局實行合設，其餘各處先從江蘇，浙江，河北三省試辦。現聞交部以蘇，浙，冀三省試辦結果甚佳，故已通令其餘各省之郵電局積極籌備合設，定七月一日起開實行。嗣後民衆發電，寄信，通話，可赴就近之郵局或電局發寄，無須分赴電局，郵局，或話局發寄，通訊之便利當可與歐美各國無異云。航行安全電報規則　　交通部爲增進航空機及船舶航行中之安全起見，特設航行安全電報一種，其價目照尋常電報收費，惟特别提前在各種電報之先傳遞，俾可異常迅速，此項電報之電文，祇准叙述下列各項··　　（一）關於警告航空機或船舶注意航行危險事項（二）關於航空機或船舶遇險請求援救事項（三）關於航空機起航前請求報告氣象，報告起航時刻，通知航空站凖備航機降落，及船機或船舶航行安全之其他緊要事項　　上述第一二兩項之電報特准免費，詳細章程可向當地電局或本社索閲。各利用華文打字機抄譯來報　　繁忙電局之來報，大都用高速度之韋斯登機收下印有電報符號之紙條，再交打字員按照纸條上符號抄出電碼，如係華文明碼，然後由譯電員譯成文字，交差投送。此項抄打及譯電手續，在報務繁忙時，難免有所稽延。現聞交部爲良起見，已購置華文打字機數部，將字盤按照電碼次序重加整理，盤前原有之鉛印華字表，則改爲電碼表，以便打字員按照紙條上符號，找尋表上之電碼，打下時，適印出相當之文字。此項打字機採用後，有以下四得··（一）打字機自動譯電，省去人工譯電手續。（二）抄打速率增加一倍，因現在用英文或數碼打字機抄打，每字須打四個數碼，卽按打四下，如用華文打字機則每字祇須按打一下。（三）華洋文來報分工抄打，不致積壓，卽减少　　之稽延時間。（四）華文明碼來報抄成文字投送，旣形簡潔整齊，又極淸晰美觀。聞交部已將此項打字機先行發交南京電報局試用，如試用成績美滿，各電局均將採用云，</p>

發狂的吧；但丁巴利先生終日地寛思着，只是在輕輕的嘆息與憂愁的傷心的微笑裏表現出他的情感。　　昨天旣然吃得那麽好，他覺得今天的飯食應當比平日更節省一些是他的責任了。約在傍晚八點鐘左右，在他以前非常讚賞的空氣作過一番冥想的散步之後，他走進一家店舖裏去，在那里他　買了他的最節省的食物。在　臺後的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　是他的　切的　　。</p>

<h3 id="e1">League of Nations Advisory Committee Statement: Firmly Upholding the Principle of Non-Recognition of the Puppet Regime; Gu's Efforts Outside the Meeting Aim to Increase Strength; Maintaining Ordinary Postal Services in "Manchukuo" as the Main Goal; Chairman Commences Drafting Report; Technical Cooperation Committee Scheduled to Meet Tomorrow <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese problem convened a meeting that lasted for a short time. It unequivocally declared that it would not deviate from the policy of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." After discussing the British memorandum on postal issues, the committee stated that it would maintain ordinary postal relations with "Manchukuo." Dutch representative Maurits held was elected as the chairman of the committee and instructed to draft a report on this issue, to be submitted at the meeting on Wednesday. At that time, China's views on the "Manchukuo" opium license issue will also be discussed. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The issue discussed by the League of Nations Far East Affairs Advisory Committee today was whether the establishment of regular airmail service between Europe and the West and the puppet Manchukuo could be regarded as de facto recognition of the puppet Manchukuo. The committee concluded that the establishment of such airmail is a purely administrative procedure and should not be regarded as de facto recognition of any country. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Incident convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. First, it unequivocally stated that the scope of the committee's discussions would not violate the principle of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Some argued that international transportation and communication matters are technical issues and should be discussed together with the postal issue. No matter what the outcome, it would not conflict with the principle of non-recognition. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo strongly opposed this argument. Representative Koo stated that if such a broad interpretation were made, it would be tantamount to placing the League of Nations in a position of abandoning the principle of non-recognition. Mr. Koo has been extremely busy meeting with League of Nations officials and representatives of various countries on the Advisory Committee in recent days, determined to prevent some members from attempting to expand the original scope of discussion. It is believed here that China's position is very difficult because it is not a member of the Advisory Committee. The issue of postal services between Britain and Manchukuo will be discussed at the Advisory Committee meeting on Wednesday. (World Telegraph Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A responsible official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Incident meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, discussing the British proposal regarding postal relations between China and the puppet state of Manchukuo. The British memorandum is by no means a discussion of the postal issue, but rather the issue of European mail passing through the puppet Manchukuo. Because European mail passes through that area, a common method must be agreed upon regarding postal accounting procedures. As for Britain's non-recognition of the puppet state and the Universal Postal Convention's non-recognition of the puppet state, they have not changed. The attitude of Britain in presenting this memorandum is also completely to avoid the suspicion of recognizing the puppet state, and to seek a unified approach to the meeting. In short, the British memorandum is seeking a way to not recognize the puppet postal service. This is what the people of the country should understand. The committee has now decided to draft a report and continue the meeting on the 16th to discuss and decide. The Chinese Technical Committee was originally scheduled to meet on the 14th, but due to time constraints, it has been changed to the 17th. Our country's representative is still Wellington Koo.</p>
<p>Since Japan is acting like a fox burying and digging up its prey, issuing its so-called statement opposing technical cooperation, and recklessly criticizing technical cooperation, our country should make a solemn statement when the Technical Cooperation Committee meets, so that the international community can fully understand Japan's ambition and barbarity. Therefore, it has been telegraphed to Representative Koo to announce to the representatives of various countries with a solemn attitude and a sincere speech at the meeting. It is expected that Mr. Koo's reputation in the diplomatic world will surely win the unanimous sympathy of various countries. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chinese Delegation Sends Letter to the League of Nations, Vehemently Condemning the Opium Disaster in the Northeast; Puppet Licenses Have Absolutely No Responsibility; Suggests Management by Consuls of Various Countries <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation's official letter to the League of Nations regarding the opium issue in "Manchukuo," sent from Paris on May 1st, was published here. It stated that the Chinese government should not accept the opium import licenses issued by the puppet Manchukuo, because the puppet Manchukuo has not been recognized and is an unrecognized entity. The issued licenses have absolutely no responsibility. The Chinese government is particularly concerned about the increasingly severe harm caused by the official sale of opium for profit and the approval of continued opium shipments to Manchuria, which will only increase the already encroaching smoking problem. The surplus opium can only be illegally sold in China south of the Great Wall. The purpose of this move is obviously to obtain funds to establish a new official sale, and it seems to contain a deeper intention: to spread opium and weaken the spirit and morality of the Chinese people. At the end of the letter, Chinese Ambassador to France Wellington Koo suggested that a revised management system of issuing licenses by consular representatives in Manchuria would be more effective and would not undermine the principle of non-recognition.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Health Committee convened a meeting to discuss the report on China's cooperation with international organizations in sanitary facilities.

Yin, Tao, and others are scheduled to return to Beiping in three or four days. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng, Matsui, Yin Tong, and Iga met this morning to discuss war zone issues in detail. The matters discussed were: (1) All Japanese personnel entering and leaving the war zone must follow the specific procedures stipulated to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides. (2) Crackdown on ronin entering and leaving the war zone. (3) Withdrawal of puppet police from the war zone and various diplomatic matters related to the war zone. The negotiations have now ended, but the issue of the withdrawal of puppet police from Nantianmen has not yet been resolved. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

Yin Tong took a special train this afternoon to Beidaihe Seaside for a vacation. Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and Shibayama returned to Beiping and Tianjin from Yuguan. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft practice dropping bombs in Malan Gorge, Xinglong County, from time to time. Because we cannot interfere in the Xinglong area, the farmers are very frightened. The puppet police at Nantianmen previously agreed to withdraw to outside Gubeikou, but they demanded 10,000 yuan from us for repair costs, which we refused. They have not yet withdrawn. Yin Rugeng also mentioned this matter when he met with Shibayama in Tianjin. Because the Japanese side insisted on demanding this 10,000 yuan, the negotiations are still inconclusive. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After more than 200 soldiers from the Sugihara Brigade of the Japanese Army arrived in Jixian, the Jizhoumi Commissioner's Office inquired about the truth from the Jixian County Magistrate by telephone this morning. The reply stated that this unit of the Japanese army had no intention of stationing in Jixian for a long time. A few days ago, a unit of the Japanese army from Malan Gorge passed through Xiaying, Jixian County, and originally planned to go to Huangyaguan near Gubeikou to garrison. After our negotiations, they have agreed to return to Xinglong County. On the 14th, this unit of the Japanese army entered Jixian County and was scheduled to leave completely on the 15th. According to relevant sources, the Jixian telephone call received tonight stated that this unit of the Japanese army was still in Jixian County as of the afternoon of the 15th. Recently, Japanese aircraft in the Rehe area have been flying over Xinglong County for exercises, which is causing great panic among the people. Recently, more than 100 Japanese cavalrymen were found near Shunyi, scouting in various suburbs of the city. The garrison was transferred from Xinglong County. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Li Haoming, Magistrate of Jixian County, telegraphed to the province, reporting that the Japanese army entering the county belonged to the Sugihara Brigade of the 7th Division of the Kwantung Army, with two companies and more than 240 people, led by a major. All hotels and public institutions were occupied, and there was an intention to stay for a long time. On the 14th, a lieutenant captain of the army came to the county and requested to vacate a larger house for a concentrated garrison. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army forcibly occupied land in Balitai, Tianjin, and started earth-filling negotiations. Because the protest letter from our municipal government was sent ten days ago and has not been answered, the negotiations seem to have stalled. The municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau on the 15th to investigate the lease contract for Guangrentang and plans to submit a written protest again. The number of workers building the Balitai construction site has increased to more than 150 in recent days. The earth-filling project has been completed for more than 100 acres. Ignorant workers, instigated by the Japanese, are very hostile to Chinese people passing through the site, so many people have been beaten for no reason. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Kang-Tibetan border has been peaceful for a long time.

According to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Liu Wenhui's telegram was an old article from two months ago. Huang Musong, the special envoy for mourning the Dalai Lama, telegraphed to Beijing on the 14th, announcing his safe arrival in Kangding, without mentioning any changes in Kang-Tibetan situation.

<h3 id="e15">On the Significance of the Balkan States' Grouping <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to a Rome dispatch from the National News Agency on the 13th, the Balkan countries are currently planning to establish a second Balkan Pact, so that Bulgaria, which did not join the previous one, can join. If this move succeeds, the grouping of the Balkan countries will be completed. At the same time, their position on the international stage will inevitably become more important. Now, based on the situation of the Balkan countries, let us discuss the significance of this.</p>
<p>Today, there are six countries that can be called Balkan states: (1) Romania, (2) Yugoslavia, (3) Greece, (4) Turkey, (5) Bulgaria, and (6) Albania. Among these six countries, Romania and Yugoslavia are originally countries within the Little Entente group. Bulgaria was an ally of Germany and Austria during the European War. After the war, it suffered heavy losses in land cession and indemnity to Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Its situation was as tragic as that of Germany and Austria after the war. Therefore, its desire lies in the revision of the peace treaty. Ideologically, it is quite close to Mussolini, who advocates reorganizing the League of Nations. Albania has, in fact, become a protectorate of Italy and a base for Italy's invasion of the Balkan Peninsula. As for Greece and Turkey, they were originally sworn enemies. However, since the two sides signed a non-aggression treaty last winter and after the recent establishment of the Balkan Pact, not only have previous grudges been completely abandoned, but their friendship has even surpassed the ordinary. From this perspective, the Balkan countries have gradually entered the orbit of the Little Entente group. Except for Albania, which is small and poor, Italy has few allies in the Balkan Peninsula. Even the direction of Bulgaria's inclination is difficult to predict. Judging from the current situation, Bulgaria is in a surrounded position, and its inability to establish geographical contact with Italy is very obvious. Firstly, Yugoslavia and Romania have spared no effort to woo it. Therefore, Bulgaria's joining the Balkan group is expected. As a result, Italy's future development in the Balkan Peninsula will be greatly hindered.</p>
<p>However, the unity of the Balkan countries is not only to counter Italy but also to counter Germany. Although the brewing of this movement has been going on for a long time, the reason why it can be realized urgently is that Hitler's eastward policy has contributed to it. However, after the agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary was established, the goal of this group turned to dealing with Italy. The land of the Little Entente countries all originated from the division of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Therefore, their policy is unfavorable to the resurgence of Austria-Hungary and favorable to the isolation of Austria-Hungary. Therefore, whether it is the merger of Germany and Austria or the alliance of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, all are feared by them, believing that any of these is enough to shake the balance of power in Central Europe, endanger the security of the Balkan Peninsula, and strengthen the revisionist movement of the defeated countries. Therefore, in essence, the grouping of the Balkan countries today is an expansion of the Little Entente group, which is not conducive to Germany or the advancement of Italian power. The only country that can echo and support it diplomatically is France in Western Europe. If Bulgaria can join, it will be a major victory for French diplomacy. Because with such a group, France can usually use the majority in the League of Nations to restrain Germany and Italy, and in wartime, it can geographically encircle Germany and Italy. The situation is very clear.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Bolivia-Paraguay Situation Tense Again; League of Nations Mediation Shows Inability; Discussion of Gran Chaco Dispute Suddenly Postponed; France and Germany Each Employing Tactics in the Saar Issue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Foreign Minister of Bolivia telegraphed the League of Nations from La Paz today, stating that he had reliably learned that Paraguay, on the pretext that Bolivian aircraft bombed Gran Chaco positions, ordered Bolivian prisoners to draw lots to determine who should be shot. It was also learned that among the captured Bolivians were senior military officers, that food rations for prisoners had been reduced, and that they were not allowed to write letters to their families. If these uncivilized crimes are confirmed by officials, Bolivian aircraft will definitely bomb the capital of Paraguay. The League of Nations Council, which was originally scheduled to hold an open meeting this morning to discuss the Gran Chaco dispute, suddenly postponed it to Thursday. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou is scheduled to meet tomorrow with the Italian representative Aole Yasi, chairman of the special committee on the Saar issue of the League of Nations Council, to discuss the Saar issue. The special committee has listened to the statements of Knox, chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, and most other members, and has also had lengthy discussions on the freedom of the plebiscite and the safety of the people after the vote. A provisional report has been drafted, the content of which only discusses the technical issues of the plebiscite. This report will be sent to the governments of the member states tomorrow. Various Jewish organizations in the Saar region have sent various documents to the representatives of the member states of the League of Nations Council, asking them to pay attention to the fate of the Jewish minority in the Saar region and requesting the League of Nations to take various measures to protect the Jews after the plebiscite. It was recently rumored in the Saar region that the "German Front" in the area had submitted a petition to the League of Nations, stating that the above news was absurd. The "German Front" is justified and would not harm its position with violence. Moreover, the residents of the Saar have endured the current system for fifteen years. Now that the date of deciding their fate is only a few months away, how can they not be patient? (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Saint Brance, a famous French jurist, expressed his opinion today, saying that if it is desired to prevent oppression from any party during the Saar region's referendum next year, the simplest method of guaranteeing it is to organize an international police force. Saint Brance also said that there are many unemployed or retired soldiers and police in various countries of the world. If a special police force is organized, directly under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations, it is easy to do. Furthermore, the idea of international police has long been noticed by various countries, but it has never been implemented. If this opportunity is used to test its effectiveness, it is an opportunity not to be missed. (National News dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun received a telegram from its Qiqihar correspondent today, stating that Japanese Captain Sakurai led a small squad of soldiers on a ship to Daheihe. On Sunday morning, about four miles west of the confluence of the Songhua River and the Heilongjiang River, they were bombarded by Soviet Russian artillery. One Japanese officer was seriously injured, and one sailor each was killed and injured.

<p>(Tokyo) The third intermediate meeting of the Sino-Eastern Railway negotiations was held at the official residence of the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. The puppet Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi, and the Russian representative, Kanovsky, attended the meeting to discuss the settlement plan proposed by both the Russian and puppet sides. However, the two sides' claims on the accompanying issues are far apart. The content of these accompanying issues is secret and cannot be known, and it is expected to have a major political relationship and is a major reason for the stagnation of the negotiations. Moreover, the attachments proposed by the Russian side this time are even tougher than at the beginning of the negotiations. Therefore, the Army Ministry believes that the Russian side has no sincerity in abandoning the Sino-Eastern Railway and is only perfunctorily dealing with Japan and the puppet regime. It does not expect anything from the future of the negotiations. (Hualian dispatch on the 15th)</p>

Because the 100 puppet troops accompanying them were not disarmed by the Volunteer Army, they had agreed with the Volunteer Army in advance that they would defect and respond to the Volunteer Army as soon as they saw the Volunteer Army coming to attack.

<p>(Dalian) Yesterday, three police officers, including Uryu, a special agent of the Dalian Japanese Police Station, escorted a Japanese resident back here from Harbin. According to the Japanese side, a foreign consulate in Dalian organized an international spy ring.

He will probably be appointed as Ambassador to London. As for Vice Foreign Minister Sokolnikov, who resigned at the same time as Karakhan, he will probably be appointed as Ambassador to Paris, because the current Ambassador to Paris, Dovgalevsky, intends to resign due to illness.

<p>(London) The Far East Affairs Committee of the House of Commons passed a resolution today, advocating that the British Malaya Peninsula and Singapore should promptly implement a quota system for the import of Japanese cotton fabrics. The content of the resolution briefly states that "If the British government does not adopt a policy of limiting the quantity of imports, then the results of future negotiations between the British and Japanese governments will not be more favorable than negotiations between the business communities of the two countries." The Far East Affairs Committee, while vigorously advocating the signing of an agreement with Japan to settle the various problems caused by Japanese commodity competition, also firmly believes that the current situation is urgent and a policy of limiting import quantities should be adopted immediately. Future negotiations will not be hindered by this. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir McGovern, the president of the British Imperial Chemical Industries, revealed in an article in the Chemical Industry Report today that the company will send a delegation to Japan this summer to discuss many chemical industry events. He believes that it is not useless for British industry to adopt this method, but if it is not done, the situation will become more acute in the future. The aggressiveness of Japanese industry is particularly enviable. Britain should quickly find a way to place British trade in a competitive position. The British should not be overly arrogant and not learn from the other party's methods. The Japanese, like the British, would rather cooperate than compete. It is up to us British to find ways to promote this sentiment so as to correct the current situation and maintain it. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) An Associated Press correspondent learned today from reliable sources that the International Labor Conference to be held in June this year will criticize Japan's policy of dumping in foreign markets by using low wages. This may cause Japan to withdraw from the International Labor Office. Reports received here indicate that the first to criticize Japanese commercial aggression will be British labor leaders and employer representatives, and representatives from several British colonies will follow suit. It is known that this anti-Japanese movement will lead to the passage of a motion by the conference condemning countries that use low wages and currency devaluation to seize foreign markets, and will cite the International Labor Office's "Japanese Labor Conditions" report to prove that Japanese wages are indeed lower than those of other industrialized countries. An Associated Press correspondent heard that Japan is unwilling to ignore this criticism, and Tokyo will send an important delegation to prove that Japan's encroachment on other countries' markets is due to the devaluation of the Japanese yen, not to low wages.

<p>Rome An agreement aimed at making the economic protocol in the covenant concluded by Italy, Austria, and Hungary on March 17 effective was signed today. The Austrian and Hungarian envoys to Italy signed on behalf of their respective countries, and the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini signed it himself. The agreement stipulates the facilitation of Hungarian wheat exports, the granting of rights to Austrian industrial products, and the granting of rights to Italian tropical products such as citrus fruits. According to the tripartite covenant of March 17, there are three types of agreements: The first agreement is that the leaders of the three countries agreed to conduct the following purposes, that is, the three countries should unite on all issues that have a part of the relationship or common nature with them, and when one of the three countries encounters the need to gather and consult, the three governments should consult each other. The second agreement, concerning the development of economic relations, was stated on May 15 to establish a multilateral agreement. The three governments agreed to form a permanent committee of three experts to monitor the progress of economic relations among the three governments and to formulate specific recommendations to make this relationship develop even greater in the spirit of this agreement. The third agreement is between Austria and Italy, stating that the two governments have resolved to proceed with the development of economic relations between the two countries.

<p>Rome The economic agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary was signed tonight. The first agreement was concluded between Italy and Austria, and its content stipulates the methods for the two countries to allow concessions to each other's export businesses. The second type is the agreement signed by Italy and Hungary, in which Italy agrees to absorb 1 million quintals of Hungarian wheat at a price of 56 lire (Italian currency) per quintal, which is twice as high as the Hungarian domestic market. If Italy needs more in the future, it will continue to purchase 1 million quintals from Hungary at the same price as the first time. According to Hungary's wheat production, approximately 4.2 million quintals need to be sold abroad, but neither Italy nor Austria has the ability to absorb such a quantity. According to this agreement, Italy buys Hungarian wheat at double the price, although the quantity is limited to 2 million quintals, the price paid is equivalent to 4 million quintals, which is of great benefit to the Hungarian economy. Regarding the use of the ports of Trieste and Fiume, Italy will also conclude separate treaties with Austria and Hungary. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital The signing of the economic agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, from the Hungarian point of view, is actually a long-term cooperation between the country's agriculture and the industries of Italy and Austria, and this cooperation is obtained after paying a price. The industries newly emerging in Hungary after the European War, promoted and assisted by the government, will be sacrificed by the signing of the tripartite economic agreement. The recent speech by Hungarian Prime Minister Gombos in the parliament reveals this intention. The Prime Minister said that Hungarian industry cannot be without sacrifice, but the government intends to use this to seek a compromise with the agricultural factions and large landowners. It should be noted that the tripartite agreement can only guarantee the export of wheat to Hungarian agriculture. Currently, there is also some unrest in the agricultural sector, because farmland has been dry recently, and there are concerns that the harvest will be reduced, and agriculture cannot enjoy the benefits of the agreement.

The Premier added that France itself has reduced its armaments, while other countries have expanded their armaments in violation of treaties, so it is not surprising that we insist on security.

People with lofty ideals all feel that the country is broken and the family is destroyed, displaced, and see it with their own eyes and feel heartbroken. It is better to deal with the Japanese, or they may get a chance to survive. If they are willing to be slaves of the Japanese, it is difficult to get a place to die, so those who have been deeply victimized all rise up to make a final desperate fight. Recently, in Jiamusi, Yilan, Tongjiang, Boli, and other counties in Jilin Province, the Japanese arbitrarily ravaged the people's militia by collecting land and guns, resulting in a tragic change. The details of the farmers' united resistance against Japan are recorded as follows: Forcible Collection of People's Land Incited a Tragic Disaster: The Qiangjiatun of Jiamusi, with more than 50,000 mu of land in the whole village, is all fertile, and the main crops are wheat and rice. The Japanese forcibly transferred more than 100 households of Korean farmers to the village and ordered the villagers to hand over the land licenses and forced them to move away immediately. At that time, the same situation occurred in Tulongshan Village, which belongs to Yilan. The old man surnamed Xie, the head of a hundred households in the village, was nearly eighty years old. Because the land was confiscated by the Japanese, he wore the prepared mourning clothes, put them in the prepared coffin, and took opium poison to die. When the family noticed it, it had already become a tragedy. His son, Xie, was distraught, but in order to express his determination to resist Japan and kill the enemy, he first killed the women and children in the family, so that he could fight the enemy to the death without any worries and avoid being harmed by the enemy. It is also tragic. Later, Xie and the head of a hundred households surnamed Luan in the village jointly planned to unite against Japan, declared the general meaning to the whole village, gathered more than 2,000 strong men, and contacted more than 4,000 armed farmers in Qiangjiatun, Jiamusi. At that time, the Japanese side had not yet learned the inside story. Japanese army Captain Yuzuka led more than 30 people to investigate. The death of Izuka reported a few days ago was killed by the local volunteer armed farmers. Xie also cut Izuka's abdomen and took his heart to sacrifice his father. He will also be a martyr. The United Resistance Against Japan by the Victim Farmers: Duan, a villager in Erlongshan Village, Tongjiang County, is a large landlord in the village, who generously contributed money. The villagers all called him Fifth Master Duan. After the September 18th Incident, the leaders of the Volunteer Army mostly lurked in his home. When the Japanese issued an order to collect the people's guns, the Japanese army went to his home to search out more than 200 guns and arrested more than 10 members of his family, charging them with colluding with bandits. More than 100 members of the Duan family were scattered. However, his sons, nephews, and strong men have led the villagers to join the armed farmers in the Fifth District of Boli County and the civil militia leaders of Yilan, such as Xie and Luan, with a total of more than 15,000 people, to resist Japan with their lives. The momentum is huge. Yu Xianzhu, the pseudo-Jilin Provincial Garrison Commander, once sent the pseudo-Second Brigade Commander Li Xisan to lead a team to besiege them, but they were defeated by the civil militia and suffered heavy losses. When the Japanese army heard the news, they sent more than 100 armed vehicles to pursue them. Fortunately, the terrain where the civil militia was located was all mountainous and dangerous, and the Japanese army could hardly succeed. Since the civil militia retreated, the Japanese army has wantonly searched various villages and villages in Tongjiang and Boli counties, and many innocent people have suffered. For example, according to the ten-family joint guarantee method, if a certain family lacks a strong man, it is pointed out that he has joined the Volunteer Army, and his family members are taken away and subjected to extreme punishments, and their houses are burned down. Their behavior is extremely cruel. (Northeast News Agency) Guangdong Province Reinforced National Defense: Generals From All Walks of Life Were Summoned to Return to the Province for a Meeting: Japanese and Taiwanese Ruffians Were Extremely Active in Shantou: According to a correspondent in Shantou, Japan held a cross-strait meeting in Taiwan, summoning consuls from South China to participate, targeting Fujian, Guangdong, and the Southwest. The nature of the meeting was very serious. After the Southwest Political Committee sent out two cold telegrams, party headquarters at all levels responded a lot, and the call for resisting Japan and defending against insults became louder day by day. At the same time, it was also envied by the other side, so the Guangdong provincial authorities convened a national defense conference to consolidate sea and air defenses. Li Yangjing, Yu Hanmou, Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Zhang Da, Li Zhenliang, Huang Yanzhen, Huang Zhiwen, Huang Renhuan, Miao Peinan, Li Hanhun, Deng Longguang, Chen Hanguang, Chen Zhangfu, Chen Zhang, Lin Shiqing, Wang Zanbin, Du Yiqian, and Jiang Xiyuan were all summoned to participate. Those who could not come in person sent chiefs of staff or rear directors to participate. It is said that the discussion items centered on national defense, and the three provinces of Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong will jointly study it. It is said that Fujian Province will also send personnel to Guangdong to participate. It is said that the southwestern provinces have a preliminary unity on strengthening national defense, and the powerful factions in each province have sent representatives to Guangdong to connect with each other. In Shantou, the number of Japanese and Taiwanese ruffians has been increasing day by day. In the past, there were no small boats to ferry passengers and goods when Japanese ships arrived in Shantou. Recently, there have been Japanese goods flooding the market. It is said that they are all sold to Chinese by Taiwanese. With the approval of the public defense association, merchants can dismantle and sell Japanese goods sealed in the past after paying donations. Therefore, new and old Japanese goods on the market cannot be distinguished, and they are allowed to be dumped naturally. Japanese and Taiwanese have set up a Sun Coffee Building in Shantou to lure young people to dance, and there is also the so-called Dongj</p>

<p>Modern Chinese Women: Please See How Japanese Newspapers Mock the Trend of Using Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Described as a Failure of "Women's National Goods Year," according to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the National Government has exhausted its capabilities, utilizing all propaganda organs, to promote national goods. The so-called slogan of "Women's National Goods Year," its hoped-for achievements, have all been reduced to nothing. Why is this? Tracing back to the first month of the year, it is now almost mid-April, and the excess of imports over exports in the first quarter of the previous year was 160 million yuan. Judging by the figures, the situation is self-evident. Namely, imported foreign goods are mostly consumed in the cities, and among them, five or six out of ten are decorative consumables for the modern women's class. Therefore, although they are called upon with the slogan of promoting national goods, the women remain indifferent. No wonder "Women's National Goods Year" has completely failed. In short, no matter how the slogan is promoted, the National Government itself, being an absolute advocate of national essence, should not focus on "promoting national goods that cannot be implemented," but rather first instill the concept of national essence in rural women.</p>
<p>American Fleet to Sail for Yantai and Qingdao Today</p>

Thus, only two American ships will remain in Shanghai, both belonging to the Yangtze Patrol.</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Association Continues Efforts to Ban Opium; Sends Letter Encouraging Vice-Commander Zhang</p>
<p>Sends another Representative to Urge Success. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association believes that in recent years, the harm caused by opium and red pills has been boundless. An investigation into the source of opium and drugs reveals that they mostly come from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, flowing down the Yangtze River through Hankou. To eliminate this, they must start with Wuhan. Therefore, last month, they dispatched representative Huang Jiahuai to Wuhan to inspect the situation and petition Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang of the three provinces' bandit suppression to ban it. Deputy Commander Zhang then discussed the matter with Commander-in-Chief Chiang, who issued an order to ban it. This was reported in a previous issue. It is heard that the Association believes that previous opium bans were initially grand but faded over time, resulting in failure, which is regrettable. This time, the authorities are acting vigorously, and the people should actively urge them to succeed. Therefore, they are sending Executive Committee member Yan Baohang to Wuhan again to continue their efforts, aiming to eliminate the root causes and clear the accumulated poisons. It is heard that Mr. Yan departed from Peiping a few days ago to Wuhan, to continue discussing with Deputy Commander Zhang the steps to insist on rejecting drugs and to investigate the situation after the opium ban. It is expected that after the opium ban in Wuhan, various provinces will follow suit. It is heard that the Association sent a letter to Vice-Commander Zhang, praising his dedication to banning the harm of opium, accepting the proposals for banning opium, assisting Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and implementing the opium ban, encouraging him to adhere to the people's demands and persevere to the end.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Has Not Borrowed Money from Banks</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Municipal Government moved into the city center, it has been actively planning various public buildings in the city. Preparatory committees have been organized for the Municipal Stadium, Library, and Museum to gather the wisdom and resources of all parties to complete these public buildings as soon as possible and make the city center more prosperous. It is rumored that the Municipal Government will borrow two million yuan from banks to build the stadium, museum, and library. A reporter inquired about this matter with the Municipal Government. According to the Municipal Government spokesperson, the Municipal Government is making every effort to plan and realize various public buildings in the city, distinguishing between urgent and gradual implementation. The expenses are all included in the annual budgets, and there is no special borrowing from banks. The rumor is completely inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>After Jinglong Ship Ran Aground, Passengers and Cargo Were Unloaded in Xiamen</p>
<p>Shanghai Office Repeatedly Telegraphed to Inquire About Rescue Situation. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Heng Kang Shipping Company's Jinglong ship ran aground in Xiamen Port, the cargo has been unloaded by the Customs and transferred to the Customs warehouse. Personnel sent from Shanghai have arrived in Xiamen and are handling the aftermath. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Already Unloaded After the Jinglong ship ran aground, it remained stuck on the reef. The cargo of more than 1,300 tons has been unloaded by the Xiamen Customs and transferred to the Customs warehouse. However, the cargo in the forward hold has been soaked in water, resulting in significant losses. The Shanghai company received a telegram from the Xiamen agency stating, "All three telegrams received, will act accordingly. In addition to the cargo already unloaded by the Customs and stored in the warehouse, the aftermath will be handled by the shipowner upon arrival in Xiamen."</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath The manager of the Xiamen Dahua Agency, Mr. Wang, who was sent to Xiamen by the Shanghai company on the 13th of this month, and the Shanghai company staff members Yu Jitang and Sun Maojun, originally planned to take the Taikoo Company's Zhejiang ship, but because the ship was carrying banknotes to Xiamen, passengers were prohibited from boarding, so they changed to the Qiongshan ship to Xiamen, and have now arrived and are handling the aftermath. The Shanghai company telegraphed Xiamen again last night, "After the cargo is unloaded, can the ship float? Please reply in detail."</p>
<p>Lu Wenshao Petitions to Return to Shanghai after Tianjin Levies Fruit Tax</p>
<p>Each Court and Ministry Agreed to Investigate and Stop it.

After Mr. Lu arrived in Beijing, he submitted documents to the Legislative, Supervisory, and Executive Yuan, as well as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting an investigation and stop to the collection, and each court and ministry accepted it and agreed to investigate separately. Mr. Lu thought he was satisfied and left Beijing last night to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Navigation Bureau Ordered Each Shipping Company Yesterday</p>
<p>The Time of Yangtze River Ship Voyages Must Correspond with the Nanxun Railway</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is now for the convenience of traffic from various places along the Yangtze River to Jiangxi Province, and yesterday issued a circular to the Shanghai Navigation Bureau and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, asking each shipping company, whose ships on the Yangtze River line, must correspond with the Nanxun Railway operation time. The original order said: Checking the Yangtze River ship, the Nanxun Railway, its arrival and departure time, can not just correspond. For the convenience of passengers and the business of each ship, it is necessary to adjust the arrival and departure times of the upstream and downstream ports and Shanghai and Hankou. Make sure the arrival of the ship and the departure of the train, and the arrival of the train and the departure of the ship, are not too delayed, or too hasty, so that passengers can save time and have all kinds of convenience, and the shipping business can also be developed. In addition to ordering the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to comply, the appropriate action is to order the Bureau to inform the shipping companies operating on the Yangtze River to properly plan the contact method to facilitate transportation. After the Navigation Bureau received the order, it immediately notified the Sanbei Shipping Company, Ning Shao Shipping Company and other companies in this city that are dedicated to the Yangtze River line, ordering them to know and comply.</p>

<p>Shantou Donation Bureau Detains Bean Cakes; Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Telegraphed to Request Release</p>
<p>Gu Qingyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, telegraphed various agencies and organizations in Guangzhou and Shantou regarding the detention of bean cakes by the Shantou Donation Bureau (details omitted). I checked that bean cakes and peanut cakes are purely indigenous products of our country and are the only fertilizers for farmers. In the past, they were all taken from the eastern provinces. Since September 18th, factories in various parts of the country have been established one after another. In Jiangsu Province alone, there are Shanghai Dayouyu, Changde, Changji, Suifeng, Dadexin, Lide, Wuxi Hengde, Runfeng, Changzhou Xiefeng, Kunshan Housheng, and other factories, totaling ten. There are also five factories in Hankou, with huge production, sold throughout the country, especially in Guangzhou and Shantou, which are the most prosperous, and all are unhindered. Now, according to the Guangzhou Miscellaneous Grain Association, this time the bean cakes transported by the Zhongxing ship, received by Shenghexing, include 2,000 pieces of Suifeng factory's Suifeng stamped cakes, 1,000 pieces of Hengde factory's Hengde stamped cakes, 2,000 pieces of Dayou factory's Daji stamped cakes. Also received by Yu'anxiang, there are 2,200 pieces of Changji factory's Changji stamped cakes, 2,500 pieces of Dayou factory's Daji stamped cakes, 139 bags of peanut cakes, and received by Guangchengxing, there are 1,000 pieces of Dayou factory's Daji stamped cakes. Also received by Yongtongxing, there are 1,000 pieces of Dayou factory's Daji stamped cakes, and received by Guangrongxing, there are 1,000 pieces of Dayou factory's Daji stamped cakes, totaling 18,200 pieces. When the ship arrived in Guangdong, the Donation Bureau mistakenly recognized them as products from the eastern provinces and detained them all, levying heavy taxes. At the same time, the above-mentioned inland oil factories also stated that the bean cakes and peanut cakes currently sold to Shantou were suddenly mistakenly recognized by the local Donation Bureau as goods from the eastern provinces, forcing them to pay heavy taxes, etc., requesting a transfer telegram to prove their release. I believe that our country has recently been affected by the world's economic downturn and the dumping of foreign goods. Farmers and merchants are in extreme difficulties. The way to save them is to promote production on the one hand, and to develop sales on the other. After September 18th, the government resolutely implemented a blockade policy against the eastern provinces, levying heavy taxes on all goods imported from the eastern provinces, in order to maintain domestic production. The purpose is very clear. Recently, the announcement by the Guangdong Provincial Finance Commissioner's Office stated that if they are not soil-made cakes from the eastern provinces, they are not subject to taxation, which shows the intention to rescue farmers and merchants and revive the decline. The above-mentioned cakes produced by the inland factories are definitely not goods from the eastern provinces. The raw materials come from the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. In recent years, bean production has been exceptionally abundant, with huge surpluses and low prices. Therefore, the raw materials for cake production in inland factories are all taken from these five provinces. As for the import of bean materials from the eastern provinces, heavy taxes have been levied, as mentioned above. If we abandon the low-priced bean materials from the five provinces and go to the eastern provinces, the cost will be almost double. Merchants' business is not for profit, who would be willing to avoid the light and take the heavy? If it is said that the inland factory cake trademarks are also ordered from the eastern provinces, then the repeated transportation, both paying heavy taxes and needing freight and all expenses, I ask, who would be willing to increase the burden and put themselves in a loss? This kind of speculation is definitely not possible, and is it allowed by reason? In short, the raw materials for inland factory cakes are completely collected from the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and their products are all self-made. The facts are clear, and you are welcome to send staff to conduct an on-site investigation. Now the cakes produced by the various inland factories shipped to Guangzhou and Shantou by the Zhongxing ship are actually mistaken by the Donation Bureau as products from the east, and are detained for taxation. The Association regards this as the utmost importance, and urgently reports it. I urge you to quickly order the Donation Bureau to release all cakes transported by various ships, except those imported from the eastern provinces, in order to maintain domestic products and embody the government's intention to revive the rural areas. Furthermore, the trademarks of all cakes from the above-mentioned inland factories will be collected by our Association and submitted for filing to facilitate identification, and the Shanghai Miscellaneous Sugar and Oil Cake Industry Association Chairman Committee Gu Yi bows. It is cold.</p>

She showed the reporter her white silk report to the Support Association. However, as it concerns military secrets, it will not be published for the time being.</p>
<p>Navigation Bureau and Shipping Association Issued a Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>Crew Members Must Be Certified by a Deadline, Otherwise Their Duties Will Be Suspended. After the Ministry of Communications implemented the crew certification, the Shipping Association and the Navigation Bureau, after receiving the ministry's order, sent letters to various shipping companies yesterday to comply. The original text said, "Respectfully, according to the Ministry of Communications' Order No. 2300, the deadline for crew certification is six months, which is about to expire. All crew members who have applied to the ministry for certification and should be tested have been notified separately. It is found that some who should have been tested in the first session have not come for the test until the third session, often delaying with excuses, which is very wrong. Now the fourth session of crew testing is about to be held, and all crew members who should be tested, whether for retakes or initial tests, must come for the test in the fourth session. If they still fail to attend this time, their duties will be suspended. In addition to separate orders, the appropriate action is to order the Association to inform the shipping companies to comply with this order.

<p>Anglo-American Old Factory Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Anglo-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong suddenly closed its old factory on the 12th of this month without any reason. Upon hearing the news, all the workers were extremely indignant. The labor union guided the workers to wait quietly for orders from the party and government departments, so the order was quite strict. The children's school of the labor union also continued to have classes as usual, and everything was very calm. In addition to holding regular representative meetings to discuss specific measures, the workers also gathered all the propagandists last night to report on the factory's conspiracy and ordered them to promote and comfort the workers, so as to clarify the truth and strictly maintain order. According to the person in charge of the labor union, the company's sudden closure of the factory this time is unreasonable, and the various circles have their own public opinions, which need not be said by the union. However, the unemployment of thousands of workers is a major event. The union can only wait quietly for the party and government agencies to resolve it according to law.</p>

In addition to ordering Chen Minghan and others to dissolve and report, it also orders all travel industries and inns under its jurisdiction to join the Travel Industry Association." "In accordance with this, in addition to ordering Chen Minghan and others to dissolve the association within a time limit, it is appropriate to order the Association to know and inform."</p>

<p>Chinese Chemical Industry Society Hosts Samsung Mosquito Coil Distributors</p>
<p>Samsung mosquito coils produced by the Chinese Chemical Industry Society are sold throughout the country, and they can be said to be unique. In order to promote production and sales cooperation, the Society specially hosted various distributors at the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association on Xizang Road yesterday. More than 400 representatives of the tobacco industry attended. During the banquet, the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves. A huge painting was drawn in front of the main entrance of the venue. The picture shows a soldier raising a gun to declare war on mosquitoes, implying resistance to foreign goods, which is alert and interesting. Next to it is a colorful pavilion, inside which a woman is depicted sleeping, burning a plate of Samsung mosquito coils, in a leisurely and comfortable posture. Observers are crowded. Dozens of giant Samsung mosquito coil boxes with a diameter of three feet are placed along the stairs, and extra-large mosquito coils are hung, which can attract the attention of pedestrians. Several couplets are hung in front of the main entrance, the text reads, "After more than ten years of struggle and improvement, can be able to crush imported goods, holding the bull's ear of domestic products, and being welcomed by hundreds of millions of people, and promoting industrial authority." There are many slogans in the venue, such as "Promoting domestic goods requires production and sales to work together," "Eliminating mosquitoes is an important task of the new life movement," "A mosquito can lay four to five hundred eggs each time, and they become larvae within twenty-four hours" "A mosquito can produce up to five hundred trillion more within five months" "Mosquitoes are the great enemy of mankind" etc., the words are all alert and cannot be recorded in detail. From 6:30 p.m. that afternoon, there were also skits by Zhang Yeye and Zhao Xixi, etc., to add to the fun. After the completion, a lottery was held, and the prizes included a 40 yuan gift certificate from the China National Goods Company, as well as electric fans, watches, clothing fabrics, and other valuable items. The Central and Western Radio Stations broadcast speeches. In general, the guests were all excited.</p>
<p>Suspect Arrested for Private Sale of Red Pills</p>
<p>Zhang Hongqiao, a native of Taizhou, recently secretly sold red pills in a kitchen shed at No. 33 Hekangli, Jiujiudi in the city. The other day, he sent his partner Ji Jianlin, a native of Nantong, to hide about 2,000 red pills in the legs of two pairs of pants and send them elsewhere. The patrol police sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to check pedestrians found the red pills on the way, took them to the team, and confessed the previous situation. Detectives were sent to Hekangli to arrest Zhang, and opium was seized. Together with suspects Zhang Jinrong, Guo Mingfeng, Zhang Yaoguang, Wang Zaiming, etc., they were taken to the team. Detectives were sent to continue to arrest Zhang Quansheng, a red pill suspect, at No. 195 Jianli, Fadama Road, and they were all escorted to the Third Section for interrogation.</p>
<p>Fabricated Reports on Mixed-Load Cargoes and Penalty Methods</p>
<p>A circular from the Two Roads Transportation Office stated that the penalty methods for fabricating cargo grades as stipulated in Article 35, Paragraph 1 of the General Rules of Freight Car Transportation were ordered to be followed on September 14 of last year. However, because the two roads have separate cargo, the freight can be calculated separately according to the cargo grade in the same freight ticket, so that when each station encounters a separate cargo with a fabricated grade and pays a penalty, there are misunderstandings that cause inconsistent handling. Now the previous order is reiterated and explained in detail: for separate cargoes, if the types and grades are different in the same freight ticket, if a certain type of cargo has a fabricated report, the entire highest grade of that type of cargo should be fully paid and penalized. For example, if the separate cargoes declared in the same consignment note include 20 pieces of books, 10 pieces of superior stationery, and 15 pieces of ordinary paper, and they are transported, it is later found that 5 pieces of superior paper are夹带 in the reported ordinary paper, then except for the books and stationery, which do not have fabricated reports and grade mismatches, the entire paper, namely 15 pieces, should be fully paid according to the second-class freight and a ten-fold penalty should be added. Also, if there are 6 pieces of silk fabrics for separate cargoes, and the merchant declares them as first-class products, but it is found that there is one piece of artificial silk夹带, then all six pieces of fabrics should be fully paid according to the first-class double freight and a ten-fold penalty should be added. As for the penalty method for fabricated reports on whole-car cargoes, the entire car should be calculated and penalized according to the regulations. It is appropriate to issue a circular to each person to comply, and to supervise and ensure that they are all strictly followed.</p>
<p>The Case of a Large Number of Goods Being Stolen from a Closed Store Was Cracked</p>
<p>Yonghua Department Store Mall at No. 428 Xixinqiao, Fadama Road (ie, the original site of the current Yonghe Company), was declared for liquidation on July 21 of last year due to poor business in the morning and lack of turnover. On the 28th, the creditors petitioned the Second Special District Local Court to inspect the goods and seal the store. At that time, there were more than 30,000 yuan worth of goods in the store. On December 23, both parties reached a settlement and requested the court to unseal the goods. It was discovered that all the valuable goods had been stolen, with a total loss of 27,000 yuan. Tan Huisheng, the manager of the company, issued a loss list and reported to the French Concession police to request an arrest. This was reported in a previous issue. The French Concession Police Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin, Detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, Deputy Detectives Zhou Buguang, Baotan Zhu Jutong, Xue Youlin, and Wang Maoliu, discovered that the thief, Li Gansheng, from Hunan, had recently opened a Jusheng Hotel at No. 87 Bailinan Road, in the Huajie area of ​​Shanghai. He was immediately arrested along with his wife, Li Mao. Later, accomplice Tu Xiangping, also known as Tu Yongqing, from Hubei, was arrested at No. 195 Jiale Road, and stolen goods worth more than 1,000 yuan were recovered in both places. They were taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, the three criminals, Li and Tu, were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and requested for prosecution. Judge Wu Fanglian took the seat for interrogation. Yuan Jiahuan, the lawyer of the police station, stated the facts of the case and claimed that the police station had not yet completed the investigation, and that some accomplices had not been arrested. He requested a postponement, and after arresting the accomplices and verifying the facts of the case, he would file a lawsuit for trial. The court verified the report and briefly questioned the defendants, and then ordered the three defendants to be returned to custody, and approved a change of date for verification.</p>
<p>The Male Corpse at the Entrance of Zhaofeng Garden Was Verified to Have Committed Suicide by Taking Poison</p>
<p>At about 5:00 a.m. yesterday morning, there was a man lying on the ground at the entrance of Zhaofeng Garden. Gao Wenzhen, a night watchman at No. 67, saw that he was foaming at the mouth and his face was pale. He sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment to no avail, and he died shortly after. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Zheng Shoumei, 21 years old, from Gaoqiao, Pudong. He was previously a foreman at the Xinmingji Construction Factory. Recently, due to extreme economic constraints and the inability to marry, he was resentful and committed suicide by swallowing opium. The corpse was carried to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Diao Chengtang of the First Special District Local Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., came to the office to verify the corpse. According to the deceased's mother, Zheng Shen, 39 years old, her son was currently unemployed, so he stayed at home. He suddenly left home the other day, but she did not know that he would take such a step. After obtaining the confession, Diao Jun ordered that the deceased, Zheng Shoumei, male, did indeed commit suicide by poisoning himself with opium before his death. The corpse was handed over to his mother, Zheng Shen, to sign and collect the coffin for burial.</p>
<p>The Careless Behavior of Master and Servant</p>
<p>After the lawsuit, an out-of-court settlement was reached. Feng Zhong, a woman from Hangzhou, was a maid in the house of a certain surname at No. 38 Huarui Lane, Laoshenfu Road, in the French Concession. Due to poverty and difficulty in maintaining her livelihood, she sent her 16-year-old daughter, Acha, to a referral store in the French Concession to wait for a recommendation. A person from Hangzhou, Wang Ziqing, 40 years old, who was previously a messenger at a pharmacy, residing at No. 113 Fuxu Road, wanted to hire a maid. Feng Acha was hired by the Wang family. From January to March 15 of this year, she worked for less than three months. Acha was dismissed due to illness and returned to her mother's place. Feng Zhong sent her to Baolong Hospital. The doctor verified that Feng was infected with syphilis, which was caused by poisoning. Feng Zhong was shocked upon hearing this. Although her daughter was 16 years old, she was not yet satisfied and her development was not complete. How could she have syphilis? Under strict questioning, Feng Acha truthfully confessed that after Wang Ziqing hired her, she was sexually assaulted and repeatedly raped. Wang was infected with gonorrhea, which led to the infection, etc. Feng Zhong was furious upon hearing this and reported the situation to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. The head of the police ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Wang Ziqing, but Wang Ziqing had already fled upon hearing the news. They returned to report to the head of the police and requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant for wanted persons. Until the afternoon of the other day, Wang sneaked home and was arrested by Chinese detective Ji Binkui and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. In addition to stating the facts of the case, the police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, sued the defendant for rape under Article 243, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, and for injury under Article 294, Section 1. The defendant, Wang Ziqing, hired Tang Huaiqun as a lawyer to state in court that the case had been settled out of court, and both parties had lawyers to prove that the defendant had subsidized the plaintiff's medical expenses by 150 yuan, which was collected by Feng Zhong. After verifying the report, Judge Xue Lanru ordered the case to be adjourned for seven days, and the defendant, Wang Ziqing, was ordered to post a bond of 3,000 yuan to be released from custody, pending further interrogation of Feng Zhong.</p>

<p>The Tenth Far Eastern Games Special Issue, No. 5, Shen Bao</p>
<p>Far Eastern Games Fourth Day</p>
<h3 id="e34">Sino-Philippine Basketball Controversy: Interrupted by Rain, China Requests Postponement; Referee Insists on Continuing, Declaring China's Forfeit; China Protests to Competition Committee; Track and Field, Swimming Begin Today <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Philippine basketball game, anticipated nationwide, unexpectedly ended in a dispute last night, unfinished and disappointing. After the first half ended (China trailing 12-26), a heavy rain fell for half an hour, leaving the open-air court extremely wet and unplayable. China, citing the resolution from the International Basketball Federation's guidance meeting that any game interrupted by rain for more than twenty minutes should be stopped, requested a postponement. The referee claimed ignorance of this resolution and insisted on continuing. China refused, and the referee escalated by declaring China's forfeit, sparking outrage and chaos. China has decided to submit the case to the Competition Committee for a fair resolution. Japan's fervent baseball team was defeated 7-0 by the Philippines, causing the two-time champion Japanese team great distress, and the championship is likely to change hands. However, the Philippines lost to Japan 4-3 in soccer. In the second volleyball match, the Philippines won again 3-1. Even more infuriating was the second Sino-Philippine women's volleyball match, where the Chinese team, enduring biased officiating, suffered another crushing defeat. Regrettably, track and field and swimming competitions begin today. In the second Sino-Japanese basketball and volleyball matches, China may regain its advantage.</p>
<p>China Insists on Opposing the Pro-Japanese Puppet Regime's Attempt to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>Based on Legal Principles, Unanimous Approval is Required; Japan's Attempt to Block Korean Policy Backfires; Executive Committee Meeting Scheduled for 18th</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, 15th) The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee, officially notified by the Philippine Athletic Association, has scheduled meetings for 10 AM on the 18th and 19th at the Columbia Club of the Philippines. Each member country can send three official representatives and several assistant committee members, in addition to the Philippine Athletic Association's staff. Proposals must be submitted to the Philippine Athletic Association's Honorary Secretary, Mr. Ylanan, by the 17th. China's representatives are Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Ma John, and Mr. Hao Gengsheng. The assistant committee members are Mr. Dong Shouyi, Mr. Xu Minhui, Mr. Gao Xiwei, and Mr. Shi Zhaokang. Japan will likely propose amending Article 3 of the charter regarding "Members." China's Chief Representative, Mr. Wang Zhengting, is prepared to address this.</p>
<p>Unanimous Approval is What Japan Proposed to Block Korean Accession. The Far Eastern Games charter has no explicit provision. Records of past Executive Committee resolutions serve as the rules and regulations of the conference. Proposals approved by a majority become effective. Not until May 29, 1930, during the Ninth Far Eastern Games in Tokyo, did the Executive Committee pass the current conference charter and bylaws. The drafter of the charter was a Japanese man named Yamamoto, assisted by an American woman named Brown, secretary of a Japanese youth organization. Article 3 explicitly states that the participation of new member countries must be unanimously approved by existing members. The final bylaw stipulates that amendments to the charter can be passed by a two-thirds majority. At the time, Japan insisted on formalizing the past practice of majority approval into the formal charter, requiring unanimous approval, intending to prevent Korea's participation in the Far Eastern Games, as Korea had shown interest in participating in the 1929 Games. Now, Japan suddenly advocates changing the explicit requirement of unanimous approval to majority approval, intending to allow the pro-Japanese puppet regime to participate, contradicting themselves.</p>
<p>China Takes Legal Perspective as Basis. New Members Must Be Unanimously Approved. China has decided to insist on opposing amending this article of the charter. The participation of new member countries requires unanimous approval. Based on legal principles, any article in the charter that requires unanimous approval for its nature must also be amended by unanimous consent. This is evident, unlike other articles that can be passed by a two-thirds majority according to the bylaws. Therefore, Japan's cunning scheme will likely fail.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 15th) The Far Eastern Games Executive Committee meetings are scheduled for the mornings of the 18th and 19th at the Columbia Club. Notifications have been issued. China is fully prepared and coordinated regarding the charter amendment. While other cases of the charter can be amended by majority vote, China will insist on unanimous approval for new member accessions to the very end. Based on legal principles, it cannot be amended without unanimous approval. Japan's devious plan will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 15th) The Sino-Philippine volleyball match, starting at 3 PM yesterday, indeed turned into a fierce battle. Six thousand spectators filled the stands, especially the Chinese support group. The Philippines' accurate play consistently pressured the Chinese team, ultimately securing victory with superiority. The Chinese support group stomped their feet whenever the Philippines scored. Yamada won in tennis without issue. Rong faced Xu, and Xu's accurate serves in the first set led to Xu's victory. At that time, Chinese spectators who had been watching volleyball rushed over, thinking that what was lost in the east might be gained in the west, cheering with high spirits. Starting at 4 PM in the baseball field, women in elaborate costumes performed charming local dances, earning applause from the audience and adding much luster to the games.</p>
<p>Japan Seeks Photo Proof of Chen Baoqiu's Eligibility</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 14th) In the Sino-Japanese volleyball match on the 13th, China fielded a player not registered on the entry list. Japan officially protested to the headquarters. However, China explained that the pronunciation of Chen Baoqiu differs between Beijing and Cantonese, leading to a mistranslation. Therefore, Japan requested attaching a photo to the player's certificate to prove it. This procedure is now being implemented.</p>

<p>China-Philippines Basketball Game Interrupted by Heavy Rain Last Night; China Refuses to Continue Play</p>
<p>Thirty Minutes of Heavy Rain, China Requests Postponement; Referee Unilaterally Declares China's Forfeit; Shen Siliang Denies the Referee's Decision; Decides to Protest to the Competition Committee</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, 15th) Tonight's first China-Philippines basketball game was watched by 10,000 people. Unfortunately, another dispute with the referee occurred, leading to an unfinished result. The Philippines led 26-12 in the first half, but a sudden heavy rain made the wooden floor completely wet, making it impossible to continue the game. The Philippines, having the lead in the first half, insisted on continuing the game. China's representative, Mr. Shen Siliang, citing the decision of the twelve coaches' meeting, requested the referee to postpone the game. The resolution of the coaches' meeting is as follows:</p>
<p>Before a basketball game, if it rains, the game will be moved to the Santo Tomas University basketball court. If it rains during the game, the game will be stopped for twenty minutes. If the rain does not stop, the game will be postponed. Tonight, the rain lasted for thirty minutes. The referees were Mr. Salvarte and Mr. Wenceslao. Mr. Shen Siliang argued with the referee for fifteen minutes. The referee insisted on continuing the game. Mr. Shen ordered the team to refuse to continue the game. The referee then announced to the audience that since the Chinese team refused to play, China would be considered to have forfeited, and the Philippines would win 2-0. The audience was outraged upon hearing the report, causing chaos. The Chinese team stated that they insisted on denying this decision and would submit the matter to the Competition Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Siliang issued a statement saying, "China does not recognize this decision as final and will protest to the Competition Committee. The floor is wet and slippery, and we are unwilling to put our team at great risk. We do not want to put our players in danger by playing on this slippery floor, so we do not want to let our players continue to play. It is extremely difficult to accept the referee's decision."</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 15th) The Philippines' first basketball game against China was held at 8 PM. In the first half, the Philippines led 26-12. As the second half was about to begin, a heavy rain suddenly poured for about fifteen minutes. China's Chief Representative, Mr. Shen Siliang, requested that the game be stopped, saying that the court was too wet and dangerous to continue. However, the Philippine referees, Mr. Salvarte and Mr. Wenceslao, ignored this and insisted on continuing the game. At this time, the referees argued with the Chinese side for fifteen minutes. As a result, the two referees declared that since China refused to play, it would be considered a forfeit, and the Philippines would win 2-0. The audience of over ten thousand was dissatisfied, causing great confusion. Of course, the Chinese side strongly opposed this judgment, so it was decided to submit it to the regular meeting on the 18th to request a fair judgment. Later, Chief Representative Shen told a Dentsu reporter that in such a dangerous situation, his players could not continue to play. "We, as those responsible, cannot put our players in danger under any circumstances. Therefore, we cannot obey today's declaration by the referees," he said.</p>
<p>First Half Recap</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, 15th) The first half of the first China-Philippines basketball game tonight proceeded as follows:</p>
<p>China scored first</p>
<p>Wang Yuzeng's injury and absence were a fatal blow to China. After the start of the game, China first scored a free throw, taking the lead. The Philippines tied it at 5-5, then made it 6-5, and China took back another point. The Philippines called a timeout and replaced four players, then scored eight consecutive points, making it 6-13. Chen Shengkui scored one basket, but the Philippines scored thirteen more points with a fierce attack, making it 8-26. As the first half was about to end, Tang Jia single-handedly made a shot, followed by Li Zhenzhong. The result of the first half was 12-26.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain, Chaos</p>
<p>As the first half ended, heavy rain came immediately. The audience without shelter rushed around, causing chaos. Last night, there were about 10,000 spectators. At the beginning of the game, 700-800 spectators without tickets rushed in, rendering the police ineffective. The preparations were inadequate. China's defeat in the first half tonight was also caused by panic. The results of the first half are as follows:</p>
<p>▲China Free Throws Fouls Points▲Philippines Free Throws Fouls Points</p>

<p>Referee Injustice, Indignation Uncontrollable; China's Women's Volleyball Team Loses to Philippines Again</p>
<p>Endured Pain to Maintain Sportsmanship</p>
<p>Panic Also Contributed to the Defeat</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Manila, 15th) China's women's volleyball team lost again to the Philippines women's team today by a score of 2-1. The scores were 24-22, 16-21, 16-21. In the first set, when the Philippines led 19-16, the Chinese women caught up with three points, tying the score, and then won 24-22. In the second set, the Philippines women led all the way to victory. In the third set, the Philippines women again took the lead 12-4, gradually catching up, but the result was still a defeat of 16-21.</p>
<p>Philippines "22-24, 21-16, 21-16" China</p>
<p>In this match, the referee was obviously unfair, making two extremely wrong judgments. However, in order to show sportsmanship, China did not argue. The Philippines team cooperated better, but the individual techniques were not as good as China's. China made too many mistakes, often hitting the ball out of bounds. The failure in the third set was entirely due to panic, and many points were lost unnecessarily. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>
<p>China Xiao Huiling Huang Xingfen Xiao Jieying</p>
<p>Lu Huihsien Xue Zhijie Sun Xian Liu Yusong</p>
<p>Guan Liuzhu Qian Shuyi</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>
<p>Philippines Talock Furnaze Gelinga</p>
<p>Matus Para Stealiron Malabi</p>
<p>Satuenine Matos</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 15th) In the Sino-Philippine women's volleyball match, China lost by two points in the first game on the 13th, which was a pity. The second game was played again at 5 PM on the 15th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Victory Gained with Difficulty</p>
<p>The Philippines served first, immediately showing courage. The Chinese lineup was disorganized and sluggish, repeatedly missing good opportunities. The Philippines' score soared, leading 11-5 at the change of sides. China was still discouraged and made no progress, falling behind to 20-16. At this point, the players worked together to make beautiful passes and powerful spikes, tying the score. The Philippines refused to yield and fought hard, taking the lead again at 22-21. At this critical moment, the atmosphere was extremely tense. The Chinese players calmly responded, and the back-and-forth was very beautiful. Then, China scored three consecutive points, finally winning 24-22. It was difficult to win this game.</p>
<p>Panic and Failure</p>
<p>China was panicked and unable to cope on the field. The Philippines won 10 points, and China chased hard, making it 8-11 at the change of sides. China still made progress, making it 10-11, only one point behind. But then they showed panic again, and the spikes were not working, so they lost 16-21.</p>
<p>Unfair Refereeing</p>
<p>The key to winning or losing this set was that everyone was careful and cautious. The Philippines did not dare to be careless. Each team scored three points in turn. Unexpectedly, the Philippines suddenly became rampant and scored eight consecutive points to change sides. After continuing the game and each adding two points, China also suddenly gained momentum and launched a counterattack, making it 13-15, only two points behind. The future looked bright, and it was thought that the situation could still be reversed. However, the referee was negligent and made a big mistake. When the Philippines' ball was about to fall out of bounds, he claimed that it was a fair ball, saying that it was inside the line. The Chinese heroines were indignant, and everyone left the field to rest. After Shen Siliang's best efforts to persuade them, they completed the game, allowing for further negotiations. The women had no heart to continue fighting, so they suffered a miserable defeat of 16-21.</p>
<p>Japan Greatly Disappointed; Baseball Team Lost to the Philippines</p>
<p>7-0, Japan Shut Out. The Philippines is Confident of Winning This Year's Championship.</p>
<p>In the first baseball game between the Philippines and Japan, which is related to the Far Eastern Games championship, the Philippines team's strength increased suddenly due to the reinstatement of former professional players as amateurs. Japan had long been wary of this. As expected, the Philippines won a major victory of 7-0, which greatly discouraged Japan.</p>
<p>The Philippines' Pitcher is Excellent</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 15th) The first Japan-Philippines baseball game, which is the focus of this tournament, started at 3 PM today at the newly built baseball field. In the game against the Chinese team, the Philippines won 25-1, and Japan won 20-1, so the strength of the two teams is almost equal. The Philippines wants to win all the baseball games, and the Japanese expatriates are also cheering for the Japanese team, hoping for a sure victory, so the popularity is high, and the tickets were sold out in the morning. Before the game, there were 20,000 spectators, and there were still 2,000 standing on the unfinished iron frames of the stands.</p>
<p>The heavy rain in the morning forced a temporary postponement of the baseball game, which greatly disappointed the fans. Fortunately, the sky suddenly cleared at 1 PM, and it was decided to start the game. At 3 PM, the Philippines took the first attack. Under the fierce fighting consciousness of the players of both teams, each tried their best. However, the Philippines' strange pitcher, Balderrucco, had extraordinary pitching skills, blocking the Japanese army's attack. Only the first and third times had a few hits that were enough to threaten the enemy, but they failed to score. On the contrary, the Philippines' hit the ball well, passing the pitcher, so they replaced him with Kikugaya. As a result, the Philippines defeated Japan by a score of 7-0. Also, during the game, the third baseman, Kakuda, was injured and retired.</p>
<p>Lineups of Both Teams</p>
<p>(Jiji Press, Manila, 15th) The lineups of the Japan-Philippines baseball game are as follows (batters are in order):</p>

<p>Japan-Philippines Baseball Game. The Philippines' pitcher was strong, and the offense and defense were effective. Although Japan tried hard, it had no effect. The Philippines scored one point in the first inning, two points in the second inning, two points in the fifth inning, one point in the seventh inning, and one point in the ninth inning, for a total of seven points. The Japanese team did not score at all and was defeated. The game ended at 5:30.</p>
<p>Course of Competition</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 15th) In today's second Japan-Philippines baseball game, the referees were Philippines' Gongales (ball), Garipidan, Peranubal, and Arias (base). The Philippines took the first attack.</p>
<p>First Inning: The Philippines' Reimert hit a single. Due to the Japanese army's Nagai's bad throw at third base, the Philippines got one point first. After one out, Japan's Honggo had four balls, but the follow-up was unsuccessful and he retired without success.</p>
<p>Second Inning: The Philippines' Estralada was born because the shortstop missed. After Escalamos and Bartalfer died, Santolochai hit second base, and then scored a point. Peralnar also hit a single, allowing Santolochai to run back, and scored another point. After one out in Japan, Kakuda hit a single, but there was no successor.</p>
<p>Third Inning: The Japanese army replaced Tsuji with Kikugaya. The Philippines did not score, and neither did Japan.</p>
<p>Fourth Inning: Both teams did not score.</p>
<p>Fifth Inning: The Philippines' Estralada, Bartalfer, Santolochai, and Escalamos hit four consecutive singles, so they scored two points. The Japanese army did nothing.</p>
<p>Sixth Inning: Both teams did not score.</p>
<p>Seventh Inning: The Philippines' Escalamos and Bartalfer both hit singles. Santolochai followed, and Escalamos ran back to the base, and scored another point. Japan's Kikugaya hit a front single, and the Japanese expatriates cheered, but the successors were mediocre.</p>
<p>Eighth Inning: The Philippines did not score. Japan's Katada and Nagai hit singles to the front on the right, so there was one dead and two left. Unfortunately, Matsui died again. Although Katada stole third base, Kakuda struck out, so the good opportunity was missed.</p>
<p>Ninth Inning: The Philippines' Estralada hit third base in the middle of the right, and returned to the base with Escalamos's swimming, and scored. In total, the Philippines scored seven points. The Japanese players who appeared each took this as their last chance, wanting to wash away this shame, but Bartal's pitching was impossible to figure out, so the Japanese army could not play, and as a result, they got nothing. Victory went to the Philippines.</p>

<p>China vs. Japan Second Round Starts This Afternoon</p>
<p>A Record of the Chinese Delegation's Safe Arrival in the Philippines</p>
<p>Overseas Compatriots Welcome Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Athletes' Food Intake Increases Greatly</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent's Dispatch from Manila) The Chinese delegation attending the 10th Far Eastern Games arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 6th. That night, they continued their journey by ship and arrived safely in Manila on the morning of the 8th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Eager to Disembark in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The President McKinley arrived in Hong Kong waters at about 8:00 AM on the 6th and anchored off Kowloon, across from Hong Kong. The South China Athletic Association specially sent a small boat to welcome them. The most noticeable person on the small boat was the King of Football, Li Huitang, and the Mermaid, Yang Xiuqiong. The athletes on the two boats waved to each other, and their joy was indescribable. Especially Li Ning, the football star who went to Hong Kong in advance, was overjoyed when he saw the senior women's volleyball player Guan Liuzhu, which could not be fathomed by others. Although the inspection of bodies and luggage was only a formality, it was not completed until 10:30 AM. At this time, the athletes, who had been cooped up on the ship for three days, eagerly disembarked, like , and were received by the members of the South China Athletic Association. They took a small to Hong Kong and went to the association to rest.</p>
<p>Training at the South China Athletic Association Field</p>
<p>The newly built South China Athletic Association field is very magnificent. After the athletes arrived at the field, they eagerly changed their clothes and went to the field to do some light exercises. The track and field had all kinds of running, jumping, and throwing events. The basketball players also took turns playing. The women's volleyball players swung their fists, and everyone was active. However, the weather was hot, and everyone was covered in sweat when they stopped at noon. Then, the South China Athletic Association prepared refreshments to entertain them. Chairman Luo Wenjin gave a welcome speech, and Wang Zhengyan gave a reply, giving brilliant remarks and winning a lot of applause. After the speech, the dishes were in a mess, so they left together. In the afternoon, some athletes visited Hong Kong. The tennis players, both men and women, practiced in the field. The baseball players made friends with the McKinley ship team for a friendly match. It was the first time they worked together. As a result, they only won 4-3. If it is so difficult to win against an ordinary ship team, then the future can be with Japan and the Philippines. The urgent need to promote baseball in China can also be seen here.</p>
<p>Continuing from Hong Kong</p>
<p>They got off the ship at 6 PM and continued on their way at 7 PM. The ship added a large number of athletes, and the lively scene can be imagined. The first-class deck, smoking lounge, swimming pool, and cinema were always full of athletes. However, because the dining room was not large enough, they ate in two groups. The boat was very smooth. At dinner, the ship's staff thought it was the last meal, so they decorated the dining room with national flags to express their love. A paper loudspeaker was placed in front of the storehouse and rang from time to time, and the music in the dining room was overflowing, making everyone feel very happy.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome from Overseas Compatriots</p>
<p>When the ship was about to arrive in the Philippines on the morning of the 8th, the Philippine government sent airplanes to circle the ship in welcome, further increasing the athletes' interest. At 8:30 AM, they arrived in Manila and anchored in the middle of the river. After about an hour, they finished the body and luggage inspection. The athletes waited on the deck in the scorching sun and extremely hot weather, which was very painful. At 10:30 AM, the inspection was completed, and the McKinley stopped at the dock. Over ten thousand overseas compatriots at the dock waved towels and shouted wildly. The sounds of the five or six bands could hardly be heard because of this. The patriotism of the overseas compatriots could be seen from this. The Philippine Athletic Association representative and the Chinese Consul General to the Philippines, Kuang Guanglin, boarded the ship first to welcome them. Then, the daughter of the overseas merchant Chen Wenkeng, who was elected the Queen of this year's Carnival, led over twenty women from the overseas community to board the ship to present flowers to the chief of the delegation, Wang Zhengting, and the women athletes. After the presentation, Wang led them off the ship, with Zhang Lingjia and Chen Baoqiu holding the national flag and team flag, amid the enthusiastic cheers of the overseas compatriots. When they left the station, photographers and welcomers surrounded the group, blocking the road. After many twists and turns, they finally cleared a path and filed out. The Philippine Athletic Association prepared over twenty large and small cars for the group to ride in. The cars were covered, and the strong sunlight made them feel like ovens. Soon, the group boarded the cars and circled the city before heading to Lachal University. The men athletes stayed here, and the women athletes stayed at the Philippine Women's University nearby. Both schools were near the sports field, which was extremely convenient.</p>
<p>General Accommodation for Athletes</p>
<p>I did not visit the women athletes' accommodations. The men athletes, including the staff, stayed in the classrooms of Lachal University, with 20-30 people in each room. There was a small iron bed and a newly made mosquito net. That was all. The food was made by a Chinese cook, which was palatable. However, there were not enough vegetables for the large number of athletes to chew, and the stomach was not full before the plate was empty, so they were planning to improve it. Because they were tired from the journey on the 8th, they rested for half a day. They started practicing on the 9th. The sports field was not yet completed and was being built overnight. It was hoped that it would be completed before the opening ceremony on the 12th. What the results of the competition will be, there is no need to guess in this letter. It is expected that when this letter arrives, the results of each item will already be known. (Sent from Lachal University, Manila, May 9)</p>
<p>Philippine Swimmers Secretly Practice in the Rain</p>
<p>(Jiji Press, Manila, 15th) This morning before dawn, it rained heavily, with thunder rumbling. At 8 AM, the black clouds gradually dispersed, and the sun was faintly visible, but the rain did not stop. The Philippine swimmers had already hidden themselves in the rain to practice intensely. The sound of gunshots from the starting line could be heard from the dormitory.</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Private Middle School Track and Field, First Day: Huilan Wins Two Championships; Tennis and Volleyball Start Tomorrow for Two Days.</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Private Middle School Athletic Association's track and field competition started yesterday at the John's University sports field in Fanwangdu. The participants included Shanghai John's Middle School, Shanghai University Middle School, Nanjing Jinling Middle School, Suzhou Taocai Qingwu Middle School, Yancheng Middle School, Hangzhou Zhijiang Middle School, and Huilan Middle School, a total of seven schools. The track and field competition is scheduled to end today, and the tennis and volleyball competitions will be held at John's University from tomorrow to the 19th. Only Huilan did not participate. Yesterday, there were five track and field finals. Because there was a problem with the 1,500-meter race, the results could not be announced. In the remaining four events, Huilan had the advantage. John's, Huilan, and Shanghai University were most likely to win the championship. The details are described below.</p>
<p>A Small Problem</p>
<p>There was a small problem with the last final event, the 1,500-meter race, so the results could not be announced. The reason was that Huilan Middle School only registered three people, but when the names were called for the competition, there were four. As a result, Huilan had two people selected, which needs to be resolved by the committee.</p>
<p>Situation of Each School</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huilan had an advantage in the four finals, but John's had a lot of power in the track preliminary rounds. The two schools had a fierce battle for the championship, and Shanghai University also had a lot of hope. The scores of each school yesterday were as follows (Yancheng 0 points).</p>
<p>Track</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai University... 5 points</p>

<p>Business News &amp; Finance   Swap Discount Cheap   Gold Price Drops $13.70   Swap Buyers Pay $2.50 Premium   New Chips 24080 Bars</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw swaps, with some parties spreading rumors of bulls paying a $6 premium, coupled with the blockage of Eastern goods sources. The market opened extremely stable, slightly retreating due to unfavorable news. Later, with extremely cheap swap discounts, bearish activities led to a decline. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US both rose. The Five Metals Exchange saw the forward silver price narrow from 50 cents to 2%, rising 70 cents and 3%. Exchange rates slightly decreased. London spot gold rose 1.5 pence. US wheat shrank by half a cent. US cotton fell 3 pounds. The market opened and immediately fell, but due to swap relationships, it recovered from the low. It gradually rose from 25 onwards. Everyone in the market knew that over 3,000 taels of Eastern cash had been intercepted, and the source would be stagnant. Coinciding with the swap, short sellers were apprehensive, and bulls tried to push up, rebounding to $36.50. Later, the banks' appetite strongly suppressed it, causing a downward spiral. Afterward, Reuters reported that US Senator Thomas announced today that he planned to propose an amendment to the silver legislation, requiring countries to be allowed to repay a portion of war debts due in June with silver. The domestic market became even looser and retreated into the $30 range, but confidence remained stable. The Seattle night market silver price fell by half a cent but rebounded. The market opened weakly due to low swap discounts. Although the Seattle night market silver price closed up by 1.125, the forward price shrank by 0.25, still struggling around $30. However, the cheap discount was unexpected. Short sellers repeatedly acted, and confidence gradually waned. Mumbai rose five annas twice in a row, and the domestic market also hardened accordingly.

Since the middle of this week, the collection and settlement situation from all aspects since Monday the day before yesterday seems to be slightly cumbersome, and it is still sluggish yesterday, because the current industries are declining and financial circulation cannot be smooth. Each is extremely difficult and unable to fill its vigorous desire. Eventually, most of the long-term income is more than the income, and the general situation feels like a stalemate. If this continues, cash concentration will never have the hope of circulation, so yesterday the foreign money demolition market price saw weakness again. Both the morning and noon markets were 5 points, which was a little less than the day before yesterday, and the head and water were added by 2 or 3 points, which was still the same as the day before yesterday.

Securities Hesitate, Central Debt Market Weak Yesterday, the Chinese merchant securities trading market became more and more sluggish and lackluster. There were rumors in the market that the 23-year customs tax treasury bonds were preparing to be listed for trading. The environment and atmosphere became more and more chaotic. The diplomatic situation has not yet shown a trend to open up. There are still many thorns in the future. It is really not easy to boost morale. However, it is temporarily inevitable to hesitate. A major change should still be in the back. Yesterday, after the morning opening, No. 48 bought the compiled legacy, raising it by 4 corners, and No. 21 took advantage of the momentum to sell it. The auction cut the troops and immediately felt powerless, only about 1 corner. After entering, it immediately felt lackluster, but it was still slightly firm. After the gold was short, all returned to 5 cents and 1 corner, and the situation was obviously depressed. The second game was a unanimous return to small, and the compiled legacy plummeted by 4 corners. The high of the first game can be called a false lift. After the afternoon opening, No. 14 suddenly had cut troops to sell, and the number was slightly large. Although No. 53 still had to eat in, the market price was a small 3 corners or so, and the rest were also a small 1 or 2 corners. Only this month's 22nd level was slightly better than 1 and a half corners. At the close, both No. 5 and No. 15 had sales, and the market price was very flat, slightly 5 cents and 1 corner, and this month's gold shortage was better by 1 corner. On the whole, it hesitated with fatigue. There were very few table transactions. Those with a large number of ins and outs caused slight waves in the market price, so it was mostly stagnant. As a result, the market price was slightly smaller by 1 corner to 4 and a half corners. The total number of transactions totaled 7.101 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall, high and low are compared and listed on the left.

Xin Feng Yanghang reported that yesterday the 14th New York stock market was weak because the Senate had passed the exchange case and Wall Street's morale was still gloomy. The wind of throwing continued to be endless. The industrial stock index also created a new low since November last year. In the end, the wind turned high, because the market had fallen for many days and the technical position was excellent. A slight purchase was easy to rise sharply. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day. The short sellers made up for it today, and professional speculators made more transactions. The bulls were a little timid and bought in. The public believed that the exchange case would eventually be beneficial, which made the market skyrocket. The small exchange trended lower. The speculative nature of the bonds fell sharply. The high-level bonds were settled and firm. The US public debt was mixed. Grains fell due to partial rainfall in the early zone.

(cotton) The market is fluctuating and shaking, reflecting the possibility of reducing work on the Wharton development and the yarn factory, and most people are uncertain. The spot is stagnant, the base is firm, and the total domestic consumption in the United States in April is 512.703 bales. (rubber) It fell in the early morning, and the industry bought a lot. The bulls seem to have stopped selling. The technical position has reached the point of progress. Someone claimed that if the price rose sharply from the current price, the manufacturers would use old rubber goods. (silver) It seems that there is a large amount of purchase in the near term. The speculators are waiting for the results of the silver party meeting tomorrow (15th) and are unwilling to sell. The total turnover for the whole day was 1.68 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.

<p>(Paris) The French Parliament will soon reconvene. Taking this opportunity, Premier Doumergue will deliver a radio broadcast speech at 8 o'clock tonight to announce to the nation the accomplishments of the current government. He will especially emphasize the achievements in easing public sentiment and in the judiciary. The Premier stated that the government's responsibilities are not yet complete, and it is still necessary for all political parties to completely abandon their prejudices. The government should also reform the tax system and alleviate the agricultural panic in order to complete its mission. As for international affairs, France holds no resentment towards any country and has no territorial ambitions whatsoever. Its intention has always been to maintain peace. However, France, learning from past experiences, will not fail to seek reliable guarantees in terms of security. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e38">British-Made Aircraft Sold to Germany: Simon Claims This Action Does Not Violate Treaties <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(London) France, regarding the sale of aircraft engines to Germany by some British manufacturers, has requested an explanation from here. During the House of Commons session today, someone mentioned that Germany had ordered eighty aircraft from the British Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft company. Foreign Secretary Simon stated that this matter does not violate international treaties, a point he will solemnly explain in his response to France. As for what measures Britain will take regarding the export of aircraft engines and parts, Simon only stated that according to the treaty, Germany should not purchase armored aircraft or models of aircraft for combat purposes. Britain will also continue its efforts to ensure that British manufacturers do not supply Germany with materials that violate the treaty. Simon also stated that Britain's policy regarding the restriction of air force use has been stated in Britain's disarmament memorandum. (Note: Britain had previously advocated that aerial bombardment should only be applicable to remote areas. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Post expressed opposition to American manufacturers selling arms to certain foreign countries. The newspaper stated that the amount of aviation materials recently sold by American aircraft manufacturers to Germany is increasing.

<h3 id="e39">Silver for Debt Repayment Issue: American Bankers Approve of This Idea <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas announced today that the proposed silver bill may be amended to allow the government to accept silver as payment for the war debts due in June. European countries would pay their debts in silver at a rate of 50 cents per ounce. Thomas also stated that paying in silver seems to be the only way to resolve the war debts due on June 15th, because debtor nations do not have sufficient gold reserves, and the United States is unwilling to accept goods in lieu of payment. Moreover, we need silver as a reserve for the new currency. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that most members of the British Cabinet believe that paying a portion of the debt as a sign of good faith is the same as not paying the debt at all, and will be regarded as a breach of obligation. Therefore, it is better not to pay the installment due in June. Thus, whether Britain will repay a portion of its debt to the United States in the next installment will depend on how President Roosevelt explains his policy. The British government has instructed its ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to inquire with the American government whether Britain's credit payment will be regarded as a breach of obligation as defined in the American Johnson Act. When this matter was discussed in the House of Commons today, members asked how the American Johnson Act applies to British government bonds and obligations. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that, according to newspaper reports, the United States Attorney General has stated his opinion that Britain's credit payment should not be regarded as a breach of obligation under the Johnson Act. A member asked whether the credit payment would be suspended while the position is unclear. The Foreign Secretary replied that this matter depends on the circumstances. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e42">American Dockworkers' Strike: More Than Ten Killed and Wounded <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco Tonight, striking workers and police clashed again. Two demonstrators were killed and more than ten were seriously injured. Hundreds of strikers, wielding clubs and throwing bricks, broke through the police line, attempting to attack the sailors who were loading and unloading goods and breaking the strike. The police initially retaliated with batons and issued a riot warning. The emergency police force rushed to the scene of the riot immediately. After jumping out of their vehicles, they raised their guns and warned the demonstrators that they would open fire if they did not retreat. The strikers ignored the warning and the fighting intensified. The police then opened fire, and dozens of people were wounded and fell to the ground. Other strikers scattered and fled. Some strikers tried to rescue their fallen comrades, but were blocked by the police. The police immediately cleared the docks. Rioters shouted slogans such as "Down with the police" and "Butchers" from a distance. The police immediately transported the injured to the hospital, where many may not survive. The two dead are said to be members of the International Longshoremen's Association. Special police are now stationed at various docks. If the situation does not ease, the state government's security forces will also be deployed. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>San Francisco Ships at ports in San Francisco, Seattle, and other locations are stranded and unable to move because the dockworkers' strike has not abated at all. Seattle police are now patrolling the waterfront with full force to prevent riots. More than twenty merchant ships are trapped there. Most shipowners are trying to find ways to get the merchant ships moving. It is expected that if order is not restored, the Governor of Washington State will be forced to send troops to maintain it. Non-union workers were recruited to load and unload goods on Saturday and Sunday in order to allow ships to enter and exit, but this action has caused serious disturbances. Therefore, whether employers at various ports will continue with this plan is currently undecided. (14th Reuters Telegram)</p>
