<p>墨索里尼氏在歐洲雖不能取得絕對的領導權力。但黑衣宰相之理論。已遍及中歐。凡爾賽體系。且爲之根本動搖。德國在反凡爾賽關係上。自不能不與意大利採取一致行動。匈奧諸國。爲保持其自國生存起見。亦以意國之馬首是瞻。於是意大利以地小民貧之國家。得起而與法蘭西在地中海爭霸。在北非洲爭雄。同時更伸其勢力於中歐。假使凡爾賽體系而竟破敗。國際聯盟而竟改組。德國之軍備平等要求而竟實現者。則今日之意大利。不難擴張其支配南歐之力。進而執全歐之牛耳。惟觀目前情勢。法國旣擁有八百億法郎以上之現金。復據世界第一之飛行隊之王座。意大利無論如何强項。絕難於短少時期內。越過法國而支配全歐也。　　意大利亦自明白此種情勢。乃不惜放鬆其極端保守的國粹論。在外交上極力謀與蘇聯接近。意固在獲得東歐之聲援。以便其縱橫南歐。馳逐於地中海。而抑制法蘭西也。惟墨索里尼於一月中旬。曾高倡日蘇戰爭之危險論。匪特將直接波及中美兩國。且於英意荷亦有間接影響。彼除稱讚日本產業機褠發達以外。更謂日本國民富於好戰精神。其武力亦頗盛旺。又謂日本經濟勢力。已遍及於全世界。所謂黄禍。雖不如昔日之猛烈。然意國則已深感威脅。故提倡白種諸國。應急謀政治的合作。夫意總理爲一國最高負責者。而在精神上又頗與日本之軍國的法西斯主義相接近。矧意日之間。誠如日本外交當局所云。實際上并無衝突。外交關係亦甚穩妥。則意相何以發此排日之論。昌言白種諸國合作。以惹起日本之不快耶。據日方所傳。意相發表上述論文後。意國各報且就此發揮與墨氏同樣論調。意國國會中。亦流露與此同樣之見解。因此日本駐意大使松島肇對意相特提質詢。是日意之問。已釀成外交上正式之言論戰爭矣。此種言論戰爭。固不必究其結果如何。然同是傾向法西斯主義之國家。一則以歐洲之領導者自居。一則以獨霸亞細亞自豪。東西相映。對立之嚴重性。已可窺見。而昨日塔斯社所發表之史丹林在大會之報吿。極力誇張其計劃之成功。對日本亦。大加警吿。詞意與墨索里尼同一嚴重。日外部對此亦感不快。决發聲明書與史丹林舌戰。意與蘇聯爲主義絕不相同之國家。而亦竟默相契合。先後對日加以同樣之攻擊。則意蘇間之互結聲援。表示遠東問題之主張一致同情。更爲顯然矣。　　夫遠東問題之瀕於危境。非特意國知之。蘇聯知之。卽英美諸國亦莫不知。惟當事各國。皆深知危機爆發。足以毁壞遠東巿塲。關係諸國在經濟上必同受重大損失。而本身亦難保不根本傾覆。故皆未敢冒此世界大戰後未有之危險。然見日本之雄心勃發。則又皆一致擴充軍備。海陸空軍。莫不積極發展。美國之建造新艦艇。英國之築新嘉坡軍港。固無論矣。而蘇聯之極力注意於國防。意大利之擴張軍備。目光皆集於遠東之日本。世界戰禍之將臨。愈趨愈近。各國對立之形勢。已無從調解。而意大利聯蘇制法之歐局關係。猶其小焉者也。</p>

<p>籌委歡宴工業司長劉蔭茀</p>
<p>新聲社云、全國生產會議、自經推定籌備委員後、昨日下午七時、特在漢口路益友俱樂部、歡宴實業部工業司司長劉蔭茀、並卽交換意見、茲將劉司長談話誌下、</p>
<h3 id="c146">歡宴劉氏 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>全國生產會議籌備委員及召集人、於昨日午後七時、在漢口路益友俱樂部、歡宴實業部工業司長劉蔭茀、並於席間舉行談話會、到者計有郭順·王雲五·吳蘊初·錢承緒·胡西園·穆藕初·榮宗敬·及劉司長等二十餘人、聞交換意見之結果、關於（一）提案範圍、及大會經費等、原則上均已有相當决定、</p>
<h3 id="c147">劉司長談 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>劉司長語新聲社記者云、此次生產會議之召集、原係根據三中全會時孫哲生伍朝樞等各中委提案、以挽救我國生產衰落之危機、此次各省市之召集人名單、完全依照各省市之工業發達狀况如何而定其多寡、所聘者均屬工業界有聲望者、此次會議、希望能多顧到環境及事實方面、力避空言無補之泛案、冀將來能易於推行實施、就本人意見、此次會議討論範圍之槪括要點、可分爲二、（甲）關於經濟方面者、如（一）如何請金融界投資本國生產事業、（二）實施關税保護政策、及减輕生產品之税率、（三）屬於運輸方面之交通問題、（乙）關於廠商本身者、如（一）屬於組織方面之管理制度之改良、會計制度之改革、推銷方法之改進、（二）屬於技術方面之出品改良、（三）如何開發本國原料品等、蓋我國年來事實衰落　、不能有長足進展之原因、一方面固因政治上之種種關係、一方面廠商自身組織上之未能健全、亦屬一大原因、觀外商在華工業之發達、雖有情形不同地方、惟關於一切組織上技術上、均屬優良於我者、故此次會議之結果如何、但實業部方面、總希望廠商能致力於此也云云、</p>
<h3 id="c148">硫酸錏廠 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>繼謂、實業部工業司現盡量設法站於推動地位、以推進各種工業、自因一二八戰事以後、深感工業上原料品之缺乏、尤其當滬戰劇烈之際、硫酸錏主要原則一項、發生極大因難、若不速謀補救、關係國防、實非淺鮮、故實業部有鑒於此、遂卽籌備自設硫酸錏廠、進行以來、外商之願投資者極多、嗣經籌議結果、純由本國商股辦理、計資本一千萬元、投資者皆係金融界及實業界、最近中政會議决、限於一年內成立、故不久可望逐部實現、</p>
<h3 id="c149">設酒精廠 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>又謂、酒精廠自實業部主動設備以來、滬上及其他各部之願開設者甚多、惟爲顧及本國國內之需要實况起見、仍由官商合辦一廠、專利經營、暫時限江浙閩三省區域內再不准有同樣之酒精廠之籌設、以免蹈我國商人歷來無謂竸爭之弊、致結果發生因過剩而同歸於不利、惟將來如需要上有感於不敷供求時、亦可臨時變通辦法、現自籌備以來、離成立之期、亦已不遠矣、</p>
<h3 id="c150">中央機廠 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>至於中央機器廠、自决定借中英庚欵進行以來、將來關於機器方面、由中英庚欵購料委員會辦理、籌備業已就緒、廠址問題、前雖擇於南京市區內、惟一因地形須擇較高者、其次須顧到購買者方面之便利、故尙在研究中、一俟廠址决定、建築經費籌妥機件等、祗須正式通知、三個月中卽可運到、實業部亦期於本年內實現、至於鋼鐵廠問題、關係重要、尙須愼重研究、何時簽字、爲時尙早云、</p>
<h3 id="c151">工廠檢查 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>最後復據答稱、上海市租界工廠檢查問題、逢經雙方進行、原極順利、惟因租界方面、中途爲管轄問題、發生阻滯、延擱至今、惟此事因係勞工司範圍、本人亦不甚熟悉、惟悉實業部對於此舉、因關係工人福利安全、决意設法推行、不久或將與滬租界當局重商折衷辦法云、</p>

<p>招商局長江輪建國輪、在馬當被淺水所阻、致遲誤行期、嗣經安慶分局派船往拖、方將建國拽離淺灘、至昨日午後、始得進口、計已遲到三十數小時矣、今日出卸貨物後、該輪便入廠修理、又三北之松浦輪、亦在馬當阻住、後至九江、駁去貨物、减輕儎脚、方始開出、至昨日午後始到、</p>

<p>（三）自學的途徑</p>
<p>昨是從讀書的目的方面講，現在再說讀書的方法。</p>
<p>讀書的方法、卽是一個初學的所應採取的步驟。我們現在把它分爲五個時期，　　我們的讀書者，大都是中途失學的，文字方面的根基還不十分堅固，所以，我們認爲他們讀書的初步，是在把讀者的工具卽文字弄得通順。我們知道讀書必須能了解文字；若看不懂書上的文字，就想明白書的內容，豈非笑話。而在現在，則有許多讀者正犯了這個毛病，他們常常在歸還我們圖書館的書上，寫着許多壞的評語，說這本書文字是如何晦澀，或譯筆是如何生硬，固然有許多書確是如此，但有計多書則經我們細細閱讀的結果（因爲讀者的提示）覺得這文並不見得十分惡劣、或難懂，而且這些書大都是些文藝書，並無專門名詞和須要有相當的學識纔看得懂這種困難的，因此我們不能不說這是讀者文字的修養尙嫌不够和讀書的不認眞。所以，我們希望一般文學根基末堅强的讀者，對此多多注意，因爲這是讀書的先决問題。然而，學習文字，除掉希望研究語文學者外，不過是一種工具，我們學到能够看懂現代文，會寫清楚的文章就儘够了，却不可爲了文字面費許多時間，　　因爲我國科學的落後，許多人主張讀書者必須讀外國語，這一點，我們是不能完全贊同的，其理由已見關於選擇科目的幾個問題，（見一月十三，十四，兩日本欄）讀者當能復按，不再贅述了，</p>
<p>以上是讀書的第一時期，這一時期的工作可與上述的準備時期的工作同時並進，或在　　時　之前完成。　　以上兩步工作完成之後，則選擇科目已被决定，同時讀書的工具亦可說是組異，如此就可開始照其所選擇的學科研究。在開始時，我們主張　　　一本該學科「槪論」「綱要」這類　　　　，務必要把該學科的內容，基本槪念　　　於胸中。在此時期讀書不在於「多」，而在於「精」。因爲在初學時候，最怕的是不能得到系統的槪念，而充滿了一肚子的零碎雜亂的知識。故「精讀」（Ｔｎｔｅｎ　ｉｕｅ　Work）是初學者所必須遵守的惟一原則。編者在大學初年級讀書時，因求知慾甚高，讀書喜多書快，但結果則知識非但不因此而豐富，反因此而使所習學科之基楚概念亦不能明晰了解。這是編者親身經歷的痛苦，如今後悔不及，甚望有志讀書者不要再蹈我的「覆轍」，　　如果讀者對於基礎知識已是粗具，那接着做的讀書工作，不是去讀許多專門著作，不是去研究各種學說，不是去研究學科的發展史，不是去做某種小問題的研究……而是去研究「治學方法論」。在現在，因爲整個社會正處在大動搖的時代，所以各種學說紛起。我們在這些紛亂的學說中去尋求眞理。眞不是一椿易事，但亦不是一椿難事。因爲學說的紛歧，大都是由於觀點的不同，「所採取的方法論」不同所致，如果我們對於「治學方法論」能够奠定下堅固的基礎，爲各種學說纒擾」的事，我想，是决計没有的。因此，第三個時期的中心工作，我們以爲最好是研究治學方法論。　　但是單有方法，没有材料亦是不行的，所以讀書的第四個時期工作是「博覽」。（Ｅｘｔｅｎｓｉｕｅ　Ｗｏｒｋ）所謂「博覽」也者，就是使增廣你的見聞，開展你的知識範圍。因爲知識範圍一廣，你就不致陷於「孤陋寡聞」，不致爲某一種學說所蒙蔽。（讀者可參看一月十日本欄學說的紛歧與正確理論的把握）　　在「博覽」這一時期中。同時讀者更宜旁及許多與其所學習的學科有聯繫的科目。期如習讀「經濟學」的人，那他不但是要看過許多經濟學名著，經濟學專門問題和經濟史之類的書，他還須習讀其他科目，如心理學，統計學，政治學之類。因爲人類的整個活動是不能分爲經濟的，政治的……但是在科學上爲了研究便利起見，却可分成許多類的科目名稱。而且，研究學術有許多工具科目，如文字，統計學之類都是的。所以我們爲要使所習的科目精深，其他輔助的和有相關性的科目是不可不兼讀的。　　自學過程已說了一個大槪。但在照這個過程自學時却有應注意的數點，這裏順便提出：　　（一）書籍的選擇務須嚴格，因爲讀了歪曲事實的書反不如不讀書之爲愈，這個條件在作「凖備」和「精讀」工作時尤宜注意。　　（二）讀書須經濟，現在的書籍眞是汗牛充梀，憑一個人的能力是萬不能讀完一切書的。不過讀者却也不要憤恨，因爲有許多書實在是無讀之必要的。所以讀者在讀某種書時，務必考慮一下：讀了它是否較讀旁的書更有益處，而時間及精力方面是否經濟。　　（三）博覽」和「習其他輔助科目」時，應當比較其輕重，在心中應當想：還是「博覽」要要耶，還是「習其他輔助科目」要緊。</p>
<p>（四）不可爲了「手段」的學習而妨害了「目的的學習，譬如學「統計學」若是爲了研究「經濟學」的原故，那萬不可因爲學習「統計學」費了無窮時間，而把「經濟學」反擱置不問了。　　自學所應注意的不止之幾點，就是這幾點也還有再加詳細討論的必要，不過此信已寫得很長了，所以未盡之言祇好留待以後有必要時，再爲提出討論罷，｜康｜</p>

<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>死、這是多麼幽黯，悽慘，頹喪的字眼喲！如果說某一人死了，你是怎樣的爲他悲傷，同時就有一種實感製來，使你覺得一切都是空虛的。或者有一個人和你入！「我要去死了！」你又是怎樣驚駭，詫異，必定要竭力去阻止他這個企圖。　　所以死是一切生物的仇敵，人固然都在咒詛它，就是其他動物也没有不願避免的。但是道個倔强的魔！！死，對於一切是决不妥恊，决不寬容、這樣人類的悲劇就注定了。　　於是人生舞臺就常有可歌可泣的演出，無論富貴貧賤，死的降臨是無法阻止的，同時無論誰必然的都要碰到這一個歸宿。　　死的偉大和威力從這裏就可以見到了，它没有現社會的勢利，阿謏、不平等，無論智愚賢不肖，它的待遇是一律的。不過在我的觀察上，或者對於富人要虐待一點，這在醫治上看是很顯見的。因爲富人有的是錢，他們病了，一天幾十個醫生上門，不要說病人的精神被攪擾得不安，就是那許多苦藥也呌病人增加痛苦的。這並不是我瞎說，例子很多，最近就有一位富人，他的六歲孫子病了二十餘日，醫治費花了兩萬餘，結果還是給死神帶去。窮人的孩子雖然没有過度醫治的痛苦，也往往要死亡的死神在這一點上不能不說它很公平了。　　不過死這一個字究竟是世界上最恐怖的名詞，現在科學倡明，對於死還是没有方法對付。科學無論如何進步，到底敵不過死神的兇殘，所以人們在死的威脅下，往往相互諒解的，實在你一世爭天奪地，到死神降臨的時候，還是一無所有的。　　也有不死的人，那是在他生的時候，曾爲人類社會造下不少的幸福，他的軀體雖然死了，他的精神還是長存人間，只有這種人是不死的。不死的人，究竟是很少的。然而這不死的人生，確實是社會所需要的，所以我希望人類都不死！</p>

<p>— 李俊思</p>
<p>在一陣凄凄的冷雨後，氣候顯然是突然轉冷了，尤其是到了晚上，街頭的風，飄起袍角，刮在身上、不由自主的打了幾個寒噤，深深地覺得在夏天令人望而生畏的棉袍是可愛了，又微微地感到薄了。　　在滿街的燈光中，女人的頭頸似乎是短了一截的深深地埋在大衣的皮領中，男人們也好像是頸中生着不能見人的疔瘡般的圍上了圍巾，甚至翻起了大衣的高領，就是不，大家也下意識地籠着手，縮着頸，防阻那寒風的侵佔，祇有那黄包車夫之類，依然是迎着寒風，噓着熱氣，拉着岸然的人們，大踏步的向前衝去，好像他們生來是没有感覺而不知冷和熱的。</p>
<p>隨着寒風，急促的，尖厲的賣晚報聲充滿了街頭巷尾，使人會驀然地意識到生活的悲哀。　　走過一家典當的門口，望進去，只見雪亮的燈光下，密的鐵欄和高的櫃臺外，肯門貯立着幾個憔悴的人們，不知是在質當衣服。還是在贖取衣服，究竟是爲了衣？還是爲了食？不過，無論是當贖，但總是一樣的可憐！</p>
<p>黄昏的情調，是越顯得落寞，蕭瑟了，祗有幾家百貨公司的收音機在唱着各種迎合低級趣味的滑稽歌曲，「也是生活壓榨出來的聲音呵！」我想着。</p>

<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂</p>
<p>歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>趙自强不聲不嚮的，走過去擰了一把手巾，雙手遞給桂枝。桂枝低聲笑着喲了一聲道：這可不敢當。你别客氣，我來洗得了。他已經是把衣服換好了，這時將兩隻小袖子高高的捲起，露出兩隻白而且圓的手臂，拿了手巾，就站到梳妝檯邊洗起手臉來。趙自强站在身後含着微笑着看了一陣，然後將梳妝檯抽屜裏的香胰子，雪花膏，香粉，胭脂膏，一樣樣的拿出，在檯面上擺着。桂枝笑着向他道：我的先生，你那懂這些讓我自已來罷。趙自强笑道：你今天累了，我得伺候伺候你。桂枝向房門口看了一看，見門簾子是垂了下來的，這就道：你也累了呀，我不該伺候伺候你嗎？自强笑道：不敢當。不過你眞願意伺候的話……桂枝。伸手握住了他的嘴道：這就够啦，别向下說了。自强順勢握住了他的手，就亂聞了一陣，因爲聽到外面屋子裏，有了趙翁的咳嗽聲，這才悄悄的走開了。但是他也不願意走開，走到床邊，看到雪白的床毯，一床淡青和粉紅的綢被，覺得那顏色是格外的調和。那四個白套子繡小朶紅花的枕頭，也就格外的引人，於是倒要床上靠了枕頭躺着，微嘆着氣笑道：我眞不免英雄氣短，兒女情長了。桂枝依然洗他的臉，没有作聲。趙自强於是拉了一隻枕頭在懷裏摟着，用鼻子只管在枕頭上嗅個不斷。桂枝道：你這是怎麼了？發了瘋了嗎？趙自强笑道：你剛才說了，一輩子說是這一回的事，這新婚剛過的日子，呌着蜜月，你不知道嗎？（二三四）</p>
<p>。於是他們的目光，專移向於西書和各種教科書了。他們也改稱了舊書店，北四川路，卡德路，西門都有。書的價錢，眞不便宜。我曾經買一本「歐美短文彚集，」並且是翻板的，原價三元半，兩元半纔成交。又去買一部「政治學大綱」，這書出版好久，有此過時，原價一元半，一元成交。</p>
<p>現在的舊書店，交易以西書爲大宗，因此不注意到中國的古籍。你要到舊書店購買這種書籍，眞是難覓。卽使是有，價錢也很可觀咧！</p>
<p>上星期日，我偶然走到老西門口。在路旁的舊書攤上，翻閱片刻，却發見了幾部手鈔本：一是「歐陽文忠公文集」，字迹很端整，硃墨圈點殆遍。一是「杜子美的詩選」，字迹不工，却有評語。是「五代賦選」，字好，選錄也精審。幼還有一本賦是署着「顧麟」的名字，我竟知道這位老先生是何代何地人？這四部書想必是冷門貨，無人顧問，所以他以八毛錢賣給我。</p>

<p>程元是照例穿着一件已脱了幾顆鈕扣的駱駝絨袍子，和一件已發了暗綠色的直貢呢馬褂，低着一顆滾圓的腦袋，正在津津有味地吃着他日常的晚餐。｜一碗羅子（肉丁）麵。　　「小李，當心，那橙子是有水的！别髒了你的皮大氅」｜吳豹軍帶着一種憐惜的意味向李雲警吿。的確，李雲眞是穿得太講究了，站在這些傢具和這兩個先到的客人的中間，眞像是一頭鳳凰。　　「老吳，今天大除夕，你怎麼有工夫上這裏來談天呢」？李雲知道程元是一個出名的窮小子，他差不多整天孵在這個龍虎雜誌社裏，有時就躺在那些舊雜誌堆上過夜，所以李雲對他並不注意：而認爲吳豹軍的在座上出現，是非常詫異的。因爲平常報紙不停刋的日子，老吳尙且鬧得花天酒地，不得空閒，何况這個大除夕明天照例是没有報紙的，何以他顚倒收束起了呢？</p>
<p>「哈哈！你的日子正是過得太舒服了！惟其因爲今天是大除夕，區區才上這裏來呢」！說着老吳已從他那一襲破舊的大衣袋裏掏出了寸許厚的一疊發票來，向李雲一晃，李雲這才明白了。</p>
<p>「可憐的脚色」！李雲暗暗在笑他。因爲他自已平時雖跟吳豹軍同樣的在過着荒唐奢侈的生活，却因環境，竟從不曾嘗過大除夕被索帳者包圍的苦味。　　其時，程元的羅子麵已連湯水全吃完了，正在數着十幾個已撫摩得起了熟光的銅元。</p>
<p>「阿二，你替我塡上三個銅元吧，明天準還你」！他向那個面有菜色的茶房半像請求，半像命令似的揮着手。　　「連前天一共是七個了」！阿二不很高興地收去了碗箸，勉强接受了程元的要求。　　李雲望着他微微一笑，隨乎丢了一個鴨肫肝給他。</p>

<p>大除夕又到了。</p>
<p>這裏所說的大除夕，還是舊歷的十二月三十夜，因爲革命儘管成功，守舊如命的中國人的老習慣，到底還是革不掉的。　　約莫十二點鐘模樣，照例人山人海地喧鬧着的Ｎ路上，有兩架鋼絲包車一前一後地在向西滾動。</p>
<p>「老程，對不起！今天全破了你的鈔」！還是穿着西裝，戴着絲絨帽的李雲，在前面一架包車上回過頭來，向後面車上的程元道歉着。　　今晚，程元做東，邀李雲上快活林去吃西菜，飯後，大家原定再要去看影戲，可是因爲李雲的錢袋裏，已没有錢了，祇剩十來張勉强凑數付訖的發票，所以結果又是程元請客。程元現在已不再做稿子了，正在一位大律師那裏充帮辦。</p>

<p>贛省義務教育推行狀况、與皖省相似、其困難情形亦相類、故部定第一期實施義務教育辦法大綱、及短期義務教育實施辦法大綱、均未能積極執行、最近程教廳長出巡贛北、曾對於短期小學極力提倡、在九江時、與當地紳學各界聯合討論辦法、每期每校約需經費八十元、當塲經各團體認定舉辦者有百餘校、業已成立者約四十校、對於義教經費之籌集、教廳曾擬定原則十項、辦法四條、茲錄辦法四條如下、（一）以一村或連全村爲一個集團之單位、（二）以一集團內學齡兒童全體入學需要之學級數爲設級額、（每級以容兒童五十名計）（三）以一集團內應設學級之總費用、爲其集團所應籌之經費額、（每級以年費三百元計）（四）以一集團內能生產之人民、各依財力大小、分别負担前項經費、（每人應攤之負担、最多不得超過歲入百分之五）但村或連合村內原有公共欵產租息可以撥用者、應儘以撥用、」民衆學校之設置與推行、尙未有整個計劃、惟教廳擬定二十二年度改進本省教育實方案中、關於改進方針、有下列數條、（一）盡量利用原有教育機關、辦理民衆學校、由原有教員及高年級學生、（限於中等以上學校）負教學之義務、（二）普及識字教育、應先就省會劃區辦理、逐漸推行於各縣、期於五年之內、凡百户以上之鄉村、均能實行、查該省現有民衆學校、爲數不多、而於識字運動之推進、每不能提起學生興趣、或求方法之改進故成績不甚顯著、</p>
<p>七，女子中等教育之現狀</p>
<p>及推廣辦法</p>
<p>贛省女子中學、全省公私立者共有十校、省立女高中班、全省僅南昌有一所、教會設立者、在南昌有葆靈、在九江有儒勵、省立女子職業學校、原設染織及應用化學二科、自二十二年度起、教廳擬加以下列二項之改進、（一）應分設縫紉·織巾·織襪·織布及刺繡等科、招收小學畢業生、年限以一年至二年爲原則、（二）家政科實際上至感需要、該校下學年應籌設家政科、注意家庭衛生·保姆·食物·醫藥常識等、招收十五六歲以上之初中生、除上列十校外、臨川有私立女子手工藝學校一所、設針織·刺繡·織席等科、年有縣費補助數百元、惟規模殊小、以全省論、女子中等學校、似感不足、且因匪災關係、女子中等學校之設立、多偏於贛北、依地域論、似不平均普遍、此則贛省教育之在現在特殊狀態下之特殊情形也、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>說謊的衰落（Ｔｈｅ　ｄｅｃａｙ　ｏｆ　ｌｙｉｎｇ），這是唯美者淮兒特的一篇以對話來寫出的論文題目。他詆毁寫實主義，追懷古昔的美的虛幻世界，以爲說謊．造謠的這種藝術，至近代而衰落盡了，所以他的同時代的作家，和稍古一點的曲法前輩，一個個都受了他的警句的嘲弄。他說美國人的没有好文學創製出來，就因爲他們的開國元勳的不知道說謊。華盛頓斧砍櫻樹的那一個傳說，就是窒塞殺美國人的創造本能的一種毒素。　　淮爾特的這種寄矯的見解，究竟對與不對，已經有許多文藝批評家暢論過了，我們暫且不去管牠。回頭來一看我們中國古今來的文人，覺得在說謊造謠的藝術上，的確要比西洋人落後得多。成王剪桐葉爲圭，戲封叔虞，是何等有趣的雅事，而周公認眞，最好的一個謊，就被拆破。趙高指鹿爲馬，也是一個好玩意兒，但背後要加以刑誅，謀成實用。趣事就變成惡事了。　　到了現代，這說謊的藝術，更加變得惡劣到了極頂，新聞記事，每因說謊而露出馬脚，小刋物的造謠說謊，惡劣當然更甚。不說别的，就說關於我個人的記事罷，有一個刋物，剛說過我在杭州奔走於三四流政客之門，鑽營牽拍，得了一個三十元一月的報屁股編輯；同時另一個刋物，却又說我在對雪賦詩，悠閒風雅到了無以復加；爲求這說謊話的像煞是眞起見，這位先生，還自絞腦汁，替我做了好幾首新又不新，舊又不舊的很有獨創性的詠雪詩。你想一般造謠的藝術，衰落到了如此的地步，中國的民族，還能創造得出大作品碼？</p>
<h3 id="c263">藝術卽人生論 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 林徽音</p>
<p>在新文學不必再在應付舊文學一方面用力的時候、新文學自已嘗形成了兩大派别：（一）呌做爲藝術而藝術，（二）爲人生而藝術。　　爲藝術而藝術的一派說，創作藝術就只爲它是藝術，决不是爲了什麼别的目的；還有一派，爲人生而藝術派，却說，藝術不只是爲藝術，是在改善現狀，或者推進社會。可是，雖然那兩派有一時嘗不稍退讓地爭執過來，現在已變成了過去，已不再顯示絲毫的爭執的痕跡了。而且，雖然偶或還給什麼人提一提，這爲藝術而藝術與爲人生而藝術的兩個派别似乎已不再明顯地對立着。　　可是，現在所要說的，並不是那兩派過去有過怎樣的糾紛，却是創作藝術决不能只爲藝術。創作藝術是爲人生，却不一定像爲人生而藝術派所說的爲一般的人生，是爲創作者自已的人生。　　是的，創作者的創作就是創作者的人生的一部分。　　現在且就文藝說，一個小說家的寫了一篇小說，拿到什麼地方去發表，或者刋行，他的目的總是不在名，就在利，或者，至少，在藉此發洩他的心中的鬱悶，或者氣憤。總之，他的所以寫它無非爲要由此滿足他自已的某一個欲望，所以，那不能不是他的人生的一部分。卽使他寫了，他並不發表，而把拕撕了，或者燒了，或者把它藏在泥土中，那也是他的一種人生，因爲他那樣做也是在求滿足他的一個欲望。　　爲名，爲利的小說家不將不成其爲小說家？不，那是没有不成其爲小說家的理由的，要是他的小說是一篇好的小說，是他自已的心血的結晶，是能感動人的有力量的作品。我們就知道「人間喜劇」的作者巴爾扎克有許多著作全是因爲要還債才逼出來的，但那並没有妨害他的著作的藝術的價値。　　所以，作品要就本身看它的好或壞，被寫的動機要名或者在利是没有多大的關係的：而且創作者的創作的動機總是有所在的，卽使不一定在名或利，因爲那不能不是他的人生的一部分。</p>

<p>下雪的天，想到了家。</p>
<p>破浪似的心，没法安排。憂鬱的眼睛，瞅着窗外的雪花，一片一片的往下飛。生命，像飛下來的雪花。流浪的夢，迷了的青春的路，孤獨的跋涉在這灰暗的人生道上。又是二年多没回家了。這已到深冬的時分，身子悽悽的冷，心也悽悽的冷！就是想：家鄕的雪，該是一大片一大片的下着，把大地全蓋得潔白的了。　　我愛家鄕的雪，家鄕的雪藏有我幼年的春。　　然而，家鄕的雪，於今渲染了殷紅的血！該不要輕輕地忘記那個失去了的自由的家呵！　　不能不說是一回傷心的事吧，自從九一八那天起，家是破了，家裏的人是流亡了，於是我慢慢地把家忘却了！便帶着生命的力開始踏着堅步，走向前進的路程上去。　　心是熱烈的，又在憧憬於未來的光明！　　有時，心在微笑而叮嚀的私語：快跟着歷史的輪子轉，轉到新的階級上去！　　於是，我在新生了。　　我没有家。我到處流浪。我認定一個方向。　　孤獨地嘗到了不少的人生的苦味；這人生的旅途，又是多麼長而遠呢！　　常常受到一點小小的刺激，就怠慢了自已的前進力，這是我的絕大缺點！然而，我可時時刻刻地記着人是要往前走才能够生活呵。　　自已已經鍜鍊成一個過慣異2生活的人了。可是同時也變成一個憂鬱的人了；春天我没有笑，夏天我没有笑，秋天我更是没有笑。冬天我便瞅着窗外的雪花增上一片愁緒！　　每當一個深冬來了，我的心就得遭遇一次沉重的病，更對着白雪悽然！　　現在，我所客居的青島冬深了，我的心也沉重的病了！我不禁對着這初雪唱了一回輓歌。　　於是，我想到了家。　　家呵，是已沉淪在成了「滿洲國」的東北了！東北的深冬呵，該是多麼美麗的雪的世界！</p>
<h3 id="c265">緬甸人給我的印象 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>由野人山脚的小田壩，直赴八募的道中，駕駛搭客汽車的緬甸人，突然停下車子，跳進路旁林中去了。做什麼呢？旅客們睜着好奇的眼睛一看，呵，原來是那位緬甸人因給林間的蟬聲打動了，在怪有興趣的找尋着嗚咽的蟬子哪。　　這是我對緬甸人第一次的印象，雖是平常得很，但却使我深深地注意着，至今猶未忘去，那時是在一九二七年的春天。（如果就緬甸而言。那是没有什麼春天的，只應該說是乾季吧）。我到一個地方，總愛研究那些異鄕人的性情的，而且喜歡把先前接觸過的人，拿來兩兩比較，覔出他們的差異來。因爲這是旅行的快擽，｜我高興這樣做的。　　我覺得緬甸人是要比中國民族年青些，孩子那樣好玩的脾氣，頗帶得濃重的。在曼德里（緬甸舊京城），在仰光，我就見過，倘如街巷之間，有幾個緬甸青</p>
<p>年閒走着，那未，一面唱着一面拍手的娱樂事情，是並不難於碰見的。至於馳在巿上的公共汽車，給乘坐的緬甸人，從窗上伸出手來拍打着，喧嘩喊呌的愉快情形，有時也會在綠蔭覆着的街邊一瞥地閃現，引起了遠方旅人的驚訝和微笑來。　　我們中國人呢，可不這樣，總常常是莊動的，沉靜的。卽使在最愉快的時候，像過舊歷的新年，也還是没有怎樣的放懹縱歌，盡興玩耍的狂態。一般人，尤其是鄕間的農民，倒反而在元旦日，弄得衣冠楚楚，變成文縐縐的了。大概今日的內地農家，門前還貼有這樣的春聯吧，！「逢人盡作衣冠客，到處皆成揖讓風」。可不是新春的很好的寫照麼？</p>
<p>在緬甸，我是遇着過幾個緬甸新年的，那愉快的日子約在陽曆四月中的光景。你想，那些富有孩子脾氣的緬甸人玩些什麼呢？嚇，他們麼，提着水桶，拿着水瓢，羣集在街頭巷尾，見着衣著新衫的人，不管男女，不分老幼，兜頭就給你一瓢冷水撲來，接着再而三，三而四的，直使你馬上變成一隻落水狗的慘樣子。倘如坐在電車汽車裏，水也會從窗上飛了進來。這些日子（只有三天）到處都飛舞著水花，揚溢着嘩笑的，緬甸人全樂得像瘋了一般。　　回到中國來，主常常覺得週遭一切，太沉悶了，太古老了，年青的少狀的血液，總須得打上了一針的。</p>
<h3 id="c266">故鄕夢 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>年來，夢的種類也逐漸的繁多起來了，然而在我這些夢中，却很少是關於故鄕的。以往雖也做過不少關於故鄕的夢，不過那已是幼年的事。　　夢到故鄕最多的時期，是在離故鄕不久的一二年中，所夢的不外疼愛自已的那些長輩，和外面所享受不到的物質的滿足。醒來後就嚷着要回故鄕，甚至哭泣。</p>
<p>日子再久了些，外面的生活過慣了；故鄕的夢也就和故鄕的惓戀樣的减退下來。雖有時也還做，但所夢到的故鄕，却已點綴了汽車馬車，連故鄕的街道都是柏油的了。　　當我把這類夢告知父親時，他啞然了：實則故鄕是連黄包車都還未曾有，他惄然的太息了一聲：　　「你把家忘了，你離得太長久了，一個人不宜忘本…」　　於是我在那年冬天返了故鄕。　　結果是我没住滿二星期就離開了故鄕。從此我也就不大做關於故鄕的夢了。也許偶然做到這類夢，但都不能引起我悠悠之感的。夢裏的故鄕一切都是粗俗的，陳舊的，路也不平，（比現實的故鄕還要不平多了的路。）醒後就頹然不快，甚至羞於回想。　　人本來如此，社會的進化也正唯人能如此，社會的進化是矛盾的循環。在憊疲了車輪的轉動及巿𠪨的囂喧後，我又開始夢起故鄕來。故鄕在我夢中靜靜的開展着：碧樹，水流，原野，喈喈的鳥鳴！故鄕是美麗的了。　　故鄕現在大概已是掩蓋在白雪下了吧，我想當故鄕眞的擺在我眼前時，一定是失望的，但是我决定再返故鄕了。人生本是矛盾的欺騙，人說：「人生的目的本非在目的，而在進程中。」那末，在歸途上，我想總可以滿足故鄕給我的願望的。</p>

<p>— 高植</p>
<p>連弟聽着這話更加有一點兒妞妮了。</p>
<p>「三嬸媽，到這地步，就難說了。也是没有法子喲。連弟上燈。」　　「如今這個世界就不能那樣說了，現在年頭不對了。我們的太太還是三房養的呢，不也是有福享嗎？在公館裏，名份上輩子就小一點兒，日子總過得好，穿吃使用，没一樣少的」。　　連弟聽不懂，便去上燈了。她感到幾分新鮮，覺得媽進城燒香，帶來了稀客，眞是難得。　　没有燈罩的小瓶式火油燈的火頭冒起了一大縷黑烟。燈光却很微弱。封塵的鍾馗盡像的中堂黑得只像一塊舊紙，人的影子糢糊地映在牆上。秦大娘和三嬸媽低語着。　　秦大娘的神秘的氣色使連弟覺得有點稀奇，連弟也奇怪爲什麼三嬸媽也是鬼鬼崇崇的。她只看見三嬸媽一個側面。她有着城裏人的精明神氣，穿得整齊，耳垂下的金耳環閃着可愛的光，比起秦大娘來，她是風光得多了。　　「連弟這樣子眞秀氣。連弟，三嬸媽說你有福氣，你記着。」　　三嬸媽微笑着看連弟。連弟才十七歲，由于各種農事和家事的操作，身體發育的很好。原來是很結實的身子，近來在飢荒中熬得太久，變瘦了。面貌生得好，圓圓的臉蛋兒上帶着少女的天眞和嬌羞，玉花村的少年們稱呼她「花大姊兒」，近來雖然瘦，倒反顯得苗條了。三嬸媽想若是再穿吃都好起來，過一陣，可不是要變成美人兒嗎？　　連弟聽着，覺得手足不知所措了，細長眉毛下一雙有神的眼羞得微微要閉，靦覥地一扭身，走到黑暗的小房裏去了。　　她眞捨不得她的女兒離開她，可是留她在鄕下餓死嗎？捨不得又怎辦呢？她不禁向三嬸媽訴苦了，說日子一天一天更難過，往常總是靠地下收的，可是一年不如一年，地下收的總不够生活，「三嬸媽，我們靠地是再也靠不住了，呌我們再靠佂麼呢？」　　「聽說要放賑麥呢，可是不知道要到什麼時候。」　　「要放下來才能算數呢。早發下來，我的女兒就不走了。再要等，不是等着餓死嗎？」　　「秦大娘，你靠連弟吧。朝日後看吧。」　　晚上，在三嬸媽面前，連弟感到很不安。她心裏想：爲什麼三嬸媽總是看我呢？看我作什麼？媽也有點兒神情異常，有什麼心事嗎？爲什麼又想說又不說，又像高興又像不高興呢？爲什麼三嬸媽臉上總是笑？連弟不明白，也想不透。　　秦大娘囁嚅了幾次，才吃吃地說：　　「連弟，你明天到城裏去借米，跟三嬸媽一道去。」　　這意外的消息使連弟十分高興，她抬起頭興奮地說：　　「媽，借多少？借多少？我去，我去。」　　連弟的歡喜是秦大娘意料中的事，但她不得不把三嬸媽的話說出：　　「儘你一個人挑。能挑三斗就是三斗，五斗就是五斗。進了城不要性急，人家的米不是放在那里等我們去吃的。要聽三嬸媽的話，過三天五天也不要緊。有了米就回來。」　　「媽，我能挑六斗，你看，我挑一担稻還能走。」連弟有點兒得意忘形了。　　「儘你一個人挑就是了。可不要把自已壓倒了。」　　「好，好。」連弟心裏想，若是挑回來一担，那才好啦。但　一布搭璉也很可觀了。　　連弟因爲她娘的話而笑，她娘和三嬸媽因爲主意售出而笑。連弟看她們一邊笑，一邊看她，尤其是三嬸媽的那付銳利的眼睛，好像要從她臉上找出佂麼似的，她怕髮邊髮裏的一個小疤和　　處耳輪上邊的一粒黑痣被三嬸媽窺見，便羞澀地偏過了頭，感到不安了。　　三嬸媽睡後，連弟低聲把對於三嬸媽的好奇處都問了她娘，她娘說三嬸媽進了城，走了運，發　　身了。連弟用豔羨的口氣低聲說：</p>

<p>昨日粉巿上午開盤後、各月份均見昂俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續漲六七角左右、坎拿大漲三四角左右、兼之本月份祇有一天交易、多空雙方、傾軋甚烈、多頭則預備收貨、逐步提高、空方則大多數預備交貨、不願放價抵進、因此巿面雖見步佳、交易並不甚暢也、迨至下午開盤、本月份形勢、依然激昂、最高曾提至二元二角二分半、惟過此最高峰、旋則步呈回軟、以外行多頭放手、回落一分、遠期則內地廠家、略有出槍、亦見鬆動、結果本月份較前日漲一分七厘半、二月份好七厘半、三月份好一分、四月份好七厘半、五月份好一分、六月份好七厘半云、</p>

<p>昨日期麥巿面、上下午開盤後、各月份依然沉寂之至、因結賬日近、本外埠之買賣、故從事結束、雖洋麥屢有變動、巿况竟平靜如常、全日祇二六兩月尙有做開、餘均空拍、結果二月份未動、六月份較前週六好六分、</p>

<p>車夫與肩運夫復起爭執</p>
<p>滬南各粳因之續提五分</p>
<p>滬南昨各帮來源三十餘號、（近五千石）、巿况以閘北爲碼頭工人爭業相持、致北巿同業悉數罷巿、故爾此間形勢帶緊、惟實際仍屬平常、祇售方似有抬高之意、結果如常帮蘇同等粳、行情續提五分、至於青角松江西練晚稻、零胃猶屬淡泊、所賴南北洋客帮包胃較能暢辦、續有二千餘包、巿形頗佳、價升半尺、而杜尖洋等花色平平、陰變元無甚軒輊、　　滬北昨晨九時許、少數同業開斛、小車夫正在工作、肩運夫突行爭奪、雙方互相冲突、致遭流血、受傷數人、同業此不能開斛、故相繼停止營業、以防發生意外後經公安局派警維持、各行等待米公會解决後、方可照常、故無巿報吿、</p>

<p>行販不肯輕脱</p>
<p>昨日客秈閘化愈活、本客各帮以閘帮辦、行情步高、以致不能措手、泉州帮亦未竸爭、故巿上乃被省帮獨帮暢辦、但行販以近日來源不旺、產價步昂、在陰歷年內到頭難湧、故多數擯守不出、巿面愈見緊張、昨巿秈元各米一律續漲角外、全巿開出四千五百包左右、本街祇去機靖百餘包、其餘統爲閩省帮辦去、後巿尙在看好、因閩帮去胃尙宏、卽以福州一帮而論、已可左右巿面、尙有泉州各路亦須繼續問津、故巿面與人心均有上展之望也、</p>

<h3 id="c284">談减租運動 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>對於上海生活稍微有點經騐的人，一定會感到房租問題是他全部生活壓迫中最吃重的一項。每天拼了血汗去換三角到五角洋鈿的工人，雖然住的是污穢不堪，密如鴿籠的平民窟，但每月還是要化兩隻洋拼半個舖位，化三隻洋分半個閣樓或亭子間。每月收入五十元左右的小職員，他的房租開支就難以少到十元以下，有百元左右收入的自由職業者，他的房租担負總在三十元上下。房租的開支，估去以上各種人全部收入四分之一以上，所以他們不但要爲房產主人多滴血汗，而且經常要爲了房租問題而展轉呻吟。至於在政治上下台的要人或生財有道的巨商腹賈，則有的自已會購置房屋，有的月支一百，八十兩的房租，不過等於㧞九牛之一毛。房租問題對於這些「人上之人」，却是滿不在乎的。</p>
<p>因爲房租的收入是利息較大而很穩當，所以凡屬資本家，官僚，及各種海上寓公之羣，都透過子錢孔，集中視缐於地產事業，在百業蕭條的社會現狀下，造成地產事業之投資最踴，獨向繁榮的畸形現象。　　地產主人或大房東用「科學方法」剝削二房東，二房東用「上海老門檻」剝削三房客，中間還夾着經租賬房那一批「伸手大將軍」，想出「小租」，「挖費」，「開門費」種種花樣，從上海居民身上刮取油水。經租賬房擺出比收巡捕捐一樣的氣燄來威臨二房東，而二房東又擺出一副最不衛生的面孔來對付三房客。於是，巿民大衆日瘦，大房東日肥，中間的爪子層和二房東的收入，也是大有可觀。</p>
<p>因爲上海的「住」的問題是最畸形而「門檻」最複雜，所以無論是租最近建築的，有衛生設備的新房子或租房價較低的老房子，都成爲很大的困難。租新建的房子，十九是照銀子計算，至少也是三十五兩以上，一押一租一裝修，非二三百元就不能問津。房價略低而最近不會翻造的老房子，中間一定夾着原住老房客的一層大剝削。那除了幾盞電燈而外别無所有之所謂「裝修」，竟有開口要五百，八百元之「頂費的」。地點在商業中心的巿房，小租動　論千，挖費多至　萬。房租旣貴，　規旣多，那房捐也就跟着重大不可思議。南京路一樂天的常年另捐，今年加到七千五百元，仝羽春加到六千二百四十元。這種蔚爲世界　觀的房捐數字，我們眞不能不承認其爲旣「偉」且「大」了！　　「羊毛出在羊身上」，那些出大價錢支付挖費，頂費，小租，房捐，房租的人，絕無自掏腰包之理，結果當然是把一切損失轉嫁於上海平民，吃虧的還不是小巿民和勞苦大衆？</p>
<p>上海房租地價的逐年飛漲，當然是不完全由於資本家的操縱而還有其他的原因。其一，是國內的戰亂與破產，使富人和窮人往都巿集中的趨向更加急劇，前者間接增加了地產業之投資的來源，後者增加了上海社會之住宅的需要。其二，是近年來以大刀闊斧的精神刮地皮而私囊充盈的偉人比從前增加，他們心目中最「安全」的地帶，除了美國瑞士香港大連而外，就是上海的「大英地界」或「法蘭西地界」，他們不但造私宅自已享福，而且造了許多的弄堂新邨來「爲社會服務」！</p>
<p>物極必反．房租的担負壓迫着上海最大多數的巿民，至於呼吸困難，所以最近减租運動，已由普遍的空氣而蔚爲廣大的行動。上海各團體减房租的宣言說：「居不能安，業不能樂，不特一家一店之不了，誠全巿各家各店之同一不了，而因無法生存，來自因地貧瘠之區，取得上海房客資格者，更屬不了也」。這簡直不是訴苦，而是上海巿民血涙混凝的慘號！</p>

<p>— 承章</p>
<p>不知怎的，我自已也猜不透！近日兒來，心老是感到一種說不出來的甜快！</p>
<p>有時候，她們嘮叨的說我做新嫁娘了。整天的維擁住了他，不再會和伊們遊玩！却又會一陣子的一股熱力直衝上了耳根，怪噪起來！促狹的，伊們還是的調說我：臉非紅哩，像個大柿子餅！　　眞的，我害羞也感着興奮！我想起了他，一個可愛的影子兒！我的辰哥！不期然會偸自的笑出聲來，然而又像被人家看着了似的縮住啦！　　爲了我出嫁，媽最忙啦！也最費苦心。常是細密的替我想到我所不想到的瑣碎事件。每次都是問上了好幾遍，有時眞會被她問得煩厭起來！不過後來仔細想了。祇有母親才最赤心會愛護到。　　零星的一件又一樣，辦嫁具最足够煩心了！　　我常向媽說了的，不需得過份的太多了！待後還不是一樣可以隨行置添，現在一連起的辦上了許多後，過不多時，不適時啦。拋棄了，反不値得！　　我們祗需要一個充分甜快的家庭組織。辰哥說商。　　那麼你永遠都不會變心？我試探，又像不放心！　　我祗愛着你的。辰哥看了你的臉，就會歡喜！我不知道什麼喚做變心？　　眞的，他全眞心！一樣他像我誠實，不會說着慌；而且整個的眞誠的心，保住了！自然，他是個孩子！孩子就不會在愛人跟前佯說出了慌的。　　我就歡喜他，也就更愛憐着他！　　偶然的碰到了。我們談起了家庭的裝飾設備，和房間應用的傢具。他主張用奶油黄色的抽木器具。我却喜歡會是一律的漆白的！清潔又美觀。　　討論的結果，是他的勝了，理由是：　白的　　　　單　了上同樣的，　奶黄的清潔中不會感到單調的缺美；并且仍舊是那麼的美觀，好看！　　這樣，他就笑了！因爲得到了人勝利啦。不然的，啫起了那個嘴唇兒，眞好看！像個頑皮的孩子，吃不到心愛的煻果，同樣地不稱心！　　我說了。我們的進益，要有一定支配的預算；不可以超過了進益以外的化用！尤其該留着相當的一部份來，整備子女的教育金，另外，我們也需得有適宜的娱樂，調濟生活整天的疲勞！相當的，每個星期上午，踱着公園，清靜的景緻，會影響着一個好的情感的！下半天，該儘量暢遊了，看影戲，或是留着在家裏，唱着歌，聽着歌，都是最好的娱樂！　　辰哥應許了我。買一架大鋼琴，和一架無綫電收音機。　　我眞快活的抱了他的臉吻！他笑了。說我是一個天眞的孩子，較着他自已的小妹妹更可愛。　　後來，我又說我要練着吹口琴，怪好的一件音樂，定須學會了！　　呵，那可他不許啦！因爲不十分好的身子，很容易傷壞了急促的肺部的一部分的！　　所以，我没有吹口琴，每天都祇踏琴。有時眞曾按得那個手批兒發腫得麻痛起來！但是依舊還改不去了那興奮的慣習。　　可是，這幾天就不時常踏啦。忙急另外的那個原因，當然我自已知道，别人也會猜到的！　　昨天，惠姊就問了我。爲什麼没有興緻按琴了！敢是你辰哥不許你按了，那麼腫的手！可是！　　不好意思的回答，祗報了她一個紅臉！　　日子祗會的近攏來，心會更跳動得利害。快活的心急？害羞的嬌熱？我再說不出！</p>

<p>— 雯</p>
<p>每逢春秋二季各學樣開學的時候，我常從各報的分類廣吿欄看到聘請教員的廣吿，標價二百元聘大　　　留學生教授的，固然不是没有，　破　十元十五元的「車費」聘請「半盡義務」，「膳宿自備」之小學或初中教員的，却是觸目皆是。又據自知認識的朋友之中，竟有每月拿二十元代價，教算術英文，每週授課十四小時以上的。此外，許多私立中學校，教員的待遇，多半是每小時五角，七角，至多一元。如果有一位「老板」創辦中學，拿每小時一元二角的代價請教員，許多墮饑餓綫的知識分子，簡直是「只愁搶不到手」！　　我又從女聲半月刋上面，看到一節「　傭待僱」的介紹，該「陳媽」每月的工資，也開價到七八元。　　以上最普遍而慘酷的事實，至少說　　　　　　　　　有這　　年　長衫失業工人」的恐慌已達到極點，許多竟求「特别平沽」而找不到僱主；其二，有一批「熱心教育」的私立學校的老板，是以剝削窮教員的腦汁和血汗爲其「生活方式」；其三，許多小學校聘教員的待遇，並不在二三等的公館僱老媽子之上。</p>
<p>大批長衫失業者的充塞社會，自然是社會蕭條，凡百破產的必然結果。在絕無軌道的時代趨勢的方式之下，旣有（一人成佛，鷄犬皆仙」的珔面，當然就如以由都巿以至農村的普遍不景氣，　時險地在把固有的長衫同志，排月到機關，學校，商店，公司的大門以外。而</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>多　拿到大學或中學畢業文憑的「新實衫工太」之捱不到一點空隙，自屬當然之事。</p>
<p>新舊長衫失業者的壘積，幾乎成爲踵肩相接的「人山」，這人山點綴了各大都巿，成爲觸目驚心的社會癌　。　　這大批的長衫失業者往那裏去？自然只有前進和開倒車的兩條路，旣不能長此徘徊歧路，也不曾有一條不偏不倚的「中庸之道」。</p>
<p>願意前進，應　把握世界與中國的眞正動向，從爭取民族獨立精神和平民福利中找出路。在個人生活方面，除了設法解决職業問題而外，還得力求生活的政治化。　　願意開倒車，那問題就更簡單，脱下了「清高」的外衣，老老實實當舊社會勢力的爪子，縱然不能名揚凌烟閣，至少也不失爲千古狗譜中的一隻標本。　　總之，長衫失業者不應該長此悲觀自歎，不應該長此徘徊中路，應該一面爲職業而努力，一面認取自已之何去何從的前途。站在龍爭虎鬥的戰爭舞台上幻想中立，是最蠢而難免被「夾攻」的！</p>

<p>— 禱</p>
<p>有一天來了一位客人，他將南京在等工作的「災官」一種窮酸醜態描寫得滿座哄堂，可是人不禁喟然而嘆曰；「宦海浮沉，古已有這，不料於今尤烈！」　　客曰：「你知道在南京等工作的災官有多少人？一萬八千多！有的住小旅館，有的寄食在朋友親戚的門下，生活的窮困痛苦，只有天曉得！可是他們的生活任是怎樣的窮困，衣服總是要講究的；穿中山裝的，穿軍服的，那還只是那麼一個樣子，穿長袍的就少不得一件馬褂，穿西裝的更少不得一件大衣。衣服是容貌的儀表，他們一定要講究，何况這社會是只重衣裳不重人，是不是？他們天天找朋友親戚寫介紹信，持了介紹信去見要見的人，滿口謂求栽培提㧞，態度謙下恭敬，可是結果怎樣你知道？南京的要人對於「請求栽培提㧞」的話就好像耳邊風，從左邊耳朶吹進去從右邊耳朶跑出來，一點不放在心上，而且聽得討壓了，誰願意替這一班災官安下一個噉飯地。結果，你所請求栽培提㧞的人，他却給你一封介紹信呌你去找别人栽培提㧞。你得到這麼一封要人的介紹信，以爲有了他要人的介紹，工作一定不成問題了，可是那是一張廢紙，一點效力都没有。哈哈哈，你拿了這一位要人的介紹信去找那一位要人「栽培提㧞」，那一位要人他也是慣發介紹信呌人去找别一位要人「栽培提㧞」的人，這樣，你的介紹信只是給他付之一笑。　　「難道這一位要人的面子對於那一位要人完全已經失了效力彼此心照不宣嗎？」座中有人懹疑的問着。</p>
<p>客曰：「對嗎。彼此都是慣發介紹信的人，一見面連提起都懶得說，誰曾覺得那是丢了自已面子的事。可憐這一萬八千個災官他們還蒙在鼓裏，介紹信一送上，至少滿腔塡塞了希望在家裏高興地等候消息十把來天。等你三回兩次地登門打聽，起初還只是聽着一些敷衍的話，後來連見你都拒絕了。門房常常見你這個帶介紹信來拜訪他主人的災官，一種輕視的面孔給你才難受。被主人吩咐拒絕接見的你，一到那時就好像向他門房討飯的呌化子一樣的受辱無處可申訴了。」　　「那末，到南京求差事，就根本不行嗎？」座中又有人問着。　　客曰：「那也不盡然。第一要有資本，第二要搭架子才行。」　　「求差事還要有資本，那末有資本的人還去求差事嗎？」　　客曰：「所以你是外行。有了資本，用處大着呢。送送禮物，非錢不行，</p>
<p>這是其一，其次用錢請客大吃一餐然後才有交情，有了交情那就好辦了，　　於要求辦事的人，旣送了禮物，又請吃一餐，在他的心裏就有了你的印象，以後找差事就不難。可是，萬萬不能够在送禮物與請吃餐的時候就提出栽培提㧞的話，否則就完了，他又討厭你了。」　　「這就是所謂要搭架子嗎？」　　客曰：「這是接近他的方法，還不是搭架子。所謂搭架子者，見面時絕對要擺出只是到南京玩玩的神情與態度，令他無疑。而且同時也擺出對於找差事并不在意，卽是天下各方面對你都有來往，你不願意去找差事的表現。這就是搭架子。而且又要會吹牛，什麼國際情勢，國內政治，莫索里尼，希特拉，以至於古詩宋詞小說戲劇的常識無所不通無所不曉，一吹就是長篇大論令人佩服你的淵博，這才够資格。」　　「這些步驟做了以後呢？」　　客曰：「以後就進行找差事了。可是你自已切不可以當面提起，自已提起亦是糟了，一定要托友人在他的左右身邊對你捧得天高，由他說去，這就成了。」　　客人的話，眞是可以當做求官指南。然而，求官之道，蓋亦苦矣！</p>

<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>近來過日子似乎很艱難似的，一定要想出許多方法，立下許多題目，才能把日子打發開去。這情形上過去所没有的。　　在外觀上，過去雖也有過改元易朔的事，或把年號題作「河平」，或把年號題作「嘉禾」，類似於現在的「國貨年」兒童年」等等，但實質上，則頗有不同「</p>
<p>。在先並不是先定下了「河平」的年號，才去着手平　　是出了一個「嘉禾」的題目，才去　二穗三穗以至五六穗的稻，而大都是事後「誌喜也」！　　但近來可不行，近來是像做文章一樣先生定了題目，才去過一年的日子的。</p>
<p>雖然，「一年容易又秋風」，日子還是一樣過，｜｜受難的依然受難，橫行的還是橫行，然而一般人却非需要刺激不可。必需要尋常的日子上，加上「什麼年」或「什麼週」之類，以求興奮一時。這呈以證明人心已感到異常的疲乏，再也不能忍受一種平凡的生活了。　　但執此以追求他所希冀的事事物物，也是歧道，將會墮入更大的疲乏，更無聊的境地裏去，决不會有「如願以償」的一日的。羅素曾說過「刺激的東西，如藥品，愈有就愈需要」。我們只須看到去年的所謂「國貨年」，而對外貿易全年入超數達四萬一千七百八十四萬餘元可知。一般興高采烈，多方籌備宣備的「年」或「週」，新給予人們的印象又如何？人心是早已由「疲乏」而進入「麻木了，决不是一般，標語與口號所能振起」的｜｜刺激的能否收效，原也有其客觀的條件的，而我們現在所採用的這一種刺激法，恰如吸鴉片，希圖興奮一時，或麻醉一時而已！</p>

<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>克佳似乎感覺白鵝的舉動異樣，他目光移到寫字台上，端端正正的那裏安放着一罐紙烟。　　「弟弟，你又抽烟了？」　　並不是故意作爲寂寞的開始，一個没有修養的運動家，他不能以面部表情來啓示喜怒哀樂的，他知道的是老實不客氣，尤其是對於被他稱爲小弟弟的朱效蓀，他認爲自已的命令没有取消之前理應質問。　　「抽烟？我還能喝酒哩！」　　神經質的牽動着嘴角，冷冷的像一枝袖箭。克佳笑着，不自然地笑着。　　「弟弟，我的留條見到了？」他兩手互相搓着，似乎在這舉動中可以勾引對方的答案。</p>
<p>點點頭，没有回答。　　「兩天倒底住在什麼地方？」　　身體移向前來，要是兩手凑近地板，彷彿五十碼决賽的預備姿勢。　　「山上！」　　「醫生說的。」　　「我自已的意思！」</p>
<p>那樣瀟洒的吸了最後一口烟，烟尾用成熟的手法向窗外拋去。那雙縮回來的手就在烟罐中抽出兩枝烟，一枝授給克佳，微笑着說：　　「還是抽香烟吧。」　　這等於野牛的老實不客氣。吿訴你這里可以抽烟，可是不能說話。　　白色的烟隨着青風向窗外飛散，輕輕地。　　長時間的沉默佔據着三月的空間。　　像運動塲上的落選者，克佳站起身來說：　　「上海凖定不去了？」　　「上海爲什不去？」一個笑。一個皺眉。「過了你的Wedding，我自會到上海的。」</p>
<p>「那又是什麼意思？」說着下意識地坐了下來。　　「我又將問你失戀是不是痛苦的？」美麗的笑着。可是隨卽绷緊了臉「我不願意再見勤菠」　　猜了半天謎底的野牛終於忍俊不住笑了起來，「弟弟，别發孩子氣了。前</p>
<p>天靜宜……」克住思索一下，接着說：「是前天她去訪勤菠，請她做女嬪相，已一口答應了。她還問起你能不能從杭州回來。弟弟，戀愛本是點綴人生的把戲，勤菠嫁了，不妨換一套玩玩。一個男子漢的氣量竟如此狹窄嗎？」表示他是個運動家，每一個字都滿有勁的說出來。　　效蓀掠着天然鬆曲的頭髮，忽地從寫字椅上跳起來。一隻在清溪中優遊着的白鵝，他不承認是氣量不如女子的。</p>
<p>「多說什麼！你幾時動身？」　　「明天。」　　「一同走！」天然鬆曲的頭髮在三月的春風中搖蕩。</p>

<p>— 舒湮譯</p>
<p>一九二二年是關鍵的一年了！</p>
<p>我和革命的關聯成一爲種血和骨的內心自信的事物。　　在我剏作的過程中，我是從唯理論而近於抽象而離心的「聖賢」（The　Ｓａｇｅ）｜根據沃斯儲夫斯基的喜劇而改編的，轉變到宣傳而煽動的街頭劇「聽着莫斯科」（Ｈｅａｒ　Ｍｏｓｃｏｗ）和「瓦斯罩」（Ｇａｓ　Mａｓｋｓ），以及於革命的映書「波多姆金」（Ｐｏｔｅｍｋｉｎ）之攝製。</p>
<p>和革命逐漸相接近的傾向，使藝術更深切的浸潤於戰鬥的唯物論的原素裏。</p>
<p>繼續攝製的影片和社會的要求，繼續負起發展一種「方法」用來剏造電影表情的實騐的工作，儘量的灌輸着奏效的革命的藝術，和教導的使那般第一次五年計劃裏從事於電影工作的青年們武裝起來。　　近來的中心作品如「今昔之十日」（Ｔｅｎ　Did　and　New）用意是在實騐和研究。</p>
<p>個人的工作目前和國家電影教育恊社（Ｔｈｅ　State　Instituto　Of　Cinernatogｒａｐｈｙ）所計劃的科學與教育的實騐方法完全採取一致的步驟。　　理論的著作則根據於電影藝術的基本原理。　　我造成我的人生哲學，那是完全根據着革命的旨趣，因爲革命决定着一切。</p>
<p>問題在這兒的是意識的發展要到什麼程度，而意志是不屆的。　　當我達到這樣一個階段，我决定到國外去旅行了。　　外國｜｜是一個最終的試騐，對於一個生長於十月革命的蘇維埃社會裏的公民的傳記。這是個自由選擇的試騐。　　外國｜｜是一個最終的試騐給『文化之主人們』來意識的辦别朋友和敵人。　　外國｜｜是一個最終的試騐讓剏造的工作者知悉他能否單獨創造革命和存留於革命之外。　　在好萊塢的金山前面，這試騐是發生了。那種想以非英雄氣節的姿勢來摒棄人間的嫵媚和優美的手段是被拒絕了，他們是在另一種社會情形底下，爲另　一階級的利益而工作。　　在這階級的劃分綫外來從事剏作的不可能，革命的全般權勢與能力起來了　普羅革命的壓力把橫在它道上的反抗勢力一律掃蕩無存，並且使從前曾傾向於牠的勢力拉進來而更强烈的把握住牠們。　　那就是每一個蘇聯的藝術工作者所做和所想的。　　我們中間許多人是從革命裏來的。　　我們一切的人都是以藝術的武器來參加革命的。　　　（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｃｒａｄｉｅ　Ｓｏｎｇ</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品·大光明開映</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>自從「女性」震動了影壇之後，除了那位導演石剛女士的意識形態給歐美影壇發生了珍奇的光彩之外，那一位主角桃樂姗薇克亦同時給人們深切的注意，而立刻由於派拉蒙的重聘而自德至美了</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>現在，我們看過這一影片之後，不能不使我們立刻回憶到「女性」。這不僅是由於主演者的關係，同時在故事的安排方面，亦頗有類似之處。　　「女性」，誰都知道它是宣示人類天性的自由，爲了自由，爲了人與人之間的愛，那「制服的處女」們，她們不甘忍受苦悶而本能的與壓迫者抗爭。她們那種爲自由，爲正義而奮鬥的精神，無疑的已給與了不安於現實的人們某種程度之刺激。</p>
<p>那末，這「梵音情涙」吿訴了我們一些什麼呢？宗教，精神的統治者，斷送了無數的少女之青春。她們被麻醉於那種虛無漂渺的所謂「博愛」的聖光中，而從凄凉的人間，走向天堂的地獄。在那裏，她們雖然受了神的洗禮，仍然忘不了尼庵以外的人們，她們的家，她們的兄弟姊妹，以及一切關懐她的人們。她們雖極力忍受着神之冷酷的蹂躪和摧殘，但同時也忘不了人與人之間愛的存在。於是她們自內心深處發出了微弱的解放呼聲，於是約娜親手撫養的悌里沙，終於在她們悲哀和歡樂的交流之中，逃出了那冷酷的尼庵了。　　人情的深刻描寫，微薄的宗教囚徒的哀嗚。　　很顯然這没有「女性」的熱情、但調子上却與「女性」甚爲相似。前者爲積極的，後者却恰恰相反。這裏更證明石剛女士之偉大了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>此外，特别應當提出的，那便是「搖籃歌」的作者之態度。他一方面有着反對宗教之不合理的表示，但是他也决不攻擊修道院之存在。他完全以其中庸之道，發揮他人情的常理。至於教女性們離開尼庵之後，更離開賢妻良母的範圍，那當然是我們過分要求他所不能理解的東西了。　　所以，在美國電影中，能有如此合乎情理的作品，已經是値得重視了。　　至於這一影片，完全是爲了桃樂姗薇克的個性和作風，那是至爲明顯的了。</p>

<p>數年來歌無名片之最傑出者爲聯華出品佈景新頴偉大人才薈聚羅致百老匯名伶五十餘人加入參演歌舞與情節堪稱雙絕不日將在南京開映。</p>
<p>這一影片，始終是好的作品。不僅是故事已如上述，而導演之手法，更是値得稱許。但是在這裏，我不想一點一滴的指明，所必須說到的乃是其主要的特色。</p>
<p>我們看罷，凡與此同類的故事，常常易於沉悶，然而這裏却於靜的空氣中動人情感了。這無論是音響的效果，或劇的旋律，甚至於每一個書面的構圖，都是極臻善美。就藝術之本身來說，又給我們證實了電影之偉大的眞價了。　　演得好，這應當是每一個都嘖嘖稱道的。我不想在此評論每個演員之技藝的高下，反正她們都是極力的獲得了極高的成績。不過桃樂姗薇克儘在這種個性的典型之下，發展下去，總覺不免狹窄巴。</p>

<p>— 沈白</p>
<p>（一）冬天裏的春天</p>
<p>「一二八」過了以後，在這樣嚴冬的天氣裏，加上了自身的雜亂的情緒，更感到極度的苦冷………「梵音情涙」倒給了我一些和藹的空氣。也可說是一刹那的冬天裏的春天。………　　（二）這裏是没有了黄金的特色。</p>
<p>色情，狂舞，女人的腿，「mmm………」這是一般美國片的特色，這似斜陽反照，一般的美麗。但是此片中一無所有，有的，只是人情之涙…………。</p>
<p>（三）値得我們追憶的幾點。</p>
<p>那同一調子的Follow　Shot：那以音樂來連續畫面幕間的旋律；那表示崇高的金字塔型的「Bust」的構圖；這些的綜合，使我的眼眶深處，也感到了微微的濕潤。　　註一a，在約娜跪在聖母像前冷寂的畫面上，音樂是外間西班牙熱舞的調子。　　b·在約娜孤獨地立在牆邊的時候，音樂是外面的小孩歡聲……。　　這些音響與畫面的反比對照，是値得我們記憶的。　　註二，凡是約娜的半身鏡頭，都是利用着金字塔型的構圖。</p>

<p>「爸爸！我也有！」屋角的兒子也喊了起來，他是有着一撲滿的錢。　　就是這樣，他們的布店開成了！店號是「恊興」。克儉的爸是經理，招待門巿有克儉，克</p>
<p>儉的媽把布料包起來，克儉的妻，和妹，把布疋翻給顧客看，小兒子世雄是傳遞布料和發票，這一個家庭商店是太呌人生羨了！　　恊興布店是滿蓄着生氣，許多顧客們源源地光顧着。可是，不幸得很，這正在蓬勃着的恊興，讓那猴頭刁仁看見了，他妒了，他更想起了前情，於是，也更想予克儉們一個嚴重的報復。當下，刁仁怱怱地跑回來，把一切報吿給郝新。經過他們兩個相當考慮之後，他們的辦法產生了。他們就在恊興的對面，開了一家大興布號。　　大興的門口給大紅大紫的彩布包圍着，康納脱也在門口大吹大打起來，門口的大金字吿訴人們，他們是在七折大廉價，在這七折大减價的旗幟下面，羣衆顧客們像潮水般的洶湧，熙攘，但，另一邊的恊興呢？克儉的爺兒倆，給愁悶的空氣包圍了。憤然地望着對門的熱鬧，興盛，默然的發着怔。　　「賣七折照成本要虧去一成半，怎麼做呢？但是不做，連吃用的錢都　没有了，這有什麼辦法呢？只得暫時跟他們放盤吧！」於是，恊興也賣起七折來了。但大興更賤賣起五折了。克儉的爸是窘極了，克儉也只有長長的吁一口氣。但，同時，討債者又在他們店堂裏咆哮，於是，克儉的爸的心破碎了。　　幾重的壓榨下，克儉的爸病了。同時，恊興的門口，張貼起了招盤的廣吿來。刁仁看到了這招盤廣吿，露着勝利的微笑。踱進店堂，問克儉：「實號不是要出盤嗎？」克儉露着不服氣的神秘表情在深思。「生財布貨有多少？」一方面還是奸笑地問着。可是，一方面還是不理　　「要盤多少錢呢？」刁仁又問。「一起在內，只要一千塊錢好了。克儉帶着氣忿的口吻。於是，刁仁露着奸詐的微笑退了出來。　　但，旁邊克儉的妻看得不耐煩了，他說：「難得有人來問詢，你要這麼大的價錢，把人家一下子嚇跑了·」克儉氣仇仇的道，「跑就跑了，我本來不願意盤給他。」「他，人和你不對，金錢可和你没有仇啊！你不知道家中要緊等錢用嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>(Xiamen) News from Zhangzhou: A joint meeting of the party, government, and military was held in Zhangzhou at noon on the 30th to discuss the security of Zhangzhou Prefecture. Only Hangzhou and Wu in the Fujian border area have Cantonese troops. Yongping and Zhao'an have no Cantonese troops entering. The Hangzhou and Wu troops are the original stationed troops. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has internally designated Dai Ji as the commander of the 19th Route Army. It is heard that he has been summoned by the central government and will come to Beijing soon. It is said that junior officers and soldiers in the army who are willing to be reorganized will be accepted. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Sun's Main Force</p>
<p>Fierce Attack on Ningxia City Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Has Retreated to the Fengdengpu Area</p>
<p>Rear Echelon Troops Very Busy Mobilizing</p>
<p>Wang Shiping Asks for Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>He Yingqin Cables Order to Retreat North of Dengkou</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military organization received intelligence from the front: On the night of the 26th, Sun's army launched a fierce attack on Ningxia, concentrating artillery and machine guns for bombardment. Ma's troops fought bravely in response. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Sun's troops ultimately failed. At dawn on the 27th, the 117th Division of Sun's army advanced on Ningxia City, attempting to scale the city walls from the west gate, but were repelled by Ma's defending soldiers. That evening, fierce fighting resumed at the city. Sun's troops suffered heavy casualties. The remaining troops fled to the Fengdengpu and Mandaqiao areas northwest of the city. The 118th Division of Sun's army, in the area south of Xie Juepu, was ambushed on three sides by Ma's security bureau, Ma's brigade, and Han and Lu's two brigades, suffering approximately 1,000 casualties. Sun's division commanders Liu Yueting and Ding Liting personally directed the fighting at the front lines. It is heard that the 119th Division has been urgently dispatched from Baotou westward to reinforce the troops. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At the beginning of Sun's troops' westward advance, those who created disturbances in Pingluo, Li Gangpu and other places were all bandit troops led by Yang Houxiao and others. Another main force, led by Liu Yueting, bypassed Helan Mountain from Woye and launched a surprise attack on the provincial capital of Ningxia. They attempted to scale the city walls fiercely, but were discovered by Ma's stationed troops. As a result of the fierce fighting, Sun's troops have retreated to the Fengdengpu area northwest of Ningxia City, where they are in a standoff with Ma's troops. The situation in the provincial capital of Ningxia is tense. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Wang Shiping, visited He [Yingqin], requesting the dispatch of personnel to Dengkou to negotiate the troop withdrawal. It is heard that He has agreed, but the selection of personnel has not yet been determined. Ma's representative, Bai Jianmin, is scheduled to visit He this afternoon to request instructions on measures. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin again cabled Sun Dianying on the 30th, stating that the army's organization, as approved by the sub-committee, was only one infantry division consisting of seven regiments. It has been repeatedly reported that the army is recruiting defeated soldiers and bandits, actively expanding its size. The Central Government's order to cultivate land in Qingxi has just been issued, and Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai are all appealing against it. Therefore, he ordered them to temporarily station in place. However, the army suddenly attacked Ningxia, and the people suffered from the ravages of artillery fire. Therefore, he again cabled an order to lead all troops to withdraw north of Dengkou, and to strictly reorganize according to the organization filed with the sub-committee, in order to observe future effects. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shiping visited He this morning, requesting the dispatch of personnel to Dengkou to investigate the truth. He stated that the first step must be a ceasefire between both sides. After the telegram reporting the ceasefire arrives in Beijing, the military sub-committee will send personnel to Dengkou to discuss the aftermath with Sun in person. If both sides still do not cease fire, there is no need to send personnel. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed the Central Government and Zhu Shaoliang, reporting the details of Sun's army's westward invasion and requesting instructions. Jiang [Jieshi] and Zhu telegraphed Ma, ordering him to intercept Sun. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Telegram from Guihua: He Yingqin's representative, Men Bingyue, is still in Suiyuan and has not gone to Baotou. He must wait until the Sun-Ma conflict has been negotiated before returning to Beiping. There is no intention to go to Baotou. Sun himself is currently in Baofeng, directing military affairs. The situation at the front is unclear. The rear echelon of Sun's troops is quite busy mobilizing. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A driver from Sun's army who returned to Beiping from the front stated that on the 26th, Liu Yueting transferred from Shizuishan to Pingluo. At that time, most of Sun's army was concentrated in the Pingluo Ligangpu area. Another unit was being transferred towards Ningxia. The foremost front line had already reached the Beita area on the outskirts of Ningxia City, and the military affairs were quite successful. Whether Sun's army has retreated remains to be verified. Wang Shiping was summoned to visit He yesterday. He stated that he urgently hoped that Sun would obey the order to cease his westward advance and then discuss a solution. Wang replied that there was no problem with Sun's troops stopping their advance, but to prevent pursuit, it would be difficult to withdraw the troops without a solution. Therefore, he greatly hoped that the authorities would immediately dispatch senior officials to Dengkou to invite Sun to meet and settle the matter first, which would not be difficult to resolve immediately. He [Yingqin] considered sending Ji Yiqiao to inquire, but when he will depart is yet to be determined. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) He Yingqin's representative, Hou Cheng, left Taiyuan this afternoon to return to Beiping to report. Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, and others all saw him off. According to Hou, Yan [Xishan] is still mediating the Sun-Ma war and specific measures can be determined after reporting to He. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Telegram from Zhangjiakou: Various sectors of the Ningxia public telegraphed Yan [Xishan], stating that Sun's troops' move to Woye was by order of the government. However, that area is only a few dozen li in size, and it is now the dead of winter. How can cultivation be spoken of? They requested that he treat Ningxia as he treats Shanxi and Suiyuan. Since you love Shanxi and Suiyuan, you must love Ningxia, etc. Yan replied to Ningxia, stating that Ningxia is poor and barren, and suffers frequent disasters. He has always been deeply concerned. He has already asked the central government to help plan for the resettlement of Sun's troops. As for the opening to Woye, he has also telegraphed the Suiyuan authorities to set up a nearby office to take care of Ningxia Province, just like Shanxi and Suiyuan. He will do everything possible to help. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Ruyi, Tian Jiongjin, Ma Yuanfeng, Minzhuer, and more than ten other natives of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai residing in Beijing, because Sun Dianying's troops advanced into Ningxia, causing the region to suddenly suffer devastation, petitioned the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Council on the morning of the 30th, requesting an immediate halt to Sun's troops' westward advance in order to stabilize the border. The various organizations separately dispatched personnel to meet with them, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. The Executive Yuan has already resolved to cancel Sun Dianying's land reclamation mission. A certain Shandong representative stationed in Beijing representing Sun Dianying stated that the army's westward advance was indeed a clear order from the central government. Unfortunately, it conflicted with Ma Hongkui's army, which is regrettable. Now that the central government has rescinded Army Commander Sun's order to cultivate land in Qinghai, the issue of the army's whereabouts will be entirely according to the central government's intentions. The fighting at the front ceased on the 25th. On the 29th, a telegram was received from Sun's army stating that a local conflict had occurred again. He is now quietly awaiting the central government's measures for the aftermath of the army, so that he can convey them. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) This place has just received a telegram from Wang Jialie, stating that after Chen Qizhen's troops were fiercely attacked and retreated, the situation in Guizhou has already eased. You Guocai's representative here denies that You Zeng participated in the campaign against Wang. Wang Jialie, in order to establish understanding between Hunan and Guizhou provinces, has dispatched a representative to Changsha to negotiate. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Presidium of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Conference, including Yun Wang and De Wang, telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong from Pangjiang on the 19th, questioning whether what Huang said during the Central Commemoration Week was true - that various princes supported the central government establishing autonomous regions under the provincial governments of Chahar and Suiyuan - and expressed their disapproval. On the same day, they telegraphed representatives to Beijing, telling them not to accept principles outside of the Bailingmiao decision, and to return to Mongolia together if their goals were not achieved. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian representatives Zhao Taibao and Su Dai, led by Beijing representative Wu Heling, went to the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 30th to see Secretary-General Chu Minyi, stating that they could not accept the Mongolian autonomous measures decided by the Central Political Council. Chu replied to the representatives' requests that each point could be raised for discussion at the Central Political Council on the 31st, and that the representatives' intentions would be adopted to revise the original proposal. Please wait patiently for the results of the meeting. The representatives thanked him and left. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Aftermath of the Mutinying Troops in Yutian</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the security team that mutinied in Yutian has withdrawn from Ya Hongqiao and Hongqiao Town, and is still stationed in the county seat, awaiting orders from the provincial government regarding the aftermath. On the 29th, Yin Rugeng convened a meeting with the leaders of the mutinying troops, Peng Zuyou and Hu Xie Wu, as well as representatives from the merchants of Ya Hongqiao, deciding to rename Ya Hongqiao as New Ya Hongqiao, and to dispatch the 3rd Company of the Security Team from the war zone to garrison the town. The local defense militias of the various counties remain as originally stationed. The head of the Ya Hongqiao Merchants Association, Wang Lanting, resigned due to dissatisfaction with the mutinying troops, and a new, impartial merchant will be selected to form a small merchants association to handle the aftermath. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Gu Beikou takeover issue, Yin Rugeng personally went to Gu Beikou at the beginning of this month to contact Major Ezaki, the representative of the Kwantung Army, and negotiated a draft handover agreement. After returning to Beiping, Yin brought the draft to Tianjin to visit Yu [Xuezhong], and it has been passed by the provincial government meeting. After returning to Beiping, Yin went to Yutian to investigate the conflict between the militia and the police. Today, military attache Chaisang received a telegram from the Kwantung Army urging him to press Yin to return to the Ji-Mi District Public Office in Beiping. Yin is currently in Yutian handling the aftermath of the conflict between the militia and the police. In the next few days, he will first go to Zunhua to inspect the local situation, and then transfer to Ma Lanyu to contact Captain Hirazawa Kiichi of the Japanese army to arrange the return of Ma Lanyu. After completing the matter, he will return to Beiping. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The conflict between the police and militia in Yutian has now come to an end. The special police force under Hu Xiewu is starting to reorganize in the county seat, and is still in accordance with the provincial government's approval, limited to 1,000 men. It is expected to be completed within a week, and then the provincial government will designate a location for them to be transferred for training. Yin Rugeng is currently in Yutian handling the aftermath, and will soon go to Fengrun and Zunhua counties to inspect. (Central News Agency telegram, 30th)</p>

The number of workers still on strike is approximately 26,000 to 27,000, but they are all foreign workers recruited by contractors. The local workers directly hired by the mines are still going to work daily, and the mines have not completely shut down. The situation of the foreign workers' strike has eased in recent days, tending towards a work slowdown. If the provincial government approves the resumption of labor unions and allows labor union activities, the situation will not escalate and can be resolved in a short time. The Tianjin Kailuan Mining Bureau is trying direct labor-management negotiations. On the 30th, representatives of the labor union, accompanied by British personnel stationed in the mines, arrived in Tianjin to negotiate with British General Manager Nathan Eder and Chinese General Manager Gu Zhen. The workers' representatives still presented nine demands. The mine's intention is that the workers should clarify the boundaries. Regarding the compensation for injured and deceased workers and the restoration of jobs for unemployed workers, the mine has accepted them in principle. Regarding the disbandment of the security team and the permission of labor union activities, these matters are the responsibility of the provincial government and can be addressed separately in negotiations with the authorities. The workers agreed to consider this before further discussion. On the 30th, the striking workers of the four Kailuan mines each received and wore badges issued by the labor union to show their determination not to return to work until a satisfactory result is achieved.

<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister Tang Youren stated that the TASS news report of the Lama Gal Hui people in southern Xinjiang organizing an independent government was something that they believed was untrue a long time ago, but they did not dare to make a definitive statement because they had not received a formal report. Now, according to the formal reply telegram reports from the embassy in the Soviet Union and the consulate in Tashkent, they both stated that there was no such thing. It seems to be a plot by Ma Zhongying's side, and the "Red" news agency has therefore used this to promote it. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Telegram of victory from Lichuan: The troops of Fan and Zhou who were pursuing bandits westward from Zhangcun and Hengcun again defeated the false 13th, 5th, and 9th Army Corps southeast of Xikou in Guangze on the 27th, killing many bandits and seizing thousands of guns. They are still suppressing the bandits with various local forces in Fujian. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) In recent days, there have been reports of victories in various encirclement and suppression operations. Bandit soldiers have been captured or have surrendered with their weapons, carrying the heads of bandit leaders. Refugees from the bandit areas, in groups, cross high mountains and deep valleys, braving rushing streams, fleeing to return in an endless stream, which is enough to prove that the bandits have begun to collapse. The refugees who escaped to the province from Wan'an are all emaciated and haggard. When reporters inquired about their hardships and feelings, most of them shook their heads and did not say a word or frequently called for the "listening team." The reporter did not understand the meaning at first, but later learned that the bandits had a secret organization called the "listening team" to monitor the masses. If the masses had any complaints or dissatisfied remarks, they would be killed on the spot. The people in the bandit area feared them like snakes and scorpions. Now, although they are already in a safe area, they are like startled birds, still fearful and trembling, daring to be angry but not daring to speak, which is truly tragic. When the reporter asked an old man with white hair and bones as thin as wood about his suffering, he looked up to the sky, scratched his head, swallowed his voice, and wept, answering in a miserable tone, "It is difficult to say in one word." Those who saw his tragic situation were moved to tears. A certain high-ranking military officer told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the military progress of the bandit suppression in recent days has been quite rapid and is very optimistic. The bandit forces can be completely wiped out in the near future. However, the Red bandits have plagued Jiangxi for many years, anesthetizing the masses with sophisticated and vicious methods that leave nothing unturned. Wherever they go, they burn and kill, corpses are piled into mounds, towns and villages are reduced to ruins, and fields are barren. Often there are no people for several miles, resembling a desert. When the bandit disaster is quelled in the future, handling the aftermath will be very difficult. Clearing up the remaining poison and restoring vitality will probably not be successful in a short period of time. (Central News Agency telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e22">Mussolini's Remarks on Japan and the Soviet Union <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Although Mussolini cannot attain absolute leadership in Europe, his Blackshirt theories have spread throughout Central Europe, fundamentally shaking the Versailles system. Germany, in its opposition to Versailles, cannot help but take consistent action with Italy. Hungary, Austria, and other countries, in order to maintain their own survival, also follow Italy's lead. Thus, Italy, a country small in size and with a poor population, has risen to compete with France for dominance in the Mediterranean and hegemony in North Africa. At the same time, it is extending its influence in Central Europe. If the Versailles system were to collapse and the League of Nations were to be reorganized, and if Germany's demand for equality in armaments were to be realized, then today's Italy would easily be able to expand its control over Southern Europe and go on to dominate the entire continent. However, looking at the current situation, France possesses more than 80 billion francs in cash and also sits atop the world's leading air force. No matter how strong Italy may be, it would be extremely difficult to surpass France and dominate all of Europe in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Italy is also aware of this situation. Therefore, it does not hesitate to relax its extremely conservative nationalism and strives to get closer to the Soviet Union in diplomacy. Italy's purpose is to gain the support of Eastern Europe so that it can maneuver freely in Southern Europe, compete in the Mediterranean, and restrain France. However, in mid-January, Mussolini loudly advocated the danger of a war between Japan and the Soviet Union, stating that it would not only directly affect the United States and Central America, but also have an indirect impact on Britain, Italy, and the Netherlands. In addition to praising Japan's developed industry, he also said that the Japanese people are full of militaristic spirit, and their military force is also quite strong. He also said that Japan's economic power has spread all over the world. Although the so-called "Yellow Peril" is not as fierce as it once was, Italy has deeply felt the threat. Therefore, he advocated that white countries should urgently seek political cooperation. The Italian Prime Minister is the highest responsible person in the country, and in spirit, he is quite close to Japan's militaristic fascism. Moreover, between Italy and Japan, as the Japanese diplomatic authorities said, there are actually no conflicts, and diplomatic relations are very stable. So why did the Italian Prime Minister make this anti-Japanese statement, advocating cooperation among white countries, in order to provoke Japan's displeasure? According to Japanese sources, after the Italian Prime Minister published the above-mentioned paper, Italian newspapers also developed the same arguments as Mussolini. Similar views were also revealed in the Italian parliament. Therefore, the Japanese ambassador to Italy, Hajime Matsushima, specifically questioned the Italian Prime Minister. It can be said that a formal war of words has been brewing between Italy and Japan. Regardless of the outcome of this war of words, both countries tend towards Fascism, one considering itself the leader of Europe, the other boasting of dominating Asia. The seriousness of their confrontation, East and West, can already be glimpsed. And the report that Stalin gave at the congress, which was published by TASS yesterday, vigorously exaggerated the success of his plans and also strongly warned Japan. The wording was as serious as Mussolini's. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also felt displeasure about this and decided to issue a statement to engage in a verbal battle with Stalin. Italy and the Soviet Union are countries with completely different ideologies, but they have unexpectedly reached a tacit understanding, launching the same attacks on Japan one after another. It is even more obvious that there is mutual support between Italy and the Soviet Union, expressing the same sympathy for the Far East issue.</p>
<p>The Far East issue is on the verge of danger. Not only Italy and the Soviet Union know this, but also Britain, the United States, and other countries. However, all the countries involved are well aware that the outbreak of a crisis is enough to destroy the Far Eastern market. All countries involved will inevitably suffer significant economic losses, and their own foundations may not be able to guarantee that they will not be fundamentally overturned. Therefore, none of them dared to take this unprecedented risk after the World War. However, seeing Japan's ambition erupting, they all unanimously expanded their military power. The army, navy, and air force are all actively developing. The United States is building new warships, and Britain is building a new military port in Singapore. Moreover, the Soviet Union is paying close attention to national defense, and Italy is expanding its military power. All eyes are focused on Japan in the Far East. The coming of a world war is getting closer and closer. The confrontational situation of various countries cannot be reconciled, and the relationship between Italy's alliance with the Soviet Union to restrain France is a small matter.</p>

President Dai Chuanxian once asked the Panchen Lama to preside over a sutra chanting ceremony to deliver the souls of the dead. Dai visited the Panchen Lama at noon on the 30th with Austrian monk Zhao Kong and other Western monks who were ordained at Qixia Temple. They had a very投機 conversation. As for the position of National Government Committee member, the Panchen Lama will take office at the National Government next Monday. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>

Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, and Jiao Yitang also went to the Panchen Lama's residence on the morning of the 30th to visit the Panchen Lama. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>Have Changed to Take Offensive Plans</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi Said So in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota Believes Russia's Words and Actions Are Gradually Easing</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives opened at 10:35 a.m. today. Long Erdao, President of the Seiyukai, questioned the international situation after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Foreign Minister Hirota explained Japan's relations with China, Russia, and the United States, saying that</p>
<p>Regarding the Russian issue, we plan to gradually resolve important issues between the two countries. We are currently striving to mediate the China Eastern Railway issue. Although relations with China cannot be resolved immediately, the government hopes that they will improve. As for diplomatic work with the United States, if there is a way to reassure the people of both Japan and the United States, it will be implemented immediately. Both Japan and the United States have no intention of creating incidents. Although the method and timing of the treaty between the two countries are not convenient to announce, the government is conducting this diplomatic work as a matter of fact. Long Erdao asked</p>
<p>Japan's relations with Russia have undergone major changes. Does the government have any intention of preventing the deterioration of people's hearts? Foreign Minister Hirota replied</p>
<p>The reason for the change in Japanese-Russian relations lies in the border defense issue. Japan intends to agree with the countries concerned on a treaty restricting border defense. Recently, Soviet Russia's words and actions have gradually eased. First resolve the important outstanding cases, and then we can obtain the stability of the people's hearts of the two countries. Nagaoka asked</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's movement of troops and transportation of military equipment seem to exceed the limits of border defense. Is this a fact? Minister of the Army Hayashi replied</p>
<p>The border defense between Japan and Russia is of course aimed at defensive posture, but it is not without consideration of taking the offensive. Long Erdao then mentioned Sino-Japanese relations, saying</p>
<p>Today is the best time to start Sino-Japanese negotiations. Does the government have the intention to actively carry out Sino-Japanese diplomatic work? Foreign Minister Hirota replied</p>
<p>It is necessary for China and Japan to establish friendly relations, but today is not the time to actively carry out it. We must wait for China's self-awareness, but this is not to say that we are bystanders. Long Erdao asked</p>
<p>Is there a continuing trend in the current world trade war? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>The distorted state of world trade will not stop for the time being. Long Erdao asked</p>
<p>What about British-Japanese economic relations? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>The political and diplomatic relations between the two countries are now quite optimistic, so resolving the international issues between the two countries in terms of commerce is the most necessary thing to maintain the friendly relations between the two countries. When it came to noon, the chairman announced a recess. In the afternoon, they concentrated on the General Budget Committee and reopened at 1:30 p.m. Long Erdao continued to question diplomatic issues, and advocated establishing British-Japanese diplomacy, improving the nature of diplomats in the era of economic diplomacy, and revising the establishment of diplomatic institutions. Foreign Minister Hirota agreed with him. In order to break through the diplomatic difficulties, Long Erdao declared that it is necessary to unify the national opinion and question the Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Hirota replied</p>
<p>I also strongly support national diplomacy. Since taking office, I have explained the concept of the Japanese people to foreign countries, placing its emphasis on this. I am currently working hard to carry it out, because the keynote of the diplomatic policy is nothing more than this. Long Erdao asked</p>
<p>Regarding the major situations of diplomacy, national defense, finance, and economy, what is the Prime Minister's view on handling them well with the cooperation of the entire country and the cabinet? Prime Minister Saito replied</p>
<p>I fully express my agreement. Then, Tanaka Kou of the Minseito Party raised a question</p>
<p>Can the old market be exercised with the principle of imperial coordination? Foreign Minister Hirota replied</p>
<p>I think it should be carried out on the basis of reciprocal relations. Tanaka asked</p>
<p>Do you intend to impose retaliatory tariffs on countries that impose improper tariffs? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>I intend to seek ad hoc disposition, and this matter is still under study. Tanaka said that concluding the Japanese-Indian trade treaty is unfavorable, and attacked the Foreign Minister, saying</p>
<p>Does the Foreign Minister think that the Japanese-Indian trade treaty is a success? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>I don't think it is satisfactory. Minister of Commerce Nakajima also replied</p>
<p>Of course, it cannot be said to be a success. Tanaka also asked</p>
<p>What is our countermeasure to the establishment of tariff barriers by various countries? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>This is a major issue, and the government is not in a position to publish the considerations hastily. Tanaka also asked the Director of the Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kurosuke, about the exchange rate issue of the Japanese-Indian agreement, asking</p>
<p>Is there any intention to abrogate the new cotton cloth agreement? In the government, in the event of an emergency, is there a final determination to reform it? The Foreign Minister replied</p>
<p>The government's future policy is not convenient to state clearly, but I feel that there is a need to promote its establishment as much as possible. Tanaka asked again</p>
<p>What I am asking is not this, but asking about the government's determination. Please explain it clearly. The Prime Minister stood up and replied</p>
<p>The government is prepared to work hard to thoroughly implement the measures. After Tanaka raised various questions to the Minister of Agriculture, Representative Kazutami from the Seiyukai raised questions focusing on rural issues and social policies, and the meeting adjourned near six o'clock.

<p>(Paris) The famous predictor Professor Remon declared today that the United States and Japan will go to war in 1946, but in 1935, Japan and Russia will inevitably have a war. He also said that when Japan, the United States, and Russia dispute in the future, the European countries will remain neutral. He also predicted that a ship will sink in the Atlantic Ocean this year, and there will be a train accident in Wahiawa, Hawaii. There will be three train accidents in France, one in Romania, and a submarine accident in Britain this year. There will be earthquakes in the United States, Italy, Cuba, Japan, China, Java, and Sumatra this year.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the foreign situation, Ambassador Yan Huiqing has passed through Hong Kong and is heading north, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai and transfer to Nanjing around the 3rd of next month. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Daily Telegraph today published in large font a piece from its Singapore correspondent with the opinion of Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese Minister to Russia. Dr. Yan believes that the next world war will take place in the Pacific, and the competition between Britain and Japan for the Far East market will be the cause of the next war. Russia is not yet prepared for war. Even if Japan provokes it, the Soviet Union will not rush to war due to the situation. He fears that any dispute in the Pacific will inevitably involve China. He believes that Japan's ambition is now focused on the oil-rich region of eastern Siberia. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an article by Crocker, commenting on the issue of the Japanese-Russian War, stating that the United States Army and Navy authorities deeply believe that the outbreak of the Japanese-Russian War is only a matter of time. At present, the construction of double tracks on the Siberian Railway has not yet been completed. Once the war starts, the Soviet Union can only transport 300 troops to eastern Siberia every day, which is beneficial for waiting. If Japan can delay the start of the war for a year or more, the Soviet Union's railway construction project will definitely progress, and Russia will also be able to send a considerable number of reinforcements to Siberia. The new Japanese Minister of the Army, General Hayashi, is well aware of this, but would rather wait, because once the war breaks out, Russian planes can fly out of Vladivostok and bomb the industrial centers of Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama. The Soviet Air Force has a formidable reputation, and Japan has no ability to resist it. In addition, according to news received from Washington, the situation occupied by the Japanese in "Manchukuo" does not seem as solid as it appears on the surface. Even in the "future emperor" Puyi, there are also some difficulties. This is another reason for Japan's caution, and so on. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Hishikari, Commander of the Kwantung Army, arrived in Dalian at 7:20 p.m. on the 29th with staff officer Tatsumi, adjutant Reigang, secretary Tsurumi, secretary Shiohara, and Captain Kishi of the Military Police to inspect the affairs of the Kwantung Government. They immediately took a car to the official residence in Lushun. Commander Hishikari made the following remarks to visitors: The Soviet Russian military preparations on the Russian-Manchurian border seem to have completed the outer encirclement of Manchuria. There are considerable actions in Vladivostok, all the way to Daury and the Red Army base. It is impossible to know whether these military preparations are for defense or attack, because they are the intentions of the Red Army. Therefore, we should be most cautious about occasional incidents in the future. From this, we can know that Soviet Russia misunderstands Japan's true intentions. If the Japanese can travel to Moscow one after another to carry out the so-called national diplomacy, it seems to be very meaningful to ease the atmosphere. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>

Therefore, the issue became more serious. "Manchukuo" has telegraphed Li Shaogeng, Superintendent of the East Railway, to return to Changchun. After Li arrived in Changchun at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, a top-level meeting was held, probably to avoid major events, so it was planned to resolve the issue through local negotiations. Li Shaogeng was temporarily ordered to rest, and Ding Jianxiu, Director of Transportation, was transferred to the position of Chairman of the East Railway. (Dentsu Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Naval Affairs Committee Passes Vinson Amendment</p>
<p>Authorizing the President to Expand Air Force Strength</p>
<p>Submitted to the House of Representatives for Discussion Yesterday</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee unanimously passed Mr. Vinson's proposal to purchase 1,184 naval aircraft, along with amendments. Thus, the bill has good prospects for passage in Congress. The House will discuss the bill tomorrow. Currently, both the House and Senate have no objections to the proposal. The amendment appropriates 90 million dollars and authorizes the President to add aircraft to complete the naval plan. According to Vice Admiral Standley, the Washington Conference stipulated that the navy could have 2,184 aircraft. The United States currently has only 1,000, so 1,184 more are needed. 650 of these are already under construction, and the remaining 534 will be rushed into production as soon as the proposal and amendments are passed. If Mr. Vinson's proposal and amendments are passed, the strength of the US Navy and Air Force can be expanded to the stipulated number. The naval budget bill has already passed for the addition of one 8-inch gunboat and three 6-inch gun cruisers, and the expansion of the navy to 81,500 personnel and the Marine Corps to 16,000. Repairs will be made to old warships, and 102 warships must be added within five years according to Mr. Vinson's proposal. Furthermore, the US Navy Department announced this week a "Naval Five-Year Plan," and the previous proposal to add 1,184 aircraft may be based on this. (29th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Britain Sends Note to Seven Governments</p>
<h3 id="e35">Endorsing German Military Equality <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Suggesting a Compromise Solution</p>
<p>Reconciling Franco-German Differences</p>
<p>Mussolini's Sympathy Undoubted</p>
<p>Fate Hinges on US Attitude</p>
<p>(London) The contents of the British memorandum on disarmament have been revealed today. It is reported that Britain has formally informed the countries concerned of its recognition of Germany's right to equality in armaments. The countries that received the memorandum include Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, and Poland. Its content includes Britain's fundamental position on important armament issues, with the main points as follows: (1) Proposing the absolute elimination or reduction of offensive weapons. (2) Equality of armaments, meaning Britain promotes the abolition of the probationary period under the management of various countries and recognizes that Germany should immediately obtain equality in national defense armaments. The fate of the memorandum will depend entirely on the attitude of the United States, as its content proposed referring to the Kellogg Pact's provisions for resolving international disputes. Germany's disarmament and probationary period have long been France's demand for security. If the United States agrees with Britain's proposal, all parties are confident that France will concede. Since Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, France has already made significant concessions, but the extent to which it will concede is still difficult to predict. German Chancellor Hitler demands Germany's rearmament, arguing that the weakness of Germany's current armaments is a major obstacle to the future of European peace, as neighboring countries will take the opportunity to invade. It is widely believed that this British memorandum will be strongly supported by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, as he previously stated that allowing Germany's military equality is an obligation of international morality. (30th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed reporters, Britain's mediation plan will firmly reject the claim for a probationary period and propose that Germany be allowed to possess defensive weapons based on the principle of rights, and propose that the number of such weapons should be determined in later negotiations.

<p>Simultaneously Addressing Disarmament, Equality, and Security</p>
<p>Maintaining the Supervisory System, the Probationary Period Renamed Transition</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources in London, the method stated in the British memorandum is to seek a compromise between Germany's armament demands and France's security demands according to the main principles. The main principles are three: disarmament, armament, equality, and security. As for the controversial "disarmament probationary period," it is renamed "transition period." During this period, countries should reduce offensive weapons, but Germany should obtain some samples of such weapons. Regarding the issue of troop numbers, Germany demands 300,000, while the MacDonald plan stipulates 200,000. This memorandum seeks a compromise number between the two. Regarding the issue of security, the supervisory system is still maintained, but it must be implemented universally in all countries so that Germany will no longer have grievances. The memorandum also argues that if Germany violates its promises, the countries of the disarmament convention should consult each other and may suspend their own obligations under the convention.

<p>(London) Official circles are unwilling to criticize the content of the British disarmament memorandum, but reliable sources say that Britain is now acting as a mediator again. Although Franco-German negotiations have broken down, the desire of both countries to reach a solution is more urgent than before. France can certainly appeal to the League of Nations, but the result of this move will ultimately be the failure of the main body of the disarmament conference. Direct Franco-German negotiations do not seem to be the right time now. In order to promote mediation, the British memorandum will definitely put forward new disarmament methods and be accepted by people. Britain's previous proposals have been well received by the countries concerned, and the new proposals are even more advanced than the previous ones. (30th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>Simon Explains:</p>
<p>Clarifying the Urgent Need for Disarmament</p>
<p>No Criticism of the Pseudo-Reform System</p>
<p>(London) The British House of Commons reconvened today after the Christmas holiday. Labour Party leader Lansbury was absent due to illness, so the opposition party is temporarily led by Attlee. Foreign Secretary Simon recounted his conversations with Mussolini, Schuschnigg, and Benckendorff, saying that this discussion greatly helped clarify the issue of disarmament and establish points of agreement. The British government also obtained more detailed information from diplomatic channels about Germany's statements after Hitler's withdrawal from the disarmament conference. As a result, the British government decided that it was now time to announce its attitude on this important issue. Britain has sent a memorandum to the countries most recently involved in the discussion, and the original text will be published later. The British government believes that any issue concerning the improvement of the League of Nations is secondary to the more urgent issue of disarmament. France and Italy share this view. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has stated that the purpose of his proposal to improve the League of Nations is to consolidate the League of Nations' institutions and make them more effective. Britain does not want to take any action on this matter until the disarmament negotiations have yielded results. Simon also briefly mentioned the Far East incident and the rebellion in Fujian Province, saying that the Chinese government's friendly acceptance of the British note requesting protection of British lives and property in Fujian Province was quite gratifying. Simon then mentioned the news of Puyi's enthronement, but did not criticize it. Many members of the House of Commons inquired about the progress of the British-Japanese cotton industry discussions. Overseas Trade Minister Colville answered them one by one, saying that the discussion must also include the rayon industry, which is very clear and should not give rise to any objections. He hopes that the discussion can be successful quickly, and the government does not impose any time limit on the negotiations. (29th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Since the Establishment of the British Government</p>
<h3 id="e40">Facing the Most Critical Period <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to the opinion of the general public in London, after the Parliament reconvenes today, the British government will enter the most critical period since its establishment. The Socialist Party has announced that a general election will be held this year, but the government seems to have no reason to step down before 1936. However, every government must undergo a major test in its third year. Now, both friends and enemies of the government are demanding that the government adopt a bolder attitude on many issues. Many people, especially on the disarmament issue, believe that only if Britain takes a firm stance can the debate on peace and war be decided. At the same time, opponents of the government are clamoring that Britain has reduced its armaments to the point where they cannot be reduced any further, so how can it expect foreign countries to pay attention? As for the government's attitude towards disarmament, it is already well-prepared, and its nature can only be expressed after foreign governments have studied its stated aspirations. It is expected that the government, in addition to the questions it must answer in the House of Commons today, will also be forced to deal with issues such as reforming the League of Nations, resisting Japanese trade competition, and assisting the British shipping industry. The Socialist Party is also prepared to fight unremittingly for the unemployment insurance bill. According to the phenomena, the whole country is already tired of the old party struggles, and the true meaning of the national unity government is also nearly vague. Therefore, there is a demand to absorb the steady elements of the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labour Party, who are not entirely satisfied with the current government. However, in view of the Socialist Party's or the Fascist dictatorship's intimidation, they want to embark on a dangerous path again. (29th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Concentrating Talents, a New French Cabinet is Formed</p>

<p>Swiftly and Firmly as Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Thoroughly Reforming Finances as its Duty</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Daladier, the resigning Minister of the Army, was ordered by President Lebrun to form a new cabinet, and has now succeeded. Its list is as follows: Prime Minister Daladier, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs; Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Marie (Secretary-General of the Council of State in the Sarraut Cabinet); Minister of Justice, Berthon (Minister of Justice in Daladier's first cabinet); Minister of the Interior, Frot (Minister of Labour in the Chautemps Cabinet); Undersecretary of the Interior, Heraud (Member of Parliament); Minister of Finance and Budget, Pietri (Minister of Colonies in the Sarraut Cabinet); Minister of the Army, Fabry (Member of Parliament); Minister of Agriculture, Queuille (unchanged); Minister of Aviation, Cot (unchanged); Minister of Colonies, Jeanneney (Senator, former Ambassador to Italy); Minister of Commerce, Mistler (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in the Chautemps Cabinet); Minister of the Navy, Champetier de Ribes (Member of Parliament); Secretary-General of the Council of State, Marnot de Sainte Marie (Member of Parliament). (30th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new Prime Minister Daladier declared that the new cabinet's guiding principles are swiftness and firmness. The first cabinet meeting has already been held this afternoon. Daladier also issued a declaration stating that the budget bill must be voted on before the end of March, and the national expenditure system must be thoroughly reformed. He also said that the restoration of confidence and the settlement of finances are necessary conditions for the success of foreign policy. Judging from this, the new cabinet does have an air of swiftness and firmness. Daladier has brought together the left, the center, and the right, and has excluded all extremists in the parliament, which is unprecedented. The characteristics of the new cabinet are: Béranger, Chairman of the Senate Civil and Criminal Legislation Committee, as Minister of Justice, who will handle the Stavisky suicide investigation thoroughly; Fabry as Minister of the Army, who is a loyal member of the right wing and the editor-in-chief of L'Action Française; Pietri as Minister of Finance, who is a recognized expert and known for his loyalty; and the Ministry of Colonies is now renamed the Ministry of Overseas Territories, and the minister is Senator Jeanneney, who is also highly talented. Daladier's self-appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs can make the cabinet's work particularly smooth, as he has long held this position and has a strong view on the necessity of direct Franco-German understanding.

At the second meeting, it was considered that the current situation required exceptional measures. Daladier proposed cooperation to the party, but it could not fully agree with this measure. The party found it inconvenient to join the new cabinet. This decision was subsequently passed by a vote of thirteen to nine. (30th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>Today, about 8,000 civil servants here organized a large team to parade and demonstrate, with the purpose of attacking the political corruption discovered in the Stavisky affair and opposing the salary reduction plan, resulting in the suspension of all trams in the city, the destruction of tracks, and many vehicles being pushed off the tracks. The public benches, newspaper stands, and advertising pillars along the road were also destroyed. Small trees were even uprooted to be used as wooden sticks, and the tables and chairs in many cafes were smashed. The police intervened several times before order was restored.

<p>All of Germany Enthusiastically Celebrates</p>
<h3 id="e45">First Anniversary of Hitler's Rule <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>New Parliament Opens on the Same Day</p>
<p>Prime Minister Will Deliver a Speech</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the first anniversary of the Nazi Party's Chancellor Hitler's rule in Germany. The celebration is very enthusiastic, but the use of torches and the prohibition of noise are prohibited. Therefore, the audience was unusually quiet when Hitler spoke in parliament. From early morning, national flags flew all over the city. Wilhelmstrasse, where Hitler lived, was almost entirely surrounded by the public, all eager to see the demeanor of this great man. The newspapers were also full of congratulatory messages, congratulating Chancellor Hitler on his success over the past year, and expressing their deep faith in Hitler's loyalty to the country and hoping that Hitler would continue to fight for the country and overcome all difficulties.

<p>(Berlin) Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the Nazi Party's Chancellor Hitler taking power in Germany. There will be extremely simple celebrations throughout Germany. The reason is that although the great construction work of the country is already in rapid progress, it is still far from completion. Therefore, the joy of the people should also be delayed. However, those among the people who wish to express themselves because of the revolution should automatically donate goods to benefit their unemployed compatriots.</p>

Hindenburg concluded by saying that he has complete confidence in Hitler and that the great achievements that he has bravely begun will not be completed quickly. Hindenburg also prayed that the unity that has now been established in the country can exist forever. (29th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Bulgaria Can Hardly Accept the Border Security Issue</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente Will Continue Consultations</p>
<h3 id="e52">Capital of Yugoslavia <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The King of Bulgaria, accompanied by the Prime Minister, was in the capital to discuss the issue of a non-aggression treaty between the Balkan countries with the Romanian authorities. The general public originally thought that as a result of the talks, this treaty would not be difficult to establish quickly. Looking at the current situation, I am afraid that this hope cannot be realized. Responsible people here also said that it is too early to say that the Balkan Treaty can be signed on the second of next month. The draft treaty originally drafted by Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Greek Foreign Minister Maximos has been amended after the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente countries in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and the talks between Bulgaria and Romania. The parties concerned cannot agree on everything, and there are still areas for consultation. Therefore, the Foreign Ministers of Greece, Romania, and Turkey are scheduled to arrive here on the second of next month to renegotiate with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić. Bulgaria originally did not object in principle to the Balkan Non-Aggression Treaty. However, the draft treaty stipulates that the contracting states shall mutually guarantee territorial security and border security, which is tantamount to adding another layer of guarantee to the Peace Treaty, which Bulgaria is dissatisfied with. This is precisely why Bulgaria does not want to participate in the new Balkan Convention. When the Foreign Ministers of Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia meet at the beginning of next month, they will first discuss this complex border security issue, and Yugoslavia in particular wants to find a way to make Bulgaria recognize it.

<p>Britain and the United States Have Not Reached an Understanding</p>
<h3 id="e53">Currency War is Almost Inevitable <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Informal Negotiations are Underway</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said today that he will soon begin currency talks with Britain. According to responsible sources, the Treasury Department has not reached an understanding with London on the relationship between the pound and the dollar. Since the Treasury Department intends to use its newly established 200 million dollar equalization fund, a fierce currency war may be unavoidable. Morgenthau openly admitted that he did not know whether a currency war was about to break out, but others believed that it was inevitable. The House of Representatives unanimously agreed to the Senate's amendment to the currency bill. Tonight, Congress may send this bill to President Roosevelt, who will immediately issue a proclamation ordering that the value of the dollar be reduced by 40 percent. (29th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, after accepting the Senate's amendment to the currency bill in the House of Representatives today, replied to questions from members of Congress, saying that we are not currently having any discussions with Britain, but if someone asks about this again next week, he will not be willing to answer. Morgenthau also said that he has prepared several orders for managing gold, and the government will issue them after the President approves the currency bill. When asked about a currency war, Morgenthau smiled and replied that both sides must pay a heavy price for such a war. He also said that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will continue to operate the equalization fund as an agency of the Treasury Department. The Wall Street Journal said that formal negotiations to maintain the status quo are currently underway, and the pound will be temporarily stabilized at a price of four dollars and seventy-five cents for a six-cornered dollar.

Since the various public bureaus in Chahar Province have successively fallen, tax revenue has been short. The monthly income, in addition to paying expenses at 80% of the budget, has little left over. Austerity should be implemented to save money. It is difficult to handle the section that the bureau and its subordinate branches now administer expenses according to the budget amount. However, in order to rectify the bureau affairs and maintain the lives of the soldiers, redundant personnel should be laid off immediately, and office expenses should be issued appropriately. Within the scope of the current 80% expense number, from January 23, all soldiers' salaries will be paid in full, and no further reductions will be allowed, in order to show compassion."

<p>(Nanjing) The International Meteorological Society previously decided that August 1, 1932 to August 31, 1933 would be the International Second Polar Year.

With the assistance of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, the Central Meteorological Research Institute of our country also purchased instruments and established weather stations on the Jade Emperor Peak of Mount Tai in Shandong and the Thousand Buddha Peak of Mount Emei in Sichuan. The following results were obtained from thirteen months of observation during the Polar Year: (1) The abundance of rainfall on the summit of Mount Emei. During the Polar Year, a total of 9226 millimeters of rainfall was recorded, which is equivalent to ten years' worth of rainfall in the Beijing-Shanghai area. (2) The annual air pressure on Mount Emei is low in winter and high in summer. On the plains, the air pressure in various parts of our country is high in winter and low in summer, which creates a monsoon climate. However, the air pressure variation on Mount Emei is high in summer and low in winter. (3) The temperature on Mount Emei in winter is higher than that on Mount Tai. Mount Emei is about 1,800 meters higher than Mount Tai, but the temperature in winter is actually higher than that on Mount Tai. (4) There are no monsoons on Mount Emei throughout the year.

<h3 id="e92">Deploys Guangdong Border Defense <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Large Army Opens to the Fujian-Guangdong Border</p>
<p>Airfields Massively Expanded</p>
<p>Coastal Defenses Also Established in Shantou</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: After the defeat of the 19th Route Army in Fujian, Chen Jitang immediately transferred a large army to the Fujian-Guangdong border. Currently, Deng Longguang's and Li Genliang's divisions and Chen Zhang's brigade are defending the three counties of Dapu, Yongding, and Pinghe. Chen also appointed Fan Zongchi, former regimental commander of the 19th Route Army, to enter Fujian with Deng Longguang's division. Chen Weiyuan, former brigade commander of the 19th Route Army, was also appointed Commander of the Southern Fujian Garrison. Chen left Shantou on the 25th and entered Zhao'an via Raoping. Chen, originally from Fujian, has considerable connections with Zhang Zhen's old troops. His purpose in entering Fujian is to recruit the local armies of various counties in southern Fujian, and at the same time, to enlist stray troops from the 19th Route Army to return. After entering Fujian, Chen will set up an office between Pinghe, Yunxiao, and Zhangpu. The division commanders of the stationed troops on the Fujian-Guangdong border have returned to the province in recent days at the invitation of Chen Jitang to discuss key border defense issues of Fujian and Jiangxi. Huang Renhuan, Zhang Ruigui, and Huang Yanzhen are all in Guangzhou. Liu Shunan's regiment, the 14th Regiment of Li Zhenliang's division, passed through Xingning and entered Fenglang in Dapu on the 23rd. Ma Yi, of the 13th Regiment, opened to Sanheba from Wuhua on the 26th. Li Zhenliang and the division headquarters' special service battalion moved entirely to Dapu on the 27th. Luo Xiuli's 15th Regiment was also transported from Shanwei to Shantou in succession aboard the HaiRui and HaiZhou warships, and then transferred to Raoping Shangrao to guard Tiger Pass. It is said that Li's division is going to Yongding and Pinghe, so in recent days, the counties in the upper reaches of the Han River have been extremely busy hiring laborers. Each county has been ordered to recruit 200 people, and each police district has been ordered to search for recruits from the public. Deng Longguang's division stationed in Huizhou also moved out on the 23rd. Pan Biao, the first regimental commander, Tang Fu, the second regimental commander, Zhao Lan, the third regimental commander, Lu Haodong, the fourth regimental commander, and Wang Dequan, the training regimental commander, all started from Heyuan, Laolong, Zijin, Wuhua, and Xingning counties and advanced. They concentrated in Meixian on the 27th and advanced to Guanshi in Jiaoling Wuping Shanghang. The various units of Miao Peinan's division, the first regiment, Chen Cequn, and the third regiment, Chen Qijie, and the training regiment of the Second Army, Zhang Wei's troops, also filled the defense along the Dong River. It is also said that Chen Zhang's brigade will be transferred from the North River to the upper reaches of the East River, Heping Longchuan, and even to the Fujian border. At present, the defensive works in the various counties on the Guangdong border have been completely completed, and road traffic is also very convenient. Xingning Jiaoling Raoping on the route from Guangzhou to the Fujian-Jiangxi border can all be reached in one day. It only takes six hours to travel from Chaoshan Jieyang to Xingning, and there are also a large number of cars for transportation. Chen Jitang previously purchased 50 large cars from Hong Kong, and 20 of them have arrived on the eastern route and are being used for military purposes. The Meixian airfield has been expanded to twice its size at Gutangping since the plane accident, forming a human-shaped airfield that can accommodate the take-off and landing of 30 aircraft. Hangars, oil depots, anti-aircraft guns, listening devices, and searchlights are all available. The layout is even better than that of the Shantou airfield, with a model of an air force base. There are also airfields in Jiaoling and Xingning, but they are not as grand as the one in Meixian. Chen Jitang also ordered the counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou to form 100 companies of people's reserve teams, each team with 30 people. All guns and artillery are supplied by the headquarters and are responsible for bandit defense. The Fengshun County police force has been allocated 20 mortars, as well as a number of machine guns and rifles, from the headquarters. In addition, Guangdong Province has recently been actively deploying for coastal defense. Zhang Zhiying, commander of the Shantou and Shanwei coastal naval fortress, is responsible for the equipment. Zhang has ordered four of the latest type of torpedoes from the Vickers shipyard in England, each costing 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. The first and second torpedoes have already been delivered, and Zhang has appointed Zou Wenguang as the captain of the first ship and Liang Kangnian as the captain of the second ship. The third and fourth ships will also be delivered during the day and will be stationed in Shantou and Qiongzhou. Secondly, six new-style 1,000-ton miniature gunboats have been ordered from England, which can sail on both rivers and seas. In addition, 20,000 steel helmets, searchlights, iron arrow silk, and various other large quantities of military supplies have been purchased in Hong Kong. He is very excited about the deployment of the Fujian-Jiangxi border defense.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Question of Inner Mongolia's Request for Autonomy (Continued) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Mongolians Still Hold Objections to Central Government Regulations</p>
<p>D. The Relationship Between Leagues and Provinces: The League Headquarters is built above the Banner, and the Province is built above the County, so the League Headquarters and the Province are also a dual organization in the same place, only differing in the size of their area. For example, the Xilingol League governs ten Banners, the Chahar League governs twelve Banners, the Ulanqab League governs six Banners, the Ikh Juu League governs seven Banners, and Tumet is a special Banner. The Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces govern the ten counties north of the Great Wall that were transferred from Hebei, and the six counties established in the four Banners and four groups of the left wing of the Chahar League, respectively. The Suiyuan Province governs the eighteen counties established in the four Banners of the right wing of the Ulanqab League, the Ikh Juu League, the Tumet Banner, and the Chahar League. The League Headquarters and the Provinces are all directly under the central government. The position of the League Headquarters has not changed due to the establishment of Provinces. Therefore, the five counties of Taolin and Jining, etc., established in the four Banners of the right wing of the Chahar League, are under the jurisdiction of Suiyuan Province, but the four Banners still belong to the Chahar League. This proves that the Provinces and Counties and the League Headquarters and Banners each form a system. In the event of matters involving mutual affairs, they shall be handled through consultation. This is the fact. The organization law of the League Headquarters and Banners also has clear provisions. However, conflicts often arise when the Provinces and Counties encroach on the League Banners. E. The Reclamation and Preservation of Land: Mongolian land was originally the natural pasture of the Mongolian people. Since the free migration of people from the interior and the forced reclamation of land by the Mongolian border Provinces and Counties, Mongolians who cannot be changed into farmers have been greatly affected in their livelihoods. After the reclamation, the provincial and county governments did not allocate the land price that the Mongolian Banner should have received and the annual land rent that should have been divided according to the original regulations, which made the administrative expenses of the League Banner also feel difficult. If this continues, the League Banner and the Mongolian people will likely perish together. Therefore, the Mongol officials and people are all in fear when they hear the sound of reclamation. At present, the advocacy of reserving uncultivated Mongolian land as pasture for the Mongolian people, improving animal husbandry, starting ancillary industries, and developing the local economy, and that even cultivation must be according to the convenience of the Mongolian people, has become a general appeal of Mongolia. As for the issue of land owner and tenant rights of Mongolian and Han people in the cultivated areas, disputes and lawsuits are constantly occurring. As a result, most Mongolians fail, and national feelings are also affected. Therefore, stopping the reclamation of Mongolian pastureland and reorganizing the cultivated land have become urgent issues on the Mongolian border today. F. The Collection and Division of Taxes: The income of uncultivated Mongolian land has always been managed by the Mongolian Banner. The Mongolian Banner also collects taxes on cultivated land. For example, the Ulanqab League and the Ikh Juu League collect Mongolian rent and water grass fees from the reclaimers within their borders, and coal rent and taxes from the coal mines. The Banners of the Chahar League collect the four-percent private rent from the reclaimers within their borders. All these are rents and taxes collected by the Mongolian Banner in its capacity as a landlord. All the administrative expenses of the League Banner are also maintained by this. In addition, the collection bureaus set up by the Provinces and Counties in the Mongolian Banner also allocate a certain amount to the Mongolian Banner. For example, the Suiyuan Province allocates thousands of yuan to the Darhan Banner every year from the Baolingu Temple Tax Bureau. This kind of collection or division is especially common in eastern Mongolia. However, the Provinces and Counties often infringe on and withhold this tax revenue of the Mongolian Banner. For example, after the Ziyou County collected the four-percent private rent that the Banners of the Chahar League should have received, it has not allocated a single penny for many years. The resentment of the Mongolian people arises from this. Therefore, protecting the inherent rent and taxes of the Mongolian Banner and properly setting the tax-sharing method with the Provinces are also major issues on the Mongolian border today. (II) The Process and Key Points of the Autonomy Method Agreed Upon at Baolingu Temple: In the autumn of last year, the heads and representatives of the Mongolian Leagues and Banners gathered at Baolingu Temple to request autonomy. There were two purposes: (1) To unite the Leagues and Banners and special Banners, which have always governed themselves separately, in order to jointly resist foreign aggression. (2) To eliminate the disputes between the League Banners and the Provincial Counties, so as to avoid the danger of evolving into ethnic struggles in the future. Therefore, the Baolingu Temple Autonomy Conference initially advocated abolishing the Mongolian border provinces and establishing an entire Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government, acting under the central government, to govern all Inner Mongolian Banners and Counties, for Mongolians and Han to cooperate and jointly resist foreign aggression. It also drafted thirty-six articles of the Organizational Law of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government at the conference and sent them to Minister Huang when he arrived at Baolingu Temple, requesting that they be forwarded to the central government. On the Mongolian side in Baolingu Temple, this was called a high degree of autonomy. Minister Huang did not accept it because the abolition of the border provinces involved too much. In order to respect the wishes of the central government officials, the heads and representatives of the various Leagues and Banners in Baolingu Temple, after several days of discussion, proposed eleven other methods, advocating that the entire Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government should still be established, but its powers should be reduced to exclusively governing the Leagues and Banners, while the Mongolian border Provinces would still exist and exclusively govern their respective Counties. However, it would be necessary to clearly divide the powers and revenues between the Provincial Counties and the League Banners, stop the reclamation, and not establish any more Counties. For the existing Provincial Counties, they would cooperate. On the Mongolian side in Baolingu Temple, this was called a medium degree of autonomy. After this method was sent to Minister Huang by the delegates sent by the Presidium of the Autonomy Conference on November 16, Minister Huang sent Li Songfeng and others to discuss with Su Ludai and others sent by the Presidium. As a result, this method was not accepted because the first article still advocated organizing the entire Autonomous Government, which was inconsistent with the principle decided by the central government that Mongolian autonomy should be based on the Province. On the morning of November 17, Minister Huang announced his departure from Mongolia and his return to the south, expressing his finality. For the sake of seeking compromise, the heads and representatives of the various Leagues and Banners, after repeated discussions, and by midnight, changed the first article of the previously sent method into two methods: (A) Establishing the First and Second Autonomous Region Governments to govern the various League Banners, respectively. (B) Establishing the entire Mongolian Autonomous Committee to exclusively govern the various League Banners.</p>
<p>On the Mongolian side in Baolingu Temple, these two were called a low degree of autonomy. After this method was sent to Minister Huang for adoption of one of the two, Minister Huang expressed his acceptance of method A when he met with the Presidium of the Autonomy Conference on the morning of the 18th. As for the ten articles below the second article of the previously sent method, the Presidium also requested that they be completed, and Minister Huang agreed to do his best. In the afternoon, Li Songfeng and others designated by Minister Huang and Su Ludai and others designated by the Presidium studied this method article by article, and no objections were raised. This is what is called the eleven articles of the autonomy method agreed upon at Baolingu Temple. The key points of the second and subsequent articles of the method were the two items of stopping the release of pastureland and dividing the tax revenue. Therefore, in the telegram of thanks to the central government from the Presidium, in addition to stating the method of regional autonomy, there were also the words "Regarding the cases of stopping the release of pastureland and dividing local tax revenue, they are also allowed to be handled as much as possible." The draft of the telegram had been reviewed by Minister Huang, so the Mongolian side believed that Minister Huang had accepted this method.</p>

<p>Five Important Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Henan Province Yellow River flood prevention conference was held this morning at 9:00 AM in the Construction Department. Attendees included Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Construction Department; Chen Ruzhen, Director of the River Affairs Bureau; Zhang Hanying, representative of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission; Chen Hefu, representative of the Huai River Regulation Commission; Su Jinren, representative of the Longhai Railway Bureau; Zhu Xianbin, representative of the Jinpu Railway Bureau; Gu Houxi, representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Government; Fan Jiatu, representative of the Anhui Provincial Government; as well as Xu Baikui, section chief of the Henan Construction Department, and Xie Zhian, technical expert. Zhang Jingyu chaired the meeting, with Dong Mingcheng as the recorder.</p>
<p>Following standard procedures, Chairman Zhang delivered a report, essentially stating that since the major flood in Henan last year, the foundations of the dikes have been severely eroded by the floodwaters. The works along the southern bank are especially dangerous. Chairman Liu of the province specially invited representatives from the Ministry and relevant provinces to jointly discuss how to prevent an unprecedented catastrophe. The discussion points can be divided into three aspects: engineering, transportation, and economics.</p>
<p>Next, the matters for discussion: (1) How should the construction principles for dangerous sections of the Yellow River in Henan Province be defined? Resolved: 1. The top of the dikes at dangerous sections should be raised to at least two meters above the 1933 flood level as the standard. 2. The width of the dike top should be at least 20 meters. 3. For dikes, the slope on the river side should be 1:3 above 5 meters, and 1:5 below (the principle for increasing the height and thickness of the dike body is to use silt). 4. Stone work, except for building groynes and revetments at necessary locations, should primarily focus on repairing old dikes. 5. Sufficient stone materials, earth bulls, and  materials must be prepared at each dangerous section.</p>
<p>(2) How should the plans for dangerous sections be drafted? Resolved: The plans for dangerous sections should be based on the principles in the first resolution, with reference to the post-flood engineering plans of the River Affairs Bureau and the opinions of the Construction Department. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Henan Provincial Construction Department, and the River Affairs Bureau will jointly draft the plans, to be completed within two weeks. The Construction Department will be responsible for convening the meeting and each party will send a special representative.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the transportation of materials needed for dangerous sections of the Yellow River in Henan Province to ensure speed, please discuss. Resolved: 1. The railway should provide free transportation of the required stone materials to the designated stations. 2. Request the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Railways to lend 180 li of narrow-gauge railway track and 300 dump trucks to the province for laying and transporting materials.</p>
<p>(4) How should the quantity and storage locations of stone materials be determined? Resolved: 1. Temporarily store 10,000 cubic meters in Kaifeng. Temporarily store 10,000 cubic meters in Zhongmou. Temporarily store 50,000 cubic meters in Zhengzhou and Rongze.</p>
<p>(5) How should the funding for the dangerous section projects be raised? Resolved: After the plans are drafted, Henan will consult with the customs, various ministries and commissions, and the provincial government to jointly raise the funds.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned around 1:00 PM. (January 27th)</p>

<p>| County Magistrate Chen Tongshou Accused by Citizens |</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: In recent months, the Control Yuan has repeatedly received dozens of accusations from citizens of Lianshui, including Jing, alleging that Chen Tongshou, the county magistrate of Lianshui, illegally extorted thousands of yuan from Tang Zihou, the wealthiest household in Lianshui, forged deeds, seized a property belonging to Feng Baoxuan, and through Zhu Zongwen, extorted thousands of yuan from Pan Zuoqing and Pan Kaiqing. Furthermore, through Wang Boquan, he extorted 500 yuan from Jing Fuxiang, purchased six pieces of farmland and built two buildings during his tenure, opened a salt shop with Wang Boquan and others, and his wife, Gu, engaged in usury. The Control Yuan has dispatched a secretary to Lianshui to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="e96">County Government Convenes River Dredging Conference <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The city river in Songjiang has been in disrepair for many years, gradually silting up. The river water is murky, and at low tide, it is almost like a ditch, severely affecting drinking water and sanitation. From the beginning of his tenure, County Magistrate Jin considered river dredging to be an essential task, but due to the large scale of the project and high costs, it had not been undertaken. Now, with the start of the agricultural slack season, it is a good opportunity for river dredging. Therefore, County Magistrate Jin convened a meeting of local public organization leaders at the county government at 1:00 PM on the 30th to discuss river dredging.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Jin chaired the meeting, reported on the purpose of the meeting, and reported on the river dredging plan, budget, and survey situation in detail. More than 30 people attended, including Cai Zhongyu. The original plan was to dredge the city trunk river and estimated the cost at 48,000 yuan. Subsequently, attendees suggested that since a large-scale river dredging was underway, the tributary rivers connected to the trunk river, such as Bailongtan and Songjiaqiao, should also be dredged at the same time, otherwise the trunk river would easily silt up again even if it was dredged. The meeting resolved to reassess the total cost, which was estimated to be approximately 70,000 yuan, with half of the funds to be raised through donations. The county government would allocate 3,000 yuan from the construction fund, borrow 10,000 yuan from the seawall fund, and borrow 15,000 yuan from the 1934 construction fund. A remaining 7,000 yuan would be raised from the areas along the tributary roads.</p>
<p>With the funding secured, the meeting moved on to organizational matters. Nine people, including Cai Zhongyu and Wang Zhewu, were elected as standing committee members. Li Yangxian was appointed to the General Affairs Section, Li Jingxian to the Economic Section, Shen Lianbi to the Audit Section, and Xu Mojia to the Engineering Section, each taking on specific responsibilities. The meeting concluded after discussions and preparations. The county government will report the proceedings of today's meeting to the Provincial Construction Department for record-keeping and will immediately begin the work.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Bankruptcy Dispute of Renchangyu Cloth Shop in Suzhou <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Renchangyu Cloth Shop, located on Shangtang Street outside Changmen, is an old shop with over 30 years of history. Recently, it suddenly went bankrupt. Wang Qianfu, the shareholder and manager of the shop, retained lawyer Lu Xiangru to announce the liquidation. It is rumored that the shop has debts of over 70,000 yuan. The creditors believe that the shop's business operations were not loss-making, but that the manager personally lost over 30,000 yuan, leading to a cash flow problem. They have retained lawyer  Kuan to file a lawsuit with the district court to place a lien on the shop and investigate the accounts. The shop's 20 employees have not been dismissed since the bankruptcy, but they have no means of support. Manager Wang is avoiding meeting them, so they have petitioned the county party headquarters for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Arrest of the Main Culprit in the Murder Case in Ximen, Wuxi <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Chen Wang, the mistress of Chen Tingji Woodworks located in Li Lane near Baciao Bridge outside Ximen (57 years old), was suddenly attacked in the head with three axe blows and died at midnight on the 26th of this month. The murderer fled the scene. The next day, the fourth public security bureau in charge of the area, suspecting Chen Cuiyun, the daughter of the deceased, arrested her and brought her to the bureau for questioning. The head of the district also reported the situation of the autopsy to the court. Since the case occurred, Fan Xin, the director of the fourth public security bureau, immediately started the investigation and repeatedly questioned Chen Cuiyun, obtaining clues. Chen Qibao (also known as Feng Qibao), nephew of the deceased, was suspected of committing the murder. The night before, he personally led the police to Chen's house and arrested Qibao. Under Cuiyun's pillow, they found a letter from Chen Xueqin (also known as Cuiyun) to Feng Luan (also known as Qibao), a flashlight, and a pocket watch. Under the mattress, they found a dirty cloth stained with blood and yellow filth. He immediately took them to the bureau. Cuiyun and Qibao were interrogated separately and strictly. They confessed that Cuiyun and Qibao had an incestuous relationship. Because Chen Wang (the deceased) discovered the relationship, they planned the murder. A few days ago, Wang asked Qibao for four yuan and five jiao in membership fees, which led to an argument, so Qibao's murderous intent grew stronger. That night, he broke into the room with an axe, giving Wang three axe blows. Cuiyun had helped remove the window lock, etc. After receiving the confession, Director Fan believed that the truth was revealed and presented both criminals to the general bureau, and today transferred them to the county court for trial. It is said that Chen Qibao's killing of his aunt was not only due to the incestuous relationship with Cuiyun but also due to a dispute over inheritance.</p>

<p>In the Hehua Pond area of Yangjiaqiao Township, District 8 of the county, Qian Sanquan, a 79-year-old villager, had three sons, all farmers, and a poor family. Father and sons were not harmonious. The other night, Sanquan took a bowl, filled it with  rice husk ash, and placed it in his bedding as a foot warmer because of the cold weather. Inadvertently, he knocked the bowl over, scorching the bedding, which spread to the mosquito net. The fire blazed fiercely and became a prairie fire. Sanquan was old and frail, and his movements were slow. He could only shout for help. His son, A Yu, woke up in surprise upon hearing the sound and immediately drew water to extinguish the fire, preventing a major disaster. However, Sanquan's body had been burned by the fire and soaked in water, leading to a fire poison attacking his heart, and he died yesterday. It was a tragic event.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Verdict in the South Gate Murder Case <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>He Xihu, a resident of South Gate in this county, was suspected in the case of the death of a young woman, Wang Aihu, who fell into the river. He was taken into custody by the county court. Recently, the prosecutor's office investigated the case and found that Wang's death was not related to He, so he was not prosecuted. However, he was prosecuted in the criminal court for the crime of enticing a woman under the age of twenty. After repeated trials by Judge Lai, the debate concluded on the 26th of this month. Yesterday (30th) at 10:00 AM, the sentencing was held, and Judge Lai sentenced He Xihu to two years and eight months of imprisonment. He refused to accept the sentence and stated in court that he would appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Building a Dam and Sluice Gate at Majishan, Changzhou <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Majishan in District 11 of Wujin is isolated in the East Taihu Lake. During the spring and autumn seasons, the mountains are clear and the water is beautiful, and the scenery is excellent. It has always been known as a paradise. However, the farmland around the mountain along the lake, about 6,000 mu, is flooded every time the lake overflows. The mountain people watch helplessly as the torrent is unstoppable, resulting in huge losses. Qian Linshu, a member of the Rural Improvement Committee, recognizing this, invited County Magistrate Cai and others to inspect the area for a week and designed a dam and sluice gate to prevent floods. The estimated cost is about 16,000 yuan, which is difficult for the villagers to bear.

<p>After the Tiansunjin Silk Shop on Yuanmen Bridge in the city went bankrupt, silk factories and trading houses from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Danyang, and Zhenjiang sent representatives to Yangzhou to negotiate the debts. The night before, together with members of the Chamber of Commerce, they sealed the shop's cabinets, but were stopped by the liquidator. It has been learned that the shop owes a total of 50,000 yuan this time. The factories and trading houses account for one-third of the total amount, and the rest are owed to local money shops and depositors. The shop's inventory is less than 10,000 yuan, so the factories and trading houses are extremely worried. They have retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court and have also written to the Chamber of Commerce stating the suspicious inside story of the bankruptcy and requesting an investigation of the accounts in order to conduct a public audit. The Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the letter to the Public Security Bureau, and each has sent one police officer to guard the shop and ensure that the stored goods are not moved without authorization.

<h3 id="e111">Successful Test Flight of China National Aviation Corporation's Southwest Route <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Nie Kaiyi and An Lisheng Returned to Shanghai at 5 PM Yesterday</p>
<p>Official Opening Still Awaiting Company Meeting Decision</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that An Lisheng, chief pilot of the China National Aviation Corporation, and Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the aviation team, who conducted the test flight to Kunming for the purpose of opening the southwest route, returned to Shanghai at 4:40 PM yesterday. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Itinerary <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. An Lisheng and Mr. Nie Kaiyi, accompanied by Mr. Huang Baoxian, head of the sales team, took the company's No. 11 Sikorsky aircraft to Guangzhou on December 27th last year at around 7:00 AM. On the 31st, they encountered fog over Longzhou and were forced to land in Kao Bang, French Indochina. On January 19th of this year, they flew from Kao Bang to Kunming, and on the 26th, they flew from Kunming to Chengdu. On the 29th at 8:00 AM, they flew from Chengdu to Chongqing. At 12:45 PM that day, they took off from Chongqing and arrived in Yichang at 4:10 PM. On the 30th (yesterday) at 8:05 AM, they took off from Yichang, arrived in Hankou at 10:00 AM, took off from Hankou at 10:50 AM, arrived in Nanjing at 3:00 PM, added some engine oil, and flew to Shanghai, arriving at Longhua Airport at 4:40 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The company was informed of the arrival time of Mr. An and Mr. Nie. Important officials rushed to Longhua Airport to wait. All the staff of the aviation team stationed in Longhua also came to the airport to welcome them. After the plane landed at 4:40 PM, Mr. An and Mr. Nie got off the plane and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Mr. Nie Kaiyi immediately telephoned Mr. Dai Enji, general manager of the company, to report that he would go to the company to report everything in person. Mr. An Lisheng, on the other hand, had been driving the plane for days and was very tired, so he briefly interacted with the welcomers and returned home to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Report <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Nie Kaiyi immediately took a car to the company to report the details of the test flight and the obstruction in Vietnam to General Manager Dai Enji. Then he went to his office, briefly inspected the accumulated documents, and gave the following interview to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Passing Guilin <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Nie said that on December 31st of last year, he flew from western Guangdong and over Longzhou in Guangxi. Looking down at the airfield, there were over a thousand people doing construction work. He wanted to stop, but the airfield construction was not completed and there were many workers, making it inconvenient to land. He wanted to fly, but strange peaks rose from time to time and the weather turned worse. Moreover, he was flying west out of Pingguan and had reached the territory of French Indochina.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Obstruction in Vietnam <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At 12:00 noon, the mountains were stacked on top of each other, the fog was thick, and the clouds were low. It was impossible to advance. He wanted to return to Longzhou, but he was afraid that there would not be enough engine oil to add. Just as he felt trapped, he suddenly found an airfield below. Although he knew it was French territory, he was forced to land. He believed that the authorities would understand. However, after landing, the local authorities in Kao Bang detained the plane. Mr. An and Mr. Nie were also hosted in separate rooms. After a week, the authorities agreed to take the train to Hanoi to negotiate the release of the plane with French Governor Daladier. Daladier said that foreign planes were absolutely not allowed to land without permission. Since they had mistakenly entered French territory, they would need a telegram from the Chinese government proving their background and requesting their release before they could comply. At this point, they began to see a glimmer of hope for the release of the plane, so they telegraphed the company. Another week passed until January 15th, when they received the French authorities' message that they would release the plane. They took a train back to Kao Bang, near Lang Son, on the 17th and arrived on the afternoon of the 18th. On the 19th, they flew to Kunming.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Climate <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In Kao Bang, it rained lightly all day long. The ancient poem says that the land is close to the sky and it rains all year round, which is similar to what the Huayang Kingdom Chronicles says that there are no three sunny days in a row. From there, flying to Kunming, the high mountains were almost 6,200 feet above sea level. The air in Yunnan is thin. The plane descends quickly and ascends with difficulty. It took four attempts to ascend from Kunming. Therefore, this route must be flown with a large engine aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Contact <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>We stayed in Kunming for a week and were treated well by Chairman Long Yun. He also inquired in detail about the opening of the route. The Kunming authorities are eager for this route to be opened as soon as possible so that they can communicate smoothly with the central government and so that messengers can avoid the inconvenience and time-consuming detours of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. After contacting them, we immediately returned to Sichuan. Although the original plan was to go to Guiyang, we didn't have to go again this time because the mountains were too high and the climate was not good, and we had already conducted a test flight to Guizhou before.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Route <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>After the southwest route is opened in the future, will it go from Guangzhou or Chengdu? It will be necessary to report the test flight to the Ministry of Communications for a decision. Flying from Guangdong will have bad weather, while flying from Sichuan must pass through Zhaotong, where the mountains are 8,600 feet above sea level, making it difficult to fly.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Change of Aircraft <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The aircraft that Mr. An and Mr. Nie took when they left was the No. 11 Sikorsky, while the one they took back to Shanghai yesterday was the No. 12 Sikorsky. It had been exchanged in Chongqing because the components of the No. 11 aircraft were more sensitive, which was more convenient for flying in the heavily mountainous area. In addition to the fact that Ms. Xia Pu, an American company employee, and Mr. Zeng Tong, a Chinese, came with Mr. An and Mr. Nie yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Zhang Xueliang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Issue of His Employment Has Been Resolved</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Xueliang of the Central Supervisory Committee attended the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing and met with the central authorities. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by night train from Beijing at 7:20 AM yesterday. He got off at Zhenru Station. Those who went to Zhenru Station to welcome him included Zhu Guangmu, former secretary general of Zhang's office, Wu Xiangding, Yang Hu, director of the municipal security office, Wen Hongen, director of the public security bureau, and Li Dachao, section chief of the municipal government.

After getting off the train, Mr. Zhang went directly to his residence on Moliai Road to rest. Regarding the issue of Mr. Zhang's employment, after this meeting between Chiang and Zhang in Beijing, the central government has decided to have Mr. Zhang assist Chairman Chiang in handling the suppression of communist bandits. The official announcement is expected to be made in the near future. Zhang is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today to visit scenic spots. In addition to Mr. Zhang, Lu Dipeng, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, also left Beijing for Shanghai on the same train yesterday. He has already taken a train back to Hangzhou.</p>

<p>Wang Shouting and Lin Guogeng Went to Beijing</p>
<p>Chen Jiliang Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>Riri News Agency reports that Wang Shouting, the newly appointed Commander of the Naval Training Fleet, arrived in Shanghai to take office. He then received a telegram from Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan, and yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he went to Beijing with Lin Guogeng, the Commander of Xiamen Naval Port, to discuss matters related to the coastal defense of Fujian and Xiamen. A Riri News Agency reporter met with Commander Wang at the Gaoyang Temple Fleet Headquarters yesterday morning and inquired about the recent situation in Fujian and Xiamen. It was also learned that Li Mengbin, the Commander of Mawei Naval Port, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the Hai Rong warship, preparing to go to Beijing within days to assume the position of Director of the Military Audit Department. Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet, will also arrive in Shanghai within days. The following is a record of their conversations:</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wang and Lin Jointly Go to Beijing <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang first stated, "After returning to Shanghai from Xiamen, I originally intended to go to Beijing immediately to report everything to the Navy Department. However, due to handling matters related to the turnover of the training fleet, I was unable to spare the time. Now that I have taken office, things have been somewhat settled. Minister Chen (Shaokuan) telegraphed the night before last, summoning me to Beijing to discuss the deployment of coastal defense in Fujian and Xiamen in the future. It has been decided that this afternoon (the 30th) at 3:00 PM, I will leave Shanghai by train. Lin Guogeng, the Commander of Xiamen Naval Port, came to Shanghai yesterday (the 29th) to also discuss matters with the Navy Department and will be traveling with me. Li Mengbin, the Commander of Mawei Naval Port, who has been transferred to the position of Director of the Military Audit Department of the Navy Department, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 30th) at 8:00 AM aboard the Hai Rong warship from Mawei. He originally intended to travel to Beijing together to assume his new post, but due to a cold, he plans to seek medical treatment in Shanghai and will go to Beijing after recovering in two or three days."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Recent Situation in Fujian and Xiamen <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>"After the military operations in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places concluded, the local area is extremely peaceful, and everything has returned to its original state. Except for the coastal defense, which is the responsibility of the Navy, the security rights of the cities of Fujian and Xiamen and all administrative agencies are ready to be handed over to the local government. In Mawei, Li Shijia is currently serving as the Commander of the Naval Port and concurrently the Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of the Marine Corps. After Li arrives in Fujian, he will be stationed in Mawei to engage in training to consolidate defense. As for the position of Provincial Government Committee Member, he will go to the province to work when necessary. In this suppression of the Fujian rebellion, in terms of rewarding meritorious service, the naval officers and soldiers absolutely dare not claim credit, because defending the country is the duty of soldiers, and it is also due to the appropriate handling by the central authorities. For two months, the Navy recovered Fujian and Xiamen without bloodshed. On the surface, it seems that not much effort was spent, but that is not the case. It is best and the highest purpose of using troops because the rebels were forced to collapse, avoiding the prolongation of war and affecting the people."</p>

<p>"Now that I have taken office as the Commander of the Training Fleet, my responsibility is to train the navy and consolidate national defense. I plan to start active training from today. The ships belonging to the training fleet include the Ying Rui, Tong Ji, Jing An, and other ships. Except for the Tong Ji, which is being repaired at the Gaoyang Temple Shipyard and will be completed next month, the other ships are mostly patrolling outside. As for the torpedo team, it has been ordered to be abolished to save expenses. The ships have been separately assigned to various fleets. The Jian Kang has been assigned to the jurisdiction of the First Fleet. The Hu Peng, Hu Sun, Hu E, and Hu Ying, the four torpedo boats, have been assigned to the jurisdiction of the Second Fleet."</p>

<p>"As for the local security and administrative responsibilities after the recovery of Fuzhou, they were temporarily the responsibility of Chen Jiliang, the Commander of the First Fleet. Now that the newly appointed Chairman of Fujian Province, Chen Yi, has arrived in Fujian, and the establishment of the provincial government is imminent, and someone is responsible for all local political affairs, it has been decided that Chen will take the Hai Chou government ship to Shanghai within days to continue his responsibilities for the defense of Songhu. After Commander Chen arrives in Shanghai, I will set out again to patrol and train the various ships. As for where to set out, it has not been ordered and is still difficult to determine."</p>

<h3 id="e131">Gathering Crowds for抢Transporting <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Shi Dengfu, the foreman of the Hongtai Yuji Shoulder Transport Company, led unemployed workers in December last year to搶shoulder transport work from the shoulder carriers and handcart drivers of the rice shops, which led to disputes. After the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the City Party Department and the Public Security Bureau, conducted mediation and decided on four solutions, the matter came to an end. At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the foreman Shi Dengfu again led more than 200 unemployed workers to gather at the Suzhou River Rice Industry Wharf, claiming that according to the mediation record of the Social Affairs Bureau, they wanted to be安置. The order was disrupted at the time. The rice shops, fearing that unfortunate incidents would occur, notified the rice boats to announce the suspension of unloading. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 100 unemployed workers gathered again, wearing red-edged blue vests, and rushed forward to搶work while the shoulder carriers were unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Fights Occurred <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Seeing the unemployed workers coming aggressively, the shoulder carriers and handcart drivers of the rice shops announced the suspension of unloading. More and more workers gathered on both sides, and the confrontational situation was extremely serious. At that time, the unemployed workers first started arguing. After a disagreement, they resorted to violence. The order was chaotic for a while. Both sides fought each other with carrying poles and shoulder poles. Pedestrians and vehicles dodged to both sides, causing traffic to be cut off in the area of the New Zha Gate Bridge and Datong Road.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Injury Investigation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>During the fighting, quite a few unemployed workers were injured. It is learned that the names of the injured include Li Tianhao, Chen Fuyuan, Jiang Xiubo, Chen Dayuan, Sun Shangkui, and others. All of their heads were seriously injured. Jiang Changkun, Yi Jinsong, Sun Yazi, Liu Xiaozhi, Sun Chuanxing, Jiang Tianming, and others also suffered injuries to their feet and waists. However, Leng Shanlin and Xu Songlin were the most seriously injured, and there was fear for their lives. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police to transport all the injured to the Second Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Carter Road for treatment. Leng Shanlin and Xu Songlin were hospitalized for treatment due to their serious injuries. The other workers were bandaged by doctors and discharged from the hospital immediately. After being interrogated by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, they were sent to the local court for examination of injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Military Police Suppression <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After hearing the news, Lai Gang, the director of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, immediately led more than 30 police officers to suppress the violence, but the number of people was too large to control. He immediately telegraphed Wu, the captain of the Second Squadron of the Security Brigade, to dispatch a team to suppress the violence together. After learning about this, Wen Hongen, the director of the City Public Security Bureau, also ordered the police brigade to dispatch more than 20 police officers to ride in a security vehicle to the area to distribute and strictly guard the area. It was not until after 11:00 AM that the workers on both sides were dispersed separately.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Detain and Interrogate <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>After the shoulder carriers and handcart drivers caused the above disturbances, the Fourth District Public Security Bureau dispatched police to arrest Yi Guocai, a handcart driver, and Zhang Caiyuan, Chen Fuyuan, Li Tianhao, Jiang Changkun, Li Zhengbang, Xu Zhonglin, Liu Xueren, Xue Deshi, Li Jinsong, Chen Dayuan, Sun Chengkui, Xiao San, Wang Guangfu, Leng Hai, Jiang Xiubo, Shen Fugao, Deng Zhikuan, and 18 others, including a mute. More than a dozen of them were slightly or seriously injured, and two iron bars, two iron hooks, and two bamboo boards were found. According to the statements of the handcart drivers and shoulder carriers, each made excuses. They were ordered to be escorted to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It was also heard that there were still several people who were more seriously injured, and the fire brigade dispatched ambulances to send them to the hospital for treatment. Afterward, Director Wen Hongen immediately issued a hand order to investigate and arrest Gao Qifeng, the head of the rice merchants in Zhabei, who started the incident. Director Lai dispatched Officer Mu to lead the police to arrest Gao. According to his confession,</p>
<p>He is 38 years old and from Gaoyou. He refused to confess to the fighting between the handcart drivers and the shoulder carriers. It is now known that the Zhabei Rice Grain Association and various rice shops have dispatched a security team to protect them.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Financial Strike <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The rice shops and manufacturers from the north end of the New Zha Gate Bridge to Wuzhen Road on Guangfu Road were indignant at this situation and announced a general strike at noon to await the resolution of the party and government agencies. The Dagon News Agency reporter went to the area to investigate separately. The closed shops included Wanshengtai, Yutai Xing, Fengtai, Changfeng, Yiqingshun, Yidachang, Runyu, Dade, Damao, Hengkang, Zhicheng, Tongxinggong, Wanyuanhe, Daxin, Rentai, Yuanfeng, Juxingsheng, Yongshuntai, Xiechangde, Defeng, Yuchangxiang, Ruichangfa, Yisheng, Yusheng, Dayouheng, Hefengtai, Hongchang, and more than 30 others. The signboards were also all tightly closed. Yesterday, more than 30 rice boats arriving at the Suzhou River also completely suspended unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Emergency Meeting <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After all the rice industry firms and factories went on strike, an emergency meeting was held at 2:00 PM at the Doumi Guild Hall on Kulun Road in Zhabei to discuss countermeasures. More than 50 representatives of the rice industry firms and factories, including Jiang Shizhi and Fu Qiangen, were present. Lu Jingwen was elected as the chairman to report that the unemployed workers had repeatedly harassed them and that the rice merchants had painfully suspended business. It was decided to take the following measures: (1) According to the last joint meeting resolution, all business will be suspended to await resolution. (2) Lu Jingwen and Jiang Shizhi were elected as representatives to petition party and government agencies to demand a cessation of the disturbances in order to maintain business. (3) If there is no effective solution, the market will not be opened. (4) A letter will be sent to the rice merchants in South Shanghai to express unanimous agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Petitioning the Authorities <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The rice industry firms and factories, because Shi Dengfu repeatedly interfered with business, the conference elected representatives Jiang Shizhi, Lu Jingwen, and others to petition the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center at 3:00 PM. Wang Xianqing, the mediation director of the Third Section, received them. The rice industry representatives reported the situation of the disturbances and immediately presented five demands: (1) Before the case is resolved, all workers in Shi Dengfu's group wearing numbered uniforms must not go to the Wusong River Rice Industry Wharf again. (2) If Shi Dengfu's group of workers goes to the Rice Industry Wharf again, the police must arrest them immediately. (3) Shi Dengfu's license should be revoked immediately. (4) All firms and factories are unwilling to do business until they receive effective guarantees. (5) If the North Shanghai issue cannot be resolved tomorrow, the South Shanghai side will also follow suit. Mr. Wang persuaded the rice merchants to open the market first. The Social Affairs Bureau will transfer the matter to the Public Security Bureau and send police to protect them. All other issues will be resolved appropriately in the near future. The representatives returned until after 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Business Resumes Today <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>After all the rice industry firms and factories went on strike yesterday, the matter was very important for the people's livelihood. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for protection, and police have been dispatched to maintain order. It has been decided to open the market at 8:00 AM this morning. Other issues will be resolved by the authorities.</p>
<p>Chairman Liu of Henan</p>
<h3 id="e140">Visited Shanghai National Goods Company Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Establish Henan National Goods Market</p>
<p>Sincerely Implement Saving the Country Through Production</p>
<p>Liu Zhi, the chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, is very enthusiastic about promoting national goods. After the national crisis, he increasingly felt the importance of developing national goods. Making efforts in production is the key to saving the people's livelihood and building national power today. When Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, and others initiated the China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company in Shanghai, Chairman Liu was the first to promote and join the initiative. Later, the remittances and share subscriptions from military and political circles also started with Chairman Liu. Because the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has concluded and he has come to Shanghai, through Mr. Yin Weichang's notification of the Production and Sales Company, it was decided to visit the Shanghai National Goods Company yesterday afternoon. Wu Zhihao, the standing director of the company, and Wu Tingsheng, the general manager, arrived at the Shanghai National Goods Company to wait, and were received by Lu Qisheng and Zhu Dechao. Chairman Liu expressed his great appreciation for the service spirit of the male and female employees of the company. He generally appreciated and cherished the various cheap and beautiful national goods he saw, and immediately selected more than ten kinds of electric jade and electric wood utensils from Yaguang Factory and more than 余疋 of Xuechi呢 from Zhenxing Factory. Afterward, he went to the manager's office to discuss the preparation for the establishment of a Henan National Goods Market, in order to sincerely implement the government's proposition of saving the country through production. Chairman Liu also said that several factories were established in Henan to try out the policy of employing soldiers in industry. He hoped that the Production and Sales Company would send personnel to visit and seek cooperation. It is reported that the Production and Sales Company will send representatives together with the Shanghai National Goods Company to prepare for the establishment of a market, and plans are already underway.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shengsan, an Elder, is Scheduled to Open His Funeral</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Shengsan, a respected elder in Shanghai, whose taboo name was Fenggao, was from the Fahua Town of Shanghai. He studied at the Tongwen Guan in his youth and was a pioneer in the study of European languages by Chinese people. In the fifteenth year of Guangxu, he followed Xue Taichang Fucheng of Wuxi on a mission to the four countries of England, France, Italy, and Belgium, providing much assistance. He then requested leave to return to China in the twenty-first year of Guangxu. At that time, Sheng Gongbao Yihuai of Wujin was revitalizing industry. Hearing of Mr. Wang's talent, he was appointed to assist in the exploration of coal and iron mines. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, Scholar Cai Jun was ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan and奏appointed Mr. Wang as参赞. Later, he was reassigned as the Consul General in Yokohama. In the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu, he returned to China to take the examination and was awarded the eighteenth place舉人. After the庚子Rebellion, the Qing court tried hard to innovate, and an edict was issued to派戴尚书Hongci and Duan Zhijun Fang to serve as ambassadors to Europe and the United States to investigate politics. Mr. Wang was appointed as参赞. Wherever the official car went, he was given实星 by the governments of Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, and Austria. After returning to China in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, he was soon awarded the second-rank顶戴浙江 candidate道because of his labor. In Zhejiang, he successively served as the head of the Provincial Police Bureau, the head of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Bureau, the head of the Telephone Bureau, and the head of the Provincial Foreign Affairs Bureau and the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Mines. He founded a new government, not avoiding labor and resentment. He was granted the title of Zhejiang 交涉使 in the second year of Xuantong. He successively ordered the Japanese merchants in Hangzhou and Jiangshan to move and close, and recovered the Baoshi Mountain in West Lake, the Yanji Mountain in Gongchen Bridge, the Haidao in Huzhou, and the Yin Mountain in Taizhou. His deeds were recorded and praised. After the鼎革, in the seventh year of the Republic of China, he was reappointed as Zhejiang Special 交涉员 for seven years. He was awarded the second-class 大綬嘉禾章 for his labor. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, after the May 30th Massacre occurred, the students of St. John's University in Shanghai clashed with the president and the entire school withdrew. Mr. Wang, old but strong, saw righteousness and acted bravely. He donated 100 acres of his ancestors' cemetery to found Guanghua University. The school, now standing on the Daxi Road in West Shanghai, is the crystallization of Mr. Wang's efforts. When the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Wang, with his high age and great reputation, was pushed to act as the Director of the Songhu Commercial Port. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, he was appointed as the Director of the Hubei Provincial Parcel Tax Bureau. He suffered a stroke in the autumn of the following year and returned to Shanghai to recuperate. He eventually passed away on the 23rd day of November last winter due to his declining physical strength, at the age of seventy-six. He had four sons. Looking at Mr. Wang's life, he served the country and society, and his career was remarkable. He can be passed down in history. Moreover, he was generous and righteous, and treated people with sincerity. Those who knew him all respected and loved him. He was not only known for his diplomatic progress. It is now heard that Mr. Wang's family has chosen February 1st to open the funeral at the Hushe at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, and February 2nd at the Buddhist Jingye Society at 480 Hard Road. Mr. Wang has acquaintances all over Shanghai, and it is expected that there will be a grand scene of plain cars and white horses at that time.</p>

<p>City Chamber of Commerce Telegram Request</p>
<h3 id="e143">Striving for a Reduction in German Egg Tax <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Should be in Accordance with the Principle of Equality and Mutual Benefit</p>
<p>Please Order the German Ambassador to Pay Attention When Concluding the Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing yesterday, "[To the] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing, On the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Egg Industry Association, stating that, according to the Havas News Agency report on January 24th, the Sino-German Commercial Treaty has expired, and the Chinese ambassador to Germany is conducting a renewal in Berlin. Upon investigation, in recent years, our country's exports of eggs and egg products have plummeted. Just taking exports to Germany as an example, in 1932, the German government increased the import tax on Chinese frozen eggs to 65 marks per 100 kilograms, which is 650 marks per ton (1,000 kilograms). The tax on fresh eggs was increased to 70 marks per 100 kilograms. This heavy tax far exceeds the cost of Chinese eggs arriving in Germany, which is tantamount to prohibiting the import of our country's eggs and eggs. Therefore, the trade of Chinese eggs to Germany is almost completely cut off. (According to recent customs records, there has been an increase in Chinese eggs transported to Germany, but in fact, the number of eggs sold directly to Germany is very small. Most of the Chinese eggs are first transported to the Hamburg docks. Hamburg is a free port, and goods only go to the docks without going through customs. Sales to Germany do not incur taxes. After Chinese eggs go to the docks, they are transported to nearby countries depending on the needs.) The German government offers special preferential treatment for taxes levied on eggs and egg products transported to German customs from other countries. For example, Chinese fresh eggs are taxed at 70 marks per 100 kilograms, while those transported from the Netherlands or other countries are only taxed at 30 marks per 100 kilograms. This unequal treatment violates the principle of mutual trade benefits. It has also been found that in the past three years, China-Germany trade has been completely in deficit in our country, and Germany has always been in a favorable position. German goods exported to China are always three times more than Chinese goods exported to Germany. A comparative table of China-Germany trade from 1930 to 1932 is as follows: (The figures on the left are in customs silver)</p>
<p>Year German Goods Exported to China Chinese Goods Exported to Germany Our Country's Deficit</p>
<p>1930 69,000,000 taels 23,360,000 45,640,000</p>
<p>1931 83,500,000 23,138,000 60,362,000</p>
<p>1932 71,800,000 29,824,000 41,976,000</p>
<p>Looking at the table on the right, German goods flooded into China in the past three years, with a total deficit of about 147 million taels. The export of Chinese goods to Germany is getting worse. Looking at our country's rural economy, it has been extremely depressed, and the farmers in the 18 provinces of the ministry who rely on eggs as a side product for their livelihoods are countless. Since the foreign trade of eggs and egg products has been subject to various blows, the farmers have fallen into even greater distress. If we want to revive the countryside, there are many ways to do it, but restoring the foreign trade of eggs and egg products is an urgent measure. For this reason, we urgently sent this letter to your association, imploring you to quickly电通知 our country's ambassador to Germany to do its utmost to protect our country's trade in eggs to Germany in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit when renewing the Sino-German Commercial Treaty. Considering the past comparison of trade between the two countries, Germany is already in a favorable position, and the German government should improve the treatment of Chinese egg imports. Even if it cannot offer special preferential treatment, it should at least treat the import of eggs from other countries to Germany in the same way, which is reasonable. It has been found that Article 1, paragraph 2 of the new agreement on tariff issues signed between China and Germany in the 17th year of the Republic of China states that one of the contracting states, under any circumstances, may not levy higher or different taxes, internal taxes, or any donations on the goods transported and exported by the people of the other country within its territory than those paid by its own people or the people of any other country. According to this agreement, the taxes levied by Germans on Chinese eggs transported to Germany must not be higher or different than those of other countries. We request that your ministry电notify the embassy in Germany, ordering it to strive for this and pay attention when revising the new treaty, which is a public matter. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce叩艶."</p>
<p>National Production Conference</p>
<h3 id="e144">Exchanged Views with Industrial Department Yesterday <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Hosted Banquet for Director of Industry Department Liu Yin Fu</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the National Production Conference, after the appointment of the preparatory committee, yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, specially hosted a banquet for Liu Yinfu, the director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, at the Yiyou Club on Hankou Road, and exchanged views. The following is a record of Director Liu's speech:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Hosting Banquet for Mr. Liu <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory committee and conveners of the National Production Conference hosted a banquet for Liu Yinfu, the director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, at the Yiyou Club on Hankou Road yesterday at 7:00 PM, and held a conversation meeting during the banquet. The attendees included Guo Shun, Wang Yunwu, Wu Yun Chu, Qian Chengxu, Hu Xiyuan, Mu Ouchu, Rong Zongjing, and Director Liu, totaling more than 20 people. It is heard that as a result of the exchange of views, regarding (1) the scope of the proposals and the conference expenses, considerable decisions have been made in principle.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Director Liu Speaks <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Director Liu told a reporter from the New Sound Society that the convocation of this production conference was originally based on proposals from Central Committee members such as Sun Zhesheng and Wu Chaoshu during the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, in order to save our country's declining production crisis. The list of conveners for each province and city was determined entirely according to the state of industrial development in each province and city, with more from those that are more developed and fewer from those that are less developed. Those invited are all respected figures in the industrial sector. It is hoped that this conference will pay more attention to the environment and factual aspects, avoid empty talk and useless general proposals, and hope that it will be easier to promote and implement in the future. In my opinion, the general key points of the scope of discussion for this conference can be divided into two categories: (A) Regarding economic aspects, such as (1) how to invite the financial sector to invest in domestic production enterprises, (2) implementing tariff protection policies and reducing tax rates on produced goods, and (3) transportation issues related to transportation; (B) Regarding the manufacturers themselves, such as (1) improvements in management systems related to organizational aspects, reforms in accounting systems, and improvements in sales methods, (2) product improvements related to technical aspects, and (3) how to develop domestic raw materials. The reason why our country has actually declined in recent years and has not been able to make significant progress is partly due to various political factors, and partly due to the failure of manufacturers themselves to have sound organization, which is also a major reason. Observing the development of foreign industries in China, although there are differences in circumstances, in terms of all organization and technology, they are superior to us. Therefore, whatever the outcome of this conference, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce generally hopes that manufacturers can devote themselves to this.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Ammonium Sulfate Plant <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>He continued, saying that the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is now doing its best to stand in a promoting position to advance various industries. Since the January 28th Incident, it has deeply felt the lack of raw materials in industry, especially during the intense Shanghai battle, the principle of ammonium sulfate, a major item, encountered great difficulties. If a remedy is not sought quickly, it will be related to national defense, which is no small matter. Therefore, in view of this, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce immediately began preparing to establish its own ammonium sulfate plant. Since the start of the project, many foreign merchants have been willing to invest. After deliberation, it was decided that it would be run purely by domestic commercial shares, with a total capital of 10 million yuan. The investors are all from the financial and industrial sectors. Recently, the Central Political Conference decided to establish it within one year, so it is expected that it will be gradually realized soon.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Establishing an Alcohol Plant <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>He also said that since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce took the initiative to set up an alcohol plant, many people in Shanghai and other parts of the country have been willing to open one. However, in order to take into account the actual needs of the country, one plant will still be jointly operated by government and business, with exclusive operation. For the time being, no other alcohol plants will be allowed to be established in the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, so as to avoid the historical senseless competition of Chinese merchants, resulting in the disadvantage of oversupply. However, in the future, if the need arises and the supply is insufficient, temporary flexible measures can also be taken. Since preparations began, the date of establishment is not far off.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Central Machine Factory <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>As for the Central Machine Factory, since it was decided to proceed with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, in the future, the procurement of materials for machinery will be handled by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Purchasing Committee. Preparations have been completed. Although the factory site was previously selected in the city of Nanjing, one reason is that the terrain needs to be higher, and the second is to consider the convenience of purchasers, so it is still under study. Once the factory site is determined, the construction funds are raised, and the machinery is ready, it only needs to be formally notified and can be transported within three months. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce also hopes to realize it within this year. As for the steel plant issue, it is of great importance and requires careful study. It is too early to say when it will be signed.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Factory Inspection <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Finally, it was also stated in response that the issue of factory inspection in the Shanghai Municipal Council concession had been progressing very smoothly on both sides. However, due to the issue of jurisdiction on the concession side, obstacles occurred, delaying it to this day. However, because this matter falls within the scope of the Labor Department, I am not very familiar with it. However, I understand that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is determined to promote this measure because it concerns the welfare and safety of workers, and will soon renegotiate a compromise with the Shanghai concession authorities.</p>
<p>The Tragic Situation in the Disaster Area Around Dongping</p>
<h3 id="e151">Xiong Xiling Pleads for the Disaster Victims <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Five Cents to Save a Life</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Jinan Red Swastika Society yesterday, stating that according to the inspection of various counties in the Dongping area by relief workers Kong Huihang and Hou Susuang, the area is still a vast expanse of water, and tens of thousands of affected compatriots are suffering from cold and hunger, and many are dying. It is currently surveyed that grain prices there are very cheap and living is very simple. Five dimes can save a life. Please widely solicit donations so that those who survive the ice and snow can all have access to relief. The merit is immeasurable, etc. It is heard that after receiving the telegram, the Society immediately convened an emergency meeting, first allocating 2,000 yuan for emergency relief. On the one hand, it published a notice soliciting donations, and on the other hand, Chairman Xiong Xiling asked various charitable organizations to solicit donations for the disaster victims. Charitable people at sea will surely be happy to contribute to this act of saving a life with five cents, in order to save the dying disaster victims.</p>

<p>Luo Zhangrong, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of Zhu Fohai, Commander-in-Chief of the Resist-Japan Volunteers, and Deputy Commander Jin Qifeng cabled from Peiping (above omitted). Recently, according to a telegram from the front line Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Liu Hongji, Chief of Staff of the Third Route Bandit Suppression of the Xiang-Qian Border Region, has always been enthusiastic about the revolutionary bandit suppression work and has a long history. He has also been telegraphed to appoint Mr. Liu as the Chief of Staff of the Sixth Route. Recently, the Japanese and puppet forces have been rampant on the front line. I hope to go north quickly to urge subordinates to direct the killing of enemies.</p>

<p>Continued News on the Interruption of Navigation in Madang due to Shallow Water</p>
<p>Difficulty in Rescuing Stranded Vessels</p>
<p>Unpredictable Changes in Lao Xingang</p>
<p>The shallow water and interrupted navigation on the Yangtze River have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a continuation of the news:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Jianguo Escapes Danger and Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River vessel Jianguo was delayed due to being blocked by shallow water in Madang. It was only after the Anqing branch sent a ship to tow it that the Jianguo was pulled away from the shoal. It did not enter the port until yesterday afternoon, arriving more than thirty hours late. After unloading the cargo today, the ship will enter the factory for repairs. The Sanbei Songpu vessel was also blocked in Madang. It later went to Jiujiang, unloaded cargo, and reduced the load before setting sail. It did not arrive until yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Four Ships Rescue Changxing <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Changxing vessel has been stranded in Madang for three days. It was not until yesterday that the Sanbei vessel was sent to tow it, but to no avail. Later, Hankou also sent the shallow water Yongkang vessel to tow it, but it still could not be towed away from the shoal. Now, the Sanbei vessel is being used to unload its cargo. The bureau has also transferred the Fuyang vessel to unload and tow. As the passengers on the ship have been delayed for many days, the Jing'an vessel was ordered to transfer them. The passengers will go to Hankou first, while rescue efforts continue.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Madang Water Gauge Report <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>It is found that the shallowest point in Madang is 45 and a half miles upstream of Anqing, 7 and a half miles from Xiaogushan, and 45 miles from Jiujiang upstream. There was originally an old channel there. A new port was opened last year, which could be two hours faster. The old port is arc-shaped and the new port is straight. Now the new port water is shallower and ships are prohibited from going up and down. The old port is still used. Yesterday's water gauge report stated that the water had dropped to only 9 feet 1 inch. The second telegram said that it was 9 feet 3 inches, but it was still impossible to navigate.</p>
<h3 id="e157">All Four Hong Vessels Blocked <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's upper river shallow water vessels Hongyuan, Hongzhen, Hongli, and Hongheng are all blocked due to the Yangtze River's shallow water. These four vessels are more suitable for sailing downstream. Unexpectedly, in the Xindi area, because they were carrying salt into Hunan, they were all blocked and none could sail downstream. Yesterday, China Merchants' Jianghua vessel still set sail, but only went to Anqing, using barges to transport cargo. Jianghua sailed empty upstream to load cargo to Hankou.</p>
<p>Shanghai Emergency Relief Joint Association for the Yellow River Disaster</p>
<h3 id="e158">Reply Telegram to Hua County: Unable to Continue Relief <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai charitable organizations筹募Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Joint Association, due to the sluggishness of all industries in Shanghai and the difficulty in raising funds, sent a reply telegram to Magistrate Xie of Hua County yesterday, stating that they were unable to continue relief. The original telegram stated: Magistrate Xie of the Hua County Government, We have received your telegram with great respect. This Association previously regarded your county's Yellow River as a disaster, and the situation was extremely tragic. We immediately borrowed relief funds and sent personnel to personally inspect and distribute them, doing our best to provide mutual assistance. We apologize for our limited capacity and inability to provide universal relief. We are even more ashamed of your constant praise. We admire your love for the people as if they were your children in your request for continued fundraising and thorough relief. However, in Shanghai, all industries have been sluggish in recent years, and financial stagnation has made it extremely difficult to raise relief funds. The previously borrowed funds have not yet been repaid, and we are really unable to continue relief. We hope you will understand. Master Hongsan and others have safely arrived in Shanghai. Thank you for your thoughts and concerns. Special reply,</p>

<p>The health and behavior of the prisoners this year were generally good. There were 194 deaths due to illness (232 in the previous year) and 6 suicides. One person was transferred to the new prison hospital for treatment due to pathological reasons. The new prison hospital started working on November 20, with an average of 746 outpatient visits per day and 222 inpatients.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the new reformatory, qualified teachers were able to take charge of the intellectual, physical, and vocational training of juvenile offenders. This year, 58 juvenile offenders were transferred from the court. Their general behavior and health were good.</p>
<p>The Western Prison on Xiamen Road received 60 male prisoners from the Consular Court, 239 from the Local Court, 1 female prisoner from the Consular Court, 67 from the Local Court, and 3 male juvenile offenders, all from the Local Court. In addition, there were 111 prisoners temporarily detained in two categories. As of the end of the year, there were 62 male prisoners and 5 female prisoners in prison.

<p>On average, among the 2,080 people who were able to work in prisoner handicrafts, 1,597 worked every day, which is 67 percent. The items produced included sandbags, hemp blankets, uniforms, boots, rickshaw donation plates, woodenware, rattan ware, etc. In addition, they also performed repair work for the Public Works Department, as well as printing documents and binding books for the Municipal Council. The new workshop was completed in November, so more prisoners were able to work.</p>
<p>The City Standard Clock</p>
<h3 id="e160">Reasons for Stopping or Being Inaccurate <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau is Changing the Lines</p>
<p>Since the establishment of electric standard clocks in Shanghai South and Zhabei, the citizens have found them very convenient. However, recently, these standard clocks have sometimes stopped or been inaccurate, which is a bit of a drawback. According to inquiries by reporters to the City Public Works Bureau, when these standard clocks were first set up,</p>
<p>due to a lack of funds, all the lines used bare copper wires temporarily borrowed from telephone poles. As a result, whenever there were strong winds and rain or telephone workers repaired telephone lines, the lines were inevitably touched, causing the standard clocks to stop or have differences in speed. The bureau is now trying to change the standard clock lines and will eliminate this problem in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Young Resident of Henan Hostel Commits Suicide by Taking Poison <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>On the evening before last at around 7:00 p.m., a young man named Zhou Zhifang, aged about 20, arrived at the Henan Hostel at No. 3, Lane 426, North Henan Road. He booked room number 12. At around 10:00 a.m. the next morning, the hostel tea servant Jiang Qingxi discovered a sobbing sound in the room, which aroused his suspicion. He immediately opened the door and entered, and saw him lying on the bed, his face pale. He also saw an opium box on the table, and knew that he had taken poison. He immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and ordered detectives to go to investigate. They immediately took him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and he soon died. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Filun Road. Detectives found a suicide note beside the deceased, addressed to his parents, which stated that he was suffering from economic difficulties, which led to the thought of ending his life, etc. However, there was no address on the letter, so it was impossible to deliver it. A wallet was also found, containing only four small dollars and four pawn tickets, as well as a card printed with the words "Xue Guanxing." The detectives then knew that Zhou Zhifang was an alias. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning, Prosecutor Diao Chengtang was dispatched by the First Special District Local Court to examine the body. According to Jiang Qingxi's report of the previous situation:</p>
<p>Prosecutor Diao concluded that the deceased, Xue Guanxing, male, indeed died from taking opium poison during his lifetime. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Heavy Smoker, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a traveler entered the Rongtai Hotel at No. 516 Hua Fa Mingguo Road. The tea boy led him to room 21. He claimed to be Shi Guiyang, 20 years old, from Nanjing, and worked at the World Book Company on Fourth Horse Road. His family lived at No. 1 Xianqing Lane, Laoximen. Recently, due to excessive extravagance, he embezzled more than 300 yuan of his brother's (who opened a bookstore) book accounts and squandered them. However, when the end of the lunar year arrived, his brother discovered it and strictly investigated. Guiyang had no way to turn things around and was at a loss. Therefore, he had no face to see his father and brothers at home, so he temporarily took refuge in an inn, swallowed a large amount of raw opium, and committed suicide behind people's backs. Fortunately, the tea boy discovered it early, and immediately called his father, Gengsheng (at Hua Fang Photo Studio in Ximen), to the scene to help transport him to Renji Hospital. However, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at midnight at 12.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Red Pills Seized and Bribed Release <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yan Chuntang, a well-known seller of red pills in this port, has a factory in Shanghai that manufactures poisonous pills with the trademark "Golden Rooster." He sends partners to Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other areas to sell them, and the sales are quite wide. A few days ago, Inspector Jiang of the Pengjian Town branch of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau intercepted a transport ship in the river at Datong Bridge and seized more than 1,200 catties of Golden Rooster brand red pills, as well as the ship's partners. They learned that they were sold by Yan Chuntang and were being transported to Wuxi for sale. When Yan learned in Shanghai that the red pill ship had been detained, he sent someone to Kunshan overnight to ask the local gangster leader to intercede with Inspector Jiang. As a result, Yan paid 1,300 yuan to redeem the transport ship and the red pills it contained, which continued to sail to Wuxi for sale. After learning about this from a visit by Hua Shijun, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, in addition to widely dispatching detectives to strictly block the various key areas, he also sent a detective team leader to Shanghai a few days ago to conduct a secret investigation. Yesterday, he took a car back to Kunshan, reported the findings of the investigation to Director Hua, and prepared a document to come to Shanghai to transfer the leader Yan Chuntang back to the case for interrogation in order to suppress the toxic atmosphere.</p>

<p>Fan Aisheng Case</p>
<h3 id="e165">Kidnappers Interrogated Yesterday Morning <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>One Kidnapper Used to be an Elementary School Principal</p>
<p>All Criminals Detained and Investigation Continues</p>
<p>Fan Aisheng, a native of Jiangyin, lives at No. 31 Guluo Road in the French Concession. He opened the Dehe Gongqing Company on Ningbo Road. At 7:30 p.m. on the 23rd of last month, Fan took his private car from the company to return home. When passing Guangxi Road near Shantou Road, he was suddenly kidnapped by kidnappers and extorted a huge sum of money. Until yesterday, Chinese Chief Detective You A'gen of the Old Gate Police Station received a report that the kidnappers had contacted Fan's family, at 6:00 p.m., at the intersection of Gansi East Road and West Aishi Road in the French Concession,</p>
<h3 id="e166">To Discuss Ransom <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Matters, he immediately ordered Chinese detectives Zhou Guisen, Zhang Yuanqing, Liu Junqing, Xie Shuiquan, and others to disguise themselves separately and ambush in the vicinity. He also ordered Chinese detective Shen Jinwen to impersonate a representative of Fan's family, holding a piece of preserved meat in one hand and a letter from the kidnappers in the other. Chinese detectives Liu Ziliang, Yan Shiqing, and Bao Detective Wang Yifei hid in a nearby house, ready to act as needed. After the deployment was completed, they set off separately. When Detective Shen arrived at the scene, he saw a person riding a bicycle passing in front of Shen, blowing a whistle in his mouth, and told him to follow him west. Shen ignored him. Then the person came again and told Shen to go south. Shen ignored him again. Before long, another man</p>
<h3 id="e167">Holding a Handgun <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Approached Detective Shen and pointed a gun at him, telling him to follow him. Shen followed him step by step. At that time, detective Liu Ziliang suddenly stepped forward from behind and hugged the bandit's waist. Unexpectedly, the bandit immediately fired a shot at Liu with the gun, hitting his shoulder. The ambushing detectives, seeing the emergency, rushed forward and captured the bandit, snatching a handgun with four bullets inside, and nine bullets were found on his body. He was interrogated and learned that his name was Liu Ziyu, from Shandong. He also confessed that the hostage was hidden at No. 10 Shunan Lane, West Aishi Road. The detectives immediately went there, but</p>
<h3 id="e168">No One Was There <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>They rescued the hostage Fan Aisheng in the pavilion room on the third floor. After searching, they also seized 20 bullets, two house rental receipt stamps, and 85 yuan. Then another person from Jiangbei, Qiu Yulou, was found on the drying platform. After a while, Cui Yaowen (also known as Zi</p>
<p>Ming), a native of Chongming, was found wandering in the lane. His behavior was suspicious and he was caught by the detectives. They were all taken to the police station. It was found that the house where the hostage was hidden was rented by Cui under the alias Li Jinming from the owner. Qiu Yulou also confessed that he was hired by Cui as a servant. The house was also rented by Cui. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where Criminal Judge Qian Hongye interrogated them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation, and said that this case</p>
<h3 id="e169">Still Under Investigation <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The remaining accomplices are being arrested, so please reschedule the hearing. Then Fan Aisheng submitted a petition about the kidnapping situation and pointed out that Liu and Qiu, the two defendants, were at the scene of the kidnapping. After arriving at the bandit's den, four people took turns guarding him day and night. Qiu was one of them. Liu seemed to be the leader of the bandits. The guards were all under his command. Liu also instructed me to write a letter. I told him that I had no property. He said that two relatives, Wu Tongwen, had forced me to write a letter home. I cannot remember whether Cui Yaowen was at the scene. Cui Yaowen's presence on the scene is unknown. Qian</p>
<h3 id="e170">Under Jin's Instruction <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Yulou confessed that he was employed by Li Jinming (referring to Cui Yaowen) and was entirely under Li's command, while Cui Yaowen confessed that I have been the principal of a municipal elementary school for 13 years. Now I am the director of teaching affairs at Qinyie Girls' School on West Aishi Road. The principal of the school can testify. He denied that the house was rented by him and that he participated in the kidnapping. Police lawyer Li said that two keys were found on Cui's body, which were used to open the house where the hostage was hidden. But Cui still sophistically said that the keys were for my room door. After reviewing the confession, Judge Qian ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<p>Imported Bicycles</p>
<h3 id="e171">Japanese Goods Overwhelm British Goods <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Have Forgotten the National Crisis</p>
<p>The Japanese Newspaper Naturally Praises It</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Japanese Newspaper, the popularity of bicycles in China has recently surged. Shanghai, being the foremost commercial and industrial city in China, is witnessing a scramble for bicycles for transporting goods. The reasons for the prevalence of bicycles are threefold: firstly, the speed of bicycles has increased, making them suitable for commercial warfare; secondly, they save labor; thirdly, they eliminate the worry of theft; and fourthly, they are convenient to use. This is a sign of cultural progress among Chinese merchants. Currently, most of the bicycles used are from Japan. Last year's import volume was approximately 570,000 yuan, of which 290,000 yuan came from Japan and 200,000 yuan from Britain. If calculated separately for the months around October last year, July saw 70,000 yuan, with Japan accounting for 31,000 yuan and Britain 30,000 yuan; August saw 45,000 yuan, with Japan 17,000 yuan and Britain 18,000 yuan, and Germany 10,000 yuan; September saw 51,000 yuan, with Japan 18,000 yuan and Britain 24,000 yuan; October saw 58,000 yuan, with Japan 38,000 yuan and Britain 14,000 yuan; November saw 47,000 yuan, with Japan 25,000 yuan and Britain 13,000 yuan; December saw 40,000 yuan, with Japan 23,000 yuan and Britain 12,000 yuan. From the above, it can be seen that Japanese products have overwhelmed British products. The quantity of imported bicycle accessories has also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>The Xinningxing Encountered a Severe Storm</p>
<h3 id="e172">A Wave Pushed it Back 20 Li <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>It Returned Safely to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Xinningxing vessel of the Sanbei Company, on its voyage from Xiamen to Shanghai this time, encountered a severe storm en route. The ship's hull was in extreme danger and nearly capsized. Fortunately, the vessel escaped danger and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is indeed fortunate. It is noted that the Xinningxing vessel was previously dispatched to Fujian and then to Xiamen. On the 25th, the ship departed from Xiamen, heading back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when sailing in the open sea off Xiamen, between 118 degrees 34 minutes East longitude and 24 degrees 13 minutes North latitude, it encountered a severe storm. At that time, around 11 a.m., the captain of the Xinningxing, realizing that a storm had suddenly arisen on the sea and that the ship had no way to avoid it, urgently directed the ship to sail against the wind to avoid a major disaster. However, the wind and waves were too strong. The Xinningxing, running at full speed, could not withstand the onslaught of the storm. A wave surged, and the water even went over the ship's hull. The spray reached the bridge, causing seawater to enter various parts of the ship. At the most critical moment, the ship's hull was even tilted sideways by the huge waves, nearly capsizing. All the crew members and sailors engaged in rescue work, fighting against the fierce wind and waves. The situation was even more perilous at night. At that time, radio communication was also impossible. From noon on the 25th to noon on the 26th, after 24 hours of storm attack, the crew members, working tirelessly amidst the raging waves, without food or sleep, worked together to save the ship. Normally, at least 240 to 250 nautical miles could be traveled in 24 hours, but on that day, only 30 nautical miles were covered in the severe storm, which proves the strength of the wind and the ferocity of the waves. By noon on the 26th, the wind was even stronger, and the waves were even bigger. The Xinningxing was in extreme danger, but it was pushed back 20 nautical miles by the strong wind before finally reaching Huitan Bay. The ship's hull turned from danger to safety. At this time, the captain ordered the ship to anchor there temporarily to avoid the wind and sent a telegram to Shanghai, briefly stating that the Xinningxing had encountered a storm, and the ship's hull was about to capsize. From noon yesterday to noon today, only 30 li had been traveled, but it had been pushed back 20 li by the wind. The situation was extremely dangerous. It was now sheltering from the storm in Huitan Bay and reorganizing the ship's body. After the wind subsided slightly, the ship was able to weigh anchor and head to Shanghai. It was originally planned to dock in Min, but due to the delay caused by the wind and waves, the voyage was delayed. Therefore, it sailed directly to Shanghai. It arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday. The ship is now docked in Pudong. Afterwards, the crew members spoke of the dangers of the great storm and turned pale at the mention of it. However, they returned safely to Shanghai, and the crew members were unharmed, and the hull was also as good as new. It was indeed fortunate. Now, the ship is still planning to be dispatched to Fuzhou in a day or two.</p>
<p>Tai Hengyuan Gold Shop</p>
<h3 id="e173">Robbed in the Early Morning <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Losses Amounted to 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Tai Hengyuan Gold Shop, located at No. 15 Qingyuan Road, Beijing Road, specializes in gold trading. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, while the shop assistants were sorting out market information, six robbers suddenly broke into the shop. They spoke in Northern and local accents and wore long and short gowns of varying colors. Each carried a handgun. Two of the robbers first guarded the front and back doors separately, while the remaining robbers shouted at the shopkeeper and assistants in the store, ordering them to be silent and confining them to a room. After forcing the accountant to hand over the key to the safe, they carried out the confinement. The robbers then looted wantonly, taking all the silver dollars and cash. The total loss amounted to more than 10,000 yuan. After the robbers left, the shop assistants were able to regain their freedom. However, they saw that the store was in a chaotic state and could not be inventoried. They urgently telegraphed the Central Police Station to report the incident. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate. As the robbers had already fled far away, they returned to the police chief to file the case and secretly arrested them in different locations.</p>

He was taken away by kidnappers and hidden in the bandit's den at No. 1 Zhongde Lane, Xiaomuqiao Road, Longhua. A letter was sent demanding a huge ransom. Subsequently, Huatan Inspector Tai Jingfan, detectives Liang Yuliang, Ji Yushan, etc. of the Hui Police Station successively arrested eleven male and female kidnappers, including Zhang Aqing, and rescued the hostage He Boyan. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the time for sentencing arrived.

<p>Suzhou Creek</p>
<h3 id="e176">Navigation Was Cut Off Again Yesterday <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, due to the large number of ships and the falling tide, navigation was cut off again in Suzhou Creek. From Xinda Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, and Xinlaji Bridge, the ships in the river could be seen packed together like ants. Among them were mainly flour boats, rice straw boats, coal boats, plank boats, brick and tile boats, and steamed bun boats. It was not until nightfall that the situation had not been cleared. At present, the water police are trying to order the ships at both ends to withdraw in order to allow navigation.</p>
<p>Saltwater Rushed into Wusong</p>
<p>The Congee Tasted Bad and Was Hard to Swallow</p>
<p>Opium Addicts Were Busy Hiring Porters</p>
<p>The weather a few days ago was unusually cold. After the heavy snow, it turned sunny and warm, as if it were spring. However, in recent days, the tides have receded, causing saltwater to rush into the mouth of the river. The water in the Wusong area has tasted salty since the day before yesterday, and it was even worse yesterday. The taste was quite salty and bitter. Even the congee cooked in people's homes had a salty taste. All the teahouses experienced sluggish business due to the saltwater. However, beverages are essential for life. This salty tea is not only increasingly thirst-quenching but may also damage the throat. The most deeply feared is its use in cooking opium. Once used mistakenly, it cannot be remedied. Therefore, the usual old opium smokers are busy searching for fresh water. However, the porters from Jiangbei are taking advantage of this opportunity, charging 20 to 30 cents or 40 to 50 cents per load of fresh water. This side business is also quite considerable. It is noted that this saltwater rushes into the mouth of the river every year at the end of the year and the beginning of spring, lasting for two or three days for a short period and six or seven days for a longer period. It occurs once or twice every year. The superstitious villagers call it the New Year's tide, which is the common name for saltwater entering the river.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Held a Memorial Service for Martyrs Qian and Shi Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters Sent Cao Gongqun to Preside Over the Ceremony</p>
<p>Encouraging Future Generations to Use Their Spirit as a Model</p>
<p>After the successive deaths of Martyrs Qian Yizhang and Shi Jimei, the municipal party and government agencies held a memorial service at the Youth Propaganda Group at 2 p.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e178">Representatives Present <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Those present included Cao Gongqun from the Central Party Headquarters, Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Lu Jingshi and Lin Kecong from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (represented by Li Ruzhang), and more than 300 representatives from the General Labor Union (Social Bureau, Seamen's Party Headquarters, Seamen's Union, Seamen's Branch, Middle School Joint Wheel Opportunity, Navigation United Righteousness Association, Water Patrol General Team, etc.) from all walks of life. Wen Hongen, Chen Su, and Lu Jingshi served as chairpersons, and Cao Gongqun presided over the ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Ceremony Details <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began and the rituals were performed, Cao Gongqun first reported that today, as a representative of the Central Party Headquarters, he was attending the memorial service for Martyrs Qian and Shi. He felt very sad because, at this time of national crisis, the two martyrs were harmed by reactionaries, causing a great loss to the nation and the country. However, in grief, he hoped that all comrades must embrace the spirit of sacrifice in order to achieve success. The fearless spirit of the two martyrs can serve as a model for future generations. Next, Chen Su and Wen Hongen reported on the biographies of Martyrs Qian and Shi, followed by thanks from the families.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Memorial Oration <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>On the 30th day of January, 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Central Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, the China Seamen's Special Party Headquarters, and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, on behalf of others, respectfully offer clear wine and various dishes to the spirits of Martyr Qian Yizhang and Martyr Shi Jimei. The labor and peasant policy is overly radical and deviates from the mean, flourishing and spreading throughout East Asia. We are neighbors and the first to be infected by its wind. Heresies are rampant, and heterodox theories are debated, noisy and chaotic, seemingly foolish and dazed, harming the country and the people, causing endless harm. Shanghai is a corner where Chinese and foreigners communicate, and all kinds of evils abound. Hidden dangers multiply, like raising venomous snakes. Alas, the two gentlemen, loyal to the country, bravely went forward, becoming pioneers for the people, exposing traitors and uncovering secret traces, fulfilling their missions, striving for the public good, not caring for themselves, and doing their best. They eliminated their leaders and pacified those who were coerced, repeatedly establishing special merits and repeatedly reporting their achievements. The bandits harbored poisonous plans, like vipers and lizards, harboring hatred and resentment, and ambushed them. The two gentlemen unfortunately encountered their attacks. Within two months, they were shot, and their souls returned to the sea, and spring river blood dripped. When the bad news came, it was like a thunderbolt in the clear sky. Tears poured down, and weeping poured down like rain. Alas, the two gentlemen were born as heroes and died with honor. The two gentlemen were born with integrity and intelligence, outstanding among people, and the best among iron. They were excellent in learning and profound in knowledge, ambitious and generous, role models for young people, and pillars of the party and the country. Sacrificing for the country, their courage is commendable, and their loyalty is commendable. Sacrificing themselves for righteousness, their achievements are established, and their names are made. They will be passed down forever, and though dead, they still live. Alas, the dead are gone, and the living should not be sad. The red atmosphere has not cleared, and the Japanese pirates are rampant. The urgent task today is to pacify the inside and resist the outside. Continue the will of the two gentlemen and strive to achieve it. May the spirits rest in peace.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shangchuan Bus Adds Ferry Service <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Operating Between Caojia Road, Gujia Road, Xujia Road, and Huangjiawan</p>
<p>Transportation between Chuansha and Shanghai, with the Shangchuan long-distance bus service, has always been convenient. However, the northern areas, such as Gujia Road, Beicaijia Road, and Huangjiawan, are far from the Puhbin in the west and the bus station in the south. The journey is still long. Usually, transportation relies solely on hand-pushed carts, which are neither economical nor time-saving. Whenever it rains, the roads are slippery and difficult to travel, making the journey even more difficult for travelers. Now, in order to develop transportation convenience for passengers in that area, the company has decided to add a small motorboat from February 1st, operating from Huangjiawan, passing through Xujia Road, Beicaijia Road, Gujia Road, to Caojia Road Station, running back and forth, picking up and dropping off passengers. The one-way boat fare is uniformly eight cents. Passengers who also take the bus will only be charged four cents for the boat fare in addition to the bus ticket. After this line is implemented, passengers in that area will have more convenient transportation, which will surely increase the number of passengers. The departure times are attached below: Huangjiawan departs at 7:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3:00 p.m. Caojia Road departs at 8:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 4:30 p.m., four trips each. The wharves along the way include Huangjiawan, North Xujia Road South City, (Lukoujiugou), North Caijia Road North City, (Zhaojiagou), Gujia Road, (Hui North School East), Caojia Road (West Side of the Electric Light Factory), etc., five locations.</p>
<p>North China Textile Factory</p>
<h3 id="e182">Sells Products to Raise Funds to Help Women and Children <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The products of the Tianjin North China Textile Factory cannot be sold in the Northeast due to the impact of Japanese dumping. In addition, cotton yarn prices have plummeted, resulting in cost losses, and accumulated inventory, forming a stranded situation. The factory was originally established during the May 3rd Massacre, when public-spirited people in Shandong Province donated large sums of money to help women and children affected by the disaster. At this time of difficult living conditions, if the factory were to close down and cause further displacement, it would be a cause for concern for social security. Therefore, the factory is selling its products to raise funds in order to reverse the declining trend. Well-known figures in the Shanghai business community received the factory's fundraising appeal yesterday. The original text stated: Since the May 3rd Massacre, compatriots in Shandong Province have risen up to boycott enemy goods and generously donated funds to establish industries. Our factory was established in response to the situation, mainly engaged in dyeing, weaving, and sewing. In the early stages of its establishment, the results were not good, and losses were exhausted. In recent years, we have carefully studied and developed, and our industry has become increasingly advanced. Our products surpass those from abroad in quality, and our scale is fully prepared. Our sales have spread throughout the Northeast provinces. We were expecting to develop, but we have been affected by the Japanese invaders. Our goods cannot be sold in the Northeast provinces, cotton yarn prices have plummeted, resulting in cost losses, and accumulated inventory, forming a stranded situation, making it almost impossible to maintain. However, in recent years, hundreds of women and children affected by disasters have been sent to the factory by public and private organizations to learn industry. They are about to become unemployed and cannot be accommodated. After a public meeting, it was said that at this time of difficult living conditions, society cannot afford to add a large number of unemployed vagrants. Moreover, after several years of operation, the results have been remarkable. Due to the impact of the current situation, the economy is temporarily unable to operate smoothly, resulting in a failure. It is indeed a pity. Rather than closing down and going bankrupt, why not sell products to raise funds? Everyone agreed, so we specially sell products to raise funds, hoping to collect contributions from all sides, and repeatedly ask for introductions in various ways, hoping that Your Excellency's benevolent reputation will spread far and wide, and your high friendship is worthy of admiration. We dare to humbly present several kinds of products, hoping that you will generously donate funds to help us through this difficult time. Not only will our factory be able to maintain our livelihood, but hundreds of poor women and children workers who have no home to return to will not be displaced and will be able to survive, all thanks to the benevolence of Your Excellency. The price of this fundraising is preferably as much as possible, and a small amount is also acceptable. If there are difficulties, you can also return them for other purposes. In recent years, people with lofty ideals have strongly advocated saving the country through industry. You should not be indifferent to our factory's efforts to benefit society and restore our rights. Looking forward to your kind support, we are immensely grateful. We respectfully wish you happiness and attach a list of proposed donation amounts on the left, which can be recognized at will: Support Amount: 100 yuan, Danger Amount: 80 yuan, Stability Amount: 65 yuan, Collapse Amount: 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai East Tea and Water Industry Agreed on Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Business Will Be Suspended for Half a Day Today</p>
<p>About one hundred and dozens of business owners who operate tea houses and water stoves (commonly known as tiger stoves) in the Yangshupu Lan Road Maohai Road Huade Road area of this city. Recently, due to the high price of coal and large expenses, and the Shanghai Waterworks Company has changed the water contract system (usually the water fee for each household is 6 to 12 yuan per month) to water meter calculation, the monthly water fee has increased to three or four times the amount, which will lead to an inability to maintain the state. A meeting of the industry was convened some days ago to discuss relief measures. As a result, it was agreed to organize the Shanghai East Tea and Water Industry Friendship Association. Shi Dehua, Zhang Zuoxian, Xue Jinzhu, Chen Hongshun, Zhao Jinbiao, Xu De, Xu Mingdong, Huang Dafang, Sheng Kaixian, and other nine people were elected as directors. It was also agreed on industry regulations and other matters. The most important thing is to stop business for half a day starting at 2 pm today (31st). From tomorrow (February 1st), hot water will be uniformly 10 cents for two spoons, each spoon weighing one market catty, in order to avoid unnecessary competition among the industry and maintain business. The water spoon used will be purchased and issued by the association. The overpass next to Tongxing Building on the west end of Taopeng Road, Pingjia Road, was selected as the temporary office. It is also heard that regarding the water fee issue, Attorney Shen Xiaoxiang has been entrusted to ask the waterworks company to maintain the original water contract method.</p>
<p>Hangjiang Road Reduced Freight Rates for Maolu Paper</p>
<p>The Two Roads Still Charge According to the Original Grade</p>
<p>The two roads car department yesterday issued a circular to all stations, saying, "In the case of paper transportation, the method of charging fees according to the three grades of excellent, ordinary, and coarse was notified in the circular No. 2391.12846 on November 14, 22nd year, and ordered to be followed. Now, the Hangjiang Road Transportation Department's letter opened, 'Check the item of Maolu paper, which is a local product of Longyou Yushan on this road. The material is not very good. According to the copy of the letter No. 2391.12846 sent by your office, the fee is charged according to the second-class cargo, which is rather high. Now, in order to promote domestic production and develop industry, it has been approved by the Engineering Bureau to change the fee to the fourth-class cargo. In the future, when the paper is handled for intermodal transport, the freight that should be collected by this road should be checked and collected according to the fourth-class cargo. The corresponding letter should be reached, and please check and order to comply with the letter,' etc., are hereby approved. In the future, at each station, in various paper goods, without the express provisions of the Ministry of Railways, the two roads and the Hangjiang Road intermodal transport will be distinguished, and the Mao deer paper will still be handled according to the original grade in the two roads section. In the case of intermodal transport with the Hangjiang Road, the fee will be charged according to the fourth-class cargo on that road section. It is necessary to follow the order."</p>

<p>Alimony for Separation Embezzled by Intermediaries</p>
<p>Feeling Desolate, She Chooses Death</p>
<p>Jiang Lanzhen, a woman from Changzhou, is twenty-nine years old this year. She was formerly married as a concubine to Jiao Wenbin from Zhenjiang (currently forty-one years old, residing at No. 33 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, recently suffering from mental illness and unemployed at home). They lived together at No. 13, Dakangfang, Lane 297, Route Cardinal Foch of the French Concession, as the second landlord. She had no children of her own with Jiao, but they adopted four children: the eldest daughter, Yuying, is seventeen years old this year, the second daughter is twelve years old, the youngest daughter is six years old, and the son is eight years old. Recently, due to Jiao's sudden mental illness, the relationship between husband and concubine deteriorated, making it impossible to live in peace. Therefore, around the summer of this year according to the old lunar calendar, through the mediation of mutual friends and relatives, she separated from Jiao, remaining in the original residence. Jiao was to pay her alimony of 1,500 yuan, but most of this amount was consumed by intermediaries, and Jiang actually received only several hundred yuan. Over the past eight or nine months, she had spent almost all of it, and suddenly felt economically distressed. Supporting one son and three daughters, she felt that her life was drifting, without support or reliance, and feeling desolate, she conceived a desperate thought. Therefore, the night before last, while the children and other tenants were sound asleep, at dusk when it was quiet, she took off her trouser belt, hung herself. It was not until eight o'clock yesterday morning that her eldest daughter, Yuying, sleeping upstairs, got up and entered the room, calling for her mother without response, and discovered that she had hanged herself on the side of the bed. She quickly called the neighbors to rescue her, but it was too late. She had already died of suffocation, her body stiff. They immediately notified the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate, and at the same time, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary, waiting for the Second Special District Court to send personnel to examine it today.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, a man, Mr. A, aged approximately fifty, went to the floating bridge of the Taikoo Wharf on the Xinkaihe side of the Bund in the French Concession to defecate. By chance, he was careless and lost his footing, causing him to fall into the river with a splash. He quickly sank to the bottom of the river.

He was taken to the police station and yesterday sent to the Criminal Division One of the Second Special District Court. Acting Judge Qiu Huan-ying took the stand for interrogation. The police lawyer Chen Ming explained the case and prosecuted him according to Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law, and submitted the evidence. Zhang confessed to the sale without denying it. The court verified the confession and sentenced Zhang Huisheng on the spot for intending to sell and possessing opium substitutes, to eight months of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan, which could be converted into imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention, or two yuan of fine for one day of detention.

<p>Six or Seven Bandits Injured the Victim's Right Eye</p>
<p>Police Officers Heard the Alarm and Rounded Up, Capturing One Thief on the Spot</p>
<p>A rickshaw owner named Xu Xiaobo, who makes a living by renting out rickshaws, lives at No. 10, Junyi Lane, Dapuqiao Road, Shanghai. Xu, coming from humble origins, knows the hardship of resources, so he is diligent and thrifty. Over the years, he has accumulated some savings, but unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. Yesterday morning at approximately 12:10 AM, six or seven bandits suddenly came, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, each holding sharp weapons and pistols. They threatened Xu to keep silent and demanded that he hand over money and valuables. Xu resisted slightly, and one bandit immediately injured Xu's right eye and kept watch over him. The other five bandits then scattered to plunder, which lasted about half an hour, before each carrying their loot and fleeing. After the incident, a detailed investigation of the losses revealed that in addition to cash, silver dollars, and copper coins totaling about one hundred yuan, along with gold jewelry and clothing, the total was about two hundred and fifty yuan. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment, the Second District United Office had already received the news. The patrol officer Zhang Fude of the Rihuiqiao substation led a large number of police officers to round up from all sides, chasing directly to the intersection of Xietu Road and Dapu Road, intercepting one thief, seizing a six-inch pistol with the serial number 96883, and nine bullets, and taking him to the district for strict interrogation. According to the confession, his name is Xu Laoer, thirty-four years old, from Zhenjiang, living on a boat in Caojiadu. He had accomplices Wang Jinshan and Zhou Jinbao, and had invited three strangers to conspire to rob. After the confession, District Chief Li immediately prepared a document to submit to the Third Section for interrogation, and at the same time ordered his subordinates to strictly arrest the accomplices and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Go master Gu Shui-ru and calligrapher Ren Cixiang have recently returned from the north and are staying at the residence of the owner of Yin Lu. Yesterday, a banquet was specially held to welcome the two gentlemen. More than ten people including the famous doctor Tao Muzhang were present. Mr. Gu's chess skills have long been famous at home and abroad. This time when coming to Shanghai, he will definitely play against famous people in Shanghai such as Liu Dihuai, Zhang, Wang Zixian and other gentlemen. Mr. Ren has been studying calligraphy for many years. During the banquet, the owner asked for calligraphy to keep as a souvenir. Mr. Ren generously wrote a couplet saying (Moving strange rocks to deceive thin monks, not crushing flower bushes for many guests). His writing is like holding an egg, and his movement of the brush is like a hanging needle. When the tip of the brush touches the paper, where it is moist, ink lines rise, and where it is dry, thousands of hairs exert force together. His structure is like seal script entering running script, and also like eight parts entering cursive script, simple and vigorous, truly the style of the Qin and Han dynasties. All the gentlemen present added their praises, believing that since the passing of Gao Yongzhi, Wu Changshuo, Qing Daoren, Zeng Nongran and other artists in Shanghai, the art world has long felt desolate. Today, Ren Zi has stopped in Shanghai and is happy to form a calligraphy connection with scholars who know calligraphy on the sea. Those who want to obtain Mr. Ren's calligraphy treasures can ask Chen Changyi of Jiangzhe Bank and Cai Shenfu of the Shen Bao Editorial Department for the price list.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Fundamental Problems of Reading (Part 3) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>(3) The Path of Self-Study</p>
<p>Yesterday I spoke from the perspective of the purpose of reading, and now I will talk about the methods of reading.</p>
<p>The method of reading is the steps that a beginner should take. We now divide it into five stages. Most of our readers are dropouts, and their foundation in writing is not very solid. Therefore, we believe that the first step in reading is to make the reader's tool, that is, writing, fluent. We know that reading must be able to understand the words; if you can't understand the words in the book, how can you understand the content of the book? But now, many readers are making this mistake. They often write many bad comments on the books they return to our library, saying how obscure the writing is, or how stiff the translation is. Of course, many books are indeed like this, but after we have carefully read many books (because of the readers' suggestions), we feel that the writing is not very bad or difficult to understand, and these books are mostly literary books, without specialized terms and the need for considerable knowledge to understand. Therefore, we have to say that this is because the reader's writing skills are not enough and the reading is not serious. Therefore, we hope that readers with weak literary foundations will pay more attention to this, because this is a prerequisite for reading. However, learning to write, except for those who want to study linguistics, is just a tool. It is enough for us to learn to understand modern Chinese and write clear articles. However, we should not spend a lot of time on writing, because our country's science is backward, and many people advocate that readers must read foreign languages. We cannot fully agree with this point. The reasons have been seen in several questions about choosing subjects (see this column on January 13th and 14th). Readers should be able to review and will not repeat them.</p>
<p>The above is the first stage of reading. The work in this stage can be carried out simultaneously with the preparation stage mentioned above, or completed before. After the above two steps are completed, the choice of subjects has been decided, and the tools for reading can also be said to be in order, so you can start to study the subject you have chosen. At the beginning, we advocate reading a book of this subject "Introduction" "Outline" and the like, must be the contents of the subject, the basic concepts in mind. At this stage, reading is not about "more", but about "precision". Because in the early stages of learning, the most feared thing is not being able to get a systematic concept, but being filled with a stomach of fragmented and chaotic knowledge. Therefore, "intensive reading" (Intensive Work) is the only principle that beginners must follow. When the editor was reading in the early years of university, because of his high desire for knowledge, he liked to read many books quickly, but as a result, not only did his knowledge not become richer, but it also made the basic concepts of the subjects he studied unclear. This is the painful experience of the editor. Now it is too late to regret it, and I hope that those who are determined to read will not repeat my "mistakes". If the reader already has a rough understanding of the basic knowledge, then the next reading work is not to read many specialized works, not to study various theories, not to study the development history of the subject, not to do research on certain small problems... but to study "the methodology of learning". Now, because the whole society is in an era of great upheaval, various theories are emerging. We are seeking the truth in these chaotic theories. It is really not an easy task, but it is also not a difficult task. Because the differences in theories are mostly due to the different points of view and "the different methodologies adopted". If we can lay a solid foundation for "the methodology of learning", I think there will be no such thing as being "entangled by various theories". Therefore, we believe that the central work of the third stage is best to study the methodology of learning. However, it is not possible to have only methods and no materials, so the work of the fourth stage of reading is "extensive reading" (Extensive Work). The so-called "extensive reading" is to broaden your knowledge and expand your scope of knowledge. Because once the scope of knowledge is wide, you will not fall into "ignorance" and will not be blinded by a certain theory. (Readers can refer to this column on January 10th, "The Divergence of Theories and the Grasp of Correct Theories"). In this stage of "extensive reading". At the same time, readers should also extend to many subjects that are related to the subject they are studying. For example, those who study "Economics" should not only have read many famous economic works, specialized economic problems, and books on economic history, but also need to study other subjects, such as psychology, statistics, and political science. Because the entire activity of human beings cannot be divided into economic, political... but in science, for the convenience of research, it can be divided into many categories of subject names. Moreover, there are many tool subjects for academic research, such as writing and statistics. Therefore, in order to make the subjects we study profound, other auxiliary and related subjects must be read as well. The self-study process has been described in general. However, there are several points to pay attention to when self-studying according to this process, which are mentioned here by the way: (1) The selection of books must be strict, because reading books that distort the facts is worse than not reading books. This condition should be paid special attention to when doing "preparation" and "intensive reading" work. (2) Reading books should be economical. There are really many books now, and it is impossible for one person to read all the books. However, readers should not be angry, because there are many books that are really unnecessary to read. Therefore, when reading a certain book, readers must consider whether reading it is more beneficial than reading other books, and whether it is economical in terms of time and energy. (3) When "extensively reading" and "studying other auxiliary subjects", you should compare their importance, and you should think in your heart: Is "extensive reading" more important, or is "studying other auxiliary subjects" more important?</p>
<p>(4) Do not hinder the "purposeful learning" for the sake of learning "means". For example, if learning "statistics" is for the sake of studying "economics", then you must not spend endless time learning "statistics" and put "economics" aside. There are more than a few points that should be paid attention to in self-study, and even these few points still need to be discussed in detail. However, this letter has been written very long, so the unfinished words have to be left for discussion when necessary in the future, ｜Kang｜</p>

<h3 id="e211">Death <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>Death, what a dark, miserable, and decadent word! If you say that someone has died, how sad you are for him, and at the same time, there is a sense of reality that makes you feel that everything is empty. Or someone and you enter! "I'm going to die!" How shocked and surprised you are, you must try your best to stop him from this attempt. Therefore, death is the enemy of all living things. People certainly curse it, and no other animals are willing to avoid it. But there is a stubborn devil!! Death, for everything is never compromised, never tolerant, so the tragedy of mankind is doomed. So the stage of life often has a touching performance. Regardless of wealth or poverty, the advent of death is unstoppable, and at the same time, everyone will inevitably encounter this ending. The greatness and power of death can be seen from here. It does not have the snobbery, flattery, and inequality of the present society. Regardless of intelligence, foolishness, worthiness, or unworthiness, its treatment is the same. However, in my observation, it may be a little more abusive to the rich, which is very obvious in medical treatment. Because the rich have a lot of money, when they are sick, dozens of doctors come to their door every day. Not to mention that the patient's spirit is disturbed, but also that many bitter medicines increase the patient's pain. This is not my nonsense, there are many examples. Recently, there was a rich man whose six-year-old grandson was sick for more than 20 days, and the medical expenses cost more than 20,000 yuan, but in the end, he was taken away by the god of death. Although the children of the poor do not have the pain of excessive medical treatment, they often have to die. The god of death cannot but be said to be very fair in this regard. However, the word death is ultimately the most terrifying noun in the world. Now that science is advocated, there is still no way to deal with death. No matter how advanced science is, it is ultimately no match for the ferocity of the god of death, so people often understand each other under the threat of death. In fact, you will fight for the world in this life, and when the god of death comes, you will still have nothing. There are also people who do not die, that is, when he was alive, he created a lot of happiness for human society. Although his body is dead, his spirit still exists in the world. Only this kind of person is immortal. After all, there are very few immortal people. However, this immortal life is indeed needed by society, so I hope that human beings will not die!</p>

<p>"Not funny is not funny, crying is real crying"</p>
<p>When the boss sees the employee, the employee sees the laborer, a burst of smile must suddenly emerge on everyone's face. The laborer sees the employee, in order to please him, he smiles first. The employee sees the laborer, helplessly retracts his shoulders, and opens the corners of his mouth, barely making out what seems to be a smile. In this exchange of smiles, there is only cold air, not the joy of a son seeing his father, or the smile of a sister hugging her younger brother, but just showing each other's hideous faces. The boss sees the customer, the customer sees the boss, they nod, smile, and sit down to talk about business. The business is over, the customer leaves, and they smile at each other again. The first smile is relatively hopeful, and the smile is more forceful. The latter smile has no strength left, just a cold sinking. The procuress holds the hand of the patron, long sentence, short sentence, constantly giggling, the patron is smiled upon, and then goes to see the prostitute's even deeper flattery smile, the smile is smiled, and the smile covers the world with a black curtain. Not only that, unnatural smiles can be seen everywhere in the world, within a square foot, including the ferociousness of wild beasts and the flattery of foxes.</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>I feel a lack of knowledge, and I often want to buy some books to read. A new book is published, and it always costs several yuan, which makes the poor scholar look away. Sometimes I spend some money and buy a big bag of books back, and my children laugh at me for being old and confused, but my old wife mutters, "What's the use of buying these things? They can't keep you warm in the cold, and they can't feed you when you're hungry!" I also try to defend myself: "First, it's good for me to pass the time; second, I can pass it on to my children." My wife laughs and says: "I've only heard of not knowing people, it's not good to eat; but I haven't heard of not knowing words and starving to death!" I have no sufficient reason to refute. However, loving books is my hobby. To be economical, I can only go to the old book stall to search. Speaking of the old book stall, it used to be gathered in the City God Temple. If you have sharp eyes and pay a cheap price, you can buy some good copies. However, since many sophisticated students specialize in buying old textbooks in old bookstores, I bought these four books back, and after reading them, I couldn't help but have some small feelings: people in the past liked to copy books, but people today are unwilling to do such stupid things. People in the past liked to criticize and circle points in books, but people today are unwilling to dirty the books. After all, people today are smarter than people in the past, so they are unwilling to do so. I think in a few years, handwritten copies may be completely extinct.</p>

<p>— Li Junsi</p>
<p>After a miserable cold rain, the climate obviously turned cold suddenly, especially in the evening. The wind on the street lifted the corners of the robes, and scraped against the body, involuntarily shivering several times. I deeply felt that the cotton robe that was daunting in summer was lovely, and I also felt slightly thinner. In the lights all over the street, women's necks seemed to be shortened by a section, deeply buried in the fur collar of their coats. Men also seemed to have incurable carbuncles growing on their necks, wearing scarves, or even turning up the high collars of their coats. Even if they didn't, everyone subconsciously held their hands, shrunk their necks, and prevented the invasion of the cold wind. Only the rickshaw pullers and the like were still facing the cold wind, panting hot air, pulling dignified people, and striding forward, as if they were born without feeling and did not know cold and heat. Along with the cold wind, the urgent and sharp sound of selling evening newspapers filled the streets and alleys, making people suddenly realize the sorrow of life. Walking past the door of a pawnshop, looking inside, I saw several haggard people standing outside the dense iron fence and the high counter under the bright lights, wondering whether they were mortgaging clothes or redeeming clothes. In the end, was it for clothes? Or was it for food? However, whether it was mortgaging or redeeming, they were all equally pitiful! The mood of dusk became more and more lonely and bleak. Only the radios of several department stores were singing various farcical songs to cater to low-level tastes, "It's also the sound squeezed out of life!" I thought.</p>

<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>The pain is unbearable, listen intently to the drums and music</p>
<p>The joy has not been fulfilled, hasten to bid farewell to the flying talisman</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang silently went over and wrung out a towel, handing it to Guizhi with both hands. Guizhi smiled in a low voice and said: I can't afford this. You're welcome, I'll wash it. He had already changed his clothes. At this time, he rolled up his two small sleeves high, revealing two white and round arms. He took the towel and stood by the dressing table to wash his hands and face. Zhao Ziqiang stood behind him, watching for a while with a slight smile, and then took out the scented soap, snow cream, face powder, and rouge cream from the dressing table drawer, one by one, and placed them on the table. Guizhi smiled and said to him: My husband, how do you understand these? Let me do it myself. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: You're tired today, I have to serve you. Guizhi looked at the door of the room, and seeing that the curtain was down, he said: You're tired too, shouldn't I serve you? Ziqiang smiled and said: I can't afford it. But if you really want to serve me... Guizhi. Reached out and grabbed his mouth and said: That's enough, don't say any more. Ziqiang took the opportunity to hold his hand and sniffed it for a while. Because he heard Zhao Weng's cough in the outer room, he quietly walked away. But he didn't want to walk away either. He walked to the bed and saw the snow-white bedspread and a bed of light blue and pink silk quilt. He felt that the colors were particularly harmonious. The four white pillowcases embroidered with small red flowers were also particularly attractive. So he leaned on the bed with his pillows, sighed slightly, and smiled: I really can't avoid being short of heroic spirit and long on children's affection. Guizhi was still washing his face, not making a sound. Zhao Ziqiang then pulled a pillow and hugged it in his arms, constantly smelling it with his nose on the pillow. Guizhi said: What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: You just said that this is the only thing in your life. The days after the wedding are called honeymoon, don't you know? (234) . So their gaze was focused on Western books and various textbooks. They also changed their name to old bookstore. North Sichuan Road, Cade Road, and Ximen all have them. The price of books is really not cheap. I once bought a "Collection of European and American Short Essays," and it was a pirated version. The original price was three and a half yuan, and it was sold for two and a half yuan. I also went to buy an "Outline of Political Science." This book has been published for a long time, and it is out of date. The original price was one and a half yuan, and it was sold for one yuan. Now, the old bookstore mainly deals in Western books, so it does not pay attention to Chinese ancient books. If you want to buy this kind of book in an old bookstore, it is really difficult to find. Even if there is, the price is also very considerable! Last Sunday, I happened to walk to the Old West Gate. After flipping through it for a while at the old book stall on the roadside, I found several handwritten copies: one is "The Collection of Ouyang Wenzhonggong," the handwriting is very neat, and the cinnabar circle points are almost everywhere. One is "Du Zimei's Poetry Selection," the handwriting is not good, but there are comments. It is "Selected Essays of the Five Dynasties," the handwriting is good, and the selection is also precise. There is also an essay signed with the name "Gu Lin." I actually know what generation and where this old gentleman is from? These four books must be unpopular goods, and no one cares about them, so he sold them to me for eight cents.</p>

<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>Cheng Yuan was, as usual, wearing a camel hair robe with several buttons missing, and a dark green Zhigong呢 vest, with his round head bowed, eating his usual dinner with relish.｜A bowl of Luozhe (diced meat) noodles. "Little Li, be careful, there's water in that orange! Don't get your leather cloak dirty"｜Wu Baojun warned Li Yun with a pitying tone. Indeed, Li Yun was really dressed too carefully. Standing in the middle of these furniture and these two early guests, he was really like a phoenix. "Old Wu, it's New Year's Eve today, how do you have time to come here to chat?" Li Yun knew that Cheng Yuan was a famous poor boy. He incubated in this Longhu magazine almost all day, and sometimes slept on those piles of old magazines. So Li Yun didn't pay attention to him: but he thought that Wu Baojun's appearance in the seat was very strange. Because on ordinary days when the newspaper doesn't stop publishing, Old Wu is still frolicking and has no time. What's more, there is no newspaper as usual on this New Year's Eve. Why did he turn the cart before the horse and tidy up? "Haha! You are living too comfortably! Precisely because today is New Year's Eve, I came here" ! Saying that, Old Wu had already taken out a stack of invoices that were an inch thick from his tattered coat pocket, and waved it at Li Yun. Only then did Li Yun understand. "Poor fellow" ! Li Yun secretly laughed at him. Because although he himself usually lived an absurd and extravagant life like Wu Baojun, because of his environment, he had never tasted the bitterness of being surrounded by bill collectors on New Year's Eve. At that time, Cheng Yuan had already finished eating all the Luozhe noodles, including the soup, and was counting more than a dozen copper coins that had been smoothed. "A'Er, please fill up three copper coins for me, I'll pay you back tomorrow" ! He waved his hand to the waiter with a sallow face, half like a request, half like an order. "It's seven in total, including the day before yesterday" ! A'Er reluctantly took away the bowl and chopsticks, and reluctantly accepted Cheng Yuan's request. Li Yun looked at him and smiled slightly, and then threw a duck gizzard to him. (2) Three years ago New Year's Eve has arrived again. The New Year's Eve mentioned here is still the thirtieth night of the twelfth lunar month, because although the revolution was successful, the old habits of the Chinese people who cherish the old days are still unable to be changed. At about twelve o'clock, two steel-wire rickshaws were rolling westward on N Road, which was, as usual, crowded with people. "Old Cheng, I'm sorry! I've broken your money tonight" ! Li Yun, still wearing a suit and a velvet hat, looked back from the rickshaw in front and apologized to Cheng Yuan in the car behind. Tonight, Cheng Yuan hosted a dinner, inviting Li Yun to go to Kuaihuolin to eat Western food. After dinner, everyone originally planned to go to see a movie again, but because there was no money left in Li Yun's wallet, only ten or so invoices that could barely be pieced together were paid. So the result was that Cheng Yuan was the host again. Cheng Yuan is no longer writing articles, and is working as an assistant to a great lawyer.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Stops Running</p>
<h3 id="e219">Order Regarding Night Classes at Five Shanghai Colleges <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Night Classes Should Be Changed to Supplementary in Nature</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th) The Ministry of Education has ordered the Shanghai private Soochow and Shanghai Baptist Universities, the National Shanghai College of Commerce, and the private Chih Tze College of Law and Political Science to abolish their night classes. The original order stated roughly that, according to reports from inspectors of the Ministry, all the colleges and universities running night classes are in the fields of law and commerce. The classes are generally held from 4:30 PM to 11:00 PM, with four or five classes. The majority of the students have jobs during the day. It has been found that students who work during the day and attend classes at night do not have enough time for self-study outside of class for subjects that require it, and they have no time to rest from morning to night, which affects their energy. On the school side, the prescribed curriculum, apart from indoor lectures, cannot implement military training, physical education, and extracurricular activities. Students each have their own jobs and cannot be restricted to living on campus, making it impossible to strictly implement educational management. Among these students with jobs, there are indeed some who come to study because they feel they lack knowledge, but there are also those who are simply registering for a diploma. Since these night classes are not in line with the regulations of school education and the drawbacks are too numerous to mention, the Ministry specifically orders that these colleges and universities must not recruit new night class students or transfer students from the date of this document. The colleges and universities should formulate their own methods to conclude the studies of current students, and submit a detailed list of the names of the night class students to the Ministry for record, and they must not be reported together with the undergraduate students. If members of society truly have a need to seek specialized knowledge outside of their daytime work, they should only set up night classes of a supplementary nature, and should not overcharge tuition. Each evening class should not exceed three hours. Upon completion of the supplementary courses, a certificate of completion should be issued, and they should not be treated the same as students in formal schools. It is hereby ordered that you comply with these instructions and report back for verification.</p>

<p>｜Report by Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, Li Ximou｜</p>
<p>5. Situation of Local Education Funding and</p>
<p>Suggestions for Rectification</p>
<p>The local education funding in Jiangxi Province has suffered losses over the years due to banditry, and annual revenue has decreased. It is extremely difficult to collect statistics on education in the bandit-affected areas. According to the report from the Department of Education, the total local education funding for the province in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) was only over 730,000 yuan. The statistics on the sources and expenditures of local education funding in each county of Jiangxi Province in the 20th year of the Republic are attached below. (A) "Statistics on the Sources of Education Funding in Each County of Jiangxi Province": The sources of education funding in the 52 counties of Jiangxi Province are divided into five categories: (1) Land tax surcharges totaling 403,889 yuan; (2) Income from school properties, 184,608 yuan; (3) Additional and special levies, 84,286 yuan; (4) Other income, 66,112 yuan, totaling 738,895 yuan. (B) "Statistics on the Expenditures of Education Funding in Each County of Jiangxi Province": The expenditures of education funding in the 52 counties of Jiangxi Province are divided into four categories: (1) Total educational administrative expenses, 135,290 yuan; (2) School education expenses, 543,146 yuan; (3) Social education expenses, 48,388 yuan; (4) Temporary and miscellaneous expenses, 42,791 yuan, totaling 769,615 yuan. The Department of Education of Jiangxi Province has the following opinions regarding the rectification and planning of local education funding: (A) Regarding rectification: (1) "Investigate Educational Properties": Forms were created and repeatedly ordered to be filled out and reported by each county, and provincial school supervisors were instructed to strictly assess the situation during their inspections of education in each county. The counties have now successively filled out the forms and sent them to the Department, which will compile the statistics once they are all received. (2) "Review Education Funding Budgets": The budget for the income and expenditure of education funding for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) in each county, except for bandit areas, have mostly been sent to the Department for review and have been approved or rejected accordingly. At the same time, the Department of Finance also sends personnel to participate when reviewing local funding budgets. In addition, the Department has stipulated standards for education administrative expenses, divided into three grades (Grade A bureau chiefs receive 80 yuan per month, Grade B 70 yuan, and Grade C 60 yuan), which are listed in a separate table with explanations. (3) "Strictly Prohibit the Misappropriation of Education Funding": In accordance with the measures to guarantee local education funding, each county has been notified to comply. Cases of misappropriation that have already occurred, such as the Chongren County government's plan to misappropriate education funds for military use and the Pingxiang County security group's collection of donations from school properties, were immediately stopped by telegram. (4) "Draft Regulations for Education Funding Audit Committees in Each County of Jiangxi Province": These regulations were drafted in accordance with Article 14 of the central government's measures to guarantee education funding and have been sent to each county for compliance in organization. (5) "Propose that the Financial Committees of Each County Manage Education Funding": It is proposed to follow the supplementary measures promulgated by the Ministry for the financial bureaus of each county to manage education funding. This has been approved for adoption by this headquarters. (B) Regarding planning: (1) Plan to pilot the method of raising funds for compulsory education in the relatively stable county areas of this province (Explanation): The local education funding in each county of this province has always been managed by the Education Bureau or the County Education Funding Management Committee. Since the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression issued the regulations for rectifying local finances in each county in the bandit suppression area, the original Management Committee has been taken over by the Financial Committee. Therefore, the Department can only start with investigation and review in terms of rectification, and the principle of the guarantee measures is to prohibit misappropriation." Furthermore, the education funding in each county, apart from the original properties (rental income from houses, shops, and school fields), relies solely on a portion of the land tax surcharge (7/15ths). Bandit areas have no collection at all, and counties near bandit areas have also suffered sharp declines in income. Therefore, the education funding in each county is at most tens of thousands of yuan, and at least only four or five thousand yuan. This is the general situation of local education funding in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>6. Situation of Implementing Compulsory Education and Promoting People's Schools, and Opinions of Responsible Persons</p>
<p>The situation of promoting compulsory education in Jiangxi Province is similar to that in Anhui Province, and the difficulties are also similar. Therefore, the Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the First Phase and the Outline of Measures for Implementing Short-Term Compulsory Education, both set by the Ministry, have not been actively implemented. Recently, Director Cheng of the Department of Education inspected northern Jiangxi and vigorously promoted short-term elementary schools. In Jiujiang, he jointly discussed methods with local gentry and scholars. Each school requires about 80 yuan of funding per term. Over a hundred schools were immediately recognized by various groups, and about 40 schools have already been established. Regarding the fundraising for compulsory education, the Department of Education has drafted ten principles and four methods, which are recorded below: (1) Take a village or a group of connected villages as a unit. (2) The number of classes needed for all school-age children in a group should be the number of classes to be set up (each class is calculated to accommodate 50 children). (3) The total cost of the classes to be set up in a group should be the amount of funding to be raised by that group (each class is calculated at 300 yuan per year). (4) The people in a group who are able to produce should bear the aforementioned expenses according to their financial strength (the burden per person should not exceed 5% of annual income). However, if there are public properties and rental income that can be allocated within a village or connected villages, they should be allocated as much as possible." There is no overall plan for the establishment and promotion of people's schools. However, in the Department of Education's Plan for Improving Education in this Province in the 22nd Year of the Republic (1933), there are several articles on the improvement direction: (1) Make full use of existing educational institutions to run people's schools, with existing teachers and senior students (limited to secondary schools and above) responsible for teaching. (2) To popularize literacy education, it should first be carried out in districts of the provincial capital and gradually promoted to each county, with the goal of implementation in all villages with more than 100 households within five years. The province currently has a small number of people's schools, and the promotion of literacy movements often fails to arouse students' interest or seek improvements in methods, so the results are not very significant.</p>
<p>7. Current Situation of Secondary Education for Girls and Promotion Measures</p>
<p>There are a total of ten public and private secondary schools for girls in Jiangxi Province. The provincial high school class for girls only exists in Nanchang. Those established by the church include Baoling in Nanchang and Ruli in Jiujiang. The provincial vocational school for girls originally had two departments: dyeing and weaving, and applied chemistry. From the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Department of Education plans to add the following two improvements: (1) Separate departments should be set up for sewing, weaving scarves, weaving socks, weaving cloth, and embroidery, enrolling elementary school graduates, with a time limit of one to two years as the principle. (2) The home economics department is actually in great need. The school should set up a home economics department in the next semester, focusing on family hygiene, nannies, food, and medical knowledge, enrolling junior high school students aged 15 or 16 and above. In addition to the above ten schools, there is a private women's handicraft school in Linchuan, with departments for knitting, embroidery, and weaving mats. It receives several hundred yuan in county subsidies annually, but the scale is very small. In the province as a whole, secondary schools for girls seem insufficient, and due to bandit disasters, the establishment of secondary schools for girls is mostly concentrated in northern Jiangxi. In terms of region, it seems not balanced or universal. This is the special situation of education in Jiangxi under the current special circumstances.</p>
<p>8. Implementation of Laws and Regulations for Elementary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>The implementation of the various regulations for elementary and secondary schools promulgated by the Ministry in this province is as follows: (A) Regarding secondary schools: (1) All former public and private secondary schools that only had junior levels have been uniformly renamed junior high schools. (2) The age standards for junior and senior high school students in the province are stipulated as 12 to 18 years old for junior high school admission and 15 to 21 years old for senior high school, which differs greatly from the age limits set by the Ministry. In consideration of the facts, the province plans to continue to follow the previous regulations. (3) Since the 21st year of the Republic (1932), private secondary schools have been ordered to no longer attach normal school departments in accordance with the regulations. However, the private Baoling Girls' Secondary School and the private Jiansheng Secondary School in Nanchang still have attached normal school classes. (4) The names of all provincial and jointly established secondary schools have been uniformly corrected. Private secondary schools that still use place names have been ordered to correct them in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. (5) School superintendent inspection reports are planned to be handled in accordance with regulations starting in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). (6) Jointly established or county-established secondary schools have never received subsidies. The regulations for private secondary school subsidies are currently being revised, limited to those who have received subsidies and have achieved truly excellent results. (7) The review of secondary school funding has stipulated regulations for the Economic Committee and regulations for the handling of funding matters by provincial educational institutions. Recently, regulations for provincial educational institutions have been re-established. (8) Last September, the provincial government meeting resolved that all secondary schools in the province should implement a co-educational separation system. However, in areas where girls' schools have not been established, the situation may be accommodated and handled with flexibility. (9) Each junior high school has one grade director per grade, and each senior high school has one department director per department. It is planned to be corrected in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). (10) The reorganization plan for each secondary school this year focuses on improving the quality of various facilities and has established regulations for the Unified Equipment Committee and measures for purchasing and storing equipment costs, which have already been implemented. (11) Students who fail in conduct or physical education are not allowed to participate in the graduation examination. (12) Public and private secondary schools have spring term classes, such as the Ganzhou Secondary School, Linchuan Secondary School, and Nanchang First Secondary School in the province, and private schools such as Jiansheng, Hongsheng, Zhicheng, Yaoxi, and Youyou. (13) According to the Jiangxi enrollment regulations, the number of students with equivalent academic qualifications admitted to junior high school may not exceed 10% of the total enrollment, and senior high school does not admit students with equivalent academic qualifications. However, starting in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), senior high schools are allowed to admit students who fail one or two subjects in the junior high school graduation examination as a trial, and they must still pass the supplementary examination for the failed subjects before they can become formal students. (14) The province has established regulations for scholarships and grants, which have not been implemented for long and were soon suspended due to insufficient funding. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), these regulations were revised and are currently being implemented. (15) The principals of provincial secondary schools in the province teach six hours per week and do not receive additional pay. (16) Since the 21st year of the Republic (1932), regulations have been established to prohibit concurrent employment and salary. (17) The province's three regulations, and the province's regulations, stipulate that part-time teachers must not account for more than one-third of the total number of teachers. Starting this year, it has been changed to follow the regulations of the Ministry.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of each province and city and the supervisory office for overseas students in Japan, stating, "The study period for publicly funded overseas students and the subsidy period for subsidized students in each province and city have been stipulated at the time of sending students abroad and approving subsidies. It has now been reported that among the overseas students receiving public funds or subsidies, there are cases where they have not actually enrolled or have already returned to the country but are still entrusting others to collect public funds or subsidies on their behalf.

<p>Regarding film review matters, the Film Review Committee is jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, with members from both ministries serving concurrently. The commissioner in charge of film matters in the Central Government has now signed and commented on the matter and submitted it to the Central Government, which has been sent to the Ministry of Education and other departments for review and reply. The original signed comments have three main points, which are roughly: (1) Members of the Film Review Committee must have a deep understanding of the Three Principles of the People and must have received higher education. (2) They must have a specialty in at least one foreign language (such as English, French, German, Japanese, etc.) (with English as the main one). (3) Committee members must be full-time. It is heard that the Ministry has expressed its agreement with this principle and will formulate measures based on the principle after a considerable period of time. In the future, film review committee members will be full-time.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Letter from Zhou Xiaozhen Jun Published as Is <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The esteemed editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I have read the "The Process of the Ministry of Education's Reply to Zhou Xiaozhen's Request to Issue the Tangram Phonetic Symbols," which was published in your newspaper's education news on January 12th. There are some points in it that do not match the facts, and I must request a correction. There are also some one-sided remarks that I must clarify. Since the matter is related to culture, I earnestly request that you disclose the following two main points and attachments in your newspaper to clarify the truth. (1) According to what your newspaper published, there are words such as "...the Ministry still approved the request of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to only allow the point of using tangrams to help practice phonetic symbols, only allow the game of phonetic symbols to be published freely, and be freely cast in lead type and printed for trial use, and when the book is published, the words 'Approved for distribution after review by the Ministry of Education' can be printed on the book..." These words do not match the facts. According to the Ministry's approval numbers 895, 930, 6036, and 9649, the phrases "free publication, free casting of lead type for printing trial use" and "the words 'Approved for distribution after review by the Ministry of Education' can be printed on the book..." refer specifically to the printed font of the Tangram Phonetic Symbols. This is something that I must request be corrected. (2) According to what your newspaper published, there are words such as "...refuting with six reasons, about a thousand words, all based on academic principles," etc. Please read Zhou Xiaozhen's 17th document submitted to the Ministry of Education to see whether it is based on logical academic principles. Moreover, its conclusion roughly states "...as for the proposed correction of the phonetic symbol printing style..." etc. To this day, the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee cannot point out which ones are slightly similar, which ones are tilted, which ones are skewed, and which ones have unclear strokes... These are all vague dismissals from three years ago, and the so-called "all based on academic principles" has not been refuted again since Xiaozhen's explanation. That is why the approval order was issued for free publication and free casting of lead type. Otherwise, since the Unification Committee had refuted it with two thousand words earlier, how could it have admitted it without reason later? This is the second point that I must clarify. After all, writing is a tool for teaching, and phonetic symbols are a tool to help recognize writing. Tools should be simple, sharp, universally applicable, and there is nothing mysterious about them. If one hears the words "Tangram" and immediately harbors contempt and aversion, and does not delve into its effectiveness, or even if it has been clearly recognized repeatedly in writing, and still cleverly denies it, as if tangrams damage dignity and nobility and are even worse than lying, then it is truly a misfortune for the future of the national language, and it is also why illiteracy in our country is not easily eliminated.</p>
<p>To faithfully offend the anger of the ruler, the crime is determined without pardon. Although, the Tangram Phonetic Symbols are indeed a precious raft of the national language and a savior for illiteracy. Xiaozhen has long been willing to sacrifice himself for it. Xiaozhen only knows to do his best to remove all obstacles for it, and to do his best to help it benefit the national language, benefit illiteracy, and benefit our Chinese nation. Whether the authorities pardon or not is not what I care about. Respectfully, I wish you peace. Zhou Xiaozhen bows, under the lamp on the 15th day of the first month of the 23rd year of the Republic.</p>

<p>▲ Meeting at 7 AM and Screening Films</p>
<p>▲ Welcome to Scouts of this city for visit</p>
<p>During the January 28th Shanghai War, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop organized a front-line stretcher team to participate in the Red Cross rescue work and a rear service team. All members were mobilized to cooperate with the military and various charitable organizations, and their work was extremely diligent. At that time, four Boy Scouts serving in the Red Cross rescue team, Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengwu, were sent by the Red Cross to rescue the family of a post office employee, Mr. Bai, in the war zone. They were captured by the enemy on the way and falsely accused of being spies, and tragically killed. Today marks the second anniversary of the martyrdom of the four martyrs. The troop will hold a memorial service in front of the memorial tower. In addition to representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and the Red Cross, all troop members and the families of the martyrs will attend. Scouts from this city are also welcome to attend.

<h3 id="e227">Shen Pengfei to Take Office This Week <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education announced Shen Pengfei as the acting president of Jinan University, Mr. Shen arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 28th. However, there are still some matters regarding school affairs that need to be requested from the Ministry of Education, so he has not yet gone to the school to assume his duties. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter drove to the school in Zhenru, but did not receive news of Mr. Shen's arrival. He later met with Mr. Shen, who said that the Ministry of Education had not yet replied, so he had not yet assumed his duties. The exact date of arrival is still uncertain, but he will definitely go to the school this week to handle school enrollment and registration matters.</p>
<p>After the Arrest of the Secretary of Minli Girls' High School</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Board of Directors Will Reorganize Automatically <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>▲ No News of Replacing the Principal</p>
<p>(Shanghai News) Wang Dazao, the secretary of the private Minli Girls' High School in this city, was arrested and investigated by the City Party Headquarters because he was a leftist who hosted the Chunqiu Theater Company and was suspected of propagating communism. The City Education Bureau dismissed Wang Subenyan, the principal of the school, for allowing the Communist Party and thoroughly reorganized the school's board of directors. All newspapers have reported on this matter. In order to clarify the details, a Shanghai News reporter went to the school yesterday to inquire about the news, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e229">No News of Replacing the Principal <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the school, the school secretary Wang Dazao was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on Friday of last week on suspicion of propagating communism. Other than the City Party Headquarters sending personnel to the school for investigation, there have been no other actions. There has been no news of replacing the principal. The City Education Bureau has not yet sent a document to the school, so all teachers and students staying at school during the winter break are still tutoring as usual. The junior high school department has started registration and fee collection today (the 30th) and is scheduled to start school on February 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Board of Directors Will Reorganize Automatically <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>However, according to another source, since the secretary of Minli Girls' High School, Wang Dazao, was arrested for propagating communism, the school's board of directors regrets the principal Wang Subenyan's negligence. In order to reorganize school affairs and refresh the school and strengthen the organization of the board of directors itself, it will be reorganized automatically and some new directors will be produced.</p>

<p>Discuss Ways to Reduce Rent</p>
<p>The movement to reduce rent in all circles of this city is now actively underway. The City Education Association, in order to unite the education community to participate together, yesterday issued a notice to all public and private schools in this city, stating, "Dear Sirs, Most school dormitories in this city are rented, and the annual rent is a heavy burden, so the school's affairs that should be developed and reformed cannot be carried out. Seeing this, the Association has resolved at the twenty-first regular meeting of this association to participate in the Shanghai Rent Reduction Movement Committee and has sent five representatives to attend. However, there are many schools in this city, and there is no investigation or statistics on the rent situation. Since this association is preparing to participate in the rent reduction movement, it seems that we should investigate the rental situation of each school in detail in order to gather and study it. We have scheduled a meeting of all public and private school principals in the city at 2 PM on February 5th at this association to discuss ways to reduce rent. This matter concerns education, so please attend on time and fill out the investigation form in detail and send it to this association immediately."</p>

<p>During the Fujian Incident, the entire Mawei Naval Academy left the school and traveled to Beijing on the Wanxiang Wheel. It has been almost two months. Now that the Fujian Incident has been quelled, the Ministry of the Navy has ordered the students of the school to return to the Mawei Naval Academy to resume classes. Yesterday, all the students, led by the director of the school, Huang Xianqi, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and are scheduled to take the Xinming Wheel to Fujian this morning.

<p>The president of the Mawei Naval Academy was originally General Du Xigui, a veteran of the Navy. After Mr. Du passed away in Shanghai, the Ministry of the Navy selected Mr. Zhu Tiansen, a counselor of the Ministry, to succeed him as president. The Central Government has already been petitioned to appoint him. Zhu is from Yangzhou, Jiangsu, and has a deep reputation and knowledge in the Navy. However, because Mr. Zhu's affairs in Beijing have not been completed, he cannot go to Mawei to take office immediately. He must go to Fujian to take office in a week.</p>

<p>The Xinming vessel, carrying all naval students, departed from Beijing at 4 PM on the 29th. It arrived at Xuehai yesterday afternoon. Due to the need to replenish fuel and food, the ship docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf upon arrival in Shanghai. Our reporter went to the vessel and met with Instructor Shen. He informed us that the naval students had been away from the school for two months and were now being led back to Mawei. Classes would resume immediately upon arrival. The total number of students was 132, divided into four classes. This trip was led by the Dean of Academic Affairs, Huang Xianqi. The teaching staff, including supervisors Zheng Changheng and Ye Jinqin, and instructor Chen Chenghui, totaling 24 people, also returned to the school on the same vessel.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Sailing to Mawei This Morning <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai to load coal and add food supplies. The crew members, having been away from Shanghai for a long time, also reported to the bureau about their duties in Beijing. The students and teaching staff remained on board, awaiting departure. It was scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at 4 AM this morning, heading directly for Mawei, Fujian. It is expected to arrive on Friday morning. It is said that a large number of books, instruments, and curriculum materials taken out of the school when the students left are now being carried back to the school by the Xinming vessel. The new principal, Zhu Tiansen, is said to be scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing within the next week to wait for the ship to go to Mawei and formally take over the position of principal.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Second Phase of City Education Association's Inspection of Private Schools Completed <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Education Association has sponsored more than twenty private schools this semester. To assess the performance of each school, the association divided the schools into phases for members of the board of directors and supervisors to inspect. It is now known that the second phase of inspection work has been completed. The results of the inspection show that the performance of the second and ninth private schools are the most outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Conditions of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library stated in the work report for 1933 that on May 1st of that year, the library moved to the upper floors of the Biefa Bookstore Company at 22 Nanjing Road. The new location occupies 4,000 square feet of floor space, with excellent lighting and sufficient space. It is divided into three rooms: one is a general reading room, where magazines and newspapers are placed and is free for public access; one is a subscription reading room, which provides newspapers, magazines, and reference books; and one is a book room, which occupies the most space and includes the catalog and lending desk. All rooms are equipped with heating, so readers can be comfortable. Regarding the acquisition of books, the cost of purchasing books was 2,400 taels, acquiring 393 novels, 165 general books, and 66 children's books. At the end of the year, the latest edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica and 40 new books on economics and finance were purchased for reference. A total of 1,200 books have been bound. Cataloging and recataloging work is in progress. Because there are 20,000 books in stock and they are constantly being borrowed, the cataloging work requires a long period of systematic effort. This year, 150 volumes were purchased thanks to donations. Mr. Yan E-sheng of the City Chamber of Commerce donated 3,800 volumes of Chinese books, which are now stored in newly made bookshelves. The Zilin Newspaper Office donated 11 books. There are many borrowers. Also, someone donated a complete set of "Historians' History," which has been placed in the reference room. This year, there are 65 Chinese and 535 foreign subscribers, totaling 600 people. The number of books borrowed is 54,121 novels and 6,671 other books. The library is now equipped with a public telephone, so that conversations will not disturb readers.</p>

<p>Mr. Xu Wancheng, who has taught in the city's educational circles for many years, recently opened the Longmen Bookstore at the Dananmen in Shanghai. It sells school textbooks, various books, magazines, stationery, and also acts as an agent for various book bureaus for libraries both locally and in other provinces, which is particularly convenient. In addition, Mr. Tang Zhouji, a graduate of Soochow University, is invited to supervise the production and sale of natural history specimens in both retail and wholesale, at low prices. The bookstore also accepts publications related to astronomy, mathematics, eugenics, and applied sciences. The bookstore has invited astronomer Ye Youqin to compile and publish "Common Sense of Astronomy" and "Table for Extracting Cube Roots." The bookstore is scheduled to open for business on February 5th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Commercial Library Reading Room was originally located on the second floor, which was narrow, poorly lit, and quite unsuitable. It is reported that the library, in view of this, has moved the reading room to the third floor, where the location and lighting are better than before. The reading room has also been greatly expanded, so that there will be no overcrowding. The reading time has now been changed to start at 10 AM, while the reading time is still from 12:30 PM to 8 PM. However, borrowing books still requires a reader's card.</p>

<p>▲Huzhou Girls' Middle School The Huzhou Girls' Middle School in Huzhou was founded in the late Qing Dynasty and has a long history. It is known for its strict teaching and high reputation. The magnificence of the school buildings and the perfection of the facilities are rare among middle schools in the interior. During the recent winter vacation, it has further expanded and added more than twenty bathrooms, and also drilled an artesian well and installed motors and hot and cold water pipes for the use of all faculty and students. Enrollment was originally scheduled for January 22nd, but because students from distant places have sent letters to register and requested an extension, it has now been specifically scheduled for February 10th as the second examination date. It is said that there are still vacancies in all grades of high school and junior high school.</p>
<p>▲Qinghua Primary School The Qinghua Primary School's senior elementary graduates of the 22nd year (1933) achieved excellent results in the joint examination by the Bureau of Education. In the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Middle School scholarship examination, Zhou Jiyi, a student in the second year of senior elementary school at the school, was also admitted due to his excellent results. He was sent to study in the first year of junior high school at Gezhi Public School by Chen Heqin and Chen Xuan Shan, directors of the Chinese Education Department. Not only did he receive tuition assistance, but the grade level of study also benefited. In addition, Zhang Zudao, a senior elementary school student, was also admitted without examination to study at the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Middle School due to his passing grades. It is said that there were a total of four participants from the school, and two were selected, which is quite difficult. The registration for new students at the school for the spring semester of the 23rd year (1934) is increasing daily. Detailed information can be obtained from Qinghua Primary and Middle School on Meibige Road, Racecourse, and parents are welcome to visit the school for face-to-face consultation and guidance.</p>

<p>American Women's Main Player Bai Nate Absent Due to Illness</p>
<p>Liangjiang Has an Excellent Opportunity to Retain the Championship</p>
<p>The final of the Xiqing Women's Basketball Championship will be held tonight between Liangjiang and the American Women's team, starting at 7:45 PM. Neither team has lost this year, so tonight's game will be exceptionally exciting and worth watching. However, it is very unfortunate that Ms. Bai Nate, the mainstay of the American Women's team, will be unable to play due to illness, which will have a significant impact. It is also an excellent opportunity for Liangjiang, making victory even more certain. Liangjiang has won the Xiqing Women's Championship for three consecutive years, but this year is the most tense. There has never been such a balanced force. The game will start at 7:30 PM. Downstairs seats in the Xiqing gym can be reserved. Upstairs unreserved seats will be sold at the door. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Team vs. Telephone Company 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. American Women 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Mailing vs. Junior Team 8:30 PM</p>

<p>First Game: Lost 3-4 to Fu Jen</p>
<p>(Beiping, 30th) The Shanghai Jiaotong University football expedition team visited Yanjing Tsinghua on the morning of the 30th, had lunch at Tsinghua, and played football at 2:30 PM. The first half ended 1-1, and the second half ended 0-0, resulting in a draw. The Jiaotong University team is scheduled to go to Tianjin tomorrow. In the first game of the Jiaotong University expedition against Fu Jen University, under the eyes of 5,000 spectators, they were defeated 4-3. After center Shen Guanlan was injured and left the field in the second half, they lost three goals in a row. The performance in the first half was not bad. Three minutes into the game, Wan Xianghua crossed from the left, and Zhou Guangzhong headed the ball in the center, opening the scoring. Ten minutes later, Jiaotong University scored another goal, but Fu Jen got a penalty kick. The first half ended 2-1. Only five minutes into the second half, Shen Guanlan was injured and left the field. Wan Xianghua was guarded, so Fu Jen launched a series of three attacks. Finally, Jiaotong University scored a goal, and the final score was 4-3.</p>

<p>▲Qingguang Defeats Feixia 38-29</p>
<p>| Two Notable Group A Games Tonight |</p>
<p>Last night, Qingxin of the Shanghai Basketball Association Group B forfeited, and Jianle won without a fight. The other two games in each of Group A and Group B did not have good performances. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Nanshang Defeats Jianmei (Group B) 49-36; (2) Seventh Team Defeats Youyou (Group B) 33-29; (3) Artillery Team Defeats Jewish Team (Group A) 52-49; (4) Qingguang Defeats Feixia (Group A) 38-29. There are only three games tonight, two of which are in Group A, which should be worth watching. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>This was a game in Group A, with a mediocre performance and little interest. However, the strengths were evenly matched, and the situation was very tense. From beginning to end, the scores went up and down, and it was difficult to separate the teams. The difference in score was often between one or two points. In the second half, the Artillery Team was once behind by six or seven points, but quickly caught up, and the situation became stalemate again. However, the Jewish team repeatedly took the lead. The Artillery Team made several efforts, and Chen Baoqiu finally scored a go-ahead basket at 44-45. Jewish player M. Gaberman was ejected for four fouls, and the score became 47-46 again. As you scored one basket, I scored one basket, until 49-50. The Jewish team besieged the basket but repeatedly missed opportunities. It seemed that their bad luck had arrived, and their fate was sealed. Chen Weimin of the Artillery Team scored again and again, making the score 52-49. The Artillery Team won with great difficulty.</p>

<p>The second Group A game, Qingguang against Feixia, the runner-up of the Xiqing Basketball Group B, had a similar situation to the previous Artillery Team vs. Jewish Team game. There was not much to say about the excitement, but the situation was balanced. There were no scores for three or four minutes at the beginning. Afterwards, each team made contributions, and the game passed uneventfully. In the first half, Qingguang reluctantly succumbed 17-14. When the second half started, Feixia suddenly slumped, and Qingguang took advantage of the situation, catching up from behind, making the score 22-17. Feixia rallied, and Gu Zhenhua surprisingly scored with his awkward shooting, making four consecutive baskets, and the situation changed again, 25-22. Qingguang continued to work hard, and Tan Dahua and others were not willing to lag behind, and continued to work hard, and finally won 35-29.</p>

<p>The performance of Nanshang and Jianmei in the two Group B games surpassed those of Group A. Both teams had good talent and deep accomplishments. Nanshang, with the remaining prestige of the Xiqing Group B championship, controlled Jianmei and swept through them, invincible. The Seventh Team's victory over Youyou was slightly inferior, but the situation was quite tense. Youyou's lineup was chaotic, with many flaws. Although Sun Huipei scored 22 points alone, it was still not enough to offset the losses, and they finally lost 29-33.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maddy's Throne Dethroned</p>
<p>Vannes Falls Behind</p>
<p>| Netball Rankings for 1933 |</p>
<p>(New York, 29th National Telegram) According to the rankings for 1933 announced by the American Lawn Netball Association, Hills is the American Netball King, and Ms. Jickel is the Netball Queen.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Vannes Not Listed <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The committee's choice of the top two is not surprising. Since Vannes's collapse and subsequent turn to professionalism, there is no doubt that he will no longer be included in the rankings. With Vannes gone, Hills stands out, winning five major championship tournaments, including Siblatd, Newpode, and Samsondun. Hills is also the semi-finalist in the All-American Congress.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Overcoming Mrs. Maddy <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>There is also no question that Ms. Jickel, having won the All-American Netball Congress Women's Championship, is ranked first. Her victory over Mrs. Maddy makes Ms. Jickel's throne even more valuable. The top spot is not a problem, but there is much discussion about Ellison being ranked second. The "short-necked" Ellison has not won a championship in the country, and his performance in the Davis Cup can be said to be equal to zero. The two or three people below him have better results than Ellison.</p>

<p>Other criticisms include Ms. Mable's ranking of third and Mrs. Faifley's ranking of fourth. Although Ms. Ma won the Mei Shidong Championship, Mrs. Faifley also won the Siblatuo Championship, which Ms. Jickel also participated in. Her replacement of Mrs. Maddy in the Deerman Cup also created a special record.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Stoke Fen Made the Most Progress <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The fastest-improving player is Stoke Fen. He was not listed in 1930, was ranked fifteenth in 1931, rose to sixth place last year, and jumped to third place this year. His future is unlimited. Hills's rapid progress is also amazing. His European tour was canceled last spring, and his performance was extremely poor. Hills worked hard and swept the Eastern Championships, like a landmine exploding, until he was eliminated by Crawford in the semi-finals of the All-American Congress. Rodd and Stoke Fen's doubles are also ranked first in the All-American Men's Doubles. The men's and women's rankings are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e257">The Decay of Lying by Yu Dafu <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"The Decay of Lying" is the title of an essay written in dialogue form by the aesthete Wilde. He criticized realism, recalled the illusory world of beauty in ancient times, and believed that the art of lying and fabricating rumors had declined to the point of extinction in modern times. Therefore, his contemporaries and the slightly older predecessor, Flaubert, were mocked by his aphorisms. He said that the reason why Americans have not created good literature is because their founding fathers did not know how to lie. The legend of Washington chopping down the cherry tree is a toxin that stifles the creative instincts of Americans.</p>
<p>Whether Wilde's exaggerated views are correct or not has already been discussed by many literary critics, so we will not bother with it for the time being. Looking back at the literati of China, both ancient and modern, I feel that they are indeed much less advanced than Westerners in the art of lying and fabricating rumors. King Cheng cutting tung leaves into jade tablets and playfully enfeoffing Shuyu was such an interesting and elegant affair, but Duke Zhou was too serious, and the best lie was exposed. Zhao Gao pointing at a deer and calling it a horse was also a good trick, but he had to add executions behind it to achieve a practical result. An interesting thing became a bad thing.</p>
<p>In modern times, this art of lying has become even more atrocious to the extreme. News reports often expose themselves because of lying, and the fabrication of rumors and lies in small publications is naturally even worse. To say nothing else, let's just talk about the reports about me personally. One publication just said that I was running around in Hangzhou, currying favor with third- and fourth-rate politicians, and got a job as a newspaper editor for thirty yuan a month; at the same time, another publication said that I was composing poems in the snow, and my leisure and elegance had reached an unparalleled level. In order to make this lie seem like the truth, this gentleman even racked his brains and made up several new and not-so-new, old and not-so-old, very original poems about snow for me. Do you think that with the art of spreading rumors declining to such a degree, can the Chinese nation still create great works?</p>
<h3 id="e258">On the Theory That Art Is Life <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Now that new literature no longer needs to exert effort in dealing with old literature, new literature itself has formed two major factions: (1) The "art for art's sake" faction, and (2) the "art for life's sake" faction.</p>
<p>The "art for art's sake" faction says that artistic creation is only for the sake of art itself, and definitely not for any other purpose. The "art for life's sake" faction, however, says that art is not just for art's sake, but to improve the current situation or advance society. However, although these two factions once debated fiercely without yielding, it has now become a thing of the past and no longer shows any traces of contention. Moreover, although someone may occasionally bring it up, the two factions of "art for art's sake" and "art for life's sake" no longer seem to be in clear opposition.</p>
<p>However, what I want to say now is not about the past disputes between the two factions, but that artistic creation can never be solely for the sake of art. Artistic creation is for life, but not necessarily for the general life as the "art for life's sake" faction says, but for the creator's own life.</p>
<p>Yes, the creator's creation is part of the creator's life.</p>
<p>Now, let's take literature and art as an example. When a novelist writes a novel and publishes it somewhere, his purpose is always either for fame or for profit, or, at least, to vent his inner depression or anger. In short, the reason he writes it is nothing more than to satisfy a certain desire of his own, so it cannot but be a part of his life. Even if he writes it and does not publish it, but tears it up, burns it, or buries it in the soil, it is also a kind of life for him, because he does so to seek satisfaction of one of his desires.</p>
<p>Will a novelist who writes for fame or profit fail to become a novelist? No, there is no reason for him not to become a novelist, if his novel is a good novel, a crystallization of his own hard work, and a powerful work that can move people. We know that many of Balzac's works in "The Human Comedy" were forced out of him because he had to pay off debts, but that did not hinder the artistic value of his works.</p>
<p>Therefore, a work should be judged on its own merits, and the motive for writing it, whether for fame or profit, is not of great importance. Moreover, the creator's motive for creation always has a source, even if it is not necessarily in fame or profit, because it cannot but be a part of his life.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Snow <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>On snowy days, I think of home.</p>
<p>A heart like a breaking wave, impossible to settle. Depressed eyes, staring at the snowflakes outside the window, falling one by one. Life is like the falling snowflakes. Wandering dreams, lost youth, solitary trek on this gloomy path of life. It has been more than two years since I went home. It is already deep winter, my body is bleakly cold, and my heart is also bleakly cold! I just think: the snow in my hometown must be falling in large swathes, covering the whole earth in white. I love the snow in my hometown, the snow in my hometown hides the spring of my childhood.</p>
<p>However, the snow in my hometown is now stained with scarlet blood! We must not lightly forget that lost free home!</p>
<p>I can't help but say it's a sad thing, since the September 18th Incident, the home has been broken, and the people at home have been exiled, so I slowly forgot about home! Then, with the strength of life, I began to tread firmly and embark on the road forward.</p>
<p>My heart is warm, and I am looking forward to the light of the future!</p>
<p>Sometimes, my heart smiles and whispers: Quickly follow the wheels of history and turn to a new stage!</p>
<p>So, I was reborn.</p>
<p>I have no home. I wander everywhere. I have identified a direction.</p>
<p>I have tasted a lot of the bitterness of life alone; this journey of life is so long and far!</p>
<p>Often a little stimulation makes me neglect my progress, which is my greatest shortcoming! However, I always remember that people must move forward to be able to live.</p>
<p>I have already forged myself into a person who is used to living an alien life. But at the same time, I have also become a melancholy person; I didn't smile in spring, I didn't smile in summer, and I didn't smile even more in autumn. In winter, I stare at the snowflakes outside the window, adding to my sorrow!</p>
<p>Whenever a deep winter comes, my heart has to encounter a heavy illness, and I grieve even more at the white snow!</p>
<p>Now, the winter is deep in Qingdao, where I am staying, and my heart is also heavily ill! I can't help but sing a lament to this first snow.</p>
<p>So, I thought of home.</p>
<p>Home, has already sunk into the Northeast, which has become "Manchukuo"! The deep winter in the Northeast must be a beautiful world of snow!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Impressions of the Burmese <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>On the way from Xiaotianba at the foot of the Savage Mountain directly to Bamo, the Burmese driving the passenger car suddenly stopped the car and jumped into the forest beside the road. What are they doing? The passengers opened their curious eyes and looked, oh, it turned out that the Burmese was touched by the sound of cicadas in the forest and was interestingly searching for the sobbing cicada.</p>
<p>This is my first impression of the Burmese. Although it is very ordinary, it made me pay deep attention to them, and I have not forgotten it until now. That was in the spring of 1927. (If we talk about Myanmar, there is no spring, we should only say it is the dry season). When I go to a place, I always like to study the temperament of those foreigners, and I like to compare the people I have contacted before, to find out their differences. Because this is the joy of traveling, I am happy to do so.</p>
<p>I think the Burmese are younger than the Chinese nation, and they have a strong childish and playful temperament. In Mandalay (the old capital of Myanmar) and in Yangon, I have seen that if there are a few Burmese young people walking around the streets, it is not difficult to encounter the entertaining things of singing and clapping hands. As for the public buses running in the city, the happy situation of the Burmese people riding in them, reaching out from the windows to clap and shout, sometimes flashes across the tree-lined streets, arousing the surprise and smiles of distant travelers.</p>
<p>We Chinese are not like this, we are always solemn and quiet. Even at the most joyful times, like celebrating the Lunar New Year, there is still no unrestrained singing and wanton playfulness. Ordinary people, especially farmers in the countryside, on the contrary, dress neatly on New Year's Day and become pretentious. Probably today's inland farmhouses still have such couplets posted in front of their doors: "Everyone acts like a gentleman, everywhere there is a style of yielding and courtesy." Isn't this a good portrayal of the New Year?</p>
<p>In Myanmar, I have encountered several Burmese New Years, and those happy days are around mid-April in the Gregorian calendar. What do you think those Burmese people with childish temperaments play? Oh, they carry buckets and ladles, gather in the streets and alleys, and when they see people wearing new clothes, regardless of men and women, regardless of old and young, they splash a ladle of cold water on your head, followed by again and again, again and again, until you immediately become a miserable sight like a drowned dog. If you are sitting in a tram or car, water will also fly in from the window. On these days (only three days), water flowers are flying everywhere, overflowing with laughter, and the Burmese are all as happy as if they were crazy.</p>
<p>When I return to China, I often feel that everything around me is too dull, too old, and the blood of young people must be injected.</p>

<p>— Huan Ming</p>
<p>In recent years, the types of dreams have gradually become more numerous, but in these dreams of mine, there are very few about my hometown. In the past, although I had many dreams about my hometown, that was in my childhood. The period when I dreamed about my hometown the most was in the one or two years not long after I left my hometown. What I dreamed of was nothing more than those elders who loved me and the material satisfaction that I could not enjoy outside. After waking up, I would clamor to return to my hometown, even crying.</p>
<p>As the days went by, I became accustomed to the life outside; the dreams of my hometown also diminished like my longing for my hometown. Although I still dreamed about it occasionally, the hometown I dreamed of was already decorated with cars and carriages, and even the streets of my hometown were asphalt.</p>
<p>When I told my father about this kind of dream, he was dumbfounded: in fact, there were no rickshaws in my hometown, and he sighed sadly:</p>
<p>"You have forgotten your home, you have been away for too long, one should not forget one's roots..."</p>
<p>So, I returned to my hometown that winter.</p>
<p>As a result, I left my hometown before I had lived there for two weeks. Since then, I have rarely dreamed about my hometown. Maybe I occasionally have this kind of dream, but none of them can arouse my lingering feelings. Everything in the dream hometown is vulgar, old, and the roads are uneven (more uneven than the real hometown). After waking up, I feel depressed and unhappy, even ashamed to recall it.</p>
<p>People are originally like this, and the evolution of society is precisely because people can be like this. The evolution of society is a contradictory cycle. After being tired of the turning of the wheels and the clamor of the city, I began to dream of my hometown again. My hometown is quietly unfolding in my dream: green trees, flowing water, fields, and the twittering of birds! My hometown is beautiful.</p>
<p>My hometown is probably covered in white snow now, I think. When my hometown really appears before my eyes, I will definitely be disappointed, but I have decided to return to my hometown again. Life is originally a contradictory deception, people say: "The purpose of life is not in the purpose itself, but in the process." Then, on the way home, I think I can always satisfy my hometown's wish for me.</p>

<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>Lian Di became even more shy listening to this.</p>
<p>"Third Aunt, it's hard to say at this point. There's no other way. Lian Di, light the lamp."</p>
<p>"This world can't be said like that anymore. Times have changed. Our Madam was raised by the third wife, and isn't she enjoying blessings? In the mansion, the status may be a little lower, but life is always good, and there's no shortage of clothes, food, or anything else."</p>
<p>Lian Di didn't understand and went to light the lamp. She felt a bit of novelty, thinking that her mother had brought back a rare guest from burning incense in the city, which was really rare.</p>
<p>A large wisp of black smoke rose from the flame of the small bottle-shaped kerosene lamp without a lampshade. The light was very weak. The Zhong Kui in the dusty hall looked like a piece of old paper, and people's shadows were vaguely reflected on the wall. Aunt Qin and Third Aunt were whispering.</p>
<p>Aunt Qin's mysterious air made Lian Di feel a little strange, and Lian Di was also surprised why Third Aunt was also so secretive. She only saw one side of Third Aunt. She had the shrewdness of city people, dressed neatly, and the golden earrings hanging from her earlobes shone with a lovely light. Compared to Aunt Qin, she was much more glamorous.</p>
<p>"Lian Di looks really delicate. Lian Di, Third Aunt says you are lucky, remember that."</p>
<p>Third Aunt smiled and looked at Lian Di. Lian Di was only seventeen years old. Due to the operation of various farm and household chores, her body was developing very well. She originally had a very sturdy body, but she had been enduring famine for too long recently and had become thin. She had good looks, with a round face carrying the innocence and shyness of a young girl. The young men of Yuhua Village called her "Sister Hua". Although she was thin recently, it made her appear slender. Third Aunt thought that if she could eat and dress well again, wouldn't she become a beauty after a while?</p>
<p>Listening to this, Lian Di felt at a loss, and the eyes under her slender eyebrows were shyly about to close. She twisted her body shyly and walked into the dark little room.</p>
<p>She really couldn't bear for her daughter to leave her, but could she let her starve to death in the countryside? What could she do if she couldn't bear it? She couldn't help complaining to Third Aunt, saying that the days were getting harder and harder, and they always relied on the harvest from the land, but it was getting worse every year, and the harvest from the land was never enough to live on. "Third Aunt, we can't rely on the land anymore, what can we rely on?"</p>
<p>"I heard that relief wheat is going to be distributed, but I don't know when."</p>
<p>"It doesn't count until it's distributed. If it's distributed earlier, my daughter won't leave. If we wait any longer, aren't we just waiting to starve to death?"</p>
<p>"Aunt Qin, rely on Lian Di. Look at it later."</p>
<p>In the evening, Lian Di felt very uneasy in front of Third Aunt. She thought: Why is Third Aunt always looking at me? What is she looking at me for? Mom also looks a little strange, does she have something on her mind? Why does she want to say it but not say it, and she seems happy and unhappy at the same time? Why is Third Aunt always smiling? Lian Di didn't understand and couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>Aunt Qin hesitated several times before stuttering:</p>
<p>"Lian Di, you go to the city tomorrow to borrow rice, go with Third Aunt."</p>
<p>This unexpected news made Lian Di very happy. She raised her head and said excitedly:</p>
<p>"Mom, how much to borrow? How much to borrow? I'll go, I'll go."</p>
<p>Lian Di's joy was what Aunt Qin expected, but she had to say what Third Aunt said:</p>
<p>"Just carry as much as you can. If you can carry three dou, then three dou, if you can carry five dou, then five dou. Don't be impatient when you get to the city, other people's rice isn't waiting there for us to eat. Listen to Third Aunt, it doesn't matter if it takes three or five days. Come back when you have the rice."</p>
<p>"Mom, I can carry six dou, look, I can still walk carrying a load of rice." Lian Di was a little carried away.</p>
<p>"Just carry as much as you can. But don't overwhelm yourself."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." Lian Di thought, if I could carry back a load, that would be great. But even a cloth bag would be considerable.</p>
<p>Lian Di smiled because of her mother's words, and her mother and Third Aunt smiled because the idea was sold. Lian Di saw them smiling and looking at her at the same time, especially Third Aunt's sharp eyes, as if she wanted to find something on her face. She was afraid that a small scar by her hair and a black mole above her ear would be seen by Third Aunt, so she shyly turned her head away and felt uneasy.</p>
<p>After Third Aunt went to sleep, Lian Di whispered to her mother about her curiosity about Third Aunt. Her mother said that Third Aunt had gone to the city, gotten lucky, and made a fortune. Lian Di said in an envious tone in a low voice:</p>

<h3 id="e263">Gold Rises Again After Major Players Cover Short Positions <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Gold Standard Drops and Then Rises</p>
<p>Rumors Spread that Britain and the United States Will Discuss Currency</p>
<p>Market Situation Firm and Rebounds by One Yuan</p>
<p>Although the gold market was weak at the opening yesterday, it ended up falling and then rising. Major players in the market covered short positions, leading to a firm market situation throughout the day. In the morning, due to the rise in overseas silver markets in both Britain and the United States, the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange also jumped by one and a fraction to one and one-and-a-half cents. Exchange rates also rose, and American cotton rose by nineteen basis points, and American wheat rose by two and three-seven-five basis points. This led to continued fear in the market. The opening price of the gross market fell to eighty-three or four yuan, but because the opening price was too low, major players made some advances, and the situation stabilized. There was news from Reuters that Britain and the United States were about to begin currency talks, which led to a stable situation after the opening. After entering the market, although the HSBC posted price rose sharply, the banks tried to grab the volume, and speculators Wu and Lu actively purchased, gradually breaking through the ninety-yuan barrier, rebounding to ten yuan. This was because Reuters reported that the Wall Street Journal carried news that Britain and the United States were already conducting informal negotiations, and that the exchange rate of the pound would be stabilized at four dollars and seventy-five cents to the US dollar. Subsequently, Reuters reported that the currency case might be submitted to the President tonight, and the President will issue a notice immediately reducing the gold content of the US dollar by forty percent, and the Treasury Department denied discussing currency with Britain and announced plans to use the new Stabilization Fund of 200,000 yuan. The price once fell back, but the domestic market was extremely tight. Due to hedging activities by the industry and active short covering by major players, the market continued to be firm at noon. The external market was once lower after the market, but the market situation was quite flat after the opening. After entering the market, the market sentiment was stronger, which led to a rise in market prices, but there were many plateauing, and there were no special changes. The price of clam red was 1,094 yuan. The situation of the day is recorded below.</p>

Mitsui bought US dollars for April at 8125, and Dalian Gang Yifeng, Yongheng, Yu Zhifeng, Yongxiang, Heyuan Mao, Hengxing, Yuan, etc. all advanced, and the price rose to 9.8 yuan, but because HSBC announced in advance that the British exchange would rise by 25 and the US exchange by 75, there was quite a lot of supply. Yi Da, Yong Da, Da Fa, and Yong Lai sold, and the price retreated to 7.5 yuan. Huabi ate US dollars for May at 875, and Zhifeng, Yongheng, and Yu paid, and the price rose again to 9 yuan.

Due to unfavorable overseas news, the price fell to 1.8 yuan. Yuanshengyong took advantage of the low price to make a payment, and the situation remained strong. Although Guangbang had supply after entering the market, Dadecheng Heng Yu Yida Yong Qingfa Yong still came to vigorously purchase due to the urgent domestic market, and the price rose to 7.8 yuan. Goods were sold, and the price once fell to 6.3 yuan. Hongxing, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Qianchangxiang competed to advance, and the price rose to 8.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e268">March Term Bonds Debut Yesterday <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Market Very Lively, Prices Up 0.12 to 0.75 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, March term futures began trading, and the market was quite lively. In the afternoon, due to excessive trading and busy procedures, only one session was conducted. The market price surged after the holiday, as the market had been brewing for a while. The short-term "jin" (gold) rose by more than one yuan. The situation was due to multiple parties aggressively pushing up the far-term, raising it significantly. The difference between near and far-term market prices was minimal, and market sentiment was very firm. Short sellers were slightly panicked, and there was a considerable profit from spread trading. Therefore, the short sellers in the second session did quite a bit of spread trading. "Cai Bing" (Disbandment Bonds) surged by as much as 0.7 yuan. Afterwards, long buyers slightly emerged, weakening by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Trading was extremely active. The afternoon session was delayed until after 4 PM to begin trading. The previous series was slightly smaller by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, starting from 19 Good Debt, which improved by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Both long and short sides were hesitant. Afterwards, #32 wildly sold short "jin", retreating slightly by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. The situation seemed to be flagging. Market sentiment was still bullish due to the stable environment. However, it was uncertain whether the Southwest would remain silent, and the short sellers sold based on this. Therefore, the afternoon showed a slightly hesitant situation. Currently, if all parties are at peace, the generally recognized bullish side still has a potential of 1 or 2 yuan. Let's reserve this statement and observe what happens later. Yesterday's market price results showed a slight increase of 0.12 to 0.75 yuan. "Jin" long was slightly smaller by 0.1 yuan, and "96" was smaller by 0.045 yuan. The total transaction volume was 19,194,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods, 6,385,000 yuan in term unified salt tax, 2,640,000 yuan in "Cai Bing", 1,495,000 yuan in 19 Customs Good Debt, 2,890,000 yuan in 20-volume 20 Customs, 3,250,000 yuan in "Jin" short unified #6, and 1,735,000 yuan in "96", with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to four or five hundred thousand.</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that on the 29th, the New York stock market traded actively, with various stocks rising by several "jiao" to 7 yuan. This was because the public had a positive reaction to the passage of the currency bill, and commercial news was generally favorable to the long side. Many stocks rose to new high prices. The New York Statistical Company's 50 industrial stocks reached a new high since 1931. The Dow Jones 30 industrial stocks were also less than 1 yuan away from the 1933 high. Bonds and commodities both rose. The total daily transaction volume was 2.78 million shares.

<h3 id="e270">Not Much January Yarn and Cotton Delivery <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Only 700 Bales of Yarn and 15,500 Piculs of Cotton</p>
<p>The auction of January yarn started on August 1st of last year, with a price of 195.6 yuan. Later, due to disappointing autumn sales, rural decline, and economic hardship, yarn sales became increasingly sluggish. In addition, foreign yarns were being dumped from all sides, and the production and sales areas of Chinese yarn were invaded. Chinese yarn became increasingly surplus, inventory continued to rise, and the market showed increasing cracks, trending downwards step by step, directly breaking through the 180 yuan mark. On October 16th, a cotton industry organization was established to maintain the market price, which rebounded to 186-187 yuan. However, actual demand remained sluggish. It was heard that the Zhejiang military situation was serious, and that a large factory and a certain association's long positions had no intention of taking delivery, and were settling at the market price. With this large amount of chips being dumped, it was like a dam collapsing, and the price plummeted to 173-174 yuan in two or three days. Moreover, there were very large changes, and the struggle between long and short positions was fierce. According to market rumors, the exchange's shareholder group organized to maintain a limited price of 170 yuan for the near-term yarn delivery, and sold it externally. The market was temporarily stabilized by this, rising slightly to 74.4 yuan. By the middle of this month, due to weak actual demand and long positions settling, the final session was still at 170 yuan. As a result, 700 bales remained, and only 250 bales of 20-count "San Yang" yarn were actually delivered. The rest was self-delivered. The brokers and brands of both delivery and receiving parties are listed below:</p>

<p>The January term "Zheng Biao" cotton was listed on August 1st of last year, with a price of 44.05 yuan. It rose slightly to 4.23 yuan. Although the US Department of Agriculture had implemented a plan to destroy one-quarter of the cotton fields, the harvest was abundant, and the market was still difficult to stabilize. On August 8th, the government announced that the production situation was good, and the market price fell, causing a unified shock in the world cotton market. At the same time, the price of rice and paddy in China was low, farmers increased cotton fields, rainfall was favorable, and cotton production was abundant. The market fell step by step, breaking through the 40 yuan mark in mid-October. The lowest was 38.5 yuan. Later, the moisture content of the new cotton was too high, and although there was a source, the delivery did not match. At the end of the year, the problem of cotton industry between Japan and India was resolved. Indian cotton first rose, and US cotton also rose. The market was excited, and the auction cotton rose from 39.8 yuan straight to over 42 yuan. By the end of the month, there was still no sufficient chips on the delivery side. The final peak price was 42.4 yuan, 2.6 yuan higher than last month's price. As a result, 15,500 piculs remained, and the delivery price was 42 yuan. Among them, 5,000 piculs were self-delivered. The names and quantities of the brokers of both delivery and receiving parties are listed separately below.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Not Much Spot Yarn and Cotton Consumption <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>(Cotton Yarn) Spot sales are extremely sluggish, and no gangs are making progress. Firstly, the end of the year is approaching, and accounts are being closed. Secondly, foreign yarn prices are cheap, and sales are fierce in all regions, which is increasingly affecting Chinese yarn. As for the overseas cotton market, although it has risen, the foreign exchange rate has lengthened, and the relationship with the silver plate is less fresh. The total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the day is only 175 bales. The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 41 Nanjing 5 Peer 5</p>
<p>Inland 104 Yunnan 20</p>
<p>(Cotton) Calm, but although foreign cotton has risen, the foreign exchange rate is extremely long, and there is little change in the silver plate calculation. Therefore, market sentiment is still flat. Yarn sales are quite clear, factory demand is stagnant. Sources include 1,306 bales of Yao cotton and 640 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market rose due to speculator purchases, favorable political news, and strength on Wall Street. As a result, spot goods rose by 20 points per pound, and futures rose by 19 to 26 points. Liverpool cotton spot goods rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 9 to 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points. The Bombay cotton market saw short covering, but was offset by long covering and Japanese selling. As a result, Pingar rose by 2.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 2.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 2.75 rupees. The original cable is recorded on the left. (</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, all months showed signs of appreciation. Foreign wheat quotations showed Chicago continuing to rise by about 0.6 to 0.7 yuan, and Canada rising by about 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. In addition, there was only one day of trading this month, and the struggle between long and short positions was very intense. The long speculators prepared to take delivery and gradually raised prices, while most of the short sellers prepared to deliver and were unwilling to lower prices to cover. Therefore, although the market showed improvement, transactions were not very smooth. After the opening in the afternoon, the situation this month was still intense, and the highest price reached 2.225 yuan. However, after this peak, the price gradually softened, with external long speculators letting go, falling back by 0.01 yuan. For the far-term, inland factories slightly sold, also showing loosening. As a result, this month rose by 0.0175 yuan compared to the previous day, February improved by 0.0075 yuan, March improved by 0.01 yuan, April improved by 0.0075 yuan, May improved by 0.01 yuan, and June improved by 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Only Two Months of Term Wheat Auctioned Open <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the term wheat market remained extremely quiet after the opening of the morning and afternoon sessions. Because the settlement date was approaching, both local and foreign buyers and sellers were engaged in closing positions. Although foreign wheat prices changed frequently, the market situation was as calm as usual. Only February and June had open transactions throughout the day, and the rest were empty auctions. As a result, February remained unchanged, and June improved by 0.06 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e275">North Shanghai Again Stopped Measurement Yesterday <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Carters and Porters Restarted Their Dispute</p>
<p>South Shanghai Long-grained Rice Continued to Rise by 0.05 Yuan as a Result</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of each gang in South Shanghai was more than 30 (nearly 5,000 "shi" - a unit of dry volume), and the market situation was tight because the dock workers in Zhabei were competing for work and holding each other back, causing the industry in the north of the city to shut down entirely. However, the actual situation was still normal. Only the sellers seemed to have the intention of raising prices. As a result, the long-grained rice of Chang Bang Su and Tong was raised by 0.05 yuan. As for the late rice of Qingjiao Songjiang and Jiangxi Lian, the retail market was still weak. The sales were heavily reliant on the Yang-style gangs in the north and south, and there were continued transactions of 2,000+ bales. The market situation was excellent, and the price rose by 0.5 "chi" (a unit of length, also used here as price per unit). However, Du Jiao Yang and other patterns were average, and there was not much difference between Yin-styled and plain styles. In North Shanghai, at about 9 AM yesterday, a few firms opened for measurement. As the carters were working, the porters suddenly started to fight over the trade. Both sides clashed and bled, and several people were injured. The firms could not open for measurement because of this, and they successively closed down to prevent accidents. After the Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order, each firm waited for the Rice Association to resolve the matter before they could resume as normal. So there was no market report.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Guest-origin Glutinous Rice Rose Again Outward <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou-Style Operations Very Dense</p>
<p>Merchants Unwilling to Let Go Easily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gate of the guest-origin long-grained rice became more and more active. Because the "Zha" style operations were done by the local guest gangs, the market has continued to rise, so it has been hard to get into the game. The Quanzhou gang has also not competed, so the market has been solely led by the provincial gang. However, merchants said that in recent days, sources have not been prosperous, and the product price has gradually increased. Since there would be very few shipments at the end of the lunar year, most refuse to sell off. The market has become more tense. Yesterday's city Xian Yuan and other rice types have all risen outward, across the board. About 4,500 bales were sold in the city, but only 100+ bales were purchased by Ji Jing here. All the rest was operated by the Min provincial gang. The after-market is still bullish. Because the Min gang still has a big appetite, it may be enough to shake the market, speaking only of the Fuzhou gang. Furthermore, there is the need for the Quanzhou gangs to continue to inquire, so the market and market sentiment all have the hope of expansion.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Mid-Quality Soybeans Continue to Rise by 0.03 Yuan <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's bean market trend was slightly better. Sources are difficult to find in the short-term, and the purchasing power from factories continues. There has also been inquiries from the local region and for export. The sales price of high-quality soybeans has decreased slightly, and the market has generally been stable. The buying power from factories of medium- and low-quality goods is still strong, and they alone rose by 0.02-0.03 yuan. This street purchased one truckload of Zhengyangguan soybeans, with a price of 3.47 yuan. The Fuzhou gang purchased 180+ bags of large Yingzhou soybeans, with a price of 3.43 yuan. Factories purchased 5 truckloads of medium-sized soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.40 to 3.47 yuan. In addition, 2 truckloads of Linhuaiguan soybeans were sold, with prices of 3.22 and 3.14 yuan. 1 truckload of Haozhou soybeans was also sold, with a price of 3.35 yuan. Moreover, the Ningbo gang purchased 200+ bags of Mountain soybeans, with an asking price of 3.40 yuan.</p>

<p>In the local tea market, transactions by foreign firms have recently stagnated because of few sales of tea from inland firms, and because the tea from local firms does not suit consumer tastes. The market is completely at a standstill. However, domestic sales are becoming more active. A backlog of low-grade black tea from Hubei and Ningzhou has recently been manufactured and exported by tea companies such as Tong Yu Taihua Tea, with a volume of no less than 3,000 boxes. It is said that the sales channels in Yingkou and Niuzhuang are the widest, and there are also sporadic sales in Qingdao and Tianjin.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a continued downward trend as both Customs Gold Standard and the gold standard fell, while the Dutch exchange rate rose. The association quoted 24 crude granulated white sugar spot at 19.5 yuan, while the price of the goods at this firm was 19.6 yuan, a decrease of 10 cents from the previous day. Ordinary Dutch red sugar was quoted at 15.4 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar's B mark was offered at 20 yuan without a deal. The factory's Zhenyu No. 1 refined white sugar was offered at 18.8 yuan, down 10 cents, also without a deal. Over a hundred packages of new domestic refined red sugar continued to open at a price of 14.8 yuan, with no change. Transactions of Chaoshan youth sugar suddenly increased yesterday, with a total of over a thousand packages opened. The higher-end price was 12 yuan to 11.8 yuan, the next level was 11.6 yuan to 11.4 yuan, and the lowest was 11 yuan. The prices were said to be reasonable.</p>

<h3 id="e281">On the Rent Reduction Movement <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Anyone with a little experience living in Shanghai will surely feel that the rent problem is the heaviest burden of their entire life. Workers who toil every day to earn thirty to fifty cents, even though they live in filthy and cramped slums like pigeon cages, still have to spend two dollars a month for half a bed space, or three dollars for half an attic or a small room. A white-collar worker with a monthly income of about fifty dollars finds it hard to keep his rent below ten dollars, while a freelancer with an income of about a hundred dollars spends around thirty dollars on rent. Rent expenses account for more than a quarter of the total income of these people. Therefore, they not only have to shed extra blood and sweat for the landlords, but also constantly toss and turn in agony over the rent problem. As for important figures who have fallen from political grace or wealthy merchants with a knack for making money, some buy their own houses, while others spend eighty to a hundred taels a month on rent, which is like plucking a hair from a bull. The rent problem is of no concern to these "people above people."</p>
<p>Because rental income is a high-interest and very stable source of income, all capitalists, bureaucrats, and various resident foreigners in Shanghai focus their attention on the real estate business through their money-grubbing ways. Amid the current social situation of economic depression in all sectors, this has created a distorted phenomenon where investment in the real estate business is the most active, enjoying unique prosperity. Landlords or major landlords exploit the second landlords using "scientific methods," while the second landlords exploit the third tenants using "Shanghai tricks." In between, there is a group of "reaching generals" of rent-collecting clerks who come up with all kinds of tricks like "extra rent," "hidden fees," and "key money" to extract money from Shanghai residents. The rent-collecting clerks display the same arrogance as collecting police donations to intimidate the second landlords, and the second landlords put on a most unhygienic face to deal with the third tenants. As a result, the general public becomes thinner and thinner, while the major landlords become fatter and fatter. The income of the intermediary layers and the second landlords is also considerable.</p>
<p>Because the "housing" problem in Shanghai is the most distorted and the "tricks" are the most complicated, it is very difficult to rent either newly built houses with sanitary facilities or older houses with lower rents. Renting newly built houses is almost always calculated in taels of silver, at least thirty-five taels or more. With one month's rent as deposit, one month's rent in advance, and renovation costs, one cannot even inquire without two or three hundred dollars. In the case of older houses with slightly lower rents that will not be renovated recently, there is definitely a layer of heavy exploitation by the original tenants. The so-called "renovation," which consists of nothing more than a few electric lights, is said to require a "transfer fee" of five hundred to eight hundred dollars. For city houses located in the commercial center, extra rent easily reaches thousands of dollars, and hidden fees often amount to tens of thousands. Since the rent is expensive and the rules are numerous, the property tax is also incredibly high. The annual extra tax for the Yile Garden on Nanjing Road has increased to 7,500 dollars this year, and that for Tong Huaichun has increased to 6,240 dollars. With these property tax figures that can be viewed as a world wonder, we truly cannot help but admit that they are both "great" and "big"! "The wool comes from the sheep." Those who pay high prices for hidden fees, transfer fees, extra rent, property tax, and rent have no reason to pay out of their own pockets. As a result, they naturally pass on all the losses to the common people of Shanghai. Isn't it the small citizens and the working masses who suffer?</p>
<p>The soaring rent and land prices in Shanghai year after year are certainly not entirely due to the manipulation of capitalists, but also to other reasons. One is that domestic warfare and bankruptcy have made the trend of the rich and the poor concentrating in cities even more acute. The former indirectly increased the source of investment in the real estate industry, and the latter increased the demand for housing in Shanghai society. The second is that in recent years, the number of great figures who have scraped the land with a bold spirit and filled their own pockets has increased compared to the past. The most "safe" areas in their minds, besides the United States, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Dalian, are the "British Concession" or "French Concession" in Shanghai. They not only build private residences for their own enjoyment, but also build many new lane houses and villages to "serve society"!</p>
<p>When things reach an extreme, they will revert. The burden of rent is oppressing the vast majority of Shanghai citizens to the point of difficulty in breathing. Therefore, the recent rent reduction movement has developed from a widespread sentiment into a broad action. The declaration of various Shanghai organizations to reduce rent says: "If one cannot live in peace and work with joy, it is not just the inability of one family or one store to survive, but the common inability of all families and stores in the city to survive. Moreover, those who come from poor areas and obtain the qualification of Shanghai tenants are even more unable to survive." This is not simply complaining, but a tragic cry of blood and tears mixed together from the citizens of Shanghai!</p>
<h3 id="e282">A Maiden Before Marriage <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhang</p>
<p>I don't know why, even I can't figure it out! Lately, my heart always feels a kind of indescribable sweetness!</p>
<p>Sometimes, they nag that I'm acting like a new bride. Staying with him all day long, and no longer playing with them! But then, a surge of heat rushes to my ears, and I get annoyed! They tease me mischievously, saying: Your face is so red, like a big persimmon cake! Really, I feel shy and excited! I think of him, a lovely shadow! My Chen ge! I can't help but smile to myself, but then I pull back as if someone is watching!</p>
<p>Mom is the busiest because of my marriage! And the most painstaking. She always thinks of the trivial things that I don't even think of. She asks the same questions over and over again, sometimes it really makes me annoyed! But later, when I think about it carefully, only my mother truly loves and cares for me wholeheartedly. Item by item, preparing the dowry is the most worrying!</p>
<p>I often tell Mom that we don't need too much! After all, we can still add to it later. But now, after preparing so much all at once, it won't be suitable after a while. Throwing it away wouldn't be worth it! We just need a fully sweet and happy family organization. Chen ge said. So, you'll never change your heart? I probe, also feeling uneasy! I only love you. Chen ge looks at your face, and he feels happy! I don't know what it means to change your heart?</p>
<p>Truly, he is all heart! Just like me, he is honest and doesn't lie. And he keeps his whole sincere heart! Naturally, he is a child! A child would never lie in front of his beloved. I like him, and I love him even more! Occasionally, we meet. We talk about the decoration and furnishings of the home and the furniture to be used in the rooms. He advocates using cream-colored wooden furniture. But I prefer everything to be painted white! Clean and beautiful.</p>
<p>The result of the discussion is that he wins, the reason being: White is too monotonous; cream color doesn't feel monotonous in its cleanliness and is still so beautiful and good-looking! That's how he smiles! Because he has won! Otherwise, he pouts his lips, which is so cute! Like a naughty child who can't get his favorite candy and is equally dissatisfied!</p>
<p>I said, our income and expenditure must have a fixed budget; we can't spend beyond our income! In particular, we should set aside a considerable portion to prepare for our children's education fund. In addition, we also need appropriate entertainment to relieve the fatigue of everyday life! Appropriately, every week in the morning, strolling through the park, the quiet scenery will influence a good mood! In the afternoon, we should enjoy ourselves as much as possible, watching movies, or staying at home, singing songs, and listening to songs, which are all the best forms of entertainment!</p>
<p>Chen ge promised me. To buy a large piano and a wireless radio. I happily hugged his face and kissed him! He laughed. Saying that I am an innocent child, even more lovable than his own younger sister.</p>
<p>Later, I said that I wanted to learn to play the harmonica. It's a great instrument, and I must learn it! Ah, but he wouldn't allow it! Because with my not-so-strong body, it's easy to damage the rapidly expanding part of my lungs!</p>
<p>So, I didn't play the harmonica, and I only played the piano every day. Sometimes, my fingers swelled up and felt numb! But I still couldn't change that excited habit.</p>
<p>But these days, I haven't been playing as often. I'm busy with another reason, of course I know it myself, and others can guess it! Yesterday, Sister Hui asked me. Why I wasn't in the mood to play the piano anymore! Could it be that Chen ge wouldn't let me play it because my hands were so swollen! But! Feeling embarrassed to answer, I just gave her a red face! The days are getting closer and closer, and my heart is beating even harder. Happy anticipation? Shy coquettishness? I can't describe it anymore!</p>
<h3 id="e283">On Unemployed Intellectuals <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Every spring and autumn when schools start, I often see advertisements in the classifieds for teachers, with salaries of two hundred dollars offered for foreign-returned professors, of course, there are some, but advertisements for elementary or middle school teachers with "half-paid volunteer" positions and "own board and lodging" for a measly ten or fifteen dollars for "transportation fees" are everywhere. Also, according to friends I know, there are even some who teach arithmetic and English for twenty dollars a month, teaching more than fourteen hours a week. In addition, the salaries of teachers in many private middle schools are mostly fifty or seventy cents per hour, at most one dollar. If a "boss" starts a middle school and hires teachers for one dollar and twenty cents per hour, many intellectuals on the brink of starvation simply "worry only about not being able to snatch the opportunity"! I also saw an introduction to "maids seeking employment" in the Women's Voice bi-monthly, where "Aunt Chen" was asking for a monthly wage of seven or eight dollars.</p>
<p>The most prevalent and cruel facts above, at least show that the panic of the "unemployed intellectuals" has reached its peak, and many are seeking "special bargains" but cannot find employers; secondly, there are a group of "enthusiastic education" private school bosses who take the exploitation of the brains and sweat of poor teachers as their "lifestyle"; thirdly, the salaries for teachers in many small schools are no better than hiring an old nanny in a second or third-class mansion.</p>
<p>The large number of unemployed intellectuals filling society is naturally the inevitable result of social depression and universal bankruptcy. Under the modality of the era, where there is no order, even though there is "One person becomes Buddha, even his pets ascend to heaven," there is a general depression from the city to the village,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>the tide pushes the original intellectuals out of the gates of institutions, schools, shops, and companies. And for those "new intellectuals" with university or high school diplomas to get a foothold is obviously impossible.</p>
<p>The accumulation of old and new unemployed intellectuals has almost formed a "mountain of people" shoulder to shoulder, this mountain decorates the major cities, becoming an alarming social tumor. Where are these many unemployed intellectuals going? Naturally, there are only two roads: progress and regression. They cannot linger on the crossroads forever, and there is no "middle way" that is neither biased nor deviated.</p>
<p>Those who are willing to move forward should grasp the true trends of the world and China, and find a way out of the struggle for national independence and the welfare of the people. In terms of personal life, in addition to finding ways to solve the employment problem, they must also strive to politicize their lives. Those who are willing to regress, the problem is even simpler. Take off the "noble" coat, and honestly be a henchman of the old social forces. Even if one cannot become famous, at least one will be a specimen in the dog's pedigree for thousands of years. In short, unemployed intellectuals should not continue to be pessimistic and sigh, nor should they linger in the middle. They should strive for employment on the one hand, and recognize where they are going in the future. Standing on the stage of the war of dragons and tigers and fantasizing about neutrality is the stupidest thing to do and is bound to be "attacked from both sides"!</p>
<h3 id="e284">A Blind Talk on the Guide to Seeking Officialdom <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>One day a guest came and described the poor and ugly state of the "disaster officials" waiting for work in Nanjing, which made everyone laugh. However, one couldn't help but sigh and say, "The ups and downs of officialdom have existed since ancient times, but I didn't expect them to be even more severe today!" The guest said, "Do you know how many disaster officials are waiting for work in Nanjing? More than eighteen thousand! Some live in small hotels, some live in the homes of friends and relatives. Only God knows how poor and painful their lives are! However, no matter how poor their lives are, they still have to pay attention to their clothes. Those who wear Zhongshan suits or military uniforms are still the same, but those who wear long robes must have a mandarin jacket, and those who wear Western suits must have an overcoat. Clothes are the appearance of a person, and they must pay attention to them. Moreover, this society only values clothes and not people, isn't that right? They ask friends and relatives to write letters of recommendation every day, and they take the letters of recommendation to see the people they want to see, begging for cultivation and promotion with humble and respectful attitudes. But what is the result, do you know? The important people in Nanjing treat the words 'request for cultivation and promotion' like the wind in their ears, blowing in from the left ear and running out from the right ear, not paying any attention to them at all. Moreover, they are tired of hearing them. Who would want to find a place for this group of disaster officials to eat? As a result, the person you ask for cultivation and promotion gives you a letter of recommendation and asks you to find someone else to cultivate and promote you. You get a letter of recommendation from such an important person, thinking that with his recommendation, the job will definitely be no problem, but that is a piece of waste paper and has no effect at all. Hahaha, you take this important person's letter of recommendation to find that important person for 'cultivation and promotion', and that important person is also a person who is used to issuing letters of recommendation asking people to find another important person for 'cultivation and promotion'. In this way, your letter of recommendation is just a joke to him. "Could it be that this important person's face has completely lost its effect on that important person and they both know it tacitly?" Someone in the audience asked suspiciously. The guest said, "That's right. They are all people who are used to issuing letters of recommendation. When they meet, they don't even bother to mention it. Who ever thought that it was a matter of losing their own face? Poor these eighteen thousand disaster officials, they are still kept in the dark. As soon as the letter of recommendation is sent, their hearts are filled with hope and they happily wait for news at home for ten days or so. After you visit three or two times to inquire, at first you only hear some perfunctory words, and later they even refuse to see you. The doorman often sees you, a disaster official who brings a letter of recommendation to visit his master, and the kind of contemptuous face he gives you is unbearable. You, who have been ordered by the master to refuse to meet you, are like a beggar begging for food from his doorman at that time, and there is no place to complain about the humiliation." "Then, is it impossible to seek employment in Nanjing?" Someone in the audience asked again. The guest said, "That's not entirely true. First, you must have capital, and second, you must put on airs." "Seeking employment also requires capital, then why would people with capital seek employment?" The guest said, "So you are an amateur. Having capital is very useful. Sending gifts requires money, this is one point. Secondly, using money to treat guests to a big meal is the only way to build a relationship. Once you have a relationship, it will be easy to handle. For those who ask for things to be done, after sending gifts and treating them to a meal, your impression will be in his mind, and it will not be difficult to find a job later. However, you must not mention the words 'cultivation and promotion' when sending gifts and treating them to a meal, otherwise it will be over, and he will hate you." "Is this what you call putting on airs?" The guest said, "This is a way to approach him, it is not putting on airs yet. What is meant by putting on airs is that when you meet, you must absolutely put on an expression and attitude of just coming to Nanjing to have fun, so that he has no doubts. And at the same time, you must also show that you don't care about finding a job, that is, you have contact with all parties in the world, and you don't want to find a job. This is putting on airs. Moreover, you must also be able to brag, with a thorough understanding of international situations, domestic politics, Mussolini, Hitler, and even the knowledge of ancient poetry, Song lyrics, novels, and dramas, bragging for a long time and making people admire your erudition, this is enough qualification." "What are the next steps after these steps are done?" The guest said, "Then you proceed to find a job. But you must never mention it in person, it will also be ruined if you mention it yourself, you must entrust a friend to praise you to the skies by his side, let him say it, and it will be done." The guest's words can truly be used as a guide to seeking officialdom. However, the way to seek officialdom is also difficult!</p>
<h3 id="e285">"Year" and "Week" <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Recently, it seems very difficult to live life. One must come up with many methods and set many topics in order to pass the days. This situation did not exist in the past. Outwardly, there were also times in the past when the reign title was changed, or the reign title was named "He Ping," or the reign title was named "Jia He," similar to the current "National Goods Year," "Children's Year," etc., but in essence, they were quite different.</p>
<p>In the past, it was not that the reign title of "He Ping" was set first, and then steps were taken to achieve peace, or that the topic of "Jia He" was proposed, and then steps were taken to produce rice with two, three, or even five or six ears, but rather "a celebration after the fact"! But recently, this is not possible. Recently, it is like writing an essay, where the topic is set first, and then the year is lived.</p>
<p>Although "another year easily passes with autumn wind," the days still pass the same - the suffering still suffer, and the rampant still run rampant. However, the general public needs stimulation. It is necessary to add "what year" or "what week" to ordinary days in order to create temporary excitement. This shows that people's hearts have become unusually tired and can no longer tolerate an ordinary life. However, pursuing what one hopes for in this way is also a wrong path, and one will fall into greater fatigue and a more boring situation, and there will never be a day of "getting what one wants." Russell once said, "Stimulating things, like drugs, the more you have, the more you need." We only need to look at last year's so-called "National Goods Year," and the total import surplus for the whole year reached more than 41.784 million yuan to know. How do people generally feel about "years" or "weeks" that are prepared with great enthusiasm? People's hearts have long since moved from "fatigue" to "numbness," and cannot be stirred up by general slogans - whether stimulation can be effective also has its objective conditions, and the stimulation method we are currently using is like smoking opium, hoping to be excited for a while, or anesthetized for a while!</p>

<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Ke Jia seemed to sense that Bai E's behavior was unusual. He moved his gaze to the desk, where a can of cigarettes was placed neatly. "Brother, are you smoking again?" It wasn't intentionally meant to be the beginning of loneliness. An uncultivated athlete cannot reveal his emotions with facial expressions. What he knows is being honest and impolite, especially towards Zhu Xiaosun, whom he calls his little brother. He believes that his orders should be questioned unless they are revoked. "Smoking? I can even drink!" The corners of his mouth twitched nervously, coldly like a hidden weapon. Ke Jia smiled, unnaturally. "Brother, did you see my note?" He rubbed his hands together, as if hoping to elicit the answer from the other person with this gesture.</p>
<p>He nodded, not answering. "Where exactly did you stay for two days?" He leaned forward, as if preparing for the 50-meter final race with his hands close to the floor. "On the mountain!" "The doctor said so." "It was my own idea!" He took the last puff of smoke so elegantly, throwing the cigarette butt out the window with a practiced technique. Then the hand that pulled back extracted two cigarettes from the cigarette can, gave one to Ke Jia, and said with a slight smile, "Let's smoke cigarettes." This was equivalent to the honesty and impoliteness of a wild bull. Telling you that you can smoke here, but you can't talk. The white smoke drifted out the window with the gentle breeze, lightly. A long period of silence occupied the space of March.</p>
<p>Like a rejected athlete on the playing field, Ke Jia stood up and said, "You're definitely not going to Shanghai?" "Why wouldn't I go to Shanghai?" A smile. A frown. "After your wedding, I will go to Shanghai myself." "What does that mean?" He said, unconsciously sitting down. "Am I going to ask you again if being lovelorn is painful?" He smiled beautifully. But then he tightened his face. "I don't want to see Qin Bo again." The wild bull, who had been guessing the riddle for a long time, finally couldn't help but laugh. "Brother, don't be childish. The day before yesterday, Jing Yi..." Ke thought for a moment, and then continued, "It was the day before yesterday that she visited Qin Bo and asked her to be the bridesmaid. She immediately agreed. She also asked if you could come back from Hangzhou. Brother, love is just a game to embellish life. If Qin Bo marries, you can play another one. Is a man's capacity really so narrow?" He spoke every word with great force, showing that he was an athlete. Xiaosun brushed his naturally curly hair and suddenly jumped up from the desk chair. A white goose swimming leisurely in a clear stream, he did not admit that his capacity was inferior to that of a woman. "Enough talk! When are you leaving?" "Tomorrow." "Let's go together!" His naturally curly hair swayed in the spring breeze of March.</p>

<p>— Translated by Shu Yin</p>
<p>1922 was a crucial year!</p>
<p>My connection with the revolution became a kind of inner confidence, of blood and bone. In my creative process, I transitioned from the rational, almost abstract, and eccentric "The Sage" (adapted from Ostrovsky's comedy) to the propagandistic and inflammatory street dramas "Hear Moscow" and "Gas Masks," and finally to the revolutionary film "Potemkin."</p>
<p>The tendency to gradually approach the revolution made art more deeply imbued with the elements of militant materialism.</p>
<p>Continuing to make films and meet the demands of society, I continued to take on the task of developing a "method" to create cinematic expressions, striving to instill effective revolutionary art and arm the young people engaged in film work during the first Five-Year Plan. Recent central works like "Ten Days That Shook the World" were intended for experimentation and research.</p>
<p>My personal work currently takes completely consistent steps with the scientific and educational experimental methods planned by the State Institute of Cinematography. Theoretical writings are based on the fundamental principles of film art. I have created my life philosophy, which is entirely based on the interests of the revolution, because the revolution determines everything.</p>
<p>The question here is to what extent the development of consciousness can reach, and the will is unyielding. When I reached such a stage, I decided to travel abroad. Abroad—is a final test for the biography of a citizen who grew up in the Soviet society of the October Revolution. This is a test of free choice. Abroad—is a final test for the "masters of culture" to consciously distinguish friends from enemies. Abroad—is a final test for creators to know whether they can create revolution alone and survive outside the revolution. This test took place in front of the gold mine of Hollywood. The means of wanting to reject human charm and grace with a non-heroic posture were rejected. They were working for the benefit of another class under different social circumstances. It is impossible to create outside this class division. The full power and ability of the revolution has risen. The pressure of the proletarian revolution sweeps away all resistance in its path and pulls in forces that once tended towards it, grasping them even more strongly. That is what every Soviet artist does and thinks. Many of us come from the revolution. All of us participate in the revolution with the weapons of art. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e288">Review of "Cradle Song" <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Cradle Song</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures · Grand Theater Premiere</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Since "The Woman" shook the film industry, in addition to the ideological system of the director, Ms. Stone, radiating a rare brilliance in the European and American film circles, the protagonist, Dolores del Río, also received deep attention and was immediately hired by Paramount from Germany to America.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Now, after watching this film, we cannot help but immediately recall "The Woman." This is not only due to the relationship of the leading actor, but also the arrangement of the story is quite similar. "The Woman," as everyone knows, declares the freedom of human nature. For freedom, for love between people, those "uniformed virgins" are unwilling to endure suffering and instinctively resist oppressors. Their spirit of fighting for freedom and justice has undoubtedly given some degree of stimulation to those who are uneasy with reality.</p>
<p>So, what does "Cradle Song" tell us? Religion, the ruler of the spirit, has ruined the youth of countless young girls. They are anesthetized in that illusory so-called "universal love" of holy light, and from the desolate world, they move towards the hell of heaven. There, although they have been baptized by God, they still cannot forget the people outside the convent, their homes, their siblings, and all the people who care about them. Although they try their best to endure the cold and cruel trampling and destruction of God, they also cannot forget the existence of love between people. Therefore, they issued a weak call for liberation from the depths of their hearts, and thus Teeresa, who was raised by Joana, finally escaped from that cold convent in the exchange of their sorrows and joys. The profound depiction of human feelings, the mournful cry of the weak religious prisoners. Obviously, this does not have the passion of "The Woman," but the tone is very similar to "The Woman." The former is active, while the latter is the opposite. This further proves the greatness of Ms. Stone.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In addition, what should be especially mentioned is the attitude of the author of "Cradle Song." On the one hand, he has an irrational expression against religion, but he never attacks the existence of monasteries. He completely uses his doctrine of the mean to promote the common sense of human feelings. As for letting the female lead leave the convent and then the scope of being a good wife and loving mother, that is certainly something we are overly demanding that he cannot understand. Therefore, in American movies, it is already worth paying attention to having such a rational work. As for this film, it is entirely for Dolores del Río's personality and style, which is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<h3 id="e289">"The Broadway Melody" <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>For years, the most outstanding song and dance film is the Lianhua production. The scenery is novel, the scale is grand, and talented people gather. Over fifty Broadway stars are recruited to participate. The songs and dances and the plot are both superb. It will be premiered in Nanjing soon.</p>
<p>This film is always a good work. Not only is the story as mentioned above, but the director's technique is also worth praising. But here, I don't want to point out every single detail. What must be said is its main feature.</p>
<p>After watching it, stories of this type are often easy to become boring, but here, emotions are moved in a quiet atmosphere. Whether it is the effect of sound, or the melody of the play, or even the composition of each written surface, they are extremely perfect. In terms of art itself, it once again confirms the great true value of film. The acting is good, and this should be praised by everyone. I don't want to comment on the skills of each actor here, anyway, they have all tried their best to achieve extremely high results. However, Dolores del Río seems to be developing only within this typical personality, and it always feels somewhat narrow.</p>
<h3 id="e290">After Seeing "Cradle Song" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Bai</p>
<p>(1) Spring in Winter</p>
<p>After "January 28th", in such cold winter weather, coupled with my own chaotic emotions, I feel extremely cold... "Cradle Song" gave me some kind air. It can also be said to be a momentary spring in winter... (2) There is no golden feature here.</p>
<p>Eroticism, wild dancing, women's legs, "mmm..." These are the characteristics of general American films, which is like the afterglow of the setting sun, a general beauty. But there is nothing in this film, there is only the tears of human feelings...</p>
<p>(3) A Few Points Worth Remembering.</p>
<p>That same-tone Follow Shot; the melody that connects the scenes between the screens with music; the pyramid-shaped "Bust" composition that represents sublimity; the combination of these made the depths of my eyes feel slightly moist. Note one a, on the cold and lonely picture of Joana kneeling in front of the Virgin Mary statue, the music is the tone of an external Spanish hot dance. b· When Joana is standing alone by the wall, the music is the cheers of children outside... These inverse comparisons of sound and picture are worth remembering. Note 2: All of Joana's half-length shots use pyramid-shaped compositions.</p>
<h3 id="e291">"Fiery Youth" Premieres at the Carlton <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company recently produced "Fiery Youth," directed by Tang Jie, starring Wang Yuanlong and Ye Qiuxin, with Zhang Zhenduo, Ma Dongwu, Xiao Zhengzhong, Shao Gang, and others in supporting roles. Wang Yuanlong has always been known as the Silver Screen Overlord, and Ye Qiuxin is a rising star, praised as a model of beauty. The two collaborated for the first time, and the results were very satisfactory. The film depicts the despicable tricks of unscrupulous merchants and the spirit of patriotic youth who are not threatened by coercion or enticed by profit. The whole play is enthusiastic and intense, enough to arouse the sympathy of the audience. It has been decided that the film will be publicly screened at the Carlton Grand Theatre starting on January 31.</p>

<p>— Long Geng</p>
<p>"Dad! I have some too!" The son in the corner shouted. He had a piggy bank full of money. That's how their cloth shop opened! The shop's name was "Xie Xing." Kejian's father was the manager, Kejian greeted customers at the shop, Kejian's mother wrapped the cloth, Kejian's wife and sister turned the cloth over for the customers to see, and the little son Shixiong passed the cloth and invoices. This family store was too enviable! The Xie Xing cloth shop was full of vitality, and many customers patronized it one after another. However, unfortunately, this thriving Xie Xing was seen by that cunning monkey-like Diaoren. He was jealous, and he even remembered the past. Therefore, he wanted to give Kejian a serious revenge. Immediately, Diaoren hurriedly ran back and reported everything to Hao Xin. After considerable consideration by the two of them, their method emerged. They opened a Da Xing cloth shop directly across from Xie Xing. The entrance of Da Xing was surrounded by large red and purple colorful cloths, and Connaught also played loudly at the entrance. The large golden characters at the entrance told people that they were having a 30% off sale. Under the banner of this 30% off sale, crowds of customers surged like a tide, bustling. But, what about Xie Xing on the other side? Kejian's father and son were surrounded by a melancholy atmosphere. They glared angrily at the lively and prosperous scene across the street, and were silently stunned. "Selling at 30% off will lose 15% of the cost, how can we do it? But if we don't, we won't even have money to eat, what can we do? We can only temporarily follow them." So, Xie Xing also sold at 30% off. But Da Xing sold even cheaper at 50% off. Kejian's father was extremely embarrassed, and Kejian could only sigh a long sigh. But, at the same time, debt collectors were roaring in their store, so Kejian's father's heart was broken. Under multiple squeezes, Kejian's father fell ill. At the same time, a transfer advertisement was posted at the entrance of Xie Xing. Diaoren saw the transfer advertisement and showed a victorious smile. He walked into the store and asked Kejian: "Is the store really going to be transferred?" Kejian was lost in thought, revealing a mysterious expression of dissatisfaction. "How much is the stock worth?" On the one hand, he still asked with a treacherous smile. But, on the one hand, he still ignored him. "How much do you want for the transfer?" Diaoren asked again. "Including everything, just 1,000 yuan is fine." Kejian said with an angry tone. So, Diaoren retreated with a treacherous smile. But, Kejian's wife next to him couldn't bear it anymore. She said: "It's rare for someone to come and inquire, but you ask for such a high price that you scare people away all at once." Kejian said angrily, "If they run, they run. I originally didn't want to transfer it to him." "He, people don't get along with you, but money has no grudge against you! Don't you know that the family urgently needs money?" (To be continued)</p>
