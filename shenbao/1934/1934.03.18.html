<h3 id="c40">救濟銀價問題之批判英 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>自美國羅斯福政府治下之議會。白銀派鼓吹銀價抬高政策以來。在以銀爲貨幣本位之中國。一部分社會輿論。遂以爲美國之政策發生變化。其所影響必與中國之利害居於絶對相反之地位。於倫敦八國銀恊定之批准則旣有贊否兩派兩於救濟銀價影響方案。尤有議論紛紜之情勢一若銀價之升。</p>
<p>降。不啻爲全般問題癥結所繫惟以吾人觀之。則此種紛紜殊未足謂爲對於吾國今日之白銀問題。有基本上之認識也。</p>
<p>夫白銀之爲物。在美國及其他相似之國家視之。僅爲與市面一般貨物相同。惟吾國則以是爲國民一切財富價值之凖繩。其價格在國外方面之漲跌如何。一方面固足以影響我國銀元之匯價。或其物價。他方面尤可以使社會各階層對於銀價變動之利害。發生不同之觀點。彼美國羅斯福政府於銀價久經慘落之際。突以人爲之方法。使之提高。其足以有損於我國社會擾亂我國金融固何待煩言。我國今日輿論界。欲於安定社會與繁榮商業的觀點下。主張以穩定世界銀市爲前提。甚或以達到吾國貨幣對外匯價之安定爲目的。此亦爲目前之最高鐵則。惟問題之中心。則尙另有所在焉。卽第一中國現時之金融組織。是否能於一定計劃之下。執行穩定對外匯價之目的。第二以中央現時之財政狀態。是否足以担任穩定匯價之責任。如曰皆不可能則在此美國操縱白銀市價之時吾國徒爲化人之魚肉。居於絶對被動之地位而已。若於此種情形之下。高談銀價之如何救濟。甚且以銀價之影響足以發生絶對利害。夫豈探原之論哉。</p>
<p>試就往事觀之。當一九二九年銀價初落之際國人莫不以銀之過跌爲患。今銀價行將上漲。則又莫不以爲懼。得失之間。未能洞見中心權力之何如。尤未能認識現時金副組織之狀况。因此喜懼之際。毫無標凖可言。原夫白銀價</p>
<p>格之變動。於我利害之孰多孰少。實無絶對標凖。當銀之由賤而貴也。本國産業資本。固受相當之壓迫。彼恃金幣收入以爲生活之資者。亦未嘗不感受相當之損失。（假設銀之貴爲對金而言。）然同時外貨旣賤。消費者之担負減輕。倘能利用以爲發展國家建設事業。又未嘗不足以冲消銀貴之害。外債本息之减輕猶其餘事也。反是當銀之由貴而賤也。雖覺建設不易。外債日重。然産業則可由是以資發展。利害本無絶對可分。由是以言。當銀價貴賤不定之時。貴在政府與人民能施行一定之政策。否則銀之貴賤均足以貽國家無窮之憂。向之不能於一九二九年以後銀賤之時。積極發展人民之産業。亦猶今後未必於銀貴之時有所作爲耳。然則此一定之政策唯何。曰中央財政之穩定。與金融組織之强化。二者是已。明乎此然後可以論銀價之影響焉。</p>

<p>西康通訊、康藏形勢、突趨嚴重、頃據前方消息、藏軍係於舊曆除夕夜、（二月十三）利用大金寺僧兵爲前鋒、繞道偷渡金沙江、與我守軍相持兩日、見我方兵力單薄、勢難支持、乃於二月十五日拂曉、增加大部兵力、猛撲金沙江東岸之鄧科縣城、隔斷鄧科德格間之交通、鄧科城僅駐軍一連、因衆寡不敵、當卽退出、藏軍遂入駐城内、川康軍步二旅旅長鄧讓得報、乃飛調張我戎團長馳往增援、十六日、雙方在鄧科德格間之某要隘、正式接觸、藏兵不支、乃向鄧科撤退、我軍當日卽抵鄧科城附近、十七日、乃將鄧科克復、雙方肉搏衝鋒、激烈異常、結果、由我軍將原有陣地、次第奪回、藏軍及大金寺僧兵、狼狽退往觀音寺集中、此役雙方死亡均大、此十七日午刻事也、觀音寺地形險要、藏軍在該處據碉死守、我軍初選敢死隊衝鋒、以手溜彈擲放、無如碉堡堅固、易守難攻、相持至數日之久、僅傷敵軍百餘人、未能將觀音寺正式克復、嗣由張國飛調迫擊砲山砲各一連、兼程前往助攻、想日内必能攻下也、因觀音寺孤立金沙江西岸、觀音寺一日未能攻下、則鄧科一日未能攻下、同時德格方面、自十七日起、雙方亦正式接觸、藏軍以機砲掩護大批皮船、企圖强渡過河、幸我方在東岸早建有堅固工事、藏軍來攻、卽沉着應戰、擊沉皮船多隻、藏方終未得逞、惟藏軍犯康、凖備已久、今旣正式發動、彼衆我寡、我方雖得一時勝利、前途尙不能定、嗣由唐英·鄧讓·聯名、電請川康邊防總指揮劉文輝、從速增兵應援、劉得電後、已於二十三日電各方報告、并於二十五日發出通電、除瀝陳前方戰况外、略謂敵軍悍然啓釁、戰事横延、文輝職責所在、自當奮力應戰、以固邊防、惟事實糧欵、在平時已極感困難、當此軍事時期、斷非貧瘠之區所能勝任、望迅予統籌撥濟、俾免隕越云云、聞蒙藏委員長石青陽、已有電到雅安、仍囑劉竭力避免軍事行動、仍主張和平解决、不過藏軍犯康、旣具决心、且有某帝國主義者之嗾使、現在雙方業以兵戎相見、如欲化干戈爲玉帛、當然不能不有以滿足其慾望也、</p>
<p>至藏方目的何在、可於最近之矮達會議見之、先是藏方駐昌都之噶倫眞冬、前派其恊敎偕同翻譯蔡加容入康、旣又轉赴雅安、晉謁劉文輝、聲言藏方達賴新喪、司倫葛厦繼續主持政敎大權、現决擁護中央、共同防備外力之壓迫、年來藏康糾紛發生、漢藏關係、亦受其相當影響、現决對康讓步、已派熟悉康藏情形之瓊讓代表前赴矮達、與川康軍代表交涉、同時拉薩三大寺、亦各派代表、參預其事、請求劉氏另派代表前往、其時劉氏適因藏方凖備内犯日亟、派康藏交涉員兼德格知事姜郁文、由德格啓程、渡江前赴矮達、吊唁達賴、並窺探藏軍虚實、當姜氏抵矮達後、瓊讓代表及三大寺代表、亦相繼前往、姜與瓊讓、同爲過去康藏和戰恊定之訂立者、不圖此次見面、瓊讓竟板起面孔、將康藏和約、完全推翻、雙方於二月八日正式會議、瓊讓當時乃提出下列四項條件、較前次藏方迭次要求、尤爲苛刻、其條件如次、（一）德格·（包刮鄧科·石渠白玉等縣）甘孜·曕化·朱倭·（鑪霍縣屬之一村）及康南之鹽井、與巴安縣屬河西各村之地、須完全交由藏方管轄、（二）去歲康藏雙方在岡拖訂立之停戰和約、應作無效、川康軍不得再行援引、（三）大金寺僧、自去歲退過金沙江西岸、飄泊無依、川康軍現應無條件容其返寺、不得故意阻攔、（四）川康軍如不容納大金寺僧返寺、則彼等採取自由行動、藏方不能負責、當由姜氏據理駁復、略謂德格甘瞻及巴安河西各地、係西康屬地、川康軍當局、無權自由割讓、如中央明令飭讓與藏方、自當遵照辦理、如未得中央同意、凡屬西康土地、川康軍不能以尺寸讓人、藏方如有此要求、可逕向中央提出、岡拖和約、係由康藏雙方代表所商定、復經中央批准、現當共同遵守、如另訂新約、亦當以此爲標凖、何能一旦推翻、大金寺僧連年肇亂、康藏雙方之兵連禍結、歷於今日、該寺亦難逃其咎、去歲爲川康軍驅逐出境、亦係罪有應得、川康軍旣不究旣往、准其返寺、已屬寬大爲懷、至至於限定其不得携帶槍械入境、亦係當局懲前毖後應有之處置、如藏軍暗助彼等肇亂、其責任當由藏軍負之、雙方於八·九·十·三日、作長時期之辯論、迄無具體結果、藏方並擬將姜氏扣留、後由三大寺代表從中緩頰、始决定由雙方代表、各向主管長官請示、姜氏甫返德格、而康藏戰事、突然發生、恐一時不易解决也、（中聯社）</p>

<p>—蔣在總理逝世紀念席上演辭—</p>
<p>南昌通訊、贛省黨部於十二日上午十時、召集各界在大禮堂門首花園内、舉行總理逝世九週年紀念大會、到有蔣委員長張學良丁超五熊式輝楊永泰賀國光曁省黨部省政府各委員·與各界代表、共約六百餘人、全體圍立成一圓形、由蔣領導行紀念儀式後、當卽致詞、並講述關於孫總理生平之根本思想與革命人格、全體佇立靜聽、空氣嚴肅、直至十二時許、始奏樂攝影散會、茲將蔣之演詞紀錄如下、</p>
<p>「各位同志、今天是我們總理逝世紀念日、九年以前的今天、就在這個時候、我們總理在北平逝世、我們現在來紀念總理逝世、應當記得總理最後的呼聲、和平奮鬥救中國、這就是總理告訴我們、我們要打倒帝國主義、完成國民革命來救中國、一定要以和平的方法、大家團結精神共同一致來爲國犧牲、奮鬭到底、我們今天回想到總理最後所講的「和平奮鬥救中國」這一句話、一方面可以曉得當時革命的環境、和總理艱難奮鬭的情形、一方面從此可以認識總理偉大的革命人格、其次、在總理逝世以前幾個星期、戴季陶先生曾經請問總理、究竟總理的革命主義之哲學的基礎何在、同是戴先生將他自己關於這個問題研究的心得、報告總理、他講完之後、總理說、「你的意思對了、我的革命哲學、就是民生哲學、」就在這一次、總理將他的革命哲學很扼要的有系統的、交給我們了、隨後戴先生將他自己研究的心得、根據總理的意義、寫了一本孫文主義之哲學的基礎、並且特别列了一個民生哲學系統表、附加說明、以爲全書的結論、今天我們在此地紀念總理、個個人應當篤信總理的革命主義體認總理偉大的革命人格、眞眞實實做一個總理的信徒、要能如此、一定要對於總理革命思想之淵源所自、卽總理整個革命人格、和事業基植所在、先能認識明白、因此、我今天要將民生哲學的道理就民生哲學系統表說明所載、來和我們在南昌的各位同志講一講、</p>
<p>原說明云、研究孫中山主義的人、應該先要知道九件事、第一「先生的基本思想、完全淵源於中國正統思想的中庸之道先生實在是孔子以後、中國道德文化上繼往開來的大聖」、這第一件事、就是講要認識總理思想之淵源及中國文化道德史上之最大最高的地位、指明總理乃繼承中國正統思想之現代的大聖、</p>
<p>第二「先生的智識、包含近代最新的科學、而其解决一切問題、必用近代的科學方法、」這第二件、是講總理的思想和學問、就思想的淵源而言、固然是繼承中國歷來的正統思想、卽孔孟以來的中庸之道、但就學問的範圍、尤其是解决一切實際問題之方法而言、實是包括近代最新的科學、此所以成其爲現代最大的聖人、我們曉得、如果一個人僅知古人的中庸之道、而不懂最新的科學、不能用科學的方法來解决一切實際問題、那就是書獃子、我們總理的基本思想和學問、實在是縱貫古今、廣包中外、由此而結晶爲其革命的主義、發而爲革命的事業、</p>
<p>第三「先生的三民主義原理、全部包括在民生主義之内、其全部著作、可總名之曰民生哲學」、這第三件事、是指明三民主義以民生主義爲中心、總理一切著述、可以民生哲學總括、總理曾經說、「民生是歷史的中心」、這句話就是總理研究歷史的最後結論、也就是民生哲學一條基本定理、革命主義、原來就是以人力順應同時支配歷史的最高原則、民生旣爲歷史的中心、民生哲學、是革命思想的基礎、我們要認識總理思想的根本體系、就不可不對於民生哲學特别注意研究、</p>
<p>第四、「先生一生努力、全在以革命的乎段、救國救民、打破一切個人主義的迷夢、實現三民主義、」這是說總理一生的努力、就是以革命的乎段來救國家救民族、總理的革命乎段、在什麽地方呢、就是要打破一切個人主義的迷夢、卽一切自</p>
<p>私自利的企圖、因爲自私自利的個人主義、是危害整個國家和民族的、我們要救國家和民族、必先澈底剷除這種思想和行動、然後方可實現總理的三民主義、以救國救民、</p>
<p>第一、「三民主義之原始的目的、在於恢復民族的自信力、因爲民族的自信力、不能恢復、則此弱而且大之古文化民族、其老衰病不可救、一切新活動俱無從生、卽發生亦不脫病裏的狀態、不能救民族的危亡、」這一段話、是講三民主義的根本目的、是要喚醒民衆、恢復一般國民對於自己民族的自信力、曉得我們中華民族不僅具備自强獨立的民族精神、而且富有創造發明的優越智能、更有和平中正至高至大的固有德性、我們有五千年光榮的歷史、和高美的文化、實在是一個最古的文明國家和優秀民族、我們無論到什麽時候、無論如何危急、只要我們能恢復固有的民族精神和智能、一定可以發揚我們民族光榮的歷史、建設我們眞正獨立自由的新國家、開拓我們整個民族文明悠久的新生命、無論如何、我們不能受帝國主義的壓迫侵略、尤其是不好自暴自棄、將我們祖宗所遺留下來偉大精神和光榮的歷史忘掉、我們要時時記得我們的祖宗是如何的偉大、我們的國家、向來是如何强盛、以前我們的祖宗所能做到的事、現在我們難道做不到嗎、我們個個人要有此自信、曉得我們中華民族、是不好隨使欺侮的、現在人家來欺我們、我們不必害怕、一定要恢復民族固有的精神德性和智能、來打倒帝國主義建設一個光華燦爛的中華民國出來、</p>
<p>第六、「三民主義實行的方法在以全民族的共同的努力、完成國民革命集中國民革命之努力、以國家資本主義爲建設民國之基礎、」這一條是講三民主義實行的方法、第一步要喚起民衆、使全民族能團結一致、共同努力革命、第二步完成國民革命、在此處卽指以革命之力量、統一國家、第三步再集中全國民衆與革命黨的力量、以國家資本主義爲目標、而努力建設、以奠定國家萬年不拔的基礎、</p>
<p>第七、「三民主義之終結目的、在對治全世界的由資本主義而發生之社會病、以全人類之共同努力、建設新共産社會、完成眞正民有·民治·民享·的大同世界、就是要造成均無貧、和無寡、安無傾的世界、」　一條是講三民主義由中國逐步實行的方法、　一條是講三民主義最後的目的、在消極的、對全世界由資本主義而發生的社會病、積極的造　一個「爲民所有·爲民所治·爲民所享·」的理　　大同世界、現在資本社會主義所發生的毛　　　之多、最大一點、就是貧富的懸殊、窮的窮得没有飯吃、富的富得不得了、三民主義、就是對症下藥、要救治資本主義一切社會病、而達到民有民治民享的目的、這種以世界爲範疇的大改革、需要全人類共同努力、由全人類的共同努力、就可建設出一個全世界的共産社會、卽所謂大同世界、所以三民主義乃是眞正使人人有衣穿有飯吃的共産主義、不是現在一般打家刦舍殺人放火的騙人的假共産主義、（未完）</p>

<p>再談關於文</p>
<p>學學習步驟</p>
<p>寫作及其他（三）</p>
<p>以上已將學習文學所提出的三個命題，先討論了··（一）什麽是我們所需要的文學；及（二）怎樣讀文藝作品、今日我們接續討論，（三）怎樣創作？我們希望讀者還參看以前我們發表的幾篇論文學的文字。編者</p>
<p>（三）怎樣創作？人類是有發表欲的，研究文學者之想創作，乃是一種自然的要求。</p>
<p>不過，一般人對於創作的態度，有着兩種相反的而同樣錯誤的觀念，這兩種觀念，最易阻礙創作力的發展，必須立卽加以糾正。</p>
<p>一·怕創作。有些人把創作看成很神秘，看成非普通人所能企望的東西。這是不對的。我們之所以這樣看，是因爲我們把創作看成完全是技術的問題，只是那些讀書數二年，富有文學修養的文人雅士的專利品。技術是要的，但技術不是創作的主要條件，主要的是内容。技術是會隨着你的創作生活的進步而進步的。挨了打的孩子要「哭」，受了委曲的人要「漢氣」，碼頭工人在般運時要哼着「咳喲」，咳喲！」這些單純的情調，便是文學發生的要素。我們正過着的是艱苦的生活，我們的日常生活，便是一篇很好的創作、只等我們老老實實的把它用文字描寫出來。如果你是一個學徒，爲什麽不可以把你挨駡挨打和倒痰盂，洗烟袋的日常生活寫出來呢？如果你是一個機器工人、爲什麽不可以把你從廠主、工頭以及機器那裏所受的痛苦呌喊出來呢？如果你是生在没落的農家，你便可以寫出没落的悲哀；如果你是失業或失學，你便可以寫出失業或失學的恐慌和凄凉。而且，人是有思想的動物，在這樣的生活中，我們總有我們自己的希望，有我們生活的前程，這些，也就是創作的内容。我們旣有豐富的生活，我們爲什麽要怕創作？創作又有什麽神秘？難道文人雅士寫着「蔚藍的天」，我們換了「青天」就不行嗎？</p>
<p>二·亂創作。有一位現在有名的文學家兼敎授沈從文先生——這名字想大家都很熟悉————曾對怎樣寫小說的問題，有過這樣的意兒，以爲寫小說只要亂想，亂寫。這是不是對的呢？我們不能因爲他是敎授兼文學家就以爲對，這是不對的。這樣的亂想亂寫，只有那些把創作當成娛樂的文人雅士，只有那些把創作當成富翁品的文匠才做得到。我們是不應該這樣做的。我們要想，但我們不是幻想，我們的想，是要依據着我們所處的社會、緊靠着自己的生活去想。我們要寫，但不是無病呻吟的亂寫，我們的寫，是爲要呌出生活的病苦、暴露社會的罪惡而寫。所以，我們的創作，不是爲創作而創作，而是爲社會生活而創作。我們不僅創作態度要嚴肅，尤其是生活要嚴肅，這就是說，我們不能隨命運擺佈，與世浮沉，而需使自己生活，與一切推進社會的動力相結合。有實生活，才有創作，亂想亂寫，是决不成功的。不要看别的，只要看那位著作等身的沈從文先生自己，他自從升入敎授的寳座，儘可優游歲月與世無爭以後，他還能够寫出些什麽！</p>
<p>總之，創作的先决條件，是豐富的生活。我們旣不要「怕」，也不可「亂」，我們主要的一着，只是觀察社會和體騐生活。有了這一着，我們創作的初步而且是基本的工作，就算完成了。</p>
<p>於是，我們再來說到構成一篇創作的過程。</p>
<p>篇小說或一篇戲劇構成的骨幹是故事。這裏不說到詩，是因爲詩除叙事詩和史詩外，是没有故事的詩，只是一瞬間情感高度的衝激，如前面說到的碼頭工人勞働時便自然要先哼出「咳喲··咳喲」的音調。）在寫作時、首先我們要問自己的，就是在這複雜的社會現象中，在這煩瑣的生活中，應該截取那一片斷做我們創作的題材呢？如果這問題有了解决，我們便把那截取的某一片斷，經過頭腦的整理，構成一個單純的而又有條理的故事，這裏面便包含着認清故事的重心應該在那一點，卽我們表現的中心點是什麽，以及主人翁應該如何在這故事中出現。如果這一步完成了那我們便可毫不遲疑地用我們所能用的字句，把那故事照實寫出來。寫好後，當然並不能算是一篇作品，於是我們可以再在文字上和結構上，細心修改，認爲描寫不充分的地方，我們便必須增强；認爲是多餘描寫的地方，我們便必須删去。我們描寫技術的尺度，是簡捷明快，就是看是否已把故事中，我們所想表現的某一點或某一人物充分地表現了出來，和是否使人讀時能一目了然地得到一種快感。我們並不一定需要那些華麗的辭包，和調皮的句子，而且，重說一句，我們寫的時候是决不能先在那些字面上用力的。</p>
<p>總觀上面所及，關於怎樣研究文學這一問題，至少可以給讀者一個概念了吧？現在，還有兩個附屬的問題，不妨再提出來談談。</p>
<p>有些讀者來信問到··（一）研究文藝，先讀文藝創作還是先讀理論？（二）研究文藝是不是要讀社會科學？關於這兩個問題的回答是（一）本來創作與理論，是互相關聯的，是應該並進的。理論是創作的指針，創作是理論的骨幹。但現在一切學問都專門化了，創作家和理論家，已經是分途在各向各的前程努力，雖然理論家仍不能不讀創作，創作家也不能不懂初步的理論，而他們却各有偏向。所以要决定這問題，還須讀者先决定自己是研究文藝理論還是創作。不過倘是爲了初學起見，我們以爲最好先讀創作，因爲理論的原則畢竟是從創作中得來的。（二）在現社會，不僅研究文藝者，無論什麽人都應該有一點社會科學基本知識。可是，如果你的生活萬一不允許你有充分時間去讀，那末，最少你須讀兩本關於「辯證法唯物論」的書，因爲這可以帮助你去認識和分析社會、以至懂得社會在怎樣的動和你應該怎樣生活的方向。一個文學者，除了實際生活的體騐，這也是研究文學必具的條件。</p>

<p>二五比二八差三分受挫</p>
<p>中美英下星期重行决賽</p>
<p>萬國籃球賽、昨晚八時、共計兩塲、均爲妇子組、男子組錦標、早於上星期三解决、美國隊以兩戰兩勝之成績、獲得錦標、中華隊於男子錦標中雖遭淘汰、但於女子賽中、不無希望、中華幗巾曾首戰勝美、次戰再挫聯邦、昨晚之戰、第一塲爲美國戰聯邦、第二塲卽爲中華對英國、如昨晚能獲勝利、則錦標卽歸我有、不料中華隊竟三分之差而受挫、遂致中英美三國均以二勝一敗之均勢、而打成三角鼎立、須待三國再賽、始能解决錦標、昨晚之比賽、美之勝聯邦、固在意料之中、然中華隊之被英國所挫、實出於一般人意料之外、茲記兩塲比賽之情形如下、</p>
<p>美國戰勝聯邦</p>
<p>—二十六比十八—</p>
<p>美之戰勝聯邦、甚爲易易、第一節白乃特首開紀錄、聯邦爭扎多時、始由馬托中一球、未幾白乃特又告擲中、美之鮑賽克錦上添花、擲中一球、並罰二分、第一節旣畢、美以十比二導先、</p>
<p>第二節開始時、聯邦馬托、得籃下球、舉手成功、後由波拉姆罰中一球、並連中四分、復由馬托單乎抛中一球、此際聯邦遂以十一比十、反敗爲勝、美國於第二節中竟吃湯團、</p>
<p>但聯邦之勢、總覺薄弱、第三節開始時、雖憑前節之餘勇、首由雷斯瓦那擲中一球、但美白乃特乃連中二球、後復一鼓直下、聯邦乃一籌莫展、第四節中、聯邦雖用力掙扎、但終無濟於事、結果以二十六比十八、被美國所屈伏、</p>

<p>聯邦（一）二分（二）九分（三）三分（四）四分</p>
<p>中華敗於英國</p>
<p>—二十八比二五—</p>
<p>戰局旣開、肉搏一分鐘之久、英國派克希首開紀錄、並由Ｖ潑林斯罰中二球、未幾陳榮明得楊森之接濟、得以報復、旋又罰中一球、楊森亦舉手成功、陳聚才、亦得界外之擲球而擲中、陳榮明再罰中一分、Ｖ潑林斯亦罰進一球、如斯第一節終、中華隊以八比五之成績導先、</p>
<p>第二節開始、潑林斯又首先擲中、陳榮明屢罰不中、陳聚才則得寥祝元之接濟、乃得投射成功、此後敵　連進四分、中華隊乃以一分之差、被屈後、未幾陳榮明再得二分、但敵之Ｖ潑林斯亦以二分相還、中華隊又以一分被壓倒、在此忽進忽退情形之下、前半局告終、成績十二比十三、中華隊以一分之差而被小挫、</p>
<p>休息再戰、Ｖ潑林斯得籃下球而擲中、派克希則得遠擲之意外收穫、楊森衝至籃下、托擲得手、加上二分、但敵亦加二分、楊森再進一球、但仍較英隊遜一分、後由陳榮明罰中乃成十九比十九之平局、此後英隊連進三分、中華隊則由楊森擲中一球、陳榮明罰進一分、成爲二十二比二十二之均勢、完第三節、</p>
<p>最後一節、爲雙方之生死關頭、中華隊屢失良機、英隊行中二分、中華岌岌可危、乃由陳聚才調出潘夢、入塲卽中一球、但敵隊愈逞其兇、最後由陳榮明罰中一球、總結果二十五比二十八、中華隊以三分之差而失敗、試觀在四節比賽中、英國之犯規特多、陳榮明與楊森之執罰、中者極鮮、設昨日對罰球稍加注意、則錦標早已在手、　　英國　犯規得分中華　犯規　得分</p>

<p>雙方苦守不分勝負</p>
<p>萬象華一脚定江山</p>
<p>—西聯甲組賽一幕—</p>
<p>東華優游西聯足球甲組賽中、昨日第二次相逢於中華棒球塲、結果東華以一比零戰勝優游、報復上次在逸園之慘敗、比賽動作清晰、和氣可觀、雙方攻守、皆異常小心、直至最後之一刻鐘、江善敬傷出、東華方乘機攻入、以一比零定勝負、觀者二三千人而已、</p>
<p>勢均力敵　昨日東華優游、誠所謂勢均而力敵、旗鼓以相當、加以雙方之和和氣氣、毫無劇烈之動作發見、因此比賽之局勢、减少一大部份之緊張、且雙方皆取嚴守策略、球勢乃始終如一、不急不弛之形狀中進行、謂之有味亦可、謂之平平、亦當然之事也、</p>
<p>兩次危機　東華開球、吳守衡吹呌笛、順風而下、直逼優游、戴李兩鋒、節節前進、優游嚴陣以守、陳家球改任後防、未忝厥職、東華攻勢雖多、終不得人、二十五分鐘之際、萬象華在左角妙送一球、恰落門前、小戴眼見來得正好、對凖一脚、不料唐永純、托個正着、球向空飛上、一陣南風、吹落門後、亦云奇矣、繼又見李義臣舉足可中之球、以周光中之越位而退、上半時可記者若是、</p>
<p>局面稍變　下半時相對易位、優游順風、其勢頓變、孫錦順改居中鋒、優游亦見其大小三軍、進窺東華、梁樹棠機會雖多、以頭功與脚踢、皆欠凖確、毫無成效、鍾奚合作、亦常見功虧一簣、東華禮尙往來、萬象華最見活躍、以安樂生之較弱、大有難看小萬之概、向右一脚、賈幼良大可接之攻入、忽足未伸而人已倒、圍攻結果、依舊零零、</p>
<p>最後成敗　離終局僅餘十五分鐘、優游守衛綫突告破潰、大將江善敬腿筋挫傷、不得已退出、於是小萬之一衝、安樂生之一失足、連人帶球、冲進門内、小唐惟有嘆功虧一簣、一塲和局、於此打破、優游還攻、已减其力、東華再勝、亦屬難事、卽以此一對零終局、</p>

<p>竟以十二比零之數受挫</p>
<p>西聯甲組足球賽之一幕</p>
<p>曁南足球隊昨在逸園與臘克斯作西聯甲組賽、又以十二比零之鉅數、遭空前之慘敗、該隊近以健將星散、迭受挫折、昨日又適逢江大籃球賽之期、顧尙勷羅海光俱赴京比賽、於是實力更受影響、然該隊能自始至終、努力抵抗、亦堪嘉許也、　　上半時負去六隻兩方軍隊趕到逸園、但已過法定時間、直至三時十分、始行開戰、曁南在東、臘克斯在西、背日順風、便宜不少、曁南開球稍一盤旋、卽被馬達搶去、五前鋒生龍活虎、繼續攻打曁南後防、文賴兩後衛、四處張羅、陳鎭祥調兵回頭、恊同防守、八分鐘後却克倫鑽出人對叢、一發中的、往來七分鐘、哈培在再告得乎、此後曁南形勢、愈見不濟、支持至三十分、鮑塞利奇兵又起、低射得功、却克倫頭上開花、成四對零、鮑休利咫尺獲球、迨却克倫造成六對零之後、上半時始告終了、</p>
<p>下半時再來半打小梅守門、萬分氣憤、於是攘臂而出、調回符和萱、自任右内鋒、滿擬還我東南半壁、無如士氣沮喪、軍無鬥志、</p>
<p>内宫禁地、時見臘隊人馬、縱横裨闔、僻易萬人、曁南在三度進攻未曾得手以後、黑突生沿邊直下、賴作榮逼成角球、開向中央、勃勞特候個正着、頂入網窩、無何符和萱祗顧眼前、不防背後、又中勃勞特暗箭、鮑塞利死不饒人、乘風放火、哈培克錦上添花、高士漁翁得利、哈培克又得十二碼機會、乃造成一打對零之罕見數目、</p>

<p>兩路足球會甲組隊應滙西球隊之約、於星期六（三月十七日）在麥根路球塲舉行友誼賽、是日匯西方面、盡集徐家匯一帶健將、實力極强、兩路甲組隊則因中鋒劉希孟左翼費福煦、及後衛駱美倫離滬他出、不得已將較次陣綫應戰、姚良梁仲康朱欽軒馮頌乾黃金全沈秉聰唐文威朱振和劉希孟沈葆昌郁鏗</p>

<p>日本拉黃包車的車夫、都會看報，在馬路上停着没有遇到生意時候，常見他們拿着報紙，在那裏看，因爲日本拉車的車夫，都是由小學畢業的，所以看報能看得懂，日本對於小學敎育，呌作强迫敎育，如果是兒童到了學齡，不進學校，就要處罰他的父母，所以人人都識字，没有什麽」文盲，」報館比我國多，看報的人更比我國人多，報館的報紙銷數、要比我國每天各報銷數多好幾倍、返觀我國，不識字的「文盲，」不知道有多少！拉車的車夫，曾見過有那個看報嗎？這都是小學敎育不發達的緣故，我們只知恨日本人强横，要曉得他敎育比我國好，所以國家纔有這樣强呢！</p>
<p>據二十日報載，江蘇一省，失學兒童數佔百分之八十六，約有四百萬弱，這樣大的失學數目，殊可驚人，江蘇如此，他省可知，照這樣看來，凡是得着父兄的力量，能够提着書包，天天到學校去受課，這是何等的幸福！若不努力用功，不是自暴自棄嗎？</p>
<p>語云「兒童爲將來中國主人翁，」責任非常重大，所以今年稱爲「兒童年，」可憐那許多失學的小朋友，一時是没法想，我期望已入學的小朋友，要個個做個好學生，將來我國纔有希望。</p>
<p>在三十餘年前，日本打勝了俄國，不歸功於軍隊、歸功於小學敎員，因爲小學敎員，養成全國良好小學生，纔有勝俄的好結果，可見小學生對於國家，有莫大的關係，顧亭林云··「國家興亡，匹夫有責，」我換句話講一講··「國家興亡，兒童有責，」失學兒童，旣已失學，入學兒童，更要格外勤學了·國難如此，小朋友趕快努力，趕快努力·</p>

<p>小朋友··你們看見過「林肯」這個名字嗎？他是美國第十六世的大總統。</p>
<p>他的家裏很窮苦，所以小時候和他的爸爸媽媽住在一間木屋裏面。林背的床舖，祗不過一堆乾的樹葉。但他不以爲苦，一天到晚很是愉快。</p>
<p>他在學校裏祇讀了一年書，但他很喜歡書，很肯用功勤讀。</p>
<p>他待人很和氣、他的朋友對他很親愛。</p>
<p>後來他做律師，美國的人民都很敬愛他，公舉他做美國的大總統。林肯於是解放了美國最痛苦的黑奴，這是很有功於人道的。</p>
<p>他死在西歷一千八百六十五年，離現在大概七十年。</p>
<p>小朋友··你們也敬愛林肯嗎？你們應該把他作爲模範！</p>

<p>「誠哥，我現在有一個使我十分懷疑的問題要來問你，是我平常所見到，聽到的，你允許我問嗎？」實兒是一個十一二歲的孩子，他臉上現出希望他哥哥允許他的神情。</p>
<p>旁邊站着一個較他大一些的孩子，這就是他的哥哥—誠兒—他聽得他的弟弟在問他，就說道··「實弟，你有疑問就</p>
<p>問我，不要放在心裏不敢問，但是過難的問題，恐怕我也不能回答吧。」</p>
<p>實兒聽得他哥哥允許他問·便開始問了。</p>
<p>「誠哥，我每天早晨起身，看見東方有一個血紅的太陽、漸漸的從東方升起，到了下午，漸漸的從西方没入，照這樣看來，太陽能行動的。但是我又聽得人家說··「太陽不會行動。太陽的從東方升起到西方没入，是地球在旋轉。」誠哥！到底太陽會行動的嗎？旣然地球會旋轉，那麽我們人類和其他一切的東西，不是要掉下來嗎？」</p>
<p>誠兒因爲很熟悉這自然現象，便很流利的說。</p>
<p>「實弟，天上不會行動的星球呌恒星，凡繞恒星而旋轉的星球呌行星，還有燒行星而旋轉的星球呌衛星。太陽是恒星之一所以不會行動。地球是行星之一是繞太陽而旋轉的，並且是從西向東、運轉不息，所以每天看見太陽從東方升起到西方没入。地球是會旋轉的。不過我們人類和其他一切東西，决不會掉下去，因爲地球裏面有很强大的吸力，這種吸力呌做地心吸力，把人類和其他一切的東西都吸住了，但是人類依然可以自由行動。」</p>
<p>實兒聽了他哥哥的話，很爲感激，因爲他哥哥又給了他一種新的智識。</p>

<p>冬帶走了他的兒子——雪，春的女神，開始張着兩手，降到人間。我聰明的小朋友們！你們已有過春天的計劃嗎？</p>
<p>要知道春是最美麗不過的節季，不要放過了。哪咳須充分的欣賞。小朋友！你們尙未定有計劃的，在下面幾條裏選擇吧！</p>
<p>（一）旅行　集合多數的朋友，各人出若干旅行費，（備膳費用）由年紀較長的一二人作領導，徒步到鄰近的市鎭上去。</p>
<p>（二）到野外去　倘然不能實行第一條的話，那麽只可約三五小朋友，到野外去散步了。最好還帶些麵包及罐頭食物之類，在郊外席地圍食，更饒興趣了。</p>
<p>（三）公園　假使離鄉野太遠了，可到幾個規模較大的公園裏去。好的公園，有些也不亞於鄉野的幽靜與美麗呢。　到於春遊的利益，約有三種：</p>
<p>（一）能增加見聞</p>
<p>（二）能增長文思</p>
<p>（三）能調劑精神</p>
<p>（四）小朋友！你們不要讓大好的春天逃過呀！</p>

<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>據一匣火柴說··「擦的一聲，在匣子兩旁的任何一旁擦去了黑點，迸出了紅光，消失了我們的生命力，輕輕地落在地上，這是我們每個同胞的最後結局。我們是欣然地願意有如此的命運的。」</p>
<p>作怪的，何以那會客室書桌上的一匣火柴却要和命運反抗。</p>
<p>它們也有理由··「我們是不願給主人派作抽烟時的燃燒烟捲的工作。這工作不能給與我們所敬愛的人類以益處。」　事與願合，夜裏，耗子打翻了一瓶水，水潑在它們的身上。</p>
<p>第二天，主人就把這匣火柴扔到户外去。凑巧，給一個檢舊貨的孩子拾去。　孩子將這匣火柴放在爐上烘乾，恢復了它們已失的能力，此後，孩子珍重地派每枝火柴做烹茶煮飯時的事情。</p>
<p>每枝火柴滿意地笑了··「和命運反抗，却盡了我們最大的功用了。」</p>

<p>— 若虚</p>
<p>章兒和他的父親乘電車出外買物，電車初開的時候，車中的人差不多都向後猝倒，後來電車一停，乘客又都幾乎向前仆下，好像站不穩一般，章兒十分奇怪，總想不出這個道理來，後來他父親告訴他說··「這是一個自然上的問題凡是一件物體，都有一種特别的性質，這種性質稱爲慣性，或呌惰性，就是「一件物體，如果它在動，那末牠總是喜歡繼續不停的動下去，假如它不動，那末它牠總是停着，除非另外有一種力量去和它爲難。」這個性質是英國的一位大學問家牛頓發現的」</p>
<p>章兒聽了他父親的話，心中一個不釋的疑團，不覺已經無形無形的解决了，最後他父親又告訴他說··「這慣性的現象，本來是很普通的，但是因爲牛頓能够常常注意世界上各種普通的事、所以纔能成爲著名的學問家。」</p>

<p>小朋友！你每天刷牙齡嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友！你現在可以拿一面鏡子，照照你的牙齒。你的牙齒潔白麽？有牙污留著麽？有蟲蛀的地方麽？你都要注意到。</p>
<p>你不要忽略你那小小的牙齒！它對於衛生是很有關係的。假使你的牙齒不潔凈，他可以把你的牙齒都毁壞了。也許他再會從食物帶到你的壯子裏，來毁壞你的肚子。</p>
<p>所以，小朋友··你假使平時不注意你的牙齒，從現在起，你要開始注意了。你請求你的爸爸或媽媽買一個牙刷，和一瓶或牙粉或者牙膏。牙刷上的毛，要揀軟一些的。你在每天晚間，早晨，和吃過食物以後，都要刷一次，不要讓食物留在牙齒間腐爛。這樣成了習慣以後，對於你的健康，一定有很大的帮助。</p>

<p>？</p>
<p>靈兒沉思了一會，說：「爸爸，有了，有了，酒是多麽香的東西呀！現在我們立刻把它灑一些在樓上的地板上，那麽蚊子們嗅着了香味，豈不要全飛到樓上去嗎？等到他們全上樓了，我們立刻把扶梯取下，他們豈不是不好下來嗎那麽我們可在樓下安睡了。」</p>

<p>今天我在書房裏。又聽見鸚哥在外面高聲呌：「貓來了。貓來了。貓來捉我尾巴毛，怎麽得了！」我心中想：「莫不是鸚哥又在和我開玩笑吧？」所以我就不出去看。過了一會兒，我走到外面去。却看見鸚哥眞的被貓咬死在地上了！</p>

<p>氣候的轉換，自然的變化，在都市裏只多感覺「冷熱」遞嬗而已，在我們的農村裏，是毫不假借，它隨時變化，就隨時拿出證據給我們看。剛剛過去未久的冬天，它所顯示的冰天雪地，樹林脫下外套，掛上銀果；大地蕭索，凄凉，死板。現在的時序是「春」了，然而給我們農村的證據是什麽？</p>
<p>春天來了，來了！我們歡迎！但爲甚姗姗來遲？春啊！你也知不？世界上幾多可憐蟲殘在「冬」的淫威之下！小朋友們！過去的冬，旣足以詛咒，睡棄；這驅冬的「春」，就值得我們來熱烈地恭維，迎迓；然而，春是什麽？</p>
<p>春的來，我們農村裏用不着天文學校來精密的計算，它的來，自有暗示給我們。——白粉也似的晨霜，已經皮腐肉爛，而是點點滴滴地明晃晃地珠粒了。一吹冷入骨子裏的風婆，也歛了威勢，只是温和柔順地和人們親嘴。大地的一切，都凖備着活動，在這個世界裏去活躍。此地，大有生氣勃勃之勢，不久的將來的變化多着呢！朋友，以後我要報告春的消息了。特此預約。</p>

<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>有兩句金石不移的古話：「長江後浪推前浪，世上新人替舊人。」這不但整句形容盡了江水的滾滾東流，和人事歷史的息息變化；單是那一個「推一，一個「替」，也彀表明長江是「活的」，世上也是「活的」。</p>
<p>立在「三一八」子夜的前頭，靜悄悄地回顧數十年來的民族解放運動，尤其是婦女解放運動、試拿一枝筆照那運動的程度，畫一條弧綫。從光緒二十年代起，便有那啓蒙的天足運動，女學運動，秋瑾女士等的參加推翻滿</p>
<p>清運動。到了辛亥年，便有女子北伐隊，女子軍事團。臨時政府成立後，女子軍雖被解散，接着便有唐羣英等所領導的女子參政運動。元年三月十九日，因參議院没有通過婦女參政案，二十日便有婦女搗毁參議院、踢傷警兵的一大亂事。自此以後，「模仿男子」的婦女運動·漸漸改變，不久中</p>
<p>華大地，來了一個袁世凱氷河時代；於此期中，世上没有活躍，只是靜止。過不多時，平靜的水上起了波浪，相衝相激，成爲轟烈的新文化運動；大有「遠望潮頭一綫來，縷前指顧雪成堆」之慨。這時的婦女運動，也進一步提出了「破壞貞操！破壞舊倫理！」的口號。不待說在此期的民族解放運動中，如民八，如民十五，婦女都合理地表現了氣力，婦女已經是以社會的人物自許。十五十六年的北伐，敢說缺少了婦女，要缺少許多效果。五卅慘案，沙基慘案，以及「三一八」北京各界的反抗八國軍隊在沽河自由航行案，每次都有不少的婦女被犧牲。這時期是婦女解放運動最激烈期，也就是民族解放運動最激烈期，於此可見兩者相輔的關係。自光緒二十年代以至於民國十六七年，婦女的運動，一波高似一波，一輩强似一輩，到這時執筆畫弧綫的人，簡直可以投筆大呌一聲「快哉！」</p>
<p>然而「婦運」時運不齊，現時恰逢着無能的我輩，眼看牠消沉消沉，至於靜止。無以繼往，無以開來，夫復何言？</p>
<p>只是，一時的現象，終勝不過自然永久的鐵律··平等，解放，終究是鐵律所規定。爲報那些被虐待的婢女，被摧殘了的娼妓，被磨折了的女工，等等不幸的婦女所發出的哀怨的呼聲，無能的當代婦女的我們，只有含羞忍憤地安慰牠們一句··「還有偉大的後浪」！</p>

<p>中國是一個什麽都是畸形發展的國家。僅就日常生活來說，有的窮奢極侈，盡情享樂，上自飛禽走獸，下及爬虫蛇鱉，什麽熊掌猴腦，燕窩人參，享盡人間口福，餐盡世間珍奇，博得了好吃的美名，傳聞中外，狐裘繡綺水汀電風，天威不足畏，終日如坐春風和煦中，畫閣彫樓，崇樓大厦，不管生産之在十一二世紀，而盡量做着二十世紀的消費者。至於另一角，也可以說大多數，則衣不足以蔽體，食不足果腹—亦有無衣可衣，無食可食者，茅屋廬舍，凉亭廟角，是絶好居留地。至於行，幸有老娘生給他天然自動車，除出水裏空裏，尙可行走如意，這些已是普遍的現象，用不着我來贅述，救濟之道，有着民生主義。</p>
<p>這裏我要說的，是由上述的生活形態，而聯想到最近的新生活運動。新生活運動，當然凡是圓臚方趾的大中華民國的人民不管男女老幼，個個都得遵行的。不過一切事，都有創之者，行之者，從而傚之者之分，古歌謠有；「城中好高髻，四方高一尺，城中好大袖，四方全匹帛，城中好廣眉，四方且半額」之句，活描出上行下傚之態。城市的摩登太太小姐們，旣能處處步武西洋婦女之後塵，以他們這種勇於改進，善於模仿的精神，我以爲這次新生活運動開始中，應該是摩登層來當先鋒。</p>
<p>新生活運動的目標，在於日常生活道德，合於禮，義，廉，恥。本來「衣食足而後知禮義」但世風已不古，衣足食足者，却有忘了古訓「禮義廉恥」要復興民族，誠應有如美國的藍鷹運動，人人應佩有此徽章，物物得印有此標記。不過一般村姑鄉嫗，雖在衣食不足的荒地上生活，然或尙不至有違乎古訓。他們的生活。雖够不上講整齊清潔，但已盡簡中之簡，樸中之樸。在人類尙未發明吃空氣可以飽腹，披空氣可以禦寒以前，已無再簡再樸之可言了。所以我以爲新生活運動尤應讓諸優閒生活中的摩登太太小姐們來先行。那時我可改古謠曰：「城中好廉潔，四方啖草秣，城中好布衣，四方披草席，城中棄脂粉，四方尙黃黑。」這樣上行下傚地行着潔樸之風，以及兼行其他軍事化合理化以後，眞會像蔣委員長所說的「那時無論是要廢除一切不平等條約，無論是要報仇雪恥，復興我們的民族，都不是難事」—</p>
<p>摩登的太太小姐們，有領導四方婦女之責，因爲村姑鄉嫗，一有了你們的優閒生活，也會唯你們馬首是瞻，且或倍而加之。當此生之者寡，食之者衆之秋，你們又都遵着古訓，守着男子治外，女子治内的箴言，安居於食之者之列，徴之一般現象，士大夫之林，買辦武將之列，公子少爺之徒，常有一人擁胡數個家庭，新的，舊的，正的，副的，無其名而有其實的。其間被養者，除出少數的舊者以外，誰都够得上摩登之層，而摩登層之物質享樂，正是名副其實。在此高呼呌着「禮義廉恥，復興民族」之日，我有厚望於摩登層</p>
<h3 id="c221">愛情給與我的 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 琳琳</p>
<p>這裏是我對於人生的一點兒經歷，把它寫下來，貢獻給我青年的，未結婚的女同胞們作一個借鏡·</p>
<p>在六七年前，我是一個「愛情神聖」論的信徒；且認爲愛情是人生至上的寳貝··唯一的安慰；它可以給人們最大的力量與勇氣來完成她們偉大的事業；它亦可以把頽喪的青年振作·所以我還未能把自己所學的告一段落，就和我現在的丈夫—愛人結婚了·</p>
<p>但是，結婚以後的情形是怎樣了呢？愛情是給與了我什麽呢？丈夫確是愛我，他把我的生活亦規劃得非常安定，我從他那裏拿到了錢，卽所謂家庭經常費，每天我都是在經營我們寢室的整潔美麗，廚房的工作，兒女們着看護，婚後的生活就都被限制在這些上面。婚前的種種理想，求智的慾望，完全打得粉碎·我是完全和社會脫離了，我所認得的朋友，親戚，隣居等等，他們，她們都把我丈夫的名姓來和我交談，都拿我丈夫的關係來與我來往。我很明白，這是我自己造成下來的附屬品的頭銜，套在自己的頸上來。因爲我對面的　女士，他人都不把她當作她丈夫的附屬物來看待她，與她交往·卽是由於她在某機關服務，就是她有智識，有直接參加社會事業的專長啊！我現在是成了智識技術的殘廢者，應當做家庭的隸奴，丈夫的附屬物，社会的寄生。</p>
<p>現在丈夫失業了，生活是一天迫緊一天，雖經各方面節省儉用，亦無補於萬一·家庭呈現慘悶的景象，前途非常地暗淡，丈夫終日愁眉不展，我設盡方法去安慰他，那只是更加一些焦急給他。隨後我亦知道這種安慰不是他所需要者，他是需要有一個人，這個人是能够帮助他生活，解决失業的痛苦者·但是，但是，我已經成了智識殘廢者，技術殘廢者，我怎能爲他解决呢？</p>
<p>我現在覺悟了，愛情並不是人生唯一的事業，愛情不能作爲我們終身生活的保障，它只是人們生活的一小部份。並且，一個女子在未和一男子談愛情之先，應當把你的智識充實，完成自己可以謀生的專門技能，得以直接參與社會一切生産事業，卽你就可以不作你將來丈夫的附屬物，社會的寄生，你亦可帮助你的丈夫，解决家庭中的困難，不幸，及意外的遭遇。你的家庭將永久都是快樂的，幸福的。你個人在社會上是獨立的，健全的。</p>
<h3 id="c222">現代文學中的新女性型 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>現代的智識階級女性，似乎都有一個美麗的憧憬··「做一個新的人」。</p>
<p>說「美麗的，」其實一點也没有譏剌的意味，在現社會制下面，敎育的特權似乎祗停留在小資産階級或以上各層的女性身上，她們的唯一的特性，就是喜歡把自己的世界建築在未來的想像裏面；而現實的醜惡的面貌，就必然地被厭惡了。</p>
<p>於是在美麗的想像的世界中，她們開始創造了一種典型的新女性的雕像。</p>
<p>美國作家劉易士。辛克萊（ＳＩＮＣＬＡＩＲＬＥＷＩＳ）去年寫了一本小說呌「安·維克」，書店的廣告上大書特書的說這是劉易士的第一本用女性做主角的小說。在這裏，他寫了大戰前後十多年内的美國女性；那時候美國的智識階級女性，還帶着極濃厚的個人主義氣息，愛自由，愛活動，愛事業，所謂「社會人員」（ＳＯＣＩＡＬＷＯＲＫＥＲ）是當時最流行的名詞。牠們在相同的社會制度下面，建築了相同的新女性型··受了敎育的，不滿於現社會制的，富於改造力的，富於感情的，她們都想做個社會上的名流，把大事業的權力握在手裏，在醜惡的現實世界中，做一個近代的救世主，她們用憐恤的聲調對大衆喊··</p>
<p>「你們受苦了嗎？别嚷，看我來給你們弄好！」</p>
<p>可是對於這種人，大衆是不會去回答她們的　，因爲她們始終祗做了一個神，一個救世主；她們是把自己的地位放在大衆的頭上的。</p>
<p>辛克萊的觀察或許是對的，據說這本「安·維克」出版以來，銷路並不壞，受了許多智識階級女性的愛好，尤其動人的，據說是結束的時候，作者還是没有忘記把他那位代表了二十世紀初葉的美國新女性的安，維克博士放進了愛的圈子。</p>
<p>在美國新進作家帕索斯（ＪＯＨＮＤＯＳＰＡＳＳＯＳ）的「四十二緯度」和「一九一九」中，我們同樣地可以找出屬於這一型的新女性來。</p>
<p>而事實上，這正代表了一切屬於智識階級的新女性。這「新女性」，在一切的事業的追求中，她始終祇扮演了一個可憐的神——神在現社會的地位如何，我們是不難看到的。</p>
<p>如果要毫不容情地說，現代的女性，無論是屬於那一種羣的，在經濟與社會地位的戰線上，並没有得到什麽成功。在家庭的牽累，夫權的使行，和其他不良的社會制度下面，更進一步地去學習是必需的。從革拉特考夫的長篇小說」水門汀」中，我們可以看到從溶爐中形成了的新女性的輪廓··離開了家庭三年去參加戰事的丈夫，回來的時候，完全不認識那年輕的妻子了，她不再能忍受「到床上來！」的命令了，不再是個賢明的管家婦了。</p>
<p>「那兒有硬麵包與咖啡，你自己弄來吃吧，明天我還得有許多事要做呢」妻子對離别了三年的丈夫說的。</p>
<p>「見了什麽鬼呢？」</p>
<p>這眞是一套神奇的魔術，三年的時間，就把一個年輕的女人變成這個樣子了。</p>
<p>可是正因爲這是從人的社會中得來的訓練，而這訓練，也許是現代的新女性所必需的。</p>
<p>當然不想把新女性定一個模型，那根本是無聊的；但現代的新女性，該從家事中解放出來，無論在經濟，文化，及其他的條件上，去努力取得和男子同等的地位，而同等地去做一點更有意義的事情，似乎是必需的吧？</p>

<h3 id="c223">丹麥女敎育總長尼奈彭夫人 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 學文</p>
<p>一般人對於兩性的觀念總不能除掉下面的一種偏見，就是女子和男子在能力上有種種差異，女子辦理一件事情，大多很少有自己的主張，一味跟着人家「人云亦云，」做事的「優柔寡斷，」等等。但是這一種偏見，我們現在看了尼奈彭夫人的辦事手段，就可知道這是不對的。</p>
<p>她是丹麥人，做過丹麥的敎育總長。她就任時，一個美國的某雜誌記者，這樣批評她說··「她是女性的，而且急進的！」我們聽了這一句批評的話，也就可知道她是如何的一個人了。</p>
<p>人家所不敢做的兩件事··</p>
<p>她蒞任後不久，就做了兩件人家所不敢做的事。</p>
<p>第一件，是罷黜皇家劇塲的理事。在丹麥，原來有一個偉大的國立藝術機關，呌做皇家劇塲。這裏面有許多古今著名的作品，更有一大班演劇團和跳舞隊，在國内是極有悠久的歷史和名望的。但是，這劇塲的四個理事，依着因襲的規例，必須呌一個有伯爵資格的做主任。可是，每個伯爵，都不能專心從事於其劇塲的職務，其餘的理事，也趁此敷衍塞責起來了。因此，這劇塲的内部。變得腐敗不堪。甚至徒有其形式而空擁着歷史的虚名了。尼奈彭失人蒞任後見此情形，就大謂不然。結果，她將那伯爵和辦事不力的理事革職，只留用一個能勝任的理事，呌他專心辦去，於是那劇塲就整飭起來了。</p>
<p>那個可憐的伯爵呢，她只是說他是「無用的塵埃。」</p>
<p>第二件，是取締敎區的干涉學校。在丹麥，原來敎會的勢力是遍布各處的，　各敎區的牧師，可以有視察學校的特權，那學校如果敎授宗敎科不出力，就要被敎區懲戒。於是每個活潑潑的孩子，都給宗敎科將心靈弄得呆滯了。尼奈彭蒞任後，對此又大不謂然，她一面就竭力贊助敎師聯合會，反對敎會的視察；一面將敎師講習所的主任，下令革職。這樣一來，敎區於學校因襲的權勢，就無形消滅了。</p>
<p>這兩件，都是丹麥歷來的敎育總長所不敢爲的，而她竟依着自己的主張實行了。</p>
<p>她的事略··</p>
<p>尼奈彭夫人做過的事還很多。她生於一八六六年，早年就加入社會民主黨，在丹京一個著名的大學得到碩士學位。一九○三年担任社會民主黨總部事務</p>
<p>員。一九一七年任事於丹京工部局。一九一八年做上議院議員。她的著作物很多，關於歷史和經濟方面的。丈夫是一個哲學博士，也是熱心社會民主運動的。</p>
<h3 id="c224">遼寧蓋平縣婦女生活的概况 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 志白</p>
<p>—我國内地婦女生活的一斑—</p>
<p>遼寗蓋平縣是一個漢，滿，回三族雜居的地方，漢族約佔三分之二，滿族較少，回族是最少。因此風俗和習慣慚慚的，　漢族就把滿族回族同化了。並且彼此通婚，固有的習俗，變成混合式的。各族婦女的狀况，很少見還有固有的，不同的餘痕存在着。現在，我把這地的婦女生活，簡單地寫一個有系統的叙述，以獻於一班愛知各地風俗人情者之前。</p>
<p>（一）家庭</p>
<p>在遼寗蓋平縣的婦女，在家庭方面的責任，對於長輩是孝順和遵命，對於平輩是寬恭和敬，對於下輩是撫養敎訓，她們的心靈中滿佈着「賢媳淑女」「賢妻良母」的好思想。她們被舊的鎖鏈—三從四德，夫唱婦隨束縛着。凡事得聽丈夫的指揮和敎導。她們在家庭中，處在被指使的地位，一些權利得不到。但是她們並不爭執，所謂「男女平權」的思想，壓根就未入她們的腦筋。</p>
<p>（二）智識</p>
<p>因爲敎育的不普及，　女學校在蓋平縣是僅有簡易女師，高小和初小幾校，男校不招女生，女校不招男生。鄉下更無女校。　人們都　　「女子無才便是德」的老道德，貧人更是無力就學，所以受過敎育的婦女像鳳毛麟角一樣。一般的婦女是不開化的，鄙陋的，不懂世事人情的。她們的腦筋中有烈女傳，名賢集，女子道德經等的故事盤旋着。新的智識是不會侵入她們的腦筋。</p>
<p>（二）衣服和裝飾</p>
<p>漢族的婦女是大多數穿着短衣服的，還有少數纒足。—雖下令放足，但還有很多人都是纒足的—滿，回族的婦女大多數是穿旗袍，是天足。漢族梳饅頭首式的頭，滿回梳大蓬式的頭。這些是仍保存着種族上明顯的痕跡。至於剪髮的婦女，在蓋平縣是很少見的，她們頭上戴着花臉上擦着粉，嘴唇抹上胭脂以及足上穿着花鞋。她們這樣的裝飾，自己心靈中是藏着無限的美感，顧影徘徊，儼若天仙，面孔上現着趾高氣揚的神氣，也曾煊示於人，也能獻媚於人。</p>
<p>（四）儉樸和勤苦耐勞</p>
<p>蓋平縣的婦女是非常樸素，節儉金錢，布衣布鞋，徒步走道，她們有儉樸的美德。到了春天，和男人一樣的在地播種，種地。夏天，在炎熱的火球下，和男人一樣的鋤地。秋天，她們下田地，上塲院，拚命的工作着。到了冬天，因爲，田地無事可做，可是在家中也時時刻刻地在針繡，紡蔴繩等的工作着。他們這種的勤苦耐勞，不亞於男子漢，這種精神眞可令人佩服。</p>
<p>（五）職業</p>
<p>蓋平縣是以農業爲主，婦女多半是在家裏作活。因爲容易生活和受舊道德的束縛，婦女不能到外去工作，實在貧窮不堪，乃迫不得已的，才去當女工。婦女在家裏閒睱的時可以作紡蔴繩，紡綫，紡牛毛，針繡等工作，能賺幾個銀錢，俗語所謂彌補「鞋頭脚面的用費。」這算是她們的零外職業—也可以說是她們的副業。</p>
<p>（六）風俗素描</p>
<p>照例在整個的正月中，婦女是停止了工作，忌諱針綫的動搖。她們藉着閒暇的時間，想出種種的古怪方式。像請竈籬姑姑，用磕頭表示的方法，來預卜年景的好壞。正月初七的那天，婦女都要吃蘿蔔—據云能够保持一年不牙疼。正月十五的晚上，她們都到冰上去滑冰，能够一年不腿痛。這些可笑的迷信事太多了。她們最信仰算命的瞎子先生，在一個正月裏，她們時當要算命，對於這種化費，她們是毫不吝惜的。女人過臘月二十二·不能再登娘家的門—恐妨娘家不好。正月初六以前，女人不能看娘家祖先上的供菜和臘—看着是妨娘家不利的—婦女如在身上縫衣，（不脫衣服）嘴上必啣着烟袋—恐爲别人賴她作賊。這就是蓋平縣婦女風俗之一斑了。以上略述的六節，就是蓋平縣婦女生活的梗概。</p>

<p>四·配偶的選擇</p>
<p>—對方有無性病—</p>
<p>選擇配偶，當然有許多條件，例如對方的人格，知識，經濟能力，健康狀態等，都應該有十二分的審察，現在單就健康一項，加以述說··就遺傳及優生學的見地上講，患有結核症，癩病，性病的人，絶對應避免與之結婚，而其中尤以性病爲最可怕··所以選擇配偶時，應以絶對無性病者爲第一條件。世間有不少女子，因丈夫有性病，而默然度着不幸的痛苦生活·</p>
<p>男女因生理組織的不同，男子徧於能動的，不易度禁欲生活，但現在這種社會制度下，因謀生的不易，男子常陷於無能力結婚，或晚婚，因之性病的危險率亦隨之而增高。考諸性病的治療，非常困難，完全治好，旣須相當時日，亦須相當的金錢，且治療一旦中斷，有從此不能斷根的危險。假使有一女子，與這樣一個男子結婚，她的痛苦將如何？所以應於結婚前，請可靠的醫師，出一健康診斷書，互相交換，這是未結婚前，應行的必要手續。萬一有一對相愛的男女，未將届結婚之期，若男方自知有性病，應在未婚前，告知女方，由醫師證明已完全治療，始再結婚。</p>
<p>去年日本出了一椿所謂結婚解消問題，事實是有一對情投意合的戀人，由二人的愛合，父母的允諾，擇日結婚，經過莊嚴熱閙的結婚儀式後，當夜洞房，女的發現了男的有性病，卽時宣告雙方家族。提出解消婚約，當時雙方賀客尙未散盡，聽到了這個消息，莫不爲之驚愕，而女的却貿然决然，謂非立卽解消不可，終至當衆取消了婚約，仍帶了她的純潔心身歸回了母家，這消息在去年曾傳遍了全日本，一般輿論認爲有理智的新女性的不屈不撓的正當手段。認爲對不負責任的男性的一個打擊。</p>

<h3 id="c265">自殺問題 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 一平</p>
<p>人們的一切努力和奮鬭，所爲的都是一個「生」字。在我們的時代中，就是窮得身無分文的人，也要向人家哀乞求憐，弄點剩飯剩菜來維持其生存；至於那些有錢的人，當然更想長生不老，永恒的過着非常舒服的日子。生，無論富貴貧賤，實在是誰都貪戀的。</p>
<p>然而奇怪，世間却有許多活生生的人自殺！近年來的中國，自殺者的數目更是日益增加。單就上海一隅來說，在各種新聞紙上平均每禮拜必有好幾件自殺的新聞被刊載着。這是什麽原因呢？對於這個問題，一般都是表面的從自殺者個人方面去理解··如果自殺者是因了失戀而自殺的，便說這原因在於失變··如果自殺者是因了經濟壓迫而自殺的，便說這原因在於經濟壓迫。但問題却不像這樣的簡單。</p>
<p>首先我們應該知道，在無數的自殺者中，不管其自殺的直接原因是如何不同，不管其自殺的方法是怎樣的差異，但他們中却有一個相同的地方——卽他們之自殺，是由於他們對一切都感到了没有希望所致。假如一個人他還有一點希望，在他們的前面還有一絲兒光明的話，我敢說無論如何他是不會自殺的。</p>
<p>希望，雖可說是人類的一種本能，但規定人類具有怎樣的希望的，却是其生活的社會環境。醫生和娼妓的希望不同，電影明星和賣豆腐姑娘的希望差異，軍閥貪官污吏和老百姓的希望衝突，···其原因都在於他們的生活環境不一樣這一點上。所以一個人的絶望自殺，實在是其所生活的社會所産生的；因抵抗不過經濟壓迫而自殺的，自然是由於其所生活的社會不能給與以經濟上的相對滿足所致；感於國家前途無望而自殺的，更是與其所生活的社會有不可分離的關係；就是因失戀而自殺的青年男女，也是因爲他們在其所生活的社會中，覺得别的一切都無偉大的意義，形成了一種以愛情爲人生第一義的觀念，所以一旦失戀，便覺一切都完了，宇宙，人生都没有絲毫意義，只有自殺；·······。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以說，某一國家或某一社會，如其自殺的人數越多，就越是證明了這一社會的病態之嚴重，越是證明了它不能爲大多數人滿意，以致使得許多人感到失望而自殺。目前的中國，不僅是自殺者日益增加，而且自殺者的範圍還在擴大，現在已由苦力，商人，娼妓擴大到詩人，電影明星中去了。前者有詩人朱湘的投水，目前又有電影明星艾霞之服毒，這些驚人的事實是充分說明了目前的中國社會是在怎樣地摧殘着許多人的生命，其病根已深到怎樣的程度了。</p>
<p>然而，自殺的原因雖在於社會的病態，但自殺的辦法却不是英勇的表現，自殺者實在是怯懦者。如果目前中國病態的社會産生了許多自殺的悲劇，那麽，在這下面的許多人之自殺，都是他們不能抵抗這社會的進攻之怯懦的表現！</p>

<h3 id="c266">我們的作家 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 淪流</p>
<p>我們的作者翻開大雜誌的投稿簡章，很興奮地看了一看。</p>
<p>「每天三塊錢！一萬三十塊了！」</p>
<p>於是，他就開始抽出筆來。寫字還得用墨水，我們的作者又在桌底尋出一瓶積着灰污的民生牌藍墨水。可是瓶裏却已空空了。我們的作者駡了口「他媽的」後，從破西裝袋裏檢出二角大洋，一面又跑出了他的亭子間。接着，他又跑回來拿起熱水瓶走了，他輕輕地說··　　「要做好稿子··身體快樂些，賺錢，···這是本錢。」</p>
<p>我們的作者從老虎灶泡了水出來，現在，他又想起要做什麽文章好，他不知不覺又回到他的亭子間。墨水有了，茶也有了，但門角裏却伸進來一個光秃頭。我們的作家皺了一次眉，可是他又意識到這頭是有力量的，是房東討錢的面孔，他只得立起身來。那光秃頭先開了口··</p>
<p>「喂！——房錢二月不曾付，我們不是喝西風。不然，大家面子難看了。你是讀書人，···」</p>
<p>他說不出話，其實，他還打算盤，做一萬五千字吧！今天寄，後天收到，或許編輯看我好，明天，後天就有回音，於是他就說話有些硬骨頭··</p>
<p>「今天七號，十號一定還清，十六塊錢，不少你一隻銅板！」</p>
<p>這樣，房東就開始朝外滾，他把門關了。</p>
<p>「好，看你到十號。···」下面的話聽不清楚。管他的，我們的作家趕快寫稿子，免得生島氣了！</p>
<p>隔壁，忽然開了無綫電，三燈機—聲音够噪雜了。而且有幾個不知趣的女人在狂笑。</p>
<p>「··搖搖··寳貝··要··睡覺。」</p>
<p>我們的作者丢下了筆，抽根香烟，把空包丢了。他又停止了應做什麽小說，開始駡起來··</p>
<p>「這種明星，嘿，不要臉。還——播什麽音！··」</p>
<p>他要駡下去，隔壁無綫電又轉高了，聲音更有些難聽。</p>
<p>「···我的寳，我的寳···」</p>
<p>那些女人，也同時把嗓子變得尖，是一種要把人汗毛豎直的聲音，一會兒，又狂笑了。</p>
<p>我們的作家嘆口氣，恨恨的溜出了亭子間。他在桌上一拍，重重地說··</p>
<p>「——找材料去！」臨時他又拿了本大雜誌。</p>
<p>夜深，化十五個銅板吃碗光麵，我們的作家又回到亭子間來。現在，他已帶着一身濁重的疲倦，什麽都不管，　一交再說，要睏，是文人的天性。我們的作家呼呼地睡着了。</p>
<p>明天，日歷上寫着「八」字。我們的作家洗好了從老虎灶泡來的臉水，呷着茶，提起筆來。可是昨天做了半天「馬浪蕩」，蕩不出什麽好材料，好做小說投稿，這裏面，我們的作家可以拿着十六塊錢在桌上一丢，那房東連話都不說十分重地接去了，這是多麽地威嚴呀—這樣，我們的作家，又在剛舖正的稿子上把筆作個手勢。</p>
<p>「現在，文章要握住現化性了。還是寫戰爭的小說！」但是，我們的作家，没有見個戰爭的事情，上海打仗，我們的作家也逃到家去過一個年。所以他又想用另一種材料做文章了。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「文章大衆化，—最新式，普羅文學···」他又想到描寫農村崩潰的背景</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>我們的作家在稿紙第一行寫了「秋收」二字，他又想到這題材太普遍了，於是他就立刻把牠撕得粉碎。這時候他的腦子裏又想起房錢來，身邊只有一隻袁頭。</p>
<p>結果，我們的作家寫成了一篇「年關」。他描寫一個農人的苦痛，寫農村破産中過的年關，雖然他不懂農人年關究竟是怎麽難過，他却很得意地打了個呵欠，寫壞二隻筆頭。這是一萬四千字四十塊錢的本錢。日子已是九號了，明天，得付清前天的硬話。於是我們的作家很機警地寫給編輯先生一封信，說是後天得動身到杭州去，酬資請卽日寄下。他又親自到郵局貼上了郵資，雙掛號！</p>
<p>十號，我們的作家一睜開眼，時候已是十一點了，亭子間推進一個人，他想··</p>
<p>「送稿費的來了嗎？」</p>
<p>但是——一隻秃頭，二隻眼有勁的望他　。</p>
<p>「哈！今天讓我到姓李的朋友地方拿錢去。···」</p>
<p>那秃頭說不出話，只慢慢地吞出一句話就去了，這話是含着一半譏諷，一半希望的陰陽話，聲音好像没有散··</p>
<p>「看你不失信！」</p>
<p>我們的作家跳下了床，翻箱子没有東西當，就出外去了。他没有離開他亭子間的左右，他怕送稿費的送錯了門牌。直到下午方才瞧見郵差來敲門，我們的作家心沸騰了。他趕快跑到郵差站着的門口，看見大大的一卷，他說不出話，只嚷着··「交給我，交給我。」</p>
<p>當我們的作家接到原璧奉還的他大作時，他灰心了。他不拆這卷退稿。他直是嚷··「····介紹新作品，騙人，他媽的，直和老子尋開心。」</p>
<p>他在這裏没有親戚，只有幾個窮朋友，也操投稿生意的。我們的作家現在向没有目的路上跑，秃頭的陰陽話還没有散··</p>
<p>「看··你··不··失信！」</p>
<p>這，我們的作家顧不到了，以後，他没有回到亭子間過。</p>

<h3 id="c267">英國之軍擴熱 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 青林</p>
<p>據英國飛機工業的言論機關「飛機」所載，去年（一九三三年）一年中，英國各飛機製造廠都獲利甚豐。以專製造軍用飛機著名的飛來航空公司（ＦＡＩＲＥＹＡＶＩＡＴＩＯＮＣＯ）在一九三三年增加了百分之十二又五的利潤。專替英國軍用飛機製造馬達的羅爾斯公司（ＲＯＬＬＳＲＯＹＣＥＣＯ）所增加的利潤爲百分之五又五。英國的飛機産額在去年也增大了。好克機械公司（ＨＧＨＡＷＫＥＲＥＮＧＩＮＥＥＲＩＮＧＣＯ）最近且設了新公司來經營這欣欣向榮的營業。而據該公司老板斯潑利格君（ＭＲＳＰＣＩＧＧ）所說··去年一年中所産的飛機數量，打破了戰後幾年來的紀錄。英國飛機工業之所以能在這百業凋敝的年頭特别繁榮，原因自然是在於英國的狂熱擴充軍備。去年英國的空軍支出爲一千七百四二十萬六千鎊，支出於陸軍的三千七百九十五萬鎊（比一九三二年增一百四十六萬二千鎊），海軍支出五千三百三十七萬鎊（比一九三二年增三百萬鎊）。</p>
<p>英國對於以無綫電駕御飛機的試騐也屢在進行。據謂有幾種這方面的發明已秘密獲得了專利。前年維克司（ＶＩＣＫＥＲＳＡＲＩＮＳＴＴＯＮＧ）獲得了新式的飛機用的槍，放炸彈與擲炸彈的機器等的專利。而去年幾種關於高射砲，機關槍的發明也得了專利。</p>
<p>最近英國騎兵團改編爲坦克兵團，而原有的幾營坦克兵的載鬥力都加强了，鐵甲車兵團也已重新編練過。總之，英國的軍隊機械化三年計劃着着在進行，每年都有新的完成。</p>
<p>英國在化學戰爭的凖備上也不遺餘力。在軍事當局與特聘的化學專家們主持之下，軍事化學的研究在進行着。在其最近的成績中，重要的有完備的防毒面具與一種新的毒瓦斯。自然，英國政府去年在這「科學事業」上化了十萬五千鎊的錢不會没有代價的。</p>
<p>此外，在海陸空軍備上的種種試騐也經常在舉行。去年英國化於海軍試騐上的錢爲七十五萬八千鎊，陸軍試騐六十一萬五千鎊，空軍的一百三十八萬五千鎊。</p>
<p>可是，英國的言論界還不以此種狂熱軍備擴張爲已足，它們還時常歇斯脫里地訴說英國軍備之不足。每日郵報（ＤＡＩＬＹＭＡＩＬ）甚至列舉數字，指摘英國在空軍上，在列强中僅列第五，而主張立卽建造飛機三千架。去年保守黨（現在英國的政府黨）年會上，也已通過了贊成這主張的議案。</p>
<p>看來，英國飛機工廠今年又有筆好賺頭，是無疑的。（據英國世界語通訊所載）</p>
<h3 id="c268">飄泊的女兒 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 珠女士</p>
<p>這不是時代狂流的漩渦，也不是歷史上起的風波；這是茫茫人海中</p>
<p>頃刻卽歸消逝的一個小小的泡沫。那不值得的回憶，也不值得的嘆息；可恨它常常在我的心中記起！　　在歷史的車輪轉輾之下，十八世紀將要死亡的那一年，是一個大荒年。那時，上好的白米，不過賣的五千錢一担，豆腐乾還是兩個小錢一塊，然而餓死人的消息，已不算什麽一回事了。就在那時候，我母親落在我父親的家裏。雖然父親是這樣慈祥和善的人，和那個前十年死去的母親！就是所謂嫡母，也同樣的温柔和藹；但，無疑的，我母親過的是牛馬奴隸的生活了。在封建社會的舊家庭裏生活着的我的母親，繼續着的前後三十年之中，居然負着一家的勞役和生活的重担，可是，在人們的眼裏，所謂「人」的領域中，是没有母親的地位的。雖然她會做工，生育，她是被看做家庭中的一架活的肉機器；她不能算是社會中之一員。這樣的見解，不祇是在過去的社會成爲「金科玉律」，就是在今日，在法律上還有着它明文的根據呵！母親「人」的資格究竟何處去獲得呀？我不禁爲母親呼寃，爲在舊社會裏成千成萬的被壓迫婦女呐一聲喊！</p>
<p>不料，我只呐喊了這麽一聲，我便不得不離開母親又是六年了。</p>
<p>快兩年已没有母親的消息了，不消說人間最偉大的慈母之愛無從消受，連母親往常所能給予我差以自慰的起居消息也無從接納；人生最大的損失和痛心，孰有逾於此呢？我心靈的上帝呵！爲我的母親祝福吧！世界上千千萬萬遠離了慈母的人們呵，我們爲人間的母親祝福吧！</p>
<p>記得一九三一年的嚴冬，從故鄉寄來母親的信，有這樣的一段··</p>
<p>「···自汝去後，誹謗叢集余身。族人不直汝所爲，牽連恨我，復落井下石，多方欺騙，利誘，威脅；企圖覇佔汝父遺業。余年老無力，汝又無兄弟，孑然孤苦，難與爭持。際茲天寒歲暮，余生活無依，勢成餓殍。不得已，决放棄一切，卽日離鄉往汝舅家，以了此殘生。爾前程遠大，望勿念我風中殘燭，自戕身體；幸而···」</p>
<p>當時我讀了這封信，淚涔涔下，心腸千碎萬斷，幾乎昏厥過去；那時的痛心，憤恨，眞是不可形容。想來我的眼淚幾乎爲這次流盡了，所以兩年來我雖也想到她而心兒酸痛，更遇着顚連的困苦甚至有時想自殺，然而我究竟没有再流過淚。</p>
<p>我是没有固定的住址，舅家是個不通郵的鄉村；故鄉雖有所謂親戚朋友之類，然而他們都是把我當成叛逆的仇人一樣的看待；這樣，母親的消息，竟如沉没於大海的孤舟一般，使我無從去探測。</p>
<p>本來，母親的一切苦况，是現社會制度所賜予的，罪過自然不應由我去負責；可是，現在她「勢成餓殍」，我又可以說不應負責嗎？這是何等痛心呵！但，又有什麽辦法呢？我想，世界上無數的母親，在這種社會制度之下，要是她們兒女不肯出賣靈魂又不能在别人身上剝削些血汗下來的話，難道眞能够去「臥冰求鯉」或「哭竹生筍」來孝敬母親嗎？這些事縱是可能；他們的母親也决不會讓她們的兒女去做的吧？</p>
<p>窮人的母親之心是如何的空虚又如何的酸痛啊！</p>
<p>我思念起母親，我就咀咒舊社會；牠不單使千千萬萬人挨飢受餓，連人間最寳貴的父子和母女間的親愛也給牠毁滅無遺了。</p>
<p>「故鄉雖好不思歸」這眞道破了我的肺腑。其實，不要說故鄉是没有什麽值得留戀，在這世界上除了我憧憬着的那一片淨土以外，又那裏有我立足的地方？這裏，我不禁悵然憶起楊騷的詩句··</p>
<p>「我心悠悠，我不知所之，我不知所留？</p>
<p>趁我年還青，我就盡力地飄泊；如我生得老，我就死！！死在天地心！」</p>

<h3 id="c269">瓶上撥水 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 白鵝</p>
<p>這是一個合於物理的遊戲，不過方法很是簡便，原理也很容易明瞭。</p>
<p>方法··用一隻白色的玻璃瓶，裏面盛了一小半的水，放在有鹽水的鍋子裏燃燒。等鍋子裏的水沸了，瓶裏的水接着也沸了以後，蓋上塞子，將瓶取去，平放在桌子上（這時候水不沸了）。然後，取冷水一杯，潑在瓶上，於是瓶内的水又沸了。再潑一杯，同樣的又沸騰起來了。</p>
<p>理由··尋常瓶子裏的水，放在淡水裏燃燒，瓶裏的水是不會沸騰的；放了鹽以後，鹽水的熱度就依着鹽的多寡而高出一百度以上，因此，瓶裏的水也沸了。沸了以後，瓶内的空氣完全給水蒸氣排斥盡了，因爲不要空氣再進去，所以將蓋蓋上。潑了冷水以後，瓶内的水蒸氣就凝成水點，因此，瓶裏水的上面，没有了通常的大氣壓力。因爲水面的壓力越低，水的沸點也越低，所以雖不再加火，水重新又沸起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c270">歐洲問題和太平洋問題 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 楊文茲</p>
<p>一九一四　一九二八年的第一次世界大戰之後，帝國主一義列强重新分割了世界，在歐洲是凡爾賽和平會議的條約；在美洲是華盛頓會議的恊定。但這兩個國際會議所造成的局勢，在今天，是已經陳舊了，已經與帝國主義列强之間的對比力量不相符合了。因爲資本主義發展的不平衡的公律，在歐戰之後特别有力的表現出牠的作用。不平衡發展的形勢，非常明顯的表現在資本主義總危機的時代之中。而在總危機的第三時期的今日—全世界經濟恐慌的深入，更加强了不平衡發展的力量。資本主義相對穩定的時期已終結了。巨大的互相衝突的力量儘量的在發展着，目前的世界已迫近戰爭的大門。用戰爭來重新分割世界，是帝國主義列强當前的問題了。　現在試概略的說一說帝國主義間衝突的主要焦點。</p>
<p>歐洲問題　德國法西斯蒂的暫時勝利，更促進了武力衝突的危機。戰爭的導火綫已經在燃燒了。法西斯蒂德國要求修改凡爾賽條約。牠要求將但澤（波蘭的走廊），薩爾交還給牠。這走廊問題隨時都可以引起戰爭的爆發的，因爲法國（波蘭事實上的主人）是不輕易容許聽國在西歐方面又得到一個新的而且是經濟上的重要區域的海口。</p>
<p>同時，奥國問題也是修改凡爾賽條約的最重要問題之一。德國法西斯蒂公開的要求着「德奥合併」。因爲如果德奥合併了，則德帝國主義就可以伸手攫取巴爾幹半島，以及近東土耳其等的勢力範圍，把捷克斯拉夫三面包圍起來，而提起捷克國内的三百萬德人歸併到德國去的問題，並且還可將匈牙利放在自己的影響下。德奥合併可以有兩種方式··一種是公開的合併；另一種是「一致化」的合併，卽希特勒派的國社黨在奥國取得政權。可是這些計劃，不但法國的資産階級認爲德奥合併是「新的戰爭的導火綫」，而且法西斯蒂意大利也是反對的。固然意大利在其他問題上是聯合德國的，但在這件事情上，牠是要反對，要破壞德國的計畫的。最近意奥匈三國會議，就是意大利所玩的把戲之一。　　但奥國問題，實際上祇是多瑙河問題的一部份。意大利想將奥國及匈牙利合併，而且如果可能，還想合併南斯拉夫的霍爾瓦提亞，而將這些地方都放在自己的領導之下。法國想將奥國及匈牙利歸到小恊約國裏去，造成「多瑙河聯邦」。而匈牙利要求修改特里安納條約，割取南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞及捷克斯拉夫的一些領土。意大利贊助匈牙利這一計畫，但這三個小恊約國，倚着法國的勢力，是不肯讓步的。</p>
<p>多瑙河問題與巴爾幹問題，是密切的聯系着。意大利要想分割南斯拉夫，將霍爾瓦提亞割去，奪取達爾馬地亞（亞得里亞海岸的羣島）而將亞得里亞海變成意大利的「裏海」。同時、意大利還要解决巴爾幹半島上多年的爭論問題，南斯拉夫，保加利亞及希臘之間的衝突問題—亞爾巴尼亞問題。意大利是主張將亞爾巴尼亞交給保加利亞及希臘。</p>
<p>德國與波蘭之爭執但澤以及上西里西亞，實際上是德國與法國的衝突。同樣意大利與南斯拉夫之間的爭執，實際上是意大利與法國的衝突。後者之間的衝突，還有北菲洲問題。法意都爭奪着地中海的領導權，爭奪着薩奥伊與尼司以及近東方面的勢力範圍。</p>
<p>帝國主義列强都在瘋狂的武裝着，凖備着新的帝國主義戰爭，來解决他們之間的衝突。但同時，帝國主義者也企圖將正在凖備着的武裝，用來進攻蘇聯，以緩和帝國主義相互間的矛盾。如德奥合併問題，因法意的反對，德國法西斯蒂的外交部半官報就公開發表「統一烏克蘭」的主張，因爲烏克蘭的領土有一部份是屬於蘇聯烏克蘭共和國的。而英帝國主義，在遠東政策上是暗中贊助日本併吞滿蒙的；而在歐洲政策上，是贊助德國反蘇聯的急進主張。事實上，英帝國主義目前已代替了法帝國主義的地位，成爲反蘇聯戰爭主要的組織者了。　　太平洋問題　太平洋上，帝國主義分割中國是已經在進行中。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義已經佔領了東三省，熱河及察哈爾的一部份，並且還在繼續侵略到平津一帶及凖備侵略外蒙。在爲德國所代管的加羅林與小笠原羣島上，日本建築了新的海軍根據地。日本還企圖造成迪化一帶民族的「東干國」。</p>
<p>英帝國主義也在侵略着中國。華南是英帝國主義的勢力範圍。牠更掌握西藏西康而來攫取四川。不久以前新疆南部獨立，就是英帝國主義所操縱的。</p>
<p>法帝國主義經過安南，貫穿雲南，貴州而在四川南部活動着。最近報載英兵入滇，就是英帝國主義向法帝國主義的示威。</p>
<p>美帝國主義已經借了五千萬美金的棉麥借欵等給中國。</p>
<p>因了帝國主義分割中國而引起了衝突，太平洋上的海軍競賽就異常的緊張起來。但海軍競賽緊張的主要原因，還是爲着進攻中國，對付蘇聯。美國已通過了擴大海軍的議案—海軍經費增加到一·○○○·○○○·○○○美金、並决定在大西洋及太平洋上各建築兩個海軍根據地，還要「測量」阿魯甲島。英國也通過了海軍預算五六·五五○·○○○鎊—較去年增多二·九八○·○○○鎊、並趕築新加坡海軍根據地及收買鐵木耳島。法國也佔領了中國南海的九小島，而加緊建築軍事工程。日本也通過了海軍第二次補充計畫的預算。</p>
<p>日本在中國的軍事行動，南美洲諸小國間的戰爭，就是卽將到臨的新的世界大戰的前奏曲！</p>

<h3 id="c271">讀「小學自然科詞書」以後 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>申報五日廣告，載有商務印書館出版的「小學自然科詞書」，我喜不自勝，因爲這一類綜合的辭典，可說是空前僅有的一部書，馬上往棋盤街　了一部，回來在怱忙約略翻閱一過，我失望得什麽似的，茲寫些出來告訴大家。</p>
<p>（一）内容　雜。本書名爲自然科詞書，當然是一部專門的詞書，不應收集許多非自然科學的名詞來充數，我們看牠的分類索引中，分到二十三類，就可見牠的　雜不純，尤可笑者，把「游戲」一類也列入其中。</p>
<p>（二）編次顚倒。目次第四面中，忽列入「芫」字，按「芫」字係八畫不應列入九畫，尤不應將「六○三」面之數字，無故揷入「三九六」之下，細查正文而「芫」字竟排入十一畫之中，此非編次顚倒而何？</p>
<p>（三）分類不確。分類索引第二十面「化學工業」類中，有「雅片」，二十一面又有「雅片」，細查正文「七四二」面有「雅片」，「九七五」面有雅片，此係重複，固無傷太雅，唯同類同面中尙有「雲」一條，則百思不得其解，豈該詞書有巧奪天工之本領，能够用「化學工業」而造成「雲」嗎？</p>
<p>（四）取材不當。本書取材不當，有的極關重要之名詞，竟付闕如，而與自然科學不甚相關之「硯」「筆」（見七零三，七零五面），反採列書中，頗爲不當，且該兩條名詞下之註解，純粹注重歷史的叙述，毫無科學的解釋。</p>
<p>（五）校對不精。詞書首重精確，若訛誤百出，不但無益，而且有害，本書校對不精，錯字時見，尤爲缺點。</p>
<p>總之，本書係粗製濫造的産品，分量雖多，實質甚劣。「化學部分」名詞，僅二百餘條，其他可見。記者頗望該館能維持牠歷史的光榮，以本書爲殷鑒，以後出書對於實質方面多多注意，不但利，抑且利己，未知該館當局以爲如何？</p>

<p>近來本市的减租運動，已普遍地風捲雲湧般開展了。這運動發生的必然性和重要性，早有許多明達之士談論過，無容我來添蛇脚。不過，我對於這運動的本身，總感到有點缺陷似的，這就是没有看到有那一弄堂的住亭子間的人有組織地參加過。</p>
<p>難道是住亭子間的人不需要减租嗎？不是的！所謂住亭子間的人，大概包括店員，工人等等工銀勞働者，以及失業失學的各羣。他們的收入都很菲薄，甚至毫無收入。世界經濟恐慌和帝國主義的傾銷，雖然使全上海的商業陷於彫零，經濟淪於破産，然而，最受痛苦的可以說只有這些亭子間裏的人物。商店工廠的關閉的危險愈深入，他們的失業恐慌就愈大，眞正因無錢付租金而受到房東的冷酷待遇，常見到的也便是他們那些人物。這樣，在减租運動中，顯然地他們不僅是要踴躍參加而且應該成爲運動中的前鋒。</p>
<p>那末，到底爲什麽没有他們參加呢？</p>
<p>我認爲這是由於兩種錯誤的觀念促成的··在住亭子間的人方面總以爲自己力量太小，無權過問，好像這只是二房東與大房東和地主的直接交涉，而且帶有「等待」的意味—等待運動有結果，自己坐享其成。另外，在二房東方面，也是以爲那些人無大緊要，他們之參加與不參加，與自己無關，甚至與己有利，於是便把他們抛棄了。</p>
<p>爲了整個運動的前途，爲了各個的本身利益（無論二房東或住亭子間的人），這兩種觀念，都應該馬上加以糾正。在减租的總目的下，二房東與住亭子間的人是絲毫没有利益上的衝突的。有一致的要求，自然要有一致的行動。只顧自己的利益而不顧别人的利益固然要不得，卽等候别人做好而自己不動，也同樣要不得，結果必然要失望。至於力量，更不待言。試問住亭子間的人旣更痛苦於二房東，住亭子間的人的數量又豈在二房東之下？</p>

<p>— 且女士</p>
<p>「生的過程」是一串殘酷的連續不斷的戰爭，而整個的「人生」就是一片遼闊的大戰塲。</p>
<p>每天，每天，「生活」在對人作猛烈的進襲，永無停歇的時候。「生活」是一位偉大的軍事家，牠採取的是一種攻守兼施的戰略，運用的是一種前後夾攻的戰術。在人的前面牠設有三條堅固的防綫，第一條呌做「死綫」，還有兩條就是「飢餓綫」和「寒冷綫」，壁壘森嚴，佈置週密，以防人的反攻，這一方面牠取的是守勢。另一方面，牠又派遣幾員勇悍善戰的將帥，率領大隊人馬，浩浩蕩蕩的分「衣」「食」「住」三路並進，向人的背後壓迫着，威脅着，這一方面牠取的是攻勢。這樣，人就成了甕中之鼈，全個兒被「生活」的重兵所包圍住了！</p>
<p>不過，這裏也有一個例外。對於那些少數的幸運兒，「生活」是不敢加以侵犯的，因爲那些幸運兒，他們並不畏懼「生活」，迥避「生活」。他們怕什麽呢！他們有金錢作武器，有財寳爲後盾，洋房是抵抗「生活」的萬里長城，田地是他們作戰的根據地，匯票像檄文似的傳遍世界，支票如戰書般的在街頭亂飛着，「生活」根本不是他們的對手，他們無須與「生活」爲敵，也無須爲「生活」的逼迫而憂慮；而且，實在他們也需要「生活」，他們歡迎牠，喜愛牠，更不惜用大量的金錢去供給牠，滿足牠，使牠達到享樂的最高度。至於「生活」自己呢，你要知道牠不但是軍事家，而且還是一個陰</p>
<p>謀家，牠是欺弱扶强，抑貧濟富的。只要「生活」自身的慾望塡滿了，而且盈溢了，超過需要之外了，試問牠又何必去迫害他們呢？</p>
<p>可是，在其餘大多數的人看來，「生活」這位英雄却眞是太可怕了—牠頭戴貝胄，身披鎧甲，腰懸寳刀，手握丈八長槍，滿臉殺氣騰騰，一身威武懍懍。你越是想落荒而走，牠却越是緊追着你，甚至遇到那些剛和「生活」接觸的五六歲拾荒的小孩，牠也一馬當先，如臨大敵，更抖擻精神，揚鞭大呼道··「當首大將乃「生活」也，看你們誰敢來送死！」殘酷的戰爭就這樣的開始了！</p>
<p>許許多多的人是在亂箭中被「生活」所射死了，但仍有許許多多的人在浴血奮戰，進行着長期的抗爭。他們背後爲「衣」「食」「住」三路大軍所驅迫，没有别的辦法，只有往前衝，想衝破前面那可怕的「死綫」，殺出一條生路來，他們有的人使盡　所有的力量　纔得越過這第一條防綫，進面向「飢餓綫」和寒冷綫」上掙扎着更進而戰勝「生活」，竟復「生活」，但一面仍須隨時提防着「生活」的捲土重來。還有一些人呢，他們可是失敗了，因爲他們的環境太困難了。他們遭了「窮困」的暗算；當他們與「生活」相搏戰時，「窮困」却勾結「生活」，和「生活」站在同一戰綫上，而與他們爲敵。這樣，他們有的卽使暫時戰勝了「生活」，但結果仍爲牠所擊退了；有的是永遠停留在「死綫」上，永遠停留在「飢餓綫」和「寒冷綫」上，與「生活」相持不下；也有的終於做了「生活」的俘虜，爲牠所迫害而犧牲了，而這樣的人又何止千百萬呢！眞的，「生活」原是最殘忍不過的。牠是個騙子，牠是名不符實的，牠只有一個漂亮的空洞的口號；牠的旗幟上明明寫的是「生活」兩個大字，但牠所留給人們的却往往只有死路一條！</p>
<p>社會一天天的不景氣，經濟恐慌一天天的加深，於是「生活」的防綫也就愈益築得堅固，「生活」的璧壘也就愈益加高增厚，而「生活」猛烈的火力的射擊也就愈益向人集中。一個苦惱的人若要想掙脫牠的重圍，躱避牠的鋒芒，眞是談何容易！</p>

<h3 id="c276">達爾文（五） <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 几凡</p>
<p>在寫完達爾文的學說以後，這篇略傳也就寫到最後的一節了。然而，這位巨人的後半生的日常生活我們却不能不略爲提及，否則，我們對於這位科學者的生活紀述還是會有遺恨的。</p>
<p>「他是一個非凡的科學者，但他的日常生活是很平常　的。」這是他的一位友人對探訪達氏的人常常道及的。不錯—日常生活總是受着當時環境所决定的，不見得一個「天才」會有一種超乎常人的生活。譬如達氏的少年時代的生活，據我們看來，雖然也流露了他的才智，但總不過是一般少年生活的典型，並無特異的地方。晚年的達氏更因身體的不健，頗影響到他的工作。他實在飽受　人生各方面——苦痛快樂——的味兒，他是實實在在在生活中奮鬥過了的一個勇敢的戰士。</p>
<p>但是，同一時代下活着的人們的生活，自然不免略具同一色彩，這就是生活的一般性罷！但每一個小我，也常常多多少少有些不同的地方，這也是事實，是因爲受個人生活的特殊限制的緣故。這也就是名人軼事的泉源了。　　達氏之家庭生活，至爲美滿，對於妻子，亦盡其温柔仁愛。他在「情感之表示」一書中，描述了他對子女的注意，周到備至。他說道，當小兒啼泣時，他愛看兒童啼泣時的表情，但又每每被軟化了，不等兒童啼畢就慰吻無已。他嘗側身兒童間，作爲忌年侣伴，兒童亦不以老人待他，共相游戲，以爲娛樂。他對兒女終生未出過怒言，對於僕人亦拘拘於禮。性甚好客，極盡賓主情義，常環坐暢談，惟恐不能盡歡。朋友中赫胥黎以健談著名，達氏極愛聞其趣語；萊勒，虎克則多討論科學，每至互相爭辯，没有結論。然而，達氏在回憶錄中說··「我所交的朋友中，最可愛殆未有過於虎克的人」，可見他們感情之深邃」</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>達氏愛美術，但手遲笨不能作圖畫··好音樂，但耳不靈活不辨其音律。這大概是巨人特有的缺項罷—他的生活，在晚年是很有規律的。起居坐臥，都有一定的時間。但在飲食方面，有時仍保有少年時代的天眞。他極愛甜食，醫生常常禁止，家人亦不多備，但他總不能改變。</p>
<p>「達爾文的黃色小簿」爲倫敦圖書館珍藏之一，爲研究達氏生活者的寳物，但是，在達氏生前，這些小册子是經常置放在一個火罏横板上的。那就是多年達氏的日記，堆集在一起。其中紀事以工作爲主體，如某日工作，某日因病，不能工作，甚詳。由此可知他對疾病是非常憎恨的。以外，關於出游及還家日記，亦紀錄甚詳。當他數夜失眠，頭腦發暈，妻勸他出游數日，他總不願聽允，或則與妻爭論日期，卽令講明七日始歸，他總於先一二日卽返。他到晚年，惜時至此。就在這裏，我們亦可看出，如果他没有疾病苦惱，他的學問上的成功，或更要超過已達到的限度也說不定。</p>
<p>他的惜時的另一方法是「一事不作第二次」。他說，譬如許多實騐，屢次行之，不如注意周到，一次做好，其費力方不至於虚費。所以他對每一微小實騐，動輒視爲神聖，蓋不肯白花時間的緣故。這一點，很值得我們注意。</p>
<p>他還有一種惜陰法，卽工作要達其力量所能及的界限，「我以爲當停止於此—」則止，否則决不罷休；並極注意工作進度及强度，更常保有工作之愉快與興趣，在他極端忙迫時，每每自語道··「我乃出於愉快，而非出於勉强啊！」　　至於他的工作精神，更是非常人可及。他對於人家認爲是例外，微細的事，他却反視它爲神聖，决不輕易放過。第二，是他的固執。這固執是他對於眞理發現而言。他到老還是那般愛讀書，實騐，和對自己的警惕。</p>
<p>總之··他是一生在奮鬥中，在獲得眞理的追求中生而死。</p>
<p>我們接受了他的學說，景仰他偉大的人格，我們應繼續他的研究，更接近我們所要追求的眞理。（完）</p>

<p>Jinsui Army's Vanguard Reaches Dengkou</p>
<p>Sun's Army Fiercely Attacks Pingluo for Days</p>
<p>(Beiping) Baotou Telegram: After the Jinsui Army began its offensive against Sun's army on the 11th, progress has been rapid. In addition to the defection of Peng Zhenguo's brigade of Sun's forces, the Bulun淖 Sansheng Temple has been occupied successively. It is now actively advancing westward. Dengkou can be taken within days. Fu Zuoyi marched into Linhe on the morning of the 17th to command. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Baotou Telegram: Fu's army occupied Sansheng Temple on the afternoon of the 15th and is pursuing towards Dengkou, capturing many prisoners. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ji Yiqiao and Hu Yukun visited He Yingqin this afternoon to discuss resolving the Sun's army problem. They discussed it for a long time. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Jinsui Army actively advanced westward, it made several contacts with Sun's forces and occupied Sansheng Temple, Tianxingquan and other places. It is now tracking and pursuing. Most of Sun's troops are exhausted and unable to fight again. It is expected that the military situation can be brought to an end in the near future. Regarding the issue of Sun leaving the army, there has been no reply to Ping from Fu Zhan Kui after the square telegram. The funds that Sun requested to be returned are the expenses for clothing and tents custom-made for the various PingSui armies. The authorities only need Sun to leave the army, and everything is not a problem. The arrears can be paid by the military branch. However, the area near Ningyuan is still occupied by Sun's army. There have been fierce battles in Pingluo for days. Because Sun's attack on Ningyuan suffered heavy losses and failed, he has changed his strategy and turned to take Pingluo in order to eliminate his worries, so he spared no effort to attack. The authorities have ordered the encircling and suppressing troops to advance and pressure according to the planned plan, in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Ping on the 17th reporting that Sun Dianying's army, led by Sun Ziyu, has been fiercely attacking Pingluo for days, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties. Yu Shiming recently, because Sun intends to leave the army, invited people to Ningxia to negotiate surrender, and there is a possibility of compromise. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jinsui Army has arrived at Sansheng Temple, and the main force has ordered to continue the westward advance. Fu Zuoyi telegraphed He Yingqin to report the military victory, and said that Zhao Chengshou and Wang Jingguo have set off to the front to supervise the army's fierce advance, and it is expected that Dengkou can be taken within three or two days. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The campaign against Sun's army has made rapid progress in recent days. After the Jinsui Army recovered Sansheng Temple, its vanguard has arrived at Dengkou. Sun's army is disorganized, and various units have rebelled, so many retreated without a fight. Sun himself, seeing himself surrounded on all sides and knowing that he is in a dead end, is willing to take this opportunity to leave the army. The arrears of pay and dismissal expenses he requested are prepared to subsidize his personal life after leaving the army. Because Sun is not sincere in leaving the army, the authorities cannot immediately agree to his request. According to observations from various parties, even if Sun refuses to obey the order to leave the army, the result will only be absconding. The military campaign against Sun can be concluded within days. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Suiyuan Telegram: Sun Dianying's army repeatedly attacked the city in Ningxia without success. The soldiers are old and exhausted, and it is difficult to fight again. At the same time, many subordinates have become disloyal due to insufficient supplies. This time, the Jinsui Army marched west and contacted Sun's army twice. Sun's exhausted soldiers could not withstand the sharpness of the new force, so they were defeated in both battles. Fu Zuoyi's army has passed Sansheng Temple and is advancing towards Dengkou, taking a liaison-style approach, with the goal of advancing to Ningxia. Although Sun's army is trying to make a final struggle, it can be resolved within two or three days. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Consul stationed in Zhangjiakou recently received instructions from the Japanese Embassy to visit Qin Dechun, the Director of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Government, to explain the Japanese military movements in eastern Chahar. Qin has telegraphed Song Zheyuan about the meeting with the Japanese Consul. Song is scheduled to return to Ping tomorrow. Xiao Zhenying visited He this morning to report the situation and is waiting for Song in Ping. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the situation in eastern Chahar recently, the headquarters of the Japanese 7th Division has moved to within the city of Duolun. About a regiment of Japanese troops has arrived in the 2nd and 4th districts of Guyuan. There are also two or three hundred soldiers with more than ten armored vehicles in the area east of the Heihe River to Xifengkou. The defense of Longmensuo is still the responsibility of our army. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Shuzi, the Ping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, telegraphed the commission saying that the Japanese have established a special agency director's office and a joint office of Chahar, Suiyuan and Mongolian banners in Duolun, and attached a real estate company, etc., in an attempt to instigate the Mongolian people and disperse the unity of the Mongolian ethnic group. Their intentions are vicious. The commission should order all Mongolian banners to reject the illegal Japanese agencies and all unreasonable demands, and also send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with Japan in order to maintain national sovereignty. As for the defense of eastern Chahar, the commission has also submitted a request to the central government to make appropriate plans to ensure safety. However, according to recent reports from all parties near Mongolia and Tibet, the illegal agencies established by the Japanese puppets in Duolun have been slightly reduced, but their ambition to invade Chahar has not diminished at all.

Because the merchants and residents were unaware of it beforehand, they were frightened by the sound of gunfire and closed their doors. The Japanese military drill ended at 4 pm. The drill resumed at night from 8 pm to 10 pm. Three armored vehicles were also dispatched at night. The sound of gunfire resonated far and wide. The merchants and residents were extremely panicked.

<p>(Beiping) The Diplomacy Monthly Society hosted Tang Youren at 5 pm on the 17th. More than 20 people attended. After Chairman Yang Zhuoran gave a speech, he asked Tang to give instructions on the work of the society. Tang immediately stood up and spoke, briefly saying that his opinion on the Northeast issue is that it is impossible to recover the four northeastern provinces by force, and it is also difficult to do so through diplomacy. Therefore, our main task now is how to make the people of the Northeast not forget that they are Chinese, because the decline of national consciousness is the most terrible thing. If the people of the Northeast cannot retain their ethnic consciousness, then there will be no way in the long run. Now foreigners are assimilating education in the Northeast. If we want to maintain the national consciousness of the people in the Northeast, we must do long-term work on "how to make the people of the Northeast not forget that they are Chinese." Once this kind of work is effective, the hearts of the people in the Northeast will rise up to show that they are Chinese. Therefore, in addition to investigating materials, your society must also pay attention to this. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Launching a Full-Scale Attack on Yangmeizhai</p>
<p>A Fierce Battle Lasts Four Days and Nights Resulting in a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>The Bandit Side Suffers 7,000-8,000 Casualties and Thousands of Guns are Seized</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The pseudo-military first, third, fifth, ninth, and twelfth corps and the security division of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province were defeated by the Central Army last time. Recently, after reorganization and replenishment, they again sneaked from Guangchang on the 10th to the Baishaping area west and south of Nanfeng, concentrating their forces to attack the position of the Central Northern Route Army. Starting from the morning of the 11th, the pseudo-first, third and ninth corps and part of the pseudo-fifth corps simultaneously attacked the positions of the Wuduzhai, Donghuashan, Shigushan, and Yanglindu, while another part detoured via Sanxiyu and Yangmeizhai to the right flank of the Central Army. Fierce fighting with the Third Route Army lasted all day, especially in Wuduzhai. After a fierce attack by the Central Army guards, they failed. At noon on the 13th, they again launched a fierce attack on the Yangmeizhai and Jialing positions. The Central Third Route Army launched counterattacks in several directions, and after four hours, the bandits were surrounded, unable to take care of each other from beginning to end, suffered heavy casualties, and collapsed to the southwest. On the 14th, the Central Army pursued and encircled and suppressed the various units in the area of Qiaotou, Ganfang, and Zhufang. In this bloody battle lasting four days and nights, the bandits suffered approximately 7,000-8,000 casualties, approximately 3,000 corpses were left on the battlefield, more than 2,000 bandit soldiers were captured alive, and thousands of guns were seized. The detailed number is still being investigated. The Central Army also suffered nearly 1,000 casualties. From now on, the bandit's courage has been broken, and it will be difficult to eliminate them as scheduled. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 囗 Army's 囗囗 Army and the 囗囗 two divisions, and the entire 1359 corps and the pseudo 12th Army's pseudo-independent division and independent regiment, etc., have been fighting fiercely in the line from Yangmeizhai southwest of Nanfeng and Sanxiyu Sanfang to Fulin渡 since the 11th day, with constant clashes and bloodshed. Until noon on the 13th, the National Army took advantage of the heavy rain to launch a full-scale attack, and the 囗囗 two divisions attacked the bandits' flanks from Shagang. The bandits were unable to take care of each other from beginning to end, and the entire line was shaken. The divisions rose up and pursued, killing more than 2,000 bandits, capturing 700-800, and seizing 600-700 machine guns and rifles. The bandits took advantage of the darkness to flee to the Ganfang and Qiacun areas, which was very embarrassing. On the 15th, the 囗囗 two divisions pursued to the vicinity of Baishe Liaopi圩, and again defeated the pseudo 14th and 13th divisions, definitely occupying Baishe Liaopi, seizing more than 100 machine guns and rifles, and capturing dozens of prisoners. According to reports, the remnants of the bandits are now fleeing towards Guangchang via Qiacun. It is found that the bandits regard Guangchang as their life zone, because the 囗 road army is advancing towards Guangchang step by step, they have to make a final struggle at their life-and-death juncture. Unexpectedly, they suffered an unprecedented tragic defeat, and the end is not far away. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Military Law Office of the Northern Route Headquarters shot Li Zhankui, a bandit spy who sneaked into Xishan to spy on military information, this morning. Xishan is located in the suburbs of Nanchang, and Kong Hechong's bandits once harassed it. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Repelled by the Zhejiang Security Regiment</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Red Bandit Fang Zhimin's troops, with three divisions and about 10,000 soldiers, concentrated at Zihukou on March 8 and sneaked into the Daqiaotou on the Zhejiang border, attempting to harass Wangban and Huabu. Jiang Zhiying, the acting commander of the Zhejiang Security Column, urgently dispatched a team to suppress them. The Red Bandits used a small number of troops to contain them in the front, and another 6,000-7,000 troops detoured to attack Changshan. After we transferred troops from three directions to encircle them, a fierce battle lasted for three hours. The bandits were defeated and retreated, and more than 300 were killed and a large number of weapons were seized. On the 10th, the bandits planned to attack Yushan, but knew that it was prepared, so they feigned an attack on Qiuchuan, attempting to occupy Yushan with their main force. They were still repelled by our army's joint efforts, and pursued to the north of Benkou. The bandits retreated and fled to Zhangshu. It is now reported that the bandits have returned to Ge Yuan Laojiao because they failed. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

The Yunnanese people in Beijing have scheduled an emergency meeting at 2 pm on the 18th to discuss countermeasures and contribute to the government. Although the government has started negotiations with the British, the British claim that their information differs greatly from our reports. Therefore, the government is considering sending personnel from the competent authorities or related agencies to the local area to investigate and use it as a basis for negotiations.

<p>(Nanjing) The Yunnanese Students Association in Beijing held a meeting at 4 pm on the 17th to discuss countermeasures to the British invasion of Ban Hong for mining. Resolutions were made on important cases: 1. Unite with Yunnanese people in Ping and Shanghai to jointly urge the government to demarcate the border as soon as possible. 2. Join the Yunnanese Association in Beijing to petition the government. 3. Compile and print materials on the Yunnan-Myanmar border affairs and the British's previous invasions of Yunnan to arouse national attention. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A responsible person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the British mining in Ban Hong, which belongs to Lancang County in Yunnan, has been happening for a long time. The Ministry has previously protested to the British. Later, the British government also replied, saying that the matter involves diplomacy and is not convenient to publish. They use the excuse that the area is an undetermined boundary to invade. Recently, Long, the chairman of Yunnan Province, has also sent border defense personnel to conduct on-site investigations and reported to the central government. The Ministry believes that the matter involves national border negotiations and plans to conduct preliminary negotiations after the British envoy returns to Nanjing, and then both parties will send personnel to survey and formally demarcate the boundary line to avoid future complications.

<p>To Strive for the New Life Movement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Guidance Committee for People's Movement issued a telegram on the 17th to arouse the people nationwide to practice the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The original telegram said, "All party headquarters and people's organizations in all provinces and cities are aware that the danger of our country's national situation and the decline of people's livelihood have reached their peak today. The foreign troubles and internal banditry are attacking from all sides, making it even more complicated. If we want to build our country and revive our nation, we must have the spirit of being born today and dying yesterday, and do the work of eliminating the old and introducing the new, and strive together to promote and push forward. There is no way to do this. The way of reform must be simple and effective. The key is to make the general public have the morals and knowledge of citizens, and then the society will have the hope of progress. And this kind of practical work should be improved at any time in the daily life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, in order to meet the requirements of modern citizens and to express their spirit of loving the country and being loyal to the nation. In other words, it conforms to the morality of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame inherent in our country. Whether it is living, resting, or eating, everything should conform to the rules. Therefore, in the sixth lecture of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the spittle and spit should be checked, and the fingernails and teeth should be cleaned. The matter is extremely small, just like the earnest admonitions of family fathers and sons, which is the initial effort of self-cultivation. In fact, sincerity shapes the outside, which is the expression of the intelligence and virtue of our nation, and its significance is extremely significant. This time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is launching the New Life Movement in Nanchang. The painstaking efforts of its advocacy and the essence of its exposition have been seen in its past speeches and newspaper propaganda. Summarizing its essence, it is that the people themselves reform their daily lives, develop habits of tidiness, cleanliness, simplicity, and frugality, and strive to conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and express the intelligence and morality of the citizens of modern civilized countries. Since the establishment of the New Life Movement Promotion Association in Nanchang, the response has been enthusiastic, sweeping the country for a while, which shows that this basic work of saving the country and seeking survival is urgently needed at this time, and is possessed by the hearts of the people. Our association has the responsibility of leading the national people's movement, and especially hopes to promote it together with the party headquarters and people's organizations at all levels, and to change the decadent customs. We must know that this New Life Movement is where the educational spirit of modern countries lies, and it is also inherent in the traditional spirit of our country. Given the low level of general public knowledge today, the bad social environment and general educational foundation, if we want to enable the people across the country to recognize the times and environment of the country and the nation in the shortest possible time, and to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens, and to work hard to save the country, build the country, revive the nation, and non-promoting this movement, no progress can be made. Those who are responsible for leading the people should especially straighten themselves and lead by example, cultivate themselves vigorously, work hard and endure hardships, advance bravely, practice frugality, and abstain from extravagance. In their daily life, when resting and responding, they should not forget to reform bad habits and set an example everywhere. Although daily life is very complicated, we cannot list details as standards. What is important is to stimulate vitality, wash away old dirt, act for the people, and at the same time go deep into the people and guide them according to the situation, so that customs can be changed and great results can be achieved. Our party headquarters and people's organizations at all levels, aware of the danger of the national and ethnic situation, and the great responsibility of building the country and reviving the nation, must abide by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of restoring national morality and intelligence, and work hard on the New Life Movement initiated by Chiang Kai-shek this time. This is what our association wants to sincerely promote and encourage each other, so we send this telegram, hoping that you will make efforts to practice and promote it, to meet our ardent expectations, very important, very important.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui telegraphed Jiang, presenting four proposals for governing Kangding and harmonizing Tibet: 1. The border of the Xikang region was originally based on 囗囗 (unclear telegraph code in the middle). The Baili campaign only recovered territory to the east bank of the Jinsha River. Recently, Tibetan forces have been stationed on the west bank, demanding land concessions. Their momentum is fierce. Thus, the undefined border is a major cause of discord between Kangding and Tibet. 2. Although the Dalai Lama was pro-British, he never forgot the Han people in his heart. He has recently passed away. The selection of his regent is very important. How to use political means to determine where the power lies, in order to achieve the effect of winning him over, is critical. 3. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama factions are like fire and water. Since the Central government honored the Panchen Lama, it was frequently reported that he would lead troops to Qinghai and enter Tibet. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, it is said that there is still no welcoming atmosphere for the Panchen Lama in Tibet. If the Panchen Lama is to return to Tibet, the Dalai Lama's faction should be reconciled first. Otherwise, he should be allowed to stay in the interior to preach, or invited to Mongolia to spread civilization. A clear announcement should be made according to the intention of the central government, so that the Tibetans can dispel their suspicions, which would also help to harmonize Kangding and Tibet. 4. Operating the Chuanbian region requires funds and supplies. Therefore, if the army is to be disciplined, it must be adequately supplied. If officials are to be honest, they must be adequately paid. The total revenue of Xikang is only enough to cover administrative expenses. Even if all military food supplies are diverted, it is still not enough. Therefore, the interior must provide financial assistance for military and administrative expenses, so that the responsibility of national defense can be shouldered to some extent. Jiang handed it over to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for handling. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

Divert the annual dike construction donations from the ten counties in the region; 2. Request the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to provide a portion of the funds (because dredging the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is closely related to the dredging project); 3. Request the National Economic Commission to allocate a portion; 4. Sell the silt islands and sand fields on both sides of the area. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Section on Embezzlement of Public Funds Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Jin Shuren Admits to Withdrawing Funds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jin Shuren case continued on the 17th. After reading the transcript from yesterday in court, the section on embezzlement of public funds was interrogated and completed today. Jin admitted to most of the charges, and the trial is scheduled to continue on the 19th.</p>
<p>(17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu High Court continued the trial of the Jin Shuren case at 1:00 PM on the 17th. The presiding judge remained the same, and lawyers Zhang Shaozeng, etc., and the accuser Ayssa, etc., were all present in court. First, the transcript of yesterday was read, and Jin made no amendments. Ayssa then supplemented, saying that he met with Mu Weitong in Tacheng in September of the 20th year of the Republic. At that time, the director of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Office had arrived and requested the provincial government to allow him to send a plane from Russia to take him to Dihua. Jin actually allowed it, showing that Jin was eager for the agreement to be reached quickly. Furthermore, the director of the Foreign Affairs Office asked Jin to hang a red flag to welcome him when he arrived in Dihua. Jin did not have time to make one, so he rolled up the blue sky and white sun part of the national flag, leaving only the red background part to replace the red flag. Then Jin was questioned about the embezzlement of public funds. First, Jin was asked about the provincial income and expenditure and the number of troops during his tenure, as well as the circumstances of his departure. Jin answered in detail one by one. Then he was questioned about the withdrawal of funds. Jin confessed: (1) He withdrew 120,000 yuan when he retreated to Changji, and more than 500,000 yuan when he retreated to Hutubi, totaling 700,000 yuan, all in Soviet currency. After the withdrawal, 500,000 yuan was used to buy military uniforms and severance pay for the more than 4,000 soldiers who followed him. The remaining 200,000 yuan was deposited with Lu Xiaozu, the administrative director of Tacheng. As for the more than 1,270 taels of gold bars, they were borrowed from Liu Wenlong, Ji Shan, etc., in Dihua using his personal credit. Originally, it was intended for the provincial government to purchase cars from the Soviet Union. Because the incident occurred, he was afraid that the government would not be able to repay the debt in the future, and he would have to be personally responsible, so he withdrew it again. Three hundred taels were used along the way, and there were still 900 taels left. This money cannot be regarded as public funds. He also said that the provincial government remitted 40,000 to 50,000 yuan to Tianjin Tongrenhe Dexing No. 2 every year for the use of the Beijing office, which had nothing to do with him personally. Then Ayssa was questioned, who said that he did not know whether the 700,000 taels were in cash or provincial notes, and he did not know how they were used. Jin's statement that the remaining 200,000 yuan was deposited with Director Lu was probably not accurate, because Liu Wenlong's report to Sheng Shicai did not mention it. As for the gold bars, since they were for the purchase of cars for the government, they were public funds. Moreover, the provincial government had telegraphed the Soviet Union to detain them. Later, when the Soviet cars arrived in Dihua, the provincial government had no money to pay, so it demanded it from the people, which made the people very angry. The two Tianjin firms had a great relationship with Jin, because when Jin was chairman, he used the two firms to sell gold, antelope horns, and black lambskins on consignment. The interrogation ended at 5:45 PM, and the trial is scheduled to continue at 1:00 PM on the 19th to question the charges of murder and arson. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Criticism of Britain on the Issue of Rescuing Silver Prices <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the silver faction in the US Congress under the Roosevelt administration advocated a policy of raising silver prices, some public opinion in China, which uses silver as its monetary standard, has believed that the change in US policy must have an absolutely opposite impact on China's interests. There are two factions for and against the approval of the London Eight-Nation Silver Agreement, and there is even more discussion on the plan to rescue silver prices, as if the rise or fall of silver prices is the key to the entire problem. However, in our view, this kind of disagreement is not enough to be said to have a basic understanding of China's silver problem today.</p>
<p>Silver, as a commodity, is regarded by the United States and other similar countries as the same as ordinary goods on the market. However, our country regards it as the standard for the value of all the wealth of the people. How its price rises and falls abroad not only affects the exchange rate of silver dollars or prices in our country, but also causes different views among all sectors of society on the interests of silver price fluctuations. The Roosevelt administration in the United States suddenly raised silver prices artificially when they had fallen miserably for a long time. There is no need to say how much it can harm our society and disrupt our finances. From the perspective of stabilizing society and promoting commerce, today's public opinion in our country advocates stabilizing the world silver market as a prerequisite, or even achieving the stability of our country's currency exchange rate. This is also the highest principle at present. However, the center of the problem lies elsewhere. That is, first, whether China's current financial organization can execute the purpose of stabilizing the foreign exchange rate under a certain plan. Second, whether the central government's current financial situation is sufficient to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the exchange rate. If both are impossible, then when the United States manipulates the silver market, our country will only be at the mercy of others and be in an absolutely passive position. If, under such circumstances, we talk highly about how to rescue silver prices, and even that the impact of silver prices is enough to cause absolute gains and losses, how can we explore the origins?</p>
<p>Looking at the past, when silver prices first fell in 1929, everyone in the country was troubled by the excessive fall in silver. Now that silver prices are about to rise, everyone is afraid again. Between gains and losses, they have failed to see the power of the central authorities and have failed to recognize the current financial organization. Therefore, there is no standard to speak of in the midst of joy and fear. Originally, the change in silver prices had no absolute standard for determining how much benefit or harm it would bring to us. When silver rises from cheap to expensive, domestic industrial capital is indeed under considerable pressure, and those who rely on gold coin income for their livelihoods have also suffered considerable losses (assuming that silver is expensive in relation to gold). However, at the same time, foreign goods are cheaper, and the burden on consumers is reduced. If it can be used to develop national construction undertakings, it may be enough to offset the harm of expensive silver. The reduction of foreign debt principal and interest is just a side effect. On the contrary, when silver goes from expensive to cheap, although it feels difficult to build and foreign debt increases daily, industries can be developed from this. Benefits and harms cannot be absolutely separated. From this point of view, when silver prices are uncertain, what is valuable is that the government and the people can implement a certain policy. Otherwise, the high or low price of silver is enough to bring endless worries to the country. The failure to actively develop the people's industry when silver was cheap after 1929 is the same as not necessarily doing anything when silver is expensive in the future. So, what is this certain policy? It is the stability of the central government's finances and the strengthening of the financial organization. These two things are already done. Only by understanding this can we discuss the impact of silver prices.</p>

<p>Observations by American Political Circles</p>
<p>(Washington) Senior US government officials are now gradually believing that Japan and Russia may be able to safely pass through the end of 1934 without resorting to arms. In the past week or two, the view held in official circles was that the Japanese-Russian war would break out around the first half of 1934, or even in the spring of 1934. This view can be seen in general in the declaration of Congressman Lenane three weeks ago. Lenane stated in his declaration that he hoped that the Japanese-Russian war would not be launched in the spring. Political observers seem to agree with the view that the trend of war and peace between Japan and Russia is shifted by the policies of the two countries in Manchuria. It is recognized here that the recent release of six Russian officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the "Manchukuo" government is a sign that the situation between Japan and Russia is gradually tending towards relaxation. Since the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov issued a declaration on December 29, 1933, condemning Japan for preparing for war against Russia, there have been many improvements in the situation between Japan and Russia. It is stated here that the purpose of the large amount of machinery and equipment currently purchased by Soviet Russian representatives in the United States is to revitalize Soviet Russian industry and commerce. However, this kind of industry is related to war preparations. Soviet Russian purchasing agents in the United States are very close to aircraft manufacturing factories, and it is said that they will specialize in ordering aircraft engines. Moreover, the purchase of machinery is also an important item in the Soviet Russian purchase list. This kind of machinery will include machines used to manufacture automobiles, nitrogen, and mining machines. (16th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Italy Does Not Want Central Europe to be Dominated by Any Country</p>
<p>Rome The agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary was signed at 4:00 PM today by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös. The agreement consists of two items, one for political events and one for economic events. It is reported that the agreement declares Austria's independence and the intention of the signatory countries to cooperate in order to promote the economic progress of the Danube countries, and invites other countries such as France, Germany, and the Little Entente to join this agreement. Prime Minister Mussolini has always held a firm position, not wanting Central Europe to be dominated by any country. Although the agreement signed today may involve economic concessions from Italy, this can be seen as a victory for Prime Minister Mussolini's advocacy of moderating Central Europe. (17th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome The trilateral meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, lasted for three hours, starting at 2:00 PM. It is rumored that the three countries will sign two conventions on political and economic matters tomorrow. It is said that the signing of this convention is the result of the first step of Prime Minister Mussolini's new policy. Mussolini's new policy is to avoid meetings attended by countries around the world, and instead consult with one or two neighboring countries separately to reach an agreement, because the convening of world conferences is both difficult and fruitless.</p>
<p>(17th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, met again today, ending the political and economic issues discussed yesterday, and initialed two protocols, which will be formally signed tomorrow. The negotiations started by the three prime ministers this week have come to an end. The authorities of the three countries are very satisfied with the results, but as of now, there has been no official statement on the content. Some say that an economic agreement will be signed at the end of the trilateral meeting tomorrow. This agreement, following the Italian principle, is signed separately with Austria and Hungary, not a joint agreement between the three parties. This bilateral treaty will provide special convenience for the commerce of Austria and Hungary, so that they can enjoy the two ports of "Trieste" (belonged to Austria before the war, and was assigned to Italy by the peace treaty) and "Fiume". In addition to the economic agreement, a political declaration will also be issued soon, clearly expressing the guarantee of Austria and Hungary's independence. (16th Hans Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome The two protocols initialed by the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian prime ministers today will be formally signed at 4:00 PM tomorrow. The nature of the two protocols is one economic and one political. The latter, in this conversation, has surpassed the economic nature and occupies the primary position. This political protocol does not link the three countries into a close group, but agrees to confirm the commonality of the interests of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and the necessity of continued cooperation. Under this meaning, this protocol contains the same meaning as the Four-Power Pact, and on the other hand, all countries related to the balance of power in Central Europe are also invited to participate, and to work together with the three contracting countries. Furthermore, this protocol does not stipulate that the territorial clauses in the peace treaty can be modified in the future. Hungarian public opinion is already satisfied with this protocol, and German public opinion is also comforted by it. (17th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome The talks between the prime ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary have resulted in a Danube agreement covering political and economic spheres. According to this agreement, Italy will give preferential treatment to Austrian grains and certain industrial products and timber from Austria, while Austria and Hungary will give preferential treatment to Italian exports, most of which are manufactured goods. Both Austria and Hungary will enjoy convenient access to the sea at "Trieste" and "Fiume". It is heard from some sources that the three countries have agreed to coordinate actions with each other on certain prescribed political issues, but the statement that the three countries will conclude a commercial agreement has not been confirmed. The Italian side is extremely willing for the three Little Entente countries of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania and Germany to understand the open nature of this agreement, because Italy and other countries all have the sincerity to seek the cooperation of the Little Entente countries and Germany. What Italy is most concerned about is the independence of the Danube countries, and any action of a hegemonic nature is unacceptable to Italy. (17th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss left his residence at 7:00 this morning and flew to the port of Naples. He will still return to Rome in the afternoon to participate in the trilateral meeting and formally sign the two protocols, political and economic. It is heard that the economic protocol is not a detailed agreement, so some experts from Austria and Hungary are still staying in Rome and are not returning to their countries with Dollfuss and Gömbös. In short, Austrian expert Hiller, the president of the central bank, will return here before Easter to detail the economic agreement that has already been started. (17th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Moscow) *Izvestia* commented on the trips of Dollfuss and Gömbös to Rome, saying that the focus of the Rome negotiations was not on economics but on other aspects. Although the Italian press denied this, it could not conceal the truth. Previously, Habicht, the leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party, had issued an ultimatum to the Austrian government, but it had come to naught. This was none other than due to the resolute attitude adopted by the Italian government. If necessary, Italy would not hesitate to defend Austria's independence by force. Paris and Rome were trying to rely on the Rome negotiations to ease the divergence between the Little Entente and Italian policies. However, in our opinion, such negotiations will not have much effect. At most, these negotiations can serve as a way for each to explain their position, but they are by no means steps that can determine the fate of the Danube and Balkan countries. These issues cannot be resolved through diplomacy. (TASS dispatch on the 16th)</p>

The dove of peace has once again come to the "French political battlefield," because Doumergue, formerly known as "Happy President" and now known as "Happy Premier," has completed his thirty-seven days in office under the slogan of "political truce and appeal to public opinion." The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will grant Premier Doumergue broad powers during the recess, which is a first for the French Parliament. This power includes increasing or decreasing tariffs and drastically tightening the national budget. Doumergue's previous cabinet had been dissolved multiple times due to disputes with Parliament over this power. Before the Chamber of Deputies reconvenes, it intends to hand over these matters entirely to Doumergue. (National Telegram on the 17th)</p>

The Senate still faithfully adheres to this motion. It also states that the Senate has repeatedly issued declarations in the past, stating that when Germany re-arms and there is no organized security internationally, if there is any international convention that is sufficient to force France to reduce its armaments or abandon the conditions that are indispensable for its national security, France should not be bound by it. The Senate has always faithfully adhered to this declaration and will never change it," and so on. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

Select areas with good law and order and the ability to crack down on planting, gather the planting area determined by the group, and strive to obtain a sufficient harvest. Clearly define the permitted and prohibited areas in the designated counties, and jointly and strictly crack down on them by the Law and Order Maintenance Association and other relevant agencies.

<p>(Washington) Today, a subcommittee of the House of Representatives proposed authorizing the President to negotiate changes in tariff rates with the governments of various countries. The bill was passed immediately after it was introduced, and its speed was unexpected. Republican leaders and members of that party are now assisting this bill. If the Republican members of the House and Senate who oppose this proposal do not account for a majority, it is believed that the President will be granted unlimited power to promote the implementation of various tariff bills. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce collected the opinions of the majority of the business community and expressed opposition to this proposal because the power of the ruling party will be too unlimited, but they still express agreement in principle.</p>

<p>Government Tries Hard to Salvage</p>
<p>The Market Has Been Affected</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government is said to be making good progress in averting serious strikes in the nation's key industries, and the government will strive to avert a general strike in another industry. Many railroad directors, in a petition submitted to President Roosevelt today, expressed their agreement with the President's demand to stop "wage reductions for railway employees" in the past six months. According to various railway companies, in addition to the 10% "wage reduction" currently being implemented, a 5% "wage reduction" will be negotiated this month, and this new rule will be implemented from July 1. However, it is widely believed that this matter will not take effect, because at a time when various industrialists are increasing wages for workers or attempting to increase wages, the government will not allow any industrial organization to make unilateral reductions. The strike by automobile industry employees, originally scheduled to be held today, has now been postponed until after the meeting between the National Automobile Manufacturers Association and National Recovery Administrator Johnson. The meeting between Johnson and the National Automobile Manufacturers Association will be held on Tuesday. According to labor leaders, if the meeting does not reach a satisfactory agreement, a strike will be called on Wednesday. It is said that the focus of the conflict is that automobile industry employers do not recognize workers' organizations and unions, while workers demand working hours, wages, and other issues. The company intends to negotiate directly with the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The company authorities not only refused this consultation, but further organized company groups to resist. Recently, the National Automobile Manufacturers Association suggested increasing wages and reducing working hours, but this suggestion was not accepted by other companies except for Ford Motor Company. It is said that the automobile industry is currently in the peak season, because the orders received in March exceed the company's manufacturing volume. The impact of the strike on the stock market in the past two weeks is like a "dark cloud in the clear sky." The chairman of the American Federation of Labor issued a similar threatening statement, saying that if the automobile industry companies cannot accept the workers' demands, an unprecedented large-scale strike is feared to be imminent.

At that time, suspects Sianka and his son and two others were arrested. The trial was opened by a military court today. Armed troops and Blackshirt personnel were on strict alert around the court. The defendants Sianka and the other three initially strongly denied attempting to assassinate the Prime Minister, saying that the bombing was only a demonstration by anti-fascist groups and was not intended to harm him.

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>A telegram from Guangzhou. All newspapers and the public are hereby notified that the Japanese invasion of the Northeast has lasted for three years. The puppet regime has been in power for two years. Sovereignty has been lost, and refugees are displaced. Examining historical records, there is no such shame. The Northeast is our country's territory, with clear historical evidence and obvious geographical facts. Despite the rebel Puyi's insanity and perverse actions, attempting to lose temporarily and disregarding the consequences, he has gone from being an executive to usurping the title of emperor, acting as a puppet and falsely claiming the will of heaven, inviting ridicule from all nations. Extreme indignation! It is hoped that all compatriots nationwide will rise up together, urge the government to make a firm decision, launch punitive expeditions to uphold national law, and recover lost territory to secure sovereignty. The future of the nation truly depends on this. Special Party Department Executive Committee of the First Army Group Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army.</p>

<p>[Missing Beginning of Headline] Tibetan Army Commits Offense, Situation in Xikang Serious</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Telegraphs that Tibetan Army Illegally Crosses Tongtian River</p>
<p>Delegates from Xikang Meeting at Aida Present Four Demands</p>
<p>Delegates from Xikang Refute Reasonably and Are Almost Detained</p>
<p>Xikang News: The situation in Xikang and Tibet has suddenly become serious. According to recent news from the front, the Tibetan army, using the monks and soldiers of the Da Jin Temple as their vanguard, circumvented and illegally crossed the Jinsha River on Lunar New Year's Eve (February 13th). They confronted our defending troops for two days. Seeing that our forces were weak and difficult to support, they increased the majority of their forces at dawn on February 15th and fiercely attacked Dengke County City on the east bank of the Jinsha River, cutting off the traffic between Dengke and Dege. Only one company of troops was stationed in Dengke City. Due to the disparity in numbers, they immediately withdrew. The Tibetan army then occupied the city. Deng Rang, brigade commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Sichuan-Xikang Army, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Regiment Commander Zhang Werong to reinforce. On the 16th, the two sides officially made contact at a strategic pass between Dengke and Dege. The Tibetan soldiers were unable to resist and retreated towards Dengke. Our army arrived near Dengke City on the same day. On the 17th, Dengke was recaptured. The two sides engaged in a fierce melee and charge. As a result, our army gradually regained its original positions. The Tibetan army and the monks and soldiers of the Da Jin Temple retreated in disarray to concentrate at Guanyin Temple. This was at noon on the 17th. The terrain of Guanyin Temple is strategic. The Tibetan army relies on bunkers in that place to defend stubbornly. Our army initially selected a daredevil team to charge, throwing grenades, but the bunkers were solid, easy to defend and difficult to attack. After a stalemate of several days, only over a hundred enemy soldiers were injured, and Guanyin Temple could not be officially recaptured. Later, Zhang Guo dispatched a company each of mortars and mountain guns, rushing to assist in the attack. It is expected that it will be captured within days. Because Guanyin Temple is isolated on the west bank of the Jinsha River, Dengke cannot be captured in a day if Guanyin Temple cannot be captured in a day. At the same time, in the Dege area, the two sides also officially made contact from the 17th. The Tibetan army used machine guns and cannons to cover a large number of leather boats, attempting to force a crossing of the river. Fortunately, our side had built solid fortifications on the east bank, and the Tibetan army calmly resisted when it attacked, sinking many leather boats. The Tibetan side ultimately did not succeed. However, the Tibetan army's offense against Xikang has been prepared for a long time. Now that it has officially launched, their numbers are large and ours are small. Although our side has achieved a temporary victory, the future is still uncertain. Later, Tang Ying and Deng Rang jointly telegraphed Liu Wenhui, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense, requesting reinforcements as soon as possible. After receiving the telegram, Liu reported to all parties on the 23rd and issued a circular telegram on the 25th. In addition to detailing the battle situation at the front, he briefly stated that the enemy army had brazenly started the war, and the war had spread horizontally. It was Wenhui's responsibility to fight hard to defend the border. However, the actual food and funds were already extremely difficult in peacetime. During this military period, it was by no means something that a poor area could handle. He hoped that a comprehensive allocation would be given quickly to avoid mistakes. It is heard that Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, has sent a telegram to Ya'an, still urging Liu to do his best to avoid military action and advocating a peaceful resolution. However, the Tibetan army has made up its mind to commit offenses against Xikang and has been instigated by a certain imperialist. Now that the two sides have met in battle, if one wants to turn hostility into friendship, one must, of course, satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>As for the purpose of the Tibetan side, it can be seen in the recent Aida meeting. Earlier, Galun Zhendong, stationed in Changdu, Tibet, previously sent his collaborator Xie Jiao, accompanied by translator Cai Jiarong, to Xikang. He then went to Ya'an to visit Liu Wenhui, stating that the Tibetan side had recently lost the Dalai Lama, and Silon Gasha continued to preside over the political and religious power. They have now decided to support the central government and jointly defend against the pressure of foreign forces. The disputes between Tibet and Xikang in recent years have also had a considerable impact on the relationship between the Han and Tibetans. Now, they have decided to make concessions to Xikang and have sent Qiong Rang, a representative familiar with the situation in Xikang and Tibet, to Aida to negotiate with the representatives of the Sichuan-Xikang army. At the same time, the three major temples of Lhasa have also sent representatives to participate in the matter, requesting Liu to send another representative. At that time, Liu was just because the Tibetan side was preparing to invade urgently, and he sent Jiang Yuwen, the negotiator of Kangzang and magistrate of Dege, to depart from Dege, cross the river to Aida, pay condolences to the Dalai Lama, and spy on the reality of the Tibetan army. After Jiang arrived in Aida, Qiong Rang's representative and the representatives of the three major temples also went one after another. Jiang and Qiong Rang were both drafters of the Kangzang peace and war agreement in the past. Unexpectedly, this time they met, Qiong Rang put on a stern face and completely overturned the Kangzang peace treaty. The two sides formally met on February 8th. Qiong Rang then put forward the following four conditions, which were even more demanding than the previous repeated requests from the Tibetan side. The conditions are as follows: (1) Dege (including Dengke, Shiqu Baiyu counties, etc.), Ganzi, Zhanhua, Zhuwo (a village belonging to Luhuo County), and Yan Well in southern Kang, and Hexi villages belonging to Ba'an County must be completely handed over to the jurisdiction of the Tibetan side. (2) The ceasefire agreement signed by both sides in Kangzang in Gangtuo last year should be invalid, and the Sichuan-Xikang army should not be allowed to invoke it again. (3) The monks of the Da Jin Temple have been wandering without a home since they retreated across the Jinsha River to the west bank last year. The Sichuan-Xikang army should now unconditionally allow them to return to the temple and must not deliberately obstruct them. (4) If the Sichuan-Xikang army does not allow the monks of the Da Jin Temple to return to the temple, they will take free action, and the Tibetan side cannot be held responsible. Jiang reasonably refuted, briefly stating that Dege Ganza and Hexi areas of Ba'an are areas belonging to Xikang, and the Sichuan-Xikang military authorities have no right to freely cede them. If the central government explicitly orders them to be ceded to the Tibetan side, they will, of course, comply. If they have not obtained the consent of the central government, the Sichuan-Xikang army cannot give up an inch of Xikang land. If the Tibetan side has this request, they can directly submit it to the central government. The Gangtuo agreement was negotiated by the representatives of both sides in Kangzang and has been approved by the central government. It should now be jointly observed. If a new agreement is to be signed, it should also be based on this standard. How can it be overturned in one day? The monks of the Da Jin Temple have caused chaos for years, and the continuous wars between Kangzang and the joint result of both sides, the temple is also difficult to escape its blame. Last year, the Sichuan-Xikang army drove them out of the country. It was also because the crime deserved it. The Sichuan-Xikang army did not investigate the past and allowed them to return to the temple, which was already a sign of generosity. As for limiting them from bringing firearms into the country, it was also the authorities' punishment for the past and a precautionary measure. If the Tibetan army secretly helps them to cause chaos, the Tibetan army should bear the responsibility. The two sides debated for a long time on the 8th, 9th, 10th and 13th without any concrete results. The Tibetan side even planned to detain Jiang. Later, with the mediation of the representatives of the three major temples, it was decided that the representatives of both sides should ask their respective superiors for instructions. Jiang had just returned to Dege when the Kangzang war suddenly broke out. It is feared that it will not be easy to resolve in a short time. (China United Press)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Premier Sun's Thought and Personality <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>—Chiang's Speech at the Memorial Service for Premier Sun's Death Anniversary—</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters convened representatives from various sectors at 10:00 AM on the 12th in the flower garden at the entrance of the main hall to hold a memorial meeting for the ninth anniversary of Premier Sun's passing. Attendees included Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Xueliang, Ding Chao, Wu Shixui, Yang Yongtai, He Guoguang, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, and representatives from various sectors, totaling approximately 600 people. The entire group stood in a circle, led by Chiang Kai-shek in performing the memorial ceremony. Immediately following, he delivered a speech, elaborating on Premier Sun's fundamental thoughts and revolutionary personality throughout his life. The entire audience stood attentively, and the atmosphere was solemn. The meeting concluded around noon with music and a group photograph. The recorded transcript of Chiang's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, today is the memorial day for our Premier's passing. Nine years ago today, at this very moment, our Premier passed away in Beiping. As we commemorate the Premier's death today, we should remember his final call: 'Peace, Struggle, Save China.' This is what the Premier told us: We must overthrow imperialism and complete the National Revolution to save China. We must use peaceful methods, unite in spirit, and make concerted efforts to sacrifice for the country, fighting to the end. Today, as we recall the Premier's last words, 'Peace, Struggle, Save China,' we can understand the revolutionary environment at that time and the Premier's difficult and arduous struggle. From this, we can recognize the Premier's great revolutionary personality. Furthermore, in the weeks before the Premier's passing, Mr. Dai Jitao once asked the Premier about the philosophical foundation of his revolutionary doctrine. Mr. Dai also reported his own research findings on this issue to the Premier. After he finished speaking, the Premier said, 'Your understanding is correct. My revolutionary philosophy is the Philosophy of People's Livelihood.' It was on this occasion that the Premier systematically and concisely imparted his revolutionary philosophy to us. Subsequently, Mr. Dai, based on the Premier's meaning and his own research, wrote a book titled 'The Philosophical Foundation of Sun Wenism,' and specially included a 'Systematic Chart of the Philosophy of People's Livelihood' with an additional explanation as the conclusion of the entire book. Today, as we commemorate the Premier here, each and every one of us should firmly believe in the Premier's revolutionary doctrine, deeply understand the Premier's great revolutionary personality, and genuinely become a follower of the Premier. To do so, we must first clearly understand the origin of the Premier's revolutionary thought, the entire revolutionary personality of the Premier, and the foundation upon which his career was built. Therefore, today I will explain the principles of the Philosophy of People's Livelihood based on the explanations in the Systematic Chart of the Philosophy of People's Livelihood, and share them with all the comrades in Nanchang.</p>
<p>The original explanation states, 'Those who study Sun Yat-senism should first know nine things. First, "The fundamental thought of Mr. Sun is entirely rooted in the Doctrine of the Mean, the orthodox thought of China. Mr. Sun is truly the great sage who inherits the past and opens up the future in the moral culture of China after Confucius."' This first point is about recognizing the source of Premier Sun's thought and his highest position in the history of Chinese culture and morality, pointing out that the Premier is the modern great sage who inherited the orthodox thought of China.</p>
<p>Second, "Mr. Sun's knowledge includes the latest modern science, and he always uses modern scientific methods to solve all problems." This second point is about Premier Sun's thought and learning. In terms of the source of his thought, it naturally inherited the orthodox thought of China throughout history, namely the Doctrine of the Mean since Confucius and Mencius. However, in terms of the scope of his learning, especially the method of solving all practical problems, it actually includes the latest modern science. This is why he became the greatest sage of modern times. We know that if a person only knows the Doctrine of the Mean of the ancients and does not understand the latest science, and cannot use scientific methods to solve all practical problems, then that is a bookworm. Premier Sun's fundamental thought and learning truly spanned the past and the present, encompassing both China and the West, thereby crystallizing into his revolutionary doctrine and manifesting into his revolutionary cause.</p>
<p>Third, "The principles of Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People are all included within the Principle of People's Livelihood. All his works can be collectively named the Philosophy of People's Livelihood." This third point is to point out that the Three Principles of the People take the Principle of People's Livelihood as the center, and all of Premier Sun's writings can be summarized as the Philosophy of People's Livelihood. The Premier once said, "People's livelihood is the center of history." This sentence is the Premier's final conclusion in his study of history, and it is also a basic theorem of the Philosophy of People's Livelihood. Revolutionary doctrine is originally the highest principle of using human power to conform to and control history. Since people's livelihood is the center of history, the Philosophy of People's Livelihood is the foundation of revolutionary thought. If we want to understand the fundamental system of Premier Sun's thought, we must pay special attention to the study of the Philosophy of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>Fourth, "Mr. Sun's lifelong efforts were all to save the country and the people through revolutionary means, to break all dreams of individualism, and to realize the Three Principles of the People." This means that Premier Sun's lifelong efforts were to save the country and the nation through revolutionary means. Where does the Premier's revolutionary means lie? It is to break all illusions of individualism, that is, all selfish and self-interested attempts. Because selfish and self-interested individualism is harmful to the entire country and nation, if we want to save the country and the nation, we must thoroughly eradicate this kind of thought and action, and then we can realize Premier Sun's Three Principles of the People to save the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Fifth, "The original purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to restore the nation's self-confidence. Because if the nation's self-confidence cannot be restored, then this weak and large ancient cultural nation, its aging and illness cannot be saved. All new activities cannot be generated. Even if they occur, they do not escape the state of illness and cannot save the nation from peril." This passage is about the fundamental purpose of the Three Principles of the People, which is to awaken the masses and restore the confidence of the general public in their own nation, to understand that our Chinese nation not only possesses the national spirit of self-reliance and independence, but also possesses the superior intelligence of creativity and invention, and even more so, the inherent virtue of peace, righteousness, and supreme greatness. We have a glorious history of five thousand years and a beautiful culture. We are truly an ancient civilized country and an excellent nation. No matter when, no matter how critical the situation, as long as we can restore our inherent national spirit and intelligence, we can certainly promote the glorious history of our nation, build our truly independent and free new country, and open up a long-lasting new life for our entire national civilization. In any case, we cannot be subjected to the oppression and aggression of imperialism, especially not to abandon ourselves and forget the great spirit and glorious history left to us by our ancestors. We must always remember how great our ancestors were and how strong our country has always been. Can't we do now what our ancestors could do before? Each of us must have this confidence and understand that our Chinese nation is not to be bullied at will. Now that people are bullying us, we don't need to be afraid. We must restore the inherent spirit, virtue, and intelligence of the nation to overthrow imperialism and build a brilliant Republic of China.</p>
<p>Sixth, "The method of implementing the Three Principles of the People lies in the common effort of the entire nation to complete the National Revolution, to concentrate the effort of the Chinese National Revolution, and to use state capitalism as the foundation for building the Republic of China." This article discusses the method of implementing the Three Principles of the People. The first step is to awaken the masses so that the entire nation can unite and work together for the revolution. The second step is to complete the National Revolution, which here refers to unifying the country with revolutionary force. The third step is to concentrate the power of the people and the revolutionary party across the country, aiming at state capitalism and working hard to build it, in order to lay the foundation for the country's eternal stability.</p>
<p>Seventh, "The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People is to treat the social diseases caused by capitalism throughout the world, to build a new communist society with the common efforts of all mankind, and to complete a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed world of Great Harmony, that is, to create a world where there is no poverty, no scarcity, and no insecurity." One article is about the method of gradually implementing the Three Principles of the People by China, and one article is about the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, which is to negatively treat the social diseases caused by capitalism throughout the world, and to positively create a "people-owned, people-governed, people-enjoyed" ideal world of Great Harmony. The problems that have arisen in capitalist society are numerous. The biggest point is the disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor have no food to eat, and the rich are extremely rich. The Three Principles of the People is the right medicine to cure all the social diseases of capitalism and achieve the goal of people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed. This kind of great reform, which takes the world as its scope, requires the common efforts of all mankind. With the common efforts of all mankind, a communist society throughout the world, that is, the so-called world of Great Harmony, can be built. Therefore, the Three Principles of the People is true communism that enables everyone to have clothes to wear and food to eat, not the fake communism that generally loots houses, kills, and sets fires.

<p>Wu Xiangsheng, a farmer from Jiufang Bridge in the eighth district of the county, has three daughters, but he has been addicted to smoking and gambling since childhood and does not engage in proper work. Although his father repeatedly taught him, he still did not listen, so he was ordered to live separately. In less than a few years, he squandered all his family property. A few days ago, he failed to borrow money from relatives and returned home empty-handed. In the evening, taking advantage of people's unpreparedness, he hanged himself. When his wife noticed, he was already dead.</p>

<p>A Demonic Person Misleads the Public and is Detained and Sent to the County Bureau</p>
<p>Three miles northeast of Lou Tang Town in the fifth district, there is a Cao'an Temple with an image of Emperor Yue inside. Dong Feiyan, from the former Lu Du Bridge Township, lived there to recuperate and slept in the same room with Zhong Asheng, the temple keeper, who was a tailor by trade. During the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar, Zhong pretended to be in front of the statue of Emperor Yue, treading on the soil to form a pool. Immortal water was found in the pool. At the same time, he claimed that Emperor Yue had possessed him, talking nonsense, saying that the immortal water in the pool could cure all diseases. Those who asked for medical treatment had to have him stroke the affected area. The news spread, and foolish men and women were misled by it. Hundreds of people came from afar every day, and each person was charged 200 copper coins, which was managed by the temple director Zhu Guifang. Within ten days, the income reached hundreds of yuan. Pan Jixiang, the director of the Lou Tang Public Security Branch, in charge, believing that the person was a demon misleading the public, ordered the police to detain Zhong on the 12th. During the interrogation, Zhong still claimed to be Duke Yue. Pan sentenced him to 15 days of detention. Wu Nianqu and Zhang Zhenfei, who were of the same mind as Zhong, gathered a crowd of three to four hundred people by beating gongs and resisted. The group went to the Public Security Bureau and claimed that unless Zhong was released, they would take action. Director Pan, feeling that the police force was weak and to avoid causing trouble, did not refuse firmly. Jiang Linxiang, the brother-in-law of Fei Yan, provided bail for his release. After Zhong was released, the crowd placed Zhong in a sedan chair and carried him back to the temple on their shoulders, setting off firecrackers along the way, feeling very pleased. After returning to the temple, he continued to mislead the public and collect money as before. Director Pan telegraphed the situation to the County Public Security Bureau. Mei Buchun, the district chief of the fifth district in charge, also telegraphed the county government to stop it. On the 14th, Xue Bingyang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, sent four detectives to pretend to seek medical treatment and tried to lure Zhong to Lou Tang, then detained him and sent him to the bureau. It has been three days since then, and there has been no news of sending him to the county. All parties believe that this trend cannot be allowed to grow, and they are paying close attention to the handling of the Public Security Bureau. On the 15th, there were still more than 700 Buddhist women in the temple gathering to hold a Amitabha meeting, and there were still many people seeking immortal water.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the County Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county held its first joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees yesterday after the second re-election. Cai Jiansan presided over the meeting. (1) It was resolved that the monthly report and final accounts of the Chamber of Commerce should still be submitted to the meeting for reporting as before, and should be reviewed by the Supervisory Committee. In addition, it was decided that 2:00 PM on the 18th of each month would be the date for the regular meeting of the Supervisory Committee to emphasize accounting. (2) The reorganization of this session coincided with the decline of the business market. It should be earnestly presented to the local government offices and all tax collection agencies to understand the difficulties of the merchants and to maintain their business in the event of any incident, so as to stabilize business. As for the guilds of various industries, which are originally organizations of the same industry, as long as the same industry is at peace with each other, the organization is sound. It should also be requested that the Party and government agencies take into account that the merchant group is not comparable to a political organization. In the future, if there are any deficiencies in the procedures for the reporting of organizations by the guilds of various industries, or if the procedures are occasionally not in compliance, it seems appropriate to understand the original situation and avoid multiple criticisms, so as to maintain business and promote it. (3) The fence of the open space along the street of the Chamber of Commerce's East Gate collapsed. It is planned to plan and rebuild the city houses. It was decided that the Standing Committee would be in charge of contacting and handling the matter.</p>

<p>Liu Zhuomin, the deputy director of the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security, was dismissed by the provincial authorities for his poor handling of affairs, and Gao Chongshan, the deputy director of the First Branch Bureau, was appointed to fill the position. However, Liu Zhuomin refused to hand over the position. Liu's wife, Li Rongzhen, caused a great disturbance at the bureau, which turned into a theatrical drama in the officialdom. After the County Magistrate Yan ordered the Public Security Bureau to send armed police to take over, the matter was finally brought to an end. Yesterday (17th) afternoon at 2:00 PM, County Magistrate Yan ordered Deputy Director Gao to take over and ordered Xu Yi, the director of the guard stock, to go to the bureau to supervise the handover. Liu Zhuomin, knowing that he was at fault, handed over the seal and documents one by one. County Magistrate Yan, believing that Liu Zhuomin had left his post without authorization, refused to hand over the position, and embezzled more than 200 yuan of public funds, which violated the law and discipline, ordered Deputy Director Gao to place Liu under custody and transfer him to the General Bureau for transfer to the County Government for interrogation that evening.</p>

<p>Wang Jinxiu, a 17-year-old woman from Changzhou, lost her parents in her early years. Last spring, she was deceived by her clan uncle and brother to Suzhou, where she was sold to Gu Chen's Yaofeng Brothel at No. 6 Dexian Lane, outside of Changmen, to be a prostitute. Jinxiu was unwilling and tried to escape many times. When there were no customers, she was often beaten by the madam. Over the past year, she had been covered with wounds and her body was incomplete. The night before last (16th), she met a customer who was a police officer at a certain hotel. Unexpectedly, when it was time to sleep, two police officers slept together. Jinxiu was afraid and refused, shouting for help. Gu Chen was helpless and had to return the night fare, taking Jinxiu back and giving her a severe beating. The next day (17th), Jinxiu took the opportunity to deceive a gold ring from the ear of Gu Chen's niece, Yuanyuan, and escaped to the station to sell it, hoping to get money to buy a ticket to return home. The road police saw that she looked distraught and questioned her, knowing the truth, so they escorted her to the women's reformatory. Unexpectedly, Jinxiu was too badly injured. After arriving at the station, she vomited and diarrhea non-stop, and fell into a coma in bed. After being transferred to the county hospital, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and peritonitis, and there were serious injuries to her chest, back, lower abdomen. Her gallbladder and stomach were also severely injured, so she was hospitalized for treatment. At the same time, the madam Gu Chen was detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau. When Jinxiu first arrived at the hospital, she had recounted the suffering of the brothel and asked to rescue her three prostitutes in the same hospital.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation recently received a letter from the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, which reads, "Regarding the anti-Chinese party named 'Pro-Race Patriotic Association' in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, whose primary goal is to expel Overseas Chinese. They have recently been distributing leaflets and making announcements everywhere, exclusively boycotting Chinese people, demanding the expulsion of our people. On the evenings of January 25th and 26th, speeches were made in theaters, all with insulting and malicious words. For several days, they paraded, shouting the slogan of expelling Overseas Chinese, and using cloths to write words such as 'Expel the Chinese' and 'Strictly Enforce Boycott.' In this situation, our people dare not look up. On March 4th, the same thing happened again, with a surging momentum, treating Overseas Chinese as enemies. On the morning of the 5th, several leaders directed party members, with a party badge sewn on their left sleeves, to guard each Chinese-owned store with two people, prohibiting Mexicans from entering the stores to buy anything. The local police have no authority to intervene. Complaints to local officials are ignored. Several letters and telegrams have been sent to our country's minister in Mexico, requesting serious negotiations with the Mexican government to stop the boycott and the dangerous actions of the rioters. It has been several days, and we have not seen instructions from Minister Huang. All Overseas Chinese are panicked and in imminent danger. We have no choice but to send this letter to your office to present the dangerous situation, hoping that you will consider the meaning of being of the same race, find a way to rescue us, and also request that it be published in newspapers, and forwarded to our country's embassy and consulate in Mexico, so that they can know the urgency of our situation and find a way to rescue us with all their strength, so that we can avoid being harmed by the anti-Chinese party. We would be very fortunate. Sincerely, the entire Overseas Chinese population of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, salutes you. February 6, 23rd year."</p>

<p>Chiang is satisfied with the draft constitution.</p>
<p>The bandits will be wiped out within a few months of military operations.</p>
<p>The Economic Commission will convene a general meeting within two weeks.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and returned to Nanjing on the 16th. That evening, he and Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Commission, took the night train to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 7:20 AM yesterday. Yesterday, Mr. Sun received a group of reporters at his residence on Columbia Road, discussing the meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi. His remarks are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chiang has no objection to the draft constitution.</p>
<p>Sun said first, "This time, I went to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to seek his opinion on the draft constitution and to discuss the affairs of the Economic Commission. The financial issues were discussed directly between Minister Kong and Chiang, so I am not familiar with the details. As for diplomatic issues, they fall within the scope of Director Wang, and we did not discuss them. Chairman Chiang is satisfied with the initial draft of the constitution. I am still studying it and have no specific opinions, but I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will refer to the national conditions and express their opinions as much as possible, paying attention to practicality, so that a perfect constitution can be compiled, which can lay the foundation for national affairs."</p>
<p>The Central Government hopes that Hu will travel to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Sun continued, "Mr. Hu Zhantang has a long history in the Party and is one of the Standing Committee Members of the Central Political Council. All comrades in the Central Government respect his opinions very much and hope that he can travel to Nanjing as soon as possible to take joint responsibility. Last year, the Central Government repeatedly sent personnel to the south to welcome Hu to the north, but it did not become a reality. Therefore, whether Mr. Hu is willing to go to Nanjing or not is his personal freedom, and others should not force him. The rumors that I sent a letter to Hu urging him are not true."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Great progress in bandit suppression military operations. <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>"Regarding the bandit suppression military operations in Jiangxi Province, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stationed himself to supervise the suppression, all the bandits have been defeated and dispersed, and many occupied areas have been recovered. It is heard that Chiang has strictly ordered all military commanders to pursue and suppress them as soon as possible in order to completely eliminate the banditry in the province. According to the current situation, it is hoped that the banditry in Jiangxi Province will be completely eliminated within three or four months. Furthermore, Chiang summoned all division and brigade commanders and provincial department heads to Jiangxi to listen to his instructions, all of which were about improving the military and political affairs under their jurisdiction. Chiang has recently been very determined to encircle and suppress the bandits in Jiangxi, and plans not to return to Nanjing temporarily before the bandit suppression military operations are concluded."</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Economic Commission will hold a general meeting. <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Sun also said, "The funding of the National Economic Commission is currently quite difficult. Minister Kong has discussed this with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The source of funds is from the US cotton and wheat loans. However, due to the abundant domestic production of US cotton and wheat, sales are slow, so we have no choice but to negotiate with the United States to reduce the amount of the loan, from US$50 million to US$20 million. It is expected that the US will eventually agree. However, US$20 million is only 60 million yuan in national currency. After deducting 20 million yuan for transportation and handling fees, the remaining amount is only 40 million yuan.

<h3 id="e128">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce again requests instructions on how to deal with fellow traders who do not join the association. <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received reports from various trade associations stating that fellow traders resisted joining the association, the spirit of the association was dissipated, and the associations jointly requested the government to formulate measures to sanction those who did not join the association in order to facilitate economic control. The original text has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is learned that the association received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, which did not approve the formulation of implementation measures, and therefore presented a rebuttal based on reason. The original texts of the approval and presentation are recorded separately below. Approval from the Ministry of Industry: The presentation has been received. Article 7 of the Trade Association Law states that companies and firms in the same trade should be members of the Trade Association. Therefore, those in the same trade in the same area should naturally join the association, fulfill the obligations of members, and abide by the articles of association. However, there are no provisions for sanctions in this law. Only the association itself can, in accordance with Article 1 and Article 4, Section 7 of the same law, stipulate punishments for violations of the articles of association in the articles of association. The law does not grant the Ministry the power to formulate implementation measures, and the Ministry is not in a position to formulate them without authorization. The information presented is hereby acknowledged. This approval. The Chamber of Commerce resubmits: (Omitted above) Regarding the so-called traders in the same area who do not join the association, the Ministry of Industry stated that only the association itself can, in accordance with Article 1 and Article 4, Section 7 of the Trade Association Law, stipulate punishments for violations of the articles of association. After further research, there are still many doubts. Although traders in the same area have the obligation to join the association as members in accordance with the law, the acquisition of membership qualifications is only possible after the trader himself applies to join the association. Now, let's compare the articles of association of the association to the school rules. The articles of association can only punish members, just as the school rules can only punish students. Traders in the same area should join the association in accordance with the law, which is the same as the situation in countries that implement a compulsory education system, where children of school age should be ordered to attend school in accordance with the law. If there are those who resist not joining at this time, only the administrative authorities can punish them, and it does not seem possible to entrust the school to punish students who have not entered the school in accordance with the school rules. Moreover, the above situation is still theoretical, and according to the facts, it is even more absolutely unfeasible. The most effective method for commercial organizations to punish members who violate the rules is to suspend the rights that members should enjoy, and in the most serious cases, to expel them. The rest are not within the power of the association. If those who resist not joining the association are punished by the above methods, they have not joined the association in the first place, and originally did not expect to enjoy the rights of members, and expulsion would also have nothing to expel. To speak of punishment in this regard is actually the same as no punishment. If the association forwards this order, the various associations will still have no way to act, and they will inevitably come to question it. It is appropriate to submit another request to the Ministry for clear instructions on the method, so that there is something to follow. It is in the public interest.</p>

<h3 id="e132">North China Hurricane: Three Steamships Encounter Danger <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The North China Sea has been hit by hurricanes for days. Within the past three days, merchant ships encountering danger and sustaining damage include the Hexing, Lianxing, and Pingji. They have suffered from damaged machinery, severe peril, or destroyed cargo. Our reporter has investigated in detail and recorded the situations as follows:</p>
<p>Hexing: The Hexing ship of the Zhaoxing Company had just been repaired in the Lushun shipyard, with more than 300 iron plates replaced throughout the ship. After completion, it sailed to Shanghai, and then on the 13th, it loaded miscellaneous grains and foreign cloth to Yantai, Longkou, and Dalian Bay from Shanghai. It sailed from Wusong in the morning, and on the 15th, it reached the Black Water Ocean. The ship was immediately hit by a hurricane. The ship fought desperately against the storm in the raging waves. Having entered the hurricane circle, it was impossible to stop. It could only sail with all its strength. The ship was repeatedly in danger. The deck and cabin surface were often rolled in by waves. The cargo holds were filled with seawater, and much of the cargo was soaked and damaged. After ten hours of crisis, it managed to escape the hurricane circle. The ship is now approaching Longkou, but the cargo in each hold has been severely damaged. The amount of loss will only be verified after unloading at the port.</p>
<p>Lianxing: The Lianxing ship of the Zhaoxing Company was loaded with more than 1,200 tons of soybean oil, peanuts, cement, etc. It sailed from Tianjin via Yantai and Weihaiwei to Shanghai. It encountered a hurricane as soon as it sailed out of Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>For the sake of navigation safety, the ship urgently sailed to the Rongcheng Bay Strait and anchored for two days to avoid the strong wind. On the morning of the 15th, it received a weather report from the observatory stating that the storm had passed. The Lianxing then set sail from Rongcheng directly to Shanghai. At 8 a.m., the ship arrived north of Sheshan, at 1.37 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude. Suddenly, the hurricane struck again, with the wind coming from the west-northwest. At this time, the Lianxing had no way to avoid it and could not turn the ship around. The magnitude of the wind and waves was alarming. A wave hit, the waves surged over the signal bridge, and hit the ship from the side. From the shipowner down to the crew, all the Lianxing personnel were mobilized for the rescue work. They risked going forward, because if they faced the wind, the ship would be broken. If they retreated, they would be immediately overturned. The gale and giant waves came like overturning mountains and seas. The ship rolled to thirty degrees on the sea surface. The cabin surface was no longer safe to stand on. There were more than 20 passengers in the ship. After this unprecedented crisis, they all resigned themselves to certain death. The hurricane lasted twelve hours, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. They were driven from 33 degrees north latitude to 35 degrees north latitude. Thanks to the joint efforts of the shipowner and crew, they managed to escape the hurricane circle. However, the shipowner's outdoor structures were destroyed by the waves, and many of the oil drums in the large cabin were broken due to the hull’s constant rolling. It was not until the evening before last that they safely arrived in Shanghai. It was truly a fortunate escape. Yesterday, the shipowner reported to the company, which sent personnel to inspect the ship. The damaged parts need to be repaired slightly.</p>
<p>Pingji: The Pingji ship of the Zhidong Company in this port sailed from Shanghai to Yantai, Tianjin, etc. The ship was loaded with miscellaneous grains. The ship also encountered a hurricane when it reached the Shandong Sea. The ship was battered by wind and waves for more than ten hours. Because the ship braved the waves forward, fighting against the storm, the machinery engine was damaged. The ship then sailed from the Yellow Sea to the Rongcheng Bay Strait and anchored for repairs. When the Lianxing sailed out and encountered the wind, the Pingji was having its machinery broken by the strong winds and waves. The ship is still under repair.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Special News from the Shipping Industry <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Transporting Saltpeter to Fujian to Blast Mountains: The Fujian Provincial Government is constructing an upstream highway to facilitate bandit suppression, troop movement, and traffic development. The work is already underway. However, the upstream areas of Fujian are mountainous, and to build the highway, mountains must be blasted through to create a level road. The provincial government has decided to blast the mountains obstructing the highway. It has sent Zhou Zhongsan of the Fuzhou Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to Shanghai to purchase 5,000 kilograms of saltpeter for blasting mountain roads. He will be ordered to transport it to Fujian for use as soon as possible. To transport this saltpeter, the Fujian Provincial Government sent a telegram to the Sanbei Company in Shanghai yesterday, instructing Commissioner Zhou to contact the company to arrange for loading and shipping. It is planned to ship it to Fujian tomorrow to be received by the Highway Construction Department.</p>
<p>The National Goods Conference Reduces Fees, but River Steamer Prices Rise, Causing Panic in the National Goods Industry. The cost of goods such as galoshes, thermos bottles, and enamelware is less than 100 yuan per box, but the freight costs more than 100 yuan, causing national goods to stop being loaded into Sichuan from February 10th for 40 days. It is distressing to see inferior goods taking the opportunity to enter the market. Because the new agreement on increased river steamer fees is about to be extended for six months, Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company, as a shipping merchant, should also consider society. Various industries expressed that they could not agree with such a large increase in national goods freight. Yesterday, Mr. Yu invited representatives from various national goods industries and representatives from the seven river steamer companies to a meeting at the Shipping Club. The two sides directly discussed the inappropriately increased prices and reduced them one by one according to the cost of the goods, dividing them into different levels to avoid driving away customers and helping inferior goods to be sold in Sichuan. The two sides are currently negotiating the new freight rates, and all prices are expected to be revised by the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Pilot Association Responds to the Chamber of Commerce, Pilot Examinations are Difficult to Hold Temporarily <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pilot Management Committee previously received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting to hold pilot examinations in preparation for the recovery of pilotage rights. After submitting it for discussion, it specifically replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Currently, the original pilots in Songhu are already very busy and there are no vacancies. It is necessary to recruit pilot trainees. As for maritime pilots from Tongsha to Shanghai, there are currently only two vacancies that can be filled. The recruitment of pilot trainees is also difficult because of ongoing negotiations with the Shanghai Pilot Association, which have not yet been finalized. The Committee is currently considering the total number of pilots needed for various pilotage services in this area. Once this issue is resolved and pilot trainees need to be recruited, we will inform you and hold competitive examinations to fill the vacancies. The reason why the pilot examinations cannot be held at this time is hereby communicated to you."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Xing Zhigang Petitions for the Construction of a Public Justice Wharf <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the western shipping merchants in Pudong, submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works yesterday, requesting that it assist in the approval and, together with the Bureaus of Finance and Public Utilities, allocate funds to construct a public and just wharf to maintain commerce and facilitate transportation. It stated, "The Wanyu, Gongyi, Yongsheng, Dongjiadu, and South Guild Hall wharves in the South City have long been the gathering places for ships from various towns and townships in Pudong West, Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties, and the busiest ports for the loading and unloading of goods for various businesses along the inner and outer roads of the South City. Now, the Wanyu Wharf has been suddenly abolished due to the construction of a rented warehouse. Not only can the ships and passengers originally docked at the port not load and unload, but the newly built municipal houses on the street have few visitors. Commerce has suddenly changed and plummeted. Therefore, the issue of the existence or abolition of a port directly affects the prosperity or decline of commerce, and indirectly affects the income of the municipal treasury and land taxes. The matter is extremely important and significant. The Bureau has been aware of this and submitted it to the 244th Municipal Council meeting for discussion. It was decided to designate the three Bureaus of Public Works, Finance, and Public Utilities to plan the addition of a public wharf near the Wanyu Wharf, draw up plans, and estimate the price. In October of last year, the Municipal Government issued Directive No. 7756, stating, 'All the submitted documents are noted. Regarding the addition of a public wharf to the Gongyi Wharf site, since the price has been assessed and according to the opinion of the Finance Bureau, the total should be within 10,000 yuan. Save expenses and allocate funds when the land value tax is received.' The review is considered appropriate and should be handled as proposed. Now that the land value tax has been levied for some time, and funds are available, the construction of the wharf is essential to maintain transportation in the four townships and the transportation of commerce. There should be no delay. Therefore, it is requested that the Bureau approve the decision, and together with the Bureaus of Finance and Public Utilities, allocate funds to construct a public and just wharf to maintain the transportation of thousands of ships and people from the townships and develop the business of various businesses in the South City."</p>

<p>The Kalachakra Initiation Dharma Assembly, after being initiated by Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and non-governmental celebrities Duan Qirui, Xu Shiying, etc., the Panchen Lama has also agreed to go to Hangzhou to set up an altar and initiate the Dharma Assembly. It is heard that the assembly will be held in Hangzhou on April 18th. To facilitate the process, a telegram was sent on the 14th to Chairman Lu of Zhejiang Province, asking him to join the initiators and take care of it locally. The office of the assembly received a reply from Chairman Lu yesterday, stating, "Your telegram is received with respect. The Dharma Assembly is aimed at eliminating disasters and praying for blessings. It is deeply admired. Since I am the local host, I will do my best to provide assistance, so there is no need to worry about the title." It is also heard that the association will hold a standing committee meeting at 4 p.m. today to discuss the progress of the event.</p>

<p>Effective April 1st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that although the domestic telegraph code is still perfect, there are still omissions in the application of the code. To facilitate users, four characters have been added: (1) The code for 壋 is 8250; (2) The code for 琱 is 8874; (3) The code for 砟 is 8895; (4) The code for 郾 is 9251. The new codes will be effective from April 1st. The Ministry ordered the various telegraph offices in this port to comply yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Gu Jigao Lectures on the Silver Problem <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association of this port, in view of the fact that the problem of rising silver prices is closely related to our country's finances and national economy, specially invited Gu Jigao, an economics expert, to lecture on the significance of this problem and the countermeasures that our country should take at the United General Association yesterday. People from industrial and commercial circles went to listen to the lecture in large numbers. More than 50 people, including Li Zhaohuan, Cao Yunxiang, and Pan Yangyao, attended. The speech was recorded by Bingxun Stenography, and the gist of the speech was that the United States' raising of silver prices is unfavorable to our government finances, agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, and international trade. Although it may be slightly beneficial to the repayment of foreign debts, the gains do not outweigh the losses. As for the countermeasures, there are temporary and permanent solutions. The former is not discussed because the government has already made considerable preparations. The permanent countermeasures can be divided into three types: (1) Change to a managed silver standard so that the purchasing power of silver is controlled by us to facilitate domestic production; (2) Change to a gold standard. Because world prices have already risen, our country's prices will also rise after the change to gold, and production will develop; (3) Improve production technology, management, and monetary reform should be carried out simultaneously.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau believes that meat is a daily necessity and is closely related to the health of consumers. It is a matter that should be inspected and supervised by the health administration. The pre- and post-slaughter inspections of pork, beef, and mutton sold in the city have been carried out for many years. However, although the regulations for inspecting meat entering the city were promulgated by the Municipal Government in October 1910, meat merchants have repeatedly requested a delay due to misunderstandings. On March 15, 1933, the Municipal Government issued an order stating that, in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, this inspection is aimed at eliminating diseased meat entering the city and maintaining public health. Before the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has formulated measures for the domestic sales inspection of goods, it should be temporarily approved. The Health Bureau, together with the Social Affairs, Finance, and Public Security Bureaus, consulted and approved the implementation of the inspection of meat entering the city from April 1st. The Health Bureau appointed doctors to inspect meat entering the city at the main land and water entrances, such as Shanghai North Station, South Station, Wusong, Xin Jing, and South Huangpu. They also ordered the inspectors to provide convenience to the transporters within the scope of the fixed regulations. Therefore, all pickled and fresh meat sold in the city has been inspected. The inspection fee is only 10 cents per 50 kilograms. Once the scientific inspection proves that the meat is unhygienic due to being from livestock with epidemic diseases, it will be confiscated according to regulations.</p>

(6) Other routine cases. Finally, Committee Member Kong Xiangxi suggested that in the future, all positions in the association's various subcommittees and staff would be filled by female comrades, because child welfare would not be effective unless it attracted the attention and participation of the general public. Therefore, there are many participants in child welfare in Europe and the United States, while there are very few participants in China. It is heard that this case has been approved by the Executive Committee and submitted to the Staff Association for research. In addition, the association is currently trying to rescue young prostitutes who are forced into prostitution due to economic oppression. In addition, a special issue of the Children's Day will be published in the April issue of "Modern Parents Monthly" to arouse the love and care of parents across the country for child welfare. The establishment of local branches, in addition to Peiping and Nanjing, which can be officially established in the near future, will be formed in Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Guangzhou, etc. within two years.</p>

<p>Detective Liu Shaotian is Also Shot by Mistake</p>
<p>Wounded Thief Sent to Hospital Awaiting Recovery Before Interrogation</p>
<p>Deng Shaonong, a 36-year-old Cantonese man, lives at 7 Baoxing Lane, North Henan Road, in the Public Concession. He is a small owner of the Pudong Xin Sanlin Company and also a comprador at the Dongyang Wharf. His wife, Ms. Shen, is 33 years old, and his concubine, Ms. Zheng, is 28 years old. Both have children and the family is quite wealthy. Unexpectedly, it was coveted by bandits. At about 9:40 a.m. yesterday, when Deng Shaonong had not yet gotten up, four bandits wearing black cloth jackets and trousers suddenly appeared outside the back door. Three of the bandits had pistols, and one bandit stepped forward to knock on the door. At that time, only the hired maid, Jiang Ma, was sweeping and cleaning downstairs. Hearing the knock, she</p>
<p>went to open the door and asked the bandits what was the matter. The bandits claimed to be from Pudong and had important business to see Mr. Deng. The maid thought it was a regular visitor and did not suspect anything. She allowed them to enter. Unexpectedly, the bandits ordered one bandit to guard the back door, one bandit to watch Jiang Ma, and two bandits rushed upstairs and broke into Deng's bedroom. They woke the victim and frightened him into silence. Deng, caught off guard, had to let them search and rob. After about half an hour, the bandits began to flee with the stolen goods. Deng Shaonong, seeing this, quickly put on his clothes and chased out, and chased after them with the maid. He shouted "Catch the robbers!" The bandits, realizing things were not good, desperately fled north. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits, in a panic, accidentally stumbled and fell to the ground, and the pistol he was carrying fell out. At this time, the maid Jiang Ma had caught up. Seeing the opportunity, she stepped forward to hold down the bandit, grabbed the gun on the ground, and handed it to Deng Shaonong. Deng then fired a shot at the bandit, hitting him in the abdomen. Blood flowed freely. At the same time, the nearby patrol officers arrived and arrested the wounded bandit and took him to the police station. According to the bandit, his name is Wang Axiao, from Jiangbei, 33 years old. When asked further, he was unable to speak clearly due to his injuries. He was taken to the hospital by car for treatment and will be interrogated after he recovers. The remaining bandits escaped and the police station has sent detectives to pursue them. However, when the victim Deng Shaonong shot at the bandits, Detective Liu Shaotian of the police station happened to be sipping tea upstairs in a nearby teahouse. Hearing the alarm, Liu quickly chased out of the teahouse. Seeing the bandits running away, he planned to draw his gun to pursue and arrest them. Unexpectedly, the victim saw him and thought he was an accomplice of the bandits. He also shot Liu in the leg. As a result, Detective Liu was accidentally wounded and fell to the ground. Fortunately, the patrol officers realized the mistake and rushed to report it to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent a car to rush Detective Liu to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor and there was no major problem. The amount of losses is difficult to calculate, but the victim claims that it is a very large amount.</p>

<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, based on the declaration of various organizations for the organization of the Xu Case Committee published in various newspapers on January 22, believes that it insults the court and suspects of obstructing official duties. On the 14th of this month, it summoned 12 members of the Xu Case Committee to court. After questioning by Prosecutor Zhong Qing, the court ordered Wang Hanliang, Ye Jiaxing, Li Ruzhang, Wang Honghui, Xue Guangqian, and five others to submit a written guarantee of 300 yuan each. However, the questioning was completed late in the evening, and they were instructed to submit the guarantee later. Yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in the business community, acted as the guarantor.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu also advised the representatives of various sectors to handle the Special District Court with care, as it was established through an agreement obtained by the Shanghai citizens at a great price. He urged them not to act too aggressively so as not to provide an excuse for foreigners. He believes that the officials of the court will also understand the situation and will not do too much.</p>

<p>Public Buses to Start Operating Next Month</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter heard that the South Shanghai public buses would start operating next month and visited Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. Director Xu was out on official business and was received by Zhang Dengyi, Chief of the Fourth Section of the Bureau and Director of the South Shanghai Public Bus Management Office. He was informed of the following details:</p>
<h3 id="e149">Preparations <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, the Bureau, in view of the importance of transportation in South Shanghai, and at a time when the municipal treasury was extremely tight, negotiated a credit loan with foreign merchants, which was agreed upon by both parties and approved by the superiors. Preparations were then started. A total of 16 vehicles have been ordered from foreign merchants and will first run on the Longhua to West Gate and Round City routes. The factory site is located at the old site of the former South Shanghai Public Bus Company, which is also to save expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Opening Date <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Currently, all internal staff have been appointed, and drivers will soon be recruited. Most vehicles are nearly completed, and the Xieqiao factory site has also been re-arranged. The bus stops remain in their original locations, but the station signs have been replaced with clearer and more noticeable ones. Therefore, the opening ceremony is hoped to be held on April 1st. However, if the project requires a slight delay, the service should definitely be operational by April 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Consideration for Travelers <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of our bureau in launching the Shanghai-Nanhui public bus service is to serve the public. The route is more profitable, while the Longhua-Ximen line only sees better business around the Qingming Festival each year, with very little activity during other times. Therefore, this line is expected to be loss-making. However, given that private buses have been setting high prices and taking advantage of rainy days since the suspension of the Shanghai-Nanhui public bus service, causing great inconvenience to travelers, our bureau cannot effectively regulate them. Therefore, to consider the needs of travelers, our bureau has had to sacrifice and restore traffic on this route.</p>

<p>There are currently sixteen vehicles, each with a load capacity of three and a half tons, which is one ton more than those operated by commercial entities. The cost per vehicle is approximately eight thousand two hundred yuan. The upper part of the vehicle body is painted in ivory color, the lower part in green, and the waistline is decorated with black and white squares.</p>

<p>Inspectors Recognized the Detective and Called Out "Head!"</p>
<p>Gamblers Heard the Warning and Had Nowhere to Escape</p>
<p>—Yesterday's Verdict: Each Person Fined—</p>
<p>Detectives Lu Dagong and Xu Shucheng of the General Patrol Room discovered that a gambling den had been set up in Room 120, 4th floor, of the Cotton Cloth Exchange at No. 260 Avenue Edward VII. The gambling activities involved a large number of people and significant amounts of money, with comprehensive security measures in place. After several investigations, they led a group of detectives in plain clothes into the building at 4:30 PM the day before. The Exchange inspector, Xu Fusheng, recognized Detective Xu and shouted "Head!", alerting the gamblers that the police were present. The gamblers quickly hid their gambling money in their pockets. The two detectives, realizing that concealment was no longer possible, ordered the door to be guarded and telegraphed the patrol room to dispatch additional officers. The police arrested the head of the operation, Zhu Mengxiong; inspector Xu Fusheng; the person in charge of managing money, Lin Fuqing; as well as Wu Linchun, Wang Zeyi, Sun Liangeng, Shen Maosheng, Han Renji, Fan Jinfu, Chen Sanqian, Lu A'er, Chen Apin, and a total of thirty-one people. They also confiscated one set of Pai Gow tiles, one set of Mahjong tiles, one set of "Dig Flower" cards, and gambling chips. All were taken back to the patrol room. Except for fourteen individuals who were released on bail of one hundred yuan each, the rest were temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Patrol Room's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the circumstances and requested that the defendants be punished separately for the crime of gambling. After Judge Zhan Liangce questioned them one by one, Zhu Mengxiong was sentenced to a fine of sixty yuan, Xu Fusheng to a fine of thirty yuan, those released on bail to a fine of fifty yuan each, and the rest to a fine of thirty yuan each. The gambling equipment was confiscated.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Fuquan and his wife, renowned overseas Chinese merchants from Gorontalo Port, Celebes, Dutch East Indies, have long admired Shen Bao as the most prestigious and historically significant news organization. On their return to their homeland to inspect industry, they recently requested Mr. Liu Shimu to accompany them on a visit. They were guided through each department by Mr. Huang Jiping, a colleague at the newspaper, who provided detailed explanations. Ms. Li translated into Malay. Mr. Wang expressed great satisfaction, saying to the translator before leaving that such a large newspaper with such perfect facilities was unprecedented in southern Asia and that he was truly fortunate to have witnessed it. He said that he would promote the newspaper to foreigners upon his return and encourage overseas Chinese to subscribe. He also expressed hope that the Shen Bao would allocate more space to report on the news of overseas Chinese who are working hard for their homeland. This would reduce the sense of disconnect between the country and its overseas compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Ministry of Railways Plans Cold Storage Facilities on Various Lines <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Decision Made to Proceed in Three Phases</p>
<p>Two Lines Listed in the First Phase</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that because China's railways lack cold storage transportation facilities, fresh fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, etc., produced along the various railway lines cannot be sold in other regions to regulate supply and demand. This has led to the decline of the agricultural economy and hindered the development of railway operations. To address the issue of regulating the people's food supply and supporting agricultural production, and at the same time open up a new avenue for railway business, a plan has been proposed to establish a cold storage system across the national railways. However, due to the large construction costs, which are difficult to raise in the short term, it has been decided to proceed in three phases. The full text of the construction plan is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Construction in Three Phases The national railway cold storage project will be carried out in three phases. The first phase of construction includes: (1) cold storage warehouses in Shanghai and Nanjing; (2) an ice station in Hangzhou; (3) ten refrigerated cars. The total cost is approximately 560,000 yuan. The second phase of construction includes: (1) cold storage warehouses in Tianjin and Qingdao; (2) ice stations in Beijing, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Haizhou; (3) twenty-two refrigerated cars. The total cost is approximately 680,000 yuan. The third phase of construction includes: (1) cold storage warehouses in Guangzhou and Hankou; (2) an ice station in Wuchang; (3) twelve refrigerated cars. The total cost is approximately 550,000 yuan. The total construction cost for the three phases is over 1.8 million yuan. As for the construction steps, Shanghai is a distribution center for fresh goods. The output of fresh goods along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines is extremely large. Moreover, it is close to the capital, making supervision and management easier. It is appropriate to implement the project there first to serve as a model. Therefore, it is listed in the first phase and completed first. The second phase is an expansion period. To promote the joint transportation of fresh goods, it is necessary to continue the project on connected railway lines. Furthermore, the capital's ferry service is already open, making north-south transportation more convenient. Therefore, the cold storage facilities on the Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Longhai lines are included in the second phase. Two years later, the Yuehan Railway will also be completed, forming a continuous line with the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which is an important north-south route. Therefore, it is included in the third phase for completion. The first-phase plan includes cold storage warehouses in Shanghai and Nanjing, an ice station in Hangzhou, and ten refrigerated cars. The detailed plan is as follows: (1) The construction site for the Shanghai cold storage warehouse is selected in the empty space within the Maigen Road freight station. The site is located southwest of the Maigen station, west of the Suzhou River. Goods can be unloaded directly from cargo ships at the warehouse. To the south is a railway track connecting to the Maigen Road station, and further south is Kangji Road, which provides access to the city center via Jinling Road, Xinzha Road, or Xinmin Road. Therefore, the location is very convenient for railway, waterway, and land transportation. The cold storage warehouse occupies a length of sixty-five meters and a width of forty meters. However, the initial construction only occupies half of the land. The warehouse will be doubled in size in the future when business develops. The original track in front of the warehouse will be replaced with new sleepers and ballast to accommodate the parking of trains. The warehouse has a total of five floors. The first floor has a large storage room for handling goods transportation, a workers' rest area, and an ice-making area and machine room. Below is the cold storage cellar. The second and third floors are the main storage areas, each divided into four cold rooms for the separate storage of fresh goods. The fourth and fifth floors are rental warehouses, each divided into four cold rooms. The rooms are separated by round iron bars and wire mesh to create small storage spaces of four and six square meters for merchants to rent. The machine room is connected to the warehouse and located in the northeast of the warehouse. The lower floor includes a machine room, equipment room, repair room, and materials storage area. The upper floor houses offices and a transformer room. The machine room is equipped with two argon refrigeration units, capable of providing sufficient capacity for the entire cold storage warehouse and ice-making area to produce 15.52 tons of ice per day. (2) The Nanjing cold storage warehouse is selected on the empty land next to the freight warehouse at the Xiaguan Station as the construction base. The warehouse is twenty-five meters long and twenty meters wide, covering an area of ​​500 square meters. There are two railway tracks to the northwest of the site. It is planned to set up a unloading platform there in the future, which will be very convenient for parking freight cars. There is a main road to Tokyo that leads directly to the city center. To save on start-up costs, only three floors will be built first. The various facilities are similar to those in the Shanghai warehouse. (3) The Hangzhou ice station will build an ice-making room next to the station, equipped with two argon refrigeration units for ice-making. (4) The ten refrigerated cars are forty-ton, eight-wheeled cars. The outer length of the car body is 11.2 feet, the width is 2.8 feet, and the height is 4.2 feet, with a load capacity of 10 metric tons. Each car is equipped with two iron ice boxes at both ends, each storing about 600 kilograms of crushed ice.</p>
<p>Profitable Operation After the completion of the first phase of construction, the estimated operating income is: (1) Shanghai warehouse: about 150,000 yuan; (2) Nanjing warehouse: about 90,000 yuan; (3) Hangzhou ice station: about 30,000 yuan, totaling 280,000 yuan. After deducting operating expenses, machine and warehouse depreciation, and investment interest of more than 220,000 yuan, the surplus can be more than 50,000 yuan. However, the tonnage of fresh goods transported will definitely be more than the current estimated number after the cold storage is established. Therefore, the actual profit should increase.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Melting National Currency into Silver Ingots <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Although Legally Not Punishable</p>
<p>The Judge Sternly Reprimanded in Court</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance officially issued an order to abolish silver smelters in Shanghai, most people who engaged in the silver smelting industry have been unemployed or have changed careers. A person from Shaoxing named Qi Chufa also belonged to the silver smelting industry. Recently, he set up the "Duan Tai" business at No. 20 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road, and No. 41 Tiantong Road, specializing in the business of melting raw silver. The Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this and believed that Qi and others were melting national currency into silver ingots, violating the order of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, they, together with the detectives from the Concession Police, arrested Qi Chufa and six others, and confiscated 879 double cents, 26 silver ingots, 62 pounds of broken silver, and four molds. They were all sent to the First Special Court. In addition to applying for transfer of the case, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also reported to the Ministry of Finance for review. Later, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, presented the order from the Ministry of Finance during the previous court hearing, requesting a review. However, Jiang Baolian, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, argued that there were no explicit legal provisions for such cases, making it difficult to prosecute. Jiang Yiping, the attorney representing Qi and others, stated that Qi and others had not violated the law and should be released. The court ordered a review and filed the case. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi delivered the following verdict at the Eighth Criminal Court: "Qi Chufa, Qian Guoxun, Chen Jinshan, and Shen Yushu's act of privately smelting silver ingots against the order is highly inappropriate. In addition to being sternly reprimanded in court, the molds should be immediately destroyed, and Qi Chufa should be responsible for requesting the Central Mint to recast the silver ingots into silver coins in accordance with Article 1 of the Silver Standard Coinage Ordinance. Zhou Huilin and Tong Dasheng are innocent and released."</p>

<p>Using a Feather Duster as a Weapon</p>
<p>The Adopted Daughter's Injuries Proven to Be Real</p>
<p>—Verdict: Fine of Ten Yuan, Girl Returned to Maternal Uncle—</p>
<p>A woman named Chen Fan, from Changzhou, residing at No. 20 Wusong Road, has been mistreating her eight-year-old adopted daughter, Ge Gengnan, constantly beating her and causing injuries all over her body. At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, she again used a feather duster to strike the girl's hands and legs severely. Gengnan, in pain, ran into the street crying, where she was spotted by an elderly woman from Suzhou, Li Lushi, who lived nearby. Li took her home, learned the details of what happened, and gave the girl lunch out of pity. Later, she planned to send her back home with gentle words of advice, but the girl said that she would be beaten to death if she went back and pleaded for help. Therefore, Li reported the situation to a Chinese detective on patrol nearby. Detective Wu Deyi took her to the Hongkou Patrol Room, reported to the head detective, and sent the girl to Tongren Hospital, where the injuries were confirmed. He ordered Detective Wu to secretly arrest Chen Fan and send her, along with a feather duster, to the detention center. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, recounted the events and claimed that the defendant said in the patrol room that she beat Gengnan because she stole money. He presented the injury report from the feather duster for examination. Li Lushi testified about what happened, but the girl, Gengnan, was afraid of the defendant and did not speak clearly. The court ordered Chen Fan to be taken out of the courtroom before asking the girl, "Did your mother (i.e., the defendant) beat my hands and legs with a feather duster for taking a silver coin to buy sesame cakes and candies?" Chen Fan confessed that Gengnan had been adopted from her mother, Zhao Guiying, two years ago and that the girl had stolen silver coins three times, so she beat her. She added that Gengnan's maternal uncle, Zhao Yonggen, was in court and could be asked. Zhao testified that he was from Wuxi and that Gengnan was indeed his niece. His sister, Guiying, was being detained in court for opium use after being arrested by the Hongkou Patrol Room. He asked that the girl be handed over to him to return to their hometown to be raised by his mother, to avoid being violently beaten by Chen Fan. The court ordered the judicial police to bring the girl's mother, Guiying (i.e., Ge Zhao), from the detention center to the courtroom. After verifying that Gengnan was indeed her daughter, she said that the defendant should not have beaten the girl so badly and asked that she be handed over to her brother, Yonggen, to be taken back to their hometown. Upon hearing this, Chen Fan became furious and pointed at Ge Zhao, saying, "If you want to punish me, I will tell the truth and confess that Gengnan was sold to me as a daughter for fifty yuan. At that time, she said that if the girl was not good to you, you could beat her as you pleased. Please, Your Honor, be aware!" Ge Zhao admitted to receiving forty yuan previously and giving the girl to the defendant as her daughter, but she did not tell her to beat her severely and requested that the girl be taken back to their hometown by her younger brother, Yonggen, etc. Judge Xiao Xiefei sentenced Chen Fan to a fine of ten yuan and ordered the girl, Gengnan, to be taken by her maternal uncle, Zhao Yonggen.</p>

<p>Abandoning the Old for the New Led to the Poisonous Act</p>
<p>A Strict Investigation Is Underway to Find the Murder Weapon</p>
<p>The Madams and Pimps Were Released</p>
<p>On the morning of the twelfth of this month, at 8:00 AM, a tragic murder occurred at the brothel located at No. 15 Hengmao Lane, Bassen Bridge, Mintini Yin Road, in the French Concession. The prostitute Wang Guixiang and her patron, Mr. Wang, were both brutally attacked. The prostitute Wang died on the spot, while Mr. Wang suffered severe injuries and was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Patrol Room, along with Head Detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin, and Deputy Detectives Jiang Changwen, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Buguang, Yang Yilong, and others, conducted a thorough investigation. They learned that Mr. Wang's real name was Wang Yuhe, also known as Runjiu, from Shandong Province, aged forty-eight, residing at No. 227 Xuzhen Road, Xujiahui. The deceased prostitute had borrowed three hundred yuan from Wang Yuhe in June of last year, and they had made a promise to stay together. However, recently, the deceased had a change of heart and planned to go to Wuhu with another patron, a fishmonger. Wang Yuhe learned of this and demanded repayment of the debt. However, the deceased spoke disrespectfully, angering Wang. Overwhelmed with grief and resentment, Wang conceived a murderous plan, willing to die with the deceased. It is said that there was a seven-inch-long pair of scissors hidden in the drawer of the prostitute Wang's room. Since the bloodbath, the scissors have disappeared. Therefore, Chief Inspector Jin is currently ordering a strict investigation to find the murder weapon. The madams and pimps arrested in connection with the case have been cleared of any involvement and released.</p>

A good family creates good children. Therefore, if you want a good society, you must first educate children, especially starting with family education.

<h3 id="e163">Water Outage Dispute at Jingye Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Citizens' Branch Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, Yu Yifeng of Chenghua Company, the owner of Jingye Lane at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangdi Road in the French Concession, hired lawyer Ni Guangzu in March of last year to represent him in claiming to the residents that the water bills were too high and therefore rent needed to be increased. The original rent for each shikumen building was 28 yuan, and for each storefront was 30 yuan, and all were increased by 40%. The residents had no choice but to agree to the rent increase. However, on the 6th of this month, the residents of the lane suddenly received a letter from the French Water and Electricity Company, instructing them to sign a water contract with the company within two days, or the water supply would be cut off and stopped. At the same time, they also received a notice from the landlord that because the water bill was too high, the tenants would be responsible for it. After receiving the letters, the residents felt that they had already increased the rent last year because the landlord claimed the water bill was too high, and it had been a year. The landlord did not understand the residents' difficulties and continued to oppress them. Moreover, at a time when the market was sluggish, all sectors were trying to reduce rent, so they were unwilling to sign a contract with the water and electricity company voluntarily. Because the residents did not sign the contract by the deadline, the company sent people to cut off the water line of the lane yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The residents of the lane had no choice but to elect seven people, including Chen Yazhang, Shi Caizhang, Yuan Chengji, Lu Quanyuan, Yan Jingbai, Xia Xinyuan, and Shen Jinsheng, as representatives to request the Second Special District Municipal Employee Branch to uphold justice and send a letter to the Taxpayers' Association for assistance. The Fifth Branch of the Second Special District City Federation, after receiving the report of the water outage, was afraid of causing a major dispute, so it immediately issued a notice summoning all the committee members of the lane to hold an emergency meeting at the assembly hall of Li Yuan Lane, Lan Weiai Road, at 8:00 PM last night to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Public Concession Board Revises Tent Tax <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shops Still Claim Tax Amount Too High</p>
<p>Citizen Association Issues Notice to Postpone License Application</p>
<p>Shops in the French Concession, which previously paid a tent tax of five jiao per shop annually, had the tax revised last year by the French Public Concession Board. The new tax was calculated based on the area occupied by the shop, at a rate per English foot. This increased the tax to approximately three to five yuan per shop annually, causing opposition from various shops. They requested the Citizen Association of each district to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to discuss remedial measures. The meeting resolved to appoint Vice Chairman Mr. Cheng Zhusun to repeatedly negotiate a solution with the French authorities. Mr. Cheng reported to the association members the outcome of his negotiations: a tax of one yuan per shop annually, with a fixed license fee of five jiao. For double-fronted shops, an additional one yuan would be added per front, with similar increments for additional fronts. However, this was only a verbal agreement, and the French authorities continued to collect taxes according to the increased method, based on English feet. Therefore, the dispute was not fundamentally resolved. The Citizen Associations continued to request the Taxpayers' Association to discuss countermeasures and sent a letter to the French Public Concession Board requesting a reduction in the tax. After Mr. Cheng's repeated efforts to negotiate, the French authorities decided to revise the tax fee and agreed to publish it in writing in the Chinese Gazette of the French Public Concession Board. Unexpectedly, the list of various taxes published in the January 1934 Gazette showed that the fixed tent license fee was seven jiao per paper, and the tax fee was one yuan and five jiao per shop annually, or three yuan for a double shop, with similar increments for additional fronts. This was still inconsistent with the original negotiated amount. As the weather has recently become gradually hotter, shops are in the process of applying for licenses. The French Public Concession Board is still calculating fees based on English feet and collecting fees according to the newly defined method. The minimum cost per shop is two yuan and two jiao annually (including the fixed tax), which is an increase of seven jiao compared to the originally agreed fixed tax of five jiao and tax fee of one yuan. Furthermore, the calculation per front is one yuan and five jiao, an increase of five jiao. Thus, the license fee has not been reduced. Many who are unaware of the true situation are paying fees calculated based on English feet, and they have repeatedly inquired with the Citizen Associations about why the fees have not been reduced and why they are being collected according to the newly defined revised method, requesting further negotiations. Upon receiving these reports, the Citizen Associations have forwarded the information to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, based on the figures published in the French Public Concession Board's Gazette, to continue negotiations with the French authorities for a reduction. They have also notified all shops to temporarily postpone applying for tent licenses until a definitive solution is reached, after which they can apply for licenses and pay taxes.</p>

<p>One Dies... One in Critical Condition</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, two young men suddenly arrived at the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road and requested lodging. The hotel provided them with Room 70. One of the men was Guo Xiwen, age 22, and the other was Xu Kangtai, age 22, both from Chongming. They paid six yuan for the room at the time. At around 10:00 PM that night, they closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the tea server on the floor heard moaning sounds from the room and became suspicious. He immediately opened the door and saw the two men writhing in bed, their faces pale. A small amount of opium was found beside their pillows. It was discovered that they had taken poison. The server quickly reported to the accounting office, who notified the Lao Zha Police Station. Officers were dispatched to rush the two men to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, Guo Xiwen died en route due to severe poisoning. His body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. Xu Kangtai regained consciousness briefly after being treated at the hospital. He claimed that they had each swallowed one yuan's worth of raw opium. They were both in the Nanhua goods business and had been driven to this by economic pressure. He soon lapsed back into unconsciousness. It is difficult to say whether his life can be saved.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Honors for Officer Xu of the Water Patrol Team <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>—Merchants and Residents Unanimously Appeal for Recognition—</p>
<p>The second squadron of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team is stationed between the Xinzha Bridge and Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, with jurisdiction extending from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Zhaojiadu Zhongshan Bridge. However, the river surface in this area is narrow, with sails moving back and forth like shuttles, and the riverbanks are densely packed with sampans. Especially during the winter low tide season, traffic congestion often occurs. The area is strategically important and notoriously difficult to patrol. Since Officer Xu Chizhi took charge of the team, he has worked hard to rectify the situation, paying particular attention to water traffic and maritime security. As a result, there have been no kidnapping or theft cases in the more than a year since he took office, and water traffic has been well-organized, without any congestion. Therefore, merchants and residents on both banks, such as the Rice Association, Fuxin Flour Mill, Inland River Shipping Association, Siming Shipping Association, and Coal and Stone Transport Association, are all very pleased. They admire Officer Xu and have jointly appealed to the relevant authorities for recognition. They also intend to express their appreciation in some other way.</p>

Its design is similar to European and American coffee pots, and it can maintain heat for up to forty-eight hours, making it more convenient than ordinary thermos bottles. It comes in various sizes and specifications, and the decorations and accessories are exquisite, beautiful, and purely domestic. Xu Rongfang applied for a patent to the Ministry of Industry, which was approved by the Ministry of Industry's Technology Review Committee on October 12 of last year. The patent was granted for five years, and the committee noted that the bottle was very practical and that the glass tube in the lower part of the bottle was unique to this insulated bottle. It is learned that Mr. Xu has raised a large amount of capital and is preparing to set up a factory to manufacture the bottles. It is expected that the product will be a sensation when it is launched, and its convenience will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Further Discussion on</p>
<p>Steps in Literary Study</p>
<p>Writing and Others (3)</p>
<p>The above has presented three propositions for studying literature, and we have already discussed (1) What is the literature we need? and (2) How to read literary works. Today, we will continue the discussion: (3) How to create? We hope readers will also refer to the several essays on literature that we have published previously. Editor</p>
<p>(3) How to create? Humans have a desire to express themselves, and the desire to create for those who study literature is a natural requirement.</p>
<p>However, the general public has two opposing and equally erroneous views regarding creation. These two views are most likely to hinder the development of creative power and must be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>1. Fear of Creation. Some people see creation as very mysterious, as something that ordinary people cannot hope for. This is not right. The reason we see it this way is because we see creation as purely a technical issue, the exclusive domain of scholars and literati who have studied for many years and possess literary cultivation. Technique is necessary, but technique is not the main condition for creation; the main thing is content. Technique will improve as your creative life progresses. A child who has been beaten will "cry," a person who has been wronged will "sigh," and dockworkers will hum "Hey ho!" when they are carrying goods. These simple emotions are the elements of literature. We are living a difficult life, and our daily life is a very good creation, just waiting for us to honestly describe it in words. If you are an apprentice, why can't you write about your daily life of being scolded and beaten and pouring out slop buckets and washing pipe ash? If you are a machine worker, why can't you shout out the pain you suffer from the factory owner, the foreman, and the machine? If you were born into a declining farming family, you can write about the sadness of decline; if you are unemployed or out of school, you can write about the panic and desolation of unemployment or being out of school. Moreover, humans are thinking animals, and in such a life, we always have our own hopes, we have the future of our lives, and these are also the content of creation. We already have a rich life, so why should we be afraid of creation? What is so mysterious about creation? Is it because scholars and literati write about "azure skies," and we can't change it to "blue skies"?</p>
<p>2. Chaotic Creation. Mr. Shen Congwen, a now famous literary figure and professor—this name should be familiar to everyone—once had this idea about how to write a novel: that writing a novel only requires random thoughts and random writing. Is this right? We cannot assume it is right just because he is a professor and a literary figure; it is not right. Such random thinking and random writing can only be done by literati who treat creation as entertainment and by literary craftsmen who treat creation as a wealthy person's enjoyment. We should not do this. We want to think, but we are not fantasizing. Our thinking must be based on the society in which we live and closely tied to our own lives. We want to write, but not aimless moaning; our writing is to cry out the suffering of life and expose the evils of society. Therefore, our creation is not for the sake of creation, but for the sake of social life. Not only must our attitude toward creation be serious, but especially our lives must be serious. That is to say, we must not be manipulated by fate and float along with the world, but we need to combine our lives with all the forces that promote society. Only with a real life can there be creation; random thinking and random writing will never succeed. Don't look at others, just look at Mr. Shen Congwen himself, who has written so many books. Since he ascended to the throne of professor, enjoying a leisurely life and not competing with the world, what else has he been able to write!</p>
<p>In short, the prerequisite for creation is a rich life. We must neither "fear" nor "be chaotic." Our main move is simply to observe society and experience life. With this move, we have completed the preliminary and fundamental work of our creation.</p>
<p>Then, we will talk about the process of composing a creation.</p>
<p>The backbone of a novel or a drama is the story. We are not talking about poetry here because poetry, except for narrative poems and epics, is poetry without a story; it is just a moment of high emotional impact, like the dockworker mentioned earlier who naturally hums the tune of "Hey ho...Hey ho" when working.) When writing, the first thing we must ask ourselves is, in this complex social phenomenon, in this tedious life, which fragment should we extract as the subject of our creation? If this question is resolved, we will organize the extracted fragment through our minds and construct a simple and orderly story. This includes recognizing where the focus of the story should be, that is, what is the central point we are expressing, and how the protagonist should appear in this story. If this step is completed, then we can unhesitatingly use the words we can use to write the story as it is. After writing it well, of course, it cannot be considered a work yet. Then, we can carefully revise it in terms of language and structure. Where we feel the description is insufficient, we must strengthen it; where we feel the description is redundant, we must delete it. The standard of our descriptive technique is concise and clear, that is, to see whether the point or character we want to express in the story has been fully expressed, and whether it can give people a sense of pleasure at a glance when reading. We do not necessarily need those gorgeous words and playful sentences. Moreover, to say it again, we must never focus on those words first when we write.</p>
<p>Looking at the above, regarding how to study literature, at least it can give readers a concept, right? Now, there are two more subordinate questions that we might as well bring up and discuss.</p>
<p>Some readers have written to ask: (1) When studying literature, should one read literary creations first or theory first? (2) Does studying literature require reading social sciences? The answers to these two questions are: (1) Originally, creation and theory are interconnected and should be advanced together. Theory is the guideline for creation, and creation is the backbone of theory. But now all learning has become specialized, and creators and theorists are already working hard on their respective paths, although theorists still cannot but read creations, and creators cannot but understand the preliminary theory, but they each have their own biases. Therefore, to determine this question, readers must first decide whether they are studying literary theory or creation. However, for beginners, we believe it is best to read creations first, because the principles of theory are ultimately derived from creation. (2) In today's society, not only those who study literature, but everyone should have some basic knowledge of social sciences. However, if your life does not allow you to have enough time to read, then at least you must read two books on "dialectical materialism," because this can help you to recognize and analyze society, and even understand the direction in which society is moving and how you should live. For a literary person, in addition to the experience of actual life, this is also a necessary condition for studying literature.</p>

<p>Jinan vs. Huasais at Yiyuan</p>
<p>The Group A football replay between Donghua and Fashang has been set for 3:00 PM today at the China Baseball Field. This group match has become a question mark. The reporter has repeatedly spoken about it. Both Chinese and foreign newspapers have been in an uproar. The Western-language Continental Daily also had a scathing article yesterday, criticizing the authorities of the Western Union Football Association. It is also heard that Fashang is preparing to file a protest, believing that after a game has already been forfeited, why should it be re-entered into the schedule, to curry favor with Donghua? Is it for the sake of ticket sales? It is unknown. We certainly very much hope that Donghua and Fashang will meet again to determine the outcome. For the sake of ticket sales, the Western Union may arrange a friendly match, but we do not want to see it in an illegal order. Today, after Donghua's Tiemen went to the United States and Li Ning was injured, ominous signs abound. Let's see what the result will be.

<p>Defeated by a three-point margin, 25-28</p>
<p>China, the United States, and England to Replay Finals Next Week</p>
<p>The International Basketball Tournament held two women's matches last night at 8 o'clock. The men's championship was decided last Wednesday, with the American team winning with two wins out of two games. Although the Chinese team was eliminated from the men's championship, there was still hope in the women's competition. The Chinese women had previously defeated the United States in their first match and then defeated the Federation in the second. In last night's match, the first game was between the United States and the Federation, and the second game was between China and England. If China had won last night, the championship would have been theirs. Unexpectedly, the Chinese team was defeated by a three-point margin, resulting in a triangular standoff between China, England, and the United States, each with two wins and one loss. A replay between the three countries is needed to determine the championship. It was expected that the United States would defeat the Federation last night. However, the defeat of the Chinese team by England was beyond the expectations of most people. The details of the two matches are recorded below:</p>
<p>United States Defeats the Federation</p>
<p>—26 to 18—</p>
<p>The United States defeated the Federation with ease. In the first quarter, White of the United States opened the scoring, and the Federation struggled for a long time before Marto scored a goal. Shortly after, White scored again, and Bausack of the United States added another goal and two free throws. At the end of the first quarter, the United States led 10-2.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second quarter, Marto of the Federation scored under the basket, raising his hand successfully. Then, Boram scored a free throw and four consecutive points. Marto then scored another single-handed shot. At this point, the Federation took the lead 11-10, turning defeat into victory. The United States seemed to be caught off guard in the second quarter.</p>
<p>However, the Federation's momentum felt weak. At the beginning of the third quarter, relying on the momentum from the previous quarter, Leswana scored a goal first. However, White of the United States then scored two consecutive goals and continued to dominate, leaving the Federation at a loss. In the fourth quarter, the Federation struggled hard, but to no avail. As a result, they were defeated by the United States 26-18.</p>

Observing the four quarters of the match, England committed many fouls. However, Chen Rongming and Yang Sen rarely made their free throws.

<p>Both Sides Defend Tenaciously, Unable to Determine Victory</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua's One Shot Seals the Victory</p>
<p>—A Scene from the Western League Division A Match—</p>
<p>In the Western League Division A soccer match between Donghua and Youyou, the two teams met for the second time yesterday at the Chinese Baseball Field. As a result, Donghua defeated Youyou 1-0, avenging their previous惨败 at Yiyuan. The game was clear and harmonious, and both sides played with extreme caution in both offense and defense. It was not until the last quarter hour that Jiang Shanjing was injured and had to leave the field, and Donghua took the opportunity to score, sealing the victory with a score of 1-0. Only two or three thousand people watched the game.</p>
<p>Equally Matched: Yesterday's match between Donghua and Youyou was truly a case of evenly matched teams, with comparable strength. In addition, both sides played harmoniously, with no violent actions. Therefore, the tension of the game was greatly reduced, and both sides adopted a strict defensive strategy. The game progressed at a constant pace, neither hurried nor relaxed. One could say it was interesting, or one could say it was ordinary.</p>
<p>Two Crises: Donghua kicked off, Wu Shouheng blew the whistle, and with the wind at their backs, they went straight for Youyou. Dai and Li, the two forwards, advanced steadily, but Youyou defended strongly. Chen Jiaqiu, who was reassigned to defense, did not fail in his duty. Although Donghua had many attacks, they were unsuccessful. In the 25th minute, Wan Xianghua skillfully sent a ball from the left corner, which landed right in front of the goal. Xiao Dai saw that it was a good opportunity and took a shot, but Tang Yongchun caught it squarely, and the ball flew into the air. A gust of south wind blew it behind the goal, which was also a surprise. Then, Li Yichen's shot, which could have scored, was withdrawn due to Zhou Guangzhong's offside. These were the notable events of the first half.</p>
<p>Slight Change in the Situation: In the second half, the two sides switched positions, and Youyou had the wind at their backs, which changed the situation. Sun Jinshun was reassigned to center forward, and Youyou also sent their three armies to advance on Donghua. Although Liang Shutang had many opportunities, his headers and kicks were inaccurate and ineffective. The cooperation between Zhong and Xi also often fell short. Donghua returned the favor, with Wan Xianghua being the most active. An Lesheng's weakness made Xiao Wan look much better. With a kick to the right, Jia Youliang could have received it and scored, but suddenly his foot did not extend and he fell. As a result of the siege, the score remained zero-zero.</p>
<p>Final Outcome: With only fifteen minutes remaining in the game, Youyou's defensive line suddenly collapsed. Jiang Shanjing, a key player, suffered a hamstring injury and had to withdraw. Then, Xiao Wan's charge and An Lesheng's misstep led to them冲进 the goal together with the ball. Xiao Tang could only sigh at his failure, and the stalemate was broken. Youyou's counterattack was weakened, and it was also difficult for Donghua to score again. The game ended with this one-to-zero score.</p>

<p>Defeated by a score of twelve to zero</p>
<p>A scene from the Western League Division A soccer match</p>
<p>The Jinan soccer team played against Lax in the Western League Division A match at Yiyuan yesterday and suffered an unprecedented defeat by a large margin of twelve to zero. The team has recently been plagued by the scattering of its key players and has suffered repeated setbacks. Yesterday also happened to be the day of the Jiangda basketball tournament, and both Gu Shangrang and Luo Haiguang went to Beijing to compete, which further affected their strength. However, the team's ability to resist diligently from beginning to end is also commendable. The first half ended with a score of six to zero.</p>
<p>Both armies arrived at Yiyuan, but it was past the legal time. The battle did not begin until 3:10. Jinan was in the east, and Lax was in the west, with their backs to the sun and the wind at their backs, giving them a significant advantage. Jinan kicked off and made a few turns, but the ball was snatched away by Mata. The five forwards were full of energy and continued to attack Jinan's defense. The two defenders, Wen and Lai, scurried around, and Chen Zhenxiang redeployed his troops to assist in the defense. However, after eight minutes, Quekelun broke through the crowd and scored a direct hit. Seven minutes later, Hapei scored again. After that, Jinan's situation became increasingly unfavorable. After thirty minutes, Bauseli's surprise troops rose again and scored a low shot. Quekelun scored a header, making it four to zero. Baoxiu li gained possession of the ball at close range, and after Quekelun made it six to zero, the first half ended.</p>
<p>In the second half, he will comeback with another half dozen Xiao Mei kept the goal, and was very angry. So he flexed his arm and went out, transfer back Fu Hexuan, and he became the right inner forward, hoping to return half of the southeast area to me. But morale was depressed, and the army had no fighting spirit.</p>
<p>In the Inner Palace, the Lax team could be seen纵横裨阖,辟易万人, Jinan did not score after three attacks. Hei Tushi went straight down the edge, and Lai Zuorong was forced into a corner kick, which was opened to the center. Braut waited for a direct hit and headed into the net. After some time, Fu Hexuan only cared about the immediate situation and did not guard his back, and was hit by Braut's hidden arrow. Bauseli was unforgiving and fanned the flames, and Gao Shi benefited as a fisherman. Hapeke also got a twelve-yard opportunity, creating a rare score of one dozen to zero.</p>

<p>Lianglu Football Club's first team accepted the invitation of the Huixi team to hold a friendly match at the McGen Road Stadium on Saturday (March 17). On that day, Huixi gathered the best players from the Xujiahui area, making them a very strong team. However, Lianglu's first team had to use a weaker lineup due to the departure of center Liu Ximeng, left winger Fei Fuxu, and defender Luo Meilun. Yao Liang, Liang Zhongkang, Zhu Qinqiu, Feng Songqian, Huang Jinquan, Shen Bingcong, Tang Wenwei, Zhu Zhenhe, Liu Ximeng, Shen Baochang, Yu Keng</p>
<p>The battle began at 3:30. Lianglu fought against the wind, which was quite difficult. Fortunately, the two defenders, Liang and Zhu, were intelligent and courageous, and the goalkeeper, Yao Liang, was agile and saved many dangerous balls. Furthermore, with the support of the strong center defense line, Yan Yougeng managed to score a goal within fifteen minutes of the start of the game. After being hit, Huixi tried hard to counterattack, but due to Lianglu's effective defense, they were unable to succeed. In the second half, Lianglu adjusted by sending in reserve player Yang Shengwu to play center forward and Yan Yaohua to play right inside forward. Because they had already won one goal and had the advantage of the wind in the second half, they sent in reserve players to practice. As a result, the ball was indeed affected by the wind and often circled around Huixi's side. However, Huixi was not weak either, and quickly retreated the entire team to defend. Lianglu attacked fiercely for a long time, but to no avail. Later, Yang Shengwu became angry and shot powerfully at the goal from 30 yards away. As expected, the ball went into the net, making the score two to zero.

<h3 id="e205">City Education Bureau Issues Order Explaining Names of Private Nursing Schools, <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>and Procedures for Establishing Student Level Standards</p>
<p>Shanghai City Education Bureau issued an order to private nursing schools stating: The bureau had previously found that there were no set regulations regarding the handling of private nursing school names, student levels, and establishment procedures. We had already submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for review and instruction. Now, we have received Directive No. 2328, which states: "Received and noted. Instructions are hereby issued separately as follows: (1) The terms 'senior nursing vocational school' and 'nursing' can be used interchangeably with 'nurse.' (2) Senior nursing or nurse vocational schools must not offer junior-level programs. Those enrolling elementary school graduates should have a five-year graduation requirement. (3) Private school regulations must be followed. (4) The length of study for senior nurse vocational schools is set at three years. Those enrolling elementary school graduates should have a five-year program. The curriculum should refer to the Ministry's outline of subjects and time allocation for vocational schools. The detailed teaching syllabus is being compiled by the Ministry. Please be informed."</p>
<p>This order is hereby issued to instruct the schools to comply accordingly. This order is given.</p>
<p>Attached is the original document from the Shanghai City Education Bureau to the Ministry of Education:</p>
<p>We have found that many hospitals and midwifery schools in the city also operate nursing schools. There are no initial regulations regarding the names of these nursing schools, student levels, and establishment procedures, making it difficult to operate. We hereby submit the following points for instruction: (1) Article 35, Section 4 of the Vocational School Regulations stipulates that senior vocational schools regarding household matters can offer courses in sewing, embroidery, nursing, and midwifery. We have found that private nursing schools in this city and Zhejiang Province are named "nurse," and we are unsure whether this can be equated with the term "nursing" in the regulations, or if it needs to be corrected. This is the first point. (2) According to the Vocational School Regulations, nursing schools should be at the high school level, enrolling junior high school graduates. However, in reality, most nursing school students are elementary school graduates or junior high school dropouts, and their graduation level is equivalent to junior high school. Therefore, private midwifery schools in this city often accept nursing school graduates. The reason for this is that very few junior high school graduates enroll in nursing schools, so they have to lower the requirements to accept elementary school graduates and junior high school dropouts in order to maintain operations. To adapt to the actual situation, can we now implement a flexible approach and allow the establishment of junior nursing schools in addition to senior nursing schools? This is the second point. (3) Regarding the procedures for these nursing schools to apply for establishment, can we temporarily refer to the regulations for establishing midwifery schools in addition to following the revised private school regulations, before receiving and implementing instructions from your ministry? This is the third point. (4) How many years should be the duration of study for nursing school students, what kind of courses should be taught, and how should internships be conducted? This is the fourth point. The following four points are all important issues for establishing nursing schools. We hereby submit this document to your ministry for review and instruction.</p>

<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>Japanese rickshaw pullers all read newspapers. When they are stopped on the street without any business, you often see them holding newspapers and reading them. This is because Japanese rickshaw pullers are all elementary school graduates, so they can understand what they read. In Japan, elementary school education is called compulsory education. If a child reaches school age and does not attend school, their parents will be punished. Therefore, everyone is literate, and there are no "illiterates." There are more newspapers than in our country, and more people read newspapers than in our country. The circulation of newspapers is many times higher than the daily circulation of various newspapers in our country. Looking back at our country, how many "illiterates" are there? Have you ever seen a rickshaw puller reading a newspaper? This is all because elementary school education is not developed. We only know how to hate the Japanese for being aggressive, but we must understand that their education is better than ours, which is why the country is so strong!</p>
<p>According to the 20th's newspaper report, the number of out-of-school children in Jiangsu Province accounts for 86 percent, approximately 4 million. Such a large number of out-of-school children is alarming. If Jiangsu is like this, what about other provinces? Judging from this, it is such a great blessing to be able to carry a schoolbag and go to school every day, thanks to the strength of one's father and brothers! If one does not strive to study hard, is that not being self-defeating?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Children are the masters of China in the future." The responsibility is very heavy, so this year is called "Children's Year." It is a pity that so many out-of-school children cannot be helped for the time being. I hope that all the children who are enrolled in school will become good students, so that our country will have hope in the future.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, Japan won the war against Russia, not crediting it to the army, but to the elementary school teachers, because the elementary school teachers cultivated good elementary school students nationwide, which resulted in the good outcome of winning against Russia. This shows that elementary school students have a great relationship with the country. Gu Tinglin said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every man." I will put it another way: "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every child." Out-of-school children have already lost their chance to study, and children in school should study even harder. The country is in such distress, children, hurry up and strive, hurry up and strive.</p>

<p>— Guo Pinjuan</p>
<p>Children, have you seen the name "Lincoln"? He was the sixteenth president of the United States.</p>
<p>His family was very poor, so when he was little he lived with his parents in a log cabin. Lincoln's bed was just a pile of dry leaves. But he didn't think it was hard, and was happy all day long.</p>
<p>He only went to school for one year, but he loved books and was willing to study hard.</p>
<p>He was very kind to people, and his friends loved him very much.</p>
<p>Later he became a lawyer, and the people of the United States respected and loved him very much. They elected him as the president of the United States. Lincoln then liberated the most painful black slaves in America, which was a great contribution to humanity.</p>
<p>He died in 1865, about seventy years ago.</p>
<p>Children, do you also respect and love Lincoln? You should take him as a model!</p>

<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>"Brother Cheng, I have a question that I am very doubtful about and want to ask you now. It is something I usually see and hear. Will you allow me to ask?" Shi'er was an eleven or twelve-year-old child, and his face showed hope that his brother would allow him.</p>
<p>Standing next to him was a child a little older than him, who was his brother—Cheng'er—who, hearing his younger brother asking him, said, "Shi'er, if you have any questions, ask me. Don't keep them in your heart and be afraid to ask, but I'm afraid I won't be able to answer questions that are too difficult."</p>
<p>Shi'er, hearing that his brother allowed him to ask, began to ask.</p>
<p>"Brother Cheng, every morning when I get up, I see a blood-red sun in the east, gradually rising from the east, and in the afternoon, gradually sinking into the west. Judging from this, the sun can move. But I also heard people say, 'The sun does not move. The sun's rising from the east and sinking into the west is because the earth is rotating.' Brother Cheng! Does the sun move after all? Since the earth rotates, then wouldn't we humans and everything else fall down?"</p>
<p>Cheng'er, because he was very familiar with this natural phenomenon, said very fluently.</p>
<p>"Shi'er, the stars in the sky that do not move are called fixed stars, and the stars that revolve around the fixed stars are called planets, and the stars that revolve around the planets are called satellites. The sun is one of the fixed stars, so it does not move. The earth is one of the planets and revolves around the sun, and it rotates from west to east, endlessly, so we see the sun rising from the east and sinking into the west every day. The earth does rotate. However, we humans and everything else will definitely not fall down, because there is a very strong attraction inside the earth, which is called gravity, which attracts humans and everything else, but humans can still move freely."</p>
<p>Shi'er was very grateful for his brother's words, because his brother had given him a new kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>— Sha Yi</p>
<p>Winter took away his son—snow, and the goddess of spring, with both hands outstretched, began to descend to the world. My clever children! Do you already have plans for spring?</p>
<p>You must know that spring is the most beautiful season, so don't miss it. You must fully appreciate it. Children! If you haven't made any plans yet, choose from the following:</p>
<p>(1) Travel Collect a large number of friends, each contributing some travel expenses (including meal expenses), and have one or two older people lead the way, and walk to a nearby town.</p>
<p>(2) Go to the countryside If you can't carry out the first item, then you can only invite three or five children to take a walk in the countryside. It is best to bring some bread and canned food, and eat around the ground in the suburbs, which is even more interesting.</p>
<p>(3) Parks If you are too far away from the countryside, you can go to several large parks. Good parks are no less tranquil and beautiful than the countryside. The benefits of a spring outing are about three kinds:</p>
<p>(1) Can increase knowledge</p>
<p>(2) Can increase literary inspiration</p>
<p>(3) Can regulate the spirit</p>
<p>(4) Children! Don't let the great spring escape!</p>

<p>According to a box of matches, "With a 'scratch' sound, the black spot is rubbed off on either side of the box, bursting out red light, dissipating our vitality, and gently falling to the ground. This is the final end of each of our compatriots. We are gladly willing to have such a fate."</p>
<p>What's strange is why a box of matches on the desk in the drawing-room would want to resist fate.</p>
<p>They also have a reason: "We are unwilling to be assigned by the master to burn cigarettes when smoking. This work cannot give the humans we love any benefit." As luck would have it, a mouse overturned a bottle of water at night, and the water splashed on them.</p>
<p>The next day, the master threw the box of matches out the door. Coincidentally, a child who collected old goods picked it up. The child put the box of matches on the stove to dry, restoring their lost abilities. From then on, the child cherished and assigned each match to do things when brewing tea and cooking rice.</p>
<p>Each match smiled contentedly: "Resisting fate, we have exhausted our greatest use."</p>

<p>— Ruo Xu</p>
<p>Zhang'er and his father went out on a tram to buy things. When the tram started, almost everyone in the car fell backward. Later, when the tram stopped, the passengers almost fell forward again, as if they couldn't stand firm. Zhang'er was very strange and couldn't figure out the reason. Later, his father told him, "This is a problem of nature. Every object has a special property, and this property is called inertia, or laziness, which is 'if an object is moving, then it always likes to continue moving non-stop, and if it is not moving, then it is always still, unless there is another force to make trouble with it.' This property was discovered by Newton, a great scholar in England."</p>
<p>Zhang'er, hearing his father's words, unknowingly solved a doubt in his heart. Finally, his father told him again, "This phenomenon of inertia is originally very common, but because Newton can often pay attention to various common things in the world, he can become a famous scholar."</p>

<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>Children! Do you brush your teeth every day?</p>
<p>Children! You can now take a mirror and look at your teeth. Are your teeth white? Is there any tartar left? Are there any cavities? You have to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Don't neglect your little teeth! They are very important for hygiene. If your teeth are not clean, they can destroy your teeth. Maybe they will then bring food into your body and destroy your stomach.</p>
<p>So, children, if you usually don't pay attention to your teeth, from now on, you have to start paying attention. Ask your dad or mom to buy a toothbrush and a bottle of toothpaste or tooth powder. The bristles on the toothbrush should be softer. You should brush once every night, morning, and after eating, so that food does not remain in your teeth and rot. After this becomes a habit, it will definitely be of great help to your health.</p>

<p>Ling'er's father: "Mosquitoes are really annoying. They suck our blood and buzz incessantly, making it impossible for us to sleep peacefully. Not only that, but sometimes they can also spread diseases! Ling'er," Dad asked with a smile, "Do you have any good ideas?"</p>
<p>Ling'er thought for a while and said, "Dad, I have an idea. Wine is such a fragrant thing! Now we immediately sprinkle some of it on the floor upstairs, so the mosquitoes will smell the fragrance and fly all the way upstairs, right? When they are all upstairs, we immediately take down the ladder, so they can't come down, right? Then we can sleep peacefully downstairs."</p>

<p>My family recently bought a parrot. It is very smart, so it has learned almost everything we usually say.</p>
<p>One day, when I was writing in the study, I suddenly heard the parrot shouting outside: "The cat is coming. The cat is coming. The cat is going to catch my tail feathers, what am I going to do!" I quickly ran outside to take a look. There was no cat there at all. It turned out that the parrot was joking.</p>
<p>Today I was in the study. I heard the parrot shouting outside again: "The cat is coming. The cat is coming. The cat is going to catch my tail feathers, what am I going to do!" I thought to myself: "Could it be that the parrot is joking with me again?" So I didn't go out to look. After a while, I walked outside. I saw that the parrot was really bitten to death on the ground by a cat!</p>

<p>Spring is here</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>The change of climate, the change of nature, in the city, one only feels the transition of "hot and cold," but in our countryside, it is unreserved. It changes at any time, and it shows us evidence at any time. The winter that has just passed not long ago, what it showed was a world of ice and snow, the trees took off their coats and hung silver fruit; the earth was desolate, bleak, and rigid. Now the season is "spring," but what evidence does it give us in the countryside?</p>
<p>Spring is here, here! We welcome it! But why is it so late? Spring! Don't you know? How many poor insects are left under the tyranny of "winter"! Children! The past winter is enough to be cursed and abandoned; this "spring" that drives away winter is worthy of our enthusiastic compliments and welcomes; however, what is spring?</p>
<p>The arrival of spring in our countryside does not require precise calculations by astronomical schools. Its arrival has its own hints for us. The morning frost, which is like white powder, has already rotted away, and instead there are bright, glistening beads. The wind, which blows coldly into the bones, has also subsided its power, and only gently and softly kisses people. Everything on the earth is preparing to move and be active in this world. There is a vigorous momentum here, and there will be many changes in the near future! Friends, I will report the news of spring later. I hereby make a reservation.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Back Wave <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>There are two ancient sayings that are as solid as gold and stone: "The back wave of the Yangtze River pushes the front wave, and new people in the world replace old people." This not only fully describes the rolling eastward flow of the Yangtze River and the ever-changing nature of human affairs and history, but even the single words "push" and "replace" are enough to show that the Yangtze River is "alive" and the world is also "alive."</p>
<p>Standing before the midnight of "March 18th," quietly reviewing the national liberation movement of the past few decades, especially the women's liberation movement, let's take a pen and draw an arc according to the degree of the movement. From the 20s of the Guangxu era, there was the enlightening natural foot movement, women's school movement, and the participation of Ms. Qiu Jin and others in the movement to overthrow the Manchu Qing dynasty. By the Xinhai year, there were women's northern expedition teams and women's military corps. After the establishment of the provisional government, although the women's army was disbanded, there was then the women's suffrage movement led by Tang Qunying and others. On March 19th of the first year of the Republic, because the Senate did not pass the women's suffrage bill, on the 20th there was a major disturbance in which women destroyed the Senate and kicked police officers. Since then, the women's movement of "imitating men" has gradually changed. Before long, the Chinese land came to a glacial era of Yuan Shikai. During this period, the world was not active, but just still. Not long after, waves arose on the calm water, colliding and stimulating each other, becoming a fierce new culture movement, with a sense of "Looking far ahead, a line of tide comes, pointing and looking back, snow forms into piles." At this time, the women's movement further put forward the slogans of "Destroying chastity! Destroying the old ethics!" Needless to say, in the national liberation movement during this period, such as in 1919 and 1926, women rationally demonstrated their strength. Women had already regarded themselves as social figures. During the Northern Expedition of 1926 and 1927, it can be said that without women, much of the effect would have been lost. The May 30th Massacre, the Shameen Massacre, and the "March 18th" resistance of all sectors of Beijing against the free navigation of the Eight-Nation Alliance on the Guhe River, each time many women were sacrificed. This period was the most intense period of the women's liberation movement, and also the most intense period of the national liberation movement. From this, we can see the complementary relationship between the two. From the 20s of the Guangxu era to the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, the women's movement rose higher and higher, and each generation was stronger than the previous one. At this time, the person holding the pen to draw the arc could simply throw down the pen and shout "Wonderful!"</p>
<p>However, the times for the women's movement are uneven, and now it happens to coincide with our incompetent generation, watching it decline and decline until it becomes still. Unable to continue the past, unable to usher in the future, what else can be said?</p>
<p>However, temporary phenomena will eventually overcome the permanent law of nature... equality and liberation are ultimately prescribed by the law of nature. In order to avenge the mournful cries of those abused maids, those devastated prostitutes, those tormented female workers, and other unfortunate women, we, the incompetent contemporary women, can only comfort them with shame and indignation, saying, "There is still a great back wave!"</p>
<h3 id="e223">New Life Movement and Modern Women <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>China is a country where everything develops abnormally. Just taking daily life as an example, some people live in extreme luxury and enjoy themselves to the fullest. From birds and beasts to reptiles and snakes, they savor every delicacy and rare ingredient, earning themselves the reputation of being gourmets, known both domestically and abroad. They adorn themselves with fox fur, embroidered silk, and enjoy electric fans in their homes, unafraid of the harshness of nature, living as if in a perpetual spring breeze, in painted pavilions and carved buildings, high towers and grand mansions. They consume goods as if they were living in the 20th century, regardless of the fact that production levels are only at the 11th or 12th century level. On the other hand, most people lack adequate clothing and food. Some have no clothes to wear or food to eat. Thatched huts and the corners of pavilions and temples are their ideal residences. As for transportation, they are fortunate to have been given natural automobiles by their mothers, allowing them to travel freely, except on water or in the air. These are already common phenomena, so I don't need to elaborate further. As for solutions, there is the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is the New Life Movement, which I am reminded of by the above-mentioned lifestyles. Of course, every citizen of the Republic of China, regardless of gender or age, should abide by the New Life Movement. However, everything has its creators, practitioners, and those who follow their example. There is an ancient folk song that goes: "In the city, high buns are favored, so everywhere they are a foot high; in the city, large sleeves are favored, so everywhere a whole bolt of silk is used; in the city, wide eyebrows are favored, so everywhere they are shaved to half the forehead." This vividly depicts the phenomenon of those above influencing those below. Since the modern ladies and misses in the cities are able to follow the footsteps of Western women in every way, with their spirit of courageously improving and skillfully imitating, I believe that the modern class should be the vanguard in the beginning of this New Life Movement.</p>
<p>The goal of the New Life Movement is to make daily life and morality conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Originally, "only when clothed and fed, do people know propriety and righteousness," but customs have changed since ancient times. Those who are clothed and fed have forgotten the ancient teachings of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." To revive the nation, we should have something like the Blue Eagle movement in the United States, where everyone wears this badge and every item is marked with this symbol. However, ordinary village girls and rural women, though living in barren lands where clothing and food are scarce, may not necessarily violate ancient teachings. Their lives, though not up to par in terms of neatness and cleanliness, are already as simple and plain as possible. Before mankind invents eating air to satisfy hunger and wearing air to keep warm, there is no way to be any simpler or plainer. Therefore, I believe that the New Life Movement should especially be initiated by the modern ladies and misses who live leisurely lives. At that time, I can change the ancient folk song to: "In the city, frugality is favored, so everywhere people eat grass and fodder; in the city, plain clothes are favored, so everywhere people wear straw mats; in the city, makeup is discarded, so everywhere people remain yellow and black." In this way, with those above influencing those below, promoting the style of cleanliness and simplicity, and concurrently implementing other militarized and rationalized practices, it will truly be like what Chairman Chiang said, "At that time, whether it is to abolish all unequal treaties or to avenge our grievances and revive our nation, it will not be difficult."</p>
<p>Modern ladies and misses have the responsibility to lead women everywhere, because village girls and rural women, once they have your leisurely lives, will follow your lead, and perhaps even surpass you. At a time when there are few producers and many consumers, and you all abide by the ancient teachings, adhere to the maxim that men manage external affairs and women manage internal affairs, and comfortably reside among those who consume, judging from the general phenomenon, among the ranks of scholar-officials, comprador generals, and young masters, there is often one person supporting several families, new ones, old ones, official ones, unofficial ones, those without a name but with the reality of it. Among those being supported, except for a few of the old ones, everyone is qualified to be in the modern class, and the material enjoyment of the modern class is truly deserving of the name. On this day of shouting "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, revive the nation," I have high hopes for the modern class.</p>
<h3 id="e224">What Love Gave Me <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Linlin</p>
<p>Here is a bit of my life experience, which I write down to offer as a lesson to my young, unmarried female compatriots.</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago, I was a believer in the theory of "sacred love"; and believed that love was the most precious treasure in life, the only consolation; it could give people the greatest strength and courage to accomplish their great careers; it could also uplift depressed youth. So, before I could finish my studies, I married my current husband—my lover.</p>
<p>But, what was the situation after marriage? What did love give me? My husband did love me, and he planned my life very well, very stably. I got money from him, the so-called household expenses. Every day I was managing the cleanliness and beauty of our bedroom, the work of the kitchen, and the care of the children. Life after marriage was limited to these things. All the ideals before marriage, the desire for knowledge, were completely shattered. I was completely detached from society. The friends, relatives, neighbors, etc., I knew, they all used my husband's name to talk to me, they all interacted with me based on my husband's relationship. I understood very well that this was the title of appendage that I had created for myself, and put around my own neck. Because for that Ms. —, others did not treat her as an appendage of her husband, and interact with her. It was because she worked in a certain organization, because she had knowledge, because she had a specialty to directly participate in social undertakings! I have now become a cripple in knowledge and skills, and should be a domestic slave, an appendage of my husband, a parasite of society.</p>
<p>Now my husband is unemployed, and life is getting tighter day by day. Although we have saved money in every way, it is of no help. The family presents a gloomy picture, and the future is very bleak. My husband is frowning all day long. I try my best to comfort him, but that only adds more anxiety to him. Later, I also realized that this kind of comfort is not what he needs. He needs someone who can help him live and solve the pain of unemployment. But, but, I have become a cripple in knowledge, a cripple in skills, how can I solve it for him?</p>
<p>I now realize that love is not the only career in life, and love cannot be the guarantee of our lifelong life. It is only a small part of people's lives. Moreover, a woman should enrich her knowledge and complete her own specialized skills for earning a living before talking about love with a man, so that she can directly participate in all social production undertakings. Then you can avoid being an appendage of your future husband, a parasite of society, and you can also help your husband solve the difficulties, misfortunes, and unexpected encounters in the family. Your family will always be happy and blissful. You personally are independent and sound in society.</p>
<h3 id="e225">The New Female Type in Modern Literature <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>Modern intellectual women seem to have a beautiful longing... "to be a new person."</p>
<p>Saying "beautiful" actually has no satirical meaning at all. Under the current social system, the privilege of education seems to only remain among women of the petty bourgeoisie or above. Their only characteristic is that they like to build their world in the imagination of the future; and the ugly face of reality is inevitably hated.</p>
<p>So, in the beautiful world of imagination, they began to create a typical statue of the new woman.</p>
<p>The American writer Sinclair Lewis wrote a novel last year called "Ann Vickers." The bookstore advertisements prominently stated that this was Lewis's first novel with a female protagonist. Here, he wrote about American women in the ten years or so before and after the Great War. At that time, American intellectual women still had a very strong individualistic atmosphere. They loved freedom, loved activities, loved careers, and the so-called "social worker" was the most popular term at the time. Under the same social system, they built the same new female type... educated, dissatisfied with the current social system, full of transformative power, and full of emotion, they all wanted to be celebrities in society, hold the power of great careers in their hands, and be a modern savior in the ugly real world. They shouted to the public in a compassionate tone...</p>
<p>"Are you suffering? Don't shout, watch me fix it for you!"</p>
<p>But the public will not answer them for this kind of person, because they always only played the role of a god, a savior; they put their own position above the public.</p>
<p>Sinclair's observations may be correct. It is said that since this "Ann Vickers" was published, the sales have not been bad, and it has been loved by many intellectual women. What is especially moving is that at the end, the author still did not forget to put his Ann Vickers, who represented the American new woman of the early 20th century, into the circle of love.</p>
<p>In the works of the new American writer John Dos Passos, "Forty-Second Parallel" and "Nineteen Nineteen", we can also find the same type of new women.</p>
<p>And in fact, this represents all new women belonging to the intellectual class. This "new woman", in the pursuit of all careers, she always only played the role of a pitiful god - we can easily see the position of the god in the current society.</p>
<p>If we want to say it without mercy, modern women, no matter which group they belong to, have not achieved much success on the economic and social status battle lines. It is necessary to further study under the constraints of the family, the exercise of husband's power, and other bad social systems. From Gladkov's novel "Cement", we can see the outline of the new woman formed from the melting pot... the husband who left home for three years to participate in the war did not recognize the young wife at all when he returned. She could no longer endure the order to "come to bed!", and was no longer a virtuous housekeeper.</p>
<p>"There's hard bread and coffee, get it yourself, I still have a lot to do tomorrow," the wife said to her husband, who had been away for three years.</p>
<p>"What the hell have you seen?"</p>
<p>This is really a magical magic, three years of time, turning a young woman into this appearance.</p>
<p>But precisely because this is the training obtained from human society, and this training may be necessary for modern new women.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't want to define a model for the new woman, that is fundamentally boring; but modern new women should be liberated from housework, and strive to obtain equal status with men in economic, cultural, and other conditions, and equally do something more meaningful, it seems necessary, right?</p>
<p>World Famous Women</p>
<h3 id="e226">Mrs. Ninnepeng, Danish Minister of Education <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xuewen</p>
<p>The general public's view of the two sexes cannot get rid of the following prejudice: that women and men have various differences in ability. When women handle something, they rarely have their own opinions, and blindly follow others, "repeating what others say," and are "irresolute" in doing things, etc. However, looking at Mrs. Ninnepeng's handling methods, we can now know that this is not right.</p>
<p>She is Danish and has served as the Minister of Education in Denmark. When she took office, a reporter from an American magazine criticized her like this... "She is female and radical!" We can know what kind of person she is from this criticism.</p>
<p>Two things people dare not do...</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, she did two things that people did not dare to do.</p>
<p>The first thing was to dismiss the directors of the Royal Theater. In Denmark, there was originally a great national art institution called the Royal Theater. Inside, there were many famous works from ancient and modern times, as well as a large group of theater troupes and dance teams. It had a very long history and reputation in the country. However, according to the inherited regulations, the four directors of this theater had to call someone with the title of count to be the director. However, each count could not concentrate on the duties of the theater, and the other directors took this opportunity to muddle through. As a result, the inside of the theater became extremely corrupt, even having its form but only embracing the false name of history. When Mrs. Ninnepeng took office, she greatly disagreed with this situation. As a result, she dismissed the count and the directors who were not working effectively, and only retained one director who was competent, and ordered him to concentrate on running it, so the theater was rectified.</p>
<p>As for that poor count, she simply said he was "useless dust."</p>
<p>The second thing was to ban the interference of the parish in schools. In Denmark, the power of the church originally spread everywhere, and the pastors of each parish had the special right to inspect schools. If the school did not teach religious subjects effectively, it would be punished by the parish. As a result, every lively child's mind was made dull by religious subjects. After Mrs. Ninnepeng took office, she again greatly disagreed with this, and on the one hand, she vigorously supported the teachers' union to oppose the church's inspection; on the other hand, she ordered the director of the teachers' training institute to be dismissed. In this way, the inherited power of the parish over the school was invisibly eliminated.</p>
<p>These two things were things that previous Danish Ministers of Education dared not do, but she actually implemented them according to her own views.</p>
<p>Her biography...</p>
<p>Mrs. Ninnepeng has done many other things. She was born in 1866 and joined the Social Democratic Party early on. She obtained a master's degree from a famous university in Copenhagen. In 1903, she served as the clerk of the Social Democratic Party headquarters. In 1917, she worked for the Copenhagen Bureau of Industry. In 1918, she became a member of the Upper House. She has many writings, about history and economics. Her husband is a doctor of philosophy and is also enthusiastic about the social democratic movement.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Overview of Women's Lives in Gaiping County, Liaoning <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhibai</p>
<p>—A glimpse of women's lives in the interior of our country—</p>
<p>Gaiping County, Liaoning, is a place where Han, Manchu, and Hui people live together. The Han people account for about two-thirds, the Manchu people are fewer, and the Hui people are the least. Therefore, customs and habits are gradually assimilated by the Han people. Moreover, they intermarry, and the inherent customs become mixed. The situation of women of all ethnic groups rarely shows inherent and different traces. Now, I will briefly write a systematic narrative of the women's lives in this area, to offer to those who love to know the customs and human feelings of various places.</p>
<p>(1) Family</p>
<p>Women in Gaiping County, Liaoning, have the following responsibilities in the family: to be filial and obedient to elders, to be tolerant and respectful to peers, and to nurture and teach younger generations. Their minds are full of good ideas such as "virtuous daughter-in-law," "virtuous lady," and "virtuous wife and loving mother." They are bound by the old chains—the three obediences and four virtues, and the husband sings, the wife follows. They must listen to the commands and teachings of their husbands in everything. In the family, they are in a position to be directed, and they do not get some rights. But they do not argue. The idea of "equal rights for men and women" has never entered their minds.</p>
<p>(2) Knowledge</p>
<p>Because education is not popular, there are only a few simple female teachers, higher primary schools, and lower primary schools in Gaiping County. Male schools do not recruit female students, and female schools do not recruit male students. There are no female schools in the countryside. People all uphold the old morality that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue," and the poor are even more unable to afford to go to school, so women who have received education are like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The general women are uneducated, vulgar, and do not understand worldly affairs. Their minds are filled with stories from Biographies of Heroic Women, Collections of Famous Sages, and Women's Moral Classics. New knowledge will not invade their minds.</p>
<p>(3) Clothing and Decoration</p>
<p>Most Han women wear short clothes, and a small number still bind their feet—although foot binding has been banned, many people still bind their feet—most Manchu and Hui women wear cheongsams and have natural feet. Han women comb their hair in a bun style, while Manchu and Hui women comb their hair in a large bouffant style. These still preserve obvious traces of ethnicity. As for women who cut their hair, they are rarely seen in Gaiping County. They wear flowers on their heads, apply powder to their faces, lipstick to their lips, and wear embroidered shoes on their feet. With such decorations, their hearts are filled with infinite beauty, they linger in front of the mirror, as if they were celestial beings, and their faces show an arrogant look. They also show off to others and can also please others.</p>
<p>(4) Frugality and Hard Work</p>
<p>The women of Gaiping County are very simple and frugal with money. They wear cloth clothes and cloth shoes and walk on foot. They have the virtue of frugality. In the spring, they sow seeds on the ground like men. In the summer, under the hot sun, they hoe the ground like men. In the autumn, they go to the fields and the threshing floor, working desperately. In the winter, because there is nothing to do in the fields, they are still constantly engaged in needlework, spinning hemp ropes, etc., at home. Their hard work is no less than that of men, and this spirit is truly admirable.</p>
<p>(5) Occupation</p>
<p>Gaiping County is mainly agricultural, and most women work at home. Because it is easy to live and they are bound by old morals, women cannot go out to work. Only when they are extremely poor and have no choice do they become female workers. Women can make hemp ropes, spin thread, spin cattle hair, and do needlework in their spare time at home, which can earn them a few silver coins, which is commonly called making up for "the expenses of shoes, heads, and feet." This can be considered their extra occupation—or their side business.</p>
<p>(6) Customs Sketch</p>
<p>As a rule, throughout the entire first month of the year, women stop working and avoid moving needles and threads. They come up with all sorts of strange ways to pass the time. Like inviting the Kitchen God Aunt, using the method of kowtowing to predict the good or bad of the year. On the seventh day of the first month, women have to eat radishes—said to be able to prevent toothache for a year. On the night of the fifteenth day of the first month, they all go ice skating, which can prevent leg pain for a year. There are too many of these ridiculous superstitious things. They most believe in fortune-telling blind men. In a month, they often want to have their fortunes told. They are not stingy with this kind of expense. Women cannot visit their parents' home after the twenty-second day of the twelfth month—for fear of harming their parents' family. Before the sixth day of the first month, women cannot look at the offerings and cured meat on the ancestors' altar in their parents' home—looking at it is detrimental to their parents' family—if women sew clothes on their bodies (without taking off their clothes), they must hold a pipe in their mouths—for fear of others accusing them of being thieves. This is just a glimpse of the customs of women in Gaiping County. The above six sections are the outline of women's lives in Gaiping County.</p>

<p>4. Selection of a Spouse</p>
<p>—Whether the other party has a venereal disease—</p>
<p>Of course, there are many conditions for choosing a spouse, such as the other party's personality, knowledge, economic ability, and health status. These should all be carefully considered. Now, I will only discuss the health aspect... From the perspective of heredity and eugenics, people with tuberculosis, leprosy, and venereal diseases should absolutely avoid marrying. Among them, venereal disease is the most terrible... Therefore, when choosing a spouse, the first condition should be to be absolutely free from venereal disease. There are many women in the world who silently lead unhappy and painful lives because their husbands have venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Because of the difference in physiological organization between men and women, men tend to be dynamic and cannot easily live a life of abstinence. However, under the current social system, because it is not easy to make a living, men are often unable to marry or marry late. As a result, the risk rate of venereal diseases also increases. Examining the treatment of venereal diseases, it is very difficult. It takes a considerable amount of time and money to be completely cured, and once the treatment is interrupted, there is a risk that it cannot be eradicated. If a woman marries such a man, what will her pain be like? Therefore, before marriage, a reliable doctor should be asked to issue a health certificate, which should be exchanged with each other. This is a necessary procedure to be followed before marriage. If a couple in love is approaching the wedding date, and the man knows that he has a venereal disease, he should inform the woman before marriage, and then remarry only after the doctor proves that he has been completely cured.</p>
<p>Last year, a so-called marriage cancellation issue occurred in Japan. The fact is that there was a couple in love who, with the agreement of both parents, chose a date to marry. After a solemn and lively wedding ceremony, the woman discovered on the wedding night that the man had a venereal disease. She immediately announced it to both families and proposed to cancel the marriage contract. At that time, the guests had not yet dispersed and were shocked to hear the news. However, the woman abruptly and resolutely said that it must be canceled immediately. In the end, the marriage contract was canceled in public, and she returned to her mother's home with her pure heart and body. This news spread throughout Japan last year, and the general public opinion believed that it was a rational new woman's unyielding and proper means, and a blow to irresponsible men.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Financial News: Gold Price Drops 5.5 Yuan <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>American Bank Representative to Present Opinion on Monday</p>
<p>After the previous day's sharp rise in the gold market, the American Bank failed to offer lower prices yesterday, and instead prices rebounded. While this was expected, the upward trend was inevitably halted. The exchange market eased, and retail investors took the opportunity to sell small amounts, leading to a decline. The fluctuation range during the morning session was narrow. At the opening, due to the unified decline in the British and American silver markets, the closing price of forward silver on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 3 to 5 percent. Exchange rates slightly contracted. London spot gold rose by one penny, American cotton fell by sixteen pounds, while American wheat rose by three and seventy-five hundredths. Although the opening price of wool showed a slight decline, the overall situation remained stable. Later, Reuters reported that although the U.S. Treasury Secretary stated that silver legislation was not currently needed and that supporters of silver were pursuing private interests, Senator Rayner would present his opinion on Monday. Rayner is one of the most ardent supporters of the silver faction, and he stated that they were attempting to implement silver policies. The market opened lower, and after the opening, banks actively bid. The domestic market was weak and further declined. After entering, although there was a slight struggle, the exchange market remained loose, and the market situation continued to weaken. March futures rebounded due to successful buying by the Dalian group, and the swap spread gradually stabilized. The price of refined gold was 969 yuan. The morning market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 956.2 yuan, a decrease of 2.7 yuan compared to the previous close. The price of goods opened at 6.3 yuan. The morning opening price for recent sales in the exchange market was 1 shilling, 4 and 3125/10000 pence for British currency and 34.625 yuan for U.S. currency. Mitsubishi and Wubishi bid 125/10000 for July U.S. dollars. Hengxing, Qianchangxiang sold, and the price retreated from 6.3 yuan to 4.8 yuan. It was predicted that HSBC would list British currency at par and U.S. currency would decrease by 125/10000. Zhifeng Yonglai bought, returning to 5.7 yuan. Zhejiang bid 0.0625 for June U.S. dollars, and Wubishi bid 0.1875 for July U.S. dollars. The domestic market remained strong. Hengxing, Yida Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Zhengchang, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng and others jointly sold bars. Wubishi offered 0.125 for June U.S. dollars, causing the price to fall to 3.5 yuan. After entering, Mitsui and Zhengjin bought 0.125 for June U.S. dollars, and the exchange market slightly stabilized. Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong and others took advantage of the low price to buy, and the price rose to 4.8 yuan. Zhifeng Yong suddenly came to sell, and the price still declined, but because Yicheng, Yifeng Yong, and Hongli slightly absorbed, there was more struggle. After hovering, the domestic market remained strong. Although banks bought 0.25 for July U.S. dollars, it suddenly became difficult to sell again. Although Hengxing bought, due to retail investors vigorously selling small amounts, Yicheng, Qianchangxiang, Zhengchang, Dachangxiang and others jointly supplied bars, and the price fell to 3.2 yuan. Mitsui and Wubishi bought 0.3125 for July U.S. dollars. The noon close was 953.4 yuan, and the price of goods was 3.8 yuan. After the market closed, Reuters reported that American automobile workers had not yet gone on strike, granting the government a four-day grace period, and the market situation slightly stabilized. The highest price during the morning was 956.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 953.2 yuan, a difference of 3.1 yuan, with a range of 5.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 1014 yuan, due to HSBC bank reducing the listing price of U.S. currency by 0.0125, to 34.125 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 60 yuan lower, a decrease of 9 yuan compared to the previous close.

<p>Short Position Swap Relationship</p>
<p>The Bond Market Shows Signs of Rising</p>
<p>—New High Prices Continue to Be Discovered—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw the market continue to trend upward, with a shift in sentiment and increased confidence. The core reason for the rise was still the short position swap relationship. With a slight difference between the supply and demand of chips, the trend began to fluctuate. The longer the market hovered and brewed, the greater the reaction. Initially, the environmental situation was irrelevant. After the previous day's rise in market prices, the short positions showed no ability to resist. Therefore, floating short positions continued to be covered, and the market price gradually rose as they mutually raised prices, with new high prices continuing to be discovered. At current market prices, the general price is around 62%, and it is not impossible to rise to 65%. The surface situation is still extremely firm, with signs of climbing step by step. In terms of the overall trend, treasury bonds are centered on salt tax, and public bonds should promote gold short. Due to the excessive reduction in military spending, speculative nature is gradually disappearing, and it will be difficult to escape this fate in the future. Transactions in the 22nd year of customs duties have gradually increased and also occupied a considerable position. The overall trend for the day was still a steady and gradual rise, with most transactions being swaps. Numbers 5 and 53 were in greater demand, and retail investors mostly covered short positions. In the morning, both sessions rose by one or two jiao per session, and the afternoon opening continued to be good by one or two jiao, with the 20th and recent salt tax slightly lower by 0.05, due to different swap positions. The close was flat, while the salt tax gold short was extremely stable. The newly established high prices for Number 19 military reorganization, Number 20 roll, Number 20 customs, and unified salt have all been discovered. As a result, market prices continued to rise by 0.1 to 0.35, but long-term military reorganization rose by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day because it had not been traded for two or three days. The total number of transactions was 10,088,700 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods. The total spot goods was 10,088,500 yuan.

<p>Standard Flour Quiet and Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, prices for all months generally remained stable.  With foreign wheat quoted, Chicago and Canada both rebounded by about 1.5 jiao, so after the opening, people's minds were already settled, but trading was exceptionally slow.  The North Road merchants were completely inactive. Even the merchants from the ports of the Northeast Three Provinces, although the rivers have already thawed, had no transactions.  The sluggishness of actual sales was far beyond the expectations of the factories.  By the afternoon opening, because the major factories were still mutually holding firm, although trading was slow, prices were still being held high. However, merchants from all routes were suffering hardships and had no purchasing power, so the market was relatively good, but transactions were still very few.  As a result, the current month was better by 7.5 li, April was better by 1.25 fen, May was better by 1 fen, June was better by 5 li, July was better by 1 fen, and August was better by 7.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Wheat Futures Quiet and Unremarkable <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the morning and afternoon openings, all months remained stagnant and quiet. Foreign wheat quotes, Chicago and Canada, rebounded by about 1.5 jiao, but for buying and selling across all months, both local and outside parties were watching. The current month opened with a price of 4 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen, which was better by 3 fen compared to the previous day. However, the bullish momentum for raising prices was greatly reduced. Only July saw some transactions, with the price being better by 2 fen, but it was still very dull. The current wheat market is already weaker, because the standard is at par, and customers dare not raise it further. Yingzhou wheat opened at 3 yuan and 5 jiao, Bengbu wheat at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen, and Suqian wheat at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, totaling 2,000 bags, which were handled by Fufeng and Huafeng, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Hakka Xian and Fujian Merchants Handle with Special Enthusiasm <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Hakka Xian rice market saw Hakka demand even stronger, with local merchants also responding. The entire city traded 16,279 bags, the largest transaction volume seen this year. The most active destinations were the Quanzhou and Fuzhou merchants from Fujian Province, totaling over 12,000 bags. Second were the Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants from Zhejiang Province, also taking over 2,000 bags. Local merchants also handled 2,000 bags. Xiang rice accounted for more than half of the goods, followed by Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, with 1,500 bags. Nanjing, Shashi, Wuxi factory xian, etc., ranged from several hundred to over a thousand bags each. Even Japanese merchants were handling actively, especially the Fujian merchants who were the most eager. Market sentiment has generally turned upward. Furthermore, local stockpiling in Hunan has caused production prices to rise, and market conditions are rising daily. Yesterday, due to the activity of Fujian and Zhejiang merchants, brown rice, etc., rose by another 1 jiao, and medium-grade machine-milled xian rose by 5 to 6 fen. Although the Fujian and Zhejiang merchants have continuously handled large quantities in recent days, their subsequent demand seems to continue to be strong, so various stalls selling machine-milled brown Hakka Xian are still looking forward to further improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Late Rice Sales Sluggish, Retreating by Five Fen <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Fu) Yesterday's source of goods from various merchants was similar to before, totaling twenty-four or five boats of late rice (over 3,000 piculs), and twelve or three boats of thick japonica rice (over 2,000 piculs). The purchasing appetite of merchants for late rice suddenly turned weak, and the merchants all stood by and watched. It was not until near noon that the Nanyang merchants began to take about 1,000 bags. At this time, the Beiyang merchants followed suit, but the quantity was ultimately very small, presumably due to the weekend shipping schedule. Consequently, the prices of Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, Lintang, and other goods saw a decline of 5 fen. As for the various thick japonica rice varieties, although the demand from urban and rural shops continued to weaken, the appetite seemed to be satisfied, so they were extremely strict on the issue of purchasing. Therefore, although the prices of Changshu, Suzhou, Tongzhou, Nangang, and other japonica rice varieties did not rise or fall, the market situation already showed a clear stagnation and hidden weakness. Du Yangjian's arrivals and sales were balanced, also showing a stable situation. Yinbian Yuan's sales slightly improved, and the market looked promising.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, thirty-two or three boats arrived from various merchants downstream. The sales appetite of various goods in the market turned dull, and the market price of white japonica rice was stable. Early rice and thin rice prices were cut by several fen. Yangjian was also flat and weak. Du Bu, Ke Jian, and Bian Yin Yuan saw no significant changes.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Peanut Market Turns Active <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The peanut market had been sluggish for a long time. Yesterday, the market atmosphere began to turn active. This was because foreign firms in Qingdao moved to increase prices, so the Guangdong market also improved. Local purchasing demand increased sharply, and the city's total transaction volume was about 400 tons. The selling price of Xuzhou goods was 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen to 7 jiao. Guide goods opened at 3 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen to 8 jiao. Lanfeng goods were quoted at 4 yuan, and Kaifeng goods were at 4 yuan and 1 jiao. Peanut sales have declined recently, so market prices continue to weaken, it is said.</p>

<p>New Stock of English Tinplate Arrives</p>
<p>The long-awaited 90-pound English tinplate, its new stock of over 2,000 boxes, arrived at the Xin Tai Gu Wharf yesterday. Therefore, customers who generally purchase this product rushed to buy it upon hearing the news. It is said that over 500 boxes have been sold, with a price of 15 yuan and 1 jiao per box, which is slightly less than the American product by two to three jiao. However, the exchange rate has been shrinking recently, so market conditions have not declined.</p>

<h3 id="e268">The Suicide Problem <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>All of people's efforts and struggles are for the sake of one word: "life." In our era, even those who are penniless must beg and plead for scraps to survive. As for the wealthy, they naturally want to live forever and enjoy an extremely comfortable life. Life, whether rich or poor, is something everyone truly craves.</p>
<p>Yet, strangely, there are many living people in the world who commit suicide! In recent years, the number of suicides in China has been increasing day by day. In Shanghai alone, on average, several suicide news items are published in various newspapers every week. What is the reason for this? Generally, this problem is superficially understood from the perspective of the individual suicide victim. If the suicide victim committed suicide due to a broken heart, it is said that the reason lies in the heartbreak. If the suicide victim committed suicide due to economic oppression, it is said that the reason lies in economic oppression. But the problem is not as simple as that.</p>
<p>First, we should know that among countless suicide victims, regardless of how different the direct causes of their suicides may be, regardless of how different their suicide methods may be, there is one thing they have in common: that is, their suicide is due to their feeling hopeless about everything. If a person still has a glimmer of hope, if there is still a ray of light in front of them, I dare say that they would never commit suicide no matter what.</p>
<p>Hope, although it can be said to be a kind of human instinct, is determined by the social environment in which they live. The hopes of doctors and prostitutes are different, the hopes of movie stars and tofu-selling girls are different, and the hopes of warlords, corrupt officials, and the common people clash. The reason for this is that their living environments are different. Therefore, a person's despairing suicide is actually produced by the society in which they live. Suicide due to being unable to resist economic oppression is naturally due to the fact that the society in which they live cannot provide them with relative economic satisfaction. Suicide due to feeling hopeless about the future of the country is even more inextricably linked to the society in which they live. Even young men and women who commit suicide due to heartbreak do so because they feel that everything else in the society in which they live is of no great significance, forming a concept of love as the primary meaning of life. Therefore, once they lose their love, they feel that everything is over, that the universe and life have no meaning at all, and that the only option is suicide....</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that if a country or a society has a larger number of suicides, it is all the more proof that the morbidity of this society is serious, and that it cannot satisfy the majority of people, causing many people to feel disappointed and commit suicide. In China today, not only is the number of suicides increasing day by day, but the scope of suicides is also expanding. It has now expanded from coolies, merchants, and prostitutes to poets and movie stars. The former is exemplified by the poet Zhu Xiang's drowning, and now there is the movie star Ai Xia's poisoning. These shocking facts fully illustrate how the current Chinese society is destroying the lives of many people, and how deep the root cause of the problem has become.</p>
<p>However, although the cause of suicide lies in the morbidity of society, the act of suicide is not a heroic expression. Suicides are, in reality, cowards. If the morbid society of China today produces many suicide tragedies, then the suicides of many people under this are cowardly expressions of their inability to resist the attacks of this society!</p>

<h3 id="e269">Our Writer <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Lun Liu</p>
<p>Our writer opened a major magazine's submission guidelines and looked at them excitedly.</p>
<p>"Three yuan a day! Thirty yuan for ten thousand words!"</p>
<p>So, he started taking out his pen. Writing requires ink, so our author searched for a bottle of Min Sheng brand blue ink stained with dirt at the bottom of the table. But the bottle was already empty. Our author cursed "Damn it!" and took out two dimes from his tattered suit pocket, and then ran out of his small room. Next, he ran back and picked up the thermos. He said softly, "I have to write good articles... be happy and healthy, make money... this is capital."</p>
<p>Our author came back from the public stove after getting hot water. Now, he was thinking about what kind of article to write. Unconsciously, he returned to his small room. He had ink, he had tea, but a bald head stretched in from the corner of the door. Our writer frowned, but then he realized that this head had power, it was the landlord's face demanding money, and he had no choice but to stand up. The bald head spoke first...</p>
<p>"Hey! - Two months of rent hasn't been paid. We can't live on air. Otherwise, everyone will lose face. You are a scholar..."</p>
<p>He couldn't speak. In fact, he was still planning to write 15,000 words! Send it today, receive it the day after tomorrow, maybe the editor will like me, and tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, there will be a response, so he spoke with some backbone...</p>
<p>"Today is the 7th, I will definitely pay it off by the 10th, sixteen yuan, not a single penny less!"</p>
<p>With that, the landlord started to roll out, and he closed the door.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll see you on the 10th..." The words below were not clear. Forget about it, our writer quickly wrote the article, lest he get angry!</p>
<p>Next door, a radio suddenly turned on, a three-tube machine - the sound was noisy enough. And there were several tactless women laughing wildly.</p>
<p>"...rocking...baby...want to...sleep."</p>
<p>Our writer dropped his pen, took out a cigarette, and threw away the empty pack. He also stopped thinking about what kind of novel to write and started cursing...</p>
<p>"This kind of star, hey, shameless. Still - broadcasting what sound! ..."</p>
<p>He wanted to keep cursing, but the radio next door turned up again, the sound was even more unpleasant.</p>
<p>"...My baby, my baby..."</p>
<p>Those women also made their voices shrill at the same time, it was a sound that made people's hair stand on end, and after a while, they laughed wildly again.</p>
<p>Our writer sighed, and sullenly slipped out of his small room. He slapped the table and said heavily...</p>
<p>"——Going to find material!" Temporarily, he also took a major magazine.</p>
<p>Late at night, after spending fifteen copper coins to eat a bowl of plain noodles, our writer returned to his small room. Now, he was already carrying a heavy fatigue, not caring about anything, putting it off until tomorrow, wanting to sleep was the nature of a writer. Our writer fell asleep snoring.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the calendar reads "8". Our writer washed his face with water he got from the public stove, sipped his tea, and picked up his pen. But yesterday, he "dawdled" for a long time, and couldn't find any good material for a novel to submit. If our writer could throw sixteen yuan on the table, the landlord would take it away with great importance without saying a word, how majestic that would be - in this way, our writer made a gesture with his pen on the paper he had just laid out.</p>
<p>"Now, articles must grasp modernity. Or write a novel about war!" But our writer had never seen a war. When Shanghai was fighting, our writer also escaped home to spend a year. So he wanted to use another kind of material to write an article.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Popular articles - the latest style, proletarian literature..." He also thought of describing the background of rural collapse.</p>
<p>Our writer wrote the two words "Autumn Harvest" on the first line of the manuscript paper, but he also thought that this theme was too common, so he immediately tore it to shreds. At this time, he remembered the rent again, and he only had one silver dollar on him.</p>
<p>As a result, our writer wrote an article called "Year-End". He described the suffering of a farmer, and the year-end hardships in the bankrupt countryside. Although he didn't understand how difficult the year-end was for farmers, he yawned triumphantly, and broke two pen tips. This was a capital of 14,000 words and forty yuan. It was already the 9th, and tomorrow, he had to pay off the hard words from the day before. So our writer cleverly wrote a letter to the editor, saying that he had to leave for Hangzhou the day after tomorrow, and asked for the payment to be sent immediately. He also personally went to the post office to affix the postage, double registered!</p>
<p>On the 10th, our writer opened his eyes and it was already eleven o'clock. A person was pushed into the small room, and he thought...</p>
<p>"Has the payment arrived?"</p>
<p>But——a bald head, with two energetic eyes looking at him.</p>
<p>"Ha! Let me go to my friend Mr. Li's place to get the money today..."</p>
<p>The bald head couldn't speak, he only slowly swallowed a sentence and left, this sentence was an ambiguous word containing half irony and half hope, the sound seemed to have not dissipated...</p>
<p>"See...if...you...don't...break your promise!"</p>
<p>Our writer jumped out of bed, rummaged through the boxes but found nothing to pawn, so he went out. He did not leave the vicinity of his small room, he was afraid that the person sending the payment would deliver it to the wrong address. It was not until the afternoon that he saw the postman knocking on the door, and our writer's heart was boiling. He quickly ran to the door where the postman was standing, and saw a large roll, he couldn't speak, he just shouted... "Give it to me, give it to me."</p>
<p>When our writer received his masterpiece returned intact, he was disheartened. He did not unpack the rejected manuscript. He just shouted... "....Introducing new works, deceiving people, damn it, just teasing me."</p>
<p>He had no relatives here, only a few poor friends, who also traded in submissions. Our writer was now running on a purposeless road, the bald head's ambiguous words had not yet dissipated...</p>
<p>"See...if...you...don't...break your promise!"</p>
<p>This, our writer couldn't care about, later, he didn't return to his small room.</p>

<h3 id="e270">British Military Expansion Fever <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Lin</p>
<p>According to the British aircraft industry's mouthpiece "Aircraft," all British aircraft manufacturers made substantial profits last year (1933). Fairey Aviation Co, famous for manufacturing military aircraft, increased its profits by 12.5 percent in 1933. Rolls-Royce Co, which specializes in manufacturing motors for British military aircraft, increased its profits by 5.5 percent. British aircraft production also increased last year. Hawker Engineering Co has recently set up a new company to operate this thriving business. And according to the company's boss, Mr. S. P. Cigg, the number of aircraft produced last year broke the record of the past few years after the war. The reason why the British aircraft industry can be particularly prosperous in this year of economic depression is naturally due to Britain's fervent military expansion. Last year, Britain's air force expenditure was 17,426,000 pounds, expenditure on the army was 37,950,000 pounds (an increase of 1,462,000 pounds compared to 1932), and navy expenditure was 53,370,000 pounds (an increase of 3 million pounds compared to 1932).</p>
<p>Britain has also repeatedly conducted experiments on controlling aircraft by radio. It is said that several inventions in this area have been secretly patented. The year before last, Vickers Arinsttong obtained patents for new aircraft guns, bomb-dropping and bomb-throwing machines, etc. And last year, several inventions concerning anti-aircraft guns and machine guns were also patented.</p>
<p>Recently, the British cavalry regiment was reorganized into a tank regiment, and the combat power of the original tank battalions has been strengthened. The armored vehicle regiment has also been reorganized. In short, the British army's three-year mechanization plan is progressing step by step, with new completions every year.</p>
<p>Britain is also making every effort in the preparation for chemical warfare. Under the leadership of military authorities and specially appointed chemical experts, military chemical research is underway. Among its recent achievements, the important ones are complete gas masks and a new type of poison gas. Naturally, the British government's expenditure of 105,000 pounds on this "scientific endeavor" last year will not be without a price.</p>
<p>In addition, various experiments on naval, land and air force equipment are also frequently held. Last year, Britain spent 758,000 pounds on naval experiments, 615,000 pounds on army experiments, and 1,385,000 pounds on air force experiments.</p>
<p>However, the British media still do not consider this kind of fervent arms expansion to be sufficient, and they often hysterically say that Britain's military equipment is insufficient. The Daily Mail even listed figures, pointing out that Britain ranks only fifth among the major powers in terms of air force, and advocating the immediate construction of 3,000 aircraft. Last year, the Conservative Party (the current ruling party in Britain) annual meeting also passed a resolution approving this proposal.</p>
<p>It seems that British aircraft factories will undoubtedly have a good year this year. (According to the British Esperanto News Agency)</p>

<p>— Ms. Zhu</p>
<p>This is neither a whirlpool of the turbulent times, nor a storm in history; this is a small bubble that disappears in the vast sea of people. It is not worth remembering, nor worth sighing; but it is hateful that it often comes to mind in my heart! In the year of the eighteenth century's death under the grinding wheels of history, it was a great famine year. At that time, the best white rice sold for no more than five thousand coins per dan, and dried tofu was still two small coins a piece, but the news of people starving to death was no longer anything to talk about. It was at that time that my mother fell into my father's home. Although my father was such a kind and benevolent person, and that mother who died ten years earlier! The so-called legitimate mother, was also equally gentle and amiable; but, undoubtedly, my mother lived a life of cattle, horses and slaves. Living in the old family of feudal society, my mother continued to bear the burden of household labor and life for the next thirty years. However, in people's eyes, there was no place for the mother in the so-called "human" realm. Although she could work and give birth, she was regarded as a living meat machine in the family; she could not be regarded as a member of society. Such a view has not only become the "golden rule" in the past society, but also has its explicit basis in the law today! Where can my mother obtain the qualification of a "person"? I can't help but cry out for my mother, and shout out for the thousands of oppressed women in the old society!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I only shouted this once, and I had to leave my mother again for six years.</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since I had any news of my mother. Needless to say, I could not enjoy the greatest maternal love in the world, and I could not even receive news of my mother's daily life, which could usually give me some comfort; what loss and heartache in life is greater than this? My spiritual God! Bless my mother! People all over the world who are far away from their loving mothers, let us bless the mothers of the world!</p>
<p>I remember in the harsh winter of 1931, a letter from my mother was sent from my hometown, with the following passage...</p>
<p>"...Since you left, slander has gathered on me. The clansmen disapprove of what you have done, and hate me as a result, and add insult to injury, deceiving, enticing, and threatening in many ways, trying to seize your father's inheritance. I am old and weak, and you have no brothers, and I am lonely and helpless, so it is difficult to contend with them. At this time, the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, and I have no means of livelihood, and I am destined to starve to death. I have no choice but to give up everything and leave my hometown to go to your uncle's house, to end this remaining life. Your future is bright, I hope you will not think of me as a candle in the wind, and harm your body; fortunately..."</p>
<p>At that time, when I read this letter, tears streamed down my face, and my heart was shattered, and I almost fainted; the heartache and resentment at that time were truly indescribable. I think my tears were almost exhausted for this time, so in the past two years, although I have also thought of her and my heart aches, and I have even encountered repeated difficulties and even sometimes thought of committing suicide, I have never shed a tear again.</p>
<p>I do not have a fixed address, and my uncle's house is a rural village without postal service; although there are so-called relatives and friends in my hometown, they all treat me as a rebellious enemy; in this way, my mother's news is like a lone boat sunk in the sea, making it impossible for me to explore.</p>
<p>Originally, all of my mother's hardships were bestowed by the current social system, and I should naturally not be held responsible; however, now that she is "destined to starve to death", can I say that I should not be held responsible? How heartbreaking this is! But, what can I do? I think, under this social system, if the children of countless mothers are unwilling to sell their souls and cannot exploit the blood and sweat of others, can they really "lie on ice to seek carp" or "cry bamboo to grow bamboo shoots" to show filial piety to their mothers? Even if these things are possible; their mothers would never let their children do them, right?</p>
<p>How empty and how painful is the heart of a poor person's mother!</p>
<p>When I think of my mother, I curse the old society; it not only makes millions of people starve and suffer, but also destroys the most precious love between fathers and sons and between mothers and daughters without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>"Although my hometown is good, I don't think of returning" This truly reveals my heart. In fact, not to mention that there is nothing worth cherishing in my hometown, where else in this world, except for that pure land that I yearn for, is there a place for me to stand? Here, I can't help but recall Yang Sao's poems...</p>
<p>"My heart is leisurely, I don't know where to go, I don't know where to stay?</p>
<p>While I am still young, I will do my best to wander; if I grow old, I will die!! Die in the heart of heaven and earth!"</p>

<h3 id="e272">Splashing Water on a Bottle <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— White Goose</p>
<p>This is a physics-based game, but the method is very simple and the principle is also easy to understand.</p>
<p>Method: Take a white glass bottle, fill it with a little more than half water, and place it in a pot of salt water to boil. After the water in the pot boils, and the water in the bottle boils as well, put on the stopper, remove the bottle, and place it horizontally on the table (at this time, the water is no longer boiling). Then, take a glass of cold water and splash it on the bottle, and the water inside the bottle will boil again. Splash another glass, and it will boil again in the same way.</p>
<p>Reason: Ordinarily, if the water in a bottle is placed in fresh water and boiled, the water in the bottle will not boil; after adding salt, the temperature of the salt water will be higher than one hundred degrees depending on the amount of salt, so the water in the bottle also boils. After boiling, the air inside the bottle is completely expelled by the water vapor. To prevent air from entering again, the stopper is put on. After splashing cold water, the water vapor inside the bottle condenses into water droplets, so the atmospheric pressure above the water in the bottle is reduced. Because the lower the pressure on the water surface, the lower the boiling point of the water, so even without adding more fire, the water boils again.</p>

<p>— Yang Wenzhi</p>
<p>After the First World War of 1914 and 1928, the imperialist powers re-divided the world. In Europe, it was the Treaty of the Versailles Peace Conference; in the Americas, it was the agreement of the Washington Conference. However, the situations created by these two international conferences are now outdated and no longer correspond to the balance of power between the imperialist powers. Because the law of uneven development of capitalism has shown its effect particularly powerfully after the European war. The situation of uneven development is very obviously manifested in the era of the general crisis of capitalism. And in the third period of the general crisis today—the deepening of the global economic panic—the force of uneven development has been further strengthened. The period of relative stability of capitalism has ended. Huge conflicting forces are developing as much as possible, and the current world is approaching the door of war. Re-dividing the world through war is the current problem for the imperialist powers. Now, let's try to briefly discuss the main focal points of conflict between imperialists.</p>
<p>European Problems: The temporary victory of Fascist Germany has further promoted the crisis of armed conflict. The fuse of war has already been lit. Fascist Germany demands revision of the Treaty of Versailles. It demands the return of Danzig (the Polish Corridor) and the Saar. This corridor issue could trigger an outbreak of war at any time, because France (the de facto master of Poland) will not easily allow Germany to gain a new and economically important seaport in Western Europe.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Austrian problem is also one of the most important issues in revising the Treaty of Versailles. Fascist Germany openly demands the "annexation of Austria." Because if Austria and Germany merge, German imperialism can reach out to seize the sphere of influence in the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East, such as Turkey, and surround Czechoslovakia on three sides, and raise the issue of incorporating the three million Germans in Czechoslovakia into Germany, and can also place Hungary under its own influence. The merger of Austria and Germany can take two forms: one is open annexation; the other is "unification" annexation, i.e., the Nazi Party of Hitler's faction seizes power in Austria. However, these plans are not only seen by the French bourgeoisie as the "fuse of a new war" from the merger of Austria and Germany, but also opposed by Fascist Italy. Although Italy is united with Germany on other issues, it opposes and undermines Germany's plans in this matter. The recent meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is one of the tricks played by Italy. But the Austrian problem is actually only a part of the Danube problem. Italy wants to merge Austria and Hungary, and if possible, also wants to merge Croatia of Yugoslavia, and place these places under its leadership. France wants to incorporate Austria and Hungary into the Little Entente, creating a "Danube Federation." And Hungary demands revision of the Treaty of Trianon, ceding some territories of Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. Italy supports Hungary's plan, but these three Little Entente countries, relying on the power of France, are unwilling to give in.</p>
<p>The Danube problem and the Balkan problem are closely linked. Italy wants to divide Yugoslavia, ceding Croatia, seizing Dalmatia (the islands on the Adriatic coast), and turning the Adriatic Sea into Italy's "inland sea." At the same time, Italy also wants to resolve the long-standing disputes on the Balkan Peninsula, the conflict between Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece—the Albanian problem. Italy advocates handing over Albania to Bulgaria and Greece.</p>
<p>The dispute between Germany and Poland over Danzig and Upper Silesia is actually a conflict between Germany and France. Similarly, the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia is actually a conflict between Italy and France. The latter also has the North African problem. France and Italy are both vying for leadership in the Mediterranean, vying for the sphere of influence in Savoy and Nice, as well as in the Near East.</p>
<p>The imperialist powers are all frantically arming themselves, preparing for a new imperialist war to resolve their conflicts. But at the same time, the imperialists are also attempting to use the armament they are preparing to attack the Soviet Union in order to alleviate the contradictions between the imperialists. Regarding the issue of the merger of Austria and Germany, due to the opposition of France and Italy, the semi-official newspaper of the German Fascist Foreign Ministry openly published the idea of "unifying Ukraine," because part of the territory of Ukraine belongs to the Soviet Ukrainian Republic. And British imperialism secretly supports Japan's annexation of Manchuria and Mongolia in its Far East policy; and in its European policy, it supports Germany's radical anti-Soviet Union stance. In fact, British imperialism has now replaced the position of French imperialism and become the main organizer of the anti-Soviet Union war. Pacific Problems: In the Pacific, the imperialist division of China is already underway.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism has already occupied the three northeastern provinces, Jehol, and part of Chahar, and is continuing to invade the Pingjin area and preparing to invade Outer Mongolia. Japan has built new naval bases on the Caroline and Ogasawara Islands, which were administered by Germany. Japan is also trying to create a "Dungan state" of nationalities around Dihua.</p>
<p>British imperialism is also invading China. South China is the sphere of influence of British imperialism. It is also seizing Tibet and Xikang to seize Sichuan. The recent independence of southern Xinjiang was manipulated by British imperialism.</p>
<p>French imperialism is active in southern Sichuan through Annam, traversing Yunnan, and Guizhou. The recent news that British troops entered Yunnan is a demonstration by British imperialism to French imperialism.</p>
<p>American imperialism has already lent China 50 million US dollars in cotton and wheat loans, etc.</p>
<p>Due to the conflicts caused by the imperialist division of China, the naval race in the Pacific is becoming extremely tense. But the main reason for the tense naval race is to attack China and deal with the Soviet Union. The United States has passed a bill to expand the navy—naval expenditures have increased to 1,000,000,000 US dollars—and has decided to build two naval bases each in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and also to "survey" the Aleutian Islands. Britain has also passed a naval budget of £56,550,000—an increase of £2,980,000 over last year—and is rushing to build the Singapore naval base and buying Timor Island. France has also occupied nine small islands in the South China Sea of ​​China and is stepping up the construction of military projects. Japan has also passed the budget for the second supplementary naval plan.</p>
<p>Japan's military actions in China and the war between the small countries in South America are preludes to the imminent new world war!</p>

<h3 id="e274">After Reading "Elementary School Natural Science Vocabulary Book" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's advertisement on the 5th stated that the Commercial Press published the "Elementary School Natural Science Vocabulary Book." I was overjoyed because this type of comprehensive dictionary can be said to be an unprecedented book. I immediately went to Qipan Street to buy one. After flipping through it hastily, I was very disappointed. I will write some of it to tell everyone.</p>
<p>(1) Content: Miscellaneous. This book is named Natural Science Vocabulary Book, so it should be a specialized vocabulary book. It should not collect many non-natural science nouns to fill the number. We can see that it is miscellaneous and impure from the twenty-three categories in its classification index. What is even more ridiculous is that the "Games" category is also included.</p>
<p>(2) Inverted Sequence. On the fourth page of the table of contents, the character "芫" is suddenly listed. According to the "芫" character system, it should not be included in the nine strokes, especially the number on page "six zero three" should not be inserted under "three nine six" for no reason. After checking the main text, the character "芫" is actually arranged in the eleven strokes. Is this not an inverted sequence?</p>
<p>(3) Inaccurate Classification. In the "Chemical Industry" category on page 20 of the classification index, there is "Opium," and there is also "Opium" on page 21. After checking the main text, there is "Opium" on page "seven four two," and there is "Opium" on page "nine seven five." This is a repetition, so it does not hurt much. However, there is also an entry of "Cloud" in the same category on the same page, which cannot be understood no matter how much I think about it. Does this vocabulary book have the ability to create "Clouds" by using "Chemical Industry"?</p>
<p>(4) Inappropriate Material Selection. The material selection of this book is inappropriate. Some extremely important nouns are missing, while "Inkstone" and "Brush" (see pages 703 and 705), which are not very relevant to natural science, are included in the book, which is quite inappropriate. Moreover, the annotations under these two nouns purely focus on historical narratives and have no scientific explanation.</p>
<p>(5) Inaccurate Proofreading. Accuracy is the most important thing for a vocabulary book. If there are many errors, it is not only useless but also harmful. The proofreading of this book is inaccurate, and typos are often seen, which is a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a crudely made product. Although the quantity is large, the quality is very poor. There are only more than 200 entries of "Chemical Part" nouns. The rest can be seen. The reporter hopes that the museum can maintain its historical glory, take this book as a warning, and pay more attention to the substantial aspects of future books. It is not only beneficial to the public, but also beneficial to the museum itself. I don't know what the museum authorities think?</p>

<h3 id="e275">Defects of the Rent Reduction Movement Itself <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Mao</p>
<p>I am someone who lives in an attic room, so according to the usual practice of "three sentences without leaving the topic," my words are completely based on the interests of those who live in attic rooms.</p>
<p>Recently, the rent reduction movement in this city has spread like a storm. Many enlightened people have already discussed the inevitability and importance of this movement, so there is no need for me to add anything more. However, I always feel that there are some defects in the movement itself, that is, I have not seen anyone living in an attic room in any alley participating in an organized way.</p>
<p>Is it that people living in attic rooms do not need rent reduction? No! The so-called people living in attic rooms probably include shop assistants, workers, and other wage laborers, as well as various groups of unemployed and out-of-school people. Their incomes are very meager, or even have no income at all. Although the world economic panic and imperialist dumping have caused the entire commercial industry of Shanghai to fall into decline and the economy to fall into bankruptcy, it can be said that only these characters in the attic rooms are most affected. The more the danger of the closure of shops and factories deepens, the greater their unemployment panic becomes. It is often these characters who suffer the cold treatment of the landlords because they have no money to pay the rent. Thus, in the rent reduction movement, it is clear that they should not only actively participate but also become the vanguard of the movement.</p>
<p>So, why don't they participate?</p>
<p>I think this is due to two wrong ideas: on the part of the people living in attic rooms, they always think that their power is too small and they have no right to intervene. It seems that this is just a direct negotiation between the second landlord and the first landlord and the landlord, and it has the meaning of "waiting"—waiting for the movement to have results and enjoying the benefits without any effort. In addition, on the part of the second landlord, they also think that those people are not important. Their participation or non-participation has nothing to do with them, or even is beneficial to them, so they abandon them.</p>
<p>For the sake of the future of the entire movement and for the sake of the individual interests (whether the second landlord or the person living in the attic room), these two concepts should be corrected immediately. Under the general purpose of rent reduction, there is no conflict of interest between the second landlord and the person living in the attic room. With consistent demands, there must be consistent actions. It is certainly not acceptable to only care about one's own interests and not care about the interests of others, and it is equally unacceptable to wait for others to do well and not move oneself. The result will inevitably be disappointment. As for power, it goes without saying. May I ask, since people living in attic rooms suffer even more than second landlords, how can the number of people living in attic rooms be less than that of second landlords?</p>

<p>— Ms. Qie</p>
<p>"The process of life" is a series of cruel and continuous wars, and the entire "life" is a vast battlefield.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, "life" is attacking people fiercely, without any rest. "Life" is a great military strategist, and it adopts a strategy of both offense and defense, and uses a tactic of attacking from the front and back. In front of people, it has set up three solid defense lines, the first one is called the "death line," and the other two are the "starvation line" and the "cold line." The fortifications are heavily guarded and carefully arranged to prevent people's counterattack. On this side, it takes the defensive. On the other hand, it also sends several brave and good-fighting generals to lead a large army to advance on three routes of "clothing," "food," and "housing," pressing and threatening people from behind. On this side, it takes the offensive. In this way, people have become turtles in a jar, and the whole body is surrounded by the heavy troops of "life"!</p>
<p>However, there is an exception here. "Life" does not dare to invade those few lucky ones, because those lucky ones, they are not afraid of "life" and avoid "life." What are they afraid of! They have money as weapons and wealth as a backing. Western-style houses are the Great Wall to resist "life," fields are their base of operations, bills of exchange are spread all over the world like proclamations, and checks are flying around the streets like declarations of war. "Life" is not their opponent at all. They do not need to be enemies with "life," nor do they need to worry about the pressure of "life"; and, in fact, they also need "life." They welcome it, love it, and do not hesitate to use a lot of money to supply it, satisfy it, and make it reach the highest degree of enjoyment. As for "life" itself, you should know that it is not only a military strategist, but also a conspirator. It bullies the weak and helps the strong, and suppresses the poor and aids the rich. As long as the desires of "life" itself are filled, and it overflows and exceeds needs, why should it persecute them?</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of the remaining majority of people, "life" is really too scary—it wears a helmet, is covered in armor, has a treasure knife hanging from its waist, holds a丈八long spear, and is full of murderous aura and full of majesty. The more you want to run away in panic, the more it chases you. Even when it encounters those five or six-year-old scavenger children who have just come into contact with "life," it takes the lead as if facing a formidable enemy, and even shakes its spirits and yells, "The first general is 'life,' see who dares to come and die!" The cruel war has begun like this!</p>
<p>Many, many people are shot to death by "life" in a hail of arrows, but there are still many, many people fighting bloody battles and carrying out a long-term resistance. They are driven by the three armies of "clothing," "food," and "housing" from behind. They have no other choice but to rush forward, trying to break through the terrible "death line" in front and break out a path to survival. Some of them use up all their strength to cross this first defense line, and then struggle on the "starvation line" and the "cold line," and even further overcome "life" and avenge "life," but on the one hand, they still have to be vigilant at any time against the return of "life." There are also some people who have failed because their environment is too difficult. They have been ambushed by "poverty"; when they are fighting with "life," "poverty" colludes with "life" and stands on the same front as "life" and is their enemy. In this way, even if some of them temporarily defeat "life," they are still defeated by it in the end; some are permanently stuck on the "death line," permanently stuck on the "starvation line" and the "cold line," and are deadlocked with "life"; there are also some who finally become prisoners of "life" and are persecuted and sacrificed by it, and there are more than millions of such people! Really, "life" is the most cruel thing. It is a liar, it is not what it seems, it only has a beautiful and empty slogan; its banner clearly says "life" in big letters, but what it leaves for people is often only a dead end!</p>
<p>The society is becoming more and more depressed, and the economic panic is deepening day by day. Therefore, the defense line of "life" is becoming more and more solid, and the fortifications of "life" are becoming higher and thicker. The fierce firepower of "life" is also becoming more and more concentrated on people. It is really not easy for a troubled person to escape its siege and avoid its sharp edge!</p>

<p>Biography of a Celebrity</p>
<h3 id="e279">Darwin (5) <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Jifan</p>
<p>After completing the writing about Darwin's theories, this brief biography is also coming to its final section. However, we cannot but briefly mention the daily life of this giant in his later years, otherwise, we would still have regrets about the record of this scientist's life.</p>
<p>"He is an extraordinary scientist, but his daily life is very ordinary." This is what one of his friends often told visitors to Darwin. True, daily life is always determined by the circumstances of the time. It is not necessarily the case that a "genius" has a life that is beyond the ordinary. For example, Darwin's life in his youth, as we see it, although it also revealed his talent, was nothing more than a typical life of an ordinary young man, with no special features. Darwin's later years were even more affected by his ill health, which greatly affected his work. He really suffered all aspects of life - pain and happiness - he was a brave warrior who had really struggled in life.</p>
<p>However, the lives of people living in the same era naturally inevitably share the same color, which is the generality of life! But every individual also often has more or less different characteristics, which is also a fact, because it is due to the special restrictions of personal life. This is also the source of anecdotes about celebrities. Darwin's family life was extremely happy, and he showed his tenderness and love to his wife. In his book "The Expression of the Emotions," he described his meticulous attention to his children. He said that when children cry, he loves to watch the expressions of children when they cry, but he is often softened, and he comforts and kisses them endlessly before they finish crying. He often joined the children, acting as an age-appropriate companion. The children did not treat him as an old man, and played with him, taking it as entertainment. He never uttered angry words to his children throughout his life, and was also very courteous to his servants. He was very hospitable, and treated his guests with utmost courtesy, often sitting around and chatting, fearing that he could not make them fully happy. Among his friends, Huxley was famous for his eloquent conversation, and Darwin loved to hear his witty remarks; Lyell and Hooker often discussed science, often arguing with each other, without reaching a conclusion. However, Darwin said in his memoirs: "Among the friends I have made, perhaps none is more lovable than Hooker," which shows the depth of their feelings.</p>
<p>Darwin loved art, but his hands were clumsy and he could not draw pictures. He loved music, but his ears were not sensitive and he could not distinguish its rhythms. This is probably a unique shortcoming of giants - his life was very regular in his later years. His eating, sleeping, and sitting all had fixed times. But in terms of diet, he sometimes still retained the innocence of his youth. He loved sweets very much, and doctors often forbade it, and his family did not prepare much, but he could not change it.</p>
<p>"Darwin's Yellow Notebook" is one of the treasures of the London Library, a treasure for those who study Darwin's life. However, during Darwin's lifetime, these booklets were often placed on a shelf above a fireplace. That was Darwin's diary for many years, piled together. The records in it mainly focus on work, such as what day he worked, what day he could not work due to illness, in great detail. From this, we can know that he hated illness very much. In addition, the diaries about travel and returning home are also recorded in great detail. When he had insomnia for several nights and felt dizzy, his wife advised him to travel for a few days, but he always refused to listen, or argued with his wife about the date. Even if he made it clear that he would return in seven days, he always returned one or two days earlier. He cherished time so much in his later years. Here, we can also see that if he had not had the pain of illness, his academic success might have exceeded the limits he had already reached.</p>
<p>Another method he used to cherish time was "not doing something a second time." He said that, for example, many experiments, instead of doing them repeatedly, it is better to pay attention to them thoroughly and do them well once, so that the effort is not wasted. Therefore, he regarded every small experiment as sacred, because he was unwilling to waste time. This point is very worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>He also had a way of cherishing time, that is, to work to the limit of his strength, "I think I should stop here—" then stop, otherwise, he would never give up. He also paid great attention to the progress and intensity of his work, and often maintained the pleasure and interest of his work. When he was extremely busy, he often said to himself: "I am doing it out of pleasure, not out of compulsion!" As for his work spirit, it is even beyond the reach of ordinary people. He regarded things that people considered exceptions or trivial as sacred, and never easily let them go. The second is his stubbornness. This stubbornness refers to his discovery of truth. In his old age, he still loved to read, experiment, and be vigilant about himself.</p>
<p>In short, he lived and died in struggle, in the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>We accept his theory and admire his great personality. We should continue his research and get closer to the truth we are pursuing. (The End)</p>
