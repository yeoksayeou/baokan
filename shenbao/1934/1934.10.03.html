<h3 id="c9">東歐羅加洛條約之觀察　敬 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>日内瓦軍縮會議失敗。國聯席上之會議外交。益瀕於殭死之境。英國既不願深入大陸糾紛之漩渦。法國則出全力以保持其疆域現狀。而德意志之反抗運動迄未少衰。意大利之爭霸中歐。雄心未已。致使不安潮流。汹湧澎湃。國際間之傾軋暗鬥。尤甚於一九一四年大戰勃發之前夕。奥大利前首相陶爾斐斯被剌之際。意德武裝衝突。大有一觸即發之勢。當斯時也。危機四伏。法蘭西及多腦河流域諸國。均將岌岌乎慮捲入狂潮。而重現歐洲之紛亂。所幸德國態度審愼。法國亦不肯冒昧。一團火燄。始歸滅熄。惟根本之禍因。則仍存在。即如奥國之政情。尚未安寗。一旦觸機引火。仍足以禍被全歐也。</p>
<p>顧中歐禍根。猶爲世所共見。英法意德諸大國。尚知所以防備之道。非至不得已時。决不至以武力相拼。故其禍顯。而其爲害或較小也。至於東歐則不然。在德波未妥協之前波蘭惟法國之馬首是瞻。法國欲保持現狀之主旨。貫澈猶易。然至今年一月德波互不侵犯條約成立之後。凡爾賽統係之東北一角。驟形解體。法人深恐德波接近。其霸權將因以失墜。已惴惴不安。如德國再起。其危險更甚。是以巴爾都特就教於華沙。試察波當局之眞意。以爲將來應付之準備。吾人固知波蘭與德諒解。未必有積極破壞凡爾賽和約之意。其所注目之處。殆在烏克蘭之原野耳。至於德意志之目的。無非欲展驥足於東歐。蓋海上有英帝國之抵制。西歐有法蘭西爲之死敵。意大利虎視中歐。亦不許他人稍有踰越。最後一着。惟有取得波蘭之同意。經東普魯士。跨波羅的海岸二小國而東征。求大陸上之發展。以進略國際間所嫉視之蘇聯。</p>
<p>於是愛斯多尼亚。拉多維亚。立陶宛。遂成爲東歐時局之重心。爲德波蘇三國外交逐鹿之塲。其影響及於歐洲全局。實甚巨大。東歐形勢。既次第緊張。德國打開外交孤立之策劃。乃愈見積極。其他姑置勿論。就外交宣傳費用一項。本年度預算爲二萬五千六百萬法郎。意法英諸國均莫能及。（意爲一萬一千九百萬法郎。法爲七千一百萬法郎。英則僅六千九百萬法郎。）據此以觀。德國對外交之努力。固不僅止於樽爼折衝。其與他國國民之諒解運動。亦不少懈。可知其所極力警戒。不僅在法。而尤在於雄據一隅之蘇聯也。</p>
<p>是以法蘇。以利害懸殊。制度矛盾。债權糾紛未了之國。而竟能互相讓步。由諒解而親交由親交而共同保障歐洲安全。法既竭力援引蘇聯加入國聯。更欲簽訂東方羅加洛條約者。豈無故歟。蓋蘇聯立塲。雖與法不同。但其維持和平。則頗具同心。而其圖西部國境綫之安固。隨時隨地努力以制約德意志之奔放。不令其過度膨脹。有碍歐局安全。則亦與法人心理相若。故法蘇協力以謀東歐保安之約。而世界遂轟傳以爲有軍事同盟意味。非全無因也。至於蘇聯用意。是否欲借西歐之安定。以挫日本之兇燄。則尚非吾人所能預測耳。</p>

<p>（東京）　陸軍爲闡明其所懷抱之國策内容於天下起見、印成小册子十六萬部、題爲「國防本義及其强化」、已於昨日公表、其要旨如下、</p>
<p>（一）國防與國内問題　國民之一部享受不勞所得、而大部分則嘗塗炭之苦、致惹起階級對立、此國防上未可輕輕看過者、故須樹立適應全體的皇國之理想之經濟機構、由種種原因之農村窮乏、可以歸納於都巿農村之對立、故由此相互依存及國民共存共榮之全體觀之、應使農村自身之勤勞心、反映都巿、與之呼應、而謀眞正之更生、</p>
<p>（二）國防與思想　須確立確固之國家觀念與道德觀念、努力剷除極端的國際主義之個人主義思想、顯揚民族獨有之文化、防止無批評吸收泰西文化、</p>
<p>（三）國防與武力　消極的國防所要之最少軍備之陸軍、滿洲事變後、治安維持上之區域、漸次擴大、故即由消極的意義、兵力裝備之充實亦極重要、隣接國之空軍勢力已達日本三倍以上、故以現勢力、難期國防之安全、</p>
<p>（四）國防與經濟　立脚於以建國理想爲基礎之道義的經濟觀念、增進全國民之福祉、促進全國民之活動、使視其勤勞得所應得、安定國民大衆之生活、苟不違反國家之要求、應滿足其個人創業欲、以爲現經濟機構之矯正策、</p>
<p>（五）金融機關之整備與稅制改革戰事經濟範圍既廣、應從平時研究之、（二日電通電）</p>

<p>政府與軍部意見似已一致</p>

<p>（東京）　對滿事務局總裁問題、各方面有種種之意見、林陸相·橋本次官·永田軍務局長等最高首腦部僅主張以人物本位、由武官任總裁或次長、此外别無主張、然政府方面既洩露以林陸相兼任總裁之意、則應研究以文官或武官任總裁孰爲便利之問題、關於陸相兼任陸軍方面之意向如下、（一）各方面均希望林陸相兼任、（二）開陸軍大臣兼任之前例、他日必有其他之國務大臣兼任、但此時陸軍大臣有發言權、其次長必以武官任之、故陸軍部内主張由林陸相兼任者亦多、待目下視察軍狀及風災而西下之林陸相歸京、即可决定、以林陸相以外之大中將級人物任總裁、各方面既多反對、陸軍方面亦未考慮及此、（二日電通電）</p>

<p>殆外交策轉變先聲</p>
<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞政府今日辭職、羅王即命首相逹泰勒斯戈組織新政府、據首相聲稱、政府之出此、乃因國君欲於議會重行集議前研究政局、俾覓取解决現有諸問題之方策、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>布哈勒斯　國王加羅爾已委達泰勒斯戈總理另組新閣、據官報稱、内閣辭職俾於國會開會前得一檢討政局之機會、而爲國王出國聘問之準備、内閣改組醖釀已久、但以總理與自由黨領袖布拉鐵拿之異見、久未解决、遂遷延至今、現以文官處長摩夫樂悌已於數日前逝世、總理遂能以已意實行改組、更據接近總理者稱、本人不欲兼任外長、並不欲羅致自由黨人物入閣云、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>布哈勒斯　羅馬尼亚政潮發生、實以鐵社婁斯哥外長之辭職爲導火綫、而外長之出於消極、則以達泰勒斯戈總理不徵求其同意、即擅自採取對外行動之故、兹聞總理已以長電致外長慰留、加羅爾國君亦與外長電話接談、惟聞外長辭意堅决、不願再作馮婦云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　關於羅馬尼亞内閣改組一事、據此間哈瓦斯社代表所知、最初辭職者實係外交部長鐵杜婁斯哥、渠曾屢次表示欲爲羅國外交政策之領袖而担負一切責任、但輒遇阻力、因此灰心云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>總理將自兼外長</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　内閣提出總辭職後、國王仍委託前總理達泰勒斯戈繼續組閣、達氏頃已赴西那雅、向國王提出新内閣名單、第二屆達泰勒斯戈内閣閣員、與其第一屆内閣閣員無甚差别、惟外長鐵杜婁斯哥則將引退、政府方面對於鐵氏態度雖極守緘默、然政界人士則咸信鐵氏拒絶参加新閣、意甚堅决、無可挽回云、新閣將以史德倫茄任工商部長、總理達泰勒斯戈兼代外長、而以德茹瓦拉任外交次長、聞自由黨領袖白拉西亚諾對於達氏新閣、已表示同意云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>讀書指導··</p>
<p>聽得有人說今年是雜誌年，不論文藝作品或理論作品，單行本總是很少出，出了也賣不出去，只有雜誌却洪水一般地在出版界湧現着。不錯，我也覺得事實是這樣，但我以爲，目前的情勢似乎比這還要更極端一點，與其稱之爲雜誌年，似乎倒不如稱之爲小品年還更恰當些。你看，就是雜誌，比較厚一點和硬性一點的，也都很少地方出版了，眞正能够很普遍地流行着的，豈不盡是小品刊物麽？這大概是一般讀書界的趨勢使然的罷。這種趨向是不是好呢？在我個人，我還是希望讀比較有系統的東西，零碎的讀物使目已把握不到一個思想的中心，我覺得益處很少，雖然短小精幹的小品文讀起來有時也很痛快，但似乎總不適於認眞的研究，我這意見是不是错誤？</p>
<p>也許就因爲有這樣的成見呢？在近來的出版物中，我最高興看那中山文化教育館季刊，因爲裏面有好幾篇很有系統很着實的文章，我們認爲最有價值的是「世界思潮的動向」，「蘇俄哲學思潮的檢討」「世界政治的動向」等幾篇，這些文章用很淺近的解說，很簡要的筆法，將現在的世界文化政治情勢給了我們一個縮圖，對於我們將來要理解其他個别問題時，實在有不少的帮助，所以我每篇文章都很仔细地談過了。但我自己的判斷力很弱，我只覺得他們所說的每句話都有理，都正確，不知道是不是有什麽錯誤的或需要批判的地方。我希望你們對這幾篇文章也加以批評，如有什麽不妥之處，請你們指示出來，那麽我們所得到的益處就更多了。</p>
<p>林鈞來信</p>
<p>林君所說出版界的情形，是實在的。小品文，已成爲當前出版界的寵兒，也即是一般讀書界的寵兒，因爲若不是讀書界歡迎，書店老闆决不會這樣高興出版的。站在讀書的利益上來說，過分地只知道談小品，尤其是淺薄無聊的小品，是容易流於低級趣味，結果當然不好的。但好的小品，對於社會現實的病痛能巧妙地給以暴露，加以針砭，我們讀了，能認識社會現實的許多黑暗面，有時長篇大論的大文章所注意不到的地方，也能够讓我們明白地看見，這一點，就是小品文的好處，也就是小品文值得談的地方。當然，我們也不能因爲小品文有這點好處，就只知道專讀小品。小品文，因爲短小，說話只能抓着一面，而顧不到事物的全面，讀小品文時，如果自己思想没有一個基礎，每每就被它引到很偏狹的意識中去，固執着一面的道理，而不能認議事理的變化，這是很危險的。所以，小品文不能拿來專門談，談小品文，必須先研究堅實的理論，使思想有把握，有系統，才不致受到害處。站在這一點上來說，林君對於目前出版界太偏重小品的傾向發生不滿，我們是十二分表同情的，我們的文化界還是很幼稚，我們尚需要更多的理論堅實的名著。（未完）</p>

<p>第二回　作賈人民間路回永壽别家來大上人到長安</p>
<p>這孩子的父親，已是到甘肅來的第三代了。不幸在民國十八年，被軍官硬逼迫着去當兵，帶到西安來了。兩個婦人，中年的老了，壯年的，也變成中年了，小女孩子也大了，他們想着這樣混下去，也不是辦法，甘肅又十分苦，種地的人，也不能吃飽呢，何况一家是三個婦女，所以把家抛棄了，找到西安來。他們說··縱然找不到這孩子的父親，這孩子的舅舅是個戲子，聽說也在西安，也許可以找得到。就是再找不着，願意把這女孩子給人，聘禮是不收，只要能安頓　兩個年紀大的婦人，作三房四妾都是願意的。老李，你說這件事好聽不好廳，可惜我是客中不能久住，要不然，這樣的便宜事，爲什麽不幹？李士廉笑道··你打聽得這樣清楚，大概眞有此心。賈多才道··我眞想不到那窮苦地方，會出這樣的好女孩子。他那長長的藍花布褂子，又紅又白的臉兒，兩隻耳朶上戴着兩個白色的耳圈子，當然，這不是白金的。唯其不是金子的，可以看出來這孩子也合了那句話，愛好是天然。嗐！他這印像是付與我太深了。說着，拿起酒壺斟上一杯酒，端起杯子來，簡直的蓋在鼻子尖上。放下酒杯子來，扶起了筷子，只管去撥弄碗裏的菜，依然不住的摇頭，回味那所看到的美人兒。李士廉笑道··對了，這個人是不錯。賈多才道··你這句話，盲從得無味極了。你怎麽知道那個女孩子長得不錯？李士廉道··我有一個消息，還没有告訴你呢。你猜我今天是妻那裏去了。說時，將頭連連擺了幾下，表示那得意的神氣。（三一）</p>

<p>— 易生</p>
<p>俗語說··「行行出狀元。」掉一句文，呌做··「無地無材。」說書的人在從前時候，因爲仗着一隻嘴換飯吃，長年流轉江湖，給大衆稱爲「吃空心飯的江湖朋友。」他們社會上是没有什麽高尚的地位的。可是，凡事不可一概抹煞，老聽書的當没有不知，在清末時有一個著名的彈詞家馬如飛，今人所彈唱的珍珠塔，是經他修改過的脚本，所以特别雅馴而有趣。恐怕很少有人知道他有不可及的藝術家的天才，我就述一則他的軼事，是我在童年時聽得先父講的。</p>
<p>我們的故鄉是寳山縣屬的羅店鎭。鎭上每逢新歲，有很盛的所謂馬燈舉行，（就呌出馬燈）須從元旦到元宵每夜遊行；茶館的主人也都聘了說書先生奏藝娛客，作爲點綴新年的有興事件。在我家對門，恰有一所舊屋，内有一間寛敝而破敗的大廳，正設着茶館。在某年的新歲裏，那對鄰的茶館也請到一位說書先生，就是馬如飛，他登壇的第一晚，說書未久，正當神氣漸來的時候，忽然喧鬧的鑼鼓聲愈傳愈近；滿廳的茶客都知道是馬燈來了，一窩蜂地出廳沿街看燈。廳上剩那獨據書壇的馬君留着，他不免大爲掃興，没奈何也祇得點起了脚根，隨衆瞻仰一下門外馬燈的盛况，覺得果然是「燈會處處會出，各有巧妙不同」。經過長時間會纔走盡，茶客紛紛返座，意中都好似吃了熊掌，回頭來等候吃魚的模樣。不料馬君反不急急於續說那横遭剪斷的書，却是，理三絃，掃喉嗓，重來開篇的一篇「馬燈賦」像熟讀着一般的背唱出來，把剛纔門前經過的燈會裏行列，和雜陳的百戲，自頭至尾依次描叙，毫無顚倒脫落，而且有聲有色。聽衆就都反覺得剛纔過的燈會是像魚的滋味，而這時聽到的燈會賦是像熊掌了丨在唱一句喝一個滿堂彩聲中，開篇完而說書規定的時間也已過了。如此天才，就把古人曹子建七步成吟來相比，也祇能當塲做一首四句七言時，没有做得古風相似的這麽一長篇，而且有特别好的記性，眞是講到了也覺得他的可愛哩！</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>在下有位朋友，他的尊姓，恰與「僵字諧音。而且他的脾氣也僵，所處的境地也僵。稱他爲「僵先生」，眞是確切不移，簡直還有些可憐。</p>
<p>僵先生是紹興人氏··他生成是個僵性。老妻早已作古，也没有續弦，又没有子女。隻身寄跡海上，恃教讀爲生活。戴上老光眼鏡，專講詩云子曰，是個純粹的老學究。他走起路來，規行矩步，身體直僵僵。說起話來，一語不苟，板板六十四。倘有人和他講幾句笑話，他就要正襟危坐而言曰··「孺子不可教也，吾與汝，止於畫。」前有某姓家，請他坐館。因地位狹小，呌他睡在擱樓上。他以擱先生之名不雅，怫然道··「士可殺，不可辱也。是可忍，孰不可忍。」竟不别而行，其僵有如此！</p>
<p>僵先生在繁華的上海，已有悠久的歷史。俗語說··「樹高千丈，葉落歸根。」他感着年老多病，於是對明月而思故鄉，浩然有歸志。還做了幾首七律的詩，遍告親友。說是臨别贈言，也算假此發發窂騷。不料過了幾個月，有人見他仍在馬路上踱着方步。便問道··「田園將蕪湖不歸？」他囁嚅着答首··歸去終要歸去，不過行期未定。後來人家纔明白，他欲行又止，實在有不得已的苦衷。原來他生平以節儉自持，眞所謂「一芥不以予人」。所以歷來束脩所得，倒積有幾千塊錢。若帶了這筆錢回去，便好比「衣錦還鄉」。難免要引起族人們的覬觎，委實有些危險。而且這是心血的結晶，日後若舉以相贈，也大非所願。因此躊躇滿志，欲歸不得。仍舊寄人籬下，度其枯寂而單調的生活。有時他嘆着說··「一個人没有錢，固然要僵。我有了幾個錢，也弄得大僵特僵。奈何奈何，我其長爲僵先生以終乎。」他個人的歸宿，和金錢的處置，業已成了僵他。終究没有解决之法！</p>

<p>「啊！春天眞是一年中最可愛的一個季節！」空氣中的一片春意，似乎也已給予了太后相當的影響；有一天，伊忽然向我感嘆道··「在這種天氣裏，人眞像又回到了年輕時候去！春天本來是屬於年輕人的！」</p>
<p>接着，伊又用很美妙的音調，默念了一首唐代大詩人李太白的春曉詩··</p>
<p>「春眠不覺曉，處處聞啼鳥：</p>
<p>夜來風雨聲，花落知多少！」</p>
<p>太后對於詩詞，很有相當的欣賞··我雖然並不曾看見伊自己寫過什麽詩詞，但往往聽見伊在背誦古詩。在中國古代的許多大詩人中，伊所最贊美的便是李白，凡是李白所做的詩，伊差不多全讀過，或者可以說是全能默誦出來。因爲太后這樣的愛好李詩，以致造成了一種風氣，那時候朝中一班文臣，凡有吟咏，幾乎無不以極力摹倣李白的格調爲能事··偶然給太后見到了，隨便稱賞一兩句，這些人便像受了什麽榮典一樣的高興，就此自命不凡，以爲眞能追步青蓮了。其實太后的詩學也祇是很淺薄，倒是對於中國古代的歷史和那些比較有名的稗史或傳奇等等，伊可說是的確有幾分研究，爲尋常人所不及。（一四一）</p>

<p>蜂房即蜂窠，以其分隔似房故名；蜂普通分三種，曰蜜蜂，黑蜂，（俗名鐵頭蜂）黄蜂，（俗名長脚蜂）蜜蜂家養者爲多，用以釀蜜，供諸藥品或作食物，用途之廣，爲飬蜂者依之營生，黑蜂則鑽木穴居，故在舊宅與老樹之間，是其集居之處，惟黄蜂能營窠，大多在樹林之中，搆造旣費時日，形狀尤甚奇特。吾家之花園中，植有白皮松一株，迄今二百餘年矣，枝幹茂盛，大可合抱，爲吾邑冠，某歲爲狂風吹倒，旋以木支撑，故其枝葉並不甚高。某日夕陽初下，與二三知已，譚坐樹下，見上有蜂房，黄蜂十餘綴焉，或曰是螫人，請除之。余悄然愛之，徐言曰：「吾見其始也，以一蜂始，抱樹枝，咒膠沬而爲繫，初若刺，漸若　菌，今若桮，一房成，則一子育，螫然垂羽而伏息者，皆一蜂所呴而孶也。夫匹夫起立錐之壤，櫛風沐雨，勞晝夜，幸少就堂構，聚子孫矣。一旦强暴猝起而寇奪之，雖忍者聞之，嘆而有悲色，吾願以悲夫人者，爲物悲也。爾等靜之，弗喧弗擾，雖吾儕羣集其下，而蜂則來自來，去自去，决不相螫，夫世人之毒在心，而蜂之毒徒在尾也」。諸人頷之，余乃引而逼視，並不驚，以草微撼之，或飛不旋止，有集吾衣者，亦無螫人意，諸君試觀蜂房之綴處，沾若膠漆，風雨所弗能敗，否則無以勝羣蜂，今且大如盤矣。</p>

<p>教局長潘公展在本巿第三區教育會會員大會演講</p>
<p>主席、各位同志、今天是本巿第三區教育會會員大會、邀兄弟來講幾句話、兄弟能够藉這個機會和各位先生把近來對於教育方面的一點感想貢獻出來、覺得非常的高興、</p>
<p>在近一兩年來、尤其這一年來、各位大概在報紙上、雜誌上、或其他書本上、一定可以看到許多關於教育的批評、因爲國難一天一天加重、世界局勢一天一危險、大家就感覺得教育事業也是跟着一天一天急、而我們這班大教育界服務的人、不問是教育行政機關或學校裏的人、所負的責任也是一天一天重大起來、這許多批評、大概說起來、各位都可以知道、是在那裏指摘、爲什麽有國難、爲什麽受到九一八、一二八這許多重大的恥辱而竟没有方法武力抵抗到底、其遠因都歸罪到教育的失敗、惟其以往教育事業没有辦好、因此辦了幾十年新教育、結果非但不能把中國救出危險的境界、而且危險一天天加重、這顯然的是教育的失敗了、如果再因循敷衍五年十年、恐怕國際壓迫的趨勢不能再讓我們安然等待這悠久的時期、自然應該迅速的把所認爲失敗的教育改造過來、</p>
<p>在這個要求改造教育的大前提之下、就有許多人想改造的方案、以往教育的失敗是大家承認的、而改造的方案當然各有不同、譬如某人生了很厲害的病、自必請醫生診治、而中醫有中醫的醫法、西醫有西醫的醫法、同樣的中醫或西醫、或許也有不同的醫法、所以、改造教育的大前提之下、開出來的方案也各有不同、不過現在顯然有一個共同的趨向、認爲以往的教育不能造就一班學生使他們畢業以後能發生一　種力量什麽力量呢、就是救自己救國家的力量、以往的學生、不要說没有救國家的力量、實在連救自己的力量都没有、祗要看今年暑假北平天津以及上海一部份的大學畢業生有所謂職業運動、就可以暴露我們的教育不但不能使學生有救國的力量、並且不能使學生有救自己尋飯吃的力量、所以改造教育就要從這地方着想、怎樣使這些學生至少先有自救的力量、自救的力量果眞有了、救國的力量也就隨之而生、這種教學生自救救國的教育、爲今後的教育一定應走的路綫、就是生産教育或職業教育、吳稚暉先生最近在晨報上寫了長篇大論、說職業教育實在是很好的、可是在中國人的耳鼓、往往不屑聽、職業教育一這個名詞、以爲不是正統而是旁支、大都輕視牠、還不如稱爲「生産教育」大家或者可以重視一些、總之、不問職業教育或生産教育、一般人都想把從前專門做做文章、談談法律、討論討論社會科學的教育、設法改造一下、使每個學生有生産的能力、這種生産能力、使他將來離開學校以後、可以自救救國、所以生産教育是今後改造教育的一個共同的趨向、現在從中央政府起到各省巿地方政府、以至教育界的人士、無不認爲今後祗有這一條生産教育的大路是應該走的</p>

<h3 id="c226">論提倡科工 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>如果配稱爲一個現代的中國人，誰敢冒世界的大不韙，對於提倡科工表示異議呢！寫小說的編戲的都是人，都是需要享受現代的生活的，他們再也不會豎起反對科工的叛旗。假使，小說戲劇的價值，眞不過是一種消閒的玩具，那麽，在科工不發達的國家，連生活的最低限度的資源都没有，那有餘力和餘暇來消遣玩具！照此說來，文學家的期待科工發達的熱忱，應該比任何人都急迫。萬一眞是因爲文學太猖狂的緣故，連累到中國科工的没落，那麽，祇須中國一般研究科工的先生們能够挺身出來負責任地說一句：「中國在幾何年之内，就可以不買外國貨，幾何年之内，就可以不聘請外國人做工程師。」我相信一般從事於文學的工作者，爲着要使自己的生活托福於科學家工藝家的賜與，一定都願意在他們指定的年限内，大家遵照台命，自動地放下筆管，靜候科工的發展的。倘若也有用得着文學的工作者爲他們助興，爲他們摇旗呐喊的時候，祇須他們吩咐，誰都高興効勞的。</p>
<p>我但求中國科工所以没落的原因，的確是這樣的單純！我决不希望中國科工的没落，還有比此更複雜的原因。爲的是要提倡科工，祇須停辦一兩種文學刊物，兩三種文藝的報屁股就够了，豈不輕而易舉嗎？</p>
<p>文學是莫測其高深的東西，好壞的標準，如同朝晚的巿價，令人捉摸不定的。所以，有些人一輩子研安文學，一輩子没有希望，不過浪費寳貴的時力而已。一個年青人學書不成，去學劍，又不成，再去研究文學，眞是自尋死路，毫無意思。我相信文學這東西，自己高興研究，才去研究的，要勒令一個對文學不感什麽趣味的人去研究文學，簡直是虐政。人們可以勉强研究科工而得成功，但决不能勉强研究文學而變成爲文學家，因爲文學非可學而能的。世界大文豪從文學系出身的極少；蕭伯納羅曼羅蘭高爾基並没有受過充足的教育。有清一代，專以文學取士，並没有産生一個文學家；而曹雪芹施耐庵未聞有顯赫的科名。所以停辦文學系，未必是燬滅文學，廣設文學系，未必是提倡文學。文學是用不着提倡的，提倡也不過這樣；文學也用不着咀咒的，咀咒也不會那樣。事實上，大家去研究文學這回事，是絶對没有的。我壓根兒不相信這無用的文學，究竟能發生多大的壞影響可以連累到中國科工的没落！如果說中國科工的没落，完全是受了文學的影響，那未免太重視文學了。我敢斷言，中國科工的所以没落，一定另有更重要的原因在。</p>
<p>在革命以前，中國的學制，雖不免有蹈空之弊，但，關於農情，森林，畜牧，礦産，鐵路，紡織，以及醫藥等等，各省都有專校，大學設有專系，至少，年年由國庫派送的留洋生，研究科工的總是佔其大多數。爲什麽這些富有技能的專門家，出校以後，回得國來，都是一籌莫展？這原因，一半是由於革命以前的政府，不負分配調濟的責任，使人才有相當發展的餘地；一半是由於民衆不肯投資設立工廠，帮助專門家有試騐抱負的可能。其中，未嘗没有立志從事科工的專家，出其全力籌設一個小規模的工廠；但，中國人是祇許成功，不許失敗的。這些人大抵因爲遭受一次的打撃，就一蹶不振，難以爲繼了。最後，不是消沉没落，就是完全抛棄所學，另尋生活的門徑。社會上有的是這樣的榜樣，後來者再也没有勇氣繼續嘗試了，於是，機會較好的，便投身政界充當一個也算是專門性質的科學宫：蹩脚一些的，便混跡在學校裏做一個科學的教書匠；最倒霉的，也祇能和一般無聊的文人一樣，流落在亭子間裏，專寫科學的洋八股，換洋版稅來生活。像這種情形，中國科工的前途，怎能有發揚的希望！我祈禱提倡科工的吳先生，多多在這方面寫文章，督促現代一般學科工的年青人，勿蹈過去的覆轍，立刻發起救國儲金，開設幾個小規模的工廠，把學科工的專門家請出來，拿貨色給民衆觀。我希望在最近的將來，就有一個「造紙廠」和「毛織廠」出現，如果有人規規矩矩發起這一件事，我决計當了褲子承認一股，並且容許主持其事的專門家，有接連三次失敗的機會。至於科工與文學的關係，還不免是一個「虚索題」，雖然說得頭頭是道，我們總覺得不落邊際。</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>老菱，殘荷，紅棗。</p>
<p>在北平，到秋天是少不了這三樣點綴的。街頭巷尾以及茶座上，小販按着耳朶仰天長喊，他帶着一把菱剪，在成交時很「利落」地剪好了墊在荷葉裏遞給你。當自家的荷花缸已經空了時，公園北海還可以看到半池枯殘了的荷葉，有人修剪，深怕黄楬的敗葉把時間拖了走似的。長棗，圓棗，酸棗，慢慢地在樹上紅了，有時候是不等到紅人們便給打了下來，半青的棗是没有蟲子的，自熟落地的很少好棗。尤其是北平的孩子們，一到秋天如果自己家裏没有棗樹便指盼着誰家的矮牆破壁上會有棗樹枝往外垂，於是竹竿嘩啦嘩啦，孩子們且吃且樂，城墻上的毫縫裏長出來的小棗樹是够費心眼的，然而越是用了力的收穫越甜。　人，是會無事自忙的，在閒了的時候。</p>
<p>公園裏少了遊客，茶座上空空的，可是來回閒蹓躂的人倒不少，這是眞來散步的人，往往在夏天來至茶座喝茶的人是凑熱鬧，爲的是看看人家的雅興，讓人家看看自己的閒情。這樣，便算是逛了。</p>
<p>代替地，電影院與戲院買賣又興隆起來，炎夏使人裏足，爲了炭酸氣的臭與汗臭，到秋天，却又復活了，名伶們大排好戲，戲票總是前一星期便銷去大半，不用奇怪北平哪來的那麽多戲迷，因爲北平嗜戲的人是各界都有，車夫們在夜來等買賣時都會來兩段，對着他們主人正在逍遥享樂的大樓。學生以至教授，都是戲園的顧客，這就呌「京班」戲嘯！</p>
<p>人說南方人好吃，其實北平又何獨不然？秋天的肥蟹在菜塲裏誘惑人，報紙上登着飯館的「新到大蟹」的廣告，那是只有不算錢的大爷們才去，因爲得三四毛一隻，自家買來煮的多。</p>
<p>羊肉在北平是比猪肉還能銷的，特别是秋天的三種吃法：涮，烤，炒。有特别馳名的老舖，不過差不多每個飯舖都有，挺熱的混着葱醬蒜等等的作料吃着眞是另有一番滋味，這是北平一個很有味的點綴，到時候接姑奶奶外甥地吃羊肉是像煞有介事的。</p>
<p>中秋節是少不得兔兒爺與月餅，免兒爺也改良了，有坐汽車坐飛機的，摩登起來，只是那副蠢模樣是改不了的，人還覺得新鮮呢。粟子也賤，一毛二一斤，到年底可以賤到五六分錢一斤。「節」是人們忘不了的。</p>
<p>在悄悄對着秋天發愁的人是千百倍於舒眉微笑的，一起秋風，人們記起冬天的凛冽，煤料與寒衣全是問題，已將寒衣送進高牆的人便計算着怎麽弄出來。</p>
<h3 id="c228">宇間小話 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>三·命定的飄流</p>
<p>月亮的小，慣看星的人都很知道，因爲他常走過兩願距離三兩度的星間，綽有餘裕。而兩顆間的三兩度距離，都是向來看了很短的。月亮在星間穿過，是天空的美麗現象之一，不過這要在新月殘月時才能看清楚，所以看星的人對於滿月到不及一般人有趣味。秋夜的特别明亮的滿月，使秋河，及多數的星全被淹没，幾乎可認爲恨事，單有月而無星，使天空的趣味失去大半。平常人看月，也都希望有點微雲。形成烘雲托月，果眞清朗到萬里無雲，也就反嫌單調。通常看來，月是靜的，借雲可以看作他動，就更有主氣。識星的人則所見的月本是動的，而星不見就不大容易捉摸，而月亮反似靜止在天球上，隨天而轉了。</p>
<p>幸好滿月的光，也遮不住二等以上的星。所以剩下的可數的！大致都在一口氣所能數完的數目以下丨星還可以做標識。譬如這次中秋節前夜看見月在室宿之西，中秋夜却見他在室宿之東了。在現在這室壁兩宿丨這兩宿是天空的大四方形，天黑後向正東看，大概誰都可以認識丨每天都可看見的時候，我們每夜看他與月亮的距離，是很可意呸的。約每二十七天多，月亮就又走回到室宿，這是他在天上游了一週。</p>
<p>他這樣的周游，我們當認爲愉快。西洋的月神是好游的，不過好大概産生於游獵時代，所以只是在森林中漂蕩。中國的月神則在專制制度後變過質，她是富貴神仙，每天住一座旅邸，所謂宿，就是宿所的意思。現在一定還把他讀作秀，是並無道理的。二十八宿就是她周游二十七天多所每天住居的。現在的舊歷本上，每天還注什麽「火房建」之類的話，其中的房字，原意就是表示月所在的宿，可惜因二七又三分之一與二八之差，早已不凖確了。不過如就本年八月十五所注，加上九宿，以後每三循環再加一宿，仍可大致不差。這不僅增多我們看月的興趣，且由此可認識二十八宿。</p>
<p>無論人怎樣替月亮定下了每天的宿所，月亮的週游，到底還不過是漂流。宿所的路線是固定的，而她的行程則忽上忽下，她的圓缺也不與一週相應。用天文學的解釋，自然可以說得頭頭是道，但我們就知道那一切，也只使我們感到她的漂流，原來是定命。</p>
<p>不但這些已知規律的行動，完全是定命，就現在所尚未清楚的月亮或許逐漸脫出地球引力，而飛往别處；或許逐漸增加重量而更近地球，或許被未可知的力量將她掃除，無論遭遇那一種，也都還是定命。我們是會測知月亮有一個定命的，不知月亮知道不知道，就人類對本身的定命並不大肯承認想，她大概也不是知道吧。</p>

<p>— 袁澈</p>
<p>先前我曾經在本報上披露過「希望之一」，說「我們這一批不十分性外國文字而又在尋求外國遺産以從事習作的青年，是不能不感謝近十年來的翻譯家的。所以目前我倒並不怎樣希冀偉大的創作産生，却是很熱烈地盼望多翻譯一些外國的文學名著過來」。因此，最近看見了「譯文」月刊的出現（第一期九月十六日在生活書店出版）我個人方面不僅感到十分歡迎，像「缺乏母乳的嬰兒」一旦得着了奶媽似的，而且敢冒昧地舉起雙手，代表一般與我一樣研究文學的青年們表示熱烈的歡迎哩。</p>
<p>雖然就「譯文」月刊的「前記」看來，譯者諸先生只是一偶然讀點外國作品，偶然翻譯了起來」印出「給喜歡看譯品的人們作爲参考而已」；並不願意故意堂而皇之豎起譯事的大旗，經營移殖外國文學遺産的公司，乳哺我們這些「常常啼飢號寒於陋巷之中」的嬰兒的。然而，我却要說只是讀了第一期後，在我個人方面，就一直覺得是飽飲一頓資養料豐的牛乳了。因爲這家新開的店子，在「自信尚不至於存心潦草」的老實招牌下面，還出現着好幾個十年來就曾經提煉過外國好牛乳給我們吃過的老技師，雖然有的已穿着和從前不同的外衣，使我們一時不敢點頭招呼起來，但一飲之後，就馬上恍然明白了。</p>
<p>想來和我同感的青年，一定是很多的。但願這家新店子按時開門，並且擴充營業（出版叢書）不要使我們熱烈舉起來的手，冷冷地落了下去。</p>
<p>這是希望實現之後，又來一個希望。</p>

<p>「她丨丨她去呌了。」馮文先生呐呐地說着，像没頭蒼蠅打旋似地，又在室内轉了幾下，出去了。出去了，接着，又跟冬生瘤乎一路吵着嘴回來。</p>
<p>「我說過了，没有法想的，没有法想的。」</p>
<p>「你會說現成話。丨丨說句没有法想，可就完了嗎？」</p>
<p>「不完怎麽樣丨丨我了吊不住另人家脚嘯丨丨」</p>
<p>「吊不住脚怎麽了？」大生先生接着說下去。冬生　手揮着薑節似的乎，拐着脚，進了這暗室。看一看小房間裏擠滿了穿橙黄色操衣的人，怔住了，一時回不出話來。</p>
<p>「如銅爸丨丨如銅格爸喲丨你倒來一會兒看！」剛揀這二不接話中間，從灶間突然送來了女人底聲音。</p>
<p>馮文先生又在室内打旋起來了。</p>
<p>「你去，你老婆呌你呀！」大生先生知道馮文先生這窘迫的緣故了說。「一切要的東西，跟我家夥計要去，以後好算賬的。班長們供應，你總要先去預備嘯。」</p>
<p>「那麽，大生哥，這里事，全托你，全托你了。」這時候，馮文先生覺得鄉長也不人當的了！立正！舉槍！立你媽的！舉什麽鳥？</p>
<p>「你說呀，你怎麽說没辦法呀？」</p>
<p>老一嚮在那班長和那些橙黄色操衣們面前怔住的冬生瘤乎，好像斷了氣似地，站在黑賬桌底一角。惟恐又送過「錫茄烟」和「洋火腿」來那麽地發楞。給大生先生一問，這才驚醒過來，應了幾聲「哦！哦。」終於也就顫顫地說了。</p>
<p>「哦哦，跑了三天，也也也兜了三天，没第二個個個上門了。」</p>
<p>「唔！」大先生先皺皺眉，撂一撂下巴。接着又看到班長底眼光像貓眼那麽個綠，炯炯地。</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>據昨日報載，九一八三周年紀念日，日本名古屋新聞登一時評，題爲「亚細亚大陸建設事業已入第二步之華北工作期，」此文論述已往侵略朝鮮滿洲的經過，及今後併吞我國的步驟。日人野心，暴露無遺。</p>
<p>該時評起首即曰：「今日適值滿洲事變之第三周年，吾人心中所感得者，即日本對於亚細亚大陸政策之使命，永久而且重大也。」次云：「至於亚細亚大陸之使命，全繋於我日本國民。自滿洲事變發生後，即爲吾等使命實現的時期。」雖寥寥數語，已將整個日本國對我所懷的陰謀，坦白宣揚出來，大足以喚醒國人的迷夢。</p>
<p>「至滿洲國之建設工作，漸形順利。同時日本希望華北之政治工作，亦日趨恊調。即日本今已進一步，立於華北政治工作之時期。換言之，吾人已逢到第二大陸建設事業之時期。」這又是一段何等爽快的表白。在這里，他告訴我們，日本的大陸政策，不但已告初步的成功，而且已進入第二步的時期。關於日本的大陸政策，他們究竟分作若干時期，外人實無從探知。</p>
<p>該文中又曰：「但日本在亚細亚大陸所負之重大使命，雖已由創造滿洲國開始，然不得謂爲已盡其責。吾人當以中國全體，亚細亚全體爲目標，以文化的經濟的，力謀一致融洽，由創造滿洲國之事業，進而推至中國犬陸，使與日本國民發生同情同感，成爲一體不離之關係。此吾人對滿之最大理想也。」這幾句更寫得有聲有色，未知國人見了，將作何感想？</p>

<p>— ＴＴ</p>
<p>夜是死一般的寗靜。</p>
<p>月亮高高的縣掛在碧朗的天空，遠遠地，送來了斷斷續續的爆竹聲，隠約地在我的身朶震盪着。</p>
<p>這兒的僻靜，與其說是好像戰後的殘墟，毋寗說是鬼域的所在，更來得逼眞點。在這鬼域裏寄住着的我，雖活生生地佔據了地球上一粒豆大的面積，可是我却未敢相信我還是人世間的一員小卒，因爲在這兒一切都令人懷疑着生的存在呢。</p>
<p>我到此地來，大約該有二個多月吧。在這二個多月中除了必要出門之外，鎭日裏祇是躱在這一間破碎而又古舊的小屋裏；不是睡覺，就是呆坐，有時也履行着我的壞習慣，蹁起方步來。一邊蹁方步，一邊唸着我一向喜歡唸的黄仲則做的「十有九人堪白眼，百無一用是書生」的一首律詩。疲倦了，我又倒下了披在地下的草蓆上，我的臥榻瞌下眼皮，　現實的人生，消　在夢裏。</p>
<p>今夜，月亮格外的圓整，遠處又傳來了幾聲爆竹，想來是中秋佳節吧。</p>
<p>每逢佳節倍思親，我也何曾不是這樣呢？固然，在我這一次的行爲上，我已是充分地表現着絶無情感的鐵石心腸者了，不過，爲了此，我不知暗地裏流了幾多眼涙，到了不得不出走一的天，我才忍痛離開了老家。</p>
<p>提起了離家那一天，除了放聲號哭之外，還有什麽法子可以拯救内心的疼痛呢？</p>
<p>冷清清的早上。太陽剛正露出了山尖，除了庭前的槐樹枝上的小鳥，唱着牠的晨歌之外，大地是那麽地沉寂。案頭的鬧鐘推醒了我，我於睡眼惺忪之中，爬下床來，引長　頸探望着窗外，我吃了一驚，天色呌我知道時候已是不早了。我怱忙穿上衣服，帶了一隻籐包，告别了我的臥室，一直朝外間走，可是，剛正踏出了家門，脚脛就好像癱軟下去，一陣心酸眼涙無從制止的籔籔地滾下來。我推測着他們發覺了我突然離開了家庭，一聲也不告訴他們，不知要如何的傷心。媽媽哭腫了眼晴，弟弟妹妹各自垂涙的幾張臉孔，立刻浮現在眼前似的，可是，爲了自己，我終於咬緊了牙關帶着剌痛的心，果斷地朝江邊的碼頭走。從那天直到現在，我便與家庭斷絶了一切。在今夜的月光下，吃着月餅的弟妹們，不知道還會意着他的没有下落的哥哥不？</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個十八歲的青年，受過　等教育，現在一家書局裏服務。生活雖不舒適，但也不十分困苦。近來我爲了家庭間的意見，常常發生衝突，感覺到一種煩悶。所以特寫信給先生，請你替我解决下下。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：我有父母，都在四十歲左右，只有我一個兒子，所以很愛我。他們的頭腦雖不過分腐敗，但也不新；也極富保守性。而我既是一個青年，受了環境的薰淘，所以我的思想比較急進，並且喜動厭靜，因此我們父子間在思想上，行動上，處處都是意見分歧，我又是年少好勝，往往爲了討論某一問題，而發生很大的理論上的爭執，雖然結果多是由我屈服，容忍而了事，但有時我也曾不顧父母的勸告，依照自己的意思做去，這樣，不但他們非常生氣，而我也十分痛苦。我常常這樣想：對於父母還是忍耐點吧，何必硬爭什麽道理呢？但一遇到他們的思想與行爲如有不對時，（譬如他們是很迷信的。）我又忍不住的要說幾句，向他們勸解，糾正他們的錯誤。可是結果他們反把我說了一頓，但是他們的理由却是不正確的，毫無根據的。</p>
<p>還有我很歡喜和朋友談談，或参加什麽朋友間的聚會，可是我的父母總是阻止我，說我浪費，空耗精力；又說在這世風不古，人心險惡的時代，交友很多危險；一個不小心　　　外界的　　，趨向墮落之途。但是我知道我的朋友都是很正直的，很誠實的，不但毫無弊害可言，並且在那朋友之間，很能得到許多知識。因此又常常引起爭論，精神上很爲煩悶。先生：假使呌我諸事屈服，完全依照父母的意思吧，似乎太難忍受了；但是依照自己的意志做去，向家庭反抗吧，我又覺得不對，而且没有反抗的必要和理由。這個問題呌我怎樣解决它呢？請先生給我一個指南。我想天下和我同處着一樣環境的青年一定很多吧。敬頌　撰安　俊彦上</p>
<p>編者按：俊彦君所提出的是一個常見的家庭思想衝突的問題。在父母這方面，却認爲是非常愛護他們的子女，但因他們不能了解青年的性情，每因愛之太甚，常常過分干涉他的子女們的思想和行動，以致發生一種相反的結果。這個問題，編者認爲是一件很重要的家庭教育的問題，實有公開討論的價值，希望讀者代表父母或子女雙方面來儘量的發抒高見。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在二先生心中，他眞覺得鳳雲這種人眞是愛管閒事，幹嗎要擔心到别人的頭髮上來呢？實在說，他何嘗不知道，總有那末一天，大家的辮子都要給剪掉的，因爲他知道，專制改爲民國，已經是不可阻撓的事，而且他也就很贊成共和政體。中國自甲午之役以後，積弱不振，也許改變一個政體，就會强盛起來。不過一條又黑又長的辮子，對於他也實在不捨得剪掉，而明顯的拖下來，又不免給人譏笑他不够文明，所以彼此顧全，只有藏在帽子下，才是一個辦法。然而他這種苦心，却是不容易使人了解的。可不是麽，這時候鳳雲兄也還要說上一句：</p>
<p>「可是我却不管這些，民國由它民國好了，關於辮子的鳥事。要我藏起來，我才不高興哩。」</p>
<p>鳳雲兄說話，常是這樣衝口而出的，芷齋也祇好不置否可的哼了一聲，接上是微微的一笑。</p>
<p>鳳雲是以檢牛糞爲職業的，他不敢再多耽擱工夫，背起糞箕來預備和芷齋分手了，最後一句話：</p>
<p>「好了，你們兄弟一家三派，大哥是一條辮，二哥是辮上盤，三哥却是一個和尚了。」哈哈大笑幾聲，他去了。可是剛走幾步，却又回轉頭來說：</p>
<p>「芷齋兄，可别生氣哩。少陪了，我還要尋牛屎去。」</p>
<p>芷齋苦笑着望着他走去。他想：對於這種人眞是没有辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c260">明星們的聲譽即明星們的牢獄（下） <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 諸家博</p>
<p>散蘇畢茨（Jasu　Pitts）說：「馮史都漢以爲我能表演，但是許多人第一次在銀幕看見了我，就笑了起來。那個笑就在我的四周建築起高厚的牆垣來，使我無法可以逃避。從此以後，我就成了我一切面部和手的表情的俘虜了。這非但在我事業上爲然，就是在我平日私生活之中，亦都受了一種無形的限制。我從來没有参加過任何宴會。我四年之中，從來没有買過一件夜禮服。因爲我已經有了「不好看」的名譽。他們亦都不來請我参加宴會了。我亦因爲要避免他們苛酷的批評眼光，所以情願在家裏，陪陪小陔子玩玩。小孩子是不拿苛刻的眼光來批評我的。他們不覺得我不好看，而祇覺得我好看。他們從來不笑我，祇和我共同的笑着。</p>
<p>莫雷泰嘉寳（Greta　Garbo）亦是深深被禁錮在神秘的在獄中的一個囚徒。她那種神秘的聲譽所造成的墻壁，比之古時候的城堡還要堅固。要是嘉寳一擺脫她的鎖鏈，而想從這牢獄中逃走的話，四面一定會軍號齊鳴，守兵四起，重重將牠包圍了起來，使她無法可逃的。因此她便不得不深居簡出，除了自己的攝影塲之外，不得隨便跑到别的攝影塲，和别的同事們閒談，不得任意和人談笑戲謔，並不得好萊鳱的大街信步遊行。</p>
<p>愛琳鄧說：「我亦是一個職業思想或職業聲譽的俘虜。他們都認我是一個十全女子，好像聽到一句不道德的話，都會暈倒，或是遇到了喝酒的人就要拿乎帕掩住鼻子似的。其實我時常想聽聽人家講的笑話，讓我亦捧腹大笑一下子。我在相當的塲合，亦能喝杯鷄尾酒。但是我太被這種「好名聲」所累了。」和愛琳鄧的處境，正是一個相反的，就是那葫蘆式身體的梅維絲（Mae　West）。好的聲譽，完全是一位蕩婦的聲譽，因爲她在銀幕上善長於表演淫蕩女子。久而久之，她的牢獄已經造成，而不可打破了。其實好並不喝酒，也不吸烟，亦不参加夜宴會。她是一個規矩的家庭婦女。當然，她决不是像在銀幕上所見的。常常勾引男子，到她家裏去坐坐的。</p>
<p>恐怕被監禁得最嚴的，要算是珍妮蓋諾（Janet　Gaynor）了。她的牢獄，恐怕永遠没有逃走的機會了。有一次有一位女記者訪問珍妮。那時珍妮剛和李德爾配克結婚未久。她看見了那位記者，在談話之中，很高興地說她很想生一個孩子。那位記者以爲那是極平常的事，每個賢良的妻子嫁了男人之後，總會想生個小娃娃的。想不到那位記者回到家之後，她就接到了電影公司的電話，要求她不要把珍妮關於生孩子的話登在報上。那位記者說，女人生孩子，極普通的事，爲什麽連那種希望，都不准在報上發表呢？可是公司裏的人說：「那不興。要是你登了那些話，她的名譽就完了。她永久是一個小姑娘。她是青春。她是甜密。她是光榮。她不得和人生的一切接觸的。生孩子的事，尤其相差不遠了！」最近，外面谣傳着，說珍妮忽然和一位有婦之男子發生了愛情。大家驚慌失措的耳語着，好像那話要是證實了的話，好萊塢就會天崩地坼似的。</p>
<p>愛麗絲懷德（Slice　White）有一天悽然地說道：「我是個囚徒，恐怕是無期徒刑吧！我永遠被監禁在那「開金鑛」，（即女子惟利是圖之謂）的惡名之下，牢不可拔了。眞奇怪極了。但是我却是個治家的能人，我是近曾在五百個婦人之前，表演過我烹調的能力。我能織阿富汗式的絨衣。我能製意大利式的麵。我能蒸可可蛋糕，比誰都好。我知道節省金錢。我按時到攝影塲，從來不遲誤。我亦不和男同事有往來。但是，在世界上的人看起來，我還是一個煊赫得不可嚮邇的黄髮的危險女子而已。</p>
<p>以上的都是一般的囚徒，范侖鐵諾終身做了Aheilr。愛琳鄧是個永世不變的十全女子。珍妮蓋諾是個永不長大的小妹妹。梅維絲是個無法救濟的妖婦。愛麗絲懷德是個貪財而不要名譽的女子。嘉寳永遠是一個單身走路的人。他們每一個人單獨的監禁在一間屋子裏。隔離着，使他們的特點，永遠没有混合攙雜的可能！（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Line　Up_國泰</p>
<p>從各方面來說，我們不能給予這一影片以較高的評價，因爲這不過是一部平凡的偵探影片而已。</p>
<p>不過，這裏所探取的題材，却是比較新鮮的，劇作者寓一羣偷衣裳的賊，連帶了一個女人，而這一個女人和偵探戀愛起來了。結果賊黨被破案了，而女人和偵探也甜蜜的旅行去了。故事的平庸化，於此可見一班。</p>
<p>導演的手法，有着相當明快的調子，進行得也很順利。特别是後面的那一段，當二偵探搜查衣裳店，還没有破獲秘密機關的時候，由於適當的剪接，那種緊張而又發噱的氣氛，確是很好的。</p>
<p>演員的演技，如個另的檢討起來，都没有特殊可取之處，不過幾個主要的，都還能平均發展，至少還能將平凡的戲平凡的演了出來。</p>
<p>就是這麽的，　　的是平凡，如此而已。</p>
<h3 id="c262">影事隨筆 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 隠仕</p>
<p>一，中國所缺少的幾種影片。</p>
<p>顯然的：中國的電影自從經過了「九一八」，「一二八」這兩個非常事變之後，因爲民族意識的高漲，電影企業自身的醒覺，是有了很顯然的進步，至少—那些神怪武俠有害民族思想的影片，已在影壇上絶跡了。</p>
<p>可是目前的中國電影雖已有了顯著的進步。但在質的一方面上講，還缺少好幾種影片，如社會教育片，兒童教育片，科學片，生理片，以戰事作背景灌輸民衆軍事常識的影片……無疑的，上列的幾種影片在目前是非常的需要，然而我們現在還没有聽見有一個公司將攝製上述影片的消息。這眞是一個非常可憾的事！</p>
<p>二，希望電影公會早日實現</p>
<p>最近電影界有這樣一個傳說，某某等八個公司擬組織一電影同業公會，規定每一個月中開一次或兩次團體會議，共同商討電影藝術進行的步驟，另一方面又可以解釋公司對公司的有所誤會。的確：在這各公司互相仇視傾紥内爭：外國電影界加緊向中國電影陣地侵略的時候，電影同業公會的産生，是最迫切需要的。</p>
<p>三，明星們的體格問題</p>
<p>中國電影明星们（包括男明星與女明星在一起）身體的不健康，這確是一個無可諱言的事實，除了少數肯運動者的例外。</p>
<p>我們知道有健康的身體，才有健全的事業，而且幹電影的工作，是比較幹其他的工作更來得容易損害身體。日與夜的不分，熱與冷的不調和，工作時間的漫無限止，假如你没有健康的身體來與他抵抗，終久，你的身體將更孱弱而多病。你偉大的前程也就葬送在孱弱多病的身體裏了。</p>
<p>中國的電影明星們，希望你們在工作以後的時間不要迷戀在那些有損金錢與身體的回力球塲或跳舞塲裏吧。應當利用這空餘的時間來努力運動，充實你們身體的健康，瞧！好萊塢每個明星的身體都很健康的原因，便是他們肯運動所得到的報酬啊！</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>斐羅聽了賽克斯的話，信以爲眞的就帶了他去找班卓。賽克斯走進了車站，忽然想要打一個電報給紐約報館，於是就和斐羅商量着，在電報房裏等他們，而呌另外兩個强盜去尋班卓去。這裏賽克斯將從地上搬過一部打字機，將一張紙塞了進去，的的打打地作着通訊稿子，報告班卓一班强盜克復拉康西報興的眞實情形。正在這個時候，班卓和他的乎下人湯麥斯和沃提斯等，正在一家搶刦一空的店舖裏。他們在那裏，捉到了七個女人，班卓正在一個一個的檢騐着。他嬉皮笑臉的打量着她們，而她們亦都一個一個都想將班卓的歡心，儘着讓他調戲。不過班卓調戲到第五個女子的時候，那女子竟露着厭惡的神氣。班卓問她呌什麽名字。她說呌露茜姐。班卓道：「怎麽回事呀？你怕我嗎你不用怕。我是很忠厚的。」他說着，將乎去拿她粉臉擰了一把。不意那女子，竟怒從胆邊生，伸乎拍撻一下子，將班卓打了一記耳光。班卓喊道：「哦，好，湯麥斯，找就要這個。露苦妲，跟我來。你不是要惹我發火嗎？」他使勁將她的乎一拉，就將她抱在懷裏了，露茜妲還是一不作，二不休的拍撻拍撻的打着他的嘴巴。湯麥斯走了過來，將她輕輕抱了起來。露茜妲還喊道：「你既要我，你該娶我。我是不跟竊光蛋的！」正在這個當兒，沃提斯走到班卓的面前，報告說斐羅正找他，在車站的電報房裏，有一個人要見他哩。班卓就吩咐沃提斯去帮湯麥斯的忙。露茜妲還在喊着班卓：「你既要我，非娶我不與！」班卓回頭叱了一聲：「放屁！」就走開了。</p>
<p>班卓走進了電報房，斐羅對着正在打字的賽克斯向班卓點着頭。班卓走到賽克斯的背後，看着他打字。這時那紙上寫的是：「拉康西板興，墨西哥，八月十五日電。匪軍今日由亡命班卓維拉率領，突然侵入此處，匪黨到後，四出焚略，全境洗刦一空。姦淫殺戮之惨，暗無天日……」賽克斯正會着，忽然抬起頭來，看見了一個臃腫不靈的醜漢，就問道：「你是班卓維拉嗎？」班卓維拉道：「是的。」賽克斯連忙將乎掩住了那打字機上的紙喊道：「不要看，不要看。我還要重寫哩」。班卓伸出一個粗而且肥的指頭，指着那張紙上的一個字道「這是我的名字嗎？唔，我的名字，班卓維拉？還說些什麽？」賽克斯聽了，歎了一口安心的氣道：「怎麽？你不認識字的嗎？上面所說的，大概是報告你的勇敢的弟兄們，怎樣克服中央軍隊，以及你的個人方面的天才等等。」班卓道：「這是你寫到美國去的嗎？」賽克斯道：「當然，每天早晨有六百萬人不看我的通訊，就吃不下早餐哩」。班卓片己搔着頭道：「這太短了。你不多寫些？」賽克斯聽了高興起來道：「哦，要是你能設法，使你手下的弟兄們到外面去散散步，我的腦筋就可以更安心工作了。」班卓聽了，立即吩咐大家都到外面去。賽克斯又說道：「我没有酒喝，我寫不好。那個人將我的酒搶去了。」班卓於是又立即將那瓶酒搶了回來，交給了賽克斯然後說道：「你告訴美國人，班卓維拉是不怕死的」。（未完）</p>

<p>To Cooperatively Suppress Bandits When Encountered</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits who escaped from Wu Du Cliff have crossed the Great Wall at Jiufeng Pass and entered the border area of the puppet state of Rehe Province. They are actively replenishing firearms and ammunition, intending to seize an opportunity to re-enter the Great Wall and cause disturbance. The provincial government believes that the bandit disturbances in Zunhua, Ji County, Yutian, and three other counties are backed by an underlying cause and fears that they will become a festering sore. Now, the militia and police forces of Qian’an, Zunhua, Fengrun, Yutian, and Ji County are implementing joint defense. When bandit gangs appear, they will cooperate to suppress them regardless of jurisdictional boundaries until they are eradicated. (2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 9th Squadron of the War Zone Security Force, under the command of Qi Baokun, has been ordered by Battalion Commander Wang Zhanyuan to station at the border area between Ji and Zunhua counties and in Malanyu Town to guard against bandits.

<h3 id="e6">Legislative Yuan Continues Discussion of the Draft Constitution <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Passes the Second Half of the National Assembly Chapter</p>
<h3 id="e7">Decision Made for the President to be Elected by the Assembly <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 70th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, with 72 members present. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. The meeting reviewed Article 32 of the third chapter of the Draft Constitution, the Powers of the National Assembly. The Chairman proposed discussing the principles first: (1) Should the National Assembly Committee be abolished? (2) Should the President be directly elected by the people or by the National Assembly? (3) What should be the method for selecting the heads of the Control, Judicial, and Examination Yuan? On the first point, there was unanimous agreement to abolish the National Assembly Committee. On the second point, the method for electing the President, a heated debate arose. First, Lin Bin, the original reviewing committee member, reported on the results of the Friday discussion. Cheng Zhonghang stated that if the President is directly elected by the people, then the legislative members should also be elected in the same manner. The people of the entire country would be busy with elections all year round and would not have time for anything else. Therefore, he advocated that election by the National Assembly would be more appropriate. Chen Ruxuan said that based on the facts, since the founding of the Republic, there have been two presidential elections, both of which resulted in national chaos. This is the drawback of congressional elections. Electing the President by the National Assembly again would likely repeat the same mistakes. Furthermore, the National Assembly is convened once every two years, with each session lasting one month, at most extended by one month. If the President is to be elected, they will be busy with negotiations all day long, and will not have time to exercise other political powers. On the contrary, if there is direct election by the people, although there may be ambition, attempts to emulate Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun by using force or bribery would be difficult to implement among the people of the entire nation. Therefore, direct election is more appropriate. Yang Gongda said that the people lack sufficient knowledge, how can they elect the President? Furthermore, the Draft Constitution stipulates that active military personnel cannot be elected President, so the mistakes of Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun can be avoided. Shi Weihuan said that electing the President is the best form of national education, which can arouse the people's political interest and cultivate a sense of patriotism. Moreover, the President is elected by all the people, which can enhance his authority. Therefore, direct election is more meaningful. Gu Zhenggang said that election by the National Assembly does not violate the teachings of Sun Yat-sen. If there is direct election by the people, it will be easier for the provinces to be manipulated and will not be able to express public opinion. Moreover, the powers of the National Assembly have been reduced. If the President is directly elected by the people, then the National Assembly will have nothing to do. Cheng Zhonghang said that national education can be strengthened through political tutelage. Giving the power of election to the people is too dangerous. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, the provinces also presented petitions urging him to do so, which shows that direct election cannot avoid drawbacks. Wu Shangying said that at present, there are domestic troubles and foreign invasions, and four provinces have not been recovered. There are Red bandits causing disturbances within the country. If there is direct election by the people, how will the people in the four provinces and the bandit-controlled areas be able to elect? Zhu Hezhong said that the constitution is the fundamental law and should be a plan for the next hundred years. How can there be a situation where the people in the four provinces and the bandit-controlled areas cannot elect for a hundred years? Gu Zhenggang said that the constitution is not something that cannot be amended after being in effect for a hundred years. Moreover, China is in a process of construction and evolution, and the constitution will be amended from time to time. Lou Tongsun said that the true nature of the current constitution can be said to be a constitution for national crisis. It is most practical to regulate the central political system and the National Assembly, and there is no need to quibble about whether the President is directly elected by the people or not. Liang Hancao said that in the current situation, it is difficult to solicit genuine public opinion. The reasons stated by Shi and Chen are solid and cannot be broken, but maintaining the original proposal is also harmless. If the National Assembly representatives are truly elected by the people, they will definitely be able to represent their intentions in electing the President. Moreover, the constitution can be amended. In the future, as the people's knowledge increases, if they feel that direct election is necessary, they can amend the constitution. Ma Chaojun said that if the representatives are bribed, the people have the inherent right to recall them. Li Zhonggong said that since the National Assembly representatives exercise four powers and are given the powers of initiative, referendum, and recall, why are they not given the power of election? Furthermore, if the President is directly elected by the people, he should also be recalled by the people, which would increase the difficulty. Sun Ke said that both sides have reasons, but we cannot intentionally regard the National Assembly as an organ for bribery and trading. If the people can truly exercise their political power, the representatives will not be able to violate the law even if they want to. Wei Tingsheng and Chen Changheng spoke, and a vote was taken. Only 17 votes were in favor of direct election of the President by the people, and it was not passed. Subsequently, the methods for selecting the heads of the Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan were discussed. It was decided that the head of the Control Yuan would be elected by the National Assembly, and the heads of the Judicial and Examination Yuan would be appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The meeting adjourned at noon. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM on the 2nd, the Legislative Yuan continued its plenary session to discuss the Powers of the National Assembly in Article 32 of the Draft Constitution. Item 1: "Elect the President, Vice President, President of the Legislative Yuan, President of the Control Yuan, Legislative Members, and Control Members." Item 2: "Recall the President, Vice President, Presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan, Legislative Members, and Control Members." The entire body passed both items on the second reading without dissent. Item 2: "Initiate Legislative Principles." Hu Xuanming proposed changing it to "Initiate Laws." Fu Bingchang advocated maintaining the original proposal. Lv Zhiyi supported Hu's proposal. Chen Changheng proposed merging Items 3 and 4. Jiao Tang seconded the proposal. The Chairman put it to a vote of the Assembly. The result was in favor of changing Item 3 to "Initiate Laws" and Item 4 remained as "Referendum on Laws" as in the original draft, passed by a majority. Item 5: "Resolve Impeachments by the Control Yuan Against the President, Vice President, Presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan." Chen Ruxuan said that resolving impeachments is not the power of the National Assembly and should be executed by a political power organ. Liu Guanxun advocated deleting this item because it is already stipulated in Article 108. The Chairman then explained that the Control Yuan must first review impeachments against the President, Vice President, and heads of the various Yuan, then decide whether or not to punish them, and finally decide on execution. This article is not clearly defined and can be deleted. Luo Ding and others also advocated for deletion. The entire body passed it without dissent. Item 6: "Receive Reports from the President and the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan." Item 7: "Handle Matters Submitted by the President and the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan for Resolution." Lv Zhiyi believed that Items 6 and 7 were not important and advocated for their deletion. The majority agreed and passed them. Sun Ke said that amending the constitution is the most important task of political power, and it was also explained in the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, so he advocated adding Item 5: "Amend the Constitution." The entire body passed it without dissent. The original Item 8, "Other Powers Granted by the Constitution," was changed to Item 6, without dissent and passed. Article 33: "National Assembly Representatives shall not exercise their powers during the recess of the National Assembly, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution." Lou Tongsun said that the National Assembly Committee has been abolished and Article 32 has been defined for the powers of the Assembly, this article should be deleted. The entire body passed it without dissent. Article 34: "National Assembly Representatives shall not be held responsible to the outside world for their speeches and votes during meetings," and Article 35: "National Assembly Representatives shall not be arrested or detained during the session without the permission of the National Assembly, except in cases of being caught in the act." Both articles were passed by the entire body without dissent, only to be renamed Article 33 and Article 34 respectively. Furthermore, Articles 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 of the original draft were completely deleted due to the abolition of the National Assembly Committee, and Article 41, "The organization of the National Assembly and the election of National Assembly Representatives shall be determined by law," was changed to Article 35. Chen Changheng advocated adding the words "or recall" under the word "election." The entire body agreed, and the second reading was passed. By this time, it was 5:00 PM, and the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled the continuation of the discussion for 2:30 PM on the 3rd. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju, accompanied by Ge Guangting, Zhang Weicun, Wang Fangting, and others, departed for Beiping by special train at 11:30 AM. Before his departure, Han stated that he would meet with Huang, attend the Political Consolidation Committee, and had no proposals. He planned to return to Jinan in about a week. Training the Lian Zhuang Hui (village self-defense association) requires first banning opium, otherwise there will be no able-bodied men in the villages and they will not be able to defend themselves. He has ordered the secretariat to use vernacular proclamations to inform the public. Han's train passed Yucheng at noon and Dezhou at 2:30 PM. He got off the train at both locations to inspect the police and soldiers' weapons and encouraged them to prohibit drugs. He said that anyone who seizes ten taels of opium will be rewarded with one hundred yuan, and one hundred taels will be rewarded with one thousand yuan. Resisters will be shot. He telegraphed a report to Jinan and instructed the Magistrate of De County to seriously train the Lian Zhuang Hui. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Han Fuju is travelling to meet Huang Fu. His special train will pass through Tianjin at 9:30 PM tonight and go directly to Beiping. Yu Xuezhong, however, will wait until the 6th when the Political Consolidation Committee convenes its congress, citing physical discomfort. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Han Fuju's special train is delayed until 4:30 AM on the 3rd. The original departure was set for 9:30 PM because the train was slightly delayed in Botou.

<p>P蒙政委會闢謠&gt; [Mongolian Political Committee Denies Rumors]</p>
<p>De Wang's Secretary-General Has Returned to the Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Political Committee telegraphed to Director Wu of the Mongolian Affairs Office on the 29th, stating that the committee is in its initial stage of establishment and difficulties are inevitable. After several months, it seems to have overcome obstacles and entered a smooth path. It is expected to convene meetings of various committees to report on the progress of the committee's work in the past six months and to discuss strategies for promoting committee affairs. However, there are rumors discussing the issue of survival or abolition. It is not known where these rumors originate. As for the news that Li Shouxin's troops have entered Xilin Gol League, the committee has not yet heard of it. The news of De Wang's independence is even more unfounded. At a time when the relationship between Mongolia and the Central Government is becoming increasingly close, it is inappropriate to spread such rumors, which are disturbing. It is hoped that everyone will make a realistic explanation to avoid misunderstandings. It is also reported that De Wang's Secretary-General has already returned to the committee. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Observations on the Eastern European Locarno Treaty by Jing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Geneva Disarmament Conference has failed. Diplomatic meetings within the League of Nations are increasingly approaching a stalemate. Britain is unwilling to delve deeply into the whirlpool of continental disputes. France is exerting its full strength to maintain the status quo of its territory. However, the German resistance movement has not diminished in the slightest. Italy's ambition to dominate Central Europe remains unfulfilled, causing unsettling currents to surge. The infighting and covert struggles among nations are even more intense than on the eve of the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. At the time of the assassination of Austrian former Chancellor Dollfuss, an armed conflict between Italy and Germany was on the verge of erupting. At that moment, crises loomed, and France and the Danube countries were all in imminent danger of being swept into the chaotic tide, causing the turmoil of Europe to reappear. Fortunately, Germany's attitude was cautious, and France was unwilling to act rashly. A flame was extinguished. However, the fundamental causes of the disaster still exist. For example, the political situation in Austria is not yet stable. Once triggered, it could still bring disaster to the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>However, the roots of the Central European disaster are commonly known to the world. Major powers such as Britain, France, Italy, and Germany still know how to prevent it. Unless absolutely necessary, they will not resort to armed conflict. Therefore, the disaster is obvious, and its harm may be relatively small. The situation in Eastern Europe is different. Before the compromise between Germany and Poland, Poland followed France's lead. It was easier to implement France's main goal of maintaining the status quo. However, after the establishment of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in January of this year, the northeastern corner of the Versailles system suddenly disintegrated. France was deeply concerned that the rapprochement between Germany and Poland would lead to the loss of its hegemony, and it was already uneasy. If Germany rises again, the danger will be even greater. Therefore, Barthou sought advice in Warsaw to investigate the true intentions of the Polish authorities in preparation for future responses. We know that Poland's understanding with Germany may not have the active intention of destroying the Treaty of Versailles. Its focus is likely on the Ukrainian plains. As for Germany's goals, they are nothing more than wanting to spread its wings in Eastern Europe. The British Empire is resisting on the sea, France is a deadly enemy in Western Europe, and Italy is watching Central Europe, not allowing others to overstep the mark. The last resort is to obtain Poland's consent, pass through East Prussia, cross the two small countries on the Baltic coast, and march eastward to seek development on the continent, to invade the Soviet Union, which is envied by the international community.</p>
<p>Therefore, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have become the center of gravity of the Eastern European situation, the arena for the diplomatic competition of Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. Its impact on the overall European situation is very significant. As the situation in Eastern Europe gradually became tense, Germany's plan to break through diplomatic isolation became more active. Leaving aside other things, the budget for diplomatic propaganda alone this year is 256 million francs. No other country can match this. (Italy's is 119 million francs, France's is 71 million francs, and Britain's is only 69 million francs.) Judging from this, Germany's efforts in diplomacy are not limited to mere negotiations. Its movement for understanding with the people of other countries is also not lax. It can be seen that what it is most vigilant about is not only France but also the Soviet Union, which holds a corner of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, France and the Soviet Union, countries with significant differences in interests, conflicting systems, and unresolved debt disputes, can actually compromise with each other, moving from understanding to friendship, and from friendship to jointly guaranteeing European security. France is making every effort to bring the Soviet Union into the League of Nations and wants to sign the Eastern Locarno Treaty. Is there no reason for this? Although the Soviet Union's position is different from France's, it shares the same desire to maintain peace. It also strives to restrain Germany's unrestrained behavior at any time and place, preventing it from expanding excessively and endangering European security, which is similar to the French mindset. Therefore, France and the Soviet Union are cooperating to seek a treaty on Eastern European security, and the world is spreading rumors that it has the implication of a military alliance. It is not without reason. As for the Soviet Union's intention, whether it wants to use the stability of Western Europe to curb Japan's fierce flames, it is still beyond our ability to predict.</p>
<p>The US Response to Us: We Will No Longer Purchase Silver in the Future</p>
<h3 id="e10">Roosevelt's Meeting with the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury Indicates No Change in Existing Silver Policy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today met with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, and Morgenthau's advisor, Laughlin Currie. It is heard that a response to China's inquiry about silver will be issued soon. Hull indicated that the response could be sent immediately, but it still required the President's consultation to determine the final form. Hull also said that China's inquiry was of an interrogative nature, not a protest. There is no news about the content of the response, but the Secretary of the Treasury stated that the response may not provide guarantees regarding China's concern about the excessive increase in global silver prices. He also stated that there has been no change in the United States' silver policy. Other than that, the Secretary of the Treasury declined to comment, but said that the Treasury Department's silver purchases since the promulgation of the Silver Nationalization Act are not far from the limit. The Treasury Department has purchased 90,969,584 ounces of silver, and will probably no longer purchase more. In addition, the Treasury Department has purchased 13,601,000 ounces of raw silver at a price of US$0.645 per ounce. (1st National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, since the announcement of silver nationalization on August 9, the US Treasury Department has successively purchased 90,969,584 new ounces of silver, approximately 2,830 tons. The Chinese government protested to the United States because the United States' purchase of silver was sufficient to harm China's finances and commerce. Regarding this matter, President Roosevelt has held a long meeting with Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. Morgenthau stated that the United States has not changed its policy of purchasing silver, but the government will not respond to the Chinese government's inquiry until a more thorough study of the issue is made.

<h3 id="e12">Sharp Drop in the Price of the Pound Sterling <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Talks Between Britain and the United States Continue</p>
<p>(London) Due to the continued pressure on the pound sterling, the price of gold has reached a new high of 142 shillings and 2.5 pence. The gold bloc was previously affected by the panic in Belgium, but its credit has now been fully restored. US commerce has recently experienced a turning point, so the demand for gold dollars is greater than last year. In addition, Roosevelt's speech, which some say is a sign that the dollar will not be further devalued, has led speculators to rush to cover their positions, resulting in even greater demand for gold dollars. Rumors are rampant in the market, but well-informed sources mostly do not believe them. Some say that talks on a stable exchange rate between the dollar and the pound sterling are currently underway, and others say that Britain is currently using its equalization fund to buy dollars in order to maintain the price of one pound sterling at US$4.86. It is generally believed that this price is highly agreeable to the British and American authorities. It does not seem difficult for Britain to use its equalization fund to prevent the pound sterling from falling below this price, but it will be more difficult to prevent the pound sterling from rising excessively in the future, because the seasonal demand for the pound sterling is approaching, and France's influx of gold into London may cause political and financial difficulties, so the demand for the pound sterling seems to be even greater.

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Seligman, a member of the British industrial inspection team currently touring Tokyo, accompanied by Mr. Bearsted, a major British securities dealer, visited the Ministry of Finance on the 2nd and met with Vice-Minister Tsushima. It is said that for the sake of Anglo-Japanese friendship, the actual situation of Japan's economy and finance should be fully explained. Vice-Minister Tsushima explained in detail the recent financial situation of Japan, especially the revenue and expenditure for the 9th year of Showa. Regarding the issuance of public bonds, due to natural revenue increases in the 8th year of Showa, the total amount of planned issuance was reduced by 160 million yen. Mr. Seligman praised Japan's financial policy very much and said that recently the prices of domestic Japanese public bonds and foreign currency public bonds are quite comparable. This is due to external reasons. Japan's foreign currency public bonds are more numerous than those held by the Japanese people and are in a very solid state. They talked for about two hours before taking their leave. (2nd Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) The chairman of the National Aeronautic Association, former Senator Bingham, wrote to the Federal Aviation Commission today, advocating the early establishment of scheduled air service across the Pacific Ocean. He also said that the government should subsidize the company that operates this air service. Bingham served as a flight officer during the war and has been engaged in promoting British commercial aviation for many years. According to his plan, large airships, rather than airplanes, would cross the ocean. Part of his plan is based on the aviation methods for crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It is not yet known what the commission will do with this proposal, but it is said that it will be studied at length. (1st National News Agency)</p>

He will leave for Chicago tomorrow. During a welcome meeting for Cai last night, he said to the audience that China can only be preserved after the Chinese army drives the Japanese out of the country. Public opinion is the strongest force in condemning Japanese land invasion, but since Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty and disregarded the League of Nations, China must adopt more severe methods than public opinion in its struggle to seek world peace in order to maintain peace.

<p>160,000 Booklets Distributed Everywhere, Advocating Reform of the Capitalist System, Military Interference in Politics Makes All Parties Feel Serious Again</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The booklet "The True Meaning of National Defense and the Promotion of its Strengthening" printed by the Ministry of the Army has been distributed to all parties to promote national awareness of the extraordinary situation. The content of the booklet not only promotes the issue of strengthening national defense, but also mentions economic issues, expressing the opinion that major reforms should be made to the capitalist system. All parties have been greatly shocked by the military's expression of opinions on domestic political issues. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties, due to the seriousness of the incident, did not dare to criticize it and plan to consider countermeasures after studying the content. The government and the House of Peers also attach importance to this issue, but it is not yet clear for what purpose the army issued such a booklet and whether Minister of the Army Hayashi approved its issuance. When the upcoming temporary parliament opens, it will inevitably become a political issue, and its future is quite worthy of attention. (2nd Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 3:00 PM today, the Minseito Party held a cadre meeting at its headquarters. President Wakatsuki and others attended. They stated the following strong opinions regarding the issue of the army's booklet:</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi seems to know about the booklet published by the army, but there are indeed disagreements. It is worth noting how Prime Minister Okada will handle it. It seems inappropriate for the army to publish guiding opinions on social and economic policies in an orderly country. If the proposal is implemented, what will the state of the country be? The army should make a statement to the people so that the attitude of the military causing a social revolution cannot be greatly discussed in this parliament. (2nd Dempo News Agency)</p>

<p>Equal Emphasis on Rural and Urban Economies</p>
<p>Establish National and Moral Concepts</p>
<p>Deep Concern That Air Force Strength is No Match for Neighboring Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to clarify the content of the national policy it holds to the world, the army printed 160,000 booklets entitled "The True Meaning of National Defense and its Strengthening," which were publicly released yesterday. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Defense and Domestic Issues: A part of the people enjoys unearned income, while the majority suffers hardships, leading to class antagonism. This cannot be overlooked in national defense. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an economic structure that adapts to the ideal of the imperial country as a whole. The poverty of rural areas for various reasons can be attributed to the opposition between urban and rural areas. Therefore, from the perspective of mutual dependence and the coexistence and co-prosperity of the people, the hard work of the rural areas themselves should reflect the city and echo it, so as to seek true regeneration.</p>
<p>(2) National Defense and Thought: It is necessary to establish firm national and moral concepts, strive to eliminate extreme internationalism and individualism, promote the nation's unique culture, and prevent uncritical absorption of Western culture.</p>
<p>(3) National Defense and Military Force: The army with the minimum military equipment required for passive national defense, after the Manchurian Incident, the area for maintaining security has gradually expanded. Therefore, even from the perspective of passive significance, the enrichment of military strength and equipment is extremely important. The air force strength of neighboring countries has reached more than three times that of Japan, so with the current strength, it is difficult to expect the safety of national defense.</p>
<p>(4) National Defense and Economy: Based on the moral economic concept based on the ideal of nation-building, increase the well-being of the entire people, promote the activities of the entire people, make them see that their hard work gets what it deserves, and stabilize the lives of the masses. If it does not violate the requirements of the country, it should satisfy its personal entrepreneurial desire, so as to be a corrective measure for the current economic structure.</p>
<p>(5) The Improvement of Financial Institutions and Tax System: Since the scope of the war economy is wide, it should be studied from peacetime. (2nd Dempo News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e22">The President of the Japanese Bureau of Manchurian Affairs Will Be Held Concurrently by the Minister of the Army <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Government and the Military Seem to Have Reached a Consensus</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding whether the president of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs should be appointed by a military officer or a civil official, the army and the government have become opposing forces on this issue. As a result of recent negotiations, the president will be held concurrently by the Minister of the Army, and the deputy director will also be a military officer. The opinions are generally in a pattern of consensus. (2nd Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are various opinions on the issue of the president of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs. Minister of the Army Hayashi, Vice-Minister Hashimoto, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata, and other top leaders only advocate that the president or vice-director should be appointed by a military officer based on the person's position. There is no other advocacy. However, since the government has revealed its intention to have Minister of the Army Hayashi concurrently serve as president, the issue of whether it is more convenient for a civil official or a military officer to serve as president should be studied. Regarding the army's intention to have the Minister of the Army concurrently serve, it is as follows: (1) All parties hope that Minister of the Army Hayashi will serve concurrently. (2) Opening the precedent of the Minister of the Army serving concurrently, other state ministers will inevitably serve concurrently in the future, but at this time, the Minister of the Army has the right to speak, and the deputy director must be appointed by a military officer. Therefore, there are many in the army who advocate that Minister of the Army Hayashi should serve concurrently. It will be decided after Minister of the Army Hayashi, who is currently inspecting the military situation and the wind disaster in the west, returns to Beijing. Since various parties have opposed the appointment of a major general or lieutenant general other than Hayashi as president, the army has not considered this. (2nd Dempo News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Japanese Army Advocates Establishing a Large Intelligence Agency <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The National Policy Council is Likely to be Realized</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army deeply feels that the establishment of an intelligence agency with national defense and national policy as important departments is imminent. It plans to propose to the government at an opportune time. The specific method is to unify the Military Investigation Department of the Army, the Military Popularization Department of the Navy, and the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs into a large agency, or to become an independent ministry, or to have a director of the ministerial level directly under the cabinet and to have many civilian experts participate. (2nd Dempo News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are two major difficulties in the establishment of the National Policy Council, internal and external, and the hope of realization is very small. However, as a result of the efforts of Minister of Railways Uchida and Minister of Communications Tokonami, the opinions of all cabinet members are unanimously in favor, so there is a gradual possibility of realization. Minister of Railways Uchida's opinion is to recruit first-class figures as members to review various issues such as industry, economy, administration, and finance. It can be realized approximately after the closing of the temporary parliament. (2nd Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>Riga A traveler who returned from Moscow spoke about the economic situation in the Soviet Union, saying briefly that Soviet state-owned enterprises are experiencing financial difficulties and struggling desperately. Civil servants and employees have not been paid for months. In September of this year, the government requisitioned all valuable ornaments and gems from stores in Moscow. The Soviet government is preparing to thoroughly reform internal commerce. The prices of gold rubles and paper rubles originally had distinctions, but now they are using a compromise rate to make the two converge. Although this reform cannot be immediately regarded as an increase in the price of paper rubles, it can be regarded as a stabilization policy. Various wages are benefiting from it, but once the purchasing power of wage earners increases, after a certain period of time, all prices will inevitably rise significantly and exceed today's prices. According to the same source, the government is gradually feeling difficulties in the funds required to implement the second five-year plan. There seems to be no doubt about this, so it is generally speculated that the Soviet government will strive to borrow from foreign countries. (1st Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>The Catholic Agrarian Party Holds the Key to the Overall Situation</p>
<p>The Socialist Party Has a Conspiracy to Launch a Major Uprising</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish government was laughed to death today. When Prime Minister Samper stated various issues regarding Catalonia and the budget in Congress, members of the left and right wings laughed wildly to disrupt it. Afterwards, the leader of the Catholics rose to speak, and his criticism of the government was extremely激昂. So the Prime Minister asked other minority parties to express their opinions, but none responded. The government then adjourned to consider its position, and then announced its resignation. (1st Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid The turbulent political situation in Spain has prompted the resignation of the Samper cabinet, plunging the republican system into a precarious state. Since the discovery of a conspiracy by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to launch an uprising in September, the country has been in a state of alert. Now, it must either fully accept the provisions of the Constitution, or submit to the demands of the Socialist Party, the Industrial Revolution Party, and the Communist Party to immediately implement the labor dictatorship. The key to the overall situation is in the hands of the Catholic Agrarian Party. Its leader, Robles, has always been behind the scenes in mixed cabinets, and now he is using the situation to demand power from President Zamora. President is in this situation, but has to take extreme action to dissolve Congress. This is his second and last dissolution of Congress, because according to the Constitution, the President can only dissolve Congress twice during his term of office. Although the Socialist Party has the appearance of a major uprising, the President seems to be planning to have Lerroux, the leader of the Radical Party, organize a majority party government and invite the Catholic Agrarian Party to participate. Now he is waiting for a reply from Robles, who holds fascist views, to determine his course of action. Robles is tired of the rule of minority parties, or for the sake of gaining dictatorial power, he may change his entry into the Republican Party. Then many Catholics will abandon him, the imperialists will withdraw all their support, and the Socialist Party will be most saddened. Now it is rumored that if this move is realized, they will definitely stab the middle class in the chest.</p>
<p>According to reports, on September 19, the authorities detained a student and found a plan for a labor revolution in his arms, which planned to start by burning government offices and slaughtering those wearing uniforms. On the same day, a convertible car was found in the university city, full of military equipment and ammunition, proving that the anti-Catholic alliance was plotting to join hands with the revolutionary Socialist Party. Previously, a week ago, it was rumored that the Socialist Party was preparing a large number of military equipment and ammunition. Later, two Socialist Party congressmen were found at a certain seashore monitoring the transportation of 73 boxes of ammunition. On September 20, the government issued a notice to reassure the people, saying that there was no danger of revolution at present, but most of the people did not believe it, because they knew that several government offices had narrowly escaped being bombed, so they thought that the Socialist Party would sooner or later provoke a war.

<p>Madrid The Spanish cabinet resigned late last night because Robles, the leader of the right wing of the Acción Popular Party, attacked the cabinet's agricultural reform and Catalan autonomy policies in Congress. The general public admitted this morning that Prime Minister Samper's resignation was a serious problem facing President Zamora. The attack on the government in Congress was a sign that the Acción Popular Party believed that the time had come for the party to directly participate in politics. It is found that the party is the largest political party of minority parties in Congress. Now, if the cabinet resigns as approved by the President, or will organize a center-right majority party government, the Acción Popular Party will be able to gain one or two cabinet seats, but its leader is afraid that he will not be able to participate in person. Samper and his cabinet members had long known that the waves were about to rise and were overthrown by Congress, so some cabinet members advocated resigning first to avoid debate in Congress. The Acción Popular Party and the Radical Party cannot cooperate, so it is generally believed that it is difficult for the party and the Radical Party to form a cabinet together. It is not yet known whether the President is willing to trust a majority government, because after the establishment of a majority cabinet, it will cause a violent opposition from the left wing, and Lerroux, the leader of the Radical Party, recently expressed satisfaction with the Samper government, but Lerroux is also afraid that Samper will not be able to win in Congress, so it is better to have Samper resign early. The Radical Party may try to have Lerroux form a cabinet, but if the time is not yet ripe, it is also possible for Samper to reorganize the cabinet. The current problem must be decided by the President. If a center-right majority party government is organized, the Socialist Party and the left-wing Republican Party will withdraw from Congress, and a very difficult political situation will occur.

<p>Vienna – The Austrian National Socialist Party, led by Rienzi Lanz, a friend of German leader Hitler, has proposed a "National Action" plan to end the Austrian internal strife and is willing to cooperate with the government. It only requires the government to grant them equal status, and then they will be prepared to safeguard Austria's independence, participate in the reconstruction of Austria, and join the "Fatherland Front" to serve the country. It is reported that Prime Minister Kurt Schuschnigg agrees with this plan, but the Internal Guard and a portion of the former Christian Social Party are strongly opposed to any reconciliation.

<p>Trade Unions and Socialist Parties Seek Closer Ties</p>
<p>Mailey Criticized at the Pro-Communist Conference</p>
<p>(London) – It is widely expected that the Labor Conference in Southport will develop into a struggle between the Trade Union Congress and the Socialist League to control the Labour Party's policies. Yesterday, multiple meetings were held to try to bring the two sides closer together. The only agreements reached were that the House of Lords must be abolished and that owners should be compensated when private businesses are nationalized. However, opinions still differ greatly on the procedures for abolition and the extent of compensation. Trade unionists now say they are determined to make the Socialist League submit because the Labour Party relies heavily on trade union funding for elections, thus giving the trade unions a leading position. However, some predict that the League will break away from the Labour Party and promote Sir Stafford Cripps' socialist dictatorship throughout the country. Labour Party Chairman Smith stated in his opening speech that today's national coalition government is actually a lifeboat for a dilapidated industry. He also said that if the issue of choosing between well-organized selfishness and serving the public, the interests of a few and the happiness of all, state capitalism and socialism, is put before the people, he has no doubt that the whole country will respond to the call of socialism.

<p>(London) – The Labour Party began its conference in Southport today, with 800 delegates in attendance. Attendees protested the extreme nature of the committee chaired by Lord Mailey. Mailey said that the committee was not chaired by a communist party. During the debate, Executive Committee member Morrison pointed out that a certain statement by Mailey was a lie and said that Mailey knew it was untrue, but Mailey denied it. Subsequently, a motion was proposed that any Labour Party member who joined the organizations listed in the table should be punished. Labour MP Bevan immediately stood up to oppose it, and party member Shinwell claimed that Bevan's attitude was influenced by events to come. His words implied the recent engagement of Bevan with the former MP, Miss Lee, which caused an uproar throughout the venue. Eventually, Shinwell apologized, and order was restored. Bevan then proposed an amendment to the motion, but it was rejected by a majority. Afterwards, transport worker representative Bevin launched a scathing attack on Bevan, saying, "The praise you received in the London newspaper columns cannot be obtained at this conference." Shinwell also joined in the criticism. Miss Lee was also present, looking angry. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

The Daily News stated that the difficulties in the preliminary French-Italian negotiations before Barthou's visit to Rome are increasing because Mussolini's extravagant demands are difficult for France to accommodate. The French government has turned to Britain for help, intending to use the power of the British government to make Italy comply. The newspaper's Paris dispatch stated that the French Foreign Minister views the trip to Rome as very important but is deeply concerned about Mussolini's stubbornness and fears that he will demand a high price for naval equality and the Libyan border in North Africa. For this reason, he is full of hope that the British Foreign Office will mediate and complete the deal. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Cabinet Resigns for Reorganization</p>
<p>Likely a Prelude to a Change in Diplomatic Strategy</p>
<p>Bucharest – The Romanian government resigned today, and the King immediately ordered Prime Minister Tătărescu to form a new government. According to the Prime Minister, the government's action was taken because the monarch wanted to study the political situation before the parliament reconvened in order to find solutions to the existing problems. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Bucharest – King Carol has commissioned Prime Minister Tătărescu to form a new cabinet. According to the official gazette, the cabinet resigned to allow for a review of the political situation before the parliament convenes and to prepare for the King's visit abroad for consultation. The cabinet reshuffle has been brewing for a long time, but it has been delayed until now due to disagreements between the Prime Minister and Free Party leader Brătianu. Now that the Director of the Civil Service, Movilă, passed away a few days ago, the Prime Minister can implement the reshuffle according to his own wishes. Furthermore, sources close to the Prime Minister stated that he does not want to concurrently serve as Foreign Minister and does not want to recruit Free Party figures into the cabinet. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>Bucharest – The political upheaval in Romania was triggered by the resignation of Foreign Minister Titulescu. The Foreign Minister's passive stance was due to Prime Minister Tătărescu's unauthorized foreign actions without seeking his consent. It is now reported that the Prime Minister sent a long telegram to the Foreign Minister to persuade him to stay, and King Carol also spoke with the Foreign Minister on the phone. However, it is said that the Foreign Minister is determined to resign and does not want to do it again. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – Regarding the Romanian cabinet reshuffle, according to the local Havas News Agency representative, the initial resignation was actually by Foreign Minister Titulescu.

<p>Capital of Romania – After the cabinet tendered its resignation, the King still entrusted former Prime Minister Tătărescu to continue forming the cabinet. Tătărescu has gone to Sinaia to present the list of the new cabinet to the King. The members of the second Tătărescu cabinet are not much different from the members of his first cabinet, except that Foreign Minister Titulescu will resign. Although the government is extremely silent about Titulescu's attitude, political figures generally believe that Titulescu refuses to participate in the new cabinet and is very determined, and there is no way to reverse it. The new cabinet will appoint Sterian as Minister of Industry and Commerce, Prime Minister Tătărescu concurrently serves as Acting Foreign Minister, and De Juvara serves as Deputy Foreign Minister.

<p>Capital of Romania – Various "message newspapers" without political colors discuss the cabinet's resignation and are surprised that the political upheaval happened so suddenly. The opinions of the newspapers all believe that there are two political upheavals this time, one is the political upheaval within the Free Party, and the other is the political upheaval about Titulescu. Their severity is equal to each other, and they think that the new cabinet will be difficult to exist without Titulescu's participation. As for Prime Minister Tătărescu's intentions, the newspapers believe that he will retain some old cabinet members, and the rest will be sought from the Free Party's young members.

Titulescu had already resigned before the entire cabinet submitted its resignation, but the cabinet's resignation was definitely not affected by Titulescu's resignation.

<p>(Paris) – The Paris Echo and other French newspapers all attach great importance to the political upheaval in Romania, and they say that the resignation of Foreign Minister Titulescu was caused by relations with Germany. This is because Titulescu is recognized as the cornerstone of France's Central European and Balkan policies. Now that this cornerstone has collapsed, France feels a sense of shared adversity. The Paris Echo reported that Titulescu's resignation is causing peace-loving people to feel uneasy in this eventful time. The L'Action reported that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's bold actions in Geneva on the issue of minorities were the trigger for the Romanian cabinet upheaval. The Journal reported that the Romanian cabinet upheaval was caused by France's pro-Russian policy, and that the resignation of Foreign Minister Titulescu is the key to the separation between France and Romania. France has lost Romania after Poland. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The newspapers here unanimously expressed regret over the resignation of the Romanian cabinet, because Titulescu loves peace and is a friend of France. The newspapers all believe that the resignation of the Romanian cabinet was caused by foreign policy issues, especially some incidents in Geneva, and they want to hope that Titulescu will return to office soon. "L'Echosi Avoir" said, "The opinions of the member states of the League of Nations Council on the amendment of the clauses related to the rights of minorities in the Treaty of Versailles seem to be directly or indirectly related to the Romanian political upheaval." The Journal said, "The facts that happened in Geneva did not meet Titulescu's expectations, and the Soviet Union's entry into the League also reduced the effectiveness of the alliance between Poland and Romania. Titulescu's resignation may be an attempt to clarify the domestic political situation with a slam on the table, and it is not intentional to resign." The Paris Echo said, "Titulescu has made great contributions to Romania, but why does the Romanian authorities seem to not know how to be grateful to Titulescu? The answer to this question should be sought in two things: one is the political suspicion, and the other is the pressure exerted by Berlin, Rome, and Warsaw on Romania's internal affairs." The L'Ere Nouvelle reported that Titulescu strongly advocates getting close to the Soviet Union. Titulescu is the only one in Romania who advocates this policy, and he bravely advocates it. The newspaper also said that the enemies of the Little Entente are all happy to see Titulescu's departure. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Labor Unions are Very Pleased</p>
<p>(New York) – Wall Street, the financial center of the country, almost unanimously expressed disappointment with President Roosevelt's broadcast speech last night that the government is still determined to control industry and commerce, and they believe it is purely a political act. The President did not mention whether the dollar could be stabilized or whether the budget could be balanced, and they believed that this was a major mistake in this speech. A well-known broker said, "The business community hoped that the President would guarantee mutually linked efforts for recovery, but the President, like Washington's attitude recently, attacked Wall Street and the banking community." The banking community was even more indignant that the President said that they could not assist the government as the British banking community did. However, other aspects of the President's attitude toward private capital and labor-management relations were supported. Newspaper rhetoric was inconsistent. The labor side, according to the announcement of the annual meeting of the San Francisco General Labor Union, was very pleased. The president of the union, Green, said that the President's speech showed that the government was determined to maintain labor's right to collective bargaining, which would be enough to promote labor-management relations.

<p>(Washington) – It is unanimously recognized here that industry and commerce will support President Roosevelt's industrial truce plan, and it is hoped that a 30-hour work week will be established. The labor side believes that the President's speech is a sign that the government supports collective bargaining. The National Association of Manufacturers said that the President was asked to maintain the status quo during the truce period, and that labor unions should give up strikes as a means of unity. The president of the American Federation of Labor, Green, replied to the National Association of Manufacturers that the association's suggestion was just a disguise, but said that the 30-hour work week was the only practical way to relieve unemployment.

<p>(Beiping) – News from outside the customs: The National Museum of the organized organization has now determined that the former residence of Tang Yulin on Sanjing Road, Shenyang, is the museum site and is currently engaged in internal transformation. Antiques from the private residences of important figures in the Northeast and Tang's private collections have been included. Recently, the Japanese have also purchased thousands of valuable antiques in Tianjin and other places for 45,000 yuan, including famous tombstones from the Northern Wei Dynasty and pottery from the Song Dynasty, worth tens of millions of yuan. The Japanese actually obtained them for 45,000 yuan, and they will be open in a short period of time. The pseudo-country's elementary schools have recently had a whimsical idea and ordered students to raise money to make four gold screens for Puyi, with the story of the Japanese fairy tale Flower Smiling Grandpa written on them. They were sent to the palace on the 30th of last month. In addition to accepting them, Puyi also sent the pseudo-Palace Minister Shen Ruilin to thank the elementary school students on his behalf. Children in the Northeast are being trained in such despicable behavior in ignorance, and the future is unimaginable. (Exclusive Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Daily Necessities Cut Off from Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Food and Salt Especially Scarce</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi have recently concentrated in Huichang and Xingguo, showing signs of plotting a southward escape. According to a recent report from the front lines: (1) On the 20th of the month, based on intelligence, over a hundred bandits, labeled a "pseudo-independent regiment," were harassing areas such as Yetian. A battalion was immediately dispatched to encircle and suppress them, and the bandits, unable to withstand the attack, fled into the mountains. Over thirty bandits were killed, five male and female bandits were captured, nine firearms, five hand grenades, two boxes of gunpowder, and a bandit banner were seized. (2) The troops stationed in Anyuan recently dispatched a team to search and suppress the remaining Communists in the vicinity. In the Bantian area near Tianxinxu, they encountered several hundred Communist bandits and engaged in a fierce battle. After the government troops launched a fierce counterattack, over a hundred bandits were killed and a pseudo-company commander was captured. (3) In Chang'anbu Huangnipaidi in Xinfeng County, the Communist bandit Pseudo-Guerrilla Brigade Commander Lan Guanglian, hiding in Zhuwu, colluded with criminals, anesthetized ignorant farmers, and induced them to become bandits. Our army learned of this and immediately went to encircle and suppress them, capturing the pseudo-brigade commander on the spot, as well as Chen Kunxian, a pseudo-Soviet land commissioner and special agent. Many hand grenades and pseudo-official documents and propaganda items were seized. (4) Huang Heling, who came to Gan County from Maodian on the 23rd, stated that when he escaped from the bandit lair, the bandit area was scarred and devastated, with only old women and children to be seen, and very few strong men. Food was scarce, and daily necessities were cut off, with salt and kerosene being the most lacking. (September 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Heavy Rain in Xuzhou, River Waters Rise Sharply <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>City Streets Three Feet Deep in Water</p>
<p>Various Rivers Show Signs of Flooding</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the Yellow River was diverted during the late Qing Dynasty, although river disasters have been eliminated, water conservancy has been neglected, river channels have become silted up, and tributaries have been blocked. Even the ditches and canals in the fields have not been dredged. Droughts result in thousands of miles of barren land, while floods result in overflowing waters. Xubu is surrounded by the old course of the Yellow River on three sides, and the terrain is like the bottom of a pot, causing the bed of the old Yellow River to be tens of feet higher than the city. In recent years, whenever there is continuous rain, the people of Xubu fear the disasters, and the farmland in the countryside is even more disregarded. This year, in the spring, the Tong County government ordered the districts to dredge the rivers, slightly clearing the waterways, and heavy rains in the summer did not cause a disaster. However, the low-lying city of Xubu and the construction funds for dredging Wenqu Ditch have been delayed time and again by the Construction Department, causing delays in effectiveness. Whenever there is heavy rain, the city residents are always on alert. However, now that the summer season has passed, suddenly there was heavy rain for days, (29th, 30th). The rain on the night of the 29th was especially heavy. City streets turned into rivers in an instant, with rainfall of over three feet on flat ground. The amount of water in the old Yellow River at the northeast two passes suddenly increased, reaching the bridge holes. The Kui River, which needs to be closed, had water level with the banks. The water depth in the northwest corner of the city, behind the county government, and in the southeast corner, inside the park, reached the knees, and most of the streets and alleys were blocked by water. Fortunately, the main hub of Quwen Ditch had been repaired locally, and the water has receded today. However, the water in the Huhhe River attached to the city has continued to increase. This is because the area affected by this heavy rain is very wide, and most of Xuzhou Prefecture has been affected. The Wei Lake and lower irrigation rivers in northern Xuzhou, the Zhong Canal in eastern Xuzhou, the Kui River in southern Xuzhou, the Longdai River in Xiaoxian County, and the Dasha River in Fengpei County have all flooded. Fortunately, the Lanfeng Dike has not yet collapsed, which is a slight consolation to the people. However, this hinders the sowing of winter wheat and affects the coming spring, so it seems that preparations must be made in advance. It has been noted that the water conservancy of Xubu was previously proposed by the Third Army Commander Wang Jun to use military engineers to build the road outside the New East Gate and to reorganize the old dikes of the Yellow River around the city to prevent floods. The administrative meeting of the Tongshan County Government also resolved to dredge the old course of the Yellow River in the northeast two passes, down to Jizuiba, to create a large and small reservoir, and to separately divert the water from the Bajian Spring in the southwest Hanwang Township eastwards into Shitou Lake, returning abandoned fields to the lake, in order to facilitate storage and discharge. These three projects are the fundamental issues of Xubu water conservancy. (1st)</p>

<p>Upstream and Downstream Are Key Routes for Assaulting Bandit Capital</p>
<p>Troops Occupy After Multiple Assaults</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The upstream and downstream areas on the border of Yongfeng and Xingguo are characterized by towering mountains and rugged terrain, making them a key route for the bandit suppression army to directly attack the bandit capital, Ruijin. They have long been occupied by the Communist bandits. On September 25th, troops were ordered to attack the area. The bandits, relying on their defensible position, put up a stubborn resistance. The troops advanced bravely, launching several assaults, and finally defeated the bandits. The bandit ranks suffered heavy casualties. The troops definitively occupied the area that afternoon. The opposing bandits were the entire pseudo-23rd Division and the pseudo-21st Division, among others. (September 29th)</p>

<p>(2)  Heng</p>
<p>We set off from Shanghai, dividing into land and water routes. I took the land route. Upon arriving in Nanjing, transportation became a problem. Later, I found a transfer company with Bian cars (light motor vehicles) directly to Wuhu. Because there were limited seats, I was sitting next to the driver. Our deputy head, Chen Weizhong, was sitting on the roof of the car. The road along the way was very flat. At Huangshan Ferry on the Anhui border, there were boats to carry the Bian car across the river, entering Taiping County. Farmers along the highway were already harvesting rice, which was gratifying and uplifting. Sitting in the car, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing, thinking that water conservancy and road construction are all constructions related to the people's livelihood. Like Nanjing to Wuhu, it originally took more than a day to travel, but now it can be reached in three hours. We cannot but praise the merits of road construction.</p>
<p>After arriving in Wuhu, I visited administrative agencies, the press, and industry associations, all of whom agreed to support us. We borrowed the YMCA as a venue and began preparations. Because the venue had already been borrowed on the 30th, we had to postpone the opening to the 31st. Because we had ample time, we decided to go to neighboring counties to do publicity work. I was responsible for going to Xuan City. Xuan City was called Ningguo Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty and held a high position in Anhui. There is a saying, "South Xuan and North Hefei." North Hefei refers to Hefei in northern Anhui. Now the Zhawu Railway (from Zhaoxian to Wuhu) has reached Xuan City. I took the train and saw that the railway management was very clean, but there were very few passengers. The car body vibrated and tilted, the reason being that the roadbed was uneven. But I in the car not only did not feel disgusted, but felt happy. The small stations along the way are mostly made of wooden boards, and the platforms are made of wooden posts covered with mud, which is very economical. The number of bridges is no less than that of the Huhang Railway (Shanghai-Hangzhou), which shows the hard work of the people involved. There are more than 100,000 residents in Xuan City. There are cross streets. The folk customs are simple. Many silk and cloth shops also sell foreign and Guangdong goods. Meiya silk sells very well. Zhonghua Enamel and Sanxing toothpaste are also selling well. Most of the cigarettes are domestic products. Levers' Soap has penetrated the area. Ren Dan (a medicine) is openly sold. Business in the shops is bleak, which has never happened before. This year's rice harvest is not good, and the commerce is feared to have no hope.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 31st, the opening ceremony of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory's domestic silk exhibition was held. More than one hundred people attended, including administrative officials, the 78th Division Commander Fu, and guests from all walks of life. They all expressed keen hope for Meiya's promotion of domestic goods. From September 1st to the 5th, there were five days of meetings, two fashion shows, and two screenings of the Meiya self-produced film "Chinese Silk." The audience was very excited and considered it an unprecedented event in Wuhu. A total of more than 27,000 people visited, with women accounting for three-fifths, which is slightly less than three-tenths of the entire population of Wuhu. At the same time, major silk and cloth shops held a grand sale of Meiya silk, and buyers were crowded every day. The goods they brought were sold out. As a result of this event, the people of Wuhu have a deeper understanding of domestic goods, especially for women. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Training Instructor of the Defense Corps Defrauds Money</p>
<p>Jiang Ruiwen, a graduate of the training center of the former county defense corps, is young, amorous, and does not engage in proper work. His life is becoming increasingly impoverished. Recently, he suddenly came up with the idea of defrauding money from various places. Yesterday, he went to the Wang family at No. 12 Guangming Bridge Alley to sell sound recordings for two yuan and one dime per two. The Wang woman thought the price was cheap, so she gave him four yuan and two dimes to buy two two's worth. Unexpectedly, Jiang left and never returned. Knowing that something was wrong, someone found him at the Luoshen Temple station and dragged him to the Wang's house. Jiang, knowing that defrauding money was against the law, secretly held a knife and attempted to stab Li Shijun, the younger brother of Wang Li. Fortunately, he was unsuccessful and escaped disaster. He was taken to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for mutual accusations. The Public Security Bureau is now sending personnel to investigate in order to resolve the matter.</p>

<p>All Tax Collectors Arrested and Imprisoned</p>
<p>The county has accumulated a large amount of unpaid land taxes over the years. The provincial departments have repeatedly urged payment, but it has not been cleared. The eastern township of the Sixth District is the worst in the entire county. The county government recently discovered that this unpaid tax was due to the negligence of the tax collectors, or even their arbitrary embezzlement. Therefore, the officials were ordered to strictly pursue the payment. Unexpectedly, eleven tax collectors from the district, including Gao Fengqian, submitted a petition requesting a temporary postponement of the collection. On the afternoon of the 1st, they jointly went to the county government to personally deliver it. The head of the Second Section, Tang Chengsi, relayed in the reception room, saying that you tax collectors are the ones who urge grain from the landowners. Now you are submitting an absurd petition to avoid collection. What is your intention? The people cannot request this kind of accumulated debt, etc. At that time, each official initially agreed to pay in installments, but then there was no specific number, so the police immediately ordered the arrest and imprisonment of all officials.</p>

<p>Frequent Reports of Robberies in the Countryside</p>
<p>In recent times, robberies and kidnappings have been heard of in the villages and towns of Wu County, especially in Hengjing and other towns along Taihu Lake. Villagers are really experiencing sleepless nights. Unexpectedly, news came that the Zhou family in Zhouxi, Xishan Township, was robbed again on the night of the 1st, with a loss of more than 500 gold. There was also a robbery in Hugengshang, Zhouzhuang Township, but the loss was small. The Second District Detective Team of the Water Public Security Bureau captured the robbers yesterday at Xuezhedun.</p>
<p>There is a rumor that the security team, which was formed by the merger and transformation of the Wu County Defense Corps and the Police Team, is being investigated and trained under orders. Therefore, Chairman Shi of the Wu County Chamber of Commerce, due to the frequent reports of robberies in the four rural areas of Wu County, specifically discussed the matter with the Wu County Magistrate, requesting that they be exempted from being transferred to the province for training in order to maintain local peace and order. The Wu County Magistrate immediately reported to the province for approval. It is now heard that approval has been granted. The Wu County Magistrate also issued a notice to various townships yesterday (2nd), strictly guarding against the lake bandits' restless movements.</p>

<p>Gao Shichun, the director of the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Dangkou Town, District 8, sent Police Chief Lin Langqiu and twelve policemen to Zhongxing Tea House and Yuexi Inn in Ganlu Town nearby at more than 3 pm yesterday to arrest eight gamblers. Afterwards, four young women who were gambling were arrested in the Wang family's house and taken together to the lookout post of the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Ganlu Town. Unexpectedly, over forty members of the first squad of the ninth team of the second district of the water police, who were stationed in the town, went to the lookout post and pleaded with Police Chief Lin, saying that two of the arrested young women were relatives and requesting their release. Police Chief Lin refused, which led to a conflict and a tense situation. Five policemen, including Wu Ruixing, Sun Yaotang, and Li Shaohua, were slightly injured. Later, through mediation by local people, Chief Gao and Team Leader Chen of the Water Police also did not want the situation to escalate, and they immediately resolved it peacefully.

<p>Cen Zhitang (字天祥), a 24-year-old son of the owner of Jisheng Pharmacy on Route Braine in Shanghai, was from Yuyao, Zhejiang. His father, named Jishi, in his fifties, was a well-reputed doctor practicing in Shanghai. Zhitang was currently working at the Shanghai Municipal Council handling housing tax matters, earning a substantial income. He married his cousin, Yu Meiqin, at the age of twenty, and they had a daughter in the first month of this year. However, Shanghai being a den of iniquity, Zhitang inevitably spent lavishly, which his father disapproved of and severely reprimanded him for. In a fit of pique, Zhitang conceived the idea of suicide and left home on the 26th of last month. He arrived in Wuxi on the evening of the 28th and stayed in room 103 on the third floor of the New World Hotel. On the evening of the 30th, he swallowed two bottles of "Middina" and one bottle of "Adalin" and lay down covered with a blanket. The next day at noon, the hotel's tea server, Shi Maorong, noticed that the guest had not yet gotten up and did not respond to calls. Suspecting something was amiss, he reported to the front desk. They climbed into the room through the balcony and found him pale and delirious, clearly poisoned. He was immediately sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the poisoning, rescue was impossible. He died at 4 PM. Before taking the poison, Zhitang wrote two suicide notes, one to his brother Cen Peng, and one to his wife, Meiqin. Yesterday (the 2nd), the deceased's family received the news and came to Wuxi, accompanied by the local village head, Xi Zhiliang, to report to the county court's prosecutor's office, requesting exemption from an autopsy.</p>

<p>A Farmer Watching Rice Paddy Killed by Cutting</p>
<p>Chen Xikun, a farmer from Hanshu Village in the Fourth District of Wuba, went to the fields to watch over his rice paddy at approximately 7 PM on the 30th of last month. He agreed with his wife, née Xu, that they would take turns guarding the fields after dinner. When his wife went as agreed at around 8 PM, she could not find her husband. She searched everywhere and called out his name, but there was no response. She went home to get a lamp and returned to search. She caught sight of her husband lying on the ground, with cuts on his head and shoulders. He had already died. Chen Xu was greatly alarmed, and cried over his body. She immediately went to the nearby police station to report the murder. Patrol officer Xu Xing immediately went to investigate the scene and discovered bloodstains on the head of Chen Gengrong, a villager from the same village. The stains were clearly visible and appeared to be related to the case. He was brought to the station for preliminary interrogation, but his statements were evasive. Yesterday (October 1st), a document was prepared to request the county court to send personnel for an autopsy, and Chen Gengrong was detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Shenshi News Agency: Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Junkers Ju 52 giant aircraft officially took off from Shanghai Hongqiao Airport at 9 AM yesterday morning to join the Shanghai-Xinjiang route for its first test flight. According to the Shenshi News Agency reporter's inquiry with the company, this flight was piloted by Otto Tezsos, the Hansa Company pilot who came with the aircraft, with telegraph operator Hensgen and mechanic Kurtshoff assisting. Also traveling with them were Meng Tiefu, the Eurasia Company's flight director. Upon stopping in Beijing, it landed at Ming Palace Airport, carrying Gan Naikang, Zhang Daofan, Li Dijun, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Li Jingcong, the company's general manager who had recently come to Beijing. They took off for Shaanxi and Gansu at 10 AM. The company sent Meng Tiefu to Lanzhou to conduct on-site inspections in order to extend the Lanzhou-Ningxia line to Baotou. Meng will return to Shanghai on the original aircraft to report. In the future, after the Lanzhou-Ningxia line is extended to Baotou, this aircraft may still fly on this route. However, Baotou has not yet been test-flown, and it is still questionable whether an air station can be established there. The use of giant aircraft on this line is not fixed and will depend on the company's profitability on each line and the number of passengers. As for Xinjiang, there has been no response since the company sent a telegram. The Shanghai-Dihua section will take some time to restore.</p>

Now, the county government has received a report from Xi Langqing, director of the county agricultural association, stating that since the beginning of autumn, there have been continuous winds and rains, and most of the cotton and rice have become moldy, making the autumn harvest hopeless, which is very different from the previous survey. He requested that personnel be sent again to re-survey the area and that relief be provided to maintain poor farmers. In addition to sending the original committee members to re-survey and verify the situation, the county government has also sent telegrams to the provincial government and the Ministries of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction, urging them to send personnel to the county for joint survey immediately.</p>

The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce presented this to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the National Government for record and distributed it to the central ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments, instructing their subordinates to take note of the case. Now, the civil weights and measures in various provinces and cities have gradually been unified. However, many government agencies that use weights and measures for public purposes have completely complied with the new system, while others are still using the old system or the British system, which is affecting the promotion and urgently needs to be promoted to complete the task.

<h3 id="e114">Sharp Decline in Japanese Goods Imports in September <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the import of Japanese goods into this port had been increasing since the revision of tariffs in July. Therefore, the prospects for trade with China were optimistic. However, the situation suddenly became sluggish in September. According to the handling of the Japan Mail Shipping Line, the association currently has no detailed statistics to publish, but the overall amount is less than 20,000 tons, which is a decrease of more than 5,000 tons compared to August. The reason for this is that bulk sugar has been overwhelmed by Javanese products, and the Kansai region has suffered from wind and water damage, so the import of groceries and other goods has almost stopped since the end of September. However, seafood imported from Hokkaido is still active and is expected to increase in the future. However, the general purchasing power is gradually declining. As for the goods from the Kansai region, it may not be possible to recover in a short period of time because the grocery manufacturing factories in that area have been greatly affected by wind and water damage. Therefore, the prospects for the import of Japanese goods into this port are worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e126">New Rice Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>New early rice from Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Suzhou, Tongli, Jiaxing, Fengjing, Pinghu, Xindai, and other places, after being milled and polished, is sold to rice merchants inland. After being whitened by inland merchants, it is loaded onto barges and transported to Shanghai. Approximately forty boats arrive daily at the rice industry docks in both the northern and southern parts of the city. The largest barges can carry up to 500 piculs, while the smallest can carry over 100 piculs. Averaging 250 piculs per boat, approximately 10,000 piculs of new rice arrive in Shanghai daily.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Stockpiling of Old Rice <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Ta Kung News Agency conducted a survey yesterday of rice shops, rice mills, grain shops, and rice retailers (the rice inventory of small rice shops of a retail nature was not counted) in the city’s rice market. The amount of old rice stockpiled reached 300,000 piculs. Due to the stockpiling of old rice and the large quantities of new rice arriving in Shanghai, the price of rice in the Shanghai market is declining daily. Yesterday's rice price lists issued by the market showed that the highest price was 12.10 yuan to 12.50 yuan, which is more than one yuan cheaper compared to a month ago. No. 2 rice, such as Tongli white broken rice, was 11 yuan, and rice from Sijing, Fengjing, and Xindai was 10.10 to 10.20 yuan. No. 3 rice, such as Lujian, Muchen, Pingwang, Qingling, Shengchuan, and Xitang, had fallen to around 9.70 yuan and 8.70 yuan. The reason for this price drop is the surplus of both new and old rice, coupled with a large stock of foreign rice.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sluggish Sales of Foreign Rice <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai rice merchants have ordered over one million bags of Saigon rice from British firms such as Tyler and Darfur, including near-term shipments for September and October, and far-term shipments for March of the twenty-fourth year, along with orders from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. Of this, 500,000 bags have already been shipped to China. Over 100,000 bags of the September-October term rice have arrived in Shanghai. The rest are being shipped directly to the provinces by the managing foreign firms. Because new domestic rice is entering the market everywhere and there is a particularly large stockpile of old rice in Shanghai, transactions of Saigon rice by various merchant guilds are limited. The recent Saigon rice imported by rice merchants is being affected by sluggish sales, and the combined interest on loans since March means that no profit can be made.</p>

<p>Drought in Zhejiang Province, coinciding with rural bankruptcy, has caused the people's livelihood to become even more difficult. Hang County, the premier county of Zhejiang, has been affected by recession for many years, leading to the decline of commerce and trade, and social economy is even more strained. This drought has lasted for three months, rivers have dried up, crops have withered, and the autumn harvest is completely hopeless. The local authorities have done everything in their power to prevent and rescue the situation, but ultimately, without a drop of water from above or a trickle from below, they could not save even a fraction of the situation. In addition, the autumn silkworm harvest has been poor, and all kinds of industries that farmers rely on for their livelihoods have completely given up hope. It is estimated that the drought will cause losses of more than seven million yuan. As the time for the recent autumn harvest approached, farmers lay prostrate in the fields, weeping and wailing, or in groups to go to the county to petition. And in the villages, there are tragedies of wives selling their children, and starving Hang County disaster victims crying out for food.</p>
<p>Suicides are also heard from time to time. If no relief is provided, hundreds of thousands of mournful cries will all starve to death. Therefore, County Magistrate Ye Fenghu gathered people from the party and government organs, local impartial gentry, and formed a drought prevention and disaster relief association to concentrate efforts on raising funds for relief. However, due to the wide disaster area and the large number of disaster victims, it is not easy to raise funds locally. County Magistrate Ye Fenghu, accompanied by Police Chief Chen Chunbai, and local gentry Zhong Weishi, Wang Jianqing, and Wu Zihou, traveled to Shanghai to seek aid from Zhejiang gentry in Shanghai and various charitable organizations in Shanghai, and brought with them a relief plan, giving a detailed account of the drought relief plan. The day before yesterday, he went to the Red Cross and the All-Zhejiang Association to request aid. Yesterday, he attended the A-Xu Disaster Relief Association meeting to report on the disaster situation. The gentlemen present were very moved and expressed their intention to do everything possible to provide relief to benefit the victims.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks the Finance Bureau to Improve Tax Regulations on Brokers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>To be handled in accordance with the joint meeting of various industries.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Finance Bureau yesterday, stating, "Since the promulgation of the broker registration tax in this city, which is handled by the municipal government, various broker trade associations have sent letters, all claiming that the complexity of the grading system, the restrictions on commissions, and the severity of the penalties are unbearable for the brokers. They have requested a meeting to seek relief measures, etc. On September 27, representatives from the Bean and Rice Trade, Timber Trade, Seafood and Grocery Trade, Fruit and Produce Trade, Pig Trade, Flower Trade, Liang Shaojiu Trade, Chicken and Duck Trade, and Produce Trade associations were convened to hold a joint meeting, and the following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Please postpone the implementation. (Reason) The Broker Business Regulations were originally scheduled to be implemented on October 1, but the time is too urgent and should be postponed. (2) Commissions should be handled according to the industry regulations approved by the Social Bureau. (Reason) See Article 18 of the Broker Business Regulations. (3) The commodity grading system is copied from the regulations set by Jiangsu Province and is not applicable to Shanghai. It should be formulated based on the actual situation in Shanghai and taking into account the opinions of various industries. (Reason) For example, the Bean and Rice Trade alone is divided into as many as twelve categories: Rice Trade, Rice Trade, Lu Chen Trade, Grain Trade, Bean Trade, Oil Trade, Peanut Trade, Cake Trade, Grain Measure Trade, Cottonseed Trade, Melon Seed Trade, and Bran Trade. For example, the Fruit and Produce Trade is divided into as many as eight categories: Fruit Trade, Peanut Trade, Melon Trade, Water Chestnut and Lotus Root Trade, Vegetable Trade, Bamboo Shoot Trade, Radish Trade, and Yam Trade. (4) Registration certificates must be certified and collected by the trade associations. (5) If tax invoices from previous years are lost during tax collection, no penalties should be imposed. (6) Photo attachment should be waived when obtaining licenses, etc." These were recorded on file. Now that the implementation period is near, since the industry members have stated various obstacles, improvement measures should be given to facilitate implementation. We hereby send this letter, hoping that your bureau will examine and approve the adoption of the resolutions made at the industry joint meeting, to promote public friendship.</p>

First, various articles and regulations promulgated by the province were extracted and printed in a special booklet. Together with the Party Department and its affiliated self-government, education, and public security organs, anti-smoking propaganda meetings were held in various districts to investigate and inform people of the laws, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and encourage smokers to be self-aware. Later, the county public security bureaus, district township offices, and social education organs were supervised to conduct a survey of smokers throughout the county and to register smokers. At the same time, in accordance with the Provincial Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium Shops, merchants were recruited to contract for the sale of opium to registered smokers within a limited time. Simultaneously, the public Shanghai Hospital and Shanghai Charity Hospital were entrusted to handle smoking cessation experiments. All smokers who voluntarily confessed to drug use or applied for smoking cessation could be sent to the hospitals for free treatment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Smoker Registration: The public security organs, district offices, and social education organs advised and encouraged people to register in accordance with the regulations based on the survey results, or to voluntarily quit smoking. At the same time, the public security bureaus and offices were urged to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that no smoker in the county was missed. However, smokers were deeply addicted and often waited and evaded registration. Therefore, starting in mid-August, the public security organs were forced to proceed. By the end of September, a total of 1,305 smokers had registered in the county.</p>
<p>Opium Sales and Smoking: After recruiting merchants to contract for opium shops and smoking dens, many applied to contract for opium shops and smoking dens. Subsequently, the Anti-Smoking Committee resolved that each self-governing district should have one opium shop, and each market town could have one or two smoking dens. At the same time, the Anti-Smoking Committee verified whether the guarantors of each applicant were reliable and whether the procedures were complete, and submitted them to the Anti-Smoking Committee for approval in order of application before transferring them for the issuance of licenses. The applications of the following opium shops have now been approved and reported: Minhang in the first district, Tangwan in the second district, Maqiao in the third district, Sanlin in the fourth district, and Chenhang in the fifth district. The approved smoking dens include two in Minhang, two in Maqiao, two in Beiqiao, two in Zhuanqiao, two in Tangwan, two in Caohang, two in Sanlin, one in Chenhang, one in Tiqiao, one in Tangkou, and one in Hehua, for a total of 18.</p>
<p>Persuasion to Quit Smoking: When registering smokers, smokers in various places were also persuaded to voluntarily confess and quit. As there was no smoking cessation center at that time, the committee negotiated with the public Shanghai Hospital to handle the matter on its behalf. The committee provided the costs of meals and medicine. Later, as the hospital's fourth-class wards were limited and the capacity for smokers was limited, the committee negotiated with the Shanghai Charity Hospital to handle the matter on its behalf. As of September, a total of 91 smokers had quit at the two hospitals. 111 people had registered for proxy rehabilitation. Including licensed smokers, the total number of smokers in the county was 1,507, accounting for 1.3% of the county's total population.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Smoking Cessation Center: In late August, the provincial government ordered the establishment of a smoking cessation center before September 30. The committee immediately prepared to rent a civilian house in Qiaojiazhai near the county seat as the site. While hiring workers to repair it, the committee selected Dr. Yu Jufang as the smoking cessation director and appointed him as the preparatory director in advance (to actively carry out the work). The house repairs have now been completed, and all necessary items have been purchased with county funds. It was formally established on October 1. In the early stages, the county issued notices to the districts to send the registered smokers to the center for treatment. The county also posted notices throughout the county stating that all licensed smokers who were determined to quit smoking early could also apply for treatment at the center. Smokers only had to pay a meal fee of 10 cents per day, and no other fees were charged. If there were any adverse reactions to smoking cessation, they would be treated free of charge to show compassion. There are currently 40 smokers undergoing treatment at the center.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Clinic: County Magistrate Pan decided that since the new county seat did not have a hospital, the Anti-Smoking Committee would also set up a clinic to handle medical treatment and health and epidemic prevention matters. All consultations were undertaken voluntarily by Dr. Yu and others, and no consultation or health fees were charged. Medicines were also given free of charge to the poor and sick, which was very well received locally.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance Changes the Tax Rate on Flat Box Matches <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To be changed to Class B Consolidated Tax from this month.</p>
<p>Request for exemption of consolidated tax on matches in Fujian Province is denied.</p>
<p>The Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance believes that the total tax on matches should be changed as soon as possible. Yesterday, it specially changed the flat box matches to Class B consolidated tax. The request of match merchants for exemption of the consolidated tax on matches in Fujian Province in order to restore the original market has been rejected. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax on Matches: According to Chief Fang of the Match Section of the Tax Department yesterday:</p>
<p>Change in Tax Rate: A reporter from the Ta Kung News Agency reported that the tax rate on flat box matches levied by the Tax Department was originally collected according to Class A, at 13.40 yuan per box. However, as the length of the match happens to meet the conditions for paying Class B match tax, all match manufacturers across the country have been notified to change to Class B tax rate from the 1st of this month. The actual tax collected is 17.50 yuan per box. Match manufacturers have expressed their willingness to accept it, and there are no obstacles in the future.</p>
<p>Fujian Tax Exemption: As for the National Match Industry Federation, Fujian Province's</p>
<p>Reply Denied: The Tax Department has been informed that tax-evading matches from Japan are becoming more and more prevalent, and domestic matches have no room to stand. It has requested that the tax payable on domestic matches in Fujian Province be exempted from entry. The Tax Department believes that this concerns national tax revenue and the Ministry of Finance cannot rashly abandon it. Moreover, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there has been no precedent for temporarily exempting the consolidated tax that has already been implemented. Therefore, the request has been rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Taxpayers' Association Requests Compensation for Victims of Public Bus Accidents <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association received a petition from Zhang Yaoting yesterday, and forwarded a letter to John Thorburn, General Manager of the Public Concession Works Department, requesting that the company be ordered to provide generous compensation using legally legitimate administrative procedures for those injured by public bus accidents. The respective letters are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Zhang Yaoting's Petition <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Petitioner Zhang Yaoting, 47 years old, resident of 3345 Robert Road, Shanghai West, is submitting this petition because of a tragic accident, and humbly requests your assistance and to seek legal compensation. The petitioner's son, Hua Wen, was intelligent and had studied at the high school department of Shanghai Private Middle School. The principal, Chen Jicheng, praised his character and learning and gave him special treatment by providing free tuition. However, due to extreme poverty in the family, on August 16th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, he applied for a job at the Kang Nao Tuo Road Public Bus Company and was hired as a ticket seller with a monthly salary of 23 yuan, which was enough to feed the entire family. He also set up a Shaw English Night School at home as a side business. Tragically, on November 23rd of the same year, after 1:00 PM, while going to the company to submit his ticket stubs, he was hit and killed by the company's No. 15039 Route 2 bus near Sichuan Road and Aido Ya Road. Regarding the negligent driver Zhao Zhongran, the petitioner received a judgment from the Supreme Court on the 17th of this month (September), which upheld the original judgment, sentencing the defendant Zhao Zhongran to a fine of 200 yuan for the crime of causing death due to negligence in his duties, and the attached private lawsuit for 10,764 yuan has been transferred to the civil court by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for filing. However, the right to adjudicate the company lies with the consul of the country stationed in Shanghai, and the petitioner finds it difficult to sue. The petitioner has only this one son, on whom he depends for his livelihood, and the entire family of four depends on his support. He died suddenly while serving the company, and he was killed by the company's bus. Under the circumstances, the company should provide generous compensation so that the living can be supported and the dead can be buried, which is in accordance with human sentiment. Moreover, according to Article 188 of the Civil Code, which stipulates that if an employer unlawfully infringes on the rights of others in the performance of his duties, the employer and the actor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation for damages. In terms of legal principles, the company shall not evade its liability for compensation for damages. However, the company completely ignores the pain of the deceased and the bereaved family, treats human life as worthless, and turns a blind eye. Since Hua's death, the petitioner has lost his support and has no way to make a living. The entire family is old and weak and is in danger of freezing and starvation. The tragic situation is very alarming, and everyone who sees it sighs and feels injustice. I humbly ask your association, which has always been concerned about the people's suffering and is admired by Chinese and foreigners, to support the weak and suppress the strong, and is relied on by the wronged and the miserable. The petitioner is extremely wronged and is in extreme difficulty. I hope that you will have compassion and grant your assistance. In particular, I petition your association to humbly request that the Kang Nao Tuo Road Bus Company be immediately instructed to compensate the amount of 10,764 yuan for the attached private lawsuit, calculated from the dead person's monthly salary of 23 yuan while serving in the company, from the age of 21 to the age of 60. I also beg you to send a letter to the consulate, instructing them to remit the full amount of compensation so that both the living and the dead can be at peace. I respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Letter to the Works Department <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir, we have received a document from Zhang Yaoting stating that his son, Zhang Huawen, was killed by a bus of the Public Concession Bus Company. After final trial by the court, the driver, Zhao Zhongran, was found guilty of causing death due to negligence in his duties and was fined 200 yuan, etc. It has come to the attention of the association that public buses have repeatedly caused major accidents, resulting in death or injury, but have never provided compensation or assumed responsibility. This is due to your department's failure to supervise and manage them, and especially to your negligence in strictly enforcing the issuance of driver's licenses. This association believes that your department is responsible for all accidents caused by public buses, which has emboldened the company to dare not take responsibility. The matter concerns public utilities. We are sending you a copy of the original document for your review, and request that you quickly use legally legitimate administrative procedures to order the company to provide generous compensation to show its responsibility. Sincerely, to the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Works Department.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Reply to Zhang Yaoting <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Dear Mr. Zhang Yaoting, your letter of September 29 regarding the death of Zhang Huawen caused by the driver of a public bus, Zhao Zhongran, due to negligence in his duties has been received and noted. Although we have won this case in law, it is very difficult to enforce due to the obstruction of consular jurisdiction. This association is also in a position where we cannot help. However, as public buses are public utilities, the Public Concession Works Department is in a position to supervise and manage them. If the department can do its best to fulfill its responsibilities, it will not be difficult to obtain administrative and moral relief. We have now forwarded a letter to the department to handle the matter. This reply is for Mr. Zhang Yaoting.</p>

<p>Automobiles are prohibited from passing at night.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction stating that a section of bridges in the province is currently under repair, and it is most dangerous for loaded automobiles to pass. With the approval of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road Engineering Office, the Jiangnan Automobile Company was ordered to quickly set up wooden fences at the cross-road sections of Liyang and Yixing stations to prevent automobiles from passing at night, and requested that its subordinates be informed, etc. It is now heard that the bureau has notified its subordinates and automobile companies after receiving the letter.</p>

<p>But there is still no definite news about its departure from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Ping An Shipping Company's Baohua steamer being detained by the Qidong County Government, the county government replied to the Shipping Administration Bureau by telegram yesterday morning, saying, "Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, your telegram is noted. This government has repeatedly received reports from various organs and letters and telegrams from the Shanghai Qidong Fellow-Citizens Association, stating that the Baohua steamer was driven carelessly, resulting in the drowning of many lives in the Sanhe Port on the 12th, requesting that it be detained for investigation. The victims and their families have filed lawsuits with the government, accusing the vessel of negligent homicide and negligence of duty, and requesting damages. This government should accept the case. Therefore, the Baohua steamer has been temporarily detained, and the shipowner Wang Yunfa has been brought to the government for questioning and is temporarily under guard. Meanwhile, the truth is being investigated and evidence is being supplemented in accordance with judicial procedures. Your telegraph is approved. The details will be replied to in a separate letter. Whether the steamer should be released first is requested from your bureau for advice." (The rest is omitted.) The Shipping Administration Bureau immediately sent an urgent telegram to the Qidong County authorities, requesting that the steamer be released first and transferred to Shanghai for handling. The county replied to the Shipping Administration Bureau by telegram, saying, "Director Peng of the Shipping Administration Bureau, your telegram is noted. The Baohua steamer has been released. Li Ming, Magistrate of Qidong County." However, at 9:00 PM last night, the Ping An Company stated that although they had been notified by the Shipping Administration Bureau that the Baohua steamer had been released, they had not yet received a telegram from the ship, so there was no confirmation whether it would arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Dispute Over the Demolition of Houses in Leyi Lane, French Concession <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The owner failed to build a fence.</p>
<p>The tenants held a general meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>Regarding the houses in Leyi Lane, An'na Jin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, because the owner Jiang Hanzhai announced an increase in rent, which was unsuccessful, he demolished the houses for reconstruction, which was opposed by the tenants. The Leiyili rent collection department, the Dick Parker Land Department, declared that it would not force tenants to move out unreasonably. The owner's side has taken further steps to exert pressure, deciding to build a fence by force and ordering the tenants to move out. The day before yesterday, a large number of craftsmen were sent with bamboo materials to build the fence. When the tenants heard the news, they came out to stop them. When the owner's side saw the tenants stopping the fence construction, they reported to the Songshan Road Police Station, requesting them to send detectives to protect them. After receiving the report, the police station sent a deputy detective to inspect the area. Tenant representatives Wang Dekui, Li Yuting, and Tang Maijin stated the reasons to the detective, saying that regarding the demolition dispute in this lane, the tenants have already petitioned the court to request an injunction against fence construction and demolition, and that temporary dispositions have been granted. Before a legal solution is reached, the tenants have the right to reside. After hearing the statements of the representatives and reviewing the owner's fence construction permit, the detective found that it had expired and could not be applied, and immediately stopped the fence construction. The large number of craftsmen then took the bamboo materials away, so the fence construction failed the day before yesterday. The tenants were deeply grateful to the police chief for handling the matter impartially and stopping the fence construction.</p>
<p>Tenants' Meeting: The Yiye Lane branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Association, fearing that the owner would come to build the fence again, convened an emergency general meeting of all tenants at the Municipal Association in the Anxin Temple at the junction of Baer Road at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, in order to find a solution. All the tenants attended, and Dong Wenli and Tong Lizhang, members of the Fourth District Branch of the Municipal Association, and Wu Kaisheng and Zhu Dianqing, legal advisors and two major lawyers, attended the meeting. Wang Dekui was elected as chairman and Yu Jingqing as recorder. After the report was made, the following countermeasures were decided: 1. All stood up to express their determination to never move no matter what pressure is applied. 2. If the owner comes to build the fence again, all the male and female tenants will come out together to stop him. 3. If the owner forcibly builds the fence, cuts off water, and demolishes the houses, they will file a lawsuit according to law. 4. When the owner announced the rent increase, he started repairs, but after collecting the back rent, he suddenly rebuilt the houses, which is not in accordance with the law. They will collect evidence and proceed according to law. 5. Another date will be set, and all will go to the Party and government organs to hold a large-scale petition, requesting relief. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Investigation: After receiving the tenants' petition stating that the owner had gone back on his word, had not increased the rent, and had demolished the houses for reconstruction, requesting assistance and relief, the Shanghai Municipal Government appointed Sun Junchangxin to investigate the details of the lane some time ago. However, the tenants have not yet received a reply.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Approves Letter from Vehicle Owner for Reissuance</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council is handling the registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers (i.e., chartered rickshaws) for private use within the concession, with offices established in Hongkou and Zhabei. This service began in September and is ongoing. Rickshaw pullers going for registration must possess an application form issued by the Municipal Council. However, since these application forms have been issued for some time, it's likely some may have been lost. The Municipal Council now announces to all vehicle owners that if a rickshaw puller has lost their application form, the vehicle owner can write a letter in their name to the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee (office located in Room 512 of the Municipal Council building) requesting a replacement, so that it can be filled out. This matter is of great importance to both vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers, and they should pay attention and follow through to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>After the founder of Shanghai's Ri Ye Bank and Great World Entertainment Department, Huang Chu Jiu, passed away and the businesses went bankrupt, creditors filed lawsuits to recover their deposits. Creditors such as Xu Peiyuan discovered that Wang Yu Tai, Liu Jia Ji, and Hua Yang Pharmacy were also shareholders of the Gong Fa Company. Lawyers such as Bian Jialu, Dong Yu, and Chen Zhi Gao filed petitions with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation to confirm that Wang Yu Tai and others were partners in Gong Fa Company. This was previously reported. After unsuccessful mediation, a formal lawsuit was filed. Yesterday morning, the court hearing was held. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer, and the defendants were represented by six lawyers: Zhang Yaozeng, Shen Junru, Wu Zhiping, Fang Jiazhen, Li Guozhen, and Li Yujun. Both sides debated fiercely on issues such as the shareholder status and the fundamental registration of Gong Fa Company.

<p>Li Hanchu, a native of Ningbo and current president of the Beijing Kenye Bank, lived at 715 Kangle Village, Foch Road with his wife Ren Ying, apart from his family in his hometown. The couple initially had no ill feelings, but their opinions began to diverge recently. Li no longer wished to live together until old age and sought a divorce. Ren Ying, because of her husband's dislike, went to her mother's home to avoid conflict. Li then took further action after his wife returned to Ningbo, engaging a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit with the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, the court hearing was held. According to the bailiff's report, she no longer lived at the address provided in the plaintiff's complaint, and therefore could not be served. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a postponement so that the plaintiff could provide the address, as the plaintiff was certain that the defendant was still in Shanghai and had not returned to Ningbo. Judge Shen then ordered a change of date for the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Yet Some Still Dare to Manufacture Large Quantities <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Arrest of One Leads to the Capture of Many</p>
<p>Seizure of Numerous Red Pills and Manufacturing Equipment</p>
<p>French Concession detectives Superintendent Lambert (transliteration), Chinese Inspector Li Yaolong, Deputy Detective Zhang Daorong, and private detectives Shen Jinshu and Liu Jinrong were patrolling the area around Avenue Edward VII yesterday morning. At 5 o'clock, while patrolling near the intersection of East Xinqiao Street on Avenue Edward VII, they noticed a man carrying three mooncake boxes, acting suspiciously and appearing flustered. They immediately stopped him for questioning. Upon opening the boxes, they found red pills concealed inside, totaling three bags, or 3,000 pills. They brought him to the police station. The man confessed his name was Zhu Renzu (30 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 53 Zhihe Road, Chinese territory). He said he had purchased the red pills from Jin Cai (29 years old, local), who lived in the attic on the third floor of 116 East Xinqiao Street, and intended to sell them in the Chinese territory. The detectives immediately rushed to 116 East Xinqiao Street, arrested Jin Cai, and found eight bags of red pills, totaling 8,000 pills, in the makeup loft. Jin confessed that the red pills were delivered by Li Fengxiang (28 years old, from Nanjing), who lived at 3 Baolong Lane, Huaizhen Street, Nine Acres, in the city. The detectives took Jin and the red pills to the police station and then, together with police detectives from the Second District, First Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, secretly went to the address and arrested Li Fengxiang. He was brought to the bureau for questioning, where he confessed that the red pills were manufactured in a workshop operated by Chen Aqing (30 years old, from Ningbo) on the second floor of 122 Route Cardinal Mercier. They then detained Li in the Public Security Bureau and reported to the head of detectives, who rushed to 123 Route Cardinal Mercier and arrested Chen Aqing. Chen confessed that the workshop was located on the third floor of the front building of the home of Zhang Rongji (30 years old, from Ningbo) and Zhang Chenshi (28 years old), a married couple, at 11 Xiaoyou Lane, 26 Luban Road. The detectives then went to Xiaoyou Lane on Luban Road and arrested Zhang Rongji and Zhang Chenshi. They found five bags of finished red pills, totaling 5,000 pills, and an oven containing three trays of red pills being baked. They also seized 12 pounds of raw materials and manufacturing equipment. When questioned, the Zhang couple said that Chen Aqing was the mastermind. They then brought the seized goods and the individuals to the police station for joint investigation. At noon, the police station transferred Zhu Renzu, Jin Cai, Chen Aqing, Zhang Rongji, and Lu Chenshi to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu convened the trial. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated that the police station still needed to conduct a detailed investigation and that Li Fengxiang, who was detained in the Public Security Bureau, had not yet been brought in. He requested a ten-day extension to investigate the case and file a complaint. Private detective Shen Jinshu then reported on the case. The court verified the warrants, briefly questioned the defendants, and then granted the request for an extension to investigate further. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun*, at 5 PM on the 1st, Chinese customs officers discovered that a steward, Yoshida Sueo, was smuggling heroin on the Dalian steamer Qingdao Maru. They immediately telegraphed the Japanese Consulate General's Police Department, who extradited the suspect. After a serious interrogation, Yoshida confessed that he had been working on the ship since 1930 and had become acquainted with the owner of Abe Pharmacy in Higashitomimachi, Dalian. On August 12th of this year, he smuggled two packages of heroin, each weighing one pound, with an estimated profit of 12.5 yuan per package, to Qingdao for delivery. When he arrived in Qingdao on August 13th, a woman personally came to pick them up, and he handed over the 25 yuan profit. On August 28th, at Abe Pharmacy, he was again entrusted with smuggling two packages of heroin under the same conditions, originally scheduled to be delivered to a woman when he went to Qingdao on August 31st. Because she did not come to the ship, he had no choice but to put them in the luggage warehouse for first-class passengers, and they were discovered by customs officers.</p>

<p>Charcoal to Be Used Instead of Gasoline</p>
<p>According to news from the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the bureau's authorities, considering the increasing prosperity of the Nanshi area of Shanghai, have decided to add more public bus routes in Nanshi. It is now planned to add routes from Ximen to Gaochang Temple and along Louma Road. The number of residents in these two areas is increasing daily, and there is a definite need to add public bus routes for transportation. However, the locations of the stops along the routes are still under discussion. Furthermore, to save expenses due to the high price of gasoline, they are studying the use of charcoal instead of gasoline. If the results are good, it can save considerable expenses.</p>

<p>Tens of Thousands of Bills Seized</p>
<p>Each Bill Is a One-Yuan Note</p>
<p>Several newly built municipal houses near the Bao Cheng Cotton Mill on Route Robert, Shanghai West, have just been completed and plastered with rental advertisements, so they are all empty. Unexpectedly, someone recently secretly set up a workshop in the empty house at No. 267 and was secretly counterfeiting a large number of banknotes. All the equipment was quite complete. However, the Xinzha Police Station of the Public Concession learned of this, and yesterday afternoon, Western Detective Benter (translator) and Chinese Detective Tang Jian, together with Inspector Gu Wentao of the Route Robert Police Station, led several police officers to the address. They broke into the house and arrested the counterfeiters Gu Xiaochen (32 years old, from Wusong), Shen Zhiyun (36 years old, from Shaxian), and Zhang Qianlong (20 years old, from Zhenjiang, an apprentice at a carving shop).

<p>Preliminary Hearing Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Ordered to Be Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>The Shun An steamer of the Shun An Steamship Company, which travels to and from Xinghua, Fujian, and other places, loaded cargo in Shanghai and set sail for Fujian. Unexpectedly, the company's manager, Chen Youbai, colluded with the shipowner, Ouyang Tai, to conspire to blow up the ship and defraud the insurance company of compensation. When the ship sailed to Sandu'ao, Ouyang Tai had a change of heart and could not bear to sacrifice the lives of everyone on board. He reported to customs and was detained in Sandu'ao. The company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, learned of this and filed a report with the police station. Chen Youbai was arrested at the Northern Steamship Company on Avenue Edward VII on the night of September 24th and escorted to the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Changnian interrogated him and, due to jurisdiction issues, it fell under the jurisdiction of Nanshi. An order was issued to wait for the transfer to the relevant authorities. This has been previously reported.

<p>10,000 Yuan Falsely Recorded as 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Crime Location Presents Jurisdictional Issue</p>
<p>Qiu Qinghang, from Hangzhou, currently resides at 7 Deshun Lane, Muir Road. In 1930, he was appointed by the Shanghai Four Banks Savings Association as the manager of the Xiamen branch. While in office, Qiu deposited one thousand silver dollars with the Chung Nan Bank in the name of the branch, but recorded a deposit of sixty thousand silver dollars in the ledgers. Qiu embezzled a total of fifty thousand silver dollars from it. In August of this year, the Shanghai headquarters transferred Qiu to Shanghai to handle matters and appointed a Mr. Huang to take over. After taking over, Mr. Huang checked the accounts and discovered Qiu's embezzlement. He telegraphed the headquarters, who reported it to the Chief Police Station. Detectives were ordered to arrest Qiu on the previous day and bring him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case, prosecuting him for occupational embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Qiu Qinghang's confession was evasive. Judge Feng Shide stated that the crime was committed in Xiamen, and the court had no jurisdiction and should transfer it to the Shanghai District Court. Police lawyer Jiang requested a temporary stay of the ruling for a few days, pending the Municipal Council's review of whether the jurisdiction was incorrect before deciding whether to transfer it. The court granted the request and ordered a postponement for two days for further interrogation.</p>

<p>No One Retrieved the Money, Money Is Now Gone</p>
<p>Clue Found in the Drain</p>
<p>Tang Naijia, a Cantonese resident living at 246 Route Doumer, suddenly received several threatening letters from gangsters between the 15th and 29th of last month. Initially, they demanded 1,000 yuan, and then reduced the amount to a minimum of 500 yuan. They arranged for the money to be wrapped in paper and placed in a drain next to 451 Jiangxi Road around 2 PM the day before yesterday. Someone would retrieve it, or they would take drastic measures. He reported the situation to the D'Estaing Road Police Station, who dispatched Chinese Detective Fan Defu and Detective Liu Decheng, along with his nephew Tang Jin, with six silver dollars in real currency and the rest filled with ghost money, carefully wrapped and secretly went to the location on time, scattering to observe the situation. Until after 4 PM, no one arrived. The detectives inspected the original site and found that the package was gone. They were very surprised. They saw that there was a hole in the drain connecting to the house at 451 (which is a printing office). They went inside and found a worker named Ji Zhongming, from Haimen, who used to work as a tea servant at the victim's place. He was arrested and confessed that his father had done this and taken the package. He was brought to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First District Court. Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan recounted the events. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Yucheng ordered a postponement for further investigation and review.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Lawyer Zhu Kuangming Accuses Lawyer Gu Jirong of Extortion and Fraud <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Stemming from a Debt Dispute Between Tao Shangen and Another Person</p>
<p>Gu and His Secretary Ji Chao Allegedly Forced Zhu to Settle</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Kuangming filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court against lawyer Gu Jirong, Tao Shangen (director of the China-Asia Machinery Company), and Ji Chao (formerly a legal secretary), accusing them of extortion and fraud. The court has repeatedly summoned them for questioning. However, due to the defendants' request for a possible settlement and the unavailability of many witnesses, no questioning took place. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce held another hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendants arrived with their respective lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Zhu Kuangming, stated the facts of the accusation, roughly as follows: The defendant Tao Shangen was involved in a debt dispute with Pan and Xie. Gu Jirong represented Tao, while I was entrusted by Xie. Later, the case was decided in the third instance, and Pan and others lost. Pan had already fled to the Chinese-controlled area. This court requested the Shanghai Local Court to assist in detaining Pan for enforcement. At that time, Pan sent a letter to Tao, stating that the case had already been settled through mediation and that the appeals in the second and third instances were not at his initiative. After reading Pan's letter, Tao suspected that I, as the representative of the defendant Xie Tiancheng, was responsible for initiating the second and third appeals. Coincidentally, Tao's friend, surnamed Xu, also saw Pan's letter and encouraged Tao to sue me for forging documents in the Shanghai Local Court. The lawyer representing Tao in the lawsuit was the defendant Gu Jirong. After they filed the lawsuit, Gu Jirong repeatedly called me, urging me to settle. I strongly believed in resolving the matter through legal means, so I refused. On August 9th, the defendant Ji Chao came to my office, claiming to represent Gu Jirong and wanting to discuss the matter with me, but I still refused. Then, on August 21st, Gu and Tao came again, insisting that I pay for a settlement, with many threatening words. Gu Jirong even drafted a settlement agreement at the time, which I asked to see and then kept. Gu and others panicked and asked me to return it. They pestered me from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., refusing to leave. I was angry at their rudeness and warned them that if they continued to linger, I would report them to the police. Gu, realizing he was in the wrong and feeling guilty, left first but ordered Tao to continue demanding the draft from me. I then reported to the Central Police Station. The entire process can be verified by investigating with the Central Police Station, which will prove the defendants' extortion and fraud. When questioned, the defendant Gu Jirong stated that he was unaware that Tao Shangen had sued Zhu in the Shanghai Local Court and did not represent him. He also denied calling Zhu to discuss the matter. He only mentioned that before Tao sued Zhu, Zhu had talked about it, but Zhu came to his office on his own. The settlement draft was also prepared in his office, and there were witnesses who could be summoned to testify. Tao Shangen denied being with Gu Jirong at Zhu Kuangming's office on August 23rd, saying that he went to Suzhou on August 22nd and returned to Shanghai on the 24th, with postal correspondence as proof. He also stated that suing Zhu for forging documents was his own initiative and that no one else encouraged him. Ji Chao stated that he knew both lawyers Gu and Zhu. He had been Gu's secretary for many years. On July 28th, he received a call from Zhu, asking him to mediate the case in which Tao was suing him, but he immediately refused. Judge Zhan stated that the case still required investigation and ordered a continuance for further questioning and summoning of witnesses.</p>

<p>Due to Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Shi Xingzhao, from Chongming, was 31 years old and lived at No. 3 Songshou Lane, Xinzha Road. He was formerly a Chinese constable No. 303 in the Huishi Police Station and had been suspended for more than two months, leading to extreme financial difficulties. Overwhelmed with distress, he became despondent. On the evening of the day before yesterday, around 9 p.m., he went alone to the Qinghe Hotel at No. 6 Lane 118, Zhejiang Road, and secretly swallowed opium in room 227 to commit suicide. At 5 a.m. the next morning, the hotel tea server Gu Bingzhang discovered him and immediately reported to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Li Shugui to investigate. He was rushed to Renji Hospital but died despite medical treatment. Three suicide notes were found on his person, stating that after losing his job, he struggled to make a living and faced extreme financial hardship, leading him to take this drastic measure. The detective had the body taken to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court sent Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue to verify the body. They confirmed that the deceased was indeed Shi Xingzhao, male, and that he had died from poisoning. The body was released to his uncle, Shi Zhijun, who signed a statement to take it back for coffin preparation.</p>

<p>Due to the enthusiastic participation of manufacturers, the exhibition found that all the originally planned venue spaces were completely booked. To accommodate those who applied later, and to promote widespread recognition of national products, it was necessary to accept the continuing registration of manufacturers.

<p>To ensure the business interests of participating national product manufacturers and merchants, the exhibition set a fixed quota for each industry to prevent the dispersal of purchasing power and avoid price competition. Therefore, after the quota for each industry was filled, the exhibition had to politely decline further applications. Those who contacted the exhibition slightly later inevitably sighed with regret.</p>

<p>Hoping for Diligent Efforts to Attract the Attention of the Industry</p>
<p>Silk industry leader Wang Yansong, in order to implement silk relief and carry out his patriotic national salvation advocacy, has, since October 1st, sacrificed the benefits of selling foreign goods and reorganized the original Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau into the Daxin National Silk and Satin Bureau, specializing in the sale of domestic silk and satin. Patriotic women can avoid being deceived into mistakenly purchasing foreign goods disguised as domestic products, and are eager to visit. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association is particularly attentive and sent a letter to the Bureau yesterday, expressing deep praise. The original letter is recorded below: "Regarding the fact that your bureau has sacrificed the benefits of selling foreign goods and is fully promoting domestic silk and satin to compete with foreign silk and satin for purchasing power in the Shanghai market, this spirit is most admirable. Its benefits to the silk relief movement are self-evident. It is hoped that your bureau will work diligently to create a new, profitable record for the exclusive sale of domestic silk and satin, so as to attract the attention of the industry, gradually prepare for a unified integration, and expand the front line of domestic silk and satin's fight against foreign countries. The Association believes that this reorganization of your bureau has a revolutionary spirit of silk relief, adding exciting color to the history of the increasingly declining silk and satin industry. A special letter is sent to express our respect, and we hope that patriotic women from all walks of life can recognize the goal and give your bureau enthusiastic support."</p>

<h3 id="e189">From Essays to the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Education Center Quarterly <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance...</p>
<p>I heard someone say that this year is the year of magazines. Whether it is literary works or theoretical works, single books are always rarely published, and even if they are published, they cannot be sold. Only magazines are flooding the publishing world like a flood. Yes, I also feel that this is the case, but I think the current situation seems to be even more extreme. Instead of calling it the year of magazines, it seems more appropriate to call it the year of essays. You see, even magazines, those that are thicker and more rigid, are rarely published anywhere. Aren't all the things that can really be widely popular essay publications? This is probably the trend of the general reading world. Is this trend good? Personally, I still hope to read more systematic things. Fragmented reading makes it impossible to grasp the center of a thought. I don't think there is much benefit. Although short and concise essays are sometimes very enjoyable to read, they don't seem suitable for serious study. Is my opinion wrong?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because of such a prejudice? Among recent publications, I am most happy to read the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Education Center Quarterly, because there are several very systematic and practical articles inside. The ones we think are most valuable are "The Trend of World Thought," "A Review of Soviet Russian Philosophical Thought," and "The Trend of World Politics." These articles use very simple explanations and very concise writing to give us a miniature of the current world cultural and political situation, which is of great help to us when we want to understand other individual issues in the future, so I have discussed each article very carefully. But my own judgment is very weak. I only think that everything they say is reasonable and correct. I don't know if there is anything wrong or that needs to be criticized. I hope you will also criticize these articles. If there is anything inappropriate, please point it out, so that we can get more benefits.</p>
<p>Lin Jun's letter</p>
<p>The situation in the publishing world that Mr. Lin said is real. Essays have become the darling of the current publishing world, that is, the darling of the general reading world, because if the reading world does not welcome them, the bookstore owners will never be so happy to publish them. From the perspective of reading benefits, it is easy to fall into low-level tastes to only talk about essays excessively, especially shallow and boring essays, and the result is of course not good. But good essays can cleverly expose and criticize the ills of social reality. After reading them, we can recognize many dark sides of social reality. Sometimes, even the long and lengthy articles do not pay attention to the things that can be seen clearly, which is the benefit of essays, that is, the place where essays are worth talking about. Of course, we cannot only know how to read essays because essays have this advantage. Essays, because they are short, can only grasp one aspect of the conversation and cannot take care of the overall situation of things. When reading essays, if you do not have a foundation in your own thoughts, you will often be led into a very narrow consciousness, clinging to one aspect of the truth, and unable to recognize the changes in righteousness, which is very dangerous. Therefore, essays cannot be taken to talk about exclusively. Talking about essays must first study solid theories, so that thoughts have assurance and are systematic, so as not to be harmed. From this point of view, we are very sympathetic to Mr. Lin's dissatisfaction with the current trend in the publishing world that places too much emphasis on essays. Our cultural world is still very young, and we still need more theoretical and solid masterpieces. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: The People Traveling in Business Return Home to Yongshou to Bid Farewell, the Great Monk Arrives in Chang'an</p>
<p>The child's father was already the third generation to come to Gansu. Unfortunately, in 1929, he was forced by military officers to join the army and was taken to Xi'an. Two women, one middle-aged and old, and the other who was in her prime, also became middle-aged, and the little girl also grew up. They thought that it was not a solution to continue like this. Gansu was very bitter, and the people who cultivated the land could not eat their fill, let alone a family of three women, so they abandoned their home and came to Xi'an. They said... even if they couldn't find the child's father, the child's uncle was an actor, and it was said that he was also in Xi'an, and maybe they could find him. Even if they couldn't find him again, they were willing to give the girl away. The dowry would not be collected, as long as they could settle the two older women, and they would be willing to be the third or fourth concubine. Old Li, do you think this is a good thing to hear? Unfortunately, I am a guest and cannot stay for a long time, otherwise, why not do such a cheap thing? Li Shilian smiled... You have inquired so clearly, you probably really have this intention. Jia Duocai said... I really didn't expect that such a good girl would come out of that poor place. His long blue floral cloth jacket, red and white face, and two white ear circles on his ears, of course, this is not platinum. Because it is not gold, it can be seen that this child also fits that sentence, love is natural. Alas! This impression is too deep for me. Saying that, he picked up the wine pot and poured a cup of wine, holding the cup directly to the tip of his nose. Putting down the wine cup, he picked up the chopsticks and just kept poking at the vegetables in the bowl, still shaking his head and savoring the beauty he had seen. Li Shilian smiled... That's right, this person is not bad. Jia Duocai said... Your words are so blindly agreeable and extremely boring. How do you know that the girl looks good? Li Shilian said... I have a message that I haven't told you yet. Guess where I went to my wife's place today. While saying that, he shook his head a few times, showing his smug expression. (31)</p>
<h3 id="e191">Remembering a Talented Ballad Singer <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>As the saying goes... "Every profession produces a champion." To drop a word of literature, it is called... "No land, no talent." Storytellers in the past, because they relied on a mouth to exchange for food, traveled around the world for many years, and were called by the public "Jianghu friends who eat empty meals." They do not have a high social status in society. However, everything cannot be generalized. Old book listeners will not know that there was a famous ballad singer Ma Rufei in the late Qing Dynasty. The Pearl Pagoda that people sing today is a script that has been modified by him, so it is particularly elegant and interesting. I am afraid that few people know that he has the talent of an unattainable artist. I will describe an anecdote of his, which I heard from my father when I was a child.</p>
<p>Our hometown is Luodian Town, which belongs to Baoshan County. Every New Year in the town, there are very grand so-called horse lanterns held, (called out horse lanterns) which must parade every night from New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival; the owners of teahouses also hired storytellers to perform art and entertain guests, as an exciting event to decorate the New Year. Across from my house, there happened to be an old house with a spacious and dilapidated hall inside, which was setting up a teahouse. In a certain New Year, the neighboring teahouse also invited a storyteller, Ma Rufei. On the first night he took the stage, not long after he started telling the story, just as his spirit was gradually coming, suddenly the noisy gongs and drums sounded closer and closer; the tea guests in the hall knew that the horse lantern was coming, and went out of the hall in a swarm to watch the lantern along the street. Only Mr. Ma, who was sitting alone on the stage, was left in the hall. He could not help but be greatly disappointed. Helplessly, he had to stand on tiptoe and follow the crowd to look at the grand scene of the horse lantern outside the door, and felt that it was indeed "lantern shows are everywhere, and each has its own ingenuity." After a long time, the meeting finally ended, and the tea guests returned to their seats one after another, seemingly having eaten bear paws, and turned back to wait for the appearance of eating fish. Unexpectedly, Mr. Ma was not in a hurry to continue telling the story that had been interrupted, but he straightened the three-stringed lute, cleared his throat, and re-opened the "Horse Lantern Fu" like he was reciting it from memory, describing the ranks of the lantern meeting that had just passed in front of the door, and the various shows that were mixed together, from beginning to end in order, without any reversal or omission, and in a vivid manner. The audience all felt that the lantern meeting that had just passed was like the taste of fish, and the lantern meeting Fu that they heard at this time was like the taste of bear paws. In the sound of singing a sentence and drinking a full applause, the opening ended and the scheduled time for storytelling had passed. With such talent, compared to the ancients Cao Zijian's seven-step poem, he could only make a four-sentence seven-character poem on the spot, and there was no such a long piece that resembled the ancient style, and he had a particularly good memory, and it was really cute to talk about!</p>

<p>Friends always say... "Life is too boring now." In fact, if you can't plan to control your time, the future life will still be boring.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Biography of Mr. Jiang <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Drunken Chi Sheng</p>
<p>I have a friend, his surname is a homonym for "jiang" (stiff, rigid). Moreover, his temperament is stiff, and his situation is also stiff. Calling him "Mr. Jiang" is really accurate and unwavering, and even a little pitiful.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang is from Shaoxing... He was born with a stiff nature. His old wife had passed away long ago, and he did not remarry, nor did he have any children. He lived alone at sea, relying on teaching to make a living. Wearing old optical glasses, he specialized in poetry, saying that it was a pure old scholar. When he walked, he walked in a straight line, and his body was straight and stiff. When he spoke, he was not sloppy, and he was sixty-four. If someone told him a few jokes, he would sit upright and say... "A child cannot be taught, I and you, stop at painting." A certain family in front asked him to sit in the mansion. Because the location was narrow, they asked him to sleep in the attic. He thought that the name of the attic gentleman was not elegant, and he was angry and said... "A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated. Is this tolerable, which is not tolerable." He left without saying goodbye, and his stiffness was so great!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang has a long history in the bustling Shanghai. As the saying goes... "A tree is thousands of feet high, and the leaves fall back to its roots." He felt old and sick, so he missed his hometown in the face of the bright moon, and he had a great ambition to return. He also made a few seven-law poems, and told his relatives and friends everywhere. It is said that it is a farewell message, and it can also be regarded as a false expression of distress. Unexpectedly, after a few months, someone saw him still pacing on the road. He asked... "The fields are about to be deserted, why don't you go back?" He hesitated and replied... "Going back will eventually go back, but the schedule has not been set." Later, people realized that he wanted to go but stopped, and there was really an unavoidable reason. Originally, he had always been thrifty and self-sustaining, really so-called "a mustard seed is not given to others". Therefore, he has accumulated several thousand dollars in tuition fees over the years. If he took this money back, it would be like "returning home in brocade". It is inevitable that it will arouse the covetousness of the clan, which is really a bit dangerous. Moreover, this is the crystallization of his hard work, and it is by no means his wish to give it away in the future. Therefore, he was full of hesitation, and could not return. He still lived under the eaves of others, spending his lonely and monotonous life. Sometimes he sighed and said... "A person without money is certainly going to be stiff. I have a few dollars, and I have become very stiff. Why, why, I will be Mr. Jiang for the rest of my life." His personal destination and the disposal of money have become stiff him. In the end, there is no way to solve it!</p>
<h3 id="e194">Record of Misty Fragrance <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The hearts of our group of people also increased with infinite pleasure... The farther we were from the noisy, strict, and terrifying city of Beijing, the more excited and happier we were, and no one wanted to think about the situation after returning in the future.</p>
<p>"Ah! Spring is really the most lovely season of the year!" A piece of spring in the air seemed to have given the Empress Dowager a considerable influence; one day, she suddenly sighed to me... "In this kind of weather, people really seem to be back to their youth! Spring originally belongs to young people!"</p>
<p>Then, she recited a poem by the great Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai, "Spring Dawn," in a very beautiful tone...</p>
<p>"I sleep soundly in spring, not aware of dawn,</p>
<p>Birds are singing here and there.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of wind and rain last night,</p>
<p>I wonder how many flowers have fallen!"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager had a considerable appreciation for poetry... Although I had never seen her write any poems myself, I often heard her recite ancient poems. Among the many great poets of ancient China, the one she admired the most was Li Bai. She had read almost all of the poems written by Li Bai, or it could be said that she could recite them all. Because the Empress Dowager loved Li's poems so much, it created a trend. At that time, a group of literati in the court almost all strived to imitate Li Bai's style... Occasionally, if the Empress Dowager saw it, they would casually praise a sentence or two, and these people would be as happy as if they had received some kind of honor, and from then on they would be self-appointed and think that they could really follow in the footsteps of Qinglian. In fact, the Empress Dowager's poetry was also very shallow, but she did have some research on Chinese ancient history and those more famous unofficial histories or legends, which was beyond the reach of ordinary people.

<h3 id="e195">Beehive <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Xiong Yu</p>
<p>The beehive is named because its partitions resemble rooms; bees are generally divided into three types, namely honey bees, black bees (commonly known as iron-headed bees), and wasps (commonly known as long-legged bees). Honey bees are mostly domesticated, used to make honey, which is used in various medicines or as food. The wide range of uses makes beekeepers live by it. Black bees live in wooden caves, so they are found between old houses and old trees, which is where they gather. Only wasps can build nests, mostly in the woods. The construction takes time, and the shape is very peculiar. In my garden, there is a white bark pine tree that is more than 200 years old. The branches and trunks are lush and can be embraced, making it the crown of my county. One year, it was blown down by a strong wind, and then supported with wood, so its branches and leaves are not very high. One day, as the sunset was setting, I was talking and sitting under the tree with two or three confidants, and I saw a beehive above, with more than ten wasps attached to it. Someone said that it stings people, please remove it. I quietly loved it, and said slowly: "I saw it at the beginning, starting with one bee, hugging the tree branch, cursing the glue foam as a tie, initially like a thorn, gradually like a mushroom, now like a cup, one room is formed, then one child is born, those who are sleeping with feathers drooping are all born by one bee. The common people start with the land of a cone, combing the wind and bathing the rain, working day and night, fortunately they have built a small house to gather their children and grandchildren. Once a strong violence suddenly rises and robs it, even those who can bear it, when they hear it, sigh and have a sad color. I would like to be sad for those who are sad for the people, and to be sad for things. You wait quietly, don't be noisy, even if our group gathers below, the bees will come from and go by themselves, and will never sting each other, because the poison of the world is in the heart, and the poison of the bee is only in the tail." Everyone nodded, and I led them to look closely, without being surprised. I slightly shook it with grass, and some flew away without stopping, and some gathered on my clothes, without any intention of stinging people. Gentlemen, please observe the beehive's place, which is sticky like glue, and the wind and rain cannot defeat it, otherwise it will not be able to defeat the group of bees. Now it is as big as a plate.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Ant Army <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The character for ant was originally written as 螘, and their colors are red, black, and a yellowish-red; their bodies are divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Mountain ants and large black ants are about four to five fen in length, while small ants are about one fen in length. Although their shapes and bodies are small, they like to be united and are fond of fighting. Those of the same kind gather together to live, and there are hundreds to thousands in a nest. The internal governance is also well-organized, such as the queen ant and the male ant who specialize in reproduction, worker ants who are in charge of internal work, and worker ants who forage for food and soldier ants who are in charge of battle. When they go out to find food, observing their actions, they are single-minded and do not slacken at all. When they get a drop of food, they return to the nest and do not act selfishly. If they encounter a large amount of food that they cannot carry alone, they will quickly run back to the nest to report to their fellows. Before long, they will form a team and arrive excitedly. Seeing the target object, they do their best to drag it back together. If they encounter another tribe fighting for food, they will fight bravely and solemnly, not hesitating to sacrifice themselves, as if they have discipline. Therefore, they go forward bravely. If there are those who die in battle or are wounded, several ants will be seen dragging them back cooperatively, never abandoning them. Therefore, it is indeed worthwhile to stop and watch them. Ants are tiny insects, but their solidarity, love, wisdom, bravery in fighting, and loyalty in everything are praised by people. Once, I witnessed an even more interesting spectacle, so I will describe it to tell the readers: One evening, I was walking in the courtyard. At that time, crows were flying around and singing loudly as they returned to their nests. Crickets chirped in the shadows of the walls. There were several rose bushes here, and the flowers were in full bloom, red and white, beautiful and dazzling. Hundreds of ants gathered under the flowers. Moved by curiosity, I bent down to look and saw the ants fighting fiercely with a single-winged butterfly. Although many fell, those rushing forward did not stop. Soon, the butterfly's wings were completely broken, and it could not fly. It sometimes bowed and sometimes looked up, staggering. Behind it, hundreds of ant soldiers chased after it urgently. The vanguard ants had already caught up and jumped onto the butterfly's back. The butterfly immediately turned its head and bit them to death, abandoning the corpses. The second and third ants arrived one after another, and the momentum became more urgent. The butterfly turned its head and bit them to death as before, and dozens of corpses lay there. At that time, the butterfly was already exhausted and gradually unable to support itself. The ant army took the opportunity to press forward. At this critical moment, the butterfly quickly moved forward to reach the stem of a grass, climbed up the long leaves, and held on to the dangerous terrain to defend itself. Those who forced their way forward were still bitten to death, and none of them returned alive. The place where the butterfly defended was narrow and dangerous, only allowing one ant to pass. The butterfly had no worries about being attacked from behind, nor was it troubled by running around. Its courage was tenfold, and many ants died, but they could not defeat the butterfly. Then, the ant army was seen retreating together, gathering in one place, and whispering to each other, as if discussing something. After the discussion, they reorganized their ranks and gathered under the roots of the grass, working together to bite off the leaves. The leaves fell and the butterfly fell. The ant army gathered from all sides, and in less than a moment, the butterfly was killed. The ants then carried the butterfly's corpse and returned in triumph.</p>

<p>Held every night from 7 to 9 PM this week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Chen Boming, former professor of Jinan University and currently serving in the Political Training Department of the Military Commission, has invented the "Boming Musical Notation" after more than ten years of dedicated research. It can use the simplest musical notation to translate our country's characters and local dialects, as well as the characters of dozens of countries in Europe, America, and Japan. The rhyme is exceptionally accurate, and the spelling is extremely simple. Since its invention, it has been promoted in schools in the Northwest, Henan, Luoyang, the capital, and in the troops of the 87th Division and the First Army, with remarkable results. Datong University in this city has always paid close attention to new discoveries in Chinese and foreign academic circles. Admiring the perfection of the "Boming Musical Notation," the university specially invited the inventor of the musical notation, Chen Boming, to come to the school to give a lecture on the 21st of last month, so that students could study extracurricular academics. Recently, Dean Tai of the School of Education of the university, because the students of the school were very interested in this kind of linguistic invention, specially negotiated with Mr. Chen and agreed to invite Mr. Chen to come to the school to give a detailed lecture every night from 7 to 9 PM this week, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, in order to practice. Last night was the first night, and the number of students participating in the study of the musical notation exceeded the number of sign-ups by more than double, reaching more than 90 people.</p>

<p>Director of the Education Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, delivered a speech at the Members' Congress of the Third District Education Association of this city.</p>
<p>Chairman, comrades, today is the Members' Congress of the Third District Education Association of this city. I am invited to say a few words. I am very happy to be able to take this opportunity to share some of my recent thoughts on education with you all.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, especially this year, you have probably seen many criticisms of education in newspapers, magazines, or other books. Because the national crisis is getting heavier day by day, and the world situation is getting more dangerous day by day, everyone feels that the education cause is also becoming more urgent day by day. And we, who serve in the great education circles, whether we are education administrative organs or people in schools, are also taking on more and more important responsibilities. Generally speaking, you all know where these many criticisms are pointing. Why is there a national crisis? Why have we suffered so many major humiliations like the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident and have no way to resist to the end with force? The root cause is all attributed to the failure of education. Because the past education cause was not well run, after decades of running new education, the result is not only unable to save China from the dangerous situation, but the danger is getting heavier day by day. This is obviously a failure of education. If we continue to muddle along for another five or ten years, I am afraid that the trend of international oppression will not allow us to wait peacefully for this long period. Naturally, we should quickly transform the education that is considered to have failed.</p>
<p>Under this major premise of requiring the transformation of education, many people have thought of transformation plans. The failure of past education is recognized by everyone, and the transformation plans are naturally different. For example, if someone has a very serious illness, they will definitely ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Chinese medicine has its own medical methods, and Western medicine has its own medical methods. Similarly, Chinese or Western medicine may also have different medical methods. Therefore, under the major premise of transforming education, the plans put forward are also different. However, there is now an obvious common trend, which is that past education cannot create a group of students who can generate a kind of power after they graduate. What kind of power? That is the power to save themselves and save the country. In the past, students not only did not have the power to save the country, but they really did not even have the power to save themselves. Just looking at the so-called career movement of college graduates in Beijing, Tianjin, and parts of Shanghai this summer, we can expose that our education not only cannot enable students to have the power to save the country, but also cannot enable students to have the power to save themselves to find food. Therefore, the transformation of education should start from this place. How to make these students at least have the power of self-rescue first? If the power of self-rescue is really there, the power of saving the country will also follow. This kind of education that teaches students to save themselves and save the country is the road that future education must take, that is, production education or vocational education. Mr. Wu Zhihui recently wrote a long article in the Morning Post, saying that vocational education is really very good, but the Chinese people often disdain to listen to it. The term vocational education is considered not orthodox but a side branch, and most people despise it. It is better to call it "production education," and everyone may pay more attention to it. In short, regardless of vocational education or production education, people generally want to transform the education that used to specialize in writing articles, talking about law, and discussing social sciences, so that each student has the ability to produce. This kind of production capacity enables him to save himself and save the country after he leaves school in the future. Therefore, production education is a common trend in the transformation of education in the future. Now, from the central government to the provincial and municipal governments, to the people in the education circles, everyone believes that this major road of production education is the only one that should be taken in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Baichuan Calligraphy and Painting Association Holds First Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Starting today at the Huzhou Society on Guizhou Road</p>
<p>Origin: In ancient times, calligraphy and painting had the same origin, used to replace language. Calligraphy has seal script and clerical script, and the brush has square and round shapes. As painting diverged, it was divided into the northern and southern schools. The northern school is close to science, and academy paintings mostly follow it. The southern school is close to philosophy, and it is not easy for non-scholars to create it. Since the Tang Dynasty used thirteen subjects to select scholars for painting, Tang Dynasty scholars, such as Han Changli and Du Shaoling, were unparalleled in poetry and prose and all understood painting. Wang Youcheng opened the southern school, using ink and wash method. The Yuan people followed it. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty established a painting academy, specializing in proficiency. The northern school was at its peak, as for Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, the brush was simple and the meaning was ingenious, purely depicting real scenes. In the Ming Dynasty, painters were collected. In the early years of Hongwu, southern scholars were almost completely slaughtered, and Wu Wei was selected as the top painter. From then on, Jiang San Song, Guo Qing Kuang, and Zhang Ping Shan and his followers stirred up waves and adopted his techniques to make a name for themselves in the world. Those in the know called it wild fox meditation, and the northern school was swept away. Now, looking back on the past, tracing the source, not being surprised by the differences, hoping to reach the ultimate path. Yang Ziyun said, a hundred rivers study the sea, and when they reach the sea, they know what to choose, and can observe, without simply drawing oneself, one can achieve great success.</p>
<p>Evolution: This association aims to study calligraphy and painting, promote art, and promote culture. On November 15, 1933, Huang Binhong, Wang Jiyuan, Yan Kechang, Wu Mengfei, Liu Kang, Wang Yuanbo, Liang Shu, Zhang Xuan, Chen Renhao, Mo Yunxuan, Zhu Wenyun, and eleven other artists and scholars in Shanghai initiated the organization. Although art has myriad strands, its return is one. Just as a hundred rivers diverge and converge in the sea, dividing to the extreme is profound, but it must be united to achieve greatness. Therefore, it was named the Baichuan Calligraphy and Painting Association. It first gathered in the Huangshan Shuinan Shuangtang Painting Room in Shanghai and passed ten simple articles. It focused on practical research and discussion. It gathered once a week to study. Each member submitted several calligraphy and painting works for mutual evaluation and invited artists and scholars who were deeply knowledgeable in and out of the association to speak on the theory of calligraphy and painting, in order to achieve mutual learning. On March 6, 1934, the sixth research meeting was held. It was agreed that the membership of the association was gradually increasing and the organization should be meticulous. The simple articles of the association were considered too brief. It was resolved to revise them, and on March 12, the first members' congress was held at the Shanghai YMCA, and the constitution was revised and passed. The constitution consists of eight chapters and nineteen articles. According to the constitution, the first board of directors was elected, with Wang Jiyuan, Wu Mengfei, Huang Binhong, Zhu Wenyun, Wang Yuanbo, Yan Kechang, and Mo Yunxuan as directors. Wang Jiyuan was elected as the chairman. Since then, the organization of the association has gradually become complete. Although it has only been ten months, the membership has increased to more than 40 people, and the spirit of research is booming. On September 4, the second members' congress resolved to hold the first calligraphy and painting exhibition from October 3rd to 6th at the Shanghai Huzhou Society, for the appreciation of artists and scholars at home and abroad, and to promote the interest of colleagues in exploration.</p>
<p>Works by various artists: Wang Jiyuan, He Xiangning, Wang Yuanbo, Liang Kaishi, Wang Shengyuan, Wu Fuzhi, Wu Wenzhi, Yu Jingzhi, Liu Yazi, Yu Jianhua, Lang Bolong, Hu Youge, Ma Gongyu, Xu Peiji, Xu Zhengbai, Chen Renhao, Cao Yunzhong, Huang Binhong, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Chenbo, Zhang Xuan, Zhang Tianqi, Mo Yunxuan, Yan Kechang, Zhu Wenyun, Zhu Lesan, Liu Hairuo, Liu Shuxun, Liu Haisu, Pan Tianshou, Liu Kang, Xie Gongzhan. The works of the supporters include Lin Yuchao, Wang Yiting, Ju Juesheng, Ye Yufu, Cai Yuanpei and others.</p>
<p>Opening Dates: October 3rd to 6th, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily.</p>

<p>Three Major Reasons</p>
<p>The world's top amateur tennis player, Englishman Pan Lai, has maintained his amateur status and has not yet turned professional. According to his own account, there are three reasons: 1. The British government will extract half of his professional income as tax; 2. The British General Association and senior figures will no longer treat him as a noble guest, but will regard him as an ordinary performer; 3. His lover does not approve. Therefore, due to various losses, Pan Lai resolutely refused the offer of 50,000 yuan and said, "Please tell the world for me, Pan Lai is not happy about this."</p>

<p>Registration closes on the 17th, and the competition starts on the 20th.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA believes that volleyball is not yet very popular in Shanghai. It initiated open competitions a few years ago and created the Standard Cup the year before last in order to actively promote it. Now, in order to allow men and women to participate in this sport, the Standard Cup (men) and the Dahua Cup (women) will be held together to promote it. Registration is now open from now until the 17th of this month, and the competition is scheduled to start on the 20th of this month (both cups are the same). Any groups, schools, and institutions in Shanghai with volleyball teams can register at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. A registration fee of two yuan and a deposit of five yuan must be paid at the time of registration (the deposit will be returned after the competition). The men's registration is limited to twelve people per team, and the women's registration is limited to fourteen people. The association has printed a brochure that can be requested by mail.</p>

<h3 id="e226">On Advocating Science and Engineering <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>If one is worthy of being called a modern Chinese, who would dare to defy the great trend of the world and express disagreement with advocating science and engineering! Novelists and playwrights are all people who need to enjoy modern life, and they will never raise the banner of rebellion against science and engineering again. If the value of novels and dramas is really just a kind of leisure toy, then in countries where science and engineering are not developed, there is not even the minimum resource for life, so where can there be the spare energy and leisure to spend on toys! According to this, the enthusiasm of literary figures for expecting the development of science and engineering should be more urgent than anyone else. If it is really because literature is too rampant that it has dragged down the decline of science and engineering in China, then as long as the gentlemen in China who study science and engineering can stand up and responsibly say, "China can stop buying foreign goods within a few years, and can stop hiring foreigners as engineers within a few years." I believe that in order to entrust their lives to the gifts of scientists and craftsmen, all those engaged in literary work will certainly be willing to obey their orders within the specified time limit, automatically put down their pens, and wait for the development of science and engineering. If there are also literary workers who can help them cheer and wave the flag for them, they will be happy to serve as long as they order.</p>
<p>I only hope that the reason for the decline of science and engineering in China is indeed so simple! I definitely do not hope that the decline of science and engineering in China has more complicated reasons than this. In order to advocate science and engineering, it is only necessary to shut down one or two literary publications and two or three literary newspaper sections, isn't it easy?</p>
<p>Literature is something that is unfathomable in its profundity, and the criteria for good and bad are like the market price in the morning and evening, making people uncertain. Therefore, some people spend their whole lives studying literature and have no hope for their whole lives, but only waste precious time and energy. It is truly a dead end and meaningless for a young man to fail in learning calligraphy, then learn swordsmanship, and then study literature. I believe that literature is something that one only studies when one is happy to study it. It is simply tyrannical to force someone who is not interested in literature to study literature. People can reluctantly study science and engineering and succeed, but they can never reluctantly study literature and become a literary figure, because literature cannot be learned. Very few of the world's great literary figures come from literature departments; George Bernard Shaw, Romain Rolland, and Maxim Gorky did not receive sufficient education. During the Qing Dynasty, scholars were selected solely on the basis of literature, but not a single literary figure was produced; and Cao Xueqin and Shi Nai'an were not known to have prominent academic titles. Therefore, shutting down literature departments may not be destroying literature, and establishing many literature departments may not be advocating literature. Literature does not need to be advocated, and advocating it is only like this; literature does not need to be cursed, and cursing it will not be like that. In fact, there is absolutely no such thing as everyone going to study literature. I do not believe at all that this useless literature can have such a great bad influence that it can drag down the decline of science and engineering in China! If it is said that the decline of science and engineering in China is entirely influenced by literature, then literature is too highly regarded. I dare to assert that there must be other more important reasons for the decline of science and engineering in China.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, although China's education system inevitably had the drawback of being impractical, there were special schools in each province for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, mining, railways, textiles, and medicine, etc., and universities had special departments. At least, the majority of students sent abroad by the national treasury every year studied science and engineering. Why are these experts with skills unable to do anything after they leave school and return to the country? One reason is that the government before the revolution did not take responsibility for allocating and regulating, leaving room for talents to develop adequately; the other reason is that the people were unwilling to invest in setting up factories, helping experts to have the possibility of testing their ambitions. Among them, there was no lack of experts who were determined to engage in science and engineering and did their best to set up a small-scale factory; but the Chinese only allow success and do not allow failure. Most of these people suffer a setback and are unable to recover. In the end, they either become depressed and fall into decline, or they completely abandon what they have learned and seek other ways of life. There are such examples in society, and those who come later no longer have the courage to continue trying. Therefore, those with better opportunities join the political world and become scientific officials who can also be regarded as specialized; those who are less capable mix in schools and become science teachers; the most unlucky ones can only wander in the attics like ordinary boring literati, specializing in writing scientific foreign stereotypes and exchanging foreign royalties for a living. In this situation, how can the future of science and engineering in China have any hope of being promoted! I pray that Mr. Wu, who advocates science and engineering, will write more articles in this area, urging the young people who are studying science and engineering today not to follow the mistakes of the past, immediately initiate national salvation savings, open several small-scale factories, and invite the experts who study science and engineering to come out and show the goods to the people. I hope that in the near future, there will be a "paper mill" and a "woolen mill" appearing. If someone properly initiates this matter, I will definitely pawn my pants to acknowledge a share and allow the experts in charge to have three consecutive opportunities to fail. As for the relationship between science and engineering and literature, it is still inevitably a "hypothetical question." Although it is said logically, we always feel that it is irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Autumn in the Old Capital <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Water chestnuts, withered lotus, red dates.</p>
<p>In Beiping, these three embellishments are indispensable in autumn. On the streets and alleys and in tea houses, vendors shout loudly with their ears covered. They carry a pair of water chestnut scissors and, when a transaction is made, "neatly" cut the water chestnuts, pad them with lotus leaves, and hand them to you. When your own lotus flower vat is empty, you can still see half a pond of withered lotus leaves in Beihai Park. Someone trims them, fearing that the yellowed and defeated leaves will drag away time. Long dates, round dates, and sour dates slowly turn red on the trees. Sometimes they are beaten down by people before they turn red. Green dates have no insects, and few good dates fall naturally. Especially the children of Beiping, if they do not have date trees in their own homes in autumn, they look forward to whose low wall or broken wall will have date branches hanging outwards. Then the bamboo poles rustle, and the children eat and have fun. The small date trees growing out of the cracks in the city walls are enough to be taken seriously. However, the harvest that takes more effort is sweeter. People are busy with nothing to do when they are idle.</p>
<p>There are fewer tourists in the park, and the tea houses are empty, but there are many people strolling back and forth. These are people who really come to take a walk. Often, the people who come to the tea houses in summer to drink tea are just joining in the fun, in order to see other people's elegance and let others see their own leisure. This is considered strolling.</p>
<p>Instead, the business of movie theaters and theaters is booming again. The scorching summer makes people stay indoors because of the smell of carbonic acid gas and sweat. In autumn, however, they are resurrected. Famous actors put on great plays, and tickets are always sold out for more than half a week in advance. Don't be surprised that there are so many theatergoers in Beiping, because people in all walks of life in Beiping are addicted to opera. Rickshaw drivers will come for two segments while waiting for business at night, facing the buildings where their masters are enjoying themselves. Students and even professors are all theater customers. This is called "Jingban" opera howling!</p>
<p>People say that Southerners like to eat, but why is Beiping any different? The fat crabs in autumn tempt people in the vegetable market. The newspapers publish advertisements for "newly arrived big crabs" from restaurants. Only the masters who don't count money go there, because they cost three or four mao each. Most people buy them home to cook themselves.</p>
<p>Mutton sells better than pork in Beiping, especially in autumn in three ways of eating: hot pot, barbecue, and stir-fry. There are particularly famous old shops, but almost every restaurant has them. Eating them hot with shallot sauce, garlic, and other ingredients is really a different kind of flavor. This is a very flavorful embellishment in Beiping. When the time comes, eating mutton with grandmothers and nephews is taken very seriously.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is indispensable for Rabbit God and mooncakes. Rabbit God has also been improved, with some sitting in cars and some sitting in airplanes, becoming modern. However, that stupid look cannot be changed, and people still find it fresh. Chestnuts are also cheap, 1.2 mao per catty. By the end of the year, they can be as cheap as 5 or 6 fen per catty. People can't forget the "festival."</p>
<p>The number of people who are quietly worrying about autumn is a hundred times greater than the number of people who smile comfortably. With the first autumn wind, people remember the winter's cold, and coal and winter clothes are all problems. The people who have sent winter clothes into the high walls are calculating how to get them out.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Small Talk Among the Eaves <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Three: The Fated Drift</p>
<p>Those who are used to seeing stars all know how small the moon is, because it often passes between stars that are only two or three degrees apart, with plenty of room. And the distance of two or three degrees between two stars has always been seen as very short. The moon passing between the stars is one of the beautiful phenomena in the sky, but this can only be seen clearly during the new moon and waning moon, so those who look at the stars are not as interested in the full moon as ordinary people. The particularly bright full moon in autumn nights drowns out the Milky Way and most of the stars, which can almost be considered a hateful thing. Having only the moon and no stars makes the sky lose most of its interest. Ordinary people look at the moon and also hope for some wisps of cloud, forming a "cloud-backed moon," and if it is really clear to ten thousand miles without a cloud, they would find it monotonous. Usually, the moon seems static, but borrowing clouds can make it seem to move, which is even more lively. Those who know the stars see the moon as moving, and the stars are not easily grasped when they are not visible, while the moon seems to be stationary on the celestial sphere, turning with the sky.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the light of the full moon does not obscure stars of the second magnitude or higher. So the remaining countable ones! Are roughly all below the number that can be counted in one breath. Stars can still be used as markers. For example, this time, on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I saw the moon west of the Shi constellation, but on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I saw it east of the Shi constellation. Now, in these two constellations Shi and Bi—these two constellations are the large quadrilateral in the sky. Looking due east after dark, almost anyone can recognize them—we can see the distance between them and the moon every night, which is very pleasing. The moon returns to the Shi constellation about every 27 days, which is a week of its journey in the sky.</p>
<p>We should consider it pleasant that he travels around like this. The Western moon goddess is fond of travel, but this fondness probably arose in the hunting era, so she only wanders in the forests. The Chinese moon goddess, after the autocratic system, has changed her nature. She is a rich and noble immortal who lives in a different residence every day. The so-called constellations (宿), are the meaning of residence (宿所). It is certainly unreasonable to still pronounce it as xiu (秀) now. The twenty-eight constellations are the daily residences of her journey for more than twenty-seven days. The old calendars now still note things like "Fire Room Build" (火房建) every day. The room (房) in it originally meant the constellation where the moon was located, but unfortunately, because of the difference between two sevens plus one-third and two eights, it is no longer accurate. However, based on what is noted on August 15th of this year, adding nine constellations, and then adding one constellation every three cycles, it can still be roughly accurate. This not only increases our interest in looking at the moon, but also allows us to recognize the twenty-eight constellations.</p>
<p>No matter how people set down the daily residences for the moon, the moon's circumnavigation is ultimately nothing more than drifting. The route of the residences is fixed, but her journey sometimes goes up and sometimes down, and her phases do not correspond to a week. Using astronomical explanations, of course, everything can be explained logically, but even if we know all that, it only makes us feel that her drifting is originally fated.</p>
<p>Not only these actions with known laws are completely fated, but also the moon's actions that are not yet clear may gradually escape the Earth's gravity and fly elsewhere; or it may gradually increase in weight and get closer to the Earth; or it may be swept away by unknown forces. No matter which it encounters, it is still fated. We will be able to measure that the moon has a destiny, but I don't know if the moon knows it. Like humans who are not very willing to admit their own destiny, she probably doesn't know either.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Welcome to the "Translation" Monthly <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Che</p>
<p>Previously, I once revealed "Hope" in this newspaper, saying, "We, a group of young people who are not very familiar with foreign languages but are seeking foreign heritage to engage in writing, cannot help but thank the translators of the past decade. Therefore, at present, I do not expect great creations to be produced, but I eagerly hope that more foreign literary masterpieces will be translated over." Therefore, recently seeing the appearance of the "Translation" Monthly (the first issue was published by Life Bookstore on September 16th), I personally not only feel very welcome, like "a baby lacking breast milk" once getting a wet nurse, but I also dare to raise my hands presumptuously and express a warm welcome on behalf of the young people who study literature like me.</p>
<p>Although, according to the "Preface" of the "Translation" Monthly, the translators "only occasionally read foreign works and translate them on a whim" and print them "as a reference for people who like to read translations"; they are not willing to deliberately and grandly raise the banner of translation, operate a company that transplants foreign literary heritage, and breastfeed us infants "who often cry in hunger in the slums." However, I want to say that after only reading the first issue, I personally have always felt like I have drunk a full meal of nutritious milk. Because this newly opened shop, under the honest signboard of "I am confident that I will not be sloppy," also features several old technicians who have refined good foreign milk for us to eat for the past decade. Although some of them are wearing different clothes than before, making us afraid to nod and greet them for a while, after drinking it, we immediately understand.</p>
<p>I think there must be many young people who feel the same as me. I hope that this new shop will open on time and expand its business (publishing series) so that the hands we have raised enthusiastically will not fall down coldly.</p>
<p>This is a hope realized, followed by another hope.</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"She...she went to call them." Mr. Feng Wen muttered, pacing around the room like a headless fly, then went out. After going out, he returned, arguing with Dong Sheng.</p>
<p>"I've said it already, there's no way, no way."</p>
<p>"You just say the easy things. Saying there's no way, is that the end of it?"</p>
<p>"If it's not the end, what can be done... I can't hold onto other people's feet…"</p>
<p>"What happens if you can't hold onto their feet?" Mr. Da Sheng continued. Dong Sheng waved his ginger-like hand, limping, into the dark room. Seeing the small room crowded with people wearing orange exercise uniforms, he was stunned, unable to speak for a moment.</p>
<p>"Ru Tong's father… Ru Tong's father, come and take a look!" Just as the two of them were at a loss for words, a woman's voice suddenly came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen started pacing around the room again.</p>
<p>"Go, your wife is calling you!" Mr. Da Sheng, knowing the reason for Mr. Feng Wen's embarrassment, said, "Anything you need, go to my shop assistant, and we can settle the accounts later. The squad leaders need supplies, you have to prepare them first."</p>
<p>"Then, brother Da Sheng, I'm leaving everything here to you, everything to you." At this moment, Mr. Feng Wen felt that being the village head was not something anyone could do! Attention! Present arms! Present your mother! Present what the hell?</p>
<p>"You tell me, why do you say there's no way?"</p>
<p>Dong Sheng, who had been stunned in front of the squad leaders and those in orange exercise uniforms, stood in a corner under the black ledger table, as if he had lost his breath. He was afraid that "锡茄烟" (a type of cigarette) and "洋火腿" (foreign ham) would be sent over again, so he was dazed. When Mr. Da Sheng asked him, he finally woke up and responded with a few "Oh! Oh." Finally, he said tremblingly,</p>
<p>"Oh oh, I've been running for three days, and and and went around for three days, but no no no one else came to the door."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Mr. Da Sheng frowned first, then lowered his chin. Then he saw the squad leader's eyes, green like a cat's eyes, shining sharply.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Wild Plunge in Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Further Drop of Over Two Dollars</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, with a severe plunge. This is because of the sluggishness of American cotton, the poor environment for Four-Ring yarn, and the foreign merchants' constant selling without any intention of covering their positions. As a result, there are ample chips on the table, and many bulls, seeing the poor atmosphere, are cutting their losses, making the situation even more alarming and causing the market to plummet. However, the continuous decline in recent days has been too drastic.</p>
<p>Speculative Yarn Bulls Cutting Losses</p>
<p>The speculative yarn market opened with a sudden drop in American cotton, hitting a new low, causing panic. In addition, the liquidation of bulls in the financial sector was not yet complete, further weakening the market. In the first two to three rounds, selling intensified, with all months falling by $1.47 to $1.48. In the afternoon, there was still a lack of buyers in the market. It was reported that only over 900 bales of spot yarn were traded. Tongfu liquidated a large amount, and all months fell by another $0.46 to $0.47. The total daily turnover was 67,850 bales. Sales: Shenchang 2,300 bales, Hengyi 1,645 bales, Hengchang 1,950 bales, Renfeng 850 bales, Yuande 2,050 bales, Changyu 1,550 bales, Senkang 800 bales, Junchang 950 bales, Tongfu 3,300 bales, Jinchang 1,300 bales, Zhenda 600 bales, Huikang 750 bales. Purchases: Yuantai 1,350 bales, Deki 650 bales, Xiesheng 2,500 bales, Changyu 2,050 bales, Shenji 800 bales, Dafu 750 bales, Yuanda 750 bales, Jinchang 1,050 bales, Daji 3,250 bales, Yuda 900 bales, Dafeng 1,800 bales, Mingde 1,350 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending downward due to the daily decline in American cotton and the weakness of Indian cotton. As the yarn market continues to fall, factories are facing increasing difficulties and are reluctant to purchase high-priced raw materials. As a result, spot cotton business is extremely sluggish. However, large holders are absorbing large quantities and are reluctant to sell, keeping the market relatively firm. However, given the ratio between cotton prices and yarn prices, it will be difficult for the cotton market to remain stable.</p>
<p>Speculative Cotton Weak</p>
<p>The speculative cotton market opened with a relatively large drop in American cotton, approaching the $1.20 mark, causing panic. Selling pressure increased slightly, with all months falling by $0.40 to $0.45. In the afternoon, the Japanese company Eastern Cotton sold off October contracts, and the yarn market continued to fall, further weakening the situation. All months fell by another $0.15 to $0.20. The total daily turnover was 193,300 piculs. Sales: Changfeng 11,300 piculs, Runkang 14,600 piculs, Dafu 1,700 piculs, Zhenda 1,700 piculs, Xincheng 1,800 piculs, Xiesheng 3,100 piculs, Dachang 1,800 piculs, Taichang 4,000 piculs, Yuantai 1,600 piculs, Ruida 1,400 piculs, Hengyi 9,400 piculs, Renfeng 1,800 piculs, Tongxing 4,600 piculs, Yuanyi 2,400 piculs, Changhe 1,400 piculs.

<p>American Cotton Falls Over 20 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton fell due to reduced buying, political news favoring sellers, and Wall Street's sluggishness. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 points, and futures fell by 20 to 23 points. British cotton futures rose by 6.7 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the liquidation of bulls and selling by speculators, but rebounded after buying by brokers. As a result, Pingguo'er and Bai Luo Xi rose by one rupee, and Aomula rose by 7.5 annas. The original telegram is on the left: (One-day telegram)</p>

<p>The gold market suffered a sharp drop in exchange rates, and the psychological effect was that fellow traders bought American dollars and sold English pounds. Although there were rumors that caused it to rise in the middle of the day, the overall trend was quite uncertain. Initially, overseas silver markets saw a consistent rise in both British and American markets. It was said that after the US market closed, it bought in at the listed high of .0625. Prices and stocks both fell. London raw gold rose by 4.5 pence. The voices hoping to stabilize the national currency in America were once again strong, leading to a sharp drop in exchange rates. However, people were no longer paying attention, as the rise in silver prices was expected. Preliminary transactions outside the market fell to $15-16. After opening, the price trended upwards, but remained volatile. Later, sentiment suddenly turned positive, and Chinese traders repeatedly covered their positions, breaking through the $20 mark. The exchange market followed suit, and gold prices rose by over $10, a rapid increase. However, with the British actively pushing down the price of the pound, it was generally expected that silver prices would rise, and the exchange market remained normal. There was eager selling at high prices, but sentiment was still good, and there was a lot of volatility. Later, the exchange market loosened, and speculative activity increased, leading to more sellers in the market. By noon, it had turned weak. The afternoon market opened below the $20 mark due to the momentum of the morning market. After opening, it was gradually pulled up by bank purchases. When news came that Bombay reported an initial rise of 8 annas, the selling pressure was still strong, and it fell back below $20. Although traders were selling shillings, the banks were buying pounds and selling American dollars, keeping the domestic market stable. Major players were still buying at low prices, pushing it back above $20. Later, sentiment became uncertain, and gold prices rose and fell erratically, as banks continued to sell at high prices. Finally, the second telegram from Bombay reported a decrease of 1 anna, then an increase of 1 anna, resulting in a fluctuating situation. The market conditions for the day were uncertain. Although it rose, it lacked momentum. Even with rumors, there was no confirmation, making the trend difficult to grasp. Although Reuters reported that the US President had invited Hull and Mo Yutao to discuss China's silver protests, the content was not announced. This news came before the market opened but had no impact. Short positions among traders had increased to 75 firms, with total chips still at over 28,000. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $915, down $4.60 from the previous closing. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 5 pence 6875, and American exchange at $36.3125, which soon loosened. After opening, Mitsui bought American dollars for October and November at half a yuan, and it remained stable. Qianchang, Xiangfu, An, Jinfeng, and Yongtuo fell to $7.50, while Yongda, Xingyong, and Jin fell. After opening, sentiment suddenly improved, and the statement that HSBC was quoting American dollars as flat and British dollars as up 125 had no impact. Traders bought American exchange, and the domestic market tightened suddenly. Yuantian, Fengyong, Ruikang, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Yufengyong, Yuanyuan, Kangxiang, and others all entered, rising to $21.50. Although Fuchang sold to .05, it rose to $8 as Yuanxing, Dachen, Dafa, Yongyifeng, Hengchangyong, Hengyu, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, and Yongtian Fengyong competed to buy it. The January American dollar at .375 was also difficult to settle, and it rose to $8. Hengyu, Yuqingyong, and Yongtuo retreated to $4.43, while Dakang, Xianghe, and Shangna rose to $6. Citibank sold November American dollars at .25, and the sale of strips by Yicheng, Bingxing, Hengyu, Dachen, Fuxingyong, and Yongyifeng struggled, but still retreated to $2.50. Yuankang, Xiang Bingxing, Hengyu, Dafa, and Yongyong entered the strip. However, although the Hongxingyong, Yuandingkang, and Yongtuo were small, they were still frustrated. Bingxing, Dafa, and Yongfuyu, Dakang, and others bought the strip together, gradually rising to over $5. Yongli, Dafa, and Yongfu An sold the strips repeatedly, although frustrated, but the exchange market still had supply from the banks, and finally it retreated to $2. Hengyu once entered to $3.50, but Fuan, Daxingyong, Yuanchangyong, and Dingchangyifengyong still came to compete for sales, and the selling suddenly intensified and retreated to $20. However, there were still many buyers taking advantage of the low price, and Dingkang and others slightly replenished, rising to $2.70. The general trend was uncertain. Dalian Bang Hengyu and others sold slightly, and the closing price at noon fell again to $921.10. After the market closed, Hengxing suddenly sold and fell, and sentiment also became tired, and it retreated into $20 again.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $919. Citibank bought American dollars for November at .375, and HSBC bought half a yuan for January. Zhaofeng Changdaxingyong entered to $20.50, Fuxingyong sold out, and retreated to $19.50. Daxingyong, Hengtaiyuqingyong entered again, and the bank had quite a large appetite, rising to $21.40. The price of gold went up 8 annas in Bombay, and Dafa, Yongheng Yu, Fuan, Yuankang, and Xiang and others sold slightly, and the downward trend started suddenly, falling to $18.60. Qianchang, Xiang, Zhaofeng Chang, Dingkang, Fuxingyong, and others joined hands and rose to $22.50 in steps. Hua Bi came out with American dollars for December at .375, Hengxing and Dachen sold out, and fell to $20.02, but the bank was still selling shillings, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yongfeng Hengyu, Wan Yu and others entered, and rose to $2.1. Mitsui came out with American dollars for January at .4375, Yuanxing Hengxing, Yongli Yifengyong let go, and retreated to .02, Citibank bought American dollars for December at .8125, the situation was still stable, Yongli, Yuanmao, Yongyuanchang Yong and others bought in slightly, rising to $2.5, but the trend was uncertain, and the volatility was very fast, and the rise and fall in Bombay was the same, making it difficult to determine the gold market, Fengyong and others sold out, and the closing price retreated to $921.20. After the market closed, although Fengyong and Fuchang sold, Yuanmao Yongyuan, Yiyuan Jiyong, and Wanxing and others bought in slightly, gradually rising to over $2. The highest price of the day was $928 and the lowest price was $915, for a total of $13. As a result, it rebounded $1.60 from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The new standard for December was mediocre. The morning opening also fell $4.60 to $915. Transactions were sluggish. The afternoon closing rose to $921.10. The afternoon market opened at $919, and the market conditions were flat, extending to the closing price, which was also listed at $921.20. The highest price of the day was $921.20 and the lowest was $915, for a difference of $6.20. As a result, it rebounded $1.60 from the previous closing. The new chips for December increased to 2,261, with a total of 12 bulls. Wanxing had the most. There were 13 shorts, Zhengchang had the most.</p>
<p>The settlement price for HSBC's American dollar was unchanged at $35.875, equivalent to a speculative gold price of over $964. According to the closing price, it was about $43 less than the previous closing, less than $2 less. The new standard for December was quoted at $1871 by the Central Bank's customs gold, equivalent to a speculative gold price of $950. According to the closing price, it was about $29 less, less than $12 from the previous closing. Registration for the month was $921, the same as November, the same as December. The morning water was $921, and the afternoon water was the same. Red gold was still calculated at $10. The listed price was $925. The gold market rose and fell quickly and changed indefinitely. The Tianjin gang was watching, so there were not many transactions. It was only heard that Dafeng Hengying Fengheng slightly took in a total of about 1,000 taels.

<p>Poor Situation Difficult to Quickly Ameliorate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market still felt sluggish, indeed continuing to trend downward. People's hearts were weak due to the unfavorable environment, such as rampant bandits. However, the trading floor was still dominated by bulls, with considerable upward pulling power. Therefore, although the situation seemed unlikely to improve, it was still difficult to quickly decline due to the relationships on the trading floor, possibly pulling up before falling again. In short, although the environmental situation was not good, there were no significant bad signs, and both bulls and bears had considerable power. The overall future situation should still be a larger range of fluctuation. Yesterday's trading was quite chaotic at the opening, initially declining slightly by one or two jiao. In the middle, various 20-year bonds turned better by two to four jiao, then later returned to a decline of about one or two jiao. The competition between bulls and bears was evident here. In the second session, the leading bonds were slightly better by one or two jiao, but starting with the 20-year bonds, they turned weak again, falling by one to three jiao. At the afternoon opening, large client No. 50 sold heavily, and market prices uniformly trended downward, falling slightly by one to three jiao. At the close, the trading floor had considerable upward pulling power. Except for one or three bonds declining slightly by one or two jiao, the rest all improved by five fen, one jiao to three and a half jiao. In summary, market prices continued to fall by one or two jiao to four and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was about 17 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Significant Decline in New York Stock Market</p>
<p>Sin Fung Company's Wall Street Journal report from New York stated that yesterday (the 1st), the New York stock market fell significantly due to disappointment with President Roosevelt's speech, especially because he did not mention balancing the budget and stabilizing the US dollar. As a result, US bonds were also weak, leading to fatigue in the bond market. However, the most surprising thing yesterday was that the British exchange rate fell to $4.91875, down $0.0425 from the previous closing. It is rumored that the British exchange rate will fall to the old par value of $4.86, and then be stabilized at this level in US dollars. The small exchanges also fell. Chicago wheat fell due to the severe decline in rye, and rye was shaken due to weak foreign markets and fears of further imports. The total daily transaction volume was 620,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed on the left:</p>

<p>Large Discrepancy Between Highs and Lows in Two Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a downward trend that was difficult to reverse. The quoted price for foreign wheat showed continued declines in Chicago, about 8 or 9 jiao, and in Canada, a small 4 fen to 1 jiao or so. Therefore, after the opening, the market sentiment for each month showed a state of being swept away like leaves in a storm, weak and lifeless. It is found that although this situation is mostly affected by the decline in foreign wheat, the bleak domestic consumption is also the main reason for the market's heavy burden and difficulty in rebounding. Looking back at the highest record two months ago (i.e., August 8), the huge drop is enough for those operating inside and outside the industry to think carefully. Yesterday, the lowest price for this month was 3.28 yuan, which is a huge difference of 1.45 yuan from the highest price. Yesterday's lowest price for November was 3.36 yuan, which is a difference of 1.36 yuan from the highest price. The difference for November was 1.35 yuan, and the difference for December was 1.24 yuan. In less than two months, the difference in fluctuations has opened up new views since the exchange was established. It can be seen that the rise and fall of prices must be natural. All artificial creations are not what speculation should involve. The result of one day was a uniform heavy decline due to increased selling pressure and weak buying power. This month fell by 8 fen, November fell by 9 fen, December fell by 6 fen, January fell by 5 fen, and February fell by 1 jiao. Due to each factory not needing it, current wheat has not yet opened, it is said.</p>
<p>The continued decline in New York wheat prices for one day caused better buying, but the quantity was not large. The possibility of importing miscellaneous grains from abroad is still a force that influences prices.</p>

<p>Passenger Xian Rice Sales Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign passenger Xian rice market was still active. Inland areas specifically purchased passenger Xian polished rice and coarse rice. Local streets inquired about foreign-imported passenger Xian rice. Recently, the arrival of foreign rice has not been strong. Newly arrived Wenzhou Xian rice will be gradually sold. Therefore, after activity in the inland areas, the market has already seen an increase of 3 to 5 fen. Throughout the day, 400 packages of machine-milled rice, 1,000 packages of polished rice, and 74 packages of coarse rice went from the local area to inland areas. 64 packages of Hankou polished rice and 500 packages of Wenzhou machine-milled rice were sold. 130 packages of Hankou coarse rice went from the local area.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice ship "Qimin Mala" newly arrived with 24,329 packages (this ship carried more than 40,000 packages in total. After unloading in Shanghai, it went to Ningbo to unload). There will be a French company ship arriving in port the day after tomorrow with 50,000 packages. However, this batch of goods must be sold as unbonded goods. Yesterday, the local market trading was slightly active, so the market was able to stabilize. The Unified Market Office sold 1,300 packages of No. 1 Saigon rice at a price of 10.05 yuan to 10.03 yuan, and 100 packages of small grain at a price of 10.04 yuan. Future foreign rice importers are watching and waiting. Foreign merchants telegraphed that the loaded goods were priced at 4.60 yuan to 4.55 yuan, but there were no transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Autumn Rain River Rice Arrival Source Not Strong <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from various Shanghai South gangs were especially scarce, with only 15 or 16 boats in total (totaling over 2,000 dan of goods). The market situation was quite tight at first, and the situation seemed to be rising. Unexpectedly, there were few buyers in the later market, and the sales route became stagnant, resulting in a decline in the overall trend. Although the weather was rainy and the arrival of goods was not high, the result, like the inferior and medium-quality new rice, echoed each other and ultimately formed a firm situation. Thick new Japonica rice was similar. However, the market state of new Du Yangjian, Jiaobaijian, etc., although stable, seemed to be more relaxed. The market shape of various broken rice was still chaotic, with prices varying according to the customers' wishes. Prices varied, with no honor or disgrace. New Yin Yuan continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 21 or 22 boats arrived in the Shanghai North River area. The early market price of West New Japonica rice was raised by one jiao, but the price rebounded by one or two jiao in the evening market due to unsatisfactory sales. The price of East New Japonica rice was called up by two jiao compared to the previous price, but the sales market was extremely dull. The price of Bian Yuan was one jiao short. The price of new Yangjian and new Dujian was stable. The rest of the goods were weak.</p>

<p>Silk Exported Only to Indian Merchants</p>
<p>The demand for Indian Double Palace silk has not weakened, and exports are still not weak. Yesterday morning, the British mail ship "Rawalpindi" exported 42 pieces of Double Palace silk, transshipped to Bombay. Although telegraphs for Yellow and White Factory Silk were sent out yesterday morning to European and American merchants, the market atmosphere was calm. Yesterday, only Indian merchants imported 20 packages of Yellow and White coarse silk.</p>

<p>Road Zhuang needle eyebrow, Xiu Mei green tea, European sales slightly active. Yesterday, Xiehe, Duddell, Jardine Matheson, Fooksz and other firms reopened due to demand from telegrams from Morocco. However, the amount was small, and the ship sales continued to decline. As for Zhen Mei green tea, the market turned stagnant again yesterday. Transactions for Pearl Tea and Gongxi and other goods were still sparse. The future of green tea is extremely bleak. There was no major progress in Qi Ning and other road black teas, but the inventory of black tea on the market is no more than 5,000 or 6,000 boxes, and the situation has stabilized, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Piece Goods - Herringbone Wool is Selling <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The sales of herringbone wool are now increasing daily because the weather has suddenly turned cold, and the sales season has arrived. Many people are hitting the foreign firms for orders every day. It is a pity that the selling price is still weak. McGaw, Mackenzie &amp; Lyall, Fung Chang Ming, and their ordinary herringbone wool, wholesale, are all sold cheaply at 2.75 yuan. Selected colors in whole pieces are 2.80 yuan. Upon investigation, their own set price is uniformly 2 shillings 8 pence. Most of them were priced at 1 shilling 3 or 4 pence when they were settled, so each box opened had to lose an average of 20 to 30 yuan. Therefore, the shopkeepers with ample funds are unwilling to sell them all at once. Their vision is still to see the later market turn better.</p>

<p>British Steel Plates Selling Well in Tianjin Again</p>
<p>Although the new goods of British steel plates, which had been deserted for many days, arrived one after another, the Tianjin gang's business suddenly started. Therefore, many have been opened in recent days. Although the market has not seen progress, the firm state is not what it used to be. Although there was continuous autumn rain yesterday, there were still 500 to 600 dan of transactions. It is heard that the Qingdao and Yantai gangs also have a hand in it, so the trend is quite optimistic.</p>

<p>The scarce bottom of 90-pound US tinplate single connections has long been recorded in this newspaper. However, in recent times, the purchasers are becoming more prosperous, resulting in even less market goods for distribution. Therefore, the market is becoming more trendy. It is estimated that each box is 16.25 yuan, up 1 jiao compared to the previous price, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Japan's Second Step Policy <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper report, on the third anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the Nagoya Shimbun in Japan published a commentary entitled "The Asian Continent Construction Project Has Entered the North China Work Period of the Second Step." This article discussed the past aggression against Korea and Manchuria, and the steps to annex our country in the future. The Japanese ambition is completely exposed.</p>
<p>The commentary begins by saying: "Today is the third anniversary of the Manchurian Incident. What we feel in our hearts is that Japan's mission for the Asian continent policy is permanent and significant." It continues: "As for the mission of the Asian continent, it is entirely tied to our Japanese people. Since the Manchurian Incident occurred, it has been the time to realize our mission." Although there are only a few words, the entire Japanese nation's conspiracy against us has been frankly publicized, which is enough to awaken the delusions of the people.</p>
<p>"The construction work of Manchuria is gradually becoming smooth. At the same time, Japan hopes that the political work in North China will also become more coordinated. That is, Japan has now taken another step and is standing in the period of political work in North China. In other words, we have encountered the period of the second continental construction project." This is another very straightforward expression. Here, he tells us that Japan's continental policy has not only achieved initial success, but has also entered the second stage. Regarding Japan's continental policy, it is impossible for outsiders to know how many stages they are divided into.</p>
<p>The article also says: "But the great mission that Japan bears on the Asian continent, although it has started with the creation of Manchuria, cannot be said to have fulfilled its responsibilities. We should take the entire China and the entire Asia as our goals, and strive for cultural and economic unity and harmony. From the cause of creating Manchuria, we will promote it to the mainland of China, so that it will have the same sympathy and feelings as the Japanese people and become an inseparable relationship. This is our greatest ideal for Manchuria." These sentences are written even more vividly. I wonder what the people of our country will think when they see them?</p>
<h3 id="e252">Moonlight Night <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— TT</p>
<p>The night is deathly quiet.</p>
<p>The moon hangs high in the clear sky, sending intermittent firecracker sounds from afar, vaguely vibrating in my ears.</p>
<p>The desolation here is more like a ghost realm than the ruins after a war. Living in this ghost realm, I occupy a bean-sized area on the earth, but I dare not believe that I am still a member of the world, because everything here makes me doubt the existence of life.</p>
<p>I have been here for about two months. In these two months, except for necessary outings, I have been hiding in this broken and old hut all day long; either sleeping or sitting blankly. Sometimes I also fulfill my bad habit, and start pacing. While pacing, I recite a poem I have always liked by Huang Zhongze, "Nine out of ten people deserve a scornful look, a hundred useless things is a scholar." Tired, I fell back on the straw mat spread on the ground, my bed, closed my eyelids, and reality, disappeared in my dreams.</p>
<p>Tonight, the moon is exceptionally round, and a few more firecrackers can be heard from afar, I guess it is the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Every festival makes me miss my relatives even more, and haven’t I always been like this? Of course, in my actions this time, I have fully demonstrated that I am a heartless and unfeeling person, but for this, I don’t know how many tears I have shed secretly. It was not until the day I had to leave that I painfully left my old home.</p>
<p>Mentioning the day I left home, besides crying loudly, what other way can I save the pain in my heart?</p>
<p>A cold morning. The sun had just emerged from the mountain peak. Except for the little birds on the locust tree branches in front of the courtyard, singing their morning songs, the earth was so silent. The alarm clock on the desk woke me up. I got out of bed with sleepy eyes, stretched my neck and looked out the window. I was shocked. The color of the sky told me it was already late. I hurriedly put on my clothes, took a rattan bag, bid farewell to my bedroom, and walked straight to the outer room, but as soon as I stepped out of the door, my calves seemed to soften, and a burst of sadness and tears rolled down uncontrollably. I guessed that they had discovered my sudden departure from the family without telling them, and I wondered how sad they would be. The faces of my mother crying with swollen eyes, and my younger siblings shedding tears appeared immediately before my eyes, but for myself, I finally gritted my teeth, endured the piercing pain, and resolutely walked towards the pier by the river. From that day until now, I have cut off all contact with my family. Under the moonlight tonight, I wonder if my younger siblings who are eating mooncakes are still thinking about their missing brother?</p>

<h3 id="e253">It is Not Easy for Parents to Teach Their Children! <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an eighteen-year-old youth who has received higher education and now works in a bookstore. Life is not comfortable, but not very difficult either. Recently, I have been feeling a kind of distress due to conflicts in opinions within the family. Therefore, I am writing to you, sir, to ask you to help me resolve it.</p>
<p>The fact is this: I have parents, who are both around forty years old. I am their only son, so they love me very much. Their minds are not overly corrupt, but they are not new either; they are also extremely conservative. And since I am a young man, influenced by the environment, my thoughts are relatively radical, and I like movement and dislike stillness. Therefore, in our thoughts and actions, we have different opinions everywhere. I am also young and competitive, and often engage in great theoretical disputes when discussing a certain issue. Although the result is often that I yield and tolerate it, sometimes I have disregarded my parents’ advice and done things according to my own wishes. In this way, not only are they very angry, but I am also very painful. I often think this: I should be more patient with my parents, why bother arguing about reason? But whenever their thoughts and behaviors are incorrect (for example, they are very superstitious), I can't help but say a few words to persuade them and correct their mistakes. But as a result, they scold me instead, but their reasons are incorrect and without any basis.</p>
<p>Also, I like to talk with friends or participate in some gatherings among friends, but my parents always stop me, saying that I am wasting time and energy; and that in this era of declining morals and treacherous people, making friends is very dangerous; a careless influence from the outside world will lead to the path of depravity. But I know that my friends are very upright and honest. Not only is there no harm in them, but I can also get a lot of knowledge among those friends. Therefore, disputes often arise, and I am very distressed in spirit. Sir: If you ask me to submit to everything and completely follow my parents’ wishes, it seems too difficult to endure; but if I follow my own will and resist the family, I feel that it is wrong, and there is no need or reason to resist. How should I resolve this issue? Please give me a guide. I think there must be many young people in the world who are in the same situation as me. Sincerely, I wish you good health. Junyan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: What Junyan has raised is a common problem of family ideological conflict. On the parents’ side, they think they are very protective of their children, but because they cannot understand the nature of young people, they often excessively interfere in their children’s thoughts and actions because they love them too much, resulting in a kind of opposite result. The editor believes that this issue is a very important issue of family education and is worthy of open discussion. I hope that readers will speak out as much as possible on behalf of either the parents or the children.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Uncle's Braid (II)(I) <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In the heart of the second master, he really felt that people like Fengyun were really nosy. Why bother worrying about other people's hair? In fact, he did not know that one day, everyone's braids would be cut off, because he knew that the change from autocracy to the Republic of China was an unstoppable thing, and he also agreed with the republican system. Since the Sino-Japanese War, China has been weak and unable to recover. Perhaps changing a political system will make it stronger. However, he was really reluctant to cut off a black and long braid, and obviously dragging it down would inevitably be ridiculed for not being civilized enough. Therefore, taking care of both sides, only hiding it under the hat was a way. However, his hard work was not easy to understand. Isn't that so? At this time, Brother Fengyun would also say:</p>
<p>"But I don't care about these. Let the Republic of China be good. As for the bird shit about braids, I don't want to hide it."</p>
<p>Brother Fengyun always spoke like this, and Zhizhai had no choice but to hum and hum, and then smile slightly.</p>
<p>Fengyun's profession was collecting cow dung. He didn't dare to delay any longer. He carried his dung basket and prepared to part ways with Zhizhai. The last sentence was:</p>
<p>"Okay, your brothers are from three factions. The eldest brother is a braid, the second brother is a braid on a plate, and the third brother is a monk." He laughed a few times and left. But after taking a few steps, he turned back and said:</p>
<p>"Brother Zhizhai, don't be angry. I'll keep you company. I have to go find cow dung."</p>
<p>Zhizhai watched him leave with a wry smile. He thought: There's really no way to deal with this kind of person.</p>

<p>My heart is filled with worries, remember Xue Song.</p>
<p>He is stationed at the strategic city of Guo Zhou.</p>
<p>Tian Chengsi is close to the Qing, disregarding, intending to attack.</p>
<p>Rumors spread like startled cranes.</p>
<p>They all say feigning passage is secretly an attack.</p>
<p>Xue Song is anxious and helpless.</p>
<p>A female page suddenly appears.</p>
<p>Young, remembers treasure, a maiden.</p>
<p>It is Hongxian who is loyal to her lord.</p>

<p>She withdraws and dresses again.</p>
<p>Instantly, her hair is styled, her spirit like a rainbow.</p>
<p>With a sword at her waist, light as a swallow.</p>
<p>She leaps and her shadow vanishes.</p>
<p>The fortress is heavily guarded with flags.</p>
<p>In an instant, she has crossed countless barriers.</p>
<p>The lights are dim, the watch horns are silent.</p>
<p>The soldiers are half asleep.</p>
<p>Hongxian sneaks into the central tent like a snake or a heron.</p>
<p>She sees him leaning on a pillow, clothed, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>His eight-character birthdate is hidden in a golden box.</p>
<p>Hongxian takes it from beside his pillow and hides it in her bosom.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she places seven decapitated heads into his chest.</p>
<p>A warning, he dares not inspect the troops and show his strength again.</p>
<p>The thousand-mile journey home is not yet dawn.</p>
<p>She will calmly report her clever plan.</p>
<p>Frightened, he dares not cross the Leichi Lake east of the mountains.</p>

<p>Golden wind and jade dew, a cool autumn breeze,</p>
<p>Sweet osmanthus blossoms in full bloom, fragrant.</p>
<p>All sounds are silent, the sky is still,</p>
<p>A full moon shines on the eastern wall.</p>
<p>A sentimental person is stifled before the window,</p>
<p>Thinking of my sister, my heart aches.</p>
<p>Remembering the deep affection we shared in the past,</p>
<p>How can one not feel sorrow?</p>
<p>Sister, I truly hoped to be with you forever,</p>
<p>To happily grow old together in a peaceful haven.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this change occurred halfway,</p>
<p>Scattering the loving mandarin ducks in sorrow.</p>
<p>I ordered the children to buy aloeswood,</p>
<p>To carve your beautiful face from when you were alive.</p>
<p>It is difficult to carve your bright and lively eyes,</p>
<p>Difficult to carve your chaste and graceful figure.</p>
<p>Difficult to carve you embroidering mandarin ducks under the window during the day,</p>
<p>Difficult to carve you sitting alone reading *Romance of the Western Chamber* by the lamp.</p>
<p>Difficult to carve us enjoying flowers and drinking fragrant wine together,</p>
<p>Difficult to carve us playing chess, each claiming victory.</p>
<p>Difficult to carve your virtuous and capable goodness,</p>
<p>Difficult to carve your gentle voice and fragrant breath.</p>
<p>Difficult to carve your captivating beauty,</p>
<p>Difficult to carve our intimate words in the boudoir.</p>
<p>Sister, now I don't think about food or drink all day,</p>
<p>In my lovesick dreams, I meet you in your finery.</p>
<p>My pillow is cold, my quilt empty, I cannot sleep,</p>
<p>Grieving the cold wind and rain.</p>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival,</p>
<p>Red candles shine brightly, and incense is lit again.</p>
<p>I respectfully invite you, sister, to sit in the place of honor,</p>
<p>Your younger brother accompanies you by your side.</p>
<p>Several plates of fruits you loved when you were alive,</p>
<p>Mooncakes, shortbread, and more.</p>
<p>Pears and water chestnuts were your favorites,</p>
<p>A branch of tender reed, white as frost.</p>
<p>I offer a cup of fragrant tea with both hands,</p>
<p>Sister, please have some snacks and tea in my room.</p>
<p>Sister, when you had a minor illness,</p>
<p>I tirelessly sought doctors and medicine.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the illness was incurable,</p>
<p>Your beautiful face and jade bones buried in the tomb.</p>
<p>Your last words still engraved in my heart,</p>
<p>I am filled with sorrow and tears.</p>
<p>You said that after you pass away,</p>
<p>I must diligently study under the window.</p>
<p>Make a name for yourself,</p>
<p>Marry a beautiful woman like a flower.</p>
<p>And keep you in my heart,</p>
<p>Sister, since you left this world,</p>
<p>My eyes are filled with tears all day long.</p>
<p>I have no heart to read or write,</p>
<p>Nor do I think of a wedding night.</p>
<p>After I complete three years of mourning,</p>
<p>I will shave my head and chant Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>So that we may be together again in the next life.</p>

<h3 id="e260">The Reputation of Stars Is the Prison of Stars (Part Two) <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jia Bo</p>
<p>Jasu Pitts said: "Von Stroheim thought I could perform, but many people laughed when they saw me on the screen for the first time. That laughter built high walls around me, making it impossible for me to escape. From then on, I became a prisoner of all my facial and hand expressions. This was not only true in my career, but also in my private life, where I was subjected to an invisible restriction. I have never attended any banquets. In four years, I have never bought a dinner gown, because I already have a reputation for being 'ugly'. They don't invite me to banquets either. I also prefer to stay at home and play with the kids to avoid their harsh criticisms. Children don't criticize me harshly. They don't think I'm ugly, but think I'm beautiful. They never laugh at me, but laugh with me."</p>
<p>Greta Garbo is also a prisoner deeply confined in a mysterious jail. The walls created by her mysterious reputation are even stronger than ancient castles. If Garbo were to break free from her chains and try to escape from this prison, bugles would sound, guards would rise up, and she would be surrounded, making it impossible for her to escape. Therefore, she has to live in seclusion, not allowed to casually go to other studios besides her own to chat with other colleagues, not allowed to joke and laugh arbitrarily, and not allowed to stroll casually down the streets of Hollywood.</p>
<p>Irene Dunne said: "I am also a prisoner of professional thought or professional reputation. They all think I am a perfect woman, as if I would faint if I heard an immoral word, or cover my nose with a handkerchief when I encountered someone drinking. In fact, I often want to hear people's jokes and laugh heartily. I can also drink a cocktail in appropriate settings. But I am too burdened by this 'good reputation.'" The opposite of Irene Dunne's situation is Mae West, with her hourglass figure. Her good reputation is entirely that of a harlot, because she is good at playing lewd women on screen. Over time, her prison has been built and cannot be broken. In fact, West does not drink or smoke, nor does she attend night banquets. She is a proper housewife. Of course, she is definitely not like what you see on screen, often luring men to her home for a visit.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most severely imprisoned is Janet Gaynor. There is probably no chance for her to escape from her prison forever. Once, a female reporter visited Janet. At that time, Janet had just been married to Lydell Peck not long ago. She saw the reporter and said happily in the conversation that she really wanted to have a child. The reporter thought it was a very common thing, and every virtuous wife always wants to have a baby after marrying a man. Unexpectedly, after the reporter returned home, she received a call from the film company asking her not to publish Janet's words about having a child in the newspaper. The reporter said that it is a very common thing for women to have children, so why aren't they even allowed to publish that hope in the newspaper? But the people in the company said: "That's not allowed. If you publish those words, her reputation will be ruined. She will always be a little girl. She is youth. She is sweetness. She is glory. She must not come into contact with everything in life. The matter of having children is especially out of the question!" Recently, rumors have been spreading that Janet suddenly had an affair with a married man. Everyone is whispering in panic, as if Hollywood would collapse if that were confirmed.</p>
<p>Slice White once said sadly: "I am a prisoner, probably a prisoner for life! I am forever imprisoned under the infamous name of 'gold digger', and I cannot break free. It's really strange. But I am a good housekeeper, and I recently demonstrated my cooking skills in front of five hundred women. I can knit Afghan sweaters. I can make Italian noodles. I can steam cocoa cakes better than anyone else. I know how to save money. I arrive at the studio on time and am never late. I also don't have any dealings with male colleagues. But, in the eyes of people in the world, I am still a dazzling and unattainable blonde dangerous woman."</p>
<p>The above are all common prisoners. Valentino became an Aheilr for life. Irene Dunne is an eternally perfect woman. Janet Gaynor is a little sister who will never grow up. Mae West is an incorrigible siren. Slice White is a woman who values money and not reputation. Garbo is always a solitary walker. Each of them is individually imprisoned in a room, isolated, so that their characteristics will never be mixed and adulterated! (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e261">Review of *The Line Up* <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Line Up - Cathay</p>
<p>From all aspects, we cannot give this film a higher evaluation, because it is just a mediocre detective film.</p>
<p>However, the theme adopted here is relatively fresh. The playwright placed a group of clothes-stealing thieves, along with a woman, and this woman fell in love with a detective. As a result, the gang of thieves was solved, and the woman and the detective went on a sweet trip. The mediocrity of the story can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The director's technique has a fairly bright tone and progresses smoothly. Especially the last part, when the two detectives searched the clothing store and had not yet discovered the secret organization, due to appropriate editing, the tense and funny atmosphere was indeed very good.</p>
<p>The acting skills of the actors, when reviewed individually, have no special merits, but several of the main ones can still develop evenly, at least they can perform the mediocre play in a mediocre way.</p>
<p>That's how it is, the ultimate mediocrity, nothing more.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Film Notes <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Shi</p>
<p>1.  Several types of films that China lacks.</p>
<p>Obviously: Since the "September 18th Incident" and the "January 28th Incident," the two extraordinary events, Chinese films have made very obvious progress due to the rise of national consciousness and the awakening of the film industry itself. At least - those films with gods, monsters, martial arts that are harmful to national thought have disappeared from the film scene.</p>
<p>However, although current Chinese films have made significant progress, they still lack several types of films in terms of quality, such as social education films, children's education films, science films, physiology films, and films that use war as a background to instill military knowledge to the public... Undoubtedly, the above types of films are currently very much needed, but we have not yet heard of a company that will produce the above films. This is truly a very regrettable thing!</p>
<p>2.  Hope the Film Association can be realized soon</p>
<p>Recently, there has been such a rumor in the film industry that eight companies, including so-and-so, intend to organize a film trade association, stipulating that a group meeting will be held once or twice a month to jointly discuss the steps for the progress of film art, and on the other hand, it can also explain the misunderstandings between companies. Indeed: At a time when companies are mutually hostile, fighting each other internally, and the foreign film industry is stepping up its aggression against the Chinese film front, the establishment of a film trade association is most urgently needed.</p>
<p>3.  The Physical Health of Stars</p>
<p>The poor physical health of Chinese film stars (including male and female stars) is indeed an undeniable fact, except for a few who are willing to exercise.</p>
<p>We know that with a healthy body, we can have a sound career, and working in films is more likely to damage the body than other jobs. The separation of day and night, the disharmony of hot and cold, and the endless working hours, if you do not have a healthy body to resist, eventually your body will become weaker and more ill. Your great future will be buried in a weak and sickly body.</p>
<p>Chinese film stars, I hope you will not be obsessed with those handball courts or dance halls that are harmful to money and body after work. You should use this spare time to work hard to exercise and enrich your physical health. Look! The reason why every star in Hollywood is so healthy is the reward they get for being willing to exercise!</p>

<p>— Bo Zhong</p>
<p>Wan Laitian, who once served as director of Mingxing, Shenzhou, Great China, Minxin, and Lianhua companies, has been working hard in Sichuan for film culture movement with his friend Zhao Chuan since directing the film "Heartache." Because of the barriers of mountains and rivers, news is not communicated, so for two or three years, the news has been silent.</p>
<p>Currently, Wan has founded a film school and a drama troupe in Sichuan. The film school has more than 400 students. Recently, Wan and Ms. Huang Hou organized Datong Film Company, and the debut work is "Under Mount Emei." The purpose of the play is to expose the dark side of politics in Sichuan. The subject matter is extremely realistic and touching. The exterior scenes have been filmed in Sichuan, and the interior scenes are inconvenient due to material aspects, so they came to Shanghai to shoot them the day before yesterday. The female lead is Ms. Huang Hou. Huang is a graduate of Shanghai Tsinghua Art College and has profound attainments in film and drama.</p>

<p>— Fan</p>
<p>···The upcoming blockbuster "Deep in the Red Chamber" has a scene of Xishi picking lotuses, with the actress Lu Lixia singing and dancing. Before entering the film industry, Lu was a dance professor at the Jimei Dance Troupe. She has a very deep understanding of singing, so the results are extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>……In the sound film "Renzhu" (i.e., Empty Valley Orchid), there is a "hypnotic song" with simple lyrics and a melodious tune, which has the same effect as the "lullaby" in "Zhilan Girl." The song has been published in the New Garden on the 3rd of this month. The author is Gao Tianqi, and the singer is the heroine Miss Fan Xuepeng.</p>
<p>……Cui En, who plays Fan Xuepeng's son in "Renzhu," is only seven years old. Although he is on camera for the first time, his acting talent is comparable to that of a group of famous child stars.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Fero heard Sykes' words and, believing them to be true, took him to find Banjo. Sykes entered the station and suddenly wanted to send a telegram to the New York newspaper, so he discussed it with Fero, waiting for them in the telegraph room, and told the other two robbers to go and find Banjo. Here, Sykes moved a typewriter from the ground, inserted a piece of paper, and started typing a news report, reporting the true situation of Banjo and his gang of robbers retaking Laconsi Boarding. At this time, Banjo and his subordinates Thomas and Waltis were in a looted shop. They had captured seven women there, and Banjo was inspecting them one by one. He looked at them with a playful smile, and they all wanted to please Banjo, letting him flirt with them. However, when Banjo flirted with the fifth woman, the woman showed a disgusted look. Banjo asked her what her name was. She said her name was Lucinda. Banjo said, "What's the matter? Are you afraid of me? You don't need to be afraid. I am very loyal." As he spoke, he reached out to pinch her fair face. Unexpectedly, the woman became enraged and slapped Banjo in the face. Banjo shouted, "Oh, good, Thomas, I want this one. Lucinda, come with me. Don't you want to provoke me?" He pulled her hand hard and hugged her. Lucinda kept slapping him in the face. Thomas came over and gently picked her up. Lucinda shouted, "If you want me, you should marry me. I won't go with a thief!" At this moment, Waltis walked up to Banjo and reported that Fero was looking for him, and someone wanted to see him in the telegraph room at the station. Banjo ordered Waltis to help Thomas. Lucinda kept shouting at Banjo, "If you want me, you must marry me!" Banjo turned around and scolded, "Bullshit!" and walked away.</p>
<p>Banjo walked into the telegraph room, and Fero nodded at Sykes, who was typing. Banjo walked behind Sykes, watching him type. At this time, the paper read: "Laconsi Boarding, Mexico, August 15th. The bandit army, led by the outlaw Banjo Villa, suddenly invaded this place today. After the bandits arrived, they burned and looted everywhere, and the entire territory was looted. The atrocities of rape and murder are unspeakable..." Sykes was typing when he suddenly looked up and saw a bloated and clumsy ugly man, and asked, "Are you Banjo Villa?" Banjo Villa said, "Yes." Sykes quickly covered the paper on the typewriter and shouted, "Don't look, don't look. I have to rewrite it." Banjo stretched out a thick and fat finger and pointed to a word on the paper, "Is this my name? Hmm, my name, Banjo Villa? What else does it say?" Sykes heard this and breathed a sigh of relief, saying, "What? Can't you read? What it says above is probably reporting how your brave brothers overcame the central army, as well as your personal genius, etc." Banjo said, "Is this what you wrote to America?" Sykes said, "Of course, six million people can't eat breakfast every morning without reading my news." Banjo scratched his head and said, "This is too short. Can't you write more?" Sykes was happy to hear this and said, "Oh, if you can find a way to get your brothers to take a walk outside, my mind can work more peacefully." Banjo heard this and immediately ordered everyone to go outside. Sykes said again, "I can't write well without wine. That person robbed my wine." Banjo immediately snatched the bottle of wine back and gave it to Sykes, then said, "You tell the Americans that Banjo Villa is not afraid of death." (To be continued)</p>
