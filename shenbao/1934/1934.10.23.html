<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲金本位國家集團之新陣容　素</h3>
<p>法荷比意及瑞士。是目前世界僅存的五大金本位國家他們在這通貨膨脹運動奔騰世界的時期中。怎樣能砥柱中流。仍然不改變黄金的面目必定有好些的學者們。都認爲這是今天的一個奇蹟。但我們如稍稍檢查一下便覺得他們玩法弄賓的用意。原也和英美日那些勵行通貨膨脹運動的國家。在本質上没有什麽不同。他們儘管在名義上不去追隨英美日的後塵。實際却正是依樣葫蘆藉着「金本位」的維持。爲爭取市塲的武器那種手段確是毫無二致的。</p>
<p>法荷比意及瑞士五大金本位國。日昨曾根據比外長賈斯巴的提議。於比京不魯塞耳簽定了一種議定書。議定書的内容。有三點値得我們注意。第一重行確定維持各關係國貨幣現在黄金成分的政策第三關於各關係間之貨物交換。則期望能依一九三三年七月一日以後。一年度間的實際貿易額爲根據。增加百分之十。第三關於游歷及運輸事業。俟作成詳細報告再行討論。從這三點内容看。我們已知道這五大金本位國家。是企圖走向以若干「同類」國家爲基礎的經濟集團主義更高度的方面去這個意義是顯示些什麽呢。</p>
<p>誰都知道目前全世界。自一九二九年以來。除蘇俄尙能依據兩次五年計劃抬高國民生産以外。其餘幾於没有一國不是陷於焦頭爛額的境地因此貿易數量收縮。資本利潤减少。便都成了驅使那些列强國家。不能不作更尖鋭的經濟戰爭的基本原因。在這個形勢之下。便産生了什麽「金鎊集團」。「美金集團」。及「金本位集團一諸經濟單位依據這個「結聯多數與國」的原則。便能使一般列强國家從末運中又漸漸抬起頭來。五大國家要進一步作戰。當然不能脱這個方法。這便是五大金本位國家議定書的第一點表示。其次。五大金本位國家的議定書。還表示一點對於英美通貨膨脹運動的反攻。英美在白銀運動之下。對於金本位國家的匯兑。已經一天一天低賤。更因英美諸經濟集團藉通貨膨脹的效力。使生産受着激刺向上。使市塲受着傾銷而擴張。這是對於金本位國家一種更高度的威脅。所以要將這陣綫。重新整理一下。以取反抗英美的攻勢。</p>
<p>最後。這次五大金本位國家議定書。還指示了一點更重要的意義。那就是經濟戰爭的尖鋭已更深一層。在五大金本位國家之間。如果實際貿易額要擴張十分之一。則惟有將定量輸入制更加擴大來應用才有可能。現在不但貿易要受着如此嚴厲的限制。就是旅行以及運輸事業。亦須經過統制政策。這種如神經網般的作戰計劃。怎樣不令人緊張起來呢。五大金本位國家。對於其他關係列强作這樣的回答。我們對於其前途。是不能不格外注意的。</p>

<h3>日增海軍比率英美一致表反對</h3>
<p>傳英有接受總噸位制意</p>
<p>日英初步談判今日開始</p>
<p>（倫敦）　海軍談話舉行之時、英國大槪將竭力反對日本或其他國家動議改變現在之軍艦比率制、而代以總噸位制、因總噸位制將使英國大爲不利也、美國專家亦謂、總噸位制實行之後、美國將集中全力建造大型戰艦·重巡洋艦·及航空母艦、此則英日兩國皆所反對、故倫敦秦晤士報及觀察報近來發表論文、謂英國或可接受總噸位制、以解除比率問題之困難、衆皆表示驚異、英國海軍當局則謂、無論此種論調之意義如何、終不能表明英國可允日本增加比率、據稱、英美代表皆以爲日本因地理關係、比較安全、故其海軍比率自應稍低、再英國已久擬添造高速度之巡艦、聞七月中麥唐納首相確曾聲明、華盛頓及倫敦條約滿期之後、英國將增加巡艦五十至七十艘、惟如美國在總噸位制之下專造巨艦、則英國亦將不致囿於局勢、而建造不需要之軍艦云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>英意見分兩派</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　日本關於海軍問題之要求業由山本少將向報界説明槪要、一俟英日兩國間單獨談話正式開始時、山本少將并當詳細説明、此項談話頃定明晨十一時三十分舉行、由首相麥唐納主席、目前英國輿論對於日本海軍所要求各節、已有兩派不同之意見、一卽政界人士務欲避免海軍軍備競爭、其態度傾於妥恊、一卽海軍部方面、則决堅反對有所讓步、此外美國方面對於日本海軍之野心、亦表示敵對之意、其結果將使英國海軍部人士愈益堅决、則以該部人士除關於技術問題之見解而外、尙有盎格魯撒克遜民族當在太平洋上維持聯帶關係之政治的見解、必因此而愈益振有辭故也、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　帝國政府於倫敦初步談判開始時、卽將向英美提議新軍縮方針、向締結新軍縮條約邁進、然此次提議之新軍縮方針公佈與否、外務海軍兩當局並全權間業已議妥、决定方針如下、</p>

<p>（東京）　近來日本國内外盛傳日本已洞視軍縮會議之决裂、將於决裂後向英美提議締結不侵略條約、前駐意大使代表廣田外相赴歐美之任務亦當在此、然際此軍縮初步談判將開始之時、恐此傳説被利用爲牽制之具、外務省將於今日發表非公式聲明、否認此説、謂日本决在一九三六年杪以後、脱離華盛頓條約之束縛、又决在此次軍縮初步談判提出新軍縮案、期能締結新海約、外傳將於會議决裂後擬向英美提議締結政治條約、但日政府實無此種準備云、（二十二日華聯電）</p>

<p>（一）發欵方法之問題、日本方面力主以日本銀行團作保證已屬充分、該大使則主張對於現欵及物價之擔保、應以取得公債爲要、（二）接收問題、日方對於除去領事館及其附屬物品雖與同意、而對於病院俱樂部圖書館等項不得認爲除外、該大使則主張領事館以外之附屬物應歸所有、（三）借貸對象表問題、日方主張以三月以後之借貨對象表、認爲有絶對必軍、該大使則謂以本年三月提出之部分已足、且現實之借貸狀態均爲「滿洲國」方面所知悉者也、（四）商品付欵之期間問題、日方主張三年半、蘇聯方面主張以二年半爲期、（五）條約製成之問題、恊定成立之際製成條約全文、以日蘇「滿」三國文字爲主、倘條文上發生疑義時、當以日本語爲根據、對於此點雙方意見表示一致云云、（二十二日日聯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　據報載狄耶普（在法國北部衣袖海邊）地方又捕獲一人、名阿爾都閣維區、係馬賽兇案從犯之一、生於一八八九年携帶匈牙利護照、其上所書之名卽爲阿爾都閣維區、乃恐怖團體「瓦斯達查斯」團最危險分子之一、其人犯案甚多、在奥國曾攻擊向南斯拉夫開行之國際列車、刦車時有共同犯二人、一爲波斯比希、卽此次因馬賽案在法國被捕者、一爲喀瓦特爾尼克、卽此次因馬賽案在意大利被捕者、阿爾者閣維區曾被判處監禁十個月、最近渠在倫敦、法國警察特向英國總偵緝機關「蘇格蘭塲」交涉、始被驅逐出境、渡海來法之際、遂被逮捕、渠於一九三三年十二月十四日至一九三四年十月間所作何事、調查之後當可了然、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（意大利都林城　意國警察對於克羅特恐怖主義團體領袖柏夫里區及卡瓦特爾尼克二人被捕詳情、始終拒絶宣布、法國馬賽預審推事要求將二人引渡至法候審、大約當候數星期後始可辦到、緣意國法律雖曾規定謀害外國元首及政治家之罪、足爲引渡之理由、但須經上訴法庭决定之後、司法部長始可允准、此項手續頗需時日故也、按柏卡二人隱性埋名、匿居米蘭都林兩地、意國警察於接到法國警察無綫電之後、不出四十八小時卽將二人捕獲到案、其敏捷殊堪欽佩、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（意大利都林城）意大利官廳審訊克羅地族恐怖主義團體領袖柏夫里區、及卡瓦特爾尼克二人、結果對於參預馬賽兇案一節、全部否認、謂彼等並未發出任何命令、不往法國已歷多年、卽與在法國被捕諸人亦素昧平生云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（貝爾格勒）此間各報爲國王亞歷山大遇害事、對意國抨擊甚力、如凡里門報云、法國密探在都林仍未能一見被捕之嫌疑犯柏夫立區及卡瓦特尼克二人、巴勞達報亦云、意國對於馬賽慘案之偵查、實屬有意作梗云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫公使向匈要求恊助緝凶</h3>
<p>（匈京）　南斯拉夫駐匈公使、頃口頭向外交部提出要求、囑將克羅特族亡命之徒、凡有參加馬賽兇案之嫌疑者、加以偵緝拘捕、匈國政府當卽進行調查、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>用金集團宣言引起幣價波動</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　用金國維持其貨幣金成分之宣言、乃今晨佛郎與美元價格漲起之原因、但英鎊之低落、衆認爲僅屬暫時事、蓋比京議定書並未載有互助辦法也、意國紙幣準備金現僅較法定額百分之四十略高、因意國輸出黄金以抵付入超也、再荷蘭减低幣價之運動、似漸佔勢力、聞在比京會議有切實計畫提出者僅法比二國、今日金融時報稱、歐洲任何國家如有抛棄黄金者、勢將加入英鎊團、其結果或將在英鎊旗幟之下使歐洲恢復金本位、中國現正設法欲照日本阿眞延與巴西之步驟加入英團、中政府近日增收銀税之命令、已使匯兑市塲以人爲的方法發生甚劇烈之起落、此殊不利於貿易也云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>美西海岸颶風</h3>
<p>船隻失事交通阻斷</p>
<p>菲島又遭二次襲擊</p>
<p>（西雅圖）　此間今夜被颶風襲擊、颶風速率每小時九十五英里、航務及電報電話交通事業大受損失、航空綫亦停、聞已死十一人、二人因觸斷落之電綫斃命、貨船富樂立達號已擱淺、今晨九時卅分發出呼救電、該船有船員卅二人、麥迪生總統號脱錨飄流港内、汽船哈伐斯特被撞沉落、惟船員二十人游泳至岸獲救、汽船阿留申號及北海文號亦被撞損、此外被風吹毁者有汽船阜勤尼亞號、惟其水手卅人幸皆獲救、漁船一艘有五人落水、祗二人獲救、此外尙有三漁人溺斃、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（馬尼刺）　馬尼刺上次風災共死八十人、至今喘息方定、詎知星期六及星期四馬尼刺南部又以受颶風襲擊聞、馬尼刺上星期雖當颶風之衝、此次則得倖免、颶風於星期六深夜自海面向加拉馬林省進襲、至星期日午風勢最猛、被災各省之交通阻斷、災區之報告寥寥無幾、但聞那加地方至少有四人死於非命、同時估計財産損失已超過一百萬披沙、斐島參院今日通過百萬披沙之風災救濟費、該案現交總督簽署、該案已由衆院通過、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>日學生禁入跳舞塲</h3>
<p>年紅街巷頓形冷落</p>
<p>（東京）　自警廳嚴禁學生出入年紅街巷以來、迄今不過半月、而咖啡館酒排間跳舞塲等處備受打擊者爲數甚夥、尤以學生街作此項營業者更蒙莫大之影響、倘就此支持門面、勢將没落、坐待倒閉已甚明顯、故此輩同業諸商家現已陸續向警視廳呈請改變方針者、截至二十二日如特種飲食店（置有女招待之咖啡店酒排間等之總稱）呈請改爲普通飲食店者已達六百家、學生雖被禁止出入斯途、而商家備受營業上之打擊、亦屬明瞭、同時東京市内之年紅街巷可見從來頗承學生之照顧、迄今亦經明白暴露矣云、（二十二日日聯電）</p>

<p>荷機由爪哇島急起直追</p>
<p>莫理遜伉儷竟中途退出</p>
<p>英軍官吉爾曼墜地喪生</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英澳航空競賽之第三日、有兩事足令人駭異者、一爲莫理遜夫婦因機損退出、一爲史考特與白拉克所駕之機已於今晨十一時零八分飛抵達爾文港、堪稱神遠、所不幸者、其機「彗星號」現須大加修理、能否及時告畢全程、奪得錦標、現成疑問、據史考特語路透訪員稱、引擎一具、在鐵木耳海上受損、故彼等僅以一引擎飛行兩小時半之久云、</p>
<p>居第二位之荷機陶格拉斯號、已於上午十時三十六分飛抵巴達維亞、彼等於七小時前在馬來西北隅之阿洛爾斯太降落、上午四時零七分續發、</p>
<p>飛行四百哩而於七時零二分降落新加坡、於是急從事添油騐機、費去三十二分鐘、旋於七時三十四分復勝空飛往二千零八十四哩外之達爾文港、旣而氣候轉劣而有風雨、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（達爾文港）　英國飛行家史考特及白拉克、在參加英澳長途飛行比賽中最先飛抵此間、飛機引擎二具中、其一業已損壞、據史氏云、引擎係在飛越鐵木耳爾海上時運用不靈、但無論如何仍圖繼續前進、萬一修理不及、則將設法以唯一引擎力量、飛達墨爾鉢云、午後一時三十五分　　（格林維區鐘點）二人業已飛和出向墨爾鉢進發、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國飛行家史考特及白拉克二人、係英澳間長途飛行比賽最迅速之一組、二人業於今晨十二時零八分（格林維區鐘點）飛抵澳洲達爾文港、計由倫敦出發之時起、途中共歷五十二小時三十三分三十秒、較以前澳洲飛行家烏爾姆所造成之紀錄、尤少四天十三小時十一分、假定係循直綫飛行、則其每小時平均速爲二百八十一公里、但二人中途曾停落四次、每次輒踰一小時之多、且飛行亦並不遵循南直綫、故實際上速度不止此數、史白二人現向墨爾鉢斷續飛行、次速者爲荷蘭飛行家阿斯治及格生道費二人、至美國飛行家透納及潘邦二人則已於今晨十時五十一分（格林維區鐘點）飛抵麻拉甲半島之阿老斯帶地方、當列爲第三、（式二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（阿拉哈巴）　莫理遜夫婦安抵此間後、卽宣稱、已退出與賽、其引擎一具已受重損、汽缸之顚亦燒穿、但夫婦仍謂如能覔得新件將機修竣、仍擬繼續前進、彼等昨夜自迦拉基出發來此之前、仍滿抱獲勝希望、但因迷途在巨布爾坡降落、其地距迦拉基東八百三十哩、距阿拉哈巴西南二百哩、惟後卒於上午五時二十五分抵此、距由邁爾登郝飛行塲飛出時間四十六小時五十八分、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　英航空軍官吉爾曼今日午前三時五十五分由羅馬出發、飛至奇伐西沃厚、墜地着火、致被焚死、此爲英澳間航空競賽中之第一大不幸事、（廿二日路透電）</p>

<p>荷機陶格拉斯號位居第二、但已後於彗星號許多小時、而駕機者派門蒂曷與摩爾仍望能佔前茅、該機於午後五時四十分由阿拉哈巴飛抵喀爾喀特、十時十五分抵仰光、昨日深夜已向新加坡進發、當在喀爾喀特出發前曾告路透訪員、謂彼等擬在沿途每一重要飛行塲降落、雖費時較久、然仍有佔前茅之希望、彼等現信史考特興白拉克乃竭全力飛行、此蓋言其引擎勞動過度也、派氏謂由報達至阿拉哈巴至爲平順、飛行之高度距地約一萬二千呎、渠不欲使引擎過勞、但過新加坡後、則擬以全力猛進云、德婦賴斯奇附乘該機、極讚派摩二氏之航空術、又謂彼等因有一乘客在阿拉哈巴降落、曾費去四分鐘之時間云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>金銀</h3>
<p>倫敦金價、倫敦金買、今日爲一百四十一先令六便士、漲三便士半、</p>
<p>倫敦大條　倫敦銀市穩定、但因中國售出、價乃較星期六爲低、現貨價爲二十三便士八一二五、跌一二五、期貨爲二十三便士九三七五、跌○六二五、印度買進、投機家有購進者、亦有售出者、</p>
<h3>滙兑</h3>
<p>英美　用金國星期六日在比京開會後、所發表之宣言、已使金幣在今晨外匯市塲中較前赴色、而美元亦隨之昂起、英美匯兑開盤、價爲四元九角五分六二五、跌二分一二五、午前逐步低落、跌至四元九角四分六二五、至午後二時、乃回漲至四元九角五分一二五、較開盤低半分、又美金一元、合英金四先令○四七三、</p>
<p>英法　開盤價爲七四佛郎六二、比星期六日低三十八磅音、在再跌九磅音至七四佛郎五三後、價乃回起、漲至七四佛郎七一、較開盤高九磅音、</p>

<p>美棉　羅總統最近演詞、有先辦理國家放欵而後處理退伍兵士　給金等語、棉市人氣爲之一振、雖棉市開盤時、稍有觀望狐疑氣象、但市價漲起、因一般人對於商業之感想、已較前爲佳也、午前市况、稍覺上趨、</p>

<h3>蘇省導淮入海工程施工程序之商討　蘭咸俊</h3>
<p>我國淮河之爲患、由來久矣、蘇皖豫三省、時有淮水浸及田廬之憂尤以其尾閭之蘇北、受災最烈、民二十之大水、沿裏　河十餘縣、盡成澤國、損失之巨、不下數萬萬元、蓋因淮水侵及裏運河之所致也、故導淮會更因之積極籌備導淮實施焉、其規定導淮之計劃、本以江海分疏爲原則、而入海路綫、仍取道於廢黄河、以期安全而减阻力、但第一期工程費須一千六百萬元、深感舉辦不易、蘇省爲亟求實現計、乃勉力籌欵、與導淮會合作、並依照修浚六塘河辦法、征工實施、足見吾蘇官民合作之精神、並長吏爲民興利除害之嘉謀、　旦淮河入海、水道完成、蘇北之水患、當可减少、民生之瘠苦、或能轉變、未始非吾民之幸福也、惟此項工程浩大、自淮陰之楊莊起至套子中止、全長約一百七八十公里、出土約六七千萬公方、省府擬分兩年辦理、每年須籌欵三百萬元、工伕十餘萬人、在二年間、淮河入海工程、全數完竣、其擘劃周詳、法意良善、至足多也、惟昨閲報載導淮入海工程擬由楊莊起、逐漸東浚、至七套達套子口一段切灘工程、則歸第二期舉辦、我入聞之、不勝驚異、乃不揣　陋、敢將導淮工程何者宜先何者宜後而一陳之、希當局垂察焉、</p>
<p>自淮黄合併後、黄沙之沉澱、時有水患之發生乃黄河改道以來、河身日就淤塞、惟現在河身、東段較西略低、據導淮會歷年之測量、亦復如此、由七套至淤黄口、路程較遠、修浚困難、不若由七套至套子口切灘工程、用費旣較循故道入海爲省、且水流亦必暢利、導淮會擬由此段切灘者、蓋有由也、按淮河入海工程、有一百七八十公里之遠、依地勢論、當先切灘疏通入海水道、較爲合宜、蓋省府預定計劃在施工一年間、須完成八九十公里之河堤、苟由下段施工、於一年間、北沙至套子口一段河身、必能暢通而無阻、果爾、則淮淮漣阜沿黄之雨水、當無停蓄之虞、即有民二十之大水亦不致汜濫爲災、至波及裏運之險、更可减少、且楊莊以下沿黄千萬生靈、亦可無滅頂之慮也、若不然、由上段疏浚、全部工程未完成之先、勢必不能引淮運之水而下注現今、擬疏浚之河身、必成爲斷巷絶港、旣不可引水、又不能洩水、誠廢物也、必待至入海工程全部完竣以後、效用始得實現萬一伏秋大汛、　雨爲災、今未完成之河身、四水會歸、上水旣不能堵絶其不破閘决堤而就下、下亦不能堵絶其潰决而不致汜濫、則沿海數縣之水患、不獨不减於往昔而且過之、當局苟思及此、必不致顚倒程序而由楊莊疏浚也、若果由上段修浚、則水利之攻效未覩、而實窖已至、民二十大水之慘禍、不難重現於沿黄數縣人民之目前、故吾熟衡輕重利害得失、此番導淮入海工程、當以從下段施工較爲妥適也、</p>
<p>蘇北荒地之面積、計有八千一百平方公里、約合一千三百萬畝、但蘇省目前之經濟實力、不能盡數進行墾闢、故省府决定分期進行、將角斜以北至新洋港以南、劃爲第一期工程範圍、新洋港以北至陳家港以南、劃歸第　期工程範圍、但第一期墾闢者僅合六百三十五萬畝、其他大好土質之荒地、留待渺無確期之將來、誠爲可惜、然新洋港以北至陳家港以南之荒地、在淮河流域者、占三分之二以上、此次蘇省努力恊助導淮、固熱心於國家建設、抑於自身有偌大之關係焉、上年導淮會估計、導淮工程完竣以後、蘇省每年可增産米一千七百萬担、麥四千六百萬担、此雖合蘇省淮河支流及其流域以内計算、而其入海流域範圍、實居大多數焉、夫此廣　之地、本可大利民生、徒以水利工程未舉、坐視此數百萬畝可耕之地、淪爲荒區、致沿海人民過剩、度日無方、或則逃荒江南、或竟流爲盜匪、影響社會、不爲不巨、故亟應補救者也、今蘇省勉力恊導淮會、並仿修浚六塘河陳例、徵工實施、期將荒地早日變爲熟土、已極顯然、苟省府爲兼籌並顧起見、將預定導淮入海工程之成意變更、不妨田下段實施、旣可與蘇省人士謂蘇北荒地墾闢之進行、宜先由第二期範圍着手相符、又可免將荒地留待第　期墾闢之紆緩、然雖不能與第一期荒地墾闢、相提並論、亦可彌補缺憾不尠、豈不於國計民生兩有裨益乎、</p>
<p>現蘇省導淮入海之舉、雖曰恊助導淮會、實則僅依導淮會歷年測量之計劃、而徵工籌欵諸端、均由蘇省府負責、故其施工程序之訂定、亦自有權衡處理、逈非俯仰由人者可比也、凡天下事利害不能兩全、有利亦必有害、苟能避害而就利、斯爲得矣、况導淮由下段修濬、旣無以鄰爲壑之害、又有開墾荒地之利、則一舉而兩利興焉、故吾敢不憚詞費、籲請當局權宜從事、變更導淮施工之程序者也、第一得之愚、不知高明以爲何如、</p>

<p>現代的時代、在種種方面、都已遇到了社會價値的一大轉換期、在這一個因近代文明之必然的歸結而引起的建設新文化的過程中、數千年來均被忽略了的在人類進化上佔着極重要地位的婦女之需待解放、也就成了當前負有重大使命的課題之一了、關於這點、只須冷靜地觀察時代思潮近代文明路綫的人、是决不會忽略過這個事實的、本來所謂婦女運動、是肩荷着兩重意義、在消極方面、則是一般自覺下的婦女、爲謀解脱去男子依賴和隸屬的問題、在積極方面、則除了婦女們自身的解放之外、更是與全民族的進展有着關聯的根幹問題、換句話講、就是婦女運動之任務、必須除了爲謀獲得婦女自身的解放與地位之提高及德性之培養外、更應該從事社會生産、並提倡其能力於民族國家、所以這一個問題不僅是一個婦女本身的問題、而是國家民族之進化發展過程中之一環、歷史紀錄之指示、我們知道在十九世紀這一個時代、實在是數千年來在慘酷的束縛中呻吟着的婦女們舊生活之破壞、和婦女們的有生命的新生活之創造並駕齊驅的時代、當時因各國全在這種破壞和建設的過程中、所以全世界的婦女運動、都有長足的進步、因此雖是受了種種客觀環境之决定、接受這種新思潮機會較遲的我國、對於婦女運動、也已有了數十年的歷史、但其所築成的成果、我們雖不完全盲目地予以否定的看法、但至少在此刻的我們、也僅能做到批判地接受其結果這一點、尤其是最近這幾年來的工作、一般地説、僅喊出了一句婦女參政的口號、和做了些消極的救濟工作、而忽略了其主要的一面、其無補於婦女之前途與社會之福利、乃是無庸諱言的周知的事實、可是在另一方面、這種錯誤的路綫、目前社會上正有一般人在企圖其死灰復燃、這更顯現出今日婦女的本身、又臨到了一個更其危險的階段、此種危險在一種巧妙的遮眼法掩護之下、把婦女前途的命運從舊的束縛之中、轉而寄托於新的束縛之下、這該是婦女運動本身的發展階叚、重又遇到了一個極其嚴重的危機、在此、我們應該起來突破這個歷史的重演、但我們不願唱離實際太遠的高調、所以在此我們並無怎樣了不得的偉大和永遠的計劃之揭　、我們僅想在這一次的運動中、切實地去做些脚踏實地的事、換句話説、就是我們僅想提供我們全部智能、以謀提高並獲得婦女們在社會上一般的地位水凖、和平等機會、間接地即所以爲國家民族社會服務效力、不用説、在一切生物的進化發達上、性的分化與性的對立、固是佔有極重要的地位、然而這其間、决没有含着支配隸屬與决定優劣的意義、這已是現代由各方面已得到了的結論、所以我們不必須使得我們全體婦女在各方面全能獲得完全的自由、和完全的獨立、然而要達到這一任務份完全實現、則婦女對於男子之經濟的隸屬關係、心須予以解除、一般的社會所加於婦女們身上的鎖枷、必須予以切斷、這一點、一向就應該列在婦女運動的日程之最前列的、因爲一直到今日、一般婦女還没有能解除一切自己的特殊的生活條件、這些條件、還集中在她們的特殊的地位之中、因此、在我們今後的運動中所搬演的節目、即以如何使一般的婦女均能解除其對男子之經濟的隸屬關係、即特殊的生活條件、及如何切斷社會所加於婦女們身上的重枷、即非人的生活條件爲其中心換言之、即供給一般婦女們以解除此種對於男子之經濟的隸屬關係、與社會所賜予的重枷之必要的利器、即智能、以期養成完全自山獨立的人、以爲充作社會的戰士的凖備、而成遂其新賢妻良母之社會服務、此外、我們更深深地認識、在封建制度下的社會裏、婦女運動是不會成功的、同時在資本主義制度下的社會裏、婦女運動也一樣地不會允許有成功的一日、因此我們得到這樣一個認識、就是只有在三民主義的社會制度之下、婦女運動才能發展到更高的階叚、而完成其全部的任務、我們抱着這種並不怎樣　的熱烈的願望、秉着犧牲與服務的精神、從事於適從大處着眼、小處着手的工作之實踐、並以很懇摰的態度、希望於社會上一般的婦女們都來參加、努力、活動、同時我們更站在整個民族的觀點上而盼切於一般有集團意識的先生們給我們以襄助、啟導、批評、謹此宣言、</p>

<h3>資耀華談遊歐觀感</h3>
<p>世界大戰無可否認</p>
<p>徵信事業外人好評</p>
<p>上海商業儲蓄銀行經理資耀華君、去秋由該行遣派出洋、考察各國銀行事業、中國興信社同人、因資君爲該社幹事之一、且爲該社所設中國徵信所之常務董事、因託其順便調查各國徵信所狀况、以資借鏡、資君業於前月回國、該社同人、特於前日假座銀行俱樂部歡迎、並請資君報告其考察經過、申時社記者特誌詳情如左、</p>
<p>各國均有三多　據資氏談、此行所得、棖觸至多、觀乎華僑之日益衰落、外交官之顢頇、有色人種之被輕視、在在均足令人痛哭、若干政府大員及名流、常假出洋考察之名、實則無所事事、徒糜國帑、今年支加哥萬國博覽會中、各館均輝煌矞麗、極意舖陳、惟中國館則簡陋不堪、有類市塵中之一小攤、而其旁即日本館及滿洲館、兩兩相形、誠置身無地、大戰後各國之工商業、均飛躍猛進、一切措施、均以合理化爲標準、身入其境、徒興望洋之嘆、雖然、各先進工商國中其社會之機構、亦自有其矛盾者在、方今民主國、均有三多、所謂三多者、即乞丐多娟妓多、飛機大砲多、二次大戰之必然性、已無人敢加以否認、但一旦戰事暴發、經濟制度之樂化、將有難言者矣、</p>

<h3>歐洲的諷刺作家</h3>
<p>— 微明</p>
<p>偉大的諷刺家大都「滿肚子不合時宜」。倘使再加一點被迫害的遭遇，或者流離顚沛的經騐，那他的諷刺就格外辛辣入骨，卽使時代不同了，仍然耐人尋味的。</p>
<p>施惠夫忒（Ｄｅａｎ　Ｓｗｉｌｔ）的「格利佛遊記」到現在還是小孩子和「大孩子」的愛讀物，恐怕不單是因爲文字的美妙，想像的輕靈，也不單是因爲諷刺了當時的英國，而實在更因爲這是「人類心靈漫長的旅程」，同哥德的「浮士德」，西萬提司的「吉訶德先生」一樣。而施惠夫忒那樣「像一頭被毒的老鼠發怒地死在洞裏」（用他自己的話）的生活，是他能够辛辣地畫出了「人類心靈漫長的旅程」之先行條件。</p>
<p>西萬提司倘使不曾被海盜擄去當了五年的奴隷，倘使他在三十七歲上娶的夫人是有錢的，倘使他婚後不是天天爲債務所逼，以至坐牢，（他的「吉訶德先生」的一部分恐怕是在監牢裏寫的），那麽，「吉訶德先生」之能否遠勝於他早年寫的劇本，也許是一個疑問罷？現在我們都知道「吉訶德先生」，却不大講起他早年即些劇本了。</p>
<p>寫了「神曲」的但丁，雖則也做過亡命客，但他的全生活比起施惠夫忒和西萬提司來，舒服得多了；舒服也就是平淡。舒服又使得但丁除了把他的政敵放在地獄裏，更無其他闊達的世界觀人生觀。並且他的宗教觀又何其仄狹呀！</p>
<p>我喜歡「浮士德」甚於「神曲」，但以爲「浮士德」和「神曲」加起來，還不及「格利佛遊記」或「吉訶德先生」！</p>
<p>生活舒服，而且特别是跟當時社會相處得很和諧的諷刺家，我以爲都不足觀。這樣的諷刺家順着他那時代的「市民」的脾胃，對於「叛逆思想者」所加的諷刺，在當時大槪很博得了采聲的，可是我們現在讀他的作品，只覺得惡劣，只覺和是他是小丑，他的諷刺反成爲他自己的醜臉譜了。</p>
<p>這樣的諷刺家，其中一個就是古希臘的亞列司多芬（Ａｒｉｓｔｏｐｈａｎｅｓ）一位喜劇家。</p>
<p>他是守舊的，他寫了「雲」和「蛙」兩篇喜劇嘲諷蘇格拉底和幼里披底。他出力嘲諷這一位哲學家和悲劇家，因爲他們毫不容情地揭露了雅典社會的腐敗和愚盲。他們攻擊傳統思想。</p>
<p>亞列司多芬不能有闊達的世界觀；他憂慮着雅典與斯巴達的「内戰」，然而他在喜劇「萊息司脱拉太」（Ｌｖｓｉｓｔｒａｔａ）裏提出的「弭戰方法」在我們現在看來，眞如小丑的打諢罷了。</p>
<p>他這賓貝方法是什麽呢？是雅典和斯巴達的女子組織了「性交同盟罷工」，使好戰的男子屈服。他教她們道：先用色相誘惑那些男子，等他們急得不可耐的當兒，提出條件來丨和平休戰。他這方法在「戲臺」上是做定了有效的。</p>
<p>記得前些時候報上説歐美有些和平主義的女士們主張組織一個團體站到交戰的兩軍陣綫中間去，如果世界大戰一旦爆發的話。哈哈，想不到亞列司多芬猶有同志丨然而，這樣的「打諢」是要把世人的眼光從眞正有效的消弭帝國主義戰爭的方法上引開！</p>
<h3>淺薄</h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>平常不大談女人的人，偶然聽説他在鬧戀愛，就惹起熟識的人一時的譁噪，這是一種好奇心，本不足爲怪。譬如，最近幾月來，我也偶然的動動筆管了，就居然遠勞某教授在北平某宴會中榮幸的被提及着。據另一位朋友寫信告訴我，説某教授看了我給某某等刊物上寫的東西，十分表示不滿，理由是，「像他那樣好讀書的人不該寫那樣淺薄的東西，爲什麽不好好的寫點正　的東西呢？」</p>
<p>我接到轉來的教授之言　，自然覺得很是榮幸，同是又是汗透外套。記起十年以前，當教授還同我這淺薄的東西一樣淺薄的在北平公寓中煮牛肉吃時，誰能想到，時間不過十年而我們兩人相隔的距離，會有如此的天淵呢丨教授現在是文化界的權威了，雖然我從未曾拜讀過他的「高深」的大作，而我呢，現在流落海上，靠寫一點淺薄的東西，養活孤零零的一個小生命。自然，我是够愧死了。</p>
<p>「淺薄」，這兩個字用到批評我寫的東西上，我不表示反感，同時也無一點自愧之心。因爲我寫東西的初衷就是没有預備「高深」的，我雖然吃飽飯後也受翻翻書本，卻不曾到過外國，從過名師，肚内就没有東西，自然吐不出高論。這我不慚愧。其次，收我的文章的刊物，原本不是什麽大學的年刊，卻是供給所謂淺薄的人讀的東西，編輯先生慺次叮嚀又叮嚀的是要寫得通俗，否則會影響他們的銷路，大家會都無飯吃。所以，我每次屬稿時，在文字的形式與内容兩方面，總故意求它淺顯明白，不尙高雅，我壓根兒就没想到，這類的刊物，我那樣的文章，會有教授這類的高人去看的。所以，淺薄二字，在我並不侮辱。如果太高雅了，反有敲碎自己同别人的飯碗的憂慮。</p>
<p>再其次，就是關于淺薄二字的解釋了。教授對我的批評不知所指的是那些文章的那一方面。我寫的「科學小品」，一些關于讀書的短小的文章，我不承認它的内容是如何幼稚可笑，或者是淺薄，它並不違反科學的眞理，也從未有過常識的錯誤。我緊守着科學者應有的態度。至于表現的方式，我祗感覺太不通俗太不淺薄，太洋八股氣味了。至于説，你有學問，你就應説話説得人家都不懂，卽令這話是眞理，在我未當大學教授以前，我無理由要接受它。</p>
<p>最後，還得聲明一句，湜自從離開北平以後，並不「那樣好讀書」了。這因爲忙於衣食故，不能不使我一天天懶了。但同時也一天天看不起書本子，我想，如果也有一天坐在什麽學府上，專門賣弄書本子，終年看不見着西裝以外的俗人，那到不如一面在街頭混混，一面在樹蔭下偷看幾張破報，到流通圖書館借一二册書來唸唸，説幾句淺薄的話，那不比没有人懂，個人坐在講台上獨白更有趣麽？</p>

<h3>話别（下）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>突然神廳裏發出了急速的呻吟，像絲廠汽笛將要完結的時候那種緊接的嗚嗚聲，這使姑母不得不離開好底寳貝，走回神廳去。</p>
<p>「高佬堯，你覺得怎麽了？」聲音開頭是很高的，後來漸漸地沙啞下來，」就這樣算了吧！受罪的東西。」她已經走到床邊了，燈光停留在完全變了土黄色的姑丈底臉上。</p>
<p>「唉，你把自己那條命活埋在忍耐裏頭！屈服就是你解决事體的頂好法，你比一個小兎還來得軟弱哩。」她不住地把腦袋搖擺着。「你説我駡你，完全不受异你，我又不是一頭猪或者一條鼻涕蟲，怎能够不做聲任你受人家哄騙，欺侮？可是，事實上你已經吃盡虧，上盡人家的大當了，你那裏接受過我底勸告各鼓勵呢？自己光着身子，跪在權勢，横暴面前！高佬堯，到今天爲止，我覺得你一輩子没有做過一件對勁的事情，光是被人佔了你那自己耕得好好的二十畝桑地那件事，就足够使我恨你入骨的了。你想想，一個未滿十五歲的女孩子，嫁一個三十歲的，比自己矮一半的丈夫，那是一椿美滿的事情麽？這也不提了，我只好埋怨我底父母，埋怨我底八字，女兒家誰會有這樣好福氣，任由自己選擇牠底丈夫的呢！丨丨」她把一隻大腿蹺起放在床上，像要凖備一個較長的時間跟那又聾又啞的姑丈清算一筆舊賬。</p>
<p>「從前，我們兩個辛辛苦苦地種出來的桑，養出來的蠶，還有我日夜不停地做出來的絲，你輕輕，給絲商繭客一嚇，你就趕快脱貨了；比方我們拿自己的心血去才能够換兩毛錢的，他們不費一點勁兒就可以換四毛錢了。你説小本吃小，大本吃大，不這樣就連一個錢也賣不到——唉，給人家一追你就躱呀，避呀，難道不能反過來咬一口的麽？</p>
<p>「高佬堯，你能够告訴我麽？你在耀南面前，爲什麽顯得這樣害怕和怯弱呢？明白是他設鬼計陷害你，使你吃一塲寃枉官司，暗中貼你四十塊，那二十畝地就在他手裏過了三十年了。我曉得，你並不是貪那四十塊的，但你爲什麽不拿道理出來打死你底仇人呢？難道你完全相信世界上已經没有天理存在的了？</p>
<p>「三十年來，世界完全變樣了。現在，小孩也曉得，洋鬼子自己會製絲了，而且多到用不完，誰都不要我們的了。現在討回一塊廢地，誰高興高呢？七十歲的人還在田上打滾，那是你自己活該的啊，你旣然甘心吃了幾十所的虧，爲什麽偏偏不肯對我認這一回錯呢？……」她用手托着腮帮，像强迫囚犯招代似地盯住那要死的病人。</p>
<p>「高佬堯，我曉得你一生頂怕兩件事，惡駡和威脅可以要你底命的。阿堯，你趁還有一口氣的時候，承認你底錯誤吧，我還來得及饒恕你的，讓我們將來在地下碰見的時候好過些吧。點一點你底頭呀，……你這傻子，聽見我底話没有？」他們兩個彼此望着，沈默了，剩下來的還是痛苦的呻吟和隔壁蠶蟲底私語。</p>
<p>後來，她掉轉臉向我説，「他現在什麽都不懂的。實在，他死了我倒不覺得什麽，只是他要求了我幾次我也没有好好地燒一餐猪肉粥和糖茶給他吃，他死了眼睛也會閉不上的丨……」</p>
<p>她沉默了一會便站起來，翻開姑丈底被褥，一邊吩咐我説；「你到紅木箱那兒把壽衣拿出吧，他留一絲氣就是等待那些東西的。我替他换好了衣服，好等那付生銹的機器走得舒服一點。」</p>
<p>姑母小心地，替姑丈穿好了衣服，輕輕抱起了他，使他脚板向外放得平正之後，哄小孩似地用親切的安慰的語調説：</p>
<p>「紹堯，你好好地走你底路吧，一切也用不着掛念的，至於我，唉，不用説我一定照樣過日子的，我也要駡人的，一直到我喉嚨不中用了的時候，……老鬼！」</p>
<p>我伏在姑母膝上嗚嗚地哭泣的當兒、彷彿聽見鷄打飽嗝似的一聲細小的聲音，我於是舒暢地放聲哭起來了。好久，姑母才用事務的口吻，輕輕地，柔和地對我説：</p>
<p>「好了，快要天亮了，現在你跑回去告訴仁哥和四叔，我就呌仵作去吧。</p>
<p>我走出門外，冷風繞着我底𩓐子，才突然感到有幾顆水點從髮脚滴落頸項裏。</p>
<h3>小西崽（四）</h3>
<p>— Langston　Hughes作　佛朗譯</p>
<p>事情今晚眞是十分忙了。一些人要同時擦亮他們的皮鞋，他們坐在應接室的椅子的靠手上，辛弟拿他的黑鞋盒讓他們放上一隻脚同時擦着。一個高大的農人給他半角子小賬輕輕的在他的頭上拍一下。</p>
<p>「眞是聰明的小孩呀，」他　着茶房頭説。</p>
<p>大約十點鐘光景，棕色小姐瑪利亞麥開房間的鈴響了，但差利有着别事，祖威利斯呌辛弟上去看她要些什麽，麥開小姐剛一會從雪外跑進來和一個大塊頭怪難看的男人。他們兩個是吃了酒，辛弟在她的房門外輕輕地敲。</p>
<p>「進來，」這人咆哮着。</p>
<p>辛弟開了門，瞧見麥開小姐裸體站在地板當中梳着她的頭髮，他停止在門限上。</p>
<p>「喂，進來呀，」這人説。「她不會咬你的！那個茶房在什麽地方？我們要一些燒酒！……下去説，呌差利上這裏來！他知道我需要什麽！」</p>
<p>辛弟戰慄地走開，他找到差利時，他告訴他關於麥開小姐的事。這孩子是很驚駭，因爲他常常聽着有色人種的孩子迷眩地去看白種女人丨丨但這小茶房却僅是笑。</p>
<p>「你眞是一個啞的小鬼！」他説。「不過你在這兒祗蹬了一會，將來你會見到更多過那些的！」他䀹䀹眼，用手肘輕輕觸着辛弟。「孩子，我今晚已經賣完了十瓶燒酒！」他高興地輕聲説。「有些也是我自己的！」</p>
<p>辛弟回到應接室去擦皮鞋。一個大個子紅脖子的客人抽着烟和一班行商飲酒在一個房角落裏招呼他。「喂，孩子！來這裏給我擦鞋！」於是他拿他的鞋盒子從旁邊走到這羣人的中間，彎下膝頭在這大個子的人前，拿出他的鞋油罐和擦布，去從事工作。</p>
<p>這白種人講着尶𡯓的故事，比辛弟在黑人理髮店裏所聽過的更爲難聽，而且没有多大趣味丨有一些簡直使他不痛快。</p>
<p>他擦着鞋的那個大個子説：「現在我要説及一個。」他用一種南方的慢調子和一種柔弱的像一些老黑種人語尾的糢糊聲調説。「這是説及一個黑炭頭去看亨尼姑母……」</p>
<p>一陣粗暴的笑聲歡迎他開始叙述。他被鼓舞的説及其他。</p>
<p>「老黑鬼按着一個姑娘在堤岸上……」他開始説着。</p>
<p>辛弟擦好他的鞋子，把布放在木盒裏，站起來等他的賞錢，但這説話的人不留意這黑種小孩。直至他講完了他的故事，和其他的人都熱烈地發笑了，然後他瞧着辛弟，突然的獰笑起來。</p>

<h3>江蘇初等教育之設施（一）周佛海</h3>
<p>江蘇教育廳長周佛海、二十二日、在省府紀念週報告如下、</p>
<p>今天將本省初等教育過去的設施、和未來的計劃、簡單報告一下、</p>
<p>現在先從數字方面説明蘇省三年來初等教育量的發展、因爲整個的經濟衰落、以及財政困難、教育經費、不能有多大的增加、因之教育事業、在量的方面、没有長足的發展、不過以二十一年度的統計、和十九年度的統計比較觀察、初等教育也有多少的增加、學級數方面、十九年度省校學級數爲一百五十八級、二十一年度爲二百零八級、增加了五十級、十九年度縣校學級數爲一萬一千五百九十六級、二十一年度爲一萬四千七百六十三級、增加了三千一百六十七級、十九年度私立學校學級數爲一千一百零二級、二十一年度爲一千四百二十四級、增加了三百二十二級、若將以上省縣私立三項學級總計、則十九年度學級總數爲一萬二千八百五十六級、二十一年度總數爲一萬六千三百九十五級、總加了三千五百三十九級、學生數方面、十九年度省校學生數爲六千五百三十七人、二十一年度爲八千九百零九人、增加了二千三百七十二人、以百分法計算、較增百分之三十六强、十九年度縣校學生數爲六十三萬六千七百十一人、二十一年度爲六十七萬二千五百六十三人、增加了三萬五千八百五十二人、以百分法計算、較增百分之五强、十九年度私校學生數爲四萬八千七百十七人、二十一年度爲六萬二千九百三十二人、增加了一萬四千二百十五人、以百分法計算、較增百分之二十九强、若將以上省縣私三項學生數總計、則十九年度爲六十九萬一千九百六十五人、二十一年度爲七十四萬四千四百零四人、總增加了五萬二千四百三十九人、這兩個年度比較總增加的人數、用百分法計算、實爲百分之七强、經費方面、十九年度省立小校經費爲二十八萬九千二百二十三元、二十一年度爲三十三萬七千九百九十七元、增加了四萬八千七百七十四元、以百分法計算、較增百分之十六强、十九年度縣立小校經費爲五百三十六萬九千三百七十九元、二十一年度爲五百五十一萬一千七百四十三元、增加了十四萬二千三百六十四元、以百分法計算、較增百分之二强、十九年度私立小校經費爲五十二萬四千二百五十一元、二十一年度爲七十一萬零五百三十九元、增加了十八萬六千二百八十八元、以百分法計算、較增百分之三十五强、若將以上省縣私三項學校經費總計、則十九年度小學經費總數爲六百十八萬二千八百五十三元、二十一年度爲六百五十六萬零二百七十九元、總增加了三十七萬七千四百二十六元、這兩個年度比較總增加的銀數、用百分法計算、實爲百分之六强、統觀以上各增加率、學生之增加、以省立爲最大、私立次之、經費之增加、以私立爲最大、省立次之、由此可見江蘇小學教育從數字方面比較觀察　雖在繼續不斷的進展中、但是進展的速度、非常緩慢、如果照這樣下去、義務教育的普及、不知要等到何年何月、然而人民負担、不能再加、地方教費、開源無着、無米之炊、也要難爲巧婦了、</p>
<p>現在再把過去已做的和未來預備做的、較大事業、分開省辦事業和縣辦事業、層次的來報吉一下、</p>
<p>（一）過去的設施</p>
<p>（甲）省辦的</p>
<p>（一）創設義務教育實騐區　義務教育的普及、雖然重要、但是如何始能普及、普及的方法、各方面提擬的很多、簡易小學、短期小學、二部制等、但是究竟那一種方法最爲簡單易行、容易收效、這是很難斷定、而須加以實騐的、因爲如此、我們就在二十二年度、創設了五個省辦、義務教育實騐區、他們的任務、在將所有普及義務教育的方法、整個包含在内、加以實騐、以觀察其結果、五個義務教區的地點、是鎭江·淮陰·東海·黄渡·棲霞山·都委托省立師範或鄕村師範學校校長去辦、所以揀這五個地點的原因、第一、鎭江是江蘇省會、而小學校設立的很少、學齡兒童失學的很多、不能不先謀救濟、並且也可樹成全省的模範、淮陰東海、地處江北、比較教育不發達、應該以省的力量、補助他們小學教育的發展、黄渡和棲霞山、則因爲該兩處鄕村師範學校的成績都很優良、兩位校長也極肯努力做事所以特别呌他們担任這個重大任務、以冀有新的貢獻、給大家參考、至於各義教區内、學校的教師、大半是利用最高年級的師範生、一方可以節省公家的費用、一方可以增加師範生實習的經騐、現在統計五個義教區設立的各種性質的小學、共有四十九所、八十三級、（未完）</p>

<h3>錢行素等在南昌女運會表演記</h3>
<p>成績優美在贛備受歡迎</p>
<p>南昌首屆女運美滿結束</p>

<p>兩次表演四座爲驚　大會第一日第二節目後、上海小姐即參加五十公尺表演、出塲者爲錢行素·陳淑卿·陳畹卿·王郁鶯·許沅·等五人、發令後、五女士振臂而起、往前直奔、未二十公尺、陳淑卿女士已佔先着、錢女士反落於後、觀衆心理、必料錢女士這番必失敗無疑、詎知錢胸部一挺、即爲離弦之箭、飛奔向前、抵終點時、則已先陳一胸膛而轉敗爲勝矣、觀务咸爲鼓掌稱快、其成績爲六秒八、是日比　成績之最高者、爲七秒六、相差不啻霄壞、八十公尺低攔預賽完畢時、錢又偕王化昌女士表演跳攔錢之跳攔技衛、非常嫻熟、姿勢亦極佳、每越一欄、歘然而起、飄然而落、令人目不睱接、無何二人已越過最後之欄、將達終點、時錢尙落王後、觀衆又不禁爲之揑着一把冷汗、乃錢加足速率、結果仍贏王女士一綫、其成績爲十四秒六、</p>

<p>籃球表演技術驚人　大會第三日（十六）、東亞隊表演籃球、爲最精彩之一幕、觀衆雲集、將整個球塲包圍、東亞球員於萬衆歡呼中、登塲獻技、上半時與東亞畢業之男生相角逐、精彩百出、觀者嘆服、結果成十與十之比、下半時與女運錦標隊（女職）比賽、成一面倒之局勢、女職球員、相形見拙、結果東亞二十九分、女職祇得三分、</p>
<p>一般印象極爲深刻　此次錢行素等十餘人蒞贛表演、各方得有下列深刻之印象、（一）服裝及生活、甚爲儉樸、所費僅五六百元、不及前次楊秀瓊所費之四分之一、（二）錢等爲人忠厚、學識亦多可取、極無都市摩登化之積極、（三）錢女士書法甚秀、國語演説亦情楚而有條理·令人動聽、此實最使一般要人表示敬意</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解　零窺門憐少女　願聞困苦惜玉訪　家</p>
<p>他一手拿了細草帽子，在當胸慢慢的扇着，一手提了一大串肥羊肉，口裏哼着陜西帮子腔踱着緩步子走了過去。當他走過去的時候，僅僅是把眼光向這些工人，斜看了一下，立刻全塲嘈雜的聲音，都完全停止了。程志前對那人望望，又對工人們望望，等那胖子走得遠遠的，實在有些忍耐不住了，這就向工人笑道：剛才過去的是什麽人，我看你們，倒很有些害怕的樣子。一個工人笑答道：那是我們掌櫃的，我們怎樣不害怕呢？先生，你吃過了嗎？程志前道：你們吃得很苦呵！那工人歎了口氣道：這不算苦，到了我們鄕下去，那纔是苦呢？你們作先生的人，那裏會知道？程志前笑道：有的也知道，有的也不知道，不過我心裏想着，若是比這再苦，那就只有光吃雜糧了。那匠人聽他説這話，好像是嫌他過於外行，向他身邊的同伴微笑了一笑。程志前看來是自己失言了，這倒有些不好意思。於是搭訕着笑道：我聽到説，你們這裏還挖了幾個窰洞子，在什麽地方？一個工人向後面指着道：那裏不是嗎？程志前順着他手指的方向望了去。在院子後方，有道二尺高的磚墻，好像是個花台子，又像是個水池子的欄墻，立刻走向前去看時，在短墻的轉角之處，開了個缺口子，有一層層的階級，可以走了下去。果然的，在平地挖下去一個很長的深坑，成了一個夾道。夾道的南邊，將土作了照墻。夾道的北邊，就砌着壩，挖着門窗，一排五六間，儼然是房子。（四六）</p>
<h3>生活之今昔觀</h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>生在目前這個時代，誰不是嚷着「生活艱難！」的確，生活的艱難，如今已到了極點，而成爲雖掩的事實：以視前清「乾隆」「嘉慶」年間，簡直是霄壤懸殊，不可同日而語！那時人民的生活，拿現在的眼光看來，實在好算是天上神仙，幾生修到！謂余不信，有書爲證。</p>
<p>昨天偶向日中曝書，檢到一册林琴南先生著的「鐵　亭瑣記」，把它翻閲一過，有着如下的一段紀載：</p>
<p>『前清「乾」「嘉」間，閩中至儉樸，城人亦如村居；賃肩輿者，行十里，爲錢四十。流娼居矮屋中，春風一度，得錢三十六文。吾友丁唐好諧謔，嘗語余曰：「昔有浪子，能以百錢享酒肉及飯，且嫖，且賭，且賃輿，爲錢不過百也！」余曰：『請問其目？』丁曰：『自南門達江南橋，賃輿四十。橋上有肆，買粳米和肉，錢十三。酒一巨杯，六文。春風一度，僅三十六。尙餘五文，三文與小賭博，所得彩爲鵝卵；餘二文，天暮，購火炬入城，爲數不適百乎？而諸惡皆備矣』！余爲之大笑』！——按此書現有單行本，唯本條則被删除。</p>
<p>看了這修瑣記，能弗令人企羨古人生活之易，而嗟我生不逢其時？像這浪子一天的花費，若拿現社會的生活程度相衡起來，還不够它的百分中之一二。然則，把那時的人當作『天上神仙，幾生修到』，不能算是信口開河，過甚其詞吧？</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （水鍔）</p>
<p>都市是一隻金絲做成的籠，裏面囚着一大羣自鳴得意的鳥。</p>
<p>經騐是人們的一册好書，而好的書本，却祇是人們一册參考書。</p>
<p>錢，用到了它的最後幾個，你才會覺得它的寳貴了。</p>
<h3>鴛鴦譜</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>最近報上有一幅有趣的廣告，圖爲青年男女各十人，手中各持一線，這二十條綫，併合後，總繫在雲端裏月下老人的手中。每一條綫上，都寫了這二十個青年男女的姓，一對對繫結着，暗藏在月下老人的手中，這便是將來命中前定的夫婦，名呌「鴛鴦譜」。這幅廣告，是給讀者猜的，猜中的可得鴛鴦枕等香艷贈品。</p>
<p>這個生面别開的游戲，委實非常有趣；可惜咱們不是月下老人，恐怕做了喬太守，未免要亂點鴛鴦譜，不但得不到鴛鴦枕，生怕被月下老人打一棒呢</p>
<p>難道夫妻的結合，果眞權在月下老人嗎？目下時代，兩性的結合，不但年老昏憤的月下老人，没有主權。便是親生的父母，那裏有主權呢！也許月下老人，早已辭職，和他的老太婆，退隱山林去了。這個繫紅綫的責任，已交卸到「財神菩薩」手中咧。</p>
<p>考月下老人的典故，是出於「續幽怪錄」中的。據説：「唐韋固旅次宋城南店，有老人向月檢書。固問何書。曰：天下之婚牘耳。入米市，有眇嫗抱三歲女來。老人指曰：此君之妻也。固怒，磨小刀付奴殺此女，奴於衆中刺之而走。又十四年，相州刺史王泰妻以女，容色華麗，眉間常貼一花鈿。固問之。曰：昔在襁褓，乳母陳氏，抱行市中，爲狂賊所刺，瘢痕猶在也。固曰：陳氏眇乎？曰：然。因述前事，想敬愈極。宋城宰聞之，因題其店曰「定婚店。」這當然是一個神話，在從前「嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗」的時代，確是一個安慰的妙法。到如今，假使有月下老人的話，他老人家也不耐煩牽這紊亂糾纒的紅綫了。</p>

<h3>水烟筒</h3>
<p>— 夏涔鵑</p>
<p>水烟筒一名水烟袋，又呌水烟管，名雖水烟筒，但並非專是用來吸蘭州水烟的，甚麽皮絲，凈絲，和鄉下老大伯所吸的老朝烟，都可吸的，水烟筒的構造有三種變遷，第一種俗名苗子烟筒，形式簡單，長度足有一尺多，吸烟的拿在手裏非但不美觀，而且很不便當。這種烟筒，遠在六七十年前有的。現在可説得絶無僅有。第二種改良得小七玲瓏，第三種改良得越發好了，名字呌做噴筒。什麽呌做噴筒呢，因爲普通烟筒所吸剩的烟蒂頭，必須要拿出那個烟管頭來吹去的，噴筒却不必這樣煩，只須稍稍把烟管頭一提高，那烟蒂頭一吹而出。水烟筒在捲烟没有出山時，他的地位也佔了家用必需之品，無論貧富，家家都有這麽一隻二隻備着，如有佳賓蒞至，除開香茗外，再須把水烟筒敬奉過去，卽是客人是不吸水烟的，也接受了裝裝樣。所以在昔時茶樓中有裝水烟的一種職業，就是上海的勾欄曲院中，據説伊們也拿了水烟筒裝給相好吸的</p>
<p>自從捲烟盛行，水烟筒就被打倒，成了强弩之末，水烟筒的命運也險些告了終。虧得還有一般老年人仍舊用着水烟筒來吸烟，保持他原有的地位，所以業水烟筒的商店，天天在那裏嘆氣，倘是不兼售别種東西，差不多要緊緊褲帶喝西北風了。這也是商業中滄桑之一。</p>
<p>今年政府提倡新生活運動、儉的字也佔了重要部份。所以我便戒除捲烟，改吸水烟，一個月的成績，大足驚人，因爲本來要每月化去五元左右的捲烟費，現在的水烟費每月一元也不到，而且捲烟含有尼古丁的毒質，在水烟筒吸烟，根本没有毒質，又經濟，又衛生，何樂不爲？心有所感，連帶的記起水烟筒來，記此以告吸捲烟的人們。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>初離山海關，我們所見到的多半還是平原。過了新民之後，人烟是格外的稀了，而許多或高或低的山嶺，却逐漸在我們的前後左右出現了；這些山嶺大槪都是某一條小山脈的分支，有的離路軌很近，有的相距得很遠，但没有一座具備着怎樣雄偉的奇觀。惟有在西面的遠處，却隱約可以見到一條綿互得很長的山脈，峯高挿雲，層疊相接；而這時候我們的列車，恰好正朝着它那個方向前進，因此愈行愈近，先是只見淡墨一般的一綫的，漸漸地變爲灰色，再變而爲藍色丨一種藍得非常可愛的顔色。但在事實上，它和我們相距兀是很遠咧。</p>
<p>當我正在聚精薈神地欣賞那些遠處的山色時，忽然覺得我們這一列御用列車上，似乎已起了一種騷擾的狀態；雖然並没有人在跳躍奔逐，也没有人在高聲喧閙，但秩序畢竟已不像先前那樣的整齊了。我不免很詫異，忙找一個同伴一問，才知我們的列車，將並不直駛奉天；在奉天的前一站丨皇姑屯，就要停下來了，其餘的一段路程，我們將不再依賴那牛步式的火車，而將更換我們所習用的官轎了。</p>
<p>我旣然已經知道下車在卽，也就無心再眺望野景了；而這時所經過的一段短程中，實在也没有什麽特殊的景物，値得欣賞。（一五六）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>濟南蒲菜</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>在夏秋兩季，從五月端午節後、到九月重陽，山東濟南全埠，最新鮮而風行的菜肴，便喚作蒲菜。凡是到過濟南的人，經過這夏秋兩季的光陰，怕没一個不想到蒲菜的風味，是何等的鮮潔。</p>
<p>蒲菜的形狀，同南方的茭茸菜差相方弗，可是潔白絶嫩，在任何蔬菜之中，怕为上種是可以比較得上，就是杭州最有名的邊筍，比了蒲菜，還得遜上一籌，滋味的佳妙，便可想而知了。蒲菜的煮法，有紅燒，有白炒，可以炒肉絲，可以拌干絲，在濟南最著名的一種，却是奶湯蒲菜，用肉同魚的鮮汁，煮成了似奶汁般的白湯，把蒲菜放在湯内煮熟，即成了這一味濟南的名肴，眞是别有風味，見了白乳般的鮮湯，和絶嫩的蒲菜。誰都可以想到這菜的鮮美，忍不住食指大動了。</p>
<p>究竟這蒲菜是一味仁麽東西呢？却是生在濟南大明湖中的蒲草，在夏秋之交，正是鮮嫩的時期，採取那白嫩的一段，就成了這種美味的菜肴。在上海和各地，西菜館内，常用一種舶來品的罐頭蘆笱，便是這種蒲菜。在夏秋兩季，蒲菜鮮嫩的時候，收買了去，煮成了裝好罐頭，仍運銷到我國市場上來，可是它的價格，却已增加了十幾倍的數目了。我國人民，只知道這種罐頭的蘆筍，是菜肴中的美味，不知道它的來源，就是蒲菜，只在這一出口一進口之間，金錢的漏巵，正不知已有了多少的鉅大了。</p>
<p>濟南大明湖中，出口最豐富的，祗有那蒲菜，除了本地在當令時煮菜之外，收買的人，不知有多少，都是收去做成這種罐裝蘆筍，所以濟南大明湖蒲菜的出産，每年總在一百萬元的光景，銷路便以做蘆筍原料爲大宗，倘是把蘆筍每年進口和銷塲的數量，同了出産蒲菜的數量，互相比較，又得每年損失了若干萬的金錢。</p>
<p>蒲菜到了冬春之間，老的時候，可以刈割下來，做成蒲包，市上各處所用的裝物蒲包，便是老的蒲菜所做，可算得是蒲菜的一種副産品。</p>
<p>我國人民，大都只知道守舊，不想生新，似這種天然出産的蒲菜，旣有這般的利用，可以製成蘆筍，何不自己設廠裝製，使大好利源，被人家一舉手之勞，盡爲所有，倘能利用這種天然産物，自設裝製蘆筍的廠家，行銷全國，也未始不是杜絶漏巵的一端啊。</p>

<h3>標粉因補空步漲</h3>
<p>丨收前爲套賣壓平丨</p>
<p>昨粉市開盤即漲、蓋承前日收市漲風之餘威、市上各方一律看好、買氣之旺、一如前日、且福新廠空出本月籌碼尚多、均欲趁小收補、而浮空心思更虚、求補尤亟、新多之浮户與業外大户均極活動、蓋　子内外人心一致向上、午後開市以金價飛騰、漲風尤旺、比之前日收價計漲四分半至三分不等、後福新停出、阜豐套賣、市即壓平、但收市價仍比上週末爲大、計本月大二分七五、下月大二分半、十二月大三分、一月大二分二五、二月大一分七五、</p>
<h3>新多抬高遠期麥</h3>
<p>昨麥市開盤後、本月份爲多頭了結、價小三四分、但拍到遠月　即有業内外新多頭爭先購買、因粉市步升、洋麥雖小、金價劃高、而金價之飛升更甚、因此引起新多頭與補空之吸收、且現小麥廠胃已活、價亦步高、故下午近月亦即上升五六分、遠期被補空收買外、又有新多頭競買、漲度更甚、其後雖有多頭了結、市價一度平落、而而果終見上漲、收市價本月反大三分、十一二月二月各大八分、一月大一角一分、現麥廠去一萬四千包、價開高麥三元七角、中次照别、比上週末漲一角、</p>
<h3>客糙本銷大活動</h3>
<p>丨期洋米産價高昂丨</p>
<p>昨洋客秈市况、均見活潑、客秈自價高後、到頭漸旺、但去化更旺、市乃步步上升、昨内地本街爭辦客糙、開出漢口沙市各糙四千包、價又漲五六分至近角、客秈機砶到存到少、市亦步好六七分、洋米現貨浮存不多、市頗挺站、惟河下各尖米新貨上市、去胃並不活潑、故市呈堅擯局面而已、惟期貨産價步昂、蓋自白銀問題發生以後、合價漸高、新交易漸次沉寂、昨開回籠十月份四元九角、只有一百噸成交、因囤户亦看好不出、</p>
<h3>河下米市南疲北俏</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源稍夥、共到三十餘號、貨共四千五六百石、窰種銷塲、本街有限、客帮包胃續有、青島帮採取八百餘包、惟以到貨較多、人心略餒、形勢初雖似緊、而結果帶軟數分、餘若白稻野稻及厚新粳等以本街去路轉淡、市形清寂、價跌一角左右、杜洋尖亦以供過於求、呈垂疲之色、僅各色破礱無榮辱、新陰飯担胃納轉懈、市態亦現軟象、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船念一二艘、河存仍稀、約七八十號、市上各貨去胃、新粳破粳新杜尖陳白元零消續化、新羊尖貨稀消滯、窰種胃活、新陳埠、客尖陰元問津亦俏、市價破粳新粳陳白元稍帶軟勢、窰種昻二三角、新杜尖加數分、新陳陳埠客羊尖挺立、除元加起一角、</p>
<h3>黑芝蔴跌勢猛速</h3>
<p>新黄荳逐步下游</p>
<p>九江新黑芝蔴上市以來祗有旬餘、市價自第一批至昨市、無日不在挫跌中、原因貨厚銷細、貨户不得不甩賤引胃、昨市比上週六又跌四五角、中關貨祗開六元、較第一盤價已跌去二元九角、白芝蔴依然穩立、惟高貨稍軟、因凑做洋莊貨不合算之故、昨統市成交各蔴有千餘包、行情續砌角許、新黄荳惟高貨尚平、中次行情逐見下游、因去路有而不勁、來源則尚湧、故市氣不振、浦東新杜豆及崇明新沙黄、到頭寥寥祇二三十包、所以市面尙平穩、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>白片糖價漲五角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、照標金關金見升而論、固應轉升但銷路並不因此而增、故趨勢依然平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通現貨十八元九角、無上落、本棧貨十八元九角半、小去五分、轉口貨五元八角小去一角、荷赤尙乏上落、去化不多、本廠綿白復小一角、較高一號十七元六角二號十七元三角、三號十七元、四號十六元七、太古糖小二角、Ｂ嘜爲十九元八角、ＣＷ嘜十九元半、ＤＹ嘜</p>
<p>十九元三角、ＨＸ嘜十九元一角、號貨無甚成交、惟聞白片糖有某號抛售七百包、價比前漲起五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　桃棗圓肉市氣緊張</h3>
<p>核桃前市手揀桃、曾到二十四元、近步降二三元、始轉緊勢、昨下午五時許、據天津電訊、各檔桃忽漲二元、今日行盤勢必隨升、「紅棗據電訊、亦有外帮採辦、趨勢回緊、後市當有升無降、一同安桂圓肉、一自跌價以來、市勢漸定、昨據客電要求、加價二三元、後到之貨、自心扳緊不售、待機轉升、同時行盤亦必隨升、蓋各檔圓肉貨中、當以此貨爲最平直、</p>
<p>油市</p>
<h3>新貨將登之白桐油</h3>
<p>漠市洋莊白桐油自前日售關一百噸、價格每担爲二十八元四角洋規、近兩三日來、僅數十噸交易、市面尙無變動、據洋行雖不續辦、而來源亦稀、所以形勢尚可穩站、惟臺新已迫在眉睫、陳油市面、已成强弩之末、原不能作爲標準、且各處均注重於新油之抛價、漢市前幾日所抛、祗二十五元光景、後尚無續交、恐尚有再跌希望、浙桐油亦漸趨疲弱、溫州油在申售開十一月份交貨、每砠爲二十五元五角、杭州方面雖不聞有做開、大槪有交與溫州油亦屬相彷、本埠洋莊近亦有少數期貨交易、聞在十一月解油、每担價格在二十六元四五角、傳爲東洋所辦、不識確否、</p>
<h3>柏油已跌至底盤</h3>
<p>丨預料産新後銷塲可旺丨</p>
<p>柏油産新漸近、而各處陳油存積尙厚、銷塲零落異常、連日據漢口函詳、來源絡繹不絶、而去路僅屬零星、故重荆已至十四元進關、平荆祇十三元三四角、麻城油十三元光景、本埠行家雖存貨無多、然銷路幾與落令相等、市塲上暮氣沉沉人心懈惠、客貨亦稍有到、一時亦難開盤、重荆每砠十六元客規、行家亦不貪取、售盤無木重荆十六元二三角、有木十六元、平荆十五元三四角、麻城油十五元稍零、然價格跌至此步、當無再跌可能、惟皂廠毫無用塲、專靠製燭去路、總是有限、所以照現在存貨觀察、新貨未出以前、陳油萬羅售罄、將來新油未必見俏、但因各處燭淘底積極薄、待到産新、必須採辦、故新貨見後、銷塲或可見旺、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>薄白鐵新貨裝到</h3>
<p>薄白鐵前因貨缺、各帮採辦甚衆、故市象十分良好、標凖飛黄騰達、如三尺七尺每張估一元四角五六分、三尺六尺估一元二角五分、四十八張美貨估一元五角、但購者踴躍、致市貨斷檔、向後購者頗有向隅之嘆、最近新貨裝到有二萬餘張、係英日諸貨、故買客方面、聞此消息、已多下手採辦、聞昨已抛出二三千張之多、而本街之建築帮談判者仍多人在、故市價方面、依然未見回衰、</p>
<h3>烟皮鐵現貨斷檔</h3>
<p>烟皮鐵新近若津烟青諸帮、進辦良好、故到貨被購殆盡、標準每札開至十一元四五角、市上現貨已有斷檔、故多抛進期貨、昨爲星期、然亦有數百札批成、行情如本月底由到貨開十一元、出月上旬到貨開十元零六角、下半月到貨則估十元零二角半、所進大都爲本月到貨、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>法國絲銷曇花一現</h3>
<p>昨據法商信孚洋行傳出消息、里昂生絲市塲、現銷依然沈靜、惟華絲價因法匯暴縮、暗漲甚劇最近兩日中白廠經廠圖牌等級市價扯合每包已漲至五百六十餘元（華幣）、三跳舞牌等級五百二十餘元、較諸週初激漲四五十元、昨法郵船島斯號出口本埠信孚達昌等祗有黄白絲經二百七十四件、裝在馬賽等埠、法銷曇花一現、</p>

<h3>手腕的運動</h3>
<p>— 聚生</p>
<p>手腕的運用，在現在是一個人必知而且精的道理。爲了吃飯，那不消多説，人人要運用着他的靈活的手腕，好在「飯鬥爭」的世界中獲得永久的勝利。不會運用手腕的人，是時代的落伍者，是『痴』！</p>
<p>其實並不止於爲了吃飯才運用手腕的。因爲手腕的靈活，有了飽飯吃了之後，仍然忘不掉牠，以期於食之外，獲得了其他的東西。不過，在吃飯上，看出更眞，更清楚的情况罷了。</p>
<p>一個月拿三十塊錢的小書記，整日戰戰競競的，留神科長的眼色，把公事辦得漂漂亮亮的博得一聲好或是一幅帶着贊許的笑容：一方面又要運用手腕，使與科長不合適主任看出自己是効忠於主任的···手腕靈活的，便能雙方討好，自己保持之飯碗。你若憑了良心去幹事，那只有坐在家中！</p>
<p>至於局長之流，也未嘗坦然無事。要使上司看出自己是一個効忠的人物，又要使下者有擁護的熱心，而自己又想從中獲些實利，於是，手腕的運用更要靈活了。一個名無其實，同聲博贊的人物，一定具有人所不及的手腕的丨所謂天才或也是這一流人物。</p>
<p>爲了自己，自然要運用手腕的。要想陷害，排擠，攻擊對方一個人，亦必須運用你的手腕才行！要在無形中使你感着「啞子吃黄連」的苦處，你自己也平安無事，得其所哉！所謂「殺人不見血」，殺人不用刀」，就是這個。也就是運用手腕。</p>
<p>揑造事實，散放流言……都是運用手腕的方法。不過，日新月異，一切都進步着，眼見手腕的運用又有無數新方式了！</p>
<p>假使你太信用了他人，或者你太老實了，那决不是你的優點，反是你的弱點；不能玩一點手腕，未免太「少不更事」了！那你就是『痴』！是呆子！</p>
<p>手腕的運用是一切塲合所必須的，無論你對誰，無論對方是什麽會談漂亮名詞的偉人，戴方帽子的留學生，新時代的前驅……都是中國人的時候，都會利用手腕來對付你；你不會的時候，不正是落伍嗎？</p>
<p>學吧丨向社會中學習吧！手腕的運用是吾們必要的呀！</p>
<p>然而，然而，···啊！不必轉過來説了吧。</p>
<h3>月夜</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>月，圓圓地亮晶晶照在頭上。</p>
<p>水波成漣漪，岸邊蘆荻給風吹得俯仰有緻。遠處的樹林，濃郁郁地一片漆黑，然而它的輪廓却給月色刻劃得織微畢現；山峯爬伏在地上像獅子，似乎時時在仰起頭來噓氣。靜寂，靜得連犬吠聲都不能聽見。這晶瑩純潔的月夜，似乎在充分地告訴我們説：「秋，眞偉大啊！」</p>
<p>我們划了一隻小船，在湖邊蕩漾，除了漿影水聲外，我們都靜默着。眞的，非這樣也不能領略到靜中的滋味。</p>
<p>我們棄舟登岸，走上不甚險峻的山峯，這時聳觀全鎭，都在眼底，但看不見一些燈光，聽不到細微入聲。我們大樂，有的劃然長嘯，呼出胸中的鬱悶。有的曼聲低吟，似乎是表示刹那的歡欣。我遍觀儕輩，無不面有得色，大槪平日煩慮，當此明月，被山光水色，已經一洗無餘了。</p>
<p>韶光不再，在此賞心悦目的良辰美景，大家忘形鼓舞，原不可以厚非的。然而好景不長，當我們發現了逸萍在俯首沉患時，我們便又索然了。</p>
<p>原因是逸萍吟丁兩句詩：「同來玩月人何在，風景依稀似去年」—。原來較之去年中秋，同來的遊山伴侣；　　少去三四人了。</p>
<p>轉瞬光陰，這又成了三年前的陳跡。</p>
<p>現在我旅居滬濱，當此明月，雖然尙有舊日一二同伴可以晤談，然風景已非，尙有何樂趣可言。更想到夜凉似水的月光底下，故鄕的舊同伴，蕩漾於湖泊山頭時，檢點同伴已如晨星的寥落，再誦逸萍吟過的舊詩，恐怕不但興趣索然，兼要悲愴欲絶了。</p>
<p>聚敢本無定時，兼之生活之鞭時在驅策我們，我們又何用其悲感，愴傷。</p>
<p>讓他埋入心之深處吧，我的朋友，永遠不要再記憶。</p>
<p>我們實在急急需要走上新的路途了。</p>
<h3>爲某君失戀後造像</h3>
<h3>秋收</h3>
<p>— 奕</p>
<p>李太爺新屋的那扇紅色的小門開了，王老頭子這時哭喪着臉的走出來，看他那一副頽喪的臉孔，就知道他向李太爺的請求又是絶望了。自從入秋以來，王老頭子已有十多次這機的失神似的走出這扇紅色的小門了，他的臉龐，也一次更甚一次的悲愁着。</p>
<p>「王老伯：怎麽樣呢？又没有了嗎？」</p>
<p>站在對面倭屋門前的李三子的媽，很關心似的問着。</p>
<p>「大嫂，别説了吧，這個年頭，眞是，呌我怎麽樣活下去呢？」</p>
<p>王老頭子很頽喪的回答了幾句，也就望着對面走過去。他這時心裏在想：「李大嫂的家裏怕有東西可以吃吧！」但當他走近了李大嫂的身邊，他就發覺她的臉上，是比幾天前不同了，幾天前的晚上，他到李太爺家裏借不到米之後，他就跑到她這裏來吃飯的，那時她和着她的兒了，還好似很高興的談笑着來安慰他，可是今天變了，李大嫂的臉上，好似剛哭過了的留着一條條的淚痕，眼睛失神的有點兒腫。他想着：「她們也和我一樣了嗎？」</p>
<p>「李大嫂；三子哥呢？現在還到城裏做生意嗎？」</p>
<p>李大嫂聽到了她兒子的名字，眼睛就吊下淚來了，這可把王老頭子馬上的給呆住了，他一時摸不着頭腦的，也不知説什麽來慰問她了。</p>
<p>「王老伯：我眞痛心哩！還不是在三天以前，到城裏去做生意，就給抓去了嗎？眞是天殺的鬼，我前世不曉得和他們結下了什麽寃，好好的一個兒子，王老伯你曉得，他從來就是一個安份守己的孩子，他們還説他是什麽搶米的要犯，應該禁了起來，王老伯你想，我只有的這個兒子，這後半生就望着他來養我，但是現在那些天殺的鬼，却把他抓去了，這我可怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>李大嫂一面説一面哭着，説完了更是嗚咽得不成聲了。這在王老頭子看起來，眞是不知説什麽了，他只好安慰的説：</p>
<p>「唉！李大嫂别哭吧，哭了也没有用，我想天總不會呌好人受屈的，像三子哥那樣的好孩子，天終是會可憐他的，你還是好好的去求李太爺想一個辦法救救他吧丨我想李太爺是你們的老叔，總比我們親近些，難道他會看着三子哥白白的受屈嗎？」</p>
<p>「唉！王老伯你别説起我們那老叔吧，有錢人是不會來可憐窮苦的親戚的，我早就找過了他，可是他不但不給我想法子，還説是我縱容了兒子，弄得今日這樣的收塲，你想，教我怎樣説呢」</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>？</p>
<p>「唔，天下眞有這種毫無良心的人」！</p>
<p>「王老頭子嘆了一口氣的低下頭去，那兩天没有吃過一點東西的肚子，使他再不能忍耐下去了，他辭了李大嫂，拖着那沉重的腿，望着西村的馬二爺家裏走去了。</p>
<p>秋天的太陽是溫柔的，在這廣漠的平原上，一到了黄昏的時候，太陽的紫光照耀着大地，一幅金黄色的圖畫，就很美麗的蓋在這平原之上，雖然那田野間盡是一些枯黄的稻草，和散佈在壠上的枯頽的樹叢，但赤地千重，正更現出金黄色的美麗。王老頭子很頽喪的走出了西村，他望着那枯萎的稻草，出神着，秋收，這在他是絶望了。</p>
<h3>女人</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>我確有點歡喜清靜的脾氣，如果我所住的地方，小孩子太多，或是人家太複雜，太吵閙，這個地方要我多住了一些時候，在我確是很感到困難的；因此，搬家對於我就好像家常便飯了。</p>
<p>這次新搬的家，地方確是很不錯，同時也十分清靜，清靜得有如禪寺，屋裏一個小孩也没有，三層樓還空着囉。我搬進來已住了兩天了，房東和房東太太的樣子生得怎麽樣？一點也不會知道。據住在三層樓的後樓那個年輕的女人丨那就是我起初來看房子的時候的引導者丨説：房東是開糖菓廠　，房東的太太白天裏要跟着房東到廠裏去，一直到夜半才歸來。但是，住了不久，我對於這個年青的女人的身世又發生了懐疑了。</p>
<p>這女人是和她的丈夫同住在三層樓的一間狹窄的後樓。瞧她的年紀最多是不會超過了二十的，人樣生得還不錯：有着瓜子般的臉兒，和苗條婀娜的身材。家裏却很簡單，除了她丈夫之外，還有一個上了年紀的「媽媽。」—據説這「媽媽」是她的親娘。然而爲什麽她很安心地每晚讓她睡在扶梯底下和白天裏像娘姨般的爲她們操作呢？我起初眞有點看不慣下去，心裏也隱隱地憤憤不平。</p>
<p>她的丈夫也是同她一樣的年輕的小夥子，可是一點男子氣槪都没有，成天的躱在閨房裏，連大門口都不敢踏出來。</p>
<p>每當夕陽西下的時候，吃過晚飯之後，照例地這位年青的太太就裝扮得花枝招展，點上胭脂，楚楚動人地丢開她的丈夫，跟着她的媽媽出門去了，一直到時鐘敲過兩下之後，才姗姗地回來。「到底上什麽地方去逛呢，難道夜夜如是的逛着不會厭倦嗎？」當我聽見她的遲緩乏力好像極度疲倦的脚步在扶梯上走動的時候，我不禁這樣地想着。</p>
<p>但這年輕的太太的秘密，終於在一天無意中給我發現了。</p>
<p>那天在大世界，我發現了這年青的太太跟着一個中年的男子在説笑談情，態度是多麽地親暱，風騷，溫柔···的呵！呵，這年青的太太，她的秘密今夜已給我完全發現了，於是，我再不敢從她的面前經過，我迅速地離開這個黑暗的地方。</p>
<p>「呵，這年青的太太呀丨他的青春和靈魂，都給這都市的惡魔蹂躪凈盡了。」當我回歸的時候，我不禁這樣地興嘆着丨</p>
<h3>東西南北</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>我們的國粹是『各人自掃門前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜。』這種古董話雖不能應用到現代，但人家販賣日貨，横横良心，竟是一炸彈，倒底太不像『四海之内，皆兄弟也』了。</p>
<p>年少氣盛，自然是免不了的，爲了一點小事，打得眼鼻頭腫，身體髮膚，受之父母不必説，貼橡皮膏終究虧本不上算。</p>
<p>爭氣不爭財，尙有理説，化掉幾個錢終是小事，而爭來的面子可以終身直起大拇指説得響嘴。</p>
<p>抵制日貨，已喊得筋疲力盡了，國民性貪便宜那有什麽辦法丨要愛國就製造便宜的國貨來，不抵制自會抵制的，像跪哭團那樣的滋淚縱横，簡直貽笑大方丨</p>
<p>愛國要愛在心裏，説不買日貨就没有買過日貨，能够做到這樣，不抵制也會抵制的，何勞大駕抛炸彈？</p>
<p>哀莫大於心死，愛國儘管愛國，奸商還是奸商，前浪推後浪，悦來繼悦來，劉崇武前車可鑒也，</p>
<p>更正　昨日『東西南北』文中上海興業銀行係『中國』興業銀行之誤，特此更正。</p>
<h3>賣文與署名</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>賣文章，在表面上看起來，似乎是一件美事，其實，也有着許多的痛苦的，尤以靠作文章吃飯的人爲最利害。但是，這事實是常被忽略了的，原因在客觀的想像並不是眞實，而眞實的情况是只有本身才能領會的。</p>
<p>賣文章，在客觀者或許要認爲「扶案千言」是「可立而待」的，自然，跟着就是那花擦花擦地大洋，也是「應手而來」的，這，也許會有，但恐怕也不會多見。</p>
<p>在此，有的人看到了「花擦」的可愛，而忘記了「扶案」的可憐，於是，作文章的多了。其結果「可憐」不但没有避免，相反的却在增加，而「應手而來」的希冀倒很少如願以償的。</p>
<p>爲了競爭，發現了「署名」的需要。本來，署名不算一回事的，或者也可以、説那並没有很重大的意義存在，至多，只不過在掩蔽着本名的眞實，爲行文的便利而已。</p>
<p>至現在，這似乎已成了一種風尚，一個人的署名在一個以上以至於五六個的，很爲平常，不足奇怪。也就因爲不足奇怪，一個不算一回事的署名，也竟蒙上了一種厄運，牠，不單給張三請了去帮忙，同時，還要給李四應酬塲面，持不定，旁邊的趙五也要把牠請了去抬説一下的，於是，身兼數職，異常顯耀。</p>
<p>自然，顯耀是一件光榮的事，旣然「承蒙不棄」那是「時運」的「高照」，這是値得欣幸的，旣不必到商標局註牠一個册，又不必太小氣歸有私有；因爲字屬公衆，應任隨便。</p>

<h3>世界最大海底隧道落成記</h3>
<p>— 嚴明</p>
<p>銜接英國利物浦及勃金海兩大城市之間的皇后隧道，不但是全世最大的海底隧道，亦爲最近全世界最偉大的工程之一。不久以前，這世界最大的海底隧道，由英皇及英后親自由倫敦到利物浦，舉行落成大典，呈利物浦空前未有的盛况。隧道建築的經過，計有奠基禮起，一直到最近完工爲止，一共費去約有八年以上長久的時間，建築費達一千萬金鎊之巨，建築期中，曾由政府設立隧道工作委員會，專司其事。隊道工作委員會，曾將英國全國各地所有著名的工程設計家，建築家，搜羅殆遍，在全國可謂已没有一個爲建築海底隧道而空閒的工程設計家或建築家，足見這次工程的浩大，實開世界上建築工程的新紀元丨隧道深入海底中的海底，卽使世界上吃水最深的輪船，也儘可以在上面若無其事地通行無阻。隧道長度爲五英哩，闊約四十四尺，可容四輛汽車同時相互平行。在這一偉大工程剛開始動工的時候，在費去建築家，工程設計家的不少心血的困苦之下，依然有很多的工人，犧牲在裏面。其致死的原因，大多因爲隧道中空氣窒塞，無法呼吸的緣故。因爲在旣長且深的隧道内，空氣要像地面上一樣的流暢，自然是非常困難而且是不可能的事。但後來經過建築家們長時間加以縝密研究以後，結果在隧道兩端，各築成通氣塔三座，用以調節隧道内外的空氣，此項工程做得非常完美，所以經過隧道的人，現在都已覺得和地面上没有什麽兩樣，毫無一些窒息的感覺了。</p>
<p>現在再將當時舉行海底隧道落成典禮時情形，寫一些在下面：</p>
<p>落成典禮是在本年七月十八日在利物浦舉行。那天早晨，英皇偕同英后從倫敦乘火車到利物浦主持典禮，利物浦居民逢此空前所未有的盛典，眞是歡喜得發狂似的，英皇及后車過之處，莫不歡聲雷動，屋頂及窗口均有人以國旗揮舞，表示歡迎的熱誠。隧道口的王街，更是人山人海，擠得水洩不通，以待英皇及后的蒞臨。隧道兩旁各建築物上，蹲滿了身穿五彩衣衫的活潑的男女小學生，頗爲英皇及后所注目。英皇及后御車到利物浦後，卽換乘汽車至華爾登公園，此園亦與海底隧道同時落成，即由英皇順便舉行落成禮，禮畢，卽驅車至王街，羣衆見英皇偕后御車至，齊聲歡呼，時已近正午，典禮乃開始舉行。先由英皇檢閲軍隊，皇后檢閲藍開夏軍中救護隊，檢閲畢，卽由利物浦市長及隧道工作委員會主席威脱爵士，相繼致歡迎詞，繼由英皇演説，申謝全國建設家及工人的一致努力，得完成此全世界獨有的神奇工程，同時並對那些爲工作而死亡的工人，表示敬意。英皇演説畢，卽在十五萬民衆之前，將案上的機鈕一按，隧道口之幕，卽自動分開，英皇乃偕后乘車首先向隧道進發，以利物浦警察音樂隊引導，汽車從斜坡駛至隧道口，卽見由電光綴成的「歡迎陛下」幾個大字，英皇車後，無數的貴族及平民的車輛，魚貫而行，一小時内，計已通過二千五百輛。</p>
<p>所引以爲遺憾的，便是隧道除開幕典禮日外，利物浦市政府貼有佈告，平時不准行人通過，但駕駛汽車者除外。這一點，也是世界最大海底隧道落成後的「美中不足」。</p>
<h3>建築師之在中國</h3>
<p>— 雅潔</p>
<p>建築師，是使建築物巍然高矗，屹然偉岸，唯一從旁贊襄促在的人物；時代化的大厦巨府，是莫不經過建築師的預先設計，築時督工，事後佈置，隨時忠告手續的；這是每個稍有常識的國人所默認的，可是最近有一種普遍現象，對建築工程師一界，有非常的認識，就是反建築師，列入上等，奢侈，消毫社會生産，人物的一類裏，這種新觀念固然是由於國人對建築業詳細情形專門學術未能澈底了解，明白透視，所發生出來的歧念，同時該項專門人才，對於自身業務有玩忽，或甚至爲人鄙棄，也不能辭咎卸責，這當然是無可諱言的；</p>
<p>本來建築事業的興衰，大小，重要與否，和影響到建築師增减的數目，是在同一路綫，成正比例的，換言之，一國需要大量建築物，努力建設事業，猛進力謀民生問題，則專門人員之裁培造就，和徵求需要，是必然性的，否則適得其反的結果。</p>
<p>照建築師服務，對社會盡力方面着想推論，是决不能和一般所認爲奢華用品，譬如：價値連城的珍寳，昻貴華麗的汽車，和其他種種用大宗金錢購得之貨品，所可同日而語，或更爲進一步的相並論，要或使之列入日常生活需要物，譬如：食，衣，住，行，四大人生要素中，似尙不嫌有不倫不類，良以建築營告學，及建築師營業精神，均主服務社會，造福人羣，凡能使業主能少一分担負，必盡力圖之，旣使已至最低限度，亦必設法，謀所以能不費額外支出，特普通人民，非但不明乎此，反認爲所費，只多無少，常識之缺乏，認識之不清，可深浩嘆。</p>
<p>不過事之發生，以曁傳聞之開始，必先有因，而後有果，然則建築師被認爲奢侈資産附屬人物之誹辭，必事出有因，而决非空穴來風也，是以今後之我國建築師，當力謀善後，思有以挽回此種乖説，而創造别一風格，使國人有另一番新觀念，新傾向。</p>
<p>所以使以上乖説之倡行，迄今猶餘燼未熄者，均此項專門人才中，有疏忽業務，或怠惰服務精神，有以致之耳，倘能各自眼光擴大，不斤斤於委託事業之無利可圖，或思想不集中於受委偉大築物之觀點者，則個人鮮有不成功，地位未有隨之增高，第能注意此點者，全國能獲幾人？猶有能理深一層，使建築專門事業技術之可靠省費深入民心，輸入民間，使之澈底覺悟，所謂下層工作之能引人入勝，淆轉觀聽，試以醫業，建築業，同一專門學術，精巧技術，而相比擬，前者爲世所普遍認識，視爲必需，而後者則被歧視，認爲奢侈者之流，豈後者學術技術之稍遜於前者歟，抑或患病者衆，較造屋闢居尤爲重要歟，曰一則學理技巧，深入民間，爲世崇信，一則認識不足，印象較淺，由觀點上錯誤，遂生歧視，由必理上之邪念，遂失信仰，吾有望於我國建築工程師，應急起直追使服務本旨與利益，廣行推進，使民間雖販夫走卒，亦能知其妙處，輒信仰一生，自能使業務與大衆結不解緣，同時乖念自熄，信譽日隆，事業蒸蒸日上，地位無形增高不少也。</p>
<h3>房屋避水工程</h3>
<p>— 隆</p>
<p>吾國建築事業，晚近以來，與日俱進，工程日趨偉大，設計日趨週密，於是避水避潮，亦已認爲重要問題之一，蓋潮濕之於房屋，非特有損美觀，且爲衛生所不許，其在工廠堆棧復有機器銹爛，貨物霉腐之虞，至於建築物之有地坑水塔者，則避水工程，更形重要。</p>
<p>避水工程，似甚簡單，而實甚複雜，因地坑避水法與墻垣避水法不同，而屋面避水法又與水塔避水法各異，蓋修理地坑，須有能使水泥於數秒鐘内堅結之化學品，以抵抗每方寸數百磅之壓力，墻垣則須透明之避水物，以不損原有美觀爲條件，屋面則須堅韌耐久物品，而水塔則須不含毒質之材料，物旣各異，方法更隨之不同，非專門研究不能了解也。</p>
<p>避水種類及方法幾複雜如上述，則避水材料製造家，非有獨到之學識，豐富之經騐，十餘種精美之出品及數十素有訓練之工人，不足以致應付。</p>
<p>海上之經售建築材料者，對於避水物料，每多不全，而於用法又復不甚明瞭，致用户每感不便，雅禮製造廠，對於避水材料，及避不工程，均有專門之研究，在吾國允稱獨步，該廠又爲普遍避水工程學識起見，特著有「建築避水法」小册俾建築界有所參考，並設立工程部，以備各界咨詢，並承辦各項大小避水及修理工程，便利各界不少。</p>
<h3>日本的紙糊房屋</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>建築界之奇跡</p>
<p>我們的東鄰大和民族，在世界國際地位，雖也立於第一等强大之列，但他們的全民衆個性，却是機巧善變，似乎不很受世界的稱讚吧？他們的工業製造，凡關於口貨，則格外輕浮，卽以兒童玩具一項而言：大率根本不堅，全以滅料省工爲主，俾易於圖謀厚利，我國由來已久，竟是他的唯一分銷處。自從「九一八」「一二八」兩役之後，國人居然覺悟丨一方面高喊着經濟絶交；一方面認眞的創造國貨，從積極和消極兩方看來，一若眞具有發憤圖强之偉大精神！不過實際上究竟如何？我們看見報載「互惠通商條約」，又接連的妥協。再徵諸已往替他「專門經理」「獨一分銷」的畸零狀態，便成爲通商則有之，互惠實未必，這是極端矛盾的事，絶對無所疑義的啊！然而話又得説回來，以上討論，皆屬題外，無關宏指，不勞曉曉。祗有「機巧善費」這四個字，始有關於本文一叚小小的記述呢？</p>
<p>因爲在日本建築界，有一位建築師，名呌喬伍郎的，發明一種「紙糊房屋」。試想：以紙質糊造眞人住居的房子，是何等機巧？而房子竟能用紙糊之，又是何等善變？這不但爲世界奇聞，各國建築界傳作美談；而且在他們時常發生地震和風災之國内，有此紙房子，解决住的問題，很能避免或减少危險程度。喬伍郎創造的心理，原卽希望抵制地震和風災而起，但未來之企圖，是否如願以償？尚無相當把握，該建築師現方猛晋精研，不稍自餒。所以一般人預測，此機巧之建築物，必能有新的貢獻於世界建築界，并能給予善變性之國民以不少的利益。至於吾人對於救災卹鄰之念，并不因仇而歧視，故亦深　其成功，爲建築界開一新紀元。苟再推廣實用，則彼居於頻年風災常川地震國内之人民，賴此紙糊房子，以保全他們生命的危險，未嘗不是人類的幸福。</p>
<p>建築紙糊房屋的大宗材料，則爲百磅以上最優厚之馬紙。此紙富有黏性，在紙類中最堅固耐用，其横堅尺徑，亦很鉅闊。該屋之牆壁，屋頂，窓户，及一切重要部份，皆用馬紙糊黏而成。不過各部份有厚薄之分，其糊黏度由數層起，以至數十層止，每層紙上，均塗抹濃厚白膠，最外層則敷以魚漆，經長時間陰晒之後，并加繪各式美麗畫圖，能受風雨之侵蝕淋漓，而不剝落。又爲預防强烈日光蒸薰，恐將魚漆白膠晒化，消失其黏貼力，則屋雖不倒，天窓必然四啟了。故用一種科學方法，製成抵禦日光蒸晒之藥水，遍塗屋頂及牆壁上，以防不測。楝樑支架，門窗鬪筍，及牆壁鈎接之處，全用極細銅條和鐵鈎之屬任之，該項鋼鐵份量極輕微也，以堕落擊人不致傷害爲原則。</p>
<p>在該日本建築師整個計劃中，統計每一間紙糊房子完全成功，以槪需要馬紙二萬五千張，魚漆白膠共約二百斤左右，細鋼條小鐵鈎等約共百四十餘件。一切設備，并不十分單純，各項搆造，應有儘有，較瓦木工程之房屋，似亦無甚異處。按喬伍郎係日本眞岡縣籍，其鄕環山帶水，地震風災，頻年不絶，雖値春秋佳日，竟也難免。喬氏居常，對於住的問題不得安全，憤恨萬狀！於是苦心孤詣，十餘年研究，才有現在初步之落成。再該屋全部，可以隨時拆卸，隨地裝置，換句話説，就是能够搬移携帶，毫無妨礙。同時也可稱爲旅行房子</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses the Criminal Code</h3>
<p>Chapter Three, "Crimes Against International Relations," Reserved</p>
<p>Chapters One, Two, Four, Five, and Six All Passed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At ten o'clock in the morning on the 22nd, the Legislative Yuan convened a general meeting with over sixty committee members present, including Zhu Hezhong. Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting open and continued the review of the amended Criminal Code. Huang Youchang stated that although Chapter Twelve, "Security Measures," had passed the second reading, he requested, following the precedent of reviewing the draft constitution, to submit amendments before the commencement of the third reading. He suggested that the articles on security measures and probation could be separated into two chapters, similar to the Japanese system, for clarity. Furthermore, he noted that alcohol addiction was not as prevalent in China as in other countries, and therefore the provision in Article 88 of the amendment, which stipulated that individuals who committed crimes due to drunkenness should be placed in a suitable location for abstinence after serving their sentences, seemed unnecessary. He proposed deleting this article and including it in the chapter on criminal responsibility, as in Article 32 of the current law. Zhou Wei argued that Chinese people did not habitually drink alcohol like foreigners, and adopting Article 33 of the current law would be more appropriate. Liu Kejun, Shi Shangkuan, Zhao Chen, and others refuted Huang's opinion, stating that Japan separated security measures and probation for specific reasons, which differed from China's intentions. They also pointed out that Germany did not separate this chapter. Moreover, Article 88 did not prohibit the sale or consumption of alcohol but specifically referred to those who committed crimes due to drunkenness. This provision was not exclusively for Chinese people; foreign residents in China who committed crimes due to drunkenness could also be subject to this article. Huang Youchang clarified that anyone with basic knowledge would know that this article was not about prohibiting alcohol. Therefore, alcohol itself was not the issue. He believed that the necessity of establishing a rehabilitation facility for those who committed crimes due to drunkenness after serving their sentences was questionable and advocated for restoring the meaning of Article 32 of the current law. Lin Bin stated that Article 32 of the current law held individuals responsible for crimes committed due to drunkenness, but the wording of the proviso was unclear. For example, if a drunk person injured someone, it was due to excessive drinking. If the excessive drinking was intentional, the drunk person should be responsible. However, if someone was persuaded or forced to drink to the point of intoxication, their responsibility could be reduced. The proviso in the article, which stated that the sentence should be reduced if the drunkenness was unintentional, was inadequately worded. Article 88 of the amendment already explained the responsibility for crimes committed due to drunkenness. If it was believed that the drunk person's digestive system had changed, the circumstances could be considered, and they could be sent to a suitable location for abstinence. Since the opening of maritime trade, the law should not fail to explicitly address a situation simply because it was not common. After Lin finished speaking, Chen Changheng requested a vote on whether to adopt Huang's proposal. Huang Youchang, seeing that there were very few supporters, withdrew his original proposal voluntarily, and a vote was not necessary. The discussion then moved to Part Two, Specific Offenses. In Chapter One, Sedition, Article 98 stated: (1) Anyone who, with the intention of subverting the government of the Republic of China, seizing territory, or disrupting the national constitution through illegal means, takes concrete action shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than seven years; the ringleaders shall be sentenced to life imprisonment. (2) Anyone who prepares or conspires to commit the crimes in the preceding paragraph shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than six months and no more than five years. Jian Youwen argued that the meaning of the phrase "illegal means" in the article was unclear, seemingly emphasizing the issue of legality versus illegality while neglecting the crime of subverting the country. Wang Xiaoying stated that the phrase "through illegal means" in the article seemed to imply that the state could be overthrown using legitimate and legal behavior. Since the article already contained words like "subversion," the phrase "through illegal means" should be completely removed. Zhu Hezhong, He Sui, and others seconded this proposal. Ji Chengzhong, Chen Ruxuan, Zhang Zhihan, Shi Shangkuan, and others debated for a long time regarding issues of national constitution and form of government, but no conclusion was reached. Later, Liang Hancao proposed a new amendment, which the majority of committee members agreed to. This revised the article to: Anyone who, with the intention of undermining the national system, seizing territory, or altering the national constitution through illegal means, subverting the government, takes concrete action shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than seven years; the ringleaders shall be sentenced to life imprisonment. The second paragraph remained as passed in the second reading of the amendment. Articles 99 and 100 were passed without objection. The meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock, and the review continued in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued discussing the amended Criminal Code at 2:30 PM on the 22nd. In Chapter Two, Crimes of Treason, the phrase "government" was removed from the phrase "colluding with foreign governments" in Articles 101 and 102. Article 103 was amended as proposed by Chuan Bingchang and Huang Youchang to: Citizens of the Republic of China who serve in the enemy's army or use enemy weapons to resist the Republic of China or its allies shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The second paragraph, corresponding to the third paragraph of the amendment, stated that anyone who prepares or conspires to commit the crimes in the first paragraph shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than three years and no more than ten years. In Article 105, the phrase "transferring troops to enemy countries or" was added before "important fortresses and naval ports..." as proposed by Zhu Hezhong, and the last paragraph of that article, "no less than one year and no more than seven years," was changed to "no less than three years and no more than ten years." Article 107 was amended as proposed by Chen Changheng, adding the phrase "no less than one year" before "no more than seven years" in the first paragraph. The remaining articles were passed according to the amendment. Chapter Three, Crimes Against International Relations, was reserved because Chuan Bingchang raised concerns about the provision regarding insults with additional harm in Article 114. The general meeting approved the re-submission to the Criminal Law Committee for amendment according to Chuan's proposal and further discussion. Therefore, the entire chapter was reserved. In Chapter Four, Malfeasance, only Article 131 was amended, changing "in post offices or telegraph offices" to "in postal or telegraph agencies," as proposed by Shi Weihuan. The remaining articles were passed according to the amendment. Chapter Five, Crimes Against Public Service, and Chapter Six, Crimes Against Voting, were all passed according to the amendment. The meeting adjourned at approximately six o'clock, and the discussion would continue on the morning of the 23rd. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Reports at the Central and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Wang Qi... How to Rescue the National Economy</p>
<p>Ju Zheng... The Responsibilities and Hopes of the Judiciary</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central government held its 153rd Memorial Week at nine o'clock on the morning of the 22nd. Approximately 400 people attended, including Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, and staff. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Wang Qi reported on "How to Rescue China's National Economy Today," stating that China's economy was on the brink of difficulty, with rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial depression, a rapidly increasing trade deficit, and an inability to balance international payments. To seek rescue, he believed it was necessary to: (1) adopt guarantee methods to circulate cash in rural areas to increase rural production; (2) adopt a joint system, using joint organizations of chambers of commerce, trade unions, and commercial and industrial associations to control the economy and increase industrial and commercial production; (3) adopt "ten-person groups" to purchase and use domestic goods, organizing the consumption of domestic goods to promote the implementation of economic control. If the people of the whole country could cooperate, unite, and practically implement the above three methods, without personal or local prejudices, with consistent steps, the results would be immediate, and this economic difficulty would surely be resolved one day. The meeting adjourned at ten o'clock. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd. Over 300 people attended, including Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Cao Haosen, Li Yuanding, Chen Shuren, Lin Xiang, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and staff from various Yuan, ministries, and committees. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Ju Zheng reported on the Responsibilities and Hopes of the Judiciary, stating that since the Central Political Council had resolved to place the Ministry of Judicial Administration under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan last week, the Judicial Yuan had now acquired a judicial administration organ. He had been in office for nearly three years and felt that he had achieved little. The responsibilities he would bear in the future would be even greater. Today, he reported the following four points: (1) The state's legal system is not only used to govern people but also contains instructive significance. Only by using the law as instruction can the law achieve its supreme meaning. China is currently in a period of metabolism, and human feelings and customs naturally tend to decline and become difficult to reverse. The highest judicial organ, in addition to handling people's litigation cases, should also bear the responsibility of instructing the people to understand the law, which means not only passively reducing criminal behavior but also actively promoting the people's upward mentality. (2) Strict law alone is insufficient for instruction, and using spiritual and moral influence to remedy what the law cannot achieve is often futile. However, there are times when the law is exhausted in its ability to maintain order. Future judicial officers should urgently study the principles of social evolution in China to seek the latest way out for the law. (3) Foreigners in China have consular jurisdiction, while Chinese people do not, which is an extremely unequal situation. In the future, we should strive to recover consular jurisdiction and consider the current state of the judiciary in various countries to achieve freedom and equality. (4) Currently, the majority of counties throughout the country still follow the system of county magistrates concurrently managing judicial affairs, which is a shortcoming in the judicial system. We should first raise funds and train talent to prepare for expansion. At the same time, we should improve the organization and enrich the content of existing courts to ensure that the people have a deep belief in the courts. Improving prisons and promoting prisoner labor are also urgent needs that should be implemented with determination. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Repair of the Putai River Dam</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The stone dam on the Yellow River in Putai, which was washed away by water, has been repaired and stabilized. The River Bureau has sent personnel to repair the earthworks of the Wangwangzhuang Avenue and Wangda Dike downstream. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Flies to Hankou, Yang Yongtai Passes Luoyang and Goes to Bian</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Xueliang and Yang Yongtai, among others, traveled by car from Xi'an to Huayin on the morning of the 22nd, then changed to a special train to Luoyang. Yang and others passed Zhengzhou and went to Bian. Zhang Xueliang got off the train in Luoyang and returned to Hankou in his own Ford airplane at 2:00 PM, arriving at 5:00 PM. He Chengjun, Yu Xuezhis, Zhang Qun, and Yu Fengzhi were all at the airfield to welcome him. After Zhang arrived, he instructed the Ford plane to fly to Bian for standby.

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>New Lineup of European Gold Standard Countries - Su</h3>
<p>France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland. These are the only five major gold standard countries remaining in the world today. How can they stand firm amidst this raging tide of currency inflation and remain unchanged in the face of gold? Surely many scholars will consider this a miracle today. However, if we examine it carefully, we realize that their intention to "play the game" is actually no different in essence from countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, which are vigorously pursuing currency inflation. Although they nominally do not follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, they are actually doing exactly the same thing, using the maintenance of the "gold standard" as a weapon to compete for markets. Such methods are indeed identical.</p>
<p>The five major gold standard countries, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland, recently signed a protocol in Brussels, Belgium, based on a proposal by Belgian Foreign Minister Jaspar. Three points in the protocol are worth noting. First, reconfirming the policy of maintaining the current gold content of the currencies of the respective countries. Second, regarding the exchange of goods between the respective countries, it is hoped that the actual trade volume in the one-year period after July 1, 1933, will be used as the basis for a 10% increase. Third, matters concerning tourism and transportation will be discussed after a detailed report is prepared. From these three points, we already know that these five major gold standard countries are attempting to move towards a higher level of economic groupism based on several "like-minded" countries. What does this signify?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that since 1929, almost every country in the world, except for Soviet Russia, which is still able to increase national production based on its two five-year plans, has been in a state of extreme difficulty. Therefore, the contraction of trade volume and the reduction of capital profits have become the fundamental reasons driving those great powers to engage in more intense economic warfare. Under this situation, economic units such as the "Sterling Bloc," the "Dollar Bloc," and the "Gold Standard Bloc" have emerged. Based on this principle of "joining forces with the majority of countries," the general powers have gradually begun to raise their heads again from their declining fortunes. If the five major countries want to fight further, they certainly cannot escape this method. This is the first point expressed in the protocol of the five major gold standard countries. Second, the protocol of the five major gold standard countries also expresses a counterattack against the currency inflation movements of the United Kingdom and the United States. Under the silver movement, the exchange rates for gold standard countries have become lower and lower day by day. Furthermore, the economic blocs of the United Kingdom and the United States are using the effects of currency inflation to stimulate production upwards and to expand markets through dumping. This is an even greater threat to gold standard countries. Therefore, it is necessary to reorganize this front in order to counter the offensive of the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Finally, the recent protocol of the five major gold standard countries also indicates an even more important significance, which is that the sharpness of economic warfare has deepened even further. If the actual trade volume among the five major gold standard countries is to be expanded by 10%, it will only be possible by further expanding the application of quantitative import controls. Now, not only trade is subject to such severe restrictions, but also travel and transportation must be subject to control policies. How can such a nerve-wracking battle plan not make people nervous? The five major gold standard countries are giving such an answer to other related powers. We cannot but pay extra attention to their future.</p>

The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The declaration of the congress is as follows: Declaration of the Second All-Army Representative Congress of the Air Force Special Party Department. In order to review past work and promote future party affairs, this Special Party Department specially convened the Second All-Army Representative Congress in Nanchang on the 20th of this month, which concluded on the 22nd. A total of 78 representatives attended and more than 30 proposals were discussed. The spirit of the congress was to be fast and practical, and the venue presented unlimited vitality. Now that the task of the congress has been completed, we have determined the future struggle guidelines for our country based on the needs of the environment. The mission of our air force is to take "avenging humiliation and revenge" as the greatest goal. We recognize the perilous nature of the national environment and the importance of our own responsibilities. In the future progress of air force construction, we must lead all air force party members to work hard in many aspects. (1) We must eliminate all bad old habits and old concepts, cultivate new life and new living, so that the body of the air force will not be tempted or eroded by external objects, and become a healthy person at the forefront of the times. (2) We must base on the principle of self-reliance and self-improvement, and not rely on external forces for development. Although it cannot be completely achieved recently, we must gradually seek self-reliant construction. (3) We must complete the plan of "internal pacification before resisting foreign aggression", and do our best to assist all armies in thoroughly suppressing the Red bandits, eliminating rebellion, and seeking the true unification of the country. (4) We must absolutely obey the command of the revolutionary leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, undertake the arduous task of completing the second phase of the National Revolution in China, and restore the status of the Chinese nation. (5) We must engage in rigorous self-training. Training is the vitality for our air force to eliminate the old and bring forth the new. We must use countless trials and tribulations to bring the technology, physique, character, and spirit of our military personnel to the highest peak, and make each of them a healthy cell. (6) We must party-ize the air force. If the air force is not party-ized, the party's revolutionary spirit will have no place to be placed in the air force. We must have a living and revolutionary-spirited air force, we must party-ize it. (7) We must urgently expand and enrich the air force for the purpose of self-defense in the Second World War, and never let today's air force repeat the mistakes of the Sino-Japanese War navy. (8) We must unite sincerely and take love and mutual assistance as the only moral concept, eliminate the bad habit of non-cooperation and factionalism, and through the unity within the air force, we must jointly seek the common life and death of the army, navy, and air force, so as to obtain the greatest guarantee of victory in the decisive battle against foreign aggression. In short, based on the above-mentioned common beliefs, this conference vows to supervise and lead all air force personnel to complete it in the shortest period of time, so as to live up to the painstaking efforts of the revolutionary leader who founded the air force, and to satisfy the most sincere and enthusiastic expectations of compatriots and comrades across the country.

Each of the three has its advantages and disadvantages. Building a bridge is expensive, but the trains run easily. Digging a tunnel is a huge project, but there is no special danger.

Whether he will take office is still under consideration. In terms of serving his hometown, he cannot refuse. In terms of the complex situation in the county, he is afraid that his talent is not enough to handle it. County administration is a miniature of national politics.

<h3>Reform Plan for Japanese-Controlled Puppet Organizations - New Official System</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Bureau of Legislation has drafted a new official system for the reform plan for the organizations in Manchuria. The essential points of the draft are as follows: (1) The Affairs Bureau for Manchuria will be directly under the management of the Prime Minister, managing the affairs of the South Manchuria Affairs Bureau.

<h3>The UK and the US Unanimously Oppose Japan's Increasing Naval Ratio</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the UK intends to accept the total tonnage system</p>
<p>Preliminary UK-Japan talks begin today</p>
<p>(London) At the time of the naval talks, the UK will probably try its best to oppose Japan or other countries' motions to change the current warship ratio system and replace it with a total tonnage system, because the total tonnage system will be very unfavorable to the UK. American experts also said that after the total tonnage system is implemented, the United States will concentrate all its efforts on building large battleships, heavy cruisers, and aircraft carriers, which is opposed by both the UK and Japan. Therefore, the London Times and the Observer have recently published articles saying that the UK may accept the total tonnage system to resolve the difficulties of the ratio problem, which surprised everyone. British naval authorities said that no matter what the meaning of this argument is, it cannot show that the UK can allow Japan to increase its ratio. It is said that the UK has long planned to add high-speed cruisers. It is heard that Prime Minister MacDonald confirmed in mid-July that the UK will increase the number of cruisers by 50 to 70 after the expiration of the Washington and London treaties. However, if the United States specializes in building giant ships under the total tonnage system, the UK will not be limited by the situation and build unnecessary warships.

<h3>Contents of Japanese Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese newspaper reports, the atmosphere in London is now better than before, and there is hope of concluding a new treaty to replace the Washington Naval Treaty. Officials here believe that the progress of all matters depends on the results of the preliminary UK-Japan talks starting tomorrow. Japan will decide its own attitude after it is sure of the attitudes of the UK and the US. However, according to Japanese newspaper reports, Japan's naval policy is based on the following points: (1) Military equipment must be sufficient for defense needs and ensure national defense security, but not enough to attack people. (2) Abolish the 5:5:3 ratio. (3) Abolish offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers and reduce the tonnage of battleships. (4) Retain defensive weapons such as submarines. (5) Abolish the Washington Naval Treaty, and it is even better to have joint action by the signatory countries. (6) Conclude a new treaty based on the principles of equality and fairness, and stipulate the total tonnage. It is heard that methods are currently being discussed to publish Japan's proposal in London and Tokyo at the same time. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Opinions are Divided into Two Factions</h3>
<p>(London) The outline of Japan's demands on naval issues has been explained to the press by Rear Admiral Yamamoto. When the individual talks between the UK and Japan officially begin, Rear Admiral Yamamoto will also explain in detail. These talks are scheduled to be held at 11:30 tomorrow morning, chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald. Currently, British public opinion on the various points requested by the Japanese navy has two different opinions: one is that political figures are eager to avoid naval arms competition, and their attitude is inclined to compromise; the other is that the naval department firmly opposes any concessions. In addition, the United States also expresses hostility to the ambitions of the Japanese navy, which will make the British naval department more determined, because the people in the department, in addition to their views on technical issues, also have the political view that the Anglo-Saxon nation should maintain its solidarity in the Pacific, and will therefore become more and more eloquent. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the preliminary talks in London begin, the Imperial Government will propose a new disarmament policy to the UK and the US, and move towards concluding a new disarmament treaty. However, whether or not the new disarmament policy proposed this time will be announced, the foreign and naval authorities have already agreed on the policy, and the decision is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When inviting preliminary talks, the British government said that these talks would be conducted individually and the content would not be made public. Therefore, the Imperial Government will consult with the British government when announcing the disarmament policy. (2) When it is deemed necessary to announce the disarmament policy, it should be announced in London and Tokyo at the same time. (22nd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval negotiations between Japan and the UK are scheduled to begin tomorrow (the 23rd). The Japanese representatives plan to first present Japan's disarmament plan and explain the reasons for the abolition of the Washington Treaty. The Japanese government's disarmament plan will be released simultaneously in London and Tokyo on the 23rd. (22nd Jiji Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Declares That the Conclusion of Non-Aggression Treaty Has Not Been Considered</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, rumors have been spreading both inside and outside Japan that Japan has seen through the breakdown of the Disarmament Conference and will propose to the UK and the US the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty after the breakdown. The task of Ambassador Hirota, the former ambassador to Italy, representing the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is also in this regard. However, at this time when the preliminary disarmament talks are about to begin, fearing that this rumor will be used as a tool for containment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue an unofficial statement today, denying this claim, saying that Japan is determined to break away from the shackles of the Washington Treaty after the end of 1936, and is also determined to propose a new disarmament plan in this preliminary disarmament talk, hoping to conclude a new maritime treaty. It is rumored that it intends to propose to the UK and the US the conclusion of a political treaty after the breakdown of the conference, but the Japanese government has no such preparations.

<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations Continue on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Hirota Demands Withdrawal of New Conditions</p>
<p>Russian Representative Cables Moscow for Instructions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the illegal negotiations for the Chinese Eastern Railway, since the meeting between the Russian Ambassador Yurenev and Foreign Minister Hirota on the 15th of this month, the negotiations were again on the verge of collapse due to the new conditions proposed by the Russian side. Afterwards, as a result of consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministries of Finance and Commerce, it was decided to reject the new proposal from the Russian side. Foreign Minister Hirota then invited the Russian ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1:30 PM today to demand the withdrawal of the new conditions by the Russian side. It is reported that Hirota's attitude today was quite firm. (Hualian Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 1:30 PM on the 22nd to continue negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Regarding the detailed items that Foreign Minister Hirota had presented to the Soviet Union twice on the 5th and 15th of this month, the ambassador avoided answering immediately and agreed to request instructions from his government again. The meeting lasted for one and a half hours before he left. The main points of this negotiation are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of payment methods: The Japanese side insisted that the guarantee by the Japanese banking group was sufficient. The ambassador argued that the guarantee for current funds and commodity prices should be in the form of obtaining public bonds. (2) The issue of transfer: Although the Japanese side agreed to remove the consulate and its affiliated items, it did not agree that hospitals, clubs, libraries, and other items should be excluded. The ambassador argued that all items affiliated with the consulate should be owned by them. (3) The issue of the list of lending targets: The Japanese side insisted that the list of lending targets after March was absolutely necessary. The ambassador said that the portion submitted in March of this year was sufficient, and the current lending status was already known to the "Manchukuo" side. (4) The issue of the period for commodity payment: The Japanese side advocated for three and a half years, while the Soviet side advocated for two and a half years. (5) The issue of treaty preparation: When an agreement is reached, the full text of the treaty should be prepared in Japanese, Russian, and "Manchukuo" languages. If there is any doubt about the wording, the Japanese version should be the basis. Both sides expressed agreement on this point. (Rilian Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Hungary and Poland Prepare for Friendly Negotiations and Treaty Signing</h3>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Returns Home via Vienna</p>
<p>Polish Government Awards the Order of the White Eagle</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös has been in contact with the Polish government for several days. The government has just issued a public statement, stating that Gömbös met with Prime Minister Kozłowski and Foreign Minister Beck. The atmosphere between the two sides was extremely harmonious. The current result of this meeting is to establish a Polish-Hungarian cultural and scientific agreement, following the precedent of Poland and Yugoslavia. Negotiations will be held again soon to conclude a consular treaty and an agreement on travel. In addition, a committee will be organized to promote trade between the two countries. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös arrived here the night before last and visited key figures in Polish politics. Today, the Polish government awarded him the "White Eagle" Medal, which is the highest-ranking Polish medal. This event shows how warmly Warsaw received Gömbös. A public statement was issued tonight, expressing mutual sympathy. However, it stated that the current result of Gömbös' visit to Warsaw is only the establishment of a cultural and scientific agreement, similar to the one concluded between Poland and Yugoslavia. Therefore, Gömbös' visit is only to demonstrate mutual willingness in a friendly manner. Gömbös acknowledged that Poland "should occupy a position among the world's great powers," while Polish Prime Minister Kozłowski said, "All international solutions that do not take into account the economic interlocking relationships of Central and Eastern Europe are in vain." This is Hungary's wording against the Little Entente, and the Polish Prime Minister also mentioned it. Tonight, Gömbös gave a speech to the press, stating that Hungary and Poland are the vanguard of Western and Christian civilization and bear a common mission in history. Gömbös also said, "Napoleon once said that Poland is the key to the European edifice, and Hungary is the pillar of this edifice." This statement is indeed true, he said. Gömbös is scheduled to go to Krakow tomorrow, and then return to the Hungarian capital via Vienna. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany Sends Overtures to Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Expressing a Desire for Further Cooperation</p>
<p>Unwilling to Repeat the Mistakes Before the Great War</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prussian Prime Minister General Göring made a surprising statement to the Yugoslav Political Daily, saying that the new Germany is currently only paying attention to its own interests and will never repeat the mistakes of being used by others in 1914. In his words, Göring greatly appreciated the very positive impression of Belgrade because the Yugoslav people, military police, and police were all very excellent. He hopes that the two countries can cooperate more closely in the near future and hopes to visit Yugoslavia again next spring. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Policy Direction of the New Yugoslav Cabinet</h3>

<p>(Belgrade) Prime Minister Udovički recently made a statement to the press, stating that the fundamental principles of the government's policy are no more than four: (1) Maintaining monarchical politics; (2) Loyalty to the current royal family; (3) Maintaining unity; (4) Maintaining the country's current organization. As for "diplomatic policy, it is to unite with allied countries to maintain peace and preserve the situation created by the peace treaty." He also said that the tasks of the previous political parties have now ended. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

The First Regent Prince Paul summoned the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kumanudi, and the Speaker of the Senate, Tomašević, to discuss the matter all day. As a result, former Prime Minister Udovički was still ordered to organize the new cabinet. There will likely not be much change in the cabinet members. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Accomplices Continue to Be Apprehended in France Regarding the Marseille Assassination</h3>
<p>Leader of Terrorist Group Under Interrogation</p>
<p>Extradition to France Will Take Time</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reports, another person has been arrested in Dieppe (on the sleeve coast in northern France), named Altug Keviczky, one of the accomplices in the Marseille murder case. Born in 1889, he carries a Hungarian passport, on which the name written is Altug Keviczky, one of the most dangerous members of the terrorist group "Vaszcsalisták." He has committed many crimes. In Austria, he attacked international trains heading to Yugoslavia. He had two accomplices during the train robbery, one was Pospisil, who was arrested in France for the Marseille case, and the other was Kvaternik, who was arrested in Italy for the Marseille case. Altug Keviczky was sentenced to ten months in prison. Recently, he was in London. The French police specially negotiated with the British Central Detective Agency "Scotland Yard," and he was deported. He was arrested when he crossed the sea to France. After investigating what he did between December 14, 1933, and October 1934, it will be clear. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Turin, Italy) Italian police have consistently refused to announce details of the arrest of Pavelić and Kvaternik, the leaders of the Croatian terrorist group. The examining magistrate of Marseille, France, has requested that the two be extradited to France for trial. It will likely take several weeks before this can be done. Although Italian law stipulates that the crime of murdering foreign heads of state and politicians is sufficient grounds for extradition, it must be approved by the Court of Appeal before the Minister of Justice can grant permission. This procedure takes a lot of time. According to reports, Pavelić and Kvaternik hid their identities and lived in Milan and Turin. After receiving a radio message from the French police, the Italian police arrested the two within 48 hours. Their swiftness is admirable. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Turin, Italy) Italian authorities interrogated Pavelić and Kvaternik, the leaders of the Croatian terrorist group. As a result, they completely denied participating in the Marseille murder case, saying that they had not issued any orders, had not been to France for many years, and had never met the people arrested in France. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Belgrade) The newspapers here strongly criticized Italy for the assassination of King Alexander. For example, Vreme wrote that French spies in Turin still failed to see the arrested suspects Pavelić and Kvaternik. Politika also said that Italy's investigation of the Marseille tragedy was intentionally obstructing it. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Minister to Hungary Requests Assistance in Apprehending Murderers</h3>

<h3>Declaration by the Gold Bloc Causes Currency Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>(London) The declaration by the Gold Bloc to maintain the gold content of their currencies is the reason for the rise in the prices of the French franc and the US dollar this morning. However, the decline of the British pound is generally considered only temporary because the Beijing Agreement does not contain mutual assistance measures. Italy's paper money reserve is now only slightly higher than 40% of the statutory amount because Italy is exporting gold to offset its trade deficit. Furthermore, the movement to devalue the Dutch currency seems to be gaining momentum. It is reported that only France and Belgium had concrete plans to propose at the Beijing meeting. Today, the Financial Times stated that any European country that abandons gold will join the Sterling Bloc, and the result may be that Europe will restore the gold standard under the Sterling flag. China is currently trying to join the Sterling Bloc, following the steps of Japan, Argentina, and Brazil. The Chinese government's recent order to increase the silver tax has caused the exchange market to fluctuate drastically in an artificial way, which is very detrimental to trade.

<h3>Hurricane on the US West Coast</h3>
<p>Ships Lost, Traffic Disrupted</p>

<p>(Seattle) This area was hit by a hurricane tonight. The hurricane's speed is 95 miles per hour. Shipping and telegraph and telephone communications have suffered heavy losses. Airlines have also been suspended. It is reported that 11 people have died, two of whom died from touching fallen power lines. The cargo ship Fullerida has run aground.

The steamer Harvest was sunk in a collision, but 20 crew members swam to shore and were rescued. The steamers Aleutian and North Haven were also damaged in collisions. In addition, the steamer Virginia was blown away, but all 30 of its sailors were rescued. One fishing boat had five people fall into the water, but only two were rescued.

Although Manila was the first to bear the brunt of the typhoon last week, it was spared this time. The hurricane swept from the sea towards Camarines Sur province late Saturday night. The wind was strongest at noon on Sunday. Traffic in the affected provinces was disrupted. There are few reports from the disaster area, but it is reported that at least four people died in Naga. At the same time, it is estimated that property losses have exceeded one million pesos. The Philippine Senate today passed a million-peso typhoon relief fund. The bill has now been submitted to the Governor for signature. The bill has already been passed by the House of Representatives. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Students Banned from Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Red-Light Districts Suddenly Become Desolate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has only been half a month since the police department strictly prohibited students from entering the red-light districts, and many cafes, taverns, dance halls, and other places have been hit hard. In particular, businesses in student districts have suffered a great impact. If they continue to maintain their businesses in this way, they will decline, and waiting for bankruptcy is obvious. Therefore, many merchants in the same industry are now successively applying to the Metropolitan Police Department to change their policies. As of the 22nd, as many as 600 special restaurants (the general term for cafes, taverns, etc. with female staff) have applied to change to ordinary restaurants. Although students have been prohibited from entering this path, it is clear that merchants have been hit hard in their business. At the same time, it is clear that the red-light districts in Tokyo have always been taken care of by students and have been exposed until now. (Rilian Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>England-Australia Air Race</p>
<h3>Comet Arrives in Darwin Harbor After Flying Through the Treacherous Timor Sea Section</h3>
<p>Venturing Towards the Destination with Damaged Aircraft</p>
<p>Dutch Aircraft Rush to Catch Up from Java</p>
<p>Morrison Couple Withdraw Midway</p>
<p>British Officer Gilman Dies in Crash</p>
<p>(London) On the third day of the England-Australia air race, two things were shocking. One was the withdrawal of the Morrison couple due to aircraft damage, and the other was that the aircraft driven by Scott and Black arrived in Darwin Harbor at 11:08 AM this morning, which can be called magical. Unfortunately, their aircraft "Comet" now needs major repairs. Whether it can complete the entire journey in time and win the championship is now a question. According to Scott's interview with Reuters, one engine was damaged in the Timor Sea, so they only flew for two and a half hours with one engine.</p>
<p>The Dutch aircraft Douglas, which ranked second, arrived in Batavia at 10:36 AM. They landed in Alor Setar in the northwest corner of Malaya seven hours ago and resumed at 4:07 AM.</p>
<p>Flying 400 miles and landing in Singapore at 7:02 AM, they urgently refueled and inspected the aircraft, spending 32 minutes. Then, at 7:34 AM, they resumed flying to Darwin Harbor, 2,084 miles away. Then the weather turned bad and there was wind and rain. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Darwin Harbor) British aviators Scott and Black arrived here first in the England-Australia long-distance flight competition. One of the two aircraft engines has been damaged. According to Scott, the engine malfunctioned while flying over the Timor Sea, but they still tried to continue moving forward. If repairs are not possible in time, they will try to fly to Melbourne with the power of only one engine. At 1:35 PM (Greenwich time), the two have already flown out and set off for Melbourne. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) British aviators Scott and Black are one of the fastest groups in the England-Australia long-distance flight competition. The two arrived at Darwin Harbor, Australia, at 12:08 AM (Greenwich time) this morning. From the time they departed from London, the journey took a total of 52 hours, 33 minutes, and 30 seconds, which is 4 days, 13 hours, and 11 minutes less than the record set by Australian aviator Ulm. Assuming they flew in a straight line, their average speed per hour was 281 kilometers. However, the two stopped four times along the way, each time for more than an hour, and the flight did not follow a straight south line, so the actual speed was more than this number. Scott and Black are now flying intermittently towards Melbourne. The next fastest are Dutch aviators Asjes and Geysendorffer. American aviators Turner and Pangborn arrived at Alor Setar on the Malay Peninsula at 10:51 AM (Greenwich time) this morning and are ranked third. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Continued telegram: American aviators Turner and Pangborn narrowly escaped an accident when they landed in Baghdad yesterday morning. They departed from Allahabad at 11:45 PM last night and arrived at Alor Setar at 10:45 AM this morning, leaving only four minutes before continuing their journey.</p>
<p>Among the remaining aircraft, the aircraft driven by Wright arrived in Athens today. It flew from Athens to Nicosia at 2:15 AM and continued forward at 9:10 AM. Lieutenant Shaw arrived in Athens at 10:55 AM this morning. Military officers Davis and Hill flew out of Athens at 3:55 AM and arrived in Nicosia three and a half hours later. Australian young aviator Melrose flew out of Nicosia at 6:45 AM this morning. British aviators Jones and Waller were stranded in Karachi due to fog and finally flew out at 4:15 AM this morning, arriving in Allahabad at 8:32 AM. Lieutenant Hansen departed from Alipore last night and arrived in Baghdad at 9:44 AM this morning. Hewitt and Kay flew out of Baghdad at 7:30 AM this morning. McGregor and Walker flew from Bushire to Karachi at 12:30 PM this afternoon. Three other aircraft flew out of Rome in the early hours of today. The aircraft driven by Brookes is still stranded in Bouches, France, due to severe engine damage.</p>
<p>There were originally 20 aircraft participating in the race, but now there are only 13 left. The Morrison couple's aircraft withdrew today, as did two Dutch aircraft, one driven by Asjes and Geysendorffer, and one driven by Bralle and Heimswijk. Another was the aircraft driven by Steinke and Tentler. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Allahabad) After arriving here safely, the Morrison couple announced that they had withdrawn from the race. One of their engines was severely damaged, and the cylinder head was also burned through. However, the couple still said that if they could find new parts to repair the aircraft, they would still continue moving forward. Before they departed from Karachi last night to come here, they were still full of hope of winning. However, due to getting lost, they landed in Jabalpur, which is 830 miles east of Karachi and 200 miles southwest of Allahabad.

<p>(London) In the England-Australia air race, the Comet driven by British aviators Scott and Black is still in the leading position. In less than 40 hours after departure, it has flown approximately 7,063 miles. The progress yesterday was particularly amazing. After leaving Allahabad at 10:15 AM, it arrived safely at the third stop, Singapore, at 10:30 PM, flying 2,210 miles. This was the first sea crossing in the journey. After arriving, they hurriedly refueled and carried supplies. Then, at 11:42 PM, they took off again and headed towards Darwin Harbor, Australia, which is one of the most dangerous sections of the entire journey, measuring 2,084 miles and requiring passage through the shark-infested Timor Sea. When the Comet landed in Singapore last night, it was in danger of capsizing due to a sudden change in wind direction. According to Scott's interview with Reuters, it was very difficult after departing from Allahabad, but the engine was working very well. They could have arrived in Singapore earlier, but they decided to reduce speed to avoid overworking the engine and to land during the day. They now hope to reach Darwin directly without stopping.</p>
<p>The Dutch aircraft Douglas is in second place but is many hours behind the Comet. The pilots Parmentier and Moll still hope to be in the lead. The aircraft flew from Allahabad to Calcutta at 5:40 PM and arrived in Rangoon at 10:15 PM. Late yesterday night, it set off towards Singapore. Before departing from Calcutta, it told Reuters that they planned to land at every major airfield along the way. Although it would take longer, they still hoped to be in the lead. They now believe that Scott and Black are flying at full strength, which means that their engine is overworked. Parmentier said that the flight from Baghdad to Allahabad was very smooth, flying at an altitude of about 12,000 feet. He did not want to overwork the engine, but after Singapore, he planned to go all out. German woman Reitsch, who was on board the aircraft, praised Parmentier and Moll's aviation skills. She also said that they spent four minutes because a passenger landed in Allahabad. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Xiamen Foreign Exchange Soars After Silver Export Tax</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Up Over 70 Yuan Per Thousand</p>
<p>Some Foreign Exchanges Up Over 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the Ministry of Finance issued the order to tax silver exports, Xiamen's foreign exchange has soared. For over sixty years, Xiamen has been a port with a trade deficit. In the past five or six years, the trade deficit has reached 20 to 30 million customs taels. Imports are usually eight times greater than exports, with typical annual imports of over 30 million taels while exports are only about 4 million. Initially, remittances from Southeast Asia were about 20 million yuan per year, which largely offset the deficit. Last year, overseas Chinese remittances decreased significantly, leading to a major commercial depression. Foreign exchange and foreign currencies have consistently been at a high peak. This is because the consumption in Xiamen and southern Fujian is mostly of foreign goods, and merchants buy foreign exchange to procure goods. This summer, as silver prices rose, silver and money shops transported large amounts of silver to Hong Kong to purchase British pounds and US dollars to offset foreign exchange. In the three months from July to early October, over 5.6 million yuan worth of silver was exported. At the end of August, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce once discussed prohibiting silver exports, and the foreign exchange rate immediately rose. Later, the plan was dropped due to opposition from the money shop guild, and the foreign exchange rate was able to return to normal. This time, the Ministry of Finance levied a silver export tax. After the Customs received the telegram from the Fujian Provincial Government, it immediately issued a notice in accordance with the order. However, due to the heavy tax, silver exports naturally disappeared, and the foreign exchange rate soared again. As for the market conditions in recent days, comparing the market conditions on the 13th, which was the day before the tax was levied, with the market conditions on the 18th after the tax was levied (both calculated per thousand yuan), the foreign currency price increases were as follows: Hong Kong currency increased from 1102 yuan to 1800 yuan, an actual increase of 78 yuan; Philippine currency increased from 1370 yuan to 1500 yuan, an actual increase of 130 yuan; Singapore currency increased from 1580 yuan to 1670 yuan, an actual increase of 90 yuan; Annam currency increased from 1780 yuan to 1875 yuan, an actual increase of 95 yuan; Siamese currency increased from 1280 yuan to 1350 yuan, an actual increase of 70 yuan; The Japanese gold ticket, which originally could purchase 1287.5 yuan of Japanese gold per thousand yuan, increased to only purchasing 1120 yuan, an actual increase of 167.5 yuan. The foreign exchange rate, according to the Bank of China's listing, the Hong Kong exchange rate increased from 1101.5 to 1175 yuan (calculated per thousand yuan). The Philippine telegraphic transfer increased from 75.375 to 63.25, the Java telegraphic transfer increased from 54.75 to 48, the Singapore telegraphic transfer increased from 65.625 to 57, and the Rangoon telegraphic transfer increased from 102.125 to 89.5 (the above telegraphic transfers are all calculated by converting 100 yuan of national currency into foreign currency). Furthermore, the US dollar listed by the Central Bank increased from 37 yuan and 50 cents to 33 yuan, 33 cents, and 7.5 (calculated per hundred yuan). It can be seen the impact after the silver export tax was levied. (October 19th)</p>
<h3>10,000 Mu of Tobacco Planted in Hui'an, Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Farmers Influenced by Local Scoundrels</p>
<p>County Government Prohibitions Ineffective</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Fujian Province is an area where opium cultivation is prohibited. The Nanchang Headquarters has issued strict orders to Fujian that anyone who plants opium will be subject to the death penalty. Therefore, various counties are conducting extremely strict inspections. However, the people of Fujian have been misled by the fact that the Fujian Provincial Anti-Smoking Inspection Office has been recruiting merchants to sell special goods, and various counties have been established. They mistakenly believed that special goods could be sold, and tobacco seedlings could also be planted. According to news from Hui'an, it is now the time to plant tobacco seedlings, and people in various parts of Hui'an are planting them in large numbers. The farmers of Hui'an, deceived by the one or two local scoundrels who had previously contracted for tobacco seedling donations, believe the counter-propaganda that special goods can be sold publicly and tobacco seedlings can be planted. Many are stubbornly persisting. The Hui'an County Government confiscated hundreds of buckets of water used by farmers to irrigate tobacco seedlings a few days ago, but it was still ineffective. Investigations show that the following areas within the county have planted tobacco seedlings: Houkeng Township in northern Hui'an has over 300 mu, Fengqi Township has about 200 mu, Thirteen Townships has about 500 mu, Siguxiang Township has about 500 mu, Xudai Township has about 200 mu, Three Townships has over 100 mu, the entire area of Tuling with 53 townships has about 1,000 mu, Nine Townships has over 300 mu, Nanpu Township has over 400 mu, Ciyao has over 200 mu, Lingtou has over 400 mu, Gangxi Nan Village, Kezhai, Panzuo, and E'tou areas have about 700 mu, Batou has 200 mu, Yanyaobei over 100 mu, Eighteen Townships has over 200 mu, Xialupai has 300 mu, Tukeng has over 200 mu, Sanchen has over 500 mu, Shicuo over 100 mu, Linbing has 100 mu, and Tianshefeng has 200 mu. Statistics show nearly 7,000 mu. In addition, in the Zhangkeng, Dawu, and Xingcuo areas of eastern Hui'an, there are also more than 3,000 mu planted, totaling more than 10,000 mu. As for the western part of Hui'an, it is even more self-evident. Historically, Hui'an, Quanzhou, has been a tobacco-producing area, and its people are strong and have always been known as difficult to govern. Therefore, the farmers there disregard the law and openly plant tobacco. (October 19th)</p>
<h3>Desperate Autumn Harvest in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>| Even Drinking Water is a Problem |</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the heavy rain on the seventh day of the fifth lunar month in Jiangxi Province, there has been no continuous heavy rain for five months to date. Although there have been occasional showers in various places in the interim, due to the short duration and uneven distribution, they are merely a drop in the bucket. It is now late autumn, and winter is approaching. Farmers have reached the time for the final reckoning. Statistics for the whole year show that only half of the early rice in high-lying areas survived. The mid-season rice completely dried up, and the late rice was not transplanted at all. In areas near water, although the early rice was not damaged, more than half of the mid-season rice died, and only three or four tenths of the late rice was saved. According to reports from various places, the autumn harvest is completely nonexistent, and dry crops cannot be planted either. Green manure such as flowering plants, which are planted in the autumn, have not been sown at all. The cracked fields are a vast expanse of white, evoking the lament of "no green grass in the fields." No matter where, the lakes, harbors, ponds, and weirs are all dried up. Most of the wells are also dry, except for those with springs. Drinking water is extremely difficult in various places, so the food situation is causing great panic among the people.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Vegetable Merchants Request Abolition of Vegetable Export Tax</h3>
<p>Since the Vegetable Tax was Collected</p>
<p>40% of Vegetable Merchants have Gone Bankrupt</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has the most miscellaneous taxes in the country. In addition to national and provincial taxes, there are also municipal taxes. The most notable municipal taxes in Guangzhou are the vegetable export tax and the fruit entry tax. The vegetable export tax is the most painful for farmers and merchants. Since it was first levied in September of the 21st year of the Republic, vegetable merchants have suffered great losses. In recent years, all industries have declined, and goods exports have sharply decreased, but the Guangzhou vegetable export tax is still levied as before, making it even more difficult for vegetable merchants to survive. Therefore, on the 11th of the month, they convened their colleagues to discuss and appeal for the abolition of this miscellaneous tax in order to maintain their livelihoods. It was decided to telegraphically request the higher authorities to quickly abolish the vegetable export tax to relieve the merchants' hardship. The second step is to hold a large-scale petition to achieve their goal, and they plan to draft a telegram requesting the abolition of the tax, which states, "Our vegetable stall merchants and farmers throughout the province have been suffering from the Guangzhou vegetable export tax for three years now. All kinds of abuses, such as the very cumbersome tax reporting procedures, are often penalized for slight errors, often causing the goods to spoil and losing their capital. It is unknown how many people have suffered such losses. Statistics for the past few years show that over 40% of our vegetable stall operators have gone bankrupt, and countless workers have lost their jobs, truly breaking all previous records. On the one hand, they are affected by the economic downturn, and on the other hand, they are oppressed by heavy taxes, inevitably leading to bankruptcy. Our colleagues have already tasted this bitter experience. After much pain, we have no choice but to jointly appeal to the authorities to abolish the Guangzhou vegetable export tax, which harms merchants and farmers, but we have not yet been approved. The decline of our industry is already obvious, but the authorities have not bothered to consider the suffering of our farmers and merchants. In this autumn of global economic recession, how can our Guangdong be an exception? The sluggish commercial situation goes without saying, and our colleagues have also been affected by the decline of the countryside in recent years. If we are further oppressed by heavy taxes, we will inevitably all perish together. Our country's production is backward, and we should be supporting agriculture instead of ruthlessly levying heavy taxes to destroy it. In short, the vegetable export tax is directly enough to sentence our colleagues to death, and indirectly it hinders agricultural production. Our colleagues have no choice but to strongly request the authorities to abolish the tax in order to save the farmers and merchants from danger. We hope that you will maintain it and immediately order the abolition of this vegetable export tax, so that the fish trapped in a dry rut can be revived, and we will be grateful, and agriculture will be fortunate."

<p>Northwest Inspection Report by our special reporter, Geng Ya</p>
<h3>What Was Seen After Departing from Longxi</h3>
<p>Since Lanzhou to Suzhou, in recent years there has been a merchant operating automobiles, using the main road to transport passengers and goods. However, most of the goods transported east to Suzhou and west to Pingjin are carried by camels from Mongolia, so the automobile business is particularly sluggish. If traveling by large cart, the price per cart is about three silver dollars per travel day and one dollar per rest day. According to the postal station route, it takes eighteen days to reach Suzhou. If going beyond the pass to Xinjiang, one must change carts in Suzhou. The reporter returned to Lanzhou from Qinghai, just as the Tianjin Huamei Company had five cars coming from Xi'an, planning to continue westward, going beyond the pass to transport sheep intestines. Therefore, I contacted them for a ride and set off on July 15th.</p>
<p>We left Lanzhou North Gate in the morning, passing Zhenyuan Bridge, commonly known as the Yellow River Iron Bridge, which is thirty yards long and twenty-three feet wide. The river water comes from the west and flows eastward, the bridge spanning north and south, a magnificent engineering feat. During the Ming Dynasty, twenty-four boats were used to float rafts to carry vehicles and horses. It was not until the first year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty that this bridge was rebuilt. Last month, a sedan car coming from Ningxia to Lanzhou was charged a dime for bridge repair when crossing the bridge. Also, when returning from Qinghai through Xiguan here, I was also asked to pay a "jiawozi" donation of five dimes. This time, the automobiles started from South Gate, then Xiguan, then North Gate, then Zhenyuan Bridge, moving majestically. Everywhere we went, people just moved to the sides. I never heard anyone asking for donations. This is simply because the American flag with thirteen stripes and forty-eight stars was fluttering at the head of each car. Suddenly, I remembered that when I went to Qinghai last time, no one checked the inns at any of the stops, which gave me a sense of peace in the villages. When returning, although the scenery was the same, the innkeepers called us "old customers." But at each stop, especially in the area where Gansu and Qinghai meet, a group of military police, seemingly descended from the sky, closely questioned our passports (besides the reporter, there was also a doctor from Qinghai Zhongshan Hospital and a Zhang-surname itinerant photographer from Lanzhou, all of whom were Chinese). They also collected police donations, which could not help but make one sigh, "It's easy to go, but hard to return." Now that American cars (of the five drivers, four were with high noses and blue eyes) drive into our heartland as if entering a no-man's land, it dawned on me that the ease of going to Qinghai was indeed due to the protection of the British and American tobacco company employees, Mr. Ba and Mr. Di.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge and traveling west for about a mile, we exited Jincheng Pass. Along the north bank of the Yellow River, date forests stretched as far as the eye could see, and the waves of wheat were lovely. After ten or so miles, we turned into the northwest mountain gorge. From then on, we no longer saw the Yellow River. The road traveled through sandy pits, winding and flat. If it rained, we should beware of mountain floods. The peaks on both sides were rugged and bare, without a single tree. In the middle, there was a mountain that looked like a Western-style building, with the bank collapsed like a wall and grass covering it like a roof, which was quite interesting. Ten miles away was Zhujiajing, with forty households. They farmed on flat sandy land, growing melons, wheat, and poppies. There was a small school in the temple, teaching both the Four Books and science. Thirty miles away, we climbed up a slope, then zigzagged down slowly, and arrived at Yujiawan, with about thirty households. Nearby two or three postal stations lacked water sources. Residents dug deep cellars, with small openings and large bellies, and lined their surroundings with oiled mud without any gaps. When it rained heavily and mountain floods broke out, they raced to put the water into the cellars to use as drinking water, which they called "cellar water." The cellars for storing water did not interfere with each other. Families with large populations even had to dig several cellars in the fields. Each time after drawing water, they had to seal the opening. Travelers watering their horses had to pay ten copper coins per head. The water was yellow and unclean, and even the horses were reluctant to drink much. If wells were dug to find springs, they had to be dug more than two hundred yards deep, but the spring water obtained still tasted bitter and salty, and was inferior to the taste of the cellar water. If there was a prolonged drought without rain, not only would the crops fail, but people would also die of thirst. Elsewhere, eating depends on heaven, but here even drinking water depends on heaven, so the people's level of superstition is even higher than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Traveling west from Yujiawan for twenty miles, we reached Hajiazui, with over a hundred households. Forty percent of them were farmers, and sixty percent were salt miners. About a mile outside the village, the ground was covered with salt. It appeared after the rain, and could be obtained by digging and sweeping. Every hundred pounds were sold for thirty cents, but the salt tax was as high as two dollars and seventy cents. The annual tax could reach forty to fifty thousand dollars. Twenty miles away was Alkali River Shop, where people used dung bricks as fuel. Thirty miles away was Xujia Inn, with several water mills, also known as Xujia Mill. The soil was fertile, the forests were lush, and the clear springs flowed continuously, which was refreshing. Five miles away was Red Castle, a bustling market town in Yongdeng (Pingfan). There were guards at both the east and west gates. Ten miles away was Zhengjiadun, another ten miles was Qingbao Fortress, twenty miles was South Datong Post, thirty miles was Pingfan Old City, also known as Manchu City, and five miles was Yongdeng County. We stayed at the South Gate. That day, we traveled a total of two hundred and ten miles.</p>
<p>The city was built of bricks, over ten yards high. The next morning, I went into the city for a tour. The streets in the center were low and concave, and after the rain, they were filled with sewage. The residents' houses and courtyards were large and spacious, but all were old and dilapidated, with not a single new building. Under the eaves of the streets, male and female beggars lay huddled together, smoking. An atmosphere of age-old decline permeated the entire city. After leaving the city and returning to the inn, it was only nine o'clock in the morning, but the so-called newly arrived "flower girls" were already leaning against the doors of various inns, selling their smiles. Starting so early, one can imagine that there were no guests to entertain at night. According to the innkeeper, "The farmers and merchants living outside the city are busy all day long, still worried about having no clothes or food. How would they dare to seek pleasure with prostitutes? The civil and military officials living in the city, because the city gates are closed at night, are unable to go out and play. And there is an official decree that the flower girls are not allowed to enter the city to solicit customers, so their business is very bleak. It is very pitiful to look at them." From this, it is not difficult to see what Yongdeng's market is like. When ascending to a high place for a distant view, there was a green field with tall trees, flowers in full bloom, and abundant beans and wheat. The ancient saying "fertile land west of the river" was truly worthy of the name. However, it ultimately could not remedy the depression of the market and the bankruptcy of the rural areas. Is it not because the taxes are heavy and the "land" is of no benefit to the people?</p>
<p>After breakfast, we traveled in the rain, passing through a deep ditch five or six miles long and only six or seven feet wide, with slippery mud walls, where the car got stuck several times. It was commonly called "seventy-two trails where your feet don't stay dry," which shows how difficult it was to travel by car. After the ditch, we climbed up to a bank road, where there was a village called Machanggou, ten miles from the city. The village women came out to watch when they heard the sound, all covering their mouths and noses, as if quite shy. Then we reached the Zhenqiang River, where the drizzle was incessant and the wheels were rattling, giving one the warning that "it is impossible to proceed." There was a wooden bridge, said to be "Wusheng Pass," with plaques at both ends, one saying "Road Leading to Xinjiang and Longxi" and the other saying "Peaceful Waves in Nine Channels." Crossing to the left bank, we could vaguely see a village hidden in the green willow trees, which was Wusheng Post. A rider came towards us, speeding past in the rain, looking hurried and attracting attention. After traveling about seven or eight miles, we saw a woman in her forties, completely soaked, panting and dragging a cane as she ran. But because she yielded to the side of the road for the car, she sat down in the mud and could not get up. The car also stopped at the postal station, as the road was slippery and difficult to travel. That day we only traveled forty miles. Amid the many discussions of the crowd, we learned that the rider who had passed by hastily was a tax collector, because he had come here three times to collect taxes, but the headman had no money to pay. The tax collector angrily whipped the headman, who fainted and fell to the ground. Therefore, he fled quickly, and the woman chasing after him was the headman's wife.</p>
<h3>The Riot of Farmers in Suzhou Is Pacified</h3>
<p>In Xietang Chefang, Weiting Waikuatang, and the suburbs of Loufengmen in Suzhou, farmers were dissatisfied with the wasteland reclamation and gathered to riot. From the 19th night to the 22nd, it was investigated that a total of 26 houses of tax collectors, etc., were demolished and burned, totaling 205 rooms, as well as more than 10 boats, 7 or 8 farm boats, and 400 to 500 piculs of rice. On the 21st night at 9:30, farmers from Xuanzhu Village and Beiwangdun Village on the edge of Yangcheng Lake, etc., also beat gongs to gather more than 100 people, from Weiting south to Fangjing Village, five miles east of Waikuatang along the Jinghu Road, preparing to beat up the house of tax collector Chen Shaolin. Fortunately, the farmers in this village refused to join and pleaded for Chen's exemption. This riot of farmers then changed direction to the northeast and arrived at the house of tax collector Cha Fengkui in Lujing Village, preparing to set it on fire. However, Cha Fengkui had always been enthusiastic about public welfare matters in the countryside and often made donations. The farmers in the nearby villages had automatically gathered at Cha's house from the 20th night to protect it. Cha also slaughtered two pigs and set up a wine feast to entertain them. When the rioting farmers rushed into the village, Cha's house was full of people eating and drinking heartily. Upon hearing the news, they each carried farm tools and went out to meet the enemy. Thus, a major melee broke out between the two sides. As a result, the rioting farmers were defeated and two people were injured. They were arrested and sent to the Weiting Police Station. Meanwhile, the county government secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest Lu Genshou, Shi Jinhu, Shi Shuangbao, Zhang Sifa, Zhang Jinlong, Wang Abing, Chen Genshou, and seven others in Waikuatang on the 21st night to the 22nd morning. Shi, as a village elder, confessed that on the 19th night at 7 or 8 o'clock, many people held a meeting at his house to discuss burning the tax collector's house. The remaining confessions were all forced to agree. On the 22nd, there were no accidents in the Chexie and other areas, and the riot was expected to be pacified. The provincial government had sent the first battalion and one company of the provincial security team, with 200 soldiers, to Suzhou on the afternoon of the 22nd to be stationed outside Loufengmen to deter the county government. The county government also found out that during this riot, the farmers in Chexie, Weikua, and other villages, in addition to using farm tools as weapons and beating gongs, also had police whistles. First, the A village sounded the police whistle to gather people, and then set off with gongs. When they reached B village, they handed the police whistle over to B village, and C village and D village passed it on in turn, called "snake molting," so the rioting area spread very widely.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Occurs in the Anti-Sporting Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Track and Field Team and the Suzhou Healthy and Beautiful Track and Field Team held an anti-sporting movement in Suzhou on the 21st. Unexpectedly, during the javelin competition, field judge Zhang Jihao could not avoid the javelin in time and was hit in the forehead. Blood was flowing at the time, and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Because the injury was quite serious, his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Opium from Wuxi Transported to Xi for Sale</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the three local opium shops of Yongxing, etc., have been very successful. The first batch of 5,000 taels of official opium was sold out in less than two days. Now they have applied to the provincial government to continue purchasing 15,000 taels of opium, and dispatched staff to transport it by ship to Jiangyin yesterday, and then transfer it to Wuxi by car. The county anti-smoking association sent staff to supervise the opening and sale of the boxes.</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Group Visits Xi</h3>
<p>Wang Jun, head of the Northwest Inspection and Travel Group, Wu _, deputy head, and group members Wang Zhizhong, Mark Xin, and others, a group of sixteen people, departed from Tianjin on August 25th. They first went to Jinan, Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places to inspect politics, economy, culture, education, agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, history, geography, products, and sanitation, etc., so as to learn from them for the development of the northwest. Then they went to Zhengzhou, Tongguan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Tacheng, Yili, Qinghai, and other places to inspect. The group arrived in Xi from Beijing yesterday and went to various places to inspect and visit schools and factories, staying for about a week before transferring to Suzhou. It is said that the group's inspection period is scheduled for two years, and the central party headquarters subsidizes 4,500 yuan for the required expenses, and their life is completely regimented.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Ship and Shoot Crew</h3>
<p>The ships on the Xueyanqiao waterway at the junction of Xi and Wu, traveling between Xi and Yi, often encounter bandit ships. Therefore, they agreed with the three ships of Luquqiao, Zhouqiao, and Panjiaqiao to meet in Zhangjin Town at about 5:00 pm every day and set off together. The day before yesterday evening, the four ships set off as usual, with the Xueyanqiao ship sailing in the lead. When they reached near Chendiangang at Yabaqiao, Shatangying, they suddenly encountered a bandit ship with nine bandits on board, with a six-inch Browning pistol. They went on board to rob. The Zhouqiao ship's crew Chen Genshou and Chen Ashou, two brothers, fought with the bandits. As a result, Ashou was shot in the waist, and Genshou was thrown off the bridge onto the shore by the bandits, suffering serious injuries. Chen Erxiao, a passenger on the Panjiaqiao ship, was strong and powerful, and also fought fiercely with the bandits. Due to being outnumbered, he was beaten and injured by the bandits. At that time, gongs were sounded loudly, and the villagers in the area all held farm tools to capture the bandits. They intercepted a bandit ship and caught _ bandits. The rest escaped. They were sent to the Zhangshe Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The injured Chen Ashou and Chen Genshou _ people were sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Ashou's life was in danger, but Genshou was not in serious condition.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Arson by Bandits in the Fourth District of Changzhou</h3>
<p>Tan Shengda's family in Huangjiatang, Chengshu Township, Fourth District of Wu Yi, was robbed by more than ten bandits on the night of the 18th of this month. Each held a pistol and flashlight, etc., and climbed over the wall to enter, wantonly searching and robbing, and arrested Tan Shengda, the victim, forcing him to hand over silver and property. When Tan refused to comply, they poured kerosene on his body and set it on fire, causing serious injuries to his waist and other places. After searching for about half an hour, they fled with the stolen goods. After the incident, Tan was swollen with injuries all over his body and died on the 20th. His son, Canhai, immediately rushed to report to the Fourth District Office to request the arrest of the thieves and the return of the stolen goods. The district chief Chen Yi reported to the county court on the 21st to request an autopsy. Personnel were dispatched to the countryside today (the 22nd) for an autopsy to facilitate the arrest.</p>
<h3>Villagers Stealing Reeds in Jiangyin Wounded Corps Member</h3>
<p>In Kaihua Township, Qixu, along the Yangtze River at the junction of Wu and Cheng, Wang Shaodan owned hundreds of acres of reed fields. Because the reeds were often stolen by thieves, he raised funds to purchase four guns and hire four guards to watch over them day and night. Yesterday morning (20th), more than ten villagers from Xiagang Township hired a boat to steal reeds from that place. After being seen by corps members Wei Enliang and Yang Qingsong, they chased after them by boat. _ outnumbered, they were beaten by the villagers with shoulder poles, and one box gun was knocked into the Yangtze River. Wei was seriously injured and treated at Zhonghe Hospital. Wang Shaodan, the victim, reported to Yao, the captain of the water police, who led police to pursue and arrest two of the perpetrators, waiting to be sent to the team headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hai Bandits Land in Lusi, Nantong</h3>
<p>A large group of sea bandits from the coast of Jiangbei were defeated by government troops on the sea off Donglin Port. More than fifty of the remaining bandits fled to Lusi to land. The local merchants and residents, such as the families of Pan Xu, were robbed clean. The security team immediately went to intercept them. The bandits still retreated by boat and are being pursued.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Riverbank at Langshan Becomes More Severe</h3>
<p>The riverbank at Langshan has recently been severely impacted by the river tide, and the collapse is intensifying. The gardens operated by the late gentry Zhang Jian in the western foothills of Huangni Mountain have been demolished due to the proximity of the river flow in recent days. The tomb of the famous embroidery artist Yu Shenshou, which is cast with cement and steel bars, will also enter the river sooner or later.</p>
<h3>Villagers Petition for Huai River Diversion Work in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Merchants and residents of Chenjiaji in Yi County, because the area is conscripting labor to divert the Huai River, each township must pay 720 yuan in beach replacement money and provide 16 laborers. After this drought, the people's strength is truly insufficient. Therefore, yesterday (20th), they sent more than 20 representatives to the city to petition various party and government agencies.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Ban Competitive Sales by Stores</h3>
<p>Discounted competitive sales by stores are actually an improper act by merchants. The government, in view of this, has already banned and prohibited it. However, the stores in this city, whenever business is slow, use price reductions as a gimmick, disregarding the ban. In addition, since the beginning of autumn, some use the completion of a new house as a gimmick, some use the anniversary of one week to even twenty or thirty weeks as a gimmick, some use adding _ adding five to buy one foot and giving one foot as a gimmick, and even giving away gifts. In fact, they secretly increase the price, which is a kind of deceptive behavior towards customers and is not the way of trade. It is also heard that the provincial government has issued an order to the county, ordering the Chamber of Commerce and the Public Security Bureau to immediately implement a ban, prohibiting any more competitive sales behavior.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Construction Procedures of the Huai River Diversion Project into the Sea in Jiangsu Province - Lan Xianjun</h3>
<p>The harm caused by the Huai River in our country has been a long time coming. The three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan often have the worry of the Huai River flooding their fields and houses, especially Subei at the tail end, which suffers the most. The great flood of the 20th year of the Republic inundated more than ten counties along the _ River, turning them into a country of Ze. The huge loss was no less than tens of millions of yuan, because the Huai River invaded the _ Canal. Therefore, the Huai River Diversion Association is actively preparing for the implementation of the Huai River Diversion. The planned diversion of the Huai River is based on the principle of separating the river from the sea, and the sea route still takes the path of the abandoned Yellow River, in order to ensure safety and reduce resistance. However, the first phase of the project requires 16 million yuan, which is deeply felt to be difficult to organize. In order to achieve this as soon as possible, Jiangsu Province tried its best to raise funds and cooperate with the Huai River Diversion Association, and implemented the conscription according to the method of dredging the Liutang River, which shows the spirit of cooperation between the officials and people of Jiangsu, and the good plan of the long-term officials to benefit the people and eliminate harm. Once the Huai River enters the sea and the waterway is completed, the flood of Subei can be reduced, and the poverty of the people's livelihood can be changed, which is not the beginning of the happiness of our people. However, this project is huge, starting from Yangzhuang in Huaiyin to Taozikou, with a total length of about 170 to 80 kilometers, and about 60 to 70 million cubic meters of earth being excavated. The provincial government plans to handle it in two years, with 3 million yuan to be raised each year and more than 100,000 workers. In two years, the Huai River entering the sea project will be fully completed, and its planning is thorough, and the legal meaning is good, which is enough to be praised. However, yesterday I read in the newspaper that the Huai River entering the sea project is planned to gradually dredge eastward from Yangzhuang, and the beach cutting project from Qitao to Taozikou will be held in the second phase. I was surprised to hear this, and I did not dare to be shy and humbly put forward which Huai River project should be done first and which should be done later, hoping that the authorities will look into it.</p>
<p>Since the merger of the Huai and Yellow Rivers, the Yellow sand has been deposited, and floods have occurred from time to time. Since the Yellow River changed its course, the river has become increasingly silted up, but the current river is slightly lower in the eastern section than in the west. According to the measurements of the Huai River Diversion Association over the years, this is also the case. The road from Qitao to Yuhuangkou is long and difficult to dredge. It is better to cut the beach from Qitao to Taozikou, which is less expensive than entering the sea along the old road, and the water flow must be smooth. The Huai River Diversion Association plans to cut the beach from this section, which has a reason. According to the Huai River entering the sea project, it is 170 to 80 kilometers away. According to the terrain, it is more appropriate to first cut the beach to dredge the sea waterway. The provincial government's pre-scheduled plan is to complete the embankment of 80 to 90 kilometers in one year of construction. If the lower section is constructed, the river from Beisha to Taozikou will be unobstructed and unimpeded in one year. If so, the rainwater along the Yellow River in Huaihuai Lianfu will have no fear of stopping and storing, and even the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic will not overflow and cause disaster, and the danger of affecting the _ Canal can be reduced. Moreover, the millions of people along the Yellow River below Yangzhuang can be spared the fear of being submerged. If not, if the upper section is dredged, before the entire project is completed, it will not be possible to divert the water of the Huai River and inject it into the present. The river that is planned to be dredged will become a broken alley and an abandoned port. It cannot divert water or drain water. It is a waste. It must wait until the entire sea project is completed before its effect can be realized. In case of autumn floods, _ rain is a disaster. Now the unfinished river will be the confluence of four waters. The upper water cannot be blocked and the dyke will be breached and go downstream. The lower water cannot be blocked and not caused by a flood, then the flood of several counties along the coast will not only not be reduced compared to the past but also exceed it. If the authorities think about this, they will not invert the procedures and dredge from Yangzhuang. If the upper section is repaired, the effect of water conservancy will not be seen, but the real cellar has arrived, and the tragedy of the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic can be easily reproduced in the eyes of the people in several counties along the Yellow River. Therefore, I am familiar with the weight of the interests and gains and losses. This diversion of the Huai River into the sea project should be more appropriate to start construction from the lower section.</p>
<p>The area of wasteland in Subei is 8,100 square kilometers, which is about 13 million mu. However, the current economic strength of Jiangsu Province cannot fully carry out reclamation. Therefore, the provincial government decided to proceed in stages, dividing the area north of Jiaoxie to south of Xinyang Port as the first phase of the project, and the area north of Xinyang Port to south of Chenjiagang as the second phase of the project. However, only 6.35 million mu are reclaimed in the first phase, and the other vast and good soil wasteland will be left to the future, which is a pity. However, the wasteland from north of Xinyang Port to south of Chenjiagang accounts for more than two-thirds in the Huai River basin. This time, Jiangsu Province is working hard to assist in the diversion of the Huai River, which is not only enthusiastic about national construction but also has a huge relationship with itself. Last year, the Huai River Diversion Association estimated that after the completion of the Huai River Diversion project, Jiangsu Province can increase the production of 17 million dan of rice and 46 million dan of wheat every year. Although this is calculated based on the tributaries of the Huai River in Jiangsu Province and within its basin, the scope of its sea basin actually accounts for the majority. This vast _ land can be of great benefit to the people's livelihood, but the water conservancy project has not been carried out, and millions of acres of arable land have been turned into wasteland, causing the coastal people to be surplus and unable to make a living, or fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River, or even becoming bandits, affecting society, which is not insignificant. Therefore, it should be remedied urgently. Now Jiangsu Province is working hard to assist the Huai River Diversion Association, and imitating the example of dredging the Liutang River, conscripting labor and implementing the project, hoping to turn the wasteland into mature soil as soon as possible, which is very obvious. If the provincial government takes into account the overall situation, changes the intended meaning of the pre-scheduled Huai River entering the sea project, it may as well implement the project in the lower section. It can not only be said to the people of Jiangsu that the progress of wasteland reclamation in Subei should start from the scope of the second phase, but also avoid the delay of leaving the wasteland to the reclamation of the second phase. However, although it cannot be compared with the wasteland reclamation in the first phase, it can also make up for the shortcomings, which is not a small amount. Wouldn't it be beneficial to both the national economy and the people's livelihood?</p>
<p>Now, Jiangsu Province's diversion of the Huai River into the sea is said to be assisting the Huai River Diversion Association, but in fact, it is only based on the plans measured by the Huai River Diversion Association over the years, and the conscription and fundraising are all the responsibility of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Therefore, its construction procedures are also determined by its own weighing and handling, which is completely incomparable to those who rely on others. All things in the world cannot have both advantages and disadvantages. There must be harm in having advantages. If you can avoid harm and take advantage, then you will get it. Moreover, diverting the Huai River from the lower section not only has no harm in harming your neighbors but also has the benefit of reclaiming wasteland. Therefore, I dare not spare the cost of words and urge the authorities to act expediently and change the construction procedures of the Huai River diversion. What is the first result of my ignorance? I don't know what the high-minded people think.</p>

Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday to oversee everything. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>In order to build the Yuping Railway, the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces used the first phase of railway construction bonds and Yuping Road bonds, each worth 12 million yuan, to obtain a mortgage loan of 8 million yuan from banks such as the Bank of China in Shanghai, and a mortgage loan of 8 million yuan from the German Otto Wolff Materials Factory, totaling 16 million yuan. The mortgage loan from the German materials factory was signed on behalf of the lending consortium, which also kept all the mortgaged bonds in its custody. As for the loan agreement, the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces reviewed and revised the contract terms with the lending banks at the Bank of China in Shanghai on September 25. It was originally planned that the agreement could be signed immediately, but the signing was delayed until now due to negotiations with the German materials factory on the price of materials.</p>
<h3>Convening a Meeting</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company, having resolved the issue of material prices, convened a formal signing conference at 12:00 noon yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the Bank of China on the Bund, inviting the lending banks to attend. Those present included Zeng Yangfu, Chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company; Zhang Gongquan and Huo Baoshu of the Bank of China; Xu Xinliu of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank; Wu Yunzhai of the Jincheng Bank; Wang Zhixin of the Xinhua Bank; Xu Boyuan of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau; and Dr. Bick of the German Otto Wolff Materials Factory, among others, more than ten people in total. Zeng Yangfu first checked the full text of the contract item by item, and then the representatives of the banks formally signed the contract. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Signing Representatives</h3>
<p>There were two contracts signed yesterday: (1) Between the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company and the lending banks, signed by Zeng Yangfu, Chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company; Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China representing the banking consortium; Xu Xinliu of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank; Yang Jimei of the Shanghai Bank; Wu Yunzhai of the Jincheng Bank; Wang Zhixin of the Xinhua Bank; Xu Boyuan of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau; and Zeng Yangfu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Wu Jiantao, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, was absent and will sign later. (2) Between the banking consortium and the German Otto Wolff Materials Factory, signed by Zhang Gongquan representing the banking consortium and Dr. Bick representing the Otto Wolff Factory. Attached to the mortgage materials loan agreement was a material purchase agreement between the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company and the Otto Wolff Factory. This agreement specifically stipulated the types and prices of materials required and when they should be delivered. It was also signed yesterday by Zeng Yangfu and Dr. Bick.</p>
<h3>Agreement Content</h3>
<p>The agreement signed between the banking consortium and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company amounted to 8 million, with an interest rate of 1% and a repayment period of four and a half years. The mortgage material loan agreement also amounted to 8 million, with an interest rate of 0.7% and a repayment period of five and a half years. Interest will start accruing after the materials are shipped to China. The attached material purchase agreement fully specifies the types and prices of materials required and the dates for phased shipments to China. As for the method of repaying principal and interest, when the first phase of railway construction bonds and Yuping Railway bonds are drawn for redemption, the banking consortium will collect and save all the principal and interest corresponding to the winning numbers and distribute them to the respective banks. Any remaining amount will be returned to the government, as the banking consortium is responsible for keeping all the bonds in custody. After the above agreements are sent to the representatives of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank for signing, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company will submit them to the Ministry of Railways and then to the Executive Yuan for record-keeping.</p>
<h3>Lending Banks</h3>
<p>The loan was underwritten by a banking consortium organized by seven banks, including the Bank of China. The amount underwritten by each bank is as follows: Bank of China 3.75 million, Jincheng 1.5 million, Shanghai 1 million, Zhejiang Industrial 500,000, Xinhua 500,000, Jiangxi Yumin 500,000, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau 250,000, totaling 8 million yuan. The office of the banking consortium is located in the Bank of China.</p>
<h3>Shipping Materials by Telegraph</h3>
<p>This is the first time that the German Otto Wolff Factory has promoted its materials in China. The prices of various materials offered were negotiated and decided by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company with the factory representative several times, based on the standard prices of the Construction Committee's material purchasing committee. Therefore, the prices of various materials are cheaper than those of other countries. The factory also believes that China's construction industry is booming and expects that there will be many transactions between the two sides in the future, so it is happy to accept the lowest price offered by our country. Dr. Bick, the representative of the factory, reported the signing process to the German factory by telegraph yesterday after the contract was signed and instructed them to ship the first batch of materials to China as soon as possible for application.</p>
<h3>Recent Projects</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the Bank of China yesterday that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company had previously withdrawn more than 100,000 yuan from the Bank of China for surveying and excavation projects, which will be deducted from the loan in the future. Therefore, the Yuping Road project is progressing actively. The third section of the Yu-Nan section and the bridge project in Dongxiang and Jinxian are currently underway, and bids are being invited for construction. Once the German steel rails and sleepers are shipped to China, they can be laid.</p>
<h3>The Preliminary Agreement on the Huai River Project Loan from the Boxer Indemnity Fund Has Been Finalized</h3>
<p>The amount of materials is more than the current amount of funds, totaling 4 million.</p>
<p>Construction of the Sanhe Dam and the Huai River Estuary Project</p>
<p>The Huai River Commission has borrowed 4 million yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund for the construction of the Sanhe movable dam and the Huai River estuary project. According to a committee member in Shanghai who spoke to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the loan has been approved by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund General Assembly and a preliminary agreement has been signed. The canal shipping tax revenue will be used as the principal and interest repayment fund. Except for a small amount of current funds, the rest of the loan is in the form of materials. Once the formal contract is negotiated and signed, the purchase order will be sent to the British Purchasing Committee for purchase.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Stinson Aircraft Tested Blind Flying Yesterday</h3>
<p>The two-hour flight yesterday morning yielded satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The Guangdong aircraft will test-fly Fuzhou at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, in order to ensure flight safety, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) purchased blind flying equipment at a high price when ordering new aircraft from the United States. The equipment has been shipped to Shanghai with the new aircraft. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the equipment was installed on a Stinson aircraft and operated by a pilot recently sent to the United States to study blind flying. This experiment of flying an aircraft purely using scientific mechanical methods was the first in China. The aircraft took off from Longhua Airport at 9:00 AM. When it reached an altitude of 2,000 feet, the glass windows of the cockpit were covered with cloth. The direction, speed, and altitude were all determined by the blind flying instruments. Changes in weather pressure, wind force, and air thickness were recorded in detail at any time. The pilot only needed to control everything according to the instructions of the instruments. The blind flying test started at 9:00 AM and continued for two hours over Shanghai. At about 11:00 AM, it landed safely at Longhua Airport with satisfactory results. The two new aircraft prepared for the Shanghai-Guangdong route are equipped with this equipment. In the future, normal flights can be maintained even in dense fog or sudden weather changes.</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Aircraft Test-Flies Fuzhou</h3>
<p>According to the company's announcement yesterday, the Guangdong aircraft, which has been successfully test-flown for several days, will depart from Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning to test its long-distance flight capabilities to Fuzhou. It is expected to arrive at about 11:00 AM. If time permits, it is scheduled to fly back on the same day; otherwise, it will return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. The flight will still be piloted by Erickson and Searle. The company has also sent two staff members on board to arrange for the resumption of the Shanghai-Guangdong route. After arriving in Fuzhou, the Guangdong aircraft is scheduled to invite political and business circles in Fuzhou to visit and take a test ride on the same day. The company's other new aircraft, the Fujian, was also assembled yesterday morning at 9:00 AM and a test flight was held. The test flight lasted for more than two hours, and the results were also very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Opening a Qingdao-Tianjin Branch Line on the Shanghai-Beiping Line</h3>
<p>Recently, Xu Dongfan, the commissioner of Weihaiwei, earnestly requested CNAC to set up a航站航站 in Weihai, but because the route to that station is too far, it is difficult to achieve in a short time. However, the company believes that although there is not much mail in Yantai and Weihaiwei, there are many passengers traveling to and from these places in the spring and summer seasons, so it is possible to open a航綫航綫. It is currently planning to open a Qingdao-Tianjin航綫航綫, starting from Qingdao, passing through Yantai and Weihaiwei, and reaching Tianjin, as a Qingdao-Tianjin branch line of the Shanghai-Beiping line, in order to expand business. It is said that after the line is submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval, specific measures can be discussed and actively planned, so as to implement the opening of the line before the summer of next year.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yichen's Letter to the Ratepayers' Association on Election Opinions</h3>
<p>Using universal suffrage of citizens as the standard</p>
<p>Zhang Yichen and Zhang Xianfang, executive members of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession, wrote to the association to solicit opinions on the election regulations. The letter stated, "We have received your letter and learned that your association is studying the election regulations and has organized a special committee and solicited opinions from various representatives, which shows that your association attaches great importance to the election. The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association is a group of Chinese citizens in the concession and is the only organization for Chinese citizens' diplomacy, which is used to protect the rights of taxpayers in the concession. Its election is naturally limited to the qualification of paying taxes, which is very clear and there is no need for research. However, in the past elections, they were divided into groups such as the Tongxiang group, the business group, and the citizen group, etc., and the Tongxiang and business groups accounted for two-thirds of the number of representatives, which is not in accordance with the election law. Now that your association is improving the election regulations and putting forward research, it seems that it should be corrected to avoid malpractices. Because the members of these two groups are not only in the concession. For example, the Tongxiang Association and the Trade Association, regardless of Zhabei, the city, and the Chinese district, can join the Tongxiang Association if they are from the same hometown, and can join the Trade Association if they are in the same industry. Therefore, the members of these two groups are not limited by the Chinese concession and are composed of members with different addresses, which is not comparable to the citizen group in the concession. As for the election method, it is best to have genuine taxpayers in the concession elect half of the representatives through universal suffrage, and the other half should be elected from the candidates recommended by the citizen groups in the concession. The representatives produced by the two elections of the citizen universal suffrage group and the citizen group should periodically re-elect the Chinese directors, Chinese committee members, and executive members. If this method can be adopted, the procedures will be simpler, the nature will be consistent, and it will seem appropriate in terms of reason and law. The matter is related to the election administration and should be held legally. Since the election administration is important, it is even more related to the national system. We should put forward the above opinions and hope that your association will make a public decision to amend it for the convenience of the public."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Sent a Letter to the Municipal Government Requesting a Swift Resolution to Reduce Rents</h3>
<p>And attached five opinions</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city believes that reducing rents is an important strategy for prospering the market. After receiving a report from the First District Party Headquarters, it attached five opinions and sent a letter to the Municipal Government for review. The original text is recorded as follows: "The case is based on the report from the executive committee of the First District of the Municipal Council, which states that according to the report from the Twenty-seventh Branch, this city's people, due to the depression of all industries and economic bankruptcy in recent years, find it very difficult to maintain their lives. Therefore, house rent reduction committees have been organized everywhere in order to reduce the burden. As for the landlords, some voluntarily reduce rents in view of the depression, while most ignore the market situation and insist on not reducing rents, resulting in both parties going to extremes, disputes, and even fights and lawsuits, turning into tragedies. If this continues, there will be no peaceful days. In view of this, this branch submitted a resolution to the party members' general meeting, requesting the superiors to transfer the request to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to quickly stipulate rent reduction regulations in order to follow and stop disputes. It is reasonable to record the case and request review, etc. Based on this, the 93rd regular meeting of the affiliated association passed the resolution to forward the case, etc. In view of this, reducing rents is indeed an important strategy for prospering the market, and rent reduction disputes will affect the progress of municipal administration. Therefore, this association has attached five opinions: (1) Rent reduction is very urgent, but if the Municipal Government sets a universal standard and forces both parties to comply, it is impossible in terms of law and fact. (2) The remedy is only that the tenants in a unit (such as tenants in the same alley or the same object) should unite by themselves and make a request to the landlord to reduce rents. (3) In the process of rent reduction negotiations, party and government agencies should allow tenants to organize temporary groups to handle negotiations. The Municipal Party Headquarters should also try to lead them. (4) When the landlord and tenant cannot reach an agreement, both parties or either party should request the rent dispute review committee of the Municipal Government to investigate the production price and mediate based on the facts within 20 days. However, the rent determined by the review committee should not be higher than the current rent. (5) The disputed landlord or tenant may raise reasons for requesting a review of the decision of the review committee, but only once. The decision of the review is compulsory and both parties should obey it. Correspondingly, we hereby send you a letter, hoping that you will check and review it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<h3>Dr. Mari Arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>To report on the improvement of silk work</p>
<p>Dr. Mari, the League of Nations technical cooperation expert hired by the National Economic Council Silk Improvement Association, has been in China for almost a year to assist the association in improving silk matters. He has also been studying the mixed breeding of silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces with Italian silkworms in Hangzhou. The experimental results have been excellent.

<h3>Twenty-Six Organizations Petitioned the Judicial Yuan for Special Amnesty for Liu Chongwu and Others</h3>
<p>To be mailed to Beijing today</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Aid Patriotic Martyrs Committee, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Seven Counties of Shaoxing, the Nantong Fellow Villagers Association, the National Products Manufacturers Federation, the Citizens Federation of the First Special District, the Twelfth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-second, Seventeenth, Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, District Branches, Transportation Brick and Tile Occupational Union, South Goods Industry, Occupational Union, and other twenty-six organizations, in order to appeal for special amnesty for patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., jointly signed and sealed (the seals were completely affixed yesterday) a petition to the Judicial Yuan (to be sent by registered mail from the post office today). The original text is as follows: "Petition for patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., to be retried by the Supreme Court and still sentenced to severe punishment, causing public outrage. We beseech you to grant a special amnesty based on the original situation, in order to maintain the national spirit and comfort the people's hopes. Since Japan occupied the Northeast, poisoned Shanghai, and encroached upon China, its momentum has been unstoppable. The people of our country have endured this for a long time, because they are in pain from the impending doom of national subjugation and want to save the sinking situation. Soldiers vowed to fight hand-to-hand, merchants vowed to sever relations, and all matters that are beneficial to the country and resist the enemy rose up at the same time. Resistance to violence is the common desire of all people, and safeguarding the country is our unshirkable responsibility. In such circumstances, we would not hesitate to go through fire and water and would not allow for careful consideration and deliberation, as would be the case in peacetime when the advantages and disadvantages can be weighed in advance. In the winter of the twenty-first year, patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., were angry at the enemy-collaborating merchants and the dumping of enemy goods, which led to the decline of national goods and the despair of the people's livelihood. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, why not rise up and seek survival? However, there are many obstacles, and it is often difficult to achieve results. Therefore, even legitimate work can only be carried out in secret. The cause of the Liu case was entirely to be patriotic and protect national goods. However, the enemy-collaborating merchants were blinded by profit and actively bundled and sold enemy goods, so that national goods had no place to stand. They refused to be persuaded and were forced to use dangerous goods as a final warning. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out at one time, and a catastrophe flew in, resulting in being imprisoned and suffering injustice until now. This case was first filed by Kan Jingxian, a lawyer representing the Criminal Section of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department Police Department, to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. The first instance verdict was that Liu Chongwu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment with a three-year reprieve, and Tian Shuiyang was sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a three-year reprieve. Lawyer Kan was still not satisfied and appealed again for the crime of premeditated murder. In July of last year, the second instance verdict by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court overturned the original verdict. Liu, Pan, and Cao were all sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for conspiring to commit murder together. Tian Shuiyang was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for assisting in murder. At that time, people from all walks of life believed that the trial was inappropriate and convened an aid committee for patriotic martyrs, resolving that various groups should submit petitions to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Judicial Yuan for relief, and hired four lawyers, Ma Junteng, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Hualong, and Li Shirui, to appeal to the Supreme Court in order to show justice in each case. In July of this year, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial. The judgment of the retrial was that Liu Chongwu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Tian Shuiyang and Pan Hongsheng were sentenced to six years of imprisonment, and Cao Songshou was still sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. People from all walks of life believed that the sentence was still too heavy. The aid committee for patriotic martyrs convened an emergency meeting on the day of the incident and resolved that in addition to having the original lawyers file an appeal to the Judicial Yuan again, various groups should jointly sign a petition to continue to request relief. We find that the actions of Liu and others are indeed not allowed by law, but the purpose of Liu and others is indeed approved by the people of the whole country. In short, the loyalty of Liu and others to the country is obvious. It is neither a private feud nor a premeditated killing. The conscience of the people is still there, and justice still exists. We will never allow these patriotic martyrs to be imprisoned for a long time. If those who harm the country are still granted leniency, but those who love the country are punished with severe crimes, the gains and losses will be reversed, causing public outrage. The power to reverse the injustice lies with the superiors. In addition to hiring the original lawyers to petition your court to correct the situation according to the law, we hereby submit the facts again, begging your court to approve a special amnesty. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate."</p>
<h3>National and Private Shipping Industries Resolved Yesterday to Establish a Joint Transportation Joint Office</h3>
<p>To be attached to the China Merchants Bureau and submitted to the Ministry for filing</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways stipulated that private shipping companies should participate in the joint transportation, the state-run China Merchants Bureau was ordered by the Ministry to form a joint transportation joint office with various private shipping companies. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a national-private meeting was held at the Shipping Industry Association on Guangdong Road. Those present included He Molin and Zhou Fengtu of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, Cao Zijia and Shen Zhongyi of Sanbei, Ai Ludeng of Ningshao, Zhou Pingheng of Daxing, Zhu Angsheng of Hezheng, Chen Yisheng of Pingan, and Li Zhiyi, etc. It was resolved to establish a national-private joint transportation joint office, with the address attached to the China Merchants Bureau. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Joint Federation of Machine Industry Associations Requests Increased Import Tax on Molasses</h3>
<p>The Joint Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories of this city yesterday submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance and the National Tariff Commission, stating that they were submitting a report based on the actual situation, requesting an increase in the import tax on molasses raw materials to help rescue rural areas and maintain domestic goods. The report quoted a letter from the Meilong Perfume and Pharmaceutical Factory, a member of the federation, stating, "Our factory was established in the twelfth year of the Republic of China and specializes in the production of chemical drugs such as alcohol and menthol. It has been more than a decade since then, and we believe that we have achieved considerable results in the industry. However, since the Shanghai War, foreign goods, especially alcohol, have been continuously imported and dumped in large quantities. Taking Shanghai port as an example, the annual leakage amounts to more than 800,000 national currency, which is truly alarming. Alcohol is a necessity for the chemical industry and national defense. Our factory believes that only by expanding production can we resist foreign imports. Therefore, last year, we increased our capital and built a new factory at 802 Huishan Road, producing in large quantities to meet the needs of society. The raw materials for alcohol are extracted from agricultural products such as millet, corn, sorghum, yams, and wheat bran. Although the cost is high, at this time of rural collapse, if we can use domestic raw materials as much as possible to prevent goods from being discarded on the ground, the aid to rural areas will not be insignificant. In addition, foreign molasses is also a raw material for the production of alcohol. Foreign merchants, in order to break our country's agricultural production, deliberately lowered prices. In addition, the import tax rate on molasses is very low, only collecting 3.7 cents of Customs Gold per picul. In all countries of the world, the import tax rate is temporarily light if the raw materials are not available in the country and are necessary. However, when the country already has the same raw materials, the foreign import tax is immediately increased. This not only enriches the national tax revenue but also balances and adjusts to protect domestic raw materials from defeat. If we do not pay attention to this and allow foreign molasses to flood our country's markets, not only will industry be affected, but also the government's intention to promote the use of domestic raw materials will become a bubble. We have always admired your association's efforts to promote domestic goods. We earnestly request that you forward this report to the Ministry of Finance and the National Tariff Commission, requesting them to approve an increase in the import tax rate on foreign molasses to more than three yuan of Customs Gold per picul to show restrictions. This will be in line with the true meaning of rescuing rural areas and promoting completely domestic goods, which is a public feeling." The report also stated that the bankruptcy of rural areas is due to the discarding of goods and the decline of domestic goods is due to the reliance on foreign raw materials. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the promotion of agricultural products and the application of domestic raw materials, and want to rescue rural areas and promote domestic goods, it is truly abandoning the root and pursuing the branches, and will ultimately be of no help. The situation reported by the Meilong Perfume and Pharmaceutical Factory is of fundamental importance. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it, hoping that your association will review and approve the increase in the import tariff on molasses so that both domestic goods and rural areas will benefit. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Grand Gathering of the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association for a Public Banquet for People from All Walks of Life in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Hubei fellow-provincials in Shanghai, including Tang Xiangming, Hu Zongduo, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Wenhui, Wu Xingya, Guan Jinzhi, Wang Shaocheng, and others, held a public banquet at the Gongdelin Restaurant for people from all walks of life in Shanghai due to the severe drought and flood situation in their home province. More than 50 people attended, including Xu Shiying, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Yuan Ludeng, Li Dachao, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Hongjun, Yu Zuoting, Huang Hanzhi, Jie Wenliu, Wu Yunzhai, Jin Yansun, Qian Jingping, and Zhang Zhuping. First, Chairman Wu Xingya reported on the disaster situation, saying that the drought and flood disasters in Hubei this year are extremely severe and unprecedented. The disaster area covers 48 counties, and the number of disaster victims waiting for relief reaches more than 3.5 million. Some have committed suicide by poison, and some have hanged themselves. The rest are lingering on their last breath, waiting to die everywhere. It is heartbreaking and shocking to hear. Hubei is the hub of the provinces, and Wuhan is the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Since ancient times, when Hubei is well-governed, the provinces benefit from it; when Hubei is in chaos, the provinces suffer from it. This year, the banditry has just been cleared, and suddenly such a strange disaster has occurred. In the coming three autumns, the disaster victims will not even be able to eat their fill. When winter comes, how can they live with hunger and cold? If relief is not sought quickly, I am afraid that ignorant people will take risks, affecting the bandit suppression plan. Thinking of this, I cannot help but shudder. Today, all of you guests are great philanthropists. I hope that you will have the heart to relieve the hungry and save the drowning, and make the wish to save people and save the world. Saving Hubei is saving China, and so on. Then, guest Xu Shiying replied, saying that he had just heard Chairman Wu's report and learned that the disaster situation in Hubei is very serious. The disaster area is so vast, and there are so many disaster victims. Since I am responsible for the Relief Association, I will convey the actual situation to the government and the Relief Committee and provide relief as soon as possible. In the future, if there are relief funds, I will allocate and distribute funds according to the disaster situation, and so on. Then, Municipal Government Secretary Yu Hongjun gave a speech, saying that he had just heard Chairman Wu's report on the serious disaster situation in Hubei, fearing that the outside world would not understand the truth and would therefore be indifferent. In the future, all sectors of society should know the severity of the disaster situation in Hubei, and so on. The rest, including Jie Wenliu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Zhiben, Guan Jinzhi, Hu Zongduo, and Wang Shaocheng, all gave extremely heartbreaking and painful speeches. The length is not recorded. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at 8 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Consultation on the Yellow River Breach Problem</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the Yellow River breach problem this year, the results of the consultation in Shanghai by the Hebei Provincial Government, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee are that the Hebei River Affairs Bureau is undoubtedly responsible for its ineffective defense. The three agencies have submitted separate reports to the Executive Yuan. Regarding the matter of blocking and building, the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau should refer to the four measures of the Flood Disaster Association and the plan proposed by the Water Conservancy Association, as well as the current actual situation, and formulate a blocking and repair plan within the scope of the project funds, and send it to the Flood Disaster and Water Conservancy departments for review and implementation. A Project Fund Management Committee should also be organized to manage the 200,000 project funds allocated by the central government and the Hebei Provincial Government. Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Work Relief Group, will be the Chairman, and Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Hebei Construction Department, and Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, will be the members. The Project Fund Management Committee was established in Bian on the 20th of this month, and the blocking project is being actively carried out.</p>
<h3>Departure of the Jishi Society's Zhenyuan Relief Team to Haining</h3>
<p>The China Jishi Society believes that the drought in Haining is particularly severe compared to other counties, with people selling their wives and children and fleeing, and the miserable situation is difficult to describe in words. The county is vast, divided into five districts, and the funds for disaster relief are severely limited, which is really impossible. After repeated consultations by the association, it reluctantly agreed with the Haining Drought Relief Association and the Chinese and Foreign Volunteer Relief Association to jointly handle emergency relief in districts three, four and five. The first and second districts were handled by the Hai Drought Relief Association, which allocated funds and entrusted the association to handle it. As for the fourth district, the Drought Relief Association requested the Red Swastika Society to handle it independently. It is reported that the Jishi Society has appointed Li Junyun as the director yesterday, and together with more than ten Zhenyou Relief Association members including Gu Yabin and Ma Jintao, will depart this morning to conduct on-site investigations and distribution in Haining.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Relief Association Strives to Levy Traffic Surtax with Taxes</h3>
<p>Letter Urges Representatives to Go to Beijing as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Relief Association sent letters to all representatives going to Beijing yesterday, asking them to go to Beijing as soon as possible to petition the authorities to strive for the levy of traffic surtax with taxes, in order to raise more relief funds. The letter said, "Respectfully, at the general meeting of all committee members of this association on October 17 this year, Standing Committee Member Jin Baishun and Standing Committee Member Feng Xueshu proposed that the Executive Yuan rejected the previous request of this association to levy traffic surtax with taxes. It is proposed to elect representatives to strive for it from the headquarters to make up for the lack of relief funds. After public election, Committee Member Chu Fucheng, Committee Member Wu Zhihao, Committee Member Shen Tianxin, Committee Member Zhang Xiaolin, Committee Member Yanfang, and other five people were elected as representatives, etc., and the record was filed. The corresponding copied and amended resolution is hereby sent to your Ning Committee for your reference. The matter concerns the hometown, and we sincerely hope that you will gather as soon as possible to go to Beijing to strive for it from the Yuanbu, and strive to achieve the goal in order to provide relief. We also hope that you will quickly reply with the results, and we will be extremely grateful."</p>
<h3>River Dredging in the County Has Been Surveyed</h3>
<p>The County Government Announces Suspension of Planting Small Crops Along the River</p>
<p>Shanghai County's general mobilization for river dredging this year has been approved by the provincial government after the county government investigated the rivers to be dredged in each district. Now that the county government is taking advantage of the agricultural slack season to carry out the construction and dredging according to the original construction procedures, it has dispatched surveyors such as Ling Jin to lead the surveyors to the rivers to carry out surveys, set up wooden stakes, and draw up plans. However, it has been found that tenants along the banks of the rivers have planted small crops. Now that dredging is imminent, the county government announced yesterday to the nearby farmers and businesses to stop planting small crops to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>The Navigation Administration Bureau Issues a Circular to All Shipping Companies to Crack Down on Crew Members Who Have Not Obtained Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications issued a circular to all Chinese shipping companies yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>"For your compliance, the instructions in the Ministry of Communications' No. 16847 Order state, 'Regarding Chinese and foreign crew members serving on Chinese ships who have not yet obtained certificates, they should be cracked down on by the end of this year. You should start registering unemployed crew members who have already obtained certificates for supplementary purposes. This is the order,' etc. Upon receipt of this order, it has been found that cracking down on Chinese and foreign crew members serving on Chinese ships who have not obtained corresponding certificates has been delayed due to the complicated procedures for applying for certificates and the inability to complete the examination on schedule. The ministry has repeatedly issued orders to extend the crackdown period to show consideration for all parties. Now, the extended deadline is approaching again in a blink of an eye. In order to maintain the safety of ships, this bureau will strictly comply with the ministry's order and carry out the crackdown after the deadline. It has also started registering unemployed crew members who have already obtained certificates for supplementary purposes, which was the reason for the order. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your company's reference. Within the deadline, all crew members who have not obtained corresponding certificates should be replaced to avoid this bureau issuing a deadline to replace them at that time, which may delay the sailing schedule and cause losses. Please note this order."</p>
<h3>Ye Jiaxing, Accused in the Xu Case, Has Been Certified by the Military Department as an Active-Duty Soldier</h3>
<p>The Judicial Department Has Been Informed and Ordered to Notify the Special Court</p>
<p>And to Review the Case Files for Verification</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, Ye Jiaxing, the former executive committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the current director of the Shanghai Office of the 26th Division of the Army, organized the Xu Case Support Association and advocated for justice for the case of Xu Yuying, a Ningbo girl, who accused Ji Juemi, the manager of the Hardoon Foreign Firm, of undermining public morals. He was prosecuted by Zhong Qing, the prosecutor of the First Special Court, for the crime of insulting a government agency and obstructing official duties. When Judge Zhan Liangce summoned him for questioning, Ye Jiaxing presented evidence of being an active-duty soldier and not subject to the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities. Subsequently, the First Special Court submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice to investigate Ye's status with the Ministry of Military Affairs. It was then replied that the commander of the 26th Division had been telegraphed to report the payroll for September of the 22nd year for investigation and reply. On July 12, the First Special Court opened a hearing again to summon Ye Jiaxing, but he still did not appear. It is now reported that the Ministry of Military Affairs has sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice, ordering the Shanghai First Special District Court to prove that Ye Jiaxing is indeed an active-duty military officer and to submit the case files for verification.</p>
<h3>Workers of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Injured Worker Fu Xinzhao Died in the Hospital Yesterday</p>
<p>The Workers' Side Has Filed a Criminal Lawsuit with the Court</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, after the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road resumed work in compliance with the order, it announced the dismissal of 103 male and female workers that evening, causing panic among the workers. Yesterday morning, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center to petition for relief. In addition, Fu Xinzhao, a worker who was injured in the disturbance at the factory, died in the Nanyang Hospital yesterday. The workers' side is preparing to file a lawsuit. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning Petition: After the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory resumed work on the 19th, it announced the dismissal of 103 male and female workers, including Xue Jinhe and Yang Xiaomei, that evening. The workers were panicked and went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center yesterday morning, accompanied by Shi Qingquan, a representative of the Rubber Workers' Union in the Second District, to petition. Xu Yefu, the head of the Third Section, received them. The workers' side made two requests: (1) Order the factory to allow them to resume work; (2) Before the matter is resolved, the factory should provide food expenses for relief. Mr. Xu said that he would accept the requests and promised to convene a mediation meeting on a set date. The workers expressed satisfaction and returned.</p>
<p>Death of Injured Worker: In addition, at 2:00 p.m. on the 4th of this month, a serious dispute occurred due to the obstruction of the union's collection of fees. Many people on both sides were injured. At 5:00 p.m., Fu Xinzhao, a worker in the rubber bottom department, went to the factory to get his clothes and was beaten severely. He was seriously injured at the time and was sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died in the hospital at around 5:00 a.m. yesterday due to his injuries. The hospital notified his family. After hearing the news, the union reported to the local court for an autopsy and hired lawyer Jin Xiongbai to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special Court to emphasize the importance of human life.</p>
<h3>Police Pick Up a Child</h3>
<p>Sun Chungui Comes to the Station to Claim It</p>
<p>Shi Qingru, a watchman at No. 36 Dongmen Road, Nanshi, found a baby boy who was only one month old on the side of the road at 6:00 p.m. the other day. He found that the baby was wearing a cotton-padded jacket made of floral flannel and a skirt. He waited for a long time but no one came to claim it, which made him suspicious. He immediately took the baby back to the station and asked for instructions. Director Liu suspected that the baby was an abandoned illegitimate child or that there was another reason. He was about to send the baby to the church for foster care when Sun Chungui, a Tongzhou native who lived in Pudong Lan Ni Du and worked at the British-American Tobacco Factory, came to the station and claimed that the baby was his son, who was only a month old. He said that his wife, Sun Tao, had come to visit him with the baby, but had hired a car to the ferry terminal at Dadongmen. She had suddenly fainted and dropped the baby on the ground without realizing it. She did not know until she returned home in Pudong and her aunt saw her come back empty-handed and asked about the baby. She could not answer and fell asleep in a daze. Now that she has recovered a little, she has realized what happened and asked to claim the baby. Director Liu checked the statement and found that the baby could not speak and could not prove it. He asked Sun Chungui to provide a reliable shop guarantee and wait for verification before claiming the baby.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Largest Police Station in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Completion Ceremony Will Be Held on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Ten Stories High and Equipped with a Wireless Radio Station</p>
<p>The new Central Police Station of the Public Works Department, the largest in scale in the Far East, has now been completed. It is currently being decorated internally, and a completion ceremony is planned for New Year's Day next year. The authorities will also invite consuls from various countries and leaders from all walks of life to visit. The China Eastern News Agency reporter has made a special visit and recorded the following:</p>
<p>Construction Process: The Central Police Station of the Public Works Department on Fuzhou Road, west of the department, has been built for many years and is no longer suitable for use. The police station is only four stories high, which is not enough for office space. Therefore, the department decided to build a new one across from the department, east of the YMCA and west of the Bank of Communications, through a board resolution last year. Bidding was invited in the summer of last year, and after more than a year, it was completely completed the other day.</p>
<p>Internal Allocation: The new police station building is about 100 feet high, covers an area of three mu, and has a total of ten stories. According to the spokesman of the department, the first floor of the new building is the interrogation section and the vehicle office; the second floor is the office of the Chinese superintendent, the Indian deputy superintendent, and the Chinese deputy superintendent; the third floor is the showroom and the photography room; the fourth floor is the police salary room, the anti-drug room, the investigation section, the private handgun license room, and the chief inspector of Chinese detectives; the fifth floor is the office of the police commissioner, the deputy police commissioner, and the confidential document storage room; the sixth floor is the fingerprint section and the criminal case file room; the seventh floor is the political affairs department and the film censorship section; the eighth and ninth floors are the clubhouse, with a billiard room, a coffee shop, a wine bar, and a library; and the tenth floor is the office of the wireless radio station and the telephone room and the typing room. There are also two wireless radio poles on the roof, which can communicate with the patrol cars at any time, and a part of it is used as a dormitory.</p>
<p>Largest in the Far East: The new building is named the Central Police Station. All of the current Central Police Station will be moved to the new building for office work. After the completion of the new building, it will not only be the leading police agency in Shanghai, but even the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in Japan is not as good. It can be said to be the largest police station in the Far East. The construction cost is one million yuan. The department will wait for the internal decoration to be completely completed and plans to hold a completion ceremony on New Year's Day next year, inviting consuls from various countries and Chinese and Western leaders to visit.</p>
<h3>A Small Steamer Overturns a Rowboat</h3>
<p>The Body of Yang Asan Was Retrieved and Examined</p>
<p>Yang Asan, a native of Zhapu, Zhejiang, was 41 years old. He had been running a bamboo weaving shop in the Hujunying area of Nanshi, specializing in making yellow baskets for loading coal balls in coal ball factories. On the morning of the 16th of this month, at 11:00 a.m., Yang Asan and his son Yang Ada hired a rowboat at the Xuejiabang Wharf to load 1,000 yellow baskets, each priced at six cents, for a total value of sixty yuan, and transported them to the Yuanhe Coal Ball Factory, which had newly opened in the Lan Ni Du Town of Pudong, for delivery. When the rowboat sailed to the outer wharf of the Da Matou, the Xin Ren Chang small steamer, also heading north from the south, was advancing by paddling. Due to careless driving, it slammed into the rowboat. Because the force was too great, the rowboat was immediately overturned, and both people and goods fell into the water. Yang Ada and the boatman were rescued and survived, but Yang Asan's body disappeared and was taken by the god of the sea. At that time, the water patrol team arrested Zhang Xinkang and Xu Cuilin, the drivers who caused the accident, and handed them over to the team for transfer to the local court for interrogation and imprisonment. Yang Asan's body was retrieved by the rescue bureau's patrol boat in the Pu yesterday morning and taken to the Pu beach at the South Wharf. Yang Ada, the son of the deceased, and Yang Tang, the wife of the deceased, went to identify the body and confirmed that it was correct. They then filed a request with the local court for an examination. After receiving the report, the court immediately commissioned Prosecutor Ouyang Shu and other examiners, including Xuan Zhiming, to go to the scene for examination and instructed the family to put the body in a coffin and wait for further investigation.</p>
<h3>A Woman Drowns in the Clear Stream</h3>
<p>She Takes Off Her Qipao and Throws Herself into the Pu River</p>
<p>At about 11:00 p.m. the other night, a woman of about 20 years old suddenly ran alone to the outer embankment of the Jinliyuan No. 7 Wharf on the Bund, took off a lined qipao made of blue woolen fabric with a red plaid lining, and immediately jumped into the Pu River to commit suicide. The nearby boatmen caught a glimpse of her and rushed to rescue her, but it was too late. The woman was submerged in the muddy current in an instant, and her body sank and disappeared. The Chinese police from the Xiaodongmen police station arrived and took the qipao back to the French police station and telegraphed the customs water patrol police station to investigate. The woman took off her long clothes before committing suicide, seemingly hoping to sink more easily after entering the water, which shows her determination to take this last road.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>He Zhang, a young woman from Changzhou, is 31 years old and lives at No. 10 Dacheng Lane, Xizang Road. Her husband, He Fugui, is studying medicine at Dr. Chen Yao's Tang Clinic in Lao Beimen. Recently, she has been feeling economic difficulties and has been contemplating suicide. At around 6:00 p.m. last night, she swallowed raw opium behind people's backs. When people discovered her, they sent her to Baolong Hospital for treatment by car, but it was ineffective, and she died soon after.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand People Compete to See Xiaoling Seek Her Mother</h3>
<p>The Protagonist is Only Six Years Old and an Orphan</p>
<p>"Xiaoling Seeks Her Mother," a play written and directed by Ms. Liu Wang Liming, director of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, was previewed at Shanghai University the other night (the 20th). More than a thousand workers, students, and faculty members and their families watched the play. The windowsills of the auditorium were also full of spectators. At 7:00 p.m., the curtain was raised. Ms. Wu Wenqing, director of the Women and Children's Education Institute attached to the association, reported on the purpose of the meeting and thanked the guests. She then introduced the orphans of the institute who sang and danced, which were quite pleasing to the eye and ear. After the "Flower of Love" dance, "Xiaoling Seeks Her Mother" was performed. The protagonist, "Xiaoling," who is only five or six years old, is also an orphan in the institute. Her voice is loud, and her expression is realistic. She sings and performs alone without any panic. From the first act to the third act, the audience's expressions were all changed by this orphan. At the places of joy, the audience applauded and laughed. At the places of sorrow, the hall was only filled with the sound of sniffing, especially the children. It is said that this play will be performed publicly at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhougong Bridge on North Henan Road on the afternoon of November 10.</p>
<h3>The Detective Office Formally Indicts Lu Xihou and Others</h3>
<p>Disclosing the True Story of the Collapse of the China Xingye Bank</p>
<p>Currently Being Prosecuted for Fraud, Additional Charges May Be Filed</p>
<p>丨 Both Defendants' Requests for Bail Were Rejected 丨</p>
<p>After Qin Baoyuan, the manager of China Xingye Bank, absconded with a large sum of money, the bank immediately collapsed on October 11th, declaring liquidation. All promissory notes that matured were not honored. Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese firm in this city, sold artificial silk worth 6,405 yuan to Dashengchang Grocery Store last month. The store issued a China Xingye Bank promissory note for 7,690 yuan, payable on the first of this month. At the time, Mitsui refunded 16 yuan in cash and 1,654 yuan in local currency notes. However, when the note matured, Xingye Bank was unable to redeem it. Mitsui then filed a complaint with the General Detective Office. After investigation by Chinese detectives Zhang Mingde, Kang Zengxiang, and Liu Xiangzhai, they obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special Court. The chairman of the China Xingye Bank board of directors, Lu Xihou, a local (resident at 51 Longmen Road), and Sun Xiren, the manager of Dashengchang Grocery Store, from Hangzhou (resident at 551 Datong Road), were arrested at 3 PM the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Division One of the First Special Court, where Judge Qian Hongye presided over the hearing. The detective office was represented by lawyer Ru Baoyi, while Lu and Sun were defended by lawyers Wu Linkun, Fan Gang, Zhang Ding, and others. The detective office's lawyer then presented the</p>
<p>Intention to Prosecute and Legal Articles, stating that the prosecution was being brought under Articles 363 and 366 of the Criminal Code for the crimes of fraud and breach of trust. Lu Xihou was also suspected of violating the Banking Law and Savings Law, but due to the complexity of the case, this has not yet been determined, and prosecution will occur later. It was found that in 1932, when China Xingye Bank could not be maintained, Lu Xihou and two others organized the Qunyi Banking Syndicate, investing a total of 225,000 yuan to acquire the bank. However, two of the investors soon withdrew, leaving Lu as the sole proprietor. The bank was neither legally organized nor registered with the Ministry of Finance, so its internal affairs were extremely corrupt. In addition to conducting ordinary banking business, the bank also engaged in savings, offering particularly high interest rates, thus attracting a large amount of deposits from ordinary people. Lu also ran the Huili Ball Court, Xiaoshijie Amusement Park, and Guomin Hotel, and recently organized an international horse racing club, which was</p>
<p>A Disguised Form of Gambling. Because a license could not be obtained, it has been delayed for over three months. The club has purchased 150 horses, each costing 1,000 yuan, requiring 150,000 yuan. Jockeys, etc., were hired from abroad, so daily expenses amounted to 1,000 taels of silver. Therefore, the deposits absorbed by Xingye Bank were transferred for use in the horse racing club. Still fearing insufficiency, the Xinhua Trading Company and Dashengchang Grocery Store, founded by Qin Baoyuan as subsidiaries of Xingye Bank, purchased large quantities of goods from various merchants, paying for them with Xingye Bank promissory notes that could not be cashed. The goods were then sold cheaply the next day to obtain cash to maintain the horse racing club. The defendant, Sun Xiren, helped make this plan successful. It was found that Qin Baoyuan, the manager of Xingye Bank, absconded on the 24th of last month. Lu initially did not announce this. It was not until October 1st, when Mitsui's promissory notes were about to mature, that he reported to the detective office, claiming that the manager had</p>
<p>Embezzled a Huge Sum and Fled. His intention was that this pretense would give him a plausible excuse for not paying the promissory notes and declaring liquidation. Unexpectedly, Mitsui was not fooled. They reported it to the detective office. After investigation by the detective office, the above situation was fully discovered. Furthermore, after the bank collapsed, when the detective office staff maintained order at the bank's entrance, the sight of ordinary poor depositors gathering at the bank gate to hear news was particularly distressing. It was found that the names listed as directors and supervisors of the bank were all fictitious, with only Lu in charge. Therefore, it was requested that the court issue an arrest warrant. However, the circumstances of the case were complex, and a request was made to postpone the hearing. At that time, the detective office may file additional charges, etc. Then, Arjuna, a representative of Mitsui &amp; Co., described the transaction and receipt of the promissory notes. Judge Qian stated that the case was complex and ordered a special hearing to be scheduled for this Friday afternoon. The defendants' lawyers requested bail, but this was rejected.</p>
<h3>Judge Personally Inspects Site of Xue Mai Luo Robbery</h3>
<p>Lasting Two Hours</p>
<p>Inquiries Were Extremely Detailed</p>
<p>Trial Continues Today</p>
<p>Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, Tang Qingyue and other four suspects in the case of the robbery of 12,000 yuan in cash from the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm were arrested and transferred to the Second Special Court for trial and acquitted. Because the French Police Department disagreed with the original verdict, they appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The appeals were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the four appellants Zhang Zuming and others arrived after receiving the summons. At noon, Judge Sun Honglin specially opened the Third Criminal Court to summon Zhang Zuming and others. The defense lawyers Lin Yingqing and Yan Yinwu, and others also arrived in court to await instructions. After the court opened, Zhang and the other three were called and stood before the case. First, Zhang Zuming was questioned, saying: "Why didn't you come to the court last time the court was in session?" Zhang replied that he was suffering from a cough with chills and fever and that his temperature was too high to go out, so he did not attend. After questioning, the judge announced to the four appellants Zhang, Zhuang, Wang, and Tang: "This court will go to the Xue Mai Luo office to investigate at 2 p.m. today, and you must all be there to wait for interrogation." After the announcement, the court adjourned. At 2 p.m., Zhang Zuming and others, accompanied by their defense lawyers, arrived at the Xue Mai Luo office to wait for instructions. Seven employees of the firm, such as Gao Yushu, Feng Ti　, Wan Guirong, etc., and the compradore Zhou Jinggeng also arrived on time to wait for instructions. At the third strike of the bell, Sun Honglin, judge of the Third Branch of the High Court, and Zhao Shibei, chief prosecutor, Huang Lixiang, clerk, and two bailiffs arrived at the scene with Fei Xizhen, the lawyer representing the police department, and Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. First, Zhou Jinggeng was questioned and all the employees present were ordered to step forward and were questioned about the robbery at that time. Then, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, etc. testified to the situation of the robbery at that time, the positions of the robbers, and the process of intimidation and robbery. Sun's questioning was extremely detailed, lasting two and a half hours before it was completed. The victims and the four appellants were then informed that they should come to the court at 2 p.m. tomorrow to continue the trial. After Sun announced this, he returned to the court, and everyone at the scene dispersed.</p>
<h3>Yu Baosan and Son Nearly Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the Car Had a Secret Braking Mechanism</p>
<p>The Bandits Were Unable to Drive the Car and Abandoned the Hostages and Fled</p>
<p>Yu Baosan, a native of Ningbo, 54 years old, lives at No. 176 Weihaiwei Road. He has eight sons. His fourth son, Shuangqing, works at the Tongyuan Bank at No. 50 Tianjin Road. Yu himself runs the Chenxingji Real Estate Department at No. 349 Ningbo Road. Therefore, Mr. Yu and his son always drive their own sedan car to work every morning. The driver is Xu Yuquan, a native of Shaoxing. Yesterday morning at 8:40, Mr. Yu and his son walked out of their home as usual and got into their car. At that time, Wang Guoqing, the doorman of Jinle Lane, from Shandong, saw this and immediately stepped forward to close the car door. The driver, Xu Yuquan, also turned the engine switch, preparing to drive off. Unexpectedly, at that moment, suddenly five or six bandits, one wearing a long robe and the others wearing short clothes, jumped out from the roadside, pushed the doorman into the lane entrance, and two bandits jumped into the car compartment where Mr. Yu and his son were sitting, watching them with guns. Two bandits jumped into the front of the car and dragged the driver out of the car and drove off themselves. The driver and the doorman were shocked and screamed for help. They turned around and saw a Westerner's car parked nearby at the entrance of Xianglin Lane. Fearing that the bandits would escape, the doorman and the driver ran to the Westerner for help. At this time, the bandit driving the car was turning the engine switch, hoping to drive away, but unexpectedly, the car was equipped with a secret braking mechanism, which had already been locked by Mr. Yu and his son, so the bandits were unable to start the car. Seeing that the situation was not good, they abandoned the hostages, got out of the car, and fled in different directions to the east. Wang Guoqing, the doorman, saw this and immediately followed closely behind one of the bandits, hoping to take the opportunity to arrest him. When they reached No. 174 Weihaiwei Road, he saw the bandit throw what he was holding into the house and run away empty-handed. Wang Guoqing saw an opportunity and was about to arrest him when suddenly a bandit jumped out from behind him, pointed a gun at Wang Guoqing, and ordered him to retreat. Wang had no choice but to stand by the side of the road, allowing the bandits to escape. At that time, detectives from the Chengdu Road Detective Office also received a report and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already fled far away and could not be arrested. They went to No. 174 to investigate and found a four-inch pistol discarded by the bandits, containing seven bullets, as well as a blue cloth short shirt and a broken shoe. Looking back at Mr. Yu and his son, their faces were pale and they were still terrified. They were immediately sent back to their residence. The fingerprints in the car were carefully examined and taken back to the detective office for investigation, so as to track down the criminals.</p>
<h3>Perpetrators of Renji Hospital Tragedy Identified as Repeat Offenders in Major Cases</h3>
<p>The Third Branch of the High Court Will Transfer for Trial</p>
<p>After the Renji Hospital tragedy occurred, within three days, the British, French, and Chinese police agencies cooperated to capture several male and female major criminals, and seized guns, Mauser pistols, pellets, and other items in the agency, and transferred them to the Second Branch of the High Court for interrogation and investigation. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper that the Detective Office of the French Police Department, after solving the case, found that six of them were related to the murder of He Jianming from Pudong and the killing of the patrolling police officer on Haige Road on May 3 last year, and the murder of Chen Fangruo and Liu Jie, a couple from Hunan, at No. 64 Shanfu Lane, Shanzhong Road on June 8 this year. They reported this to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and transferred the six people to the Special Second Court for trial. Due to the importance of the case, the public was prohibited from attending the hearing. As a result, the court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction and that the case should be tried by the Third Branch of the High Court. The defendants were handed over to the Police Department to be returned to the Public Security Bureau to await the Third Branch of the High Court to prepare documents to retrieve them. The detective office immediately complied with the order and returned the defendants to the Public Security Bureau. At the same time, it requested the Third Branch of the High Court to prepare documents to transfer them. It is now reported that the Public Security Bureau has returned the defendants in the case to the Second Branch of the High Court. In the future, the Third Court must transfer them from the Second Court.</p>
<h3>Western-Clad Female Corpse Found on the Seashore in Wusong</h3>
<p>Leaving Behind Photos Taken with Foreign Sailors</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a Western-clad female corpse was found on the beach in Wusong. After being spotted by someone, it was reported to the local police station, which ordered the local guarantor Pu Yuxiang to report to the local court to request an autopsy. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu was commissioned, along with coroner Xuan Zhiming, etc., to arrive at the scene. It was determined that the female corpse was about 20 years old, wearing a blue-gray woolen suit, a white shirt, black and white polka dot woolen shorts, a black serge short skirt, pink woolen socks, and white canvas shoes. Ten photos were found nearby (taken with foreign sailors, appearing very intimate), and twenty-four pawn tickets. It was determined that the woman was likely a "salted fish girl" (prostitute), and there was no other reason for her death. It was determined that she committed suicide by drowning, presumably due to frustration in love, resulting in the weak taking this action, ending this remaining life. As there were no family members to claim the body, it was ordered to be coffined and buried by the charitable hall, and the photos were taken back for filing.</p>
<h3>Englishman Killed in Car Accident, Chinese Man Injured and Charged</h3>
<p>Englishman Dies from Reckless Driving</p>
<p>Chinese Man Injured in Car Accident Acquitted</p>
<p>Du Decheng, a native of Yangzhou and the chief cashier of the Wuxi Zhongnan Bank, came to Shanghai for business during the Double Tenth Festival and resided at the Kaitai Hotel on Tianjin Road. At 12:40 PM on the 14th of this month, Du was walking across the road at Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road when Douglas, a British accountant from the British-American Tramway Company, passed by on a motorized bicycle. Because of his skillful driving and excessive speed, he was unable to avoid a collision. As a result, Du Decheng suffered injuries to his head and legs, and the Englishman fell from the bicycle, injuring his brain, and died without receiving medical treatment. When the detective office learned of this, they brought Du Decheng into the detective office for being careless while walking. The next morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court, where it was ordered that Du be released on 500 yuan bail. News of this was reported. It is now reported that Judge Wu Yanqi continued to hear the case in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday morning. The defendant hired lawyer E Sen to defend him, while the detective office determined that Du Decheng was negligent in walking and prosecuted him for causing death by negligence under Article 291 of the Criminal Code. The detective office's lawyer Zhang Tianyin then presented the case, and officer No. 325 testified that the defendant did not pay attention to the passing vehicles when crossing the road, causing the accident. Witness Gu Jiannong testified that he was an employee of the Shanghai Bank branch at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. On the day of the accident, it was Sunday, and he finished work at 12:00. Because a tailor was coming to make a suit, he was chatting with his colleague Qian Tianyou in a room on the third floor. Before long, he suddenly heard a strange sound of a car stopping on the road downstairs. He looked out the window and saw a motorized bicycle overturned to the north, and an Englishman lying down. A Chinese man was lying on the ground to the south. I did not see the collision, but according to my guess, the motorcycle must have been going too fast and had passed the car in front of it, causing it to brake suddenly and make a strange sound. The person also fell from the bicycle, etc. Qian Tianyou also testified that he was looking out of the window on the third floor of the Shanghai Bank when he suddenly saw the defendant walking to the middle of the road. The deceased suddenly crashed into him from the right at great speed. There is no doubt that the deceased was driving too fast. Du Decheng was questioned and stated that there were no vehicles when he crossed the road. When he reached the middle of the road, the deceased's car suddenly crashed into him, injuring his head and legs, and he has not yet recovered and has difficulty walking. Lawyer E Sen then argued that the deceased had only been in Shanghai from England for three months and had no driving experience. Moreover, on that day, he was driving too fast, which caused the brakes to be affected. The person fell from the bicycle and landed on the ground, six feet away from the car, which shows that his speed was too high and it was not easy to stop suddenly. However, it was found that the accident site was at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road, where vehicles were constantly passing by. The deceased should not have been traveling at such a high speed, which caused the accident. Therefore, the deceased was at fault, and the defendant was not involved. Moreover, the defendant is now seriously injured and should be acquitted. Judge Wu reviewed the testimony and acquitted Du Decheng in court.</p>
<h3>Gang Robbers in Penglai Market Case and Others Sentenced One by One</h3>
<p>Sentenced Yesterday</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents Hold Meeting to Study Measures for Road Construction Beyond Concessions</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News yesterday, formal negotiations regarding road construction beyond concessions and the establishment of special zones will proceed once Mr. Fessenden, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, returns to Shanghai.

<h3>Declaration of the Shanghai Women's Progressive Association</h3>
<p>The modern era has encountered a major transformation of social values in various aspects. In the process of building a new culture caused by the inevitable conclusion of modern civilization, the liberation of women, who have been neglected for thousands of years but occupy a very important position in human evolution, has become one of the important tasks of the present day. Regarding this point, only those who calmly observe the trends of the times and the path of modern civilization will not overlook this fact. Originally, the so-called women's movement carries two meanings. On the passive side, it is the general awareness of women who seek to break away from the problem of male dependence and subordination. On the active side, in addition to the liberation of women themselves, it is a fundamental issue related to the progress of the entire nation. In other words, the task of the women's movement must include not only seeking the liberation and improvement of women's own status and the cultivation of virtues, but also engaging in social production and promoting its ability to the nation-state. Therefore, this issue is not only a problem for women themselves, but also a link in the evolutionary development process of the country and nation. Historical records indicate that the nineteenth century was truly an era in which the destruction of the old lives of women, who had been groaning in cruel bondage for thousands of years, and the creation of a new, vibrant life for women were advancing side by side. At that time, because all countries were in the process of this destruction and construction, the women's movement throughout the world made great progress. Therefore, although our country, which received the opportunity to accept this new trend of thought later due to various objective environments, has had several decades of history in the women's movement, we, though not completely blindly negating the achievements made, can at least only critically accept its results at this moment. Especially in the work of the past few years, generally speaking, only the slogan of women's participation in politics has been shouted out, and some passive relief work has been done, while neglecting its main aspect. It is an undeniable and well-known fact that it has not helped women's future and social welfare. However, on the other hand, there are currently some people in society attempting to revive this erroneous path, which further shows that women themselves have reached an even more dangerous stage today. This danger, under the protection of a clever trick, transfers the fate of women's future from the old bondage to a new bondage. This should be that the development stage of the women's movement itself has encountered a very serious crisis again. Here, we should rise up to break through this historical repetition. However, we are unwilling to sing high-sounding tunes that are too far from reality, so we will not reveal any great and eternal plans here. We only want to do some practical things in this movement, that is, we only want to provide all our intelligence to improve and obtain the general status and equal opportunities for women in society, and indirectly serve the country, nation, and society. Needless to say, in the evolution and development of all living things, sexual differentiation and sexual opposition occupy a very important position. However, there is definitely no meaning of domination, subordination, and determining superiority and inferiority in this. This has already been the conclusion obtained by various parties in the modern era. Therefore, we must enable all our women to obtain complete freedom and complete independence in all aspects. However, in order to achieve the complete realization of this task, the economic subordination of women to men must be eliminated, and the shackles imposed on women by the general society must be broken. This point should always be placed at the forefront of the women's movement agenda. Because until today, women in general have not been able to remove all their own special living conditions, and these conditions are still concentrated in their special status. Therefore, the program to be performed in our future movement is to focus on how to enable women in general to eliminate their economic subordination to men, that is, special living conditions, and how to break the heavy shackles imposed on women by society, that is, inhuman living conditions. In other words, to provide women in general with the necessary weapons, that is, intelligence, to eliminate this economic subordination to men and the heavy shackles bestowed by society, so as to cultivate completely free and independent people, so as to prepare to be social warriors, and to accomplish their social service as new virtuous wives and good mothers. In addition, we also deeply realize that the women's movement will not succeed in a society under the feudal system, and at the same time, the women's movement will not be allowed to succeed in a society under the capitalist system. Therefore, we have come to this understanding that only under the social system of the Three Principles of the People can the women's movement develop to a higher stage and complete its entire task. We hold this enthusiastic wish, which is not very, and with the spirit of sacrifice and service, we engage in the practice of focusing on the big picture and starting with the small things, and with a very sincere attitude, we hope that all women in society will participate, work hard, and be active. At the same time, we stand on the perspective of the entire nation and eagerly hope that gentlemen with a group consciousness will give us assistance, guidance, and criticism. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Single-Direction Traffic Plan Moved to Jiujiang Road, Taxpayers Association Asks for Cancellation of Proposal</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary of the Public Works Department, stating: "Sir, we have received a letter from the Eighteenth District Branch of the Shanghai Special District No. 1 Citizens' Federation, which states: 'Having read in the newspapers that various businesses on Hankou Road have requested the cancellation of the one-way traffic plan on that road, the Public Works Department has transferred the request to the Traffic Committee for consideration and submission to the Board of Directors for approval. After discussion, the committee concluded that the one-way traffic on Hankou Road is more beneficial than harmful and decided to temporarily shelve the protests of the businesses on that road, pending reports from the police and public works departments on whether one-way traffic can be implemented on Jiujiang Road. We understand that the businesses on Hankou Road want to cancel the one-way traffic because it affects their business. Now, the Public Works Department intends to implement the one-way traffic that Hankou Road merchants do not want on Jiujiang Road. Moreover, Jiujiang Road is narrower than Hankou Road, and there are more shops, many of which are small businesses. If one-way traffic is implemented, the business of the shops on Jiujiang Road will be unimaginable. Our federation cannot remain silent on this harmful and useless road policy of the Public Works Department. We are writing to request that you forward this letter to the Public Works Department, asking them to cancel the one-way traffic plan on Jiujiang Road to ease the difficulties of the businesses. We would be most grateful.'" The letter was received by the association and we are accordingly writing to request that your bureau comply with public opinion and cancel the proposal, in order to maintain the business of the shops on that road. This is addressed to the Secretary of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Defend Dr. Zhong Juemin Against False Accusations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians Association sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau on behalf of Dr. Zhong Juemin, who has been falsely accused, requesting a public clarification. The letter stated: "Sir, we have received a letter from Mr. Zhong Zhimin, the brother of our member Zhong Juemin, which states: 'My brother Juemin has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for seventeen years, has been law-abiding, and has never engaged in improper behavior. However, a man named Zhong Minggeng was arrested by your bureau's detective team on Fangbang Road in Ximen for selling red pills. He falsely claimed that Juemin was his relative and that the red pills were bought by Juemin's servant. On August 25th, officers from your bureau's detective team escorted Zhong Minggeng to the Xinzha police station in the Public Concession to request an investigation. The Xinzha police station summoned Juemin and his cook Zhao Donglin for questioning. Fortunately, it was found that Zhong Minggeng did not know Zhong Juemin or Zhao Donglin at all, and his statements were completely false. It was also discovered that Juemin was a legitimate doctor of many years. They were told to go home and resume their business. However, on the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Special District No. 1 District Court issued an arrest warrant, and Juemin and Zhao Donglin were arrested and detained. We are writing this letter to request assistance.'" After investigation, Dr. Zhong Juemin is indeed a member of our association, and his scholarship and ethics are well known to our colleagues. It seems unjust that he is being unfairly suppressed based solely on Zhong Minggeng's one-sided false accusations, which are completely unsubstantiated. This makes law-abiding residents feel endangered and fearful. After discussion at the Sixth Regular Meeting of our Eighth Executive Committee, we decided to send a letter to your bureau requesting a clarification. We are accordingly writing to request that you investigate and handle this matter. We would be most grateful. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, from the Shanghai Physicians Association."</p>
<p>Also, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Compatriots Association sent a letter to the Police Bureau, stating: "Sir, our fellow townsman Zhong Juemin has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for seventeen years, with excellent skills and social recognition. However, a man named Zhong Minggeng was arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Detective Team for selling red pills. He falsely claimed that Zhong Juemin was a relative and that the red pills were bought from Zhong Juemin's servant. On August 25th, officers from the Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team escorted Zhong Minggeng to the Xinzha police station in the Public Concession to request an investigation. After questioning by the police station, it was determined that Zhong Minggeng did not know Zhong Juemin or his cook Zhao Donglin at all, and his statements were false. They were told to go home and resume their business. However, on the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau requested the Shanghai Special District No. 1 District Court to issue an arrest warrant. Together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Xinzha police station, they went to Zhong Juemin's clinic and arrested Zhong Juemin and Zhao Donglin. On the morning of the 17th, they were sent to the No. 1 Special District Court for trial. The police station stated that there was no conclusive evidence against Zhong Juemin and Zhao Donglin and that they had not committed any crimes. They requested a detailed investigation and a postponement of the interrogation. Although the court approved a seven-day postponement and ordered the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to bring Zhong Minggeng for questioning next time, Zhong Juemin and Zhao Donglin are already being detained at the police station. Zhong Juemin is a law-abiding doctor. This time, he was falsely accused and detained by Zhong Minggeng, whom he does not know, along with his cook Zhao Donglin. This is extremely unjust. In addition to sending a separate letter to the No. 1 Special District Court, we respectfully request that you strictly investigate Zhong Minggeng, who is being detained in your department, in order to deter unlawful acts and reassure law-abiding citizens. We would be most grateful. This is addressed to Wu, the Songhu Garrison Commander, from Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Pei Yunqing, the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Compatriots Association."</p>

<h3>New Medicine Association Defends Starlight Pharmaceutical Factory Against False Accusations</h3>
<p>The New Medicine Association submitted a report to the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are submitting this report because a member has been falsely accused and we request that the relevant parties be released on bail during the chemical testing period. According to a letter from our affiliated member, Wanguo Pharmacy, the products manufactured by its affiliated Starlight Pharmaceutical Factory have been tested by pharmacists and found to be free of prohibited drugs. On the morning of the 21st of this month, the Second Branch of the Police Bureau suddenly seized compound calomel pills, arsenous acid pills, red tonic pills, appetite-stimulating sugar, compound laxative pills, and other drugs, and detained ten employees. We request that you forward a letter to the bureau requesting their release." We immediately sent a letter and asked Sun Choucheng, the person in charge of the association, to visit Director Li of the branch bureau to explain everything. Director Li said that the case was reported by Ma Wujiu, Sang Jinhai, and Long Bingyan, who claimed that the factory was privately manufacturing red pills, so they immediately went to search the factory. However, since there were no raw materials for manufacturing red pills, they only took various drugs to the bureau for testing. They have already interrogated the reporters and four key personnel from the factory, including Wen Yutang, and sent them to the main bureau. The remaining six people can be released on bail, and Da Kang Pharmacy has already posted bail for them. The drugs manufactured by the pharmaceutical factory are all produced and managed under the supervision of licensed pharmacists. The drugs seized this time cannot be substituted for red pills and can be sent to the Health Bureau for testing. However, during the testing period, we request that your bureau handle this matter in accordance with Article 2 of the improved drug inspection measures jointly formulated with the Health Bureau in the past, and temporarily release the suspects on appropriate bail to avoid harming innocent people. If the testing results confirm that the drugs can be substituted for red pills, the guarantor will be responsible for handing over the guaranteed parties. Otherwise, the three reporters should be prosecuted for false accusations."</p>
<h3>U.S. Consular Court Investigates Sailor Assault Case</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the SS President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Lines, recently departed from the United States bound for Manila, when it stopped in Yokohama on October 12th. Two sailors on board were assaulted by eight sailors from the engine room, sustaining serious injuries. The captain of the ship sent a wireless telegraph to Shanghai during the voyage. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, an officer from the U.S. Consular Court, assisted by the water police, boarded the ship and arrested the eight sailors. The cases of two of the sailors were more serious, and they were released on bail of US$1,000 each. The remaining six sailors were each released on bail of $100. The case was heard by U.S. Consular Judge Hillermeier this morning (22nd) at 10:00 AM. The plaintiff was first questioned about the circumstances of the assault. After the questioning, the defendant's lawyer, Davis, argued that according to the plaintiff's testimony, the ship was docked at the Yokohama wharf when the assault occurred. Therefore, the U.S. Consular Court in China had no jurisdiction over the case and it should be tried by the Yokohama Japanese court. After the statement, the U.S. Consular Judge stated that there was a significant question as to whether the court should accept the case. District Attorney Huaxiannai requested an adjournment until 2:00 PM to continue the hearing so that he could thoroughly study this point. The U.S. Consular Judge agreed and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Spanish-Style Housing Design Republished: Mr. Fan Wenzhao, a famous architect in Shanghai, recognizing that housing is of great importance to people's livelihood, has drawn and published Spanish-style housing designs that are most suitable for the climate of our country, economical, simple, and scientific. For a time, people from far and near heard the news and rushed to buy them. It is now heard that Mr. Fan is receiving many orders from people who want to buy the designs because the designs are so popular with the public. Therefore, he has reprinted a batch and is selling them for half the price, $1 per copy, through major bookstores in Shanghai to meet the needs of all sectors of society.</p>

<h3>Ziyuehua Discusses Impressions of Traveling in Europe</h3>
<p>The World War is Undeniable</p>
<p>Foreigners Praise Credit Investigation Work</p>
<p>Mr. Ziyuehua, Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, was sent abroad last autumn by the bank to investigate banking businesses in various countries. Colleagues at the China Credit Association, because Mr. Zi is one of the directors of the association and the standing director of the China Credit Bureau established by the association, entrusted him to investigate the status of credit bureaus in various countries to learn from them. Mr. Zi returned to China last month, and colleagues from the association specially welcomed him at the Bank Club the other day and invited Mr. Zi to report on his investigation. The reporter from the Shen Shi News has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Each Country Has Three Abundances According to Mr. Zi, this trip was extremely thought-provoking. Seeing the increasing decline of overseas Chinese, the incompetence of diplomats, and the contempt for people of color, everything is enough to make people weep. Some government officials and celebrities often go abroad under the guise of inspection, but in fact, they do nothing and waste national funds. In this year's Chicago World's Fair, each pavilion was splendid and magnificent, extremely attentive to display, but the Chinese pavilion was simple and crude, like a small stall in the market. Beside it were the Japanese and Manchurian pavilions, and comparing the two, one felt ashamed. After the war, the industry and commerce of various countries have made rapid progress, and all measures are based on rationalization as the standard. Entering such an environment, one can only sigh with admiration. However, the social structure of each advanced industrial and commercial country has its own contradictions. Nowadays, democratic countries all have three abundances: many beggars, many prostitutes, and many airplanes and cannons. The inevitability of a second world war is undeniable, but once the war breaks out, the transformation of the economic system will be difficult to describe.</p>
<p>The American Banking System Mr. Zi continued, although the American banking industry is very developed, its system is not good. The laws of each state are different. Except for major policies such as military affairs and diplomacy, which are controlled by the federal government, other things are handled separately. There are more than fifty kinds of banking laws promulgated throughout the country. With so many differences, the malpractices are naturally great. Moreover, the American population is complex, and their ancestors were immigrants from various countries, so their thinking is also very inconsistent, which has a great impact on the laws and regulations. On the contrary, the British system is relatively sound. Since there has been a bank, it has had a history of 150 years, experienced many twists and turns, and gradually improved to this day. American banks mostly arose after the European war with the expansion of industry and commerce. The organization is not precise, and once a panic occurs, a crisis arises. Our country's banking system has not yet been established. What to do in the future should be carefully selected.</p>
<p>British and American Credit Investigation Business Yu (Mr. Zi refers to himself) was entrusted by you when he went abroad to investigate the credit investigation business in various countries. Although my talent is limited, I dare not neglect my work. I am a director of the the Credit Association. Whenever there is an opportunity, I will visit. The credit investigation offices in their country are also jointly organized by various entrepreneurs, which is similar to the establishment of a credit investigation office in China by our association. Representatives of various entrepreneurs often gather at a certain time and place to exchange news and study safe methods of lending. The American credit investigation offices are the most developed in the world: (1) Because the American banking system is imperfect and uncoordinated, although each bank has a special department for investigation, it still has to seek help from the credit investigation office. (2) The credit investigation office has a good organization and handles affairs quickly. Because its service scope covers all walks of life, it not only helps banks but also benefits other industrial and commercial circles. The scope of individual cases is large, and there are more than 1,000 office workers. The organization and scope of the British credit investigation office are inferior to those of the United States. The buildings are generally not very clean, and the business is not eager to make progress. This is due to the traditional conservative habits of the British.</p>
<p>China's Credit Investigation Business I once visited the India Eastern Credit Bureau (Indian Eastern Association) in the United Kingdom (Note: This is the British special agent of the China Credit Bureau, and the China Credit Bureau is also the agent of the credit bureau in China.) I was shown a report sent by the China Credit Bureau by the manager of the bureau. He said that the China Credit Bureau, which was only established for two years, was able to make such a detailed report, which was very strange. However, some reports have too much material, which makes it difficult for readers to understand at a glance, so it is best to make a brief introduction at the beginning of the article. This is especially good. This can be used as a model for this office.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Credit Investigation Office On the third day after I returned to China, I came to this office. After being away for a year, the archive materials have increased a lot. Various systems have been improved, and the business is expanding day by day. The office staff are busy with work, and no one is idle. The atmosphere of vitality is revealed everywhere, and I feel inexplicably happy. However, all of this is due to the efforts of the directors and representatives. Although I have the name of a director, I am ashamed of not having contributed and feel deeply guilty.</p>

<h3>European Satirists</h3>
<p>— Wei Ming</p>
<p>Great satirists are mostly "full of untimely things." If you add a little persecution or experience of wandering, then his satire will be particularly sharp and insightful, even if the times are different, it is still thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" is still a favorite of children and "big children" to this day. I am afraid that it is not only because of the beauty of the words and the lightness of the imagination, nor is it simply because it satirizes the England of the time, but rather because it is "the long journey of the human soul," like Goethe's "Faust" and Cervantes' "Don Quixote." And Swift's life "like a poisoned rat angrily dying in a hole" (to use his own words) was a prerequisite for him to be able to sharply depict "the long journey of the human soul."</p>
<p>If Cervantes had not been kidnapped by pirates and enslaved for five years, if the wife he married at the age of thirty-seven had been rich, if he had not been forced to go to jail every day after his marriage due to debt (part of his "Don Quixote" was probably written in prison), then, whether "Don Quixote" could have far surpassed the scripts he wrote in his early years may be a question? Now we all know "Don Quixote," but we don't talk much about the scripts he wrote in his early years.</p>
<p>Dante, who wrote "The Divine Comedy," although he was also an exile, his whole life was much more comfortable than Swift and Cervantes; comfort is also bland. Comfort also made Dante have no other broad world view or outlook on life except to put his political enemies in hell. And how narrow his religious views are!</p>
<p>I like "Faust" more than "The Divine Comedy," but I think that "Faust" and "The Divine Comedy" combined are not as good as "Gulliver's Travels" or "Don Quixote"!</p>
<p>I don't think much of satirists who live comfortably and especially get along well with the society of the time. Such a satirist, following the tastes of the "citizens" of his time, added satire to the "rebellious thinkers," which probably won a lot of applause at the time, but when we read his works now, we only feel bad and feel that he is a clown, and his satire has become his own ugly mask.</p>
<p>One such satirist is Aristophanes, a comedian of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>He was conservative, and he wrote the comedies "The Clouds" and "The Frogs" to mock Socrates and Euripides. He worked hard to mock this philosopher and tragedian because they mercilessly exposed the corruption and ignorance of Athenian society. They attacked traditional ideas.</p>
<p>Aristophanes could not have a broad world view; he was worried about the "civil war" between Athens and Sparta, but the "method of ending the war" he proposed in the comedy "Lysistrata" seems like a clown's joke to us now.</p>
<p>What is his cheap method? It is that the women of Athens and Sparta organized a "sex strike alliance" to subdue the war-loving men. He taught them to: first use their appearance to seduce those men, and when they are impatient, put forward conditions: peace and truce. His method was certainly effective on the "stage."</p>
<p>I remember some time ago, the newspaper said that some pacifist women in Europe and the United States advocated organizing a group to stand in the middle of the battle lines of the warring armies if a world war broke out. Haha, I didn't expect Aristophanes to still have comrades! However, such a "joke" is to divert the world's attention from the truly effective methods of eliminating imperialist war!</p>
<h3>Superficial</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>People who don't usually talk about women suddenly hear that he is in love, which arouses a temporary uproar among acquaintances. This is a kind of curiosity and is not surprising. For example, in recent months, I have occasionally moved my pen, and I was actually honored to be mentioned by a certain professor at a certain banquet in Peiping. According to a friend who wrote to me, the professor said that he was very dissatisfied with what I wrote in certain publications, because "a person who reads as much as he does should not write such superficial things. Why doesn't he write something more formal?"</p>
<p>When I received the professor's words, I naturally felt very honored, and at the same time, my jacket was soaked with sweat. I remembered that ten years ago, when the professor was as superficial as this superficial thing, cooking beef in an apartment in Peiping, who would have thought that in just ten years, the distance between us would be so great! The professor is now an authority in the cultural world. Although I have never had the honor to read his "profound" works, I am now living on the sea, relying on writing superficial things to support a lonely little life. Naturally, I am ashamed to death.</p>
<p>I don't feel offended or ashamed when the word "superficial" is used to criticize what I write. Because my original intention in writing was not to be "profound." Although I also flip through books after eating, I have never been abroad or studied with famous teachers. I don't have anything in my stomach, so naturally I can't spout high theories. I'm not ashamed of this. Secondly, the publications that accept my articles are not annual publications of any university, but things for so-called superficial people to read. The editors repeatedly urged me to write in a popular way, otherwise it would affect their sales and everyone would have nothing to eat. Therefore, when I write articles, I always deliberately seek to be superficial and clear in terms of both the form and content of the text, and I don't advocate elegance. I never thought that this kind of publication and my kind of article would be read by high-level people like professors. Therefore, the word superficial is not an insult to me. If it is too elegant, there is a worry about breaking my own and other people's rice bowls.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the explanation of the word superficial. I don't know which aspect of my articles the professor's criticism refers to. My "scientific essays," some short articles about reading, I don't admit that their content is childish, ridiculous, or superficial. They do not violate scientific truths, nor have they ever had common sense errors. I adhere to the attitude that a scientist should have. As for the way of expression, I only feel that it is too unpopular, too superficial, and too foreign-style. As for saying that if you have knowledge, you should speak in a way that no one understands. Even if this is true, I have no reason to accept it before I become a university professor.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to state that Shi has not been "reading so much" since leaving Peiping. This is because I am busy with food and clothing, which makes me lazier day by day. But at the same time, I am also looking down on books day by day. I think that if I also sit in some academic institution one day, specializing in selling books, and never see ordinary people other than Western suits all year round, it would be better to hang out in the streets while secretly reading a few broken newspapers under the shade of trees, and borrow one or two books from the circulating library to read, and say a few superficial words. Isn't that more interesting than sitting on the podium and giving a monologue that no one understands?</p>
<h3>"Mao Savage"</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Farewell (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rapid moan was emitted from the deity hall, like the kind of urgent, wailing sound that happens when the silk factory's whistle is about to end, which made the aunt have to leave her beloved baby and go back to the deity hall.</p>
<p>"Gaolao Yao, what do you feel?" The voice started very high, but later gradually became hoarse, "Let's just let it go! You suffering thing." She had already walked to the bedside, and the lamplight was stopped on the uncle's face, which had completely turned dirt yellow.</p>
<p>"Alas, you've buried your life in endurance! Submission is your best way to resolve things. You are even weaker than a little rabbit," she kept shaking her head. "You say that I scold you, I completely disregard you, but I am not a pig or a snot worm, so how can I keep silent and let you be coaxed and bullied by others? But, in fact, you have suffered enough and been completely fooled by others. Where have you ever accepted my advice and encouragement? You are just naked, kneeling before power and tyranny! Gaolao Yao, to this day, I feel that you have not done a single right thing in your life. Just the fact that you were deprived of your own well-cultivated twenty mu of mulberry land is enough to make me hate you to the bone. Think about it, is it a happy thing for a girl who is not yet fifteen years old to marry a husband who is thirty years old and half her height? I won't mention this either. I can only complain about my parents and my horoscope. Which daughter would have such good fortune to choose her husband herself? 丨丨" She crossed one of her legs and placed it on the bed, as if preparing to settle an old debt with her deaf and dumb uncle for a longer time.</p>
<p>"In the past, the mulberry trees that the two of us worked so hard to plant, the silkworms that we raised, and the silk that I worked day and night to make, you lightly, were frightened by the silk merchants and cocoon customers, and you quickly got rid of them; for example, we used our own painstaking efforts to exchange for two cents, but they could exchange for four cents without any effort. You say that small capital eats small, and large capital eats large, and without doing this, you won't even be able to sell a penny—alas, when people chase you, you hide and avoid, can't you bite back?</p>
<p>"Gaolao Yao, can you tell me? Why do you seem so afraid and timid in front of Yao Nan? It is clear that he set a trap to frame you, causing you to suffer a wrongful lawsuit, and secretly gave you forty yuan, and that twenty mu of land has been in his hands for thirty years. I know that you are not greedy for those forty yuan, but why don't you use reason to beat your enemy to death? Do you completely believe that there is no justice in the world anymore?</p>
<p>"In the past thirty years, the world has completely changed. Now, even children know that the Western devils can make silk themselves, and there is so much that they can't use it all, and no one wants ours anymore. Now who is happy to get back a piece of wasteland? It's your own fault that a seventy-year-old is still rolling around in the fields. Since you are willing to suffer dozens of losses, why are you unwilling to admit this one mistake to me? …" She propped her cheek with her hand, staring at the dying patient as if forcing a prisoner to confess.</p>
<p>"Gaolao Yao, I know that you are most afraid of two things in your life, scolding and threats can take your life. A Yao, take advantage of the time when you still have a breath, admit your mistakes, I can still have time to forgive you, so that we can have a better time when we meet underground in the future. Nod your head, … you fool, did you hear my words?" The two of them looked at each other, silent, and what was left was still the painful moaning and the whispers of the silkworms next door.</p>
<p>Later, she turned her face to me and said, "He doesn't understand anything now. In fact, I don't feel anything if he dies, but he asked me several times and I didn't properly burn a bowl of pork porridge and sugar tea for him to eat, and he won't be able to close his eyes when he dies …"</p>
<p>She was silent for a while and then stood up, opened the uncle's bedding, and ordered me, "Go to the rosewood box and take out the shroud. He left a trace of breath waiting for those things. I'll help him change his clothes, so that the rusty machine can walk more comfortably."</p>
<p>The aunt carefully helped the uncle put on his clothes, gently picked him up, so that his soles were placed flat outwards, and comforted him in a kind and comforting tone like coaxing a child:</p>
<p>"Shao Yao, go well on your way, and you don't need to worry about anything. As for me, alas, needless to say, I will definitely live my life as usual. I will also scold people, until my throat is useless, … old ghost!"</p>
<p>While I was sobbing on my aunt's lap, I seemed to hear a small sound like a chicken burping. So I cried out loudly and happily. After a long time, my aunt said to me gently and softly in a businesslike tone:</p>
<p>"Okay, it's almost dawn. Now you run back and tell Brother Ren and Fourth Uncle, and I'll call the undertaker."</p>
<p>I walked out of the door, and the cold wind wrapped around my head. I suddenly felt a few drops of water dripping from my hairline into my neck.</p>
<h3>Little West Boy (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Langston Hughes, Translated by Fo Lang</p>
<p>Things are really busy tonight. Some people want to shine their shoes at the same time. They sit on the armrests of the chairs in the reception room. Cindy takes his black shoe box for them to put one foot on while shining. A tall farmer gave him half a dime and gently patted him on the head.</p>
<p>"Really a smart kid," he said to the tea room head.</p>
<p>At about ten o'clock, Miss Maria McCarron's room rang, but Charlie had other things to do. Jew Willis called Cindy to go up and see what she wanted. Miss McCarron had just run in from the snow and with a bulky and ugly man. They were both drunk. Cindy knocked lightly on her door.</p>
<p>"Come in," the man roared.</p>
<p>Cindy opened the door and saw Miss McCarron standing naked in the middle of the floor combing her hair. He stopped at the threshold.</p>
<p>"Hey, come in," the man said. "She won't bite you! Where is that tea room boy? We want some liquor! … Go down and tell Charlie to come up here! He knows what I need!"</p>
<p>Cindy walked away trembling. When he found Charlie, he told him about Miss McCarron. The child was very horrified, because he often heard children of color fascinated to look at white women 丨丨 But this little tea room boy just laughed.</p>
<p>"You're really a dumb little ghost!" he said. "But you've only been here for a while, and you'll see more than that in the future!" He winked and gently touched Cindy with his elbow. "Kid, I've sold ten bottles of liquor tonight!" he whispered happily. "Some are my own!"</p>
<p>Cindy went back to the reception room to shine shoes. A big red-necked guest smoking and a group of merchants drinking in a corner of the room beckoned to him. "Hey, kid! Come here and shine my shoes!" So he took his shoe box from the side and walked to the middle of this group of people, bent his knees in front of this big man, took out his shoe polish can and rag, and went to work.</p>
<p>This white man told embarrassing stories, more obscene than what Cindy had heard in the black barbershop, and not very interesting 丨 some simply made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The big man who was having his shoes shined said: "Now I want to talk about one." He said in a southern drawl and a soft blurred tone like some old black people's endings. "This is about a black carbon head going to see Aunt Henny …"</p>
<p>A burst of rude laughter welcomed his beginning of the narration. He was encouraged to talk about others.</p>
<p>"The old black ghost pressed a girl on the bank …" he began to say.</p>
<p>Cindy shined his shoes, put the cloth in the wooden box, stood up and waited for his reward, but the speaker did not pay attention to this black child. Until he finished his story and everyone else laughed heartily, then he looked at Cindy and suddenly grinned.</p>

<p>The elementary school education correspondence class attached to the Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou Normal School has been held for three sessions since its establishment, and the results are remarkable.

It is reported that as of yesterday, in addition to the original students, more than 700 new members have joined.

It is said that there are a total of nine kinds of lecture notes in this semester, which have been scheduled by the school's extension education office to be distributed in batches on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Elementary Education Facilities (1) by Zhou Fo Hai</h3>
<p>Zhou Fo Hai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, reported the following at the Provincial Government Memorial Weekly on the 22nd:</p>
<p>Today, I will briefly report on the past facilities and future plans for elementary education in our province.</p>
<p>First, I will explain the development of elementary education in Jiangsu Province over the past three years in terms of numbers. Due to the overall economic decline and financial difficulties, there has not been a significant increase in education funding. Consequently, there has not been substantial development in the quantity of educational undertakings. However, a comparison between the statistics for the 21st year and the 19th year shows some increase in elementary education. In terms of the number of classes, there were 158 provincial school classes in the 19th year and 208 in the 21st year, an increase of 50 classes. The number of county school classes was 11,596 in the 19th year and 14,763 in the 21st year, an increase of 3,167 classes. The number of private school classes was 1,102 in the 19th year and 1,424 in the 21st year, an increase of 322 classes. If we add up the total number of classes in provincial, county, and private schools, the total number of classes in the 19th year was 12,856 and in the 21st year it was 16,395, an overall increase of 3,539 classes. In terms of the number of students, there were 6,537 provincial school students in the 19th year and 8,909 in the 21st year, an increase of 2,372 students, representing an increase of over 36 percent. The number of county school students was 636,711 in the 19th year and 672,563 in the 21st year, an increase of 35,852 students, representing an increase of over 5 percent. The number of private school students was 48,717 in the 19th year and 62,932 in the 21st year, an increase of 14,215 students, representing an increase of over 29 percent. If we add up the total number of students in provincial, county, and private schools, the total number of students in the 19th year was 691,965 and in the 21st year it was 744,404, an overall increase of 52,439 students. The total increase in the number of people compared between these two years, calculated as a percentage, is actually over 7 percent. In terms of funding, the provincial elementary school funding was 289,223 yuan in the 19th year and 337,997 yuan in the 21st year, an increase of 48,774 yuan, representing an increase of over 16 percent. The county elementary school funding was 5,369,379 yuan in the 19th year and 5,511,743 yuan in the 21st year, an increase of 142,364 yuan, representing an increase of over 2 percent. The private elementary school funding was 524,251 yuan in the 19th year and 710,539 yuan in the 21st year, an increase of 186,288 yuan, representing an increase of over 35 percent. If we add up the total funding for provincial, county, and private schools, the total elementary school funding in the 19th year was 6,182,853 yuan and in the 21st year it was 6,560,279 yuan, an overall increase of 377,426 yuan. The total increase in silver dollars compared between these two years, calculated as a percentage, is actually over 6 percent. Looking at all the above increase rates, the increase in students is greatest in provincial schools, followed by private schools. The increase in funding is greatest in private schools, followed by provincial schools. From this, it can be seen that Jiangsu's elementary school education, when compared in terms of numbers, is continuing to progress, but the rate of progress is very slow. If it continues like this, who knows how many years it will take to achieve universal compulsory education? However, the people's burden cannot be increased further, and there is no source of revenue for local education funds. It is difficult to make something out of nothing, even for a skilled housewife.</p>
<p>Now, let's divide the larger projects that have been done in the past and those that are planned for the future into provincial and county-level undertakings, and report them layer by layer.</p>
<p>(1) Past Facilities</p>
<p>(A) Provincially Managed</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of Compulsory Education Experimental Zones. The popularization of compulsory education is important, but how can it be popularized? Many methods have been proposed from various aspects, such as simplified elementary schools, short-term elementary schools, and two-part systems. However, it is difficult to determine which method is the simplest, easiest to implement, and most effective, and it needs to be experimented with. For this reason, in the 22nd year, we established five provincial compulsory education experimental zones. Their task is to comprehensively include all methods of popularizing compulsory education, experiment with them, and observe the results. The locations of the five compulsory education zones are Zhenjiang, Huaiyin, Donghai, Huangdu, and Qixia Mountain. They are all entrusted to the principals of provincial normal schools or rural normal schools for management. The reason for choosing these five locations is that first, Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province, but there are very few elementary schools and many school-age children are out of school, so it is necessary to seek relief first, and it can also be established as a model for the entire province. Huaiyin and Donghai are located in northern Jiangsu and are relatively underdeveloped in education. The province should use its strength to subsidize the development of their elementary education. Huangdu and Qixia Mountain are because the results of the rural normal schools in these two places are very good, and the two principals are also very willing to work hard, so they are specially asked to take on this major task in the hope of making new contributions for everyone's reference. As for the teachers in the schools in each compulsory education zone, most of them are using normal school students in the highest grades. On the one hand, it can save public funds, and on the other hand, it can increase the practical experience of normal school students. According to current statistics, there are a total of 49 elementary schools of various natures established in the five compulsory education zones, with 83 classes. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education Association Second Representative Congress</h3>
<p>Director Pan Attends the Meeting on Behalf of Mayor Wu to Deliver Instructions</p>
<p>Huang Zao Xiong, Du Gang, and Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The Meeting Adjourns at 5 PM, Passing Multiple Proposals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association, with the term of the first board of directors and supervisors having expired, held its second member representative congress at the Municipal People's Education Center yesterday morning from 10:00 AM to discuss important matters and elect directors and supervisors. The Modern Thought Society presented each representative with a volume of books. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Yesterday's attendees included Mayor Wu (represented by Director Pan), Lin Meiyan representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, Jiang Jianbai representing the Municipal Education Bureau, and representatives from various districts: Huang Zao Xiong, Weng Zhi Long, Tao Guang Chuan, Chen Bai, Wang Long Zhang, Chen Ji Cheng, Wang De Yan, Zhang Ji Xin, Cheng Kuan Zheng, Chen Zhong Ji, Feng Yi Xian, Xu Ze Yu, Shen Ding, Wu Chui Jiu, Zhang Zai Bo, Sheng Zhen Sheng, Xu Pei Hang, Wu Ren Qi, and the first board of directors and supervisors: Du Gang, Ma Jia Zhen, and over forty other people.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: The meeting opened at 10:00 AM. The presidium consisted of Du Gang, Zhou Fei Cheng, and Huang Zao Xiong. Wang Long Zhang served as master of ceremonies, and Liu Shun Zai, Zhang Li Chun, and Du Shi Lu served as recorders. After performing the rituals, Chairman Du Gang first reported on the purpose of the meeting, and Huang Zao Xiong reported on the association's work. Subsequently, Director Pan, representing Mayor Wu, Lin Meiyan, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Jiang Jianbai, representing the Municipal Education Bureau, delivered instructions. Elections then followed, and the meeting adjourned for a break at 12:00 PM. The meeting continued at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, discussing proposals and revising the association's constitution. The meeting concluded with a photograph session around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: (1) Du Gang briefly stated that the tasks of today's representative congress can be divided into several points. The Municipal Education Association has been established for two years. According to legal regulations, the term of the directors and supervisors has expired, so today's congress is to elect the second board of directors and supervisors to continue their responsibilities. Secondly, a considerable amount of work has been done during the term of the first board of directors and supervisors, and the appropriateness of this work is subject to review by today's congress. Furthermore, it is hoped that everyone, based on their usual research and involvement in education, or any plans for the future work of the Municipal Education Association, can express their high opinions as much as possible during the discussion, so that the wisdom of all can be gathered to benefit the association. If the Municipal Education Association can have something to follow in the future, it will improve its performance. This is thanks to everyone, and it is also the glory of the Shanghai educational community. (2) Huang Zao Xiong reported that the important work of the association in the past two years includes raising donations to assist the Northeastern Volunteer Army, raising funds for Shanghai school airplanes, publishing the "Shanghai Educational Community," holding summer lectures, holding the "One Yuan Per Month Education Movement," and holding city-wide speeches and competitions on the New Life Movement for primary and secondary school students, etc.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address: Director Pan, representing Mayor Wu, said that the Municipal Education Association is a legal organization. In Shanghai, the administrative aspect of education is the responsibility of the government, while the Municipal Education Association is the only organization promoting it on the social and public fronts. Just now, I heard the chairman's report that a lot of work has been done, but most members have not been able to participate and work together, so the strength has not been fully utilized. It is hoped that this situation will be avoided. The government's finances are tight, and education funds are quite small, and most of them are used in school education. Public education funds account for only 5 percent. This funding is not entirely used for public schools, so the Municipal Education Association launched the One Yuan Per Month Education Movement to supplement the government's inadequate public education and eliminate illiteracy. However, it requires the strength of the entire society to achieve the goal in a short period of time. The One Yuan Per Month Education Movement can enable illiterate people to graduate in four months and learn more than 1,000 characters, costing only four yuan. Among Shanghai's 3.5 million people, there are certainly many illiterate people, but if all members of society can contribute money, illiteracy can be gradually eliminated in three to five years. It is hoped that the Municipal Education Association can continue to do this work consistently, and then it will not be difficult to reduce illiteracy in Shanghai, and it can thus influence the whole country. If education associations in various places do the same, it will not be difficult to eliminate illiteracy throughout the country. It is hoped that everyone will work hard.</p>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors: As a result, Huang Zao Xiong, Tao Bai Chuan, Zhou Fei Cheng, Chen Bai, Ma Jia Zhen, Weng Zhi Long, Chen Ji Cheng, Xu Ze Yu, Wu Xiu, Feng Yi Xian, and Zhang Zai Bo were elected as directors. Wang Long Zhang, Wang Tong De, Wu Ru Gui, Wu Ren Qi, and Yang Jing Yi were elected as alternate directors. Du Gang, Jiang Jian Bai, Hao Nai Ding, Chen Zhong Ji, Sheng Zhen Sheng, Cheng Kuan Zheng, and Lin Meiyan were elected as supervisors. Gu Yin Qian and Gu Ji Wu were elected as alternate supervisors.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: (1) Regarding the proposal to vigorously promote the implementation of the association's recommended measures to improve education in the special zone, it was resolved: A. To submit a request to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Municipal Party Headquarters. B. To jointly organize a committee to improve education in the special zone with various organizations. C. To request the Municipal Education Bureau to increase the number of schools or expand the number of classes in the special zone. (2) The proposal to request the Municipal Education Bureau to actively expand rural primary schools to popularize education was approved. (3) The proposal to request the Municipal Education Bureau to reduce or waive tuition fees for rural primary school students as much as possible to broaden education was approved. (4) The proposal to request the Municipal Education Bureau to notify the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to abolish the school admission advertising tax was approved.

(6) The proposal to request the Education Bureau to establish a production education experimental school was approved. (7) For the purpose of improving the organization of the Education Association, should district education associations adopt the regulations for holding representative congresses, and can branches be used as basic organizations? It is proposed to request the central government to amend the laws. The proposal was approved. (8) Due to the dense population and high housing prices in the city, it is not easy to obtain large school buildings. The current primary school staffing is uneconomical. Should the Municipal Education Bureau be requested to try the Gary Plan? The proposal was approved. (9) The proposal to amend the draft constitution of the Shanghai Education Association was approved. Finally, supplementary motions: (1) The proposal to request the Municipal Education Bureau to establish a secondary school in the Pu Song District to benefit students was approved.

<h3>Datong University Invited He Yingqin and Chen Lifu to Speak Yesterday</h3>
<p>He Spoke on How to Restore a Good Scholarly Atmosphere</p>
<p>Chen Spoke on the Scientific Analysis of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame</p>
<p>Since implementing national rejuvenation education last year, Datong University has spared no effort in fostering a frugal scholarly atmosphere, promoting academic research, and dedicating itself to hard work. This semester, the implementation of universal physical education and a universal tutor system has achieved remarkable results. The university also invites prominent figures to speak during memorial week to provide inspiration. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the university invited trustee He Yingqin to speak on "How to Restore a Good Scholarly Atmosphere." At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it invited Central Committee member Chen Lifu to speak on "A Scientific Analysis of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." All faculty, staff, and students attended the lectures, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The main points of the speeches are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>He Yingqin's speech on how to restore a good scholarly atmosphere was divided into five key points: First, to ensure that young people in schools develop a spirit of sacrificing for the country and the nation. Second, to strictly require teachers and students to work hard in their respective positions. Third, to find ways to make teachers and students cooperate closely. Fourth, to make school life and social life adaptable. Fifth, to pay attention to physical education and military training, and to encourage Datong University to transform into a new scholarly atmosphere, burying itself in hard work, hard teaching, and hard learning, in preparation for the rejuvenation of the nation and the strengthening of the country.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's speech on the scientific analysis of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame first argued from the perspective of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. To determine the four cardinal principles is in the hand of wisdom, to implement the four cardinal principles is in the realm of courage, and to know the principles and principles of the four cardinal principles is in the realm of benevolence. Respect and love are born from wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Respect for others is propriety, and respect for oneself is integrity. Love for others is justice, and love for oneself is shame. From an economic perspective, propriety and integrity are distribution, and justice and shame are production. Speaking of the objects of the four cardinal principles, propriety is for others, justice is for things, integrity is for objects, and shame is for oneself. Chen cited extensively, with both solemnity and humor. The entire audience applauded and cheered, gaining a powerful inspiration for the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu also gave a speech at the School of Business yesterday. Central Committee member Chen Lifu arrived in Shanghai at 7:20 AM yesterday morning on an overnight express train from Beijing. After getting off the train, he went directly to the National Shanghai School of Business to participate in the memorial week and gave a speech on "A Scientific Explanation of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame." He also encouraged the students of the school. Chen intends to stay in Shanghai for a day or two to deal with private affairs before returning to Beijing.</p>
<h3>German Minister to China Trautmann Gave a Speech at Tongji University Yesterday</h3>
<p>German Minister to China Trautmann came to Shanghai from Beijing and went to National Tongji University in Wusong yesterday. At 10:30 AM, he held a tea party in the school's reception room to meet with Chinese and German professors. At 11:00 AM, he attended the memorial week speech. Chinese and German faculty, staff, and all students of the school attended the lecture. The main idea of the lecture was "The Trends of Recent National Movements in Various Countries." Minister Trautmann believes that if human beings only pursue the development of industry and neglect rationality and ethical connections, not only will they not be able to reduce the degree of disputes in the current world, but they may also make the differences between ethnic groups more obvious. Therefore, after the European War, various countries are striving to refresh their national life, eliminate class contradictions, and concentrate power. This is not only true for European countries, but also for China. The current New Life Movement and the Confucian Movement can serve as clear evidence. After Minister Tao finished speaking, the principal of the school, Weng Zhilong, expressed his gratitude, and the guests and hosts dispersed happily. It is heard that Minister Tao will rush back to Nanjing by night train on the same day.</p>

<h3>Qian Xing Su and Others' Performance Record at the Nanchang Women's Games</h3>
<p>Excellent Performance Highly Welcomed in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang's First Women's Games Conclude Successfully</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondent from Shen Shi News Agency) The first Provincial Women's Games were held on the 14th, 15th, and 16th at the Provincial Public Sports Field. Participants included ten girls' schools: Girls' High School, Girls' Vocational School, Baoling School, Jiansheng Midwifery School, Jiangxi Middle School, Second Vocational School, First Middle School, Tianhou Palace Elementary School, and the Court Elementary School. Director Cheng of the Education Department, the president of the Games, in order to promote women's sports in the province and to allow for more observation, specially invited twelve female track and field athletes, including Qian Xing Su, who are renowned throughout the country from the Shanghai East Asia Physical Education School, to come to Jiangxi for a performance. After receiving the invitation, Ms. Qian and the others, led by Chen Mengyu, the principal of East Asia School, and Ms. Li Huaifen, the disciplinarian of the school's women's division, arrived as scheduled. They performed in the field every day, achieving astonishing results, giving the women of Jiangxi Province a very deep impression, and greatly promoting the future development of sports in various girls' schools. The process is recorded below.</p>
<p>Qian Xing Su and Her Group Arrive in the Province After departing from Shanghai, Qian Xing Su and her group from the Shanghai East Asia Physical Education School arrived in the province by train from Xunyang on the 12th. The organizing committee sent representatives Li Zonghao and Liang Yaoting to meet them at the station. At about 12:00 noon, Ms. Qian and her group arrived at the station. Li and others led them across the river and went directly to the Provincial Nanchang Girls' Middle School in Songbai Lane to rest. Those who came with Ms. Qian included team leader Li Huaifen, and team members Chen Shuqing, Chen Wanqing, Wang Huachang, Xue Zhengxia, Xu Yuan, Qin Chiming, Wang Yuying, Pan Jingxian, Pan Gui, Sun Ruiying, and Jiang Yuanying, totaling twelve people, as well as Principal Chen Mengyu.</p>
<p>The Opening Ceremony Was Very Solemn The opening ceremony of the Games was held at 9:00 am on the 14th. Over a thousand people attended, including President Cheng Shiwei, Central Committee member Ding Chaowu, Provincial Executive Committee members Wang Guanying and Yu Baiqing, Provincial Government member Li Dezhao, guests from all walks of life, female students from various schools, athletes, and Games staff. After performing the ceremony, President Cheng reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by speeches from Ding Chaowu, Yu Baiqing, Chen Mengyu, and others. Then, athlete representative Ms. Zhao Zhongying took the oath. When the Games song was sung, the sound of "strive, strive" filled the air, and the atmosphere of the entire field was very solemn. Then, there was a parade. Accompanied by sports music, the participants circled the field three times. The competition then began. Although the performances in various events were relatively immature, the performance by Qian Xing Su and others on the field greatly stimulated the excitement of the competitors.</p>
<p>Two Performances Amazed the Audience After the second program on the first day of the Games, the Shanghai ladies participated in the 50-meter performance. The participants were Qian Xing Su, Chen Shuqing, Chen Wanqing, Wang Yuying, and Xu Yuan. After the starting gun fired, the five ladies started running. Before reaching twenty meters, Ms. Chen Shuqing took the lead, while Ms. Qian fell behind. The audience thought that Ms. Qian would definitely fail this time. Unexpectedly, Ms. Qian straightened her chest and sprinted forward like an arrow. When she reached the finish line, she had already won by a chest's length, turning defeat into victory. The audience applauded and cheered. Her time was 6.8 seconds. The highest score in the competition that day was 7.6 seconds, a vast difference. When the 80-meter low hurdle preliminary was completed, Qian and Ms. Wang Huachang performed hurdle jumping. Qian's hurdle jumping skills were very skilled, and her posture was excellent. Each time she crossed a hurdle, she rose and fell gracefully, dazzling the audience. Soon, the two had crossed the last hurdle and were about to reach the finish line. At that time, Qian was still behind Wang, and the audience couldn't help but sweat for her. However, Qian increased her speed and still won by a line. Her time was 14.6 seconds.</p>
<p>Relay Performance Astonishes the Audience On the second day of the Games (15th), although the autumn wind and rain brought a sudden drop in temperature, the East Asia athletes still performed. However, the performance was greatly affected by the weather. (1) Qian Xing Su ran 100 meters in 14 seconds exactly. (2) Ms. Wang Huachang, Xu Yuan, and Pan Jingxian did the high jump. Wang was first with a score of 1.29 meters. Her posture was very good. (3) Afterwards, Qian Xing Su, Xu Yuan, Wang Huachang, and Chen Shuqing performed the 400-meter relay, accompanied by the Girls' Middle School team. At that time, there was drizzling rain and a cold wind. After the starting gun fired, Chen Shuqing set off first, followed by Wang Huachang and Xu Yuan. Qian Xing Su was the last person. After receiving the baton, Qian sprinted like lightning with a composed posture. When she reached the finish line, the Girls' Middle School team was still more than 80 meters away. The time was 55 seconds exactly. The entire audience was amazed.</p>
<p>Basketball Performance Amazes with Skill On the third day of the Games (16th), the East Asia team's basketball performance was one of the most exciting scenes. The audience gathered, surrounding the entire basketball court. The East Asia players stepped onto the court amidst cheers. In the first half, they competed with East Asia alumni (male students), displaying a hundred brilliant moves, leaving the audience in admiration. The result was a score of 10 to 10. In the second half, they competed with the Women's Games champion team (Girls' Vocational School), resulting in a one-sided situation. The Girls' Vocational School players paled in comparison. The result was East Asia 29 points, and Girls' Vocational School only 3 points.</p>
<p>General Impression is Very Deep This time, Qian Xing Su and her group of more than ten people came to Jiangxi to perform, leaving all parties with the following profound impressions: (1) Their clothing and lifestyle were very simple and frugal, costing only five or six hundred yuan, less than a quarter of what Yang Xiuqiong spent last time. (2) Qian and the others were honest and kind, and their knowledge was also very valuable. They were not overly modern or urbanized. (3) Ms. Qian's calligraphy was very beautiful, and her Mandarin speeches were clear, logical, and pleasant to listen to. This truly caused most dignitaries to express their respect.</p>

The starting point was the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau's Gengcun Station's remaining rooms, which were set up as cloakrooms and male and female changing rooms and lounges. There were two paths to climb Mogan Mountain from here: one was the old path, which was short and steep, and the other was the new path, which was long and flat. The path selected for this competition was the new path. Rescue stations and kilometer markers were set up along the road. Doctors and nurses were set up at Tianchi in the middle and at the entrance of the Railway Hotel at the finish line. All the contestants departed from the Shanghai-Hangzhou train at 7:55 am on the 20th and transferred to the Highway Bureau bus to Gengcun and started the race at 3:30. All the contestants bravely moved forward. Dong Shuzhao of Guanghua University's men's team was the first to reach the finish line with a score of 37 minutes and 31 seconds, followed by Gu Sen, the representative of Guanghua, and Zhang Daqi, the representative of Jiaotong University.

The last to arrive among the representatives of the various schools was Cartouley. The woman felt extremely exhausted halfway through and was almost unable to support herself. Although the nurse tried her best to persuade her to take a sedan chair, the woman refused, deeply ashamed of giving up halfway. Later, she managed to reach the finish line, and the spectators all admired her strong will. After arriving, the contestants were led by the Railway Bureau staff to the Railway Hotel to bathe and change clothes, and have dinner.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Unraveling, Zero Peering Door Pitiful Girl, Willing to Hear Hardships Cherishing Jade Visits Home</p>
<p>He held a thin straw hat in one hand, slowly fanning his chest, and carried a large string of mutton in the other, humming a Shaanxi tune and walking slowly past. When he walked past, he only glanced at the workers, and immediately the noisy sounds of the entire field completely stopped. Cheng Zhiqian looked at the man, then at the workers, and when the fat man walked far away, he couldn't help but smile at the workers: Who was that person who just passed by? I see you are all a little afraid of him. A worker smiled and replied: That's our boss, how can we not be afraid? Sir, have you eaten yet? Cheng Zhiqian said: You eat very hard! The worker sighed: This is nothing compared to our hometown, that's when it's hard! You people who work as teachers, how would you know? Cheng Zhiqian laughed: Some know, some don't, but I'm thinking, if it's harder than this, then you can only eat coarse grains. The craftsman seemed to think that he was too amateurish and smiled at his companion next to him. Cheng Zhiqian realized that he had misspoke, which was a little embarrassing. So he joked and laughed: I heard that you have dug a few cave dwellings here, where are they? A worker pointed to the back and said: Isn't that there? Cheng Zhiqian followed the direction he was pointing. In the back of the courtyard, there was a two-foot-high brick wall, like a flower stand, or like a fence around a pool. He immediately walked forward to see that at the corner of the short wall, there was an opening with layers of steps to walk down. Indeed, a very long and deep pit was dug into the ground, forming an aisle. On the south side of the aisle, earth was used as a screen wall. On the north side of the aisle, a dam was built, and doors and windows were dug, a row of five or six rooms, just like houses. (46)</p>
<h3>A Look at Life Then and Now</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>Living in this current era, who isn't complaining about "the difficulty of life!" Indeed, the difficulty of life has now reached its extreme and has become an undeniable fact. Compared to the "Qianlong" and "Jiaqing" years of the previous Qing Dynasty, there is a vast difference, not to be mentioned in the same breath! In the eyes of today, the life of the people at that time can really be considered as heavenly gods, achieved after several lifetimes of cultivation! If you don't believe me, there is a book to prove it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to be airing books in the sun and found a book by Mr. Lin Qin'nan, "Miscellaneous Records of Tieqiao Pavilion." After reading it through, there is the following record:</p>
<p>"During the "Qianlong" and "Jiaqing" periods of the previous Qing Dynasty, Fujian was extremely frugal. City dwellers were like villagers. Those who hired sedan chairs charged forty coins for ten miles. Prostitutes lived in low houses, and one night with them cost thirty-six coins. My friend Ding Tanghao, who was humorous, once said to me: "In the past, there was a prodigal who could enjoy wine, meat, and rice, and prostitute, gamble, and hire a sedan chair for no more than one hundred coins!" I said: 'Please tell me the details?' Ding said: 'Hiring a sedan chair from the South Gate to Jiangnan Bridge costs forty coins. There is a shop on the bridge that sells japonica rice and meat for thirteen coins. A large cup of wine costs six coins. One night with a prostitute costs only thirty-six coins. There are still five coins left, three coins for a small gamble, and the winnings are pebbles. With the remaining two coins, he buys a torch to enter the city at dusk, which is just under one hundred coins! And all evils are prepared!'" I laughed loudly!' - Note that there is a separate edition of this book now, but this article has been deleted.</p>
<p>After reading these miscellaneous records, can one not admire the ease of the lives of the ancients and lament that I was not born at the right time? A prodigal's daily expenses like this, if compared to the current standard of living, is not even one or two percent of it. Therefore, considering those people as 'heavenly gods, achieved after several lifetimes of cultivation' cannot be considered reckless or exaggerated, right?</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Shui'e)</p>
<p>The city is a cage made of gold thread, imprisoning a large group of self-satisfied birds.</p>
<p>Experience is a good book for people, but good books are only reference books for people.</p>
<p>You only feel the preciousness of money when you have spent the last few of it.</p>
<h3>The Mandarin Duck Score</h3>
<p>— Chifo</p>
<p>Recently, there was an interesting advertisement in the newspaper. The picture shows ten young men and ten young women, each holding a string. These twenty strings are combined and tied to the hands of the old man under the moon in the clouds. On each string are written the surnames of these twenty young men and women, tied together in pairs, secretly hidden in the hands of the old man under the moon. These will be the predetermined couples in the future, called "The Mandarin Duck Score." This advertisement is for readers to guess, and those who guess correctly will receive fragrant gifts such as mandarin duck pillows.</p>
<p>This novel game is really very interesting; it's a pity that we are not the old man under the moon, and I'm afraid that if we were to play the role of Magistrate Qiao, we would inevitably make a mess of the mandarin duck score, and not only would we not get mandarin duck pillows, but we would be afraid of being beaten by the old man under the moon.</p>
<p>Is the union of husband and wife really in the power of the old man under the moon? In the current era, the union of the two sexes is not only beyond the control of the old and confused old man under the moon, but also the biological parents have no control! Perhaps the old man under the moon has already resigned and retired to the mountains and forests with his old wife. The responsibility of tying the red string has been handed over to the "God of Wealth Bodhisattva."</p>
<p>The allusion to the old man under the moon comes from "Supplementary Records of the Strange and Mysterious." According to legend, "Wei Gu of the Tang Dynasty was staying at a shop south of Song City when he saw an old man examining books under the moon. Gu asked what book it was. The old man said: 'It is the marriage register of the world.' He entered the rice market and saw a blind old woman holding a three-year-old girl. The old man pointed and said: 'This is your wife.' Gu was angry and gave a small knife to a servant to kill the girl. The servant stabbed her in the crowd and ran away. Fourteen years later, Wang Tai, the prefect of Xiangzhou, married his daughter, who had a beautiful appearance and always wore a flower on her eyebrow. Gu asked about it. She said: 'When I was an infant, my wet nurse, Chen, took me to the market and was stabbed by a mad thief. The scar is still there.' Gu said: 'Is Chen blind?' She said: 'Yes.' He then recounted the previous event and was filled with awe. When the magistrate of Song City heard about it, he inscribed the shop with the name "Marriage Shop." This is certainly a myth, and in the past era of "marrying a chicken and following the chicken, marrying a dog and following the dog," it was indeed a wonderful method of consolation. Nowadays, if there is an old man under the moon, he would not have the patience to pull these messy and tangled red strings.</p>

<h3>Water Pipe</h3>
<p>— Xia Cenjuan</p>
<p>A water pipe is also called a water tobacco pouch, or a water tobacco tube. Although it is called a water pipe, it is not only used to smoke Lanzhou water tobacco. Anything from leather silk, pure silk, to the old tobacco smoked by the old uncles in the countryside can be smoked. There are three kinds of changes in the structure of the water pipe. The first kind is commonly known as the seedling pipe, which has a simple form and is more than a foot long. It is not only unsightly but also very inconvenient to hold in the hand while smoking. This kind of pipe existed as early as sixty or seventy years ago. Now it can be said to be extremely rare. The second type is improved to be small and exquisite, and the third type is even better, called a spray pipe. What is a spray pipe? Because the tobacco butt left over from smoking in an ordinary pipe must be blown out after removing the pipe head, the spray pipe does not require this trouble. You only need to raise the pipe head slightly, and the tobacco butt will be blown out. When cigarettes had not yet appeared, the water pipe also occupied a necessary position in the household. Regardless of whether they were rich or poor, every family had one or two of them. If distinguished guests arrived, in addition to fragrant tea, the water pipe had to be respectfully offered. Even if the guest did not smoke water tobacco, they would accept it to put on airs. Therefore, in the past, there was a profession in teahouses for filling water pipes. It is said that even in the Shanghai brothels, they would fill the water pipe for their lovers to smoke.</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of cigarettes, the water pipe has been overthrown and has become the end of its rope. The fate of the water pipe was almost at an end. Fortunately, there are still some elderly people who still use water pipes to smoke, maintaining its original position. Therefore, the shops that sell water pipes sigh there every day. If they do not sell other things, they will almost have to tighten their belts and drink the northwest wind. This is also one of the vicissitudes of commerce.</p>
<p>This year, the government advocates the New Life Movement, and the word thrift also occupies an important part. Therefore, I quit cigarettes and switched to smoking water tobacco. The results after a month are very surprising, because the cigarette expenses that originally cost about five yuan a month now cost less than one yuan a month for water tobacco. Moreover, cigarettes contain the toxin nicotine, but there is no toxin at all when smoking with a water pipe. It is economical and hygienic, so why not do it? With some feelings, I remembered the water pipe again. I write this to tell the people who smoke cigarettes.</p>
<h3>Drifting Fragrance from the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When we first left Shanhaiguan, most of what we saw was still plains. After passing Xinmin, the population became extraordinarily sparse, and many mountains, both high and low, gradually appeared around us. These mountains were mostly branches of a certain small mountain range, some very close to the tracks and some very far away, but none possessed any magnificent wonders. Only in the distance to the west could we vaguely see a very long mountain range, with peaks high into the clouds, overlapping each other. At this time, our imperial train was just moving forward in that direction, so the closer we got, the more it changed from a faint ink-like line, gradually turning gray, and then turning blue - a very lovely color of blue. But in fact, it was still very far away from us.</p>
<p>As I was concentrating on admiring the distant mountain scenery, I suddenly felt that there seemed to be a kind of disturbance on our imperial train. Although no one was jumping and running around, and no one was making loud noises, the order was no longer as neat as before. I couldn't help but be surprised, so I quickly asked a companion, and learned that our train would not go directly to Fengtian. At the station before Fengtian, Huanggu Village, it would stop, and for the rest of the journey, we would no longer rely on the snail-paced train, but would change to the official sedan chairs that we were used to.</p>
<p>Now that I knew that we would be getting off the train soon, I had no intention to look at the scenery anymore. And in fact, there was nothing special to see in the short distance we passed through at this time that was worth admiring. (156)</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<p>###濟南蒲菜</p>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>In the seasons of summer and autumn, from after the Dragon Boat Festival in May to the Double Ninth Festival in September, the freshest and most popular vegetable dish in the entire city of Jinan, Shandong, is called Pu Cai. Anyone who has been to Jinan and spent the summer and autumn there probably cannot help but think of how fresh and clean the flavor of Pu Cai is.</p>
<p>The shape of Pu Cai is somewhat similar to the wild rice shoots of the South, but it is absolutely white and tender. Among all vegetables, it is probably a top-tier one that can be compared. Even the most famous Bian Sun (bamboo shoots) from Hangzhou are inferior to Pu Cai. The wonderful taste can be imagined. Pu Cai can be cooked in various ways, such as braised in soy sauce or stir-fried plain. It can be stir-fried with shredded meat or mixed with dried tofu. However, the most famous dish in Jinan is Milk Soup Pu Cai. The fresh juices of meat and fish are used to cook a white soup that looks like milk. The Pu Cai is then cooked in the soup. This becomes a famous dish of Jinan, with a unique flavor. Seeing the fresh, milky-white soup and the incredibly tender Pu Cai, everyone can imagine the deliciousness of this dish and cannot help but have their appetites stirred.</p>
<p>What exactly is this Pu Cai? It is actually the cattail grass that grows in Daming Lake in Jinan. During the transition from summer to autumn, it is in its freshest and most tender period. The white and tender section is harvested and becomes this delicious vegetable dish. In Shanghai and other places, Western restaurants often use canned asparagus, which is an imported product. This is the same as Pu Cai. During the summer and autumn seasons, when Pu Cai is fresh and tender, it is purchased, cooked, and packaged into cans, then sold back to the Chinese market. However, its price has already increased tenfold. The Chinese people only know that this canned asparagus is a delicacy among vegetables, but they do not know its origin is Pu Cai. Just between this export and import, the leakage of wealth is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Among the products exported from Daming Lake in Jinan, the most abundant is Pu Cai. In addition to being cooked locally when it is in season, there are countless people who purchase it to make canned asparagus. Therefore, the production of Pu Cai in Daming Lake in Jinan is always around one million yuan each year. The main sales channel is as the raw material for making asparagus. If the quantity of asparagus imported and sold each year is compared with the quantity of Pu Cai produced, there is an annual loss of tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>When Pu Cai becomes old in winter and spring, it can be cut down and made into Pu Bao (cattail bags). The Pu Bao used everywhere in the market for packaging items is made from old Pu Cai, which can be considered a by-product of Pu Cai.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people only know how to stick to the old ways and do not think about creating new things. This naturally produced Pu Cai has so many uses and can be made into asparagus. Why not set up our own factories to process it, instead of letting other people take all the profits with a simple effort? If we can utilize this natural product and establish our own factories to produce asparagus, selling it throughout the country, it may be a way to stop the leakage of wealth.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rate Fuels Buying Spree, Gold Price Rises Another 9.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Initially Calm, Then Brisk in One Day</p>
<p>Large Bullish Investors Take Advantage of High Prices to Exit</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was initially calm and then brisk, with market conditions remaining mediocre. However, the exchange rate was unusually tight, fueling considerable buying interest. Consequently, the market rose again to above 1010 yuan. Fortunately, large bullish investors emerged, causing a setback after reaching a high. Nevertheless, the underlying trend remained tight. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw a decline in the British market and a flat American market, with exchange rates fluctuating. London spot gold fell 5.5 pence. News reports indicated that Minister Kong denied rumors of currency devaluation in our country, and the United States minted over 50,000 silver coins. Pre-market trading retreated to 94.5 yuan, a marked stabilization compared to the close of the previous Saturday. Investor sentiment remained optimistic, with large investors buying on dips but lacking supply, gradually pushing prices above 1,000 yuan. At this point, there were already rumors that the central bank's official rate would be slightly reduced. After the opening, the central bank's official rate was announced, with the British rate down 1.25, the American rate down 0.0625, and the customs gold unit up 8%. The standard gold price rose to 986.7 yuan. Investor sentiment was stable and rising, but banks became less eager to buy, and supply surged, causing prices to fall again. However, the easing of the exchange rate was temporary, and despite attempts by Chinese merchants to settle, settlements remained difficult. HSBC's official rates reduced both British and American rates by 0.25, and the price rose again above 1,000 yuan, rebounding by a strong 8 yuan. At this point, banks still had selling interest, and large investors were willing to supply, gradually pushing prices back below 1,000 yuan, although prices continued to fluctuate. Soon, the momentum of short covering waned, and prices fell briefly, but the overall trend remained robust. Prices soon rose again. With Chinese merchants unable to secure term contracts for exchange notes, the market once again saw demand exceeding supply, and the price surged above the 1,000 yuan mark. The exchange rate followed suit, tightening, and investor sentiment surged, leading to immediate price increases. The afternoon session saw prices fluctuating. Later, driven by strong buying from the Dalian group and speculators, the price of domestic exchange notes tightened again dramatically. Market buying interest was strong, and after the opening, the price gradually surged above the 10 yuan mark. Buyers immediately emerged, but with demand exceeding supply and HSBC's official rates revised downward, prices retreated but continued to rise, struggling significantly around the 10 yuan mark. Eventually, strong buying from Yuqing Yongdai and Hengxing led to lower prices. Later, banks also slightly increased supply, and large investors actively cut their long positions, gradually pushing prices back to around 10 yuan. Subsequently, although the Indian silver rate fell, the buying momentum was no longer as strong as in the morning, and the gold market experienced multiple fluctuations, although the underlying trend was upward. The market remained firm at the close. Overall, market conditions were mediocre throughout the day, but the exchange rate fueled considerable buying interest, driven by the prevailing trend, which was beyond human control. The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>

The Belgian bank released January sterling at 1/4d, and Yuanmao Yong Zhentai sold, pushing the price down to 999.3 yuan.

The opening price in the morning for near-term selling was 1/4d, and the US exchange rate was 33.125 yuan, with the British rate tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous Saturday, while the US exchange rate was flat.

After the opening, although the central bank's official rates were reduced, the banks' appetite for buying declined, and the domestic market was normal.

Later, with strong buying interest from the Dalian gang and Chinese speculators, the market became extremely tight after the opening, and HSBC's official rates were revised, reducing the British rate by 0.25 and the American rate by 0.625.

<h3>Bond Closing Prices All Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market weakened from a chaotic state, with a slight indication of short covering. Since there were only three days left in the current month's futures, and both sides still had a significant amount of outstanding balances, the current market was inevitably subject to short covering, preventing it from recovering. Yesterday's market saw a slight increase of 0.1-0.2 yuan in the opening auction, starting with the bonds from 1920. Due to more selling of No. 4, the market gradually weakened, with the largest decline being 0.45 yuan, which dampened investor sentiment. The second round of trading continued to decline by 0.1-0.4 yuan. Starting with short-term gold bonds, the prices rebounded by 0.1-0.2 yuan, with the trend entirely dependent on the different strategies of long and short positions. The market was chaotic and weak. The opening in the afternoon was the same, with the former slightly higher and the latter slightly lower, but the difference was only 0.1-0.2 yuan. The closing trend was relatively sluggish, with all prices declining by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Overall, the market fluctuated chaotically, and the trend was likely to be slightly short covering. The resulting market prices uniformly declined, from 0.051 yuan to 0.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was 17,322,200 yuan, with 20 shares of stock. The details of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<h3>The Price of Yarn Follows the Rise in Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Long and Short Positions Have Considerable Countervailing Forces</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Shape Gradually Returned to Normal</p>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation gradually became peaceful. However, the sales of spot yarn are becoming better and better. In the afternoon, the gold market rose again, so the multi-party intentions are very firm, but some parties are throwing out when the price rises. Therefore, both long and short parties have considerable strength, and the market will not experience violent ups and downs. The daily turnover of chips is shortened, and based on the current situation, all depend on the rise and fall of the gold market.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Rises One and a Half Yuan The opening of the spot yarn market was flat and weak due to the flat and weak foreign cotton, and the buying customers were not strong. The current month suddenly fell by one yuan and eight corners, and the distant months also fell. In the second round of auction, the spot yarn sales were still good, and each month rose by more than one yuan. In the third round of auction, the cotton market was not good, and each month fell back by more than one yuan. The closing was flat, and the result was a decrease of 1.2 yuan in the current month, and the rest decreased by 1, 2 and corners. It was heard in the afternoon that the gold price rose again to more than 1,015 yuan, and there were 1,400 bales of spot yarn transactions, and large households purchased them, and the market image was especially tight. Each month has risen by 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 corners. The total turnover for the day was 58,000 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 900 bales, Yuande 950 bales, Hengde 2,650 bales, Tongxing 1,750 bales, Yongchang 600 bales, Deji 800 bales, Yuanda 700 bales, Taixing 700 bales, Senkang 1,400 bales, Yichang 800 bales, and Tonghe 1,150 bales. The buyers were Daji 1,150 bales, Dafeng 2,500 bales, Yukang 900 bales, Jinchang 1,050 bales, Shenji 1,900 bales, Yuanyi 1,400 bales, Runkang 2,700 bales, Xincheng 1,000 bales, Changyu 750 bales, Deji 2,100 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise and Fall Balance</p>
<p>October 181.5 178.9 180.9 Rise 0.20 18,350</p>

<p>Total 302,400</p>
<p>Yarn Sales of More Than 1,300 Bales The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,330 bales throughout the day. The market price rose by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 480 Changsha 70 Xuzhou 40</p>
<p>Mainland 425 Shantou 30 Jiangxi 70</p>
<p>Fujian 5 Wuhu 225 Luzhou 30</p>

<h3>Post-Bidding Market Buying Activity</h3>
<p>After an initial drop and subsequent rise in the cotton market, the American cotton market conditions remain weak. Therefore, a portion of, and certain cotton companies intend to sell. However, news of rising gold prices in the afternoon prompted buyers to actively purchase, causing market prices to generally rise.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Opens Low in the Morning, High in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The opening of the cotton futures market was relatively good, but near-month deliveries were scarce and prices fell, while far-month deliveries were more expensive. During the second and third rounds of bidding, rumors circulated that a speculator named Wang was bearish, weakening market sentiment and causing prices to drop by five cents to three or four dimes across all months. In the afternoon, news of rising gold prices led to increased buying activity, strengthening the market. Prices rose by one and a half to four or five dimes across all months. The total daily transaction volume was 182,900 bales. Sales included 1,500 bales from Sen Kang, 4,000 bales from Hui Kang, 1,200 bales from Heng Da, 3,400 bales from Chang Ji, 3,900 bales from Da Feng, 2,700 bales from Sui Long, 5,900 bales from Yuan Da, 10,900 bales from Shen Chang, 7,700 bales from Tong Xing, 1,300 bales from Tong He, 1,700 bales from Xin Cheng, 4,000 bales from Tong Feng, and 4,600 bales from Run Kang. Purchases included 4,000 bales from Da Feng, 2,400 bales from Da Fu, 5,900 bales from Yu Kang, 4,600 bales from Jin Chang, 2,800 bales from Geng Feng, 6,400 bales from Rui Da, 2,600 bales from Chang Feng, 2,900 bales from Hong Chang, 8,800 bales from Chang He, 2,900 bales from Yi Cheng, 1,600 bales from Ren Feng, and 2,900 bales from Yuan Xing Chang.

<p>Grains</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Rise Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>丨Pressure from Sell-offs Before Close丨</p>
<p>The flour market opened higher yesterday, continuing the upward momentum from the previous day's close. Market sentiment was universally bullish, and buying interest was as strong as the day before. Fuxin Mill, with a substantial number of outstanding contracts for the current month, sought to cover them at small profits, further exacerbating the urgency to cover shorts. New long positions from speculators and large outside investors were very active, with domestic and international sentiment aligned upwards. The market opened higher in the afternoon due to soaring gold prices, further boosting the upward momentum. Prices rose by four and a half to three cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Subsequently, Fuxin stopped issuing contracts, and Fufeng sold off, leveling the market. However, the closing price was still significantly higher than the previous weekend, with the current month up 2.75 cents, the next month up 2.5 cents, December up 3 cents, January up 2.25 cents, and February up 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3>New Longs Drive Up Forward Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday, current-month contracts saw profit-taking, with prices falling slightly by three or four cents. However, as soon as trading reached the far months, new long positions from both inside and outside the industry rushed to buy. The flour market was rising, and while foreign wheat was slightly lower, gold prices were significantly higher, attracting new long positions and short covering. In addition, the appetite of existing wheat mills was active, and prices also rose gradually. Therefore, near-month contracts also rose by five or six cents in the afternoon. In addition to short covering, far-month contracts saw aggressive buying from new long positions, leading to even greater gains. Although profit-taking later occurred, briefly leveling prices, the market ultimately rose. The closing price for the current month was up 3 cents, November and December each up 8 cents, and January up 11 cents. Current-month wheat mills took 14,000 bags, opening at a high of $3.70, with prices varying based on quality, up 10 cents from the previous weekend.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Activity in Native Coarse Rice Sales</h3>
<p>丨High Prices for Foreign Rice Futures丨</p>
<p>The foreign native rice market was lively yesterday. Native rice prices increased, becoming increasingly popular and rapidly selling out, causing the market to rise steadily. Yesterday, native street traders aggressively competed for native coarse rice, offering 4,000 bags each of Hankou and Shashi coarse rice, causing prices to rise by five or six cents to nearly a dime. Arrivals and stockpiles of foreign native rice were low, supporting the market at a high of six or seven cents. Spot foreign rice supplies were not abundant, supporting the market. However, the new crop of pointed rice from areas downriver was entering the market, and demand was not active, leading to a firm but stagnant market situation. However, futures prices were rising, gradually increasing since the silver issue arose, leading to a gradual decline in new transactions. Yesterday, October contracts returned at $4.90, with only 100 tons traded, as囤户 (speculative merchants) were also bullish and unwilling to sell.</p>
<h3>River Rice Market: Weak in the South, Brisk in the North</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the arrival of rice from various sources was relatively plentiful, totaling over 30 boats, with about 4,500 to 4,600 石 (a unit of dry measure) of goods. Sales of 窰種 (kiln-dried seed rice) were limited to the local market, while foreign buyers continued to purchase. 青島幫 (Qingdao traders) took over 800 bags. However, due to the larger volume of arrivals, sentiment was slightly subdued, and the market, initially appearing tight, ended up softening by a few cents. Other varieties such as white rice, wild rice, and thick new粳 (japonica rice) saw weaker local demand, leading to a quiet market with prices falling by about 10 cents. 杜洋尖 (Du Yang pointed rice) also showed signs of weakness due to oversupply. Only various broken米(broken rice) varieties were unaffected, and demand for new陰飯担 (newly harvested and shade-dried rice) was sluggish, presenting a soft market sentiment.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 11 or 12 boats arrived with rice from various river ports, and river inventories remained low at approximately 70-80 boats. The market was active across various varieties, including new粳, broken粳, new Du pointed rice, aged white rice, and small-scale消續化 (continuously selling). New Yang pointed rice was scarce and selling slowly, while 窰種 was in active demand. New and aged 埠 (wharf rice), foreign pointed rice, and 陰元 (Yinyuan rice) were also sought after. Prices for broken粳, new粳, and aged white rice showed a slight softening trend, while 窰種 rice rose by 20-30 cents. New Du pointed rice added a few cents. New and aged 陳埠 (Chen埠 rice) and 客羊尖 (Ke Yang pointed rice) stood firm, with 元 (Yuan rice) adding 10 cents.</p>
<h3>Black Sesame Prices Plummet Rapidly</h3>
<p>New Yellow Soybeans Gradually Decline</p>
<p>Since the new Jiujiang black sesame crop entered the market just over ten days ago, prices have been falling daily from the first batch until yesterday. This is due to the large supply and limited sales, forcing sellers to lower prices to stimulate demand. Yesterday's market price was down another 40-50 cents compared to the previous Saturday. Central market goods were only offered at $6, down $2.90 from the initial price. White sesame remained stable, but high-quality goods softened slightly due to unfavorable conditions for Western traders. Yesterday's total market transaction volume for all types of sesame was over 1,000 bags, and prices continued to decline by a small margin. New yellow soybeans showed stable prices for high-quality goods, but secondary grades saw a gradual decline due to weakening demand and continued supply, leading to a sluggish market. Arrivals of new Pudong Du soybeans and Chongming new sand yellow soybeans were scarce, only 20-30 bags, so the market remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>White Sugar Sheet Prices Rise by 50 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market should have seen prices rise in line with the increase in standard gold and customs gold, but sales did not increase as a result. Therefore, the trend remained flat and weak. The guild quoted 24 coarse granulated white ordinary spot sugar at $18.90, unchanged. Local warehouse goods were at $18.95, down 5 cents. Transshipment goods were at $5.80, down 1 cent. Dutch red sugar saw little change, with limited sales. Local factory refined white sugar was down a small dime, with higher grades at $17.60 for No. 1, $17.30 for No. 2, $17.00 for No. 3, and $16.70 for No. 4. Taikoo sugar was down a small two dimes, with B mark at $19.80, CW mark at $19.50, DY mark at $19.30, and HX mark at $19.10. There were not many transactions in graded goods, but it was heard that a certain firm sold 700 bags of white sugar sheets, with prices up 50 cents from before.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits: Tense Market Sentiment for Walnuts, Dates, and Dried Longans</h3>
<p>The previous market for hand-picked walnuts had reached $24, but recently dropped by $2-3, causing tension. Yesterday at around 5 pm, news from Tianjin indicated that all grades of peaches suddenly rose by $2. Market prices today are bound to rise accordingly. According to reports, dates are also being purchased by outside traders, causing a tightening trend. The market should rise without falling. Since price drop, Tong An dried longans have seen their market settle gradually. Yesterday, due to customer requests, prices were increased by $2-3. Newly arriving goods are being held back and not sold in anticipation of rising prices. Market prices are also bound to rise accordingly, as this product is the most reasonably priced among all grades of dried longans.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>New Crop White Tung Oil Nearing Arrival</h3>
<p>Since a Western firm in 漠市 (Moshan) sold 100 tons of white tung oil for $28.40 per担 (picul) based on Western standards, transactions have only been in the dozens of tons in the past few days, and the market has remained unchanged. Although the Western firm is not continuing to do business, supplies are also scarce, so the situation is still stable. However, the new 台新 (Taiwanese new oil) is imminent, and the old oil market has become weak. It cannot be used as a standard, and all locations are focusing on pricing new oil. The prices being quoted in 漢市 (Hankou) a few days ago were only around $25, but there has been no further business. There is a possibility for further price drops. Zhejiang tung oil is also gradually weakening. Wenzhou oil is being offered for delivery in November at $25.50 per 砠 (bushel). Although there are no reports of similar offerings in Hangzhou, the prices are likely to be similar to Wenzhou oil. Local Western firms have also been conducting a small number of futures transactions, reportedly for November delivery at prices of $26.40-26.45 per担 (picul), supposedly conducted by Japanese firms, but the truth is unknown.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Prices Have Fallen to the Bottom</h3>
<p>丨Expected Strong Sales Market After New Crop Arrival丨</p>
<p>The new asphalt crop is nearing harvest, while inventories of old oil remain high and sales are extremely poor. Letters from Hankou detail a continuous stream of supplies and only sporadic sales. As a result, heavy 荆 (Jingzhou) oil has reached $14 after import duties, while plain 荆 oil is only at $13.30-13.40, and Macheng oil is around $13. Although local traders have little inventory, sales are nearly nonexistent. The market is listless and sentiment is depressed. Some foreign goods have arrived, but it is difficult to open the market. Heavy 荆 oil is at $16 per 砠 (bushel) based on foreign standards, but traders are not eager to buy. Offered prices are $16.20-16.30 for heavy 荆 oil with wood, $16 for oil without wood, $15.30-15.40 for plain 荆 oil, and slightly over $15 for Macheng oil. However, prices have fallen to the bottom, and further declines are unlikely. However, soap factories have no use for it, and sales rely solely on candle making, which is limited. Therefore, observing the current inventory, even if the old oil is sold out before the new crop arrives, the new oil may not see strong sales. But because candle factories everywhere are actively using up their inventory, they will need to buy when the new crop arrives. Therefore, the sales market may become active after the new crop arrives.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>New Arrivals of Thin Galvanized Iron Sheet</h3>
<p>Due to previous shortages of thin galvanized iron sheet, various traders were actively purchasing, leading to a very good market. Standard prices were soaring, such as $1.45-1.46 per sheet for 3-foot 7-inch sheets, $1.25 per sheet for 3-foot 6-inch sheets, and $1.50 per sheet for 48-sheet American goods. However, eager buyers depleted market inventories, disappointing later purchasers. Recently, new arrivals of over 20,000 sheets, including British and Japanese goods, have been reported. Upon hearing this news, buyers have been actively purchasing. It is said that two or three thousand sheets have already been sold yesterday, and many construction traders are still negotiating, so market prices have not declined yet.</p>
<h3>Spot Supplies of Tobacco Tinplate Exhausted</h3>
<p>The recent purchases of tobacco tinplate by Tianjin tobacco and 青 traders have been favorable, so arriving goods have been nearly completely purchased. Standard prices have opened to $11.45 per bundle, and spot supplies in the market have been exhausted, so most traders are offering forward contracts. Yesterday was a weekday, but still hundreds of bundles were sold. Contracts for goods arriving by the end of this month opened at $11, goods arriving in the first ten days of next month opened at $10.06, and goods arriving in the second half of the month are estimated at $10.02. The most purchased contracts are for goods arriving this month.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Fleeting Sales of French Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, French firm Credit Lyonnais reported that the Lyon raw silk market remained quiet. However, Chinese silk prices have risen sharply due to the rapid depreciation of the French exchange rate. In the past two days, the market price for white factory and Jing factory brand grades has increased to over $560 (Chinese currency) per bale, and the 三跳舞 (Three Dances) brand grade to over $520, a sharp increase of $40-50 compared to the beginning of the week. Yesterday, the French mail ship Ile de France exported only 274 pieces of yellow and white silk from firms such as Credit Lyonnais and Da Chang to Marseilles. The sales of French silk are fleeting.</p>

<h3>The Exercise of Wrist Power</h3>
<p>— Ju Sheng</p>
<p>The employment of wrist power is a principle that everyone in the present day must know and master. For the sake of eating, needless to say, everyone must employ their flexible wrist power in order to achieve perpetual victory in the world of the "rice struggle". Those who do not know how to employ wrist power are behind the times, they are 'foolish'!</p>
<p>In fact, wrist power is not only employed for the sake of eating. Because with the flexibility of wrist power, after having a full meal, people still cannot forget it, in the hope of obtaining other things besides food. However, the situation is seen more truly and clearly in terms of eating.</p>
<p>A small clerk who earns thirty yuan a month is trembling with fear all day long, paying attention to the department head's expression, handling official matters perfectly to earn a word of praise or a smile of approval. On the one hand, he must employ wrist power to make the director, who is not compatible with the department head, see that he is loyal to the director... Those who have flexible wrist power can please both sides and keep their jobs. If you do things with conscience, you can only sit at home!</p>
<p>As for the director level, they are not at ease either. They must make their superiors see that they are loyal, and make their subordinates have the enthusiasm to support them, and they themselves want to gain some real benefits from it. Therefore, the employment of wrist power must be even more flexible. A person who is nominally real and praised by the masses must have wrist power that others cannot reach. The so-called genius is perhaps this kind of person.</p>
<p>For one's own sake, it is natural to employ wrist power. If you want to trap, squeeze out, or attack someone, you must also employ your wrist power! You must make them feel the bitterness of "a mute eating Coptis chinensis" invisibly, and you yourself are safe and sound, getting what you want! The so-called "killing without seeing blood", "killing without using a knife", is this. It is the employment of wrist power.</p>
<p>Fabricating facts, spreading rumors... are all ways to employ wrist power. However, everything is changing with each passing day, and everything is progressing. It can be seen that there are countless new ways to employ wrist power!</p>
<p>If you trust others too much, or you are too honest, that is by no means your advantage, but your weakness; if you cannot play a little wrist power, you are too "young and inexperienced"! Then you are 'foolish'! You are a fool!</p>
<p>The employment of wrist power is necessary in all situations. No matter who you are dealing with, no matter whether the other party is a great man who talks about beautiful terms, a student with a square hat who has studied abroad, a pioneer of the new era... when they are all Chinese, they will use wrist power to deal with you; if you do not know how to use it, are you not falling behind?</p>
<p>Learn! Learn from society! The employment of wrist power is necessary for us!</p>
<p>However, however,... ah! There is no need to turn around and say it, right?</p>
<h3>Moonlit Night</h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>The moon shines round and bright overhead.</p>
<p>The water ripples, and the reeds on the shore are blown by the wind in a rhythmic way. In the distance, the trees are dense and black, but their outlines are carved by the moonlight. The mountain peaks are crawling on the ground like lions, seemingly always raising their heads to exhale. It is so quiet that even the sound of barking dogs cannot be heard. This clear and pure moonlit night seems to fully tell us: "Autumn is truly great!"</p>
<p>We rowed a small boat and swayed on the lake. Apart from the sound of the oars and the water, we were all silent. Really, only in this way can we appreciate the taste of stillness.</p>
<p>We abandoned the boat and landed on the not-so-steep mountain peaks. At this time, overlooking the entire town, it was all in sight, but we could not see any lights or hear any subtle sounds. We were very happy. Some people let out a long howl, releasing the depression in their chests. Some people sang in a low voice, seemingly expressing a moment of joy. I looked around at my companions, and everyone had a proud look on their faces. Probably the usual worries, at this bright moon, have been washed away by the mountain scenery.</p>
<p>Time will not come again. In this beautiful and delightful time, everyone's forgetting themselves and cheering is not to be condemned. However, good times do not last long. When we discovered that Yi Ping was bowing her head in sorrow, we became bored again.</p>
<p>The reason is that Yi Ping chanted two lines of poetry: "The people who came to enjoy the moon together, where are they now? The scenery seems to be the same as last year." It turned out that compared to last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, there were three or four fewer mountain companions who came together.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, this has become a three-year-old story.</p>
<p>Now I live in Shanghai. At this bright moon, although there are still one or two old companions with whom I can talk, the scenery is no longer the same, so what fun is there to speak of. Even more thinking of the old companions in the hometown, under the cool moonlight, swaying on the lake and mountains, checking the companions who are as rare as morning stars, and then reciting the old poems chanted by Yi Ping, I am afraid that not only will there be a lack of interest, but also a sadness that wants to be cut off.</p>
<p>Gathering has no fixed time, and the whip of life is always driving us, so why should we be sad and mournful.</p>
<p>Let him bury himself deep in our hearts, my friends, never remember again.</p>
<p>We really need to embark on a new path.</p>
<h3>Imagining a Portrait of Someone After a Breakup</h3>
<h3>Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The small red door of Old Master Li's new house opened, and Wang the Old Man walked out with a mournful face. Judging from his dejected look, his request to Old Master Li had again been denied. Since the beginning of autumn, Wang the Old Man had walked out of this small red door more than ten times, each time with a more sorrowful expression.</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, how is it? Still nothing?"</p>
<p>Standing in front of the opposite Japanese-style house, the mother of Li Sanzi asked with concern.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, don't mention it. In this year, really, how am I supposed to live?"</p>
<p>Wang the Old Man replied dejectedly, and then walked across the road. At this time, he was thinking, "The Li Sister-in-law's family must have something to eat!" But as he approached the Li Sister-in-law, he noticed that her face was different from a few days ago. A few nights ago, after failing to borrow rice from Old Master Li's house, he had come to her house for a meal. At that time, she and her son seemed very happy, talking and laughing to comfort him. But today was different. The Li Sister-in-law's face seemed to have just been crying, with streaks of tears, and her eyes were swollen and unfocused. He thought, "Are they like me too?"</p>
<p>"Li Sister-in-law, where is Brother Sanzi? Is he still doing business in the city?"</p>
<p>When the Li Sister-in-law heard her son's name, tears fell from her eyes. Wang the Old Man was immediately stunned. He couldn't figure it out for a moment and didn't know what to say to comfort her.</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, I'm really heartbroken! Just three days ago, he went to the city to do business and was arrested! Those damn devils, I don't know what wrongs I've committed in my previous life with them. He's a good son, Old Man Wang, you know, he's always been an honest and law-abiding child. But they said he was a rice-robbing criminal and should be imprisoned. Old Man Wang, you think, he's my only son, and I've been counting on him to support me for the rest of my life. But now those damn devils have arrested him. What am I supposed to do?"</p>
<p>The Li Sister-in-law spoke while crying, and by the end, she was sobbing uncontrollably. Wang the Old Man really didn't know what to say. He could only comfort her by saying:</p>
<p>"Ah! Li Sister-in-law, don't cry. Crying won't help. I think Heaven won't let good people suffer unjustly. A good child like Brother Sanzi, Heaven will eventually pity him. You should still go and ask Old Master Li to think of a way to save him. I think Old Master Li is your uncle, so he's closer to you than us. Surely he won't watch Brother Sanzi suffer unjustly in vain?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Old Man Wang, don't mention our old uncle. Rich people won't pity poor relatives. I've already looked for him, but not only did he not think of a way for me, but he also said that I spoiled my son, leading to this result today. What can I say?"</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>?</p>
<p>"Hmm, there really are such heartless people in the world!"</p>
<p>Wang the Old Man sighed and lowered his head. His stomach, which hadn't eaten anything for two days, made him unable to endure it any longer. He said goodbye to the Li Sister-in-law and dragged his heavy legs towards the house of Master Ma in the West Village.</p>
<p>The autumn sun was gentle. On this vast plain, when it reached dusk, the purple light of the sun shone on the earth, and a golden picture was beautifully draped over the plain. Although the fields were full of withered rice straw and the decaying bushes scattered on the ridges, the barren land accentuated the golden beauty. Wang the Old Man walked out of the West Village dejectedly. He stared at the withered rice straw, lost in thought. The autumn harvest, for him, was a despair.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>I do have a bit of a liking for peace and quiet. If the place I live has too many children, or if the people are too complicated or too noisy, it would be very difficult for me to live there for any length of time. Therefore, moving house is like a regular occurrence for me.</p>
<p>This new house I moved into is indeed very nice, and it’s also very quiet, as quiet as a Zen temple. There are no children in the house, and the third floor is still empty. I’ve been living here for two days, and what do the landlord and landlady look like? I have no idea at all. According to that young woman living in the back room on the third floor—who was the one who showed me the house when I first came to see it—the landlord runs a candy factory, and the landlady has to go to the factory with the landlord during the day, not returning until late at night. However, after living here for a short time, I began to have doubts about the young woman’s background.</p>
<p>This woman lives with her husband in a narrow back room on the third floor. Judging by her age, she couldn’t be more than twenty. Her appearance is quite pleasing: with a melon-seed-shaped face and a slender, graceful figure. But her home is very simple. Besides her husband, there’s also an elderly “Mama”—supposedly her own mother. Yet why does she willingly let her sleep under the staircase every night and work for them like a servant during the day? At first, I really couldn’t stand to watch it, and I felt a faint sense of indignation.</p>
<p>Her husband is a young fellow just like her, but he has no masculine spirit at all, hiding in his bedroom all day long, not even daring to step out of the front door.</p>
<p>Every day, as the sun sets, after having dinner, this young lady invariably dresses up in a gaudy manner, puts on rouge, and leaves her husband, looking charming and moving, to go out with her mother, not returning until the clock strikes two. “Where on earth does she go out to stroll? Doesn’t she get tired of strolling like this every night?” I couldn’t help thinking this as I heard her slow, weak, seemingly exhausted footsteps moving on the staircase.</p>
<p>But the young lady’s secret was finally discovered by me one day by chance.</p>
<p>That day at the Great World amusement park, I saw this young lady talking and flirting with a middle-aged man. Their attitude was so intimate, flirtatious, and gentle… Ha! Ha, this young lady, her secret has been completely discovered by me tonight. So, I no longer dared to pass in front of her, and I quickly left this dark place.</p>
<p>“Ah, this young lady—her youth and soul have been completely ravaged by the demons of this city.” As I returned, I couldn’t help sighing like this.</p>
<h3>East, West, South, North</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>Our national essence is “Everyone sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn’t care about the frost on his neighbor’s roof.” Although this antiquated saying cannot be applied to modern times, the fact that people are selling Japanese goods with a clear conscience is like a bomb. It’s just too unlike “All within the four seas are brothers.”</p>
<p>It’s natural to be young and impetuous. For the sake of a small matter, they fight until their eyes and noses are swollen. Not to mention that our bodies and hair are received from our parents, but sticking plasters on ourselves is ultimately a losing proposition and not worth it.</p>
<p>Striving for honor rather than wealth still has some reason to it. Spending a few dollars is ultimately a small matter, while the face gained can allow you to give a loud and satisfying thumb’s up for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>We have been shouting to boycott Japanese goods until we are exhausted. What can be done about the national tendency to grab bargains? If you want to love your country, then manufacture cheap domestic goods. Without a boycott, there will naturally be a boycott. Things like the kneeling-and-crying group, with their tears streaming down their faces, are simply laughable.</p>
<p>Love for one’s country should be in one’s heart. If you say you don’t buy Japanese goods and you haven’t bought Japanese goods, if you can do that, then without a boycott, there will naturally be a boycott. Why trouble yourself to throw bombs?</p>
<p>Nothing is more tragic than the death of the heart. Love your country as much as you want, but unscrupulous merchants will still be unscrupulous merchants. The front wave pushes the back wave, and Yue Lai succeeds Yue Lai. The example of Liu Chongwu is a warning.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday’s “East, West, South, North” article, the Shanghai Xingye Bank was incorrectly referred to as the “China” Xingye Bank. We hereby correct this.</p>
<h3>Selling Articles and Signing Names</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Selling articles seems like a beautiful thing on the surface, but in reality, it involves many pains, especially for those who rely on writing to make a living. However, this fact is often overlooked because objective imagination is not reality, and the true situation can only be understood by oneself.</p>
<p>Selling articles, in the eyes of an objective observer, might be seen as “a thousand words at the desk, ready to be written,” and naturally, along with that, the rustling of silver dollars would also be “readily available.” This might happen, but it’s probably not very common.</p>
<p>Here, some people see the loveliness of the “rustling” and forget the pitifulness of the “desk work.” Thus, more people write articles. As a result, the “pitifulness” not only isn’t avoided, but instead increases, while the hope of “readily available” often doesn’t come true.</p>
<p>In order to compete, the need for “signing names” was discovered. Originally, signing names wasn’t a big deal, or it could be said that it didn’t have a very significant meaning. At most, it was just to conceal the reality of one’s real name for the convenience of writing.</p>
<p>Now, this seems to have become a trend. It’s very common and not surprising for one person to have more than one signature, even up to five or six. Because it’s not surprising, a signature that isn’t a big deal has been clouded by a kind of misfortune. It is not only invited by Zhang San to help out, but also has to entertain Li Si’s social occasions. If you’re not careful, Zhao Wu next door will also invite it to say a few words. Thus, it holds several positions and is extraordinarily prominent.</p>
<p>Naturally, prominence is a glorious thing. Since you’re “kindly not rejected,” it’s “good luck” shining upon you. This is something to be pleased about. There’s no need to register it at the trademark bureau, and there’s no need to be too stingy and claim it as private property. Because the name belongs to the public and should be used freely.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhuge is known as Crouching Dragon. He decided the division of the world in his heart. Since the first battle at Bowang, he wanted to use fire to attack Cao’s troops. He first issued the order to Zhao Zilong. Three rounds of drums narrated the heroes. There was also Zhang De. It is said that he has been trapped in the dragon for a long time. He hated that his elder brother listened to Xu Yu directly. Crouching Dragon Hill hired Xiang Nong three times. Zhang Fei was scared, and your horse was quick, and the tip of the spear was sharp. He wanted to capture Cao’s soldiers, but he failed. Xiahou Dun forced An Lindao. He was injured and it was difficult to repay his merits in one day. The gentleman had already decided in his heart. Xiahou Dun’s Yangshou had not ended. From then on, Zhang Fei admired him in his heart. See how he repays his merits. Why did he apologize with Jing on his back?</p>

<p>Opening: Baoyu Sacrifices to Qingwen</p>
<p>A beautiful scene and a good time are approaching. The hibiscus is full of eyes and doubles the sadness. Red faces have always been ill-fated. It is a pity that the disease has left its soul. The little maid is sad and lonely, and Baoyu is full of tears and wets his clothes. Tonight, Ping Fan respectfully offers ice shark valleys. A sprig of incense is sent to the spirit of hibiscus. Sister, your spirit has not disappeared from the White Emperor Palace. Descend to the flower before you and do not refuse love. Sister has been in the world for sixteen years. There are only five years of companionship. He was born with a beautiful appearance better than ice and clear water. Flowers are ashamed of the moon and are beautiful. You were born with intelligence and suffered from heaven’s jealousy. The cuckoo is evil and ancient. Since you have been saving suffering and pitying the dead, where can you find your fragrance in the future. It is heartbreaking to hear that the comet’s coffin has been burned. It is difficult to fulfill the feelings of a common cave in this life. I once remembered that the eyebrows and the green smoke were still painted by me. To this day, the finger ring is cold and the jade is borrowed from whom. The remaining medicine in the cauldron still exists. The tears on the lapel are still stained with new ones. Now there is no one to tell the dream in the empty room. The shadow is also zero. At this moment, the dew on the stairs is dark and the fragrance is faint. I can’t bear to listen to the sound of crickets chirping all over the ground. But I didn’t expect the crabapple to wither and not be a good sign. So far, the parrot in front of the curtain is still calling Qing. In the yellow earth mound, Qing is ill-fated. There is twice as much affection under the red gauze window. Separation from life and death was originally determined. How many people have seen happiness and wisdom? I will wait for me to practice Zen alone and abandon the world.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Completion of the World's Largest Submarine Tunnel</h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>The Queen's Tunnel, which connects the two major cities of Liverpool and Birkenhead in England, is not only the world's largest submarine tunnel, but also one of the world's greatest engineering feats in recent times. Not long ago, the world's largest submarine tunnel was completed by the British Emperor and Empress, who came from London to Liverpool to attend the inauguration ceremony, presenting Liverpool with an unprecedented grand occasion. The construction of the tunnel, from the laying of the foundation stone to its recent completion, took more than eight years and cost a staggering £10 million. During the construction period, the government established a tunnel working committee to oversee the project. The tunnel working committee searched throughout the United Kingdom for all the famous engineering designers and architects, so that there was not a single engineering designer or architect in the country who was free to build the submarine tunnel, which shows the magnitude of the project, and truly opened a new era in the world's construction projects. The tunnel goes deep into the seabed, so that even the ships with the deepest draft in the world can pass over it without any obstruction. The tunnel is five miles long and about forty-four feet wide, and can accommodate four cars running parallel to each other at the same time. When this great project first started, despite the painstaking efforts of architects and engineering designers, many workers still sacrificed their lives inside. The cause of death was mostly due to the suffocation of air in the tunnel, which made it impossible to breathe. Because it is very difficult and impossible for the air to flow as smoothly as on the ground in a long and deep tunnel. But later, after long-term and meticulous research by the architects, they built three ventilation towers at each end of the tunnel to regulate the air inside and outside the tunnel. This project was done very perfectly, so people who pass through the tunnel now feel no different from being on the ground, and there is no feeling of suffocation at all.</p>
<p>Now, let me write down some of the scenes of the inauguration ceremony of the submarine tunnel at that time:</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony was held in Liverpool on July 18 this year. That morning, the Emperor and Empress of England took a train from London to Liverpool to preside over the ceremony. The residents of Liverpool were overjoyed to meet this unprecedented event and were almost ecstatic. Wherever the Emperor and Empress passed, there was thunderous applause. People waved the national flag from the roofs and windows to express their warm welcome. Wang Street at the entrance of the tunnel was even more crowded with people, packed like sardines, waiting for the arrival of the Emperor and Empress. On both sides of the tunnel buildings, there were lively male and female elementary school students wearing colorful clothes, which attracted the attention of the Emperor and Empress. After the Emperor and Empress arrived in Liverpool by car, they changed to a car to Walton Park. The park was also completed at the same time as the submarine tunnel, and the Emperor took the opportunity to hold the completion ceremony. After the ceremony, they drove to Wang Street. When the crowd saw the Emperor and Empress driving to the street, they cheered in unison. It was almost noon, and the ceremony began. First, the Emperor inspected the army, and the Queen inspected the Red Cross Brigade in the Lancashire Army. After the inspection, the Mayor of Liverpool and Sir Witacre, Chairman of the Tunnel Working Committee, delivered welcome speeches in succession, followed by a speech by the Emperor, thanking the national construction workers and workers for their concerted efforts in completing this unique and magical project in the world. At the same time, he expressed his respect to those workers who died for their work. After the Emperor finished his speech, he pressed the button on the table in front of 150,000 people, and the curtain at the entrance of the tunnel automatically opened. The Emperor and Empress then took the car and set off for the tunnel first, led by the Liverpool Police Music Team. The car drove from the slope to the entrance of the tunnel, and they saw the words "Welcome Your Majesty" made of electric lights. Behind the Emperor's car, countless vehicles of nobles and civilians went one after another. Within an hour, a total of 2,500 vehicles had passed through.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that, except for the opening ceremony day, the Liverpool City Government posted a notice that pedestrians are not allowed to pass through at ordinary times, except for those driving cars. This point is also the "fly in the ointment" after the completion of the world's largest submarine tunnel.</p>
<h3>Architects in China</h3>
<p>— Ya Jie</p>
<p>An architect is the only person who assists in making buildings stand tall and magnificent; modern skyscrapers and mansions have to go through the architect's preliminary design, construction supervision, post-construction arrangement, and constant advice. This is recognized by every Chinese person with a little common sense, but recently there has been a common phenomenon that there is a very strange understanding of the architectural engineering profession, that is, anti-architects are classified as upper-class, luxury, and people who diminish social production. This new concept is certainly due to the Chinese people's failure to thoroughly understand the detailed situation and specialized knowledge of the construction industry, resulting in a misunderstanding. At the same time, the professionals themselves cannot shirk their responsibility for neglecting their own business, or even being despised. This is certainly undeniable;</p>
<p>Originally, the rise and fall, size, importance, and influence of the construction industry on the increase or decrease in the number of architects are on the same line and are directly proportional. In other words, if a country needs a large number of buildings, strives to develop the construction industry, and vigorously seeks solutions to the people's livelihood, then the cultivation and recruitment of specialized personnel is inevitable. Otherwise, the result will be the opposite.</p>
<p>Reasoning from the perspective of architects serving the society and doing their best, it is impossible to equate them with general luxury goods, such as priceless treasures, expensive and gorgeous cars, and other goods purchased with large sums of money, or to further compare them, or to include them in the necessities of daily life, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the four major elements of life, it does not seem inappropriate. Because the spirit of architectural engineering and the business of architects are both to serve society and benefit the people, and they will do their best to reduce the burden of the owners. Even if it has reached the minimum limit, they will try to find ways to avoid extra expenses. However, ordinary people not only do not understand this, but instead think that the cost is only more and not less. The lack of common sense and the unclear understanding are deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>However, the occurrence of things, as well as the beginning of rumors, must first have a cause and then a result. Then, the slander that architects are considered to be appendages of luxury assets must have a cause, and it is definitely not a baseless rumor. Therefore, in the future, Chinese architects should strive to make up for the aftermath, think of ways to reverse this kind of fallacy, and create another style, so that the Chinese people will have another new concept and new tendency.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why the advocacy of the above fallacy has not been extinguished to this day is that some professionals have neglected their business or have a lazy service spirit, resulting in this. If they can each broaden their horizons, not be concerned about the lack of profit in the entrusted business, or not focus their thoughts on the views of the great buildings being entrusted, then there are few individuals who will not succeed, and their status will not increase accordingly. How many people in the country can pay attention to this point? There are still people who can understand it more deeply, so that the reliability and cost-saving of architectural professional technology can penetrate the hearts of the people and be imported into the folk, so that they can thoroughly realize that the so-called lower-level work can be attractive and confusing. Try to compare the medical and architectural industries, which are the same specialized academic and sophisticated technologies. The former is universally recognized by the world and regarded as a necessity, while the latter is discriminated against and regarded as a luxury. Is the latter's academic technology slightly inferior to the former, or are there more patients and is it more important than building houses? One is that academic theories and skills penetrate the hearts of the people and are respected by the world, and the other is that the understanding is insufficient and the impression is shallower. The error in viewpoint leads to discrimination, and the evil thoughts in the necessary principles lead to loss of faith. I hope that the architects in our country should catch up quickly, so that the service purpose and benefits can be widely promoted, so that even peddlers and pawns in the folk can know its wonders, and they will believe in it for life. Naturally, the business will be inextricably linked with the public, and at the same time, the fallacy will be extinguished, the reputation will increase day by day, the career will flourish, and the status will increase invisibly.</p>
<h3>Waterproofing for Buildings</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>Our country's architectural industry has been progressing rapidly in recent years. Engineering is becoming more grand, and designs are becoming more meticulous. Consequently, preventing water damage and dampness has also been recognized as an important issue. Dampness in buildings is not only detrimental to aesthetics but also unacceptable from a hygienic standpoint. In factories and warehouses, it can lead to rust in machinery and mold in goods. Furthermore, for buildings with underground pits or water towers, waterproofing is even more crucial.</p>
<p>Waterproofing may seem simple, but it is actually quite complex. The waterproofing methods for underground pits differ from those for walls, and the methods for roofs differ from those for water towers. For repairing underground pits, chemical substances are needed to make the cement solidify within seconds to withstand pressure of hundreds of pounds per square inch. Walls require transparent waterproofing materials that do not compromise the original aesthetics. Roofs need durable and resilient materials, while water towers require non-toxic materials. Since the materials vary, the methods also differ, requiring specialized study to understand.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of waterproofing types and methods, as described above, manufacturers of waterproofing materials must possess unique knowledge, extensive experience, more than ten exquisite products, and dozens of well-trained workers to meet the demands.</p>
<p>Dealers in building materials in Shanghai often lack a complete range of waterproofing materials and are not very clear about their usage, causing inconvenience to users. The Yale Manufacturing Factory has specialized research on waterproofing materials and projects, and is considered unparalleled in our country. To promote widespread knowledge of waterproofing engineering, the factory has published a booklet entitled "Building Waterproofing Methods" for reference by the construction industry. It has also established an engineering department to provide consultation and undertake various waterproofing and repair projects, greatly benefiting various sectors.</p>
<h3>Japanese Paper Houses</h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>A Miracle in the Architectural World</p>
<p>Our eastern neighbor, the Yamato people, though standing among the world's first-class powers, seem to possess a national character of ingenuity and fickleness, which is perhaps not highly praised by the world. Their industrial manufacturing, especially for export goods, is particularly frivolous. Even in the realm of children's toys, they generally prioritize cost reduction and labor savings, aiming for quick profits. For a long time, our country has been their sole distribution point. Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the people of our country have awakened, on the one hand shouting for economic severance, and on the other hand earnestly creating domestic goods. From both active and passive perspectives, it seems that we truly possess a great spirit of striving for strength! However, what is the actual situation? We see reports of "reciprocal trade treaties" and continuous compromises. Considering the past abnormal state of being their "exclusive agent" and "sole distributor," we find that there is trade but perhaps no true reciprocity. This is an extremely contradictory matter, without any doubt! However, it must be said that the above discussion is all beside the point and has nothing to do with the main topic, so there's no need to dwell on it. Only the four words "ingenuity and extravagance" are relevant to the following brief account in this article.</p>
<p>In the Japanese architectural world, there is an architect named Kyo Gorō who invented a type of "paper house." Just imagine: building a house for people to live in entirely out of paper, how ingenious is that? And that a house can actually be made of paper, how changeable is that? This is not only a wonder of the world and a beautiful tale in the architectural circles of various countries, but also, in a country frequently plagued by earthquakes and typhoons, these paper houses can solve the housing problem and greatly avoid or reduce the degree of danger. Kyo Gorō's creative motivation originally arose from the hope of resisting earthquakes and typhoons, but whether his future endeavors will be successful remains uncertain. The architect is currently working hard to refine his designs without any discouragement. Therefore, people generally predict that this ingenious structure will be able to make new contributions to the architectural world and provide considerable benefits to the changeable people of that nation. As for our thoughts on disaster relief and helping our neighbors, we do not discriminate based on hatred. Therefore, we also deeply hope for its success, opening a new era in the architectural world. If it can be further promoted for practical use, then the people living in a country plagued by frequent typhoons and earthquakes can rely on these paper houses to protect their lives, which would indeed be a blessing for humanity.</p>
<p>The main material for building these paper houses is the best quality Manila paper weighing over 100 pounds. This paper is highly adhesive and the most durable in its class. Its length and width are also very large. The walls, roof, windows, and all important parts of the house are made by pasting this Manila paper together. However, the thickness of each part varies, with the number of layers ranging from several to dozens. Each layer of paper is coated with thick white glue, and the outermost layer is covered with fish oil. After prolonged shade drying, various beautiful patterns are added, making it resistant to wind and rain without peeling off. To prevent strong sunlight from scorching the fish oil and white glue, causing them to melt and lose their adhesion, which would result in the house collapsing and the skylights opening, a scientific method is used to create a chemical solution that resists sunlight and is applied to the roof and walls to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The supporting beams, door and window frames, and wall joints are all reinforced with extremely thin copper strips and iron hooks, the weight of which is minimized to prevent injury if they fall.</p>
<p>In the architect's overall plan, it is estimated that each fully completed paper house requires approximately 25,000 sheets of Manila paper, about 200 catties of fish oil and white glue combined, and about 140 pieces of thin steel strips and small iron hooks. The equipment is not very simple, and all necessary structures are included, not differing much from houses built with tiles and wood. Kyo Gorō is from Mooka Prefecture in Japan, a region surrounded by mountains and water, where earthquakes and typhoons are frequent, even during the pleasant days of spring and autumn. Living in constant fear for his safety, Kyo became deeply resentful. Therefore, he devoted himself to research for more than a decade, leading to the initial completion of the project. Furthermore, the entire house can be disassembled and assembled anywhere at any time. In other words, it can be moved and carried without any hindrance. It can also be called a traveling house.</p>
