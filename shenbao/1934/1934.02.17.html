<h3>讀敎育部高等敎育統計·廷</h3>
<p>最近國府敎育部編製全國高等敎育統計多種。綱舉目張。有條不紊。而其含意之深遠。尤足引起吾人之惕厲自省。茲篇所論。卽以該部（我國二十年度高等敎育與世界主要各國比較表）及（我國二十年來國内高等敎育統計表）二者爲根據而由縱橫兩方審察我國高等敎育之現在地位者也。</p>
<p>上述第一表包羅世界獨立國家二十月二。英帝國之屬邦六。爲數不謂不（</p>
<p>多。而我國高等敎育界之畸形現象。乃獨凌駕乎任何邦國之上。試加分析。不下三端。（一）每萬人中中之學生數。以中國爲最少。（二）每百學生中之敎育數。以中國爲最多。（三）平均每校學生數以中國爲最少。（惟紐芬蘭蕞爾小邦除外。）而校數則高居第三位。</p>
<p>第二表以民國元年至二十年間这各年度爲經。各統計事項爲緯。茲將元年度與二十年度爲簡單之比較以見二十年來我國高等敎育首尾情形之一斑。</p>
<p>元年度　　百分比　　二十年度　百分比</p>
<p>校數　專科　一一一　　　　　　　三○　　　　二七　　　大學　　　四　　一○○　　七三　　一、八一五敎員　　二、三一二　　一○○　七、○五三　　三○五學生　四○、一一四　　一○○　四四、一六七　一一○　　由此可知二十年來敎員人數之增加凡三倍。而學生人數之增加僅十之一。再觀高等敎育機關之分配。亦有特殊之變遷。卽專科慘落及大學勃興是也。</p>
<p>綜合第一第二兩表縱橫雙方之所顯示。則可得如下之斷語。</p>
<p>（一）學生人數太少。其遞加也綦緩。足見高等敎育之不發達。以我國人口四萬萬七千萬爲比例。每萬人中才有受高等敎育者一人。在二十年之長時期中。所增加者。不過一成。實渺乎其微。夫國家建設。民族復興。胥有賴於人才。我國人才之缺乏。如此國勢衰弱。自所不免。</p>
<p>（二）敎員與學生人數之比率獨高。其遞加也綦速。足見優秀人才之無出路。中大校長羅倫氏嘗論中國大學敎育之危機。以爲我國人才特感恐慌。實因（政府與學校搶人。學校與學校搶人。）此言固當。但轉念以我國人才之少。而懹抱利器鬰鬰不得志者。尙所在多有。其幸焉者除投身官塲與敎育機關以外。鮮有出路。則羅氏的指與學校搶人之事實。亦殊不足深怪且進一步言。所謂（用非所學學非所用）之情形。在全國各階層内幾無往而不然。供求雙方失其調劑。故或則有人浮於事之感。或則有人才恐慌之嘆。</p>
<p>（三）大學勃興。專科慘落足爲高等敎育畸形發展之鐵證。我國二十年來。專科減少。幾及四分之三。而大學之添設。則在十八倍之上。按專科性質除極少之例外。皆爲理農工醫等實科。而大學學生。則以攻讀文法敎育藝術等科者佔絕對多數。似此重（文）輕（實）之學風。萬不足以應付今後之非常環境。學國已有定論。至於高等敎育機關興廢無常。可爲政治混亂社會杌隉之反映。更不待言。</p>
<p>上列缺憾。顯而易見自非急起直追速圖補救不可。吾人以爲補救之方。第一當積極以求高等敎育之進展。第二當開闢各種新事業。以安插優秀之人才第三當打破敎育界重（文）輕（實）之心理而根本辦法又不外乎謀政治之清明。與社會之安定。</p>

<h3>社會黨革命慘敗奥政局當起劇變</h3>
<p>叛黨餘衆竄入山林</p>

<p>内衛軍成奥國中堅</p>
<p>維也納　星期四日爲社會黨起事之第四日、革命之火炬雖仍態態之焚燒中、但火焰已漸趨衰弱矣、</p>
<p>杜爾夫斯總理曾限叛黨及時投誠當加寛赦、但至上午十一時限滿時、降者寥寥、於是政府軍復猛攻社會黨所盤踞之各地點、社會黨顯抱寧死不降之志、抵御甚猛、</p>
<p>截至昨晚止、死難人數究有若干尙未能查明、維也納居多不知慘禍之重大、惟社會黨估計、佛洛里期道夫區之惡戰、黨人死者約五百人、他處約百人、</p>

<p>社會黨領袖有若干人被拘、年齡自十八至二十七不等、公訴員要求判處死刑、現除一人名加勒者已處極刑外、餘犯猶未審訊中、</p>

<p>由維也納京城通出之各路、大有戰時景象、沿途有兵士站立、大砲以馬曳之、機槍則載以敞車、奔馳前進、軍灶與救傷車均凖備待發、行人每五十步輒受騐查護照、車輛悉被搜檢、</p>
<p>昨晚多瑙河對岸洛保隰地集有困鬥而被擊散之黨人、維也納起事之社會黨生存者似僅此而已、</p>
<p>自星期一日起直至昨日、維也納城心始未聞一槍聲、居民現復照常理其營業、上奥地利亞各處政府軍均已得手、尋常生活亦漸趨恢復、</p>
<p>據斯台爾最近消息、社會黨由該處退至附近林木菁密之山坡者、現以機關槍作最後之抵禦、林資西面亦尙有戰事、林資本城則已恢復常狀、各方面預料黨人子彈漸罄、無新接濟、將成釜底之魚、故不久可告肅清、</p>
<p>昨日當局從事沒收社會黨之産業、上奥地利亞省六十四區之市議會、社會佔大多數、均經解散、</p>
<p>據新估計、黨人與政府軍陣亡者及人民中流彈而死者、其總數約在八百人左右云、</p>

<p>維也納　社會黨繳械投降者已逹數萬人、今僅餘城外數處、尚有黨人負嵎、但已失奮鬥精神、夜間未向政府軍挑戰、今日政府下令、宣布城中所設之有刺障礙物、均將於星期五日拆除、城中與四郊之街車、均已開馳、足證政府深信已能控制大局也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納　社會黨奮死對政府軍之抗拒、已成强弩之末、聞工人現紛紛棄社會黨而降政府、社會黨設防固守之地、多懸白旗、惟社會黨指揮處似尚未决定停戰、今日仍廣發傳單、勸工人竭力抵禦、普稱旦夕將有四方同志由各省馳抵、援助解圍、維也納大敎長英尼碩已發表一文、籲請奥人不問屬何黨派、立卽終止流血、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>奧内衛軍總司令之表示</h3>
<p>奥人不歡迎國社主義</p>
<p>惟須要强有力之獨裁</p>
<p>（倫敦）奥國内衛軍總司令史太漢堡在林資對倫敦晨郵報訪員稱、奥國未有行使國家社會黨制度之可能、國社黨主義有殘忍性質、非奥人所觀迎、奥國現心須有一權力無限之狄克推多、至新憲法可適當施行時而後止云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納　除偏僻省分外、杜爾夫斯總理與内衛團現已成奥國之主人翁、但社會黨現似採行别動隊新戰略、今日清晨維也納城内斯台特公園發生槍聲、蓋副總理費少佐乘車過此、有人圖狙擊之也、維也納各街現漸復舊觀、事業照常進行、禁止夜行令現已變更、咖啡館與劇塲可營業至夜間八時、某工廠與軍營中現拘禁社會黨二千餘人、奥國各處已設立臨時法庭、有權判定死刑、現已開始審訊、林資現以歐戰時充絞刑吏之某染匠爲劊子手、奥國政局現甚混沌、衆將内衛團領袖吏太漢堡今日晤杜爾夫斯總理時、將提出切實採行法西斯制度之堅决要求、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納　奥國之戰事、其始如怒潮之疾至、其終如暴雨之驟止、種種戒備計畫、今仍實行、未經取銷、現内衛團已恊同軍隊從事繳社會黨戰士之械、消防隊於戰事進行時、屢以秘密消息傳與社會黨、故其總部今已由内衛團佔據、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>華沙　猶太人約五百名、今日由奥國洛特士與附近一帶逃抵此間、蓋彼等料社會黨必將完全失敗、此後奥國國家主義派將起而掌大權、猶太人向來參與奥國馬克斯派之運動、以是覺宜未雨綢繆、而遷地爲良也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>奥内戰之國際嚴重性</h3>
<p>英法勸奥總理寛大處置</p>
<p>意捷凖備對付外力問鼎</p>
<p>德又借題發揮躍躍欲試</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨日外間傳説、有數大國駐奥代表曾以半官式手段警告總理陶爾斐斯、謂奥政府將社會黨被捕人員處以死刑、已在外國發生不良印象云云、本日每日電聞報、證實此項傳説、謂英國政府係以極婉轉極友誼形式向陶爾斐斯及奥内閣表示、希望能在勝利之後、出以寛大熊度、法國政府亦有同樣表示、英國政府所以出此者、全爲人道起見、不能視爲一種正式交涉云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）最近奥國事變、在國際關係上或能發生影響、但捷克及小恊商其他兩國與論則靜觀變化、本日外長巴爾都與捷克外長貝勒斯二人對於奥國事變、大約曾加深刻研究、兩國應採何種態度、當已商得同意矣、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>布拉哈捷克斯拉夫外交長克羅夫太博士、在衆院外交委員會演説、謂捷克政府不欲干涉奥亂、但奥國如受外方攻擊或請援於外、則捿克政府擬提出抗議云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬外國若干方面消息、謂意政府對於奥國時局擬以武力干涉、以便恊助陶爾斐斯政府恢復治安、並曾向英法兩國試探意見云云、實則意國並無干涉之意、惟奥國若在軍事方面受外來威脅、則意國始有援助奥國之理由耳、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）國家社會黨宣傳員哈皮許脱（卽前德國駐奥使館情報專員、爲奥國政府驅逐出境者）、今晚用無線電廣播演説、討論奥國時局及國家社會黨在奥國境内所持之政策、哈氏指責陶爾斐斯政府、不應向各國政府聲訴德國干涉奥國内政、國社黨對於近日奥國事變、不負任何責任、哈　氏繼又猛烈攻擊陶爾斐斯内閣、責其破壞日耳曼民族之利益、而使歐洲和平感受危害、目前情形、無異各國在奥國境内爭奞奪利益、國社黨目擊此種爭鬥不勝感慨、該黨决不無故犧牲一人一彈、但若依照國家社會主義解决奥國問題、則無論何時國社黨凖備犧牲以求逹到目的、哈氏結論謂、（奥國執政者對日耳曼民族負有重大責任、現當醒悟、以種種方法避免最大危險、（指共産黨主義）卽今圖之未爲晚也）、云云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>奥社會黨起事係内衛軍促成</h3>
<p>民治共和已爲砲火所毁</p>
<p>國家主義已成此後大敵</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞中歐特别訪員電稱、奥亂與共産黨無關、乃内衛團領袖壓迫杜爾夫斯總理實行該團於一九二九年行而未果之計劃所促成、奥國民治共和今已爲政府之砲火所摧毁、且犧牲生命甚多、此次亂事平後、杜氏尚有一大敵在、卽國家社會主義是也、又泰晤士報維也納訪員稱、社會黨估計至星期二晚止、同黨罹鞹者有一千五百人之多、而死於佛洛里斯道夫鏖戰中者尚不在内、現信加爾馬克斯賀夫一處死者當有三百五十人、内多無武裝之居民云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>布拉哈今日正午、布拉哈各業均停止工作五分鐘、對奥國社會黨戰士表示同情、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）眞理報論奥國事態云、最重要之革命事件、正在中歐發展、彼已衝破小小奥國之疆界矣、自法蘭西之工人提出反對日益無恥之反動與法西主義之口號、而一致興起後、奥國工人之英勇戰爭、又得證實資本主義歐洲炙手可畏之氣燄、眞理報復述及多數社會民主黨及工人自衛組合之工人、竟不顧社會民主黨領袖之訓令、與共産黨工人携手作戰、蓋此次運動已遠離此等領袖之手、同時奥國事件復得證明歐洲反法西鬥爭之浪潮、已如何高漲云、（十五日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>法再答覆德國維持軍縮主張</h3>
<p>對德提議一槪不答</p>
<p>柏林方面準備再覆</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國對德軍縮備忘錄之覆文、其要點爲德國國家社會黨挺進隊必須視爲軍隊、至於德國所提出之各種建議、及附列之各種問題、法國一槪不答、據柏林路透電稱、德政府方面認法國覆文無補於軍縮、因法國所申述者、仍爲德國所不承認之點也、惟覆文並未封閉日後談判之門、此乃可認爲滿意者、德國將於適當時期中答覆之、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德國政府曾於本年一月十九日以關於軍縮問題之備忘錄致送法國政府、最近法國内閣已備文答復、由駐德大使龐賽面交德外長牛賴脱、其内容頃已宣布、法國復文謂、法國政府於本年一月一日致送德國之備忘錄、曾將關於軍縮問題具體而有精確之計畫通知德國、乃德國政府一月十九日來文、仍謂軍備强大各國不願採取眞正有效之裁軍辦法云云、此種論調當由德國完全負其責任、</p>
<p>法國政府對於下開兩層、深爲婉惜、第一、德國對於軍備監察制度、究竟如何看法、一月十九日來文、未能予以充分説明、第二、法國一月一日致德國之備忘錄、對於不侵犯條約之範圍、及其與羅卡洛條約所當具有之關係、曾表示意見、而德國政府迄未注意及之、</p>
<p>此外有兩種問題、法國視爲有基本關係者、卽（一）法德兩國之軍力只能以本部軍額作比較、且必將一切有軍事性質之力量、包括在内而後可、（二）和平條約禁止德國使用之軍器、必俟德國軍隊改組之後、始能畀予德國、至德國受有軍事初步訓練各團體、以及正式軍隊以外之軍事團體、應一併歸入軍額計算、同受軍縮公約之限制、乃德國政府將此兩點均拒不接受、卽將一月一日法國備忘錄所載之計畫全部予以拒絕、</p>
<p>綜上以觀德國一月十九日備忘錄附列各項問題、法國政府認爲無答覆之必要、</p>
<p>緣所列各種複雜問題與軍縮會議在會各國全體相關、僅由法德兩國自行談判殊覺困難、如必欲由法德兩國間先作初步之研究、亦必彼此對於各種精確之原則成立妥恊、方爲有益、顧事實上絕非如此據已經公佈之文件、德國軍隊之能力、就其組織·軍額·及所用軍器而論、殊與凡爾賽條約所載規定不相符合、而凡爾賽條約規定、乃日後比較兩國軍力時所不能不引爲根據者也、</p>
<p>至國際上對於軍備之有效監察制乃將來軍縮公約之主要因素、必須迅速予以規定、法國所以希望於軍縮公約開始實行時卽組織有效國際監察制者、其故以此、種主張、對於德國國家之威嚴、不見有何損害、</p>
<p>除此以外、法國並無意以海外軍隊補充本部軍隊减少之額數、而海外軍隊亦無使其不受限制之意、此正與德國所推想者相反、</p>
<p>最後言及最重要問題、法國復文謂、軍縮公約所限制者、指一切有軍事性質之力量而言、如正式軍隊以外之軍事團體與軍隊化之警察、均在其内、此法國之主張也、而德國備忘錄竟拒絕之、法國之意、仍維持其素來之主張、如一方訂立軍縮公約、一方又將正式軍隊以外之軍事團體、究竟有何軍事價值一層、置諸不問、而留待後來决定之、是軍縮公約根本已先動搖、其中軍備監察一層所關尤重、未便掉以輕心、如此公約非法國所能簽署者也、現應由德國政府明白解説、以消除或預防種種含混之點、此種解説、法國將虚心研究之、因是法國政府仍維持一月一日備忘錄所列之主張、法國政府對於德國合作之志願及誠意、深信不疑、第以爲意見參差之處、凡足以妨礙最後妥協之成立者、彼此如能加以承認、并坦白討論、而求其互相接近、實與雙方談判無何損害也云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>鳩山文相受賄五萬元</p>
<p>政友會内部大起紛爭</p>
<p>（東京）岡本議員於十五日衆議院本會議披露之鳩山文相綱紀問題、三土鐵相與黑田大藏次官之綱紀問題、現爲各方面注目、查問委員會開始審查本問題、則其影響必及貴族院、議院外部亦同時實行運動究明本問題、綱紀問題之内容曝露、則鳩山·三土·永井·各相地位危險、政界一部擬以本問題之澈底追擊、奪去齋藤内閣之生命、又有一部份已經開始繼任内閣之凖備云、綱紀問題在查問委員會之發展如何、能使政界發生一大變化、其前途最堪注目、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>司法省調查鳩山文相綱紀問題</h3>
<p>（東京）小山法相因岡本昨日在議會曝露鳩山文相之所謂樺太工業五萬元問題、惹起一般注目、鑒於本問題之重要性、卽時命司法省調查眞相、以便應查問委員會之要求、證明問題、據司法當局調查之結果、</p>
<p>（一）樺太工業公司之背任侵占事件、於昭和五年賣勳事件發生時曝露其内容、但鳩山並未因此問題被控告、</p>
<p>（二）樺太工業公司贈與岡本五萬元、並非事實、</p>
<p>（三）樺太工業公司社長大川平三郎、對於鳩山供給選舉費五萬元係事實、但此係個人的行爲、並無犯罪性質、（十六日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>綱紀問題原因在政友會内部爭鬭</h3>
<p>（東京）民政黨認綱紀問題對於今後政局有重大關係、而與内閣命運有直接影響、故對於本問題考慮萬全之應付對策、今次問題之發生、實因於政友會内部鈴木派與反鈴木派之喑鬭、而反鈴木派之勢力比鈴木派優勢、反鈴木派使本問題擴大之目的、以岡本所提之綱紀問題害傷鳩山文相、由政界埋沒其影、然則鈴木總裁不得不負推舉鳩山入閣之責任、引咎辭職、政友會内部此項爭鬭露骨、則必將分裂爲兩派、或吏挨總裁、以計統一黨部、否則不能取復政治常道、挽回政黨信用、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>鼎足而三形勢政友會陷於無統制</h3>
<p>（東京）政友會内部糾紛愈趨惡化、關於開除黨籍、又成困難問題、雖已求得長老之諒解、面長老中之望月圭介與床次竹二郎兩人及其顧問等、均嚴然不爲之動、故開除與否均不能决行、黨内乃陷於無統制狀態、如幹部派·久原派·床次派·均取對立形勢、事態激化、頗難解决云、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會因岡本一已之綱紀問題、致向來之内爭表面化、幹部頗憂虚此形勢、鈴木總裁與鳩山文相等、已自昨夜來集合恊議對策、惟岡本之背後、現悉有久原系之一部與床次系之一部在策動、故决定斷然處分開除不穩分子、今日下午之幹部會、决定開除津雲國利·倉元要一·難波清人·高倉寛·西方利馬·及吉田鞆明等六名、此外長島隆二之行動、亦成問題、但不開除、（十六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會幹部會所决定、黨内不穩分子津雲國利等之除名問題、係鈴木總裁與鳩山文相所强硬主張、惟床次·岡崎·山本條·山本悌·前田·秋田·浜田·山崎等之長老幹部等、均反對此舉、又有總務之大多數亦不穩之反對意見、故除名事、恐將發生問題、（十六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會内之糾紛、因久原派關於岡本一已氏所指摘之綱紀問題、認爲煽動反鈴木之空氣、而該總裁派則給與以反攻、床次派亦投入漩渦、開始策動矣、政友會幹部顧及事局、恐内部糾紛擴大、致使政黨政治之信用墜落、而有損議會之品位、故擬首先斷絕禍根、乃將十五日議塲之實情觀察、凡屬露骨搗亂内部及其該項企圖者、均須開除黨籍、以防問題擴大、十六日晨、由總務幹事等商𣙜結�</p>
<p>果、已將前除名辦法决定、其應開除黨籍者、如津雲利國氏·難波清人氏·西六利馬氏·預倉寛氏·聞經長老之諒解後、當於十六日實施、其强硬派則主張此外之吉田　明·長島隆二·倉元要一·等三人、亦須開除、並迫幹部實行、一方面久原派則與之對抗、並講求各種對策、倘幹部派實行其開除黨籍之處分、則决計在黨内奮鬥到底、政友會内部糾紛愈形表面化、似此形勢察之恐難免分裂云、（十六日日聯電）</p>

<h3>東北財政與貿易之現狀（長春通信）</h3>
<p>因捐税繁重經濟凋敝</p>
<p>各國市塲被日人侵佔</p>
<p>東北經濟凋敝、致農村中現方濔漫所謂（豐年飢荒）、考其原因、實爲特産之豐收與其海外銷路之閉塞致之、然僞政府之苛捐雜税、當亦爲其原動力之一、蓋僞政府之歲入、卽以捐税爲其最大部分、捐税旣重、則經濟之凋敝與農村破産、自爲必然、</p>
<p>爲明瞭此項捐税於僞國歲入中所占之成分、茲特節錄去年度（去年七月一日至今年六月卅日）公佈之預算如下、</p>

<h3>蔣委員長演講復興民族基礎</h3>
<p>從敎養衛三字十做起</p>
<p>勉各人明璋自已責任</p>
<p>南昌通訊、贛行營於昨（十二）日上午九時、召集本省黨政軍各機關、舉行擴大紀念週、到有營行各廳處組長、省府全體委員、省黨部各委員、以及各機關主任上上人員、茶二百餘人、由蔣委員長領導行禮、並對出席人員訓話、勉以各人認清責任、以爲復興中華民族之基本工作、其訓詞大意、照錄如下、</p>
<p>江西的剿匪、關係國家的生死存亡、中國民族有無復興的希望、就看江西的赤匪能否剿清、我們要復興民族國家、必須由江西來做一個基礎、無論是黨政軍各界的同志、凡是在江西地方的、人人都負有此種責任、大家一致在江西剿匪的環境之下、來造成復興民族的基礎、惟國人向有一種毛病、就是不明本身責任、亦不知自已能力、旣不明責任、又放棄能力、所以遇事只好因循延誤、數衍塞責、在此國家生死存亡之際、豈可一誤再誤、所以現在無論是黨政軍那一界的同志、各個人都要有認清責任的精神、尤其是剿匪中心的南昌、爲整個剿匪精神的地點、凡是在南昌的同志、都應該檢查自已的責任和能力、來格外努力、埋頭苦幹、造成一種風氣、要使南昌的風氣、濔漫到全國全天下、那末、中華民族才有復興的希望、此點爲本人所希望於各位同志者、</p>
<p>然而自已知有責任而不能發揮出來、此亦等於不知、故能明白自已責任、尤須將責任告訴别人、要使一人之責任、而發生千百人之效力、此卽在能明自已責任者、而更能指揮到他的部屬、如政府之指揮公務員、軍隊之指揮士兵、指揮就步驟、而後才能督促部下、倘能督促到部下都能明瞭責任、則剿匪工作、定可收事半功倍之效、大學云、物有本末、事有終始、知所先後、則近道矣、就是説事有先後厚薄之分、倘先後倒置、厚薄不分、則决不成功、敎人先明責任、是先使其明黃任而做、然後能够完成此種工作、才是領導得人、</p>
<p>剛才説過、復興民族基礎、要在江西剿匪地方做起然此種做法究竟、怎樣做呢、現在先把他的大綱來談、就是敎·養·衛·三字、古人云、十年生聚、十年敎養卽此三字之意思、故此三字的工作並不要武力、而其所發生之力量、比較武力還能大上百倍、惟此種敎法、不能像學校敎師的敎法、只憑書本和黑板而已、必須要人人皆能得到敎導、隨時隨地皆敎、使無地而非學校、無人而非敎師、然後方能完成此項工作、關於怎樣才能達到敎的目的、怎樣才能達到養的目的、怎樣才能達到衛的目的、此種責任、要怎樣才能實現、現在且分析一談、（一）敎之意義、在將已所知者、而指敎於人、凡政府所知者、敎於人民、黨部所知者、敎於黨員、上官所知者、敎於職員、軍隊所知者、敎於部屬、警察所知者、敎於社會、無論其爲政府委員、黨部委員、軍隊長官、公安警察、但其所知而不敎者、卽是他的倒霉、然敎之意義何在、卽（禮義廉恥）四字、古云禮義廉恥、國之四維、四維不張、國乃滅亡、我們現在要復興民族、復興國家、所以要提倡禮義廉恥、如全國上下、能人人知禮·知義·知廉·知恥、則民族精神自然興起、吾人欲圖復興民族、卽須以廉恥爲武器、（二）養者育也、育之義何在、卽總理所講的人生四大要旨（衣食住行）、大凡一個人、從出生起、都不能缺少此四字中之一、食衣住行、一定要有紀律、才能表現一個人精神、如果一個人吃飯無定時、穿衣不清潔、住房子不整齊、行路不守秩序、則其爲人也、散漫頽廢、可以想見、故食衣住行條件有四、卽經濟·清潔簡·樸素、合乎四種條件、才是合法的衣食住行、由食衣住行之觀察、小則可知各個之性情、大則可以表現一國民族風度、而食衣住行之表現、亦卽禮義廉恥之實行（三）衛是民族團結之表現、然衛之工作、本卽介乎敎養二者之間、若是敎養二、做到、人民能够明瞭責任、以及禮養廉恥、曁在食衣住行之起居行動有一定紀律規則、則自知團結自衛、反之則不然、故衛之消本辦法、在於敎育其次治標之法、在嚴守紀律、服從命令八字而八字之連貫、又卽（共同一致）四字、今日自衛、實爲重要治本之法、卽不及實施、只好治標、無論政府軍隊黨部社會等、均應嚴切導守（嚴守紀律服從命令）八字、俾能共同一致、則可以團結自衛了、以上敎養衛合併而言、卽是（禮義廉恥食衣住行共同一致）十二字、此十二字做到、就是復興民族的基礎、惟此項效力之實行、重要於敎、卽剛才説過的、能够明瞭自已責任的人、把這些去敎訴、人家指揮人家、嗣後無論是黨政軍政府社會個人、均爲隨時随地注意到敎、而尤其重要者、爲警察與學校、因爲警察是社會的敎師社會良否、就看警察辦的如何、學校是人民的敎師、人民的程度進化須靠敎育薰陶、此外各個人皆宜負責共同一致、復興民族之基礎云工作、方可奠定）云、（二月十三日）</p>

<h3>川康考察團視察糖鹽兩業</h3>
<p>内江資中之糖</p>
<p>自流井之岩鹽</p>
<p>均因税重衰落</p>
<p>成都通信、自重慶至成都、計程一千餘里、飛機兩小時可達、如乘長途汽車、則因沿途多山、迂迥盤旋於峻嶺幽谷之間、需時兩日、方能完程、内江位蓉渝之間、自流井在内江之南百二十里、考察團於二月五日清晨、由重慶出發、晚抵内江、六日破曉、乘滑竿兒南行、下午四時至自流井、七日從事鹽井與火井之考察、八日返内江、九日復乘汽車、至下午五時到成都、爲時凡五日、計程一千二百四十里、而考察時間、僅居八小時而已、茲記糖鹽兩業狀况如次、</p>
<p>自流井鹽水過濾（泡渣黃桶）（王開振寰攝）</p>
<p>糖業</p>
<p>内江資中一帶之糖、以所産甘蔗爲原料、製法極簡、先以牛力轉動兩個鐵筒、甘蔗經過其間、汁水卽被榨出、積得若干蔗水之後、加石灰使之澄清、再注入釜中、用火煎熬、使水份蒸發至相當濃厚時、更移注缸中、待其冷却、糖卽結晶析出、然後加泥士於其上、使糖與母汁受壓而分離、於是將糖取出、曝於廣塲中、以待其乾燥、最後裝包輪出、　其所用器械、都極簡陋、且有許多機會、可使微菌穢土屬入糖中、故其成品、顔色黃黑、飲用之時、一經溶解、卽有多量雜質、沉澱器底、故極待改良其製法也、更有一點可注意者、爲熬糖所用之燃料、現因煤炭價昻、卽以榨餘之蔗充之、此榨餘之蔗中、仍含有糖質、且有合乎造紙之織　、今一舉焚之、殊爲可惜、聞有民業公司者、將籌辦一鐵路、由内江經鄧井關至滬州、如該鐵路得完成、則内江所需之煤、可以輪來、内江所産之糖與自流井所産之鹽、亦便於輪出、</p>
<p>内江糖業、受經濟敝之影響、呈每况愈下之狀、去年出口之糖、總值四百二十五萬九千元、政府徵收糖税約一百三十萬元、至各地徵收之税額、數目不同、難以統計、大約白糖一萬斤、自内江運至成都、應納正税四十元、附税竟達三百元左右、故若非從速减少税額、糖商且有破産之虞也、</p>
<p>鹽業</p>
<p>鹽業自流井之鹽爲岩鹽、在地下二百丈至三百丈之間、鹽層共三級、每級約厚三尺左右、採取之法、先請陰陽風水先生、　定地點、搭成木架、用人工以重四百餘斤之鐵椎下擊、復用竹管等件掏出石屑泥漿、計須費時三年之久、乃成一井、其口徑不滿一尺、深凡二百餘丈、有時耗資十餘萬、並無鹽水可得、若有鹽水、則以鐵絲繩縛長竹筒入井汲取、此種竹筒長約五丈、每筒鹽水、可煮成鹽二百七十餘斤、有時遇固體之鹽、則須在隣近之處、更開一井、灌入清水、使鹽質溶化、然後汲取之、所以運用此鉅大竹筒之法、係採最簡單之滑車絞盤機械、藉人力或牛力推動之、大規模之鹽井、亦有用簡單蒸汽引擎者、取出之鹽水、經過竹管、流入大鐵釜中蒸發、使鹽析出、</p>
<p>煮鹽之燃料、因該處地下適有天然瓦斯、掘井使共噴出、點火卽燃、用之不竭、間有不足之時、則以煤炭補充之、</p>
<p>目下産鹽之量、每年約三百萬擔、以每擔三元計算、約共值九百十萬元、近來廢井重開者甚多、産量日增、政府徵收正税、年約千餘萬元、附税則視所經地點與路程長短而異、無從統計、鹽商資産、鹽行共約一千二百萬元、灶商一千六百萬元、井商五百萬元、共計三千三百萬元、政局安定時、各商均有利可獲、鹽業工人共約十餘萬人、每人每日可得工資一角餘、伙自流井燒鹽灶（王開振寰攝）</p>
<p>食由商家供給、銷路以湖北爲大宗、向來每年可銷一百十餘萬擔、今産量雖增多、而銷路反减小、去年僅及原數三分之一、今年更有縮减之勢、原因在川鹽税高、淮鹽税低、如在宜昌、川鹽每擔納正附税九元四毛、淮鹽僅六元之譜、故售價亦不得不有高低、大約川鹽在宜昌、每擔售價八元餘、淮鹽則僅七元左右而已、因淮鹽傾銷之故、川鹽商人所受打擊極大、並影響四川税收、然以川鹽成本旣較淮鹽爲大、（</p>
<p>不能减價競爭、若欲爲川鹽維持銷路、一方固在徵税當局之調劑、一方川鹽業自身、亦當努力於生産技術之改良、庶可减低成本、或逕爲川鹽覓一新用途、方能解决、否則以生産遇剩累積、恐釀成川鹽業之總崩潰也、</p>
<p>總觀自流井與内江之鹽糖兩業、本爲天然富源、且已有相當規模、年來因税高價落之結果、日就衰落、前途至爲危險也、（力行二月九日自成都發）</p>
<h3>鎭江桐油業之不振</h3>
<p>|各商號大都虧折|</p>
<p>鎭江通訊、江廣油業、在商業上居重要地位·其經營之盛衰、攸關市面榮枯、昨據該業中人痛述客歲貿易狀况·及營業不振之主因、爰誌如次、（本埠經營江廣油業之油商、計有吉盈豐·和濟·大昌豐·乾泰·慶祥·恒大·衍源·范炳記·楊椿記·豐記·恒生等十餘家、西帮則有劉同慶·徐榮昌·楊恒源等數家、江廣業之資本及營業、厥推吉盈豐、該號爲邑人張貫之所首創、資本二十餘萬、開設已八十餘年、曩年經營、漁利頗厚、近歲已趨失敗、緣所進之油分（皮油）（洪油）（秀油）三種、皮油運自鄂屬荆州麻城等處、洪油秀油出自贛省、洪江皮油市價、每擔（百斤）刻售二十餘元、（洪秀油價與皮油同）客歲各號、洪油雖銷售踴躍、每擔獲利一二元、然皮油與秀油貿易衰落、則每擔虧蝕三四元、兩者相較、明雖獲利、充核之餘、咸耗本不資、吉盈豐因開支浩大、迭受打擊、而各股東又復意存觀望、不愿增加股本、以致一蹶不振、至西帮慶元豐各油號、因僅經營洪油、故獲利頗豐、此客歲油業慘敗之情形也、（十六日）</p>

<h3>摩登性寒腿病·瞿·紹·衡</h3>
<p>（歡迎轉載）</p>
<p>寒腿這個病名是北方的俗語、因爲北方的氣候寒冷、發生這個毛病的人較多、所以能够引起大家的注意、小區客在北方的年數很多也曾嘗過這個病症的滋味、並且有過一度的研究這種毛病、我初以爲是北方氣候的關係、那知道從去年遷回家鄉的上海之後、也是照樣有不少同樣的病人、尤其是青年的女性、問問年老的長輩、都説他們年輕的時代、沒有聽見過這種毛病、因之我敢大膽的説、上海本不該有這種毛病、現在所以發生的緣故、那摩登的裝束、的確是一種極大的原因、所以我給牠題一個名稱呌作摩登性寒腿病、我想要是這樣摩登下去、這病一定會蔓延到不可收拾的地步、於國民的健康、於民族的盛衰實在要發生重大的影響、所以編作這篇文章來喚起大家的注意、</p>
<p>寒腿的原因就是從腿上接受的寒氣變成的、原來宇宙間的空氣、無論屋内屋外、總是上層的稀薄、下層的濃厚、並且熱的空氣、因爲容積膨脹的原故、往上昇騰、於是那間圍沒有膨脹的空氣、就來補充牠的地位、因這上昇下降的結果、就會生出風來、（俗名地風、）我有一個很明顯的證明雖是老戲法請大家試一試、就是拿兩支洋蠟燭、都點上火、一支放在門框的上方、一支放在門框的下面、請看那火焰的方向、一定是上方的往外、下面的往内、這是空氣在無形中流動的鐵證、還有縉事情、説出來是大家經騐過的就是冷天在屋裏打牌的時候、要是有人開了門不關、那些打手、必定要在醉心於中發白清一色的中間、猛覺得脚上有冷氣、要異口同聲的呌喚關門的口號、這樣看來、人身對於寒冷的刺戟雖然全身一樣在空氣之中、但是因爲體位的關係、下身兩是所受寒氣的侵襲、要特别多些、在氣候温暖的地方、當然是滿不在意、然而在氣候寒冷的地方、就不能不注意了、你看上海的洋車夫、都是光脚鴨的、北方的洋車夫、都是長袍鞋襪、儼如一位先生、我當初以爲是北方的洋車夫有規矩、後來才知道是因爲北方的氣候太冷、所以民國十九年白崇禧的赤脚兵到北平的時候、在夏秋兩季、固然沒有問題、後來那無情的北風一起、這些光脚鴨的丘八爺、也都受不了啦、你看北方人穿的毛窩、多麽笨啊、穿的棉褲、多麽厚呀、難道説北方人都不愛漂亮麽、實在是冷得不得不然罷了、他們忙着這樣的注意、還有不少的寒腿病發生、但是近機年來、歐風的輪入、好像風電一般的迅速、在青年的女子方面、尤見得厲害、在冬天時光、也穿着草鞋式的皮鞋、肉露露的絲襪、牛頭式的單褲、開口跳舞的薄衣、凍得鼻清水點滴不休、還在忍着充時髦、就是凍瘡長得滿身、還是死不改的活受、一般年長的人們、都替她們難過、任你百般的苦勸、那裏灌得進她們的耳朶、我有幾句描寫摩登女子裝束的情形、寫出來請大家指敎指敎、（近稱摩登薄衣單褲、雪地水天、還把膝露、絲襪凉鞋、街頭闊步冷氣侵襲、下體獨多、腰酸腿痛、凍瘡無數、重則絕嗣輕則經錯、）這並不是我説的話太過分、實在太不合國人的衛生、所以要舌敝唇焦的説話、有人説歐洲人先行這種打扮、我們不過模倣模倣、要是有害的話、他們不會不禁止的、這不是中國人和非中國人的關係、是氣候習慣房屋及國人體質等相宜不相宜的問題、因爲歐洲是歐洲的氣候、中國是中國的氣候、歐洲是歐洲人的體質、中國是中國人的體質氣候不同體質各殊、那能够盲從的模倣呢、况且歐洲人的衣服、從小穿的是單薄、就是衣服的增减、也完全是依着室温和氣候的、冷了穿、熱了脱、不把冬夏的季節爲標凖的、中國人的習慣、完全和他們不同、所以夏天發風奇冷的時候也只是一件夏布大褂、冬天穿幾套大毛衣服到人家屋裏、坐在火爐水汀的旁邊也不肯把牠脱了、還有一般所謂摩登的少奶奶小姐們、在家裏倒穿得不少、臨到出門的時候、到反換得單薄、這種理由、眞是寗波人説話缺缺的從前的女人俏一個頭、現代的女人、俏一雙脚、這愛俏的打扮、簡直是弄成寒腿</p>
<p>病的大原因、</p>
<p>寒腿的症狀一看這病名的意思、就知道腿是寒的、緻細的研究牠寒的理由、就是因爲神經受了寒的刺戟、那些血管連忙收縮、從單方面説起來、是可以防止體温放散的好方策、那知道這血管一收縮、流到腿上的血液就减少了、血液一少、温熱也自然减了、營養也自然不充分了、那腿上的神經、因爲寒冷的直接刺戟、發生酸疼麻木、因爲營養障礙的間接關係、於是步履也就不霽甚至不能行了、這神經所受寒冷的刺戟、由脚傳到下腿、由下腿傳到上腿、由上腿傳到腰部、於是受腰部神經支配範圍的生殖器（就是子宮卵巢等的血液循環也起障礙所以起初不過腰酸腿疼、步履不靈後來就要起坐不便、轉動不能、甚至月經不凖、受孕艱難、膀胱酸痛、心胃氣疼、小腹膨脹、尿意淋瀝、到了這個地步、睡眠也不能安了、飲食也不能强了、這病的侵襲、原來是不分男女的、但是内爲女子比男子穿的少、尤其是近來摩登化的裝束、處處要露出她们的曲線美、就是在月經時候和生前産後、也不管身體抵抗的减少、所以實際上女子患病的比男子多、</p>
<p>寒腿的預後在輕度的時候、沒有什麽重大的關係、但是日積月累的厲害了、不但障礙健康、性慾的程度也要减低、在女子方面、月經和生育、自然也要受他的影響、最近我在圏行、遇到一位對於養雞很有研究和經騐的朱漠高亢生、同時去參觀他經營的曙園養雞塲、但是走進園門、四面一看、確不見一只雞的影子、我就問他説道、像這樣太陽十足的時光、爲什麽不把羣雞放出來散散、朱先生説、地下的冰凍還沒有溶解、雞脚踏在冰上、腿部要受寒、産卵的數目、就要减少的、又説還怕牠拾食冰冷的東西、我想一只雞、要牠多生蛋、尙目要如是的保護、你想一個女子、要他多生兒女、可能够這樣的暴露嗎、就是這花草果木的發育、也是地氣温暖的地方繁茂、寒冷的地方、不容易長成、你看花蘭裏的花木、在冬天的時候有的在根部用稻草包着的有的在根部用泥土圍着的、這都是可以證明防禦冷氣下部比上部要緊的證據、現在摩登的裝束、實在是違背科學公理的、三五年來、常常聽見一般十七八廿二三的青年女子、這個説腰酸、那個説腿痛、聽起來到比七八十歲的老婆婆還不如、你想像這樣的下去、這時裝的惡結果、要不了五年十年之後、一定會發生一種腰酸腿痛的流行病、這就是我所調摩登性寒腿病、這個病症、實在有民族强弱的關係、有民族觀念的當軸、應該要終止這不合地方不合體質的時裝我想最好從學校的制褲制鞋入手、一般摩登迷的青年女子、聽了我這議論、或者要説我是一個落伍的宿古董、但是一般有年紀的和已經吃這苦頭的、一定曾點頭贊成的、所以現在不信我的人、在不遠的將來、一定會覺悟起來、我曾經在張家口等邊塞的地方、看見一般種地的老百姓、他們在初度的時候、上半身雖然是光了脊背、但是下半身確還穿着一條棉褲、這樣看來、寒氣從下面來的事實、連無知識的老百姓都知道的、那一般知識階級的青年女子、怎能够這樣的糊塗呢、將來到了不能動不能走的地步、就是後悔也來不及了、（未完）</p>
<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論時下的文字（一）</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>現在，我加入了讀書指導，就是你們的讀者：也可説是你們的朋友？也可説是你們的學生，你們要瞭解我的程度，志趣，和一切的一切······纔對於指導上不會隔膜，虚擲，實際上得到事半功倍的效力，</p>
<p>我在十三歲就離開學校；做人家牛馬般的小學徒自然，文字就和我絕緣了</p>
<p>後來，我自已開了一爿小小雜貨店，這種圈圍式的生活；呆板地看守在櫃台上，一銅元的草紙，二铜元的香烟，三銅元的黃糖，每天就是這樣的做着繁而又碎的工作，</p>
<p>前年，由朋友介紹到上海小工廠裏做司賬，這個文縐縐的長袍，第一次穿在我的身上，好在我珠算精熱工作倒也可以應付，最使我難堪者，文字不够用，尤其是幾個字寫得眞糟，怕煞人，因此，讀書漸漸地爲我聽需要了，</p>
<p>但，想什麽法子來讀書呢？看書嗎？在工作時間拿了一本書，不像樣子，又有碍職務，事實上是不能够的，并且買書也要錢，卽使買來看看，因爲自已沒有選能力也得不到我的興趣，最後，還是在報紙裏去用功夫。報尾巴裏確也可遇到知已，而且，卽使同事們看見，也不妨事。有時，看得好的句子，我就藏起來，</p>
<p>這樣，一年多，報紙碎片積得不少，可是，看起來很麻煩，合我意的，一時又翻不到，因此，又改變方針，訂了一本牛皮紙簿子；只要合我心意的文字，剪下來貼在簿子上，這樣來多麽好啊！看起來又便利，而且都是好文字，</p>
<p>我們的廠裏：本來看新聞報的，所以我不知貴館設立流通圖書館一回事，偶然，到大陸商塲天井裏抬頭四望，看到玻璃窗上幾個金字，引我走進了書館，買了一本目錄，曉得你們一切的手續，因此，我呌送報人也送了申報，加入你們續書指導部，</p>
<p>我不大明瞭現代文字，有的文言中加上（了），（的一，（嗎），等：而白話文中有時又插入文言的詞句，有的白語體文字，每句好像都要打頓，甚至於每個字都格格不得下：有的白話體從頭至尾一口氣可以讀得下，究意那一種是標凖，那一種可做我的典型，（席乃珍來信）</p>

<h3>檢波用眞空管</h3>
<p>— 高崇齡</p>
<p>續前</p>
<p>眞空管檢波所以勝於礦石者，因爲（一）眞空管比礦石靈敏，尋常眞空管的靈敏度約爲礦石的五倍，（二）眞空管的選擇性比礦石佳，（三）檢波眞空管不僅檢波而已，且能將收音擴大，礦石則沒有這樣的能力，（四）檢波眞空管除能把高週率調幅波變爲成音週波外（無綫電話），尙能用以接收高週率連續波（Ｃ·Ｗ·）無綫電報，接收連續波時須檢波管同時兼司振盪作用（例如内差式），或檢波管與另一振盪管並用（例如外差式）；但礦石機則不能接收連續波。</p>
<p>二極管三極管均可用來檢波，但二極管遠不如三極管之靈敏，故司檢波作用的二極管已幾乎全被淘汰。現時通行之檢波管，除三極管外，四極管也並用之。普通所用之三極管爲２０Ｉ·Ａ，２７，３０，３７，５６，ＩＩ９四極管爲２２，２４，Ａ，３２３２，３５，３９３９，５７，　８</p>

<p>眞</p>
<p>空管檢波有兩種：一爲屏檢波，一爲栅檢波（屏栅檢波請參閲本刋第四十六期黃鑑村君之無綫電常識）屏檢波須用負栅接電壓ＧｒｉｄＢｉａｓ）（卽Ｃ電池），以使檢波作用點Ｐ	適在眞空管靜特性曲綫上之下節灣曲處，如第一圖所示，當外來正電壓加到栅極時，屏流的增加比外來負電壓加到栅極時屏流的减少爲多，故整流後之平均屏流爲增加，此電流流入聽筒使鋼膜振動而成音。栅檢波不用栅接電壓，而用一栅電容器與栅漏並聯接於栅極之前，故其檢波作用點Ｐ在靜特性曲線上之</p>
<p>上節灣曲處，如第二圖所示，故整流後之平均屏流爲减少。栅檢波管接收微弱電波比屏檢波管爲更靈敏，故栅檢波管尋常多用之。</p>
<p>多燈收音機的檢波管應設在何階級内，也是一個很重要問題。新式收音機，檢波管多置在强力管（卽最後低週率放大管）之前，換言之，卽置在倒數第二階級内，稱爲强力檢波管（	ＰｏｗｅｒＤｅｔｅｃｔｏｒ），其益處有四：（一）减少檢波所引起的失眞，（二）减少低週率放大管數，因而减少低週率放大管所産生的失眞，（三）减少交流音ｈｕｍ及低週率放大管所起之雜噪音，（四）减輕ｈｕｍ之濾去問題及减低低週率放大之耗費，因而减輕成本。</p>
<h3>放大用眞空管</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>放大是眞空管主要任務之一，檢波前有射電週率放大，檢波後有成音週率放大或中間週率放大，因需要的地位不同，强弱不同，所以雖同爲放大的眞空管，其構造式樣，亦有多種，茲擇最通用的四種，扼要述之。</p>
<p>（一）四極簾栅管（ＳｃｒｅｅｎＧｒｉｄ　Ｔｕｂｅ）三極眞空管，作高週率放大時，因管内屏栅間，有極間電容量存在，屏電能往往藉此回授至栅極，以致産生振盪，不特消失放大作用，且擾亂電波接收，簾栅管的主要優點，卽能免除此弊，其構造在普通三極管的屏栅間，新添一簾栅極，以隔離（Ｓｈｅｉｌｄｉｎｇ）屏栅，使其間電容量，减至極低限度，不能再起回授作用。因簾栅管互導（Ｍｕｔｕａｌ　Ｃｏｎｄｕｃｔａｎｃｅ）極高，故放大能力亦遠勝三極管。如２２２，２２４·等，均屬此類。</p>
<p>（二）變冪簾栅管（Ｖａｒｉａｂｌｅ·Ｍｕ　Ｓｃｒｅｅｎ·Ｇｒｉｄ　Ｔｕｂｅ）表示眞空管放大倍數的名詞，簡稱爲冪（Ｍｕ）變冪就是放倍數可變的意思。此類眞空管的栅極，構造特異，各圈間距離不等，中寛而兩端密，其特性在栅極負電位微弱時，與普通簾栅管一樣放大率極高，但栅負位極大時，電子僅能穿越栅極中間寛疎的極小部份，射向屏極，故屏流變動極小，放大倍數亦低，利用此類眞空管，可使外來電波太强時，放大倍數减低，弱時增高，所以此類眞空管除放大外兼含制音量的作用。如２３５·５５Ｉ·等，均屬此類。</p>
<p>（三）高週率簾栅五極管（Ｓｒｅｅｎ·ＣｒｉｄＲ·Ｆ·Ｐｅｎｔｏｄｅ）此類眞空管，在普通簾栅管四極之外，再加一空間電荷枷（ＳｐａｃｅＣｈａｒｇｅ　Ｇｒｉｄ）處於陰極和栅極之間，其功用可消滅陰極附近的空間電荷，使眞空管互導增高，放大倍數加大。如　五八等，均屬此類。</p>
<p>（四）强力五極管（Ｐｏｗｅｒ　Ｐｅｎｔｏｄｅ）要使收音機音量宏大，成音週率末級放大管，必需放大倍數極高，且能輪出强大不失眞電力者；强力五極管，應此而生，其構造又與前者不同，第五極稱爲陰栅（Ｃａｔｈｏｄｅ　Ｇｒｉｄ）七鎭壓栅（ＳｕｐｐｒｅｓｓｏｒＧｒｉｄ）在管内與陰極或絲極相連，故電位爲零，其地位處於屏極和簾栅極間。屏極吸引的電子，進行速率極高，抵屏極時，往往將屏極的電子撞霰　，此撞散的游離電子，經隣近簾栅極的强力吸引，疾向簾栅逆行，稱爲回射（ＳｃｏｎｄａｒｙＥｍｉｓｓｉｏｎ）以致屏流驟减，眞空管不能作直綫放大，容易失眞，陰極的功用，卽能拒斥此回射的電子，使仍歸屏極。强力五極管，靈敏度極高，雖極低的輪入信號電壓，亦能得强力的輪出，故採用此管，成音週率放大，僅需一級，已足有餘，經濟殊甚，目下收音機的輪出管，幾無有不用此式者，其效用蓋可想見。如２４７·２３８等，均　此類。</p>

<h3>傀儡戲</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>我們氣不過溥儀，在小做小朝廷天子，便稱他傀儡，他所作所爲，當然是傀儡戲了。傀儡戲上海人稱提綫戲，蘇州人稱木人頭戲，總而言之，統而言之聽人指揮，不由自主，比喻是最確切沒有了，在唯物論夙行的今日，這些象徵派的玩意兒，已不當令，所以傀儡戲，已成落伍。只有歲尾年頭，那些江北人，背了一架小戲台，到街頭巷口，自打鑼鼓，自串自唱，募幾十個子兒餬口，還引得到兒童們的欣賞呢。</p>
<p>宋韓怩肯看傀儡，令包道成作詩云：（一人頭上又安人，脚踏空虚舞弄春，莫敎綫斷兒童乎，骨肉都爲陌路盛。）這一節話見於宋俞文豹的吹劍錄，他還加着按語云：（韓公末路如此詩。）論詩自然是打油，打油總是主文譎諫的，不過做傀儡的，是個不知不覺者，儘是諷刺，漠然無動，况且卽做了傀儡，一入人手，還容得你掙扎别扭麽。</p>
<p>人是有知有覺的，自然不肯做傀儡的，但是是往往有名義上很崇高，而實際上一無權力，足以行使，任人擺布，這個苦處，向那裏説起。我照中國的傀儡正多着，單就政治舞臺説，已指不勝屈，那提綫人各色俱全，有的是外國人，有的是中國人，中國人裏面還有自已家裏人和别的家裏人之分。提綫的藝術最巧妙者，莫過於（太太），從前衙門裏有三爺，師爺，二爺，少爺，有時加上舅爺，現在陰性當行出色，三爺歸於一（太）。凡是太太，沒有一位不擅長提綫的，倘然不止一（太），其爲傀儡丈夫也，更是可憐。</p>
<p>就是照溥儀，已經備受各種提線者播弄，説不定要合着包道成所料了。三月一日還要串一齣新鮮話巴戲，給全世界的觀衆賞鑒一番，滿洲成了第二朝鮮，離不成陌中之塵，也無異褏中之龜了。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别淚</p>
<p>挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>趙翁坐在上面，心裏可就想着，怪不得這孩子這樣子的快樂，以爲不久，就要到遷安去聚首的，説起來呢，可也就是可憐。心裏如此想着，眼睛朝下望，果然見他還是笑嘻嘻的。又轉念一想，他旣是這樣高興，樂得大家糊裏糊塗吃喝一陣子，你何必替别人擔憂？於是也逗引着江氏，一同吃喝起來趙自强左手拿着餡兒餅，右手端了酒杯，在鮮脆脆鹹的餅味當中，酒乃是不可缺少的一種東西，喝得爽口，只管跟着喝了下去。待肚子裏吃飽了的時候，酒也喝得有七成醉了。於是手按桌沿，站將起來，幌盪了兩下，笑着搖搖頭道：够了，别眞喝醉了。他説着話向屋子裏走，只見桌上擺了兩隻碟子，一碟子盛着蘋果，一碟子，盛着香蕉。回頭見桂枝跟了進來，笑道：你眞會辦事，料着我會喝醉，先預備下這個和我解酒。可是我</p>
<p>想吃兩片梨，才爽口呢。桂枝笑道：咱們不離。自强手扶了桌子，笑道：酒眞够了，什麽時候了？抬頭一看桌上那一架座鐘，却已不見。問道：我們的鐘呢？桂枝笑道：今天晚上，咱們用不着那東西，而且也討厭那東西。我收起了。自强聽了這話，不由得心口裏蕩漾了兩下，沒有作聲，拿了一個蘋果在手上，在口袋裏掏出小刀子來，慢慢削着皮。桂枝站在他面前，向他眼皮一撩道：對了，吃個蘋果罷。吃了之後，一路平平安安的。自强笑道；你的話説得很好，吃了蘋果就平平安安的。那麽，吃了香蕉又討個什麽兆頭呢？（三一四）</p>
<h3>王省三軼事</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>王省三，略歷已詳各報，愚復憶一二佚事，述之如后：</p>
<p>省三，初館於庽滬歙縣唐昆華（名光照）家，時唐由部曹出守江寗，嗣以秉性伉直，爲忌者所中傷，遂掛冠歸，得延王爲西席，敎其子德藻得鰲，及女靜芳，未幾，以館穀甚菲，而不耐枯坐，恒夜出習橫行蟹字，稍進，旋拂衣而去，唐固留之，不顧也。清光緒已丑遊歐西，迨乙未回國，至辛丑，復渡扶桑，壬寅補行庚子辛丑恩正兩科，納監入闈，名列經魁，其座師爲廣東南海丙子進士戴鴻慈，與湖南湘潭王均隆，中式者皆一時之俊秀，如上海朱壽朋，汪鍚增，黃肇蘭，黃炎培，謝永炘，而知名者，又有儀徵劉師培，歙縣徐謙，表浦金詠榴。唯無錫王藴章，（西神）屆列副榜，王作（宋神宗置太學三舍，厥後陳東率諸生伏闕上書請李網，卽出自太學論，）後有（氣節根於天性，不　恃學養），故雖以太學三舍之縱橫凌雜，而此皎皎者，終不得而污，此錚錚者，終不得而屈，卽謂五十七年間，僅養此一士可也，卽謂此一士，足以蔽太學諸生可也）。次（唐楊綰疏停明經進士，請令州縣舉季廉論），中有（取士者，要黨求其實行，不采虚聲，庶所得之人才，心術無不靖，學術無不正，小足爲天下國家之用，而大足以用天下國家。）衡鑑堂評爲（主葉氏水心説，深切著明，於敎育宗旨；甚有關係。而扶撥流弊，尤推重於學校云云。時廢制義，初改策論，字裏行間，精心結撰，非尋常數墨家可比，其興學之意，不俟大西路之光華黌舍區立，而懷抱之閎願，已植於斯時已。</p>
<p>當歐遊回，家固在城中，其考亦素寒微，所居湫隘，恒終歲不入城，謂此狗竇耳，故晨昏定省，實闕如焉。後在淛水在交涉事，頗著政績，回滬，復以地産所獲，雄於貲，而暮年常爲家人窘，老而以多財取苦，亦罕聞也。</p>
<h3>歲暮歲首</h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>我們照國歷算來，現在已過新年了。但是照相沿成習的舊習慣看來，正在新年咧！</p>
<p>年關當然是一年最緊要的時期，也是人欠欠人結束的當兒，作一次大規模的舉動，所以一到了舊歷年底，個個憂形於色，十分爲難，不差！平日比較舒服慣的，無論衣食等費，都向店家暫欠，爲了自已信用的不錯，人家也很樂於應付，但是一到年關，僨臺高築，無處可避的當兒，不得不一走以了之，一屁股的債，拍拍手就走了，害得人家也無可奈何。</p>
<p>本來有句成語，是（無債一身輕，）平日比較能咬些菜根，到了歲暮，也許沒有什麽問題發生。若然能抱定量入爲出的標凖，也許不至於弄得焦頭爛額，一籌莫展。所以古人説得好；宜未雨而綢繆，勿臨渴而掘井。）這兩句話，可以向那些到了年關滿身是債的人，作一番忠告，也可以説是當頭棒喝咧！</p>
<p>但是説雖然這樣説，那一個人不是見了棺材哭的嗎？我曾見我的家鄉有一位公子哥兒，平日靠了祖上的餘威，東去欠，西去賒，到了年關，人家急得要死，他好整以暇，一個人躱在家中，圍爐閒坐，賞雪品梅，多麽雅人深致呀！</p>
<p>一到新年，他又出現了，依舊束欠西賒，沒有一個人敢爲難了他，這豈不是一件好頑的事嗎？</p>
<p>歲暮了，好整以暇以的人們，又要等候歲首快來，了却一身的債呢？</p>
<h3>拉雜話梅花片片</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>歲寒三友中，惟一樹梅花，最爲嫵媚，梅爲落葉喬木，早者冬至前卽開，晚者春分時始放，若栽植多株，則可以次第繁榮，相續不斷，厥色或紅或白，在含苞初坼之際，紅者似點點胭脂，白者微暈嫩碧，遂有綠惎華之稱，而百年老幹，其枝拳曲糾蟠，蒼蘇鱗皴，花生滿樹，且有苗鬚，垂於枝間，長寸許，風至綠絲飄動，其蔭霞靄，可羅坐數十人，好事者載酒賞之，尤具雅致。</p>
<p>我友賀天健君，嘗評産梅之地，謂排列如豆瓜，無錫梅園之梅也，枯秃如老桑，蘇州鄧尉之梅也，歌瘦如剥皮松，江寗龍蟠之梅也，攢處交錯如荆榛，杭州孤山之梅也，放曠高鶱如散人，江西大庚之梅也，又云，梅宜靜觀之，更宜於山深林密中觀之，語絕雋妙，是眞讖花有眼者。</p>
<p>彭雪琴誓畫十萬梅花，士林傳爲韻事，旣歸道山，湘綺老人輓以聯云：（詩酒自名家，看勳業爛然，長增畫苑梅花色，樓船欲橫海，歎英雄老矣，忍説江南血戰功，）哀感豪邁，一時傳誦焉。</p>
<p>仙家清代供：將梅之落凈洗，用雪水煎，候白粥熟同煮，名梅花粥，食品清雅如許，彼羊羔美酒輩，豈知有此味者。</p>
<p>清高宗朝，和珅當國，有某太史者，欲得和相歡心，曲事其左右，旣而恃才傲物，對於舊所援引之人，不復在其心目，左右咸不悦之，時又有與之爭寵者，見某太史所呈和相梅花詩，有相公嫵媚等語，因謂此蓋諷刺相國者，意在譏相國附諛順旨也，按此詩係相府有梅一樹，春日盛開，招諸翰林之在門下者，飲酒賦詩，某太史獨有嫵媚一語，他翰林雖有用宋廣平典作諛頌者，顧嫵媚二字咸避而不用可謂黠矣。太史因是謫官，第讀宋劉潛夫句云：（却被梅花累十年），因笑曰：劉公被抑於史彌遠，與余將毌同。</p>
<p>武進湯雨生都督，客居白門，築琴隱園於雞籠山下，風流文采，三絕才名，照耀一時，有畫梅樓爲其德配雙湖夫人畫梅處，夫人嘗畫梅，寄雨生於九江，附題一詞云：（折得嶺南梅，憶著江雪，君到江南正雪天，未是梅花節，畫了一枝成，沒個人評説，抵得家書寄與看，瘦到珊珊骨），雨生家一門風雅，夫人女公子皆能吟詠，善畫工琴，諸公子亦王謝風流，絕無俗韻也。</p>
<p>楊雲史佐吳孚威戎幕，素有才子之目，於漢上識校書陳美美，備極繾綣，雲史固擅丹青，遂擘金箋，調紅脂，繪梅花四幀，有枝頭交頸，花底同心之致，并媵八絕，其警句如自是上陽高格調，一生悲喜爲梅花，又近來英氣消磨盡，只畫梅花贈美人，非名士風情，曷克臻此。</p>
<p>山栗橄欖薄切同食，有梅花香，古人稱之爲梅花脯。</p>
<p>游梅花勝地，而非其時，最爲可憾，予曩年與石予師至無錫梅園，時爲孟冬，梅未蓓蕾，然天寒氣肅，忽而降雪，霏霏不已，石予師遂有多感天公忙點綴，滿山飛雪代梅花之句，我友枕亞游湖過時，抵孤山未見癯仙踪影，亦有詩云：芳時已客停車，來訪孤山處士家，底事行遲二三月，料無清福對梅花。</p>

<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 張承祿</p>
<p>今年上海的遇舊年，比去年熱凍鬧。</p>
<p>文字上和口頭上的稱呼，往往有些不同：或者謂之（廢歷），輕之也；或者謂之（古歷），愛之也。但對於這（歷）的待遇是一樣的：結賬，祀神，祭祖，放鞭砲，打馬將，拜年，（恭喜發財）！</p>
<p>雖過年而不停刋的報章上，也已經有了感慨；但是，感慨而已，到底勝不過事實。有些英雄的作家，也曾經呌人終年奮發，悲憤，紀念。但是，呌而已矣，到底也勝不過事實。中國的可哀的紀念太多了，這照例至少應該沈默；可喜的紀念也不算少，然而又怕有人（乘機搗亂），所以大家的高興也不能發揚。幾經防遏，幾經淘汰，什麽佳節都被絞死，於是就覺得只有這僅存殘喘的（廢歷）或（古歷）還是自家的東西，更加可愛了。那就格外的慶賀！這是不能以（封建的餘意）一句話，輕輕了事的。</p>
<p>呌人整年的悲憤，勞作的英雄們，一定是自已毫不知道悲憤，勞作的人物。在實際上，悲憤者和勞作者，是時時需要休息和高興的。</p>
<p>我不過舊歷年已經二十三年了，這回却連放了三夜的花爆，使隔壁的外國人也（嘘）了起來：這却和花爆都成了我一年中僅有的高興。</p>
<h3>一九三四年的前奏曲</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>一九三四年的第一個月是這樣在我底眼前匆匆溜過了！每天我都想寫一點什麽東西，留下這一個月來生活的痕跡，但是不知爲什麽老是提不起寫文章的興趣來，偶然被良心責備得太苦痛了，恨恨地走進房來關上門伏在桌上寫字，但不是在日記上亂畫，便是拿着書本呆看，文章仍然寫不出來。</p>
<p>的確，文章材料實在太多了，但是我寫不出一個字。</p>
<p>我不敢重讀特的來信，他是希望我努力創作的，我更不敢想到幾位好友對我的期望||期望我在今年多寫些有力的作品，要勝過過去的一切。</p>
<p>今天，更大的難關臨頭了！</p>
<p>三嫂自從我回來後，她便希望我在暫時不愁飯吃的安靜環境裏多寫點東西，但我總是騙着她：不是説頭暈便是説肚子痛，或者耳朶響。她是很愛我的，一聽到我有點毛病，便要陪我去醫院；天！我最怕吃藥！那裏肯去呢？只好連忙説：（好了，好了，現在不痛了。）</p>
<p>（不痛了，休息一下寫文章去。）</p>
<p>這道哀的美敦書，不知她下過幾多次了。</p>
<p>今早在床上，她就對我説：（今天要表哥替你買個火盆來燒點白炭到你的房裏去寫文章，熱水瓶也拿去，不要老是和我玩。）</p>
<p>（對了，我也正這樣想呢，一天一天的過去，連我自已都懶得不好意思了）</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>説這句話，我的臉是紅紅的||我感覺到。</p>
<p>不幸她的病還沒有好，我的肚子又痛得厲害起來了，於是整個的上午消磨在醫院。</p>
<p>午飯後我在畫枕頭花，三嫂連忙搶去了我的筆，帶着嚴重而微笑的神氣對我説：（我來畫，畫好了替你做，你不要管這事，趕快寫文章去吧，火盆已經燒好了。）</p>
<p>她一面坐上了我的椅子，一面呌劉嫂移火盆進我的房裏去，沒法，我只好苦笑着去了。</p>
<p>（你一天可寫多少字？妹妹·）</p>
<p>當我走進她的臥房拿水筆時，她這樣問我。</p>
<p>（哼！不寫則已，一寫起碼一萬，）我故意很驕傲地回答她，其實根據過去的經騐，我一天寫過一萬二千多。</p>
<p>（喝，了不得！那麽就打個對折吧，每天我只要你交我五千。）她笑了。</p>
<p>（好的，不過今天是開始，减少一點吧，我只寫一千。）我像對待商人似的和她講價。</p>
<p>（不，非兩千不可，沒寫起，不准你來我這邊，也沒有飯給你吃。）</p>
<p>（我偏祇寫一千，看你眞的不給飯我吃不。）</p>
<p>説來慚愧，人雖然快到中年了，但心情還是和孩子一般，也許是（沒出息）的徵象吧？我老是這樣過着孩子般的生活。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>坐下來，炭盆裏的白炭正發出熊熊的火光，我想如果再不寫幾行字，不但辜負了三嫂的好意，連表哥和劉嫂都對不住呢。</p>
<p>筆雖然拿在手裏了，稿紙也擺好了，但我一心一意想寫一封長信給垢，因爲亞的兩封掛號信正放在我的桌上引誘我。</p>
<p>||不要這樣偷懶，振作起精神來寫好了文章再回信不好嗎？</p>
<p>良心的譴責，比任何人的刺激都來得厲害。</p>
<p>沉默了好幾分鐘，仍然寫不出什麽，我知道這原因是爲了一月來的生活太不安定了，每天都在浪濤般的環境裏生活着，一切都被壓得緊緊的，呼吸到的盡是黑的烟，白的霧。</p>
<p>||你也太不中用了，難道你就不能創造新的環境嗎？生活愈不安定，愈要努力創作，環境愈是惡劣，你愈要努力奮鬥！</p>
<p>不錯，我始終保持着我的信念，就這樣對着火盆發誓吧，我的心永遠是紅的，血永遠是熱的，意志永遠是堅强的！雖然是大雪紛飛的冬天，但我仍然要在冰冷的氣候裏前進！無論如何，我要完成朋友希望我寫的那部東西！</p>
<h3>籧廬詩話</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>予不能爲詩，頗好談詩。偶有所感，亦託吟咏。儕輩或相譏侮，予爲誦一詩云：</p>
<p>文人自命便無用，此論未公吾不憑。</p>
<p>五代若非詞世界，一般相斫更堪憎。</p>
<p>此蔡孑民先生題徐仲可純飛館塡詞圖也。聞者爽然。予更爲誦一詩云：</p>
<p>愛酒何妨盡酒錢？一朝快活敵千年。</p>
<p>憑陵大呌歌今夕，不到天明未肯眠。</p>
<p>此予七年前金陵旅舍除夕大醉題壁之一也。一友更嗤之，以爲太俗，予微哂之，姑以白話詩爲解。友復蘋顔爭曰，旣用舊體，卽宜語有出處。予曰，四句已有三出處矣，顧以爲少耶？友曰，一朝快活敵千年，實不成語。予因謂此出北齊書和土開傳。和士開嘗説世祖云，自古帝王，盡爲灰燼，堯舜桀紂，竟復何異？宜及少壯，恣意行樂，縱橫行之，卽是一日快活敵千年，無爲自勤苦也</p>
<p>頃者舊歷除夕復屆，賤狀猶昔。昨赴潤泉兄處喫年夜飯，偶然興奮，連飲黃酒三盃，今晨如厠，下血可怖，豪氣又减當年在金陸時矣。予於晚清詩人獨推江弢叔，因憶其歲除日戲作云：�</p>
<p>庭角無梅座不春，門扉雖闔豈遮貧。</p>
<p>晚來雪屐鳴深巷，半是吾家索債人。</p>
<p>有人來算屋租錢，小住三間月二千。</p>
<p>使屋如船撑得動，避喧應到太湖邊。</p>
<p>此等詩眞可謂之（窮開心）。予境與弢�</p>
<p>叔差似，而苦憤彌深，其爲賢不肖，豈不判然也乎！樊樊山已已除夕詩云：</p>
<p>二千餘載到今天，不許人過舊歷年。</p>
<p>可得不爲寒士計，秀才無分賣春聯！</p>
<p>予今爲下一轉語曰，卽使舊歷不廢，而民力疲，救死不贍，雖落筆如飛，春聯萬幅，又何所用之哉！</p>
<h3>另一種鐵窗風味</h3>
<p>— 林希雋</p>
<p>抱了一大包累贅的東西，在那麽僻靜的夜街上走着。使得每一個有過這經騐的路人本能地連想到那一回事上去。當人們以那似帶着考問而又含着卑視的意味的眼睛！緊緊地注射着我户膊下的東</p>
<p>西，並一直移向我的臉孔的時候，心頭就不由自主的蹩扭起來，同時感到一種被侮拿了似的憤怒，於是我也不示弱地立刻怒視着對方。</p>
<p>走近了門上掛着一塊金字木版的店舖子，就不禁想起裏邊一些無情的鐵板一般的臉孔，全身的熱氣猛的冷了下來，腿子也顯得格外不對勁，好像給什麽東西絆住了似地。但是骨碌碌在打鼓似的肚子，越響的有勁，就是要忍耐也不可能，只得竭力掙起勇氣跑進去。</p>
<p>瞧着已經有好幾個人站在鐵栅外面，想着吃這苦味兒的並不只咱一個人，慌亂的情緒忽然下意識地平靜了。可是鐵栅裏的權威者一眼瞥見我那包累贅的東西，不能由鐵縫空兒拿進去時，便縐了眉，現出挺不願意而又厭煩地開了旁邊的小鐵門，高聲叱着：</p>
<p>（拿上來），隨後又來了一個非常鄙篾的眼光。</p>
<p>捺住一口差不多發作出來的惡氣，無言地把東西讓他接了過去。</p>
<p>鎖了門，在燈光下打開了紙包，我正預備説：（五塊錢），你猜他怎麽？從鼻腔裏（嗤）的嘘了一聲，連看都不看，冷笑道：（不要這種蹩脚貨色）。</p>
<p>像一顆炸彈在身邊爆發起來，我的腦袋幾乎脹得發昏，連忙輕聲説：（仔細瞧瞧吧！隨便換兩三塊錢總是可以的）。説出這話是用了極大的氣力，口吻是近乎懇求的。</p>
<p>（哼，啥話，犯着看，這些貨色根本要不得，拿回去）。</p>
<p>話是從高高地站在鐵栅裏邊的人説出來的，而聽這話的可有如聆到判刑的囚徒，抖縮在外邊。</p>
<p>再痛苦地望望鐵板的臉孔，看有沒有通融的餘地。然而那樣堅决的拒絕的回答，和那難堪的表情，不是分明告訴我别妄想了嗎？</p>
<p>一種不可説的忿恨襲擊着我，怒火馬上冒穿腦蓋，我幾乎想拖出那傢伙來揍他幾下，出出氣。然而粗大的鐵栅多傲慢地橫在眼前，把外裏分成了兩個世界。我祗好深長地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>馱着失望的苦楚，走了出來。額頂不停他冒着汗顆子。週身的氣力也不知沉深到什麽地方去了。只顧跨着沒勁兒的脚步茫茫然地走着。</p>
<p>一路走去，經過幾處掛着同樣金牌子的舖子，我都祗在門外徘徊着，想進去又不敢進去，而且腦際還閃現着那一面鐵板的獰笑的臉孔。我的心就被冰塊蓋着似的冷了一陣，再也鼓不起勇氣來。</p>
<p>只痛楚地咬緊牙根，第四次離開了有金牌子的門口</p>
<p>可是整天未曾下過一口飯的空腹喊得更凄凉可聞，我伸手摸着袋子，結果祗搜出僅剩下的六個銅子，便是嚼燒餅也不能飽啦。</p>
<p>（五塊錢），不能忍耐的飢餓驅使我不管一切地重行出現於鐵栅前。</p>
<p>惶恐地待着回聲。權威者照例把東西朝燈光下估量了一遍，一遍······最後望了望我，才出於意外的道：（只能值三塊錢，要不）？</p>
<p>（好的）不加思索的趕忙答應了。</p>
<p>把肚子裝飽之後，精神也就振作了許多，帶着酒後的薄醉在回家的夜路上彳亍着，夜街是沉深的，十二月的風是刺人的，十字街口半空的紅綠燈疲倦地散佈着糢湖的幻夢，和我那沒着落的心境一樣。肚子已不再嚕囌嚷着，便夢似的哼着流浪者小調，慢慢的走着，狠想暫時忘掉了一切的思念，可是終於撇不了那傲慢的鐵栅，以及那鐵栅内的冷冰的無情的臉孔············</p>
<h3>我詛咒你那麽一笑（四）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>（過得兒果，過得兒果，過得······）。</p>
<p>同時，又把右手往屁股上一摸，仍然用手指做個圓圈圈現了出來。</p>
<p>（雞蛋呀！雞蛋呀！）</p>
<p>大家哄地一聲，嘩啦嘩啦地大笑着。</p>
<p>端着竹筐子，正悶着氣的人呢，也笑得洋山芋倒了出來，骨碌碌地遍地都滚去了，她的小弟弟和妹妹，就快快活活地趕着去捉拿。</p>
<p>老板娘眼淚也笑了出來，一面呌着。</p>
<p>（天呀，天呀。）</p>
<p>一天到晚都躺在床上吹烟的老板，這個國王呢，也笑得從寳座上坐了起來，很有精神地喊着</p>
<p>（記着呀，你們記着呀！······呀，剛才説找是（雞母）嗎？）</p>
<p>連自已也記不太清了，却還在正經地吩咐人家，便小了聲音，改正道：</p>
<p>（該是（雞烏）吧？）</p>
<p>一面抓抓自已的頭皮。</p>
<p>（雞母·········雞公嘞！）</p>
<p>正高興着的老板娘，就回頭打趣老板來了。</p>
<p>（你······哼，你多懂得喃！······人家買芒果嘞！）</p>
<p>老板偏一偏頸子眯小眼睛，也高興地打趣過去。</p>
<p>這事以後，小孩子們一看見這位印度人走來，便遠遠地站着，笑嘻嘻地喊過得果了。有時還故意蹲在地上，拍着兩手，學他前次下蛋的樣子。這位被呌做過得果的印度人呢，就只有不好意思地，難爲情地笑着。</p>
<p>後來，他偶然知道我是懂得一點子英語的，便在買東西的時候，就呌我來解决他的難關。</p>
<p>比如他一進店門，就喊着：</p>
<p>（姐馬！姐馬！）</p>
<p>馬上覺得不生効，便趕忙找着我喊。</p>
<p>（Ｈｅｎ！ｅｎＨ）</p>
<p>經了我的説明，才把緬甸話的（姐馬）和中國話的（雞母）連繫起來，而他要的東西，也就毫不費力地得到手了。</p>
<p>因此，一有關於外交上的事情，他總要來拜訪我這位掃馬糞的夥計的。而我也有時要跑到他那裏去借點書來看；像緬甸神話印度故事那一類的英文小册子，他是藏有好些的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>班禪贈政府大羊頭</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>日昨（七日）報載：（班禪此次入京，携來西藏羊頭一頭，恭贈政府······）云云一則，雖然報上曾用錦上添花似的妙筆，把牠描寫成眞像所謂（誠屬希有）之珍，而政府也好像受之有愧，却之不恭；似的，特一派員送往中央研究院歷史博物館陳列）。但是以一般普通人看起來，尤其猪羊成羣的牧畜家看起來，（羊頭）到底是（羊頭），而且是一只（宰已一月）的（死羊頭）！值此新春歲首，萬事皆取吉慶的時候，怎麽會好把（死羊頭）來作贈品？而且贈禮者是（班禪國師），受贈者是（國民政府），不僅要呌人連呼怪哉奇也，並且還要呌人疑神疑鬼地猜度牠的奥妙！這是難免的事！</p>
<p>其實，此一（大羊頭）之贈也，所含意義，恐怕還比買三大公司最貴最貴的禮劵，還要强幾千百倍！我們（至少我個人）試胡亂地想想吧：</p>
<p>（羊）者，（祥）也。古祥字原作羊，故今人若寫吉慶字，尤其題古玩花瓶和壽屏喜禮一類的東西，在寫了（富貴壽考）之後，一定忘不了（大吉羊）三字。凖此作解，今班禪贈我政府以（大羊頭），卽癮含有（大吉大祥之國運，將從今始）。所云（今始），卽（頭）字之謂。該羊頭（大如笆斗，三倍於内地之羊），足見一羊可抵（三羊）。提到（三羊），以國人素來談吉不談凶的鋭敏腦筋，自然更能聯想到（開泰）二字|此贈大羊頭之|大意義！</p>
<p>西藏問題，自民元以來，因有英國勢力之由印度長伸直入，隱然已另形成一政治系統，近年藏軍且不受命，屢寇川康，英人積極圖謀開發此世界之謎的（西藏秘密國）的呼聲，亦隨之日益加高。正苦無法應付之際，西藏政敎大領袖之一的達賴，忽然圓寂，而其他一大領袖卽班禪，是斜披袈裟有如肉袒的班禪，忽由西藏斫（大羊頭）以獻國府，揆以（鄭伯肉袒牽羊逆）之例，於此可兆，藏局無論任何變化，其必永久歸順於我，無貳於國，終歸是金甌無恙的|此贈大羊頭之二大意義！</p>
<p>自九一八事變爆發，東北被人生呑剥地抓了去，上上下下的國人，當無不憤恨痛惜！但是儘管憤恨痛惜，而不思有以補救之，究有何用？何况現在邊疆問題，例如内蒙自治，南疆宣佈獨立，康藏糾紛迄未澈底解决等等，在在都需要政府予以極度注意和補救的必要，可是究有誰能予以這樣有力的警告呢？</p>
<p>好了！現在有一只西藏大羊頭，由政府陳列歷史博物館裏，睹物思情，自然會想到邊疆問題的急應（亡羊補牢）！此贈大羊頭的三大意義！</p>
<p>此外還有羊頭只可陳列，切不可掛起去賣狗肉；看見已在京都陳列着的大羊頭，便應聯想到還遠在邊疆的大肥羊肉等等儆意，然要皆在人之能善自思之，始可窺此大羊頭之洋洋大觀也！</p>
<p>投李報桃，禮尙往來。班禪離藏，已及十年，新值達賴圓寂，當有懷鄉之感。政府旣收受了他老人家的禮品，其將有以報之耶？</p>
<h3>錯轉念頭</h3>
<p>— 述古</p>
<p>在現在這個畸形社會裏，一切光怪墜離的新花樣，無不應有皆有，連一向被人認爲最神秘的生殖器，居然也遭遇着空前未有的厄運，如果借用一下先生新創（？）的術語，眞大有（閹潮）之趨勢。</p>
<p>日昨報載蘇州有周某其人者，因爲自已被女兒浪漫特甚，亂姘而至六七人之多，傷風敗俗，有玷家聲，憤而自去其勢。就表面看去，這之間，倒頗含有若干幽默性。</p>
<p>還記得前些時候，德國一個老年工人雞姦幼童，被法院判處徒刑一年，不已，且施以宮刑。雖然我們感覺這有些太背人道，然而就事論事，終不能不説一聲，：（罪有應得）。</p>
<p>若夫這位周君的這番苦心，也不難推求而得知的：他以其女兒的那么（妄作非爲），實是由於家庭敎育不良，自已管理不嚴，歸根結蒂，還是只怪自已（罪孼深重），於是引咎去勢，以明責任。這種反躬自省的精神，眞值得五體投地地敬佩的，推而反之，假使咱们中國個個能如此，一切可無問題，不在話下</p>
<p>可是如果將這個問題的因果關係，透視地剖解一番，咎固不在周君，卽其女兒的本身，亦毌足深怪。當此人慾橫流的時候，一般涉世未久的青年女子，一方面受着本能的衝動與物質的引誘，同時更有惡劣的環境，張開着血口窺伺其旁，自然很容易心不由主地陷溺進去，這是現實社會現階段中的必然現象。每日報端社會新聞的篇幅，就多着這類血腥事實的紀載呢。</p>
<p>其次還有一點值得吾人注意的：在周君去勢以後，他的浪漫女兒，究否因</p>
<p>而大受感動，一時三刻改邪務正，重返良家女子之路，誰也不敢肯定。如果她的故態依舊不改，周君終於平白地犧牲了自已的（飲食男女）的終身幸福，且也不免有些（自慚形穢）。雖然有一個德國的老年工人，在搖爲之同情，雖然他日見司馬遷於九泉的時候，可以博得一聲（同志）的盛名，其他却找不出半點兒代價了。</p>
<p>周君因爲自已的意識模糊，把握不住，（這是誰的責任）的問題，錯轉了一個念頭，於是此愚笨的去勢的下策，豈不大可哀也乎？</p>
<h3>世上最痛苦的人</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>在這時代的尖端，誰不是這樣的嚷着：</p>
<p>（人生的痛苦，人生的痛苦呀！）</p>
<p>是的人生是痛苦的！這並不是一般人無聊的呐喊，也不是神經過敏的夢囈。生活决定了人類的意義，人，是痛苦的。多少大哲學家文學家都曾運用着縝密的觀察，寫定了人生的這一頁，替代着萬萬千千的大衆，早已呌出了這麽一聲：（人生是痛苦的呵！）</p>
<p>然而我們認爲有些異議。</p>
<p>粗粗的看來，人生固然是痛苦，而且是每個每個都有這麽一份兒。可是這未免太籠統了，也未免太把全人類包括得乾凈了。據我看，人生的味兒，雖不如樂天派那般的值得歌頌，美滿，快樂。然而所謂痛苦也决不是每個人都是一樣。</p>
<p>一，有一部分下等的人，他們本來是很可以做一番事情的，可是因爲社會不良，無法謀生，他們就索性袖手閒逛起來，滿口四不像的調調兒，夜飯米就全靠牌賭，叩竹槓，他們欺侮不了大人物，就專門向土老百姓的身上，找生活，這類的人在上海眞多着呢，街頭巷尾幾乎全是他們的勢力，所過的人生，是苟且的，是偷活的，也是種最痛苦的人。</p>
<p>一，娼妓和侍役，在生活上，她們儼然是優裕的份子，但精神實在痛苦無比。我們不要以爲娼妓的賣淫是種雙關愜意的事情，實際上她們幾多是在雙淚暗灑中接客，以討得幾個臭錢活命養家。侍役滿面風情的招待賓主，又何嘗不像摇搖尾的獅子狗。這輩人，所過的生活也是最痛苦不過了。</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying Sends Representatives to Peiping, Expressing Willingness to Leave the Army Immediately</h3>
<p>Troops to be Controlled by Military Council</p>
<p>Wartime Situation at Ningxia Front Relaxes</p>
<p>Relieving Troops Take Over Defense of Wuyuan and Linhe</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang Arrive in Peiping Yesterday</p>
<p>Visit He Yingqin to Discuss Military Plans</p>
<p>Decision Made to Issue Final Admonition to Sun</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to observations by a certain military expert, if Sun's troops are subjected to pressure, they will inevitably flee south towards Gansu and Shaanxi, planning to join forces with the remnants of the bandit Xu. Seeing that the situation is turning against him, Sun sent Deputy Commander Jin Zunhua from the front lines to Peiping this morning to meet with the authorities to make requests and negotiate the incorporation of Yu Shiming's troops. After getting off the train, Jin visited Hu Jiesan, and then they went together to visit the relevant authorities to negotiate. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Jin Zunhua arrived in Peiping this morning and immediately met with He to report that Sun had resolved to leave the army and requested the freedom to reside in Taiyuan or Peiping and Tianjin. Jin stated that Sun had resolved to leave the army after receiving the dismissal order but had been unable to do so due to various difficulties. He plans to reside in Taiyuan or Peiping and Tianjin in the future, with his troops to be controlled by the Military Council. He had been summoned by He and met with Sun before leaving. Sun is currently in Shizuizi. The situation at the front is no longer very intense. The defense of Wuyuan and Linhe in western Sui is now being taken over by Shanxi troops. He will return to the front after this matter is completed. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Sun's troops have not yet ceased military actions. Recently, Yu Shiming and Shi Wenhua have been contacted about surrendering. The Shanxi-Sui troops are dispatching two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, two artillery battalions, and one independent regiment, which should be fully assembled around the 20th, preparing to cut off Sun's rear. Recently, advance units have concentrated in Linhe, with rear units in Shuoxian. Fu Zuoyi is taking full responsibility for the command. (16th Dispatch) (Peiping) Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang arrived in Peiping at 2:00 PM this afternoon and consulted with the authorities on how to encircle and suppress Sun's troops. Fu stated that Yan's views on resolving Sun's situation were consistent with those of the Peiping Branch and that it had been decided to order the Shanxi and Sui provinces to dispatch three divisions and one independent brigade, with him taking military responsibility. The various units have already gathered in Wuyuan and Linhe. How to encircle and suppress will be decided after meeting with He tonight. He will stay in Peiping for three or four days and then go to Baotou to direct military operations. Xu stated that the Shanxi army takes the protection of the people's interests as a prerequisite for suppressing Sun. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Sun's troops continued to attack Ningyuan, but due to heavy blows from Ma's troops and bombing by aircraft, casualties were too heavy, and they have not attacked the city since the 11th. Ma's troops are now closely monitoring the situation and preparing to attack. According to a telegram from Ningyuan, Sun himself has arrived in Mandaqiao and has been holding emergency meetings with officers above the rank of regimental commander for several days, planning to attack the city again. He is also extorting wood from various villages to build scaling ladders for a final struggle. The situation north of Ningyuan has been calm for several days, with only minor contact between patrols on both sides. Sun's troops in the northern suburbs of Pingluo have been firing at the city walls since the 13th, but have not approached, seemingly a feigned attack to contain the city. There are over 3,000 wounded soldiers from Sun's troops near Yaofubao and Pingluo, who are currently being transported to Woye. It is estimated that the casualties among Sun's officers and soldiers in this battle are over 10,000, and six or seven tenths of the elite troops have been lost. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Ma Hongkui's representative in Peiping, Bai Jianmin, stated that Sun's army is currently undergoing a process of disintegration, with the troops of Zhao Guozeng, Shi Wenhua, and Li Chunhua, whom Sun had recently recruited, expressing the best intentions and gradually becoming more mature in their contact with Ma regarding surrender. Yang Yuchen, director of the Wan Army's Political Training Department, has arrived in Ning to negotiate everything with both sides due to his historical connections with those troops and Ning. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A certain important person from Shanxi stated that Sun's attack on Ningyuan was most intense on the 10th of this month. There had not been much conflict since last year. Sun's troops are now surrounded on three sides and plan to flee south of Ningyuan, and will disturb the Xihzhou and Pingliang area. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Sun Dianying sent Deputy Commander Jin Zunhua, who arrived in Peiping from Baotou on the 16th, and is scheduled to meet with He on the 17th to explain the army's westward march and discuss solutions. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the outbreak of the Sun-Ma war, the authorities, in order to ascertain the situation in Ningxia Province, specially dispatched Ma Yuchen, director of the Political Training Department of the 53rd Army, to Ning to inspect and contact all parties. Ma arrived in Lanzhou on the 14th and is expected to arrive in Ning around the 16th. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After arriving in Peiping at 2:00 PM on the 16th, Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang immediately went to the Military Council to meet with He Yingqin, where they had a secret discussion for several hours. In addition to reporting on the political and military situation in Shanxi and Sui, it is said that the decision on how to deal with Sun Dianying's troops was to give Sun himself a final admonition, hoping that he would come to his senses and comply with the central government's order, handing over his troops to Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, and Ding Futing to command separately, withdrawing north of Dengkou, and reorganizing for orders. At the same time, they are still actively seeking a military solution. If Sun still does not come to his senses, the military authorities of Shanxi, Sui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai will be responsible for encircling and suppressing him. Currently, the troops dispatched by Shanxi and Sui have already been concentrated in Wuyuan and Linhe according to the planned schedule, and two divisions have been ordered to prepare to go to Yulin in northern Shaanxi to intercept them. Sun's troops have been besieging Ningxia for nearly a month, their supplies have been cut off, and the soldiers are resentful. Once a large army is sent to pursue them, it will not be difficult to resolve the situation soon. If Sun can comply with the order and leave the army, the Peiping military authorities will guarantee his personal life and property, and give him absolute freedom of residence without restrictions. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Confirmed news: Ma Yuchen telegraphed Peiping on the 16th, reporting that he had arrived in Ningxia. In addition to inspecting the situation in Ningxia, he is also contacting Yu Shiming and others about surrendering. The Peiping authorities telegraphed Ma Hongkui on the 16th, paying close attention to the attitude of Yu and others. If they are not sincerely surrendering, do not accept them lightly. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi arrived in Peiping from Taiyuan at 2:00 PM on the 16th. At 4:00 PM, they went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin, representing Yan Xishan to discuss everything. They are scheduled to leave Peiping after a week. It is said that He, because of the arrival of Xu and Fu in Peiping, specially convened a meeting of the generals on the evening of the 17th to discuss ways to encircle and suppress Sun's army in the five provinces. After a concrete result is reached, Xu and Fu will telegraph Yan to solicit his opinion. If there are no problems, the general offensive can begin. Xu said that Yan is temporarily not returning to Taiyuan from the village on the riverbank, and his views on dealing with Sun's army are completely consistent with those of the Military Council. Currently, the Shanxi-Sui army has been ordered to move out, and the vanguard troops have arrived at a certain location. Regarding the supply and transportation of the Shanxi-Sui army, it is planned to request the central government to establish supply stations along the line to allow the Shanxi-Sui army to concentrate on fighting. Sun's army has about 60,000 people, stationed in the Baotou area, while the local residents are only about 60,000. With the resources of the people used to supply one soldier, the difficulties of Sun's army's livelihood and the suffering of the local people can be imagined. The business in Taiyuan has already gone bankrupt, and it is expected that other places will not be spared. It is not enough to save the crisis without a national plan for relief. Fu said that the Shanxi-Sui army has been ordered to dispatch two infantry divisions, one cavalry division, one independent brigade, and two artillery regiments, all of which have been opened to the appropriate locations, waiting for orders to encircle. The Military Council has appointed me as the commander-in-chief of the [unclear] route. How to deal with it in the future is entirely under the command of the Military Council. Sun's army still has considerable strength, but they are feeling very difficult with military pay. They are still claiming to advance westward. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Sun Dianying's troops stopped in the suburbs of Ning, there was no action until the 13th. From the 15th, the artillery resumed shelling the Ning army's positions. The situation is unknown. The city of Peiping has not yet received a report, but because Sun's army is trapped in an isolated area and the weather is about to warm up, and the Yellow River is about to thaw, they feel that there is no way to advance or retreat, so there is a major split within the army. The cavalry of Shi Wenhua, Zhao Guozeng, and others from the former Tang Yulin and others, led by Yu Shiming, are contacting the Ning side about surrendering, and are still in contact. As for the five-province encirclement plan, after He and Xu and Fu discussed it, the Shanxi-Sui army will be dispatched immediately. (26th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Tonight, He Yingqin will host a banquet for the generals at Jurentang to discuss how to deal with Sun's troops. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Former 19th Route Army Transferred to Henan for Training by Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>Divisions to be Stationed in the Kaifeng and Guide Area</p>
<p>Troops from Wen Chao's Division Pass Through Xuzhou Westward</p>
<p>Entire Army Can Be Transported by the End of This Month</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the former 19th Route Army was reorganized into the 7th Route Army, it was ordered to be transferred north for training. The troops under Wen Chao have been passing through Xuzhou westward in succession on the 14th and 15th. The unit boarded ships from Huangtian to Pukou, and then transferred by train to the north. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The 67th, 84th, and 49th Divisions have been transported. The 61st Division was disarmed in Huian on the 12th, and is waiting for ships to be transported to the capital. Division Commander Yang Bufei gave a speech, stating that the disarming was to prevent soldiers from selling guns privately and was different from surrendering arms. They will be issued again after arriving in the capital. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: The reorganization of the former 19th Route Army has been completed. The military authorities have decided to transfer it to Henan for training by Liu Zhi. The unarmed soldiers of the army are successively boarding ships in Putian and heading north.

<p>(Xuzhou) After the reorganization of the 19th Route Army, the soldiers were disarmed and boarded ships in Putian, sailed along the Yangtze River to Pukou, and disembarked in batches to be stationed in eastern Henan. The advance troops of Wen Chao's 78th Division passed through Xuzhou on the 14th in two trains, and another two trains passed through Xuzhou on the 15th, commanded by Regimental Commanders Deng Jingren and Fu Zhaoqian. Division Commander Wen is scheduled to pass through Xuzhou westward on the 16th, and will be stationed in Guide. According to the lower-level cadres of the unit, "We are against Chen Mingshu and others organizing a people's government, sacrificing the entire army for their benefit, and Jiang and Cai willingly joining the rebellion, causing our anti-Japanese reputation to be lost. Therefore, in this battle, the soldiers had no fighting spirit, and therefore collapsed in less than a month. Now we are under the control of the central government again. Although it is temporarily difficult, our spirits are high." (15th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The various units of the 19th Route Army are under the command and training of Liu Zhi. The 60th Division, Chen Pei, is stationed in Kaifeng, with three regiments, led by Regimental Commanders Qiu Dengyuan, Chen Sheng, and Liang Zhongren.

<h3>Huang Fu to Go to Nanjing Immediately After Receiving Gubeikou</h3>
<p>Yin Tong Says Report of Sending Representatives to Changchun is Not Accurate</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yin Tong told reporters on the 16th that Chairman Huang will go to the capital immediately after receiving Gubeikou to report on the political situation in North China. The rumor that Chairman Huang will send representatives to Changchun to negotiate various matters in North China with the Japanese is absolutely inaccurate. (16th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Related parties deny the rumor that Huang Fu will send representatives to Changchun to negotiate the pending issues in North China with the Japanese Kwantung Army. A certain party stated that after the receipt of Yuguan, the Japanese side hopes that our side will resolve the issue of the Peiping-Shenyang railway as soon as possible. Regarding the outline of the through train, although the two sides once exchanged opinions last year, it was suspended due to our side's insistence on the principle of not surrendering sovereignty and not humiliating the country. Recently, the Japanese side believes that since Yuguan has been returned, the through train incident can continue to be negotiated. This intention was indirectly expressed to the relevant parties a few days ago, which may be a misrepresentation of sending representatives to Changchun to negotiate the pending case. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sui Province Government Requisitions Grain and Transportation Vehicles</h3>
<p>Guihua: Since the Shanxi-Sui army was ordered to head west, all the vehicles and grain needed for this military operation have been requisitioned by the Sui provincial government from various counties. In order to alleviate the people's hardship, the Sui authorities have stipulated that the compensation for this service will be fully paid, and compensation will be made for any deaths. Also, fearing that the process would be too slow, the provincial government has given tens of thousands of yuan in advance. However, in fact, the counties in Sui Province were already exhausted due to the requisition of vehicles and grain by Sun's army, so they are afraid that they will not be able to prepare even if they are strictly ordered to do so. It is heard that the five counties of Gui and Baotou telegraphed the provincial government on the 12th, saying that the camels and horses were seized by Sun's army, ranging from hundreds to more than a thousand in each county. As for vehicles, except for two sets of mule carts, even civilian ox carts and Han carts were collected. Now, although the government is paying the price in full, it is impossible to hire enough vehicles in fact. As for the supply, Sun's army of tens of thousands has been stationed in western Sui for half a year, and almost everything has been requisitioned. They are now trying to find a way to deal with it, and they sincerely hope that the government will take into account the needs of Sun's army and reduce or exempt them from taxes.

<h3>Japanese Garrison in Gubeikou to Withdraw Gradually</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng to Go to Gubeikou Tomorrow</p>

He plans to go to Gubeikou with Huo Shi on the 18th to discuss the receipt with Matsui, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army and acting director of the Chengde Special Affairs Agency. It is hoped that it can be implemented around the 20th. However, there are no houses outside Gubeikou, so the Japanese garrison cannot withdraw at the same time as the receipt of Yuguan. The Japanese side intends to build barracks in the Qing Shiliang area outside the pass, and will move there after they are completed. Malanyu will be dealt with after the receipt of Gubeikou is completed. Xifengkou, Lengkou, Jielingkou, and Jiumenkou belong to the Luan-Yu area. After Tao Shangming returns to Tangshan in a few days, he will continue to carry out the receipt. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters telegraphed the whole country on the 16th to support the propositions in Wang Jiang's true telegram. The telegram said, "After reading President Wang and Chairman Chiang's joint telegram on Zhen Ri, we are deeply moved and inspired. We believe that the country has been unfortunate in recent years, with internal and external troubles pressing on us. The strategy for saving the country and surviving depends on suppressing bandits and building the country. The necessity of suppressing the Red Bandits is a common demand of the people of the country, and it is not necessary to discuss it. Even the rebellion of the Fujian rebels, who occupied one side and resisted the central government, if not for the development of Zhejiang's railway transportation, the convenience of military transport, it would not be easy to quickly quell the rebellion. The facts are in evidence, and everyone can see it. As for the collection of power and the division of governance, there is a certain limit, and progress together depends on the cooperation between the central and local governments. However, an examination of the trajectory of political progress requires the central government to collect power before the effect of dividing governance can be achieved. There is no local self-governance politics that can reach the upper level. The Prime Minister's legacy is clear, and can be reviewed. Our Party Headquarters respectfully leads the comrades of the province to carry out the propositions shown in the true telegram, work together to do things, and hope that the people of the country and the comrades of the Party will encourage each other to achieve success. We send this telegram to express our opinions and hope that you will consider them. The Kuomintang Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters." (16th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reading the Statistics of Higher Education from the Ministry of Education · Ting</h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government's Ministry of Education has compiled various statistics on higher education nationwide. The outline is clear, and the details are well-organized. The profound implications are especially sufficient to arouse our vigilance and self-reflection. This article is based on the Ministry's (Comparison Table of Higher Education in Our Country in the 20th Year with Major Countries in the World) and (Statistical Table of Domestic Higher Education in Our Country over the Past 20 Years) to examine the current status of higher education in our country from both vertical and horizontal perspectives.</p>
<p>The first table mentioned above covers twenty-two independent countries in the world and six subordinate states of the British Empire, which is considered a significant number. However, the abnormal phenomenon in China's higher education sector uniquely surpasses that of any other country. After analysis, at least three points can be made. (1) The number of students per 10,000 people is the lowest in China. (2) The number of faculty members per 100 students is the highest in China. (3) The average number of students per school is the lowest in China (except for the small state of Newfoundland). However, the number of schools ranks third highest.</p>
<p>The second table takes each year from the first to the twentieth year of the Republic of China as the longitude and various statistical items as the latitude. The following is a simple comparison between the first year and the twentieth year to show a glimpse of the initial and final state of higher education in our country over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>Year 1 Percentage Year 20 Percentage</p>
<p>Number of Schools: Vocational Schools 111 30 27 Universities 4 100 73 1,815</p>
<p>Faculty 2,312 100 7,053 305</p>
<p>Students 40,114 100 44,167 110</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the number of faculty members has increased threefold over the past twenty years, while the number of students has increased by only one-tenth. Looking at the distribution of higher education institutions, there have also been special changes, namely the decline of vocational schools and the rise of universities.</p>
<p>Combining the vertical and horizontal perspectives shown in the first and second tables, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
<p>(1) The number of students is too small, and the rate of increase is extremely slow, indicating the underdevelopment of higher education. With a population of 470 million in our country, only one person per 10,000 receives higher education. Over a long period of twenty years, the increase is only 10%, which is indeed insignificant. National construction and national rejuvenation depend on talent. The lack of talent in our country is such that the weakness of the national strength is inevitable.</p>
<p>(2) The ratio of faculty to students is uniquely high, and the rate of increase is extremely fast, indicating that there is no outlet for outstanding talent. Luo Lun, the president of National Central University, once discussed the crisis of university education in China, believing that the panic felt by talent in our country is due to (the government and schools competing for people, and schools competing with each other for people). This is certainly true. But considering the scarcity of talent in our country, there are still many who possess great skills but cannot realize their ambitions. Those who are fortunate enough to find an outlet other than entering officialdom and educational institutions are few. Therefore, Luo's criticism of the fact that schools compete for people is not surprising. Furthermore, the situation of (using what is not learned and learning what is not used) is almost universal in all strata of the country. The supply and demand sides are out of adjustment, so there is either a feeling of overstaffing or a sigh of talent panic.</p>
<p>(3) The rise of universities and the decline of vocational schools are solid evidence of the abnormal development of higher education. In the past twenty years in our country, the number of vocational schools has decreased by nearly three-quarters, while the number of universities established has increased more than eighteenfold. According to the nature of vocational schools, with very few exceptions, they are all practical subjects such as science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, while university students are overwhelmingly focused on studying literature, law, education, and art. Such an academic atmosphere that emphasizes (liberal arts) and de-emphasizes (practical subjects) is far from adequate to cope with the extraordinary environment in the future. The study of the country already has a conclusion. As for the instability of higher education institutions, which reflects the chaos of politics and the instability of society, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned shortcomings are obvious and must be urgently addressed and remedied. We believe that the remedies are: first, to actively seek the development of higher education; second, to open up various new industries to accommodate outstanding talents; and third, to break the psychological bias of emphasizing (liberal arts) and de-emphasizing (practical subjects) in the education sector. The fundamental solution lies in seeking the integrity of politics and the stability of society.</p>

<h3>Hu Xie Wu Dies Suddenly in Zheng Guan</h3>

Although Hu was nominally the chief captain, he was manipulated behind the scenes and had no real power. Chairman Yu telegraphed a reply, ordering him to wait for the investigation and disposal. The long-troubled mutiny issue will have to be handled after this matter is settled. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>New Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>British Government Low-Interest Loans</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Can Buy More British Goods</p>
<p>Old Debt Problem Not Mentioned</p>
<p>(London) The new Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty was signed at the Foreign Office this morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that the new Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty signed today aims to increase British exports to Russia, because the amount of British goods purchased by Soviet Russia is far less than the amount of Russian goods imported into Britain. The British government guarantees the loans for British goods purchased by Russia, and the interest rate will be reduced to encourage Russia to buy more British goods. The new commercial treaty does not specify any goods. It is generally believed that this treaty will encourage trade between Britain and Russia. The treaty does not mention the demands of Lena Goldfields and the issue of Russian debts to Britain. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The content of the new Anglo-Russian Commercial Treaty will be published in a white paper on February 19th. It is heard that this treaty is indeed based on improving the trade balance between the two countries. The treaty mentions the use of British ships by the Russians and stipulates an annual ratio to ensure that exports and imports are equal to each other within five years. Russia enjoys the same guarantees from the British government for outstanding debts as other countries. This treaty also stipulates that if the price of Russian goods is too low, which hinders the preferential treatment of the British Empire or hinders the production of domestic goods, Britain may ask Russia to investigate. If it is not agreed, the most preferential treatment for such goods will be cancelled immediately. The Russian commercial delegation enjoys special diplomatic treatment. As for the repayment of debts, this treaty does not mention it. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Socialist Revolution Suffers Miserable Defeat, Austrian Political Situation Will Undergo Drastic Changes</h3>
<p>Remnants of the Rebel Party Flee into the Mountains</p>
<p>Government Troops Pursue Their Victory</p>
<p>Home Guard Becomes the Backbone of Austria</p>
<p>Vienna, Thursday: Today is the fourth day of the Socialist Party uprising. Although the torch of revolution is still burning fiercely, the flames have gradually weakened.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Dollfuss has limited the rebel party to surrender in time and will grant a pardon, but by 11 a.m. when the deadline expired, few surrendered. As a result, government troops resumed their fierce attacks on the locations occupied by the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party clearly embraced the determination to die rather than surrender and resisted fiercely.</p>
<p>As of last night, the exact number of deaths could not be ascertained. Most Viennese do not know the severity of the disaster. However, the Socialist Party estimates that about 500 party members died in the fierce battle in the Floridsdorf district, and about 100 died elsewhere.</p>
<p>The town of Aibis in Upper Austria was once completely occupied by the Socialist Party. The party members forced the workers to stop work, confiscated the weapons of the military police, and blocked all roads to the capital of Linz. Before long, government troops arrived, and the party members retreated in confusion after a brief resistance. At the same time, the Socialist Party also lost its resistance in the town of Steyr in Upper Austria.</p>
<p>Several leaders of the Socialist Party were arrested, ranging in age from 18 to 27. The public prosecutor demanded the death penalty. Currently, except for one person named Galler, who has been executed, the remaining criminals are still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party, which retreated from Floridsdorf and Gotthardhof, regrouped on the Gageland and Steinbruch line, where a fierce battle took place yesterday morning. However, the Socialist Party retreated step by step and eventually fled into the surrounding forests.</p>
<p>The roads leading out of the capital of Vienna are like wartime scenes. Soldiers are standing along the way, cannons are pulled by horses, and machine guns are loaded on open cars, galloping forward. Military stoves and ambulances are ready to depart. Pedestrians are checked every fifty steps, and vehicles are searched.</p>
<p>Last night, the remaining party members who were besieged and scattered gathered in the swamps of Lobau across the Danube. It seems that this is all that remains of the surviving Socialist Party in the Vienna uprising.</p>
<p>From Sunday to yesterday, no gunshots were heard in the heart of Vienna. Residents have now resumed their normal business. Government troops in Upper Austria have been successful everywhere, and normal life is gradually returning.</p>
<p>According to recent news from Steyr, the Socialist Party, which retreated from there to the nearby wooded mountains, is now making a final resistance with machine guns. There are still battles west of Linz. The capital of Linz has returned to normal. It is expected that the party members' bullets will gradually run out, and there will be no new supplies. They will become fish in a cauldron, so it will soon be possible to announce the pacification.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the authorities engaged in confiscating the Socialist Party's property. The city councils in sixty-four districts of Upper Austria province, where the Socialist Party occupies a majority, have been dissolved.</p>
<p>According to new estimates, the total number of party members, government troops, and civilians who died from stray bullets is about 800.</p>
<p>Valisch, the mayor of Bruck in Styria, led the rebellion this time. The authorities offered a reward for his arrest. He has now fled to Yugoslavia, and his party members have returned to Bruck after abandoning their weapons. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Dollfuss Announces Policy for Suppressing Disorder</h3>
<p>New Constitution is Being Drafted</p>
<p>Workers' Rights Fully Safeguarded</p>
<p>Vienna: Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Dollfuss, in an interview today with a Reuters representative, stated that the recent incident was a reckless crime of extreme depravity. After the Socialists opened fire on police in Linz, they simultaneously announced a general strike nationwide. Fortunately, the military, police, and constabulary bravely performed their duties, quickly suppressing the disorder. Many Socialists willingly laid down their arms and declared their future loyalty to the government, which is gratifying. The general strike order was largely ignored, proving that most workers have changed their attitude, abandoning Socialism in spirit and accepting the government's new policies. Dr. Dollfuss concluded by saying that a new constitution is being drafted, which will protect the full rights of the working class, eliminate class warfare, and unite all efforts to seek national and popular welfare. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The Austrian government has also issued an order dissolving twenty-six organizations within the country affiliated with the Socialist Party. All real estate of these organizations has been confiscated, with the printing trade union being the most important. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Tens of thousands of Socialists have surrendered their weapons. Only a few areas outside the city remain where party members are holding out, but they have lost their fighting spirit and have not challenged government forces at night. Today, the government issued an order announcing that the barbed wire obstacles set up in the city will be removed by Friday. Streetcars in the city and suburbs have resumed operation, demonstrating the government's strong belief that it has control of the overall situation. (National News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The Socialists' desperate resistance to government forces is reaching its end. It is reported that workers are now abandoning the Socialist Party and surrendering to the government. Many of the Socialists' fortified positions are flying white flags. However, the Socialist headquarters does not seem to have decided to cease hostilities. Today, it continues to widely distribute leaflets, urging workers to resist vigorously, claiming that comrades from all provinces will arrive soon to provide assistance and lift the siege. Archbishop Innitzer of Vienna has published an article calling on Austrians, regardless of their party affiliation, to immediately end the bloodshed. (National News dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Statement by the Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Home Guard</h3>
<p>Austrians Do Not Welcome National Socialism</p>
<p>But Need Strong Dictatorial Rule</p>
<p>(London) The Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Home Guard, Starhemberg, told a correspondent of the London Morning Post in Linz that it is impossible for Austria to implement a National Socialist system. National Socialism is cruel and not welcomed by Austrians. Austria currently needs a dictator with unlimited power, which will last until a new constitution can be appropriately implemented. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Except for remote provinces, Prime Minister Dollfuss and the Home Guard are now masters of Austria. However, the Socialist Party seems to be adopting a new guerrilla warfare strategy. Gunfire occurred this morning in Stadtpark in Vienna, as someone attempted to assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Fey while he was passing by in a car. The streets of Vienna are gradually returning to their former appearance, and business is proceeding as usual. The curfew has been changed, and cafes and theaters can operate until 8 PM. Over two thousand Socialists are currently detained in a factory and military camps. Temporary courts have been established throughout Austria, with the power to impose the death penalty. Trials have already begun. In Linz, a certain dyer who served as a hangman during the European War is now the executioner. The Austrian political situation is currently chaotic. It is said that the leader of the Home Guard, Starhemberg, will meet with Prime Minister Dollfuss today to present a firm demand for the adoption of a practical Fascist system. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The war in Austria began like a swift and angry tide and ended like a sudden downpour. Various precautionary plans are still being implemented and have not been cancelled. The Home Guard is now working with the army to confiscate weapons from Socialist soldiers. During the war, the fire brigade repeatedly transmitted secret messages to the Socialists, so its headquarters has now been occupied by the Home Guard. (National News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Approximately five hundred Jews fled to this area from Lodz and the surrounding areas of Austria today. These individuals believe that the Socialist Party will surely fail completely. Afterwards, the Austrian Nationalists will rise to power. Jews have always been involved in Austria's Marxist movement, so they feel it is prudent to be prepared and relocate to a better place.

Today, the Daily Telegraph confirmed these rumors, stating that the British government had expressed to Dollfuss and the Austrian cabinet in a very tactful and friendly manner its hope that they would show leniency after the victory.

In fact, Italy has no intention of intervening. However, if Austria is militarily threatened by an outside force, then Italy would have reason to assist Austria. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) National Socialist propagandist Happe (formerly an intelligence specialist at the German Embassy in Austria, who was expelled by the Austrian government) delivered a radio address tonight, discussing the Austrian situation and the policies of the National Socialist Party in Austria. Happe accused the Dollfuss government of appealing to various governments that Germany was interfering in Austria's internal affairs. The National Socialist Party bears no responsibility for the recent events in Austria. Happe then launched a fierce attack on the Dollfuss cabinet, accusing it of undermining the interests of the Germanic people and endangering European peace. The current situation is tantamount to various countries vying for profits in Austria, a struggle the National Socialist Party witnesses with great sorrow. The party is determined not to sacrifice a single person or bullet without reason, but if the Austrian problem is resolved according to National Socialism, the National Socialist Party is prepared to sacrifice at any time to achieve its goal. Happe concluded by stating that the Austrian rulers have a great responsibility to the Germanic people and must wake up and avoid the greatest danger (referring to communism) by various means. It is not too late to act now. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Socialist Uprising in Austria Promoted by Home Guard</h3>
<p>Civil Republicanism Destroyed by Gunfire</p>
<p>Nationalism Has Become the Greatest Enemy Thereafter</p>
<p>(London) A special Central European correspondent for the Daily Telegraph reported that the Austrian unrest has nothing to do with the Communist Party. It was instigated by leaders of the Home Guard pressing Prime Minister Dollfuss to implement the plan that the group had attempted in 1929 but failed to realize. Austrian civil republicanism has now been destroyed by the government's gunfire, and many lives have been sacrificed. After this unrest is quelled, Dollfuss will have one great enemy, which is National Socialism. The Times' Vienna correspondent reported that the Socialist Party estimates that by Tuesday evening, 1,500 party members had been arrested, not including those who died in the fierce battle in Floridsdorf. It is now believed that there were 350 deaths in Karl-Marx-Hof alone, many of whom were unarmed residents. (National News dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Truth newspaper commented on the Austrian situation, stating that the most important revolutionary event is developing in Central Europe, and it has broken through the small borders of Austria. Since the workers of France raised the slogan against the increasingly shameless reaction and fascism and rose up in unison, the heroic war of the Austrian workers has again confirmed the formidable arrogance of capitalist Europe. The Truth reiterated that the majority of social democratic parties and workers' self-defense organizations disregarded the instructions of the social democratic party leaders and joined forces with the communist workers to fight because this movement has moved far beyond the reach of these leaders. At the same time, the Austrian events have proved how high the tide of the anti-fascist struggle in Europe has risen. (TASS dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>France Replies Again to Germany's Proposal to Maintain Disarmament</h3>
<p>France Does Not Answer Any of Germany's Proposals</p>
<p>Berlin Prepares to Respond Again</p>
<p>(Paris) The main point of France's reply to the German disarmament memorandum is that the German National Socialist Sturmabteilung must be regarded as troops. As for the various proposals and attached questions put forward by Germany, France will not answer any of them. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, the German government believes that the French reply does not help disarmament because what France has stated is still what Germany does not recognize. However, the reply did not close the door to future negotiations, which can be considered satisfactory. Germany will respond at an appropriate time. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) On January 19 of this year, the German government sent a memorandum on the issue of disarmament to the French government. Recently, the French cabinet prepared a written reply, which was personally delivered to German Foreign Minister Neurath by French Ambassador Poncet. Its content has now been announced. The French reply stated that the French government had notified Germany of a concrete and precise plan regarding the issue of disarmament in its memorandum sent to Germany on January 1 of this year. However, Germany's letter on January 19 still stated that the powerful countries were unwilling to take truly effective disarmament measures, a claim for which Germany should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>The French government deeply regrets the following two points: First, Germany's letter on January 19 failed to provide a full explanation of its views on the military monitoring system. Second, France's memorandum to Germany on January 1 expressed opinions on the scope of the non-aggression treaty and its relationship with the Locarno Treaty, but the German government has not paid attention to it.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two issues that France considers fundamental: (1) The military strength of France and Germany can only be compared with the number of troops in the main force, and all forces of a military nature must be included; (2) Military weapons that Germany is prohibited from using by the peace treaty can only be granted to Germany after the German army is reorganized. All groups receiving preliminary military training in Germany, as well as military groups outside the formal army, should be included in the calculation of troops and be subject to the restrictions of the disarmament convention. However, the German government refused to accept these two points, rejecting the entire plan outlined in France's January 1 memorandum.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the French government considers it unnecessary to reply to the various questions attached to Germany's January 19 memorandum.</p>
<p>The various complex issues listed are relevant to all countries at the Disarmament Conference, and it is particularly difficult for France and Germany to negotiate on their own. If a preliminary study must be conducted between France and Germany, it would be beneficial only if a precise agreement is reached on various accurate principles. However, this is not the case in fact. According to publicly available documents, the capacity of the German army, in terms of its organization, troop strength, and the weapons it uses, is not in line with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, which must be used as the basis for comparing the military strength of the two countries in the future.</p>
<p>An effective international system for monitoring military equipment is a major factor in future disarmament conventions and must be defined quickly. This is why France hopes to establish an effective international monitoring system when the disarmament convention begins to be implemented. This proposal does not seem to harm Germany's national dignity in any way.</p>
<p>In addition, France has no intention of supplementing the reduced number of its main forces with overseas troops, nor does it intend to leave overseas troops unrestricted. This is contrary to what Germany has speculated.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the most important issue, France's reply stated that the disarmament convention should restrict all forces of a military nature, including military groups outside the formal army and militarized police. This is France's position, but the German memorandum rejected it. France still maintains its consistent position: if one party enters into a disarmament convention and leaves the military value of military groups outside the formal army undetermined and leaves it to be decided later, the disarmament convention will be fundamentally shaken first. The issue of monitoring military equipment is particularly important and should not be taken lightly. France cannot sign such a convention. The German government should now provide a clear explanation to eliminate or prevent any ambiguities. France will study this explanation with an open mind because the French government still maintains the proposals listed in its January 1 memorandum. The French government has no doubt about Germany's willingness and sincerity to cooperate, but it believes that if differences of opinion that hinder the conclusion of a final compromise can be recognized and discussed openly, and efforts are made to bring them closer together, it will not harm the negotiations between the two parties.

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Confirms Confidence in Doumergue's New Government</h3>
<p>Atmosphere Outside Parliament Different from Before</p>
<p>Cabinet Declaration First Calls on All Parties to Cease Conflict</p>
<p>Will Resign if Budget is Not Passed</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in Doumergue's new government by a large majority of 402 to 125, with 68 abstentions. When the new Prime Minister entered the Chamber, the entire body, except for the Communist Party, stood up and welcomed him with cheers. The new government's declaration was also welcomed by both houses of parliament. The atmosphere outside Parliament is different from before. A week ago, crowds rioted and tried to force their way in, but were stopped by the military and police. Today, only six police officers are stationed guarding the gate. The government's declaration was very serious, first calling on all parties to cooperate and cease conflict so that the judicial work of investigating the fraud case could be accomplished. It then spoke of the necessity of balancing the budget and stabilizing the monetary system, considering these as prerequisites for relieving unemployment. Finally, it stated that domestic peace is the most essential thing and that the government should adopt effective methods to place the country outside the scope of dangerous incidents. The Radical Party has now decided to support the government, so Doumergue will definitely have the support of the majority. However, Doumergue has demanded that Parliament must vote on the budget before March 1. If Parliament refuses, Doumergue will inevitably resign. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Socialist Party of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting and decided to vote against Doumergue's new government. The Socialist Party advocates dissolving Parliament and opposes reducing budget debate. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

Of the 125 members who voted against, there were 97 orthodox Socialists, 3 new Socialists, 9 members of the Labor Union Party (i.e., left-leaning separatist elements of the General Confederation of Labor), 10 Communists, 1 Republican Socialist, 3 independent leftists, and 2 unaffiliated members. In addition, there were a total of 68 abstentions, including 26 Radical Socialists, 14 Republican Socialists, 23 new Socialists, 2 independent leftists, 1 orthodox Socialist, and 2 unaffiliated members.

<h3>Russian-Polish Cooperation to Maintain Peace in Eastern Europe</h3>

<p>Polish Foreign Minister Hurries Back to Warsaw</p>
<p>(Moscow) Polish Foreign Minister Beck left here today and hurriedly returned to Warsaw. The Polish embassy hosted Soviet and foreign journalists in Moscow and issued the following joint statement: Foreign Minister Beck's three-day stay in Moscow allowed him and Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov to have numerous lengthy talks. They discussed the general international situation and the international issues arising therefrom, and consulted in particular on issues relating to or potentially relating to the interests of the Soviet Union and the Republic of Poland. During the exchange of views, Litvinov and Beck shared the same views on the majority of issues and expressed that the governments they represented were determined to continue their efforts to make Soviet-Polish relations even more friendly. Their talks also showed that the people of both countries are working for universal goodwill, based on the Treaty of Non-Aggression and the Convention on Defining Aggression signed by the two governments, and hope that the effectiveness of these conventions will be extended as much as possible. Both governments are willing to carry out future cooperation under this guidance in order to maintain and promote world peace, and pay the most attention to cooperation in maintaining peace and normal relations in Eastern Europe, which is most urgent for preserving the interests of the two governments. At the same time, in order to adapt to the existing relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and the increasing importance and importance of the possibility of international cooperation between the two governments, Beck, on behalf of his government, proposed that the diplomatic missions established by the two countries in Moscow and Warsaw should be upgraded to embassies. Litvinov agreed with Beck's opinion and accepted Beck's proposal in the name of the Soviet government. (TASS dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Huge Political Turmoil in Japan: Saito Cabinet Shaken</h3>
<p>Education Minister Hatoyama Accepted a Bribe of 50,000 Yen</p>
<p>Major Internal Strife in the Seiyukai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issues of Education Minister Hatoyama's discipline disclosed by Representative Okamoto at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 15th, as well as the issues of discipline of Vice Minister of Railways Mitsuchi and Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda, are now attracting attention from all parties. If the investigation committee begins to examine this issue, its impact will inevitably extend to the House of Peers. External movements to clarify the issue will also be carried out simultaneously outside the Diet. If the content of the discipline issues is exposed, the positions of Ministers Hatoyama, Mitsuchi, and Nagai will be in danger. Some political circles intend to take advantage of this issue to thoroughly pursue and take the life of the Saito Cabinet. Another section has already begun preparing for the next cabinet. How the discipline issue develops in the investigation committee can cause a major change in the political world, and its future deserves the most attention. (Japanese Union News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice Investigates Education Minister Hatoyama's Discipline Issue</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Justice Minister Koyama, because Okamoto disclosed yesterday in the Diet the so-called "Sakhalin Industries 50,000 Yen issue" of Education Minister Hatoyama, aroused general attention. Given the importance of this issue, he immediately ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate the truth in order to respond to the demands of the investigation committee and prove the issue. According to the results of the investigation by the judicial authorities:</p>
<p>(1) The Sakhalin Industries Company's breach of trust and embezzlement case was exposed during the medal-selling incident in Showa 5, but Hatoyama was not charged because of this issue.</p>
<p>(2) It is not true that Sakhalin Industries Company gave Okamoto 50,000 yen.</p>
<p>(3) It is true that Daikawa Heisaburo, president of Sakhalin Industries Company, provided Hatoyama with 50,000 yen in election expenses, but this was a personal act and had no criminal nature. (Japanese Union News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Reason for Discipline Issue Lies in Internal Strife Within the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito Party believes that the discipline issue has a significant relationship to the political situation and directly affects the fate of the cabinet. Therefore, it is considering thorough countermeasures for this issue. The occurrence of this issue this time is actually due to the internal strife between the Suzuki faction and the anti-Suzuki faction within the Seiyukai. The anti-Suzuki faction has a superior force than the Suzuki faction. The purpose of the anti-Suzuki faction in expanding this issue is to harm Education Minister Hatoyama with the discipline issue raised by Okamoto and bury his influence in the political world. In that case, President Suzuki would have to take responsibility for recommending Hatoyama for the cabinet and resign in shame. If this internal struggle within the Seiyukai becomes blatant, it will inevitably split into two factions, or the president will be replaced in order to unite the party. Otherwise, it will not be possible to restore the normal political path and regain the party's credibility. (Japanese Union News dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Three Pillars of Power: The Political Friends Association Falls into a State of Uncontrolled</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Internal strife within the Seiyukai (Political Friends Association) is worsening. The issue of expulsion from the party is becoming a difficult problem. Although the understanding of the elders has been sought, Mochizuki Keisuke and Tokonami Takejiro, two of the elders, and their advisors, remain unmoved. Therefore, a decision on whether or not to expel members cannot be reached, and the party has fallen into a state of uncontrolled chaos. The executive faction, the Kuhara faction, and the Tokonami faction are all taking opposing stances, and the situation is escalating, making it difficult to resolve. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the disciplinary issue of Okamoto Kazumi, the long-standing internal conflict within the Seiyukai has surfaced. The executives are deeply concerned about this situation. President Suzuki and Minister Hatoyama and others have been gathering since last night to discuss countermeasures. However, it has now been learned that a part of the Kuhara faction and a part of the Tokonami faction are scheming behind Okamoto. Therefore, it has been decided to decisively punish and expel destabilizing elements. At this afternoon's executive meeting, it was decided to expel six people: Tsugumo Kunitoshi, Kuramoto Yōichi, Nanba Kiyoto, Takakura Hiroshi, Nishikata Rima, and Yoshida Tomoaki. In addition, Nagashima Ryūji's actions have also become a problem, but he will not be expelled. (Dentsu Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the expulsion of destabilizing elements within the Seiyukai, such as Tsugumo Kunitoshi, as decided by the executive meeting, it was strongly advocated by President Suzuki and Minister Hatoyama. However, the elders and executives such as Tokonami, Okazaki, Yamamoto Jō, Yamamoto Tei, Maeda, Akita, Hamada, and Yamazaki, all opposed this move. Furthermore, the majority of the general affairs officers also have unstable opposing opinions, so the expulsion is likely to cause problems. (Dentsu Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The internal conflict within the Seiyukai stems from the Kuhara faction's accusation of Okamoto Kazumi's disciplinary issues, considering it an instigation of anti-Suzuki sentiment. The President's faction is retaliating, and the Tokonami faction has also entered the fray, beginning to scheme. Concerned about the situation, the Seiyukai executives fear that the internal conflict will expand, causing the credibility of party politics to plummet and damaging the dignity of the Diet. Therefore, they plan to first sever the root of the trouble. They observed the actual situation in the Diet on the 15th, and decided that anyone who openly disrupts the internal affairs or attempts to do so will be expelled from the party to prevent the problem from escalating. On the morning of the 16th, the general affairs secretaries and others discussed and concluded the previous expulsion measures. Those who should be expelled from the party include Tsugumo Kunitoshi, Nanba Kiyoto, Nishikata Rima, and Yokura Hiroshi. After obtaining the understanding of the elders, this will be implemented on the 16th. The hardliners are insisting that Yoshida Akira, Nagashima Ryūji, and Kuramoto Yōichi, in addition to the prior group, should also be expelled, and are pressuring the executives to carry out this action. On the other hand, the Kuhara faction is confronting this and devising various countermeasures. If the executive faction carries out the expulsion, they are determined to fight to the end within the party. The internal conflict within the Seiyukai is becoming increasingly apparent, and it seems that a split is unavoidable. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Araki Suddenly Returns to Tokyo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Army Minister Araki Sadao returned to Tokyo yesterday from Atami. This afternoon, he met with Finance Minister Takahashi and other cabinet members in the minister's office in the Diet, and said that he had now recovered and had left the hospital yesterday. He also visited the speakers of both houses of the Diet, saying that his resignation due to illness during the Diet session was truly unavoidable. It is said that Araki plans to go to Atami for another week of recuperation. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Believes There is a Hidden Hand</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The stone thrown by Okamoto Kazumi has caused a major upheaval in the Seiyukai. Its executives held an emergency meeting and decided on their attitude this time. A commission of inquiry will thoroughly investigate the truth. If it is confirmed that both Minister Hatoyama and Minister Mitsuchi have no evidence of bribery, then Okamoto Kazumi will be severely punished. It is believed that behind Okamoto's remarks and the separation of Eto Genkuro from the party, there must be a powerful force as a hidden hand, attempting to harm the credibility of party politics and hinder the reconstruction movement of parliamentary politics. The Seiyukai will unite to confront this anti-party force, reveal the truth, sweep away the doubts of the world, and move towards the goal of establishing party politics. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Okamoto Raises Disciplinary Issue, House of Representatives Becomes Tense</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Okamoto Kazumi of the Seiyukai was expelled from the party for attacking members of his own party. On the 15th, the House of Representatives discussed the issue of disciplinary rectification raised by Okamoto, and the atmosphere in the Diet was extremely tense, with the attending members quite excited. The meeting opened at 1:15 PM, and Speaker Akita immediately announced a recess. During this time, the Seiyukai and each faction held separate meetings. The Diet reconvened at 1:30 PM, and Speaker Akita said to the whole body, "The issue of Okamoto Kazumi's remarks at this meeting on the 8th is now being addressed by Mr. Yoneda Kikuma and Mr. Hayashi Jōji, who will explain personal matters." Yoneda immediately took the podium and said, "I have no connection with the Bancho Association proposed by Mr. Okamoto. It is regrettable that Mr. Okamoto has harmed others with speculation and conjecture." Hayashi continued the explanation, saying, "Mr. Okamoto's words and actions have no basis." At this time, Okamoto also requested to speak, but the speaker did not allow it. Taniwara of the Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party) submitted an emergency motion to establish a commission of inquiry to investigate Okamoto's issue. Taniwara explained, "This House should establish a commission of inquiry to clarify the truth about Mr. Yoneyama, Mr. Hayashi, and Mr. Okamoto, in order to sweep away doubts and maintain the prestige of parliamentary politics." Okamoto again requested to speak, and the speaker allowed it. Okamoto then spoke about the disciplinary issues of the two ministers, Mitsuchi and Hatoyama, causing the Diet to become chaotic. The speaker had no choice but to prohibit Okamoto from speaking. As a result of a vote by the whole body, the issue of establishing a commission of inquiry was approved.

<h3>Russia Raises Currency Exchange Rate, Japanese Government Protests</h3>
<p>Japanese Officials Denied Inspection of Fishing Grounds</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the Soviet government will hold an auction of North Pacific fisheries on the 20th, it recently suddenly raised the exchange rate of Japanese-Russian currency to 7.5 sen per ruble. Although the Japanese government protested, it was ignored and preparations for the auction are proceeding. On the 15th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry sent an important telegram to Ambassador Ota in Russia, ordering him to lodge a strong protest with the Russian government. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current method of converting each ruble to 3.2 sen of Japanese gold was agreed upon by Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara and Toraianovsky in 1931 and has not changed to this day.</p>
<p>(2) This conversion rate is an agreement between governments. The Soviet Union's announcement to the people and industrialists to change the conversion rate is an illegal act.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese government believes that the current conversion rate is appropriate and demands that the Russian government withdraw the 7.5 sen proposal.</p>
<p>(4) The Russian government's refusal to allow Japanese officials to go to Russia to inspect the auction of fishing grounds is regrettable to the Japanese government. (Jiji News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>Shandong Province Increases Printing of Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>Total Issuance Including Previous Issues is Six Million</p>
<p>Approved by Provincial Government Decision</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The provincial treasury bills circulating in the market of Shandong Province were originally issued to increase the provincial treasury and adjust social finance. The original amount was 3 million yuan, which was exchanged by the Shandong Provincial Minsheng Bank and the Ping Municipal Official Money Bureau. The original term was one year, which expired in June of last year. Subsequently, the Finance Department was approved by the Ministry of Finance to extend it for another year. Recently, the Director of Finance Wang Xiangrong, because the original provincial treasury bill plate was slightly crude, proposed entrusting the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to change the plate and reissue it as usual, still managed by the Minsheng Bank and the Ping Municipal Official Money Bureau. The words "Shandong Provincial Treasury Bill, Managed and Issued by Minsheng Bank" will also be printed on the face of the bill, and an additional 3 million yuan of reserve bills will be printed to be issued at any time. All issued treasury bills will be exchanged for new bills, and the original funds will still be used as a reserve for exchange. Yesterday, Wang submitted the proposal to the Provincial Political Council for discussion, which was approved. His submission to the Provincial Government stated: (This department is responsible for finance and expenditure. In order to adjust local finance and provide necessary relief for the annual budget, in June of the 21st year [of the Republic], in accordance with Article 12 of the Provincial Accounting Regulations, this department submitted a request to your government to issue 3 million yuan of provincial treasury bills, ordering each county to prepare cash to exchange for them in the province, which would be allowed to pay taxes and would circulate like hard currency. Sufficient cash was prepared, and the Shandong Provincial Minsheng Bank and the Ping Municipal Official Money Bureau were entrusted to exchange them at any time without restrictions. Since the issuance, merchants and people have found it convenient and the reputation has increased day by day. Subsequently, as of June of the 22nd year [of the Republic], the one-year issuance period expired, and this department once again submitted a request to your government, which approved the continued issuance for another year, and entrusted the Minsheng Bank to manage the issuance and exchange of these bills. The establishment of the Minsheng Bank and the issuance of treasury bills are related matters, but they are essential to the economic policy and financial plan of this province. The two are closely related. Since the Minsheng Bank of Shandong was entrusted to manage the issuance of treasury bills, not only have merchants and people been happy to use them, but it is expected that they will circulate permanently. The funds exchanged by each county and stored for exchange will also increase the bank's credit. This Director has observed that the current circulation is no different in value from the banknotes of the Bank of Communications of China. The facts are clear, and the future is promising. However, adjusting the economy depends on enriching finance, and developing banks requires relying on paper money. When the Minsheng Bank was being established, the original regulations were intended to include the issuance of exchange bills, but the Ministry of Finance did not approve it, and the regulations had to be revised. This is why the bank could not issue paper money. Now that the bank has been open for more than a year, with a surplus of more than 200,000 yuan, the work can be called developed. If it can continue to work hard in the long term and be supplemented by the right to issue paper money, then the bank's future will be bright, and the results will be considerable. However, the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the right of local banks to issue paper money and does not easily grant it to others. Even if a way is found to persuade them to approve it, the huge amount of paper money issuance tax paid annually is also uneconomical. At this time, when the foundation of the treasury bills is solid and the Minsheng Bank's work is prosperous, in order to prepare for the needs of the annual budget and develop the bank's business, it is proposed to entrust the Ministry of Finance to completely entrust the Minsheng Bank to manage the provincial treasury bills, indicating that the Minsheng Bank of Shandong manages the provincial treasury bills, and print an additional 3 million yuan of reserve bills, for a total of 6 million yuan, to be issued at any time. New bills will be exchanged for old bills, and the original funds will be used as a reserve for exchange. In this way, it will have the benefits of paper money without the name of paper money. The economy and livelihood will rely on it. It is appropriate to submit this request for approval.) (February 13)</p>
<h3>The Current Status of Northeast China's Finance and Trade (Correspondent from Changchun)</h3>
<p>Heavy Taxes and Economic Decline</p>
<p>Foreign Markets Occupied by the Japanese</p>
<p>The economy of Northeast China is declining, leading to a so-called "famine in a year of abundance" in rural areas. The reason for this is the bumper harvest of special products and the closure of overseas markets. However, the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies of the puppet government are also one of the driving forces. The puppet government's annual income largely depends on taxes. With heavy taxes, economic decline and rural bankruptcy are inevitable.</p>
<p>To clarify the role of these taxes in the puppet state's annual income, we have excerpted the budget announced for the past year (July 1, last year to June 30 this year) as follows:</p>
<p>1933 Budget of the Puppet State's General Accounting (Unit: 1,000 Yuan)</p>
<p>Category</p>
<p>Regular Revenue 132,134</p>
<p>Taxes 108,629</p>
<p>Customs Duties 49,781</p>
<p>National Taxes 38,111</p>
<p>Salt Tax 20,763</p>
<p>Monopoly Profit 15,386</p>
<p>Monopoly Bureau Profit 9,828</p>
<p>Jihei Transportation Authority Profit 5,000</p>
<p>Other 558</p>
<p>Official Property and Other Income 8,118</p>
<p>Temporary Revenue 17,034</p>
<p>Total 149,169</p>
<p>In the above table, tax revenue accounts for more than 82.2% of regular revenue and more than 72.8% of total revenue, which shows its high proportion.</p>
<p>There have been significant changes in the national distribution of Northeast China's foreign trade compared to the past. The following table shows the main foreign trade of Northeast China:</p>
<p>(Exports)</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>
<p>Country Export Value (1,000 Yuan) Percentage of Total Exports (%) Export Value (1,000 Yuan) Percentage of Total Exports (%)</p>
<p>Japan 103,848 44.8 127,576 45.7</p>
<p>Mainland China 58,731 23.6 26,743 9.5</p>
<p>United Kingdom 17,992 7.2 23,791 9.2</p>
<p>Netherlands 24,779 9.9 23,862 0.8</p>
<p>France 1,706 0.6 2,460 7.0</p>
<p>Germany 4,707 1.8 19,623 7.0</p>
<p>United States 3,434 1.4 6,682 2.3</p>
<p>Other Total 248,327 100.0 278,999 100.0</p>
<p>(Imports)</p>
<p>1932 1932</p>
<p>Country Import Value (1,000 Yuan) Percentage of Total Imports (%) Import Value (1,000 Yuan) Percentage of Total Imports (%)</p>
<p>Japan 104,060 66.1 209,818 70.8</p>
<p>Mainland China 33,045 20.9 39,318 12.2</p>
<p>United Kingdom 2,345 1.4 3,237 1.0</p>
<p>Netherlands 602 0.2 1,660 0.5</p>
<p>France 227 0.1 154</p>
<p>Germany 2,088 1.3 2,367 0.7</p>
<p>United States 1,716 1.1 7,928 2.6</p>
<p>Other Total 157,359 100.0 296,302 100.0</p>
<p>From the above figures, we can see that, whether it is export or import, the proportion of Mainland China has dropped sharply. Exports have fallen from 23.6% to 9.5%, and imports have fallen from 20.9% to 13.2%. The proportion of Japan has increased significantly. That is, exports have increased from 41.8% to 45.7%, and imports have increased from 66.1% to 70.8%. In other words, Japanese goods have gradually driven Mainland China out of the Northeast China trade market. Judging from the trend, Japan will increasingly monopolize the Northeast China market and place all economic activities under its control, making it a part of its entire economic system.</p>
<p>Further research on the goods that Japan imports into Northeast China shows that they are cotton textiles, wheat flour, sugar, machinery materials, and cement, etc. The following table lists the main imports from Japan in 1932 and 1933 (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>
<p>Category 1933 1932 Actual Increase Percentage Increase (%)</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles 35,251 14,765 20,488 138.7</p>
<p>Wheat Flour 26,504 9,704 16,800 173.1</p>
<p>Iron 21,600 7,047 14,332 206.5</p>
<p>Machinery and Parts 12,412 3,080 9,332 302.9</p>
<p>Sugar 6,391 3,888 2,503 64.3</p>
<p>Cement 1,881 528 1,353 256.2</p>
<p>Iron Products 6,072 2,263 3,809 168.3</p>
<p>Vehicles and Parts 12,802 2,131 10,671 500.7</p>
<p>Paper 5,746 2,818 2,928 105.9</p>
<p>Aquatic Products 1,753 1,476 277 18.7</p>
<p>The trade between Japan and Northeast China is as described above. As for the main categories of exports and imports in Northeast China's entire trade, they are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Main Exports (January to October 1933, Unit: 1,000 Yuan)</p>
<p>Soybeans ▲ 118,046</p>
<p>Red Beans ▲ 5,133</p>
<p>Sorghum ▲ 2,121</p>
<p>Corn ▲ 425</p>
<p>Peanuts ▲ 7,650</p>
<p>Cotton Silk Textiles 6,563</p>
<p>Iron and Steel 7,811</p>
<p>Soybean Oil ▲ 12,885</p>
<p>Soybean Meal ▲ 35,779</p>
<p>Coal 20,156</p>
<p>Salt 3,276</p>
<p>(Note) The items marked with ▲ in the above list are Northeast China's special products.</p>
<p>Main Imports (January to October 1933, Unit: 1,000 Yuan)</p>
<p>Wheat Flour 32,438</p>
<p>Sugar 8,489</p>
<p>Tobacco 9,770</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles 39,135</p>
<p>Gunny Sacks 7,251</p>
<p>Building Materials 22,897</p>
<p>Petroleum 2,874</p>
<p>Machinery and Equipment 6,229</p>
<p>Rice 2,006</p>
<p>Oils and Fats 8,263</p>
<p>The current status of trade in Northeast China is roughly as described above. That is, Japan's trade volume is gradually expanding, and the markets of other countries are gradually being eroded. Under the puppet regime of the Japanese, and after decades of operation and aggression, this situation is not surprising. What is painful is that the people of Northeast China are living in dire straits and cannot free themselves. Three or four years ago, the vigorous vitality of various industries in Northeast China has been completely destroyed today.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Speech on Revitalizing the National Foundation</h3>
<p>Start with the three words: Education, Cultivation, and Protection.</p>
<p>Encouraging everyone to understand their own responsibilities.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Military Headquarters convened an expanded memorial week at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 12th), gathering all party, government, and military organizations in the province. Present were the heads of all departments and sections of the military headquarters, all members of the provincial government, all members of the provincial party headquarters, and responsible personnel from various organizations, totaling over 200 people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony and gave instructions to the attendees, urging everyone to recognize their responsibilities as the basic work for the revival of the Chinese nation. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The suppression of bandits in Jiangxi is related to the life and death of the nation and the hope of the Chinese nation's revival. It depends on whether the Red bandits in Jiangxi can be completely eliminated. If we want to revive the national state, we must make Jiangxi a foundation. Regardless of the comrades from all walks of life in the party, government, and military, everyone in Jiangxi bears this responsibility. Everyone must work together in the environment of bandit suppression in Jiangxi to create the foundation for the revival of the nation. However, the Chinese people have a common problem: they do not understand their own responsibilities, nor do they know their own capabilities. Since they do not understand their responsibilities and give up their capabilities, they can only procrastinate and delay matters, and perfunctorily fulfill their duties. At this time of national life and death, how can we make mistakes again and again? Therefore, now, regardless of which circle of comrades in the party, government, or military, everyone must have the spirit of recognizing their responsibilities. In particular, Nanchang, the center of bandit suppression, is the location for the entire spirit of bandit suppression. All comrades in Nanchang should examine their own responsibilities and capabilities, work harder, and immerse themselves in hard work to create a trend. We must make the trend in Nanchang permeate the whole country and the whole world. Only then will the Chinese nation have hope of revival. This is what I hope from all comrades.</p>
<p>However, knowing one's responsibility but not being able to bring it into play is the same as not knowing. Therefore, in order to understand one's own responsibility, it is necessary to tell others about it. To make one person's responsibility exert the effectiveness of thousands of people, this means that those who can understand their own responsibility can better direct their subordinates, such as the government directing civil servants and the military directing soldiers. Only by directing the steps can we supervise our subordinates. If we can urge our subordinates to understand their responsibilities, then the bandit suppression work will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Great Learning says, "Things have roots and branches, and affairs have ends and beginnings. To know what is first and what is last will lead one near to what is taught in the Great Learning." That is to say, things have a distinction between what comes first and what comes later, and what is important and what is not. If the order is reversed and the importance is not distinguished, then success will never be achieved. Teaching people to first understand their responsibilities is to first make them understand their responsibilities and then be able to complete this work. This is what it means to lead people well.</p>
<p>Just now, I said that the foundation for national revival should be established in the place where bandits are suppressed in Jiangxi. But how exactly should this be done? Now, let's first talk about its outline, which is the three words: Education, Cultivation, and Protection. The ancients said, "Ten years of gathering, ten years of nurturing," which is the meaning of these three words. Therefore, the work of these three words does not require force, and the power it generates is hundreds of times greater than force. However, this kind of teaching cannot be like the teaching method of school teachers, relying only on books and blackboards. It must be taught to everyone, anytime and anywhere, so that there is no place that is not a school and no one who is not a teacher. Only then can this task be completed. How can we achieve the purpose of education? How can we achieve the purpose of cultivation? How can we achieve the purpose of protection? How can we realize this kind of responsibility? Now, let's analyze it one by one. (1) The meaning of education lies in teaching others what one already knows. What the government knows, teach it to the people. What the party headquarters knows, teach it to the party members. What the superior knows, teach it to the staff. What the army knows, teach it to the subordinates. What the police know, teach it to society. Regardless of whether they are government officials, party officials, military officers, or public security police, those who know but do not teach are their own misfortune. But what is the meaning of education? It is the four virtues: (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame). The ancients said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four cardinal principles of a nation. If the four cardinal principles are not upheld, the nation will perish. Now, if we want to revive the nation and revive the country, we must promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. If the whole country, from top to bottom, can know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then the national spirit will naturally rise. If we want to revive the nation, we must use integrity and shame as weapons. (2) Cultivation means nurturing. What is the meaning of nurturing? It is the four essentials of life that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of (clothing, food, housing, and transportation). Generally speaking, a person, from birth, cannot lack one of these four words. Eating, clothing, housing, and transportation must have discipline in order to express a person's spirit. If a person eats at irregular times, wears unclean clothes, lives in untidy houses, and walks without observing order, then his character will be loose and decadent, which can be imagined. Therefore, there are four conditions for eating, clothing, housing, and transportation, namely, economic, clean, simple, and frugal. Only by meeting these four conditions is legitimate eating, clothing, housing, and transportation. From the observation of eating, clothing, housing, and transportation, we can know the temperament of each individual on a small scale, and we can express the national character of a country on a large scale. The expression of eating, clothing, housing, and transportation is also the practice of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. (3) Protection is the expression of national unity. However, the work of protection is actually between education and cultivation. If education and cultivation are done well, the people can understand their responsibilities, as well as propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and have a certain discipline and rules in their daily lives, then they will naturally know how to unite and defend themselves. Otherwise, it will not be the case. Therefore, the fundamental method of protection lies in education, and the secondary method lies in strictly observing discipline and obeying orders. The connection between the eight characters is the four characters (common consistency). Today's self-defense is an important fundamental method. If it is not implemented, we can only treat the symptoms. Whether it is the government, the army, the party headquarters, or society, etc., all should strictly follow the eight characters (strictly observe discipline and obey orders) so that they can be united and self-defensive. Speaking of education, cultivation, and protection together means the twelve characters (propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, clothing, food, housing, transportation, common consistency). Doing these twelve characters is the foundation for national revival. However, the implementation of this effect is important in education, that is, as I said just now, those who can understand their own responsibilities, teach these to others, and direct others. From then on, whether it is the party, the government, the army, the society, or the individual, all should pay attention to education anytime and anywhere, and what is especially important is the police and the school, because the police are the teachers of society. Whether society is good or bad depends on how well the police do their job. The school is the teacher of the people. The progress of the people's level depends on education. In addition, everyone should be responsible for common consistency. The foundation of national revival can be laid down, he said. (February 13th)</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway Administration came in a letter, saying: "Recently, the news reported in various newspapers that the Sunjiashan Yuntaishan tunnels on the Longhai Railway were crushed by snow and traffic was blocked is not in line with the facts. After investigation, the mountain tunnel is 291 meters long and is made of extremely hard granite. After a year of work, it was finally tunneled through and the interior was built with concrete, which is very strong. Experts from China and foreign countries have inspected it and believe it is a perfect project. Even if it is bombed with explosives, it can only damage its local parts. How can a few inches of snow crush the entire tunnel? How light is the snow, how heavy is the stone? Those with a little common sense will not believe that a few inches of snow can crush a stone tunnel dozens of meters thick. Hereby, we solemnly state again and again that the mountain tunnel is intact and traffic is unobstructed. The reports in various newspapers are all rumors and inaccuracies. We are deeply afraid that the rumors will become more and more confusing. If there is a transmission of road transportation, we will disclose the truth of the facts so that it can be corrected."</p>
<h3>The Sichuan-Kang Expedition Inspects the Sugar and Salt Industries</h3>
<p>Sugar in Neijiang and Zizhong</p>
<p>Rock Salt in Zigong</p>
<p>Both are declining due to heavy taxes</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: It is more than 1,000 miles from Chongqing to Chengdu. It can be reached by plane in two hours. If you take a long-distance bus, it takes two days to complete the journey because the road is mountainous and winding between the towering peaks and valleys. Neijiang is located between Rong and Yu, and Zigong is 120 miles south of Neijiang. The inspection team departed from Chongqing in the early morning of February 5th, arrived in Neijiang in the evening, set off in a sedan chair to the south at dawn on the 6th, arrived in Zigong at 4:00 p.m., engaged in the inspection of salt wells and fire wells on the 7th, returned to Neijiang on the 8th, and took the bus again on the 9th, arriving in Chengdu at 5:00 p.m., which took five days. The inspection time was only eight hours. The status of the sugar and salt industries is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zigong salt water filtration (bubble slag yellow bucket) (Wang Kaizhenhuan)</p>
<p>Sugar Industry</p>
<p>The sugar in the Neijiang and Zizhong area is made from locally produced sugar cane. The manufacturing method is very simple. First, two iron cylinders are rotated by cattle power. The sugar cane passes through them, and the juice is squeezed out. After accumulating a certain amount of sugar cane juice, lime is added to clarify it, and then it is poured into a pot and boiled to evaporate the water to a considerable concentration. Then it is poured into a tank and allowed to cool, and the sugar is crystallized and precipitated. Then, mud is added to it to separate the sugar from the mother liquor under pressure. Then, the sugar is taken out and exposed in the square to wait for it to dry. Finally, it is packed and shipped out. The equipment used is very simple, and there are many opportunities for microorganisms and dirt to enter the sugar. Therefore, the finished product is yellow and black in color. When drinking it, once dissolved, there are many impurities that settle at the bottom of the container, so the manufacturing method needs to be improved urgently. One more point to note is that the fuel used for boiling sugar is now the remaining sugar cane after squeezing, because the price of coal is high. This remaining sugar cane still contains sugar and has fibers suitable for papermaking. Now it is burned all at once, which is a pity. It is heard that a private company is planning to build a railway from Neijiang through Dengjingguan to Luzhou. If the railway can be completed, the coal needed in Neijiang can be transported, and the sugar produced in Neijiang and the salt produced in Zigong can also be easily transported.</p>
<p>The sugar industry in Neijiang is showing a deteriorating trend due to the impact of economic decline. Last year, the total value of sugar exports was 4,259,000 yuan, and the government collected about 1,300,000 yuan in sugar tax. The amount of tax collected in various places varies and is difficult to count. Approximately, 10,000 catties of white sugar should pay a regular tax of 40 yuan when transported from Neijiang to Chengdu, and the surtax reaches about 300 yuan. Therefore, if the tax amount is not reduced as soon as possible, sugar merchants are at risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Salt Industry</p>
<p>The salt in Zigong is rock salt, located 200 to 300 fathoms underground. There are three levels of salt layers, each about three feet thick. The method of extraction is to first ask the Yin-Yang Fengshui master to determine the location, erect a wooden frame, and use manpower to strike down with an iron pestle weighing more than 400 catties, and then use bamboo pipes and other items to remove stone chips and mud slurry, which takes three years to form a well. Its diameter is less than one foot and its depth is more than 200 fathoms. Sometimes it costs more than 100,000 yuan, but no salt water can be obtained. If there is salt water, then tie a long bamboo tube with an iron wire rope into the well to draw it out. This kind of bamboo tube is about five fathoms long, and each tube of salt water can be boiled into more than 270 catties of salt. Sometimes, if solid salt is encountered, another well must be opened nearby and filled with clean water to dissolve the salt, and then it is extracted. Therefore, the method of using this huge bamboo tube is to use the simplest pulley winch mechanism, driven by manpower or cattle power. Large-scale salt wells also use simple steam engines. The extracted salt water is passed through bamboo pipes and flows into a large iron pot for evaporation to precipitate the salt.</p>
<p>The fuel for boiling salt is natural gas, which is naturally available underground. Wells are dug to allow it to gush out, and it ignites when lit, and it is inexhaustible. Occasionally, when it is insufficient, coal is used to supplement it.</p>
<p>At present, the amount of salt produced is about 3 million dan per year. Calculated at 3 yuan per dan, it is worth about 9.1 million yuan. Recently, many abandoned wells have been reopened, and production is increasing daily. The government collects about 10 million yuan in regular tax annually, and the surtax varies depending on the location and distance, and is impossible to calculate. The assets of the salt merchants are about 12 million yuan for salt shops, 16 million yuan for stove merchants, and 5 million yuan for well merchants, totaling 33 million yuan. When the political situation is stable, all merchants can make profits. There are about 100,000 salt industry workers, and each person can earn more than one dime in wages per day.</p>
<p>The food is supplied by merchants, and Hubei is the largest sales destination. In the past, more than 1.1 million dan could be sold annually, but now the output has increased, but sales have decreased. Last year, it was only one-third of the original number, and this year there is a further reduction trend. The reason is that the tax on Sichuan salt is high, and the tax on Huai salt is low. For example, in Yichang, each dan of Sichuan salt pays 9.4 yuan in regular tax and surtax, while Huai salt only pays 6 yuan. Therefore, the selling price has to be high or low. Approximately, the selling price of Sichuan salt in Yichang is more than 8 yuan per dan, while Huai salt is only about 7 yuan. Due to the dumping of Huai salt, Sichuan salt merchants have been hit extremely hard, and it has affected Sichuan's tax revenue. However, since the cost of Sichuan salt is greater than that of Huai salt, (</p>
<p>It is impossible to reduce prices to compete. If you want to maintain sales of Sichuan salt, on the one hand, the tax authorities should adjust the tax, and on the other hand, the Sichuan salt industry itself should strive to improve production technology in order to reduce costs, or directly find a new use for Sichuan salt in order to solve the problem. Otherwise, with the accumulation of surplus production, it is feared that it will lead to the total collapse of the Sichuan salt industry.</p>
<p>Overall, the salt and sugar industries in Zigong and Neijiang are both natural resources and already have a considerable scale. In recent years, due to high taxes and falling prices, they have been declining day by day, and the future is very dangerous. (Lixing, February 9, from Chengdu)</p>
<h3>The Decline of the Tung Oil Industry in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Most Businesses are Losing Money</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangxi-Guangdong oil industry occupies an important position in commerce. The prosperity or decline of its business is related to the prosperity or decline of the market. Yesterday, people in the industry painfully described the trade situation last year and the main reasons for the sluggish business. They are recorded as follows: (There are more than a dozen oil merchants operating the Jiangxi-Guangdong oil industry in this port, including Jiyingfeng, Heji, Dachangfeng, Qiantai, Qingxiang, Hengda, Yanyuan, Fan Bingji, Yang Chunji, Fengji, and Hengsheng, etc. The western gangs include Liu Tongqing, Xu Rongchang, and Yang Hengyuan, etc. Jiyingfeng is the first to be promoted in the capital and business of Jiangxi-Guangdong industry. The company was founded by Zhang Guanzhi, a native of the county. The capital is more than 200,000 yuan, and it has been open for more than 80 years. In the past years, the operation was quite profitable, but in recent years it has been declining. The three types of oil (skin oil) (Hong oil) (Xiu oil) are transported from Jingzhou and Macheng in Hubei Province. Hong oil and Xiu oil come from Jiangxi Province and Hongjiang skin oil market price. Each dan (100 catties) is currently sold for more than 20 yuan (the price of Hong Xiu oil is the same as skin oil). Although the sales of Hong oil were enthusiastic last year, each dan earned one or two yuan, but the trade of skin oil and Xiu oil declined, and each dan lost three or four yuan. In comparison, although it is clear that there is a profit, after full verification, the original capital is exhausted. Jiyingfeng was hit repeatedly due to huge expenses, and the shareholders were looking forward to it and were unwilling to increase the capital, resulting in a slump. As for the Qingyuanfeng oil company in the western gang, because it only operates Hong oil, it has made a lot of profits. This is the situation of the oil industry's disastrous defeat last year.

<h3>Unable to Bear Debt, He Hanged Himself to Death</h3>
<p>February 13th is the deadline for merchants to settle accounts, and the exchange of funds among the people is concluded on this day. However, this year's Lunar New Year, feeling the decline of the rural economy, all sectors are affected. Chen Zhongxian, a resident of Huayang Bridge, was originally from a well-off family. He suffered losses for years, and was heavily in debt. Over the years, he moved east to make up for the west to maintain his credit. This year, he was unable to find a way to raise money, and he was very worried about the coercion of various creditors and the difficulty of making a living in the future. He disappeared the day before New Year's Eve. His family had planned to temporarily avoid the debt collectors, but on the auspicious morning of New Year's Day, they discovered that Chen Zhongxian had hanged himself in an empty room in the back building. He had a suicide note in his arms, detailing the reasons for his suicide. This is indeed a sacrifice under economic pressure.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Abolished Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>During the abolished Lunar New Year, the county government, the county party headquarters, and the various bureaus and district offices in this county all worked as usual, and the schools were not allowed to ask students for leave. However, the business community still followed the usual practice of closing their doors and resting. The bustling atmosphere of Yue Temple Square was no less than in the past. The Songjiang Grand Theater performed Peking Opera. Song Wei Xiaozhu, merchants Fan Zhao and others organized an entertainment venue with three or four kinds of games to attract tourists. It opened on New Year's Day. Men and women in red and green robes strolled on Songwei Road, with people walking shoulder to shoulder, and the business was booming. Due to the holiday for the printing workers, all newspapers in this county suspended publication for a week starting from the 11th. The county government and the Public Security Bureau, in order to prevent gambling under the pretext of the New Year, have been conducting strict investigations in recent days.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>General Accounting Summary</h3>
<p>According to news following the recent major accounting period in Suzhou, the banking industry, adhering to a conservative approach, has generally avoided losses. However, three banks are preparing to close down due to a lack of interest from silver shareholders to continue operations, with an announcement to be made after the market reopens. In the rice industry, both rice merchants and stores find it difficult to maintain their existing operations, with very few making a profit. In the silk and foreign goods trade, only four or five firms, such as Qian Tai Xiang and Xiang Da Xie Ji, have made profits, with the rest barely covering expenses. Three firms are also preparing to close down. The tea, snack, and confectionery business has appeared to be relatively prosperous in recent years, but only two or three firms, such as Cai Zhi Zhai, are making a profit, with the rest suffering losses. The yarn and satin industry has become like fish stranded in a dried rut, attracting little attention. The iron machinery silk weaving industry is barely managing to maintain its current state.</p>
<p>[P Passenger Suicide by Poison &gt;</p>
<p>A Changshu traveler, Wu Xingwu, aged twenty, arrived at the First Inn outside the Lümen Gate on the tenth. He stayed in room number twenty-one. Until the fifteenth, he left in the morning and returned in the evening, showing no unusual behavior. On the fifteenth, at one PM, the tea server noticed that Wu had not yet risen. He knocked on the door and called out, but received no response, which raised suspicion. He opened the door and found Wu in his last moments, with four letters indicating he had taken poison. He was immediately sent to Su Yong Hospital but passed away on the morning of the sixteenth at two AM, despite the treatment. The four letters were addressed to the news agency and the inn, his mother-in-law, his mother, and his aunt and cousin. The letters revealed that he lived in Shen He Xing winery in Ouhuqutown, Xiaotou village, Changshu. Wu had left school last year but was determined to further his studies. Dissatisfied with his wife, he left home and went to Hangzhou, then Jiaxing, to apply for Xiuzhou Middle School. Unable to pay the tuition, he was granted free admission by the school authorities, but this fell through due to his brother acting as guarantor. Wu’s thwarted ambitions were one of the reasons for his suicide. On the afternoon of the sixteenth, his mother and wife received the news and came to Suzhou, requesting the court to waive the autopsy for a private funeral.</p>
<h3>Lake Tai Salt Smugglers Ambush Tax Police</h3>
<p>Yang Mianyi, captain of the Forty-eighth Team of the tax police stationed at the Great Temple Port salt administration, led three patrol boats on a cruise the other day. In the Kai Xian Gong area of Lake Tai, they suddenly encountered seven boats of salt smugglers who surrounded and attacked the patrol team. The patrol boats were surrounded but resisted fiercely. Fortunately, the nearby water police learned of the situation and, along with the local security corps, rushed to help break the siege. The salt smugglers, seeing the large number of police officers, realized they could not resist and fled. Afterward, the tax police and the Seventh Water Police Team reported the incident to the Civil Affairs Department. Yesterday, the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department to promptly send a team to suppress them.</p>

<h3>Adding a Postal Branch in the West District</h3>
<p>Wu Shuqi, the director of the local postal headquarters, had previously requested the management office at the request of people in the West District to set up a postal branch in the West District. The Ling family residence was found as the site for the bureau, and Ding Zhenya was sent to actively prepare. It was originally scheduled to open on the twentieth of this month. Now it is known that Director Wu, in order to facilitate residents' mailing of letters, specifically ordered the houses to be renovated quickly. It has now been completed, and it officially opened at eight o'clock yesterday morning, with Wu Yiguang being appointed as the branch director and Chen Weifeng as the ticket seller.</p>
<h3>Breaking up a Private Counterfeit Coin Operation</h3>
<p>The county government previously received a secret order from the provincial government, saying that in Wu village near Shitangwan in the sixteenth district of this county, there was a certain family’s house with an underground room, where bandits were privately making counterfeit silver dollars, which were being used in various places, harming commerce. Therefore, the government ordered an immediate and thorough search and arrest. County Magistrate Yan, after receiving the order, immediately sent detectives disguised as cloth sellers to the area to conduct a search. Two major criminals, Gu Fugen and Zhuang Yushan, were caught on the spot, along with ninety-nine counterfeit silver coins and scattered items used to make them. They were all taken to the county and interrogated by Director Yao of the trial division, who ordered them to be detained temporarily. Yesterday, County Magistrate Yan sent a letter with Gu Gengzhuang Yushan and the counterfeit silver coins as evidence to the County Court. After an interrogation by Prosecutor Ren, they were ordered to be detained together pending legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Closes Down, Selling Houses to Pay Debts</h3>
<p>After the Taixin Silk Factory outside the North Gate of Guangqin Road went bankrupt, it owed a huge amount of debt. After mediation by the county government and the county chamber of commerce, most of the debts were reduced and resolved. However, it still owed another company an amount of 12,942.50 yuan for dried cocoons. County Magistrate Yan auctioned off the factory owner Xu Junjie’s houses, and after deducting other debts, the remaining 1,550 yuan was distributed to the dried cocoon company. Yesterday, Chen Zhanru of the county chamber of commerce convened various cocoon companies to distribute the money, calculating that each 100 yuan was only distributed 11.744 yuan.</p>

<h3>Qing-Shanghai Telegraph Direct Line Imminent</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the fact that telegrams from the Jiangbei area to Shanghai and other places had to be transferred from Qingjiang to Zhenjiang before they could be sent to Shanghai, the Ministry of Communications deemed the procedure to be cumbersome and time-consuming because they had to go through several bureaus. Therefore, it was proposed to add a direct line between Qingjiang and Shanghai, and adopt the Western fast machine for speed. The installation began this month. In the future, telegrams sent from Jiangbei to Shanghai and other places will no longer need to be transferred by Zhenjiang, but will be sent directly from Qingjiangpu in Jiangbei.</p>

<h3>Group-Farmer Conflict Results in Bloody Tragedy</h3>
<p>On Lunar New Year's Eve, the security corps of Xingren District, more than twenty miles northeast of the city, was collecting land taxes from the villagers, which led to a conflict at Wu Suo's home. Suddenly, they opened fire and killed Wu Suo, and injured his nineteen-year-old daughter, Miss Jin. The villagers were outraged and gathered over a thousand people to surround and disarm the squad leader Zhang Asong, corpsmen Hua Xiaowen and Liu Jinshan, and tied them to trees. After much mediation, the three men were handed over to the corps headquarters and transferred to the Nantong Court for trial, and the county government is handling the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Land Tax Director Detained</h3>
<p>Gou Zengji, the land tax director of this county, was in charge of collecting new and old land taxes, originally determining that 800,000 yuan would be collected, but by the deadline, only more than 500,000 yuan had been received, resulting in delays in police, education and other important needs. The county government detained the director.</p>

<h3>Yihe Bank Closes</h3>
<p>Since Huikang Hengchang and other banks announced their closure last year, the Yihe Bank in the city and the Fengjing branch suddenly announced their closure due to the impact of the social economy over the years, with a deficit of 380,000. The bank was a major player in the county's banking industry, having been in operation for more than forty years.</p>
<p>Hefei</p>
<h3>Anhui Western Red Party Members Surrender in Droves</h3>
<p>After being wiped out by the National Army, the Red Bandits in western Anhui, between Hefei and Lu'an, took the opportunity to lie dormant among the Red Peasants' Associations (ie. Bare Egg Society) and labor unions at all levels in the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts. The Provincial Party Headquarters, after finding out about this, sent more than ten people to Hefei to carry out indoctrination work in the western villages. Recently, great results have been achieved. More than fifty important members of the Red Peasants' Association and labor unions, such as Ge Jianming and Zhang Jingsi, and thirty or so Communist Party members from the Sanhe area, such as Wang Fabang, all signed confessions on February 8 at the County Party Headquarters, announcing their secession from the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Sun Tonggang Comes to Shanghai to Receive the Plane Donated by Du</h3>
<p>The Reinstallation of Components is Complete</p>
<p>A Ceremony will be Held on Schedule</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, Du Yuesheng, the Chinese director of the French Concession Board of Directors, previously ordered a plane from the German Junkers Aircraft Factory and donated it to Sun Tonggang to encourage his interest in aviation. After the giving and receiving ceremony had been held, due to the heavy fuselage of the plane, it was not suitable for long-distance flights. The factory reinstalled the parts, which took two months to complete. After hearing the news in Jinan, Sun Tonggang left Jinan last Wednesday and came to Shanghai. Du Yuesheng accompanied Sun to the Hongqiao Aircraft Factory to inspect it. Then Sun boarded the plane and circled the sky, which was quite satisfactory. It is heard that another giving and receiving ceremony will be held in the coming days, and Sun will take the plane donated by Du back to Jinan.</p>
<h3>Italian Aviator Pei Nadi to Perform on Clear Days Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Italian famous aviator Pei Nadi drove his plane at the Hongqiao Airport the other afternoon for an informal performance. At that time, there were few spectators on the field. They looked up at Pei's plane and performed various dangerous flights, all of which made them terrified and tongue-tied. After the performance, he landed leisurely and took Gorte into the air for a short time. If the weather is clear on Saturdays and Sundays or Sunday afternoons, Pei plans to continue to perform non-public performances at the Hongqiao Airport for government officials to see, and then choose a date for a public performance to show off his unique skills. Aviation enthusiasts must take the time to go and see it to feast their eyes. The plane that Pei is driving is manufactured by the Italian Caproni Company and is equipped with a 350-horsepower engine that can reach a speed of 255 kilometers per hour.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Route to Resume Next Week, Preparing for Test Flight of Sichuan-Kangding Route</h3>
<p>Southwest Guizhou Route Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Shanghai-Guangdong line will resume two round-trip flights each week, north and south, starting next week due to the completion of the new aircraft installation. The Sichuan-Kangding line from Chengdu to Kangding is preparing for a test flight. The Southwest Guizhou line has submitted the opinion of opening to the ministry for approval after the test flight. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Route Resumes Schedule</p>
<p>After the opening of the Shanghai-Guangdong line, it was originally scheduled to have two northbound and two southbound flights per week. In late November of last year, after Flight 16 encountered fog and crashed in Zhoushan, only Flight 17 flew back and forth between Shanghai and Guangdong. Occasionally, when the weather was bad and the flight was blocked, flights were often delayed for days. Therefore, the schedule was changed to once a week, and new aircraft were ordered from the United States. The new aircraft arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and have been assembled. It is now scheduled to resume the original schedule starting next week. In addition to the southbound flight on the 20th (Tuesday), the southbound flight on the 23rd (Friday) will also resume operation.</p>
<p>Ordered to Test Fly Sichuan-Kangding</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has ordered CNAC to prepare an airline because the situation in the border areas of Kangding and Tibet is isolated from the central government due to transportation difficulties. First, it was wired to Liu Wenhui, the Director of Border Defense in Sichuan and Kangding, to arrange airfields in Kangding (Dajianlu) and Baan for the aircraft to land. Liu's reply has been received, and the airfield has been arranged. The Ministry of Communications specifically ordered the company to prepare for a test flight. After receiving the order, the company is preparing for a test flight, first from Chengdu to Kangding, and then decide whether to fly further west depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Opinion on Opening Guizhou</p>
<p>The purpose of the company's test flight of the southwestern route the other day was to prepare for the opening of a route to connect the traffic between Guizhou. The results of the test flight showed that the route passes through many high mountains. The horsepower of the aircraft currently used is too small to fly over. If it is necessary to open it, aircraft with greater horsepower must be purchased. In addition, the climate in the Hengduan Mountains in the southwest often changes. Wireless radio stations must be set up in many places to report the climate so that the flight can be safe. The above opinions have been reported to the Ministry of Communications for review and decision. Whether to open the flight route or not is still to be decided by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Jiangfeng Aircraft Test Flight Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiangfeng training aircraft, built by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, was originally intended for water flight. By order of the Navy Department, it was converted to land wheels. It has now been completed, and yesterday afternoon, Xu Chengqi, an aviation instructor on the Ninghai cruiser, test-flew it in the sky over Longhua. It circled the city's sky several times, with excellent results.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Notice Banning the Import of Agricultural Pests and Diseases</h3>
<p>Imports Must be Certified by the Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Customs yesterday issued a notice saying, “The government order has been promulgated to prohibit the import of agricultural pests and diseases. From the date of promulgation until another notice is issued, all living disease seedlings, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and insects that harm agriculture imported from foreign countries are temporarily limited to the Shanghai port. Each import must have a special permit from the Ministry of Industry and be certified by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau before it can be released." Therefore, compliance is required. All merchants should be aware of this and are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Social Bureau Organizes an Agricultural Products Exhibition in this City</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Held in Various Rural Areas Starting on the 20th of this Month</p>
<p>Inviting Agricultural Experts to Lecture on Improving Agricultural Affairs</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the decline of the rural areas in this city, the main reason is that the general farmers stick to old methods and do not think about improvement, resulting in a decrease in economic income, and the farmers' livelihood is in a desperate situation. For guidance and promotion, a large number of agricultural products have been collected from various places and are scheduled to be held in various rural areas of the city in rotation starting on the 20th of this month. Famous people will also be invited to give lectures in various rural areas to promote it. The exhibition schedule for each district has also been specified: (1) Lihang, 20th and 21st for two days; Yangsi, 25th and 26th for two days; Caohe, 30th and 31st; Yinhang, 4th and 5th of February; Zhenru, 10th and 11th for two days.</p>

<p>Collecting Gifts</p>
<p>The Social Bureau sent a letter to major domestic product manufacturers in this city yesterday to collect gifts. The original text said: "Dear Sir, this bureau is in charge of agricultural and industrial administration and has the responsibility to guide farmers to improve agricultural affairs. It has been approved by the municipal government to hold a mobile agricultural product exhibition in this city. It is scheduled to be held in Lihang, Yangsi, Caojing, Zhenru, Yinhang and other districts starting on the 20th of this month. In order to encourage farmers to participate, we plan to prepare small gifts to increase interest. We have always admired the promotion of domestic products and spared no effort. We have always been enthusiastic about the farmers' movement. Therefore, we have sent a special letter. If you can donate practical items for farmers to promote publicity, it would be a great honor. Please reply, Social Bureau.</p>

<h3>Yu Youren's Recent Illness</h3>
<p>Recovery after Further Rest</p>
<p>Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, suffered a stroke in Shanghai and has not fully recovered. According to his family members who spoke to reporters from the New Sound News Agency yesterday morning, Yu has been ill since the 8th and has been treated by Dr. Lu Zhong'an for several days. His spirit, diet, daily life, and speech have gradually returned to normal. Only his mouth is crooked, his eyes sometimes shed tears, and his head is slightly numb. He will recover after further rest. He has requested an additional week of leave from the central government for rest. As for Yu's trip to Weihaiwei, it was proposed by Chu Minyi, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, when he met Yu in Shanghai. Yu himself has not made this decision. After Secretary Chu announced this to the press, the Weihaiwei Public Hospital and other circles sent telegrams to Yu welcoming him. However, Yu has replied with thanks because he has not made this decision, and said that he would send another telegram to notify them if he decided to go to Weihai. In addition, Zhang Xueliang, the newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Three Provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei for the Suppression of Bandits, personally visited Yu at Jing'an Villa the other day to inquire about his illness and left after talking for about 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiliang's Illness Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, contracted a serious illness in Fujian the other day. He took the Hai Rong warship to Shanghai to be admitted to Renji Hospital for treatment. Chen's illness has gradually recovered in recent days, but he has not yet received guests. At 10:30 yesterday morning, Lin Guogeng, the Commander of Xiamen Naval Port, personally went to Renji Hospital to visit, and only met with Dr. Chen Cheng to inquire about Commander Chen's condition, and then left. According to Dr. Chen Cheng, who spoke to the reporter of the Daily News, the results of the joint diagnosis by the doctors of the hospital confirmed that Commander Chen's illness was not pneumonia, but kidney disease with a large number of stones, which was caused by overwork. Therefore, when it occurred, it came suddenly. After conditioning, it has gradually recovered, with the heat dropping to 98, the pulse to 78, and the breathing to 20. Everything is like a normal person, but the spirit is slightly tired, he likes to sleep, and he can sometimes sit up. He often eats porridge. Surgery seems to be required for the kidney, but it must wait until his body recovers to a considerable degree of health and his spirit is slightly stronger before it can be performed.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang's Funeral on the 19th</h3>
<p>Condolences will be Received at the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road Tomorrow</p>
<p>This Time Yang's Funeral Procession is Extremely Grand</p>
<p>Admiral Yang Shuzhuang passed away in Shanghai in the middle of last month. The National Government issued an order for a public funeral. The coffin is parked in the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. The Yang family funeral home has chosen to receive condolences at the Jade Buddha Temple at the intersection of Gordon Road and Binlang Road tomorrow (18th). The funeral will be held the day after tomorrow (19th), and the coffin will be returned to Yang’s ancestral home in Fujian. It is heard that the funeral ceremony will be very grand this time. However, since the Universal Funeral Home is in the Public Concession, and the Concession authorities have recently banned funeral processions of more than 300 people, Yang, although he was a senior official of the National Government during his lifetime, is restricted by unequal treaties. His large procession cannot pass through the Concession. The coffin was specifically transported to the Flour Exchange on Xin Kai River as the starting point. Navy Minister Chen Shaoqing is scheduled to come to Shanghai tomorrow to help with the funeral. The National Government's funeral order has also been transferred from the Navy Department. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Funeral Order</p>
<p>In accordance with the Executive Yuan's order: (In accordance with the National Government's Order No. 73: (For the purpose of ordering matters, according to the Civil Affairs Department of this government: (According to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee's letter: (Recently, the Executive Yuan's letter was approved, because the Fujian Provincial Government and the Navy Department jointly requested to follow the precedent of Tian Tong's public funeral, and to approve the public funeral of the deceased Admiral Yang Shuzhuang of Fujian Province. After the proposal was passed at the 144th meeting, please transfer it to Chen Heban and so on. Approved, Chen Feng Chang Wu Yuan Committee approved, (According to the letter, the National Government transferred it to the Fujian Provincial Government to host the public funeral,) A copy of the original letter is enclosed, hoping you will check and forward it for handling)) and so on, according to this, it should be handled immediately. In addition to ordering the office to reply, the relevant department should be instructed to follow up on this order).

<h3>Mr. Lu Dongsheng, a Chinese National, Invents "Electric Essence" After Ten Years of Research</h3>
<p>Its Industrial Efficiency is Tremendously Greater, Far Exceeding That of Kerosene</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: Mr. Lu Dongsheng, a Chinese national, comes from a humble family but possesses great ambition. He has dedicated himself to the study of industry for over a decade, like a single day. After graduating from a technical college, he immediately took a key position in the Shanghai Municipal Council for three years, mastering machinery with exceptional skill. To realize his ambitions, he established an electric welding factory in Hongkou. However, all the necessary raw materials had to be imported, which he considered a great humiliation. Also, recognizing that our country's fuel for lighting relied entirely on imported kerosene, resulting in a great outflow of money, he resolved to travel abroad to Germany last year to conduct on-site industrial research for further study. After returning to China, he based on his experience and through tireless research, invented a type of calcium carbide "electric essence" specifically for welding copper, iron, and machine parts, as well as for military explosives and smokeless gunpowder. It can also be used to light various "electric essence" lamps and stoves, aiming to stem the outflow of wealth. It is truly a new invention in the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Great Efficiency</p>
<p>According to investigations by a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, this "electric essence" is remarkably efficient. The raw materials are entirely domestically produced. Besides enabling electric welding factories to avoid purchasing imported materials, it can also be used to light lamps and stoves, with efficiency far exceeding that of kerosene. It not only saves money but is also hygienic and safe. Using "electric essence" for ignition produces neither gas nor foul odors. Using "electric essence" to light lamps and stoves providing 400 candlepower costs only ten cents per three hours, which is one-third cheaper than kerosene. It is predicted that after "electric essence" becomes popular, the sales of kerosene will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Establishing Own Factory</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu invented "electric essence," he established the Huaming "Electric Essence" Factory at No. 51 Nanjing Road, Great China Arcade, vigorously promoting it. Electric welding factories are enthusiastically purchasing this raw material. He also manufactures various "electric essence" lamps for testing and lighting by various sectors, with particularly low prices, far exceeding those of gasoline lamps on the market. Recently, he is planning to manufacture dozens of types, including: (1) fishing lamps, (2) fire fighting lamps, (3) cooking lamps, (4) silkworm rearing lamps, (5) steamship red and green lights, (6) security lamps, (7) ocean exploration lamps, and so on.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Succeeds Zhou Xiangxian as Director of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Handover Completed; Will Inspect Work Sites Within Days</p>
<p>Much of the Original Construction Damaged by Thawing River Ice</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Xiangxian, the Director of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee of the National Government, oversaw the project of damming the breaches in the Yellow River. Due to limited funds and the immense scale of the project, he was extremely overworked. Moreover, he also held the positions of Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee and Director of the Lushan Administration, making his schedule very busy. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government also suggested that Zhou resume his position as the Mayor of Hangzhou. Zhou requested Mr. Kong Xiangxi, the Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, to resign from his concurrent position as the Director of the Work Relief Group, which was approved. The committee then appointed Mr. Kong Xiangrong, the General Inspector of the committee, to succeed him. The handover has already taken place. Recently, with the thawing of the Yellow River, much of the original construction was damaged by river ice. Mr. Kong plans to inspect the work sites in Changyuan within days. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handover Procedures</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou and Mr. Kong completed the handover at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the committee's office on the Bund. Many of the key staff within the Work Relief Group were transferred from the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee. They all submitted their resignations before the handover, which was approved by former Director Zhou. After Mr. Kong took office, he reassigned them separately. The work site staff will all remain as usual.</p>
<p>Mr. Kong's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangrong is the younger brother of Mr. Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. He previously served as the Director of the Yongding River Project Bureau, having experience in river works. In 1928, he served as a member and concurrently the Director of General Affairs of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee, possessing rich experience in river management projects. At this critical moment in the project, he resolutely took on the responsibility, and he will surely be able to quickly close the breaches and save the victims.</p>
<h3>Fujian Lacquerware Plans to Continue Participation in the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<p>Intends to Create Statues of World Celebrities</p>
<p>Last year, the Chicago Exposition was held. Although our government canceled its participation due to the national crisis, it still allowed businesses to freely participate in the competition. The exhibits that did participate were exceptionally exquisite and received high praise from people of various countries. For example, Fujian lacquerware not only won a first-class award but was also completely sold out, setting a new record for past competitions. The exposition organizers, encouraged by last year's success, plan to continue holding the exposition this year for another year. The Chinese Products Participation Association for the Chicago Exposition has decided to continue its participation. Mr. Dong Kunpan, the Fujian products representative, previously went to the United States to conduct research. Based on the experience gained on-site, he plans to divide this year's lacquerware exhibits into two categories. One category will be artistic, practical, and aesthetically pleasing items, including statues of world celebrities, as well as famous birds and exotic animals, models of great architecture, and rare flowers and plants, made of silk and fine lacquer. They can be hung or displayed, providing Westerners with aesthetic enjoyment. The value will also be very low, giving ordinary people the opportunity to purchase them. The other category will be daily necessities, including small tables, chairs, tea tables, four-tiered tables, electric lamp stands, sugar boxes, powder boxes, cigarette cases, and so on, which Westerners are happy to purchase. The various styles will be further improved to compete with the products of our eastern neighbors in the market. In addition, the Boston department store in Chicago, USA, has established a section for Chinese goods, specifically for selling Chinese products, serving as a venue for direct trade in the future. When sales are strong, a dedicated pavilion should be established to gradually expand. Mr. Dong discussed this year's participation plan with artist Jiang Xiaojian yesterday. The plan to create statues of world celebrities will be guided by Mr. Jiang, to serve as exhibits for 1934. Mr. Jiang will also assist in improving products for foreign trade. It is reported that Mr. Jiang has expressed his support, hoping to win honor for the country and save the declining Chinese lacquer industry. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Taishun Wheel Carries the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Soldiers Have Been Dispersed Separately</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that after the Fujian Incident was suppressed, the 19th Route Army was reorganized and demobilized by the authorities. Most of the troops were from Guangdong and were provided with funds to return to Guangdong. However, there were more than 300 soldiers from the 60th Division who were originally from the Yangtze River region. Therefore, the military authorities specifically ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Taishun Wheel to transport them from Fujian to Shanghai. It arrived at this port at around 6:00 AM on the 12th of this month and berthed at the Ning-Shao Wharf on the Bund. Upon receiving the report, Yang Hu, the Director of the Shanghai Security Department, immediately dispatched a battalion of security guards to guard the area around the Ning-Shao Wharf. All soldiers of the 19th Route Army, except for junior officers who were allowed to disembark, were not allowed to leave the wharf. A squad of Zhejiang Security Department soldiers escorting the ship also disembarked and stationed there. This group of about 300 soldiers of the 19th Route Army, with all their firearms confiscated, were still wearing their old uniforms and were scattered around the Ning-Shao Wharf area, without any transgressions. According to the announcement by the local authorities, these soldiers have been separately dispersed by the Public Security Bureau, which provided them with train or boat tickets to return to their hometowns free of charge. The junior officers of the 19th Route Army who came to Shanghai on the ship have been transferred to Beijing for training at the Luoyang Military Training School, so they can further their education.</p>

<h3>The North-China Daily News Comments on the Achievements of China's Salt Administration</h3>
<p>Attributes Success to Mr. Chu Ting-chi</p>
<p>The editorial of the North-China Daily News on February 1 stated: This newspaper commented on the efforts to improve the salt administration in last week's editorial. This newspaper is now publishing a special article in another column of today's newspaper for readers to enjoy. The article provides a detailed description of the recent reforms in China's salt administration and the increase in tax revenue. The most noteworthy aspect of the reforms is the emphasis on the training of personnel by Mr. Chu Ting-chi, the Director-General of the Salt Administration Inspectorate. Chinese personnel are gradually filling higher positions in the inspectorate, and the foreign employees are experienced specialists hired to improve the accounting system. The results have been remarkable so far, which is commendable. It is expected that the Chinese government will support these bold efforts. Since Mr. Chu Ting-chi took over as the Director-General of the Salt Administration Inspectorate in 1929, he has worked hard to improve the administration and increase tax revenue. Not only is this the most progressive period in the inspectorate's more than 20-year history, but it is also an unprecedented achievement in China's national financial history. First, regarding tax revenue, the annual salt tax in 1913 was only 19 million yuan. Since 1929, after eliminating corruption, making great efforts to reform, and implementing the latest accounting system, the annual tax revenue in 1931 was more than 93 million yuan, in 1932 it was more than 97 million yuan, and in 1933 it increased to more than 156.5 million yuan. The surcharges on salt levied in each province are not included in this figure. Mr. Chu's great achievements are evident here. Regarding expenses, due to the implementation of austerity policies, they have decreased year by year. In 1931, 8.4 million yuan were still needed, but in 1933, they had decreased to more than 7.3 million yuan. Mr. Chu is good at selecting and employing talent. In recent years, the inspectorate has successively selected experienced and capable Chinese officials to fill important positions. Foreign employees with special talents are responsible for planning, budgeting, finance, accounting, and other aspects. He has also improved the quality of salt to benefit the people's diet, streamlined transportation to benefit merchants, and encouraged official sales to increase tax revenue. All of these factors have contributed to the increase in tax revenue. Although the salt tax of more than 30 million yuan from the three northeastern provinces has been lost, it cannot diminish his achievements. China's salt administration is divided into three parts: administration, inspection, and anti-smuggling. Since 1929, the directors of the salt transport and marketing bureaus, and the commanders of the anti-smuggling battalions in the administrative aspect, have been concurrently held by the regional heads of the inspectorate in eight provinces. Due to the concentration of powers, their tax revenue was more than 93.44 million yuan in 1931, more than 97 million yuan in 1932, and more than 113 million yuan in 1933. In percentage terms, the tax revenue in 1932 increased by 4% compared to 1931, and the tax revenue in 1933 increased by 21.7% compared to 1932. During the same period, the tax revenue in another eight provinces, where administration and inspection were separated, only increased by 1.3% in 1932 compared to 1931, and by 2% in 1933 compared to 1932. Although there was an increase, the difference was huge. This alone shows the efforts of the inspectorate. The former anti-smuggling battalions were reorganized into tax police, and after being effectively reorganized under the jurisdiction of the inspectorate, the management of all salt fields, the improvement of salt storage and transportation, and the centralized procurement of supplies for the tax police have all achieved results. The achievements are obvious and need no further discussion. The Salt Administration Inspectorate is a purely financial institution of the Chinese government, unlike the Customs and Postal Service. The salt administration only uses salt tax as a guarantee for certain foreign debts, and has less contact with foreigners than the Postal Service and Customs. The inspectorate has published many publications over the years under the direction of Mr. Chu, mostly in Chinese, although some have been translated into Western languages. Foreigners, because it is not directly related to them, do not pay much attention to it, so few people know about it. However, its reputation abroad for guaranteeing foreign debt is growing. Before 1929, the central government's orders were not followed, and the provinces acted on their own. When foreign debts were due, they were not paid on time. In that year, the former Minister Song published a declaration stipulating that each province should share the burden of repaying the debts. Mr. Chu implemented it with great effort, enabling the branch inspectorates in each province to pay the allotted amount on time, and the overdue interest on the British and French loans, the Crisp loan, and the Huguang Railway loan were gradually repaid. His achievements are admirable. Those with insight believe that Mr. Chu's great achievements and the full expression of his intelligence and talent are due to the former Minister Song's appropriate use of his talents and the current Minister Kong's care and maintenance. This is the theory of tracing the origin to the source. If fundamental plans such as equalizing tax rates and implementing free trade are not opposed by the local governments and are not hindered by geographical conditions, then Mr. Chu's achievements will be even more immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section of the Two Railways Negotiate Ten Outstanding Cases with the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>If No Reply is Received by the Deadline, There Is Fear of Unrest</p>
<p>If Action Is Taken, Responsibility Will Not Be Assumed</p>
<p>The Two Railways Unions Have Forwarded the Cases to the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Chen Bohua and others, the directors of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Unions, have received reports that the workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section are demanding wage increases and the resolution of various outstanding cases. Since the authorities of the two railways have not replied by the deadline, it is reported that turmoil may arise. Therefore, the original report has been forwarded to the Railway Bureau to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The content of the original report and the demands are listed below:</p>
<p>Original Report of the Union</p>
<p>The union's original report states: The reason for the report is that the Shanghai-Hangzhou section's sub-office reported on the 16th of this month that several important outstanding cases have not been resolved. Therefore, on the 30th of last month, representatives were sent to Shanghai to negotiate with the bureau. The bureau asked Director Chen Bohua to guide the negotiation with the Railway Bureau, and Director-General Yuan received them, promising that there would be a reasonable reply at 8:00 AM the next day. However, two weeks have passed since then, and there is still no reply. The members of the sub-office are deeply disappointed and extremely anxious, and have repeatedly urged for a reply. Therefore, the 18th meeting of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, held at the Jiaxing station on February 15, resolved that the board of directors should forward the report to the Railway Bureau and provide a reply within seven days. The minutes are on file. We are submitting this report along with the case details, asking the bureau to forward it to the Railway Bureau for reply. Otherwise, we are afraid that the members will misunderstand the situation and take other actions, and the sub-office will not be able to bear the responsibility. We respectfully ask the bureau to review and implement the report and not ignore it to avoid future troubles. We are reporting this to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>Content of Demands</p>
<p>The content of the demands of the workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section includes ten items. According to Huadong News Agency reporter, the ten items are as follows: (1) Clarify the method for distributing annual salary increases; (2) Outdoor staff of the traffic department should be entitled to rest on various national holidays and receive substitute salary if they work; (3) Employees should not be allowed to apply for sick leave after the fact; (4) The year-end bonus should be based on actual profits; (5) The annual salary increase for the second half of 1933 was delayed, affecting the year-end bonus of the employees who should have received the increase; (6) The punishment of Ye Fusheng, Zhang Jinhua, and Zhou Lant ing, who are in charge of cleaning cars, was unfair because vehicles were burned at the gate station; (7) The salary reduction of station manager Cao Zhechou has not been restored after more than a year. According to the usual practice, the original salary can be restored six months after the punishment if there is no fault; (8) Yao Dexing, a freight clerk, and Shen Weibin, a station manager, were each given a demerit, but each received a merit during the "January 28th Incident," so they did not receive an annual salary increase; (9) Zheng Guoliangchou and Guangjun have been promoted and should be given a salary increase according to the grace case; (10) Sun Yixian, Mo Jingneng, and others, station managers, have each received a minor demerit and should still be given an annual salary increase according to the usual practice.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Xinwei Relief Association Requests Medicine by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association received an urgent telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association yesterday, stating that throat diseases, coughs, bone pain, and alternating chills and fever have recently occurred in the Hebei area of the province and in counties inside and outside the province. The disease spreads very quickly, and there is also an epidemic in the western counties. Please allocate Shen Gong Pujishui, Wanjinyou, and emergency medicines for various diseases for emergency use. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately allocated 100 bottles of throat-blowing powder, 200 packets of cough and fever medicine, 300 bottles of Pujishui, and 200 boxes of Wanjinyou, and forwarded them to the provincial Relief Association yesterday for distribution.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Expands the Municipal South Clinic</h3>
<p>Moved to the Former Site of the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday</p>
<p>The Health Bureau, recognizing that the Municipal South Clinic on Penglai Road has been very popular since its establishment, and the original building is insufficient, moved to the former site of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters on Fangxie Road, Xilin Road, yesterday. It has started providing services at the new location today and has purchased additional medical equipment to expand medical services to benefit the public.</p>
<h3>Continuing the Gruel Distribution at the Zhabei Gruel Kitchen, Extending the Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Association has been operating a winter relief gruel kitchen at the second gruel kitchen on Liuying Road for over a month. The daily demand for rice to feed the poor is enormous. Furthermore, rice tickets were distributed at the end of winter, both at the gruel kitchen and within the association, totaling over 300 *shi* (bushels). This clearly indicates the large number of impoverished people in Zhabei and the difficulty of their livelihoods, which is truly pitiable. It is reported that the directors and Director Wang of the association are enthusiastically raising funds for further action and will continue the spring relief efforts starting on the 17th of this month. The general poor population is very grateful to hear that they will be fed again.</p>
<h3>Disaster Caused by Striking Gongs and Drums for the Abolished Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>At the start of the abolished lunar year, a group of ignorant workers and idlers formed a band, carrying gongs, drums, and other musical instruments, and striking them along the streets. Their intention was nothing more than to celebrate the New Year. Yesterday afternoon, around 6:00 PM, more than ten workers from the Hongmu Gang, including Chen A'gen and Gao Zhaosheng, were striking gongs, drums, and cymbals in the Fumin Road area. About twenty ruffians, including Yu Jie and Wang Jingen, stopped Chen A'gen and his group, claiming that celebrating the abolished lunar New Year was inappropriate and using this as an excuse to extort money. When Chen and his companions refused, a fight broke out. As a result, Chen and the others were injured, and Yu Jie and his gang snatched away their gongs, drums, felt hats, wallets, and silver dollars. Subsequently, the police arrived and arrested Yu Jie and Wang Jingen, along with the plaintiffs, Chen A'gen, and others. All were taken to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. After questioning, Director Liu determined that they were guilty of inciting a crowd to commit robbery and ordered them to be handed over to the Bureau of Justice for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Airline Company Dispatches Special Plane to Distribute Aviation Lottery Tickets and Leaflets</h3>
<p>According to news from the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office on Avenue Edward VII, the construction lottery has been issued for four periods, and sales for this period are the strongest. Recently, the China National Aviation Corporation, in order to assist in the lottery's promotion, has specially dispatched a plane to distribute construction lottery leaflets in Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hankou, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Jinan, Chongqing, and other places on the 17th, 18th, 21st, and 22nd of this month, in order to attract the attention of the public in various regions. It is anticipated that the sales of the lottery tickets will be even more prosperous, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Xun Huisheng's Grand Appearance on Stage</h3>
<p>The famous actor Xun Huisheng was engaged to go south at the end of last year and performed at the Tianchan Stage on the abolished lunar New Year's Day. For the past three days, the theater has been completely sold out, earning over ten thousand dollars. Tonight, he will perform his masterpiece, the complete *Thirteen Sisters*.

<h3>Robber Hides in Rice Sack</h3>
<p>*Xiechangde* Apprentice Shouts for Help</p>
<p>Gun and Bullets Seized</p>
<p>The main store of *Xiechangde*, located at number 1104, north end of the New Rubbish Bridge in the International Settlement, was busy at 11:55 AM the day before yesterday (the 13th) when suddenly a robber snuck into the store upstairs and hid inside a rice sack. When apprentice Yao Xuechun (14 years old, from Jiading) was ordered by the store employees to bring four hundred silver dollars to the accounting room upstairs for storage, the robber suddenly pulled out a pistol, forbidding him to make a sound, and snatched three hundred dollars from the four hundred dollars held by the apprentice. He then went downstairs to escape. The apprentice chased after him and shouted for a robber. The robber fled west along the Suzhou Creek into the Chinese territory. The store employees blew whistles and gave chase. The robber turned north into Manchuria Road, where police officers Yu Qingjiang and Wang Jingyun, numbers 21 and 23 from the Wuzhen Road branch of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, blocked his path. The robber fired the pistol several times, but it misfired. The police officers then tackled him, seizing a six-inch Browning pistol, serial number 88121, containing seven live rounds. After taking him to the police station, they found the original stolen three hundred silver dollars on the robber's person. He confessed that his name was Sun Lesheng, 21 years old, from Yancheng, residing at number 53 Guoqing Road. Inspector Chen Xiuli, along with police chiefs Hao Likai and Hu Yao, rushed to the scene and arrested Sun Hegao upstairs. According to the landlord, he is Sun Rongsheng's uncle. He was also taken to the police station and transferred to the Fourth District. It is reported that the case has now been taken over by the Haining Road Police Station, who have taken the robber, the pistol, the seven bullets, and the three hundred silver dollars for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Commits Suicide by Opium</h3>
<p>Wang Yinggen's Body Claimed by Father</p>
<p>Yu Zhiting, from Jiaxing, runs the Wanfeng Chopping Block Workshop at number 499 Fangbang Road. He employed apprentice Wang Yinggen (21 years old, also from Jiaxing) for five years. He had already completed his apprenticeship. At the end of the abolished lunar year, Yu Zhiting, seeing that the business was not thriving and having four employees, decided to reduce expenses by laying off Wang Yinggen, telling him to find his own livelihood. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, after the other employees got up, they went to wake Wang Yinggen. He was lying covered by his blanket, and they called him but he did not respond. They lifted the blanket and saw that he was barely breathing. The shop was greatly alarmed and examined him more closely. They found opium stains on his clothes and realized he had taken poison. They immediately sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. By the time he arrived at the hospital, his expression had changed, and he was about to die. Doctors determined that he had taken poison too long ago and could not be saved. He soon died. The body was taken to the Local Court and placed beside the wall in front of the court. Yu Zhiting summoned the deceased's father, Wang Xianglin, and together they reported to the court, requesting an autopsy. Wang Xianglin claimed that he was 41 years old and worked at the Wanchangxiang Chopping Block Workshop in the Hujia Muqiao area of Zhabei. He had one son and two daughters, the deceased being his son. Wang Yinggen was 21 years old and had committed suicide by taking poison. It was no one's fault. He had met with him last night, and after a brief chat in the shop, Wang Yinggen had seen him out. He had planned to go to the Great World amusement center, but because it was late, he told him to return to the shop, and he went to Zhabei. He did not know why he committed suicide. Yu Zhiting said that the deceased had seen his father out and then gone upstairs to write a letter, then went out to mail the letter, and soon returned to sleep. However, he often went out and returned late at night, ordering the apprentice to open the door and telling him not to make a sound. If he committed suicide because of financial problems, he still had six silver dollars on him. There might be other hidden reasons, but he did not know. Prosecutor Wu Deyi held a preliminary hearing and then, together with examiner Xuan Zhiming, went to the iron gate on the west side of the court to examine the body. It was determined that Wang Yinggen had died from taking poison before death. A form was filled out, and it was ordered that the body be coffined by the deceased's father, Wang Xianglin, to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Remaining Fugitives in Rugao Kidnapping Case Continued to Be Arrested</h3>
<p>Lu Zicai, 28 years old, head of the 14th District Defense Corps in Rugao County, Jiangbei, residing at number 41 Yingfeng Lane, had his five-year-old beloved son, Zhongbao, kidnapped by bandits and hidden away on the 28th day of the third month of the abolished lunar calendar last year. A huge ransom was demanded for his release. Just days ago, Lu received a letter, agreeing to meet in Shanghai on the 10th of this month at the Wuling Apartment on Rue Molière in the French Concession to negotiate the ransom. Lu came to Shanghai, and the French Police Department, led by Inspector Jin Jiu, along with special agents, rushed to the Wuling Apartment at 10:00 AM on the 10th and arrested five bandits from Jiangbei: Shao Jinlan, Yan Changcai, Gong Zhihua, Yan Shoucai, and Yang Shoufu, and took them to the police station. They also found the kidnapped boy, Lu Zhongbao, in the back building of number 5 Fuanfang on Minli Road in Zhabei, and arrested Wang Xu, an old woman from Jiangbei guarding the boy, and Deng Xiaoyun. The details of their detention in the Public Security Bureau have already been reported. Subsequently, the French Police Department sent the five bandits, including Shao, to the Second Special District Court and requested a three-week postponement for further investigation. The judge granted the request and ordered a postponement until the 26th for the trial. The police department requested and obtained permission from the court to send detectives to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Wang Xu and Deng Xiaoyun, who were being held in custody, to the court and requested that their cases be combined with the case of Shao Jinlan and others. A major fugitive who had escaped at the time, namely Deng Xiaoyun's husband, Li Yaozhou, who worked in the Water Police, was arrested by detectives from the Second District Public Security Bureau of Ximen. A letter of appointment from the Water Police was found on his person and he was taken into custody. The French Police Department requested the Second Special District Court to send detectives to bring him to the court and requested that he also be detained and his case be combined with the others.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shipping Operations of Swire and Four Other Companies in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Total freight revenue of 710,000 yuan</p>
<p>A decrease of over 80,000 yuan compared to the previous year</p>
<p>Last year, the domestic and international river and sea shipping industries were affected by the commercial depression, and few made profits, while most suffered losses. The three major shipping companies in Shanghai (China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Swire, and Jardine Matheson) did not make a profit last year. Although the shipping division of China Merchants had an income of over six million yuan last year, the debt was too large, and it could only barely cover expenses. Swire and Jardine Matheson had to suffer losses. As for the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line (Swire, China Merchants, Ning Shao, and Sanbei), since the implementation of cooperation last year, transportation has been open and fares have been shared. In the face of last year's industry decline, it was still able to make a profit, which was truly unexpected. The annual overview of the shipping industry on this line is reported below, which is sufficient to show the benefits of cooperation among the same industry and the harm of competitive jealousy.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Open Approach</h3>
<p>For many years, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been subject to excessive competition among various companies, resulting in excessively low prices. In fact, this only benefited the customers and was harmful and unprofitable for the shipping companies. As a result, Swire and other companies initiated open operations for the four companies. The annual freight revenue for imports and exports is calculated as 80%, which is distributed among the four companies according to the tonnage of the ships, determining the amount of money to be allocated. Each company exchanges and reviews the manifest of goods transported daily. Freight rates are in accordance with the set prices, and no private discounts are allowed, fundamentally eliminating competition. This has been implemented for many years. At the end of each year, the total operating accounts of each company are settled, and the surplus companies allocate funds to the deficit ships. After implementation, there have been surpluses every year.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Sees Improvement Last Year</h3>
<p>The import and export business of China Merchants and Sanbei's Ningbo ships has always been inferior to that of Swire and Ning Shao. At the end of each year, the summary invariably shows that Swire and other companies allocate funds to provide assistance. In the year before last, China Merchants' new *Jiangtian* ship still received over 10,000 yuan, and Sanbei received about 20,000 yuan. By last year, Sanbei's *Ningxing* ship had the smallest business among the four companies, and at the end of the year, it still had to allocate over 20,000 yuan. China Merchants' new *Jiangtian*, on the other hand, suddenly improved, breaking the previous operating record. In addition to being fully covered, it was able to allocate over 10,000 yuan. This was the most developed year in the history of the bureau's Shanghai-Ningbo shipping operations. Last year, the total income from freight and passenger tickets of the new *Jiangtian* ship exceeded 320,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Total Freight Revenue of Four Ships</h3>
<p>Last year, the Ningbo liners of the four companies, Swire, China Merchants, Ning Shao, and Sanbei, had a much better business in the second half of the year than in the first half. From January to the end of June, the freight revenue of the four ships was 298,550 yuan. In the second half of the year, from July 1st to the end of December, it was 411,410 yuan. The total freight revenue of the four ships in the first and second halves of the year was 709,960 yuan. Compared to the previous year's business, the total income was still not as high. In the previous year, the four ships received a total of 795,089 yuan and four dimes, which was more than one-tenth less than the previous year, showing the depression of the shipping industry last year.</p>
<h3>Continued Cooperation This Year</h3>
<p>The total freight accounts of the Ningbo ships of the four companies have already been revealed by each company. Those who should allocate funds have allocated the funds to those who have received them. This year, the four Shanghai-Ningbo shipping companies will continue to operate according to the original cooperation method. Whether the original contract needs to be modified will be decided at the four companies' representatives meeting.</p>
<h3>Salty Tide Enters Twice</h3>
<p>Drinking Causes Illness in Weak People</p>
<p>Spring has come and winter has gone, the Yangtze River is shallow, and salty tides often enter. Since the 28th of last month, the salty tide has rushed into Wusong, and it did not completely recede until the 3rd of this month. The residents suffered greatly from drinking water during this week. Not only was the water salty and astringent, but the water color was red and turbid like mud, making it difficult to swallow. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, the second salty tide rushed in again on the eve of the abolished lunar New Year, and it has not receded as of yesterday. During this period of salty water, in addition to laborers who are strong and healthy and not greatly affected, some of those who are weak are affected by the salty water and develop illnesses, or feel unwell after drinking the salty water, and their spirits are weak and depressed, which is common.</p>
<h3>Gambler Loses Money, Bodyguard Angrily Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>No One Knows in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>Discovered in the Morning, Unable to Save</p>
<p>A certain Mr. Huang, residing at number 51 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, is a comprador in a foreign company. He employs several bodyguards from China and Russia. Zhou Si, also known as Yusheng, from Dongtai, 29 years old, works as a bodyguard in the Huang family and is also responsible for opening the door. Every week, he alternates shifts with his colleague Wang Zhensan. When it is his shift, he sleeps alone in the gatehouse next to the main gate of the Huang residence. Zhou has worked in the Huang family for a long time and is still loyal, and is deeply valued by his employer. This week, it was Zhou's shift to open the door. The night before, he went out and gambled at a friend's house, losing over 30 silver dollars. He returned to his employer's residence late at night and went to his bedroom. Because of his gambling losses, he was overwhelmed with emotion and had a sudden impulse. He took the Browning pistol issued to him by his employer for protection and shot himself in the right corner of his head. The bullet penetrated deep into his brain, without exiting, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. Because it was late at night, and he was alone in the gatehouse, no one heard the gunshot. It was not until around 9:00 AM yesterday morning that his Russian bodyguard colleague, Vasilyev (35 years old), saw that Zhou was still asleep and had not gotten up. He went to knock on the door, calling for him for a long time but receiving no response. Knowing that something was wrong, he informed the employer, who then went to pry open the door and saw Zhou lying in a pool of blood on the ground, with fresh blood still flowing. The pistol was lying beside him. Knowing that he had committed suicide, and that his breathing was very weak, they immediately sent him to Guangci Hospital by car. It was too late to save him, and he soon died. The hospital and the employer reported to the French Police Department, who sent detectives to investigate the scene. The pistol was taken to the police station. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall autopsy center. At 10:30 AM, the Second Special District Court was notified and requested that the chief prosecutor come to the site to examine the body. First, Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the results of the investigation after the incident, and stated that the deceased had a mistress, Zhou Liu, but her address was unknown, making it impossible to summon her to the case. The deceased's colleagues, the Russian bodyguard Vasilyev, the Chinese Wang Zhensan, and the tea boy Gao Yongqing, were summoned for questioning. According to the report, the official questioned each witness who arrived about the circumstances of discovering the deceased's suicide and his life before his death. It was ruled that Zhou Si, also known as Yusheng, had died from a gunshot wound sustained before death. Because no family members of the deceased had arrived, it was ordered that the body be photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall, awaiting identification.</p>
<h3>Record of the Investigation of the Fierce Robber Who Shot and Killed Chinese and Western Detectives</h3>
<p>The Fierce Robber's Injuries Have Healed</p>
<p>He Denies Everything During the Court Hearing</p>
<p>On October 15th of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team cracked a robbery case and arrested a gang member named Chen Bingsheng, who confessed that a pistol was hidden in the pavilion room at the back door of number 8, Alley 1, Hengqing Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle (number 12, Alley 2). Team leader Lu Ying, based on the confession, sent squad leader Liu Changrui, along with detectives Gong Lixiang, Chen Liangfu, Ni Ziyu, and others, and Chen, to report to the special agency of the French Police Department and request them to send detectives to go together to retrieve the pistol that evening at 10:30 PM. The Western detective chief, upon receiving the report, sent Western detective McStetkoff (Russian) and Chinese detective Lu Zhixiang, among others, to go to the address. They arrived at their destination at 10:50 PM and knocked on the door to enter. When they went upstairs, the robbers Zhang Xibiao and Wu Yaoting (cousins, both from Shaoxing) in the pavilion room had already heard the sound and knew that things were not good, and were prepared. When the detectives went upstairs, they saw that the door to the pavilion room was ajar. Led by the Western detective, they pushed open the door and entered first, and the detectives behind them followed in single file. Unexpectedly, Wu Yaoting held a Mauser pistol in his left hand and a Browning pistol in his right hand. Seeing the detectives entering the room, he used both hands to open fire and resist arrest, fatally wounding Western detective McStetkoff and Public Security Bureau detective Gong Lixiang, who fell to the ground and died. The other detectives, such as Liu Changrui, Chen Liangfu, and Lu Zhixiang, were wounded in the throat, abdomen, arm, etc., and fell to the ground. The captured robber Chen Bingsheng, frightened, jumped out of the window of the pavilion room, injuring his leg. Seeing that the detectives were either dead or injured, Wu and his cousin Zhang Xibiao immediately escaped from the roof. Upon hearing the news, the French Police Department sent detectives to the scene and sent the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the deceased were sent to the autopsy center. They searched for the escaped robbers in the nearby area. Wu escaped from the roof, still holding a gun in both hands, and hired a rickshaw to run north on Rue Amiral Bayle to the Rue du Père Robert intersection, where he encountered a team of French, Vietnamese, and Russian patrol officers sent out by the French Police Department. Seeing the rickshaw rushing and the passenger with a panic-stricken look, the officers ordered the rickshaw to stop for inspection. Wu, sitting in the rickshaw, opened fire again to resist arrest and jumped down, fleeing west from Rue du Père Robert into Wufeng Lane, jumping onto the roof of a low flat house to hide. The officers followed and entered, seeing a dark shadow on the roof, and opened fire to return fire. The detectives who were searching for the robbers in the Hengqing Lane area, hearing the sound of gunfire, rushed to help and surround them. Wu, on the roof, was wounded in eight places on his body and fell, and was finally captured. The Mauser pistol was seized, but he could no longer move and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The robber Zhang Xibiao and his wife had already escaped without a trace. That night, the detective found a set of short pants and a jacket made of white cloth, fully stained with blood, that the robber had taken off in Hengqing Lane. The next morning, the police department sent Wu to the case and sent it to the Second Special District Court, asking for a postponement until Wu's injuries healed before questioning. The prosecutor was also reported to examine the bodies of the Chinese and Russian detectives. Wu has been diligently treated by doctors at Guangci Hospital, and his injuries have healed. The injured detectives have also recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The French Police Department had completed the investigation and sent Wu, the robber (whose injuries on various parts of his body had healed, except for a bullet in his right arm that had not yet been removed, but he was able to move normally), back to the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu and Secretary Ren Qiweng, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, specially opened the Second Criminal Court to try the case. The police department summoned the Public Security Bureau detectives and French Police Department detectives who were injured at the scene, as well as Chinese police numbers 415 and 658, four Russian police, and two French police to appear in court as witnesses. The official ordered Wu to be brought to court, first questioning him about his age, origin, and address. According to Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer representing the police department, the circumstances of the case and the investigation were explained, and the weapons used to resist arrest, the Mauser pistol, the bullets, and the recovered bloody clothes were presented to the court. Wu was prosecuted for murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wu claimed that he was not in the pavilion room when the incident happened and did not know about the shooting. The official questioned him that since he was not in the room and did not know about the shooting, how was the Mauser pistol seized from him? Wu, at a loss for words, claimed to be deaf and did not hear the question. The official further questioned him that since he had already admitted it in the police department, why did he completely deny it when asked in court? Wu replied that he had no choice. Although he was repeatedly questioned strictly in court, Wu claimed ignorance and repeatedly protested his innocence. The official then summoned the witnesses in the case, such as the Public Security Bureau and French Police Department detectives, and the Chinese, French, and Russian police, as well as women Du Tang, Wang Duan, Zhao Aqing, Cao Wenrong, Zheng Yao, and others (landlords, street sweepers, rickshaw pullers, etc. from Hengqing Lane), to the court for questioning one by one, ordering them to provide a written statement and attach it to the record. Because it was late, it was ruled that the hearing would be postponed. The defendant was returned to custody, and the others left to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>The Heartless Zhu Rongshen Has Almost Killed Yan Xiu'e</h3>
<p>New Bride Not a Virgin</p>
<p>Last Words Reveal the Truth</p>
<p>Yan Xiu'e, a woman from Ningbo, was in her early twenties, possessed of beautiful features, and a graduate of a girls' school, well-versed in literature and reasoning. Her father, Yan Lanyou, was in the fruit business. Her mother, Wang, aged forty-two, divorced in 1929 due to irreconcilable differences. Wang remarried a fellow townsman, Li Meian, aged forty, who worked as a senior clerk at the Siming Bank in the city, earning enough for a comfortable living. Xiu'e lived with her mother. By 1930, Wang and others considered Xiu'e an adult and arranged her marriage to Wang Chengyao, a native of Ningbo, aged twenty-seven, who worked as a clerk on a ship. Not long after the marriage, they divorced due to incompatibility. After the divorce, she returned to her mother's home. In March of last year, Xiu'e was introduced by a neighbor, Mrs. Hong, to Zhu Yunshen, aged twenty-six, who worked as mailman number 705 at the North Sichuan Road Post Office. Zhu lived at number 15 Huotui Alley, Dadongmen, Nanshi. After meeting her, he was captivated by her talent and beauty and proposed marriage. Through Mrs. Hong, he discussed the matter with Xiu'e's mother, and they became engaged. Following modern customs, the engaged couple frequently went out and traveled together. Their love grew daily, and they engaged in sexual relations. Unexpectedly, after achieving his sexual desires, Zhu discovered that Xiu'e was not a virgin, and his affection waned. Recently, he discarded her like worn-out shoes, treating her like a stranger, and planned to annul the engagement, demanding the return of the 120 yuan given as betrothal gifts. Xiu'e realized she had met the wrong person, and her heart shattered. The thought of suicide arose. The night before last, around 7 pm, Xiu'e bought four jiao of raw opium and, finding the taste too bitter, bought four oranges, extracted the juice, and swallowed the opium with it. She also drafted a suicide note, hid it on her person, and went to Zhu's house to confront him and accuse him of infidelity. Zhu was not home. Zhu's parents, not recognizing her as their son's fiancée, dismissed her despite her explanation. Leaving Zhu's house, Xiu'e felt even more miserable. Shortly after, passing the Jiangxia Lane entrance at Dadongmen, the opium took effect. In extreme pain, she collapsed, unconscious. Gao Fushan, a patrolman from the 37th post, found her pale and foaming at the mouth. He rushed her to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. They found the suicide note on her person. It read: "I am an unfortunate woman, with nowhere to belong. My suicide is my own fault, for recognizing a heartless and unrighteous man as my fiancé. He violated my body, and now he has abandoned me. Initially, my mother did not approve, but he insisted. Now, regret is futile. This man's name is Zhu Rongshen, and he lives at number 15 Huotui Alley, Dadongmen, Nanshi. I beg the gentlemen to notify him to collect my body. I will be forever grateful in the afterlife." It was signed "Yan Xiu'e, a woman of misfortune." The police realized she had attempted suicide. Seeing that she still remembered her unfaithful fiancé and asked him to collect her body, they imagined her infatuation. The doctors said the poisoning was not deep and she would likely survive. Gao reported to the section chief, Liu Yunfang, who sent patrol leader Zhang Panchi and officer Li Fuyi to investigate. They went to Zhu's house but heard that he had fled in fear. They reported back and were ordered to send Yan Xiu'e to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposition today.</p>
<h3>A Founder of the Bodhisattva Hotel Regrets Involvement in a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Fan Fayuan Pleads with People, Speaking Too Freely with Casual Acquaintances</p>
<p>Gao Shuo and Qian Chengxu Incur Trouble by Lending Their Names</p>
<p>Fan Fayuan, who trades in silver ear mushrooms, is a sociable person, with many connections in political circles. Last year, Fan wanted to establish a new-style hotel, named the Bodhisattva Hotel, and sought partners to subscribe to shares. His solicitation letter was a blank piece of red paper. Meeting people, regardless of their relationship, he pulled out the paper and described his plan, asking them to sign as founders of the Bodhisattva Hotel. Gao Shuo, a former councilor of the Control Yuan (courtesy name Yangzhi), and Qian Chengxu, a lawyer, were among those who signed the red paper. Fan sought to realize his plan and contracted with China Continental Commercial Building and Xinlinji Construction Factory to build the hotel. However, the plan failed. The construction factory, citing losses, sued Fan Fayuan and the other founders of the Bodhisattva Hotel in the First Special District Court, seeking compensation for breach of contract. The defendants lost. Gao and Qian, having been listed by Fan as founders, were jointly liable with the other founders, according to the court. Deeply regretting their entanglement, they resented Fan's deceit. They only casually wrote their names, with no clear indication that they were founders, and did not know how Fan had used the paper afterward. They refused to be responsible and jointly hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Fan in the First Special Court, accusing him of forgery. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan summoned Fan Fayuan, but he did not appear. His wife, Fan Chen, appeared and said that Fan had gone to Tianjin and had not been in touch for months, so she did not know his whereabouts. Gao Shuo requested an arrest warrant. Judge Wu said that since his whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to arrest him, and suspended the trial.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Strictly Forbids Gambling During the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>Posters and Announcements Offer Sincere Warnings</p>
<p>Those Who Violate Will Be Strictly Arrested</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that unemployed vagrants would use the Lunar New Year celebrations as an excuse to gather and gamble, affecting social customs and the livelihoods of ordinary people, ordered the Inspection Department and district offices to ban gambling. Notices were posted in teahouses and key street intersections. The text reads: "Gambling not only harms social customs but also affects the livelihoods of ordinary people. It has been strictly prohibited many times. However, as time passes, people become complacent and repeat their mistakes. Ignorant people exhaust the year's hard-earned money in a single gamble, even pawning possessions and borrowing to bet everything. Winning leads to indulgence and excess; losing leads to despair and poverty. Light cases lead to lost time and unemployment; serious cases lead to ruin and broken families, causing harm to the family and society. The Lunar New Year is approaching, and gambling may resurge. Given the economic downturn, we should not waste any resources. The Public Security Bureau has a duty to ban gambling. This notice reiterates the prohibition. Teahouses and all citizens must comply and refrain from gambling. Those who violate this will be strictly arrested. Teahouses that host gambling will be ordered to close. This is final." (Rest of the notice omitted)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Training Fleet Headquarters Requesting Compensation for the Sinking of a Cargo Ship by the Yongji</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Naval Training Fleet Headquarters: "We are writing regarding the case of the sinking of Xu Laofu's cargo ship, belonging to the Shanghai Iron and Steel Machinery Industry Association, which was struck by the Dongji warship. We requested an investigation and compensation on January 31st. On February 6th, we received a reply stating that the commanding officer of the Yongji frigate reported that the fault did not lie with the warship. We forwarded this to the industry association, which replied stating that the Yongji captain's report did not match Xu Laofu's report. According to Xu Laofu, when turning into the Suzhou Creek, the Yongji warship was traveling at high speed. As they were about to pass, with a distance of seven or eight zhang between them, the Yongji suddenly turned, heading towards the Bund Park, causing the barge's stern to be smashed and sinking it into the creek. Sixteen tons of pig iron sank with the ship. Fortunately, the Hua Du medical ship rescued the entire crew. This is the description of the incident. The Yongji captain's report stated that the waterway was blocked and dangerous, so he turned left to pass the barge's stern. The barge, loaded with iron, was slow to maneuver, causing its stern right side to lightly brush against the warship's bow, and then drift away. Only one crossbeam was broken, and the rope was still dragging alongside the ship. He did not see it sink. The reports differ. It is difficult to determine who is right. However, the sinking of the ship is obvious to all, and the Hua Du medical ship rescued the crew. The captain's statement that he did not see it sink is a fabrication, or he did not pay attention to the barge after the collision and continued on, unaware of its sinking and the crew's plight. The shipowner is destitute. The association's sixteen tons of pig iron also sank. Efforts to salvage two tons have been made, and compensation should be paid for the loss. The Naval Headquarters did not witness the incident and only relied on the captain's report. A further investigation is necessary. We urge you to forward this to the Naval Training Fleet Headquarters and request a thorough investigation and fair compensation. We request that you consider the hardship of the merchant.</p>

<h3>Modern Cold Leg Disease · Qu · Shao · Heng</h3>
<p>(Welcome to Reprint)</p>
<p>The name "cold leg" is a northern colloquialism. Because the climate in the north is cold, more people suffer from this problem, so it can attract everyone's attention. I have lived in the north for many years and have also experienced this disease, and I have also studied it to some extent. At first, I thought it was due to the climate in the north, but I didn't expect that after moving back to my hometown of Shanghai last year, there are still many patients with the same symptoms, especially young women. When I asked the older generation, they all said that they had never heard of this disease in their youth. Therefore, I dare to boldly say that Shanghai should not have this disease. The reason why it is happening now is that the modern attire is indeed a major cause. Therefore, I gave it a name called "Modern Cold Leg Disease." I think if we continue to be so modern, this disease will definitely spread to an uncontrollable extent, which will have a significant impact on the health of the nation and the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, I wrote this article to raise everyone's awareness.</p>
<p>The cause of cold legs is the cold air received from the legs. Originally, the air in the universe, whether indoors or outdoors, is always thinner in the upper layer and thicker in the lower layer. And hot air, because of its expansion, rises. Then, the air that has not expanded comes to replenish its position. As a result of this rising and falling, wind is generated (commonly known as ground wind). I have a very obvious proof, although it is an old trick, please try it. That is to take two candles and light them both. Place one on the upper frame of the door and one on the lower frame of the door. Please look at the direction of the flames. The upper one must be outward, and the lower one must be inward. This is ironclad proof of the invisible flow of air. There is also one thing that everyone has experienced, that is, when playing cards indoors on a cold day, if someone opens the door and doesn't close it, the card players will definitely be engrossed in the middle, feeling a cold air on their feet, and they will shout the slogan of closing the door in unison. From this point of view, although the human body is exposed to the same cold air, because of the position of the body, the lower body is particularly susceptible to the invasion of cold air. In warm climates, of course, it doesn't matter. However, in cold climates, we must pay attention. You see the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai are all barefoot. The rickshaw pullers in the north wear long gowns, shoes, and socks, just like gentlemen. At first, I thought it was the rules of the rickshaw pullers in the north. Later, I learned that it was because the climate in the north was too cold. Therefore, when Bai Chongxi's barefoot soldiers arrived in Beiping in 1920, there was no problem in the summer and autumn. Later, when the ruthless north wind blew, these barefoot soldiers couldn't stand it anymore. You see how clumsy the woolen nests worn by northerners are, and how thick the cotton pants are. Is it that northerners don't like to be beautiful? It's really because it's too cold, so they have to. Even with such attention, there are still many cases of cold legs. However, in recent years, the introduction of European fashion has been as rapid as lightning. It is especially evident in young women. In winter, they also wear straw-shoe-style leather shoes, fleshy silk stockings, bull-headed single pants, and open-neck dancing clothes. Their noses run with clear water non-stop, and they still endure to be fashionable. Even if they have frostbite all over their bodies, they still refuse to change. The older generation feels sorry for them. No matter how hard you try to persuade them, they won't listen. I have a few sentences to describe the attire of modern women. Please give me your advice. (Recently called modern thin clothes and single pants, walking on snow and ice, still exposing the knees, silk stockings and cool shoes, strolling on the streets, cold air invades, the lower body is particularly susceptible, back pain and leg pain, countless frostbite, severe cases lead to infertility, mild cases lead to menstrual disorders.) This is not because my words are too extreme. It is really not in line with the hygiene of the Chinese people. Therefore, I have to speak until my tongue is exhausted. Some people say that Europeans adopted this kind of dress first, and we are just imitating it. If it is harmful, they would not prohibit it. This is not a matter of Chinese and non-Chinese people, but a matter of whether the climate, habits, housing, and constitution of the Chinese people are suitable. Because Europe has the climate of Europe, and China has the climate of China. Europe has the constitution of Europeans, and China has the constitution of Chinese people. With different climates and different constitutions, how can we blindly imitate? Moreover, Europeans have worn thin clothes since they were young. Even the addition and subtraction of clothes is entirely based on the room temperature and climate. They don't take the seasons of winter and summer as the standard. The habits of Chinese people are completely different from theirs. Therefore, in the summer, even when it is windy and cold, they only wear a summer cloth gown. In the winter, they wear several sets of fur clothes to other people's houses and sit next to the stove and are unwilling to take them off. There are also the so-called modern young ladies who wear a lot at home, but when they go out, they wear less. This reason is really Ningbo people speaking brokenly. In the past, women valued a pretty head, but modern women value a pair of pretty feet. This love of beauty has simply become the biggest cause of cold legs.</p>
<p>The symptoms of cold legs. Looking at the meaning of the name of this disease, you know that the legs are cold. The reason why they are cold is because the nerves are stimulated by the cold air. Those blood vessels immediately contract. From one perspective, it is a good strategy to prevent the dissipation of body temperature. But the blood vessels contract, and the blood flowing to the legs is reduced. When the blood is reduced, the temperature is naturally reduced, and the nutrition is naturally not sufficient. The nerves on the legs, because of the direct stimulation of the cold, develop soreness and numbness. Because of the indirect relationship of nutritional disorders, the gait is not smooth, and even unable to walk. The cold stimulation received by the nerves is transmitted from the feet to the lower legs, from the lower legs to the upper legs, from the upper legs to the waist. As a result, the blood circulation of the reproductive organs (that is, the uterus, ovaries, etc.) within the scope of the waist nerve control is also obstructed. So, at first, it is only back pain and leg pain, and unsteady gait. Later, it will be difficult to sit and stand, unable to turn around, and even irregular menstruation, difficult to conceive, bladder pain, stomach pain, abdominal distension, and dripping urine. At this point, sleep cannot be peaceful, and diet cannot be strong. This disease does not distinguish between men and women, but because women wear less than men, especially the recent modern attire, which reveals their curves everywhere, even during menstruation and before and after childbirth, they do not care about the reduction of the body's resistance. Therefore, in reality, more women suffer from the disease than men.</p>
<p>The prognosis of cold legs. In mild cases, there is nothing serious. But if it accumulates over time, it will not only hinder health, but also reduce the degree of sexual desire. In women, menstruation and childbirth will naturally be affected. Recently, in the circle, I met Zhu Mogaokangsheng, who is very knowledgeable and experienced in raising chickens. At the same time, I went to visit his Shuyuan Chicken Farm. But when I walked into the gate and looked around, I didn't see a single chicken. I asked him, "Why don't you let the chickens out to roam around in such sunny weather?" Mr. Zhu said, "The ice on the ground hasn't melted yet. If the chickens step on the ice, their legs will be cold, and the number of eggs laid will decrease. I'm also afraid that they will pick up and eat cold things." I thought that if you want a chicken to lay more eggs, you still have to protect it like this. Do you think a woman who wants to have more children can be so exposed? The development of flowers, plants, fruits, and trees is also lush in places where the ground is warm, and it is not easy to grow in cold places. You see the flowers and trees in the flower baskets. In winter, some of them are wrapped in straw at the roots, and some of them are surrounded by mud at the roots. These are all proofs that defending against cold air is more important in the lower part than in the upper part. Now, modern attire is really against scientific principles. In the past three to five years, I have often heard young women of seventeen, eighteen, twenty-two, and twenty-three say that their backs ache and their legs hurt. It sounds worse than old women of seventy or eighty years old. If you imagine it like this, the evil result of this fashion will definitely lead to an epidemic of back pain and leg pain in five or ten years. This is what I call modern cold leg disease. This disease is really related to the strength and weakness of the nation. Those in power with a national concept should end this fashion that is not suitable for the place and not suitable for the constitution. I think the best way is to start with the uniform pants and shoes of schools. Some young women who are obsessed with fashion may say that I am an outdated antique. But the older generation and those who have already suffered from it will definitely nod in agreement. So, those who don't believe me now will definitely realize it in the near future. I have seen in Zhangjiakou and other border areas that the old farmers who cultivate the land, although their upper bodies are bare, they still wear a pair of cotton pants on their lower bodies. From this point of view, even uneducated old people know the fact that cold air comes from below. How can the young women of the educated class be so confused? When they reach the point where they cannot move or walk, it will be too late to regret it. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Now, I have joined the reading guidance, that is, your readers: can also be said to be your friends? Can also be said to be your students, you need to understand my level, interests, and everything... so that the guidance will not be estranged, wasteful, and actually achieve twice the result with half the effort,</p>
<p>I left school at the age of thirteen; being a small apprentice like a beast of burden to someone, naturally, writing was cut off from me.</p>
<p>Later, I opened a small grocery store of my own. This enclosed life; standing guard rigidly at the counter, one copper for paper, two copper for cigarettes, three copper for brown sugar, every day doing such tedious and fragmented work,</p>
<p>The year before last, I was introduced by a friend to work as an accountant in a small factory in Shanghai. This old-fashioned gown, I wore it for the first time, fortunately, I was good at abacus calculation, so I could cope with the work. What made me most embarrassed was that my writing was not good enough, especially a few words were really terrible, frightening, so reading gradually became a need for me,</p>
<p>But, what method to use to read? Read a book? Taking a book during work hours doesn't look right, and it hinders my duties, it's actually impossible, and buying books also costs money. Even if I buy them and read them, because I don't have the ability to choose, I can't get my interest, in the end, I still have to put in the effort in the newspapers. There are indeed confidants to be met in the tail of the newspaper, and even if colleagues see it, it doesn't matter. Sometimes, I would hide the sentences I liked,</p>
<p>In this way, for more than a year, many newspaper fragments accumulated, but it was very troublesome to look at, the ones that suited me, I couldn't find them for a while, so, I changed my approach again, I subscribed to a kraft paper notebook; as long as the writing that suits me, I cut it out and paste it on the notebook, how good this is! It's convenient to look at, and they are all good writings,</p>
<p>Our factory: originally subscribed to news newspapers, so I didn't know about the establishment of your library, accidentally, I looked up in the atrium of the Continental Shopping Mall, and saw a few golden characters on the glass window, which led me to walk into the library, I bought a catalog, and learned all of your procedures, therefore, I asked the newspaper deliverer to also deliver the Shen Bao, and joined your continuous reading guidance department,</p>
<p>I don't quite understand modern writing, some classical Chinese is added with (了), (的, (吗), etc.: and sometimes classical Chinese phrases are inserted in vernacular, some vernacular texts, every sentence seems to have a pause, even every word seems to be discordant: some vernacular texts can be read from beginning to end in one breath, which one is the standard, which one can be my model, (Letter from Xi Naizhen)</p>

<h3>Decision on the Preliminary Selection Method for Our Country's Soccer and Basketball Teams for This Year's Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Soccer...Selected from Guangdong Team and Shanghai's Three Teams</p>
<p>Basketball...Selected from North China and Shanghai Teams</p>
<p>The 11th Far Eastern Games will open in Manila, Philippines, on May 12th. Our country's authorities have decided to participate. As for the detailed methods for preparing and participating in the games, the Xie Jin Hui (Association for the Advancement) board of directors will decide and announce them at a meeting at the end of this month. However, the methods for soccer and basketball have reportedly been decided: (1) Soccer will be selected from the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai teams, and (2) basketball will be selected from the North China and Shanghai teams. Preliminary selections will be held in Shanghai in mid-April, and the core team members will be selected and determined from these basketball teams for training.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Social Education Expenses are the Highest in the Country</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that a list of social education expenses for each province and city in each fiscal year has been compiled, printed, and distributed. The budget figures for the 12th fiscal year reported by each province and city have also been compiled. Those whose percentages have reached the standards stipulated by the National Government's order include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Nanjing, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei. It is evident that the education departments and bureaus or management offices of these provinces and cities have made efforts to raise funds, which is commendable. The increase in social education expenses for the current year in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Nanjing, and Shanghai is all above 40,000 yuan, which is also considered conscientious. Guangdong Province's increase of over 300,000 yuan is particularly large, making it the highest in the country. Although Yunnan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other provinces have seen some increase in comparison, they still fall far short of the stipulated standards and should actively raise funds. In addition, the ratios in Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Gansu, Chahar, Shaanxi, and Shanxi are all below 5%, and some, such as Shaanxi and Shanxi, are only at or slightly above 1%, which is even more inadequate. The above eight provinces should urgently increase their fundraising efforts and submit a plan for increasing funds for approval within one month of receiving this document. This is of utmost importance. In addition to compiling the obtained data into a list and an order list, which will be issued separately, a list and an order list of social education expenses for each province and city in the 22nd fiscal year are enclosed for your reference. This order.</p>
<h3>Continuous Instruction in Military Training Skills for Schools Above the High School Level</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that the General Directorate of Training reported that military education in schools above the high school level is extremely important and difficult. However, the plan stipulates only three hours of implementation per week. It is difficult to achieve effective training in such a short weekly period for the most important and difficult subject. However, considering the limitations of the regulations and the progress of other courses in the school, it does not seem appropriate to increase the hours. Efforts should be made to remedy the situation within the existing hours to improve efficiency. It has been found that some schools use insufficient class time as an excuse to schedule military training outside of class hours, such as before 7 or 8 AM in winter or after 5 PM. This treats military training superficially and is difficult to implement. The Ministry previously requested that you issue an order to improve this situation. Now, it has been found that even when scheduled during class hours, spaced-out scheduling is also inappropriate. If the schedule is spaced out, each week must be divided into three sessions, each lasting only one hour. After preparation and roll call, there is very little time for actual instruction. Not only is it impossible to hold field exercises, but also classroom and gymnasium lessons are inevitably delayed. Training progress is difficult to achieve effectively. To remedy this, it is proposed that from the next semester, each school's military training time, which is three hours per week, should be scheduled continuously in one block of time within class hours so that practical exercises can be carried out immediately after classroom instruction, and the actual instruction time can be increased by reducing preparation time. This will not only allow for ample time for regular training but also enable timely field exercises without causing difficulties or delaying other courses. In addition, if there are multiple schools in the same location, the scheduling dates for military training should first be agreed upon by the military instructors of each school to facilitate the implementation of the General Directorate's regulations for mutual cooperation among military instructors in each school. The above measures will not hinder other school courses and will greatly enhance the effectiveness of military training. A formal request should be submitted for your examination and issuance of an order for all schools to comply with.</p>
<p>Based on this, the Ministry has agreed with the General Directorate of Training, stating that "In order to reduce preparation time, the two hours of practical training will be changed to continuous instruction, while the one hour of academic training will still be scheduled separately from the practical training. During the two hours of continuous practical training, rest time should still be allocated appropriately to comply with learning principles." In addition to issuing separate orders, you are hereby urgently ordered to instruct all public and private high schools and above under your jurisdiction to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Education Departments and Bureaus Should Immediately Submit Implementation Methods for Educational and Vocational Guidance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that the outline of methods for implementing educational and vocational guidance in educational administrative organs and primary and secondary schools in each province, city, and county was previously issued by the Ministry under Order No. 6617, and detailed implementation methods were ordered to be formulated. It has been over half a year, and they have not been submitted to the Ministry, which is inappropriate. You are hereby ordered to comply and submit them to the Ministry within ten days of receiving this telegram for verification. No further delays will be permitted.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Reporting of the Number of Teachers in Vocational Schools in Each Subject</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating that, according to reports from inspectors of the Ministry, each province and city has already planned and implemented the expansion of vocational schools on a yearly basis. However, there is a significant shortage of vocational teachers, and many have not formulated plans to cultivate qualified teachers in accordance with the previously issued regulations for the registration and training of vocational teachers in each province and city. To coordinate remedial measures, the Ministry urgently needs to understand the actual needs of each province and city. You are hereby ordered to promptly carry out the registration and verification of vocational teachers, and with reference to the plan for expanding vocational education in the previously submitted standard methods for the establishment and financial allocation of secondary schools, accurately estimate the number of high- and low-level vocational teachers needed in each subject in the next five years. Submit this information to the Ministry within ten days of receiving this order. No delays will be permitted.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Chinese Art Exhibition in Berlin</h3>
<p>The biggest event in German academic circles in three years.</p>
<p>Berlin Correspondence: The Chinese Art Exhibition in Berlin, which has caused a sensation in Germany, has been in preparation for a long time. Since the arrival of the Chinese representative Liu Haisu in Germany, newspapers in various German provinces have been publishing Liu's speeches and news of the exhibition's preparation every day. All sectors of German society have paid close attention to this matter. On January 20, 1914, the opening ceremony of the exhibition was officially held at the National Art Academy on Pariser Platz in Berlin. The number of attendees was unprecedented for art exhibitions from various countries, making it the grandest spectacle in the European art scene. The prominent figures who participated that day included German government representatives such as Education Minister Rust, Foreign Minister Leratte, Foreign Ministry Far East Director Major, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces Seeckt, Prince Lippe, Count Striben, Art Academy Director Gallass, Oriental Art Association President Sasha Wu, Far Eastern Society Secretary-General Linke, the French Ambassador, the Italian Ambassador, the Belgian Ambassador, the Spanish Ambassador, the Dutch Ambassador, the Czech Ambassador, the Swedish Ambassador, the British Ambassador, as well as Professor Brache, Professor Gomis, the president of the Berlin Art Association, the famous Oriental scholar Dr. Rexin, Professor Fofengke, and the former Chinese Minister to Germany Paulxi. The president of the Chinese Academy in Florence, Luyawen, also made a special trip from Florence to Berlin to participate. On the Chinese side, in addition to Ambassador Liu Chongjie and Representative Liu Haisu, embassy secretary Tan Boyu, Tan Baoduan, and Liang Long, the acting representative in Czechoslovakia, also made a special trip to attend. Over three thousand other prominent figures and reporters attended, making it a rare grand event in Berlin. On the day before the opening, the Oriental Art Association and the National Art Academy hosted a preview for reporters from various countries, so on the opening day, Berlin newspapers had already published detailed reports and critiques of the exhibition's content, as well as photos of Liu Haisu and his wife. The grand opening ceremony is described below.</p>
<p>Grand Opening</p>
<p>The National Art Academy is located on Pariser Platz.</p>
<p>This is the most luxurious and bustling area of Berlin. At 11:00 AM on January 20th, the Chinese national flag could be seen fluttering in the shining sunlight from afar, starting at the Brandenburg Gate. In an instant, carriages and horses had gathered in front of the Art Academy. Countless spectators stood on both sides outside the academy. When Chinese representative Liu Haisu and his wife, accompanied by Ambassador Liu Chongjie and his wife, arrived by car from the large square to the gate of the Art Academy, some spectators raised their hands in salute, while others cheered enthusiastically, expressing their warm admiration. Liu and others happily entered the Art Academy. They were led by receptionists to the reception room, where they shook hands and greeted German government representatives such as Education Minister Rust, Foreign Minister Leratte, Oriental Art Association President Shaerwu, Berlin Art Museum Director-General Guanmeilan, and ambassadors from various countries. In addition to the Chinese representatives and the ambassador and interpreters, only specially invited ambassadors and celebrities from various countries were allowed into the reception room. Mr. Liu's wife, Ms. Cheng, accepted the flowers presented to Mr. Liu and expressed her gratitude. Many German dignitaries and scholars warmly expressed their admiration for Chinese painting to the Lius. The famous Oriental scholar</p>
<p>Xing, the former Chinese Minister to Germany Paulxi, said, "All the works in this exhibition have the pure essence of Chinese painting and have absolutely no foreign influences. They truly satisfy us." The director of the National Library, Frank, said, "In the current transformation of Chinese politics, the progress and vitality of modern Chinese painting are very surprising." At that time, guests gathered in the auditorium for a meeting.</p>

Looking back at the children in this city, most of them go to bed and wake up late, and their sleep time is often insufficient. This semester, the class time of primary and secondary schools in this city should be advanced to 8 AM in the morning and dismissed at 4 PM in the afternoon to cultivate children's habit of getting up and going to bed early. Each school should pay attention to contacting families and engage in promotion to achieve significant results. This order is attached with the matters needing attention for arranging teaching schedules as follows: (1) The teaching schedule is simply called the schedule, and it is detailed as the weekly teaching time allocation table. It must not be mistakenly referred to as the curriculum or life table, etc. (2) The names of the subjects should strictly comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Education's curriculum standards. (3) The time for each subject should be calculated in hours for middle schools and in minutes for primary schools. Middle schools should arrange according to the fixed number of hours, and primary schools should arrange according to the scores of each grade stipulated by the Bureau. (4) The arrangement of the teaching schedule should pay attention to the following points: (1) Each class in senior high school should not exceed 50 minutes, and each class in junior high school should be 45 minutes in principle. (2) Each class in the lower grades of primary school should be 30 minutes in principle, and each class in the middle and high grades should not exceed 60 minutes. (3) The first and last classes of primary school every day should be arranged with subjects that are more interesting or that control the muscles, such as morning assembly, work, and physical education. (4) The first and second classes in the morning in middle school and the second class in the morning in primary school should be arranged with subjects that are more difficult to learn, such as Chinese and arithmetic. (5) For primary school assignments that are fine or monotonous, the number of classes should be more, and the time for each item should be shorter, such as writing small characters, writing articles, and calculating arithmetic application problems, etc. (6) Subjects that do not require concentration, such as music and games, can be arranged in the first or last class in the afternoon. (7) Subjects that take more time to clean up, such as work, should be arranged in the last class. Primary schools can also combine two classes to reduce the number of times the subject is held each week and increase the time. (8) After using large muscles, such as physical education, work, and practice, do not continue to teach lessons that use fine muscles, such as calligraphy and painting. (9) Subjects that require physical and mental labor should be allocated alternately, such as arranging music after practicing arithmetic and arranging physical education after writing, etc. (10) Physical education should not be arranged in the class before lunch or the class after lunch. (11) Attention should be paid to students' interest in each subject within each class. For example, if primary school stipulates 30 minutes of arithmetic, and children's interest is only about 11 minutes, then after practicing, arithmetic games should be continued for more than 10 minutes, etc.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Follow Regulations When Enrolling Students</h3>
<p>Such as indiscriminately accepting students and skipping grades, etc.</p>
<p>If the facts are verified, the principal will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to private middle schools that have been registered, stating that it is true that most private middle schools in this city are able to abide by the regulations and seriously assess students when enrolling new students and transfer students at the beginning of each semester. However, some schools seek to attract students without examining their academic qualifications and indiscriminately accept them. This only encourages students'侥倖之心 (jiaoxing zhi xin, a mind set of gaining by fluke) and defeats the purpose of setting up schools for further study. The Bureau has previously stipulated regulations to strictly prevent this. According to investigation reports, at the beginning of this semester, many private middle schools in this city again indiscriminately enrolled new students, and some even induced students from other schools to skip grades. This violates the regulations and is inappropriate. In addition to strictly supervising and reviewing the enrollment of students and the reporting of student records in each school to prevent long-standing abuses, this Bureau hereby orders the school to earnestly follow the regulations when enrolling students. If the above-mentioned situation is discovered and verified, all enrollment qualifications should be immediately revoked, and the principal will be given a sanction. This order must be complied with.</p>

(8) Chen Lifu and Guo Youshou introduced Luo Tianfang and Qing Jun as members: It was resolved to approve.</p>
<h3>Parents of Students Beware: Bandits Deceive Children to Obtain Clothing</h3>
<p>City Education Bureau Requests Public Security Bureau, etc. to Investigate</p>
<p>Recently, in this city, there have been criminals who specifically deceive elementary school students to obtain items such as scarves, robes, woolen sweaters, and hand-held book bags. During afternoon school teaching hours, these criminals wait on the way, pretending to be friendly with the children, and falsely claim to have large reels of film to give away secretly at a certain location. However, they say they need to borrow the scarf, robe, woolen sweater, etc., from the child to wrap the film, so as to prevent the film from being damaged by the wind. As a result, the clothing is deceived away. Most of the victims are children around ten years old, and the incidents occur in remote and desolate places. The City Education Bureau has learned that several cases have already been discovered in municipal elementary schools and has immediately sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and the Concession Police to conduct strict investigations. At the same time, they hope that parents of students will cooperate and pay attention, it is said.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts Holds Spring Semester Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is the highest art institution in our country. For over twenty years, it has continuously promoted the development of art in our country. Last year, Principal Liu Haisu went to Germany and held a Chinese modern painting exhibition. Since then, the Board of Directors appointed Vice Principal Wang Jiyuan as acting principal, who has been determined to revitalize the academy. This semester, based on the actual situation, practical improvements have been made. A counseling committee and a teaching affairs committee have been established, and Tang Jun, Wang Jiqian, and others have been newly hired as professors. The spring semester opening ceremony was held at the school's Yihai Hall at 10:00 AM on the 15th, where scholarships and certificates were awarded. In addition, the first school affairs meeting decided to approve the number of free tuition quotas for needy students as follows: (1) Issuing scholarships and certificates: In order to encourage students' character and academic performance, the school has established scholarships. The directors Cai Yuanpei, Qian Xinzhi, Ye Yufo, Yuan Ludeng, Gu Shusen, President Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, and Director Wu Mengfei have determined that 170 yuan in scholarships will be awarded each semester. In addition to the 40 yuan in landscape painting scholarships awarded last semester, the remaining 130 yuan has been allocated according to the scholarship committee's decision on scholarship distribution and award standards.

<h3>Vacuum Tube for Detection</h3>
<p>— Gao Chongling</p>
<p>Continued from previous</p>
<p>The reason vacuum tube detection is superior to crystal detection is because (1) vacuum tubes are more sensitive than crystals. The sensitivity of an ordinary vacuum tube is about five times that of a crystal. (2) The selectivity of vacuum tubes is better than that of crystals. (3) Detecting vacuum tubes not only detect, but also amplify the sound, which crystals cannot do. (4) Detecting vacuum tubes can not only convert high-frequency amplitude-modulated waves into audio-frequency waves (wireless telephone), but also be used to receive high-frequency continuous waves (C.W.) radiotelegraphs. When receiving continuous waves, the detector tube must also serve as an oscillator (such as in the heterodyne method), or the detector tube must be used in conjunction with another oscillator tube (such as in the superheterodyne method). Crystal radios, however, cannot receive continuous waves.</p>
<p>Both diodes and triodes can be used for detection, but diodes are far less sensitive than triodes, so diodes used for detection have almost been completely eliminated. The detector tubes currently in use, in addition to triodes, also include tetrodes. The commonly used triodes are 201A, 27, 30, 37, 56, and 119. The tetrodes are 22, 24A, 3232, 35, 3939, 57, and 8.</p>
<p>[Diagram:] Figure 1: Plate Detection</p>
<p>Time Plate Current Average Increase in Plate Current Grid Voltage</p>
<p>[Diagram:] Figure 2: Grid Detection</p>
<p>Plate Current Time Average Decrease in Plate Current Grid Voltage</p>
<p>There are two types of vacuum tube detection: one is plate detection, and the other is grid detection (for plate-grid detection, please refer to Mr. Huang Jiancun's Radio Knowledge in the 46th issue of this publication). Plate detection requires a negative grid bias voltage (i.e., a C battery) to make the detection operating point P suitable at the lower curved section of the vacuum tube's static characteristic curve, as shown in Figure 1. When an external positive voltage is applied to the grid, the increase in plate current is greater than the decrease in plate current when an external negative voltage is applied to the grid, so the average plate current after rectification increases. This current flows into the earphones, causing the diaphragm to vibrate and produce sound. Grid detection does not use a grid bias voltage, but uses a grid capacitor and a grid leak connected in parallel to the grid, so its detection operating point P is at the upper curved section of the static characteristic curve, as shown in Figure 2, so the average plate current after rectification decreases. Grid detector tubes are more sensitive than plate detector tubes when receiving weak signals, so grid detector tubes are commonly used.</p>
<p>In what stage a detector tube should be placed in a multi-tube radio is also a very important issue. In modern radios, the detector tube is often placed before the power tube (i.e., the final audio-frequency amplification tube), in other words, in the second-to-last stage, called a power detector. There are four benefits to this: (1) reducing distortion caused by detection, (2) reducing the number of audio-frequency amplification tubes, thereby reducing distortion produced by audio-frequency amplification tubes, (3) reducing AC hum and noise produced by audio-frequency amplification tubes, (4) alleviating the problem of filtering hum and reducing the cost of audio-frequency amplification, thereby reducing costs.</p>
<h3>Vacuum Tube for Amplification</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Amplification is one of the main tasks of a vacuum tube. There is radio-frequency amplification before detection, and audio-frequency amplification or intermediate-frequency amplification after detection. Because the required positions are different and the strengths are different, even though they are both vacuum tubes for amplification, their structures and styles are also diverse. Here, four of the most commonly used types are briefly described.</p>
<p>(1) Screen Grid Tube: When triode vacuum tubes are used for high-frequency amplification, interelectrode capacitance exists between the plate and grid inside the tube. The plate energy is often fed back to the grid through this capacitance, resulting in oscillation, which not only eliminates the amplification effect, but also interferes with radio wave reception. The main advantage of the screen grid tube is that it can eliminate this problem. Its structure adds a screen grid between the plate and grid of an ordinary triode to shield the plate and grid, reducing the capacitance between them to an extremely low level, so that it can no longer cause feedback. Because screen grid tubes have extremely high mutual conductance, their amplification capacity is also far superior to that of triodes. Examples include 222 and 224.</p>
<p>(2) Variable-Mu Screen Grid Tube: The term for the amplification factor of a vacuum tube is abbreviated as mu (µ). Variable-mu means that the amplification factor is variable. The grid structure of this type of vacuum tube is unique. The distance between the coils is unequal, being wide in the middle and dense at both ends. Its characteristic is that when the grid negative potential is weak, the amplification factor is extremely high, just like an ordinary screen grid tube. However, when the grid negative potential is extremely large, electrons can only pass through the small part of the grid that is wide and sparse in the middle and be emitted towards the plate, so the plate current changes extremely little and the amplification factor is also low. Using this type of vacuum tube can reduce the amplification factor when the incoming signal is too strong and increase it when it is weak. Therefore, this type of vacuum tube not only amplifies but also contains the function of volume control. Examples include 235 and 551.</p>
<p>(3) Screen Grid Radio Frequency Pentode: This type of vacuum tube adds a space charge grid between the cathode and the grid in addition to the four poles of an ordinary screen grid tube. Its function is to eliminate the space charge near the cathode, increase the mutual conductance of the vacuum tube, and increase the amplification factor. An example is 58.</p>
<p>(4) Power Pentode: To make the volume of a radio large, the final-stage audio-frequency amplification tube must have an extremely high amplification factor and be able to output strong, undistorted power. The power pentode was created for this purpose. Its structure is also different from the previous ones. The fifth electrode is called the cathode grid, or suppressor grid, and is connected to the cathode or filament inside the tube, so its potential is zero. Its position is between the plate and the screen grid. The electrons attracted by the plate travel at extremely high speeds. When they reach the plate, they often scatter the electrons of the plate. These scattered ionized electrons are strongly attracted by the nearby screen grid and travel rapidly backwards towards the screen grid, which is called secondary emission, causing the plate current to suddenly decrease. The vacuum tube cannot perform linear amplification and is prone to distortion. The function of the cathode is to repel these secondary emission electrons, so that they still return to the plate. Power pentodes are extremely sensitive. Even an extremely low input signal voltage can obtain a strong output. Therefore, using this tube, audio-frequency amplification only requires one stage, which is more than enough and very economical. Almost all output tubes in current radios use this type, and its effectiveness can be imagined. Examples include 247 and 238.</p>

<h3>Puppet Show</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>We are indignant with Puyi for acting as an emperor of a small puppet court, so we call him a puppet, and his actions are naturally a puppet show. Puppet shows are called "string puppet shows" in Shanghai, and "wooden head puppet shows" in Suzhou. In short, they are all directed by others and cannot be independent. The analogy is most accurate. In today's world where materialism prevails, these symbolic tricks are no longer in vogue, so puppet shows have become outdated. Only at the end of the year, those people from Jiangbei carry a small stage to the streets, beating gongs and drums and singing to solicit a few pennies to make a living, and they can still attract the appreciation of children.</p>
<p>Han Yan of the Song Dynasty liked to watch puppet shows and ordered Bao Daocheng to write a poem, which goes: "Another person sits upon a person's head, dancing in the empty air, stepping on spring. Don't let the strings break, children! Flesh and blood will all become strangers." This passage is found in Yu Wenbao's "Blowing Sword Record" of the Song Dynasty, where he adds a commentary: "This poem is like Han Gong's last words." The poem is naturally a doggerel, and doggerel always contains satirical advice. However, the puppet is an unaware creature, completely indifferent to the satire. Moreover, once you become a puppet and fall into someone's hands, will you be allowed to struggle or resist?</p>
<p>Humans are conscious and aware, so naturally they are unwilling to be puppets. However, it is often the case that people have a nominally lofty position but in reality have no power to exercise and are manipulated by others. Where can they express this suffering? In my opinion, there are many puppets in China. Just on the political stage, they are too numerous to count. The string-pullers are of all sorts, some are foreigners, some are Chinese, and among the Chinese, there are those from your own family and those from other families. The most skilled in the art of string-pulling are the "wives." In the past, there were three masters, advisors, second masters, and young masters in the yamen, and sometimes uncles were added. Now, the feminine side is flourishing, and all three masters are combined into one "wife." All wives are skilled at string-pulling. If there is more than one "wife," then the husband is even more pitiable as a puppet.</p>
<p>Even Puyi has been manipulated by various string-pullers, and it is possible that Bao Daocheng's prediction will come true. On March 1st, a new farce will be staged for audiences around the world. Manchuria has become a second Korea, destined to be tossed about like dust and confined like a turtle in a jar.</p>
<h3>Notes on Listening to Lectures at Huiqiao</h3>
<p>— Nanhai Shaou [Seagull of the South China Sea]</p>
<p>There are dozens of private middle schools in Shanghai. Among them, Huiqiao Nanyang Middle School is one that teaches conscientiously, charges low fees, and has the purpose of encouraging needy students.</p>
<p>Principal Wang Peisun has been managing the school single-handedly for more than thirty years, living a simple life, encouraging each other with perseverance, and managing school affairs from morning till night, while also teaching classes. As a reporter, I took the opportunity to visit Longhua, to visit the school, and to listen to the old man give a lecture.</p>
<p>That day was the day before the abolished lunar New Year's Eve. The subject taught was Chinese for the first year of middle school, and the text was Han Yu's "Farewell Preface to Li Yuan Returning to Gu." Peilao wore brown-rimmed glasses and an old black velvet skullcap, sitting at the lectern. When explaining, he used clear and simple analogies, mixing seriousness with humor. For example, he explained:</p>
<p>"A great man" means "a good son."</p>
<p>"Benefiting the people" is the starting point of "People's Livelihood."</p>
<p>The character "temple" in "sitting in the temple court, advancing and retreating officials" means that in ancient times, people believed in divine power, and all important national affairs had to be reported to the ancestors' temple, and divination was used to determine good fortune and advance or retreat; it is not the temple of monks and Taoists.</p>
<p>"Erecting banners and arranging bows and arrows" is like modern officials going out with a guard of "pistols and Mausers."</p>
<p>"Joy has rewards, anger has punishments" means that officials arbitrarily exercise their authority and blessings, and often use their own joy and anger as the measure of rewards and punishments, rather than the actual merit and crimes; this is the reason why the officialdom is flawed.</p>
<p>When he came to (curved eyebrows and full cheeks, clear voice and comfortable body, ... fluttering light skirts, covering long sleeves ...), he raised his hands and shook his body, simulating the voice and appearance of modern women, and their graceful dancing postures. Extremely beautiful, the students were all amazed.</p>
<p>The clear words were eloquent and tireless from beginning to end, giving a sense of spring breeze in the room.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Drinking and Dining, a Frenzied Farewell with Tears</p>
<p>Burning the Midnight Oil, Whispering Sweet Dreams Through the Long Night</p>
<p>Old Master Zhao sat above, thinking in his heart, no wonder this child is so happy, thinking that soon they will reunite in Qian'an. Speaking of it, it's really pitiful. Thinking this way in his heart, he looked down and saw that he was still smiling. Then he thought again, since he is so happy, let everyone eat and drink in a muddle, why should you worry about others? So he also coaxed Jiang Shi to eat and drink together. Zhao Ziqiang held a meat pie in his left hand and a wine glass in his right. In the fresh, crispy, and salty taste of the pie, wine was an indispensable thing. He drank it refreshingly, and kept drinking. When his stomach was full, he was also about 70% drunk. So he pressed his hand on the edge of the table, stood up, swayed twice, smiled and shook his head, saying: "Enough, don't really get drunk." As he spoke, he walked into the room and saw two plates on the table, one filled with apples and the other with bananas. Turning around, he saw Guizhi following in, and smiled: "You really know how to do things, anticipating that I would get drunk, and preparing these to sober me up. But I</p>
<p>want to eat two slices of pear, that would be refreshing." Guizhi smiled and said: "We're not leaving." Ziqiang held the table and smiled: "The wine is really enough, what time is it?" He looked up at the clock on the table, but it was gone. He asked: "Where is our clock?" Guizhi smiled and said: "Tonight, we don't need that thing, and we also hate that thing. I put it away." Hearing this, Ziqiang felt his heart flutter twice, and he didn't say anything. He took an apple in his hand, took out a small knife from his pocket, and slowly peeled it. Guizhi stood in front of him and raised her eyelids at him, saying: "That's right, eat an apple. After eating it, everything will be safe and sound." Ziqiang smiled and said: "You speak very well. Eating an apple means everything will be safe and sound. Then, what kind of omen does eating a banana bring?" (314)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wang Sheng-san</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Wang Sheng-san's brief biography has been detailed in various newspapers. I also recall one or two anecdotes, which are described below:</p>
<p>Sheng-san was first a tutor at the house of Tang Kunhua (named Guangzhao) in She County, Hu Prefecture. At that time, Tang was sent to Jiangning as a department head. Later, because of his upright nature, he was slandered by those who were jealous of him, so he resigned and returned home. He hired Wang as a tutor to teach his sons, Dezhao and De'ao, and his daughter, Jingfang. Before long, because the tutor's salary was very meager and he couldn't stand the boring life, he often went out at night to practice writing crab-like characters. After making some progress, he left without hesitation. Tang insisted on keeping him, but he didn't care. In the year of Yi Chou in the Qing Guangxu period, he traveled to Europe and the West. When he returned to China in the year of Yi Wei, he went to Fusang again in the year of Xin Chou. In the year of Ren Yin, he supplemented the special examinations of Geng Zi and Xin Chou and entered the court as a candidate by paying a fee. He was listed as a top scholar. His teachers were Dai Hongci, a Jinshi from Nanhai, Guangdong in the year of Bing Zi, and Wang Junlong from Xiangtan, Hunan. Those who passed the examination were all outstanding talents of the time, such as Zhu Shou-peng, Wang Xi-zeng, Huang Zhao-lan, Huang Yan-pei, and Xie Yong-xin from Shanghai. Those who were well-known also included Liu Shi-pei from Yizheng, Xu Qian from She County, and Jin Yong-liu from Biaopu. Only Wang Yunzhang from Wuxi (Western God) was listed as an alternate. Wang's work (Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty established three houses in the Imperial Academy. Later, Chen Dong led the students to petition at the palace gate to request Li Gang, which came from the Imperial Academy's theory) later said (Integrity stems from nature, not relying on learning). Therefore, even with the complexity of the Imperial Academy's three houses, this bright person could not be stained, and this upright person could not be bent. It can be said that in the 57 years, only cultivating this one scholar is enough. It can also be said that this one scholar is enough to cover all the students of the Imperial Academy.) The next (Tang Yang Wan memorialized to stop the Ming Jing Jinshi and requested that the states and counties recommend Ji Lian's theory), in which (Those who take scholars should seek practical actions and not adopt false reputations. The talents obtained will have a peaceful mind and correct scholarship, and they will be able to be used for the world and the country. ) Heng Jiantang commented as (Advocating Ye Shi's Shuixin theory, deeply and clearly, is closely related to the purpose of education. And supporting and correcting malpractices is especially important in schools, etc. At that time, the stereotyped essay was abolished, and the policy discussion was initially changed. The words and lines were carefully constructed, which is not comparable to ordinary copyists. His intention of promoting education has already been planted at this time, without waiting for the establishment of the Guanghua School on Daxi Road.</p>
<p>When he returned from his European tour, his home was in the city. His father was also poor. The place he lived was narrow and dark, and he didn't enter the city all year round, saying it was just a doghouse. Therefore, he often failed to greet his parents in the morning and evening. Later, he achieved remarkable political achievements in Zhejiang Water and in foreign affairs. After returning to Shanghai, he became wealthy again because of his real estate. However, in his later years, he was often troubled by his family. It is rare to hear that he suffered because of his wealth in his old age.</p>
<h3>End of the Year, Beginning of the Year</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>According to the Gregorian calendar, we have already passed the New Year. But according to the old habits that have been passed down, it is still the New Year!</p>
<p>The end of the year is certainly the most important period of the year, and it is also the time when people settle their debts. It is a large-scale event, so when the end of the lunar year arrives, everyone looks worried and is very embarrassed, that's right! Those who are used to being more comfortable on weekdays, whether it is for clothing, food, or other expenses, temporarily owe the shop. Because of their good credit, people are happy to oblige. But when the end of the year comes, when debts are piled high and there is nowhere to hide, they have to leave to get away with it, leaving a pile of debt and walking away, leaving people helpless.</p>
<p>Originally there is an idiom, which is (no debt, a light body.) Those who can eat some vegetable roots on weekdays may not have any problems when the end of the year comes. If one can adhere to the standard of measuring income to expenditure, one may not end up in a mess and at a loss. Therefore, the ancients said well: (It is better to prepare for rain before it comes than to dig a well when thirsty.) These two sentences can be a piece of advice to those who are full of debt at the end of the year, and it can also be said to be a warning!</p>
<p>But even though that is said, isn't everyone crying when they see the coffin? I once saw a playboy in my hometown who relied on the prestige of his ancestors on weekdays, owing east and owing west. When the end of the year came, people were anxious to death, but he was calm and leisurely, hiding at home alone, sitting around the stove, enjoying the snow and admiring the plum blossoms. How elegant and profound!</p>
<p>When the New Year comes, he appears again, still owing east and owing west, and no one dares to make things difficult for him. Isn't this a good thing to laugh at?</p>
<p>At the end of the year, are those who are leisurely waiting for the beginning of the year to pay off their debts?</p>
<h3>Random Remarks on Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Among the three friends of the cold season, only the plum blossom is the most charming. The plum is a deciduous tree. The early ones bloom before the winter solstice, and the late ones bloom at the time of the vernal equinox. If many plants are planted, they can prosper in order and continue without interruption. The color is either red or white. When the buds are just opening, the red ones are like dots of rouge, and the white ones are slightly tinted with tender green, hence the name "green calyx". The old trunk, which is a hundred years old, has twisted and coiled branches, and mossy scales. The flowers bloom all over the tree, and there are stamens hanging between the branches, about an inch long. When the wind blows, the green silk sways, and the shade can accommodate dozens of people. Those who love beauty carry wine to appreciate it, which is especially elegant.</p>
<p>My friend He Tianjian once commented on the places where plums are produced, saying that they are arranged like peas and gourds, the plums of Wuxi Meiyuan, withered and bald like old mulberries, the plums of Suzhou Dengwei, slender like peeled pine trees, the plums of Jiangning Longpan, clustered and crisscrossed like thorns, the plums of Hangzhou Gushan, unrestrained and soaring like hermits, the plums of Jiangxi Daging. He also said that plums should be viewed quietly, and even more so in deep mountains and dense forests. His words are extremely brilliant, and he is truly an eye for flowers.</p>
<p>Peng Xueqin vowed to paint 100,000 plum blossoms, which was passed down as an elegant event among scholars. After he passed away, Xiangqi Lao Ren wrote a eulogy in couplets: (He was famous for poetry and wine. Looking at his brilliant achievements, he greatly increased the color of plum blossoms in the painting academy. He wanted to cross the sea in a warship, but alas, the hero is old. It is unbearable to talk about the bloody battle in Jiangnan.) It was sad, heroic, and widely recited at the time.</p>
<p>The immortals of the Qing Dynasty offered: Wash the fallen plums clean, decoct them with snow water, and cook them with white porridge until they are cooked, named plum blossom porridge. The food is so elegant. How can those who drink lamb and fine wine know this taste?</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty, Heshen was in power. A certain Taishi wanted to please Heshen and catered to his entourage. Later, he relied on his talent and arrogance, and no longer cared about those who had helped him. The entourage were all unhappy with him. At that time, there was also someone who competed with him for favor. Seeing the plum blossom poem presented by the Taishi to Heshen, which had words such as "The Duke is charming," he said that this was satirizing the Chancellor, intending to mock the Chancellor for flattering and following orders. According to this poem, there was a plum tree in the Chancellor's mansion that bloomed in spring. He invited all the Hanlin scholars under his command to drink and write poems. The Taishi alone used the word "charming." Other Hanlin scholars, although they used Song Guangping's allusion to praise, avoided using the word "charming," which can be said to be clever. The Taishi was demoted as a result. Reading Song Liu Qianfu's sentence, (But being burdened by plum blossoms for ten years,) he laughed and said: "Duke Liu was suppressed by Shi Miyuan, which is no different from me."</p>
<p>Du Du Tang Yusheng of Wujin lived in Baimen and built the Qin Yin Garden at the foot of Jilong Mountain. His romantic talent and three unique names shone for a time. There was a Plum Blossom Painting Building where his wife, Shuanghu, painted plum blossoms. His wife once painted plum blossoms and sent them to Yusheng in Jiujiang, with a poem attached: (I broke off a plum blossom from Lingnan, thinking of the Jiangxue. You arrived in Jiangnan on a snowy day, not the plum blossom season. I painted a branch, but no one commented on it. It is worth sending it to you as a family letter, so thin it is like coral.) Yusheng's family was elegant, and his wife and daughters could all chant poems and were good at painting and playing the Qin. The sons were also elegant and romantic, without any vulgarity.</p>
<p>Yang Yunshi assisted Wu Fuwei in the military camp and was known as a talented scholar. He met Chen Meimei, a proofreader, on the Han River, and they were extremely intimate. Yunshi was good at painting, so he split the golden paper, toned the red grease, and painted four plum blossoms, with branches intertwined and hearts united at the bottom of the flowers. He also presented eight quatrains. His arresting lines were like "From this, the high style of Shangyang, a lifetime of joy and sorrow for plum blossoms," and "Recently, the heroic spirit has been exhausted, only painting plum blossoms to give to beautiful women." Without the style of a famous scholar, how could one achieve this?</p>
<p>Mountain chestnuts and olives thinly sliced and eaten together have the fragrance of plum blossoms. The ancients called it plum blossom脯.</p>
<p>Traveling to a famous plum blossom spot out of season is most regrettable. I once went to Wuxi Meiyuan with Shi Yu, when it was early winter and the plums were not yet in bud. However, the weather was cold and the air was solemn. Suddenly, it snowed incessantly. Shi Yu then had many feelings: "The heavens are busy embellishing, and the mountains are covered with snowflakes instead of plum blossoms." My friend Zhen Ya traveled through the lake out of season. When he arrived at Gushan, he did not see the shadow of the lean immortal. He also had a poem: "The fragrant time has passed, I stopped the car to visit the hermitage in Gushan. Why am I two or three months late? I expect there is no clear blessing to face the plum blossoms."</p>

<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chenglu</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai's passing of the old year was more lively than last year.</p>
<p>The terms used in writing and speech are often different: some call it (abolished calendar), belittling it; others call it (ancient calendar), loving it. But the treatment of this (calendar) is the same: settling accounts, worshiping gods, worshiping ancestors, setting off firecrackers, playing mahjong, New Year's greetings, (congratulations on getting rich)!</p>
<p>Even the newspapers that are published without stopping during the New Year have already had feelings; but, feelings are just feelings, and they can't beat reality after all. Some heroic writers have also called on people to work hard, grieve, and commemorate throughout the year. But, calling is just calling, and it can't beat reality after all. China has too many sad commemorations. At least it should be silent as usual; there are not a few happy commemorations, but again, some people are afraid of (taking the opportunity to make trouble), so everyone's happiness cannot be promoted. After several preventions and eliminations, all the festivals were strangled to death, so I feel that only this (abolished calendar) or (ancient calendar) that survives is my own thing, and it is even more lovely. That is an extraordinary celebration! This cannot be lightly dismissed with the phrase (feudal remnants).</p>
<p>Those who call on people to grieve and work hard all year round must not know grief and work themselves. In fact, those who grieve and work need rest and happiness from time to time.</p>
<p>I haven't celebrated the lunar New Year for twenty-three years, but this time I set off fireworks for three nights in a row, which made the foreigners next door (hiss) up: this and the fireworks have become my only happiness in the year.</p>
<h3>Prelude to 1934</h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>The first month of 1934 has slipped by in front of my eyes like this! Every day I wanted to write something, to leave a trace of life this month, but for some reason I always couldn't get up the interest to write. Occasionally, my conscience would condemn me too painfully, and I would walk into the room angrily, close the door, and lie on the table to write, but instead of scribbling in my diary, I would stare blankly at the books, and the article would still not come out.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are too many materials for articles, but I can't write a single word.</p>
<p>I dare not reread Te's letter. He hopes that I will work hard to create. I dare not even think of the expectations of several friends for me - expecting me to write more powerful works this year, to surpass everything in the past.</p>
<p>Today, a bigger difficulty is coming!</p>
<p>Ever since I came back, my sister-in-law has hoped that I would write more in a quiet environment where I don't have to worry about food for the time being, but I always lie to her: either saying I'm dizzy, or saying I have a stomachache, or my ears are ringing. She loves me very much. As soon as she hears that I have something wrong, she wants to accompany me to the hospital; heavens! I'm most afraid of taking medicine! How could I be willing to go? I had to say quickly: (It's okay, it's okay, it doesn't hurt anymore.)</p>
<p>(It doesn't hurt anymore, take a break and go write an article.)</p>
<p>I don't know how many times she has issued this ultimatum.</p>
<p>This morning in bed, she said to me: (Today, I'll have my cousin buy you a brazier to burn some white charcoal in your room to write articles, and take the thermos bottle too. Don't always play with me.)</p>
<p>(That's right, I was thinking the same thing. Day after day passes, and even I am too lazy to feel embarrassed.)</p>
<p>Saying this, my face was red - I felt it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her illness has not yet improved, and my stomach is hurting badly again, so the whole morning was spent in the hospital.</p>
<p>After lunch, I was drawing pillow flowers. My sister-in-law quickly snatched my pen and said to me with a serious and smiling expression: (I'll draw, and I'll make it for you when it's done. Don't worry about this. Hurry up and write an article. The brazier is already lit.)</p>
<p>While sitting on my chair, she called Liu's wife to move the brazier into my room. Helpless, I had to go with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>(How many words can you write in a day? Sister?)</p>
<p>When I walked into her bedroom to get a brush, she asked me this.</p>
<p>(Humph! If I don't write, it's fine. Once I start writing, it's at least 10,000,) I deliberately answered her very proudly. In fact, based on past experience, I have written more than 12,000 words in a day.</p>
<p>(Wow, amazing! Then let's cut it in half. I only need you to hand in 5,000 every day.) She smiled.</p>
<p>(Okay, but today is the beginning, let's reduce it a little bit. I'll only write 1,000.) I bargained with her like a businessman.</p>
<p>(No, it has to be 2,000. You're not allowed to come to my side if you haven't written it, and there's no food for you to eat.)</p>
<p>(I insist on writing only 1,000. See if you really don't give me food to eat.)</p>
<p>It's embarrassing to say, although I'm almost middle-aged, my mood is still like a child's. Maybe it's a sign of (uselessness)? I always live a child-like life.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Sitting down, the white charcoal in the charcoal basin is emitting a blazing light. I think if I don't write a few more lines, I will not only fail my sister-in-law's good intentions, but even my cousin and Liu's wife will be sorry for me.</p>
<p>Although the pen is in my hand, and the paper is ready, I am wholeheartedly thinking of writing a long letter to Gou, because Asia's two registered letters are on my table tempting me.</p>
<p>- Don't be so lazy. Wouldn't it be better to cheer up and write an article before replying?</p>
<p>The condemnation of conscience is more severe than anyone's stimulation.</p>
<p>After being silent for several minutes, I still can't write anything. I know this is because life has been too unstable for a month. I have been living in a wave-like environment every day. Everything is pressed tightly, and all I breathe is black smoke and white fog.</p>
<p>- You are too useless. Can't you create a new environment? The more unstable life is, the more you have to work hard to create. The more adverse the environment is, the more you have to work hard to struggle!</p>
<p>Yes, I have always maintained my beliefs, so let's swear to the brazier. My heart is always red, my blood is always hot, and my will is always strong! Although it is a snowy winter, I still have to move forward in the cold climate! No matter what, I want to complete the work that my friends hope I will write!</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>I can't write poetry, but I like to talk about poetry. When I have some feelings, I also entrust them to poetry. My peers may ridicule me, and I recite a poem to them:</p>
<p>Scholars consider themselves useless, this theory is unfair and I don't agree.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the world of lyrics in the Five Dynasties, mutual slaughter would be even more hateful.</p>
<p>This is Mr. Cai Yuanpei's inscription on Xu Zhongke's painting of filling in lyrics in Chunfei Pavilion. Those who heard it were refreshed. I recited another poem:</p>
<p>Why not spend all the wine money on wine? A moment of joy is worth a thousand years.</p>
<p>Relying on the railing, shouting loudly tonight, I won't sleep until dawn.</p>
<p>This is one of my poems written on the wall when I was drunk on New Year's Eve in a hostel in Nanjing seven years ago. A friend ridiculed it even more, thinking it was too vulgar. I smiled slightly and tried to explain it with vernacular poetry. My friend repeated his arguments and said, since you use the old style, you should use words with a source. I said, there are already three sources in the four sentences. Do you think it's too few? My friend said, "A moment of joy is worth a thousand years" is not really an idiom. I said that it comes from the Biography of He Shikai in the Book of Northern Qi. He Shikai once said to Emperor Shizu, since ancient times, emperors have all turned to ashes. What is the difference between Yao, Shun, Jie, and Zhou? It is better to enjoy life when you are young and strong, and do whatever you want. One day of joy is worth a thousand years. Why work so hard yourself?</p>
<p>Recently, the old New Year's Eve has arrived again, and my humble situation is still the same as before. Yesterday, I went to my brother Runquan's place for New Year's Eve dinner. I got excited by chance and drank three cups of yellow wine in a row. This morning, when I went to the toilet, I had a terrible bloody stool, and my豪氣 was less than it was in Jinlu that year. Among the poets of the late Qing Dynasty, I especially admire Jiang Taoshu, and I remember his playful work on New Year's Eve:</p>
<p>There are no plum blossoms in the corner of the courtyard, and the seat is not spring. Although the door is closed, how can it block poverty?</p>
<p>Late at night, the snowshoes sound in the deep alley, half of them are my family's debt collectors.</p>
<p>Someone came to calculate the rent, two thousand a month for a small three rooms.</p>
<p>If the house could be moved like a boat, I would go to the edge of Taihu Lake to avoid the noise.</p>
<p>Such poems can be called (poorly happy). My situation is similar to Taoshu's, but my bitterness and anger are deeper. How can it be said that he is virtuous and I am unworthy! Fan Fanshan's New Year's Eve poem in Yi Si year says:</p>
<p>More than two thousand years to this day, people are not allowed to celebrate the old New Year.</p>
<p>Can we not consider the poor scholars? The scholars have no share in selling spring couplets!</p>
<p>Now I will add a new twist to it, that is, even if the old calendar is not abolished, and the people are exhausted, and it is not enough to save the dying, even if the brush flies like a pen, what is the use of ten thousand spring couplets!</p>
<h3>Another Kind of Iron Window Flavor</h3>
<p>— Lin Xijun</p>
<p>Carrying a large package of cumbersome things, walking on that quiet night street. Making every passerby who has had this experience instinctively think of that one thing. When people used those eyes that seemed to be questioning and containing contempt! When staring closely at the thing under my armpit, and moving directly to my face, my heart couldn't help but twist, and at the same time I felt a kind of insult, and so I immediately glared at the other party without showing weakness.</p>
<p>Walking closer to the shop with a gold-lettered wooden plaque hanging on the door, I couldn't help but think of some ruthless, iron-faced faces inside. The heat all over my body suddenly cooled down, and my legs seemed particularly awkward, as if I was tripped by something. But the rumbling stomach, beating like a drum, became more energetic, and it was impossible to endure, so I had to try my best to muster up the courage to run in.</p>
<p>Seeing that there were already several people standing outside the iron fence, thinking that I was not the only one eating this bitter taste, my panicked mood suddenly calmed down subconsciously. But the authority figure in the iron fence glanced at my cumbersome package, and when he couldn't get it in through the iron fence, he frowned, showing a reluctant and annoyed expression, and opened the small iron door next to him, shouting loudly:</p>
<p>(Bring it up), followed by a very contemptuous look.</p>
<p>Holding back a mouthful of almost bursting anger, I silently handed him the thing.</p>
<p>After locking the door and opening the paper bag under the light, I was just about to say: (Five dollars), guess what he said? He (tsk)ed from his nose, and without even looking at it, he said coldly: (I don't want this kind of lousy stuff).</p>
<p>Like a bomb exploding beside me, my head almost swelled and went dizzy, and I hurriedly said softly: (Look carefully! It's always okay to exchange two or three dollars). It took a great deal of effort to say this, and the tone was almost pleading.</p>
<p>(Humph, what are you talking about, it's against my principles to even look at it. This stuff is fundamentally useless. Take it back).</p>
<p>The words came from the person standing high inside the iron fence, and those who heard these words were like prisoners listening to a sentence, shivering outside.</p>
<p>Looking painfully at the iron face again, to see if there was any room for accommodation. But that resolute refusal and that embarrassing expression didn't clearly tell me not to even think about it?</p>
<p>An unspeakable resentment attacked me, and the fire of anger immediately pierced through the top of my head. I almost wanted to drag that guy out and beat him a few times to vent my anger. But the thick iron fence stood proudly in front of me, dividing the inside and outside into two worlds. I had to sigh deeply.</p>
<p>Carrying the bitterness of disappointment, I walked out. Perspiration was constantly coming out of my forehead. I don't know where all the strength in my body had sunk. I just walked aimlessly with weak steps.</p>
<p>Along the way, I passed several shops with the same gold plaque hanging on them. I just wandered outside the door, wanting to go in but not daring to go in, and the leering face of that iron plate was still flashing in my mind. My heart was covered by ice, and I could no longer muster up the courage.</p>
<p>I just painfully gritted my teeth and left the door with the gold plaque for the fourth time</p>
<p>But the empty stomach that hadn't eaten a bite of food all day was shouting even more sadly, and I reached out and touched my bag, and as a result, I only found the remaining six coppers, and I couldn't even eat a sesame cake to be full.</p>
<p>(Five dollars), unbearable hunger drove me to reappear in front of the iron fence regardless of everything.</p>
<p>I waited anxiously for a response. The authority figure estimated the thing under the light as usual, once... and again... and finally looked at me and said unexpectedly: (It's only worth three dollars, do you want it)?</p>
<p>(Yes) I hurriedly agreed without thinking.</p>
<p>After filling my stomach, my spirits were also lifted a lot. I wandered home on the night road with a slight buzz after drinking. The night street was deep, and the wind in December was piercing. The half-empty red and green lights at the intersection wearily spread a hazy dream, just like my unsettled mood. My stomach was no longer complaining, so I hummed a vagabond tune like a dream, and slowly walked, wanting to temporarily forget all my thoughts, but in the end I couldn't get rid of that arrogant iron fence, and that cold and ruthless face inside the iron fence...</p>
<h3>I Curse That Smile of Yours (4)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>(Guo de er guo, guo de er guo, guo de...)</p>
<p>At the same time, he touched his butt with his right hand, still making a circle with his fingers.</p>
<p>(Egg! Egg!)</p>
<p>Everyone burst into laughter, clapping and laughing loudly.</p>
<p>The person who was carrying the bamboo basket and sulking also laughed so hard that the sweet potatoes fell out, rolling all over the ground. Her younger brother and sister quickly and happily chased after them to pick them up.</p>
<p>The landlady laughed until tears came out, and she shouted,</p>
<p>(Oh my god, oh my god.)</p>
<p>The old man who lay in bed smoking all day, this king, also laughed so much that he sat up from his throne and shouted energetically,</p>
<p>(Remember, remember! ... Ah, just now you said you were looking for (chicken mother)?)</p>
<p>Even he himself couldn't remember clearly, but he still instructed others seriously, then lowered his voice and corrected himself:</p>
<p>(Shouldn't it be (chicken crow)?)</p>
<p>While scratching his scalp.</p>
<p>(Chicken mother... Chicken rooster!)</p>
<p>The landlady, who was in high spirits, turned around to tease the old man.</p>
<p>(You... Humph, you know so much! ... People are buying mangoes!)</p>
<p>The old man tilted his head and squinted his eyes, also teasing back happily.</p>
<p>After this incident, whenever the children saw this Indian coming, they would stand far away and shout "Guo de guo" with a smile. Sometimes, they would deliberately squat on the ground, clap their hands, and imitate the way he laid eggs last time. This Indian, who was called "Guo de guo," could only smile embarrassedly and shyly.</p>
<p>Later, he accidentally found out that I understood a little English, so when he bought things, he would ask me to solve his difficulties.</p>
<p>For example, as soon as he entered the store, he would shout:</p>
<p>(Jie ma! Jie ma!)</p>
<p>Realizing it was not effective, he quickly looked for me and shouted.</p>
<p>(Hen! enH!)</p>
<p>After my explanation, he connected the Burmese word (Jie ma) with the Chinese word (chicken mother), and he got what he wanted without any effort.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever there was a matter of diplomacy, he would always come to visit me, this manure-sweeping fellow. And I also sometimes ran to his place to borrow some books to read; he had quite a few English booklets like Burmese myths and Indian stories.</p>

<h3>Silver Market Conditions During the Financial Holiday</h3>
<p>From January 10th to 16th, our newspaper was closed for the usual holiday period. However, the silver industry, although also closed, did not stop trading until the 14th. Therefore, there were still four trading days during the holiday period. We hereby supplement the record of the market conditions and transaction settlements for these four days as follows:</p>
<p>(Silver Dollar Discount) The morning and afternoon sessions on the 10th were both free loans. The 11th was also a free loan for both sessions. The 12th was also a free loan.

<h3>Exchange Rate Trend Between British and American Currencies is Rather Weak</h3>
<p>|Voices for the US to Raise Silver Prices are Growing Again|</p>
<p>During the closure period, the exchange market saw the London Telegraphic Transfer rate rise to 3225 for both near and far terms. The US dollar rose to 875. The pound sterling fell by a quarter against the US dollar and by one dime and two cents against the French franc. The US dollar rose by two and a quarter cents against the pound sterling, and both the US dollar and French franc rose. London spot gold rose by three pence. The opening selling price for the near term was weaker by .0625 for the pound sterling and stronger by .1875 for the US dollar compared to before the closure. After the opening, HSBC quoted the pound sterling at par and the US dollar rose by 125. However, due to news reports that the US would buy pure silver from mines at a silver price of $1.02, and private telegrams from Westerners stating that the US would raise the silver price to 64 cents, the trend gradually hardened. Subsequently, Chinese merchants continued to sell, and Cheng Feng Yong also supplied, making it even harder. But in the end, foreign news reported that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau denied that a solution to the silver price would be announced within three weeks. However, there were consecutive news reports that the president claimed there would always be a remedy for the silver price. Nevertheless, because Chinese merchants rushed to buy, it tightened slightly. At closing, the pound sterling was weaker by .375 and the US dollar was stronger by .875 compared to before the closure. Chinese merchants sold and then bought again, but they sold off quite a bit. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>The opening selling price for the pound sterling near term was 1 shilling and 4 and a half pence. Pan Gen sold May at 75. Macgregor bought June at .8125. HSBC took May at .8125 and sold to Hua Bi April at 75. HSBC took June at .875. Macgregor sold May at .8125. Hua Bi bought the same month at .875.

Then Mitsui consecutively sold June at 1 shilling and 5 pence. Hua Bi sold April at 1 shilling and 4 and thirteen-sixteenths pence. The closing selling price ranged from 1 shilling and 4 and five-eighths pence to 1 shilling and 5 pence. The buying price was increased by .0625.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Last Week's Government Bond Market Saw Mostly Rollover and Liquidation Transactions</p>
<p>Last week, from February 5th to 9th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was in its final week before the Lunar New Year, and trading only took place until Friday. The market was closed from Saturday until February 19th, with a total of nine days of closure in between. Therefore, before this period, traders who were long or short, and did not dare to wait nine days to see what would happen, all wanted to roll over or liquidate their positions. Moreover, after the market opened on the 19th, there were only four days left for February futures trading. Furthermore, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, it was customary to only trade two sessions in the morning for several days. So, in reality, there were only two days of trading last week, so most transactions were rollovers and liquidations. Large transactions were extremely rare, and there was very little new buying or selling. The general trend last week was mostly short rollovers, with a considerable number of liquidations. There were also some arbitrage transactions. On Monday, the "Demobilization" bonds suddenly saw a new high price of $68.05, and the rest also generally improved by three or four cents, due to short rollovers of bond No. 75. On Tuesday, because short rollovers of bond No. 75 continued, bonds No. 5, 20, and 50, etc., were all bought, and the market price rose another two or three cents to seven or eight cents. All items again discovered new high prices. On Wednesday, long positions slightly rolled over and exited, and the trend showed both highs and lows, but only by one or two cents. On Thursday, because long positions in bonds No. 4 and 43 sold off quite a bit, there was a small pullback of three or four cents. Friday was the last day, and there was still a lot of short covering, and the entire market rose by more than one dollar, again discovering a new high price of $59.50. The rest also rose by three to five cents each. As a result of the week, prices rose from several cents to one dollar and four cents. The total turnover was 59,573,000 yuan. The highs, lows, rises, and falls are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Last Year's Bond Market Overcame Adverse Environment</h3>
<p>Looking back at the government bond market over the past year, dangers emerged one after another. There were still many thorns in the diplomacy of North China, and the internal strife of the brothers was particularly frightening. In the spring, the Japanese attempted to attack Tianjin and Beijing, which lasted for almost two months. The government bond market was in a turbulent situation, with a significant drop. The public's panic was no less than the September 18th Incident. After North China was settled, not long after, there was the unusual act of Feng Yuxiang's army. Although the Feng Yuxiang affair was quickly quelled, Fang Jue's rebellion followed. Fortunately, it was handled very quickly, but the sudden changes and their completely different nature made bondholders feel terrified and unwilling to keep them. These were the major military upheavals. Other significant political changes included the resignation of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, rumors of the Southwest organizing a third government, rumors of Chiang and Wang's resignations, and the Hu case at the Fourth Plenary Session. These also caused significant concern. Minor incidents included changes in Xinjiang, the chaos in Sichuan, and Sun Dianying's armed uprising. These past events were fraught with danger, and the bond market was in an extremely adverse environment. However, at the end of the year, the prices of all bonds were at least 60% above par, not much different from the highest prices on July 19th of last year. This was truly a blessing for the country and a stroke of luck for the financial industry and bondholders. We should be grateful and attribute this to the appropriate handling by the authorities. With the internal unrest quelled and the external threats slightly reduced, the future of bonds has the potential for great success. This is because the number of people with securities knowledge has gradually increased over the years, while the commercial sector has declined, the rural areas have gone bankrupt, and there are more and more unemployed people. The uses of idle capital are becoming increasingly limited. The credit and guarantees of bonds are more solid than any other securities, so investors are flocking to them. The financial industry and major institutions all rely on this as their lifeline.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Market Reaches New High</h3>
<p>New York, February 9th telegram reports on the cotton market situation for the week: New York cotton continued to rise and created a new high, due to speculative buying. The factors that stimulated speculative buying were the prospect of cotton production control, the strong spot market situation, and the pro-long position cotton report. When the May contract price rose above 12 cents, a large number of long positions were liquidated, and there was some reactionary selling. However, industry insiders absorbed the selling when prices fell slightly. Some quarters expect the 12-cent price for the May contract to bring out 1-cent discount cotton. However, the fundamental price remains firm, and there are not many sellers. The sales of fertilizer lottery tickets in January were 75% higher than last year. At the same time, attention is generally focused on the cotton production management plan, which would impose heavy taxes on cotton production exceeding 9 million bales this season. It is said that cotton sales in the first three weeks of January exceeded 60% of production, and the number of unshipped orders as of January 17th was about seven weeks' worth of existing production.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Last Year's Silk Exports Increased Slightly</p>
<p>Shanghai silk mills resuming operations: There are a total of 113 local single and double cocoon silk mills in Shanghai. Due to the continuous slump in silk sales in Europe and America, the mills could not sustain themselves, and all of them closed down last winter. Since the new spring, only Baotai No. 1 and 2, Yongting, Hengcang, Fulun, and other five mills have managed to resume operations. Now that overseas silk sales are gradually turning around and silk prices are rising, the silk mills are resuming operations one after another. In the past half month, the single and double cocoon silk mills that have successively started their machines include Chuxin, Jingwei, Xiangsheng, Jiyu, Yuanxin, Yihe, Xinchang, Fengtai, Guangyuan, Fusi, and other thousands of mills. The total number of silk mills operating in the city has reached 15. More than 10 others, such as Houfu and Henglong, will also be preparing to start their machines in the coming days.</p>
<p>Statistics on Chinese silk exports: The quantity of raw silk exported from China last year showed a slight improvement compared to the previous year. However, due to fierce price competition from Japanese silk overseas, the value increase was limited. According to the Shanghai Customs' statistics for the whole year of last year (1933), a total of 209,101 bales of factory white, yellow, and gray silk, as well as waste silk, were shipped out. Compared to 147,624 bales in the previous year (1932), this is an increase of more than 50,000 bales. The silk value (last year) totaled 57,735,291 yuan, while the previous year was 50,069,463 yuan, an increase of more than 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk sales are difficult to boost before the settlement: During the newspaper's spring break, the business community is nearing the end of the year's settlement period. All inland silk factories must follow the usual practice of closing their accounts. In addition, due to the closure of the old calendar year, funds are extremely tight. Silk sales in the silk market are stagnant, and silk prices in the European and American markets are fluctuating, so few silk telegrams are sent to Shanghai. European firms' buying interest has softened, and current silk transactions are difficult to boost. During the break, only Renji and others shipped in 90 bales of factory yellow and white silk, the silk market shipped in 50 bales, and Indian firms shipped in 18 bales of yellow and white coarse silk. The price remains firm.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Record of Spot Yarn Market on the Day Before the Holiday</h3>
<p>The yarn market trended firm on February 10th, due to the continued high prices in the overseas cotton market. At the same time, raw cotton prices increased, leading to a very positive sentiment. Also, a certain factory intended to take in marked yarn, so the market felt more stable. The buying interest from the customer gangs was relatively smooth. According to the statistics of purchases by each gang, there were 456 bales purchased. The prices increased by 5 cents to 1 yuan. The purchase amounts and opening prices of each count by each gang are listed below:</p>

<h3>Sharp Decline in Spot Yarn Consumption Last Year</h3>
<p>Total Sales by Customer Groups: 237,191 Bales</p>
<p>A Decrease of 125,291 Bales Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn last year were significantly sluggish compared to the previous year. This was due to two main reasons: first, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the economic depression within the country led to a significant lack of purchasing power; second, the dumping of foreign yarn in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River became more intense, causing a major blow to the sales of domestic yarn. According to statistics, the total amount of spot yarn purchased by various customer groups throughout the year was only 237,191 bales, a decrease of 125,291 bales compared to the previous year. This clearly shows that sales in various regions have declined sharply. In North China, the position of domestic yarn has already been seized by Japanese yarn. As for the regions with the largest consumption, only South China remained relatively stable. However, in recent times, it has also been affected by financial pressures and warfare, leading to unspeakable commercial decline. Transactions in the cotton textile industry have stagnated, resulting in a significant reduction in raw materials. It is estimated that Guangdong province purchased only 47,175 bales of cotton yarn throughout the year, a sharp decrease of 50,182 bales compared to the previous year. Yunnan province purchased 19,777 bales, a decrease of 10,391 bales compared to the previous year. Shantou province purchased 18,094 bales, a decrease of 14,416 bales compared to the previous year. Sichuan province purchased 42,937 bales, a decrease of 19,183 bales compared to the previous year. Based on the above situation, it can be inferred that the significant decrease in yarn sales will make it difficult to stabilize market prices. According to the transaction volume of various customer groups in January, it was 11,599 bales; in February, 18,821 bales; in March, 13,801 bales; in April, 28,878 bales (the highest transaction volume); in May, 20,352 bales; in June, 19,507 bales; in July, 27,163 bales. Subsequently, during the autumn sales season, there was usually a period of growth. However, the autumn harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces saw extremely low prices for agricultural products, leaving the villagers still impoverished. Furthermore, banditry was rampant in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, and military affairs were unstable in Sichuan province, causing further disappointment in yarn sales. As a result, the transaction volume in August was only 15,754 bales; in September, 22,134 bales; in October, 27,548 bales; in November, 20,238 bales; and in December, 11,396 bales.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Presents a Big Sheep's Head to the Government</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th), the newspaper reported: "The Panchen Lama brought a sheep's head from Tibet this time when he came to Beijing, and respectfully presented it to the government..." Although the newspaper used flowery language to describe it as a rare treasure, and the government seemed hesitant to accept it, they eventually sent a representative to display it in the History Museum of the Academia Sinica. However, to ordinary people, especially livestock farmers who raise sheep, a sheep's head is just a sheep's head, and this is a dead sheep's head that has been slaughtered for a month! At this time of the New Year, when everything should be auspicious, how can a dead sheep's head be given as a gift? Moreover, the giver is the Panchen Lama, and the recipient is the National Government, which not only makes people exclaim in surprise, but also makes people suspicious and speculate about its mysteries! This is inevitable!</p>
<p>In fact, the significance of this gift of a big sheep's head is probably thousands of times greater than buying the most expensive gift certificates from the three major companies! Let us (at least I personally) try to imagine it:</p>
<p>"Sheep" represents "auspiciousness." In ancient times, the character for auspiciousness was written as sheep. Therefore, when people write auspicious words, especially when inscribing antiques, vases, longevity screens, and wedding gifts, they always remember the three characters "Da Ji Yang" (Great Auspicious Sheep) after writing "Wealth, Honor, Longevity." Based on this interpretation, the Panchen Lama's gift of a "big sheep's head" to our government implies that "the nation's destiny of great auspiciousness will begin from now on." The "now on" refers to the word "head." The sheep's head is "as big as a bamboo basket and three times the size of a sheep in the mainland," which shows that one sheep is equivalent to "three sheep." Mentioning "three sheep," with the national people's keen minds that always talk about auspiciousness and not misfortune, they can naturally associate it with the words "Kai Tai" (opening of prosperity)! This is the first great significance of giving the big sheep's head!</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, the Tibetan issue has been influenced by British forces extending directly from India, and has gradually formed a separate political system. In recent years, the Tibetan army has disobeyed orders and repeatedly invaded Sichuan and Kang provinces. The British are actively seeking to develop this mysterious "Tibetan Secret Country," and the call for this has become increasingly louder. Just when there was no way to deal with it, the Dalai Lama, one of the major political and religious leaders of Tibet, suddenly passed away. And the Panchen Lama, another major leader, who is like a bare-chested person wearing a kasaya, suddenly chopped off a (big sheep's head) from Tibet to offer to the National Government. Based on the example of "Duke Zheng baring his chest and leading a sheep in surrender," it can be predicted that no matter how the situation in Tibet changes, it will permanently submit to us and will not betray the country. In the end, it will still be a strong and unbreakable nation! This is the second great significance of giving the big sheep's head!</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been brutally seized by others, and the people of the country, from top to bottom, cannot but be angry and saddened! But what is the use of just being angry and sad without thinking of ways to remedy it? Moreover, the current border issues, such as the autonomy of Inner Mongolia, the declaration of independence in Southern Xinjiang, and the unresolved disputes in Kang and Tibet, all require the government to pay extreme attention and remedy them. But who can give such a powerful warning?</p>
<p>Alright! Now there is a big Tibetan sheep's head displayed in the History Museum by the government. Seeing the object and thinking about the situation, it will naturally think of the urgent need to "mend the fold after the sheep is lost" regarding the border issues! This is the third great significance of giving the big sheep's head!</p>
<p>In addition, there is the warning that the sheep's head can only be displayed and must not be hung up to sell dog meat; seeing the big sheep's head already displayed in Kyoto, one should think of the big fat sheep meat still far away on the border, etc. However, all of this depends on people's ability to think for themselves in order to glimpse the magnificent view of this big sheep's head!</p>
<p>"Repay a peach for a plum," and "courtesy demands reciprocity." The Panchen Lama has been away from Tibet for ten years, and with the recent passing of the Dalai Lama, he must have feelings of homesickness. Now that the government has accepted the gift from the old man, what will it give in return?</p>
<h3>Mistaken Train of Thought</h3>
<p>— Shu Gu</p>
<p>In this distorted society, all kinds of strange and deviant new things exist, without exception. Even the reproductive organs, which have always been considered the most mysterious, are actually encountering unprecedented misfortunes. If we borrow a newly created (?) term from Mr. [unclear], there is really a trend of "eunuch tide."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that a Mr. Zhou in Suzhou was so angry that his daughter was too romantic and had illicit affairs with as many as six or seven people, which was scandalous and disgraced the family. On the surface, there is some humor in this.</p>
<p>I still remember some time ago, a German elderly worker committed sodomy against a young child and was sentenced to one year in prison by the court. Not only that, but he was also subjected to castration. Although we feel that this is a bit too inhumane, but judging the matter on its own merits, we cannot help but say: "He deserved it."</p>
<p>It is not difficult to infer Mr. Zhou's painstaking efforts: he believed that his daughter's (reckless behavior) was due to poor family education and his own lack of strict management. In the final analysis, he only blamed himself for (his deep sins), so he resigned himself to castration in order to show responsibility. This spirit of introspection is worthy of admiration! By analogy, if everyone in our China could be like this, there would be no problems.</p>
<p>However, if we thoroughly analyze the cause-and-effect relationship of this issue, the blame does not lie with Mr. Zhou, nor should his daughter be blamed too much. In this time of rampant human desires, young women who have not been involved in the world for long are subjected to instinctive impulses and material temptations. At the same time, there is a bad environment, opening its bloody mouth and peeping beside them. Naturally, it is easy to fall into it involuntarily. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the current stage of real society. The social news pages of the newspaper every day are filled with records of this kind of bloody fact.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is another point that deserves our attention: after Mr. Zhou's castration, no one can be sure whether his romantic daughter will be greatly moved, temporarily reform, and return to the path of a good woman. If she still does not change her old ways, Mr. Zhou will ultimately sacrifice his lifelong happiness of (eating, drinking, and sexual desire) in vain, and he will inevitably feel some (self-reproach). Although an elderly German worker may sympathize with him, and although he may win the reputation of (comrade) when he meets Sima Qian in the afterlife, he cannot find any other compensation.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou made a mistake in his thinking because he could not grasp the issue of (whose responsibility this is), and he mistakenly turned a thought. Therefore, this foolish castration is a very sad策, isn't it?</p>
<h3>The Most Miserable People in the World</h3>
<p>— Jian She</p>
<p>In this era of advancement, who isn't shouting:</p>
<p>(The pain of life, the pain of life!)</p>
<p>Yes, life is painful! This isn't the idle cry of ordinary people, nor is it the delirium of the neurotic. Life determines the meaning of humanity; humans are beings of suffering. How many great philosophers and writers have used meticulous observation to write this page of life, substituting for millions upon millions of people, and have long cried out this sound: (Life is painful!)</p>
<p>However, we believe there are some dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>At a cursory glance, life is indeed painful, and everyone has their share. But this is too general, and it includes all of humanity too completely. In my opinion, the taste of life, while not as worth celebrating, fulfilling, and joyful as optimists would have it, the so-called pain is definitely not the same for everyone.</p>
<p>1.  There is a section of the lower classes who could have accomplished something, but because of the不良 of society, they cannot make a living. They simply stand idle, mouths full of vulgar tunes, their dinner entirely dependent on gambling and extortion. They cannot bully the big shots, so they specialize in extracting a living from the local commoners. These kinds of people are truly numerous in Shanghai. Their influence is almost everywhere in the streets and alleys. The lives they lead are precarious, surviving by stealing life, and they are among the most miserable people.</p>
<p>2.  Prostitutes and waiters, in terms of lifestyle, they appear to be a well-off group, but their spirits are truly incomparably painful. We should not assume that a prostitute's selling of her body is a mutually satisfying thing. In reality, many of them receive customers while secretly shedding tears, in order to earn a few stinking coins to live and support their families. The waiters, with their fawning faces, entertain guests, but aren't they just like a wagging-tailed poodle? The lives these people lead are also most painful.</p>
