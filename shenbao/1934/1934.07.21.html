<p>去歲意前航空部長巴爾波氏結飛行隊長征美陸。舉世震動。英美軍事專家。以爲巴爾波之成功。使軍事學開一新天地。蓋結隊飛行之軍事上價値。其伸展將無限量。近者美國海陸軍用飛機十二架。復作沿太平洋岸之飛行。陸軍轟炸機十架。已於今日由華盛頓出發。而其目標爲阿拉斯加半島附近之戏諸小島。此事在軍事上及政治上意義。有足注意者。</p>
<p>美國國防計畫中之理想敵爲日本。蓋爲世人所明知。自美至日。道阻長。其間軍事形勢。雙方已研究綦詳。美如對日作戰。可取三途。一則美國海軍。沿南太平洋之海道以前。二則沿中太平洋經過日委任統治區之加羅林諸島。三則沿北太平洋之亞拉斯加海岸。第一路線。美國在沿途之設備。最爲薄弱。雖有三馬亞島爲美領。然大部分島嶼。屬於英國。澳洲。或錫蘭。美艦長征。多賴沿途之停泊處與油棧。而取道於此。最爲危險。</p>
<p>第二路線。自舊金山至夏威夷其屬於美國海軍勢力之完全支配下。蓋無欵義。然自夏威夷至菲列賓或上海。其間小島縱橫。出於海面者。有日本於大戰以後受國際聨盟委托統治之所謂南洋諸島。凡此諸島。日本築防禦工作。不遺餘力。且其天然形勢。宜於築飛機塲及砲台。雖國聨盟約。明定此處之不許築軍事工程。然據調查。日本已悍然爲之。美國艦隊。欲圖向西進展。則此橫絶中太平洋之小島地帶。難於通過。數月前美國之海軍飛機。自舊金山直飛夏威夷。依預定吿成。日本方面。已引以爲慮。然此僅屬於東太平洋地帶。而日本久自認爲非其所欲染指之區域也。</p>
<p>至第三路線。則近頗引起軍事家之注意。此路線者。沿西雅圖至亞拉斯加海岸。經白林海而逹日屬之千島列島。以及於北海道及本州者也其途徑爲最短。而海軍與空軍合作之機會亦最多。三年前林白大尉之自美至亞卽沿此線。而當時日本人士申申詈之。以爲林白之來。有軍事上之作用。按日本於亞拉斯加及其附近之亞留仙羣島。注意已久。漁船游艇之至此者。往往負有偵探及測量之使命。美國近亦計畫於諸島上闢大規模之飛機塲。美日之注意點均集中於此。則此次美軍用飛機十二架自聖地安哥飛此。其在軍事上之使命與作用。不容、吾人忽略也。</p>
<p>抑尤有可注决者。軍事之計算。往往涉及政治問題。而吾人眼前最有興趣之問題。卽加拿大在此段飛行線中之地位是也。明理者。莫不知美國本陸與其領土之亞拉斯加之間。有加拿大自治帮之存在。今美飛機北駛。非經加拿大之領空不可。且依此次之計畫。飛機沿途設站。則加拿大之境域。更不免有美國軍用機之停留。加拿大者英之子國也。然政治上雖屬英。經濟上及地理上。則已爲美國之一部份。使美日一旦有事。則加拿大之中立不能維持。而英帝國之鞭策。益將難乎其難矣。</p>
<p>湯尼皮者。英之現代最有習之國際學家也。於前屆汎太平洋學會上。指加拿大爲最危險之地帶。彼意蓋謂一旦美日發生戰爭。加拿大必先捲入漩渦。而英領哥侖比亞一帶。將首見飛機與炸彈。今美飛機之飛亞拉斯加。假道於加拿大。則他年戰爭發生。加拿大如守中立。必不許美機之侵入其領空。不然。日本將指加拿大之不盡中立國義務。而以交戰國相待。使加拿大保護其領最高法院判决</p>

<h3>日本岡田内閣的軍備（日本通信）</h3>
<p>强化軍事實力廢棄官署中心拔擢靑年將校專重部隊勤務岡田内閣、是齋藤内閣的延長、應該繼承齋藤以往的政策、然這次岡田内閣、標着所謂人才主義、實行官僚主義、選援事務上的專門家、對於政黨、祇是表面敷衍、如政友會以三百名大多數的議席、僅祗分配得閣席三個、由此可見所謂專門家勢力的抬頭（實際上是官僚與軍部勢力的抬頭、）在另一方面、就反映出政黨勢力的衰落、現在政友會、很想乘機恢復舊有政治勢力、所以毅然將參加組閣的床次竹二郎·山崎逹之輔·内由信也·三人、開除黨籍、在政友會内、似乎還因此减少了牠自已内部的予盾、大有死灰復燃的樣了、不過牠有兩個很大的弱點、第一·日本人民對於旣成政黨城市上的勞苦大衆、早就深惡痛絶、詛咒牠快些死亡、到現在自然不會帮助牠、農材的民衆、也很厭棄政黨、所以無論如何、政友會總是得不到多數人擁護的、第二·財閥是立黨的基礎、可是他們現在都轉而投降軍部、軍部卽根本不要政黨政治、於是牠失去了靠山、不敢直立起來作公明的政治鬥爭、祇是稍微呼喊呼喊而已、</p>
<p>至於軍部、那就大大的不同了、在岡田組閣之初、就有了切實的諒解、要新内閣承認其所謂國策、在海軍方面、是以擴大海軍來應付海軍縮小會議、在陸軍方面、是以充實國防、應付非常事變、關於海軍的事、留待將來再說、現在先報吿陸軍方面所謂的國防充實、首先要作的事、是準備增加常備軍師團、除開事實上駐東三省四個師團添加了四個留守師團之外、還打算要增加四個師團的常備兵、其次是要將滿洲的政治經濟、藉經濟聨盟的美名、完全置諸關東軍司令管理之下、日本陸軍的傳統習慣、是着重中央集權、所以凡是作軍官的人、如有閥閱的關顧、貴族華族的情誼、則直接帶兵的時間、就非常之短、因此旅團長以下的直接帶兵官、往往終身不遇、而且遷升很慢、特别是幾多年沒有戰爭、更無從建立戰功、卽有才能、也無從表現、所以有許多靑年軍人、都不很願意帶兵、而願意服務於參謀本部·敎育總監部·陸軍省等中央機關、纔有自已表現的機會、同時他們學籍的限制、在學時代名次的順序、也是升遷的主要條件、然而九一八以後、事實上略有變更、出征軍隊、有了特殊的機會、其地位就轉變爲非常重要、加以現時正積極備戰、更要引起一般靑年軍官的功業心、假如再像從前一樣、死守官僚主義、則戰爭前途、就很少勝利的把握了、</p>
<p>經過了陸軍三長官（參謀總長·敎育總監·陸軍大臣·）幾度恊商的結果、認爲要作非常時期的準備、除了軍事上積極整備之外、人事方面、也需特殊的更新一番、纔能提起靑年軍官的勇氣、纔能和牠的假想敵相競爭、於是要一掃現時上層的沉滯空氣、（實際上是攺換成淸一色的主戰派、并且是積極的主戰派）、所以實行淘汰、乘今年秋季的定期調動、更換大批的高級將校、至於中堅層將校由少佐至大佐這一類靑年軍人、是日本現時軍部中最有實力·最活動·而且是侵略主義最濃厚的人物、他們在中央、是有力的實行者、在部隊中更是組織的樞紐、所以現在决定要打破從前的學歷關係、把重心移到部隊裹面去、以後少佐中佐級、要在部隊裹服務一年以上、聨隊長（大佐）則須勤務二年以上、使現役將校、都熟悉部隊情形、能够擔任實際戰爭的指揮、由此可以明白看出日本軍部的備戰、是何等的積極、（七月十四日於東京）</p>

<p>昨在唐有壬宅會商討論華北中日外交但均不願發表内容遠東社云、本埠甘世東路甘村外次唐有壬宅、昨一度舉行會議、自上午九時四十五分開始、直至中午十二時十分始散、參加者、除唐氏本人、及甫經由杭到滬之北寗路局長殷同、又日前由閩抵滬之平政整會委員李擇一外、並有日使館華文參贊有野學、雖各人所發表之談話、均否認爲舉行會議、而曰祇在便談、但衆信渠等之會晤、必爲討論華北中日交涉、爰分誌所得各情如次、</p>
<h3>殷同到滬</h3>
<p>殷氏於前日下午、下莫干五抵杭後、卽乘搭五時五十山分特快車來滬、當晚十時三十五分抵埠、悄然在北站下車後、卽逕至天潼路新亞酒店、化名劉姓、在該酒店七樓、關室下榻、</p>
<h3>會議經過</h3>
<p>先是有野學氏、於九時四十五分、首先驅車至唐宅、旋殷同氏後有野氏五分鐘、乘黑牌工部局照會二零二四號·公用局照會六一八三號汽車趕至、於是會議開始、迨至十時五十分、有野卽辭出、嗣李擇一氏趕到參加、直至十二時十分、殷李二氏始行同出、會議亙時逾二句鐘之久、至會議内容究竟、各人諱莫如深、諉稱爲「隨便談談」、</p>
<h3>有野談話</h3>
<p>據有野氏出唐宅時、語遠東社記者、本人來訪唐次長、並無公務接洽、僅爲拜候性質、緣前此有吉公使偕本人晋京時、曾蒙汪院長及唐次長設宴欵待、今悉唐次長到滬、特來道謝、有野氏語至此、記者轉叩以日方對於廢除塘沽恊定之態度、當據答稱、此乃地方問題、將逕由地方當局處之、換言之、是卽關東軍當局與華北地方當局間事、將來如有交涉、由該二者進行、兩國中央、則僅從旁監視云云</p>
<h3>李擇一談</h3>
<p>當李擇一氏甫抵唐宅時、遠東社記者亟上前叩詢、據談、本人因悉唐次長到滬、特來訪問、初不知唐宅有何會議、繼謂、閩省情形、現尙安靜、外傳日人在閩圖謀種種、未免言之過甚、不足置信、華南日領、在台灣會議、原屬每年例舉、至其今次會議之内容、吾人當無從洞悉、李氏旋並吿記者、陶尙銘氏、余知渠並未赴長春、今日（卽昨日）報載津電、傳渠遄赴長春商戰區事云云、實非確辭云云、</p>
<h3>殷同談話</h3>
<p>殷同氏出唐宅時、向記者作如下之談話、首稱、黃委員長（郛）現仍堅持消極、蓋以其意見不能實現故、目前尙難望渠打銷辭意、惟各方以大局爲前提、得使渠之意見能予實現、則渠之辭意、自可打銷也、旋謂、本人此來訪晤唐次長、不過「隨便談談」、</p>
<h3>唐有壬談</h3>
<p>嗣記者復於下午、前訪唐有壬氏、唐氏對渠與殷等會晤、亦否認爲舉行會議、謂有野氏來訪、係爲道謝渠與有吉公使前此在京領受汪院長之招待、並未談及共他、至殷同氏之來訪、亦僅略談敦促黃膺白先生之北返事、惟有野與殷同二氏適相値、渠等當曾趁便另室略談、李擇一氏、因悉余來滬、特來便談而已、云云、</p>

<p>今夜可到上海海關昨懸信號今日當再鳴砲颶風自台灣洋面吹過、向西北西急進、昨據天文台續吿、揚子江中游有陣雨、上海附近六時有陣雨、東海天氣惡劣、且有大旋風、颶風於昨晨、向福州沿海面吹進、其方向仍爲西北西、預料該颶風到福州海面後、便向浙江洋面推進、而來上海、風力極爲猛烈、共有四個風頭、其吹進之方位、係在東經一二○度北緯二六度、滬上各輪公司得報、對於航行在途之滬閩班、浙海班、南華班、及普陀班、等各輪、已各將此警吿、轉電各船、迅爲預防、下午五時、江海關又懸掛颶風將來之警吿信號、日間一黑球、夜中一紅燈、通知在浦江内未經開駛各船、預爲防範、以免臨時不及、浦面舳舨民船貨駁等、於下午五時後、多駛進蘇州河老港暫避、各江海輪船之在滬者、亦各抛雙練錨、並增加繫泊力、惟滬甬班輪新寗紹等、及其他浙江沿岸各班輪、仍各照常駛出、俟到吳淞後、再候天文台警吿、據聞颶風今夜可到上海、浦江航輪民船、已各事先戒備、海關係得到颶風確切到滬之警訊、當再鳴砲示警、各公司之南華班輪、均各在途中抛避、進口期均須遲誤云、</p>
<p>榮宗敬</p>
<h3>昨赴公司辦事</h3>
<p>休養一週健康恢復照常負責主持業務華東社云、實業巨子榮宗敬氏、前因身體不適、退居休養、並推請福新總公司副經理王禹卿·及棉業統制委員會李升伯·兩君、分别主持麵粉及紗廠方面事宜、自榮氏退休後、社會方面、頗有影響、實業部方面、對之頗爲注意、曾擬設法整理補助、昨日、本埠方面、忽又盛傳榮氏又重至公司負責料理事務、華東社記者、因特向該公司探訊、據該公司文牘主任孫北萱君談、榮先生前因身體多病、特退居休養、並挽請本公司副經理王禹卿先生主持麵粉部份、棉業統制委員會李升伯主持紗廠部份、惟因王君身體亦感不適、李君本人因任務忙繁、無暇兼顧、故均謙辭、王君並已數日未到公司辦事、而榮先生因有一星期之休養、身體業漸痊可、故於今日（卽昨日）上午九時、蒞公司照常負責辦事、各項事務、遂同時恢復以前狀况、外傳種、則已成過去矣、</p>
<p>麵粉廠商</p>
<h3>危險時期過去</h3>
<p>大批麵粉出口尤以東北爲多中央社云、麵粉廠商、前因麵粉價格慘跌、以致發生恐慌、而若干工廠、并因此不得不宣吿减工、實業部方面、曾派員來滬調查、與各廠商會商救濟辦法、記者昨晤麵粉界鉅商、據談、麵粉廠商之所以發生恐慌、完全由於出品無銷路之故、現在麥價較爲便宜、則成本較輕、推銷亦較易、近來曾有大批麵粉、輸送出口、尤以東北爲多、故以目前觀察、麵粉界危險時期已過去、各廠商亦均已恢復舊有狀態云、</p>
<h3>莫干山訪黃紀</h3>
<p>＝黃以事與願違流露消極口吻政會棘手由於枝節問題太多＝新新社記者、以華北政務重要、而黃郛滯留莫干山、冠蓋往來、殆無虚日、必有政聞、因之特親赴莫干山、此行計謁及黃郛殷同兩人晤談之下、始知華北之事、初非簡單、今已記者之見聞及感想、歸滬後、拉雜書之、想亦閱者所急欲知之也、華北之事、去年在軍事期間、產生政委會、秉承中央意志、恊助地方政府、其第一件工作、即輔助軍分會、辦理塘沾恊定以來、收回濼東各縣、幸已完畢、然名爲戰區、而一切善後、實尙無具體辦法、蓋我方旣受限制、而土匪浪人遂多竊發、取締爲難、現茲編練特警、即爲治安關係、至於趙雷·劉佐周·等部必須重加訓練、將來調出戰區、　無問題、夫</p>
<h3>軍事恊定</h3>
<p>爲臨時局部之事、現者相距二年、戰事早止、此後一切、必須遵常規而行、方有辦法、而現在以停戰恊定之故、凡戰區一切事件、必須以關東軍爲對象、豈是長久之道、况外交本爲國家整個之事、於砲火之下、有停戰恊定、而現談到戰區善後、則一切交涉、自應由軍事轉之外交、局部轉至中央、方有澈底整個之辦法、以記者想來、即停戰恊定又何嘗非秉中央而爲之、則現今由局部外交轉至整個國家之對日交涉、亦屬事理之一貫、應不難實現者也、至於其他華北瑣事正多、即如東陵問題、日方每每藉口出兵、不知陸寢係屬古跡、以現代</p>
<h3>文明國家</h3>
<p>旣不罪及妻孥、安能遷禍枯骨、其爲藉口、實屬顯然、好在現今已預備邀集前淸宗室之未附僞國者、共組保管會矣、至於日人方面、則以停戰恊定之故、目灤東等如戰區、必欲以軍事方面出乎交涉、是其重視關東軍部、乃至不欲轉換外交之常態、可以想見、然華北爲中國之一部、必欲以局部與人家軍事機關討論交涉、勢多困難、不言可知、而政委會之棘手、實亦由於枝節問題之太多、故黃郛以息影莫干山多年之人、重膺繁劇、而又間有事與願違之感、故不免每每流露消極之口吻也、蓋事可圖成、政與策合則犧牲自已、本無足惜、若明知不可、如不宜爲而爲之、則素號難進易退之人、又何必爲尸位素餐之舉乎、至於目下、恊定</p>
<h3>尙未廢除</h3>
<p>對手仍爲關東軍之時勢、亦不能不與辦交涉、而枝枝節　節之事、又非醫頭醫足所可了、好在最後之决定與進行之方案、自有中央主持　之也、正事談完、記者遂蠟展山水間、一　莫干山之勝、風景優美、無足贅述、而山脚下庚村之</p>
<h3>莫干小學</h3>
<p>則有足紀載者、學爲黃郛所創舉、已有多年、志在普及敎育、招收農家子弟入學、往者農家輒有讀即廢耕之感、而此校則雙方兼顧、春耕之際、放學回家、農作旣畢、再行入學、而延長暑假、以爲補足、故本年暑假、至十九日始舉行、余得參閱其盛、屋舍儼然、中爲禮堂、上懸耕讀一字、以爲敎訓、聨</p>
<p>曰、自治自衛自敎養、相友相助相扶持、農村合作之精神、於此可見、是日到者數百人、學生及家長咸集、濟濟一堂、禮儀爲盛、向者山足庚村、本無人家、今日有此校、而屋舍比比、可知事在人爲、而記者得覩此耕讀並重之學校、其欣感視較參觀任何大學爲有興味也、故附記之、</p>
<p>日軍部</p>
<h3>不滿日使有吉</h3>
<p>謂其對華認識不足十五日大阪每日新聞載稱、軍部方面、對華外交之動向、自華北通車問題解决後、對國民政府、堅持嚴密監視態度、然最近頻傳寗粤合作、將請胡漢民入京、此種消息、恐非可靠、而駐華有吉公使、竟信以爲眞、迭向當局報吿、軍部以有吉公使認識不足、頗爲憤懣、主張更選駐華公使、且一九三六年之危機已迫、林陸相提倡外交機能之擴大强化、希望外國使認識不足、頗爲憤滿、主張更選駐華公使、且一九三六年之危機已迫、林陸相提倡外交機能之擴大强化、希望外國使臣之適切有效措置、惟外務當局、務生如何反響、殊堪注目云、</p>

<h3>關於文學槪論（續）</h3>
<p>答周筠君潘著文學槪論，自然不是一本什麽完善的讀物。因爲它是由作者的幾篇講稿和幾篇談文學的零碎文章編集起來的，並不是系統的著作。所以在編製上，旣嫌究有順序，在剪裁上也嫌太煩瑣，而且作爲一本文學槪論看，内容也還不够充實。譬如，文學起源和創作方法法是每本文學槪論所要觸到的主要課題，但在這裹，關於文學起源，只順便在第一講中提出了一點，即所謂衝動說，而沒有把這問題展開論及，至創作方法，也只在附錄中，「怎樣研究文學」一文中約略說到，然而這些缺點，我們以爲却並不足以使周君感到可怕和糢糊。</p>
<p>作者對於文學的認識，在現在看，我們可以說，是不十分正確的，他是人生藝術派，他認文學是「自我的表現」，是「人的自覺」，文學的要素，是個人的感情和想像，思想不過是與感情有密切關係而已。他贊成泰納的主張，以文學是由環境，種族，時代三者產生出來的，然而泰納的主張，却早被蒲列汗洛夫攻破了。因爲泰納沒有看到社會階憎的决定作用，所谓環境，種族等是在社會階層的支配下發生它的相當影響。文學不是「自我的表現」而是「社會生活的反映」，不是一人的自覺」而是「社會階層的自覺」，潘先生從文學中見到」人生」而不見到决定人生的社會，於是便造成了本書觀點上的主要缺陷。</p>
<p>雖然這樣，通過本書，我們相信，作者並不是專把别人不同的意見東抄西襲，凑攏起來，而是有其一貫的主張的。文學是「追求完滿的人生」和「文學是由文字的形式表現生命的純感情」這兩句話，可以代表作者整個意見，周君之感到糢糊，我以爲是周君沒有把他的文章看淸。（前面說過因爲剪裁不好，所以不容易看到文章的主旨在那裹。）周君接連舉了十幾條「文學是····」的話，以爲這些會使人糢糊。其實，這些話，有的只是作爲主要意見的解釋，有的是有意舉出想反的意見證明自已主張的眞確，如果周君把每句的上下文連貫起來仔細一看，是决不致於糢糊的。譬如：周君所舉「單單表現的好，也不失爲文學作品」明明是要引出下面的「但沒說到文學的全體」（原書三十七頁）一名。又如：當周君看到「情感是主觀的，沒有個性光只三種東西｜指環境，種族，時代｜是絶不能產生情緖的」（見原書十九頁）如果再看下</p>
<p>面一段，不不會懹疑到潘君旣極力贊成奉納，文在主張個性。至於所謂「古典派「」浪漫派「」自然派「乃是說明文學的變遷，乃是說明一時代有一時代的文學。文學不是死的東西，而是隨差社會的發展而發展的。現在流行着新寫實主義，是因爲現時代，現社會有產生新寫實主義的客觀原因，要投向到舊時代的古典派浪漫派的憉裹去是不可能的，這又怎麽會使周君糢糊呢？周君讀書，絶不要去尋章指句，咬文嚼字，應該冷靜地逐段逐句讀下去，才能看出文章表達的主要意思是什麽。該書列舉了許多哲學和社會科學之類的書，而使周君感到可怕，也是周君的誤解。前面曾說過，文學槪論是在使初學者對於文學有一個槪念，和指給一條研究的路。一本文學槪論，把與研究文學有深切關係的書介紹給讀者是非常必要的，但這裹却並不限定凡讀文學槪論的，一定要讀所介紹的書。這全要看：周君如果對於文學要有深造便不能不照着所介紹的書目讀下去；（周君所舉的高爾基雖然是流浪兒，但對於學間也是下過苦功的。）如果周君只求對於文學有一個槪念，那儘可不問所介紹的書目如何複雜，置之不理好了。何况，讀書雖然一定要爲我們的經濟時間所局限，但以經濟時間局限，來作爲不讀書的理由，我們覺得是不充分的，我們應該從極艱苦的環境中，爭取讀者的權利。我們希望周君不要存着這種可怕的心理。</p>
<p>總之，潘著文學槪論是有缺點的：然而如周君所說感到糢糊，感到可怕周君自已却應該負大部分責任。</p>
<p>在目前，關於文學槪論之類的書，求其完善可讀的還不多有。開明書店出版本間久雄的新文學槪論，雖然内容很豐富，但觀點旣不健全，且又兼收並蓄，一無主見，實非初學者所宜讀。其他，更無可取。我們以爲，倘周君需要再讀一本較好的槪論，戴叔淸編的文學原理簡論，雖然嫌簡單，還不失爲初學者較可讀的讀物。（完）</p>

<h3>「黑白渡河」</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>洋大人眞是厲害，處處都想盡了法子作他們的侵略的宣傅。在學術上，在商業廣吿上，他們都宣揚他的作侵略者的「正當性」。</p>
<p>在舊的人類學，言語學上，都表露着他們的侵略的「意狄歐羅奇」。那已爲新的人類學者，言語學者所否定了。洋大人復活起來綠瓦朱欄的中國的封建建𥴌，暗示着中國一些人向後退。</p>
<p>最近，看見了某肥皂公司，徵求一種答案的有獎的廣吿，可是裹邊的含義间不很簡２單的，題目呌做「黑白渡河。」</p>
<p>「黑白渡河」大意是這樣。棕村和欖村中聞是一條河。有三個白人和三個黑人要從棕　村渡到欖村，可是，河内只有一隻小船，其中只能坐二個人。而只有三個白人和一個小黑人能撑船。并且，渡到欖村或留在棕村之黑人數不得超過白人。因爲三個黑人都吃人，都會吃白人。</p>
<p>這個算術問題，是很有趣味的。我想有些人，特别是婦孺，一定津津有味地去研究他的。而且可以發財，更適合了我們的財迷主義。研究的人，應徵的人，一定不少。可是在不知不覺間，一定有好些人會信黑人是眞會吃白人的。於是，洋大人的大功吿成了。</p>
<p>其實，是誰吃人呢？是黑人呢？還是白人呢？我白聽見過有黑奴，未聽過有白奴。其實，把「黑白渡河」中的黑人同白人掉換一下，倒還適當</p>
<p>人人人都會吃人的。侵略者是某一部分人。</p>
<p>侵略者是專會造謠的。據從法國回來的友人說，法國敎堂裹懸着救濟中國兒童義捐箱。他們說，中國兒童受苦，要他們來救濟，可是，理由是什麽呢？說是中國人用小孩子喂猪。若不救濟，快喂光了。可是，用小孩子喂猪，在中國，是不是有呢？天曉得！慈善的背後，就是正當化侵略的存在理由。</p>
<p>對於侵略者，我們是要反抗的。我們更要時時刻刻細心地防備着他們所散播的細菌。</p>
<h3>關於學生們的性生活</h3>
<p>— 徐訏</p>
<p>假如一個靑年，他在戀愛的時候想像結婚，我相信，她的想象一定要幻滅。</p>
<p>假如一個靑年不能將結婚與戀愛分開來理解，那末，　在戀愛失敗之日，是嘗到戀愛失敗之痛苦，在戀愛成功之日，則嘗到了結婚失內之痛苦了！</p>
<p>情死與離婚的原因多在此。</p>
<p>戀愛像遊一個花圍，結婚則像整理一個花園；戀愛像鑑賞一朶艷花，結婚則像培植一株艷花！</p>
<p>戀愛時候，大家打扮自已，一星期一次伴愛人到電影院去，到公園去，逛山去，遊水去，這是有趣的，但是你以爲結婚以後，這些事情更容易舉行，舉行得更加自由而有趣，這就更根本錯誤了。</p>
<p>戀愛是開花，結婚是結果，二者是二加事，但同時也是一回事。太看二回事，則把結婚看成機械，看成了勉强；太看成一回事，則看錯了結婚的意義。</p>
<p>結婚是結束自已，準備孩子的生命，要顧到孩子的幸福了，否則你必需離婚。</p>
<p>中國智識靑年，戀愛的時間太長，結婚太晚，所以只就那戀愛的甜密，負不起結婚之鎖枷。</p>
<p>戀愛是浪漫的，結婚是寫實的。</p>
<p>戀愛可以使你超脫了現實的社會，結婚可以觸到現實的社會。</p>
<p>戀愛像酒，結婚飯，多喝了酒，就嚥不下飯了。</p>
<p>結婚是一種組織，是一種訓練，是一種建設。結婚的愛不是戀愛的加深，不光是量的增加。而是質的攺變。</p>
<p>假如要把中國智識靑年納入軌道，早婚，或者是一個辦法，高中畢業，就應當結婚！當然，爲公園電影塲的生意，你不當這樣去提倡，但假如娛樂是屬於人，不是人屬於娛樂，那麽結婚是能將娛樂納入正確的意義。</p>
<p>我討厭，那班不是爲看電影而去電影院，不是爲走公園而去公園的人們！</p>
<p>主張晚婚的人，應當先要使靑年「晚戀愛」，像瑞士大學裹的校風一樣，才是根本辦法。十五六歲就戀愛起的中國靑年，要呌他們三十歲才結婚，將他們的性情在這樣悠長戀愛期間弄成輕浮，浪漫，不負責了，他們的學業也再難有所成就了。</p>
<p>大學裹，女子打扮得像花，男子忙碌得像；一個大學，常常是戀成一個花園與蜂房。「花王」，「皇后」一類的名字，終像是花園與蜂窩的產物。</p>
<p>大學生只知道超脫現實社會，他們不但不能進社會，他們連把二個人組織成一個家庭，都沒有能力；他們根本不知道組織，不知道預算；不知道用手，只知道用五官。他們能爲愛人買糖菓，買電影院與公園的門票，但是他們沒有能力開一張稍煩的賬單，一樣一樣去買齊。</p>
<p>所以中國在　科學上少貢獻，在文學上少偉大作吕；政治上只有活動而無團結</p>
<p>而無黨外之黨！</p>
<p>你可以看星期日以及稍長的假期，所有大學生都在電影院與公園裹頭消磨，很少能作較遠的旅行，或者是登一個較高的山峯，逹到聞名的山均的。</p>
<p>大學生，女的出來個個是明星，男的出來個個是捧角家！我是看得太倦了！許多老人家說，以前女的侍候丈夫讀書，現在女的只知伴男人玩！我想，早婚是有補益的。這並不是呌我們的明星來伴男子讀書，實在，捧角家也當伴女子讀書的。｜｜究竟你們都是有書讀的人呀！</p>
<p>是的，大學裹，女生太少也是一個靑年不安的原因；許多轉體，不用諱言，是爲拉攏女生而產生的，不過你要知道，戀愛與結婚不同，一個人有一個愛人，同一個人一個妻子是不同的。這裹决不是肯定地主張一夫一妻制的意思，只是說，這般大學生如果不在性生活方面安定，實在是太不雅觀了｜｜一羣羣，像春光裹的雌狗！</p>
<p>也有人說到金錢的費省上來，那眞是一件値得報吿的事情，一個大學生戀愛時代的「學費」，足足可以别外再供給一個無力升學中學生的大學「學費」的。不相信的人可以去調查，調查對了，可以貢獻政府，戀愛稅實有徵收之必要！</p>
<p>那班早有戀愛的人，只有在中學畢業時候結了婚，大學畢業方能進社會！</p>
<p>是落於正心修身齊家治國平天下之老生常談了麽？</p>
<h3>夏天的旅行</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>「海風，蟬鳴，六月的太陽。」</p>
<p>吳淞住的友人，來信說着這些誘人的宇眼，我們便開始了夏天第一次的旅行。</p>
<p>在堤上當風走着是愜意的，就是把一雙足醬泥灰寸積的村道中，也很愉快的，因爲人在但見屋瓦牆磚的環境裹面脫逃出來，便好像得了莫大的解放似的。</p>
<p>坐在一家賣汽水的茅草店内，望見了海面天空和田野，人便覺得是做了大自然的兒了，躺在牠的懹中一樣。海風作聲地吹着，依着籐椅就想呼呼地睡去，雖然我們的唇間，都在不時地流出使人不易倦怠的孩子氣那樣的話語。</p>
<p>籐桌旁邊的泥地上，嗙蟹悄悄地爬着，我們不去捉牠，也不作聲驚動，只是帶笑地看着，讓牠自由自在地。</p>
<p>到村中飯店去，路過蘆葦豐盛的池塘，便覺得在我們緩緩步去的足聲中，應該有二三隻野鴨，驀地驚飛起來。雖然結果是野鴨一隻也沒有，但却想起屠格𣵀夫在「獵人日記」上所寫的那些打野鴨的塲面來了。因此我們在日光下，信口開河的談話，便搭着了「獵人日記一這隻船，開到了小說的海洋上面。</p>
<h3>熱在南京（四）</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>至於各游藝塲，依然是擁擠滿座，生意並不因爲離奇的旱熱而稍减，人肉市塲，亦只是窮而卑下的人格外的倒霉，竟像野犬一般的成百的被捉到警局裹處罰。也或許因肉感的魅力在這夏季格外的强烈，令人覺得駭怕吧，所以市當局對各歌舞團之來京表演，忽然嚴令的禁止。其中有捲土重來的梅花歌舞團，因適逢其會，總算大觸霉頭了。不過同時又據報上說，這只是那老板方面稍吃一點虧，而女演員們並不感何寂寞呢。每到日暮，再看夫子廟前和太平路上的風光吧，在那紅紅綠綠的霓虹燈的閃耀下，熙熙攘攘的男女靑年們，各顯出來一種狐步挊的姿態來，眞比任何時候都衆多，都好看。尤其是那些無綫電的留聲機，放出沙沙的響聲，其間又雜以鳴鳴的汽車聲，得得的馬車聲，以及黃包車夫的么喝聲，肩挑小販的呌賣聲，沿途跪乞的求聲，···還有陣陣的隨風飄來的絲竹鑼鼓聲，與夫少女們的高唱低吟聲，由此合成一種都市上的交響樂，洋洋盈耳，無刻間斷，簡直如白晝蟬鳴是一樣的繁噪着。</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>那些到了明天還要照常勤勞的人們，都都早早的拖張席子到門外來露宿了。於是只看着男的，女的，老的，少的，滿眼都是些頭南脚北鼻息如雷的人們。他們爲着自私自利心所驅，往往會把人行道或窄街小巷堵滿了，也並不問人家好走路不好。但有爲着交通，並爲着衛生和觀瞻等的警察，便會常跑去干涉，不准擋道和赤膊，倘敢抗命，就請其到局了裹坐坐。但警察也很能體諒一般市民的辛苦，就是覺得他們的甜夢不可驚破了，遂令深夜肩賣食物的小商人，不准高呌或搖響。然而那些小商人，爲什麽又不深夜去睡眠，而偏出來鬧人呢？······</p>
<p>大槪窮人都是不怕熱的吧，所以這裹就無須有爲着窮人納凉的設備。南京的水還不像蘇州，每擔要賣到一元，因而他們儘可以到各慈善家沿街所設的茶缸前，喝上一個痛快。至於像東京每到夏天則於日比谷等公園裹，常設盛大的納凉大會以爲一般市民的享受，這殆是南京市民連夢中也想不到的事情了。</p>
<p>最後要說的是：窮人的命雖然不値錢，未足以邀大人先生的一顧，但以其約占百分之七十的在都市裹雜居，一量由於他們發生了什麽染病，而蔓延全市，則富貴之家豈眞能盡免？（完）</p>
<h3>我來自東（四）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>記者自去年九月間看過了百年進步展覽會，不見芝加哥已經半年了。這次再來到此地，半年前的惡影象，又跑進了我的心需來。任細雨濛濛的早上，汽車開進了這大城的南部；雖然許多店舖子與工廠還沒有開門，然而我可以聽見這充滿罪惡的都市，已經開始他嗡嗡之聲了。屠塲，流氓，機關槍，暗殺，綁票，賣淫，酗酒，敲詐，輪盤賭，貪污殘暴，種族間的仇恨，階級間的嫉視，這些一切，又在開始着牠們的一日一度的表演。</p>
<p>去年我住達爾登飯店，曾被芝加哥的電車鬧得幾天沒有睡好。現在我對於這些電車，還帶有憤怒。芝加哥的高軌電車，老是在行人的頭上駛過，有的時候，一個人的頭上，足畔，都有載滿乘客的電車，很吵很快的過去。電車軌道上，長滿了黃色的鐵銹，和道旁的煤烟薰黑了的幾十層的大建築物，配成一幅大都市的醜惡圖畫。</p>
<p>在密歇根大街的一角，高聳着兩座衝天的大樓，這邊是以賣口香糖而發大財的雷格來公司，那邊是每天销售八九十萬份的芝加哥講壇報的報館。這兩個公司的主人（雷格來已死），都是芝加哥最有勢力的富豪；而這兩座的建築物在芝加哥城的地位，也很像上海的先施和永安。</p>
<p>芝加哥一方面是富豪支配着的城市，但是大部分的芝加哥生活是操在流氓的手裹。妓女館，跳舞廳，賭窟，酒排間，夜俱樂部，以及許多下流的遊藝塲，都是流氓們開設。他們不僅自已來經營着製造社會病的生意，而且還來破壤社會的正當營業。差不多各種的芝加哥小本商工業者，對於流氓們每月要交一定的孝敬費，不然，他們便來燒你的屋，殺你的人，譬如洗衣服的舖子，理髮的舖子，按期有流氓來征收孝敬費。去年還出現一種流氓帮，專做打玻璃窗的勾當。如果你在芝加哥開舖子，如果你店裹面有幾塊大的玻璃窗，你每月便要向這一帮流氓納費，假使費沒有納到，在靑天白日下，他们便會來把你的玻璃窗捶得粉碎的。</p>
<p>芝加哥的流氓們，都備有炸彈，機關槍，以及許多最新式的殺人傢伙。往往在他們的總機闢裹，造有很完備的軍械庫。他們的領袖，往往有百萬千萬的家私。他們的組織，非常嚴密。他們的指揮，非常靈敏。從前他們所做生意，以賣私酒爲大宗。現在賣私酒的利潤，因酒禁開放，比較不大。所以他們的收入大宗，要靠綁票及打刦銀行等事。在芝加哥附近的幾個省份，過去一年中，不知多少生命財產，犧牲在這些流氓們的手裏。</p>

<h3>網球新術（十）</h3>
<p>Ｊ·ＰＡＲＭＬＹ　ＰＡＲＥＴ原著錢一勤洪均合譯｜版權所有不准轉載｜</p>
<p>若是來球在極遠的左邊、此時球員總是被逼而採用反手式、因爲此時還是要用正手式、球員就會被逼跑出界綫去、反是球在極遠的右邊時、反手式當然也就會使球員跑出界綫、並且球在極遠　的一邊的時候、球員若是定要勉强用正手式式反手式、他就會離開他固定的地位很遠、將球拍出以後、還要費力跑回來、預備應付下一次的局面、</p>
<p>球員一經决定選用正手式來拍擊、那麽拍擊時的種種方法和原則、就都應該仔細地講究、雙足和身軀的適當地位、和握拍的凖確方式、就是在前數章所討論過的、都要切實地熟諳和遵守、同不待言、至於球拍手臂和肩部的擺動、是拍擊時最重要的原動力、必要應用自如、絶不可稍受牽制、所以也就要詳細的研究和實地的練習、</p>
<p>正在來球將要落地以前、球拍就馬上要向後擺動、此種向後的擺動、是要直接地對着向前拍擊的擺動的、所以向前擺動要如保、向後擺動也要如何、若是要從平面橫擊來球Ｈｏｒｉｚｏｎｔａｌ　ＦｉＳｈｏｔ那麽球拍預先向後的擺動、就要和拍擊時向前的擺動一樣動一樣成水平綫、若是要從下方削劈擊、Ｕｎｄｅｒｃｕｔ　ｃｈｏｐ　Ｓｔｒｏｋｅ球拍就要高高地向後捉起、遠向外離開身軀、因爲此種拍擊、是向下向的擺動、所以將球拍出後球拍是底底的、</p>
<h3>校正</h3>
<p>第三章最後漏去全文一段如下、</p>
<p>所以發球時、不僅是要手法靈敏、落地凖確、還要更進一步、使球逹到對方的時候、接球者將受逼而失誤、方逄盡了發球的能事、通常發到對方的球、是故意要接球屠用反手還擊、雖然有的球藝精良的人對於反手或正手都沒有甚麽分别、於是要球落地時在接球者意料所不及的地位、若是接球者凖備正手還擊時、發球者就故意使球落在他的左邊、反是、則使球落在他的右邊、未發球以前、接球者凖備還擊的地位、是容易描凖的、所以發球者就要利用他這一種弱點、因而使他失誤、</p>
<p>通常用右手發球的球員、最好的地位是立在右、邊向左邊發球出去、因爲這樣可以將球發到全塲的中央區域、但是立在左邊塲地發球的時候、就很容易受接球者的極快地斜射還擊、而難於應付、所以在左邊發球時要將球發到塲地中央、接球者的右邊地位、這樣可以使他在塲地中央、免得受他的斜射還擊地危險、</p>
<p>發球時、要使盡順勢力、是要緊的、决不可將球拍出後、就馬上停止球拍的動量、這是足以减少拍擊的力量、並且影響到球落點時的方位、此種理由是和平常在塲内還擊來球時、要藉用順勢力一樣的、左手向上抛球的時候、整個的身軀、肩部和臂部、都要微向後仰着、然後忽然向前撲轉過來、於是全身的體重就自然地增加拍擊的力量、因而增加球飛的力量、</p>
<p>發球時、足部是極容易犯規的、所以要練成一種良好的習慣、使足部决不至跨過端線、在球實際尙未離開球拍以前、雙足都要在端線以後、足指觸着端線或是足在空中跨過端線、都是不可以的、此種地方、初學者應當要極端地留意、因爲足部犯規所受到的處罰、和球未拍過網、飛出界外、或不落在對方現球區内所受到的處罰、簡直是一樣的、所以在發球以前、必定要注意到你的足部、不使牠犯規、</p>

<h3>鄕村熱話</h3>
<p>— ·影·呆</p>
<p>今年，不知怎樣，熱浪捲到了人文薈萃的東南。小暑還沒有到，天已是這樣的熱，不久之前0，歐西的科學家，不是說今年無夏季嗎？但事實上却比往年的夏季更熱，而且熱得更早，使我們感到大自然的梳制一切，連科學也不能預測了。</p>
<p>這幾天在我們的鄕下，松江靑浦一帶，所有的農田，我們如查走去一看，已是一片堅硬的白泥，很小的稻顆，有的早已枯死了，有的橫倒在白的泥地上，一切的一切使我們感到旱災早已釀成了。</p>
<p>現在，田裹所需要的是水，但天已有幾十天不下雨，本來天不下雨可戽水，可是現在每處的河港，不者被火一般的火陽蒸乾，快見河底了，水車放在田岸上，知河水的平面、成了極度的傾斜，那能還戽得起水呢？每天是狂熱，每天是不下雨，農民除了眼看自已的田在裂縫，稻在枯死之外，委實沒有補救的辦法。</p>
<p>白天裹太熱，不能做工，等到晚上，候潮水來了戽水，有的人家有牛，有的人家沒有牛，便用人力去戽水，一夜的工作，戽得起一些倒也罷了，可是河底快要見底的時候，水委實是無法戽起。據說有一家有兩畝半的田，戽了一晚的水，到第二天，裹面一部分的地上，依然是白而堅硬，一些沒有水印，可知大旱之天，連戽水也不容易，可是人和牛，日夜的工作，都已疲乏得要受不住了，同時稻也在一天天的枯死。</p>
<p>不但是農民，一般的人，這樣的下去，也都要受不住了，河水的淺少，已因不流動而發臭，但鄕下的人們，所有的飲料就都靠河水，船隻已不能通行，交通早就斷絶了。米價在高漲，破產後的農村，早就沒有餘米出售，但糶米吃的人，却又要增加負擔了。在農材之中，一切的一切，都災苦的境象呢！天要再不下雨，委實要致農民於死地了！</p>
<h3>熱與夢想</h3>
<p>— 迪英</p>
<p>兩星期末，自拜領了這六十年來罕有的狂熱；而第六期航空獎得自已打碎了我的美夢。這幾日實在熱得自已在咒詛，還是死去的好。</p>
<p>可惡的蒼天，旣然賜下這殘酷的狂熱；第六期航空獎劵就該給我得一個頭獎，那末，縱使寒暑表上熱到沸點，我早已打下美滿的主意了！莫干山，廬山，靑島，以至北戴河，在那裹優哉游哉，都可渡過這悶熱的炎夏！</p>
<p>現在，夢是攪碎了，殘酷的狂熱却每日逼着寒暑表上升，一切的理想的享受談都不要談起，可是當汗流如水時，要想嘗一瓶水汽水而一摸雙袋那一股勇氣又沒有了！</p>
<p>阿！熱吧！狂熱吧！我自已在咒詛着還是死去的好！</p>
<h3>旱魃</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>黃梅天，該是請一陣雨一陣。記得在做孩子的時候，每逢黃梅天氣，嘴上便浮着一支小歌，呌做「日頭落雨，小鬼車水。」這用來描寫黃梅天也可說是極其盡緻了，同時我們也從而知道太陽下落雨，農夫尙不免要車水的。</p>
<p>但是這年頭，老天也變了，黃梅天豈但沒有啨一陣雨一陣，並且連一滴雨水都沒有。都市裹的人，自然不在乎，可是種田人那才眞急煞了。自種幾畝地，眼看着蒔下的秧棵，多麽匀，多麽齊整，靑蛙在田水裹躍動，小花蛇在游，一切都跟往年一樣，一樣的充滿着懽愉的希望，一樣的去勞作，往年收成不好總覺得自已工作不努力，今年自然特别要勤勞，所望於未來的京是年成成更好。</p>
<p>但是，汗流從焦赤的身上滲出來，日夜在水車上跑急路，水是不算得不多了，你瞧，河床都翻向天空了，而禾田裹的泥土並沒有潤混，雖裂着乾綁綁的圖案，秧棵垂下了頭，向他的主作着垂死的嘆息了。</p>
<p>於是，消息傳來，南京設壇祈雨了，小城裹斷了屠，猪仔的壽命延幾天，屋签上插了許許多多三角旗，寫着「上天王出巡，祈求甘霖」等字形，但是這種法了早便失了效騐了，不免蠢得可笑，但是隱伏在這可笑的事態後邊的是什麽呢？是哭是笑？是快樂是悲哀？這不用我說，讓事實來說。</p>
<p>拉雜寫了這些還相拖一條尾巴。科學昌明的今日，天旱天雨都不是沒有辦法補救的，可是南京也在四城求雨，難怪鄕曲更是要跪在太陽裹情願晒死了，但是雨水並不眞的這樣就會來。</p>
<h3>地獄裏的人們</h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>太陽像火球似的掛在頭上，四面是高的牆，厚的壁。街隅是一個垃圾箱，旁邊便是小便處：兩種混合而成的臭味，跟着蒼蠅在一陣的放射出來。風，自然沒有一個空隙可以飛進來；就是偶而有一些，也早已化了熱氣，何曾有什麽凉意？</p>
<p>地獄裹的人們：男的赤着膊，穿着犢鼻袴：就是不穿犢鼻褲，也把藍布褲捲得高高的，在破的板門上躺着。女的穿着夏布的背心，在搖着蒲扇。孩子不論男的或是女的，都是一絲不掛的在街上跳着，扭着，打着。大家在等　着太陽的西下，夜神的降臨。</p>
<p>到了晚上，日光雖然沒有了，凉風稍</p>
<p>爲有一些：可是老天對於地獄裹的人們，從不會待得好一些的；嗡嗡的蚊蟲，在你四週歌唱，你沒有法子使它離開。臭蟲那更可怕，每夜好幾次要起來拍蓆子；任你搬到街沿上去睡，它也會跟來，這又有什麽法子呢？</p>
<p>在地獄裹的人們，對於富人雖是也有相當的羡慕，可是對於他們一切的享受，未免有些矇𥋾；尤其對於這消夏的方�。電扇能够發出風來，確是怪事。什麽冷氣，那簡直是笑話，天老爺要熱，你怎麽能够使它冷呢？只有冰淇淋，却使他們永不反對：因爲這東西，只要化上二個銅子·就也能吃一杯啦！</p>
<p>地獄裹的人們，是相信命運的；他們不知道反抗。他們僅是每天每夜的過着這地獄的生活！</p>
<h3>都市夏夜</h3>
<p>— 唐增庚</p>
<p>夏夜，耐不住鴿棚的悶熱·窒氣，不得不在這微風送爽的街頭，作一下巡路的使者。雖然是發亮的柏油大道，但是街邊依舊是橫着一條條勞苦大衆們的肉體，忍受着夏神的虐待，只希望在這微有着淸風的夏夜，受到一些恩惠。</p>
<p>「猪玀，這是睡的地方嗎？起來！接着是鞭了抽了一聲「拍！」</p>
<p>是一個帝國主義者供養着的巡捕，扳起了神聖不可侵犯的面孔將一個裸了上身睡着的男人抽打。</p>
<p>「哦，先生，對不起，馬上走，馬上走。」從甜蜜的夢中被抽醒，摸着火辣的鞭痕，只有拖着身了走。</p>
<p>「他媽，你知道這是外國人的地方（？）嗎？」巡捕矜持的面龐，透露出十足的奴化。</p>
<p>馬路上較平日更多行人，都是那樣慢的，行在這夏夜的街頭，一個個在消磨着這凉爽的夜。</p>
<p>一處處坐着人，有的在高談闊論，有的在打情駡俏，還有的手中拉眘胡琴，直着嗓了哼京調，一切日間的苦熱，這時早已掉在腦後了。</p>
<p>「先生，唱一隻好嗎？」</p>
<p>「先生，無錫景，蘇州灘簧，十八摸······要唱一隻嗎？」</p>
<p>是母女兩個，黃黃的面頰，瘦瘦的身段，希望别人在納凉的夜間，唱一曲淸歌，但是，跑遍了街頭，喊遍了里弄，問過了無數的男人和女人，只有稀少的人們，是給了這可憐的母女倆一些生意，每夜，那凄凉的歌聲，蕩漾在這充滿着人的街頭，還不是賺得無量的悲量的悲哀罷了。</p>
<p>十二時以後的深夜，街頭依奮有着人跡，舞廳靡靡的音樂，跟那睡在地下的人們的鼾聲，奏着交響曲。</p>
<h3>風頭雨脚對話</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>風頭：「這幾天風頭由我出足，此地是沒有你的立脚點了。」</p>
<p>雨脚：「我是舉足識重輕的，所以金脚銀步，不肯輕易出行。前幾天偶然有興到過揚州，常州，江陰，等處，大受各地民衆歡迎，不像你的一味濫出風頭受人唾駡！」</p>
<p>風頭：「嘿！歡迎嗎？你到底此地沒有立脚點，所以走到粤，豫，鄂等省去翻江攪海，鬧出大大亂子。試問那邊民衆是不是也在歡迎你？」</p>
<p>雨頭：「你不要誤會啊！我是最近抱膝幽居，足不出户。恐怕我同類中的不良份了，大演其亦脚蘆花蕩吧。」</p>
<p>風頭：頓時發出狂暴的吼笑，似乎在熱嘲着雨脚施其掩惡掠美的故技呢！</p>
<h3>牛鞋</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>今年碰到絶舞僅有的乾黃梅，好久沒有下雨，天氣熱得打破六十年來的紀錄，河水乾得和前年的水災成了反比例。可是這時正當稻水吃緊的關頭，農家的老牛因爲河水涸淺，車水非常吃力，所以受了農人的鞭策，日夜不停的趕車，脚底大都走穿，蹣跚難行。但是不能因此而停止工作，農人於是急智陡生，特製皮革鞋給有脚病的牛着，仍令照常工作。雖然比較無脚病的牛遲慢一些，但着了鞋力疾從公，終究好得多哩。唉！今年的老牛可算得特别辛苦啊！</p>
<h3>熱浪襲滬—顧家宅公園速寫</h3>
<p>— 椀</p>
<p>一百零二度七，一百零四度四，熱度一天高似一天，柏油馬路也淌着汗，何况人，血肉之身軀，息禁得起這般熱烤。晚上，弄堂口，馬路邊，都睡滿了人，好像開人體展覽會，白天，弄堂口，或者可以坐坐，馬路邊，祇好暫爲缺席。另找稍爲空曠一點的地方，去透一口氣，所以這幾天，住在法租界的朋友，如潮似水般，都擠到頋家宅公園裹去。小子自然也是潮水裹面的一個泡沫，現在，把公園裹面的形形色色，速寫在下面：</p>
<p>祇要是園裹的一株樹，稍爲遮着一點太陽光，樹底下都坐滿了人，中間幾排法國梧桐樹，濃陰如蓋，那底下的人更多了，但是坐在那底下的，彷彿都是些堅定的顧客——，外國人家的奶媽，不是一般熱浪捲進去的朋友們能享得到的。</p>
<p>一位中國太太，坐在一張活動游椅上，搖着芭蕉扇，正瞧着旁邊後來的找不着椅子的人，顯出很得意很驕傲的神氮，迎而忽然來了一位熟人，剛站起來打招呼，猛不防，背後的案樂椅，像東三省似的，在不抵抗之下，被幾個外國頑皮的孩子，拖着跑了，祇好瞪着白眼望着他。</p>
<p>東邊池子邊上，自來水，龍頭，不斷的吐出淸水來。許多人，彎下身子，昻首頭，張大口去吸，天氣是太熱了。熱得喘不過氣來，　且解解渴，管他生水能吃不能吃。</p>
<p>冰凍荷蘭水、鮮桔水，用籐籃提着，走到你面前，問你要吃吧？紅的，黃的，白的，顏色是太好看了，可惜價錢貴一點，祇好望着它咽吐沫，但是銷路依然很旺，頃刻間，一籃子只剩下空瓶了。</p>
<p>一位羅宋太太，鋪了一床破爛的單被，睡在茅亭裹面長發上，混身顯出曲綫美，熱得直喘氣。旁邊有兩個孩子，在地下玩，身體髒得像猪玀。一　兒，羅宋太太醒了，打了一個呵欠，坐起來，打開身旁的破籐籃，裹面有黑的麵包黃的羅宋湯，和「沙士」一樣液體的食物，通通搬出來，一面喂孩子，一面自已吃，這大槪就是伊們的午餐吧？</p>
<p>中國的娘姨，帶着外國的孩子，成羣的坐在樹底下，每人的面前；一個針黹籃，一個盛着淸水的玻璃瓶，幾件小孩子玩的東西，還有一部一部的各式各樣的孩車，在陳列着，各人都在低着頭，打磕睡，拿着針黹不能做，天是太熱了啊！</p>
<p>池塘邊上，斜張着幾把小花傘，從每個傘的背後，看出去，都有兩對不同樣的脚，在並排陳列着，傘底下，大槪是一雙雙的情侶，在喁喁情話吧？所以用傘來遮着伊們和他們的面孔，不使旁人看見他們的肉麻相，這園了裹面的人，紙有伊們和他們，是不曉得熱的！</p>
<p>幾個頑皮的中國孩了，在花壇裹面翻筋斗，被戴尖頂帽子的巡捕看見了，嚇得飛跑，有一個年紀小一點跑不動的，被尖帽子巡捕抓住了，劈拍就是兩巴掌，中國小孩子不敢哭，這大槪是不抵抗主義的訓育成功吧？</p>
<p>一羣外國小孩子，在樹下玩泥沙，遇見中國人走過面前，冷不防，給你一把沙石子，幾乎連眼睛都迷住了，尖頂子的巡捕，站在眼前，昻着頭，在瞧那半天空的白雲。</p>
<p>太陽下去了！當中草地上，橫七堅八躺滿的都是人；也有三五成羣的，講着笑着，也有一對一雙的，在儇着倚着，也有孤零零地，在旁邊瞧着眼紅，氣不過，也哼着「桃花江是美人窩」「妹妹我愛你。」</p>

<h3>標紗再跌一元餘</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風又現、因棉市鬆動、而現紗銷路較前爲淸、因之人心軟弱、且本月份交割期限日近、交貨新紗已有二千包之說、但收貨人尙少、大槪仍係金融界套利者爲多、故買方心意雖濃、然環境未能十分樂觀、市價在二三元之間仲縮也、</p>

<h3>漢帮日有套賣棉花</h3>
<p>棉市仍挫、因連漲多日之美棉、今日反動而跌、致人心尤弱、新棉狀况愈見不振、因各方報吿皆有陣雨下需、棉田受惠頗深、故漢帮日有套賣、陳棉交貨仍湧、但有一部份由空翻多、不過市上實需益覺岺寂云、</p>

<h3>標粉出現驚人高價</h3>
<p>各月一致狂騰五分左右昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又呈狂騰之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一二角左右、坎拿大好四五角左右、至江浙内地、雖續見甘霖、人心方面、似稍安定、不過南中旱災甫蘇之際、北滿水災又吿接踵、是以業外人心理又爲之改變、此種不良景象、實予投機者增其助力也、當開價時、本月份即喊二角八分、後則遞升、迨至遠期開價、以業外多頭、紛紛收買、大連營口等帮、亦購買甚湧、因此市面飛黃騰逹、不可向邇、二盤以後、客帮又收買本月份、致遠期人心愈開愈激、如十一月份最高已至二元三角九分、十二月份至二元四角零二厘半、此種價格、已爲一二年來之最高新紀錄、後步如無政府之監督、限止物價、則民食前途、殊多殷憂也、結果本月份較漲四分半、八月份漲五分二厘半、九月份漲五分七厘半、十月份漲四分二厘半、十一月份漲四分七厘半、十二月份漲四分云、</p>
<h3>期麥重漲之主因</h3>
<p>洋麥續好···北滿鬧水空頭急補···交易大暢昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份均呈一致高漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處續好一二角至四五角左右、當開價時、以本外埠續得喜雨、人心未免轉定、故本月份開盤仍祇三元三角、惟此後則又狂抬、逐見嚴重、因北滿又吿水災、此後糧食之需要、或有向腹地採購之勢、是以空頭心慌、急遽抵補、行家之籌碼、亦多補回、兼以外行多頭、不出而返進、致市氣步提、交易亦大暢特暢、惟本月份因交割關係、補空尤盛、市價亦高昻益甚也、結果本月份較漲一角、八月份漲八分、九月份漲七分、十月份漲六分、十一月份漲五分、十二月份漲六分、現麥市面、亦見昻貴、因標凖狂提、客户心思、扳售無已、各檔亦喊高六七八分不等、開明光蔣家壩麥三元三角四分、蚌埠麥三元三角半、寳應泰州山東麥三元三角、管店麥三元三角二分、揚州瑤灣麥三元二角二分、大橋麥三元二角二三分、淸江麥三元三角、次二角八分、漢口麥三元一角、次二元九角、安慶麥三元一角二分、邊江麥二元九角、浦口麥三元一角八分、由福新去八千包、阜豐去五千包云、</p>

<h3>短波通信發逹之沿革</h3>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>欲述短波通信發逹之沿革，勢必須涉及整個無綫電之歷史，蓋短波之通信非能戰獨發逹，實由短波，中波長波三者反復逐漸發展以至於今日，然則在此簡短篇幅中欲叙述其整個歷史，實屬不可能，茲僅將其有關於短波通信者略述於後。</p>
<p>無綫電之實騐，始於一八八七年，距今僅三十餘年前，是時赫志氏始由實騐而證明電磁波之存在。赫志氏初發現之電波，其波長僅爲數米突之極短波，其特性宛如光波，具有反射，屈折，干涉等現象。至一九二四年更有學者作○，○○一秎米突之極超短波實騐而成功。但此等電波皆屬减幅電波，與今日所盛用之等幅電波大異其趣。</p>
<p>在短波初發現當時，因其發生方法之不便，收音裝置之不完全，且因所發生者皆係减幅電波之故，大空間，發射勢力立被吸收，不能逹遠距離。當時短波之不能發達，實因此故。</p>
<p>在馬可尼氏等初期實騐時期，發射裝置，利用自感量綫圈，大火花間隙放電，而使天綫電路振盪。由此極古典的方法所發生之波長，係由天綫之大小而决定，而天綫之大小又直接影響於通信距離，因此當時遂趨於大天綫之設置，而波長之運用因而亦逐漸限於長波。但因當時業餘研究家之利用火花式者激增，以致空間陷入極混亂狀態之中。</p>
<p>自一九○六年三極眞空管發明以後，等幅電波之發生甚易，且所用收音機之靈敏度漸優，於是一般業餘家竟捨火花式减幅電波之實騐，而羣趨於眞空管式等幅電波之檢討，逐漸進展，終於發現短波之驚異特性，雖用微少電力，亦能逹於遠距離，且不受空電之千擾，於是引起專家之注目，而更集中於短波之研究焉。此短波沿革之大槪也。</p>
<h3>短波的定義</h3>
<p>— 華萌</p>
<p>何謂短波，短波的波長苦干？這在各時代各有不同的界限。當短波未施諸實用以前，船舶通信所運用的三七五至六○○基羅週（八○○至六○○米突）波長帶·以至於廣播用之六○○至一五○○基羅週（五○○米突至二○○米突）之電波，均已稱曰短波。而以後週率更高之電波，漸被盛用，前此短波的區别，亦不得不加以戀更。</p>
<p>根據國際無綫電通信技術諮問委員會（Ｃ、Ｃ、Ｉ、Ｒ、）第一次在和蘭海牙開會所决定之電波分類如下：</p>
<p>名稱週率（每秒基羅週）波長（米突）長波１００以下三、０００以上中波戏１００至一、三００三、０００至二、００中短波一、五００至六、００二００至五０短波六、０００至三０、０００五０至一０超短波三０、０００以上一０以下</p>
<p>由分類可知今日之所謂短波者，係指自六、○○○至三○、○○○基羅週之範圍，卽自五○至一○米突之波長帶而言。</p>
<h3>短波特性上之優劣點</h3>
<p>— 華馨</p>
<p>近來短波無綫電之研究，盛極一時，其在無綫電通信界，大有取長波而代之之勢。且其應用範圍業已及於物理學，化學及醫學諸方面，其種種驚異的特性，更逐漸明瞭。</p>
<p>特性中之最足使吾人驚異的就是：以微少之電力，而能作數千基羅米突之遠距離通信。但小電力之使用，僅限於業餘之通信，商用通信則因種種原因，仍多傾向於大電力。</p>
<p>其次由實騐所得，凡週率愈高之電波，空電之妨害愈少，長波之收音，常遇空電之干擾，雖有種種屏除之法，然其効果甚微。然當雷雨之除，凡長波所不能接收者，短波則比較的易於接收。此亦短波優點之一。</p>
<p>又次在短波方面，易於舉行指向性之通信，以確保電力之經濟，以及通信之秘密。蓋電波之週率愈高，則其性質愈近於光波，而指向特性則愈銳敏。且天綫之設備可用小型，故其建設費自可低减。現在一般商用之短波局大抵採用指向式者居多。</p>
<p>最後最有興趣之事實卽由專門家之觀察，以爲將來之無綫電視，可利用超短波，極超短波以至於赤外綫，光波，堇外綫等，由指向方式而傳播於遠方云。</p>
<p>短波之優點，如上所述，但其劣點亦不爲少。</p>
<p>在短波之特性上，令人最感不滿者，有下述數種劣點。</p>
<p>（一）沉靜區域（Ｚｏｎｅ　ｏｉ　Ｓｉｌｅｎｃｅ）與跳躍距離（Ｓｋｉｐｐｅｄ　Ｄｉｓｔａｎｃｏ）：由實騐所得，短波發射至某相當距離之處，其收音强度極微，甚至無音訊可收，從引再經過相當距離之地點，則其收音强度又戀强勢，凡收音强度微弱或無音訊可收之地點，稱曰沈靜區域，而其收音强度復戀强勢之距離，稱曰跳躍距離，此種跳躍距離又隨波長晝夜，時日，季節之轉戀而變，其狀頗形複雜，然由理論上所得之跳躍距離與實測所得者大體相符，故此種現象已逐漸明瞭。</p>
<p>（二）衰落（Ｆａｄｉｎｇ）：在短波特性上，又有所謂衰落之現象，發生於發射電臺較遠之處，在　此所拉收之電訊，短時間内，忽强忽弱，是蓋由於天地波之相互干擾所致。此種衰落現象不僅限於短波，且中波以上之波長亦各具有，長波則無之，超短波亦無之。短波衰落之發生，在沉靜域以外數百基羅米突之地點爲尤基。其發生初無一定規則，妨害高速度通信，及無綫電話殊不淺也。</p>
<p>（三）反響：亦爲短波特有現象之一，當接收某電訊之後，又有同一電訊重復到來，宛如聲音之反響然。據專家之推想，此種現象似係由於同一電波經過不同之距離而逹至收音點所致。其甚者，足以干擾收音之進行云。</p>
<h3>短波之通逹距離</h3>
<p>— 靑釗</p>
<p>短波的特性中，最使我們滿意的，是用微少的電力而能作遠距離的通信。但他的行程怎樣？要知道這個，應先明白空間的機構。</p>
<p>根據專家的學說，謂大氣的上層有一種所謂「海氏層」（Ｈｅａｖｉｓｉｄｅ　ｌａｙｅｒ）的伊洪化層（Ｉｏｎｉｚｅｄ　ｌａｙｅｒ）存在着，這種海氏層是具有若干厚度，如第一圖所示在昼間和夜間，這種厚層及其距離地球上之高度是常起變動的。爲參考起見，第一圖中並插入極光出現的高度，流星之平均高度，地球收之最高峯，飛機及測定用氣球的最高記錄等，以示比較。</p>
<p>其次天綫之輻射特性普通可分爲低角輻射和高角輻軃兩種。這裹之所謂低角高角者，是指其對於大地之角度而言。第二圖所示者爲中波以上之波長的發射狀態，所用天綫係馬可尼式，圖中所示之矢的長短是表示輻射勢力的大小，其最大輻射幾乎和大地相平行，角度甚低，俗稱曰地波（Ｇｒｏｕｎｄ　ｗａｖｅ），其行程愈遠，電波被大地所吸收，其勢力愈弱。</p>
<p>但如第三圖所示，短波天綫之最大輻射却有相當的角度。再看第一圖（爲便利計；該圖畫成平面，但實際上，應畫成圓弧形），設由發射電台射出若干角度之電波，在畫間因海氏憎之高度較低，故所發射之電波只逹至Ａ點，在夜間因海氏層之高度甚高，故可反射逹至遠距離之Ｂ點。</p>
<p>第四圖表示電界之强度，圖中Ｔ爲發射電台，在Ｘ點附近之黑影爲地波之强度肛其强度之所及，僅限有於極近之距離，但在上層屈曲而逹至遠方的電波，則成如Ｚ所示之斜綫影形狀的電界强度，卽所謂跳躍距離。Ｙ點爲電波所不及之部分，卽所謂沈靜區域。因海氏層之高度時常動搖，欲定一跳躍距離，頗爲不易，因之欲以同一角度射出之電波，使以同一感度逹至同一地點，亦甚爲困難，且自然界的現象因年度，季節，時刻，氣候等的轉變，而有種種的變化，今日之專家卽努力於是項變化之檢討。預料不久的將來、短波無綫電或能有奇異的成效，亦未可呢。</p>
<h3>單管短波收音機試作</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>目下，一般業餘研究者的興趣，似乎又在轉向短波方面了，大有擅棄長波，專事研究短波的趨勢。降至最近，尤爲顯然。良以短波的妙處，在在引人入勝；優點的特多，亦爲被推崇的一大原因。且當此紊亂而惡劣的廣播收音環境</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>之下，玩廣播收音機的，似已感覺不到什麽興趣了，倒是裝一架短波收音機，收收電碼，聽聽音樂的來得新頴别緻，耐人尋味。不過裝置短波收音機，是頗不易易的。萬不能草草從事，而致遭失敗；需要細心校騐，庶幾成績優異。</p>
<p>如圖；是一張很完美的短波收音機綫路，是利用最新式複用三極五極眞空管６Ｆ７製成的。以其五極部份，作回授栅漏檢波，而以其三極部份，作一級變壓器連成音週率放大，所以其音量之洪大，得自天然，絶非如來復式的勉强所可比擬。倘製作時能稍加注意的話，是决不會發生困難的。並且牠的成績，一定較普通兩管機爲優，謂予不信，曷一試之。</p>
<p>此機各綫圈均繞於一寸四分之一直徑插入式膠管上，Ｌ用２２號漆包綫繞，Ｌ則用３０號繞。兩綫圈距離爲二分。Ｌ需間隙繞，惟其間隙之程度，需視綫圈之多少而定，總之，不論其綫多少，綫連間隙應佔一寸四分之三之長度。（如此則圈數少者，間隙必大，反之必小。）各圈應繞圈數列表如下：</p>
<p>波長（公尺）　Ｌ圈數　Ｌ圈數</p>
<p>１０－２０　　５　　　４</p>
<p>２０－４０　　１１　　８</p>
<p>４０－８０　　２３　　１５</p>
<p>８０－２００　５２　　２７</p>
<p>ＲＦＣ在此機中頗占重要，非僅鎭定回授力而已，抑且增加靈敏度不少。其誘導力不宜過大，約有４０ＭＨ者最爲適宜。</p>
<p>此機電源，甲電以用交流爲佳，已電無論乾電池，代已電，均可應用。代已電整流，用１７１半波整流已可。茲將各項零件列下，以作結束。</p>

<h3>音量失眞的補救</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>在業餘　　製的收音機·具有幾級　　　放在者　　　　　　　　　　（就是從揚聲器中放出來的音樂聲含糊不淸楚）考察這個弊端，多數係低週率變壓器品質不良，或放大比率過大的緣故，至於補救的方法極簡便，只要在第一級低週率變壓的初級（ＰＢ）間接一只拉放大級二十萬歐姆的變量耗阻器，再在（Ｐ）</p>
<p>和次級的（Ｇ）間接一只·○一朌法拉特固定電容器（見圖Ｒ呼Ｃ）這樣接好呌做耗阻器交連放大武，那末在音質方面可淸晰不少，再無失眞之弊，並且還可以兼用Ｒ來控制阐調的高低。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談抵制肉感影片</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>去年來中國的法國作家，在南京對歌女傾倒一時，到故都又對北平小姐顚狂不已，歲想與我國女子締結良緣的德哥派拉氏，近來在美利堅女人懹中又喃喃而語。説電影中熱烈接吻塲面應當多一點，在序曲時由牠可使人不懨倦，在劇中可使坐在椅子上沉沉欲睡的觀客興奮，在終曲時（彼名爲十一時四十五分的接吻），能够給歸家觀客靈魂上添上樂天情緖，使在汽車中的男女意想到彭克樂夫的臂中有一出神微笑的克萊拉實而接吻。這是電影所給的好處。</p>
<p>可是竟有不助美的人來進行取締肉感影片，實免有煞風景。紐約電云：「天主敎會與猶太加特立敎聨合，反對有傷風化的電影片，此種運動日漸擴大，加入廉恥聨合會者已有二百萬人。費城之杜格第主敎禁止天主敎徒進電影院，猶太加特力敎當局，舉行會議，準備抵制有傷風化之影片。電影業聞訊，大爲驚動，現已組織委員會，凡影片發行之前，須加檢查」云。</p>
<p>天下事眞可謂無獨有偶，一般人對於電影的好尙，有的認爲有傷風化，大加反對有的猶自喊内感塲面（接吻裸腿）須多一點，可以使男女陶醉。這究竟具有怎樣的義意呢？</p>
<p>我們看肉感影片之所以風行，是隨着社會不景氣的推進而發展。因爲那些腰間麥克的朋友們，自已已被擯在墳墓裹，爲求且樂今朝，就在電影的奶頭大腿間來找興奮刺激（自然旁的方法很多）；至於那些工銀勞動者和飢餓之羣，大部則因「大來」先生的不允許，差不多已把「安家立業」看成一種幻想，爲求一親芳澤，就祗好在銀幕上來博得兩小時的滿足。肉感影片之所以在這世紀末時發逹，有的人將看影戲當作日常功課，有的則「當當頭」以圖兩小時的享樂都是這一心理。幾乎可以說不景氣愈劇烈，影片就愈肉感，二者已成雙項的正比。</p>
<p>這種觀衆的心理，便造成影片製作者的「肉感」的投機；而且老實說，也造成明星竭力「野」「浪」的某種目的。前者的表現是生拉活扯的以明星出浴來作號召力，後者便希求以水銀燈下所犧牲的色相，來作某一時機的「花邊」洋房汽車的換取。凡此一切，被人看作可羡慕的事業，而也同樣是世紀末的反映。</p>
<p>因此我們可以說，電影之所以「肉感」「有傷風化」乃不得不已，因爲社會處處就是肉感有傷風化的社會。在這樣日趨沉淪的社會氛圍中，欲求電片之不，肉感不傷風化，就遠非天主敎加特力敎徒禁止進電影院，或以「廉恥聨合會」抵删之所能爲力。至於腦袋裹裝滿金鎊金元的電影業，組織委員會檢查，屬於掩耳盜鈴，用毫無疑問。</p>
<p>若問現時電影之不得不以肉感誘人，不用說我們中國惺眼朦朧跑進影戲院之老爺太太少爺小姐，他們對於「肉感」的興趣，而處於遣社會末期徬徨中的德可派拉，在在以女人肉感接吻來陶醉，就已表明它之所以「不脛而走」，和不得不沒落了。</p>
<h3>廢話連篇</h3>
<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>靑年人喜歡談愛，中年人喜歡談性。靑年人由談愛而要求性的關係，中年人由性的關係而要求愛的保障。（男女一樣，無分彼此。）</p>
<p>喜歡談愛的靑年人。他的戀愛觀，是至上主義，喜歡談性的中年人，他的戀愛觀，是義務主義。</p>
<p>初戀現時代人是誰都免不了要經騐一次，可是要再經騐第二次是沒有的事。</p>
<p>戀愛至上主義者是自已情願背了十字架，平凡的戀愛反而感覺到痛苦。戀愛義務主義者喜歡平凡的戀愛，如果碰到對方是戀愛至上主義者他就被迫上了十字架。</p>
<p>對於戀愛熱情的人，對於事業也熱情；可是，對於事業熱情的人，不一定對於戀愛亦熱情。</p>
<p>有熱情的人是容易被人工欺騙的人，沒有熱情的人，是常常呌人被他欺騙的人。</p>
<p>在戀愛中沒有想到義務的人，一想到義務他不戀愛了。</p>
<p>男子喜歡「結婚」前的戀愛，女人喜歡「結婚」後的戀愛。</p>
<p>誠實的妻子，丈夫欺騙她，誠實的太夫，也受了妻子的欺騙。</p>
<h3>談交友</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>除了最少數的例外。人，都有求偶的禀賦，不獨是求偶，而且有交友，合羣的渴求。這，我候大槪沒有人能否認吧。</p>
<p>宇宙的蒼茫，人生的落寞，單憑自已的「生的喜悅」，要想在人生道上弋獲多量的慰藉，自然是不可能的事。</p>
<p>所以我們必須追逐異性，追逐得後，更不憚煩瑣與痛苦，總得生兒育女，目的就在「團聚」。我們也必須去找尋同性或異性的朋友，頻相往還，通訊候好，朋友的喜悅，彷彿就是自已的喜悅，朋友的危難，也彷彿就是自已的危難，目的則在擴大生命的領域，雖不必無間朝夕的團聚。</p>
<p>這樣，人類的生，用得能充實，乃得能豐富，乃得能增色映彩。這樣，人類才眞正有生的喜悅，生之足戀，生之有意義。</p>
<p>反之，沒有朋友的親信的人，他必定只感覺得到人生的寂寞，宇宙的暗淡，社會的冷酷，原因就在生的喜悅之欠缺，不足以灌救他的心靈，他的生命自然狹窄了。我敢認定，這種人，無論他是怎樣的學博，無論他是怎樣的財富，也必是世間最痛苦的人。燕雀在窗前吱喳，跳躓；蟻螻在脚邊成行漫步，他不見了而感到異樣的難安？除非他是木石之徒，簡直沒有感官。</p>
<p>因此，很分曉的，我們要朋友，而且無妨</p>
<p>世間正不知有多多少少的人。因爲</p>

<p>生性的乘僻，以及沒有吸引他人的龍力，以致終的孤獨，落落寡歡，可是他們却不知運用天賦的聰慧，培養後天的能力，去追逐那濟濟的人羣。</p>
<p>那麽，我們怎樣的去交朋友呢？最好的方法，莫過於最忠誠的捧獻着自已的心，待别的關心别人，對别人的事情，表現着特别興趣，而這關心與興趣，又要出之於「自然」，否則别人會嗤你是做作，是虚僞。</p>
<p>其次呢，自已須要寛宏大量，世人是喜歡襟懹寛大的人。凡是「大量」的人，無往而不受人歡迎。</p>
<h3>廣州遊河之夜</h3>
<p>— 一軍</p>
<p>在白鵝潭畔，珠江河濱。我約同了三個朋友漫遊，逛長堤。</p>
<p>黃昏，從一百度以上的熱度已降至八十度了。在長堤，熱鬧的西濠口，車水馬龍的海珠前，萬人𢋵集的球江橋堍�··在那，在那裹的人大多數是「丢那媽」的土人，祇有我們四個是「他媽的」的「外江佬」參雜其間。</p>
<p>陣陣的凉風從珠江河面吹來，帶着「呌艇呀，遊河呀！」的蛋家妹淸脆的鶯聲。</p>
<h3>文凴與飯碗</h3>
<p>— 一　　　月亮上升了，倒影在江中，眞不愧當年文人雅士的讚美羊城八景之一的「珠江流夜月」啊！不過可惜「銅壼滴漏」已遭到了厄運而被拆缷了。不然我們還可以聽聽滴噹的漏聲。　　約莫是九點了。有一個空白短衣，行路扭動的蛋家妹跑來：「外江佬，遊河呀，睇老舉咩？」地說着。是的，我們給好引誘了，也許我們久有此心吧。於是我們就跟着她扭動的屁股下她的沙艇去了。　　沙艇，也許是廣州特有的吧，雖然沙艇的建造，與一般的划艇是大同小異的，可是它的内部佈置，確是超乎平常。祇有數尺寛大的艇艙裹，珠燈結綵，五光十色，陳設得異常華麗。可以做談笑鴻儒的客廳。並且我知道還可以作秘密舉動的所在。　　「外江佬，遊邊處呀，鬼棚尾，還是大沙頭？」搖着咿呀櫓聲的蛋家妹向我們問着，於是我們就决定遊大沙頭。　　江上的花街柳巷，這也是廣州特看的吧。在這。老舉艇陳列於江中。一排一列地，儼如街巷通衢。老舉成排成列地坐在艇前，任人飽嘗眼福。晤，她們不僅是陳列品，而且是出賣品，她們坐在艇前，閃着消魂的妖艷眼睛，是要招徠顧客的呀！紙有繳納納四元六毫的捐和五堪的身價就可以買她來一夜的擁抱，一夜的狂歡。　　我眞想呌個老舉來安慰安慰我這異鄕飄泊者枯燥的心情。但是我怕，怕傳染性病，而更怕的是染麻瘋。廣州一地麻瘋病還是流行哩，特别是蛋家妹老舉。所以廣州人常唱着有一曲歌謠：「該轉該轉！瘋蟲亂咁捐。買便舟，買便船···」這曲是麻瘋人警世的曲。　　已經是深夜了。心身確實舒服得多了。一切覊留我們身上的熱魔，都因爲了遊河而奔走去了。這是遊河所賜予的幸福。　　當我們要上岸底時候，蛋家妹妖媚的眼睛有所心事似的釘着我。並且婉轉的鶯喉懇留我們，過夜。隨卽向我耳邊低聲地說：「喺處過夜啦，有艇心呀，包你盞野！」　　「唔，你咪嚟咯！」我打着廣東話答她。於是我們四個人一步就離開那神秘的沙艇，跳上碼頭去。　　心身爽快，徐步徐步地跑回家去。還遠遠地卜卜卜的敲竹板聲呌賣魚生粥。這是够人愴傷的事呵！  文炳　　一早起，接着鵬的來信，我迅速的拆開來一看，呵，怎麽竟是這麽一個惡的消息？「呼日接到量儔的信，他說你的好朋友養吾已在××城病故了，要多迅速的轉吿給你」。　　養吾，是我平生所最敬愛的一個朋友！我想，假若是全人類中的每一個，都曾與他會面過，都曾與他深談過，通信過。那麽，每一個人都會對他起一種無限的敬愛，像我對他一樣。這，我有一種證信，就是在我的朋友中凡認識他的，沒有對他不表示敬愛的。　　本來，在現在的社會裹，所謂莫逆之交，所謂敬愛的好朋友，都逃不出」熱利關係」，「利用關係」，凡是有錢有勢的人，他的朋友無不對他敬愛，或者，雖然是無錢又無勢，但也彼此很敬愛，那就逃不了是互相利用，中間總不免有這麽兩種插污的綫索，彼此才能溝通友好。親愛的讀者，請試靜腦的想想，在這鬼混社會裹，有誰能逃出這個圈套？所謂忠誠而純潔的友誼在那見呢？然而我之所以敬愛着養吾，却很私幸的沒有被這插污的社會罩上上述的任何一種圈套。　　是兩年前的春天了吧，其時「滬戰」方休，冬霖給我一個信，說是介紹一個朋友給我，自然，那就是我現在在哀悼的亡友養吾，過了不久，我們就未見面，先通起信來了，到現在已經是很快的兩年多了。　　我們自通信以至認識，自認識以至現在，雖說爲時不久，但也有兩年多了。這當中，我們只有忠誠的純潔的虚構。的往還，沒有絲毫勢利，利用的虚構。　　循例，應是擺不脫一般的卑污，因爲在我們的結合上，是有着勢利的形式，是有着利用的機會。他，養吾是一政治上的活動者，而我却是一介塞酸不堪的文人。　　然而，我們眞的沒有過勢利的往來，利用的扮演。　　他曾在××城去過一次。但是他不曾呌我帮過他什麽必要的忙，我也不會因苦於飄流而想去依附他。其後在南京市我們又曾，過叙晤的時間，這是他是住在高樓大厦所謂頭等要人的公館裹了，但也一徑保持着我們的忠誠的純潔的友誼往還。　　然而我們却又確實的是非常的接近，非常之相得相契，我們會面時任性的縱談時事，品評人物，眞是忘形得失，一絲兒沒有隔閡。　　這樣的，一直到如今，養吾永訣了人間的如今，我敬愛着他，他是我平生所最敬愛的一個人，一個好友喲！　　他雖是政治舞臺上的人，却是那麽的熱情，慷慨，坦白，豪爽，沒有一絲兒的狡許，虚僞，陰險，奸細。　　也正因爲他是這麽一個人，所以、卑污的現社社。畢竟不能容納他，他十年的政治奮鬥，竟日見衰落·漸漸的沒有他的發展的可能了，他成了政治上的後臺人，不足輕重的死守在××城裹。　　也正因爲他是這麽一個人，所以他不自知珍重他的身體，打算他的前途。二年前已經醫生證明他是患着肺癆病，而他還不知休養，還是日夜不停的奔波，還是無間的沉醉在愛妻的懹裹。雖經我們忠直的勸吿，要他趁速從事休養，這在他，却是一個不聽。　　養吾，你的謝世，固正在我的意料之中。然而，我是多麽的爲你哀惋？你的偉大的人格，還不曾照透人間，你的偉大的事業，還不曾建立救世？怎不呌我哀悼喲！</p>

<h3>Will Confer in Changchun</h3>
<p>Yi Wo and Chai Shan Wait; Yin Tong and Tao Shangming Have Already Departed; Liu Lei and Yin [Ru Geng] Will Follow to Confer (Beiping) The war zone issue has not progressed due to Japan's ambiguous attitude.

<p>PingSui Railway</p>
<h3>Actively Repairing the Tracks</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The tracks between Fushengzhuang and Sandaoying on the PingSui Railway were repaired by Jin Tao, director of the PingSui Railway Engineering Department, with the supervision of 700 workers. The upstream train通 reached Zhuozishan on the 20th, and the downstream train 通 reached Bikeqi. There was heavy rain north of Pingdiquan on the 19th.

<p>(Beiping) Shen Chang談顧孟餘 is very concerned about the business of various railways in the North. After the summer retreat in Peiping ends, Shen will go to inspect each line or summon the responsible leaders of each line to Peiping to consult about everything. President of the South Manchuria Railway, 十河, visiting Peiping is a group tour, and is of little political significance. 顧 has not considered meeting him. The group can arrive at Peiping via Dalian tomorrow or the day after. The degree of damage done to the PingSui Railway last time due to floods was unprecedented in decades. After intensifying the repairs, the engineering car for the upstream train can reach Fushengzhuang, while the passenger car temporarily ends at Zhuozishan. The roadbed between Fushengzhuang and Sandaoying has been damaged for more than 200 zhang. Currently, more than 700 railway workers are actively engaged in local engineering.

<p>Serious Floods</p>
<h3>Harbin's Commerce Declines</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The western section of the China Eastern Railway, due to the flooding of Zhalantun, has submerged the tracks. The train terminates at Angangxi. The Boketu-Manzhouli section has opened additional trains for relief. Harbin's commerce is becoming more and more depressed. Japanese goods are being dumped as much as possible, causing the interruption of the transportation of European, Western, and Chinese goods. For example, Japanese canvas rubber sneakers are sold for 28 cents a pair. Although the value is so cheap, no one cares about it because the people are poor. All foreign merchants are 收莊收. The Qiulin 洋行 Department Store, a large White Russian merchant, owes a large amount of foreign debt and is unable to repay it. The creditor supervises the income every day, and all the daily business income is taken away. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In Harbin, on the 17th, because the water level of the Songhua River increased to 135.60 meters, the Daoli section, 街買賣街, and 透籠街 were all backflowing from the sewers, overflowing the streets. The depth can be two feet. Small boats re-entered the market for travel. The weather has been very cool in recent days, and there has been a lot of rain. It clears up for less than two or three hours every day, and then it rains again. Therefore, the general measurement predicts that even if the mountain floods upstream stop, Harbin may not be spared from the flood due to excessive rainfall. The eastern section of the China Eastern Railway has been running in two sections since the 16th, one from Harbin to Erсhengdianzi and the other from Hengdaohezi to Suifenhe. The middle section, because Yimianpo was destroyed by mountain floods, has cut off rail traffic. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The embankment of Chuanjiadian was partly destroyed by the water of the Songhua River. After two streets in Harbin were flooded, the repairs were completed today. However, the hearts of the people in Harbin are still panicked, and those who are evacuating are endless. Vehicles loaded with grain, goods, and furniture are running day and night on the road. Water pumps are operating non-stop. The situation is still very dangerous. The two embankments protecting the new bridge of the China Eastern Railway between Harbin and Lafa collapsed today and are currently being repaired. The water of the Songhua River is still gradually rising. Showers are frequent. It is heard that the water gushing from the ground has submerged the four suburbs of Chenhe and Nagarov加加 (both transliterations). Thousands of workers are now using sandbags to raise and repair the flood dikes along the Songhua River. (20th Reuters 电电)</p>
<h3>Puyi Will Evacuate From Flood</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yitong River has overflowed even more. The old commercial port area is located in a low-lying area. The water accumulates to a depth of eight or nine feet. The depth of the water outside the pseudo-emperor's palace, about half a li away, is two or three feet. The number of disaster victims is increasing, and people's hearts are panicked. The Japanese military department and the pseudo-state police department and gendarmerie have jointly formed a flood prevention association, implemented martial law, and stabilized prices. If the water rises another two feet, Puyi plans to move to Shenyang for temporary refuge. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Flood and Drought Disasters in Various Places</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Thousands of miles of red land, the gale is constant day and night, and the early and late rice are withered, yellowed, and damaged by insects. Linchuan and other counties have also reported drought disasters. The prices of rice and vegetables have soared. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Anqing) The temperature in Wan yesterday dropped on the 19th, the highest being 95 degrees Fahrenheit. There was a light rain for about an hour at 8 PM, and then it cleared up. The climate was quite cool at night, as if there was autumn. The temperature was also low on the 20th, and there was another light rain, with intermittent clearing. Still no help for agricultural affairs. The Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital and the Huaining County Government have jointly issued a notice, from the 19th to the 21st, intermittently banning slaughter for three days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Changsha) 54 counties in the province have been affected by water and drought disasters. The provincial party department telegraphed the Central Government requesting relief, and also requested the government to set up a grain management bureau to regulate the people's food. The provincial government decided to allocate 20,000 shi of grain first to handle the cheap grain sales in Southern Hunan. It telegraphed the Central Health Administration to distribute a large number of summer medicines to prevent epidemics among the construction workers at the Southern Hunan airport. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Arrived in Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan arrived in Peiping this morning to discuss. He went to Tianjin for medical treatment due to the recurrence of his back pain, and he has now recovered. He plans to stay in Peiping for two or three days to visit He and ask for instructions on everything. Then he will return to Zhangjiakou to inspect the flood. Many dams east of Zhangjiakou have been destroyed by the floods, and the water has not receded yet. The disaster situation is quite serious. After I return to Zhang, I will work with the Construction Department to plan relief measures. The area east of Chahar is peaceful. The puppet troops in Guyuan Longmen, etc., have withdrawn to Duolun. Kurihara Tadashi, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, arrived in Peiping this afternoon to handle official business and will return to Tianjin in a day or two. After traffic on the PingSui Railway was hindered by the floods, Jin Tao is supervising the rush repairs between Fushengzhuang and Sandaoying. It is expected to resume traffic by the end of this month. Earthwork is currently being built. The upstream passenger train still reaches Zhuozishan, the engineering train between Zhuozishan and Fushengzhuang, and the downstream train only通 reaches Bikeqi. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Arrived in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Peiping tonight to discuss. The War Zone Relief Committee will conclude its meeting tomorrow. Because Chairman Huang is not in Peiping, I am here in Peiping as the Deputy Chairman of the Relief Committee to represent and attend to discuss the conclusion of the matters. Unfinished matters of agricultural relief will be taken over by the future Rural Enterprise Cooperation Committee. The Hebei Provincial Government will continue to handle the work relief. Although the water levels of the rivers in Hebei Province have risen, it is hoped that problems will not occur due to effective precautions.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Maintains Measures</h3>
<p>Trend of Issuing Public Bonds (Nanjing) The debts of Shen Xin Yarn Factory and Maoxin Flour Factory have been investigated and found to be more than 20 million yuan, and the three months of taxes owed by the Unified Tax Administration are not included. According to sources from the competent authority, the method of maintaining each factory has been discussed repeatedly. If each factory resumes operation, the total budget must be 10 million yuan. Due to various reasons, it is difficult for the banking industry to establish a loan. The only hope is that the Ministry of Finance will allocate funds for relief, but because the amount is too large, the Ministry of Finance cannot allocate this cash immediately. Therefore, the current trend is that the Ministry of Finance will issue public bonds with a face value of 10 million yuan, and the competent authority will supervise, and in the future, the Ministry of Finance will be repaid in installments with business profits.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The US Air Force Squadron's Flight Along the Pacific</h3>
<p>Last year, Italian former Minister of Aviation, Balbo, led a squadron on a long journey to the American continent. The world was shaken. British and American military experts believe that Balbo's success has opened a new world in military science. The military value of squadron flight is limitless. Recently, twelve aircraft of the US Army and Navy have made a flight along the Pacific coast. Ten Army bombers have already departed from Washington today, and their target is the islands near the Alaskan Peninsula. The military and political significance of this matter is noteworthy.</p>
<p>It is well known that the ideal enemy in the US defense plan is Japan. The distance from the US to Japan is long, and the military situation between them has been studied in detail by both sides. If the US goes to war with Japan, it can take three routes. First, the US Navy advances along the South Pacific waterway. Second, it passes through the Caroline Islands in the Central Pacific, which are under Japanese mandate. Third, it goes along the North Pacific coast of Alaska. The US has the weakest facilities along the first route. Although the US has Samoa as its territory, most of the islands belong to the UK, Australia, or Ceylon. US warships rely heavily on stopover points and oil stations along the way, and it is most dangerous to take this route.</p>
<p>The second route, from San Francisco to Hawaii, is completely under the control of US naval power. There is no doubt about that. However, from Hawaii to the Philippines or Shanghai, there are many small islands. Those emerging from the sea include the so-called South Pacific Islands, which Japan was entrusted with administering by the League of Nations after the Great War. Japan has spared no effort in building defenses on all these islands, and their natural terrain is suitable for building airfields and artillery positions. Although the League of Nations covenant stipulates that military projects are not allowed to be built here, according to investigations, Japan has brazenly done so. It is difficult for the US fleet to pass through this small island zone across the Central Pacific if it wants to advance westward. A few months ago, US naval aircraft flew directly from San Francisco to Hawaii and completed the task as planned. The Japanese side has already become concerned. However, this only belongs to the Eastern Pacific region, which Japan has long considered not to be an area it wants to interfere with.</p>
<p>The third route has recently attracted the attention of military strategists. This route goes along the coast from Seattle to Alaska, through the Bering Sea, and reaches the Japanese-owned Kuril Islands, as well as Hokkaido and Honshu. This route is the shortest, and the opportunity for cooperation between the navy and air force is also the greatest. Three years ago, Captain Lindbergh's flight from the US to Asia followed this route, and at that time, the Japanese people denounced it, believing that Lindbergh's visit had a military purpose. Japan has been paying attention to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands near it for a long time. Fishing boats and yachts that visit here often have the mission of reconnaissance and surveying. The US has also recently planned to build large-scale airfields on the islands. Since the points of attention of the US and Japan are concentrated here, the military mission and role of the twelve US military aircraft flying here from San Diego this time cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is that military calculations often involve political issues. The most interesting issue before us is the position of Canada in this flight route. Those who understand know that there is the Canadian Dominion between the US mainland and its territory of Alaska. Now that US aircraft are heading north, they must pass through Canadian airspace. Moreover, according to the plan this time, aircraft will set up stations along the way, and the territory of Canada will inevitably have US military aircraft stationed there. Canada is a dominion of the UK. However, although it belongs to the UK politically, it is already part of the US economically and geographically. If the US and Japan have an incident, Canada's neutrality cannot be maintained, and the coercion of the British Empire will be even more difficult.</p>
<p>Tonybee is a modern British international scholar. He pointed out at the previous Pan-Pacific Academic Conference that Canada is the most dangerous area. His intention was that once a war breaks out between the US and Japan, Canada will inevitably be drawn into the vortex, and the British Columbia area will be the first to see airplanes and bombs. Now that US aircraft are flying to Alaska and are passing through Canada, if Canada maintains neutrality in the future war, it will definitely not allow US aircraft to invade its airspace. Otherwise, Japan will point out that Canada is not fulfilling its obligations as a neutral country and will treat it as a belligerent country. Allowing Canada to protect its领最高法院Judgment</p>

<p>Japan's Far East Policy</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Publishes Article Attacking It</h3>
<p>The Monroe Doctrine of America and Asia Differs in Nature, Japan's Desire for Aggression is Just Emerging, China Will Never Yield to Force (New York) Chinese Minister to the United States Shi Zhaoji published an article in the North American Review today, strongly attacking Japan's Far East policy. Shi warned the world that Japan intends to occupy more land in the Asian continent and is now waiting for the right opportunity to fulfill its desire. Shi strongly criticized Japan's so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine, believing that Japan's Asian policy is very different from President Monroe's doctrine, because the United States' Monroe Doctrine is entirely defensive in nature, while Japan's only aim is to expand its territory. Therefore, Japan uses force every time it demands commercial preferential treatment. Moreover, Japan's political organization, the army and navy in the cabinet are all held by active-duty military personnel who are directly subordinate to the Emperor and lack the spirit of democracy, so Japan's army and navy policies are often dangerous for international peace. As for China's determination to resist the enemy, Shi also solemnly stated, "China will never yield to force, so as to give up an inch of land and its independence rights, and will do its best to resist," and so on. Shi is currently in London for his son's wedding and will return to the United States soon. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>The Okada Cabinet of Japan</p>
<h3>Announcement of Ten Major Policies</h3>
<p>Foreign policy will follow that of the previous cabinet, and national defense will prioritize security and internal affairs, emphasizing discipline and supporting rural areas. (Tokyo) The regular cabinet meeting held this afternoon continued, deciding on a draft of major policies. The meeting adjourned at 2:45 PM. The content of these major policies is divided into the following ten sections:</p>
<p>(1) Constitutionalism, (2) Ideological Countermeasures, (3) Diplomacy, (4) Strengthening National Defense, (5) Establishing Finances, (6) Stabilizing National Life, (7) Industrial Policy, (8) Improving Education, (9) Manchurian Issues, (10) Unifying Administrative Agencies. (20th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet's major policies were decided upon at the cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 20th. An immediate request was made for approval, and the full text was announced at 5:30 PM, as follows: "I have been honored with the mandate to form a cabinet, and I am deeply concerned about my inadequacy. However, with my humble talent and strength, I will devote my sincere efforts to enhancing the happiness of the people internally and promoting international justice externally, striving to fulfill the sacred mission. As our country is currently facing difficult times, we must establish fair and just policies in the future to implement them effectively. I hereby declare the outline of my administration and hope for your joint cooperation to make up for my shortcomings. I will now elaborate on the following:"</p>
<p>(1) The seriousness and impartiality of politics are essential for ensuring the trust of the people in national affairs. We will purify the political arena and strictly enforce official regulations. At the same time, we will vigorously reform various corrupt practices in central and local administration, promote a sense of urgency, and strive to fully realize the true essence of constitutionalism to facilitate the expression of public sentiment.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the revitalization of the national spirit and the purification of national thought, having received the imperial decree, we must clarify the concept of the national polity and cultivate the foundation of the national spirit. Furthermore, we must eliminate various causes that lead to unstable thoughts.</p>
<p>(3) Striving for the establishment of international peace and contributing to the well-being of humanity is our country's firm and unwavering national policy. The government should further enhance friendship with various countries. In the current political situation, in order to fulfill our mission, we must ensure that nothing is overlooked. (4) National defense is an essential requirement for the existence of the nation. We should observe the international situation and strengthen our defenses in response to the demands of the times. Regarding the upcoming Naval Arms Limitation Conference, we should prioritize ensuring national defense and security and adopt a fair and appropriate approach to strive for its realization. (5) In times of internal and external challenges, consolidating the financial foundation is of utmost importance. However, in an abnormal environment, restoring the financial foundation to normalcy will undoubtedly be difficult. We must strive to enhance national strength as much as possible to restore a balance in accounting revenue and expenditure. The best measures should be taken to establish a solid financial foundation.</p>
<p>(6) Striving to stabilize the lives of the people is an urgent task. Considering the recent complex economic situation and the special trends in the international economy, the government believes that it is necessary to expand its planning and implementation of various measures. Therefore, the government will strive to improve the lives of the people, especially by working to revitalize the rural economy, thereby enhancing the welfare of the working masses. We should also give the best consideration to this matter. (7) Regarding the prosperity of industry, we must also pay attention to developing resources and expanding trade to increase national income. We believe that these are all essential tasks. Due to the complexity of industrial facilities, we must carefully consider coordination and control to adapt to domestic and international economic conditions, in order to establish a comprehensive industrial policy that encompasses the entire national economy.</p>
<p>(8) Cultivating the Japanese spirit, nurturing national character, and paying attention to improving national physical education to stimulate the intellect that is suitable for the times are important for promoting the progress of culture and education. Therefore, we should carefully consider both the education system and actual conditions.</p>
<p>(9) The amity between Japan and "Manchukuo" is considered a landmark and solid foundation for establishing peace in East Asia. The government should assist in the sound development of the Manchurian Empire. At the same time, based on the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, we should strive for the greatest possible effect in all aspects based on the friendship between the two countries.</p>
<p>(10) In order to achieve fairness and agility in administration, what is done must be necessary for the nation and desired by the people. In order to suit the agility and vitality of the times, we believe that it is necessary to carefully consider the structure and function of administration. The government should conduct a thorough review of the entire administrative structure to identify areas for improvement. (20th Jiji News Agency) (Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet's policies and programs clearly state the guidelines of the current cabinet. The main points are as follows: (1) To conduct fair and just politics in accordance with the Constitution, with particular emphasis on upholding discipline. (2) The recent international situation is extremely complex and has subtle trends. The Empire is mindful of world peace and believes that for the sake of maintaining peace in the Far East, it will not hesitate to provide full assistance to the sound development of "Manchukuo" as a neighboring country. (3) Therefore, the current cabinet will follow the fundamental policies of the previous cabinet regarding the implementation of independent and peaceful diplomacy and the establishment of its policy towards Manchuria, in order to be thorough. At the same time, it will also respect the decisions of the previous cabinet regarding the coordination of diplomacy, national defense, and finance. (4) The Empire is currently facing an international difficult situation with the revision of the naval treaty imminent. However, with regard to national defense, especially the strengthening of national defense capabilities that are absolutely necessary for maintaining peace in the Far East, we must strive to gain the understanding of both domestic and foreign parties. (5) Special attention will be paid to the stability of the people's lives, and efforts will be made to implement various policies to revitalize the economy, in order to thoroughly achieve self-reliance. (6) To seek reform in the political arena, in order to establish a fair and just system. (20th Denstu Telegram)</p>
<p>Saito visits the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy</p>
<h3>Navy will not change established policies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Hiroshi Saito, visited Minister of the Army, Hayashi, at the Ministry of the Army residence at 3:40 PM today to report on the American attitude towards Japan, with particular emphasis on diplomatic policies towards Manchuria and East Asia. He also inquired about the fundamental attitude of the Army. After a forty-minute confidential talk, he departed. (20th China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Navy, Osumi, met with Ambassador Saito yesterday to listen to the results of a detailed briefing on the situation in the United States. He became even more convinced of the Navy's established policies and will continue to strongly advocate for the original plan to Prime Minister Okada and other related cabinet members, urging them to support and move towards the realization of this policy.

<p>Sun Ke vacations in Honolulu</p>
<h3>Preparing to meet Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(Honolulu) Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, stated today that he hopes to meet with President Roosevelt to discuss Sino-American issues. Mr. Sun did not disclose which issues he intends to discuss with Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt will soon arrive here aboard the Houston, but this trip is purely for vacation purposes, so it is unknown whether he will agree to discuss diplomatic issues with Mr. Sun. Even an informal conversation is doubtful. (19th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Tan Zhen travels through Europe</p>
<h3>Studying the judicial system</h3>
<p>(London) Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan of the Chinese National Government, told a reporter from the North China Daily News today that his trip to Europe and the United Kingdom aims to study European prisons and judicial systems. He spent six weeks in France, studying French criminal law and observing court trials. French criminal law is commendable, but it is too cumbersome and too focused on academic theory. The judicial system of the new era in China is based on the European system, and now it should be modified with what is practiced in the United Kingdom. Mr. Tan plans to stay in England for three weeks, visiting Lord Sankey, a British and French judge, and visiting various courts. He also hopes to meet with British Foreign Secretary Simon. Mr. Tan praised the British system of selecting experienced lawyers to serve as judges, saying it is better than the European system. Mr. Tan acknowledged that the appointment of Chinese judges has some improprieties, but efforts are currently being made to improve their status and ensure their positions are protected. He also said that the Shanghai Special District Court was created in an unfavorable environment, and difficulties are inevitable. He hopes that when a new agreement for the court is established in 1936, various countries will agree to abolish consular jurisdiction. After leaving the United Kingdom, Mr. Tan will also travel to Germany, Italy, the United States, and other countries to conduct investigations, and he expects to return to China in November.

<p>Ten U.S. Army airplanes</p>
<h3>Fly to Alaska</h3>
<p>Aviation Survey Report Released</p>
<p>(Washington) Ten Army bombers departed from here today and flew to Alaska. This flight has attracted much attention because Army aviators repeatedly had accidents while transporting airmail last time. The flight team will stop briefly in the Dalton area to refuel before flying on to Minneapolis. (19th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) The special committee investigating aviation, chaired by Mr. Batte, submitted its report to the Secretary of the Army this morning. The committee believes that the Army and Navy air forces should remain separate and not be merged. The report stated that according to the investigation, the strength of the U.S. Air Force is not weaker than that of any country, and this result is due to the separation of the Army and Navy air forces, which can be considered a good system. Modifications should be made, but not recklessly. However, the report believes that the number of fighter planes is insufficient and advocates for increasing their production while reducing the number of combat and reconnaissance aircraft. The report believes that although the total number of U.S. aircraft is not small, the number of combat aircraft is slightly less than that of Japan and equal to that of the United Kingdom. As for the order of air forces in various countries, the Soviet Union ranks first, followed by France, the United States, then Japan and the United Kingdom ranked fifth and sixth.

<h3>U.S. bans death ray machine</h3>
<p>An Omaha death ray engine that can turn blood into water and kill birds hundreds of feet away has been banned by the U.S. government because it could destroy humanity. Burns, chairman of the National Inventors Congress, claimed at the conference that the machine was invented by Dr. Longula, a physicist and electrical engineer. Last October, he personally witnessed the death ray machine in action. At that time, the government also sent several scientists to the scene. The machine's body was quite similar to a movie projector. Dr. Long exposed cats, rabbits, and other animals to the death ray, and all died instantly, their blood turning into clear water. When the ray was directed at birds, they fell from the sky upon being exposed. (19th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japan's Major Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>With American Planes as Hypothetical Enemies, 350,000 Participants (Tokyo) The Tokyo Garrison Headquarters conducted an air defense drill in the Kanto area last August, but the results were not good. Therefore, it has been decided to hold another drill this year, and several preparatory meetings have been held since the 14th. It is reported that the plan has been finalized, and the drill will begin at 3:00 PM on September 1st and end at 2:00 PM on the following day. The participating cities are Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama. The hypothetical enemy is American planes flying from the Pacific to attack. It has been decided that the participating ground forces will include the Garrison Headquarters, the 1st Division, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Youth Corps, totaling 350,000 people. The number of participating aircraft has not been determined. (20th China United Press)</p>
<h3>Paris Conducts Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>(Paris) French scientists estimate that the noise of the city streets and vehicles in Paris is not very accurate, so the siren warning of an enemy bomber attack could not be heard throughout the city after it was tested today. The French government immediately ordered another test. (19th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Britain Expands Air Force</p>
<h3>Labour Party Impeaches Government</h3>
<p>Believes in Encouraging Military Arms Race (London) Opposition Labour Party members of Parliament have filed an impeachment motion against the government's plan to expand the air force. The House of Commons will present a discussion on July 30th. The content of the Labour Party's impeachment motion is that while international talks are underway to seek the conclusion of an arms reduction convention, and the European non-aggression and mutual assistance convention is being drafted, it is incomprehensible why the British government is adopting a rearmament policy at this time. According to the new convention plan, Britain has no need for this. This rearmament policy hinders the hope of international disarmament and does not contribute to national security. It merely encourages a dangerous arms race, preparing the world for war. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Acting Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council, Baldwin, made a statement to the House of Commons tonight, saying that Britain first reduced its armaments to the lowest level that endangered itself, originally intending to promote a trend and set an example for various countries. However, the arms reduction conference has been unproductive for many years, causing concern in all sectors of British society. The current policy of the British government is still to reduce armaments and not abandon the hope of partial realization of arms reduction. However, it is by no means believed that any results can be obtained in the near future. Baldwin then explained the British air force policy. This statement was long desired by the Conservative Party. Baldwin said that Britain will increase its air force strength by 41 squadrons in the next five years, 33 of which will be used for defending the mainland, and the remaining eight will be used for the navy and for defending the empire. However, this is only a plan, and there may be changes in its implementation, because the arms reduction conference may make progress on the one hand, and the national financial situation must also be taken into account. (19th Havas Telegram) (Paris) The Daily Reporter Saint Pu Litu discusses the British government's air force expansion plan, saying that "Britain has exhausted its efforts to organize an air force. Britain's air force has fallen to sixth place in the world. France has 3,000 military aircraft, the United States has 2,660, Japan has 2,100, the Soviet Union has 1,700, Italy has 1,640, and Britain has only 1,500. The difference between British civilian aircraft and those of various countries is still small. For example, France has 1,650 civilian aircraft, Russia has 1,500, Italy has 1,500, Japan has 1,385, and Britain has 910. The difference is not as great as that of military aircraft. Now, the only effective way to defend the country is to repel the enemy with lightning speed when foreign invaders attack. The British must recognize this. Therefore, we only regard Britain's expansion of the air force as a victory for peace and not as a contradiction with the aspirations of peace." (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Polish Warship Visits Russia</h3>
<p>Warsaw officials announced today that two Polish destroyers, led by Rear Admiral Ong Leka, will officially visit Leningrad for several days on July 24. After arriving in Leningrad, Admiral Ong Leka will also lead a special delegation to Moscow to hold meetings with Soviet military authorities. (19th Kuo Min News Agency) MacDonald stated</p>
<h3>Britain will not hold a general election</h3>
<p>British and Canadian Prime Ministers met for an hour. British Prime Minister MacDonald and his daughter arrived in Quebec, Canada, today from England. Before leaving for Nova Scotia, he met with Canadian Prime Minister Bennett for an hour. The British Prime Minister told people that the rumors that Britain will hold a general election soon are unfounded. The British Prime Minister spends a lot of time reading official documents every day, which has greatly damaged his eyesight and caused his eye disease to recur. He plans to stay in Canada for seven weeks. During the vacation, the British Prime Minister's duties will be taken over by Power Wynn. All important domestic developments will of course be notified to MacDonald at any time, but MacDonald will try his best to avoid using his eyesight as much as possible. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy and Austria will hold a meeting</h3>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here indicate that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Chancellor Dolfuss will meet in Lisina on July 27, but will not discuss important political issues. (20th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>Shooting of British Officer Case</p>
<h3>British-Turkish friendly resolution</h3>
<p>It is recognized that the Turkish sentry opened fire without malicious intent. A memorial service will be held at the scene of the incident. HMS Thanet Lieutenant Robinson and two others were sailing on a sailboat to the Greek island of Samos when a Turkish sentry on the opposite land shot at them, killing Lieutenant Robinson. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now issued a statement stating that neither party had any malicious intentions. The Turkish sentry mistakenly believed that the three people in the sailboat were smugglers, causing the disaster. The British and Turkish governments have now reached a friendly decision to hold a memorial service for the deceased officer at the scene of the incident. A Turkish warship will participate in the memorial service, and then this unfortunate event can be considered over. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Thai Dio attacks Hsu Dan</p>
<h3>Destroys Political Party Truce</h3>
<p>Fear of a Major Cabinet Shake-up (Paris) The dispute between Thai Dio and Hsu Dan over the Stavisky financial scandal threatens to cause a major cabinet shake-up. Some people are now blaming Thai Dio for breaking the political party truce. The cabinet meeting this afternoon intends to try to mediate the matter. It is believed that the cabinet will announce that Thai Dio's criticism of Hsu Dan is purely a private matter and not an official matter, and will abide by the decision of the Stavisky case investigation committee, which is that Hsu Dan's respect is beyond question. Thai Dio may resign in anger, otherwise the Radical Party's cabinet members may submit their resignations. Prime Minister Du Mae Ge is currently resting at his hometown and is unable to come to Beijing due to exhaustion. However, he will remotely listen to today's cabinet meeting and has installed a machine in his residence to participate in the discussion. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet has decided to meet today to discuss the conflict between Minister without Portfolio Thai Dio and his colleague Hsu Dan before the Stavisky financial scandal investigation committee. Thai Dio spoke before the committee, accusing Hsu Dan of handling the Stavisky case hastily when he was prime minister, and said that Hsu Dan was the first to know about the 1932 case. The question today is whether the six Radical Party cabinet members can stay in the cabinet with Thai Dio. Prime Minister Du Mae Ge did not agree to cancel his leave and return to Beijing, which implies that he hopes to reconcile the dispute. However, there is one thing that must be considered today: if a cabinet shake-up occurs today, the parliament will be dissolved, and the Radical Party may inevitably suffer setbacks in the future general election.

<h3>Taiwan Storm and Rainstorm</h3>
<p>Taipei Southern Taiwan and the east coast have been hit by a hurricane since the 17th, coupled with heavy rain. It gradually calmed down on the night of the 18th, and since the 19th, there has been another storm. The water volume of rivers throughout the island has surged. The damage to rural areas in southern ports has reached more than one million yuan. Seventy meters of the railway bridge between Pingtung and Chaozhou was washed away, and the railway between Taipei and Yilan was also destroyed in several places by water. Penghu Island also had strong winds and rain. The number of deaths and injuries to people and animals is very small. The storm is expected to subside by midday tomorrow. (20th China United Press)</p>
<h3>Poland's Devastating Flood</h3>
<p>Warsaw Poland's southern flood is extraordinarily heavy, the worst in over a hundred years. Prime Minister Koslovsky returned to Beijing today after inspecting the Vistula River area. It is said that this flood will leave more than 50,000 households displaced, with an estimated 250,000 men, women, and children. Tens of thousands of homes have been partially or completely destroyed by water. Residents of many towns and villages have moved to evacuate, and the situation is dire. The authorities have organized a special committee to handle disaster relief in the affected areas and are currently rushing food and medicine using various means of transportation to meet urgent needs.

<p>Government Oppresses Public Opinion and Sanctions</p>
<h3>San Francisco General Strike Ends</h3>
<p>Various industries resume work, the National Guard has not been withdrawn, and the transportation industry dispute will be forcibly submitted to medium arbitration</p>
<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>The General Strike Committee here has voted to end the general strike, and the leaders of the Oakland labor union have also agreed to have the 42,000 strikers resume work. All transportation businesses in Alameda County have begun to return to normal. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee passed a resolution stating that the current conflict endangers the entire society, leads to the failure of civil rule, and instead promotes the promulgation of martial law. This is a necessary matter to avoid with powerful force. The resolution also accepted the recommendations made yesterday by the arbitration committee appointed by President Roosevelt, recognizing that they can serve as a basis for direct negotiations with employers. It is worth noting that Secretary of Labor Perkins declared in Washington yesterday that the arbitration committee's suggestion that labor and management should immediately cease hostilities should be regarded as mandatory for both employers and workers. She believes that it is not necessary to force employers to accept arbitration, but it is the duty of every citizen to cooperate with government agencies. The arbitration committee appointed by the president made arbitration recommendations, which is like a fire brigade telling you to prepare water quickly for irrigation and rescue when a large fire spreads. You naturally cannot but obey the order with respect. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>The San Francisco general strike ended today and the lively area quickly returned to normal. The strike in the East Port area will also end tomorrow morning. During the general strike, a total of eight people died on the Pacific coast. In San Francisco alone, 297 people were seriously injured, 638 were arrested, and property losses were around 150 million. Governor Merlin announced today to the striking workers that the Director of the National Recovery Administration, Johnson, withdrew the National Guard, but has not yet received a formal application, so it is difficult to withdraw the troops before it is confirmed that there will be no more disturbances. About 40,000 union workers in the East Port area will begin to resume work tomorrow morning. Strike Committee Chairman Catwell announced that the arbitration committee appointed by the president has agreed to fully consider the disputes between the sailors and the shipping company, and the shipping company has also agreed to abide by the arbitration. The Strike Committee then decided to announce the resumption of work. After the resolution to resume work was passed, labor unions in various places immediately sent workers to resume work. The theater workers resumed work within minutes, and the musicians will resume work at 3:00 PM. With the end of the general strike, the sailors and dockworkers became isolated. It is said that this is a tragic defeat for the workers in recent years. It is difficult to say this afternoon whether the tough sailors union will follow the resolution to resume work. (19th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>The General Strike Committee today, with a vote of 191 to 174, passed a motion to advise workers to cease striking. Sympathetic strikes will be the first to resume work. The committee will use its financial and spiritual capabilities to promote the end of the longshoremen's strike. It is generally expected that the longshoremen's strike will officially come to a close soon. The committee issued a public statement saying that the National Longshoremen's Mediation Board appointed by President Roosevelt has undertaken to give full consideration to the maritime employees' unions in its arbitration. Several thousand strikers have already returned to work today. The situation in San Francisco seems to be gradually returning to normal. Municipal streetcars are now operating as usual, without the need for military or police protection. Streetcars carried a total of 300,000 passengers in the past 24 hours, a record unheard of in a single day. The food blockade has now been lifted, and trucks loaded with supplies are arriving in the strike areas one after another. Although there is no one to protect them, they have not encountered any disturbances. The strikers' momentum has waned, which can be seen from the fact that general businesses are gradually recovering today. The Mayor of San Francisco has declared his determination to expel communist agitators. Many shops are open, and food and gasoline are readily available without difficulty. Under pressure from the central, state, and local governments, the San Francisco general strike has shown signs of total collapse in the past 48 hours, so the General Strike Committee's decision to stop the strike was expected. This afternoon, the police searched communist organizations, resulting in the arrest of several people, including a university student. The General Strike Committee also passed a motion today, requesting the state government to withdraw troops from cities along the Pacific coast for the sake of peace and goodwill. The committee also decided not to dissolve itself, pending President Roosevelt's decision. It is generally believed that the end of this strike is due to the power of public opinion, as the general public is unwilling to submit to the authority of the unions. Labor leaders, seeing the public's resentment and the decline of labor power, had no choice but to bring it to an end. The residents of San Francisco are very pleased to hear this good news.

<p>Ceylon Restricts Japanese Goods</p>
<h3>Cabinet Resolution Opposes</h3>
<p>But the Governor Has the Power to Overrule</p>
<h3>Colombo</h3>
<p>The Ceylon Cabinet decided today to reject the implementation of a quota system to restrict the import of Japanese goods, because if this system is implemented, the cost of clothing for the poor will increase. The Cabinet informed the Governor of Ceylon that if the British Colonial Secretary, Mr. Lyttelton, insists on implementing a quota, he must take responsibility for enacting the legislation using his powers. According to a Reuters report from London, the Ceylon Cabinet's unwillingness to implement a quota did not surprise London political circles, as recent indications had foreshadowed this development. What action the British government will take is difficult to predict at this time, but Reuters has learned that the Governor of Ceylon may exercise his power to implement quotas if necessary.

<h3>The Downfall of Hitler's Close Friend</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After Mr. Strasser, a former important leader of the National Socialist Party, was killed during the June 30th purge, officials today finally handed over his ashes to Strasser's wife for collection, but the gold ring and other items that Strasser was wearing when he was killed were not returned. The gold watch that Hitler had given to Strasser's children in the name of a godfather has now been returned by Strasser's children. It is known that Strasser was a close friend of Hitler during his lifetime and worked hard as Strasser's campaign manager. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler has left Berlin and gone to Sangcheng, and will soon go to the Berghof villa for a summer vacation. Other government officials will also leave the capital for summer vacation in the coming days. The government officials' vacation will last until the National Socialist Party holds a conference in Nuremberg in early September. Before September, the government will not hold meetings to discuss legislative issues. In the eyes of the National Socialist Party authorities, all kinds of problems that have recently arisen domestically have been completely resolved after the June 30th coup. The internal situation of the cabinet is still chaotic. Although Vice Chancellor Papen nominally remains in his original position, no one knows what task he will undertake. Minister of Economic Affairs Schmitt is on leave due to illness, and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels is preparing for the propaganda campaign that will begin in the winter. Minister of Defense Blomberg recently issued various orders, striving to closely integrate the relationship between the military and the National Socialist regime, but some say that Blomberg's policies have not been fully agreed upon by all military officers. In short, all of Germany is tired after the events of June 30th, so at least during the vacation, domestic issues may be temporarily put to rest. (Havas, 19th) German Government</p>
<h3>Bans the Sale of Sinclair's Books</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The authorities today ordered a ban on the sale of the works of the famous American writer, Sinclair. All those on the market must be confiscated by the government. Sinclair is a sociologist who gained considerable fame after writing the Civil War novel "Manassas." Later, he turned his attention to the arbitrariness of capitalists. The publication of his book "The Jungle" in 1906 made him famous worldwide. The book thoroughly exposed the deplorable conditions of the Chicago stockyards' meatpacking plants. The factory owners were furious. Former President Roosevelt ordered an investigation into the truth, and found that much of what was written was factual. As a result, Congress passed the first National Pure Food Law. In 1913, Sinclair investigated the abuses of the Colorado coal mines and wrote the book "King Coal," which was published in 1917. Congress again passed laws concerning coal mines because of this. Sinclair deeply knew that most of the bad habits in the United States were supported by the power of money, so he wrote several novels to highlight the sufferings of the people. His book "The Profits of Religion" severely criticized the collusion between religion and capitalism. The book "The Brass Check," published in 1919, proved the alliance between big businesses and American newspapers. "The Goose-Step," published in 1923, exposed how wealthy people donated to universities in order to influence students' political and economic beliefs, because university students are the future leaders of the country. The book "Money Writes" shows that Sinclair firmly believes that the power of capitalism is enough to sway the production of national literary works. The recent book "Boston," with its vivid writing style, also depicts the terrifying power of capitalist evil. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Okada Cabinet's Military Preparations (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Strengthening Military Strength, Abandoning the Central Role of Official Agencies, Promoting Young Officers, Emphasizing Unit Service</p>
<p>The Okada Cabinet is an extension of the Saito Cabinet and should inherit Saito's previous policies. However, this Okada Cabinet emphasizes so-called talentism, implements bureaucracy, selects experts in administrative affairs, and only superficially appeases political parties. For example, the Seiyukai, with a large majority of 300 seats, was only allocated three cabinet seats, which shows the rise of so-called expert forces (in reality, the rise of bureaucratic and military forces). On the other hand, it reflects the decline of political party forces. Now, the Seiyukai is eager to take the opportunity to restore its old political power, so it resolutely expelled the three members who participated in the cabinet formation, Takejiro Tokonami, Tatsunosuke Yamazaki, and Nobuya Uchida, from the party. Within the Seiyukai, it seems that this has reduced its internal contradictions and there is a great appearance of resurgence. However, it has two major weaknesses. First, the Japanese people have long been deeply disgusted with the hardships of the urban masses by the established political parties and cursed them to die quickly, so naturally they will not help it now. The rural people are also very tired of political parties, so in any case, the Seiyukai will not get the support of the majority. Second, the zaibatsu are the foundation of the party, but now they have turned to surrender to the military, which fundamentally does not want political party politics. Therefore, it has lost its backing and dares not stand up straight for a fair political struggle, only shouting a little.</p>
<p>As for the military, that is very different. At the beginning of the Okada Cabinet's formation, there was a clear understanding that the new cabinet would recognize its so-called national policy. In the naval aspect, it is to expand the navy to cope with the naval reduction conference. In the army aspect, it is to strengthen national defense to cope with emergency events. Regarding the navy, it will be discussed later. Now, I will first report on the army's so-called national defense enhancement. The first thing to do is to prepare to increase the number of regular army divisions. In addition to the four divisions stationed in the three northeastern provinces in fact, adding four reserve divisions, it also plans to increase the regular troops of four divisions. Secondly, it is to completely place the political economy of Manchuria under the management of the Kwantung Army Commander under the guise of the economic alliance. The traditional habit of the Japanese army is to emphasize centralization, so if those who become officers have the care of bureaucratic families or the friendship of nobles and aristocrats, then the time they directly lead troops is very short. Therefore, direct troop commanders below the brigade commander often never encounter it in their lifetime, and their promotion is very slow. Especially since there have been no wars for many years, there is no way to establish military merit. Even if they have talent, there is no way to express it. Therefore, many young soldiers are not very willing to lead troops, but are willing to serve in central agencies such as the General Staff Headquarters, the Inspectorate General of Military Education, and the Ministry of the Army, where they have the opportunity to express themselves. At the same time, their academic qualifications and the order of their rankings during their school days are also the main conditions for promotion. However, after the September 18th Incident, there have been slight changes in fact. The expeditionary army has special opportunities, and its position has become very important. In addition, the current active preparation for war will further arouse the ambition of the general young officers. If it continues to adhere to bureaucracy as before, then there will be little guarantee of victory in the future war.</p>
<p>After several consultations among the three chiefs of the army (Chief of the General Staff, Inspector General of Military Education, and Minister of the Army), it was believed that in order to prepare for an emergency period, in addition to active military preparation, special personnel renewal was also needed to inspire the courage of young officers and compete with their hypothetical enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to sweep away the current stagnant atmosphere at the top (in reality, to replace it with a purely pro-war faction, and an actively pro-war faction), so weeding out is implemented. During the regular mobilization this autumn, a large number of senior officers will be replaced. As for the backbone officers, the young soldiers from major to colonel, are the most powerful, most active, and most aggressive people in the current Japanese military. They are powerful implementers in the central government and the organizational hub in the troops. Therefore, it is now decided to break the previous relationship of academic qualifications and shift the focus to the troops. In the future, majors and lieutenant colonels must serve in the troops for more than one year, and regimental commanders (colonels) must serve for more than two years, so that active officers are familiar with the situation of the troops and can be responsible for the command of actual warfare. From this, it can be clearly seen how active the Japanese military is in preparing for war. (Tokyo, July 14th)</p>
<p>The Sichuan Bandits</p>
<h3>In Layer Upon Layer of Encirclement</h3>
<p>=The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Route Armies are Advancing Fiercely Towards Wanyuan, Bandit Troops are Collapsing Internally, Only Killing is Used to Awe the Public=</p>
<p>Chengdu Airmail News, The Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army has been making very rapid progress since the start of the second phase of the fourth-period general offensive on the 11th of this month. The situation of bandit suppression according to reports received by the headquarters on the 15th is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation of the Five Routes Attacking Wanyuan</h3>
<p>Tang Shizun reported the battle situation of the various divisions and brigades of the five routes, saying: "(1) Yang Qiwen's brigade began a feigned attack on the evening of the 14th. The next morning, the bandits came to counterattack. After a fierce attack by Shi Tuan of the brigade, the bandits retreated to their original positions. Roughly, the right wing is progressing, and the Zhou and Wang brigades can advance to Huangzhongbao to form a pincer attack. (2) Liu Guangyu's brigade, Liu Yuying's brigade, and Yang Tuan attacked Xuanzu Temple. At dawn, they broke through two layers of bandit fortifications. Fighting until 10:00 a.m., the bandits reinforced with a regiment and fired fiercely from high ground. The officers and soldiers fought bravely. At noon, the bandits were unable to hold on due to excessive casualties and retreated. Our army then constructed fortifications at Guwenping in front of Tiegongya. (3) Peng Huanzhang's brigade and He Tuan attacked Kongjiashan top and the vicinity of Daping. After a fierce attack for half a day, in the afternoon, they occupied Tuya zi and Tongliangpo. The Fourth and Ninth Brigades, from Miatiaopu, Dagouzhai, and Yechengbao. The Eighth Brigade took care of the wings of the Second and Ninth Brigades.</p>
<p>, still guarding the original line. (4) On the morning of the 14th, Rao Brigade led the Deng, Wang, and Liu units to attack Chaoyang Temple from Lao junshan, and the Sanchun unit advanced to Ranjia Ba. Wang Tuan temporarily stationed a part of its force at Lao junshan to support both sides. (5) Division Commander Xu Shaozong personally led the special teams and flat-firing gun company to Baiyang Temple. The Seventh Brigade was ordered to proceed to Shitangba via Changba Chang. The Ninth Brigade had already arrived at Shitangba and was ordered to move to Baisha River. The Eighth Brigade had occupied the line of Longjiao Mountain in front of Shuanghekou and was cooperating with various units to attack Wanyuan. Wang's unit was still blocking at Mingtong. Ma's unit is currently stationed at Gujunba."</p>
<h3>Li, Yang, and Pan Encircle Wangping</h3>
<p>Li Jiayu of the Third Route Army telegraphed the province on the 14th, saying: "After I finished inspecting the front, I agreed with the two chief commanders Yang and Pan on the deployment for the joint attack, and launched a full-line night attack on the night of the 9th. Chen Brigade of my department, from the line of Mianyanfen and Dousuozi, attacked the rear village of Wangping. Li Brigade attacked the line of Yinglongshan, Heiwozi, and Tianhuashan, and used a part to flank from Zhoujialiang. The bandits relied on the solidity of their fortifications and the danger of the terrain to resist stubbornly. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, repeatedly charging and capturing three layers of the main bandit fortifications in the rear village of Wangping, killing a large number of bandits. Later, at noon on the 10th, the bandits used a large part of their forces to reinforce and counterattack from Yinglongshan, pouncing on our Zhoujialiang line. I swept them with machine guns, killing about four or five hundred bandits. Taking advantage of the situation, Chen Brigade again occupied four layers of the main bandit fortifications in the rear village of Wangping. Li Brigade occupied Houbazhai, Luoquan Yan, and the area at the foot of Yinglongshan. At night, I ordered Huaijiang to attack. Fighting until the beginning of the 11th, our army had attacked into the rear village of Wangping for a long time, fighting a bloody melee, advancing and retreating more than ten times. There are many fortifications in the bandit village, and each wall is equipped with hand-held grenades and automatic firearms. It is also high and solid, so if we destroy one layer, they can still support each other and resist desperately, causing many casualties to us. Five or sixty people died or were injured in one minute, which is the only time my department has suffered such casualties since suppressing bandits. The stalemate lasted until late, with many bandit reinforcements. We are still in a state of encirclement and fierce fighting. The Yang and Pan units on our right wing are also fighting fiercely and have made progress. As of now, my department has suffered 300 casualties and dozens of guns. The bandits have suffered more than 1,000 casualties. Our army's ammunition consumption is very high. In addition to ordering to encourage a fierce attack and to blast the tunnel fortifications, I hereby report."</p>
<h3>Bandits Use Multiple Killings to Stop Escape</h3>
<p>According to the report of Li Lu Wang Brigade of Tian Department of the Second Route Army, "When our department was fighting near Heba, a squad leader of the bandit party, surnamed Qi (from Hubei), surrendered with several new-style guns. According to Qi, the bandits are surrounded by various armies, and both ammunition and food are lacking, showing a tendency to collapse. The internal morale of the army is extremely scattered. Currently, the only thing the bandit army is using to suppress the people's hearts is killing. Each regiment of the bandit party has a regiment political office, with about six or seven thousand people under its jurisdiction, all carrying new-style weapons. Their authority is to supervise the battalion and company commanders and to command directly. When fighting, they implement a joint responsibility system. If the company commander retreats, the entire company is killed. If the battalion commander retreats, the entire battalion is killed, so the bandit army dares not retreat when facing the enemy. Also, the soldiers and lower-level cadres of the bandit party are not allowed to have cash. If hundreds of copper coins are found, they are executed. Lower-level bandit officials, from company commander down, are not completely clothed. They are not allowed to eat their fill for two meals a day. However, senior bandit officials and pseudo-political workers can wear silk and eat meat, and have several lovers for venting their animal desires. Also, there is a so-called girl comfort team in the bandit army, which is ordered to go to the comfort objects (euphemism for intercourse) when the bandit soldiers return victorious, to be used for entertainment. If it is peacetime, it is absolutely not allowed. The morale of the bandit army is scattered, and they are always thinking of escaping to make a living, but because the surveillance is very tight, it is difficult to escape, but there are still those who escape privately at any time."</p>
<p>Central Relief Committee</p>
<h3>Investigates the Disaster Situation in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Passes Drought Prevention and Disaster Relief Measures, Emergency Relief is Provided First to the Most Severely Affected Counties</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, The floods and droughts in this province are extremely severe. The rivers are overflowing, and life and property are being lost to the floodwaters. The rain is delayed, and the fertile land is turning red. Now that the river water has not risen, the dike is being repaired. Drought relief and famine preparation are the most urgent tasks. The provincial government held a meeting to discuss drought prevention and disaster relief, and passed four measures: (1) The Relief Committee will quickly raise relief funds. (2) The Finance Department will quickly discuss with the Farmers Bank and rural financial relief institutions to release loans for relief as much as possible. (3) The Civil Affairs Department will strictly set the performance evaluation of the county heads in handling famine administration in various counties, and the reward methods for local organizations and people for disaster relief. (4) Regarding the fundamental drought prevention and famine preparation measures, the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments will jointly formulate a plan and submit it for discussion. Emergency relief will be provided first to the counties most severely affected by the disaster. Two hundred thousand yuan in cash are being borrowed from the banking community and two hundred thousand yuan in public bonds are being persuaded to be sold by the Chamber of Commerce in order to be distributed. In counties with dikes, work will be used instead of relief. The Central Relief Committee believes that the disaster area in Hubei Province is vast and the people are suffering, and relief should be coordinated. On the 19th, a telegram was sent to the Civil Affairs Department, requesting that the degree of suffering and the names of the counties be telegraphed within a few days, and that a detailed report on the disaster be submitted for transfer to apply for funds for relief.

<h3>He Jian Passes Through Hankou and Returns to Hunan</h3>
<p>Talks in Hankou Clarify Misunderstandings Between All Parties</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Army for the Suppression of Bandits in Five Provinces, previously received an order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to fly from Hunan to Guangdong to discuss the second phase of the plan to encircle and suppress the remaining bandits with the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi. After meeting with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi in Guangzhou, he went to Hong Kong to visit Hu Hanmin, and made more efforts to communicate opinions between the central and local governments. He went to Nanjing to report and then climbed Mount Lu again to visit Chiang Kai-shek, and met with Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, and Xu Yuanquan to discuss joint defense measures in Hunan and Hubei. On the 18th, He led his entourage Ling Zhang and Zhang Peiqian down the mountain to Xun, and took the Ningshao wheel westward. He arrived in Hankou at around 7:00 a.m. on the 19th and took a special train on the Wu-Chang Road back to Hunan at 6:00 p.m. that evening. He Jian made a speech in Hankou, saying, "I was ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go south this time to discuss the suppression of bandits with the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi. The five-province bandit suppression conference was held in Guangzhou, and senior generals Chen, Li, and Bai attended. They all believed that the national crisis was serious, and internal stability was necessary before external resistance. Therefore, the suppression of the remaining bandits was a prerequisite. Therefore, the result of the meeting was very satisfactory. The armies of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei cooperated unanimously. The Guangdong army has strictly defended all key points and has sent heavy troops to assist in the suppression. A division of the Guangxi army has also been dispatched. The southern route has been equipped, and the east, west, and north routes have been contacted earlier. The future of bandit suppression is very optimistic. The Red bandits have completely collapsed internally and only occupy five counties in Jiangxi. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek plans to completely suppress them before November this year. In the past, the north and the south were separated, and rumors of various kinds occurred. After I went to Guangdong and met with Chen, Li, and Bai, all misunderstandings were cleared up, and the generals expressed that they would only follow the orders of the central government from now on. When I passed through Hong Kong, I visited Mr. Hu Zhan Tang and had a chat. Hu does have plans to go abroad, and it may become a reality in the future. I had a good impression of the negotiations in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The Fifth Plenary Session is scheduled to be held in November, which will be a good opportunity to eliminate the bandits and unite the country to resist foreign aggression. I reported the trip to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang in Nanjing. I also visited Chiang Kai-shek several times on Mount Lu to ask for instructions and discussed bandit suppression in the border area between Hunan and Hubei with Deputy Commander Zhang Hanqing, Director He Xuezhu, and Commander-in-Chief Xu Kecheng. The Bandit Suppression Conference was not held, and because I have been away from Hunan for more than a month and military and political affairs are urgently waiting to be dealt with, I must return to Hunan today and will not go elsewhere."

<p>Changsha Wounded Soldiers</p>
<h3>Causing Trouble and Destroying the Police Station</h3>
<p>The Incident Originated from a Wounded Soldier, Chen Chunsheng, Walking on the Wrong Side of the Road, and was Executed by Firing Squad. Changsha Correspondence: Since Hunan Implemented the New Life Movement, there have been good phenomena in society. However, the police still lack training, causing disputes whenever they interfere. In the past two months, conflicts have repeatedly arisen between the police, the military, and the people due to interference with violations of the New Life Regulations. At 7:00 AM on the 16th of this month, Jiao Zhenhua, a cook from the Hunan Disabled Soldiers Training Institute, was carrying a load of vegetables and passed by Tanggong Temple. The patrol officer, Zuo Qingyun, advised him to walk on the left side. Jiao refused, leading to a conflict. Zuo blew his whistle and summoned several policemen, who arrested Jiao and took him to the Outer East Precinct for detention, awaiting disposition. Unexpectedly, over 700 wounded soldiers resided in the institute. Upon hearing this news, they were greatly indignant. Led by the wounded soldier Lei Weichen, they gathered two to three hundred soldiers and rushed to the Outer East Precinct. With a shout to attack, they swarmed in. First, they destroyed the telephones, then seized the constables' swords, hacking at everything they saw and beating everyone they encountered. In addition to completely destroying all the belongings in the precinct, they also beat and injured the precinct officers Zhang Ying, Patrol Inspector Hu Wenbin, Hu Desheng, Sergeant Wei Shirong, Constables Zuo Qingyun, Xu Zhong, Yuan Jun, Tan Xinzhen, Liu Zeren, Li Yuankai, Chen Shaoshu, He Shurong, and twelve others. Precinct Chief Deng Dugong escaped by climbing over the wall from the backyard, fortunately avoiding being beaten. By the time the Garrison Command and Public Security Bureau dispatched reinforcements, they only managed to capture one wounded soldier, Chen Chunsheng, who was caught on the scene robbing weapons and committing violence. The others had already rescued the cook Jiao Zhenhua and returned to the institute with shouts. As a result, the police officers of the Outer East Precinct dared not stand guard and requested protection from the Public Security Bureau. Hu Da, Commander of the Provincial Capital Garrison, and Zhou Han, Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, ordered Yan Baochu, Director of the Disabled Soldiers Training Institute, to hand over the principal offenders and prevent the wounded soldiers from committing further atrocities. Director Yan apologized to the Public Security Bureau, and in addition to the institute being responsible for all medical expenses for the injured policemen and compensation for the damaged belongings, the cook Jiao Zhenhua and the wounded soldier Chen Chunsheng, who initiated the incident, were handed over to the Outer East Precinct and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. The wounded soldier Lei Weichen, the wounded soldier Liao Heming, Xing Kui, Wan Guoqing, Wang Baotian, Xiao Shichu, and others who incited the riot were sent to the Fourth Route Headquarters for punishment. Zhou Han then submitted a report to the Security Command for approval and had Chen Chunsheng executed by firing squad yesterday morning as a deterrent and to enable the New Life Movement to be implemented. The Public Security Bureau's announcement of Chen Chunsheng's crimes is recorded as follows: "Regarding the announcement of the crimes, according to the report from the Outer East Police Precinct (omitted)... and delivered the two suspects, Jiao Zhenhua and Chen Chunsheng, to the bureau. Upon interrogation, the perpetrator Jiao Zhenhua confessed, 'I am 36 years old, from Xiangyin, and work as a cook at the training institute. This morning, while passing Tanggong Temple, I disobeyed the police's instructions and assaulted the officer, resulting in my arrest. Then, many wounded soldiers came and a conflict occurred.' Chen Chunsheng confessed, 'I am 29 years old, from Chaling, and was wounded and hospitalized in the 19th year of the Republic [1930]. Today, while I was having breakfast at the institute, I suddenly heard that the cook had been arrested, and everyone shouted for rescue. I arrived late, and some people were already fighting inside. I walked into the precinct gate, grabbed a weapon from the rack, and went forward to help. The leaders were the wounded soldiers Lei Weichen, etc.' They all confessed without reservation. Checking that pedestrians keeping to the left is originally to maintain traffic, and this bureau has repeatedly received orders from above to implement it, and no accidents have occurred. Jiao Zhenxiang, as a cook, disobeyed instructions and assaulted a police officer, which can be said to be due to a lack of knowledge. However, the soldiers of the training institute have long been educated and should strictly abide by discipline and assist the police officers in maintaining public order. Instead, they gathered to commit violence, surrounded the police station, beat and injured police officers, seized telephones, and destroyed public property, which is like being uncivilized. The situation has been reported to Li Lingkai, the Security Commander of Hunan Province." "Chen Chunsheng, the wounded soldier who committed violence in the Outer East Police Precinct, is to be executed by firing squad by the bureau." Upon receiving this order, in addition to supervising the extraction of the convict Chen Chunsheng and binding him to the execution ground to carry out the execution according to law, we are issuing this announcement to inform the public. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Inspection Record of the Bandit Area in Southern Jiangxi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: The reporter recently accompanied the China Vocational Education Delegation to inspect the bandit area in southern Jiangxi. After spending ten days and traveling over 1,800 li by land and water, we reached Guangchang County in the southern border of the newly recovered bandit area. The following is a record of what we saw and heard during the inspection.</p>
<p>The original registration for the delegation included more than seventy people. The day before departure, the following news was received: (1) The weather in the front is even hotter than in Nanchang (Nanchang has already reached 108 degrees), and diseases are a concern. Those who are weak should not go. (2) The bandit suppression work in the front is intense, and there is a lack of all hospitality. One must bring one's own camp bed, toiletries, dry food, rain gear, mosquito net, medicines, etc. Therefore, only twenty-six people departed. After arriving in Nanchang, the 16th Army Headquarters prepared five special vehicles and assigned Adjutant Yang Chaohua of the Liaison Section to take care of the vehicles and Adjutant Xie Shaoshan and Li Baofu of the Propaganda Section to provide hospitality along the way. We departed from the Department of Education at 7:00 AM. The vehicles traveled at a speed of 40 mph, with each vehicle separated by about half a mile. The words "Army Headquarters Special Vehicle" were prominently written on the front of the vehicles, so we were able to pass through customs and fortresses without hindrance. At around 10:00 AM, we arrived in Linchuan. The Northern Route Headquarters was organized in October last year and was originally stationed in Linchuan. This April, Guangchang was recovered, and the headquarters moved to Nancheng. Linchuan is the old Fuzhou Prefecture city and the hometown of Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty. After the special vehicles refueled at the station, they continued towards Nancheng. It was noon, and the sun was blazing. Pedestrians were sweating profusely. At around 1:00 PM, we arrived at the outskirts of the city. Blockhouses, fortresses, and various fortifications were everywhere. Adjutant Chief Mao Naigong and Special Commissioner Zhang Ying greeted us outside the city and led us in small cars to the Catholic Church in the city for rest. Food and lodging were prepared. The church house was tall and deep, and the trees were tall, making us feel refreshed. Subsequently, the Commander-in-Chief sent Chief of Staff Han Deqin to entertain us at the mansion. After the meal, a large bamboo cloth map of the bandit suppression area was hung on the wall, and a simple report was made, the gist of which was that the Communist bandits had plagued Jiangxi for nearly eight years. In the beginning, it was only a corner of the land. In 1930, they gradually became rampant. In 1931, the Central Eighteenth Division's suppression was unsuccessful, and He Yingqin was sent to supervise the suppression in Jiangxi, but this also failed. In that year, there was a major flood disaster in the Huai River basin, and the government was unable to attend to domestic affairs. Then the September 18th and January 28th incidents occurred, with domestic and foreign troubles pressing in. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek had just left Jiangxi to go north when the Eighteenth Army's bandit suppression suddenly failed again, and Nanchang was on the verge of danger. Chiang had no choice but to return to Jiangxi and sit in Nanchang, and the bandit forces did not expand further. However, the bandit flames were very fierce on the border between Jiangxi and Fujian, and the government troops were exhausted. Counties such as Ningdu and Xingguo were repeatedly recovered by the Central Army, but because they went deep into the bandit area and the rear was not secure, the bandits took the opportunity to attack from the rear, forcing them to retreat. The people were slaughtered by the bandits because they pointed out that the people had helped the government troops during the advances and retreats. After that, the people dared not trust the government soldiers and moved with the bandits. Since the Central Army changed its bandit suppression plan and adopted the principle of defending every inch and every foot of land, and after the blockhouses and highways were completed, the rear of the land that had been obtained was consolidated, and military transport was accessible before proceeding further. Since Guangchang was recovered, the people saw that the Central Army was not only able to attack but also to defend, and the displaced people all returned to their fields. This is a good phenomenon of the recent bandit suppression. (20th)</p>
<h3>Current Economic Situation in the Chao-Shan Area of Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Export of Local Products Plummets, Silver Shops Collapse with Huge Debts. Under the Exploitation of Heavy Taxes and Levies, the Rural Economy of Chao-Shan is Declining Day by Day. In addition, the frequent intrusion of imported goods such as foreign sugar and foreign rice makes it impossible for all local products to gain a foothold. Plums, fresh fruits, canned vegetables, and radish ingredients, which were originally major exports of Chao-Shan, are also sluggish and suffer losses due to the foreign depression. As for the Nanyang Islands, which serve as the "reservoir" of Chao-Shan, they have also been hit by the economic downturn. The prices of local products such as rubber, tin, coconut, and fish essence have plummeted, and overseas Chinese businesses have completely collapsed. The remittances from overseas Chinese, which have been used to supplement the economic balance of Chao-Shan over the years, have gradually decreased from 38 million yuan in 1931. Therefore, general purchasing power has also decreased accordingly, and the market is becoming increasingly depressed.</p>
<p>A dozen years ago, during the heyday of Chao-Shan's business, the market was flooded with silver dollars, reaching as much as four or five million yuan. Combined with the banknotes issued by various silver shops, the total was about seven million yuan, so the market finance was extremely abundant. It was also very easy for various trades to borrow money from silver shops. By last year, with the decline of commerce, various trades successively closed down. The silver dollars circulating in the market, due to environmental influences, shrank to just over one million yuan. The guaranteed banknotes were reduced to only two million yuan due to bank runs in various silver shops, totaling four million yuan, which was two million yuan short of the number circulating. Furthermore, at the end of last year, silver shops such as Chen Yuan Dazhuang, Cheng Maozhuang, Guangfa, Zhifa, Hongfa, Jiafa, Qianxingchang, and others successively closed down, owing more than several hundred thousand yuan to the streets. Chao-Shan's finance was thus in a state of decline. The exchange offices, therefore, requested and were approved by the East District Pacification Office to issue 1.5 million yuan of non-redeemable white notes to regulate the situation. However, this was still not enough to save the crisis. Since this spring, the economic panic has become increasingly serious. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly requested the Finance Department to approve the issuance of 10 million yuan of commercial warehouse certificates. The Finance Department has approved the issuance of 8 million yuan, and the Warehouse Certificate Issuance Committee was established on the 17th of this month. The warehouse certificates have already been printed in Hong Kong with 55,000 sheets, including 15,000 sheets with a face value of 200 yuan and 50,000 sheets with a face value of 100 yuan. The paper quality is dark yellow, interspersed with blue borders. Currently, those that have been printed and shipped to Shantou first include 3 million yuan with a face value of 100 yuan and 1 million yuan with a face value of 200 yuan. The financial community may be able to temporarily stabilize for a while from this.</p>
<p>The current commercial situation has not improved. Shop closures are heard every day. From January to May, no less than a dozen shops have closed down. The situation in other counties is the same. Just taking Anbu as an example, eleven shops closed down in January, seventeen in March, and twelve in May. The decline of commerce is evident.

<h3>Abolition of the Second Batch of Exorbitant Taxes and Levies</h3>

Zhenjiang News: Jiangsu Province's abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, in addition to the forty-two most harsh and detailed types of taxes and levies in the counties, amounting to approximately 110,000 yuan, which were the first batch and were abolished in June, the Finance Department has now abolished ninety-seven types of taxes and levies that were not included in the budget of the counties in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], amounting to approximately 300,000 yuan, as the second batch, effective from July. The Finance Department is also working on the third and fourth batches. It is also heard that the compensation method for the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies in Jiangsu Province is that the first and second batches do not require compensation because they are harsh, detailed, and not included in the budget. The third batch will be compensated by the revenue from the counties' reorganization of finances. As for the fourth batch, the revenue from the central government's allocation of stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax will be used to comprehensively compensate.

Zhou was from a village in Lihé County. He had an affair with Hu, the wife of Yao Guangfu, a villager. Later, on June 14th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], Zhou went to Yao's house to help with work. On the 20th of the same month, under the pretext of celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival, Zhou and Ming conspired to kill Yao.

<h3>Wu Zhihui Sends Letters to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Requesting Maintenance of Rong Zongjing's Enterprise. Rong Zongjing (Desheng, Kunshēn), a magnate of the industry and a fellow villager, operates the yarn and flour industries and is a giant in our country. Recently, due to the impact of social depression, he has experienced financial difficulties. The government authorities are planning relief. However, Shenxin No. 3 Yarn Factory in this town, Shenxin No. 1 and No. 8 Yarn Factories in Shanghai, and Shenxin No. 4 Yarn Factory in Hankou all have other shareholders and are not within the scope of the Shen Maofu Sanxin Company. Moreover, the above factories have annual surpluses and cannot be treated as a whole. It is learned that Central Committee member Wu Zhihui has recently sent separate letters to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang Jingwei, Minister Chen Shi, etc., requesting that they find ways to maintain Rong's enterprise.</p>
<h3>Provincial Commissioner Comes to Wuxi to Investigate Accumulated Grain</h3>
<p>Yu Jingtang, Commissioner of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, because of the severe drought and lack of rain, and the disaster situation has been formed, and the famine prevention accumulated grain handled by the counties has not yet been fully reported, and for the sake of organizing warehousing, special commissioners have been sent to the counties in Jiangnan that have been more severely affected by the drought to investigate. Those counties that have not handled the accumulation of grain should supervise the respective county governments to concentrate financial resources and rush to handle the accumulation of grain to meet the needs. Yu Bingxun, the commissioner sent to this county for investigation, arrived in Xi yesterday (the 20th) to supervise County Magistrate Yan to conduct a detailed investigation. The total accumulated grain in the county is 5,727 stones and 4 catties, worth 17,582 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen and 1 li. Also, the Provincial Department ordered the counties of Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changzhou to restrict rice prices and not exceed the corresponding prices to reassure the people. In recent days, the rice price in the county has slightly recovered, with high-grade white rice at 10 yuan and 8 jiao per stone.</p>
<h3>Farmers Dredge River and Discover Gold Brick</h3>
<p>For the sake of urgently rescuing the drought disaster, the villagers in the Gaocheng'an area of the New Fifth District voluntarily gathered to dredge the Xinqiao River. Chen Xinggen's son, Bu Rong, a villager in his twenties, was also working. Unexpectedly, yesterday, he suddenly discovered a two-foot square gold brick at the bottom of the river at that location. The words "Tongzhi" and other characters were engraved on it. It is thought that during the Taiping Rebellion, wealthy people buried gold in the river to avoid disaster, and it has only now been discovered. It is currently being preserved by Chen Yongchao, the head of the 15th tutang township of the area, and weighs nine catties and four taels, worth approximately 14,800 yuan. The method of disposal will be discussed publicly.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Resigns to Take Responsibility</h3>
<p>The county government of this town cracked a large batch of opium at the house of Jia Boqin outside the South Gate last month and detained Jia for investigation. As a result, Jia was fined 400 yuan and released. At that time, the general public thought that Jia was a well-known opium dealer, so why was he not sentenced? Later, Song Baojun separately submitted reports to the Nanchang Army Headquarters, the Control Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Provincial Government to accuse County Magistrate Zhou Heng of receiving a bribe of 3,000 yuan, which was handled by his younger brother Zhou Xuchen and Zhang Younan, the chief of the West Bureau grain levy. The Supervisory Yuan specially ordered the provincial government to secretly investigate and handle the matter. The provincial government secretly sent commissioners to Chang to investigate. At that time, the county magistrate's younger brother Zhou Xuchen and Zhang Younan had already absconded after hearing the news. Therefore, only Jia Boqin and another person involved, Fang Jimin, were arrested and escorted to the province. They have confessed that Zhang Younan and others had handled the matter, that they were unable to raise the full amount at the time, and that Zhang paid 200 yuan to settle the matter. The province has now decided to thoroughly punish them. However, County Magistrate Zhou Heng, due to the expansion of the situation, felt that he could not shirk his responsibility for oversight and has now submitted his resignation to the province to take responsibility.</p>
<h3>Two Inches of Rain Received in Recent Days</h3>
<p>In order to provide drought relief, the county has decided to use 32,000 yuan from the famine relief fund to purchase water pumps and boats for emergency relief. Later, the director of the agricultural center was appointed to go to Shanghai to negotiate the purchase of sixteen pumps. However, recently, due to the severe drought everywhere, the water pump business is booming. The purchaser in this county, because he did not bring cash, telegraphed Chang to remit it quickly, but most of them had already been purchased. Only ten were obtained, which are scheduled to be shipped to Chang on the 21st. The weather has been slightly cooler here in recent days, with showers every night. On the afternoon of the 19th, there was continuous rainfall, and all townships received rain. According to statistics, the rainfall in the past few days has been about two inches. Since then, rice prices have slightly fallen, and farmers have a chance to rest.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case at Henglin Station Workshop</h3>
<p>The case of Cui Yungui, the foreman of Workshop No. 19 at Henglin Station in Wuyi East, who received a contribution of 410 yuan in Wuxi on the 17th of last month and hid it in the workshop, was cracked. Unexpectedly, bandits learned of this and suddenly came to the workshop on the evening of the 18th at 9:00 PM, surrounding the workshop. Then, four armed bandits entered the room to rob, completely looting the contribution money and clothing, and fled towards the east side of the railway. On the way, they also robbed villagers Qin Erda and Xue Fengjun of more than ten yuan in hidden money. After the incident, the responsible public security substation reported the case and pursued the bandits without success. Recently, the police section of the Su Dan First Section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station stationed in Changzhou has strictly arrested the bandits at various stations in Suzhou and Wuxi. Four bandits, Wang Hanzhang, Liu Quanmei, Li Wanqing, and Zhang Lixiang, have been arrested in Li Kou, Suzhou, Wuxi Station, and Workshop No. 16 outside the South Gate of Wuxi. They were sent to the Shanghai Lianglu Police Station for interrogation. The police station considered that the location of the crime was in Changzhou and specially dispatched a police chief and three police officers to escort the four bandits to Chang by car on the 19th. They were sent to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation at about 3:00 PM. After the court opened for interrogation, it ordered them to be detained and wait for the plaintiffs to appear in court for questioning and verification.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu County Government specially convened a temporary meeting to discuss remedies for the drought disaster. Nineteen people attended, including the county district chief, the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, and others. County Magistrate Ma chaired the meeting and decided on the remedies, roughly as follows: (1) The agricultural extension stations in various districts should persuade the drought-stricken areas to switch to planting mung beans and buckwheat. The seeds will be borrowed from the landlords by the tenant farmers, and the county will issue an announcement. (2) Regulate the current rural finance, organize warehouse pledges, and contact the Agricultural Bank to borrow money. (3) Kill drought insects such as the black tiger and prevent locust plagues. (4) Instruct the district offices to ascertain the drought-stricken areas, list them, draw maps, and report them to the county for on-site verification, and separately request a reduction or exemption from the second-term land price tax in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. In order to prevent high rice prices and food hoarding, the Chamber of Commerce will first notify the grain merchants to pay attention, and if necessary, the county will decide on temporary measures.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Drug Trafficker's Bribery Case</h3>
<p>Pu Zhuping, the manager of the Hai'men China-British Pharmacy, was arrested by the Nantong District Commissioner's Office for selling drugs. Fearing punishment, Pu enlisted Zheng Ge, a prison guard in Hai'men County, to get acquainted with Chen Yongsheng, the owner of the Nantong Henglong Timber Firm, hoping to bribe with 1,000 yuan. Commissioner Zheng learned of this and ordered County Magistrate Zhang of Hai'men to arrest Zheng Ge and send him to Tong. Chen Yongsheng escaped, and the Henglong Timber Firm has been sealed up by the county government. Pu Zhuping and Zheng Ge are currently being interrogated by Zhu Feiru, the military law officer of the commissioner's office.</p>
<h3>Qidong Defense Force Disarmament Training in Tongzhou</h3>
<p>The Qidong Defense Force, consisting of over 200 men, arrived in Tongzhou upon orders. Commissioner Zheng, due to the force's lack of discipline in Qidong, suddenly dispatched the Nantong police team on the night of the 18th to the Xisi residence, completely surrounding and disarming them. On the 19th, he sent a team to escort the confiscated weapons and ammunition to the Qidong County Government. The force is temporarily staying in Nantong for moral lectures. After the training period, they will be evaluated for retention or dismissal.</p>

<h3>Establishing Waterwheels to Relieve Drought</h3>
<p>Magistrate Bao, concerned about the severe drought, went to the provincial capital on the 16th with gentry members such as Zhu Danqing and Wu Shouying from the Chamber of Commerce, to plead with the Financial and Construction Bureaus to include the eastern and western rural areas and Huangtiangang, among eight regions, into the drought relief area. Initially, the bureaus, considering Jiangyin's proximity to the Yangtze River, did not consider the drought a significant issue. However, after Magistrate Bao's repeated explanations, they agreed to allocate 20,000 yuan, to be drawn from the county's construction fees. Huangtiangang was approved as the 18th water pumping station, using electricity to power two waterwheels. Engineer Xu Qipeng and station resident Shao Peng arrived in Cheng on the 18th, along with Section Chief Cui, to inspect the Dingqing Gate and the earth dam east of the city, and review the port diagrams. They determined that Lubu Port was the most important and decided not to build a dam at Qing Gate, as it would impede traffic. Instead, they resolved to build a dam at the Xinhe Estuary and pump water day and night. The Xinhe project is expected to be completed within three days. On the 19th, Engineer Xu inspected the western rural ports. It is estimated that the installation of the waterwheels will have to wait until the machinery arrives from Shanghai, which will take at least five days to implement. On the 18th, a large number of locust nymphs appeared in Yangku West and the Fourth Bao of Suhu Zhuji, among other places, already winged and able to fly, gnawing at the rice seedlings. District Head Cheng Hongrui urgently telephoned the county government to report and convened farmers from nearby villages to capture them.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise Amid Severe Drought</h3>
<p>This year's severe drought and heat in our county are unprecedented in decades. The thermometer has risen to 110 degrees. Due to the prolonged drought, the crops in the surrounding countryside are mostly withered. Although there have been signs of rain in recent days, it has not fallen. As a result, rice prices continue to rise. High-quality rice has risen to 11.8 yuan, medium-quality rice to 11.4 yuan, and low-quality rice to 10 yuan, causing great panic among the common people.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<h3>Villagers Petition for Relief, Destroy Auditorium</h3>
<p>Due to the drought disaster in Jiaxing, six or seven hundred villagers from the Sixth District marched to He on the 19th, carrying withered rice stalks, to petition the county government for relief. On the 20th, more than a thousand farmers from the northeast, southeast, Guantang, and Baofu villages of the Fifth District, due to food shortages and no hope for the autumn harvest, were driven to hunger. They also carried dry rice seedlings and walked along the railway to the county to ask for relief, requesting exemption from rent and taxes, and the distribution of granary rice. Magistrate Jiang went out to meet them, comforted the villagers, and expressed his acceptance of their requests. Most villagers expressed satisfaction and dispersed. However, a small number of villagers, driven by hunger, rushed to the Second Hall (now the auditorium), demanding that the magistrate provide them with lunch. They were prevented from advancing by the police and county security teams present, causing the farmers to destroy the desks and wooden panels on the left side of the Second Hall. Subsequently, Wang Ziliang, the district head of the Fifth District, persuaded them and gave each person two pancakes. By 3:00 PM, they dispersed and returned to their homes. Currently, the county government, fearing that unscrupulous elements might take the opportunity to incite trouble, has issued a notice strictly prohibiting such actions, and those found will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Tragedy Occurs During Villagers' Rain Prayers</h3>
<p>Villagers in Chongde County, eager to pray for rain, brought idols into the city to seek rain and placed the Dragon King idol inside the county government, allowing villagers to pray for rain. On the 18th, over a thousand farmers wanted the magistrate to pay his respects in person and forced him to come outside. Someone shouted to hit him. The magistrate had no choice but to flee into the upper room. The villagers swarmed in, causing immediate chaos. The police officers' attempts to stop them were ineffective, so they opened fire, killing two farmers and injuring many others. When the villagers heard the gunshots and fled, many more were trampled.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Important Chinese and Japanese Figures</h3>
<p>Negotiated Sino-Japanese diplomacy in North China at Tang Youren's residence yesterday, but all declined to disclose the contents, according to the Far Eastern News Agency. Tang Youren's residence in Ganse Dong Road, Gan Village, this port, held a meeting once yesterday. From 9:45 AM to 12:10 PM. In addition to Tang himself, Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou, and Li Zeyi, a member of the Pingzheng Consolidation Council who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Fujian, there was also Ono Manabu, the Chinese counselor of the Japanese embassy. Although everyone denied holding a meeting in their statements, saying it was just a casual talk, it is widely believed that their meeting was to discuss Sino-Japanese negotiations in North China. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Yin arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday afternoon after leaving Mogan Mountain. Then took the 5:50 express train to Shanghai. Arrived at the port quietly at 10:35 PM. After getting off at the North Station, he went directly to the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road, under the pseudonym Liu, and stayed in the closed room on the seventh floor of the hotel.</p>
<h3>Meeting Process</h3>
<p>First, Mr. Ono Manabu drove to Mr. Tang's residence at 9:45 AM. Then Mr. Yin Tong arrived in a car with black license plates of the Municipal Council No. 2024 and the Public Utilities Bureau No. 6183 five minutes after Ono. Then the meeting began. Mr. Ono left at 10:50. Later, Mr. Li Zeyi arrived to participate. Until 12:10, Mr. Yin and Mr. Li left together. The meeting lasted for more than two hours. As for the content of the meeting, everyone kept silent and claimed it was "just a casual talk."</p>
<h3>Ono's Talk</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Ono, when leaving Mr. Tang's residence, he told the Far Eastern News Agency reporter that he was visiting Vice Minister Tang and there was no official business involved. It was only a courtesy visit, because when Ambassador Arima and himself went to Beijing before, they were entertained by President Wang and Vice Minister Tang. Now that he learned that Vice Minister Tang had arrived in Shanghai, he came to express his gratitude. When the reporter asked about the Japanese attitude towards abolishing the Tanggu Agreement, he replied that this was a local issue and would be dealt with by the local authorities. In other words, it was a matter between the Kwantung Army authorities and the North China local authorities. If there were any negotiations in the future, they would be conducted by these two, and the central governments of the two countries would only monitor from the sidelines.</p>
<h3>Li Zeyi's Talk</h3>
<p>When Mr. Li Zeyi had just arrived at Mr. Tang's residence, the Far Eastern News Agency reporter rushed forward to inquire. He said that he had come to visit Vice Minister Tang after learning that he had arrived in Shanghai. He did not know that there was any meeting at Mr. Tang's residence. Then he said that the situation in Fujian Province was still quiet. The rumors that the Japanese were plotting various things in Fujian were too exaggerated and not credible. The meeting of Japanese consuls in South China in Taiwan was a routine annual event. As for the content of this meeting, we have no way of knowing. Mr. Li then told the reporter that Tao Shangming had not gone to Changchun. Today's (ie yesterday's) newspaper reported a telegram from Tianjin, claiming that he had rushed to Changchun to discuss the war zone, which was not accurate.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong's Talk</h3>
<p>Mr. Yin Tong made the following statement to the reporter when leaving Mr. Tang's residence. First, he said that Chairman Huang (郛) still insisted on being passive, because his opinions could not be realized. It is still difficult to expect him to give up his resignation. However, if all parties take the overall situation as the premise and enable his opinions to be realized, then his resignation can be dismissed. Then he said that he had come to visit Vice Minister Tang just for a "casual talk."</p>
<h3>Tang Youren's Talk</h3>
<p>Later, the reporter visited Mr. Tang Youren in the afternoon. Mr. Tang also denied that his meeting with Yin and others was a meeting. He said that Ono had come to visit to thank him and Ambassador Arima for receiving President Wang's invitation in Beijing, and did not mention anything else. As for Yin Tong's visit, he only briefly talked about urging Mr. Huang Yingbai to return to the north. However, Ono and Yin Tong happened to meet, and they may have talked briefly in another room. Li Zeyi came to chat because he learned that I was in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Hits Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving tonight, the Shanghai Customs suspended signals yesterday and will fire cannons again today. The hurricane blew across the Taiwan Strait and advanced rapidly to the northwest-west. Yesterday, the Observatory continued to report that there were showers in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, showers near Shanghai at six o'clock, and bad weather and large cyclones in the East China Sea. The hurricane blew into the coast of Fuzhou yesterday morning, and its direction was still northwest-west. It is expected that the hurricane will advance to the Zhejiang Strait after reaching the coast of Fuzhou and then come to Shanghai. The wind force is extremely strong, with a total of four wind heads. The azimuth of its blow-in is at 120 degrees east longitude and 26 degrees north latitude. The Shanghai shipping companies have been informed and have forwarded this warning to the Shanghai-Minnan, Zhejiang, Nanhua, and Putuo routes that are en route, so that they can take precautions quickly. At 5:00 PM, the Jianghai Customs also hung a hurricane warning signal, a black ball during the day and a red light at night, to notify all ships that have not yet sailed in the Huangpu River to take precautions in advance to avoid being too late. After 5:00 PM, many punts, barges, and civilian boats on the Huangpu River sailed into the Suzhou River and the Old Port to take temporary shelter. The Shanghai-based Jianghai ships also dropped their double chain anchors and increased their mooring power. However, the Shanghai-Ningbo route ships Xining and Shao, and other Zhejiang coastal ships, still sailed out as usual. After arriving at Wusong, they will wait for the Observatory's warning. It is heard that the hurricane may arrive in Shanghai tonight. The ships on the Huangpu River have been prepared in advance. The Maritime Customs will fire cannons to warn again when it receives a definite warning that the hurricane will arrive in Shanghai. The Nanhua ships of various companies have thrown anchor on the way to avoid the hurricane, and the arrival dates will be delayed.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing</p>
<h3>Went to the Company to Handle Business Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recovered health after a week of recuperation, resumes full responsibility for business operations. According to Huadong News Agency, the industrial tycoon Rong Zongjing had previously retreated to recuperate due to physical discomfort, and had invited Wang Yuqing, deputy manager of Fuxin General Company, and Li Shengbo of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to respectively preside over the flour and yarn factory affairs. Since Rong's retirement, it has had a considerable impact on society, and the Ministry of Industry has paid close attention to it and has considered ways to organize assistance. Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in this port that Rong had returned to the company to take charge of affairs. The Huadong News Agency reporter specifically inquired at the company. According to Mr. Sun Beixuan, the document director of the company, Mr. Rong had retired to recuperate due to illness, and had invited Mr. Wang Yuqing, the deputy manager of the company, to preside over the flour part, and Mr. Li Shengbo of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to preside over the yarn factory part. However, because Mr. Wang also felt unwell and Mr. Li was busy with his own tasks, he declined. Mr. Wang has not been to the company for several days, and because Mr. Rong has had a week of recuperation, his health has gradually recovered, so he came to the company at 9:00 AM today (ie yesterday) to resume full responsibility for business operations, and all affairs have returned to their previous state.</p>
<p>Flour Manufacturers</p>
<h3>Dangerous Period Passed</h3>
<p>A large amount of flour is exported, especially to the Northeast, according to the Central News Agency. Flour manufacturers had previously experienced panic due to the sharp drop in flour prices, and some factories had to announce reduced working hours. The Ministry of Industry sent staff to Shanghai to investigate and consult with manufacturers on relief measures. A reporter met with flour merchants yesterday and was told that the panic among flour manufacturers was entirely due to the lack of sales. Now that wheat prices are relatively cheap, the cost is lower, and sales are easier. Recently, a large amount of flour has been exported, especially to the Northeast, so from the current observations, the dangerous period for the flour industry has passed, and all manufacturers have returned to their previous state.</p>
<h3>Huang's Visit to Mogan Mountain</h3>
<p>= Huang revealed a negative tone because things did not go as desired. The political situation is tricky because there are too many trivial issues = A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency believes that the North China political situation is important, but Huang 郛 is staying on Mogan Mountain, and officials come and go without a virtual day. There must be political news, so I personally went to Mogan Mountain. After this trip, I met Huang 郛 and Yin Tong and talked with them. I learned that the North China affair was not simple at first. Now I have written down my reporter's observations and feelings after returning to Shanghai. I think readers also want to know it urgently. The North China affair produced the Political Committee during the military period last year, adhering to the will of the central government and helping the local government. Its first task was to assist the military sub-committee in handling the recovery of the eastern counties since the Tang-Zhang Agreement. Fortunately, it has been completed. However, it is called a war zone, but there is no specific plan for all aftermaths. Because we are restricted, bandits and vagrants have stolen a lot, and it is difficult to crack down. The current training of special police is related to public security. As for the Zhao Lei, Liu Zuo Zhou, and other departments must be retrained in order to be transferred out of the war zone in the future.</p>
<h3>Military Agreement</h3>
<p>For temporary and local affairs, two years have passed since the end of the war. Everything must be done according to normal rules from now on. But now, due to the armistice agreement, all war zone incidents must be targeted by the Kwantung Army. Is this a long-term solution? Moreover, diplomacy is originally a national matter. There is an armistice agreement under the fire, and now when it comes to the aftermath of the war zone, all negotiations should be transformed from military to diplomatic, from local to central, in order to have a thorough and complete solution. As the reporter thinks, even the armistice agreement was made by the central government, so the current transfer from local diplomacy to the entire national negotiation with Japan is also consistent with the principles and should not be difficult to achieve. As for other trivial matters in North China, such as the Eastern Mausoleums, the Japanese often use the excuse of sending troops. I don’t know that the land and tombs belong to ancient monuments. In modern</p>
<h3>Civilized countries</h3>
<p>Since we do not punish wives and children, how can we move disaster to withered bones? Their excuse is obvious. Fortunately, we are now prepared to invite former Qing royals who are not attached to the puppet state to form a management committee. As for the Japanese side, due to the armistice agreement, they regard Luandong and other places as war zones and insist on using military means for negotiations. It can be imagined that they attach importance to the Kwantung Army and do not want to transform the normal state of diplomacy. However, North China is a part of China, and it is bound to be difficult to discuss negotiations with the military organs of others locally. The difficulties of the Political Committee are also due to the large number of trivial issues. Therefore, Huang 郛, who has been living in Mogan Mountain for many years, bears a heavy burden again, and sometimes feels that things do not go as desired, so he cannot help but reveal a negative tone. If things can be accomplished and politics and strategies are in harmony, it is not a pity to sacrifice oneself. If it is known that it is impossible, if it is not appropriate to do it, then why should someone who is known to be difficult to advance and easy to retreat take the position of vegetarian meals? As for the current situation, the agreement</p>
<h3>Has not been abolished</h3>
<p>When the opponent is still the Kwantung Army, they cannot but negotiate, and the trivial matters cannot be solved by treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts. Fortunately, the final decision and the implementation plan are decided and implemented by the central government. After finishing the official business, the reporter wandered in the mountains and rivers, and</p>
<h3>Mogan Elementary School</h3>
<p>There are enough records. The school was founded by Huang 郛 many years ago. The aim is to popularize education and recruit children from farmers' families to study. In the past, farmers often felt that reading would lead to the abandonment of farming, but this school takes both sides into account. During the spring ploughing season, students are released from school to go home. After the farming is completed, they go back to school, and the summer vacation is extended to make up for it. Therefore, this year's summer vacation will not be held until the 19th. I was able to participate in its grandness. The houses are well-arranged, with a lecture hall in the middle. The words "farming and reading" are hung on it as a lesson.</p>
<p>Said: Self-governance, self-defense, self-education, mutual friendship, mutual assistance, mutual support, the spirit of rural cooperation can be seen here. Hundreds of people came that day, students and parents gathered together, and the etiquette was grand. In the past, there were no families in Geng Village at the foot of the mountain. Today, there is this school, and houses are everywhere. It can be seen that things are done by people. The reporter saw this school that values ​​both farming and reading, and his joy was more interesting than visiting any university. Therefore, I attach it here.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Department</p>
<h3>Dissatisfied with Japanese Ambassador Arima</h3>
<p>Saying that his understanding of China is insufficient. According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 15th, the military department is maintaining a close monitoring attitude towards the National Government regarding the direction of diplomacy with China since the resolution of the North China transportation problem. However, recently there have been frequent rumors of cooperation between Ning and Yue, and that Hu Hanmin will be invited to Beijing. Such news is probably not reliable, but the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arima, actually believes it to be true and has repeatedly reported it to the authorities. The military department is very dissatisfied with Ambassador Arima's lack of understanding and advocates for the selection of a new ambassador to China. Moreover, the crisis of 1936 is approaching, and Army Minister Lin is advocating for the expansion and strengthening of diplomatic functions, hoping that foreign envoys will take appropriate and effective measures. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no way of knowing how to react.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Suggest Purchasing Foreign Rice</p>
<h3>City Farmers' Association Asks for Caution</h3>
<p>The City Farmers' Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing on the 19th, addressed to Chen Jun, Minister of the Ministry of Industry. This year, since the beginning of summer, it has been extremely hot and rainless, and the farmland has suffered severe drought. The soil in the fields has been cracked, and various crops have gradually withered. The clouds and rain do not come, and there is no way to draw water. The disaster is already formed, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Although the city has started drought relief work, purchasing water pumping machinery and distributing it to various districts, drawing water from large rivers and injecting it into small ports to facilitate farmers' water extraction for irrigation, farmers lack funds and are unable to draw water. We urgently hope that the government will allocate funds for relief or negotiate with banks to release funds so that they can come to Su. The establishment of our country has always been based on agriculture, and the cultivation of the foundation of the country cannot be slackened. We urgently send a telegram to your excellency, asking you to submit it to the provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan this Saturday for resolution so that it can be implemented. As for the issue of importing foreign rice and exempting it from national taxes, although it is to enrich the people's food, the source of profit is overflowing, and breaking the tariff barriers is not a good plan. It only makes merchants fatten their pockets and burdens farmers. The association believes that it should be carefully considered. First, conduct an investigation and compile statistics on the rice reserves in various provinces to see if they are sufficient to meet the national food supply before the new grain is harvested, and then decide whether to purchase foreign rice. Otherwise, there will be no scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Today's Performance of New Aircraft</h3>
<p>The program includes crazy flying. Cai, Kong, Mayor Wu, and others participated. The Far East Aircraft Company will perform the effectiveness of its latest newly arrived Snow Fox double-seat fighter reconnaissance aircraft at Hongqiao Airport at 5:30 PM today. Leaders from all walks of life at home and abroad have been invited to participate. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu, British Consul General Bailey Nan, and British Embassy Aviation Counselor Will Gao will all be present. It is heard that the performance program is divided into two parts. The first part is Hamilton, the instructor of the Hong Kong Flight Training School of the company, will fly the Avro 637 trainer to demonstrate the latest British aviation training methods. Hamilton's flying skills are extremely broad. After the performance, Hamilton will fly the plane to perform amazing crazy flying. Crazy flying has been the most popular in European flight competitions in recent years, but it is still a new concept in Shanghai. The second part is the performance of the latest Snow Fox high-efficiency two-seat fighter reconnaissance aircraft, which will be flown by British Flight Lieutenant Peng Naide, the manager of the Far East Aircraft Company in this port. Anyone holding the company's invitation can enter the airport to watch. At that time, a British band will be present to help cheer, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

This is also good news in the promotion of domestic products.</p>

<h3>English and American Tobacco Factory Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The party and government decided on six measures and ordered them to be followed. The old factory was approved to stop working and the workers were given three months' salary. The workers on strike in the new factory decided to resume work the next day. According to Da Gong She, after the British and American old factory in Pudong stopped production, two thousand eight hundred workers lost their jobs and their livelihoods were worrying. More than 4,000 workers in the second factory, out of sympathy and assistance, did not hesitate to go on strike to ask the company to resume production. Since the wind wave occurred, it has been two months. The strike committee and the maintenance team worked day and night, so the order was well-maintained, which has never been seen in strikes before. The various situations have been seen in previous reports. Now, the party and government organs have discussed and decided on six solutions, and the workers have decided to resume work on Monday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Party and Government Decide on a Solution</h3>
<p>The stalemate in the labor dispute between the city's party and government organs and the British-American factory is unfavorable to both parties. After numerous mediations by Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Bureau Chief Wu, Municipal Party Committee members Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, and Jiang Huaixu, leaders from various circles Du Yuesheng, Shi Liangcai, Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, and Lu Jingshi, as well as the General Labor Union, a six-point solution has been decided upon. The Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Committee will jointly issue orders to the labor union and the company to accept the solution in order to quell the dispute. The original approved solution is recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the method of terminating the labor contracts of workers in the old factory, the company is to be instructed to grant three months' wages, as well as savings and annual bonuses. (2) Relief for workers during the strike at the new factory will be the responsibility of this association (government). Six yuan will be advanced for each person, to be paid in full within one week after resumption of work. The date and location will be determined separately. (3) If the closed old factory resumes operation in the future, the originally laid-off workers should be hired first, and given their original salaries. (4) After the workers in the new factory resume work, the company shall not dismiss workers without cause. (5) The original labor-management contract will remain in effect pending further review by this association (government). (6) All picket teams or maintenance teams organized by the striking workers in the past should be disbanded immediately.</p>
<h3>New Factory Workers to Resume Work on Schedule</h3>
<p>After receiving the solution determined by the party and government organs and being ordered to comply, the Fifth District Cigarette Trade Association immediately convened an emergency meeting for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that since the case had been decided through consultation between the party and government, in order to obey the orders of the party and government and the advice of leaders from various circles, they decided to express their acceptance. Workers have already been notified. At the same time, the striking workers in the new factory are scheduled to</p>
<p>resume work in the factory en masse the day after tomorrow (i.e., Monday). However, it is still reported that there are Communist elements who continue to incite unrest, but the general workers are unwilling to be used any further. Therefore, this serious labor dispute has come to an end.</p>

<p>Zhang Tianshi ascended the altar at 5 PM. Today at dawn, Zhang will continue to present a memorial. Philanthropists Wang Yiting, Xu Guannan, and Shao Ruxin, together with Buddhist masters Taixu, Qinghai, and Abbot Quefei, launched the "National Prayer Meeting for Rain and Disaster Relief for Drought-Stricken Areas."

<p>Overseas Chinese</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic About Domestic Industry</h3>
<p>Huang Hongjun to Set Sail Soon to Liaise for the Construction of a Large Model Village in Lujiawan Most overseas Chinese work as laborers and pass on their hardships through generations, unable to escape. Currently, they are affected by the economic panic in various countries around the world, resulting in strict restrictions on the entry of overseas Chinese. In many places, abuse and expulsion have occurred. Overseas Chinese compatriots, facing this harsh environment, all think of returning to their motherland. Therefore, returned overseas Chinese have repeatedly received complaints from overseas Chinese and inquiries about how to make a living and settle down with small capital after returning home. The local overseas Chinese community believes that this matter is related to the happiness of all overseas Chinese for generations and the personality of the entire nation. After several meetings and hearing that the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory plans to expand and relocate to Lujiawan, it was decided to discuss and urge the factory to double its expansion and build a large model village so that overseas Chinese can return home and enjoy a comfortable and prosperous life. Huang Hongjun, the general manager of the factory, went abroad at a young age and experienced the hardships of Chinese laborers for nearly 20 years. Although he worked hard to free himself from the sea of ​​suffering at that time, his heart to rescue overseas Chinese compatriots never ceased. He immediately agreed and purchased more than 400 acres of land in Lujiawan as the site for the large model village and as the factory base for expansion. More than 300 acres will be used for the large model village. Construction is planned to begin soon and is expected to be completed by June next year. The local overseas Chinese community has contacted overseas Chinese compatriots by telegram and letter many times, and a large number of overseas Chinese are preparing to return home to invest. Therefore, they urged Huang to go abroad immediately in order to realize this as soon as possible. The factory established an expansion preparatory committee at the East Asia Restaurant yesterday and publicly elected Zhao Shibei, Li Jin, Cao Yunxiang, Huang Hongjun, Zheng Lai, Luo Qianbo, Cai Zengji, Huang Fuxiang, and other 37 people as committee members to take charge of investment and design matters. Huang will set sail on August 4. It is expected that when Huang returns to China, he will bring back a large number of overseas Chinese compatriots to seek happiness for themselves and develop industries for the country.</p>

The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Loan Contract Signed</h3>
<p>Shaanxi is the region with the richest cotton production in China. The Cotton Control Committee has specially established the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute to guide farmers in cotton planting, with Xu Zhongyou as the director. It has also negotiated with the Shanghai banking community regarding loan matters. Six banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, and Four Provinces Farmers Bank, have organized a syndicate and signed a loan contract with the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute in Shanghai last month. The interest rate is 9%.</p>
<h3>Initial Allocation for Cotton Seedling Loans</h3>
<p>Regarding the loan methods, each bank will not set up separate offices in Shaanxi but will entrust the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute to handle the matter. The institute will assist farmers in organizing cooperatives and then, according to the contract, introduce the loans from each bank to the cooperatives organized by farmers. An initial allocation of 50,000 yuan from each bank, totaling 300,000 yuan, will be used as cotton seedling loans. This sum has been transferred by each bank to the Cotton Production Improvement Institute for lending to farmers.</p>
<h3>Decision to Cooperate with Farmers</h3>
<p>When farmers harvest cotton in the autumn, further loans will be provided to the cooperatives organized by farmers for production and machinery. The Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute will also find ways to transport and sell the produced cotton in Shanghai, implementing cooperation with farmers. When farmers have gained experience in transportation in the future, they will take over the management.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Re-elects</p>
<h3>Director of Nanshi Branch Office</h3>
<p>Ma Jiliang is Appointed Ke Ganchen was originally appointed as the director of the Nanshi Branch Office established by the City Chamber of Commerce. It is now learned that Mr. Ke has been elected as a standing committee member of the City Chamber of Commerce and cannot take care of the directorship concurrently. He sent a letter requesting to resign. The order was submitted to the fourth regular meeting yesterday, and it was decided to recommend Ma Jiliang to take on the role. It has been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Gu Xinyi Summoned to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Continue Planning for Grain Control Committee In order to regulate national grain, the central government convened a meeting in Beijing to discuss the establishment of a Grain Control Committee. Two discussions were held, but no substantial decision was made, so the meeting ended without results. Now, in order to promote its early realization, the central government has reconvened a second meeting. Mr. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, took the 11 PM express train to Beijing last night in response to the summons to attend the meeting. National Products Manufacturers Association</p>
<h3>Leads Factories to Zhenjiang Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>And Telegraphed Provincial Organs for Assistance The Jiangsu Provincial National Products Exhibition entrusted the city's National Products Manufacturers Association to collect national product manufacturers to participate in Zhenjiang. A total of more than 120 companies are busy loading goods these days. The staff assigned to participate in the exhibition will also depart for Zhenjiang on the 8 AM express train tomorrow morning. The association is deeply concerned that the staff participating in the provincial exhibition may be unfamiliar with the local conditions or have communication barriers. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to all sectors of the provincial capital to provide various conveniences and guidance to facilitate the promotion of national products.

The China National Products Manufacturers Association respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>Extension Granted for Rickshaw License</h3>
<p>Fei Xindun Meets with Yin Zhiling, Yu Qiaqing, and Others to Mediate Since the Public Works Department announced the new rules for public rickshaw licenses, requiring rickshaw owners to obtain a certificate issued by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to obtain a license from August 1, and requiring all rickshaw owners to obtain a certificate before July 21, otherwise no license will be issued, all rickshaw owners expressed their indignation. Due to dissatisfaction with the unreasonable measures of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, most have not yet obtained certificates and have requested the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association's Special Zone Office to negotiate with the Public Works Department on their behalf. If licenses are not issued, rickshaw pullers will lose their jobs, and if incidents occur, the rickshaw owners will not be responsible. The situation is very serious. Cheng Xiechun, chairman of the Jianghuai Guild Hall, considering that the city has more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers, most of whom are fellow Jianghuai countrymen, and in order to maintain the livelihood of the fellow countrymen and social order, especially invited Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing to mediate. Mr. Yu readily agreed to contact the Public Works Department to extend the implementation of the new regulations. The rickshaw owners' association also recommended Yin Zhiling to visit Fei Xindun, the director-general of the Public Works Department, yesterday morning to explain the reasons for the rickshaw owners' request to extend the implementation of the new regulations. In terms of time and procedures, an extension is indeed necessary. Mr. Fei met with them and invited Deputy Director-General Philip and Chairman Massey of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee to meet and discuss the results. An extension was granted for the license application date, but the new regulations still have to be implemented on schedule. Although the rickshaw owners have heard of the extension of the license application, they still have many objections to the implementation of the new regulations and need to discuss them in the long term. Yu Qiaqing has contacted the Public Works Department and scheduled a meeting with representatives of the rickshaw owners' association next Monday to discuss the implementation of the new rickshaw regulations.</p>

<h3>Compilation of News on Pig Business Tax Disputes</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance changed the pig business tax in Jiangbei to a contractor system, Chen Gao bid and contracted it. He did not comply with the regulations and illegally levied taxes, increasing the burden on pig merchants. The Shanghai Fresh Pig Dealers Association and the Jiangsu Provincial Fresh Pig Trade Association's Joint Office have sent telegrams to the authorities to appeal. The latest news from various parties is recorded below. The Jiangsu Provincial Government replied to the Shanghai Fresh Pig Dealers Association, saying, "The telegram has been received. The collection of 10/1000 business tax on the pig transportation industry in Jiangbei Province has been implemented for a long time and is not a recent increase. It should be handled in accordance with the case. As for the collection procedures, orders have been issued repeatedly to collect in accordance with the regulations and not to illegally solicit. Please be informed accordingly." In addition, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Jiangsu Provincial Fresh Pig Trade Association's Joint Office, saying, "The case has been reviewed. Previously, according to the office's request, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance was quickly ordered to withdraw the order to bid for the Jiangbei pig transportation business tax and collect taxes in accordance with the market and not to intercept ships for floating tax. The Jiangsu Provincial Government was consulted for verification and handling, and instructions were issued in each case. It is learned from the reply of the Jiangsu Provincial Government that the Jiangbei pig transportation business tax is due to the wide area and difficulty in inspection. It is necessary to send personnel to be responsible for special handling. The business tax is of a temporary nature and should be based on the value of the purchased goods as the business income and the business tax should be collected in accordance with the prescribed tax rate. No extra tax should be collected, and short reports should not be allowed. In addition to the Department of Finance transferring the order to comply with the regulations, it is strictly forbidden to make things difficult and extort money. A reply is sent for verification." In addition, Jiangbei fresh pig merchants Wang Zhikang, Liu Xinquan, Hong Chunfu, Yang Jiujian, Zong Zhilu, Wu Deru, Gao Mingsong, and others presented a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, saying, "The petition is for the Jiangbei pig business tax commissioner Chen Gao to resist the law, violate the regulations, and collect taxes harshly. He has privately increased tax checkpoints in inland areas along the river where there are no pig businesses, intercepting and extorting money, and oppressing the villagers. We pray that you will sympathize with the people's livelihood and punish them according to the law. We quickly order the Department of Finance to comply with the Ministry's order of 5/1000 to transfer the order for collection and revoke the tax checkpoints that have been privately added in the inland areas in order to relieve the crisis and maintain the law. Since we pig merchants have suffered from frequent banditry, the rural areas have been devastated. The deep water and fire are like the danger of morning dew. Those who have not gone bankrupt rely on the pig farming sideline to circulate and maintain a glimmer of hope. However, since Commissioner Chen Gao contracted the business tax, he regarded our pig merchants as a source of profit. He violated the tax regulations, privately increased the tax rate, levied 20/1000, exploited the blood and sweat of the people, and indulged in abuse and power, harboring the desire to fill his pockets. Our merchants are in a time of pig price decline, low grain prices, and agricultural livelihood urgently needs relief. Now, we are suffering from brutal destruction. How can we endure the pain? Even the harsh taxation of the past likin tax was not as poisonous as this. According to the Ministry of Finance's order No. 2752 on June 15, 20, the Jiangbei pig business tax should be handled in accordance with the precedent of Anhui Province, where agents pay on behalf of the government. The business tax should be paid at the rate of 5/1000 of the business amount each time, and not collected according to the number of pigs. We request that you consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government and transfer the order to the financial county magistrate to comply with this order." According to the Ministry of Finance's order No. 1269 on May 20, 23, the Jiangsu Provincial Business Association sent a telegram on behalf of the Jiangbei pig business tax, which was originally 5/1000. Now, the Department of Finance suddenly changed the bidding method and increased it to 10/1000. We request that you order the Department of Finance to withdraw the order and handle it in accordance with the precedent. This telegram has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to be transferred to the Department of Finance to comply with the handling. We did not expect Chen Gao to disregard the law and the plight of the farmers on the verge of collapse, and seriously violate the tax regulations. He dared to collect 20/1000. The farmers and merchants in Jiangbei who rely on pig farming as a sideline to make a living all want to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. Even the death penalty is difficult to cover up his crimes. On June 8, we read in the newspaper that the National Government ordered, "Taking from the people is an ancient principle. Establishing the country with agriculture should strengthen the foundation of the country." It is said that "From the date of the promulgation of the decree, it is forever forbidden to establish illegal tax items. This is established as a precedent to assist the central government in revitalizing the countryside and cultivating the national economy." We, the Junfu, supervised the Department of Finance to investigate 42 kinds of the harshest local miscellaneous taxes in each county, and consulted the Ministry of Finance for verification, etc. Upon hearing this, the king and ministers were happy, and from then on, the harsh taxes were eliminated, and the livelihood was guaranteed, so that those who had been subjected to cruel and violent power for a long time suddenly saw the sky and the sun. Therefore, we urgently file a petition, praying that you will review and pity the merchants in difficulty, and grant relief to cultivate the countryside, reduce suffering, quickly order the Department of Finance to investigate and comply with the Ministry's order of 5/1000, and order the pig business tax to comply with the handling, without adhering to formalities, and ignoring the law, and immediately revoke the privately set tax checkpoints, and request that Chen Gao, who stubbornly resists and illegally collects taxes, be punished according to the law, in order to eliminate evil and maintain the law. We are extremely grateful and await orders."</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Responds to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Liquor and Tobacco License Tax Handled in Accordance with Regulations</h3>
<p>Application forms can be filled out by each collection office on behalf of the soy sauce, liquor, tobacco, and alcohol industries. After the transfer of the power to levy the liquor and tobacco license tax to local governments, the city's Liquor and Tobacco Trade Association requested that new licenses be exchanged for old licenses as usual. This has been reported in previous newspapers. The person in charge of the bureau has now issued a statement, saying, "The bureau has received a letter from the city chamber of commerce regarding this case and has replied to the case. The so-called exchange of licenses as usual is to handle matters without following the rules. How can the bureau agree to this? As for the report that most of the merchants in the tobacco and alcohol industry have a small business scope and have difficulty filling out the application form, the bureau believes that the items that should be filled out in the application form are very simple. If no one can fill it out, the merchants can declare each item to each collection office, which can fill it out on their behalf, without any difficulty." The Finance Bureau's reply to the City Chamber of Commerce and the opinions of the merchants in the industry are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Reply to Chamber of Commerce Letter</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau replied to the City Chamber of Commerce, saying, "The bureau has received your letter No. 25, requesting that the liquor and tobacco license tax be approved to be exchanged for new licenses for the liquor and tobacco industries as usual. Upon investigation, it was found that the taxation method of the liquor and tobacco license tax during the Ministry's collection period has been changed several times, including inviting merchants to contract and selecting commissioners to collect taxes. The handling of the matters was inconsistent. If this is not corrected, it will not only easily breed abuses, but also make it difficult for merchants to bear the burden fairly. The bureau is aware of the above situation, so it has tried to correct it at the beginning of the takeover. It ordered all merchants to fill out the application form and report it to the collection agency for verification and issuance of the license. The main principle is to comply with the regulations of the ministry, verify the collection, and make the burden on merchants fair. In addition, the business of the store is inevitably increasing or decreasing, and it is impossible to verify the exchange of new licenses for old licenses. This refers to those who have old licenses. If new stores apply for licenses and do not comply with the regulations, there is no basis for collecting taxes. As for the difficulties of merchants, they should be considered, but they cannot go beyond the scope of the law. Therefore, the bureau believes that the petition of the representatives is unreasonable. It sent personnel to meet and explain, and approved that it should not be discussed, and reported it to the municipal government for filing. A reply is sent to the previous request. Please ask your chamber of commerce to inform the trade association to persuade the merchants in the industry to pay the money and obtain the license on time, so as to ensure the operation and pay attention to the tax policy. This is a public matter for the city chamber of commerce."</p>
<h3>Industry Opinions</h3>
<p>According to the opinions of the soy sauce, liquor, tobacco, and Fenjiu industries, the principle decided at the National Finance Conference is to reduce the burden on the people by abolishing the land tax surcharge and harsh taxes and miscellaneous taxes and transferring the liquor and tobacco license tax to local governments to supplement local finances. However, there is no land tax surcharge in the city, and there are no harsh taxes or miscellaneous taxes that can be cut. The transfer of the license to the city has already increased revenue. There is no need to increase it in the city. Recently, members have repeatedly reported that those who have registered and paid two yuan in taxes must add two yuan to obtain a license. Therefore, members request that the trade association convene a general meeting and schedule a joint petition to the municipal government. If there is no alternative, the tobacco and alcohol industries have the determination to stop selling tobacco and alcohol as a last resort.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Assistance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 300 tobacco and alcohol stores in Nanshi and Pudong appealed to the Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Association for assistance. The addresses and brand names are listed below: Guo Xiangfeng on Xundao Street, Nanshi; De Tai on Hainan West Street; Xin He Tai on Tangjiawan; Yong Tai Feng on Linyin Road; Yuan Kang on Fushantang Street; Yong Tai on Zixia Road; Shunfaxiang at Wangjia Wharf; Yao Jinchang, Cheng Ji, Tong Chunxiang, Zheng Da in Houjia Road; Chengda, Hu Yuanda, Yong Mao, Shi Yitai in Pudong; Rong Tai in Laobaidu, etc., a total of 352 stores, sent a letter to the Shanghai South Office of the Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Association (omitted). The Finance Bureau handled the license registration, ostensibly saying that it reduced the burden on the citizens, complied with the tax registration, and made the burden on the merchants fair. In fact, it implemented a tax increase. Now, Sheng Sheng Tai on Liyuan Road, Tong Sheng on Jumen Road, and many other stores have taken their old licenses and two yuan in taxes to register and pay, and received what they asked for. Later, personnel were sent to urge the collection and add two yuan to get a new license. Upon hearing this, our stores were extremely alarmed. In this time of economic depression, house donations and rents have increased, money is tight, and foreign prices have risen. Small businesses are unprofitable. It is difficult to maintain if taxes are collected according to the old amount. How can we bear to increase it again? Therefore, we are jointly making an urgent plea, appealing to your association to uphold justice and quickly submit it to the authorities, requesting consideration. Otherwise, we are willing to sacrifice and stop business together.</p>

<h3>Letter to Rescue Wang Shuqiao</h3>
<p>Using the obituary as evidence, lawyer Wang Shuqiao was suspected in the attempted assassination of Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station last year. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Wang and escorted him to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, where he has been detained for a long time. Wang's hometown (Hefei County, Anhui Province) compatriots' associations and local gentry jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Bar Association, requesting them to forward it to the Garrison Headquarters for his release. The correspondence between the Shanghai Bar Association and the Garrison Headquarters is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Bar Association Letter: Respected Sirs, We have received a joint letter from the Hefei County Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Bar Association, Newspaper Reporters' Association, and gentry Zhang Jianchu, Xu Ketang, Liu Junyao, Yang Licuo, and over twenty others. The letter states that they had sent a letter to your association in October of last year, proving that Wang Shuqiao was in his hometown handling funeral affairs during the time of the attempted assassination of Minister Song Ziwen at the Shanghai Railway Station and did not leave Hefei. They requested your association to forward the letter to Minister Song for verification. They also heard that Wang Shuqiao is currently being held in custody by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Our association has already sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters to provide evidence. (Omission)...They also requested our association to prove to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters that Wang Shuqiao has no connection with the Song case, so that he can be released as soon as possible and human rights can be upheld. They also attached Wang Shuqiao's obituary to the letter. After investigation, we found that lawyer Wang Shuqiao is extremely cautious and never interferes in external affairs. He is now implicated in this case and detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, then transferred to your headquarters, where he has been held for a long time. The losses in spirit and money are incalculable. Since he has been transferred to your headquarters for custody, his grievance should be clarified. Now that we have received the letter from various groups, organizations, and gentry in Hefei County as mentioned above, it further proves that lawyer Wang Shuqiao has absolutely no connection with the North Railway Station assassination of Song. Therefore, we are sending this letter with the attached obituary, requesting your careful consideration and granting the release of lawyer Wang Shuqiao immediately or sending him to the court for judgment. This is out of public duty. Sincerely, Shanghai Bar Association Standing Committee.</p>
<p>(2) Garrison Commander's Reply: Regarding the letter replying on the Wang Shuqiao case, we will review and handle it after a clear investigation. From the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Official Letter Fa Zi No. 1338: Received your letter stating that lawyer Wang Shuqiao has no connection with the North Railway Station assassination of Song and requesting his release or referral to the court for judgment. We acknowledge receipt. This case involves significant circumstances and will be reviewed and handled after a clear investigation. We are replying accordingly. Please take note. Sincerely, Wu Tiecheng, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.</p>

<p>Taxpayers' Association Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigate the Illegal Torture by the Police</h3>
<p>Evidence of the illegal torture by detectives with connivance as Lang Zuyin refused to answer the court summons and failed to show up. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director of the Public Works Department, requesting a strict investigation into the unauthorized use of illegal torture by police officers. Respected Sirs, We have received a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, which states: "Upon encountering a case, the Special District Police Department immediately resorts to electric torture to force confessions from detainees. These confessions are then used as evidence by the court, which, without proper examination, is misled and attaches the confession to the case file as a basis for judgment. As a result, countless innocent individuals are陷are陷陷被陷are陷陷被陷be trapped. Recently, in the case of Cai Yang, he was subjected to electric torture by the police department as many as seventeen times. A forensic examination confirmed that he was disabled. Subsequently, Chen Afu was also injured by electric torture and rendered incurable. Such inhumane actions are infuriating to anyone with a conscience. If no measures are taken to stop this, the consequences are unimaginable. Our association has repeatedly read reports and received a proposal from Standing Committee Member Zhang Yichen. We are corresponding with your department to request that you promptly negotiate with the authorities of the concession, ordering the abolition of this practice, to avoid public discontent."</p>
<p>After deliberation, the use of torture to force confessions and extract false statements is the greatest shame under the rule of law and the most immoral act for civilized humanity. Taking statements from suspects is the responsibility of the court magistrate, and it is not a legitimate act for the police department. According to investigations, the police department originally had instruments for implementing such torture, but they were removed by the current police chief after reorganization. The actions of detectives outside the police station are difficult to detect. Regardless of whether this is true, the fact that Lang Zuyin was not summoned and the police department did not exhaust its efforts to issue an arrest warrant indicates that the illegal torture by detectives is being condoned. Furthermore, the police department's investigative abilities can be described as meticulous, yet they claim to be completely unaware of the illegal torture by detectives outside the station, which is nothing more than burying one's head in the sand. Now, based on the aforementioned reasons, for the sake of the rule of law and civilization, we are corresponding with your bureau to request that all illegal torture by police officers, whether used inside or outside the police station, be stopped and strictly investigated. Sincerely, To the Director of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Investigating the Italian Sailors Case</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Municipal Government yesterday announced the handling of the case of Italian sailors assaulting rickshaw pullers on Qiujiang Road and the death of an Italian sailor from a covert attack. The details of the case of Italian sailors assaulting rickshaw pullers on Qiujiang Road and the death of an Italian sailor from a covert attack have been reported in various newspapers. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government, in addition to lodging a protest with the Italian consulate regarding the assault by the Italian sailors, also strictly ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrest the real culprit in the covert attack on the Italian sailor. According to the report, a suspect named Ma Taichang has been arrested, and considerable evidence has been collected. He was escorted to the court on the 18th (the day before yesterday) for strict investigation. Although there were many people present at the time, the crowd was agitated, and the situation was complex and difficult to prevent, the Municipal Government is seriously monitoring this case and is making every effort to investigate it, hoping that the truth will come to light and a fair resolution will be reached as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Firefighters</p>
<h3>Private Splitting of Iron Chests among Ashes</h3>
<p>Suspected of stealing items from the chest, prosecuted by the police and awaiting sentencing. Wanmao Dry Goods Store at 256 Guangxi Road suddenly caught fire from the upper floor at 6:45 a.m. the day before yesterday. The flames quickly engulfed the air, spreading to the neighboring stores of Dazhongyuan, Dalu, and Shengtai. Fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire with water hoses. The fire brigades then dispersed one after another. However, the firefighters from the Central District, wanting to eliminate the remaining embers, Zhou A'gen, Shi Wan'yi, Huang Zhengyuan, and three others ascended to the upper floor of Wanmao to inspect the situation after the other firefighters drove their wagons back. They then saw an iron chest in the room and their hearts couldn't help but be moved. Zhou A'gen then held a hatchet he was carrying and violently chopped at the lid of the chest, while Shi and Huang stood around the chest watching. However, the chest was made of iron and could not be opened in a short time. Wang Nake, the Western officer leading Zhou and others, had been waiting downstairs for a long time and still did not see Zhou and the others come down, so he also went upstairs to investigate. When he entered the room, Zhou was still working hard. The two officers knew that the fire brigade had strict orders prohibiting illegal actions by the firefighters, and Zhou and the others dared to violate them, which was extremely hateful. They immediately reprimanded them and led them back to the brigade, reporting to the leaders to search Zhou and the others thoroughly. No unknown objects were found, but their unwarranted splitting of the chest clearly indicated an intent to steal the contents of the chest, so they reported to the Laozha Police Station, requesting a strict investigation. The police chief sent detective Chen Jishan to the scene, arresting Zhou, Shi, and Huang and detaining them at the police station, and also went to Nanmao, where the fire started, to investigate. However, the owner and employees of the store had already fled without a trace. Yesterday morning, the police station filed a public lawsuit against Zhou and the others in the First Special District Local Court for theft under Article 338 of the Criminal Law. Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. First, attorney Gan Jingxian, representing the prosecution, stated the details of the case. Then, Wang Nake testified that he witnessed the defendant Zhou A'gen using a hatchet to chop at the lid of the chest, but it was not completely opened, while the two defendants Shi and Huang were peeking through the gaps in the chest at a few silver coins scattered on the floor. When questioned, the testimonies of the three defendants Shi, Huang, and Zhou were vague. After the interrogation, Judge Feng ordered the defendants to be returned to custody to await sentencing next Thursday. Intersection of North Fujian Road and Tiantong Road.</p>
<h3>Old House Collapse Kills and Injures People</h3>
<p>The floorboards and bricks collapsed quickly, and no one could escape. Eight people were found in the rubble, two dead and six severely injured. A house collapse that injured people occurred at the intersection of North Fujian Road and Tiantong Road yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Damp and Dark</h3>
<p>The buildings opposite each other in the area near the intersection of North Fujian Road and Tiantong Road in North Fujian Road are leased and built by the Laogongmao Foreign Firm. Up to now, it has been more than 30 years. Although the exterior is not very old, the interior and the building materials have been corroded and cannot bear. Therefore, every time it rains or floods, the buildings in the area become more humid and dark. Fortunately, repairs are made from time to time.</p>
<p>The North Fujian Road Collapse Situation (Qi Chang Photo)</p>
<p>This is somewhat勉bearable for a while. Unexpectedly, at around 1:38 p.m. yesterday, the building at No. 158 suddenly collapsed, killing and injuring eight people. The disaster was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Crackling Sounds</h3>
<p>No. 158 was Yuan Juxing Iron Shop, opened by Yuan Xiaogan, 63 years old, from Suzhou. His family lived upstairs, and because there were empty rooms, he rented it out to a couple named Wang A'chang. At around 1:25 p.m. yesterday, the beams and floorboards of the house suddenly crackled. At that time, everyone in the house thought it was caused by the wind, so they didn't pay attention and continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Overwhelming</h3>
<p>In less than a few minutes, everyone downstairs suddenly heard a loud noise upstairs, like an overwhelming force. They realized that something had happened and were waiting to escape, but the floorboards, bricks, and tiles had already fallen down with the momentum. Therefore, men, women, and children downstairs were unable to escape and were all buried in the rubble and sand. A pile. Xifeng Hotel, next door to the house, also had a wall partially collapsed. Neighbors and nearby police saw it and rushed to investigate, but there was no way to save them. The police urgently reported and the police station in charge dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the situation and disperse the idlers. They also notified the fire brigade to send ambulances to the scene to search for the men, women, and children who were buried. The traffic in that section was also temporarily blocked.</p>
<h3>Eight People Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>After several hours of work by the firefighters, a total of eight men, women, and children were found, including two people. One was Yuan Xiaogan's wife, Ma, 48 years old. The other was Wang A'chang's wife. Both were injured in the head and other important parts. They were rushed to Shanghai Nursing Home on Bazih Road and Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, they died in the hospital. There were still six people. One was Chen Yuying, 13 years old. One was Tang Xihe, 26 years old. Both were shop assistants and apprentices at the iron shop and Xifeng Hotel. The brain bones of the injured, broken ankle bones, are in critical condition. One was Wang Heshang, 9 years old, a boy, injured in the face. One was Wu Sanmao, 2 years old, a girl, sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment with a girl just two months old. It is reported that the three men, boys, and girls were all Wang A'chang's children. There was also Chen Zhu, who was slightly injured and sent to Renji Hospital. He was discharged after being bandaged. Afterwards, the police conducted a thorough investigation and reported it for verification.</p>

<h3>Wang Yingbin Discusses</h3>
<p>Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Zhejiang Construction Department and Director of the Propaganda Group of the Association, personally took care of matters in the exhibition. The reporter asked about the purpose of the association's launch. According to him, travel can increase the interest in life and the understanding of life. However, there are quite different methods and habits of travel entertainment between Chinese and Westerners. Westerners like to hunt, ride horses, fish, play ball games, and ice skating during travel. Chinese people rarely have these habits. If you are looking for like-minded people in travel, it is not easy to gather them. Our country is the oldest country with developed culture. Social habits have always valued literary and artistic production, or poetry and painting, as the only way to describe scenery and cultivate sentiment during travel. Moreover, my country's current famous scenic spots and summer resorts, such as Mogan Mountain and Kuanglu, were first developed by Westerners, and then Chinese people followed. It's very teeth-chilling for Westerners. From now on, Chinese people should have their own creative spirit. Such as Jinhua, Yandang, Tiantai, have successively established management bureaus to reorganize and develop, and stipulate that foreigners are not allowed to freely purchase property. The association is aimed at promoting the travel interest of Chinese people, and collecting literary and artistic works of young people, so it widely solicits works and sets award methods to encourage them.</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo</p>
<h3>Family Trouble</h3>
<p>One wife and three concubines are not enough, and he plans to take a young girl as a concubine. The legal wife sues for reconciliation and cohabitation.</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a spiritual troupe protagonist residing at No. 147, Ba Xian Fang, Huagenau Road, French Concession, a native of Shaoxing, is 42 years old this year. On November 28th, in the tenth year of the Republic of China, at Yipinxin Hotel in Hankou, he married a fellow villager, Xu Guizhen, through the introduction of a friend, Deng Xiaoqiu. Xu is 37 years old this year (according to Xu, she married a fellow villager, Feng Baosheng, at the age of sixteen, and divorced for some reason at the age of twenty-one). Since marrying Yi, she has given birth to a daughter named Sannan, who is eleven years old this year, and two adopted sons, one named A Liu, who is eight years old this year, and one named Jiudi, who is five years old this year. Since Yi moved to Shanghai, he has collaborated with Zhang Yeer to perform at the New New Garden in a comedy troupe and has gained quite a reputation. Later, he broke away from Zhang due to disagreements and established his own spiritual troupe. Who knew that Yi was a lecherous man, and successively in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he married a woman named Li Meizhen, also known as Yi's younger sister, who is 21 years old this year, as a concubine (Meizhen is the daughter of Guizhen's uncle). In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, he married a prostitute named Suzhou Yuanyuan, who is 23 years old this year, and changed her name to Yi Caitao. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, he married Dai Didi, who is 24 years old this year, and changed her name to Yi Didi as a concubine. With four concubines, they are always together, and perform hula dance and other comedy shows in various theaters. After marrying the three concubines, Yi treated his wife Xu as if she were an abandoned fan. In October of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Xu Guizhen was beaten and injured. Xu returned to her mother's home in Hangzhou and was treated for her nerves and injuries by Deng Yiqing, a doctor at Dafang Hotel in Shipailou, Hangzhou. Yi ignored all expenses. In the years of twenty-one, Guizhen hired lawyer Shen Erqiao in Hangzhou to send a letter to Yi Fangshuo, requesting alimony. Yi agreed to pay 15 yuan per month. On June 24th, Guizhen brought Jiudi to Shanghai, where Yi rented the back building of the Quancheng Rice Shop in Baxianfang and ate meals at the Zhang family in the front building. Until June of the twenty-second year, Yi began to order Guizhen to eat in his own home, at which time he cancelled the allowance and stated that Xu would be allocated two jiao for each party for other expenses. So they were at peace again. Unexpectedly, recently Yi Fangshuo had another strange idea. He wanted more and more, and wanted to marry Li Meizhen's younger sister, Li Xiaozhen, who is just thirteen years old. Guizhen resolutely disagreed, so another storm arose. Xu Guizhen left Yi's residence and temporarily resided at Cheng's house, No. 4, Yongqing Lane, Ailago Road. She filed a petition with the reconciliation court of the Second Special Court, requesting to live with Yi. The court approved the petition and summoned the other party yesterday morning at 11:30 am. It was reported that he had gone to Hankou, so he did not appear in court. The petitioner Xu Guizhen stated the previous situation and requested that Yi be brought to court. The court ordered that they be allowed to live together. Judge Li Liang advised that since the other party did not appear in court, he believed that the reconciliation was unsuccessful and ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed separately.</p>
<p>Zhang Laifu's Attempt to Find a Job Failed</p>
<h3>Suicide by Poisoning on the Bund</h3>
<p>A suicide note was found beside him, painfully explaining the reasons for the suicide. Zhang Laifu, 21 years old, from Haimen, used to be a partner at a certain cigarette shop in his hometown. Later, he was fired and came to Shanghai. He invested in a new Feng salary that was stolen by bandits in Puai Lane No. 20, Tiantong Road.</p>
<h3>One Thief Killed, One Thief Captured Alive</h3>
<p>Valiant Policeman Zhang Zhenxiang Risks All to Capture Thieves, Commendable</p>
<p>The Zhufeng Enamel Factory, located at No. 476 near Gujiawan Hengbang Bridge in Zhabei, with its distribution office at No. 228 Avenue Edward VII, has a practice of paying workers' salaries on the 5th and 20th of each month. The accounting director from Wuxing, Wang Naidong, 35 years old, and the paymaster from Taicang, Xiong Mengtao, 25 years old, would go to distribute the salaries. Yesterday was another pay day, so Wang and Xiong went to the Yuegong Automobile Company at No. 220 Avenue Edward VII around 1 PM to hire a taxi, No. 3067. They took the taxi to the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road to exchange for cash, obtaining 350 yuan in one-yuan bills, 900 yuan in five-yuan bills, and an additional 600 jiao in small silver coins. They then rode together to the factory. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the entrance of the Xifan Film Company between Shixing Road and Hengye Road in Zhabei, three bandits suddenly jumped out and blocked the way. One bandit pointed a pistol at the car and shouted for it to stop. The driver, seeing the situation, immediately stopped the car. Two bandits then jumped into the car and forced them to hand over the money. Wang and Xiong had no choice but to let them rob all 1,250 yuan in bills and 600 jiao in silver coins. After obtaining the money, the bandits got out of the car and tried to escape. Wang also immediately got out of the car to chase after them. Unexpectedly, he was watched by the bandit with the gun. Fortunately, a police officer on duty there learned of the situation and immediately reported it to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau. They immediately chased after the two bandits who were carrying the money. Liang Fuchu, the district chief of the Fifth District, upon hearing the report, immediately led Inspector Wang Zhizhang, Chief Police Officer Jiang Molin, Jiang Zhiqiang, Hu Youcheng, Patrol Police Zhang Wenhua, Wang Qifa, and Detective Team leaders You Hanwen and Lu Hexiang, along with detective Li Fei, to rush to the scene and pursue the bandits in separate directions. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits threw the money to the side of the road and fled wildly. As a result, Officer Zhang Zhenxiang bravely held onto one of the bandits who was carrying a gun. Although the bandit fired several shots, none hit him. Officer Zhang immediately seized the bandit's gun and fired back, hitting the bandit in a vital spot. He fell to the ground. At the same time, other police officers captured another bandit on Tongji Road. After being brought back to the district, the bandit confessed that his name was Liu Xuewen, 22 years old, from Yingren, living in a shed in Tanziwan. The bandit who was shot was named Zhang Wanfu, about 30 years old, from Yancheng. After District Chief Liang obtained the confession, he immediately telegraphed the Fire United Association to send a vehicle to transport the injured bandit to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died en route due to his serious injuries. The body will be examined this morning. The stolen goods have been returned to the owner. In the meantime, detective team members have been dispatched to continue pursuing the escaped bandit(s) for further investigation.</p>
<p>Temporarily residing at the residence of his uncle, Zhang Zhicheng, at No. 3, he sought a job to make a living. Unexpectedly, after several months, he found nothing, leading to extreme financial hardship. Overwhelmed by these thoughts, he became resentful and despondent. He decided to end his life, so he excused himself to return home and went out to purchase heavy opium. He ingested it on the way. When he reached the grassy area of the Bund near the Copper Man Pier, the poison had already entered his lungs. He immediately fainted and collapsed. Subsequently, Chinese Constable No. 21 from the General Patrol Station discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. After receiving the report, the patrol station instructed investigator Gao Yanrong to go to investigate. They found a suicide note on his person, addressed to his uncle, briefly stating that due to economic difficulties and the inability to find a way to make a living, he had resorted to this desperate measure. The investigator then went to the address to inform his uncle and transported the body to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body.</p>
<p>After examining the body, Zhang Zhicheng testified, stating that he was 57 years old and worked as a shop assistant at the Xingye Bank on Sichuan Road. The deceased was his nephew, Zhang Laifu, who was adopted as a son by the Cao family since he was young. He originally made a living in his hometown. Half a year ago, he came to him because he had nothing to do, asking him to help find a job. He had recommended him to [something] Zhen, and then gave him two yuan before the resignation. The day before yesterday, he claimed he would return home. I believed it was true, so I gave him two yuan as travel expenses and gave him several pieces of clothing. Unexpectedly, he would resort to such a measure. Now there is no one left in the Cao family. I request to claim the body. After hearing the testimony, Judge Guo ruled that the deceased, Zhang Laifu, a male, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his uncle, Zhang Zhicheng, to claim for burial after signing an affidavit.</p>

Wu, out of embarrassment and anger, suddenly pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Huang in the chest, causing internal injuries, excessive bleeding, and immediate death. The murderer was caught on the spot, along with the murder weapon, and taken to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Station and then to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning was the day of sentencing.

<p>The Small Loan Business of Tongyi is Thriving</p>
<h3>Due to People Preparing for Their Children's Education Expenses</h3>
<p>Tongyi Trust Company, located at No. 434 Beijing Road, has added small loans with installments for repayment, and in less than three months, the results have been remarkable. This is because the interest rate on small loans at the company is very low, and there is no investigation fee. This preferential treatment for small borrowers is not available at other financial institutions in the city that also offer small loans. Recently, major and minor schools in the city are recruiting new students, and fathers and elder brothers who rely on fixed income to maintain their livelihoods must prepare for their children's education expenses in advance, so many have been requesting loans from the company. Therefore, the loan officers in charge of the company have been quite busy these days.</p>

<p>Unable to Borrow New Clothes</p>
<h3>Sun Yuan's Daughter Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>The body was examined yesterday. Sun Yuan, from Hang County, Zhejiang, former chief prosecutor of the Ning County District Court in Zhejiang and judge of the First Special District Court in this city, is now practicing law in Shanghai at the age of 48. He lives with his wife, Hua Baobei, 43 years old, at No. 3 Nanmingde Lane, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Sun's daughter, Ai Qun, is studying in the junior high school at the Road Love Group Girls' School and will graduate this summer vacation. On the 18th of this month, a relative of Sun held a wedding at the Qingnian Association Hall. Ai Qun felt that her own clothes were not fashionable enough, so she borrowed a cheongsam from her elder sister of the same age, named Yu, to attend the wedding feast at the relative's house. Unexpectedly, her wish was not fulfilled, and she became unhappy. She suddenly had a short-sighted idea, found raw opium, and swallowed it in secret to commit suicide. When the poison took effect, her family discovered it and thought it was summer heatstroke. They immediately sent her to Baolong Hospital. After examination, the doctor realized it was poisoning and immediately performed an enema and stomach lavage. However, the opium poison had spread too deeply, and the treatment was ineffective. She died at 4:10 PM the next afternoon. The hospital reported it to the Xinzha Patrol Station, which then notified the French Patrol Station to send investigators to investigate. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang funeral home. Yesterday, the Second Special Court requested the Chief Prosecutor, along with forensic doctor Jiang and clerk Peng, to come to the funeral home to examine the body. It was determined that the body had indeed died from poisoning during her lifetime. The body was handed over to her biological father, Sun Yuan, for burial. After the examination, the patrol station took photos of the body, and then the family placed it in a coffin and temporarily stored it at the guild hall.</p>
<p>Worker at Maigen Road Train Station</p>
<h3>Has a Dispute with the Dahua Factory</h3>
<p>Workers Demand Management of All Loading at the Factory. The Railway Bureau is Currently Mediating to Prevent Escalation. The cargo depot at the Maigen Road Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is the central point for cargo transportation on the two lines. Recently, a conflict broke out between the railway loaders and unloaders there and the Dahua Paper Factory. The reporter from Shenshi News Agency learned the details from various parties yesterday after the Transportation Department made every effort to mediate:</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute: The Dahua Paper Factory is located near Maigen Road Station and has a good business. The production and sale of paper are all loaded and transported from this station. Before January 28, the factory's goods were all loaded and unloaded by the factory's own workers for convenience, with a fee of one jiao per piece. After January 28, because the railway handled responsible transportation, the railway workers demanded that Dahua hand over the loading and unloading to the railway workers and at the same time forced Dahua workers not to load and unload. Dahua refused because the railway department was responsible for transportation, which did not allow transportation companies to manage it. As for loading and unloading their own goods, there was no restriction. As a result, a sense of resentment arose between the workers on both sides, and there were repeated conflicts. After the railway police made every effort to suppress it, it temporarily subsided.</p>
<p>Mediation in Progress: After this incident occurred, Dahua handed over part of the loading and unloading work to railway workers. Recently, railway workers expressed dissatisfaction because Dahua Paper Factory still had a small part of the loading and unloading work done by its own workers. After receiving the news, the Transportation Department conducted a thorough investigation and paid close attention to the matter. Since the company loaded and unloaded its own goods, there was no explicit prohibition from the railway department. The workers had no reason to demand loading and unloading from Dahua Paper Factory. Yesterday afternoon, the foreman and more than ten other workers at Maigen Road Station were summoned for persuasion and were told that they should not engage in the above behavior again. At the same time, the Transportation Department is discussing with Dahua Paper Factory to have railway workers load and unload the goods within the possible range in order to avoid major misunderstandings between the two sides. It is expected that a storm may temporarily subside. Xiao Weiguo Discusses: According to Xiao Weiguo, director of the Transportation Department of the two lines, he told the reporter from Shenshi News Agency that he felt very sad about the occurrence of the unfortunate incident. Because railway workers have no understanding of the matter and are manipulated by a small number of people, it has led to a storm. The department has started to mediate on this matter and can come to an end in the near future. At the same time, a permanent and appropriate solution is sought so that railway transportation is not affected.</p>
<h3>Fire at Lujiazidu, Pudong, Yesterday</h3>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out in a flat in the back of the Shenchang small cigarette and paper shop at the north end of Gaomu Bridge, Lujiazidu, Pudong, at around 4 PM yesterday afternoon.

The police on duty sounded the alarm whistle, and the Pudong District Fire Brigade quickly drove the pump truck to the scene to put out the fire. District Chief Zhang of the Third District and Captain Wu of the Fourth Brigade of the Security Corps also led the police and corps to the scene to suppress [things]. Fortunately, the river water was high, so the fire was extinguished by the firefighters after burning for half an hour. A total of two flat houses were destroyed. Although the Shenchang shop was not burned down, most of its property was destroyed. Afterwards, the fire starter, Sun Alin, and the owner of the Shenchang shop, Wu Yin, were taken to the district for questioning.</p>

<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Fellow Tradesmen in Cooked Water Organize Office</h3>
<p>There are approximately 200 cooked water shops in the French Concession.

The purpose is to solidify fellow tradesmen and develop business.

<h3>On Literary Theory (Continued)</h3>
<p>Answering Zhou Yun-jun, Pan's Literary Theory is naturally not a perfect book. Because it is compiled from several of the author's lecture notes and fragmentary articles on literature, it is not a systematic work. Therefore, in terms of compilation, it is too disorganized, and in terms of editing, it is too cumbersome. Moreover, as a book on literary theory, the content is not substantial enough. For example, the origin of literature and creative methods are major topics that every literary theory book should touch upon. However, here, regarding the origin of literature, only a brief mention is made in the first lecture, the so-called impulse theory, without expanding on the issue. As for creative methods, they are only mentioned briefly in the appendix, in the article "How to Study Literature." However, we believe that these shortcomings are not enough to make Zhou feel scared and confused.</p>
<p>The author's understanding of literature, as we see it now, is not entirely correct. He belongs to the school of art for life. He believes that literature is "the expression of the self" and "the self-awareness of man." The elements of literature are personal emotions and imagination, with thought being closely related to emotions. He agrees with Taine's claim that literature is produced by environment, race, and time. However, Taine's claim has long been refuted by Plekhanov, because Taine did not see the decisive role of social classes. The so-called environment and race exert their corresponding influence under the control of social classes. Literature is not "the expression of the self" but "the reflection of social life," not "the self-awareness of one person" but "the self-awareness of a social class." Mr. Pan sees "life" in literature but does not see the society that determines life, thus creating the main flaw in the book's viewpoint.</p>
<p>Despite this, through this book, we believe that the author is not simply copying and piecing together other people's different opinions but has his own consistent argument. The two sentences, "Literature is the pursuit of a perfect life" and "Literature is the expression of pure emotions of life in the form of words," can represent the author's entire opinion. I believe that Zhou's confusion is because Zhou did not read his article clearly. (As mentioned earlier, because the editing is not good, it is not easy to see the main point of the article.) Zhou consecutively cited more than a dozen sentences like "Literature is..." thinking that these would confuse people. In fact, some of these sentences are only explanations of the main points, while others are intentionally citing opposing opinions to prove the truth of his own argument. If Zhou reads each sentence carefully in the context of the preceding and following text, he will definitely not be confused. For example, the sentence cited by Zhou, "Simply expressing well is also a literary work," is clearly intended to lead to the following sentence, "But it does not mention the entirety of literature" (page 37 of the original book). Also, when Zhou sees, "Emotion is subjective, and without personality, only three things – environment, race, and time – can never produce emotions" (see page 19 of the original book), if he reads the following paragraph, he will not doubt that Mr. Pan strongly supports Taine and advocates personality. As for the so-called "classical school," "romantic school," and "naturalist school," they are explanations of the changes in literature, explanations that one era has its own literature. Literature is not a dead thing but develops with the development of society. The new realism is now popular because the current era and society have objective reasons for producing new realism. It is impossible to throw oneself into the inflatedness of the classical and romantic schools of the old era. So how could this confuse Zhou? When Zhou reads, he should never look for chapters and verses, or quibble over words. He should read calmly sentence by sentence to see what the main idea expressed in the article is. The book lists many books on philosophy and social sciences, which makes Zhou feel scared, also Zhou's misunderstanding. As mentioned earlier, literary theory is to give beginners a concept of literature and point out a way of research. It is very necessary for a book on literary theory to introduce to readers books that are closely related to the study of literature, but it does not limit that anyone who reads literary theory must read the books that are introduced. It all depends: if Zhou wants to have a deep understanding of literature, he must read according to the introduced bibliography; (Gorky, who Zhou cited, although he was a vagrant, also worked hard at learning.) If Zhou only seeks to have a concept of literature, then he can ignore how complicated the introduced bibliography is. Moreover, although reading must be limited by our economic time, we feel that it is not a sufficient reason to use the limitation of economic time as a reason not to read. We should strive for the right to read from an extremely difficult environment. We hope that Zhou does not have this kind of fearful psychology.</p>
<p>In short, Pan's Literary Theory has shortcomings. However, as Zhou said, Zhou himself should be largely responsible for feeling confused and scared.</p>
<p>Currently, there are not many books on literary theory that are perfect and readable. The New Literary Theory published by Kaiming Bookstore, although rich in content, is unsound in viewpoint and eclectic, without any opinion of its own, and is really not suitable for beginners to read. There is nothing else worth taking. We believe that if Zhou needs to read a better theory book again, Dai Shuqing's A Brief Theory of Literary Principles, although simple, is still a more readable book for beginners. (The end)</p>

<p>The foreign masters are really powerful, and they are trying every means to promote their aggression. In academics and commercial advertising, they are promoting the "legitimacy" of their aggression.</p>
<p>In old anthropology and linguistics, their aggressive "ideology" is revealed. That has been negated by new anthropologists and linguists. The foreign masters are reviving the glazed tile and vermilion railings of China's feudal buildings, implying that some Chinese people are retreating backward.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a prize-winning advertisement from a certain soap company that was soliciting an answer, but the meaning inside was not very simple. The topic is called "Black and White Crossing the River."</p>
<p>The "Black and White Crossing the River" is roughly like this. Between Brown Village and Olive Village is a river. Three white people and three black people want to cross from Brown Village to Olive Village, but there is only one small boat in the river, which can only seat two people. Only three white people and one small black person can row the boat. Moreover, the number of black people who cross to Olive Village or stay in Brown Village must not exceed the number of white people, because all three black people are cannibals and will eat white people.</p>
<p>This arithmetic problem is very interesting. I think some people, especially women and children, will definitely study it with relish. And you can get rich, which is even more suitable for our money-grubbing ideology. There must be many people who study and apply, but unknowingly, some people will definitely believe that black people really eat white people. As a result, the foreign masters' great achievement is completed.</p>
<p>In fact, who is the cannibal? Is it the black people? Or the white people? I have only heard of black slaves, but I have never heard of white slaves. In fact, it would be more appropriate to switch the black and white people in "Black and White Crossing the River."</p>
<p>Everyone is a cannibal. The aggressors are a certain group of people.</p>
<p>Aggressors are good at spreading rumors. According to a friend who returned from France, there is a charity donation box for saving Chinese children hanging in French churches. They said that Chinese children are suffering and need them to save them, but what is the reason? They said that Chinese people use children to feed pigs. If they are not saved, they will be fed up quickly. But, is there such a thing as using children to feed pigs in China? God knows! Behind charity is the existence of a legitimate reason for aggression.</p>
<p>We must resist aggressors. We must be more careful at all times to guard against the germs they spread.</p>
<h3>On the Sex Life of Students</h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>If a young person imagines marriage when they are in love, I believe their imagination will definitely be shattered.</p>
<p>If a young person cannot understand marriage and love separately, then on the day of love failure, they will taste the pain of love failure, and on the day of love success, they will taste the pain of marriage failure!</p>
<p>Most reasons for love suicide and divorce lie here.</p>
<p>Love is like visiting a flower garden, while marriage is like tending a flower garden; love is like appreciating a beautiful flower, while marriage is like cultivating a beautiful flower!</p>
<p>When in love, everyone dresses themselves up, and once a week they accompany their lovers to the cinema, to the park, to the mountains, and to swim. This is interesting, but if you think that after marriage, these things will be easier to do, and more freely and interestingly done, then you are fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>Love is flowering, and marriage is bearing fruit. The two are two different things, but at the same time, they are one thing. If you look at them too much as two different things, you will see marriage as mechanical and forced; if you look at them too much as one thing, you will misunderstand the meaning of marriage.</p>
<p>Marriage is ending yourself and preparing for the life of your children, and you must take care of your children's happiness, otherwise, you must divorce.</p>
<p>Chinese intellectual youth have too long a time in love and marry too late, so they only enjoy the sweetness of love and cannot bear the shackles of marriage.</p>
<p>Love is romantic, and marriage is realistic.</p>
<p>Love can transcend reality, and marriage can touch reality.</p>
<p>Love is like wine, and marriage is like rice. If you drink too much wine, you can't swallow rice.</p>
<p>Marriage is an organization, a training, and a construction. The love of marriage is not a deepening of love, not just an increase in quantity, but a change in quality.</p>
<p>If we want to bring Chinese intellectual youth into line, early marriage may be a solution. One should get married after graduating from high school! Of course, for the sake of business in parks and cinemas, you shouldn't advocate this, but if entertainment belongs to people, not people to entertainment, then marriage can bring entertainment into the correct meaning.</p>
<p>I hate those people who don't go to the cinema to watch movies, and don't go to the park to walk!</p>
<p>Those who advocate late marriage should first make young people "fall in love late," like the school spirit in Swiss universities, which is the fundamental solution. Chinese young people who start falling in love at fifteen or sixteen years old, asking them to marry at thirty years old will make their temperament frivolous, romantic, and irresponsible during such a long period of love, and their studies will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>In universities, girls dress up like flowers, and boys are as busy as bees; a university is often like a garden and a beehive. Names like "Flower King" and "Queen" are ultimately products of gardens and beehives.</p>
<p>University students only know how to transcend the real society; not only can they not enter society, but they do not even have the ability to organize two people into a family; they simply do not know how to organize, do not know how to budget; they do not know how to use their hands, but only know how to use their five senses. They can buy candy for their lovers and buy tickets to cinemas and parks, but they do not have the ability to open a slightly troublesome bill and buy everything item by item.</p>
<p>Therefore, China has few contributions in science and few great works in literature; in politics, there is only activity but no unity and no parties outside the party!</p>
<p>You can see on Sundays and slightly longer holidays that all university students are spending their time in cinemas and parks, and few can make longer trips or climb a higher peak to reach a famous mountain range.</p>
<p>University students, the girls who come out are all stars, and the boys who come out are all supporting actors! I am too tired of seeing it! Many old people say that in the past, women served their husbands to study, but now women only know how to accompany men to play! I think early marriage is beneficial. This is not to ask our stars to accompany men to study, but in fact, supporting actors should also accompany girls to study. - After all, you are all people who have books to read!</p>
<p>Yes, too few female students in universities is also a reason for youth unrest; many organizations, it is no secret, are created to attract female students, but you must know that love and marriage are different, and a person having a lover and a person having a wife are different. This is by no means a definitive advocacy of monogamy, but simply to say that if these university students are not stable in their sex lives, it is really too unsightly - groups, like female dogs in springtime!</p>
<p>Some people also talk about the cost of money, which is really a matter worth reporting. The "tuition fee" of a university student during the love period is enough to provide the "tuition fee" for a middle school student who is unable to go to university. Those who do not believe it can investigate, and if the investigation is correct, they can contribute to the government. It is really necessary to levy a love tax!</p>
<p>Those who are already in love should only get married when they graduate from middle school, and only enter society when they graduate from university!</p>
<p>Is it falling into the old cliché of cultivating oneself, ordering one's family, governing one's state, and pacifying the world?</p>
<h3>Summer Travel</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>"Sea breeze, cicada song, the sun of June."</p>
<p>A friend living in Wusong wrote these enticing words, and we began our first trip of the summer.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to walk in the wind on the embankment, and it is also very pleasant to tread through the muddy and dusty village roads, because people seem to have gained a great liberation by escaping from the environment of only seeing roof tiles and brick walls.</p>
<p>Sitting in a thatched shop selling soda water, looking at the sea, the sky, and the fields, people feel like they have become children of nature, lying in its embrace. The sea breeze blows loudly, and I want to fall asleep on the rattan chair, although the words we speak are constantly flowing out between our lips with the childlike energy that makes people not easily tired.</p>
<p>Next to the rattan table, on the muddy ground, small crabs crawl quietly. We do not catch them, nor do we make a sound to startle them, but we watch them with a smile, letting them be free.</p>
<p>Going to the village restaurant, passing by a pond full of reeds, we feel that in our slow footsteps, there should be two or three wild ducks suddenly startled and flying up. Although the result was that there was not a single wild duck, it reminded us of those scenes of hunting wild ducks written by Turgenev in "A Sportsman's Sketches." Therefore, our casual conversation under the sunlight took the boat of "A Sportsman's Sketches" and sailed to the ocean of novels.</p>
<h3>Hot in Nanjing (IV)</h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>As for the various entertainment venues, they are still crowded and full, and business has not decreased slightly due to the bizarre drought and heat. The human flesh market is only particularly unlucky for the poor and lowly people, who are caught by the police in hundreds like stray dogs and punished. Perhaps it is because the charm of flesh is particularly strong in this summer, which makes people feel scared, so the municipal authorities suddenly strictly prohibited various song and dance troupes from coming to Nanjing to perform. Among them, the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe, which made a comeback, was considered to have touched the jackpot. However, at the same time, it was reported in the newspaper that this was only the boss suffering a little loss, and the actresses did not feel lonely. Every day at dusk, look at the scenery in front of the Confucius Temple and on Taiping Road. Under the flashing of the red and green neon lights, the bustling young men and women show a kind of foxtrot posture, which is more numerous and beautiful than at any time. Especially those radio phonographs emit rustling sounds, interspersed with the chirping of car horns, the clattering of horse-drawn carriages, and the shouts of rickshaw pullers, the hawking sounds of shoulder-carrying vendors, and the begging sounds of those kneeling along the way... There are also bursts of silk and bamboo gongs and drums floating in the wind, and the high singing and low chanting of young girls, which together form a kind of urban symphony, loud and full of ears, uninterrupted at all times, simply as noisy as the cicadas chirping in the daytime.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Those who still have to work hard as usual tomorrow all drag their mats out to sleep outdoors early. So just looking at men, women, old, and young, all you see are people with their heads facing south and their feet facing north, snoring like thunder. Driven by their selfish and self-interested hearts, they often block the sidewalks or narrow streets and alleys, and do not ask whether it is easy for people to walk. But there are police officers who care about traffic, hygiene, and appearance, so they often run to interfere, not allowing them to block the road and be shirtless. If they dare to resist, they will be invited to sit in the police station. But the police are also very understanding of the hard work of the general public, and they feel that their sweet dreams should not be broken, so they ordered small food vendors selling food late at night not to shout loudly or shake their bells. However, why don't those small vendors sleep late at night, but come out to disturb people? ······</p>
<p>Probably poor people are not afraid of heat, so there is no need for cooling facilities for the poor here. The water in Nanjing is not like Suzhou, where each load sells for one yuan, so they can drink to their heart's content at the tea tanks set up by various philanthropists along the street. As for Tokyo, where grand cooling parties are often held in Hibiya and other parks in the summer for the enjoyment of the general public, this is something that the citizens of Nanjing cannot even dream of.</p>
<p>Finally, what must be said is that although the lives of the poor are not worth much, and not enough to invite the attention of the adults and gentlemen, but because they account for about 70% of the population living together in the city, once they develop some kind of disease and spread it throughout the city, can the wealthy families really be completely exempt? (The end)</p>
<h3>I Come from the East (IV)</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>It has been half a year since the reporter saw the Centennial Progress Exhibition last September and did not see Chicago. This time when I came here again, the bad images of half a year ago ran into my heart again. On a drizzly morning, the car drove into the southern part of this big city; although many shops and factories were not yet open, I could hear this city full of sin already beginning its buzzing sound. Slaughterhouses, hooligans, machine guns, assassinations, kidnappings, prostitution, drunkenness, extortion, roulette, corruption, cruelty, hatred between races, and envy between classes, all of these are beginning their daily performances again.</p>
<p>Last year, I stayed at the Darden Hotel and was disturbed by the Chicago trams for several days and could not sleep well. Now I still have anger towards these trams. Chicago's elevated trains always run over the heads of pedestrians. Sometimes, over a person's head and feet, there are trams full of passengers passing by very noisily and quickly. The tram tracks are covered with yellow rust, and the dozens of large buildings blackened by the coal smoke along the road form an ugly picture of a big city.</p>
<p>At a corner of Michigan Avenue, two towering buildings stand tall. One is the Wrigley Company, which made a fortune by selling chewing gum, and the other is the newspaper office of the Chicago Tribune, which sells 800,000 to 900,000 copies every day. The owners of these two companies (Wrigley is dead) are the most powerful wealthy people in Chicago; and the position of these two buildings in the city of Chicago is very similar to Sincere and Wing On in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chicago is a city dominated by the wealthy on one hand, but most of Chicago's life is in the hands of hooligans. Brothels, dance halls, gambling dens, taverns, nightclubs, and many other vulgar entertainment venues are all opened by hooligans. They not only run businesses that create social ills themselves, but also destroy the legitimate businesses of society. Almost all Chicago small business owners have to pay a certain tribute to the hooligans every month, otherwise, they will burn your house and kill your people. For example, laundry shops and barbershops have hooligans who come to collect tribute on a regular basis. Last year, a gang of hooligans appeared that specialized in breaking glass windows. If you open a shop in Chicago, and if there are several large glass windows in your shop, you have to pay a fee to this gang of hooligans every month. If the fee is not paid, they will come and smash your glass windows to pieces in broad daylight.</p>
<p>The hooligans in Chicago are equipped with bombs, machine guns, and many of the latest killing tools. Often in their headquarters, there are very complete armories built. Their leaders often have millions or tens of millions of fortunes. Their organization is very strict. Their command is very sensitive. The business they used to do was mainly selling private liquor. Now the profit from selling private liquor is relatively small due to the opening of the liquor ban. Therefore, the bulk of their income relies on kidnapping and robbing banks. In the past year, in the several provinces near Chicago, I don't know how many lives and properties were sacrificed in the hands of these hooligans.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Directives for Colleges and Above</h3>
<p>Key Points for Improvement in Various Schools (V)</p>
<h3>Jinan Private Qilu University</h3>
<p>The school's academic atmosphere is good, and the medical school has made considerable contributions. The research papers of the science school are able to focus on domestic issues, which is commendable. The key points for improvement are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The physiology department of the medical school should find ways to add more physiological instruments, the organization department more embryonic specimens, and the bacteriology department more research materials. The treatment room of the affiliated hospital also needs to increase equipment. The pharmacy vocational school should be renamed as a pharmacy specialty course. The college should raise funds to determine expenses and seek further progress.</p>
<p>(2) The astronomy and mathematics department of the science school should add courses on astronomy. The wireless radio specialty course should add telephone and automatic telephone courses. The library should add complete sets of specialized magazines.</p>
<p>(3) The history and politics department and the social economics department of the liberal arts school, it is said that the school plans to change them into history and sociology department and political economics department respectively, which should be implemented immediately. The education department should stop enrolling students starting this year and end it year by year. The remaining funds should be used to enrich the equipment of other departments. The education courses can still be taught selectively.</p>
<p>(4) Morning assembly is held six times a week, which is too many. It is proposed to reduce it appropriately.</p>
<h3>Jinan Shandong Provincial Medical Specialty School</h3>
<p>This school is still able to adapt to local needs. The faculty and staff are diligent in their teaching and work, and the students are also hardworking, which is commendable. Here are the key points that the school should improve, specially noted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Funding: According to the school's report in July of last year, the recurring expenses for the 21st year of the Republic of China were 80,460 yuan. Now, according to the report, the recurring expenses for the school in the 22nd year of the Republic of China are 54,870 yuan, less than two-thirds of the original amount. It was previously reported that the school received temporary funds each year for increasing the number of classes, which was merely a workaround. It is urgent to raise more funds to strengthen the foundation. Furthermore, the school's allocation of funds shows that equipment expenses account for only 4%, which does not meet the standards set by the ministry. Efforts should be made to increase it.</p>
<p>(2) School Buildings and Equipment: The school buildings were originally very narrow. Now that the Shandong Provincial Department has allocated all the buildings of the Shandong University Factory Management Office, they should be properly allocated and used as soon as possible. The school's equipment is rudimentary. The contents of the laboratories, anatomy rooms, etc., should be urgently enriched. The inpatient section of the affiliated hospital should also be expanded to provide students with sufficient clinical practice opportunities.</p>
<p>(3) Faculty and Curriculum: The salary of part-time teachers should not exceed the average hourly rate of full-time teachers. The teaching hours of full-time teachers should also be regulated, neither too many nor too few. German instruction should be increased. Only one of English or Japanese should be chosen as a foreign language, and the teaching time should be increased.</p>
<h3>Kaifeng Henan University</h3>
<p>The school has limited funding and many departments, resulting in mediocrity and difficulty in achieving significant results. It should immediately follow the points listed below and vigorously implement improvements:</p>
<p>(1) The Department of Civil Engineering in the College of Science has rudimentary equipment and should be abolished immediately. The school should decide on transfer arrangements for the existing students. The Department of Biology should continue to suspend enrollment. The decision on whether to abolish it should be re-evaluated based on whether the faculty and equipment can be enriched.</p>
<p>(2) College of Liberal Arts: 1. The Department of Sociology should continue to be closed as previously ordered and should not enroll new students. 2. The Department of Chinese Literature and the Department of History should be merged into a Department of Literature and History, but students in the third and fourth grades of each department may continue to be managed according to the original classes. 3. The Department of English may continue to enroll students if the faculty is sufficient. (3) Except for the Department of Economics, the College of Law should not enroll new students. After the existing students of the Department of Law and the Department of Political Science have completed their studies, the Department of Economics should be merged into the College of Liberal Arts. For the items mentioned in items 2 and 3, enrollment should be stopped for the departments mentioned, and efforts should be made to transfer or audit the existing students of each department to close them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) The bacteriology laboratory and pharmacology laboratory of the College of Medicine should be built as soon as possible. Materials for the bacteriology laboratory and equipment for the physiology and biochemistry laboratory must be added. The consultation rooms and treatment rooms of the affiliated hospital must also be expanded.</p>
<p>(5) The school's administrative expenses are too high, and the equipment expenses are too low. Moreover, income and expenditure cannot offset each other, which is inappropriate. Expenditures should be economized to achieve a balanced budget. Administrative expenses should be substantially reduced, and equipment expenses should be increased to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>(6) The number of staff members at the school is too large and should be substantially reduced. The number of teachers should be reduced, strict standards should be set, and hiring should be done carefully.</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Specialty School</h3>
<p>The key points that the school should improve are specially noted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Organization and Curriculum: The affiliated high school of the school has already been ordered to be changed to a senior vocational school. As for the standards of the specialized courses, they are high, but the teaching materials are too crowded and burdensome. They should be carefully selected and redefined to suit the students' learning abilities. If the curriculum cannot be easily allocated due to the limited two-year study period, the study period should be immediately increased to three years.</p>
<p>(2) Funding and Equipment: The school's budget for this year is listed as 43,843 yuan, which is severely lacking. The equipment is also rudimentary. Funding should be increased immediately and equipment expanded to strengthen the foundation.</p>
<p>(3) Teacher Qualifications and Treatment: The school lacks water conservancy engineering experts. Efforts should be made to recruit them. Teacher salaries are too low, and there are too few full-time teachers. All of these issues must be seriously improved.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, the school should actively improve them, and examine the opinions put forward in the original report, which include three items. In addition to emphasizing the third improvement method, the first method involves cooperation between several provinces, and the plan is still comprehensive. The second method is to avoid duplication of departments and financial dispersion, which is also correct. These two methods should be handled by the Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Jinan University</h3>
<p>It has been found that the school's recent management has not been good, and the accumulated problems are very deep. The Ministry has repeatedly urged improvement, but with little effect. Since the turmoil occurred last year, discipline has been completely lost. In order to reorganize higher education for overseas Chinese, the Ministry has repeatedly sent personnel to the school for close inspection. It is believed that in the past six months, there has been no progress in teaching, moral education, subject organization, school administration, or other aspects. The school is now given another opportunity to make every effort to rectify the situation. The points that should be improved are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Define the Teaching Objectives: The school's teaching objectives should focus on the following three points in the future:</p>
<p>1. Training teachers for overseas Chinese schools in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>2. Cultivating overseas commercial talents.</p>
<p>3. Investigating and researching the customs, products, economics, and practical education of Southeast Asia. (2) Reorganize Departments: The school's existing departments should be reorganized according to the above principles as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Department of Banking and Accounting in the College of Commerce should be appropriately reduced or merged into one department. The Department of Railway Management should be cancelled. Efforts should be made to enrich the Department of International Trade, focusing on the research of Southeast Asian trade.</p>
<p>2. The Department of Foreign Languages in the College of Liberal Arts should also pay attention to the research of languages in Southeast Asia. The Department of History and Geography should also focus on the research of Southeast Asian history and geography. Students in the Department of Education should study some credits in the College of Liberal Arts or the College of Science.</p>
<p>3. The Department of Mathematics and the Department of Physics in the College of Science should be merged into a Department of Mathematics and Physics. The Department of Chemistry remains the same.</p>
<p>(3) Limit Enrollment: In the future, at least one-third of the new students enrolled in each college of the university should be children of overseas Chinese. The enrollment of new students this year should be strictly examined, and the number of admissions should be appropriately reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly Implement the Full-Time System: The Secretary-General, Dean of Academic Affairs, Deans of each college, and Heads of each department of the university should all be full-time positions and should not hold positions outside the school. More full-time teachers should be hired. The number of part-time courses taken by full-time professors should be limited. The number of part-time teachers should not exceed one-third of the total number. The salary standards for full-time professors should be appropriately increased.</p>
<p>(5) Reduce Staffing: 1. The Director of the Overseas Cultural Affairs Department should be held concurrently by a professor. The other research expenses and staff of the department should be limited to five to seven people. 2. The Sports Committee should be cancelled, and a director and instructor should be appointed, with a maximum of three people. 3. In addition to one full-time standing committee member, the other members of the Moral Education Committee should be held concurrently by college deans and professors. The dormitory manager and other staff of the committee should not exceed seven people. 4. The Health Department should be cancelled, and health matters should be handled by the school clinic. The number of school doctors and school clinic staff should be reduced by half. 5. The library staff should not exceed ten people. 6. In addition to the instructors and teaching assistants, the staff of the military instructor's office should be reduced by at least half. 7. The staff of other departments should be eliminated as much as possible. The Secretariat should not exceed fifteen people, and the Academic Affairs Office should not exceed nine people. The printing group should be cancelled, and its affairs should be handled by the General Affairs Section, without additional staff. 8. The number of teaching assistants in each college and department should be reduced separately. 9. In addition to reducing staffing, all office expenses should be tightened.</p>
<p>(6) Rectify School Discipline: From now on, school regulations must be strictly enforced for all students to correct the undesirable academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>(7) Reorganization of the Middle School Department: 1. The middle school buildings should be separated from the university as soon as possible to facilitate management and training. 2. The middle school should only enroll overseas Chinese students. 3. The number of middle school faculty and staff should be reduced as much as possible by the school, with full-time positions as the principle. Part-time teaching by full-time faculty and staff must be restricted.</p>

<h3>Appeal to the Government Again</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Beiping Workers' Movement Petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education Again (Nanjing, 20th Dispatch) Representatives of the Beiping Student Workers' Movement Alliance petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 20th. Wang Shijie personally met with them and agreed to submit the matter to the Executive Yuan for research. The representatives were satisfied. They then went to the Executive Yuan, where Chu Minyi met with them on behalf of the President and agreed to forward the petition to President Wang for review.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation Discusses</p>
<h3>Revising Textbooks in Various Countries</h3>
<p>The issue of eliminating war in spirit is one of the most difficult (Havas Agency, Geneva, 19th Dispatch) The League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation held a meeting chaired by the British representative Murray to discuss revising textbooks in various countries to eliminate the issue of war in spirit. This is one of the most difficult things. The national branches of the committee have listed and sent the textbooks used in various countries to Geneva for publication by the League of Nations. However, due to the unfavorable international political situation, it has not been possible to use this material to take formal action internationally. The purpose of the committee is not only to delete the words in the textbooks that hinder good international understanding, but also to make the compilation of textbooks based on the spirit of international harmony. This is the opinion of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee has asked the Paris Institute of Intellectual Cooperation to review the textbooks of various countries and adopt those that have an objective spirit and do not make subjective ideas, compile them into books, and widely disseminate them, so that the tasks undertaken by the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation can have a more concrete foundation.</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, Geneva, 18th Dispatch) The League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation continued its meeting today to discuss the cooperation between the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation and the Chinese government to reform Chinese education. The education expert Morehead, who was sent to China by the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, reported on the course of the mission to China. Professor Lang Zhiwan (one of the four experts who came to China to study Chinese professors in 1931 at the invitation of the Chinese government) made supplementary explanations. According to the Chinese government, in December 1933, it requested the Secretariat of the League of Nations to send qualified personnel to Nanjing to study the implementation methods of the recommendations jointly drafted by the educational inspection team sent to China in 1931 and the Chinese educational inspection team that went to Europe the following year.</p>
<p>Wang Shijie, Minister of Education of China, expressed in this request that he hoped that the League of Nations would send a liaison expert to China to undertake the following duties: (1) Prepare technical research for Chinese educators and the Chinese educational inspection team to Europe.</p>
<p>(2) Prepare for the study and implementation of several reform programs that are specifically related to Chinese education.</p>
<p>(3) Draft recommendations to guide Chinese students studying abroad.</p>
<p>The Committee on Intellectual Cooperation sent Morehead, Deputy Director of the International Labor Bureau, to undertake this mission. After Morehead arrived in China, he repeatedly consulted with Chinese officials, cabinet members, the Intellectual Cooperation Committee, the chairman and members of the Chinese branch, and the authorities of various universities and schools. It is believed that the Chinese government's desire is to bring education under the state and seek the reform of technical education from a practical point of view. Morehead made several suggestions during this trip to China.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy of these is the establishment of a vocational introduction office for Chinese intellectual workers, which is organized and managed by a committee composed of personnel from the Ministries of Education, Industry, Internal Affairs, Railways, and Communications. This vocational introduction office is responsible for conducting a general and complete investigation of the various intellectual workers urgently needed and available in various provinces. At the same time, it seeks out intellectual workers in various places, and all those who can stand alone or can take on a part should be included. In addition, the vocational introduction office is also responsible for guiding Chinese students or university graduate students studying abroad. This introduction office should establish an agency in Geneva and be assisted by Morehead.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Will Open</p>
<h3>Private Specialty School Subsidy Review Meeting</h3>

<h3>Jointly Preparing to Send Off Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Yesterday, letters were sent to various educational organizations to solicit joint sponsorship. The date for sending off students studying abroad this year has been decided. The General Assembly for Sending Off Students Studying Abroad this year has been jointly prepared by the Global Chinese Student Association and the Municipal Education Bureau. Yesterday, letters were specially sent to various educational organizations and universities in this city to solicit joint sponsorship. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Letter to Various Organizations to Jointly Sponsor</h3>
<p>The Global Chinese Student Association and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau jointly sent letters to various educational organizations and universities in this city yesterday to solicit joint sponsorship. The original letter is as follows: Most of the students going to Europe and the United States this year are scheduled to leave in mid-August. Our bureau and others are launching preparations to hold a send-off meeting. We would like to invite your office to jointly sponsor it. If you agree, please reply immediately and indicate the names of the representatives you have designated for contact. This is what we hope for. The preparation office is located at the Global Chinese Student Association, 191 Carter Road.</p>
<h3>Students Studying Abroad Scheduled to Depart</h3>
<p>Most of the students going abroad this year have their departure procedures handled by the Global Student Association. As of yesterday, there were already more than 100 people, mostly going to the United States to study science and engineering, followed by England, Germany, and France. They are divided into two batches to depart. The first batch is scheduled to depart on the Hoover President on August 14. The report that the Hoover was rescheduled to set sail on the 10th is inaccurate. The second batch is scheduled to depart on the Grant President on August 21.</p>
<h3>Publicly Funded Students Prepare Quickly</h3>
<p>According to Wu Deyin, from the Study Abroad Reception Department of the Global Student Association, the Ministry of Education has limited the publicly funded students from the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan to go abroad within three months from July 10. Therefore, many people have come to entrust us with handling the departure procedures. However, there are still some people whose departure procedures have not been completed so far, and the time is very short. Because the American universities will start in mid-September, if all the procedures cannot be completed by August, they will inevitably not be able to enroll. Therefore, it is hoped that the publicly funded students will prepare quickly or go to the association nearby to handle it.</p>
<p>Five Organizations Jointly Organize</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Summer Children's Health Camp</h3>
<p>Daily life is hygienic and disciplined, and weight checks show an average increase of one pound. The Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp is jointly organized by the Children's Morning Post, the Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association, the Children's Welfare Association, the Health Bureau, and the Education Bureau. The purpose is to implement health education during the holidays so that children with poor physical and mental health can regain their health. The camp is located in the middle school department of Tongji University in the Wusong District, with a very good environment. The camp opened on the 6th of this month. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau, and Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, personally went to guide. Since the opening of the camp, visitors have been coming in an endless stream. Here are the recent developments, selected and recorded below:</p>
<h3>Physical and Mental Examination</h3>
<p>The children in the camp must undergo morning checks and temperature measurements twice a day, morning and evening. Their weight is also measured every week. The results are good, with an average weight gain of one pound per person. Stool tests are performed to look for parasites in the intestines. Psychological hygiene was also carried out last Saturday. It is important to note that in childhood, cases of neurosis and even suicide caused by fear and ridicule are not uncommon. The camp pays special attention to this. Currently, two children with stuttering and one child with loneliness have been found, and efforts have been made to guide them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Daily Life</h3>
<p>The diet in the camp is regulated. Breakfast is at 7:00 a.m., soybean milk at 10:00 a.m., lunch at 12:00 p.m., milk at 4:00 p.m., and dinner at 7:00 p.m. The menu is changed daily. The main items are chicken, pork liver, tofu, vegetables, eggs, fish, etc. Lentil porridge, red bean soup, and noodles are also served with lunch and dinner. Fruits are also supplied once or twice a day. Cod liver oil is given once a day, and all the children can swallow it. They get up at 6:00 a.m., nap from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and sleep at 7:30 p.m., sleeping for twelve hours a week. Six children live in the first bedroom, and a female teacher is always on hand to supervise them. Staff members are also assigned to take turns watching the children's sleeping situation at night.</p>
<h3>Hygiene Habits</h3>
<p>Hygiene habits in the camp are especially valued. In addition to the actual experience of an orderly life, it is also planned to use (1) the seven things for health: 1. Diet, 2. Exercise, 3. Rest, 4. Cleaning, 5. Sunlight, 6. Air, 7. Posture, (2) Ten hygiene rules, with forms for teachers and students to check, make marks, and score to encourage them. (3) A declaration to obey health habits and abide by the life in the camp. The swearing ceremony will be held in a week or two. By then, the children will have a full understanding of health knowledge. The results of sunbathing are visible. The relationship between prickly heat and sunlight is very high, mostly due to the activity of bacteria. The use of boric acid powder and other mixtures of wine is very effective.</p>
<h3>Educational Activities</h3>
<p>Educational activities are divided into three categories: indoor and outdoor. (1) Singing and games, (2) Common sense (natural stories, etc.), (3) Drawing. Huang Yunqin and Huang Qiong, both graduates of education, are in charge of this, with eight normal school students assisting as mentors. Students are divided into two groups according to their level for common sense subjects. For outdoor education, the camp is located near various places, and there are trips outside the camp. The vacation homework of each school is inevitably too heavy. It is now decided that healthy children will practice during reading time, and children with poor nutrition will be temporarily suspended and ordered to rest.</p>
<h3>Family Liaison</h3>
<p>The parents of the children in the camp come to visit their children from time to time. The camp sends a receptionist to report the situation, explain the administration, and hope for their cooperation. Recently, it is planned to make visiting rules and order the children to send letters to their parents every week to report on the camp situation. A parent-teacher conference is planned for the fourth week, and the important issues are (1) reporting and explaining the children's shortcomings, hoping that parents will find ways to correct them at any time, (2) continuing the good life in the camp after the children return home. All the food and money brought by the children to the camp are collected and returned to their homes, and fruits are scheduled to be eaten at the rest area. At the parent-teacher conference, people from all walks of life will also be invited, with the purpose of attracting the attention of people from all walks of life to the emerging cause that cannot be ignored and generating considerable sympathy. The date will be decided by Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>The Chinese Agricultural Society's Annual Meeting This Year</p>
<h3>Notice Regarding Preparations for Local Branches</h3>
<p>Fearing that they are not clear, they are distributed for compliance. Since its establishment, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association has appointed preparatory committee members for local branches. At present, local branches have actively taken charge and are proceeding. However, local branches often do not fully understand the points that should be reported to the general association and the items that should be paid attention to during responsible preparations. In view of this, the general association has specially prepared a notice regarding preparations for local branches and distributed them to various places for compliance.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Destroys Banned Books</h3>

<h3>Jiatang Cup Small Ball Tournament Starts Today</h3>
<p>5:30 PM... Hengxin vs. Xiaoxing. The Huacan team is suspended from the Zi competition... The Jianbei team has a bye. The Jiatang Cup, organized by the Shanghai West Small Ball Competition Association, kicks off today. Two groups are participating: Hengxin vs. Xiaoxing, Huacan vs. Jianbei. Due to the Huacan team's poor conduct, with players from the lower social strata, the association has, for caution's sake, warned the team to submit a concrete guarantee letter within 48 hours. However, the team is stubborn and has not submitted the letter. For the sake of the future of sports, the association will strictly punish the Huacan team for its unreasonable and poor conduct, suspending the team from competition. The player certificates that were issued (numbers 631 to 642) are all invalid. The Jianbei team therefore has a bye. The schedule for tomorrow is slightly changed. Originally Guangyi vs. Customs, Hu Qing vs. Feiqiu, now changed to Lingnan vs. Customs, Hu Qing still vs. Feiqiu. There are special reasons for Lingnan vs. Customs, as misunderstandings arose regarding the skill level during last week's Lingnan vs. Jingxiang K and Customs vs. Yuan team matches. Unfortunately, sportsmanship was almost completely lost, which is truly regrettable. The teams later reached an understanding, and the association's committee decided that Lingnan and Customs would replay to determine the champion and runner-up. The referee is specially appointed to be the fair and impartial Mr. Shen Huichun. The weekly schedule is compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>This Week's Schedule</h3>
<p>Today... Saturday Competition Teams Time Referee</p>
<p>Hengxin vs. Xiaoxing 5:30 PM Zhang Le</p>
<p>Tomorrow... Saturday Hu Qing vs. Feiqiu 4:20 PM Zheng Liankun</p>

<h3>New Tennis Techniques (10)</h3>
<p>By J. PARMLY PARET, Translated by Qian Yiqin and Hong Jun | Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited |</p>
<p>If an incoming ball is extremely far to the left, the player is always forced to use a backhand stroke, because if they still want to use a forehand stroke, the player will be forced to run out of bounds. Conversely, if the ball is extremely far to the right, a forehand stroke will naturally force the player to run out of bounds. And when the ball is on an extreme side, if the player insists on forcing a forehand or backhand stroke, they will move far from their fixed position, and after hitting the ball, they will have to exert effort to run back to prepare for the next situation.</p>
<p>Once the player has decided to use a forehand stroke to hit the ball, then all the methods and principles of hitting should be carefully considered. The proper position of the feet and body, and the accurate way of gripping the racket, which have been discussed in the previous chapters, must be thoroughly understood and followed. As for the swing of the racket, arm, and shoulder, it is the most important driving force for hitting, and it must be used freely and without any restraint. Therefore, it must be studied in detail and practiced in reality.</p>
<p>Just before the incoming ball is about to land, the racket should be immediately swung backward. This backward swing should be directly opposite to the forward swing for hitting. Therefore, the forward swing must be like this, and the backward swing must also be like this. If you want to hit an incoming ball horizontally from the plane (Horizontal Fishot), then the pre-swing of the racket should be horizontal, just like the forward swing during hitting. If you want to undercut chop (Undercut chop Stroke), the racket should be raised high backward, far away from the body, because this kind of hit is a downward swing, so after the racket is hit, the racket is at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>The following paragraph was omitted at the end of Chapter 3:</p>
<p>Therefore, when serving, it is not only necessary to have skillful technique and accurate landing, but also to go a step further, so that when the ball reaches the opponent, the receiver will be forced to make a mistake, only then has the serving ability been fully realized. Usually, the ball served to the opponent is deliberately intended to force the receiver to return it with a backhand. Although some people with excellent skills do not have much difference between backhand or forehand, it is necessary for the ball to land in a position that the receiver did not expect. If the receiver is preparing to return with a forehand, the server deliberately makes the ball land on their left side; conversely, the server makes the ball land on their right side. Before serving, the receiver's position to prepare for the return is easy to aim at, so the server must take advantage of this weakness to cause them to make a mistake.</p>
<p>Usually, the best position for a player who serves with their right hand is to stand on the right side and serve the ball to the left side, because this way the ball can be served to the central area of the entire court. However, when serving from the left side of the court, it is easy to be hit by the receiver's extremely fast cross-court return, which is difficult to deal with. Therefore, when serving on the left side, the ball should be served to the center of the court, to the right side of the receiver's position. This way, he can be in the center of the court, avoiding the danger of his cross-court return.</p>
<p>When serving, it is important to exert all the force smoothly. Never stop the racket's momentum immediately after hitting the ball. This is enough to reduce the force of the hit and affect the direction of the ball's landing point. This reason is the same as when returning incoming balls in the court, it is necessary to use smooth force. When the left hand throws the ball upwards, the entire body, shoulders, and arms should be slightly leaning backward, and then suddenly push forward and turn over. Then, the weight of the whole body will naturally increase the force of the hit, thus increasing the power of the ball's flight.</p>
<p>When serving, the feet are very easy to commit fouls, so it is necessary to develop a good habit, so that the feet never cross the baseline. Before the ball has actually left the racket, both feet must be behind the baseline. Touching the baseline with the toes or crossing the baseline in the air is not allowed. Beginners should pay extreme attention to this, because the penalty for a foot fault is the same as the penalty for the ball not hitting over the net, flying out of bounds, or not landing in the opponent's service box. Therefore, before serving, you must pay attention to your feet to prevent them from committing a foul.</p>

<h3>Village Gossip</h3>
<p>— Shadow·Dull</p>
<p>This year, for some reason, the heatwave has swept through the Southeast, a place of cultural prominence. The Minor Heat hasn't even arrived yet, and the weather is already so hot. Not long ago, European and American scientists said there would be no summer this year, didn't they? But in reality, it's even hotter than in previous summers, and it's hot earlier, making us feel that nature controls everything, and even science can't predict it.</p>
<p>These past few days in our countryside, around Songjiang and Qingpu, if we walk around and take a look at all the farmland, it's already a hard expanse of white mud. Very small rice grains, some have already withered, and some are lying sideways on the white mud. All of it makes us feel that the drought has long been brewing.</p>
<p>What the fields need now is water, but it hasn't rained for several decades. Originally, if it doesn't rain, you can pump water, but now the river ports everywhere are either dried up by the fire-like sun or are about to reach the bottom of the river. The water wheels are placed on the banks of the fields, but the plane of the river water has become extremely tilted, so how can water still be pumped? Every day is scorching, every day it doesn't rain. Apart from watching their fields crack and the rice wither, the farmers really have no way to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>It's too hot to work during the day. Waiting until night, when the tide comes, they pump water. Some families have cows, some don't. Those without cows use manpower to pump water. It would be fine if they could pump up some water after a night's work, but when the bottom of the river is about to reach the bottom, water is really impossible to pump up. It's said that one family has two and a half acres of land, and after pumping water all night, part of the ground inside was still white and hard, with no watermarks. It's clear that even pumping water is not easy in a severe drought. But people and cows, working day and night, are already too exhausted to bear it, and the rice is withering day by day.</p>
<p>It's not just the farmers, but ordinary people too, will be unable to bear it if this continues. The river water is shallow and has become smelly because it doesn't flow, but the villagers rely on river water for all their drinking water. Boats can no longer pass, and transportation has long been cut off. Rice prices are soaring. The bankrupt rural areas have long had no surplus rice to sell, but people who buy rice to eat have to increase their burden. In the rural areas, everything, everything is a scene of disaster and suffering! If it doesn't rain again, the farmers will be put to death!</p>
<h3>Heat and Dreams</h3>
<p>— Di Ying</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I endured this rare heatwave of the past sixty years. And the sixth lottery for aviation funds shattered my beautiful dream. These days, it's so hot that I'm cursing myself, it would be better to die.</p>
<p>Damn heavens, since you have bestowed this cruel heatwave, the sixth aviation fund lottery should have given me a first prize. Then, even if the thermometer rises to the boiling point, I would have already made beautiful plans! Mogan Mountain, Lushan, Qingdao, and even Beidaihe, I could leisurely spend this sultry summer there!</p>
<p>Now, the dream is shattered, but the cruel heatwave is forcing the thermometer to rise every day. All the ideal enjoyments are out of the question. But when sweat flows like water, wanting to taste a bottle of soda and touching my pockets, that courage is gone again!</p>
<p>Ah! Hot! Heatwave! I'm cursing myself, it would be better to die!</p>
<h3>Drought Demon</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>The plum rain season should be characterized by intermittent showers. I remember when I was a child, every time during the plum rain season, a little song would float on my lips, called "Sunshine and rain, little devils cart water." This can be said to be an extremely thorough description of the plum rain season. At the same time, we also know that when the sun goes down and it rains, farmers still can't avoid carting water.</p>
<p>But these days, even heaven has changed. Not only does the plum rain season not have intermittent showers, but it doesn't even have a drop of rain. People in the city naturally don't care, but the farmers are really anxious to death. I planted several acres of land, watching the planted seedlings, how uniform, how neat, frogs jumping in the paddy water, small flower snakes swimming, everything is the same as in previous years, the same full of joyous hope, the same going to work, in previous years the harvest was not good, I always felt that my work was not diligent enough, this year I will naturally be particularly diligent, hoping for a better harvest in the future.</p>
<p>However, sweat seeps out from the scorched body, running on the water wheel day and night, the water is considered not too little, look, the riverbeds are turning towards the sky, but the soil in the paddy fields is not moist, although cracked with dry patterns, the seedlings droop their heads, making a dying sigh to their master.</p>
<p>So, the news came that Nanjing was setting up an altar to pray for rain. The small city cut off slaughter, the piglets' lives were extended by a few days, and many triangular flags were inserted on the roofs, with words like "The Heavenly King is on patrol, praying for sweet rain," etc. But this kind of method has long lost its effectiveness, it can't help but be ridiculously laughable, but what is hidden behind this laughable situation? Is it crying or laughing? Is it happiness or sadness? I don't need to say this, let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Having written these miscellaneous things, I'm still dragging a tail. In today's age of scientific advancement, there are ways to remedy both droughts and rain, but Nanjing is also asking for rain in all four cities. No wonder the countryside is even more willing to kneel in the sun and die, but rainwater won't really come just like that.</p>
<h3>People in Hell</h3>
<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>The sun hangs overhead like a ball of fire, surrounded by high walls and thick walls. The street corner is a trash can, next to it is a urinal: the smell of the two mixed together radiates out with the flies. Naturally, there is no gap for the wind to fly in; even if some occasionally do, they have long been turned into hot air, what coolness is there?</p>
<p>People in hell: men are bare-chested, wearing loincloths; even if they don't wear loincloths, they roll up their blue cloth pants high and lie on broken wooden doors. Women wear summer cloth vests and shake palm-leaf fans. Children, whether male or female, are naked, jumping, wriggling, and fighting in the streets. Everyone is waiting for the sun to set and the night god to descend.</p>
<p>When night comes, although there is no sunlight, there is slightly more cool breeze: but heaven never treats the people in hell any better; buzzing mosquitoes sing around you, and you have no way to make them leave. Bedbugs are even more terrifying, and you have to get up several times every night to pat the mat; even if you move to the street to sleep, they will follow you, so what can you do?</p>
<p>People in hell, although they also have considerable envy for the rich, are somewhat ignorant of all their enjoyments; especially for these ways of escaping the summer heat. Electric fans can make wind, it's really a strange thing. What is air conditioning, that's simply a joke. If the old man wants it hot, how can you make it cold? Only ice cream, but it makes them never object: because this thing, as long as you spend two copper coins, you can eat a cup!</p>
<p>People in hell believe in fate; they don't know how to resist. They are just living this hellish life day and night!</p>
<h3>City Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Tang Zenggeng</p>
<p>On a summer night, unable to endure the stifling heat in the pigeon coop, I had to act as a patrolman on this breezy street. Although it is a bright asphalt avenue, there are still bodies of hard-working masses lying along the street, enduring the abuse of the summer god, only hoping to receive some grace on this summer night with a slight breeze.</p>
<p>"Swine, is this a place to sleep? Get up!" Then came the sound of a whip cracking, "Crack!"</p>
<p>It was a patrolman supported by an imperialist, raising a sacred and inviolable face and whipping a man who was sleeping naked.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, I'm sorry, I'll leave right away, right away." Awakened from a sweet dream, touching the fiery whip marks, he could only drag himself away.</p>
<p>"Damn, do you know this is a foreigner's place?" The patrolman's reserved face revealed utter slavishness.</p>
<p>There are more pedestrians on the road than usual, all walking slowly, strolling on this summer night, one by one killing this cool night.</p>
<p>People are sitting everywhere, some are talking loudly, some are flirting and scolding, and some are pulling erhus in their hands, singing Peking opera in straight voices, all the bitter heat of the day has long been left behind.</p>
<p>"Sir, want to hear a song?"</p>
<p>"Sir, Wuxi scenery, Suzhou ballads, Eighteen Touches... want to hear a song?"</p>
<p>It was a mother and daughter, yellow faces, thin bodies, hoping that others would sing a clear song during the cool summer nights. But running through the streets, shouting through the alleys, asking countless men and women, only a few people gave this poor mother and daughter some business. Every night, the desolate singing echoes in this street full of people, still earning immeasurable sadness.</p>
<p>After midnight, there are still traces of people on the streets. The decadent music of the dance halls and the snoring of the people sleeping on the ground play a symphony.</p>
<h3>Dialogue of Wind's Forefront and Rain's Foot</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>Wind's Forefront: "These days, I've stolen the show entirely. There's no place for you to stand here."</p>
<p>Rain's Foot: "I know the weight of things, so I tread carefully and don't go out easily. A few days ago, I happened to visit Yangzhou, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and other places, and I was very welcomed by the local people, unlike you, who only seek fame recklessly and are scolded by people!"</p>
<p>Wind's Forefront: "Ha! Welcomed? You don't have a place to stand here after all, so you went to Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces to stir up trouble and cause big problems. I ask you, are the people there also welcoming you?"</p>
<p>Rain's Foot: "Don't misunderstand! I've been living in seclusion recently, staying at home. I'm afraid some bad elements among my kind are performing their tricks."</p>
<p>Wind's Forefront: Suddenly emitted a violent roar of laughter, as if mocking Rain's Foot for using its old trick of hiding evil and plundering beauty!</p>
<h3>Cow Shoes</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>This year, we've encountered an unprecedented dry plum rain season. It hasn't rained for a long time, and the weather is breaking sixty-year records. The river water is as dry as the previous year's flood was severe. But this is when rice paddies are in dire need of water. The old cows of the farm families, because the river water is shallow, are working very hard to cart water, so they are being whipped by the farmers, driving the carts day and night without stopping. Most of their feet are worn through, making it difficult to walk. But they can't stop working because of this. So the farmers have a sudden inspiration, making special leather shoes for the cows with foot problems to wear, and still ordering them to work as usual. Although they are slower than cows without foot problems, they are still much better at working hard for the public good with shoes on. Alas! This year's old cows can be considered particularly hard-working!</p>
<h3>Heatwave Hits Shanghai - Sketches of Gujiazhai Park</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>102.7 degrees, 104.4 degrees, the heat rising day by day. Even the asphalt roads are sweating, let alone people with flesh and blood bodies, how can they withstand such roasting? At night, the alley entrances and roadsides are filled with people sleeping, like an exhibition of human bodies. During the day, one might sit at the alley entrance, but on the roadside, it's best to be absent. It's better to find a slightly more open space to catch a breath of air. Therefore, these days, friends living in the French Concession are flocking to Gujiazhai Park like a tide. I am naturally one of the bubbles in the tide. Now, I will sketch the various scenes inside the park below:</p>
<p>Under any tree in the park that provides a bit of shade, people are sitting. Especially under the rows of French plane trees, where the dense shade is like a canopy, there are even more people. However, those sitting underneath seem to be regulars - foreign nannies, an enjoyment not available to the average person swept in by the heatwave.</p>
<p>A Chinese lady is sitting on a movable deck chair, fanning herself with a palm-leaf fan, watching the later arrivals who can't find a chair, showing a very smug and proud expression. Suddenly, an acquaintance approaches. As she stands up to greet them, unexpectedly, the deck chair behind her, like the three northeastern provinces, is dragged away by some mischievous foreign children without any resistance. She can only stare at them with wide eyes.</p>
<p>By the eastern pond, the tap of the water fountain is constantly dispensing clean water. Many people bend over, raise their heads, and open their mouths wide to drink. The weather is just too hot. So hot that it's hard to breathe, so they quench their thirst, regardless of whether the water is safe to drink.</p>
<p>Vendors carrying iced Dutch water and fresh orange juice in rattan baskets walk up to you, asking if you want to buy. Red, yellow, white, the colors are so appealing. Unfortunately, the price is a bit high, so you can only swallow your saliva while looking at it. However, sales are still strong. In an instant, a basket is left with only empty bottles.</p>
<p>A Russian lady has spread a tattered bed sheet and is sleeping in the pavilion, her long hair radiating curvaceous beauty. She's panting from the heat. Next to her, two children are playing on the ground, their bodies as dirty as piglets. After a while, the Russian lady wakes up, yawns, sits up, opens the broken rattan basket beside her, and takes out black bread, yellow borscht, and a "sarsaparilla"-like liquid. She feeds the children and eats herself. This is probably their lunch?</p>
<p>Chinese "amah" (nannies) are sitting under the trees in groups, each with foreign children. In front of each one is a sewing basket, a glass bottle filled with water, some children's toys, and various types of baby carriages on display. They are all looking down, dozing off, unable to sew because it's just too hot!</p>
<p>By the pond, several small parasols are tilted. Looking out from behind each umbrella, there are two pairs of different feet lined up side by side. Under the umbrellas, there are probably pairs of lovers whispering sweet nothings? They use umbrellas to shield their faces from others seeing their embarrassing affections. These couples in the park are the only ones who don't feel the heat!</p>
<p>Several mischievous Chinese children are doing somersaults in the flowerbed. A police officer with a pointed hat sees them, and they run away in fright. One of the younger ones can't run fast enough and is caught by the pointed-hat officer, who slaps him twice. The Chinese child doesn't dare to cry. This is probably the success of the non-resistance indoctrination?</p>
<p>A group of foreign children are playing with mud under a tree. When they see a Chinese person walking by, they unexpectedly throw a handful of sand and pebbles at them, almost blinding them. The pointed-hat police officer stands in front, raising his head and looking at the white clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>The sun has gone down! The central lawn is covered with people lying down haphazardly. Some are in groups of three or five, talking and laughing. Some are in pairs, leaning against each other. Some are all alone, watching with envy, and humming "Taohua River is a Den of Beauties" or "Sister, I Love You."</p>

<p>Specie Price Rises by Five and a Half Yuan Due to Frequent Purchases by Major Players; The Gold Market Had Been Sluggish for Days, Suddenly Sees Firmness Yesterday, although there were many short sales from Guangdong merchants, the demand exceeded the supply, even breaking through the 90 yuan barrier. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw both British and American markets shrink, with the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange shrinking by 1 to 2 li. The exchange rate rose, with London raw gold falling by 2 pence, US cotton falling by 12 points, US wheat at 1875, and stocks falling by 1 yuan and 3 fen. Preliminary trading opened steadily, with the situation remaining flat after opening, merely fluctuating. Japanese banks had a very strong appetite, aggressively buying forward US dollars, which pulled up the gold market. However, because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listing remained unchanged, there was still fluctuation. The banks were aggressively selling near-term US dollars, and Sassoon once tried to sell September US dollars at 34.1875 but found no buyers, leading to a decline. Finally, as confidence returned and major players became active, the market became extremely stable, fluctuating around 6 yuan. Banks continued to buy forward US dollars. The Seattle night market silver price reported a shrinkage of 125, a half point, and a 25 point signal, indicating a rebound. However, due to the strong selling pressure from Guangdong merchants, there was some struggle. After entering the market, major players continuously and aggressively purchased, pulling up the gold market. The midday close was very strong. The market opened higher in the afternoon due to the lingering effect of the midday close. After opening, the exchange market seemed tight, and the Seattle night market silver price reported no change and a shrinkage of 25, leading to even higher prices, but there was a slight pullback. The Bombay telegram reported a drop of 3/4 anna. Major players continued to purchase aggressively. Although Guangdong merchants were selling US dollars, the banks were aggressively buying, tightening the exchange market, and breaking through the 90 yuan barrier. Later, as Guangdong merchants continued to sell and banks also sold, prices slightly declined after rising. However, as Bombay fell again by 1.2 anna, there was still a struggle around the 90 yuan mark. The market closed within the barrier. The market situation for the day was exceptionally firm, with major players such as Dadecheng and Qianchangxiang aggressively purchasing. The selling power was insufficient, leading to this result. The price of pure gold was 998 yuan and 6 jiao, with a swap premium of 5 and a half yuan. The market situation for the day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 985 yuan and 6 jiao, a recovery of 1 yuan and 2 jiao from the previous close. Spot goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices, British exchange at 1 shilling, 4 pence, 125, and US exchange at 33.9375. The situation fluctuated at the start.

Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong, Yongli, Hengyu, Qingfayong, and Yuanchun all entered the market, pushing the price up to 6 yuan and 9 jiao. Huixiang, Yifengyong, and Fuan took advantage of the high prices to sell, bringing the price down to around 6 yuan. Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, and Hengyu continued to buy, keeping the situation stable. Anticipating the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listing, British and American exchanges remained flat. Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, and Tongtaichang continuously offered to sell, pushing the price down to 5 yuan and 9 jiao. Shunmao entered the market, pushing the price up to 7 and a half yuan.

The Seattle night market silver price reported a shrinkage of 125 to half a point. Shunli, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang jointly and aggressively purchased, leading to a recovery to 6 yuan and a half. Shengda aggressively sold, briefly bringing the price down to 6 jiao. However, Dadecheng and Qianchangxiang continued to purchase aggressively. Hengyu, Hongkangyong, and Yuqingyong also joined in. Confidence suddenly surged. The midday close rose to 986 yuan and 9 jiao, with spot goods trading at 7 yuan. The market opened even stronger after the close, at 987 yuan and 7 jiao, with spot goods opening at the same price.

Yongfeng, Xinchang, Tongchang, Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Hengxingyuan, Futaiheng, Zhentai, Yuanyi, Dadecheng, Yuanshengyong, and Qingfayong all joined in. The night market silver price reported no change and a slight 25 point signal, pushing the price up to 9 yuan and 4 jiao. Mitsui also bought August US dollars at 34 yuan. Hengyu, Qingyu, and Fuxingyong took advantage of the high prices to sell. Guangdong merchants sold US dollars, bringing the price down to 8 yuan and 6 jiao. Bombay fell by 4 anna. Yuqingyong, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dacheng, Cuitai, Zhengchang, and Dalian merchants repeatedly bought, pushing the gold market beyond the 90 yuan barrier, even rising to 90 yuan and 9 jiao. Shengda continued to sell US dollars. Although the British bank bought November US dollars at 25, they lacked purchasing power at this point. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Senchangyong, Yuanmaoyong, and Yongli all sold off. Mitsui released October US dollars at 125, bringing the price down to 89 yuan and 7 jiao. Qingfayong and Tongchang still bought. Bombay fell again by 1 anna, pushing the price back up to outside the 90 yuan mark. However, the closing price was 989 yuan and 9 jiao, with spot goods trading at 9 yuan and 8 jiao. After the close, Yuanyi, Yuanchangyong, Chengkang, and Yuanmaoyong sold off, causing a decline. The highest price during the day was 990 yuan and 9 jiao, and the lowest price was 985 yuan and 1 jiao, a fluctuation of 5 yuan and 8 jiao. The result was a further increase of 5 and a half yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's US exchange listing remaining unchanged, was calculated at 33 yuan and 625, equivalent to a specie price of 1029 yuan.

The August registered price was 991 yuan, and the September price was 987 yuan. The morning supplemental payment was 991 yuan, and the afternoon supplemental payment was 994 yuan.

Compared to the previous close, the British and American exchange rates were slightly tight. After the opening, banks were aggressively buying forward contracts, making the situation appear tight. However, as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listing was announced, the British and American exchange rates were flat, and banks also sold, resulting in a calm recent process. Sassoon attempted to sell September US dollars at 18.75 but failed, resulting in a slight loosening. Later, banks continued to buy forward contracts, and the night market silver price dropped by 125 to half a point, indicating a potentially tight situation. The market later tended to tighten, with the night market silver price unchanged and shrinking by 25. Bombay decreased by 3/4 anna. Although Guangdong merchants were selling, banks were aggressively buying forward US dollars, resulting in an unusually tight process. November tightened from 375 to 25 before slightly leveling off, likely due to Shengda continuing to sell while banks also sold slightly.

<h3>Silver Coin Business Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>The financial industry today presents a picture of decline. All transactions are not only sluggish as before but are also perceived to be worsening. Progress is difficult, retreat is impossible, leading to apathy among participants who often merely go through the motions in the trading arena. The market atmosphere is therefore even quieter. Various market conditions remain as dull as ever. Yesterday, the market interest rate was still 5%, and there was no added water for the "cutting head" fee. Transactions for the dismantling of notes, the morning transfer of funds, and new transactions amounted to over 3.7 million. Afternoon transactions amounted to just over 100,000. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 500,000. Silver mortgage transactions totaled over 900,000 for retrieval and over 800,000 for new transactions. The receipts of banks also showed no signs of improvement. Foreign banks received over 1.6 million in note receipts and over 2.9 million in various cargo exchange guarantees. Forty thousand were taken out of the warehouse. Chinese banks received over 2.1 million in note receipts, over 4.4 million in various cargo exchange guarantee, over 500,000 in customs duties. Thirty thousand were entered the warehouse. Private money exchange received over 2.2 million in ocean common bills and over 3.2 million in various cargo exchange guarantee. Fifty thousand were taken out of the warehouse. Private money exchange received over 33 million in ocean common bills and over 4.3 million in ocean cutting head fees. Receipts from various remittance routes amounted to over 40,000. Banknote withdrawals and issuances totaled over 2 million. Cash receipts amounted to over 600,000. Customer source amounted to over 200,000, while withdrawal amounted to over 350,000. In addition, the total exchange volume of the Shanghai Clearing House on the 20th was 11,148,836.85 yuan, including 5,854,139.72 yuan in silver coins and 5,633,897.13 yuan in transferred funds.</p>
<h3>Guangjiao Weakens, Copper Coins Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars, although dropping by one yuan in the morning to 834 yuan, returned to the original position of 835 yuan by midday. Therefore, the result was the same as the previous day. The transaction volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning and 8,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars, after rising for several consecutive days, weakened yesterday. The morning transaction was 726 yuan and 9 jiao, and the afternoon transaction was 726 yuan and 3 jiao. The result was a decrease of 1 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 55,000 jiao in the morning and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins, on the other hand, recovered by 1,500 cash compared to the previous day, trading at 329,500 cash. The transaction price was 9,100 silver dollars, totaling an amount of 29,984 strings and 500 cash.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Weak and Soft, Numerous Floating Positions Emerge</h3>
<p>Falling by more than one yuan and returning to the original price. Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the continued turmoil of political unrest, the saying that Mr. Huang, the President, was also weary and wanted to retire, and President Yu's negative attitude, the market sentiment suddenly became weak and soft, floating positions emerged, and swaps arose. However, due to the proximity of the settlement period, there were also many shorts doing swaps. The 96 bond, due to the talk of consolidation, only bloomed briefly. The floating positions were crowded, and the decline was particularly sharp, with a tendency to return to the original price. Due to environmental factors, the trend was not to converge. As for yesterday, due to the short covering of "compilation remnants" and "troop reduction," the rebound was limited. After entering the market, there was a slight downturn. The near-term was relatively strong, and the forward was weak, mostly falling by three or four jiao. The 96 bond fell sharply by six or seven jiao. In the second round, the shorts seized the opportunity to continue covering, resulting in short covering, and then fell again by one or two jiao to more than half a yuan. Transactions were mostly trending temporarily weak. The market price resulted in a drop of one or two jiao to about one yuan, but the 96 bond fell by more than one yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 12 to 13 million yuan. The rise and fall are compared in the table below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Declines More Than Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company The New York Stock Market yesterday (19th) first rose due to optimistic attitudes from all sides toward the strike wave, and then returned due to weakness in goods and wheat. An investigation into the dumping of goods and wheat was due to rumors of new incidents occurring in Germany, with the recent death toll from the rebellion reaching two thousand. It was also rumored that Bapu had unified the whole country. Later, after hearing the official announcement of the denial, goods and wheat then rebounded to highs. However, securities were still lower than before due to a lack of purchases. Among foreign exchanges, the mark against the US dollar rose by half a point. Experts believed that this was due to Russian commercial purchases. Small stock market trading was more relaxed, and the bond market was more solid. The total daily transaction volume was 610,000 shares. (Securities) Although several stocks were weaker yesterday, the market was generally still strong. (Grains) The news was extremely favorable to the long side. Due to the extreme heat in the western and southwestern United States, the loss of corn has increased. It is advisable to purchase when prices fall. (Cotton) The market was slightly lower, first due to a rain shower in a part of East Texas, then due to rumors of adverse incidents found in Germany, and the reduction in demand among peers. The spot price was unstable when prices rose, but drought news was still the main force influencing the market. (Rubber) The market was extremely flat due to peer and foreign purchases, with solid goods being higher than the exchange price. (Sugar) The market was stable, with good demand for spot goods. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Standard Yarn Falls by More Than One Yuan Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline has reappeared. Due to the loose cotton market and the sales of yarn are more quiet than before, therefore the market sentiment is weak. And the settlement date of this month is approaching. It is said that there are already 2,000 bales of new yarn for delivery, but there are still few consignees, probably mostly arbitrageurs in the financial industry. Therefore, although the intention of buyers is strong, the environment is not very optimistic. The market price is fluctuating between 2 and 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>This Month's Lack of Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Before the trading began for standard yarn, market sentiment was still average. As it was being bid on, prices for forward months fell by three to four "jiao" (a unit of currency). This was influenced by a drop of over ten pounds in American cotton prices. Those purchasing spot goods for the current month were relatively few, especially for near months, which dragged down forward months. As the bidding continued towards the closing market, the situation further weakened due to a decline in raw cotton prices. It's reported that current yarn transactions are slow, with a slight increase in selling pressure. Forward months are difficult to stabilize due to high prices. Consequently, prices across all months dropped by nine "jiao" to one "yuan" and one "jiao" three "fen". The total volume of transactions was recorded at 15,700 bales. Sales included 450 bales from Hengyi, 1,050 bales from Danong, 350 bales from Xinchang, 550 bales from Zhenda, 400 bales from Gu Da, 400 bales from Taichang, and 450 bales from Xie Sheng. Purchases included 500 bales from Suilong, 400 bales from Yuanda, 700 bales from Tongfeng, 800 bales from Renfeng, 500 bales from Yuan Yi, 850 bales from Changfeng, 700 bales from Dachang, and 350 bales from Chong'an. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3>Weak Spot Sales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain average. Daily purchases by various groups totaled 646 bales. The market situation is similar to the previous day. The purchase volume for each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou 45, Tianjin 250, Nanjing 5, Sichuan 70, Ningbo 1, Inland 175, Yanhu 45, Guangdong 35, Jiangxi 20</p>
<h3>Hubei Merchants Routinely Selling Short Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market continues to decline. American cotton, which had been rising for several days, reversed today and fell, further weakening confidence. The condition of new cotton appears increasingly unfavorable. Reports indicate widespread rainfall, which has greatly benefited cotton fields. Consequently, Hubei merchants are routinely selling short. Deliveries of old cotton continue to surge, though some have switched from short to long positions. However, the actual market demand appears increasingly quiet.</p>
<h3>Both Standard New and Old Cotton Fall</h3>
<p>Before the trading began for standard cotton, the market declined because American cotton reversed and fell by over ten pounds. This weakened confidence and reduced the number of buyers. Although there was some buying of old cotton by those in long positions, deliveries remained ample. New cotton was stabilized by rain after a drought, and Hubei merchants were selling short. Combined with the poor performance of yarn factories, the market fell. As a result, old cotton fell by one to one and a half "jiao," and new cotton fell by three "jiao." The total volume of transactions was recorded at 85,000 "dan." Sales included 4,200 "dan" from Dafu, 2,200 "dan" from Tongji, 2,000 "dan" from Hengyi, 2,700 "dan" from Dafeng, 1,500 "dan" from Renfeng, 1,100 "dan" from Yicheng, 2,700 "dan" from Changfeng, 3,700 "dan" from Xincheng, and 1,000 "dan" from Ruiyuan. Purchases included 1,500 "dan" from Meiji, 5,700 "dan" from Yuanda, 3,200 "dan" from Shenchang, 1,100 "dan" from Hengde, 1,800 "dan" from Taichang, 2,300 "dan" from Yichang, 3,900 "dan" from Dachang, and 1,500 "dan" from Yuanxingchang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3>Fine Cotton Still Being Traded</h3>
<p>The current consumption of cotton is fairly slow. Demand from factories is sluggish. The source is 440 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Cotton: 45.00. Hengfeng Factory purchased 200 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory. American Cotton: 46.75. Hongzhang Factory purchased 200 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory. Hankou Fine Cotton: 44.75. Dacheng Factory purchased 100 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the warehouse.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Firm, Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to dry weather, but later weakened due to long positions being closed and short selling. As a result, spot prices fell by ten pounds, and futures prices fell by eleven to fifteen pounds. British cotton futures rose by seven points. Indian cotton was initially soft due to long positions being closed, but later rose due to positive news from Liverpool and speculative buying. As a result, Ping Gu Er was unchanged, Aomula fell by half a "luobi," and Bai Luo Xi rose by half a "luobi." (Telegraph from the 19th)</p>

<h3>Standard Flour Sees Startling High Prices</h3>
<p>All months surge uniformly by about five "fen." The flour market yesterday, after opening in the morning, showed a soaring trend in all months. The quotations for imported wheat from Chicago were up by about twelve "jiao," and from Canada by about four or five "jiao." Although continued rainfall was seen in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and inland areas, and public sentiment seemed slightly calmer, the drought in the south had just been alleviated when floods were reported in Northeast China. This changed the psychology of those outside the industry, giving speculators more leverage. When the prices were opened, the current month was immediately quoted at two "jiao" eight "fen," then gradually increased. When the prices for forward months were opened, many long positions outside the industry eagerly bought. Merchants from Dalian and Yingkou were also buying enthusiastically. As a result, the market was soaring to unprecedented heights. After the second session, merchants bought the current month, further fueling bullish sentiment in forward months. The highest price for November reached two "yuan" three "jiao" nine "fen," and for December, two "yuan" four "jiao" zero two and a half "li," marking the highest new record in one or two years. If there is no government supervision or price controls in the future, the prospect for people's food supply is deeply concerning. As a result, the current month rose by four and a half "fen," August rose by five "fen" two and a half "li," September rose by five "fen" seven and a half "li," October rose by four "fen" two and a half "li," November rose by four "fen" seven and a half "li," and December rose by four "fen."</p>
<h3>Main Reasons for Renewed Rise in Futures Wheat</h3>
<p>Imported wheat continues to rise… Floods in Northeast China, shorts urgently cover… Transactions very brisk. Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a uniform rise in all months. The quotations for imported wheat from Chicago and Canada continued to rise by one or two "jiao" to four or five "jiao." When the prices were opened, as continuous welcome rains were received in the local area and other places, public sentiment inevitably stabilized, so the current month opened only at three "yuan" three "jiao." However, thereafter it soared wildly, becoming increasingly severe, because Northeast China reported flooding again. From this point forward, the need for food may shift towards purchasing from inland areas. Therefore, the shorts were panicked and hurriedly covered, and many chips from industry insiders were also covered. In addition, many long positions from outsiders returned, causing the market to rise step by step, and trading was very active. However, the market price of the current month also rose sharply because of the settlement relationship, and covering short positions was particularly strong. As a result, the current month rose by one "jiao," August rose by eight "fen," September rose by seven "fen," October rose by six "fen," November rose by five "fen," and December rose by six "fen." The spot wheat market also appears expensive because the standard prices have risen wildly. Customers relentlessly try to sell, and the various stalls are also calling for prices that are six, seven, or eight "fen" higher. Kai Ming Guang Jiangjia Damai sells for three "yuan" three "jiao" four "fen," Bengbu wheat sells for three "yuan" three and a half "jiao," Baoying Taizhou Shandong wheat sells for three "yuan" three "jiao," Guandian wheat sells for three "yuan" three "jiao" two "fen," Yangzhou Yaowan wheat sells for three "yuan" two "jiao" two "fen," Daqiao wheat sells for three "yuan" two "jiao" two or three "fen," Qingjiang wheat sells for three "yuan" three "jiao" and second grade for two "jiao" eight "fen," Hankou wheat sells for three "yuan" one "jiao" and second grade for two "yuan" nine "jiao," Anqing wheat sells for three "yuan" one "jiao" two "fen," Bianjiang wheat sells for two "yuan" nine "jiao," and Pukou wheat sells for three "yuan" one "jiao" eight "fen." Fuxin purchased 8,000 bags, and Fufeng purchased 5,000 bags.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market in Hexia Is Weak But Firm</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of supply for the various groups were still limited to only five or six vendors (approximately 2,000 "shi" of goods). Sales were also sluggish. Procurement from the local market was minimal, and sales to outside customers were completely halted. Some were determined to hold on, while others were planning to sell off completely. Each did as they pleased, causing the market to be in a state of chaos. Prices also fell, with varying degrees of decline. Thick "Jing" rice and late rice fell by two, three, four, or five "jiao." Suddenly at midday, buyers arrived in the market, raising hopes for a turnaround in the prices of freshly harvested goods. Du Yang's "Jian" rice, however, continued to decline by three or four "jiao" due to poor quality, with only "Yuan" rice remaining stable due to scarcity.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten suppliers arrived from various routes in Hexia. The price of early "Bai Jing" rice continued its downward trend. Although the weather was intermittently overcast and rainy, the stores' buying interest turned active, causing the market to turn from weak to firm. Sales of "Bai Yuan" and various "Jian" rice were average, and prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Merchants Also Hoarding for Higher Prices</h3>
<p>Fixed prices rise… Shanghai market must suffer losses, rice merchants anxious… Exerting every effort to seek tax exemption. Yesterday's foreign Indica rice market, while local customers' appetite was strong, most were temporarily watching and waiting for a change in the market. Orders for foreign rice continued to be negotiated and telegraphed. No fewer than hundreds of thousands of bags were telegraphed, but production prices have already risen, and yesterday's telegram showed a further increase of four or five "jiao." These telegrams still reflect the market conditions of two or three days ago, making it difficult to reach a deal. If high prices are fixed, losses can be expected, because the current Shanghai market has already fallen, and the cost price must be nearly one "yuan" higher. If prices fall further, the difference will be even greater. Only some rice merchants hope that the authorities will exempt import taxes, so that it can be combined, and representatives are recommended to go to Beijing to petition. However, even if tax exemption becomes a reality, Shanghai prices must fall again, and if production prices are higher again, it will be difficult to calculate high and low. Yesterday's decline in transactions was mostly due to waiting for news of the petition, and public sentiment has been calmed after the rain, and more people have arrived, and import users are not as competitive as before, so the price of rough rice has fallen by a small "jiao," and the price of machine Indica rice has been stable. In the afternoon, due to the rise in foreign rice prices, the price of small grain Indica rice was called one "jiao" higher. A total of 2,000 bags of small grain Indica rice and 4,500 bags of machine rough rice were opened for sale, and were purchased by local, inland, and Ningbo groups.</p>
<h3>Sales of Jiujiang Chengmendou (Soybeans) Still Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of high-quality yellow soybeans rose due to active sales of small quantities. Zhengyangguan soybeans opened at three "yuan" one "jiao" two to three "fen." Due to the factory's lack of interest, the market for Zhongguan goods was weaker, and prices did not fluctuate for the time being. The total number of soybeans traded in the city was more than ten cartloads of various types. New soybeans, such as Hankou Fenqing soybeans, were rejected by buyers due to their poor quality, and sales have not yet begun due to the arrival of later batches. A total of more than 460 bags of Jiujiang Chengmendou arrived, with varying qualities, slightly inferior to the first batch. The market price rose because the supply was not high and because inland, local, and Ningbo merchants were purchasing, with high-quality goods opening at three "yuan" five "jiao" and Zhongguan goods trading at three "yuan" four "jiao" and a half.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Limited transactions in Chaoqing sugar. Yesterday's sugar market saw a firming of the customs gold in the afternoon, closing at 1.990, hence the trend was relatively stable. The association set the price for No. 24 coarse sand white sugar at 19 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen for both spot and general goods, 19 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen for local warehouse goods, and sales of transshipment goods were still good, with more than 2,000 bags traded at a price of 6 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, Dutch red sugar at 15 yuan 3 jiao, and transshipment at 6 yuan 2 jiao. Taikoo Sugar B mark at 20 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, and local factory No. 1 refined sugar at 18 yuan 9 jiao. More than 200 bags of Chaoqing sugar were opened for sale, with Bannanqing at 12 yuan 8 jiao, Youbao Longjiangqing at 12 yuan 4 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, Gaozhuang at 12 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, a good start of 5 fen. Huizhou white sugar continued to be opened for sale at a price of 17 yuan 8 or 9 jiao, and more than 100 bags of Rupen sugar were opened for sale, with assorted brands at 7 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3>Wood Ear Continues to Soar in Price</h3>
<p>The source of wood ear is blocked, and Hankou continues to rise and increase, according to the telegram, it is nearly 90 yuan. Plus all the external costs, it should be in the range of 100 yuan. The inventory here is inherently lacking, and the price for social trading a few days ago was around 90 yuan, but the land price is increasing day by day, and the market price is rising accordingly. For example, aviation small package ear is even calling for 110 yuan, and the higher original package assorted ear is 105 yuan. Although no deal has been made, if the source continues to be blocked in this way, then this price will inevitably be reached.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Hankou Tung Oil Has a Turning Point, Bailing Tung Oil Last week, due to the slackening of the sales channel of foreign companies in the Hankou market, the price fell to 28 yuan 4 jiao, but recently foreign companies have been working hard to purchase goods, and the market has turned around. According to the previous telegram received by the local Hankou, it said that Xiangtong's falling prices had been opened at 24 yuan for the customer regulations. At this time of domestic sales depression, the situation suddenly tightened, and although the telegram was not detailed, it was always due to the continued delivery by foreign companies. Sure enough, yesterday evening's Hankou letter detailed 50 tons of transactions at 29 yuan, so the market showed a tight situation again. Zhejiang Tung had already sold more than 26 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen per stone to Shen, but according to the Hangzhou counterparts who came to Shen to sell, it must be 26 yuan 6 jiao, which is the lowest limit, which shows that the Hangzhou market has also received the news of the Hankou market's rise. Although there are foreign sales channels, there is no need to worry about the rise and fall, which is a common state, and it can be undoubtedly concluded that there is no hope of cheapness in the market. Moreover, the source in the Hankou market is particularly scarce, so from the past market conditions, I am afraid that it is always circling and turning around, and an excessive rise is not desired, because no matter how much the production is reduced, there will always be a time when we will have to tighten our belts.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Pingshui Pearl Tea Trading Liver Yesterday's local foreign tea market, Pingshui pearl tea from Huzhou Fuxing and other places, European sales turned active, the city was bought by Jinlong Tongfu Duder and other foreign firms, more than 3,000 boxes, trading was unusually strong, but the opening price was 2 or 3 yuan lower than before, to Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea, Tunxi Wudong Shexian and other goods, trading was smooth, but Wuyuan North Road Zhenmei, the market is still sluggish, Lianghu black tea, the sales channel of British Zhuang, is also not lonely, but the market is still falling and not rising.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Tianjin Min Customers Are Moving To Handle Huis Steel, Huis Steel, Because the major cigarette companies in this street stopped purchasing, the market situation was depressed. Recently, purchases from Fujian and Tianjin have increased sharply, so the number of transactions in the past two days has reached as many as four or five hundred boxes, and a canning factory in Tianjin is still in contact, and the number of transactions will also reach more than 500 boxes, and the market price has risen sharply. Now the old steel factory goods are sold at 28 yuan per box, and the new steel factory goods are 27 yuan 5 jiao, and the new steel factory's subsidiary goods are opened at 27 yuan, which is 2 or 3 jiao more expensive than the previous valuation.</p>

<p>Shortwave Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Shortwave Communications</h3>
<p>— Jian Cun</p>
<p>To discuss the evolution of shortwave communications, one must delve into the entire history of radio, as shortwave communication has not evolved in isolation. It has progressed through iterative developments of shortwave, medium wave, and long wave, culminating in its present state. However, recounting this entire history within this brief space is impossible. Therefore, I will only outline aspects pertaining to shortwave communications.</p>
<p>The experiments in radio began in 1887, just over thirty years ago. At that time, Hertz began experimenting to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves. The waves initially discovered by Hertz were extremely shortwaves with wavelengths of only a few meters. Their characteristics were similar to light waves, exhibiting phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and interference. By 1924, scholars had successfully experimented with even shorter waves of 0.001 meters. However, these waves were all damped waves, significantly different from the constant-amplitude waves commonly used today.</p>
<p>In the early days of shortwave discovery, the inconvenience of their generation, the incompleteness of the receiving devices, and the nature of damped waves caused significant absorption of transmission power over large spaces, preventing long-distance communication. This was the reason for the initial lack of development in shortwave technology.</p>
<p>During the early experiments of Marconi and others, the transmitting devices used self-inductance coils and spark-gap discharges to oscillate the antenna circuit. The wavelength generated by this very classical method was determined by the size of the antenna, which directly affected the communication distance. Consequently, there was a trend towards installing large antennas, and the use of wavelengths gradually became limited to long waves. However, due to the surge in amateur researchers using spark-gap transmitters, the airspace became extremely congested.</p>
<p>After the invention of the triode vacuum tube in 1906, generating constant-amplitude waves became much easier, and the sensitivity of the receivers improved. As a result, amateur experimenters abandoned spark-gap damped wave experiments and began focusing on vacuum tube constant-amplitude waves. Gradual progress eventually led to the discovery of the astonishing characteristics of shortwaves: even with minimal power, they could achieve long-distance communication and were less susceptible to atmospheric noise. This attracted the attention of experts, who concentrated their research on shortwaves. This is a brief overview of the evolution of shortwave technology.</p>
<h3>The Definition of Shortwave</h3>
<p>— Hua Meng</p>
<p>What is shortwave, and what is its wavelength? The boundaries have varied across different eras. Before shortwave was put into practical use, the 375 to 600 kilocycle (800 to 500 meter) wavelength band used for ship communications, and even the 600 to 1500 kilocycle (500 to 200 meter) band used for broadcasting, were all called shortwave. As even higher frequency waves came into widespread use, the previous definition of shortwave had to be revised.</p>
<p>According to the wave classification determined by the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) at its first meeting in The Hague, Netherlands, the categories are as follows:</p>
<p>Name Frequency (kilocycles per second) Wavelength (meters) Longwave 100 and below 3,000 and above Medium wave 100 to 1,500 3,000 to 200 Medium-short wave 1,500 to 6,000 200 to 50 Shortwave 6,000 to 30,000 50 to 10 Ultra-short wave 30,000 and above 10 and below</p>
<p>As can be seen from the classification, what is called shortwave today refers to the range from 6,000 to 30,000 kilocycles, namely the wavelength band from 50 to 10 meters.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Shortwave Characteristics</h3>
<p>— Hua Xin</p>
<p>Recently, research on shortwave radio has been extremely popular, and it has a tendency to replace longwave in the field of radio communication. Moreover, its application scope has extended to physics, chemistry, and medicine, and its various astonishing characteristics are becoming clearer.</p>
<p>The most surprising characteristic is the ability to perform long-distance communication of thousands of kilometers with minimal power. However, the use of low power is limited to amateur communication. Commercial communication tends to use high power for various reasons.</p>
<p>Secondly, experiments have shown that the higher the frequency of the wave, the less the interference from atmospheric noise. Longwave reception often encounters atmospheric interference, and although there are various methods to eliminate it, the effect is minimal. However, during thunderstorms, shortwave is relatively easier to receive than longwave. This is also one of the advantages of shortwave.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in shortwave, it is easy to perform directional communication to ensure power economy and communication secrecy. The higher the frequency of the wave, the closer its properties are to light waves, and the sharper its directional characteristics. Moreover, the antenna equipment can be small, so the construction cost can be reduced. Now most commercial shortwave stations mostly use directional types.</p>
<p>Finally, the most interesting fact is that specialists believe that future wireless television can use ultra-shortwave, extremely shortwave, and even infrared, light waves, and ultraviolet rays for directional transmission to distant places.</p>
<p>The advantages of shortwave are as described above, but its disadvantages are also not few.</p>
<p>In terms of shortwave characteristics, the most unsatisfactory aspects are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Zone of Silence and Skipped Distance: Experiments have shown that shortwave transmission to a certain distance results in extremely weak signal strength, or even no signal at all. However, after a considerable distance, the signal strength increases again. The area where the signal strength is weak or non-existent is called the zone of silence, and the distance at which the signal strength increases again is called the skipped distance. The skipped distance varies with changes in wavelength, day and night, time of year, and season. The situation is quite complex. However, the skipped distance obtained from theory is generally consistent with the measured results, so this phenomenon has gradually become clear.</p>
<p>(2) Fading: In terms of shortwave characteristics, there is also the phenomenon of fading, which occurs far from the transmitting station. The signals received in this area fluctuate rapidly between strong and weak. This is due to the mutual interference of sky waves and ground waves. This fading phenomenon is not limited to shortwave; wavelengths above medium wave also exhibit it. Longwave does not, nor does ultra-shortwave. The occurrence of shortwave fading is most pronounced in locations several hundred kilometers outside the zone of silence. Its occurrence is irregular, which is detrimental to high-speed communication and wireless telephone.</p>
<p>(3) Echo: Also a phenomenon unique to shortwave. After receiving a signal, the same signal arrives repeatedly, like an echo. According to experts' speculation, this phenomenon seems to be caused by the same wave traveling different distances to reach the receiver. In severe cases, it can interfere with the progress of reception.</p>
<h3>Shortwave Communication Distance</h3>
<p>— Qing Zhao</p>
<p>Among the characteristics of shortwaves, what satisfies us most is their ability to achieve long-distance communication with minimal power. But how does its path work? To understand this, one must first understand the structure of space.</p>
<p>According to expert theories, there exists an ionized layer called the "Heaviside layer" in the upper atmosphere. This Heaviside layer has a certain thickness, as shown in the first diagram. During daytime and nighttime, the thickness of this layer and its distance from the Earth constantly change. For reference, the first diagram also includes the height at which auroras appear, the average height of meteors, the highest peak reached by Earth, and the highest records of airplanes and meteorological balloons, for comparison.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the radiation characteristics of antennas can generally be divided into low-angle radiation and high-angle radiation. The terms "low-angle" and "high-angle" refer to the angle relative to the ground. The second diagram shows the transmission state of wavelengths longer than medium waves. The antenna used is of the Marconi type. The length of the arrows in the diagram indicates the magnitude of the radiation power. The maximum radiation is almost parallel to the ground, with a very low angle, commonly known as the ground wave. As the distance increases, the radio waves are absorbed by the ground, and their power weakens.</p>
<p>However, as shown in the third diagram, the maximum radiation of a shortwave antenna has a considerable angle. Looking again at the first diagram (for convenience, the diagram is drawn as a plane, but in reality, it should be drawn as a circular arc), if radio waves are emitted from the transmitting station at several angles, during the day, because the height of the Heaviside layer is lower, the emitted radio waves only reach point A. At night, because the height of the Heaviside layer is very high, it can reflect and reach the distant point B.</p>
<p>The fourth diagram shows the intensity of the electric field. In the diagram, T represents the transmitting station. The black shadow near point X represents the intensity of the ground wave. The range of its intensity is limited to a very short distance. However, the radio waves that are refracted in the upper layer and reach the distant point form an electric field intensity in the shape of a slanted shadow, as shown by Z, which is the so-called skip distance. Point Y is the part where the radio waves do not reach, which is the so-called quiet zone. Because the height of the Heaviside layer constantly fluctuates, it is quite difficult to determine a skip distance. Therefore, it is very difficult to make radio waves emitted at the same angle reach the same location with the same sensitivity. Moreover, natural phenomena undergo various changes due to annual, seasonal, hourly, and climatic variations. Today's experts are working hard to examine these changes. It is predicted that in the near future, shortwave radio may have extraordinary effects.</p>
<h3>Trial Production of a Single-Tube Shortwave Radio</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Currently, the interest of general amateur researchers seems to be shifting towards shortwaves again, with a strong trend of abandoning longwaves and focusing on shortwave research. This has become particularly evident recently. This is because the wonders of shortwaves are captivating, and the many advantages are a major reason for their popularity. Moreover, in the current chaotic and poor broadcasting environment, those who play with broadcast radios seem to have lost interest. Instead, building a shortwave radio to receive Morse code and listen to music is novel and intriguing. However, building a shortwave radio is not easy. One must not rush into it and risk failure. Careful verification is required to achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>As shown in the diagram, this is a very perfect shortwave radio circuit, made using the latest type of dual triode-pentode vacuum tube 6F7. The pentode part is used for regenerative grid-leak detection, and the triode part is used for a single-stage transformer-coupled audio frequency amplification. Therefore, its loudness is natural and cannot be compared to forced amplification. If care is taken during production, there will be no difficulties. And its performance will definitely be superior to ordinary two-tube radios. If you don't believe me, try it.</p>
<p>All the coils in this machine are wound on a 1.4-inch diameter plug-in coil form. L is wound with No. 22 enameled wire, and L is wound with No. 30 wire. The distance between the two coils is two tenths of an inch. L needs to be wound with gaps, but the degree of the gaps depends on the number of turns of the coil. In short, no matter how many turns there are, the length of the wire plus the gaps should occupy 0.75 inches. (Thus, if the number of turns is small, the gaps must be large, and vice versa.) The number of turns for each wavelength range is listed below:</p>
<p>Wavelength (meters)   L Turns   L Turns</p>
<p>10-20   5   4</p>
<p>20-40   11   8</p>
<p>40-80   23   15</p>
<p>80-200   52   27</p>
<p>RFC plays an important role in this machine, not only stabilizing the feedback force, but also increasing the sensitivity a lot. Its inductance should not be too large, about 40MH is the most suitable.</p>
<p>The power supply for this machine is best to use AC for the A battery, and whether dry batteries or B eliminators can be used for the B battery. For B eliminator rectification, 171 half-wave rectification is sufficient. The following is a list of the various parts for completion:</p>
<p>C·0.000015 small variable capacitor</p>
<p>C1·0.00015 small variable capacitor</p>
<p>C2·0.0001 grid capacitor</p>
<p>C3 C5·0.1 MFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C4·0.0003 medium-sized variable capacitor</p>
<p>R 4 MEG</p>
<p>R1 450 ohms</p>
<p>R2 30000 ohms</p>
<p>T 3 1/2:1 low frequency transformer</p>
<p>V 6F7 vacuum tube</p>
<h3>Remedy for Audio Distortion</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>In amateur-made radios with multiple stages of amplification, if the sound is distorted (that is, the music coming from the speaker is unclear), the reason is often the poor quality of the low-frequency transformer or the excessively high amplification ratio. The remedy is very simple: just connect a variable resistor of 200,000 ohms in series between the primary (P B) of the first-stage low-frequency transformer, and then connect a 0.01 microfarad fixed capacitor between (P) and the secondary (G) (see diagram R and C). This connection is called resistance-capacitance coupling amplification. In this way, the sound quality can be greatly improved, there will be no more distortion, and R can also be used to control the tone.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign News</p>
<p>Free Repair The insurance department of Tian'er Company at No. 119 Renji Road specializes in insuring all sizes of radios. All parts inside the machine, as well as vacuum tubes, are fully covered by the insurance. If there is any damage, they are responsible for repairing or replacing it with new parts, and the premium is only 1.6 cents per day, which is extremely cheap. Moreover, the premiums paid are all collected and kept by the Trust Department of the Shanghai Bank. If any disputes arise, the Shanghai Bank is responsible for returning the full amount. The company's retail department is located at No. 141 Nanjing Road, opposite the throwing ball court, specializing in selling various old-brand radios, and is the sole agent for Tianyu No. 1 Zengnizhi brand, various radios, etc.</p>
<p>Recent News from Domestic Radio Manufacturers Zhongye Radio Factory, famous throughout the country for first manufacturing domestic speakers, has been adhering to the consistent principle of continuous improvement over the years, and has improved its products no less than dozens of times. "Zhongyong domestic parts have been praised as the standard for domestic radio parts. But taking the No. 202 speaker as an example, since its introduction to the market, it has been just over a year, and the number of sales has already exceeded ten thousand. From major cities to townships, there is almost no place where the beautiful music emitted by this speaker cannot be heard. This is because the design and selection of materials for this speaker are extremely careful. The magnetism is strong and durable, the sound is clear and loud, the style is small and exquisite, and other superior matters have reached a good state. Even the slightest detail of a wire and a cover is chosen from the most exquisite ones. It is heard that the factory, in order to make it clear to customers, has specially displayed various parts of the No. 202 speaker separately in the factory's business department at No. 598 Ningbo Road, British Concession, for reference by all circles.</p>
<p>Recent News from American Radio Company The radios of Manager Stewart of the company have long been famous. Now, to expand business, a branch office has been specially set up in Hankou to facilitate the needs of the people of Hubei Province. Those who buy radios there will feel much convenience in the future. Special News from Yada Company Yada Company at No. 24 Nanjing Road has specially set up a radio repair department. Recently, it has received letters from all walks of life requesting the company to announce which brand of radios are repaired the most and which are repaired the least each month, so as to serve as a criterion for purchasers. The company is committed to serving the community, and should answer and guide all radio-related questions as much as possible. However, with regard to announcing which radios are repaired the most and which are repaired the least, it is related to business ethics and it is difficult to comply. Moreover, the amount of repair is not really able to determine the quality of the radio. Now, in order to repay the love of all circles, the company provides an unconditional one-year warranty for any brand of radio purchased from the company, and the price is particularly low, in order to serve with loyalty. Recent News from the Great Shanghai Radio Company Anyone who has a radio damaged and entrusts it to the Great Shanghai Radio Company (telephone number 14996) for repair will definitely receive reliable and satisfactory service, because the company is quick, experienced, and well-equipped. It is by no means comparable to those who are inexperienced.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Resisting Sensual Films</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Last year, a French writer who came to China was infatuated with singing girls in Nanjing, and went mad for Beijing young ladies in the former capital. Mr. Deco Pella, who wanted to form a marriage with Chinese women, has recently been mumbling in the arms of American women. He said that there should be more passionate kissing scenes in the movie, which can make people not feel tired in the overture, can excite the audience sitting in the chair and drowsy in the play, and can add optimistic emotions to the souls of the returning audience in the finale (he calls it the eleven forty-five kiss). Let the men and women in the car realize that Clara in the arms of Penkelov has a smile. This is the benefit of movies.</p>
<p>But some people who do not help the United States came to ban sensual films, which is inevitably a scene. New York telegram said: "The Catholic Church and the Jewish Catholic Federation oppose immoral films. This movement is expanding day by day. The League of Purity has two million members. Bishop of Duggerty of Philadelphia prohibits Catholics from entering cinemas. The Jewish Catholic authorities held a meeting to prepare to boycott immoral films. The film industry was shocked when it heard the news, and has now organized a committee to inspect all films before they are released."</p>
<p>It can be said that there is no coincidence in the world. Some people think that movies are immoral and strongly oppose them, while others still shout that there should be more sensual scenes (kissing bare legs), which can make men and women intoxicated. What does this mean?</p>
<p>We see that the reason why sensual films are popular is that they develop with the advancement of the social downturn. Because those friends with microphones around their waists have been expelled in the grave. In order to seek pleasure today, they find excitement and stimulation between the breasts and thighs of movies (naturally there are many other methods); as for those workers and laborers and the hungry, most of them have almost regarded "settling down and establishing a business" as an illusion because of Mr. "Big Lai's" disapproval. In order to get close to Fangze, they have to win two hours of satisfaction on the screen. The reason why sensual films are developed at the end of this century is that some people regard watching movies as daily homework, and some "dangdangtou" to enjoy two hours, which is all this psychology. It can almost be said that the more severe the depression, the more sensual the film, and the two have become a positive proportion.</p>
<p>This audience's psychology has created the "sensual" speculation of film producers; and to be honest, it has also created a certain purpose for stars to try their best to be "wild" and "浪". The former's performance is to pull and pull the star's bath as a selling point, and the latter hopes to use the sacrificed color phase under the mercury lamp to exchange for "gossip" bungalows and cars at a certain time. All of this is seen as an enviable career, and it is also a reflection of the end of the century.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the reason why the movie is "sensual" and "immoral" is that the society everywhere is a sensual and immoral society. In such a society that is increasingly sinking, if you want the film not to be sensual and not to be immoral, it is far from being able to be done by Catholics banning entering cinemas, or by "League of Purity" resisting. As for the film industry, which is full of gold pounds and gold dollars, organizing a committee to inspect is a deaf ear, without any doubt.</p>
<p>If you ask why today's movies have to lure people with sensuality, needless to say, our Chinese sleepy eyes run into the movie theater, old masters, old ladies, young masters, and young ladies, their interest in "sensuality," and Deco Pella, who is in the midst of social distress, are all intoxicated with women's sensuality and kisses, which has already shown its "going without saying" and its having to fall.</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Wen Gai</p>
<p>Young people like to talk about love, middle-aged people like to talk about sex. Young people ask for a sexual relationship by talking about love, and middle-aged people ask for a guarantee of love by a sexual relationship. (Men and women are the same, without distinction.)</p>
<p>Young people who like to talk about love. His view of love is supremacy, middle-aged people who like to talk about sex, his view of love is obligation.</p>
<p>Everyone in the current era cannot avoid experiencing first love once, but there is no such thing as experiencing it a second time.</p>
<p>Those who are supremacy in love are willing to carry the cross, and ordinary love feels painful. Those who are obligation in love like ordinary love, if they encounter the supremacy in love, he is forced to the cross.</p>
<p>People who are passionate about love are also passionate about their careers; however, people who are passionate about their careers are not necessarily passionate about love.</p>
<p>People with enthusiasm are easily deceived by artificial people, and people without enthusiasm are often called people to be deceived by him.</p>
<p>People who do not think of obligation in love, when they think of obligation, he does not fall in love.</p>
<p>Men like love before "marriage", women like love after "marriage".</p>
<p>An honest wife is deceived by her husband, and an honest husband is also deceived by his wife.</p>
<h3>Talking About Making Friends</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>With the exception of a very few. People have the endowment to seek mates, not only to seek mates, but also to seek friends and to be gregarious. This, I think, probably no one can deny it.</p>
<p>The vastness of the universe and the loneliness of life, relying solely on one's own "joy of life", wanting to gain a lot of comfort on the road of life, is naturally impossible.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must chase after the opposite sex, and after chasing them, we must not be afraid of trivialities and pain, and we must have children, the purpose is to "reunite". We must also look for friends of the same or opposite sex, communicate frequently, and have good correspondence. The joy of friends is as if it is our own joy, and the difficulties of friends are as if it is our own difficulties, the purpose is to expand the field of life, although it is not necessary to be reunited without interruption from morning to night.</p>
<p>In this way, human life can be enriched, can be rich, and can add color and color. In this way, human beings can truly have the joy of life, the love of life, and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>On the contrary, people who do not have close friends must only feel the loneliness of life, the dimness of the universe, and the coldness of society. The reason is that the lack of joy of life is not enough to irrigate their souls, and their lives are naturally narrow. I dare to assert that this kind of person, no matter how learned he is, no matter how rich he is, must be the most painful person in the world. Sparrows chirp and jump on the window sill; ants crawl and walk in rows at the feet. Does he not see it and feel a strange unease? Unless he is a wooden stone, he simply has no senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very clear that we want friends, and it does not matter</p>
<p>There are just many people in the world. Because</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>of their stubborn nature and lack of the dragon power to attract others, they end up being lonely and unhappy, but they do not know how to use their innate wisdom to cultivate acquired abilities to pursue the crowded people.</p>
<p>So, how do we make friends? The best way is to offer your heart with the most sincere loyalty, treat others with concern, show special interest in other people's affairs, and this concern and interest must come from "nature", otherwise others will scoff at you as being pretentious and hypocritical.</p>
<p>Secondly, one must be generous, and people in the world like people with a wide heart. Anyone who is "generous" is welcomed everywhere.</p>
<h3>Night River Tour in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>On the banks of Bai'etan, on the banks of the Pearl River. I invited three friends to stroll around and stroll along Changdi.</p>
<p>At dusk, the heat has dropped from over 100 degrees to 80 degrees. In Changdi, the bustling Xihoukou, the busy Haizhu Front, and the ten thousand people gathered at the Qiu Jiang Bridge abutment... There, most of the people there are local people of "diu na ma", only our four "ta ma de" "foreign Jiang Lao" are mixed in.</p>
<p>A gust of cool breeze blows from the Pearl River, carrying the clear warbling sound of the danjia girls "Calling for boats, river tours!"</p>
<h3>文凴與飯碗</h3>
<p>— One – The moon rises, its reflection in the river. It truly does not betray the praise of the literati and refined scholars of yesteryear for one of the Eight Sights of Guangzhou: "Pearl River Flowing with Night Moon"! It is a pity, however, that the "Copper Water Clock Drips" has met with misfortune and been dismantled. Otherwise, we could still hear the dripping sound. It is about nine o'clock. A shabbily dressed "Dan" (boat-dwelling) girl with a swaying gait comes running: "Foreigner, river cruise? See prostitutes?" she says. Indeed, we are enticed, perhaps we have long had this intention. So we follow her swaying buttocks to her "sand boat." Sand boats are perhaps unique to Guangzhou. Although the construction of sand boats is similar to ordinary rowing boats, their interior layout is extraordinary. In the cabin, only a few feet wide, pearl lamps are festooned, colorful and unusually luxurious. It can serve as a living room for learned scholars to converse and laugh. And I know it can also be a place for secret activities. "Foreigner, where to cruise? Ghost Shed Tail, or Dashatou?" the Dan girl, rocking the creaking oars, asks us. So we decide to cruise to Dashatou. The flower streets and willow lanes on the river are also a unique sight in Guangzhou. Here, the prostitute boats are displayed on the river, row upon row, like streets and alleys. The prostitutes sit in rows in front of the boats, allowing people to feast their eyes. Oh, they are not just exhibits, but also commodities for sale. They sit in front of the boats, flashing their soul-stirring, bewitching eyes, to attract customers! By paying a donation of four yuan and six dimes and a bride-price of five "kan," one can buy her for a night of embrace, a night of revelry. I really want to call a prostitute to comfort my dry heart as a wanderer in a foreign land. But I am afraid, afraid of contracting venereal disease, and even more afraid of leprosy. Leprosy is still prevalent in Guangzhou, especially among the Dan prostitute girls. So Guangzhou people often sing a folk song: "It's your turn, it's your turn! Leprosy worms donate so randomly. Buy a cheap boat, buy a cheap boat..." This song is a warning from lepers to the world. It is already late at night. My mind and body are indeed much more comfortable. All the hot demons that had been holding us back have fled because of the river cruise. This is the happiness bestowed by the river cruise. When we are about to go ashore, the Dan girl's enchanting eyes stare at me as if preoccupied with something. And her melodious voice gently begs us to stay overnight. Then she whispers in my ear: "Spend the night here, there's 'boat heart,' guaranteed you'll be satisfied!" "Um, don't come at me!" I reply to her in Cantonese. So the four of us step away from the mysterious sand boat and jump onto the pier. Feeling refreshed, we slowly walk home. In the distance, the sound of bamboo clappers calling out "fish congee for sale" is heard. This is truly a heart-wrenching thing! Wen Bing Early in the morning, I receive a letter from Peng. I quickly open it and see, alas, what terrible news! "I received a letter from Liang Chou, saying that your good friend Yang Wu has died of illness in ×× city, and asking me to quickly inform you." Yang Wu is one of my most beloved friends in my life! I think, if everyone in the world had met him, had talked to him in depth, had corresponded with him, then everyone would have an infinite respect and love for him, just as I do for him. This, I have a certainty, is that among my friends, all those who know him express respect and love for him. Originally, in today's society, so-called intimate friendships, so-called beloved good friends, cannot escape "interest relationships" and "utilitarian relationships." Everyone respects and loves those who are rich and powerful, or, even if they are neither rich nor powerful, they still respect each other, then it cannot escape mutual exploitation, and there are always these two kinds of polluting threads in between, so that they can communicate and be friendly with each other. Dear readers, please try to think quietly. Who can escape this trap in this muddled society? Where can so-called loyal and pure friendship be found? However, the reason why I respect and love Yang Wu is that I am very fortunate that I have not been caught in any of the above-mentioned traps in this polluting society. It must have been the spring two years ago. At that time, the "Shanghai War" had just ended. Dong Lin gave me a letter, saying that he was introducing a friend to me. Naturally, that was my now-mourned late friend Yang Wu. Before long, we started corresponding before we even met, and it has been more than two years now. From our correspondence to our acquaintance, from our acquaintance to the present, although the time has not been long, it has been more than two years. During this time, we only had loyal and pure fabrications. of exchanges, without any interest or exploitation in the fabrication. As usual, we should not be able to get rid of the general baseness, because in our union, there is a form of interest, and there is an opportunity for exploitation. He, Yang Wu, is a political activist, while I am just an incompetent and frustrated literati. However, we really did not have any interactions based on interest or exploitation. He had been to ×× city once. But he never asked me to help him with anything necessary, and I would not want to cling to him because I was suffering from drifting around. Later, in Nanjing, we also had time to meet and talk. At this time, he was living in a high-rise building, in the mansion of a so-called important person, but he still maintained our loyal and pure friendship. However, we were indeed very close, very compatible and harmonious. When we met, we talked about current affairs and commented on people as we pleased, truly forgetting gains and losses, without the slightest bit of estrangement. Like this, until now, until Yang Wu said goodbye to the world forever, I respect and love him. He is one of the most beloved people in my life, a good friend! Although he is a person on the political stage, he is so passionate, generous, frank, and forthright, without a trace of cunning, hypocrisy, insidiousness, or espionage. It is precisely because he is such a person that the vile current society cannot accommodate him after all. His ten years of political struggle have been declining day by day. Gradually, there is no possibility for his development. He has become a background figure in politics, insignificantly clinging to ×× city. It is precisely because he is such a person that he does not know how to cherish his body or plan his future. Two years ago, the doctor had already proved that he was suffering from tuberculosis, but he still did not know how to rest, and still ran around day and night, still endlessly indulging in the arms of his beloved wife. Although we gave him loyal and straightforward advice, asking him to recuperate as soon as possible, he would not listen. Yang Wu, your death is indeed within my expectations. However, how much do I mourn for you? Your great personality has not yet illuminated the world, your great cause has not yet been established to save the world? How can I not mourn!</p>

<p>Summer Fishing Song Yafei Xiaxia Bay is one of the famous scenic spots in my hometown, and the only summer resort in my hometown; although it is not as famous as Mount Lu, Kuling, Mogan Mountain, and Laoshan, and there are not often important people and celebrities going there to escape the summer heat, it also has the lovable scenery like Mount Lu and Mogan Mountain; towering green mountains, beautiful green waters, it is as quiet as a virgin, as gentle as a young girl. Indeed, the impression that Xiaxia Bay gives me will never be forgotten. Although, since I ran into the city and mixed into the crowd of life, it has been almost three whole years since I returned to my old place once; however, in my memory, it still seems to have a clear shadow. Long time no see, Xiaxia Bay! It is still so lovable, still so worthy of people's nostalgia! Xiaxia Bay, this is a small fishing village; it is said that King Wu and Xi Shi once escaped the summer heat here, and there are still many anecdotal stories left behind for people to observe and talk about. The name "Summer Fishing Song" must have been set at this time, and there is also a general record of this fact in the "Eight Views of Dongting". To the east of the bay, about a thousand miles away, is Yuqi Peak; it is said that in the past, when King Yu of Xia controlled the flood, he used to meet and negotiate on this Yuqi Peak. There, once summer arrives, the pond is covered with green lotus leaves like a canopy, interspersed with pink and charming water lilies, water shields sprout tender buds in the shape of shuttles, and delicate white water caltrops sway in the wind. Cattails on the edge of the pond stand up like a pregnant woman's belly. On the water surface, there are leaves-shaped flat boats and buckets for picking water caltrops. Many fishermen children and girls leisurely pick water caltrops, pluck water shields, and climb cattails; on one side, they sing familiar fishing songs. Sent to the shore by the wind, flying around the pond, it sounds so good. Although the melodious tone and graceful rhythm do not have the rhythm of拍子 (time signature) or the harmony of梵華鈴 (a kind of bell) and 披霞娜 (an Indian stringed instrument), they are much more superior and self-forged than the licentious songs such as "Peach Blossom River is a Beauty's Nest"! I remember it was three years ago! Mei and I also had such a day; but, it has now become a momentary dream at that time. This beautiful dream! Now there will never be such a day again; even, in the distant future, there may not be such a day coming; a dream is just a dream after all! In the early morning of the end of summer, the gentleness brought by the morning breeze excited the emotions of us two; she and I ran to the riverbank, untied the cable on the small boat, she rowed the oars, and I helped to punt, the small boat finally gradually left the shore and moved towards the endless lotus pond, rocking, swaying, the swing of the oar, sprinkled beautiful water flowers, the breeze blew, rippling scales of ripples. In the pond, the cattails and reeds on the side of the boat just kept nodding to us, the rootless duckweed floated on the surface and drifted, the green willows on the embankment danced in the breeze, and the dotted sails all moved forward towards the distant misty waves. All these embellishments woven together a natural picture; as for Mei and I, we naturally became people in the painting. Happy! Let's be happy! This kind of life, this kind of environment; how do you know what things in the human world are painful? She was so excited that she went crazy, she threw herself into my arms, hooked my neck with her left hand, patted my shoulder with her right hand and said; ——Yun! I'll sing a song, will you clap for me? ——Very good! Come on, I love to hear your mountain songs! "Clap! Clap! Clap!" I said, hitting my palms. Finally, she opened her sharp voice and sang. ——The little boat has two upturned ends, the sister is rowing the oars and the man is punting; row the boat to the heart of the river, the man casts the net and the sister controls the stern······· ——What a good sister, not afraid of being embarrassed. I hugged her slender waist and gave her a deep kiss, she blushed, twisted on her thigh, broke free from my hand, and glared at me hatefully; the singing also stopped. Passing through the lotus pond, tie the boat to the side of the reeds; she jumped into the big bucket, rowed away, rowed to the water caltrop trees; turning over each water caltrop seedling. After a while, she carried half a bucket of fresh water caltrops and a bundle of lotus pods and rowed back to the boat. We moved the boat under the shade of the green willows, eating, talking, and laughing; she peeled one and sent one to my mouth. ——Mei! This mountain, this water, how lovable! I really don't want to leave here; I hope to be with you forever, Mei! Will you agree to my request? I stirred the water by the side of the boat and said to her enthusiastically. But she replied to me agitatedly: ——That's right, I think so too, but you have your great future, this kind of mountain and water fun, pastoral interest, is certainly good; however, it cannot bury our future, eliminate our ambitions! Yun! Don't always think like this! ——Yes, we certainly can't just seek ease and enjoy pleasure; we must find a life that is more meaningful than a more realistic life, but, the flame of my life is burning! Mei! You should give me a shower of rain, right? I have my youth, youth is precious, Mei! Are you willing to have your youth disappear without any value? ——Ah! Life! Youth!············ She became silent. The environment dominated my reality, a bad reality! Fate decided my future, a terrifying future! I finally ran to the city to pursue a vagrant-style life! Now, I no longer reminisce about these dreams, I only step on the vast road ahead to yearn for the future, the ideal life. Amateur Mailbox Same Surname, Same Clan Editor Editor: I now have a question, please give me some guidance, I think you will definitely allow me, right! When I was studying in the countryside when I was young, a female classmate had very good feelings for me. It has been more than four years since I came to Shanghai, and she often writes to me, and is even more intimate than before. She graduated from elementary school and is a woman with new ideas. Recently, she has been talking to me about marriage in her letters, but she and I have the same surname and the same clan, reporter, I don't know if I can get engaged to her? Please answer me and wish you a good day Cheng He bows his head Answer: In the traditional customs of our country, people with the same surname do not marry, and it goes without saying that people with the same clan are even more impossible. But this traditional creed has no scientific basis. Now, eugenicists often attack it. Even in the current laws, the restrictions on consanguineous marriage are narrower than before. Except for direct blood relatives and direct in-laws who are prohibited from marrying, there are no restrictions on collateral blood relatives beyond eight degrees of kinship, so if your female classmate is very distantly related, and is already beyond the fifth generation, then marriage is not a problem. Correction There were many errors in the second section of "Revenge" published on the 17th of this month, and we now correct them as follows: Line 2: Still "living" the word "living" is a mistake for the word "sitting". Line 4: "Just" know is "I" know. Line 5: "Welcome!" is "You?" Line 10: I thought of a "supplement"... is I thought of a "kind"... Line 11: Terrible "hot" is terrible "of". Line 13: "Qi" threatened, is "Wei" threatened. Line 20: Very "press" ground, is very "fast" ground. Line 25: Naughty "suddenly" stood up, is naughty "laughed" up. Line 27: "Right" gulch, is "swallowed" up, ......</p>
