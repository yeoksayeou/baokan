<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國之國防問題恒</h3>
<p>世界二次大戰之難以倖免。至今日趨明顯。而我國之勢必牽入漩渦。亦不待龜筮而可知。設我國而不及時奮發。以謀國防之建設。則他日事變爆發。不獨談不到國際情勢之利用與東北之收回。卽欲求一局外之中立。亦必不可得也。故其結果。在我唯有一任他人之犯我疆土。侵我富源。以我國境爲戰塲。無論何方勝利。於我必無好處。反之。我國若已有國防之建設。則自積極方面言。大可因勢乘便。利用國際之變化。以爲他日圖强進取之張本。自消極方面言。亦可嚴守局外之中立。免淪國土於異族。國於今日。欲求確保領土主權之完整。旣不受一國之宰制。亦不爲列國所瓜分。唯有充實有自衛之力量。舍此必無他道可求也。因就管見。略言今後國防建設之要端。</p>
<p>一曰。開闢交通。　九一八後。我國軍隊於熱河長城淞滬一帶。皆曾有相當之抵抗。然終不免於失敗者。原因雖不一端。而交通之不靈便。補充之不迅速。實爲致命傷。年來政府努力發展公路。似爲補救此一缺陷之捷徑。然公路雖不妨設法多築。特其效用究屬有限。爲開發中國之經濟資源計。爲未來之國防計。鐵路之積極增築。實不容緩。蓋公路雖有用。鐵路用更大。公路僅爲國家之微血管。而鐵路則爲國家之大動脈。不能以公路之輕而易舉。鐵路之需費浩大。而有所軒輊也。</p>
<p>二曰。發展重工業　生産發展之國家。戰勝生産落後之民族。已成近代國際戰爭之鐵律。産業界中與國防關係最爲密切者。厥爲重工業。蘇俄之五年計劃。所以成爲國防計劃者。以其所發展之工業爲重工業故也。德國國防實力。遠不如法。然一至德國要求軍備平等。法國卽行惶駭者。以德國爲一重工業發達之國家耳。上次大戰時。交戰各國每日彈藥所費達一千九百萬美金之鉅。相持四年。尙未匱乏者。以交戰國皆有雄厚之重工業故也。而俄國之所以失敗而革命。亦坐於工業之發展。未如歐西各國耳。故近世戰爭。若無重工業爲之基礎。則其敗北。可以預决。我國現時所以含垢忍辱。不能與日本較一日之長者。亦坐於是。此我國爲應付來日大難所當深切注意者也。</p>
<p>三曰。建設兵工廠飛機製造廠造船廠。重工業發展之後。在平時可以補軍需工業之不足。戰時卽其自身亦可改爲軍需工業。歐戰之時。各國無不如此應付。然於平時。兩者各有使命。不能混同。故兵工廠飛機廠造船廠。仍有特設之必要。我國現有之兵工廠。雖有數所。造船廠亦有一二。然設備簡陋。殊不足以言自給。一旦國際戰爭爆發。來源斷絶。卽有束手待斃之虞。至於飛機。則純仰國外供給。未來大戰。取决於空戰。我國若不早謀自給。將何以應付未來之鉅艱。洵堪憂慮。凡此數種軍需工業。必須及早建設。以免有噬臍之嘆也。四曰。化兵爲民與化民爲兵　我國以兵我稱於世。而國未强。瑞士一蕞爾小國。平時有兵僅五百人。而歐洲之强國。未敢向之侵犯。其故何在。蓋我國有兵二百萬。則僅二百萬。而瑞士則除平時之五百人外。猶有六十萬龐大之預備隊。瑞士人口共四百萬。而其實際之戰鬥員。達六十萬。佔全人口百分之一五·五。我國人口四萬萬。而實際之戰鬥員。僅有二百萬。佔全人口百分之·四五。以比例言。戰鬥員較瑞士少三十餘倍。安得不遭人之輕視。他如蘇俄預備員有一千五百萬。法國預備員有六百三十三萬。意大利有預備員六百萬。而其常備兵數額。則皆不如我國遠甚。於此可知國防之道。不在平時之兵多。而在預備員之衆多。設竭一國之力以養兵。及至戰時而感覺不足。則無寗平時兵少。戰時兵多之爲愈也。年來當局對於軍訓。頗爲注意。其意顯欲養成預備員。然範圍限於學生。則取才似乎過少矣。蓋按照瑞士之比例。我國須有六千五百萬之預備員。設僅限於學生。何濟於事耶。故此點希望當局擴大範圍。以期達全民皆兵之目的。至於現時我國之軍隊。一待剿匪告成之後。卽應設法使之逐漸歸農歸工。以助國家之建設。聞蔣委員長已有裁减國軍至五十師之計劃。若此一計劃能告成功。則大部兵士。皆可重化爲民。旣可輕國庫之負擔。又可助國家之生産。同時又能使政府傾其全力於國防軍備之建設。爲計之得。莫過於是。唯我人認爲須加注意者。卽兵士未裁之先。必使其有一技之長。最好有一固定工作。然後加以裁撤。否則所謂裁兵。無異驅之挺而走險。殊非化兵爲民之善法也。</p>
<p>以上四點。舉辦非易。决非一年二年所能成就。然及早預備。及早着手。則必較不預備不着手爲愈。設世界大戰在一二年内不爆發。或竟延至十數年後始爆發。則我之預備。必能充足可觀。有恃無恐。設短期間内而卽爆發。則我亦有相當之準備。必勝於全無把握也。</p>

<h3>日岡田談話激起美國反響</h3>
<p>認爲不着邊際</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本首相岡田昨於組閣後初次接見外國記者、發表談話、建議由軍備最强之國家、先事裁减海軍實力云云、此間並無何種反響、官塲方面　以爲岡田談話中最可樂觀之一點、卽爲岡田本身係海軍上將、對於海軍深表同情、竟亦言及裁軍、蓋向來日本人所發表之意見、皆贊成擴充海軍也、惟岡田所謂軍備　最强之國家、未知究指何國、據多數外交界及政府方面人員之意、日本本身之海軍、較之英美二國尤爲充實也、故美國海軍當局决不願以美國艦隊减至日本相等　之實力、美國海軍專家視美國現在艦隊、在戰略上實已與日本相等、因美國之海岸綫長、而領土遠及海外、故主力艦數雖多、實際上並不佔優勢、英國亦然、岡田之言、雖非常謙和、惟完全不着邊際、故儘可加以種種解釋也、（三十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　華盛頓外交界、今日對於英國代理首相鮑爾溫昨在下院之言論、認爲在國際間非常重要、鮑氏之言、可代表世界政治家在已往十年中共有之思想、卽空軍所防禦之邊境、當遠在一國政治邊境之外也、共和黨參議員賓漢宣稱、自歐洲國家空軍實力露布之後、美國對於航空母艦及飛甲板巡艦之需要、更爲殷切、民主黨參議員麥加度亦稱、美國亦如英國、應有在海岸以外之適當防綫、而以檀香山爲尤甚、應在海陸空三面加緊防禦、至大西洋方面、則美國之安全、以歐洲航空發達、深受威脅、故麥氏主張西印度羣島須全懸美旗云、外交界以爲鮑爾溫之言論、可使英法邦交益形鞏固、因鮑氏曾謂中歐國家、如對於法國有所不利、英法空軍當合力抗拒、而以萊茵河爲邊界、若干外交界、則以爲鮑氏之言、無異爲日本張目、蓋東京方面向來之主張、卽爲日本在滿洲之行動、爲擴充國防至實際國境之外也、惟應注意者、爲英法合作之空軍防綫、對方有一假想敵人、而日本在滿洲則惟一意孤行、其國防竟擴充至一中立及友好國家境内、爲可異耳、（三十一日國民電）</p>

。　　Ｃ國家民族主義下的社會之道德　天下主義的道德，在天下主義思想中發達出來的，自然祗適合於天下主義下之社會的需要。在這種主義之下，對於四夷，多是採用和平信義仁愛的感化政策，好像漢初與匈奴，唐初與吐蕃的和親辦法，又如諸葛武侯七擒七縱孟獲的辦法天都是天下主義的結晶。換言之，就是用王道來統一天下，或統治天下，但是，這種道德，若是在民族國家相對抗，而鬥爭劇烈的時代中來講，恐怕自已的主張還没有實行，自已國家的生命，便已斷送了。例如：宋襄公在與强敵陳兵相見的時候，他講「君子不動傷，不禽二毛」的主義，在那國家主義的社會，就未免婦人之仁。所以結果泓水之役，弄得自已大上其當。所以説在民族國家主義之下來講大同，固然談不到，就講天下主義，也不合乎他的國家民族的利益。　　我們現在社會的本身，還是在家族主義支配之下，同時又有外國和我們對立，而且我國之富强，遠不如人，一切文化科學，都形落後，在國際上，還算最倒霉的一國，時代環境，都已進到了國家民族主義的一階段，四圍的民族國家，都　隣虎視，挾其優勢，咄咄逼人。時間空間都已證明我們所處的社會，確是民族國家主義下的社會，並不是天下主義的社會，尤不容我們徘徊苟安於家族主義的社會。數千年來所講的父慈子孝，兄愛弟敬，君明臣忠，夫和婦順，朋友有信，説來説去，不過是私德的範圍。現在的環境，却已超過家族主義的階段，進到民族國家主義的階段，所需要的道德是公德，尤其是國族主義下之「禮義廉恥」的公德。若是發呆地來講天下主義，已是一種空想，痛大同主義尤是荒謬，固執地講家族主義而不知隨時代而邁進，則又是開倒車。　　我們要知道一種道德，是由時代環境而産生的，並且隨時代環境而變動的，當然於時代環境有密切的關係。例如：南洋羣島的野蠻人，和我國大山裏頭的苗人，他們最尊崇的美德，就是尙勇武。那個男子殺的人頭多，或是身上的傷痕多，便受社會的尊崇，女人也就很願意的爭住嫁給他。他們爲什麽要如此，就是因爲他們在他們那環境中，一方要抵抗外面文明人的壓迫，一方要和境内的野獸爭生存，都非有勇武的精神不可。而他們之所以能够延續到今日，也就是全靠有這種適合於環境需要的勇武的美德。再從中國歷史來看：趙武靈王在北方，與匈奴逼處，常受胡人的威脅，他就敎官民胡服騎射，講究勇开，以胡人之道，來抵抗胡人，因爲在那個環境中，非提倡武德，便有被滅亡的危險。又如漢光武的時候，適當王莽篡位之後，當王莽居攝之時，一般士大夫如揚雄這班人還替他歌功頌德。獻符勸進者，徧於天下，弄得一點廉恥都没有，風氣之壞，無以復加。所以當光武中興之後，他便極力提倡氣節，綜核名實，蓋非如此，國家社會，不能補偏救弊　，便不能維持。　　當春秋之世，羣雄割據，成功了許多國家，都汲汲於富國强兵，互相吞併。在這時候，國家主義在事實上已很發達，如果謀國不臧的話，隨時都有被他强吞併的可能。在當時歷史演進之中，就出了一個最聰明的政治家管仲其人，他很瞭解當時齊國的利弊，知道非提倡一種國家主義的美德來培養國民的國家意識，發揚國民的國家精神不可。所以他以「禮義廉恥」爲國民倡，他説：「禮義廉恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃滅亡。」他不説「孝弟忠信」國之四維，而説「禮義廉恥」國之四維，他很知道「孝弟忠信」祗合於家族主義的社會之需要，「禮義廉恥」纔合乎國家主義的社會之需要，可謂目光如炬，能見其大，他把四維爲立國之精神，所以齊國從此一天一天的强盛起來，終能成就齊桓公的覇業。　　中國現在所處之時代與環境，較之管仲所相之齊國尤爲危急，欲拯救中國，自非就中國種種固有道德之中，特别倡導「禮義廉恥」不可。我們提倡「禮義廉恥」，並非掛一漏萬，更非顧此失彼，我們要於家族主義的道德基礎之上，加工造成一種國族主義的道德。要從畸形發達的私德之外，加工造成一種平均發達的公德。我們對於中國一切固有的美德，無論是根於家族主義的，或是根於天下主義的，不但不蔑视不摧毁，而且照常的尊重與維持。不過我們對於最合時代環境需要的公德，對於本爲中國所固有而現在極不發達的公德，所謂「禮義廉恥」，不能不特别提倡，加緊厲行，使之死而復甦，枯而復榮罷了。　　第二、禮義廉恥雖是中國固有的社會公德之一種，然實屬平淡無奇而久服無效的古方，並非舶來品的特效藥，中國病情複雜得很，可以拿這個古方當做救國萬應靈丹嗎？　　解答這個問題，至少應分作三部分研究，現在我把個人研究的結果，分别説説：　　（一）「禮義廉恥確是中國有名的古方，然已往的中國，曾否照方服藥，如果藥是服了，並不是用這個方，或是偶然兼採這個方，而任意加减，以爲别個主方之助，那不能斷定這個古方爲無效」，這是第一解答，因爲禮義廉恥在中國道德發達史中，確是恰如這個比方的情形。數千年來中國的社會，賴禮義廉恥的維持，是普通的需要，並不是特别的需要，禮義廉恥在中國一般固有道德之中，也没有占着很優遇很崇高的地位，甚至他看作别的私公德德中一種子目條項，漸漸的失其獨立性的作用。他的一生就是遇着一個管仲，奉之如神明，是他唯一的知已，其餘諸人，雖是口聲聲恭維他，却没有誠誠懇懇的去請敎他，這是「禮義廉恥」生不逢時的厄運。究厥原因，不外下列的幾種：　　一·禮義廉恥是國家民族主義下的社會之道德，中國自古迄今還脱離不了家族主義的社會，同時又是大一統的中國，所以同是天下主義的社會，在這種環境認識之下，當然的理想，便爲家族主義和天下主義的道德，所謂國家主義的道德，當然無從確立，我前面已經詳細説過，用不着贅説了。　　二·禮義廉恥是對國家對社會的公德，而國家社會都是無形無聲的東西，是一種法人而非自然人，我國人向來只知道自然人的關係，根本就没有法人的觀念。現在民族國家主義下最流行最需要的就是法人的觀念。外國人重視法人，所以愛國家愛民族之心，遠出乎愛家族之心上，而我們的先哲，却没有法人的觀念，不知道國家是一個法人，也和一個人一樣的。所以看社會國家，不過是一種空洞的名詞，不知道怎樣直接對他負責任，只知道對於自然人中之人與人間的關係，講究得很圓滿。如父慈子孝，夫和婦順，兄愛弟敬，君明臣忠，朋友有信，這些私德，發揮得很透澈，很知道互相的盡義務責任，却不知道國家民族爲一個無形的法人，也應該對他直接負責任負義務。以爲「君」是國家的代表，「國」是「君」的私産，祗知忠君，不知忠於國，祗知效忠於特定的自然人，而不知效忠於公共的法人。因爲旣不明白法人的道理，不知道對公法人私法人應守的道德，所以我國人對於公共團體或商業公司的組織，都是很糟糕。例如這幾十年各地所組織的股份公司，這些做經理董事的人，多是各人打各人的如意算盤，以爲無形無聲的法人，　比自然人更容易欺騙，都是損公益已，非弄到公司倒閉不可。尤其是對於公共轉體的國家，毫無責任心。辦公事則因循泄沓，用公欵則浪費自肥，總以個人家族爲立塲，視公家如無物。所以法人的觀念旣不存在，民族國家的意識，當然無從發達。民族國家主義下所最需要的道德，所謂禮義廉恥，也就當然無從發達。　　三·宋儒以後誤解孔孟之學説，以爲修身齊家便是治國平天下，以爲有了修身齊家的本領，便有了治國平天下的本領。他們聚精會神，説來説去的多是家族主義的私德範圍。他們始終以爲「人人親其親，長其長，而天下平」，始終認定「老吾老，以及人之老，幼吾幼，以及人之幼，則天下可運諸掌上」，他不知道除私德外，還應直接爲國家爲民族特别養成一種公德。　　四·宋儒以後，不但過於偏重私德，而且常把這種「禮義廉恥」之公德，也扯到家族主義的私德上面去，替他裝飾點綴，以助成私德畸形的發達。例如：他們要注重五倫關係之莊嚴，就弄出種種具體的形式，把吉，凶，軍，賓，嘉，的五禮，分門别類，定出了很複雜的繁文縟節。又如他們要極力提倡臣之忠，婦之貞，就充分發揮禮義廉恥之精神，説餓死事小，失節事大，諸如此類，漸漸失了禮義廉恥的獨立作用，所以現在講新文化的人，便説這是吃人的禮敎。　　以上四種關係，都是禮義謙恥在中國社會，不能十分發達的原因。所以禮義廉恥被人重視的程度，不但趕不上家族主義之孝弟忠信，也趕不上天下主義之仁愛和平。這個古方，旣未重用，當然不能説是久服無效。　　（二）「禮義廉恥確是中國固有的古方，不是外國發明的特效藥，可是在現代轼家主義下的東西洋各國，他們維持社會的通用良藥，化分起來，其中含了禮義廉恥的成分就不少，外國無此方而有此藥，則中國這個古方，更值得重視」。這是第二個解答，到底正確不正確呢？　　委員長蔣先生常説：外國人不講禮義廉恥，而他們日常生活，却合乎禮廉恥；反之，我們講禮養廉恥，反不能實行，這是最的確的情形。外國並没有把禮義廉恥連綴而成一個名詞，更不知道禮義廉恥連環而生的作用，可是外國人的私生活公生活，無論持躬待人接物處事，無論食衣住行，都很合乎義禮廉恥的道理。例如：我們同外國朋友一見，便免冠爲禮，握手爲親，還要請一聲Good　morning!如果隔了两天見面，便問一聲How　do　you　do?又如吃飯的時候，雖只是自已一家人，没有賓客，他們還是鄭重其事，整好衣服，梳好頭髮，才入座就餐。此外如穿衣，行路，乘車，坐船，或是入塲集會，都有很好禮節禮讓，都很能整齊靜肅。對於義字，也特别注重。例如竊盜侵入鄰舍偷東西，或是綁匪綁票，在我國人視之，多取隔岸觀火的態度，不敢聲張，以爲與已無關，而且恐怕匪盜反爲已害。外國人就不然，遇着這些事情，他一定要本互助除惡的精神，非開槍打他，就出去代爲報警。所以上海的綁票案，從來没有敢輪到租界的外國人頭上來，也不爲無因。在外國人貪污的事體，雖然不免，可是總比較我們中國人清明得多，試看我國海關中所用的外國人，雖然不能説是弊絶風清，可是和我國别的征收官吏比較起來，就在天淵之别，祗照普通情形而論，外國公務人員於取予之間，總比較的嚴格，總不敢太隨便。再講到恥字，如西班牙决鬥的精神，就很可以表現出來。甲不滿於乙，如表示要和乙决鬥，乙即决不肯怕死退縮，就約到郊外彼此對槍。外國人受了恥辱之後，或是不能達到他的使命，往往自殺，不願偷生。日本人的私德。比較中國差得多，並且有殘酷好戰擾亂和平的素性，可是日本社會的公德方面，不能説他們不知道禮義廉恥。無論穿衣吃飯應對進退，都是繁文縟節，所講的禮法，還嫌過火，如果撇開公誼講私交，和他們做朋友，也很能緩急相濟，守望相助，疾病相扶持，尤喜歡打不平，大概他們的度量，非常之小，一受恥辱，便至切腹自殺，大有士可殺不可辱的精神。我國人的度量，便大不相同了。受了别人的污辱，並不覺得了不起，還要自相慰藉地説唾面自乾，或是忍辱負重，逆來順受，拿這一類好聽的語調，來掩護自已的面子，同時社會上的人，也佩服他豁達大度，讚美他的道德。　　要而言之，東西各國的人和我們中國人相比，他們對國家總較有責任心，對社便較有同情心，他們辦事都較爲認眞，他們積下來的財産拿來輸將國家救濟社會的就不少，他們多能重秩序，守紀律，講是非，知羞惡，他們的公生活私生活，都頗合乎禮義廉恥的道理，是外國有此藥而無此方，我國雖有了這個古方，却是並没有好好的配製這個藥，更從來没有重重的服用這類藥。（未完）松江水巡隊迭破要案　　農村破産、社會經濟枯竭、四鄉匪盜蠭起、雖經水陸公安機關偵緝、鮮有破獲、惟近日水巡獨立分隊長費公俠、破獲奉邑巨匪尹小妹、及金山衛扇子形倪姓綁匪張照根等三名　及營救肉票出險、迭破要案、匪膽當爲稍寒、兹悉該隊班長唐書琴等、前日在賣花橋一帶游巡、查見該處泊有江北船一般、形跡殊爲可疑、登船搜獲手槍一枝、及籐鐲等物、顯非正當、即將船户候麻子夫婦及十歲小孩阿狗三名口（江北人）逮捕、盤詰據稱、曾犯行刦十三圖王福春家、並擊斃事主之子少春不諱、刻將人證解回隊部、轉解縣政府發落、青浦城廂發現眞性霍亂　　本城入夏以來、天氣酷熱、患病者甚多、惟皆屬慢急性腸胃炎中署等症、故人心尙覺安定、詎於昨日下午三時許、本城三角街德大棉布莊股東馮虞眞之妻沈蟾芬、（三十八歲）忽罹眞性霍亂、初則吐瀉、繼則眼陷羅　、雖經本埠有名西醫診治、因病勢猛烈、延至四時半竟告不救、據西醫云、此項霍亂、爲傳染病之最烈者、其病菌之滋蔓、亦爲最速、一經患此、十九難治、現聞公立醫院正在注射霍亂疫苗、以防萬一、無錫探匪激戰擒獲盜魁　　公安局偵緝隊第一排探長　戴壽荃、探員王秉生、於前（三十一）日下午三時許、突據眼綫密報、有著名盜首史鴻培、率領羽黨、圖刦第五區堰

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　伊這次用的一頂蚊帳是一幅淺藍式的絲織品，上面還用很美麗的絲線、繡着許多林擒花，原來這時候正當暮春時節、林擒花恰好是處在最出風頭的地位上　，便不得不惜重它了！在大床的左邊，安着一張僅有的擱脚凳，也是紅木製的，它的高度大約是三英寸，面上用鮮艷的黄緞鋪着、這張脚踏凳在我們現代人的目光中看來，實在是毫不需要的，但在從前時候，無論你的床是怎樣的低，這一張脚踏凳還是少不掉的，其作用則祗是使人坐在床上時，兩條腿格外可以省力些而已。　　在這一間小小的寢宫的兩邊，車壁上也有四扇很寛大的窗開着，春日的明媚的陽光，從這四扇窗裏透射過來，照遍了全室，使屋子裏的溫度，常保持着六七十度上下，绝不像是在火車上經行野外的光景。太的對於這一點，當然是很滿意的；尤其是在每兩扇窗的中間的車壁上，還有幾幅色調很濃艷，花樣很生動的壁畫裝點着，經陽光一照射，便格外的光彩鮮明，足資欣賞了！這些壁畫都是用漆繪的，新舊的筆調，互相配合着，看去是非常調和的。它們的作者當然不是尋常鐵路工廠裏的漆工，而是特地從京中選拔出來的半藝術家，不然是那裏會有這樣好的手段？在這些壁畫的下面，各釘着很狹的一條木板，板的上面，擱着太后所需用的種種化裝品，以及許多零零星星的東西；伊要取用時是十分便利的。窗上，照例各有一幅黄緞製的簾幔掛着。（九六）詩人與河豚  梅雪　　茶寮中的座位，雖然没有規定，但是靠着天然几的一張老人檯，大概是白鬚飄飄者的座位，似我輩下　底下光澾澾的後生小子，誰也不敢分這片席。以下的一椿故事，便是老人座上的談片：　　「拚死吃河豚」這一句話，也是來歷，這是蘇東坡説的：「吃河豚值得一死」。記得數十年前，蘇紳潘姓家中，春日小飲，正在領略河豚滋味，忽有一汪姓詩人，前來闖席道：「有酒有肴，奈何不邀我？「主人道：「吃河豚，含有危險性，例不邀客，君若自願加入，亦所歡迎，但不知有這膽量否？」汪詩人笑道：「蘇東坡名滿天下，尙且爲着河豚值得一死，在下詩名，遠不如東坡，一條微命，又何足戀，撙前拚一死，詩膽大於天！」説罷，便卽入座。　　河豚的美處，全在腹部的白腴，俗稱「西施乳」，詩人嘗了「西施乳」，拚卻「東坡身」，嘖嘖歎美不集，飲至黄昏，才罷。主人下榻留客，並出青橄欖一盆，以供談助。且云：「青果可解河豚毒，食青果三四枚，足保安全」。於是主賓夜談，且談且啖青果。　　詩人吃河豚，是出於一時的興奮，吃過以後，不免心中惴惴，聽説青果能解毒，一枚又一枚，當作炒蠶豆吃，待到夜分已深，主人談倦，正擬請客歸臥，詩人忽捧腹喚痛道：「中了河豚毒，奈何奈何？」説時，涕泗交下，大有生命便在俄頃的模樣。主人大驚，令健僕扶詩人歸房，忙翻醫書，内載夜壺中積垢，可作急救河豚毒的特效藥，因覓得陳年夜壺一個，供在詩人面前，詩人急於要命，正想在夜壺中乞取靈藥，忽欲排洩，遂至便桶大瀉特瀉，瀉畢，痛也止子，無須服這特效藥了。　　主人奇甚，令僕人檢視排洩物。僕人道：「滿馬桶汆着的，都是没有消化的青橄欖」、原來在詩人肚裏作崇的東西，不是河豚，郤是解毒的青橄欖。　　詩膽大於天麽？這是詩人的誇大狂，人家只吃青果三四枚，他吃了三四十枚，以致大鬧期笑話，總算没有吃尿垢，還是詩人的造化。勝地臥遊記  黄康屯　　炎日村居，蟬聲聒耳。白雲往還，似傲我之不曾利用暑假作汗漫遊者，忽接遊踪之友人來函：「普陀面積甚小，前山後山，兩日踏遍。叢殺類杭州，惟沙灘爽朗，海水在脚邊奔騰；此爲杭州所未有。又遠望海面，若具五彩·羣島起伏，各具媚態。佛頂寺有康南海題句云：「微塵世界吾何愛，愛此海由雲島環」。此句實獲吾心。至最著名之梵音洞，潮音洞乃山隙所成，同遊者戲呼之爲大生殖器，不及杭州之洞遠甚。滇友某謂類此之洞，雲南到處都是，而此間稱爲名勝，亦有幸有不幸歟！……」　　吾於國内之消夏勝地，若牯嶺，若莫干，若青島，都未結緣，惟旅居南島，渡漫漫長夏者六年，無暑可避，無夏可消，而無日不與山水爲緣。饒有秋意之山巓，若檳榔嶼之升旗山，霹靂之太平山，蘇島之馬達山，嘗一舟登臨，黄菊滿蹊，蟲鳥驚寒，蒼茫雲海，暑氣全消。至頻往納凉之水濱，則若仰光之大湖，檳嶼之關仔閣，蘇東之淡水湖，或星月麗天，中流放棹；或磯邊結伴，枕石聽濤；或解衣磅　，與衆浮沈，均有令人樂不思蜀者。勝遊如昨，遷客萬里。今復值暑天，惟於寤寐中神遊之矣。金錢萬能金錢萬惡東北四連長  張恨水著　　第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回　　江氏道：老太爺，你提起打聽消息，我倒想起一件事。昨天我到對過全師長家去，那全師長可對我説了，讓我多買兩分報瞧瞧，又説假如我們家有什麽急事去找他的話，他願幫我的忙。我想着别是他已經早知道了這件事吧？趙翁道：你怎麽到他家裏去了？江氏道：是他打發老媽子來請了我去的。趙翁手摸了鬍子，點着頭道：那就是了。必是他早已知道了這件事情，先來相咱們一個招呼。雖然説向來没有來往，究竟人家是一番好意倒不可以辜負了人家。要不然，我就到他家裏去撞撞看吧？桂枝皺了眉道：據我看，還是别去打聽罷。因爲人家是個師長，這威風大了，咱們憑什麽去和他談交情。趙翁道：那不要緊求官不到秀才在，他見我我就向他打聽打聽，他不見我，我也不損失什麽。我看他一定是早知道了情形，憐惜咱們這一家子，不是老了，就是婦女，這也無非惜老憐貧的那一番意思，咱们到了這個時候，求人的日子就多着啦！這老頭兒説這話的時候，可帶着哭音，他那分心裏難受，就不用提了。江氏心想，他是個做師長的，消息總是清楚的，他昨天旣露了那點語因總可以打聽一些緣故出來。便道：老太爺去一去也好，打聽不出來，快點回來就是了。趙翁自舀了一盆水，將臉洗了，又擋了擋身上的灰，然後戴上一頂瓜皮小帽，恭恭敬敬的定向對門全師長家去。這裏娘兒倆對坐着，你看看我，我看看你，又陸續的垂下眼涙來。在這悲哀的情緒中，大家的神智都慌了，那裏還説得出什麽話來。（四四七）勞動的圖畫水冗  水冗　　天一幅浮彫的地圖樣的：白色的雲兒表示着洲，島，山，半島，……藍色的背景是海，洋，江，湖，河，……赤道上的的太陽，冒着火，燒着地球。没有風，空氣是固體的。　　田龜的背脊似的裂着。稻葉子乾癟的老頭兒那麽的，折着身子。附近的河已經可以瞧透它的高低的河床兒呢！水在地平綫下許多尺。岸旁的蘆葦沉默地，頽廢地垂着腦袋。　　水車好像神話裏的龍，斜斜地躺着，頭兒長長的伸進河裏，一個長頸子鹿喝着水樣的。轆轆地，嘆息似的水車的葉片兒捲着水。　　四五個，赤着鐵的胳膞，胸脯周圍繫着粗繩子，彎着腰兒，背縴那麽的；拖着沉重的步子，繞着大車盤打旋兒。人回到下等動物去了呵！　　水跑到患着渴症的溝兒，立刻乾啦！　　牛兒樣的喘着，汗兒雨似的沿下來。把希望放在大車盤上。　　（氣候是壞的，世界却也永遠地不轉變！）　　望望天，不會下雨，憂愁重重地壓着三個的心見。拉雜話我對於求雨的感想（上）  天虚我生　　我家的女傭説：「今天落了雨，要做十八個陣頭，天天在這時候，凖是有雨，」他講這話是民國二十三年的七月十七日，就是陰歷六月六日，他是依着農家的古話來説的。並不是外國的預言家，也不是張天師的門徒，然而他的話，居然應了，一連六天，果然天天上午有雨，而且一天多似一天，這是什麽原故呢？有人説是大家求得來的，只不過是小雨，直到張天師設壇，纔得大雨，究竟道家的法力大！而一般信佛的，却歸功於菩薩，一般信敎的，則歸功於天主，各有各的信仰，大家都很欣欣自慰，覺得自已所信仰的宗敎，實在是不錯的；惟有科學家説是偶然凑巧，力闢迷信，因爲外國的人工雨，還未達到得失相償的成績，我們中國人只該等候，不該盲從瞎附，開着倒車，趨向迷信一途，什麽祈禱呢，斷屠呢，連官府也駡在裏面。然而按到實在，也不過是空言罷呢？就我之見，趁此機會，大可以因勢利導一下，做兩塊匾額，掛到求雨的法壇上去，寫上一種標語式的四個大字，一爲「天從人願」一爲「人力回天」倒是很在實際的，因爲一般心理，凡是人力所不能到的任何事情，莫諉之於天，其實，天是空的，本來無物，有什麽主宰，主宰的仍然是人；凡人所見的日月星辰，風雲雷雨，完全是人心裏有了感覺，眼睛裏才會看到，五官四體，莫不由於一心爲之主宰，若使心不在焉，他就視而不見，聽而不聞，如果他專心一致的，不爲環境所摇惑，他的心有所專，他的事必有成，例如天文家的測騐，科學家的發明，只要專心一致的專攻着一門，一定中以達到他的目的，不説别的，單就無綫電來説，發明製造的人，他的心專屬於此，所以會得成功，我們買了一座收音機來開着聽，如果心不在焉，他就會得聽而不聞；而且不用心去對凖某一週波，他所收着的音，决不是你所需要的，這是當然的事，足見天空中播着幾十種的音，他是任從人願去收他的，你的家庭中人，各人的心願不同，有的愛聽哭聲，有的愛聽彈唱，有的愛聽演説，大家的心志不能一致，各有各的權力，上下其乎，你就没法子來主宰他；而天空中的音浪，也就没法子來依從你的心願，播送到你耳朶裏來，從來的水火刀兵，大都亦由人心所召；河防本有專職，但是前清的官吏，一心只在自已弄錢，越是决口搶險，越是發財，他們這班對於河工有權力的，一心只在幸災樂禍，可以上下其乎，而一般民衆的心志，也不一致的「盡力乎溝劣洫」於是乎釀成了空前的水災，豈不是人召的嗎！救火會也是各處都有，然而機械的作用，只能救着燃眉之急，「防患未然」仍要地方上的所有居民。　　來函　編輯先生：今日在貴刊見到「世界珍聞」的張若谷作的歐羅巴巡禮中的兩張照相，覺得我對於這錯誤應當來改正。作者指爲「柏林之議院一，其實這建築不是德國－作者指爲柏林的議院，却是一座敎堂，稱爲“Dom”。德國議院的建築，完全不是這羅馬式的。而且已於去年三月間燬於火了。所謂「柏林之莫愁别宫」並不是在柏林，却在Potadsn離柏林約三十餘公里，不能説是附屬於柏林的。在種種關係上，却是獨立的。作者對於「無愁磨坊」説是寓言，其實是事實，且與作者所述有些不同。　　希望編輯先生能將這數點，予以更正。　　梅川上</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊貢献話國貨前途之好希望  仰葊　　國際貿易局，最近發表，本市對外貿易，本年一月至六月，入超竟達二萬萬餘元，這種驚人的消息，凡是留心國家社會經濟狀况的，人人汗流夾背，爲之駭懼不置。可是在這輸出萎縮，輸入减少，獨日貨源源而來，國民經濟入於最重凋殘之下，似覺差强人意，爲國貨前途留一綫之希望的，有下列三件事：　　第一是各地國貨公司的發展　自從上海中國兩國貨公司成立以後，日呈蓬勃的氣象，尤爲國民一致所歡迎，營業的發達，打破以前的紀録。於是各地中國國貨公司接踵以起，兩三年内不難達到預定全國共設五十處國貨公司之願望，這種國貨網之計畫，推行國貨的效力最大，這是第一好希望。　　第二浙江省設立商務管理局　吾們主張全國各地統制工商業，纔能使國貨有實際推行的效力，否則枝枝節節，總非辦法。現在浙江省政府居然爲發展國貨事業實行統制政策起見，特組商務管理局。觀其所辦事業中有（一）計畫及提倡辦理生産事業，（二）保護並奬勵國貨之製造與推銷，（三）取締劣貨及不適宜貨品之製造與販賣，（四）指導海外貿易等等，而於工商業之管理與改進，尤特别注意，果能行之有效，吾知一二年後，浙江省之國貨事業，大有可觀，而外貨之於浙省，可以絶跡了。這是第二好希望。　　第三是最近國外市塲的開拓　上海國際貿易局，對於國外貿易，年來特别注意，曾經介紹英美商人直接採辦國産品，運銷外洋，並隨時以外國需要貨品，通知國貨廠商準備交易，同時實業部復在南洋設法中國國貨之銷路，以挽回每年輸出巨額的金錢。一般廠商，亦能放大目光，不作同業中無謂的混戰，一致以推廣國外市塲爲目標，影響所及，卽英商亦能輸之國貨一百五十餘種作推銷海外的舉動，這是第三好希望。　　在這籠罩不景氣之婦女國貨年中，能有三個好希望，來安慰國人，吾們都要一致的努力幹去，不要辜負這好希望。國貨談話提倡國貨與大學生  劉導溱　　今日我國大學生之學校生活，較之社會上一般人之日常生活過分懸殊，衣必西裝革履，食必西餐豐饌，住必洋房大厦，甚至一切日常用品，非「Madein　America」「France　Made」莫屬，無怪乎去年敎育部派員視察上海六大學之報各謂：「…該校崇尙浮華·奢爹已極！……」雖這寥寥數語，蓋亦公允之言論也。　　的確，目下大學生的一般病象，都充滿着虚驕浮囂，祗會消費，不能生産，他們並一味地順應潮流，適合環境，蹈常襲古的吾行吾素，祗認爲英國貨最精良，法國貨最優美，美國貨最時新，……而對於國貨獨不屑一顧，莫不説外國貨若何之長，中國貨若何之短，想敎他們來提倡國貨，服用國貨，還不是言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，風馬牛不相及哩！　　須知道，大學生是智識份子，先知先覺者，負有領導民衆建設新中國的使命；在一個産業落後的我國，實業救國，當然視爲急要之圖，但是實業建設，談何容易？必須有資本，必須有人才，必須具有遠大的眼光與充分的智識；以過去數十年而言，我國産業，因受世界不景氣之襲擊，外貨之排擠而失敗者固甚多，但因經營不善，籌劃不良，以致破産者，亦屬不少，經營不善，籌劃不良，乃缺乏人才之一大證明，由是可知人才實較資本爲重大，而培植人才，乃成爲建設事業的先决問題。　　學校是製造人才的大本營，是社會事業的研究所，大學生們，自應憑着學校的主旨，隨着社會現實環境的需要，以冀養成一種思想，切實鍜鍊，以作將來貢獻社會的準備：蓋思想是從觀察得來的一種學問，書本的記載，理論的闡説，祗不過是用來指示探求智識的途徑；如果單憑書本和理論，而不加以現實環境的觀察，那是斷不會樹立建設事業的基礎；因爲要籌劃一種事業，必須先有籌劃某種事業的動機，要有這種動機，就不得不向社會裏多求觀察。　　提倡國貨，服用國貨的運動，是中國近來不可緩的事實，如果大學生們能以身作則的提倡服用，也是響應這種運動成功的一個舉動，更是喚同民衆去研究國貨的一個動機：能辨别國貨之有無，品質之良窊，纔會感覺到創造的需要；大學生們！我願以提倡國貨服用國貨的聲浪，永遠地灌入你們的耳鼓，印人你們的腦海，以打動你們去改良國貨的心坎，撥動你們去創造國貨的動機，庶幾你們的出路，有所利賴！失業的恐怖，可以免除。鞏固我們的防綫  茸餘　　經濟的侵略，難道比武力的侵略好一些嗎？我看實在還利害一些。因爲武力侵略，便是勝利一方面，也有若干的犧牲；而且也得不到人家的好感。惟有經濟侵略，眞像「蜜餞砒霜」一般吮吸了人家的骨髓，騙取了人家的銅錢，人家一些都不怨他恨他。所以經濟侵略我敢肯定的説：是外人吞滅我們最惡辣最兇狠的手段。　　「商戰好似兵戰」，這一句話一些也不錯！兩軍肉搏的當兒，非是你死，即是我亡，决不有兩俱保全之理。商品的競爭，也是這樣，你得勝，你賺錢，我便失敗而消滅。　　諸位看了上面的兩層意思，便知道提倡國貨，正是我們和敵人决戰的當兒；也是我們生死存亡的一個重要關頭。我們雖然不能攻打出去，至少要守住我們的防綫，給敵人不致侵入。所以多用一分國貨，卽是减少一分外貨的侵入；也卽爲國貨的壁壘多加一重保障。奉勸諸位同胞，穿起了甲胄，肩起了長鎗，努力的前進，爲國貨界盡一些防守的責任。　　説也可憐！我們中國的兵力，祗站在防守的地位，而且尙虞不足，因爲武器訓練，樣樣不如别人。不過閘北和喜峰口二役，也給敵人以不少的敎訓，足替我們的民衆，爭得些許體面。至於我們商戰的力量，雖説和兵力一樣，祗够防守。不過這防守是比較的容易多了，因爲我不願意用外貨，人家不會來强姦你的，一天一天的下去，怕他們不棄甲曳兵而走嗎？所以千句併一句説：外貨的得以暢銷，還是我們自已的壁壘未固，防守力太薄弱的緣故。「物必自腐面後蟲生」，倘使我們中國人心未全死的話，也應該起來堅固防綫，抵禦外作侮：買方和賣方，站在一條綫上，和那敵人奮鬥。　　説也慚愧！我們的國貨，又有一「眞國貨」「似國貨」「假國貨」的區别，這實在使我們慚愧到萬分，眞有啞子吃黄連的一般苦楚。「眞國貨」當然是商戰上的一個眞的勇士，呌人無可指摘。「似國貨」呢，原料是外來的，不過我們再製煉一下。這種銀灰色的國貨，眞呌人「用之傷心，不用又不可。」還有一種「假國貨」，那當然是把外貨改頭換面的來一下子，鬼域伎倆，也呌人防不勝防。咳！我們的防綫中出了騎墻的蝙蝠，出了通敵的奸細，這一仗準敗無疑。　　前車之覆「後車之鑒」。過去的失敗，不必説了。從今時今刻起，我們須要鞏固我們的防綫，再和敵人奮鬥一下。那戰術有二：第一是肅清内亂，便是把「似國貨」的加以改正；「假國貨」的加以懲戒。第二是大衆擁護，社會上的他們和她們，一致起來，擁護我們眞正的國産。國貨寫眞國貨在西安  趙秉仁　　—西北流動展覽最精采之一幕—　　負責重大使命的國貨西北流動展覽團由滬出發，歷經開封鄭州洛陽各地，到處舉行盛大展覽，到處受當地民衆熱烈歡迎。現在，該團在全團團員極度振奮之下，已到達陜西省會－西安，而陜人數月熱望的國貨展覽會也就於七月二十日宣告開幕了。　　國貨展覽在西安是空前創舉，所以特别能予人以刺戟，當展覽消息傳至西安時，一般人就引頸盼望着，及至團體到達正式宣告開幕，西安人士，上至政府長官下至一般民衆－可眞感到了如願以償底無上快慰，奔走相告，互約參觀，人人都具着滿腔熱忱，一時西安全市，國貨空氣之濃厚眞是莫可比擬了。　　展覽會塲在馬房門民衆敎育館，地位寛敞，並略擅園林之勝，參加廠商分三塲陳列，在第一塲陳列者爲正泰，仁昌永，永安堂，光華，五和，華昌，中國化工，等七家，第二塲爲美亞與三友，第三塲爲家庭，天廚，中華琺瑯，鴻瓣，華成，達隆，華福，新亞，中國國貨公司等十家，各塲布置均頗具巧思，尤以美亞綢廠中華琺瑯各種綢緞之布置爲引人注目。開幕日省府主席親臨揭幕，各機關長官亦均有慷慨激昻的演説，而參觀羣衆往來如潮湧，其擁擠之狀，更難形容，各廠職員見此情形，非常感奮，因此服務與答問，更見週到，蒞會參觀人士無不滿意以去。　　西安是西北的起點，也是這次國貨西北流動展覽團的最大目的地。以這樣偏遠的地方，國貨的踪跡自然未曾有過大宗到達的，因此，當地人士對於國貨也就少認識少購用了。但同時洋貨－特别是日貨却早已大宗到了這個偏遠的地方，侵佔着幾乎是整個的市面，森下博藥房大做旗幟爲仁丹做最能引人注意的遊行廣告，此在東南已不致發現的事，在此地却仍是司空見慣，天天可以遇到的。這次西北流動展覽團西來舉行盛大的國貨展覽，一面予民衆以認識，俾使打破迷信洋貨的變態心理，一面開國貨西來之先路，藉以奪回幾已全部失去的西北市塲。現在展覽開幕，政府旣表示廣大底同情，民衆復顯示熱烈的注意，這可見西安非不要國貨，以前國貨踪踪罕至，直國貨甘心放棄西安。今而後，以展覽會之效果，國貨已見抬頭之機，至如何握住機會，以至如何經營，此則有待於吾國貨工廠之自行努力研求，記者竊願滬上有志西來經營之各工廠從速有一組織，聯合進行，這樣纔比較是有力和有望了。國貨史料馬玉山有弟矣  雅潔　　目今都市鄉鎭，大公司洋雜店，已莫不知有馬寳山餅乾，且廣行推銷之，殊不知該公司之能享今日盛譽，其間固有一番刻苦奮鬥歷史在内，爰記之如下，以供關心國貨事業讀者之參考焉。　　距今三十四年前，一旅美習作餅乾糖果事業之青年，返歸故國，罄其所有辛苦挣得資財，而闢廠從事於所業，而與外貨競爭，廠設廣東，因當時都市人士，視餅果不啻消毫奢爹品，故願購外貨以相誇耀，更不知有國貨矣，然經此富有毅力之馬君玉山，奮其不屈不撓之精神，始終努力，得有設立七廠，二十一支店，而使餅果成爲普及化之成績。　　其後，迭次内亂頻繁，政治不清之影響，遂使此正在培植中之事業，一蹶不振，而馬君亦不幸於民十七年身故，幾陷該廠於不救，所幸君弟寳山，深明大義，見識廣遠，乃偕子弟，繼續完志，竭力整頓，改革制度，更設總廠於香港，改進出品，精益求精，於是過去五年中，得暢行華南，同時全國都市鄉鎭，亦皆採用，因鑒於事業已有起色，特於民廿二年，斥資八萬元，在本埠設廠以供給市塲需要，降至去年，該公司出品，已爲中外人士所樂用，然尙不能大量供給本埠，因大部果餅，均得運銷南非，南美，及南海各島也，至於國内市塲之推廣，已無遠弗届，長江一帶，華北華南，乃其著者云。</p>

<p>上海市商會國貨商塲特刊復興民旅與提倡國貨  俞佐庭　　據最近國際貿易局發表統計，本年上半期六個月中，入超達三萬萬元以上，是則本年總額，將倍其數。考歷年往例，下半期六個月，較上半期爲尤多。則今年入超額，當在六萬萬之上。吾國人去年曾以「國貨年」自勉，今年復以「婦女國貨年」爲婦女界提倡，提倡之呼聲與努力不可謂不大，而其成效如是。此實爲我國民經濟當前最嚴重之問題。　　吾國今日艱難偉大之民族復興工作，有主張先以軍事統一國家者，有主張從文化入手，敎育民衆者；亦有主張以澄清吏治改革政治爲前提者，綜觀以上各端，都爲我國當前尊定國基之切要工作，主張各異，而於復興民族之任務則一。雖然，我國處於今日列强政治經濟角逐之下，新興工業長困於衰敝之境，經濟危機，日趨嚴重，其爲害我民族前途之發展尤大，故吾人以爲民族復興與經濟盛衰，休戚相關，必先振興國民經濟與繁榮新與工業，而後始能奠定國家，復興民族。　　提倡國貨爲振興國民經濟之切要方法。其責任當由全國朝野上下共負之，如政府則須作關税上之保護，須廢除苛雜以紓解國貨工商界之苦痛；如金融界則須以實力輔助我新興工業之成長。凡此固盡人皆知，毋庸贅述。兹試言工商業者與一般民衆對於提倡國貨之責任。　　今日國貨常受外貨排斥，而從事於國貨産銷之工商業者徒知嘆息而不作補救之圖，此爲過去之失　，吾人以爲今後從事工商業者應努力之道有三，一曰産銷合作，實行有計劃之生産與推銷。吾人須知生産與推銷决不能各自分離。有社會之需要，而後始能决定生産商品之數量，苟盲目生産，不借無益，抑且引起國貨工商界自身無謂競爭，而予外貨以可乘之隙。二曰生産人民日用必需品，蓋日用必需品，其供給量至大，苟自國不能生産，由舶來品替，則利權外溢，殊爲浩大；故除少數奢侈品以及特殊産物暫時取給舶來品外，一切日用品概以達到自給自足爲今後努力之目標。三日採用科學管理與新技術，處今日世界商戰劇烈之時代，從事工商業者苟墨守舊法，不採取新技術，不運用科學管理方法，結果必遭失敗，故工商業者應養成運用新智識，以應付商戰之競爭。　　然則國人對提倡國貨應負之責任何如？曰，國人有購買國貨，服用國貨之義務。曠觀世界，任獨立國家之人民，無不以服用本國貨物爲無上光榮，而吾國則反是，今日除農民及一般平民不得已取用廉價舶來品外，而都市仕女，常以服用洋貨爲時髦，據國際貿易局調查香粉一項進口，竟月達數萬元，雖然人民有服用國貨之自由，政府無法干涉，法律亦無明文，而人民實負有道義上之責任。今日除少數傷心病狂而不顯國家經濟命脈陷於萬刦不復是之徒，服用國貨，决非困難之事。故養成一般人民愛用國貨之心理，實爲要圖。　　吾人敢正告國人曰：提倡國貨，始得繁榮今日之新興工業，始得挽救當前之經濟危機，一旦新興工業與國民經濟步入繁榮之途，然後可以言復興民族。我對於國貨界之貢獻  陳蔗青　　提倡國貨四字。喧騰於社會者二十餘年矣。猶憶民國元二年間。伍秩庸王文典諸先生。組織國貨維持會於滬。余時服務農曹。主管商政。因公南來。迭聞儻論。不禁心焉儀之。迨民國四年。農商部總長周公自齊。提議於舊都商品。陳列所。開設第一次國貨展覽會。余以工商司長。兼充該會副會長。籌備半載。開會月餘。用欵僅八千餘元。各省特産。風湧雲集。大自商務印書館之各種機器。小正福建之各種漆品。以及杭綢湘繡。贛磁浙扇。巨細畢陳。洋洋大觀。時值工商業勃興。民心喁喁望治。此爲一時期。迨後五四風潮。民衆羣起抗日。國貨亦遂應時而興。如今之家庭工業社無敵牌牙粉，卽當時産物之一。後此十餘年來。每度抵制外貨一次，卽國貨盛行一次。國民政府成立以來。工商部始設國貨展覽會於滬。大事提倡。上海市商會繼之。亦於天后宫會址附設國貨商塲。約集同業。設肆販賣。淞滬役後。羣感外貨之日肆傾銷。國貨之日加困蹙。志士聞人。奔走呼號。又有中國國貨公司之設。貿易之盛。冠於他埠。於以知民心尙未盡死。國貨猶有一綫生機。亦卽本會此次擴大宣傳。繼續努力。發揚光大。不敢自餒之所由來也。惟是國貨之於社會。固與各個人息息相關。人民無不愛國。卽無不愛自國之貨。况以我國人民生計之蹙。國家入超之巨。苟不急起直追。宇宙雖大。將無立足之地。此種心理。盡人皆然。欲爲增加推廣之效率計。朝野上下。所應注意者。約舉數點於下。　　（一）政府於訂定國貨税率及運費時。除採用財政政策外。應兼採經濟政策。　　（二）工商界應極力研究改良製造方法。迎合消費者心理。　　（三）社會應競以國貨相當。以用外貨爲恥。尤望政府以身作則。勿以此專責之人民。　　（四）政府對工商界能製造或摹仿特著成績者。予以相當之奬勵。　　（五）金融界對於國貨公司或廠家之貸欵。予以特殊之便利方法。　　總之欲期望國貨之能眞正發達。非整個社會全體動員不爲功。本會特盡民衆團體一部份之義務而已。余昔在德時。曾聞伯倫赫脱敎授Prof.Bernhardt言。從前德國之兵輪商艦。皆請英國代造。後英國見其定貨之多。懼其爭壩海上。拒不接受。德乃著手自行製造。不數年而艦成。特駛至英之Southampton港陳覽。供人參觀。並於晚間以電燈綴Made　in　Germany（德國製造）數字於艦旁。以示國人之能自造。不必假手外人。兹特述此一叚故事。亦希望我國人能有膺此光榮之一日也。服用國貨芻言  柯幹臣　　海禁旣開，中西互市，貿易入超，年盛一年，而自歐戰以還，各國承戰亂之餘，百孔千瘡，財力大遜，鈎心鬥角，益思傾銷其過剩之商品　，以償其戰時之損失，故羣以我國爲尾閭，冀遂其向外侵略榨取之野心，乃國人不知儆惕，生於憂患，習於奢靡，舉凡衣，食，住，行，以及種種日用所需之品，均非外貨不足以饜其慾望，非外貨不足以炫其豪華，遂致抵制外貨，徒托空言，提倡國貨，終鮮實效，商人視販賣外貨爲利藪，人民以服用外貨爲尊榮，權利外溢，曠古未有，生産日减，失業年增，工商凋零，農村崩潰，人民膏血，日趨枯竭，國家命脈，日見動摇，事之痛心，寧有逾於此哉？夫國於天地，必有與立，中國民族，以其文化之優秀，歷史之悠久，土地之廣博，物産之豐富，宜乎早具自給自足之能力，而無待仰給於外人，徒以民智閉塞，人心麻木，昧於團結圖存之大義，缺乏獨立自强之精神，泄沓終日，惟個人之榮利安樂是求，語云，燎原之災，起於星星之火，滔天之浪，始於涓涓之流，則吾民族將來覆亡之禍，安知不基於今日國民愛用外貨之心理乎？蓋經濟侵略，有如慢性癆瘵，軍事侵略，有如急性霍亂，後者咸知驚戒，咸知預防，而前者類都漠然，類都忽視，玩延日久，每致一蹶不振，無可救藥，中國民族，正坐此病，迄於今日，更形顯著，倘不急救，覆亡立至。故今日國民，均應有深刻之覺悟，明確之認識，國難重心，在於經濟，經濟不能獨立，較之政治不能獨立，領土不能完整，更爲危險而可懼，今後國人所應奮起以求者，爲經濟之獨立，生活之自給，凡屬日常必需之品，價無論貴賤，質無論優劣，悉以儘量服用國貨爲前提，國難日亟，責無旁貸，吾人旣不能臥薪嘗膽，枕戈前驅，亦應稍抑奢望，勉嗜艱苦，粗衣惡食，養成服用國貨之美德，造成服用國貨之風尙，羣以愛用外貨爲可恥，使愛用外貨者，亦因社會之制裁，而自覺其非，救亡禦侮，唯此是賴，富國裕民，卽斯爲本。吾人不必效命疆塲，捨身殺敵，祗須服用國貨，便可無敵不摧，無戰不克，中國人民，果有愛國之决心，中國民族，果有復興之毅力，請勿河漢斯言，上海市商會，夙以提倡國貨爲職志，且能不尙空談，見諸實行，於民國二十年夏，就會内附設國貨陳列所之原址，添闢國貨商塲，以廣國貨之銷路，而便市民之採購，創設以來，成效卓著，比以與各廠商所訂之契約，業届期滿，遂復重加擴充，力求美備，並定八月一日，爲開幕之期，行見風聲所播，全國景從，前途光大，未可限量，爰貢數言，以作芻蕘。提倡國貨挽回入超  馬少荃　　我國的國貨運動已經有了極悠久的歷史，經過工商界不斷的努力，和國民熱誠的倡導，近年來已有蓬蓬勃勃，一日千里之勢。我們對於這進步的現象，固然覺得前途是極有希望的。但是我們假使詳細地檢閲過去提倡國貨的成績，和外貨積極傾銷的情形，就可以知道我們的國貨運動，非但不能算是成功，依然處於失敗的地位呢！最近海關方面的貿易統計，自本年一月至六月，以上海一埠而論，對外貿易，入超竟達二萬另三百另六萬七千餘元。我們看了這個鉅大的入超數字，就可以知道我們提倡的國貨運動，究竟有了多少成効呢？所以我説我們的國貨運動，非但不能算是成功，簡直是依然處於失敗的地位。我希望全國國民和工商界，應急起直追，努力改良國貨的品質，設法推銷内地和國外，要把年年流往國外的金錢，設法挽回才好呢！現在我把對於目前應該注意的幾點寫在下面，以供工商界之參考。　　一、改良品質　我們知道現在一般人對於服用國貨，都已經有了相當的認識。差不多没有一個人，（除了慣用洋貨者外）願意故意去買洋貨而不買國貨的了。但是往往，因爲國貨的品質有的比較洋貨相差太遠，於是就去買品質優良的洋貨了。我們以後應該注意到這一點，將國貨的品質極力提高。尤其對於有許多商人竟把洋貨改頭換面冒充國貨的事，應該特别注意，設法取締，以免危害國貨的銷塲。　　二、推銷内地　最近工商界頗能注意到内地的推銷，像到西北去流動展覽等等。但是我們仔細考察内地的情形，洋貨的銷塲，依然非常廣大，上海市塲所盛行的各種國貨，在内地依然是極少銷行，所以我們必須聯合各廠商和内地的同志，努力推銷各種國貨，把原有的洋貨市塲奪爲我有，這樣才可以漸漸减少入超的數字了。　　三、推銷國外　我國在國外以南洋一帶爲最大的市塲，但據最近的情形看來，國貨在南洋的銷路，也是非常萎縮。我們爲挽救未來的國貨的危機起見，我們應該有一種計劃，擴大對外貿易。同時我們應該喚起政府的注意，應該由國營的招商局籌辦直接航行外洋的輪船，减輕國貨的運費。同時希望將最近公布的新税則，也有一些適當的修改，以免國貨在海外滯銷。　　四、注重宣傳　近年來對於國貨運動的宣傳，不可説不努力，但是仍舊缺乏有系統的普遍的宣傳。我們應該對於消費者有一種詳細的指導。使消費者明白服用國貨的利益。一方面必須自已設法改良國貨的品質，使消費者有一種信仰，所謂眞金不怕火燒，也就是這個道理了。　　總之，我們提倡國貨應該達到使「入超」變爲「出超」的地步，方可算是成功。現在離開這個目樣，相差甚遠，希望大家一致努力，使這個老大的産業落後的國家，變爲一個新興的工業的國家。對蔣委員長令嚴懲外貨冒充國貨之感想  金潤庠　　軍事委員會蔣委員長。鑒於晚近外貨傾銷。日見激增。以致國貨壅滯。工商破産。且復有多數奸商。每以李代桃僵之手腕。將外貨標記截去。冒用商標。在國貨中混售。冀圖厚利。是於發展國貨前途。實有莫大危險。故特下嚴懲外貨冒充國貨之明令。促彼奸商自悟。竊以我國提倡國貨之聲。遐邇咸見。宜乎國貨暢銷。外貨絶跡矣。但按之事實。乃大相背馳。至於提倡國貨之工作。幾等於零。而反以提倡國貨完全國貨空氣。爲投機者所利用。嗟乎。我國國貨。殆將終無發展之日也哉。　　嘗考六十年來。全國貿易之概况。於前清同治之始年。當時進口貨值。爲五一二九三五七八兩。出口貨值。爲五四○○六五○九兩。至民國十九年。輸入貨值。爲一三二八二三一九八六兩。輸出貨值。爲九一三三一九八三四兩。雖於貿易總額上觀之。其數量年有增進。迄於今此。累增已不僅倍蓰。然而細一按之。當六十年之前。輸出之貿易。超過輸入。厥後總額。雖年有進步。而輸入則日形超過。此實深可殷憂之現象也。今者。吾國工商業。已較六十年前爲進步矣。所出貨品。其有能與舶來品相頑抗者。數見不鮮。昔乎我國民衆。咸喜愛用外國貨。對於本國貨。棄之如泥土。不屑顧問。是皆受外貨之浸淫深毒。有以致之。自我政府抵定南北。首</p>

<p>以提倡國貨爲當今之急務。民國十七年冬。由工商部發起。在上海新普育堂。舉行中華國貨展覽會。搜集全國出品。陳列一堂。以供觀摩。而振國光。當時中外人士。賭斯盛會。相率驚喜。僉以中華民國。固爲後起之工業國。昔以器械原料。尙未完備。全賴手工製作。以此爲恨耳。惟此後國民之愛用外貨心理。端爲一變。又經各省市縣相效舉行。努力宣傳。成效更著。國貨銷路。漸見起色。外貨逐漸淘汰。可知吾國貨前途。正賴民衆互相提携。産銷合作。其顯然明矣。　　夫物必自腐。而後蟲生之。國必自敗。而後人伐之。我國方慶國貨發達。指日可期。而專以遠東爲經濟策源地之外商。積極追踵。未間放鬆。始以物誘。繼以利導。彼等正以我國民衆採用國貨之踴躍。不惜實行冒牌影戤。魚目混珠之狠毒手段。以朦國人之眼目。勾結無恥奸商。相與運悻。於是國貨興而復衰。民生困苦塗炭。國家原氣。乃大沮喪。故蔣委員長下令。器懲冒充國貨。其所以昭炯戒。剷國内之敗類。拯國家於危亡也。　　總之。吾國國難之危急。實急於火勢燃眉之時。吾國工商業。已處於水盡山窮之際。此難關端視吾人之能羣策羣力。團結一致。産銷合作以爲斷。否則吾人惟汲汲於萁豆　牆之爭。忘國本而甘作奸賊。其亦知强鄰外侮之環伺於吾人之傍者。早已千方百計。以國吞噬。國人乎。請速猛醒。永誌勿忘。謹進數言。想不厭具　縷。上海市商會北市國貨商塲重新開幕之回顧  朱伯元　　本會北市國貨商塲，自成立以來，已届三載，現因與參加廠商所訂期限已滿，爲繼續努力起見，從事改組，特將内外部刷新，大加擴充，業於前日改組就具，重行開幕云，溯自本商塲創設伊始，規模狹小，時在民國二十年夏季，經三閲月之規畫，假商品陳列所一樓之地址，於六月間開幕，當時本會前主席王曉籟先生及常委王延松先生等，以陳列所性質，專事搜羅國貨，供人參考，尙不能充分利用時間與地位，供人採購，譬如來賓入所參觀者，經所員之指導，某爲國貨，某爲舶來品，國貨之優點何在，使用舶來品之利弊如何，國貨商標與舶來品商標，如何區别，與夫市上冒牌國貨，如何鑒别等，來賓得此觀點後，須重返市上求之，豈不多費周折，多感困難，則莫若利用陳列所地位，附設商塲，專售國貨，較爲便利，於是提交執行委員會議决通過，積極籌備，本商塲乃得應時勢之需要，而呱呱墮地矣，其内容與普通展覽會及臨時國貨商塲不同之點，厥有四端：　　（一）本商塲參加廠商，每業以一家爲限，同時不得有同性質同營業之貨櫃並列，以免衝突而期普遍。　　（二）在塲貨物，均經鑒别，確爲國貨，始得發售，以期名實相符。　　（三）商塲租價，力求貶抑，以期節省開支，减低貨價，務使國貨暢銷，人盡樂購。　　（四）訓練櫃員，務盡商業人員應盡之責，力求態度和靄，任事忠心，爲推廣國貨之助　　本此四項宗旨，經營服務，故商塲之成績，得以略具，目前本外埠各大國貨商塲，亦次第應運而興，國貨銷路，似亦逐漸推廣，此則不能不歸功於本商塲創辦諸公之微指也，至參加廠商，第一年因一樓地位有限，僅二十餘家，第二年擴充二樓，增加十餘家，共計參加者有三十餘家之多，綜核商塲營業數額，第一年爲二十萬元有奇，第二年爲十六萬餘元，第三年爲十四萬餘元，共計爲五十餘萬元，以此區區之數，厠諸現代商戰之中，固如太倉之一粟，而國貨之滯銷，壓迫於外貨傾銷之下，又如累卵而上天，我國貨廠家，不畏艱苦，不畏强禦，而猶挣扎於風雨飄摇泥塗濘滑之中者，何哉，豈不以國事蜩蟾民生凋弊，勉力支持，所以冀國人之醒悟，而免利權之外溢乎？是則本商塲三年以來，得此行潦之水，以與河海相競爭，亦不無小補，此又不能不深感賜顧者之熱忱愛國，各廠商之深明大義，與夫各櫃員各辦事員奮勉從公之效也。廼者本商塲改組完成，旣已開幕矣，國恥未除，危殆猶昔，外貨傾銷，視前尤甚，聞本年入超，已及三億元，較之上年，增加兩倍有餘，嗚呼，不謂提倡國貨之效，尙未顯著，而此怵目驚心之統計，已呈於吾人之前，吾廠商乎，吾同胞乎，此後將如何益自奮勉，以期最後之勝利乎，夫入超出超之升降，不屬諸吾，而購買之權，操諸吾手，進步之途，實啟吾前，非吾國民羣策羣力，以求國貨之出路，其誰矢之國貨討論提供一個切實的辦法  陶熊　　—組織婦女國貨消費合作社—　　國貨運動是到了實際行動的一個階段了。　　没有切實有效的辦法，行動是必然會陷於空虚，頽唐，而步步走向消沈的墳塞中去。因此個人在這裏將提供一個提倡國貨的最切實有效的辦法，供獻給從事國貨運動的同志們參考。　　目前我們的國貨運動是包含着兩大原則：（一）增加生産；（二）提倡服用國貨。增加生産的問題，我們將另文討論，此地我們僅僅想提出怎樣提倡服用國貨這個問題。其實擴大點講來，要是提倡服用國貨，有着相當的成功之後，國貨的需要自然是大量高漲，那未國貨生産，也必然會跟着需要的求過於供而大量增加了。　　現社會的消費經濟，可以説是絶大部份掌握在婦女界的手裏，特别在我國這個以婦女爲家庭中心的國家。因此我們從事國貨運動，提倡服用國貨，只有在婦女界方面進行，才能收效宏博，要是忽略了這一點，我們的國貨運動是不能有多大的效果又是無疑。所以在國貨年之後，我們又有了這個婦女國貨年。　　可是婦女們的心理是最講究虚榮的，我們也不容有所掩飾，現在我國的女同胞又那一個不喜歡服用舶來品呢？鐵的事實上，現在都市裏的女同胞們的衣，食，住，行，樂，又無不一講求洋化，無一不崇尙洋貨，更無一不以服用洋貨相炫耀，因此在以婦女爲家庭中心的家庭，社會，也就跟着女同胞們的洋貨心理而到處洋化了。無疑的這是我國社會經濟前途的一個嚴重危機！同時也是國家民族生存的危機。－是怎樣嚴重的一個危機喲！　　女同胞們愛用洋貨，崇尙虚榮的心理，也就是我國國貨運動中，當前第一絶大障礙。　　然而女同胞們又何嘗自已甘心服用洋貨，擔當賣國，擔當出賣民族利益的罪名呢？女同胞們又何嘗甘心願意承受「洋貨推銷員」的奚落呢？女同胞只不過是在一時社會的風尙中盲從着而已！　　因此在這裏，我們又明確地認識了女同胞們崇尙虚榮，崇尙服用洋貨的心理，只是社會的一時風尙。而要改革女同胞們的心理，只有，先改革社會的風尙，要改革社會的風尙，我們只有用羣衆的力量，團體的力量，大部分人的力量，才能蕆事。　　要達到這個目的，我們唯有採用合作的辦法，組織起「婦女國貨消費合作社」來。　　「婦女國貨消費合作社，」乃是從事國貨運動的女同胞們，在提倡服用國貨的目的之下，採取團體的手段，以合作的力量，來改善現社會不良的風尙，共同從事服用國貨，同時復謀减少消費上的浪費的一種團體組織。　　個人的力量是有限的，團體的力量却是十分宏博的了。個人影響於社會很小，然而團體對於社會的影響，却是很大，假使我們組織了一個大規模的國貨消費合作社，凡是合作社的社員所消費的物品，都到合作社裏去買，那末，假使合作社有一百個社員，就有一百個人服用國貨，假使有一千個社員，就有一千個人服用國貨。以一百個人或是一千個人的一致行動，則對於社會的不良風尙上，將起如何廣大的影響呢？　　單獨的去和富於吸收性的不良環境相奮鬭，是很不容易的，唯有在團體的一致行動上，才能收到宏偉的效果！何况消費合作社的功效，還在免除消費上的浪費，將來合作社的盈餘，還可以按照了社員的購買額，分還給社員呢！　　個人認爲假使全國的婦女界，甚至全國的消費者，都能在各地組織起「國貨消費合作社」來，那末國貨運動的成功，是可計日而待了！國貨前途的兩項主要工作  玄萬　　高入雲霄的提倡國貨呼聲，在婦女國貨年中，忽忽地又將很響亮地喊過了二分之一的日子，但對於成績方面，似乎還没有什麽驚人的表現，而外貨的銷路，劣貨的進口，只要看國際貿易報告上的數字，就可知道他的依然如故，這難道是我們從事國貨事業者工作上的不努力嗎？没有勇敢和進行的精神嗎？我想，這都不是的，外貨深入我國社會，他是已有了很悠久的歷史，我們一旦要剷除這些魔障，自也非一朝一夕所可成功，同時，我們更須明瞭國貨衰落的生因，從大體上講，果是受外貨種種的壓制，而不能招頭，不過，照現在的形勢下，關於發展國貨的銷路，似尙有下列兩點的注意，而加以努力，或許也就是我們此後打開國貨新途徑最主要的工作吧！　　（一）全國農村的推銷　這一個問題，本來是誰也曉得，但，我因了這次的返里，格外使我感到深切與重要，原來我鄉是一個浙西的市鎭，交通上也還便利，可是，有一天，我竟因買一塊國貨肥皂而遍購不得，同時，又看到大街上幾家洋貨店裏，那家不是堆滿着充斥的洋貨，使我萬分地感到國貨前途的失望，都市裏儘自地震天價提倡國貨，而農村——乃至内地市鎭中竟如是：我以爲國貨當局此後對這點宜加努力注意。　　（二）國外貿易的開拓　記得在十年以前，我們不是還没有「入超」這名詞的發現嗎？究其原因，無非是因這時的大批出口貨還能抵過進口貨罷了，可是，年來以出口貨的日益减少，而入口貨却驚人增加，致大好金錢，年年滾入外洋，寗不可惜，自然，對於這點，也眞是殫精絶慮，急謀國貨出路者所急應注意的，我們此後將怎樣一方面力求舊出口貨的改良，像絲茶等，均須用新式方法，以來適合於各國爲準，和講求銷貨便利及推廣方法，一方面再極力於新出口貨的輸出，廣察各國需要，積極提倡，中國本是個地大物博的國家，一切成功之與否，本祗在自已之努力爲定耳，且據最提近實業部長陳公博氏從國外考察歸來之報告，像南洋一帶，因僑胞對於祖國傾向之熱烈，國貨之推銷該地，實尤有希望，而目下又適值「日貨到處碰壁」的時候，一定將更與予我們的便利與歡迎，到是一個不可多得的機會呢！國貨飲料  瑾蝶　　在這炎熱的夏天，解渴的問題比較吃飯的問題更要緊；你看這幾天市上的荷蘭水咧！鮮橘汁咧！都是利市三倍；但這些飲料大多數都是外國貨。　　古人説：「飲水思源」。但是我們現在爲了飲水，把金錢都送到外國人的腰包裏去，使得利權外溢，那豈不是飲鴆止渴嗎？　　如果化費幾角錢，到五洲藥房去買一瓶衛生菓子露，拿回家去就可以當作幾天的飲料；旣能節省金錢，又是提倡國貨，一舉兩得，何樂不爲呢。啟事　　張彰·魏詠箎·汪瘦秋·漁艇·何其憨·巴玲·茸餘·肖白·劍花·酉之·張孟昭·唐敦瑩·褚劍屏·士英·趙富魁·玄萬·曉芙·其疑·秋紅·倩紅·覺岸·全甲·藝生·競存·偉·怡怡館主諸君鑒，七月份承惠稿，甚感！現稿費已結算，請卽具條蓋章，於本月六日至十日，十六日至二十日，（星期日除外）向本館會計處領取爲荷。　　錢志坑·忘我·梁小鴻·張翊德·月玲·徐季摶·童素貞·盧荻諸君鑒，請卽補寄圖章，以便核對爲要。　　申報國貨周刊部啟婦女與國貨談座摩登婦女·覺悟吧！  導溱　　都市中的摩登婦女，矜恃着青春，儘情底享樂，妖艷其服着，盡浮蕩之能事，一天到晚坐汽車，看電影·跳舞……所謂坐的汽車，來路貨也，看的電影，歐美産也，跳舞吃香檳酒，舶來品也，洋氣十足，洋風凛凛，似乎不洋不足以擺其闊，不洋不足以顯其榮，我們祗要瞧一瞧過去國際貿易局的報告，謂化妝品香水脂粉等的消耗統計，在十個月的時期，進口數竟達一百卅九萬餘元；又據最近的報載：口香糖的國外輸入量，達二百餘萬元，試問這些消耗品閒食品的消耗者推銷者，又非摩登婦女誰屬？　　所以近幾年來，洋貨與摩登婦女，大有「相依爲命」之勢，洋貨借摩登婦女爲媒介，摩登婦女藉洋貨以求榮，這好像是循環的哲理，連瑣的比例：由此看來，要想和她們講提倡國貨，是無異於　對牛彈琴」，呌她們服用國貨，直不啻是這者諄諄而聽者藐藐；無怪乎日本人譏笑我們：「……卽輸入之舶來品，大部份在都會中消費，其間十之五六，全爲摩登婦女階級之裝飾消耗品……」（十六日本報載）　雖這寥寥數語，極譏諷之能事。　　都市中的摩登婦女們！我深盼望着你們趕快悔悟，及早回頭，否則，徒做了國貨的十惡不赦之罪魁，豈不遺臭萬年？要曉得，國貨的生命，期待着你們維護，婦女國貨年的成績，切盼着你們做起，你們的地位重要，責任鉅大，豈可等閒而視，眼看着婦女國貨年的階級，已過去了三分之一，已往的運動，似乎尙未收效，而日本人的譏諷，又頻起於後，但是，我們切不要因此而灰心，祗要我摩登的婦女們，痛除前非，糾正錯誤，抱「來者猶可追」的態度，今後以身作則的提倡服用國貨，實事求是的購買國貨，亡羊補牢，猶未晚也！潘唐冠玉夫人説得好；「國貨運動，不要灰心」，劉王立明夫人説：「……須知一種風氣的挽回，决不是短時期内可以實現，我們用多少力量，纔有多少收穫………更不要自嘆力量微弱渺小，就隨波逐流去

<p>自由談瘋狂與生存  稜磨　　人類對於生活的執着，有時是靠下意識來維持的。一個自殺者，也許就理智和感情着想，都再無生活，而下意識却能把他救轉來。瘋狂的人能冒着平常人所决不敢犯的危險而終於無恙，就因爲下意識總是維護他向生的路上跑的原故。　　可以使人自殺的原因，每每先可以使人瘋狂，而瘋狂後就不致自殺。採取一殺那就致命的手段自殺的人，那眞是所謂「短見」，這一種人多數並不骨並没有受到足够的激刺。我以爲在一個太過刺激的時代，瘋人一定多過自殺者。　　似乎我們也可以看到自殺者很多而並不多瘋人的社會。但那恐只是表面，當瘋狂成爲見慣不怪的狀態時，我們是再無從辨别什麽是瘋狂的。但我們知道，一個人通常所能忍受的痛苦，總有限度，能忍受限度以上的痛苦的，多少總是異態。　　賽會中流行的獻香，用鐵絲吊起香爐，把棒香的竹頭削尖揷入皮肉。據説並不痛苦，無疑地這種僅因爲從來没有人敢喊過痛，而後來者也雖有掩飾。不過我也樂於接受有人以爲是下意識（科學的心理學家所不承認的下意識）作用的解釋，因爲這就是説能這樣受苦的瘋狂。　　由對神們尊敬，就産生這類的瘋狂；同樣，别種的瘋狂，也是由對别種的尊敬而起。種種的束縳，種種的針刺的使人甘心忍受，都是利用人已産生了瘋狂心理。　　表面上，利用者與被利用者是同在束縳與針刺之中，瘋狂的程度也正相等。但利用者狡猾得多，他們所抱的尊敬，遠不及眞的瘋狂者。我不知道已陷於這種瘋狂者有多少，但生活在並不怎樣可麽幸的生存裏的，確已不少。小品生活  劉實君　　不獨「文」有小品，「生活」也有小品。　　事業的努力，革命的奮鬥，無疑的這不是小品生活，與杜思退益夫斯基的「罪與罰」或莎士比亞的「哈孟雷特」之不是小品文一樣的眞實。小品文是片斷的，却含有文字味；小品生活也是片斷的，却含有人生味。　　幾年前，我帶着五六歲的女兒阿竹住在妻的家裏·她家的門前有一小小的池塘，池塘上面搭着葡萄　，離離的葡萄一串串的懸在架下，那圓圓的翠玉　的碧天色，時時閃到孩子們的眼中：阿竹見了，要我去摘給她吃，我答道：「葡萄架下有很深的水，我一掉下去不會淹壞嗎？」她遂不要了。過了一會，我又故意的問：「阿竹，我去摘葡萄你吃罷？」同時就提脚向那兒走去，她連忙阻止我，並且説：「我不吃哩！我不吃哩！」妻知道了我的意思，説：「讓爸爸去摘來你吃不好哩？」她卽望着她的母親答道：「會掉到水裏哩。「妻又説：「讓他掉到水裏去淹壞好啦！」她竟拉着我不放手，而且扁着嘴要哭起來。那時，我沈醉在孩子的童心裏。　　這是小品生活。　　兩年前罷，我自安徽初來杭州，葆靈起森約我去游夜之西湖。那時是秋初，裏湖的荷花開得很茂盛，凉風一陣陣吹來淡淡的清香。天上籠罩着淡雲微月，湖濱隠約的顯了羣山的輪廓，那陰影，好似殘夢的模糊。我們談了一回别後的往事，遂同時沈默在那往事的黯澹與悲酸中。大概是南屏的幽鐘罷，也許是其他古寺，一聲聲的落到我們心頭：這鐘聲，不像學校上課鐘那樣接二連三的敲下去，它是慢慢的，起初聲音沈重，接着便拖出長而弱的餘音，等這嬝嬝不絶的餘音快要完全消失時，第二聲便發了出來；第二聲快消失，便又發出第三聲。那時，我們靜化在這自鳴自歇的鐘聲裏。　　這也是小品生活。　　這生活，是心靈的補品，是人生不可缺少的東西；農夫晚餐時孩子的一笑，工友散工後慈母的安慰或愛侣的溫存，都是這類。　　没有小品生活過的，是不幸的人生；完全過小品生活的，却也不是如何幸福。你們應當有這種生活的調劑，應當享受一點這樣的人生味；但是，我們却不能把整個的生命全沉溺於這種生活中。（一九三四，七，一九，於西湖）走廠調  李喬　　—鑛山通訊之三—　　在廠上的砂丁，以工作來區别，可分爲三種：一種是「下班」的，一種是「做草皮活」的，另一種是「揉粃子」的。　　這三種砂丁，不用説，是以「揉粃子」的來得比較好一些。當我措着沉重的兩口袋鑛砂，氣喘呼呼的從鑛洞裏爬出來時，望着他們盤坐在一間一間的草棚子裏，右手握着一丈來長的粃子杆，輕巧的在粃着「陡巢」（一）上的鑛砂。左乎拿着七八寸長的一根竹筒，嗖嗖地將水很均匀的戽到「陡巢」上去。丙手同時是這末巧妙的運動着，用不着什麽大力，但砂土和錫鑛便在這動作下分析開了。　　他們盤坐在草棚子裏工作着的　種悠然的神氣，令人望着不覺生羨！但這工作是很少有人會做的，所以他們的薪水反較「下班」的和「做草皮活」的還多。　　這裏工人的薪水没有一定的標準。有的每月可以得到四五十元舊滇票（二），有的只能得到一二十元，有的一文也不會得到。譬如像我這樣才初去學做的——十二三歲的孩子，是只望年終時，老板發了財，才會得到老板的幾文賞錢的。但倘若老板良心不好，發了財還説貼了本，那我的天，我們「到那時，不止我一人如此，連别的也要扣工錢了。」還會得到什麽呢？　　這裏每年是有着許多的人，做了一年的工，還不能得到老板的一文路費錢回家去的。－－因爲老板是在想扣留你替他多做幾年的工呀，他會對你説：「等發了財再回去」！　　但什麽時候才會發財呢？－－天曉得！　　「做草活」，比較起來，是再苦也没有的了，一天至少要有十一二點鐘的工作。可是這在「做草活」的人看來，却覺得比「下班」的還有一點好處：這好處就是能在草皮上伸一伸腰，得見一見光明的太陽。那是「下班」的人没有資格享受的好處。他們成天彎着腰，匍匐在黑暗的鑛洞裏，「牢塘」「吊井」隨時都在張着嘴等候着跌進去。「窠路」（三）倒塌也當時發生的。這種種不幸的事，都能使你在想不到的一刹那間將生命失去！所以這種「陰間討錢陽間使」的事情，是不大有人敢冒險做！雖然有些在被招來時説定是「下班」。但等到「下班」的時候，他望了一望那黑黝黝的洞口，便會颤抖着駭得不敢進去了。這是使人多麽恐怖喲！我初進鑛洞裏去，是一個熟習的同伴領着我去的。在未去之先，我也是同他一樣的打扮着：穿着嶄新的下班衣，頭上裹着長長的繞子，一盞明亮的煤氣燈揷在頭頂上，右耳朶旁也夾着一根刮汗片，懷着恐懼的心情，跟在他的屁股後，彎着腰，低着頭，慢慢的爬進去。　　我是怎樣在提心着我會跌下「牢塘」和「吊井」裹去呀，我幾乎不敢走快一步。那嶙峋的生着綠苔的隧石，那耀眼的岩鑛，都好像在嘲笑我這初來者似的，我羞怯怯的一眼也不敢望牠們，只戰戰兢兢的摸索着前進。………　　在出洞口來的時候，我是被那兩口袋鑛砂累得上氣不接下氣的倒在地上了。我把頭伏在蔴布褡褳上，汗一滴一滴的儘往下流，在喘息未安的那時，一聲幽怨的清音飛來我的耳裏：　　七月裏來七月七，　　手搬棚子眼涙滴！　　老鷹翻身葫蘆口，　　長蟲脱殻鑽岩底。　　呵，這是多麽感人而沉痛的音調呀！　　（註）（一）陡巢是用磚嵌成的，形如畚箕，（二）舊滇票是五元才能抵新滇票一元。（三）鑛洞就是窩路。（四）（五）這兩句是説在鑛洞裏，有時要如老鷹一般的翻了一個身，才會通過那狹窄的葫蘆口。有時要如長虫（即蛇）一般的匍匐着鑽到岩石底下。旱（續前日）  李輝英　　他們往水車所在的地方走去。　　太陽光透不到的地方，蚊蟲一團一團地飛舞着，有幾次險些飛進王阿興的老眼内。凉風依然拂蕩着，十分可人。有些水車，奏出它工作時的響聲——人們在車水了。半個多月以來，每天晚上，總是讓水車聲攪擾着全村的安靜，狗呌聲也只不過像蚊蟲呌喚嗡嗡嗡的一般渺小。　　「風怎麽不吹來幾陣雨呢」。　　「三官屯求了三天雨，爲什麽還求不來半塊雨曇！」　　「米又漲了二百錢，過幾天要打開一塊頭的關口。」　　「天老爺修修好罷，下一塲雨罷。」　　「河浜裏的水，只剩二尺深了，泥底子看得清清楚楚的。」　　「菜也漲價了。」　　爹兒兩個一邊走着，一邊聽到田裏别人的話語，其實這些話句句都是他們要説的，句句話對於他們都是需要的。　　天凉了。地上熱氣消失了。兩個人離開家門時原是帶着滿身飯後的熱汗的，到這時，停止了發散，但油漬的成分還没有减退。　　他們的鄰人阿黄，坐在水車棚底下看着老牛車水，趁這爹兒兩個從身前經過，搭上一句話：　　「你們兩個是車水去麽——你們的田還算好的呢。　　「謝你的吉言。」　　王阿興説完話，不願在這上面多躭誤工夫，就走過去了。他知道自已的田比别人的好在什麽地方，不是每天夜裏往田裏車水池比别人多車幾個鐘頭麽。兩個人，每夜都要在半夜後纔能回家，累的那種疲乏樣子，甚至連走回家的多餘力氣都没有了，身子也不是自已的身子了，而是變成了負在脚上千斤以上的重擔。　　看見别人的牛車水，王阿興想起自已的牛，去年他們是有一條牛來的，去年牛帮着作了好多事，去年收成也很好，偏怨榖價太低，好收成倒落得賠上了一條牛，償還從地東家借榖的債。現在没有牛了，天天用人來車水，天天把人的身子累得像年皮糖一般的軟。　　他們的脚，踏上水車的登板，開始了車水工作。　　田裏面，黑的地方漸漸的擴大了範圍。　　車着，車着，天漸漸黑下去了。他們的身上，出了大量的汗水，衣服緊緊地黏在身上，如果不是防備蚊蟲，他們不會再穿這些衣服的。　　隨着工作的前進，兩個人都感到些腿脚的酸痛，正在這時，水車花刺花刺的聲音變成伊吾伊吾的了。　　「爹，脚底下没有水上來呢。」　　兒子説完，就跳下水車去察看，在同一時間内，掀起一片驚人的呌喊聲，先是雜亂的，隨卽變成悽慘的：　　「河浜裏没有水了！」　　「水乾了！」　　「水乾了！水乾了，這可怎麽好！」　　天完全黑了。大衆語的幾個小問題  編者　　上月三十日，曹聚仁先生交來吳稚暉先生，討論大衆語問題的一封信（即昨天登出的「大衆語萬歲」），並另附一信説道：　　關於大衆語問題，儘是鑼鼓鬧台，不見袍笏登塲，也不是事。其實這個問題，單靠熱心是不够的，語文學上的專門知識，目前正十分需要。我最近提出幾個小問題，請國語研究會舊同人以及關心語文問題的先生們指示一點明確的意見。頃接吳稚暉先生覆信，其中所説，頗值得我們注意，請刊入自由談，公之大衆！　　信後更附着曹先生所徵求各家意見的幾個小問題：　　（一）大衆語文的運動，當然繼承着白話文運動國語運動而來的；究竟在現在，有没有劃分新階段，提倡大衆語的必要？　　（二）白話文運動爲什麽停滯下來？爲什麽新文人（五四運動以後的文人）隠隠都有復古的傾向？　　（三）白話文成爲特殊階級（知識分子）的獨占工具，和一般民衆並不發生關涉；究竟如何方使白話文成爲大衆的工具？　　（四）大衆語文的建設，還是先定了標準的一元國主羋，逐漸推廣，使方言漸漸消滅？還是先就各大區的方言，建設了多元的大衆語文，逐漸集中以造成一元的國語？　　（五）大衆語文的作品，用什麽方式寫成？民衆所慣用的方式，我們如何棄取。　　查大衆語問題在自由談中，自六月十八日陳子展先生提出，至七月五日爲止，發表過十三篇内容充實的文字，理論方面，發揮得似乎已經够了，所以宣告停登；但是，倘使不是「單靠熱心」而用「語文學上的專門智識」來講，那末，這問題似乎還是值得有再討論的必要。吳稚暉先生是中國研究語文學的老輩，就用他的一封信，來打破七月五日「擬停登」的宣告。　　至於曹聚仁先生向各家徵求的五個問題的意見，是曹先生個人的徵求，答覆的信件，欲自由談轉交，請在信封上寫明「轉曹聚仁先生」字樣，以免耽誤。　　（啓事）　馬星野先生的「我來自東」，本日因篇幅關係，未能登出，明日續登。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言硤石燈會與搶米  風　　據説硤石王店的燈彩是有歷史性的，而且有特具的藝術性，那些奇異燈彩確是十分可觀，硤石的父老們往往娓娓不倦的講述出燈時的情形。因爲牠是要經過許多年數，才能這樣熱鬧的幹一番，所以没有見識的後輩聽的時候也能心嚮往之。　　這可説是上海人的眼福，這些偉大的藝術品特地運到上海來給紳士們眼睛吃冰淇濂。那個古老的位在上海偏南的半淞園，在桃花怒放後就被人們遺忘了的現在重新車水馬龍起來；門票也從小洋二角而增至大洋半元，並且優待券及長券也恕不通融。另一方面，就顯出硤石燈彩是如何的名貴了。　　前某報記者訪問該會辦事人員，據云，單運費一項卽達八千元之鉅，可見他們對於這燈彩會費了不少精神與財力並不像祈雨法會的内幕那樣簡單。　　可是不幸得很，在這漪哉盛哉的燈彩會與上海人共樂的時候，報載硤石農民搶米風潮的消息。對照起來，是如何的大殺風景！　　這不知是否是硤石除外，查我們故鄉的出會出燈等習俗，是每值一次大豐收之後，農民在欣喜之餘，出會或出燈來謝神的。這裏我們不必談什麽科學問題，農民們是靠天吃飯的，天是他們的一切。　　現在這事實是如何的矛盾了，一方面農民窮得没有飯吃，於是挺而走險做出搶米的行動，而他方面郤把硤石的燈彩運到上海來開大會。以喜，無論他們是一種投機的營業，但是一萬餘元的來回運費，也够足數十萬人一天的生活了！　　然而這社會根本是個矛盾的社會，何獨硤石一隅如此，地獄與天堂像隔着一層板壁，許多人在火山上跳舞，許多人束緊了褲帶在出賣血液（見報載）。搶米的儘管儘搶米，燈彩我自出之。如果你放開眼來仔細看看，這社會上是充滿着這類矛盾的事實。看惯了也没有什麽希奇！文壇特寫  杞生　　投稿家這名詞並非我杜撰，時常有人應用，而其實也有這一種人：他們用的稿紙是印的自已版（卽注明某某人稿紙），寫成了文昌，又在稿子後頭蓋上了一個我屯，文曰：「稿如不用，請退回……一他的地址，寄出去的時候，稿子之外加上一個貼好郵票寫好自已地址的信封，預備給編輯家退回。而且寻那信封也不是普通的信封，是一個恰合寄稿之用的大封套，外面有的還印好自已的地址。投稿家博學多能，文藝作品如小説詩歌戲曲之外，政治的文藝的美術的社會問題的各種論文亦洋洋數千言，甚至外國影壇消息，汽車，建築，經濟，家政，醫藥等專刊的文章，他都寫得來。然而，只因目的在投稿，所以文章都是迎合某種雜誌及報紙副刊的編輯家的胃口而作，而結果没有一篇有價值的作品。投稿家終於只是投稿家，文壇上没有他的份兒，而他民没想到要在文壇上出風頭，他的目的在於領稿費，維持生活的。　　編輯家是由普通編輯訓練成功的，也不是一個凡人，他的本領是全靠剪子與漿糊，一本書一本書便在他的剪子與漿糊的工作之後出版。他在書局或報館當編輯的時候，成名作家的稿子亦不必看而付排，無名作家（如投稿家之流）的稿子不願意看而原封退回。成名作家的稿子不多，無名作家的稿子排山倒海而來，因此他編輯家大喊無稿可編，苦得很。　　無名作家旣受編輯家冷落，稿子常常被判决無期徒刑地不退回，或者甚至被判决死刑地投入字紙簍裏，牢騷憤恨便無時不想爆發，而文壇上攻擊編輯家之風成了時髦，有的編輯家因此反而利用這一種風氣，大喊提拔無名作家。但是咕呌只是喊呌，宣言發誓也還一句空話，他編輯家不過以此爲標奇立異地號召，收買人心，無名作家的稿子還是不見他提拔。於是乎無名作家於憤恨之餘，自已出版刊物了。此所以市上刊物如雨後春筍的緣故也。　　無名作家自已出版刊物，理應只是登載無名作家的稿子才對，但是事實上却有不然，無名作家一爲編輯，也大拉成名作家的稿子，以賣野人頭，對於無名作家的稿子一樣地判决無期徒刑與死刑。　　這是什麽緣故呢？原來我們生存着這社會是個人主義的制度的社會，制度在鼓勵個人英雄，人心也在崇拜個人英雄，成名作家已經成了英雄，自然他的</p>

<h3>British Troops Arrive at the Eastern Suburbs of Yuguan to Begin Combat Exercises</h3>
<p>Encamped Near Nine Gates</p>
<p>Exercises to Last a Total of Five Days</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stationed in Yuguan Also Conduct Street Fighting Exercises</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The military exercises by various countries' troops along the Great Wall line and the Japanese Kwantung Army's obstruction and negotiations remain unresolved. However, the British army is still proceeding with its planned exercises. On the 31st, British Commander Mackin led 200 infantrymen, eight machine guns, and two field guns to Erlang Temple east of Shanhaiguan at 2:00 PM, beginning combat exercises and encamping near Nine Gates. The exercises will last five days, ending on the evening of the 4th. The first day will be field warfare, the second day night warfare, the third day stronghold warfare, the fourth day artillery warfare, and the fifth day assault and capture warfare. On the 31st, British Commander Mackin informed the Shanhaiguan Special Public Security Bureau via letter regarding the location and subjects of the exercises, instructing them to notify the local residents not to be alarmed. Due to the British military exercises, the Japanese Kwantung Army garrison stationed in Yuguan is also conducting street fighting exercises within the city. From the 28th, the exercises take place daily from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM. During the exercises, troops rush along the streets, blocking traffic. Furthermore, on both sides of the main street outside the South Gate, they display war trophies seized from our side during the Great Wall battles for boasting. Throughout the day on the 31st, they fired blank rounds, the sound of which could be heard for several miles, in an ostensible confrontation with the British military exercises. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Yuguan British troop exercise incident, according to Japanese Legation Chargé d'Affaires Wakamatsu, there is no urgent need to resolve this problem and local incident. I previously met with First Secretary Holman of the British Legation and did not have any concrete contact. British Minister Knatchbull-Hugessen is currently in Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. When he returns to Beiping at the end of the month, the matter may be resolved incidentally during a meeting. Whether Holman has telegraphed Knatchbull-Hugessen for instructions regarding this matter, I do not know, nor is there a need to await his reply. The rumor that I am going to Beidaihe is not true.

<h3>Significant Developments in War Zone Negotiations</h3>
<p>North China May Maintain Temporary Stability</p>

This new agreement would include the Chahar East issue and the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops outside the Great Wall line, comprehensively resolving various outstanding issues in North China. The Japanese side's proposal seems to have an important political purpose, but it is rumored that Huang Fu has long had plans for this and the Japanese side will not find it difficult to comply. As for the postal and aviation customs establishment issue, the Japanese side has proposed a general outline for resolving postal communications, requesting Yin Tong to convey it to Huang Fu for his reference and research. They also hope to cooperate on aviation and the establishment of customs, with the Japanese side requesting preferential treatment for Japanese goods to promote economic cooperation, but there have been no concrete results. Regarding the war zone issue, the Japanese side has reportedly agreed to handle matters such as cracking down on Japanese ruffians and the Great Eastern Company's drug trafficking and gambling, reorganizing the security forces, and allowing the newly formed security forces to enter. Both sides have reached an understanding. (1st Dispatch)</p>

The Examination Yuan has already established various regulations and announced their implementation within its purview of what can be done regarding this issue. It is currently planning to expand various temporary examinations in addition to the regular examinations. For the provinces that have not yet held general examinations, it is also planning to urge them to hold them on a regular basis. Furthermore, regarding the improvement and promotion of administrative affairs, the agility of personnel metabolism, and making school education suitable for social needs, it is also planning to exchange opinions with various yuan, ministries, and committees to formulate practical plans and submit them to the Examination and Review Conference for discussion. Furthermore, the Examination Yuan has also given a very sincere response to the petition of Tan Shuqian, etc. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yang Hsiu-Chiung's entire family participated in the performance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital swimming competition opened at 3:00 PM on the 1st at the Central Stadium swimming pool, followed by various preliminary rounds. Yang Hsiu-Chiung's entire family participated in the performance.

The competition ended at 8:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The rostrum was at the southern end of the swimming pool, with a canopy to shield from the intense sun. The table displayed many prizes, such as silver cups and silver tripods.

The chairman of the preparation committee, Chu Minyi, presided and led the audience in a salute. He then reported the significance of the meeting, briefly stating that swimming is one of the most beneficial sports for physical and mental health, so we particularly promote it.

<p>Performance by Yang and Others: After the 200-meter breaststroke was completed, the Yang family was invited to perform. The audience was extremely tense at this time, all wanting to see Yang's grace.

Next, Zhang Yuanhua, an instructor from the military academy, performed a 100-meter swim with his hands and feet bound, displaying superb technique. Then, Yang Hsiu-Chiung and her younger brother, Yang Changhua, performed a 100-meter freestyle swim together. The audience applauded continuously, and everyone took photos. The reporters were also very busy. Yang Hsiu-Chiung's swimming posture was exquisite, and her performance seemed effortless. Her younger brother Changhua was light and natural. At this time, the entire stadium erupted in thunderous applause. At the request of the audience, Yang and her younger brother continued with a 100-meter breaststroke performance. Their style was even more natural, especially their fast and nimble turning technique, which was quite unique. After the performance, it was already past 7:00 PM, and Yang and others left the pool to change clothes.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Heng on China's National Defense Problems</h3>
<p>The inevitability of a second World War is becoming increasingly clear today. That China will inevitably be drawn into the vortex can be known without divination. If China does not promptly rise up to plan for national defense construction, then when an incident breaks out in the future, not only will there be no possibility of exploiting the international situation or recovering the Northeast, but even seeking a neutral position will be impossible. Therefore, the result is that we can only allow others to invade our territory and plunder our resources, using our country as a battlefield. No matter which side wins, it will not benefit us. On the contrary, if China already has national defense construction, then from a proactive perspective, we can take advantage of the situation and changes in the international landscape as a foundation for future strength and progress. From a passive perspective, we can also strictly adhere to neutrality, avoiding the subjugation of our land by foreign powers. Today, if our country seeks to ensure the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, neither being controlled by one country nor being divided by various countries, we must strengthen our self-defense capabilities. There is no other way to seek this. Therefore, based on my limited understanding, I will briefly discuss the key points of national defense construction in the future.</p>
<p>First, develop transportation. After the September 18th Incident, Chinese troops had considerable resistance in Rehe, the Great Wall, and Shanghai. However, failure was unavoidable. Although the reasons are complex, the inconvenience of transportation and the slowness of replenishment were fatal. In recent years, the government has been working hard to develop highways, which seems to be a shortcut to remedy this shortcoming. However, although highways can be built as much as possible, their effectiveness is limited. For the sake of developing China's economic resources and for the sake of future national defense, the active construction of railways is urgent. Although highways are useful, railways are even more useful. Highways are only the capillaries of a country, while railways are the arteries. We cannot hesitate because highways are easy to build and railways are costly.</p>
<p>Second, develop heavy industry. Countries with developed production defeat nations with backward production. This has become an iron law of modern international warfare. Among industries, the one most closely related to national defense is heavy industry. The reason why Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan became a national defense plan is that the industry it developed was heavy industry. Germany's national defense strength is far inferior to France's. However, when Germany demanded military equality, France became alarmed because Germany is a country with a developed heavy industry. During the last World War, the daily cost of ammunition for the belligerent countries reached a huge sum of 19 million US dollars. They were not depleted after four years because the belligerent countries all had strong heavy industries. The reason why Russia failed and had a revolution was due to the insufficient development of its industry compared to Western European countries. Therefore, in modern warfare, without a foundation of heavy industry, defeat can be predicted. The reason why China endures humiliation and cannot compete with Japan for even a day is also due to this. This is what China should pay close attention to in order to cope with the great disaster in the future.</p>
<p>Third, build arsenals, aircraft factories, and shipyards. After heavy industry is developed, it can supplement the inadequacy of military industry in peacetime, and it can also be converted into military industry in wartime. During the European War, all countries coped in this way. However, in peacetime, the two have their own missions and cannot be mixed. Therefore, it is still necessary to set up arsenals, aircraft factories, and shipyards specifically. Although China currently has several arsenals and one or two shipyards, the equipment is simple and far from self-sufficient. Once an international war breaks out and the sources are cut off, there is a danger of being helpless. As for aircraft, we rely entirely on foreign supply. Future wars will be determined by air warfare. If China does not plan for self-sufficiency early, how will it cope with the great difficulties in the future? This is truly worrying. All these kinds of military industries must be built as soon as possible to avoid regret. Fourth, transform soldiers into civilians and civilians into soldiers. Our country is known in the world for its soldiers, but it is not strong. Switzerland, a small country, only has 500 soldiers in peacetime, but the powerful countries of Europe do not dare to invade it. What is the reason? China has 2 million soldiers, and that's all. Switzerland, in addition to the 500 soldiers in peacetime, has a huge reserve force of 600,000. The population of Switzerland is 4 million, and its actual combatants reach 600,000, accounting for 15.5% of the total population. China's population is 400 million, and its actual combatants are only 2 million, accounting for 0.45% of the total population. Proportionally speaking, the number of combatants is more than 30 times smaller than Switzerland's. How can we not be despised? Other examples include Soviet Russia, which has 15 million reservists; France, which has 6.33 million reservists; and Italy, which has 6 million reservists. Their number of standing soldiers is far less than ours. From this, it can be seen that the way to national defense does not lie in having many soldiers in peacetime, but in having many reservists. If a country exhausts its strength to raise soldiers, and feels insufficient in wartime, it is better to have fewer soldiers in peacetime and more soldiers in wartime. In recent years, the authorities have paid considerable attention to military training, and their intention is clearly to train reservists. However, the scope is limited to students, so the talent selection seems too small. According to the Swiss proportion, China must have 65 million reservists. If it is limited to students, what can it do? Therefore, I hope that the authorities will expand the scope to achieve the goal of having all citizens as soldiers. As for the current Chinese army, after the bandit suppression is completed, we should find ways to gradually return them to farming and industry to help the country's construction. I heard that Chairman Chiang already has a plan to reduce the national army to 50 divisions. If this plan can be successful, then most of the soldiers can be transformed back into civilians, which can reduce the burden on the national treasury and help the country's production. At the same time, it can also enable the government to devote all its efforts to the construction of national defense military equipment. Nothing could be better. However, what I think should be noted is that before the soldiers are laid off, they must have a skill. It is best to have a fixed job and then lay them off. Otherwise, the so-called demobilization is no different from driving them to take risks, which is not a good way to transform soldiers into civilians.</p>
<p>The above four points are not easy to implement. They will not be accomplished in one or two years. However, preparing early and starting early will certainly be better than not preparing or starting. If a world war does not break out within one or two years, or even extends to more than ten years later, then our preparations will certainly be sufficient and considerable, and we will have nothing to fear. If it breaks out in a short period of time, then we will also have considerable preparation, which will be better than having no confidence at all.</p>
<h3>President Hindenburg, the Mainstay of Germany, is Critically Ill</h3>
<p>Hitler Rushed to His Bedside</p>
<p>Representing the People to Express Condolences</p>
<p>Neudeck President Hindenburg's condition is gradually deteriorating, and silence reigns in his villa. The President's relatives and senior government officials have gathered from all over today, awaiting the end of the long life of Europe's heroic statesman in a quiet atmosphere. Prime Minister Hitler arrived here by plane at 1:15 PM. This morning in Berlin, Hitler frequently inquired about the President's villa by telephone. When the attending physician informed him that the President's condition was critical and that if he did not rush here by plane, he might not be able to see the President, Hitler followed his advice. At 8:30 AM today, the attending physician issued a statement saying that although the President was able to sleep peacefully last night, his condition was gradually worsening, his mind was still clear, and his pulse was weakening. The news of the President's critical illness has caused deep concern throughout the country. The President's health problems have been heard of for several days. The entire country not only respects the President as the father of the country, but also regards him as the mainstay of German history. The scenery of the President's villa is beautiful. Visitors came this morning, and the family flag is flying on the roof, still expressing welcome. Nearby, thirty cows raised by President Hindenburg are grazing in the beautiful sun and breeze. However, once inside the villa, the situation is completely different. Everyone has a worried face, and the scene inside the house is also very bleak. (National Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Hindenburg, who has been serving as the President of Germany since 1925, is in critical condition and may die at any time. According to a Reuters dispatch from Neudeck, the news of President Hindenburg's critical illness came suddenly, and everyone was greatly shocked. Just two days ago, someone saw him walking around the grounds of his home and taking a car ride around Neudeck with his daughter-in-law. In addition to the four male doctors treating him, there is also the famous female physician Professor Bergman by his side. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prime Minister Hitler arrived in Neudeck this afternoon. A communique at 1:45 PM stated that Hitler went to the President's bedside to express his personal wishes and the wishes of the German people for his speedy recovery. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Increased Severity After Surgery</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to official sources, President Hindenburg's condition suddenly worsened at 5:00 PM this afternoon. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna According to a message at 11:00 PM, German President Hindenburg's condition worsened after undergoing surgery this morning. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Yesterday Afternoon's Communique Said His Mind Was Still Clear</h3>
<p>The communique issued at 8:30 AM this morning stated that although President Hindenburg was peaceful at night, he was becoming weaker, with no fever and a weaker pulse. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon's communique stated that President Hindenburg's condition has not changed, and his mind is very clear. He ate some food at noon. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Relying on Good Health and Disbelieving in Medicine</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The President's illness is indeed in the prostate, but he has severe asthma, and part of his body is numb. The President felt slightly unwell about a week ago, but it was not a big problem at first. However, the old man relied on his good health and disliked medicine. He often disobeyed the doctor's warnings. Once, he even ordered his main doctor to leave the room. Later, after suffering for too long, he had to receive medical treatment, and he lay in bed cursing the general doctors, grumbling endlessly. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Prime Minister Hitler received the news of the President's critical illness and returned to Berlin from Bayreuth, and convened a cabinet meeting today. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Does Not Lose His Status as Head of State</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political circles here believe that German Prime Minister Hitler, whether he is President or not, will actually be the head of state of Germany. Other speculations can be regarded as conjecture and discarded. The Deutsche Zeitung openly declared today that Hitler will succeed Hindenburg as President. Although this statement represents the general opinion of all sectors of Germany, the newspaper was punished with a one-week suspension for making this statement. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The current German constitution (which the Nazi Party did not declare abolished after taking power, so it is still in effect) stipulates the method of succession for the President in Article 51 as follows: When the President is unable to perform his duties due to any reason, the Prime Minister shall first perform his duties. If the President is unable to perform his duties for a considerable period of time, laws may be formulated separately to designate a candidate for acting. If the President leaves office before the end of his term, the method of succession shall be the same until a new President is elected. Therefore, according to the constitutional provisions, if President Hindenburg leaves office due to illness, Prime Minister Hitler may perform the duties of President until a new President is elected. The new President is directly elected by all German citizens, and anyone over the age of 35 has the right to vote. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>National Worry Over the Great Disaster in the Future</h3>
<p>(Berlin) President Hindenburg slept peacefully in his Neudeck palace today, but this 87-year-old man has little hope of prolonging his life. People from all walks of life in Germany were panicked when they heard that the President was critically ill. When the news of the President's death spread this afternoon, there were many people crying on the roadside in Berlin. This is not only because Hindenburg is old and virtuous, and his reputation is high, but also because Germany has lost this mainstay, and the great disaster in the future is particularly worrying. The German people all know that since the June 30th Incident and the tragic death of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, domestic and foreign troubles have come one after another, and the Nazi Party's rule is in crisis. If Hindenburg dies at this time, Germany's troubles will increase, and the future cannot be foreseen. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Current Problems in Austria</h3>
<p>Purging Internal Affairs and Adjusting Relations with Germany</p>
<p>Vienna Austria is currently facing two major problems: purging internal affairs and adjusting relations with Germany. The Austrian situation is now dominated by these two issues. Active cleansing measures have now begun. Civil servants and primary school principals in Styria and Carinthia, the two provinces where the Nazi Party's rebellion was most intense, have been completely replaced, and the police administration is also undergoing reorganization. Many arrests have been made. The government is clearly trying to eliminate any opposition forces that have a little power. Former Austrian Ambassador to Italy, Rintelen, who was arrested here for being involved in the rebellion and attempted suicide, is now gradually recovering from his gunshot wound and is telling people what he knows about the rebellion. The Austrian authorities hope to clarify the relationship between Germany and this rebellion based on his announcement. At the same time, Austrians' criticism of Germany has doubled, pointing out that the Germans instigated the incident. Flyers have been posted on utility poles throughout Vienna today, saying, "We denounce the true murderers who sit safely outside the border." (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Vienna Today, the Austrian government's official newspaper published an article saying that when the new German Ambassador von Papen arrives, he must end the Nazi Party's anti-Austrian propaganda and recognize Austria's demands, namely, that Austrian military personnel not be allowed to exist in German territory. This is clearly a firm condition for the Austrian government to accept von Papen as the German ambassador. Von Papen's appointment as the German ambassador to Austria has caused much criticism in Europe, especially in Italy. The Italians said that Hitler did not ask Austria whether it welcomed him before announcing von Papen's appointment as the ambassador to Austria. This extraordinary procedure is contrary to diplomatic customs. The Austrian government formally notified Germany on July 28 that it welcomed von Papen as the new ambassador to Austria. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia After the failure of the Austrian Nazi Party rebels' riot, more than 3,500 people who retreated into Yugoslavia from Austrian territory have been banned and are in detention camps. It is reported that 2,000 rebels disarmed by the Yugoslav authorities will be sent to Macedonia, and there is no question of sending them back to Austria. As for the trucks and cars used by the rebels to escape, they may be returned to the Austrian authorities. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Rome The Austrian situation has now improved. Officials here believe that the troops concentrated on the Austrian border can be expected to withdraw soon. The army exercise, which has been announced for several weeks, will take place in northern Italy, adjacent to the Austrian border. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Vienna Police found a list in the hotel belonging to former Austrian Ambassador to Italy, Rintelen. The list listed the candidates for the new cabinet that was planned after the rebels succeeded, including Prime Minister Rintelen, Deputy Prime Minister Hapich (the Austrian Nazi Party inspector, who was expelled by the Austrian government and dismissed by Hitler after the Vienna incident), Foreign Minister Hugelmann (Professor at the University of Vienna), Army General Wagen (President of the Austrian Aviation Association), Public Security Brandel (Former Vienna Police Chief), Education Professor Zusenbach, Propaganda Ferunfeld (Former leader of the Austrian Nazi Party), Commerce Apel (Director of the Styria Metallurgical Bureau), Social Affairs Dr. Neubach (President of the German-Austrian Union for the Promotion of Cooperation). Among them, Rintelen, Hugelmann, Wagen, Apel, and Neubach have been arrested. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>

<p>Japan Holds Major Air Defense Exercise (Japan Communication)</p>
<p>Extraordinary Preparations for Three-Dimensional Warfare</p>
<p>The Most Extensive Collaboration Between the Navy and Army</p>
<p>In modern warfare, especially after the development of air warfare, there is naturally no distinction between front and rear in the sense of economic warfare. The entire country and the entire national economy are all involved in the vortex of war, with no room for leisure. This situation is even more serious after the development of air forces. Economic warfare does not necessarily lead to the danger of sacrificing lives. Air raids will stop all work in the rear and threaten the safety of the general society. During the European War, London was attacked more than 100 times, with the enemy dropping more than 4,800 bombs from airplanes, resulting in nearly 5,000 casualties. However, we know that British buildings are mostly made of brick and stone, which should have considerable resistance. Moreover, at that time, the accuracy of airplane bombing and the explosive power of bombs were not fully developed. Now, however, it is very different. All efficiencies have increased. Moreover, ordinary Japanese houses are made of wood and paper, with low resistance effectiveness and high air raid efficiency. Therefore, she is very fearful, fearing that once the enemy's air force attacks, her several industrial centers will inevitably turn into scorched earth.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States is preparing to build air force bases on the Aleutian Islands, and the Soviet Union has a large airfield near Vladivostok. These are all materials that increase Japan's fear and are her greatest future shortcomings in foreign operations.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also a motivation for this major exercise. The exercise area includes Osaka, Kyoto, Wakayama, Mie, Nara, Shiga, and other two prefectures and four counties, as well as parts of Hyogo and Fukui. All troops stationed in these areas, such as the 16th Reserve Division in Kyoto (the main force has been dispatched to the Northeast), the 4th Division in Osaka, the 9th Division in Kanazawa, and the 10th Division in Himeji, are mobilized to prepare for air defense. The naval fleets along the coasts of Osaka and Kobe also participated unanimously. In addition, civil organizations in these areas, such as the Veterans Association, schools, government offices, fire brigades, youth groups, factory protection groups, and national defense women's associations, are all mobilized to engage in air defense activities.</p>
<p>The scope of air defense is centered on Osaka City. The first line is 150 kilometers from the central area, where sound machines, anti-aircraft machine guns, and so on are installed. The area from 150 to 70 kilometers from the center is called the air defense surveillance area. A surveillance network is organized here to monitor the direction of enemy aircraft. If convenient, it will be shelled. The area from 70 to 45 kilometers from the inside is called the aircraft battle zone, where more precise sound detectors are installed, which can detect the source, path, and current location of enemy aircraft. If it is at night, it has searchlights that can suddenly illuminate enemy aircraft in the area heard by the sound detector, so that it can be bombarded with anti-aircraft guns, or its own aircraft can easily attack it. If the enemy guesses this layer and uses ultra-high-altitude flight or ultra-low-altitude flight to avoid anti-aircraft guns, it will be easy to fly into the central area to carry out its bombing work. Therefore, there are two special devices, one is a blocking balloon to prevent enemy aircraft from advancing, its function is similar to that of mines in the sea, so that enemy aircraft dare not fly at low altitude, and the other is to release smoke screens to protect the houses in the city, so that the enemy cannot drop bombs, even if they drop them, they cannot hit its key points.</p>
<p>Now, air raids and defenses are becoming more sophisticated. It is actually very difficult and easy to fail to attack a city during the day. Therefore, air raids are mostly at night, and the target is light, so managing the lights is a particularly important thing. The lights must be extinguished very quickly under certain orders. All street lights, advertising lights, and door lights must be extinguished. The lights in the station must also be extinguished. Street lights are changed to one every 80 meters and must not exceed 100 candlepower. The headlights of cars and trams are only allowed to use 10 candlepower or less and must be turned on with the shutters closed. Other indoor lights must also be restricted and masked.</p>
<p>The people are working very hard for the air defense exercise, with a strong wartime atmosphere. However, there have only been six or seven enemy aircraft attacking in the sky in the past two days. Such preparation is naturally effective. If there are dozens or hundreds of aircraft attacking, I don’t know what will happen. Her hypothetical enemy this time is from the sea, so there is also an act of detonating model ships. Although the ground is very tense, the air does not seem very serious. (July 28, Osaka)</p>
<p>Nanchang Rice Prices Soar</p>
<p>Rural Refugees in Wuning County Flee in Large Numbers</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Since last month, Jiangxi Province has been experiencing prolonged sunny weather with no rain. In the outer counties, the rice in the countryside has withered and dried up, and drought disasters have been reported. It is known that Wuning County is also suffering from drought. All the rice in the countryside has yielded no harvest. Moreover, there is no late rice planting in the county's farmland, resulting in general farmers not having enough food to eat and fleeing in large numbers. In recent days, those arriving in the province to request resettlement at the city's docks have occurred several times a day, reaching hundreds of people. According to the farmers who fled to the province, the county is suffering from a severe disaster. Rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood as cinnamon. Farmers are starving to death and have no way to make a living. They can only try to survive in all directions. Fortunately, miscellaneous grains such as millet and sweet potatoes have been sown in various rural areas, but if it does not rain again, it is feared that they will also wither and die. Then there will be more refugees fleeing abroad in the future.</p>
<p>It is also reported that since the city has been suffering from drought, rice prices have been rising step by step. In order to maintain people's food and suppress rice prices, the Provincial Public Security Bureau once summoned Luo Zhushan, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, and ordered him to inform his colleagues not to raise prices again. However, recently rice prices have been soaring even more fiercely. Last Wednesday, the price of late rice was 9 yuan and 4 jiao per dan, but yesterday it rose to 10 yuan and 3-4 jiao. Retail prices also rose, selling for about 350-60 text per liter. Early rice also costs about 9 yuan per dan and is expected to remain strong. The market price of new grains has recently been about 3 yuan and 7-8 jiao per dan, causing general poor people to look worried. If it does not rain again within ten days, the price of rice per dan will inevitably reach 12 yuan. (July 31)</p>

<p>Yongding River Water Rises, Tianjin Haihe River Silts Up</p>
<p>Ships with Deeper Drafts Cannot Come to Tianjin</p>
<p>The Corps of Consuls Sends a Note to Our Side, Urging Speedy Dredging</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: At the beginning of this month, the water level of the Yongding River rose sharply. The upstream carried mud and sand, and the current was rapid, flowing into the Haihe River. This caused the mud and sand to settle, and the riverbed gradually silted up. The Haihe River Engineering Office originally had a control gate built at Qujiadian in the suburbs of Tianjin to control the confluence of the Yongding River into the Haihe River, clarifying the river water and allowing muddy water to enter the Grand Canal, while clean water was diverted into the Haihe River through the new channel, so as to prevent the Haihe River from silting up. This has been quite effective over the years, and the dredging work of the Haihe River Engineering Bureau has also been greatly reduced. Unexpectedly, during this month, the water level of the Yongding River rose sharply. The water level at Qujiadian was higher than the dikes. Dozens of villagers, including Wang Qinzhuang, destroyed the dikes of Qujiadian at night to protect their villages, causing the control gate set up by the Haihe River Engineering Office to lose its effectiveness. The water flowed into the Haihe River through the old channel, and the Haihe River gradually silted up over half a month. As of now, the banks of the wharves in the British, French, and Japanese concessions have been silted up by hundreds of feet, and the water depth is only two or three feet. At high tide, it is only four or five feet. Due to the rapid flow of water, it silts up by seven or eight inches in one day. The dredging work of the Haihe River Engineering Bureau cannot be carried out. Ships with a draft of more than eight feet have not been able to sail to Tianjin Port since the 10th. After the 20th, even ships with a draft of more than five feet cannot enter. Only tugboats and sailing boats travel between Tianjin and Tanggu every day. Ships sailing to Tianjin from various ports all use Tanggu as a wharf for passengers to embark and disembark. Passengers coming to Tianjin disembark and transfer to the Beining Railway. Goods coming to Tianjin are loaded by tugboats, and a fee of 2 yuan and 5 jiao and 4 cents per ton is publicly set. All parties feel this is inconvenient. The Tianjin Corps of Consuls believes that our side manages the Haihe River and has an engineering office and an engineering bureau, and levies additional taxes on the Haihe River as a long-term mechanism for dredging the Haihe River. Now that the riverbed is shallow and foreign ships cannot enter, the burden has not been removed, and the losses have increased. It is believed that the Haihe River Engineering Office and the Haihe River Engineering Bureau must be held responsible. On the 29th, the consuls held a special meeting at the German Consulate, the leader of the Corps of Consuls, to discuss the methods of negotiation. It was decided to jointly issue a note, which was sent to our side on the 30th, to call our attention to the silting of the Haihe River and to expedite repairs so that ships can sail to Tianjin. The British Taikoo Company and the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company also plan to send letters to the Haihe River Engineering Office and the Engineering Bureau jointly after the Corps of Consuls issues the note. The purport is the same as that of the Corps of Consuls, urging the two bureaus and offices to expedite the construction work. The Hebei Provincial Engineers Association issued a long telegram on the 28th regarding the silting of the Haihe River, the overflowing of the Yongding River flood, and the failure of the Qujiadian control mechanism. It stated that the Yongding River should be fundamentally managed, otherwise the riverbed will silt up, and there is a risk of collapse when the flood season arrives. The Haihe River is silting up, and it will be difficult for the riverbed to rise over time. If ships cannot enter, and the dikes on both sides are washed away, it is also expected. The telegram has been sent to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the National Economic Commission, the Beiping Political Consolidation Committee, the Hebei Provincial Government, and other agencies.

<p>Overview of the Drought in Anhui Province</p>
<p>Installing Water Pumps to Irrigate Farmland</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices Cause Concern for People's Food</p>
<p>Prayers for Rain Are Ineffective, Villagers Flock to the City</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: Since the beginning of summer, the weather in Anhui Province has been extremely hot, with very little rainfall. The indoor temperature has reached a maximum of 109 degrees. Although there were some light showers on the 19th and 20th, the total amount was only one millimeter. The climate was slightly cooler, dropping to around 90 degrees, but it was still of no help to agricultural affairs. In recent days, the weather has returned to being extremely hot, with the maximum temperature being 103 degrees. This kind of extremely hot and dry weather is the only one seen in Anhui Province in the past 60 years. And this year's drought has spread almost all over the province. Now, based on recent observations, it is described as follows:</p>
<p>Diverting Water to Irrigate Fields: Prolonged drought and lack of rain have caused farmland to crack. Huaining, Tongcheng, and other counties are particularly in need of rain. The Construction Department recently established a drought prevention committee to plan relief and issued orders to various counties to instruct them on drought prevention work. For the sake of temporary solutions, the method of opening dikes to divert water for irrigation by the villagers in the polders was formulated. First, it was started in the provincial capital. It was planned to open the Guangji Polder's Meiling Gate and the Dahu Gate at the northern end of the Huguo Polder in Anqing's downstream more than 30 miles to irrigate the fields. All of this was ordered by the Water Conservancy Engineering Office to conduct surveys with the county. The areas near the Guangji Polder and Huguo Polder near the provincial capital have a large number of fields. The department has also sent personnel to conduct surveys and assess the terrain. Water pumps will be installed in the San Kong Qiao area outside the East Gate of Anqing to facilitate irrigation. The Provincial Electric Light Plant was also ordered to find ways to install electric water pumps at the Songqing Pavilion on the Jiangbian Liujiao Pavilion outside the East Gate to use electricity to divert water to irrigate the fields in Huguo Polder and Linghuzui, so that it can gradually irrigate the boundary of Tongcheng. In addition, the Provincial Public Security Bureau and various fire brigades will borrow ten "田雞龍" pumps to draw water from the Songqing Pavilion at the Sanbei Wharf outside the East Gate to irrigate the fields. The Construction Department previously sent technician Pan Xueqiu to Suzhou to purchase four water pumps for use in Anhui. It is now planned to install water pumps at the Meiling and Dahu gates of Guangji Polder because the river water level is low and cannot be opened, so as to provide relief.</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices: The province's rice supply has always relied on farmers from nearby townships to transport it in old-fashioned single-wheeled carts. Since the opening of the Anhe Road, rice from Gahepu and other places has been transported by cars. However, due to the high transportation costs, no one dared to try it. In total, the city needs about 80 shi of rice per day. Recently, due to the impact of the drought, various townships have banned the export of rice. A few days ago, a villager from a certain place transported more than 70 shi of rice, intending to sell it in the province. When he reached the Hongjiapu area, more than 60 miles away from the province, the local rice merchants bought it all at the latest market price in the province. If it continues to be bought, the impact will be huge. The rice merchants in the provincial capital, such as Hefengyu, who have slightly more financial resources, are taking advantage of the opportunity of reduced supply to hoard and speculate, raising market prices. The price of upper-class rice has risen to around ten yuan per shi, about twice as much as the usual market price. They are also using new measuring instruments, which is like giving another 10% discount, making even more profit. Other wheat flour and other grains are also taking the opportunity to rise in price every day, putting poor people in an increasingly desperate situation.</p>
<p>Social Situation: At the beginning of the drought, the Provincial Public Security Bureau issued a notice to break superstitions, banning prayers for rain. At that time, only a small number of children carried paper sedan chairs with dragon god tablets and paraded in the streets. They were stopped by the police on duty, and a conflict occurred. Then, the scorching sun ravaged the land, and the drought became more severe. Charitable organizations and Buddhist associations in the province have all built altars and recited scriptures, prostrating and worshiping. Farmers from various townships have formed groups and entered the city to petition, carrying the image of the dragon god on their shoulders and withered crops on their heads. The military police were unable to suppress them due to public opinion. Then, in response to the people's requests, the Public Security Bureau and the County Government jointly issued a notice banning slaughter for a total of six days. Zhang Benshun, Director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, Sun Peifang, Magistrate of Huaining County, and many gentry and merchants went to the Dragon King Temple on Dalong Mountain, 30 miles away from the province, to offer incense and pray for rain. This is a rare phenomenon since the 16th year of the Republic of China. Recently, prayers for rain have been ineffective and have become silent. However, villagers from various places have come to the city to find food due to the drought and wasteland, and the residents of the provincial capital are also looking worried. (July 30)</p>
<p>The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Revision Treaty Negotiations Conclude</p>
<p>The Draft Treaty Has Been Signed by Representatives of Both Sides</p>
<p>The Formal Contract Must Wait for the Government to Sign</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The negotiations on the revision of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway contract have been held several times in Hong Kong by representatives of both China and Britain. It has been agreed that the distribution of benefits from the direct through trains on the railway will be changed to 72% for the Chinese side and 28% for the British side. Compared with the previous ratio of 65% and 35%, our side will increase its benefits by 7%. In addition, the meetings that have been held have been very confidential. The Chinese and British representatives have kept secret the issues discussed. It was not until the final negotiations on the 25th that the new treaty's English and Chinese texts were revised and completed. The treaty revision meeting has come to an end. All points regarding the definition of joint transport on the railway, technical cooperation, and traffic rules have been detailed in the draft treaty. After further review by the Chinese representative Cao Jiefu and the British representative Hoggart, all procedures have been completed, and the draft treaty has been printed in six copies, which will be taken back by the representatives of both sides to be reviewed by their respective authorities. If no further revisions are made, it is expected that the draft treaty will be signed on the 28th. The persons responsible for signing the draft treaty are Zhang Weici, representative of the Ministry of Railways, Hu Dongchao, Director of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, Li Xian'gen, Director of the Yuehan South Section Railway Bureau, Hoggart, Director of the British Section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Cairns, Legal Advisor to the Hong Kong Government, and Blin, Director of the Postal Service. After the draft treaty is signed, it will be formally signed by the Chinese and British governments to become a formal contract. (July 26)</p>

<p>People's Car Guild Representatives Petitioned the City Government Yesterday Morning. Gu Songmao and Three Others Brought a Petition Seeking Assistance. Zhu Yaowen Met with Them and the City Government Promised to Provide as Much Assistance as Possible. The Attitudes of Both Sides are Firm, and the Trend is Worsening. According to Xin Xin News Agency, the problem of rickshaws in this city has, since the工部局 (Public Works Department) decided to change the new regulations, caused rickshaw operators to believe that the new regulations promulgated by the bureau are extremely unreasonable and difficult to comply with. After raising objections, both sides insisted strongly. Recently, the trend has been worsening. Yesterday, representatives of the rickshaw operators went to the City Government to petition for assistance in negotiating with the工部局. The details are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3>Petition Situation</h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, the Rickshaw Industry Association specially dispatched representatives Gu Songmao, Liang Ruiting, Zhang Huairang, etc., carrying a petition to the Municipal Government in the city center to petition Mayor Wu. Zhu Yaowen received them on his behalf. The representatives stated that the problem was becoming increasingly serious, affecting the livelihoods of 500,000 rickshaw pullers and greatly affecting social security. They requested the Municipal Government to provide assistance. Zhu stated that the Municipal Government has always been very concerned about the livelihoods of the common people. He would convey the message to the Mayor and provide as much assistance as possible. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Petition to the City Government</h3>
<p>The petition from the rickshaw operators to the City Government stated, "(Excerpt) Because the rickshaw industry is being destroyed and the rickshaw pullers are being exploited, we respectfully state the reasons and request substantial assistance to avoid major disputes. Human-powered rickshaws in this city have a long history of several decades. Through the diligent efforts of the industry, their past achievements have been directly linked to the prosperity of the city and the adjustment of life. Therefore, today, hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly rely on them for a living. All facilities have not been criticized by people in society for any inconvenience. Therefore, the authorities should carefully consider any measures to reform the industry to ensure the stability of the industry's livelihood and achieve effective results. However, due to the increase in rickshaw prices, which is the result of social progress and its own efforts, a small number of ambitious people have coveted it. After repeatedly negotiating with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, they made exaggerated claims. Last year, they organized a so-called Rickshaw Research Committee to discuss the matter. They also adopted various unreasonable suggestions of the committee to improve vehicles and help rickshaw pullers in name, promulgated various ideal new methods, and established a rickshaw affairs committee, implementing various strict plans that would immediately bankrupt the rickshaw industry and plunge the masses who rely on rickshaws for a living into despair. The future is precarious, and we are trembling with fear. Therefore, we respectfully list the unreasonable points in the plan as follows (Four reasons, the text is long and will be recorded separately later.) In summary, the above four points are only the major ones. Other aspects, such as the reduction of rickshaw rentals and the regulations on property rights, are arbitrarily demanded. Their intention is to eliminate the entire rickshaw industry in the Special Zone as soon as possible. In fact, the rickshaw industry in the Special Zone has made significant contributions to the prosperity of the concession in the beginning. Due to the prosperity of the concession and the needs of life, the value has increased, resulting in repeated buying and selling, which is the same as other industries such as real estate. The Public Works Department did not prohibit the sale of vehicles in the past, including the limited notices (vehicles and notices are incidental). Even those who have made huge fortunes by buying and selling real estate at low prices have not been restricted or banned. Only the owners who bought vehicles at high prices in the end are fundamentally banned, their business is eliminated, and their livelihoods are cut off, which is similar to forgetting the fish trap after catching the fish, and more like substituting a plum for a peach, which is extremely unfair. The Association believes that the rickshaw industry in the Special Zone is the result of the hard work of hundreds of thousands of rickshaw operators and pullers for decades. It cannot be destroyed by the conspiracy of a small number of ambitious people. We cannot bear to see the rickshaw operators and pullers suffer unimaginable tragedies because they cannot save themselves. Therefore, we respectfully describe the process and explain the previous situation, hoping that you will examine and verify the facts and negotiate with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to pay attention to the social security and the serious lives of the hundreds of thousands of people in the rickshaw industry, handle it carefully, and maintain the business. This is for the convenience of the business. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Four Reasons</h3>
<p>(1) The Rickshaw Affairs Committee recently issued a notice that from August, rickshaw operators will be required to collect a fee of one dime per vehicle per day from rickshaw pullers for the so-called Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Relief Fund, and rickshaw operators will be required to pay 1.5 yuan per vehicle per month in advance when collecting licenses each month, otherwise, the donation and license collection will be suspended. This disguised additional tax not only violates the regulations of the Yangjingbang Regulations, but also claims to provide relief to rickshaw pullers. How can it turn around and exploit rickshaw pullers to increase their burden? Moreover, how will this huge amount of money be used each year? There has been no precise budget announced so far. (2) The source of rickshaw pullers is mostly from bankrupt rural areas. Therefore, they leave their hometowns and come together, hoping to maintain their livelihoods with hard work. The general rickshaw pullers who live in Shanghai all year round and pull rickshaws as a fixed occupation are actually a minority. The majority are those who come in the spring and leave in the autumn, depending on the harvest in the countryside. If rickshaw puller registration is to be carried out, not only will few rickshaw pullers who lack nutrition be qualified during the physical examination, but also rickshaw pullers come and go in a hurry, and their whereabouts are uncertain, so the registration procedures cannot be implemented. Moreover, rickshaw pulling is a temporary occupation for bankrupt rural areas, not a lifelong career. If registration and photographing are carried out, so that these loyal and good farmers become fixed rickshaw pullers, wouldn't it be restricting their lifelong development and preventing people from having the opportunity to improve themselves? Moreover, even if registration is carried out among the existing rickshaw pullers, taking 40,000 qualified people for registration and issuing certificates, what will happen to the other tens of thousands of unqualified rickshaw pullers? (3) The style of existing vehicles in the Special Zone is all determined by the Vehicle Affairs Department of the工部局. Over the years, rickshaw operators have complied strictly and dared not overstep. Now, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has come up with whimsical ideas, disregarding reality, and ignoring the existing simple and strong styles, and ordered rickshaw operators to follow new, flashy and expensive styles. Not only will the rickshaw operators be at a loss, but the rickshaw operators will also increase their costs several times. Even if they are willing to comply, they are unable to do so and cannot accept this burden. (4) Over the years, the rickshaw operators in the Special Zone have been under the management and leadership of the Vehicle Affairs Department and Donation Department of the工部局. Orders have been carried out immediately and have never been resisted. Rickshaw operators have sincerely supported all plans and facilities of the competent authorities. Now, the工部局 has established a Rickshaw Affairs Committee in addition to the original agencies. The agencies are parallel and the political orders are divergent. If it is not intended to destroy the rickshaw industry, why would this be done?</p>
<h3>Association's Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the Special Zone Office of the Rickshaw Industry Association, who spoke to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, this morning (that is, yesterday morning), representatives of the rickshaw operators petitioned the Party and government agencies and the Taxpaying Chinese Association of the British and French Concessions. The results were good, which shows that all sectors attach great importance to this incident. However, this serious problem has been brewing for a long time, and it is regrettable that the authorities are being evasive and there is no real understanding of the situation. Although the authorities have not taken any obvious actions in recent days, their position on destroying the rickshaw operators who have been law-abiding for decades has not changed slightly. Now, the Vehicle Affairs Committee has extended the license collection period to the 13th of this month and postponed the implementation of the new regulations to that day. However, our rickshaw operators believe that the interests are so disparate that it is enough to make it impossible for our industry to survive. If the regulations are not properly amended, it will be difficult to comply. The rickshaw operators have proposed a compromise to take care of both sides without worry. (1) Reduce rickshaw rentals. The Vehicle Affairs Committee stipulates that the daily rickshaw rental should be 10 cents this year. Rickshaw operators originally charged 14 cents. Now, it is decided to charge 12 cents per day and pay 1 yuan per month per vehicle for mutual aid fees. (2) Reform the vehicle style. The Association will build several new styles and ask the authorities to adopt them. (3) Rickshaw puller registration. This point is difficult to do. However, the authorities still insist on the original proposal and ignore it. Our rickshaw operators in the Special Zone have a long history. The authorities collect donations and comply with the regulations. However, suddenly making major changes now is definitely not as easy as it seems in fact. At the same time, vehicles in the Special Zone have already collected the Chinese and French notices and donations. Only the Public Concession authorities have disputes due to the new regulations. If the situation becomes serious in the future and causes unfortunate events, who will be responsible?</p>
<h3>Vehicle Affairs Committee's Attitude</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xin Xin News Agency reporter went to the Rickshaw Management Committee of the Public Works Department to inquire about everything. According to the person in charge of the Committee, the biggest purpose of the工部局 in establishing the Rickshaw Management Committee is to fully comply with the public opinion of the society and improve the lives of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers. The inside story of the rickshaw industry in the Public Concession is indescribable. As for the several objections raised by the rickshaw operators, we hereby explain as follows: (1) As for the opposition to rickshaw puller registration and obtaining licenses, although the rickshaw operators have their reasons, their intention is nothing more than to create a shortage of vehicle distribution and increase rickshaw rentals to make profits. (2) The purpose of the donation for the Rickshaw Puller Mutual Aid Association advocated by the Committee is actually to seek the interests of the rickshaw pullers themselves. In addition, the Committee will first hand over the donation to the bank for safekeeping, and then hire charitable organizations to handle it. The Rickshaw operators resolutely oppose it. What is their intention? It should be clear. As for the Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee, it is an executive agency, and its responsibility is only to execute. If you want to change the established principles, the Management Committee does not have this authority. If an unfortunate event occurs as a result, the工部局 has its own appropriate handling methods.</p>

<p>Shanghai County Autonomous Region has been divided into five districts, and the townships and towns in each district have also been divided into six towns and thirty-six townships. In addition to the re-election of the district heads, the township and town heads and deputies are appointed by the County Magistrate. Each township and town has one head and two deputies. Minhang Town has increased a deputy town head due to the complexity of its affairs. The reorganization and merger of districts, townships, and towns this time is related to the future promotion of autonomy, and the local people attach great importance to it.

<h3>Provisional Measures for Refund of Passenger Tickets on Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways issued a circular stating that, in addition to fully unused tickets, which may be handled at the issuing station on the same day as usual, all other ticket refunds must be handled directly by the Traffic Department. In order to facilitate passengers, seven provisional measures for ticket refunds are stipulated and published separately. These measures will be implemented from August 1 this year. In addition to printing and distributing "Ticket Refund Application Forms" for use by various stations and business offices, all related stations should be ordered to strictly comply with these measures and handle them carefully. The measures are as follows: (1) All stations and business offices must strictly verify ticket prices in accordance with the provisions of Articles 48 to 55 of Section 6 of Chapter 2 of the Passenger Car Transportation Regulations. (2) All types of passenger tickets and special circumstances listed below shall be handled directly by the Traffic Department as usual. (A) All types of passenger tickets sold by China Travel Service, Thomas Cook &amp; Son, and American Express Bank, etc. (B) All types of domestic intermodal passenger tickets and water-land intermodal passenger tickets (except those specified in Article 6). (C) Employee preferential tickets. (D) Group discount tickets (except those stipulated in Article 40, Section 3, Chapter 2 of the Passenger Transportation Regulations, Item (G), no refunds are allowed). (E) Periodic train tickets (except those stipulated in Article 9 of Annex 1 of the Passenger Transportation Regulations, no refunds are allowed). (F) In the event of crowded seats or downgraded travel. (G) In the event of any doubt about passenger tickets. (H) In the event that a passenger requests a refund due to special circumstances, or the refund procedures are incomplete, or the stations and business offices cannot resolve the matter, or the reason for the refund needs detailed investigation. (3) Passengers requesting a refund should hold the ticket and ask the relevant station master to endorse it as unused within the validity period of the passenger ticket (if the passenger ticket is completely unused, they should ask the station master of the departure station to endorse it; if the journey is stopped midway, they should ask the station master of the station where the journey is stopped to endorse it). Once the station master has endorsed it, they should immediately instruct the passenger to ask the ticket office to refund the ticket price. (4) Regardless of whether it is a one-way passenger ticket or the unused portion of a round-trip ticket, after being endorsed by the relevant station master, the passenger can ask for a refund at the departure station or the station where the journey is stopped (for example, if a passenger holds a round-trip ticket from Shanghai North to Nanjing for sightseeing, and stops the journey in Nanjing, the unused portion can be refunded at Nanjing Station or Shanghai North Station). Tickets sold by business offices can also be refunded at the station according to the above example, and tickets sold by the station can also be refunded at the business office, whichever is convenient for the passenger. (5) When verifying and refunding ticket prices, each station and business office should first verify whether the station master's endorsement is correct, and then instruct the passenger to fill out two copies of the "Ticket Refund Application Form," with the duplicate used as a file copy, and the original should be sent to the accounting office for verification and cancellation together with the refunded ticket and the cash remittance slip for that day, as proof of the ticket price refund, for easy reference. (6) If various domestic intermodal and water-land intermodal passenger tickets sold by each station and business office are completely unused, passengers may hold the ticket on the same day and ask the station master of the respective departure station to endorse it, and then fill out the "Ticket Refund Application Form" to refund the ticket price at the respective station's ticket office or business office in accordance with the regulations. If it is not completely unused, and a refund is requested on the same day, it must still be handled by the Traffic Department in accordance with Article 2, Item B. (7) If a passenger requests a refund and the stations cannot directly handle the refund according to the regulations in this method, they should kindly inform the passenger to contact the Traffic Department directly for handling, or the stations should forward it to the Traffic Department for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Revises Passenger Safety Guarantee Measures</h3>
<p>Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Notifies Shipping Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday stating that the three passenger safety guarantee measures, which were promulgated by the Ministry on April 23, have now been approved by the Ministry of Finance to request amendments to Measures 2 and 3. After careful consideration, the revisions are as follows: Article 2: Passenger ships passing through each customs house shall present the ship inspection certificate and passenger quota certificate for verification. If there is no above-mentioned certificate, or it is found that the number of passengers exceeds the quota, the customs house may impose penalties in accordance with the regulations, but the maritime affairs bureau in charge shall be notified of the penalty situation in writing afterwards. Article 3: If the previous ship encounters military forces forcibly boarding during departure or navigation, resulting in exceeding the quota, the captain or ship management personnel shall refuse. If there is no way to resist due to secret force, the maritime affairs authority and the customs house at the location or the first port of passage shall be notified immediately for disposal. Article 1 of the measures has not been amended. The original text reads, "In the future, when each maritime affairs bureau issues passenger quota certificates, it should consider the ship's hull, machinery, boiler construction, and other capabilities, and approve the quota within the minimum limit. If the life-saving equipment is lacking, the inspection certificate may be suspended." The bureau has forwarded the order to all offices, the municipal shipping industry association, and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for information.</p>
<h3>Serious Drought in Gaoqiao District Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Continues Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Already Requested the浚浦局 (Dredging Bureau) to Increase Water Pumping Time</p>
<p>After the city's drought relief work began, the浚浦局 was requested to build dams and pump water at Qianjia浜 in Yinhang District, Puxi, and at Jiangxin River in Gaoqiao District, Pudong. After intermittent rains, the Municipal Government has notified the suspension of the work. However, the Gaoqiao area continues to do so. The dam has been built, and the dredger near the Guanghua Oil Pond is used to pump water for two to three hours a day during the spare time of filling mud, irrigating the Lao Huangpu River and injecting it into the branch rivers. Due to the large-scale dam construction project, it takes ten days. At the time when the river tide is high, although three huge iron pipes are buried in the dam and can be opened and closed automatically, they still cannot be unblocked. Usually, the river water can flood the paddy fields, and there is no need to use manual water pumping for irrigation. At this time, when the rice is about to spit ears, the need for water is urgent. If the built dam is demolished to wait for the tide to advance, the great flood has passed and it will take nearly ten days to wait for the next time, which will inevitably cause the rice fields to wither and affect the autumn harvest. Therefore, the farmers in the district are extremely anxious. The Gaoqiao District Farmers Association dispatched representatives Yang Buqing and Chen Dong to report to the Municipal Farmers Association, requesting assistance and relief. The association's executive director Yu Zhenhui contacted Wu Huanru, the second section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Tian Heqing, the director of the inspection section, overnight. Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Tian Heqing and Yu Zhenhui to inspect. The local farmers flocked to ask the浚浦局 to pump water day and night to benefit the farmers. Tian and Yu believed that the situation was urgent and rushed to the Social Affairs Bureau to report. The bureau was very concerned and believed that it was necessary to provide immediate relief. It still sent personnel to the工務局 (Public Works Bureau) to meet with Dr. Xia, the chief engineer of the浚浦局. Dr. Xia also believed that the lack of water in the district would affect agricultural production, and it was necessary to increase the water pumping time. He immediately telegraphed the person in charge of the district to process water overnight, and promised to find ways to add night work to benefit the farmers. This time, the浚浦局 was very enthusiastic about the drought relief work. It was also heard that the Social Affairs Bureau intends to move the water pumping machine previously allocated to the district from the East China Sea beach to the place to increase the water volume.</p>
<h3>Haiyan Sojourners in Shanghai Telegraph Zhejiang Provincial Government to Prevent Drought and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Haiyan Sojourners in Shanghai telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities, Hangzhou Chairman Lu, Director Lü, and Director Wang, Jingjian: Our county has been suffering from severe drought since the beginning of summer. It has not rained for a long time. The fields are cracked and it is difficult to plant rice seedlings. The disaster area is vast. Only in the past, farmers from all over the county reported famine, and there are hundreds of people every day. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the people are struggling to survive. You should send personnel to investigate the disaster and provide effective assistance as soon as possible, and exempt丁漕 (poll tax and grain tax) to relieve the people's distress and save the people from disaster. We urgently request instructions. The Haiyan Sojourners in Shanghai, Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Yaoting, Zhang Tongsheng, Zhu Zhitian, Zhou Xinbo, Chen Hongxun, Zhou Rongsun, Jin Fubao, Xu Wenzhan, Yu Yizhang, Wu Linkun, Li Zhuoqun, Chen Jiongwen, Zhang Zhemin, Zhu Jianqiu, Jiang Tongfu, Wang Shangzhong, and Wang Shenfu, respectfully kowtow, Shiyin, Post and Savings Bureau, Xu Boyuan, Talks with Representatives of the Postal and Trade Associations, Explains Contract Content,</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications signed a contract for the agency to collect and pay 款项 (funds), which has aroused widespread attention. The Postal Workers' Associations are particularly concerned. They once telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to request correction. Recently, Mr. Xu Boyuan, Deputy Director of the Remittance Bureau in Shanghai, made a statement denying the overdraft of 款项. His wording seemed to involve contempt for postal workers. In order to clarify the truth, the Postal and Trade Associations in Shanghai specially dispatched representatives Huang Gongfu, Cheng Zuoqing, and Lu Keming to the Remittance Bureau yesterday to request an explanation. Deputy Director Xu Boyuan received them, briefly explained the contract, and apologized for the report published a few days ago. The news reporters made inaccurate statements and the words were inappropriate. He hoped that the Postal and Trade Associations would not misunderstand.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to工部局</h3>
<p>Please Do Not Add Travel Industry Patrol Donation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the request of the Travel Industry Association, wrote to the Public Works Department yesterday, requesting the cancellation of the proposal to price rooms as a basis for taxation. The original letter stated, "We are writing to you to inform you that according to a letter from the Travel Industry Association on the first of this month, the Oriental, Jue Lu, and Da Zhonghua hotels reported that the Public Works Department recently sent personnel to investigate room prices, re-evaluate the total value of the houses, and increase the Patrol Donation by one-third to one-half from October 1 (the full text has been recorded in the July 30 issue of this newspaper, excerpted). We specially request the Public Works Department to uphold justice and provide strong assistance, and seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department to withdraw the order, so as to maintain the dying travel industry. At this time, when the market is depressed and trade in all industries is declining, all taxes of your bureau should only maintain the original method and should not be increased extra. This is the common wish of the general public and the principle that your bureau should abide by in handling affairs. Recently, the number of rooms in the hotel industry and the huge amount of compensation are facts known to all. Your bureau ignores these facts and creates a unique style, proposing to investigate the business price of its rooms as a taxation standard. This method has never been used before, and it is even closer to harsh taxation when applied to the industry's declining trade today, which is by no means what the industry can afford. In the past, whenever your bureau had increased donations and changed methods, once they were discussed and implemented, no matter how the industries requested, your bureau insisted on its established opinions and rarely made changes. As a result, businessmen were quite disappointed. Our association is in a position to represent businessmen and negotiate with your bureau, and it is even more criticized by businessmen. This time, the investigation of the business price of hotel rooms is still in the preparation stage and has not been implemented. Your bureau should adopt a sincere attitude and accommodate the opinions of the businessmen. In order to promote Chinese-foreign relations, our association speaks frankly for your bureau, hoping to understand and cancel the act of changing the hotel industry's tax collection method. This is the most anticipated." This is addressed to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 750 Students</p>
<p>The Improved Chinese Bookkeeping Training Course jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commercial School and Xu Yongzuo Accountant's Accounting School was held at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 7:40 a.m. yesterday. Yan Esheng, Principal of the Commercial School, and Xu Yongzuo, Accountant and Principal of the Accounting School, led the lecturers of the training course Pan Shihao, Xu Hanqing, Lu Shanzhi, Zhang Hongjun, and many instructors to preside over the ceremony. More than 750 students attended. The two principals, Yan and Xu, both gave speeches, with profound explanations of the true meaning of improved Chinese bookkeeping. Mr. Xu also reported on the course's progress. At 8:40 a.m., the ceremony was completed, photos were taken, and everyone dispersed. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony Order</h3>
<p>(1) All stand at attention and pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Principal Yan respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. All stand up and salute the principals, lecturers, and instructors. (2) Principal Xu reported on the course's progress. (3) Principal Yan gave a speech. (4) Principal Xu gave a speech. (5) Principal Xu announced the methods for entering the venue to listen to lectures and practice. (6) Photography.</p>
<h3>Progress Report</h3>
<p>After Yan Esheng gave a speech, Principal Xu Yongzuo reported that since Western bookkeeping was introduced to China, Chinese bookkeeping has been despised. However, for the past thirty or forty years, except for banks, railways, and large enterprises, the prevalence of Chinese bookkeeping has remained the same, and its simplicity and incompleteness have also remained the same. Remaining in this state for a long time has a huge impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Although I learned Western bookkeeping, in the past ten years, I have felt that Western bookkeeping is not easy to promote, and Chinese bookkeeping is difficult to abandon. I advocate guiding the situation and improving Chinese bookkeeping. Since I announced the plan for improving Chinese bookkeeping and published a special book last winter, it has attracted the attention of people across the country. At that time, an exhibition and lecture were held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and 10,000 people participated. The grand occasion was unprecedented. At that time, many audience members had requested to open a training course, but it was not possible due to busy work. Since this year, more and more people have adopted improved Chinese bookkeeping, and more and more people have requested to open a training course. Therefore, I agreed on a brief outline with Mr. Yan, the Principal of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commercial School, and opened the course. The only purpose of opening the course is to cultivate talents for improved Chinese bookkeeping, so the qualification restrictions are very broad. Whether they are from the business community or the academic community, whether they have learned bookkeeping or not, university students and primary and secondary school students can enroll. The fees charged are also very low, so it is expected to be popularized. Since the enrollment advertisement was published, it has exceeded 700 people in less than ten days. Limited to the classroom, we had to close the application in advance, so those who arrived later were inevitably disappointed. In the future, we will probably open a second class. The students who are currently enrolled have different occupations and different levels. During the lectures, we will take into account both theory and rules, so that those with high levels can delve into the theory and promote it, and those with low levels can pay attention to accounting techniques and become proficient in application.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Wharf Business Office Actively Handles General Registration</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Wharf Business Office began to conduct a general registration of dockworkers throughout the city on June 1, its work has been very busy. In order to facilitate the registration of trade unions, the office specially sent registration staff to various docks to organize temporary registration offices. The office originally planned to complete the registration of the South City docks by the end of July. However, due to the large number of workers, it was unable to complete the task as scheduled. It is now actively proceeding, and it is expected that the registration of the docks in the South District will be completed soon. In addition, in order to facilitate the work when conducting the registration, the office specially requested the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government to issue a notice to all dock foremen, ordering their subordinates, such as挡手 (foremen) and 拆賬頭 (account splitters) workers, to register in accordance with the office's registration regulations. The Municipal Party Committee published a notice in various newspapers in mid-June. The Municipal Government has also issued Notice No. 162, which has been delivered to the office for posting at various docks. From now on, the office's registration work will proceed more smoothly.</p>
<h3>Dong Hongjun Scheduled to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Negotiate Overseas Chinese Investment Matters</p>
<p>The failure of domestic industry and commerce in recent years has aroused the attention of overseas Chinese, who are willing to invest in their motherland. However, sometimes due to lack of contact, their patriotic hearts cannot be fully expressed. It is learned that Dong Hongjun, the owner of China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory, plans to purchase 400 mu of land in Lüjiahang, Jiangwan. 100 mu of which will be used by Mr. Dong privately to expand the factory base, and the remaining 300 mu will be used to build a model village for overseas Chinese to live in when they return. Overseas Chinese, because Mr. Dong is enthusiastic about overseas Chinese affairs, heard that Mr. Dong will set sail on the 4th of this month, first to Xiamen, and then to the Nebula.</p>
<h3>Song and Dance Troupe Reorganization Renaming Dispute</h3>
<p>After Mediation, the Case Will Be Withdrawn</p>
<p>Wei Yingbo, Zhang Weitao, Tang Juxin, Huang Hun, Zhu Renbai, etc., jointly organized the Liwa Song and Dance Troupe on March 3, 1931, with a total of four shares, each share costing 500 yuan, totaling 2,000 yuan. Huang Hun and Zhu Renbai each contributed 250 yuan, combining to form one share. At that time, the troupe performed abroad, but it was not well received. Therefore, it suffered huge losses. Wei, etc., reorganized again, changing the troupe's name to Lianhua. Later, because it was not optimistic by others, it was renamed Meihua Song and Dance Troupe and went to perform in the Nanyang Islands. It was well received by the local people. The troupe was able to return fully loaded. Recently, it performed at the Xin Guang Cinema in this city. Zhu Renbai, (living at No. 10 Chongde Lane, Minguo Road, Xiaobeimen, French Concession) believes that the Meihua Song and Dance Troupe is the same as the original Liwa Song and Dance Troupe personnel. Although the troupe's name has been changed, the profits should be divided equally. Huang Li did not respond to this, so Zhu specially extended lawyer Chen Chou to file a special criminal lawsuit with the Second District Court, accusing Huang Hun of committing fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. The court approved the motion, and the defendant Huang Hun (living at No. 9 Anyi Lane, Rue Pére Froc) was summoned yesterday. Lawyer Pan Renxi appeared in court to defend him, believing that all the capital of the song and dance troupe that was jointly formed at that time was completely lost. Fortunately, before the case was heard, Wei Yingbo came to the scene to mediate between the two parties. After the two parties understood each other and voluntarily resolved the matter peacefully, the two lawyers applied to withdraw the lawsuit after the court session. Judge Zhang Chaozuo verified the words and ruled in court that the case would not be accepted. The courtroom case was peacefully resolved.</p>
<h3>Ding Youmin Committed Suicide Out of Homesickness</h3>
<p>Mentally Disturbed After Entering the习勤所 (Work Training Center)</p>
<p>Cut His Throat with a Paper Cutter</p>
<p>Wan Tong Ding Youmin, (a 16-year-old from Hangzhou) lost his parents at a young age, lacked uncles and aunts, and had few brothers. Alone, he wandered to Shanghai. Forced by the environment, he associated with unscrupulous people, and inevitably had irregular behaviors. The police arrested Ding and sent him to the Caohejing Itinerant Work Training Center to learn a trade. He was assigned to work in the typesetting room. He usually wrote in the air, seemingly mentally ill. The center had treated him, and he gradually recovered. However, when chatting with his companions, he often said that only parents are the most beloved in the world,</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st) The Beijing Amateur Athletic Federation, in order to promote sports and enhance the international status of sports, has invited world tennis titans Tilden, the world-recognized number one tennis player Vines, and French star Cochet, among others, to come to China for performances.

Qiu Feihai, a renowned tennis player from Shanghai, has handled the preparation and everything is in order. Vines and others have agreed to come to China for performances in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. The Amateur Athletic Federation believes this performance is of great significance to the international standing of our sports community.

<p>Austin Defeats Wood, England Wins 4-1 Against the United States / Davis Cup Deciding Match Results / All Four American Singles Players Defeated</p>
<p>(Havas Agency, London, 31st) In the Davis Cup deciding match between England and the United States, on the final day, both singles matches were won by England. The match details are provided below:</p>
<p>Henman vs. Sears / In the first singles match between Henman (England) and Sears (USA), before the match, most people expected Henman to win. Some were even willing to bet two to one against those who predicted a Sears victory. Judging from the process, Sears' fighting spirit was truly amazing. Even in the 28th game of the fourth set, Sears persisted without yielding, and the final outcome was still uncertain at that time. As for Henman's strategy, it was excellent. Once he gained an advantage, he would position himself on the baseline, preventing Sears from coming to the net to display his interception skills, which was the reason for his victory. The weather was extremely hot and stuffy at the start of the match. Henman won three consecutive games, but Sears rallied to tie the score at 3-3. The audience appreciated the skill of the players and often cheered loudly, forcing the referee to intervene and demand order. In the seventh game, Henman repeatedly attacked the opponent's backhand, gaining a 4-3 lead. Sears then tied the score again at 4-4. In the following two games, Henman repeatedly went to the net to win with pressure shots, eventually winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, Sears clearly controlled the momentum, taking a 4-3 lead first, then 5-3. Although Henman tried hard to win back a game, Sears ultimately won the second set 6-4. In the third set, Sears adopted a defensive posture, but was eventually defeated by Henman. The fourth set started with a 1-1 tie. Henman then won two consecutive games to lead 3-1. Sears then pulled back two games to tie the score. Henman then won the seventh game with a swift forehand shot, leading 4-3. Sears won back another game to tie the score at 4-4. At this point, both sides were extremely cautious, not daring to make mistakes. Although Henman exhausted his strategies, changing his attack patterns, Sears also tried hard to resist. Both sides won another game each, tying at 5-5, then 6-6, and then 7-7. Sears once led 8-7, but Henman won two consecutive games to lead 9-8. Sears then tied the score at 9-9. Henman then led again at 10-9. By this time, both sides were showing signs of fatigue, but Sears still fought valiantly, taking the lead again at 11-10. Unfortunately, he made several mistakes, allowing Henman to tie the score again at 11-11. By the 28th game, the score was 14-13. Henman's unpredictable skills broke through the opponent's defense, and he won the final set with a score of 15-13. The match lasted a total of two hours and twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Austin Defeats Wood / In the last match, Wood (USA) played against Austin (England). Both sides, knowing that the outcome had already been decided, played without much excitement. Wood seemed to be practicing rather than competing. Austin also finished the match hastily. As a result, Austin won with scores of 6-4, 6-0, 6-8, and 6-3.</p>
<p>Davis Cup Deciding Match Results / Austin (England) (6-4, 6-4, 6-1) Sears (USA) / Henman (England) (6-1, 4-6, 5-7, 6-0, 6-3) Wood (USA) / Locke Stowe Fehn (USA) (7-5, 6-0, 4-6, 9-7) Hughes Lee (England) / Henman (England) (8-4, 4-6, 6-2, 15-13) Sears (USA) / Austin (England) (6-4, 6-0, 6-8, 6-3) Full Special</p>

Although Hou suffered a "duck egg" in the first set, the scores in each game were quite close. Hou's spirit was better in the second set. After setbacks in the first and third games, he managed to tie the score in the second and fourth games. Unfortunately, his momentum waned later, and he was eventually defeated by Zhang.</p>
<p>Bao Genbao and Sun Zhaoxiong in the body category both forfeited twice and were disqualified from the competition. Anyone scheduled to play against them in that category in the future does not need to attend.</p>

<p>Tennis New Techniques (13)</p>
<p>Original by J. PARMLY PARFT / Translated by Qian Yi, Qin, Hong Jun</p>

<p>The movements of the topspin and slice shots are completely different. The preparation for the slice shot, which is a downward stroke, starts higher. The racket meets the ball at about the horizontal line. The ball rolls across the strings, creating backspin. Therefore, the racket is below the ball, the wrist twists, and the racket sweeps downward, causing the ball to spin backward and fly forward.</p>
<p>In any case, after hitting the ball, the racket must be swung below the hitting position. The racket head is not above the ball but below it. Therefore, the swing of the racket is shorter than any other hitting method, and the follow-through is less. Usually, players using this method only swing the racket head to the front of the left knee before stopping the motion, and the arm is fully extended. It is not like the topspin shot, where the follow-through is maximized, and the racket goes all the way around the head. Therefore, the backward swing of the racket before hitting the ball should be shorter, so the player can have more time to aim at the opponent and sometimes fool the opponent, making it impossible for them to determine where they will be attacked. This is the benefit of this method. As for hitting the ball towards the sideline, there is room for the ball to fly as far as possible while still landing within the boundary. At this time, using the slice shot is beneficial. However, when shooting diagonally at the opponent, the sideline of the court will limit the ball's flight path, so it is not suitable to use this hitting method.</p>
<p>If the opponent is standing at the net waiting to volley the incoming ball, the player using the slice shot to shoot the ball diagonally is simply committing suicide. However, shooting straight along the sideline is often effective.</p>
<p>As for the two methods mentioned above, each has considerable benefits, which is undoubtedly the case. Among skilled players, apart from Tilden and a few other masters, very few are good at using this slice shot. In any case, it is difficult to master both methods at the same time. It is better to use only one. Therefore, very few players who have learned and applied both of Tilden's methods have succeeded. Only Tilden himself can achieve great success with both methods at the same time.</p>
<p>When players can choose the hitting method, about nine out of ten will choose the topspin shot. Even Tilden, who is good at using the slice shot, often advises people, "The foundation of tennis is the topspin shot, and the slice shot is just an accessory. So, when beginners choose only one method, they should definitely choose the topspin shot."</p>
<p>There is another method for the forehand shot, which is commonly called the "flat shot." This method relies entirely on the flat swing of the racket to sweep the ball without spin.</p>
<p>Logically, this method seems to be the best because the full power of the hit is directly behind the incoming ball, which should produce an effective hit. However, in practical application, if the swing of the racket is slightly accelerated, the forward force of the ball will be too great, causing it to go out of bounds. Therefore, it is still necessary to have some spin on the ball to ensure it lands within the boundary.</p>
<p>Very few players can succeed with the flat shot without reducing the speed of the hit. Since the ball's flight path is shorter, the speed of the hit should not be increased. At this time, the swing of the racket must be moderate, so the player has great control over the direction and cannot use as much follow-through as with the topspin shot, or quickly pull the ball forward.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when swinging the racket backward in preparation, do not swing too high or too far back. It must be at the same horizontal line as the position where the racket contacts the ball when hitting. After hitting the ball, the forward swing of the racket should only follow the flat swing. It is best for beginners to practice this flat shot first. After they have mastered this style, they can change their technique slightly to use the two types of topspin hitting mentioned above. When practicing the topspin shot, simply drag the racket slightly upward when hitting the ball, so the ball rolls across the racket and sweeps forward. As a result, the racket swings upward after the ball is hit instead of being horizontal to the hitting position. At this time, the shooting power and speed will immediately increase, and the degree of spin on the ball can be adjusted appropriately according to different situations.</p>
<p>In short, the racket must never droop when hitting the ball, and the racket head must be horizontal to the wrist. Whether it is a flat shot, a topspin shot, or a slice shot, the racket must always swing flat for the hit to be effective. If beginners remember this principle first, and then change the angle of the racket's back and forth swing, they will quickly learn the benefits of various hits. Whether it is the forward-spinning topspin shot or the backward-spinning slice shot, they will be able to apply them as desired.</p>

<p>Pacific Student Conference: Our Country Opposes Japan's Proposal to Include the Puppet Manchukuo</p>
<p>Tension in Discussions Between China and Japan on the Northeast Issue</p>
<p>The Pacific Student Conference, initiated by the World Student Christian Federation of the United States, opened yesterday at the auditorium of Shanghai University in Yangshupu. Seventeen representatives from our country attended, and representatives from Australia, New Zealand, and other countries are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today to participate. The purpose of the conference is to promote social interaction among international youth students and exchange knowledge. The conference program includes discussions, speeches, field trips, and entertainment. The first meeting yesterday was a roundtable discussion on the Northeast issue. Chinese and Japanese representatives debated with each other, and the atmosphere was quite tense. The Japanese representative, Matsumura, suddenly proposed a motion to include representatives of puppet students in the conference, replaying the old trick of the Japanese disrupting the Far Eastern Games. The Chinese representatives sternly refuted the Japanese proposal, but the Japanese representatives remained unyielding. Seeing the opportunity, the American representative proposed that the Korean representative participate in the conference. The Japanese representative, at a loss for words, was silent. The issue of the puppet representative's participation will be discussed and decided in the 300-member Preparatory Committee. The conference will last until the 4th.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency interviewed Mr. Liu Zhanen, the chairman of the conference, yesterday. According to his account, the conference first discussed the puppet Manchukuo issue, reporting to the students from various countries on the events of the Northeast Incident. Finally, the Japanese students expressed their opinions, making absurd propaganda in public. Our side refuted them for the last time, resulting in no conclusion. The next topic of discussion will be the Youth and Politics Conference, with Shen Tilan of Merlin High School speaking on the Chinese Youth Movement. The conference will close on the 4th. After the conference, the students from various countries plan to visit Nanjing, North China, and other places.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Orders High School Students to Comply with Summer Military Training Certificates</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 1st) The Ministry of Education, regarding the summer military training for military education in high schools and above, after consulting with the Training Headquarters this year and issuing the training methods, schools in various provinces and cities have already been preparing to implement them. However, among the students in various schools, there are indeed those who, for various reasons or excuses, evade participating in this summer military training, which is inevitable. In order to distinguish and assess students who have complied with summer training, it seems that the organs in charge of summer military training in various places should issue certificates to encourage them. The Ministry has now formulated the certificate for concentrated summer training of students and the method for attaching the certificate, and has instructed the departments and bureaus in various places to announce and implement them, and for private high schools and above to comply.</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China: Members Scheduled to Go to Jiangxi</p>
<p>More Than 100 Members from Various Provinces and Cities Have Registered / The Lecture Committee Has Hired Lecturers for Each Group</p>
<p>The 19th annual meeting of the Science Society of China has been scheduled to be held at the Lian Gu YMCA in Guling, Nanchang, for six days starting August 21st. During the conference, the Chinese Botanical Society, the Geographical Society, the Zoological Society, and other three groups will jointly hold annual meetings. News about this has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that more than 100 members from Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fuzhou, Anhui, Jiangxi, Qingdao, and other provinces and cities have registered. Currently, members from Shanghai, including Wu Liande, Hu Gangfu, and Yang Yunzhong, and members from Nanjing, including Bing Nongshan and Zhu Kezhen, are scheduled to take a boat to Jiangxi on the 16th and 17th. As for the Lecture Committee organized by the annual meeting, after Hu Xian, He Lu, Yan Jici, Yang Shaozeng, Wu Xianshi, Qin Renchang, Hu Boyuan, Chen Qinghua, Zhang Yanxiang, and others were recommended as members, they have been working very hard. The lecturers for the two groups on middle school science education and scientific construction have been hired successively, with a total of more than 20 people, including Bing Nongshan and others. Most of the lectures will be held in the provincial capital of Nanchang. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff of Colleges and Universities in Beiping and Tianjin Petition the Ministry of Education for Back Pay</p>
<p>July Funds Have Arrived in Beiping / (Special Dispatch from Beiping) The 360,000 yuan for the July expenses of colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin arrived in Beiping yesterday. All colleges and universities have collected them separately today (the 28th). However, the uniform accounting system of the Auditing Department has caused problems in the salary payment of colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin. The petition to the Ministry of Education from the four national colleges and universities requesting the clearing of arrears was sent out today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Colleges and Universities Collect Funds / After the education funds for Beiping and Tianjin arrived in Beiping, Jiang Menglin (acting for Zheng Tianting), Yang Likui, accountant Lu Xiaozhi, Yuan Zhengui, and other standing members of the Education Funds Protection Committee went to the committee's office in the East Fourth Hall of the Sino-Western Huai Ren Hall at 10 a.m. today to handle the fund collection procedures. After completion, accountant Lu Xiaozhi went to the Central Bank to collect the funds and notified all colleges and universities to go to the Continental Bank to collect the funds at 11 a.m. After receiving the notification, the colleges and universities often sent accounting staff with the receipts for the current month to the Continental Bank to collect the funds. The funds will be distributed to the faculty and staff next Monday.</p>
<p>Salary Payment Method / The Ministry of Education has ordered the four national colleges and universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Normal University, and the Beiping Research Institute, to uniformly implement the accounting system starting in July, filling out the payment report for the current month and not reissuing arrears. Currently, the faculty and staff of the colleges and universities are seeking arrears from the central government and have decided on two salary payment methods for adoption by the colleges and universities. The authorities of the colleges and universities have held talks to discuss the results and decided to petition the Ministry of Education to find a way to clear the arrears. The salary payment method before the arrears are cleared is a matter of urgency and has been discussed separately. (1) The salary payment method for Normal University is that the faculty and staff fill out the receipts for salary, temporarily leaving the month blank, only indicating the amount of salary received. (2) The salary payment method for Peking University is that the faculty and staff in Beiping fill out the receipts for salary, temporarily leaving the month blank, and those who have left the job will not be paid. (3) The salary payment method for Peking University is that the faculty and staff fill out the receipts for salary, which is freely filled out by the faculty and staff. Those who wish to fill out the current month can fill out the current month, and those who do not wish to fill out the current month can still fill out the receipts according to the method of paying arrears. The petition is submitted to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The authorities of the four national colleges and universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Normal University, and the Beiping Research Institute, believe that the Ministry of Education previously ordered all schools to implement a uniform accounting system and not to reissue arrears after 1928. At the same time, it also ordered all schools to find ways to repay the arrears to foreign merchants and foreign professors before 1928 and before 1934. This matter seems to be unfairly treated. Therefore, a joint meeting was convened a few days ago and it was decided to petition the Ministry of Education to clear the arrears of domestic faculty and staff and all commercial arrears before 1934 according to the method of repaying the arrears of foreign teachers and foreign merchants. The petition was drafted by Peking University and has been submitted today after being revised by the three schools of Peking University, Normal University, and the Beiping Research Institute. The main idea of the original text is that the uniform accounting system has been implemented in accordance with the order, but the arrears of faculty and staff and all commercial arrears of the colleges and universities before 1934 should still be handled in accordance with the method of repaying the arrears of foreign teachers and foreign merchants.</p>
<p>Arrears Problem / According to Yang Likui, a representative of the United Association of Faculty and Staff of Colleges and Universities in Beiping and Tianjin, regarding the matter of the United Association of Faculty and Staff of Colleges and Universities in Beiping and Tianjin seeking the issuance of arrears from the central government, it has been decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition. The candidates for representatives have been determined (temporarily not announced). The date of going south is still to be discussed at a meeting. The date of the meeting will be decided after the salaries of the colleges and universities for this month are issued. As for the method of filling out the receipts for salary payment for faculty and staff of the colleges and universities this month, the association has notified separately according to the resolution of the general meeting: (1) Those without arrears should fill out the receipts for July. (2) Those with arrears should still fill out the receipts according to the usual method of collecting funds and should not fill out the receipts for July. The colleges and universities, due to the order of the Auditing Department that the receipts for the current month must be obtained, the staff and workers are determined to refuse to collect salaries collectively in order to strive thoroughly. In addition, the association's efforts to seek arrears this time are due to the great inequality in the treatment received by the staff and workers. The arrears of foreign teachers and foreign merchants in colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin have been ordered by the Ministry of Education to be cleared, while there is no repayment method for the arrears of domestic teachers. Therefore, the association is determined to strive to the end and will not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education Strictly Orders Schools to Report Student Registration Documents</p>
<p>Should Comply with the Prescribed Procedures and Time Limit for Handling / Schools Will Not Be Supplemented After the Deadline and Will Be Shut Down</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order to secondary schools yesterday, stating that the registration documents of new students and transfer students admitted by each school every semester should be sent directly to the bureau for review, or sent to other places for investigation, and should be completed in accordance with the prescribed time limit in order to clear the procedures. This has been repeatedly ordered in the past, but it has been found that many schools can strictly abide by the regulations and handle them conscientiously, while many schools do not comply with the time limit and delay arbitrarily. Often, only part of the documents that should be sent directly to the bureau for review are reported by the deadline, or all of them are not reported after the deadline. Even after a deadline is set for supplementing the report, they turn a deaf ear. As for the registration documents of transfer students that should be sent to other places for investigation, since the investigation procedures are handled directly by the schools, there are more arbitrary delays in issuing the investigation. By the time of graduation, the student's registration has not yet been filed, resulting in temporary scrambling, regardless of whether the procedures comply with the regulations or whether the documents are consistent, and asking for a lenient supplement with fabricated words. This not only creates many difficulties in administrative procedures, but also breeds various malpractices and affects students' studies to a small extent. Such negligence and disregard for the regulations, if not strictly rectified, the future of education is unimaginable. Therefore, it is ordered again and again that all schools must strictly abide by the regulations and handle the reporting of registration documents in accordance with the prescribed time limit, and must not ask for leniency on the grounds of various excuses. If the above-mentioned incidents of non-compliance with the regulations are discovered in the future, in addition to the fact that the student's registration will not be recognized, the school will be shut down and will not be tolerated. Do not say that it has not been warned. This order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<p>The Beiyang Alumni Association in Shanghai Raises the Xianhua Fund / Wang Xianhua, former deputy director of the Savings Bank, studied at Beiyang University and died of illness in his Shanghai residence last winter shortly after taking office. The executive committee meeting of the Beiyang University Shanghai Alumni Association in July decided to launch a fundraising campaign for the Xianhua Scholarship Fund, because Wang was very enthusiastic in supporting various affairs in the school during his studies. Therefore, this time, the Beiyang University Shanghai Alumni Association is donating to the Xianhua Scholarship Fund for scholarship matters at the school (now renamed Beiyang Institute of Technology) and as a permanent memorial. In addition, the association's general meeting this year decided to postpone the meeting to October 8th in Hangzhou and hold a joint meeting with the school's Hangzhou alumni.</p>
<p>The Elementary School Principals' Association Initiates a Poster Alliance / The Enrollment Advertisements with the Association's Seal / Will Be Fined One Yuan Per Sheet If Covered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Elementary School Principals' Association, in view of the fact that enrollment advertisements in this city are often covered, which is not economical, the association's executive committee meeting decided to set up a poster alliance to prevent this. The method is recorded as follows: (1) Members of the association may join the poster alliance with a covenant. (2) Joining the alliance is free, but only members of the association are eligible. (3) Members of the alliance can have the "School Association" seal affixed to the membership fee receipt and the poster at the following locations without charge: (A) The Girls' School in Avenue Edward VII, (B) The Shanghai Women's Middle School in Xiejiao, (C) The Sanmin Elementary School in Boundary Road, (D) The Jinghua Elementary and Middle School in Baoding Road, The Yuandong Elementary School in Diswei Road, (E) The Binhai Elementary School in Jing'an Temple Road, (F) The Chongshi Elementary School in Beile Road. (4) Advertisements with the "School Association" seal may not be covered, otherwise a fine of one yuan per sheet will be charged if found. The covenant is as follows: I hereby join the poster alliance and am willing to abide by the covenant. I will not cover any poster that has been sealed with the "School Association" seal, otherwise I am willing to be fined one yuan per sheet if found. This document is for future reference.</p>

<p>Recent News from Jiangxi Senior Vocational School / More Than 100 New Students Admitted / Actively Handling Registration Procedures</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Senior Vocational School in Nanshi, Shanghai, was originally established by the Jiangxi Shanghai Alumni Association with a large building and comprehensive vocational courses and facilities. It has been operating for a year with remarkable results. In April of this year, it submitted an application for opening and has been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education for record filing. Now that the school's autumn semester is approaching, it has recruited new students in Nanchang, Jiujiang, Shangrao, Guangfeng, and other places, and more than 100 have been admitted. The registration for new students in this city on August 6th is also very enthusiastic. It is reported that the school authorities, with the increase in students and the increasing complexity of affairs after the start of the semester, are now planning the school's organization and equipment, and are actively rushing to handle the registration procedures, which will be reported immediately after the start of the semester.</p>
<p>Weiyu Elementary School Expands School Buildings / The Weiyu Elementary School on Lafayette Road in this city has a practical curriculum, complete facilities, and excellent results, which are praised by the society. Therefore, although the number of students is limited, there are still many applicants, all of whom are children of leaders in the industrial and educational circles. The school building is very spacious, and there are schoolyard playgrounds, and it is close to the French Concession Park, which has an excellent environment. Now it is known that the school has expanded the school building in front of the original school building, which is a very beautiful Western-style house with lawns and flowers, which will be used as dormitories in the future. It is scheduled to recruit students on August 20th and start school on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Chizhi Middle School Focuses on Student Management / The affiliated middle school of Chizhi College will move to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Road from the next semester, where it will hold classes in its own school building, which has been reported in previous newspapers. In the past two years, the school has been renting school buildings in the concession, which are small and close to the market, which is inconvenient for management and teaching. It is now known that the school authorities have decided to implement a tutor system after the relocation in the autumn of this year, and will be absolutely strict in teaching and education, so that each student's curriculum and extracurricular work will be individually guided by teachers. On weekdays, students will not be allowed to leave the school gate without a letter of request from their parents. In the evening, teachers will supervise them in the classroom for self-study at a set time, in order to ensure that students' academic performance and conduct are excellent. It is reported that the school is scheduled to recruit new first-year students of high school and junior high school and transfer students of all grades on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Chengdong Women's Middle School Registered / The Chengdong Women's School on Huayi Street, Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi, Shanghai, was founded in the Qing Dynasty, and many talents have emerged. Its primary school and kindergarten were registered with the Municipal Bureau of Education long ago. In 1932, a middle school was added. Since Ms. Shan Fangying became the principal last summer, she has been working hard to make progress. Now it has also been approved and registered by the Municipal Bureau of Education. The development in the future is unlimited. It is reported that the school is scheduled to recruit new students on August 20th, and the number of applicants has been endless in recent days.</p>
<p>School News / Huahai Vocational School: Since Principal Qiu has been planning with all his heart, the school affairs of Huahai Vocational School in this city have progressed extremely rapidly. The school is committed to cultivating specialized talents and guaranteeing students' careers, so it is very cautious about enrollment. This autumn, it will only recruit new first-year students of senior business, secretarial, and accounting courses, and junior business and bookkeeping courses. The first examination of the school was held on the 23rd of last month, and the candidates were very enthusiastic. Only 46 new students were admitted for the first time. The second examination of the school will be held on the 14th of this month, and the applications have been very enthusiastic from near and far.

<p>Guangxia Middle School: Guangxia Middle School on Xinzha Road has always been known for its strict management and complete equipment in Shanghai. Male and female students are managed separately, so female students are also exceptionally developed. Principal Lu Xirong, in view of the fact that the number of female applicants this year has exceeded the quota, has specially increased the number of female students to 40 to accommodate the female students who come to study. It is reported that the new student examination will be held on August 14th and 15th.</p>
<p>Meihua Girls' Middle School: The Meihua Girls' Middle School on Carter Road in this city has recently expanded its facilities and various books in order to improve them.

<p>The First China Vocational Supplementary School: The number of graduates from various departments of the First China Vocational Supplementary School on Hualong Road in this city has reached thousands. The school's alumni association was established in March of this year. Due to time constraints, the solicitation has not been widespread, and most alumni have either changed their addresses or have no records to refer to, so it is inevitable that some will be missed. It is now known that the alumni association, in order to reorganize and promote the association's affairs, in addition to formally notifying those who have joined, those who have incomplete membership procedures or have not yet registered to join must send their names and contact addresses to the General Affairs Group on the third floor of the school before August 11th for formal registration.</p>

<p>Business News, Finance, Overseas Silver Prices Continue to Rise, Mark Fees Reduced Again by 1 Yuan 7 Jiao</p>
<p>Central Bank's Spot Silver Plummets</p>
<p>Overall Market Trend Low, Then Recovers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw silver prices continue to rise, initially trending downward, but due to the Central Bank's strong intervention and active buying in the spot market, the decline was arrested. Ultimately, news of a further drop in overnight silver prices by 0.3375 spurred renewed confidence and a recovery.  The morning began with further gains in overseas silver markets in the UK and US, with forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rising by 0.025 to 0.03. Exchange rates eased slightly, London spot gold remained stable, US cotton fell 9 points, and US wheat declined 1.875 points. Stocks dipped slightly. Commodity brokers initially offered taels at around 6 yuan, as did gold dealers in pre-market trading. However, the Central Bank's intervention in the spot market, with aggressive purchases by companies like Fu Tai Heng, Rui Kang, and Fu Chang, stabilized the trend significantly. After the opening, banks became less eager to buy. While sellers were willing to trade, sufficient spot silver bars had not yet arrived. HSBC's exchange rates for both British and American currencies remained unchanged, indicating a firm trend. Ultimately, due to banks actively selling into the exchange market, prices could not be held tightly. Ample supply emerged at higher levels, leading to a pullback. Subsequently, supply and demand balanced, and gold prices entered a period of fluctuation, hovering around 7 yuan. It is believed that HSBC engaged in some support buying, and banks also took on some forward US dollar positions. News from Reuters of a sharp drop in Seattle overnight silver prices by 0.3375, 0.2625, 0.2625, and 0.1875 boosted confidence and revived buying interest, leading to an upward surge. However, a retracement occurred after the peak, though its extent was limited. The situation stabilized around noon, and market conditions remained generally unremarkable in the first half of the day. The range was narrow, and spot market activity was subdued. Tianjin silver was priced approximately 12.5 yuan higher, as swap rates approached parity. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 986.6 yuan, a decrease of 3.2 yuan from the previous close. Commodity openings were at 6.7 yuan. The morning opening exchange rates were a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 4 1/8 pence for the British pound and 33.9375 yuan for the US dollar.  While banks actively sold, the Central Bank's purchase of over 1,000 spot bars boosted confidence among Chinese merchants. Although Yuan Mao Yong sold in the market, Rui Kang, Fu Tai Heng, and Fu Chang displayed the strongest buying appetite. Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Tai Chang, Yong Li Yong Feng, and Da De Cheng joined forces in purchasing bars, gradually pushing prices higher. While Yu Qing Yong and Hong Li sold, there was a slight pause before prices rose to 7.9 yuan. Citibank and Chase offered October US dollars at 34 yuan. Fu Xing Yong and commodity brokers sold at 7 yuan. Da Chang Xiang continued buying, pushing prices even higher. Da De Cheng and Heng Yu bought and then sold, retreating from 7.8 yuan to below 7 yuan, reaching 6.8 yuan. However, HSBC's unchanged exchange rate announcement kept sentiment stable. Fu Tai Heng, Heng Tai, and Tong Feng Heng bought, pushing prices up to 7.8 yuan. Shanghai offered October US dollars at 1.25. Yu Qing Yong and Fu Xing Yong supplied bars, leading to further downward pressure. Zhao Feng Chang and Wan Xing even sold at 6.7 yuan. Sumitomo sought November US dollars at 0.25. Bing Xing Lai bought, stabilizing prices. When Reuters reported a drop in overnight silver prices by 0.3375, Heng Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Yu, Rui Xing, Yu Qing Yong, Da De Cheng, and others rushed to buy, causing prices to surge to 8.7 yuan. Qian Chang Xiang, Tai, and Ding Chang took advantage of the high prices to sell bars. Chase offered September US dollars at 34 yuan, and prices retreated to 7.6 yuan. Yi Cheng and Yong Li still showed interest, pushing prices up to 8.5 yuan. Sumitomo sought November US dollars at 0.25. Yuan Yi sold off, and the noon closing price was 988.1 yuan. Commodities were auctioned at 8.3 yuan, with the market stronger after the close. The highest price during the half-day was 988.7 yuan, and the lowest was 986.6 yuan, a difference of 2.1 yuan. Ultimately, the closing price was 1.7 yuan lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC's unchanged US dollar exchange rate of 33.625 yuan, resulting in a calculated mark fee of 1029 yuan. Based on the closing price, the discount was approximately 41 yuan, slightly less than the previous close's discount of less than 2 yuan. August ledger entries were 988 yuan, and September entries were also 988 yuan. The replenishment price in the morning was 988 yuan. The spot market was quiet, with limited trading. Tianjin silver was priced approximately 12.5 yuan higher, as the swap premium was expected to be cleared. The Central Bank opened approximately 1,400 spot bars in total, priced at 986.5 yuan. Within this total, a portion was priced at 987 yuan, sold by Fu Chang. Rui Kang and Fu Tai Heng bought swaps in the market, while Da De Cheng offered 105 bars to Qian Chang Xiang at a mere 0.2 jiao. Today's public contracts totaled 720 bars for settlement.</p>
<p>In market transactions, demand exceeded supply. Overall, Fu Chang, Rui Kang, Fu Tai Heng, Yong Li Feng Tai, Tong Chun, Hui Xiang, Chun Yuan, Yong Hong, Yong Rui Xing, Da Kang, Tong Tai Chang, Shun Li, and Yong Feng were buyers. Yu Qing Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Yi Feng Shui, Yi Yu, Ying Feng, Heng Ding Chang, Da Fa, Yong Heng Tai, Fu Yu, Fu An, and Wan Xing were sellers. Da De Cheng, Tong Tai Chang, and Yong De Heng first bought and then sold. Yu Qing Yong, Fu Xing Yong, and Fu Yu first sold and then bought. Da Lian's Shun Li traded a total of over 700 bars, netting over 400 bars. Wan Xing traded a total of over 700 bars, netting approximately 100 bars. Guang's trading volume was limited. The total number of transactions for the day was 29,505 bars.</p>

Although banks sold after the opening, the Central Bank's purchase of spot silver strengthened confidence among Chinese merchants, and the underlying trend remained tight. HSBC's announced exchange rates showed no change for both British and American currencies. At this point, the process was stable. However, banks continued to sell US dollars without any change.

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Continued Selling of Series 4 Government Bonds, Rallying Momentum Slightly Reduced</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw no changes. Mr. Huang Fu has agreed to go north. However, the supply and demand of chips on the trading floor were quite unbalanced. The continued selling of Series 4 intensified, with nearly all of the previously acquired 20 rolls of 20 interest contracts being dumped. The market price suffered a setback due to this pressure, with the rally repeatedly being suppressed and reduced. The trend will likely only recover after Series 4 is sold out. The selling volume has been substantial, and even if there is a remaining balance, it is likely to be in its final stages. Whether these sold contracts will be repurchased remains uncertain. On the buying side, Series 5, 11, 23, 32, and 53 all have considerable strength, indicating that there will be many changes in the future. Yesterday, most forecasts predicted a positive start. The opening for retrenchment and disbandment was stable. Subsequently, sellers gradually emerged, with Series 4 selling most aggressively, preventing the market price from stabilizing, falling 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and even 0.8 to 0.9 yuan. Secondary small investors also sold, following the trend, which was unavoidable. Slight rallies were met with setbacks, and the situation seemed chaotic. Price movements were primarily dictated by Series 4. The resulting market price fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and even 1.35 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 25 million yuan. The Exchange announced that half-day trading would be extended by half a month, meaning that only two trading sessions will be held each day from now on. The results of the price fluctuations are compared in the table below (in yuan).</p>

<p>New York Railroad Stocks Experience Heavy Selling</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (July 31st), the New York Stock Exchange's market was mixed with a slight increase. However, railroad stocks experienced more selling, and the decline was significant, due to increased operating expenses and decreased income across the board. Small Exchange stocks fluctuated, eventually rising slightly. The bond market saw a mixed slight decline due to President Hindenburg's critical illness, which weakened Central European government bonds. Chicago wheat benefited from slightly better crop and weather news, and the market had already risen for several days, triggering a correction of slightly over 0.01. The total trading volume was 590,000 shares. Also, this firm's New York agent reports: (Securities) The market sentiment is still firm, but buyers lack interest. (Grains) Initially, due to a lack of new buyers and weakness in Liverpool and maize, prices fell. This decline triggered new buying, leading to a recovery. Canadian crops continue to suffer from blight. (Cotton) Although the government guarantees the sale of large quantities of cotton in an orderly fashion, the market sentiment is ultimately softened by the sale of 1.95 million bales of cotton starting on August 1st. It is also heard that transaction taxes will continue to be levied, and strikes in Alabama are likely to spread, which also has a negative impact on the market. Crop reports from Texas and Oklahoma remain poor. (Rubber) Some selling is due to the non-implementation of the establishment of a control committee. Currently, buyers are lacking. (Sugar) The market is stable and firm, with strong spot demand and few sellers. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Date, July 30, July 31, Change</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton, Strong Demand in Both North and South, Spot Yarn and Near-Term Yarn Longs Active</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be firm, and the trend remains strong, as spot yarn sales remain robust. Procurement from North China remains strong, and interest from southern ports is also increasing. This tightens sentiment and intensifies buying interest, making the near-term market particularly strong. However, Japanese merchants still show no intention of covering short positions. According to some inquiries, foreign firms have a shortfall of 30,000 to 40,000 bales, putting pressure on the market. Jin Ji is gradually rising.</p>
<p>The morning opening for standard yarn saw a buoyant market sentiment, with Tianjin buyers continuing to procure, triggering long activity and tightening the near-term market. The market gradually rose. However, there was still no news of Japanese merchants covering their short positions. As a result, prices for each month rose by 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 jiao. The total number of transactions was 24,900 bales. The selling volume included 800 bales of Ji Feng, 450 bales of Da Feng, 600 bales of Yuan Da, 900 bales of Jin Chang, 850 bales of Shen Chang, 850 bales of Rui Da, 1,250 bales of Yuan Da, 1,050 bales of Shen Ji, 500 bales of Yuan Tai, and 1,100 bales of Da Chang.

<p>Drought Hinders Cotton Plant Growth, Cotton Merchants Intensify Buying Interest</p>
<p>The cotton market remains firm, although US cotton has retreated slightly. However, local sentiment is still good, as the recent drought has affected cotton fields in several areas, and some speculators are bullish on the future of US cotton. Therefore, there is a strong long bias in standard cotton trading. However, manufacturers remain inactive in procuring cotton.</p>
<p>Standard cotton opened flat this morning. The market sentiment softened due to the retreat of US cotton. However, by the second and third rounds of trading, the market atmosphere tightened, as the trading floor was dry and bulls were unwilling to release their positions. However, spot cotton sales are sluggish, and manufacturers are still reluctant to buy, leaving the market entirely dominated by speculators. As a result, each month's prices rose by 0.15 to 0.25 jiao. The total number of transactions was 69,600 dan.

<p>Grain Futures and Flour Markets Closed All Day</p>
<p>Continuous Surges Yesterday Required Special Clearing and Margin Calls</p>
<p>The flour market, due to the continuous rise in prices, saw a large number of short positions facing margin calls. Yesterday, the market was specially closed for one day to clear margin calls. It is heard that the exchange has received 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. It is expected that trading will resume normally today. However, after the sharp rise in the wheat market, the market may be in a chaotic state after it reopens.</p>
<p>Flooding in Northern Manchuria Intensifies Wheat Futures Surge</p>
<p>Margin Calls Mid-Session Halt Trading to Control the Surge</p>
<p>Another Surge of 0.28 to 0.29 Yuan in Each Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, each month saw another surge. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuated by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan in the past two days, as if it were inconsequential. However, market sentiment inside and outside the industry remains extremely tense. The flooding in Northern Manchuria has caused panic among food merchants in the area. At the end of last month, flour was selling briskly, and wheat had also been purchased. Therefore, quotations have risen sharply within this month, with a huge increase of 0.1 yuan. The price rise for distant months was even more dramatic, reaching an increase of 0.17 to 0.18 yuan. To avoid danger, trading was halted to collect margin calls from short positions. As a result, there were three trading sessions until the margin calls were cleared in the afternoon, when trading resumed. However, sentiment remains strong, and the surge in prices for each month is becoming more and more severe. Major players in the street continue to aggressively buy. It is heard that buyers from Northern China are also numerous, causing prices to increase wildly. It seems that there is a disaster in front of us, and the situation is out of control. The government, which is concerned about the people's food supply, cannot stand idly by and should come forward to maintain stability. As a result, this month's price rose by 0.24 yuan, September's by 0.29 yuan, October's by 0.28 yuan, November's by 0.22 yuan, and December's by 0.22 yuan. The spot wheat market also saw price increases. However, the wheat that was offered was all bought up by industry insiders, and prices rose by 0.15 yuan. The highest price has reached 0.37 yuan, but factories have not moved.</p>
<p>Two Batches of Orders from Saigon Have Arrived</p>
<p>10,855 Bags</p>
<p>Inferior Broken Rice Weak, Native Glutinous Rice Returned to Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's Saigon rice market, due to the eagerness of buyers from the hinterland and the activity of those on the street, should have continued to rise. However, the arrival of rice from all directions has been sporadic and inferior, with no large shipments arriving in Shanghai for a long time. Due to the drought in the hinterland, demand is high, and market prices should have gradually increased. However, foreign rice orders that were rushed to be loaded first have already arrived in Shanghai. After the first batch arrived last month, the second batch arrived yesterday, totaling 10,855 bags of Saigon No. 1, imported by the company ship "Dada Yao" and docked at the China Merchants Warehouse. The samples have already been shown on the market yesterday. It is said that the cost of this batch is about 1</p>
<h3>Vienna Second Execution Situation</h3>
<p>Shouting "Heil Hitler!"</p>
<p>Vienna - The murderers who shot and killed Dollfuss were hanged this afternoon at 5 PM in the courtyard of the court. According to military law, all criminal sentences must be carried out within three hours of the verdict, with the exception of those granted special pardons by the President. Therefore, the hanging of the two criminals, Holzweber and Pollanetz, also took place three hours after the verdict. The court proceedings were also noteworthy. The defendant's lawyer, Dr. Chroust, delivered passionate speeches and was repeatedly condemned by the prosecutor, but he showed a spirit of not being intimidated by authority. He stated that a portion of the Austrian people are striving for the unification of Austria and Germany, but their sincerity in loving their country is no less than that of the pro-independence faction who oppose them. If the two criminals cannot escape death, then their deaths are no less glorious than that of Leo Schlageter, who died for his country when the French army invaded the Ruhr region. Dr. Chroust then declared that when these traitors were allowed to surrender, government officials formally promised to send them to the Austrian border. The government's current actions are tantamount to going back on their word. Chroust also stated to the court that the court also has an obligation to listen to the intentions of other government officials, such as Chancellor Dollfuss, who repeatedly stated during the May Day events that there would be no more bloodshed. Therefore, the court should not disregard his words. However, the court ultimately rejected his plea and sentenced the two criminals to death. Pollanetz then slowly stood up and declared, "I am not a murderer. I originally did not want to kill Chancellor Dollfuss. I humbly beg Mrs. Dollfuss to forgive me." Holzweber also stood up and shouted, "I did not commit murder. Before we set off, we were clearly ordered not to shed blood. We all believed that we could see Minister Rintelen as soon as we entered the Chancellor's office, at least that was the order we received the next day. I can only say that my actions were out of ardent love for the fatherland." After the execution of the two criminals, official news was released stating that the two criminals were extremely calm before their deaths and their expressions remained unchanged during the execution. When the executioner stepped on the trapdoor, they shouted, "We die for Germany! Heil Hitler!" (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna - Panneta, who confessed to killing Dr. Dollfuss, and Holzweber, the leader of the July 24th occupation of the Chancellery, were sentenced to death by a military court today and hanged this afternoon. The executioner was a Mr. Langer, who is usually a bank clerk. Today, he wore a tall hat and a black coat to the execution ground. His reward was five English pounds, but he still had to allocate some to his two assistants. However, the execution rope will belong to whoever wants it. If there are collectors of memorabilia, it can be easily exchanged for some money. Before Holzweber went to his execution, when he said goodbye to his wife, he still praised National Socialism. When he put his neck in the noose, he shouted "Heil Hitler!" several times. (31st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Russia and the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Puppet State Requests Russia to Withdraw Troops from the Border</p>
<p>Russia Denies Aerial Reconnaissance of Suifenhe</p>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry today sent a strongly worded official document to the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slavutsky, demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops stationed in Dongtaisheng (transliteration) because that area belongs to "Manchukuo." If the Soviet Union does not comply, "Manchukuo" reserves the right to take any necessary action. After receiving the document, the Soviet Consul went to the Harbin Office of the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry and verbally refuted "Manchukuo's" previous protest, saying that the Soviet plane flying over Suifenhe on July 16 and taking aerial photographs was completely untrue. The Harbin Times, run by anti-Russian Japanese, carried news today that "Manchukuo" may ask the Soviet Union to completely withdraw Russian consuls stationed in the new state, but this claim cannot be verified and should not be acted upon hastily.

<h3>Japan's Policy Towards Manchuria</h3>
<p>Conflicting Opinions Between Foreign and Military Ministries</p>
<p>One Emphasizes Recognition, the Other Emphasizes War Preparations</p>
<p>From a Three-Way to a Two-Way Integrated System</p>
<p>The Japanese Colonization Ministry Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the policy towards Manchuria, Foreign Minister Hirota and Military Minister Hayashi have conflicting opinions. According to reporters, Hirota advocates for the complete independence of the puppet state of Manchukuo. The Kwantung Army should not interfere in the puppet state's politics and diplomacy as much as possible, and promote Manchukuo's appearance as a state with the rule of law. Hayashi believes that war will break out before other countries recognize Manchukuo, so national defense should be the primary focus, and other matters should be handled under this principle. Hirota also believes that in order to entice various countries to recognize Manchukuo, special treatment should be given to those who recognize the puppet state or those who establish consular offices in the puppet state and directly notify the puppet organization, allowing them to invest. However, Military Minister Hayashi does not emphasize the issue of recognition based on the above principle. (1st China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tani Masayuki, a counselor at the "Manchukuo" Embassy, is scheduled to return to Japan from Manchuria within the next few days to report on the comprehensive opinions of the military, foreign affairs, and other agencies stationed in Manchuria. The relevant agencies, such as the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry, plan to hold a coordination meeting and invite Tani Masayuki to attend and discuss the policy towards the "Manchukuo." Japan has always adopted a three-way integrated system for its policy towards Manchuria, with the Kwantung Army, the "Manchukuo" Embassy, and the Kwantung Government as its implementing agencies. However, various inconveniences arise each time a policy is implemented, making it impossible to achieve the objectives. Therefore, the opinion of abolishing the three-way integrated system and changing it to a two-way integrated system is gradually gaining momentum. According to the opinions of the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry, the implementation of the policy towards "Manchukuo" should be the responsibility of the Kwantung Army and the embassy stationed in Manchuria. The Kwantung Government should be changed to a local administrative agency and its powers should be reduced. It should only be able to supervise the South Manchuria Railway and other agencies. The supervisory power, police power, etc. over the South Manchuria Railway business, the Oriental Development Company, and other special companies in "Manchukuo" should all be歸by the Foreign Ministry. If this plan can be realized, the authority of the Colonization Ministry in Manchuria will have to be reduced to within the Kwantung Leased Territory, and the resolution of extraterritorial rights, the administrative rights of the South Manchuria Railway zone, etc. can be expected. (1st Japan Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Colonization Ministry believes that the two-way integrated system violates the fundamental meaning of the establishment of the Colonization Ministry and contradicts Prime Minister Okada's explicit statements. Therefore, it absolutely opposes it. However, the current agencies stationed in "Manchuria" have undergone changes in "Manchukuo" after the establishment of the country. It is fully acknowledged that there is a need for appropriate reforms. A suitable plan should be sought. However, if the authority of the Colonization Ministry is abolished or reduced, it will be resolutely opposed. (1st Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) President of the House of Peers, Fumimaro Konoe, returned home on the Tatsuta Maru at 10:30 AM today and returned to Tokyo by the Sakuragicho train at 2 PM. Konoe's remarks are as follows: I met with President Roosevelt and other American dignitaries. What they are currently paying attention to is the political trends in Japan, especially whether Japanese politics are monopolized by the military. They believe that Japan's political actions in the Far East undermine their principles of maintaining the post-war world peace structure. Most of them now feel that it is necessary to re-recognize the situation in the Far East rather than the principle. As for the disarmament conference, experts are convinced that Japan already has an advantage in the Far East under the current ratio. In general, it is not believed that Japan has no reason to demand a change in the ratio. (1st Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<h3>Paris Rapidly Deploys Air Defenses</h3>
<p>Gas Masks Sold Publicly</p>
<p>Electrical Switchboard Set Up Underground</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is actively teaching citizens self-defense, giving the impression that war is imminent. The Paris Police Department announced today that an emergency defense plan has now been drafted. For example, gas masks are now sold publicly, and testing facilities have also been opened. Those who have prepared gas masks can go to test them freely. All electrical businesses plan to move underground and set up a central switchboard to connect all the lights in Paris and control their switching on and off. This can be used in wartime and in emergencies. Once an air raid occurs, Paris can be plunged into darkness in an instant. All other air defense equipment is available. It can be used next week. Leaflets training citizens to prevent air raids will also be distributed to the public. The total air defense cost has been determined to be 20 million francs. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Okada's Remarks to Japan Arouse American Reaction</h3>
<p>Considered Irrelevant</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Prime Minister Okada met with foreign reporters for the first time after forming his cabinet yesterday and made a statement suggesting that the countries with the strongest armaments should first reduce their naval strength. There has been no reaction here. Officials believe that one of the most optimistic points in Okada's remarks is that Okada himself is a naval admiral who is sympathetic to the navy and has even spoken of disarmament. All previous opinions expressed by Japanese people have been in favor of expanding the navy. However, it is unknown which country Okada is referring to as the "country with the strongest armaments." According to the majority of diplomatic and government personnel, Japan's own navy is more substantial than that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the US naval authorities are determined not to reduce the US fleet to an equal strength as Japan. US naval experts consider the current US fleet to be strategically equal to Japan's because the US has a long coastline and territories that extend overseas. Therefore, although it has a large number of battleships, it does not actually have an advantage. The United Kingdom is the same. Although Okada's words are very humble, they are completely irrelevant and can be interpreted in many ways. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Baldwin's Words Arouse Speculation in Various Countries</h3>
<p>The United States Considers it an Important International Matter</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington diplomatic community today believes that the remarks made by British Acting Prime Minister Baldwin in the House of Commons yesterday are very important internationally. Baldwin's remarks represent the shared thinking of world politicians over the past decade, that the border defended by the air force is far beyond a country's political border. Republican Senator Bingham declared that after the air force strength of European countries was revealed, the United States' need for aircraft carriers and flight deck cruisers was even more urgent. Democratic Senator McGado also said that the United States, like the United Kingdom, should have an appropriate line of defense outside its coast, especially Honolulu, and should strengthen its defense in the sea, land, and air. As for the Atlantic, the United States' security is deeply threatened by the development of European aviation. Therefore, McGado advocates that all of the West Indies should fly the American flag. The diplomatic community believes that Baldwin's remarks can further consolidate the relationship between the United Kingdom and France. Baldwin once said that if the countries of Central Europe are detrimental to France, the British and French air forces should jointly resist, with the Rhine River as the border. Some in the diplomatic community believe that Baldwin's remarks are tantamount to supporting Japan, because Tokyo has always claimed that Japan's actions in Manchuria are to expand its national defense to beyond its actual borders. However, it should be noted that the British and French cooperative air force defense line has a hypothetical enemy, while Japan in Manchuria is acting arbitrarily, and its national defense is expanding into the territory of a neutral and friendly country, which is strange. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels - Yesterday, British Acting Prime Minister Baldwin gave a speech in the House of Commons regarding the procedure for air force expansion, in which he said, "If we consider the national defense of the United Kingdom, it is no longer on the cliffs of the Dover coast, but on the Rhine River." The Belgian side was greatly pleased to hear this statement, and all newspapers published it. The newspapers also said that two weeks ago, Foreign Minister Simon firmly stated that the territorial integrity of Belgium is an essential element of British security, and this is even more true now than it was in the past. Baldwin's speech has greatly increased the effectiveness of Simon's statement. The newspapers all argue that Belgium will be able to obtain guarantees from the United Kingdom in times of emergency based on the Locarno Treaty. (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Acting Prime Minister Baldwin declared in Parliament on Monday that he had said, "The British front line is on the Rhine, not on Dover." The French newspapers unanimously wrote extensively about this. In fact, Baldwin's intention was merely to say that the situation has changed due to the progress of the air force. The French newspapers misinterpreted his intention as evidence of Anglo-French cooperation. Some newspapers even said that the Netherlands will be the gateway to the United Kingdom.
