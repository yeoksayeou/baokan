<h3>英荷密約與英海軍會議　英</h3>
<p>自日本攫取滿洲積極備戰後。遠東和平。卽瀕危險。近又挾持傀儡稱帝。力圖進行遠東市塲獨佔政策。不但使美蘇爲之側目。尤使英法意荷在遠東之利益。感受不安。意首相墨索里尼發表黃禍論於前。法前總理赫理歐慨論遠東危機於後。而今日英國所召集之新加坡帝國海軍軍事會議。日人重視之至目爲太平洋之暗雲。可見各國對於日本之獨佔政策。正急起以謀應付。針鋒相對。勢已顯然矣。至於荷蘭。以一歐州小邦。素重殖民利益。尤以遠在太平洋東印度羣島之天然富源爲國力之核心。故其對於日本野心之戒備。無時或釋。據前日日聯社電。日本芝加哥領事武藤電達日外務省。謂芝加哥當地某報曾發表荷蘭已因東印度領地關係。與英國成立秘密海軍恊定。并著社評稱。「荷屬東印度危險之對象爲日本。其理由則爲婆羅洲之石油問題。恐有糾紛。故荷蘭欲以置諸英國海軍保護之下。」由兹推測。關於該恊定之内容如何。雖猶無所聞悉。而荷蘭爲保障利益計。進與英人結合。則大有可能性。蓋就荷屬東印度羣局之經濟地位。對日本之關係以言。亦與遠東和平前途。大有關係也。</p>
<p>通常所謂荷蘭東印度羣島。係包括爪哇。蘇門塔臘。荷屬波羅洲。西里伯。及其他多數島嶼之總稱。總面積約達七十四萬方英里。約七倍於菲律濱羣島。十四倍於英屬馬萊半島。有人口六千餘萬。而菲律濱則不過一千三百萬。馬萊半島尚不足五百萬。地處菲律濱之西南。介乎太平印度兩洋之間。物資之富。如樹膠糖茶以及煤錫石油之屬。靡不具備。日本之移民植資於其間者。已非一朝一夕。幾儼然形成今日南洋日本經濟勢力之中心。</p>
<p>其次。日本在東印度之貿易關係。亦處絶對優勝之地位。以一九三二年而論。日本向東印度之進口。總額已達一萬萬日金之巨。在荷英德美諸國以上。同年日本由東印度之出口總額。則不過四千萬日金。可見日本商品在東印度市塲。頗足以壓倒英荷諸國。而居於出超之地位。</p>
<p>再次。荷屬波羅洲年產石油約五百萬米噸。當美國年產總額二十分之一。爲亞洲方面次於波斯而極重要之油源。日本向爲石油輸入之國家。其半數以上悉由東印度供給。以一九三三年十一個月論。全國輸入石油比重在零點八七六二以下者。約十二萬萬加倫。而自東印度輸入者。竟有六萬萬加倫之巨。全國輸入石油比重在零點七三以下者。約七十三萬加倫。而自東印度輸入者。竟達六十七萬加倫。此足徴波羅洲石油礦對於日本經濟國防上重要性之程度焉。</p>
<p>由上以言。日本對於荷屬東印度之經濟地位。實已獲得極密切之關係。彼日人苟一旦有事於南洋經濟之侵略。不惜與英人之遠東利益發生嚴重之衝突者。則英之危險爲何如。英國旣在遠東海軍地位。感受此重大威脅。自不能不與荷蘭携手。利害相同。必相接近。勢使然也。</p>
<p>雖然。日本軍閥極力造成亞洲門羅政策之實現。亦徒挑起他國之惡感耳。英屬地受日本經濟侵略之刺激旣多。不得不於海軍謀所以防禦之策。故新加坡之海軍會議。雖尚未明悉其内容。然其對日必有一種嚴密之布置可以預測。而一方面又運用其外交手段。以與荷蘭聯絡。軍略與外交並進。其所鈎心鬭角以應付日本者。亦可謂爲極盡能事。此日人所以感覺太平洋戰雲之暗淡。而危懼不能自安歟。</p>

<h3>齋藤宣布施政方針廣田演說外交</h3>
<p>卵翼僞滿組織對華誘致親善</p>
<p>對俄侈言和平對美緩和感情</p>
<p>（東京）休會後之議會、木日上午十時開會、先由齋藤首相在貴院演說施政方針、約二十分鐘、次由廣田外相演說外交方針約二十分鐘、於是研究會之二荒伯關於思想問題、承質問戰之第一陣、開始銳敏之質問、衆院於午後一時開會、由齋藤廣田兩相爲同樣之演說後、繼由高橋藏相演說財政方針、由政友之床次竹二郎放質問之第一矢、民政之町田忠治繼之、繼續沉默數年之兩黨首腦部鬥士、開始銳敏之質問戰（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相本日上午十一時在貴族院演說外交方針、其全文如下、</p>
<p>日本政府與國際聯盟、關於滿洲事件·「滿洲國」問題·及維持東亞和平之根本意義上、其意見不幸大相懸殊、情出不已、乃致通告退出國聯、而在决定此重大事件之際、天皇陛下頒布上諭、明確宣示我國應取之出路、其詔曰、</p>
<p>「日本此次處於「滿洲國」新興之時、以尊重其獨立、促進其健全發達爲除去東亞禍根、保障世界和平之根基、又謂「雖然朕常冀求國際和平之確立、無時或已、因此凡屬一切和平企圖、今後仍與各國恊力不渝、現雖與國聯分離、依從帝國之所信、然固非偏於東亞、而忽視友邦交誼、蓋篤大信於國際、顯大義於宇内、乃朕所夙夜繫念阇也」云云、</p>
<p>我國國民今後更當恊同一致、努力期副聖旨、則帝國光明正大之態度、必致澈底於世界、帝國前途充滿光輝、堂余處理對外關係之時、奉此聖旨、傾注渾身努力「以世界和平爲念、依外交手段貫徹我國方針」、幸帝國與友邦各國之關係、於退出國聯之後、外交及通商貿易上更加增密接與親善、實不勝慶幸之至、</p>
<h3>扶助僞國獨立</h3>
<p>與帝國有緊密而特别關係之「滿洲國」自建國以來、以英邁之溥儀執政及該國政府當局之不斷努力、與帝國根基於日滿議定書精神之援助、着着進行其建設步驟諸般施設漸次就緒、尤以其治安之維持、產業交通之發展、財政之確立及文敎之進展等、非但能舉其顯著成績、且該國朝野所翹望之帝政問題亦將近實現、新興獨立國之基礎愈加鞏固、此不獨堪爲「滿洲國」額手稱度、更可爲遠東和平世界和平賀也、吾人今後亦當奉行聖旨之所明示、官民相携、廣爲該國發展上與以極力之援助、</p>
<h3>對華高唱善鄰</h3>
<p>日本政府關於維持東亞和平、覺有重大責任、且抱其確乎不拔之决心、而信中國本身之安定、爲東亞和平上最關緊要之情形、因此之故、中國應從速恢復其治安與繁榮、乃爲日本政府所衷心希望者、中日兩國常保善鄰互相關係、以貢獻於東亞和平與發達、可謂當然之使命也、然試觀中國政局、現尚遠離於如是希望之實現、實遺憾之極、據接到情報、中國政府至最近方悟從前所採抗日政策之非、决定打開中日關係之方針、然迄本日爲止、未能發見證明此項情報之具體事實、若果中國諒解日本之眞意、現實表示誠意、則日本早有不惜盡量順應中國之好意與態度、現在北華地方、其於政務整理委員會統制之下、維持其比較平穏之狀態、實爲可喜、日本政府鑒於「滿洲國」與北華之毘連關係、及維持北華停戰恊定起見、特别關心其治安之維持、而期望不致發現搗亂治安之事態、日本政府同時以深甚注意、關心中國之共產黨活動及共產軍横行情况、</p>
<h3>調整對俄關係</h3>
<p>回顧日本與蘇俄聯邦之國交關係、自大正十四年北平基本條約成立以來、兩國維持其正常接觸關係、」滿洲事變發生後、亦能理解互相立塲、未曾遭遇困難問題之發生、然蘇聯邦最近對我國之態度、非但有若干變更之觀感、且蘇俄聯邦以新聞通信等頻向内外放出、非難我國之聲浪、故意宣傳事態之惡化、而利用於其内治外交上之工作、此實日本深引爲意外而且遺憾之事也、日本政府對於蘇聯邦素取公正態度、不論在滿洲事變以前或以後、始終一貫、未有變更、日本與蘇俄雖於國體與思想上有根本不相融洽之點、然時常將續善鄰關係、且以和平手段努力解决疑案、而於「滿洲國」成立之後、根基於直接毘連境界之日「滿」俄三國間國交關係之調整、爲東亞和平最必要之信念、繼續努力進行此事、現在雖經蘇俄聯邦之宣傳、然日本軍實未在滿俄國境建設任何新軍事佈置、又日本政府自去年六月以來、斡旋兩國中東路賣買交涉、亦不外於此次方針之實行與趣旨也、日本政府確信蘇俄聯邦於最近時期、能致諒解我國誠意、又中東路之賣買交涉、現雖不報在停頓狀態、然希望不久仍能進行其交涉也、</p>
<h3>緩和對美情感</h3>
<p>次視日美關係、可謂日美並無感根本解决困難之問題、日本從來對於美國、衷心希望維持善隣關係、而無故意造成事件之意、同時深信美國亦不惜諒解日本在東亞之地位也、但滿洲事變發生以來、美國對日輿論時趨惡化、而致兩國民間發生感情疏隔之觀、然因日本除樹立東亞百年和平之外、實無他意、故美國方面如能幾分認識東亞特殊情形、諒解我國爲東亞和平安定力之原因、則日</p>
<p>美間感情之緊張、自然緩和、此爲毫無疑義者也、因此日本切實希望兩國鑒於通商貿易上之重要關係、互相加以深刻之諒解、增進歷史上之親善關係、在隔太平洋二大隣邦間、造成名實兩符之太平空氣、</p>
<h3>對英期望親交</h3>
<p>日本與英帝國、其傳統之親交關係、雖於今日毫無摇動、但在東西兩洋處於類似之地理地位、且兩帝國在世界各方面、互相諒解各方立塲、共同恊力爲世界和平貢獻、良有以也、在此意義之下、係於通商貿易問題、調劑其利害、且期望兩國親交關係之增進、日本與英帝國重要一員之印度、其間已發生困難之通商問題、其交涉幸告完結、實爲兩方全局上至堪慶賀之事也、</p>
<h3>排除貿易障碍</h3>
<p>兹通觀最近世界情形、與夫國際關係、皆因政治不安、經濟摇動、思想混亂、極易喪失常態、世界各國民間互相信賴之念、亦因而薄弱、實爲遺憾之事也、如各國開誠佈公、正解彼此立塲、發揮萬邦恊和之大精神、則不論任何問題之解决、必非至難、余信要在各國改良猜疑排他之風習、提高互相信賴恊力之觀念、然在通商貿易方面、通商之障碍未見任何緩和之痕跡、反有增加之惡勢、前在倫敦舉行之世界經濟會議、亦未能達到如期之目的而告星散、近時日本因產業極形發達之結果、貿易大有進農、然諸外國中續出限制一般通商、對於日貨之海外進出、設立種種障碍、日本政府對此正在研究適宜對策、政府因認互相諒解各國獨自文化、爲增進國際間理解之有效辦法、故在此方面、朝野相應擬實施適當施設、</p>
<h3>勗勉舉國協力</h3>
<p>如中所述、日本對外關係、其於現在及將來、種種多事爲不可否認之事實、大凡國勢向上之時、其所遭遇之事端頗多、故我國民應恊力一致、不怠進行、無論遭途任何難局、應有毫不動摇之覺悟與凖備、同時以冷靜且沉毅態度、履行正義方針、執取中庸行爲以當事件、則不但日本將來無感任何不安之必要、且其前途誠圾洋洋希望也、</p>
<h3>恃武力爲後盾</h3>
<p>要之、吾人因日本負全倍責任、爲維持東亞和平唯一礎石、一日不可離此意識、我國外交與國防、均由日本此種重大地位及責任發生、日本國防之本身性質、旣係完全防禦的且自衛的、同時日本外交亦欲貫澈根據於日本使命之正當且合理的主張者也、余信日本此自然且現實之地位、爲世界各國明白理解爲當然之事也、（二十三日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本口蜜腹劍英意表示懷疑</h3>
<p>軍人支配政權侵略野心若揭</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦泰晤士報今日社論、謂日本陸相荒木之辭職、其將爲日本對外政策行將變更之兆歟、雖目前尚未有此種趨勢之明顯證據、但吾人不能無此希望也、日本文治派對於滿洲治安與海陸軍備戰所需經費之鉅大、誠不能無怨言、然終未能减輕日本歷史中之第二次最大預算、顧外相廣田之演詞、内有數點、或可稍减因此政策及荒木言論而起之惶慮、如蘇俄與「滿洲國」間關於中東路之談判、能有進步、則廣田所發日本對俄未有敵意一說之影響、當更爲有力矣、凡讀廣田演詞之英人、對於可認爲辯護性質的言論、不能無感於中、日本在上海滿洲等處之黷武行爲、雖在友邦之英國、亦使人不寗、而屬望日本政治家有眞正復掌握其國事及國家前途支配權之明證云、倫敦每日譯報稱、日本在東亞抱有大帝國野心、今已趨於可疑之餘地、廣田演詞直以日本欲藉口安穏、而置中國全部於其管轄下之意、昭示世界耳、所幸者日本帝國主義之野心、縱非事實、適可使其在行使此種狂大計畫中而自毁其本身耳云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）孟却斯德指導報今日社論批評日本陸相荒木辭職事、謂荒木之兵威與貪得無厭之狂論、已使荒木在過去兩年中處於極顯著之地位、但其同事不盡服從其言、如荒木所發召集關於遠東時事的國際會議之建議、卽其證也、又謂廣田外相之言論、驟視之、似日政府現亟欲口頭安慰蘇俄、但此言之有無價値、惟行爲可證明之、此不過爲對於荒木辭職之可恃的飾詞而已、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　日外相廣田今日在國會所稱日本政策和平、並無對俄備戰意之言論、頗爲意國人士所樂聞、按日本在遠東之活動、早已引起意國之不少惶慮、以海上軍備將起新競爭、而日俄間戰爭以海參威爲目的地者、甚屬可能、聞俄外長李維諾夫由美返俄道出意國時、已曾與意相墨索尼里詳細討論此事、今意人雖樂聞廣田之言、但覺如欲使俄國寬懷、而使美國海上軍備不致再增、則日本此種言論尚須有具體之證據蓋一般輿論以爲日本已使美國對於其在太平洋領士之安全、已發生恐慌也、意國報紙近來屢言及遠東危禍、意相墨索里尼自己亦曾數次歡歐洲有以應付之、就意國而言、所謂危禍者、大都在商業方面、以日本在意國商人之市塲中有劇烈之競爭也、廣田今日演詞中所稱世界市塲商業紊亂一節、意人指世界商塲紊亂、大都乃日人自己所造成、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>齋藤演說施政</h3>
<p>扶掖傀儡爲中心政策</p>
<p>倡多難興邦鼓勵國民</p>
<p>（東京）日國會今晨重開、上院於上午十時十四分開會、齋藤首相及廣田外相繼起演說、首相在其結論云、日本正在内外多難之秋、卽所謂非常時、國難時期卽是國運躍進之時、國民須加一倍决心、突破此試煉時期、（二十三日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日首相齋藤今晨在上院演說其施政方針、其演說大綱如次、去年末誕生皇子、日本國基自此更加穏固、乃爲日本全國之榮幸、外交政策乃遵守上年三月二十七日退出國際聯盟當時所發詔書之宗旨、與諸外國維持友好之關係、並助新國家「滿洲國」之發達爲日本之最重要使命、扶助「滿洲國」乃根據日本維持遠東和平之基本國策、同時可以維持世界之和平、日對世界各國之關係至今不變、至於九年度之預算、採取緊縮方針、全額爲二十二萬萬一千二百餘萬元、因經濟界一陽來復、諸稅可期其自然增收、而提高稅尚非其時、故不敷欵項仍發公債補之、惟其詳細則使財長說明、當此世界經濟凋落時期、日自禁金出口以來、經濟界景况甚好、貿易亦獨自隆昌、但農村之創痍未復原狀、上年來雖盡力謀其救濟方法、尚需更進一步之努力、國民思想日趨極端、國民須加倍注意此事、政府自上年度已設法糾正、傾全力善導思想、研究其對策、文部省又新設敎育調查部、加緊研究方策、政府仍採取米榖法爲其原則、設法提高米價、（二十三日華聯電）</p>
<h3>高橋演說財政</h3>
<p>預算收支不敷甚巨</p>
<p>發行公債以資彌補</p>
<p>（東京）衆議院本日下午一時開會、首相與外相演說後、卽由高橋藏相登壇、演說財政方針、其内容先說明歲入歲出預算之大要後、謂若以普通歲入爲歲入、則致巨額之不足數目、然因政府考慮經濟界現狀、未達實行增稅或樹立其他增加收入計劃之時期、依照上年辦法、以公債財源抵補歲入不足部分、藏相其次說明公債問題、謂日本經濟狀態漸次好轉、昭和九年可得多額之自然增收、由此演進、不久可望回復昭和三四年之歲入狀態、然日本財政非但歲入不足甚大、且其前途有殊甚考慮之必要、因此公債之發行數、須要極端减少、緊急不得已之國防費、亦依照節省方針計量其數、至於其他經費未能任意計入、實不得已之事也、國民對於我國前途、無分歲入歲出兩方面、均要忍耐奮勵、而官民一致打開難關爲要、藏相其次言及日本一般經濟界之情勢、說明一般物價之騰漲、對外貿易之現况、國民購買力與貯蓄力之恢復等情形、表示銀行存欵去年增加七億一千餘萬圓、郵政儲金信託等、亦於同期間各增一億圓與一億六千餘萬圓之事實、繼之陳述政府低利政策、而談及對外貿易之現狀、謂去年日本對外貿易、輸出十九億二十餘萬圓、輸入二十億一千四萬圓、共計三十九億四千萬圓、而入超比上年增加一千八百餘萬圓、又由貿易全悞觀之、金額與分量均有大增加、藏相最後談世界經濟之大勢、謂現在國際通商上、特持公平待遇主義之國極少、世界經濟現狀依然混沌、日本在此情形之下、其經濟界在各方面有好轉之兆、實爲幸福、然達到完全恢復原狀之時期、仍要國民之努力、國民須忘私利、冀成日本永遠勢運爲要、（廿日日聯電）</p>
<h3>提出龐大預算</h3>
<p>（東京）藏相高橋今日在國會提出豫算案、謂因滿洲之支出·緊急救濟·匯兌損失·及國際現局所使國防經費之大增、致豫算案短少甚巨、不能以稅收彌補所增之用費、各項稅收除資本稅外、均見增加、上年共增日金一三一·○○○·○○○元、來年滿洲之支出共日金一六三·○○○·○○○元、其他支出如下、緊急救濟一二五·○○○·○○○元、陸軍一一○·○○○·○○○元、海軍一九○·○○○·○○○元、外匯損失八○·○○○·○○○元、共計國用達二·一一二·○○○·○○○元、目前日本之經濟狀况、旣未便增稅、故擬發行債劵八八一·○○○·○○○元、比較上年所募之公債減少一三一·○○○·○○○元云（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>床次當先鞭撻政府（東京）本日午後二時三十三分、高橋藏相演說竣事之際、政友會之床次竹二郎卽於喝彩聲中登壇、於出其質問之第一矢、意在對政府予以鞭撻的警告、其大要如左、現内閣自成立以來、於兹一年有半、以其間之政績觀之、固不免種種討論之餘地、但處此國家多故之秋、在大體上不得不認爲經過許多難關、其次則關於外交·財政·經濟、產業等等方面、將政府之施政内容加以通盤之檢討、尤以外交關係意在維護廣田主張、並祝其成功、最後乃論及議會政治與鞭撻政府之意見如下、倘政黨能舉其更生改善之實、則議會政治之眞面目必能發見、至於現内閣之施政方針、並無確立情形、其對時局之熱誠與氣魄、尚嫌缺乏、且以有機物之一、而未能發揮其機能、吾人抱此感想者實居多數、艉成爲政局不安人心動摇之主因、對於此點、務望首相特别留意、發揮其大無畏之精神、實行其抱負、而達到勇斷果决之手腕、蓋齋藤内閣旣根據此項信念而成立、則關於國策必有以披瀝於國民之前、此則爲吾人認爲必要之點、政府對之其意志若何、務請明白答覆爲盼云云、</p>
<p>首相答辯一味敷衍（東京）齋藤首相起而答辯曰、「承促注意、至爲感謝、政府所述施政方針、卽爲將來實行之凖備、床次君所述、本人全部贊成、</p>
<p>東武質問農村問題　次由政友會之東武氏登壇、對於農村問題、尤以米榖統制法爲中心、質問「政府有無行使米榖專賣之勇氣」、又謂「爲國防而閑却農村問題、實爲遺憾」云云、</p>
<p>後藤農相對於東武氏之質問、答辯曰、「本年則爲豐收計、對於實施米榖統制法、尚須略加酌量、但無改正之意趨」、</p>
<p>永井拓相亦有所答辯、東武氏再行質問、五時二十四分散會、</p>
<p>新任陸相出席貴院本日貴衆兩院、新任陸相林大將均經出席、並在貴族院作簡單之答辯、因其爲初次發言、頗惹起滿塲注目云、（二十三日日聯電）</p>

<p>京城　朝鮮軍息、本月廿二日下午十一時半、遼東義軍三百名渡鴨綠江、侵入韓境平安北道某地點、攻擊守備國境之日軍、日軍被破、至大隊援軍到時、義軍已得槍彈退回原地、（二十三日華聯電）</p>
<h3>尼泊爾大地震</h3>
<p>死傷數千人火車仍未開</p>
<p>喀爾喀特　尼泊爾最近地震損失之程度、今漸明瞭、現恐人民死傷者當有數千人、三大城如加特曼圖、波特岡、與巴坦、房屋倒坍者甚夥、尼泊爾之政府鐵路亦大受損、火車至今未開、（二十二路透電）</p>
<h3>換湯不換藥林銑十郎就陸相職</h3>
<p>喚起齋藤實注意兩點决貫澈從來强硬方針</p>
<p>（東京）日陸軍敎育總監林銑十郎大將、今晨九時晋宮、在齋藤首相侍立之下、受任陸軍大臣之職、林大將就職後、對日記者團發表談話云、荒木陸相在職中所計劃之事、本人將傾全力使其一切計劃實現、爲就陸相職之使命云、（二十三日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）林新陸相允就陸相之際、雖對齋藤首相未附别項條件、然關於下列二點、曾喚起首相之注意、（一）荒木前陸相所提倡之事、均根據陸軍部内之總意而爲之者、余亦决全部繼承、謀其實現、請首相預先銘記此點、（一）據聞現内閣於對内對外兩政策均有不澈底之嫌、然一九三五年之危機迫在目前、殊爲遺憾、望對此點更加留意、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<h3>少壯軍人一致擁護</h3>
<p>（東京）林大將就任新陸相後之陸軍動向、似將踏襲荒木前陸相之根本方針、卽陸軍更選、除三月乃至八月之定期異動外、槪不舉行、林新陸相與荒木前陸相同樣、有淸廉潔白公平無私之性格、且有荒木前陸相所缺之决斷力、少壯將校之信賴漸有增加之勢、故軍部之態度、並不因荒木陸相之辭職而和緩、其强硬方針當依然不變、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>日新陸相林銑十郎</p>
<h3>刷新軍部第一新猷</h3>
<p>（東京）陸相更選後之陸軍部次官局長等之改任問題、因現在議會開會中、不致立卽實現、且林新陸相與荒木大將·眞崎新敎育總監等、關於非常時局國策實施問題之意見、從來已經一致、陸軍省之各項方針亦抱同一意見、故林陸相似承繼荒木大將之方針、但刷新陸軍人事問題、林陸相必定實行其靈活手段也、（二十三日日聯電）</p>
<h3>影響政局兩種觀察</h3>
<p>一說從此郭淸國内不安空氣</p>
<p>一說政府軍部益增衝突危機</p>
<p>（東京）關於陸相更迭、綜合政民兩黨及貴院方面之意見、有謂議會關係對荒木前陸相之言動、本有相當反感、關於軍紀問題預算問題、凖備深刻追求、此次忽更迭陸相、此項凖備已有的外目之感、故議會可更保持平穏、惟對軍部之動問與政局之將來、有下列悲樂兩說、持樂觀論者謂從來荒木陸相代表之一派、退處無權軍部之容啄政治、亦自不如前、故可一掃政局不安之空氣、持悲觀論者謂最近軍部内之急進分子、漸不支持陸相、而部内之要望漸移於林大將、就此事實觀之、今後此等急進分子之意思、可由林陸相表現其結果、政府與軍部衝突之危機將益增大、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<h3>戎馬書生眞崎繼任敎育總監</h3>
<p>荒木改任軍事參議官</p>
<p>（東京）本日上午在宮中鳳凰間、舉行林新陸相親任式後、同時繼續舉行眞崎大將之敎育總監、及荒木大將之軍事參議官親補職、至眞崎大將雖似無髯童顔之鄉村先生、然非一介之武夫可比、與林陸相同爲五十九歲、與故武藤元帥同爲佐賀縣出身、極愛部下、可謂名敎育總監云、（二十三日電通電）</p>

<h3>英帝國海軍會議討論太平洋形勢</h3>
<p>遠東艦隊將領集新加坡籌備防禦領土安全計畫</p>
<p>新加坡　英帝國海軍會議今日在此開幕、極爲秘密、在日本廣田外相發表自衛宣言、及美國主張建造新軍艦一百二十艘後、空氣中充滿不定氣象、海軍陸軍及空軍代表曾於月初舉行重要豫備會議、今次會議將於英國遠東海軍政策上有遠大影響、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>新加坡　英帝國海軍界憂慮遠東方面領十之安全、遠東艦隊將領因於今日齊集新加坡、討論太平洋上日漸發展之險惡形勢、參加會議者、爲駐華艦隊總司令特萊友中將、東印度艦隊總司令那斯密士中將、澳洲艦隊總司令海德中將、及紐絲蘭艦隊指揮官華德生少將、兹悉會議决策完全不發表、軍界方面雖則照例否認其有若何意義、但今次爲遠東方面五年以來帝國會議之第一次、且適與世界海軍新競爭同其時期、一九二一年來、大規模之造艦、無如今日之甚者、據此間統計、在製造中者、有强大巡洋艦三十艘、巨型飛艦母艦四艦、驅逐艦及潛水艇數整隊、日本與美國佔競爭之前列、英國亦已依據華盛頓及倫敦條約所規定之噸數、儘量籌造其戰艦及巡洋艦、</p>
<p>據英海軍專家稱、太平洋最近發展正在造成一九二零年至一九二一年時之形勢、其時遂訂華盛頓條約以限制美日間加速度之海軍競爭、近自兩國實行「大海軍」計畫後、英人認爲當時之海軍競爭已露其重新抬頭之跡象、英國當前有兩大問題、故對此發展倍覺其重要、第一問題卽爲英日間方興未艾之劇烈商戰、已將昔日英日同盟之精神毁滅、第二問題卽爲一九三五年之海軍會議、日本已正式宣示其要求與英美平等之意嚮是也、</p>
<p>太平洋方面近頃之局勢早已引起澳洲之憂慮、卽在去年十月間、李昻士總理及其前任總理許士曾一再懇請重新研究帝國邊防計畫、許士曾稱、「世界各國中最易受敵者厥爲澳洲、蓋以其地與亞洲人口膨脹之某一國一過一航之隔、英已不復握海洋覇權、日已不復爲吾人之與國、吾澳必須自爲凖備」云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國海軍卽可稱覇世界</h3>
<p>造艦百二十一艘計劃</p>
<p>全部海軍予以現代化</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日海軍預算審查委員會已將海軍部二萬九千三百八十三萬三千零四十元之預算案批准、呈送衆院、因此羅總統之世界最强海軍計劃、卽可實現、同時參院亦正在討論衆議員文生氏之提案、按文生氏提案、係欲將美海軍按照海軍會議限額、儘量造艦、現在海軍部預算擬以一百八十萬元造八吋口徑大砲巡洋艦一艘、及六吋口徑大砲之巡洋艦三艘、此四艘於明年一月造成後、美國海軍適成華府及倫敦海軍會議簽定之五五三比例、預算案内擬添招海軍士兵一千八百人、使美海軍總額成爲八萬一千五百人、並擬添官長六十三人、及海軍陸戰隊一萬六千人、預算案内並擬撥欵添置海軍用飛機一百四十二架、其中大多數爲水面飛機、而美陸軍新近以七百五十萬元所購之戰鬭機一百架、則完全爲陸軍所用、不能劃入海軍預算之内、此項預算數額、較海軍部常年費用少二千三百二十二萬一千五百三十三元、而較預算估計亦少一百五十八萬五千一百四十八元、本屆預算添置新船及修理等費爲數頗爲不小云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日對客言及主張建造新軍艦一百二十艘、約需費六萬一千六百二十五萬元之文森議案、謂美國不能再爲世界他處之軍縮模範、文森議案渠極端贊成、白宮之所以贊助依約添造軍艦者、因料定現行海軍公約於一九三六年期滿時、日本必要求與英美有同樣大海軍也云、文森乃衆議院海軍委員會主席、現已應海軍部長之請、允卽設法使此案早日通過、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）二萬萬八千五百萬元之海軍預算案、衆院必將通過、已無疑問、政府擬更進一步、將衆院海軍委員會所提之五年海軍建築案予以承認、其經費爲三萬萬八千萬元、以五年分配、每年爲七千五百萬元、衆院海軍委員會主席文生、卽爲此項建築案之起草人、渠預料倫敦海軍條約期滿之時、日本必要求其海軍、與英美平等云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國海軍戰術總指揮史丹德雷少將今日批評衆院所審查海軍供應案、並詳言美國艦隊内容之黑暗、謂美國最新戰艦固宜加以新時代化、而其他戰艦之狀况、尤屬不能滿意、至於飛機母艦薩拉土加號與勒克辛墩號、則在物質上現已退化、驅逐艦情形亦復甚爲可慮、驅逐艦在戰時行其職務、能否有效、殊堪疑問、洛杉磯號飛船現已不復安全、不久或須拆毁云、海軍供應案需費二萬八千四百七十四萬七千元、其中三千三百六十一萬九千元將用以建造新艦、内有飛機母艦及巡艦四艘、海上空軍撥一千八百八十八萬元、其中六百十三萬一千元、用以增造新機、至於去年在海上失事之阿克隆號飛船、則不擬補造、（二十二路透）</p>

<p>南斯拉夫柴格勒勃　小恊約國會議今日午刻在此正式開幕、但昨日夜半、三關係國之外長曾開一次初步會議、至今晨三時始散、南斯拉夫駐奥公使亦已於今日抵此、彼之來此、雖自稱並無何種正式任務、但衆信彼之此行、實爲向會議報告意大利外次蘇維治訪問維也納之經過而來、蓋此次小恊約會議中奥國問題實屬最重要之一端也、並聞此次會議恐難有何種重要問題具體之决議、因歐洲時局近來尚多變動、故祗可將重要加以討論、而暫不加以處决也、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>自招商局委派伍大名·史幹·到倫敦後、舉行四海輪投標、結果、每艘造價、最廉須英金九萬鎊、與局定之價、相差二萬五千鎊、一艘卽需四十萬元、四輪便超過一百六十萬元、幾使建造江輪之價、亦無着落、本月已數次提出局務會議、討論、經各科主任、會議之下、以借欵關係、必須向英定造、不得到别國船塢建築、惟船價過巨、殊不經濟、乃一面呈部請示、一面由局决定、電令倫敦伍史二員、對於新船標價、暫勿簽訂、聽候續電知照、</p>
<h3>庚董來電催詢</h3>
<p>駐英庚欵董事會、對於投標造船、有權顧問、自伍史將造價電</p>
<p>達總局後、庚董會亦屢次函詢局中、是否卽行定造、劉鴻生以四輪標價、比額相距至四分之一、如果照此建築、則江輪三艘、將全部推翻、與原案出入極巨、故函復庚董會、四新船造價問題、尚須愼重考慮、一俟决定、再行建造、</p>
<h3>重行投標招建</h3>
<p>該局爲四海船造價問題、曾具報理事會與交通部、請予核示辦法、船務科又將倫敦寄到標紙、由趙周兩科長考核、詳細覈察之下、以英倫開來標單中、其船身長度、所列爲三百四十英尺、亦與局方擬定之尺度不符、故由局中另再詳開船身之大小噸量吃水等等、寄交駐英伍史二委、着令在英重行投標招建、務使適合預定數額、</p>
<h3>江輪先造兩艘</h3>
<p>庚欵餘資、照預算本來可多十四萬鎊、規定用於建造長江船三艘、已在滬上投標、擬由江南廠承造船壳、機件等則由英倫運來、今因四海輪造價超過預算、使三輪亦受影響、該局已呈交部請示辦法、兹已得到部中復電、關於在滬建造江輪、姑令與承造船塢接洽、先建兩艘、其應用機件材料、及四海輪、俟英國再度開標後、視其價格若干、而後籌措欵項、以塡補此不敷之數、故局内已决定、上海先進行訂造長江船兩艘、而江南船塢、亦派員到局接洽多次、恊商承造手續、</p>
<h3>太湖水利會發表浚淞計劃</h3>
<p>估計經費二百十四萬元</p>
<p>太湖流域水利委員會、爲建議請撥棉麥借欵、疏浚吳淞江以利商農等情、已誌前報、兹由新聲社探悉該會依據前太湖水利工程處·前江南水利局·上海浚浦局·實測圖表、及建設委員會召集之疏浚吳淞江之决定、發表計劃書如下、</p>
<h3>施工地段</h3>
<p>上游自瓜涇口至江河村、約十八里、此段河央寬在四十公尺以上、尚無過狹之處、惟河底有淤淺者、應將淺處挖深、使河底至少較吳淞江水手零點低○·八五公尺、下游自徐公港口東至梵王渡、約五十九里、此段最爲淺狹、民國以來、久欲浚治、迄未實行、此段非大舉疏浚不</p>
<p>可、且不能支節爲之、梵王渡以東至外白渡橋一段、其中淤塞之處須加治理者、則參用上海市港務局之估計、</p>
<h3>裁去灣曲</h3>
<p>吳淞江上游河寬槽深、類於河泊、雖有盤折之處、其間支港小河、上下溝通、偶逢盛漲、皆資分洩、故不必費大工以裁之、又自瓜涇進口四○至五○公尺間、河底淤高、雖在吳淞零點之上、然此處大溜已捨曲就經、由華翔港而出港寬均一百五十公尺、河底較吳淞零點低一·　至二·○公尺、故原河亦可聽之矣、惟下游野雞墩一段、盤曲最甚、淤積亦最易、應屆開浚皆籌議改道、輒以工顉費艱而止、今擬裁去野雞墩自安浪渡至張家渡一段、改開新河、長二千九百餘公尺、（參照前江南水利局意見）、寬四六公尺、平均深五·三九六尺、底寬一七·二公尺、計開</p>
<p>堅實土十七萬四千英方、（暫以十七萬爲凖）</p>
<h3>土方數目</h3>
<p>各段土方數目、均以英方實土爲凖、列表如下、瓜涇口至江河村、一二·九一三·○方、徐公港至安浪渡、三九一·四九四·○方、（除安浪渡至張家渡一段）張家渡至梵王渡一二○·四○四·○方、梵王渡至新閘橋一二二·五○○·○方、新閘橋至外白渡橋五六·二二○·○方、（上海浚浦局曾在梵王渡至外白渡橋一段、完成工程一部、此項土方、將來施工時、應除去、）合計七零三·五三○·○方、新開河土方、共十七萬方估計在水中位以上土方約估全數百分之五十四、中水位以下、約佔全數百分之四十六、</p>
<h3>疏浚方法</h3>
<p>查疏浚工程、不外用人工及機船開挖二法、惟查歷屆用人工辦理、費時輒須數月、交通斷絶、農商受損、且本河支流密布、估計大小壩工、在一百數十處以上、築壩屏水、工斜費用、爲數甚鉅、除安派渡一段裁灣工程用人工開挖外、自以一律採用機船開浚、較爲相宜、且可分年舉辦籌費可以從容實爲一舉兩得之計、</p>
<h3>經費預算</h3>
<p>全部土方、除截灣取直工程外、約爲實土七十萬英方、卽帶水方一百零五萬英方、擬分六年施工、每年應挖土十七萬方、每年除修理及其他原因停工外、工作時間、以二百五十計、每日需出土七百方今擬購大號挖泥機船一艘、小號挖泥機船兩艘、使出土總量、能於六年内竣工爲度、兹將疏後工程全部經費預算、及分年應南經費預算、列表如左、（一）土方共價一·五一五·四六○元、第一年經費二一五·四六○兩、第二年至第六年、每年經費二六○·○○○元、（二）收用土地、共價六六·七五○元、第　年經費六六·七五○、（截灣取直及拓寬河面需收民地約如上數）（三）挖泥機船大小三艘、共價三一○·○○○元、（四）拖船二艘共價五○·○○○元、（五）機廠及施備共價一○·○○○元、（六）行政費六年共價一二○·○○○元、（七）預備費共價六七·七九○元、總計二·一四○·○○○元、</p>
<h3>會德豐駁船工人全體罷工</h3>
<p>發生衝突毆傷多名</p>
<p>會德豐拖駁公司、自去年一度發生罷工風潮後、兹又因該公司斥革工人一名、激成全體罷工、又因公司方面、派接替工人、前往工作、更激起重大衝突、毆傷多人、未知能早日了結否、</p>
<h3>斥革工人</h3>
<p>會德豐自與茂泰合作、駁船甚多、雇用工人亦夥、平時管理頗嚴、前日下午五時許、有一小火輪中生火工人、名設莘耕者、前日與同事工人、發生衝突、而致動手毆打、事後、爲經理西人維格羅所知、將殷斥革、補用陳阿二一名、前往接着、殷莘耕乃到駁連工會報告、</p>
<h3>釀成罷工</h3>
<p>查會德豐人有拖駁及小輪等一百零二艘、雇用工人、數逾五百餘人、組織一駁運公會、凡屬工人均須入會、殷莘耕被革、新工人陳阿二往代之時、各工人以公司斥退工人、未向工會知照、陳阿二且非該會會員、卽使添雇新工、亦應儘先雇用會員、各工人對陳阿二絶對不予同意、並要求公司收回斥換殷莘耕成命、公司不允所請、故全體工人、自昨日起、一致罷工、風潮擴大、</p>
<h3>交涉經過</h3>
<p>工人方面、已經提出要求、向會德豐總理維格羅交涉、公司當局、須切實履行保障工人生活條件、凡公司添雇新工、應由工會同意且復儘先用工會會員、總理維格羅拒絶工人請求、致告决裂、昨日上午十一時、總工會·市黨部·等曾出任調解、當派代表沈桴（總工會）·黃體人·（市黨部）至駁運工會·及會德豐公司·勸解、無如</p>
<p>維格羅態度堅决、未有結果、</p>
<h3>發生衝突</h3>
<p>昨日、各駁船工人全部罷工、無法工作、公司方面、乃由總理維格羅派出預備工人十餘名、前往各駁船工作、而維格羅更向各工人表示、如果於昨日午後不復工者、公司决改派新工、全體工人、對此事已團結一致、拒絶新工上駁、昨晚八時許、新工人十餘名、奉派前往各駁船工作時、被全體工人包團毆打、新工人中有金和尚者、足部受重傷、幸得逃出、已到同仁醫</p>
<p>院求治、其餘不能脫出而被毆受傷者甚</p>
<p>多、現該風潮更趨惡化、公司方面對此亦不允退讓、已報告捕房、將受傷者車送醫院醫治、而各輪公司過駁之貨件、因而受罷工阻滯者、均不能上船、客家損失極大</p>
<h3>受傷名單</h3>

<p>關於實業部籌設國營鋼鐵廠問題、自實長陳公博與德商喜望第三公司代表等、在京數度洽商、已得結果、兹誌其各情如次、</p>
<h3>廠址决定</h3>
<p>實業部以鐵與煤爲舉辦鋼鐵廠之主要條件、與將來廠務之興衰、關係至鉅、故在計議籌設鋼鐵廠之前、曾分派專家、赴各地調查鐵鑛與煤產槪况、經二年之研究、認揚子江流域、鐵煤藴藏甚富、且交通便利、故此次在京與德商喜望第三公司代表洽商後、决定廠址設在當塗附近之馬鞍山、煤則决以江西萍鄉之高坑煤鑛、先行開採應用、</p>
<h3>鐵煤調查</h3>
<p>實業部於國營鋼鐵廠地址等决定後、現已着手種種事務之進行、預料五六月間、該廠一部份工作、可以開辦、該部最近爲明瞭全國鐵煤藴藏數量、將再派員分赴各省、實地調查、據前外人調查我國鐵煤藏量、爲鐵共七六六·八九九·○○○噸、（其中遼寗占三○七·五八○·○○○噸）煤共九九七·六○四·○○○·○○○·噸、但信全國藴藏之富、必兩陪於此、因前外人所調查者、僅及華北及西北一帶、而西南各省、則未列入也、</p>

<h3>市公用局完成浦東水廠計劃</h3>
<p>廠址水源已勘定洋涇區游龍碼頭</p>
<p>全部經費三十萬由官商投資合作</p>
<p>本年内可興築約一年後實行出水</p>
<p>浦東籌設自來水廠、經市當局於十八年間、已開始籌劃設計、積極進行、全部計劃、業由市公用局設計完成、已購定浦東英美烟公司附近地百餘畝、並勘定游龍碼頭浦江爲自來水水源、全部經費三十萬元、日内會議卽可决定、一俟决定開建日期、預定一年後卽可出水供應、申時社記者昨特趨訪公用局第二科陳科長詢以籌備計劃經過、及進行現狀、各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>設計經過</h3>
<p>按市當局計劃在浦東建設自來水廠、開始於民國十八年間、因當時浦東市面、漸趨繁榮、居民日增、而所有河道、大多均屬淤塞、居民飲水、殊不潔凈、旣有害於民衆健康、且偶値火警、消防上無自來水之設備、動輙燎原、當地居民、曁衛生當局、均感覺有卽設立自來水廠之必要、經共同建議市府、當時市長張岳軍、亦認爲浦東自來水之設立、確屬急需、當卽令先由財政局撥欵八萬元、交由市公用局積極籌備、</p>
<h3>購定廠址</h3>
<p>市公用局奉令後、當卽分頭辦理、但因廠址之尋覓、頗爲困難、因此項地點須兼顧環境、又需有較優之水源、而浦東洋涇區浦邊水源、類多混濁、不堪應用、最近始覓定浦西銅人碼頭斜對面、游龍碼頭一·　尚適合應用、同時在附近之太古棧及怡和棧中間、適得足供廠址之空地一方、約百餘畝、必要時、附近尚可擴充、建造水塔等建築物、頗足敷用、當以一萬數千元之代價購定、一方並與市輪渡管理處商妥、將游龍碼頭出讓、俾供開濬、以作水源之用、</p>
<h3>籌措經費</h3>
<p>至該自來水廠計劃之實現、第一期需三十萬元、除前已由張市長任内撥發八萬元、實行開工建築、尚需二十餘萬元、已撥發之八萬元、除購地設計耗去約二萬元外、餘六萬元、當「一二八」滬戰時、因市庫支絀、已由市財政局提回移作别用、以致卽待開工之水廠、不得不暫告停頓、現市當局應事實之需要、及浦東市民紳董等之請求、决定最短期内實行、且浦東現有洋商棧房工廠等之總捐、多有藉口市公用設備不週、實行抗捐不繳者、如水廠成立、該項稅欵可收回者、不下數萬元、而浦東市面、亦可因之更臻繁盛、地價稅之增收、以洋涇區四千畝計算、亦屬不貲、市當局對此間接亦不無小補、惟最近市府一時仍無此鉅額金錢、爲期早日撥欵開築計、近已由吳市長召集浦東紳士、及本市銀行界會議借欵辦法、並已推定姚慕蓮·蕢延芳·林康侯·潘志方·蔡增基·徐佩璜·等八人爲委員、日内卽召集會議、决定辦法、聞短期内、卽可望圓滿解决、開始動工、</p>
<h3>出水日期</h3>
<p>據主持籌備該廠之陳君語申時社記者、現該廠内部一切建築設備等計劃、業經設計繪圖完成、招標開築等手續、亦有凖備、對於機件選擇、水管路綫、訂購手續合同等、亦均擬就、現祇候經費部分解决、一方面卽可開濬水源、建造廠房、一方電外國購置機件、全部工程、最多一年、卽可完成云、</p>

<p>范艾生、年四十七歲、江陰人、家住嵩山路第三十一號、以經營顔料起家、積資鉅萬、在顔料商中頗佔地位、惟范儉約成性、故自奉甚儉、卽每日外出、亦僅備一包車而已、昨日下午七時四十五分時、范以有酬應、乃坐自備包車往汕頭路而去、詎車至汕頭路廣西路口時、道旁突然躍出四匪、兩匪徒手、兩匪持槍、將范車攔住去路、並威脅車夫停車、車夫無奈、祇得將車放下、四匪於是卽一同上前、將范挾住、禁止聲張、曳入預停路旁之公共租界照會第六五三九號黑牌汽車内、開足馬力、向前疾駛而去、時范之車夫眼見主人被綁、手足失措、又不敢聲張、恐危及主人生命、待匪車去遠、乃亟奔回家中報告、並投報老閘捕房、請求援助、捕房得報後、急派探捕前往出事地點、查勘一過、一面四出追緝、惟截至午夜十二時、尚無線索、同時匪車亦未查獲、因此捕房方面通知全市警政機關、請予恊助、</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖區統稅局發覺八萬餘舞弊案</h3>
<p>仿冒局長簽字私刻局長圖章</p>
<p>科員鄧大榮已拘送法院訊辦</p>
<p>大公社云、本市蘇浙皖區統稅局、於二十二年度年底結束稅欵時、突然發覺該局二等科員鄧大榮、冒刻局長圖章、向中央銀行騙支稅欵巨案、現已將鄧拘送法院、靜候法律制裁、大公社記者得訊、當赴成都路統稅局訪謁第一科長陳研因氏、探得該案經過、詳情如下、</p>
<h3>年終對賬發覺舞弊</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區統稅局下、設有管理所及查騐所、所收稅欵、管理所係直解稅務署、再將所解數目報局、查騐所稅欵、則逕由各地廠商直解中央銀行或中央分行、而以銀行收據繳所、由所報局、去年年底、該局向中央銀行對賬、因年終銀行收解繁忙、無暇詳核、故直至本年一月四日、始雙方核對淸楚、賬面收解數目、雖絲毫無誤、而於局方所發稅照、則須虧欠八萬四千三百二十一元二角一分、於是發覺其中必有弊病、乃不動聲色、回局密查、果查出二等科員鄧大榮、私刻圖章、冒簽支票、騙領稅欵情事、</p>
<h3>舉止闊綽引起疑竇</h3>
<p>鄧大榮爲江西人、任該局二等科員、迄今約二年、在出納科辦理解欵文書事務、平常行爲闊綽、揮霍浩繁、該局秘書科長之薪水、高出於鄧者、反均無鄧某氣槪、該局局長汪宗沫已覺可疑、乃於去年十二月中、調秘書陳研因爲第一科長、囑其調查賬目、注意弊端、因有年終向中央銀行對賬之舉、否則該局與中央往來、祇須月結數目相符、斷無詳細對賬之事也、又鄧於年底時、因病請假赴粤、更令局中人對鄧懷疑、</p>
<h3>銷假回來拘解法院</h3>
<p>鄧大榮雖爲江西人、但其家則在粤中、去年年底、鄧突然因病請假返粤、初約本年四日返滬、嗣又函知六日返滬、此時局方已發覺鄧有舞弊情事、故鄧於六日由粤抵滬時、局中高級職員均至碼頭迎候、比及鄧上岸、卽邀彼赴外灘稅務署晤局長、（因汪局長兼代稅務署長之職、故在稅署、）當向其嚴訽一切、鄧初不承認、繼示以中央銀行冒簽之支票、始俯首無詞、當卽將鄧送交市公安局發押、由局轉解法院鞫訊、已由檢察官開過偵查庭一次、</p>
<h3>冒領方法神秘巧妙</h3>
<p>該局出納科之支欵方法、向來由出納科長於支票上繕就應支數目、呈請汪局長親自簽字蓋章、方可向中央銀行領欵、鄧本爲出納科辦理解欵文書事務、故有時亦由鄧代爲書寫、詎鄧已暗中留意局長之圖章及簽字式樣而爲作弊之用、其舞弊方法、係將稅欵留用、「譬如本月份、由杭州」</p>
<p>解局棉稅一萬元、水泥稅一萬元、火柴稅一萬元、共計爲三萬元、鄧卽將此項稅欵、用僞支票向中央銀行支取、而解欵文則暫時擱置不做、待下月份、再有他省稅欵解來、則將前項稅欵彌補、方將解欵文做出報解、」惟各省所解欵項、有時有幾角幾分、畸零之數、故鄧有時向銀行支欵、有時亦須將現金解進、以符合統稅局與中央銀行往來之數目、因此在月結時、雙方結賬數目</p>
<p>、絲毫無訛、一年來未被發覺者、卽爲此等移花接木技倆、至於鄧空白支票之來源、則在支票簿中請領支票單中舞弊、向銀行冒領而得也、</p>
<h3>搜查鄧寓略獲餘欵</h3>
<p>鄧大榮滬寓在福煦路康樂邨十九號、已由法院派司法警前往搜查、搜得鄧存在墾業銀行現欵一萬一千元、又其他業產數千元、其餘冒領之欵、則均已被鄧揮霍化用罄盡、至於廣東是否尚有他項財產、則現尚不得而知也、</p>
<h3>統稅局長自請處分</h3>
<p>最後據該局第一科長陳研因語大公社記者云、此事在發動之初、大都懷疑牽涉必衆、迨鄧大榮承認後、始知爲鄧一人舞弊、其他均無關係、至於中央銀行之失察、因與稅局同爲財部機關、此一筆損失、可以無分彼此、惟汪局長則因職務關係、已自動呈請失察處分云、</p>
<h3>女傭七人同中煤毒</h3>
<p>六人獲救一人氣絶</p>
<p>寓居法租界定煦路明德里七十二號門牌海軍測量局秘書福州人王莪曾家内、僱用女傭大吳·小吳·凌媽·陳媽·周媽·王媽·劉媽·七口、尚有男僕數人、均係安徽藉貫、晚間七女傭同睡在亭子間内、前晚（廿二）各女傭於臨睡時、因天氣寒冷、用洋鐵垃圾畚箕一只、將枯炭引火燃燒煤球、置放房間内取暖、各人於睡熟後皆被煤毒汽悶塞昏迷、至昨晨八點半、主人見各女傭均未起身、叩門呼之良久、房内寂無應聲、頓起疑　、乃由男僕劉福寳將房門撬開入内察看、滿室煤汽逼人、各女傭神志昏迷、呼吸奄奄、勢將垂斃、卽由僱主命急報告捕房、車送廣慈醫院施救、七女傭中除周媽（年卅左右）一人因受毒較深、救治無效、延至十時許氣絶身死外、餘皆獲救、得慶甦生、留院醫治、乃由醫院通知捕房、派探張春勝前往調查、並將屍體舁送同仁輔元分堂騐屍所、查得死者並無家屬在滬、候今日報請第二特區法院派員檢騐、</p>

<h3>揚子江水勢激退上下游航路截成四段</h3>
<p>長江綫至蕪湖駁運</p>
<p>湖南綫在新堤轉駁</p>
<p>本年長江水淺、爲勢甚捷、最初低落四五尺、嗣忽降落十數尺、至昨日下游水更退减一尺餘、而上江則銳降至五尺、滬上赴漢各江輪、較大之船、祇可裝四分之一之儎脚、而且上下游航道已截成兩叚、航行址分艱難、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>水勢又退　昨日各輪公司接得漢口電告、二十二日長江下游、水又銳减一尺餘、現時最高之處已從十一尺五寸降到十尺四寸、江渶關通告各船上水運貨、吃水不得超過十尺、而水勢並有續减之勢、在下游之太子磯·小孤山·一帶更爲淺涸、江輪上下、發生非常困難、</p>
<p>阻成兩叚　長江一路由上海至漢口著、到蕪湖已阻住、凡吃水十一尺之江輪、均不能通過該地、過去數日、由蕪被水淺擱阻者、已有六七輪、而昨日三北之松浦輪蕪、又因水落至十尺四寸、不能上駛、乃將船内貨物、就蕪用駁船過卸二千七百件、然後勉强通過、其他各公司江輪到蕪、亦皆過駁、又上游之長沙一路、昨日江水更落到五尺、漢口上行船祗可到城陵磯、便用小輪拖駁轉去、長沙下水貨、亦改駁到該地上輪、上下游航路、已分成四截行駛、</p>
<p>貨湧運遲　自二十日起、不諭上下江輪、除淺水船以外、其船身較大者、均遵照江漢關通告、减少儎脚、每一江輪在三千噸以上者、祗可裝二成半至三成貨件、致湖南漢口各地·積阻來貨甚多、各客家多擬在此三星期内趕到上海、故紛請各公司加派淺水輪、增添運貨量、招商局漢分局且請滬局調淺水海輪二艘、赴漢運貨、並請將快利改行滬漢、趕載客貨、</p>
<p>明日漲費　長江淺水費、由六公司議定、準自明日起開始、加收一成半、期限以三月十五日爲止、各輪公司因長江營業不振、水脚正在狂跌之時、淺水費已較上年遲收、惟聞各公司加收之成半淺水費、仍照平日運率、以五個九五折實收、</p>

<h3>舟車銜接便利交通</h3>
<p>該局前在吳淞鎭外馬路扞船碼頭舊址、建築之市渡輪碼頭、業已完工、原有駛航之三輪以不敷應用、故特加入此種寬大之五號新輪、俾增客貨之便利、所停各埠、均照舊例、每逢整點、由上海及吳淞開出、該輪可載客五六百人、且可裝載貨物、設備頗爲優美、聞滬太長途汽車公司亦擬將吳淞至寳山、乃吳淞至楊行之路線、展長至吳淞輪渡碼頭、俾與輪渡時間、瓦相銜接、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣訓練我們的頭腦（一）</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>讀了十三十四號貴攔内的文字，使我驚醒了不了，因爲我是「迷茫學海，不知所擇」和「連初級代數都不懂，就想研究愛因斯垣相對論」的人，所以偶然要學某項科目，結果不出「</p>
<p>科目太過專門研究」而退了，我買過許多的自然科學書藉，但因爲無相當的基本學識，所以終是白費了金錢，現在我提出個讀書的問題，請貴處賜覆我一信，</p>
<p>現在先把個性環境等等開下，以便對本人認識，</p>
<p>（一）個性｜｜我是個低能的人，喜低級趣味的思想，時常起一種無謂幻想和妄想，並且是粗心，懦怯，遲鈍，在學校的時候，對於數學成績常不及格，對於中英文背誦默寫却很好，對於運動不感興味，</p>
<p>（二）程度｜｜在舊制中學二年級退學就商，在校時對於數學完全不明瞭，出校後，因自勵的緣故竟將一本算術自習完（一半要歸功於答題詳解的）再想從事代數，但畢竟太難了，所以半途中止，遂從事自習英文，大有效騐，因爲自修完了李塔恩編的三民主義英文讀本後，對於英文報紙已稍有閱讀能力，因此繼續努力，現在對於密勒氏評論報及普通英文文學書籍等，祗須有字典在手，便能閱讀，對於易解的，常喜譯成中文，對納氏文法第四册甚感興味，因爲常和英文書籍相處的緣故，有了習慣性的對英文嗜好，</p>
<p>環境｜｜在一個鄉鎭上的店裏做司賬，月入十數元這裏對於英文毫無用處，而個性却反此，</p>
<p>希望｜｜因爲善於低級趣味的思想，經再三努力的改革，讀西洋文學名著及歷史名人傳等，已把低劣的思想漸漸地改去了，但是我希望養成一個有組織，嚴密，靈敏和健全的頭腦，我不敢有什麽野心，祗望有資格做一個認識時代的人，一個健全的公民和具有科學頭腦的人民，</p>
<p>我這裏請指導的是：　　（一）｜｜什麽學科會使我的腦力嚴密和健全靈敏和剷除無謂的空思妄想，</p>
<p>（二）｜｜邏輯是可以整理我們的思想，但没有學過代數幾何的人自己看得懂麽？</p>
<p>（三）｜｜學形式邏輯對呢或是辨證法邏輯好呢？</p>
<p>（四）｜｜要不要因爲恐怕「結果外國語並未精通，所欲讀的科目更無所得」而放棄英文而從事於他項急需的學科？（許樂眞來信）</p>
<p>代郵：一，姚天佑，石人君：請示通訊處，以便函覆，</p>

<h3>成敗論</h3>
<p>— 般舜</p>
<p>怎樣去成就我一件理想的事件，在乎我是否有堅强之意志與能力，當然，這似乎是「老生常談」何用我來喋喋？然而，倘然我們以哲學的眼光來觀察，那就尚有論討之餘地。</p>
<p>古人說得不錯；「精神一到，事無不成」，那末，這就所謂「成」了；同時有這麽一句；「驕者必敗」，這就所謂「敗」了！我們且看前者的所謂精神，卽是對某種事件的一種「素養」，用這一種素養來聚精會神去幹，無疑地何事不成。然而在這說法之下，如果没有素養，不能够像老僧入定般鎭靜，那末縱然他精神會聚，亦必四溢；没有素養而氣必四溢，眞就是說明年靑和尚難證菩提一樣，不容易成功偉大的事業，何等可惜。同時，溢的一個字，也就是表示「示於外」的意思，示於外卽是驕，驕是氣之外溢，上海人所謂「勿到家」，那末事敗是必然的了。</p>
<p>所以，事業的成敗，全看人們的有無統一的精神，無論其幹什麽，只要是否「熱心」，他的成功與失敗，自不難判别。此地所謂「熱心」，通俗的說一句就是「專心致志」，也就是「精神統一」的意義；精神之統一，在乎「故意的注意」的結果，此故意的注意爲我人所必備，也就是一種堅忍，有堅忍始有天才的表現，若自負天才，而無堅忍之意志，亦是徒然。尤其是血旺的年靑人，很多缺乏注意力的集注；否則，以不動不惑之自主力，不屈不撓之注意力，不存畏難，不存苟安，哼！哼！包你馬到功成。</p>
<p>所以在事年之「成敗」上論，精神之一到與統一，實爲偉大事業的必然過程，否則實難成功，爰作成敗論以徴諸同情者。</p>
<h3>懶</h3>
<p>— 黎民</p>
<p>咱們中國人從前也出過風頭，貢獻於文化上的功績，每個時代有每個時代的精神，所以自誇爲「天國」，是世界之王，其餘都是蠻夷戎狄，毫不足道的鳥邦：但是到了現在，反被外國人看得半文不値，這是甚麽緣故？</p>
<p>原來咱國人患了一種毛病，就是「懶」！</p>
<p>咱國人不喜管閒事，人人都是怕事，腦海裏深印着「多一事不如少一事」「自己只摕門前雪，莫管管他家瓦上霜」的惡觀念，這種「懶得管他人事」的不良心理，使國賊，軍閥，貪官，汚吏，土豪，劣紳横行不法，無惡不作，中國是患了一個不治的内病。</p>
<p>咱國人懶得和人來往，所以没有團結，好比一盤散沙，有人說：「積沙成塔」，但是沙裏没有「黏質」不能塔，好比人裏缺乏感情做不成事一樣；咱國人因爲缺乏這一點感情｜合作的精神｜所以没有大事業，更談不到發展。</p>
<p>咱國人得過且過，過了一天算兩個半天，這種懶心理，弄得没有創造力，看見人家的東西生意好，假冒牌子做一回，卽使被你混過了，試問我們自己的東西比了别人怎樣？咱國人會享樂，吃不來苦，懶得百樣做不來，不會造飛機，不會造火車，不會造槍械大砲，……去買人家丢掉了不要的來用，怎能和人家競爭，和人家作戰，，中國又怎能富强起來？</p>
<p>一件件的國恥迫來，寬宏大量，肚裏好撑船的咱國人，都懶得和人計較，可是，同胞們！難道等到火燒了眉睫，或是屎急屁來催了才知道不成。</p>
<h3>有閒階級</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>不願勞働而且可以不必勞働的人，就是所謂「有閒階級。」本來人們都旧惡勞好逸的，但是因爲饑寒的壓迫，却使得人們不得不絞着腦汁，流着血汗，以維持他們的生活。</p>
<p>在勞働圈外的「有閒階級，」是不會發生饑寒的恐慌的。他們有金錢可以解决一切的問題。他們的生活是太空閒了！所以他們不得不想出種種娛樂的方法，來消靡這些過剩的時間。</p>
<p>「未有安坐而能得食者。」書上雖然這樣明白的告訴，但是有些人目擊「有閒階級」不但可以安坐得食，並且可以安坐享受一切的樂趣（？）於是「不勞而獲」的心理便發生了！社會上種種的罪惡便也發生了！</p>
<p>勞働的人們太勞，有閒的人們太閒，這樣適形成一個反比例，這就是階級的鬭爭。最好人們都能變爲「有閒階級，」那麽舒適是舒適的了，可是一切的生產斷絶，這世界還能成個甚麽世界呢！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十三回　創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>這一天正午，他們屋頂，竪出了幾根木柱，有人在那裏搭棚。按着北京風俗，人家有婚喪壽慶的事情，一定在院子裏支架搭棚，爲着是在棚底下可以作臨時大禮堂，俗呌作辦事。對門人家一無人作壽，二無人生養小孩，三更不曾死人，這一定辦婚事。若要辦婚事，那自然，又是趙自强回家來，桂枝出嫁了。有了這樣一個徴兆，他每日出外來散步的次數，就更多了。到了次日早上，自己漱洗過了，好像有什麽人催促他一般，立刻跑到大門外來，向過門打量着。但是他不用怎樣的去深思，趙家大門上一片鮮紅耀目的東西，上面寫着有字，乃是「雀屏中目，鴻案齊眉」。大門框上面，也有一幅紅紙横額，乃是喜星高照。積之看到，情不自禁的，冷笑了一聲，那意思就是說，什麽是雀屏中目，根本人家心裏還有一個甘積之呢？至於鴻案齊眉，哼！我看就没有那樣一個日子。他趙自强一天不丢了槍桿子一天不能在家裏過那夫婦同居的生活。自己對那喜聯，暗中批評了一陣，却也不肯就走，且在自己大門洞子裏站定，看看别人家的熱閙。這時，有那專門趕人家辦事的茶水作的人，在趙家門口，擺上一隻其大如缸的茶壺爐子，一旁擺上五張紅漆雕花的茶桌，上面是玻璃架子，下面是印花桌圜，桌上擺下了幾百隻茶壺茶碗。這也是舊京一種奇特的風俗。人家有喜慶事，專門找這種人來司管茶水，普通人家，都把這種排塲，放在大門外。這雖說是免得在院子裏佔了地方，其實也是一種眩耀，好讓人家知道客多。（二九八）</p>
<h3>賣餛飩者</h3>
<p>— 楊</p>
<p>聽着遠遠的賣餛飩者托……托的敲聲。肚子裏便覺到餓，忙開了門等他的來臨。</p>
<p>時候，到底已是初冬了：晚上，十點鐘還没有到，街路就顯得異樣的凄凉，孤寂，除了夜粥店，因了自己生意的關係，還在這寒風中獨自撑着；餘外的一切店舖便都關得靜悄悄的了，從那邊的街道望到這邊的街道，簡直找不出一個影來，偶爾一個走過，那是縮着頭頸，面黃黃的，一望而知是從燕子窠裏出來的，西北風一陣緊一陣弛，怪氷冷的，吹上身來，不覺打了一個寒禁！</p>
<p>黯然的淡黃色的路燈光下，我看見他掮着擔子似乎怪沉重的，一步一步走來了！</p>
<p>經過了一度底的呼喚，他便把擔子歇下了，飽經風霜的臉上堆上笑勁問：　「先生，要多少隻？」聲音是不類本地的人，雖然學着，但聽去異樣的剌耳。　「三十隻够了！」隨手把碗遞給他。</p>
<p>於是，他闰始工作了，乘着這空閒的時間，好奇心的衝動，我便搭赸着問：　「你幹這個生意好多年了！」</p>
<p>「差不多已有四年了，回答着，一手便把餛飩放到鍋中。</p>
<p>「看你的口音不像本地人，那裏搬來的？」</p>
<p>這我是無意的問着，可是，却觸起了這壯年人的傷痕，嘆了一口氣：　　「唉：先生，你不知道哪！咱的故鄉原在江西，就是給共產黨打完了呀！妻散子亡，孤另另才流落到此地，這個賣買，從黃昏到深更半夜，不是人幹的！愈說愈氣急，差點兒没掉下淚來。</p>
<p>聽了他這一席話，我用什麽方法來安慰他呢？</p>
<p>當他把餛飩煮好：遞給了我，挑着擔子就走了哪！我呆呆的立着，眼瞧着這流浪者的影子漸次的消滅在燈光底下：心中覺到萬分的惆悵，願上帝永遠保佑這個孤獨者安好！</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— 陳東林</p>
<h3>脚的出喪</h3>
<p>匈牙利首都普達匹斯特有一位呌做馬律斯鐵亞蒙的男子，最近舉行了奇妙的脚的出喪。他的右脚因爲患了一種中風之症，所以他遵從了醫生的話，開刀把它切斷了。但是據猶太宗敎的習慣，「四肢五體之任何部分，發生意外而絶命時，應埋葬之。」因此他依了道鐵則將那條脚放在棺材裏面，舉行了大出喪，並且在牧師的悲傷的祈禱中，埋葬在土中。聽說此人在埋葬時曾大聲痛號了一陣。這可以說是世界最稀奇的出喪了。</p>
<h3>保持處女的原價</h3>
<p>菲洲斯登地方最近爲了賣買式的結婚發生了很大的騷動。按該地的風俗，要買一位新娘需牛十五頭，但是因爲最近的不量氣，非資產階級平常人是誰也拿不出十五頭牛的。斯登地方政府有鑒於此，欲使結婚「大衆化」起見，實行了新娘减價的「社會政策」。這麽一來，斯登的娘子軍竟大發雷霆，到處粘上，「保持處女的原價」，「絶對反對减價」，「政府應總辭職」，等等的標語，並且舉行大示威運動啦，還要開什麽全國處女大會啦，閙得不亦樂乎，一方面，普羅靑年們都發起了猛烈的反對運動，以至與娘子軍時有流血事件的發生。聞政府目下尚在考慮中云。</p>
<h3>上帝的住址</h3>
<p>七年以前，德國李潑特地方有一個好奇的人，寄出了一封信，信封寫着「上帝」字樣。該地的郵政局曾將那封信轉寄羅馬，希臘，巴斯丁等各地，但是該信最近郤退回了寄信人的地方。信上粘着的紙條上寫着，「收信人不明」！無神論者聽見這事都不覺大喜。而那封附着紙條的信，被一位富翁用五百馬克買去了。</p>
<h3>百年大計</h3>
<p>安哥拉的政府最近决議任重官者與他國婦女結婚將免職，但是在該法令的條文上却註着：「如該他國婦女係富裕者，則可默認之」。這可以說是安哥拉政府的幽默。</p>
<h3>没有病菌之島</h3>
<p>據最近自北冰洋之脫利斯登，特，肯哈島探險歸倫敦的斯賓頓博士的談話，該島雖然只有一百五十人的居民，然而該島一直到現在從未有過病人，因此連一個醫生也没有。</p>
<h3>製音博士</h3>
<p>最近美國出現了一位很珍奇的學士，曰Ｃ·Ｓ·Ｅ·Ｅ·。調查的結果才知道這就是：Ｄoctor　of　Soumd　Effect　Engineering的縮寫。意思是製音學的製音博士。他的本領就是在播音台前用樂器或其他物件發出火車，脚步，瀑布，雨，波浪等的聲音和動物以及鬼的呌聲。聽說這製音博士還是世界最初有的學位云。</p>
<h3>奇怪的紀念像</h3>
<p>莫斯哥某大公園中最近建立了一座很奇特的紀念像。從正面看是馬克斯，從右側面看是史丹林，如從左側面看却是列寗！這用意無非是想把蘇聯的三大建國偉人，機械式的安置之，使之合而爲一罷了！</p>

<p>華人籃球、在西靑年中、有每况愈下、不堪競爭之慨、於是光顧者寥寥無幾、甚至門可羅雀、昨晚海賊麥令之决賽、則頗吸引不少之中華仕女往觀、爭先恐後、西人之旁觀、當然亦不少、西靑籃球房、上下遂告客滿、爲西靑籃球男子比賽良華對海賊後之第一次盛况、比賽不能稱特殊的好、當然也不能說壞、海賊之得勝、爲應有之結果、處處較麥令高明、其衛守</p>
<p>之嚴密、眞如銅牆鐵壁、無絲毫隙孔可入、得勝亦在此處、而遠射之凖確、麥令亦當自嘆不如也、麥令經騐上之究竟不如、又乙組决賽新陽勝明强五六比二七、</p>
<p>上海籃球會甲組已定二十七日開始、將來兩隊二次相逢、且再看誰高誰下、深望有一堅强卓越之華人隊、起而擊敗之、以揚眉吐氣、</p>
<h3>麥令失敗原因</h3>
<p>事前咸謂麥令本年可以擊敗海賊稱覇矣、結果竟大出意外、失敗之第一原因、當然守衛不如海賊遠甚、而在此敵方嚴密監視之下、仍然向籃下進攻、於是處處碰壁、入後亦略試數次遠射、亦失於不準、中鋒長人洛克、被海賊長人萊茵看守、毫無一綫生路、從未擲中一次、各個之種種技術上、以較海賊之老於此道、亦相形不如也、</p>
<h3>海賊表演一斑</h3>
<p>海賊之表演、以衡麥令、優勝不少、大部份之時間、球在麥令籃前、卡爾生居中、史密斯史規亞兩邊夾擊、長人及匹雷在後、此法屢施見效、卡爾生在人叢中之回馬一槍、射中不少、美妙可觀、史規亞之無孔不入、尤嘆觀止、威風絲毫不减、長人在籃下接落下之球、無一次失着、惜乎史密斯之射籃、大爲减色、否則海賊早操勝算矣、</p>
<h3>麥令緊緊追隨</h3>
<p>海賊史規亞首先得中一球、二分開紀錄、别雪潑一罰一中、三比二居上、兩方皆謹愼非常、海賊以六比四再度超前、復以被罰之多、麥令二次以八比七超出、卡爾生之一中、海賊從此屈服麥令、一路佔先、十六比九後、麥令再下死力、上半時追成十六比十五、海賊僅僅多一分</p>
<h3>海賊終於得勝</h3>
<p>下半時相持五六分鐘、海賊仍只能多一分、且一度能二十一之平乎、二十五比二十一</p>
<p>後、麥令追上二分、成二十五比二十三、不料從此麥令得分停止、海賊處處得手、一中再中、麥令心意慌亂、忙於調將遣兵、知其更不堪敵、三十一比二十三、别雪潑罰出、麥令宣告絶望、終局比數爲三十六比二十五、</p>
<p>海賊擲罰犯分　麥令擲罰犯分</p>

<h3>新陽痛擊明强</h3>
<p>海賊與麥令之賽已畢、新陽對明强、繼作乙組第一次决賽、交綏之下、新陽先聲奪人、未幾卽以六對二、十對四佔先、明强努力迎戰、追成十對十後、賴葉全略之數度妙中、以十六對十二超出、新陽再接再厲、打成十八平手時、上半時卽告終、下半時新陽愈戰愈起勁、聯絡已佳、投籃亦凖、分數扶摇直上、明强望塵莫及、角逐至終、成五十六對二十七、新陽初戰</p>
<p>已勝、乙組鋪標、頗有染指之希望、</p>

<h3>說「沈默」</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>自發的沈默，中外一例地都視爲人生的美德。中國人說：「禍從口出！」所以金人要三緘其口。英國喀拉衣耳說：「沈默與玄秘！若這時代還是造神壇的時代，那神壇正還該獻造給牠們。」他又引着一句瑞士的金言「言語是銀的，沈默是金的」而改造過說：「言語是一時的，沈默是永久的。」比利時的那位神必時人梅泰林克（Ｍaeterlinck）在一本心貧者之實（Ｌe　Tresor　des　Humbles）的散文集裏，更把沈默，推崇得至高至上，無以復加。</p>
<p>他甚至說，言語的溝通靈魂，遠不如沈默的來得徹底。尤其是兩人相愛的時候，决定此愛者，乃是來至兩人間的最初的那一箇沈默。在遠道回家，别離在卽，大喜臨頭，生命終息，或大大的不幸，將次到來的一瞬間，沈默總在我們的先頭，所以人們在人數多的時候，最怕的也就是一一血箇沈默。沈默的嚴肅，就是愛和死和運命的嚴肅。</p>
<p>梅泰林克的贊美沈默，自然是有他的見地在的；但非自發的沈默，却未免有點兒難受。先讓我來說一箇故事；火德星君紀曉嵐，酷嗜淡巴菰，有一日正在吞雲吐霧，校修着四庫全書的時候，忽聽報說：『皇上來了！』他把烟斗向靴袋裏一塞，就怱忙地下去接駕。後來烟火燒上襪子，皮肉，乾焦氣都燻出外面來了，皇上問：『有什麽在燒？』他老人家却只裝着苦笑，鎭靜地回覆說：『没有什麽！』像這一種的沈默，可眞是應了法國人的說法，言語是隠秘思想的藝術（Ｓpeech　is　the　art　of　Concealing　Thought）了：但藝術雖然成了功，而皮肉可不免受了痛。</p>
<h3>談臉</h3>
<p>— 曄子</p>
<p>流傳在紹興民間的一個故事中說：包龍圖和狄靑是互易了頭顱的。原來包公本是天上的文曲星，狄靑是武曲星，他們同時下凡，扶持宋室江山。包公是要做文官的，本來該有一張小白臉，狄靑則是黑頭，恰像一個武將。但是包公下凡時，因爲怱遽，錯拿了狄靑的頭，以致狄靑也祇得將錯就錯地戴了包公的頭下凡。因此，後來狄靑出戰的時候，爲了要把相貌裝做威武，就得披頭散髮，並用一個銅面具遮住那張小白臉。而包公，則至今尚被呼爲「包黑頭」。</p>
<p>這一塲交易，給誰佔了便宜。很是難說。倘爲弚膀子起見，那末包公是要後悔的，但在事業上，小白臉對於狄靑非但並無好處，反而减損威風，可知狄靑是吃虧的。包公則不然。他之所以贏得「閻羅」的名聲，似乎得力於那個黑頭之處很不少，連笑容也博得「黃河淸」這樣的美名，可見一張難看的面孔在他實很値得。做一個「執法不阿」的硬官的人，似乎正合有那樣的頭臉。這樣說來，包公是佔了便宜的了。單是從不必戴假面具這一點說來，他也比狄靑舒服得多。所以我有點疑心，包公的拿錯頭顱，也許是故意的。</p>
<p>自從火器發明以後，打仗的方式大變了，今日的武將，大抵身居後方，用不到出頭露面，顯威風給敵人看。所以生着小白臉也無妨，斷乎用不到戴銅面具。而且有了一張小白臉，在博取女人的歡心一點上，是大有助益的。</p>
<h3>病中紀憶</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>病中想到一個地方去玩要，但是想來想去，終於没有一個可以玩耍的地方。像公園的草地上，是可以坐坐的，樹蔭道上，是可以走走的。然而没有錢賣門票進去，倒是小事；如果不穿着紳士那麽一套衣服，裝着紳士那麽一副嘴臉，進去了，反而是會增加病的。</p>
<p>於是，我只好坐在屋子裏瞑想，把過去生活史上最輝煌的片子，一幕一幕地獨自兒放演着。因爲，我覺得，這也應該是愉快自己的玩物吧？</p>
<p>於是，我就走進公園了。呵，一望的梅花，正散着淸芬。冬天的朝日，温温和和地笑在枝頭。露點和花影，沿着小徑，滴在我的衣上。愉快便從我的身上，飛舞出來。我忘記，我仍然是在這可咒咀的上海，身和心都已飛到雲天遠隔的第二故鄉｜雲南去了。</p>
<p>那時我正在昆明紅十字會裏當着雜役，整天整月，都在叱責，頤指氣使……那些重壓下面，喘不出一口自由的呼吸來。</p>
<p>大約因爲病了，才請得假吧？還是由於什麽呢？總之是得着一天的閒暇。一早便溜到南門外的公園去了，一面在朝日和煦中，梅花疏影中，興致勃勃地散着步，一面望着遠處　美的廣闊的藍天連聲低呼着：</p>
<p>「我自由了！我自由了！」</p>
<p>愉快和歡喜，像無形的胰子泡似的，從週身的細胞裏揮發出來，一朶朶地飛往枝頭，飛向草地，飛上藍天。</p>
<p>然，不久，熟人來了，我的主人們來了，｜他們不是紅十字會的會員，就是董事，總之，全是些城裏面最富的富人。</p>
<p>雖然他們並不說，做雜役的，你也來了麽？滾開吧。但我却馬上感到不安，感到煩燥，竟連呼吸也迫促起來。</p>
<p>於是，我低着頭逃出公園了。</p>
<p>一路沉痛地想着：生活尚未得着平等，自由是没有的。</p>
<p>美洲的黑奴，不是解放許多年了麽。但至今爲什麽他們還在呼號着呢。我明白了。</p>
<p>回憶到這裏，輝煌的影片，粉碎了，消失了。</p>
<p>没有梅花，没有朝日，一切生活都是黯淡的，不論過去和現在。</p>
<p>上床睡覺吧！在這病中的上海。</p>
<h3>畢業論文</h3>
<p>— 葉柴</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>｜｜多少錢？</p>
<p>｜｜五塊錢。</p>
<p>我摇了一摇頭：</p>
<p>｜｜五塊錢做一篇畢業論文，我可不幹。</p>
<p>｜｜馬馬虎虎吧，老李｜反正隨便你去胡亂凑一些就得了，祗要是一篇文章。</p>
<p>老胡皺了一皺眉頭，表示非常爲難似的說。我心中便稍爲活動了一點：　　｜｜那麽，要做多少字呢？</p>
<p>｜｜總得五六千字啦？</p>
<p>｜｜五六千字？</p>
<p>我向老胡釘了一眼。心中很生氣的呌了起來：</p>
<p>｜｜怎麽？五塊錢要做六千字！難道我的文章連一塊錢一千字都不値嗎？豈有此理！我不做…………</p>
<p>｜｜帮帮忙吧，老李！你横直閒着。</p>
<p>我，我，實在不會做｜……</p>
<p>老胡的樣子像要哭。</p>
<p>｜｜蠢東西！誰呌你來找我的呢！你又不是畢業生？</p>
<p>｜｜没有辦法啦。這，是，是……</p>
<p>｜｜誰的呀？</p>
<p>｜｜是，是｜｜</p>
<p>老胡不好意思的停了一下。接着：｜｜是密司王的呀！</p>
<p>｜｜哈哈！你這混帳東西？原來是你看上了密司王啊！也罷，我給你帮帮忙吧！明天吃午飯時你來拿好了。不過，你得先拿錢給我｜｜我的貨原是求現不賒的。</p>
<p>老胡欣然走後，我便連夜借了三四本論藝術的書來，東抄一段，西凑幾句，一直弄得天亮，才算把這篇偉大的畢業論文做完了。</p>
<p>正午，老胡跑來，看也不一看的就把文章拿了去。我於是買了些酒菜，在亭子間裏大吃大喝起來。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我正在做着夢，有人跑進我的亭子間中來了。</p>
<p>｜｜你爲什麽這樣早就睡了呢？</p>
<p>｜｜啊啊！密司王………</p>
<p>我倉皇失措的爬了起來，心中像作了賊給人家發現了一樣：「說不定是我那篇論文要不得，她跑來尋我退錢的吧。」我連忙滿臉笑容的迎了上去；</p>
<p>｜｜請坐！長日不見啦！……</p>
<p>我裝做非常鎭靜似的。</p>
<p>｜｜是呀！我眞忙哩。我，咳！咳！……囉！……</p>
<p>她從懷中摸出一束　頭來，向桌上一放。接着；</p>
<p>｜｜就是爲了這篇畢業論文啦！我眞忙死了，找了一個多星期的參考書，才把牠做完。現在請你給我………</p>
<p>｜｜啊啊！……</p>
<p>我險些没有笑掉牙齒。接着便恭恭敬敬的說：</p>
<p>｜｜不敢！不敢！那一定很好啦。</p>
<p>｜｜斧正，斧正！……</p>
<p>我於是把那個紙包兒打開來：</p>
<p>我胡縐的那篇東西經她抄寫了一遍。起首：不錯。看下去：不錯。掉了兩個字：不要緊。改了一句：唔！改糟了……馬馬虎虎。又改了一句：唔！……還是硬着心腸的看下去吧，終於……天啊！我怎麽也忍耐不住了：</p>
<p>｜｜密司王！好！好！不過，我覺得……我吃吃的說：</p>
<p>｜｜我覺得，這，這個地方……我看似乎……</p>
<p>｜｜噯！是呀！這個地方……</p>
<p>｜｜似乎有些不大接氣吧？……</p>
<p>｜｜噯！那麽！噯！……就請你……我連忙提着筆，照我的原文替她亂塗了一陣。她站在旁邊很不好意思似的：　｜｜謝謝你！我簡直是被參考書迷昏了啊！</p>

<h3>父女（五）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>「您没有想到您的女兒！」</p>
<p>她的眼睛注視着漠無一物的墻壁，她的語調像是對於這世界完全灰心了的老婦人的語調。</p>
<p>他仍然没有說話，有時候把手掌舉到眼前，像是獨自看着那上面的紋絡；可是他的眼淚水塡滿了，一點什麽也看不淸。他只知道坐在床邊的是自己的女兒，爲着自己可以說是犧牲了一生的女兒，她哭過了，爲着他而傷慘地哭過了。他知道自己是愛她的，她是那麽一個値得人愛的孩子。他也知道自己現在還是愛她，可是他却惹得她哭了。他明白這原因，没有話可以說，他願意女兒來責備他，甚至於來駡他，他都可以承受。他望見倒在地上的酒瓶，他的悔恨像整個的天壓到他的心上那麽使他苦悶。他想站起來用脚踢碎它們；可是他想到這没有一點用，所以他又忍下來。他的嘴在乾渴着，需要些水來潤一潤，他知道没有力氣站起來，也不能吩咐女兒，雖然知道她不會拒絶他的。他忍耐着，到忍不下去的時候，嘴就發出一種音響，用舌頭舐着自己的上顎。她看到了，站起身來，從櫉裏取出茶杯，拿起保煖瓶倒了滿滿的一杯。她走過來，送到他的手中；可是看着他那抖戰的手，没有交過去，便傍了椅子坐在地上，把茶杯送到他的嘴邊。他看了看她的臉，那還殘留着淚痕臉，就低下頭去飲着水。一口氣喝乾了一杯。她低低地問道：</p>
<p>「您還要麽？」</p>
<p>他把頭微微仰起些來摇着，可是他的眼角上，又嵌了兩顆大淚珠。她没有顧得放下手中的茶杯，就伏到他的身上哭起來。她的眼淚透過了他的衣服，熱熱地像是温暖了他的心，他用手撫抱了她的身軀。</p>
<p>「孩子｜｜你抱怨我｜｜是應該的。」</p>
<p>他費了很大的力量纔說出這一句話來，他還有許多話要說；可是像有什麽東西哽住了。他的喉嚨，再也說不出什麽來。他只能讓眼淚像水似地洗着自己的臉。</p>
<p>「你不知道這些天｜｜」他勉强地又說下去，「這些天我的心是多麽苦痛，｜｜那黑暗的影子撲在我的身上，｜｜只是使我傷愁着。昨天晚上，｜｜有那麽好的月亮，｜｜孩子，你不知道，｜｜」</p>
<p>他停了停，用手抹着臉上的眼淚。</p>
<p>「我和你的母親就是在這麽好的月光下說出了相互的情愛的，｜｜那月光眞好，｜｜在我親着她的上額的時節，｜｜我看得｜｜看得淸她一根根的頭髮。｜｜昨天晚上的月亮自然没有那樣好，｜｜可是我想到，｜｜這月光也在照着她的，｜｜於是我就高興起來。｜｜你懂麽，我的高興却引來了更大的憂鬱，｜｜我不知道她在那裏，｜｜我不知道她是不是也在想着我？｜｜」</p>
<p>他又頓住了，她知道這停止的原因，可是她却這樣問：「爸，您再喝點水好麽？」</p>
<p>他點點頭，但是等她捧來了一杯水時，却只喝了一口就要她放在一傍。她輕輕揉着眼睛，還是坐在他的身邊。他又繼續着說下去：　　「我知道她是不會想着我的｜｜她若想我就可以到我這裏來，｜｜可是我是愚笨的，許多人都這樣說我，｜｜你也許是這樣說我的，｜｜我却不能忘記她。｜｜昨天晚上我是更深沉地想着她，｜｜幾乎是不能卽刻見她的面就不能再活下去。｜｜我没有法子了，孩子，｜｜我就悄悄地取出你給我封留的酒。」他的聲音成爲乾枯的了。「我不是没有記着你，｜｜我記着我答應過你永遠再不使酒來沾我的嘴唇，｜｜可是對她的思念那樣殘害着我，｜｜我就不得不沉緬在酒中來忘記她，｜｜是這樣的，我是想來忘記她。｜｜可是，一瓶已經喝下之後，她的影子却更明顯地在我的腦中閃了出來，｜｜於是，我就又開了一瓶。｜｜這就使我醉了醉得什麽也不知道，｜｜我忘記了她，我什麽都忘記了。｜｜我像一個無恥的醉漢睡到地上來，｜｜這醜惡的樣子使我的愛女爲我痛哭，我只是一個愚人，｜｜我不配做你的父親！｜｜」</p>
<p>他到末了竟哭出聲來，頺然地又垂下頭去。他像是感到羞辱似地把臉藏在手裏，可是女兒却用温柔的語調盡情地勸解着他：「不必傷心了，爸，我只是擔心着您的健康。我知道您是愛我的，我不願意着您這樣子下去，｜｜」</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、本月期買賣、雖祇此兩三天、而雙方態度、仍非常鎭靜、毫無互相傾軋之風、數日來四十六號狂賣之結果、實與多頭不少之不利、而市面并不見摇動、足見多方實力可觀、鹽稅雖數度在五十元大關倐進倐出、盤旋不定、而昨日仍以四十九元九角五分收盤、又可見多頭之强硬、在此壁壘甚高、而又屆最後二日之際、一方稍有裂痕、卽足惹起波動、惟以廢曆年關已近、新交易漸漸减少、此層與債市漲跌、亦頗有關係也、昨日上午開盤、仍係掉期交易爲多、大户進出甚稀、裁兵以分頭掉期關係、遠期猛漲七角、餘亦好三四角、惟鹽稅則反小去一二角、此則因四十六號以前狂賣之原因、内部空頭减少、故有此漲跌不同軌之現象、人心因此尚未能與奮、次盤大都回小一二角、而鹽稅則又回好二角左右、趨勢乃見平衡、午後兩盤、雙方均有掉期惟不甚湧、比較以空方掉期爲多、市價乃每盤略好一二角左右、鹽稅兩次達五十元、而未能出關、但收盤祇跌五分、趨勢尚有穿出五十元之可能、市價結果、一致回漲二三角至六角半不等、成交總數、計共一千二百三十萬零五千元、現貨仍未有買賣、期貨統鹽稅共四百萬零五千元、裁兵佔一百九十二萬五千元、一九關善共一百零六萬五千元、二十捲二十關共二百三十六萬五千元、金短整六共二百二十二萬元、餘則數萬至二三十萬不等、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗絶無精彩</h3>
<p>棉紗市情、毫無精彩可言、升降甚微、形勢異常暗澹、因各方環境惡化、商業凋敝、紗銷一層、愈難起色、兼之廢歷年關將近、皆有結束之象、故市面更無變動矣、</p>

<h3>標花市態尚穏</h3>
<p>棉市平疲、但形勢尚堅、因買方心意觀高、近日受氣候冰凍影響、來源寥落、故市况較佳、但海外棉市趨向下游、印棉仍有續跌消息、而現棉需要沉悶、廠方紗無出路、對於原料進胃尤滯、就大勢論之、不脫盤旋之局、</p>

<h3>糧食　標粉徘徊瞻顧</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又回小二角零、坎拿大小一角零、故開價後、人心已見平軟、又以某小廠抽存本月份之多頭、因交害割日脚步近、陸續回出、市氣當然難擯、遠期則以客帮生意甚少市亦軟化、至下午各盤、交易又淸、多頭回出又少、市呈定局、觀目下實銷之淡、以及業外投機之不動、前途殊少奮發之望也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、二三月份小二厘半、四月份不動、五月份小七厘半、六月份不動云、</p>
<h3>期麥虛軟不堪</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初穏繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、續落一二角左右、初開時人心已見平定、迨後因有多頭回出、趨勢逐見不佳、至下午開價、本月份因交割已近、兼謡南市某糧食行擱淺、交易所籌碼、均有回出、因此市氣虛疲不堪、幸交易不旺、大跌不易耳、結果本月份較前日跌六分、三月份跌四分、四月份跌三分、餘無比較、</p>
<h3>晚稻回落五分</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源四十餘號、（六千餘包）市况初則平常、其後雪花微飄、人心始稍向上、惟店胃猶屬勉强、故各帮厚粳仍祇平定、杜尖亦無上落、僅洋尖貨乏較挺、各帮晚稻客帮包胃、雖有南北洋兩帮續辦一千五六百包、然究以客家懷抱迴異、致價回落三五分、且視趨勢似有起伏變幻之象、陰元酒户帮去路仍滯、市色續疲五色、變元獨樹一幟、緊俏異常、</p>
<p>（滬北）各地到貨十八九號、因内河凍斷未能流暢、故到貨稀少、各種銷路仍佳、包胃不動、市形白粳羊秈價加近角、白元去胃有濃、高貨加角許、中關加二角、次貨平定、埠杜尖·早薄稻·陰元·客尖挺勢、</p>
<h3>客秈閩銷復活</h3>
<p>湘贛貨到頭不絶</p>
<p>昨日客秈到頭略有、因閩變結束後、人心望好、行販已開始運辦、雖以年關在卽各方均求收束、惟湘贛當地米價亦低、販户活動、故日來湖南·江西逐有小票到申、市面熱閙、尚有途貨若干亦可在日内抵埠、惟貨主以閩　甚貪、閩省除省帮外、泉州·興化·厦門各帮亦將繼續問律、因此心思甚堅、行情扳俏、後市尚在望高中、昨閩省辦興甚濃、機元客秈各漲一角左右、本街與浙帮雖有胃口、因被閩帮放價、不敢暢辦、祗各辦湖南機油米二百餘包、閩帮亦去二百餘包、價六元九角至六元七角半、又紅糙四百五十四包、價五元八角、糙靖二百包、價伍元七角、無錫機元米三百包、價八元三角、蕪湖機元米二百九十八包、價七元五角半至七元四角八分、</p>
<h3>花生銷路獨見流暢</h3>
<p>昨雜糧市塲、交易寥落、實因天寒地凍、内地交易不接、出口及本街上市問津、市價無大出入、花生隨到隨銷、售價比較生仁高出元外、菉豆時令關係、走化見少、昨有厦門帮問訊百餘包、市居平態、黃豆高貨反較中次貨爲軟、此亦醖釀所不免耳、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白荷赤均轉升</h3>
<p>昨糖市以關金微升、趨勢續緊、公會划盤二四粗砂白普通貨划十九元四角、轉口貨六元五角半、均升一角、荷赤復見上升、高貨呌十六元、普通十五元八角、成交數十包、均升二角、下呌十五元五角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌十九元九角、ＤＹ嘜划十九元三角半、比前升角許、振裕一號白呌升二角、爲十八元八角、未成交、祝靑開出普通貨百餘包、價爲十元○八角、高貨十一元四角半、潮靑市勢轉呆、無續開、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲銷之轉機難</h3>
<p>去歲俄絲輸美激增　蘇俄近年來對於蠶桑事業積極發展、派員分赴日意等產絲國、採辦蠶種桑身、奬勵農民育蠶種桑、蠶絲產額與年俱增、其所產生絲、亦以美銷爲尾閭、去歲俄絲輸美激增、昨據本埠美絲商接得紐約絲業聯合會電報、去歲一年中俄絲輸美總額共達五千七百九十七包、（以基羅扯合）</p>
<p>廠經綢銷不寂　海外生絲市塲、近因機廠等减少出品、生絲銷用不增、更兼日絲舊價仍　、華絲廠銷依然呆滯、電轉沉寂、歐莊觀望、僅内地綢門進胃尚暢、市價雖漲起二十餘元、奈廠方仍須虧本、昨又成交黃白廠經五十包、法莊進灰經二十包、價仍堅挺、</p>

<h3>香烟的時代性</h3>
<p>— 非人</p>
<p>我每天從亭子間出來，到學校裏去出堂唱，經過一很熱閙的塲合，而在這塲合的中間，有一極大的墻壁，這墻壁，便是商店最適宜的廣告所在了。</p>
<p>我第一次發現該墻壁上的廣告，便是馬占山香烟，當時壁上所畫的，是一位民族英雄，躍馬揚旗，威風凛凛。這是救國抗日時期，足表見民族英雄的氣槪。未幾該廣告就不見了。</p>
<p>繼續在這塲合所發現的，便是蝴蝶牌香烟廣告，壁上所畫的是一位娉婷女子，婀娜多姿，一見令人有飄欲仙，魂雲兒飛去半天之概，顯然表示救國工作，業已完畢，這便是娛樂時期了，未幾該廣告又不見了。</p>
<p>應運而起的便是孟姜女的香烟廣告了，孟姜女萬里尋夫，不是歷史上最可憐可憫的一個女子麽？這分明表示樂極悲生的意思，我想到了這個時，大家也應該醒醒了，然而到這個時期，醒也已來不及了。</p>
<p>我看這三個廣告，確有連續性，很足以代表我國民三時期的態度。</p>
<p>啊！孟姜女，你的夫到底那一天可尋着呢。</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年的反躬自省</h3>
<p>— 秀</p>
<p>昨天（一月二十一日）早晨，展開了一份「年老報不老」的申報，使我觸目驚心的看到上面刋着：「去年對外貿易，入超四億一千餘萬元」，的一個使人痛心的統計。我想替外商對華貿易，造成這麽鉅大的一個出超者，不能不歸功於一般愛用洋貨的同胞，尤其是女界姊妹們的熱心推銷，不遺餘力！</p>
<p>但是在號稱「國貨年」的去年一年中，入超的數目，竟至如此之鉅，這未免太笑話了吧！我們這般平日對於「提倡國貨」高唱入雲的中國人，又何以自解呢？</p>
<p>我正在對着這張報紙，感慨係之的當兒，我們的小統計家雪梅來了，｜｜她曾把去年上海各戲院所映的新片，加以統計，總數四百二十七張，而外國片倒佔了三百五十五張，國產片只有七十三張，我們因她喜歡做這類的統計表，所以稱她爲小統計家｜｜，我指着這段入超的記載對她歎道：「請你這個統計家去統計一下，在這四億一千七百八十四萬八千九百元的入超之中，從我們手上金錢外溢的，究有多少？」</p>
<p>她含着苦笑答道：「自然是我們女同胞化去的佔着大多數，而造成這巨大的漏巵，推銷最力的，尤以摩登小姐首屈一指，除了身上的衣服，手上的寳石，鑽戒等貴重的裝飾品外，什麽絲襪，高跟鞋，以及香水脂粉等化妝費，亦很可觀。你不是聼蜜絲黃說過嗎？她爲了一點櫻唇，每年也要化了八十多塊錢，去買巴黎口紅哩！」</p>
<p>我聽了她這一番話，不禁有感於中的點頭道：「對了，非但那些奢侈豪華的太太小姐們，常以服用價値高貴的洋貨馬榮，便是我輩，也不免化了白花花的銀子去買洋貨，你看放在我們眼前的自來水筆，墨水缸，便是眞正道地的來路貨！唉！「往者不可諫，來者猶可追」，今年旣是婦女國貨年，我們以後便要格外的反躬自省，雖一針一綫之微，亦須購用國貨……」</p>
<p>她不等我說完，便立刻表示决心的站起道：「好！我們就這樣决心做去，縱不能驟然把這樣鉅大的入超，一變而爲出超，但無論如何，我們少買一塊錢的洋貨，便可多提倡了一塊錢的國貨，也就减少了一塊的入超，挽回了一塊錢的利權……」</p>
<p>我聽她激昂地說着，不禁拍手呌好，並且學了一句口號高喊着：「全國女同胞們，大家一致起來，在這「婦女國貨年，」努力的提倡國貨！儘量的服用國貨！」</p>
<h3>各有天地</h3>
<p>— 老牌</p>
<p>午後一時了，賣勁地從病榻上拖起暈迷而笨重的身軀。</p>
<p>下意識的走出衖堂。</p>
<p>風是那麽「虎虎」的刮着，凡地面有水滴的都凍結了冰，來來去去的人雖如平日般的多，但不像織梭似的那麽忙，可說個個是兩肩挾着頭像送葬的孝子，只是蠕蠕的動。</p>
<p>風是那麽「虎虎」的刮着，大家都怕冷啦。</p>
<p>這兒，却有着；</p>
<p>四個髒妹妹，假使她們若還高出點的話，那已够在四馬路市區的「街頭」「棧房」裏開始其賣笑賣肉的生涯了，端詳的望過去，面孔果也淸秀。欠缺的是各個少了一襲護體的衣服。但也並非赤裸着，有的披了蔴布袋，有的像紥着男式的破襖，有的則是穿的使人察辨不明的東西。……</p>
<p>四個都顫抖着。</p>
<p>却又，四個都歡樂着。</p>
<p>那麽「　囌」一回兒，就大家踢着　子。</p>
<p>轉一轉興頭，又輪流着跳繩。</p>
<p>笑容堆滿了每個的髒面孔，顯示出她們對生的喜悅，對現實生活的滿足，没有厭棄，也没有邪念。</p>
<p>但我想她們的生命是够尶𡯓了，實際上是不容許她們那麽喜悅。</p>
<p>爲着這，一時我竟找不出解答。</p>
<p>直到晚邊用飱的時候，鵬主張上館子去，我只願化兩毛錢買點牛肉回來自己燒，這一來，却把擱淺在心頭的問題，一息就解剖了。</p>
<p>原來自己也和那四個髒妹妹一樣｜｜一向表示對生的喜悅，對現實生活的滿足，没有厭棄，也没有邪念。</p>
<p>「做官」從没有想過，「發財」也從没有想過，所以小小的上海市究竟有多少「官位」，我很茫然，航空奬券發到了第幾期，我也不知道。我只曉得每日凖時的工作，吃飯，笑，……抽烟及其他。雖然有時候，也想找門適意的事幹幹，却也不急切的去鑽營，以爲了可度生，卽度過去好了，何必那麽忙，那麽認眞。</p>
<p>自然，這類的人還多呢，在四萬萬同胞中，不僅四個髒妹妹和我已也。</p>
<p>咱們古德的格言曰：「安分守己」，「樂天安命」，「富貴在天」，總之是「宿命論」，一切的一切，生活的排列，前途的否泰，都交給一個「命」字好了，不必多費思考，努力什麽。</p>
<p>這樣，當然大家都很規矩了，有人呌你坐下，你就坐下，說是坐下好。有人呌你站起，你就站起，又說站起更好。</p>
<p>至於「民族」與「社會」，曾否因此以致老無長進，那說來有些晦澀了，只有帶住不詳。</p>
<h3>談談啼笑因緣</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>啼笑因緣在新聞報快活林上逐日刋登的時候我没有看；啼笑因緣在本埠附刋上鼓掌喝采的時候我没有看；啼笑因緣在張石川和顧無爲鈎心鬭角的時候我没有看；啼笑因緣在王美玉一身兼飾兩角的時候我没有看，啼笑因緣在薛筱卿九朱耀祥舌劍唇槍的時候我没有看；啼笑因緣在三友書店懸賞冒印的時候我没有看；啼笑因緣在……没有看；然則你的啼笑因緣如何談起呢？（我亦欲問）　，來了，一九三四年陽歷元旦我返家去了兩天，在表妹的書架翻到了這部婦孺皆知的啼笑因緣。表妹最現任的大學生，許多堆滿着的巨本西書和社會科學書中啼笑因緣也佔着一席地位，我就將這部封面上畫着一個美麗的人頭的巨著在兩個失眠的晚上翻完了。然而牠給我影像是那樣模糊，所以我的談談啼笑因緣是再無聊不過的事。</p>
<p>啼笑因緣中的四個理想人物｜｜樊家樹，沈鳳喜　關秀姑，何麗娜，像唐伯虎，秋香一般容易的深印到奶奶小姐的腦筋中去。看慣了三笑，珍珠塔等老調，在一般小布爾喬亞追求新的逍這品的時候，啼笑因緣註着好命運在這時候應運產生，牠的一紙風行一如舉行冬季大减價般不足驚奇的。</p>
<p>樊家樹根本就是個小布爾喬亞的典型，他背井離鄉到這無風三尺土，雨後一街泥的古老底北京城來，爲的是求學，但是我讀到燭影雙雙的最末一頁，似乎没有一行字告訴我樊家樹是個求智識慾滿足的大學生，或者因爲牠給我的影像太糢糊，在我不留意的當兒溜過了我的眼球。啼笑因緣旣已再版三版的出書，在祷末許多的讀者之中，總有｜｜祗要是僅僅一個一字一句的讀一遍，大概這問題就可解决了。</p>
<p>自從樊家樹天橋驚艶，（西廂記中偷來的成句｜｜黛妮自註）遇關秀姑，遇何麗娜，他周旋在三個不同典型的女忹之中，我認爲一定如九美團圓般的來一個大喜劇的。然而沈鳳喜瘋了，關秀姑飄然隠去，我們這位小布爾喬亞的樊家樹，終於門當户對和何小姐配成了夫婦。作者在書後也聲明不能將三位美人都歸諸樊家樹，（恕我引不出書中的原句）這似乎出了我的意料之外。然崦讀者應知道，三笑中的秋香，根本是小姐的身份，况且將來是華太史的乾千金哩；所以配於堂堂一榜解元公的唐寅，等於樊家樹和何麗娜的百年好合都是順天行事的大結局。唱大鼓的和賣解的女兒終於翻不過這如來佛的手掌。這來，似乎又没有出於我們意料之外。</p>
<p>對於這四位主要人物，我不想再說什麽了，因爲我看書的時候太不仔細，而且現一時也没有現成的啼笑因緣在我手頭。</p>
<p>我的祖母讀了本李涵秋的鏡中人影，說他的筆鋒，「入木三分」。現在啼笑因緣也患了這通病，至少我認爲太理想化，雖然書本中的人物我們不必引證到我們的周遭來；但是我曾耳聞啼笑因緣確是現實的事件，那自然描寫的誇大性會失去眞實性的，因爲我在讀啼笑因緣的時候並没有體騐到牠是「現實的事件」。雖然我的現在的大學生表妹她說像讀玉梨魂時一樣的流了同情之淚。</p>
<p>再提到恨水先生寫每個人物的個性，都是那般堅强，現在他同時寫七八個長篇的時候，不知還保持固有的作風？我還可肯定他是個電影迷，他很能運用小動作，可是不像電影一樣，他往往畫蛇添足（是否可用這四個字？）的在小動作之後聲明這是「小動作」。在啼笑因緣全書中，我很想用Ｃut的手術掘牠幾條壕溝，你看最後還是排着加圈的鉛字滿足一位讀者的質問。我想如其每一位讀者有一封質問的信，啼笑因緣至少可以加多一倍篇幅。</p>
<p>在兩個失眠的晚上翻完的這部啼笑因緣巨著，再「談」不出什麽來了，所以我自認是再無聊不過的事：但是我希望别有比我更無聊的人，在讀了我的「談談啼笑因緣」之後。</p>
<p>最後應用老方法拖條尾巴：關壽峯夜探將軍府的一段，可作武俠小說讀。</p>

<h3>賣命</h3>
<p>— 綠蒂</p>
<p>在現今弱肉强吞的社會中，失業的呼聲像抬起頭來望見天一般的已不足爲奇。大學生過的是失眠年，做官先要送女兒。自然，幸能拍賣的結果而抓到一隻飯碗，非鞠躬盡瘁將自己縮短壽命，你的飯碗是時時在「沙蟹」的危險時間；所以絞賣自己腦汁的文人那能不自嘆呢！</p>
<p>這類殘酷的事實是天天在我們眼前連續的表演，祗要你稍稍注意你的周遭，不過最緊要的條件是你的飯碗也在懸案之中，否則，你對於這類的表演僅僅添加茶餘酒後的資料而已。</p>
<p>伶人孫德寳，演戲賣力送命，這幾個二號字跳進了我的眼球。孫德寳這位起碼的伶人，她没有梅蘭芳那般的「世界聞名」，她在天韻樓鳳儀班中唱戲，正如我們一輩起碼文人在報屁股上寫文章一樣。她不能在紅氈毯上出一個月風頭，休息這末一年半載，再被重金禮聘，重行「靜養數天，擇吉登臺。」她每天在「賣命」，藉低能的「身手」，博臺下觀衆的彩聲，所以就連試鷂子翻身，捧住那隻時時有「沙蟹」危險的飯碗；然而「運氣太久，氣閉倒地」，「賣命歸天」了。</p>
<p>筆者自己没有在這塲合「喝采」，不知化了兩毛錢去享受低級興趣的觀衆，歸府去捧上熱氣騰騰的夜飯時候有什麽感想？一塊弱肉被强者不費氣力的吞了，在所謂上海是很難聽到一二聲的喟然長嘆；然而絞盡自己腦力的文人怎能不嘆呢！哀哉，孫德寳！</p>

<h3>學習專門技能以避免失業</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個不幸的人，十五歲就進一家商店開始過着學徒生活。新敎育是一點没有受過，僅唸了六七年的子曰詩云。自從混入商界到現在已經有五年了。這五年中失業已有三次。在舊式中小商店裏做事或謀事差不多都要靠路子；有没有本領還是其次。就說本領罷，也不過是寫寫算算而已。這是最普通的技能，我想在失業的人們中，具有這種技能的人，定不在少數吧。所以我認爲我個人奮鬥的方法，是拚命地去求一種實在的專門學識，以克服惡劣的環境。現在日間是勉强可以求學的，但是發生了下面幾個問題：</p>
<p>（一）我今年是足十九歲了，所以希望在三四年内求得一種專門學識，但是我的程度除了國文可與初中同等及在夜校讀了半年英文算術懂得加减乘除外，其他是一點没有的，我有志於工業，但没有初中資格，進高等職業學校是不能够，工專更談不到，先生，有什麽方法指導我，使我在最短期間造成初中資格而去求我所欲求的學問嗎？</p>
<p>（二）學工業是需要較長底學期間的。倘因時期及經濟關係，不能達到我的志願，那我想只好學無綫電信吧，聽說上海有一個交通部立的什麽無綫電學校，該校是何名稱？在該校畢業後，交通部可否派往各電台工作或實習，請給我一個答覆。</p>
<p>（三）我所處的環境，在這封信裏你或者可以明瞭一半，假使我前面所說的辦法都不妥，先生，你可另外指示我一條生路嗎？</p>
<p>胡和中啓</p>
<p>編者按：足下所詢三點，兹答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）近來學校招生，頗注重資格，足下未受過學校敎育，似難入學。於「最短期間内造成初中資格」甚非易事，因足下旣有職業，决不能再入學校讀書，而相當於初中之補習學校，現尚未聞也。</p>
<p>（二）交通部立電信學校確有，聞分無綫有綫兩班。惟據說入學極嚴格，照足下之程度，投考甚爲困難。將來派事與否不詳。</p>
<p>（三）足下現擬求得專門學識以避免失業，此種主張亦未盡然，須知社會上之失業並非因失業者缺乏工作技能所致，乃是現社會所必然產生之現象，此點足下亦曾感覺到：知道失業的人並非是没有本領；但是足下以爲有了專門學識，就可以不愁失業，却也不見得。現在有專門工作技能的人，失業的仍是很多，因爲職業也和商品一樣，是由供需關係决定的；如果社會是蒸蒸向上，生產事業極發達，需要很多人來做事，那麽，有了工作技能的人，就可不愁失業，爲的是像這種有工作技能的人才很少，而社會上又需要這種人來做事。反之，如果社會上生產事業很不發達，那儘管你有天犬的本領也會一無辦法的，爲的是這時社會上並不感着「人材荒」，倒是人們覺得「職業荒」啊！所以，足下希望以獲得專門知識去解决職業問題，並非是一個很可靠的辦法，因爲在目前中國，缺乏「發展生產的其他物質條件」爲工業不能發展的主要原因，「具有生產技能人才之缺乏」還在其次，但是，從個人講，除了希望增進工作技能外，還有什麽辦法，雖則這不是一個可靠的辦法。照足下的情形，我們以爲暫時可不必抱什麽大的野心，去學什麽「專門技能」最好是老老實實的對於本國文字下些工夫，多讀點社會科學常識書籍，如果你筆下淸通，常識又豐富，那謀事或許要較便利些，因爲在社會上做事總以能寫寫普通應用文字爲前提，至於社會科學常識，則可帮助你了解現社會，知道你在現社會中所處的地位，如此，卽使你感覺到種種環境上的缺憾，也可不自「怨天尤人」，同時更可使你應付社會環境有一點把握，所以這兩種科目的學習，我們以爲，於你是不無裨益的。</p>

<h3>曼麗的自由（五）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>有一天，那是初秋之深夜，細雨絲絲地下着，他獨自一個人從酒館裏吃了爛醉出來，在馬路上被秋風一吹，酒湧上胸，湧上腦，他什麽知覺都失却，他下意識地在馬路上蹣跚。前面外國酒館那ＢＡＥ門口停下一部黃包車，一個外國水兵跳下來以後不給錢，黃包車夫追上向他要錢，那外國水兵伸脚就踢，黃包車夫倒在地下，人傑的醉眼中看見這種慘劇雖然是模糊，但他下意識地知道那是外國水兵在欺侮我們中國的窮人，他那北方人特有的豪俠之氣所謂路見不平的秉性，敎他立刻去打那外國水兵，並且用英語大駡他一頓。兩人都是吃醉了的，氣力誰都比平時大；兩人又都是下意識地明白，那外國水兵是駡着「你這黃皮猪的Ｃhinaman敢和我們動手」，他是駡着「你這外國的下流胚子，死後不能登天堂的劊子手，眼中無人，彼此駡着，彼此扭住打。因爲他是穿的紳士衣服，講的英語，印度阿三對他恭敬三分不敢逮捕，别的人如酒館老板娘和賣淫婦那些白俄又不敢帮外國水兵的忙，就這樣兩人扭打了好半天。後來那外國水兵氣力小，打不過他，逃進酒館裏頭去了，他奏了凱旋之歌回到家裏興奮得就如一個民族英雄打勝仗歸來一樣。</p>
<p>可是，他是受了傷！第二天進了醫院。</p>
<p>他在醫院裏頭，熱度一百零五，白天裏還在說夢囈。</p>
<p>「那水兵，那外國劊子手，打，打，送他回老家去！」</p>
<p>「曼麗，曼麗，你回來了？我將那外國水兵打啦。」</p>
<p>「你不贊成？你說我魯莽？我是在打帝國主義者喲！」</p>
<p>「曼麗，曼麗，你怎麽對我生氣呢？……」</p>
<p>「曼麗，Ｄarling，你不能離開我喲！」</p>
<p>「曼麗，你得了解我。」</p>
<p>「曼麗，曼麗！你！你！…」</p>
<p>他發了狂啦！他打了看護婦，駡她是外國的下流胚子，他從床上跳下來了，到處打人，將醫院的秩序都閙翻了。</p>
<p>曼麗，他進醫院那一天，我給你打的一封電報，你難道是收不到嗎？你竟忍心不來看他，這是你的錯了！</p>
<p>你的錯是不了解他。你不用爭辯，你雖然明白了他的心境，可是你不明白他的心境究竟爲什麽那樣，這就是你對他的不了解。</p>
<p>在這動亂的時代裏頭，一個有思想有頭腦有作爲的靑年，他一定是參加政治運動；他的敏捷的神經感覺到被壓迫的人們在動着的脈搏，他一定是要跑到時代的前鋒去做一番有益國家社會人類的事業；一旦受了環境的欺詐，同伴黯淡的澆薄，政治前途的黯淡…，種種的剌激，他一定是憤恨莫名，找尋麻醉。這一種幻滅的情緒，没落的悲哀，是時代給他的，也是他自己的階級命運招尋來的。人傑就是許許多多這樣的靑年中的一個。他這一種煩悶苦惱，因爲你没有政治的思想而不了解，你難道能够說他不敎你了解是他的錯嗎？</p>
<p>曼麗，　　該認識你自己，你自己是一個落伍的女子呵！</p>

<h3>裸體電影的勃興（上）</h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>風行一時的預光已見</p>
<p>美國已開始籌備新片</p>
<p>大家現在都在問：「裸體電影是否能在不久的將來，變成風行一時的一種電影，如同我們所已經有的「西部電影」，「社會電影」等等一樣的有被承認的地位？」或者：「靑年的史密斯先生和史密斯夫人，是否會在一兩年之後，在一天晚上辯論著，還是帶他們的孩子去看旅行片子呢，還是去看裸體片子呢？」請你們先不要說不能或不會。因爲裸體影片，現在已經在美國出現了。裸體運動園的影片，已經看得見了。裏面的演員，一個一個都是赤裸裸的。還有許多已經在攝製之中。現在差不多每個製片家，都在轉着念頭，想着主意，怎樣應用這方興未艾的裸體運動的主旨，來拍攝幾張應時的片子。</p>
<p>「返諸天然」（Ｂack　to　Nature）是裸體影片的先驅者。它已經給與美國一般製片家，一個風行一時可能性的印象。它放映的時候，戲院裏的觀衆會滿坑滿谷，擠得水洩不通的。第二張片子就是Ｂrvan　Foy　編的，更爲親切描寫的，更爲富有劇情的「愛利西亞村」（Ｅlysia）。它的吸引力，比之「返諸天然」還要厲害。這種題材，在現在題材缺少煩悶之中，好像發現了一個新園地，使大家感得無窮的興奮和激刺。</p>
<p>個裸體運動家的愛情故事，一定要比現行的「衣冠影片」裏所有的，來得新鮮有趣。有許多製片家，已經看到不久的將來，而聯想到用什麽演員來拍攝祷種新式樣的片子了。但是還有多少時候，他們就可以在會議的時候，討論到那些嘉寳們，或是黛德麗許們，還是拍張冬天用的片子呢，還是留待春天，而先拍一張「衣冠」影片呢？請你們亦不要笑，因爲這種理想，不久一定會成爲事實的。你若不信，看派拉蒙取近的和散萊蘭德（Ｓally　Ｒand）簽訂合同就知道了。散萊蘭德是芝加哥世界博覽會裏一個裸體跳舞家。派拉蒙看見她體態豐美，就將她羅致了，給她每星期五千美金的合同。雖然現在還没有談到拍裸體影片的事情，但是派拉蒙公司的先著祖鞭，的確很明顯地表示了此後影片作風的趨向。</p>
<p>據可靠方面的傳說，葛雷泰嘉寳是很贊成這種新運動的。倘使有適當的裸體影片的脚本給她做，她一定肯脫去了衣衫表演的，因爲她本來是一位裸體日光浴的信徒。此外還有許多其他的明星，已經在那裏轉念頭，考慮這個問題了。你試閉目想一想，瓊克勞馥和克拉克蓋博，在一個裸體愛情片子裏做兩個男女主角！或是莊耐威斯穆勒和琪哈羅！而最可奇怪的，是那位體態豐肥，肉香四溢的梅薇絲，倒是一位反對裸體影片的女子。她說脫去衣服是人人會的，但是要眞果的做到藝術上的動人，使看客的想象昇騰到九霄雲裏的，還是非穿衣服不可。所以女子一定要有適當的衣着，還要知道怎樣應用它們才興。（未完）</p>
<h3>藍鷹運動中的華納公司的作風</h3>
<p>— 安定</p>
<p>美國自從民主黨羅斯福執政後，華納兄弟公司已無形的變成了民主黨的宣傳機關。現在的電影藝術，被每一個國家，作爲敎育和宣傳的工具，社會主義之蘇聯，法西斯蒂的意大利和德意志，都盡量地發揮了它底宣傳與敎育的作用。資本主義的美利堅，當然也不能例外，故美國自從羅斯福登台後，華納兄弟公司遂成爲藍鷹運動中的宣傳利器。</p>
<p>國際列强間第二次分贓大戰，轉瞬間就要爆發。聰明的羅斯福，他知道二次大戰的危機就在目前，他知道又將要驅使千萬的無辜人民赴戰塲，作他們當權者，執政者，銀行家，××大王……等等的犧牲品。因此，他不得不來一下麻醉運動。同時，他在另一方面還可以籍此攻擊敵黨｜共和黨，取得民衆同情，鞏固民主黨的政權。</p>
<p>一九三三年，華納兄弟公司在民主黨的指揮之下，大理的攝製鼓吹羅斯福的復興運動。如已在上海開映的以失業工人爲題材的「歌舞昇平」，與「四十二號街」。現在又有退伍廢兵爲題材的「Ｈeroes　For　Sale」（該片：日本譯爲議俄之美利堅），但照原文，似該譯爲：「拍賣英雄」或「英雄無價」。）過去的此類美國片，除了娛樂與陶醉之外，是别無企圖的，但是，現在却大不相同了，如「歌舞昇平」，及「Ｈeroes　For　Sale」等等片，實際上都成了宣傳民主黨政綱的喉舌了。華納兄弟公司，現在旣有了這般的政治背景，它的作風，當然也隨着大局而「轉變」。</p>
<p>最近美國有個非常重大的間題，就是「退伍廢兵問題」，民主黨的華納公司，爲着要博得民衆的同情，便利用「反對停止退伍廢兵給養一的漂亮動聽的口號，來攝製這部「飢餓的美堅利」。「飢餓的美利堅」的攝製，卽根據這三項原則：</p>
<p>（一）反對停止退伍廢兵的給養，</p>
<p>（二）廢兵的待遇問題，</p>
<p>（三）失業者的救濟運動。内容係描寫前年春天（一九三二年二月）美京華盛頓來了二萬餘退伍廢兵，包圍白宮，游行演講，反對美政府共和黨主政時代的棄養，要求政府履行義務。可是那次轟轟烈烈的示威運動被華納兄弟歪曲地描寫了。簡直是侮辱了那次英勇的鬥爭，和二萬餘的鬥士們。</p>
<p>現在在新大陸的金之邦，都充滿着飢餓的喊聲了。但是，藍鷹運動能拯救現在的美國媽？飢寒壓逼着的千千萬的「被忘却了好人們」｜退伍廢兵，失業工人｜能轉從羅斯福手中獲得麫包嗎？</p>
<h3>安那史丹的可可舞　炳</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>俄國明星安娜史丹，自從到好萊塢進了聯藝影片公司之後，因爲她身體太肥胖了，所以一向没有上過鐘頭。現在她將演一部新片Ｇola's　Nana了。在這新片中她將跳一種特别的舞，稱爲「可可」舞，Can　Can　dance，這種舞是各國所從未見過的，尚有二隻可可舞的歌曲，亦將由她担任歌唱。現在她已經很能上鏡頭了，她已從一百五十磅的體重减爲一百二十磅，能够輕便的跳舞了。</p>
<p>安娜史丹有一件特長，她能够同時表演多種人物的表情，有一次她在聯藝公司試騐，一共表演了五十一個不同的人，她能改變頭髮，更能改變聲音，改變態度，從小孩子演起，可以演到做母親。她在可可舞中就是表演她這一點的特長之處。</p>
<p>安娜史丹因爲不善於操英語，所以現在落人之後，實在她有很好的藝術，她在從前曾演過四部影片，但是她所開口的都只是幾句簡單的話，現在她的英語已經學得很好了，據聯藝公司的經理茂萊雪佛斯東對於她的評論，說她將來一定是一個很有爲的電影界人物。</p>
<h3>賈里古柏的失戀</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>像賈里古柏這種美貌的明星，許多人都以爲是享盡人間艶福的了，那知事實是完全相反，他却時常嘗着失戀的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>他初戀的女子，是一個大學生時代的同班生，名字呌做黛麗絲。賈里把她留在故鄉，跑到好萊塢去找他的「幸運」，最後終於得到一個在武俠片中，當片段演員的機會，而在這時期間，因爲不大勤於和黛麗絲通函的緣故，黛麗絲以爲他遺棄了她，遂和鄉村的藥劑師結婚了。</p>
<p>他和熱女郎克拉拉寳也曾有過一段艶史，那時克拉拉寳已經是成名的明星，而他還不過是初登銀壇的，因此這件事大半是女人主動的，但是輕浮的克拉拉寳决不會永遠以那「泥臭」的賈里爲滿足，因此他們倆的羅曼斯不久亦就消滅了。</p>
<p>後來，他又和那生於墨西哥的熱情女郎露妃維萊絲戀愛，然而不到一年，却被女的逃跑了，古柏到菲洲去打獵，亦就是爲了這次失戀的事。</p>
<h3>史東山自編「女人」</h3>
<p>— 波浪</p>
<p>黎明暉胡萍等主演</p>
<p>史東山導演的『女人』，快將開拍了。因爲劇本審查會對於藝華公司史東山自編的『女人』劇本，表示很滿意，同時，在劇本的另一張批上這幾句：『此片頗有意味，也近世俗情理：』的話，自然，這無異給藝華公司不少人一個興奮的接力啊？</p>
<p>所以，史東山預備再略事修改之後，正式開拍了，這裏，我告訴幾個這片的主角在下面：</p>
<p>女主角：（一）黎明暉，（二）胡萍，（三）黃耐霜。男主角：（一）王引，（二）王乃東，（三）秦桐。其他男女要角，也都是電影界中很有地位的人。</p>
<p>據說：『女人』中的一個女主角，非常合於黎明暉的個性，所以，史東山想了許多法子，去請黎明暉，而黎明暉也十分願意，當然，在這雙方的同意下，『女人』主角就毫無問題了。這樣，你總可以知道『女人』的開攝期是不遠了吧。</p>

<h3>婆心劇盜Ｂroadway　Thru　a　Keyhole（四）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>「那是兩樣的」，她說。羅其又問她道：「你知道不知道，這兒祇有我和你兩個人，現在已經過了半夜，並且你現在坐的是我的床」。瓊抬起頭來對他看着，她說：「不過我是相信你的」。羅其無可奈何的笑了一笑，他將一隻手，很和氣的摸着瓊的手。他說：「瓊，你說得不差。你可以相信我。我馬上就要送你回家。你失去了美容的睡眠，趕快去補足吧」。這樣說着，他果眞將瓊蕙蘭送回去了。</p>
<p>到了明天，羅其跑到喀來夜總會的公事房裏。他對着夜總會的老班娘泰克絲道：「這個地方，兩萬塊錢讓給我，好不好」？泰克絲很隨意地坐在大椅子裏，拿一支香烟，裝在很長很長的象牙烟嘴裏，慢慢地說道：「那有什麽可以不可以，讓就讓給你好了」。羅其於是就吩咐查克，去將導演跳舞的麥克斯找來。一回兒查克和麥克斯來了。羅其問着他：「瓊蕙蘭不是跳舞跳得不差嗎」？那跳舞導演看見羅其心裏有些害怕，一時說不出話來。羅其又對着麥克斯道：「你可以將節目調動一下，想法子呌瓊蕙蘭做一個主角」。麥克斯將手一摔，對着羅其道：「羅其先生，這是你開玩笑了。你想看奇蹟嗎？你要求的，簡捷是不可能的事」。那盜魁忍着氣道：「麥克斯，我恐怕你誤會了。我没有什麽要求你的。我呌你這樣做，你就這樣做好了」。麥克斯臉上顯出十二分爲難的樣子。但他没有法子違背這位新老班的命令。</p>
<p>麥克斯很辛苦的將這位新出世的歌舞明星敎練了幾天。到了新戲開幕的那天晚上，瓊蕙蘭在她的化妝室裏，她的姊姊薏塞爾的查克的女朋友茜别兒亦在那裏。薏塞爾對着瓊道：外面大家一定會奇怪的，喀萊夜總會裏怎麽來了這麽一個新角色，居然一來就做起台柱子。大家亦會想到喀萊夜總會一定有人收買了。爲什麽收買呢？當然逃不出一個普遍的法律，就是愛情的指使罷了」。瓊說道：「我到現在還不明白，他是什麽意思」。一回兒一個電影報送了進來。瓊拆開一看，上面寫着：「瓊，好自爲之。羅共」。幾個字。她的手抖了。她說：「時候已經到了，我一定要做得好才興呢」！</p>
<p>瓊登台了。羅共一言不發地在台上看着。他看看瓊，又看看台下各張檯子上坐客的臉。</p>
<p>他知道瓊很可以。等到表演到將近高潮的時候，各人的情緒，亦跟着緊張起來了。隨後就是一陣狂呼鼓掌的聲音。等到戲表演完了，羅共跑到瓊的化妝室裏。瓊那時正伏在她姊姊伊塞爾的眉膀上，忽啼忽笑地喊道：「哦，我眞快活死了，他們都這樣喜歡我」！她屢次三番地說着。從此以後，羅其没有一天晚上不到喀萊夜總會，没有一天不買些花送給夜總會裏的那個新主角。（未完）</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Reports on the Work of the Economic Commission at the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Past Period Was for Preparatory Work</p>
<p>From Now On, Efforts Will Be Made to Implement It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Mr. Song Ziwen reported on the work of the National Economic Commission to all Central Committee members at the Fourth Plenary Session on the 22nd. This morning, the reporter visited Mr. Song at his residence and inquired about the content of his report. Mr. Song graciously narrated the report as follows: At this time of national crisis, all undertakings in our country lag behind others. The government and people of society alike feel that the future of the country cannot be saved unless we devote all our efforts to production and develop economic construction. Hence, the establishment of the National Economic Commission. However, in recent years, domestic and foreign troubles have come one after another. The government and the people's financial resources are barely enough to cope with the current difficulties, let alone have surplus resources to engage in economic construction. However, because the survival of the country is at stake, we must try our best to struggle to open up a path to survival. Therefore, despite the devastation, we do not hesitate to engage in difficult creation, first sow seeds, and give them time to germinate and flourish. Economic construction has myriad aspects, but if it is only presided over by the government, the strength is insufficient and the results are few. It is necessary to jointly operate with all sectors of society in order to achieve success. Therefore, in 1931, the Preparatory Office of the National Economic Commission was established, and leading figures from all sectors of society were invited to be members in order to gather wisdom and strength from all. At the beginning of the establishment of the commission, it was immediately hit by the September 18th Incident, coupled with the unprecedented Yangtze River flood. The government and society gathered all their strength to provide disaster relief, and they did not have time to take care of other things. When the disaster relief work was mostly successfully completed, the unfinished undertakings and remaining funds were handed over to the Economic Commission for acceptance and handling. At that time, the Economic Commission had the strength to carry out a small part of its work. The work of the Economic Commission first focused on the development of transportation. In view of the fact that the roads in various provinces, although under construction, were limited by financial resources, and there was no overall plan between provinces, it was difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the commission considered the actual situation, borrowed funds, and helped them complete the routes. On the one hand, it provided technical assistance, determined construction standards, and supervised the progress. In terms of hygiene, our country has never had a public organization, and the Ministry of Health is even more difficult to implement due to insufficient funds. The commission also provided subsidies and invited many experts from the League of Nations to come to China to help with the design. Over the past two years, the results have been remarkable. Our country's silk industry has declined due to outdated technology. The deterioration of the rural economy in Jiangnan is an important reason for this. Upon the establishment of the commission, it hired expert Dr. Ma Lian to come to China to conduct research and investigation in order to improve it and save it. The countryside is the basic organization of the country. Compared with the decline of all industries, the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy, and relief cannot be delayed. The commission hired Dr. Duconi as a consultant to study a fundamental plan for rectification in order to revive the countryside and enrich the people's livelihood. In terms of education, experts from Britain, France, Italy, and Germany were invited to conduct on-site inspections and study improvements in order to lay the foundation for popularizing education and cultivating talents. The above undertakings concerning water conservancy projects, road construction, health equipment, rural relief, and educational improvement were all planned and carried out by the commission at the same time, and some of those that have already been implemented have achieved good results. When Ziwen was on a mission to the United States last year, he was entrusted by the government to conclude a cotton and wheat loan. The government officials decided that this was the first successful foreign debt borrowing since the establishment of the National Government and decided to use it entirely for production undertakings and hand it over to the Economic Commission for distribution. When Ziwen was in Europe and the United States, he realized that friendly countries sympathized with our country and expressed their willingness to provide assistance in economic construction and were willing to invest, but at that time, our country did not have a complete and detailed plan, and even if various countries wanted to invest, they were at a loss as to where to start. Therefore, we first cooperated with the League of Nations in terms of technology as the origin of economic cooperation with various friendly countries. Economic cooperation cannot be achieved by empty talk. There must be obvious facts before it can gain the sympathy of the public. In the future, the only policy of the Economic Commission will be to earnestly work hard on construction with its inherent funds on the one hand, and to concentrate talents, investigate and research, and make practical plans on the other hand, in order to win the support of the whole people at home and the belief of friendly countries abroad. The future of economic construction should have satisfactory results. The central government recognizes the importance of the Economic Commission, so after Ziwen returned to China, it reorganized the commission into a committee system, with Chiang, Wang, Sun, Kong, and Ziwen as standing committee members, and actively began to carry out the work. However, in recent months, there have been many incidents, and both standing committee members Chiang and Sun are not in Nanjing. The standing committee meeting cannot be convened, and various major policies cannot be decided as a result. At this Fourth Plenary Session, all the standing committee members are gathered in the capital, and the standing committee meeting will definitely be held in the next few days. All plans can be decided here. Therefore, the past period was the preparatory work for the Economic Commission, and from now on, it will enter the implementation period, which should be welcomed by the people of the country.

<h3>Anglo-Dutch Secret Agreement and British Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Ever since Japan seized Manchuria and actively prepared for war, peace in the Far East has been on the verge of danger. Recently, it has held a puppet regime in place to claim an emperor and has tried to carry out a monopolistic policy in the Far East market. Not only have the United States and the Soviet Union been concerned about this, but also the interests of Britain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands in the Far East have been affected. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressed the "Yellow Peril" theory earlier, and former French Prime Minister Herriot discussed the Far East crisis with concern later. Today's Singapore Imperial Naval Military Conference, convened by Britain, is regarded by the Japanese as a dark cloud over the Pacific. It can be seen that various countries are urgently rising up to deal with Japan's monopolistic policy. The situation of tit-for-tat is already obvious. As for the Netherlands, as a small European country, it has always attached importance to colonial interests, especially the natural resources of the East Indies in the Pacific as the core of its national power. Therefore, its vigilance against Japan's ambitions is always present. According to a previous Lianhe News Agency telegram, the Japanese Consul in Chicago, Mutō, telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that a certain newspaper in Chicago had published that the Netherlands had established a secret naval agreement with Britain due to its relationship with the East Indies territory. The editorial also stated, "The dangerous object of the Dutch East Indies is Japan. The reason is the Borneo oil issue, which may cause disputes. Therefore, the Netherlands wants to place it under the protection of the British Navy." From this speculation, although nothing is known about the content of the agreement, it is highly possible that the Netherlands will unite with the British for the sake of safeguarding its interests. In terms of the economic status of the Dutch East Indies and its relationship with Japan, it is also closely related to the future of peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>The so-called Dutch East Indies usually includes Java, Sumatra, Dutch Borneo, Sulawesi, and other numerous islands. The total area is about 740,000 square miles, which is about seven times that of the Philippine Islands and fourteen times that of the British Malay Peninsula. It has a population of over 60 million, while the Philippines has only 13 million and the Malay Peninsula has less than 5 million. It is located southwest of the Philippines, between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The wealth of resources, such as rubber, sugar, tea, coal, tin, and oil, is all available. Japanese immigrants and investments in the area have been around for a long time, and it has almost become the center of Japanese economic power in Southeast Asia today.</p>
<p>Secondly, Japan's trade relations in the East Indies are also in an absolutely advantageous position. In 1932, Japan's imports from the East Indies totaled 100 million yen, which is higher than that of the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, and the United States. In the same year, Japan's total exports from the East Indies were only 40 million yen. It can be seen that Japanese goods in the East Indies market are quite sufficient to overwhelm Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries and occupy a surplus position.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Dutch Borneo produces approximately 5 million metric tons of oil annually, which is one-twentieth of the total annual production in the United States. It is the most important oil source in Asia after Persia. Japan has always been an oil-importing country, and more than half of its oil is supplied by the East Indies. In the eleven months of 1933, the national oil imports with a specific gravity below 0.8762 were approximately 120 million gallons, of which 60 million gallons were imported from the East Indies. The national oil imports with a specific gravity below 0.73 were approximately 730,000 gallons, of which 670,000 gallons were imported from the East Indies. This is enough to show the extent of the importance of the Borneo oil mine to Japan's economy and national defense.</p>
<p>From the above, Japan has already gained a very close relationship with the economic status of the Dutch East Indies. If the Japanese once engage in economic aggression in Southeast Asia and do not hesitate to cause serious conflicts with the Far East interests of the British, then how dangerous will Britain be? Britain has been threatened by this major threat to its naval position in the Far East. Naturally, it must join hands with the Netherlands. With common interests, they must be close to each other. This is the natural trend.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese warlords are trying their best to realize the Asian Monroe Doctrine, they are only provoking the ill will of other countries. British territories have been stimulated by Japanese economic aggression so much that they have no choice but to devise a naval defense plan. Therefore, although the details of the Singapore Naval Conference are not yet clear, it can be predicted that there will be a strict arrangement to deal with Japan. On the one hand, it uses its diplomatic means to contact the Netherlands. Military strategy and diplomacy go hand in hand. It can be said that it has done everything possible to deal with Japan with meticulous planning. Is this why the Japanese feel the dimness of the Pacific war clouds and are frightened and uneasy?</p>
<h3>The Sun-Ma Conflict Escalates</h3>
<p>Both Sides Telegraph, Claiming Oppression</p>
<p>Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces Implement Joint Defense</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Actively Expands Troops</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, concerned about the conflict between the Sun and Ma armies, intends to mediate. Wang Shiping visited Huang today afternoon, reporting on the conflict between the Sun and Ma armies. This evening, the 41st Army office received a telegram from Sun at the front, reporting that the Ma army has been actively oppressing for days, and the war has gradually escalated. The North China authorities have repeatedly received telegrams from Ningxia, stating that the Sun army's siege of Pingluo is very urgent, and that the Sun army's westward advance aims to pass through Ningxia to Shaanxi. Zhu Shaoliang has telegraphed Ping for days, expressing concrete opinions on resolving the Sun-Ma incident. The Ping authorities received an urgent telegram from Ma today, reporting that the Sun army's attack on Pingluo is fierce. Tianjin received a telegram from Sun, expressing being oppressed and reaching the point of final tolerance. The Gansu army Ma Bufang's division has arrived in Ningxia, and Hu Zongnan's division is concentrated in Lanzhou. The military of a certain Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu province has implemented joint defense. A major war in the Northwest is imminent. How to deal with it? He's response awaits Chiang's telegram decision. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The North China military authorities and the central government have decided that the Sun troops should remain stationed in the Wuyuan, Suiyuan, and Linhe areas until the weather warms up, then a new relocation site will be determined. It is said that the issue will be discussed at tomorrow's Military Affairs Commission's routine meeting. He Yingqin will telegraph Sun tonight, instructing the troops to stop advancing westward and await orders. Hou Cheng's visit to Shanxi to discuss with Yan is also based on this point. Yan has already dissuaded Sun from advancing westward based on this intention. However, it is still difficult to predict whether Sun will stop military action as a result. According to a telegram from Ningxia, the Sun army cavalry is surrounding Pingluo County, and its infantry still intends to bypass Pingcheng and advance westward. The Ningxia provincial army, in order to protect the territory and secure the people, will cooperate to block the attack. Since Sun incorporated the bandits of Yang Xiaohou and Wang Ying, he has expanded the troop numbers greatly. Currently, Sun's troops include four infantry divisions: the 127th, 118th, and 119th divisions, each with three brigades, each brigade with three regiments; the 120th division with two regiments and one special service regiment; and a supplementary brigade, three cavalry divisions, each with three regiments; and three cavalry brigades, each with two regiments, as well as one artillery regiment, three battalions each of engineering and supply, and two battalions of military police, totaling more than thirty regiments. Only seven regiments of Sun's troops have been registered with the Military Affairs Commission, with a monthly budget of 220,000 yuan. Now it has increased a lot. The Military Affairs Commission will discuss the issue of Sun's expanded troops tomorrow. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui telegraphed Ping twenty times, stating that the enemy attacking Pingluo launched a fierce attack from all sides with artillery fire at midnight on the 20th. On the 21st, at dawn, the enemy infantry was extremely fierce, charging to the base of the city and climbing the city walls at great risk. The officers and soldiers of our Second Brigade bravely resisted, and after a fierce battle until noon, they were finally repelled. The enemy cavalry suffered too many casualties and appeared to be fleeing in panic. From the north of Pingluo City to Huangge, since the enemy surrounded the city, the enemy artillery has been constantly concentrating its bombardment. Our defending soldiers are doing their best to hold on, and are still in a stalemate. According to Zhang Chengde, an enemy artillery soldier captured, the enemy's main force has concentrated in the area north of Pingluo City, with twelve 36-style long-barreled guns, four mountain guns, and twelve heavy mortars. Sun Dianying and Liu Yueting are both in Huangquqiao, etc. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Hou Cheng, representative of the Ping Military Affairs Commission, received a telegram from He, instructing him to stay in Taiyuan for a while, pending the resolution of the Sun-Ma affair. Wang Jingguo is scheduled to visit Yan on the 32nd to report on the recent situation of defense after the departure of the Sun troops in western Suiyuan. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A senior staff officer said that the war between the Sun and Ma armies has not stopped, and the two armies are still in a stalemate between Pingluo, Shizuishan, and Ningyuan. If the Ma troops lose Pingluo, then Ningxia will not be secure, so the two armies are fighting fiercely here. Although the central government has sent telegrams strictly ordering both sides to stop military action, the Sun troops, with their motley crowd of 60,000, disregard everything and continue to advance westward. The General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission is drafting a plan to deal with the situation, which will be submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval on the 23rd. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Will Return to Chahar</h3>

Chiba visited He yesterday to inquire. This morning, Song and Qin Dechun visited He to report that no troops have been added. Song will submit a report at tomorrow's Military Affairs Commission's routine meeting, and then determine a method to respond to the Japanese side. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun Tells German Reporters That the Japanese Army's Ambition is to Gradually Seize Eastern Mongolia</h3>
<p>Our Country Persists in the Doctrine of Non-Recognition, and the Situation Between Japan and Russia Remains Very Tense</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, met with the Geneva correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt and stated that China would adhere to its position of non-recognition regarding the situation created by Japan in the Far East. Mr. Gu pointed out that Japan's recent military actions, with its troops gradually expanding the area they occupy, have the clear purpose of annexing eastern Mongolia into the puppet state. The speed with which this plan is achieved depends on how Japan's relations with Soviet Russia develop. Although there have been reports of a gradual easing between the two countries recently, it is questionable whether this is simply the calm before a major storm. As for the puppet Puyi's claim to the throne, it has little practical effect, as Japan's ruling power remains unchanged. Mr. Gu also spoke of the good feelings between China and Germany, such as Germany's relinquishment of consular jurisdiction, which not only does not harm the safety of the German people, but has certainly increased the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. This can be seen in the fact that German goods sell well in China and that the Chinese government employs many German advisors. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Cotton Industry Area Holds a Large Demonstration Against Japanese Goods Dumping</h3>
<p>Demanding That the Government Abolish Preferential Treatment for Japan</p>
<p>Manchester Chamber of Commerce Offers Friendly Advice to Japan</p>
<p>(London) Manchester will hold a large demonstration against the dumping of foreign goods tomorrow. Representatives from all parts of the cotton goods industry and mayors from the most important cities in Lancashire will participate. The public will focus on Japanese competition and will discuss a resolution asking the government to abolish all most-favored-nation treatment treaties between Britain and Japan, and to use its influence to persuade the dominions and colonies to do the same. It is also planned to ask the government to enact laws prohibiting (1) the export of old British machinery, (2) the employment of foreign students in British factories, (3) British investment in Japanese industry, and (4) the misappropriation of British trademarks. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The annual report of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce contained friendly advice to Japan. The report acknowledged that the hard-working and enlightened Japanese people had a legitimate desire to advance their country, and continued that if the Japanese proceeded in an orderly and gradual manner, without creating an intolerable situation for other countries, their prosperity would be more stable and lasting than if they hastily disrupted the established patterns of world trade. The final result might be a solution that strengthens the world economy and contributes to the peaceful progress of all countries. The report also stated that the board of directors of the Chamber of Commerce felt that this matter involved the interests of the British people to a great extent and could no longer afford to waste time and wait for Japan's response. Therefore, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce are now preparing to begin active negotiations as soon as possible. If the current situation continues, the only way to solve the problem mutually is for Japan to adopt a plan to limit the quantity of its exports and set prices similar to those of Western products, otherwise the domestic and colonial markets within the British Empire will have to protect themselves with tariffs, quotas, or prohibitions, and other countries in the same situation will do the same.

<h3>Sino-US Cotton and Wheat Loan Agreement to Be Amended Soon</h3>
<p>It is Not Easy for Our Country to Promote American Cotton</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Jesse Jones, director of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), announced that the Chinese government could not purchase $40 million worth of American cotton as agreed, so the two sides are now discussing reducing China's $50 million cotton and wheat loan. Jones also said that this loan was signed by Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen when he came to Washington, with $40 million for purchasing American cotton and $10 million for purchasing American wheat. However, to date, the Chinese government has only purchased $7 million worth of American cotton, and it is feared that the Chinese government will not be able to purchase the full $40 million worth of American cotton by the expiration date of the loan on July 1 this year. As for the $10 million wheat loan, Jones believes that it can be done, as the Chinese government seems to find it easier to promote American wheat than American cotton. How much the loan amount will be reduced is still under discussion, but Jones declined to say whether this move was initiated by the Chinese government. According to a recent Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai, the Chinese government does intend to amend the loan agreement. Jones also said that the RFC intends to limit its assistance to foreign countries in purchasing American goods in the future, as the RFC should not be lending to foreign countries at all.

<p>The Japanese Parliament Reopens</p>
<h3>Saitō Announces Administrative Policy, Hirota Delivers Foreign Policy Speech</h3>
<p>Protecting the Puppet Manchuria, Inducing Friendship with China</p>
<p>Extravagant Talk of Peace with Russia, Easing Feelings with America</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The parliament, after its recess, convened at 10 a.m. on the morning of the 1st. First, Prime Minister Saitō delivered a policy speech in the Upper House, lasting about 20 minutes, followed by Foreign Minister Hirota's foreign policy speech, also lasting about 20 minutes. Then, Count Niara, of the Research Association, began a sharp interrogation on the issue of ideology, taking the first shot in the questioning war. The Lower House convened at 1 p.m. After Saitō and Hirota delivered the same speeches, Finance Minister Takahashi followed with a speech on financial policy. Mr. Tokonami Takejirō of the Seiyukai party fired the first arrow of questioning, followed by Mr. Machida Chuji of the Minseitō party. The leaders of the two parties, who had been silent for years, began a sharp questioning war. (23rd Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota delivered a speech on foreign policy in the House of Peers at 11 a.m. today. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese government and the League of Nations have unfortunately held greatly differing opinions regarding the Manchurian Incident, the issue of "Manchukuo," and the fundamental significance of maintaining peace in East Asia, to the extent that it was compelled to announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations. At the time of deciding on this important event, His Majesty the Emperor issued an imperial rescript, clearly declaring the path that our country should take. The rescript stated:</p>
<p>"Japan, now that 'Manchukuo' is newly established, respects its independence and promotes its healthy development as the basis for removing the roots of disaster in East Asia and ensuring world peace. Furthermore, while I have always desired the establishment of international peace and have never ceased to do so, I will continue to cooperate with all countries in all peaceful endeavors. Although we are now separated from the League of Nations, in accordance with what the Empire believes, we are certainly not neglecting the friendship of friendly nations by focusing solely on East Asia. It is my constant concern, day and night, to have great faith in international affairs and to manifest great righteousness throughout the world."</p>
<p>The people of our country should henceforth work together in unity and strive to live up to the imperial will. Then, the Empire's bright and upright attitude will surely be thoroughly understood by the world, and the Empire's future will be full of brilliance. When I handle foreign relations, I will follow this imperial rescript and devote all my efforts to "thinking of world peace and implementing our country's policies through diplomatic means." Fortunately, the Empire's relations with friendly nations have become even closer and more amicable in terms of diplomacy and trade after our withdrawal from the League of Nations. I am extremely gratified.</p>
<h3>Assisting Manchukuo's Independence</h3>
<p>Since its founding, "Manchukuo," which has a close and special relationship with the Empire, has been steadily advancing its construction, thanks to the wise rule of Emperor Puyi and the unremitting efforts of the country's government, as well as the Empire's assistance based on the spirit of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. Various facilities are gradually being put in place, especially the maintenance of its public order, the development of industry and transportation, the establishment of its finances, and the progress of its education. Not only can it demonstrate remarkable achievements, but the issue of the imperial system, which the country's government and people have been looking forward to, is also about to be realized. The foundation of this newly independent country is becoming increasingly solid. This is not only something for "Manchukuo" to celebrate, but also for the peace of the Far East and the peace of the world. We must continue to follow the instructions of the imperial rescript, and the government and people must work together to provide vigorous assistance to the country's development.</p>
<h3>Singing the Praises of Good Neighborliness with China</h3>
<p>The Japanese government believes that it has a major responsibility to maintain peace in East Asia, and it has a firm and unwavering determination to do so. It believes that the stability of China itself is the most important situation for peace in East Asia. Therefore, it is the sincere hope of the Japanese government that China will quickly restore its public order and prosperity. It can be said to be the natural mission of China and Japan to maintain good-neighborly and mutual relations and to contribute to the peace and development of East Asia. However, when we look at the Chinese political situation, it is still far from the realization of such hopes, which is extremely regrettable. According to the information we have received, the Chinese government has only recently realized that the anti-Japanese policy it had adopted in the past was wrong and has decided to open up Sino-Japanese relations. However, as of today, we have not been able to find concrete facts to prove this information. If China understands Japan's true intentions and sincerely expresses its sincerity, then Japan has long been willing to fully accommodate China's goodwill and attitude. The fact that the area north of the Yellow River is maintaining a relatively peaceful state under the control of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee is gratifying. In view of the contiguous relationship between "Manchukuo" and North China, and in order to maintain the armistice agreement in North China, the Japanese government is particularly concerned about the maintenance of its public order and hopes that no disturbances will occur. At the same time, the Japanese government is paying close attention to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party and the rampant activities of the Communist armies.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>Looking back at the diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, since the establishment of the Basic Treaty of Beijing in 1925, the two countries have maintained normal contact. Even after the Manchurian Incident, they were able to understand each other's positions and did not encounter the occurrence of difficult problems. However, the Soviet Union's recent attitude towards our country has not only given us a sense of some changes, but the Soviet Union has also frequently released criticisms of our country to the inside and outside through news and communications, deliberately publicizing the deterioration of the situation and using it for its internal affairs and diplomatic work. This is something that Japan is deeply surprised and regrets. The Japanese government has always taken a fair attitude towards the Soviet Union, whether before or after the Manchurian Incident, and has always been consistent and unchanged. Although Japan and Russia have fundamental points of incompatibility in terms of national system and ideology, they always seek to continue good-neighborly relations and strive to resolve doubts by peaceful means. After the establishment of "Manchukuo," the adjustment of the diplomatic relations between Japan, "Manchukuo," and Russia, based on the directly contiguous border, is considered the most necessary belief for peace in East Asia, and we continue to work towards this. Although it has been publicized by the Soviet Union, the Japanese military has not built any new military installations on the Manchu-Russian border. In addition, the Japanese government has been mediating the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway for the past year since June, which is also in line with the implementation and purpose of this policy. The Japanese government is confident that the Soviet Union will soon understand our country's sincerity. Although the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway are currently suspended, we hope that the negotiations will resume soon.</p>
<h3>Easing Feelings with the United States</h3>
<p>Next, considering the relations between Japan and the United States, it can be said that there are no fundamental problems that are difficult to solve between Japan and the United States. Japan has always sincerely hoped to maintain good-neighborly relations with the United States and has no intention of deliberately creating incidents. At the same time, it is deeply believed that the United States will not hesitate to understand Japan's position in East Asia. However, since the Manchurian Incident, public opinion in the United States has tended to deteriorate, leading to a sense of emotional estrangement between the two peoples. However, because Japan has no other intention than to establish lasting peace in East Asia, if the United States can recognize the special circumstances of East Asia to some extent and understand the reason why our country is the power for peace and stability in East Asia, then the tension in the relations between Japan and the United States will naturally ease. This is undoubtedly the case. Therefore, Japan sincerely hopes that the two countries will understand each other deeply in view of the important relationship in trade and commerce, enhance the historical friendly relations, and create an atmosphere of peace and tranquility between the two great neighbors across the Pacific, which is both in name and in reality.</p>
<h3>Expecting Friendly Relations with England</h3>
<p>Although the traditional friendly relations between Japan and the British Empire have not been shaken today, the two empires are in similar geographical positions in the Eastern and Western oceans, and the two empires understand each other's positions in all aspects of the world and jointly contribute to world peace. In this sense, we adjust the interests in the issues of trade and commerce, and expect the increase of friendly relations between the two countries. The difficult trade issues that have arisen between Japan and India, an important member of the British Empire, have fortunately come to an end, which is something to be greatly celebrated by both sides in the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Trade Barriers</h3>
<p>Looking at the recent world situation and international relations, it is easy to lose normalcy due to political unrest, economic turmoil, and ideological confusion. It is regrettable that the sense of mutual trust among the people of the world has also weakened as a result. If all countries are open and honest, and understand each other's positions, and promote the great spirit of cooperation among all nations, then the solution of any problem will not be too difficult. I believe that it is important for all countries to improve the habits of suspicion and exclusion, and to enhance the concept of mutual trust and cooperation. However, in terms of trade and commerce, there is no sign of any easing of trade barriers, but rather a worsening trend of increase. The World Economic Conference held in London previously also failed to achieve its expected goals and was disbanded. Recently, as a result of Japan's extremely developed industry, trade has greatly increased. However, many foreign countries have continued to restrict general trade and set up various obstacles to the overseas expansion of Japanese goods. The Japanese government is studying appropriate countermeasures to this. The government believes that mutual understanding of each other's unique cultures is an effective way to enhance understanding between countries. Therefore, in this area, we should respond appropriately to implement appropriate facilities.</p>
<h3>Encouraging National Cooperation</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, it is undeniable that Japan's foreign relations are full of challenges in the present and future. In general, when a country's strength is rising, it encounters many incidents. Therefore, our people should work together in unity and persevere. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we should have unwavering awareness and preparation. At the same time, we should implement just policies and take moderate actions with a calm and determined attitude. Then, not only will Japan have no need to feel uneasy in the future, but its future will be full of hope.</p>
<h3>Relying on Military Force as a Backing</h3>
<p>In short, we must never lose sight of the fact that Japan bears the full responsibility of being the sole cornerstone for maintaining peace in East Asia. Japan's diplomacy and national defense both arise from Japan's important position and responsibility. The very nature of Japan's national defense is both completely defensive and self-defensive. At the same time, Japanese diplomacy also seeks to consistently implement just and reasonable claims based on Japan's mission. I believe that Japan's natural and realistic position will be understood by all countries in the world as a matter of course. (23rd United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Honeyed Words and Hidden Daggers: Britain and Italy Express Skepticism</h3>
<p>Military Control of the Regime Exposes Aggressive Ambitions</p>
<p>(London) The Times of London stated in today's editorial that while the resignation of Japanese Army Minister Araki may herald a shift in Japan's foreign policy, there is currently no clear evidence of such a trend, but one cannot help but hope for it. The civilian politicians of Japan are indeed unable to avoid complaining about the enormous expenses required for maintaining security in Manchuria and preparing for war by the navy and army. However, they ultimately failed to reduce the second-largest budget in Japanese history. Foreign Minister Hirota's speech may somewhat alleviate the anxieties caused by this policy and Araki's remarks. For instance, if progress can be made in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, Hirota's statement that Japan has no hostile intentions towards Russia will be even more powerful. All Englishmen who read Hirota's speech cannot help but feel that his remarks were defensive in nature. Japan's aggressive actions in Shanghai, Manchuria, and elsewhere, even to its allies in Britain, are unsettling, and there is a longing for clear evidence that Japanese politicians are truly regaining control over their national affairs and the destiny of their country. The Daily Mail of London stated that Japan's ambitions for a great empire in East Asia have now become even more questionable. Hirota's speech directly reveals to the world Japan's intention to bring all of China under its control under the pretext of stability. Fortunately, Japan's imperialistic ambitions, even if not factual, may lead to its self-destruction in the course of implementing such grandiose plans. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian criticized the resignation of Japanese Army Minister Araki in today's editorial, stating that Araki's military prestige and insatiable rhetoric have placed him in a prominent position for the past two years, but his colleagues do not entirely obey him, as evidenced by Araki's proposal to convene an international conference on Far Eastern affairs. It also stated that Foreign Minister Hirota's remarks, at first glance, seem to indicate that the Japanese government is now eager to verbally appease the Soviet Union, but the value of these remarks can only be proven by actions. This is nothing more than a credible embellishment for Araki's resignation. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian people were pleased to hear Foreign Minister Hirota's statement in the Diet today that Japanese policy is peaceful and that there is no intention to prepare for war against Russia. Japan's activities in the Far East have long caused considerable anxiety in Italy. A new competition in naval armaments is about to begin, and a war between Japan and Russia with Vladivostok as its objective is highly probable. It is reported that when Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov passed through Italy on his way back to Russia from the United States, he had a detailed discussion on this matter with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Although the Italian people are pleased to hear Hirota's remarks, they feel that concrete evidence is still needed if Russia is to be reassured and if the United States' naval armaments are not to increase further, as general opinion believes that Japan has already caused the United States to become alarmed about the security of its territories in the Pacific. Italian newspapers have recently repeatedly mentioned the dangers in the Far East, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini himself has repeatedly called on Europe to deal with them. As far as Italy is concerned, the so-called dangers are mostly in the commercial field, as Japan has intense competition with Italian merchants in the market. Italians believe that the section of Hirota's speech today that referred to the disruption of the world market and commerce was largely caused by the Japanese themselves. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Saito's Policy Speech</h3>
<p>Supporting Puppets as the Central Policy</p>
<p>Advocating National Rejuvenation Through Hardship to Encourage the People</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Diet reconvened this morning. The Upper House convened at 10:14 AM. Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Hirota successively delivered speeches. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that Japan is currently experiencing internal and external difficulties, that is, a time of emergency. A time of national crisis is a time for national progress. The people must redouble their determination to overcome this period of trial. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito delivered a speech on his policy direction in the Upper House this morning. The outline of his speech is as follows: The birth of a prince at the end of last year has further solidified the foundation of Japan, which is a great honor for the entire nation. Foreign policy will adhere to the principles of the edict issued at the time of withdrawing from the League of Nations on March 27 of last year, maintain friendly relations with all foreign countries, and assist the development of the new nation "Manchukuo" as Japan's most important mission. Supporting "Manchukuo" is based on Japan's fundamental national policy of maintaining peace in the Far East, and at the same time, it can maintain world peace. Japan's relations with all countries in the world remain unchanged. As for the budget for the ninth year of Showa (1934), a tight fiscal policy will be adopted. The total amount is 2,211,200,000 yen. Due to the economic recovery, natural tax revenue increases are expected. Increasing taxes is not yet the right time, so the shortfall will still be covered by issuing public bonds. However, the details will be explained by the Minister of Finance. During this period of global economic recession, since Japan lifted the ban on gold exports, the economic situation has been very good, and trade has been uniquely prosperous. However, the wounds of the rural areas have not yet recovered. Although efforts have been made to seek relief methods since last year, further efforts are still needed. National thought is becoming increasingly extreme, and the people must pay more attention to this matter. The government has taken measures to correct this since last year, making every effort to guide thought and study countermeasures. The Ministry of Education has also newly established an Education Research Department to intensify the study of policies. The government will continue to adopt the Rice Control Law as its principle and seek ways to raise rice prices. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Takahashi's Speech on Finance</h3>
<p>Huge Budget Deficit</p>
<p>Issuing Public Bonds to Make Up for the Shortfall</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened at 1:00 PM today. After the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister delivered their speeches, Finance Minister Takahashi took the stage to deliver a speech on financial policy. The content first explained the outline of the revenue and expenditure budget, and then stated that if ordinary revenue were used as revenue, there would be a huge shortfall. However, because the government considered the current economic situation, it did not reach the time to implement tax increases or establish other plans to increase revenue. In accordance with last year's method, public bond funds were used to offset the revenue shortfall. The Finance Minister then explained the public bond issue, stating that Japan's economic situation is gradually improving, and a large amount of natural revenue increase can be expected in Showa 9 (1934). From this evolution, it is expected to return to the revenue situation of Showa 3 and 4 (1928-1929) soon. However, Japan's finances not only have a large revenue shortfall, but also require very careful consideration of their future. Therefore, the number of public bonds issued must be drastically reduced. The necessary national defense expenses, which cannot be avoided in an emergency, are also calculated according to the principle of saving. As for other expenses, it is impossible to include them arbitrarily, which is truly unavoidable. The people must endure and strive for the future of our country, regardless of revenue or expenditure, and officials and the people must work together to overcome difficulties. The Finance Minister then spoke about the general economic situation in Japan, explaining the general rise in prices, the current situation of foreign trade, and the recovery of national purchasing power and savings. He stated that bank deposits increased by more than 710 million yen last year, and postal savings and trusts also increased by 100 million yen and 160 million yen respectively during the same period. He then stated the government's low-interest policy and talked about the current situation of foreign trade, saying that last year Japan's foreign trade exports were 1,920 million yen and imports were 2,014 million yen, totaling 3,940 million yen, and the trade deficit increased by more than 18 million yen compared to the previous year. However, from the perspective of overall trade, the amount and volume have increased significantly. Finally, the Finance Minister talked about the general trend of the world economy, saying that at present, there are very few countries that adhere to the principle of fair treatment in international commerce, and the world economic situation is still chaotic. Under these circumstances, it is fortunate that Japan's economy has signs of improvement in all aspects. However, the people still need to work hard to reach the stage of complete recovery. The people must forget their private interests and hope for Japan's eternal prosperity. (Japan United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Massive Budget Proposed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi submitted a budget proposal to the Diet today, stating that the expenditures for Manchuria, emergency relief, exchange losses, and the large increase in national defense expenses caused by the international situation have resulted in a huge shortfall in the budget proposal. The increased expenses cannot be offset by tax revenues. All tax revenues, except for capital taxes, have increased. The total increase last year was 131 million yen. Next year's expenditures for Manchuria will total 163 million yen. Other expenditures are as follows: Emergency relief 125 million yen, Army 110 million yen, Navy 190 million yen, Foreign exchange losses 80 million yen, totaling 2,112 million yen for national expenditures. Since Japan's current economic situation is not suitable for increasing taxes, it is proposed to issue bonds of 881 million yen, which is a decrease of 131 million yen compared to the public bonds raised last year. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Diet Launches Questioning Offensive</h3>
<p>Tokonami Takes the Lead in Scourging the Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:33 PM today, as Finance Minister Takahashi finished his speech, Tokonami Takejiro of the Seiyukai immediately took the stage amidst applause, launching the first arrow of his questioning, intending to give the government a warning scourge. The gist of it is as follows: Since the current cabinet was formed, a year and a half has passed. Judging from its political achievements during this period, there is indeed room for various discussions, but in this autumn of national distress, it is necessary to acknowledge that it has passed through many difficulties. Secondly, a comprehensive review of the government's policies in diplomacy, finance, economy, industry, etc., especially in diplomatic relations, is intended to maintain Hirota's proposition and wish it success. Finally, he discussed parliamentary politics and opinions scourging the government as follows: If political parties can demonstrate their regeneration and improvement, the true face of parliamentary politics will surely be revealed. As for the current cabinet's policy direction, there is no established situation. Its enthusiasm and courage for the current situation are still lacking, and it has failed to exert its function as an organic entity. Many of us hold this feeling, which has become the main cause of political instability and public unrest. In this regard, I hope that the Prime Minister will pay special attention, exert his fearless spirit, implement his ambitions, and achieve decisive means. Since the Saito Cabinet was established based on this belief, it is necessary to explain the national policy to the people, which is what we believe is necessary. Please reply clearly as to what the government's will is on this matter.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Reply Was Evading the Core (Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito rose to reply, saying, "Thank you very much for your attention. The policy direction stated by the government is the preparation for future implementation. I fully agree with what Mr. Tokonami said."</p>
<p>Tobu Questions Rural Problems Next, Mr. Tobu of the Seiyukai took the stage and questioned the rural problems, especially focusing on the Rice Control Law, asking, "Does the government have the courage to implement rice monopoly?" He also said, "It is a pity to neglect the rural problem for the sake of national defense."</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto replied to Mr. Tobu's question, saying, "This year is expected to be a bumper harvest, so the implementation of the Rice Control Law still needs to be slightly considered, but there is no intention to revise it."</p>
<p>Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai also replied. Mr. Tobu questioned again. The meeting adjourned at 5:24 PM.</p>
<p>New Army Minister Attends the Upper House Today, the new Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro attended both the Upper and Lower Houses, and made a simple reply in the House of Peers, which attracted much attention because it was his first speech. (Japan United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Righteous Army Attacks Korean Territory</h3>
<p>Keijo: According to the Korean military authorities, at 11:30 PM on the 22nd of this month, 300 members of the Liaodong Righteous Army crossed the Yalu River and invaded a certain location in Pyonganbuk-do, Korea, attacking the Japanese troops guarding the border. The Japanese troops were defeated. By the time reinforcements arrived, the Righteous Army had obtained ammunition and retreated to their original location. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Nepal Earthquake</h3>
<p>Thousands Dead or Injured, Trains Still Not Running</p>
<p>Calcutta: The extent of the damage from the recent earthquake in Nepal is now becoming clear. It is feared that thousands of people have died or been injured. In the three major cities, such as Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhadgaon, many houses have collapsed. The Nepalese government railway has also been greatly damaged, and trains have not yet resumed operations. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>New Wine in Old Bottles: Hayashi Senjuro Assumes the Post of Army Minister</h3>
<p>Reminding Saito Makoto to Pay Attention to Two Points: Resolving to Implement the Strong Hardline Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army General Hayashi Senjuro, Inspector General of Military Education, entered the Imperial Palace at 9:00 AM this morning. In the presence of Prime Minister Saito, he was appointed to the position of Minister of the Army. After taking office, General Hayashi made a statement to the Japanese press corps, saying that he would devote all his efforts to realizing all the plans planned by Army Minister Araki during his tenure, as his mission to take the post of Army Minister. (China United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Hayashi, the new Army Minister, agreed to take the post of Army Minister, although he did not attach any other conditions to Prime Minister Saito, he reminded the Prime Minister to pay attention to the following two points: (1) All the matters promoted by former Army Minister Araki were based on the consensus within the Army Department, and I am determined to inherit and realize all of them. Please remember this point in advance. (2) It is heard that the current cabinet has some doubts about both domestic and foreign policies, but the crisis of 1935 is imminent, which is regrettable. I hope you will pay more attention to this point. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Young Military Officers Unanimously Support</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The trend of the army after General Hayashi took office as the new Army Minister seems to be following the fundamental policies of former Army Minister Araki, that is, the army will not be re-selected, except for the regular changes in March to August. The new Army Minister Hayashi has the same honest, upright, fair, and selfless character as former Army Minister Araki, and also has the decisiveness that former Army Minister Araki lacked. The trust of young officers is gradually increasing, so the attitude of the military department will not be eased due to the resignation of Army Minister Araki. Its hardline policy will remain unchanged. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>First New Move to Refresh the Military Department</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of changing the Vice Minister and Bureau Chiefs of the Army Department after the Army Minister's change will not be realized immediately because the Diet is currently in session. Furthermore, the opinions of the new Army Minister Hayashi, General Araki, and the new Inspector General of Military Education Masaki on the implementation of national policy in an emergency situation have always been consistent. The Army Ministry also holds the same opinions on various policies, so Army Minister Hayashi seems to inherit General Araki's policies, but Army Minister Hayashi will definitely implement his flexible means in the issue of refreshing the army personnel. (Japan United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Observations Influencing the Political Situation</h3>
<p>One Says That From Now On, the Country Will Be Able to Purify the Anxious Air</p>
<p>Another Says That the Crisis of Conflict Between the Government and the Military Will Increase</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the change of the Army Minister, combining the opinions of the political parties, the people, and the Upper House, it is said that the Diet has a considerable aversion to the words and actions of former Army Minister Araki. On the issues of military discipline and budget, they were prepared to pursue them deeply. This sudden change of Army Minister has the feeling of being unexpected, so the Diet can maintain calmness. However, regarding the movement of the military department and the future of the political situation, there are the following two pessimistic and optimistic theories. Those who hold an optimistic view say that the faction represented by former Army Minister Araki has withdrawn from power, and the military's interference in politics is also not as good as before, so it can sweep away the atmosphere of political unrest. Those who hold a pessimistic view say that recently, the radical elements in the military department have gradually stopped supporting the Army Minister, and the demands within the department have gradually shifted to General Hayashi. Judging from this fact, in the future, the intentions of these radical elements can be expressed by Army Minister Hayashi. As a result, the crisis of conflict between the government and the military will increase. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Erudite General Masaki Succeeds as Inspector General of Military Education</h3>
<p>Araki is Reappointed as Military Councilor</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, after the ceremony of appointing the new Army Minister Hayashi in the Phoenix Room of the Imperial Palace, the appointment ceremony of General Masaki as Inspector General of Military Education and General Araki as Military Councilor was held simultaneously. Although General Masaki looks like a beardless, childish-looking country gentleman, he cannot be compared to a mere military man. He is the same age as Army Minister Hayashi, both 59 years old, and both are from Saga Prefecture, the same as the late Marshal Muto. He loves his subordinates very much and can be called a famous Inspector General of Military Education. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>British Empire Naval Conference Discusses the Pacific Situation</h3>
<p>Far East Fleet Generals Gather in Singapore to Prepare Defense of Territorial Security Plans</p>
<p>Singapore: The British Empire Naval Conference opened here today, with extreme secrecy. After Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota issued a declaration of self-defense, and the United States advocated building 120 new warships, the atmosphere is filled with uncertain signs. Representatives of the Navy, Army, and Air Force held an important preliminary meeting at the beginning of the month. This conference will have a far-reaching impact on British naval policy in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Singapore: The British Empire naval community is worried about the security of territories in the Far East. Generals of the Far East Fleet gathered in Singapore today to discuss the increasingly dangerous situation developing in the Pacific. Participants in the meeting included Vice Admiral Trelawny, Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Vice Admiral Nasmith, Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Fleet, Vice Admiral Hyde, Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Fleet, and Rear Admiral Waterhouse, Commander of the New Zealand Fleet. It is learned that the conference decisions will not be announced at all. Although military circles routinely deny that it has any significance, this is the first Imperial Conference in the Far East in five years, and it coincides with the new naval competition in the world. Since 1921, there has been no large-scale shipbuilding as much as today. According to statistics here, there are 30 powerful cruisers, 4 giant aircraft carriers, and several fleets of destroyers and submarines under construction. Japan and the United States are at the forefront of the competition. Britain has also been preparing its battleships and cruisers to the maximum extent in accordance with the tonnage stipulated in the Washington and London treaties.</p>
<p>According to British naval experts, recent developments in the Pacific are creating a situation similar to that of 1920 to 1921, when the Washington Treaty was signed to limit the accelerated naval competition between the United States and Japan. Since the two countries implemented the "Great Navy" plan, the British believe that the naval competition at that time has shown signs of re-emergence. Britain currently has two major problems, so it feels this development is particularly important. The first problem is the fierce commercial war between Britain and Japan, which has destroyed the spirit of the former Anglo-Japanese alliance. The second problem is the 1935 Naval Conference, where Japan has formally declared its intention to demand equality with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The recent situation in the Pacific has long caused concern in Australia. As early as October last year, Prime Minister Lyons and his predecessor Prime Minister Hughes repeatedly urged to re-examine the Imperial border defense plan. Hughes said, "Australia is the most vulnerable country in the world to the enemy, because it is separated from a certain country with an expanding population in Asia by a single voyage. Britain no longer holds maritime hegemony, and Japan is no longer our ally. Australia must prepare itself." (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>United States Navy Can Soon Dominate the World</h3>
<p>Plan to Build 121 Warships</p>
<p>Modernizing the Entire Navy</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Naval Budget Review Committee approved the Navy Department's budget proposal of 293,833,040 yuan and submitted it to the House of Representatives. As a result, President Roosevelt's plan for the world's strongest navy can be realized. At the same time, the Senate is also discussing Congressman Vinson's proposal. According to Vinson's proposal, the US Navy should build as many warships as possible in accordance with the naval conference limits. The current Navy Department budget plans to spend 1.8 million yuan to build one 8-inch gun cruiser and three 6-inch gun cruisers. After these four ships are built in January next year, the United States Navy will appropriately achieve the 5:5:3 ratio signed at the Washington and London Naval Conferences. The budget plans to add 1,800 naval soldiers, bringing the total number of the US Navy to 81,500, and plans to add 63 officers and 16,000 Marines. The budget also plans to allocate funds to add 142 naval aircraft, most of which are seaplanes. As for the 100 fighter planes recently purchased by the US Army for 7.5 million yuan, they are entirely for the Army and cannot be included in the naval budget. This budget amount is 23,221,533 yuan less than the Navy Department's annual expenses, and 1,585,148 yuan less than the budget estimate. The number of new ships added and repaired in this budget is quite large. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt told guests today that he strongly supports the Vinson Bill, which calls for the construction of 120 new warships at an estimated cost of 616.25 million yuan, saying that the United States can no longer be a model for disarmament elsewhere in the world. The White House's support for building warships in accordance with the treaty is based on the expectation that Japan will demand the same large navy as Britain and the United States when the current naval convention expires in 1936. Vinson is the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee and has agreed to work to get the bill passed as soon as possible at the request of the Secretary of the Navy. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) There is no doubt that the House of Representatives will pass the naval budget of 285 million yuan. The government plans to go a step further and approve the five-year naval construction plan proposed by the House Naval Affairs Committee, with an expenditure of 380 million yuan, distributed over five years at 75 million yuan per year. Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, is the drafter of this construction plan. He expects that Japan will demand that its navy be equal to that of Britain and the United States when the London Naval Treaty expires. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Standley, Commander of US Naval Tactics, today criticized the naval supply bill being reviewed by the House of Representatives and detailed the darkness of the US fleet, saying that while the latest US battleships should be modernized, the condition of other battleships is not satisfactory. As for the aircraft carriers Saratoga and Lexington, they have now degenerated materially. The situation of the destroyers is also very worrying. It is doubtful whether the destroyers can effectively perform their duties in wartime. The airship Los Angeles is no longer safe and may soon have to be dismantled. The naval supply bill requires 284,747,000 yuan, of which 33,619,000 yuan will be used to build new ships, including aircraft carriers and four cruisers. 18,880,000 yuan will be allocated to the naval air force, of which 6,131,000 yuan will be used to build new aircraft. As for the airship Akron, which crashed at sea last year, it is not planned to be rebuilt. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Famous Generals of the European War Discuss British-Dutch Naval Alliance</h3>
<p>Joint Defense of Far Eastern Territories; Japan's Issue a Great Worry for Britain</p>
<p>(London) The naval generals commanding the Australian Fleet, the New Zealand Fleet, and the British Empire's Far Eastern Fleet will begin a meeting today in Singapore Harbor to study appropriate methods for strengthening the British Empire's national defense. British General Allenby, a famous general of the European War, recently went to Java to consult with the Dutch authorities. In the event that British India, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and other places are invaded, the British and Dutch navies will jointly resist. According to several newspapers, General Allenby will also participate in the Singapore meeting after returning from Java. It can be seen that the matters discussed at this meeting are particularly important. Furthermore, the opening of the Singapore Naval Conference coincides with the resignation of Japanese Army Minister Araki and the declaration by Foreign Minister Hirota. Therefore, the British newspapers are paying close attention to the issue of Japan's expansion of power. The Daily Herald, a Labor Party newspaper, stated that according to Foreign Minister Hirota's speech, there is no doubt that Japan wants to conquer and control the entire China. Placing the vast territory of China under the oligarchy of Japan, with its politics dominated and its economy exploited, would undoubtedly cause repercussions throughout the world. Fortunately, the desire for power alone is not enough to accomplish anything; it must be followed by practical efforts. However, if Japan still wants to strive to realize its grand plan of Japanese imperialism, its failure is highly probable. Nevertheless, for the present, we must immediately declare to Foreign Minister Hirota that while Hirota expresses a willingness to obtain our cooperation, Japan cannot expect our enthusiastic cooperation in this aggressive undertaking. The Times, a Conservative Party newspaper, takes a more reserved attitude, but the newspaper concludes that the issue of Japan, after a period of temporary silence, has now become a major hidden concern for Britain. Foreign Minister Hirota's speech provides further proof of this. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>League of Nations to Discuss Tense German-Austrian Relations</h3>
<p>Austria Demands Germany Cease Disruptive Behavior</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations may soon have to deal with an event as serious as the Manchurian problem. Austria will invoke Articles 10 and 12 of the League of Nations Covenant, which concern territorial integrity and foreign aggression, to sue Germany in the League of Nations. Austria has sent a note to Germany demanding that it prohibit the continuous flow of arms, money, and propaganda across the border into Austria. Germany has not yet responded. If Germany does not provide a clear answer, Austria intends to appeal to the League of Nations for remedy. The Austrian Minister to Geneva recently consulted with French representative Paul-Boncour and Italian representative Aloisi about this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vienna An executive of the Austrian National Socialist Party announced via radio that the struggle between the Dollfuss government and National Socialism is nearing its end. The National Socialist Party will surely be victorious; the trend is set, and only the result remains to be awaited.</p>
<p>Vienna Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss delivered another speech criticizing National Socialism in Austria and asking good citizens to fully cooperate with the government. He also stated that patience will be seen as weakness. Tens of thousands of Austrian citizens have now risen up to fight against National Socialism, and many more will follow to defend the country.

<p>(Hankou) A major fire broke out on Parrot Island in Hanyang on the 23rd, burning down more than 500 houses. Many people were injured, and more than 2,000 victims were left homeless.

<h3>Little Entente Conference</h3>
<p>Unanimous Agreement on Recognizing Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Decision on Balkan Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Bulgaria Notifies of Temporary Non-Accession</p>
<p>Zagreb, Yugoslavia The foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries held a meeting here and achieved very good results in just one day. According to a public statement, the foreign ministers' opinions were completely consistent. It was also stated that the foreign ministers have already adopted various decisions, but what exactly was decided was not clearly stated. This is because the evolution of the situation is extremely far-reaching, and the foreign ministers cannot help but speak cautiously in order to retain greater freedom of action. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu had consulted with Greek Foreign Minister Maximos in Geneva on the Balkan Non-Aggression Pact. According to reliable sources, Bulgaria has notified the Little Entente foreign ministers' meeting that it will not join the Balkan Non-Aggression Pact for the time being. Therefore, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Turkey will sign the agreement first. If Bulgaria wishes to join later, it will be allowed to do so. The public statement did not mention Russia at all because the three foreign ministers had already agreed on the recognition of Soviet Russia before the meeting, and only the procedural issues remained to be discussed. In addition, the Little Entente foreign ministers' meeting also decided to organize propaganda to resist the proposal to revise the peace treaty. Furthermore, the Little Entente Economic Conference held in Prague previously made various decisions regarding economic cooperation among the Little Entente countries. These decisions have now been approved by the foreign ministers' meeting, and the improvement of economic relations among the Little Entente countries has thus become a reality.

<p>Zagreb, Yugoslavia A fast train traveling between Berlin, Vienna, Zagreb, and the Yugoslav capital was near the Austrian city of Land when a bomb exploded in a first-class car. Five passengers were killed and one was seriously injured. Yesterday's telegram reported that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš were traveling on this train from Geneva, but the special car in which they were traveling had already passed Land long before the bomb exploded. It has now been determined that the bomb was placed in the car while the train was in Yugoslav territory. Whether the intention was to harm the foreign ministers of Romania and the Czech Republic, to show hostility towards the Little Entente countries, or to be a demonstration by a political exile is a question that everyone is asking. Last night, the foreign ministers of the three Little Entente countries already held talks on the train. This morning at 11:00, the first formal meeting was held at the local provincial governor's office. In the evening, there was another meeting. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that the foreign ministers of the three countries had discussed the issues of general disarmament, the Balkan Pact, and the relations between the Little Entente countries and their neighbors, especially with the Soviet Union. As a result, their opinions were completely consistent. The three countries believed that the movement to revise the peace treaty would cause ominous effects and decided to explain this to make people aware of it. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Zagreb, Yugoslavia The Little Entente Conference officially opened here at noon today, but the foreign ministers of the three related countries held a preliminary meeting last night, which did not end until 3:00 this morning. The Yugoslav ambassador to Austria also arrived here today. Although he claimed that he had no formal mission, it is generally believed that his trip was to report to the conference on the visit of Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich to Vienna, as the Austrian issue is actually one of the most important aspects of this Little Entente Conference. It is also heard that it is feared that there will hardly be any concrete resolutions on any important issues at this conference, as the European situation has been changing a lot recently. Therefore, important matters can only be discussed and not dealt with for the time being. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Talks at an Impasse; Germany Asks Britain to Mediate</h3>
<p>To Propose a Compromise Solution Between France and Germany</p>
<p>British Government to Consider in Cabinet Meeting Today</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government has recently sent another official document to the British government, requesting the British government to put forward new suggestions in the hope of finding a compromise solution between the French memorandum and the Berlin reply. Britain originally decided to temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude towards the Franco-German negotiations before clarifying the German reply. Now that Germany has put forward this new official document, it has requested Britain to come forward to mediate before Britain has prepared any action. However, Germany's original views remain unchanged, and British political figures are not very satisfied with this. There have already been informal expressions of this. Therefore, Britain's assumption of mediation is not as easy as people generally imagine. While Germans in London have denied that their country has put forward a new official document, British public opinion is quite in favor of coming forward to mediate. Therefore, the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday will consider whether mediation can be realized. As for what the Observer reported yesterday, that the British government is preparing to put forward concrete suggestions on the number of land, sea, and air forces that each country can maintain, according to well-informed sources, this is completely inaccurate. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, the presidential palace held a State Council meeting. Because Germany's reply to the French memorandum relates to national defense, it was handed over to the three ministers of the army, navy, and air force for separate review. No further discussion was held. It is planned to make a calculation after each department has separately expressed its opinions on the technical aspects. Germany's reply continues to demand equal rights to armaments, regardless of the number of troops or military equipment, and that it must be implemented immediately. It also stated that Germany still believes that the French suggestion to reduce the French air force by 50% under certain conditions is not a sufficiently satisfactory concession, because Germany itself has no air force. It is generally believed here that although Germany's tough stance makes it impossible for countries to have any real hope of disarmament, it is also possible to establish a general convention stipulating that each country's armaments should be limited to the current number and that no further increase should be allowed. It is said that this idea was advocated by Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, the general rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference. In addition, the British Cabinet will hold a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to put forward a compromise proposal again in accordance with Germany's request. At that time, the decision made by the British government may affect Germany's attitude. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Major Riot in Paris; Another Huge Fraud Case in France</h3>
<p>The Government of Doumergue Shaken Greatly</p>
<p>(Paris) The life of the French government is now in danger again, as a new case similar to the Bayonne affair has been discovered. The old case involved counterfeit bonds with a face value of approximately 6 million pounds, sold to the public by Stavisky, who recently committed suicide. The central figure in the new case is a bank founder and Prime Minister Alexandre, who is accused of defrauding no less than 2.5 million pounds. He was arrested today. The public's anger is unstoppable, because he has been the subject of much discussion for four years, and only today has he been arrested for questioning. It is feared in several quarters that the new case will seriously endanger the existence of the government. Many high-ranking officials with medals were involved in the affairs of Alexandre's companies. According to various newspapers, Alexandre, who started out selling clothes in Rouen, has shown considerable talent in the financial world. He was the subject of a report by the public prosecutor in 1930, and he should have been arrested at that time, but he relied on huge sums of money to influence police officers and was able to get away with it. Today, disturbances broke out again in front of the Chamber of Deputies, and the police stopped them with stern measures. Therefore, the public's resentment towards the police is even deeper. The public's demonstrations after the Bayonne affair were also suppressed by police violence, injuring many people, and they have not yet forgotten this pain. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Serious riots broke out again in front of the National Assembly on Monday night, as royalists attacked the police, and the police retaliated with batons. Several members of parliament and journalists were squeezed into the crowd and were beaten mercilessly during the commotion, unable to distinguish between the two sides. About 700 people were arrested. By midnight, only a few had been released. In the hallway of the Ministry of Justice, Radical Party member of parliament Haysay, as well as dozens of other lawyers, had a conflict with a secretary of Minister of Public Education Munchy for unknown reasons after advocating for lawyer Chermidde German cheek. The Young Lawyers Association held a meeting and passed a resolution advocating that the lawyers accused in the Stavisky case should be dealt with according to a very strict plan. At the same time, Prime Minister Doumergue is still fighting hard, and in order to appease public anger, he has announced the dismissal of several senior police officers. Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tessan has also sued two bankers for misappropriating public funds. Their names have not yet been announced. The head of the Paris police department, Chappe, has also been implicated in the Stavisky case, but the entire Paris police force has voted to express its trust in Chappe. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since investigating the Bayonne public bond fraud case, Prime Minister Doumergue has taken prompt measures to rectify officialdom. He has ordered the dismissal of Gicquel, the head of the Judicial Section of the Paris Police Department, who has reached retirement age. In addition, he has ordered two senior police officers to be suspended and ordered two other officers to provide written explanations for their actions. Inspector General Ducros of the General Police Department has also been suspended. Doumergue will submit a bill to the National Assembly today to reform the police administration.

<h3>US to Start Minting Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Treasury Department told reporters today that the mint will start minting silver dollars after collecting a large amount of silver. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Wheeler announced today after meeting with the President that he will propose an amendment to the currency bill, advocating the restoration of silver coins. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Black stated that the Federal Reserve Bank is willing to fully cooperate with the government in financial procedures. Professor Rogers, one of President Roosevelt's most trusted advisors, who usually studies gold and its related issues, now estimates that President Roosevelt's dollar devaluation plan can allow credit expansion to reach $1.75 billion. Professor Rogers is a strong supporter of managed currency and once referred to the gold standard as the most conspicuous deformity of modern civilization. Professor Rogers said today that unrestrained credit expansion will soon follow the continued rise in prices, but if the profits from the dollar devaluation are used to control it, it is not impossible to limit it. Young, famous for the Young Plan, issued a warning, believing that dollar devaluation would trigger a credit expansion of 3 to 4 billion dollars. He advocated that various amendments should be made to the currency bill, such as limiting the effective period of this bill to the current emergency period, that ownership of gold should still belong to the Federal Reserve Bank, and that gold bonds should be redeemed in gold bars. Young stated that otherwise, he does not believe that the stability of currency exchange rates can be restored. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Entire Mutiny of Hu Xie's Fifth Unit of the Security Team in Yutian County</h3>
<p>Hebei Plans to Use Peaceful Means to Urge Them to Submit</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng Has Arrived There to Handle Matters</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the mutiny of Hu Xie's Fifth Unit of the Security Team in Yutian County, it has become increasingly serious in recent days. The unit, totaling more than 1,000 people, has mutinied in full. Yu Xuezhong reported this in a telegram yesterday and agreed to first use peaceful means to urge them to submit as soon as possible, and then determine a solution. If the unit refuses to obey, a fundamental solution will be determined separately. Yin Rugeng and Section Chief Li Yuming, sent by Yu Xuezhong, have arrived in Yutian to carry out a preliminary peaceful resolution. A proper plan for the aftermath will be carefully considered after Yin and Li return. According to those who came to Beiping from Yutian, the mutiny of the security team was indeed an organized action. Therefore, after the mutiny, the unit internally produced many organized personnel responsible for commanding. Although County Chief Dong Zihua mobilized the militia of various counties to encircle and suppress them, the militia's strength is weak, so it is difficult to cope with the conflict with the organized security team. If necessary, crack troops will be dispatched to suppress them. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The mutinous soldiers in Yutian are still holding on to Yazhen. In addition to installing heavy artillery at the four gates, they have also dug trenches around the town for strong defenses. Although the militia of various counties have cooperated in the attack, they have not succeeded. However, the mutinous soldiers believe that the militia's strength is strong, and part of them have fled to the territory of Fengrun County and are engaged in fierce fighting with the militia. The bandits have suffered heavy casualties. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Chahar East Carry Out Military Construction</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the 13th of this month, a road protection movement was held on the fake Fengshan Road. Specially issued Japanese-puppet flags were hung on the high tower of Yuguan Station, pine branch arches, and the storefronts of shops. Road protection slogans were also posted. The Japanese army is building fortresses and bunkers at various passes along the Great Wall and at key points in eastern Chahar, and radio stations have also been erected. Small-scale temporary barracks are also being built near the fortresses. The automobile roads connecting various passes of the Great Wall are also being actively repaired, and it is planned that they will be completed one after another by April of this year. In addition to stationing troops and setting up works at various passes of the Great Wall and in various key areas along the border of eastern Chahar, the Japanese have also set up special police and tax bureaus in the streets and cities of each pass, specializing in collecting import and export goods taxes and inspecting travelers in and out of the passes. The Japanese-puppet army stationed in Heihe is now planning to build a highway from Heihe to Yongningzhen and is enlisting more than 2,000 laborers on the border between Rehe and Chahar in preparation for starting construction. The highway from Guyuan Heidiaying to Dagezhen has been completed. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attended the Plenary Session in the Same Car as Chiang</p>
<p>The Position to be Assigned Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Wang Shuchang, Wan Guobin, Bao Wenxue, Tang Guozhen, Tan Hai, Xia Pu, and Vice-Adjutants Wang and Liu, arrived at Xiaguan Station at 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd.

After talking for a quarter of an hour, Zhang went to Chiang's private residence behind the military academy to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang. He then went with Chiang to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. At 2:00 p.m., he went to Shibanqiao to visit Chairman Lin. At 3:00 p.m., Chairman Lin went to the Lixingshe to return the visit, but Zhang was out and they did not meet. Zhang was invited to dinner by President Wang in the evening and did not go to Minister Kong's residence in Tie Tangchi until about 9:00 p.m., where he stayed. A reception office was set up in the Lixingshe to facilitate all contacts. According to Zhang, speaking to people at the Lixingshe, (1) I came here to pay my respects to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and President Wang, etc. It has been a long time since we last met, and I am eager to have a chat. (2) It is rumored that the Central Government will appoint me to an important position. I have heard nothing about this. If the Central Government has an order, I will not refuse. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhang Xueliang and Huang Xuchu arrived in Nanjing by overnight train from Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. on the 23rd. Zhang attached a flower car to the train. Wang Shuchang, Bao Wenxue, Tang Guozhen, Tan Hai, and other entourage also came.

At that time, committee members such as Lin and Wang had already arrived at the meeting place, and the meeting had already begun. When Chiang and others arrived, the committee members stood up to welcome them. According to what Zhang told the Central News Agency reporter at the Lixingshe, I came here to attend the plenary session and meet with Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and the central committee members. I have no personal proposals. It is inaccurate to say that I went to Hangzhou to pay my respects to Chiang a few days ago. Whether the Central Government will give me any position has not yet been determined. I have no preconceived ideas. As for the saying that I will return to North China, that is definitely not true.

<h3>Sui Committee Plans to Determine Fujian Province Highway Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Bandit disasters have not been quelled in Fujian Province in recent years, and transportation construction has been unable to proceed, especially in northern Fujian. During the recent Fujian Rebellion, the central government's army felt that the roads were rugged. Now that the military affairs are over, highway construction in Fujian Province is a matter of urgent importance. Now, the National Economic Council plans to formulate a plan to open up highways in Fujian Province. The first step is to build the Pucheng-Zhangzhou Highway, starting from Pucheng, passing through Yanping, and ending in Zhangzhou. The required funds will be allocated from the US wheat loan. According to a member of the council, the method for building the Pucheng-Zhangzhou Highway in Fujian Province will be implemented after it is submitted and passed by the third standing committee meeting to be held within days.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhizhong previously went from Nanjing to the front lines to participate in the military affairs of suppressing the rebellion. Now that the Fujian Rebellion is about to end, it is not appropriate to leave the educational affairs of the military academy vacant for a long time.

<h3>The Economic Committee Will Soon Convene in Beijing</h3>
<p>Discussing the Two-Year Construction Plan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The first regular meeting of the Economic Committee was originally scheduled for the end of the year. However, due to the three standing committee members, Chiang, Soong, and Kung, residing separately in Shanghai and Jiangxi, and each being occupied with important affairs, they were unable to attend in Beijing as planned. Therefore, the meeting was postponed until now. Taking advantage of the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session, all standing committee members and committee members have gathered in Beijing. It has been decided to hold the meeting after the Plenary Session concludes. In recent days, the staff of the committee have been busy with preparations and compiling various plans and proposals to be submitted for discussion at the meeting. According to the opinions of the standing committee members, the meeting is scheduled to begin on the 26th of this month. Following the Standing Committee meeting, the first plenary committee meeting will be convened. Alternatively, the plenary committee meeting may be held first, followed by the regular meeting, depending on the circumstances at the time. The key points for discussion this time include deciding on the allocation of American cotton and wheat loans requested by various parties, the establishment dates for the Jiangxi and Northwest offices, and the election of the yet-to-be-established regulatory committees. Emphasis will also be placed on the implementation methods of the two-year construction plan. This plan was drafted by the Highway Administration, with a budget of 25 million yuan. The content of the plan has also been expanded. Excluding construction costs for water conservancy and other projects, the budget for highways alone has been increased to 30 million yuan, all of which will be allocated from American cotton and wheat loans. The reason for the expansion of the plan is that at the beginning of the drafting process, the Fujian rebellion had not yet been quelled. Now that it has been gradually suppressed, the highways and various transportation construction projects in Fujian Province have been re-added, and the content of the plan is very extensive. With the exception of the northeastern provinces, all other provinces are included. Once approved, the entire plan will be announced. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of a Certain Foreigner's Drug Trafficking in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Selling Drugs Deep into the People</p>
<p>Worth More Than 200,000 Yuan in One Year</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Heroin is ten times more potent than opium. In recent years, it has spread rampantly in various provinces of North China. Shandong, being a coastal province, has easy access to drug sources, making it particularly easy to penetrate the people. The provincial government has strictly ordered a crackdown and established addiction treatment centers. First-time offenders are forced to enter the center for addiction treatment. After being cured and released, their arms are tattooed to leave a permanent mark. Repeat offenders will be killed without pardon. In Jinan, the population is 400,000, but the residents live close together, with numerous police posts, making inspection easier. The atmosphere of drugs has not yet fully developed. However, the spread of drugs in the countryside is truly alarming. According to investigations, many foreign merchants along the Jiaoji Railway sell drugs wherever they go. All storefronts with the names "So-and-so Foreign Firm" or "So-and-so Pharmacy" are sources of drugs. East of Weixian, there is Huangqibao, a small place with only a few hundred households, which is extremely desolate. However, because it is close to the train station and is located at the intersection of Weixian, Changi, and Anqiu counties, transportation is still convenient. Several foreign merchants there sell drugs as an open secret, guaranteeing transportation and supplying the needs of nearby counties. In the past, people served tea to guests. Now, in addition to tea, they also offer drugs. This is necessary to show respect. They inhale wildly, feeling relaxed and happy. They even carry it with them while working in the fields, without any sense of shame. Even bandits demand drugs as ransom. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. Rural areas are sparsely populated, making it difficult to conduct thorough inspections. Moreover, sellers and transporters are protected by foreigners. Although everyone knows, no one dares to do anything. Only Wang Honglie, the magistrate of Anqiu County, has enforced the crackdown more strictly. The drug situation in that county is lighter than elsewhere. It is reported that last year, villagers in Huangqibao held a theatrical performance to worship the gods for five days. Spectators from all directions gathered, and the sales of heroin surged. The daily transactions were constantly in the thousands of yuan. After the five days were over, the foreign merchants even funded the continuation of the performance for two more days in order to sell more drugs. It is estimated that from spring to winter last year, the money remitted by foreigners through post offices and other places, where the amounts were verifiable, reached more than 240,000 yuan. The amounts are unknown for larger stations and cities, which are hundreds or thousands of times more. They are all using drugs to harm our nation, while they reap huge profits from it.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Guangdong-Guizhou Alliance</h3>
<p>The Panjiang Conference First United the Internal Guizhou Army</p>
<p>The Nanzhai Conference Further Negotiated Between Guangxi and Guizhou</p>
<p>Scheduled Nanning Conference to Cope with the Situation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent times, the southwestern provinces have been paying close attention to contact with Guizhou Province in order to unite internally and seek development of mutual interests. Wang Jialie of Guizhou was originally a pro-southwestern element. However, Mao Guangxiang, Jiang Zaizhen, You Guocai, and others in Guizhou obstructed him, causing civil wars to break out in Guizhou. Wang Jialie was unable to attend to internal affairs, resulting in a failure to connect with Guangdong and Guangxi. Guangxi Province, being adjacent to Guizhou Province, was particularly concerned about Guizhou's internal affairs compared to other parties, and had jointly initiated a mediation of Guizhou's disputes with representatives from Yunnan Province, promoting Guizhou's unification, strengthening the southwestern unity, in order to cope with the situation. At the end of last month, Long Jiezhi, the representative of Guangxi, along with Fu Chuncao, the representative of Sichuan, Gan Jiayi, the representative of Guangdong, and Dan Maoxin, the representative of Yunnan, strongly mediated Wang Jialie and You Guocai, and both sides convened two peace conferences in Panjiang, Guizhou Province, setting the following conditions: (1) Wang Jialie would telegraph the central government, commissioning You Guocai as the Commander of Qingxiang in Guizhou Province, allocating eight districts of Panjiang as You's stationed territory. The taxes and levies in the area would be collected by You to cover military expenses. If it was still insufficient, Wang Jialie would provide appropriate subsidies. In the future, they would not fight each other with weapons. (2) Che Mingyi's department would be reorganized by Chen Yuwu, appointing Chen as a division commander. The departments of Lei Mingjiu and Yang Qichang would all be under Chen's control, designating Fenghuang and Tongren counties as their garrison area. (3) Jiang Zaizhen's department would be designated to be stationed in Zheng'an and Yanhe, under the control of Deputy Commander Hou Zhidan. In the future, Chen Yuwu and Che Mingyi of the Eastern Route, You Guocai of the Western Route, and Jiang Zaizhen of the Northern Route would all be under the command of Wang Jialie of the 25th Army. Wang Jialie would still be in charge of Guizhou's administration. It is heard that the above matters have been signed by all parties, and the representatives of the various provinces have also left Panjiang. The internal situation in Guizhou has temporarily become consistent. Wang Jialie, in order to further contact Guangxi Province to discuss various issues, had an appointment to meet Li Zongren in Nanzhai County, on the border of Guizhou and Guangxi. On the 10th of this month, Wang left Guiyang with eighty guards, driving directly to Nanzhai. Those travelling with him included Zheng Shao Cheng, the head of the Finance Department of Guizhou Province, Secretary General Li Wei Bai, and Xiong Guan Ying, the head of the Guizhou Highway Department. Li Zongren then went with Zhang Yun Liang, the representative of Guizhou and Chief of Staff of the Guangxi Army, as well as Shi Fang Bai and others. After Wang and Li met, they stayed at the Nanzhai County Government. It is reported that as a result of the consultation, there were concrete plans for the future transportation and economy of the two provinces of Guizhou and Guangxi, and the practical connection between Guizhou and Guangdong. On the 12th, Wang and Li bid farewell. Li Zongren took the road through Nandan, Hechi, Yishan, Binyang, and returned to Nanning. After Li returned to Nanning, he recently convened a formal meeting of several southwestern provinces in Nanning to seek the great unity of the southwest, to discuss consistent strategies to cope with the situation, and to jointly issue consistent proposals. A telegram has been sent to Wang Jialie, Mao Guangxiang, Jiang Zaizhen, You Guocai, and Che Mingyi of Guizhou Province, as well as representatives from Yunnan and Sichuan, inviting them to participate. It is heard that Wang of Guizhou has departed from Guiyang on the 15th, the generals Jiang You Che have recommended Mao Guangxiang to attend as a representative, and Mao also took the first step from Chishui to Yong on the 15th. Lu Song, who resides in Guangzhou, also rushed to Guangxi to participate the day before yesterday. The Southwest Political Affairs Association received a telegram from Li Zongren yesterday, reporting on the purpose and date of the meeting, and immediately replied to Li Zongren, instructing Li to attend as a permanent member of the Southwest Political Affairs Association. It is heard that the Nanning meeting will open around the 22nd of this month. (January 18)</p>

<h3>Cold Weather and Frozen Ice Disrupt Traffic</h3>
<p>The weather has been severely cold in recent days. The indoor temperature has dropped to around 30 degrees. Water drips turn into ice. The day before yesterday, coupled with the howling north wind, the rivers in the city and countryside were completely frozen. Steamboats under the Gongyun Bridge, such as the Tongfeng of the Yangxian Company, the Yixing steamer, and the Huaxin and Yufeng steamers of the Yonggu Company, which travel to Yili, all sailed to Shuanghejian and then returned due to the ice. The other steamers operating routes to Fangqiao, Zhou Tieqiao, and Gushan also returned halfway. Only the steamers operating routes to Suzhou and Changshu were able to pass by breaking the ice, as the ice was slightly thinner along the way. The smaller steamers in the countryside were mostly suspended. Luggage piled up like mountains at the steamboat wharves, making it difficult for passengers to move forward or backward. However, passengers traveling from the city to Luoshe and Shitangwan all changed to trains. The various merchants in the city have also been greatly affected by the suspension of shipping.</p>

<h3>Kidnapped Hostage from Suzhou Rescued in Changzhou</h3>
<p>The home of Shen Chunjiang, a villager near Xiaoxi Town outside the Loumen Gate of Suzhou, was recently robbed. Shen's son, Gengsheng, was also kidnapped. The hostage was then hidden on a small boat, which sailed to Guanghua Bridge outside the Xiaonanmen Gate of Changzhou. On the morning of the 22nd, a river patrol noticed that the situation was suspicious and reported it to the Nanyunzhen Patrol Team and the Second Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. They went to investigate and apprehend the suspects. The hostage was rescued, and Hua Aquan, a bandit who was guarding the hostage, was captured, along with a handgun, a knife, and other items. It was later discovered that a coal ship was also involved in the case. Police were dispatched to search and capture Wang Ayun, Wang Yunlin, Li Zhiyou, and Xu Xiande, among others, who were taken to the station and detained. Li Haokang, a patrol officer at the Second Police Station, also learned that the bandits had been negotiating a ransom in Shanghai.

<h3>The Municipal Government Agreed to Reduce the Land Transfer Tax for Land Transactions</h3>
<p>Changed to Collecting Two Percent of the Original Tax Amount</p>
<p>The North-South Land Value Tax is Limited to Clearance in February</p>
<p>The Fahua and Pusong Districts Will Begin Collection on March 1st</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency Reports: Regarding the transfer tax that should be levied on land transactions in this city, the fixed amount is very large. The municipal government authorities had once reduced it to ease the burden on property owners. Since the formal collection of the city's land value tax began on December 20 last year, in order to tighten the prosperity of land, the original amount of the transfer tax has been specially reduced again. The method of conforming to the reduction standard has now been agreed upon and implemented by the Finance and Land Bureaus. The land owners in the South Shanghai and Zhabei areas are actively paying land value tax. The Fahua and Pusong districts are scheduled to start collection on March 1st. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reducing the Transfer Tax</h3>
<p>The land transaction transfer tax is also one of the municipal tax revenues. The fixed tax amount is very large. In addition to collecting nine percent of the current price as tax, there is an additional one percent for transfer fees, one percent for special construction donations, five percent for municipal expenses, two percent for land protection stamping fees, three percent for intermediary fees, and two percent for handling fees, totaling about 20 percent of the current price. In 1931, the municipal government authorities had once exempted all the construction special donations, transfer fees, municipal expenses, handling fees, and other fees added to the transfer tax. Only the transfer tax was implemented in the city treasury, and it was also changed to eight percent at the same time. However, the form alone incurs a handling fee of one percent due to the contract procedures, totaling nine percent levied on the current price. Since the north and south districts formally started to collect the estimated land value tax on December 20 last year, in order to prosper the land, the municipal government specially ordered the Finance and Land Bureaus to discuss and decide on methods suitable for reducing the standard, based on Article 11 of the Provisional Rules for the City Land Value Tax. According to Dagon News Agency reporters, the transfer tax has been formulated by the two bureaus. For land transfer tax in the three regions of land value tax collection, two percent of the current price will be collected, which is 7.6 percent lighter than the previous tax amount, that is, compared with the transfer tax outside the land value tax area, it is also reduced by three-quarters.</p>
<h3>Land Value Tax Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>The land owners in South Shanghai, from Block 1 to Block 8, and in Zhabei, Blocks 1 and 2, after the valuation committee estimated the value of the land reported by the owners and determined the tax rate, were formally opened for collection by the Finance Bureau's instructions to the South Shanghai and Zhabei tax collection offices on December 20 last year. Up to now, for a month, the land owners in each block have been actively going to pay the land value tax in accordance with the assessment with the land business license and the tax payment notice. The total has reached six out of ten.</p>
<h3>Fahua and Pusong to Begin Collection</h3>
<p>The city land bureau is continuing to collect the land value tax in the Fahua and Pusong districts. The investigation of the Fahua district has been completed, and the Pusong district has also begun. Each block that has been investigated has notified the owners to report the land value automatically from January 11 to February 10 this year. After preliminary assessment, it will be submitted to the Land Valuation Committee for review and then sent to the Finance Bureau for joint announcement of collection. Therefore, the land value tax in the Fahua and Pusong districts has been set to be implemented on March 1st.</p>

<h3>Japanese Espionage in the Northwest: Eurasia Aviation Corporation Ordered to Take Precautions</h3>
<p>No New Discoveries After Previous Detention</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Japanese occupied our Northeast, they have recently instigated Puyi to declare himself emperor and are now deploying troops to spy on the west. Their ambition has been fully exposed and has not diminished at all. Since the recent unrest, there have been daily reports of Japanese agents infiltrating key areas in the Northwest to spy. Some have even disguised themselves and traveled on Eurasia Aviation Corporation planes to Gansu, and then proceeded to Xinjiang. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, recognizing the immense implications of this matter for national defense, visited the corporation's Secretary Zha yesterday to inquire about the situation. According to him, recently, no Japanese nationals have been discovered using the company's planes to travel to the Northwest. The only case was a Japanese national introduced by a commissioner from a certain agency, who was</p>
<p>inspected and detained by Chairman Zhu (Shaoliang). He has not been seen again since. Although there are rumors circulating outside, they definitely do not involve travel on this</p>
<p>company's planes. However, because this company is engaged in commercial operations, there have been no restrictions on the nationality of passengers. But since the previous incident of a Japanese national secretly traveling to the Northwest to take photos of the interior, the Ministry of Communications has reiterated a strict ban. Regardless of nationality, all passengers disembarking at any of the company's stations must be subject to inspection by local military and police authorities to prevent any improper actions that could harm our national defense. At the same time, passengers must provide accurate names,</p>
<p>addresses, and telephone numbers when purchasing tickets for verification purposes. In fact, the precautions are already extremely strict.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Revised Plans for Geng款 Shipbuilding Program: Redetermining Construction Plans for Jianghai Vessels</h3>
<p>Revised Hull Length for the "Sihai" Vessels</p>
<p>Orders to Commissioners in England to Re-tender Bids</p>
<p>Decision to Build Two of the Three "Changjiang" Vessels First</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, using the British Boxer Indemnity funds to build four ocean-going vessels and three river vessels, had already held bidding processes in both London and Shanghai. However, due to the high cost of the ocean-going vessels, which far exceeded the budget, the entire shipbuilding plan underwent significant changes. Not only was the ocean-going vessel project halted, but the river vessel construction could not proceed according to the original plan. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Recently, the company, along with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, has repeatedly consulted with and petitioned the Ministry of Communications, exchanging letters and telegrams and holding meetings to find remedial measures. A revised plan has finally been agreed upon. The key points of the situation</p>
<p>are summarized below:</p>
<h3>Negotiating Ocean-Going Vessel Costs</h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company appointed Wu Daming and Shi Gan to London, a bidding process was held for the "Sihai" vessels. As a result, the lowest bid for each vessel was 90,000 British pounds, which was 25,000 pounds higher than the company's budget. Each vessel would cost 400,000 yuan, and four vessels would exceed 1.6 million yuan, which would jeopardize the funding for the river vessels as well. This has been raised at several board meetings this month for discussion. After deliberation by the heads of each department, it was decided that due to the loan agreement, the vessels must be built in England and cannot be constructed at shipyards in other countries. However, the excessively high price of the vessels was deemed uneconomical. Therefore, the Ministry was consulted, and the company decided to cable Wu and Shi in London, instructing them not to sign the new vessel bids for the time being, pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Boxer Indemnity Board's Inquiry</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has the right to advise on shipbuilding bids. After Wu and Shi telegraphed the total cost to the head office, the Board of Trustees also repeatedly inquired from the company whether to proceed with the construction. Liu Hongsheng believed that the bid price for the four vessels was one-quarter higher than the budget. If the vessels were constructed at this price, the three river vessels would be entirely scrapped, which would deviate significantly from the original plan. Therefore, he replied to the Board of Trustees that the cost of the four new vessels required careful consideration and that construction would proceed after a decision was made.</p>
<h3>Re-tendering Bids</h3>
<p>The company submitted a report to the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Communications regarding the cost of the "Sihai" vessels, requesting guidance on how to proceed. The shipbuilding department also had the bid documents sent from London reviewed by Department Heads Zhao and Zhou. After a detailed examination, it was found that the vessel length listed in the bids from England was 340 feet, which did not match the company's proposed dimensions. Therefore, the company will provide more detailed specifications for the vessel's size, tonnage, draft, etc., to Wu and Shi in England, instructing them to re-tender bids in England to ensure that they meet the budget.</p>
<h3>Building Two River Vessels First</h3>
<p>The remaining funds from the Boxer Indemnity, according to the original budget, would allow for an additional 140,000 pounds, which was earmarked for the construction of three Yangtze River vessels. Bids had already been invited in Shanghai, with plans for the Jiangnan Shipyard to build the hulls and the engines to be shipped from England. Now, due to the higher-than-budgeted cost of the "Sihai" vessels, the three river vessels have also been affected. The company has submitted a report to the Ministry requesting instructions on how to proceed. A reply has now been received from the Ministry, instructing that, regarding the construction of the river vessels in Shanghai, the shipyard should be contacted to build two vessels first. The engines, materials, and the four "Sihai" vessels should wait until a second round of bidding in England is held, and the prices are determined before raising funds to cover the deficit. Therefore, the company has decided to proceed with ordering two Yangtze River vessels in Shanghai first, and the Jiangnan Shipyard has sent representatives to the company to negotiate the construction procedures.</p>
<h3>Taihu Water Conservancy Association Announces Songjiang Dredging Plan</h3>
<p>Estimated Cost of 2.14 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Commission's proposal to request an allocation of cotton and wheat loans to dredge the Wusong River to benefit commerce and agriculture has been reported previously. The Xin Sheng News Agency has learned that the commission, based on the actual survey charts of the former Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Project Office, the former Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, as well as the Construction Committee's decision to dredge the Wusong River, has released the following plan:</p>
<h3>Construction Sections</h3>
<p>The upstream section, from Guajingkou to Jianghe Village, is about 18 li. The width of the river in this section is more than 40 meters, and there are no overly narrow areas. However, there are silted and shallow areas in the riverbed that should be dredged to make the riverbed at least 0.85 meters lower than the Wusong River's zero mark. The downstream section, from Xugonggangkou East to Fanwangdu, is about 59 li. This section is the shallowest and narrowest. Since the Republic era, there have been long-standing desires to dredge it, but it has not been implemented. This section cannot be effectively treated without major dredging and cannot be done in stages. For the section from Fanwangdu East to the Waibaidu Bridge, the Shanghai Port Authority's estimates will be used to address areas requiring treatment.</p>
<h3>Cutting Out Bends</h3>
<p>The Wusong River's upstream section has a wide river and deep channel, similar to a lake. Although there are some bends, the branch ports and small rivers in between connect up and down, allowing for drainage during high tides. Therefore, there is no need to invest heavily in cutting them out. Also, between 40 and 50 meters from the entrance of Guajing, the riverbed is elevated, even above the Wusong zero mark. However, the main current has already abandoned the bend and flows through Huaxiang Port, which is 150 meters wide, and the riverbed is 1.0 to 2.0 meters lower than the Wusong zero mark. Therefore, the original river can also be left as it is. However, the Yejidun section downstream has the most bends and is the most prone to siltation. All proposed dredging plans to reroute it have been stopped due to the difficulty and expense of the project. Now, it is proposed to cut out the section from Anlangdu to Zhangjiadu at Yejidun and open a new river channel, which will be more than 2,900 meters long (refer to the opinion of the former Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau), 46 meters wide, an average of 5.396 feet deep, and 17.2 meters wide at the bottom, for a total of</p>
<p>174,000 cubic yards of compacted soil (provisionally estimated at 170,000).</p>
<h3>Volume of Earthwork</h3>
<p>The volume of earthwork for each section is based on cubic yards of compacted soil. The list is as follows: Guajingkou to Jianghe Village: 12,913.0 cubic yards; Xugonggang to Anlangdu: 391,494.0 cubic yards (excluding the Anlangdu to Zhangjiadu section); Zhangjiadu to Fanwangdu: 120,404.0 cubic yards; Fanwangdu to Xinzha Bridge: 122,500.0 cubic yards; Xinzha Bridge to Waibaidu Bridge: 56,220.0 cubic yards (The Shanghai Dredging Bureau has completed a portion of the project in the section from Fanwangdu to Waibaidu Bridge. This amount of earthwork should be deducted during future construction.) The total is 703,530.0 cubic yards. The earthwork for the new river channel is estimated to be 170,000 cubic yards. It is estimated that the earthwork above the water level accounts for about 54% of the total, while the earthwork below the water level accounts for about 46% of the total.</p>
<h3>Dredging Method</h3>
<p>The dredging project consists of two methods: manual excavation and mechanical ship excavation. However, the use of manual labor in previous projects took several months, causing transportation disruptions and harming agriculture and commerce. Furthermore, the river has a dense network of tributaries, and it is estimated that there are more than one hundred dams. Constructing dams and isolating water requires significant labor and expense. With the exception of manual excavation for the section cutting the bend at Anpai Ferry, it is appropriate to use mechanical ship excavation across the board. It can also be carried out over several years, and funding can be arranged in a relaxed manner, which is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The total earthwork, excluding the project to cut the bend and straighten the river, is about 700,000 cubic yards of compacted soil, which is 1,050,000 cubic yards of wet soil. It is planned to be carried out over six years, with 170,000 cubic yards of earthwork excavated each year. Excluding repairs and other reasons for suspending work, the working time is estimated at 250 days per year, requiring 700 cubic yards of earthwork to be excavated each day. It is now planned to purchase one large dredger and two small dredgers so that the total amount of earthwork can be completed within six years. The complete budget for the dredging project after the dredging is completed and the annual budget are listed below. (1) Total cost of earthwork: 1,515,460 yuan; first year's expenses: 215,460 yuan; expenses for the second to sixth years: 260,000 yuan per year. (2) Total cost of land acquisition: 66,750 yuan; expenses for the first year: 66,750 yuan (the above amount is for the acquisition of private land for cutting the bend and widening the river). (3) Total cost of three dredgers, large and small: 310,000 yuan. (4) Total cost of two tugboats: 50,000 yuan. (5) Total cost of machine factory and equipment: 10,000 yuan. (6) Total administrative expenses for six years: 120,000 yuan. (7) Total reserve expenses: 67,790 yuan. The total is 2,140,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard Barge Workers on Strike</h3>
<p>Clash Results in Multiple Injuries</p>
<p>After a strike at the Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard Towboat Company last year, another incident occurred when the company dismissed a worker, triggering a strike by all workers. Furthermore, the company sent replacement workers to work, further escalating the conflict and resulting in multiple injuries. It is unknown whether this will be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Worker Dismissal</h3>
<p>Since partnering with Moutai, Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard has many barges and employs many workers. Management is usually very strict. The day before yesterday at around 5:00 PM, a stoker on a small steamboat, named Yin Shenggeng, had a conflict with a colleague and ended up fighting. Afterwards, the Western manager, Vigro, learned about this and dismissed Yin and replaced him with Chen Are, who went to take over. Yin Shenggeng reported this to the Barge Workers' Union.</p>
<h3>Strike Erupts</h3>
<p>Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard has a total of 102 towboats and small steamboats, employing over 500 workers. They have organized a barge transport union, and all workers must join the union. When Yin Shenggeng was dismissed and the new worker, Chen Are, went to replace him, the workers believed that the company had dismissed the worker without notifying the union, and Chen Are was not a member of the union. Even if new workers were to be hired, union members should be given priority. The workers absolutely refused to accept Chen Are and demanded that the company rescind the decision to replace Yin Shenggeng. The company refused, so all the workers went on strike yesterday, and the strike has expanded.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The workers have already made demands and negotiated with Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard General Manager Vigro. The company authorities must earnestly fulfill the living conditions to protect workers, and any new workers hired by the company should be approved by the union and union members should be given priority. General Manager Vigro rejected the workers' demands, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Party Headquarters, etc., sent representatives Shen Fu (General Labor Union) and Huang Tiren (Municipal Party Headquarters) to the Barge Transport Union and the Hong Kong &amp; Whampoa Dockyard Company to mediate.</p>
<p>Vigro's attitude was resolute, and there were no results.</p>
<h3>Clash Erupts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all barge workers went on strike and were unable to work. The company then sent out more than ten reserve workers from General Manager Vigro to work on the barges. Vigro also told the workers that if they did not return to work by yesterday afternoon, the company would hire new workers. All the workers were united on this matter and refused to let the new workers board the barges. Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, more than ten new workers were sent to work on the barges and were beaten up by all the workers. One of the new workers, Jin Heshang, was seriously injured in the foot and managed to escape and seek treatment at the Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Many others were unable to escape and were beaten and injured. The situation is now deteriorating, and the company is unwilling to back down and has reported the incident to the police, who transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. As a result, goods being transferred between the company's ships have been blocked by the strike, causing enormous losses to the merchants.</p>
<h3>List of Injured</h3>
<p>The new workers who were beaten and injured include Chen Fugui, 37 years old, from Ningbo, whose legs were injured by iron bars; Wu Zongzhai, 35 years old, who injured his left leg; Zhou Xiaochun, 50 years old, who injured his head</p>
<p>and broke a rib; Hu Genfang, 30 years old, who injured his head. The above four were transported to Renji Hospital by Agent No. 8 from the Shuyao Police Station.</p>

<h3>Sino-German Negotiations on State-Owned Steel Plant Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industries to Send More Personnel to Investigate Coal and Iron Nationwide</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Industries' plan to establish a state-owned steel plant, Minister Chen Gongbo and representatives of the German Xiwang Third Company have negotiated several times in Nanjing and have reached an agreement. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Plant Location Decided</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industries considers iron and coal to be the main conditions for establishing a steel plant and vital to the plant's future success. Therefore, before planning the establishment of the steel plant, experts were assigned to investigate the iron ore and coal production in various regions. After two years of research, it was determined that the Yangtze River Basin has rich iron and coal reserves and convenient transportation. Therefore, after negotiating with representatives of the German Xiwang Third Company in Nanjing, it was decided to locate the plant at Ma'anshan, near Dangtu. The coal will be sourced from the Gaokeng Coal Mine in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, for initial exploitation and use.</p>
<h3>Iron and Coal Survey</h3>
<p>After deciding on the location of the state-owned steel plant, the Ministry of Industries has begun preparations for various tasks. It is expected that some of the plant's work can begin in May or June. The Ministry recently, in order to clarify the amount of iron and coal reserves nationwide, will send more personnel to various provinces to conduct on-site surveys. According to previous surveys by foreigners, China's iron reserves total 766,899,000 tons (of which Liaoning accounts for 307,580,000 tons), and coal reserves total 997,604,000,000 tons. However, it is believed that the actual reserves nationwide must be twice this amount, because the previous surveys by foreigners only covered North China and the Northwest, while the Southwest provinces were not included.</p>
<h3>Twenty-First Fiscal Year Postal Savings Bureau Business Report</h3>

<p>Remittance Business: (A) Domestic Remittances: (1) Money Orders: The total amount issued throughout the year was 164,849,000 yuan, a decrease of approximately 10% compared to the previous year's 183,716,100 yuan.

The total amount paid out was 794.47 yuan, a decrease of approximately 73% compared to the previous year's 2,893.82 yuan.</p>
<p>Business Overview: The total amount of domestic remittances for the twenty-first fiscal year decreased by approximately 10% compared to the previous year, and remittance income decreased by approximately 17%. The total amount of savings deposits also decreased by 6%. This is because after the fall of four provinces, the Ministry of Communications issued a clear order to blockade postal areas, resulting in significant losses for postal remittances. Furthermore, the unrest in Sichuan and Shandong provinces, the communist disaster in Jiangxi, the drought in Shanxi, and the war in northern Hebei all had a significant impact. However, the Bureau continued to work hard to develop postal remittance services. For example, the telegraphic transfer service, which began in February of last year, had a substantial amount of 44,000 yuan in just five months. This result is quite remarkable. Therefore, looking at the results of the above-mentioned remittance services, except for domestic remittances, the rest have shown significant progress. The decline in the total amount of domestic remittances is due to the decrease in the issuance of money orders. The small amount money order business is still showing satisfactory results, with an increase of approximately 82% compared to the previous year. This business is now expanding to various postal agencies, which is quite beneficial to the development of commerce in the interior. As for the decline in savings deposits, most of it is due to the decrease in checking account savings in the Shanghai and Nanjing areas, while passbook savings accounts and fixed deposit savings accounts have decreased less. Due to the impact of the war in the Beiping and Hebei areas, passbook savings deposits decreased by as much as 2 million yuan, but there is still a trend of increase in other areas. Furthermore, although the assets of the post office in the four northeastern provinces that were occupied are ten times greater than the savings deposits, the post office still recognizes the claims of all depositors and allows them to be cashed out. Before the end of that fiscal year, depositors had already received 50% of the total amount.</p>
<h3>Financial Circles Plan to Establish Ammonium Sulfate Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>Resisting Japanese Monopoly of the Market</p>
<p>Based on Yongli Company</p>
<p>Ammonium sulfate is a major modern chemical industrial product. In peacetime, it is used as fertilizer for farmland, and in wartime, it can be used to manufacture military supplies. According to reliable surveys, the annual consumption of ammonium sulfate in Japanese farmland reaches more than 620,000 tons. The use of artificial fertilizers by farmers in our country is not yet developed. Although our farmland area is ten times that of Japan, the annual consumption is only more than 150,000 tons. It is expected that after the improvement of agriculture in the future, the demand for ammonium sulfate will be unlimited. Examining various countries, all are striving for self-sufficiency in this item. In recent years, the number of ammonium sulfate manufacturing plants in Japan has increased to eleven, with an investment of 600 million yen, which seems to have reached a level sufficient for self-sufficiency. Recently, in our country's lost territory, the Manchurian Chemical Industry Company was established, with a capital of 25 million yen, half of which was received first. In April of last year, construction began in Dalian to build an ammonium sulfate plant, which is scheduled to be completed in November of this year. Recently, it has been heard that the work is being accelerated, and it may be completed within October. The plant is expected to produce approximately 180,000 tons annually. In the future, it will not only be self-sufficient, but will also dump its products in our country, monopolizing the East Asian market. It is heard that Chinese chemical industrialist Fan Xudong, and members of the financial community in this city Zhang Gongquan, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Guangfu, Xu Xinliu, and others, in view of the urgency of establishing a plant to produce artificial fertilizer themselves, and seeing the success of the Yongli Company's alkali production business, decided to establish an ammonium sulfate manufacturing plant based on that company. It is heard that the plan has been finalized. Chinese people, seeing the rapid progress of the Japanese in building industries in our lost territory, should know that we are lagging behind and must catch up quickly.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sends Personnel to Take Over Fuzhou and Xiamen Branches</h3>
<p>After the Fujian Incident occurred, all central government agencies directly under the jurisdiction were seized, and the Central Bank's branches in Fujian were also forcibly occupied at the same time. Now that the central government forces have successively recovered the important cities, in order to regulate the finances of these places, the President of the Central Bank, Kong Xiangxi, has specially sent Chen Zhongjiu to take over the Xiamen branch and resume operations as soon as possible. It is understood that Mr. Chen took a steamer from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to rush to Xiamen to take over. According to reporters, Wu Rijing, the director of the Fuzhou branch of the Central Bank, came to Shanghai to report everything to President Kong after being forced to take over the bank's operations by the Fujian side. Now that Fuzhou and other places have been recovered, and all bank operations urgently need to be reorganized and restored to normal, he also took a steamer yesterday afternoon with Chen Zhongjiu, the director of the Xiamen branch, to go to Fuzhou to take over.</p>
<h3>Director of the Telephone Bureau Xu Xueyu Resigns, Ministry Orders Retention</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu still goes to the bureau to work every day.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Xu Xueyu, director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, a member of the procurement committee, and concurrently acting chief technician, recently expressed his negativity because his proposals could not be fully implemented, and asked the ministry to resign from all his concurrent positions. The ministry has repeatedly issued orders to retain him, but Mr. Xu still finds it difficult to dismiss his intention to resign. It is now understood that the ministry believes that Mr. Xu has strived to develop the business since taking office, so it has re-issued an order to earnestly retain him. However, although Mr. Xu has submitted his resignation, he still goes to the bureau to work every day and has stated that he will work as long as he is in office.</p>
<h3>Telephone Line to be Added Between Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission believes that the Nanjing-Shanghai Highway is of great importance to transportation between Nanjing and Shanghai, so it has specially sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Directorate General of Telecommunications to plan to install a long-distance telephone line along the road, which will begin construction soon. This long-distance telephone line will start from Nanjing, pass through Jurong, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading, and reach Shanghai. The entire line is 232 miles long and will be installed with four pairs of number 10 steel wires. In addition to ordinary cross-connection, a carrier system will be added so that six telephone lines can be obtained on four wires. Materials are currently being prepared, and installation will begin in Nanjing within the next few days. It is expected to be completed and operational by early April. The total cost of the line is approximately 500,000 yuan. From then on, transportation between Nanjing and Shanghai will become more convenient.</p>
<h3>Director of the Telegraph Bureau Wu Baofeng Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rong Baoyi, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, has now been promoted to Director of the Fujian Directorate General of Telecommunications. Wu Baofeng has been appointed to fill the vacancy. Mr. Wu took a car to the bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to take over. The former Director Rong first led him into the director's office, rested for a while, and exchanged pleasantries. Then he began to take over the various departments, which was not completed until 4:00 p.m. All the original staff members have not been changed and continue to serve as usual. When the handover took place, the Ministry of Communications specially sent Xu Tonglai, Chief Accountant of the International Telecommunications Bureau, to supervise the inventory.</p>
<h3>Damaged Heavenly Kitchen Airplane Still Being Replaced</h3>
<p>Compensatory Trainer Plane Already Delivered</p>
<p>The all-metal fighter plane donated to the government by the Heavenly Kitchen Umami Monosodium Glutamate Factory of this city was damaged in the nose and wings when it landed during its first test flight at Hongqiao after assembly. After negotiations between the factory and the Zenshin Foreign Company, which sold the plane, it was agreed that in addition to replacing all the damaged parts, the foreign company would also provide a trainer plane, which was being offered for sale in Beiping, at no cost to compensate for the delay in delivery. It is now understood that the plane in Beiping had already been assembled, so the factory sent a letter to the government requesting the issuance of a passport, which was delivered by the Shanghai-Beiping train and arrived at the Hongqiao Airport the day before yesterday afternoon. Engineer Belle of the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs, who had previously come to Shanghai at the request of the Heavenly Kitchen Factory to inspect the damaged fighter plane and assist in the repair, will still inspect the trainer plane that has now been delivered and then schedule a test flight. The plane is a Junkers ASO type, made entirely of metal, and is slightly smaller than the fighter plane. As for the repair and replacement of the damaged plane, it was previously discovered that a small part also needed to be replaced. A casting was ordered from Germany, which will also be delivered within this month. Therefore, although there was a proposal to hold the naming ceremony on January 28, it will now be postponed again due to the further delay.</p>
<h3>Fan Shaozeng's Troops Report on Recent Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, received a telegram from Sichuan Commander Fan Shaozeng on the 23rd, reporting on the recent bandit suppression by his troops as follows: (1) Meng's brigade of Zeng's troops occupied the Shiyanmen position before dawn, and Liao's brigade occupied the Longtanhe area. The bandits were unable to resist, suffered heavy casualties, and retreated to the Longchang and Shiguanyin areas, where they stubbornly resisted in dangerous terrain. Later, due to the cold weather and snow, it was difficult for our troops to advance and attack. They are currently in a stalemate. (2) The troops of the Pseudo Eighty-eighth Division and the Pseudo Ninth Army were based in the areas of Guangmingzhai, Quanluoling, Longtoushan, Leigupo, and Luodingzhai. At dawn, our troops launched a general attack. After seven hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to resist and moved to the left and right. Taking advantage of the situation, they pursued the Zeng and Ye regiments and occupied Daluoling and Leigupo in the afternoon. The Meng and Liao brigades occupied Luodingzhai, Longtoushan, and Guangmingzhai. The bandits fled to the Longtanhe and Shiguanyin areas. They are currently being pursued. It is estimated that several hundred guns were captured in this battle, and several hundred bandits were killed. Due to the high mountains and dangerous terrain, our troops also suffered some casualties.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yao Zirang's Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand People Held the Funeral Ropes</p>
<p>Burial Must Be Done Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Zirang's funeral was held yesterday. At 10:00 a.m., the procession departed from the Yao residence on Caojia Street in the West Gate. Due to roadside sacrifices by various groups along the way, it did not reach the cemetery until 2:00 p.m. The funeral procession was very simple, with only items such as the memorial banner pavilion, tombstone pavilion, respectful pavilion, portrait pavilion, and coffin carriage. More than a thousand people from all walks of life held the funeral ropes. Mr. Yao's coffin was escorted along the way by the security corps, and music was played by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the security corps, the orphanage, the vocational training center, and other bands to express their grief, which was very solemn and respectful. It is heard that Mr. Yao's coffin is temporarily placed in the cemetery and must be buried tomorrow afternoon (the 25th). Those who plan to go to the cemetery for the funeral must gather at the Yao residence before 11:00 a.m. tomorrow to depart.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Completes Pudong Water Plant Project</h3>
<p>Plant Site and Water Source Surveyed and Determined at Youlong Pier in Yangjing District</p>
<p>Total Cost of 300,000 Yuan, Cooperation Between Government and Business Investment</p>
<p>Construction Can Begin Within This Year, Water Supply Expected in About One Year</p>
<p>The establishment of a water plant in Pudong was planned and designed by the municipal authorities beginning in the 18th year of the Republic. The entire plan has been completed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. More than 100 mu of land near the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong has been purchased, and the Pudong Youlong Pier has been surveyed and determined as the water source for the water plant. The total cost is 300,000 yuan, and a meeting will be held to decide the details in the next few days. Once the date of construction is determined, it is expected that water can be supplied in about one year. The Shin Shi News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Chen, the Section Chief of the Second Division of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the planning process and the current status. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>According to the municipal authorities' plan to build a water plant in Pudong, the project began in the 18th year of the Republic. At that time, the Pudong market was gradually becoming prosperous, and the number of residents was increasing daily. Most of the rivers were silted up, and the residents' drinking water was very unclean. This was not only harmful to the health of the people, but also in the event of a fire, there was no water supply for fire fighting, which could easily lead to conflagration. Local residents and health authorities felt that it was necessary to establish a water plant immediately. They jointly suggested this to the municipal government, and the then Mayor Zhang Yuejun also believed that the establishment of a water plant in Pudong was indeed urgent. He immediately ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate 80,000 yuan to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to actively prepare.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Plant Site</h3>
<p>After receiving the order, the Municipal Public Works Bureau immediately began to handle the matter separately. However, the search for a plant site was quite difficult because the site had to take into account the environment and also have a better water source. The water sources on the banks of the Pudong Yangjing District were mostly turbid and unsuitable for use. Recently, a site near the Youlong Pier, diagonally opposite the Tongren Pier in Puxi, has been found to be relatively suitable. At the same time, in between the Taikoo Wharf and the EWO Wharf nearby, there is a vacant land of more than 100 mu, which is sufficient for use. If necessary, the nearby area can be expanded to build water towers and other buildings. It was purchased for a price of more than 10,000 yuan. At the same time, an agreement was reached with the Municipal Ferry Management Office to cede the Youlong Pier for dredging and use as a water source.</p>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p>The first phase of the water plant project requires 300,000 yuan. In addition to the 80,000 yuan previously allocated during Mayor Zhang's tenure, the remaining 200,000 yuan is still needed to carry out the construction. The 80,000 yuan that had been allocated, except for about 20,000 yuan spent on land purchase and design, was taken back by the Municipal Finance Bureau and used for other purposes during the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident because the municipal treasury was in financial difficulty. As a result, the water plant, which was about to begin construction, had to be suspended temporarily. Now, the municipal authorities, in response to the needs of the facts and the requests of the gentry and directors of Pudong, have decided to implement the project in the shortest possible time. Moreover, the current total donations of foreign merchants' warehouses, factories, etc. in Pudong are often withheld or not paid on the pretext of inadequate municipal public facilities. If the water plant is established, the amount of taxes that can be recovered is no less than tens of thousands of yuan. The Pudong market can also become more prosperous as a result, and the increase in land value tax, calculated on the basis of 4,000 mu in the Yangjing District, is also considerable. The municipal authorities will also indirectly benefit from this. However, recently, the municipal government still does not have such a large amount of money available for the time being. In order to allocate funds for construction as soon as possible, Mayor Wu recently convened a meeting of Pudong gentry and the banking community in this city to discuss loan methods. Yao Mulian, Kui Yanfang, Lin Kanghou, Pan Zhifang, Cai Zengji, Xu Peihuang, and others have been appointed as members of the committee, and a meeting will be convened in the next few days to decide on the method. It is heard that a satisfactory solution is expected to be reached in the short term and construction will begin.</p>
<h3>Date of Water Supply</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Chen, who is in charge of the preparation of the plant, everything related to the internal construction and equipment of the plant has been designed and drawn. Procedures such as bidding for construction have also been prepared. The selection of machinery, the route of the water pipes, and the procedures for ordering and contracting have all been drafted. Now, only the funding needs to be resolved. As soon as the funding is resolved, we can start dredging the water source and building the plant, and order machinery from abroad. The entire project can be completed in at most one year.</p>
<h3>Prominent Dye Merchant Fan Aisheng Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Shantou Road Pre-Parked Ice 539 Car</p>
<p>Kidnappers Snatched Fan into the Car and Speeded Away</p>
<p>｜｜ Chauffeur Franticly Went Home to Report｜｜</p>
<p>Fan Aisheng, 47 years old, from Jiangyin, resides at No. 31 Songshan Road. He made his fortune in the dye business and has accumulated a huge fortune. He occupies a prominent position among dye merchants. However, Fan is frugal by nature, so he lives very simply. Even when he goes out every day, he only hires a chartered car. At 7:45 p.m. yesterday, Fan had a social engagement, so he took his chartered car to Shantou Road. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Shantou Road and Guangxi Road, four bandits suddenly jumped out of the roadside. Two bandits were empty-handed, and two bandits were armed with guns. They blocked Fan's car and threatened the driver to stop. The driver had no choice but to stop the car. The four bandits then went forward together, grabbed Fan, and prohibited him from making any noise. They dragged him into a public concession registration No. 6539 black plate car that was parked on the roadside, and sped away. At that time, Fan's driver, seeing his master being kidnapped, was frantic and dared not make any noise, fearing that his master's life would be endangered. After the bandits' car drove far away, he rushed home to report and reported to the Old Gate Police Station, requesting assistance. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate. They searched in all directions, but there were no clues as of midnight. At the same time, the bandits' car was not found. Therefore, the police station notified all municipal police agencies, requesting their assistance.</p>
<h3>Murderous Plot Against Elementary School Student Wang Deyu Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Ayuan Acquitted</p>
<p>Ding Yin, a 49-year-old woman from Wuxi, the owner of Ding Juxing Iron Shop at No. 658 Xiaoshadu Road, Shanghai West, is a widow and has a 13-year-old only son, Ding Fugeng, who studies at the Ba Xianqiao Sino-French School in the French Concession. Because the school is far away and inconvenient to travel back and forth every day, he boards at his aunt's house at No. 123 Laohe Road. Wang Deyu, 26 years old, is the son of the deceased husband's brother who married into the family. He also worked in the iron shop business. Because of his bad behavior, he lost his job and was unemployed. He often asked Ms. Yin for loans, but Ms. Yin refused to associate with him because she could not bear the trouble. Unexpectedly, Deyu held a grudge from then on. Seeing that Ms. Yin had dozens of acres of good farmland, houses, and shops in her hometown, he wanted to seize this property. Because Ms. Yin had a biological son, Fugeng, it was difficult to achieve his goal, so he had the idea of murdering Fugeng. In October of last year, while Ms. Yin was back in her hometown, on the 25th of the same month, Deyu waited in front of the Sino-French School at noon. When he saw Fugeng leaving school, he stepped forward and falsely claimed to Fugeng, "Your mother is in the countryside and sent me to call you back to the countryside." Fugeng was young and ignorant and fell for his trick. He was lured to the cotton fields next to the Xuan family's residence in Longhua Airport and killed by Zhou Ayuan (the same age as Deyu), a Jiangyin native who lived at No. 1 Zhangjiabang Road, Jumen Road, Shanghai South, and worked in the same industry. The body was abandoned in the wilderness and the perpetrators fled. After the incident, the body was identified by the land protector and the Shanghai District Court. Later, the body was claimed by the mother, and detectives from the Public Security Bureau first arrested the accomplice Zhou Ayuan. According to Zhou's confession, they went to Nanxiang and arrested the principal offender Wang Deyu and brought him back to Shanghai. The French police believed that the location where the deceased was lured was within the French Concession, so they immediately transferred the two criminals, Wang and Zhou, to the case and sent them to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in previous reports. It is now understood that this case was originally presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. Later, because Mr. Zhang was transferred to the Third Branch of the High Court, it was taken over by Judge Wu Fanglian. Later, Mr. Wu, out of caution, repeatedly reopened the debate and conducted a thorough investigation in order to avoid injustice. This case has been tried and concluded, and yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 10:00 a.m., Judge Wu appeared in court and ordered the two criminals to be brought to the court. The main text of the judgment stated: Wang Deyu, for premeditated murder, is sentenced to death and deprived of public rights indefinitely. Zhou Ayuan is acquitted. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen requested that Zhou Ayuan be temporarily detained during the appeal period. The court approved the request and ordered the two defendants to be transferred to the detention center to await further instructions during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau Discovers Embezzlement Case Involving Over 80,000</h3>
<p>Forging Director's Signature and Illegally Engraving Director's Seal</p>
<p>Clerk Deng Darong Has Been Detained and Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau of this city, during the year-end tax settlement for the 22nd year of the Republic, suddenly discovered a major case involving Deng Darong, a second-class clerk of the bureau, who forged the director's seal to fraudulently obtain a large sum of tax money from the Central Bank. Deng has now been detained and sent to court to await legal sanctions. The Da Gong She reporter received the news and went to the Unified Tax Bureau on Chengdu Road to interview Chen Yan'yin, the head of the First Section, and learned the details of the case as follows:</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Discovered During Year-End Reconciliation</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau has management offices and inspection offices. Taxes collected by the management offices are directly submitted to the Tax Affairs Department, and the amount submitted is reported to the bureau. Taxes collected by the inspection offices are directly submitted by manufacturers in various locations to the Central Bank or its branches, with bank receipts submitted to the offices, which then report to the bureau. At the end of last year, the bureau reconciled accounts with the Central Bank. Due to the bank's busy year-end settlement, there was no time for detailed verification. It was not until January 4th of this year that both parties reconciled clearly. Although the amount collected and submitted on the books was accurate, the tax certificates issued by the bureau were short by 84,321.21 yuan. Therefore, it was discovered that there must be fraud involved. The bureau quietly investigated and found that Deng Darong, a second-class clerk, had privately engraved a seal, forged checks, and fraudulently obtained tax money.</p>
<h3>Extravagant Behavior Arouses Suspicion</h3>
<p>Deng Darong is from Jiangxi and has been a second-class clerk in the bureau for about two years, handling tax remittance documents in the cashier's section. He usually behaves extravagantly and spends lavishly. Even the secretary and section chief of the bureau, who earns more than Deng, does not have Deng's air. The director of the bureau, Wang Zongmo, had already become suspicious. In mid-December of last year, he transferred Chen Yan'yin, the secretary, to be the head of the First Section, instructing him to investigate the accounts and pay attention to any irregularities. This was because of the year-end reconciliation with the Central Bank. Otherwise, the bureau's dealings with the Central Bank only require monthly reconciliations, and there would be no detailed reconciliation. Furthermore, Deng's leave of absence to Guangdong at the end of the year further aroused suspicion among the bureau's staff.</p>
<h3>Returns from Leave and is Detained and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Although Deng Darong is from Jiangxi, his family is in Guangdong. At the end of last year, Deng suddenly took sick leave to return to Guangdong, initially planning to return to Shanghai on the 4th of this year, but later informed that he would return on the 6th. At this time, the bureau had already discovered Deng's embezzlement, so when Deng arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong on the 6th, senior officials of the bureau went to the dock to meet him. As soon as Deng landed, he was invited to meet the director at the Tax Affairs Department on the Bund (because Director Wang also served as the director of the Tax Affairs Department). He was severely questioned about everything. Deng initially denied it, but when he was shown the forged checks from the Central Bank, he bowed his head and had nothing to say. Deng was immediately sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention, and the bureau transferred him to the court for interrogation. The prosecutor has already opened an investigative court once.</p>
<h3>Mysterious and Clever Method of Fraud</h3>
<p>The cashier's section of the bureau has always withdrawn money by having the head of the cashier's section write the amount to be withdrawn on the check and submit it to Director Wang for his personal signature and seal before it can be withdrawn from the Central Bank. Deng was responsible for handling tax remittance documents in the cashier's section, so he sometimes wrote the checks on behalf of the section chief. Deng secretly paid attention to the director's seal and signature style for fraudulent use. His method of embezzlement was to retain tax money for his own use. "For example, this month, Hangzhou remitted 10,000 yuan in cotton tax, 10,000 yuan in cement tax, and 10,000 yuan in match tax to the bureau, totaling 30,000 yuan. Deng used a forged check to withdraw this amount from the Central Bank, and the remittance documents were temporarily set aside. When other provinces remitted tax money in the following month, the previous tax money would be replenished, and then the remittance documents would be made and reported." However, the amount remitted by various provinces sometimes had odd fractions of a few jiao and fen, so Deng sometimes had to deposit cash into the bank to match the amounts between the Unified Tax Bureau and the Central Bank. Therefore, during the monthly reconciliation, the amounts reconciled by both parties were accurate, and the embezzlement was not discovered for a year. This was due to such sleight of hand. As for the source of Deng's blank checks, he obtained them by fraud in the check request form in the checkbook and fraudulently obtained them from the bank.</p>
<h3>Search of Deng's Residence Reveals Some Remaining Funds</h3>
<p>Deng Darong's residence in Shanghai is at 19 Kangle Village, Fuxu Road. The court has sent judicial police to search the residence and found 11,000 yuan in cash in the Kenyee Bank, as well as several thousand yuan in other property. The rest of the fraudulently obtained money has been squandered by Deng. As for whether there is any other property in Guangdong, it is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Director of Unified Tax Bureau Voluntarily Requests Punishment</h3>
<p>Finally, according to Chen Yan'yin, the head of the First Section of the bureau, told the Da Gong She reporter that at the beginning of the incident, it was mostly suspected that many people were involved. It was not until Deng Darong confessed that it was Deng alone who embezzled, and no one else was involved. As for the Central Bank's oversight, because it and the Tax Bureau are both agencies of the Ministry of Finance, this loss can be considered common. However, Director Wang has voluntarily requested punishment for negligence due to his official duties.</p>
<h3>Seven Maids Poisoned by Coal Gas</h3>
<p>Six Rescued, One Dies</p>
<p>In the residence of Wang E'zeng, a secretary of the Naval Survey Bureau from Fuzhou, located at 72 Mingde Lane, Dingxu Road, French Concession, seven maids were employed: Da Wu, Xiao Wu, Ling Ma, Chen Ma, Zhou Ma, Wang Ma, and Liu Ma. There were also several male servants, all from Anhui. At night, the seven maids slept in the attic. The night before last (22nd), because the weather was cold, each maid used a tin garbage can to ignite coal briquettes and place them in the room for heating. After everyone fell asleep, they were all suffocated by coal gas. At 8:30 yesterday morning, the owner saw that the maids had not gotten up and knocked on the door for a long time. There was no response from the room, arousing suspicion. The male servant Liu Fubao pried open the door and entered, filled with coal gas. The maids were all unconscious, breathing weakly, and on the verge of death. The employer immediately ordered an urgent report to the police, and they were taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Among the seven maids, Zhou Ma (around 30 years old) died due to severe poisoning at around 10 o'clock. The rest were rescued and survived. The hospital notified the police, and Detective Zhang Chunsheng was sent to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy center. It was found that the deceased had no family members in Shanghai, and a report will be made to the Second Special District Court today to send personnel for inspection.</p>
<h3>Guangfu Xing Game Shop Carelessness Investigated as Arson, Seeking Compensation</h3>
<p>Jin Yongchang Confesses Conspiracy Details</p>
<p>Shop Owner and Other Related Parties Arrested</p>
<p>Guangfu Xing Game Shop at 163 Yunnan Road suddenly caught fire at 4:35 AM the day before yesterday. Dense smoke filled the air, and the fire was extremely fierce. Soon, it broke through the roof. After the fire brigades from various sections tried their best to extinguish the fire, 163 was completely burned down, and the adjacent 161 and 165 were also severely damaged. Afterwards, the Laozha Police Station ordered Chinese Detectives Yang Dechun and He Chengrui to investigate the source of the fire. A man named Jin Yongchang from this region came forward and confessed. When the detectives asked how the fire started, Jin said, "I live in the attic of the house. Before the fire, I got up to urinate and accidentally knocked over the kerosene stove. The kerosene flowed from the floor into the coal briquette basin downstairs, causing the fire." The detectives found many loopholes in Jin's confession and took him to the police station for strict interrogation. Jin finally revealed the truth, saying that the owners of Guangfu Xing, Fan Guanglai and Fan Zhongyan from Chongming, had taken out fire insurance with the Shanghai Reiss &amp; Co. Insurance Department of the German merchant in November last year, totaling 8,600 yuan. At that time, Guo Xichou said that if there was a fire, he would be able to find a way to obtain compensation, but Guo would deduct 40%. Two weeks ago, Fan invited me to discuss the plan to commit arson. He instructed me to start the fire upstairs first, and they would light nine small baskets filled with waste paper and soaked in gasoline downstairs, one by one. After it was done, they promised to reward me with 50 yuan. Yesterday, I carried out this plan." The detectives then separately arrested the two Fans and Guo, as well as the shop assistants Chen Yuanlang and the apprentice Yao Chuanlang, and detained them. Last night, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The police station's lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, prosecuting them for the crime of public endangerment under Article 187 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the case still needs to be investigated and requested a postponement of the trial. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Division, verified the report, briefly questioned each defendant, and ordered a change of date for further verification.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Drops Sharply, Navigational Routes Above and Below Stream Are Severed into Four Sections</h3>
<p>Yangtze River Line Requires Transshipment at Wuhu</p>
<p>Hunan Line Requires Transshipment at Xindi</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level this year is shallow and dropping rapidly. Initially, it dropped four or five feet, then suddenly dropped more than ten feet. Yesterday, the downstream water level further decreased by more than one foot, while the upstream water level sharply dropped to five feet. Shanghai-bound river steamers to Hankou, larger vessels, can only load one-quarter of their capacity, and navigation above and below stream is extremely difficult. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Water Level Drops Again Yesterday, the various shipping companies received a telegram from Hankou stating that on the 22nd, the downstream Yangtze River water level had sharply decreased by more than one foot. The current highest point has dropped from 11 feet 5 inches to 10 feet 4 inches. The Jianghan Customs notified all ships that the draft for upstream cargo should not exceed 10 feet, and the water level is continuing to decrease. The Taiziji and Xiaogushan areas downstream are even shallower, making it extremely difficult for river steamers to navigate.</p>
<p>Blocked into Two Sections The Yangtze River, from Shanghai to Hankou, is blocked at Wuhu. All river steamers with a draft of 11 feet cannot pass through the area. In the past few days, six or seven vessels have been stranded in Wuhu due to the shallow water. Yesterday, the Songpu of Sanbei was again unable to sail upstream due to the water level dropping to 10 feet 4 inches. It transshipped 2,700 pieces of cargo at Wuhu using barges and then managed to pass. Other shipping companies' river steamers also transship at Wuhu. Furthermore, yesterday the upstream water level to Changsha dropped to five feet. Ships going upstream from Hankou can only reach Chenglingji, then use small boats to tow barges to transfer cargo. Cargo going downstream from Changsha is also transshipped to ships at that location. The upstream and downstream routes have been divided into four sections for navigation.</p>
<p>Cargo Congestion The Yangtze River lines, whether upstream or downstream, except for shallow-water vessels, larger ships have followed the Jianghan Customs' notification since the 20th, reducing their loading capacity. River steamers over 3,000 tons can only load 25% to 30% of their cargo, resulting in a large accumulation of incoming goods in Hunan and Hankou. Many passengers plan to arrive in Shanghai within the next three weeks, so they are requesting various companies to add shallow-water vessels to increase cargo capacity. The China Merchants Bureau's Hankou branch has also requested the Shanghai Bureau to transfer two shallow-water sea vessels to Hankou to transport cargo, and has requested that the Kuaili be rerouted to Shanghai-Hankou to quickly carry passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>Surcharge Tomorrow The Yangtze River shallow-water surcharge, agreed upon by six companies, will be increased by 15% starting tomorrow, with a deadline of March 15th. The various shipping companies, due to the poor business conditions of the Yangtze River and the plummeting freight rates, have delayed the collection of the shallow-water surcharge compared to last year. However, it is heard that the companies will still collect the 15% shallow-water surcharge at 95% of the usual freight rate.</p>
<h3>City's New Ferry No. 5 to Start Sailing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chunjiang New Line to Launch Next Month</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai city ferry extended its route to Wusong last summer, it has greatly increased the convenience of travelers. Now, in order to meet the needs of the environment, in addition to the original three ferries, a new, spacious ferry has been added, which will join the route at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. The bureau also plans to open the Chunjiang Wharf route, which is currently being actively prepared and is scheduled to be officially completed on March 4th. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Seamless Transportation Facilitates Traffic</h3>
<p>The city ferry terminal, previously built by the bureau at the old site of the wharf on the Wusong Town Outer Ma Road, has been completed. The original three ferries are insufficient, so this spacious new No. 5 ferry has been added to increase the convenience of passengers and cargo. The stops are the same as before, departing from Shanghai and Wusong every hour on the hour. The ferry can carry 500-600 passengers and can also load cargo, with quite excellent facilities. It is heard that the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus company also plans to extend its Wusong to Baoshan and Wusong to Yanghang routes to the Wusong ferry terminal, so that it can connect with the ferry schedule.</p>
<h3>Chunjiang Route to Launch Next Month</h3>
<p>The Chunjiang Wharf, which the city ferry bureau previously planned to open, runs directly from the New Customs to the opposite bank of Pudong. Since the planning began, the overall arrangements have been completed. It is expected to start sailing around the 4th of next month, running every two or three minutes, in order to improve the traffic between the Bund of the Great World and the opposite bank, so as to avoid the inconvenience of detours.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Stamp Tax Bureau to Change the Stamp Duty Period for Account Books</h3>
<p>Because the Closing Period is in February</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, based on joint letters from various industry guilds, requested the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau to allow businesses to stamp their account books in February of each year to avoid misunderstandings. Yesterday, it specifically forwarded a letter stating, "We received letters from the Rice Industry, Native Cloth Industry, Pollen Industry, Lumber Industry, Tobacco and Alcohol Industry, Seafood Industry, Cosmetics Industry, Chinese and Foreign Sundries Industry, Silk Thread and Sock Dyeing Industry, Fresh Medicine Industry, Jewelry Industry, Tea and Ink Industry, Hat Shop Industry, Leather and Wool Hat Industry, Noodle Restaurant Industry, Medical Wine Shop Industry, Blacksmith Industry, Construction Factory Industry, Seafood Sundries Industry, Sugar and Longan Industry, Flour Mill Industry, Tobacco Leaf Industry, Cotton Shop Industry, Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Knitting Industry, Department Store Industry, and Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Associations stating that the account books used by businesses are stamped annually per volume in accordance with the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations promulgated by the National Government, but the business accounting year has long been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be closed at the end of January of the following year, so businesses must change to new books in February at the same time as stamping. This is a long-standing habit in the business community. If you want to replace the new book before the final account, it is difficult to implement, and it is an unexpected burden to restamp the book for one year, and there is no legal basis for it. Therefore, the date of affixing the new stamps for this year's book should be set to start from February 15th. If there are any unused books from last year, they should be affixed with one jiao stamp when used in February 15th of this year to comply with the regulations. We jointly request your association to review and quickly forward the letter to the Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau for approval and processing, and to inform the inspectors in each district to avoid misunderstandings, and hope to see a reply," etc. The commercial year-end closing is ordered to be the end of January of the following year, then changing to a new book or using an old book, and stamping it, is always in February of the Gregorian calendar. The request to affix the stamp starting from February 15th is to avoid misunderstandings during inspection. We hereby request your bureau to check and notify the inspectors to avoid misunderstandings, and hope to see a reply. This is to the utmost importance. This is addressed to the Jiangsu Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau.</p>

<h3>Trolleybus Floor Breaks, Injuring People; Taxpayers' Association Pays Attention to Aftermath</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department is Responsible for Supervising Public Utilities</p>
<p>Inquires About Measures and Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, regarding the recent trolleybus floor breaking and injuring passengers, specifically sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday inquiring about the measures taken in response to the incident. The original letter stated, "On the 20th of this month, it was reported that on the 19th, at 6:30 PM, on the 17th (mistakenly written as 14th) trolleybus, the floor of the third-class carriage suddenly fell, injuring three passengers. The tram company should bear full responsibility for the above facts. Your bureau is responsible for supervising public utilities and should also make corrections.

<h3>Seamen's Union Mediates Shanghai Lun's Work Stoppage; Work Resumes Immediately</h3>
<p>The Ship Sailed Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Four Measures Established</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lun, a ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company leased to the China Merchants Bureau, with a total of sixty-eight workers, had a work stoppage due to the company's unwarranted dismissal of workers. After the Seamen's Union mediated overnight, work was resumed late the night before. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overnight Mediation The workers in various departments of the ship had been opposing the company's deduction of wages and dismissal of all workers in the seamen's department. Repeated mediation by the union was ineffective. Therefore, at 3:30 PM the day before, all workers in various departments stopped working and declared a work stoppage. Persuasion by personnel from the Seamen's General Union and branch unions was ineffective. At 8:00 PM the night before, Ye Chuanfang, the company's manager, personally went to the union to negotiate. The union then summoned Wang Yongfa, the representative of the dismissed seamen, for mediation. Cheng Deyuan from the General Union and Si Shijian from the branch union attended until late at night, when a resolution was finally reached.</p>
<p>Four Measures The Seamen's Branch repeatedly persuaded both parties and decided on four measures: (1) One and a half months' salary will be paid to the former seamen Wang Yongfa, etc. All of Wang Yongfa's insurance policies will be cancelled. (2) The company will assist the Seamen's Union in persuading current seamen who have not joined the union to join. (3) In the future, the company should provide reasons and seek the union's consent one week before dismissing workers. (4) In the future, when there are vacancies on the company's ships, the union must recommend candidates for employment, but without signing a contract.</p>
<p>Work Resumes and Departs The sixty-eight workers in the firemen, sailors, stevedores, and hold departments of the ship were satisfied with the resolution. Representatives from the Seamen's Union and Seamen's Branch boarded the ship to urge them to resume work immediately. All the workers resumed work late at night, and the ship departed as usual yesterday morning, sailing to Qingdao. The work stoppage was resolved.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Prepares to Launch Special Express Steamer Between Beijing and Hankou</h3>
<p>To Launch After Kuaili Completes Its Assignment</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Plans Joint Steamer Transportation</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after Zhang Yanxiang, director of the Navigation Administration Office of the Hubei Provincial Construction Department, suggested launching a special express steamer between Beijing and Hankou, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau has been preparing, and the two Railway Administrations are preparing to handle joint transportation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>China Merchants Prepares</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, instructed He Molin, the chief of the business department, and Zhao Yuntai, the chief of the shipbuilding department, to formulate a plan for launching the special express steamer between Hankou and Nanjing, as well as the schedule and price list. He also designated the Emei river steamer to sail. However, the Emei ran aground in Fuzhou. After rescue efforts failed, it is still stranded on the reef, causing the plan to launch the special express steamer between Beijing and Hankou to be suspended. Now, the bureau plans to send the Kuaili river steamer, but the Kuaili is still on assignment, and there is no launch date for the time being.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Study</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations submitted Zhang Yanxiang's proposal for the express steamer to the traffic department for study of joint transportation measures. Now, Zheng Baozhao of the traffic department has formulated the measures: (1) Sign a contract with the steamer bureau (or company) to issue joint tickets between major stations on both railways, as well as Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou. (2) Contact the Pinghan Railway, Nanxun Railway, and Yuehan Railway's Hunan-Hubei section to discuss all joint transportation procedures. (3) Set the fare and pre-define all joint transportation prices. (4) Set the validity period for one-way and round-trip joint tickets. (5) Stipulate the free baggage weight and excess baggage charges. (6) Transportation procedures, such as if the express steamer stops at Xiaguan, passengers and their luggage from the Beijing Station of this railway to the steamer wharf must be transported by motor vehicle. This motor vehicle can be purchased by the railway, jointly operated by both parties, or contracted by the China Merchants Bureau. How the expenses will be distributed and whether this transportation fee should be added to the joint ticket must be negotiated. (7) Wharf facilities, such as if the express steamer docks at the Nanjing Jiangbian Station wharf of this railway, the above procedures can be waived, and passengers will find it more convenient. However, all facilities on the wharf must be fully arranged. (8) Contact the customs to discuss matters related to the inspection of luggage. (10) Publicize the implementation of this measure vigorously to attract customers.</p>
<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>According to the report from the traffic department of the two railways on the current status of joint transportation between Beijing and Hankou: (1) Joint transportation from Shanghai to Hankou has long been implemented. According to the current schedule, it takes a total of 61 hours and 25 minutes from Shanghai to Beijing, via Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, to Hankou. The joint transportation ticket price is 81.6 yuan for first class, 52.7 yuan for second class, and 26.35 yuan for third class (including the surcharge for the special express train and the ferry fee, but not including the sleeper fee for first and second class). (2) Two years before the founding of the Republic, the two railways signed a joint transportation contract with the China Merchants Bureau and Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, and Nisshin shipping companies. Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hankou or from Hankou to Shanghai who wish to take a passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai section can declare in advance and take the passenger train of this railway at the Shanghai and Beijing stations with the voucher issued by the bureaus and companies. After the joint transportation of each railway was implemented, domestic tour tickets were issued, traveling from Shanghai to Beijing, via the Tianjin-Pukou Line and the Beijing-Shenyang Line to Beijing, then from the Beijing-Hankou Line, from Beijing to Hankou, and taking a steamer from Hankou to Shanghai. (2) The Beijing-Wu highway is now under construction. The two railways have consulted with the Beijing-Wu Highway Long-Distance Bus Preparation Office of the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Anhui Beijing-Wu West Section Long-Distance Bus Company on joint transportation measures, and a contract will be signed soon.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Rui Steamer Safely Arrives at Laoyao Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Delayed Due to Anchoring in Fog</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Hai Rui steamer, which departed from Shanghai on the 17th of this month for the Laoyao Wharf in Haizhou to load cargo for the Longhai Railway intermodal transport, was scheduled to arrive at Laoyao on the 19th. However, as of the day before yesterday, it had still not arrived. As a result, Chen Yongjie, the director of the Haizhou branch, urgently telegraphed Shanghai to inquire. The Shanghai General Bureau's radio station immediately broadcasted a call to the Hai Rui. Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, the Haizhou branch received a telegram reporting that the Hai Rui had safely arrived at Laoyao at 11:00 AM yesterday. The reason for the delay was that the ship encountered fog on the sea near Laoyao, and the captain, in order to avoid danger, anchored and stopped midway.</p>
<h3>After Completing Sino-British Communication, It Is Decided to Continue Sino-Italian Communication</h3>
<p>International Telegraph Bureau Regularly Receives the Press</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Agency, since the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Telegraph Bureau began direct communication with various countries around the world, it has established direct communication with twelve countries, including the United States, Germany, France, and the Philippines. The recently established Sino-British direct communication has been tested for over twenty hours and is now smooth and unimpeded. It is expected that 24-hour communication can be achieved within days. The bureau now intends to proceed with communication between China and Italy after the Sino-British communication is successful. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Regular Reception</h3>
<p>According to Wen Yuqing, the director of the bureau, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound Agency, the Sino-British trial communication has been running smoothly for up to twenty hours.

<h3>Continuing Sino-Italian Communication</h3>
<p>Furthermore, he stated that since its establishment, the bureau has established communication with more than twelve countries and major commercial ports around the world. After the Sino-British direct communication is fully completed, countries such as Italy, Japan, and India will be considered for continued communication. Due to factual needs, countries like Italy and India have sent people to contact the bureau one after another. Therefore, the bureau has decided to continue with the Sino-Italian communication after the Sino-British communication is completed, because relations between China and Italy have become increasingly close in terms of commerce and everything else recently.</p>

Subsequently, after the expiration of the period, because no order from the Ministry of Railways was received to continue the extension, the bureau's Transportation Department specifically issued a telegram on January 6th, numbered GB344, ordering all stations to temporarily continue the practice. At the same time, the bureau requested instructions from the Ministry of Railways. Subsequently, Instruction No. 20337 was received, stating that the price reduction for the cement should not be continued, etc. The Transportation Department was immediately instructed to cancel the special price from January 7th.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Asks Charitable Organizations to Provide Winter Relief to Poor Households in Civilian Residences</h3>
<p>A Total of 121 People in 68 Poor Households</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that every winter, charitable organizations jointly provide winter relief to poor residents of civilian residences. Therefore, yesterday, it sent a letter to the federation of charitable organizations to handle the matter. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "According to the report from Wang Zhenchang, the general manager of the civilian residences in this city, the various residences have submitted investigation forms for the poor households in each residence, requesting that the winter relief measures be carried out in accordance with previous years to benefit the poor households, etc. According to the statistics of the residences, there are 68 poor households, with a total of 121 people.

It is appropriate to copy the investigation forms and submit them for review and transfer, etc." A copy of the investigation form is attached. "According to this, this bureau has learned that every winter, your organization provides winter relief to the poor people of this place, which is of great benefit to the poor people. Now, according to the previous situation, in addition to the instruction, the corresponding attachments are copied and sent to you for review and handling. Please reply." (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>The Trend of Rent Increase in Shoupin Lane on Huade Road Is About to Expand</h3>
<p>Since receiving letters from the Gao Yi Public House rental office requesting rent increases, the tenants of Shoupin Lane on Huade Road have unanimously decided that in this time of economic depression and social and economic decline, the original rent is already a burden. Now, the rental office, disregarding public opinion, wants to increase the rent by as much as 150%. They commissioned lawyer Yuan Yang'an to reply on their behalf, requesting that the rent increase proposal be withdrawn. Recently, tenants in the lane have reported that the Gao Yi rental office is first threatening to stop paying for the supply of tap water and other expenses, and now is threatening to demolish the houses. Yesterday, the head of the construction team who previously built the houses in the lane came to inspect, and stated that as soon as the notification is received, he will start building bamboo fences, etc. The tenants were shocked upon hearing this. After discussion, they still commissioned lawyer Yuan to represent them and sent letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Municipal Council, asking for help and relief, and publishing the facts of the case in newspapers and soliciting assistance from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Development of Home Electrification</h3>
<p>Everyone marvels at the wide use and great effectiveness of electricity in factories, transportation, and traffic. However, with the advancement of modern science, the use of electricity began with electric lights and gradually increased, leading to the realization of home electrification. Electrification means that everything, big or small, uses electricity to replace the labor of the past. The convenience of electric lights is known to all, and for daily sweeping, there are vacuum cleaners to serve people, which are both clean and hygienic, and convenient and labor-saving. All household necessities, such as irons, floor scrubbers, water boilers, and bread toasters, can use electricity to save laborious work. Electric heating has even greater uses, such as electric stoves in winter, which have no ash and no smoke. Electric stoves in the kitchen make cooking convenient and unparalleled. Electric refrigerators protect food and are unsurpassed. Furthermore, electric water heaters provide a constant supply of hot water all day long. All kinds of electric heating can save the trouble of cleaning up ash and dirt, and have the convenience of obtaining heat in an instant. Therefore, an electrified home can obtain all kinds of advantages such as comfort, hygiene, convenience, and labor-saving. Today, there are no less than tens of millions of families building this kind of home, and it is certain that in the future, it will increase to hundreds of millions.</p>
<h3>The Reaction to the Rent Increase in Penglai Market</h3>
<p>The shops in Penglai Market on Penglai Road in this city were notified by the landlord Kuang Zhongmou that starting from January of the 23rd year [of the Republic], the rent for each room would be increased by five yuan (the rent for the 22nd year was twenty yuan), making each room twenty-five yuan. The tenants strongly opposed this, saying that they could not afford it in this time of economic depression. They elected representatives to negotiate with Kuang to avoid the increase, but to no avail. They had no choice but to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but there was no result. Yesterday afternoon, the tenants held another meeting at the Yingbin Restaurant teahouse in the market, and elected the female owner of Wuzhou Pharmacy, Shu Peizhen, as chairwoman, and Zhou Jianzhai as secretary. They stated that the rent for the 19th year was ten yuan, for the 20th year it was fifteen yuan, for the 21st year it was not increased due to the war, and for the 22nd year it was increased to twenty yuan. This year, they asked the landlord to postpone the increase but were not granted permission. The whole body decided to join the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee and await a public decision. As for the rent for January, it will all be deposited in a bank for safekeeping, and the landlord will only receive the rent after the matter is resolved.</p>
<h3>The Second Zhenru Qingzhen Villa Was Completed Yesterday</h3>
<p>There is an increasing number of Shanghai Muslims traveling to and residing in Shanghai. The Rizhui Port Cemetery in Hebei has already been filled. Although there is vacant land in Henan, it suffers from being low-lying and surrounded by factories, which is gradually becoming unsuitable. In recent years, the religion has purchased a lot of land north of Gujiazhai in the Zhenru area, some for public cemeteries, some for charitable cemeteries, and some for private property. However, the biggest regret is that there is only a cemetery and no mausoleum. When the coffin is brought to the cemetery, there is no place to rest. If it rains or snows, even the mourners have no place to stand. The directors of the Shanghai Qingzhen Board of Directors, Ha Shaofu, Jin Xusheng, Su Zixiang, and Wang Hairu, in view of this, initiated the construction of the Second Qingzhen Villa, continuing and expanding the name of the Rizhui Port Villa. After years of preparation and months of construction, it has now been completed. Yesterday, a completion ceremony was held. Many cars departed from the Fuyou Road Mosque, and about a thousand people attended. Various Muslim organizations sent representatives to participate. The meeting opened at 10:00 AM. First, Imam Ha Desheng was invited to recite the first chapter of the Quran to show the intention of prayer. Next, Imam Da Pusheng gave a lecture on religious doctrine, which was extremely profound. Next, Director Su Zixiang reported on the construction situation and the accounts in great detail, and commemorated the contributions of Jin Xusheng's maternal uncle, Ma Yitang, to the Second Villa, which moved the listeners. Afterwards, guests spoke one after another. After the meeting, refreshments were served, and everyone dispersed happily. On the day, the traffic on the road was heavy, and it was quite a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>Clock Shop on Xinzha Road Robbed</h3>
<p>Time: Yesterday at 5:50 PM</p>
<p>Loot: 100 Watches Worth 1300 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:50 PM, two robbers suddenly arrived at a clock shop at No. 595 Xinzha Road. One robber was unarmed, and the other was armed with a gun. The armed robber entered the shop and shouted at the staff and apprentices in the shop, forbidding them from making any noise, and drove them into a corner to keep them under control. The unarmed robber opened the counter, and all the cash and foreign currency stored inside, totaling 1,300 yuan, were robbed. The robbers were still not satisfied, and opened the clock cabinet, and also robbed 100 valuable wristwatches and pocket watches. They went out and fled. When the staff came out, the robbers had already fled far away. They immediately ran to the Xinzha Police Station to report the incident. The police station sent detectives to investigate the scene and ordered detectives to search and arrest the robbers.</p>
<h3>There Was Snow Again in This City Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been severe for the past week. The temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer has dropped to around 20 degrees. The tap water on the roads and alleys in various places is frozen. Although the sun was seen yesterday morning, the afternoon was suddenly cloudy and densely covered. For a time, snowflakes flew, sometimes sparse and sometimes dense. According to general expectations, it will snow heavily.</p>
<h3>Hu Biao Yong An Tang Establishes a Lending Center for Unemployed Compatriots</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Hu Biao Yong An Tang, invented four kinds of effective medicines, including Tiger Balm, to benefit the world. Based on the charitable spirit of helping the distressed and relieving disasters, he has provided a great deal of assistance to charitable causes abroad. Recently, the national situation has deteriorated, and there are many unemployed people. The owner is deeply saddened by this. Mr. Hu Guiyu, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the hall, is also kind-hearted and willing to help. Seeing that various parties have jointly organized relief efforts for the unemployed, he has undertaken the grand purpose of the hall's owner and independently established a lending center for unemployed compatriots to make a living. Each person only borrows five or ten yuan, which is simple and easy to implement, and provides a lot of assistance. It can be called a savior for the unemployed. The declaration and the simple regulations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration The Shanghai Branch of Hu Biao Yong An Tang Announces the Establishment of a Lending Center for Unemployed Compatriots to Make a Living, stating that in today's world, when economic depression is rampant, the unemployment wave has swept to our country. Not only are the farmers in the countryside economically exhausted, but also the unemployed workers in the cities are numerous. If relief is not sought quickly, people will be trapped by their livelihoods, take risks, and disrupt society, which can shake the foundation of the country. Although the way to relieve the situation depends on the fundamental plans of the government and cooperation, we cannot turn a blind eye. In view of this, this hall has taken the liberty of establishing a lending center for unemployed compatriots to make a living, with the general office located at the Shanghai branch of this hall, and branch offices located at the general agency offices and special management offices in various foreign ports. Several provisional borrowing regulations have been drawn up and published below, so that the unemployed can borrow this to earn a little for clothing and food, and avoid the urgency of hunger and cold. It is clear that a drop in the bucket is of no avail, but if society has one less unemployed person, then the country will have one more law-abiding person. We dare not talk about the fundamental way to solve the problem, but the superficial plan will definitely have a slight effect. At the beginning of the establishment, there are many imperfections, and we hope that experts will not hesitate to give guidance.</p>
<p>Simple Regulations Simple Regulations of the Lending Center for Unemployed Compatriots to Make a Living Attached to the Shanghai Branch of Hu Biao Yong An Tang. 1. The name of this office is the Lending Center for Unemployed Compatriots to Make a Living Attached to the Shanghai Branch of Hu Biao Yong An Tang. 2. The purpose of this office is to relieve unemployed compatriots and help them open up a way to make a living. 3. The general office is located at the Shanghai branch of Hu Biao Yong An Tang, and the branch offices are located at the general agency offices and special management offices of this hall in various places. 4. Any citizen of the Republic of China who is over 18 years old and under 50 years old, physically fit and hardworking, has no bad habits, and is truly capable of making a living but has lost the opportunity to make a living, regardless of gender, can borrow a livelihood fund of 5 to 10 yuan from this office. However, this borrowing can only be used to sell Tiger Balm products and cannot be used for other purposes. 5. When borrowing money, in addition to the borrower filling out a voluntary application, a reliable shop must be found as a guarantor. 6. The borrowing limit is temporarily set at 300 people in this city and 50 people in each foreign port. If necessary, the situation may be considered and the amount may be increased. 7. The loan is to be repaid interest-free within six months. If it cannot be repaid by the due date, the guarantor will be pursued. 8. If the first loan is repaid, and you want to borrow again, you should submit another guarantee. 9. The borrower must report the sales situation to this office every day and add new goods with the money earned. If the performance is excellent, a bonus will be awarded after six months to encourage them. 10. If the borrower stops selling Tiger Balm products midway due to an event, they must report to this office and return the borrowed money. If the products have not been sold out, the products can be converted into cash. 11. If the borrower uses the name to deceive or cause trouble outside, once verified, the borrowed money will be recovered from the guarantor. If the circumstances are serious, legal sanctions will be taken. 12. If these simple regulations are found to be imperfect, they may be modified by this office and notified.</p>
<p>Note Tiger Balm products are effective in treating diseases and have been widely praised as essential items for home and travel. Therefore, they are easy to sell and do not require a large amount of capital. For example, borrowing six yuan from this office can purchase one dozen each of iron box Tiger Balm, Bagua Dan, and Headache Powder. Using one day's time, you can sell them in the alleys, residential areas, wharves, stations, or teahouses, restaurants, bathhouses, and theaters. At a minimum, you can sell the above goods, earning two yuan for each yuan of profit, which is an income of one yuan and two jiao. And if an unemployed person sells medicines, they will surely be deeply sympathetic to the buyers, giving great convenience to the sales. Those who have tasted the bitterness of unemployment may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Another report states that Tiger Balm is effective in treating frostbite, according to those who have used it, so the sales of this oil have recently increased sharply. The hall has telegraphed the Shantou factory to send a large batch, which is expected to arrive in this city soon.</p>
<h3>Two Months of Economic Cooperation Movement</h3>
<p>Initiated by the China Economic Credit Cooperative</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative has been established for almost three months. Through the efforts of Zhang Shouyong, the chairman of the cooperative, and all members, the affairs of the cooperative have developed rapidly. In view of the fact that the public is not very aware of cooperative undertakings, it is planned to hold an economic cooperation movement for two months starting from the first of next month. Participating and sponsoring organizations include the Guangye Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Federation, and the Shanghai First District Citizens' Federation. Central figures such as Chairman Lin, President Wang, Secretary-General Chu, Minister Kong, Minister Chen, and Minister Zhu, as well as Shanghai figures such as Mayor Wu, Director Wu, Director Pan, and business giants Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, are all participating and sponsoring. Famous people will be invited to give speeches at that time, and contact will be made with major newspapers to publish special issues to explain economic cooperation. In addition, the "Overview" recently edited by the cooperative has been printed. Individual reading requires a postage of two jiao, which is sent to the group for free. If cooperative members want to read it, they only need to pay a postage of five fen.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Controls Market Expansion of Chinese Cotton Cloth with Capital</h3>
<p>The China National Cotton Cloth Market is the textile and cloth barrier that followed the iron and steel barrier, with the purpose of relieving hand-made cotton cloth workers and resisting Japanese yarn and cloth. Later, due to the lack of capital and the inadequacy of the original address and manpower, it was difficult to cope with the environment. Therefore, enthusiastic people in the cotton cloth industry rose to the occasion. It is now reported that the two sides held a meeting on January 18th at the Shanghai Municipal Local Coordination Council to discuss the capital increase plan. It was decided to organize an expansion initiation meeting and expand the capital to 250,000 yuan to show their spirit of perseverance.</p>
<h3>The Results of the Two Railway Bureau's Retest for Reserve Trainees Are Announced</h3>
<p>A Total of Fifteen People, Including Li Zhiao, Were Selected</p>
<p>In order to prudently select talents in advance for the purpose of supplementing the vacant staff in various sections and stations at any time, the Transportation Department of the Two Railways specifically appointed responsible personnel to establish a "Employee Examination Committee for Transportation Affairs" and held the first examination for reserve trainees on the 11th of this month. A total of seventeen people passed the test, with seventeen formally admitted and three on the waiting list. They immediately reported to the director and deputy director of the bureau. Subsequently, Secretary Fan Shouzhi, Sun Shaojie, and Xiao Weiguo were appointed to hold a retest on the 15th together with Zhang Zexiong, director of the Cadre Stock of the Personnel Section. The questions were divided into Chinese, English, and oral exams. Finally, the Health Section conducted a physical examination. As a result, the following fifteen people were selected: Li Zhiao, Wu Yuankan, Qi Qilin, Zhu Yonglin, Zheng Da, Xu Ganyun, Shen Jie, Xiang Renhe, Zhong Wenwei, Xu Xiang, Diao Ping, Shu Bangrong, Cai Jinshou, Cao Shaosong, and Meng Zhaolou. Among them, Li Guangao has myopia, which would normally disqualify him. However, because his retest scores in each item were exceptionally excellent, ranking first in all of them, he was specially admitted.</p>
<h3>The National Traditional Medicine Industry's Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>The national traditional medicine industry believes that in recent years, foreign forces have invaded, greatly affecting the traditional medicine industry, and there is a lack of people to promote it and no help for improvement. It specially sent representatives Chen Xunqi, Ding Haoying, Cai Tonghao, Fang Ningjian, and others, totaling more than 50 people, and the entire medical and pharmaceutical community in the capital, to the Central Party Headquarters to petition, requesting a clear order for equal treatment between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, etc., and there was even a threat to collectively strike if the goal was not achieved. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency went to inquire yesterday about the leaders of the traditional medicine industry in this city, and their remarks are as follows:</p>
<h3>Seeking Improvement Through Equal Treatment</h3>
<p>According to the talk, a certain member of the Central Committee once proposed abolishing traditional Chinese medicine, which would not only be an insult to national essence, but also affect the welfare of the people. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are determined to ask the central government to maintain it and present various points in detail to seek promotion from a high position, issue a clear order for equal treatment with Western medicine, and benefit the development of the national medicine industry. The representatives are determined that if they cannot get what they want, they will only resort to the final strike to fight for the way out for traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<h3>Petition Representatives Return Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>The traditional medicine industry in this city sent representatives Cai Tonghao, Cen Zhiliang, and Fei Yongzu to Beijing to participate in the petition. The matter has now been completed and they have returned to Shanghai. The results of the petition are generally satisfactory. The Secretariat of the Congress expressed its acceptance of all points of the request and agreed to submit them to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>The Southwest Responds with Perseverance and Striving for Survival</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Southwest also telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing, proposing to stipulate equal treatment between Chinese and Western medicine, and other places have continued to express their support for the petition. However, traditional Chinese medicine does have some shortcomings, and practitioners are now determined to find ways to improve, persevere, and strive for survival.</p>
<h3>The Directorate General of Posts Announces Continued Acceptance of Ordinary Mail to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>However, Air Mail is Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Surface Mail to Blocked Areas Will Be Forwarded</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications announced that because the turmoil in Xinjiang has not yet ended, the postal routes have been cut off, and mail cannot be delivered. All air mail via the Eurasian Aviation Company's Northwest Line had been previously announced to be temporarily suspended. However, because the remaining ordinary mail can still be sent, and as for the blocked locations, the bureau specifically issued a notice stating, "It has been found that the postal routes in Xinjiang are completely blocked, and mail communication has been suspended. All kinds of mail to Xinjiang received by the post office before are now temporarily滞留en route and cannot be delivered. Except for airmail that needs to be delivered via the航綫 west of Gaolan, which should be temporarily suspended, the post office can still accept ordinary mail to Xinjiang that is not airmail, and transport it to the blocked locations first. As soon as the postal routes are restored, it will be forwarded immediately. This is announced to the public." Postmaster Zha Peilin.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Railway Bureau to Open the Iron Gate in Front of Kenghai Road on the Railway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Two Railways Administration yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, on the 21st of this month, we received a letter from the Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Association stating that according to reports from a large number of factory worker members, there was a convenient gate on the opposite side of the iron gate on the boundary road of the North Railway Station near Kenghai Road. Recently, for some unknown reason, the railway police used wire to block the gate. Although there is a main entrance, it is dozens of steps away. The [convenient gate] will only be opened when the train is about to depart. Therefore, it is inconvenient. Shanghai is a major port for Chinese and foreign communication. Except for times when the situation is unstable and martial law is ordered, such a phenomenon may occur. Now that the situation is peaceful, why is there such a situation suddenly? Please kindly ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request the Municipal Government and the Railway Administration to quickly open [the gate] to facilitate transportation, etc." According to this, the Standing Committee of the association decided to submit a letter to the Railway Bureau, requesting that the matter be investigated and that the Municipal Government and the Railway Administration be allowed to open [the gate], which would be a great service. We have found that there was an open gate on the boundary road of the North Railway Station near Kenghai Road, which was convenient for pedestrians. Once closed, not only is transportation hindered, but also passengers taking the train are inconvenienced. Is it possible to open it as usual to facilitate transportation? According to the foregoing situation, we hereby send a letter to your bureau for investigation and reply.</p>

<h3>The Dredging Bureau Sends Personnel to Germany to Supervise the Construction of a Dredger</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau needs a large drawer or automatic dredging wheel to open up the灘 outside the Wusong Estuary. Because there is no such large shipyard in our country, it has ordered one from a certain steel factory in Germany, with a construction cost of about 4.8 million yuan and a one-year term. If the performance is excellent, a second one will be ordered. It is now reported that the bureau's chief engineer, Zha Deli, in order to understand the machinery of the wheel, has specially sent mechanical foreign engineer Smith, Chinese engineer Zhu Zhongxi, and one technician from the Hydrographic Survey Bureau to Germany to supervise the construction.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Recently, your esteemed newspaper published an article about the Taikoo Shanghai-Hankou-Wusong steamer company's expulsion of middle-class workers last year. The article stated that the Seamen's Union had scheduled a general meeting of representatives of various ships at the Middle-Class Public Office on February 1 to discuss the entire plan. This is inconsistent with the facts. The Seamen's Union had already established appropriate measures for the Wusong steamer case, but Taikoo refused to accept them, so it has been delayed until now. We are currently actively negotiating. As for the representatives' meeting on February 1, it was initiated and convened by our office to rectify all internal affairs of our department and has nothing to do with the Wusong steamer case. I hope you will check and correct this. Sincerely, Zhou Xiaoting, Wei Xie Sheng, and Wang Ou Min, Standing Committee Members of the Jianghai Steamer Middle-Class Public Office, January 22.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Yesterday, we received a copy each of the 30th issue of the Children's Pictorial, the 66th issue of the English Weekly, and the 2nd issue of the 32nd volume of the Children's World from the Commercial Press. We also received a copy of the 833rd issue of the Bank Weekly from the Bank Weekly. We also received a copy of the 1st issue of the 14th volume of the Money Industry Monthly from the Money Industry Association. We express our gratitude here.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Train Our Brains (1)</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>After reading the articles in your column on the 13th and 14th, I was awakened, because I am someone who is "lost in the sea of learning, not knowing what to choose" and "wants to study Einstein's theory of relativity without even understanding elementary algebra." Therefore, when I accidentally want to learn a certain subject, the result is always that I retreat because the "subject is too specialized." I have bought many natural science books, but because I don't have the corresponding basic knowledge, I end up wasting money. Now I am raising a reading question, and I ask you to reply to me with a letter.</p>
<p>Now, I will first describe my personality, environment, etc., so that you can understand me.</p>
<p>(1) Personality: I am a person with low intelligence, fond of low-level interests, often having pointless fantasies and delusions, and also careless, cowardly, and slow. When I was in school, my math grades were often failing, but I did very well in memorizing and writing Chinese and English. I am not interested in sports.</p>
<p>(2) Level: I dropped out of the old system of middle school in the second grade to go into business. While in school, I did not understand math at all. After leaving school, because of self-motivation, I actually completed an arithmetic textbook on my own (half of the credit goes to the detailed answer explanations). I wanted to pursue algebra, but it was too difficult, so I stopped halfway. Then I started to study English on my own and it was very effective. Because I finished Li Taen's English reader on the Three People's Principles, I already had some ability to read English newspapers. Therefore, I continued to work hard. Now, for the Miller's Review and ordinary English literature books, I can read them as long as I have a dictionary in hand. For things that are easy to understand, I often like to translate them into Chinese. I am very interested in Nash's Grammar Fourth Book. Because I am often with English books, I have a habitual fondness for English.</p>
<p>Environment: I work as an accountant in a shop in a rural town, earning a few dozen yuan a month. English is of no use here, but my personality is the opposite.</p>
<p>Hope: Because I am good at low-level interests, after repeated efforts to reform, reading famous Western literary works and biographies of historical figures, etc., I have gradually changed my inferior thoughts. But I hope to cultivate a brain that is organized, rigorous, sensitive, and sound. I dare not have any ambitions, I only hope to be qualified to be someone who understands the times, a healthy citizen, and a people with a scientific mind.</p>
<p>What I am asking for guidance here is: (1) What subject will make my brain rigorous and sound, sensitive, and eliminate pointless reverie and delusions?</p>
<p>(2) Logic can organize our thoughts, but can someone who has not learned algebra and geometry understand it on their own?</p>
<p>(3) Is it better to learn formal logic or dialectical logic?</p>
<p>(4) Should I give up English and pursue other urgently needed subjects because I am afraid that "in the end, I will not be proficient in foreign languages, and I will not gain anything from the subjects I want to read"? (Letter from Xu Lezhen)</p>
<p>Mail forwarding: 1. Yao Tianyou, Shi Renjun: Please indicate a communication address so that we can reply by letter.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>On Success and Failure</h3>
<p>— Ban Shun</p>
<p>Whether I can accomplish an ideal event depends on whether I have a strong will and ability. Of course, this seems to be a "cliché," so why should I dwell on it? However, if we observe from a philosophical perspective, there is still room for discussion.</p>
<p>The ancients said it well: "Where there's a will, there's a way." Then, this is what is called "success." At the same time, there is a saying: "Pride comes before a fall." This is what is called "failure!" Let us look at the former's so-called spirit, which is a kind of "cultivation" of a certain event. Using this kind of cultivation to concentrate and work, there is no doubt that nothing cannot be accomplished. However, if there is no cultivation under this statement, and one cannot be as calm as an old monk in meditation, then even if his spirit is concentrated, it will inevitably overflow. Without cultivation, one's energy will inevitably overflow. It is true that it is like a young monk who is difficult to attain enlightenment, and it is not easy to succeed in a great undertaking, which is a pity. At the same time, the word "overflow" also means "to show it to the outside." To show it to the outside is pride. Pride is the overflow of energy. As the Shanghainese say, "not up to par," then failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the success or failure of a career depends entirely on whether people have a unified spirit. No matter what they do, as long as they are "enthusiastic," it is not difficult to judge their success or failure. The so-called "enthusiasm" here, in popular terms, is "dedication," which is also the meaning of "unified spirit." The unification of spirit lies in the result of "deliberate attention." This deliberate attention is essential for us and is a kind of perseverance. Only with perseverance can there be a manifestation of genius. If one is self-proclaimed a genius but lacks the will of perseverance, it is also in vain. Especially young people with vigorous blood, many lack the concentration of attention; otherwise, with the self-mastery of not moving or being confused, the attention of not yielding or being intimidated, and the absence of fear of difficulty or complacency, hum! hum! I guarantee you will succeed immediately.</p>
<p>Therefore, in discussing the "success or failure" of a career, the arrival and unification of the spirit is a necessary process for a great undertaking; otherwise, it is difficult to succeed. Therefore, I have written this essay on success and failure to appeal to those who sympathize.</p>
<h3>Laziness</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>We Chinese people used to be in the limelight and contributed to culture. Each era has its own spirit, so we boasted of being the "Celestial Kingdom," the king of the world, and the rest were barbarians and insignificant countries. But now, we are looked down upon by foreigners. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Originally, our people suffer from a disease, which is "laziness!"</p>
<p>Our people do not like to interfere in other people's affairs. Everyone is afraid of trouble. The bad ideas of "one thing less is better than one thing more" and "sweep the snow in front of your own door and don't care about the frost on other people's roof" are deeply imprinted in their minds. This bad psychology of "too lazy to care about other people's affairs" allows traitors, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry to act illegally and do all kinds of evil. China is suffering from an incurable internal disease.</p>
<p>Our people are too lazy to interact with others, so there is no unity. It's like a pile of loose sand. Someone said, "Accumulate sand into a tower," but sand has no "stickiness" and cannot be a tower. It's like people lacking emotion cannot accomplish anything. Our people lack this emotion - the spirit of cooperation - so there is no great undertaking, let alone development.</p>
<p>Our people get by as best they can, and one day is counted as two and a half days. This lazy mentality leads to a lack of creativity. When they see that other people's things are selling well, they make counterfeit brands. Even if you get away with it, how is our own thing compared to others? Our people know how to enjoy themselves, but they cannot endure hardship. They are too lazy to do anything. They cannot build airplanes, they cannot build trains, they cannot build guns and cannons... They buy what other people have discarded. How can they compete with others? How can they fight with others? How can China become rich and strong?</p>
<p>One national humiliation after another is coming. Our generous people, who can support a boat in their stomachs, are too lazy to argue with others. But, compatriots! Do we have to wait until the fire is burning our eyebrows, or when we have to shit, we cannot but shit to realize that we cannot do this?</p>
<h3>The Leisure Class</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>People who are unwilling to work and do not have to work are called the "leisure class." Originally, people all hated work and loved leisure, but because of the pressure of hunger and cold, people have to rack their brains and shed blood and sweat to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>The "leisure class" outside the labor circle will not experience the panic of hunger and cold. They have money to solve all problems. Their lives are too idle! So they have to come up with all kinds of entertainment methods to dissipate this excess time.</p>
<p>"Those who sit idly by cannot eat." Although the book clearly tells us this, some people witness that the "leisure class" can not only sit idly by and eat, but also sit idly by and enjoy all the pleasures (?). Then the psychology of "getting something for nothing" arises! All kinds of evils in society also arise!</p>
<p>The laboring people are too laborious, and the leisurely people are too leisurely. This forms an inverse proportion, which is the struggle of classes. It would be best if people could all become the "leisure class." Then it would be comfortable, but all production would be cut off. What kind of world would this be!</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 23: The Pain is Unbearable, Concentrating on Listening to the Music; The Joy is Not Satisfied, Hastening Farewell with Flying Talismans.</p>
<p>This day at noon, several wooden pillars were erected on their roof, and people were setting up a shed there. According to Beijing custom, when people have weddings, funerals, or birthday celebrations, they must erect and set up a shed in the yard, so that they can use it as a temporary auditorium under the shed, which is commonly called "handling affairs." The family across the street had no one celebrating a birthday, no one giving birth to a child, and no one dying. This must be a wedding. If there was to be a wedding, then naturally, Zhao Ziqiang had returned home, and Guizhi was getting married. With such an omen, the number of times he went out for a walk each day increased. The next morning, after washing, he seemed to be urged by someone, and immediately ran outside the gate, looking at the passers-by. But he didn't need to think too much. On the gate of the Zhao family, there was a piece of bright red and dazzling material with words written on it, namely "Auspicious Match, Marital Harmony." Above the door frame, there was also a red paper horizontal plaque, namely "The Star of Happiness Shines High." When Ji Zhi saw it, he couldn't help but sneer. The meaning was, what is an auspicious match, does anyone in the Zhao family still have Gan Zhi in their heart? As for marital harmony, hum! I don't think there will be such a day. As long as Zhao Ziqiang doesn't drop his gun, he can't live the life of a couple at home. He criticized the festive couplet in secret, but he refused to leave and stood in the doorway of his own gate to watch the excitement of other people's families. At this time, a person who specializes in handling tea and water for people's affairs set up a tea stove as big as a vat at the entrance of the Zhao family, and five red lacquer carved tea tables were placed on one side. Above it was a glass frame, and below it was a printed tablecloth. Hundreds of teapots and teacups were placed on the table. This is also a peculiar custom of the old capital. When people have happy events, they specially find this kind of person to manage the tea and water. Ordinary people put this kind of arrangement outside the gate. Although this is said to avoid taking up space in the yard, it is actually a kind of show-off, so that people know there are many guests. (298)</p>
<h3>Vendor of Wonton Soup</h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>Hearing the distant clacking sound of the wonton vendor's bamboo instrument... my stomach felt a pang of hunger, and I hurriedly opened the door to await his arrival.</p>
<p>It was indeed early winter: at night, before ten o'clock, the streets already appeared strangely desolate and lonely. Only the late-night congee shops, due to their business needs, were still standing alone in this cold wind. All other shops were quietly closed. Looking from one side of the street to the other, one could hardly spot a soul. Occasionally, someone would pass by, their head and neck shrunk in, their face sallow—obviously just out of their warm home. The northwest wind came in gusts, now tight, now slack, terribly cold, and blowing on me, I couldn't help but shiver!</p>
<p>Under the dim, yellowish street lamp, I saw him carrying his heavy-looking shoulder pole, walking step by step!</p>
<p>After a round of calls, he set down his pole. A smile spread across his weathered face as he asked, "Sir, how many would you like?" His accent was not like the locals, even though he was trying, it sounded strangely grating. "Thirty will do!" I said, handing him the bowl.</p>
<p>So, he began his work. Seizing the opportunity during this idle time, driven by curiosity, I casually asked, "You've been doing this business for many years!"</p>
<p>"Almost four years now," he replied, as he placed the wontons into the pot.</p>
<p>"Your accent doesn't sound like a local; where did you move from?"</p>
<p>This was an unintentional question, but it touched a sore spot for this middle-aged man. He sighed, "Ah, sir, you don't know! My hometown was originally in Jiangxi, but the Communists destroyed it all! My wife and children are scattered, and I'm all alone, drifting to this place. This business, from dusk till late at night, is not fit for a human! The more he spoke, the more agitated he became, almost shedding tears.</p>
<p>After hearing his words, what way could I find to comfort him?</p>
<p>When he had cooked the wontons and handed them to me, he picked up his pole and left! I stood there blankly, watching the silhouette of this wanderer gradually disappear under the lamplight. A feeling of immense melancholy arose in my heart. May God forever bless this lonely soul!</p>

<p>Global Oddities</p>
<p>— Chen Donglin</p>
<h3>The Funeral of a Foot</h3>
<p>In Budapest, the capital of Hungary, a man named Marius Tiamon recently held a bizarre funeral for his foot. His right foot had contracted a stroke, so he followed the doctor's advice and had it amputated. However, according to Jewish religious customs, "Any part of the body that dies accidentally should be buried." Therefore, he followed this rule and placed the foot in a coffin, held a grand funeral, and buried it in the earth amidst the pastor's sorrowful prayers. It is said that this man cried loudly for a while during the burial. This can be said to be the world's most peculiar funeral.</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Original Price of Virginity</h3>
<p>Recently, a great commotion has arisen in the Sden region of Africa over marriage based on purchase. According to local customs, buying a bride requires fifteen head of cattle, but due to the recent poor climate, ordinary people of the non-propertied class cannot afford fifteen head of cattle. In light of this, the Sden government, in order to make marriage "popular," implemented a "social policy" of reducing the price of brides. As a result, the women of Sden were furious, posting slogans everywhere such as, "Maintain the original price of virginity," "Absolutely oppose price reductions," "The government should resign," and so on, and held large-scale demonstrations. They even planned to hold a national convention of virgins, making a great commotion. On the other hand, the proletarian youths launched a fierce opposition movement, leading to bloody clashes with the women. It is said that the government is currently still considering the matter.</p>
<h3>God's Address</h3>
<p>Seven years ago, a curious person in Leipzig, Germany, mailed a letter, with "God" written on the envelope. The local post office forwarded the letter to various places such as Rome, Greece, and Palestine, but the letter was recently returned to the sender's location. A slip of paper was attached to the letter, reading, "Addressee unknown"! Atheists were overjoyed to hear about this. And the letter with the attached note was bought by a wealthy man for five hundred marks.</p>
<h3>A Century-Long Plan</h3>
<p>The government of Angola recently resolved that officials who marry women from other countries will be dismissed, but the article of the decree notes: "If the woman from the other country is wealthy, then it can be tacitly approved." This can be said to be the humor of the Angolan government.</p>
<h3>Island Without Germs</h3>
<p>According to a recent conversation with Dr. Spinton, who returned to London after exploring Tristan da Cunha Island in the Arctic Ocean, although the island only has 150 residents, there has never been a patient on the island, so there is not even a doctor.</p>
<h3>Doctor of Sound Effects</h3>
<p>Recently, a very rare scholar appeared in the United States, named C. S. E. E. After investigation, it was found that this is an abbreviation for Doctor of Sound Effect Engineering. It means a Doctor of Sound Effects Engineering. His skill is to use musical instruments or other objects in front of the broadcasting station to produce sounds such as trains, footsteps, waterfalls, rain, waves, and the cries of animals and ghosts. It is said that this Doctor of Sound Effects is the first degree of its kind in the world.</p>
<h3>Strange Commemorative Statue</h3>
<p>Recently, a very peculiar commemorative statue was erected in a certain large park in Moscow. From the front it looks like Marx, from the right side it looks like Stalin, and from the left side it looks like Lenin! The intention is simply to mechanically place the three great founders of the Soviet Union together, so as to combine them into one!</p>

<h3>Great Expansion in Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou, 23rd) The Guangdong authorities have now decided to step up the implementation of the plan to expand Zhongshan University. One of them is to build a new campus in Xiaobei with a huge sum of 20 million yuan. The general outline of the plan has already been implemented. Several new school buildings have been built on the spacious campus of about 9,600 acres. As of now, 223,814 feet of roads have been built on the campus, but due to lack of cash, other plans have not been fully implemented. President Zou Lu has asked the members of the Central Committee attending the Fourth Plenary Session to assist, so that the plan can be realized as soon as possible. It is said that the establishment of this school is purely to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, so the party members should do their best to promote the expansion plan so that it can be realized. It is said that one of the proposals of Guangdong Province to the Plenary Session is to suggest that the government immediately allocate 2.5 million yuan for the construction of the Zhongshan University campus, and at the same time, the Guangdong Customs should allocate 100,000 yuan per month as a subsidy.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Education in Anhui Province (3)</h3>
<p>| Inspection Report by the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, Li Ximou |</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, there are 131 public schools in various counties in Anhui Province. The Provincial Department of Education is actively urging its subordinate educational institutions at all levels to establish public schools as much as possible to promote public education. (The "Overview of the Promotion of Public Education in Anhui Province" compiled by the Anhui Provincial Department of Education is omitted here). The Anhui Provincial Department of Education has the following opinions on promoting public education: (1) The Provincial Department has achieved remarkable results in sorting out local education funds in previous years. According to the Provincial Department, local education funds in various counties should be thoroughly investigated and sorted out, and all the increased income should be used to expand the first phase of compulsory education and short-term compulsory education. (2) Compulsory education funds in the province have always been special funds, but in many counties, they have been used for other purposes. In the future, strict rectification and restrictions should be imposed so that all compulsory education special funds are used for compulsory education. (3) In various counties and villages in the province, it is rare to find thirty or forty households concentrated in one place. Therefore, village private schools can better adapt to environmental requirements and are more developed than primary schools. In the future, the promotion of compulsory education in rural areas should mainly focus on improving private schools. (4) According to the Provincial Department of Education, those who run education in various counties in the province usually only deal with official documents and respond to higher-level agencies. In the future, the implementation of compulsory education should strictly implement the assessment regulations for county magistrates and education directors. When provincial supervisors inspect various districts, they should also conduct practical assessments, and give awards and punishments to those responsible for education.</p>
<p>(7) The current situation of female secondary education. Judging from the number of existing schools, female secondary education does not seem to be very developed, but the demand for female secondary education is very urgent. For example, the Hefei No. 6 Girls' Middle School has been established for only a few years, and the increase in students every year has already shown one aspect of it. In terms of vocational subjects, there are subjects such as dyeing and weaving, sericulture, and embroidery, but household subjects such as sewing and cooking are not valued. There are currently six girls' middle schools in Anhui, each with three classes in senior high school and normal school. There are only two female secondary vocational schools, one in Anqing and one in Shouxian. The No. 4 Girls' Middle School has three vocational classes. According to the current economic situation of the province, the expansion of female secondary education is quite difficult. However, the Provincial Department of Education plans to establish a girls' middle school in Huailian, northern Anhui, in the 24th year. The current plan to change the setup of the girls' middle school is listed below: "First District" Anqing Girls' Middle School (newly reorganized) (central Anhui), Anqing Girls' Normal School (newly reorganized) Anqing Girls' Vocational School Embroidery Department will be closed and set up a sericulture and dyeing and weaving department, Anqing Girls' Midwifery School (planned to be established), "Second District" Huizhou Normal School (newly established), Huizhou Girls' Junior Middle School (gradually stopping enrollment of the normal school department of the Fourth Middle School), "Third District" Yingzhou Normal School (reorganized from the new Fifth Girls' Middle School and the senior high school department of the Third Middle School) Yingzhou Girls' Junior Middle School (reorganized from the Fifth Middle School), "Fourth District" Xuancheng Normal School (reorganized from the senior high school department of the Fourth Middle School, gradually stopping enrollment of the general department) (southern Anhui), Wuhu Girls' Middle School (reorganized from the Second Girls' Middle School, gradually stopping enrollment of the normal school department), Wuhu Private Vocational School (sewing and sock knitting are very suitable for social needs), "Fifth District" Fengyang Vocational School (reorganized from the Fifth Middle School) (central northern Anhui), the junior middle school department affiliated with Fengyang Normal School Huaiyuan Girls' Middle School (planned to be established in the 26th year, after its establishment, Fengyang Girls' Junior Middle School will be closed immediately), "Sixth District" Luzhou Girls' Junior Middle School (reestablished from the Sixth Girls' Middle School)</p>
<p>Luzhou Normal School (reorganized from the Sixth Girls' Middle School) Shouzhou Girls' Junior Vocational School of Engineering (the sewing department is changed to the home industry department).</p>

Regarding the appointment of faculty members, the Provincial Department of Education has issued a form for faculty members to the provincial secondary schools, ordering each school to open a detailed resume of qualified personnel and submit it for verification. Faculty members who have not been approved by the Provincial Department of Education may not issue a formal employment contract.

(5) The number of faculty members in secondary schools: The number of staff stipulated in the budget for this year in secondary schools in Anhui Province has</p>
<p>Compared with the 7th year, the number of staff has been reduced. As for the staff of county-run private secondary schools, the Provincial Department of Education also strictly reviews them when each school submits an outline budget and a list of faculty members. (6) The establishment of single-line laws and regulations and methods for secondary schools: The Education Department has now drafted methods for reviewing the income and expenditure of secondary school funds, methods for managing and awarding and punishing discipline, methods for calculating academic performance, the amount of student fees to be collected, scholarship methods, methods for faculty training, faculty salary scales, methods for increasing annual merit pay, and standards for subsidizing county private secondary schools, and submitted them to the Legal Committee of the Department for review. (B) "Matters concerning general middle schools", (1) The setting of vocational subjects in middle schools: The equipment in middle schools in the province is mostly simple, and vocational subjects have not yet been set up. It is now planned to actively increase the equipment in each school from this year so that it can be added as appropriate. (2) Middle schools also run spring semester classes. Very few primary schools and junior middle schools in the province run spring semester classes. The budget for this year has been approved. It may be impossible for middle schools in the province to add spring semester classes in the next semester. It is now planned to make a decision when compiling the outline budget for the 23rd year. (C) "Matters concerning normal schools", (1) The independent establishment of normal schools and the correction of names are in progress.

(D) "Matters concerning vocational schools", (1) The separate establishment of vocational schools: Except for the provincial No. 4 Girls' Middle School, which has three classes in the junior vocational department, the provincial and county private secondary vocational schools in Anhui Province are all separately established. (2) Matters concerning the establishment of departments in vocational schools: The province plans to set up a farm in Sixian from the 23rd year to recruit training classes. The expenses will be subsidized by the province by half, and the rest will be raised by the commissioner. A forestry training class is also planned to be attached to the East Flow Education Public Forest Farm. From the 23rd year, Taihu and Fuyang counties will be assisted by the province by half to set up farms and training classes. The county private secondary vocational schools in the province, such as Hefei, Woyang, and Fuyang, are all single-department schools, but the Wuhu Private Anhui Vocational School has both mechanical and dyeing and weaving departments. (3) Matters concerning urging counties to set up junior vocational schools and encouraging private individuals to set up vocational schools: The province has stipulated methods for rewarding county-run vocational schools when formulating standards for subsidizing county private secondary schools. As for the existing county private middle schools, the province has strictly urged them to change to vocational schools in accordance with the order.

In addition, the province paid special attention to this point when reviewing the outline budget of local education funds in each county this year, and issued separate instructions to correct it. (2) Unifying the names of primary schools: The provincial primary schools in the province are now named after place names. Private schools always use proper names. The experimental primary schools of the provincial middle schools and normal schools have also been renamed as affiliated primary schools of certain middle schools.

<h3>Shandong Province Will Open a Middle School Principal Meeting</h3>

<h3>Regarding the Resolution of the Current Student Unrest at Kwang Hua University</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Dispatches Zheng Hongnian to Nanyang to Inspect Education</p>
<p>Principal's Position Temporarily Held by Shen Pengfei</p>
<p>Stern Punishment Determined for Students Who Initiated the Unrest</p>
<p>Further Disturbances Will Be Reported to the Government for Severe Action</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon to Rectify School Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 23rd) Sun Ke, Executive Director of the Kwang Hua University Board of Trustees, wrote to the Ministry of Education, stating that the Board of Trustees held a meeting on the 19th to discuss and resolve the current student unrest. It was decided to send Principal Zheng to Nanyang to inspect overseas Chinese education and raise funds for Kwang Hua University. During his absence, the Ministry of Education is requested to send personnel to maintain school affairs and investigate and severely punish the students who initiated the unrest. The matter is duly recorded and submitted to the authorities for review and action.</p>
<p>Shen Pengfei Appointed as Acting Principal: Ministry of Education Announces on the 23rd</p>
<p>A Ministry order to Kwang Hua University states, in brief, that Principal Zheng Hongnian is being dispatched by the Ministry to Nanyang to inspect education and raise funds. All duties of the principal will be temporarily held by Shen Pengfei. At the same time, the Kwang Hua University Board of Trustees is requested to promptly designate representatives to join Ministry-appointed personnel to investigate and severely punish the students who initiated the unrest. On the 23rd, the Ministry of Education ordered Director-General of General Affairs Lei Zhen and President of Tongji University Weng Zhilong that the student unrest at Kwang Hua University has been ongoing for nearly two months, and the actions of some students have greatly exceeded the norm, causing deep distress. Without strict punishment, academic integrity cannot be restored. The Director-General and the President are hereby dispatched to join representatives of the school's Board of Trustees and the Dean of Academic Affairs to conduct a thorough investigation and report to the Ministry for review and action. The new Principal of Kwang Hua University, Shen Pengfei, stated that he would comply with the Ministry's order to go to Shanghai soon and expects to arrive at the school within a month to take office. The situation at Kwang Hua University is complex, and how to reorganize it will depend on the actual situation after arriving at the school, and then deliberate. It is heard that the position of Director of Higher Education at the Ministry of Education is vacant and will be temporarily filled by a Councilor. However, the candidate has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Minister Wang Speaks: Minister of Education Wang Shijie stated that the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have each sent personnel to investigate the current student unrest at Kwang Hua University. When reporters visited Minister Wang yesterday to inquire about the Ministry of Education's handling of the situation at Kwang Hua University, he said that the actions of some students during this unrest have greatly exceeded the norm. In recent years, the government has been striving to improve funding, facilities, and curriculum for various schools. Most schools have shown significant improvement in discipline compared to the past. However, Kwang Hua University has still experienced such a severe unrest, which is deeply regrettable. The existence of Kwang Hua University is of great importance. On the one hand, it provides a more convenient opportunity for overseas Chinese to study. On the other hand, it can maintain and foster the overseas Chinese's love for their motherland and their enthusiasm for the government. Only as a last resort would the Ministry be willing to see the school become unmanageable or be dissolved due to this student unrest. The school's Board of Trustees has also been very cautious in handling this matter. The Ministry has now decided to handle it according to the Board of Trustees' resolution. The students of the school should immediately realize this and restore the school to normal as soon as possible. If there are still disturbances, the Ministry, in order to establish a good academic atmosphere throughout the country, will not hesitate to request the government to take the most severe measures.</p>

<h3>Students of the National Shanghai Medical College Donate Construction Funds</h3>
<p>Since the National Shanghai Medical College was reorganized in 1932, under the careful planning and hard work of President Yan, the teaching, research, and material construction have made great progress. Recently, the college has resolved the issue of its site and is about to raise funds to build formal college buildings. Xiao Shuji, a former first-year student of the college, wrote to President Yan, expressing his willingness to donate a portion of the education funds left by his father to the construction of the college buildings, and to continue to save and donate gradually in the future, in order to arouse the interest of other students in donating and promote the completion of the college buildings. His sincerity in loving the school and studying hard is truly commendable among today's students.</p>
<h3>Chen Xuanshan Donates Books to Guangxia Middle School</h3>
<p>Dr. Chen Xuanshan, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently visited Guangxia Middle School on Xinzha Road in this city and praised the school's excellent management. He particularly commended the school's library for its comprehensive facilities and rich content. He also learned that the school has allocated a large sum of money this semester to expand the library for the third time. He wrote to Wang Yukai, Director of Academic Affairs of the school, yesterday, donating more than 300 volumes of valuable Chinese and Western books to the school's library, including many rare ancient woodblock-printed books, which are especially valuable.</p>
<h3>Zhenxing Girls' Middle School Reforms</h3>
<p>Since Principal Huang Daping founded Zhenxing Girls' Middle School on Seymour Road, she has been working hard and expanding the facilities as much as possible. During the winter vacation, in order to assess students' progress, she sent letters to students' parents to conduct detailed discussions on the identification of students' academic and mental well-being. The school will start the next semester on February 5th, and has recently hired many talented and knowledgeable professors. The number of new applicants is also exceptionally high.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Applicants for Cihang Midwifery School</h3>
<p>Cihang Midwifery School, located at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Wuding Road in this city, with Principal Song Jian and Director of Training Wang Xuequan, has been sparing no effort in improving school affairs for several years. The school has already jointly applied to the Ministry of Education for registration with the City Education Bureau and the Health Bureau. Starting next semester, it will hire more famous professors and add new school buildings in order to fully develop. Recently, the number of people going to the school to register and apply for the examination has been exceptionally high. During the first examination the day before yesterday, dozens of students took the exam, and most of them passed. Only a few who performed slightly worse can participate in the second examination on the 5th of last month. In order to increase the interest of students staying at school during the winter vacation, the Director of Training, Wu Xuequan, regularly leads them to visit famous hospitals in the city to broaden their knowledge.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the China Public School Alumni Association</h3>
<p>Long Yingjie, Hu Shi, and Others Elected as Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The China Public School Alumni Association held its inaugural meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday, with more than a hundred graduating alumni attending. He Jia was elected as chairman. All the alumni believed that the alma mater has a glorious history of 30 years, is a famous school in the country, and has served the party in the past and provided funds to Dr. Sun Yat-sen for revolutionary purposes. When Dr. Sun was appointed as the Provisional President, he allocated 600,000 public bonds to supplement the funds of China Public School and served as a member of the school board, providing unwavering support. However, today the school buildings have been destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and the educational authorities have ordered the school to close within a time limit, which is very regrettable. Therefore, yesterday, a unanimous resolution was passed to request the authorities to withdraw the order and to request the school board to appoint a principal as soon as possible to be responsible for the restoration. The executive committee (Long Yingjie, Liu Liang, He Jia, Ma Ji, Bob Nie, Zhang Shiben, Zhou Xianchu, An Mengzhou, and others, a total of fifteen people) and the supervisory committee (Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jingnong, Hu Shi, and others, a total of five people) were elected. Subsequently, the elected executive committee members continued to hold the first executive committee meeting and elected Long Yingjie, Nie Haifan, and Zhou Xianchu as executive members.</p>

The interior is spacious and clean and can accommodate more than 300 people.</p>

<h3>Western Qing Basketball Finals</h3>
<p>McLarens Still Submits to Pirates, Pirates Win Fifth Consecutive Championship</p>
<p>25｜35 Pirates' Defense is Like an Impregnable Fortress</p>
<p>Smith and Carlson Give Unique Performances</p>
<p>New Yang Defeats Mingqiang in First B-League Final</p>
<p>The Pirates continue to hold their fifth consecutive Western Qing basketball championship. McLaren's final efforts last night still ended in failure. The result of the game was 36 to 25, a difference of eleven points. The referee was Hall, and the inspector was Jessup.</p>
<p>Chinese basketball in the Western Qing League has been declining, unable to compete, and as a result, there are few patrons, even to the point of being deserted. Last night's final between the Pirates and McLarens attracted many Chinese ladies to watch, scrambling to get in. Of course, there were also many Western spectators. The Western Qing basketball hall was packed, the first grand occasion since the Western Qing basketball game between Lianghua and the Pirates. The game cannot be called exceptionally good, nor can it be called bad. The Pirates' victory was the inevitable result, as they were superior to McLarens in every way. Their tight defense was like an impregnable fortress, with no gaps to be entered. The victory also lies here, and McLarens must also sigh at their accurate long shots. McLarens are ultimately not as experienced. In the B-League final, New Yang defeated Mingqiang 56 to 27.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association A-League is scheduled to begin on the 27th. In the future, the two teams will meet again twice, and we will see who is better. It is hoped that a strong and outstanding Chinese team will rise up and defeat them to regain face.</p>
<h3>Reasons for McLaren's Failure</h3>
<p>Before the game, it was said that McLaren could defeat the Pirates this year and win the championship. The result was unexpected. The first reason for the failure was, of course, that the defense was far inferior to that of the Pirates. Under the strict supervision of the opponent, they still attacked the basket, so they ran into walls everywhere. After entering, they also tried a few long shots, but they were inaccurate. Center Locke was guarded by Pirates' Center Ryan and had no chance of survival. He never hit a single shot. In terms of various techniques, they were not as experienced as the Pirates in this area.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Pirates' Performance</h3>
<p>Compared to McLaren, the Pirates' performance was much better. Most of the time, the ball was in front of McLaren's basket. Carlson was in the middle, Smith and Squier flanked on both sides, and long men and Pyley were behind. This method was repeatedly effective. Carlson's backhand shot in the crowd hit many times, which was wonderful to watch. Squier's ability to penetrate was even more impressive. His power was undiminished. The long man caught the falling ball under the basket without a single mistake. It is a pity that Smith's shot was greatly reduced, otherwise the Pirates would have won long ago.</p>
<h3>McLaren Follows Closely</h3>
<p>Pirates' Squier scored the first goal, opening the record with two points. Byers hit one of his penalty shots, taking the lead 3 to 2. Both sides were very cautious. The Pirates took the lead again 6 to 4. Due to many penalties, McLaren took the lead twice 8 to 7. With one hit from Carlson, the Pirates gave up on following McLaren and took the lead all the way. After 16 to 9, McLaren worked harder to chase to 16 to 15 in the first half. The Pirates were only one point ahead.</p>
<h3>The Pirates Finally Win</h3>
<p>In the second half, the two sides were deadlocked for five or six minutes, and the Pirates were only able to gain one more point, and were once able to tie at 21. After 25 to 21, McLaren chased up two points, making it 25 to 23. Unexpectedly, McLaren stopped scoring from then on, and the Pirates succeeded everywhere. After one hit and then another, McLaren's mind was in a panic, and they were busy adjusting their troops, knowing that they were no longer able to compete. At 31 to 23, Byers was penalized, and McLaren declared despair. The final score was 36 to 25.</p>

<h3>New Yang Beats Mingqiang</h3>
<p>After the game between the Pirates and McLaren ended, New Yang and Mingqiang continued to play the first B-League final. Under the crossfire, New Yang took the lead, and soon took the lead 6 to 2 and 10 to 4. Mingqiang worked hard to fight back and chased up to 10 to 10. Thanks to Ye Quanlue's several wonderful hits, they took the lead 16 to 12. New Yang continued to work hard and tied the score at 18 when the first half ended. In the second half, New Yang became more and more energetic, the connection was good, and the shots were accurate. The score soared, and Mingqiang was out of reach. At the end of the game, the score was 56 to 27. New Yang won the first game and has a good chance of winning the B-League title.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Commissioner Going to Europe to Study Education</p>
<h3>Vocational Education Report (10)</h3>
<p>National Agricultural School: This school is a practical agricultural school. Admission requires an entrance examination, and the academic program is two years (except for the National School of Arts and Crafts in Versailles, which requires three years). It focuses on training farm work and management personnel. It is also a place where national colleges study practical experience.</p>
<p>Agricultural Schools: These types of schools are mostly established by provinces or cities, and sometimes by the state. The salaries of teachers are all paid by the state. The length of the academic program, admission qualifications, and curriculum standards vary greatly. They are determined by the Ministry of Agriculture according to local conditions or based on the recommendations of the school's management committee. All of the above three types of schools collect tuition and other fees, but they also provide scholarships and free places.</p>
<p>Winter Agricultural Schools: These types of schools are established for the children of farmers who cannot afford to attend ordinary schools. They are mostly attached to agricultural schools, middle schools, higher primary schools, or other public education institutions. Students must be at least fifteen years old, be the children of farmers, and have at least two years of farming experience.</p>
<p>Agricultural Extension Classes: Extension classes must be established at the request of the municipal government or the provincial agricultural education committee. Students must be at least thirteen years old, and the academic program is four years, with 150 hours of instruction each year. The teaching period is determined based on local conditions.</p>
<p>Women's Agricultural Education</p>
<p>Women's agricultural education is handled by the following schools: (1) National School of Domestic Science, (2) Agricultural School of Domestic Science (equivalent to agricultural schools), (3) Temporary Agricultural School of Domestic Science, similar in nature to winter schools, (4) Mobile Agricultural School of Domestic Science, (5) Agricultural and Domestic Science Extension Classes. Among the various types of women's agricultural education, the mobile agricultural school of domestic science is particularly distinctive. It is organized by each province and subsidized by the state. It travels to various cities and towns, providing rotational teaching. The locality must provide housing, water, and electricity, and all teaching materials related to rural domestic affairs, such as cooking, ironing, sewing, hat making, milk work, and livestock raising, must be carried by the teachers. The curriculum emphasizes both theory and practice. Graduates must pass an examination and are given diplomas.</p>
<p>Vocational Schools: Vocational schools are roughly divided into two categories: (1) Industrial and Commercial Practical Schools (or simply Practical Schools) and (2) Craft Schools.</p>
<p>Practical Schools: Those with a primary school diploma may enter at the age of twelve. Those without a diploma must be at least thirteen years old to enter. Needy children who have excellent grades may be given scholarships by the state, provincial government, or local government. The academic program of practical schools is three years, but most schools have a preparatory class for one year to allow students to acquire introductory skills in various crafts during this preparatory period to make a decision about their lifelong employment. In the first two years of practical school, the training courses are not divided into departments. However, in the third year of the regular class, students who wish to advance to higher vocational schools or specialize in a certain industry are given separate training. The so-called industrial or commercial certificate is also awarded at the end of the third year of the regular class. In addition to basic machine repair, tool making, and metalworking, practical school subjects include various specialties. In women's practical schools, domestic science is considered particularly important. Household management is considered the most important duty of women in France. The past achievements of practical schools are well known, and factories and shops are happy to employ their graduates. Each year, industrial and commercial certificate examinations are held, and practical school graduates must compete with apprentices from factories and shops. The subjects tested are biased towards practical experience, and the examiners are all employers, foremen, and shop assistants. However, the results of the examinations show that practical school students are often among the top ranks. Practical schools are either municipal or provincial. All routine maintenance costs, such as school building equipment and installations, are provided by the province or locality, and teacher salaries, except for the salaries of factory internship trainers, which are borne half by the locality or province, are all provided by the state's political expenses.</p>
<p>When a school is founded, the government provides a subsidy of 50% for both construction and equipment costs. This is stipulated by a 1923 decree. However, if a locality has donated a school building site, it may also be considered as part of the founding costs, but in this case, the national subsidy is also limited to providing for the full construction and equipment costs.</p>
<p>Craft Schools: Practical schools that specialize in training in a certain craft or industry are called craft schools, or they are prefixed with the name of the industry, such as shoe-making craft school, garment-making craft school, masonry craft school, plumbing craft school, hotel service craft school, etc. The organization of craft schools is very similar to that of practical schools. Representatives of the industry (employers or artisans, employees) are important members of the school's "improvement committee," but they are not permanent positions, so that the members of the committee will advance with the times and seek progress for the school. Rural areas have specialized craft schools that train rural artisans and rural workers to be familiar with machinery or electrical appliances used in agriculture. Currently, there are approximately 220 practical schools and craft schools throughout France, with approximately 30,000 students.</p>
<p>Factory Apprentice Training</p>
<p>Supplementary Classes: If factories and shops do not establish special schools to teach apprentices, then the training that young workers or employees receive will necessarily be limited to practical skills and lack general knowledge education and artistic theory. This type of training cannot be considered complete apprentice training, so the establishment of supplementary classes is an important driving force for vocational education.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On "Silence"</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Spontaneous silence, both in China and abroad, is regarded as a virtue in life. The Chinese say: "Calamity comes from the mouth!" So the wise keep their mouths shut. The British Carlyle said: "Silence and mystery! If this era were still an era of building altars, then the altars should be dedicated to them." He also quoted a Swiss proverb, "Speech is silver, silence is gold," and modified it to say: "Speech is temporary, silence is permanent." The Belgian symbolist Maeterlinck, in his essay collection "The Treasure of the Humble," praises silence to the highest degree.</p>
<p>He even says that the communication of souls through language is far less thorough than through silence. Especially when two people are in love, what determines this love is the first silence between them. When returning home from afar, when separation is imminent, when great joy is about to happen, when life ends, or when great misfortune is about to come, silence always precedes us. Therefore, what people fear most when there are many people is a deathly silence. The seriousness of silence is the seriousness of love, death, and fate.</p>
<p>Maeterlinck's praise of silence naturally has its own insights; but non-spontaneous silence is a bit uncomfortable. Let me tell you a story: Ji Xiaolan, the god of fire, was very fond of tobacco. One day, while he was puffing smoke and revising the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, he suddenly heard a report: "The Emperor is here!" He stuffed his pipe into his boot and hurried down to greet the Emperor. Later, the fire burned his socks and flesh, and the smell of burning was coming out. The Emperor asked: "What's burning?" He just pretended to smile wryly and calmly replied: "Nothing!" This kind of silence really echoes the French saying that speech is the art of concealing thought. But although the art was successful, the flesh inevitably suffered pain.</p>
<h3>Talking About Faces</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>A story circulating among the people of Shaoxing says that Bao Longtu and Di Qing swapped heads. Originally, Bao Gong was the literary star in the sky, and Di Qing was the military star. They descended to earth at the same time to support the Song Dynasty. Bao Gong was to be a civil official and should have had a fair face, while Di Qing was dark-headed, just like a military general. But when Bao Gong descended to earth, he mistakenly took Di Qing's head in haste, so Di Qing had to make do with wearing Bao Gong's head to descend to earth. Therefore, when Di Qing went to battle, he had to let his hair down and wear a copper mask to cover his fair face to make his appearance seem more awe-inspiring. And Bao Gong is still called "Bao Heitou" (Black Head).</p>
<p>It is hard to say who benefited from this transaction. If it was for building up strength, then Bao Gong would regret it, but in terms of career, a fair face was not only not good for Di Qing, but also reduced his prestige, so it can be seen that Di Qing was at a disadvantage. Bao Gong was different. He seems to have earned the reputation of "Yanluo" (King of Hell) largely due to his black head. Even his smile earned the beautiful name of "Yellow River Clearing," which shows that an ugly face was actually very valuable to him. It seems appropriate for someone who is a "law-enforcing and impartial" hard-nosed official to have such a face. In this case, Bao Gong benefited. Just from the point of view of not having to wear a mask, he was much more comfortable than Di Qing. So I suspect that Bao Gong's taking the wrong head may have been intentional.</p>
<p>Since the invention of firearms, the way of fighting has changed greatly. Today's military generals mostly stay in the rear and do not need to show their faces to intimidate the enemy. So it does not matter if they have a fair face, and there is no need to wear a copper mask. And having a fair face is very helpful in winning the hearts of women.</p>
<h3>Memories in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>When I was sick, I thought about going somewhere to have fun, but after thinking about it, there was no place to have fun. Like the grass in the park, I could sit on it, and the shady paths, I could walk on them. However, not having the money to buy a ticket to enter was a minor matter; if I didn't wear a gentleman's suit and put on a gentleman's face, going in would only increase my illness.</p>
<p>So, I had to sit in the room and meditate, replaying the most glorious scenes in my past life, one by one. Because, I felt, this should also be a plaything to make myself happy, right?</p>
<p>So, I walked into the park. Ah, a sea of plum blossoms, spreading fragrance. The winter sun, warmly smiling on the branches. Dewdrops and flower shadows, along the path, dripping on my clothes. Happiness flew out of my body. I forgot that I was still in this cursed Shanghai, and my body and mind had flown to my second hometown, Yunnan, which was far away in the clouds.</p>
<p>At that time, I was working as a handyman in the Kunming Red Cross Society, being scolded and bossed around all day long... I couldn't breathe freely under those heavy pressures.</p>
<p>Was it because I was sick that I got a vacation? Or was it due to something else? Anyway, I got a day off. Early in the morning, I sneaked to the park outside the South Gate, and while walking enthusiastically in the warm morning sun and among the sparse shadows of the plum blossoms, I looked at the vast and beautiful blue sky in the distance and whispered repeatedly:</p>
<p>"I am free! I am free!"</p>
<p>Happiness and joy, like invisible soap bubbles, evaporated from the cells of my whole body, flying one by one to the branches, to the grass, and up to the blue sky.</p>
<p>But, soon, acquaintances came, my masters came – they were either members of the Red Cross Society or directors, in short, all the richest people in the city.</p>
<p>Although they didn't say, "You, a handyman, are here too? Get out of here," I immediately felt uneasy and agitated, and even my breathing became hurried.</p>
<p>So, I lowered my head and fled the park.</p>
<p>All the way, I thought sadly: "Without equality in life, there is no freedom."</p>
<p>Haven't the black slaves in America been liberated for many years? But why are they still crying out to this day? I understood.</p>
<p>Recalling this, the glorious film shattered and disappeared.</p>
<p>There were no plum blossoms, no morning sun, all of life was dim, both past and present.</p>
<p>Go to bed and sleep! In this sick Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Graduation Thesis</h3>
<p>— Ye Chai</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"How much?"</p>
<p>"Five dollars."</p>
<p>I shook my head:</p>
<p>"I won't do a graduation thesis for five dollars."</p>
<p>"Just so-so, Old Li – just randomly put something together, as long as it's an essay."</p>
<p>Old Hu frowned, looking very embarrassed. I perked up a little:</p>
<p>"Then, how many words do I need to write?"</p>
<p>"It has to be five or six thousand words, right?"</p>
<p>"Five or six thousand words?"</p>
<p>I glared at Old Hu. I shouted angrily in my heart:</p>
<p>"What? You want me to write six thousand words for five dollars! Is my writing not even worth one dollar per thousand words? Outrageous! I won't do it..."</p>
<p>"Help me out, Old Li! You're free anyway."</p>
<p>I, I, really can't do it…"</p>
<p>Old Hu looked like he was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Stupid thing! Who told you to come to me! You're not even a graduate?"</p>
<p>"I have no choice. This, is, is…"</p>
<p>"Whose is it?"</p>
<p>"Is, is…"</p>
<p>Old Hu hesitated embarrassedly. Then: "It's Miss Wang's!"</p>
<p>"Haha! You rascal! So you have a crush on Miss Wang! Fine, I'll help you out! Come and get it at lunchtime tomorrow. But, you have to give me the money first – my goods are cash only, no credit."</p>
<p>Old Hu happily left, and I borrowed three or four books on art overnight, copying a paragraph here, piecing together a few sentences there, until dawn, when I finally finished this great graduation thesis.</p>
<p>At noon, Old Hu ran over and took the essay without even looking at it. So I bought some wine and dishes and had a big feast in my garret.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>I was dreaming when someone ran into my garret.</p>
<p>"Why are you sleeping so early?"</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Wang…"</p>
<p>I scrambled to my feet in a panic, feeling like I had been caught stealing: "Maybe my thesis is no good, and she's here to ask for a refund." I quickly greeted her with a smile:</p>
<p>"Please sit down! Long time no see!…"</p>
<p>I pretended to be very calm.</p>
<p>"Yes! I've been really busy. I, cough! Cough! … Here!…"</p>
<p>She took out a stack of manuscript paper from her bosom and placed it on the table. Then:</p>
<p>"It's all because of this graduation thesis! I've been working myself to death, looking for reference books for over a week to finish it. Now, please give me…"</p>
<p>"Ah!…"</p>
<p>I almost laughed my teeth off. Then, I said respectfully:</p>
<p>"I dare not! I dare not! It must be very good."</p>
<p>"Please correct it, please correct it!…"</p>
<p>So I opened the package of paper:</p>
<p>My scribbled mess had been copied over by her. At the beginning: Not bad. Looking down: Not bad. Two words were missing: It doesn't matter. A sentence was changed: Hmm! Changed for the worse… So-so. Another sentence was changed: Hmm! … I had to keep looking with a heavy heart, finally… Heavens! I couldn't bear it any longer:</p>
<p>"Miss Wang! Good! Good! But, I feel…" I stammered:</p>
<p>"I feel, this, this place… it seems…"</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes! This place…"</p>
<p>"It doesn't quite fit, does it?…"</p>
<p>"Oh! So! Oh! … Then, please…" I quickly grabbed a pen and scribbled all over it, replacing it with my original text. She stood beside me, looking very embarrassed: "Thank you! I was simply confused by the reference books!"</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In the 21st's "Free Talk" article, in the third paragraph of "Critic of Critics", the last line, "He has no fixed circle" should be "He must have a fixed circle". Please correct it. Thank you. Ni Shuoer.</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter (5)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>"You didn't think about your daughter!"</p>
<p>Her eyes stared at the empty wall, her tone like that of an old woman who had completely despaired of the world.</p>
<p>He still didn't speak, sometimes raising his palms to his eyes, as if looking at the patterns on them; but his eyes were filled with tears, and he couldn't see anything clearly. He only knew that the person sitting by the bed was his daughter, the daughter who had sacrificed her life for him, she had cried, had cried sadly for him. He knew he loved her, she was such a lovable child. He also knew that he still loved her now, but he had made her cry. He understood the reason, had nothing to say, he wanted his daughter to blame him, even to scold him, he could bear it. He saw the wine bottles lying on the ground, his regret overwhelmed him like the entire sky pressing on his heart. He wanted to stand up and smash them with his feet; but he thought that it would be useless, so he restrained himself again. His mouth was dry, needing some water to moisten it, he knew he didn't have the strength to stand up, nor could he ask his daughter, although he knew she wouldn't refuse him. He endured it, and when he couldn't bear it any longer, his mouth made a sound, his tongue licking his upper palate. She saw it, stood up, took a teacup from the cupboard, and poured a full cup from the thermos. She walked over and offered it to his hands; but seeing his trembling hands, she didn't hand it over, but sat on the ground next to the chair and brought the teacup to his mouth. He looked at her face, the face that still had traces of tears, and lowered his head to drink the water. He drank the entire cup in one breath. She asked softly:</p>
<p>"Do you want more?"</p>
<p>He tilted his head slightly and shook it, but two large teardrops were embedded in the corners of his eyes again. She didn't bother to put down the teacup in her hand, but leaned over him and began to cry. Her tears soaked through his clothes, warmly as if warming his heart, and he stroked her body with his hands.</p>
<p>"Child… you are right to complain about me…"</p>
<p>He used a lot of strength to say this sentence, he had many more words to say; but it was as if something had choked his throat, and he couldn't say anything more. He could only let his tears wash his face like water.</p>
<p>"You don't know these days…" he forced himself to continue, "these days my heart is so painful… that dark shadow is cast upon me… only making me sad. Last night… there was such a good moon… child, you don't know…"</p>
<p>He paused, wiping the tears from his face with his hand.</p>
<p>"Your mother and I confessed our love to each other under such a good moonlight… the moonlight was so good… when I kissed her forehead… I could see… I could see her hair, strand by strand. Last night's moon was naturally not as good as that… but I thought… this moonlight is also shining on her… so I became happy. Do you understand, my happiness brought even greater melancholy… I don't know where she is… I don't know if she is also thinking of me?"</p>
<p>He paused again, she knew the reason for this pause, but she still asked: "Dad, would you like some more water?"</p>
<p>He nodded, but when she brought him a cup of water, he only drank one sip and asked her to put it aside. She gently rubbed her eyes, still sitting beside him. He continued to say: "I know she won't be thinking of me… if she thought of me, she could come to me… but I am stupid, many people say that about me… you may also say that about me… but I can't forget her. Last night I was thinking of her even more deeply… I almost couldn't live without seeing her face immediately. I had no choice, child… so I quietly took out the wine you had sealed for me." His voice became dry. "I didn't forget you… I remembered that I had promised you never to let wine touch my lips again… but the thought of her tormented me so much… that I had to immerse myself in wine to forget her… that's how it was, I wanted to forget her. But, after one bottle was already drunk, her shadow flashed more clearly in my mind… so, I opened another bottle. This made me drunk, so drunk that I didn't know anything… I forgot her, I forgot everything. I slept on the ground like a shameless drunkard… this ugly appearance made my beloved daughter cry for me, I am just a fool… I am not worthy to be your father!"</p>
<p>In the end, he cried out loud, and slumped down again. He hid his face in his hands as if feeling ashamed, but his daughter comforted him with a gentle voice: "Don't be sad, Dad, I'm just worried about your health. I know you love me, I don't want you to continue like this…"</p>

<h3>Significant Rise in Gold Standard Prices</h3>
<p>Sharp Increase of Six Yuan and Seventy Cents Due to Covering Short Positions</p>
<p>Since the gold market stabilized recently, the underlying trend has been bullish. Yesterday, the market suddenly strengthened, and the upward momentum was quite strong. In the morning, the overseas silver market saw no change in both the U.S. and the U.K. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange rose by 1.4 and 3.1 fen, respectively. Exchange rate fluctuations were small. The London gold price rose by two pence, stocks fell by 4.3 jiao, U.S. wheat fell by 0.875, U.S. cotton fell by 9 pounds, and the opening price of the wool market retreated to 88-89 yuan, indicating a weak trend. Reuters reported that U.S. Senator Teller advocated proposing a currency amendment to restore silver coinage. However, Teller and King's meeting with the President yielded little result. Therefore, the market opened weakly but remained flat, with continued narrow fluctuations. Later, Sassoon &amp; Co. came in to buy shillings and U.S. dollars. Despite the news of the U.S. Senate passing a rural public debt of $2,000,000,000, the gold market was very bullish, breaking through the 90 yuan mark. The market opened steadily afterward, indicating that major players had already covered their short positions, and market confidence strengthened. Subsequently, Chinese merchants covered their short positions, and the Central Exchange Bureau continued to buy aggressively, tightening the foreign exchange market. HSBC's exchange rate quotation was further reduced, and the gold price rapidly rebounded. The highest price reached 1,090 yuan. Below is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>

However, because Pangen accepted May U.S. dollars at 0.875, HSBC's quotation revealed a flat British currency and an increase of 0.125 for U.S. currency, the situation was still stable. Zhengjin ate June U.S. dollars at 35.0625 yuan. Shunli, Fuyu, Zhaofeng, and Changjin reached 8.5 yuan. Hengxing continued to supply, once falling, but because Ruikang limited purchases, the gold market continued to stabilize.

Furthermore, Sassoon bought February U.S. dollars at 0.1875 and shillings, retail investors actively lifted the price, and Hengyu, Zhaofeng, and Chang also purchased, rising to 90.04 yuan.

HSBC came out at February 34 yuan, Dadecheng and Dafa sold at 5.3 yuan, Dachangxiang and Bingxing continued to advance and remain strong, anticipating that HSBC's quotation would be reduced, with the pound falling by 0.125 and the U.S. dollar falling by 0.375.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Clearing House is Calm</h3>
<p>Financial circles have been occupied with consolidation in recent days. New clearing has been very sparse. Although the closing procedures are extensive, they have no impact on the market sentiment. The foreign exchange market yesterday saw little change.

<h3>Jiangnan Silver Suddenly Rises by Ten Yuan in the Afternoon</h3>

The price of Guangdong small silver dollars showed minimal fluctuations, with 792 yuan in the morning market and 792.4 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>Stock and Salt Tax Possibly Breaking Through 50 Yuan</p>
<p>Mostly Swap Transactions</p>
<p>No Significant Conflict Between Bulls and Bears</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although there are only a few days left in the trading month, the attitude of both sides remains very calm, with no signs of mutual conflict. The result of the frantic selling of Number 46 in recent days is indeed unfavorable for many bulls, but the market does not show any signs of shaking, indicating the strength of the bulls. Although the salt tax has repeatedly advanced and retreated around the 50-yuan mark, it still closed at 49.95 yuan yesterday, which also shows the toughness of the bulls. With such high barriers and only two days left, any slight crack on either side could trigger fluctuations. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, new transactions are gradually decreasing, which is also related to the rise and fall of the bond market. The opening in the morning was still mostly swap transactions, with very few entries and exits by major players. Due to the divided swap relationship, the forward price rose sharply by 0.7 jiao, and the rest also rose by 0.3-0.4 jiao, but the salt tax conversely decreased slightly by 0.1-0.2 jiao. This is because the number of shorts within Number 46 has decreased due to the previous frantic selling, so there is this phenomenon of different trends. Market confidence has not yet been able to rally as a result. Most of the second round of trading fell slightly by 0.1-0.2 jiao, while the salt tax rose again by about 0.2 jiao, and the trend saw balance. Both sides had swap transactions in the two rounds in the afternoon, but it was not very rushed. Comparatively, there were more swap transactions from the short side. The market price was slightly better by about 0.1-0.2 jiao per round. The salt tax reached 50 yuan twice but failed to break through the barrier. But the closing price only fell by 0.05 yuan, and the trend still has the possibility of breaking through 50 yuan. As a result, the market price unanimously rose from 0.2-0.3 jiao to 0.65 jiao. The total number of transactions was 12,300,500 yuan. There were still no spot trades. The total futures salt tax was 4,005,000 yuan, divided troop was 1,925,000 yuan, 19 customs duties was 1,065,000 yuan, 20 rolls of 20 customs duties was 2,365,000 yuan, and the gold short whole 6 was 2,220,000 yuan. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>Bulls Emerge on the New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on the 22nd saw bulls continue to emerge, resulting in a fall of a few jiao to two yuan. There was a general sense of optimism regarding oil sales contracts, so the situation at the end of the market was still strong. The reason why speculators are eager to close out positions is that Professor Warren declared in Washington that he believed the United States would not enter into unlimited inflation, and at the same time, he feared that the Department of Commerce might suggest limiting short selling and guaranteed transactions tomorrow. Bonds rose slightly, and the total daily transaction volume was 2.66 million shares. "Wheat" fell slightly due to a lack of new buyers. The southwest is still in drought, indicating a reduction in supply of 4 million bushels, which benefits buyers. The "Cotton" market situation fell slightly due to doubts about the unified ginning legislation. The Q&amp;A for farmers seemed to be delayed. According to rumors, the cotton loan to China has been greatly reduced, and market confidence is somewhat chaotic. Today, some of it belongs to the government throwing it out, and the bulls seem to continue to be cautious. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Aftermath Society was 34.45 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 105.09 Down 0.43</p>
<p>Twenty Railway Stocks 47.54 Down 0.48</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 26.85 Down 0.10</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 88.82 Up 0.09</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities 51.97 Down 0.36</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Raw Yarn Lacks Excitement</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has no excitement to speak of, with minimal fluctuations and an unusually bleak situation. Due to the deterioration of various environments and the decline of commerce, yarn sales are becoming increasingly difficult to improve. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, there are signs of closure, so there is no change in the market.</p>
<h3>Human Indicators are Idle</h3>
<p>The human indicator market opened with an extremely bleak atmosphere, falling by 0.1-0.2 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was a lack of live yarn business, and it fell by another 0.1 jiao, but April rose by 0.2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,600 bales. It was found that Tongfu sold 400 bales, Yuanda sold 650 bales, Renfeng sold 350 bales, Yuanda sold 600 bales, and Gengfeng bought 950 bales, Jifeng bought 300 bales, Shenchang bought 350 bales, Yuande bought 400 bales, and Yukang bought 250 bales.

<p>Human Index Closing Increase/Decrease Remaining Account Balance March 1741 Down 136,500</p>
<p>January 1705 Down 1 13,000 April 1760 41,400</p>
<p>February 1725 1 25,250 Total 116,150</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Even Slower</h3>

<h3>Raw Cotton Market State Still Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, but the situation is still strong. Because buyers are optimistic, the source has been sparse recently due to the impact of freezing weather. So the market situation is better, but the overseas cotton market is trending downstream, and there are still news of continuing to fall in Indian cotton. And the current cotton demand is depressed, and the factory's yarn has no way out. The appetite for raw materials is particularly slow. In general, it does not escape the whirlpool situation.</p>
<h3>Zheng Index Without Much Change</h3>
<p>The Zheng index opened flat in the early market, and the popularity was weak because the external cotton fell. Each month fell by 0.1 jiao, but this month rose by 0.05. In the afternoon, there was more dispersed short covering, and each month rose by 0.05. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,100 dan. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,500 dan, Chunji sold 1,100 dan, Yuanda sold 1,500 dan, Shenji sold 1,000 dan, Yukang sold 1,700 dan, and Yuanxingchang sold 2,800 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Falls as Bulls Close Out Positions</h3>

As a result, spot goods fell by 10 pounds, and futures fell by 9 to 16 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot goods fell by 7 points, and futures fell by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to European exporters selling.

<h3>Grain: Marked Flour Lingers and Watches</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month roughly presented a hovering phenomenon. With foreign wheat quotes, Chicago went back a little, 0.2 jiao, and Canada went down a little, 0.1 jiao, so after opening the price, market confidence was already flat and soft. Also, a small factory took away most of the bulls this month, because the footstep of the settlement day was near, and they continued to return. The market atmosphere was of course difficult to remove. The distant period was also soft because the customer gangs had very little business. The transaction was even clearer in each dish in the afternoon, the number of bulls returning was also reduced, and the market presented a settled situation. The prospects are very few eager to make progress, because of the present decline in actual sales, and the inactivity of off-industry speculation. As a result, this month was a little 0.5 li less than the previous day, February and March were a little 0.25 li less, April was still, May was 0.75 li less, and June was still, it is said.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Weak and Unbearable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month presented a phenomenon of first stable then falling. Foreign wheat prices continued to fall by about 0.1 or 0.2 jiao. At the beginning, market confidence was already stable, but later because there was a return of bulls, the trend gradually became unfavorable. When opening prices in the afternoon, the price of the current month was close because the settlement was near. Combined with the rumor that a certain food shop in the south city had been stranded, the exchange chips were all returned. Therefore, the market atmosphere was so weak and unbearable. Fortunately, transactions were not active, and a sharp fall was not easy. As a result, this month fell by 0.6 fen compared to the previous day, March fell by 0.4 fen, April fell by 0.3 fen, and there were no comparisons in the rest.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Falls by 0.05 Yuan</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, each gang’s source was more than forty, (more than six thousand packages) The market situation was normal at first, but after a light flurry of snowflakes, confidence slightly turned upward. But shop stomach was still barely up to it, so the thick japonica of each gang was still stable, and du jian was also without ups and downs, only the foreign pointed goods lacked relatively firm goods. The guest gang purchase appetite for the late rice of each gang, though the north and south foreign gangs continued to handle 1,5-600 packages, but the price was back to a drop of 0.3-0.5 fen due to the vastly different attitude of the client family, and it seemed the trends had a vacillating change. The going path of the yin yuan alcohol household gangs was still slow, and the market color continued weak. Wuse, bian yuan was in a league of its own, tightly and unusually.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Goods arriving in areas numbered 18 or 19 because inland rivers were frozen and not fluent, so the amount arriving was sparse. The sale path for each product was still good. Bag taste was unmoved. Close to each jiao was added to the prices for white japonica and yangxian, the amount from the going stomach for bai yuan was plentiful, high goods added jiao, middle pass added two jiao, and second rate goods were stable, bu du jian · early thin rice · yin yuan · and the guest tips were tight trend.</p>
<h3>Guest Xian Min Sales Recover</h3>
<p>Hunan and Jiangxi goods arrive continuously</p>
<p>Yesterday, the head amount of guest xian was slightly available, because the people’s confidence desired better after the end of the Min changes. Peddlers had already begun to do transport business, though everyone was in the midst of seeking convergence on all sides as the end of the year was in sight. The rice prices of Hunan and Jiangxi also were low, and the activity of peddlers caused small slips to have arrived in Shen daily from Hunan and Jiangxi. The market face was lively. There still remained a certain amount of goods en route available to reach the port within those days, but the owners of the goods were quite greedy in Fujian, and after those from the Fujian province gangs, the Quanzhou, Xinghua, and Xiamen gangs would all continue to inquire of rates. They were therefore very firm in their thoughts, the market price had a good increase, and later markets were yet in hopes of high positions. Yesterday, the Min province handled a very strong quantity, both ji yuan and guest xian had an approximate increase of one jiao. While this block and the Zhejiang gangs had stomachs, they did not dare to be glib about things due to the pricing of the Min gangs, only handling 200 or so odd bags each of Hunan Engine Oil Rice, Min gangs were also buying 200 or so bags, at 6 yuan 9 jiao to 6 yuan 7.5 jiao, also 454 bags of red coarsely hulled, at 5 yuan 8 jiao, 200 bags of roughly hulled Jing, at 5 yuan 7 jiao, 300 bags of Wuxi ji yuan rice, at 8 yuan 3 jiao, 298 bags of Wuhu ji yuan rice, at 7 yuan 5.5 jiao to 7 yuan 4.8 fen.</p>
<h3>Peanuts See Only Smooth Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday the miscellaneous grains market was deserted in transaction. It was very due to the connection to the mainland being uncut due to the cold weather and frozen ground. Both export and street listing inquired, there was no great difference in street prices. Peanuts were sold on arrival, and the selling price compared to living kernels was an increase of a yuan or more. The going of mung beans was seeing fewer sales due to seasonal relationships. The market was a quiet state with a Xiamen gang inquiring on a hundred or so odd bags yesterday. High goods of soybeans were relatively soft to middle and second-rate goods. It was also what was not to be avoided by the brewing industry.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Rise in Prices of Raw Sugar, White Lotus, and Red Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight increase in customs gold and continued tightness in the trend. The association quoted 24 yuan and 40 cents for ordinary raw sugar and white sugar, and 6 yuan and 55 cents for re-exported goods, both up by a dime. Red lotus sugar also saw an increase, with high-grade sugar quoted at 16 yuan and ordinary sugar at 15 yuan and 80 cents, with dozens of bags traded, both up by two dimes. Downstream bids were at 15 yuan and 55 and a half cents. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was quoted at 19 yuan and 90 cents, and DY mark at 19 yuan and 35 and a half cents, slightly higher than before. Zhenyu No. 1 white sugar was bid up by two dimes to 18 yuan and 80 cents, but no transactions were made. Zhu Qing offered over a hundred bags of ordinary goods, priced at 10 yuan and 8 cents, and high-grade goods at 11 yuan and 45 and a half cents. The Chao Qing market turned sluggish, with no further offers.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Difficulty in Turning Around Overseas Silk Sales</h3>
<p>Last Year's Surge in Russian Silk Exports to the US: In recent years, the Soviet Union has actively developed its sericulture industry, sending personnel to silk-producing countries such as Japan and Italy to purchase silkworm eggs and mulberry saplings, and rewarding farmers for raising silkworms and planting mulberry trees. Both silkworm egg production and silk production have increased year by year. The silk produced is mainly sold in the United States. Last year saw a surge in Russian silk exports to the US. According to a telegram received by American silk merchants in this port from the New York Silk Association, the total amount of Russian silk exported to the US last year reached 5,797 bales (based on Kilo Chehe).</p>
<p>Factory-Woven Silk Sales are Not Lively: In the overseas raw silk market, due to reduced production by factories and other facilities, the consumption of raw silk has not increased. Furthermore, the old prices of Japanese silk remain stable, and sales of Chinese silk factory products remain sluggish, with telegrams indicating a downturn. European merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Only the inland silk market is still active, and although market prices have risen by more than twenty yuan, factories still have to incur losses. Yesterday, another 50 bales of yellow and white factory-woven silk were traded, and 20 bales of French grey silk were imported, with prices remaining firm.</p>

<p>Random Remarks</p>
<h3>The Temporality of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>Every day, I come out from my small apartment and go to the school to teach. I pass through a very bustling place, and in the middle of this place, there is an extremely large wall. This wall is the most suitable place for shop advertisements.</p>
<p>The first advertisement I discovered on this wall was for Ma Zhanshan cigarettes. At that time, the painting on the wall was of a national hero, riding a horse and waving a flag, with imposing demeanor. This was during the period of national salvation and resistance against Japan, fully expressing the spirit of a national hero. Before long, the advertisement disappeared.</p>
<p>What I continued to discover in this place was an advertisement for Butterfly brand cigarettes. The painting on the wall was of a graceful woman, charming and elegant, making one feel like ascending to immortality, with one's soul flying away for half a day. This clearly indicated that the work of national salvation was already completed, and this was the period of entertainment. Before long, the advertisement disappeared again.</p>
<p>What arose in response to the times was the Meng Jiangnv cigarette advertisement. Meng Jiangnv traveled thousands of miles in search of her husband. Isn't she the most pitiful and sympathetic woman in history? This clearly expresses the meaning of sorrow arising from extreme joy. When I thought of this, I thought everyone should wake up, but by this time, it was too late to wake up.</p>
<p>I see that these three advertisements have a definite continuity and are very sufficient to represent the attitudes of our people in three periods.</p>
<p>Ah! Meng Jiangnv, when will you finally find your husband?</p>
<h3>Women's Year of National Products: Introspection</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (January 21st), I unfolded a copy of the "Old Newspaper That's Not Old" Shen Bao, and I was shocked to see on it the heartbreaking statistic: "Last year's foreign trade deficit exceeded 410 million yuan." I think that creating such a huge trade deficit for foreign merchants in trade with China must be attributed to the enthusiasm of the compatriots who love to use foreign goods, especially the enthusiastic and tireless promotion by the sisters in the women's circle!</p>
<p>But in the past year, which was called the "Year of National Products," the amount of the trade deficit has been so huge. Isn't this too much of a joke! How can we Chinese people, who usually sing the praises of "promoting national products" so loudly, explain ourselves?</p>
<p>While I was looking at this newspaper and filled with emotion, our little statistician, Xuemei, came. She had compiled statistics on the new films shown in Shanghai's theaters last year, totaling 427, of which foreign films accounted for 355 and domestic films only 73. We call her "Little Statistician" because she likes to make these kinds of statistical tables. I pointed to this record of the trade deficit and sighed to her: "Please, you statistician, go and calculate how much of this trade deficit of 411,784,900 yuan comes from the outflow of money from our hands?"</p>
<p>She replied with a bitter smile, "Naturally, the majority is spent by our female compatriots, and the most enthusiastic promoters of this huge leakage are the modern women. In addition to the clothes on their bodies, the precious jewelry and diamond rings on their hands, etc., the cost of cosmetics such as silk stockings, high heels, and perfumes is also quite considerable. Didn't Miss Huang tell you? She spends more than 80 yuan a year buying Paris lipsticks for a little bit of cherry lips!"</p>
<p>After hearing her words, I couldn't help but nod my head in agreement, saying, "That's right, not only those extravagant and luxurious wives and young ladies often flaunt the use of expensive foreign goods, but even we cannot avoid spending white and shiny silver to buy foreign goods. Look at the fountain pens and inkwells in front of us, they are genuine imported goods! Alas! 'What's past cannot be corrected, but what's to come can still be pursued.' Since this year is the Women's Year of National Products, we must introspect ourselves more carefully in the future, and even for a single needle or thread, we must purchase national products..."</p>
<p>Before I finished speaking, she immediately stood up, expressing her determination, "Good! Let's resolve to do that. Even if we cannot suddenly turn such a huge trade deficit into a trade surplus, in any case, if we buy one less yuan of foreign goods, we can promote one more yuan of national products, and we can also reduce the trade deficit by one yuan and recover one yuan of rights and interests..."</p>
<p>Hearing her enthusiastic words, I couldn't help but clap my hands and shout "Good!", and I also learned a slogan and shouted loudly: "Female compatriots across the country, let us unite and work hard to promote national products and use national products as much as possible in this 'Women's Year of National Products'!"</p>
<h3>Each Has Their Own World</h3>
<p>— Lao Pai</p>
<p>It was one o'clock in the afternoon, and I struggled to drag my dizzy and heavy body out of bed.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, I walked out of the alley.</p>
<p>The wind was howling so fiercely that any water droplets on the ground had frozen into ice. Although the number of people coming and going was as large as usual, they were not as busy as weaving shuttles. It could be said that everyone was carrying their heads between their shoulders like filial sons at a funeral, just moving slowly.</p>
<p>The wind was howling so fiercely that everyone was afraid of the cold.</p>
<p>But here, there were:</p>
<p>Four dirty little girls. If they were a little taller, they would be old enough to start their careers of selling smiles and flesh in the "street corner" "warehouses" of the Fourth Avenue business district. Looking at them carefully, their faces were indeed fair. What they lacked was a body of clothes to protect themselves. But they were not completely naked either. Some were draped in burlap sacks, some seemed to be wearing men's broken jackets, and some were wearing things that made it impossible to discern what they were. …</p>
<p>All four were shivering.</p>
<p>Yet, all four were rejoicing.</p>
<p>After a while of "gossiping," they all kicked shuttlecocks together.</p>
<p>After a change of pace, they took turns jumping rope.</p>
<p>Smiles filled each of their dirty faces, showing their joy for life, their satisfaction with the reality of life, without disgust or evil thoughts.</p>
<p>But I think their lives are precarious enough, and in reality, they are not allowed to be so joyful.</p>
<p>Because of this, for a while, I couldn't find an answer.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was having dinner that evening, when Peng suggested going to a restaurant, but I only wanted to spend two dimes to buy some beef to cook myself, that the question stuck in my mind was dissected in an instant.</p>
<p>It turned out that I was the same as those four dirty little girls—I always expressed joy for life, satisfaction with the reality of life, without disgust or evil thoughts.</p>
<p>I had never thought about "becoming an official," and I had never thought about "getting rich," so I was very ignorant of how many "official positions" there were in the small city of Shanghai, and I didn't know what issue the aviation lottery tickets had been issued to. I only knew to work on time every day, eat, laugh, … smoke cigarettes and other things. Although sometimes I also wanted to find something suitable to do, I wasn't in a hurry to pursue it, thinking that I could get by as long as I could make a living, so why be so busy and so serious?</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many people like this. Among the 400 million compatriots, there are not only the four dirty little girls and me.</p>
<p>Our ancient sages' maxims say, "Be content and guard your position," "Be content with fate and enjoy life," "Wealth and honor are determined by fate." In short, it is "fatalism." All things, the arrangement of life, the success or failure of the future, are all left to the word "fate." There is no need to think too much or work hard.</p>
<p>In this way, of course, everyone is very well-behaved. Someone tells you to sit down, and you sit down, saying that sitting down is good. Someone tells you to stand up, and you stand up, saying that standing up is even better.</p>
<p>As for whether the "nation" and "society" have therefore become old and unprogressive, that is somewhat obscure to say and can only be left unspecified.</p>
<h3>Talking About A Destiny of Tears and Laughter</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when it was serialized daily in the Kuaihuolin section of the Xinwen Bao. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when it was applauded and cheered in the local supplement. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when Zhang Shichuan and Gu Wuwei were scheming and fighting each other. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when Wang Meiyu played two roles at the same time. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when Xue Xiaoqing and Zhu Yaoxiang were engaged in a war of words. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter when the Sanyou Bookstore offered a reward for illegal printing. I didn't read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter in... I didn't read it. So how can you talk about A Destiny of Tears and Laughter? (I also want to ask), here it comes, on New Year's Day in 1934, I returned home for two days and found this well-known novel in my cousin's bookshelf. My cousin is a current university student, and A Destiny of Tears and Laughter also occupies a place among the many books and social science books piled up. So I finished this giant work with a beautiful head drawn on the cover in two sleepless nights. However, the image it gave me was so vague that my talk about A Destiny of Tears and Laughter is nothing more than a boring thing.</p>
<p>The four ideal characters in A Destiny of Tears and Laughter｜｜Fan Jashu, Shen Fengxi, Guan Xiugu, and He Lina, are as easily deeply imprinted into the minds of grandmothers and young ladies as Tang Bohu and Qiuxiang. Having grown accustomed to old tunes such as The Story of the Three Smiles and The Pearl Pagoda, when the general petite bourgeoisie were pursuing new forms of escapism, A Destiny of Tears and Laughter was destined to be born at this time. Its overnight popularity was as unsurprising as a winter sale.</p>
<p>Fan Jashu is essentially a typical petit bourgeois. He left his hometown and came to this ancient city of Beijing, where there is no wind three feet above the ground and mud on the streets after rain, for the sake of studying. However, when I read to the last page of Candlelight in Pairs, it seemed that there was not a single line that told me that Fan Jashu was a university student seeking intellectual satisfaction, or because the image it gave me was too vague, it slipped past my eyes when I wasn't paying attention. Since A Destiny of Tears and Laughter has been published in its third edition, among the many readers at the end, there will always be—as long as they read it word for word, this question can probably be resolved.</p>
<p>Since Fan Jashu's stunning appearance at Tianqiao (a phrase stolen from The Romance of the Western Chamber｜｜self-note by Dai Ni) and his encounters with Guan Xiugu and He Lina, he has been circulating among three different types of women. I thought it would definitely be a grand comedy like Nine Beauties Reunion. However, Shen Fengxi went crazy, Guan Xiugu drifted away and disappeared, and our petit bourgeois Fan Jashu finally married Miss He, a suitable match. The author also stated at the end of the book that he could not attribute all three beauties to Fan Jashu (forgive me for not being able to quote the original sentence from the book), which seemed to be beyond my expectation. However, readers should know that Qiuxiang in The Story of the Three Smiles is essentially a young lady, and will be the adopted daughter of Hua Taishi in the future; therefore, marrying Tang Yin, a top scholar, is equivalent to the perfect match between Fan Jashu and He Lina, which is a major ending that follows the will of heaven. The daughter who sings drums and sells solutions can never turn over the palm of the Buddha. In this way, it seems that it is not beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>I don't want to say anything more about these four main characters, because I wasn't careful enough when I read the book, and I don't have a copy of A Destiny of Tears and Laughter on hand now.</p>
<p>My grandmother read Li Hanzhu's Mirror Image of People, and said that his writing was "penetrating". Now A Destiny of Tears and Laughter also suffers from this common problem. At least I think it is too idealized. Although we don't have to cite the characters in the book to our surroundings, I have heard that A Destiny of Tears and Laughter is indeed a real event, so the exaggeration of the description will naturally lose its authenticity, because I did not experience that it was a "real event" when I read A Destiny of Tears and Laughter. Although my current university student cousin said that she shed tears of sympathy, just like when she read Jade Pear Soul.</p>
<p>Referring again to Mr. Hen Shui's writing of each character's personality, they are all so strong. Now that he is writing seven or eight novels at the same time, I wonder if he still maintains his original style? I can also be sure that he is a movie fan. He is very good at using small actions, but unlike movies, he often adds unnecessary details (can these four words be used?) after the small actions to state that these are "small actions." In the entire book A Destiny of Tears and Laughter, I really want to use Cut's surgery to dig a few trenches. You see, in the end, he still uses circled lead letters to satisfy a reader's question. I think if every reader had a letter of questioning, A Destiny of Tears and Laughter could at least double in length.</p>
<p>This giant work of A Destiny of Tears and Laughter, which I finished in two sleepless nights, can no longer be "talked about," so I admit that it is nothing more than a boring thing: but I hope that there will be others who are more boring than me after reading my "Talking About A Destiny of Tears and Laughter."</p>
<p>Finally, apply the old method and drag a tail: The part about Guan Shoufeng's night visit to the general's mansion can be read as a martial arts novel.</p>

<h3>Selling One's Life</h3>
<p>— Lüdí</p>
<p>In today's society of the survival of the fittest, the cry of unemployment is as common as raising one's head to look at the sky, so it is no longer surprising. University students are spending sleepless years, and officials have to offer their daughters first. Naturally, if one is lucky enough to grab a job through auction, one must bow and scrape and shorten one's own life, or one's job is always in the dangerous time of "sand crabs"; so how can writers who rack their brains not sigh!</p>
<p>These cruel facts are being performed continuously before our eyes every day, as long as you pay a little attention to your surroundings. However, the most important condition is that your own job is also in suspense; otherwise, you are merely adding to the after-dinner conversation regarding this type of performance.</p>
<p>The performer Sun Debao acted with all her might, selling her life, these few number two characters jumped into my eyes. This at least basic performer, Sun Debao, does not have the "world fame" of Mei Lanfang. She performs in the Tianyunlou Fenghang class, just like we basic writers write articles in the butt of newspapers. She cannot make a splash on the red carpet for a month, rest for a year and a half, and then be rehired with heavy money, and "rest for a few days and choose an auspicious day to take the stage again." She "sells her life" every day, using low-level "skills" to win the applause of the audience under the stage, so she even tries Somersault kicks, holding onto that job that is always in danger of "sand crabs"; but "luck ran out for too long, and she collapsed on the ground from shortness of breath," "selling her life and returning to heaven."</p>
<p>I myself did not "cheer" at this event. I wonder what the audience, who spent two dimes to enjoy low-level interests, felt when they returned home and enjoyed a steaming hot dinner? In so-called Shanghai, it is difficult to hear one or two sighs of regret that a weak flesh was swallowed effortlessly by the strong; however, how can writers who rack their brains not sigh! Alas, Sun Debao!</p>

<h3>Learning Specialized Skills to Avoid Unemployment</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an unfortunate person who entered a store at the age of fifteen and began living as an apprentice. I have not received any new education, only reading the Analects and Mencius for six or seven years. I have been in the business world for five years now. I have been unemployed three times in these five years. Working or seeking work in old-fashioned small and medium-sized stores almost always depends on connections; whether you have the ability is secondary. Let's talk about ability. It's just writing and arithmetic. This is the most common skill. I think that among the unemployed, there must be many who have this skill. So I believe that my personal method of struggle is to desperately seek a practical specialized knowledge to overcome the harsh environment. Now it is possible to study during the day, but the following questions have arisen:</p>
<p>(1) I am now nineteen years old, so I hope to obtain a specialized knowledge within three or four years, but my level is only equivalent to junior high school in Chinese, and I have studied English arithmetic for half a year in night school and know addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I have no other knowledge. I am determined to study industry, but without a junior high school qualification, I cannot enter a higher vocational school, let alone a technical college. Sir, what method can you guide me to create a junior high school qualification in the shortest period of time and seek the knowledge I want to seek?</p>
<p>(2) Studying industry requires a longer period of study. If, due to time and economic reasons, I cannot achieve my ambition, then I think I will have to study wireless telegraphy. I heard that there is a wireless radio school established by the Ministry of Transportation in Shanghai. What is the name of the school? After graduating from the school, can the Ministry of Transportation assign me to work or intern at various radio stations? Please give me an answer.</p>
<p>(3) You may understand half of the environment I am in from this letter. If the methods I said before are not appropriate, sir, can you point out another way out for me?</p>
<p>Hu Hezhong Qi</p>
<p>Editor's note: Regarding the three points you asked, here are the answers:</p>
<p>(1) Recently, schools have paid a lot of attention to qualifications when enrolling students. You have not received school education, so it seems difficult to enter school. It is very difficult to "create a junior high school qualification in the shortest period of time" because you already have a job and cannot go back to school, and there is no preparatory school equivalent to junior high school yet.</p>
<p>(2) There is indeed a telegraph school established by the Ministry of Transportation. I heard that it is divided into wireless and wired classes. However, it is said that the entrance examination is very strict, and it is very difficult to pass the exam with your level. It is not clear whether you will be assigned a job in the future.</p>
<p>(3) You are now planning to obtain specialized knowledge to avoid unemployment. This view is not entirely correct. It must be known that unemployment in society is not caused by the unemployed lacking work skills, but is a phenomenon that is inevitably produced by the current society. You have also felt this: knowing that the unemployed are not without skills; however, you think that having specialized knowledge will make you not worry about unemployment, but that is not necessarily the case. There are still many people with specialized work skills who are unemployed, because occupations are also the same as commodities and are determined by the relationship between supply and demand; if the society is steadily improving, and production undertakings are extremely developed, and many people are needed to do things, then people with work skills can not worry about unemployment, because there are very few talents like this with work skills, and the society needs these people to do things. On the contrary, if the social production undertakings are not very developed, then even if you have the skills of a heavenly dog, you will not be able to do anything, because at this time the society does not feel a "talent shortage," but people feel a "job shortage"! Therefore, your hope to solve the employment problem by acquiring specialized knowledge is not a very reliable method, because in China today, the lack of "other material conditions for developing production" is the main reason why industry cannot develop, and the "lack of talents with production skills" is still secondary, but from an individual point of view, what other methods are there besides hoping to increase work skills, even though this is not a reliable method. According to your situation, we think that it is best not to have any great ambitions for the time being and to learn some "specialized skills." It is best to honestly put some effort into the national language and read more books on common sense of social sciences. If your writing is fluent and your common sense is rich, then it may be more convenient to seek work, because doing things in society always takes the ability to write ordinary application texts as a prerequisite. As for the common sense of social sciences, it can help you understand the current society and know your position in the current society. In this way, even if you feel the shortcomings of various environments, you can also not "blame heaven and complain about others." At the same time, it can also enable you to have a little confidence in dealing with the social environment. Therefore, we believe that learning these two subjects is beneficial to you.</p>

<h3>The Freedom of Marilyn (5)</h3>
<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>One day, it was a late autumn night, with a drizzle falling. He staggered out of a bar, completely drunk. The autumn wind on the street brought the alcohol rushing to his chest and brain, leaving him with no senses. He stumbled unconsciously down the road. A rickshaw stopped in front of the BAE entrance of a foreign bar. After a foreign sailor jumped out, he refused to pay. The rickshaw puller chased after him to demand payment. The foreign sailor kicked him, and the rickshaw puller fell to the ground. Through his drunken haze, Renjie vaguely saw this tragedy. Instinctively, he knew that the foreign sailor was bullying a poor Chinese man. His unique Northern chivalry, the inherent sense of justice, compelled him to immediately attack the foreign sailor, cursing him in English. Both were drunk, their strength amplified beyond normal. Both subconsciously understood that the foreign sailor was shouting, "You yellow-skinned Chinaman dare to fight us!" and he was shouting, "You foreign scoundrel, a butcher who won't ascend to heaven, you look down on everyone!" They cursed and grappled. Because he was wearing gentleman's clothes and speaking English, the Indian police showed him deference and didn't dare arrest him. Others, like the bar owner and the White Russian prostitutes, didn't dare help the foreign sailor. They wrestled for a long time. Eventually, the foreign sailor's strength waned, and he couldn't beat him, so he fled back into the bar. He returned home triumphantly, as excited as a national hero returning from victory.</p>
<p>However, he was injured! He was admitted to the hospital the next day.</p>
<p>In the hospital, his fever reached 105 degrees. During the day, he rambled in his sleep.</p>
<p>"That sailor, that foreign butcher, hit him, hit him, send him back home!"</p>
<p>"Marilyn, Marilyn, you're back? I beat up that foreign sailor."</p>
<p>"You don't approve? You say I was reckless? I was fighting imperialism!"</p>
<p>"Marilyn, Marilyn, why are you angry with me?…"</p>
<p>"Marilyn, darling, you can't leave me!"</p>
<p>"Marilyn, you have to understand me."</p>
<p>"Marilyn, Marilyn! You! You!…"</p>
<p>He went mad! He hit the nurse, cursing her as a foreign scoundrel. He jumped out of bed, hitting everyone, disrupting the order of the hospital.</p>
<p>Marilyn, the day he was admitted to the hospital, I sent you a telegram. Didn't you receive it? How could you bear not to come and see him? It's your fault!</p>
<p>Your fault is not understanding him. Don't argue. Although you understand his state of mind, you don't understand why he feels that way. That's why you don't understand him.</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, a young person with thoughts, a mind, and ambition must participate in political movements. Their keen senses feel the pulse of the oppressed people. They must run to the forefront of the times to do something beneficial for the country, society, and humanity. Once deceived by the environment, discouraged by indifferent companions, and faced with a bleak political future… all kinds of stimulation will inevitably lead to resentment and a search for numbness. This kind of disillusionment and sorrow of decline is given to him by the times, and it is also brought on by his own class destiny. Renjie is one of many such young people. You don't understand his kind of depression and distress because you lack political thought. Can you say it's his fault that he didn't teach you to understand?</p>
<p>Marilyn, you should recognize yourself. You are a woman who has fallen behind!</p>

<h3>The Rise of Nude Films (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Guangdao</p>
<p>The Trend That Was Seen in Advance</p>
<p>The United States Has Already Begun Preparing New Films</p>
<p>Everyone is asking now: "Will nude films, in the near future, become a trend, a recognized genre of film, like the 'Westerns' or 'Social Films' we already have?" Or: "Will young Mr. and Mrs. Smith be debating one evening in a year or two whether to take their children to a travel film or a nude film?" Please don't say it's impossible or won't happen. Because nude films have already appeared in America. Films of nude movements are already visible. The actors inside are all naked. And many more are already in production. Now almost every filmmaker is turning the idea over in their mind, thinking of ideas on how to apply the purpose of this newly emerging nude movement to shoot some timely films.</p>
<p>"Back to Nature" is the pioneer of nude films. It has already given American filmmakers in general an impression of a possible trend. When it is shown, the audience in the theater is packed to the brim. The second film, written by Bryan Foy, is "Elysia," which is more intimate and dramatic. Its attraction is even greater than "Back to Nature." This subject matter, in the midst of a lack of boring subjects, seems to have discovered a new field, making everyone feel endless excitement and stimulation.</p>
<p>The love story of a nude movement practitioner is bound to be fresher and more interesting than all the current "clothed films." Many filmmakers have already foreseen the near future and are thinking about what actors to use to shoot this new style of film. But how much longer will it be before they can discuss in meetings whether the Garbos or Dietrichs will shoot a film for winter, or wait until spring and shoot a "clothed" film first? Please don't laugh either, because this ideal will soon become a reality. If you don't believe it, look at Paramount's recent contract with Sally Rand. Sally Rand is a nude dancer at the Chicago World's Fair. Paramount, seeing her voluptuous figure, recruited her and gave her a contract of $5,000 a week. Although there is no talk of shooting nude films yet, Paramount's forward-looking approach clearly indicates the future direction of filmmaking.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Greta Garbo is very much in favor of this new movement. If there were an appropriate nude film script for her to do, she would definitely be willing to take off her clothes and perform, because she is originally a believer in nude sunbathing. In addition, there are many other stars who are already turning the idea over in their minds, considering this issue. Try closing your eyes and imagining Joan Crawford and Clark Gable as the two leads in a nude love film! Or Johnny Weissmuller and Jean Harlow! And the most surprising thing is that Mae West, with her voluptuous figure and overflowing charm, is a woman who opposes nude films. She says that taking off clothes is something everyone can do, but to truly achieve artistic touch that elevates the viewer's imagination to the clouds, one must wear clothes. Therefore, women must have appropriate clothing and know how to apply them before they can become popular. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Warner Brothers' Approach to the Blue Eagle Movement</h3>
<p>— Anding</p>
<p>Since the Democratic Party's Roosevelt took office in the United States, Warner Brothers has been transformed into a Democratic propaganda machine in an invisible way. The art of film is now used by every country as a tool of education and propaganda. Socialist Soviet Union, Fascist Italy and Germany have all given full play to its role of propaganda and education. Capitalist America, of course, cannot be an exception, so since Roosevelt came to power, Warner Brothers has become a propaganda weapon in the Blue Eagle movement.</p>
<p>The second war of plunder among international powers is about to break out in an instant. The clever Roosevelt, he knows that the crisis of the Second World War is at hand, he knows that he will again drive millions of innocent people to the battlefield, to be the victims of their rulers, the ruling parties, the bankers, ×× kings... and so on. Therefore, he had no choice but to start a narcotic movement. At the same time, he could also take the opportunity to attack the opposition party - the Republican Party, to gain public sympathy and consolidate the power of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In 1933, under the command of the Democratic Party, Warner Brothers produced films on a large scale to promote Roosevelt's revival movement. For example, "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street," which have been screened in Shanghai and take unemployed workers as their subject. Now there is another film on the subject of veteran soldiers, "Heroes For Sale" (this film: the Japanese translation is America's discussion of Russia), but according to the original text, it should be translated as: "Heroes for Sale" or "Heroes Priceless"). In the past, such American films, apart from entertainment and intoxication, had no other purpose, but now, it is very different. For example, "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Heroes For Sale" have actually become the mouthpiece for propagating the Democratic Party's political program. Now that Warner Brothers has such a political background, its approach, of course, also "changes" with the overall situation.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a very important question in the United States, which is the "question of veterans." Warner Company of the Democratic Party, in order to win the sympathy of the people, used the slogan of "opposing the suspension of veterans' allowances," to produce the film "Wild Boys of the Road." The production of "Wild Boys of the Road" is based on these three principles:</p>
<p>(1) Opposing the suspension of veterans' allowances,</p>
<p>(2) The treatment of veterans,</p>
<p>(3) Relief movement for the unemployed. The content describes that in the spring of the previous year (February 1932), more than 20,000 veterans came to Washington, D.C., surrounded the White House, paraded and gave speeches, opposing the Republican Party's abandonment of support during its administration, and demanding that the government fulfill its obligations. However, that sensational demonstration was distorted by Warner Brothers. It simply insulted that heroic struggle and the more than 20,000 fighters.</p>
<p>Now the golden land of the New World is filled with cries of hunger. But can the Blue Eagle movement save the current America? Can the millions of "forgotten good people" - veterans and unemployed workers - who are oppressed by hunger and cold get bread from Roosevelt's hands?</p>
<h3>Anna Sten's Coco Dance Bing</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Russian star Anna Sten, since joining United Artists in Hollywood, has not been on camera for a long time because she is too fat. Now she will be starring in a new film, Gola's Nana. In this new film, she will be performing a special dance, called the "Coco" dance, Can Can dance, which has never been seen in any country. There are also two Coco dance songs, which she will also be singing. Now she is very capable of being on camera, she has reduced her weight from 150 pounds to 120 pounds, and is able to dance easily.</p>
<p>Anna Sten has a special skill, she can perform the expressions of many characters at the same time. Once, she performed fifty-one different people at United Artists, she can change her hair, and can change her voice, change her attitude, from a child to a mother. She is showing off this special skill in the Coco Dance.</p>
<p>Because Anna Sten is not good at speaking English, she is now behind the others. In fact, she has very good art. She used to star in four films, but she only said a few simple words. Now her English is very good. According to Maurice Sheffordstone, the manager of United Artists, his comment on her is that she will definitely be a promising figure in the film industry in the future.</p>
<h3>Gary Cooper's Heartbreak</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Many people think that a beautiful star like Gary Cooper enjoys all the pleasures of life, but the fact is completely the opposite, he often tastes the pain of heartbreak!</p>
<p>His first love was a classmate in college, named Therese. Gary left her in his hometown and ran to Hollywood to find his "luck." He finally got a chance to be a bit player in a martial arts film. During this time, because he was not diligent in corresponding with Therese, Therese thought he had abandoned her, so she married the village pharmacist.</p>
<p>He also had an affair with flapper girl Clara Bow. At that time, Clara Bow was already a famous star, and he was only a newcomer to the silver screen, so this matter was mostly initiated by the woman. But the frivolous Clara Bow would never be satisfied with the "country bumpkin" Gary forever, so their romance soon disappeared.</p>
<p>Later, he fell in love with the passionate Mexican girl Lupe Vélez. However, in less than a year, she ran away. Cooper went to Africa to hunt, also because of this heartbreak.</p>
<h3>Shi Dongshan Writes "Woman"</h3>
<p>— Waves</p>
<p>Starring Li Minghui and Hu Ping</p>
<p>Shi Dongshan's film "Woman" is about to start shooting. Because the script review committee was very satisfied with the script of "Woman," written by Shi Dongshan of Yihua Company, and at the same time, wrote these words on another page of the script: "This film is quite meaningful and close to worldly sentiment." Naturally, this is tantamount to giving many people in Yihua Company a shot of excitement.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shi Dongshan is preparing to make some slight modifications before officially starting shooting. Here, I will tell you a few of the leading actors in this film below:</p>
<p>Female lead: (1) Li Minghui, (2) Hu Ping, (3) Huang Naishuang. Male lead: (1) Wang Yin, (2) Wang Naidong, (3) Qin Tong. Other male and female key roles are also people with a very high position in the film industry.</p>
<p>It is said that: One of the female leads in "Woman" is very suitable for Li Minghui's personality, so Shi Dongshan thought of many ways to invite Li Minghui, and Li Minghui was also very willing. Of course, with the consent of both parties, the female lead of "Woman" is no problem. In this way, you can always know that the opening date of "Woman" is not far away.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Broadway Thru a Keyhole (4)</h3>
<p>— Xinzhi</p>
<p>"Those are two different things," she said. Roche then asked her, "Do you know that there are only you and me here, it's already past midnight, and you're sitting on my bed now?" Joan raised her head and looked at him, she said, "But I believe you." Roche smiled helplessly. He took one of her hands and touched it very kindly. He said, "Joan, you're right. You can believe me. I'm going to send you home right away. You've lost your beauty sleep, go and make it up." As he said this, he really sent Joan Huilan back.</p>
<p>The next day, Roche ran to the business office of the Calais nightclub. He said to the old boss lady of the nightclub, Tex, "How about letting me have this place for 20,000 yuan?" Tex sat casually in a large chair, took a cigarette, put it in a very long ivory cigarette holder, and slowly said, "What can or cannot be done, just let you have it." Roche then ordered Chuck to find Max, the director of the dance. After a while, Chuck and Max came. Roche asked him, "Isn't Joan Huilan dancing pretty well?" The dance director was a little scared when he saw Roche and couldn't speak for a while. Roche said to Max again, "You can adjust the program and find a way to get Joan Huilan to be a leading role." Max threw his hand away and said to Roche, "Mr. Roche, you're joking. Do you want to see a miracle? What you're asking for is simply impossible." The thief leader restrained his anger and said, "Max, I'm afraid you misunderstood. I don't have any requests for you. If I tell you to do this, just do it." Max looked very embarrassed. But he had no way to disobey the order of this new boss.</p>
<p>Max worked hard to coach this newly born singing and dancing star for a few days. On the night of the premiere of the new show, Joan Huilan was in her dressing room. Her sister, Yiseier, and Chuck's girlfriend, Sybil, were also there. Yiseier said to Joan: Everyone outside will definitely be surprised, how come there is such a new character in the Calais nightclub, and she has become a pillar of the stage as soon as she comes. Everyone will also think that someone must have bribed the Calais nightclub. Why bribe? Of course, it cannot escape a universal law, that is, the command of love." Joan said, "I still don't understand what he means." After a while, a film newspaper was sent in. Joan opened it and saw the words: "Joan, take care. Roche." Her hand trembled. She said, "The time has come, I must do well!"</p>
<p>Joan went on stage. Roche watched silently on stage. He looked at Joan, and then at the faces of the guests sitting at the tables below the stage.</p>
<p>He knew Joan was very good. When the performance was nearing its climax, everyone's emotions became tense as well. Then there was a burst of crazy shouting and applause. After the play was over, Roche ran to Joan's dressing room. Joan was then lying on her sister Yisai'er's shoulders, crying and laughing, shouting, "Oh, I'm so happy, they all like me so much!" She said it over and over again. From then on, Roche did not miss a night at the Calais nightclub, and he did not miss buying flowers to send to the new lead in the nightclub. (To be continued)</p>
