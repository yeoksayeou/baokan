<h3 id="c11">北方將設政治分會 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>據日來北平方面傳來消息。北方將組設政治分會。俾政治重責由各人分擔。至政治分會委員之名額。亦已預擬爲二十七或三十三。北方數省軍政領袖。名皆列入。并傳聞推張學良爲主席。中央對此計劃。亦頗認爲適當。此内憂外患交相煎逼。國脈絲屬。民命塗炭之際。萬民喁喁仰望。正切盼舉國上下都能誠心悔禍。以新生之决心。謀舉國堅固之團結。摧毁歷來官僚政治武力政治之根基。掃盪歷來四分五裂割據稱雄之現象。以鞏固中樞。統一行政。澄清政治。而樹立國家永固之基。吾人誠不信今日之所傳。遂爲事實。然而所傳旣如此其詳確。同時更就各方面之情勢而推斷。則吾人又不得不信。且無法吾認其必將成爲事實。如其果眞。則今後之中國。殆將日益進入荆天棘地之窮途。殆終將陷入萬刦不復之深淵。</p>
<p>吾人認爲我國家二十年來之擾攘紛亂。戰禍連綿。政治窳敗。民困水火。皆由於軍人之專政。皆由於政客之煽亂。軍人利政客則憑軍人爲靠山。營營逐逐。惟利是爭惟權是競。有利則合。無利則分。政客又從中而鼓吹煽動。於是内戰以起。間或以一時之均勢形成。而獲得暫時之苟安迨均勢打破。而武力攘奪之新局又成。人慾横　。正義斷絶。此種個人利已主義之中心思想。支配中國之政治。自北洋軍閥袁世凱曹吳以迄今日。蓋一脈相承。毫無二式。故今日非掊覆軍人政治之根基。决難以謀國内之統一。政治之清明。更無以固我國基。同時吾人就軍人之立塲而爲之打算。假如終始角逐於利慾。不以大衆之福利爲念。使一人而爲大衆之公敵。則世代滄桑。政治狂濤下所捲没之「英雄」「梟傑」。遠者且勿論。即自袁世凱數至目前倖存者有幾陳跡歷歷。覆軌可鑒。回頭岸上。亦應放下屠刀。</p>
<p>數徧今日我國内二十八省區。幾無一省不自成一種勢力。無一省不自成爲一小朝廷。回溯我國歷史上春秋戰國時代之分崩離析。殆亦不過如斯。政治中樞有名無實。號令不出京門。行政末由統一。此所以致今日之亂。所以有災莫能救。有寇末能禦。有土末能守。坐視山河破碎。敵騎咆哮國家民族都被置於生死綫上。而各諉其責。毫不動心。</p>
<p>所謂政治分會之制。過去不久。亦已試行。武漢有之。廣州有之。北平有之。然而結果則何如吾。人應尚未忘却。今日此種制度之復活。此說之復興是否從事實上從理論上覓得其復活之必要。換言之。即是否眞於我國家於我人民有若何之福利。結合數省區自成一政治中心。在事實上旣儼然復活曹吳時代南北對峙之局。更愈以使人心浮動。無所依附。民族之精神。愈趨於渙散。吾人但見其種亡國之惡因。未見其有若何之福利。</p>
<p>國危矣。日已佔領東北。法將染指西南。洪水衝激。災黎千萬國無亡日民無死所。憤之所積。不難造成政治上突變之危機即其不然外患日益迫近瓜分之禍。寖成事實。吾人復何忍以小我之利害。陷我國民族於萬刦不復。在今日情勢之下。我舉國上下。惟有各犧牲小我。以大衆之利益爲前提。以民族之福利爲前提。各安其分。各盡其責。各歛戢其野心。以共赴國難。組設政治分會。其動機爲國耶。爲民耶。抑爲一已耶。吾人竊期期以爲不可并敢抗聲以問。</p>

<p>自由平等者、亦所以謀世界人類之解放、求各民族之自由平等在今日各國經濟危險狀况組織之下三民主義能爲之闢一蹊徑、方翊贊效法之不遑、固無所用其侵略伎倆也、</p>
<p>三·大學敎育之目標</p>
<p>（甲）現代文化之認識三民主義之實施、必須有充實之敎育以建設、黨義學程之在各級學校講授、固可深可淺、但在大學中則宜使學生有澈底之了解、對於三民主義之眞正價值、須有明切之鑑識、是非從現代文化以探求、必難窺兄三民主義之基礎及其氤氲形成之動因背影與環境、更非用世界文化之視點、不足以估定三民主義之價值、今日之大學敎育、其課程之改造編配、自爲專家之事要之三民主義化之大學敎育、其所培植之人才、必須通曉現代之文化、融會貫通、使其思想行動集中於三民主義之立塲、對於國家建設社會建設與物質建設、所需之基本社會科學、自然科學、精研學理之究竟與注重生産技術之智識與技能、以期創造三民主義的文化價值及完成物質建設、並養成努力服務之精神、及領導民衆之能力、</p>
<p>（乙）三民主義之陶鑄三民主義之敎育非僅標榜三民主義之名目所能受效、而在大學中亦非僅如今之添設黨義一學程所能畢事、必須使一切環境設施、學生整個身心全部督貫之以三民主義敎育之精神、各科學督以三民主義爲中心有若輻射焉、而以無處不具備三民主義之功用爲歸結、然後方可達民族精神之獨立、民權實施之普遍、民生發揚之目的、至於中華民國敎育宗旨及實施方針、業經中國國民黨第三次全國代表大會明白確定、而其實施之詳明規劃、亦經中央執委會妥爲審訂關於高等敎育之目標、節引如次</p>
<p>一、學生應切實理解三民主義的眞諦、並具有實用科學的知能、俾克實現三民主義之使命</p>
<p>二、學校應發揮學術機關之機能、俾成爲文化的中心</p>
<p>三課程應視國家建設之需要爲依歸、以收爲國儲材之效、</p>
<p>四、訓育應以三民主義爲中心、養成德智體、美羣兼備之人格、</p>
<p>五設備應力求充實、並與課程訓育相關聯觀以上目標、則於大學敎育之方針、宜如何實施設備以陶鑄三民主義之人材、中央規定之原則可資準繩也、</p>

<p>我並不是像頑固的老先生、絶對主張保存長袍馬褂、說西裝是蠻夷之服、倘使將來中國自已能供給西裝一切的材料、我也很贊成大家穿西裝可是現在還談不到、現在西裝所用的材料、那樣不是外國來的日本人的改穿西裝是本國會製造西裝材料之後纔普遍的、就與中國人的骨氣不同、世界上只有眞心愛國的人纔可使外國人看得起、甘地是個好榜樣、口裡說愛國、全身用外國貨的人、便不是眞愛國只有被外國人所轉視、有什麽漂亮可言、有什麽風頭可出呢、外國貨之在中國、已經像水銀地無孔不人、除了服裝的材料之外、當然還有很多可以不必用而中國人偏要用的外國貨、但是、服裝是人生所必需、而且消耗最入、所以我們不得不先加以注意男女學生們你們要救國嗎、請你們切切不要用外國貨的服裝、敎員們你們要救國嗎、請你們切切不要穿外國貨的服裝給學生看這是救國同志們所必須做而最容易做的件事、這一件小小表示眞心愛國的事倘使不能做、不願做、不肯澈底做、那末請你們不必貼標語、不必呼口號、不必罷課示威、不必打電報、不必赴京請願、大家馬馬虎虎等着做亡國奴罷了、（未完）</p>

<p>▲打破航海紀録　昨據該公司言康德洛沙新船、准定一月下旬由意國開出在二月内、即可到上海、刻已派定三月十一日由滬開頭班赴意、此船發動力之巨、行駛速度之快在遠東歐洲班内、堪　空前的第一船、由滬赴意大利、經香港·新加坡·及里海取道Levant白林狄西Brindis維納西Venice到典禮西德Priest祇須二十四天、便可到達矣、該輪行駛後、將此中歐海程可縮减三分之一矣</p>

<p>犬養毅爲日本之老民黨。亦爲吾國孫中山先生三十年前深相結納之老友。而此次犬氏以政友會之捧塲＝不惜以皤然皓首七十餘歲之老翁。重登政治舞台上。以顯其强硬侵略之策畫。再伸其手腕於吾東北。行將盡達其田中時代遺下傳統一貫之野心。是犬養毅之組閣。於吾國前途。大有咄咄偪人之勢。</p>
<p>昨與余友秦君慕三。偶談及此。秦君亦聞而唏嘘。繼乃拍案起曰「爾何憂之甚。耶」。叩其所以。則謂「日本縱有犬。不知吾國有馬。犬雖較狗爲大。但不能守户耳。以犬組閣。不過一犬子也。豈若馬之能奔軼絶塵。載將士以决勝於彊塲。捍衛我邊圉之爲愈乎。」余方知以「馬」對「犬。恰是巧合。因問「養毅」三字。何以撇開謂有「秀芳」兩字在。足以當之。今馬占山將軍。以絶域單師。苦心抗日。爲全國所崇拜。人皆知其名。而不知其字稱「秀芳」。不免有負英雄。余復悟以「秀芳」對「養毅」。洵屬工穩確切。秦君眞别具會心。芳有此吐屬也或謂「秀芳」二字失之柔。不及「養毅」之剛。余曰否否不然。吾國素尚和平。柔　足以克剛。而剛終爲柔所撓。挫折以消滅者。世不知凡幾也。於是其議遂定。囑余志之。以實本談。</p>
<h3 id="c173">記最近失事之大德輪 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>本年三月間。大達公司之大吉輪。中途着火。慘斃多命。記者嘗爲文記之。乃事隔未久。該公司之大德輪又以被焚聞。死傷之巨。損失之重。視前有加。誠海上之空前浩刦也。</p>
<p>查大達公司爲南通先賢張季直氏所創辦。其行外江者。初爲大濟。大順。大德。大和四輪。嗣大濟。大順因輪體過小。或出售。或改航。另由公司添購大慶。大吉二輪以承其乏春間大吉被燬。近始修竣出塢。更名大豫。故事實上公司現有之四輪。爲大德。大和。大慶。大豫等。</p>
<p>四輪往返於滬揚之間。生涯鼎盛。大豫。大慶均爲新船。噸位較巨。設備亦佳。大和機件最優。行駛迅捷。大德則體微力弱。通揚人士。稱之曰「老太婆」。非不得已時不願乘坐。蓋由通至滬。他輪午刻可抵達者。大德非午後三四時不辦。近年機件稍有更易。視前略有進步。　在通揚人觀</p>

<p>— 費文寶</p>
<p>國府主席自蔣介石氏辭職下野後。繼任者爲年高德劭之老同志林超氏。林名森。姓名分析。共成五木。滑稽者稱爲五柳先生。查五行之中。木能克土。比者暴日無道。侵吾疆土。東北長官。坐視河山淪陷。而不加抵抗。此三省國土。或將由林老主席設法而克復之。吾國民將拭目以觀其後。（却酬）</p>
<p>之。大德仍爲四輪中之最劣者。</p>
<p>在昔張季直氏在日。往來通滬。必就大德。非利其遲緩。蓋以大德船底較闊。行駛無顚盪之苦也。此次失慎。由於棉花艙中之香烟頭。該輪管理之疏忽。於此可見。聞地方人士。已請交通部嚴加整頓。亡羊補牢。雖曰未晩。然數百人之生命。究將何處取償耶。</p>
<p>事出後。前國民政府財政部印花稅處長沈卓吾已失踪。其戚屬慘遭焚斃。惟亦有幸而獲免者。南通江蘇銀行行長顧伯言君。當大德輪由滬開出時。已包定二樓房艙。夜十二時。並已登輪。乃友人某君。忽喘息而至。再三邀約。請改乘志大輪赴揚州一游。然後返通。顧以情不可却。遂改乘志大得免於難。又輪着火以後。旅客紛紛躍入江中。該地雖屬淺灘。然天寒潮急。多數凍斃。且有凍斃之屍體。直立泥沙中。如同冰人者。可謂慘極痛極。又有旅客某甲。於事出後。竊得一巨箱。將箱中物抛棄一空已則仰臥箱中。滾浮水上。嗣爲漁户救起得慶更生。</p>
<p>按滬揚輪船。向極平安。數十年來。未嘗有變。乃今春大吉被焚之後。秋間大德輪在六圩又爲匪徒所洗刦。今更全船着火。雖公司損失。亦不下數十萬。然平日對於管理方法。如貨艙與閑人隔絶。派警護航。增設消防等。倘能注意。又豈不能防患於未然也耶。往者已矣。來日方長。深願該公司諸董事能銳意革新。不負先賢慘澹經營之苦心也。</p>

<p>— 青年援馬園一團員</p>
<p>（三）離眞茹</p>
<p>九日晨。我們謝别了曁大同學抗日救國會之後。全體團員便望南翔進行。没有個把鐘頭光景。目的地已見着了。車站有歡迎的市民代表。我們很漸愧地在古漪園受他們的歡迎。勗勉。晚上在中心小學寄宿。</p>
<p>本來我們不必步行的。因爲中央政府已諒解了我們並蒙撥給頭等車輛供本團乘坐。但我們僅接受政府的好意與向政府致謝却全體决不乘坐所備車輛。因爲這樣才能表現我們青年堅忍的精神。也可以磨練我們的魄力。爲赴黑龍江的準備。</p>
<p>下午有崑山及蘇州的市民代表前來探問行程及日期。據說以便歡迎云云。但我們自想。爲國犧牲是國民應盡的義務。今竟擾勞各界人土。中心未免過不去呵。</p>
<p>十日有一團員退出。他本來不願退出的。因爲他家裏的人說「你不回去。便將全家死在南翔。」但我們所有的團員。都是自動加入的。當加入時。必經審查組嚴密考慮過。對於團員的軍事學識耐苦精神。以及有無家累等等。都要問明白。才認爲合格的。毫没有煽誘或强逼的形式要青年們加入。所以。這位團員不肯回去時。我們也要勸他退出呢。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>美國學生。因爲政治觀念淡薄。所以對於政治舞臺上的人物。也不甚注意。不甚了解。甚且一個大學生。不知道他們的政府的組織。如在我國。不說是大學生。便是一部分中學生。也會知道得很清楚。誰是中央要人。誰是某省主席。差不多大家能舉出其姓字。美國普通學生知道電影明星。運動健將的。恐怕要比知道政治舞臺上的人物還要多。美國每逢選舉。如選總統。或選州長。市長時。各州各市鄉都有選舉的塲所。然而不去參加投票的人很多很多。一般民案固不必論。就是智識階級的份子。也有不少人放棄他的權利。總之他們對於政治。不感到濃厚的興趣就是了。</p>
<p>我國近來爲了國難。全國人民。痛國亡無日。一致向政府建議。請願。尚有無數青年學生。奔走呼籲。請願。示威。羣情憤激。要想給麻木不仁的當局。一個當頭棒喝。我認爲這種愛國運動。其志可敬。其情却十分可憐。一個求學時代的人。不能讓他安安靜靜去求學問。而去爲政治奔走呼號。忍飢耐寒還不算。有時還要中奸人的詭計。同受當局的壓迫。這是何等對不住他們的事。有人說。「學生不應該與聞政治。」我想在政治清明之國。這是很自然的傾向。祗要看美國大學生對於政治的興味就知道了。可是在崩潰支離的中國。時時有劇烈的刺激。學生如何能對於政治抱冷靜的態度呢。所謂「救國不　　書。」理論上却是很對。但在這危機四伏存亡一瞬的當兒。怎能使他們安心讀書。所謂「敎育救國」「實業救國」……等名詞。也都是適用於平時。而目前的最大關鍵。却在於政治。政府當局一言可以興邦。一言可以喪邦。政治不上軌道。無論是敎育。實業……。一切都没有希望。還有人說。當普法之戰。巴黎郊外隱聞砲聲。市内學生猶能靜心上課。自然。他們有救國衛民的大將軍。在前線殺敵應戰。無後顧之憂。返觀我國則何如。敵兵壓境。棄戈而逃。幾天之内。斷送三省領土。怎能和法國比較呢。所以美國學生對於政治不感興趣。正是他們的福氣。不是他們的弱點。我國學生比起來。就不幸得多了。</p>

<p>次日早上。華乃强用過早餐。正悶沉沉的坐在客室中。披閱地圖。忽見忠淑翩然而入。面有憂色。乃强請伊坐下。對伊說道。我看地圖。距離Ｔ城西南。有一高山。那邊倚山帶河。正好據守。足爲Ｔ城屏蔽。尊大人爲未雨綢繆之計。何不速遣一旅人馬駐守在那裏。以扼敵人進攻之路。忠淑把足下革履一蹬道。乃强兄。還要說這夢話做甚。我老實告訴你罷。我父親已投順太陽軍了。華乃强一聞此言。直跳起來說道。怎……怎的他已甘心降賊麽。忠淑　道。昨日晚上。我父親整個黄昏在密室中討論軍事。我曾到那邊來窺探。見有幾個太陽國人一同在内。鬼鬼祟祟的不知商議什麽。我瞧了非常疑訝。一時又見不到我的父親。今天早晨跑到父親房中一問。方知眞相。唉……忠淑說至此。頓了一頓。華乃强道。眞相如何。忠淑道。原來我父親已受了太陽國人的利誘勢逼。變了心腸。甘心做他們的走狗。將要起兵攻打Ｈ省。聽說今日太陽國人有大批械彈運送前來。接濟我父親的軍隊。明天便要進攻Ｈ省了。乃强兄這事怎麽辦呢。我不幸而爲賣國賊之女。我想不如離開這裏罷。我眞不忍瞧見這可悲的情形。華乃强揑緊拳頭。在桌子上一拍道。賣國賊。我不該當着女士的面。駡你的父親。他眞是臘油蒙塞了心竅。不想爲張瞧陽流芳百世。却願效吳三桂貽臭萬年。老悖昏庸。至於極點。我中國竟有這種軍人。我的血已沸了。賣國賊人人得而誅之。華乃强說罷。氣得面色都青了。忠淑掩着面哭泣起來。良久又說道。我無面目再生人世。我就一死罷。乃强兄請爲國珍重。早些離開這裏爲妙。乃强把兩手搓着。只是沉思。忠淑的說話如同不聞一般。隔了一刻。華乃强把手向忠淑摇摇道。女士别哭。我今想得一個計策在此。不知女士贊成不贊成。忠淑果然止了哭泣。將手絹拭着珠涙。很注意的問道。有何良計。乃强却又躊躇道。這却很難說的。忠淑道。什麽事都可說。此間左右無人。快說快說。華乃强便走到伊身畔。凑着伊的耳朶說了許多話。然後又着雙手。退立在桌子邊靜候伊解决。</p>

<p>侯厚培吳覺農著</p>
<p>黎明書局出版</p>
<p>中國的著作界本來窮乏得可以、無論那方面的著作、都感到欠缺、但是比較起來、關於日本帝國主義的著作、尤其在九一八事件以後、確比他方面的著作要多些、上至二三十萬字的大著、下至數千字的小册子、以目下出版界的窮乏程度來說、已不能算作沉寂了、而在這許多研究日本問題的著作中、我們却不能不特别提出這本丨侯厚培吳覺農農合著的「日本帝國主義對華經濟侵略」、這原因大概可分爲丨丨</p>
<p>第一、正如本書著者在例言中所說、「日本對華侵略處心積慮、爲時已久、此次侵占遼吉、即日本帝國主義在華侵略之充分表現、事件之發生、雖爲暴力的形式、然無論爲近因爲遠因、實際上全以經濟爲背景、日本在華經濟上所占之勢力、較其他諸國爲優厚、經濟上侵略之方式、亦較其他諸國爲積極、對華經濟侵略之成功、即日本帝國主義大陸政策之成功、」以經濟侵略來解說日本對華侵略的全部、確實把握住了問題的中心、明瞭了日本對華經濟侵略的内容、就可知道日本侵略中國之野心及方法的全部、現在市上所流行的關於日本帝國主義的著作、不是僅顧到問題的一角都是僅顧到問題的表面、這是本書和其他的不同的地方之一、</p>
<p>第二、日本對華侵略、是整個的問題、不是部份的問題、換句話說、日本對華侵略、是有其一貫的政策的、决不是局部的或一方面的問題、如最近田中侵略滿蒙積極政策中有云、「以滿蒙之權利爲施令塔、而攫取全支那之利源、以支那之富源、而作征服印度南洋羣島小亞細亞及歐羅巴之用、我大和民族之欲揚武於亞細亞大陸者、握執滿蒙權利、乃其第一大關鍵也、况最後之勝利賴於食糧、工業之隆盛恃原料、國力之充實、實賴於中國之廣大領土也、」是以局部的記載或叙述、必不能明瞭日本帝國主義侵略的一貫政策、現在市上所有關於日本帝國主義的著作、大部是偏於一面、尤其是偏於東三省、殊不知日本帝國主義對華侵略是多方面並進的、而且各方面又是互相呼應的、所以東减省事件不過是日本對華全部侵略中之一部份、或是說最明顯的一部份、但如要瞭解日本整個的侵略政策、非進而明瞭在華本部的經濟勢力不可、而且亦可以說、如不明瞭日本在華全部的經濟勢力、對於東三省事件亦不能有正確的認識的、本書立論的對象是全國、並不限於任何一部份、固然、日本的經濟勢力以在東三省爲最重大、但有許多經濟事情、却非東三省所有的、本書取材均稱、這是和所有這方面的書籍不同的别一點、</p>
<p>第三、材料是書籍的命脈、直言之、書的好壞全視材料如何而定的、現在市上關於日本問題的書籍、所取的材料不但大部是陳腐不堪、而且是輾轉抄襲、不問材料來源如何、以誤傳誤、以致一錯到</p>
<p>能有「原始材料」即「直接材料」的、眞是麟角鳳毛了、而本書則「全用實際材料作客觀的叙述、…其材料之搜集、以直接取材爲主、或由個人直接調查、或採集日人向不流傳外面之營業報告、會議録、名册等加以編制而成、故書中各項統計、頗爲翔　、其他由中西各種書報上所取之材料、亦必詳細參照、安爲校正、始行轉録」其他不說、即就日本浪人所得之秘密報告、有如益世報所揭載所謂滿蒙權利擁護會議録一類的材料、本書中亦有許多、如日人在上海企業統計、出口商統計等、不僅向來没有人知道、就是有意去調查、亦很難有結果的、這是本書爲其他這方面的書籍所不能及的地方、</p>
<p>這三點是本書和其他這方面的書籍主要的不同點、亦就是本書超越其他書籍的地方、</p>
<p>著者以爲「日本帝國主義對華經濟侵略之政策、不外兩種、一爲對華投資、一爲掠奪市塲、本書編制即根據此兩種政策立論、第一章說明其對華經濟政策之由來及其侵略之方式、第二第三第四第五第六第七等六章、爲關於投資及市塲部份、分别叙述其侵略之步驟及最近之狀勢、第八章爲輔助投資及市塲侵略之金融機關、推究日本對華經濟侵略之必然性、舉凡鐵路航業農林礦業工業貿易金融等經濟侵略事項、均一併列入」、全書的章目所以分爲、第一章日本對華之經濟侵略政策、第二章日本對華之鐵路侵略、第三章日本對華之航權侵略、第四章日本對華之農業侵略、第五章日本對華之礦權侵略、第六章日本對華之工業侵略、第七章日本對華之貿易侵略、第八章日本對華之金融侵略、全書四百頁、</p>
<p>都二十萬言、不能不推爲研究日本帝國主義、對華侵略的著作中洋洋大觀、</p>
<p>研究日本帝國主義對華經濟侵略、</p>
<p>很容易流入於一種缺陷中去、便是、不是没有實證材料的空論、便是一筆流水帳、對於事實没有理論的解釋、上面已經說過、本書的實際材料不但豐富完備而且多是直接的新材料那末、本書是否祇是一種事實的陳述、而没有正確的理論的闡明呢、决不、本書理論的貫澈與深刻、和其所收集的材料有同等的價值有許多地方、一針見血、多是發人所未發的、譬如第一章著者正確地舉出、日本對華經濟侵略的由來、是由於、第一人口過剩與糧食恐慌、第二、原料缺乏生計困難、第三、開闢市塲發展貿易、其侵略之手段、歷來不外三種、</p>
<p>一、威迫利誘政策丨關於這點、著者說、如甲午役、我國失敗訂立馬關條約、及袁世凱稱帝、日本威逼我國訂立二十一條、以及民十七年濟南慘案、蒙古事件、均威逼政策之表現、亦即田中之所謂積極政策、或以强取權利、培養貿易之政策也、至於日本政府對於地方軍人之威逼利誘政策、更不勝枚舉、</p>
<p>二、侵佔利權政策丨如以前之鐵道競爭、借欵競爭、歷年日本滿鐵會社事業經營之發展、以及長江流域紡織工業之營造、在在均可表現日本之投資政策、而尤以民國六七年間段祺瑞主持内閣時、與日本締結軍械借欵、無綫電信借欵、開拓森林借欵吉林借欵、善後借欵等條約爲最鉅、日本此時一方面借貸巨額的資金與中國、一方　利用爲擔保物而掠奪其利權與財産、藉以發展日本在華之經濟勢力、</p>
<p>三、破壞和平政策丨這節講得更爲清楚而深刻、「分而制之、爲日本近年對華之傳統政策、遠如民國五年之援助宗社黨起事、民國七年之助段祺瑞練參戰軍、皆爲助長我國内亂之明證、郭松齡倒戈、日本出兵南滿、乃維持滿洲舊有親日勢力也、北伐軍興、迭次出兵山東、乃所以維持直魯殘餘軍閥之勢力也、奉系失敗、張作霖皇姑屯被炸、乃所另謀扶持滿蒙新勢力之企圖也、自此以後、東北一變而爲反日之勢力、於是日人乃惕又不安、卒有最近佔領遼吉之舉、……」</p>
<p>日本對華經侵略中、主要的是投資與市塲二點、日本對華投資、可分爲兩大類、其一爲國家資本、即以日本國家之</p>

<p>名義、或由日本之國家銀行直接借欵於中國政府、或投資與某種企業、例如一九○九年中國向日本所借二百十五萬日元之吉長鐵路借欵、一九一一年一千萬圓日金之郵傳部借欵、皆其先例、其二爲日本金融資本家、即日本所稱爲財閥者、投資於中國之各種企業、其目的在獲得各項利權、此項資本、侵入於吾國農林、商礦、交通、工塲等各項企業、凡屬有利可圖、幾於無孔不入、此種投資、以東三省爲中心、而以長江一帶爲根幹、</p>
<p>投資之外、厥爲市塲侵略、日本對華市塲侵略之重要、可於日本民政黨開第五十九次年會議時、幹事長富田幸次郎聲明詞中見之、「與日本距離最近、關係最切者、莫過於東洋市塲若、然日本對於重要之東洋市塲、似未加以相當之重視、不論對中國及對南洋其輸出入之大部份、皆屬之歐美各國、現就中國方面之輸入貿易觀察之、日本僅能占其百分之三十、其餘百分之七十、皆非我有、以如此鄰接之大市塲、任令放棄、殊非發展日本國家經濟之道、故吾人對此所謂東洋經市塲、尤如中國者、不能不採取指導親善之方針、以應付之也、」是其對華市塲侵略之野心及急切已躍然紙上、</p>
<p>日本對於經濟侵略的各部門、雖則互相關聯而且是整個的、但各有其手段或方策、關於這種事、本書中皆有極詳盡之叙述與發、在此日本帝國主義積極侵略聲中、本書確爲瞭解日本侵略之方式及性質的絶好參攷、總之概括起來、全書的重要特點、可分爲四種、</p>
<p>一、日本對華、經濟侵略的實際統計、正確完備、應有盡有、</p>
<p>二、所取材料多爲最近直接材料、搜集不易、至爲名貴、</p>
<p>三、全書以中國全國爲論述對象、不僅詳於東三省一部、凡日本經濟勢力所及、如長江流域一帶、莫不詳述無遺、四、理論與事實並重、以實際材料來證明理論、以深入理論、來　發事實、毫無枯燥及空論之弊、</p>

<p>（四）日本侵略中國的時期、作者分爲四個段落、（一）嘗試時期（一八六七丨一八九三）、這時期内日本給中國訂立了幾張賣身契、即同治十三年的中日條約和光緒十一年的天津條約、（二）發端時期（一八九四丨一九○四）這時期内日帝國主義者已大肆其侵略、我國割了臺灣琉球、失了朝鮮、賠欵三萬萬五千萬、辛丑條約的締結、日俄戰爭的結果、「日本勢力已支配滿州、而滿州危矣、」（三）積極時期、（一九○五丨一九一四）日本在滿州的經營、因爲種種不平等條約的訂立、已大告成功了、（四）横行時期、（一九一四年丨現在）日本老實不客氣的露出其獰猙面孔、横行無忌了二十一條的苛刻要求、長春事件、福州事件……以及最近的濟南大慘殺、以及目前的東省暴力佔領、是這侵略史蹟中之最高點了、</p>
<p>以上作者很平易的解答這篇侵略史各種因素、不明瞭歷史的動力、怎樣了解歷史事實、作者在此篇的努力是帮助我們去認識歷史解釋歷史的、這是讀者似乎不可忽略的部分、</p>
<p>第二部述六十年來侵略中國的經過事實、按照年代分爲四個時期、叙述詳簡得宜、是一部很好的史料、篇末在最近更增添了一章、即一日本强佔東三省案、分着下述的幾節、（一）慘案發生的前夜、（二）慘案發生的經過、（三）我國之退讓與交涉之經過、作者在結束的時候、很憤慨的說道　　「我以爲日本旣蓄意永佔滿蒙、則此案無論爲國際聯盟會處理、無論爲直接交涉、其决無良好的結果、可以斷言、亡國在邇、我全國四萬萬同胞與其坐以待斃、曷若臂奮起與日本决一死戰之爲愈、甯爲戰死鬼、不作亡國奴、吾同胞其勉諸、其勉諸、」</p>
<p>「這態度怕就是每一個讀者的態度吧　　第三部爲「六十年來侵略中國成績的總統計」、這是從横的方面記載的、從各種統計數字中、每一個讀者總要驚心動魄地認識帝國主義者的「爲利益奮鬥」的所在了、全篇分領土·軍事·政治·經濟·文化五部分、每部分都給讀者以很多的事實證明、很大的數字證明、中國是如何蹂躪在日本鐵蹄之下呀、</p>
<p>在結論中、作者的意見我是完全同意的、他說、「中國不欲生存則已、如果要維持他的生存、非起來打倒妨碍中國生存的日本帝國主義者不可、</p>
<p>「我們從中華民族的生存上來講、中國是被壓迫民族、日本是壓迫中國最兇惡的帝國主義、我們立於民族平等觀點上和民族生存的要求上、我們要反抗日本的壓迫、我們要求中華民族的自由獨立、從日本的層層壓迫之下去解放我們的民族、</p>

<p>The Garrison Headquarters Dispatches a Large Number of Military Police</p>
<p>Central University Surrounded Before Dawn</p>
<p>Escorted onto Trains and Ships for Dispatch Back to Their Native Places</p>
<p>Arrested Students to be Sent to Court</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Students from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Beijing, and other places. Since the Central Party Headquarters and Central Daily News incident occurred, the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, in order to maintain city security, began dispatching students on the 18th at dawn. The process was as follows: The headquarters, considering the demonstration groups originally scheduled to demonstrate again at 10:00 AM today, dispatched two regiments of the 61st Division's direct subordinate troops, one regiment of the Military Police Headquarters Traffic Military Police Corps, and a thousand members of the Capital Police Department's security team around 4:00 AM, distributing them at Chengxian Street, Dashiqiao, Shipopoxiang, and Central University for temporary guard duty, and prepared twenty cargo trucks for use. Around 5:00 AM, students from various places were gathered in the large playground. Brigade Commander Zhang gave a speech, saying, "I deeply believe that the actions of destroying the Central Party Headquarters and Central Daily News were instigated by a few, and most were coerced. The Central government can extremely forgive this. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of saving the country in the future to rescue China, which is in critical condition. Do not be seduced by reactionaries and lose the nation's vitality." After speaking, he ordered the troops to escort the students, loading them onto the headquarters' traffic trucks that had been prepared beforehand. First, the Anhui students were transported to Pukou, then Suzhou, then Shanghai, and finally Beiping. Before leaving, each person was given one yuan in loose change. A majority of the student teams volunteered to march out of the school on foot, with the military escorting them front and back. Students from Peking University began marching to Drum Tower at 11:00 AM, chanting slogans along the way. At 12:00 PM, the Jiangning District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhu Fengsi, Zhang Rucheng, and Medical Officer Yi Xin to examine Yang Tongheng, who died after falling into the river yesterday during the Central Daily News incident. They found six head injuries, which were pre-mortem fall injuries, blood in the nose, and blue, purple, white, and black bruises on the legs. The upper body was black and white. The Ministry of Education dispatched the Chief of General Affairs Section, Li Zhenxia, to prepare clothing and a coffin for the burial, which was arranged at Shimiaokou. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) By 12:00 PM today, the dispatch of students had been completed. Anhui students left by river steamer, Hebei and Shandong students boarded trains at Pukou, and Shanghai students were sent away on the Beijing-Shanghai train. It is reported that Guangdong faction committee members Sun Ke and others have a joint explanation regarding the student petition and the measures taken, which will be released within days. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, the Garrison Command arrested a total of sixty-three students. Thirty-eight have now been released, mostly from Shanghai schools. Twenty-five remain, mostly from Beiping schools, and are to be prosecuted according to law. After approval from Chen Mingshu, they will be transferred to the court. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Garrison Command dispatched two armored cars to patrol the streets, each with a white flag bearing the words "Martial Law." (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Command announced the situation of forcing students from various places to leave Beijing on the 18th as follows: (1) Song Xilian's unit, a brigade commander of the First and Second Regiments of the Guard Army, the Second Regiment of Volunteers, and two squadrons of the police department's security team, under Song's command, arrived near Central University at 5:00 AM on the 18th. Military police surrounded the</p>

<p>After surrounding the school, the remaining troops entered through the main gate in formation, guarding the student dormitories on different routes, raising banners with large characters written on white cloth. Central University students concentrated in the school headquarters dormitory, and students from other schools formed teams by school and gathered in the playground. After gathering, they boarded trains and ships in formation and immediately returned to their schools. They were required to complete the gathering immediately, and forced execution would be carried out if they were late. Those who dared to riot would be punished according to the methods for dealing with rioters. Patriotic students should not be used by reactionary elements as tools for their sacrifices, etc. After deployment, the students got up one after another. Seeing armed military police outside, they had no intention of resisting, so they were ordered to carry their luggage and gather at the locations indicated on the banners. (2) Nanjing students were the first to gather and requested to depart and return to their provinces. However, a small number of students from Shanghai and Beiping expressed their unwillingness and made radical remarks. Also, a portion of Central University students did not obey the signs to gather and rushed out of the dormitories, acting recklessly, threatening a clash. At that time, in order to avoid conflict, the troops fired a blank shot into the sky to suppress them, so nothing else happened. (3) Many reactionary slogans and leaflets were found in the school. In the stairwell on the third floor of the auditorium, Yi Jintang, an investigator from the Garrison Command who had been captured and imprisoned by seventeen students, and a policeman were found, both severely beaten. However, the four workers who the Central Party Headquarters instructed to find who had been beaten, captured, and disappeared by the students have not yet been found. (4) According to Central Party Headquarters staff, during the students' disturbance of the headquarters on the 17th, male and female students were witnessed waving red flags and shouting Communist Party slogans. After memorizing their appearance, staff members identified She Wanneng and Xue Shengyu, two students from Beiping, and detained them for interrogation. (5) Around 12:00 PM, about six or seven hundred students from Beiping, about two thousand five hundred students from Jinan, and about a thousand students from Shanghai were escorted to the Pukou and Xiaguan train stations in sequence. A total of three trains were boarded at Pukou Station, with Jinan students on two trains and Beiping students on one train. Shanghai students boarded a train at Xiaguan. Brigade Commander Song sent a company on each train, ordering them to escort the students to Bengbu and Zhenjiang, etc., to prevent them from escaping and remaining in the capital area. Also, because the road to Beiping was far, each student was given one yuan for food. About three hundred students from Anhui were also sent to Xiaguan and given two hundred yuan to hire two small boats to transport them back to their hometowns. (6) The Traffic Military Police Corps was ordered to move into Central University on the morning of the 18th. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Meeting of Nanjing and Guangdong Representatives <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Preparing for the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Decision to Hold a Talk Today</p>
<p>The Guangdong Committee Establishes a Temporary Office</p>
<p>The Secretariats Will Merge Work</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the preparatory matters for the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Sun Zhesheng and other five representatives had an informal discussion with Lin Sen, Chen Mingshu, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, and others at Iron Department Official Residence No. 1 on the morning of the 18th. It was decided that a talk would be held at the Central Party Headquarters at 8:00 AM on the 19th to exchange opinions. At the same time, with the consent of the committees, a General Assembly Secretariat would be organized to be responsible for preparing everything, and it was decided to appoint staff during the meeting, and discuss requested proposals and other matters. The five representatives from Guangdong then gathered Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Chen Bijun, Gan Naikang, Tang Shengzhi, Bai Yunti, and more than ten others at the Iron Department Official Residence to discuss the opinions to be put forward at the talk on the 19th. Research was also done on issues such as party affairs, politics, and diplomacy in preparation for submitting proposals to the plenary session. At the same time, the National Salvation Conference program was also discussed briefly. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the formal talk between the Nanjing and Guangdong Executive and Supervisory Committee members on the 19th, the personnel of the secretariats will merge work. Committee member and staff badges were issued on the afternoon of the 18th. The joint proposal of the Guangdong Committee has been drafted and is being organized and co-signed. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guangdong Committee members have set up a temporary office at No. 4 Iron Department Official Residence to handle all matters, and have appointed Zhong Tianxin and Cheng Yuanzhen to be responsible for receiving the press from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM and from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM every day to release news. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth Central Committee Reception Office has sent personnel to repair Kong Xiangxi's old residence in Xiangpu Camp to prepare a place for Wang Jingwei to stay when he comes to Nanjing. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiqing, Pan Yunchao, Wang Faqin, and five others, eight committee members in total, arrived from Shanghai yesterday, bringing the total number of Guangdong committee members to twenty-two. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, the five Guangdong peace negotiation representatives met with Lin Sen, Wu Tiecheng, and other responsible personnel from the Nanjing side at Sun Ke's residence in the Iron Department Official Residence for preliminary discussions. It was originally decided to hold a talk at 3:00 PM this afternoon, where the central committee members from both Nanjing and Guangdong would gather together. It was then changed to a formal talk at the Central Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 19th to openly exchange opinions. Therefore, the committee members who came from Shanghai today were busy with private visits and discussions, mostly verbal. It is said that the topics discussed by the committee members were mostly focused on the student patriotic movement, Deng Yanda's death sentence, and Hu Hanmin's stay in</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Hong Kong. Regarding the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, both parties intend to establish a joint secretariat before the meeting, which will be organized by an equal number of people from Nanjing and Guangdong. The regulations and candidates will be decided at the talk on the morning of the 19th. Also, the meeting was originally scheduled for the 21st, but it is generally believed that the number of central committee members in Beijing is insufficient, and some central committee members from Guangdong may not be able to arrive in time, so it may be postponed. This will also be decided at the meeting on the morning of the 19th. The committee members believe that Li Zongren's arrival in the north and Yan Feng's southward movement are signs of national peace and unification. The condition of Wang Jingwei's illness is also a concern for the committee members, and everyone hopes that he can recover soon and come to Beijing to participate in the meeting despite his illness. The Guangdong Committee has appointed Zhu Puzhi to go to Shanghai on the night train on the 18th to welcome him. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Wenfan talks about the National Salvation Conference: (1) Unite the national masses and jointly shoulder the task of saving the country; (2) Shorten the period of political tutelage and implement constitutional government as soon as possible. After the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee closes, the unified government will be formed, and the National Salvation Conference will also be established at this time. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Faqin talks: When we are at the conference, the various proposals regarding the reform of the party, government, and military will be based on the program decided at the Shanghai Peace Conference. Other proposals have not yet been decided in draft form because Wang has been ill for many days and the committee members have only been in Shanghai for a short time. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain central committee member talks: Currently, all important political issues must be resolved at the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee or after the establishment of the unified government produced by the plenary session. For example, how the National Salvation Conference should be organized, whether the Provisional Constitution should be amended, whether the political sub-committee should be re-established, and how diplomatic policy should be determined are all extremely important and must be carefully considered in order to establish a permanent and fundamental plan so that internal stability and external conquest can be achieved with expected results. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Faqin told reporters: I just took off my travel clothes and have not yet had the opportunity to meet with my comrades here. Regarding the opening of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, we have already had an informal talk at the Iron Department this morning to exchange opinions. The principles for reforming the party, government, and military system established at the Shanghai Peace Conference should be discussed within the plenary session to prepare a concrete plan for new construction so that it can be established as soon as possible. However, it has not yet been fully drafted. Two principles have been determined for diplomatic issues: (1) Safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity; (2) Preparing the necessary defensive strength to resist at the right time. The current situation is still urgent and cannot be achieved with empty words. How to make a practical plan is a major responsibility that our party, especially the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, should bear. We must discuss it in advance and cooperate in a spirit of cooperation to seek an appropriate solution. This is the view of my colleagues who have come here. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Military Authorities Express Desire to Attack Jinzhou <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Inland Divisions Continue to Move Out</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of the Army issued an article today detailing the rampant activities of bandits in South Manchuria, and said that Zhang Xueliang was responsible for the turmoil in Manchuria. Therefore, Japan now has no choice but to eliminate the disturbing elements in the area west of the Liao River. Observers of the situation here all say that this article by the Ministry of the Army actually indicates that Japan will launch a large-scale attack on Jinzhou at any moment and drive all the Chinese troops stationed in Jinzhou into the customs. Also, according to recent news from Fanyang, Chinese and Japanese troops had fierce fighting near Gaotaipu. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Officials here hope that Zhang Xueliang will withdraw his troops into the customs in order to avoid the possibility of conflict between the two armies. However, Reuters later learned from responsible sources that the order prohibiting Japanese troops from advancing west of the Liao River, dated November 27, has now been revoked. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the incident in Shenyang, news has come from Japanese sources that the situation between the Chinese and Japanese troops is becoming increasingly tense. Former Minister of the Army Nan is planning to personally go to Manchuria next week to investigate the actual situation. Japanese official reports claim that Chinese troops are advancing from the Beining Railway, but these official reports are probably prepared for international propaganda purposes because the Japanese army has recently had the ambition to expand its sphere of influence and wants Chinese troops to retreat into the customs. Furthermore, the situation in Xinmin is also extremely worrying. There is a large Japanese garrison in the area, which has now requested assistance from Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army to send troops. The Japanese cabinet has also approved the dispatch of reinforcements to Manchuria, which has now been implemented. A part of the Third Division's most elite troops, led by Ishikawa, has departed from Nagano and entered Manchuria. Japanese official reports also claim that Chinese troops have been transferred from Jinzhou to Baiqibao, and there are also 5,000 unofficial troops simultaneously moving towards Xinmin. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, it was learned from responsible sources that the order prohibiting Japanese troops from advancing west of the Liao River has now been revoked. People in London are very worried about this. However, all sectors of the Japanese community here say that the revocation of the order should not be regarded as a serious development. These people hope that Zhang Xueliang can withdraw his troops into the customs in order to avoid possible conflict. People in the League of Nations say that neutral inspectors are still on the ground, and the League of Nations must receive their reports before it can assess the harm caused by illegal elements mentioned by Aizawa at the last meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Aizawa is expected to depart from here around the 28th or 29th of this month, taking the Trans-Siberian Railway to return to his country and take up the post of Foreign Minister in the new government.

The people of the country don't need to worry about me. However, before receiving orders from the government and before the Japanese army invades, our army has decided not to counterattack for the time being. Zhang Changguan Jinghui will send personnel to maintain Heihe's security and finances. The weather in the north is extremely cold and the Heihe army's uniforms are thin. Personnel have been sent to Harbin to order 15,000 leather jackets and 20,000 pairs of felt blankets." (17th Special Telegram)</p>

Zang said that he accepted the position reluctantly at the request of the people and that his policy was to be friendly to the outside world. He also said that the affairs of the previous government were not open, which led to inaccurate news in the newspapers. He hoped that this situation would now change so that the published information would be reliable. In order to achieve this goal, he promised news reporters frequent contact with various government agencies.

<h3 id="e11">The North Will Establish a Political Branch <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>According to news coming from Beiping in recent days, the North will establish a political branch, so that the heavy responsibilities of politics can be shared by everyone. The number of members of the political branch has also been preliminarily set at twenty-seven or thirty-three. The names of military and political leaders from several northern provinces are all included. It is also rumored that Zhang Xueliang will be recommended as chairman. The central government also considers this plan to be quite appropriate. At this time, when internal and external troubles are pressing, the nation's lifeline is hanging by a thread, and the people are suffering, the people are eagerly looking up and earnestly hoping that the entire country, from top to bottom, can sincerely repent of past mistakes and, with a new determination, seek a nationwide and firm unity, destroy the foundations of bureaucratic and militarist politics of the past, sweep away the phenomena of disunity and separatism that have prevailed throughout history, so as to consolidate the central authority, unify administration, clarify politics, and establish a solid foundation for the nation. We sincerely do not believe that what is being reported today will become a reality. However, since the reports are so detailed, and at the same time, judging from the circumstances in all aspects, we cannot help but believe it and cannot deny that it will inevitably become a reality. If this is indeed the case, then China in the future will gradually enter a hopeless situation, and will eventually fall into an abyss of no return.</p>
<p>We believe that the disturbances, chaos, and continuous warfare in our country over the past twenty years, the corruption of politics, and the suffering of the people are all due to the autocracy of the military and the instigation of politicians. Politicians rely on the military as a backing for their own benefit. They are preoccupied and only compete for profits and power. They unite when there is benefit, and they divide when there is no benefit. Politicians also agitate and instigate from within, and thus internal wars arise. Sometimes a temporary balance of power is formed, leading to temporary stability, but when the balance is broken, a new situation of military plunder emerges. Human desires run rampant, and justice is cut off. This kind of self-centered ideology dominates Chinese politics, from the Northern Warlord Yuan Shikai, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu to the present day. It has been consistent and unchanged. Therefore, today, unless we uproot the foundations of militarist politics, it will be difficult to achieve national unity and political clarity, and it will be even more impossible to consolidate our national foundation. At the same time, we are considering the military's position. If they continue to compete for personal gain and do not consider the welfare of the people, making one person the public enemy of the masses, then generations will change, and "heroes" and "villains" will be swept away by the political storms. Let's not talk about the distant past, but how many of those who survived from Yuan Shikai to the present remain? The past is vivid, and the overturned cart is a warning. To turn back and reach the shore, they should also lay down their butcher knives.</p>
<p>Counting the twenty-eight provinces and regions in our country today, almost no province does not form its own force, and no province does not become a small court. Looking back at the disintegration of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in our country's history, it was probably not much more than this. The central political authority is nominal and has no real power. Orders do not leave the capital city. Administration cannot be unified. This is why today's chaos exists, why disasters cannot be rescued, why invaders cannot be resisted, why territory cannot be defended, and why we can only watch as our mountains and rivers are shattered, enemy cavalry roar, and the nation and its people are placed on the line of life and death, while everyone shirks their responsibility and remains unmoved.</p>
<p>The so-called political branch system was tried not long ago. It existed in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Beiping. But what were the results? People should not have forgotten. Today, is the revival of this kind of system, this kind of theory, based on a real need from a factual and theoretical perspective? In other words, does it really benefit our country and our people in any way? Combining several provinces and regions to form a political center has, in fact, revived the situation of the North-South confrontation of the Cao Kun and Wu Peifu era. It only makes people's hearts more agitated and unattached. The spirit of the nation is becoming more and more scattered. We only see that it sows the seeds of national demise and do not see any benefits.</p>
<p>The country is in danger. Japan has already occupied the Northeast. France is about to get involved in the Southwest. Floods are raging, and tens of millions of people are displaced. The country is in danger of perishing, and the people have nowhere to die. The accumulated anger may easily create a crisis of political upheaval. Even if that doesn't happen, foreign troubles are increasingly imminent, and the disaster of partition is becoming a reality. How can we bear to sacrifice our country and its people for the sake of our own petty interests? In today's situation, all of us in the country, from top to bottom, must sacrifice our individual interests and prioritize the interests of the masses and the welfare of the nation. Each of us must stay in our place, fulfill our responsibilities, and restrain our ambitions to overcome the national crisis together. Is the establishment of a political branch for the sake of the country? For the sake of the people? Or for the sake of oneself? We hope this is not the case and dare to ask loudly.</p>

<p>Plans to Establish a Governor-General's Office for Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>Former Minister of the Army Ordered to Inspect</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of Manchuria and Mongolia, has decided to implement a governor-general system for Manchuria and Mongolia or a Manchurian governor system at the same time that the Manchurian Incident comes to an end. The three chiefs of the army have concluded that General Nanzō Jirō, the former Minister of the Army and military councillor, should be recommended as the first governor-general or governor. (Eighteenth, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Minister of the Army General Nanzō has been entrusted with an important mission by the central army authorities. He is scheduled to depart for Manchuria on the 20th to express his condolences to the troops stationed there, as well as to inspect the current state of military operations and the construction of Manchuria. (Eighteenth, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) In order to implement its Manchuria-Mongolia policy, the Japanese government believes that it is an urgent task to establish a Manchurian Governor-General's Office to control various agencies in Manchuria. Before the Manchurian Governor-General's Office is organized, the Kwantung Army Headquarters will set up a governing department within the headquarters today as an interim measure. (Eighteenth, Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There is widespread speculation here that the government intends to establish a central organization in Manchuria to unify military and civilian policies. Currently, administration comes from four sources: (1) the Director of Civil Administration of Kwantung, (2) the President of the South Manchurian Railway, (3) the Commander of the Kwantung Army, and (4) the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang. Although it is generally believed that a unified plan has many advantages, official circles are highly doubtful about the feasibility of implementing this plan. The former Minister of the Army in the previous cabinet, Nanzō, has been entrusted with a special mission and will be heading to Manchuria soon. It is likely that the position of Director of Civil Administration of Kwantung, as well as the position of Consul-General in Shenyang, will be filled by important figures with the status of ambassadors. All these changes show that the government is paying greater attention to the administration of Japanese people in Manchuria, and it can also be seen as a sign that military and civilian affairs will be concentrated in one place in the future.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an admonishment to students across the country, saying that since the national crisis occurred, students across the country have been driven by patriotic enthusiasm to call for and run about. Although their actions have sometimes been excessive, the government has always tolerated them in order to maintain popular morale. More than 45,000 people have come to Nanjing to petition one after another. All of them were frankly and earnestly instructed, and they returned happily. However, reactionary elements saw that the government was safeguarding patriotic actions, so they borrowed the name to carry out destructive work, inciting young people to destroy railway traffic, destroy public institutions, beat public officials, arbitrarily bind people for interrogation, and harm social order. Such things have been seen frequently. The people are complaining, and friendly countries are puzzled. The government has repeatedly issued clear orders to persuade them, hoping that they will be brought back to the right track. However, on December 15, more than 200 students in Beiping destroyed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then broke into the Central Party Headquarters, carrying wooden sticks, hiding pistols, distributing reactionary leaflets, and seizing police guns, resulting in the beating of Cai Yuanpei and Chen Mingshu, members of the committee. The government should have severely punished them according to the law, but it hoped to promote the awareness of the whole body, so it earnestly warned the perpetrators arrested on the spot and released them leniently. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 17th, more than 1,000 students, carrying wooden sticks and iron bars, besieged the Central Party Headquarters. Some of them temporarily changed to wearing red armbands, prominently displayed red bandit flags, and distributed red bandit leaflets. When they attacked and destroyed the front row of doors from the inside, they arrested Party Headquarters staff outside, held them for more than three hours without being able to enter, and then smashed the Central Daily News and set it on fire. The fire was put out by the military police.</p>
<p>Personnel were immediately beaten, causing injuries to Wen Liang, secretary of the Executive Yuan, and four others, as well as Wang Pi and five other Party Headquarters staff, and workers Ren Fengfa and gang police were arrested and taken away, with no trace of them. Such disruptive order and disruption of security are clearly rioting behaviors and absolutely cannot be used as an excuse for patriotic movements. In addition to separately investigating and dealing with those who were arrested on the spot for committing arson and violence, in the future, local officials should severely deal with riotous behaviors under the guise of patriotism in order to maintain order and ensure public safety. It is hoped that the young students across the country will quickly realize that the reactionary elements should not be used and sacrificed. They should know that obeying laws and disciplines is to maintain the country, and abiding by order is to maintain national strength. This is very obvious, and it is hoped that all the people of the country will understand it together. (Eighteenth, Central News Agency)</p>

The original text is as follows: "Submitted for the purpose of requesting resignation. The Japanese bandits are rampant and invading our country. Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and Heilongjiang is following. China has raised millions of soldiers, but no one dares to speak of war, sitting and waiting for death, is it not suicide? I am a soldier and should be willing to die. I only know how to save the country and do not care about anything else. Therefore, I have repeatedly asked to go to Heilongjiang to help, but for more than a month, I have not been approved. I heard that the National Government has issued an order to prepare for an expedition, and your seat has spoken of going to the national crisis together. All officers and soldiers of the army are overjoyed, so I rushed back while sick to ask for instructions on the key points. However, things did not go as planned, and the departure was indefinitely delayed. The sincerity of saving the country is foolish, and I cannot die. The people and subordinates of the country are accusing each other. The government may have other difficulties, but the masses cannot forgive it. After thinking again and again, I can only resign from my various positions, so that I can go to the Northeast to help with the national crisis as a citizen, to repay the Party and the country and thank the people. My sincere loyalty, I beg you to examine and approve it, and I also beg you to forward it to the National Government for the record, it is convenient for the public."

<p>Yoshizawa Plans a Short Stay in Russia</p>
<p>Saionji's Condition Slightly Improves</p>
<p>▲ Domei, Tokyo, 18th - The Minseito Party is paying close attention to the new cabinet's budget plan. Observing the published outline, the financial reorganization largely follows the previous cabinet's plan, but it rejects tax increases and tariff increases, instead using the issuance of public bonds as a source of funds. Yesterday, in the name of Secretary-General Nagai, the following opposition opinion was published: "The new government's budget policy destroys the tax system reorganization created by the previous cabinet to correct the imbalance of the national burden, abandoning the tax increase plan with social policy significance (because the tax increase makes the class with tax-paying ability bear the burden), and its alternative source of funds is sought from public bonds to deal with the temporary. This policy is deceiving the people and destroying the foundation of finance. At the same time as banning the export of gold, it deteriorates international lending and leads the people's lives to danger. Therefore, our party absolutely cannot recognize it."</p>

<p>Selection of German Delegation Determined</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Geneva, 17th - League of Nations Disarmament Committee Director Agethenet will probably persuade former British Prime Minister Henderson to give up his post as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference.

Although officials say that Agethenet's trip is only to consult with Henderson on a few specific issues related to the conference, the public does not believe this, because since Henderson was elected as Chairman of the Conference, there have been new developments that make it inconvenient for Henderson to continue in this role and hinder the progress of the conference. Henderson's attitude is not yet known. Perhaps, due to physical weakness, he will retire voluntarily.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Zang Shiyi Willing to be Surrounded by Japanese <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲ American Reporter Visiting Zang Denied by Japanese</p>
<p>▲ Li Yi Discusses Zang's Current Environment</p>
<p>The American Evening News, Shenyang, 17th, reports that the correspondent of the American Evening News went to see Zang Shiyi this morning and presented his card to the gatekeeper, asking him to lead him to Zang's office. After waiting for a while, a Japanese man in a suit came out, claiming to be Zang's private secretary, saying that Chairman Zang was very busy and had no time to meet with news reporters. He instructed the reporter (American Evening News) to prepare a number of questions and leave them for reply in a few days. The reporter asked why Japanese newspapers had published news of Zang's interview with news reporters, but he had no time to meet with an American reporter. The Japanese man directly replied that Chairman Zang could not meet with the American reporter at this time. He asked to leave a phone number and be notified later. The reporter then asked if there were any Chinese employees in the office who could lead him to Chairman Zang's office. The Japanese man coldly replied that they were upstairs. Then the reporter walked to the waiting room and waited quietly for development. At that time, a Chinese man, Li Yijun, appeared. Li once served as the magistrate of Shenyang County, saying that Zang was very willing to meet with news reporters, but was obviously inconvenient due to the current environment. He was very sorry. He also said that Zang reluctantly agreed to be the chairman at the request of merchants and businessmen who were dissatisfied with the administration of Yuan Jinkai's maintenance association and requested Zang to be the chairman, hoping to restore order in the province. As for Zang's future attitude towards Zhang Xueliang or the central government, it is not yet possible to say, because the chairman believes that the provincial government is only temporary, so the future political issues of the three northeastern provinces must be decided in the future. The reporter asked if the Japanese newspapers quoted Zang's remarks criticizing Zhang Xueliang and Chiang Kai-shek. Li leaned forward and spoke secretly to the reporter, claiming that he did not believe the reliability of this statement, because Zang and Zhang Xueliang were old friends for many years. The reporter then asked about the Japanese newspaper's statement that Zang would ask the Japanese army to drive out the Chinese troops in Jinzhou. Li said that Zang could not make this request, but the Japanese army might make this statement so that it could use this as an excuse to send troops to Jinzhou. Later, Li secretly told the reporter that Zang was completely surrounded by Japanese secret agents and was not free at all, and was also completely unfamiliar with the local situation in the three northeastern provinces and the political situation in China. He only took the position of chairman because he could not bear to reject the requests of those who own property here. The reporter then asked when the inauguration ceremony would be held. Li replied that it would be within a day or two, but finally Li also admitted that Zang had not seen any local Chinese since he was detained and released by the Japanese, and those who had seen him were only Japanese soldiers. At this point in the conversation, a servant rushed into the room and told Li that the chairman did not want him to talk to the American news reporter. The reporter had no choice but to say goodbye and leave. The American consul here has been trying to meet with Zang, but has not been able to do so, only getting a statement that Zang will issue a declaration soon.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Replacement of Mayor of Qingdao <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲Hu Ruoyu transferred to Beiping</p>
<p>▲Shen Honglie temporarily acting as Mayor</p>
<p>Qingdao correspondence: The talk of replacing the Mayor of Qingdao has been circulating for many days. However, due to many difficulties in selecting a successor, it has been delayed. Mayor Hu Ruoyu left Qingdao for Beiping a few days ago, taking his family and luggage with him. It was speculated that he might not return to his post. Indeed, yesterday (the 15th), Zhang Xueliang telegraphed that Hu Ruoyu had been transferred to work in the Beiping Deputy Commander's Office. His vacant post as Mayor of Qingdao has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and Shen Honglie, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Navy, has been temporarily appointed to act concurrently. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Shen officially took over at the Municipal Government Hall at 4 PM today (the 16th). The details of the replacement and Mr. Shen's assumption of office are described below:</p>
<p>▲Process of Replacing the Mayor: Since the Northeast Incident, there have been rumors of Hu Ruoyu resigning. Zhang Xueliang did send someone to signal to Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, asking him to recommend someone to take over. However, Han, considering the national crisis, felt it was inappropriate to participate in the change of local officials and humbly declined. However, Hu's attitude was passive, and he repeatedly telegraphed Beiping to resign. At the same time, Zhang also faced difficulties with the Northeast Navy's finances. If Mr. Shen concurrently serves as the Mayor of Qingdao, funds for the navy can be raised nearby. Furthermore, since Mr. Shen has been in Qingdao for many years and has connections with people from all walks of life, it would be easier to handle affairs. This is how Hu left and Shen succeeded.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Shen's Assumption of Office: Shen Honglie officially took office at the Municipal Government Hall at 4 PM today. About 400 representatives from all sectors and municipal government officials attended. After taking office, Mr. Shen announced three policy guidelines for the future: (1) Division between the Navy and Municipal Affairs: As a military man concurrently serving as Mayor, the boundaries between military and municipal affairs must be clearly defined because the nature of the Navy and municipal affairs are completely different. The Navy is consumptive and defensive, while municipal affairs are constructive and conservative. Although their natures are opposite, their functions complement each other completely. Since Qingdao was taken over, all administrative affairs have made steady progress. I will follow the established rules and regulations. Regarding municipal construction matters, whether predetermined by the previous administration or not yet planned, as long as they benefit the local area, I will do my best to carry them out and will never let the Navy affect municipal affairs. This is in terms of funding. As for personnel and administration, they will also never be mixed to hinder the progress of municipal affairs. (2) Cultivating Local Vitality: To cultivate local vitality, it is essential to eliminate corruption and promote benefits. The city has a large population with diverse backgrounds, making it difficult to avoid bad habits. Mayor Hu has always been committed to eradicating social ills, and I will continue to do so to cultivate the fundamental morality and physical strength of the citizens. As for promoting benefits, there are many aspects, but the most important are education and port affairs. Since Mayor Hu took office, port affairs have made significant progress. For example, the Port Affairs Fund Custody Committee is well-intentioned and beautifully managed, and I will continue to do so as before. Education should be practical, and this aspect will be discussed with the competent authorities to make contributions. (3) Maintaining Local Tranquility: Maintaining public order in this city, where Chinese and foreigners live together, is the most important responsibility of the military and government authorities. This should be divided into symptomatic and fundamental treatments. For the past ten years, the Navy has cooperated with the Public Security Bureau to maintain public order in the city. Fortunately, there have been no major incidents. In the future, the military and police should strengthen their joint defense. However, this is a symptomatic treatment. The fundamental solution lies in the citizens' clear understanding of the country's status and the city's status, as well as the responsibilities of citizens, with a spirit of unity, and using self-governance to govern others to the best of their abilities. On the one hand, it prevents the hiding of local scoundrels, and on the other hand, it integrates with local foreigners. If everyone can be self-reliant and there is a sound society, there will be no hidden worries. After Mr. Shen's speech, City Party Department representative Yi Yiwun, Councillor Miu Mengxiong, and City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Song Yuting spoke in succession, followed by a group photo and dismissal.

<p>Continuation of Middle School Students Destroying the Party Headquarters: The incident of students from various middle schools in Wuxian destroying the Party Headquarters and beating Party Committee members was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Party Committee members also reported the injuries and destruction to the Provincial Party Headquarters that night, requesting instructions. Some committee members went to the province on the 18th to report in person. Yesterday (the 18th) at 9 AM, about 1,000 students from various schools arrived at the sports field. At 10:30 AM, they went to the County Party Headquarters, but there were only a few service staff inside and no Party Committee members were seen. However, they saw that the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag in the auditorium had been destroyed by the Party Headquarters themselves. Therefore, they turned to the County Government to petition. The County Magistrate was out on official business, so Zhao Jintang came out to meet the students. The students demanded three points: (1) Guarantee patriotic movements. (2) The Public Security Bureau must not suppress patriotic movements. (3) Demand proof that the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag in the County Party Headquarters were torn down by the Party Headquarters themselves, and that the Party Headquarters should apologize to the students.

<p>Middle School Students in the County Suspend Classes: Yesterday, the County Middle School received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Student Union, stating that from the 17th, all classes should be suspended to carry out propaganda. The County Middle School, upon receiving the order, immediately requested Principal Xu Yunfu to announce the suspension of classes.

<p>Former Construction Bureau Director Moved to the Police Station for Supervision: Former Director of the County Construction Bureau, Chen Qiwei, was detained by the new Director, Wang Yizeng, who telegraphed the province due to numerous improprieties in the handover procedures.

However, the local Public Security Bureau found it extremely troublesome to rotate officers on duty every day. Therefore, Director Yin negotiated with Chen, asking if Chen could temporarily reside in the Bureau to avoid complications, to which Chen agreed. He was moved to the Bureau the day before yesterday. On the 17th, the Construction Department sent technician Lu Yizhi to Changshu to investigate the case. It is heard that there are three important points: (1) The Changtai Highway project is unfinished, and the expenses have exceeded the original amount. Are there any inflated expenditures? (2) Problems with the relocation of graves and cattle sheds. (3) Are there any errors in the earthwork of the Changtai Road and the tea and water expenses issued? It is heard that Lu has gained some insight and will soon leave Changshu.</p>

<p>Improvement of Party Affairs Organization and Federation of Labor Unions: Since the establishment of the Executive and Supervisory Committee in Wuxi, the isolation between the Party Headquarters and the Party members has led to the dissipation of the will of Party members throughout the county.

Therefore, they convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of various districts at the First District Party Headquarters yesterday to discuss the improvement of Party affairs.

Taichang Cotton Seed Shop, which drifts sesame cakes outside the North Gate along the river, will close due to financial difficulties. The total loss is more than 20,000 yuan. Three money shops owe more than 9,000 yuan to the shop without any compensation. In addition, Zhou Yichang Coal Company in Beitang Coal Yard has also been stranded due to poor turnover, with a huge loss. As the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, it is feared that there will be a succession of merchants who cannot maintain their business.</p>

<p>Prison Official Deducts Prisoners' Food: Since Xu Xing took office as a prison guard, he has reduced the prisoners' food by two taels per meal, causing the prisoners to oppose and refuse to eat, causing a riot. Seeing the situation was not good, Xu reported to County Magistrate Ma and ordered Director Jiang of the Public Security Bureau and Supervisor Hua to lead the police to persuade them. The prisoners elected Chi Fufu as their representative and demanded four points: (1) The meal should still be twenty taels. (2) The original rice bowls are broken and need to be replaced. (3) Restore bathing once a week. (4) Shi Zaiqing should be released (Shi was previously punished for arguing over food). Hua expressed acceptance of three points and the fourth point would be handled after investigation. The prisoners agreed to resume eating, and the matter was resolved. The Provincial Party Headquarters Committee member Chen Zhongmin came to Cheng to investigate and punish the two Japanese yarn factories in Nanzha, and yesterday (16th) Chen went to Nanzha to investigate and then convened a meeting of student representatives in the afternoon to discuss (1) soliciting opinions on how to deal with Japanese goods, (2) expenses for volunteer army uniforms, and (3) evidence that Ren Shengxiang protects treacherous merchants. The results of the discussion (1) raised six doubts that the Japanese goods in Chengri seconds were illegal and hateful, requesting that they be handled in accordance with the provincial regulations. (2) The volunteer army's funding should be handled in accordance with the Anti-Japanese Association's resolution. Today (17th), Chen Wei will return to the province to report.</p>
<p>Middle Schools Suspend Classes: Jiangyin Middle Schools have been ordered by the Provincial School Anti-Japanese Association to hold a general strike today (17th). The representatives of the County Student Union were convened by Nanjing and resolved that during the strike, (1) expand propaganda, (2) intensify military training, and (3) study Japanese issues. Various organizations during the strike period: (1) Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Executive Committee, (2) Disciplinary Committee, and (3) autonomous courts organized by various schools. When the Acting President of the National Government takes office, he should contact the middle schools along the Jinghu Line and go to Beijing to petition.</p>

<p>Principal of Private Zhenjiang Middle School Paraded Through the Streets: Zhenjiang Middle Schools held a general strike yesterday and jointly held the second demonstration parade at 9 AM. They gathered at the public sports field, where Wei Changshou, Chairman of the Board, reported on the significance of the meeting, followed by speeches by various students. Then they held a parade. As the private Zhenjiang Middle School had not attended the scene, students from the school reported that it was because the principal did not allow them to join. Thousands of male and female students present were greatly agitated and rushed to the school, taking Principal Shen Pingzhou to the Memorial Tower at Dashikou and questioning him about his reasons for not participating. Shen's words were ambiguous, so the students wrote "Shen Pingzhou who obstructs students' patriotic movement" on a piece of paper, pasted it on his back, and forced him to parade with them. Passersby thronged the main streets.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Staff Demand Salaries: Due to the financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province this year, the staff of the Civil Affairs Department were owed salaries. At the time of the reorganization of the provincial government, when the financial and civil affairs departments were being changed, the staff of the Civil Affairs Department collectively demanded salaries from Director Hu Puan. Mr. Hu was quite embarrassed and unable to respond. Chairman Ye promised to find a way, and the staff retreated.</p>

<p>Twists and Turns in Repairing the Canal Dike: It has been four months since the breach of the canal. Although the provincial government has made many plans, and the people of Jiangbei have repeatedly appealed, the project is too large and a complete calculation shows that it cannot be completed without four million yuan. Chairman Ye and Director Shen of the Construction Department convened representatives from Huaiyang counties to the province and announced to the public that there was already one million yuan from the province and one million yuan from the central government. The shortfall would be covered by 50,000 tons of American wheat, which could be used for work-for-relief purposes. It was said that the hope of the people of Jiangbei for the early restoration of the canal dike could absolutely be realized. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was reorganized, and it was recently learned from Beijing that the one million yuan assisted by the National Government had not been secured. The result of the provincial treasury's one million yuan was that the Finance Department only had 600,000 yuan and the amount of American wheat could not be determined. When the news came, the executive committee members of the Water Disaster Relief Association and the Water Disaster Tragedy Relief Association were extremely panicked. If the Beijing news is not false, the canal dike will never be repaired, and the disaster victims in more than ten counties will never have a home to return to. It is heard that the two associations plan to convene a temporary emergency executive committee immediately to discuss countermeasures to avoid delays and make it difficult to start construction. However, Han Zishi, the executive chairman of the association, has gone to Zhenjiang to discuss solutions with the new and old provincial chairmen. The outcome is not yet known.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Salary Demands by All Teachers and Staff: Although various schools and social education institutions in the county have been maintained as usual due to the lack of education funding this year, all teachers and staff, since this year's funding has not been secured and the salary arrears of five and a half months from last year are unlikely to be paid, discussed salary demands at Shixiao School at 3 PM yesterday (14th) and resolved to go to the County Government collectively to demand salaries. When they arrived at the County Government, Section Chief Wang Tingfan of the Third Section received them. After consultation, Section Chief Wang agreed to inform the County Magistrate and find a way to pay the old debts, and the teachers and staff dispersed. At 5 PM this afternoon, everyone gathered at the County Women's Elementary School, and the principals of various schools and the directors of various social education institutions went to the County Government to hear the news.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Plane Coming to Ningbo: Yesterday (16th) at 1:20 PM, a plane suddenly came from the north and circled before leaving. General officials and the public were baffled. It was later learned that the plane was indeed the one usually ridden by Chiang Kai-shek. However, Chiang Kai-shek did not come to Ningbo yesterday, but the plane was sent to Ningbo in advance to find out where it could land to ensure safety. It is also heard that everything in Chiang Kai-shek's private residence in Xikou, Fenghua, including the stove, has been prepared and that Chiang Kai-shek has decided to come to Ningbo by plane from Beijing within three days to recuperate.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Special Article: The Three Principles of the People and University Education (Continued 1) Zheng Hongnian <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Freedom and equality are also for the liberation of mankind and the pursuit of freedom and equality for all nations. Under today's economic crisis in various countries, the Three Principles of the People can open a path, and there is no need to imitate its aggressive tactics.</p>
<p>3.  Goals of University Education</p>
<p>(A) Understanding Modern Culture: The implementation of the Three Principles of the People must be constructed with substantial education. The teaching of Party ideology in schools at all levels can be deep or shallow, but in universities, students should have a thorough understanding. The true value of the Three Principles of the People must be clearly identified. It is difficult to glimpse the foundation of the Three Principles of the People and the reasons for its formation without exploring it from modern culture, and it is not enough to estimate the value of the Three Principles of the People without a world cultural perspective. Today's university education, its curriculum reform and allocation, is a matter for experts. In short, university education that is based on the Three Principles of the People must cultivate talents who understand modern culture and integrate them, so that their thoughts and actions are concentrated on the position of the Three Principles of the People. For the basic social sciences and natural sciences required for national construction, social construction, and material construction, we should study the essence of the theory and focus on the knowledge and skills of production technology in order to create the cultural value of the Three Principles of the People and complete material construction, and cultivate the spirit of hard work and the ability to lead the masses.</p>
<p>(B) Tempering of the Three Principles of the People: The education of the Three Principles of the People cannot be effective simply by promoting the name of the Three Principles of the People, nor can it be accomplished in universities simply by adding a course in Party ideology. All environmental facilities and the entire physical and mental aspects of students must be consistently instilled with the spirit of education of the Three Principles of the People. All sciences should radiate with the Three Principles of the People as the center, and conclude with the function of the Three Principles of the People being present everywhere. Only then can we achieve the independence of the national spirit, the universality of the implementation of civil rights, and the purpose of promoting the people's livelihood. As for the purpose and implementation guidelines of education in the Republic of China, they have been clearly defined by the Third National Congress of the Kuomintang of China, and their detailed planning for implementation has also been carefully reviewed by the Central Executive Committee. The objectives of higher education are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Students should truly understand the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People and have practical scientific knowledge and skills so as to realize the mission of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>2.  Schools should give full play to the functions of academic institutions so as to become cultural centers.</p>
<p>3.  The curriculum should be based on the needs of national construction so as to achieve the effect of storing materials for the country.</p>
<p>4.  Training should be centered on the Three Principles of the People to cultivate a personality with comprehensive moral, intellectual, physical, aesthetic, and group qualities.</p>
<p>5.  Equipment should be as complete as possible and related to curriculum training. According to the above objectives, how should the principles of university education be implemented and equipped to temper talents of the Three Principles of the People? The principles stipulated by the central government can be used as a guideline.</p>
<h3 id="e91">One Kind of Contradictory Phenomenon in the Voice of National Salvation (Continued from yesterday) Hai Factory <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Some people say that wearing Western suits is a requirement of the times and can make foreigners aware of our cultural progress and look up to us. Is this true? Li Hongzhang-style diplomats, dragging their queues to foreign countries, versus the current diplomats in beautiful Western suits, which ones are really respected by foreigners? Perhaps this is a difference of eras, and there's no need to discuss it. Let's look at the recent example of Gandhi. He goes to England, a country that values the "gentlemanly" spirit and etiquette the most, with only a loincloth and a shawl of homespun cloth, yet he can stand on equal footing and interact with people in grand attire in the resplendent conference room of St. James's Palace. From the King to the common people, everyone respects him very much. I ask, have Chinese diplomats in Western suits ever received such respect from England? India is a conquered nation, having lost all freedom. Gandhi wants to restore India, and he does so simply by wearing homespun cloth and not using British goods. This method has left the British at a loss. China is not yet a conquered nation, and it is so easy to implement the use of domestic goods. I dare say that what Japan and all imperialists fear is Gandhi-style boycott, not slogans and posters. I think that if the Kuomintang did not just shout empty slogans of "Down with Imperialism" but instead strictly ordered all party members and officials at all levels to wear domestic goods, it would be enough to make the imperialists take notice. The oppression and aggression of imperialists against our country are increasing day by day, and the number of Chinese people wearing Western suits is also increasing day by day, especially after the establishment of the Nanjing government, which is directly proportional. This time, when the Japanese invaded Shenyang, they specially abused and killed Chinese people wearing Western suits. Some people were lucky enough to escape by disguising themselves as farmers. From this, can it be said that wearing Western suits can really make foreigners look up to us?</p>
<p>I am not like a stubborn old gentleman, absolutely advocating the preservation of long gowns and mandarin jackets, saying that Western suits are the clothing of barbarians. If China could supply all the materials for Western suits in the future, I would also very much support everyone wearing Western suits, but we can't talk about that now. What material used for Western suits now is not from abroad? The Japanese widely began to wear Western suits only after their country could manufacture the materials for them, which is different from the backbone of the Chinese. In this world, only those who truly love their country can be respected by foreigners. Gandhi is a good example. People who say they love their country but use foreign goods all over their bodies are not truly patriotic. Only those who are looked down upon by foreigners have anything beautiful to say, or have any chance to show off? Foreign goods in China have already permeated everywhere like mercury. Besides clothing materials, there are certainly many foreign goods that Chinese people do not need to use but insist on using. However, clothing is essential to life and has the greatest consumption, so we must pay attention to it first. Male and female students, do you want to save the country? Please do not use foreign-made clothing. Teachers, do you want to save the country? Please do not wear foreign-made clothing for students to see. This is something that patriotic comrades must do and is the easiest thing to do. If this small expression of genuine patriotism cannot be done, is not willing to be done, or is not willing to be done thoroughly, then please do not put up posters, do not shout slogans, do not strike and demonstrate, do not send telegrams, do not go to Beijing to petition. Everyone should just wait sloppily to become slaves of a conquered nation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Students From Various Universities Return to Shanghai Completely at One O'Clock This Morning After Demonstrating in Beijing <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲ A total of more than 2,200 students arrived</p>
<p>▲ No general demonstration held in Beijing</p>
<p>▲ Wensheng holds a meeting to mourn the dead</p>
<p>More than 6,000 students from various universities in this city organized a demonstration delegation to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing successively on the 14th and 15th, they originally planned to join students from Beijing, Tianjin, and other places to hold a general demonstration yesterday and a large parade on the 17th. However, since the 17th, when a part of the students clashed with the military police, the demonstration delegations from Tianjin and other places were urged by the army to return to their original places of origin yesterday. The Shanghai demonstration delegation to Beijing took a special train from Beijing Railway Station to Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and arrived in port completely at 1:00 a.m. this morning. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ Military Police Guard: According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the demonstration delegations from various places clashed with the military police in Beijing the day before yesterday, the Beijing Garrison Command immediately alerted the Central University. The schools were where the demonstration delegations from various places resided. At that time, a small number of personnel from the Tianjin demonstration delegation were forced to return to Tianjin. By yesterday morning, the security was even stricter, and the military police went to the Central University to persuade the students to return immediately. At that time, the students from Jinan were escorted back to Jinan. Students from Anhui, Suzhou, and other places also returned to their hometowns one after another. The students from Shanghai were able to leave only at 4:00 p.m. A special train was dispatched from the railway station, and the army sent them to the station and ordered them to board the train immediately. The general demonstration that students from various places had planned to hold in Beijing yesterday was thus disbanded.</p>
<p>▲ Number of Returnees: The number of returnees is estimated as follows: 300 from Tongji, more than 30 from Tongji Supervisor College, 100 from the Medical School of Central University, more than 10 from the Business School of Central University, more than 100 from Chizhi, more than 50 from Guanghua, 200 from Fudan and its affiliated middle school, more than 50 from Jinan, more than 30 from Wenhua, more than 60 from Southeast Medical School, more than 200 from Dongya, more than 50 from Jiangnan, 20 from Liangjiang, 20 from Wensheng, 50 from Law School, more than 100 from Jiaotong University, and hundreds from the French Institute of Technology, the Central Public School, Shanghai Middle School, and Pudong Middle School, totaling about 2,200 to 2,300 people.</p>
<p>▲ Mourning the Dead: Yang Tongheng (erroneously written as Yang Tongheng), courtesy name Xintian, a student from Wensheng Higher English School who was killed in Beijing this time, was from Xuanzhang County, Sichuan. He graduated from the county middle school and worked as a teacher at a primary school in Daxian County. He wanted to specialize in English, so he came to Shanghai and entered the third year of Wensheng. His family is currently in Sichuan and has not yet been informed. Yesterday, the school held an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. Because Yang was very diligent at school, a memorial service will be held to mourn the deceased.</p>
<p>▲ Xiamen University Arrives in Shanghai: Xiamen University also organized a delegation to Beijing to petition the government. They arrived in Shanghai on the 16th on the Gongping ship to go to Beijing. It is now possible to reach Shanghai. However, since the capital has suffered this change, the students from the university are afraid that they will not go to Nanjing after arriving in Shanghai and will return to Xiamen immediately. (Xin Sheng News Agency)</p>
<p>Another report: More than 1,800 middle and high school students in this city have left Beijing in batches yesterday to return to Shanghai.

<h3 id="e100">Donghua vs. British Navy in Group A Match <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>| 3:00 p.m. at the China Baseball Field |</p>
<p>▲ Lehua vs. Lincoln at Yiyuan</p>
<p>Today at 3:00 p.m., Donghua will play the Navy at the China Baseball Field for the British Group A round-robin match. The referee is Earl Bertot. Donghua has been in high spirits recently and has made rapid progress, vaguely holding the ambition to dominate Shanghai. Sun Enjing rushed over from Tianjin, strengthening the military's momentum, but his ball skills have been rusty for a long time. Without more training, he cannot recover his former glory. According to experts, Tu Kaiyuan's center cannot be attacked at will and seems to require a change in strategy. In the future, Sun Sijing and Chen Pu will undoubtedly be the left and right assistants. Chen Jiaqiu, who is capable both inside and out, can participate as a forward. The lineup today is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Li Ning Guan Xun'an Chen Pu Tu Kaiyuan Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong Li Yichen Dai Linjing Hong Guang Chen Yutian</p>
<p>At the same time on the same day, Lehua will play Lincoln at Yiyuan for the Group A round-robin match. The referee is Camusher. Lehua suddenly rose up last week and actually drew with Donghua. It is unknown whether they can still display their brave defense today against foreign teams.</p>

<p>The St. John's University basketball team fought hard for 40 minutes last night but still lost to the US Navy McReynolds. West Green's hopes were dealt another blow. McReynolds, on the other hand, won seven out of seven, showing the spirit of a champion. The high expectations of last night's game ended in disappointment, and there was a lot of frustration in the cheers.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end, McReynolds dominated. They took the lead with a score of 3-0 at the start, and the closest score was 6-5. After that, the difference was always between 5 and 7 points. In the end, St. John's could not maintain it and could not recover. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Berto.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Jiangsu Elders' Proposals Regarding the Issuance of Public Bonds <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲ Pay Attention to Three Points</p>
<p>Jiangsu elders Ma Liang and others issued a joint letter stating: To the national financial community and the people of the entire country: The Nationalist Party has ruled the country with party governance for five years. The impact and extent of its policies on morality and culture are universally seen and heard, and there is no room for concealment. Regarding national finance alone, apart from land taxes, customs duties, salt surplus taxes, unified taxes, and all kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes extracted to the utmost, the public bonds issued during these five years, excluding those already repaid, amount to more than 1.1 billion yuan in principal and interest. The use of this huge amount of public bonds has not only failed to contribute to any national construction, but has also failed to benefit tens of millions of disaster victims. Instead, it has been used to instigate civil wars, devastate lives, support dictatorship, eliminate dissidents, suppress public opinion, and deprive freedom, leading to a situation where people are brave in internal struggles but cowardly in public defense. The vast territory of China is shrinking by the day, and the country is in imminent danger, with the people suffering terribly. Alas, who is responsible for this, and how did it come to this? If not for the economic support, how could the country be driven to the brink of ruin? This is something that our national financial community and all compatriots should deeply reflect upon after suffering pain. Each time public bonds are issued, the financial community, intimidated by oppressive power, acts as an agent for sale, which is understandable. However, they are greedy for immediate gains and fail to investigate the purpose of the bonds, recklessly absorbing them without imposing restrictions. The facts are clear, and there is no denying it. As for the Chinese people who subscribe to public bonds, they are preoccupied with profit and neglect everything else. Due to the lack of transparency in financial matters, the amount of bonds is never questioned, until financial stagnation and panic in all industries awakens them, which is also pitiable. It is found that most of these 1.1 billion yuan in public bonds are issued in the corner of Shanghai, and the vast majority are scattered among the people of Jiangsu province. This is the capital earned with the sweat and blood of the people, and it is vital to the nation's lifeline. If public and private finances collapse, and the overall situation is shaken, the consequences would be unimaginable. We are concerned with protecting the rights of public bond holders, rescuing the national economy as a whole, learning from past mistakes, and thinking anxiously. Faced with foreign aggression and the reorganization of the political situation, we dare to offer our sincere request to the national financial community and the people of the entire country to pay attention to three things: (1) After this government reorganization, no matter who forms the new government, it must quickly establish a formal people's political participation mechanism, implement a budget and final account system, and ensure financial transparency. Even if new public bonds are issued within the budget scope, the reasons, quantities, and uses for the issuance must be clearly explained. Otherwise, our financial community and the people of the entire country vow not to subscribe. (2) After this government reorganization, no matter who forms the new government, it must formally recognize all public bonds issued by the previous government, with principal and interest handled according to the original terms. Before the old public bonds are formally recognized by the new government, refuse to sell any new public bonds under any name. (3) From now on, our national financial community and the people of the entire country should not only pay attention to supervising the issuance of domestic public bonds, but also expose and formally reject any attempts by foreign powers to issue large-scale international public bonds under false pretenses, sacrificing national sovereignty, to cut off the source of the government's sins. Do not repeat the previous mistakes of indifference and tolerance. The way to save ourselves and the country lies in this. Our national financial community and the people of the entire country, having experienced such deep pain, must fundamentally change our approach, implement supervision of government powers, so that politics can quickly get on track, end the various disputes of the past twenty years, and create a new life for the Republic of China. Survival is at stake at this critical juncture. We respectfully present our humble opinion, hoping for your public consideration. Ma Liang, Zhao Fengchang, Shen Enfu, Zhang Yijun, Xun Kang, Li Genyuan, Huang Yanpei, Mu Xiangyue, Zhu Shaowen, Leng, Jia Fengzhen, Zhao Ping, Yuan Xiluo, Lu Guiliang, et al., of the Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Dispute Occurred at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Merchants' Movement Committee Sent Personnel to Take Over</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai Refused to Hand Over</p>
<p>▲ 160 Trade Associations Issued a Declaration</p>
<p>New Voice News reports: The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants' Movement Committee dispatched a large number of personnel to take over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge yesterday afternoon, creating a rather serious situation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Defense Corps were ordered to send police to protect the site. Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce replied that the Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization and cannot be handed over without legal grounds, resulting in the failure of the takeover. At the same time, 160 trade associations in the city also expressed their opposition. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Situation at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Disturbance: After 12 noon yesterday, Zhang Zilian led dozens of people who sneaked into the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They were dressed sloppily, in plain clothes and short outfits, looking quite disreputable. They all carried a symbol on them, a card with the red seal of the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants' Movement Committee and a number for identification. After the crowd arrived at the Chamber of Commerce, they went to various offices, creating disturbances and intending to cause trouble. Seeing these plainclothes people inside, the Chamber of Commerce realized that their presence would affect the operations, so they separately reported to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting protection. Around 1 pm, police officers from the Public Security Bureau and members of the Defense Corps arrived one after another and drove the plainclothes people out of the Chamber of Commerce, so that the Chamber of Commerce members could resume their normal work.</p>
<p>▲ Authorities Prevented Takeover: After receiving the report, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, sent officials Chen Zeyi and Hu Yuqi to investigate and report to the Municipal Government. He also notified Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, that he was not allowed to hand over the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Corps and Police Protection: After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reported to the Municipal Government and requested protection, Acting Mayor Secretary-General Yu Hongjun immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect the site. Acting Director Wang Yuwen ordered Lu Ying, Captain of the Detective Team, together with Sun Mou, Captain of the Sixth Squad of the Police Brigade, and 36 armed police officers, to go to protect the site. The Municipal Defense Corps was also ordered to dispatch the First Defense Post of the Eighth Team stationed in Tanziwan, led by platoon leader Li Shouhai and 40 armed members, to protect the site.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Statement: Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, arrived at the Chamber of Commerce at 2 pm and learned of the situation. At that time, Zhao Nangong from the Organizing Department of the so-called Merchants' Movement Committee was also at the Chamber of Commerce. The chairman met with them, and Zhao handed over the official letter from the Merchants' Movement Committee to send personnel to take over. Wang Xiaolai immediately stated sternly that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was established in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law. This Chamber of Commerce Law was passed by Mr. Hu Zhantang when he was the speaker of the Legislative Yuan and was formally promulgated by the National Government. He was elected as the chairman and was legally elected. Only by following the law can the handover be carried out. What is called legal handover is that after the term of office expires, a general meeting of members is convened to re-elect in accordance with the regulations, or the competent authority provides guidance. To go a step further, if the members ask the committee to resign before the term of office expires, there must be sufficient reasons and procedures stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce Law. Otherwise, he can also ask the court to legally protect his position. Therefore, he naturally cannot accept this request. If force is used to coerce him, he will not be afraid. However, the government has the responsibility to maintain law and order, and he will report to the authorities for handling. Moreover, he has no knowledge of who commissioned the so-called Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants' Movement Committee, so how can he rashly hand over the Chamber of Commerce? Now that Beijing and Guangdong are united, all issues will be collectively resolved by the Fourth Central Committee. He is deeply puzzled by the sudden occurrence of this dispute. Zhao left angrily when Wang refused to hand over the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Standing Committee Members' Remarks: Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Xu Jiqi, and Yuan Ludeng, members of the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, issued a joint statement yesterday, saying that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization organized in accordance with the law, and they were elected as members of the Standing Committee in accordance with the law, so they cannot relinquish their positions unless it is in accordance with the law. This is a very clear principle. Important cases of the Chamber of Commerce must be resolved by the Executive and Supervisory Committee, and its foundation lies in the various trade associations. Their advancement or retreat follows the laws and regulations on the one hand and obeys public opinion on the other. As long as they are in office, they will do their duty and will not be afraid.</p>
<p>▲ Telegraph to the Municipal Government: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: To the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau: At about 12 noon today, dozens of plainclothes people suddenly came to the Chamber of Commerce, claiming to take over, with a threatening posture, obstructing the work of the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce was established on June 22, 1929, in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the National Government. The current Executive and Supervisory Committee were also legally elected by the general meeting of members on that day and reported to the competent authorities. Now, some plainclothes people are falsely claiming a name and attempting to seize the Chamber of Commerce by force, which not only violates national laws and regulations, but also affects social order. If this is not thoroughly investigated, how can laws and regulations be maintained and organizations be respected? Therefore, we specially report the situation in a telegram, respectfully requesting your government and bureau to investigate and stop it, and order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send police to maintain order, so that we can work smoothly. We are looking forward to it. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Important Announcement: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an important announcement yesterday, stating: Our Chamber of Commerce was formally established on June 22, 1929, in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the National Government. The current Executive and Supervisory Committee members are entrusted with the responsibility of managing the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce by all members, and we respect the law. Except for holding re-elections after the term of office of the committee members expires in accordance with the law or following the guidance of the competent authorities, we will not accept any interference in the actions of our Chamber of Commerce from any other individual or organization under any name. Even if force is used to coerce us, we will resolutely reject it. This is a special declaration, hoping that all trade associations in the city and the merchants in the city will take note.</p>
<p>▲ Convene a Meeting: The Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee at 5 pm yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Xu Jiqi, Yuan Ludeng, and others attended. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xiaolai. First, the chairman reported on the various situations of the day, and then a unanimous resolution was made to convene an emergency joint meeting of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee to discuss the countermeasures.</p>
<p>▲ Normal Work: After the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to the Chamber of Commerce to maintain order and completely drove out the plainclothes team, all departments resumed work immediately, everything returned to normal, and all order was restored.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Qiaqing's Remarks: Yu Qiaqing of the Shipping Association made remarks on this matter yesterday, saying that the Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization of merchants. Its real basic members are the various trade associations. The affairs of the Chamber of Commerce should be resolved by a majority vote of the representatives of various industries. All merchants should unite in unity within the scope of the law. This unfortunate incident in the Chamber of Commerce is considered a violation of the law by a very small number of people, destroying the entire merchant community, which is very painful and should be absolutely stopped. We hope that all legitimate merchants in the city will recognize this.</p>
<p>▲ Situation on the Side of the Merchants' Movement Committee</p>
<p>▲ Committee Established: The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants' Movement Committee, after being ordered to organize, officially started work yesterday. A special office was set up at No. 384 Jiujiang Road, and a notice was issued stating: Our committee has been ordered to organize and has been established. All matters concerning the merchants' movement in this city will be handled by our committee. We hope that all merchants in the city will take note of this. Special announcement, office address: No. 384 Jiujiang Road, telephone: 93567, December 18.</p>
<p>▲ Internal Organization: The internal organization of the committee is divided into four departments: (1) Special Affairs, (2) General Affairs, (3) Organization, and (4) Propaganda. The standing committee members are Feng Shaoshan, Shi Zhikun, Wang Hanliang, and others. The secretary is Chen Zhiying.</p>
<p>▲ Take Over the Chamber of Commerce: After the Merchants' Movement Committee officially started work, it was resolved to send Zhao Nangong, Director of the Organization Department, Liu Musu, Director of the Special Affairs Department, and Chen Zhiying, the secretary, to Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to take over, and Zhang Zi led the plainclothes team, each with a symbol, to handle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Chamber of Commerce: The Merchants' Movement Committee sent personnel to take over the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, holding an official letter stating: Dear Sir, The Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce was disrupted and forcibly occupied by the Shanghai Municipal Party Department in April 1929, and then illegally reorganized by the Nanjing Central Party Department, destroying the merchants' movement and violating the true spirit of democratic politics. For three years, the will of the merchants in the city has not been able to express itself, and the suffering is beyond words. Our committee is a group to promote the merchants' movement. In accordance with the central government's order, the meaning of organizing and establishing the committee is that it is necessary to restore the Shanghai Special Municipality General Chamber of Commerce. After discussion and resolution, Zhao Nangong, Director of the Organization Department, Liu Musu, Director of the Special Affairs Department, and Chen Zhiying, the secretary, were sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to take over. Except for the letter, we hereby inform you that you should handle it in accordance with the investigation and immediately hand over the seals, documents, and other items to the aforementioned personnel for clear receipt. This is very important. To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants' Movement Committee.</p>
<p>▲ Takeover Failed: After 12 noon, Zhang Zilian led the team to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce first, and then Chen Zhiying, Liu Musu, Sun Choucheng, and others went to notify the staff of the Chamber of Commerce, explaining the reasons for the takeover, and instructed them to work with peace of mind. Later, Standing Committee Member Wang Hanliang and Organization Director Zhao Nangong also arrived and met with Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce one after another. Because Wang refused to hand over the Chamber of Commerce, they withdrew at about 4 pm.</p>
<p>▲ Attitude of the Trade Associations</p>
<p>▲ Issued a Declaration: An important declaration of the 160 trade associations in this city states: This morning, we heard that a plainclothes team of ten people went to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, claiming to take over, which is extremely shocking. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was established in accordance with the provisions of the Chamber of Commerce Law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. On June 22, 1929, a general meeting of members was held to elect the Executive and Supervisory Committee and was formally established. In accordance with the law, except for re-elections after the term of office of the committee members expires or guidance from the local competent authority, any individual or organization cannot illegally interfere in the actions of the Chamber of Commerce under any name. If there is any improper action in the Chamber of Commerce, it should be corrected in accordance with legal procedures, which the plainclothes team cannot intervene. We do not know what law the plainclothes team is based on and what qualifications they have to lead a crowd and hope to occupy the Chamber of Commerce by force, which is extremely hateful. If the legally produced leadership organs of merchants and the people can be seized by a few people by force, where will the national laws and social order be placed? Our associations hereby solemnly declare that we absolutely support all members of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce legally produced to exercise their duties as usual, and not to be intimidated by violence.

<h3 id="e111">Losses of Japanese Ships in China After Economic Severance <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Ships Idle for 900,000 Tons in Three Months</p>
<p>▲ Business Losses of More Than 64 Million</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, China has unanimously severed economic ties with Japan. The commercial losses suffered by Japan in China in these three months are greater than those of any previous boycott. The shipping companies have suffered the most. Whether it is the Yangtze River, inland rivers, ocean-going, or coastal shipping, Chinese merchants and passengers generally do not use Japanese ships, which can be said to be a complete break in trade. The losses of Japanese ships since the boycott have been detailedly investigated by reporters, and the accurate figures and their current operations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Number of Ships Remaining on Route: This time, the severance of economic relations with Japan is carried out unanimously from top to bottom throughout the country, which is different from previous boycotts. In October, Japanese ships on all routes in the sea and river stopped service due to zero business. Up to now, only four ships remain on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The 12 ships of the Kinai Shipping Company that specialize in Japan to Wuhu, Daye, Hankou, and other ports to transport steel and rapeseed have also stopped nine ships. The North and South Ocean routes along the coast, which used to have 70 to 80 Japanese ships, now have only 12 ships left. However, there is no cargo to transport and no passengers to carry. Most of them have to maintain their shipping rights because the Japanese government has subsidies. In terms of the situation, the Japanese ships in China today are only eking out a living.</p>
<p>▲ Losses of Various Shipping Companies: The Japan Shipowners' Association has investigated the operation of Japanese ships in China since September 18th. Counting to today, it has been exactly three months. During these three months, the three companies of Nisshin, Osaka, and Nittai Shipping, which have a large influence on the shipping industry in China, suffered the heaviest losses. From September 20th to December 14th, the three shipping companies suffered a total loss of 18,020,000 yen due to the impact of the economic severance. Due to the decline in the pound price, the companies lost another 8,640,000 yen, for a total loss of 26,660,000 yen.</p>
<p>▲ Losses of Ships Outside the Company: In addition to the above-mentioned three companies, there are also Kawasaki, Yamashita, Dalian, International, Mitsui, Sato, and Awa, Sawayama, Kyodo, Towa, and other Japanese companies that operate ships in China. The people of Shanghai call them "wild chicken ships," which usually travel to various ports in the North and South Oceans of our country. From September 20th to today, the business losses suffered by these ships outside the company due to the boycott and suspension of services are estimated at 37,800,000 yen.</p>
<p>▲ Surplus Tonnage: According to investigations by the Japan Shipowners' Association and the Seamen's Union, since the Manchurian Incident, due to the Chinese boycott of Japanese ships, the Japanese merchant ships that have been suspended in the first and second districts of the coastal routes (including the waterways in China, the North and South Oceans, the Yangtze River, and Korea) have reached 700,000 tons, and there is no way to dispatch them. The Pacific route in the ocean-going route has also been affected and 170,000 tons of ships have been idled. Due to the intense anti-Japanese sentiment of the overseas Chinese in the South Pacific Islands and Australia, 120,000 tons have also been suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Ma Xiangbo's Tearful Appeal to the Youth <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The youth of the entire nation, alarmed by the rampant Japanese invaders, the collapse of justice, and the imminent peril of national demise, have spontaneously risen up to engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation. Some have vowed to donate to General Ma Zhanshan, others have organized anti-Japanese support groups, still others have severed fingers or even resorted to suicide to awaken the people. Their courage is soaring and admirable. Upon hearing of this, this old man cannot help but feel admiration and respect, but I must sigh and say that today's affairs cannot be accomplished with mere passion. It is of little help to the nation. Saving the nation lies in practical struggle, especially in effective practical struggle. What is meant by effective practical struggle? The violent Japanese expose their imperialist ambitions, wielding their cannons and guns to forcibly occupy our land, slaughter our people, and seize our wealth. Their extreme greed can truly be described as the actions of robbers and communists. In essence, they can be regarded as international bandits. Why do I say this? Today's communism only shares wealth and goods, but Japan goes further by sharing people's land. Today's communists only share wealth and do not harm others' lives, but Japan not only forcibly occupies our land but also treats our men, women, old, and young as if they were mere grass, taking pleasure in slaughter. They spare no expense in staging extremely cruel tragedies everywhere with gunfire and cannons. This kind of banditry is exhibited by a nation and a country, so it is not inappropriate for us to call Japan an international bandit. Therefore, for our country to deal with this international bandit who is approaching step by step and entering our house, the question is not whether to fight or not, but how to fight and how to achieve effectiveness. This international bandit wields a strong army, navy, and air force to bully our weak country with its impoverished people and depleted resources. Although we have decided to resist, our military equipment and food supplies all depend on other countries. Resistance is not easy. In other words, rashly engaging in war is not a wise strategy. Therefore, how to struggle, how to make the struggle practical and effective, is truly the most urgent and serious problem that needs to be solved. Today, the only way for our country to save itself is not to seek help and pity from the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, from September 18th to today, more than eighty days have passed. What has been the result of seeking help and pity? The League of Nations is essentially the same as Japan, sharing the same odor and substance. Seeing the Japanese seize our Northeast, with its beautiful mountains and rivers and abundant resources, their index fingers have long been twitching, and they have long harbored plans to dip their fingers in the pot and take a share. Seeking skin from a tiger and asking for justice from the powerful is truly the greatest foolishness in the world. It is only enough to humiliate ourselves and invite disaster. Not seeking self-help but seeking help from others to侥幸establish a nation is a symbol of national demise and a truly heartbreaking phenomenon. Young people, what you are doing today is nothing more than petitioning in Nanjing or joining the army in the Northeast. Is this kind of work truly practical struggle? Is it truly effective practical struggle? Have you young people ever calmly considered this question? The country raises an army of more than two million, spending more than 80% of the national treasury. Since the founding of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent, and the tragedy of fratricide has been staged every day. However, when foreign aggression suddenly arrives, they retreat at the mere sight of the enemy. Within a day, half of the Northeast is lost to the enemy. At home, they only talk about鎮静 and sing about non-resistance. Abroad, they only beg and plead with the League of Nations, a puppet organization, presenting petitions and appeals, revealing their predicament. Students go to Beijing to petition, once, twice, and again, arriving and returning in an endless stream. Aside from hearing the usual "The central government is already prepared and has made a final resolution. The people should trust the government and support the government's teachings," the lost territory in the Northeast remains lost, the Japanese invaders remain rampant, and the internal divisions and conflicts remain the same. The government's inability to send troops, its lack of time to send troops, and its lack of resolve to send troops are obvious facts. The young people's arduous petitions and tearful pleas, even if they shed all their tears and then shed blood, and even if they die, are futile and of no benefit. Furthermore, General Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated army in a remote area, resists the strong and unyielding. Like strong wind revealing the strong grass, his righteousness is awe-inspiring. This responsible soldier is truly someone we should love, respect and support. However, our responsibility today is not only to save Ma Zhanshan but to save our entire country and our entire nation. Therefore, instead of merely admiring Ma Zhanshan, we should all rise up and strive to be like Ma Zhanshan, so that everyone is Ma Zhanshan. Moreover, along our coast and rivers, the violent Japanese warships are already densely deployed, and vagrant bandits are everywhere. They can fabricate pretexts and plant disasters to ignite the September 18th Incident at any time and place. Then, do we wait until it is lost before recovering it, or do we take advantage of the fact that it has not yet been occupied and properly preserve it? Therefore, today we should unite under the unified action of resisting violence and saving ourselves, and make preparations in advance. This old man believes that the most important strategy for saving the country today is to imitate the ancient system and implement the Baojia system. Ten families are united as one Jia, ten Jia as one Zhongjia, ten Zhongjia as one Dajia, ten Dajia as one Tuan, and ten Tuan as one Zhongguo, then Zhongguo becomes one Datuan. By expanding this, we can first create a population and household register, emulate the organization of the army, make actions unified, command swift, connections close, and will firm, lead it with non-cooperation with Japan, or economic severance with Japan, or even with a desperate battle with Japan. The Japanese criticize our national character, often calling it scattered sand. We should now use our greatest efforts to turn the scattered sand into strong cement. This old man says this, and I know that it is difficult to implement, but today the country is in danger and the situation is urgent, and we have no other choice. But if we use the spirit of going to Beijing to petition to engage in going to the countryside to awaken the masses, and use the determination of trekking long distances to the Northeast to support Ma Zhanshan to engage in organizing the masses, then gather the manpower and financial resources of hundreds of thousands of families, unite millions of people as one heart, and make them brave and knowledgeable, then what do we have to fear from the current national crisis, what do we have to fear from the invasion of the violent Japanese? Saving our country and renewing our nation all lie in this. This old man is old. Looking around at the mountains and rivers, I feel infinite emotion. I hate myself for being old and weak and unable to repay the country. Therefore, I have high hopes for my young students. This old man deeply believes that the country is based on the people. Without responsible citizens, the country will not be able to stand. At the same time, I deeply believe that self-help is the only way to save oneself. Only self-help can overcome the current difficulties. Seeking help from others and begging for pity from others are all futile. Youth is the backbone of society and the pillar of the country in the future. I hope you will work together with one heart and one mind to make arduous but effective struggles.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Women's Temperance Union's Letter to Students Nationwide <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Urging an immediate return to school to concentrate on studies</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Union believes that during this time of national crisis, students' strikes and demonstrations, although stemming from patriotic enthusiasm, not only do not help the situation but also harm public order, disturb people's hearts, and provide the enemy with opportunities for aggression. Therefore, it has specifically written to students nationwide, asking them to immediately return to school to study and not engage in such passive actions again, to maintain their initial anti-Japanese intentions, and not to be used by others. The original letter is as follows: To the students of the entire nation, greetings. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, the government has been unable to cope with the Japanese invaders' inching forward, and there is a hidden pain of national subjugation. Compatriots at home, all those with blood in their veins, are filled with righteous indignation and vow not to coexist with the Japanese invaders. Our boycott of Japanese goods, with this determination, can already be fatal to Japan. Women's organizations such as the National Salvation Alliance and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association have stood on the front lines to ensure internal stability before resisting foreign aggression, striving for national unity. Male students intensifying military training and female students learning first aid for wounded soldiers are the best ways for young students to save the country. However, recently, students across the country have gathered in Beijing to petition, obstructing traffic, destroying property, and injuring people, refusing to listen to advice. If this continues, it will be unimaginable. Your nightly sacrifices are driven by patriotic enthusiasm, but it is a pity that it is being used improperly and can harm the country's lifeline. Our association has always been engaged in family reform to consolidate the foundation of the country, but we dare not fail to express our views in this time of crisis. (1) In this time of national hardship, the government should devote all its efforts to foreign affairs. If students petition in Beijing, although it shows popular enthusiasm and serves as a backing for diplomacy, the large number of people traveling back and forth not only reduces the government's power in foreign affairs but also seems out of place in the eyes of other countries governed by law. (2) Students are outstanding talents of the country, and their every move can affect the future of the nation. Assaults and riots, although committed by a minority, cause disappointment among the people and have a negative impact on the character of all students. (3) The biggest reason for China's current political corruption is the lack of outstanding leaders in internal affairs. The current authorities were not students in the past? Therefore, the key task for young people to save the country today is to intensify their studies and prepare solid knowledge to serve the country in the future. (4) The Sino-Japanese dispute, whether resolved by force or diplomacy, cannot be resolved in a short time. Students should urge the government and unite with the authorities to face the national crisis together, enduring hardship and striving for a long-term struggle. Our association is the only maternal organization that strives for internal unity. We know that our words are harsh and difficult to gain sympathy, but every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, and we have no choice but to express our heartfelt feelings. We earnestly ask you to consider our words carefully and hope that you will immediately return to school to concentrate on your studies, use your spare time to engage in patriotic activities, and not go on strike or demonstrate again, so as to prevent China from being in a state of anarchy. We humbly ask for your understanding and forgiveness for our presumptuousness. Printed by Wang Liming, Chief Director of the Chinese Women's Temperance Union.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Italian Postal Company's Fastest Liner to China <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲ Can reach Italy in 24 days</p>
<p>▲ Breaks all previous sailing records</p>
<p>▲ The fastest mail ship in the Far East</p>
<p>This year's competition among ocean liners is fierce. Major shipping companies are building ships with increased speed. Ordinary steamships with a speed of 13 or 14 nautical miles per hour are gradually being eliminated by the process of natural selection. In the Pacific this year, since the completion of the two giant liners, the Hoover and Coolidge from the United States, the speed of mail ships or cargo ships currently operating between the United States and China is around 19 to 20 nautical miles. On the European route, British and French postal services have also switched to newly built fast liners, trying their best to shorten the sailing time and save economic time. This is necessary to compete. Now, on the Sino-Italian route, there is an unprecedentedly fast mail ship sailing to Shanghai, breaking all nautical records and truly opening a new era in the Sino-Italian shipping industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Italian Postal Service Improves Passenger Liners The Italian Postal Company in Shanghai is boldly renovating its shipping business between China and Italy this year, dividing passenger and cargo ships into two categories. Four ships, including the Pilosna and Krakofu Quqi, are specially designated to carry passengers and are listed as official mail ships on the Sino-Italian route. Two other ships are specifically assigned to carry cargo. Passenger and cargo ships are scheduled to operate once a month, traveling between Shanghai and Qu Li in Italy. Only this Italian shipping company operates in Shanghai, so business is still good.</p>
<p>▲ Additional Special Fast New Ships Currently, after the British C-class new ships began operating on the European routes from Shanghai, the fastest time to reach London is 32 or 33 days, and other ships take 36 or 37 days. The four new passenger liners newly dispatched by the Italian Postal Company this year also take 33 or 34 days to reach Italy from Shanghai. Now, the company's newly built special fast giant liner, the Conte Roseo, has been completed. The ship has a load capacity of 17,240 tons and is dedicated to passengers, so it is equipped with first, second, and third class cabins, with excellent layout. The fuel is oil and the horsepower is very large. The speed per hour can be more than 20 nautical miles. It has been assigned to operate on the Sino-Italian route.</p>
<p>▲ Breaks Nautical Records According to the company, the new Conte Roseo is scheduled to depart from Italy in late January and will arrive in Shanghai in February. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on its first voyage to Italy on March 11. The ship's huge power and fast speed make it the unprecedented first ship on the Far East-Europe route. From Shanghai to Italy, via Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Red Sea, via Levant Brindisi Venice Priest, it only takes 24 days to reach. After the ship is put into operation, this Sino-European sea route can be shortened by one-third.</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Emergency Relief Association Writes to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Aid to Disaster-Stricken Overseas Chinese in Siam <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that according to reports, the Chinese community in the Bangkok area of Siam suddenly suffered a major fire, and the number of overseas Chinese who were homeless was more than 2,000. Therefore, it specifically requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to raise funds for relief. The original letter stated: Respectfully, according to our investigation, since the establishment of our association, we have repeatedly received remittances from overseas Chinese in Siam through your chamber, including three batches from the Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce totaling 121,167 yuan, 1,000 yuan from the Wan Yi Public Bureau, and 1,558 yuan and 9 jiao and 1 fen from the Mingde School. Remembering the motherland and benefiting the disaster-stricken compatriots, all Chinese people deeply admire and respect. Now, reading the Reuters Bangkok dispatch of the 15th, "A major fire in the Chinese area of Siam last night destroyed no less than 500 homes and businesses, with losses of more than 500,000 pounds sterling, and 2,000 people were left homeless," our association remembers the previous donations and is even more sympathetic. Therefore, we specifically send this letter on their behalf, earnestly requesting your chamber to quickly investigate and allocate funds for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Aftermath of the Burning of the Dade Ship <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ Passengers' goods have been completely destroyed</p>
<p>▲ Nine corpses recovered from the Hupu River</p>
<p>▲ Bereaved families will make representations</p>
<p>After the burning of the Dade ship of the Shanghai Dada Company, the company sent the Dayu ship to the scene of the accident with the merchants who had goods on board and various insurance companies to investigate whether there were any remnants of the fire. The ship returned to Shanghai at 12 o'clock the night before last. According to the merchants, the 1,052 pieces of Western-style cotton candy, green licorice and tobacco that they had loaded were completely destroyed. Also, after the Chuheng ship arrived at the scene of the accident, it immediately cooperated with the Chuyuan ship to salvage corpses. Yesterday, the Hupu Post-Disaster Office sent a telegram saying that nine corpses had been recovered from the Hupu River. The company immediately replied by telegram, ordering them to take photos in Hupu, prepare coffins, and collect the corpses, and send the photos to Shanghai for identification. As for the Chuyuan and Chuheng ships, they are continuing to salvage corpses to avoid omissions.</p>
<p>The number of people burned to death and drowned in this accident is more than 120. Currently, there are people whose whereabouts are unknown and whose corpses cannot be found, such as Shen Zhuowu, Xu Yuanzhe, Xu Bingruo, Ge Xudong from Rugao, and Cheng Liu, etc. There are also those who are registered in other counties who are being investigated. Now, the families of the victims, in order to ensure the safety of travel for fellow villagers in Jiangbei, have decided to hold the company responsible for all legal responsibilities based on the company's failure to take precautions beforehand and its negligence in rescue afterward.</p>
<p>Shen Zhuowu's whereabouts are unknown. Upon hearing the news, the Rugao Chamber of Commerce and other groups immediately sent people to investigate along the Jiangbei ports and also sent people to Shanghai to comfort Shen's family and assist in the investigation. They also telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting them to order the water police in each district along the river to pay special attention to the search.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Concession Cannot Be Exempted from the Grain Wharf Donation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ No objection does not mean support</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously approved the Ministry of Finance's document based on the letter from the Flood Relief Committee, requesting exemption from the flood relief grain wharf donation. The matter concerned local revenue and should be approved by your municipal government for exemption. The municipal government has sent letters to the Jianghai Customs Tax Department and the British and French Public Works Bureaus, requesting exemption from the grain wharf donation. It is now heard that the French Municipal Council has replied to the municipal government that it has decided that there is no objection to the exemption of the grain wharf donation. However, the amount of wharf donation that this concession should receive should not be reduced as a result, according to the original agreement in the distribution agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Continued Hearing of the Day and Night Bank Case <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ Selling the Wannian Cemetery</p>
<p>▲ Retaining the Chu Jiu Hospital</p>
<p>The case of the bankruptcy and liquidation of the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department was again summoned yesterday by the Civil Execution Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Weizhen said to the lawyer representing the Huang family, "The Wannian Cemetery under the Huang family's property was mentioned during the last court hearing. I don't know if it can be auctioned. Have the directors discussed it?" Lawyer Tan Yigong replied, "The lawyers for the directors of the Wannian Cemetery have not yet known about it. Please grant an extension so that we can send a letter to urge the conclusion." Then, the lawyer representing the creditors, Yan Luqing, said, "According to our lawyer's speculation, the Wannian Cemetery may be of a business nature and can be sold. The court can clarify the situation by checking the accounts." Judge Wang also said that the court had recently received a letter from a certain public association requesting the purchase of the Huang Chu Jiu Hospital to establish a charitable hospital to help the poor, and the Social Affairs Bureau had also sent a letter expressing its agreement and requesting its retention. What is the opinion of the lawyers representing the creditors? Lawyer Tan Yigong, representing the Huang family, said, "This is a public welfare matter, and the Huang family does not object." Lawyer Yan Luqing, representing the creditors, said, "The Huang Chu Jiu Hospital is one of the Huang family's properties and should be listed for auction. The hospital is small and there are many charitable hospitals in Shanghai. The public association can buy property elsewhere and establish a hospital. Why should it take advantage of the poor creditors?" Lawyer Tan replied, "Even if the auction yields more one or two thousand yuan, each creditor will only get a few dozen copper coins more, which is not a big loss. Retaining this public welfare hospital benefits the people and is a great merit." Judge Wang instructed them to wait for a written reply for review and decision. According to the lawyer representing the creditors, Xu Yannian, "Since the bankruptcy and liquidation of the Gongfa Company, each creditor has only received 20%, and the rest of the money has not been settled. But I don't know what status the liquidator has in relation to Huang's property, whether it is issued by the liquidator or handled separately by the Huang family. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council has previously ruled that Huang's property is subject to provisional attachment. Please pay attention." Judge Wang instructed to check the files for review and decision, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Municipal Health Bureau Bans the Sale of Quinine Pills <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Regulations on the Management of Drug Dealers and the Regulations on the Management of Proprietary Medicines, the Municipal Health Bureau has been following them. In addition to issuing orders to all drug dealers to register in accordance with the regulations, it has also implemented drug inspections in order to prevent unsanitary and substandard drugs. It is now heard that Ke Fa Pharmacy is manufacturing and selling a type of quinine sulfate tablets (ie, quinine pills). The Municipal Health Bureau has verified that each tablet contains 0.006188 grams of cinchona sulfate and 0.07831 grams of cinchona hydrochloride, and does not contain quinine sulfate, which is inconsistent with the label on the bottle.

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a notice to its members yesterday, stating that "Lawyers are entrusted by their clients to handle litigation cases. Except for using the name of an agent to make applications to the court, which must use a complaint, if the application is made to the court solely in the name of a lawyer (such as applying to review files, applying for an extension, applying for a sub-agent, or submitting a defense brief), it is not necessary to use a complaint. Only an application form is required, with a judicial stamp of one jiao. If it is a civil application for an extension or application for a sub-agent, a application fee of seven jiao and five fen must be paid. Because the number of new members is gradually increasing, we are concerned that the aforementioned methods are not well understood, and to prevent disorder, the association has prepared four types of application forms for the sake of uniformity. Each type is priced at three copper coins to cover costs. The forms have been submitted to the Second and Third Branches of the Jiangsu Higher Court and approved by the Ministry of Justice Administration under Instruction No. 17483. All four types of application forms have now been prepared. Therefore, we hereby notify you to check and collect them at your own expense."</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Zhihe Bank Case Proceeds to Reconciliation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Court Initially Grants Postponement for Trial</p>
<p>▲ To Allow Both Parties to Negotiate Everything</p>
<p>Following the collapse of Zhihe Yongji Bank, the First Special District Court appointed accountant Tang Zaizhang to audit the bank's accounts. Tang subsequently discovered that Shen Chengfu, son of the bank's manager Shen Yingxiang, owed a massive sum of over 3.2 million yuan and had fled. If this sum could not be recovered, creditors would face a minimum loss of over 1.2 million yuan. Therefore, a petition was filed with the First Special Court, requesting that the bank's shareholders Shen Qilang, Chen Yizhai, Xu Xieming, Qiu Dingfu, and Chen Rongchu bear the responsibility for the unpaid debts. A trial had already commenced, as previously reported. Shen Chengfu has now been apprehended by the police, and his debt should be dealt with. In recent days, prominent businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai have been mediating. Whether this will be effective remains to be seen. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for the continuation of the case. The defendants' lawyers, Wu Jingxiong, Wang Fuchang, and Zhang Zhirang, requested a postponement to continue reconciliation efforts. Judge Li, considering the complexity of the case and the undesirability of prolonged delays, granted a brief postponement to allow both parties to negotiate everything. If reconciliation proceeds smoothly by the deadline, a further extension may be granted. If it proves difficult, the trial will commence to prevent undue delay under the guise of reconciliation. Both parties' lawyers agreed to this, and Judge Li granted the postponement.</p>

<p>▲ Wen Zhongtian's Good Intentions</p>
<p>▲ Truth Revealed After Questioning</p>
<p>Around 6 PM the day before yesterday, a Chinese constable, number 3031, from the Xinzha Police Station found a man near the Racecourse on North Chengdu Road carrying the corpse of a girl about two years old. Finding his behavior suspicious, the constable took him to the police station for temporary detention. The child's body was transported to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Yesterday, the suspect was transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned the man, who identified himself as Tian Zhongwen, from Suzhou, age 46,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>a small vendor, residing at No. 12, Yangguan Lane, west of the Racecourse. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, he said, "I saw a girl of about two years old abandoned on the ground in the lane, still breathing. I took pity on her. As the orphanage was nearby, I picked her up and took her to the Dagu Road orphanage. However, the orphanage clerk said that someone had brought the child an hour earlier, but they refused her due to her serious illness. Since I was doing a good deed, they suggested taking her to a charitable organization in Zhabei, which would likely accept her. They gave me 300 copper coins to hire a rickshaw. However, I didn't know the way, so when the rickshaw reached Zhabei, I couldn't find a charitable organization, and the driver didn't want to continue. I had to turn back to the concession, and near the Racecourse, I asked the constable where to take the child. The constable, seeing that the child was dead, took me to the police station. I have an elderly mother, wife, three sons, and a daughter at home," and he began to weep uncontrollably. Subsequently, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Tian Zhongwen was a key witness in the case and should be temporarily detained until after the autopsy. Judge Wu instructed that Tian be released after the autopsy. Prosecutor Guo then arrived by car to examine the body, confirming that the girl had died from illness. As no relatives could be found, the Pushan Mountain Villa was ordered to bury her. Tian Zhongwen was released.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Three Suspects in the Zhu Yangshan Family Murder Retract Their Confessions <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Denying Robbery and Murder</p>
<p>At 1 AM on September 19, thieves broke into the home of Zhu Yangshan, a native of Qingpu, at 196 East Xihua Road, stealing valuables worth several thousand yuan and killing Zhu's relative Gu Cao, and a maidservant Zhou Lu. Huishan Police arrested Ma A'er, a rickshaw driver from Tongzhou, based on information from Cai Zhitian. He was handed over to the First Special District Court, tried, and sentenced to death, pending approval from higher authorities. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Detective Xie Shuiquan of Huishan Police and Detective Lu Gengsheng of Diswei Road Police arrested Zhang Xianjun (nicknamed "Little Yellow Hair"), from Tongzhou, and suspects Yang Douchu and Qu Hanming on Fair Road. They also went to Zhang Xianjun's home at No. 8 Tangshan Road and arrested his brother Zhang Xianming, and friends Ji Haikun and Li Helong, a total of six people. Zhang Xianjun, while being led by detectives to identify the scene of the crime at the victim's home, suddenly collapsed, having been injured in the head by handcuffs. He was sent to the police hospital for treatment. The next morning, the police handed over Zhang Xianming and the other five to the First High Court for detention. This was reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, the police determined that Yang, Qu, and Li were not involved and requested their release. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiebin specially convened the Fifth Criminal Court to investigate. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Zhang Xianjun had recovered, and Ma A'er had also submitted a petition from the Western Prison. During the ongoing investigation, it was discovered that Zhang Xianjun and Ji Haikun had committed eight robberies between last month at No. 186 Huishan Road, No. 93 Huade Road, No. 56 on the same road, No. 214, No. 528 Yulin Road, No. 38, No. 2 Huasheng Road, and No. 8, stealing clothing and silver worth several hundred yuan. The victims were all present, and some of the stolen goods were recovered from various pawnshops. The prosecution requested that the robbery and murder case be heard first. Zhang Xianjun confessed to the police that Ma A'er had initiated the plan, inviting him along with "Long Black Charcoal" and two men from Qingkou. Ji Haikun also went. Long Black Charcoal and the Qingkou men climbed over the wall by stepping on each other's shoulders. Long Black Charcoal and the Qingkou men held the knives. After the fact, they were given 15 yuan. Because Long Black Charcoal knew the murdered maidservant Zhou Lu, he killed her. Long Black Charcoal was also known as "Turtle." At the time, Zhou Lu called for help. Zhang Xianming firmly denied involvement, claiming he had been in his hometown. Ji Haikun admitted that Ma A'er had initiated the plan and Zhang Xianjun had invited him. Long Black Charcoal stood on Ma A'er's body, Ma A'er stood on Zhang Xianjun's body, Zhang Xianjun stood on Ji's shoulders, and they climbed over the wall. Ma A'er and Long Black Charcoal committed the murder. Afterwards, Long Black Charcoal pawned the stolen clothing. After being apprehended, the detectives led them to the victim's home to reenact the events, which matched Ma A'er's previous confession. The confessions of the three defendants were presented. Subsequently, Zhu Fu, the wife of Zhu Yangshan, stated that her husband operated a pawnshop at 196 East Xihua Road. She and her husband had gone to Wuxi for medical treatment when the incident occurred. The murdered were her relative Gu Cao and the maidservant Zhou Lu, who were guarding the house. The 430 yuan in silver was spent in May. The stolen clothing consisted of fine furs, a total of ten boxes, nine of which were opened. Only one purple fur coat was recovered. When newly made, they were worth 6,000-7,000 yuan. She did not recognize any of the defendants and her husband had no enemies. She believed the servants had leaked information about the family's trip to other places. Judge Xiao ordered the three defendants to be questioned separately. When Zhang Xianjun was questioned, he completely retracted his confession to the police, claiming that he had returned to his hometown with his wife, brother Xianming, and two friends on July 10 to celebrate the festival and worship their ancestors, returning to Shanghai on August 18. He denied going to the victim's home, killing the two women, and stealing the clothing. He claimed that his confession to the police was false. The court declared, "There is no need for you to quibble. Ma A'er has already confessed in detail." He was ordered to present Zhang Xianming's confession, who stated that he, his brother Xianjun, and his sister-in-law returned to their hometown together on July 10. His brother only stayed in the hometown for half a month, then returned to Shanghai with his sister-in-law first. He arrived in Shanghai on August 28 and knew nothing about the murder and theft. Ji Haikun also denied all of his confession to the police. Ma A'er also claimed not to recognize the three defendants. Even he, himself, admitted that his death sentence was unjust. Judge Xiao further questioned the three defendants in detail, pointing out contradictions. All of them denied going to rob and murder. The court then heard the robbery case, and ordered them back to detention to await further questioning.</p>

He was discovered, and the returned check notified the branch. The police were notified, and they located Song hiding at his home in Wandang Lane, West Gate. Detective Mao Shengsheng and Bao Detective Jiang Changwen went to arrest him, finding a secretly made key and a Jin Cheng Bank passbook, along with suspects Jian Gurong and Song's father, Song Hailin. All were arrested and transferred to the Second Special District Criminal Court for investigation. After two hearings, the defendant Song Yexi confessed to the theft. Jian and Song's father denied collusion. The court declared the debate closed, awaiting a scheduled verdict. Yesterday, the date for the verdict arrived. At 10 AM, Judge Xiong presided over the First Criminal Court, ordering the defendant to be brought to court and declaring the verdict. Song Yexi was sentenced to one year and eight months imprisonment for theft. The number of days he was detained before the verdict would be counted as two days of imprisonment for one day of detention. The key was confiscated. Jian Shunrong and Song Hailin were acquitted.</p>

<p>▲ Both Exchanges Request Abolition of Floor Price</p>
<p>▲ Ministry of Finance Orders Bank Association to Discuss</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, the Ministry of Finance recently received requests from the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange and the Commodities Exchange regarding the previous restriction on the minimum price of all public bonds, which the Ministry of Finance had imposed to maintain the price of public bonds, prohibiting prices from exceeding the standard of November 24. Since the implementation of this measure, the credit of public bonds has been maintained, but the responsibility of the exchange to balance market conditions has been constrained, and the bond market has become stagnant. Therefore, they recently requested the Ministry of Finance to abolish the order restricting prices. The Ministry of Finance reviewed the results and believed that the abolition of restrictions was greatly related to the rise and fall of public bonds. To handle this matter carefully, they ordered the Bank Association to discuss and decide and submit all opinions to the Ministry of Finance for reference. The Bank Association held a meeting at 2 PM yesterday to discuss this matter. The discussion concluded that the Ministry of Finance has the authority to maintain public bonds. The previous restriction on price drops was a fundamental way to maintain bond credit. If the Ministry of Finance believes that this abolition is feasible, the banking industry should comply and not object. The results of the meeting were sent to the Ministry of Finance last night to report everything.</p>

<p>▲ Workers' Delegation Has Implemented the Takeover of the Publishing Industry Branch Office</p>
<p>Because the workers of the Commercial Press opposed the Publishing Industry Union, they automatically convened a general assembly on the 10th of this month and elected a 27-member delegation responsible for maintaining it for several days. It is now known that the delegation implemented the decision of the general assembly the day before yesterday, carrying out the takeover of the union office. At the time, Wang Changyuan and others pre-arranged three workers, including Lu Dacai, armed with iron rulers and bayonets, intending to resist forcefully. Fortunately, Inspector Gao of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau arrived and suppressed them, preventing an incident from occurring. Inspector Gao then took Lu and the other two, along with the weapons, to the bureau for punishment. After taking over the union office, the workers' delegation inspected the interior and found that all documents and books had already been moved out. The delegation is preparing to investigate. It is also reported that yesterday morning, Wang and Yang and others were unwilling to accept this and hired many thugs to try to regain the union office. The workers' maintenance team prepared by the delegation was also on high alert, so the situation was extremely bad, but fortunately, no accident occurred. It is also fortunate that, according to a reliable investigation, the majority of the factory workers sympathize with the delegation.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical workers of this port expressed dissatisfaction with the Pharmaceutical Workers' Association, so all the workers automatically organized a reorganization committee, electing Fang Zheng, Hua Qiang, Huang Zhi San, and 14 others as members of the reorganization committee to handle reorganization matters. After the reorganization committee resolved to formally take over the trade union yesterday, the representatives of the workers of each store, more than 500 people, together with all the members of the reorganization committee, went to the Yaowang Temple of the Drug Bureau Lane in Nanshi, inside the trade union. The former standing committee of the union handled the handover. However, due to time constraints, the procedures could not be completed that day and will have to be continued today. The reorganization committee had previously sent a letter to the Third Branch of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting police protection, so there was no disturbance.</p>

Therefore, the Chinese Kuomintang should strive for the interests of the oppressed masses, especially to help workers' and peasants' organizations according to the program and policies of the Principle of the People's Livelihood, so that the working and peasant masses can achieve thorough liberation. Only those who can express such propositions in practical actions can be regarded as true and loyal followers of the Premier. In recent years, how the Party has handled the mass movement, and what its attitude has been, can be judged by discerning people, and there is no need to elaborate. What we want to say is that at this time when the Japanese invaders are rampant and the national crisis is urgent, the Party and the government should seize the opportunity to make it a backing for diplomacy. However, the responsible personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department do not hesitate to resort to kidnapping the masses who resist Japan and save the country, which is shocking and outrageous. Fortunately, the pure and revolutionary Party members of this city have risen up to improve Party affairs. From now on, there will be new and reasonable developments in guiding the mass movement, so that the majority of the oppressed masses, under this guidance, can do their best to attack Japanese imperialism and all feudal forces. Our association sincerely supports the City Party Affairs Improvement Council. We hereby declare."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Minhang Town Chamber of Commerce in the first district of Shanghai County issued a notice urging all businesses to sell domestic goods.

This chamber of commerce has also repeatedly issued notices, hoping that all businesses will permanently boycott Japanese goods to fulfill their responsibility as citizens. However, we believe that boycotting Japanese goods is only an active part of the anti-Japanese effort, and the primary way to actively save the country is to vigorously promote domestic goods, so that we can expel the position occupied by Japanese goods, to save our economic rights and rescue the country from danger."</p>

<p>Today's news reports that Prince Kan'in has been appointed as Chief of the General Staff. Prince Kan'in is the Japanese Emperor's uncle and has long been highly regarded by the army. He is the leader of the Brocade Banner Alliance organized by the young army. Kan'in was the mastermind behind this dispatch of troops to Liaodong. The diplomatic corps obeyed without daring to argue because Kan'in was acting as the head of the military. Now that he has personally assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff, the Japanese Chief of the General Staff has the power to freely mobilize troops without going through the cabinet, so the dispatch of Japanese troops in the future will definitely be even worse than in the past. Seeing this telegram, I cannot help but worry. Looking back at the sluggishness of our country's civil and military officials, the people should devote themselves to urging the government. Now that students are fighting desperately at the expense of their lives, how can fathers and brothers remain silent?</p>

<p>— Yu Youren</p>
<p>Unable to bear seeing Wang ______ becoming a national martyr. The sky is filled with wind and fog, and wild geese are flying south. I climb up the tomb road with my staff to cry. When the grass is yellow, my temples are also gray.</p>
<p>This poem is the recent work of Mr. Yu Youren. The phrase "Wang ______ becoming a national martyr" in the first sentence seems to deeply lament that there is no one to wield a weapon to defend the country, and it only makes the young people try to die for peace with empty hands. The last sentence changes one character in Mr. Wang Jingwei's poem. Today is the same as last year, and the situation is equally difficult. The tone is sad, and the meaning is also bitter.

<h3 id="e171">What Does This Mean <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Before Chiang Kai-shek stepped down, he suddenly released three military men to be the chairmen of the provincial governments. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Almost all of the national civil administration of China is in the hands of military men. The only slightly fortunate ones are Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Now the authorities suddenly issued the order of Gu Zhutong as the head of Jiangsu and Lu Diping as the head of Zhejiang, and from then on, the whole country will become a uniform world of military men.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the military is to protect the country, not to govern the people. Today, the military men of China abandon their natural duty of protecting the country and overstep their authority to govern the people. What does this mean?</p>

<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi is an old member of the Japanese Civil Party and an old friend of our country's Sun Yat-sen whom he had been deeply associated with thirty years ago. This time, Mr. Inukai, as a supporter of the Seiyukai, did not hesitate to use his seventy-year-old head to re-enter the political arena to show his tough and aggressive plan and extend his wrist to our Northeast, and will soon fully achieve the ambitions inherited from the Tanaka era. Inukai Tsuyoshi's cabinet formation poses a very pressing threat to our country's future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I chatted with my friend Mr. Qin Musan. Mr. Qin also sighed when he heard about this. Then he slammed the table and said, "Why are you so worried?" When asked why, he said, "Even if Japan has dogs, it doesn't know that our country has horses. Although dogs are larger than dogs, they can't guard the house. Forming a cabinet with dogs is just a puppy. How can it be better than a horse that can gallop away from the dust, carry soldiers to victory on the battlefield, and better defend our borders?" I then knew that using "horse" to counter "dog" was a coincidence. Because "Yang Yi" has "Xiufang" two words in it, it is enough to be it. Now General Ma Zhanshan is fighting Japan with a single division in a desolate area, which is admired by the whole country. Everyone knows his name, but doesn't know that his name is "Xiufang", which is inevitable. I realized that using "Xiufang" to counter "Yang Yi" is truly a solid and accurate match. Mr. Qin really has a different understanding. Fang has this expression, or some say that "Xiufang" two words are too soft, not as rigid as "Yang Yi". I said no, no, not so. Our country has always advocated peace, and gentleness is enough to overcome rigidity, and rigidity is ultimately disturbed by gentleness and frustrated to annihilation. There are many in the world who do not know it. So the discussion was settled. Asked Yu Zhi to fulfill this talk.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Record of the Recently Lost Dede Wheel <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Daji wheel of the Dada Company caught fire midway, causing a tragic death of many lives. The reporter once wrote to record it. After a short period of time, the company's Dede wheel was again heard to have been burned. The huge number of casualties and the heavy losses were more than before. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe at sea.</p>
<p>It is found that Dada Company was founded by the late sage Zhang Jizhi of Nantong. Those who travel outside the Yangtze River were initially Daji, Dashun, Dede, and Dahe wheels. Later, Daji and Dashun were sold or re-routed due to the small size of the wheels. The company added Daqing and Daji wheels to undertake its scarcity. The Daji was destroyed in the spring. Recently, it has been repaired and launched and renamed Dayu. In fact, the company currently has four wheels, namely Dede, Dahe, Daqing, and Dayu.</p>
<p>The four wheels travel between Shanghai and Yangzhou, and their lives are prosperous. Dayu and Daqing are new ships, with larger tonnage and better equipment. Dahe has the best machinery and travels quickly. Dede is weak and weak. People in Tongyang call it "old woman". They are reluctant to take it unless they have to. From Tong to Shanghai, other wheels can arrive at noon. Dede does not handle it until 3 or 4 pm. In recent years, the machine parts have been slightly changed, and there has been slight progress compared to before. In the eyes of Tongyang people</p>
<h3 id="e174">Wood Overcomes Earth <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>After Chiang Kai-shek resigned and stepped down as Chairman of the National Government, the successor was Lin Chao, an old comrade with high morals and prestige. Lin is named Sen. The name is analyzed. A total of five woods were formed. Comedians called him Mr. Five Willows. According to the five elements, wood can overcome earth. It is compared to the brutality of the violent sun and the invasion of our territory. The commander of the Northeast sits and watches the fall of He Shan without resisting. This national land of the three provinces may be recovered by Lin Lao Zhuxi. Our people will wait and see. (Thanks for the reward)</p>
<p>of. Dede is still the worst of the four wheels.</p>
<p>In the past, when Mr. Zhang Jizhi was in Japan, he had to take Dede when he traveled back and forth to Shanghai. It was not because he liked its slowness, but because the bottom of the Dede ship was wider, and there was no suffering from shaking. This time it was accidentally caused by the cigarette butts in the cotton cabin. The negligence of the management of the wheel can be seen here. It is heard that local people have asked the Ministry of Communications to strictly rectify it. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. However, where will the lives of hundreds of people be compensated?</p>
<p>After the incident, Shen Zhuowu, the former Director of the Stamp Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, has disappeared. His relatives were tragically burned to death. However, there are also those who are fortunate enough to be spared. When the Dede wheel sailed from Shanghai, Gu Boyan, the president of Jiangsu Bank of Nantong, had already booked a room on the second floor. At twelve o'clock at night, he had already boarded the wheel. Then, a friend suddenly came panting and repeatedly invited him to take the Zhidada Wheel to Yangzhou for a tour and then return to Tong. Gu had no choice but to take the Zhidada and was spared from the disaster. After the wheel caught fire, the passengers jumped into the river one after another. Although the area is a shallow beach, the weather is cold and the tide is rapid, and most of them are frozen to death. There are also frozen corpses standing upright in the mud and sand, like ice men. It can be said to be extremely tragic and painful. There was also passenger A who stole a huge box after the incident and threw everything in the box away. Yi was lying on his back in the box, rolling on the water. Then he was rescued by a fisherman and was fortunate enough to be reborn.</p>
<p>According to Shanghai-Yangzhou steamboats, they have always been safe. There has been no change for decades. However, after the Daji was burned this spring, the Dede wheel in Liuwei was washed away by bandits in the autumn. Now the whole wheel is on fire. Although the company's losses are no less than hundreds of thousands, it is still able to prevent it if it can pay attention to management methods on weekdays, such as isolating the cargo hold from idlers, assigning police escorts, and adding fire protection, etc. The past is gone. There is a long way to go. I sincerely hope that the directors of the company can be determined to reform and live up to the hard work of the late sages.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Enlistment <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>—A member of the Youth Aid Ma Garden Team</p>
<p>(3) Leaving Zhenru</p>
<p>On the morning of the ninth, after we thanked the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Jida University, the entire team headed towards Nanxiang. In less than an hour or two, the destination was seen. There were welcoming civic representatives at the station. We were very ashamed to be welcomed and encouraged by them at Guyi Garden. We stayed at the Central Elementary School at night.</p>
<p>Originally, we didn't have to walk. Because the central government has understood us and has given us first-class vehicles for the group to ride in. But we only accept the government's kindness and thank the government, but the whole group decided not to ride in the prepared vehicles. Because this can show the perseverance of our youth. It can also hone our courage. To prepare for going to Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, civic representatives from Kunshan and Suzhou came to inquire about the itinerary and dates. It is said to be convenient for welcoming, etc. But we think to ourselves. It is the duty of the people to sacrifice for the country. Now it is disturbing the people of all walks of life. The center can't help but feel bad.</p>
<p>On the tenth, a member withdrew. He originally did not want to withdraw. Because the people in his family said, "If you don't go back, the whole family will die in Nanxiang." But all of our members joined voluntarily. When joining, the review team must carefully consider it. The military knowledge, endurance, and whether there are family burdens, etc., of the members must be asked clearly before they are considered qualified. There is no form of inciting or forcing young people to join. Therefore. We also have to persuade him to withdraw when this member refuses to go back.</p>
<h3 id="e176">An Elegant Gathering Amidst the Winds and Cranes <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>In Lanling, there was already a Chrysanthemum Society. Every year, when early winter arrives, as the chrysanthemums by the fence are not yet withered and the plum blossoms on the mountain ridge are about to bloom, the host of the society, Mr. Xia Yihe, would always send invitations to guests to drink and compose poetry at Yi Garden. This year, due to the national crisis, his mood was desolate. He sent a letter in advance to consult with me. I said, "The purpose of an elegant gathering is to meet friends, not only to appreciate flowers but also to express sorrow, not to seek pleasure." Yihe then entrusted me to write a small announcement in place of invitations, saying, "Smoke of war fills the land, the wind is bleak in the north. The cries of wild geese echo, autumn ends in the south of the Yangtze River. Facing the shattered rivers and mountains, we shed tears at Xinting in vain. Moved by the desolate scenery, we cannot forget the flowers of the old garden. Thus, a mere scholar has held a thorn for ten years, harboring thoughts of joining the army, but finding no way to offer his services. Those who live in luxury are not worth consulting; we might as well submit a memorial to the northern palace. A writing brush is truly useless; it can only write rhymes by the eastern fence. Perhaps drifting on the lakes and seas, we encounter the winds and cranes in a foreign land. Separated by mountains and passes, we miss the water shields of our homeland. Perhaps bound by mossy rocks, we deeply cherish the clouds and trees. Stealing a day of leisure, we console each other about the three lives. Therefore, we agree on an auspicious time to re-invite old friends. Holding crabs, we face the chrysanthemums; arm in arm, we enter the forest. Wine can dispel sorrow, temporarily easing our solitary indignation. Flowers can understand words, sharing our hidden feelings. We entrust ourselves to the sorrowful songs of Du Fu, mourning like Changsha. May Gao has a pen; for whom does he dash off urgent letters? Xu Mian is affectionate; let him calmly judge the winds and moon. Let Tao Yuanming seek intoxication, and the Chu guest eat the fallen petals. This is also a helpless time, an unavoidable matter. Alas! Bind Du and Yin high in the pavilion, just to avoid becoming worms in the river. Tread the fragrant garden of peach and plum. Come quickly! Appreciate the falling snow before the flowers." When the appointed time arrived, the guests arrived. Old friends such as Zhuang Jichen, Zheng Zhongxiu, Fang Huqing, and Zhang Baixi, a total of ten people, sat around a table. What the guests discussed was the situation of the national crisis; what they heard was news of the national crisis; what they saw was writing about the national crisis. It was no less than opening a Gandhi-style round table conference. The host smiled and said, "Tonight, we can only talk about the winds and moon." A young guest said, "But what if the nest is overturned and no egg is left intact?" I said, "If the Wang Yifu types of that era were not in court but in the wilderness, then their empty talk would not have led the country astray. Moreover, we have no weapons in our hands; our pens cannot be turned into guns. Even if we want to save the country, our strength is insufficient. Compared to those officials and military men who hold a non-resistance doctrine, and those important figures in the party-state who destroy unity and invite foreign insults, causing concerns about partition and joint control, then we truly should not talk about national affairs." The guests were silent. Looking around at the chrysanthemums, although the flowers bloomed not near the battlefield, they all carried a sorrowful and sickly appearance, unlike their spirit in previous years. Perhaps they were also affected by the times. I could not help but think of the saying that even trees are like this.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Mr. Gao Junshan Returns from Europe and America to Discuss the National Crisis (II) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>American students have a weak sense of political awareness. Therefore, they do not pay much attention to the figures on the political stage, nor do they understand them very well. Some college students do not even know the structure of their government. In our country, not to mention college students, even some middle school students know it very well. Everyone can name who the key figures in the central government are and who the chairman of a certain province is. In America, ordinary students probably know more about movie stars and sports heroes than they know about figures on the political stage. In America, during elections, such as elections for president, governor, or mayor, each state, city, and town has polling places. However, many, many people do not participate in voting. It is not necessary to discuss general civil cases. Even among the intellectual class, there are many people who give up their rights. In short, they do not feel a strong interest in politics.</p>
<p>Recently, in our country, due to the national crisis, the people of the whole country feel the pain of national demise is imminent. They have unanimously made suggestions and petitions to the government. Innumerable young students are running around appealing and demonstrating. The public is furious, wanting to give a resounding blow to the numb and insensitive authorities. I believe that this kind of patriotic movement is respectable in its ambition, but its situation is extremely pitiable. People who are in their study years should not be made to go to study quietly, and instead, go and engage in political activities. Enduring hunger and cold is not even the worst part. Sometimes they have to suffer the schemes of villains and the oppression of the authorities. What a disservice this is to them. Some people say, "Students should not be involved in politics." I think this is a very natural inclination in a country with clear and bright politics. Just look at the American college students' interest in politics, and you will know. But in a collapsing and fragmented China, there are constant and intense stimuli. How can students maintain a calm attitude towards politics? The saying "Saving the country does not conflict with reading" is theoretically correct. But in this moment of crisis, when survival is at stake, how can you make them read in peace? The so-called "saving the country through education," "saving the country through industry," and other terms are all applicable to peaceful times. But the biggest key at the moment lies in politics. The government authorities can bring prosperity with a single word, and destroy the country with a single word. If politics is not on the right track, then education, industry, and everything else are hopeless. Some people also say that during the Franco-Prussian War, even with the sound of cannons faintly heard outside Paris, the students in the city could still calmly attend classes. Of course, they had great generals who defended the country and protected the people, fighting the enemy on the front lines, without worries about the rear. Looking back at our country, what is it like? When enemy troops approach the border, they abandon their weapons and flee. Within a few days, they lose the territory of three provinces. How can this be compared to France? Therefore, the fact that American students are not interested in politics is their blessing, not their weakness. Compared to them, the students in our country are much more unfortunate.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Righteousness Obliterates Kinship</p>
<p>The next morning, Hua Naiqiang finished breakfast and was sitting in the guest room, feeling depressed and studying a map. Suddenly, Zhongshu gracefully entered, her face showing worry. Naiqiang invited her to sit down and said to her, "Looking at the map, there is a high mountain southwest of T city. It leans against the mountain and borders the river, making it a good place to defend. It can serve as a shield for T city. For the sake of preparedness, why doesn't your father quickly send a brigade of troops to garrison there, to block the enemy's path of attack?" Zhongshu stamped her leather shoes and said, "Brother Naiqiang, why keep talking such nonsense? Let me be honest with you. My father has already surrendered to the Sun Army." When Hua Naiqiang heard this, he jumped up and said, "How… how could he willingly surrender to the bandits?" Zhongshu said, "Last night, my father spent the entire evening discussing military affairs in a secret room. I went over there to spy and saw several Sun Country people inside, acting suspiciously and not knowing what they were discussing. I was very suspicious. For a while, I couldn't find my father. I ran to my father's room this morning to ask, and then I learned the truth. Alas…" Zhongshu paused as she said this. Hua Naiqiang said, "What is the truth?" Zhongshu said, "Originally, my father was tempted and coerced by the people of the Sun Country, and he changed his mind. He is willing to be their lackey and is about to send troops to attack H Province. I heard that a large batch of weapons and ammunition from the Sun Country will be transported here today to supply my father's army. Tomorrow, they will attack H Province. Brother Naiqiang, what should be done about this? I am unfortunate to be the daughter of a traitor. I think it's better to leave this place. I really can't bear to see this sad situation." Hua Naiqiang clenched his fists and slammed them on the table, saying, "Traitor! I shouldn't be scolding your father in front of a lady. He really is blinded by greed, not wanting to have his name remembered forever like Zhang Qiaoyang, but willing to imitate Wu Sangui and leave a stinking name for ten thousand years. Old and muddled to the extreme. China actually has this kind of soldier. My blood is boiling! Traitors should be killed by everyone." After Hua Naiqiang finished speaking, his face turned green with anger. Zhongshu covered her face and wept. After a long while, she said, "I have no face to live in the world. I'll just die. Brother Naiqiang, please take care of yourself for the sake of the country. It's best to leave this place as soon as possible." Naiqiang rubbed his hands, just thinking deeply. Zhongshu's words were as if he hadn't heard them. After a moment, Hua Naiqiang shook his hand at Zhongshu and said, "Lady, don't cry. I've come up with a plan. I don't know if you agree." Zhongshu stopped crying and wiped away her tears with a handkerchief. She asked attentively, "What good plan is it?" But Naiqiang hesitated and said, "It's hard to say." Zhongshu said, "Anything can be said. There's no one around here. Tell me quickly!" Hua Naiqiang walked to her side and whispered many words into her ear. Then, with both hands, he stood back by the table, waiting for her to decide.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Finance: Gold Market in a Peaceful State <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲Slightly Better Result: Yesterday's gold market was stable and then declined, with a peaceful situation and relatively calm sentiment among dealers. However, the forward market still had a large lot of ten taels, and the backward market fluctuated by only seven or eight taels. The high and low prices for the day differed by more than twelve taels, with the final result being a slight drop of about two taels. The trend was still acceptable. Initially, due to the continued rise of large silver bars, the opening price was lower. Later, a certain bank and Hengxing and other companies bought in, suddenly pushing the price above 670 taels. Afterward, as exchange rates eased, the Central Bank aggressively sold spot US dollars, and the price dropped again by more than ten taels. However, buying momentum gradually increased in the market. At noon, the price rose again to 70 taels. The backward market already showed signs of weakness, and because exchange rates were not tight, the price fluctuated constantly. Finally, the price ended at around 667-668 taels.</p>
<p>▲Slight Fluctuations in the Morning: The market opened lower by 2.80 yuan at 666 yuan due to the increase of 3/16 in the price of large silver bars and 1/4 in forward prices. However, the expected decline from the previous day did not materialize. The next price was 65 yuan, but the Bank of America did not change its rate, and private telegrams showed a small decrease of 1/8, so the price increased to 68 yuan. Helplessly, Dalian Bank and others sold, and the price retreated again to 64.5 yuan. Subsequently, Zhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Hengxing, Fuyu, Dakang, and others competed to buy, and a certain bank bought a considerable amount, causing the price to rise prosperously. The initial settlement price for US dollars in January was 34.125 yuan. Later, Mitsui sold to HSBC at 33.9375 yuan for April, so at 9:15, the price was 74.5 yuan. In a moment, it softened again because HSBC offered 33.875 yuan for April, and Yongfeng, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, and others unloaded their holdings. When the British gold price was announced, it was 65 yuan, but the listed price did not change, and the US dollar decreased slightly by 0.25, so the price became 67.5 yuan. Before long, British gold for March could be settled at 11 pence 8/25, and HSBC also offered 34.1875 to 0.25 yuan for US dollars for March. In addition, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Hengyu, Richang, and others came to compete to sell, so the price dropped to 56 taels. Ten taels were sold at 62 yuan. Later, Mitsui and others absorbed 1875 for March, and the April settlement price was 34 yuan. Hengxing, Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, and Mr. Wu chased the price up, and by 10:30, it rose to 70 yuan. Subsequently, Yuanmao, Taichang, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, and others sold, and by 11:00, the price was 65.5 yuan. Afterward, it gradually went upstream because Hengyu, Changsheng, Yongcui, Changyong, Neixing, and others all bought in. The Central Bank sold spot US dollars to Huabi at 34.0625 yuan and advanced funds. The situation then became tighter, and banks traded April at 3.9375 yuan and January at 4 yuan. Hua Bank absorbed February at 4 yuan. Zhengjin offered 3.875 yuan for March, and the gold price rose again to 8 taels. At 11:20, it was 73.4 yuan. However, some were sold for hedging, and the Bank of China sold to Huabi and Zhejiang February at 34 yuan, only four or five minutes apart. The price then retreated to 69.5 yuan. Suddenly, the air of uprightness was turned once again, due to continuous buying and zero lots were also buying in. The settlement price for short-term US dollars was 3.9375 yuan and the long-term price was 8125. The British gold price remained unchanged, so the closing price was 72.7 yuan. From 11:30 to noon, the range was only a little over one tael, and the increased price was changed to 722 taels, with a discount of 60 to 50 taels.</p>
<p>▲Gradually Softened in the Afternoon: The afternoon market opened weakly at 69.5 yuan because the Indian exchange rate reported a large increase of one anna after the noon close. Furthermore, the volume of goods had become small. The next price was 70.08 yuan. Rumors then spread that the Japanese would attack our army in Jinzhou, and Dalian Bank and Qianchangxiang and others sold out, so the price dropped by more than seven taels. At 2:15, it was 63.5 yuan. Subsequently, because the US dollar showed strength, Maxing bought spot at 34 yuan, and Great Britain bought March at 4 yuan. In the morning, banks mutually traded British gold for April at 8125, and the Central Bank sold spot to Shanghai at 4.375 to 3.125 yuan, so funds were advanced. Furthermore, Hengxing continued to buy, and Bombay also recovered by a small amount of two annas, so at 2:45, the price was 71.3 yuan. Later, Qianchangxiang, Tongtaichang, and Dadecheng sold, and at 3:15, it was around 66 yuan. In a moment, it increased again to 70.5 yuan, and then British gold for April was trading at 11 pence 6875. Suddenly, news came that the Indian exchange rate had increased by two annas, and around 4:00, it fell to 66.2 yuan. However, buyers were active on the surface, and the US dollar remained firm. The settlement price for the short term was 25 and the long term was 3.875 yuan. As the close approached, it was 69.8 yuan. Then, because Zhifengyong and others sold, the closing price at 4:30 was 67 yuan, a decrease of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous day. It then traded again at 68 yuan. According to the maximum price for the day of 74.5 yuan and the minimum price of 62 yuan, there was a fluctuation of 12.5 yuan. The opening price for goods in the morning was 66 yuan, the noon close was 73.5 yuan, the afternoon was 70 yuan, and the closing price was 67.5 yuan, with a discount of 50 to 55 or 56 yuan. The registered prices were 80 yuan for December, 83 yuan for January, and 73 yuan for February. The afternoon prices were 74 yuan to 77 yuan for February, and the supplementary water was 80 yuan. The afternoon price was 74 yuan, and the red line only increased by 12 taels because goods were continuously arriving.</p>
<p>▲Discrepancies in Receipts and Payments in the Market: According to transaction statistics on the table, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Yuanchun, Dakang, Hongkangyong, Yuancheng Yong, Fuyu, Yuankangxiang, Qianchangxiang, and a certain bank all bought in, and Mr. Wu also bought in. Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Yongfeng, Richang, and Wanxing all sold. Yuantai, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Futaiheng, and others had inconsistent inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Yuanxingyong, Shunli, and a certain bank all bought in. Yuanmaoyong, Hongkangyong, and Tongtaichang had irregular inflows and outflows. Zhiyong, Cuichangyong, and Yifengyong all sold. The receipts and payments of the remaining firms were all different. Guangdong firms bought more than 3,000 silver bars, which was said to be trading on behalf of a certain bank. Dalian firms sold a total of more than 1,800 silver bars and bought 400 or 500.</p>

<p>▲The Headlock Gets Closer... Only 30 Yuan Apart</p>
<p>▲The Central Bank Competitively Sells... Receiving Funds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bank of England’s interest rate was not changed, but the exchange rates still diverged. The exchange rate between British currency and the U.S. dollar rose, calculating to 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, 2 li, 5 hao, and the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British currency decreased slightly, calculating to 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 3 fen. The HSBC listed price for British currency was the same as before, and the U.S. dollar decreased by 0.25, calculating to 33.25 yuan. Due to the exchange rates, the exchange rate for the French franc decreased by 6 yuan, the German exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan, and the Japanese yen increased by 1.5 yuan. There were no other increases or decreases. The bank’s internal rates seemed chaotic, with constant rises and falls. The initial rate for British gold was stable, and then it stabilized. The U.S. dollar rate went from stable to rising, then eased and showed strength, and finally seemed to be falling. The result showed an increase of 1.875 yuan for British gold compared to the previous day, and the U.S. dollar remained the same. The gold market was firm and then soft, fluctuating around 70 taels. The volume of trade by Chinese merchants was still high. The trade volume for British gold was more than 10,000 pounds, with varying inflows and outflows. The trade volume for U.S. dollars was about 1 million yuan, with inconsistent terms. The Central Bank worked hard to sell spot currency and buy gold. Gold firms settled transactions to offset previous short positions and invested in funds to hedge.

<p>▲Peaceful Trend, Market Sentiment Still Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for various bonds and securities on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was still generally active in the futures market. However, compared to the previous day, the selling sentiment in the market had become slightly more idle. The number of spot transactions was still high, but the volume of transactions was not as high as before. The situation for each bond continued to be relatively peaceful, but the market sentiment felt weaker than before. Although the domestic political situation seemed to be good, the attitude of the Japanese was strong, increasing troops in the Northeast and threatening to invade Jinzhou again. The situation in Pingjin turned serious again, and the Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation worsened. The market felt uneasy about this situation, and selling was active. The demand from buyers was quieter than before. The prices of various bonds fell across the board due to supply exceeding demand. The overall trend was still quite peaceful. The prices fell sharply in the first session, but then hovered without significant ups and downs. As a result, except for a few spots that had no market the previous day and therefore still rose, all others weakened. For example, the demobilization bond for January, the tariff bond for December, the demobilization bond for January, and the salt tax bond for January all fell by more than one yuan. The others also fell by about half a yuan. The situation in the bond market was more depressed than before, and the market sentiment was cold, no longer as optimistic as it had been in recent days. The total volume of spot transactions for the day was 30,400 yuan. The volume of futures transactions was 3.95 million in the morning and 2.17 million in the afternoon, totaling 6.12 million yuan. Transactions for January accounted for about 2 million yuan. The opening price, closing price, and transaction volume for each bond are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market is generally sluggish, and the situation is weakening. This is primarily due to the instability of national affairs and the extreme tightness of finances. Most people in the market are bearish. However, demand from Sichuan and Changsha merchants is relatively strong, while other merchants are mostly inactive. Nonetheless, manufacturers are still buying when prices fall.</p>
<p>▲ Renbiao Market Atmosphere is Quiet: In the Renbiao exchange's morning session, American cotton prices were flat. There was very little trading activity. Prices for all months fell by 0.013 yuan. The afternoon session was even weaker, with prices falling by 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.07 yuan for various months. The total volume of transactions for the day was 10,500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is very weak due to the pessimistic outlook in overseas cotton markets. However, the slight rebound in gold prices has somewhat stabilized sentiment. Actual demand is very low. Factories have no plans to buy because most have already stocked up on foreign cotton and have no interest in domestic cotton. Therefore, the overall trend is very weak. However, bullish investors are holding tightly to distant months.</p>
<p>▲ Hanbiao Market: Prices Soften in the Afternoon: In the Hanbiao market's morning session, American cotton prices were flat, and near-month contracts were heavily bought, rising by 0.015 yuan. Distant months were flat. In the afternoon, prices for all months fell by 0.005 to 0.01 yuan. The total volume of transactions for the day was 30,900 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by traders, but weakened later due to the poor performance of Wall Street and reactive selling. Futures prices fell by 1 to 4 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures fell by 6-7 points, while spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. European exporters and Japanese merchants sold small quantities of Indian cotton, but these were absorbed by speculators. Pingguoer rose by 3.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated 17th):</p>

<p>▲ Nantou: Yesterday, there were not many incoming shipments, about twenty ships. The inventory at the wharves was not weak. Retailers in cities and towns felt that business was even slower. Yesterday was also the day for the Yimiao Cuixiu Tang Rice Industry Association to compare measures. Sixty to seventy measures were compared, but there were no transactions. Prices generally weakened slightly. There were about eighty boatmen from the Pujiang River, carrying about 6,400 bags of white glutinous and indica rice.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: The flow of goods down the Suzhou River is still strong, but sales in this area are sluggish.</p>
<p>Xi Xin Gao Ding, the secondary grade is shrinking by nearly a corner. Transactions in Kunshan, Danyang, and other goods are increasingly rare.</p>
<p>Be wary of further declines. There are fewer early and late rice crops from Chonggu, Songjiang Quan, and Jing, etc. Prices have changed by one or two corners. Incoming goods are being accepted, but there are few retail transactions. Distilleries are not active, causing prices to weaken. Shipments to the Dujian dock are also rare, showing stability.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Spot Foreign Rice Sales are Active <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shipments are being arranged to Hankou and Northern China</p>
<p>The spot foreign rice market, despite some weakness, has not fully recovered. In addition to continued purchases by the Hankou merchants, merchants from Northern China have also begun to inquire. As market prices have repeatedly declined, they have already approached low price levels. There are also concerns that the import of Annam rice may be blocked, so sentiment has generally improved, attracting the attention of various merchants. Yesterday, Hankou merchants shipped over a thousand bags, and Northern China merchants bought five to six hundred bags. In addition to buying spot goods, Northern China merchants are also buying forward contracts. Total market transactions included 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, priced at 9.00 to 9.30 yuan, and 1,500 bags of No. 1 West Rice, priced at 10.056 to 11.05 yuan. A forward Xiaojiao contract for 1,500 tons for February delivery was sold by Xiangmao, priced at 4.27 taels, and was bought by merchants from this area and Northern China. The price of the forward contract was slightly lower than before, while spot prices were higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the starch noodle market was generally fluctuating. Although foreign wheat prices fell by about 0.06 or 0.07 yuan, most manufacturers had already cleared their positions due to the approaching delivery date. Only small and medium-sized factories still had open positions. There was also some activity from merchants. Although foreign wheat prices for distant months fell, there was no news of spot foreign wheat being offered for sale. Therefore, manufacturers remained on the sidelines, and selling was very quiet. After observing the market, it is expected to consolidate for a few days. The price for this month was only slightly lower by 0.0025 yuan compared to the previous day, the price for January was better by 0.01 yuan, the price for February was better by 0.0025 yuan, the price for March was lower by 0.005 yuan, and the price for April and May was better by 0.0055 yuan.</p>

<p>▲ Wheat Factories Continue to Take Delivery This Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market was generally stable after opening in the morning. Sentiment was relatively stable because foreign wheat prices fell by 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. However, trading was very quiet, with both buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach. By the afternoon session, market sentiment had improved. Since factories continued to take delivery this month, approximately 20 to 30 truckloads were taken. Sentiment suddenly improved, and because there were fewer sellers and eager buyers for distant months, prices were driven higher. As a result, the price for this month rose by 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day, the price for January rose by 0.05 yuan, the prices for January, February, and March rose by 0.04 yuan, the price for April rose by 0.02 yuan, and the price for May rose by 0.01 yuan.</p>

<p>▲ Coarse Sand White Sugar Also Gradually Tends to Strengthen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from production areas. The spot price of Cuban sugar was 1.125, up 0.03125 from the previous report. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.04 for December, 1.10 for March of next year, 1.15 for May, and 1.25 for September, each up 0.01 from the previous day. Spot Javanese sugar still lacked upside or downside movement. The association's market was flat. Due to tight foreign exchange rates, the market for Dutch No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was trending upward, with transaction prices reaching 9.45 taels. Outbound shipments were scarce, and the market later stabilized around 9.50 taels. No. 20 medium white sand sugar was priced at 9.40 taels, and fine Dutch white sugar was priced at 11.10 taels. The market was quite strong. Trading in Taikoo sugar was quite active, with prices rising slightly. B Mark was priced at 11.60 taels, Huaxin's offering of over 400 bags of CW Mark at 11.55 taels, HX Mark at 11.45 taels, and HM Mark at 11.35 taels, with re-announcements at 11.40 taels. Inbound and outbound shipments were smooth, and the market was quite bullish, with a general sense of rising prices.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Piece Goods: Eastern Goods Secretly Resurge <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Eastern goods and piece goods had disappeared from the market since the invasion of Manchuria by Japan, due to patriotic citizens' economic boycotts. It has been almost three months, and inspections are not as strict as before, and goods have dropped drastically in price. Certain individuals are taking advantage of this situation, especially by relabeling goods, which is especially prevalent for colorful velvet. Labels are cut off and replaced with domestic labels, and the goods can be sold unhindered. Fine cloth, twill, serge, etc. have also been discovered, which has hurt the sales of genuine goods. Although it is approaching the New Year holiday, and despite internal and external pressures, the infiltration of Eastern goods is significant. White velvet was especially sluggish yesterday. Double Fish and Jiqing at 16 pounds have entered the lower price range. Dasheng Electric at 10.035 taels was very slow moving. Only Jincheng at 9 pounds was quite strong, requiring 6.95 taels. Spot goods were scarce. A large batch of Dasheng to Peacock fine cloth was offered at 7.5 taels, and there was significant inbound buying in this area. Yuanfang's bidding has resumed after stopping the second round, and prices are slightly better. Yuanrong and bleached cloth remained unchanged. Yu Chou silk was slightly more active. Fairly priced Tianci Huangjin Qiaofacai was 14 taels, Sanyou Tu was 13.75 taels. Coarse cloth was in a complete slump. 9 pounds were at 4.78 taels, 11 pounds fell to 5 taels, and 13 pounds were around 6 taels. Only Wuhe at 16 pounds remained at 8.2 taels. Coarse twill was also weak.</p>

<p>New Xiamen soft cakes, the previous batch of goods that arrived had not sold well, had not been priced for a long time. Yesterday I heard that Northern merchants had continued to take possession of the goods, so the numbered goods were immediately opened for sale. The goods are still good, but it is the first time seeing new products, the skin color is yellow, not very red and bright, the price is nineteen taels, probably the next batch can arrive next week, and the cake color will definitely be more rosy and moist.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Metals: New Lead Wire Prices are Lowered to Encourage Sales <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The transaction of new lead wire, recently, has been unusually difficult, there are no major purchases by the military or government, and factory purchases are also insufficient, so the sales are too slow, but the arrival of goods is abnormally crowded and the supply is greater than the demand, which has become an undeniable fact, at the same time, due to the approaching New Year's Day, they all want to restrain their pockets and return the money to the banks, so they are willing to lower prices to encourage sales, merchants, due to tight money, have no quantity to purchase, so the decoration in the market is very little, standard is oppressed by the bad environment, but more and more goes downhill, such as rough flower color telegram silk is only sold for nine taels a little more, medium grade flower color is only offered at twelve taels seven and a half cents, fine flower color is scarce in coming goods, stock is slightly thin, so the standard can be offered up to eighteen taels five or six cents.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Japanese Imperialism's Economic Aggression Against China – and Collection <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>By Hou Houpei and Wu Juenong</p>
<p>Published by Liming Publishing House</p>
<p>China's writing circles are inherently impoverished; there are deficiencies in writing in all areas. But comparatively speaking, works on Japanese imperialism, especially after the September 18th Incident, are more plentiful than in other areas. From major works of two or three hundred thousand characters to small booklets of several thousand characters, given the impoverished state of the publishing industry, it cannot be considered completely silent. And among these numerous works studying the Japanese problem, we cannot help but highlight this book, "Japanese Imperialism's Economic Aggression Against China," co-authored by Hou Houpei and Wu Juenong. The reasons can be divided into:</p>
<p>First, as the authors said in the preface, "Japan has been plotting aggression against China for a long time. This occupation of Manchuria and Jehol is a full expression of Japanese imperialism's aggression in China. Although the incident occurred in a violent form, whether for immediate or long-term reasons, it is fundamentally backed by economics. Japan's economic power in China is more advantageous than that of other countries, and its methods of economic aggression are also more active. The success of economic aggression against China is the success of Japanese imperialism's continental policy." Using economic aggression to explain the entirety of Japanese aggression against China truly grasps the core of the issue. Understanding the content of Japanese economic aggression against China allows one to know the entirety of Japan's ambition and methods for invading China. Current books on the market about Japanese imperialism either only consider one aspect of the problem or only the surface. This is one difference between this book and others.</p>
<p>Second, Japanese aggression against China is a complete problem, not a partial one. In other words, Japanese aggression against China has a consistent policy and is definitely not a local or one-sided issue. For example, Tanaka's active policy of aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia states, "Using the rights in Manchuria and Mongolia as a command tower, we will seize all of China's resources. Using China's resources, we will conquer India, the South Seas Islands, Asia Minor, and Europe. Our Yamato race's desire to display its military prowess on the Asian continent depends on holding the rights in Manchuria and Mongolia, which is the first key. Moreover, ultimate victory relies on food supplies, the prosperity of industry relies on raw materials, and the strengthening of national power truly relies on China's vast territory." Thus, local records or narratives cannot explain the consistent policy of Japanese imperialism's aggression. Most of the books on Japanese imperialism on the market are biased toward one aspect, especially the three eastern provinces. Little do they know that Japanese imperialism's aggression against China is progressing on multiple fronts, and each front is mutually supportive. Therefore, the Manchurian Incident is just one part of Japan's total aggression against China, or rather the most obvious part. But if one wants to understand Japan's entire policy of aggression, one must further understand the economic power of its headquarters in China. Moreover, one can say that without understanding Japan's total economic power in China, one cannot have a correct understanding of the Manchurian Incident. This book's perspective is national, not limited to any one part. Of course, Japan's economic power is most significant in the three eastern provinces, but there are many economic matters that the three eastern provinces do not possess. This book's sources are balanced, which is another point of difference from all other books in this area.</p>
<p>Third, materials are the lifeblood of a book. To put it bluntly, the quality of a book depends entirely on its materials. Currently, the materials used in books on the Japanese problem are mostly outdated and copied repeatedly, without questioning the source of the materials, leading to errors being passed on.</p>
<p>It is truly rare to have "original materials," that is, "direct materials." This book, however, "uses all actual materials for objective narration... The collection of materials is primarily based on direct sourcing, either through personal direct investigation or by collecting business reports, meeting minutes, and rosters that the Japanese do not normally circulate outside, and compiling them. Therefore, the various statistics in the book are quite detailed. Other materials taken from various Chinese and Western books and newspapers are also carefully referenced and corrected before being transcribed." Leaving aside other things, the book contains many secret reports obtained by Japanese ronin, such as the so-called Records of the Manchuria and Mongolia Rights Support Conference revealed by the Yishi Daily. For example, statistics on Japanese enterprises in Shanghai and statistics on exporters have not only been unknown in the past, but even with the intention to investigate, it would be difficult to get results. This is what makes this book inaccessible to other books in this area.</p>
<p>These three points are the main differences between this book and other books in this area, and they are also what make this book surpass other books.</p>
<p>The authors believe that "the policy of Japanese imperialism's economic aggression against China is nothing more than two things: investment in China and seizing the market. The structure of this book is based on these two policies. The first chapter explains the origin of its economic policy towards China and its methods of aggression. The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters are about investment and the market, respectively narrating the steps of its aggression and its recent situation. The eighth chapter is about the financial institutions that assist investment and market aggression, exploring the inevitability of Japanese economic aggression against China. All economic aggression matters such as railways, shipping, agriculture, forestry, mining, industry, trade, and finance are included." The table of contents for the entire book is thus divided into: Chapter 1: Japan's Economic Aggression Policy Towards China; Chapter 2: Japan's Railway Aggression Against China; Chapter 3: Japan's Navigation Rights Aggression Against China; Chapter 4: Japan's Agricultural Aggression Against China; Chapter 5: Japan's Mining Rights Aggression Against China; Chapter 6: Japan's Industrial Aggression Against China; Chapter 7: Japan's Trade Aggression Against China; and Chapter 8: Japan's Financial Aggression Against China. The entire book is four hundred pages and</p>
<p>Amounts to two hundred thousand words. It must be considered a comprehensive overview of research on Japanese imperialism and aggression against China.</p>
<p>Researching Japanese imperialism's economic aggression against China</p>
<p>Easily flows into a defect, which is that it is either empty theory without empirical evidence or a chronological account without theoretical explanation of the facts. As mentioned above, this book's actual materials are not only rich and complete but also mostly direct and new. So, is this book just a presentation of facts without correct theoretical elucidation? Definitely not. The book's theoretical consistency and depth have equal value to the materials it has collected. In many places, it is insightful and expresses what others have not. For example, in the first chapter, the authors correctly point out that the origin of Japanese economic aggression against China is due to: first, overpopulation and food panic; second, lack of raw materials and difficult livelihoods; and third, opening up markets and developing trade. Its means of aggression have always been nothing more than three kinds:</p>
<p>1. Coercion and Enticement Policy: Regarding this point, the authors say, for example, "In the Sino-Japanese War, our country failed and signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, Japan coerced our country into signing the Twenty-One Demands. The Jinan Incident and the Mongolian Incident in 1928 are all manifestations of the coercion policy, that is, the so-called active policy of Tanaka, or the policy of forcibly seizing rights and cultivating trade." As for the Japanese government's coercion and enticement policy toward local military figures, the examples are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>2. Seizing Profitable Rights Policy: For example, "The previous railway competition, loan competition, the development of the South Manchuria Railway Company's business over the years, and the construction of the textile industry in the Yangtze River basin all demonstrate Japan's investment policy. The most significant was the conclusion of treaties with Japan during the period when Duan Qirui presided over the cabinet in 1917 and 1918, including the arms loan, wireless telegraph loan, forest development loan, Jilin loan, and reconstruction loan. At this time, Japan lent huge sums of money to China on the one hand and used them as collateral to plunder its profitable rights and property, thereby developing Japan's economic power in China."</p>
<p>3. Undermining Peace Policy: This section is even clearer and more profound: "Divide and conquer has been Japan's traditional policy toward China in recent years. As early as 1916, the assistance to the Zongshe Party's uprising and the assistance to Duan Qirui's training of the war participation army in 1918 were all clear evidence of promoting internal strife in our country. Guo Songling's revolt and Japan's dispatch of troops to southern Manchuria were to maintain the old pro-Japanese forces in Manchuria. During the Northern Expedition, troops were repeatedly sent to Shandong in order to maintain the remaining warlords of Zhili and Shandong. Zhang Zuolin was bombed in Huanggutun after the failure of the Feng clique, which was an attempt to support new forces in Manchuria and Mongolia. Since then, the Northeast has changed into an anti-Japanese force. Thus, the Japanese became vigilant and uneasy, and finally took the recent action of occupying Manchuria and Jehol..."</p>
<p>Among Japan's economic aggression against China, the main points are investment and market. Japan's investment in China can be divided into two major categories. One is state capital, that is, in the name of the Japanese state.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Or by directly lending money from Japanese state banks to the Chinese government, or investing in a certain enterprise, such as the 2.15 million yen Jichang Railway loan that China borrowed from Japan in 1909, and the 10 million yen postal loan in 1911, are examples of this. The second is Japanese financial capitalists, that is, those called zaibatsu by the Japanese, who invest in various Chinese enterprises, aiming to obtain various profitable rights. This capital invades our country's agricultural, forestry, commercial, mining, transportation, factory, and other enterprises. Wherever there is profit to be made, it almost penetrates without any barriers. This investment is centered on the three eastern provinces and rooted in the Yangtze River area.</p>
<p>In addition to investment, the next is market aggression. The importance of Japan's market aggression against China can be seen in the statement made by Secretary-General Tomita Kojiro at the 59th annual meeting of the Japanese Minseito, "No market is closer to Japan and more closely related than the Oriental market. However, Japan does not seem to have given due importance to the important Oriental market. Whether it is to China or to the South Seas, the majority of its exports and imports belong to European and American countries. Looking at the import trade on the Chinese side, Japan can only account for 30 percent of it, and the remaining 70 percent are not ours. Abandoning such a large adjacent market is not the way to develop Japan's national economy. Therefore, we must adopt a guiding and friendly policy to deal with the so-called Oriental markets, such as China." This shows its ambition and eagerness for market aggression against China.</p>
<p>Although the various sectors of Japan's economic aggression are interconnected and whole, each has its own means or strategies. This book has extremely detailed descriptions and disclosures about this matter. Amid the active aggression of Japanese imperialism, this book is indeed an excellent reference for understanding the methods and nature of Japanese aggression. In summary, the important features of the entire book can be divided into four types:</p>
<p>1. The actual statistics of Japan's economic aggression against China are accurate and complete, with everything that should be there.</p>
<p>2. Most of the materials taken are recent and direct materials, which are difficult to collect and are extremely valuable.</p>
<p>3. The entire book takes China as a whole as the subject of discussion, not only focusing on a part of the three eastern provinces. Wherever Japanese economic power reaches, such as the Yangtze River basin, everything is described in detail.</p>
<p>4. Equal emphasis is placed on theory and facts, using actual materials to prove the theory, and using in-depth theory to reveal the facts, without any dryness or empty talk.</p>
<h3 id="e196">History of Japanese Imperialism's Invasion of China by Ai Xuan <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>(4) The author divides Japan's invasion of China into four periods: (1) The Tentative Period (1867-1893). During this period, Japan forced China to sign several unequal treaties, namely the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1874 and the Tianjin Treaty of 1885. (2) The Incipient Period (1894-1904). During this period, Japanese imperialists greatly expanded their aggression. Our country ceded Taiwan and Ryukyu, lost Korea, and paid an indemnity of 350 million taels. The conclusion of the Boxer Protocol and the outcome of the Russo-Japanese War led to the situation where "Japanese power already dominated Manchuria, and Manchuria was in peril." (3) The Active Period (1905-1914). Japan's operations in Manchuria achieved great success due to the signing of various unequal treaties. (4) The Unbridled Period (1914-Present). Japan brazenly revealed its ferocious face, acting recklessly with the Twenty-One Demands, the Changchun Incident, the Fuzhou Incident... and the recent Jinan Massacre, as well as the current violent occupation of the Eastern Provinces, are the highest points in this history of aggression.</p>
<p>Above, the author provides a very simple explanation of the various factors in this history of aggression. Without understanding the driving forces of history, how can one understand historical facts? The author's efforts in this work are to help us understand and interpret history. This is a part that readers should not ignore.</p>
<p>The second part describes the facts of the invasion of China over the past sixty years, divided into four periods according to chronology, with detailed and concise narration. It is a very good historical resource. At the end of the book, a chapter has been added recently, namely the case of Japan's forcible occupation of the Three Northeastern Provinces, divided into the following sections: (1) The eve of the tragic incident; (2) The course of the tragic incident; (3) The process of our country's concessions and negotiations. At the end, the author said with great indignation: "I believe that since Japan is deliberately planning to permanently occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, no matter whether this case is handled by the League of Nations or through direct negotiations, there will be no good results. It can be asserted that national subjugation is near. Instead of sitting and waiting for death, why don't our 400 million compatriots bravely rise up and fight to the death with Japan? It is better to be a ghost of war than a slave of a conquered nation. My compatriots, strive for it, strive for it!"</p>
<p>"This attitude is probably the attitude of every reader. The third part is "A General Statistical Analysis of the Achievements of the Invasion of China in the Past Sixty Years." This is a horizontal record. From various statistical figures, every reader will be shocked to realize the "struggle for interests" of the imperialists. The whole article is divided into five parts: territory, military, political, economic, and cultural. Each part provides readers with many factual proofs and large numbers to prove how China is being trampled under the iron heel of Japan.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, I completely agree with the author's opinion. He said, "China can either choose not to survive, or if it wants to maintain its survival, it must rise up and overthrow the Japanese imperialists who are hindering China's survival.</p>
<p>"From the perspective of the survival of the Chinese nation, China is an oppressed nation, and Japan is the most ferocious imperialist oppressing China. Standing on the viewpoint of national equality and the requirements of national survival, we must resist Japan's oppression. We demand the freedom and independence of the Chinese nation, to liberate our nation from the layers of oppression from Japan.</p>
<p>"From the perspective of the mission of the Chinese National Revolution, imperialism is the only target of the National Revolution. If imperialism is not overthrown, the National Revolution will never be successful. The National Revolution and imperialism cannot coexist. In order to complete the National Revolution, we must also overthrow Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Only resisting Japan can save the country, and resisting Japan will surely save the country. The author explained it very clearly. I sincerely recommend this book to every reader, and I hope that every reader can learn historical lessons from this book, awaken, and be inspired.</p>
