<h3>公開會議延期芳澤訪白里安</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　芳澤將日本覆文向行政院主席說明一部份、午後四點鐘原定舉行公開會議、經芳澤要求延期、行政院所擬之决議案、業由白里安交付雙方當事國代表、據本社所知、决議案原文昨日夜間經中國代表團提出要求後、已有一項修改、行政院下次召集、似不必待至三星期之久、直接交涉一層、行政院亦不再提出建議、施博士當聲明保留、謂將研究决議案原文、一般人相信施氏非得南京許可、未便作何答覆、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　芳澤訪白里安、談二十五分鐘後、時局已倐有戲劇式之發展芳澤初抵白里安寓所時、向路透訪員言及日本答覆白里安建議之覆文、謂此覆文稍使人寛心、迨芳澤旣見白里安而出時、復語路透訪員、謂東京傳來之覆文、尙未完全、有數段尙未接到、故渠以爲宜展緩舉行今日午後之行政會公開會議云、芳澤旋返寓與其同事續商、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日覆白里安文引起不良印象</h3>
<p>五人委員會漸軟弱</p>
<p>行政會草擬决議案</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日本復白里安建議之文、不能認爲滿意、今晨五人委員會愼重考慮此復文、、歷一時一刻之久午前十一時散會後、日本態度不爲英法德意西五國委員所贊成之消息、始洩於外、午後四時將舉行行政會公開會議、公佈全部眞相、人心現大爲激奮、蓋知目前討論必有切實發展之結果也、當五人委員會散會時、候塲外探聽消息者甚衆、白里安首先由國聯秘書處步出、面有甚煩慮之色、白獨自一人退其寓所、將接見日代表芳澤、途中白語路透訪員曰、吾人尙未出荆棘之途云、其他委員相繼而出、亦各有不懌之色、空氣緊張、殆至决裂之點日本復文確已引起極痛苦之印象矣、在五人委員會集議以前、已有日本覆文殊不美滿之謠、復電深夜始到、日代表終夜從事繙譯、五人委員會初擬在白里安旅舍集議、後卒决定在國聯秘書處開會、提交行政會全體會議之最後議案、頗難着筆、昨夜已討論良久、夜深始散聞秘書長德魯蒙亦參加討論、大約與會者對於原案曾提出種種修正、聞議案中可否列入一條、請中國承認現有條約有效之問題、曾經討論、衆料此議案終不過紀錄日本撤兵之允諾、及中國願保護日僑安全之擔任、並聲明停止反日運、動以及中日開直接談判之必要而已、此議案雖規定行政會停會三星期、但大約另加但書、說明行政會雖在休會中、仍自視迄未休會如時避有召集行政會之必要、則緊急會議即可復開、中日代表團皆續接報告、滿洲現狀之電報、中代表引路透社瀋陽與北平電、並聲明中國不能在日軍佔據區域内行使其權、故無從勦匪云、日代表團所接之電、謂由朝鮮遣往滿洲之日兵、業於十月十六日調回朝鮮、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晚國聯方面對於時局抱甚嚴重觀念、傳說行政會之五人委員會、即英法意德西五國代表所組成者、處理難題、現漸軟弱、聞五人委員會欲勸中代表放棄其所執日軍須先撤退並由中立國派員監視撤軍後中日談判始可開始之條件、若此種勸告、五人委員會竟發出之、則直使日政府以城下之盟加諸中政府耳、此種感想、已引起國聯方面之甚可悲觀影響、衆慮此政策如果不變則將有大不利影響、及於將來之軍縮大會及國聯本身、國聯現所遇者固其從未有過之最嚴重時局也、此間華人深慮行政會一事無成、遽即体會、徒蹈九月三十日之覆轍、僅僅紀錄中日雙方所發願從速恢復現狀之擔保、而决定遲十四日再行集議而已、行政會現所草擬之議案、其内容度已爲日本所知者、似亦應在提交大會以前示知中代表、俾可向其政府請示應採之態度、華人方面對於國聯之未能覓取立即解决難題之辦法、深爲嘆息、截至今夜、日代表團尙未接到東京關於議長白里安提議之復電、中國代表團因陳訴案件、久無解决、漸形煩躁、施肇基博士乃於今日午後往見白里安、探詢消息、並告以中國　　迅速解决之意、但施博士所能獲聞於議長者、僅行政會現尙伺候日政府之復文耳、中國地位迄無變動、施博士始終聲明中政府須日本撤軍至鐵路區域、並允賠償華人損失、其數不妨緩日議定之、　後中國方可對日開議、據中代表所接消息、日人在其軍力保護之下現趕築吉林與朝鮮邊界間之鐵路、此綫在軍事上甚關重要、中國不欲有之、華人以爲日本延不撤兵者、其故在此、聞諸可恃方面、美國與國聯携手工作、外間所傳華盛頓另有擔保、異於日内瓦之謠言、乃不可能事美國固不能處處追隨國聯、但聞美政府準備贊同行政會模仿九月三十日辦法之决議、即規定日軍暫緩退入鐵路區域之期限是、日本復文之遲遲不到、已引起今夜日内瓦之不少悲觀、惟拋倫敦路透消息、駐英日使署對於時局、較抱樂觀日使署某員稱、現有種種解决氣象、雙方皆决心協定辦法、人人皆竭力謀取諒解云、同時此間法人方面之印象、亦較良好、白里安預料滿意之日本復文、至遲明晨可到、但即使復文不能使人滿意、行政會亦將集議考慮現已屬稿之議案、行政會冀於星期五夜閉會、定十一月中旬復開、有數方面已預定十一月十二日爲行政會下屆集議之期、今晨五人委員會在議長室開重要會議、歷一時許决定明晨舉行公開會議、屆時或將提出議案、勸令中日兩國在若干時期内互覓解决爭端之辦法、而此時期之長短、則大約可以下屆行政會集議日期表明之、五人委員會將於明晨十時半再作一度會議、雖委員會已有此决定、但各事仍視日本復文爲轉移、提交行政會之議案、其措詞如何、將視復文而定、衆望東京訓令意旨和緩、庶有在十一月中旬行政會集議以前中日協定辦法之眞正希望、但據可恃方面云、如日政府仍不改其堅强態度則限令撤兵時期、或將規定較嚴、白里安已在可能範圍内迎合日本志願、但白里安深知若讓步過多、而莫能得中代表對此提議之同意、則行政會之目的、終必歸於失敗也、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今夜滿案前途更見暗澹、中日旣各堅持不讓、白里安亦未能覓得排解糾紛之方式、五大國今夕又舉行會議、决定倘日本新訓令仍不使此案有解决之可能、則理事會將取嚴峻行動、召集公開會議、將要求日本撤兵之决議提付公决、倘芳澤依然反對、則日本將負違抗國聯責任、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日中國總代表施肇基博士鑒於理事會之决定草擬决議案、不啻爲休會三星期之準備、因此又發表聲明書聲　、該决議案内、倘含有日本撤兵將以中日兩政府在此三星期間直接外交談判爲施肇基向白里安申述中國方面之要求⊙北寗路列車昨在白廟子站遭匪截刦⊙（見國内要電法總理賴伐爾抵華盛頓⊙（見國外要電）蔣主席昨到滬與汪胡孫等會談當日返京⊙（見本埠新聞）</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>根據之意、則中國不能接受、（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　白里安業會商同寅、草擬最後决議案、即以當事雙方所提辦法爲基礎、此項决議案、對於日本承認滿洲土地完整及中國保護日本人生命財産之諾言、予以登記、並對於東京承認從速撤兵一層、加以聲叙、撤兵條文之後、緊接一條、規定三星期後召集行政院在巴黎重行開會此項會議日期、即暗合撤兵最後期限、又决議案對於與撤兵相關連各問題、勸告直接談判、决議案對於日本所謂撤兵與談判之五項主要原則、似亦注意及之、似此目今情形、實與九月間相類似、所不同者日本受有較强之壓迫、並獲有所希望之保障、而行政院認爲撤兵之事、决可按期完成耳、施博士對於决議案、不知取何種態度、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今晨五大國代表開會一小時、商定下午四時舉行理事會公開會議、下次理事會則延至十一月十二日重開、地點未定、聞今日下午將提出理事會議之决議案、大致係照會日本保證繼續撤兵、並規定理事會休會三星期、期望屆時日兵可以撤完、此項議案能否爲中國代表接受、尙在未定之天一但照例可母需一致同意、至决議案内應否規定日本撤兵日期一層、聞五大國會議時意見不一、英外相李定與西代表麥達利亞加俱不贊成、</p>
<p>（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日代表芳澤通知理事會、前自朝鮮調往滿洲境軍隊已悉數撤回原防、又據日方消息、此項軍隊四千人、旣撤回鮮境後、目下滿洲全境尙有日軍一萬四千人、與九月十九日之駐軍數額相同、又稱、日軍現除滿鐵沿線外、僅占據鄭家屯吉林與新民三處、所駐軍數共一千三百名、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯中人接滿洲又有戰事行爲消息、異常焦急、更以適在理事會準備休會之際、倍覺爲難因若處此環境下即行休會、不啻默認國聯此時無力進行調解也、各理事以日　旣正式保證撤回戰鬥飛機、乃此時復有抛擲炸彈之戰鬥機出現、尤爲驚駭、現國聯中人聲稱、理事會之行動、大半繫於日本或中國之將否激起戰爭而定、即此時理事會是否將被迫放棄休會之議、亦在不可知之數、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（南京）　日内瓦二十一日電、（一）嚴重之行政院五委員會議討論中日問題、約一小時有半、决議明日開公開會議、並提出决議案、請中日兩國在指定的時間、設法自己解决雙方糾紛、大略以下次行政院開會日期爲標準、據云將十二月中旬、（二）今晚國聯關於中日問題、形勢突變緊張、據傳行政院態度、似有軟化趨勢、有勸中國放棄開始交涉之條件說、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<h3>施肇基申述我國基本要求</h3>
<p>日軍不撤退無談判餘地</p>
<p>撤兵時由國聯派員調查</p>
<p>日本應負賠償損害之責</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　中政府對於日軍立時撤退及回復中國在滿主權之基本要求、不能退讓步、又中代表團某君語美聯社記者、理事會目下考慮之策略行將喪失中國對於國聯之善意、因其結　將使中國之内　生嚴重政治問題、致政府崩倒、即致成爲赤化、亦非不可能者今日若未能維持國聯會章與非戰公約、用公斷爲解决國際爭端工具之規定、中國國家顯將爲之削弱、倘美國未能擁護該約、則中國亦爲之削弱云云、中代表施肇基以竟日談話未有結果又致一備忘錄於白里安、重申中國之基本要求、措辭更見明晣、其内容據可靠方　傳出大致如下、（一）解决滿洲糾紛之談判、必以立即撤退日軍爲基礎、（二）當撤兵時及撤兵後、必須有一中立委員團視察、（三）必須承認中國因日本侵犯滿洲而受之損害、有要求賠償之權、（四）必須設立一中日間調和與公斷之永久機關、今中國旣明白申明其要求、則理事會勢不得不再集中力量勸誘日本方面之讓步設日本不讓步、唯有休會三星期以便從長商榷但各小國代表不贊成展期、以爲現美國旣參加、若再展期徒自喪失國聯之威望而已、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日内瓦方面之意、中國對於日本侵略土地野心、不必再懷疑懼、此蓋主要之點、本日午後白里安接見施博士、施氏極表不安、并堅稱南京方面所提條件、無可减讓、至芳澤等候東京訓令已三日於茲、尙未作答、按照國聯會盟約第十一條、即中國所根據以求直於國聯會者、行政院如欲作何决定、須以全體一致出之、白里安即引用此意、要求雙方當事採一折衷辦法、行政院若不能全體表决、自必繼續努力、務有以排除困難、但行政院討論已有九日之久、討論情形、極爲困難、各國代表多人要求迅予了結、并云中國與日本、若有一國反對、行政院即可宣告散會、而於散會之前、將多數通過之解决方案、向雙方當事國提出建議、並保留應付未來時局採取一切决定之權利、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（南京）　日内瓦二十一日電、國聯行政院、提議閉會三星期中國代表施肇基表示、略謂、若此項提議認爲在行政院閉會期中、關於撤兵事宜、應由中日兩國直接交涉、則中國不能承諾中國其他代表復稱、此種辦法即係抛棄中國方面對於國聯之正當的願望、且於政治上將發生重大影響國家對於國聯規程及非戰公約、旣不能有所憑藉則共産制度、或不免因　而流行矣、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>（南）日内瓦二十一日電、中國代表施肇基復向白里安聲明中國方面之要求、（一）撤退日軍爲交涉先决問題、（二）日軍撤退時及撤退後應組織中立調查團、（三）賠償及損害之承認、（四）中日事件永久的調解及仲裁部之設立、國聯行政院止設法使日軍撤退或至遲於三星期内撤退、國聯中各小國俱稱、若日軍不即撤退、於國聯本身極有妨礙、况美國業已參加會議、故關係尤爲重大、（二十二日專電）</p>
<h3>尊重非戰公約</h3>
<p>外部與美政府往返照會　　（南京）　駐華美國公使詹森、奉該國政府、於二十一日照會我國、請尊重非戰公約、今日外部已照復美使、表示願用和平方法解决現有之事變、茲錄雙方照會如下、</p>
<p>（一）駐華美詹使照會爲照會事、美國政府與人民、對於上月滿洲事件同深關注、當九月十八日中日間發生爭議之始、曾由爭議之一方、將此事提出國際聯合會、自此時以來、美國政府即由外交途徑之建議、與聯合會圖謀和平解决之努力共同合作、查戰爭之威脅、無論何時發生、均與全世界有深切之關係、因此美國政府、一如其　各國政府、不得不請爭議雙方、對於現在情狀所牽涉之重大危險、加以注意、</p>
<p>現本國政府一如其他非戰公約簽字各國之所爲、尤願引中日兩國政府注意各該國自願加入該約時所負之義務、而以該約第二條之義務尤應特别注意、查該條規定如左、</p>
<p>締約各國互允將各該國間設有爭端、不論於何性質因何發端、祇可用和平方法解决之、</p>
<p>茲美國政府用再表示熱誠、希望中日兩國遏止足以引起戰爭之一切措置、能同意採取一種之法則、以求用和平方法解决現在之爭端依照其所作之約言、並副全世界輿論信用之項望、相應照達貴部長查照爲荷、</p>
<p>（二）復美使照會爲照復事、中國政府接准美國政府十月二十一日來文以美國政府請中日兩國政府注意因非戰公約所發生之義務、並表示希望中日兩國避免足以引起戰爭之一切辦法等由、中國政府與人民、對於美國政府與人民、重復表示深切關注、自九月十八日以來、中國事變之發展、至爲感慰、中國政府聆悉美國政府與國際聯合會協同努力以求和平解决、尤爲欣感、</p>
<p>中國政府因絶對信賴國際公法與國際公約之原則、尤以維持國際間永久和平及尊重國家之主榷獨立與領土及行政完整之條約、所以堅忍避免施用武力、以應付日軍佔領中國領土及其他日本戰爭行爲所造成之現狀、因確信日本此種行爲、將爲關切此事之各國所不能漠視、中國政府尤忠守非戰公約所負之義務、故自此事發生之最初、即欲以和平方法、覓一公正及適當之解决、中國政府迄未採取任何戰爭步驟、而依據現有國際公約之規定、提訴於美國及國際聯合會之前、</p>
<p>中國政府竭誠願望以求各關係方面、均能得到公正待遇之担保爲條件、用和平方法解决現有之事變、並對於提倡非戰公約之美國政府、維持國際公約尊嚴之努力、當予以最充分之合作也、須至照會者、（二十二日專電）</p>
<h3>出淵在美活動</h3>
<p>美當局受其蒙蔽</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>闢日方之五項要求</h3>
<p>日來路透電通中央三處電訊。均謂日方有五項要求條件提出。目前雖尙</p>
<p>未經國聯正式决定但其已在白里安之勸告與斡旋中。進行其諱莫如深之談判已爲不可掩飾之事實。日人之欲乘此時機。滿足其無厭足之慾壑。於撤兵之先。必提出若干無理條件迫我承受。早已在吾人意料之中。獨是時至今日。外交險惡國脈已僅存一綫。我政府尙不下最後决心。貫澈歷年來所高唱革命外交之主張以决然之手叚。維護民族之生存自由。甚且於外交情勢。亦諱莫如深。不予國人以公開商討之機。自九月十八日以迄今茲。人民　於亡國滅種之慘痛。悲憤萬狀。日盼政府早定應付方針。而政府一則曰已有準備。再則曰已確定政策。徒以此緩和人心。而實則準備爲何。政策爲何。毫未有所表現使爲國家主人之國民。於當前情勢一無所曉。我國民不能不引以爲憾。　　日人五項要求之内容。「承認現有之條約權利。連同因二十一條要求而得之一九一五年條約權利一併在内。」與「中國境内各種排日形式。連抵制在内。須永遠取消」兩項。大概可以確定。此兩項條件。或者有人認爲現有之條約權利。旣已「現有。」並非「新訂。」可以承認。而取消排日形式。亦空洞無實質。不足重視皆可勉强接受。此種見解不僅爲一種似是而實非之錯誤。實爲一種賣國賣民族之行爲。存此心理者。即爲我民族之罪人我人民之公敵。　　日本與我國間之一切現存不平等條約。何一莫非以暴力威脅所訂立。其他具置勿言。民四袁世凱手訂之二十一條亡國條約。我國民早已堅决反對。誓死拒絶。日人在我全體人民堅决反對之下。至今未敢實行。在軍閥政府黑暗統治之下。人民尙以死力抗爭。不容其有此種亡國條約之存在。時至今日。而謂我素以廢除不平等條約昭示人民之革命政府。於此條約予以承認。吾人斷不敢信</p>
<p>次之。取消各種排日形式一項。自其表面觀之。雖空洞無關重要。實則此種要求最爲酷毒。夫抗暴禦侮爲一民族欲求其生存所應必具之精神。亦即立國之精神。我如承認是項要求。成爲鐵案。則將來我國之報紙敎科書以及個人之演說。爲自衞而批評日本。日人即可隨時根據條約提出抗議。於是我之敎育我之言論我之出版品。無時不遭受其箝制我欲抗暴而不可能。我欲愛國而不可得。則我巳併民族之生存。獨立國之精神。全部喪失矣喪失國土。喪失權利。都尙有收回之一日。惟喪失立國之民族精神。則我國家我民族將淪於萬刧不復。永無翻身之日。歐戰中奥大利亞迫塞爾維亞訂立慘酷之條約中。有干涉塞國敎科書内容一條塞堅决拒絶其意義即在於此。我國家今尙未至塞國當時危殆之境地也。安能舉立國精神而根本拍賣。使民族永淪地獄。故我國民尤應起而一致拒絶。</p>
<p>目前更有一般所謂「學者」「名流。」主張犧牲東北以滿足暴日之要求。解决歷來之糾紛。維護遠東暫時之和平者此種主張。更極荒謬。東北爲我國士。安能輕以予人。日人慾壑無窮。更安有滿足之日。彼佔我東北。我却犧牲東北。設彼更進而佔我平津以至京滬我爲息事寗人計亦將斷然舉以予人乎此種謬論。爲崇拜强權之媚外主義者最無恥之主張。我全體國民。亦當起而監督其發言。母使邪說流行。貽我國民以永遠之玷辱。</p>
<p>目前我全體人民敢鄭重聲言。今日之危殆情勢。實爲我民族爲爭取生存自由之最後時機。能一致抗爭。始有生存之可能。如怯弱畏縮。則亡國之禍。决難倖免。時至今日。一寸之土地。一分之權利。我國皆絶對不容放棄。我人民决不爲簽訂喪權辱國條約之民。且當以熱血作政府之後援</p>
<p>抑吾人尤有不得不向國聯敬致其忠告之忱者。吾人前已歷言目前日軍之暴行。非中日兩國局部問題。實爲關係整個世界和平之嚴重問題。參加國聯之各國政治家。外交家不應爲目前之情勢所範囿。徒仰强權之鼻息。作彌縫現狀之敷衍調停。或且偏袒强權抑制弱小。在遠東重演一亞爾塞斯羅崙之悲慘。應注目於遠處。注目於數十百年之後。使此問題得一平允合乎正義之解决。而勿增加兩國隱伏之仇恨與嫉妬。一月以來。國聯對於東北問題之處置。迄無成績。中國人民雖以此不免稍感失望。但决不因此而悲觀。中國人民。今已决定以熱血維護公理。維護我民族之生存權利。時機茲已迫近。深盼國聯於其責任與使命。作最後之努力。</p>

<h3>劉海粟歸國後報告敎育部書（五）</h3>
<p>（一）博物館之整理與建立</p>
<p>歐洲各國通都大邑鄉僻城市、皆有博物館之設立、羅致古今藝術遺品、以及名作複製、此不特提高一般人民之審美觀念、且以資學者及嗜古者之研究也關於徵集管理、已成專門科學、故凡陳設編目、缀補、儲藏、皆本精確之方法而從事、因此秩然有序、蔚爲壯觀、吾國各地有古物保存所、然皆因循苟旦、無報告無統計、其不根據科學方法也明矣、且各處古物陳列所、時有古物被竊之傳聞、尤騰笑於中外、故以現有博物院古物保存所、運用科學方法而加以整理、實爲目前急要之圖、進而擇交通便利人口繁殖之大都市、如南京上海各地、建造大規模之博物館、或就原有之保存所擴充、或開創經營以期適合現代之規模、所有儲藏、宜以珍品眞蹟爲原、則但名作不能移動而可以複製者如歷朝造像、墓闕浮雕等有關美術史者、宜聘專家爲之複製、分發各地博物館庶幾各地學者、皆得研究之便利、不致求一物而須南北奔波也、</p>
<h3>（二）民國美術院之設立</h3>
<p>歐洲各國皆有國立美術院之設置、法國之外德國普魯士邦名爲AkademiederKnust英國設皇家美術院、比利時有皇家學院之美術院、即日本亦有之、帝國美術院是也、選充著名學者名藝術家爲委員、策劃藝術敎育及藝術社會設施之方針、備國家關於藝術上之咨詢、研究美術學校音樂學校博物館所有之提議、主持國家定期美術展覽會以吸美術奬勵興廢事項、各國間雖制度不同、而用意則一也、以吾國歷史根基之深厚、待舉事業之衆多、國立美術院之設置、實不能任其缺如蓋處今日之時代凡藝術上之興舉、不能隨一人一家之興趨爲轉移、必求合於全社會整個之意向、凡有創置、必須有整個之計劃、庶可收事半功倍之效、今人動曰經濟不充、實則苟有中心機關羅致人才而爲之計劃主持、實事求是、自邇而遐、雖少許之經濟可亦成多量之事業也、若因噎而廢食、則中國文化之落後永無日以自振也、以海粟之愚、以爲藝術設施主腦、國家美術院、亦爲吾國目前急欲舉辦之一主要機關、</p>
<h3>（三）美術學校學制之改善</h3>
<p>吾國美術學校近定三年爲肄業期限、與工商實業之職業性質學校相佩、但查歐洲各國之美術學校、其目標在養成高級藝術專家、無一定年限、其研究歷程與大學相似、以海粟之經騐而論、覺美術學校性質上與其他職業性質之學校、大有區别、故三年之年限實大短促、　諸學文學哲學者、律以學普通書算簿記之年限、可不詒譏於人乎、吾國目前在過渡時代、雖不必事事求全、然關於高深學藝與普通技術之分際、不可不加明辨、美術學校方面、無論造就師資造就專家皆不能與普通職業性之技術相提並論、即爲應社會急需起見、例如關於音樂圖畫手工之師資、企其速成、略視爲同於職業性之技術外、而高深學藝、須别爲一事、不可與混、以海粟之愚、以爲美術學校肄業年限至少五年、其附屬造就師資之科系、或可稍縮、此較諸歐洲各國已屬遷就、苟念高深學藝之不可借假、苟欲學者之免於淺嘗、則學制之改善、實亦不可延緩之舉、</p>
<h3>（四）物質建設上藝術化之必要</h3>
<p>吾國近年各地建設事業、日新月異、而都市之日趨現代化、尤爲一顯著之事實、海粟旅歐期間、歷大小城市、徘徊觀瞻之下、莫不想及一地有一地之特長、此特長之顯示於人目者繫於建設上之藝術化也、建設上之藝術化、並非至難之業、要在設計者留心時代之趣味地位之形勢、布置公私建築物、作有機之統攝、避免一切不合理不規律之形式、而處處以可人悅目爲準則、不求美而自美、吾國歷來都市建設、由由外人主持、或抄襲陳章、故有不中西、非　非馬之　、今當建設過進之際、自宜注意藝術化之原則、使居民感快、觀瞻適宜、爲東方模範之區、　從事建設之當局所樂聞也、</p>
<p>海粟行裝南卸、頭　紛繁、右　大端、乃一時記憶所得、走　先陳、聊作發凡、至詳細報告以及研究心得、請稍假時日、續行整理、　政府國人共垂鑒焉、</p>

<p>日文報及宣傳之可晒</p>
<p>市公安局第六中隊警士王長興、昨晨零點一刻、被日人在竇樂安路開槍擊傷各情、已詳誌昨日本報、市政府方面、以日人任意開槍擊傷維持治安之警士、實屬有意尋釁、業已向日領署提出嚴重抗議、但此案起因、尙有爲昨報所禾詳者、特再補誌如次、當時裝載日人之汽車、其號碼爲一二六零九號、係乍浦路二九四號中山汽車行所有、事前於十一時四十分左右、獅子飯店命一中國小孩、往中山汽車行僱車一輛由車夫陸培旺駕駛、開至飯店、時有三日人上車、另四人隨之而行、繼而命車夫停車相待、時間頗久、車夫告以多停須多付錢、日人允之、後七人同上車、經東竇樂安路、向北竇樂安路進發、旋又命車夫退回、如是者三四次、行動甚爲詭秘、最後駛至東横浜路口小屋旁停車、日人出銀洋一元二角予車夫、車夫不悅、因爲時已久必須酌加詎兩日人即施毆打、車夫負痛狂奔、至距三十米處之崗位、報告警士王長順、王即隨陸前去、數日人見警士前來、突然上前圍住、其中一人向王警開槍射擊、且欲奪其所佩之盒子砲、王警爲自衞計、亦還擊一槍、行兇日人始不敢再犯、日兇手所開之槍、中王長順左手心、該警即負傷回至横浜橋隊部報急、其時適五區巡官高巡官·及派出所陳巡長·巡邏至此、亦被日人兇毆、而附近之日本陸戰隊部、已經派大批武裝日兵到場示威、旋狄思威路捕房西捕頭聞訊趕到、在地上檢獲白朗林手槍子彈壳一棵、顯係日人所放者、因王長順所佩者爲盒子砲、彈壳絶然不同也、行兇之日人一名西村千博、一名松本浩二、另一人係台灣人、名黄寛居、經捕房拘去押候訊究、惟日人松本手掌之傷痕、係從地上擦傷者、並非彈傷、自此事發生後、附近一帶居民、甚爲恐慌、羣測此種尋釁日人、必係新自大連來滬之浪人無疑、其組織每四五人爲一隊、携有手槍、專向中國人尋釁、一經發生事端、日本海軍陸戰隊即可小題大做、顚倒黑白、造成嚴重局面、以遂其破壞之毒計、且此案發生地點、在竇樂安路東横浜路口、與日本海軍陸戰隊隊部相隔甚近、其故意倒亂、更屬顯見、又訊、行兇日人西村松本及韓人、昨晨已由捕房完全釋放、市府所提出之抗議書、由俞秘書長於昨日下午送達日本領事館、</p>

<h3>中國之經濟發展</h3>
<p>共分三日　　討論、昨爲第一日、專討論農業之發展、有一組之主席在圓桌會議時、曾云希臘之文明基於奴隷、近代歐美之文明、基於機器、而中國之文明、則基於農業、華人耕田之面積殊小、逾十五英畝者、不過百分之六、三分之一、且不到一英畝、並用人力耕植、所希望生産者、爲食物與燃料、以供農民之用、中國農民約佔百分之八十、而全國之交通大多不便、中國農民之勤勉與效能、均由習俗經騐而來、殊缺乏近代之科學方法、昨日之圓桌會議、僉注意於農業敎育及農業研究、並如何實施於在農民之實際生活中、衆皆謂中國農業敎育仍在幼稚時代、但在華中·華南·華北·數處所辦敎農學校、成績斐然可觀、同時私人設辦者亦堪讚許、惟欲得農民之信仰、須有極大之技術與機智、使知種子之改良、蟲害之預防等等、皆爲彼等之利益起見、而非指導者欲藉以自利、其第一步在辦理小規模之農村放欵、以低息貸欵於農民、並贈以優良之種子、在其附近處廣騐改良種植方法、使農民目覩其成績而效法之、外人現能帮助之處、僉謂在高等敎育及研究方面、自無異議、但其實騐工作、須由華人自爲努力、例如日本在滿洲没有良好之農業試騐塲、然其農業方法尙不能影響及於三千萬在滿之華農、某華代表、謂余尙不知在滿之九十三個日本農民、已受有若何之影響、日代表則謂日人在滿殆無從事耕種者、日人用自己之方法、不克與華農競爭、在美日僑之曾習美國種殖方法者、現因受美國法律之限制、不能運用於美、但尙能在滿施用、堪與華農競爭、中國農民之借欵、利率甚高、在華中約自二分五厘至三分、在東三省高至四分、内地之借貸與償還、不用金錢者、或竟加倍取息故設立農村放欵制度以低利貸欵與農民、實爲提倡農業必要之步驟、蓋農民無欵接濟、則選種施肥之智識、全然無用、日本農村放欵之發達情形、在討論時曾作饒有趣味之陳述、在德川時代、曾組農村放欵團貸欵與出標最高之人、及至明治時代、在距今五十餘年之前、乃仿德國制設立農村放欵機關與合作社、供農民可以獲得平常資本、社會用於城市工商業之資金以應用於農業、此項放欵機關之任務、第一爲墊欵於農民第二爲合作購買用品、銷售農産、及合力租購機器等、惟日本農業、是否已達第二期、會員中不能無欵、應用於城市工商業之資本主義制度、因其能爲有價値之社會服務、以此利益、而得促進、然以之應用於農業、則將適得其反農民爲人生産食物、其社會服務愈大、則於自身愈爲不利、其趨向繁榮之途徑、似在减少此種服務、現方有一種運動、不趨向於共産主義、而趨向於類似基爾特社會主義之合作形式、在日本尤爲顯見、美國與加拿大之觀察者、對於現在應否設法增加農産一節、亦以此表示疑慮利用山地一問題、亦經討論、華代表多數認爲在目下恐不能有大進步、</p>
<p>蓋農民於食物及燃料、均須自行生産此種山地最大之利用、即在生産燃料利用山側之地、以種植果樹育蠶取絲、此方面亦已略有發展、尤其在山東省所産繭綢、即係得自橡樹者、關於整理分段制度俾可多利用機器一層、現時未能進行、中國農田、方患人工過剩、故於農作方面、無需節省人工之機器、但如灌溉用之簡單抽水機、及收割機等、儘可合作應用、分洽段最大之不經濟、即爲自甲田至乙田所耗廢之時間太多、關於灌溉問題及培植森林、控制水災等之綜合研究一節、亦經略爲討論、並有一組曾論及運輸、如鐵路之發展、與公路之需要、並採用一種汽車運輸、較標準商業汽車行駛較緩、價格較廉、而較適用於惡劣之道路云、</p>

<p>抗日之聲</p>
<p>— 芮鴻初</p>
<p>父母打兒女兒女。引身就鞭。是謂孝順。兄長責弟妹。弟妹俯首受訓。是謂尊敬。如今日本侵佔我東北。殺戳我軍民。而我國對之以不抵抗。不知此又作何稱。東北的田土。耕種不需澆肥。東北的大豆。可算世界第一。（類别近五百種）森林礦産。足供全國幾百年的需求這類東北智議。要是日本不來侵佔。像我們没錢讀書的。和讀書而專爲戀愛的人。那裏就會知曉呢。</p>

<h3>好政府最後之一幕</h3>
<p>民國十一年胡適草了一篇我們的政治主張，發表出來，列名的有王寵惠，蔡元培，羅文幹，連他自己一共十六個人。在這篇宣言裏，他們主張要樹立政府。好政府之政治改革包含三條基本原則：第一是憲政的政府：第二是公開的政府；第三是有計畫的政治。後來，王寵惠官運亨通，居然做了國務總理，羅文幹也做了財政總長。這時好人們以爲時機已熟，可以把自己的主張實行出來。大家組織了一個政治討論會，每逢星期五舉行一次。開了好幾回會，而王總理的大政方針老是不肯宣布，大家很不耐煩。一次我到北京，適逢星期五，朋友們即拉我去參加討論。我的記錄是：</p>
<p>「蔡元培」主席</p>
<p>胡適起立：</p>
<p>「根據我們的政治主張我們要請王總理宣布他的大政的方針和計畫。」</p>
<p>王寵惠登台亂七八糟說丁一大套牢騷話，足足有一個多鐘頭，最後，特别響亮的說：</p>
<p>「胡適丨你要我宣布計畫，我没有計畫丨没有計畫就是我的計畫。·····」</p>
<p>蔡元培：「我們這個討論，原來是爲着交換智識而設的。現在這樣閙意見徒傷感情，不如不開的好。如果大爱贊成，我們便從此散會。」</p>
<p>大家贊成蔡議，好政府這齣戲便從此閉幕。</p>
<h3>伍廷芳與伊藤博文</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>日本所以能夠這樣的兇横。這樣的强盛。當然要歸功於明治的維新。回想起來。我們中國在五十年前。雖是貧弱巳完全暴露。但和日本相比。還有過之無不及。可是相隔不過十年。我老大中華。竟敗於日人之手。推其原因。日本維新以後。用人得當。而中國的清政府。便不能起用人才那時中國的人才。並非没有。但西洋的留學生。回國以後。輒遭官塲的妬忌。不能起用。據說那時。有位留學生。在李鴻章手下。每月的月薪。祗有七兩紋</p>
<h3>赴國難</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>噫國運至此。但覺日暮途窮。江山盡是涕涙。起而四顧。尙幸人心不死。古語有之云。憂患可以興國。國人其能一致對外。同仇敵愾。暴日縱悍。不足慮也。余讀岳武穆滿江紅詞。每使我有勒馬關山横刀天涯之思。因覺歌詞難微。而感人實深。爰作此歌。赴國難。不容遲。有力濟以力。有資濟以資。勞力留作奴隷用。何如以與敵人决雄雌資産坐待人籍没何如急公且忘私。東北旣被掠。中原蔓又滋。如鯽兵艦來不已。江海口岸又見危。國聯會與非戰約。紙糊老虎安足期公道久巳矣。是非從何知。國家與民族。原以强力相扶持。强其智。興亡之命學問司。强其魄。興亡之運武力支。大難臨頭讀孝經。彼何人斯能通辭。赴國難。此其時。</p>
<p>赴國難。莫徘徊。忍我神明胄。辱於彼蛇虺。田横有義士。不屈殉島隈。勾踐苦其志。　差卒被摧。此心誠匪席。臨機莫疑猜或言蚩蚩者。忘國不忘財。有財家萬國。寗罹一國災。或言蚩蚩者。妄認一岑苔。中日本同種。不妨任他來。今日是何日。豈可相諉推。國人皆明哲。斷無此痴獃。我信四萬萬。同仇志不瞔敵已臨汝前。尙復自嘲詼。此輩心久死。言之良堪哀赴國難莫徘徊。</p>
<p>銀。甲午之戰。中國敗北。派李鴻章到日本馬關和議。李鴻章看見了日本實業的發達。軍備的富足。非常驚奇。在會議席上。問起伊藤。日本的進步。爲何這樣的神速。中國爲何如此落後。伊藤便回答李鴻章說。中國的貧弱不進步。因爲不能起用眞才。李鴻章回說中國人才缺少。政府本欲起用良才。奈一時難以物色。伊藤說。他從前在西洋留學的時候。有位同學呌伍廷芳。伍廷芳的學識。比他高出多多。問清政府爲何不曾起用此人。</p>
<p>李鴻章聽見了這個消息。滿肚皮摸不着伍廷芳這人的名字。後來回國以後。打聽了許多時候。才知道伍廷芳住在何處。那時伍廷芳在香港做律師。掛的是外國律師牌子。每月也可賺銀一二午兩。那時中國還没有律師。李鴻章派人到香港去請他到清庭做官。伍廷芳老是不肯。那時李鴻章許他月薪五百兩。以爲是很大了。但伍廷芳在香港所賺。還不止此數。終於由李鴻章千般設法。替他捐了官銜。派做出使大臣。即此一端。可知清庭的昏蒙。用人不當以致國弱民貧。弄到不堪設想的地步。等到起用伍廷芳。人家的文明。早已進步多多已趕不上了。這也是日本强於中國的一大原因</p>

<h3>劉海粟氏述歐遊考察藝術的感想（下）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>我在德國佛蘭克府及海台堡也開了兩次中國現代　展覽會。參觀的人非常熱烈。德國各邦轟傳一時。因此我更覺得藝術的國際酬酢。可以表現中國藝術的偉大性。是對外文化宣傳中一種很重要的問題。有一天普魯士美術院院長李培瑪·東方美術館館長寇美爾。東方美術協會會長沙爾夫博士等來訪。討論在柏林籌開中國現代畫展的辦法。最後由使館正式與東方美術會訂定於一九三四年二月舉行。由中德合辦。假普魯士美術院爲展覽地址。並推舉德方委員十人。中國方面先推定敎育部部長次長中央研究院院長駐德公使及本人等爲委員。先行籌備。其餘六人續補推。</p>
<p>那天李培瑪對我說。「前次德日合辦展覽會。日本是以帝國美術院作主體。如果下次中德合辦。中國是那一機關作主體。」我說。「中國以中央研究院爲主體」他問「普魯士美術院已有四十年的歷史。日本帝國美術院二十七年。請問中央研究院幾年。」我答「現在不過四五年。但在歷史上講有千餘年之久。因在唐宋已有國家　院的設置。」他們很熟悉中國的情形。因此更明瞭我國藝術確有悠久的歷史。他又問「下屆畫展你們有什麽畫給我們欣賞。」我答「把中國畫家自己所順意畫的畫來請貴邦藝術家指敎」意思是譏諷日本專事矯飾。作僞心勞。爲迎合歐人心理而造製的畫欺騙歐人。我們是不願意這樣做法的。李氏又說。「這話不錯。我德人所要欣賞的畫。也就是我們心裏所願意看的自然的畫。而不是專講門面爲陳列畫展而念切造作的畫。談至此。李氏囑我畫一幅淡墨山水。我便根據「氣韻生動」的意義。即席繪成。李氏仔細看了。下一個批評這。「日本畫家小寳翠靈於一個月前也曾繪一幅淡墨山水畫其魄力與氣韻差得很遠·於此我相信一九三四年的中國現代畫展一定可以給我們滿意。」</p>
<p>我在過去三年之中。綜覽歐洲各國藝術的設施。規模宏遠。意義深長。不禁低徊驚詫。迴顧我國上下數千年來。藝術業蹟的豐富。遠過歐陸。最可惜的缺乏保存發揮的方策。而埋設蓬蒿。以致今後的學者。對於前代。無從摩挲欣賞。於現代不易追踪深造。凡我藝術界同人應急起努力藝術的復興運動。</p>
<p>代爲招待。葉君係同盟會會員。光復上海時。曾率商團團員攻製造局。民元護中山先生入都就臨時大總統。功成不居。仍謀地方公益。而從事商業。見義勇爲。剛直敢言。每遇開會。演說時能侃侃而談。且寓諧於莊。故人皆悅服。雖年近古稀。而精神矍鑠。後生小子反歎不如。此次親友所贈詩文。因其爽直。故亦於祝頌中加以勉勵。茲將記憶者摘錄如下。黄炎培曰。「敵艦在門。巖疆被據。國危如今日。豈復安心祝壽之時。忠肝義膽如先生。亦復何心受祝。願拚老命。奮勇殺賊。還我河山。使五千年古國返老爲童。爾時當特進一觴。祝先生與民國同享老來幸福。吾惠鈞先生以爲保如。」潘仰堯贈以七古一首。深切時事。文曰。「倭刀濺血汚遼島。兄弟鬩牆國焉保。時危公獨挺身來。願作匡時和事老。乘槎萬里走南溟。大義當前忘鬢槁。維公初本一商人。掛名黨籍身偏早。力謀復楚效孤忠。義不帝秦甘塗腦·丈夫意氣等春雷。富貴功名視秋草。翩然初服賦歸歟。一廛依舊營粱稻。此身不欲等閒過。領袖商塲謀改造。琦行瑰意數生平。犖犖口碑常載道。吁嗟乎。國無爲寳善爲寳。天福善人增壽考。鶴齡瞬屆杖鄉期月永圓兮花永好」邵力子贈以七律一首。曰「未許雍容詠介觥。每思國難涙縱横。好憑健骨撑危局。尤有丹心籲太平。平福最先康富籌。一生奮鬭學商兵。天公應把期頣假。戮力同扶大厦傾。」</p>

<p>陶遲和同席諸人問答的時候，又來了一隊舞女，穿的花花綠綠在席前發展伊們現代舞的妙技；陶遲看的起勁，連飮了幾杯現代酒，他益發麻醉在眼前歡樂之中，他益發覺得過去的悲哀是多事，未來的希望是妄想；他祗圖着眼前的快樂，而永永在這悠久不變的現在生活中生活。</p>
<p>舞女們跳罷了現代舞，又唱着現代的歌曲：</p>
<p>丨丨現代的歌曲丨丨</p>
<p>赤日當空長繩擊，繫了重又繫；</p>
<p>過去未來都打倒，祗有現代永不變；丨丨變字叶作閉。</p>
<p>花常好，日常麗；</p>
<p>朱顔永遠是朱顔，一生笑眼常無涙丨丨丨讀作戾。</p>
<p>訪一回歌女，覓一回舞侣；</p>
<p>胡然而天？胡然而帝？</p>
<p>且以喜樂丨且以游戲丨</p>
<p>陶遲聽了這但顧目前快樂的現代的歌曲，他的魂靈兒便闖入了迷惘之宫，他彷彿見那迷惘之宫裏面，張掛着許多標語，他祇記得以下的三條：</p>
<p>「祇管現在，旁的都不要管！」</p>
<p>「朋友們，過去的恥辱不用問，未來的困難不須想，你　祇尋你現在的狂歡！」</p>
<p>「物質不滅，現在也不滅！」</p>

<h3>匯市掛牌連縮三次</h3>
<p>計縮兩檔···内盤亦緊</p>
<p>昨英美印銀市均又見跌、而匯兌續升、於是滬巾英金益形緊俏、惟美金不甚堅挺匯豐掛牌連縮三次計二檔、（英金共縮半便士、美金七五）自晨間初掛勿更、惟美金因軋滙兌故長一二五、爲卅一元八七五、其餘各匯稍有變更、至十一點半英金改縮一二五美金二五、下午二點半又縮一二五、美金二五、至三點四十分第三次改縮一二五、現爲一先令六便士八七五、美金三七五、計卅一元、其他各滙除香港始終未動、仍爲七十八兩外、餘皆改貴矣、殆内盤鬆而復緊、午後尤挺、英金結果比前午計縮三七五、美金僅縮一八七五、然金市頗多波折、前後市均有十兩廻顧、終則濳萎、實乃暴日形勢仍緊迫、國聯未有相當樂觀、且英人有提議用銀問題、因之人心徬徨不定、華商大致抛出居多、惟福昌等有所結進、以套出條子、計美金約離開卅餘兩、又孟買曾來電售出英金若干鎊計英金約共成交十餘萬鎊、美金三四十萬元、外商香蒙有所扒結、而各銀行互有出納、但市况似形複什焉、</p>
<p>英滙　内盤有半便士差額、上午出價約一先令二五買進約三七五、旋後麥行上海東亞進十二月一七五、台灣出三月一七三七五、華比進本月、大英麥加利進十二月一七五、和豐與荷囒互做本月三七五、浙江與和豐對做一月一八七五午收出價一七三一二五至二五進價三七五至三一二五、下午麥加利進一月一八七五、又進十二月一七、又出一月一七、生大與同業互做一月一七、收市出價一七零六二五至一七、買價一七·一二五至一七·零六二五、統市銀行買價最鬆一七半、最緊一七、</p>

<h3>英美銀價都縮</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀續見下游、如近期縮去二五、爲十六便士八七五、遠期亦縮二五、計十七便士、脚地中國略有　出印度少有購進、市况平穩、收市後美國甚活動故市面更形平靜、又接紐約來電、美銀價亦繼縮二五計現貨爲二角九分七五、英對美加上一分、爲三元九角五分六二五、美對英升上一分半、爲三元九角六分、英滬先令短去三七五、計一先令八便士、孟買現貨降去二十二安、那爲五十五羅比十二安那云</p>
<h3>銀拆竟達五錢</h3>
<p>市場概况　金融界緊急形勢、日趨迫促、昨市情形尤爲扼要銀拆竟至五錢、人心甚爲皇遽、縱有撑天之能、亦難補救實際就目光所及、本月内恐無轉機之望惟須强有力之勒抑、或可使銀拆回低、人心賴以安謐、苟不亟圖救濟則銀拆長此高昻、匪特無放欵可能、面本身基礎亦有可慮也、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　一洋厘一早市厘、價以銀根奇緊、乃稍回旋、收盤爲七錢二分七厘半、較前日午市小去二毫半、午市跌風尤勁爲七錢二分六厘六毫二忽半較早市遽落一厘一毫二忽半、兩市共小一厘有奇、良以銀根緊促、被壓而小也、「銀拆」早市及午市同爲五錢、較前早又高八分、而爲今年中所未多見之新紀錄、銀行掛牌二錢、劃頭加水亦有四錢以上、綜觀銀根如是緊張、金界調劑殊不易也、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　近日因銀根奇緊、輔幣交易、遂爾清淡、江南小洋兩市同爲六錢五分八厘、做出交易僅早市三千角、廣東小洋兩市亦同爲六錢五分四厘半、結果較前日亦小五六毫之譜、交易早市九萬五千角、午市亦無交易、銅元改長一千文、爲三百七十八千五百文、交易仍有三萬二千餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀欵」因銀根緊張關係、收解消息遂致冷淡、華商收解票欵二百七八十萬、外商收解票欵二百四十餘萬、各種貨滙稅雜諸欵收解七百餘萬、特欵收解一百餘萬、電匯欵五六十萬、進倉一百萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千九百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百五十餘萬、各路匯欵收解八十餘萬、解現百餘萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出一百十二萬、鈔票四萬午市匯劃票欵一百二十五萬、鈔票三萬五千、又場外鈔票早市七萬五千、午市八萬五千銀行交易早市互市五十二萬、午市互市六十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解百四十餘萬、鈔票進出二百九十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百八十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百七十餘萬拆借洋欵進出一百三十餘萬、小錢莊交易膹</p>

<h3>證劵統稅十月突跌停拍</h3>
<p>其他亦跌一元至二三元</p>
<p>人心虚弱賣出交易轉暢</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所各債券市况現貨各債券多有開出全日祇計一萬八千五百元期市以價變動較鉅、成交較前暢旺、賣買進出、頗見活潑下月期交易、亦益增多、計上午成交八百七十萬、下午五百四十餘萬元、合計一千四百十餘萬元、内除統稅佔三百八十萬元外、鹽稅二○關捲等均有一百八九十萬晨初開出時、比前日雖已趨疲、其趨勢尙穩定、上落亦屬微細、旋爲市場人心甚虚買氣渙散、而賣出咸傾向售出、遂令求供勢相懸殊、各價均下跌頗勁、步步趨疲、迄後市而跌勢猶未稍衰、内統稅十月期竟爲跌至限價停拍在收市時雖有數種稍行回高、而較前仍一致跌甚鉅、内除統稅跌四元二角半外、其下月期及鹽稅十月期二○關捲一九善等、亦多跌逾三元、其他亦小二元不等、蓋爲時局形勢、雖有進步、而國聯會消息殊屬不佳、各國僉懷觀望、對於日本之蠻横似已無法制裁、故人心復較前爲恐惶、加之現已下旬、轉瞬即届交割、目下買氣旣如是銷沉、舊多頭勢非準備收货不可、以是現金需要甚殷、連日金融情况、日益緊張、釐拆之高、爲邇所稀有凡此皆足以影響投资者之實力、故證券市面暫時仍難望有轉機、聞證交經紀人方面現方集議如何奬勵買氣辦法云債别　期現　前開　後收　較上日　成交數</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市忽轉鬆懈</h3>
<p>南頭昨西路來貨三四十號、本街重陽已、過、去化不佳、新粳白稻窰種等貨各低二三角、百哥野稻跟　近角况客帮不動照此情、形難以向上、新陳蘆洋尖存貨雖少、形勢下游、陳破襲及白元到接銷細、縮短二角光景、</p>
<p>新閘　蘇州河畔昨米情不見起色、早晨臨市人數極缺、各貨行情繫而復軟、西路到頭尙湧、人心看疲、西新窰中及埠杜尖鬆落一二角、早　稻及百哥毫無神氣、新客尖裝到有限、客帮去路略有、形勢軟弱、</p>
<h3>遠期西貢新有成交</h3>
<p>南京客秈略有到申</p>
<p>昨洋米市况、現貨因到頭甚多、進户觀望不動、故市面仍居沉寂之局、本街胃口亦淡、昨日統市祗進安南更六百包、價十二元一角七分至十二元、客秈祗有南京貨由火車裝到少數、其他均無到存、售開南京白米二百包、價九元九角、又江西機元一百五十包、價十三元二角期洋米多日未開、市面甚呆昨始有禪臣洋行抛出四月份一號西貢一千噸、英華司交貨、價五兩七錢、由本街行號收進云、</p>
<h3>標粉晨高午平</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後各月份市面亦呈暴漲之象、以洋麥報價步佳、而洋麥方面、又疑神疑鬼、謠言孔多、彷彿根本已經搖動、人心即不免震撼、故本月份最高漲至二兩零一分半十一月份至二兩零三分半、十二月份至三兩零五分、一月份至二兩零七分二厘半、二月至二兩零八分半、三月份至二兩零九分半、較前日收價、又漲二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初尙平穩、旋因多頭回出、及廠家亦一部分出檔、形勢轉和、較上午回落分餘、結果本月分較前日好五厘、十一月好七厘半十二月份好一分二厘半、一月份好一分半、二月好一分七厘半、三月份一分半云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥趨高勢</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市、面又呈近穩遠漲之象本月份以交割已迫業内外之多頭、均須了結、所以各盤交易、上落無幾、惟遠期各月份、因洋麥旣步步上漲、一般人之推想以、爲洋麥之來華、及定貨者、當不若幾月前之湧旺、并無限止之象、以此因緣、業内外人心、自然激昻、故開價亦步步高昻、結果本月份較前日好一分、十一月好六分十二月份好七分、一月份好六分二月份好四分、三月份好七分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲市仍難進展</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊絲市、仍難進展、緣紐約方面白廠經雖有進胃、而電曼絲價仍趨平疲、B級八十三分匀度來價仍祇八百四五十兩、廠方須虧本百餘兩、談判仍難就範、里昻實銷依然停滯、昨祇怡和進滬白廠經二十包、達昌等進川黄廠經二十五包公安進白乾經十包、價仍平定云、</p>
<h3>紅綠茶交易仍稀</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、仍無重大進展、英莊怡和錦隆等行、均因目前發出大批珍眉電報、尙未見覆、暫持觀望態度、全市祇杜德源生富林等行買進祁門紅茶及針眉蝦目貢熙等綠茶總計一百九十八箱、市價仍極低廉云、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉跌而復漲</h3>
<p>龍口線紛干近以走塲活潑、市價跌而復升、初價開廿三兩六錢、旋升廿三兩八錢至二十四兩、昨市更見緊秀、客貨又開出百數包、價爲二十四兩半、前後已張九兩、因此行盤隨增、而來源一時尙無大宗可到故暫難望鬆云、</p>
<h3>五金薄貨英白鐵到旺銷暢</h3>
<p>薄貨英白鐵自東貨停止來華後、本埠趨勢異常興奮、故數日來開出達六七百箱之多、惟積餘之現貨、被搜一空而後批裝到之期貨、亦大半均已抛出、價格紅烏牌每張售一兩五錢彗星牌一兩四錢七分、雜牌一兩四錢五分、（以上均三尺七尺）、而三六尺貨洋字牌售一兩三錢、三角牌一兩二錢半、雜牌一兩二錢三分、查各帮去胃推長江路爲最暢旺内河北路生意較爲少、而福建汕頭諸帮近日亦多問津、雖開出不多、但苟能匯市合算恐成交方面必興旺耳、</p>

<p>亞洲各國當今有一個大問題要去解决、這個問題是怎樣去解决人口過剩的難題目、歐洲的大不列顚·日耳曼·法蘭西和美洲合衆國、都是截然相反、人口産生率續漸减低、遠比不上亞洲、在亞洲各國中間、尤其日本的人口增加、最足令人注意、近幾年來、日本人的産生率一天高似一天、死亡率却是續漸减低、而且日本地方結婚多、離婚少、結果又是産生了許多小孩子、據目下的統計、在日本國中每一分鐘要産生四個小孩子、所以一般人預料、再歇三十年、她的全國人口一定能到一○○○○○○○○人的數目、</p>
<p>照每分鐘生産四個小孩計算、每月就要增加四三○○○人、據日本内閣統計局的公布、一九三○年十月一日、日本全國人口統計、除海外征服地不計外、共六四四五○○○五人、比了一九二五年增加四七一三一八三人、百分比率增加數爲百分之七·九、一九二五年比早五年統計、增加三七七三七六九人、百分增加數爲六·七、</p>
<p>拿日本與歐洲各國及美洲相比、情形大不相同、在最近五十年間、大不列顚·日耳曼·及美合衆國人口生産率、續漸向下低落、日本却是步步上昇、她現在的人口已與一八七零年時英國人口相同、日本常年人口增加比率數、一九三零年人口調查、每千人增加十五·三零、十年前則爲十三·十四、因之一到三十年後之一九六零年時、日本的人口就可達到一○○○○○○○○之數、她的人口就和一九二零年時的美合衆國人口相同哩、　　三十年後日本人口將達一萬萬之數、那時候人力方面她的地位將居第三、第一是美國第二是蘇俄、雖然今後是科學和機械的世界、人力兩字似乎没有多大關係、不過像日本那樣的國家、百姓肯吃苦、政府又努力、一萬萬人上下一德、她的勢力却是不能輕視的、</p>
<p>日本政府雖然表面上復有鼓勵生育、可是暗地裏許多政治家都反對生育限制、政府對於商人發售節育器具或藥品、都要取締、除非是有病的人纔可使用這種東西、那没究竟要用怎樣的法子來解决這難題呢、在表面上當然說發展國内實業、推廣海外貿易、解决那過剩的人口問題、和民生問題、可是實際上、日本三島之地、萬萬容不了潮湧般的人口生産、於是唯一方法祇有移民、第一步移民於她的征服地、像台灣高麗等處、第二步便是用暴力來侵略中國、將日本人移上東三省去、第三步那是簡實要把日本人完全移到中國來了、我們閉着眼睛想想、三十年之後日本的人口要一萬萬之數、就是要佔全中國目下人口的四分之一、可是現在中國究竟有四萬萬人麽、不、决不到這個數目、我國歷年天災人禍、民不聊民、不但人口生産一天低似一天、即以現有的數目論、死亡率比了地球上任何國家爲鉅、早已不到四萬萬之數、所以日本人生育增進、人口激增實際上能不使中國人寒心麽、</p>
<p>日本國中人口最多的城市要推大阪、那裏的人口爲二·四五三·五七三、人東京第二、計二·○七○·九一三人、這兩個大城市、因爲人口激增、便不息地向四鄉發展、東京包括郊外而言、那都會人口的繁盛、就和英國倫敦美國紐約不相上下、東京郊外不下二十一個城市、每城有人口五○·○○○人、包括於東京區内、所以區内總人口爲五·四○八·六八七人、大阪區總人口爲三·五四○·○一七人、　　日本全國人口之百分之二十四、分居一百零九個城中其中、廿八個城市、每城的居民超越一·○○○·○○○人、在近五年間又新增八個城市、每一城市的人口爲三○·○○○人、居民在五十萬以上的六大城、除大阪·東京·之外爲名古屋、九○七·四○四人、神户、七八七·六一六人、京都、七六五·一四二人、横濱六二○·三○六人、此外二十二城、每城居民均在一○○·○○○人之上、</p>
<p>日本全國人口中、其百分之五十至五十五之百姓、居住於不及一○·○○○人口之各城市中、在日本國内農夫約二七·○○○·○○○人、工人約五·○○○·○○○人、商人約八·○○○·○○○人、鄉村地方比不上鄰市富麗、</p>

<h3>水災區域裏的呼聲</h3>

<h3>The Dim Future of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Japan's Stubborn Attitude Displeases Five-Nation Representatives. The Administrative Council Drafts a Resolution on the Manchurian Incident. Wan Fulin Orders Zhang Haipeng's Troops to Retreat to Rehe. A Northern-Liaoning Train is Attacked by Bandits at the Baimiaozi Station.</p>
<h3>Public Meeting Postponed, Yoshizawa Visits Briand</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Yoshizawa explained a portion of Japan's reply to the President of the Administrative Yuan. The scheduled public meeting at 4:00 PM was postponed at Yoshizawa's request. The resolution drafted by the Administrative Yuan has been delivered by Briand to representatives of both concerned countries. According to this newspaper's information, the original text of the resolution was modified last night after a request from the Chinese delegation. The next meeting of the Administrative Yuan is unlikely to be delayed for as long as three weeks. The Administrative Yuan will no longer offer suggestions on direct negotiations. Dr. Shih declared a reservation, stating that he will study the original text of the resolution. It is generally believed that Dr. Shih cannot reply without the permission of Nanjing. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yoshizawa visited Briand for 25 minutes. The situation developed dramatically. When Yoshizawa first arrived at Briand's residence, he told Reuters reporters that Japan's reply to Briand's suggestion was "somewhat reassuring." However, when Yoshizawa emerged from seeing Briand, he told Reuters reporters that the reply from Tokyo was not complete, with several sections yet to arrive. Therefore, he believed it was appropriate to postpone today's afternoon public meeting of the Administrative Council. Yoshizawa then returned to his residence to continue discussions with his colleagues. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to Briand Creates a Poor Impression</h3>
<p>The Five-Member Committee Gradually Weakens</p>
<p>The Administrative Council Drafts a Resolution</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply to Briand's suggestion cannot be considered satisfactory. This morning, the Five-Member Committee carefully considered the reply for an hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM, news that the Japanese attitude was not favored by the British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish committee members began to leak out. A public meeting of the Administrative Council will be held at 4:00 PM to announce the full truth. Public sentiment is currently very agitated, knowing that the current discussions will surely have concrete developments. When the Five-Member Committee adjourned, many people were waiting outside the venue to gather news. Briand first emerged from the League of Nations Secretariat, looking very worried. Briand returned to his residence alone and will meet with the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa. On the way, Briand told Reuters reporters, "We have not yet emerged from the thorny path." Other committee members followed, each with an unhappy expression. The atmosphere was tense, almost to the point of rupture. The Japanese reply has indeed caused a very painful impression. Before the Five-Member Committee meeting, there were already rumors that the Japanese reply was very unsatisfactory. The reply telegram arrived late at night, and the Japanese representatives worked on translation all night. The Five-Member Committee initially planned to meet at Briand's hotel, but ultimately decided to hold the meeting at the League of Nations Secretariat. The final draft of the proposal to be submitted to the full Administrative Council was quite difficult to write and was discussed at length last night before adjourning late. It is said that Secretary-General Drummond also participated in the discussion. It is believed that those present proposed various amendments to the original proposal. It is rumored that the inclusion of a clause asking China to recognize the validity of existing treaties was discussed. It is generally expected that the proposal will ultimately only record Japan's promise to withdraw troops and China's undertaking to protect the safety of Japanese residents, as well as declare the necessity of ceasing anti-Japanese movements and opening direct negotiations between China and Japan. Although the proposal stipulates that the Administrative Council will adjourn for three weeks, it is likely that a proviso will be added, stating that even while the Administrative Council is in recess, it still considers itself not to have adjourned. If it is necessary to convene the Administrative Council at any time, an emergency meeting can be reconvened. Both the Chinese and Japanese delegations continue to receive reports and telegrams about the current situation in Manchuria. The Chinese representative cited Reuters dispatches from Shenyang and Beiping, and stated that China cannot exercise its authority in areas occupied by the Japanese army, and therefore cannot suppress bandits. The telegram received by the Japanese delegation stated that the Japanese soldiers sent to Manchuria from Korea had been withdrawn to Korea on October 16. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, the League of Nations holds a very serious view of the current situation. It is rumored that the Five-Member Committee of the Administrative Council, composed of representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain, is gradually weakening in handling the difficult issues. It is heard that the Five-Member Committee wants to persuade the Chinese representative to abandon his insistence that Japanese troops must withdraw first, and that negotiations between China and Japan can only begin after neutral countries send personnel to monitor the troop withdrawal. If the Five-Member Committee were to actually issue such a recommendation, it would be tantamount to imposing a treaty of surrender by the Japanese government on the Chinese government. This sentiment has caused a very pessimistic impact within the League of Nations. Many worry that if this policy does not change, it will have a major adverse impact on the upcoming disarmament conference and the League of Nations itself. The League of Nations is currently facing the most serious situation it has ever encountered. The Chinese here are deeply worried that the Administrative Council will accomplish nothing and will simply repeat the mistakes of September 30, merely recording the guarantees made by both China and Japan to restore the status quo as soon as possible, and deciding to reconvene in fourteen days. The content of the proposal currently being drafted by the Administrative Council, which appears to be already known to Japan, should also be shown to the Chinese representative before it is submitted to the General Assembly, so that he can consult with his government on what attitude to take. The Chinese are deeply叹息 that the League of Nations has failed to find an immediate solution to the problem. As of tonight, the Japanese delegation has not yet received a reply from Tokyo regarding the proposal of Chairman Briand. The Chinese delegation is becoming increasingly impatient due to the long delay in resolving the case. Dr. Shih Chao-chi visited Briand this afternoon to inquire about the news and inform him of China's desire for a speedy solution. However, all Dr. Shih could learn from the chairman was that the Administrative Council was still awaiting the Japanese government's reply. China's position remains unchanged. Dr. Shih consistently stated that the Chinese government requires Japan to withdraw its troops to the railway zone and agree to compensate the Chinese for their losses, the amount of which may be negotiated later. Only then can China open negotiations with Japan. According to news received by the Chinese representatives, the Japanese are currently rushing to build a railway between Jilin and the Korean border under the protection of their military force. This line is militarily important, and China does not want it. The Chinese believe that this is the reason why Japan is delaying the troop withdrawal. It is heard from reliable sources that the United States is working hand in hand with the League of Nations. The rumors circulating outside that Washington has a separate guarantee, different from Geneva, are impossible. The United States cannot follow the League of Nations in everything, but it is heard that the US government is prepared to endorse a resolution by the Administrative Council that imitates the method of September 30, which stipulates a deadline for Japanese troops to temporarily withdraw into the railway zone. The slow arrival of the Japanese reply has caused considerable pessimism in Geneva tonight. However, according to London Reuters news, the Japanese embassy in the UK is more optimistic about the situation. An official at the Japanese embassy said, "There are signs of a solution, and both sides are determined to agree on a method. Everyone is working hard to seek understanding." At the same time, the impression here in France is also better. Briand expects a satisfactory Japanese reply to arrive by tomorrow morning at the latest. But even if the reply is not satisfactory, the Administrative Council will meet to consider the draft resolution that is already in the works. The Administrative Council hopes to close the meeting on Friday night and reconvene in mid-November. Several parties have already scheduled November 12 as the date for the next meeting of the Administrative Council. This morning, the Five-Member Committee held an important meeting in the Chairman's office for over an hour, deciding to hold a public meeting tomorrow morning. At that time, a proposal may be put forward to advise China and Japan to find a way to resolve the dispute themselves within a certain period, the length of which will roughly be indicated by the date of the next Administrative Council meeting. The Five-Member Committee will hold another meeting at 10:30 tomorrow morning. Although the committee has made this decision, everything still depends on the Japanese reply. The wording of the proposal to be submitted to the Administrative Council will depend on the reply. It is hoped that Tokyo's instructions will be moderate, so that there is a real hope for an agreement between China and Japan before the Administrative Council meets in mid-November. However, according to reliable sources, if the Japanese government does not change its firm attitude, the deadline for troop withdrawal may be set more strictly. Briand has accommodated Japan's wishes as much as possible, but Briand knows that if he makes too many concessions and cannot get the Chinese representative to agree to this proposal, the purpose of the Administrative Council will ultimately fail. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, the future of the Manchurian case looks even dimmer. With China and Japan each holding firm, Briand has also failed to find a way to resolve the dispute. The five major powers held another meeting tonight, deciding that if Japan's new instructions still do not make a solution to the case possible, the Council will take severe action, convene a public meeting, and submit a resolution demanding Japan's troop withdrawal for a public vote. If Yoshizawa still opposes, Japan will bear the responsibility of defying the League of Nations. (National News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, China's chief representative, Dr. Shih Chao-chi, in view of the Council's decision to draft a resolution that is tantamount to preparing for a three-week recess, issued another statement. If the resolution contains the intention that Japan's troop withdrawal will be based on direct diplomatic negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments during these three weeks, then China cannot accept it. The Northern Liaoning Railway train was attacked and robbed by bandits at the Baimiaozi Station (see Domestic Important Telegrams). French Premier Laval arrived in Washington (see Foreign Important Telegrams). Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai yesterday and met with Wang, Hu, Sun, etc., returning to Nanjing on the same day (see Local News).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(National News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Briand has consulted with his colleagues and drafted a final resolution based on the methods proposed by both parties. This resolution registers Japan's recognition of Manchuria's territorial integrity and China's promise to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, and also articulates Tokyo's acknowledgment of withdrawing troops as soon as possible. The troop withdrawal clause is immediately followed by a clause stipulating that the Administrative Yuan will reconvene in Paris in three weeks. The date of this meeting coincides with the final deadline for troop withdrawal. The resolution also recommends direct negotiations on issues related to troop withdrawal. The resolution seems to have taken into account Japan's so-called five major principles of troop withdrawal and negotiation. The current situation is similar to that in September, except that Japan is under greater pressure and has obtained some hoped-for guarantees, and the Administrative Yuan believes that the troop withdrawal can definitely be completed on schedule. It is not known what attitude Dr. Shih will take towards the resolution. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, representatives of the five major powers met for an hour and agreed to hold a public meeting of the Council at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The next Council meeting will be postponed to November 12, with the location yet to be determined. It is heard that a resolution of the Council will be presented this afternoon, roughly a note to Japan guaranteeing continued troop withdrawal and stipulating that the Council will recess for three weeks, hoping that Japanese troops can be withdrawn by then. Whether this proposal will be accepted by the Chinese representative is still uncertain. However, as a rule, unanimous agreement is not required. As for whether the resolution should stipulate the date of Japan's troop withdrawal, opinions differed during the meeting of the five major powers. British Foreign Secretary Reading and Spanish representative Madariaga both disagreed. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Yoshizawa informed the Council that all troops previously transferred from Korea to Manchuria have been withdrawn to their original defense positions. According to Japanese sources, after these 4,000 troops were withdrawn to the Korean border, there are currently 14,000 Japanese troops in Manchuria, the same number as the garrison on September 19. It is also stated that Japanese troops are currently occupying only Zhengjiatun, Jilin, and Xinmin, in addition to the South Manchurian Railway zone, with a total of 1,300 troops stationed there. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations are extremely anxious about the news of renewed hostilities in Manchuria, and feel especially troubled as it comes at a time when the Council is preparing to recess. If the recess were to proceed under these circumstances, it would be tantamount to tacitly acknowledging the League of Nations' inability to mediate at this time. The council members are particularly alarmed that fighter planes dropping bombs have reappeared after Japan had formally guaranteed to withdraw combat aircraft. It is now claimed in the League of Nations that the Council's actions largely depend on whether Japan or China will provoke a war. It is also unknown whether the Council will be forced to abandon the recess at this time. (National News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Geneva dispatch, 21st: (1) A serious meeting of the Administrative Council's Five-Member Committee discussed the Sino-Japanese issue for about an hour and a half, deciding to hold a public meeting tomorrow and submit a resolution, requesting China and Japan to find a way to resolve their disputes themselves within a specified time, roughly based on the date of the next Administrative Council meeting, said to be in mid-December. (2) Tonight, the situation regarding the Sino-Japanese issue at the League of Nations suddenly became tense. It is reported that the attitude of the Administrative Council seems to be softening, with some saying that China should be persuaded to abandon the conditions for starting negotiations. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Shih Chao-chi States Our Country's Basic Demands</h3>
<p>No Room for Negotiation Without Japanese Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>League of Nations Personnel to Investigate During Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Japan Should Be Responsible for Compensating for Damages</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government cannot compromise on its basic demands for the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops and the restoration of Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria. A gentleman from the Chinese delegation told an Associated Press reporter that the strategy currently being considered by the Council will lose China's goodwill towards the League of Nations, because its outcome will cause serious political problems within China, leading to the collapse of the government, and even possibly leading to communism. If the League of Nations Charter and the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which use arbitration as a tool to resolve international disputes, fail to be upheld today, China's national strength will be weakened. If the United States fails to support the pact, China will also be weakened. After not achieving any results from all-day talks, Chinese representative Shih Chao-chi sent another memorandum to Briand, reiterating China's basic demands in clearer terms. According to reliable sources, the content is roughly as follows: (1) Negotiations to resolve the Manchurian dispute must be based on the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops. (2) A neutral commission must inspect during and after the troop withdrawal. (3) China must be acknowledged to have the right to demand compensation for damages caused by Japan's invasion of Manchuria. (4) A permanent Sino-Japanese conciliation and arbitration body must be established. Now that China has clearly stated its demands, the Council must concentrate its efforts to persuade the Japanese side to make concessions. If Japan does not make concessions, the only option is to adjourn for three weeks to discuss the matter at length. However, representatives from small countries do not agree with extending the deadline, believing that since the United States has already participated, further extension would only damage the prestige of the League of Nations. (National News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The consensus in Geneva is that there is no need to harbor any further doubts about Japan's ambition to invade and occupy land, which is the main point. This afternoon, Briand met with Dr. Shih, who expressed great unease and insisted that the conditions put forward by Nanjing were not negotiable. Yoshizawa has been waiting for instructions from Tokyo for three days and has not yet replied. According to Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, which China is relying on to seek justice from the League of Nations, any decision made by the Administrative Council must be unanimous. Briand quoted this meaning, requesting both parties to adopt a compromise solution. If the Administrative Council cannot vote unanimously, it will continue its efforts to overcome the difficulties. However, the Administrative Council has been discussing for nine days, and the discussions have been extremely difficult. Several representatives have requested a quick resolution, saying that if either China or Japan objects, the Administrative Council can declare an adjournment, and before adjourning, it will propose a solution passed by a majority vote to the two concerned countries, and reserve the right to take all decisions to deal with the future situation. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Geneva dispatch, 21st: The Administrative Council of the League of Nations proposed to adjourn for three weeks. Chinese representative Shih Chao-chi stated that if this proposal is considered to mean that China and Japan should negotiate directly on the matter of troop withdrawal during the recess of the Administrative Council, then China cannot agree. Other Chinese representatives added that this approach abandons China's legitimate hopes for the League of Nations and will have a major political impact. If the country cannot rely on the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then the communist system may spread as a result. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(South) Geneva dispatch, 21st: Chinese representative Shih Chao-chi reiterated China's demands to Briand: (1) Withdrawal of Japanese troops is a prerequisite for negotiations. (2) A neutral investigation team should be organized during and after the withdrawal of Japanese troops. (3) Recognition of compensation and damages. (4) Establishment of a permanent mediation and arbitration department for Sino-Japanese affairs. The League of Nations Administrative Council is trying to find a way to withdraw Japanese troops, or at least withdraw them within three weeks. Small countries in the League of Nations all say that if Japanese troops are not withdrawn immediately, it will be extremely detrimental to the League of Nations itself. Moreover, since the United States has already participated in the meeting, the relationship is even more significant. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Respect the Kellogg-Briand Pact</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Exchanges Notes with the US Government (Nanjing) US Minister to China, Johnson, was instructed by his government to send a note to our country on the 21st, requesting respect for the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to the US Minister, expressing its willingness to resolve the current incident through peaceful means. The notes from both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Note from US Minister to China, Johnson: Regarding the matter of the note, the US government and people are deeply concerned about the Manchurian incident last month. When the dispute between China and Japan began on September 18, one of the parties to the dispute submitted the matter to the League of Nations. Since then, the US government has cooperated with the League's efforts to seek a peaceful resolution through diplomatic suggestions. The threat of war, whenever it occurs, is of deep concern to the entire world. Therefore, the US government, like other governments, cannot but ask the parties to the dispute to pay attention to the serious dangers involved in the current situation.</p>
<p>Now, the national government, like other signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, especially wishes to draw the attention of the Chinese and Japanese governments to the obligations they assumed when voluntarily joining the pact, and the obligation under Article 2 of the pact should be given special attention. This article stipulates as follows:</p>
<p>The contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.</p>
<p>The US government hereby reiterates its sincere hope that China and Japan will restrain all measures that could lead to war, and can agree to adopt a principle to seek a peaceful resolution to the current dispute in accordance with their pledge and the expectations of world opinion. It is appropriate to notify your Minister for reference.</p>
<p>(2) Reply to the US Minister's Note: Regarding the reply, the Chinese government received the US government's letter of October 21, stating that the US government requested the Chinese and Japanese governments to pay attention to the obligations arising from the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and expressed the hope that China and Japan would avoid all measures that could lead to war. The Chinese government and people are deeply moved by the repeated expression of deep concern from the US government and people. The Chinese government is particularly pleased to learn that the US government is working with the League of Nations to seek a peaceful resolution since the development of the Chinese incident on September 18.</p>
<p>The Chinese government, trusting absolutely in the principles of international law and international conventions, especially treaties that maintain permanent peace among nations and respect national sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, has patiently avoided the use of force to cope with the current situation caused by the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory and other Japanese acts of war. Believing that these actions by Japan will not be ignored by the countries concerned, the Chinese government is particularly loyal to the obligations assumed under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, from the very beginning of this incident, it has sought a just and appropriate resolution through peaceful means. The Chinese government has not taken any war-like steps and has filed a lawsuit with the United States and the League of Nations in accordance with the provisions of existing international conventions.</p>
<p>The Chinese government sincerely hopes to resolve the current incident through peaceful means, with the guarantee that all relevant parties can be treated fairly, and will provide the fullest cooperation to the US government, which promotes the Kellogg-Briand Pact, in its efforts to maintain the dignity of international conventions. It is necessary to inform you, Minister. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Debuchi's Activities in the United States</h3>
<p>US Authorities Deceived by Him</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Debuchi is quite active here, frequently visiting the US State Department. Today, he told Stimson that Japan has formally returned the municipal administration of Shenyang to Chinese officials, and that all Japanese who managed the city's affairs after September 18 have resigned and withdrawn. The Chinese Embassy immediately declared that China had not received formal notification of the return of Shenyang's political power to the Chinese, nor had it heard of such a move. Later, people in the State Department, regarding the conflicting statements from China and Japan, said that the public could judge for themselves the truth of the matter. People in the State Department also said after Debuchi visited Stimson that there was progress in the mediation of the Manchurian case. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Turkey Advises the Chinese and Japanese Governments</h3>
<p>To Abide by the Clauses of the Kellogg-Briand Pact (Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras, asking China and Japan to pay attention to the responsibilities they should bear under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The general idea is that since September 18, the situation in Manchuria has suddenly become tense. The Turkish government is paying close attention, and the League of Nations Administrative Council has accepted the case and is trying to resolve it. The Turkish government is also cooperating in its efforts. Both China and Japan are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact of August 27, 1928, and all disputes should be resolved through peaceful means. World opinion hopes that both countries will abide by the clauses of the pact. The national government is confident that the Chinese and Japanese governments will not disappoint the people of the world. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Adds to Arms Shipments</h3>
<p>To Strengthen its Aggression in Manchuria</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is now learned that the Ministry of the Army has decided to continue shipping machine guns and infantry rifles to Manchuria to strengthen the defense of Japanese soldiers, because the Japanese government opposes increasing the number of soldiers in Manchuria.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Concerning Japan's Five Demands</h3>
<p>Reuters and the Central News Agency's Third Bureau have reported in recent days that Japan has presented five demands. Although these demands have not yet been formally decided upon by the League of Nations, it is an undeniable fact that they are being negotiated under the advice and mediation of Briand, in a manner shrouded in secrecy. It was already expected that the Japanese would seize this opportunity to satisfy their insatiable greed and, before withdrawing their troops, would present unreasonable conditions to force us to accept. The only thing is that, even now, with the country's diplomatic situation perilous and its very existence hanging by a thread, our government still hasn't made a final decision. It has not thoroughly implemented the revolutionary diplomacy it has been advocating for years, nor has it taken decisive measures to protect the nation's survival and freedom. Furthermore, it keeps the diplomatic situation secret, denying the people an opportunity for open discussion. Since September 18th until now, the people have been filled with grief and indignation at the tragedy of national subjugation and extermination. They have been hoping that the government would quickly determine a course of action. However, the government has merely said, "We are prepared," and "We have a definite policy," to appease the people. In reality, what is the preparation? What is the policy? Nothing has been demonstrated, leaving the citizens, who are the masters of the country, completely ignorant of the current situation. Our people cannot but feel regret.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of Japan's five demands, the two items that can be considered certain are: "Recognition of existing treaty rights, including the treaty rights obtained through the Twenty-One Demands in 1915," and "All forms of anti-Japanese activity within China, including boycotts, must be permanently abolished." Some people may think that existing treaty rights are already "existing" and not "newly established," so they can be recognized. They may also believe that abolishing anti-Japanese activities is empty and without substance, and therefore can be reluctantly accepted. Such a view is not only a specious error but also an act of selling out the country and the nation. Those who harbor this mindset are the criminals of our nation and the public enemies of our people.</p>
<p>Every single one of the existing unequal treaties between Japan and our country was established through violence and threats. Other matters aside, the Twenty-One Demands, a treaty that would have subjugated our nation and was personally signed by Yuan Shikai in 1915, has long been resolutely opposed and rejected by our people. Even under the resolute opposition of our entire population, the Japanese have not dared to implement it to this day. Under the dark rule of the warlord government, the people still resisted with all their might, refusing to allow the existence of such a treaty that would destroy the country. To think that today, our revolutionary government, which has always declared to the people its commitment to abolish unequal treaties, would recognize this treaty... we dare not believe it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the item about abolishing all forms of anti-Japanese activity, while seemingly empty and unimportant on the surface, is actually the most insidious of all. Resisting tyranny and defending against aggression is a spirit that a nation must possess in order to seek its survival; it is also the spirit upon which a country is founded. If we recognize this demand and it becomes an ironclad case, then in the future, if our country's newspapers, textbooks, or individual speeches criticize Japan in self-defense, the Japanese can lodge protests at any time based on the treaty. As a result, our education, our speech, and our publications will be constantly subjected to their control. We will be unable to resist tyranny, and we will be unable to love our country. Then we will have lost the very survival of our nation and the spirit of an independent country. Losing territory and losing rights can still be recovered one day. However, if we lose the national spirit upon which our country is founded, then our country and our nation will be plunged into eternal ruin, with no chance of recovery. During the European War, Austria forced Serbia to sign a cruel treaty that included a clause interfering with the content of Serbian textbooks. Serbia resolutely rejected it, and its significance lies in this. Our country has not yet reached the critical situation that Serbia was in at that time. How can we fundamentally sell off the spirit upon which our country is founded and plunge our nation into eternal hell? Therefore, our people should rise up and reject it unanimously.</p>
<p>Currently, there are some so-called "scholars" and "celebrities" who advocate sacrificing the Northeast to satisfy the demands of the tyrannical Japanese, resolve past disputes, and maintain temporary peace in the Far East. This kind of advocacy is even more absurd. The Northeast is our country's land; how can we lightly give it away to others? The Japanese have insatiable desires; how can they ever be satisfied? They occupy our Northeast, and we sacrifice the Northeast. Suppose they further advance and occupy our Tianjin, and even Beijing and Shanghai; for the sake of appeasement, are we going to resolutely offer them up as well? This kind of absurd theory is the most shameless advocacy of foreign worship by those who admire power. All of our citizens should also rise up to monitor their speech, preventing heretical views from spreading and causing eternal shame to our people.</p>
<p>Today, all of our people dare to solemnly declare that the current perilous situation is indeed the last opportunity for our nation to fight for its survival and freedom. Only by fighting together can there be a possibility of survival. If we are timid and shrink back, then the disaster of national subjugation will be difficult to avoid. At this point in time, not an inch of land or a fraction of rights can we allow to be given up. Our people will never be people who sign treaties that forfeit rights and humiliate the nation, and we must use our blood as support for the government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must sincerely offer our advice to the League of Nations. We have already stated that the current atrocities of the Japanese army are not just a local issue between China and Japan; they are a serious issue that concerns the peace of the entire world. The politicians and diplomats of the countries participating in the League of Nations should not be limited by the current situation. They should not simply look to the powerful, make superficial adjustments to mediate the current situation, or even favor the powerful and suppress the weak, repeating the tragedy of Alsace-Lorraine in the Far East. They should look to the distant future, to decades or even hundreds of years from now, and ensure that this issue is resolved fairly and justly, without increasing the hidden hatred and jealousy between the two countries. For a month, the League of Nations has made no progress in dealing with the Northeast issue. Although the Chinese people cannot help but feel somewhat disappointed by this, they will never be pessimistic because of it. The Chinese people have now decided to use their blood to defend justice and the right of our nation to survive. The time is pressing, and we deeply hope that the League of Nations will make a final effort to fulfill its responsibility and mission.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Foreign sources receive a telegram from Shenyang that the Mongols connecting with the Taonan area have always obeyed China and have little faith in the Japanese.

<h3>Ma Longtan Relies on Japanese Power to Shamelessly Proclaim Sino-Manchu Independence</h3>
<p>Organizing the So-Called Independent Autonomous Association</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Longtan, the former supervisor of the Siping-Taonan Railway, is relying on Japanese power in Changtu to organize the Sino-Manchu Independent Autonomous Association, including the four counties of Lishu, Liaoyuan, Huaide, and Kaiyuan. It was established on the 20th and issued an absurd declaration, saying: "Since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred, the Northeast government has been destroyed, the military and police have scattered, rumors have spread, bandits have run rampant, and soldiers have turned into bandits. It is often heard that the people have lost their wealth and homes and are suffering in misery. The chaotic situation is truly unbearable to witness. Now, fortunately, with the cooperation and support of the gentry and people of Changtu, Lishu, Liaoyuan, Huaide, and Kaiyuan counties, the Sino-Manchu Joint Independent Autonomous Association has been established, and all political organs have been re-established. I, Ma Longtan, have received the mandate of heaven and responded to the wishes of the people. I uphold the great mission of the Red Swastika Society and the spirit of love and kindness of all mankind in the world. My highest goal is to build a paradise of Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, I declare the Sino-Manchu Joint Independent Autonomous Association, and I hope that people from all walks of life will take note." (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Transport Zhang's Private Belongings to Tanggu</h3>

(Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Honjo previously sent military attache Major Nagatsu to Beiping to visit Zhang and transport Zhang's private property.

(2) The Japanese army is rushing to build barracks in Julu, which can accommodate a thousand people. They are also building trenches and defensive works near Julu, intending to build gun emplacements and install four heavy artillery pieces. At night, the Japanese army has foot patrols in the field.

<h3>Trends in British and French Newspapers</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the British newspapers all expressed anxiety, fearing that the League of Nations Administrative Council would implement its opinion of abandoning the Manchurian problem. The Liberal Party's Daily News asked Briand and Litvinov to stay in Geneva to save the League of Nations' crisis. The Times' Geneva correspondent made a fair and impartial comment today, saying that if the international community does not use the precedent of 1926 applied to Greece and Bulgaria to put pressure on both sides and send neutral personnel to monitor the situation on the ground to ensure the effectiveness of its pressure, then the Sino-Japanese conflict will have almost no chance of resolution. The League of Nations should assume this responsibility and assist Japan and China in reaching an agreement on the conditions for troop withdrawal. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers believe that the Administrative Council will be able to conclude everything today. Their opinions on the real achievements of the Administrative Council are very different. Several newspapers seem to fear that the Administrative Council will not be able to reach a positive solution this time. Several other newspapers believe that it would be most convenient for the Administrative Council to extend the meeting for three weeks. However, the date of the reconvening of the Administrative Council must coincide with the date of Japan's complete withdrawal of troops from Manchuria. "Paris Echo" stated that Shi Zhaoji declared again to Briand that China cannot accept any decision that is contrary to the principles contained in the Chinese Memorandum. "Le Petit Parisien" said that if Shi Zhaoji does not completely change his mind, then the Administrative Council will be able to obtain China's consent. In short, whether the Administrative Council obtains complete understanding or only an agreement with conditions that will be further detailed later, its meeting will adjourn or suspend on Saturday. If it is the second result, then the Administrative Council will entrust Briand to monitor the development of the situation and take all the measures proposed by the League of Nations Covenant and the Basic Charter. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Absurd Declaration by Japanese Minister of Finance Inoue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A message from Tokyo on the 21st said that because Japanese bonds and the price of Japanese currency have fallen sharply in foreign markets since the Manchurian incident, Japanese Minister of Finance Inoue, with the consent of the Japanese cabinet on the afternoon of the 20th, issued a declaration saying that anyone familiar with the recent Manchurian incident knows that the Japanese army is acting entirely in self-defense. Japan obtained the police power in the South Manchuria Railway area from the Russo-Japanese Treaty of 1905, and this treaty was recognized by China. This situation is exactly the same as the United States having police power in the Panama Canal area, etc. Inoue issued this declaration in order to mislead the world and deliberately compared the situation with the United States in Panama. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially consulted a famous figure in diplomatic circles and asked for his views. According to him, Inoue's actions can be described as completely sophistry. Although the 1905 treaty recognizes the Japanese government's right to protect the South Manchuria Railway, it is by no means unrestricted deployment of troops. As for occupying Chinese cities and disarming the Chinese army because of the South Manchuria Railway, it is definitely not permitted by the treaty. Moreover, the scope of the Japanese army's occupation this time, including the northwest and Liaoyuan and Taonan, and the northeast and Jilin and Dunhua, is thousands of miles away from the South Manchuria Railway and has nothing to do with the 1905 treaty. Although the Japanese want to shirk responsibility through sophistry, the countries of the world will definitely not be deceived. To draw a comparison with the United States is even more inappropriate. Although the management right of the Panama Canal is in the hands of the United States, has the United States ever sent troops to occupy Panamanian territory? This further proves that the Japanese side is wrong. (Central News Agency Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>1929 Soviet Document to the United States</h3>
<p>Japan Is Engaged in Research</p>
<p>(Moscow) A message received here from Geneva states that Japan is currently studying the reply of Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov to US Secretary of State Stimson during the 1929 Sino-Eastern Railway dispute. Today, the newspapers have many comments, such as the Central Executive Committee's official newspaper, which said that Japan should study all of the Soviet Union's actions during the Sino-Eastern Railway dispute. If so, Japan will know that the Soviet Union's policies are completely different from Japan's imperialist policies. (National News Agency Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Gansu is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The situation in Gansu is again becoming increasingly serious. It is widely rumored that Ma Lin, Chairman of Qinghai Province, will use armed forces to mediate the Gansu affair.

<h3>More Than One Million Tons of Japanese Ships are Laid Up Amidst Anti-Japanese Sentiment</h3>
<p>Small and Medium-Sized Industries are Shutting Down One After Another</p>
<p>Labor Disputes are Rapidly Increasing</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd - Due to the depreciation of the British pound, the Japanese shipping industry is finding it impossible to make ends meet on long-distance voyages. Therefore, all ships are being used on coastal routes. However, there are too many ships in the inland sea, and exports have declined due to the Chinese insistence on anti-Japanese sentiment. More than one million tons of ships have been laid up, causing great panic among small-capital shipping companies.</p>
<p>The World Society reported, according to the Dongbao, that Osaka Prefecture, which is known as the number one in trade with China, has seen a shocking number of small and medium-sized industrialists shut down factories due to the stagnation of exports to China after the Eastern Provinces Incident and the intense anti-Japanese sentiment. Therefore, in the first 14 days of October alone, there were an average of two or three labor disputes per day. There are more than 40 disputes currently in progress, such as the Ito Enamel Company in Izumio Hirao Street, Osaka Lane. Police Officer Itano of the Special Higher Police Section of the Osaka Prefecture and other staff members are extremely busy. The factories that have fallen into this tragic situation specialize in glass, enamel, umbrellas, and other miscellaneous goods, with small and medium-sized industries employing 40 to 200 workers. At the same time, about 800 weaving factories of all sizes in the Izumi North and West Counties, the origin of Izumi textiles, are also in the same predicament. In particular, the cotton and woolen cloth and towel factories have seen a rapid succession of closures recently. For example, the cotton and woolen cloth weaving industry association in the jurisdiction of the Otsu Police Station decided on the 14th to suspend work for half a month each in October and November. The future direction is still uncertain. Furthermore, after discussions, the Izumi North Textile Industry Association of Sano mostly advocates suspending work or reducing production by 25%.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Confess the Truth About Bombing Jinzhou</h3>
<p>The Bombing of Jinzhou Was Ordered by Honjo</p>
<p>The Targets for Bombing Were All Predetermined</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication - The incident of Japanese military aircraft bombing Jin County has attracted worldwide attention. According to a conversation with someone who returned to Tianjin from Shenyang yesterday, on the 9th of this month, the Manchuria Daily published an account by Major Yokota of the Japanese Army, who led the Japanese air squadron that bombed Jinzhou, revealing the beginning and end of the bombing, which is tantamount to a confession of a planned atrocity by the Japanese army. Unfortunately, the Manchuria Daily was confiscated by the Japanese military authorities and was not allowed to be published, so outsiders rarely see it. The main points of Yokota's statement in the newspaper are as follows: "Our bombing of Jinzhou this time was all in accordance with a prior explicit order. This order was issued before the Japanese government announced that Chinese people had attacked Japanese troops. We were originally stationed in Changchun and suddenly received an order to transfer to Shenyang. We didn't know what was going on, so the four aircraft in Changchun flew to Shenyang. After arriving in Shenyang, we received another order to combine with the eight aircraft in Shenyang, forming a temporary air squadron of twelve aircraft. Then, the squadron was divided into four teams of three aircraft each. Before the flight, the Kwantung Army Command gave us a map and designated four bombing destinations: Zhang Zuoxiang's residence, Jin County Jiaotong University, and two large camps of the Jin County garrison. After flying to Jinzhou, I dropped a total of eight bombs within fifteen minutes. The last bomb landed on the roof of Zhang Zuoxiang's residence," and so on. It was also stated that inspections are now extremely strict in Shenyang. Newspapers, photo studios, post offices, telegraph offices, and telephone offices are thoroughly inspected by the Japanese every day. Residents of Shenyang are also frequently inspected. This work is carried out by Japanese veterans in cooperation with regular soldiers. Many Japanese who have exceeded the age limit for veterans have also joined the effort. The Japanese army also led about thirty workers at 7:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month to completely dismantle the No. 1 and No. 3 intersections on the west end of the Dabeimen Railway Station in Shenyang, and removed about 200 feet of track. They then laid a new track from the intersection of the No. 3 intersection, connecting it to the joint transport line of the South Manchuria Railway. It has been completely completed. For several days, South Manchuria Railway locomotives have been pulling several empty cars, passing from the South Manchuria Railway through the Shenhai-South Manchuria joint transport line, passing the newly laid track, passing the East Station of Dabeimen and turning onto the branch line of the Beining Railway's arsenal, heading directly to the arsenal to load the military equipment stored in the factory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Incitement of Illegal Organizations Intensifies</h3>
<p>Establishing the So-Called Sino-Manchurian Province</p>
<p>Promoting a Small-Scale Autonomy Movement</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Japan occupied various areas of Liaoning and Jilin, it has been actively inciting their independence. Recently, realizing that a comprehensive movement is difficult to achieve, they have shifted to a so-called "small-scale autonomy" strategy, starting from individual counties. They have already carved out six counties—Lishu, Changtu, Kaiyuan, Huai'de, Tongliao, and Liaoyuan—from Liaoning Province to establish a separate Sino-Manchurian Province. The inherent territory of these six counties forms the province's domain, with Sipingjie as its capital. Kan Chaoxi's younger brother, Kan Chaoshan, has been appointed as the chairman of the Sino-Manchurian Province. He is currently visiting various counties to take over. Kan Chaoshan also serves concurrently as the chairman of Lishu County. Meng Zhongwen and Han Yinjie have been appointed as vice-chairmen. Li Ziyu, Zhu Shi'en, Liu Jingpu, a Mr. Dong, a Mr. Li, Yang Zhuchen, Wang Ji'an, Wang Gan'chen, Shi Youshan, Bi Huaxuan, Yue Junwu, Song Yindong, Li Yinsan, Fan Daquan, Zhang Shaowei, and twenty-one others serve as committee members, implementing the so-called autonomy system. Sipingjie has also been renamed as a city, with Kan Chaoshan concurrently serving as its mayor. Furthermore, Fushun and Tieling have also announced their autonomy one after another. Fushun began implementing autonomy on October 11th, with Xia Xuan as the chairman of the People's Autonomy Association, Liu Hanqing as the vice-chairman, and Jia Hanqing, He Xizhuo, and Sun Zhenkui as committee members. Tang Zhiming serves as the executive committee member. Japanese individuals, Yamaguchi Fumio and Komi Kaoru, have been hired as advisors. At noon on that day, the words "Fushun County People's Autonomy Association" were prominently written on the walls of the Fushun County Office. A yellow flag was raised, and a declaration and proclamation regarding the establishment of the autonomy association were distributed, stating that "The Fushun County People's Autonomy Association, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people and ensure their right to survival, hereby abolishes the local system of military dictatorship and county administration. A new people's autonomy, based on the traditional clan system of Chinese society, is hereby declared to administer local affairs." In Tieling, the existing Tieling County Government was abolished on the 9th of this month, and the sign of the Liaoning Province Autonomy Association was displayed. Simultaneously, influential officials and civilians within the city were convened to begin organizing an autonomous association, issuing a declaration stating, "This autonomy association, for the benefit of the people, abolishes the county government, the ruling apparatus of the old warlords, and restores the traditional Chinese autonomous system." Former county magistrate Yu Rongqing was appointed as the chairman, former public security chief Zhang Zuyin as the vice-chairman, former agricultural association chairman Yu Pan, vice-chairman Shi Jikui, former commerce association chairman Chang Yudong, former education bureau chief Zheng Lu, former diplomatic secretary Lin Shuzhi, Fu Wenhua, the head of Fuhe Hospital, and Zeng Qingchen, Wu Guihua, Shi Zhizhang, Wei Laige, Wang Zhegui, Yang Xuan, Hu Shixing, Deng Shiren, Fang Zuoqing, Wang Yuheng, Zhang Xulai, Yang Chunlin, Zheng Shizhang, Zeng Zhaoming, Huang Enhou, and Wu Changan serve as committee members. Yu Rongqing, Zhang Zuyin, Chang Bangdong, Yu Pan, Zheng Lu, Lin Shuzhi, Fu Wenhua, Shi Zhizhang, Yang Xuan, Hu Shixing, Deng Shiren, and Wu Changan serve as the executive committee members of Tieling. Japanese individuals, Kito Yoshiya (of the Commerce Association), Nishio Shin (chief of the People's Association), Misuhiro Eiji (vice-chairman of the South Manchurian Railway Local Committee), Yamada Keizo (vice-chairman of the Commerce Council), and Sato Fukujiro (specialty products merchant), have been hired as advisors. The so-called "small-scale autonomy" movement has already emerged in various counties of Liaoning, and Japan's incitement efforts have gradually succeeded. It is lamentable that there are so many Chinese Li Wanyongs. It is hardly surprising that a country with so many traitors will not perish.</p>
<p>Jinzhou Correspondence: After our exposure of the Japanese devil's conspiracy to incite the independence of Liaoning and Jilin provinces, they have recently intensified their efforts, using the same despicable methods, to actively proceed in various counties. The Liaoning Provincial Government recently reported based on reports from counties such as Tieling that the Japanese are even using false pretenses to draft so-called People's Autonomy Association regulations, forcibly requiring counties occupied by the Japanese devils to organize accordingly. The regulations consist of nine articles. Judging from the wording and content, they are clearly fabricated by the Japanese. The greatest objective within is to make each county independent, dividing the integrity of our sovereignty, and to exploit the weakness of our people's clan concepts, in order to achieve their conspiracy of manipulation and direction. They even recklessly use terms such as "revolution" and "warlords" to confuse our people's consciousness and falsely claim to abolish taxes, in order to ease our people's hostility towards them. Although their methods are extremely despicable, their intentions are indeed extremely sinister. Here are the so-called People's Autonomy Association regulations, copied verbatim, to see a glimpse of the Japanese conspiracy:</p>
<p>Pseudo-People's Autonomy Association Regulations (1) Spirit: Supreme and boundless. (2) Purpose: To create a rational organization and seek a fair and stable life for humanity. (3) Policy: To organize people's autonomy associations in various places, based on the people's perspective and regional units, and to exercise the people's right to survival. (4) Principles: 1. The people each retain the right to survival and the recognition of the right to mutual survival. 2. To retain freedom of religion and speech and to be responsible to all of humanity. 3. To retain the people's equal autonomy and all political powers. 4. The people must immediately sever relations with the evil government and evil forces. 5.

<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Requests Identification of Foreign Yarn. Since the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this county, investigators have been checking enemy goods at various ferry terminals. If suspected items are found, they are brought back to the Anti-Japanese Association for disposal. Yesterday (21st) afternoon, the Shanghai express train carried four large pieces of yarn, packed by the Shanghai Wansheng Mercerizing Factory, to the Yihe Socks Factory in Songjiang. The investigators noticed that the brand of the yarn was indeed produced by a Chinese factory, but the brand was pasted on separately, and there were traces of it being used before. The quality of the yarn was excellent, unlike domestic products, which was quite suspicious, so it was hired a cart to carry it back to the Anti-Japanese Association for disposal. Samples of the yarn were taken to various local sock factories, and everyone said that this kind of good goods did not seem to be domestic products, but it could not be definitively determined as enemy goods. Xu Xinmin was sent to Shanghai with the yarn samples to inquire at various factories and to ask the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to send personnel for precise identification. The yarn consisted of four large pieces, totaling one hundred and sixty packages. It is heard that another ten small packages of yarn belonging to the Zhenhe Factory, similar in quality to the Yihe Factory yarn, were seized in front of the court today.</p>

<p>The Min Surname Robbery Case Solved. Min Caichen, a trauma doctor in Sucheng Cang Street, also has a clinic outside the South Gate of Kunshan. On the afternoon of the previous day (21st), a bandit ship suddenly arrived, and six bandits entered and robbed the place. After seizing the loot, they took the ship and fled towards Suzhou. The 13th Kunshan Water Police team sent personnel to track and pursue them to Suzhou. The bandits in this case stayed at Room 26 of the Sanxin Inn on Liumen Road that night. Yesterday (22nd) morning, four bandits went to the station to take a train to Shanghai, when water police detectives Zhou Hongqing, together with the station military police, stepped forward and arrested them. According to their confessions, their names were Chen Wenhua, Lu Longxing, Ye Delu, and Jiang A'jin. They, along with the stolen goods, were taken back to Kunshan by the military police for interrogation.</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire, Rescuing a Large Number of Hostages. After the kidnapping case in Mochen Town, Changshu, Shen, the district chief of the 3rd Water Public Security District here, immediately ordered each team to step up arrests. The 14th team stationed in Wujiang and the 15th team stationed in Pingwang met more than one hundred bandits who looted Mochen, driving more than ten boats, at the junction of Tongli and Bei㘮 at about 7 pm on the 21st. The water police immediately opened fire, and the bandits also returned fire. The two sides held each other for three hours. The bandits retreated due to insufficient ammunition. At that time, three bandit ships were intercepted, and twelve male and female hostages were rescued. After receiving reports from each team yesterday (22nd), District Chief Shen personally took the Pei Rong battleship, leading a ship of teachers, and rushed to Zhouzhuang at 4 pm. At the same time, he ordered the 12th and 13th teams to set off immediately to encircle and suppress.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Nearly 300 Pieces of Enemy Goods Seized from Three Silk Shops. Yesterday (20th) afternoon at 3 pm, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county, led by Anti-Japanese Association Chairman Shen Zuguang and Investigation Directors Li Junyuan and Yang Yongzhi, went to various silk bureaus to search. They first went to the Tongfuchang Silk Bureau on County South Street, where they seized 158 pieces of unregistered foreign goods. Then they went to Gantaiheng on County West Street and seized 52 pieces, and Yongfeng 80 pieces, totaling 289 pieces. Three yellow rickshaws were used to transport them to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Center of the County Party Headquarters for sealing. The Silk Fabric Industry Association specially convened an emergency meeting overnight. As a result, Miao Chongjie, Wu Hongfan, Ren Qingyuan, and Feng Yiwen were selected to go to the Anti-Japanese Association, meet with Committee Member Shen, and request the return of these unregistered enemy goods for registration, because the procedure had not been clearly understood beforehand, and even zero pieces were included in the registration example. Moreover, after discussing with Anti-Japanese Association Committee Member Lu Gongquan, he had agreed not to register anymore. Shen replied that the goods that had been investigated must be approved by a meeting before there would be a solution, and that the contact with Lu Gongquan was a private matter, and Lu could not control the power of the entire association. Later, the four representatives also asked whether they could stop the search starting from tomorrow (21st) and let each store take out Japanese goods themselves, listing them alongside domestic goods so that customers could pay attention. The four representatives then left.</p>

<p>A Large Batch of Japanese Goods Seized from Xiechengyong. The Inspection Department of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association received a tip that the residence at No. 20 Donghetou Lane in the city contained Japanese cloth goods from Xiechengyong, guarded by two apprentices from the store. The department immediately sent investigators to verify that it was true. Minister Wang Ciqing led inspectors to the scene and notified Xiechengyong and the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to send police to assist in opening the lock. More than one hundred and several items of flower velvet, white velvet, flannel, and printed silk were found in the attic, waiting to be transported to the Anti-Japanese Association. Soon, many silk and cloth shop staff arrived, demanding that the goods be sealed up by the Chamber of Commerce. After a long argument, the party, government, and business sides agreed to temporarily seal the area by the Anti-Japanese Association. Unexpectedly, many workers suddenly demanded in the afternoon that the Anti-Japanese Association deposit the goods in the Anti-Japanese Association and strictly dispose of them. Li Tiping, Hu Nianqian, and Li Pu of the Anti-Japanese Association went to the Chamber of Commerce to discuss a solution. At that time, the masses had automatically rushed to Donghetou Lane to retrieve the goods, and the situation was extremely tense. In the evening, representatives from various related industries were elected to petition the county party headquarters and put forward three points: (1) All industries have already stopped buying and selling Japanese goods. The goods seized now were all purchased before the incident and have already been sealed. They should be re-registered. (2) Improve inspection methods. Before the deadline for re-registration, request a temporary suspension of inspections of residences and warehouses to maintain tranquility. (3) After the goods are sealed, they must be guaranteed, and the goods are all purchased by deposit or bank loans. It is winter and affects local finances. Request relief measures to maintain the commercial market. The county party committee members have agreed to consider and decide on a solution.</p>

The association telegraphed and invited 400 armed volunteers from the Institute of Technology to surround the shop. More than ten thousand pieces of Japanese goods labels were found in the warehouse. After checking the cloth in the main store one by one, more than one thousand bolts of Japanese cloth were found.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Wangdian Gentry Fu Xu Jinlan is Kidnapped. After the routine temple fair in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, a class was opened to perform operas to repay the gods. The town's public security bureau did not stop them. At about 8 pm on the 20th, while the performance was in full swing, six or seven bandits armed with pistols went to the Xishi Zushengchang Hotel and forcibly kidnapped the wealthy gentry Xu Jinlan, who was drinking in the shop. They got on a small boat that had been parked there in advance and sailed south. The 6th Water Police Team stationed in the town immediately gathered police officers and pursued them in different directions. At the same time, the land police and anti-smuggling battalion set out to encircle them. They encountered the bandit ship in Kaijing Port. The two sides opened fire. The bandits knew they were no match and abandoned the ship and hostages to escape ashore. Therefore, Xu Jinlan was taken back to the team headquarters by the water police and escorted home. The police are also following up on the case to strictly investigate the bandits.</p>

After the ceremony, (A) on reporting matters, the chairman reported that the emergency meeting was convened to discuss three important matters: (1) aiding students forced to leave the Sino-French School, (2) stopping illegal gatherings at Jinnan Affiliated Middle School, and (3) preserving the fundraising departure issue. Next, Sino-French School representative Ye Shuliang reported on the circumstances of being forced to leave the school, stating that the school had over 1,000 students and that its administration was purely based on religion, and that all academic subjects extremely emphasized French, akin to colonial education. This time, students were prohibited from holding patriotic movements and organizing anti-Japanese associations, and it was declared, "If you want to study at this school, you cannot be patriotic; if you want to be patriotic, you are not allowed to study at this school." Such absurd remarks were openly uttered by a French person. What is there to tolerate if this is tolerable? The students, with their ardent patriotism, intended to ignore it, but unexpectedly on the morning of the 20th, they were ordered to have all members of the over-grade and head-grade groups A and B leave the school, announced their expulsion, and were forced to leave the school. However, on one hand, they continued their efforts with a spirit of never giving up, and on the other hand, they hoped that the association would do its best to provide assistance so that the students would not have no place to study. (B) On discussion matters, (1) Regarding the case of students at the Sino-French School being expelled by the school authorities for organizing anti-Japanese associations, how should the association provide assistance? It was resolved (1) that the association should immediately request the City Education Bureau to negotiate with the French Consul in Shanghai; (2) that the association would recommend one standing member, plus three representatives from Fuzhong, Shizhong, and Wuben, to go to the Sino-French National Institute of Technology to request Principal Chu Minyi to allow them to transfer to that school; (3) that a declaration would be issued announcing the corrupt content of the school and advising future youths not to enter the school again. (2) Regarding the report from Datong Affiliated Middle School and other schools about Jinnan Affiliated Middle School and other schools holding illegal gatherings and scheduling representative congresses, how should the association stop them? It was resolved (1) to notify all schools not to participate; (2) to send letters to the four schools that had joined the association, namely, Shanghai North Middle School, Zhengfeng Middle School, Anhui Middle School, and Guohua Middle School, to question them; (3) to report to the City Party Headquarters to request a halt. (3) The association had previously scheduled to depart for fundraising on the 26th, but according to the report of the representative from the City Party Headquarters, the City Anti-Japanese Association already had concrete measures. Should the association still proceed as scheduled? It was resolved to preserve the issue and temporarily postpone it. (4) Regarding scheduling a citywide secondary school expanded propaganda campaign, it was resolved to set the date for Wednesday to Friday afternoon, with the address being one day in Shanghai and two days outside Shanghai, held simultaneously, with all expenses paid by the schools themselves. (5) Regarding the case of the association recommending representatives to pay respects to Mr. Wang Jingwei, it was resolved to recommend representatives from Minli Middle School for Girls, Wuben Girls' Middle School, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Datong Affiliated Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, and Jingye Middle School to go on the morning of the 23rd (today). (6) Regarding the case of regulating each school's duty to serve as a standing member of the association, it was resolved to stipulate that each school should pay five silver dollars per month, pending recognition and collection by the representative congress.

They were received by representatives Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke. The record of their conversation is as follows: (1) Asked about the student associations' advocacy of declaring war on Japan, what were the gentlemen's opinions? Wang replied that it had been discussed in Guangdong, and there was not only the final determination but also the necessary final preparations. (2) Asked about the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with Russia, what was the Guangdong side's position? Wang replied that it had not been discussed in Guangdong. (3) Asked about what the gentleman's personal attitude on the issue was. Wang replied that the Communist Party should be excluded, but diplomatic relations with Russia could be restored. However, in the past, the Russian consulate functioned as a communist organ, so it was necessary to search it. (4) Asked about the gentlemen's opinions on the issue of restoring civil rights. Sun replied that in principle, he absolutely agreed that revolution required the masses. Past failures were due to the lack of organization among the masses, which led to military command and politics resulting in a military dictatorship. The methods should be improved now. (5) Asked about the gentlemen's opinions on withdrawing from the League of Nations. Wang replied that he had said in a speech to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in Guangdong on October 19 that he had no hope for the League of Nations.

This was a diplomatic issue that should be discussed before a decision was made. (6) Asked about the gentleman's opinions on party affairs. Wang replied that the party should restore democratic centralism, and then politics could be democratically centralized. (7) Asked when he would have time to allow him to give a public speech. He replied that he was very busy now. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek would arrive today, and the date of the speech would be determined later. (8) Asked about the gentleman's opinions on the student movement. He replied that this was a long question to discuss. The most important thing was to build up strength. In the past, during the May Thirtieth and May Third incidents, it was not sustainable. Now, the focus should be on sustainability. After the major issues are resolved, it is hoped that the government can help the students. (9) Asked about the gentleman's opinions on the peace and unification conference. He replied that he had great hope for this conference. We came with great sincerity. There was no use. We hoped that the people would understand and that the comrades in Nanjing would understand, so that greater consultation could be successful, and so on.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Middle School's Fourth Anniversary Yesterday</h3>
<p>Provincial Shanghai Middle School in Nanshi, this city, held its fourth anniversary celebration yesterday. The commemorative meeting was held at 9 AM in the gymnasium of the junior high school department. Over 1,800 people attended, including teachers and staff of the school, students from the senior high school, junior high school, and experimental elementary school departments, as well as guests Hu Shuhua, President of Tongji University, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, and Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. All students wore uniform uniforms. The meeting opened with music. After the ceremony, Principal Zheng Xige gave a speech, generally reporting on the past four years and stating that he would make special efforts in the future to consolidate the foundation of the school, research work, and youth training. Next, guests Hu Shuhua, Xu Peihuang, and Li Zhaohuan gave speeches in succession, mostly encouraging young people to study hard and save the country. Then, Wang Yungong, the school's music education teacher, performed a violin solo, and Tian Ding'an, a representative of the faculty and staff, and Chen Zhengzhang, a student representative, gave speeches in succession. Finally, there was photography, music, and the anti-Japanese association. At 2 PM, a review of the student army and boy scouts was held in the high school department's playground. The senior high school and junior high school students were in full military attire, full of energy. In addition to the school's faculty and staff, there were also many guests serving as reviewing officers. After the review, the boy scouts and students successively performed drills with lively movements and skillful execution, which was greatly praised by the guests. It was also heard that the school originally planned to hold an achievement exhibition and a carnival, but due to the sudden dispatch of troops by the brutal Japanese to invade and occupy our country's Northeast, all the teachers and students of the school are dedicated to anti-Japanese national salvation affairs, so they have temporarily postponed it.</p>

<h3>The Tianma vs. Zejia Xiangbin Cup Final Tonight</h3>
<p>Location: The Racing Club Tongren Clubhouse</p>
<p>The Xiangbin Cup competition, which stands out and is famous throughout the country, has a long history that has long been known in the sports world. The Tianma team has won the most championships in the past, dominating the scene for a time, having won three times in succession. The Jiande team, which is well-known in Shanghai, has only won the championship once in the second edition. Although the team had joined this year, it suddenly withdrew; otherwise, it would not have been difficult to compete with Tianma and Zejia for the Xiangbin Cup. According to the cup competition's regulations, whoever wins the championship four times in succession can permanently keep the cup. Therefore, the Tianma team will definitely show their skills this time to fight for honor and fulfill their long-cherished wish. However, the Zejia team has talented generals like clouds, which can be called a strong enemy. It is entirely possible to defeat Tianma. Therefore, the final between the two teams tonight will definitely be a fierce battle. Unfortunately, due to the brutal Japanese invasion and the country being in danger, the cup competition's organizing committee decided to adopt a tight policy, holding it at the clubhouse and not inviting any guests due to venue constraints, preventing those interested in this sport from watching. It is said that the cup competition's staff expressed their deep apologies for this. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianma Team: Lu Hanjun (captain), Ma Tingliang, Weng Zhixiang, Ye Quangen, Zhu Jianzhang, Shen Zhuxi, Qian Xilin, Lu Changhui, Lu Dingchang, Hu Yongan,</p>
<p>Zejia Team: Luo Hongsheng (captain), Huang Xiangfa, Huang Anbang, Deng Guofu, Yang Guanci, Zhou Runshang, Zhang Decai, Liang Dahui, Liu Yingchi, Fang Keping,</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Liu Haisu's Report to the Ministry of Education After Returning to China (5)</h3>
<p>(1) The Organization and Establishment of Museums</p>
<p>Every major city and remote town in Europe has established museums to collect ancient and modern art relics and reproductions of masterpieces. This not only improves the aesthetic sense of the general public, but also provides resources for scholars and antiquarians to study. The collection and management have become specialized sciences. Therefore, all displays, cataloging, patching, and storage are carried out according to precise methods. As a result, they are well-ordered and magnificent. Ancient relic preservation sites exist in various parts of our country, but they are all perfunctory, with no reports or statistics, which clearly shows that they do not follow scientific methods. Moreover, there have been rumors from time to time that antiques have been stolen from various ancient relic exhibition sites, which is especially ridiculed by both Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, reorganizing existing museums and ancient relic preservation sites using scientific methods is a current urgent task. Furthermore, choose large cities with convenient transportation and high population density, such as Nanjing and Shanghai, to build large-scale museums, or expand existing preservation sites, or start and operate them in order to suit modern scales. All storage should prioritize treasures and genuine works. However, for famous works that cannot be moved but can be reproduced, such as statues from past dynasties and tomb gate reliefs related to art history, experts should be hired to reproduce them and distribute them to museums across the country, so that scholars everywhere can have convenient access to research and will not have to travel north and south to seek one object.</p>
<p>(2) The Establishment of the Republic of China Academy of Fine Arts</p>
<p>All European countries have established national academies of fine arts. In addition to France, the German state of Prussia is named the Akademie der Künste. The United Kingdom has the Royal Academy of Arts, and Belgium has the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Japan also has the Imperial Academy of Art. Well-known scholars and famous artists are selected as members to plan the direction of art education and art social facilities, provide the state with advice on art, study proposals for art schools, music schools, and museums, and preside over national periodic art exhibitions to attract art awards and promote the rise and fall of art matters. Although the systems vary from country to country, the intention is the same. Given the profound historical foundation of our country and the large number of undertakings to be carried out, the establishment of a national academy of fine arts should not be allowed to be lacking. In today's era, all artistic undertakings cannot be transferred according to the trends of one person or one family, but must seek to align with the intentions of the entire society. All innovations must have a comprehensive plan in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. People today often say that the economy is insufficient, but in fact, if there is a central organization to gather talent and plan and preside over it, being pragmatic and starting from the near and extending to the far, even a small amount of economy can become a large amount of undertaking. If one chokes and refuses to eat, then the backwardness of Chinese culture will never be able to revitalize itself. In Haisu's foolish opinion, the national academy of fine arts, the main focus of art facilities, is also a major institution that our country urgently wants to organize.</p>
<p>(3) The Improvement of the Art School System</p>
<p>Our country's art schools have recently set a three-year study period, which is comparable to the vocational schools of industry and commerce. However, a review of art schools in Europe shows that their goal is to cultivate advanced art experts, with no fixed time limit. Their research process is similar to that of universities. From Haisu's experience, it is felt that art schools are fundamentally different in nature from other vocational schools. Therefore, the three-year time limit is actually too short. Is it not ridiculous to apply the time limit for learning ordinary arithmetic, bookkeeping, and bookkeeping to those who study literature and philosophy? Although our country is currently in a transitional era, there is no need to seek perfection in everything. However, the distinction between high-level academic art and ordinary technology must be clarified. In the field of art schools, whether cultivating teachers or cultivating experts, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath as ordinary vocational technology. Even for the sake of meeting the urgent needs of society, for example, regarding teachers of music, painting, and handicrafts, who are expected to be quickly trained, they may be regarded as being the same as vocational technology. However, high-level academic art must be treated as a separate matter and cannot be mixed up. In Haisu's foolish opinion, the study period for art schools should be at least five years. The departments and systems for cultivating teachers may be slightly shortened. This is already a compromise compared to European countries. If you think that high-level academic art cannot be borrowed and that scholars should be spared from superficiality, then the improvement of the school system is a matter that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>(4) The Necessity of Articulating Material Construction</p>
<p>In recent years, construction projects have been changing with each passing day in various parts of our country, and the increasing modernization of cities is a particularly prominent fact. During Haisu's travels in Europe, visiting cities of all sizes, I could not help but think about how each place has its own strengths. The display of these strengths to the people's eyes depends on the articulation of art in construction. The articulation of art in construction is not a difficult task. The key is for the designers to pay attention to the trends of the times and the circumstances of the location, arrange public and private buildings, and make organic coordination, avoiding all unreasonable and irregular forms, and everywhere taking being pleasing to the eye as the criterion, not seeking beauty but being beautiful. In the past, urban construction in our country was either presided over by foreigners or copied old chapters, so there was a strange hybrid style. Now, at a time when construction is progressing, we should pay attention to the principles of articulation of art, so that residents feel happy and views are appropriate, creating a model district in the East, which is what the authorities engaged in construction would be happy to hear.</p>
<p>Haisu's luggage has been unloaded in the south, and the first thoughts are varied. The above is a general outline, a preliminary presentation of what I can remember at the moment, to serve as a starting point. As for detailed reports and research insights, please allow me some time to continue organizing them so that the government and the people can take note of them together.</p>

<h3>Key Party and Government Figures Gather Together</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results from Consultations at Sun's Residence</p>
<p>Sincere Unity to Face External Enemies</p>
<p>Chiang Returns to Nanjing by Plane in the Evening</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei and others arrived in Shanghai and met with various committees in Nanjing, the methods for peaceful unification have been of general concern. It is learned that Chairman Chiang also arrived in Shanghai by plane yesterday morning and gathered at Sun Ke's residence at 2 PM in the afternoon for consultations. After the meeting, Chiang returned to Nanjing by plane. The results of the consultations and various circumstances are compiled and recorded separately as follows.</p>
<h3>Consultations at Sun's Residence</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 10 AM yesterday morning and held the first meeting at Sun's residence at 10 Moliere Road at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. Key party and government figures such as Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Sun Ke gathered together to discuss matters harmoniously for about two hours. This meeting was of great importance to the safety and security of the party and the country. The initial results yesterday were satisfactory, and the future looked optimistic.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>From Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and Shao Yuanchong. From Guangdong, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Zou Lu, and Hu Hanmin, totaling fifteen people.</p>
<h3>Gathering at Song's Residence</h3>
<p>Before the Nanjing and Guangdong representatives met yesterday, the Nanjing representatives first convened a talk at Song's residence on Seymour Road at around 12 PM. The attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Zhang Jingjiang, and Zhu Peide, totaling more than ten people. Zhang Ji and Cai Yuanpei Chen Mingshu served as intermediaries, traveling between Sun's residence on Moliere Road and Song's residence on Seymour Road to convey the necessary contacts between the two sides before they met. Zhang and Cai went to Sun's residence once at 12:30 PM for contact, and Chen Mingshu went to Sun's residence twice at 1:10 PM and 1:45 PM before deciding to officially meet at Sun's residence at 10 Moliere Road at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Meeting Scheduled</h3>
<p>The six Guangdong representatives had lunch at Sun's residence yesterday afternoon. Upon learning that Chiang had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, Chiang sent someone to Sun's residence to notify them, and they agreed to meet at Sun's residence at 2 PM in the afternoon. At exactly 2 PM, Hu Hanmin arrived at Sun's residence first, and Chiang arrived at 2:15 PM. As for Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and Shao Yuanchong, they were already seated. After meeting and exchanging greetings, they discussed peaceful unification and sincere unity, and other methods. At 4:30 PM, Chiang left first, and Zhang Jingjiang also left ten minutes later. Before long, Zhang Ji left with Yu Youren. Finally, Cai Yuanpei and Chen Mingshu also left Sun's residence one after another, while the six Guangdong representatives remained resting at Sun's residence.</p>
<h3>Shaking Hands and Making Peace</h3>
<p>After arriving at Sun's residence, Chiang first expressed his longing for the people who had come to Shanghai from Guangdong. Wang and others also exchanged pleasantries, shaking hands, and laughing, and they were very happy. Then, they discussed the importance of diplomatic issues and unity to jointly face the national crisis. Chiang earnestly expressed during the meeting that he hoped that his comrades would immediately go to Nanjing to jointly assume the important task of saving the country. All matters could be discussed in detail, and he would be happy to comply with anything that benefited the party and the country. Hu, Wang, Sun, Wu, and others spoke one after another, all believing that the realization of unity was extremely urgent. After chatting for one hour and twenty-five minutes, Chiang took his leave. According to a certain central committee member who participated in the talks, the impression of all parties at yesterday's talks was excellent. Sincere unity would definitely be achieved, but before entering Nanjing, there would be several more talks in Shanghai. It is heard that Zhang Jingjiang and Li Shizeng will participate.</p>
<h3>Consultation Results</h3>
<p>The consultation process was very good. After the consultation, the Guangdong side issued the following statement: The six Guangdong representatives still spoke based on their previous demands and explained that the purpose of their visit to Shanghai for consultations on peaceful unification was that the party, government, and military must undergo fundamental improvements and reforms. In other words, democratic politics must be established. Chiang expressed acceptance. After this sincere meeting between the two sides, two methods were decided: (1) In terms of diplomacy, a consensus must first be reached in order to jointly face the national crisis. (2) For issues such as party affairs, politics, and military affairs, Nanjing will appoint representatives to come to Shanghai to hold a preparatory meeting with the Guangdong representatives, jointly discuss detailed methods, and formulate a detailed draft. The draft will then be taken to Nanjing by the representatives of both sides to hold a formal meeting and make a final decision. The two sides, in view of previous mistakes, are determined to be especially cautious in future discussions.</p>
<h3>Recommending Representatives</h3>
<p>The representatives from Nanjing were originally Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, and Chen Mingshu. Yesterday, after unanimous additions by the central committee members, Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang were added to consult with the Guangdong representatives on everything. However, the formal appointment must await approval by the Central Standing Committee.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, accompanied by Central Committee member Chen Bu-lei, arrived in Shanghai at 10:20 AM yesterday, aboard a newly purchased American aircraft from Nanjing. Those accompanying him were only Chief of the Guard Wang Shi-he, Special Affairs Chief Zhang Menghao, and two guards. The plane landed at Hongqiao Airport. Wu Tie-cheng, Chen Mingshu, Deputy Director of the Garrison Headquarters Jiang Yi, Mayor Zhang Qun, Police Chief Chen Xi-zeng, and others personally went to the airport to greet him. After disembarking, Chiang went directly to his private residence on Avenue Joffre to rest.</p>
<h3>Various Committee Members Pay Visits</h3>
<p>Chiang then went to the Song residence on Seymour Road. Those who visited him successively included Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, Zhu Peide, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Chen Bu-lei. Each committee member gave a detailed report on the progress of the negotiations with the Guangdong representatives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Appointment Time</h3>
<p>Around 12:00 PM, Chiang telegraphed Yang Hu to meet for talks. Yang sent a representative to the Sun residence on Route Moliere to arrange the time and location for Chiang, Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Sun Ke to meet. At the time, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Lu, and others were present. It was decided that the meeting would be held at the Sun residence at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Consultation at Private Residence</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang arrived at the Sun residence at 2:15 PM and departed at 3:40 PM, returning to his residence on Avenue Joffre. The meeting lasted for one hour and twenty-five minutes. Central Committee members Shao Lizi, Zhu Peide, and Wu Tiecheng had already arrived at Chiang's residence. After Chiang arrived, he reported the results of the meeting and discussed the next steps. Shortly after, Mayor Zhang Qun and Central Committee member Chen Bu-lei also arrived to attend the meeting, which lasted for twenty minutes.</p>
<h3>Return to Nanjing by Original Plane</h3>
<p>Around 4:00 PM, Song Zi-liang, Zi-an, and their brothers paid a visit. At 4:05 PM, Chairman Chiang, along with Special Affairs Chief Zhang Menghao and the guards, went directly to Hongqiao Airport and returned to Nanjing on the original plane at 4:35 PM. Police Chief Chen Xi-zeng personally went to the airport to take care of everything. Furthermore, Central Committee members Shao Lizi and Chen Bu-lei returned to Nanjing on the 11:45 PM night train last night. Chief of the Guard Wang Shi-he, due to some matters, did not travel with Chairman Chiang and also rushed to Nanjing on the night train last night.</p>
<h3>Chiang's Telegraph for Resignation Postponed</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang's telegraph announcing his resignation had already been drafted. It contained words such as "peaceful unification, sincere unity, and resignation from the Central Government to relinquish responsibilities once a concrete plan has been agreed upon." This telegraph was originally scheduled to be published after the Guangdong representatives arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, after the Guangdong representatives arrived in Shanghai the day before, Wu Tiecheng handed the telegraph to Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji to be forwarded to Wang Jingwei. After discussions among various parties, it was generally agreed that issuing Chiang's telegram during this time of urgent diplomacy would have an impact on international public opinion. Now that the spirit of comrades in Nanjing and Guangdong has become consistent, this formality could be omitted. It was therefore decided to temporarily postpone the release of this telegram.</p>
<h3>Zhang, Wang, and Lin's Talks</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Puquan: Yesterday, after the talks at the Sun residence on Route Moliere concluded, a reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Puquan about the details of the meeting. Mr. Zhang replied that the talks this afternoon had made a very good impression. After the comrades exchanged greetings, Mr. Chiang spoke first, stating that in the face of national crisis, diplomatic response was of the utmost importance. If there was a unified approach to foreign affairs, other issues concerning the Party and the country could be addressed. He personally would be happy to comply with whatever was decided, hoping that they would unite sincerely from now on, consider things carefully, take the overall situation into account, and establish a good foundation for the country. Wang Jingwei spoke the most on behalf of Guangdong, expressing strong agreement with Mr. Chiang's proposal for a unified front against foreign aggression. He also strongly advocated avoiding the term "equal meeting," stating that it was entirely a consultation among comrades. As for the location of the meeting, it was best to hold it in Nanjing, which everyone agreed with. Mr. Chiang said that the Foreign Affairs Committee was originally scheduled to meet in Nanjing at 7:00 PM tonight (the 22nd) and that he had to attend in person. Therefore, after the meeting, he took the same plane back to Nanjing and would consult with the Central Committee members in Nanjing again. He and Mr. Cai Jiemin were also scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight to report to the Central Government on the trip to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei met with representatives of various university anti-Japanese associations at Mr. Hu Zhantang's residence yesterday. The details of the discussion at the time were as follows: (Representative asked,) What are your views on the issue of declaring war on Japan? (Wang replied,) The issue of declaring war on Japan requires not only a final determination but also final preparations. (Asked,) What about the issue of restoring relations with Russia? (Answered,) It is not impossible to restore diplomatic relations with Russia, as long as Soviet Russia does not harm us, then relations can be restored. As for the communists, they must still be excluded. (Asked,) Is it feasible to withdraw from the League of Nations? (Answered,) On September 19th, I gave a speech in Guangdong, expressing my disappointment with the League of Nations. However, if we talk about withdrawing from the League of Nations, it seems that there is a need for discussion, because we cannot allow China's international status to be further isolated. (Asked,) How can party affairs be perfected? (Answered,) We should first restore the spirit of democracy. With the spirit of democracy, there can be a way to improve the Party. Finally, the representatives asked Sun Ke about the issue of mass movements. (Sun replied,) Mass movements are absolutely supported in principle because revolution must have the support of the masses, but in the past, they have all failed. The reason for this is that the masses are not organized. What we are currently studying is the method, so in the future, mass movements should improve their methods. At this point, Wang and Sun also said that peaceful unification is very hopeful. We have come here with sincerity and no ulterior motives, hoping for public understanding, and also hoping that our comrades in Nanjing can also understand, so that we can succeed without much negotiation.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lin Sen</h3>
<p>Lin Sen, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 18th of this month with the Guangdong peace representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, and others by ship. However, because the President Madison was fully booked in Hong Kong, he waited until the next day (19th) and changed to the German mail ship Haifuran to come to Shanghai. The ship entered the Wusongkou port at 11:30 AM yesterday and docked at the Wayside Wharf. Chen Mingshu, Chairman Chiang's representative, received a report from the customs and was preparing to go to the wharf to greet him. However, due to urgent official business, his wife, Ms. Zhu Guangzhen, and his confidant Deng Ruiren, went to greet him instead. Central Committee members Wu Tiecheng, Shao Yuanchong, Zhou Qigang, and others also went to welcome him. After landing, Lin took the car prepared by Chen Mingshu's wife and went to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest. In the afternoon, he met with Wang, Hu, and others at the Sun residence on Route Moliere, and the meeting was very pleasant. Lin told the reporter from Huadong News Agency, "I just arrived and heard that Mr. Chiang is already in Shanghai, but I haven't met him yet. I came here to visit Mr. Hu Zhantang, and I am very optimistic about the future of peace. Both sides have been met." As for whether he would accept the position of President of the Legislative Yuan, he said that it was not the time to talk about it yet. Mr. Chen Yaoyuan, a member of the Central Committee who accompanied me back home, was the one who went with me to visit and comfort the overseas Chinese in Nanyang. However, Mr. Chen was kept by his family because he had been away from his hometown in Guangdong for eight or nine years, so he could not come to Shanghai with me. In addition, Mr. Gui Chongji also came with me. As for whether my name was listed in the previous telegram sent from Guangdong, this is not a problem either."</p>
<h3>Gathering at the Hu Residence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and others met at Hu Gongguan on Mersi Avenue around 8:00 AM and held a discussion meeting, which lasted until 10:30 AM. After the representatives left, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Guangdong representative Zou Lu, who said that this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) they met with Mr. Hu, but there was no specific discussion. However, because after each representative arrived in Shanghai, they had to meet every day in the morning and afternoon to discuss everything at any time.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Request for Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to meeting with the peace representatives at the Sun residence, other groups from all walks of life, upon hearing that Wang and Hu had arrived, successively requested meetings. These included representatives from the Kuomintang Party Protection and National Salvation Comrades Association and more than ten people including the secretary of the Indian League, Tarashan (an Indian). Central Committee member Lin Sen, National Government Military Counselor Yang Hu, and Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan also visited Wang and Hu and met at the Sun residence.</p>
<h3>Condolences to Hu Hanmin</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Hu moved to his new residence, condolences from various parties have continued to pour in. In the past two days, he has received more than 260 telegrams and more than 500 letters expressing joy at Mr. Hu's role in presiding over the peace talks, and especially showing their sympathy for Mr. Hu's deleted telegram. More than 20 people have also expressed concern for Mr. Hu's health and presented prescriptions for his use, which shows the depth of everyone's respect for Mr. Hu. The key points of the telegrams from various parties are recorded as follows: (1) Chen Ce telegraphed (excerpt above): I respectfully learned of the deleted telegram. Wenjiong safely arrived in Shanghai, which is very gratifying. I have sent Liu Jun Zhi Mian to represent me and respectfully wait on you. Chen Ce bows. (2) Zhang Shu and other comrades from Guangdong telegraphed: Sir, you have fought for the principle and have finally gained the sympathy of the national people. At this time of internal and external difficulties, I hope you will implement your original intention to save the Party and the country. (3) Zhong Ji Deng Qingyang telegraphed: Hearing that you have arrived in Shanghai, my long-standing worries have been relieved. Recalling the micro words in the talk, I am even more delighted. Reading the deleted telegram, I am very impressed. At this time of difficulty, I only rely on you to resolve the situation. (4) Huang Yougong telegraphed: Hearing that you have safely arrived in Shanghai, I am very pleased. The restoration of the Party and the country depends on your hard work. Also yesterday, the representatives from various parties who came to comfort Mr. Hu at his residence included Li Guocai representing Chen Jitang, Liu Zhimian representing Chen Ce, Zhang Zixuan representing Zhang Huichang, Lin Zhimian representing the Guangdong Provincial Party Department, Lu Yougang representing the Guangzhou Municipal Party Department, Chen Jianru representing Ma Chaojun, a member of the Guangdong National Government, and Mai Muyou representing Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, Shi Guangquan representing the Hunan Provincial Government, and more than 20 representatives including Yu Hanmou and Xiang Hanping. In addition, Zhou Bogan, commander of the newly compiled 32nd Division, Zhang Fang, commander-in-chief of the 20th Route Army, and a certain important person from the Northwest also sent representatives to pay their respects to Mr. Hu to discuss the overall situation in the future.</p>
<h3>Ju Zheng to Come to Shanghai Immediately</h3>
<p>Ju Zheng, a member of the First Central Committee, is recuperating in Nanjing. Now that the Peace and Unification Conference is about to be held, comrades from all parties hope that he will come to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss the major plans of the Party and the country. It is reported that Central Committee members Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and others have sent telegrams urging him to come, and Central Committee members Chen Guofu and others in Nanjing have also personally visited his residence to urge him to come quickly. Ju has decided to take the night train to Shanghai on the 23rd and is expected to arrive at the port at 7:00 AM on the 24th. Comrades at sea are now preparing to go to the station to welcome him at that time.</p>
<h3>Reception for the Press Today</h3>
<p>The Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and others have arrived in Shanghai. Due to the tight schedule, they have no time to meet with the press. It has been decided that they will host a reception for Shanghai reporters at Wu Chaoshu's residence at No. 29 Gordon Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Invitations have been sent out by the Guangdong representatives' office last night.</p>
<h3>Wang's Stay at the Liu Residence</h3>
<p>After Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai the day before, all his luggage and staff were at the Cangzhou Hotel. Wang himself and his wife, Chen Bijun, were staying at the new residence of Liu Weichi, the former director of the two railway bureaus, on Koenig Road, which is currently being renovated and decorated and will be completed in a few days.</p>
<h3>Ye Kaixin's Banquet</h3>
<p>Ye Kaixin hosted a banquet for Tang Shengzhi, Tang Shengming, Zhang Yipeng, and Huang Shaoxiong, members of the Guangdong Military Affairs Committee, as well as inviting He Yaozu and others to accompany them, at his private residence at No. 165 Seymour Road at 7:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Submits a Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Please Don't Let the Ambassador Yield in the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department telegraphed the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing yesterday: Since the violent Japanese destroyed international conventions, disregarded world peace, and sent troops to forcibly occupy the Eastern Provinces for a month, our people have been determined to save the country. In the midst of solemn endurance, they trust the government and wait quietly for the League of Nations to take concrete and effective measures in accordance with the conventions to uphold justice, stop violence, maintain its own life, and protect the peace of mankind. However, the League of Nations' hope that Japan will withdraw its troops has not been realized again and again, and Japan's fire in our territory is getting more and more fierce, and the destruction is getting worse. They have turned a blind eye to it. Recent news has come that Japan has proposed five principles for withdrawing troops, suggested it to Briand, and requested negotiations with our Ambassador Shi. At the same time, the League of Nations Council will postpone it for three weeks, authorizing Briand to mediate in order to complete the withdrawal of troops. The League of Nations is so protecting the powerful and deceiving and perfunctory, which is no less than yielding to Japan. The death penalty is self-announced. Our country should take self-defense actions and rise up to take responsibility for maintaining international conventions. Furthermore, the five principles for withdrawing troops proposed by Japan are extremely absurd. If this can be negotiated, it is tantamount to acknowledging the country-destroying treaty of 21 Articles. Our people are even more deeply angry. At this time of life and death, we must not be negligent and make mistakes. In the view of the Council, there are two points that must be insisted: (1) Japan's dispatch of troops to the Eastern Provinces is obviously an act of war. Unless Japan first withdraws troops unconditionally and acknowledges compensation for all damages, our country should never negotiate with it in any way, and it is not allowed to propose any counter-proposals for the so-called conditions for withdrawing troops. (2) If the League of Nations forces China to recognize any preconditions for Japan's withdrawal of troops, and any resolutions that violate the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or the Nine-Power Treaty, China should resolutely reject them, and please ask Ambassador Shi not to declare again, "China absolutely unconditionally obeys the League of Nations' decisions and actions," etc., so as not to put himself in a difficult situation. Time is urgent, so I especially telegraphed to you for verification and attention, and begged you to quickly give an order to Ambassador Shi to pay close attention to it in order to save the crisis. Otherwise, the diplomatic humiliation will ruin the country, and the sin will be traced to you. The Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, with the utmost urgency, bows.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yaozeng's Letter to the People of the Country</h3>
<p>In the cooperative efforts of all nations in the world to create peace and reduce armaments, under the faith guarantee of the International League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, Japan, which claims to be civilized, suddenly launched a large army, launched a surprise attack in the dark night, seized my famous cities, slaughtered my people, plundered my armaments, seized my political power, destroyed my transportation, and blockaded my finances. In two days, it plundered the capital and important places of my Chinese territory in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin for thousands of miles and placed them under artillery fire, letting them wreak havoc. This is truly unprecedented violence in history and a bomb to destroy human civilization. It is a fatal insult to my Chinese nation. My nation is in this tragic change, for the sake of its own survival, for the sake of human culture, rising up generously, exhausting all the spiritual power of my entire nation, rushing forward together, and doing everything possible to subdue the violent sun and support justice. This is not only the obligation of my nation to our ancestors, but also the inevitable mission to human culture. I believe that all my compatriots have deeply felt this obligation and this mission, and I also believe that all my compatriots will be able to sincerely practice it. However, Yaozeng is anxious and there is something I must respectfully tell all my compatriots: In the face of extraordinary changes, we must rely on extraordinary strength. Extraordinary strength cannot be produced without extraordinary unity. Extraordinary unity cannot be achieved without extraordinary awareness. My nation has been invaded by the violent sun for a long time, and the disasters have come one after another. It is not that we have not tried to resist it, but the resisters resist, and the invaders invade more and more. Now they are peeling off our skin and touching our bones, and in an instant, they reach our heart. This is because the resisters have no real strength, and the source of the chaos and weakness of my nation has not been eliminated. Please observe the Jiaoji Incident of the Japanese Kou in the 17th year of the Republic of China. It can be said to be a strange shame and humiliation. My people have sworn to resist it to the death, but what have we done in the past three or four years? Have we worked together to build a national defense against Japan? Have we cooperated sincerely to strengthen our domestic strength? No, we haven't. Because we have not, we have today's strange change. Today's crisis and danger are hundreds of times greater than before. The Chinese people's resistance and struggle are also hundreds of times greater than before. However, gnashing their teeth and roaring in anger, they cannot be said to have real strength. Real strength cannot be produced without consistent unity, vigorous progress, and unremitting efforts. We talk about unity, but everyone has their own biases and acts in their own self-interest. It cannot be said to be real unity. Real unity cannot be produced unless everyone is fully aware of their own mistakes in the past, deeply repents, and cherishes each other. Who is to blame for today's tragedy and humiliation of my nation? My nation is to blame. The celebrities of my nation have attacked, killed, and weakened the whole nation by their thoughts and actions, causing the whole nation to be chaotic and weak. Alas, even today, do we want to follow their thoughts and inherit their actions while talking about unity and saving the country in vain? I am afraid that my ancestor, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, will not forgive me. Now, please each of my compatriots respectfully stand and silently pray, think deeply, and reflect deeply: Where is the source of the chaos and weakness of my nation? The source of chaos and weakness is in me: daring to be self-confident and positioning myself high, thinking that no one is like me in loving the country and saving the nation, and everyone should be used by me and should not resist me. Those who obey me must be protected, and those who are different from me must be removed, regardless of good or evil, and by any means. This is the source of chaos and weakness. Do I have this? Regarding the local area as an area for support, and holding the troops as a means of self-defense, I focus on enriching my military strength every day and expanding my territory as my goal. When I have the opportunity, I merge and attack, and when I lose power, I divide and occupy. I specialize in using various beautiful names to indulge my great desires and vent my personal anger. I do not care about the lives and property of my compatriots. I do not ask about faith, justice, law, and discipline. This is the source of chaos and weakness. Do I have this? Relying on the power of the country to run my own livelihood, accepting bribes and selling officials, embezzling public funds, and my personal life is extravagant, and I have many ways to increase my wealth. This is the source of chaos and weakness. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Stamp Banknotes with Anti-Japanese Symbols</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the trade associations of various industries in this city, stating that there are many methods of economic severance with Japan. Adding a rubber stamp of "Do Not Buy Japanese Goods" to silver coins or paper money is even more striking. When using this silver coin or paper money, seeing the four characters "Do Not Buy Japanese Goods," the patriotic heart is bound to be aroused. This matter is small, but its impact is great. The amount of money collected and resolved by each store every day is not small, and the financial industry is the general exchange of currency. If the rubber stamp of "Do Not Buy Japanese Goods" is stamped on the banknotes and silver coins issued and received, it will be widely circulated and easily spread for the purpose of propaganda for economic severance with Japan. It is appropriate to send a letter to notify you and hope that your Association will forward it to your colleagues to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Stop Distributing Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Same Will Be Done in Seventeen Commercial Ports</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Anti-Japanese Relief Association of Overseas Chinese in Central Vietnam yesterday, stating that since the Japanese pirates invaded my Southern Manchuria, after the news spread, all overseas Chinese were filled with indignation at the destruction of Japan. Amidst this excitement, the Anti-Japanese Relief Association of Overseas Chinese in Central Vietnam was organized to act as a backing for the negotiations between the motherland and Japan. Since Japan has always invaded my country with economic policies, it is necessary to boycott Japanese goods in order to control the Japanese slaves and benefit the livelihood of my country. Therefore, the second meeting of this association resolved to send a letter to the chambers of commerce of major commercial ports at home and abroad, and to notify the trade associations under their jurisdiction to stop distributing goods to the seventeen commercial ports under this association, in order to prevent the source of inferior goods. A corresponding letter is sent, hoping that you will investigate and follow it. The names of the seventeen commercial ports are as follows: Yi'an, Heting, Guangping, Shunhua, Danang, Guangyi, Pingding, Fuan, Nha Trang, Fanlang, Qinghe, Fanli, Fanche, Guangzhi, Sanqi, and Hui'an.</p>

They also filled out voluntary declarations stating they would never buy or sell Japanese goods, expressing their determination to sever economic ties with Japan. The various shops welcomed the inspection committee members of the Municipal Federation and willingly cooperated with the confiscations. It is reported that major companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and The Sun Sun, which were sealed by the first district branch of the Municipal Federation, are also willing to request the Municipal Federation to expedite further sealing to verify the situation.</p>
<p>The 17th District Branch of the Municipal Federation Began Inspections Yesterday: The 17th District Branch of the Citizens' United Association appointed Chen Jiufeng, Chen Xisheng, Fang Huijian, and Jiang Xianhe as members of the Committee for Inspecting Japanese Goods, and also invited Tan Yuchang, a specialist in foreign goods, Liu Taoru, a cotton cloth merchant, Gao Jieyuan, a seafood dealer, Shu Wenyao, a wood merchant, and committee members from the electrical materials industry.

<p>Increased Coal Freight Rates on the Jiaoji Railway</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Requests Assistance</h3>
<p>The Japanese Director of the Railway Traffic Department</p>
<p>Takes the Opportunity to Periodically Increase Prices</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Central Government to Repeal the Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sent a telegram stating: To the Shanghai Special City Party Department, Shanghai Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and all industrial, commercial, agricultural, and academic groups in Shanghai: The invasion by the violent Japanese is causing indignation among people and gods. Severing economic ties with Japan is the duty of every citizen and a unanimous demand. Japanese coal, as a commodity, is naturally no exception. The southern provinces of China have historically consumed up to two-thirds of the total amount of Japanese coal. Now that it is being rejected, domestic coal should be urgently transported to replace it. If the transport of domestic coal is delayed, the southern provinces will immediately face a coal shortage. If coal runs out, the functions of warships, merchant ships, trains, and all factories, electric lights, and tap water will completely cease to operate. Such an environment is extremely dangerous. As of October 20, the total stock of coal in Shanghai is only 300,000 tons, which is only enough to supply for one month. Therefore, it is urgent to transport domestic coal to replenish the supply. However, the Japanese director of the Jiaoji Railway Traffic Department is taking this opportunity to periodically increase freight rates for domestic coal, effective November 1. The special export price has been increased from 2.52 yuan per ton to 2.80 yuan, leading to reports of Shandong mines suspending operations. Such actions are tantamount to harming our national lifeline. In addition to urgently telegraphing the central government to order the repeal, we hereby request assistance to cancel the increased freight rates for coal on the Jiaoji Railway to avoid a coal shortage. This matter concerns the national lifeline. We implore your approval and urgently submit this petition for your consideration. Shanghai Coal Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Korean Residents Host a Banquet for the Press</h3>
<p>Koreans and Chinese Should Sincerely Unite. Ahn Chang-ho, Chairman of the Korean Residents Association in Shanghai and Prime Minister of the Korean Provisional Government, hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the Jinling Restaurant at 7:00 PM last night, with more than 20 people attending. During the banquet, Mr. Ahn delivered a speech detailing the thorough union of the Korean and Chinese peoples to overthrow Japanese imperialism. He stated that the Japanese side has been making all kinds of provocations, trying to alienate the feelings of the people of the two countries. Fortunately, the people of your country should not be deceived by them. Premier Sun Yat-sen once said that Korean independence is to cut off the bridge for Japan to invade China, so it is the key to the survival of China. He hoped that everyone would deeply understand this statement. Then Zhao Su-ang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Korean Provisional Government, gave a speech detailing the situation of Japan's invasion of Northeast China. Finally, the press made a reply. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until after 9:00 PM, and the party broke up.</p>
<h3>Three American Ships Return to Fiji</h3>
<p>Fourteen American destroyers, ordered to Shanghai from Yantai, originally planned to stay in Shanghai for ten days and then return to Manila. Yesterday, the commander of the fleet ordered the USS Bellan (DD-226), USS Borie (DD-227), and USS Talbott (DD-229) to return to Manila first. The other ships will also leave Shanghai in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Rectifying Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes and Implementing Registration</h3>
<p>The National Government, in view of the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, plans to strictly prohibit them, but considering the difficulties of the industry, it will first register and rectify them to indicate that taxes are collected with tickets. The Ministry of Finance has now established the National Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants Registration Office next to the Popular Cinema on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen. In addition to appointing Director Yin and Director Shen, there are also various staff members such as registration investigators, as well as tea servants and messengers, totaling more than 30 people. It is reported that work will begin soon, starting with Shanghai within Jiangsu Province. The counties of Baoshan, Chuansha, Chongming, and Qidong will proceed in order. The entire Jiangsu Province is expected to be completed within six months.</p>
<h3>Quarantine Office Reports on Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>The National Seaport Quarantine Office issued the thirteenth report on cholera prevention: (1) According to last week's report, Yu Wu claimed to have predicted that cholera could be alleviated. However, in the most recent week (ending October 17), there were 30 patients and 5 deaths, which is now being verified. The breakdown by jurisdiction is as follows: Shanghai City had 12 patients and 3 deaths, the Public Concession had 15 patients and 1 death, and the French Concession had 3 patients and 1 death. In total, there were 30 patients and 5 deaths. (2) Because there are still a few cases of cholera in Shanghai, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road is still receiving patients as usual. The hospital focuses on practical work, as always. (3) According to reports from Hankou and various flood-stricken areas, cholera has also decreased sharply, and the total number of patients is less than 1,000. From this, it can be seen that the Water Disaster Relief Committee has paid close attention to epidemic prevention work. (4) Various agencies in Shanghai Seaport stopped cholera prevention injections on October 7. From May 1, a total of 522,466 people were vaccinated. The French Concession stopped on October 15. From April 1, 63,874 people were vaccinated. The number of the Public Concession will be finalized and published next week. (5) The report on the plague in Henan was untrue, as previously reported by newspapers. This office sent many technicians to investigate, and the patients suffered from severe tertian malaria, not plague. The number of deaths was no more than 100. From this, it can be seen the importance of establishing health agencies in various provinces, so that the health reports can be used as a reference for countries around the world, so as not to be misleading. (6) As for the plague discovered between Shaanxi and Shanxi, it is definitely correct, because that place was the center of a local epidemic of plague ten years ago. The National Government is very concerned about this disaster and hopes to eliminate the most harmful plague as soon as possible. It has ordered the concentration of medical and health personnel to go to rescue, and the personnel of the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office have also packed their bags and left Harbin to go to Taiyuan, and then to the disaster area to rescue.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the National Anti-Drug Conference</h3>
<p>Representatives are being recommended by overseas and domestic organizations</p>
<p>Concrete representations will be made to the government</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association originally scheduled to convene the National Anti-Drug Representatives Conference at the West Lake in Hangzhou on November 1. Subsequently, due to the invasion of the violent Japanese, the whole country unanimously confronted foreign countries, and the Conference decided to postpone the Conference to January 1 to 5 next year. Separate telegrams have been sent to anti-drug organizations in various places for reference. It is reported that remote associations such as the Singapore Anti-Drug Association have appointed the vice chairman of the association, Lin Jindian, to return to the country to attend. The Anti-Drug Association specifically telegraphed to invite him to postpone his visit to Hangzhou. In addition, Dr. Chen Jinhuang, a smoking cessation expert from the Batavia Anti-Drug Association, was also specially invited by the association to attend the meeting. Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and led several well-known overseas Chinese doctors to Han first to assist in epidemic prevention in the disaster area. He will come to Hangzhou to attend the meeting at that time. In addition, dozens of anti-drug associations in Chengdu, Tianjin, Andong, Liaoning, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Kaifeng, Taiwan, Yancheng, Rugao, Wujin, Pei County, Yangzhong, Dongtai, Yutai, Zhao County, etc., have nominated representatives to register with the Conference Preparatory Office and submitted proposals, and the situation is very enthusiastic. In addition, Lu Zhengxiang, a member of the association, also sent a congratulatory message to the Conference from Belgium a few days ago and has high hopes for this Conference. Also, anti-drug organizations, women's organizations, and social movement leaders in England, the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium are all preparing to express their cooperation with the people's groups of our country at this Conference. There have been many inquiries about the details of the Conference in recent days, and Blanc, the president of the International Anti-Drug Propaganda Society in Geneva, has even telegraphed to advocate that the Conference launch a movement to boycott narcotic drugs, imitating the method of boycotting Japanese goods, in order to use the sanctions of public opinion to achieve effective results. It is reported that the association believes that drug addiction is a fatal wound to our country and plans to make a detailed plan to submit to the Conference for thorough discussion. It is reported that this Conference will make a thorough and concrete representation to the government on the nationwide smoking ban based on the public opinion of the people of the whole country, and will request the government to guarantee that it will effectively stop the counter-propaganda and activities of those who advocate the opium public sale in order to prevent the recurrence of old evils.</p>

<h3>Case of a Japanese Man Shooting and Injuring a Chinese Policeman</h3>
<p>First Act of Trouble-Making by Dalian Rogues</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Lodged a Serious Protest</p>
<p>The Reversal of Truth by Japanese Newspapers and Propaganda</p>
<p>The details of the case in which Wang Changxing, a policeman of the Sixth Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was shot and injured by a Japanese man on Doule'an Road at 0:15 AM yesterday have been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. The Municipal Government believes that the Japanese arbitrarily shot and injured a policeman maintaining public order, which is an intentional act of provocation, and has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consulate. However, there are some details of the cause of this case that were not detailed in yesterday's newspaper, so they are supplemented as follows: At the time, the license plate number of the car carrying the Japanese was 12609, which belongs to the Zhongshan Automobile Company at 294 Zhapu Road. Beforehand, at around 11:40 PM, the Lion Hotel ordered a Chinese child to hire a car from the Zhongshan Automobile Company, driven by the driver Lu Peiwang, and drove to the hotel. At that time, three Japanese men got into the car, and another four people followed. Then, they ordered the driver to stop and wait, and the time was quite long. The driver told them that stopping for so long would cost more money, and the Japanese agreed. Later, all seven people got into the car and proceeded east on Doule'an Road and north on Doule'an Road. Then, they ordered the driver to turn back, three or four times, and their actions were very secretive. Finally, they drove to the parking lot next to the hut at the intersection of East Yokohama Road and stopped. The Japanese gave the driver a silver dollar and two jiao, and the driver was unhappy because it had been a long time and he had to add more. Unexpectedly, two Japanese men beat him. The driver ran wildly in pain to the post 30 meters away and reported to the policeman Wang Changshun. Wang then went with Lu. When several Japanese men saw the policeman coming, they suddenly stepped forward and surrounded him. One of them shot at Wang, and tried to seize the box cannon he was wearing. For self-defense, Wang also fired a shot. The Japanese started to be afraid to offend again. The gun fired by the Japanese assailant hit the center of Wang Changshun's left hand. The policeman was injured and returned to the Yokohama Bridge squad headquarters to report the emergency. At that time, it happened that Inspector Gao of the Fifth District and Chief Chen of the Police Station were patrolling here and were also violently beaten by the Japanese. The nearby Japanese Marine Corps headquarters had already sent a large number of armed Japanese soldiers to the scene to demonstrate. Soon, the Western Detective of the Disweilu Police Station heard the news and rushed to the scene. He found a blank hand-gun cartridge case on the ground, which was obviously fired by the Japanese. Because what Wang Changshun was wearing was a box cannon, the cartridge case was completely different. One of the Japanese perpetrators, Nishimura Chihiro, Matsumoto Koji, and another Taiwanese, Huang Kuanju, were arrested by the police and detained for interrogation. However, the wounds on the palm of the Japanese Matsumoto were scratches from the ground, not bullet wounds. After this incident, the residents in the vicinity were very panic-stricken and guessed that these troublemaking Japanese must be rogues who had just come to Shanghai from Dalian. Their organization is in teams of four or five people, carrying pistols, specializing in making trouble for the Chinese. Once an incident occurs, the Japanese Navy can make a big deal out of it, reverse black and white, and create a serious situation in order to carry out their poisonous plan of sabotage. Moreover, the location of the incident, at the intersection of Doule'an Road and East Yokohama Road, is very close to the Japanese Naval Marine Corps headquarters, and their deliberate sabotage is even more obvious. Also, according to another report, the details of the case of the Japanese shooting and injuring a policeman of the Public Security Bureau on East Yokohama Road have been described above. However, regarding the circumstances of the cause of this case, the local Japanese newspapers unanimously made a reversal propaganda report, obliterating the facts and trying to confuse public opinion. They insisted that the Japanese did not carry guns, that the policeman shot himself, and that the Brown Ning cartridge case found at the scene was used by the policeman. The viciousness of their framing and biting back is truly appalling. When the incident occurred, there was only one policeman, Wang Changshun, at the post. According to the regulations of the Public Security Bureau, the guns carried by the patrols are either rifles or box guns, and the patrol chiefs and above wear pistols. Since Wang Changshun is a patrol, he would naturally wear a box gun. Since there were no other police officers next to Wang, the Brown Ning cartridge case found on the ground was undoubtedly used by the Japanese. The Japanese newspaper also said that the cartridge case was put there by the police, which is unfounded and even more absurd.</p>
<h3>Second Day of the Pacific Conference of Learning</h3>
<p>Chinese Economic Issues to be Discussed in Three Days</p>
<p>Yesterday's Special Discussion on the Development of Agriculture</p>
<p>Shen Shi Telegraphic News Agency reported that yesterday was the second day of the Pacific International Learning Association conference. Before 9:00 AM, committee members from various countries had arrived at the site one after another. At 9:00 AM, the roundtable meeting began, still divided into four groups for discussion, titled "Economic Development of China." The discussion ended at nearly 10:00 AM. After a short break, the meeting continued at 11:15 AM. The groups held joint discussions, and Xia Pingfang, director of the Trust Department of the Bank of China, gave a speech on behalf of Zhang Gongquan on Chinese financial issues, and Herbert, a foreign affairs consultant of HSBC, gave a speech on foreign investment in China. At 12:15 PM, the Agenda Committee and the Chairman's Secretary held a joint meeting. At 12:45 PM, the Chinese Committee hosted a public banquet for all the committee members. From 8:30 PM to 9:15 PM, Dr. Xia Jinlin gave a speech. From 10:00 PM to 10:50 PM, the Agenda Committee held a meeting. The discussion on the economic development of China is summarized as follows.</p>
<h3>Economic Development in China</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Days for Discussion: Yesterday was the First Day, Dedicated to Discussing Agricultural Development. A Chairman of one group, during the roundtable meeting, stated that Greek civilization was based on slavery, modern European and American civilization on machinery, while Chinese civilization is based on agriculture. The area of land cultivated by Chinese people is particularly small; those exceeding fifteen acres account for only six percent, with one-third cultivating less than one acre. Furthermore, manual labor is used for cultivation, with the hope of producing food and fuel for farmers' own use. Chinese farmers account for about eighty percent of the population, and transportation across the country is mostly inconvenient. The diligence and efficiency of Chinese farmers are derived from customs and experience, and they lack modern scientific methods. Yesterday's roundtable meeting focused on agricultural education and research, and how to implement these in the actual lives of farmers. It was generally agreed that agricultural education in China is still in its infancy, but the agricultural schools established in several places in Central China, South China, and North China have achieved remarkable results. Privately established institutions are also commendable. However, to gain the trust of farmers, great skill and ingenuity are required to make them understand that the improvement of seeds, the prevention of pests, etc., are all for their benefit, and not for the self-interest of the instructors. The first step is to establish small-scale rural lending programs, providing low-interest loans to farmers, and giving them improved seeds. In their vicinity, widespread experiments should be conducted on improved planting methods, so that farmers can witness the results and emulate them. It was generally agreed that foreigners can currently assist in higher education and research, without any objection. However, the practical work must be done by the Chinese themselves. For example, Japan does not have a good agricultural experiment station in Manchuria, yet its agricultural methods still cannot influence the thirty million Chinese farmers in Manchuria. A Chinese representative said, "I am still unaware of what influence the ninety-three Japanese farmers in Manchuria have had." A Japanese representative said that Japanese people in Manchuria hardly engage in farming because Japanese people cannot compete with Chinese farmers using their own methods. Japanese emigrants in America who have learned American planting methods are now restricted by American laws and cannot apply them in America, but they can still apply them in Manchuria and compete with Chinese farmers. The interest rates for loans for Chinese farmers are very high, about 2.5% to 3% in Central China, and as high as 4% in the three northeastern provinces. In the interior, borrowing and repayment without using money can even double the interest. Therefore, establishing a rural lending system to provide low-interest loans to farmers is a necessary step in promoting agriculture. If farmers do not have funds for assistance, then knowledge of seed selection and fertilization is entirely useless. The development of rural lending in Japan was presented in an interesting way during the discussion. In the Tokugawa era, rural lending groups were formed to lend to those who bid the highest interest rate. In the Meiji era, more than fifty years ago, rural lending institutions and cooperatives were established, modeled after the German system, providing farmers with access to ordinary capital, and applying capital used for urban industry and commerce to agriculture. The tasks of these lending institutions were, first, to advance loans to farmers; and second, to cooperatively purchase supplies, sell agricultural products, and jointly rent or purchase machinery, etc. However, whether Japanese agriculture has reached the second stage is questionable. Members cannot be without funds, and the capitalist system applied to urban industry and commerce is promoted because it can provide valuable social services, thus benefiting the system. However, applying this to agriculture will be counterproductive. Farmers produce food for people, and the greater their social service, the more disadvantageous it is for themselves. The path to prosperity seems to lie in reducing this kind of service. There is currently a movement, not towards communism, but towards a cooperative form similar to Guild Socialism, which is particularly evident in Japan. Observers from the United States and Canada have also expressed doubts about whether efforts should be made to increase agricultural production at present. The issue of utilizing mountainous areas was also discussed. The majority of the Chinese representatives believed that there would probably not be much progress at present.</p>
<p>Because farmers must produce their own food and fuel, the greatest utilization of these mountainous areas lies in producing fuel. Utilizing the land on the mountain sides to plant fruit trees, raise silkworms, and extract silk has also seen some development, especially the tussah silk produced in Shandong Province, which comes from oak trees. Regarding the reorganization of land into sections to facilitate the use of machinery, it is currently not feasible. Chinese farmland is suffering from an excess of labor, so there is no need for labor-saving machinery in farming. However, simple water pumps for irrigation, and harvesting machines, etc., can be used cooperatively. The greatest uneconomical aspect of dividing land into sections is the excessive time wasted traveling from field A to field B. The comprehensive study of irrigation, forest cultivation, and flood control was also briefly discussed. One group also discussed transportation, such as the development of railways, the need for highways, and the adoption of a type of automobile transport that travels slower and is cheaper than standard commercial vehicles, and is more suitable for bad roads.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Russian Wheat to Shanghai</h3>
<p>7,000 Tons</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that 7,000 tons of Russian wheat will arrive in Shanghai on Saturday, transported by the Russian ship "Da Fulaide" from the Black Sea. This is the first time that Russian wheat has been imported into the Chinese market. It was ordered by the Da Zhonghua Company in September, with a total of 21,000 tons. It is said that the price is slightly cheaper than No. 3 Canadian wheat, about three taels and six mace per dan.</p>

<h3>Tearing Up a Page of Accounts to Conceal Evidence of Marriage</h3>
<p>Yu Qiusheng's Bigamy Trial Continues</p>
<p>Western Detective Discovers New Evidence</p>
<p>Yu Qiusheng, the owner of the Da De Rubber Factory, falsely claimed that his first wife was dead and colluded with his friend Xu Kuiqing to deceive Wang Pan, a seventeen-year-old woman from Shaoxing, into becoming his concubine under the guise of taking a second wife. After a month, Wang Pan prepared gifts to visit this promising son-in-law, and the matter was exposed. She immediately took her daughter back and reported it to the police, who filed a bigamy lawsuit against Yu. However, Yu dared to defy the law and had Xu Kuiqing and Li Yunbao, an employee of the New World Hotel, which was rented as the wedding hall on the day of the marriage, give false statements to the First Special District Court during the trial, denying that a grand ceremony was held to help Yu deny the charges. Judge Feng saw through their lies and ordered Yu Qiusheng to be released on bail after paying 2,000 yuan. Xu and Li were also each ordered to post bail and await investigation. The details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued the trial. The two lawyers representing the defendant Yu Qiusheng both found it inconvenient to continue representing Yu due to certain issues. Therefore, Yu has hired another lawyer, Wang, to appear in court to defend him. However, many of the key witnesses who were summoned did not arrive yesterday, and Xu Kuiqing also claimed to be ill and did not appear. First, Wang Pan, the mother of the plaintiff Wang Qiaoxian, described the defendant's deception, saying that Yu Qiusheng first saw her daughter at the home of a neighbor surnamed Chen in May of the lunar calendar and then conceived the idea of marrying her. He then came to her house three or four times, claiming that his wife had passed away and that he wanted to marry her daughter as a replacement. He then asked Xu Kuiqing to act as a matchmaker and set the engagement gift at 520 yuan, including 200 yuan for clothing and accessories, 200 yuan for dowry, and 120 yuan for wedding cakes. She then ordered her eldest son-in-law, Feng Bolin, to act as a matchmaker for her daughter. On the fifth day of the sixth lunar month, a red invitation was sent, and she received one of them and returned the rest. She did not pay attention to the wording of the invitation at first, so she did not read it carefully. On the ninth day of the sixth lunar month (i.e., July 23), the Yu family used a wedding car to lead a band to the Hongxiang Hotel, which she had rented as a wedding hall, to pick up the bride's auspicious attire. The wedding attire was also brought by Xu Kuiqing. The wedding hall was rented at the New World Hotel. Feng Bolin was invited to attend the ceremony. She had originally planned to return to her parents' home on the same day, but Yu firmly declined, saying that he was too busy. Therefore, she did not hold a banquet on that day and instead arranged a banquet at the Tongxing Restaurant on August 2 to invite the groom and bride to dine together and meet with relatives. However, only Yu arrived at that time, saying that the bride was sick and could not come. When she visited her son-in-law after a month, she first went to Tongdeli in the French Concession and then learned that he had moved to Zhangchuan Lane in the city. After being guided by someone, her daughter told her the whole story. She immediately questioned Qiusheng, saying, "You said your wife was dead, but why do you still have a wife? Aren't you treating my daughter as a concubine?" Qiusheng then said that she was indeed being treated as a concubine, and his tone was extremely arrogant. He also said that the matter was already done, and she could do whatever she wanted. She felt that she was being insulted too much, so she took her daughter and filed a lawsuit. Then, Western Detective Laomen of the Xinzha Police Station reported the situation of retrieving the account books at the New World Hotel, saying that in addition to the account books in the case, there was also another book. According to the manager of the hotel, surnamed Zhou, Yu Qiusheng borrowed it earlier to copy down the types of expenses on that day. However, when he returned it, he tore out a page recording that item of account. Therefore, this account book has been hidden by the general manager in an iron box for further negotiation with Yu. Zhou also said that his cousin would send the account book to the case, but Zhou has not been seen today and is presumed to be ill. At that time, the police chief's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, also submitted the account books opened by the Hongxiang Hotel to the case, saying that someone from the hotel had testified earlier, firmly claiming that the bride's family did not put up lanterns and decorations, but now, upon reading the hotel's bill, there are expenses for such items, so the hotel is also suspected of perjury. Judge Feng then examined the account books of the New World Hotel one by one. The defendant's rental of the hotel's wedding hall was on July 23, but the account items recorded in the account books were on July 26. This item of account is clearly inconsistent with Yu's account. Therefore, he asked Yu about the tearing up of the account book. Yu claimed that what he borrowed was the tea servant's record and not a ledger. The Western detective then reaffirmed that, according to Zhou's statement, it was indeed a formal account book. Later, Judge Feng adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 29th of this month because several key witnesses had not arrived, and ordered the summons of witnesses to continue the trial.</p>
<h3>Security Chief Interferes in Judicial Police</h3>
<p>Recaptures Arrested Criminal</p>
<p>Court Imposes Strict Sanctions</p>
<p>In Longwang Temple, Pudong, an elderly woman named Fu Xiao had a daughter named Jin Ying. Last year, she recruited Fu Zhangjian as her son-in-law. Unexpectedly, her nephews in the same clan, Fu Meisheng and Fu Shunsheng, coveted her property. After several quarrels, Fu Xiao made Fu Shunsheng her adopted son and divided the property equally between her daughter and adopted son. Unexpectedly, Fu Meisheng was dissatisfied because he did not get anything. In July of this year, he beat Fu Xiao, Fu Zhangjian, and Fu Jin Ying, etc. Fu Xiao, etc., filed a complaint with the local court, and after being ordered to summon them three times, the defendants refused to appear. Therefore, an arrest warrant was issued, ordering the bailiff Zhang Cheng to go and arrest them. When he went to the location yesterday morning, the plaintiff reported that Fu Meisheng was gambling in a teahouse. The police immediately went to arrest him. However, next to the teahouse was the Security Corps, and the chief, Luo Weiren, led more than ten people to seize Fu Meisheng and drag the bailiff away. Luo Weiren told him that the address written on the arrest warrant was Yanjiaqiao, and Longwang Temple was under his jurisdiction and could not be taken away. Otherwise, he would not be able to leave either. He then presented three silver dollars and asked him to take them quickly and leave quickly. If he needed anyone in the future, he should come to him. Seeing that he was outnumbered, the bailiff refused the silver dollars and refused to take the person away. Luo firmly put the silver dollars in the bailiff's clothing, threatening that if he did not take the money, he would not let him leave, etc., in order to prevent the bailiff from arresting people again in the future. The bailiff then asked for a business card and immediately returned to the court to report. After Chief Prosecutor Liu read the report, he was furious, saying that the Security Corps is a people's self-defense organization, and its duties are limited to protecting the local area and preventing bandits. It has no right to detain people. Now, it is interfering in the exercise of judicial power and seeking bribes with a mere Security Corps. What will happen to other administrative organs? If strict sanctions are not imposed, it will not be enough to maintain the prestige of the judiciary. Therefore, he immediately ordered the original handling prosecutor Wang to issue an arrest warrant, ordering police chief Xu Jinqing to supervise the bailiffs Xu Guoguang, Zhou Qiwen, Xue Bingzhang, Huang Hanqing, Zhu Baochang, Zhu Wanyuan, Zhang Chunshen, and Zhang Cheng, etc., to go to Pudong in full uniform and take Luo Weiren, Fu Meisheng, Fu Shunsheng, etc., back to the court for legal action.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Workers Destroying the Inspection Office</h3>
<p>The Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau has an inspection office, which is responsible for wharf patrols, etc. The other day, the Bureau's Xinming ship arrived in Shanghai, and several coolies stole goods and were seized by the inspection office, which aroused the anger of the workers and destroyed the inspection office. The details of this incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Theft Uncovered: The China Merchants Bureau's Beiyang ship Xinming arrived in Shanghai this time from Tianjin. While unloading the goods at Jinliyuan Wharf, three coolies stole goods such as tickets and hairy clams from the cabin of the Xinming ship. Taking advantage of the chaos of the coolies loading and unloading, they secretly hid the stolen goods, but were seen by the patrolmen of the South Wharf Inspection Office, who immediately arrested the three coolies and took them to the inspection office to await verification.</p>
<p>Workers Demand Release: After the three coolies who stole the goods were arrested by the patrolmen of the inspection office, the workers went to the inspection office in groups and demanded that the three workers be released immediately. The inspection office did not allow it, and more and more workers gathered in front of the door. Inspection director Zhu Gongshang reported to the head office on the one hand and went out to persuade the workers on the other hand, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Destruction of Objects: Because the workers' demands were ineffective, they used barbaric means and rushed into the inspection office, smashing everything they saw. All the desks and public objects in the office were destroyed. Seeing that the situation was bad, the staff temporarily avoided being injured.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Release of Workers: During the chaos, the unloading of the Xinming ship had stopped, and at the same time, it incited the Xinjiangtian ship to stop working as well. The two ships could not load or unload goods. Later, the bureau sent someone to arrive and earnestly persuade the workers, promising to release the three workers on bail and ordering them to resume work immediately so as not to hinder navigation. The matter came to an end from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The workers, having achieved their goal, began to work.</p>
<p>Bureau Investigates: Guo Waifeng, general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, specially appointed Ye Chuanfang, deputy manager of operations, to thoroughly investigate this case and report it before verifying it. Yesterday, the inspection office had already repaired and rearranged the damaged objects in the office to facilitate office work. The outcome of this matter will be reported in the future.</p>
<h3>Thugs Rob the Handgun of a Police Officer</h3>
<p>One Bandit Apprehended</p>
<p>Cong Lanbo, a police officer of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, was on duty near Linfengli, Huashun Road, at 3:30 a.m. yesterday when three thugs suddenly came out of the darkness. One of them stepped forward and asked the police officer if he could allow them to defecate in the alley. The police officer immediately replied that they could not. Unexpectedly, the three of them immediately walked into Linfengli without waiting for him to finish speaking. One bandit pretended to squat on the ground to defecate. Police officer Cong Lanbo stepped forward to intervene. Unexpectedly, the three bandits grabbed the police officer without asking the reason, and one of them used scissors to cut off his handgun belt, intending to rob the handgun he was carrying. Cong Lanbo resisted desperately in a hurry, and after fighting each other for twenty minutes, a rickshaw puller passed by the area, and the bandits fled. Later, with the help of a neighboring police officer, a bandit surnamed Gao, named Amu, was arrested and taken to the district office for interrogation. However, the two fleeing bandits had already robbed the police officer's handgun leather bag and five bullets.</p>
<h3>Statement Regarding Potato Starch Mistakenly Identified as Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>More than 3,000 pieces of potato starch from Yuanlaihang were identified by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association as Japanese goods and were resolved to be confiscated by the sixth executive committee meeting and reported to the municipal party headquarters for review. The company claimed that the potato starch was not Japanese goods and collected various conclusive evidence to apply for reconsideration by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Wu Hankang, the manager of the company, also presented a statement to the municipal party headquarters, stating that the potato starch was not Japanese goods and was mistakenly detained and confiscated. He respectfully requested review of the matter. The merchant's Yuanlaihang, which he manages, specializes in selling goods from various islands in the South Seas, and also acts as an agent for overseas Chinese to buy and sell, and has been trading directly with Dutch, German, American, British, and Austrian companies for many years. It has never sold Japanese goods. Since June 19 of the Republic of China, it has successively ordered Dutch potato starch, also known as raw starch, from factories in Hamburg and Berlin, Germany, and transported it to Shanghai for sale many times. Before August 13 and 15 of this year, the inspection section of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee mistakenly identified the company's potato starch as Japanese goods and successively seized 3,346 pieces at Lujia Ferry and Yuanlai Warehouse, etc. Evidence was presented at the time to explain, and some understanding was gained. On September 3, a notice was received that the eighth executive committee meeting resolved that the goods were Dutch goods masquerading as Japanese goods and should be fined 3,000 yuan to help disaster relief, and the goods should be returned, etc. In order to quickly settle the matter, the merchant paid the amount in full and obtained a receipt dated September 4 and a notice of release. All matters have been concluded, but when going to the inspection section warehouse to collect the goods, the section delayed issuing the bill of lading. After repeated urging, it was ineffective and the goods were never returned. On the 16th of this month, it was suddenly seen in Shen Xin and other newspapers that the sixth executive committee meeting of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association had resolved to confiscate all of the above-mentioned potato starch, which was very frightening. The merchant's patriotism has never dared to lag behind others. If goods that are not Japanese goods are mistakenly identified as Japanese goods, they should be declared first. If they are resolved to be confiscated again, the economic loss is great, and the loss of reputation is huge. He immediately collected various conclusive evidence, prepared to request reconsideration, and first sent a letter to the association stating the matter. Upon seeing the report yesterday, he respectfully submitted a statement to the department, requesting an inspection. All reasons and evidence for requesting reconsideration, etc., will be submitted again later, combined with this statement.</p>
<h3>Jiangjing Ship Rescued</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ship Jiangjing ran aground six miles downstream from Anqing. The bureau sent the Yushun ship to tow it. After two days, the telegram was received yesterday that the ship had been towed out.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Announces General Reduction of Rush Grain Tax</h3>
<p>Approved at Seven Li Per Fen by a Provincial Order. The Shanghai County Finance Bureau announced yesterday that, according to the records of the Nianfen rush grain tax to be collected in the county, the autumn harvest was poor. After the districts reported to the county, the commissioners of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Agriculture, and Mining Departments were ordered to go to the county to inspect the four villages in detail and calculate the amount of tax reduction. The meeting submitted a report, but the Finance Department rejected it. After repeated requests by telegram, the Finance Department sent a cold telegram stating that although there was more rainfall in this year's autumn harvest in the county, there was no major damage. The previous request to reduce one fen was not approved. Therefore, the department tentatively decided to increase the levy by three li, changing it to a general reduction of seven li, with an actual levy of nine fen and three li. This is the final decision and no further objections may be raised. You should immediately follow these instructions, create a table of registration and send it for verification, without delay, etc. Upon receiving this order, we should follow the instructions and handle it. All busy taxes that were collected earlier in the year, and busy silver that was completed in tax reduction, should be deducted in the amount that rush silver will be completed next year and offset against the new tax. In addition to ordering the creation of a serial register of grain rice books and setting a date to start the tax collection, we will also create a complete list of silver rice books and submit them. This announcement should be posted so that all business owners will be notified. This is the announcement.</p>
<h3>Selling Alleged Antidotes Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>Health Bureau Alerts Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice stating: It has been reported that recently some individuals have been peddling alleged antidotes to citizens, falsely claiming that due to the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the bureau, concerned about the pollution of the city's water source, has specially manufactured these antidotes for sale to citizens to dissolve in the water to prevent infection, etc. However, this bureau has not manufactured or sold any medications. This is clearly a fraudulent scheme by unscrupulous individuals to swindle money. Should such false representations be encountered in the future, citizens are urged to immediately report them to the police on duty, who will detain the suspects at the local precinct, and to also report to this bureau for thorough investigation. Furthermore, this bureau has always emphasized integrity in handling all health-related matters. If anyone attempts to extort money under any pretext, they can be reported with confidence, and we will conduct a fair investigation without any leniency. However, all businesses should also proactively focus on public health to prevent unscrupulous individuals from taking advantage of opportunities for extortion. Moreover, this bureau has not dispatched anyone to solicit donations. Any request for money under any pretext is also a fraudulent act and should be reported immediately for investigation. It is hoped that everyone will pay close attention to these matters.</p>
<h3>Soviet Kerosene Dumping in China</h3>
<p>Talk by Mr. Libanov, General Manager of the Trust</p>
<p>Content of the Contract Signed with Guanghua Company</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Soviet Russian Kerosene Trust is dumping kerosene in China, starting operations first in Shanghai, and has repeatedly consulted with Guanghua Kerosene Company, etc., as reported in various newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter from this agency interviewed Mr. Libanov, General Manager of the Trust, to inquire about the details. Mr. Libanov answered as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua Kerosene Company is a limited liability company organized by Chinese merchants. The company is well-managed and enjoys a high reputation. I have come to your country as a representative of this Trust to sign a contract with the company to promote and sell kerosene in China. It is the only kerosene company in China whose managers possess commercial talent and have considerable experience in promoting kerosene. They have agencies throughout China and should have no problem selling 1.5 million gallons of kerosene per month. The company has a kerosene processing plant in Shanghai, which is very well-equipped, with several oil storage tanks and various modern machines, providing everything needed for the oil business. Soviet kerosene production is abundant, ranking third among oil-producing countries in the world. However, recently, other oil-producing countries have been affected by unstable economic conditions, resulting in reduced oil production. Therefore, the Soviet Union has become the second largest oil-producing country in the world in recent years. The current kerosene production of the Soviet Union is actually two and a half times more than the record before the Russian war. The Trust's original five-year oil industry plan can now be fully achieved in two and a half years, based on the actual work in the first half of this year, instead of five years. The so-called five-year plan means intensifying work to double the annual kerosene production to 46 million tons by the end of the fifth year. With the increase in Soviet kerosene production, the number of kerosene exports will certainly increase accordingly. In 1929-1930, the Soviet Union exported 4.62 million tons of kerosene, which is about five times higher than the highest number before the Russian war. Soviet kerosene is not only selling well in the United States but is also popular all over the world. I (Mr. Libanov) am now indicating the amount of kerosene produced in the Soviet Union so that it is clear that there is no difficulty for the Soviet Union to supply a portion of the needs of the Chinese market. China's annual consumption of various kerosene oils is only 1 million tons. The contract signed between this Trust and Guanghua Company states that the General Manager of Guanghua Company will promote and sell kerosene from the Soviet Kerosene Trust in fifteen provinces in China. The contract is for a period of five years. After the various sales matters are completed, the Guanghua Kerosene Company will begin sales. They have already placed an order with this Trust for a batch of kerosene. The goods will be transported and sold to various places by Guanghua Company. The oil tanker "Owen" is loaded with 3.1 million gallons of kerosene. The oil was loaded at the port of Poti (transliteration) in the Black Sea on September 22, passing through the four port (transliteration). The entire journey takes 33 days and will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. According to the contract, all kerosene sold will be transported from the Black Sea by several oil tankers through the Don River (transliteration) to Shanghai. The reporter further asked whether Guanghua Company would be the exclusive agent for all kinds of oil products from the Soviet Union in the future. Mr. Libanov replied that the contract signed with Guanghua Company states that it will only manage kerosene in the fifteen provinces south of the Yellow River in China. Guanghua Company can sell all kinds of oils such as car oil, machine oil, and diesel oil throughout China, but this condition is not stated in the contract, and the Trust has full authority to negotiate other sales methods with other Chinese merchants. The reporter also asked what rules and regulations the Soviet kerosene would adopt when it is sold in China in the future, and whether it would affect the business of other kerosene experts in the world. Mr. Libanov replied that the Soviet Union will adopt independent rules and regulations when selling kerosene in China. In order to protect their own positions, kerosene producers in the world must have considerable considerations. However, the future activities of the Soviet Kerosene Trust will be carried out in accordance with the appropriate business methods already used by other companies. They will never use the method of price competition to suppress the sales of other companies. If price competition occurs, all kerosene experts will not benefit from it. I firmly believe that this kind of activity will not occur. If the Soviet Kerosene Trust is excluded and cannot gain a foothold in China, the Soviet Union will certainly have considerable ability to resist such disputes. All organizations in China will not retreat. Because the kerosene produced in the Soviet Union is of high quality and the price is equal to other companies, I firmly believe that it will sell well in the market. Otherwise, how could the Soviet kerosene, which was transported by the American kerosene company and sold by Guanghua Company, gain a foothold in China?</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Bans Small Champagne Tickets</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau had previously received reports that the Sino-Foreign Friendship Society was issuing charitable small champagne tickets, divided into two types: fifty cents and one yuan. The prize redemption location was at No. 1 Beijing Road, and the prize money was deposited in Mei Feng Bank. The lottery would be drawn according to the charitable grand champagne number on October 25, etc. The bureau immediately sent personnel to various places to investigate. According to the reply, No. 1 Beijing Road is Jardine Matheson. According to the compradore of the foreign firm, the firm does not have a prize redemption location for the Sino-Foreign Friendship Society. Mei Feng Bank also stated that there were no such deposits, etc. The bureau is still sending personnel to secretly investigate and crack down.</p>

<h3>Respectfully Informing All Yarn Factories in the Country about the Yarn Industry Shaochang</h3>
<p>(The item of boycotting cotton yarn is enough to control Japan's fate. I hope that Chinese merchants will expand their equipment with the huge profits gained from boycotting Japan, so that supply and demand can match, and workers who leave Japanese factories can be employed and benefit more.)</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese invasion of our Eastern Provinces, public sentiment has been indignant, and the call to resist Japanese goods has been widespread. This is the ninth boycott of Japanese goods since the establishment of the Republic of China. Looking back on the past, every one of them started with excitement and generosity, but ended with disappearance and silence. Speaking of our yarn industry, we have many more feelings about this, because Japanese goods coming to China, cotton yarn is the most important, and it is also an indispensable item for the lives of compatriots across the country. If everything is boycotted, and cotton yarn is not boycotted, then it is equivalent to not boycotting other things. If none of the other things are boycotted, and only the item of cotton yarn can make Japanese products disappear in our Chinese land, then it can make the three islands of Japan stagnate in production, increase unemployment, and cause economic depression. If our country persists in this way, and controls its fate, then the crisis in the Eastern Provinces can be resolved, and the alliance under the city can be avoided. It is a pity that it is still too early to say this today. Although the domestic yarn industry in our country has developed rapidly in recent years, it still cannot compete with Japanese commercial yarn sellers for even a single day. The quality cannot compete with imported goods, and the supply and demand are disparate. The output of the factory cannot satisfy the needs of the whole country. In addition, the factory management is not in place, and there is no research on business aspects. Even commercial ethics are weak, and they do not care about the overall situation of the country, the future of the industry, or even take it into account. I am saying this for the sake of my colleagues, and I am truly sighing. If the supply is insufficient to meet the demand, and this is also a daily necessity, then how can the boycott be sustained? Therefore, those who destroy the anti-Japanese resistance are not necessarily the merchants and profiteers who are blinded by profit, but are also forced by the situation and cannot avoid it. Since the Fresh Case occurred, the people's anger has been tense, and Japanese yarn has been rejected by our people. Therefore, the sales of Chinese yarn have shown a vigorous trend again. All gangs compete to advance, and even tens of thousands of packages of ten-strand yarn have been depleted. The price of yarn has risen sharply, while the price of raw cotton has fallen, and the cost is lighter. The profits are so great that they have not been seen in recent years. The Japanese merchants and yarn factories have taken advantage of the opportunity to dump a large batch of 70,000 to 80,000 packages at a price of more than 20 taels lower than Chinese yarn per package. However, although Japanese yarn is more than 20 taels lower than Chinese yarn, it still has a surplus of more than 10 taels in terms of cost. Then the profits of Chinese yarn are knowable. Recently, I read the letter from the United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories to the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Association, stating that the price of Chinese yarn will not rise due to the boycott of Japanese goods. I am somewhat confused about this. The price of goods fluctuates due to supply and demand, which is known to everyone. If in normal times, the demand exceeds the supply, then we cannot criticize the increase in the price of goods. This is a special time, which is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood of our country, and it is also the key to the success or failure of this anti-Japanese resistance. Since the price of Chinese yarn is higher than that of Japanese yarn, even if the price is not increased now, has the function of pooling wisdom and efforts to the utmost been fulfilled? Or is there anything more? Wealthy merchants and officials, whose pockets are filled with money, are all wearing wool, serge, or domestically produced silk. In fact, most of my poor compatriots wear cloth clothes. If the cheap Japanese yarn disappears, and the expensive Chinese yarn does not reduce the price, then my poor civilians will not suffer from the burden of rising cloth prices, and those who get huge profits are not enjoying the benefits of the anti-Japanese movement? In other words, are they not taking advantage of the national misfortune to gain blessings? For the sake of the national situation, the livelihood of the civilians, and the business itself, it is better to use this huge and accidental profit to expand internal capital, or add spinning machines, or set up factories, so that supply and demand can match, the profits are greater, and the patriotic workers who leave the Japanese factories can also have a place to be employed. This is a win-win plan. I hope that Chinese yarn factories can implement it. After the Fresh Case, the anti-Japanese atmosphere was not vigorous for a while, but if there had been no Shenyang Incident, then the energy could be exhausted within ten days, and the previous anti-Japanese movement would become a fleeting bubble. It was not until the violent Japanese occupied my territory, massacred my people, and burned my houses that they knew that the disaster of national subjugation was imminent. Therefore, those colleagues who used to specialize in Japanese yarn knew fear and could also endure the pain to sacrifice in the hope of gathering the public's will to become a city and saving the country with conscience. Now try to ask anyone in the market about the yarn industry after the boycott, and they will definitely sigh and lament that they will be in panic of being unemployed, because the productive capacity of my country's yarn factories is too weak. If the factories that are making huge profits now do not urgently plan to expand, and the capitalists outside the industry have no intention of investing, then those who are now sacrificing in the yarn industry will have the worry of running out of food, and the future of the boycott will be even more hopeless.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, The news item in your newspaper's "Local News" column on the 18th of this month, stating that the Justice Law Firm will be established, is not true. This law firm has always been located on the third floor of No. 48 Sichuan Road. In addition, it has not formed a joint law firm with any lawyer. In addition to a thorough investigation, I am writing to your newspaper to check and correct the matter quickly to clarify the facts.

<p>The Sound of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Parents beat their children, and the children offer themselves to the whip. This is called filial piety. Older brothers reprimand younger siblings, and the younger siblings humbly accept the training. This is called respect. Now, Japan is invading our Northeast, slaughtering our soldiers and civilians, and our country is responding with non-resistance. I wonder what this is called. The fields of the Northeast do not need fertilizer for cultivation. The soybeans of the Northeast can be considered the best in the world. (Nearly five hundred varieties) The forests and minerals are sufficient to meet the needs of the whole country for hundreds of years. If Japan had not invaded, how would those of us who have no money to study, and those who study only for love, know this kind of wisdom about the Northeast?</p>
<p>Foreigners ridicule us for having only five minutes of enthusiasm. If foreigners are referring to one person, then we have 200 million minutes when calculated by 400 million people. More than 33.333 million hours can be heated up in order, which is quite self-satisfied.</p>

<h3>The Last Scene of a Good Government</h3>
<p>In 1922, Hu Shi drafted a "Our Political Propositions" and published it. The names listed included Wang Chonghui, Cai Yuanpei, Luo Wengan, and Hu Shi himself, totaling sixteen people. In this manifesto, they advocated establishing a government. The political reforms of a good government include three basic principles: first, a constitutional government; second, an open government; and third, a planned political system. Later, Wang Chonghui had a successful career and actually became the Premier, and Luo Wengan also became the Minister of Finance. At this time, the good people thought that the time was ripe to implement their own propositions. Everyone organized a political discussion meeting, which was held every Friday. After several meetings, Premier Wang always refused to announce his major policies, which made everyone very impatient. Once I went to Beijing, and it happened to be Friday, so my friends pulled me to participate in the discussion. My record is:</p>
<p>"Cai Yuanpei" Chairman</p>
<p>Hu Shi stood up:</p>
<p>"Based on our political propositions, we want to ask Premier Wang to announce his major policies and plans."</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui went on stage and said a bunch of rambling complaints for a full hour. Finally, he said in a particularly loud voice:</p>
<p>"Hu Shi! You want me to announce a plan, I have no plan! No plan is my plan..."</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei: "This discussion of ours was originally set up for exchanging knowledge. Now, such a quarrel will only hurt feelings. It's better not to hold it. If everyone agrees, we will adjourn this meeting from now on."</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with Cai's proposal, and the play of the "good government" closed from then on.</p>
<h3>Wu Tingfang and Ito Hirobumi</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Japan is able to be so ferocious and so strong. Of course, it must be attributed to the Meiji Restoration. Looking back, although China was poor and weak fifty years ago, it was fully exposed. But compared with Japan, it was even more so. However, after only ten years, my great China was defeated by the Japanese. The reason for this is that after the Japanese Restoration, people were employed properly. The Chinese Qing government could not employ talents. At that time, there was no lack of talent in China. However, the students who studied in the West were often envied in the officialdom after returning to China and could not be employed. It is said that at that time, there was a student studying abroad who worked under Li Hongzhang. His monthly salary was only seven taels of silver.</p>
<h3>Going to National Crisis</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Alas, the fate of the country is now at this point. I only feel that the day is coming to an end. The country is full of tears. When I get up and look around, I am glad that the hearts of the people are not dead. There is an ancient saying that sorrow can rejuvenate the country. The people of the country can unite against the outside world. Even if the violent sun is savage, it is not enough to worry about. Every time I read Yue Wumu's "Man Jiang Hong" lyrics, I have the thought of reining in my horse at Guanshan and swinging my knife across the world. Because I feel that the lyrics are difficult to understand, but the feeling is really deep. So I wrote this song. It's time to go to the national crisis. There is power to help with power, and there is money to help with money. Working hard to stay as a slave is better than fighting with the enemy to decide who is the hero. Sitting and waiting for people to confiscate the property is better than being selfless and forgetting private interests. The Northeast has been looted, and the Central Plains are spreading again. Like carp, warships are coming endlessly, and the ports of the rivers and seas are in danger again. The League of Nations and the Non-War Treaty, paper tigers are not enough to look forward to. Justice has been lost for a long time. Where can we know right and wrong? The country and the nation are originally supported by strong forces. Strengthen their wisdom. The fate of prosperity and decline is in the hands of learning. Strengthen their courage. The luck of prosperity and decline is supported by force. Reading the Book of Filial Piety when disaster is imminent. Who can understand the words? It's time to go to the national crisis.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to go to the national crisis. Endure my divine descendants to be humiliated by those snakes and insects. Tian Heng has righteous men. He would rather sacrifice on the island than submit. Gou Jian suffered his ambition. Poor pawns were destroyed. This heart is not a mat of straw. Don't be suspicious when the opportunity comes. Some say that the ignorant people forget the country but not the wealth. With wealth, the family can go to all countries. Ning is suffering from the disaster of one country. Some say that the ignorant people falsely recognize a hill of moss. China and Japan are the same race. It doesn't matter if he comes. What day is today? How can we blame each other? The people of the country are all wise. There is no such idiocy. I believe that 400 million people have the same hatred and do not know shame. The enemy is already in front of you. You are still mocking yourself. These people have been dead for a long time. It is really sad to say. Don't hesitate to go to the national crisis.</p>
<p>Silver. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China was defeated. Li Hongzhang was sent to Japan to negotiate the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Li Hongzhang was very surprised to see the development of Japanese industry and the wealth of the military. At the meeting, he asked Ito why Japan's progress was so rapid and why China was so backward. Ito replied to Li Hongzhang that China's poverty and backwardness were due to its inability to employ true talents. Li Hongzhang replied that China was short of talents and that the government wanted to employ good talents, but it was difficult to find them at one time. Ito said that when he was studying in the West, he had a classmate named Wu Tingfang. Wu Tingfang's knowledge was much higher than his. He asked why the Qing government had not employed this person.</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang heard the news and could not find the name of Wu Tingfang in his stomach. Later, after returning to China, he inquired for a long time before he knew where Wu Tingfang lived. At that time, Wu Tingfang was working as a lawyer in Hong Kong, hanging a foreign lawyer's license. He could earn one or two taels of silver a month. At that time, there were no lawyers in China. Li Hongzhang sent someone to Hong Kong to invite him to be an official in the Qing court. Wu Tingfang always refused. At that time, Li Hongzhang promised him a monthly salary of 500 taels, thinking that it was a lot. But Wu Tingfang earned more than this in Hong Kong. Finally, Li Hongzhang tried his best to donate an official title for him and sent him to be an envoy. From this point alone, we can know the darkness of the Qing court. The improper use of people led to the weakness of the country and the poverty of the people, which led to unimaginable situations. When Wu Tingfang was employed, the civilization of others had already progressed a lot and could not catch up. This is also a major reason why Japan is stronger than China.</p>
<h3>Pu Ya's Birthday Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>This year's October 21 is the 69th birthday of Mr. Ye Huijun, a well-known figure in Shanghai. Because it happens to be a time of national crisis, Mr. Ye is unwilling to be extravagant. Therefore, he only displayed the good works given by his relatives and friends at the Cuixiu Hall in the Yimiao to provide a glimpse for the guests. There was no banquet and everything was simple and elegant. It was different from ordinary birthday celebrations and was worthy of recording for imitation. I would like to record what I saw and heard that day as follows. It is also what those who are determined to improve customs like to hear.</p>
<p>Above the hall was a birthday character hall scroll written by the Lingxuehui Jintai Manweng. The brushwork was majestic and different from the others. Beside it was a couplet given by Yang Shuzhuang. The text reads: "Bamboo shoots and ferns are on top of the fast food, and the heart transcends the three thousand realms." "The dogwood will be in the next year. Healthy walking has lasted seventy autumns." There were no incense candles on the table, only silver cups, silver cauldrons, and silver shields sent by various public groups and friends. The four walls were covered with three halls of birthday screens. Below were dozens of pots of pine, cypress, and yellow chrysanthemums. After the guests appreciated the various good works, they were entertained with tea and refreshments. Mr. Ye was elected by the Shanghai people as the representative to Guangdong to petition for peace and had contacted Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, and others in Guangzhou. The representative sent by Guangdong to attend the peace conference also happened to come to Shanghai that day. Therefore, he personally went to the pier to welcome him. People from all walks of life who went to celebrate his birthday were generally received by the son</p>
<h3>Mr. Liu Haisu's Reflections on Art Studies During His European Tour (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>I also opened two Chinese modern art exhibitions in Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany. The exhibitions were very popular with enthusiastic visitors. The news spread rapidly throughout the various states of Germany. Because of this, I feel even more strongly that international artistic exchange can showcase the greatness of Chinese art and is a very important aspect of cultural promotion abroad. One day, Li Peima, the president of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Koumeier, the curator of the Oriental Art Museum, and Dr. Schalf, the president of the Oriental Art Association, visited me. We discussed ways to organize a Chinese modern art exhibition in Berlin. Finally, the embassy officially signed an agreement with the Oriental Art Association to hold the exhibition in February 1934. It would be co-sponsored by China and Germany, with the Prussian Academy of Arts as the venue. Ten German committee members were nominated. On the Chinese side, the Minister and Vice Minister of Education, the President of the Academia Sinica, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, and myself were initially designated as committee members to begin preparations. The remaining six members would be appointed later.</p>
<p>That day, Li Peima said to me, "The previous German-Japanese joint exhibition was mainly organized by the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts of Japan. If China and Germany co-organize an exhibition next time, which organization will be the main body on the Chinese side?" I said, "China will use the Academia Sinica as the main body." He asked, "The Prussian Academy of Arts has a history of forty years, and the Japanese Imperial Academy of Fine Arts has twenty-seven years. How many years has the Academia Sinica been around?" I replied, "It's only been four or five years now, but historically speaking, it has a history of over a thousand years, because national art academies were established as early as the Tang and Song dynasties." They were very familiar with the situation in China, so they were even more aware that our country's art does indeed have a long history. He also asked, "What kind of paintings will you bring to our next exhibition for us to appreciate?" I replied, "We will bring paintings that Chinese artists have created according to their own wishes and ask the artists of your country to offer guidance." The meaning was to satirize Japan for specializing in artifice and deception, exhausting themselves in creating paintings to cater to European psychology and deceive Europeans. We are unwilling to do things that way. Li said again, "That's right. The paintings that we Germans want to appreciate are the natural paintings that we want to see in our hearts, not paintings that are made solely for display in an exhibition." At this point, Li asked me to paint a light ink landscape painting. I immediately painted it based on the meaning of "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual consonance and lifelike expression). Li looked at it carefully and commented, "The Japanese painter Koho Tsuyurei also painted a light ink landscape painting a month ago. Its power and artistic conception are far inferior. Because of this, I believe that the Chinese Modern Art Exhibition in 1934 will definitely give us satisfaction."</p>
<p>In the past three years, I have comprehensively reviewed the art facilities in various European countries. The scale is grand and the meaning is profound. I can't help but sigh in surprise. Looking back on the rich artistic achievements of our country for thousands of years, they far surpass those of Europe. It is most regrettable that there is a lack of strategies for preservation and development, and that they are buried under weeds, so that future scholars have no way to touch and appreciate the works of the past and find it difficult to deeply pursue further studies in modern times. All my colleagues in the art world should rise up and strive for the revival movement of art.</p>
<p>acting as host. Mr. Ye was a member of the Tongmenghui. During the recovery of Shanghai, he led members of the merchant corps to attack the Manufacturing Bureau. In the first year of the Republic, he escorted Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the capital to assume the position of Provisional Grand President. He did not seek fame after his success, and still sought public welfare in the locality, engaging in commerce. He was righteous and courageous, and spoke his mind frankly. Whenever he attended meetings and gave speeches, he was able to speak eloquently, incorporating humor into solemnity, so everyone was pleased. Although he was approaching his seventies, he was still full of energy, and younger people lamented that they were not as good. The poems and articles given by relatives and friends this time encouraged him in their congratulations because of his frankness. The following are excerpts from what I remember. Huang Yanpei said, "Enemy ships are at the door, and our borders are occupied. The country is in danger like today. How can we be at ease to celebrate birthdays? With a loyal heart and righteous courage like yours, how can you bear to receive congratulations? I am willing to risk my old life to bravely kill the enemy and return our rivers and mountains to us, so that the ancient country of five thousand years can return from old age to youth. At that time, I will specially offer a cup of wine to wish you and the Republic of China a happy old age together. I, Hui Jun, think it is as safe as Mount Tai." Pan Yangyao presented a seven-ancient poem, which deeply expressed the current affairs. The text said, "The Japanese sword splattered blood on the Liaodong Island, and the brothers fought each other, how can the country be safe? When the times are dangerous, you alone stand up and are willing to be an elder who reconciles the times. You travel thousands of miles to the Southern Sea, forgetting your temples in the face of great righteousness. You were originally a merchant, and you joined the party early. You worked hard to restore Chu, emulating the loyalty of an orphan, and you were willing to smear your brain rather than submit to Qin. A man's aspirations are like spring thunder, and wealth and fame are like autumn grass. You happily return to your original clothes, and still manage your rice paddies. You don't want to spend your life idly, and you lead the business world to seek transformation. You count your life's extraordinary deeds and strange ideas, and your outstanding reputation is often recorded. Alas! A country without inaction is a treasure, and doing good is a treasure. Heaven blesses good people and increases their longevity. May the crane's age reach the age of eighty, may the moon be forever round, and may the flowers be forever beautiful." Shao Lizi presented a seven-character poem, saying, "Not allowed to leisurely sing a birthday song, I always think of the country's difficulties and tears flow horizontally. It is good to rely on a strong body to support the critical situation, and there is still a red heart to call for peace. Pingfu was the first to plan for prosperity and wealth, and he has fought all his life learning the art of business and war. Heaven should grant him a long life, and work together to support the collapsing mansion."</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Dreams (21)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Could it be that the people here are all immortal?"</p>
<p>"We only live forever in the joy of the present, there is no such thing as old age or death; if there were old age and death, we would not be able to maintain our present joy, we have overthrown old age and death."</p>
<p>While Tao Chi was answering questions with the others at the table, another team of dancing girls came, dressed in colorful clothes, displaying their modern dance skills in front of the table; Tao Chi watched with enthusiasm, drinking several cups of modern wine, he became even more intoxicated in the joy of the present, he even more felt that the past sorrows were meddlesome, the future hopes were delusions; he only sought the present happiness, and lived forever in this long-lasting and unchanging present life.</p>
<p>The dancing girls finished dancing the modern dance, and then sang modern songs:</p>
<p>丨丨 Modern Songs 丨丨</p>
<p>The red sun is in the sky, the long rope is hit, tied again and again;</p>
<p>The past and the future are all overthrown, only the present will never change; 丨丨 the character "bian" rhymes with "bi".</p>

<p>Tao Chi listened to this modern song that only cared about the present happiness, his soul broke into the palace of bewilderment, he seemed to see in that palace of bewilderment, hanging many slogans, he only remembered the following three:</p>
<p>"Only care about the present, don't care about anything else!"</p>
<p>"Friends, don't ask about the past humiliations, don't think about the future difficulties, you just seek your present revelry!"</p>

<h3>Gold Market Shows Slight Reaction</h3>
<p>The entire day was extremely volatile. Yesterday, the 22nd, the gold price suddenly experienced major changes, with storms and waves surging, advancing and retreating suddenly, with unstoppable momentum. The entire day had a difference of sixteen taels. In the morning market, initially due to the League of Nations' hesitation towards Japan, coupled with the British advocating the use of silver, the price weakened to within 710 taels. Subsequently, the exchange rate changed from loose to firm, and the posted price was reduced. The buying side on the market saw renewed excitement, suddenly turning to a high peak, and surging by 10 taels. In the afternoon market, it once exceeded the 720 tael mark, truly due to the extreme tightness of exchange drafts, and repeated contractions. This was mainly due to the buying momentum of large players. However, many parties took the opportunity to unload, and market sentiment suddenly turned weak. Therefore, it fell sharply by five or six taels. In the end, compared to the previous day, it fell by more than two taels, and the situation was chaotic, making it difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Opening Lower then Rising  The opening of the market saw a drop of 9 taels and 4 qian to 709 taels for large bars and a drop of a quarter for silver prices.  However, due to the current situation and the fact that Yuanmao, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Tongtaichang, Fuchang, and others were selling, and the exchange market seemed to be easing, with banks mutually trading US dollars at 32.0625 yuan and British gold needing to be sold at 17.5 yuan, the price continued to fall. It then fell from 710 taels to 05 taels and 7 qian. Before long, Zhifeng, Yongyu, Hehong, Kangyonghengchangyong, and others came to buy in, and in just over ten minutes, it rose to 10 taels and 8 qian. HSBC initially posted British gold as before, and US dollars lengthened by 125, as it had retreated to 08 taels and 2 qian. A while later, it went from 10 taels and 2 qian to 07 taels and 7 qian, and market sentiment was calm. Around 9:50, the bank bought recent British gold at 17.5, and the forward contract settled at 17.375. Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongqian, Shixiang, Daxing, Yongyuanmao, and exchange traders were all paying in, so the price jumped 5 taels to 10 o'clock, reaching 12 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, due to Tongtaichang, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yongshunli, and others selling, US dollars needed to be sold at 32.125 yuan, which caused the market to suddenly become exhausted and immediately fell by 6 or 7 taels. At 10:30, it was only 06 taels. Afterwards, British gold and others recovered, and recent transactions were done at 17.375, and then the January contract was at 17.1875. Therefore, it showed a trend of solidity again. Yuanmao, Yonghengchangyong, Yifeng, Yongqianchangxiang, and Yuda all showed strong buying interest, and the gold price soared, exceeding 10 taels. Furthermore, British gold changed by 125 and US dollars by 25, reaching 16 taels at 11:30. However, goods traders and retail investors had already sold, and the Indian exchange rate reported "Da Er Anna", so it fell by two or three taels again. The noon close was 13 taels and 2 qian, and continued to trade to within 12 taels, and then to 13 taels. The opening price was initially 706 taels, and later calculated at 766 or 767 taels, with a discount of around 50 taels.  The result was a return of a small 2 taels and 3 qian.  The afternoon market opened at 12 taels and 2 qian, then went from 13 taels to 12 taels. Transactions were sporadic. Later, due to the continued presence of more buyers, it suddenly rose 3 taels to 15 taels and 2 qian. At 2:30, it suddenly lost 2 taels, reaching 13 taels, which was truly due to the inconsistent movements on the market. However, there were no large tickets. It was learned that British gold was trading at a small 125 and US dollars at 25 on the domestic market, and the domestic market was also firm. It was estimated that banks absorbed British gold at 1875 and US dollars at 31.8125, with both inflows and outflows being possible. The gold price then increased slightly by one or two taels, but there was a fluctuation of one tael. Until 2:45, it suddenly showed brilliance. Yifeng, Hengxing, Hengshi, Yongda, Decheng, Daxing, Yongyuansheng, Tongtaichang, Cuichang, Yongzhifengyong, etc., all came to compete for purchases. In addition, the British gold merchant absorbed 17, so market sentiment was high, and it surged by eight or nine taels. At 3:20, it reached a high peak of 722 taels. Unexpectedly, Tongtaichang and others sold out, retreating to 18 taels and a half. In an instant, British gold shrank again by 125 and US dollars by 375, only 21 taels were left. However, Zhifengyong, Neixingheng, Yuda Lianbang, etc., all sold out, causing the price to fail to hold and collapsing by four or five taels. However, from 4:00 to 4:30, there was a fluctuation of more than 2 taels, and the closing price was 16 taels and 1 qian, which was 2 taels and 3 qian lower than the previous day, which was truly unexpected. The largest price in the entire city was 22 taels, and the smallest was 05 taels and 7 qian, a difference of 16 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<p>Net Premium Adds 11 Taels.  The early morning market for goods was 08 taels and a half, the noon close was 12 taels, and the afternoon was 12 taels and 2 qian. The closing price was 16 taels, and the posted price was changed to over 780 taels, with an estimated discount of 70 taels.  The logged price was 13 taels, and the water compensation was 13 taels in the morning and 16 taels in the afternoon.  The net premium added 11 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions Chaotic and Uncoordinated  The market was chaotic and uncoordinated. According to statistics, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, Yuankangxiang, Yifengyuanmao, Yongdaxingyong, Yuanxingyong, and others were buying in. Shunlifuchang, Futaiheng, and others were selling out. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yuantaiyuhe, and Yuanmaodadechengdakang were in very troublesome ins and outs. Qianchangxiang was buying more and selling less. Mr. Wu had ins and outs from time to time, and exchange traders were divided, so the ins and outs were inconsistent. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Yifengqianchangxiang, Chenfengyong, Daxingyongyuancheng, Cuichangyong, Yuanchunfu, Yuanyuhong, and Yonghengchangyongfutaihengjuchangxiangfayongdadecheng all bought in. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Yifengyongheng, Yubingxingyuankangxiang, Zhifengyong, and others all sold out. Yuantaiyuanmao Yong and others went in and out from time to time, and the situation was very lively. Dalianbang sold 2,300 to 400 items and bought in 1,100 items. Only now has the dominant position been occupied. Guangbang bought 1,000.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Posts Three Consecutive Contractions</h3>
<p>Estimating Two Contractions···Domestic Market Also Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian and silver markets all saw declines again, and the exchange rate continued to rise. Thus, the British gold in Shanghai became even tighter. However, the US dollar was not very strong. HSBC posted three consecutive contractions, estimating two contractions, (British gold contracted a total of half a penny, and US dollars contracted 75). It did not change from the initial posting in the morning. However, the US dollar lengthened by 125 due to squeezing the exchange rate, to 31.875 yuan. The other exchanges changed slightly. At 11:30, British gold changed to contract 125 and US dollars contracted 25. At 2:30 in the afternoon, it again contracted 125 and US dollars contracted 25. At 3:40, the third contraction was 125, currently at 1 shilling 6 pence 875 and US dollars at 375, estimating 31 yuan. Among the other exchanges, only Hong Kong never moved, remaining at 78 taels, and the rest all became more expensive. The domestic market loosened and then tightened, and was particularly strong in the afternoon. The British gold result was 375 contractions compared to the previous noon, and the US dollar contracted only 1875. However, the gold market had many twists and turns, with both the front and rear markets seeing 10 tael rebounds. In the end, it wilted, which was truly because the situation on the violent days was still tight, and the League of Nations did not have a particularly optimistic message. Various countries all held a wait-and-see attitude, and it seemed that there was no way to sanction Japan's barbarism. Therefore, market sentiment was more fearful than before. In addition, it is now the end of the month, and the delivery is coming soon. With the buying sentiment currently so depressed, old bulls have to prepare to receive the goods. As a result, the need for cash is very strong. The financial situation has become increasingly tense in recent days, and the high cost of the li split is rare. All of this is enough to affect the strength of investors, so the securities market will still be difficult to see a turnaround for the time being. It is heard that the securities exchange brokers are currently gathering to discuss how to encourage buying sentiment.

<h3>Securities Unified Tax Plummets in October, Halt Trading</h3>
<h3>Other Securities Also Drop by 1 to 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Weak, Selling Transactions Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's various bond market conditions saw most spot bonds open lower. The entire day only recorded 18,500 yuan. The futures market saw greater price fluctuations, and the number of transactions was more active than before. Buying and selling ins and outs were quite lively. Next month's futures transactions also increased. It is estimated that the number of transactions in the morning was 8.7 million, and in the afternoon, it was more than 5.4 million, for a total of more than 14.1 million. Among them, unified taxes accounted for 3.8 million, while salt tax, 20 customs rolls, etc., each accounted for between 1.8 million and 900,000. Although it was weaker than the previous day when it opened in the early morning, the trend was still stable, and the ups and downs were minor. Market sentiment was very weak, and buying interest was dispersed, while selling orders tended to sell, which caused a large disparity between supply and demand. All prices fell quite sharply and weakened step by step. The downward trend did not weaken slightly in the afternoon market. The unified tax in October fell to the limit price and halt trading. Although some varieties rose slightly when closing the market, they still fell sharply across the board compared to the previous day. In addition to the unified tax falling 4 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, the next month's futures, salt tax October, 20 customs rolls 19, etc., also fell by more than 3 yuan, and others fell by less than 2 yuan. Although there has been progress in the current situation, the news from the League of Nations is not good. Various countries are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and there seems to be no way to sanction Japan's barbarity. Therefore, market sentiment has become more panicked than before. In addition, it is now the end of the month, and the delivery is coming soon. At present, with the buying interest being so depressed, the old bulls must prepare to take delivery. As a result, the need for cash is very strong. The financial situation has become increasingly tense in recent days. The high price of the li split is rare in recent years. All of this is enough to affect the strength of investors, so the securities market is still difficult to see a turnaround for the time being. It is heard that securities exchange brokers are currently gathering to discuss how to encourage buying sentiment.

<h3>Silver Split Reaches Five Qian</h3>
<p>Market Overview  The emergency situation in the financial world is becoming increasingly urgent. The situation in the market yesterday was particularly critical. The silver split actually reached five qian. Market sentiment was very panicked. Even with the ability to support the sky, it is difficult to remedy the actual situation. As far as the eye can see, there is no hope for a turnaround within this month. However, it is necessary to forcefully suppress it, or the silver split may return to a low level, and market sentiment can be calmed. If relief is not sought immediately, the silver split will remain high for a long time, not only will there be no possibility of making loans, but the foundation itself may be worrying.</p>
<p>Li Split Price  The price of one foreign li and one early market li has slightly recovered due to the extremely tight silver reserves. The closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 7 li and a half, which was a small 2 hao and a half less than the noon market the previous day. The afternoon market fell more sharply, at 7 qian 2 fen 6 li 6 hao and 2 hu and a half, a sudden drop of 1 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half from the early market. The two markets were a small 1 li more, mainly because the silver reserves were tight and were suppressed to be small. The "silver split" was five qian in both the early and noon markets, which was eight fen higher than the previous early market and was a new record not seen in this year. Banks posted two qian, and drawing heads with water also had more than four qian. Looking at the silver reserves as being so tight, it is not easy for the gold market to adjust.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market  Recently, due to the extremely tight silver reserves, subsidiary coin transactions have become sluggish. The Jiangnan and Xiaoyang markets were both 6 qian 5 fen 8 li, with only 3,000 jiao of transactions made in the early market. The Guangdong and Xiaoyang markets were also both 6 qian 5 fen 4 li and a half, and the result was also a small 5 or 6 hao compared to the previous day. The early market had 95,000 jiao of transactions, and there were no transactions in the noon market. Copper coins changed to rise by 1,000 wen, to 378,500 wen, and there were still more than 32,000 strings of transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Ocean In and Out  "Silver Funds"  Due to the tight silver reserves, the news of collection and settlement became bleak. Chinese merchants collected and settled more than 2.7 million in draft funds, foreign merchants collected and settled more than 2.4 million in draft funds, various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous funds collected and settled more than 7 million, special funds collected and settled more than 1 million, telegraphic transfer funds 5 to 600,000, warehousing 1 million, Qianzhuang and Yin Gong collected and settled more than 49.4 million, drawing head funds collected and settled more than 3.5 million, and exchange funds from various roads collected and settled more than 800,000, with over 1 million settled in cash. "Ocean Funds"  The early market made more than 1.12 million in exchange and draft funds, and 40,000 in banknotes. The noon market made more than 1.25 million in exchange and draft funds, and 35,000 in banknotes. In addition, the off-market banknotes were 75,000 in the early market and 85,000 in the noon market. Banks traded 520,000 in the early market and 600,000 in the noon market. The foreign household transactions of various banks collected and settled more than 1.4 million, with more than 2.9 million in banknotes going in and out. Qianzhuang and Yang Gong collected and settled more than 4.8 million, Yang Huatou funds collected and settled more than 1.7 million, more than 1.3 million in interbank borrowing and lending of foreign funds going in and out, more than 500,000 in small Qianzhuang transactions, and more than 300,000 in passenger route sources.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Posts Three Consecutive Contractions</h3>
<p>Estimating Two Contractions···Domestic Market Also Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian and silver markets all saw declines again, and the exchange rate continued to rise. Thus, the British gold in Shanghai became even tighter. However, the US dollar was not very strong. HSBC posted three consecutive contractions, estimating two contractions, (British gold contracted a total of half a penny, and US dollars contracted 75). It did not change from the initial posting in the morning. However, the US dollar lengthened by 125 due to squeezing the exchange rate, to 31.875 yuan. The other exchanges changed slightly.

Among the other exchanges, only Hong Kong never moved, remaining at 78 taels, and the rest all became more expensive. The domestic market loosened and then tightened, and was particularly strong in the afternoon. The British gold result was 375 contractions compared to the previous noon, and the US dollar contracted only 1875. However, the gold market had many twists and turns, with both the front and rear markets seeing 10 tael rebounds.

If relief is not sought immediately, the silver split will remain high for a long time, not only will there be no possibility of making loans, but the foundation itself may be worrying.</p>
<p>Li Split Price  The price of one foreign li and one early market li has slightly recovered due to the extremely tight silver reserves.</p>
<h3>Humble and Inglorious Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with no distinction between honor and disgrace, and the situation is relatively stable. Some believe that the price is too high and may fall. However, Japanese goods cannot pass through, and spot goods are extremely tight, making it difficult to see a decline. Moreover, the selling price of spot yarn is relatively high. However, due to the current tight monetary situation, there are still sellers, it is said.</p>
<p>○　○ Shanghai Yarn Exchange Market Flat. The opening of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange Market was flat and weak. Due to the large silver discount, each month fell by three to four cents. In the second and third rounds, it rose again, resulting in a near-flat closing. The distant months fell by 1.2 cents. In the afternoon, the market was extremely weak, with each month fluctuating by 1.2 cents. The total transaction volume was 17,600 bales. It was found that Geng Feng sold 2,750 bales, Tai Xing 1,350 bales, Chang Feng 850 bales, and Xie Sheng 600 bales.

<h3>Calm Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet, but the situation for American cotton is still firm, and there are still many who are bullish and long. However, the price of domestic cotton is higher than that of foreign cotton, and various factories lack interest in trying domestic cotton, because its market price is too high. Moreover, Shenxin Factory has absorbed a large amount of Indian cotton, amounting to 60,000 pieces, completely encroaching on Huamian's transactions. As for the number of new flowers from various routes, it is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Han Standard No Major Fluctuations. The opening of the Han Standard market was due to the rise of American cotton, but market sentiment was still weak. With gold prices being flat, each month rose slightly by one cent. In the second and third rounds, it fell slightly. In the afternoon, it fell again by five cents to one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,180 dan. It was found that Da Chang sold 6,900 dan, Gong Tai 1,200 dan, Geng Feng 4,100 dan, Yuan Da 2,700 dan, Yong Chang 2,000 dan, Xin Cheng 3,000 dan, Yi Chang 2,900 dan, and Tong Yu 1,900 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to speculative selling, but later became firm due to buying by fellow merchants and smooth spot market conditions. Futures rose by 16 to 18 points. Spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 to 11 points, spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to rising exchange rates, speculative selling, and profit-taking by bulls. Pingle fell by 3.25 rupees, Omra fell by 3 rupees, and Bairoki fell by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (21st telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market in Hexia Suddenly Relaxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 30 to 40 boats of goods arrived from the west road of Nantou. The Double Ninth Festival in this street has passed, and the sales have not been good. Prices for new japonica rice, white rice, kiln varieties, etc., have decreased by 220 to 30 cents. Baige wild rice follows closely. Customer gangs are not moving, and with this situation, it is difficult to rise. Although the inventory of new and old Lu Yangjian is small, the situation is downstream. Old broken husks and Bai Yuan are being sold, with a narrowed margin of about 20 cents.</p>
<p>Xinzha. The rice situation along Suzhou Creek did not improve yesterday. The number of people arriving at the market in the morning was extremely lacking. The market for all goods tightened and then softened again. The arrival of goods from the west road is still surging, and people's hearts are tired. Xixin kiln and Bodu Jian are falling by 10 to 20 cents. Early rice and Baige have no spirit. The arrival of new customer Jian Zhuang is limited, and the route for customer gangs is slightly open. The situation is weak.</p>
<h3>New Saigon Futures Traded</h3>
<p>Nanjing Kexian Rice Slightly Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign rice market, spot goods were in a state of silence due to the large number of arrivals and the hesitant inaction of importers. The appetite in this street was also weak. Yesterday, the total market only imported 600 bags of Annam rice, priced at 12 yuan 17 cents to 12 yuan. Only a small amount of Nanjing Kexian rice arrived by train, and there were no other arrivals in storage. 200 bags of Nanjing white rice were sold, priced at 9 yuan 90 cents, and 150 bags of Jiangxi Jiyuan rice were sold, priced at 13 yuan 20 cents. Futures for foreign rice had not opened for many days, and the market was very dull. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. finally sold 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 for April delivery, with delivery by Yinghua Co., priced at 5 taels 70 cents, which was purchased by a firm in this street, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market High in the Morning, Flat in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month also showed a surge, due to the improved quotation of foreign wheat. In the foreign wheat market, there were also suspicious rumors, as if the fundamentals had already been shaken, and people's hearts could not help but be shocked. Therefore, the highest price for this month rose to 2 taels and 01 and a half cents, November to 2 taels and 03 and a half cents, December to 2 taels and 05 cents, January to 2 taels and 07 and a half cents, February to 2 taels and 08 and a half cents, and March to 2 taels and 09 and a half cents, which was 20 to 30 cents higher than the closing price of the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable, but then the situation turned to harmony due to the return of longs and some factory sell-offs, falling by more than 10 cents compared to the morning. As a result, this month was 5 cents better than the previous day, November was 7 and a half cents better, December was 1 and a half cents better, January was 1 and a half cents better, February was 1 and 7 and a half cents better, and March was 1 and a half cents better, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Trend Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a trend of being stable in the near term and rising in the long term. This month, due to the imminent delivery, the bulls inside and outside the industry had to close their positions, so there were few fluctuations in each round of trading. However, for the distant months, because foreign wheat was rising step by step, the general assumption was that the arrival of foreign wheat in China and the number of orders would not be as surging and unlimited as a few months ago. Because of this reason, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry naturally became excited, so the opening price also rose step by step. As a result, this month was 1 cent better than the previous day, November was 6 cents better, December was 7 cents better, January was 6 cents better, February was 4 cents better, and March was 7 cents better, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: The Silk Market Is Still Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port was still difficult to advance. Although New York white filature had an appetite, the price of silk in the telegram was still trending flat and weak. The price of B-grade, 83% evenness, was still only 845 taels, and the factory had to lose more than 100 taels. Negotiations were still difficult to conclude. Spot sales in Lyon were still stagnant. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson imported 20 bales of Shanghai white filature, Dachang and others imported 25 bales of Sichuan yellow filature, and Gong'an imported 10 bales of white filature, and the price remained stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Transactions Still Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in this port still had no major progress. British firms such as Jardine Matheson and Jinlong, etc., were all holding a wait-and-see attitude because they had sent out a large number of Zhenmei telegrams and had not yet seen a reply. The whole city only bought 198 boxes of Qimen black tea and Zhenmei, Xiami, and Gongxi green tea from Dodeyuan, Shengsheng, and Fulin, etc. The market price was still extremely low, it is said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Fell and Rose Again</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli is recently active in the market, and the market price has fallen and risen again. The initial price opened at 23 taels and 60 cents, and then rose to 23 taels and 80 cents to 24 taels. The market was even tighter yesterday, and customer goods opened another hundred bags, priced at 24 taels and a half, which was an increase of 9 taels before and after. Therefore, the market price increased accordingly, and there was no large amount of source goods that could arrive temporarily, so it is temporarily difficult to expect relaxation, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware: English White Iron Plates Arrive, Selling Well and Smoothly</h3>
<p>Since the import of thin English white iron plates from the East has stopped, the trend in this port has been unusually exciting. Therefore, in the past few days, as many as 600 to 700 boxes have been opened. However, the remaining spot goods have been searched clean, and the futures that are subsequently loaded have also been mostly sold. The price of Red Crow brand is 1 tael and 50 cents per sheet, Comet brand is 1 tael and 47 cents, and miscellaneous brands are 1 tael and 45 cents (all above are 3 feet 7 inches). The 3 feet 6 inches foreign letter brand is sold for 1 tael and 30 cents, the Triangle brand is 1 tael and 25 cents, and the miscellaneous brand is 1 tael, 20 cents and 3 cents. It was found that the Yangtze River Road is the most prosperous among the various gangs, and the business on North Henan Road is relatively less. Recently, many from Fujian and Shantou have also inquired. Although the number of orders is not large, if the exchange rate can be calculated, the transaction aspect will be prosperous, I fear.</p>

<h3>Noteworthy Japanese Birth Rate</h3>
<p>Four Children Born Every Minute</p>
<p>Asian countries today have a major problem to solve. This problem is how to solve the difficult subject of overpopulation. Great Britain, Germany, France, and the United States of America in Europe are the complete opposite, with birth rates gradually decreasing, far less than in Asia. Among the Asian countries, the increase in the Japanese population is particularly noteworthy. In recent years, the Japanese birth rate has been rising day by day, while the mortality rate is gradually decreasing. Moreover, there are many marriages and few divorces in Japan, resulting in many children. According to current statistics, four children are born every minute in Japan. Therefore, it is generally expected that in another thirty years, its national population will certainly reach 100,000,000.</p>
<p>Calculating at four children born every minute, the population will increase by 43,000 per month. According to the announcement by the Statistics Bureau of the Japanese Cabinet, on October 1, 1930, the total population of Japan, excluding overseas conquered territories, was 64,450,005, an increase of 4,713,183 compared to 1925, with a percentage increase of 7.9%. The increase from 1925 compared to the statistics five years earlier was 3,773,769, with a percentage increase of 6.7%.</p>
<p>Comparing Japan with European countries and the Americas, the situation is very different. In the last 50 years, the birth rates in Great Britain, Germany, and the United States have gradually declined, while Japan has been rising step by step. Its current population is the same as the population of England in 1870. The annual population increase rate in Japan, according to the 1930 census, is 15.30 per thousand people, while it was 13.14 ten years ago. Therefore, in thirty years, by 1960, the population of Japan could reach 100,000,000. Its population would be the same as the population of the United States in 1920. Thirty years later, the Japanese population will reach 100 million, at which time its position in terms of manpower will be third, with the United States first and Soviet Russia second. Although the future is a world of science and machinery, the words "manpower" seem to have little relevance. However, for a country like Japan, where the people are willing to endure hardship and the government is working hard, with 100 million people united in one mind, its power cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese government superficially encourages childbirth, many politicians secretly oppose birth control. The government takes action against merchants selling birth control devices or drugs, only allowing people with illnesses to use such things. So what methods will they ultimately use to solve this difficult problem? On the surface, they naturally say to develop domestic industries and promote overseas trade to solve the problems of overpopulation and people's livelihoods. But in reality, the Japanese archipelago cannot possibly accommodate the surging population growth. Thus, the only method is emigration. The first step is to emigrate to its conquered territories, such as Taiwan and Korea. The second step is to use violence to invade China and move Japanese people to the three northeastern provinces. The third step is simply to move Japanese people entirely to China. If we think about it with our eyes closed, in thirty years, the Japanese population will be 100 million, which is one-quarter of the current Chinese population. But does China actually have 400 million people? No, it definitely does not reach this number. In our country, natural disasters and man-made calamities have occurred throughout the years, making people unable to live. Not only is the population growth declining day by day, but even in terms of the existing number, the mortality rate is greater than in any other country on Earth, and it has long been less than 400 million. Therefore, can the increase in births and the rapid increase in population in Japan not make the Chinese people feel chilled?</p>
<p>The city with the largest population in Japan is Osaka, with a population of 2,453,573 people. Tokyo is second, with 2,070,913 people. These two major cities, because of the rapid increase in population, are developing incessantly towards the surrounding countryside. Tokyo, including the suburbs, has a thriving metropolitan population comparable to that of London, England, and New York, USA. There are no fewer than twenty-one cities in the suburbs of Tokyo, each with a population of 50,000 people, included in the Tokyo area. Therefore, the total population within the area is 5,408,687 people. The total population of the Osaka area is 3,540,017 people. 24% of Japan's total population resides in 109 cities, of which 28 cities have a population exceeding 1,000,000 people. In the past five years, eight new cities have been added, each with a population of 30,000 people. The six major cities with more than 500,000 residents, in addition to Osaka and Tokyo, are Nagoya, with 907,404 people, Kobe, with 787,616 people, Kyoto, with 765,142 people, and Yokohama, with 620,306 people. In addition, there are twenty-two cities, each with more than 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>Of the total population of Japan, 50% to 55% of the people reside in cities with a population of less than 10,000 people. In Japan, there are approximately 27,000,000 farmers, approximately 5,000,000 workers, and approximately 8,000,000 merchants. The countryside is not as rich as neighboring cities.</p>

<h3>Voices from the Flood-Stricken Areas</h3>
<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>A Self-Account by a Youth Suffering from Disaster</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, I am extremely ashamed to use such an address, given my unfortunate circumstances. But I am one who has encountered such an unfortunate environment, and in recounting my tragic suffering, perhaps the gentlemen will take pity on me. I am from Shaanxi, living in a rural village near a lake. My family owns ten mu of embanked fields, and I have both parents, an elder sister, a younger sister, and two younger brothers. Apart from me, who has received a higher primary school education, they are all illiterate. They work barefoot under the intense sunlight every day, cultivating the fields themselves. Because if we don't farm ourselves, we won't have the ability to eat and will starve to death. In normal times, our finances are already very tight. But the price of their blood and sweat, apart from providing food for our family of seven, can barely allow me to study at the higher primary school. In my situation as a poor man, it is inherently impossible to sustain my studies. But since my body is small and thin and I have no strength, I can't farm. Therefore, I have no choice but to "live one day at a time and study." In my mind, I believe that if I can receive a primary school education, I will at least be more convenient than those who don't study. I will be able to read the simplest letters and write the simplest letters. That is my only hope. At the same time, within this hope, I harbor the ambition to be self-reliant in the future. But now, this beautiful dream has been shattered. I definitely have no opportunity or hope to continue studying, and definitely no ambition to be self-reliant. That's because a torrential rain lasting dozens of days has washed away our only property—ten mu of fields—turning them into a vast ocean. I can't even distinguish where the shadows of our fields are. So, what can we do? Beg? That won't have any results, because there are too many people begging now. There are beggars on the east side and beggars on the west side. People may doubt that I am not really begging and may think that I am hanging a "sign" of begging and wearing a "mask" of pleading. For this reason, I have decided not to beg. But how can we live? This question is pressing me tightly. So, my family and I decided to move to a place without floods. In our ideal, we also dreamed that we would find a philanthropist who would help us and give us the chance to not die temporarily. At the same time, we hoped that in our struggle with fate, we might find a position that would maintain the minimum standard of living, making our hopes brighter and making us feel some of the interest of life and the spirit of struggle. Therefore, in the climate of wind and rain, we walked one step at a time to a relatively high village more than five li away from us—a village that has not suffered much flooding. Dear compatriots, five li is such a short journey. In normal times, we could reach our destination in one hour. But in these days of hunger and cold, it's really two steps for every one step. We walked for two hours before discovering our New World—our destination. When we arrived there, we began to ask the people in that relatively fortunate village. But when they saw us in such a dilapidated state, they not only didn't give us any comfort or inquiries, they even turned their heads away from us and walked to the other side with a sneer. This was a major blow to us who were in "dire straits at dusk." This major blow made us tremble, as if we had walked into a mountain valley where wolves and tigers gathered, with a big river in front and pursuing soldiers behind us. We couldn't help but cry loudly, cursing our bleak fate. How miserable we cried! We cried for an hour, but still didn't see the shadow of anyone. Humans are truly cruel animals. They only know how to take care of their own happiness. They only care about eating comfortably, living comfortably, and using things comfortably. How can they care about their compatriots? How can they know that besides their own parents, wives, and children, there are other human beings? How can they know the greatness of giving sympathy? How can they know the true painful life of the people in the flood-stricken areas, a life that cannot be endured? How can they know that people as unfortunate as us have drifted to their village? How can they hear our cries of blood and tears? We were thinking that we had come to the gates of hell. Having suffered so much contempt and so much hunger, it would be better to die cleanly than to stand here crying like this. We wouldn't have to run this five li journey step by step. Why would we pour out our passionate cries in such a village? Why would I bring my parents, sisters, and brothers to suffer? If they died at home, waiting for the water to overwhelm them, wouldn't that be five li less of walking? Wouldn't that reduce the contempt of people? I was thinking, hating, and repenting, when suddenly, unexpectedly, an old man near sixty years old stood in front of us. He comforted us and asked us the reason for our crying. When he saw that our throats were hoarse from crying, he gave us a few cups of tea and a few bowls of rice. He tried his best to satisfy our hunger. After we finished eating the rice and tea, he invited us to live in his home. Needless to say, we were of course extremely grateful. He introduced his wife and son to us, and they all talked to us very happily. We told them in detail about our suffering, and they shed tears of sympathy, pity, and comfort. We lived quietly in the old man's house, and life was of course relatively quiet. But thinking about the suffering of those who continue to suffer from the flood, I can't help but shed tears. We have been living in that old man's house for more than half a month. More than half a month is of course not a long period, but when I think about everything in the quiet night, thinking about their great burden for us, wouldn't that add an economic "cross" to their simple family? Wouldn't that make them unable to express their suffering? Wouldn't that create a phenomenon where we feel uneasy while eating? Wouldn't that make us think that we have no ability to repay them? Wouldn't that be a major annoyance in our hearts? How can we live in peace? How can we live in peace with such a heart? Dear compatriots, how can we live in peace? But I have now decided. I have decided to have my parents, sisters, and brothers taken care of by them, having them do some work for the old man's family. I have decided not to live there any longer. I want to carve out a path from my bad environment, be proactive, advance, and struggle. Then I will be worthy of being called an educated youth. Then I will be a part of the responsibility of undertaking the future of our nation. Then I will walk on the path of light. Dear compatriots, I, who have just experienced the suffering of the flood, and at the same time lack the cultivation of knowledge and the experience of society, am very much in need of your timely guidance. Dear compatriots,</p>
