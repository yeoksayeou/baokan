<p>科學衛生上具有偉大貢獻亦可謂之做大事今後中國國民應做的大事就是要實行縣自治以確立憲政基礎官可做可不做大官可做小官亦可做不必拘於階級與名位中山爲總理故鄉經規劃爲模範縣唐少川先生以黨國勳耆任爲縣長即是要做大事不要做大官之表示可惜現在廣東事件發生又似乎有一點晚節不堅之象甚願大家共凛總理意旨趨向於做大事之一途以盡國民責任</p>

<p>慨自黄河北徒淮河故道淤塞迄今七十餘年矣其間提議導淮者非一人籌備導淮乾非一日雖未能達施工之目的而其導淮方針皆以放流入海降低洪水位爲原則今茲中央政府於導淮事宜積極進行並組織委員會使清穆亦忝預其列清穆生長海濱於江淮利病攸關夙所見聞略知梗槪用敢撮要陳之淮河自河南之桐柏東下七百里至豫皖交界之三河尖兩岸山岡隄防向稱完固河底傾斜又急縱有積水易洩瀉固無沉災可言三河尖至蚌埠四百里其間若　若潤若渦若芡若淝若潁皆　流入淮之水也計其河之長與量之巨視淮河本身且數倍之而其他匯人之支流尙不計其數匯水多則傾斜緩伏秋大汎災無倖免蚌埠至老子山蘇皖交界之地也計程三百餘里除支流外在五河境内又有濉澮潼沱池諸巨川左右加入盰眙而下接近洪湖潦則水陸不分旱則沙洲林立紊亂複雜斯爲極矣自老子山沿洪湖大隄一百四十餘里至楊莊又東北三百餘里經淮陰淮安漣水阜寗以至海口爲昔日之淮河故道自宋即爲黄奪今乃高仰鮮通此全淮情形也統計淮河共長約二千一百里以河道言爲三省公有以災害言爲蘇皖共有夫治水之道必先知上游來水之成分各區受災之實况下游洩水之能力并於中游瀦水區域預定適宜之標洪水位乃能定施工緩急與用欵多寡之槪算今查淮河水量以最近二十年爲例則民五民十皆爲大水之年而民十之水又大於民五計其實測流量每秒一萬四千餘立方公尺洪湖水位高出海平面十五公尺此害水也假如下游各河具有同等洩量之能力水位不致横溢民田固無所謂災亦不必言導但昔日之淮江海分流也今則祇有入江之路矣民十之充分流量每秒八千餘立方公尺約占全淮來水五分之三其所以演成江皖北數十縣之地面積水深則盈丈淺亦五六七尺之沉淪慘劇兩省人民視爲毒蛇猛獸一日不可進留者即此入江以外汜濫無歸尙占全淮五分之二之來水也假曰以此水儲諸江皖間乎則洪湖水位巳有十五公尺之高度以吾國禦水工程中號稱最鉅大最堅固之洪湖東隄且有岌岌不可終日之勢何堪再事加增假日以此水儲諸高寳湖乎則十年水位亦高出海平面八尺以上已與保障下河六七縣之運河東岸相齊設有疏虞則高寳興東泰鹽阜人民在運河以東者悉抱其魚之痛矣故導淮問題降低洪水位問題也亦歸納此五分之二之來水問題也古今中外焉有水位降低而仍演水災者乎</p>
<p>清穆固知昔日之籌議導淮者其宗旨皆爲未災也今之宗旨仍無異於昔所云耶清穆敢進一言曰淮之爲災非爲其不能人江乃爲其不能入海耳就令最近二十年中之淮水以五年爲最大而入江之路能爲同等之宣洩也清穆尙不敢以爲有恃無恐蓋以淮河與長江距離旣近方位氣候完全相同故江淮並漲爲不可避免之事實即以十年九月之水位間有高於五年八月者而十年之入江洩量反小於五年即由於十年江水高於五年之故清穆之愚姑勿論淮水入江江水增高江南北各縣海塘圩田與内地洩水均直接受頂托或倒灌之影響也亦勿論江水增高縱不盈尺時間不過三日而在此盈隄拍岸之時即此不盈尺之高漲不三日之沉浸已足以釀成巨災而有餘也即爲治准安全計亦應以江水漸高有另闢去路之必要况十年淮水更有大於五年五分之二之實騐乎以今日之入江水道即不施以任何工程而九千立方公尺之洩量已爲其每秒固有之能力今復以全力注重入江而洩量無有加增忍使江皖兩省全由此剩餘之水每秒五千餘立方公尺洪澤湖水位高出海平面十五公尺迭次造成空前大災者而不先爲之籌畫出路反定洪湖之標準洪水位在十六公尺尺以上則何所用其導更何解於爲去災而導淮</p>
<p>抑清穆更有進者事無大小各有其賓主之定位淮之安危江皖之安危也證諸已往之事實無論主人江者未合於淮災情形即江海兼籌恐亦力有未逮往昔之籌備導淮者其初亦主江海分流也及受五年十年之大水經騐施工程序遂賓江而主海豈有他哉利害權衡害旣甚即當以去去害爲主淮之害成於水水位高而民田没有以降低之則害去而利即生其所定之洪湖標準洪水位在十四公尺以下尋常之灌漑交通亦已各得其用而主要工程之設計三壩五港束隄歸海取法靳文襄之遺意用欵不足五千萬元皖省之工費亦相似卒以鉅欵難籌未能實現耳今茲工費得諸庚欵者不過三千萬元尙未能支撥現欵且以蘇皖關係是否能全數撥歸蘇用至工務處所擬之收入項下如黄河灘地雖近一百萬畝但經多年台營官地等局之放領所存料亦無多民九清理已苦無從着手湖灘狀况大致相同即使中央與地方雙方担負工欵人海工程之能否敷用正未可知若復分爲二勢必愈形短絀此就經費言之也如言利害則歸江效果前已述之果能先從人海施工則多洩一分入海之水即减少一分地面之災至於路綫之選擇臨洪灌河舊黄河往日皆有一度之審議也惟高郵以下之車邏新壩南關三壩如民十洩水每秒亦五千八百立方公尺但因壩水下注散溢民田故啟壩之期必在秋後此此游沉災已無可輕减矣如能以工務處之高寳湖築隄計畫施之三壩以下或更及寳應之涇河則夾隄成渠固可直趨串塲河并分輪東川鬥龍新洋射陽等港以歸海上游漲水各壩及時開放即使江淮並漲或因沿江特殊原因而縮减洩量則有歸海爲之救濟清穆深望竭全力以助其成從此江海分流盈虚調劑乃更從事於漑灌交通之設計在在得以操縱節制庶水位得其平淮災得其洽去害生利江皖永賴矣率貢芻蕘伏祈垂　謹陳委員長蔣副委員長莊委員王清穆</p>

<p>免費發報供不應求　該電臺爲中德正式通電紀念並廣事宣傳起見特備有四百張免費報券由中外商人自由領取免費發電一日該券截至昨日上午十一時早已告罄後至者尙陸續不絶茲將該券式樣照錄如下該券爲白底藍字中英文並列上首印有交通部國際無線電臺免費發報券字樣下分爲（一）憑券發報槪不收費（二）字數限止二十五字（三）發往地點德國各處（四）限於二十年六月一日有效（五）收報處所仁記路沙遜大厦内</p>
<p>電報種類字數價格　凡由中國拍往德國各處之電報分爲三種其一爲快電每字價格三元四角半約二十分鐘可到目的地其二係慢電每字一元一角三分約一時可到其三爲日訊電每字一元一角五分但限定至少須二十五字始能拍發定四十八小時到達目的地</p>
<p>中法通電不再免費　中國與法國間早巳正式通電成績亦甚佳但並未有免費之開放該台爲推廣營業宣傳起見意將正式補行免費一日曾將以上各情　電向法國電台徵求意見（按免費章程須雙方同意否則我方不收費彼方仍須收費）嗣據法方面電稱該電台於去歲十二月中法試電時巳經免費一日因此中法通電將不再有免費之舉矣</p>
<p>中日通報未接部令　據該電台職員語遠東社記者謂中日非正式通電業巳開始本擬今日（即昨日）與中德同時舉行正式通電　嗣以交通部尙未有中日正式通報之命令故日内暫不能實現須俟部令到達後方能定期云</p>

<h3 id="e1">Promulgation of the Provisional Constitution by the National Government <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a grand memorial week, a memorial service for the enshrinement [of Sun Yat-sen], and a ceremony marking the completion of the Provisional Constitution were held successively at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Chiang Kai-shek recited the Provisional Constitution, and all circles in the capital celebrated enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Nanjing, June 1st, was the date for the memorial service for the enshrinement [of Sun Yat-sen] and the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China. Since the day fell on a Monday, three ceremonies—a grand memorial week, a memorial service for the enshrinement [of Sun Yat-sen], and a ceremony marking the completion of the Provisional Constitution—were held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum starting at 7:30 AM. Present were members of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee, the Chairman and members of the National Government, including Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Peide, Wang Zhengting, Wu Jingheng, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, Ding Weifen, Liu Luyin, Jiao Yitang, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Fang Juehui, Zeng Yangfu, Enke Batu, Khingan, Chen Zhaoying, Zhou Qigang, and Yu Jingtang, as well as heads of various departments and commissions.</p>
<h3 id="e2">A panoramic view of the celebration of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution by all sectors of the capital <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Senior officials and important figures from the military and political circles, such as Ma Fuxiang, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaogzu, Gu Zhenglun, and Yang Jie, as well as approximately two thousand personnel from various government agencies at the junior and senior levels, also attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's account of the memorial service and proceedings is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Grand Memorial Week <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, Wu Jingheng delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of holding a memorial week was to instill the teachings of Sun Yat-sen every week, so that all comrades would not forget them and would avoid making mistakes in their work. After Sun Yat-sen's death, his body was temporarily placed in the Western Hills of Beiping. At that time, the country was in turmoil, and his remains could not be properly enshrined at an earlier date. Now that the national affairs have been stabilized, his remains were enshrined in Nanjing according to his wishes. The responsibility of the Party is not only to enshrine Sun Yat-sen's remains, but also to uphold the spirit of Sun Yat-sen while he was still alive. The recent convening of the National Assembly and the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution can slightly put Sun Yat-sen's mind at ease, but this is only the starting point for building a great national cause. We must achieve the goals of freedom and equality. After the completion of political tutelage and construction, we must convene a National Congress to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of China and promulgate it to the world. At that time, Sun Yat-sen's mind can be greatly put at ease. The important foundation for preparing for constitutional government and construction should start with the work of "taking the county as the unit of self-governance." From the county level, it should be extended to the provinces. When local autonomy in all provinces is complete, constitutional government will begin. The Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage is a kind of contract between the people and the government. It must be implemented step by step and gradually move towards the track of the Constitution. I recall that Sun Yat-sen said in a speech at Lingnan University, "People should not seek high office, but should do great things." If one's goal is to climb the ladder of officialdom, and one is constantly thinking about it, it is quite vulgar and inevitably too bitter. Doing great things is not limited to the political arena, such as Pasteur of France, who invented microorganisms</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>made great contributions to science and hygiene and can also be said to have done great things. In the future, the great thing that Chinese citizens should do is to implement county self-governance to establish a constitutional foundation. Officials can be made or not, high officials can be made or small officials can be made. There is no need to be bound by class and position. Zhongshan, being Sun Yat-sen's hometown, has been planned as a model county. Mr. Tang Shaochuan, who is a veteran of the Party and the country, was appointed as the county magistrate, which is an expression of doing great things rather than seeking high office. It is a pity that the Guangdong incident has occurred now, and it seems that there is a bit of late-life instability. I sincerely hope that everyone will jointly adhere to Sun Yat-sen's will and strive to do great things to fulfill their national responsibilities.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Ceremony for the Completion of the Provisional Constitution <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The National Government transcribed the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China in regular script, affixed the national seal, and decorated it with a glass mirror frame and a silk Party and national emblem. It was placed in the memorial hall of the mausoleum in front of Sun Yat-sen's statue. After everyone paid their respects, Chiang Kai-shek respectfully read each article. The music was played, and the ceremony was completed.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Promulgation of the Provisional Constitution <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM on the 1st, the National Government officially promulgated the Provisional Constitution at the public sports field on Banbian Street. At the same time, all sectors of the capital held a celebration meeting for the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution. Present were Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, He Yaogzu, Zhang Qun, Wu Jingheng, Fang Juehui, Wang Zhengting, Zhuang Songfu, Song Meiling, and other representatives from various agencies and groups, as well as approximately 100,000 people from the general public. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek conducted the ceremony, he read the entire Provisional Constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Celebration Meeting <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>After the Provisional Constitution was promulgated, the celebration meeting began. The presidium consisted of nine people: Wang Zhengting from the Central Party Headquarters, Zhu Wenzhong from the National Government, Shi Weihuan from the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters, Huang Zengyue from the Beijing Municipal Government, Chen Bingzhi from the industrial sector, Jiang Miansun from the academic sector, and representatives from the agricultural and commercial sectors. After Chairman Wang Zhengting conducted the ceremony, he delivered an opening speech, saying that today, all the people of Nanjing are holding a celebration meeting to celebrate the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution. We must work diligently and earnestly during the period of political tutelage. Sun Yat-sen divided China's construction very clearly into the periods of military government, political tutelage, and constitutional government. The Provisional Constitution is the fundamental law of the period of political tutelage. Its content stipulates in detail the rights and obligations, livelihood, and education of the people. The central and local governments adopt a system of balanced powers, and the central and local duties are also clearly divided. However, to celebrate the Provisional Constitution, everyone must abide by it. The government and the people both have the obligation to abide by it. Its purpose is to reach the constitutional government period as soon as possible from the political tutelage period. After the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, we should pay attention to two points: (1) All people must cooperate. Sun Yat-sen's will said to awaken the people. Its purpose is to make all the people invigorate their spirits, cooperate with one heart, and seek China's construction and realize the abolition of unequal treaties. However, there are still some people who cannot cooperate, and Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven cannot be at peace. We must know that whoever obeys Party discipline and implements Sun Yat-sen's principles is Sun Yat-sen's loyal believer, and whoever violates Sun Yat-sen's principles and cannot cooperate with the central government is a traitor to the country. (2) All people must cooperate and must be consistent from beginning to end. Sun Yat-sen's principles must be earnestly followed by all people from beginning to end, united to create a great and glorious Republic of China. I hope that everyone will work hard to achieve this goal. Dai Chuanxian, a representative of the Central Government, delivered a speech, saying that fellow comrades, fellow compatriots, today is the date of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. Today, all the people across the country are holding enthusiastic celebrations for the completion of the Provisional Constitution and are enthusiastically expressing their acceptance of the Provisional Constitution. From today onwards, the government and the people are united in one heart and one mind, and under the guidance of the Provisional Constitution, we will work hard to do unification work and construction work. Everyone knows that China's construction is how to build it. The method of construction is the Provisional Constitution. The Provisional Constitution is the largest blueprint that indicates construction. With the Provisional Constitution, everyone has a scale to follow. In the future, the government and the people can use this scale to unite, believe, cooperate, work together, and implement it together. Completing the construction of political tutelage is to build a foundation for constitutional government and to create a scale for constitutional government. Achieving the goal of constitutional government relies on first having the Provisional Constitution. The spirit of the Provisional Constitution is to achieve the abolition of unequal treaties and the completion of China's independence. I hope that all comrades and compatriots across the country will sincerely accept it and work hard to implement it. The Provisional Constitution is what Sun Yat-sen showed us. Accepting the Provisional Constitution is accepting Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Implementing the Provisional Constitution is implementing Sun Yat-sen's teachings. To complete construction, we must accept the Provisional Constitution, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, Yu Youren, a member of the National Government, delivered a speech, saying that everyone has already heard the Chairman of the National Government recite the Provisional Constitution. Today, we announced the Provisional Constitution to Sun Yat-sen's spirit first, and then read it to the public. On the one hand, we can satisfy the hopes of the people across the country for many years, and on the other hand, we can also comfort Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven. We often recite Sun Yat-sen's will, which says, "The convening of the National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties must be promoted to be realized within the shortest possible time." However, this shortest period has been extended to several years because the domestic disturbances have been endless. It was not until this year that the National Assembly could be convened and the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage could be formulated. The government colleagues are very ashamed of the postponement of the National Assembly. Now that the meeting has been held and the Provisional Constitution has been formally promulgated, this law is formulated in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's principles and is the fundamental law of the country. After it is promulgated, the people of the whole country should unanimously support it. The National Government wants to make China a new era and should have new strength. All this new era and new strength can be said to be created by the Provisional Constitution. What needs to be strived for after the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution is the work of peace and unification to satisfy the hopes of the people across the country. However, it can only be realized by making every effort to promote the Provisional Constitution. Since the Provisional Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, the people of the whole country should abide by it together. If there are those who oppose it, they are opposing Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, and those who oppose Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are also against Sun Yat-sen's will and can be said to be counter-revolutionary. After the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, if we eliminate the Communist bandits and strive to build industries, the government will gradually do it so that China can reach constitutional government from political tutelage to realize Sun Yat-sen's will, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, Lai Lian, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, saying that a few days ago, all the citizens of the city held a meeting here to celebrate the National Assembly. Today, we are holding a meeting here to celebrate the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage. All the citizens of the city have expressed their warm welcome to the National Assembly and have expressed their sincere acceptance of the Provisional Constitution, and so on. Next, Huang Zengyue, a representative of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech, saying that the Provisional Constitution of Political Tutelage is promulgated today, and the government and the people will have rules to follow from now on and should abide by them together to complete permanent peace and unification, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, Wu Mulan, a representative of the women of Beijing, delivered a speech, saying that the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution today is the fundamental law obtained from twenty years of revolutionary bloodshed, and the public must support it with one heart and one mind. Supporting the Provisional Constitution is supporting peace, and so on.</p>
<p>Next, Chen Bingzhi, a representative of the industrial sector of Beijing, delivered a speech, saying that the significance of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution has been said by various representatives, and the public has already understood it. Today, I have two proposals: (1) Telegram to the people of the whole country to abide by the Provisional Constitution. (3) Telegram to the people of the whole country to support peace and unification. Please raise your hands to approve. Everyone raised their hands and applauded in approval. After Chen finished speaking, the chairman immediately announced the slogan. The whole audience cheered in unison. Then, the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the meeting dispersed after a photograph.</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Conflict between the Italian Party and the Church <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Although the cause of the sudden and significant conflict between the Italian Party and the Church this time is unknown, judging from the history of compromise between the Italian government and the Roman Curia, it was known that such a phenomenon would inevitably occur today. Since the Italian army overturned the power of the Roman Pope in 1870 and formulated the Law of Guarantees, although the Pope was dissatisfied, he was forced to accept it under the pressure of the Italian army. Mussolini, who was originally against religion, is now willing to compromise with the Pope only because the Roman Catholic Church occupies the most power in Italian society and can be used to increase the prestige of the Italian government. He does not hesitate to give various benefits to win the favor of the Pope. It can be seen that neither side has the sincerity of compromise. Moreover, in terms of doctrine, the Catholic Church holds an internationalist view, while the Fascist Party holds an aggressive nationalist view. It can be seen that there is no fundamental compromise. Even though the Italian government and the Pope have repeatedly discussed compromise, conflicts still occur from time to time. Mussolini's main goal is to transfer all youth education matters to Balilla and completely ban its old institutions, intending to make the Fascist Party exclusively occupy the power of education. The Pope knew the reason and repeatedly protested to the Italian government. This is the main reason for the conflict between the Party and the Church. In this matter, the Italian government has instructed the governors of various provinces to opportunistically ban Catholic institutions in the country, and the Pope has also instructed the heads of various churches to direct the church to implement countermeasures. The seriousness of the situation is not accidental, but has been accumulating for a long time and has now suddenly erupted.</p>
<p>Received Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<p>Jinan: Today, all sectors held a citizens' meeting at the public sports field to commemorate the enshrinement [of Sun Yat-sen] and celebrate the Provisional Constitution.

<p>Temporarily No Need to Issue</p>
<p>Nanjing: Yesterday's telegram regarding the declaration to foreign countries has been received. It is known that it is inconvenient for the formal government to often make declarations to foreign countries. If it is necessary, it can be done by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, it is not planned to issue it. As for the reasons for the declaration to the domestic [audience], the Central Government has already issued them.

<p>Nanjing: A Central Committee member talked about Guangdong affairs, saying that since the Central Government and various generals, as well as civilian and military Party committees, have repeatedly telegraphed criticisms, those who have rashly gone to Guangdong have frequently been reported to be passive. The government has received many reports from Hong Kong in recent days, and the situation is becoming more relaxed day by day. It is hoped that the Guangdong members will broaden their horizons and return together to build the country, and do not have to be confined to one corner, so that their talents cannot be displayed.

<p>The Government Issues Instructions</p>
<p>Hoping Officials and Citizens Cooperate</p>
<p>To Avert the Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Telecommunications News Agency) - The salary reduction for Japanese government officials, effective today, has been implemented. The government issued instructions in the name of the Prime Minister, stating that the revised salary decree is being implemented from today. The global economic turmoil, originating from the European War, has intensified daily, creating an unprecedented dire situation. Nations are attempting to avert this crisis, and Japan cannot be an exception. Therefore, officials and citizens should cooperate to address this most difficult situation with the best possible methods. Although the government is striving to restore finances, the plight of cities, towns, and villages is deepening, leading to a decline in national treasury revenue. Aside from reducing expenditures, there is no other option. Government officials, serving the nation, should share the joys and sorrows of the general populace and partake in the hardships of national life. Hence, the salary reduction is being implemented. The steadfast and sacrificial spirit of the Japanese people has always been admired worldwide. It is hoped that all levels will unite, take responsibility, and dedicate their utmost sincerity to navigate this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Reuters) - The Japanese government, previously concerned about affecting national education, did not reduce the salaries of elementary school teachers. However, after repeated consideration, it has been decided that elementary school teachers will also have their salaries reduced from July 1st, but only those with monthly salaries exceeding 100 yuan. It is estimated that only over 15,000 of the approximately 300,000 elementary school teachers will be affected. The salary reduction for government officials has already been implemented today.</p>

<p>The Pope Suffers Reverses and Loses His Appetite</p>
<p>Severely Criticizing the Italian Government's Various Atrocities</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (National News) - It is believed here in political circles that the conflict between the Vatican and the Fascist Party has entered a dangerous phase since the closure of Catholic clubs. It is expected that the Pope will lodge a formal diplomatic protest. Furthermore, Vatican sources claim that the Pope's health has been greatly affected by recent setbacks. Since the escalation of the dispute with the Fascist Party, he has barely eaten.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (Reuters) - Catholic organizations closed by order of the Italian government are gradually reopening, and police are gradually being withdrawn. Yesterday, during a meeting of cardinals, the Pope severely criticized the Italian government's attitude towards religion in schools, stating that the current education is purely one of hatred, unbridled and violent. The disturbances are the result of this education. The Pope condemned the Italian government's policies of bloodshed, oppression, aggression, and confiscation, and prayed that heaven would not punish the guilty.</p>
<p>Rome, 31st May (National News) - The conflict between the Italian Fascist Party and the Catholic Church has intensified as the Vatican has decided to take active measures to resist the Fascist Party's anti-Catholic actions. The Holy City's newspaper published a papal decree today stating that anti-Catholic movements are intensifying. From now on, local bishops should personally supervise and guide everything. Some say this is a manifestation of the Church's self-defense policy. The Holy City's newspaper has also listed and published all the Fascist Party's atrocities, covering over a page, and claiming that the police have not taken steps to stop them. This type of newspaper is not allowed to be sold in Rome, and those who wish to read it must go to the Holy City to purchase it.</p>

<p>Breslau, 30th (Reuters) - 120,000 members of the German Steel Helmet League gathered here today for a parade to commemorate the sea battle off Jutland during the European War. Their Commander-in-Chief, Feld, now a soda water manufacturer, addressed the crowd, stating that they would never recognize the borders set by the Treaty of Versailles and would not rest until the German lands long inhabited by the German people were restored to Germany. Among those participating in the parade were the two sons of the deposed Crown Prince and the second son of the deposed Emperor. Prominent German wartime generals, such as deposed Crown Prince, Marshal Mackensen and General Goltz, came to observe. The Steel Helmet League's uniform was semi-military, and they did not carry weapons.

<h3 id="e42">Starts National Assembly Election <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Farmers' Party Unlikely to Win</p>
<p>Bucharest, 31st (National News Agency) - The Romanian National Assembly election, which had been decided to postpone until June 10th, was unexpectedly ordered today to cancel the previous decision and begin the election tomorrow according to the original date. Approximately four million voters will vote for members of parliament. The elected members of parliament will meet on June 15th to hold the opening ceremony of the new National Assembly. As for the Senate, it is merely a decoration. Several days next week will be dedicated to electing senators. According to Romanian election law, women do not have the right to vote, while men over the age of twenty-one can vote for members of parliament. Voting is based on party, not on individual candidates. Whichever party receives the most votes, all of that party's candidates will be elected. The election of senators is very different. Half are publicly elected by the people, and the other half are elected by city councils, state councils, professional groups, universities, churches, and the military. The previous Senate had a total of two hundred and eighty-three members. Four-fifths of the Romanian people are farmers, so the election campaign in January was held in rural areas. Every Sunday after church services, candidates from various parties began political speeches in village squares. Among the parties, the National Farmers' Party won a great victory in the last election, but due to the economic decline during its term in office and the accumulation of public grievances, it is feared that it will suffer a disastrous defeat in this election. Although the Liberal Party has been divided into two factions due to the return of the current king, it may be able to recover some of the seats it lost in the last election. It is expected that no single party will be able to occupy a majority in the new National Assembly, and the Romanian King intends to unite the major factions to form a mixed cabinet so that national affairs are valued more than party politics. However, if the Farmers' Party suffers a disastrous defeat, its leaders will have no intention of joining the government and will prefer to remain in the opposition.</p>

<p>The Peng Huang Surrender Gradually Matures</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The issue of the surrender of Red bandits Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue has undergone several twists and turns, and is gradually maturing. Huang Hanxiang, the military inspection commissioner of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces, was ordered to contact Peng Huang's surrender. He first formulated a concrete plan with He Jian in Hunan, and then secretly contacted a confidant of Peng Huang in Pingxiang. After some progress, Huang returned from Pingxiang to Hunan to meet with He Jian and report to Director He and request instructions on everything. Shortly thereafter, Huang went from the province to Ji'an, then to Yongfeng bandit areas such as Shaxi and Tengtian, to meet with Peng Huang to convey the Central government's intentions and allow them to repent and return. Huang Hanxiang, carrying a adjutant and four soldiers, took the result of the consultation satisfactorily and returned to the province from Yongfeng yesterday, walking from Tengtian to Zi, and then taking a wheel to the Jiangxi Grand Hotel. According to his accompanying adjutant, who spoke to reporters in the city, Peng Huang has recently been oppressed by the Red Party and inevitably has some remorse, so they contacted He Jian to surrender. At the beginning of this matter, Peng Huang sent their families to Changsha as hostages, but due to conditions, there was no result for a long time. This time, Huang Hanxiang met with Huang Gonglue five or six li away from Shaxi and conveyed the intentions of Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Chairman He. He also confirmed all the surrender procedures and conditions. Peng Huang was quite aware of the situation, and his troops have stopped operations on the border of Yongfeng and Ji'an, waiting for the Central government to deal with them. However, there are still one or two points that have not been agreed upon, and Director He is waiting to report them to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for approval. If the authorities accept them, Peng Huang can implement the rebellion and attack Zhu Mao to atone for their sins. It is reported that important representatives of Peng Huang are stationed in Tengtian and Shaxi to facilitate contact at any time. Once the time is ripe, all of them will return. It is said that Huang Hanxiang will stay in the province for a while before going to the Yongfeng front line, and it is expected that he will complete his mission soon. (May 28)</p>
<p>Hubei Provincial Committee</p>
<h3 id="e46">Decides to First Take Office on June 1st <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Liu and Wu Send Personnel to Take Over the Civil and Finance Departments</p>
<p>Chairman He Calls Wu Guozhen to Discuss Finance</p>
<p>Since the Hubei Provincial Government decided to reorganize the court, it is reported that the newly appointed committee members have arrived in Wuhan one after another. Chairman He also returned to Hubei by plane the day before yesterday. Because provincial affairs cannot be stopped, he specifically instructed the secretariat of the provincial government to send letters to the newly appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liu Wendao, and Director of the Finance Department, Wu Guozhen, asking them to take office in June. All new committee members will also come to the provincial government on the same day to take office. After submitting a request to the Central government to appoint a supervising oath commissioner, the oath ceremony will be rescheduled. The secretariat of the provincial government, after receiving instructions from Chairman He, sent letters to the two directors, Liu and Wu, saying, "I am writing to inform you that the provincial government has been ordered to reorganize all the handover procedures of the civil and finance departments, and to order the personnel in charge of the respective departments to expedite the handling and also to send letters to the two directors, Liu and Wu, hoping that they will go to take over on June 1st, etc. Therefore, in addition to ordering and sending separate letters, I hereby send this letter to your director for your information." Therefore, the two civil and finance departments have been rushing to handle the handover for several days and are quite busy. It is reported that the various handover procedures have been prepared yesterday, and each item can be handed over one by one as soon as the new director takes over.</p>
<p>According to political news, the new Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liu Wendao, and the Director of the Finance Department, Wu Guozhen, have notified the civil and finance departments that they will go to take over on June 1st. Liu and Wu have also appointed receiving personnel. Liu has appointed Bi Weiru, Dai Weixia, and Yang Hongzao to the Civil Affairs Department, and Wu has appointed Fan Shi and others to the Finance Department. However, June 1st is the anniversary of the burial of the Prime Minister and the celebration of the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, and all agencies are closed for one day. Therefore, after Liu and Wu take over on June 1st, they must actually go to the hall to start working on the second day. After the new Director of the Finance Department, Wu Guozhen, takes office, his primary problem is how to solve the current financial difficulties. It is reported that Chairman He met with Director Wu at the camp at 12 noon yesterday to discuss how to reorganize the finances of Hubei in the future. Wu gave a very detailed statement at the time, which was greatly appreciated by He. Wu also told the visitors that Hubei's finances have reached the end of the road. If we talk about reorganization, we must first investigate the actual situation of income and expenditure before we can start. The future reorganization plan will start with land taxes, because most provinces in the country rely on land tax revenue to maintain expenditures. If we calculate the area of our entire province of Hubei, it is not weaker than other provinces, so reorganizing the land tax can maintain the expenses of the entire province. Several methods for reorganizing the land tax have been drafted, and after consultation with the committee members, they can be gradually implemented. Secondly, business tax, official property, etc., should also be reorganized. In short, following the committee members, I will do my best to make the provincial treasury sufficient. However, it is difficult to overcome the current financial difficulties without raising a large amount of money, and the provincial savings are only more than 600 yuan. According to news from the Finance Department, approximately 710,000 yuan of expenses are urgently needed to be paid, which have already been notified but have not been paid. The debt to be repaid this month requires another 140,000 yuan in addition to what has already been repaid. The expenses to be paid at the beginning of this month have not yet been included. It is reported that Wu has raised 1 million yuan in preparation for issuing old debts and various expenses in advance after taking office. Furthermore, according to those familiar with the financial situation of the city, after the reorganization of the city government under the provincial government, the expenditure of administrative expenses can be reduced, which can compensate the provincial treasury by approximately 100,000 yuan per month. Other business expenses must still be paid as usual to avoid affecting the city's construction. It is also reported that Mayor Liu has ordered Secretary-General He Fuzhou to be responsible for the handover of the city government. (May 30)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Hankou Chamber of Commerce Cables to Keep Troops Stationed <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Responsible for Eliminating Red Bandits</p>
<p>As the Red bandits are attacking various counties in Hubei Province, there is a deep fear that the troops will be transferred. The Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce requested the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find a solution. The Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially delegated its chairman, He Hengfu, to visit Director He Chengjun on the 29th to ask him not to transfer troops and to cable Commander-in-Chief Chiang with an extremely earnest appeal. The original cable stated: "In recent years, rebellions have been rampant, and bandits have been rampant. The road is full of thorns, and the people are displaced. Fortunately, your Excellency's examination of the chaos and saving the people has brought hope of recovery. The clearing of the countryside and the suppression of bandits have been carried out vigorously. How can it be that the weeds will be removed and the wind and rain will rise again? Hubei is a key point, and its movement affects the overall situation. If the four borders are again in a state of disrepair, then the turbulent Yangtze River will flow eastward, and the future is chilling. This local chamber of commerce is not only pleading for the suffering people who cannot bear to see it, but also earnestly asking your Excellency to examine the situation and order the troops responsible for suppressing bandits in various places to eliminate them within a time limit in order to consolidate the rear defense and protect the lives of the people. I cannot express my gratitude enough for waiting for orders." (May 29)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shanxi Province's Finances are Still Not Optimistic <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>There is Still No Way to Reorganize Provincial Currency</p>
<p>The Funding for Each Army is Waiting to be Negotiated and Distributed</p>
<p>Loans for Food and Fodder are Still a Problem</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since Shang Zhen returned from Beiping with money, he has expressed optimism about the situation in Shanxi. However, in reality, both military expenses and finance are still serious problems. There are approximately two points that Shang is optimistic about: (1) The Central Government has agreed to allocate 1 million yuan per month for the Shanxi army's salaries starting in May. (2) The 2 million yuan in cash brought from Beiping is enough to cope with the difficulties. However, the method for reorganizing the provincial currency has not yet been announced, and rumors have arisen in recent days, and the currency price has become increasingly low. It is now said that the financial reorganization office has drafted a certain method, but it is feared that there is no practical grasp. In fact, if there is no large amount of cash to reorganize the provincial currency, it will ultimately be of no avail. Regarding the funding for each army, the military initially thought that Shang's return would not be a problem. However, after several days of consultation, the distribution has not been completely resolved. Yesterday, a certain important person said that the actual amount of funding that each army should receive was more than 270,000 yuan. This time, it is planned to issue half in cash and half in banknotes. Together with the constabulary and other departments, in addition to the 1 million yuan loan that Shang Zhen brought from Beiping, if the actual amount is issued, there is still a shortage of 700,000 to 800,000 Shanxi banknotes, which must be negotiated again with the relevant parties before a decision can be made. Furthermore, Wang Jingguo, Fu Zuoyi, Rong Honglu, and others returned to Bing from Datong and Sui respectively the day before yesterday. Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun arrived in Bing a few days ago and have not returned to their defenses. The city of Bing is once again a gathering place for generals. The generals staying in Bing went to Song and Pang's residence yesterday morning (the 24th) for a connection. The details are not clear. In recent days, the supply of food and fodder for the garrisons in the southern counties of Shanxi has been interrupted, so the provincial government has approved the raising of 4 million yuan in loans for food and fodder, which has aroused the attention of all parties. The All Circles Trade Abolition Conference specifically held a meeting today to discuss response measures, with some advocating opposition. As for the use of the funds, according to news from the provincial government, it is purely to repay the advance payments made by various counties to purchase food and fodder for the garrisons before May. The total amount of this loan from various counties is approximately more than 6 million yuan. The First Army Food Supervisory Department owed approximately 1.72 million yuan in food and fodder loans to various counties from January to the end of April. The Second Army Food Supervisory Department owed 875,000 yuan. Jincheng, Changzi, and Tunliu counties jointly advanced 480,000 yuan for food and fodder. In addition, the First and Second Supervisory Departments are expected to need another 900,000 yuan in May. The two Supervisory Departments also have temporary loans of more than 1.9 million yuan from various counties. Furthermore, the provincial government borrowed and allocated more than 250,000 yuan to Jincheng and other counties. In addition, the advances made by various counties before November of last year, approximately more than 1.6 million yuan, have not yet been included. In short, it is still difficult to be optimistic about the finances of Shanxi Province. (May 25)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Important Proposals from the Huai River Guidance Conference <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Wang Qingmu's Opinion on Guiding the Huai River into the Sea</p>
<p>During the plenary session of the Huai River Guidance Committee on the 30th, the proposals discussed included Xu Shiying's proposal to guide farmers in developing irrigation projects and negotiations regarding the Italian Boxer Indemnity funds. The most important and fundamental was the plan to guide the Huai River into the sea. Wang Qingmu's original proposal for guiding the Huai River into the sea is recorded below:</p>
<p>It has been over seventy years since the Yellow River changed its course to the north, causing the old course of the Huai River to become silted up. During this period, there have been many proposals to guide the Huai River, and preparations have been made for a long time. Although the goal of actual construction has not been achieved, the guiding principle has always been to release the water into the sea and lower the flood level. Now, the central government is actively proceeding with the Huai River guidance project and has organized a committee in which I, Qingmu, am honored to participate. Having grown up on the coast and being concerned about the benefits and problems of the Jiangsu and Anhui regions, I have some knowledge of the situation. I dare to present a summary of my views. The Huai River flows eastward from Tongbai in Henan for seven hundred *li* to Sanhejian on the border of Henan and Anhui. The mountains and dikes on both banks have always been considered complete and solid. The riverbed slopes steeply, and even if there is accumulated water, it is easily discharged, so there is no significant flooding. From Sanhejian to Bengbu, a distance of four hundred *li*, rivers such as the Ruo, Run, Wo, Qian, Fei, and Ying all flow into the Huai. The length and volume of these rivers are several times greater than that of the Huai River itself, not to mention the countless other tributaries. When there is a lot of water and the slope is gentle, there is no escape from major floods in the autumn. Bengbu is located at the border between Jiangsu and Anhui near Laozi Mountain, a distance of over three hundred *li*. In addition to the tributaries, there are also large rivers such as the Sui, Hui, Tong, Tuo, and Chi joining from the left and right within the territory of Wuhe. Below Gantai and approaching Hongze Lake, the water and land are indistinguishable. In dry seasons, sandbars are everywhere, creating extreme disorder and complexity. From Laozi Mountain along the Hongze Lake levee for over one hundred and forty *li* to Yangzhuang, and then three hundred *li* northeast through Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, and Funing to the sea, lies the old course of the Huai River. Since the Song dynasty, it has been taken over by the Yellow River and is now elevated and rarely flows. This is the overall situation of the Huai River. In total, the Huai River is approximately two thousand one hundred *li* long. In terms of the river course, it is jointly owned by three provinces; in terms of disasters, it is jointly shared by Jiangsu and Anhui. The way to control water is to first understand the composition of the upstream water flow, the actual conditions of the affected areas in each region, and the downstream discharge capacity. An appropriate standard flood level should be pre-determined in the water storage areas in the middle reaches to estimate the urgency of construction and the amount of funds required. According to the Huai River water volume in the most recent twenty years, 1916 and 1921 were years of major floods, with the flood in 1921 being even greater than that in 1916. The measured flow rate was over 14,000 cubic meters per second, and the water level of Hongze Lake was 15 meters above sea level. This is harmful water. If the downstream rivers had the same discharge capacity, the water level would not overflow and inundate the fields, so there would be no disaster. There would be no need to talk about guidance. But in the past, the Huai River and the Yangtze River flowed separately to the sea. Now, there is only the way to the Yangtze River. The full flow rate in 1921 was over 8,000 cubic meters per second, accounting for about three-fifths of the total water flowing into the Huai River. This caused a tragic situation in which tens of counties in northern Jiangsu and Anhui were flooded, with water depths ranging from over ten *chi* to five, six, or seven *chi*. The people of the two provinces regard it as a poisonous snake and a fierce beast, which cannot be kept for a day. This remaining two-fifths of the total water flowing into the Huai River overflows without a destination other than entering the Yangtze River. If this water were stored between Jiangsu and Anhui, the water level of Hongze Lake would already be 15 meters high. The eastern levee of Hongze Lake, which is considered the largest and strongest water control project in our country, is already in a precarious state. How could it withstand further increases? If this water were stored in Gaobao Lake, the water level in ten years would also be more than eight *chi* above sea level, reaching the eastern bank of the Grand Canal, which protects six or seven counties in the lower reaches. If there were any negligence, the people east of the Grand Canal in Gaobao, Xinghua, Dongtai, and Yancheng would suffer the pain of their fish being taken away. Therefore, the problem of guiding the Huai River is the problem of lowering the flood level, which is also the problem of how to handle this remaining two-fifths of the water. Has there ever been a case, in China or abroad, where the water level was lowered but floods still occurred?</p>
<p>I, Qingmu, know that the goal of those who planned to guide the Huai River in the past was to prevent disasters. Is the goal today still the same as before? I dare to say that the disaster of the Huai River is not because it cannot enter the Yangtze River, but because it cannot enter the sea. Even if the water in the Huai River in the most recent twenty years, taking 1921 as the greatest, can be discharged by the Yangtze River, I still dare not be complacent. Because the Huai River is close to the Yangtze River, and the location and climate are completely the same, it is inevitable that the Huai River and the Yangtze River will rise together. Even the water level in September 1921 was sometimes higher than in August 1916, and the discharge into the Yangtze River in 1921 was less than in 1916 because the Yangtze River water level in 1921 was higher than in 1916. Whether my opinion is correct or not, let's not talk about the Huai River water entering the Yangtze River and raising the Yangtze River water level. The sea dikes and weirs in counties north and south of the Yangtze River and the inland discharge are directly affected by the backflow or inundation. Let's not talk about the Yangtze River water rising, even if it is less than a *chi* and the time is only three days. At the moment of slapping against the dikes, this increase, even if it is less than a *chi*, and the inundation, even if it is only three days, is enough to cause a major disaster. For the sake of the safety of the Huai River, there should be another way out as the Yangtze River water gradually rises. Moreover, the water in the Huai River in 1921 was two-fifths greater than in 1916. With today's waterway to the Yangtze River, even without any engineering, the discharge capacity of 9,000 cubic meters per second is its inherent capacity. Now, with full effort focused on entering the Yangtze River, the discharge capacity has not increased. How can we bear to let the remaining water of over 5,000 cubic meters per second cause unprecedented disasters in Jiangsu and Anhui, with the water level of Hongze Lake being 15 meters above sea level? Instead of planning a way out for this water, we set the standard flood level of Hongze Lake at over 16 meters. What is the use of guiding the Huai River? How can we solve the problem of guiding the Huai River to eliminate disasters?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I, Qingmu, have more to say. Matters, whether big or small, each have their principal and subordinate aspects. The safety of the Huai River is the safety of Jiangsu and Anhui. Judging from past facts, focusing solely on the Yangtze River does not address the situation of the Huai River disaster. Even if both the Yangtze River and the sea are considered, the effort may still be insufficient. In the past, the preparations for guiding the Huai River initially focused on diverting the water to the Yangtze River and the sea. After experiencing the major floods of 1916 and 1921, the construction procedure turned to the Yangtze River as subordinate and the sea as primary. Is there any other way? Weighing the advantages and disadvantages, since the harm is great, the primary goal should be to eliminate the harm. The harm of the Huai River is caused by water, and the inundation of fields is caused by the high water level. By lowering the water level, the harm will be eliminated and benefits will arise. If the standard flood level of Hongze Lake is set below 14 meters, ordinary irrigation and transportation will be well served. The design of the main projects, such as the three dams and five ports, should follow the legacy of Jin Wenxiang, returning to the sea via levees. The funds required would be less than 50 million yuan. The construction costs in Anhui would also be similar. Ultimately, it was difficult to raise such a large amount of funds, so it could not be realized. Now, the construction funds obtained from the Boxer Indemnity are only 30 million yuan, which has not yet been allocated. Moreover, whether Jiangsu and Anhui can fully allocate the funds to Jiangsu is uncertain. As for the income proposed by the Engineering Bureau, such as the Yellow River滩地, although nearly one million mu, has been almost released by the Taiwan Camp, official land, and other bureaus over the years. The situation of the lake滩地 is roughly the same. Even if the central and local governments jointly bear the construction costs, it is uncertain whether the 海工程 can be used. If they are divided into two forces, it will inevitably be more short-sighted. This is in terms of funding. In terms of advantages and disadvantages, the effect of returning to the Yangtze River has been described earlier. If 海施工 can be carried out first, then多洩一分入海之水即减少一分地面之災. As for the choice of route, Lin Hongguan River and the old Yellow River were all reviewed once in the past. However, the三壩, such as Gao You以下之車邏新壩南關, also discharged 5,800 cubic meters per second of water during the 1921 flood, but because the坝 water flowed down and overflowed into the fields, the period of启坝 must be after autumn. Such沉災 cannot be easily reduced. If the高寳湖築隄計畫 of the Engineering Bureau can be applied below三壩, or even to涇河 in Bao Ying, then夹隄成渠 can directly reach串塲河 and分輪東川鬥龍新洋射陽等港 to归海上游涨水各坝 timely opening. Even if 江淮并涨 or缩减洩量 for special reasons along the river,归海为之救济. Qingmu deeply hopes to竭全力以助其成,从此江海分流盈虚调剂, and then从从从事于漑灌交通之设计,in in in 得以操纵节制,庶水位得其平,淮灾得其洽,去害生利,江皖永赖矣. 率贡刍蕘,伏祈垂察.谨陈委员长蒋副委员长庄委员王清穆</p>

<h3 id="e50">Coal Merchants Thoroughly Explain Their Losses <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Reply to the Special Party Department of the Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Shandong Zibo Zhangwei Coal Industry Association has been on strike since May 21st, and there has been no resolution after ten days. The losses of both the Jiaoji Railway and the coal merchants are significant, not to mention that the society will also suffer the impact. The Special Party Department of the Jiaoji Railway recently sent a telegram to the Association, requesting that the reasons for the losses be announced to all sectors of society so that they can be reported to the central government for verification and instructions, so that this trend can be resolved as soon as possible. The Shandong authorities are also afraid that the strike will be prolonged or involve local security, so they will come out as mediators and try to resolve it. It is heard that the coal merchants said that if the Jiaoji Railway can increase the freight rate and implement it slowly, the coal merchants will resume transportation first, and then wait for the central government to verify and handle it. Yesterday, the coal merchants sent a telegram to the Jiaoji Railway Party Department, explaining the operating conditions and the pain of losses of their colleagues. The text of the telegram is excerpted below: Your telegram said that the market price of coal is always around 24 yuan, and the calculated cost is only 12 yuan. Comparing the principal and interest, the profit is very high. It is necessary to check the value of coal, and there should be a difference between raw coal and lump coal. If referring to raw coal, each ton only needs 3.5 yuan. Lump coal cannot be done for less than 7 yuan per ton. As for small port retail coal, lump coal is the main component. The lump coal of small port coal merchants is mostly bought from the Boshan coal shop, each vehicle (15 tons) is about 180 yuan. The freight from Boshan to Qingdao is 68.7 yuan per vehicle, and the cost of transferring vehicles and unloading labor is about 10 yuan per vehicle. The total of the three items is 258.7 yuan. The loss of stealing and missing tons along the way for each vehicle of coal accounts for about 5%. Furthermore, converting kilograms into pounds, the deficit accounts for about 2%. The total of these two intangible losses is about one ton. Therefore, each vehicle of 15 tons of coal actually only has 14 tons. Moreover, due to the bumps and vibrations along the way, and the results of loading and unloading, 4 tons of coal are turned into pulverized coal. This pulverized coal can only be sold for 12 yuan per ton, which is worth 48 yuan. Subtracting 48 yuan from 258.7 yuan, the remaining 210.7 yuan is the total cost of the remaining 10 tons of lump coal (the division is suitable for 21.07 yuan per ton). When selling, each ton must be added to the small car to send one yuan, so the cost of lump coal must be more than 22 yuan per ton. Other expenses such as interest, factory rent, etc. are not included. Even according to your telegram, the profit can be easily understood if the selling price is 24 yuan per ton. As far as colleagues who operate export mines are concerned, they are even more strong on the outside and dry on the inside. The pain is even more unknown to outsiders. It is found that export coal is generally raw coal. The mountain price of raw coal is about 3.5 yuan per ton, the cost from the mine to Boshan Station is about 2.5 yuan per ton, the donation tax, stone picking, carrying force, and loading force are about 1 yuan per ton, the Jiaoji Railway's special freight is 2.52 yuan per ton, and all expenses at the Dagang Pier are about 1.5 yuan per ton. The loss of stealing and missing tons along the way accounts for about 40 cents per ton. The total cost is as high as 11.4 yuan per ton. Adding land rent, interest, wages, and all expenses, the actual blood cost is more than 11.5 yuan. However, export coal has been ordered according to the contract. According to the contract signed last winter, each ton is unified at less than 11 yuan. Now, although the cost has increased due to various reasons, the pricing cannot be changed due to credibility. We have to bear the burden and deliver the goods. This kind of loss is already unbearable. If the freight rate is increased by 20%, the loss will be even greater, and the merchant is really unable to maintain it. Therefore, it means that the loss of continuing to transport without canceling the price increase is more significant than the loss of closing the door and suspending business. It is also found that the freight rate of any state-owned railway for coal is lighter than that of the Jiaoji Railway. Taking the Jinpu Railway, which is the closest and also in Shandong Province, for Zhongxing, the freight rate per ton per kilometer is only 5 li. From Boshan to Qingdao, it is 345 kilometers. If calculated according to the central government's 5 li, the freight rate per ton only needs 1.725 yuan, which is compared with the Jiaoji Railway's 4.58 yuan (plus 20% is 5.496 yuan) for the mainland and 2.52 yuan (plus 20% should be 3.024 yuan) for export. The difference is not more than doubled. With such a huge difference in freight rates, how can the price of coal in the mainland not increase? How can export coal compete with others? Merchants have repeatedly appealed to request the reduction of the freight rate. Isn't it all moaning without illness? Now, not only has the request for price reduction not been adopted and implemented, but there is also a sudden increase of 20%. Directly, it makes our colleagues unbearable, and indirectly, it increases the burden on the people. What is more unfair than this? Now, I am consulted, and I will report the daily operating conditions of my colleagues and the pain of losses to you. Please check and report to the central government that the price increase should be canceled first and the summer rebate should be restored, and a fair freight rate should be re-established by comparing the freight rates of state-owned railways. On the one hand, please convey to all parties so as to clarify the truth and provide assistance. It is not only the luck of the mine coal merchants, but also the actual benefit of the people of both Shandong provinces. (May 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Implementing Governance in the Western Adjacent Mongolian Wilderness <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Changing the Wilderness Affairs Bureau to a Governance Bureau</p>
<p>The location for governance has also been selected</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Western Adjacent Mongolian Wilderness in Liaoning Province has a vast area of fertile land. The Adjacent Wilderness Bureau is set up to survey, measure, govern, and plan for the establishment of governance. The Adjacent Wilderness Bureau previously requested the implementation of governance in the Western Adjacent Wilderness. After deliberation by the Provincial Government Committee, it was decided that the Adjacent Wilderness Bureau would continue to handle it concurrently. The most important thing is to release the Mongolian wilderness to maintain public security. If there is no way to maintain public security, there is no hope for the wilderness affairs to improve. The Wilderness Bureau previously decided to collect 20 yuan of guarding fee for each released side of cultivated land and 10 yuan for raw wilderness, in order to fill the security equipment. It was already expected that this would be the case. As a result, the land could not be released at all. The pre-determined guarding fee was already a pie in the sky. If the land tax was to be collected according to the land, the entire section of the wilderness was said to be 5,6000 sides, but the actual cultivated land was only 2,000 sides. According to the usual practice of the Eastern Adjacent Wilderness, only three of every ten ridges of cultivated land are taxed, and the people still cannot bear the hardship and abandon it to move elsewhere. Therefore, only 400 sides of the 2,000 sides of cultivated land in the Western Adjacent Wilderness actually pay the land tax. A drop in the bucket is of no help. In addition, the people who are in the famine are too busy to save the dead and have no time to care about other things. Therefore, the method of paying land tax according to the land is impossible. It is also found that since the date of surveying and surveying the Western Adjacent Wilderness until now, more than 450,000 yuan of surveying expenses have been spent, more than 200,000 yuan of official wilderness bureau expenses have been spent, and the Mongolian bureau expenses are self-funded and not included. The total expenditure of both official and Mongolian parties is actually no less than 500,000 yuan. It has been released for three months, and according to the report of the Adjacent Wilderness Bureau, only 22,000 yuan of price money has been collected, which is less than 5% of the expenditure. If this continues to be supported and the plan is not changed urgently, the result of the plan to enrich the country and benefit the people will be the opposite. Now the Provincial Government has decided to change the Wilderness Affairs Bureau to a Governance Bureau. The trend of focusing on releasing the wilderness is now changed to focusing on the establishment of governance. The administrative department that was planned to be attached to the Wilderness Affairs Bureau is now changed to the Wilderness Affairs Department attached to the Governance Bureau. This can be effective in adapting to the times. The Governance Plan plans to compile and train a number of police groups in the location of the Governance Bureau and in the wilderness section, according to the method of drawing Ding by household and dividing the area for guerrilla warfare. The guns will be lent from the 1,000 Czech surplus guns purchased and stored by the former Provincial Office, and the price will be paid in installments over the years. The money will not be spent and things will be easily gathered. With the convenience of transportation and the large amount of cultivated land in the wilderness, it will not be difficult for the households to follow suit after the bandits are eliminated in the future. The expenses of the Governance Bureau should be paid by the Provincial Treasury. The detailed plans for how to organize the rest of the Governance Bureau and how to compile, supervise, and be responsible for the safekeeping of the police groups will be made by the Governance Officer. As for the location of the Governance Bureau in the Western Adjacent Wilderness, the Eastern and Western Adjacent Wilderness Bureaus have selected the village of Jiatutu. The soil is fertile, the residences are numerous, the Beidongxin River surrounds it, and the southwest ridges undulate. The mountains and waters are quite good. It is 60 *li* south of the Dalin Station on the Zheng-Tong Railway and 60 *li* east of the Sanlin Station on the Si-Tao Railway. The transportation is convenient. It is 90 *li* north of the Zhaoyou County boundary and about 30 *li* west of the Muchi. The number may not stop there after it is delineated in the future. And the Jiatutu place is actually the center of the Western Adjacent Wilderness and is the most suitable place for establishing a county governance. In terms of the 隣 counties, Liaoyuan is in the southeast and Tongliao is in the southwest, each about 100 *li* away, forming a tripod. It is not only easy to contact, but also convenient to control for developing the Mongolian border and suppressing bandits. In addition, in terms of the surrounding situation, Jiatutu is just located on a straight line with Kailu in Rehe to the west and Changling in Jilin to the east. If railways can be connected in the future, it can become the liaison channel for the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Rehe. The location is very important. It is very valuable to establish a county. The initial plan is to temporarily place the Governance Bureau in the western part of the Sidao Road Sanlin Station Railway near the wilderness in order to manage the Western Adjacent Wilderness and build a new county street at ease to relieve financial strength and help the difficult times.

<h3 id="e52">The Movement of Gentlemen and Elders in Fushun County to Move the County Office <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>When Fushun County in Liaoning Province was first established, the county office was originally located in Fushun City. Later, considering the diplomatic relations, the Provincial Office approved the relocation of the county office to Qianjinzai in the fifth year of the Republic of China. However, the Fushun Coal Mine of the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company is located near the village. Due to mining, the earth's core often shakes, and buildings that are slightly less strong and have been around for a long time often collapse. It is extremely dangerous, and the ground is low-lying. Every summer and autumn, the continuous rain cannot be drained, and floods often occur. It is not a place for the county government to stay. Therefore, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the county office was moved to the Datong Inn in the far north of Zhaipu to avoid danger. However, in recent years, due to Japan's encroachment policy, most of the street surface of Qianjinzhaipu has been归于日人, and the rights of the landlords have been almost lost. The Fushun Coal Mine is expanding its mining area, so there is no day in Zhaibei that there is no huge earthquake. The dangerous situation is no less than the place where the county office was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China. The county office is the main brain of a county and cannot always be in a dangerous place. Therefore, the movement to move the county office has started again. However, the gentlemen and elders of the county have different opinions. Some advocate moving back to Fushun City, and some advocate moving to Yulinpu. There is still no consensus. Recently, Zhang Shishi and other gentlemen and elders of the county came to the province to submit a report to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Government, advocating moving back to Fushun County City. From the perspective of national rights, commerce, transportation, and administration, the general idea is that regarding national rights, the most complicated negotiations between Fushun and Japan are related to the Qianjinzai Coal Mine, and the rest are branches and unimportant. However, the county office can handle the negotiation matters in Qianjinzai, and it can also be handled in Fushun City. Moreover, being in Fushun City is better than being in Qianjinzai, away from the encirclement of the concession and having the power of freedom and independence. If it is moved to Yulinpu, it is still in the mining area, and its弊害 is the same as Qianjinzai. It is not a long-term solution. Regarding commerce and transportation, Fushun City has the east-west 瀋海鐵路. It is safe to develop business with ease, and it can臻臻日上, and it can avoid Japanese restraint. The Shenyang Station on the 瀋海路 is more than 20 miles away from Fushun, which is closer than the Fengtian on the South Manchuria Railway to Fushun Station. The transportation of goods should be equal to the 瀋海. Yulinpu is farther away from the station, and the newly opened market is not very prosperous. After all, the transportation is inconvenient. Regarding administration, when the county government was first established in Fushun City, it was inconvenient for farmers to封糧 and pay donations. Now that there is an east-west transverse railway, the 瀋海鐵路 is also planning to build a north-south transportation bridge. The transportation in all directions is convenient and infinite, and the administrative facilities are easy to do and can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Compared to Yulinpu, which is located in a remote corner, it cannot be compared. It is heard that the Provincial Office considers the opinions of the gentlemen to be fair and is now carefully examining them to determine an appropriate solution. A few gentlemen and elders in the province, such as Zhang Shishen, have recently published an opinion letter in addition to visiting the authorities to petition, intending to achieve their goal.</p>

<p>The Head of the Bandit Gang in Xudong, Who Reigned for Ten Years, Has Been Killed</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The bandit gang in Xudong, who appears between Suqian and Sui, is known as the most ferocious one, headed by He Lao Gangzi. The bandit gang has been weakened after successive suppressions by Zhang Huatang's cavalry division and Zhang Zhankui's cavalry third division. He, who has been based in Xudong for ten years, is extremely cunning and has many liaisons with local evil gentry. When the power is strong, he robs and massacres. When the power is weak, he goes into hiding elsewhere and is difficult to capture. On the 20th of this month, He led his gang of more than 40 people to occupy Duanzhuang, a few *li* west of Xin'an Town. Yin, the captain of the engineer battalion of the 12th Division stationed in Xin'an, learned of this and led his team to suppress them. When they approached Duanzhuang, the bandits fired their guns to meet them, and the soldiers immediately advanced and attacked fiercely. At that time, the nearby militia heard the news and rushed to contact Captain Yin to surround Duanzhuang on all sides. On the one hand, they used artillery to bombard and on the other hand, they set fire to burn. More than half of the bandits were killed or injured. The remaining bandits could not support themselves and fled north of the village. They were surrounded and intercepted by the army, and two were captured alive, and the rest were killed. Four handheld machine guns, more than ten shell guns, and more than twenty rifles were seized, and two hostages were rescued. He has been killed in the village.

<p>Repeat Thief Zhang Aqi Arrested: Recently, theft cases have occurred frequently inside and outside the city, such as at Pujitang, the County Second High School, the County Experimental School, and Lianqing Nunnery. Theft from private homes is especially common. The detectives of the County Public Security Bureau have made few arrests, leading to the emboldening of thieves, which is a cause for concern among all sectors. Director Shen specifically instructed Inspector Yang Ganjie yesterday to be responsible for investigating all theft cases and ensure they are solved.

<p>Four Robbery Cases Occur in One Day: Recently, robbery cases in the four townships have been on the rise. Although local police and militia have been strictly suppressing them, few arrests have been made. On the previous day, as many as four robbery cases occurred, which is a cause for concern regarding public security. The details are as follows: (1) The Lao Ban barge from Wuxi to Huashu, Jiangyin, was sailing from the countryside to the city on the night prior. As the boat reached Cuoying Bridge on the east side of Chang'an Bridge, more than ten people wearing tattered military uniforms and civilian clothes, each carrying box cannons and flashlights, suddenly appeared and ordered the boat to stop, falsely claiming to be searching for opium. They boarded the boat and robbed Song Yicheng and a passenger surnamed Lu of a leather bag, a gold ring entrusted to a Mr. Hua for pawning, a gold bracelet, more than twenty yuan in silver, a quilt, a bamboo basket, and several items of clothing. At the same time, the new Huashu barge behind them was also robbed, including a leather robe entrusted to Shen Zhongliang for pawning, more than thirty yuan in silver, and quilts and clothing. The total losses from both boats amounted to about two hundred yuan. The boatmen Zhang Rongquan and Lin Gencquan did not report the incident to the county because it was during the silkworm cocoon season and traffic was heavy. (2) Xia Azheng and his two brothers, farmers from Hualian Bridge near Hongshengli, were slightly wealthy due to their diligence in farming. On the night prior, a small boat from Jiangbei suddenly arrived near the beach, carrying five or six bandits with weapons. After 11:00 PM, they swarmed into Xia's house and robbed them for half an hour before leaving, resulting in a loss of more than one hundred yuan. Azheng's younger brother, Axiang, was also beaten. (3) Shen Jinhua, a merchant from elsewhere, runs a small sundry shop at the south end of Li Bridge, at the border of Kaiyuan and Yangming townships. One morning, someone suddenly entered the shop under the pretext of buying cigarettes. Three bandits rushed in and robbed the shop of all its silver, foreign currency, goods, and clothing. Shen is old and has been completely impoverished by this incident. (4) At Zhou Mingbiao's house, No. 23, next to the Catholic Church at Xiaosanli Bridge outside the North Gate, a large number of bandits also came and robbed them of gold, silver, gold rings, and other items. After Zhou Mingbiao reported the incident, the police from the 5th branch station went to pursue the robbers and arrested the bandits Xu Erbao and Xu Amao on the spot. They were immediately taken to the station, and after a preliminary trial by Branch Chief Peng, they were sent to the General Administration yesterday for transfer to the County Court for strict legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Firearms Seized in Anquan Village, Jiangyin: The Jiangyin-Changzhou Pacification Division Command has been actively conducting anti-banditry operations and has appointed Huang Bingzhong as a detective in the eight counties of Suzhou and Changzhou. Recently, detective Mao Genyuan arrested Han Linbao, a native of Hengtang, Jiangyin, in Shanghai. He claimed that he had been working as a waiter at the Bandai Shengchang Shipping Company in Hangzhou and Huzhou since April of last year. After being sent to the command headquarters, he was interrogated twice. Yesterday (31st), he was sent to the county for custody. On the night of the 31st of last month, detectives from the command searched Anquan Village, Dongwai Sanguan Township, and arrested Lu Jinbao (also known as Lin Cai), seizing five box guns and 350 rounds of ammunition. He was taken to the command headquarters for processing.</p>
<p>Police Station Detains Strange Man: Kang Yongzhong, a patrol officer of the First Police Station of the Ninth Public Security Branch, led several policemen on patrol to the Zhensanxia area on the afternoon of the previous day when they saw a man with suspicious behavior. They questioned him, and he claimed to be Chen Jinhe, 37 years old, residing in Xuxiang Town, currently serving as an officer in the Southern Five Provinces Water and Land Army and the Presidential Guard. Patrol Officer Kang, believing his words to be incoherent and indicative of madness, ordered the police to search him. Inside his small rattan basket, they found two "Marshal Chen Li" large seals, two small square seals, a "Chen Bi Ji Camp" chop, two wooden Shangfang swords, two tiger-headed Shangfang command arrows, sixty-one red and white business cards, and short shirts, pants, and shoes, all of which were taken to the station. After a preliminary trial by Branch Chief Liu, he was sent to the General Bureau for verification yesterday.</p>
<p>Money Shop Apprentice Steals Huge Sum and Flees: An apprentice at the Dachangyong Money Shop in Beitan stole 3,000 yuan in banknotes and foreign currency from the silver room at around 10:00 AM yesterday and disappeared without a trace. After the shop's manager, Qian Zanqing, noticed, he immediately ordered people to search for him, but he had already vanished without a trace. It is speculated that the apprentice's disappearance is related to a small boss from a mountain goods store named Zhou, who vouched for the apprentice.</p>

It is reported that in the eastern township of Qishuyan, only Li Tongyi and Fuchang have opened, both opening on the 31st and collecting only a few loads of cocoons, with a price of 40 to 45 yuan. Longhua Cocoon in Tangqiao also opened on the afternoon of the same day, with a price of around 45 yuan. The situation is similar in the western township of Mahangqiao's Huafeng Cocoon, which also opened on the 31st and collected few goods, with a price of 53 yuan. The situation is roughly the same in other townships, with some opening late on June 1st or 2nd.</p>

<p>Shen Hancai Stabs and Injures Multiple People: Shen Hancai, a native of Nantong, is 20 years old and has been working at Jiang Songran's rattan shop for the past few years. He then stopped working there and went to work at Wei Jinshun's rattan shop, but was dismissed for being unreasonable. Shen now lives at Tao Jin's house in Sangyuanlang outside the South Gate and teaches Tao's son, Genlin, how to make rattan furniture. Shi Jinhai, who lives nearby, has a daughter named Xiaosanyuan who is quite attractive. Shen Hancai asked Zhang Fubao's wife to act as a matchmaker. The horoscopes have been exchanged, but no ceremonies have been performed yet. Shen often roams around with a flashlight every evening. When the flashlight is shone, the villagers, not knowing what it is, suspect him of being a bandit. As a result, Shen's actions have been noticed by nearby residents. On the evening of the 31st, at 7 or 8 PM, Shen passed by again with a flashlight, and when the light shone, farmers who had just returned from the fields reprimanded him. Shen responded with vicious words, causing a crowd to become angry and beat him severely. Shen struggled to escape home, where he retrieved two small knives and confronted the crowd. As a result, Shi Gensheng's chest was pierced, Shen Yugen was injured in the right chest, Shi Erda was trying to take the knife when four fingers of his right hand were cut off, and Shen Laobing was injured in his left arm and back. At the time, the injured were bleeding profusely. Shen, realizing he had caused a great disaster, fled towards Zifusi. However, the shouts of "catch the thief" reached far and wide. Shi Jinshou and Xia Jintian heard the shouts and gave chase, capturing the perpetrator and reporting it to the Sanliqiao Second Branch Station. The police station sent out police officers, and the four seriously injured were taken to Jishan Hospital in the North Gate for treatment. The perpetrator was taken to the Second Branch Station and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention pending interrogation.</p>

Subsequently, a repayment plan was submitted, which was considered appropriate. He then ordered that it be strictly followed.

The fire quickly spread through the roof. The fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after an hour. Two rooms on the upper floor were burned down, but the lower floor and the shops on the left and right were fortunately spared. The loss was over 400 yuan. Some silk merchants from Changxing had stored goods worth more than ten yuan at the shop, which were all burned. It is said that when the fire broke out, four employees of the shop were asleep. They were awakened by the fire and found themselves surrounded by flames and unable to go downstairs. They had to jump from the upper floor window. Gao Gensheng, 50, injured his back and is in critical condition, while Zhou Yuelin injured his leg. The shop sent Gao and Zhou to the Fuyin Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Recognizes Professors' Demands as Inappropriate</p>
<p>Amended School Regulations Cannot Be Revoked</p>
<p>Yesterday, Teachers and Students Held a Meeting and Sent Representatives to Beijing</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st – The Ministry of Education believes that the Qinghua student unrest, the rejection of Wu Nanxuan, and the faculty's demand to withdraw the amended school regulations are inappropriate. Today, it specifically ordered Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, to go to Qinghua to convey the Ministry's intentions and declare: (1) The amended school regulations cannot be returned to their previous state. (2) The appointed president cannot be replaced.</p>
<p>Beiping, 1st – Qinghua students held a general meeting today and resolved to form a school affairs maintenance committee to request the local authorities to retrieve the Qinghua seal taken by Wu Nanxuan. They dispatched Lin Wenkui, Liu Hanwen, and Wang Lu to Nanjing within days to petition the Ministry to replace Wu Nanxuan and report the true situation of the unrest. The faculty association also held a general meeting today and appointed representatives to petition the Ministry of Education to remove Wu Nanxuan within days. (Beiping Special Dispatch) Since Wu Nanxuan became president of Qinghua University, it has been over a month, and he has been unable to cooperate with the faculty. Regarding the issue of deans, disputes have arisen over whether deans should be recommended by the faculty and then appointed by the president, or appointed entirely by the president. Recently, after Wu Nanxuan returned to Beiping from Beijing, the Ministry of Education's Directive No. 1683 amended Article 7 of the Qinghua school regulations, "Each of the three colleges of arts, science, and law shall have a dean, who shall be appointed by the president from among the professors," by deleting the phrase "from among the professors." The original Article 10 stated, "Each department shall have several professors, associate professors, and lecturers, who shall be appointed by the president with the consent of the appointment committee, and several teaching assistants, who shall be appointed by the department head after consultation with the president, provost, and dean." This was changed to "Each department shall have several professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, who shall be appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the dean." As a result, most of the faculty believed that this reform was dangerous for the future of Qinghua. On the afternoon of the 28th, they held a faculty meeting and telegraphed the Ministry of Education to replace Wu Nanxuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Professors' Document Presented to the Ministry of Education <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In addition to telegraphing Beijing on the 28th to appoint another wise and capable person, the professors also sent a document to the Ministry of Education. The following is a record of it:</p>
<p>A petition requesting that the school regulations be revised in a comprehensive manner and that another wise and capable person be appointed as the president of the school. This school's regulations were specifically formulated by your ministry with reference to the situation of this school. Since they were promulgated by your ministry in June of the 18th year, they have been followed until now and are very appropriate in all aspects. Even in the past year, when this school experienced unrest and the environment was extremely harsh, school affairs did not come to a standstill, and various plans were able to develop as usual. This was due to the appropriate guidance of your ministry and also to the effectiveness of this school's regulations. The spirit of this school's regulations is to make the president and professors responsible for school affairs to a considerable extent. Therefore, even if the president leaves, school affairs can still not come to a standstill. The University Organization Law promulgated by the National Government on July 26 of the 18th year also gives the highest authority of a university to the school affairs meeting, which is organized by the president, deans, department heads, and representatives elected by the professors. Its spirit and purpose are also the same as this school's regulations. Now, Directive No. 1683 of your ministry amends three articles of this school's regulations. According to the newly amended regulations, the deans may not be appointed from among the professors, and the original appointment committee is also abolished. The appointment and dismissal of professors is decided by the president and deans. Such regulations are not the original spirit of this school's regulations and seem to deviate from the legislative intent of the University Organization Law. The directive from your ministry states that after the organizational and staffing regulations of various universities have been compiled, there will be a comprehensive plan. Therefore, if there are any revisions to this school's regulations, your ministry should consider the situation of this school and make comprehensive revisions. This is the first request of this association. The result of the amendments made by your ministry to this school's regulations is to infinitely expand the power of the president. This occurred at a time when President Wu Nanxuan was reporting to your ministry in the capital. Perhaps your ministry listened to President Wu's one-sided report, which is why there was this one-sided amendment to this school's regulations. Since arriving at the school, President Wu has first caused disputes over the issue of deans. According to the original regulations, the deans of this school were to be appointed by the president from among the professors. Since the promulgation of these regulations, the faculty association and former President Luo had discussed having the faculty association recommend two people from each college, from whom the president would select one for appointment. Within the scope of the law, the opinions of the professors were accommodated. The intention was not to allow the school to be too affected by the president's departure and to allow everything to proceed steadily. Even in the past when there was no president, your ministry telegraphed to elect deans, which went on for a long time and was beneficial without any harm. However, after President Wu arrived at the school, he first proposed to abolish this practice and refused to convene a faculty meeting to discuss the matter, which caused the issue to remain unresolved for a long time. The dean appointed by President Wu from among the professors did not dare to accept the appointment. President Wu happened to be in Beijing at this time, and your ministry amended the regulations. Such is the truth about the so-called deans issue. President Wu has taken over all power in managing the school. Since arriving at the school, in addition to the school affairs meeting not being able to be held due to the unresolved dean issue, the council has not met once. The dean he appointed on his own was unpopular, and when he announced the appointment, the whole school was shocked. Furthermore, because of the dean issue, he convened student tea parties to attack the faculty, using sensational language. There is absolutely no comprehensive plan for the development of academics. Any statements made are fragmented and do not conform to the actual situation of the school. On the one hand, he deceives the faculty, and on the other hand, he treats them like employees. Although the professors want to wholeheartedly assist, they have no way to do so. Before, when the National Government issued clear orders to rectify education, the professors and others were all overjoyed, believing that Qinghua would therefore become more advanced. The National Government also carefully entrusted President Wu with the important task of developing the school. When President Wu first arrived at the school, the professors and others also wanted to jointly contribute to the great cause. However, President Wu has only been at the school for over a month and has already destroyed the good foundation that this school had obtained with great difficulty. This means that President Wu has harmed Qinghua and betrayed the trust of the National Government. The National Government's judgment of people is also something that the professors and others are particularly distressed about after their indignation. We hope that your ministry will consider the difficulty of this school's current situation and specially request that the National Government appoint another wise and capable person as the president of this school. This is the second request of this association. This school has a total of 59 full-time professors. 45 people attended today's meeting. By a large majority of 38 to 2 votes, it was passed to report the true situation of this school to your ministry. We humbly hope that your ministry will take appropriate action. This school will be fortunate, and higher education in China will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education and concurrently Minister Jiang Guoli of the Qinghua University Faculty Association, May 28, 20th year.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Student General Meeting <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 28th, the student representative meeting of the school was held and reached a consensus with the professors. At 9:00 a.m. on the 29th, a general meeting of all students was reconvened, with approximately 400 of the 599 students present. The following important matters were resolved: (1) Request the Ministry of Education to dismiss Wu Nanxuan, and have all students march to the principal's residence to request his immediate departure. If Mr. Wu is not at the school, send a letter to Mr. Wu requesting his immediate departure. (Passed by 313 votes) (2) Have all students march to the residences of Chen Shifu, Zhong Luzhai, and Zhu Yicheng to request their immediate departure. (Passed by 295 votes) (3) Request the Ministry of Education to appoint Mr. Zhou Yichun as principal. If the Ministry disregards the public opinion of Qinghua students and appoints another person as principal, the school will resolutely reject them. (Passed by 201 votes) (4) Before the new principal arrives, the association (all students) will send a letter to the faculty council requesting them to temporarily maintain educational affairs, and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting immediate approval. (Passed by 221 votes) (5) Request the library director, Hong Fanwu, to leave the school. (Passed by 199 votes) (6) Request the Ministry of Education to immediately restore the original organizational regulations of the university. (Passed by 213 votes) (7) Send three representatives to Zhou Yichun (who previously served as the principal of Qinghua for five years) to invite him to be the principal of the school. (Passed by 211 votes) After the meeting adjourned, all the students marched to Wu Nanxuan's residence to request his departure, but Mr. Wu had already left. Next, they went to the residences of Chen Shifu and Zhu Yicheng. Mr. Chen came out to meet them, and the student representatives stated the public opinion of the students, requesting his departure. Mr. Chen immediately agreed to leave. All the students cheered three times. They then went to the residence of the newly appointed Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Zhong Luzhai, to request his departure. This was the situation in the morning. In the afternoon, classes continued as usual.</p>

It was resolved that the Municipal Education Bureau should initiate the organization of a committee to jointly plan and implement practical measures. 2. How to advise various banks, factories, and stores to notify the institute at any time when they need personnel and trainees for selection and introduction, or entrust the institute to conduct examinations on their behalf. It was resolved that, on the one hand, agencies that have already implemented this should be turned into advocacy introductions, and on the other hand, the results and effectiveness of the institute's talent examinations should be reported to the society. 3. Should the institute liaise with the personnel departments of various agencies to promote the implementation of examination and testing methods when hiring talents, in order to ensure appropriate personnel placement? It was resolved that this case can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the institute will convene a meeting of the heads of personnel departments of various agencies to discuss liaison methods. In the second stage, the testing issue will be considered and implemented by the personnel departments of various agencies. 4. What departments should the vocational specialized supplementary school run by the society establish this year to meet social needs? It was resolved that the subjects offered can be determined by consulting the talent needs of various factories. 5. How to promote the establishment of vocational schools specializing in various industries, each creating suitable talent for their own needs? It was resolved that the educational and vocational sectors should communicate effectively, and that specialized schools should be established within major factories to provide ambitious young people with more opportunities for work-study programs. 6. The society's future direction. It was resolved to liaise more with administrative and industrial agencies to actively promote [vocational education]. If there are any opinions, they can be expressed in writing for the institute's reference.</p>

<p>Total of Fourteen Battles, Eleven Wins, Three Losses</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Sports School eastward expedition basketball team of twelve people returned to Shanghai by Fengtian Maru at 3:30 yesterday afternoon. More than 100 people, including members of the school's boy scout, staff and students of the Chinese Sports School, and representatives from all walks of life, came to the port to welcome them. Music and gunshots were played at the same time, making them extremely enthusiastic. After landing, they took a car back to school. Liangjiang decided to hold a grand celebration meeting today. People from the education and sports circles in the city will launch a public banquet to comfort the players.</p>
<p>The Liangjiang basketball team's expedition to Japan totaled ten times, namely once in Nagasaki, once in Tokyo West, twice in Osaka, once in Kyoto, Nara, and Kobe. However, the competition in Kyoto was not on the scheduled program, but was temporarily made as an informal practice at the strong request of a women's high school. When Liangjiang players took the field, they retired halfway due to fatigue from the journey and exhaustion after visiting scenic spots. Therefore, the official competition totaled nine times, and six times they won. After that, they won all three battles in Korea. After arriving in Dalian, they won two more battles. In total, they won eleven victories in fourteen battles. According to the Liangjiang team's trip, they have achieved very satisfactory results with a spirit of fearlessness, which not only shines the brilliance of the women's sports world, but also increases the glory of international ball games.</p>

<p>(Huang Jiping, 19th, in Korea)</p>
<p>(Gyeongseong Correspondence) The Liangjiang basketball team competed against the Sukmyeong Women's High School team, the Korean women's basketball championship team, at 5:00 pm on the 18th at the Youth Association basketball hall. The audience was extremely enthusiastic on that day. Our overseas Chinese community accounted for one-third of them. Students from the Renchuan Overseas Chinese Elementary School, more than 100 miles away from Gyeongseong, also came from afar. Counting the Japanese and Koreans, the number should be more than a thousand people. The basketball hall was crowded from top to bottom. Those who arrived late still stood outside the door, waiting quietly for the battle. Li Huize and Jin Zhongwan were invited as referees. When the Sukmyeong players squeezed out from the crowd, each of them was tall and strong, with high spirits. At a glance, they were known to be a strong enemy that was not easy to invade. The Liangjiang players walked quickly into the court, lively and exquisite, and were greatly praised by the Japanese and Korean people. After the two teams fought, there was no progress in passing each other for three minutes. Shao Jinying from Liangjiang won the ball, rushed forward quickly, and shot it in from a distance. Soon, Long Jingyun was fined one point and then Yang Ren passed it over and threw it into the basket. Gao Shun of Sukmyeong was fined twice but missed both times. The first quarter ended with a score of 5 to 0. After a two-minute break, the second quarter began. The Liangjiang players were a hundred times more courageous. The ball was passed to them, and Sukmyeong had no choice. Liangjiang scored fourteen points in a row and Sukmyeong scored two points. The halftime score was 19 to 2. Liangjiang won the applause of the audience. The third quarter started and the Sukmyeong players changed their tactics in the hope of regaining the declining trend. Liangjiang Ren exited and Tu Yunsheng replaced him, making the momentum even stronger. Shao Jinying and Long Jingyun each showed magical calculations and scored twelve points in a row. Since then, the Sukmyeong team was panicked and missed many opportunities. Liangjiang won another 16 to 0. The last quarter was 6 to 3. As a result, Liangjiang won with a score of 41 to 5. Our overseas Chinese compatriots cheered loudly and the whole audience was shocked. The Sukmyeong players burst into tears after a crushing defeat, which is also a fun thing on the court.</p>

<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) The details of the Liangjiang Women's School basketball team's three consecutive victories in Gyeongseong, Korea, have been seen in the previous correspondence. On the afternoon of the 21st, the players visited the Gyeongseong Science Museum and various scenic spots. On the morning of the 22nd, they went to Pyongyang, which is the second largest city in Korea. There are more than 2,000 overseas Chinese compatriots here. They sent letters and telegrams in advance to welcome the Liangjiang team and held a friendly match with the Pyongyang Women's High School. On the afternoon of the same day, when they arrived at the port at 3:00 pm, representatives from the KMT Direct Branch, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and other groups and more than 1,000 overseas Chinese compatriots gave them a warm welcome. They went to Dongshenglou to rest at 5:00 pm and visited Fubilou, Yongmyeong Temple, Xuanwu Gate, Peony Terrace, Miltai, and Jizi Mausoleum. Peony Terrace is the location of the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. Because our army was weak in those years, it was unfortunately defeated. Japan annexed our Korean vassals, and their ambition to invade China began here. The peony terrace has a pavilion called the Most Victorious Terrace. The plaques are all written in Japanese to commemorate the Japanese army's victory. The beams of the pavilion and the ancient pine trees around it still have bullet holes. We cannot help but burst into tears when we mourn. At 5:00 pm, we went to the Prefectural Museum to visit, which contains relics from the Lelang Commandery era, the Goguryeo era, and the Jinshi era, all of which are more than 1,700 years old. They are all historically valuable, but it is a pity that they have been lost in foreign lands. At 9:00 pm that evening, all sectors of the overseas Chinese community held a grand welcome meeting. In his speech, team leader Lu Lihua reported on the competition in Japan and Korea and his thoughts after traveling to the east. He also gave sincere words to the overseas Chinese compatriots. On the 23rd, he contacted all parties to arrange the competition. Japanese and Korean schools declined because of insufficient strength, and they went to Andong in the afternoon. On the morning of the 24th, they arrived in Shenyang at 6:30 am. The basketball teams of various schools could not compete because they attended the North China Games. They visited Northeastern University, Beiling, and Fengyong University in the afternoon and left Shenyang for Dalian at 8:30 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Double Victory in Dalian <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>33 to 17 Great Victory over Yayoi</p>
<p>19 to 12 Another Victory over Shinmei</p>
<p>(Dalian Correspondence) The Liangjiang Women's Sports School eastward expedition basketball team left the country on April 25th and crossed the sea to the east. In the previous month and five days, they fought fiercely in various places in Japan for nine times and won six victories. They also won all three battles in Korea. Their name is full of the Eastern Seas and they returned home with honors. On May 25th, they transferred from Shenyang to Dalian and were recruited by the South Manchurian Sports Association to agree to compete with Dalian Yayoi and Shinmei Women's High Schools. Yayoi and Shinmei Schools believed that the Liangjiang team's ball skills were superb, and the long expedition had returned and their experience was richer. This opportunity could be used to receive the effect of "taking the jade of other mountains to attack mistakes." In order to maintain the reputation of the ever-victorious army, Liangjiang had to be cautious in these last two battles in order to achieve satisfactory results. People from all sectors of the Lianbin Chinese community also had this hope. Sure enough, Liangjiang defeated Yayoi in one battle and Shinmei in the second battle. The prestige shook far and wide and it was indeed a well-deserved reputation. In particular, the triumphant sound will remain in Lianbin forever. It is also the most glorious page in the history of women's sports in our country. The two strategic situations are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. Yayoi The time was 5:00 pm on May 27th. The heroines of the two teams competed at the Dalian Sports Field. More than 2,000 spectators looked up and danced with joy. Almost all of them were from our Chinese community. Waves of applause were sent into their ears and the warm welcome was evident. After the two teams were set up, they began to fight under the judgment of Harada and Tsukimi. After only two seconds, Yang Ren, the right wing of Liangjiang, got a ball passed from Shao Jinying and shot it in from a close distance to open the record. Suddenly the air became tense and murderous. Kaikyung, the center of the meeting, suddenly passed a ball to Shao and threw it quickly towards the goal. It entered leisurely. Seeing that the situation was not good, Yayoi held an emergency meeting to plan a countermeasure and the entire army fought hard. Akishiyama, the right wing, put in a ball. After several minutes of melee, Zhuang Shuyu and Wang Lan, the rear guards of Liangjiang, guarded the rear, and Yayoi could not succeed. The first quarter ended and Liangjiang took the lead with an advantage of 8 to 3. After a one-minute break, the battle started again. Liangjiang worked hard to suppress the enemy, passed the ball left and right, and Shao and Long frequently put in several balls. Yayoi was at a loss and panicked. At the sound of the gun, the first half ended with a ratio of 19 to 3. Liangjiang won the applause of the audience. The second half began and the situation gradually tightened. Liangjiang's Long passed the ball to Shao and Shao shot remotely, which was actually successful. The two vanguards of Yayoi, Shinsei and Ise, shouted and the entire army tried their best to counterattack and won a lot of balls. Unfortunately, Long, the center of Liangjiang, slipped and his legs were broken. Tu Yunsheng took over and the two sides scored each other. The third quarter was 8 to 9 and Yayoi had one more point, gradually reversing the decline. After the fourth quarter began, both sides worked harder. Shao scored a goal from a distance and Long scored two goals from the center. Yayoi's Ise also showed his skills and scored one point for the penalty and four points. But he was still one point short and the whole game ended. The referee announced the end and Liangjiang won with a score of 33 to 17.</p>
<p>Looking at the strength of both sides, the players of Liangjiang have superb skills, good coordination, and rich experience. This is the main reason for the victory. Yayoi's entire army lacks strength and personal ball skills are also under Liangjiang's. It is natural for them to be defeated miserably. However, their spirit of always being one is also commendable.</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. Shinmei The Shinmei Women's High School basketball team, the most famous in Dalian, met Liangjiang's ever-victorious army in one game at 5:00 pm on the 28th. The intensity of the battle is self-evident. General fans rushed to enter the venue, which was more crowded than yesterday. This time, the Liangjiang team was the last battle of the expedition. Although some players felt mentally exhausted, in order to maintain the glory of consecutive victories, they fought to the death. Shinmei wanted to respect the reputation of the winning team, so they responded with all their strength. Therefore, the courage of the two teams in engaging in battle cannot be described in writing. The referees, Kuroda and Tajima, had Liangjiang smooth sailing in the first half. The ball often hovered between the three players Shao, Yang and Long. Even if they occasionally lost the opportunity, they still scored more goals. The passing of the Shinmei team was not good. One ball was often not sent out immediately and was taken away by Liangjiang. The first half was 12 to 5 and Shinmei was already dwarfed. In the second half, Shinmei replaced the cadres and agreed on a strategy to proceed in unison, which greatly improved. Zhuang and Wang, the two generals in the rear of Liangjiang, also showed their front and rear coordination skills. One was desperately fighting to the death and the other was skillfully trying their skills. The third and fourth quarters were 4 to 4 and 3 to 3, both tied. As a result, the victory of 19 to 12 eventually belonged to the Liangjiang team. (Reporter's Postscript) This time, the Liangjiang team traveled eastward and the reporter followed the team to investigate the Japanese newspaper industry and all new developments. I deeply feel that all facilities are in good order. The so-called material civilization and scientific omnipotence, Japan is indeed worthy of it. Detailed records will be taught to readers after sorting them out. First, I will briefly describe Japanese sports. It seems that most Japanese citizens understand the true meaning of the word sports. Not only do schools advocate physical education to train students' strong bodies, but also people from all walks of life have a deep understanding of this. Almost all of the time outside of their daily duties is spent on the sports field. All kinds of ball games, track and field competitions, and swimming are available for everyone to practice. The government encourages it and the society advocates it. As a result, there is a universal phenomenon today. Seeing that the bodies of Japanese citizens, regardless of men, women, old and young, are far stronger than those of our country, the future development of their nation cannot be limited. Although the Liangjiang team has won many victories in this eastward expedition, it is only that their ball skills have improved. Comparing the physical strength and perseverance, it is really not enough. I deeply hope that the sports circles in our country will wake up and reflect.</p>

<p>— Xiaodie</p>
<p>I, Xiaodie, have often visited the eighteen flower docks of Liuxia Wujian. This spring, Monk Xingyuan of Xiaohe Mountain invited me to stay at Jinlian Temple. Those joining us were Mu Huai and Yu Kun. Xiaohe Mountain is eighteen miles from Liuxia, with secluded streams and valleys. The bamboo paths and stone steps are spotless. Further in are the Yucen and Tongwu areas of the Wu Dynasty, considered the most beautiful parts of Liuxia Wujian. However, it rained that day, and we heard there were tigers in Tongwu, so we couldn't explore everything. In the fourth lunar month, Yu Kun returned to Dongyue. I followed Mu Huai to stay at Xixi. That night, the moonlight was very bright. We walked by moonlight from Xixi Bridge, past Daxiaolongju Dock, to Dongyue, only about seven miles. The mountain flowers had already faded, and early fireflies flickered in the grass like solitary stars. Late bamboo shoots pushed through the stones, sometimes hindering our feet, while the murmuring streams were always beside us, though unseen. Yu Kun loved to sing, and he sat barefoot on the stone bridge with two or three good friends, singing in the clear moonlight. Hearing footsteps, they abruptly stopped, and called out to each other with laughter through the bamboo fence, the moonlight shadows completely shattered. Yu Kun said, "Why not take advantage of the moonlight to climb to the top of North Peak and chant?" But Mu Huai declined, saying his feet were tired, and thought it better to save that enjoyment for tomorrow, when we would climb Shiren Ridge and return to West Lake via Tianzhu. I gazed at North Peak, the misty moonlight vague and indistinct, imagining tomorrow's journey. That night, I was so excited I couldn't sleep. On the ninth day, three bamboo sedan chairs set off from Liuxia, going south along Xixi. Gradually, we entered a bamboo path. Two peaks, like snail shells, stood proudly outside the bamboo forest, called Jinzhu Ridge. The foot of the ridge was somewhat winding, with bamboo forests rising high, while above and below were the east and west Mu Docks, secluded and beautiful, still retaining the charm of the flower docks. After passing Jinzhu Ridge, the stone steps became steeper, and the mountain scenery also changed. The lush green beauty was mixed with majestic and rugged features. Were these the clouds of heaven, or the stones of the mountain? Shaking my clothes, I felt like I wanted to fly away on the wind. A hundred layers of emerald screens stood upright in front, seemingly hundreds of feet high. The wind blew the leaves, making rustling sounds, like a qin or a zither, with a lingering melody, unlike any worldly sound. Mu Huai said, "Behind the mountain is Shiren Ridge, where West Lake can be seen like an inkstone pond. The mountains above the lake are not without beauty, just like officials who carefully groom their appearance, while only the peaks of Liuxia are unadorned and unpretentious. For hundreds of years, they have been rarely visited and seldom praised, so their natural purity has not been carved. It's a shame." He continued, "Mountains are like people. Those who are famous lose their purity. We have found this secluded secret. Perhaps it's best not to tell outsiders." Now, the two of you are far away in northern Anhui, constantly thinking of our past travels, which are difficult to repeat. I have hastily written this record. Will Yu Kun and Mu Huai think I am being too talkative?</p>

<p>— Gengxin</p>
<p>Near Staro Gard Gdański, Poland, there is a small town with a long-abandoned distillery. A stork built its nest on top of it. The air was clear, which the stork enjoyed. Recently, workers climbed to the top to renovate the building and resume operations. This stork temporarily perched on a nearby lemon tree, but the new home was not to its liking. Soon, it returned to its old home. The next day, the workers came again, and the stork moved again. This happened back and forth for a week. Finally, the worker was defeated by the stork's patience, so he let it be. Today, this stork still lives atop the distillery's chimney, spending its life in swirling smoke. Its feathers have turned completely black, making it look almost like a huge crow from afar.</p>

<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The area around the Huangpu River is vast, with densely packed shops and markets. The so-called residential areas are also overflowing, making it difficult to find a place to live. In recent years, commerce has declined and unemployment is rampant. When these people were employed, they sometimes struggled to make ends meet. Once they are laid off, they have nothing to eat and wait anxiously. How can they survive? Some of the stronger ones turn to theft to get what they want, while the weaker ones beg for help to stay alive. Regardless of whether they are strong or weak, or whether they steal or beg, the cause is unemployment. If everyone could live and work in peace and have peace of mind, then social stability would be guaranteed. Look at Japan. At night, they can sleep soundly with only paper windows covering their doors. Why can't we be like them? It is truly regrettable. What I am about to describe is what I have personally witnessed. I will tell my friends about it. My friends say that Shanghai has such gangs. They don't necessarily have to be unemployed to do this. I think Shanghai is so big that there is nothing strange about it. I will describe it to readers as a precaution.</p>
<p>One day, I was visiting a friend and passed through Mongolia Road. A man, poorly dressed, was holding a glass bottle in his right hand and a piece of white paper. He was supporting his left leg with his left hand and walking with difficulty. However, he was not focused on walking and was looking around with his eyes, acting in a pretentious manner. I was curious and wanted to see what was going on, so I followed him. When we arrived near the vegetable market, a man, who looked to be about fifty years old and who seemed to be visiting Shanghai from the countryside for the first time, came towards us. While he was looking around, the first man suddenly bumped into him, and the glass bottle shattered with a crash. The second man was startled by the sudden sound, and the first man grabbed his collar, crying out, "I came from the hospital. The medicine in the glass bottle was just bought from the pharmacy. I have a doctor's prescription here." As he spoke, he took out the white paper from his right hand and showed it to the second man. He continued to cry, "I am a laborer. I only earn three or four dimes a day. It was really difficult for me to spend a dollar to buy this medicine." The second man argued that he didn't bump into him, but the first man said, "Is there any reason to intentionally bump into someone holding a glass bottle of medicine to make it break?" The two men argued for a long time. A bystander, acting as a peacemaker, said, "Just pay him four dimes to settle the matter." The second man reluctantly took out the money and gave it to the first man, who then left angrily. Looking at the white paper he had thrown away, it was an old prescription, and the medicine in the bottle was obviously tap water.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, I was walking from my residence and passed Baoshan Road. A child was walking ahead of me, carrying a lacquered bucket slowly, as if expecting something. I was about fifty paces away from him when a flashy rickshaw suddenly came along at Yokohama Bridge. A young woman was sitting in the rickshaw with several books on her lap, probably a student at Patriotic or Yanzhe School. At this time, the child seemed to have reached his destination and rushed forward, colliding with the rickshaw puller. The bucket fell and the people fell. The red lacquer flowed all over the street. The child got up and cried, grabbing the rickshaw puller's clothes and crying, "This lacquer was entrusted to me by my master to deliver to a certain place. It cost more than two dollars. Pay me quickly, pay me quickly." He continued to cry. Many people gathered around to watch, and everyone thought that because he was young, he must not be lying. Finally, the young woman took out a dollar and waved him away. The so-called lacquer was just a bucket of red mud. The child was probably an expert in this field.</p>

<p>Mr. Feng Chaoran of Wujin is famous throughout the country and is currently known as Gu Lu. He uses the pseudonym Songshan Jushi and named his studio Songshan Thatched Cottage. His students are numerous and talented. Recently, to connect friendships and hone their artistic skills, they organized the first elegant gathering of the Songshan Thatched Cottage Painting Collection on the Buddha's Birthday in the fourth lunar month at the residence of Mr. Wang Boyuan in West Shanghai. Around 3:00 p.m., more than twenty teachers and students took a group photo. The host also brought out rare ancient and modern masterpieces to share with the guests. While admiring them, Mr. Chaoran gave earnest instructions, truly a great teacher of his time. In the evening, the students gathered for a banquet to celebrate Mr. Chaoran's birthday. Mr. Chaoran looked at them and was happy. During the banquet, guest Mr. Mu Ouchu gave a congratulatory speech, and the host performed magic tricks to entertain the guests. The students who attended that day were Sun Qionghua, Zhou Shujuan, Zhang Yanhua, Zheng Qihua, Mao Guihua, Shen Xiuhua, Xi Jinhua, Xie Yaohua, Yu Yinghua, Li Dehua, Tang Hua and other ladies, as well as Xing Mingsheng, Zhang Gunian, Yuan Anpu, Cao Junjian, Zhang Yayong, Zheng Mukang, Lu Yanshao, Cheng Xiaoguang, Wu Digang and other gentlemen. Guests included Mr. Mu Ouchu, Wu Hufan, Xie Shengzu, Zhu Qiting, Zhu Jingbo, Li Zunyong and other gentlemen. I am also a private student of Mr. Chaoran, so I was fortunate enough to participate in this grand gathering, and I am recording the magnificence of the moment.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Some Japanese Shinmura projects have also failed in trials. Bihai is a successful experimental farming village.</p>
<p>On April 18th, I took a train from Tokyo to Anjo Prefecture. Shimo-Anjo is a town name belonging to the village of Hekikai-gun, Aichi Prefecture.</p>
<p>I got off the train in the faint morning light and had a meal. The landlady came out to greet the guests. An opportunity to talk had arrived. Hekikai is famous for its cooperative businesses. They call cooperation "Kumiai."</p>
<p>I asked, "Your Kumiai is very developed. The signboard says 'Japanese-Western Kumiai Dining Hall.' I guess it's also a Kumiai. What exactly is the meaning of Kumiai? What are the benefits of being a member?" She replied, "Being a member of the Kumiai means you can discuss things. You can participate in meetings. There are also very enjoyable group trips. Recently, we went to Tokyo to see the cherry blossoms. It only cost each person 1.50 yuan." I asked, "Are there any other benefits?" She took the dishes inside, stopped for a moment, and then came out and said, "Other restaurants can call geishas, but our dining hall is not allowed to call geishas. There are more than a hundred geishas in Anjo."</p>
<p>Numerous bicycles passed by outside the door, mostly female students, but also male students, aged between fourteen or fifteen and seventeen or eighteen.</p>
<p>I entered the Hekikai-gun Purchasing and Sales Kumiai Federation. Director Tsuruta came out to meet me and answered my questions in great detail. Their Kumiai stipulates four types: (1) Purchasing Kumiai, (2) Sales Kumiai, (3) Credit Kumiai (i.e., lending Kumiai), and (4) Utilization Kumiai, which is a method of using publicly equipped machinery.</p>
<p>The main items sold by their Sales Kumiai are food and eggs.</p>
<p>We then visited their agricultural association, town hall, agricultural supplementary school, agricultural and forestry school, poultry breeding and incubation Kumiai, Fukugama utilization factory, Aichi Prefecture Agricultural Experiment Station, and finally visited a farm owned by the Itakura family.</p>
<p>Looking at the town hall, the entire town's budget book was detailed, standardized, and explained meticulously and executed rigorously. From the lowest level, I could see their scientific spirit.</p>
<p>Entering the agricultural supplementary school, they recruit ordinary elementary school graduates for a three-year course. The male students take agricultural courses, and the female students take domestic science and sewing courses. After graduation, they serve in rural villages or homes. Countless bicycles were parked inside the door. I realized that the numerous students I had just seen cycling to the countryside were students from this school. I guessed that the families of the students in this school all had considerable wealth and could afford bicycles. I also guessed that the students in this school were scattered in various villages and the area was relatively large, so they needed bicycles. So I asked the principal, "Are the families of the students in your school all of middle-class wealth or above?" He replied, "Yes, agricultural laborers cannot afford to enter this school." I asked, "What do they do after graduation?" He replied, "Ninety-nine percent become agricultural managers, and only one percent become laborers." I asked, "What percentage of laborers in this town are property owners?" He replied, "Sixty percent are owner-farmers, twenty percent are tenant-farmers (i.e., those who farm on land owned by others), and twenty percent are owner-tenant-farmers." Looking at it this way, it can be considered good, but the education and economy of the rural villages have not yet reached the area of my ideals.</p>

<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>If one could concentrate one's mind and have it be the master, then wherever one thought, one could surely reach. That would be like a god. One must abandon one's physical body to be good. The Lao Mountain Taoist in the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was a person who had achieved spiritual liberation. When his disciple was on the mountain with him, his master would certainly put his physical body somewhere else and only use his spirit to instruct him. That is why he was able to pass through walls without hindrance. It was not using the method in "Goose Illusions Compiled," using loadstone to burn smoke and create a false wall. When his disciple ran home with his physical body, he could not leave his form and even tried to think of passing through walls with his physical body, and he broke his head. So I think the people of the future world will all be ghosts, ghosts talking to ghosts, or people who are close to ghosts talking to ghosts. They will surely be able to shake hands and talk heart-to-heart, just like humans in the present world. However, ghosts still have to die and become Jiang. Their level will advance further, seemingly like the golden shrimp becoming a tadpole. It is like sperm turning into a person, and tadpoles turning into mosquitoes. From human death to becoming a ghost, and mosquito death to transforming into what? Because humans' eyesight is limited, we only see the physical bodies of mosquitoes. How do we know that mosquito ghosts are not in another world, becoming mosquito Jiang? No one has ever talked about what Jiang die into. However, I say that the spirit is immortal and will surely exist forever in the world, for thousands of autumns and myriads of ages without perishing. Therefore, Confucius was able to dream of the Duke of Zhou. In reality, how was it a dream? How do we know that he was not clearly seeing the Jiang of the Duke of Zhou? If the people of the world could make their dream souls have a master, going east when they wanted to go east and going west when they wanted to go west, like Confucius dreaming of the Duke of Zhou, dreaming when he wanted to dream and seeing the Duke of Zhou when he wanted to see him, then Confucius would surely be extremely strong in spirit. After his decline, he did not have this ability, so he could not dream of the Duke of Zhou again. If Confucius had long abandoned his physical body and specialized in working with the Duke of Zhou in his dreams, he would not have aged. Why would he have troubled himself with a carriage and two horses on a dusty road? When he wanted to dream, he could dream; when he wanted to see him, he could see him. This shows that his dream soul was already able to be independent. If he abandoned his physical body, he would not need carriages and horses to travel to various countries. With a single thought, he would arrive at a certain place. It would also be very easy for him to practice his art of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. He would only need to use his telepathic powers to guide the minds of the people of the world, and they would be like the compass needles that have passed through magnetism, and they would definitely not have different directions. I say that even if the people of the future world graduate from telepathy specialized schools, if they do not abandon their physical bodies, I am afraid that it will not be thorough. My future world is the spiritual world, which is also the world of gods. Because there are no physical bodies, there is no pain. Isn't it as happy as a god? In the future, when you come to this future world, you will surely abandon your physical body, but your relatives will surely mistakenly think that you are dead and will inevitably cry a lot, causing you to secretly laugh.

<h3 id="e95">The Golden Market's Confusing Fluctuations <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>People's hearts are ever-changing and often fluctuate. Yesterday, June 1st, the gold market was extremely chaotic. Losses were taken as gains, with frequent swings of several taels. In total, there were fluctuations beyond ten taels. As a result, the price rose slightly by one tael overall. The mood was hesitant. From the early market, the price rose above 810 taels. Although the silver market rose the day before, it was not much. Afterwards, foreign exchange rates remained steady. However, selling pressure increased, eagerly anticipating a sharp drop of ten taels. Furthermore, the price became unpredictable due to the loosening of exchange bills. It was impossible to predict what would happen. The market was still two or three taels higher or lower. Finally, the price remained within 810 taels. However, the foreign exchange market was not very volatile, and trading was still slow.</p>
<p>The price rose sharply at the opening, and then declined. The opening price for July was 810 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 5 taels. The previous day's large transactions only increased by one-sixteenth. The market sentiment was bullish, and buyers were strong. The price then rose to 14 taels. However, Da De Cheng, Hong Li, Chun Yuan, Yong and others sold, and the price immediately decreased. In a short moment, there were gains and losses of two or three taels. As for the exchange bills, the bank initially offered British gold at 12.0625. After taking two pence, it offered 2.0625 again. Therefore, at around 9:20 a.m., the price fell to 0.91 taels and 1 mace. Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Heng and others bought in, and Shanghai bought British gold, raising the price to 12.5 taels. The price was announced not to move at around 11 taels. However, large investors sold heavily. Gan Chang Xiang, Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, and Yong released their holdings. Furthermore, Sumitomo, HSBC and other foreign banks sold at 12.5, and the market situation suddenly became weak, falling sharply. The price fell as much as 8 taels. However, there were occasional fluctuations of one or two taels. By 10 a.m., the price was 803 taels and 5 mace. Afterwards, Tong Tai Chang, Tian Feng, Yong, Zhi Feng, Yong and others came to buy, and the price rose slowly. In a short period of time, the price recovered by 8 taels. As for British gold, the trend also became more moderate, settling at 2.0625 pence to 2 pence. By 11 a.m., the price rose to 12 taels. However, sellers continued to sell, making it difficult to maintain the momentum. The market again showed signs of weakness. At 11:15 a.m., the price was 0.55 taels. Later, Yuan Mao Yong and Tian Feng Yong bought, raising the price by 4 taels. At 11 a.m., the price was 0.923 taels. Unexpectedly, goods and other items were sold. At 11:50 a.m., the price fell back to 0.58 taels. Again, zero-lot buyers raised the price to 0.878 taels near the closing. At noon, the price closed at 0.78 taels. It then fell again to slightly above 0.05 taels, due to the sale of goods by Da Lian Gang and others. The price was calculated at 853 taels and 8 mace, a deduction of 45 or 46 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was quiet, and the market situation was bleak. The afternoon market opened at 0.05 taels, followed by 0.045 taels, a lower opening for goods. Afterwards, small Indian exchange rate reports were released, and the price rose slightly, but only by one or two taels. The ins and outs of the various numbers were inconsistent, but there were no large transactions. At 2:30 p.m., a high-flying trend was seen, because Macaulay bought July British gold at 1.2125. Furthermore, Gan Chang Xiang and Yuan Mao Yong and the top firms successively purchased. In just a quarter of an hour, the price rose by more than six taels. At 2:45 p.m., the price was 811 taels. Afterwards, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Heng Yu and others sold, and at 3:00 p.m., the price was 0.68 taels. Da Xing Yong bought, and the price immediately rose by two taels to 0.09 taels. Again, due to the large Indian exchange rate report, at 3:30 p.m., the price fell to 0.06 taels. However, the exchange market remained steady and did not change. In the later hours, there were fluctuations of one tael. Until after 4:00 p.m., speculator Wu entered the market and Gan Chang Xiang and others scrambled to buy. Therefore, the price rose to 10 taels. In an instant, the price was suppressed to 0.07 taels, and then recovered to 0.095 taels. The state was adrift and there was no real grasp. At 4:30 p.m., the market closed at 808 taels and 5 mace. Compared to the previous Saturday, the price had risen by one tael. Afterwards, the price was raised to 0.09 taels, but Tong Tai Chang and others sold, and the price was then suppressed to 0.075 taels. According to the daily high price of 14 taels and the minimum price of 0.35 taels, there was a difference of 10 taels and 5 mace. The morning market for goods was 12 taels. The noon closing was 0.65 taels. The afternoon was 4 taels and 8 mace. The closing price was 8 taels and 5 mace. The revealed price was 50 taels or so. Afterwards, the price was 43 taels. As a result, the price was 45 or 46 taels. The listed price was 0.06 taels. The full price was 0.08 taels. The water compensation was 0.06 taels. The afternoon was 0.07 taels.</p>
<p>The transactions of the various firms were extremely inconsistent. The transaction statistics of the various firms were as follows: Yuan Mao Yong, Gan Chang Xiang, Hong Li and others all sold. Cui Chang, Yong Yuan, Kang Xiang, Heng Xing, Bing Xing, Tian Feng Yong, Yu, Da Tong and Tai Chang all bought. Wan Xing Heng Yu, Yuan Tai, Shun Li, Yuan Cheng and Xin Heng Zhi Feng Yong Da De Cheng had frequent ins and outs. Yuan Heng and Fu Chang had frequent ins and outs with exchange bill speculation. Speculator Wu entered the market slightly. In the afternoon, Gan Chang Xiang, Da Xing Yong, Bing Xing, Yuan Cheng and goods all bought. Shun Li Zhi Feng Yong Da De Cheng Wan Xing Heng Yu and Fu Tai Heng alternately bought and sold. Heng Xing Ju Chang and Tian Yu Yong Tong Tai Chang Yuan Kang Xiang and others all sold. Wu entered the market again. Da Lian Gang sold a total of 2,000 bars, while buying 1,000 bars. Guang Gang only accounted for more than 300 bars in transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Foreign Exchange Market's Fluctuations <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC foreign exchange rates, except for the French exchange rate which contracted by one yuan to 711 yuan, and Hong Kong increased by 25 to 80 taels and 0.075, the rest did not change. The slight increase in British silver the day before was not considered significant. The US silver market was closed due to the holiday. The current British exchange rate is 1 shilling and 1.75 pence, the US dollar is 27.875 yuan, and the Japanese silver is 1 tael, 7 mace and 7.25 fen. The price of the bank transaction was strong in the morning, then loosened at noon and returned to level in the afternoon. The trend of the price was high and then low. However, there were fluctuations of more than ten taels throughout the day, which made it unpredictable. As a result, compared to the previous Saturday, the price seemed to be weak. The British gold was up 0.0625, the US dollar was up 0.1875, and the Japanese silver was down slightly by one fen. The Chinese merchant transactions were still lively. The supply and demand were not constant, and the situation was complex. The British gold成交amounted to about 300,000 pounds, and most of the gold industry was hedging. There were few ins and outs of US exchange rates, and there was no wholesale number of Japanese silver. The market was almost in a fluctuating situation.</p>

<h3 id="e98">A Glimpse of the Idleness of Foreign Silk <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The weather is not good, and the silk production is not abundant.</p>
<p>According to previous years, at this time, the demand for silk for foreign countries was constant. The revitalization of the market was also a major event in the whole year. This year, due to the poor harvest of silk, foreign collectors are lazy to engage in it, resulting in a great market being desolate. According to Shanghai's various industries, this year's silkworm breeding in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is poor, and many of them have died. No one rents silk stoves. Therefore, the demand for foreign silk is not strong. Furthermore, the replacement of current silver by banknotes is also a major reason.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Securities and Public Bonds Rebound with Strong Momentum <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>20-Volume Bonds Rise to Limit, Remaining Orders Also Good at Several Yuan</p>
<p>Market Slightly Flat, Transaction Volume 16 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market saw various types of spot goods being traded, albeit in small quantities. Although the futures market continued to be active with buyers and sellers, due to the limitation of increased margin requirements, the market was slightly flatter than before. The July futures, in particular, requiring physical delivery, appeared even more subdued. As for the trend of bond prices, the market sentiment was better than before from the opening in the morning. Sellers were less eager, and buyers became quite active, so prices rebounded higher than before. The rebound remained strong in the second session, and the downward trend did not weaken, resulting in the 20-volume July futures reaching the limit price at the closing, with remaining orders suspended. The June futures also rose by 3.70 yuan compared to last week, and other bonds also rose by about 1 to 2 yuan. The market was quite optimistic for a time. However, the prices of many spot goods still fell significantly, which was due to the lack of recent transactions. The total transaction volume for the day was 32,000 yuan for spot goods and more than 16.3 million yuan for futures, with the July futures accounting for a very small portion. Furthermore, the Chinese Merchants Electric Stock suddenly opened at ten shares.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales to Sichuan Merchants Are Strongest <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which has been brewing for a long time, is gradually showing signs of life. This is mainly because the demand for current yarn in the northern region is unusually strong, and locally produced yarn accounts for the majority. This area used to be dominated by Japanese yarn, but now, due to unfavorable exchange rates, the price of yarn in Shanghai is relatively low, so there is a constant stream of purchases. The volume of yarn entering Sichuan is also strong, and the situation for other merchant groups is also improving. As a result, market sentiment is excited, and the market is rising. However, most sellers are bearish, because the coarse yarn market is stagnant and the overall situation is still unstable, so there are still those who short the market when it rises. However, comparing the overall situation, the market price in Shanghai is lower. The price of 20-count Palace Maid yarn in Qingdao and other places is 196 taels, and the price of 16-count Five Star yarn is 180 taels. Therefore, merchants from the northern routes are constantly trading and purchasing in Shanghai. If the business of various merchant groups can continue uninterrupted, the inventory can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, recently, many factories have switched to spinning finer yarn, so in the future, there may inevitably be a period of sharp price increases. However, the chaotic political situation is a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>Human Bids See Increases of One to Two Taels. At the exchange, the opening price for human bids in the morning market was higher due to good current sales and tight market conditions, with each bid rising by four, five, six, or seven cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that current yarn business was picking up in various regions, and some were rushing to cover short positions, with each bid rising by one tael, two, four, or five cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 36,600 bales. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,300 bales, Ruidai 1,200 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, and Yichang 1,450 bales. Dafeng bought 1,450 bales, Tianlong 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,750 bales, Yidai 1,500 bales, and Xiesheng 1,100 bales. The closing prices for human bids are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance | Month | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| June | 16.28 | Up 0.15 | 61,050 | September | 16.00 | Up 0.075 | 1,500 |</p>
<p>| July | 16.38 | Up 0.19 | 75,100 | October | 16.05 | Up 0.17 | 41,850 |</p>
<p>| August | 16.38 | Up 0.20 | 5,300 | November | 16.08 | Up 0.12 |  |</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales are Brisk and Prices Rise. Current yarn sales are quite brisk. According to statistics, various merchant groups bought a total of 6,405 bales for the whole day, with 200 bales being purchased by fellow merchants. The market price rose by five cents to one tael. Out-of-town merchants imported 2,800 bales from Tianjin, 400 bales from Shantou, 1,250 bales from Sichuan, 650 bales from inland areas, 100 bales from northern regions, 700 bales from Guangdong, 100 bales from Changsha, 100 bales from Fujian, 200 bales from Qingdao, and 200 bales from miscellaneous regions. It is said that current sales on the 30th also amounted to 4,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Cotton Market is Unusually Tight <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose at noon, with tight market conditions. This is because the inventory in Hankou is depleted, the source is lacking, and exchange rates are difficult to sustain. Foreign cotton cannot be imported smoothly, so Japanese merchants are buying new cotton but not releasing it. Because the yarn market is relatively firm, the cotton market is rising.</p>
<p>Hankou Bids are Firm. At the exchange, the opening price for Hankou bids in the morning market was flat, with each bid rising by five cents to one cent. In the afternoon, the market situation was quite tight, with each month rising by three, four, or five cents. The total transaction volume was 71,300 piculs. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,800 piculs, Taixing 1,300 piculs, Xinheng 1,900 piculs, and Tongxing 1,700 piculs. Changfeng bought 4,000 piculs, Yongfeng 1,700 piculs, and Baoji 1,500 piculs. The closing prices for Hankou bids are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| June | 39.25 | Up 0.50 | 124,000 |</p>
<p>| July | 39.25 | Up 0.50 | 188,400 |</p>

<p>| October | 37.80 | Up 0.45 | 145,800 |</p>
<p>| November | 37.50 | Up 0.30 |  |</p>
<p>Slight Movement in Current Demand. There was slight movement in current cotton transactions. The source is estimated to be 100 bales of Yao flower and 70 bales of Tong flower.</p>
<p>| Type | Price | Source | Amount | Transaction Type |</p>

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the Xinzha rice market showed an upward trend. There were a large number of people visiting the market early in the morning, and buyers took advantage of this opportunity to add to their inventories. Thick japonica rice with fresh top-grade goods rose by 30 cents, and the sales of thin indica rice from Ningbo were active. The road for hair rice was also good, and the price increased by about 20 cents. The road for early rice in the local city and villages was extremely smooth, and the price also increased by several cents. Ocean Du tips and Yin glutinous rice were firm. Few ships arrived on the inside route, and few were loaded with customer tips, so the market rose. Production origin market shouted for tightness, so the price of various goods was difficult to weaken.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, there were slightly fewer merchant groups arriving in Shanghai from the South Shanghai area. There was a lack of connection for thin indica rice, and sporadic movements of about five or six hundred stones. The top-grade market price was firm, and the middle level shouted for an increase of 20 cents. Although japonica rice from Changshu, Wuxi, northern Jiangsu, and Suzhou and Tongzhou was received, the number was small. Local shop transactions were more active, so the trend was up two or three cents. Ocean Du tips each kept their original market price, and the port tips lacked goods and had no market change. Yin yuan had no glory. It is estimated that there were more than ten numbers of buckets of river undergrain from Changshu, Wuxi, Yixing, Tongli, Pinghu, Qingpu, and Liantang, opening a market of 1,600 to 1,700 dan.</p>

<p>Orders Will Soon Arrive in Force, Prices will Gradually Decrease</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer indica rice was sold smoothly in this street, and the market was lively. However, a new ship of foreign rice already pre-ordered, the Saigon rice number 12, had just arrived. The appetite in this street was also good, but because the orders were about to arrive in force, the cargo owners were very willing to sell quickly, so the market was flat and soft. Yesterday, Wanxing handled the sale of 20 packs of Deputy Number One Saigon rice at a price of 11.5 yuan. High-number one etc. have not yet been sold.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Flour Market Returned to Flatness in the Afternoon <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market was quite excited in each month at the beginning, because the price of foreign wheat was only two or three cents lower. However, the weather was bad and there were thunderstorms, so the highest price in this month and July reached 1 tael, 1 cent, and 5.5 mills. Then, as the weather cleared up, many bulls from the inland merchants took the opportunity to come back, so the market returned to softness. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was still stable at first, but then the trend was very flat because the buying interest was low, and the transactions in each market were sparse. The recent term was slightly softer than in the morning, and the distant term was still stable. November was the first time it was opened for bidding, and there were few transactions. The price once opened to 2 taels, 2 cents, and 0.25 mills in the afternoon, and the closing price was also slightly softer. As a result, this month was 2.5 mills higher than the previous day's closing price, July was 5 mills higher, August was 7 mills higher, September was 1 cent higher, October was 1.5 cents higher, and November was unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Wheat Market Initially Strong, Then Settled <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The market in the futures wheat market yesterday morning and afternoon showed a trend of first being strong and then settling. In the morning, because the weather was bad, the market sentiment was up, and the highest price in each month was better than the previous month by three, four, or five cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market turned flat and the weather cleared up, the inland market sentiment and merchants all turned flat and relaxed. The recent term was slightly lower than in the morning by one or two cents, and the distant term hovered. November was the first time it was opened for bidding, and the highest price in the morning was 4 taels, 3 cents, and 9 mills. In the afternoon, it gradually fell, falling about seven or eight cents from the highest price. The new wheat harvest is widespread in the south of the Yangtze River, and it will probably be fully harvested in about ten days, so the weather conditions thereafter are very important to the rise and fall of the market. As a result, this month was 2 cents higher than the previous day, July and August were 2 cents higher, September was 3 cents higher, and October was 2 cents higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were still no telegrams from the sugar market's production area. The buying interest in the exchange market was still strong, and market prices all rose gradually. The transaction price for Dutch sugar number 24 coarse sand white reached 11 taels and 5 cents, with more than ten bags traded, rising one cent from the previous transaction, and the trend remained strong. Middle sand white etc. were all shouted higher, but the demand was very scarce, so there were no transactions. The Japanese sugar market was also high. Z: 11 taels and 4 cents; YT: 11 taels, 3 cents, and 7.5 mills; YRO: 10 taels and 1 cent; YP: 11 taels and 8 cents; Minghua goods: 11 taels and 7.5 cents; TN: 11 taels, 2 cents, and 7.5 mills; SN: 11 taels, 1 cent, and 7.5 mills; J: 11 taels and 8 cents; Taikoo HM: 11 taels to 1 cent.

Less than ten cocoon businesses opened for weighing, and the amount received by each business in the ten-plus days of weighing was 70% less than in previous years, and the quality of the cocoons was poor. The cocoon market ended, and the cocoon businesses have all stopped weighing. The highest cocoon price was 54-55 yuan, the lowest was 41-42 yuan, and the average was 46 yuan. The cocoon type received by each business this year was all of the zero-baking nature. Only four silk merchants rented factories and weighed cocoons.</p>

<p>Hoping that the Guangdong Incident Can be Turned from Danger to Safety</p>
<p>This reporter met with Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng at Wanglu yesterday and asked him when he would return to Beijing and how far the negotiations on the peaceful resolution of the Guangdong Incident had progressed. Wu said that he had originally planned to return to Beijing as soon as possible, but because he had been away from Shanghai for a long time last time, there were still many private matters to be dealt with, and he could also take this opportunity to rest for a few days. As for the Guangdong Incident, we always hope to turn danger into safety and avoid another war. Although Mr. Zhang Puquan has been sent to Guangdong by the Central Government to negotiate, the results are still unknown. It is said that Mr. Zhang has now left Guangdong and is returning north. I will wait for Mr. Zhang to arrive in Shanghai before returning to Beijing together.</p>
<p>China-Germany Radio</p>
<h3 id="e114">Officially Announced Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>400 Free Reports Issued</p>
<p>China-Japan Communication Awaits Ministry Order</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications has achieved good results since the commencement of the China-Germany trial telegraph. Therefore, it was specially announced yesterday that the China-Germany telegraph has been officially opened. Four hundred free tickets were pre-printed for Chinese and foreign merchants to collect as a souvenir. The following is a record of the information obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Demand for Free Reports Exceeds Supply: The radio station specially prepared 400 free report tickets as a souvenir for the official opening of the China-Germany telegraph and to promote it widely. These tickets were freely available to Chinese and foreign merchants for one day of free telegram transmission. As of 11:00 AM yesterday, all the tickets had been claimed. Those who arrived later continued to arrive in an endless stream. The format of the ticket is recorded below. The ticket is white with blue characters, with both Chinese and English versions. The top of the ticket is printed with the words "Ministry of Communications International Radio Station Free Report Ticket." Below it is divided into: (1) No fee will be charged for sending reports with this ticket; (2) The number of words is limited to 25; (3) The destination is all parts of Germany; (4) Valid until June 1, 20; (5) Receiving location: Sassoon Building, 1 Renji Road.</p>
<p>Telegram Types, Number of Words, and Prices: Telegrams sent from China to all parts of Germany are divided into three types. The first is express telegram, which costs 3.45 yuan per word and can reach its destination in about 20 minutes. The second is slow telegram, which costs 1.13 yuan per word and can reach its destination in about 1 hour. The third is daily news telegram, which costs 1.15 yuan per word, but is limited to a minimum of 25 words and will reach its destination in 48 hours.</p>
<p>No More Free China-France Communications: China and France have already officially opened telegraph communications, and the results are very good, but there has been no free opening. The station intends to officially conduct a free day as a promotion. The above information was sent to the French radio station to solicit opinions (according to the free regulations, both parties must agree; otherwise, our side will not charge a fee, but the other side will still charge a fee). Later, the French side replied that the radio station had already been free for one day during the China-France trial telegraph in mid-December last year. Therefore, there will be no more free China-France communications.</p>
<p>China-Japan Communication Has Not Received Ministry Order: According to a staff member of the radio station speaking to a reporter from the Far East News Agency, the unofficial China-Japan telegraph communication has already begun. It was originally intended to hold the official China-Japan telegraph communication at the same time as the China-Germany telegraph today (i.e., yesterday). However, because the Ministry of Communications has not yet issued an order for the official China-Japan telegraph communication, it cannot be realized within the next few days. It will be necessary to wait for the Ministry order to arrive before a date can be set.</p>

<p>Those who greeted him included Mr. An Lide, the U.S. Commercial Counselor in China, and others. U.S. Senator Pittman is taking the President Jefferson via Japan to Shanghai and may arrive this morning as well. The entire congressional delegation is scheduled to enter Beijing in mid-month and depart Shanghai for home on the 18th of this month. Mr. An Lide is scheduled to host the congressional delegation at the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office at 3 Guangdong Road at 4:00 PM this afternoon and invite Chinese and foreign bankers to meet and talk.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Mr. Robinson (Photo by Qiao Shanfu) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Delegation Members and Itinerary: The congressional delegation that departed from the United States to China this time consists of five people in total. Senator Oddie, the Republican representative from Nevada, is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel. Senator Robinson, the Democratic representative from Arkansas, is staying at the residence of U.S. Consul General Cunningham. Congressman Doughton, the Republican representative from Iowa, is</p>

<p>Staying at the residence of U.S. Assessor Bandi. Congressman Gisborn, the Republican representative from Vermont, is staying at the Cathay Hotel. Senator Pittman, who is arriving in Shanghai this morning, is the Democratic representative from Nevada. Nevada is a famous silver-producing region in the United States.

Both of them have proposed bills in the U.S. Senate to rescue silver prices and</p>

<p>Supported the Chinese silver loan matter, making their names widely known. Regarding the itinerary of the congressional delegation, Messrs. Oddie and Pittman will stay in Shanghai temporarily, while Messrs. Robinson, Doughton, and Gisborn are scheduled to take the Nagasaki Maru to Japan tomorrow and stay there for a week. The congressional delegation will return to Shanghai on the 12th of this month and then jointly enter Beijing on a scheduled date. They will depart Shanghai on the Tingte Shenghao transport ship on the 18th of this month and return to their home country via Manila.</p>
<p>Important Tasks in China: This reporter specially visited Mr. Oddie at the Cathay Hotel yesterday to discuss the silver price issue. Mr. Oddie declared that they are scheduled to stay in China for eighteen days on this trip, and their only task is to investigate and study the silver issue and do not intend to make any suggestions for the time being. They have established a temporary office in the Cathay Hotel and invited Chinese and foreign bankers to exchange opinions. The purchasing power of hundreds of millions of people in the East has been greatly affected due to the disastrous fall in silver prices, causing a decline in world commerce. Therefore, in order to restore the original prosperity of world commerce, it is necessary to catch up quickly and fix the silver price. He and Mr. Pittman are indeed representatives of the silver-producing region, but the countries that supply silver to the world include Mexico and England and France, and Nevada in the United States is only a small part of it. His secondary mission for this trip is to rescue the silver mines in Nevada. The recovery of silver prices depends on the cooperation of the countries concerned. It may be beneficial to convene an international silver conference and work together. The reporter then asked whether the United States was willing to be the initiator of the conference. Mr. Oddie replied that he doubted it very much. As for the silver loan issue, which was once very noisy, it is now silent. Whether the congressional delegation will raise the old issue again this time has not been discussed by both parties.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Yat Sen Warship Held a Flag-Raising Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Returning to the Fleet in One Week</p>
<p>The newly completed Yat Sen warship of the Navy held a flag-raising and oath-taking ceremony at Gaochang Temple Wharf yesterday. Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, presided over the ceremony. At 10:00 AM, the ceremony was conducted as scheduled. Captain Chen Hongtai took the oath and raised the flag. Chen Jiliang then presented the seal and delivered a speech, the gist of which was that the Chinese Navy had not completed a single warship in decades. Now, the Ministry of Navy had completed five warships amidst very difficult economic circumstances, the Yat Sen being one of them. Although our naval strength cannot be compared to that of Europe and America, the strength of naval power does not depend on the size of the warships but on the efforts and good training of the personnel. During the outbreak of the European War, the German warship Emden had a displacement of only 3,000 tons, not much different from our Yat Sen, but its power and its exploits are well known to everyone. Although it was eventually sunk, its great achievements remain among the Germans to this day. Therefore, in the future, everyone must strive for strength in terms of knowledge, academics, and training, and not judge naval strength solely based on the size of the warships. The ceremony ended at noon, and the warship is currently docked in Shanghai harbor and will sail to the capital to rejoin the fleet in a week.</p>

The materials for this special issue are jointly compiled by the City Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Anti-Opium Association. The content focuses on drug situation investigations and the actual situation of opium suppression. It is also learned that the preparatory committee has sent propaganda outlines, oath forms, slogans, etc., to party departments, agencies, and schools in various districts to hold separate commemorations. Those who need them can send a letter to the China National Anti-Opium Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road. The association believes that the relationship between opium suppression and the police is extremely close, and has sent a separate letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting that the propaganda materials sent by the association be distributed to each district, ordering the police in each district to swear to resist drugs and requesting the director of the bureau to report on the state of opium suppression in Shanghai over the past year at the June 3rd conference. The China National Anti-Opium Association, in order to promote opium cessation, will, during the June 3rd period, introduce opium addicts who register with the association to appropriate hospitals for free or reduced-fee opium cessation. It has also been found that the Anti-Opium Association has formulated memorial measures for the June 3rd Memorial and distributed them to anti-drug organizations across the country, which are recorded as follows: (1) Memorial Conference: On this day, anti-drug organizations should jointly hold a memorial conference with local party and government agencies, public organizations, and schools in public places, read Lin Zexu's will against drugs, report on the main points of the memorial, and invite celebrities to speak on Lin Zexu's history of drug suppression.

<p>A Matter of Changing the Yangjingbang Regulations</p>
<p>Taxpayers Ask the Government to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association has telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang Rutang and Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun on the 28th of last month regarding the matter of adding two or three Chinese members to the Land Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Public Concession. The telegram reads: "To His Excellency Wang Rutang, Foreign Minister of the Nanjing National Government, and His Excellency Zhang Yuejun, Mayor of Shanghai: The association believes that the Land Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Public Concession has only three foreign members and no Chinese members. There are often differences and feelings of unfairness in land valuation and public collection. In order to seek fair treatment, the council has sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting that two or three Chinese be added as members of the committee. The council replied that after considering the proposal to appoint two or three Chinese as members of the Land Committee, the board's proposition can only conform to what is stipulated in Article 6 of the Land Regulations. If it is desired to increase the number of land committee members, it is necessary to amend the Land Regulations, and the amendment of the Land Regulations must be negotiated by various countries and the Chinese government. The council believes that no changes should be made until the full report of Judge Fetham is completed. Upon investigation, the establishment of the Land Committee's members is indeed stipulated in the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, and the addition of Chinese members would be a change to these regulations. As for the council's statement that no changes should be made until the full report of Judge Fetham is completed, regardless of whether this is a form of procrastination, the applicability of Judge Fetham's report is still in question. The association believes that the addition of Chinese directors to the Municipal Council is also a change to the Land Regulations, which can only be achieved through negotiations between our government and the countries involved. The association believes that before the concession is taken back, it should be requested that Your Excellency promptly negotiate to add two or three Chinese members to the Land Committee of the Municipal Council. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, bow in respect."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Reorganization of the Overseas Chinese Federation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government Dispatches Fang Zizhen, Chen Chunan, and Qiu Wenshao to be Responsible</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission presented to the Central Government last year that the Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China was implying the name of the Commission and requested the Central Government to dissolve it. After learning the situation, the Central Government ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to execute it. It is now learned that the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has already presented to the Central Government and approved the dispatch of Fang Zizhen, Chen Chunan, Qiu Wenshao, and others to Shanghai to reorganize the Overseas Chinese Federation. The reporter of the Guowen News Agency learned the following news from various parties yesterday:</p>
<p>History of the Overseas Chinese Federation: The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China was established on January 26th of the first year of the Republic (1912). At that time, President Sun instructed the Minister of Interior to approve the registration and issue a bronze seal, gathering the strength of overseas Chinese to provide military supplies. The association's contribution to the anti-Yuan campaign was very significant. After its establishment, it fought against the enemy party on the one hand and provided support for overseas Chinese on the other hand, such as striving for overseas Chinese political rights, negotiating the Hong Kong and Singapore maritime defense zones, the ports' life and health tragedies, and recently working to abolish unequal treaties, protesting the harsh taxes in the Dutch East Indies, requesting the maintenance of domestic and foreign postal bureaus, requesting a reduction in overseas Chinese remittance fees, opposing the movement, and requesting amendments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' passport law, etc. Overseas Chinese have indeed benefited greatly. Last year, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission suddenly claimed that the name of the Overseas Chinese Federation was the same and received accusations from unknown persons that it was defrauding people, so it presented a request to the Central Government to dissolve it.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Reorganize: After learning the situation, the Central Government repeatedly investigated whether the Overseas Chinese Federation was implying a name and defrauding people, and ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to thoroughly investigate. The Overseas Chinese Federation published an advertisement to find the accuser, but it is said that no evidence has been obtained to date. Xu Jigong, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, expressed passivity due to the recurrence of old illnesses. Standing Committee members Lin Youwang and others went to Beijing several times to request a thorough investigation and request the dispatch of personnel to take over. It is now learned that the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has dispatched Fang Zizhen, Qiu Wenshao, Chen Chunan, and others as reorganizers, who have already arrived in Shanghai. Chen and Qiu are both members of the Overseas Chinese Federation.</p>
<p>Fang Zizhen's Speech: Yesterday, the reporter visited Fang Zizhen and Qiu Wenshao at their residence. According to their conversation, the past and present work of the Overseas Chinese Federation has indeed been an organization to fight for the interests of overseas Chinese. The Central Government's instruction to dissolve the association has made overseas Chinese extremely shocked, and we must strive to ensure that the group created by Sun Yat-sen is not dissolved at will. Now the Central Government has decided to reorganize it. The reporter also asked Fang and others about the reorganization measures, but they replied that they had not yet drafted specific measures.</p>
<p>Xu Jigong's Speech: The reporter then went to the residence of Xu Jigong, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation. According to his conversation, he has been exhausted by handling social public undertakings in recent years, and his foot disease has recurred. Whether the Overseas Chinese Federation is reorganized or dissolved, all members of the association deeply hope that the Central Government can resolve the accusations against the association as soon as possible. Mr. Jigong personally prays for this.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Director of the National Labor Bureau Assumed Office Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>After Chen Zongcheng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, took leave to go to Geneva, Switzerland with his wife to recuperate, Wang Renlin, Dean of the Law School of Jinan University, was hired to act as his replacement. Mr. Wang arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday (1st) to take over his duties, and immediately summoned all staff members to speak. No ceremony was held. Mr. Wang is still concurrently serving as Dean of the Law School. It is said that Mr. Chen's trip will require him to return to his original position after his leave expires next spring.</p>
<p>Export Goods</p>
<h3 id="e132">Generally Collect According to the New Tariff <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Old Contracts Cannot Be Changed</p>
<p>The new export tariff came into effect yesterday. Various export industries in this city had signed contracts for exports after June 1 before the announcement of the new export tariff, and they wanted to register with the customs and still collect according to the old tariff. They inquired with Jianghai Customs and learned that the Ministry of Finance had received a telegram from the Tianjin China International Trade Chamber of Commerce requesting adoption, but the ministry replied that the export tariff has now been promulgated by clear order and is stipulated to take effect from June 1, giving a considerable period of hesitation. All domestic goods shipped overseas from June 1 should be collected according to the new export tariff to comply with the law. The request to allow merchants to register with the customs and collect according to the old tariff is difficult to approve, the telegram replied. The city will also handle the matter in the same way.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Coal Transportation Dispute on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>A Conversation with Railway Officials</p>
<p>Coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway had sent representatives to the Ministry of Railways to request exemption from the 20% increase in coal transportation prices ordered by the Central Government, but they did not achieve their goal and went on strike on May 21. Recently, an important official of the railway passed through Shanghai and told visitors that this time, all railways across the country increased passenger and freight rates, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau also increased rates by 20% from May 1 in accordance with the ministry's order. For more than ten days since implementation, coal merchants in the Kunbo area suddenly went on strike. Previously, coal merchants in Kunbo, believing that the increase in freight rates was related to their business, had sent representatives to the railway bureau to request cancellation. The railway bureau replied that the price increase was not initiated by the railway bureau but was decided by the Executive Yuan of the Central Government and implemented by the Ministry of Railways. Therefore, it could not eliminate the price increase before receiving orders. The representatives believed that the increased burden was unacceptable. After repeated consultations, the railway bureau proposed a reconciliation plan, planning to reduce the price of domestic and export coal by 20% from June in the name of summer price reduction. The representatives replied to the coal merchants that the method was not thorough and still agreed to strike from May 21 for reasons of increased burden and unbearable losses. Since the Jiaoji Railway's coal freight rates were revised on November 1 of last year, the export freight rates have not been increased, and the domestic freight rates along the line have been reduced by a lot, some by as much as 40%. Now, although the price has increased by 20%, it is still lower than the old price except for a part of the export. The coal merchants' so-called losses do not seem to have a real basis. If it is said that the increase in export prices is significant, the railway bureau has also agreed to reduce the price uniformly for four months to reconcile it. Merchants can ship their contracted coal during this period. Instead, they agreed to strike, which is very harmful to the coal industry itself and the people's livelihood in Shandong Province, and is not adopted by informed people.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Measures for Collecting Export Tax on Yarn Market <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Federation previously stated that in Category 4, Item 195 of the export tariff promulgated by the Central Government, cotton yarn is taxed at $1.12 per picul, and in Item 195-2, cotton cloth is taxed at $1.15 per picul. They did not know whether this tax refers to trade from this port to another within the country or exports overseas. If it is said to be exports overseas, the consolidated tax on exported yarn and cloth is refunded in full to encourage exports. The export tax should be exempted. If it is said to be from this port to another within the country, according to the cotton yarn consolidated tax regulations, yarn and cloth that have completed the consolidated tax are exempt from all other taxes, which is inconsistent. They sent a letter to the Consolidated Tax Office for explanation. The association received a reply from the Consolidated Tax Office yesterday stating that the matter had been consulted with Director Zhang of the Customs Office, who replied that the collection or exemption of customs duties on cotton yarn and cotton cloth declared for export overseas is still handled in accordance with the old regulations. As for the domestic transport from this port to another, if it is transported to an area that has implemented the consolidated tax, the export customs duty should be exempted. However, if it is transported to an area that has not implemented the consolidated tax, the export customs duty must still be collected in accordance with the old regulations. The corresponding letter is replied to so that all customs offices can be informed.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Tobacco Industry Requests a Reduction in Export Tax <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a document to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry stating: "On the 29th of this month, the Tobacco Industry Association of this city sent a letter stating that they had read the newly promulgated and amended export tariff of the National Government, which taxes tobacco at 7.5% of its value, requiring a tax of 1 tael and 7 mace per picul. The import tax on tobacco has caused a major blow to the domestic tobacco industry, and the export quantity has decreased sharply. If China's export tax is increased by more than ten times, domestic tobacco will not be able to be sold abroad, and the national economy and people's livelihood will be harmed. How can this be in line with the National Government's intention to promote domestic goods and develop foreign trade? The association feels deeply affected and has witnessed the decline in sales of domestic tobacco abroad in recent years. Therefore, we sincerely request your association to promptly forward the matter to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and request that the tax rate for tobacco in the newly promulgated and amended export tariff be appropriately reduced. Upon investigation by the association, the increase from 1 mace and 5 fen to 1 tael and 7 mace this time is a unique increase. In recent years, countries such as Egypt have repeatedly increased heavy taxes on tobacco exported from our country, which has been reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation. If the domestic export tax is increased by more than ten times, the industry's domestic and foreign transportation will inevitably not be able to sustain itself. Moreover, companies such as British American Tobacco Company have repeatedly encouraged people in provinces such as Shandong and Henan to plant tobacco and sell the remaining raw materials from tobacco factories for export, which is of some benefit to people's livelihoods. This is different from the situation of cotton, which is necessary for yarn and cloth and should be heavily taxed to reduce exports. The association's request for an appropriate reduction is for the purpose of alleviating commercial difficulties. It is reasonable to present this telegram for your review and approval. It is truly for the public good. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows in respect."</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Cotton Cloth Industry Firmly Refuses to Pay Dockage Fees on Behalf of Customers <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>A Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce States the Reasons</p>
<p>The cotton cloth customs declaration industry has been in a dispute over the payment of dockage fees on behalf of customers. After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a high-profile mediation between the three parties, there was still no concrete solution. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association yesterday stated its reasons to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for not being able to pay on behalf of customers, saying: "Respectfully, regarding the dockage fee case, the responsibility for payment has been admitted by the customer representatives on the spot, so there is naturally no problem. The only unresolved dispute is which party should pay on behalf of the customers. After careful consideration by this association, we are unable to agree. We respectfully submit this to your association. The dockage fee must be paid when the goods are exported, and customs practice has always been to collect it from the customs declaration firm that undertakes the shipment. Therefore, in terms of facts and procedures, it is indispensable for the customs declaration industry to pay on behalf of customers. For our industry, we want to pay on behalf of customers but cannot. Therefore, it is only reasonable that this obligation should be carried out by the customs declaration industry on behalf of customers. However, the customer representatives expressed a rather strong intention on that day to force our industry to undertake the task, abandoning the direct path and taking a roundabout route. The true motive is self-evident. If it is as they say, the following reversals will inevitably occur: (1) After the customs declaration industry pays the customs on behalf of the customers, they do not directly seek compensation from the customers but indirectly collect it from our industry. (2) The customers who bear the responsibility for payment do not directly hand over the payment to the customs declaration firm that has already paid on their behalf but indirectly hand it over to our industry, which has no connection. (3) Our industry first collects from the customers and then pays to the customs declaration firm. We are originally a completely unrelated third party, but we must be forced to assume the obligation of intermediate transfer. (4) Many customers operate their own customs declaration firms. They do not compensate their own firms but hand over the payment to other firms, blaming others instead of themselves. Nothing in the world is more ridiculous than this. Moreover, our industry has an upstream and downstream relationship with the customers. If it were not absolutely necessary, why would we be willing to damage the relationship? For example, although the Social Affairs Bureau has announced that each customer should attach an additional 3 mace and 4 fen of silver to the consolidated tax to be handed over to our industry for collection and settlement, even though it has been more than a month now, our industry has still been unable to collect it from the customers as required. However, we cannot but pay the customs declaration workers in full. The previous example can serve as a warning, and we fear repeating the same mistake. After our industry has declined, we can no longer afford to increase the burden. Therefore, we express our difficulties and sincerely request your association to examine and verify the facts, uphold justice, and resolve the matter fairly. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Uniform Price for Kerosene for Both Chinese and Foreign Businesses <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways sent a letter to the municipal government yesterday regarding equal treatment in kerosene transportation prices for Chinese and foreign businesses. It reads: "Respectfully, after reviewing the minutes of the National Commercial Transport Conference previously convened by this Ministry, and with reference to the proposal submitted by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the Shanghai Guanghua Kerosene Company and the Sino-American Kerosene Company, requesting that they receive the same preferential transportation rate of 70% as the Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum Companies, a resolution was passed that all companies, Chinese or foreign, should receive equal treatment. This decision was duly recorded by the Ministry and communicated to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations for compliance. It has now been reported that the current freight car transportation regulations of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway stipulate that the special price for transporting kerosene is calculated by deducting 50% from the second-class freight rate, but this is only applicable to full carloads and only for northbound shipments. The current freight car transportation regulations of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway stipulate that kerosene transported in tank cars, boxed drums, or cans is charged at a rate that deducts 55% from the second-class full carload freight rate, regardless of whether the company or business is Chinese or foreign. There is no discrepancy in these special kerosene rates on the two lines. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's statement that the Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum Companies are charged at a rate of 70% is not accurate. We are informing your esteemed government accordingly for dissemination to avoid any misunderstanding."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Gu Case Support Association's Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>To Handle the Qu Case and the Incident Involving American Sailors at Qichang Wharf Concurrently</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Support Gu Jingen Association's first executive committee meeting resolved to send Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Xuefan, and others to Beijing to petition the government. Recently, the association sent representatives, including Zhu Xuefan, to meet with Mr. Wang at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the petition to Beijing. Mr. Wang immediately asked Zheng Chengqing to meet on his behalf and replied that while he felt obligated to assist in the Gu case, his various responsibilities made it difficult for him to go to Beijing as a representative. Mr. Zhu then requested Mr. Zheng to convey that since Mr. Wang was unable to go to Beijing, another representative could be appointed to assist. Mr. Zheng agreed to convey this message to the association. Regarding the recent incidents of American sailors injuring and killing Chinese, it was decided that on the 2nd (today), Zhu Xuefan, Wang Yongchang, and others would go to the Anhui Provincial Association to discuss aid for the Qu case, as well as the case of American sailors from the US ship at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong injuring four coolies and policemen. The second executive committee regular meeting will be held on the 4th of this month at 2:00 PM to discuss and consider assistance measures for these cases.</p>
<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: "To His Excellency Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing National Government: On May 23rd of this year, an American sailor named Blaney pushed his fellow sailor, Shirley, into the Huangpu River at the Jinliyuan Wharf. When a Chinese man named Dai Tingzuo went to rescue him, he was also pushed into the river and drowned. Furthermore, on May 26th, several American soldiers, while walking on Rue de Consulat and Gordon Road, used bayonets to stab Chinese men Ma Ruixiang and Qu Shixiang, causing serious injuries that endangered their lives. At the same time, they also beat a child named Qu Haigou, who was under the age of sixteen. In just three days, American soldiers caused the drowning of one Chinese person, the stabbing of two, and the beating of one. The facts are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable, yet the culprits remain at large. This is intolerable and endangers our nation. The cruelty of these American sailors cannot be ignored. We have already submitted the matter to a meeting, publicly issued a declaration, and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting serious negotiations. We respectfully request that you approve and conduct strict negotiations to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrators, providing compensation, issuing an apology, and permanently prohibiting American sailors from carrying bayonets and freely landing on shore, in order to prevent future tragedies. At the same time, please instruct the authorities of the Public Concession to assume responsibility for the safety of Chinese residents and pedestrians before China recovers the concessions. We urge you to negotiate strongly to achieve the above goals. All citizens of Shanghai will vigorously support the negotiations. We hereby respectfully submit this cable and await your instructions. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation bows in respect."</p>

<h3 id="e146">Third Strike by Bookbinding Workers <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Insisting on a 40% Wage Increase</p>
<p>Approximately 1,800 workers from 150 Chinese and foreign bookbinding shops in the city, including Ma Hongji, went on strike again starting on the 30th, with authorities' attempts at persuasion proving unsuccessful. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Third Strike: Chinese and foreign bookbinding workers have previously staged two strikes demanding changes to their treatment conditions. These were fully resolved after repeated mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, with wages uniformly increased by 10% of the original amount. All workers expressed dissatisfaction and went on strike again, gathering at the workers' union in Tianji Lane, Rue Say-Zoong Road to question the representatives. The union repeatedly tried to persuade them without success.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress: The bookbinding union immediately convened a general meeting of all representatives at the Third District Party Headquarters to gather opinions. Representatives from the Bureau of Social Affairs, including Wang Bing, and 116 representatives attended. The presidium, consisting of Zhang Jinhong, Zhang Haosheng, and Chao Guosheng, reported on the progress. Representatives from the Bureau of Social Affairs then provided guidance, but the workers insisted on a 40% wage increase, making it impossible to stop them. It was resolved to appoint ten people, including Lu Axiang, Shen Changjiang, Chen Zhiting, and Xue Lanxin, to assist the board of supervisors in coordinating with the Book Association to firmly demand that apprentices in the bookbinding industry be treated in accordance with the previously agreed-upon agreement.</p>

<p>Bureau of Social Affairs' Reply to Lawyer Chen Zhigao's Letter</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Zhigao inquired about whether the Bureau of Social Affairs has the authority to mediate and dispatch personnel to investigate disputes between employers, citing the Shuimu Industry Union and Wang Fukang Xinhasheng letters as examples. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs replied, stating: "Regarding your inquiry about whether a union has the authority to mediate and dispatch personnel to investigate disputes between employers, we have found that the Trade Union Law does not explicitly grant unions the authority to mediate disputes between employers, so they do not have such authority. This reply is hereby provided for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Significant Decline in Zhejiang Province's Spring Silkworm Harvest <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Only 30% of the Expected Yield</p>
<p>The silkworm season in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province starts earlier than in Jiangsu Province, with Hangzhou and Shaoxing starting several days earlier than Jiaxing and Huzhou. This year, the weather has been unfavorable, with continuous spring rains. Early silkworms were found to be diseased and were abandoned, and farmers raised late silkworms as a substitute. However, the cold weather and prolonged rainy season delayed their development, resulting in a significant shortage of cocoons. Only about 30% of the expected yield was harvested. In Hangzhou's Linping, Yuhang, Pingyao, Chang'an, and Haining, as well as the old Shaoxing prefecture, cocoon merchants are only receiving about 30% of the cocoons compared to previous years. Shanghai silk merchants, noting the sharp decline in overseas silk markets and the poor silkworm season, have been reluctant to invest in Hangzhou to purchase cocoons this year. Most merchants have set up small-scale drying operations. The cocoon markets in Hangzhou and Shaoxing have been open for over a week, but the supply of cocoons is limited, with many being of inferior quality. Each merchant's purchase volume is only about 20-30% of previous years. Most have now stopped purchasing. The highest cocoon price was for improved Shaoxing cocoons, reaching 60 or 58 yuan, while the lowest price was for Hangzhou cocoons, only 40-42 yuan. The average price is around 50 yuan. Drying requires 320-330 catties of raw cocoons, while reeling requires 580-590 catties. Personnel sent by Shanghai silk mills, such as Tianchang, to Hangzhou and Shaoxing to purchase cocoons have now concluded their operations and returned to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Butchers in the Concessions to Meet Today to Discuss</p>
<p>The pre-slaughter inspection fees for fresh pork in the city's concessions were previously contracted by Zhang Baokun, who charged one dime per pig to the government. Starting yesterday, the municipal government took over the operations itself, with personnel from the Finance and Health Bureaus charging per pig at the Xuejiabang pig market and issuing permits. Butchers in the concessions found the procedures cumbersome and time-consuming, hindering sales. Furthermore, misunderstandings arose because the previous contractor charged on a monthly basis, leading many to not purchase permits. The municipal government deemed this failure to purchase permits inappropriate and immediately seized the pigs, totaling over 2,000. Representatives of the butchers, led by Huang Xunhua, petitioned the Finance and Health Bureaus and managed to have the seized pigs temporarily released into the concessions around 5:00 PM yesterday. Butchers in the concessions are scheduled to meet at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Truth about Shen Yun's Suicide <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Confirmed to Be Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Regarding the suicide of Shanghai Art University student Shen Yun, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper, his body has been temporarily placed in the Fujian Guild Hall, financed by his classmates, and a telegram has been sent to his family. The deceased married last year and has parents over sixty years old. His brother's name is Ru Bi, who works for the Ruihe Company in Singapore. Shen Yun's given name is Ru Bao. The claim of Baozhu Yun is false. It is said that the truth about his suicide is entirely due to economic pressure, and the immediate cause was the theft of funds sent from home, leading to financial difficulties and forcing him to resort to this desperate measure. The facts are that two months ago, his brother Ru Bi remitted 80 Singapore dollars, equivalent to about 193.20 Shanghai dollars, from Singapore. However, after the insurance letter arrived at the Art University, it was stolen in transit. Shen Yun has been struggling ever since, borrowing money and pawning items, even pawning his friends' belongings in desperation. On the eighth of last month, he was detained by the French Concession police. He was bailed out by a friend and moved to 165 Rue Dupleix. At this time, he had almost nothing left except for a suit and a few books. Therefore, before committing suicide at the Tiansheng Hotel on Route Macao Bao Lu on the 28th, he sold a suitcase and several books, using the money to buy opium and pay the rent. After Shen's death, several suicide notes were found. One letter to his parents reads: "Dear parents, after this incident, I truly cannot live in this world any longer. Now I have no choice but to take this desperate measure. I believe you will curse me and scold me, but this is what I deserve. However, I hope that you will take good care of yourselves and not grieve or cry for this useless son. I will repay your kindness in the next life. What else can I say? I am determined, truly determined. Unfilial son Bao writes with finality." Another letter was addressed to the principal of Art University, Zhou Qinhao, and another to his classmates and friends. The letter to Zhou stated that the incident was entirely due to economic problems and that old matters need not be mentioned. The letter to his friends stated that the borrowed money could be claimed from Mr. Zhou and that a letter should be written after his death to inform the family of what had happened.</p>

<p>The Landlady is Also Injured</p>
<p>Ying Lianyuan, a tub maker from Wusong, lived in a bungalow on Pingliang Road, Grand Road. At half past eleven the night before last, he had already gone to sleep when he heard the sound of someone prying open the door. Fearing burglars, he woke up his landlady, Zhao Zhang, and others to open the door to check. They saw three thugs with weapons intruding. Ying shouted "Thieves!" but the thugs had guns and fired nine shots, hitting Ying Lianyuan and Zhao Zhang in vital areas, causing them to fall to the ground immediately. The thugs then fled. Ying's son, waiting for his father to return, went out to look for him and found him lying stiff on the roadside. He touched him and found that he was already dead. He hurried to report to the police station at the intersection of Pingliang Road. By the time the police arrived, the thugs had already fled far away. The deceased Ying Lianyuan was fifty-nine years old and was shot twice, with bullets passing through his chest. Zhao Zhang, a local, was fifty years old and was shot in the right breast and right arm. She is currently being treated in the hospital and her injuries are quite serious.</p>
<p>Huamin Tobacco Company</p>
<h3 id="e157">Lawsuit After Liquidation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Da Zhongguo Printing Company Sues for Printing Costs</p>
<p>Judgment for Wu Chengyu to Repay</p>
<p>Wu Chengyu, a Cantonese, was appointed by Huamin Tobacco Company to liquidate the accounts. He published an advertisement on March 25th of the 17th year (1928), convening a joint meeting of creditors and debtors of the company. It was agreed that all outstanding debts would be repaid at 50% and that creditors should collect their dues from Wu's law office before October 15th of that year. Da Zhongguo Printing Company printed decorations for Huamin cigarettes and was owed 4,513 yuan in printing fees. According to the resolution, they were entitled to 2,256.50 yuan. They sent someone to Wu's office to collect the dues. Wu's employee gave them a check with the amount filled in as 1,562 yuan. Because the amount was 694 yuan short of what was owed, they refused to accept it. Da Zhongguo Printing Company then hired lawyer Yang Guoshu to send a letter to Wu Chengyu, questioning the reason for not repaying according to the resolution. Wu initially ignored the letter. Later, he replied that he had already returned the money to Huamin and that they should claim it from Huamin. He then blamed Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing, the persons in charge of Huamin's liquidation. Shortly after, Ling died, causing the case to drag on until now. Da Zhongguo, not having received a penny, hired lawyer Yang again to sue Wu Chengyu, Rong Jieqing, and the heirs of the deceased Ling Runxiang for joint repayment. After several hearings in the Special District Local Court, the defendant Wu Chengyu hired lawyer Zhang Deqin to defend him. The court appointed special agents for Rong and Ling. Judge Yang Yi has now ruled that the defendant Wu Chengyu must repay the plaintiff 2,256.50 yuan and bear the costs of litigation. Rong and Ling are not responsible for joint repayment. The reasoning in the judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>"The plaintiff initially sued Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing for repayment of the debt. Ling Runxiang stated in court that after Huamin Tobacco Company went bankrupt, Wu Chengyu was responsible for the liquidation. The total debt was over 20,000 yuan. The company's sale price was about 11,000 yuan, which was to be used to repay the debt at 50%. Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing sent all the sale money to Wu Chengyu. The plaintiff then added Wu Chengyu as a party to the lawsuit. Adding a defendant due to a change in circumstances after the lawsuit has been filed is permissible by law if it does not significantly hinder the defendant's defense and the conclusion of the lawsuit. Wu Chengyu's defense is unreasonable. Wu Chengyu was appointed as the liquidator by Huamin Tobacco Company, and the company's sale price was sent to Wu Chengyu by Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing. Wu Chengyu has not returned the outstanding funds. Ling Runxiang stated this in court. Wu Chengyu claimed that the funds had been claimed by Zhou Yunxun, the company's accountant, because the plaintiff failed to claim the funds on time, and he presented Zhou Yunxun's receipt as evidence. Regardless of whether Zhou Yunxun had the right to claim the funds, Ling Runxiang stated that Zhou Yunxun died in the sinking of the Xinhua ship. Zhou Yunxun has been dead for a long time. Wu Chengyu's claim that Zhou Yunxun received the funds is unprovable. It is beyond doubt that the funds are still with Wu Chengyu. If the funds had been handed over to Zhou Yunxun, Ling Runxiang would have known. The defendant Wu Chengyu, as the liquidator representing Huamin Tobacco Company, cannot ignore the plaintiff's claim. He should be responsible for repayment. Although the defendants Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing were employees of the company, the company appointed Wu Chengyu to be responsible for the liquidation, and the defendants Ling Runxiang and Rong Jieqing are not responsible for the liquidation and repayment. The plaintiff's request for a ruling that Ling Runxiang's heirs and Rong Jieqing be jointly responsible for repayment is groundless. Furthermore, the defendant Wu Chengyu did not appear on the date of the oral debate, and the judgment was made unilaterally at the plaintiff's request. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 457 and 98 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the following judgment is made as the main text."</p>

<h3 id="e158">Union Bribery Case Concludes with Interrogation <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Fifth of This Month</p>
<p>The Wusong Wing On No. 2 Cotton Mill union was bribed by the management to cease activities at the end of the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929). Following orders from the Central Party Headquarters, the Control Yuan, and the High Court, the local court thoroughly investigated the matter. After Prosecutor Zhao concluded his investigation and filed a public prosecution, the case was repeatedly reported on in previous issues after court hearings. It has now been learned that the case was concluded at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday by Judge Wu Zhen, along with jurors Qian Chengjun and Zhao Yongzhou, presiding in the third courtroom. Sentencing is scheduled for the fifth of this month. Jin Fan, who was detained, was ordered to be returned to detention to await bail, while the others remained under their original bail. The details of the interrogation are as follows:</p>
<p>Interrogation Records:</p>
<p>(1) Questioning of Shan Han Jian: According to his statement, Tan Huanxiang asked me to lobby. I talked to Tan alone. Later, when the money was handed over, I talked with Yan Gunian and Jin Fan together. The money was provided by the management. Asked who from the management, he replied he couldn’t specifically identify them. Asked who he thought it was, he replied that he observed it might be Guo Shunlin, Ping Ying, etc. Asked where the one thousand yuan was, he replied that the money was given to our union. I know that part of it was used for lawyer fees, two hundred yuan was used to pay off union debts, and the remainder was given to Tan Huanxiang for purposes such as petitions and lawsuits.</p>
<p>(2) Questioning of Yan Gunian: According to his statement, all lobbying matters were decided by the union, which can be verified by the minutes. The reason for asking for money was to obtain evidence for filing charges. Asked if charges couldn't be filed without money, he replied that the union had no funds for filing charges. Asked if Li Yixiong’s accusations against the union were instigated by the management and if the party headquarters was bribed, he replied that he didn't know.</p>
<p>(3) Questioning of Jin Fan: According to his statement, Tan Huanxiang instigated us to resign. We wanted him to have evidence for filing charges, so we resigned. Asked if Hong Dongyi was present when the money was handed over, he replied that he was. Asked where the money came from, he replied that Tan Huanxiang said it was provided by the management. Asked who from the management, he replied that it was ultimately provided by the Wing On manager because he was the person in charge of the factory.</p>
<p>(4) Questioning of Li Yixiong: Asked if he had any feud with Yan Gunian and Jin Fan, he replied no. Asked why he accused them, he replied that the union was not run well. Asked what was not run well, he still replied that it was not run well. Asked if he accused them on his own initiative, he replied yes. Asked who was in charge inside the factory, Li did not answer. Asked if he knew Tan Huanxiang, he said he did not recognize him. He said the workers told me to accuse them, and when asked which workers, he replied that there were some from each department.</p>
<p>(5) Questioning of Deng Yutian: Asked if he had met Li Yixiong, he replied no. Asked why he was asked to submit the petition on his behalf, he replied that he would be given a position after the reorganization. Asked if Guo Shun and Tan Huanxiang knew each other, he replied no. Asked if he recognized Hong Dongyi, he replied no. Asked if Lin Pingying knew them, he replied no. Asked who was in charge inside the factory, he replied that he was in charge. Asked if the one thousand yuan was provided by the management, and if the management was referring to him, he replied that we did not provide the money.</p>
<p>(7) Questioning of Lin Pingying: Asked where the one thousand yuan came from, he replied he didn't know. Asked who was in charge inside the factory, he replied that he was in charge and that he handled the negotiations. Asked if he had been to the party headquarters before it stopped the union's activities, he replied no. Asked if he knew that Li Yixiong was accusing the union, he replied he didn't know. Asked if he recognized Hong Dongyi, he replied no.</p>
<p>(8) Questioning of Guan Fu: When asked whether Yan Gunian and Jin Fan took money within the party headquarters, he replied that he did not know.</p>
<p>Lawyer's Arguments: The arguments then began, and Prosecutor Zhao was invited to attend the court. First, lawyer Xu Shihao argued on behalf of Guo Shun and Lin Pingying, stating that judgment should be based on evidence and not on speculation. Now, Shan Han Jian, Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, and others only stated that Tan Huanxiang and Hong Dongyi delivered a bribe of one thousand yuan. Tan and Hong only stated that the money was provided by the management, but they could not specify who from the management it was. Therefore, it cannot be speculated that Guo and Lin, etc., were the providers of the funds. Wing On is a corporate organization, and all shareholders are the management. Can they all be considered criminals? Therefore, he requested a verdict of not guilty.</p>
<p>Then, lawyer Shen Yong argued on behalf of Jin Fan, Yan Gunian, and Chen Han Jian: (1) (Regarding the facts) The facts are the basis for legal judgment. A slight error can lead to a huge mistake. Therefore, it should be stated first that Yan Gunian is the accuser, not a defendant who has been accused. The outbreak of this case occurred on January 13, 1930, when unemployed workers from Wing On detained Tan Huanxiang, who was selling out the workers, at Ximen and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau. Subsequently, the party headquarters summoned the accusers Yan Gunian and Wang Yuncheng for questioning and detained them. The Public Security Bureau investigated the case and announced it throughout Shanghai. Prior to the outbreak, starting from December 9, 1929, a resolution was passed at a meeting, which proves that Yan, Jin, and Jian, etc., carried out the union's decision to feign cooperation with Tan Huanxiang, Hong Dongyi, etc. On January 11, 1930, all work was completed, and a summary report was submitted to Committee Members Zhu Guilin and Guo Yongxi of the Social Affairs Bureau, and a report was also submitted to the bureau. Subsequently, the workers took the leader to the party headquarters for investigation. Based on this, it can be seen that if Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, etc., had not carried out the union's decision and completed the accusation, this bribery case would still be unknown. Therefore, Yan, etc., are accusers, not defendants. This is clearly evident and is a fact that is very relevant to the law and should be stated. As for the bribe of one thousand yuan, it was used for union purposes and was not owned by Yan, etc. This can be proven by the union's minutes and should also be stated. (2) (Regarding the law) Article 24 of the Criminal Law states that unintentional acts are not punishable. What is considered intentional? The current Criminal Law adopts the "hope" principle, meaning that if a person does not hope to commit a crime but does so, it is not considered intentional. Now, Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, etc., did not hope to obtain a bribe. Evidence shows that they did not possess the bribe, so it is clearly not intentional. Precedent No. 233 from the fifth year of the Supreme Court states that for a crime to be established, knowledge of the criminal facts is required. Therefore, using a forged document requires knowledge that it is forged and intentional use. If it is received and then submitted as evidence in a lawsuit, it cannot be considered using it as a crime. Now, Yan, etc., carried out the union's decision to obtain evidence of bribery and made an accusation. According to the above-mentioned legal precedents, there is no possibility of punishment. (3) (Regarding reason and emotion) The current government advocates integrity throughout the country and strives to eliminate all acts of dishonesty. Both bribery and accepting bribes are secretive acts. If the accuser is equated with the defendant, who will be willing to make accusations in the future? Directly imposing unfair treatment on the accuser indirectly provides considerable protection to the person who bribes or accepts a bribe. How can this be reasonable? Therefore, placing Yan, etc., on the list of defendants is unreasonable in terms of both reason and emotion. Based on the above three points, we should request a verdict of not guilty for Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, and Chen Han Jian, etc., according to the law. As for the facts of Yan, etc.'s accusation, they are all present. We should request your court to punish Yan, etc., according to the law. Yan, etc., spoke publicly and did not have any personal intentions.</p>
<p>Continuing, lawyer Jiang Baolian also argued on behalf of Jin Fan, Yan Gunian, and Chen Han Jian, stating that Li Yixiong's complaint against Jin Fan and Yan Gunian was a matter of management lobbying, which is of utmost importance and should be investigated. Continuing, lawyer Ge Zhaoji argued on behalf of Deng Yutian, stating that Deng Yutian only forwarded a petition for Li Yixiong. If this is considered to be related to the bribery case, then everyone would be in danger of forwarding letters and documents for friends who are unaware of the situation. He requested a verdict of not guilty.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Trust Company's public land at 801 North Sichuan Road was divided and sold for the second time, it has been widely praised by the public, resulting in a rush to purchase. According to the latest news, only three plots of land remain, each measuring one fen, four li, and one hao, with a length of seventy feet and a width of fourteen feet. The selling price is 1,269 taels, and it can be used to build a three-story Chinese or Western-style residential building. The building occupies over fifty-five feet of the land, and fifteen feet are used as a garden. The construction cost is approximately 2,500 taels. The cost of building a Western-style house and purchasing the land is only over 2,700 taels, a modest amount for obtaining an elegant and beautiful Western-style house, making it a good opportunity for homeowners. It is heard that the company is currently starting construction on the first model village. Those who want to obtain beautiful residences should purchase from the company as soon as possible, as only three plots remain, and they may soon miss the opportunity.</p>

<p>Interfering in Civil Matters and Injuring People with a Club</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to Jones, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Association, stating that our member, Xieren Rice Store, which was previously located at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, moved to the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road in February of this year. Therefore, we rented the rooftop to Du Shengchang for continued use. Around 4 p.m. on the 19th of this month, Du Shengchang brought an electricity company bill to our store, claiming that the electricity bill for the rooftop was incorrect and insisted that our Yang Zishan go to the electricity company to verify it. Mr. Yang said that it was late and the electricity company was closed, and that our store was also settling accounts, so he suggested going together tomorrow. Mr. Du refused, used abusive language, and repeatedly hit the counter with his cane. After persuasion from colleagues, he left angrily. Shortly after, Mr. Du sent Constable No. 1666 to arrest Mr. Yang. We believe that the incorrect calculation of the electricity bill is a civil matter and has nothing to do with the police. However, the constable was unreasonable and accused Mr. Yang of disobeying orders, dragging him out of the store. At that time, our employee Zhang Gengsheng stepped forward to dissuade him but was beaten with a wooden club. Then, the constable colluded with Constables Nos. 1714 and 1817, who were patrolling the street, to help the assailant and arrest Mr. Yang and Mr. Zhang, taking them to the police station. Along the way, they were punched and kicked, causing serious injuries to Mr. Yang and Mr. Zhang, as evidenced by the injury certificates from Renji Hospital. The constable, knowing that there was no basis for the charges, falsely accused Mr. Yang and Mr. Zhang of obstructing official duties to vent his anger. The duty of the police is to protect the people, but the constable dared to assault and insult merchants, showing a disregard for the law. The merchants and residents are suffering deeply. We are appealing to your council to seriously negotiate with the police authorities fairly and justly to deter violence. The calculation of the electricity bill is a minor civil matter. The constables intervened and even used clubs to beat people, which is extremely barbarous. After this, the merchants in the concession will live in fear. We are writing to you to request that your council uphold justice and quickly negotiate with the Municipal Council to severely punish the violent constables to punish violence and protect the lives of the people. After verification, we believe that such abuse of power and assault of residents is a violation of the original intention of your council in establishing the police. It seems that appropriate sanctions should be imposed to maintain police discipline. We are writing to you to request that you investigate and handle this matter quickly so as not to fail the trust of the taxpayers."</p>

<p>Theft: Chen Shanzhong, a Ningbo native, was riding a tram the day before yesterday when his purse containing fifteen yuan and seven jiao was stolen.

He previously operated the Yuanda Yong Wine Shop near the vegetable market on Wuzhou Road, but it closed down in October of last year. He is now a land broker. Yesterday evening at 7 p.m., he was invited by his friend Wang Yixiang (a playboy living on Zhaofeng Road) for dinner. Zhang, who is a carpenter, was also present. They all knew each other and enjoyed themselves. After the meal, Zhang and Wang invited Zhang to borrow money from Zhang's father, who lives at Xiyaojiaqiao on Taopeng Road. Unexpectedly, when they were not far from their destination, in a remote and deserted place with no one around, Dexing was walking in front, and Wang and Zhang were behind. Zhang suddenly took out a sharp axe and struck Dexing's head once, his right hand once, his back once, and his right leg three times, breaking his tibia. Zhang ran forward in pain and collapsed in front of a villager's door, shouting for help. The assailant fled into the darkness. Hearing the shouts, the villagers came and reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, which ordered the police to take the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Zhang was barely breathing and covered in blood when he arrived at the hospital. After an investigation by reporters, the truth seemed to be that it was caused by jealousy.</p>

<p>Scarred Face Makes Him Easy to Catch</p>
<p>Cheng Guoliang, a Shaoxing native, was originally a plasterer but became a bandit in recent years. On the third day of the twelfth lunar month of last year, he and his accomplices kidnapped Wu Jiaxiang, a wealthy merchant from Cixi, and his son Jinzhang.

The Yuyao Public Security Bureau has now arrested a bandit named Zhang in the case, who confessed that Cheng Guoliang had fled to 286 Yuanfang Road in Shanghai. The bureau sent Detective Li, along with Xue, to Shanghai to identify and arrest him because Cheng has a scar on his face, and Xue witnessed the kidnapping and could identify him. Yesterday, Detective Li requested assistance from the Huishan Police Station. The captain dispatched detectives to go to the address and arrest Cheng. He was then taken to the Special District Court. Xue identified the defendant in court as the kidnapper, but Cheng denied it. Judge Feng stated that the requesting personnel did not bring formal documents requesting extradition, so the procedures were incomplete. He ordered that the bandit be detained temporarily and that the Zhejiang Provincial Government be prepared to send someone to Shanghai to extradite him for interrogation.</p>

<p>Threats and Rape in Hotel</p>
<p>Sent to Court for Severe Punishment According to Law</p>
<p>Xu Genshan, a local resident of Xujiazhai, North of the Flying Machine Ground on Sheshan Road in West Shanghai, is a Taoist priest. He only has two daughters, the elder named A'di and the younger named Linbao. Xu Genshan feared that his lineage would end, so in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925), he hired Shen Shichang from Wang Manshui Bridge to be his son-in-law, renaming him Xu Yongsheng. In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), he officially married A'di. A'di died in childbirth last autumn (August), and the child also died shortly after. However, Yongsheng does not engage in honest work and has become a scoundrel. Last month, he was driven out by his father-in-law, Xu Genshan. Suddenly, on the evening of the day before yesterday (May 31) around 8 p.m., Yongsheng gathered six or seven people and, taking advantage of his parents-in-law not being home, suddenly robbed his sister-in-law Linbao. They put her in a car and drove quickly east to Room 14 of the Huimin Hotel on Sisede Long Road in the French Concession of Xujiahui. They threatened and raped her, but Linbao vowed to die resisting, so her clothes were torn. She shouted at the top of her lungs. At that critical moment, Detective Ding Wensheng from the French police station was patrolling and entered the room. He brought the man and woman back to the police station for questioning. The captain interrogated them and, because the case occurred in the interior, sent them to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District of Xujiahui yesterday afternoon. After a preliminary hearing by Chief Liu, the woman Xu Linbao, who is 21 years old and unmarried, stated that she was suddenly robbed by her brother-in-law Xu Yongsheng, who had gathered a crowd, and taken to the Huimin Hotel in Yangjiaku, where she was threatened and raped. The woman resisted and shouted for help, but she was unable to resist and was eventually raped for thirty minutes. Later, the detective arrived and took them back to the police station. Xu Yongsheng (Shen Shichang) stated that he is 24 years old and a Taoist priest. He married into the Xu family when he was 18 years old. Now, because his wife and children have died, and he has recently been driven out by his father-in-law, he invited people to rob his sister-in-law to be his wife, but he did not rape her. Chief Liu stated that the case involved gathering a crowd to rob and threatening rape, which is extremely illegal. He ordered them to be detained and sent to the local court this morning to be prosecuted according to the law.</p>

There was also one applicant who needed to reapply after obtaining a union certificate because the certificate was inconsistent. A vote was requested on whether these steps were appropriate. The meeting resolved to approve all the above steps. (2) A decision was needed on whether to extend the deadline for issuing society membership certificates to newly recruited members. The meeting resolved to extend the deadline to June 6 for ten days. If a member had to return home due to circumstances, an extension would be granted, and the distribution would be scheduled over three days with a notice to all members. (3) A decision was needed on whether to designate committee members to be responsible for issuing membership certificates. The meeting resolved that it was necessary to designate committee members. Chen Hesan (陳荷三) and Li Jinsheng (李金生) were designated for the first district on June 6, Ru Shensxiu (茹愼修) and Tang Wenliang (唐文亮) on the 7th, Lin Jinfu (林錦福) and Shi Zongliang (史宗良) on the 8th, Ye Baozhong (葉寳忠) and Wang Kaichun (王開春) on the 9th, and Hu Ruirong (胡瑞榮) and Zhang Tongfu (張通夫) on the 10th. They would work with Zhao Zhenhui (趙振輝) and Fang Qingjian (方清鑑) to handle the process. (4) The society's investigation of membership transportation expenses amounted to $40 or $50. The union's finances were tight and could not cover the costs. A decision was needed on how to proceed. The meeting resolved to wait until the union's May dues were collected before making a decision or borrowing the funds from the society. (5) The society collected a $2 membership fee and monthly dues up to May, with the June dues going to the union. A vote was requested on whether these steps were appropriate. The meeting resolved to proceed accordingly. (6) A letter from manager Yu Liangxin (郁良心) and Shi Qintang (施琴堂) requested permission for a friend to join the society. A decision was needed on how to proceed. The meeting resolved to reply to Shi Qintang that the deadline had passed and accommodation was not possible. (7) A decision was needed on how to handle workers from Cai Tongde (蔡同德) who had not joined the union. The meeting resolved to hand it over to the union's executive and supervisory committees for handling.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editors, Upon reading your newspaper, I saw a news item titled "Lin Lin Suddenly Arrested," which stated that Lin Lin was a student at the 文生 (Wen Sheng) English School. After investigation, our school has no student by the name of Lin Lin. To prevent any misunderstanding from the outside world, I am writing to request a correction and ask that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, 文生 Higher English School, June 1st.</p>

<p>Huada Pharmacy on Avenue Foch (福煦路華達藥行) announces that the manager of this store, the German Martha Pharmaceutical Factory, has a potent brand of chicken broth, 獅力牌 (Lion Strength Brand), that comes in large bottles, with a price slightly above the reach of the average person, making it difficult to purchase at any time. Knowing that it has great benefits but lacking the purchasing power is a shame. Recently, to remedy this deficiency, the factory has specially produced a No. 2 bottle, which sells for only two dollars, to make it more accessible. Lately, the purchase of No. 2 chicken broth has been very enthusiastic, indicating that this special production is quite suitable for our society's needs.</p>
<p>Meida Silk and Foreign Goods Company on 4th Ma Road (四馬路美大綢緞洋貨公司) announces that our company has always been known for its low prices and good quality. Recently, as summer is approaching, it is the season for all walks of life to make summer clothes. Therefore, starting from the previous day, we are holding a summer grand sale and establishing a stock clearance sale section and a remnant fabric section. For any clothing material purchased, only one dime is charged per piece, etc.</p>
<p>Since its founding, the Old Duck Brand (老鴨牌) cross-stitch embroidery thread has enjoyed a widespread reputation. According to Mr. Xue Zuyin (薛祖蔭) of the sales department, the raw materials are entirely domestic, and the surface and quality are no different from imported products, with prices kept as low as possible. As a result, sales are strong both in the north and south. We are currently adding workers to increase production. Those who patronize us are requested to visit the Yifenghao (義豐號) store in Chunyuan Lane (春源里), West Old Warehouse Street (西舊倉街), Old North Gate (老北門), where we will directly discuss the matter.</p>

<p>The 百星 (Bai Xing) Grand Theater at the intersection of Route des Soeurs (老靶子路) and Avenue Haig (福生路) announces that starting yesterday, we are screening the latest production of the 聯華 (Lianhua) Company, the unprecedentedly magnificent epic "The Conflict of Love and Desire" (愛慾之爭). This film is produced by Luo Mingyou (羅明佑) and stars Wang Cilong (王次龍), Zhou Wenzhu (周文珠), Tang Tianxiu (湯天繡), and other stars. It depicts the subtleties of love and the mystery of the conflict between the spirit and the desires, making it the crown jewel of domestic films.</p>
<p>The 大東 (Da Dong) Film Company announces that despite the recent rainy weather, we have not relaxed our efforts in film production. Yesterday, we filmed the farewell scene from the second episode of "The Chivalrous Hero's Biography" (俠義英雄傳). Director Wang Fuqing (汪福慶) and male and female stars Zhang Qingtao (張清濤) and Zhang Jingzhen (張靜珍) played the lead roles, and their performances were excellent in every way, with the delicacy of their movements being unparalleled in domestic films.</p>
<p>The 華東 (Hua Dong) Film Company announces that the historical epic "Huanghuagang" (黄花崗), which has been in preparation for a long time, is now ready and will begin location shooting on June 1. Manager Song Tingbin (宋廷濱), director Yang Zuixia (楊醉俠), assistant director Dong Qiman (董綺蔓), lead director Ma Liqiaoershi (馬麗喬爾士), and lead actor Shi Daxing (士大星) are all involved. It is rumored that the plot is mysterious and the background is magnificent. When the film is completed and released, it will surely be spectacular.</p>
<p>The 華劇 (Hua Ju) Film Company announces that since the release of the first two episodes of "King of Ten Thousand Heroes" (萬俠之王), everyone has been rushing to see them, and it has been a resounding success. Now, the third episode of "King of Ten Thousand Heroes" is directed by martial arts star Zhang Huimin (張惠民) and is even more thrilling and suspenseful. The oddity of the locations, the precariousness of the terrain, and the depth of the performance are unparalleled in domestic martial arts films. The interior scenes are also quite grand and magnificent. In addition, Miss Wu Suxin's (吳素馨) performance as Ru Gu (茹姑), a delicate and weak woman who is able to fight enemies and move like the wind on the rugged, protruding, and winding mountain crags, is admirable. The performances of Misses Wu Susu (吳素素) and Zhang Jianying (張劍英) are lively, strange, precise, and unconventional, showing true artistic talent. Therefore, the success of this film is not easy. The plot of this film is bizarre, and the intention is profound, making it worthy of appreciation by martial arts experts, worthy of study by explorers, worthy of material by writers, and worthy of depiction by artists. The editing is now complete, and it is scheduled to be released on June 5 at the Central Theater.</p>
