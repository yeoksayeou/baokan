<p>「主席諸位同志今天辱承遼寗國民外交協會這種盛意的招待兄弟代表同人表示甚深的謝意兄弟曾經到過東北好幾回每逢到了東北和東北接觸一回東北就給我一個更好的印像更多的認識更深的理解這種印像認識理解不獨令我對於東北感覺着發生更密切的關係而且往往令我因此而此夺厚我的愛國心尤其是對於東北那種關懐眷戀的心爲什麽因爲東北是中國北部一個最重要的門户物產的豐富固然不必說及就是單拿國際的關係來說東北也是佔着一個狠重要的地位東北旣然站在這種重要的地位上便自然而然對於中國的國防上和經濟生存上發生特别密接的關係簡單說·就是東北境内所發生的切事情時常要牽涉到整個中國的安危上而令人時刻不忘地關懐着東北覺得東北和自己的本身有密切的關係所以前次奉中央命令來到東北慰勞軍隊的時候轉赴吉黑回來便發出「不到東北不知中國之博大不到東北不知中國之危機」兩句口號就是因爲這種原故不過有好些人是鈍感的他們素來對於利害只知道所以違心的一端而不知道所以違心的他端只能够看見帝國主發者經濟上之壓迫而不能够看見帝國主義者除了經濟以外的種種壓迫這種毛病尤以關内的人民爲甚因爲他們只能够天天看見帝國主義者拿着各種的東西來換了我們的金錢去其餘就一概感不着切身關係的原故但是東北就大大的不同了除了金錢以外還有政治上的壓迫軍事上的壓迫和其他種種最深刻最屈辱的壓迫一齊都衆匯到東北來這眞可以說這是壓迫得最厲害的地方所以東北的民衆對於帝國主義者的侵略分外覺得切膚之痛而愛國熱心也遠比關内人更爲熱烈了兄弟每天早晨起來打開窗户一望就感覺自己的精神興奮起來的也因爲覺得帝國主義者的魔爪全部在我的眼前展開着的原故所以在關内的民衆對於帝國主義者的侵略無論怎樣的疏忽一到了關外的東北就馬上會感着切身的利害了受着這種束縛受着這種壓迫那末·無論什麽人都會感着興奮的是當然的結果在這一點上來講也就可以知道關外民衆的愛國心更比關内爲熱烈了何况關内的民衆已經知道快要達到和帝國主義者短兵相接的時候呢我們看一看遼寗國民外交協會的成立也就可想而知剛才聽見主席說遼寗國民外交協會成立是前次赤俄擾邊的時候遼寗地方有志的民衆因爲感覺着外患的迫切爲要使全國的民衆都來注意東北的問題而發起的換一句話來說就是依照總理的這囑爲求中國之自由平等必須喚起民衆的意旨而成立的所以國民外交協會的最大主張就是求中國的自由平等也就是要全國都來注意東北的赤白兩帝國主義的侵略而求中國的自由平等的兄弟常常在報紙上看見貴會做了狠多極其實貫的工作這是令兄弟十分佩服十分讚同的可惜兄弟素來對於國際外交上的事情浸有多大的材料貢獻給諸倉而且有好些又不能率直宜布得出來的這是十分遺憾的事現在對於赤白兩帝國主義者的侵略照我個人所知道的略略宣布一些大約也可以做貴會的參考的吧</p>
<p>東北擁有廣大的土地和豐富的物產所以對於現在列强的人口問題和資本主義已經還到飽和狀態的時候便没有一個帝國主義者不想向着東北開一條新路沾一沾東北的利益好像從前的四國借欵圑也是想進入東北境内要來均霑利益的一個明證不過當時日本爲了自身的切身利益關係起見便和俄國聯結起來壓迫四國借欵圑結局四國借欵圑便從此停頓下來了現在的東北南部有白色日本帝國主義的壓迫北部有赤色蘇俄帝國主義者的侵略而這兩個帝國主義者的陰狠政策遠在俄皇時代已經由俄國外相隡佐諾夫和日本桂太郎訂結了秘密的協約佈置着瓜分所謂滿蒙了後來俄國十月革命之後雖然宣布了自然放棄一切不平等條約但是對於滿蒙的侵略依然傳統的繼承着帝政時代的侵略政策直到現在還没有改變一絲一毫的態度好像對於中東路的事件一樣他們不獨不履行條約而且結局還要用武力壓迫中國又蔑視十三年五月所簽訂的大綱裏第五條規定居然仍舊控制外蒙這些事情豈是號稱革命的社會主義國所應有的態度其實和帝國主義的資本主義國没有一分的差别呢他們不獨根據着中東路做宣傳赤化的大本營而且爲要侵略東北的原故便極力收買中國境内的土匪流氓擾亂中國的治安破壞中國的和平以致湘鄂贛等素稱富饒的地方都給他閙的一塌塗糊這就可以知道赤俄用心的險毒了現在中國之所以不能着手建設的就是因爲給赤俄收買了土匪流氓反動派等所謂共產黨攪亂了中國的治安而使中國的人民不安的原故（未完）</p>

<p>市政府爲編修本市通志已於前年六月設立市通誌館籌備委員會由張市長委派敎育財政社會三局局長着手進行茲以該會事務繁重非三數人可能担負特改組擴充以市長爲委員長秘書長各局</p>
<p>局長均爲委員並聘任湯濟滄·瞿宣頴·趙正平·三人爲專任委員於昨日下午一時在市府禮堂舉行成立大會市長主席</p>
<p>大會秩序　（一）全體肅立（二）唱黨歌（三）向國旗黨旗及總理遺像行三鞠躬禮（四）主席恭讀總理遺囑（五）靜默三分鐘（六）主席致詞（七）演說（八）散會</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席張市長致詞云今天本市通志館籌備委員擴充成立本席第一要說明的這件事是本市很重要而値得紀念的事有的人說修志這件事在本市尚非急要因爲本市開府尚無深長的歷史又有人說修志這件事僅供文獻的保存和參考好像非關實用又有人說本志的區域係就上海寳山兩縣分劃出來這兩縣志均出版於民國成立以後此時相隔未久似無很多材料可另行采輯又有一說江蘇省通志聽說也預備上海特編本市修志似可無須另辦這幾說都似有若干的理由但都没有見到本市修志重要的所在關於第一說本市修志非保存本府的文獻乃係集合本市的文獻與本府歷史的久暫没有關係第二說修志不求美觀須求實用這不獨現代人所應有的認識就是從前學者對修志事很有心得的章實齋先生也曾說過第三說上海寳山兩縣志均因襲歷來志書的老例所有新時代種種表現出來的事實可以說全没有顧到全没有蒐羅這也許是限於一縣的財力未能求全責備第四說江蘇省係中央直轄的政區本市也是中央直轄的政區江蘇省通志中之不應列入本市志等於浙江省通志中之不應列入本市志但他方面關於上海志之編修與否係另一問題而本市志之必須編修則責任所在無可旁貸關於以上幾說的錯誤旣已說明現在要說到本市修志之重要理由了要說這重要理由不能不先說國史的價値我們開口講中國係四千年文明古國然四千年文明古國的證據安在不能不說有六經爲證又有二十四史爲證然龔定菴先生說六經爲周史之宗子那麽一句話講起來中國之所以能稱爲四千年文明古國就因爲有四千年國史的緣故所以國體雖有變更而國史却未中斷因爲國史未中斷所以我們才可稱得起四千年古國的國家現在淸史和民國開國史雖然尚未經國民政府的編審公布然而國民政府對於這兩史早晚總得着手的我們便應該在國民政府着手編製民國史以前積極去編纂地方志爲甚麽呢因爲地方志是國史取材的唯一重要根據這種理由也曾經龔定庵章實齋等幾多學者說過的所以龔定庵說孔子與左邱明如周獲百二十國之書而後春秋作而司馬遷之網羅天下放佚舊聞以作史記也不能不根據春秋國語諸書那麽今天各省市之編修地方志就是爲今後編修國史的基礎尤其是上海一市論經濟上的地位爲全國第一商埠論政治學術的地位數十年來常爲全國的先驅論革命的地位也不知道經過多少人的努力和犧牲纔有今日的成績本市之有無詳明適用之市志與否於國史編定之關係非常重大再就目前的需要而論取銷不平等條約爲本黨確定的重要黨綱租界的收回僅屬時間問題市民對於本市及特區縱横方面情形乃是必須知道的常識不獨市民凡關心全國的經濟全國的文化全國的社會問題的人對於上海市亦須有深切的研究而供給這種研究的鉅著决非私人調查所能辦到亦非私人著述所能詳盡因爲有這種重要理由所以須設通志館在通志館成立以前尚有許多應行事項所以本市政府有設置市通志館籌備委員會的必要本席及本府秘書長各局長均參加本會爲當然委員以期各就職掌範圍供給資料此外更聘湯濟滄·趙正平·瞿宣頴·三位先生爲專任委員三位對於史的修養均甚豐富對於本市縱横兩方情形又極明瞭前途進行必能使我們滿意愉快再關於修志問題個人還有一點感想有人說修志一事不能過於求速的像百年前修一部松江府志用了多少人的精神尚且要經過五六年而一部安徽省志則經過五十餘年始成又江蘇通志自從前淸末葉設置專局以後先後及二十餘年迄今尚由江蘇省政府繼續其事所以過於求速是不可能的不過近人袁道冲先生之編修膠澳志雖前後採訪也費了一二年工夫而自着手編纂以至成書前後不過四閱月固然膠澳係新開的都市没有深長的歷史然編纂者成功之速殊足令各省修志人員可驚可佩所以本席很希望本會各委員人人以負責的精神將通志館應行籌備事項如期完成令通志館可以早日成立正式編纂本市通志使本府對於全市以及全國的文明有極大而且極快的貢獻這是本席最所深盼的</p>

<p>蔡福林述被綁經過</p>
<p>辯論終結定期宣判</p>
<p>英美烟公司買辦蔡福林於前年三月十四日被綁匪在愛文義路哈同路附近綁去以三萬元贖出迨後捕房緝獲綁匪章鴻祥金昌壽·張金生·張錢氏·陳吳氏·等數名口經特區法院審訊判决章鴻祥等處死刑餘人均處徒刑張錢氏無罪陳吳氏無期徒刑後捕房方面對於張錢氏在匪窟送飯確有知情帮助之嫌不服原判提起上訴而陳吳氏亦延律師聲明上訴昨日在高等法院開庭訊審</p>
<p>張錢氏　據張錢氏供二十二歲鎭江人住上海膠州路七號張金生爲其姘夫前夫於十八年四月廿六已死姘張不到一年與章鴻祥並不認識緣張錦堂之女滿月其姘夫偕往吃酒經張錦堂之妻要求在其家帮忙家事故當時住有五天之多斯時錦堂之妻謂有軍界友人病在亭子間内託其每日送飯每次祗送在扶梯旁邊並未進内惟曾往晒台上晒衣時見一人睡在床上對於綁案不知云云</p>
<p>陳吳氏　陳吳氏供與金昌壽有</p>
<p>親誼緣金向夏姓曾借欵三千兩又五千元由其夫做中保因過期不還夫不至松江乃往大東旅館索債當時祗聞金昌壽對張錦堂說蔡福林很有家財約有二三十萬可以想想法子惟此語祗從旁聽得並未與議分到贓欵等事完全無有實因曾爲討諓事與金昌壽相駡將老介福和楊慶和等處之摺子止住往來以</p>
<p>致有仇而被誣攀等辭</p>

<p>調解經過</p>
<p>江裕輪此次發生怠工風潮詳情已誌前報惟起</p>
<p>事原因蓋因總局將水手頭目調職天津服務引起工人誤會疑爲撤職乃向工會請願保留而局方因命令已發形難更改因此發生怠工風潮當時總局得信後即派南棧視察主任劉震副主任喬崧仁及北棧視察主任徐嵩岳前往海員工會幾次交涉方始諒解惟局方爲維持威信起見已暫允上船服務答復工會秘工人認爲語氣浮泛深恐中途變更故請杜月笙君出任調解結果認爲滿意該輪旋於當晚將碼頭所堆積貨物一律裝艙到次早八時開駛出口云</p>

<p>— 瘦羊</p>
<p>▲我無可譽而人譽之足增我之愧我有可譽而人譽之是足長我之驕</p>
<p>▲替情人做事時處處小心謹愼但結果未必討好替朋友做事時便是隨意爲之結果未必是壞</p>
<p>▲過去的事不要以爲旣往不追問心無愧若在淸夜思之多少總得些良心上的責備</p>
<p>▲笑聲出於自然的人其樂彌永出於勉强的人其苦彌深</p>
<p>▲自己未娶妻子的時候每艶羡人家夫婦的快樂到了自己娶了妻子以後反而有多少苦痛說不出來</p>
<p>▲久在黑閣環境下的人們要想走到光明之路終不可能因爲現在這種惡劣的社會不易改良</p>
<p>▲戀愛固然是神聖的是靑年男女所不免的要知道在未戀愛以前當念戀愛以後的目的如何及失戀時的痛苦如何</p>
<p>▲顧道德與顧廉恥的人决不肯爲非作惡因爲道德和廉恥是禁人作惡的藩籬</p>
<p>▲百無聊賴的當兒得了情人的安慰信有如飲了甘醴反之等於飲酖足以制死而有餘</p>
<p>▲不論什麽事頭緒愈多愈亂借了一筆債巴不得利息愈少愈輕</p>
<p>▲名譽和金錢兩相比較果然名譽敵不過金錢但是愛惜名譽的人决不受金錢籠絡而損失了名譽因爲名譽不是金錢所能買到的</p>

<p>— 蘇君</p>
<p>極度的神經弱衰使我開始對都市厭倦起來了擠在人擁的街車裏腦子昏眩着胸部透不出氣來心像要嘔出來啊</p>
<p>—到西湖去住些時候吧病了眞的病了在街車的震蕩中我自己這樣想回到屋裏告訴給海和鄒它們對我震驚了「好玩啊」鄒跳起來說「突然地又想起到西湖去了這個時候西湖還很冷寞啊」</p>
<p>「你」海說「你都市的禮讚者啊你又去禮讚自然了啊」</p>
<p>「我是病了啊」我回答它們「因爲我太離開自然了我要去自然的懷裏受一受撫慰我要逃避喧囂冷寞是於我有用的啊」</p>
<p>「那末你眞的就决定要去嗎」它們問</p>
<p>「是的」我答「而且明天就去」</p>
<p>它們因震驚而靜默了</p>
<p>早上海送我上了車</p>
<p>「喂」海向我說「你去如果你說西湖住着比上海好哩我也要跟來呢」</p>
<p>「但是」我說「西湖太詩了我並不願在那裏長住我不過讓我的腦精淸靜一下讓較新的空氣撫慰我一下我仍舊會回來的我不能離開都市因爲我不能離開人間的實生「活啊」</p>
<p>車快開了海下去一回又轉來送給我一把香蕉和一份報祇車於是蠕動了我握了握海的手「再見海」再見上海</p>
<p>五個鐘頭的行駛車到了城站了</p>
<p>將行裝卸在一家旅館之後我去看一看西湖了啊西湖已經春天了蘇堤的柳樹綠了湖濱公園的遊人都穿了單薄的夾裳了……</p>
<p>穿過白堤經過國立藝專的門口有琴聲從牆頭跳出靑年女學生散步着她們是値得驕傲的啊我急速地從她們旁邊走過使不讓她們知道我在俞樓找到了許君</p>
<p>「呵」許君奇怪地喊「你怎麽來了</p>

<h3 id="e23">Closing of the All India Congress <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>At this All India Congress, the Wen Gangan Agreement was peacefully passed, and Gandhi was publicly elected as the chief representative to attend the Second Round Table Conference, and was granted the power to formulate a Federal Constitution. Finally, a resolution including the eleven points advocated by Gandhi was passed as the formal definition of complete independence. All Indians cheered and dispersed, not only without unexpected disturbances as expected beforehand, but also striving to carry out the work of independence in the future. It is truly sufficient to see that the Indians have a pure will and strong ability. First, the Indians can unanimously believe in their leader and believe in his advocacy, and give him full power to attend the Round Table Conference without any wavering. Even Nehru, who is known as the most radical, gladly gave him sympathy. Small details beforehand were abandoned and ignored. This is one of the difficult things. Second, according to the telegram, the comrades of the National Congress will engage in the work of organizing the Federation to replace their previous non-cooperation movement, hoping to achieve the right to complete independence, and its policy will still focus on economics and politics. It can be seen that the spirit of Indian independence has always been consistent, the steps have always been unwavering, and the means have always been neither humble nor arrogant. This is the second difficult thing. I believe that the most worrying thing in the world is the lack of a leader with firm advocacy and unwavering despite all difficulties. There is such a leader, but there is no people with firm will and unwavering faith in their leader and obedience to the leader's advocacy despite all difficulties, then things will not succeed. There is such a leader and such a people, and I have not yet seen anyone who is afraid of being hindered. I use this to predict the future of Indian independence.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 31st: Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, Central America, was destroyed by an earthquake today. The first urgent telegram received in New York came from Panama City, stating simply that Managua had been destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake and that the few buildings that had not collapsed were now on fire. Soon, undersea cables and wireless transmissions followed, some of which were contradictory. However, according to the latest reports, approximately one thousand people died in the earthquake. The earthquake occurred suddenly at 10 AM this morning and lasted for a very short time. Buildings</p>

<p>Shook violently and collapsed like pieces of paper. One wireless operator, after escaping to a radio station five miles outside the city, issued a report stating that a major fire was spreading rapidly west from the market area, and that buildings not destroyed by the earthquake would be completely destroyed by the fire. It is estimated that thousands of people, including Americans, have been injured. The British and American embassies have both been reduced to ashes, and none of the Nicaraguan government offices have survived. Most of the banks and commercial firms have also been destroyed. The dead and wounded are scattered throughout the streets. American sailors stationed in Managua are bravely rescuing people from the rubble. After receiving news of the disaster, President Hoover immediately ordered the American Red Cross to begin planning relief efforts, and the Navy Department also ordered four warships to proceed to Nicaragua as quickly as possible. Two transport planes carrying doctors and medicine were also ordered to fly from Balboa to Managua immediately. The American aircraft carrier Lexington is currently steaming at full speed from Cuba to the east coast of Nicaragua at Puerto Cabezas, from which it will dispatch planes carrying doctors and medical supplies to Managua. Further reports indicate that American sailors in Managua are rescuing the injured without regard for their own safety, and have saved many lives. Only one hospital was not destroyed by the earthquake, and American naval doctors and nurses are treating hundreds of injured people in this hospital. The newly built presidential palace, located on a mountain peak overlooking the entire city, stands untouched.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Nicaraguan Capital City, 31st: This city has suffered a terrible earthquake. Within four minutes, there were ten violent tremors. Most of the tall buildings collapsed immediately, followed by a fire in the commercial district that spread rapidly. The streets are blocked and the water pipes have burst. Although the Nicaraguan volunteers and the US Army and Navy are doing their best to put out the fire, the fire has not subsided. The entire city is now under a cloud of smoke, and the cries of women and children searching for relatives are difficult to describe. The number of dead and injured is not yet known, but it is expected that at least 500 people have died and 800 have been injured, which can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. The US Embassy has been reduced to rubble, but fortunately no one was injured. However, many Americans in the city must be trapped in the rubble. Food is scarce, drinking water is polluted, and epidemics are a concern, and urgent relief is needed. There is no news from other cities and towns outside the capital due to blocked transportation, but it is believed that the disaster situation must also be serious.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 1st: According to the latest wireless transmission, the total number of victims of the Managua earthquake appears to have reached 2,500. A New York Times reporter stationed in Balboa reported that 1,100 bodies have been recovered. A collapsed prison has buried 150 inmates, all of whom have been killed. Another earthquake occurred at 9 PM last night, which was not violent, but not light either. If it were not for the fact that many officials and 40% of the city's residents were on the beach celebrating their Easter holidays, the death toll would have been even higher. The earthquake damage is limited to one area, but the entire city must be rebuilt. The fire is still raging today. One area has just been extinguished and another area is already alarming. The US Marines are currently assisting in the implementation of martial law. Anyone found looting will be shot on the spot. It was originally planned to blow up the building of the Anglo-South American Bank to stop the fire and avoid extending it to densely populated areas, but it was abandoned because the walls of the building were shaking and it was very dangerous to bury explosives. The bank's vault contains $550,000 in gold. The buildings of the Anglo-Central American Bank and the West Indian Oil Company have been reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 1st: The estimated losses from the Managua earthquake are currently estimated at US$35 million, most of which will be borne by British insurance companies.</p>

<p>Work to Facilitate Federation Begins</p>
<p>Disturbances in Cawnpore Gradually Subside</p>
<p>Reuters, Karachi, 1st: The All-India Congress closed late at night, with cheers echoing throughout the town. The Congress unanimously passed a resolution including Gandhi's famous eleven-point proposal, which formally defined India's complete independence and demanded that the governments of Indian princely states should have various fundamental rights. The proposal contained various detailed provisions, such as the abolition of the salt tax, exchange rate and currency policy, and the management of military spending, as well as a reduction of at least half of government spending, the limitation of industrial workers' salaries, the policy of excluding foreign yarn and protecting Indian self-woven cotton cloth, the total prohibition of alcohol, and the limitation of civil servant salaries to 450 pounds. Gandhi said that even the governor-general should not receive more than 500 rupees per month under a self-governing system. The above points are the demands that the All-India Congress must put forward when reopening the Round Table Conference. The final meeting lasted a long time because the chairman stated that a resolution could only be made after Muslims and Hindus who had left to worship had returned to the meeting place.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Karachi, 1st: This morning, more than 30,000 representatives set off to return to their homes, while Gandhi will remain here for a week. According to the results of this four-day meeting, the most important achievement was the acceptance of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the public recommendation of Gandhi as the chief representative to attend the second Round Table Conference in London in order to create a constitutional organization for an all-India federation. In the future, comrades of the National Congress will also be engaged in the work of forming a federation instead of its non-cooperation movement. However, while accepting the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, it was still declared that the purpose of the Congress was to achieve complete independence and to attempt to obtain the management rights of national defense, diplomacy, finance, and economic policy. According to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, comrades of the National Congress can continue to boycott foreign cloth and foreign alcohol, and those living on the coast can also make their own salt. However, the background of its future policy will be mainly economic and secondarily political. It can be seen that after this session, the situation in India has undergone a major change.</p>
<p>Reuters, Karachi, 1st: The All-India Congress today elected 15 members as the "Cabinet." The committee, or "Cabinet," includes Gandhi, Nehru, and Mrs. Naidu, with Patel as the chairman. They will probably represent the All-India Congress at the new Round Table Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cawnpore, 31st: The situation here is gradually calming down. Military patrols have been slightly reduced, but residents are concerned that epidemics will break out and that riots will resume, so many are moving to other places. Important markets have not yet opened. It is reported that several Muslims in a nearby village were killed and some houses were destroyed. The authorities have sent additional police to the affected villages to suppress them strongly.</p>

<p>Health Has Not Fully Recovered</p>
<p>Many Rumors Are Spreading</p>
<p>Saionji Moves to Tokyo</p>
<p>Japanese Political Situation May Undergo Changes</p>
<p>Decision Made to Issue Earthquake Disaster Bonds</p>
<p>Non-Debt Policy Reveals Flaws</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition has not worsened greatly since then, he did not receive Hara Osamu Jiro, an advisor to the Minsei Party, when he visited this morning. He has absolutely refused to meet with outsiders for the past two or three days, and various rumors about the Prime Minister's condition have been attracting attention.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: Prime Minister Hamaguchi's health remains poor. He has not attended a single cabinet meeting, and all government affairs have been delegated to other cabinet members. The Seiyukai Party has been criticizing the Prime Minister for failing to fulfill his responsibilities to assist the Emperor, and even the elder statesmen and the Privy Council are giving this considerable consideration. In particular, Prince Saionji, who usually retires to his villa in Okitsu after the Diet session, has uniquely moved to Tokyo this year, perhaps anticipating that the political situation will undergo major changes due to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's health problems. In short, the political situation has secretly become very tense.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: Foreign Minister Shidehara visited Prince Saionji at 4 PM today to report on government affairs in the Diet, but his main purpose was to explore Saionji's views because Prime Minister Hamaguchi's recovery was not as expected and government affairs were piling up. Depending on Saionji's views, the political situation may undergo major changes.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The Ministry of Finance decided yesterday to issue earthquake reconstruction bonds to make up for the 45 million yen shortfall in the 1930 fiscal year budget, in accordance with the Earthquake Reconstruction Public Bond Act and accounting regulations. The 1930 earthquake reconstruction project expenditure was 40 million yen, and 6 to 7 million yen were incorporated into the 1929 budget. The government had previously adhered to a non-debt policy and therefore paid for it from general revenue. Now, due to insufficient revenue, this portion of bonds is being issued. However, Seiyukai Party members had strongly pursued this matter. At that time, Finance Minister Inoue replied that it was not yet clear whether there would be a revenue shortfall and that it was not possible to make an assumption and answer accordingly. However, judging from this bond issuance, the mask has been completely stripped away, proving that the government's response was completely false, and the Hamaguchi cabinet's non-debt policy has been exposed as flawed.</p>
<p>South American Countries Suggest the League of Nations</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 31st: The League of Nations recently received a joint letter from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, South American countries, which is quite difficult to answer. Although the Secretariat is extremely cautious about this matter, it is known that the letter from the three countries requests that all countries joining the League of Nations establish a Department of Peace to work alongside the current Departments of Military Affairs and that the duties of the Department of Peace would be to prepare and implement all disarmament matters. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations has now notified all member states of the gist of the letter.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 31st: The British fiscal year ended today. Last April, Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden predicted a surplus of £2,236,000. Not only is there no surplus, but there is a shortfall of £23,275,000. Total annual income was £775,894,000, and total expenditure was £799,170,000. Such a large difference in national income and expenditure has not been seen since 1927. The current shortfall has been made up by borrowing. However, part of the shortfall is not accurate. £11,430,000 has been overpaid into the reserve fund, so the true shortfall is only £11,845,000.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Munich, 31st: The National Socialist Party, in accordance with the orders of Mr. Hitler, today sued the government in the Supreme Court in Leipzig for illegally issuing emergency decrees temporarily suspending certain constitutional freedoms in order to curb the political movements of extremists, saying that such orders have no constitutional basis and therefore cannot be effective.</p>

<p>Spreading Leaflets Inciting Military Discontent</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st: Sixty-nine people in Osaka accused of carrying out a communist conspiracy will be publicly tried in the Osaka District Court on April 7. These people were arrested in February last year when the police authorities investigated the Communist Party. Newspapers have only been allowed to report it today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st: It is learned that last year, hundreds of leaflets bearing the name of the Japanese Communist Party were spread in factories near Osaka, and one person was arrested after a strict interrogation. As a result, a large number of seditious pamphlets were found in his residence, which were intended to organize a new Communist Party at the time of the general election. On February 16, these pamphlets were again found in the barracks of two infantry regiments, and 150 people were arrested. Three people were also arrested at a certain place, and they seriously injured three Japanese police officers while resisting arrest. It is reported that some of those arrested used pistols, swords, and other weapons to fight against the police.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Cause of the British Airship Disaster <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Report Released</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 31st: The British government's tribunal, after thoroughly investigating the case of the British largest airship R-101, which exploded and crashed in France after striking a mountain on its way from London to India on October 4 last year carrying the Minister of Aviation, etc., today released its report, which is 120 pages long. The report states that the cause of the accident was due to a large amount of leaked gas, but it is currently difficult to determine exactly how the gas leaked. It is likely that the gas bags had slight tears after the airship fought against severe wind and rain. The report does not hold the crew responsible for the accident, but it says that the trial flight time was still insufficient and that it was inappropriate to travel to India for no reason other than publicity. The report does not comment on the future of airships, saying only that their use is still under experimentation.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Telegram <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Nanchang: To all newspapers: Jiangxi Province has suffered from banditry for many years, with thousands of miles of fertile fields turning into desolate wastelands. The villages are empty and only ashes remain after robberies. The seizure of cities and land is even more severe than before, leading to utter destitution and widespread displacement. Having been dispatched to Jiangxi, I have recently investigated and found that large armies are gathered in various counties, gradually recovering them. The counties affected by the disaster include Yongxin, Yunhua, Anfu, Ninggang, Wanzai, Duchang, Fengwan, Yongfeng, Dexing, Yiyang, Anyuan, Huichang, Chongyi, Ganggu, Wannian, Shanggao, Yifeng, Xingguo, Xiushui, Le'an, Leping, Yundu, Taihe, Ruijin, Fenyi, Shangrao, Xunlang, Xiufeng, Yichun, Wuning, Xingan, Shicheng, Xinyu, Dayu, Suichuan, Shangyou, Guangchang, Yushan, Fuliang, Xiajiang, Jishui, Ji'an, Qianshan, Pingxiang, Gao'an, Yujiang, Yihuang, Guixi, Qingjiang, Poyang, Chongren, Nanfeng, Hukou, Pengze, Ruichang, Fengxin, Nankang, Nancheng, De'an, Lichuan, Guangfeng, Zixi, Xingzi, and other counties. The disaster area is vast, covering almost the entire province with countless wounds, which is heartbreaking. The disaster has persisted in dozens of counties, which is truly the most severe in the country and unprecedented in history. Although we are urgently trying to remedy the situation, the reserves are depleted, and the people are deeply impoverished, which is not something that can be solved by small amounts. We need everyone's support. Your esteemed newspaper has the duty to uphold public opinion and promote the disaster situation in Jiangxi Province as much as possible, so that the focus of the disaster in the country will be shifted to Jiangxi, and the survivors after the catastrophe will be bathed in the warmth of spring. We are truly grateful for your kindness. We hereby send this telegram to Chen Weixi, for your information and guidance. Bao Shouyin, Hong Benli, and Xu Guozhi, Inspectors of the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government.</p>
<p>Telegram from Wenzhou: To Shenbao and all the Money Trade Associations in major cities: Your newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance has revised the Business Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, changing the taxation of the Money Trade to 10 per mille of the capital amount, which has caused panic among the people. We recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance: We have investigated that the current standard for classifying business taxes and collecting tax rates in Zhejiang Province stipulates that the Money Trade is taxed at 2 per mille of the capital amount, and we have heard that the Ministry has revised it to increase it to 10 per mille, which is shocking. We believe that banks and money houses both belong to financial institutions and are both industries that support commerce. Their business does not deal with goods, so there has never been a tax on them in the past. And since the banking industry has been specially exempted from business tax, the Money Trade should also be exempted by analogy. How can the Ministry fail to investigate clearly and intend to tax the Money Trade at 2 per mille of the capital amount, and the Ministry's revision is even more severe, with rumors of increasing it to 10 per mille? We are all confused and frightened. If the rumors are true, the Money Trade will suddenly increase its burden and will inevitably be weakened and decline, which will greatly affect the merchants and people. We dare not to take the liberty of sending a telegram requesting the Ministry to investigate and verify, and earnestly request that it be exempted according to the precedent of banks, so as to show fairness and security to the business community. We are extremely anxious. The Money Trade Association of Yongjia bows." This matter concerns the vital interests of the Money Trade, so we implore everyone to uphold justice. We anxiously await your response. The Money Trade Association of Yongjia bows.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Bandits in Baoduguo Are Being Encircled and Suppressed <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>General Offensive Order on April 1st</p>
<p>A communication from Jinan states that Han Fuqu is determined to eradicate the long-standing bandits in Baoduguo. In addition to using his own divisions to vigorously suppress them, he is also coordinating with friendly troops in Shandong to implement a large encirclement. Han himself has also gone to the front line to command. As of today (the 30th), he is still in Qufu. It is reported that the bandits in the area are divided into three groups: (1) Sun Meisong, the brother of Sun Meiyao, who robbed the train in Lincheng, has a group of about 3,000 people entrenched in the Baoduguo stronghold; (2) Yin Shigui has a group entrenched in Mengshan with about 3,000 people; (3) Wang Baichuan has the smallest group with only a few hundred people entrenched in Julingguo, which belongs to Linqu County. The 74th Division, under Qiao Lizhi, is currently encircling and suppressing the bandits with seven battalions. The bandits are stubbornly resisting on the mountain, relying on the terrain, and there are frequent fierce battles. The first gate of Julingguo has been blown up by the 74th Division's artillery. The bandits on the mountain rely entirely on the water source at the first gate for drinking water. Now that it has been blown up, the bandits are quite frightened, and some have already surrendered. The bandit area is a continuous series of mountains, and the northern part is particularly difficult to attack because of the numerous mountains and valleys. Therefore, the strength of the troops suppressing the bandits is the strongest in the Boshan area. Han Fuqu himself is serving as the commander-in-chief, with the 3rd Route Army as the main force. Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division, Lei Taiping's Pistol Brigade are responsible for Sishui, Mengyin and Fei counties, Zhan Shutang's 58th Brigade is responsible for Yishui, Cao Fulun's direct troops of the 29th Division and Qiao Lizhi's 74th Division are responsible for Linqu, and Ning Chunxiao's 64th Brigade is responsible for Boshan. Cao Fulun is responsible for commanding the northern route (Qingzhou, Linqu, Yishui, Boshan). On the side of the friendly troops, Ma Hongkui's cavalry is in Teng County, Wang Jun's 7th Division is in Lincheng, and Chen Yaohan's 26th Division is in Linyi. All the troops suppressing the bandits have reached their destinations and are carrying out reconnaissance. It is reported that a general offensive order will be issued on April 1 to jointly suppress the bandits in order to eliminate them completely.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Qingdao Merchants' Strike Has Not Been Resolved <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Another Petition to Party and Government Authorities</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The strike of Qingdao's local product merchants has lasted for more than ten days without any sign of resolution. On the 28th, at 2 PM, the merchants united and held a large-scale petition with approximately 700 representatives. Each person held a small flag and marched in formation, shouting slogans of petition along the way. They first arrived at the Municipal Party Headquarters, where four petition representatives, Liang Heping, Chen Bingjin, Zhang Yanzhan, and Shen Ziyi, met with Hou Shenglin, the Municipal Steering Committee member, and presented four requests: (1) Send another telegram to the Central Government urging approval of the merchants' demands. (2) Request the Commodity Inspection Bureau to temporarily grant exemption from inspection and fees, and also send a letter to the Jiaohai Customs to allow passage. (3) Goods shipped to Hong Kong should not be treated as foreign trade. (4) The Commodity Inspection Bureau should declare that the revenue collected from merchants should be used for the benefit of merchants. They questioned the purpose of last year's income of more than 300,000 yuan. Committee Member Hou replied that the first item could be handled accordingly, and the remaining items would be discussed and handled jointly with the Municipal Government and the Inspection Bureau. After the representatives withdrew, they reported the petition situation to the public. The entire group then went to the Municipal Government, where the representatives met with Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng to explain their intentions. Mr. Hu also promised to work with the Party Headquarters to find a proper solution. On the one hand, he would send another telegram to the Central Government; on the other hand, he would negotiate with the Inspection Bureau to request temporary exemption from inspection and fees. He also advised the public not to go to the bureau to petition, to avoid causing trouble. Subsequently, Yang Jinsheng, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the front of the Municipal Government to persuade the public, stating that the Party and government authorities would definitely find a way to resolve the issue as soon as possible, to eliminate the merchants' suffering and achieve satisfactory results. The merchants, satisfied that the Party and government authorities had accommodated their demands, then returned in formation. When passing by the Commodity Inspection Bureau, they shouted various slogans. The Public Security Bureau, fearing an accident, had already dispatched dozens of armed police officers to the vicinity of the bureau to maintain order, so no incident occurred. The merchants also printed and distributed an open letter to all sectors, requesting unified support (the full text is omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e78">Guangdong Rice Merchants Resist Anhui Province's Rice License Tax <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>If It Is Not Abolished, They Will Purchase From Vietnam and Siam</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Anhui Province's recent collection of rice license taxes has affected Guangdong Province's rice supply. The turmoil has not yet subsided. The Guangdong rice merchants have stopped purchasing Wuhu rice for many days. In February alone, the Wuhu rice merchants were forced by the Anhui government to pay rice license taxes of approximately 200,000 yuan. After the local rice merchants strongly protested, the collected rice tax was handed over to the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce for temporary preservation, pending resolution by the Central Government. However, the Anhui Provincial Government still used force to compel payment of the tax within five days, and the rice purchased by the Guangdong merchants has been detained. Therefore, the Guangdong rice merchants specially sent representative Li Mengzhuang back to Guangdong to report the turmoil and the current stalemate to the Guangdong Rice Bran Association and the Grain Association. The two rice and grain associations held a meeting on the 23rd, during which Mr. Li attended and reported on the current situation of the rice tax. He stated that when he set off to return to Guangdong, the Anhui government had given the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce five days to hand over the preserved tax money. Furthermore, Guangdong rice ships would not be allowed to leave until the case was resolved. Upon hearing the news, the colleagues of the Rice and Grain Association were indignant and immediately decided to purchase rice from places such as Vietnam and Siam instead. If the Anhui rice license tax is not abolished, Guangdong Province will never purchase Anhui rice. On the one hand, they sent another telegram to Chen Diaoyuan, the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, urging him to quickly abolish the rice license tax and not impose restrictive levies. On the other hand, they telegraphed the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce to return the preserved tax money to the rice merchants or be responsible for its safekeeping and not allow powerful individuals to take it away. The two telegrams were sent out on the 24th. The original text is excerpted as follows: (1) To Chairman Chen of the Anhui Provincial Government: The collection of export license fees for rice in Anhui Province has been repeatedly ordered to be abolished by the Executive Yuan. However, the Wuhu Rice License Bureau still forcibly collects them and even prevents transportation, which is confusing. The collection of rice license fees hinders the agriculture and commerce of your province and affects the food supply of neighboring regions. Our public party and country have entrusted us with heavy responsibilities and should consider this. If there is an urgent need, it seems appropriate to seek other solutions. It should be known that rice is essential for people's livelihood. Imposing harsh levies sets a bad precedent that is difficult to eradicate and will be criticized by future generations. Yangcheng nurtured Jin and was clumsy in collecting taxes, while Duke Huan dominated Qi and even prohibited hoarding. Constitutional decrees and virtuous reputations are everlasting. We hope that you will consider this carefully and do good, benefiting not only the people of Anhui and Guangdong. We earnestly implore you and await your orders. (2) To the Guang Zhao Public Institute and the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the rice license case, please persevere to the end and await resolution by the Central Government. Any payment of license fees on behalf of others will not be recognized. The tax money preserved by your association must not be taken away. Our association has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, strictly ordering a stop to the collection and approving the return of the preserved money by the Chamber of Commerce. Respectfully, Guangdong Rice Bran Industry Association and Grain Industry Association (March 25th).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Shantou Municipal Government Mediates Foreign Shipping Company's Price Increase Case <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Price Increase Issue Will Be Fundamentally Resolved</p>
<p>The Travel Association's Patrol Team Is Removed</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The foreign shipping companies in Shantou monopolized the Singapore and Southeast Asian routes, which was resisted by all sectors. The Travel Association issued a notice to all inns and dispatched partners to form 18 patrol teams, each with 28 members, to take turns monitoring the land and sea checkpoints, prohibiting those going to Southeast Asia from boarding the ships of the foreign shipping companies. However, there were no fewer than a thousand passengers waiting in Shantou for ships to Siam, which caused great anxiety. The Shantou foreign shipping company agents then lobbied the inns to send passengers to board their ships, reducing ticket prices, providing special treatment for tea, water, meals, and dishes on board, and advising passengers to petition the Municipal Government to remove the patrol teams. On the 26th, more than 300 overseas Chinese going to Siam petitioned the Municipal Government. The organizers of the petition group were the Pu Ning Gang Inn, the Tai Feng Jieyang Gang, the Tong An Chaoyang Gang, the Mao Xing Nan Cheng Chaoan Gang, and the De Li Xing Chenghai Gang. Each invited dozens of passengers going to Siam and requested Luo Yunjie, Xu Zonghao, and Lin Guoying, the three directors of the Shantou Overseas Chinese Federation, to represent them and go to the Municipal Government to petition. The main points of their petition were: "The Travel Association, on the pretext of the foreign shipping companies increasing the price of tickets to Singapore, has jointly resisted the ships going to Siam that have not increased prices, and has dispatched armed patrols to guard the coast, causing partners to dare not send passengers and passengers to dare not disembark freely. A few days ago, Yuanli increased the ticket price to Annam by two yuan per passenger, but passengers could still board freely. Why are the Siam ships subject to unreasonable restrictions? We are forced by livelihood to go to Siam to make a living. If we are delayed for a long time and wait for the turmoil to resolve, once our travel expenses are exhausted, we will inevitably have no funds to buy tickets or be unable to pay taxes upon arrival in Siam, hindering our employment and leading to a desperate cry. We are about to exhaust our travel expenses in Shantou. In any case, we must board the Zhangjiakou and Xialishi ships on the 26th to go abroad." At that time, Mayor Zhang received the representatives and, after learning the details, immediately issued a hand decree ordering the foreign shipping companies not to increase the price of tickets to Singapore, maintaining the original price of 36 yuan per passenger. At that time, representatives of the Anti-Price Increase Committee also arrived at the Municipal Government, advocating for a further reduction of 5 jiao, while representatives of the foreign shipping companies demanded an increase of 2 yuan, i.e., 38 yuan per passenger. The dispute was only between 2 yuan and 5 jiao, which should not prolong the turmoil. Subsequently, Mayor Zhang issued another hand decree ordering the opposition committee to quickly remove the armed patrol team and not to prevent overseas Chinese from boarding ships to Siam, and ordering the Public Security Bureau to send police officers to advise the Travel Association groups that the price increase of ship tickets to Singapore was being mediated, and if the ticket prices to Siam had not increased, the sub-associations should not uniformly resist, hindering overseas Chinese from going abroad. At this point, the petition group felt satisfied and returned to their hotels. That afternoon, the Travel Association's patrol team also withdrew from the customs, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched police to patrol the streets along the coast. All slogans were also torn down, and the hotels sent the overseas Chinese to the Zhangjiakou and Xialishi ships that afternoon, which set sail for Siam that evening. However, in order to seek a complete solution, the Municipal Government convened representatives from the Anti-Price Increase Committee and the foreign shipping companies again on the morning of the 27th to find a fair solution as soon as possible (27th).</p>
<h3 id="e80">Taiyuan Dismisses Various Agencies <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi's military reorganization is still unable to proceed due to a lack of funds for demobilization. The provincial government has recently engaged in the dismissal of political agencies. In addition to the Ordnance Factory, which has already laid off more than 2,000 employees, the provincial government decided yesterday to dismiss the Village Administration Office, Statistics Office, Tax Administration Office, Drama Improvement Association, and Political Examination Committee, as they do not comply with the central government's legal requirements. They will be taken over by the Provincial Finance Department and the Civil Affairs Department. The Financial Restructuring Office, the Party and Government Academy, the Model Propaganda Institute, and the Shanxi Political Report will be scaled down and temporarily retained. After the implementation of this decision, the number of unemployed officials in Taiyuan will increase considerably.</p>
<p>In recent days, the sharp decline in provincial currency has affected the people's livelihood, causing extreme panic. As a result, rumors have spread, and the people's hearts are uneasy. Fearing that unscrupulous individuals will disrupt local security, the authorities have increased the number of joint military and police investigation teams in addition to the existing garrison troops to carry out defense. Therefore, Taiyuan remains relatively peaceful. Regarding the request of teachers and staff from various schools for salary payments, the association issued a declaration yesterday, stating that if the authorities fail to understand, they will have no choice but to resign collectively and seek other means of livelihood. Judging from the current situation, it is feared that a teaching strike will eventually occur, which is also a problem of great concern in Taiyuan (March 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Shanxi Provincial Antiquities Exhibition <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Exhibiting Antiquities From 5,000 Years Ago</p>
<p>Unique Types, Approximately Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi archaeologists Wei Juxian and others excavated many antiquities last year at the Han Fenyin Houtu Temple in Wanquan County, southern Shanxi. Now, Mr. Wei and others, for the convenience of the public, have organized and cataloged the various items and opened an antiquities exhibition at the Confucius Temple Library. The exhibition began on the 27th, and many people came to visit. The exhibition has various explanatory signs and photographs posted on the walls, and Wei Juxian himself is present to guide visitors. The antiquities occupy two rooms, inner and outer. The items displayed in the outer room were excavated from the Jingcun Waza slope in Wanquan County and are all coarse and fine pottery from 5,000 years ago, such as jars, bottles, pots, women's earrings, hairpins, and bone tools. The items displayed in the inner room were collected from Xidu Village and Yanziyi Pagoda near the Han Fenyin Houtu Temple in Wanquan County. Most of them are coarse and fine pottery from 2,000 years ago, with bricks and tiles being the most numerous. The large tiles are about two or three feet long and one or two feet wide, painted with Bagua (eight trigrams), Taiji (yin-yang symbol), and other patterns. The clay is solid, the patterns are exquisite, and the names are numerous, which are rare in the world. There are approximately tens of thousands of objects, large and small. Among them, the most peculiar is a male reproductive organ made of pottery, about two or three inches long, with the glans and urethra as lifelike as the real thing. According to its label, ancient people worshiped male reproductive organs the most, so they made this object from pottery and displayed it in their homes as an ornament. As for the Han Fenyin Houtu Temple, it was built in the fourth year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (Yuanding). At that time, many members of the imperial family lived there, so the actual noble items were exceptionally numerous. Later, the Han Dynasty declined, and most of the items were buried underground. The items excavated today are probably of this kind (March 27th).</p>

<p>Zou Shangyou Is Internally Appointed as Secretary-General</p>
<p>Hu Ruoyu Will Accompany Him to Beiping</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the Central Government officially announced Zhang Xueming as the Mayor of Tianjin, Mr. Zhang telegraphed requesting the withdrawal of the order, humbly declining the position. However, the Central Government, recognizing Mr. Zhang's meritorious service in solving major cases during his tenure as the Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, telegraphed him to stay. Mr. Zhang then went to Tianjin to take office on the morning of the 28th and set the date for the oath of office on April 1st. Mr. Zhang also stated that there would be no major changes in the personnel of various agencies. It is said that the position of Director of the Public Security Bureau will be given to Lu Lu, the Director of the Tianjin Second District. The position of Secretary-General of the Municipal Government was once internally designated for Zou Shangyou, the newly appointed Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but Mr. Zou is very busy handling budget matters at the Eastern Railway, and it remains to be seen whether he can take the position pending Zou's consent. The former Mayor of Tianjin, Zang Qifang, was transferred to the position of Director of the Land Bureau in the Harbin Special District and has already taken office. Before taking office, he went to Shenyang from Harbin to take the oath of office as the Special Commissioner of Harbin and then went to Tianjin the next day (27th) to handle the handover of the Tianjin Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau. The position of Director of the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau will be concurrently held by Wang Jiarui, the Director of the Tianjin Land Bureau. Mr. Wang returned to Tianjin with Mayor Zhang on the morning of the 28th to take over the position. Hu Ruoyu, the Mayor of Qingdao, arrived in Shenyang with Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, to pay respects to Mr. Zhang. After that, Mr. Hu suffered a slight cold due to fatigue along the way and rested briefly in Shenyang. After participating in the inauguration of the Party Committee, he will travel to Tianjin with Zhang Xueming and then go to Beiping to take office as the Mayor of Beiping and prepare for the Cultural Committee (March 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e83">Japanese in Yanbian Consolidate Their Defense <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Based on Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The Conspiracy of Aggression Is Increasingly Exposed</p>
<p>World Society Shenyang Correspondence: The Japanese are carrying out various conspiracies to invade the Northeast in all aspects, including diplomacy, military affairs, and industry. There are countless undisclosed plans. Recently, they have become even more aggressive. Their military plan in the border area has been detected by our Yanbian authorities. The Japanese have always regarded the so-called Jiandao as their sphere of influence in that area, meaning it is located between China and Korea. According to the maps made by the Japanese, Jiandao includes the Yanbian area, such as Longjing Village, Juzi Street, Toudaogou, Baicaogou, and the plains north of the Tumen River. The Japanese manage this area based on the so-called Jiandao Agreement signed on September 4, 1909. According to the content of the agreement, there are five articles: (1) The Tumen River is the border. (2) Open Longjing Village, Juzi Street, Toudaogou, and Baicaogou as commercial ports. (3) Korean farmers should be allowed to live north of the Tumen River. (4) Japanese people have the freedom to do business and reside in the mixed-residence area north of the Tumen River. (5) Extend the Jichang Railway to connect with the Huining Railway in Korea. The Japanese use this unequal treaty to manage Yanbian, and their influence has now far exceeded the scope of the treaty. The so-called Jiandao has become a Japanese colony in an invisible way. The Japanese have established a police agency to govern the people of Yanbian, treating our country's sovereignty as nothing for a long time. In the past one or two years, the movement of the people of the Northeast to recover national sovereignty has been rising. Various anti-Japanese groups have been established in the Jiandao area. Our country's military police also hate the Japanese invasion, and there have been repeated conflicts with the unreasonable Japanese police. The killing of Japanese police in Jilin last year was one example. In view of this, the Japanese very much want to send troops to</p>

<p>garrison the area. However, this action is related to international relations and they do not dare to openly carry it out. Therefore, they have increased their defense on the border in order to take advantage of opportunities. The total number of Japanese police stationed along the approximately 200-mile-long border line from the Yalu River to the Tumen River has reached 12,700, with the establishment of gun emplacements, observation towers, airfields, and wireless and wired telegraph stations. There are also shallow-water destroyers patrolling the Tumen and Yalu Rivers. Even on the opposite bank, which is under the jurisdiction of our country's sovereignty, the Japanese police openly have resident offices. Our side endures and retreats, and does not dare to establish police agencies along the riverbanks to avoid conflicts, which has caused the Japanese arrogance to intensify and act recklessly. It is truly lamentable.</p>

<p>Zhu Xi, the General Supervisor of the National Assembly elections in Anhui Province, has decided to rush through the election procedures by the end of April and has ordered all counties to submit the list of voters to the province by April 1st. After receiving the order, the Wuhu County Government has limited the deadline to the 29th to receive the lists of various groups for transmission.</p>
<p>Wuhu has a Wuhu Taoist Education Association jointly organized by 23 counties in southern Anhui, with land and public funds. After the establishment of Wuhu City, a City Education Association was also established. Now, the County Party Headquarters believes that since the city has not yet been realized and the Taoist organization has been abolished, the organization of the two associations is illegal. It has been decided to abolish both associations and take them over separately.</p>
<p>Gui Chongji, a member of the Central Committee, came to Wuhu to inspect party affairs. He has been going to party headquarters at all levels and various groups and schools for several days to investigate. He will complete his work and go to Hefei on the 31st to inspect. After a few days, he will return to Wuhu and take the Jinpu Railway to inspect Bengbu and other places in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>Bai Baoshan and several staff members and guards passed through Wuhu from Beijing yesterday to Anqing to meet with Chen Diaoyuan to discuss important matters.</p>
<p>The small steamers operating in Wuhu, Nanjing, Anqing, Datong, and other inland rivers, such as Taichang, Taifeng, Da'an, and Xiehe, six companies, pay special attention to the business of the Jingwu line. Recently, the original Daxin Company suddenly dispatched ships to operate between Jingwu. In order to compete for business, each company also dispatched small steamers to operate exclusively on the Jingwu line. The fare has been reduced from one yuan to three jiao. Fearing that it would cause accidents, the military and police authorities sent a team to suppress the situation on the riverfront (March 29th).</p>
<h3 id="e85">Wu Tiecheng's Speech on the Northeast Under Japanese and Russian Aggression <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association recently held a banquet for Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee, and his staff at the Fanyang Youth Association, and invited Mr. Wu to give a speech. Mr. Wu spoke on "The Northeast Under Japanese and Russian Aggression." The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>"Chairman, comrades, today I am honored to receive such a warm reception from the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association. I, on behalf of my colleagues, express my deep gratitude. I have been to the Northeast several times. Every time I go to the Northeast and come into contact with it, the Northeast gives me a better impression, more understanding, and deeper understanding. This impression, understanding, and understanding not only make me feel a closer relationship with the Northeast, but also often make me more patriotic, especially the kind of concern and attachment to the Northeast. Why? Because the Northeast is the most important gateway to northern China, and it goes without saying that the products are abundant. Just taking the international relations alone, the Northeast also occupies a very important position. Since the Northeast stands in such an important position, it is naturally and naturally particularly closely related to China's national defense and economic survival. Simply put, everything that happens in the Northeast often involves the safety of the entire China and makes people not forget to care about the Northeast, feeling that the Northeast has a close relationship with themselves. Therefore, when I came to the Northeast to comfort the army on the order of the Central Government last time, I issued two slogans after returning from Jihai: "I don't know how great China is until I go to the Northeast, and I don't know how dangerous China is until I go to the Northeast." This is because of this reason. However, there are some people who are insensitive. They have always only known one end of the pros and cons and do not know the other end of the pros and cons. They can only see the economic oppression of the imperialist initiators and cannot see the various oppressions of the imperialists other than the economy. This problem is especially serious among the people in Guannei because they can only see the imperialists bringing various things to exchange for our money every day, and they don't feel any personal relationship with the rest. But the Northeast is very different. In addition to money, there are also political oppression, military oppression, and various other most profound and humiliating oppressions all gathered in the Northeast. It can be said that this is the most severely oppressed place. Therefore, the people of the Northeast feel the pain of the imperialists' aggression particularly deeply, and their patriotic enthusiasm is far more ardent than that of the people in Guannei. Every morning I wake up, open the window, and look out, I feel my spirit excited, also because I feel that the claws of the imperialists are all unfolded in front of me. Therefore, the people in Guannei, no matter how negligent they are of the imperialists' aggression, will immediately feel the personal interests of the people in the Northeast outside Guannei. Under this kind of restraint, under this kind of oppression, it is a natural result that no matter what kind of person feels excited. From this point of view, it can also be seen that the patriotism of the people outside Guannei is more enthusiastic than that of the people in Guannei. What's more, the people in Guannei already know that they are about to reach the point of direct contact with the imperialists. We can imagine by looking at the establishment of the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association. Just now I heard the chairman say that the establishment of the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association was initiated when the people of Liaoning with lofty ideals felt the urgency of foreign aggression during the last Red Russian disturbance in order to make the people of the whole country pay attention to the issue of the Northeast. In other words, it was established in accordance with the Prime Minister's instructions that in order to seek freedom and equality for China, we must awaken the people. Therefore, the greatest proposition of the National Diplomacy Association is to seek freedom and equality for China, that is, to make the whole country pay attention to the aggression of the red and white imperialists in the Northeast and to seek freedom and equality for China. I often see in the newspapers that your association has done a lot of extremely consistent work, which makes me very admire and agree. Unfortunately, I have never had much material on international diplomacy to contribute to you, and some of them cannot be announced frankly, which is a great regret. Now, regarding the aggression of the red and white imperialists, I will briefly announce some of what I know, which can also be used as a reference for your association.</p>
<p>The Northeast has vast land and abundant products. Therefore, when the current great powers' population problem and capitalism have already reached a state of saturation, there is not an imperialist who does not want to open a new road to the Northeast and benefit from the Northeast, just like the former four-country loan group also wanted to enter the Northeast to share the benefits. However, at that time, Japan, for its own vital interests, joined forces with Russia to suppress the four-country loan group, and in the end, the four-country loan group stopped from then on. Now, the southern part of the Northeast is oppressed by white Japanese imperialism, and the northern part is invaded by red Soviet Russian imperialism. And the sinister policies of these two imperialists had already been arranged by the Russian Foreign Minister Sakonov and Japanese Katsura Taro in the era of the Russian emperor through a secret agreement to divide the so-called Manchuria and Mongolia. Later, after the October Revolution in Russia, although it announced the natural abandonment of all unequal treaties, it still traditionally inherited the aggressive policies of the imperial era towards the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia and has not changed its attitude in the slightest until now, just like the incident on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Not only did they not fulfill the treaty, but in the end they had to use force to oppress China. They also disregarded Article 5 of the outline signed in May of the thirteenth year and still controlled Outer Mongolia. Are these things the attitude that a so-called revolutionary socialist country should have? In fact, there is not a single difference from the imperialist capitalist countries. Not only are they using the Chinese Eastern Railway as a base for propaganda and redification, but in order to invade the Northeast, they are also trying their best to buy off bandits and hooligans in China to disrupt China's public security and destroy China's peace, so that the areas such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, which have always been known for their richness, have been messed up. This shows the sinister intentions of Red Russia. The reason why China cannot start construction now is because the bandits and hooligans, reactionaries, and so-called communists bought by Red Russia have disrupted China's public security and made the people of China uneasy (To be continued)</p>

<p>Major Fire on Tonghui Road: More than thirty grass sheds located between Tonghui Road and Tongqin Road, behind the First Stage, mainly inhabited by Jianghuai merchants, were destroyed by fire. Fan Jinbiao, a night watchman, resided in shed number thirteen. Around 5:30 PM the night before, a fire broke out suddenly and unexpectedly. Due to strong winds and dry weather, the fire spread rapidly. In less than half an hour, more than thirty grass sheds were completely burned down, also affecting the Xixingli Xincheng Xu sand factory workshop to the left, the Shuntaixing iron shop outside Tongqin Road. Furthermore, sixteen workshops rented by Xixing Company in Xixingli were also damaged in the front. Fortunately, Xiangtai Company had fire insurance. Other households also suffered significant losses. During the fire, a Jiangxi man named Huang Youcai seized the opportunity to steal a cotton quilt but was discovered. He was handed over to the police of the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and three papers with symbols were found on him. His confession was vague, and he has been sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Provincial Order Approves Exemption from Donation for Self-Organized Feasts: After the levy of the Wuxi feast education donation began, restaurants collected the donation on behalf of the government and were able to report and remit the funds accurately. However, chefs hired for private events were affected and refused to acknowledge the donation, which affected tax revenue and hindered the business of restaurants. Restaurants petitioned for relief one after another. The county government's finance bureau jointly reported to the provincial government for instructions. Yesterday, the provincial government issued a directive stating that henceforth, households holding weddings, funerals, or celebratory events, who can clearly prove that they have a resident chef and organize the feast themselves, are permitted to be exempt from the donation. If hiring a chef, regardless of the size of the feast or whether purchasing ingredients themselves or contracting the chef, the chef should be responsible for collecting the donation in accordance with regulations to prevent evasion and maintain business operations. Director Zhuang of the Finance Bureau will separately communicate the directive for compliance.</p>

<p>Qingxiang Bureau Explains Difficulties in Various Aspects: Long Tiyao, inspector of the Jiangsu Provincial Qingxiang General Bureau, discovered the following three difficulties during his inspection in Zhenjiang: (A) Regarding the investigation of household registration, the investigation of vagrants is very important, but the standard for vagrants is actually difficult to determine, and there is great difficulty during the investigation. (B) Regarding the joint guarantee and pledge, (1) if a person has committed theft in the past, but there is no improper behavior now, he should not be investigated for his past according to the law, but the neighbors on the left and right are unwilling to guarantee him because of this relationship, how should it be handled? (2) if someone has just moved in from another place and has no relatives or friends and lives in a thatched hut (most of these people work hard), and no one dares to guarantee him, what should be done? (C) Regarding defense and suppression, if the general corps members are injured or killed while suppressing bandits, there are no fixed compensation or medical expenses. If this continues, no one will dare to continue their efforts. The General Bureau should set a specific method for compensation. The above difficulties were reported to the General Bureau for instructions. Because it was important, the General Bureau immediately clarified and notified all counties to comply. The original text of the explanation is recorded below: (A) A vagrant should be someone who has no occupation, no family, and no fixed residence. (B) 1. If there are such people in any township, the township chief should inspect them at any time, and the neighbors should report their behavior to the township chief for investigation. 2. They should be ordered to find two or more people to guarantee them, otherwise they will not be allowed to build a house to live in. (C) Before the regulations on commendation and compensation by the Department of Civil Affairs are formulated and implemented, the counties should consider the budget for the security corps and handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Discusses Business Tax Issues Again: The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce believes that the issue of the business tax rate in Jiangsu Province and the issue of each county's chamber of commerce contracting to collect the tax is of great importance. In addition to sending letters to each county's chamber of commerce, inviting representatives to come to Zhenjiang today (the 1st) to hold a meeting to discuss it together, it also convened the third temporary meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss the opinions on the revised business tax rate and contracting to collect the tax. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The seven principles agreed upon by the representatives of each county in Zhenjiang last time, except for the second and third items, the Chamber of Commerce should still ask each representative to continue to strive for the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh items. (2) The two principles that the collection period in the inland should not be earlier than Shanghai and the tax rate should not be higher than Shanghai should be given special attention by each representative. (3) The Chamber of Commerce believes that contracting to collect the tax is actually difficult to implement, and the Department of Finance should send personnel to collect the tax itself.</p>
<p>Chief of the Fifth Public Security Bureau Dismissed: The General Bureau discovered that Ma Yuebo, chief of the Fifth Public Security Bureau, was extorting illegal fees from the Tianchan Stage. The General Bureau sent inspectors to wait and watch in the area and obtained conclusive evidence. In addition to dismissing the messenger and sending him back to the bureau for interrogation, the chief of the bureau was dismissed to show a warning, as he was extorting illegal fees. In addition, Liu Kebi, the captain of the bicycle team of the bureau, led the police to Paiwan to inspect and extorted money from the villagers under the pretext of being on duty. The General Bureau also discovered this, detained him, and brought him to the bureau. Because the case was serious, in addition to dismissing him, the captain and four subordinates were sent to the court for handling according to law.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We are writing in reference to the news item in your March 30 Ningbo dispatch concerning the rebuilding of the two bridges in Ningbo. It stated that our company's engineer, Mr. Ansber, along with a prominent Shanghai businessman, inspected the two bridges in Ningbo, and suggested that the new Jiang Bridge should be moved to Lujia Daotou and the old Jiang Bridge should be moved to Dahuantou, and that the new bridge should be an automatic swivel bridge, and the construction cost of the two bridges would be about one million yuan. This is slightly inaccurate. Our company's Mr. Ansber was only commissioned to make a preliminary inspection of the existing bridge bodies and the river surface. He did not make any statements about the location of the new bridge, the style of the new bridge, or the cost. Your newspaper's Ningbo dispatch was the result of a misunderstanding. Our company is afraid that the rumors will be inaccurate and cause misunderstandings. We are writing this letter to correct the record and request that it be published in your newspaper's letter column. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e103">Ji Da Issues Notice to Overseas Chinese Students Returning Home for Attention <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang-Americas Culture Department of Ji Da recently issued a notice to overseas Chinese, directing Nanyang-America各报馆各商会各书报社各公共圑体 to forward information to students and parents returning home to study. The notice states that the school was founded in Nanjing and moved to Shanghai. Over the past 20 years, it has spared no effort in planning and implementing overseas Chinese education. As a result, more and more overseas Chinese students are coming to study. The department is affiliated with the school and is responsible for communicating with overseas Chinese. In view of this situation, we are all very happy. However, many students overseas are not familiar with the situation in the interior, so they arrive at different times, making it very inconvenient for students to study abroad. Therefore, we will briefly outline the new regulations of the Ministry of Education and the school's enrollment regulations as a general guide for those returning to study. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has been working hard to rectify public schools, and has set fixed regulations for holidays and exam periods. It has also unified the enrollment process, with one exam held every year during the summer vacation, except for special circumstances. Since our school is a national school, it cannot be an exception. Our department has been reporting to overseas elders about overseas communication for many years. However, many overseas students are too eager to go to school and do not have time to consider the exam period. Not only do they come to the school during the annual holidays to request admission, but the timing of their return is also inconsistent. It is very inconvenient to refuse them, as it is a pity to deny them the opportunity to study. However, accepting them would disrupt the regulations. After repeated consideration, we deeply feel that the previous accommodating measures were originally a temporary expedient. If they continue to be extended, they will greatly hinder the school's administration and facilities. Therefore, the recent school affairs meeting has repeatedly stated that new students will be admitted in accordance with the school's regulations. June 24 is the registration date, and July 6-8 is the exam date. Applications will be rejected before the exam date and no exceptions will be made after the exam date. We hope that students returning from overseas to study will make preparations early and arrive in Shanghai before July 1 to register and take the exam on time to avoid difficulties. We hereby announce this and wish you all the best.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Central Film and Cultural Propaganda Committee (Continued) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>(II) Promoting the Doctrine of People's Rights: For four thousand years, the Chinese people, ruled by the tyranny of the imperial system, have devoted their lives to serving the emperor and lack understanding of the rights and obligations that citizens should enjoy. Fortunately, thanks to the clarion call of the late Premier Sun, the people were awakened and knew that the world belonged to the people and was not the private property of one family or individual. However, the hidden power of warlords and local tyrants has not been eliminated, and the people still lack understanding of the doctrine of people's rights under repeated oppression. This is all due to a lack of propaganda. The only plan for now is to make films that compare the disadvantages of the people's abandonment of their rights with the benefits of people in other countries using their rights to imply the difference. First, let the people know, and then they can act. There has never been a case of someone knowing they have rights but not wanting to enjoy them. The problem is that they do not know.</p>
<p>(III) Promoting Nationalism: A nation has its own special status, and a nation has its own special culture. Therefore, land, people, and culture are the three major elements of nation-building. Our country's land is shrinking, the people are declining, and the culture is collapsing. The country will cease to be a country. How can we continue to fail to improve ourselves? The lessons of the past, such as India's resistance to Britain, Korea's resistance to Japan, and Morocco and Annam's resistance to France, are all deeply affected by the brutal rule of other nations. All those with blood and qi are heartbroken and resentful. Therefore, there is this final struggle for the people. Moreover, our nation has long been under the invasion of various imperialisms and is in imminent danger. If we still do not vigorously promote nationalism to give the general public a considerable nationalistic ideology, then in the future, when the government faces a diplomatic emergency, the people will be driven by nationalism in their hearts and will unite into a strong and powerful rear. Its power should not be ignored. However, this kind of effect can only be achieved through film propaganda. (To be continued)</p>

First, Mrs. Chu Minyi performed the opening ceremony, and then guests, faculty, alumni, and students of the university entered the auditorium in an orderly manner. After Principal Zhu Jiahua's report, Yu Hongjun delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Zhang, saying that at a time when people's livelihoods are declining, it is necessary to seek the development of industry, and the development of industry must start from studying business and commerce. The School of Commerce aims to cultivate business talents and is the fundamental way to alleviate the people's livelihood. Wang Xiaolai said in his speech that the past failure of China's commerce was due to merchants' lack of research in commercial studies. Now, your school's in-depth research in commercial studies has truly created a bright path for our business community. From now on, we can work together to revitalize China's commerce. Chu Minyi said in his speech that the School of Commerce should find ways to connect with the business community so that what is learned can meet the needs of the business community. Ye Huijun's speech focused on cultivating morality, which was exceptionally insightful and moved everyone who heard it. In addition, there were also speeches by the representative of the Education Bureau, Cen Dezhang, the president of Tongji University, Hu Shuhua, and representatives of faculty, alumni, and students of the school.

<p>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram Urging Strict Warning</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that it had been approved by the Taiyuan Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The telegram opened by stating, "Since our country promulgated an order in February of the 18th year of the Republic (1929) to abolish consular jurisdiction from January of the 19th year (1930), among the countries with consular jurisdiction in China, apart from those that will voluntarily abandon it or re-negotiate agreements due to the expiration of treaties, only six countries are still in negotiations. According to reports, since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note last December, among the six countries, the Netherlands and Norway have expressed their willingness to negotiate the abolition, Brazil is also willing to consider it, and the United Kingdom and the United States absolutely agree. It is clear that these countries have sincerity in abolishing consular jurisdiction and are gradually reaching a consensus. Only France, regarding negotiations on our legal rights, is still following the old pattern, delaying and ignoring it, and not providing a sincere response to our Ministry's note. Moreover, the French envoy's trip to the capital has been repeatedly delayed. Such deliberate delay is tantamount to disregarding our national sovereignty and abandoning friendly relations. A country's judicial system is a matter of internal affairs, and other countries have no right to interfere. Today, in the world, whether large or small, only China is bound by consular jurisdiction. Now that the National Government is determined to restore sovereignty and abolish consular jurisdiction, all compatriots across the country should vow to fight to the death to support the government and not give up until the goal is achieved. We urge you to unanimously support the National Government's diplomatic policy of abolishing consular jurisdiction and promote its realization in the shortest possible time. We share a common hatred and strongly warn France not to respect our national sovereignty. This emergency telegram cannot express our extreme indignation." Signed: Taiyuan Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Upon receipt of this, we are sending this telegram to your government and departments for review. We earnestly request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be swiftly instructed to conduct serious negotiations with France to protect our national rights. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, with seal.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Establishment of the Shanghai Gazetteer Hall Preparatory Committee <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Grand Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Government established the Preparatory Committee for the Municipal Gazetteer Hall in June of the year before last to compile the city's gazetteer. Mayor Zhang appointed the directors of the Education, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus to undertake the work. Due to the heavy workload of the committee, which could not be shouldered by a few people, it was reorganized and expanded. The mayor serves as the chairman, the secretary general, and the directors of each bureau are members. Tang Jicang, Qu Xuanjing, and Zhao Zhengping were appointed as full-time members. The inaugural meeting was held at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 1:00 PM yesterday. The mayor chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) All stand at attention. (2) Sing the Party song. (3) Bow three times to the national flag, the Party flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. (4) The chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will. (5) Three minutes of silence. (6) Chairman's speech. (7) Speeches. (8) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Mayor Zhang said, "Today, the Preparatory Committee for the Municipal Gazetteer Hall is expanded and established. The first thing I want to explain is that this matter is very important and memorable for our city. Some people say that compiling a gazetteer is not an urgent matter for our city because our city has not had a long history. Some people say that compiling a gazetteer is only for the preservation and reference of literature and seems to be unrelated to practical use. Some people say that the area of this gazetteer is divided from Shanghai and Baoshan counties, and the gazetteers of these two counties were published after the establishment of the Republic of China. It seems that not much material can be collected separately since the time interval is short. There is also a saying that the Jiangsu Provincial Gazetteer is also preparing a special edition for Shanghai, so it seems unnecessary to compile a separate gazetteer for our city. These statements all seem to have some reasons, but none of them have seen the importance of compiling a gazetteer for our city. Regarding the first statement, compiling a gazetteer for our city is not to preserve the literature of the Municipal Government but to collect the literature of our city. It has nothing to do with the length of the Municipal Government's history. Regarding the second statement, compiling a gazetteer should not seek beauty but seek practicality. This is not only the understanding that modern people should have, but also Mr. Zhang Shizhai, a scholar who was very knowledgeable about compiling gazetteers, once said. Regarding the third statement, the gazetteers of Shanghai and Baoshan counties all follow the old examples of previous gazetteers. All the facts manifested in the new era can be said to have been completely ignored and not collected at all. This may be due to the limited financial resources of a county and the inability to seek perfection. Regarding the fourth statement, Jiangsu Province is a centrally-administered administrative region, and our city is also a centrally-administered administrative region. The Shanghai section should not be included in the Jiangsu Provincial Gazetteer, just as the Zhejiang Province section should not be included in the Jiangsu Provincial Gazetteer. However, the issue of whether or not to compile the Shanghai Gazetteer is another matter, and the need to compile a gazetteer for our city is a responsibility that cannot be shirked. The errors of the above statements have been explained. Now I want to talk about the important reasons for compiling a gazetteer for our city. To talk about this important reason, we must first talk about the value of national history. We often say that China is an ancient civilization of four thousand years, but where is the evidence of the ancient civilization of four thousand years? We must say that there are the Six Classics as evidence and the Twenty-Four Histories as evidence. However, Mr. Gong Ding'an said that the Six Classics are the descendants of the Zhou History. So, to put it simply, China can be called an ancient civilization of four thousand years because it has four thousand years of national history. Therefore, although the national system has changed, the national history has not been interrupted. Because the national history has not been interrupted, we can be called a country of four thousand years of antiquity. Now, although the Qing History and the founding history of the Republic of China have not yet been reviewed and published by the National Government, the National Government will eventually begin working on these two histories sooner or later. We should actively compile local gazetteers before the National Government begins to compile the history of the Republic of China. Why? Because the local gazetteer is the only important basis for selecting materials for the national history. This reason has been said by many scholars such as Gong Ding'an and Zhang Shizhai. Therefore, Gong Ding'an said that Confucius and Zuo Qiuming wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals after Zhou obtained the books of 120 countries. Sima Qian's net to gather old news from all over the world to write the Historical Records also had to be based on the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Guo Yu. So, today, the compilation of local gazetteers in various provinces and cities is the foundation for compiling the national history in the future. Especially Shanghai, in terms of economic status, is the first commercial port in the country. In terms of political and academic status, it has often been the pioneer of the country for decades. In terms of the status of the revolution, I don't know how many people's efforts and sacrifices it took to achieve today's results. Whether or not there is a detailed and applicable city gazetteer in our city is very important to the compilation of national history. Furthermore, in terms of current needs, abolishing unequal treaties is an important party program determined by our Party. The recovery of the concessions is only a matter of time. Citizens must know the horizontal and vertical aspects of our city and the special zone. Not only citizens but also people who are concerned about the national economy, national culture, and national social issues must have an in-depth study of Shanghai. A great work that can provide this kind of research can never be done by private investigation or described in detail by private writing. Because there is this important reason, it is necessary to establish a gazetteer hall. Before the establishment of the gazetteer hall, there are still many matters that should be carried out. Therefore, the Municipal Government has the need to establish a preparatory committee for the municipal gazetteer hall. It is natural for me and the Secretary-General and directors of each bureau of the Municipal Government to participate in this committee to provide information within the scope of our respective duties. In addition, we have appointed Mr. Tang Jicang, Mr. Zhao Zhengping, and Mr. Qu Xuanjing as full-time members. The three gentlemen are very knowledgeable in the study of history and are very familiar with the horizontal and vertical aspects of our city. We will surely be satisfied and happy with the progress in the future. Regarding the issue of compiling a gazetteer, I personally have one more thought. Some people say that the compilation of a gazetteer should not be too fast. It took many people's efforts to compile a Songjiang Prefecture Gazetteer a hundred years ago, and it still took five or six years. It took more than fifty years to complete the Anhui Provincial Gazetteer. The Jiangsu Gazetteer has been in progress since a special bureau was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government is still continuing its work. Therefore, it is impossible to be too fast. However, Mr. Yuan Daochong compiled the Jiaozhou Gazetteer in recent times. Although it took one or two years to interview, it took only four months from the start of compilation to the completion of the book. Of course, Jiaozhou is a newly opened city without a long history. However, the speed of success of the compiler is enough to surprise the gazetteer personnel of each province. Therefore, I hope that all members of this committee will complete the preparatory matters that should be carried out by the gazetteer hall on schedule in a responsible spirit, so that the gazetteer hall can be established as soon as possible and officially compile the city's gazetteer, so that the Municipal Government can make a great and rapid contribution to the civilization of the city and the whole country. This is what I deeply hope for."</p>

<p>Due to Lack of Notification from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the abolition of likin, the regular customhouses within 50 li have not been abolished. The Ministry of Finance only recently issued an order to abolish them. The Jianghai Customhouse has had a regular customhouse within 50 li in Nanshi for a very long time. The annual tax revenue is about one million yuan. According to an important official of the Customs, the Jianghai Customhouse has not yet received a formal order from the Ministry of Finance, so the Nanshi Customhouse is still operating as usual. The closure will begin after the formal order from the Ministry arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Extension of Time Limit for Transportation and Sales of Existing Yarn and Cloth Approved for Another Half Month <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Consolidated Tax Office Yesterday Notified the Yarn Mill Federation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn Mill Federation previously requested an extension of the time limit for the transportation and sales of yarn and cloth stored before February 1 because it was feared that it could not be transported and sold as scheduled, and the Consolidated Tax Office granted an extension until March 31. Subsequently, in view of the sluggish sales and the pressing deadline, the Federation again requested the Consolidated Tax Office for a further extension. The Consolidated Tax Office replied that the Ministry's order did not allow for a further extension and should be complied with as scheduled. From April 1, all taxes should be supplemented, and four standards for supplementing taxes were stipulated: (1) Cotton yarn and its direct woven products manufactured before February 1 that have been shipped from the factory warehouse can be sold locally after April 1 without supplementing the consolidated tax. If they are transported from the location of the original yarn mill or weaving mill to other locations, they must pay the consolidated tax if they do not have a tax certificate when passing through the customs or inspection station. (2) Cotton yarn and its direct woven products manufactured before February 1 that have been shipped from the location of the original yarn mill or textile mill and have arrived at other locations through customs or inspection stations before April 1 can be transported to the interior of the country without supplementing the consolidated tax if the ownership does not belong to the original manufacturer (i.e., other inland areas that are not the location of the original yarn mill or textile mill). However, if the ownership still belongs to the original manufacturer, the consolidated tax must be supplemented (the customs duties that have been paid can be deducted from the consolidated tax) before they can be sold. (3) Cotton yarn and its direct woven products shipped from yarn mills or textile mills and warehouses storing goods from April 1, regardless of whether they are in stock or not, must pay the consolidated tax. (4) Cotton yarn direct products woven by hand from April 1 are allowed to be exempted from inspection of the consolidated tax certificate. However, if they are not made by hand and do not have a cotton yarn tax certificate and the cotton yarn used has not been inspected by the customs, the consolidated tax will still be levied. However, the Federation stated that due to the poor sales of silk in various factories and the heavy taxes levied by the customs, the number of existing yarn and cloth was still large. If the above regulations were followed, they would not be able to bear the burden. Therefore, they again described the difficulties to the Consolidated Tax Office and requested that a further extension be granted to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. Yesterday, the Consolidated Tax Office replied that it had been approved to extend the time limit by half a month, stating in the original letter, "Upon receipt of your Federation's letter of the 30th, stating that the tax-free sales limit for cotton yarn and its direct woven products in stock on March 31 has expired and that there is still a large amount of stock, please grant a further extension of one month. It has been approved by the Ministry to extend the time limit by half a month, etc., and should be complied with. In addition to separate orders, we are corresponding to inform you to check and inform all manufacturers to be aware."</p>
<h3 id="e128">North Shanghai Over Twenty Silk Factories Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Restoration of Original Wages</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Striking Workers</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, female workers from the Fengtai Silk Factory at No. 5 Yong'an Lane, West Dayang Bridge, Taiyang Temple, Zhabei, and the Qingfeng Silk Factory on Guangfu Road, went on strike first after their demand for the factory to restore the previous original wages was not met. Around 1 p.m., more than twenty female workers from factories such as Yong'an Silk Factory in the Xinzha district responded in unison and went on strike as a whole, totaling more than sixteen thousand striking workers. The situation is extremely serious. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike: Last winter, due to the sluggish silk market, various silk factories in this port negotiated with the workers to calculate workers' wages at 85% of the original rate. Once the market price of each dan of silk exceeded one thousand taels, the original wages would be restored. The longest limit was the end of May of this year. The workers temporarily accepted this without objection. Recently, the selling price of B-grade silk has been above one thousand taels, so the workers began to demand the restoration of the original wages. The day before yesterday afternoon, the Fengtai and Qingfeng silk factories distributed wages still calculated at 85% of the original rate. The workers immediately demanded the restoration of the original price. The factory side stated that the restoration of the price had to wait for the entire city to act uniformly. The workers expressed deep dissatisfaction. At noon yesterday, when it was time to open the factory for lunch, the workers of the two silk factories went on strike first and did not return to the factory. Each factory had more than eight hundred workers.</p>
<p>Response from Various Factories: Around 1 p.m., workers from more than twenty silk factories in the Xinzha District, including Fuchangrun at No. 351 Chang'an Road, Yong'an at No. 468 Meiyuan Road, Xiefeng Baokang at No. 85 Hengfeng Road, Chunmei, Yuanyuan, Longji at No. 799 Chang'an Road, Qichang at No. 530 Chang'an Road, Xie'an at No. 735 Guangfu Road, Tailai at No. 812 Chang'an Road, Baolun at No. 46 Yutong Road, Dingkang, Baisi 2 at No. 37 Hengfeng Road, Baisi 1 at No. 659 Guangfu Road, Dingchangshun, Hengchangxin at No. 246 Hengfeng Road, Shunfengyong at No. 555 Guangfu Road, Fumin at No. 238 Hengfeng Road, Xiechang, Xiexing at No. 225 Chang'an Road, Fuchangtai at No. 695 Chang'an Road, and Yongtaixing at No. 145 Guoqing Road, also responded in unison and went on strike one after another, totaling more than sixteen thousand striking workers.</p>
<p>Factory Precautions: After the labor unrest occurred in the above silk factories, other silk factories such as Hongchun at No. 116 Manzhou Road, Dekang, Lunyuan at No. 6 North Xizang Road, Baojing at No. 5 Wenjisi Tuo Road, and Xuxing, Xukang at No. 54 North Suzhou Road, were deeply afraid that the same incident would occur in their factories. They closed the factory gates and stopped workers from entering and leaving, so no unrest occurred. At 4 p.m., the North District Silk Reeling Industry Union of Zhaofeng Lane, West Baoxing Road, immediately issued an urgent notice advising workers not to strike on their own and to wait quietly for a solution. Therefore, workers from silk factories such as Zhenhe, Jintai, Zhenyu, Qingxiang, Tongli, Hongchang, Junsheng, Fuxing, Lunfu, Shen'an, Fengying, Yushi, and Changyu did not strike.</p>
<p>Management Meeting: After the labor unrest occurred, the silk factories immediately reported to the trade association and immediately held an emergency meeting to find a solution. As of 8 p.m., it was still not over. After the workers went on strike, there were no other actions. It is heard that the union will send representatives to negotiate with the factory to restore the original wages.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Beijing-Shanghai Fourth-Class Passenger Train Departed Earlier <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Slight Changes in Stops at Various Stations</p>
<p>Previously, the Beijing-Shanghai fourth-class passenger train departed too early and had to stop at every station, often arriving at the terminal station late at night. It is now heard that starting from April 1st, the third and fourth-class express train departing from Shanghai will depart earlier at 5:30 a.m. It will only stop at Huangdu, Kunshan, and Suzhou within the Shanghai-Wuxi section. The third and fourth-class express train departing from Nanjing will also depart earlier at 8 a.m. It will only stop at Suzhou, Kunshan, Anting, and Nanxiang within the Wuxi-Shanghai section. There will also be a third and fourth-class Shanghai-Wuxi regional train that stops at every station for passengers traveling between Shanghai and Wuxi, departing from Shanghai at 7:30 a.m. and from Wuxi at 2:30 p.m. This method is extremely convenient for fourth-class passengers. However, many fourth-class passengers are laborers, and some are illiterate. If the schedule changes, they may not know and may still miss the train. Factory staff and general employers should guide and announce to these workers at any time to fulfill their mutual assistance responsibilities. This can also be a way to care for laborers.</p>

After finishing, he returned to Shanghai on the Japanese ship Fengtian Maru. The ship could have entered the port on the 31st, but it encountered heavy fog when it departed from Qingdao and dared not take the risk, so it anchored in Jiaozhou Bay to wait for the fog to clear before proceeding, resulting in a one-day delay. It finally arrived in Shanghai at 3 p.m. yesterday. The Jianghai Customs had already sent a telegram to prepare a boat to welcome him at the Huangpu Wharf. Those who came to greet him had already prepared a car. Liu immediately returned to his Shanghai nest after landing. Japanese officials stationed in Shanghai, Saburo Fujito, also returned on the same ship.</p>

<p>Discussing the Lin-Sa-Qiu Case</p>
<p>The case of Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, and Qiu Zhenwu being arrested is related to the One-Six Fujian Mutiny. Some people are plotting revenge and falsely accusing them of being communists, and urging Chairman Yang to telegraph Shanghai to arrest them. Yesterday, naval ship captains, considering the feelings of their colleagues, elected representatives to visit them, but they were unable to meet them and returned disappointed. It is now heard that the ship captains have telegraphed and earnestly requested Acting Minister Dai to explain the situation, and also telegraphed Chairman Yang, stating that the three officers are military officers. If they have committed a crime, they should be transferred to the naval department for military trial to show credibility. The telegram from the captains of the ships stationed in Ningbo, Shanghai, and the Yangtze River to the Navy Minister Yang is recorded below: To Minister Yang of the Fujian Provincial Government: News reports state that Sa Fuchou, Lin Zhong, Qiu Zhenwu, and others are involved in the assassination of Zhang, and it is also said that they are communists who negotiated with the Japanese consul in Shanghai and were arrested on the Jiuri ship in Changsha and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention. We, the undersigned, were shocked and bewildered to hear the news. The captains of the ships stationed in Ningbo, Shanghai, and the Yangtze River have been sending telegrams to inquire about the truth. However, Sa and others are either naval generals whose military status has not been removed, or they have been following his command for many years. If they have committed a crime, the military law is in place. How could they be humiliated to this extent? We were confused and puzzled. Yesterday, we read the news and learned that the Fujian Provincial Government submitted a request to the Central Government to arrest Sa and others because they were suspected of conspiring with the One-Six Mutiny in Fujian Province. Your Excellency is well aware of this case. Yesterday, the captains of the ships went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request to see Sa and others to express our condolences and fulfill our comradeship, but the authorities refused, stating that they were ordered not to allow visits. We returned disappointed. We believe that Your Excellency leads the entire army and also leads the provincial government. All members of the entire army love and support Your Excellency, and Your Excellency will certainly protect them. The situation of Sa and others being arrested as reported has chilled the hearts of those in the military. Your Excellency must also have deep feelings. We hope that Your Excellency will immediately telegraph the Shanghai authorities to send Sa and others back to the navy for handling in order to protect the military's reputation and remedy the situation. We, the undersigned, are relying on Your Excellency's protection and are driven by loyalty. We dare not remain silent in danger. We deeply hope that Your Excellency will make a decisive decision and accept our loyal advice. We await orders with trepidation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transportation Industry Meeting <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Discussion on Remedies for the Railway Bureau's Increased Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transportation Industry Association, due to the Railway Bureau's 20% increase in freight rates on March 16, has been holding joint meetings of representatives from transportation industry associations at various stations along the entire line from April 1st to 3rd to address the various difficulties in freight and passenger transport caused by the increased freight rates and to request the ministry and bureau to consider reducing the increase. Yesterday (the 1st) was the first day of the joint meeting to discuss remedies. The joint meeting began at 10 a.m. The representatives entered the meeting to discuss remedies. First, Shen Huiquan, chairman of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Association, reported that the Railway Bureau's increase in freight rates on March 16 made train transport more expensive than ship transport for merchants. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line is different from other lines in nature. At present, it is in the midst of competition between water and land transport. Requests for lower freight rates were made at both the two-way business meeting and the Ministry of Railways business meeting. Now that the price reduction has not been implemented, the current increase seems to be out of touch with commercial sentiment, and merchants are increasingly switching to ship transport, especially for North-South goods, grains, and kerosene. The industry has suffered a loss, and the Railway Bureau's income has also been reduced. Therefore, representatives from the same industry were gathered today to discuss remedies. First, a comparison table of the difference in the number of freight transportations between train transport and ship transport will be submitted to the ministry, and the opinion letters submitted by the representatives will be discussed one by one. The result of the discussion is scheduled to be reviewed starting at 2 p.m. (today). The meeting adjourned at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>From April 11th to May 10th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued an announcement regarding the extension of the deadline for exchanging warehouse vouchers for housing rent loans for one month. The announcement stated that the exchange of tariff warehouse vouchers and municipal public bonds for housing rent loans in this city was completed on March 6th of this year. However, there are still many households who did not exchange their vouchers within the exchange period. The bureau has requested to apply for supplementary exchange. The bureau has received instructions from the Municipal Government No. 9619 that a one-month extension should be granted to allow the owners to apply for supplementary exchange. This should be complied with. It is now decided that from April 11th to May 10th of this year, all households holding housing rent loan certificates in this city who have not exchanged their vouchers must bring their chops to the bureau for supplementary exchange within the above-mentioned deadline and prescribed office hours, along with a notice to collect the vouchers from the bank. Please take note of this and do not delay further.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Result of Negotiation between Labor and Management on the Sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Total of 85,000 Foreign Dollars</p>
<p>However, Various Workers Expressed Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to handle the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road. The third mediation was convened at 1 p.m. yesterday. After a long period of consultation, it was learned that the labor and management had resolved the issue through oral negotiation. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Number of Attendees: At 1 p.m. yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened the third mediation of the three parties: Factory owner Sheng Zecheng, manager Sheng Yulin of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, Rong Zongjing, general manager of the Xin Xin Yarn Factory, and the Third Special District Cotton Textile Industry Union. Sheng Yulin sent a letter stating that he had resigned and would not attend. Zhu Guangcheng, the authorized representative of the shareholders of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, Rong Zongjing, the new buyer, also sent an authorized representative to attend. Tian Sanzi, Gu Lansheng, He Baojin, Hou Jiahai, and more than 20 representatives of workers from 18 departments of the factory attended the meeting on behalf of the Third Special District Cotton Textile Industry Union. Section member Xu Zhi chaired the meeting, and Zhu Guilin recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Mediation Situation: After a long period of inquiry by the chairman, it was learned that the labor-management dispute had been resolved orally by Sun Hecai, the general representative of the workers, and Zhu Guangcheng, the shareholder representative of the factory, through repeated negotiations. The factory will issue a total of 85,000 yuan to all factory staff and workers. Approximately 100 staff members will receive 60,000 yuan, and more than 4,000 workers will receive 25,000 yuan. The chairman said that since the matter has been resolved through negotiation, there is no need for further mediation.</p>
<p>Worker Dissatisfaction: Representatives of workers from various departments expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions made by the factory and the general representative of the workers. The reason is that when cooperating with the staff, General Representative Sun announced to everyone that if the negotiation results in a subsidy, staff and workers will be distributed equally. Now, each staff member can get 600 yuan, while each worker only gets 4.5 yuan. They believe this is unfair and demand a renegotiation. The chairman instructed the representatives to consult with General Representative Sun first to discuss the distribution plan. If a solution cannot be found, they can submit a request to the bureau. At the same time, he instructed the management representative not to make the payment before the distribution issue is resolved. The management representative Zhu Guang responded that the Social Affairs Bureau would be notified before the payment is made.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Prepares to Welcome</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that the Consul-General in Java reported that the Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies organized a business delegation to return to China on a regular basis. They were instructed to contact and entertain them. The original text is as follows: For the purpose of obedience, Consul-General Zhang Ming in Java reported that the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies stated that it is proposed to organize a business delegation of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies in view of the current high price of gold and low price of silver in order to develop Chinese-Dutch commerce. The delegation is scheduled to depart from Batavia on March 25th for Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Beiping, Liaoning, Dalian, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places for travel and inspection. He also hired the undersigned as a consultant and requested a three-month leave to accompany the delegation back to the country in order to provide guidance and facilitate contact. It is stated that the members of the business delegation are all major merchants of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies who are usually enthusiastic and supportive of the Party and the country. This return to the country for inspection is specifically for the purpose of developing Chinese-Dutch commerce. It is proposed to request your Ministry to check and consult with the provincial and municipal governments of the above-mentioned places of travel and instruct them to protect them properly. Based on this, the Law on Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Return to the Country to Run Industries was promulgated by the National Government in February of the 19th year. According to the report of the Consul-General that the Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are organizing a delegation to return to the country on a regular basis to inspect commerce, they should be properly protected and guided in detail. In addition to issuing instructions and consulting with the provincial and municipal governments of the places of travel to instruct them to comply with the above, it is hereby ordered that the Chamber of Commerce select various commercial items related to the Overseas Chinese inspection and other beneficial matters to encourage Overseas Chinese to start businesses, make preliminary plans, and contact and entertain them properly as soon as the Overseas Chinese delegation arrives. After receiving the order, the association has approved the transfer to the General Affairs Section and the Commodity Exhibition Hall to prepare in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e146">All Staff Members of the Anti-Drug Association's Executive Department Express Opinions on the Bai Case <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Standing Committee</p>
<p>Since the Bai Zhiying drug trafficking case was reported, all staff members of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association's Executive Department have not made any reports to the outside world because the truth of the case is unclear. However, due to frequent inquiries from all parties, all staff members have had to make a fair statement to dispel doubts. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the association's Standing Committee, advocating that public and private boundaries should be clarified and the truth should be investigated. The letter is excerpted below: "To Chairman Wang and all members of the Standing Committee: Since the Bai case occurred, the association has advocated that public and private matters should be clarified. The Standing Committee has resolved four important measures, especially the second measure, which states that 'Before the truth is clear, all internal and external affairs of the association will be jointly responsible by the four members designated by the Standing Committee, Wang Jingqi, Li Denghui, Zhong Ketuo, and Cai Rudong, and Chen Hongjun will be appointed as acting director-general.' This clear measure on the task of the former director-general is most important. We, the undersigned, believe that this is the only fair proposal and must always be thoroughly appreciated and not be tolerated or changed in the slightest. If the public and private affairs of this case are not clear and we listen to Mr. Huang and still come to the meeting and use the name of the entire association as a tool for personal expression, it will inevitably lead to misunderstandings from the outside world. We, the undersigned, have served for many years and are greatly concerned, and the life of the association is at stake. We hope that the National Government will immediately conduct a thorough investigation of the case. If the facts are true, the association should, in the spirit it has always held, earnestly request the National Government to deal with it severely in accordance with the law in order to maintain the association's inherent reputation. We hope that the public opinion of the entire executive department will not be ignored." Guomin She reported that the 18 branches of the 3rd district of this city held the 29th party member congress the day before yesterday, advocating strict punishment in the Bai case, but because the truth is unclear, four party members were specially assigned to conduct a secret investigation. In order to take into account the achievements of the Anti-Drug Association in its efforts to combat drugs over the past few years and to implement President Sun's anti-drug legacy, two measures were unanimously decided upon: (1) The National Anti-Drug Association should clearly dismiss Huang Jia-hui, the director-general and husband of Bai Zhiying, before the truth of the case is clear. (2) The National Anti-Drug Association should issue a statement in the newspaper stating that the case is a personal action of Huang Jia-hui and Bai Zhiying and has absolutely nothing to do with the Anti-Drug Association in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The above measures have been handed over to the executive committee of the branch for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Appeal Hearing for the Cai Fulin Kidnapping Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Bandits Continue to Shift Blame</p>
<p>Cai Fulin Recounts His Kidnapping Experience</p>
<p>Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, a comprador for the British American Tobacco Company, was kidnapped near Avenue Road and Hart Road on March 14th of the year before last and ransomed for 30,000 yuan. Subsequently, the police arrested several kidnappers, including Zhang Hongxiang, Jin Changshou, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Qian, and Chen Wu. After a trial by the Special District Court, Zhang Hongxiang and others were sentenced to death, while the remaining individuals received prison sentences. Zhang Qian was acquitted, and Chen Wu received a life sentence. Later, the police, dissatisfied with the acquittal of Zhang Qian, who was suspected of knowingly assisting the bandits by delivering food in their lair, filed an appeal. Chen Wu also hired a lawyer to appeal. The Higher Court held a hearing yesterday.</p>
<p>Zhang Qian: According to Zhang Qian's testimony, she is 22 years old, from Zhenjiang, and resides at No. 7 Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai. Zhang Jinsheng is her lover. Her former husband died on April 26th of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929]. She has been with Zhang for less than a year and does not know Zhang Hongxiang. Because it was Zhang Jintang's daughter's first-month celebration, her lover took her to a feast. Zhang Jintang's wife asked her to help with housework at her home, so she stayed there for about five days. At that time, Jintang's wife said that a friend from the military was sick in the pavilion and asked her to deliver food daily, only delivering it to the side of the staircase and not entering the room. She only went to the sun deck to dry clothes and saw a person sleeping on the bed. She claims she knew nothing about the kidnapping case.</p>
<p>Chen Wu: Chen Wu testified that she has a friendly relationship with Jin Changshou. Jin borrowed 3,000 taels and 5,000 yuan from a person surnamed Xia, with her husband acting as guarantor. Because the debt was overdue, her husband went to Songjiang. She went to the Great Eastern Hotel to demand repayment. At that time, she only heard Jin Changshou tell Zhang Jintang that Cai Fulin had a lot of family wealth, about two to three hundred thousand, and suggested they think of a way [to get it]. She only heard this from the side and did not participate in the discussion or receive any stolen money. The reason she was falsely accused was because she had quarreled with Jin Changshou over debt collection and stopped patronizing Lao Jie Fu, Yang Qing He, and other establishments, leading to a grudge, etc.</p>
<p>Jin Changshou: Jin Changshou stated that since he has already been convicted, everything he says is truthful. He testified that Chen Wu is a relative who seeks money and legal assistance. He does not owe Chen Wu any money; it was the person surnamed Xia who owed. He did not discuss the Cai kidnapping with Chen Wu. His previous testimony was based on what Zhang Jinsheng said because he was suffering from hemoptysis and afraid of police procedures. Therefore, his first statement to the police was entirely based on Zhang Jinsheng. His second statement in court was true. He did not know Zhang Jintang before; he met him at a gambling den through Chen Wu. Later, he lent money to Zhang Jintang and went to the Great Eastern Hotel to collect it. He denies ever saying to Zhang Jintang that Cai Fulin had two to three hundred thousand, etc.</p>
<p>Cai Fulin: According to Cai Fulin, after being kidnapped, he was first taken to Avenue Joffre, then to Avenue du Cycle for one day each, and then to No. 86 Zhoujiazui Road. It was a one-up, one-down house with a nanny, a caretaker, and children. There were three people guarding him with two handguns, which they carried interchangeably, sometimes holding them, sometimes hiding them on their bodies. Zhang Qian delivered food many times, bringing it into the room. On the surface, she looked like a nanny. He cannot be certain whether she participated in the kidnapping, but it is difficult to say she knew nothing. Inside the lair, he only read newspapers and was treated very comfortably, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Jinsheng: Zhang Jinsheng testified that he worked as a waiter at Quan Jia Fu. Jin Changshou came to eat, which is how they met. Later, he learned that Jin ran the Great Eastern Hotel and often went there to play when getting an oil massage. One day, he saw a note demanding ransom money from Cai Fulin. When the matter was exposed, he was forced to write letters four times. However, he did not see Chen Wu at the time. Zhang Jintang told him at the police station that if he did not implicate Chen Wu, Chen Wu would have him shot, so he had no choice but to falsely accuse her, etc. The judges repeatedly questioned the defendants and allowed the defense lawyers and police lawyers to cross-examine. After a final court ruling, the closing arguments concluded and sentencing was scheduled for March 8th.</p>

<p>The Extortion Letters are in Official Style</p>
<p>The Handwriting is Elegant and Bears an Official Seal</p>
<p>Hu Yigu was Also Extorted</p>
<p>Liu Ronggen, a Chinese detective from the Jing'an Temple police station, along with Wang Zhusheng, and Bao Tan Shan Huihai, previously arrested three members of an extortion gang: Zhou Wangzuo, Guo Xianggao, and Tang Shuisheng. Bai Zhongqi, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Huisi police station, also apprehended one of their accomplices, Zhang Jinhai, and brought him to the Special District Court for trial and detention. After a thorough investigation, the detective discovered that the defendants had colluded to write threatening letters in the Public Concession, demanding huge sums of money from wealthy households in at least sixteen cases. This is unprecedented. Moreover, the letters used by these individuals were in official style, the handwriting was elegant, and they bore an official seal. The letters were in the name of the "National Salvation Martial Arts Association" and generally stated that they were short of military funds and were temporarily borrowing several thousand yuan from the recipient. The wording was often similar. The details of each case are recorded below: (1) On January 25th of this year, attempted to defraud Chen Junbao of 5,000 yuan at No. 197 Muir Road; (2) In April of the 18th year of the Republic [i.e., 1929], attempted to defraud Dr. Yun Tieqiao of 500 yuan at No. 278 Yunnan Road; (3) In February of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Shen Yuzi, the owner of the Shi Ming Electric Light Store, of 200 yuan at No. 1305 Beijing Road; (4) In December of the 17th year [i.e., 1928], attempted to defraud Dr. Shen Zhuoru of a large sum at No. 42 Guling Road; (5) In March of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Wang Gaosheng, the owner of a hardware store, of 3,000 yuan at No. 289 Avenue Foch; (6) In May of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Tian Yushu of 2,000 yuan at No. 694 Shanhai Pass Road; (7) In January of this year, attempted to defraud Ye Zengshou of a large sum at No. 369 Yulin Road; (8) In January of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Dr. Xu Yi of a large sum at No. 713 Dixwell Road; (9) In December of the 17th year, attempted to defraud Dr. Sun Yusheng of a large sum at No. 1594 North Chengdu Road; (10) In December of the 17th year, extorted 30 yuan from Fan Xiaoling at No. 407 Jiujiang Road; (11) In June of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Dr. Zhu Zongzeng of a large sum at No. 70 Yunnan Road; (12) In November of the 17th year, attempted to defraud Guo Zibin of a large sum at No. 101 New Dagu Road; (14) In June/July of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Zhang Jianqing of a large sum at No. 762 East Yalu Road; (15) In May of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Gu Disan, a comprador for the Korean Bank, of a large sum at No. 41 Gordon Road; (16) In June of the 18th year, attempted to defraud Hu Yigu, the head of the civil division of the Jiangsu Higher Court, of 3,000 yuan at No. 432 Dixwell Road, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zitan presided over a continued hearing in the second criminal court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin began by presenting the case, stating that during the previous court session, the defendant Tang Shuisheng confessed that he was the informant in this case (i.e., the reporter) and had previously reported Zhang Jinhai and others to Chinese Detective Chief Bai Zhongqi. Now that Detective Chief Bai has also arrived in court, he should be questioned. Detective Chief Bai then testified that Tang was indeed an informant in the case. He said that he was unaware of Tang's arrest until Tang's wife came to his office crying, saying that he had been detained by the Jing'an Temple police station. Judge Ge then questioned the defendants and ordered them to be taken back into custody, with a rescheduled hearing on the afternoon of the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Cultural Theft Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Wei Juezhong's Identity Verification Photos with Inscriptions Stolen</p>
<p>Hoping the Thief Will Return Them to Complete His Writing</p>
<p>The New Voice Society received a letter yesterday from the Nanyang Cultural Undertakings Department of National Jinan University, stating that Mr. Wei Juezhong, who traveled extensively throughout Nanyang by bicycle the year before last, had returned to China last year and published his work, "Southern Wilderness Peoples." Because he preferred tranquility, he moved from Shanghai to No. 932 Zhenru Railway Station Road to write and prepare for a trip to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Unexpected Theft: Unfortunately, on the morning of March 10th, Mr. Wei went to Shanghai for business. When he returned in the afternoon, his door had been pried open by a thief. His clothes and money were all gone. Mr. Wei's travel identification, autographs from celebrities from various places, photos of local people taken along the way, and many manuscripts about Nanyang were also stolen.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with Grief: Mr. Wei was overwhelmed with grief. He wrote many notices about the lost items, posted them on busy streets, hoping that the thief would have a change of heart and return the results of his many years of travel in Nanyang. However, to this day, there is still no news. Mr. Wei is restless and seems to be developing a nervous disorder. According to Mr. Wei, all civilized countries in the world take great care to protect travelers. Although the theft occurred in broad daylight and was reported to the police, the stolen items have not been recovered. He sincerely hopes that the local authorities can quickly help him recover his important documents and travel identification so that he can complete his great undertaking of traveling the world and prevent overseas Chinese in Nanyang from viewing the country as a dangerous place, hesitating to come forward.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Room Renters are Robbers <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Women First Rent the Room</p>
<p>Robbers Search Each Household</p>
<p>A daytime robbery occurred yesterday, the 1st, at 3:30 PM at No. 157, Section West, Shanhai Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Several Families Reside in One House: No. 157 Shanhai Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, is a three-story stone-framed building along the road. The sublessor, surnamed Yang, works at the China Bookstore and lives in the west wing downstairs. He rents the east wing to a family surnamed Chen and the pavilion in the west wing to a family surnamed Zhang. Two other families live upstairs, both of whom are engaged in business. The men are all away, leaving only women inside.</p>
<p>Young Girl Opens the Door: The sublessor had posted a rental notice on the door because there were vacant rooms upstairs. A woman came to inquire about renting the rooms the week before last, but it did not work out. Yesterday (the 1st) at 3:30 PM, a young, fashionably dressed girl knocked on the door claiming to be interested in renting a room. The old woman surnamed Yang, the sublessor, opened the door and led her upstairs to look around. After briefly inquiring about the rent, the girl left. Then, three robbers wearing long gowns and mandarin jackets, speaking with northern accents, each carrying a handgun, broke into the west wing downstairs and searched it thoroughly. They first silenced the old woman surnamed Yang, forcibly removing a gold bracelet and two gold rings from her hand. They then went to the Chen family in the east wing, holding a gun and forcing them into the back room. They snatched a jewelry box containing emerald jade ornaments (worth about several hundred yuan) and removed a six-qian gold ring from the maid's hand. Then they went to the Zhang family in the pavilion, removing two gold bracelets from the housewife's hand and stealing 55 yuan in cash from her friend surnamed Wang.</p>
<p>A Bullet is Dropped: The robbers, fearing trouble because the search took too long, did not dare go upstairs. They hurriedly carried the stolen goods and fled. One of the robbers dropped a bullet from his handgun, but they did not have time to pick it up. They fled through the front door. After the robbers left, the victims picked up the bullet and saw the number 32 written on it.</p>
<p>Victims Report to the Police, Requesting Arrest: The total loss for the three families was approximately 2,000 yuan. The victims filed a report with the Xinzha police station, requesting an arrest. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and begin the arrest.</p>

<p>The Stolen Goods are in the Thief's Mouth</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10 AM, a Yangzhou woman named Hu Wang was returning from buying vegetables on Ninghe Road when a robber suddenly approached her from behind near the entrance of Maijia Lane and snatched a pair of gold rings from her ears. She cried out for help, and a guard named Liu Shuyin from the nearby Fourth Post heard her and immediately gave chase. Her husband, Mr. Hu, also heard the commotion and joined in the pursuit. They managed to restrain the robber. The robber, realizing his predicament, secretly put the stolen goods in his mouth. Officer Liu searched him thoroughly but could not find any evidence. Mr. Hu was furious because he knew that the robber had stolen his wife's gold earrings and was unable to recover the stolen goods. He immediately slapped the robber in the face. The robber cried out in pain, opening his mouth, and a pair of gold rings fell out. They took the robber and the stolen goods back to the third section of the first district, where Section Chief Jin interrogated him. The robber confessed his name was Zhang Agen, 24 years old, a local resident lodging at Tianfu Inn on Second Ma Road in the Public Concession. He also admitted to robbing the woman's gold rings. He was ordered to prepare a document and hand over the person and stolen goods to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Anhui has suffered from natural disasters and banditry in recent years, and society is bleak. However, people from Anhui are striving for cultural development, such as the construction of Anhui University, the compilation of the Anhui Gazetteer, and the advancement of the Oriental Cultural Society. Recently, they have jointly planned to establish the Anhui Series Publishing House to publish the Anhui Series. Many people have recognized and invested in the project, led by Mr. Cheng Linsheng, China's only great collector of ancient bronzes, who has provided a large sum of money for start-up costs. The establishment meeting was held last month at Cheng Linsheng's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, and Jiang Tonghou was elected as the director and Wang Mengzou as the clerk. Yesterday, the editorial review committee met at Cheng Yansheng's residence on Avenue Foch, and Xu Jiyu and Huang Binhong (both also serving as standing members for collecting versions), Chen Ziyan, Hong Zecheng, Zhang Yanchang, Cheng Linsheng (also serving as standing members for economics), Xu Jingren, Cheng Yansheng (also serving as standing members for public relations), Li Guangjiong, Li Mugong, Li Weihou, Wu Jingtian (also serving as standing members for documentation), Zhou Meiquan, Wang Yitang, and Hu Pu'an were elected as the 15 members of the editorial review committee.

<h3 id="e155">A Glimpse of the Qipu Road Robbery <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Six Robbers Ascend the Stairs Three Times</p>
<p>The Ma Family's Loss is Fortunately Not Huge</p>
<p>The home of a Mr. Ma, an employee of the Shenchang Foreign Firm, at No. 622 Dongpuyi Lane, Qipu Road, south of the District Court, was robbed yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. Although the loss was less than a thousand gold, the location is next to the court and police station. The robbers dared to be so rampant in broad daylight, showing extreme disregard for the law. The details of the robbery are described below:</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's residence is a two-story building. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, only Mr. Ma's wife, mother-in-law, and a maid were at home in the living room, preparing the vegetables they had bought. Mr. Ma had already gone to work, and his children were at school. Six robbers in short clothes arrived at Dongpuyi Lane. One robber guarded the back door of Mr. Ma's residence in the second alley, and the other five entered the first alley. Leaving one robber to loiter at the entrance as a lookout, the other four knocked on the front door of Mr. Ma's residence, claiming to need to discuss business with Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma's wife told the maid to open the door. The four robbers swarmed in and immediately closed the door tightly. One robber stood leaning against the door, and another robber pulled out a handgun and a foot-long white blade, holding one in each hand. They first warned the maid not to make a sound, then addressed Mr. Ma's wife as "Master Ma's wife" and claimed to be there to borrow money. Mr. Ma's wife said that her family was poor and asked for forgiveness. Mr. Ma's mother-in-law also said to the robbers that they were near the court and asked them not to be rash. The robbers showed displeasure upon hearing this, claiming that they were not interfering with public affairs and were willing to die for their cause. They then stared at Mr. Ma's wife's neck, suspecting that she might be wearing gold necklaces or lockets. Mr. Ma's wife immediately unbuttoned her collar. Seeing that there was nothing, the robbers snatched a jade hairpin from her hair. They also wanted to rob the gold earrings from her ears, but Mr. Ma's wife said that they were trivial and asked them to leave them alone. The robbers then gave up. They asked Mr. Ma's wife or the maid to lead them upstairs, but neither was willing. Therefore, the three robbers went upstairs themselves, entered the room, and rummaged through the chests and cabinets. They only found a gold watch worth 60 yuan and over 100 yuan in cash. They went downstairs and whispered to each other, then said that the amount was not enough to cover their travel expenses. They went back upstairs and searched again, but did not find anything valuable. However, they still wanted to leave, then stopped for a third time and went upstairs, taking a fox fur coat, a cat fur coat, and a long lined robe, which the three robbers put on. Because there were still account books and blank checks on the table, they wrapped them up in a piece of white cloth. They also took a vintage gold button from Mr. Ma's wife's clothing and a box of copper coins and miscellaneous currency (which were kept for the children as toys) from the desk. They then calmly said to Mr. Ma's wife that they originally intended to take Mr. Ma with them, but they spared him because his family depended on him for a living. They told her to carefully observe their faces if she wanted to recognize them. While speaking, they drove Mr. Ma's wife, the maid, and his elderly, visually impaired mother-in-law behind a screen and used electrical wire to tie up the screen before shouting and fleeing through the front door. After a long time, Mr. Ma's wife and the others went upstairs to check and saw that the boxes and belongings were still neatly arranged by the robbers. They estimated that the stolen goods were worth no less than several hundred gold. Just as they were about to file a report with the police, the Huisi police station, which had already received a report, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives in cars to Mr. Ma's house to investigate. They then notified all police stations to pursue and arrest the robbers and punish them. There were police posts within dozens of yards on all sides, showing the robbers' audacity was truly outrageous.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Russian Woman Seems to Have a Nervous Disorder <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Her Actions and Words are Incomprehensible</p>
<p>Will Be Sent to Harbin Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>It was previously discovered that a Russian woman named Shuai Si Peilin had engaged in certain behaviors, and the Municipal Council dispatched police officers to closely monitor her. The woman used this as a pretext to write to the Chief of Police, demanding compensation of 100,000 yuan for her losses. She also wrote to Yang, the district chief of the police department, and Ma Hao, a Western detective, demanding a monthly allowance of 600 yuan. She also falsely accused Detective Ma of stealing her clothes and jewelry. Her actions were similar to those of someone with a nervous disorder. The police arrested the Russian woman and sent her to the Special District Court, which ordered her to be examined by a doctor from the Municipal Council. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu brought Shuai Si Peilin to court again for a continued hearing. Police lawyer Wei Yinde presented the examination report from Dr. Smith, the director of the Municipal Council Hospital, stating that according to Dr. Smith's diagnosis, she was indeed suffering from mental illness. If the woman were allowed to remain in Shanghai, she would pose a danger to the public. The police are currently planning to send her to the mental hospital of the China Eastern Railway in Harbin. The expenses will be borne by the police. Shuai Si Peilin then stated through an interpreter that the evidence presented by the police to arrest her was insufficient to prove her guilt, so her arrest was illegal. She did not have a mental illness, and the police's statements were not credible. Judge Xu said that she had previously reported stolen items, but the police department's investigation proved that her report was false. Her actions constituted false accusation, which is a criminal offense. The case still requires Dr. Smith to be summoned to court to inquire about her condition, so the hearing must be postponed. The police then took the Russian woman away for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Yu Hechang's Wife Recovery Case <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Summary of Yesterday's Second Hearing</p>
<p>Seven-Day Deadline for the Wei Mother and Daughter to Hand Over the Person</p>
<p>Yu Hechang, a 45-year-old businessman from Nantong with some savings, married Wei Zhaodi, the daughter of Wei Chen, from Ningbo several years ago. The relationship between the couple was good after the marriage. However, since last year, his wife was seduced by her younger sister, Wei Amao, to commit adultery with others and colluded to abscond, resulting in a loss of more than 1,300 yuan. Her whereabouts are still unknown. Yu Hechang filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court. Since the defendant lived in the Public Concession, he hired lawyer Li Junhuan to file a complaint with the Special District Court. The first hearing was held in the third court on March 2nd. Yesterday afternoon was the second hearing, presided over by Judge Cheng Shangfeng. The defendant, Wei Sanmao, and the defendant's mother, Wei Chen, were both present in court to await questioning. First, the plaintiff, Yu Hechang, stated the circumstances of his wife's seduction by Wei Sanmao and the reasons for his accusation. Wei Sanmao denied seducing her sister, and Wei Chen also claimed that she did not know anything about her daughter's adultery and absconding. After the interrogation, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for one week and that the defendants Wei Sanmao and Wei Chen hand over Wei Zhaodi within one week. At the same time, the plaintiff must also make further inquiries to facilitate the hearing. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>In the Yinhang Water and Electricity Plant River</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a male corpse of about thirty years old floated up in the river of the Yinhang Water and Electricity Plant in the Hudong Yinhang district. The upper body was wearing a black cloth short shirt and cotton vest, while the lower body was completely naked, without a thread. The police station in charge was informed and sent police to investigate. The corpse had been in the water for a long time and no injuries were found. Whether it was thrown into the river and murdered or drowned himself is difficult to determine for the moment. However, the fact that he was not wearing trousers is very suspicious, so the local security chief has been instructed to report to the local court for inspection.</p>

<p>Parking on Roadside Suffers Undeserved Disaster</p>
<p>At 11:10 last night, a car on Nanjing Road at the Jiangxi Road intersection crashed into a tram, causing it to derail and narrowly escaping a major disaster. A No. 7 tram was traveling west on Nanjing Road. About twenty yards from the intersection of Jiangxi Road, a No. 11749 Packard sedan, also traveling west, attempted to overtake the tram. Unexpectedly, a No. 1163 black Packard sedan was parked on the side of the road in front of the New Comfort House. As the No. 7 tram was passing the parked car, the No. 11749 car sped forward between the two vehicles. However, the car body was huge and the road narrow, making it difficult to pass. The car crashed into the tram with great force, causing it to derail. The tram was unable to brake and, after derailing, moved forward in a semicircle, passing in front of the New Comfort House and the Sino-American Bookstore until it stopped in front of the Japan International Tourist Bureau at No. 80 Nanjing Road. The iron gate of the Japan International Tourist Bureau was broken by the tram, and a large piece of glass in the door and window area was also shattered. The iron gate of the tram was also damaged by the No. 11749 car. The front and rear right fenders of the offending car were completely destroyed in the collision with the tram, while the left rear fender was damaged in the collision with the parked No. 3163 car. The No. 1163 car also suffered damage to the rear right fender. A No. 1546 Nash sedan, which was following closely behind the No. 11749 car, was also slightly damaged in the collision. The accident occurred late at night, and fortunately, there were fewer pedestrians and vehicles on the road, so no one was injured. The three cars involved and their drivers were taken to the Central Police Station by the patrolmen. The offending car, No. 11749, is owned by Ma Yinchu.</p>

If the association's funds were insufficient, he would personally bear the cost, which was unanimously approved. Zhang Ji then proposed the placement of unemployed classmate Qiu Hongnian. Xia Fei, He Daosheng, and others also expressed their opinions. As a result, Zhou Shixun was responsible for the placement.

<h3 id="e171">Dispute Among New Workers on the Gonghe Steamer <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Temporarily Allowed on Board, Work as Usual</p>
<p>Chen Bonian, the new comprador of the Ewo Company's Gonghe Steamer, declared when he boarded the ship at 2:00 p.m. on the 31st of last month to take over that all thirty-eight new workers, including Chen Jinlan, would be dismissed and ordered to leave the ship. All the new workers had no choice but to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau sent Wang Bing to the Gonghe Steamer at the Shuntai Wharf to negotiate with the new comprador, resulting in (1) the thirty-eight new workers being temporarily allowed on board to work as usual, and (2) waiting for the Hankou Municipal Government to arbitrate. Thus, the dispute among the new workers was temporarily resolved.</p>

<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>Details of the strike that occurred on the Jiangyu Steamer have been reported in previous newspapers. The cause of the incident was that the General Bureau transferred the boatswain to Tianjin, causing a misunderstanding among the workers who suspected that he had been dismissed. They petitioned the union to retain him, but the bureau stated that the order had already been issued and it was difficult to change. Therefore, the strike occurred. After receiving the news, the General Bureau immediately sent Nan Zhan Inspection Director Liu Zhen, Deputy Director Qiao Songren, and Bei Zhan Inspection Director Xu Songyue to the Seamen's Union to negotiate several times before they finally understood. However, in order to maintain its authority, the bureau had temporarily agreed to serve on the ship. The union secretaries believed that the tone of the reply was vague and feared that it would change halfway, so they asked Du Yuesheng to mediate. The result was satisfactory. That evening, the ship loaded all the goods accumulated at the dock and sailed at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>

<p>— Lean Sheep</p>
<p>▲ If I have nothing to praise and people praise me, it will only increase my shame. If I have something to praise and people praise me, it will only increase my pride.</p>
<p>▲ When doing things for a lover, be careful and prudent in everything, but the result may not be pleasing. When doing things for a friend, be casual, but the result may not be bad.</p>
<p>▲ Do not think that past events have already happened and will not be pursued, and that you are innocent. If you think about them in a quiet night, you will always feel some remorse in your conscience.</p>
<p>▲ The laughter of a person who is natural is everlasting, while the suffering of a person who is forced is deep.</p>
<p>▲ When I have not yet married, I envy the happiness of other people's couples. After I get married, I have many pains that I cannot express.</p>
<p>▲ It is impossible for people who have been in a dark environment for a long time to walk towards the path of light, because this kind of bad society is not easy to improve.</p>
<p>▲ Love is indeed sacred and inevitable for young men and women. You must know what the purpose of love is after love and how painful it will be when you lose love before you love.</p>
<p>▲ A person who cares about morality and integrity will never be willing to do evil, because morality and integrity are the barriers that prevent people from doing evil.</p>
<p>▲ When I am bored, receiving a comforting letter from a lover is like drinking nectar, but on the contrary, it is like drinking poison, which is enough to kill.</p>
<p>▲ No matter what the matter is, the more clues there are, the more chaotic it becomes. Borrowing a sum of money, I wish the interest would be less and lighter.</p>
<p>▲ Comparing fame and money, fame is indeed no match for money, but a person who cherishes fame will never be bought by money and lose his fame, because fame cannot be bought with money.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Record of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Fund-Raising Banquet <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to raise funds for the Shaanxi disaster relief, invited the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, the Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, Xu Shiying, and the Chairman of the Shaanxi Relief Committee, Kang Jiyao, to report on the disaster situation at the meeting. It specially invited all executive committee members of various industry associations to attend the lecture. Hundreds of people attended, which was an unprecedented grand occasion since the establishment of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The general situation has been reported in the newspapers. For the sake of pleading for the disaster victims, I will add the trivial details below to inform the philanthropists who did not attend, and ask them to generously donate to the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association in the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road so that it can be remitted to Zhu Ziqiao to personally distribute it to save the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲ Crowded Signing In The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce resolved to invite the chairmen and committee members of various industry associations to be the leaders of the fundraising groups, the standing committee members to be the staff, and the executive committee members to be the members. Each group should be named after the industry it represents, and the donation amount for each group should be at least 1,000 yuan. A list of the staff members of each group was printed and distributed to the various associations. After 6:00 p.m. that evening, the committee members of various associations went to the meeting to listen to the lecture. The signing-in desk was set up at the entrance of the meeting hall. In addition to writing the name of the committee member, the name of the association must also be noted. There were too many people and too few books, so there were six or seven layers of people standing around the signing-in desk waiting to sign in, which was extremely crowded.</p>
<p>▲ Queuing to Enter The Room After each person signed in, they were guided by the reception staff to the standing meeting room and guest room on the third floor for tea. Because Yu Youren was concerned about disaster relief in his hometown, he arrived on time, wearing cloth socks and cloth shoes as usual. In addition to discussing disaster relief with Wang Yiting, Xu Shiying, and others, he also nodded to each industry representative as a gesture of respect. His eyebrows were still furrowed in a strong smile. It was probably because he had just returned from Shaanxi and had not forgotten the suffering of the disaster victims in his hometown. Around 7:00 p.m., because there was no space in the two rooms, Wang Xiaolai and Wu Zhihao led the guests to enter the meeting hall on the second floor. There were too many people and the door was narrow, so they entered in single file, walking in pairs like soldiers departing, which felt quite orderly.</p>
<p>▲ Not A Banquet The dishes that evening were provided by the Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant. There were five tables per row and ten rows in total, all using square tables. After seating, Wang Xiaolai stood up and stated that it was not a banquet, briefly stating that today was the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. The National Government still ordered the entire country to stop banquets on this day to express condolences. This association invited President Yu to report on the disaster situation in Shaanxi in order to raise funds for disaster relief. Because President Yu had just established the Control Yuan and his political affairs were complicated, he could not spare time except on Sundays, so he scheduled the lecture for tonight. Due to time constraints, he could not let everyone listen to the lecture on an empty stomach, so he slightly prepared some dishes, and they were all vegetarian, containing the meaning of mourning the martyrs, which did not violate the National Government's order, etc. Everyone praised his appropriate wording.</p>
<p>▲ Urging People To Eat First Xu Shiying said in his report, in addition to describing the process of organizing the Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster and the enthusiasm of all circles, which had already donated more than 197,000 yuan, which represented the gratitude of the disaster victims, that the Shaanxi disaster film that was screened that evening was filmed by Zhu Ziqiao when he went to Shaanxi for disaster relief, recording the situations he saw at any time, including living skeletons with bones as thin as firewood, the great tragedy of entire families starving to death, those who died and had no materials to bury and howling beside them, and those who madly ate tree bark because of hunger and died on the road due to bloating. The various situations were too tragic to bear to watch. He was afraid that everyone would have difficulty swallowing after watching, so he asked them to eat well in advance before watching the film. The audience was saddened.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Record of the Scenic Spots of the Three Mountains in Zhenjiang <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Xiezhong</p>
<p>My hometown, Jingkou's Three Mountains, stand in a tripod formation, and their majestic and dangerous terrain is truly an immortal scenic spot for thousands of years. According to the "Northern Gu" mountain, its name is "Northern Gu", according to the Southern History, Emperor Wu of Liang once climbed to observe it for a long time and ordered, "This ridge is not enough, it must be defended." However, Jingkou is indeed magnificent, so its name was changed from "Northern Gu". Jinshan was formed from the veins of Yinshan and its name comes from the "Flower Adornment Sutra". It has the saying that "outside Jambudvipa, in the fragrant water sea, there are seven golden mountains surrounding Mount Sumeru", and because the seawater swirls and overflows with no fixed point, seven great golden mountains are set up to stabilize it. This mountain is similar, so it is named "Jinshan". The Sanskrit word "Sumeru" in Chinese means "sublime height", so it is also named "Sublime Height Peak", also named "Golden Turtle" and "Crouching Ox", all named after their shapes, also named "Toutuo Rock" because the Tang Dynasty Pei Toutuo obtained Jin Jiao Mountain on the riverbank as the hermitage of Han Dynasty Jiao Xian, so the name "Jiao Mountain" was changed to the name "Jiao Mountain". This is how the names of the Three Mountains came about. The back peak of "Northern Gu" pillows the great river. On the upper moon, there is the Ganlu Temple. On the north cliff of the mountain, there is the Five Sages Hall. Northeast of Jinshan, there is the Chaoyang Cave. Southeast of the mountain, there is the Jinyu Rock, and the Zexin Temple is on it. West of Jiao Mountain, there is the Luohan Rock. Southwest, there is the Three Imperial Edict Cave. Its temple was formerly named Pujichan Temple. The magnificence of the palaces and temples of the Three Mountains is exhausted here. "Northern Gu" has the Shifan Building, Duojing Building, Qinghui Pavilion, Lingyun Pavilion, and Fishing Platform. Jinshan has the Miaogao Platform, Fujin Hall, Liuyu Pavilion, and Zhenliu Pavilion. Jiao Mountain has the Jiachu Pavilion, Haiyun Hall, Yinjiang Pavilion, and Yuebo Platform. "Northern Gu" has the rushing horse gully, the very stone beam, Emperor Wu of Liang's iron pot, Li Weigong's iron tower, and his hand-planted cypress trees. Jinshan has the Zhongling Spring, Su Gong's jade belt, and Zhou Ding. Jiao Mountain has the Crane Inscription Burial, the ancient tripod, the Dingtao tripod, the Han bronze drum, and the ink treasure of Yang Zhongmin Gong. There are many ancient relics, fortunately, they have not been submerged in the vicissitudes of life. Those who visit the Three Mountains, in addition to admiring the aura of the mountains and rivers, the wild grass and green smoke have not failed to make people feel emotional. Now that the spring is bright and beautiful, there are many nobles and celebrities who invite them to visit the Three Mountains. If the mountain spirits know, they will also dance with the waves.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Yue Lun Sculpture Exhibition <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Er</p>
<p>The Yue Lun Sculpture Exhibition was held in the hall of the French School on Huanlong Road for ten days. On the last day, I took some time to go and see it. I recently met Yue Jun and saw his sculpture film, which had already moved my appreciation and made me want to see his real work.</p>
<p>Yue Jun is from my Hunan Province, the son of Yue Fushizhang (named Sen, styled Hongqun). He studied in France for eight years. In 1923, he studied painting at the National School of Fine Arts in Lyon. At the same time, he studied sculpture in the private studio of Professor Proust, a sculpture teacher at the school. Proust's studio contained many new and old masterpieces and his personal proud works. Yue Jun wandered among them, gaining extremely deep observation and understanding. After studying like this for four years, he went to Paris, the center of art, and entered the Paris National School of Fine Arts, where he studied under Bourdelle. Bourdelle was the first sculptor of modern times and was known as the first person after Rodin. The artistic feature is to emphasize the expression of strength. Yue Jun thought about doing his best. After only one year, Bourdelle passed away. Yue Jun also studied under Boerhena. Boerhe's art specializes in delicacy and is opposite to Bourdelle's sculptural expression method. Yue Jun felt a strong feeling of giving and taking the strengths of both families for his own research after being trained in a strong method and suddenly being trained in a soft method. He was greatly advanced by Boerhe. Soon after, Yue Jun rented a house outside of Paris, leaving the teacher to study alone. From the winter of 1928 to the spring of 1930, he created many works. First, he participated in the Lyon Art Research Association's exhibition in 1929 and won an honorary certificate. Then, he went to the French Artists Federation's 1930 Paris Salon exhibition and won the highest honorary certificate and received great praise in the Paris newspapers.</p>
<p>This exhibition back in China brings back a dozen or so pieces that can be brought back. I looked at his works, and in terms of strength, I loved his "Old Man" and "Human Body", and in terms of softness, I loved his "Self-Portrait" and "Portrait of Ms. R" "Portrait of My Wife", as well as "Sun Yat-sen's Portrait", "Liao Zhongkai's Portrait", and "Tan Zu'an's Portrait" are all lifelike and exquisite.</p>
<p>His exhibition has inscriptions by contemporary celebrities, and I love Mr. Yi Peiji's inscription "Its Art is Brilliant" the most. The word is very unique, and the inscription "White House Residence" is even more unique.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Talk About Wolfberry <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Wolfberry is the only vegetable dish that is usually eaten in my county recently. It is said that the spring air is warm and the shoots germinate and develop here, which is very prosperous. When people in the countryside carry vegetables into the market, almost no one does not have them, and the profits are also higher. In the beginning, the price was extremely expensive, and every two taels of copper coins had to be ten pieces to get their permission, so old gluttons would not hesitate to buy them to taste their taste, and those who struggled to make a living would not dare to ask about them even if they saw them.</p>
<p>This thing does not grow in the wilderness, but always on the side of the fence or on the wall slope, so it cannot be planted and picked. It is also not easy to find at first. There is not much production in the county, and most of it is transshipped from Taicang. Because the people of Lou eat very little, it can be used to supplement here and the price can gradually flatten. At present, it is almost everywhere in the market, which also shows that one side has a special addiction. Looking at its cooking method, it is also different from other places. Wolfberry tastes bitter and astringent, so even the best chefs must add heavy sugar to make it palatable, or even fry it in lard, just like the Shanghai Sichuan and Fujian restaurants. I don't know that it is too thick and greasy, so it loses its original nature. Therefore, my county is just stir-fried, even fragrant mushrooms and sesame oil are not allowed to be added a little, only enough vegetable oil is enough. What cannot be missing is not bamboo shoots, and its taste is not beautiful. The most taboo is soy sauce, if you violate it, it will lose its sweetness and forget its inherent quality. Those who don't know how to eat this thing are not good at eating wolfberry. The records about wolfberry are not the same. It is a shrub and Lanya says, "Eating its roots can lighten the body and benefit the qi", which is called the holy medicine, probably referring to the wolfberry root bark. The Ben Cao has a saying that "it can be used as a fairy's staff", which is to describe its old branches and bent shape. Or it is called "Heavenly Essence Son", and its red seeds can also be used as medicine, but it does not say that eating its fat and tender branches and leaves shows that eating this has not started since ancient times, but it has become popular in modern times. However, customs vary from place to place, and hobbies are also different. I don't know why there are so many people who like to eat it in my county alone, so I specifically describe it.</p>
<p>▲ News from the Publishing World Yang Yunshi is talented and has the eyes of a contemporary talent. His poems are as good as the Tang sages, and his five-character poems are almost unmatched in the world. I have seen his Tianshan Song Seven Ancient poems, which reached more than 2,600 words. Recently, I saw another article, Vomiting Blood Chant Five Ancient poems, which reached 240 rhymes. His seven-character poems are amazing and his five-character poems are like Du Fu resurrected. I heard that his complete works will be sold by the Zhenmei Shan Bookstore in the near future, printed by the Zhonghua Bookstore in Song edition style, with exquisite craftsmanship. It is expected that once this collection comes out, Luoyang will be short of paper. Last year, Fan Fanshan died in error, and the literati were shocked and told each other that from then on, the leader would be none other than Yunshi. Now that Fanshan is dead, and Yunshi's poetry collection has been published, I know that once this collection comes out, the poetry genre in the country will definitely change. This is also a major key to the change in modern poetry (Chunmu)</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 30th, a monk brought a letter of introduction from University Professor D. P. Bagchi. The monk's name was Satyawanda. Professor Bagchi was introducing a Chinese scholar, the monk Satyawanda, who wished to organize the Asiatic League of Culture. Professor Bagchi had traveled to China and written the book Deux Lexiquues Sanskrit_Chinois Tome i, also named "News of Sanskrit and Tang Dynasties," as well as the Thousand Character Classic, and the “Meaning of Cleanliness” and “Miscellaneous Names in Sanskrit” collected by the Kucha Śramaṇa Liyan in a Japanese edition with phonetic annotations by Professor Bagchi. It is an essential book for learning Sanskrit. The monk Satyawanda showed me the charter of his Asiatic League of Culture. I originally intended to discuss it with the charter of the Oriental Literary Renaissance Society. The monk had studied Marxist theory. Observing Marxism from an Indian perspective, he was naturally dissatisfied. Therefore, he wanted to correct the flaws of Western materialism with Eastern art, literature, and philosophy. I advised him to travel to China and Japan to connect and advance together.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went with an Indian friend to the Bengli Botanic Garden. From the corner of the university, we took a tram to Strand Road High Court. Each person paid two annas and got off to wait for a small ferry. This is the bank of the sacred Ganges. The Ganges originates in Tibet, gathers water from various places, flows to Calcutta, and enters the Bay of Bengal at its mouth. The water is not very clear, resembling the Yellow River, but it is calm and without waves at its entrance, which is not very wide, only about the size of our Zhun'er Bao Mi Ke said that the Ganges was an ancient holy land, rumored to originate in heaven. According to the Tibetan Plateau, its source is from heaven. This agrees with Li Bai's poem, "The Yellow River's water comes from heaven," but it has been falsely spread into mythology. Many people bathe in the Ganges, including women, all wearing clothes. Having come to this holy land, I could not but receive a baptism. After crossing to the north bank near the botanical garden, I chose a place to wash my head and feet. Indeed, my body and mind felt cleansed. The greatest memory of the Ganges for us is that people in China have almost all seen the Surangama Sutra. The sutra contains a dialogue between the Buddha and King Pasenadi, roughly saying, "Your Majesty, when did you see the Ganges?" The king said, "When I was three years old, my loving mother took me to visit Jivaka. At that time, I knew there was the Ganges." Such stories are not only philosophical cases but also evoke boundless deep feelings of gratitude and filial piety. We waited half an hour in the waiting room for the small ferry to come. Tickets were bought for four annas per person for first class and two annas for second class. After getting on the boat, we stopped twice, the second time at the botanical garden. Indian guards in red turbans with long poles guarded the gate. No fee was required to enter. The trees were so tall that they reached into the clouds, with little sunlight reaching here. It was a truly cool and refreshing place. I originally had a deeper interest in studying plants. I once translated the complete volume of "Great Botany" by Japanese scholar Miyoshi Manabu with Mr. Sun Jianhong. However, I cannot now record many plant names. The garden is large, more than a square mile. Many people visit it, and Western ladies also come to visit on Sundays. There are also small signs indicating the scientific names of the plants, but not many, which is a pity. What is memorable is the banyan tree, which is 157 years old, 890 feet high, and has a circumference occupying 1,000 feet. The aerial roots extend and grow, forming another tree, with almost half an acre of land. It has become a pavilion where houses can be built. It is a remarkable sight. I have written a poem to record it:</p>
<p>The botanical garden borders the Ganges to the north,</p>
<p>Myriad trees reach the clouds, obscuring the sky.</p>
<p>Most beloved are the banyan mother and child trees,</p>
<p>Whose spreading roots have stood for a hundred and ten years.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Financial Gold Rush Surge <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>High Jump and Weak Nian</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Rising Step by Step Yesterday, the gold price on April 1st started weakly, then gradually became highly sought after. The upward momentum was unstoppable. The market moved progressively higher. There were only two or three taels of variation. The total difference in the market was 23 taels. In the end, it surged by 20 taels. The exchange rate trend was smooth, and the listed price was reduced by one grade. The market's demand exceeded supply. There were no changes in the overseas silver market, so the gold price opened low. Afterwards, Hengxing vigorously covered short positions, and major players rushed to buy, pushing the exchange rate even higher. People were shocked, and the price soared, surging by 20 taels. The market still felt strong, and buyers remained active, pushing the price beyond 720 taels. The final price was 724.5 taels. The speed of the rise was truly unexpected. In short, the Guang bang's covering of short positions was stimulated by the fact that the foreign exchange market was closed on Wednesday afternoon. The prediction for this morning was that the price would fall.</p>
<p>The opening was still weak. The May opening in the morning fell slightly by 2.5 mace, reaching 702.5 taels. This was because the prediction was bearish, so there was no movement. After the market closed, there were considerable purchases from the United States, but the private telegram only reported a decrease of 125. As a result, confidence seemed to weaken, with a rise and fall of one or two taels, from 04 taels falling to 02 taels. Then Hengxing and others sold, and suddenly it rose again to 04 taels because Maccari bought one unit of April British gold at 1375. The Dalian bang settled on 1.5 mace and 5 fen for each unit of current-month Dalian gold. Subsequently, Huabi and others released 75 units of current-month British gold, so the gold price was suppressed again to 02.5 taels. The first order was issued not to change, and it was 03.23 mace. However, the internal price seemed firm at 1375. Then the Macao bank released 6875, and the price rose to 06 taels. Before long, it depreciated by 2 taels to 04 taels. At 10:00, because Hengxing Shengda, Hengxing Yuan, Cuichang Xiangyi, and others fought to buy, the peak was reached, and the price soared into the sky, rising more than 10 taels. At 10:50, it had exceeded 710 taels, moving very quickly, with only a little more than one tael. Then, the price continued to advance. At 10:50, the Fung exchange suddenly reduced the grade by half, with British gold calculated at 125, US dollars at 25, and Japanese gold increased by 1.25 fen, so the price rose to 717.8 taels. Hengxing and others continued to drag in, reaching 20 taels at 11:00. Soon, retail investors and speculators sold, falling by more than 3 taels to 16.5 taels. Afterwards, the exchange market was even tighter. May and June British gold only settled at 13.5 to 4375. Then Xinxing and others chased to buy, so it broke through the 20-tael mark again. At 11:45, the British gold continued to reduce the grade by half, with 125 for British gold, 25 for US dollars, and 1.25 fen for Japanese gold. The price immediately rose to 23.5 taels. At this time, there seemed to be more sellers, and many short-term holders also sold, so it fell sharply by 4 taels to 19.5 taels. However, confidence remained high, and the price was pushed up to 22 taels. At noon, the listed price was changed to 771.478 to 50 taels.</p>
<p>Strong upward surge in the afternoon. The market opened flat in the afternoon at 21 taels, then decreased to 19 taels. Afterwards, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. Only when the Indian exchange rate reported a small increase of two annas did the buyers become active at 2:30, rising to 22 taels. However, because the exchange market was closed on Wednesday, it retreated to 20.05 taels around 3:00. Afterwards, Yuan Mao, Yong Yu, Da Qian, Chang Xiang, and others bought, so the price rose by more than 3 taels to 23.9 taels at 3:30. In a flash, it fell by more than 3 taels to 20.05 taels, probably due to the Dalian gang and others selling. Subsequently, Chengfeng, Yong Yuan, Mao Yong, Changsheng Yong, and others bought one after another, raising the price by more than 4 taels in just over 10 minutes, reaching 25 taels at 3:50. After 4:00, it was slightly suppressed by a little more than one tael. At 4:30, the market closed at 24.8 taels as Yuancheng and others took delivery. Compared to the previous day, it rose by 19.8 taels. Hengxing came to sell the whole day. The maximum price was 25 taels, and the minimum price was 02 taels, with a total difference of 23 taels. Looking back at the morning market, the goods were priced at 2 taels and 3 mace. The noon closing was 21 taels. The afternoon closed at 21 taels, and the listed price was 50 to 467 taels. The registered price was 17 to 21 taels, and the water compensation was 17 taels. The afternoon price was 21 taels.</p>
<p>A glimpse of buyers' activities. Transactions were quite active at various firms. Qian Changxiang, Cuichang Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Yuan Tai, Xinxing, and Zhifeng Yong all advanced. Hengxing Yuan and a certain Mr. Lu also advanced, becoming bullish. Fuchang and Yuanheng advanced and then exited. Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Changsheng Yong, Yuhe, and others came and went. Tong Taichang, Yuancheng, Futaiheng, and Yuan Mao Yong also exited. Hengxing and Shengda sold slightly at first and then vigorously covered short positions by a huge amount of 10,000 units. In the afternoon, Qian Changxiang, Changsheng Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and Yuancheng all advanced. Wanxing, Shunli, Tong Taichang, Yuan Tai, and Futaiheng all exited. Hengxing sold slightly. The Dalian gang released a total of 2,000 units and advanced more than 1,000 units. From April 3rd to 6th, it was the Western holiday (Easter). Banks were closed as usual, so the exchange would also be completely closed for four days. Trading would resume on the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Frequent Reduction in Foreign Exchange Quotations <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The internal market is also extremely sharp... The gold industry is heavily short</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no glory or disgrace in the British and American silver markets, but the exchange rate fell. Therefore, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's morning quotations for various exchanges, except for the German exchange, increased by 25 to 131 marks 75, and Hong Kong increased by 5 mace to 78 taels 75. The remaining changes were negligible. At 10:50, the grade was suddenly reduced by half, with British gold calculated at 125, US dollars at 25, Indian rupees at half a dollar, French francs at six yuan, Japanese yen at 75, Singapore exchange rate increased by one tael and five mace, and Japanese gold increased by 1.25 fen. Hong Kong was not listed, and the German exchange decreased by one yuan. At 11:45, the grade was further reduced by half, with British gold calculated at 12 taels, currently at one shilling three pence two five, US dollars at 25, calculated at thirty yuan eight seven five, Indian exchange rate at 75, calculated at eighty-five rupees two five, French francs at seven yuan, calculated at seven hundred and eighty-nine yuan, German exchange at one yuan, calculated at one hundred and twenty-nine marks seven five, Japanese yen at half a yuan, calculated at seventy-seven shields, Singapore exchange rate increased by one and a half taels, calculated at one hundred and eighty-two taels, Hong Kong still at seventy-eight taels seventy-five, Japanese gold increased by 1.25 fen, calculated at one tael six mace. The internal market was initially flat and then sharp because the gold market suddenly presented a peak, breaking out of 720 taels and above. This was caused by the agitation of major players pushing to cover short positions. At noon, compared to the previous day, the British gold was reduced by 3125, the US dollar was reduced by 6875, and the Japanese gold rose by 3 fen. Chinese gold businesses such as Hengxing, Shengda, Fuchang, and Yufeng Yong were all buying to cover previous short positions. Some also套出 gold, and transactions were brisk. The turnover of British gold was more than 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Huabi, Shanghai, Maccari, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Zhengjin, Zhejiang, and Citibank all sold. Transactions between banks were tens of thousands of pounds, and US dollars were more than 100,000 yuan. However, there was little business from Chinese firms. Japanese gold was chased by the Dalian gang for hundreds of thousands of yuan. The market was extremely sharp, and the listed price had not been changed for many days, but yesterday it finally saw a reduction. Because it was Wednesday afternoon</p>

<p>Observing its Trend... Difficult to Develop</p>
<p>The yarn market was soft in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The trend was still soft. The price of foreign Three Goods yarn was trending down, and the distant months were falling sharply, causing discouragement. The selling pressure was still heavy, so the market atmosphere was still weak. The sales of yarn are clearer than before, but some yarn factories directly ship huge amounts, so the major buyers are calm and have no intention of letting go. The future still depends on the exchange rate and actual needs.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Shape is Slightly Soft. The Human Standard market opened in the morning, and the atmosphere was not encouraged by extra cotton. The price of foreign Three Goods yarn was trending down, and the selling atmosphere was slightly stronger, falling 6 mace to 1 tael 1 mace. After noon, it was heard that the gold price was trending up, and the market atmosphere was tight again, rising 2.39 mace. The total turnover for the day was 21,450 bales. The sellers were Tongyu 550 bales, Mingde 600 bales, Shenyu 800 bales, Senkang 850 bales, Yiyu 600 bales, Xiesheng 600 bales, and Yongda 600 bales. The buyers were Yuda 1,150 bales, Jifeng 850 bales, Heshen 750 bales, and Gengfeng 1,200 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market is very tight, and the situation is quite firm. The exchange rate relationship and the rising gold price have made the foreign cotton market weak. However, the cost of silver is still expensive, making it difficult to import. The inventory in this port is very low, so the market situation has suddenly become firm with slightly good news. The sellers are panicking because the inventory is too low. If the exchange rate does not rise, there may be major changes in the future.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Was Driven High by the Gold Market. The exchange Han Standard market opened flat in the morning. Because the foreign cotton market was not good, the market atmosphere softened. The current month fell by 5 points, and the distant month was flat. After noon, it was heard that the gold price was rising, and people's hearts were firm and rising. The market atmosphere was very tight, and each month rose by 3.4 mace. The turnover was 48,700 dan. The sellers were Gongtai 2,000 dan, Tongxing 1,600 dan, Changfeng 2,000 dan, Yiyu 1,700 dan, and Xincheng 1,400 dan.

<h3 id="e194">Food: Rice Market's Falling Trend Accelerates <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of river arrivals was around 50, and the market sales became more stagnant. The falling trend of white japonica was even more severe. The high-quality ones fell back significantly, while the medium and low-quality ones needed to be small. The shape of the market turned tight and went straight down. The source of Bo Dao's arrival was clear and weak, and the accumulation was thick, making it difficult to sell. The price of Yang Du Jian and the tips from other ports also turned weak, and the sales were extremely soft. The price also weakened by 1 jiao. The Yin Yuan situation was also bad, and the large market went down by nearly 1 jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, goods arrived from all directions. The sales on this street were uniformly stagnant. Chang Su and other white japonica varieties fell back slightly because the stock was relatively weak. The Southern Gang thin early rice was very sluggish, and the market shortened by 1 to 2 jiao. Yang Du Xian and Bai Yuan were consistently stagnant, and the prices were high, flat, and low in turn.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Standard Flour's Extreme Weakness Generates Reaction <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Payment of Margin Was Postponed for the Morning Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market did not open in the morning because the long positions' margin had not been paid in full. The exchange took the necessary measures and suspended the market for half a day. Until the afternoon, when the margin had been paid successively, it opened as usual. At that time, the trend was initially strong because the foreign wheat price was up by 2-3 corners, and the bearish hearts had already turned strong. However, at the beginning of the market, a certain factory sold off more than 100,000 units along with the market, so the market atmosphere was not good at first. However, after the second market, the buying atmosphere was very active. Because the current flour price of the factory still needs 2 taels and 1 mace (Tianjin Gang and this street entered 50,000 bags), the mainland and the Yangtze River Gang Tianjin Gang</p>

<p>Due to the renewed rise in the gold market yesterday, the prices in the piece goods market also showed a direct upward trend. Eastern goods like fine serge continued to rise by five li. White crepe became even more popular and profitable. Copper patterns already required four taels and three qian, "Ren Gou" (Human Dog) four taels and one qian and a half, "Jiao Ye Ti Shu" (Banana Leaf Inscription) four taels and one qian, and "Mo Gan Shan" four taels and five fen. Both local and visiting merchants were actively stocking up. Tribute woolen cloth like "Mo Gan Shan" and "Lie Yan" (Hunting Goose) had already been sold at three qian and six fen. "Shuang Tong Lu" (Double Child Deer) was at three qian and two and a half fen. Blue striped "Se Ting" was gradually increasing due to the approaching sales season. Yesterday, merchants from the Yangtze River region were actively sourcing these goods. "Zi Jin Shan," "Han Shan Si," and "Mo Gan Shan" were all at two qian and three fen. Miscellaneous colored tribute woolen cloth from outside the customs suddenly rose to three qian and two and a half fen. Fine cloth gradually stabilized, but floral cloth did not see much success or failure. "Shuang Tong Lu" and other types were mostly sold at around five taels and five qian. White thick cloth continued to rise, reaching three qian and three and a half fen for "Da Mo Shi Zi" (Bodhidharma Lion), which is considered a rare high price in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Metals: Market Condition Driven Up by Gold Market <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Transactions in the metal market have been quite slow recently, mainly due to sluggish sales. However, the rapid changes in the market are also rare in recent years. Yesterday, the gold market frequently rose, and the standards in various metal markets were also driven up considerably. "Dong Bai Tou" (Eastern White Head) quoted prices have risen by one fen per sheet, such as six chi at nine qian and seven fen, and seven chi at one tael, one qian, and seven fen. English "Ma Kou Tie" (Horse Mouth Iron) at ninety pounds also rose by one qian, selling for sixteen taels. No. 26 Japanese sheet iron also increased from sixteen taels and two and a half qian to sixteen taels and four qian. Other plain white iron and triangular iron also increased by one qian to five fen. Even sluggish green lead and tin showed a tendency to rise yesterday. Although the quantity of goods opened yesterday was very small, the trend was much firmer than before.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Sugar Market: All Types of Sugar Rise One Qian <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: Cuban raw sugar prices fell compared to the previous day by 1.75. New York futures sugar for May and March both rose one fen, and September rose two fen. Java spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The guild's quotations for Dutch sugar No. 24, excluding coarse granulated white, rose due to high foreign exchange rates, and buying interest gradually increased. The transaction price was ten taels and two qian and a half, an increase of one qian from the previous day, and the market shape was charming. Medium granulated white sugar still saw little trading, but the trend was also stable. "Ri Jing" (Daily Essence) transactions were quite active, and the market also gradually rose. "Z Mark" ten taels and one qian, "SH Mark" nine taels and seven qian and a half, "YRO Mark" nine taels and one qian, "YT Mark" ten taels and six and a half to five fen, "YP Mark" ten taels and two and a half to three qian, "V Mark" ten taels and three and a half qian. The market situation was also very firm. Very few "Hao Pan" transactions. "Guo Hua Ben Chang" (Guohua Original Factory) quoted the price for ice flower green at seven taels and six qian. "Nan Sheng Long" opened the price for ice flower green at seven taels and nine qian. Although each had sales, the buyers were very quiet and the market felt stable, not strange.</p>
<h3 id="e199">North and South Goods: Black Watermelon Seeds Quoted Tightly and Charmingly <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Recently, black watermelon seeds have been arriving in small quantities, and the market inventory is also scarce, so the quotations are quite tight and unwilling to open much. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang gang only opened 280 packages of Dangshan seeds, with the price rising to ten taels. Recently, sales among various gangs have become active, especially the Fujian and Guangdong gangs. They have handled nearly a thousand packages in recent days, with prices ranging from twelve to eleven taels and ninety taels and four qian, so the future market is bound to rise again. Yesterday, the market price for "Ji Kui Zi" (Ji Kui Seeds) was sixteen taels, "Ji Zhong Zi" (Ji Zhong Seeds) fourteen taels, "Xu Kui Zi" (Xu Kui Seeds) eleven taels and six, "Dangshan Zi" (Dangshan Seeds) twelve taels, and "Zhong Che Zi Da Lian Yu" (Zhong Che Zi Dalian Yu) all nine taels and four qian.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Silk and Tea: Long Filature Prices Increasingly Charming and Profitable <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Various silk factories in this port and other places have mostly suspended operations due to the slump in European sales, scarce raw materials, and increasingly heavy costs and losses. Currently, it is estimated that less than six out of ten silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are operating. The production of long filature silk from silk factories is decreasing, while demand from France remains high, and supply cannot meet demand, so the market price is charming and profitable. Yesterday, Xinfu imported 25 dan of high-grade long filature from Wuxi, and the price had risen to one hundred and ninety-two taels.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Foreign Firm Silk Sales Unlikely to Become Smooth <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of foreign firm silk in this port still lacked the possibility of becoming smooth. The raw silk consumption of various overseas silk weaving factories is decreasing daily, and factory purchases remain slack. Telegrams relay that silk prices are not high, and Chinese merchants' willingness to sell is very weak. Yesterday, only Liana imported ten packages of Shanghai white filature, and Kaili and others imported fifteen packages of Shanghai yellow filature, and Gao Bei imported fourteen packages of coarse yellow silk. Prices remained stable.</p>

<p>--- Text</p>
<p>The fashion of academic research is indeed an indispensable factor for us today. We acknowledge that under the modern education system, relying solely on books or lectures can by no means satisfy our thirst for knowledge. We must seek other ways to develop and avoid the pain of suffocation. Therefore, extracurricular activities are indeed a quality we eagerly need. There, we can explore a new expression of life that cannot be obtained in the bustling classroom. Therefore, the general urgency of young students in organizing academic groups within or outside the school should be consciously pursued after realizing this point. Although, if we put in some effort to analyze it in detail, it would not be so simple, but the superficial exposure is mostly like this. The Guangming Society of the College of Political Science and Law is a product of this. It is an outstanding one among the academic groups in the College of Political Science and Law. I remember having introduced it here before. Their concerted efforts in their work are indeed worthy of admiration. Since the beginning of this semester, although the work has been interrupted for some time due to certain reasons, recently it has revived its inherent spirit and reorganized its affairs. A fundraising committee has been resolved in the executive committee to raise funds from inside and outside the school to subsidize the shortage of funds, which is now underway. The second is to organize a spring break travel group, wanting to throw themselves into the arms of West Lake in the great spring light and indulge for a while. Another important thing is to plan to publish a yearbook as a memorial, with the carefully crafted works of the members published, with about 100,000 words. It has been handed over to Zhu Airen and Li Chunsen of the publishing department to plan everything. If it can be realized, it will be very meaningful, and the expression of this kind of work is also closely related to the reputation of the school. The essay competition was set up by the society to increase interest. The topic was "Youth and Politics." Students inside and outside the society enthusiastically submitted articles, and a total of 57 essays were received. Originally, there were prizes for the top three, but now because there are so many good works, it is unbearable to go against the general elegance, so the prize amount was temporarily expanded by three. After evaluation, the results were: first place, Zhu Jianbai, prize: a silver shield with the inscription "Substance in Words"; second place, Li Ming, prize: a silver frame with the inscription "Containing Essence and Chewing Flowers"; third place, Lu Chaofan, prize: a silk banner with the inscription "Brush Sweeps a Thousand Armies"; fourth place, Meng Berlin; fifth place, Shun; sixth place, Wang Shiying, each prize: a "Vanguard Monthly." This move is a pioneering one among the academic groups in the College of Political Science and Law.</p>
<h3 id="e204">To West Lake <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Su Jun</p>
<p>Extreme neurasthenia made me begin to get tired of the city. Squeezed in a crowded streetcar, my head was dizzy, my chest could not breathe, and my heart felt like vomiting.</p>
<p>—Go to West Lake and stay for a while. I was sick, really sick. In the vibration of the streetcar, I thought to myself. Back in the house, I told Hai and Zou. They were shocked. "Fun!" Zou jumped up and said, "Suddenly thinking of going to West Lake again. West Lake is still very lonely at this time."</p>
<p>"You," Hai said, "you admirer of the city, you are going to admire nature again?"</p>
<p>"I'm sick," I replied to them, "because I've been too far away from nature. I want to be soothed in the embrace of nature. I want to escape the noise. Loneliness is useful to me."</p>
<p>"Then you really decided to go?" they asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "and I'm going tomorrow."</p>
<p>They were silent with shock.</p>
<p>In the morning, Hai put me on the bus.</p>
<p>"Hey," Hai said to me, "You go. If you say West Lake is better to live in than Shanghai, I will come too."</p>
<p>"But," I said, "West Lake is too poetic. I don't want to live there for a long time. I just want to clear my mind and let the fresher air soothe me. I will still come back. I can't leave the city because I can't leave the real life of the world."</p>
<p>The bus was about to leave. Hai went down for a while and then came back to give me a bunch of bananas and a newspaper. Then the bus wriggled. I shook Hai's hand. "Goodbye, Hai." Goodbye, Shanghai.</p>
<p>After five hours of driving, the bus arrived at the train station.</p>
<p>After unloading my luggage at a hotel, I went to see West Lake. Ah, West Lake is already in spring. The willows on Su Causeway are green, and the tourists in the lakeside park are wearing thin jackets...</p>
<p>Passing through Bai Causeway, passing the gate of the National Art College, there was the sound of piano jumping out from the wall. Young female students were walking. They are worthy of pride. I quickly walked past them so they wouldn't know I was there. I found Mr. Xu in Yu Lou.</p>
<p>"Ah," Mr. Xu exclaimed strangely, "how did you come?"</p>
<p>I was very ashamed and uneasy. A year ago, I had argued with Mr. Xu over a small matter that people wouldn't believe. Now I've run to him again. I don't know if he still remembers those past events.</p>
<p>With Mr. Xu and the others, after passing Inner West Lake and Yue Fei's tomb, we found a small house at the foot of Qixia Ridge. It was next to a ancestral hall, near the cemetery. The environment was quiet and solemn, but close to West Lake. Through the bars of the iron gate, we could see the flowing water of West Lake, calm and clear, like lively eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Youth Zone Guidelines <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
