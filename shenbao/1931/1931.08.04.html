<p>募助捐欵。急救水災。或有視爲消極工作。無關宏旨者。亦有以連年災禍捐助多次。茲復募賑。實不勝其煩凟者。斯說似然而實不然。夫致力建。設。預防天災。槖戢干戈。杜絶人禍。固根本之大計。積極之建設也。然方今國家多故。致此未能。則有災即賑。乃爲積極。况萬千災黎。浮沉洪流。仰企蒼天。忍死待救。節我不必之消費。拯彼待死之災黎。一錢之施。一物之助。在災黎皆爲有益。毫不落空。多救一人。即多活一命。多救十人。即多活十命。事實照陳。有目共見。拯萬千生命於水火。吾果安能謂爲非積極。至於多次捐助。不耐煩凟。一念之倦。萬千災黎之生命繫之。影響之巨。有如是者。存此念者。尤應深思。此次被水災區。廣達十六省。災民至少在五千萬人以上。較之歷年各地災况。尤爲倍之。前此旣已捐助。此次更應捐助。蓋捐欵拯災。非爲示恩。而實爲人類應有之互助。應具之同情。人忍死以待我救。我則安坐晏居。傲然謂不耐此煩凟。試一沉思。於心安否</p>
<p>今日對水災積極救濟之法。第一爲全國人士總動員。災區廣闊·災民衆多。如積薪燎原·决非杯水所能救。必全國人士全體動員。有錢者捐錢。有力者助力。集合衆力。共起急救。乃能有成。第二爲各地公私慈善機關。應協力合作。其理由在前「急救水災」一評中。旣已言之。蓋力分則効微。力合則効宏。而且估量全力。統籌全局。庶賑施乃得酌其緩急。支配均平。第三爲不限地域。普遍賑濟。同爲災民。無分彼此同待拯救。無分輕重。故賑濟應普應均。若此處得救。而他處向隅。此處得生。而他處仍不免於死。則失之均平。</p>
<p>抑有進者。縱觀我國歷史上之民變。大多迫於飢饉。方今累年離亂。人心動搖。益以災禍。危機更多。亟謀補救。或尙可爲。若亂象一成。則將一發而不可收拾國人其勿明於近利·而惑於遠害。記者謹再四敬告國人。</p>

<p>市上所售的冰忌廉。大半是果味的。如香蕉檸檬橘子桑子之類。甘香可口。確是我們夏問的恩物。但是美國某大城中。却新翻花樣。製成好幾種蔬菜的冰忌廉。如蘿蔔　菜芹菜等等。别有風味。大受士女們的歡迎。</p>
<p>陳飾漂亮的禮拜堂</p>
<p>現代的靑年男女。都喜歡及時行樂。跳舞塲與夜總會。趨之若鶩。對於沈悶呆板的禮拜堂視爲畏途。英國聖約翰禮拜堂的主持者。有鑒於此。特費七千金鎊。在堂中舖設橙黃的地毯。裝置碧綠的椅座。并將墻壁粉刷得異常富麗。據說可以吸引一般年靑的男女。</p>
<h3 id="c111">我所知之江陰怪翁 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 張功元</p>
<p>日前自由談載棲鳳　樓主誌江陰夜宿棺柩之怪翁一節。想係得自傳聞。以余所知。大異於是。余江陰人。去歲復曾與怪翁一面。爰述始末。以爲更正。</p>
<p>翁居江陰南鄉之月城橋。距吾鄉賢莊翔聲先生之課孫别墅約半里。去夏余因事拜謁莊先生。晚來偕與閒步。偶過翁居。遇翁於門。翁因邀入小坐。仰視其居。乃一祠宇。至中堂。有神一座。廣六七尺。中供神主。龕下漆棺一具。入土者半。棺蓋旁置。棺内衣衾全備。鋪墊整齊。心竊異之。亦不便問。稍坐辭出。歸途以詢莊先生。先生爲詳述一一。因得詳悉翁之身世及置棺始末。蓋翁少孤。稍識字。家貧。自翁成立。勤儉刻苦。致力耕耘。四十歲前。僅至城垣兩次。漸以起家。至七十歲時。已有良田百餘畝。民國十四五年間。翁忽劃其田爲三分。一分以畀子。二分則盡數售去以其資建立家祠。當地士紳。深爲贊美。翁則慨然言曰。木有根本。水有源流。人獨可不知思親乎。余不幸。不獲事父母。今之所爲。乃人子應盡之責耳。翁有子。年三十許亦能持家。惟翁常謂其不肖。鄰人問之。則曰。吾憑赤手空拳。努力五十餘年。能有今日。今吾子乃不能繼吾之志。奮發有爲。徒襲吾餘蔭。飽食安居。將以終老。非不肖而何。因與子媳分居。獨携五六歲孫居祠中。不問家事。翁生性孤僻。見解異人。當祠宇落成之日。即購置棺木衣衾及其他身後之物。埋半棺於神龕下。人問其故。翁曰。吾風燭殘年。旦夕可死。且心事已了。吾復何戀。所難者。惟不知何時何日爲死期耳。今吾豫爲之計。則隨時可死。隨時可置棺中。且不致因我身後之事。而累我後人。於我於子孫。兩有裨益。至於所以埋棺龕下者。蓋吾將來即埋葬於此龕下。吾已告吾子孫。諒子孫雖不肖。將來亦必能從吾遺命。吾生不獲事吾親。終天之恨。如此則死後得常依列祖列宗膝下。免吾遺憾。吾不願葬於山邱。與異姓之鬼爲伍。而祖宗得吾伴侍。亦不至凄凉凉孤寂。兩得其便。不亦美哉。此吾所以埋棺龕下也。翁今年七十六七。望之若五十許人。飲食如壯者。步履矯疾。若非嚴寒酷暑。猶能以半日時間。往返城鄉三十餘里。是亦我國人瑞。若有人能表而揚之。余知其必能捹民風而礪薄俗也。（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="c113">洪楊和紅羊 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>太平天國的兩個首事者。恰巧一個姓洪。（秀全）一個姓楊。（秀清）因而談太平事蹟的。都稱爲洪楊之役或紅羊之役。在一般大意的人。總以爲紅羊是洪楊之音諧。先有洪楊而後有紅羊。其實不然。乃是在未有洪楊之先。已有了紅羊這個名詞。所以說是恰巧。有一天。友人某君君一篇太平天國時代的軼事。特在標題之上加上「紅羊軼聞」四小字。面交給我。要我在某報上發表。我看了那四小字。戲問他紅羊是什麽意思。他却正色說道。紅羊就是洪楊。還要問的什麽。我道。爲何不寫洪楊呢。他道。一樣的。可以隨便寫。不過寫紅羊覺得别致而已。我也道。這是誰敎你的呢。他竟不耐煩似的道。這個何須别人敎我。洪楊紅羊。不是一樣麽。我看見他人寫爲紅羊已不知多少次。無非同「以」字寫作「㠯」。「法」字寫作「灋」一樣罷。了你偏要和我胡纏。我見他已由不耐煩進而含有怒意。祗好不再胡纏。一笑而罷。現在我想起來。恐怕靑年學子誤會洪楊與紅羊爲一而二二而一的必定還有。不妨在這裏解釋一下。原來在趙宋理宗淳祐時。有一個柴望。編了一部書。呌做丙丁龜鑑。上自泰莊襄王五十二年丙午。下迄五代漢天福十二年丁未。共一千二百六十年。其間有二十一年是丙午丁未。恰巧逢到這年。國内都有亂事。所以名爲丙丁龜鑑。柴望編成後。特進呈理宗。希望理宗看了。資爲前車之鑑。不可失政。後人以丙屬火色。赤未爲羊。便通稱國家有禍亂時爲紅羊。刧年。太平天國首事者之姓。適與紅羊同音。昔人又都王清室而寇太平。便　也目爲紅羊之刼了。某君所撰之稿。還對太平有相當的尊崇。錄及孫中山爲太平天國戰史所作的序。如果明白了紅羊二字的來歷和意義。就不會發怒而要啞然失笑了。呵呵。</p>

<p>當回敎未入印度以前。希臘人曾治印度二百年之久。此小島乃如此强。可怪也。吾人學于印度、未聞印度學于何人。彼有名之學者。名阿利哈他Aryabhata。曾學算于希臘。友人言有「印度與希臘」一書。惜余未及見之。又當回敎以前。有學者北克哈拉Bhaskarrbarya已知地圓之說。玄裝法顯。均在印度史上爲貴客。彼等著有印度之書也。</p>
<p>佛敎與印度敎興衰之故。大可研究。（一）印度敎敬牛而殺羊。佛一律禁殺。（二）佛敎努力遣信徒傳布外國。印度敎無之。（今大傳于美蓋變化矣）（三）佛敎用各種文字廣傳。昔印度敎無之。其佛敎所以衰之。故一經年久。僧人地位高。　傲腐化。漸失羣衆之信仰故也。物盛則衰。佛敎亦如此者耳。二外人有扶助印度敎者。三印度敎于中興時出僧加亞拉。Shanker　Acharya故佛敎被其壓倒。逐出印度以外。僅保殘喘于南之錫蘭。北之雪山附近也。</p>
<p>至尼乾子與佛敎之異同。則尼乾子之創作者。亦爲一王子出家者。故稱子者。著其名族也。其國之族姓名沙都拉。Kshalriya王子與佛爲凈飯王子。同地位也。二其戒敎信湼槃之說同。而其異點則佛徒信三寶。尼乾敎所信之三寶爲正信正智正行爲也。又尼乾敎信餓死爲解脫之善法。佛不以爲然。</p>
<p>五日與學生等遊恒河。其水澄清。春期流甚緩。北有紅鐵橋。望之而未過也。恒河邊又名爲羅漢韋。蓋一切聖者修行之所。有撑一大傘而坐臥其下者。有据不臺者。有臥于小室者。有殘廢坐乞者。塗面額成五色。其髮自然成辮。想不梳之故。女子亦有之游客亦不少。有賣道書者。亦有賣糖食者。亦有說書者。學生云。彼有一親戚今成仙矣。我近彼前。彼不向我交語。余乃往觀之。則見衆人圍繞一坐修者。渾身只勒一繩。與前陰之二寸布條。正坐不語。身亦不十分瘦。想亦進食也。但不閉目而行深呼吸。面前有木柴。蓋佛經所謂事火敎也。雙跌正坐。余立良久。未見他異。復前行矣。余常研究動物學。蛇之盤。蛙之蟄。虫之冬眠。皆可數月不食。如死人然。修道这工夫深者。亦如此耳。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>時候已經不早，他料想着丁小姐一定在熱烈地盼望着他了。但是，摸摸自己的衣袋裏，就想着還有一件緊要的事情没有做得。當時，他就急匆匆地跳上了電車，一直到大馬路下來·</p>
<p>走進了一家銀樓，他慚愧地掏出他袋裏的三件金器來，就對店夥說：「這幾件東西，都不入時了，給我兌了現吧！」</p>
<p>店夥拿了起來，細細地看過，擺在天平秤上秤過，又細細地算過，才說：「一共一兩四錢理，照今天收進的市價，算起來，合着一百三十九元四角五分。」</p>
<p>他已經很滿意了，一面貨銀兩清之後，他又說：「給我拿幾隻鑽戒出來看看！」</p>
<p>那個店夥就換了一種神氣，很敄柔和地說：「請裏邊坐吧！」</p>
<p>到了裏邊去，店夥就指着一個玻璃櫃子裏，呌他自己揀選·他看看櫃子裏，很整齊地排列着許多小小的匣子，匣子裏全是一隻一隻的鑽戒，大的也有，小的也有，幾粒合鑲的也有，單粒獨嵌的也有。他覺得隻隻都合意，只不知揀了那一隻好。一轉念，又想到了自己的錢不多，益發覺得爲難。最後，他才指着一隻比較小一些的，呌店夥拿出來看。</p>
<p>「一百九十五元！」店夥看了一看匣子底下寫着的號碼，就這樣唸了出來。</p>
<p>「那是太貴了！」他自己想。「有没有便宜一些的呢？」他接着問。</p>
<p>「便宜的也有丨只不知道先生大槪預備多少錢左右？」店夥說。</p>
<p>「一百元出頭些也好！」</p>
<p>最後、終于揀定了一隻，他付出了一百十二元七角，總算鑽戒是如願以償了。</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>走出銀樓的大門，身上好像覺得輕鬆了許多，心上也也好像覺得寬舒了許多·立刻就雇了一輛人力車，到同孚路去，價也不講，只吩咐着車夫快快地跑。</p>
<p>一邊，丁小姐果然已經等了許久時候了。正在不耐煩的當兒，忽然聽得電鈴響了起來，伊就吩咐秋子去開門。</p>
<p>秋子回了進來，從驚奇的神情中報告丁小姐說：「外面來的是一位李先生！」</p>
<p>「你回絶了他麽？」丁小姐很不高興</p>
<p>「是的！我知道今天小姐是不會會見旁的客人了，所以，我已經回絶了他，只說不在家裏。」秋子微微地笑首。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼漲之象、以洋麥報價祗好一二角左右、大部份因前週末、廠家大批出檔、不免戒懼、後以各處水災、依然方興未艾、高郵開壩、長江一帶、水量有增無减、致買氣復活、步步吸收、廠家方面、靜趨觀望、出檔甚少、觀察後步、當可暫呈定悞、以内地帮之勇氣、尙未入衰殆也、結果本月份較前週末未動、九月份好五厘、十月份好一分十一·十二月份好一分二釐半、正月份好一分七釐半、</p>
<h3 id="c125">麥市又見飛騰 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>現貨做開萬三千包</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面上午開盤後、各月份較前週收盤無甚上落、因洋麥報價、祗好一二角左右、買賣雙方觀望居多、惟盤旋之中、略帶堅定、迨至下午開盤、以上午粉　之轉佳、又因洋麥之兜售、無人活動、致一般内地帮終因各處水災之重大、層層爭買、所以各盤開價又見飛騰、雖廠家有洋麥套賣、市氣則依然堅挺也、結果本月份較前週漲五分、九·十月份漲七分、十一·十二月份漲六分、現麥因到源不繼、存底日虚、産地合申、已近七錢至八錢故高貨亦喊至七錢二三分、中次仍平、開蓬萊·安慶·丹陽·戚堰·鎭江·浦東·常熟·太倉·揚州·雙鳳·南京·崑山等麥一萬三千餘包、由申大信大辦六千包、福新辦四千包、華豐辦三千餘包云、</p>

<p>美國向爲生絲銷費最巨之國、紐約絲織廠林立、需絲尤旺、月須五六萬包、入夏以來、暑熱異常、絲織廠停工、生絲銷費大减、上月份中日義法等國、生絲共祇消費四萬二千五百包、較最旺之月、須减二萬包弱云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、永興·保昌·錦隆·協和等行·　意益趨濃厚、全市交易異常旺盛市盤繼續堅漲六七兩洋茶商因市上存貨不多、來源有限、態度愈形堅硬、針眉秀眉等貨、因本年内地茶末價佳、額數稀少、現市頗有供不應求之勢、此外貢熙一項、昨日俄國協助會洋行、又復調查新樣、預備開辦、綠茶市勢、漸呈佳象云、</p>

<p>五金交易、昨仍平淡、致全市除少許點綴外、大宗買賣、依然寥寡、惟到貨一節、昨日大小馬、口鐵又到二千四五百箱、行情一項、恐此後難有提漲之望、現市九十磅美貨估十五兩七錢半、一百磅十七兩、英貨則九十磅估十四兩、一百磅十五兩五錢、二百磅三十兩、交易廠家甚多、而客帮點綴、殊覺寥落云、</p>

<h3 id="c216">超人哲學淺說 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 禹揚</p>
<p>李石岑著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>昨天偶然在商務印書館看到一本李石岑先生著的新出版的超人哲學淺說、這使我非常高興、關於尼采思想研究的書籍、在國内差不多可以說没有、（短篇的介紹文章除外）、李石岑先生素以介紹尼采學說著名的、並且聽說最近曾在德京作過長期的研討生活、他寫這本書是何等適切而有味啊、我購了牠回去之後、高興地把牠一口氣讀完、覺得牠雖是廖廖不滿百頁（九十四頁）的小冊子、而從此可以窺見超卓絶倫的超人哲學家之思想的大槪、給我們這衰老的民族打一口强心針、因此情不自禁把牠介紹出來、</p>
<p>作者爲什麽要介紹這超人哲學家的思想、我們在緒言第一頁便看到這樣的說話、</p>
<p>我所以要亟亟於介紹尼采思想的意思、說來雖是很複雜、大體的說、即未嘗不可以分作幾項說明、</p>
<p>（一）尼采做超人哲學的意思、是爲的全人類太委靡、太廉價、太尙空想、太貪安逸、我願介紹超人哲學的意思、是爲的中國太委靡、太廉價、太尙空想、太貪安逸、……</p>
<p>（二）中國民族的最朋的弱點、是帶有妥協、微温的性質、在表面看來、這是中庸、這是平和、而在實際上看來、這只是鄉愿和奴隸之劣根性之暴露、此種根性、相沿已久、非有一種絶大的刺激和澈底的覺悟、是不容易蘇醒過來的、這是我介紹尼采思想的第二個原因、</p>
<p>（三）尼采的哲學是一種反抗啠學、是一種反價值的哲學、尼采呌做（一切的重新估定、」但尼采的反抗的目標、是吃人的基督敎、本書却是想抨擊吃人的禮敎、……</p>
<p>（四）中國民族表面上並不信奉任何宗敎、骨子裏却信奉多神敎、……尼采便一聲喝破「凟神是可以的、因爲神早死了、」這是何等有力的箴言、不把多神敎的思想打破、則科學的威權是無法施展的、這是我介紹尼采思想的第四個原因、</p>
<p>尼采的思想、在歐戰後很遭人咒駡、以爲牠可以助長戰爭、這全是矯枉過的言論、在中國更不應作如是想、而應該誠意歡迎這崇高偉大的思想、以振廢起衰、</p>
<p>全書的榸成、分作下面這幾章、（一）緒言、（二）尼采小傳、（三）尼采思想發展的程序、（四）尼采與斯迪納、（五）尼采與叔本華、（六）尼采的人生觀、（七）尼采的宇宙觀、（八）尼采的價值觀、（九）尼采的進化觀、（十）尼采的道德觀、（十）（一）尼采的藝術觀、（十）（二）結論、這是很自然而朕括的、請在下面加以簡單的說明、</p>
<p>在「尼采的小傳」裏面、純從簡單思想方面以叙述這位超人哲學的平生、而歸結到「尼采的自我思想、並非從病苦孤獨和憂鬱而來、乃從他的人格的本質而來、由他的人格的本質、遂産生他的「眞實」與「偉大」」的結論、作者眞是尼采的知己、在「尼采思想發展的程序」裏面、先把尼采所相信的進化原則——以爲人生三十之年、亦必須將人類第一祖先至現代的人類三千年間之進化程序重演一回、——作尼采自身的思想之發展的說明、而以尼采的著作爲左證、第一期所代表的爲「悲劇之發生」與「過時代的考察」、第二角所代表的爲「人樣的太人樣的」與「曙光」、第三期所代表的爲「愉快的智慧」、查拉圖斯特拉這樣說、「善惡的彼岸」、「道德的系統」、「瓦格訥的事件」、「偶像的黎明」、尼采對瓦格訥」、「反對基督敎徒」與「看這個人」、這是一種有系統的排列、跟着更把這些著作加以說明、而認定「第一個時期是浪漫主義時期、第二個時期是自然主義時期、第三個時期是新浪漫主義的時期、」以第三時芿爲最重要、而第一二時期也不容忽視、這一章毫不費力地把這超人哲學家複雜的思想的發展程序說得清清楚楚、在讀者方面是何等愉快的事、</p>
<p>「尼采與斯迪訥」與（尼采與叔本華」兩章、是說明叔本華是啓導尼采哲學的出發點、斯迪訥啓導尼采哲學的全部、斯迪訥發現「宇宙間眞實存在的、只我自我」、尼采便接受斯迪訥的主張而成就他的超人哲學、尼采承繼叔本華的意志論、而把牠更爲擴大、把叔本華的生活意志說一變而爲權力意志說、這兩章說明尼采和他兩個人思想的關係、對於尼采的學說作溯本尋源的採討、</p>
<p>從第六至第十一這幾章、是本書的中心點、叙述「尼采的人生觀」拿「悲劇的發生」一本書作根據、認定這本書爲（一）古典言語學、（二）叔本華的意志哲學、（三）瓦格訥的音樂的影響的結晶、由古典言語學而得到希臘兩種精神上的潮流、—以美的神和酒的神作這兩種精神的代表、演爲靜美的世界和意志的世界、—由叔本華的意志哲學而啓發權力意志的思想、由瓦格訥的音樂而促進藝術上的趣味、由這三種的影響、成就尼采的人生觀、—人生的第一要義、是在對於人生取挑戰的態度、是在用最大的痛苦、換取高貴的人生、這章的結末、更拿尼采的人生觀來批評中國人的人生觀、講到「尼采的宇宙觀、」先叙述尼采用銳利勇邁的眼光打破從來從幻影崇拜病出發的一切的「實在的思想」、（宇宙的本體）建設他自己的「永遠輪廻說」、謂宇宙之眞相是必然的、决定的、宿命的、盲目的、尼采的着重點、是要把宇宙說得極陳死、極無意義、然後由超人把牠一手挽回來、陳死的給牠蘇生過來、無意義的給牠豐富一些意義、所以超人貴在與死神戰、與運命戰、與永遠輪廻作记澎之戰、</p>
<p>在「民采的價值觀」裏把他的主着「查拉圖斯特拉這說」所發表的超人哲學做說明、他只看重地不看重天、只看重肉不看重靈、重新估定價值的標準、以爲比較的能使「生」美化的爲善、否則爲惡、比較的能使「生」强化的是善、否則爲惡、比較能使「生」充溢而擴大的是善、否則爲惡、以這樣的思想來批評中國人的價值觀念的、確一無是處、了「尼采的進化觀、」說明他的觀察和達爾文相伈、—由人類可以進化到超人、但其兩個最大的分界、達爾文以爲人生爲生存競爭、尼采以爲人生更有爲生存以上的競爭、達爾文置重外界之勢力、以環境爲進化之原因、尼采置重内部之勢力、以權力意志爲進化之原因、這是一種很有力量的說明、</p>
<p>「尼采的道德觀」一章裏根據他所著「善惡的彼岸」分道德爲兩類、（一）爲偉人的道德、（二）爲奴隸的道德、所謂偉人的道德、便是圖積極自我的肯定、本能的滿足、具有最高價值的道德、反之、奴隸的道德、是徒藉多數的勢力、上帝的啓示、國家的權威、社會的傳說、以壓迫强者大者使人類日即於墮落腐化的、絶無價值的道德、偉人的道德、即是「戰的道德」、而所謂戰、是爲人類而戰、爲人生而戰、爲超人而戰、這是戰的道德的標準、尼采更把戰的程序分爲三種、（一）由精神變爲駱駝、（二）由駱駝變爲獅子、（三）由獅子變爲小孩子、所以戰的道德、也具備這三種精神、最後、「尼采的藝術觀」、說明尼采特别看重生活的藝術、和他所發見的藝的本質、與藝術家所不可缺的要素、這兩章都把尼采的思想來批評中國人的道德觀念、藝術觀念、</p>
<p>全書的結論、把尼采和·斯迪訥·基爾克哥德的十九世紀有名的三個個人主義作一個簡單比較、以闡明個人主義的眞意義、作者更大聲疾呼說、</p>
<p>「中國人一聽到個人主義這個名詞、便會聨想到自私自利、以爲這是不祥之物、殊不知個人主義、其主旨在積極的肯定自我、肯定自我之人格、肯定自我之生命、自我肯定、使全世間肯定、便會覺悟到對世間應有一番責任、對我自己也應有一番責任、」</p>
<p>上面已經把超人哲學淺說這本書介紹過一個大槪、在讀這本書的時候、只有覺得、其介紹得極有系統、解說得極爲透闢、而筆鋒的犀利、詞藻的豐富、好像作者正在高據講壇作他令人忘倦的演講的時候的態度、作者在這本書的重要的幾章、結尾總把尼采的思想批評中國人的傳統觀念、讀時只覺得針針見血、痛快非常、中國這個民族在今日已入於衰老頽唐的狀態、人性的改造、較一切的改造尤爲重要、要改造人性、自非注入尼采這管工力十足的强心針不行、作者套尼采的調子說道、</p>
<p>「倘使你們不信尼采所宣傳的道理是眞的、那末你們這樣一類不覺悟的靑年、一定没有生存之理了、一</p>
<p>讀者有所感動麽、請你有暇時把這本書一加吟味罷、</p>

<h3 id="c219">到醫院 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 海帆</p>
<p>星期六（六月二十七日）上午九點十分鐘的時候、我因爲朋友開君的病、也就踏進了吳淞海邊一個醫院的門、首先給我們的一個印像、就是一位長不像東瓜和短不像南瓜的掛號處的人、到掛號的時間、却在忙自己的工作、經我們幾次的致問、他方始做他所應該做的事、</p>
<p>倒霉的人、（病人）眞是闖鬼、恰巧院長義爷（因他們的稱呼而知道）口啣着羅克烟咀、大搖大擺的來了、當到門邊的時候就說、你（指掛號的人）替我打個電話、到兵工廠去問汪先生（恕我没有聽清楚）替我介紹的生意、到底有没有、這一來、院長的打電話、自然是勝利、病人的掛號、也自然是失敗、那邊回來的電話說、生意有、并且還要出診、不過時間可以隨便、那曉得我們這位醫院的院長、聽到出診二字、不問時間怎樣、馬上就露着笑形的面孔、到院長室内換衣服去了、</p>
<p>這間院長室、是掛號處的對面、壁上又掛着寫了（院長室）三大字的牌子、加以是透明的玻璃窗、所以看得如此清楚、等到院長換好衣服的時候、掛號處掛外科號的病人、有二十幾位、不過儘是工友們、掛内科號的、却祇有我朋友開君一人、結果、院長臨出診的時候、抽了五分鐘（最多）獨替我朋友開君診察、使我不能不感謝、然而他在診斷上、忙寫了兩個糢糊的字、分不出是英文、抑還是德文、後面却加上了個（？）符號、使我又不能懐疑、因爲急於要知朋友是什麽病、就不能不間、</p>
<p>「院長、他到底是什麽病、」</p>
<p>他不獨不回答、連瞧也不瞧、就同他的女看婦、坐着兩把黄包車出診去了、</p>
<p>第二天開君的病加緊了、我爲着朋友的病、也就不能不忍氣吞聲的、仍舊跑到我碰釘子的那個醫院去打聽住院的規則、剛巧、遇着昨天那位很神氣的院長、迫我不得不呌一聲、</p>
<p>「院長、貴院還有不有比較安靜一點的房間嗎、」（指四人一室的房間而言）、</p>
<p>他却帶着譏諷而發怒的口氣、回答道、「我們這裏、不能爲了你的朋友、再造一所房子、」</p>
<p>我看他眞奇怪、有没有房間尙且還没有回答、用這種態度來對付人、正想反詰一句、可是他却走了、我爲了朋友的病、也祇得回校來了、</p>
<p>釘子又來一個、事情是、李家宅八號、住着一位姓王的、他是我的朋友、可說是我的至好、他有着特别的脾氣、很不喜和人交際、有時竟連話也都懶得和人講、同時、也有和旁人不同的瘧疾病、此病不發則已、不發就要昏倒、不獨口不能言、就是手足也祇能微微的動、眼睛呆的外表的情形、很像將死的人一般、不過呼氣不同罷了、</p>
<p>二十三日那天、因爲偶一不愼、就把他幾年來未曾發過的舊病帶發、情形和前講的一點也不差、所以同他居的人們、爲他都駭死了、想送醫院、又恐怕萬一不幸、没有人負責、不送醫院、就是見死不救、良心有愧　眞是左右爲難、踟躍了些工夫、方始來呌我、我看到那種樣子、也祇有主張送醫院的一法、然而進院、除了那個醫院上、又找不出有第二個時疫病所、俗云、「人到崖泉下、誰敢不低頭、」這就是我我的實况、走到那醫院時、恰巧遇着他們在吃飯、眞是時運不齊、命途多舛、掛號雖然是特别掛號、可是結果恰相反、得急症病的人、當然是不覺得、而腦筋清醒的人、在露天底下立等着半點鐘、眞有受不住、我想吃家常便飯未必比診急病還要來得緊急些嗎、</p>
<p>嗚呼、</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the First Route of the Northern Route Anti-Communist Army yesterday in Wangdu. After taking office, Yu led his troops to pursue and suppress Shi's army, arriving at Zhoujiazhuang that evening and moving to Shenze today. Part of Shi's forces is retreating from Anping, Raoyang, Zhaoxian, and Hengshui towards Botou and Sangyuan on the Jinpu Railway, awaiting Han Fuqu's disarmament and incorporation. Yu's army, together with Wang Shuchang's army, has formed a joint encirclement and plans to clear Shi's troops within Hebei Province within four days. Shi himself is mixed in with the troops, in a very disheveled state, and regrets his rash actions. He intends to discuss with Han Fuqu, appealing to their old friendship, to allow him to escape to Japan via Qingdao, while his troops are handed over to Han for incorporation. However, most of Shi's army is afraid of aircraft and travels by night, hiding during the day. Their current location is unknown. The Northeast has dispatched six aircraft to scout ahead for bombing purposes. The Pinghan Railway has suffered significant damage from Shi's army's looting and aerial bombardment. The railway administration has dispatched workers from Changxindian to repair it as quickly as possible. (3rd dispatch)</p>

Sun Guangqian, the enemy commander, ordered the soldiers at the front to use bayonets as their only weapon, forming columns and advancing fiercely. The Northeastern Army used machine guns and hand grenades to inflict repeated victories. After the defeat at Qingfengdian, Shi's troops retreated towards the Hutuo River, attempting to flee into Shandong Province. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Eleven Northeastern fighter planes, led by Captain Shen Yongfu, flew to Baoding this morning to attack Shi's troops. (2nd dispatch)</p>

Our army captured many prisoners and seized countless spoils of war. Our First Army Corps has crossed Dingzhou, and Shang Zhen's vanguard has also reached Zhengding. It was previously agreed to send capable troops to pursue in separate directions. At the same time, our Second Army Corps, cavalry, and aircraft will encircle and intercept them from the rear. I have also telegraphed to our Southern Route Army to jointly suppress them, aiming for complete annihilation to pacify the region. From now on, those who spread rumors will have no excuse to deceive, and the doubts of the public can be dispelled. Wang Shuhan bows to Jiang Zi. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beiping telegram reports that the Northeastern Army launched a full-scale offensive on the 30th. By 9:00 PM, Shi's troops had suffered heavy casualties and collapsed completely, fleeing towards the north bank of the Hutuo River. Approximately 15,000 were disarmed, and about 8,000 to 9,000 were killed or wounded. The Northeastern Army dispatched five infantry brigades, two cavalry brigades, and twenty aircraft to pursue.

In particular, the plainclothes troops led by Zhang Xuecheng, who receive no pay, are allowed to loot. Apart from Zhaoxian city being ravaged, everything else along the way is left in ruins. Although Shi's troops abandoned the railway line heavily guarded by troops, their followers still occupy the counties east of the Pinghan Railway, and suppression will take time. The Jin army that arrived in Shijiazhuang is a brigade originally stationed in Jingxing. Shang Zhen does not seem to have arrived yet. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Fang Shao's Bandit Gang Attempts to Invade Yiyang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang telegram: (1) The Communist bandit forces in Xingguo are exhausted and the city can be captured within three days. The remaining bandits south of Donggu and Liantang to Longgang have been completely suppressed. The district commissioners are hurrying to handle the aftermath.

The wives of bandit leaders such as Zou Xiang were captured. The mountain strongholds have been occupied and the surrounding area is being searched. (4) Most of the remaining bandits in Jiangxi are unarmed and have no ability to resist. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the generals at the front to emphasize pacification for these unarmed bandits, to make them realize their errors and return. Not to indiscriminately kill them. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: The various armies have worked hard to advance to the Xingguo and Yudu area.

They are currently coordinating with Tang's brigade to jointly suppress them, hoping to eliminate them as soon as possible. (Central News Agency telegram on the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Appreciating the Anti-Communist Soldiers <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the anti-bandit armies entered Jiangxi, they have repeatedly captured famous cities, and the old nest of the Jiangnan Red bandits has been completely destroyed. The Central Government issued a letter of appreciation to the anti-Communist soldiers as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Communist bandits spread and became a huge disaster, rampaging through Hunan and Jiangxi, their ferocity is especially evident, poisoning the people and trampling on the villages. Wherever the bandits went, houses were reduced to ruins. Even the fury of a tiger released from its cage cannot compare to their ferocity, and only the torrent of a violent flood can adequately describe their harm. This is truly a critical moment for our Party, country, nation, and the survival of our compatriots, and it is something that our comrades cannot ignore.</p>
<p>The Central Government deeply grieves and resents this disaster and has launched a punitive expedition to eliminate these ferocious elements. The most urgent task is to secure the country's safety, rescue the people from the water and fire, eliminate the scourge of humanity, and seek the survival of the nation by eliminating the Communist bandits. For the past two months, thanks to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's planning and decision-making, our generals have been courageous and knowledgeable, repeatedly capturing famous cities and frequently destroying bandit dens. Ningdu is an important town in the bandit area, and Donggu is the old nest of the Red bandits. They have been recovered in succession in less than a month. Hearing the news of victory from afar has made the whole country cheer. Although they are evil creatures, their crimes are full, and they should be exterminated. It is truly thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers that they have achieved quick success. Remembering their hard work, we cannot help but express our gratitude.</p>
<p>However, eliminating evil requires thoroughness, as the ancients said. The resurgence of dead ashes should be guarded against with great caution. The Red bandits use the old tactics of mobile bandits, adopting the cunning schemes of guerrilla warfare, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, gathering and dispersing without a fixed pattern. When facing large armies, they disperse into small units, fleeing and entrenching themselves. When facing small squads, they gather into a whole, suddenly launching an encirclement. The previous spread of the bandit forces and the setbacks of the national army were all due to this. It is painful to speak of this. Now that Donggu has been captured, the long encirclement has been formed, the bandit forces have declined, and annihilation is imminent. Our anti-Communist soldiers at the front must be of one mind and continue their efforts to completely eliminate the evil and eradicate the roots, so that the bandit troubles of many years can be resolved in one fell swoop and the people of the four provinces can all live in peace. This is the achievement of one basket of earth, which should be completed urgently by our soldiers.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the remaining Red elements in Jiangxi have not yet been suppressed, the atrocities against Chinese people in Korea are extremely brutal. All those with blood and breath should feel a sense of common hatred, especially soldiers, whose responsibility is even greater. They should be prepared for battle and guard the country and protect the people, volunteering to defend the country and protect overseas Chinese. However, the rebel Shi Yousan harbors sinister intentions and is taking advantage of internal troubles and external humiliation to launch an uprising, restraining the anti-Communist military campaign and shamelessly supporting foreign aggression. He disregards the suffering of his compatriots and ignores the country's peril, with his conscience completely extinguished and his humanity gone. Our anti-Communist generals and all soldiers are loyal to protecting the people and saving the country and have a long-standing commitment. Hearing of these rebellious actions should fill them with indignation. It is hoped that they will step up their efforts, celebrate an early victory, and use the victorious army that has suppressed the Communists to suppress the rebels and resist foreign aggression, eliminating all rebels, ensuring lasting peace, and securing the country internally and externally with this one effort. This is what I hope all our anti-Communist soldiers will strive for. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">(2) General Mobilization and Universal Relief <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Raising money and donating to urgently relieve the floods. Some may see this as passive work, unrelated to the overall situation. Others may feel that they have donated many times due to years of disasters, and it is too much of a burden to raise funds again now. These views seem plausible but are not. To focus on construction, prevent natural disasters, end conflict, and stop man-made disasters is truly a fundamental strategy and a positive construction. However, since the country is currently experiencing many problems, this has not been possible. Therefore, providing relief when there is a disaster is indeed a positive action. Moreover, thousands of disaster victims are floating and sinking in the floods, looking up to the sky, enduring death while waiting for rescue. To cut back on our unnecessary expenses and rescue those disaster victims waiting to die, a penny of charity, a helping hand, is beneficial to all disaster victims and will not be wasted. Saving even one person is saving a life. Saving ten people is saving ten lives. The facts are clear and visible to all. Rescuing thousands of lives from water and fire, how can we say that this is not a positive action? As for donating multiple times, feeling burdened by it, a single thought of weariness affects the lives of thousands of disaster victims. The impact is immense. Those who harbor this thought should especially consider it carefully. This time, the flooded area covers sixteen provinces, with at least fifty million disaster victims. This is more than double the disaster situation in previous years. Since we have already donated before, we should donate even more this time. Donating money to relieve the disaster is not to show grace, but truly to provide mutual assistance and compassion that all humans should have. People are enduring death waiting for our rescue, while we sit comfortably and arrogantly say that we cannot bear this burden. If we reflect on this, can we feel at peace?</p>
<p>Today, the most active method of relieving the flood disaster is first to mobilize the entire nation. The disaster area is vast, and the number of victims is large. Like a fire burning across stacked firewood, it cannot be extinguished by a cup of water. We must mobilize all people across the nation, those with money donate money, those with strength contribute strength, gather collective strength, and jointly rise up to provide urgent relief. Only then can we achieve success. Second, public and private charitable organizations in various places should cooperate. The reasons for this were already stated in the previous commentary "Urgent Flood Relief." Separating our forces leads to small results. Combining our forces leads to large results. Moreover, assessing all the strength, planning the overall situation, allows the relief to be distributed according to its urgency and allocated evenly. If one place is saved while another is denied, and one place survives while another cannot escape death, then it loses its balance.</p>
<p>Moreover, looking at the history of popular uprisings in our country, most of them were due to famine. Today, after years of turmoil, public morale is shaken, and disasters have increased the crisis. We must seek remedies quickly, or it may still be possible to save the situation. If a chaotic situation is formed, it will become uncontrollable. The people of the country should not be blinded by short-term gains and misled by long-term harms. The reporter respectfully reminds the people of the country again and again.</p>
<p>"Saving people is saving ourselves. Helping people is helping ourselves."</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of losses suffered by overseas Chinese in Korea, Wang Rongbao has requested compensation from the Japanese side, separated into direct and indirect losses, and presented a list. The detailed reports have not yet been compiled. According to other investigations, the direct losses of the Chinese this time amount to approximately 4 million Japanese yen. Since the tragic incident, over 30,000 overseas Chinese have returned to China. Originally, there were 100,000 Chinese in Korea, and one-third have returned to China this time. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting reported at the Foreign Ministry's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 3rd that although the recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai is a normal matter, it is especially noteworthy that the French have this spirit under these circumstances. I hope that France, based on the friendship of the sister republic, will follow this spirit and resolutely proceed with the negotiations on French rights and hand over the concessions and the Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory. I firmly believe that the French government has the possibility of following this spirit. Moreover, with the Communist bandits about to be cleared and the rebel Shi about to be eliminated, negotiations on French rights are gradually becoming unhindered. It can be completely processed by January 1st next year, and unequal treaties can also be cancelled in the shortest possible time based on the Prime Minister's last will. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wang Jiazhen arrived in Beiping this afternoon and talked about the Korean incident, which has already been protested by the Central Government. The Wanbaoshan incident should be resolved locally. The arrival of Japanese police in our country's interior and the forcible renting of land in our country's interior by Korean farmers are all violations of international regulations and judicial actions. China considers this Korean case to be a great national shame, and the Japanese also have unlimited regrets for China. If the Japanese government has no sincerity in resolving it, it is not in the interests of the Japanese. I will go to trial in three or four days and arrive in Harbin before the 15th, waiting for Jiang Zuobin to travel abroad together. I will attend the League of Nations conference in Geneva. After the closing ceremony, I will inspect our country's consulates in various places, and then return home via the United States. The trip will take about four months. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Zones Established with Sampans Used as Guard Posts</p>
<p>Airfield Submerged by More Than Ten Feet</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level has not increased or decreased on the 3rd. Zhang Gong Dike is still solid. The headquarters has established a flood defense command, with Xu Yuanquan and Xia Douyin as supervisors and managers. Zones have been established with sampans used as guard posts and the authority to handle emergency situations. Those who loot during the flood or hoard goods for profit will be punished by military law. He Chengjun and Liu Wendao personally went out to rescue the refugees, saving many lives, who have been sent to Wuchang for resettlement. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Water and Electricity Company has also been submerged by seven feet of water. Only the machine room has waterproof construction and has not yet been submerged.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Wohua, in his report at the weekly memorial service at the Ministry of Interior on the 3rd, stated that China's floods are closely related to imperialist aggression. Because of the impact of economic aggression, there is no power to improve agriculture and prevent floods. The shackles of unequal treaties, such as customs agreements, are followed by the use of force to protect vested rights, and further to achieve the purpose of weakening and annexing others. They also use the warlord divisions in our country to force peasants to privately grow opium, hindering agricultural production, so that warehousing systems cannot be implemented, and disaster preparedness policies have not been carried out. These aggressive targets are aimed at our agriculture. The plan for today is to have compatriots across the country work together, using peaceful non-cooperation to resist aggression and to seek improvements in production for farmers and handicraftsmen, so that there may be some hope for salvation.

However, on the other hand, the stock exchange has not yet reopened, so the second essential step will be the unsealing of the exchange, and the date for this is still undetermined.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Gives Speech on Peaceful Policy <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Specifically Addressed to France</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 2nd - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the completion of the Ravenna Water Plant, saying that Italy is extremely determined to reduce its military equipment on both land and sea, and that peaceful policy is the policy held by all the people of Italy, and it is also the common tendency of the government and party, as well as the wish of the Italian King. Mussolini said, "We are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries. We hope to be friendly with distant countries, and neighboring countries must also value diplomatic relations." The audience cheered loudly at the time, as Mussolini's words referred to France and Yugoslavia. Mussolini also said that our expectation of peace is by no means out of fear of the dangers of war, but because of the urgent need for us to save ourselves from the difficulties within our own country at present, so we also do not want others to interfere.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Churchill (Canada), 2nd - It is now learned that the Lindbergh couple did not go missing, but arrived safely at Moose Factory (at the southern end of Hudson Bay) at 2:00 PM on Saturday as scheduled. They then departed at 10:00 AM on Sunday morning and arrived safely here at 6:50 PM in the evening. Because Moose Factory does not have a telegraph office and the radio on the plane has too little power, they were unable to communicate with the outside world. The Lindberghs are staying here overnight and will continue to Baker Lake, 450 miles to the north, tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Major Changes in National Production Systems</p>
<p>Free Trade Policy Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>Speech by Danish Minister of Commerce</p>
<p>National News Agency, Copenhagen, 2nd - Danish Minister of Commerce Hauge recently delivered a speech stating that Denmark has always advocated free trade, but now there have been major changes in the production systems of various countries. Therefore, there are many domestic industries that are really unable to compete with foreign industries. The traditional free policy of the past is now difficult to maintain, because there is no reason to sacrifice the interests of one's own people to pursue the thorough implementation of free trade. Therefore, Denmark has reached a point where it has no choice but to abandon its inherent policy position. It is said that this is a precedent for Denmark to adopt protective tariffs. Furthermore, Czech shoes are flooding the market in Denmark. It is heard that a tariff bill will be submitted to the parliament soon, and Czech shoes entering the country will be subject to a considerable import tax.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Fujian: To all newspaper offices. We have respectfully read General Commander Chiang's stern telegram. His loyalty and dedication to the country are admired by all. Since the Red bandits brought disaster to the country three years ago, with arson, murder, plunder, and poison spreading across seven provinces, our General Commander braved the summer heat to rescue the people from fire and water. We were rejoicing at the frequent reports of victory and the imminent suppression of the bandits when suddenly the tragic incident involving Korean residents occurred, along with the rebellion in Guangdong province and the revolt of Shi Ni. Examining the inner workings of these events, it is clear that they are the result of collusion between Red bandits, warlords, traitors, and imperialists, all seeking to harm our country and destroy our nation. All who have blood in their veins cannot help but bristle with anger. Considering the differing political views of the past, even if there were disagreements, they could have been discussed at length within the framework of party discipline and national law. But to invite foreign aggression through internal strife is akin to letting a wolf into the house or helping a tiger to devour us. The consequences are too dreadful to contemplate. We hope that our countrymen will deeply reflect on this, uphold the spirit of General Commander Chiang's stern telegram, quell internal strife, achieve unification, and work together with one heart to resist foreign aggression. The provincial government, leading the people of the entire province, vows to be at the forefront. This telegram is urgent. We trust you will understand and observe it. Yang Shuzhuang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, kowtows, 30th day.</p>
<p>Telegram from the People of Guangshan and Other Counties in Henan Province Clarifying Rumors About Ji Hongchang: To all newspaper offices. We, Guangshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, Xixiang, Shangcheng, and Luoshan, are located on the border of Henan Province, controlling the upper reaches of the Huai and Si rivers, dominating Anhui's Bengbu, and bordering Hubei's Macheng to the south, serving as the gateway to the northwest and a key to security. For years, we have suffered from bandits and been plagued by the Red menace. The people live in dire straits, feeling as if they cannot endure another day. Since the 22nd Route Army under General Commander Ji was ordered to be stationed here, the markets have been undisturbed, and the people live in peace. His efforts to suppress bandits are commendable. His sole objective is to eradicate the Red menace. For months, he has been working diligently. Most notably, he attacked the Red bandits in Shangcheng and destroyed the bandit nest in Qiliping, which is widely known. However, Guangshan, Huangchuan, Shangcheng, Gushi, Xixiang, and Luoshan cover hundreds of miles, and the defense line is long. While blocking and suppressing in key areas, the enemy takes advantage of gaps to launch sudden attacks. Due to strategic changes, we sometimes have to prioritize one area over another. Those far away do not understand the difficulties of the situation and make criticisms from the outside. Rumors spread, causing an uproar. Clearly, villains are exploiting this to confuse the public. It should be understood that a small fog cannot obscure the sky, and a small cloud cannot dim the sun. General Commander Ji has taken a nonchalant attitude towards this, which may discourage his officers and soldiers. We, the people, under his protection, have a more accurate understanding of the situation. Therefore, we know it well and speak of it in detail. We do not flatter to please, but aim to do good. We do not embellish words to deceive the world, but uphold our original intention. We speak from our conscience to uphold justice. We respectfully submit this humble report, hoping for your understanding and observation. Representatives of the people of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Xixiang, Shangcheng, and Luoshan Counties: Hengqing, Wu Xingsun, Tong Junfu, Xia Zongyu, Jiang Mingqiao, Li Rengu, Ling Xiangzhou, Xu Huayu, Wen Bingsen, Chen Jian.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Entire County of Wuwei in Anhui Province Begging for Relief: To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper Office, urgently forwarding to all newspaper offices, disaster relief committees, and charitable organizations. Wuwei County, Anhui Province, borders the Yangtze River. The land reclaimed from the lake amounts to millions of mu, but the terrain is extremely low and flat. We rely entirely on the construction of dikes to form weirs, with outer river dams as protection and inner weirs as security. If the river dams collapse, the seven counties of Wuwei, Lujiang, Hefei, and Hanshan will become a watery land. If the weirs are flooded and breached, the entire county of Wuwei will become a vast expanse of water. This year, during the fifth, sixth, and seventh months, it has rained continuously. The river dams are already in a perilous state, and the weirs surrounding hundreds of miles have already been completely flooded and breached. Not only is the harvest of millions of mu of land lost, but also the dry crops on tens of thousands of mu of Jiangtan island land are completely submerged. Our hundreds of thousands of farmers, supporting the old and carrying the young, are camping out in the city and on high hills, with no space left to cry and wail. Although the county government and party headquarters have sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting the exemption of land taxes and the urgent provision of relief, after waiting for days, it is mostly just empty talk. The local reserves of grain are like a drop in the bucket. Most heartbreakingly, those who have been washed away by the flood have become ghosts, and those who have not been washed away do not know how they will survive. In addition to sending representatives to appeal and submitting photographs of the tragic situation, we again telegram the Disaster Relief Committee, Chairman Xu, all committee members, all charitable organizations, and all great philanthropists, hoping for urgent relief and the dispatch of personnel for inspection. If you can bring the dead back to life, our hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will offer incense and pray with all their hearts. Disaster victims' representatives from the entire county of Wuwei, Anhui Province: Lu Zhian and others, kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Yingshang: To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office. Our county controls the Huai and Ying rivers. A month ago, there was heavy rain for ten days, and the Huai and Ying rivers overflowed. Our association was directly affected, and the flood was particularly severe. Tens of thousands of houses were flooded and collapsed. The number of people and livestock drowned and swept away is countless. The dead are gone, and the living are in dire need of rescue. In addition to our association providing relief, we ask your newspaper to widely publicize this to expand relief efforts. The Yingshang County Charity Association kowtows in winter.</p>

<p>Chen Bulei Speaks on Future Work in Education</p>
<p>Shao Yuan Chong Speaks on the Center of Psychological Construction</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang held its 123rd Memorial Week this morning. Over six hundred people attended, including Chen Lifu, Ding Weifen, Chen Bulei, Zhang Daofan, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, Zhou Qigang, and staff and guests. Chaired by Ding Weifen, Chen Bulei reported that the basic work for the future lies in education. He stated that to popularize education, it is necessary to increase the number of schools, increase education funding, and cultivate necessary teachers. To ensure that students have a future, it is necessary to improve school curriculum and facilities and raise standards. At the same time, it is also necessary to develop productive industries to increase the absorption of many graduates. Even in times of great difficulty, the country should find ways to solve these practical problems. In addition, there is a more important and fundamental problem, which is to understand the purpose, meaning, and function of education. The purpose of education is stated in a comprehensive sentence in the political report resolution of the Third National Congress: "To enable individuals to contribute their sound abilities to the overall purpose of social survival." The major problem with education today seems to be that everyone has forgotten this fundamental point. Therefore, (1) parents do not understand why they should send their children to school and how to cultivate their children into useful members of the family and the country; (2) those who run education do not understand why they should run education or ignore the purpose of education, which is to create sound citizens; (3) those who receive education do not understand why they should receive education and what they are preparing to do after receiving education. Currently, there are people who meticulously analyze the specialized theories, systems, and methods of education, but the question of the purpose of education and the relationship between education and the nation is often neglected by experts. This is a serious problem that deserves deep attention. I hope that all comrades dedicated to the education field will pay attention to the fundamental problems of education, truly understand the relationship between education and the nation, earnestly develop the educational purpose of the Republic of China, and use the educated person's thinking as the guide for the entire course of study and as the inescapable responsibility of those engaged in education. May our efforts make the education field feel less lonely, and may those who have not yet realized the seriousness of this problem also spend some time considering it. If the direction of education is correct, the effectiveness of education will naturally be evident, and society will naturally enthusiastically support education. In this way, we can have more educational institutions and receive more good results, and we can ask the general public to bear the education tax. We can complete the work of nation-building through the construction of education.</p>
<p>National Government: The National Government held its Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. Yu Youren, Ma Fuxiang, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Li Shuhua, Ru Yuli, He Yaozu, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Gao Weiyue, and other government officials, totaling over two hundred people, attended. After Director Yu Youren led the attendees in paying respects, Shao Yuanchong gave a speech, stating that the center of psychological construction is to seek knowledge. He said that knowledge is not only a necessary condition for the progress of the revolution, but also essential for being a person. Only with knowledge can one solve all problems. Many disputes in the country in the past, and the current continuing disputes, are due to the failure of people's psychological construction. Young people do not regard studying as their sole responsibility and instead complain that society cannot accommodate them. Military personnel, such as Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang in the past and Shi Yousan now, all overestimate their abilities and blindly rebel, falling into the same trap. This is not only harmful to society and the country, but also leads to their own failure. A person should not say, "This matter cannot be done without me." Instead, others should say, "This matter cannot be done without him." This is true greatness and success. Whether we are engaged in research, academics, agriculture, commerce, industry, politics, or other businesses, if everyone fulfills their duties, society will surely progress. However, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to make fulfilling one's duties the basic condition. If everyone can fulfill their duties, then all chaos will naturally not arise.</p>

<p>The Central Government Has Ordered Han to Handle It</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Pinghan battle has become fierce. The Northeast Army and the Chuan Army are attacking Shi's troops from the north and south. There are also reports that the Shanxi Army under Shang Zhen will send troops to Shijiazhuang. Shi's troops are surrounded on three sides and have no way to advance or retreat. In the future, they will retreat to Shandong. According to Jiang Bocheng's talk on the 31st, Shi's 13th Route Army officers and soldiers are dedicated to the party and the country. They were coerced by Shi to participate in the war, which is very pitiful. Chairman Han has always been trusted by Shi's troops. If Shi's troops break away and return, the Central Government will treat them equally and order Chairman Han to be responsible for receiving and resettling them. Ma Hongkui, Commander of the 15th Route Army, came to Jinan from Tai'an on the 31st to negotiate defense matters. He returned to his defense area at 8:15 PM that night. According to Ma's interview with reporters, the Central Government has ordered that if Shi's troops flee south to Shandong, Chairman Han will be responsible for receiving them. However, there are two brigades of the Northeast Army with over 7,000 soldiers intercepting them in the Hejian and Cangzhou area. It is still uncertain whether Shi's troops can come south. Preparations have been made here. Also, Cao Fulin, Commander of the 29th Division, came to Jinan from Yucheng on the Taishan armored train at 4:00 PM on Sunday. According to his talk, the border between Hebei and Shandong is calm as usual. Jiang Bocheng, Ma Hongkui, and others all received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang on the 1st, reporting that the Northeast Army is besieging Shi Yousan's troops on three sides. Shi's troops are collapsing and fleeing towards Dingzhou and Anguo. They are no longer an army and can be resolved soon. (August 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Progress of the Anti-Shi Military Campaign <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Qian Zongze Talks About the Transportation Situation of the Anti-Shi Army</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: News from the Garrison Department: The Northeast Army is the main force in the anti-Shi military campaign. The Southern Route Group Army is taking a defensive and intercepting posture. After Shi's troops retreated north, the Northeast Army launched a general attack on the 27th of last month, suffering heavy losses. The Southern Route Group Army is also advancing and pursuing fiercely. The Garrison Department received a telegram from Xinxiang on the 31st: "Our vanguard, the Second Army Group, has arrived in Shijiazhuang. Commander-in-Chief Liu and Commander Gu have arrived in Handan to direct the advance north. The divisions of our Third Army Group are following the Second Army Group and advancing north, taking a flanking posture. Commander-in-Chief Wang arrived in Xinxiang at noon on the 30th. After personally instructing the two division commanders, Zeng and Chen, he took the night train to Handan to meet with Liu and Gu to discuss everything. Then, he went to the Daokou-Qinghua Railway line to inspect and direct the encirclement. Our First Army Group, under Commander-in-Chief Liu, also ordered its divisions to cross the river and advance east from southern Shanxi to encircle and suppress Shi's troops after meeting with Liu Zhi in Xinxiang last month. Judging from the current situation, the rebel soldiers of Shi's troops in the south are already surrounded on three sides by our Southern Route Army. The central advancing troops have already occupied Shi's old nest in Shijiazhuang, crossed Shunde, and reached Shijiazhuang. The northern route is being met by Yu Xuezhong's troops. The Shanxi Army will send troops east under Shang Zhen, and the Shandong Army has already sent troops to guard the northwest of Shandong under Han Fuqu. Shi's troops are now in an encirclement on all sides. The dissipation of the northern turmoil is not far off."</p>
<p>After Qian Zongze was appointed as the commander of the four-route transportation of the Tianjin-Lanzhou and Pinghan Railways, he established a headquarters in Zhengzhou and set up offices in seven locations: Pukou, Wuhan, Bianliang, Zhengzhou, Zhangde, Xinxiang, and Xuzhou. They were all established on the 24th of last month. Qian came to Xuzhou on the morning of the 31st due to the Lanzhou-Haizhou Railway defense line to discuss everything with Zhang Jinde, the chief staff officer of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Garrison Headquarters. Zhang ordered the Third Regiment of the Finance Department Special Task Force to be dispatched for defense. Qian returned to Zhengzhou that night. According to Qian's words in Xuzhou, the anti-Shi military campaign is progressing smoothly. The front of the Southern Route Group Army has arrived in Shijiazhuang, and the rear military transportation is also smooth. The directors of the offices have also been appointed. Xu Yaogeng in Kaifeng, You Fei in Zhengzhou, Wang Gengyu in Zhangde, Lü Yunsun in Xinxiang, Zuo Maotang in Xuzhou, and the railway bureau recommended appointments for Pukou and Wuhan. A total of forty-five trains on the Tianjin-Lanzhou and Pinghan Railways are dedicated to military transportation for convenience. It is expected that the military campaign will be resolved soon, and the military transportation can also be concluded. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Investigation of the Korean Incident (Continued) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The True Face of the Japanese Side: Japan's plan for Korea is to adopt a policy of gradual immigration, moving Korean people to the Northeast to live with Chinese people, making the Northeast a semi-colonial area. They want to free up a piece of land in Korea and move the surplus Japanese population there. Unexpectedly, Chinese people have not known how to advance or retreat in recent years and have continued to immigrate, filling the positions vacated by the Korean people. Before the Japanese people can move in, the Chinese people have already taken their place, sharing some profits each year and sending them back to China. This is especially disliked by the masters. Therefore, Japanese newspapers, such as the Keijo Nippo, the organ of the Government-General of Korea, repeatedly publish news about the number of Chinese people entering Korea and affecting the livelihood of Korean people. At the same time, the Korean newspapers, such as the Korean Ilbo and the Chosun Ilbo, promote the idea that hundreds of thousands of Chinese people reside in Korea, sharing 40 to 50 million in profits each year and sending them back to China. This is all the blood and sweat of the Korean people, which is being scraped away by the Chinese people. They should quickly find ways to prevent this. Therefore, Korean people have gradually become hostile to Chinese people. The Government-General of Korea has used labor permits to restrict the entry of Chinese people. When Chinese people enter Korea, they are neither prevented nor rejected. Those who want to work or set up businesses must obtain a certificate. Each certificate is only valid for one year. Whether they will be allowed to obtain another certificate after the expiration date is up to the government to consider. Therefore, the lives of Chinese people are even more difficult. Each time a certificate is presented, it is delayed and not issued until the Chinese people cannot survive and are forced to return to their country. The Seoul-Incheon Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly appealed for this passive anti-Chinese method and requested the Japanese side to clearly order the prohibition of Chinese people from entering Korea to avoid the侨胞 futile travel back and forth. The Japanese government seems to be concerned about the great powers and is unwilling to issue such an order. In the early spring of this year, many Chinese people had already arrived in Seoul and Incheon. Due to the restrictions of the Japanese authorities, they were trapped for many days and had no choice but to return to their country. Those who did not come saw the Japanese side's rejection and stopped. On the Japanese side, they are also unwilling to use public words to offend the world. After hesitating repeatedly, they used the Wanpaoshan incident to fabricate rumors of Korean people being harmed and to make the ignorant and uninformed Korean people engage in indirect anti-Chinese behavior. When the Wanpaoshan incident occurred, the Japanese side immediately designated the Keijo Nippo as a monthly chronicle of evil propaganda, publishing news every day about Chinese people oppressing Korean farmers and expelling Korean people from the Northeast provinces. The Korean people, unaware, gnashed their teeth and clenched their fists at the Chinese people, deliberately looking for trouble. Half a month ago, there were several incidents of conflict between Chinese and Korean people every day. On July 1st, Changchun farmers dug up the ditch. The Japanese side believed that the opportunity had arrived and reported to the Japanese Consulate in Changchun that Chinese farmers and police had surrounded Korean farmers and beaten several people to death. The Chosun Ilbo published an extra edition based on this information. Although the newspaper published a report by Special Commissioner Kim Tatsuo, saying that Kim was killed by Changchun farmers, in fact, Kim never reported it and was innocently killed. The anger of the Korean people, which had been accumulating for a long time, was vented in one day. However, at first, they did not dare to beat people, only throwing stones and smashing windows. Later, seeing that the Japanese police not only did not stop them, but also helped them, they became bolder and started to beat people. The original intention of the Japanese side was to make the Korean people riot and beat the Chinese people, creating panic and making the Chinese people flee in fear. They did not know that what was released by me would not listen to my orders when recovered. The Korean people became excited about beating and killing, and it became their pleasure to kill and set fire. The tragedy in Pyongyang was caused by this reason. Although Japan deliberately showed calmness afterward, it was because the Korean people's riot had gradually exceeded its expected range. It was also afraid that they would unite and act against Japan, so it tried its best to suppress them. Later, the Japanese police in various places armed themselves and came out to protect them in earnest. It should be known that this was not a sincere protection of the Chinese people, but entirely for their own sake. Although their plan has fortunately succeeded, they feel guilty in their hearts and are afraid that it will be difficult to explain to China and to the great powers. Therefore, they are trying their best to comfort the wounded and dead and to cover up their actions. However, everyone knows Sima Zhao's intentions.</p>
<p>The True Heart of the Korean People: The Korean people have no independent opinions. Those over middle age express goodwill towards Chinese people. Based on historical relations, they call Chinese people "Taeilguk Saram" (i.e., people of a great country) and have always been friendly. Those under middle age have been influenced by Japanese education and look down on Chinese people, calling Chinese people "Chungguk Saram" or "Jina Saram," which is still respectful. Otherwise, they directly call them "long necks" (meaning "Please Please Thing" in Japanese, which comes from the Chinese people saying "Please Please" when being polite). Children especially like to intercept Chinese people on the street and call them that to their faces. Chinese people are greedy for the easy profits in the area, so even if they are humiliated, they cannot bear to leave. Sometimes Korean people gather in restaurants, order wine and food, and after eating and drinking their fill, they push and refuse to pay the owner. Even if they are arrested and detained by the Japanese police station, the Chinese merchants have already suffered losses. However, this is only a common occurrence and has no major relationship with this tragedy. The greatest cause of this incident is the increasing number of Chinese people entering Korea. The labor is cheap and hardworking. The daily wage of Korean workers is one yuan, while the daily wage of Chinese workers is only five jiao. In terms of work, such as loading and unloading cars at the dock, six Chinese workers can load and unload one car per day. If Korean workers are used instead, even eight people cannot complete the job in one day. Therefore, Chinese workers are welcomed by employers. Even Korean business owners hire Chinese workers. In addition, Korean people are lazy by nature. They often take breaks from work. After working for a few days and earning a small amount of money, they give up and play for a few days, waiting until they have spent all their money before continuing to work. Such laziness is naturally not welcomed. Therefore, the number of Chinese workers in Korea is increasing day by day. Stevedores can earn two yuan per day. Those with expertise, such as carpenters and tilers, can earn twice as much. Korean people see us as cheap, but we Chinese see the profit as several times higher than in our country. Korean people are clumsy and have simple skills. There are very few carpenters and tilers. The work they do is slow and clumsy, far inferior to our workers. Therefore, our carpenters and tilers also have considerable influence in Korea. The status of Chinese workers is increasing day by day, and they are gradually being valued. At the same time, the number of Korean people who are being displaced and unemployed is also increasing day by day. They are jealous and resentful of Chinese people and are thinking of taking the opportunity to vent their anger. The Japanese are also stirring up trouble and inciting them, causing the Korean people under middle age to want to strike a blow and enjoy themselves. Most of those who participated in the atrocities on the day of the incident were workers and students. Korean people over the age of forty did not approve of this. When they encountered Chinese people fleeing, they would hide them or change their clothes and send them out of the border. Therefore, many Chinese people were able to escape thanks to them. After the great massacre in Pyongyang, various groups organized by the general public expressed great sympathy for the Chinese people, sending money and food to comfort the wounded and dead dozens or hundreds of times. When they met Chinese people, they would apologize. The peace in various places is not due to the maintenance of the Japanese side, but entirely due to the buffer effect of these groups.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Ever-Increasing Water Levels in the Canal <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The two factions of upholding and opening the Cheluo Dam are in fierce dispute.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province heads to Gaobao to inspect.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou reports that the water level in the canal has been rising dramatically in recent days. From July 30th to August 1st, the Shao Bo area under the jurisdiction of Gaobao and Jiangdu counties has seen a continuous rise in water levels.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Residents along the canal are in a state of panic and confusion. Yesterday morning (July 31st), our reporter chartered a boat from Yangzhou northward (because steamships and automobiles had long since stopped running). As the boat passed Wantou, ten li from Yangzhou, the waterline was gradually approaching the shore. Upon reaching Shao Bo, the distance between the shore and the water was only about one foot. Many sandbags had been placed on the east bank. Entering the Gaoyou County boundary, the distance between the water and the shore became even closer. Arriving at Cheluo in You at 5 PM, there were many people on the shore. We disembarked and asked about the water level. According to them, on the 29th, it was one zhang, seven chi, and four cun. On the 30th, it rose sharply by four cun. Today (the 31st), it has risen another five fen. Judging by the situation, it is feared that it will continue to rise. We further investigated the number of people on the shore. Between Cheluo and Gaoyou County, a distance of twenty li, there were about three or four thousand people. Besides one-third being from Gaoyou, the rest had dialects from the lower river counties, such as Xinghua, Dongtai, and Yancheng. Further inquiries revealed that the county magistrates, members of the county party headquarters, heads of various bureaus, and representatives of various public organizations from the above counties were all gathered there, taking turns supervising the laborers to protect the dike and strictly guarding the Cheluo Dam, fearing that the people of Gaoyou would secretly open it and cause the lower river to be flooded. Many reed mat sheds were built along the bank, and open-air stalls selling sesame cakes and steamed buns filled the dike. The two factions of upholding and opening the dam were like warring states, facing each other in a tense standoff. Wang Long, the magistrate of Gaoyou County, Li Zhongqiang, the director of the engineering office, and officials and gentry from the lower river counties were consulting back and forth, planning to open half of the Cheluo Dam, seeking only to keep the water level along the canal even with the shore. However, the people of Xinghua and other counties swore they would never allow it. The magistrate of Xinghua County was particularly vehement in the dispute. Wu Tongju, the director of the canal engineering office, was also in Gaoyou. Mao Yisheng, the director of the water conservancy bureau, went to Bao on the 30th, as the two hundred or so li along the canal from Baoying to Shaobo Town in Jiangdu were the most dangerous. They were divided into sections: Baoying, Sishui, Yong'an, Gaoyou, and Jiangdu. Each section, known as one of the five downstream sections, had a section chief and several staff members. Every li had a defense work shed manned by five people, known as shed guards. A golden yellow flag was erected on each shed, with black characters saying "Defense Work Section No. X Shed". The reason why the flag was golden yellow was because golden yellow is similar to earth color, implying that earth can overcome water. Near each shed, there were piles of earth and reeds of varying heights. If the dike were to crack, they would be used for emergency repairs. If the crack was large, while making emergency repairs, the shed guards would rush to report to other sheds to the north and south, so that they could concentrate on the cracked area and work together to protect it. The preparations were said to be very thorough. Regarding the issue of upholding or opening the dam, Commissioner Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs was expected to arrive from Zhenjiang the day after tomorrow (August 2nd) to first inspect the Jiang'an bank in Guazhou, and then go to You to investigate the situation, so as to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision on whether to open or uphold the dam. Our reporter originally intended to go to Baoying again, but because the water level upstream was even higher and the boat could not move forward, we returned to Yangzhou this morning (August 1st). After arriving in Yangzhou, we received a long-distance call from Gaoyou that the water level at Yuma Wharf had reached one zhang and eight chi. The Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent's Office telegraphed the provincial government's Director Li Mingyangshi: "Opening the dam would cause significant losses. The province has decided to focus on protecting the assigned personnel, namely, Wu Tongju, Director of the Canal Engineering Office, and Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau. Please immediately instruct your subordinate troops to cooperate and maintain it. Deeply grateful." After Superintendent Zhang approved the telegram, he immediately telegraphed Chief Commander Liang in Qingjiang and the brigade commander stationed in Yangzhou to comply and provide assistance. In addition, along the road from Yangzhou to Taixian, the three bridges of Dong, Shi, and Liao, which we passed, were extremely long, requiring more than 300,000 yuan for construction. In the past two days, the Dong and Shi bridges had been completely washed away by the flood. The longest Liao Bridge (i.e., Wanfu Bridge) is now tilting southward and is impassable. It is expected to collapse within half a day. The long-distance bus routes between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou and Zhongjiang have been damaged by the rain and have been impassable for a week. The long-distance telephone line across the river between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang has also been cut off by the river tide. If the dikes along the canal unfortunately collapse again, the lives and property of dozens of counties will suffer even greater losses. (August 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Heartbreaking and Tragic Flooding in Jiangpu <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing reports that Jiangpu, facing the Yangtze River and bordering Anhui Province, has been plagued by continuous rain for the past month, causing mountain torrents to erupt. Most of the polder fields in the northern part of the area have been breached, and countless people have been swept away. What's worse, on the 23rd and 24th of last month, heavy rain poured down, day and night, and the Jiaohong River from the eight hundred li Huangshan Mountains in northern Anhui overflowed and flowed straight down. All the polder dikes and embankments were washed away. Even flatland towns such as Chahe, Dongge, Yongning, and Tangquan were several zhang deep in water. As a result, more than ten li of the Jinpu Railway foundation was washed away, and the train was stopped for about four or five days. The area was a vast expanse of water, with no boundaries. People, livestock, and belongings were all swept away. Cries shook the ground, and the scene was too tragic to bear. The flood victims climbing the treetops were rescued by emergency relief, while no fewer than several thousand people, supporting the old and carrying the young, moved to the mountains to take refuge, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, and crying for food. Those who were unable to escape the raging flood and drowned were also everywhere. The scale of this catastrophe is unprecedented. Currently, local gentry Ye Chuliang (Director of the World Red Swastika Society) and local enthusiasts Gu Jinbo, Lin Chunting, Wu Heting, Lou Xiaokuan, Xu Rangsan, Gu Laixi, etc., concerned about the severity of the disaster, specially invited the county relief branch, the Chamber of Commerce, the relief hospital, the Red Cross, and other organizations to organize the Jiangpu Flood Emergency Relief Association. They temporarily raised more than a thousand yuan in silver and two hundred bags of flour (issued by the Xiaguan Red Swastika Society) to carry out emergency relief. They also led a steamboat and went to the disaster area to provide relief. They have been working day and night, extremely busy. No fewer than several hundred people in the border area of Liuhe (Yueliang, Shuangcheng, and other polders), who were connected to Pu and received the same relief, were able to save their lives. In addition to actively carrying out relief work, the association has also sent Xu Rangsan, Gu Laixi, etc., to various government offices and charitable organizations in the province and Shanghai to appeal, report on the disaster, and request emergency assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Wuhu Quick Dispatch <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The various circles' flood relief association held a meeting at the county government yesterday. To expand the fundraising efforts, all leaders of various organizations and chairmen of various trade associations were made members. Zhao, the chief of public security bureau, Magistrate Yu, and Lu, the manager of the Shanghai Bank, and other fifteen people were mutually elected as executive members. The provincial government has already sent a telegram, first allocating 1,000 yuan, instructing proper implementation of urgent relief, and notifying various entertainment venues to jointly organize a flood relief entertainment meeting after the flood recedes. Currently, in addition to the association, various charitable organizations and private individuals have already started to collect donations, distribute rice tickets and money tickets, and provide pot crust porridge, etc. The price of rice has risen sharply by several yuan in the past two days, with inferior rice already selling for 13 yuan per dan. The party headquarters has requested the public security bureau to quickly stop it to reassure the people.</p>
<p>In recent days, no fewer than ten thousand disaster-stricken people from neighboring counties and villages have come to Wuhu to flee the famine, and they are everywhere. For the sake of local security, the military and police authorities have implemented a curfew every night from 11:00 PM, setting up posts to check pedestrians, and dispatching water patrols to patrol the streets. Last night, the power company, the telephone bureau, and the telegraph bureau all sent troops to guard the area, which was extremely tight. The provincial government has also ordered the provincial shipping office to send armed patrol boats to Wuhu to patrol the river and maintain local security.</p>
<p>Yuxi, a place in Hexian County, twenty li from Wuhu, is a necessary area for rice boats from the province to come and go, and commerce is very prosperous. However, the night before, fifty or sixty bandits suddenly arrived, carrying weapons, and rushed to the town, intending to rob the self-defense group of their guns. The enclosure, knowing it was outnumbered, had already taken their weapons and fled in advance. The bandits then went from house to house robbing, and only left fully loaded after several hours. More than a hundred stores, such as Ruhe Shengxiang and Tonghechun, were robbed, with losses of about tens of thousands of taels of silver.</p>
<p>Wanzhi and Xih River, two major towns in Wuhu, were already heavily flooded, but the night before, Jiaolong river suddenly occurred, and the water rose more than a zhang high, rushing straight in. More than fifty stores in Xi River were destroyed, and more than a hundred people died.</p>
<p>At Lubin Port and Pangxie Creek in Wuhu, it was previously discovered that bandits had colluded with hundreds of refugees to rob passing rice boats and travelers, and planned to encircle and rob the Lubin Port Defense Corps of their guns. The group commander came to Wuhu for help, and the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division immediately sent a company of soldiers on a special ship. They scattered the bandits, captured eight bandits, and seized a wheat boat that had been robbed. They have already been sent to Wuhu for interrogation. (August 2nd)</p>

<p>Woman willingly commits adultery with her father, who accuses her of abduction. Lu Hanwen, a farmer from the 33rd map of Dongxiang in the county, had an affair with Yun Gu, the eldest daughter of Chen Musen from the same map. He divorced his wife and eloped with the woman on March 28th of the 18th year to live in Shanghai. Although Chen sued the county at that time, he was never found because his address was unknown. Now, Hanwen thought that things had passed and the affair had cooled down and would be understood. He returned with the woman to his hometown on the 23rd of last month to recognize his maternal uncle. Unexpectedly, Musen was ashamed and indignant when he saw this situation, and immediately twisted the man and woman together to the county government, requesting the law to investigate the matter. The Eastern Office's judge, Tong, opened the court for trial. According to the confession, both Yun Gu and the other said that they had cohabited voluntarily, and the Chen family had come to the face-to-face to admit it. At the same time, Yun Gu also confessed that she was willing to run away with Hanwen. Her father had been to her home in Shanghai for meals and money. This time, however, it was because she had listened to others, intending to sell her elsewhere, etc. However, Judge Tong believes that although the matter is voluntary, the previous and subsequent procedures have not been legally handled. Therefore, in addition to putting Yun Gu on bail, he ordered her to continue to verify and take the matter into his hands.</p>

<p>A tofu merchant's funeral was stolen of a large sum of money. According to local customs, when an elderly person dies, relatives and friends do not wear mourning clothes on the day of the funeral. Also, when returning to the house (i.e., returning home), they must enter through a red and green door. They should wear silk clothes and red skirts, and wear gold, silver, and jewelry on their heads to show the breadth of the scene. Zhu Ronggeng, the owner of a tofu shop at No. 14 Qingguoxiang, had saved some money in his life. He died of illness in late last month, and yesterday was the day of his funeral. Several relatives and friends packed red skirts, silk clothes, beads, gold, silver, jewelry, etc., in a large leather bag, intending to bring them to the cemetery for use when returning home. Unexpectedly, when the coffin was being carried out, it was stolen by a thief taking advantage of the chaos. In addition to the gold jewelry and clothes, there was also a pearl flower. The total loss was estimated at about 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Mulberry fields are flooded, causing autumn silkworms to die. Since the beginning of summer, the county has been experiencing continuous rain and rising river water. The dikes in the four villages have collapsed one after another, creating an irredeemable ocean. As a result, many mulberry fields have been flooded. Therefore, the autumn silkworm crop will inevitably be greatly reduced. It is reported that the various seed production fields have produced a total of 1.4 million sheets of autumn silkworm eggs. Currently, only 400,000 sheets have been sold. Qingcheng City, Qianzhou, Yuqi, Beiqifang, and other places have all ordered the Tiger Brand seeds from the Dayou Seed Production Field, totaling 360,000 sheets. However, the breeders are currently aware that the mulberry trees are soaked in water, and the mulberry leaves are withered and yellow. Feeding the silkworms with them would be unsuitable. Therefore, they have no intention of raising them and have been returning them to the seed production field.</p>

<p>Opening the Cheluo Dam was unsuccessful. Because of the rising river water, various legal groups in the county feared that there would be a danger of dike breaks, so they sent a telegram to the provincial government to open the dam.

After receiving the telegram, the county authorities sent police officers from the Public Security Bureau and stationed troops in the mail to open the Cheluo Dam. At that time, there were about 5,000 farmers from Xinghua, Taixing, Yancheng, Dong, and the lower river counties who were sleeping on the dam to protect it. Seeing that they wanted to open the dam, the sound of crying shook the sky for a while, and the scene was too tragic to bear.

<p>Supervisors illegally arrested. Wang Zongwen and Wen Hongxiang, supervisors of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, led the police to the South Lake the other day. Shi Guixiang, Yang Jinsheng, and Qiu Jingshui jumped from the silk net boat to the ferry boat and were ordered to cross to Yanyu Tower. They were immediately accused of improper behavior, preventing the cable from being unanchored, and coercing Guixiang and the other three, including the boat woman Jinbao, to follow them ashore. Arrested to the bureau, now Guixiang and others are closely related to Wang and Wen, who are close to illegal arrest, and violate the law and misunderstand the criminal law. Moreover, the members and other officials deal with illegal cases and act legally. The Yuan contacted and urgently asked the county government to elect members of the board, or the police officers were committed to court for punishment for breaking the law.</p>
<p>A telegram was sent to announce the expenditures of the district office. The expenses of the Jiaxing District Office were supplemented in the 19th year with a total of 5 jiao per shi and per tael from the grain tax. At that time, county residents Jiang Shitan and Sheng Yuan once telegraphed to exempt the tax. The Finance Department approved the tax for one year in the 19th year. When the tax period expired, it was busy collecting the tax in the 20th year. The county has compiled a summary of the number of surcharges collected, reconciled the revenue and expenditure, and inquired whether to continue to collect the tax, open meetings, and then submit it for approval. The department ordered the county to comply with the case. The county government convened a meeting of a small number of legal representatives a month ago to submit a request to continue to collect the tax because Sheng Yuan and other ten people sent separate telegrams, instructing the county to stop the surcharge, and at the same time, publicly announce the number of collections collected in the 19th year. After the Finance Department received the telegram, it ordered the county government and the Finance Bureau to investigate the original case, review it, and report it for decision.</p>

The Director of Finance, Zhou, had just arrived at Baique Village when he was surrounded by the local villagers, who smashed his sedan chair. Also, at around 10 a.m. on the same morning, more than 300 farmers from the 24th and 25th villages at the border of Qingdongmen and Fengshengmen gathered, each carrying farm tools, and swarmed to the Wuxing County Auditorium. The county magistrate was out inspecting the disaster outside the South Gate and had not yet returned. The county section chief came out to meet with Shao Hetai, the village head of the two villages, and advised the farmers to return to their villages and attend to their farms.

Before these villagers had dispersed, hundreds of farmers from Jifang Village outside the North Gate, each carrying hoes and shovels, marched in, ringing gongs. The outcome remains unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Municipal Government Suspends Appropriations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<h3 id="e94">Reasons for the County Education Subsidy <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>If Respect is Given to the Resolutions of the Provincial and Municipal Division of Governance Rights Conference</p>
<p>The Various Handover Subsidy Fees Can Still be Appropriated as Usual</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai County Party Department's discussion of the Shanghai Municipal Government violating the agreement and owing Shanghai County education fees, a reporter from the East China News Agency went to the Municipal Government to inquire about everything. According to an important official, the Municipal Government previously stopped allocating subsidies to Shanghai and Baoshan counties due to disputes over the division of funds between the province and the city. Later, the Jiangsu Provincial Government repeatedly submitted requests from Shanghai and Baoshan counties to resolve the issue quickly, so it sent personnel to jointly liquidate with the Municipal Government. In addition, with the relocation of the Shanghai County government urgently underway, there was a great need for funds, and a request was made to the Municipal Government to first allocate funds starting from April of this year to maintain essential needs. In addition to sending personnel to jointly liquidate, the Municipal Government replied that it would approve the request and issue subsidies to Shanghai and Baoshan counties uniformly starting from May of this year. As for the suspension of the Shanghai County education subsidy, it is actually a separate issue. Before the division of governance rights between the province and the city, the Shanghai County Education Bureau took more than 38,000 yuan of municipal rental income, of which a portion was used as the administrative expenses of the Education Bureau, and the rest was used to handle the funding of Minhang Rural Middle School and Rural Normal School. The intention was to prepare a countermeasure after the transfer of governance rights, completely disregarding the facts of past years and the original fixed cases, and vaguely obtained approval from the former Central University. The means were particularly lacking in transparency. At the time of the handover, the expenditure statement submitted also listed 27,463 yuan of newly collected popular education mu tax and 1,122 yuan of municipal and rural subsidy committee salaries in the income item, in order to create the impression that the funds managed by this city were a superficial income exceeding expenditure, and the city was able to vaguely obtain an annual subsidy of 12,000 yuan in accordance with Article 5 of the Provincial and Municipal Division of Governance Rights Resolution. All educational institutions in Shanghai County that are located in the area that Shanghai Special Municipality should immediately take over should be transferred to the Special Municipality by the county, and the county's educational funds within the municipal and rural areas that should be transferred should be transferred to the Special Municipality. However, the County Education Bureau did not follow the regulations for uniform transfer, such as public school gardens, public science laboratories, Yu Garden Shangwen Road, Wu Garden Road, Zao Kui Street, Chuanxin Street, Yinggong Temple Road, Penglai Road, near the Pan Tang and other places, the annual income of which is 18,000 yuan, all belong to the educational assets in this area. Except for the current school garden and science laboratory, which have been transferred after several negotiations, all the equipment in the laboratory has been moved away. The Municipal Education Bureau estimated the value and approved it to be deducted from the County Education Fund. As for the remaining items, negotiations have been repeatedly carried out without any transfer. In order to implement the method of recovering and taking over, the Municipal Government has temporarily suspended the allocation of the County Education Fund, and has also sent a consultation to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to temporarily order corrections and supplementary payment. The Municipal Government's attitude is that if the County Education Bureau can respect the resolutions of the Provincial and Municipal Division of Governance Rights Conference and transfer the items that should be transferred first, then the education subsidy fee can also be allocated as usual.

<p>According to the previous regulations of the Cup Tournament Organizing Committee, the results of each group match must be submitted no later than Monday morning of the week following the match. However, the results of the Meilu vs. Youyou and Meilu vs. Chenguang matches have not yet been reported, which is a pity. It is heard that the Organizing Committee is now formulating new measures to improve the flow of information, and is notifying each team, saying, in the future, each team should be responsible for submitting the results of each group match to the committee secretary, Mr. Lu Shiwu (address: 323 Lane 4, Defuli, Madu, Shanghai Race Club, telephone 30933) on the afternoon of the match at 8:00 pm, so that they can be compiled and sent to various newspapers for publication, so that people can be the first to know. I hope that each team will not misunderstand.</p>

<p>丨Two World Records Broken丨</p>
<p>Lincoln, July 4th - The 56th All-American Track and Field Championships were held on the afternoon of July 4th in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, amidst dim light and damp air. Track and field athletes from various states all fought bravely and appeared in full regalia. World records and national achievements emerged and were revealed one after another. The excellence of the results caused countless spectators to marvel. The competition was once stopped due to heavy rain, but the air turned dry in the evening. The entire field was illuminated by thousands of lights, shining as brightly as day, and the competition was able to continue and end perfectly. The Los Angeles Athletic Club won the championship with 41 points, and the New York Athletic Club came in second with 35 points. Here are excerpts of the most outstanding achievements for reference:</p>
<p>100 Yards - Frank Wykoff, a student of Gretel, is an invincible sprinter. He has crossed both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and no one has ever been able to compete with him shoulder to shoulder. In the competition, he achieved 9.5 seconds in both the preliminary and final rounds, equaling the world record. In the final, he defeated Elmer Toppino of New Orleans. Toppino also achieved 9.5 seconds in the preliminary round and surpassed Eddie Tolan's previous record held in Michigan by five feet. Of the three timers, two recorded Wykoff's time as 9.5 seconds, while one recorded 9.3 seconds. If the time of the last person is valid, it would be a record never before seen by mankind.</p>
<p>220 Yards - Tolan of Michigan, unsuccessful in the 100 yards, vented his anger in the 220 yards, achieving a time of 21 seconds on the curved track, breaking the old record of 21.3 seconds. He and Metcalf ran side by side, but he put in the most effort and won by an inch. However, many observers believed that he seemed to have lost to a strong opponent.</p>
<p>Half Mile - Eddie Jenne, who set a record last year with 1 minute 53.4 seconds, broke his own record again this year, achieving a result of 1 minute 52.6 seconds.</p>
<p>One Mile - The New York Athletic Club swept the top three spots in this event. Lummis took first place with a time of 4 minutes 15 seconds. Lummis was in 12th place after the starting gun but took the lead at 500 yards and remained there until the end.</p>
<p>Two Miles - McGloughlin surpassed the crowd by 100 yards and won with a time of 10 minutes 11.6 seconds, breaking Mike Tivnan's 1919 record of 10 minutes 17.4 seconds.</p>
<p>Six Miles - Lewis Gergoly maintained his six-mile championship with a time of 31 minutes 26.4 seconds. He won against William Sansberg by jumping the last 15 yards.</p>
<p>120-Yard High Hurdles - Besse Botte, a handsome 19-year-old athlete from the New York Athletic Club, showed great skill on the waterlogged track, setting a world record with a time of 14.2 seconds, one of the most outstanding achievements of the competition. Tom Thompson's time of 14.4 seconds, set eleven years ago, is now a record of the past.</p>
<p>220-Yard Low Hurdles - The result of this event was also very outstanding. Bob Maxwell broke the previous record of 24 seconds held by Merley.</p>
<p>440-Yard Hurdles - Burke's achievement was also one of the highlights of the entire event, with a time of 54.12 seconds.</p>
<p>16-Pound Shot Put - The field was muddy, making throwing difficult. Only one person exceeded 50 feet, and that was Herman Brix, who has now won the championship for four consecutive years, with a result of 50 feet 8 and 1/4 inches.</p>
<p>35-Pound Weight Throw - The result of this event also broke a world record. The creator was New York police officer MacDonald, who weighs 350 pounds and is 52 years old. One of his throws reached a distance of 21 feet 6 inches, breaking the 18-year-old world record of 21 feet.</p>
<p>Hammer Throw - Lee Essak Dong, who weighs 230 pounds, threw the 56-pound hammer a distance of 35 feet 1 and 3/8 inches, taking first place. Second place went to MacDonald.</p>
<p>High Jump - Anton Burke once again maintained the national high jump championship, winning with a height of 6 feet 5 and 3/8 inches.</p>
<p>Relay Race - The relay race was divided into five events, including one mile, two miles, and four miles. The Los Angeles Athletic Club took first place with 18 points, and the New York Athletic Club came in second with 17 points.</p>

<p>The King's Speaker</p>
<p>The London Conference, which shook the world on July 18th, was chaired by King George. The speaker he used was extraordinary, housed in a box made of gold and silver, engraved with the royal symbols and emblems, dazzling and imposing.</p>
<p>Vegetable Flavored Ice Cream</p>
<p>Most of the ice cream sold on the market is fruit-flavored, such as banana, lemon, orange, and mulberry, which are sweet and delicious and truly a gift for our summer. However, a large city in the United States has come up with a new trick, making several kinds of vegetable ice cream, such as radish, cabbage, and celery, which have a unique flavor and are very popular among men and women.</p>
<p>A Beautifully Decorated Chapel</p>
<p>Modern young men and women like to enjoy themselves in time, flocking to dance halls and nightclubs, and regard dull and monotonous chapels as a fearful road. In view of this, the pastor of St. John's Chapel in England spent 7,000 pounds to lay orange-yellow carpets in the chapel, install turquoise chairs, and paint the walls unusually magnificently. It is said that this can attract young men and women in general.</p>
<h3 id="e111">What I Know of the Eccentric Old Man of Jiangyin <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Gongyuan</p>
<p>Recently, the Free Talk section published an article by the owner of Qifeng Tower about an eccentric old man in Jiangyin who sleeps in a coffin at night. I think this was based on hearsay. What I know is very different from this. I am from Jiangyin, and I met the eccentric old man again last year. I will describe the whole story in order to correct the record.</p>
<p>The old man lives in Yuecheng Bridge in the southern countryside of Jiangyin, about half a mile away from the villa of Mr. Zhuang Xiang, a virtuous elder of my hometown. Last summer, I visited Mr. Zhuang for business. In the evening, I took a leisurely walk with him and happened to pass the old man's residence. We met the old man at the door, and he invited us in for a short sit-down. Looking up at his residence, I saw that it was a ancestral hall. In the central hall, there was a shrine about six or seven feet wide, with a spirit tablet in the middle. Under the shrine was a lacquered coffin, half buried in the ground, with the coffin lid placed beside it. The coffin was fully equipped with clothing and bedding, neatly arranged. I was secretly puzzled but did not ask. After sitting for a while, we bid farewell and left. On the way back, I asked Mr. Zhuang about it, and Mr. Zhuang told me the details one by one, so I learned about the old man's life and the beginning and end of placing the coffin. The old man was orphaned at a young age, knew a little about reading, and his family was poor. Since he came of age, he had been diligent, frugal, and hardworking, and devoted himself to farming. Before the age of forty, he had only been to the city twice. Gradually, he started a family. By the age of seventy, he had more than a hundred acres of good land. Between 1925 and 1926, the old man suddenly divided his land into three parts. One part was given to his son, and the other two parts were sold off to build a family ancestral hall with the money. The local gentry deeply praised him. The old man said with emotion: "Trees have roots, and water has sources. Can people alone not know how to think of their parents? I am unfortunate not to have been able to serve my parents. What I am doing now is the duty that a son should fulfill." The old man has a son, who is in his thirties and also able to manage the household. However, the old man often said that he was unworthy. When neighbors asked him, he said: "I relied on my own bare hands and worked hard for more than fifty years to have what I have today. Now my son cannot continue my ambition and work hard, but instead inherits my legacy and lives a comfortable life. How can he not be unworthy?" So he separated from his son and daughter-in-law, and lived alone in the ancestral hall with his five- or six-year-old grandson, not interfering in family affairs. The old man is naturally eccentric and has different views from others. On the day the ancestral hall was completed, he purchased a coffin, clothing, and other things for his afterlife, and buried half of the coffin under the shrine. When people asked him why, the old man said: "I am in my twilight years and may die at any moment, and my heart is already settled. What else do I have to be attached to? The only thing that is difficult is that I don't know when I will die. Now I have planned for it in advance, so I can die at any time and be placed in the coffin at any time, and I will not burden my descendants with my affairs after my death. This is beneficial to both me and my descendants. As for why the coffin is buried under the shrine, it is because I will be buried under this shrine in the future. I have told my children and grandchildren, and I believe that even if my children and grandchildren are unworthy, they will definitely follow my last wishes in the future. I was not able to serve my parents in life, which is a regret to the end of my days. In this way, I can be with my ancestors forever after death, and I can avoid leaving regrets. I don't want to be buried in the hills, associating with ghosts of different surnames, and my ancestors can have my companionship, so they will not be desolate and lonely. It is convenient for both of us. This is why I buried the coffin under the shrine." The old man is seventy-six or seventy-seven years old this year, but he looks like he is in his fifties. He eats like a strong man and walks briskly. If it is not too cold or hot, he can still travel more than thirty miles back and forth between the city and the countryside in half a day. He is also a national treasure. If someone can commend and promote him, I know that he will definitely be able to improve the customs and hone the vulgar habits. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Mock Birthday Celebration for Brother Zhang Shanzi at Fifty, and Requesting a Painting of a Tiger <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's tiger paintings are treasures of the world,</p>
<p>A single piece worth a hundred or a thousand strings of cash.</p>
<p>I say Mr. Zhang is not just painting tigers,</p>
<p>But simply writing his true self with each stroke.</p>
<p>Looking at your tiger's head and swallow's chin,</p>
<p>One knows without needing a fortune teller you are destined for greatness.</p>
<p>It's a pity you refuse to put down your brush,</p>
<p>And secure peace on the border, a thousand miles, as a marquis.</p>
<p>You came back, abandoning officialdom like worn-out shoes,</p>
<p>Building a home in Weitang to entertain your relatives.</p>
<p>Your whole family is fond of good things,</p>
<p>And dedicated to painting until old age.</p>
<p>Zi'ang painted horses, making them lie down,</p>
<p>Peeking into houses, he often incurred scolding.</p>
<p>Knowing you are by nature frank and open,</p>
<p>Dancing and jumping before guests, forgetting your cap and gown.</p>
<p>When the mood strikes, you look at your reflection and paint,</p>
<p>The spots on the canvas are your true spirit.</p>
<p>I laugh at Fubo for not understanding,</p>
<p>Chasing after horses and dogs in vain repetition.</p>
<p>This year you reach fifty, your first birthday,</p>
<p>In Dafen Hall, joyful guests gather.</p>
<p>My poem is not just to wish you well,</p>
<p>But also to ask for what you owe and speak frankly.</p>
<p>You once promised me a huge painting,</p>
<p>For a year I've waited, hesitant and disappointed.</p>
<p>Will "empty big" and "empty small" come true as omens?</p>
<p>The golden hairpins in my dream have no cause to exist. (Shanzi painted Twelve Golden Hairpins, all tigers)</p>
<p>When will the tiger guest push open my door?</p>
<p>Children will run away in fright, barking incessantly.</p>
<p>The poor fellow will gladly sweep the four walls,</p>
<p>From then on, becoming rich overnight, no longer poor.</p>
<p>I must also wish you a thousand, ten thousand years of life,</p>
<p>Like the hills, like the mountains, like the great cedar tree.</p>
<p>May you read this with a smile,</p>
<p>And ask the little scribe to record it for the gentry.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Hong-Yang Rebellion and the Red-Goat Calamity <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>The two leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom happened to have one surnamed Hong (Xiuquan) and the other surnamed Yang (Xiuqing). Therefore, discussions of the Taiping events are referred to as the Hong-Yang Rebellion or the Red-Goat Calamity. Most people generally think that "Red-Goat" is a homophone for "Hong-Yang," that Hong-Yang came first and then the Red-Goat Calamity. But this is not the case. The term "Red-Goat" existed even before Hong-Yang. That is why it is said to be a coincidence. One day, a friend gave me an article about anecdotes from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, with the small characters "Red-Goat Anecdotes" added to the title. He asked me to publish it in a certain newspaper. When I saw those small characters, I jokingly asked him what "Red-Goat" meant. He said seriously, "Red-Goat is Hong-Yang. What else is there to ask?" I said, "Why not write Hong-Yang then?" He said, "It's the same. You can write either one. But writing 'Red-Goat' feels more unique." I also said, "Who taught you that?" He said impatiently, "Who needs to teach me this? Hong-Yang, Red-Goat, aren't they the same? I've seen people write 'Red-Goat' countless times, just like writing '以' as '㠯' or '法' as '灋'. Why do you have to argue with me?" Seeing that he was becoming angry from impatience, I had no choice but to stop arguing and laugh it off. Now that I think about it, I'm afraid there are still young students who misunderstand Hong-Yang and Red-Goat as one and the same. It wouldn't hurt to explain it here. Originally, during the Chunyou reign of Emperor Lizong of the Zhao Song dynasty, there was a man named Chai Wang who compiled a book called the "Bing-Ding Tortoise Mirror." It covered the period from the 52nd year of King Zhuangxiang of Qin (Bingwu) to the 12th year of the Five Dynasties Han Tianfu (Dingwei), a total of 1,260 years. During that time, there were 21 years that were Bingwu or Dingwei. Coincidentally, in those years, there were disturbances in the country. Hence the name "Bing-Ding Tortoise Mirror." After compiling it, Chai Wang presented it to Emperor Lizong, hoping that Emperor Lizong would see it and use it as a lesson from the past to avoid misgovernment. Later generations referred to times of national disaster as "Red-Goat Calamity" because Bing belongs to fire, which is red, and Wei is the goat. The surnames of the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom happened to be homophones of "Red-Goat." People at the time all considered the Qing Dynasty to be the legitimate rulers and the Taiping rebels to be bandits, so they also referred to it as the "Red-Goat Calamity." The draft written by Mr. So-and-so still had considerable respect for the Taiping and included the preface written by Sun Yat-sen for the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. If one understands the origin and meaning of the words "Red-Goat," one would not get angry and want to laugh out loud. Hehe.</p>
<p>Short News: Lin Feng'an, also known as the Master of Xihe, is famous in literary circles, especially for his calligraphy. Recently, seeing the severity of the floods in Baiyue, he made a charitable wish. He invited Zhang Yisheng, a famous painter from Yushan, to jointly organize a charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings. Hundreds of works, large and small, were numbered in order, so that those who purchased coupons could enjoy the exhibition and draw lots on a whim to claim the corresponding items. Each coupon was valued at five yuan. After deducting expenses such as mounting and ink, the remaining proceeds were all allocated to the disaster area. It is said that the dates are August 15th and 16th, and the venue will be temporarily located at the Guangdong Primary and Secondary School on Baoyuan Road, Zhabei. (Ruo Xia)</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Before Islam entered India, the Greeks ruled India for 200 years. This small island is so strong, it's strange. We learn from India, but we haven't heard of India learning from anyone. They have a famous scholar named Aryabhata, who learned arithmetic from the Greeks. A friend mentioned a book called "India and Greece," but I didn't get to see it. Also, before Islam, there was a scholar named Bhaskara who already knew about the roundness of the earth. Xuanzang and Faxian are both honored guests in Indian history. They both wrote books about India.</p>
<p>The reasons for the rise and fall of Buddhism and Hinduism are worth studying. (1) Hinduism respects cows but sacrifices goats. Buddhism prohibits killing altogether. (2) Buddhism strives to send believers to spread the word abroad. Hinduism does not. (Now it is widely spread in the United States, but it has changed.) (3) Buddhism uses various languages to spread the word widely. In the past, Hinduism did not. The reason why Buddhism declined is that after many years, monks have high status, become arrogant and corrupt, and gradually lose the faith of the masses. When things flourish, they decline. Buddhism is also like this. 2. Foreigners have helped Hinduism. 3. Hinduism produced Shankaracharya during its revival, so Buddhism was overwhelmed by him and driven out of India, only preserving its last breath in Ceylon to the south and near the snowy mountains to the north.</p>
<p>As for the similarities and differences between the Nirgrantha and Buddhism, the creator of the Nirgrantha was also a prince who became a monk, hence the name "son" indicates his clan. His clan's name is Kshatriya, the prince is in the same position as the Buddha, the prince of the Pure Rice. 2. Their precepts and beliefs in Nirvana are the same. Their differences are that Buddhists believe in the Three Jewels. The three jewels believed in by the Nirgrantha are right belief, right knowledge, and right conduct. Also, the Nirgrantha believe that starvation is a good way to liberation. Buddha does not think so.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, I toured the Ganges with the students. The water is clear and the spring flow is very slow. There is a red iron bridge to the north. I looked at it but didn't cross it. The bank of the Ganges is also known as Lohanwei, the place where all the saints practice. There are those who support a large umbrella and sit and lie under it. There are those who sit on a bench. There are those who lie in a small room. There are the disabled sitting and begging, painting their faces with five colors, and their hair naturally formed into braids, probably because they don't comb it. There are also women among them, and there are many tourists. There are those who sell Taoist books, those who sell sweets, and those who tell stories. The students said that one of their relatives has now become an immortal. I approached him, but he did not speak to me. So I went to see him, and I saw a crowd surrounding a meditator. His whole body was only tied with a rope, and a two-inch cloth strip covered his genitals. He was sitting silently, and his body was not very thin. I guess he was eating. But he didn't close his eyes but took deep breaths. There was firewood in front of him, which is what the Buddhist scriptures call fire worship. He was sitting upright with his legs crossed. I stood for a long time and didn't see anything else. I went forward again. I often study zoology. The coiling of snakes, the hibernation of frogs, and the winter sleep of insects can all last for months without food, like dead people. Those who have deep skills in cultivation are also like this.</p>

<p>— Yao Suifeng</p>
<p>It was already late, and he figured that Miss Ding must be eagerly waiting for him. But touching his pockets, he remembered that there was still one important thing he hadn't done. So he hurriedly jumped on the tram and went all the way to the main road.</p>
<p>Walking into a jewelry store, he embarrassedly took out the three pieces of gold jewelry from his pocket and said to the clerk, "These pieces are all out of style, please exchange them for cash!"</p>
<p>The clerk picked them up, looked at them carefully, put them on the scale to weigh them, and calculated carefully before saying, "A total of one tael and four mace. According to today's purchase price, it comes to one hundred and thirty-nine yuan, four jiao and five fen."</p>
<p>He was already very satisfied. After the cash and goods were cleared, he said again, "Please show me some diamond rings!"</p>
<p>The clerk changed his attitude and said very gently, "Please sit inside!"</p>
<p>When he got inside, the clerk pointed to a glass cabinet and told him to choose for himself. He looked at the cabinet, which was neatly arranged with many small boxes, each containing a diamond ring. Some were large, some were small, some had several stones set together, and some had a single stone. He felt that each one was pleasing, but he didn't know which one to choose. Then he thought that he didn't have much money, which made it even more difficult. Finally, he pointed to a relatively small one and asked the clerk to take it out.</p>
<p>"One hundred and ninety-five yuan!" The clerk looked at the number written under the box and read it out like that.</p>
<p>"That's too expensive!" he thought to himself. "Are there any cheaper ones?" he asked then.</p>
<p>"There are cheaper ones too, but I don't know how much money you are roughly prepared to spend?" the clerk said.</p>
<p>"A little over one hundred yuan would be good!"</p>
<p>Finally, he finally picked out one. He paid one hundred and twelve yuan and seven jiao, and finally got his wish for a diamond ring.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Walking out of the jewelry store, he felt much lighter and much more relaxed in his heart. He immediately hired a rickshaw to Tongfu Road, without even bargaining, just telling the rickshaw puller to run fast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miss Ding had been waiting for a long time. Just as she was getting impatient, she suddenly heard the doorbell ring and told Qiuzi to open the door.</p>
<p>Qiuzi came back in and reported to Miss Ding with a surprised expression, "The one who came is a Mr. Li!"</p>
<p>"Did you refuse him?" Miss Ding was very unhappy.</p>
<p>"Yes! I know that Miss won't be meeting other guests today, so I have already refused him, saying that you are not at home." Qiuzi smiled slightly.</p>

<p>Consolidated Tax Bonds Soar by More Than Three Yuan, Other Bonds Also Rise by One or Two Yuan</p>
<p>Transaction Volume Reaches Over 25.5 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market situation at the local securities exchange was that the spot market was as deserted as before, while the futures market suddenly became extremely lively. The enthusiasm of buyers and sellers was very strong. The September contracts had mostly opened. Major bonds all had huge transaction volumes, because bond prices had undergone huge changes and the market was lively. An investigation of the trend of bond prices showed that due to the optimistic situation in the north and a major turning point in the situation, the market was shrouded in buying interest as soon as the bonds opened. The demand and supply were very different, and prices soared sharply, continuing to rise significantly compared to the previous weekend. Later, selling interest also turned strong, but the buying side still dominated, and prices continued to rise. The trend has become much more peaceful. As a result, Consolidated Tax Bonds rose by three yuan, the 20 Customs Surtax Military Reduction Bonds and the 19 Customs Treaty Bonds rose by two yuan, and others also rose significantly. The volume of spot transactions was only 5,000 yuan, while futures transactions totaled over 25.5 million yuan. Arbitrage transactions were quite active. In addition, the transaction volume of Consolidated Tax Bonds has surpassed other bonds.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Cotton Yarn: Temporary Halt to the Market Decline <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market's declining trend has slightly subsided, but the overall trend remains weak. This is primarily due to the global cotton industry's weakness, exerting continuous pressure. Additionally, a certain merchant's uncovered positions continue to be dumped, further weakening market sentiment. Moreover, this year, various provinces within the country have suffered from flood disasters, resulting in significant damage to rice paddies. The harvest year is already considered poor, which will weaken farmers' purchasing power in the future, leading to a greater number of short sellers. However, the Rongxing firm's long positions remain calm and unmoved, making it difficult to be overly optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>People's Standard Market Sentiment Remains Flat: The exchange's People's Standard market opened with flat sentiment. Prices for various months rose slightly by 0.12 to 0.3 percent, but then flattened again in the afternoon, falling by 0.12 percent. The total volume traded was 45,450 bales. Sales included 1,250 bales from Xincheng, 1,000 bales from Ruid, 1,250 bales from Hefeng, and 750 bales from Lichang. Purchases included 1,100 bales from Yud, 1,300 bales from Daji, 950 bales from Ruid, and 800 bales from Changfeng. The closing prices for People's Standard are recorded below:</p>

<p>October: 159.6 95,100 January: 161.6 4 27,050</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Sluggish: Spot yarn sales are relatively stagnant. Statistics show that all guilds purchased a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day, with fellow merchants taking in 440 bales. Market conditions are flat and weak. Customer guilds reported taking in 265 bales for inland areas, 240 bales for Chongqing, 40 bales for Changsha, 50 bales for Guangdong, 155 bales for Tianjin, 75 bales for Qingdao, and 135 bales for miscellaneous regions.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Cotton Market Slightly Calmer <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>American Cotton Awaits Rebound</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly calmer, but the overall situation remains very weak. This is because the global cotton industry is still in a pessimistic state. Moreover, there are reports of India devaluing and selling off its cotton, and the American cotton carryover has been announced at a massive 9.13 million bales. This huge amount of inventory is causing great unease. Therefore, merchants are taking a negative view of the overall trend and, as the tide turns, are painfully liquidating their long positions, leading to a loosening of the market. However, some are anticipating a potential rebound after several days of consecutive declines in American cotton prices. Considering the global situation, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Large Holders Continue to Dump: The exchange's Hankou Standard market opened with a slight rally, as news of the United States lending goods to Germany boosted confidence. Prices for various months rose by 0.3 percent. However, large holders sold in the second and third rounds, causing prices to fall again. As a result, prices rose by 0.15 percent. The afternoon was flat, with fluctuations of 0.05 percent. The total volume traded was 111,600 dan. Sales included 6,000 dan from Ruid, 5,900 dan from Xincheng, 3,000 dan from Yongfeng, and 2,300 dan from Yichang. Purchases included 4,000 dan from Jifeng, 6,000 dan from Taixing, 3,800 dan from Changfeng, 2,100 dan from Daji, and 2,600 dan from Yuchang.

<p>Price Comparison with Liverpool Gradually Approaching</p>
<p>A dispatch from Mumbai on August 1st reported on the cotton market conditions during the past week, stating that local sentiment did not anticipate any decline in the cotton market. Therefore, despite the weakening of American cotton prices, there was no significant impact. The stability of the market was mainly due to exchange brokers buying when prices fell. As a result, the price comparison between Mumbai and Liverpool became closer. The spot cotton market is extremely quiet, with Japanese merchants showing no interest in buying. European demand remains stagnant. Local factories are maintaining their operational capacity, while Lancashire is focusing on new cotton and cheaper, medium-grade goods.

<p>South Market: Yesterday, sources numbered 20-30. Urban and rural shops were selling. The weather was clear and sunny, but buying interest seemed low and trading appetite was weak. As a result, prices were slightly soft. Thick japonica rice saw a small decline of 0.2 yuan. Thin indica rice arrivals were slightly more receptive, but supply of Ningbo rice remained scarce. Street sales were moving, but sporadically, and prices were also down 0.1-0.2 yuan. Reed-ocean premium goods were sparsely sold but remained firm in shape. Silver dollars for cash sales were flat, with no gains or losses. New early rice from Pudong arrived yesterday, with over forty stones. The opening price was slightly less than half a yuan. Shenli, Xinchang, Yuchengtai, and Hecheng four companies purchased it. Imported rice was also seeing thinner customer demand due to the clear and sunny weather, and the street market was particularly quiet. The market showed a weak and sluggish state.</p>
<p>New Rice Market: Yesterday, the weather cleared up. There were very few people at the early morning market. Thick japonica rice, high and secondary grades, fell back by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Arrivals of thin indica rice surged, but sales were sluggish. Inventory remained high, and the situation led to a drop of 0.4-0.5 yuan. Reed-ocean premium rice saw poor customer demand, but prices did not rise or fall. Glutinous rice river inventory was scarce, with only three bamboo tubes remaining. After a few pecks were sold, the overall price increased by nearly a foot. The second batch of new early rice from Zhoupu, around 100 dan, arrived, and various rice mills were selling it. Market conditions were similar to those in the southern district. Boats arriving from inner roads were numbered 21-22.</p>

<p>Distant Futures Improve by One Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months initially showed a flat and then rising trend. Because the price of imported wheat only improved by about 0.1-0.2 yuan, most factories were wary due to the large batches released at the end of the previous week. Later, due to the ongoing flood disasters in various places, with the Gaoyou dam bursting and the water volume in the Yangtze River area increasing rather than decreasing, buying interest revived, and absorption occurred step by step. Factories remained calm and cautious, with very few batches released. Observation suggests that the situation may temporarily stabilize, as the courage of the inland groups has not yet declined. As a result, the price for this month remained unchanged compared to the end of the previous week, September improved by 0.05 percent, October improved by 0.1 percent, November/December improved by 0.125 percent, and January improved by 0.175 percent.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Wheat Market Sees Another Surge <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>13,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, prices for various months did not fluctuate much compared to the closing price of the previous week. As the price of imported wheat only improved by about 0.1-0.2 yuan, both buyers and sellers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, prices showed a slightly firm trend amidst the fluctuations. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, due to the improvement in flour prices in the morning and the lack of activity in selling imported wheat, inland groups were ultimately driven by the severity of flood disasters in various places to compete for purchases, causing prices in all sectors to surge again. Although factories sold imported wheat for hedging, the market sentiment remained firm. As a result, the price for this month rose by 0.05 percent compared to the previous week, September/October rose by 0.07 percent, and November/December rose by 0.06 percent. Spot wheat arrivals were insufficient, and inventory was dwindling daily. The combined Shanghai standard price at the place of origin was close to 0.7-0.8 yuan. Therefore, high-quality goods were also quoted at 0.72-0.73 yuan, while medium and lower grades remained flat. Over 13,000 bags of wheat from Penglai, Anqing, Danyang, Qiyan, Zhenjiang, Pudong, Changshu, Taicang, Yangzhou, Shuangfeng, Nanjing, Kunshan, etc., were sold, including 6,000 bags handled by Shenda and Xinda, 4,000 bags handled by Fuxin, and over 3,000 bags handled by Huafeng.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market remained sluggish. Overseas silk sales showed no sign of recovery, and silk telegraphs were unchanged yesterday. The market sentiment was depressed. Yesterday, only Weicheng Silk Factory brought in five bales of Shanghai white silk (spot), and Dachang brought in ten bales of white dry silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e127">New York Raw Silk Consumption Greatly Reduced <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Totaled Only 40,000+ Bales in July</p>
<p>The United States is the country with the largest consumption of raw silk. New York silk weaving factories are numerous, and the demand for silk is especially strong, requiring 50,000-60,000 bales per month. Since the start of summer, the heat has been unusually high, and silk weaving factories have suspended work, greatly reducing the consumption of raw silk. Last month, countries such as Japan, Italy, and France consumed a total of only 42,500 bales of raw silk, a decrease of nearly 20,000 bales compared to the peak month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm tea market saw increasing interest in fine eyebrow green teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi, handled by Yongxing, Baochang, Jinlong, Xiehe, and other firms. Overall market trading was unusually brisk, and market prices continued to rise firmly by 0.6-0.7 taels. Foreign tea merchants adopted an increasingly firm attitude due to the limited inventory and sources in the market. Needle eyebrow and Xiumei teas, due to the good prices for tea residue this year in inland areas and the scarcity of supply, are currently in a situation where supply falls short of demand in the market. In addition, for Gongxi tea, the Russian Assistance Association foreign firm resumed inspecting new samples yesterday, preparing to start operations. The green tea market is gradually showing positive signs.</p>

<p>The first batch of new white lotus seeds has arrived, and the goods are relatively dry and clean. Yesterday, they were sold at 37 taels, while old goods were sold at 36 taels. Market sentiment was stable. (New candied dates) Yesterday, it was reported that over a dozen barrels of Jiaxing goods had arrived, and sales were expected to start, with a price of 36 taels. Formal Anhui goods would still take time to arrive, and prices would certainly be higher.</p>

<p>Metal trading remained flat yesterday, resulting in a lack of major transactions throughout the market, except for a few minor deals. However, in terms of arrivals, another 2,400-2,500 boxes of large and small tinplate arrived yesterday. In terms of prices, there is likely to be no hope of price increases in the future. Currently, American 90-pound goods are estimated at 15.75 taels, and 100-pound goods are estimated at 17 taels. For British goods, 90-pound goods are estimated at 14 taels, 100-pound goods are estimated at 15.5 taels, and 200-pound goods are estimated at 30 taels. Many factories are trading, but customer guild deals are particularly sparse.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Two Courts Held Office Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Hearing of Eight Criminal Cases</p>
<p>The Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court both officially began operations yesterday, and at the same time began to add civil and criminal divisions. The Second Special District Local Court then reopened for the first time at noon, hearing eight criminal cases. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Beginning of Operations　The presidents of the two courts ordered all staff to report to the court to sign in and begin work from yesterday.</p>
<p>Court Hearing Cases　Yesterday morning around 10 o'clock, the various criminal cases sent to the Second Special District Local Court by the French Concession Police Department were accepted in the criminal court downstairs at around 12:15 noon. Judge Luo Renji, along with Prosecutor Ding Shikui and Clerk Wang Baoxun, took their seats in the criminal court to hear minor cases, which were completed at 1:15. A total of six theft cases, one opium case, and one kidnapping case requested by the Kunshan authorities were heard. The results were very orderly, and there were many spectators. Judge Luo ordered that the defendants be temporarily detained in the detention center and that a retrial be held on the 18th. As for the requested kidnapping case, it has not yet been transferred because there were no formal official documents and no evidence was presented. It will be transferred once the official documents are received and evidence is presented, it is said.</p>
<p>Continued Appointment of Judges　The Ministry of Judicial Administration continued to appoint personnel to the Higher Third Branch and the Second Special District Local Court in the French Concession of Shanghai as follows: Court Clerks of the Higher Third Branch: Yin Tingxiang, Luo Zonglu, Peng Jianbiao, Qin Shougong, Liu Jiayi, Zhou Che, Shi Ji; Court Clerk of the Prosecutor's Office of the Higher Second Branch: Yao Rongsen; Translator: Peng Wangyong; Court Clerks of the Second Special District Local Court: Zhang JiongGuang, Qian Lisheng, Wu Peihong, Zhu ChaoZhuo, Wu Shan.

As for the president of the court of the First Special District, Zhou Daren has been appointed, as well as Judges Shen Bingrong, Guo Shouyi, and Li Mo. Zhao Fengxian has also been appointed as the sub-warden of the Shanghai Second Prison, it is said.</p>
<p>Banking Sector</p>
<h3 id="e153">Important Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Collection of Paper Money Tax and Income Tax</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, concerning the Ministry of Finance's plan to levy taxes on the issuance of banknotes and income tax from the banking industry, the banking sector in this city generally believes that this matter is of great importance and has a significant impact on the future of the banking industry. There is also a question of whether Chinese and foreign banks will be taxed equally. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, a special members' meeting was convened at the clubhouse at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss opinions on this matter. Representatives from all members of the association attended. Mr. Hu Mengjia of the Bank of Communications presided over the meeting and immediately announced the reason for convening the meeting, requesting members to express their opinions on the above two taxes. After a long discussion, it was decided to first solicit the opinions of all member banks. Furthermore, considering that this tax issue concerns the survival of the entire banking industry nationwide, the association also issued notices to banks that have not yet joined the Banking Association, requesting them to conduct thorough research on this matter immediately and submit all opinions to the Banking Association for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the Banking Associations in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places, urging them to quickly express their opinions on this tax law for mutual reference. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM. Regarding this matter, the Huadong News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, a standing committee member of the Banking Association, yesterday to inquire about the opinions of the meeting on the two new taxes. According to Mr. Lin, since the regulations on banknote issuance and income tax were announced, the banking industry has learned that the proponent of this plan was the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance. After the proposal was made, the government naturally welcomed the large tax revenue, as it was legitimate and justified. Chinese bankers, as members of the nation, have no reason to object. However, it is believed that the Chinese banking industry is still in its infancy, and the government is imposing a significant burden on it. There are still several points that raise doubts: First, whether the collection methods for banknote issuance tax and income tax are the same for Chinese and foreign banks, or whether only Chinese banks are subject to the tax while foreign banks are exempt. Second, regarding the general plan for the banknote issuance tax, reports indicate that those with reserves will not be taxed, while those without reserves will be subject to the tax. However, upon investigation, all Chinese and foreign banks do not have a fixed amount of banknote issuance. The nature of banknotes is fluid; one day, ten million may be issued, and the next day, five million may be received. Therefore, does the Ministry of Finance have clear regulations on this point? Third, the nature of income tax is a disguised business tax. The business tax rates in various provinces and cities are calculated in thousandths, but the income tax law promulgated by the national government today stipulates that those with net income below 15% will be taxed at 5%, those with 15% to 25% will be taxed at 7.05%, those with 25% to 35% will be taxed at 10%, and those above 35% will be taxed at 15%. The high tax rate far exceeds the business tax in various provinces and cities. Why does the Ministry of Finance place such a heavy tax burden on the banking industry alone? All these points raise deep concerns among the banking industry. Our country's banking industry has been severely weakened by the oppression and competition from foreign banks. In recent years, people in society have begun to realize the fear of foreign banks' manipulation and have begun to pay attention to our country's banking industry. In recent years, the Chinese banking industry has shown good signs of gradual progress. The government should consider ways to reward and promote it to encourage it. But now, it is not doing so. Moreover, if foreign banks are exclusively exempt, it is tantamount to severely damaging our country's entire banking industry. How can the Chinese banking industry fully develop in the future to compete with foreign banks? Furthermore, it is rumored that this proposal comes from the strategy of the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance. On the surface, it seems to be a good plan for our government, but on the reverse side, the reason for suggesting that the national government collect this regulation is to resist Chinese banks in disguise, so that our immature Chinese banking industry will be hit and give the foreign banks the opportunity to expand as much as possible. Thinking of this, how can we not be afraid? Therefore, the majority of the conference advocated that the Ministry of Finance treat Chinese and foreign banks equally. This is not only for the sake of our country's banking industry itself, but also for the sake of our country's entire financial industry.</p>

<p>Mayor Zhang Received Two Telegrams Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang received a telegram from the General Headquarters of the Nanchang Campaign Command, which read: Urgent, to Mayor Zhang Xun of Shanghai, (1) The comprehensive situation of suppressing the Red Army here is as follows: Our forward troops have bravely attacked and have been invincible, successively recovering Guangchang, Ningdu, Shicheng, Ruijin, Xingguo, and other counties. The central areas of the bandit nest, such as Huangpo, Xiaobu, Longgang, Donggu, and other locations of the false political agencies, were also completely occupied in July. According to statistics, more than ten thousand bandits were killed in various battles, and more than forty thousand were captured. Other weapons, military supplies, documents, hostages, livestock, etc., are even more difficult to count. The main force has been pushed back, and the remaining scattered bandits will be cleared soon. (2) Recently, Vice Commander Zhang reported to the Commander that the whole story had been telegraphed. At dawn today, our Northern Route Army launched a full-scale attack, luring the enemy's main force to the Xiaolizhuang and Qingfengdian areas, completely surrounding them. After our fierce attack, they collapsed and retreated towards Dingzhou and Anguo, with more than half of their casualties, rendering them ineffective. At the moment, I have also dispatched another unit to outflank and raid. Our Jin army has also advanced rapidly to the east, closely following the tail. Shi rebel has no way to escape and is trapped in a heavy siege. A complete solution is just around the corner. This telegram is specially sent for your information. General Headquarters of the Nanchang Campaign Command. On the 21st day of Dongshen. Mayor Zhang also received another telegram from Vice Commander Zhang from Beiping, which read: Confidential, to my dear brother Yuejun, Mayor Zhang Xun of Shanghai.

(2) Our air force bombed the ferries in Shenze this morning, killing many enemies, and the enemy was in chaos and scattered. (3) Our right-wing pursuit team captured more than 20 enemy cannons and countless spoils last night in Dingzhou. (4) Our left-wing pursuit team is pursuing towards Shenze. (5) Our cavalry group is searching and blocking along the Hutuo River. In addition to ordering the Northern Route Army to advance and pursue fiercely, and also telegraphed the Southern Route Army to rush to intercept, I report to you. Your brother Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<h3 id="e155">No Extension for Registration of Japanese Goods <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Both Expressed Their Views</p>
<p>Deadline is the Sixth According to the Resolution</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee previously decided at its first executive committee meeting that the deadline for registering purchased Japanese goods would be the 15th, from July 23 to August 6. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a temporary general meeting of members on the 24th, and it was also decided to conduct a registration of Japanese goods in member stores, with a two-week deadline, from the 24th to August 6 as well. It is reported that a large number of people have gone to register in recent days. The association issued announcements and letters yesterday, stating that the registration deadline would not be extended. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement of the Anti-Japanese Association The Anti-Japanese Association issued its eighth announcement yesterday, stating: The registration of Japanese goods by our association will end on the 6th of this month according to the resolution of the Executive Committee. It is hoped that all merchants and citizens in the city will come to the association before the deadline to register their accumulated Japanese goods in accordance with the regulations. Do not delay yourselves. This is very important.</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the South Goods Trade Association yesterday, stating: Reply to your letter requesting that the Anti-Japanese Association extend the deadline for registering Japanese goods and exempt payment of relief funds. The registration deadline was decided by the temporary meeting of members of our association on July 27 and cannot be extended. As for the relief fund measures, according to the resolution of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee, it is only collected for Japanese goods purchased and paid for with silver after the 14th and before the 24th, not for all Japanese goods. Collection must be made, and the association has already announced this in the newspaper. The requests in your letter seem difficult to accommodate. Please check and inform.</p>
<p>Announcement of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e156">Do Not Raise the Price of Domestic Goods <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Resisting Japanese Goods is a Good Opportunity to Promote Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified the trade associations of all industries yesterday, stating: According to a letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Committee, on the 28th of this month, the printing industry labor union sent a letter requesting restrictions on the opportunistic price increases of domestic goods to benefit the people's livelihood. At this time of national economic severance with Japan, it is the only time to widely consume domestic goods. However, a few merchants often take the opportunity to raise prices, losing the public's faith in purchasing for small profits, which is deeply regrettable. According to the letter, the above situation should be informed and checked. Approved. The whole city is now enthusiastically resisting Japanese goods, which is indeed a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. It is appropriate to have fair prices to stimulate public interest in purchasing. Do not raise prices as a result, which may cause repercussions. According to the letter, corresponding notices are hereby given, and all members are requested to check, inform, and comply.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant Customs Brokerage</p>
<h3 id="e157">Taking the Opportunity to Solicit the Declaration and Loading of Japanese Goods <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Customs Brokerage Houses Are Greatly Panicked</p>
<p>However, They Still Refuse to Load and Await Government Prohibition</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Anti-Japanese and Aid-Overseas Chinese Association implemented economic severance with Japan, the transshipment and customs declaration industry has implemented automatic refusal to load Japanese goods. In order to prevent Japanese customs brokerage houses from taking the opportunity to contract loading and transportation, a request was submitted to the authorities for prohibition. Unexpectedly, Japanese customs brokerage houses such as Higuchi, Yamaguchi, and Yiji sent personnel to contract the loading and transportation of Japanese goods separately, and they even contained insurance. There are even newly opened Japanese customs brokerage houses specializing in the declaration of Japanese goods, causing more than 800 Chinese customs brokerage houses, such as Yuanfeng and Kunk, to panic. However, in order to implement the spirit of patriotism, they have no choice but to wait for the authorities to take measures to prohibit them. Yesterday, the association received an instruction from the Municipal Party Department, which read: According to the report for prohibiting Japanese customs brokerage houses to facilitate commercial transportation, the request has been forwarded to the central government for approval. Please comply.</p>

<p>I Will Still Work Hard While in Office</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting replied to Yu Qiaqing's letter, stating: Dear Elder Brother Qia Lao, I received your frugal telegram. Your words are earnest and sincere. After reading it respectfully, I am filled with shame and gratitude. The Chairman often tells the people that the responsibility of office is to fulfill obligations, not to enjoy rights. I have followed the Premier for many years and have always taken revolution as my ambition. I regard the affairs of the party and the country as our duty. Therefore, since taking office, I have been dedicated and tireless, and I do not complain. You, my brother, know this well. When the Korean massacre occurred, it was my duty to work hard. I also wish to be no less patriotic than others. However, people's opinions differ. I try my best to fulfill my obligations, but others may see them as rights. If it is a matter of rights, I can immediately resign to give way to the capable. This is the reason for my resolute request for resignation this time. Since I am encouraged by righteousness, I dare not refuse. While in office, I will continue to work hard to fulfill my responsibilities. I hope you will understand my foolishness. I send this telegram to thank you and wish you well. Your younger brother Wang Zhengting.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Hengtong Steamer Sinks in Shaobo <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Crew Safe</p>
<p>The China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau's Zhenjiang-Yangzhou steamer Hengtong was ordered to sail during the suspension of service in Yangzhou. When it was near Shaobo, the ship crashed and sank immediately. All the crew members escaped from the water. The loss was huge. The report was received in Shanghai yesterday. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Adventurous Departure The twenty-six routes of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau's steamers were all suspended due to the major flood disaster last month. The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou steamer Hengtong was suspended in Yangzhou from July 15. On July 28, the steamer was suddenly ordered to go to Qingjiangpu, towing four civilian boats in Yangzhou, and had to set off immediately. At that time, the director of the Yangzhou branch and the captain of the ship both said that the water was high along the way and the voyage was dangerous and could not be carried out. However, the negotiations were unsuccessful, and the shipowners had no choice but to start from Yangzhou, towing the four civilian boats, and taking the risk to Qingjiangpu.</p>
<p>Accident on the Way The water along the way was extremely high, and the farmland on both sides was flooded. Navigation was very difficult. The shipowner drove slowly to avoid collision and prevent farmers from obstructing navigation and sabotage. That night, when it was about ten miles away from Shaobo's Bihuba, it was already dark, and the water was turbulent and extremely dangerous. The shipowner thought that it could not be opened any more, and he wanted to stop sailing and wait for the next day to drive after dawn. Unexpectedly, this aroused the anger of the escorts, who whipped and forced the shipowner to drive. One crew member was beaten and injured and did not dare to disobey. So they negotiated to change the tow twice. Because of the high tide and rapid current of Bihuba, they were afraid that all four ships would be overturned. After negotiation, Hengtong first towed two ships, and in the dark, they rushed through the dangerous area with the current and arrived at Shaobo.</p>
<p>Ship Sinks The first time was a fluke success at great risk. The second time, Hengtong went to Bihuba again to tow the boat. It was already late at night, and the water flow was even more fierce. When it was about to reach the civilian boat, the person on the boat ordered to advance quickly. As a result, the bottom of the Hengtong ship crashed into a large iron anchor on the civilian boat parked on the dam shore. The anchor tip broke the bottom of the wheel, and the river water poured into the wheel frantically. In a short time, the wheel body was submerged in the river. Dozens of people on the wheel luckily jumped into the civilian boat to avoid danger, while the crew members jumped into the water one after another and fled to the shore. They were also afraid that the wheel would be washed away by the flood. Fortunately, the shipowner tied the rope to the deck on the shore in a hurry. Therefore, although the wheel was completely submerged, it was still on the river bank. All public and private items were completely submerged in the wheel and could not be taken out. The loss amounted to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Send Someone to Investigate Thoroughly Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a report and immediately sent staff member Bai Gongbi, who was dispatched by Manager Zhang Jingpei, to Yangzhou to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and verify whether the wheel had any hope of being towed and rescued, because the Hengtong wheel was the best steamer of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau. The crew members who escaped have returned to Yangzhou to report to the branch. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau reported the Hengtong wheel accident to the Zhejiang Construction Department through the Secretariat, and requested that the Ministry of Communications be notified that no risky forced departures should be made during the flood period.</p>

<p>Disaster Reports Received by Various Groups</p>
<p>Red Cross Society The Chinese Red Cross Society received three important telegrams yesterday: 1. Wei Ruifeng and Wu Jiasan, special disaster investigators sent by the Red Cross Society to Jiangxi, telegraphed: Jiangxi Province has been suffering from continuous rain in recent days. Low-lying areas have become swamps due to flash floods, with Yongxiu, De'an, Jiujiang, Hukou, Fengcheng, Xingan, and Xiajiang being the most severely affected. Other areas such as Ji'an, Anfu, and Wan'an are also suffering from heavy rain. Most of the crops have been submerged. After suffering from the communist disaster first, they are now suffering from natural disasters again. For days, wired communication has been blocked by water, and wireless communication has been temporarily suspended due to military use. The Nanxun Road has also been blocked by water, making reporting extremely difficult. This telegram was sent by Commander Xiong on behalf of the investigators. 2. The Wanzhizhen Chamber of Commerce telegraphed: From the 20th of this month, the Qingyi River Basin has been experiencing torrential rain. On the 2nd, mountain floods broke out suddenly and poured down directly, coupled with the backflow of the river tide, the water volume increased repeatedly, resulting in the successive collapse of more than 40 embankments, especially on the afternoon of the 25th, the western part of the town was the most tragic, with more than half of the people and houses dead, injured, and washed away. The cries of the hungry and displaced can be heard everywhere, and the corpses are all over the river. Currently, there are 200,000 disaster victims waiting to be rescued. 3. The Yingshang Red Cross Society telegraphed: This time, the Huai and Ying rivers overflowed, and the flood disaster suffered by our county is greater than that of the tenth year of the Republic of China and heavier than that of Fuyang. Tens of thousands of houses have been submerged and collapsed, and the number of floating firewood, drowned people and animals is countless.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Society The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society received a letter from the Finance Bureau of Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, stating: Our hometown is adjacent to the river and lake, and the land is the lowest-lying, relying entirely on embankments to block the water. This year, the spring flood broke out, and the river tide was full early. Unexpectedly, the recent heavy rain has been torrential for five days without stopping, and dozens of embankment collapses have been connected. Seeing the disaster victims, it is very pitiful. Our bureau has organized an emergency relief committee in advance, but a drop in the bucket is of no avail. I especially send a telegram to appeal, and I implore you to directly grant relief funds, awaiting orders. Also, a telegram from various institutions and groups in Hexian County stated: Hexian County has suffered from soldiers, bandits, locusts, and droughts in recent years, and the suffering of the people is indescribable. But the sky has not ended the disaster, and the people are still suffering. First, there was continuous spring rain, and recently there has been heavy rain, resulting in mountain floods and sudden rises in the river tide. All the weirs have become swamps. Some farmland, rice fields, and houses have been washed away, and some people have been drowned. The whole area is desolate, and life is almost extinct. What will be the solution to the aftermath? I think your association is concerned about the suffering of the people and is meticulous. I especially submit the disaster situation and give relief. Also, a public letter from the Jiangpu County Government of Jiangsu Province stated that unfortunately, since July, there has been continuous heavy rain and flash floods. The seedlings have rotted, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The water depth in the plains is several feet, and all the houses, livestock, and furniture have been lost. Many people have died due to the sudden flood and the inability to avoid it. At present, the victims have nowhere to live and no food to eat. Please give relief quickly. Also, a telegram from the Jiangning County Government of Jiangsu Province stated that there has been continuous heavy rain in our county, and mountain floods have broken out. 70 to 80 percent of the large and small dikes in the county have been submerged and collapsed, and those that have not collapsed are still in danger. Farmland and houses are almost submerged. The Jinghu Line, from Yaohuamen to Hepingmen, is particularly overflowing with water, with several feet of water and a vast ocean along the line. The victims are displaced, eating and sleeping in the open, and the situation is extremely miserable. The situation is unbearable to see. Now the transportation of the whole county is completely blocked. The disaster is so severe that it has not been seen in decades. Please provide relief. Also, a telegram from the Provisional Flood Relief Committee of Quanjiao County, Anhui stated that the flood disaster in Quanjiao is extremely severe. The provincial government has allocated 2,000 yuan for emergency relief, which is being distributed. Heavy rain for two days and nights, and the flood rushed urgently, and countless people and animals were drowned. The cries of the victims are unbearable to hear. The weirs have long been broken, and the mountain fields have been completely submerged. The autumn harvest is hopeless. The conference decided to temporarily move the relief funds for distribution. Please send someone to investigate and quickly allocate emergency relief to save the victims.</p>
<p>Anhui Fellow Association This summer, there has been heavy rain and disaster. Except for the mountain counties, the remaining counties along the river and Huai River in Anhui Province have been flooded and have become disaster areas. The Anhui Fellow Association in this port has received telegrams requesting relief like snowflakes. The misery of the disaster is difficult to describe. In recent days, the association's staff has been discussing and convening an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors to organize the Anhui Flood Relief Association, dividing it into three departments: fundraising, writing and art. The three departments will proceed together. The calligraphy and painting department invites famous calligraphers and painters from Anhui, such as Xu Jingren, Xu Jilong, Huang Binhong, Wang Juyou, and Xu Shiqi, to take on the task, and all proceeds will be used to help relieve the disaster. Here is a record of the reply telegram from the National Government Relief Committee and the Anhui Provincial Government: 1. According to the Chairman's delegation, your association respectfully telegraphed that the counties along the river and Huai River in this province are suffering from heavy rain and disaster, which is an unprecedented catastrophe. You have described the situation in detail, requesting that the national treasury be issued quickly for emergency relief and that labor relief be arranged to guide the Huai River, and that the provincial government be ordered to rush to repair the dikes along the river. The instructions have been delegated to the Executive Yuan, etc. In addition to sending a letter, corresponding letters are issued for reference. National Government Civil Service Office. 2. Approved and respectfully delegated telegrams that according to the reports from the counties bordering the Jiang and Huai Rivers in Anhui Province, the flood disaster is severe and it is requested that the national treasury be issued quickly for emergency relief. The Anhui disaster is severe, and reports have been received from various parties, which is deeply sad. However, in recent years, various provinces have submitted reports of flood disasters, and letters and telegrams have been sent one after another requesting relief. The association is now doing its best to plan and submit it to the Executive Yuan for the issuance of large sums of money for relief. Once the fundraising is completed, a meeting will be held to discuss the allocation separately. Special telegram reply, Relief Committee. 3. Respectfully and diligently read the telegram. The counties in this province bordering the Jiang and Huai Rivers have been severely flooded, and the county governments have successively submitted reports to the government, and each has been ordered to properly appease and relieve the disaster and allocate 1,200 yuan for emergency relief. However, due to the province's odd shortage and the heavy disaster, the government has repeatedly telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and Relief Committee to quickly allocate large sums of money for relief, which is on file. However, considering that the disaster situation in each county is extremely severe, and the difficulties of the time cannot be remedied without concerted efforts. I hope that your association will embrace the people of the same race and do your best to persuade and raise funds to save the drowning and hunger together. The Anhui Provincial Government seals the world.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Cry After the Summer Rain Disaster <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Agricultural Association Pours Out Grievances of Crop Failure, Requesting Tax Exemption</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Agricultural Association submitted a document to the County Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the request, the agricultural associations of the First Township, Fourth District, and other townships reported that since the beginning of the month, there have been continuous torrential rains. During this period of intense heat, the river water has risen sharply, and low-lying fields are flooded with ankle-deep water, unable to drain. Cotton seedlings are rotting at the roots, and they are vulnerable to withering in the sudden intense sunlight. Although high-lying fields are not flooded, the prolonged overcast skies have prevented sunlight, causing the seedlings to sprout and become as tender as vegetables, with no flower buds at all. The rice seedlings are about to produce weeds. This heavy rain and strong wind have destroyed most of them, making it difficult to yield a harvest. As for beans, melons, fruits, vegetables, and other developed agricultural products, many have suffered leaf blight and withered, making it difficult to thrive. At a time when the country is in turmoil, with continuous warfare, farmers have suffered repeated disasters. Taxes are heavy, and prices are high. Even the various trades and crafts rely on agriculture. A full harvest every year already feels like a heavy burden. Now, suddenly faced with this natural disaster, the autumn harvest is bound to be disappointing. Our association is deeply concerned but lacks the means to remedy the situation. The public is panicking and strongly appeals for help. Therefore, we specially request your esteemed association to send personnel to investigate the situation on the ground and report the disaster to the County Government, who in turn should request the Provincial Government to devise a method of assistance. We sincerely hope you will consider this matter." Upon receiving this, it was found that the widespread rain disaster affected a large area. Although the county is located near the coast and has not immediately become a swamp, the impact on the young crops, which are crucial for yielding a harvest, is significant. At a time when the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, the lives of farmers are such that many do not have enough grain to eat from one morning to the next, and they resort to pawning and borrowing, living hand to mouth. A good harvest year is already a struggle to sustain themselves, and facing a famine, they will inevitably cry out in hunger and cold. In accordance with the previous report, special personnel were repeatedly dispatched to the countryside to investigate the disaster, and the report was found to be accurate. Therefore, we have prepared a document to submit to your esteemed office, requesting that you promptly telegraph the Provincial Government to ask for a reduction or exemption of taxes to provide relief, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Grain Committee Requests to Hold a Food Exhibition <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>As a Prelude to Comprehensively Solving the People's Food Problem</p>
<p>The Municipal Grain Committee believes that the public's food panic is worsening year by year, and this year, with frequent floods, signs of famine are already apparent. To address both the symptoms and the root cause, it is necessary to implement separate measures. It has already submitted a request to the central government to organize a food exhibition, which has been approved and forwarded. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for holding the exhibition (omitted above): In recent years, national affairs have been tumultuous, and the people's livelihood has been exhausted. Foreign aggression has not ceased, and banditry in the hinterland still exists. The price of silver has plummeted, and foreign goods are dumped into the market, devastating industry and commerce. Agricultural products are also declining daily. Each year, food imports, considering only rice, wheat, and flour, already amount to about 200 million yuan. If we include seafood, livestock products, and canned foods, the total is over 300 million yuan. It is thought that the amount of imports over exports of our country in recent years is about 200 million taels of customs silver, which is equivalent to about 300 million yuan in national currency. If there were no such huge imports of food products, then our country could maintain a balanced state in international trade. Now, a country known to the world as an agricultural nation is in such a state. What is its impact on the people's livelihood? What is its impact on the national economy? It is a great shame for our nation and a great crisis for our country. From this perspective, the people's livelihood problem and the national economy problem are also the food problem. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to encourage production and improve distribution. Increased production will ensure sufficient food for the people, and equitable distribution will stabilize grain prices. With sufficient food and stable prices, the people's hardship will be alleviated. As for increasing production and improving distribution, it is important to have on-site guidance and research to achieve practical results. Promotion and observation are particularly sufficient to encourage the people, so that they know to be vigilant and think of self-help. This committee believes that the planning of the food exhibition cannot be delayed. (1) Although the country has felt the pain of food shortages in recent years, it is not yet clear about the reality of insufficient production. For example, how much does a certain province produce? How much does a certain province consume? Which provinces have a shortage, and which have a surplus? What is the state of food imports and exports? How are agricultural products distributed? All of this requires collecting detailed statistics for observation. (2) Domestic agricultural, animal husbandry, aquatic products, and other stable food cultivation, breeding, processing, and manufacturing industries have made considerable progress. However, compared with foreign countries, how large is the difference? What are the shortcomings? It is also necessary to collect materials for practical research and theoretical discussions for social reference and to promote the improvement of various industries. (3) Food is an indispensable element of life. Knowledge about food, such as rice polishing methods, cooking skills, portion sizes, and nutritional value, should be comparatively studied to instill common sense in the people, increase national health, and improve family finances. (4) Domestic research materials on food are inevitably fragmented. Although there are many rich knowledge and academic studies that can be treasured,</p>
<p>Organization of the Preparatory Committee: (1) Organization: The central government will set up a preparatory committee to carry out the work, and the relevant government departments at home and abroad will assist and divide the work. Each department should also set up a special committee, and the detailed measures will be formulated separately. (2) Exhibits: All exhibits should be scientific so that visitors can obtain various knowledge and interests. (3) Funding: Assuming 500,000 yuan, the central government will allocate 300,000 yuan, and each province and city will share 5,000 yuan. The shortfall will be covered by admission fees, advertising fees, and merchandise display fees. (4) Preparation period: It is planned for one year.</p>
<p>Classification of Exhibits: Category 1: Food and Life Department. (Content:) Includes the relationship between life and food, body nutrition, dietary hygiene, etc. (Purpose:) To enlighten each person about the necessary knowledge of diet to enhance health care, infant care, and elderly care methods, and to promote society to choose nutritious, beneficial, and hygienic foods.

<h3 id="e166">The Printing Industry Suspended Operations Yesterday <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Union Director Wang Xingquan Arrested and Released</p>
<p>Due to the implementation of the Factory Law regulations, workers in the Shanghai printing industry, in order to comply with the law, suddenly and voluntarily switched to an eight-hour workday starting on August 1st. The Printing Industry Guild, finding it difficult to maintain operations, decided at a general meeting to temporarily suspend operations starting yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice of Suspension: The Printing Industry Guild notified all members the night before to suspend operations together, stating: "Regarding the notice, workers in this industry suddenly and voluntarily implemented an eight-hour workday on August 1st. This guild convened an emergency meeting of all members yesterday afternoon at 6 PM to discuss solutions. It was generally believed that the members of this guild have been repeatedly oppressed by the labor union and are unable to maintain operations. It was decided that all members will reluctantly suspend operations together this Monday and send representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau on Monday morning to preside over the matter and then resume operations. We must persevere to the end and take unified action. A meeting of members will be held at 2 PM on Monday afternoon to discuss solutions. Your presence is essential. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Labor and Management Petition: The Printing Industry Labor Union sent Xia Hailin and Wang Xingquan to the Social Affairs Bureau at 9 AM yesterday to petition, requesting: (1) Strictly order the employers to resume operations and restore the workers' jobs; (2) Punish the Printing Industry Guild, which instigated the suspension of operations; (3) Expedite the mediation of treatment conditions. The bureau director Zhang Shuye accepted the requests. The Printing Industry Guild also sent Zhu Kejun, Zhang Yixin, Wang Wenxian, Dai Zhonglin, and six others to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10 AM yesterday to petition, requesting: (1) Strictly prohibit the labor union from taking free action; (2) Restore the original nine-hour workday to maintain business difficulties. Bureau director Zhang Shuye also accepted the requests.</p>
<p>Director Arrested: After the guild announced the suspension of operations, more than 30 companies, including Meisheng, Liangyang, and Huayang, suspended operations together yesterday morning, and some, such as Dongxing Laoyishun, expelled workers. Upon learning of this, the Printing Industry Labor Union immediately sent standing committee members Xia Hailin and Wang Xingquan to persuade the workers to strictly observe order and not take extreme actions. At the same time, they demanded that the employers resume operations. When they arrived at Dongxing Printing on Beijing Road, they were reported to the police, resulting in the arrest of union director Wang Xingquan and taken to the Fuzhou Road police station. After questioning by the police chief, he was released because he had not disturbed public order.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The Printing Industry Guild held an emergency meeting of members at 2 PM yesterday. Chairman Zhu Kejun reported on the wishful process and the suspension of operations. The following resolutions were unanimously adopted on the spot: (1) If the workers do not restore the nine-hour workday, the industry will resolutely suspend operations together; (2) Continue to submit a statement to the Social Affairs Bureau explaining the hardship; (3) Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds requesting assistance; (4) An emergency meeting will be held at 7 PM at 4 PM.</p>
<p>Order from the Social Affairs Bureau: After receiving petitions from both labor and management in the printing industry yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau believed that it was inappropriate for the workers to voluntarily implement an eight-hour workday and that the employers' unauthorized suspension of operations was also rash. It strictly ordered both labor and management to resume work as usual within the stipulated time limit and await review.</p>
<p>Union Declaration: The Shanghai Printing Industry Labor Union declares on the illegal suspension of operations by employers: "All labor groups are aware that the labor-management contract of our union has been signed for nearly two years. According to government regulations, it can be amended after a full year. Our union is for labor-management cooperation, seeking its realization from theory. Although prices have increased and workers' lives are difficult, all workers can still serve with peace of mind. Their consideration for the employers' situation is not inconsiderable, and their commitment to the development of business is not insincere. This time, our union proposed to amend the contract based on the principle of reasonableness, and all the articles were approved by the Municipal Party Department. Our union immediately requested the employers to negotiate. The letter was sent seven times, but the employers ignored it. On August 3rd, the Printing Industry Guild convened a meeting of all members and ordered the industry to illegally suspend operations, expel all workers, seal the factory, and stop providing food and lodging, creating a disturbance. They also used the power of the concession to arrest innocent workers and imprison them. The various situations show that the guild intentionally oppresses the workers and destroys the labor movement, which is undeniable. However, in addition to making a final effort to deal with the employers' unreasonable oppression, we sincerely hope that all labor groups in the city will give sympathetic assistance. This is a declaration."</p>

<p>Two Accomplices Came Forward to Accuse Him</p>
<p>The Police Station Asks for a Special Re-Examination</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Shandong native who previously served as a Chinese detective at the General Inspection Office, was brought to the Special District Court in connection with the robbery of morphine from Fang Liansheng (also known as Xiao Liansheng Li Liansheng), but he was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, filed an appeal to the High Court, which ordered a retrial. All details have been reported previously. Fang Liansheng and Lu A-gen, Hu A-long, etc., kidnapped Chen Shi-fan on Pingwang Street on the evening of December 19th last year at around 9 PM, and kidnapped Li Hui-qing on Guangxi Road on the early morning of February 8th this year at around 1 AM, obtaining 7,000 yuan. After the case was discovered, they were brought to the Special Court for questioning. Lu A-gen was sentenced to death, Fang Liansheng was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Hu A-long was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Now, Lu and Fang have confessed that Liang Chengyu was actually the leader of the two kidnapping cases. The police station added the kidnapping charge against Liang in the Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen attended the third courtroom for questioning. According to the police station representative, lawyer Li Zhi-shan, who explained the case and said that the two witness prisoners, Lu A-gen and Fang Liansheng, had not yet arrived to testify, he requested an extension for a special re-examination. When Liang Chengyu was questioned, he claimed that he did not know Lu A-gen at all. He knew Fang Liansheng for about four or five months and often met him on South Chengdu Road, but they did not greet each other. I was promoted to detective at the police station for more than a year. He also hired lawyers Ye Fo-kang and Yuan Yang-an to briefly argue the case. Judge Xiao ruled that he should be remanded in custody and rescheduled for a special examination.</p>
<p>Using the Chairman's Name to Extort a Bribe</p>
<p>Received Several Contacts</p>
<p>Only Fang Yue-shan Was Caught</p>
<p>Zhang Zhi-xiang, a Ningbo native who owns the Jintai Customs Brokerage Firm at No. 91 Gongshun Lane, Guangdong Road, suddenly received a threatening letter on the 27th of last month, bearing the name of Chairman Wang Chong-fei, intending to extort 3,000 yuan in foreign currency. It instructed him to book a room at the Zhongnan Hotel on the afternoon of the 29th at 7:30 PM and have Director Fang come to negotiate, but the name Li Tian-sheng must be written on the door. Zhang immediately reported to the General Patrol House. The chief ordered Chinese detectives Geng De-biao, Bao detective Tian Jin-fu, Ma Wen-da, and Sun Ai-zhong to go to Room 205 of the Zhongnan Hotel to wait, but no representative from the gang arrived. They had to return to report. By the morning of the 31st, Zhang received another letter, asking him to negotiate at the entrance of the Xiaoshijie Second Bookstore at 7 PM. Zhang reported to the police again. Geng detective and others still went, and Tian detective acted as Zhang's representative. Before long, a Qingpu native named Fang Yue-shan came and invited Tian detective to the roof to talk. Tian immediately told him that Zhang's finances were not very good, so he could not obey the order and could only offer 500 yuan, but Fang refused, saying that he needed to ask for instructions from the chairman. He made an appointment to meet at the Far East Hotel the next day (August 1st). The name Li Tian-sheng still had to be written on the sign. Tian detective agreed. The next morning, two rooms, 503 and 504, were opened in the Far East Hotel to wait for Fang to come and be arrested. At 11 o'clock, they suddenly received a call from Fang, saying that the Far East Hotel was inconvenient and asked them to go to Xiaoshijie. The detectives went immediately and found Fang there. They immediately arrested him and took him back to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that there was an accomplice named Qi Zi-qing at No. 20 Shengyuan Road. The detectives went to arrest him but found no one. Yesterday morning, Fang was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Chief Judge Zhou Han-ting took the seat for questioning. According to the police station lawyer Ru Bao-yi, who explained the case and said that the case should be rescheduled for questioning after the interrogation, because the defendant had previously committed crimes such as robbery, theft, and carrying firearms, and had been sentenced to imprisonment by the court, it was necessary to investigate whether he had committed other crimes. When the defendant was questioned, he claimed that he was fooled by Qi. Judge Zhou then ordered a rescheduling of the interrogation.</p>
<p>The Nephew of Mr. Xue</p>
<h3 id="e171">Expands the Subject Matter of the Property Division <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>From 200,000 Yuan to 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Asks for Litigation Assistance for Court Costs</p>
<p>Since the death of Mr. Xue Bao-run, a giant of the dye business, he left behind a considerable amount of assets, causing his relatives and children to start disputes and endless lawsuits. Recently, Xue's nephews Hua Yi-gu and Hua Man-yun also requested to divide the inheritance of 200,000 yuan from Xue's wife, Sun. Because Hua and others were still minors, their guardian, Hua Li-hou, hired three lawyers, Ye Shao-ying, Yang Lin-zhi, and Zhang Jia-hui, to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First District of the Special Court. After a summons, the case was postponed to another date. Now, Hua Yi-gu and others have, the day before yesterday, entrusted their lawyers to file a statement expanding the subject matter of the lawsuit and requesting litigation assistance. The statement roughly stated: "As for the case of Yi-gu and others regarding the inheritance and division of the estate with Xue Sun and others, the subject matter of the lawsuit was temporarily set at 200,000 yuan because the estate could not be determined at that time. The petitioners have now learned that the property left by their late maternal grandfather, Mr. Xue Bao-run, such as shares and real estate, is of great value. Although there is no definite figure, according to the market price, it should be at least 3 million yuan. And various deposits are not included. According to one-sixth calculation, the petitioners should get at least 500,000 yuan. The court fees for this expanded subject matter are very high. The petitioners are still minors and have no ability to live. The legal guardian has recently lost his job. The last time he raised money for the petitioners to pay for the lawsuit, he was exhausted. Therefore, we ask the court to approve the expansion of the subject matter of the lawsuit to a total of 500,000 yuan, and to grant litigation assistance for the court costs for the expanded portion. As for the security deposit stipulated in Article 18 of the revised litigation fee rules, it should be added. The combination declaration is made." Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo of the Special Court attended the ninth civil court for questioning. The defendant Xue Sun's entrusted lawyers Lin Ying-qing and Wang You-ling appeared and stated that the plaintiff had houses and gardens in Xixi, Ximen, Wuxi, and had the ability to pay the court fees, and an investigation should be requested. Then Hua Li-hou said that there was indeed about one mu of real estate in Wuxi, but it was the property of his nephew and had been separated from the family. Judge Li checked the report and ordered that the case be rescheduled to be investigated and re-examined.</p>
<p>Chunjiang Wharf</p>
<h3 id="e172">Dispute Between Two Gangs of Workers <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Originated from the Struggle for Wharf Business</p>
<p>Fortunately, Strict Precautions Prevented Accidents</p>
<p>Along the Pudong Yanpu area, there are many ports and complex workers. The struggle for wharf business is often heard. Recently, for example, a case involving Hubei workers fighting over the foreman position at the Hongsheng Wharf has not yet been resolved. However, two gangs of workers at the Yongchang Wharf in Chunjiang Wharf, Lujiazui, have been plotting to seize the foreman position for days. Although the local military police have taken strict precautions, no violent incidents have occurred. However, the wharf has temporarily suspended operations, awaiting resolution from the superiors. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Report from the Shandong Gang: The Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report from Wang Zhao-qi, the foreman of the Shandong gang, the night before, stating that there is a machine room next to the Rihua Cotton Mill at Chunjiang Wharf, which was originally the property of the Best Times Foreign Firm, specializing in stacking cowhide and other goods. Later, it was purchased by the Hexing Company and leased to Yongchang Wharf to stack miscellaneous grains. It started business on the 31st of last month. The director of the wharf, Chai Kang-qin, hired Min as the foreman and established a guarantee, with a contract. However, at 2 PM on the 1st of this month, Min continued to lead more than 30 workers into the wharf to work. Unexpectedly, a Hubei man named Hu Lao-er brought more than 100 Hubei workers, with a fierce momentum. Without asking the reason, they drove the original workers out of the wharf and forcibly took over the work. Therefore, he reported to the wharf owner and temporarily suspended operations, requesting fairness to maintain labor movement.</p>
<p>The Barbarity of the Hubei Gang: District Chief Zhang, considering the matter related to local peace and order, sent a police officer to patrol in rotation every day to prevent fighting. On the one hand, he summoned the wharf owner Chai Kang-qin to inquire about the cause of the dispute. It was actually caused by the unreasonable behavior of Hu Lao-er, the Hubei foreman. Therefore, at 8 AM yesterday morning, he ordered the police to summon Hu for questioning.</p>
<p>Both Sides Transferred to the Headquarters: According to Hu, he is from Huangpi, Hubei, and has been a wharf foreman for many years. The wharf is located in the Chunjiang Wharf section, which is within his working range. Wang Zhao-qi's workplace is in the Lujiazui area and cannot allow him to overstep. When the district chief asked Hu what evidence he had, Hu was vague. It was decided to transfer both sides to the headquarters for disposal. The wharf remained closed yesterday, awaiting resolution from the superiors.</p>
<p>French Sailor</p>
<h3 id="e173">Fell into the Mingyuan Swimming Pool <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Died Suddenly from a Heart Attack</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that on Sunday, a French warship sailor, Gus, was at the edge of the Mingyuan Swimming Pool, preparing to jump in for a swim, when he collapsed into the pool, presumably due to heatstroke. He was rescued and sent to the hospital. After examination by a doctor, it was said that he died suddenly from a heart attack. No water was found in his lungs. It is reported that the Mingyuan Swimming Pool had even more visitors yesterday afternoon than on the opening night on Thursday. The pool was full of people. The park manager hired a team of lifeguards. When they saw someone who was not good at swimming venturing into the deep water, they immediately went to help. Gus was preparing to jump into the pool when he suddenly fell. The lifeguards immediately swam to rescue him. However, the place where he fell was 13 feet deep, and his body was tightly against the pool wall. After several difficulties, they were able to pull him up and carry him out of the pool, rushing him to the hospital. The body was then sent to the French authorities. It is heard that an autopsy will be performed on Monday.</p>

<p>The New York Eastern Bank in this city has compiled a table on the average prices of 20 important Shanghai stocks. The average price in January of this year was 24.20, and the average price on July 25 was 27.07, an increase of 2.97 points in seven months, accounting for more than 12 percent. The increase was especially large from January 22 to February 21, 1930, from 24.25 to 27.29. The highest in April reached 27.48. The sixth and seventh months also saw an upward trend. At that time, the market prices of exchanges in various countries were trending downward. This is all due to economic relations, so this table is very useful for merchants to refer to. Researchers of world events, after observing that the market prices of exchanges in various countries fell after the announcement of the US President Hoover's plan to suspend war debt payments, while the Shanghai market prices rose instead, this is also worth noting.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Grand Opening of the Sino-American Banking Corporation <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American Banking Corporation, located at No. 13 Guangdong Road, with abundant capital and comprehensive equipment, officially opened yesterday. Hundreds of Chinese and foreign political, business, academic, and other figures from Shanghai attended. Most of the celebrities and magnates attended. The company entertained them with champagne, refreshments, and other items, and the hospitality was attentive. The bustle lasted all day until dusk, when it finally subsided. It is heard that the company is large-scale, well-prepared, and the people in charge encourage each other with loyalty and credit. On that day, the total amount of fixed-term and current savings deposits and current deposits reached about one million, and there were more than 200 deposit and current accounts opened. It can be said to be grand.</p>
<p>Wusong District</p>
<h3 id="e176">Slight Reduction in Rickshaw and Small Cart Tax Rates <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Since the Wusong district was placed under the jurisdiction of this city, all vehicles should obtain municipal government licenses, and the vehicle tax should be collected by the municipal government, consistent with other districts. It is understood that the Finance and Public Works Bureaus, considering that the Wusong market is not yet fully developed, took this into account when formulating the tax rates. However, given that Wusong is also within the municipal area, consistent tax collection is appropriate to avoid discrimination. Furthermore, Wusong is adjacent to the northern districts of the city, and vehicles that have paid the tax can operate in the southern and northern parts of the city. Considering that the number of rickshaws in the southern and northern parts of the city is already at its limit, without any further increases allowed, Wusong rickshaws have the opportunity to operate throughout the city, which is not without benefit. Therefore, it was submitted to the municipal government for approval to collect taxes at the same rate as the southern and northern parts of the city. Now, Wusong rickshaw and small cart pullers, citing that the tax rate is too high and unbearable, have petitioned for a reduction, requesting to operate only within the Wusong district, and are generally unwilling to register. Mr. Shen Risheng, a standing committee member of the Sixth District Party Department, on the one hand, advised the rickshaw companies, and on the other hand, went to the Public Works and Finance Bureaus to represent the cart pullers. The Public Works and Finance Bureaus jointly discussed the matter. As a result, considering the aforementioned situation of the rickshaw and small cart pullers in the district, it was deemed that the tax rate could be appropriately reduced. It was decided that the tax rates for rickshaws and small carts in the district would be temporarily reduced by 50%. In the future, when the central urban area becomes prosperous and there is a considerable need, the full tax will be collected again. However, during the period of reduced tax collection, the business scope of these vehicles will be limited to the Wusong district. The above plan will be implemented after being submitted to the municipal government for approval and then publicly announced.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Language School Preparations Completed <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Language Institute at 127 Avenue du Roi Albert, founded by Zhou Xiansheng, Xu Peihuang, Xu Chusheng, and more than ten others, is divided into six departments: Chinese, English, German, French, Russian, and Japanese. The Chinese department is specifically set up for foreigners. Each department is divided into three levels, with a flexible curriculum. Students must complete 120 to 150 credits to graduate. The entrance examination is scheduled for August 15, and classes will begin on September 1. There is a large number of applicants. The close ties of modern international relations have made people in academic and business circles feel the importance of foreign languages. Due to the lack of talent and funding, a school specializing in training in various languages to facilitate international cultural exchange, although long desired by the Chinese people, has not yet been established. Therefore, the establishment of this school is truly the beginning of Chinese language schools.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Two Apprentices Bewitched by Novels <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Leaving a Message Saying They Are Going to a Deep Mountain to Cultivate Taoism</p>
<p>Novels Mislead People to Such an Extent</p>
<p>The Yongtai Xiang Department Store, located at the corner of West Xinqiao Street on Rue de Consulat in the French Concession, is large in scale and has a decent business. It employs more than thirty clerks and apprentices. Among them are two apprentices: Zhang Wenhua from Kunshan, who is twenty years old, and Lin Zhengting from Ningbo, who is eighteen years old. The two apprentices are quite close. Every evening after closing, when they go upstairs to sleep, they each bring a copy of the latest popular martial arts novel, becoming so addicted to reading that they often talk to their colleagues about wanting to learn the art of flying through the air and serving the country after attaining enlightenment. Their colleagues initially did not suspect anything. However, the day before yesterday, the two apprentices suddenly left at the same time and did not return even late at night. The manager sent people out to search for them everywhere but could not find them. They searched through the items left behind by the two apprentices and found a letter stating that they were going to a deep mountain to cultivate Taoism. The store, concluding that the two apprentices were undoubtedly bewitched by martial arts novels, immediately sent letters to their respective guarantors, informing their families to come to Shanghai to find them, and also reported the matter to the local police station, requesting them to investigate the whereabouts of Zhang and Lin.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Worker Holds Grudge and Kills Foreman <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Surrenders to the Police Station After the Incident</p>
<p>Jin Niangen, also known as Jin Yigen, a 32-year-old local foreman at the Yangshupu Water Plant, was the director of the paint department and lived at 1089 Pingliang Road. He also owned the Jin Yongchang Paint Shop. Shen Dongsheng, a local worker in the factory, had previously asked Jin for leave to go to Wuxi to recuperate. Later, due to financial difficulties, he sent a letter asking Jin to arrange for money from the factory, which was unsuccessful. In anger, he came to Shanghai around 6:00 AM on the 1st of this month, bought a sharp knife, and waited on Taopeng Road. He stabbed Jin three times in the waist and back. Jin, in pain, ran home. A Chinese police officer, No. 3790, patrolling the street, heard the alarm and sent Jin to Tongren Hospital, where he died despite treatment. The body was taken to the Fielun Road morgue by Chinese detective Zhang Jiaxuan from the Yangshupu Police Station. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. He took his seat and, according to Jin Jiangshi, the wife of the deceased, her husband Jin Yigen had been working at the water plant for nine years. The defendant had come before and asked her husband to report to the factory, falsely claiming that he had died of illness, so that the foreigners would give him 200 yuan in compensation. Her husband refused, and the defendant committed this heinous act. At the time, her husband was injured and ran home in pain, covered in blood, saying that he had been stabbed by the defendant with a knife. He was taken to the hospital but died despite treatment. She requested an investigation. The defendant surrendered to the Yangshupu Police Station after the incident. When questioned, he confessed that he had asked for leave due to illness and then asked the deceased to withdraw his savings from the factory. He said that his position had been suspended by the foreigners because he had taken too much sick leave, and he refused to help him in any other way. He was so angry that he bought a knife, waited there, and stabbed him, only intending to vent his anger and not to kill him. He surrendered to the police station afterward. Mr. Guo verified the confession and examined the body, confirming that Jin Yigen had been stabbed to death. The murderer, Shen Liansheng, has been prosecuted by the police station and should be sent to the court for review. The body was handed over to the deceased's wife, Jin Jiangshi, for coffin burial.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Kunshan Kidnapper Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Xia Xiaomazi, Sixteen Years Old</p>
<p>Pan Mingshou, a detective from the Kunshan County Government, reported to the French police a few days ago that a kidnapper named Xia Xiaomazi had conspired with accomplices in Kunshan to kidnap someone and extort a large sum of money. After the arrest of accomplices such as Zhou Er Mazi, they confessed that their accomplice Xia Xiaomazi had fled to Shanghai and was hiding in Qiaxing Lane on Xujiahui Road. He requested cooperation in the arrest. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered the detective to cooperate in arresting Xia and bringing him to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought to the Second Court of the Special District, where Judge Luo Renji took his seat in the criminal court. First, Fei Xizhen, the attorney representing the police station, presented the case, followed by the detective who filed the case, requesting permission to transfer him. When questioned, Xia Xiaomazi confessed that he was from Jiangbei and was sixteen years old. He denied being a thief. Judge Luo ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Ren Zhennan's Wife Files for Legal Separation <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Requesting 120 Yuan Per Month for Living Expenses</p>
<p>The case in which Ren Jiangshi, the wife of lawyer Ren Zhennan, filed a criminal complaint with the District Court Prosecutor's Office against Ren Zhennan for insult and injury has been dismissed. Now, Ren Jiangshi has again hired lawyer Tao Jiachun to file a petition with the Mediation Office of the District Court for legal separation. Her statement roughly states that due to unbearable abuse, she requests that the court order a legal separation to protect her life. Ms. Ren was born after her father had passed away, leaving her without uncles or brothers. She and her mother relied on her mother's income as a worker to raise her. When she was thirteen years old, her mother arranged for her to marry Ren Zhennan through a matchmaker. Later, Ren Zhennan studied in France, became accustomed to European ways, and became arrogant, extravagant, and licentious, looking down on everyone. When he returned to China, Ms. Ren's family proposed the marriage, but he disliked them for being poor and had someone else he liked, intending to break off the engagement. His father did not allow it, so they reluctantly held the wedding ceremony on May 10 at the Yangjingbang Catholic Church. Because Ren Zhennan's wish was not fulfilled, he harbored resentment. When Ms. Ren's mother went to visit, he thought that because she was working as a servant, her clothes were shabby, and she was his mother-in-law, it was a disgrace to his qualifications as a student who had studied abroad and his status as a lawyer who could afford to ride in a car. Therefore, he abused Ms. Ren even more, forcing her to divorce. Although Ms. Ren's family was poor, she had studied at Chongde Girls' School for several years, believed in Catholicism, and knew some etiquette, so she tolerated it without complaint. However, he became more and more extreme, and everything that people would not do, he did. He was violent, tyrannical, and more fierce than a beast. Ms. Ren realized that if she did not seek help, she would die. Therefore, she went back to her mother's house to live temporarily and filed a complaint with the Prosecutor's Office for injury and legal action to warn the wicked and hope for reform. Unexpectedly, the Prosecutor's Office did not handle the injury case. In addition to requesting a review according to law, the marital relationship was already so bad, and the cruel behavior had not been dealt with according to law. Then his ferocity would be even greater. If she went back, the abuse would be even worse. As a weak woman, how could she protect her life? After thinking it over again and again, she had no choice but to file a petition, weeping and begging the court to investigate, pity her weakness, uphold justice, and provide legal assistance, ordering him to pay living expenses every month, so that she could live with her mother and protect her life. Then not only would Ms. Ren and her mother be eternally grateful, but her late father would also be grateful in the afterlife. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Bingxin specially opened the Eighth Court for hearing. Ren Zhennan did not appear, only the petitioner Ren Jiangshi and lawyer Tao Jiachun appeared in court. Ms. Ren Jiangshi testified that she was 21 years old, from Ningbo, and lived in her mother's house at No. 11 Dafang Lane, Xiaobeimen. She also stated the previous situation and requested that the legal separation be granted. Lawyer Tao then stated that the petitioner and the defendant were formally married. There was a case in the Prosecutor's Office, and the newspapers reported the criminal part in detail. The pain suffered by the petitioner was difficult to speak about. This time, the petitioner came to our law firm to cry and complain about the past. Our lawyer saw that she was very bitter, so he went to find the defendant's attorneys, Jin Yu, Xue Jiaqi, etc. (because Ren had another case in court and hired lawyers Jin and Xue to represent him) to discuss a mediation plan. They said that Ren did not agree to mediation and was willing to go to court. However, the petitioner's mother was working as a servant and her life was very hard. Therefore, the petitioner requested that living expenses be granted and still intended to study, hoping that the defendant would one day change his mind and the couple would reconcile. Now, she intends to request living expenses of 120 yuan per month (including 30 yuan for rent, 30 yuan for food, 20 yuan for pocket money, 20 yuan for buying clothes, and 20 yuan for education). Considering the defendant's status as a student who had studied in France, a lawyer, and the ability to ride in a car, the request for 120 yuan per month was not excessive. The defendant, as a lawyer, should know the law. He should have appeared in court when summoned. He should be punished for resisting the summons. Now, he requested that the court issue another summons for the defendant to appear in court so that mediation could be facilitated. The judge approved the request and waited for the clerk to issue another summons. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Zhou Miao Clan: Zhou Miao Clan, a 44-year-old widow from Ningbo, lived at 735 Yangshupu Road. Due to being unable to repay her debts, she became disillusioned with the world. Suddenly, around 4:00 PM yesterday, she hanged herself in her house. After being discovered by her family, they immediately reported it to the Yangshupu Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese police officer No. 2529 to take her to Tongren Hospital. Because it was impossible to save her, she died immediately. Her body was transferred to the morgue to await examination.</p>
<p>Ye Sheng: Ye Sheng, a 22-year-old man from Ningbo, went to visit the prostitute Wu Laosan at 1232 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, the night before last. He suddenly fainted. He was rushed to the hospital, where it was found to be an opium overdose. He was transferred to Renji Hospital. At that time, it was already 8:00 AM yesterday. He died in the hospital around 10:00 AM. The deceased was only 22 years old. It is said that he came to Shanghai from Ningbo in February and met Wu Laosan at Tianyunlou on Nanjing Road, forming an inseparable bond. Later, as his money ran out, Wu became increasingly cold towards him. In anger and resentment, he decided to die.</p>

<h3 id="e186">A Glimpse of the Third Year of the Child Welfare Association <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Weide, the director-general of the Child Welfare Association, announced the general situation of the association's work in the third year and stated that the association's policy would undergo major changes in the future. According to him:</p>
<p>Policy Change: At the beginning of the association's establishment, all kinds of affairs started from the relief end. After discussion by the executive committee, it was generally believed that the association's work should cover the whole country. Its nature is universal, not local; national, not regional; educational, not relief. In the future, it is necessary to unite comrades across the country, think from the root, and carry out large-scale publicity, so as to awaken the people across the country and jointly promote progress.</p>
<p>Registration Completed: On May 24 last year, the association was issued Certificate No. 1 of the Ci character by the Shanghai Municipal Party Department's People's Training Committee. On September 25, an order for sound organization and training was issued. Subsequently, it was registered with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. On September 30, Certificate No. 3 of the Shan character was issued, and a wooden seal of Shan character No. 48 was issued. The registration procedures can be said to be complete.</p>
<p>Organizing Branches: This spring, the association received letters from enthusiastic child welfare advocates in Nanjing, Beiping, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Hankou, etc., inquiring about the organization of child welfare branches. According to the association's charter, there are only provisions for branch offices. With the approval of the Bureau of Social Affairs, the word "branch" was added to the charter. The outline of the branch organization was also formulated and submitted to the Executive Committee for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Child Protection: The association's organization is divided into five departments. The Child Protection Department handled 72 cases of child abuse in this year, of which 62 were investigated on-site and 10 were investigated by correspondence. The methods of handling included taking abused children into the association's care, sending them to relief homes, returning them to their guardians, and filing lawsuits on their behalf, requesting the court to punish the parties involved. All decisions were made according to the circumstances at the time. A plan to release Shanghai's young prostitutes is now being drawn up and will be carried out in cooperation with the Women and Children Relief Association to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Child Education: The association is affiliated with the Ciyou Education Institute, whose purpose is to enable children without families to have a good relationship with families without children. On the one hand, it tries to adopt them, and on the other hand, it allows people to take them away, so that orphaned children can each have a place to live. In this year, a total of 67 children were adopted and 40 children were sent for adoption. There are still 27 children remaining. On May 16 of this year, the institute held a wedding ceremony for a female student, Sun Fengzhi. Dr. Luo Yunyan, vice president of the association, presided over the wedding, and Hu Yigu, judge of the Jiangsu Higher Court, served as the wedding witness. The Social Security Bureau also sent representatives to supervise the wedding. The ceremony was quite grand.</p>
<p>Child Health: The association has two Ciyou medical clinics in Zhabei and Yangshupu. In this year, a total of 21,082 sick children were cured. In June last year, a health campaign was held in Zhabei. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people participated in the opening ceremony, more than 1,000 people joined the lantern parade, and about 40,000 people visited the exhibition and movies. In June of this year, children's health campaigns were held successively in Zhabei and Yangshupu. It is estimated that more than 5,000 people participated in the opening ceremony, 4,000 people participated in the lantern parade, and about 80,000 people visited the exhibition and movies.</p>
<p>Child Research: In April of this year, the association founded a Ciyou Garden in Yangshupu to study the physiological and psychological needs of children. Most of the children admitted are children of workers, limited to two to four years old. Every morning, when workers go to work, they send their children to the garden. The garden provides lunch and appropriate education. In the afternoon, when workers get off work, they take them back. Currently, Professor Chen Heqin, director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is the honorary director, Mrs. Haimu Hua is the honorary director, and Mrs. Wang Guanyi is the full-time teacher. The management is quite perfect.</p>
<p>Social Education: The Ciyou Monthly, published by the association, was registered with the Ministry of Internal Affairs in April of this year. It has now been published in Volume 2, Issue 3. It is still edited by Mr. Chen Zhengfan. The content is quite substantial and wonderful. The association also published three types of Ciyou series of books: (1) How to Teach Children (written by Professor Chen Heqin), (2) Sparrow and Family Education (written by Chen Zhengfan), (3) Creating a Good Environment for Children (written by Professor Chen Heqin), which are widely sold. Other publications, such as Children's Education Pictures, Children's Song Collections, and Children's Story Collections, are also very popular in society. The association also promoted the meaning and importance of Children's Day. People from all walks of life responded enthusiastically. The National Government has now officially stipulated that April 4 is China's Children's Day, and the Ministry of Education has formulated commemorative measures, which must be implemented nationwide every year.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau and the Harbor Quarantine Office will jointly inspect ships arriving from Ningbo and provide passengers with free vaccinations, effective from August 1. Yesterday morning, at 3:00 AM, the Xin Beijing and Ningshao ships arriving from Ningbo arrived at Sanjia Water outside the Wusongkou. Three quarantine officers boarded each ship to carry out quarantine and provide free vaccinations. Director Hu of the Municipal Health Bureau also went to Wusong at night to give instructions. To take care of the convenience of merchants and travelers, the ships were allowed to proceed as usual after the quarantine officers boarded. The shipowners knew that quarantine was to protect public health and was a common practice in civilized commercial ports, so they led the crew to assist in the process. Passengers also welcomed the free vaccinations. It is estimated that more than 500 people were vaccinated on the Ningshao ship and more than 900 people were vaccinated on the Xin Beijing ship. Half an hour before the ship arrived at the dock, the quarantine and vaccinations on each ship had been completed. The process was very rapid and convenient for the shipping industry and travelers. This was because the Municipal Health Bureau and the Harbor Quarantine Office had made meticulous considerations in advance on both epidemic prevention and convenience for merchants and travelers, so the process went smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Tragic Disaster in Tanghe and Other Counties in Henan <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Report from the Jisheng Society</p>
<p>According to a report from the Henan Province Tanghe County Bandit Disaster Relief Association to the China Jisheng Society, Tanghe County has been plagued by disasters since the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. The city was first captured by the bandit Li, then by the Red Bandits, and then by the bandit Cui. On May 30th, at dawn, Cui's bandits, with approximately 10,000 men and guns and over 1,000 horses, broke into the city and occupied it for 18 days. They disturbed an area over a hundred miles away, and all men, women, old and young were bound. Rich and poor alike were tied up. Demands for money impoverished families, and extortions left them destitute. Any delay resulted in torture and whipping, and those who exceeded the deadline were immediately beheaded. The number of people having their noses, ears, fingers, and feet cut off daily was in the hundreds. Nineteen out of ten houses in the city were burned, and all clothing and belongings were swept clean. Everywhere they dug and scraped, truly stripping the land bare. The population was reduced by more than half, and no family was spared, not even the chickens and dogs. Not a single pot or stove remained in any home. The streets were filled with the heads and tails of pigs and sheep, and the sights were filled with the corpses of the dead. The chaos of Li Zicheng's rebellion was nothing compared to this. In the countryside, nearly a hundred miles from the county seat, there were almost no traces of civilians. The wheat that was about to be harvested was abandoned in the fields. The remaining grain was burned. All the villages were burned, and the population was dragged away. There were no livestock in the fields, and the villages were reduced to scorched earth. The wells and ruins were desolate, and the four suburban areas were barren. Starving people lined the roads, and it was difficult to avoid death. More than 20,000 people were taken away as hostages, and the loss of property exceeded tens of thousands. On July 11th, they were again hit by torrential rains. The Tang, Tong, and Bi rivers simultaneously swelled, flooding areas of more than ten miles east to west and more than a hundred miles north to south. Aside from those who died at the hands of bandits, many also drowned. The survivors do not know how to live out their remaining days. They are appealing for rescue, unable to wait any longer. It is reported that in Henan Province, Xinyang, Guangshan, Luoshan, Gushi, Shangcheng, Yexian, Dengxian, Nantai, Tongbai, Nanyang, Songxian, Yiyang, Menyang, Wuyang, Lushi, Xinye, Xinan, Zhechuan, Yancheng, Qixian, and other counties have suffered from banditry or natural disasters, or both. Dozens of counties have reported, and who knows how many have not yet reported. With such a major catastrophe looming, the displaced people have nowhere to flee. It is impossible to save everyone. The misery is unbearable. It is hoped that our charitable comrades can do their best to save as many lives as possible, as this is the greatest merit. Saving others is saving oneself, and helping others is creating blessings. Let all comrades pay attention to this. The natural disaster is so great, and the man-made disaster is so cruel. Those with a heart who read this report will surely be moved and unable to remain indifferent.</p>

Moreover, the pills are numerous, large, and inexpensive, so its sales have been quite prosperous in recent years. Recently, due to the anti-Japanese movement, people across the country are enthusiastically boycotting Japanese goods, so sales of Mintan have been increasing dramatically. Even companies from Japan and other foreign ports, as well as foreign sundry goods stores and tobacco shops, are actively seeking wholesale purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e215">A Brief Discussion of Nietzsche's Philosophy of the Superman <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yang</p>
<p>Written by Li Shicen, Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to see a newly published book by Mr. Li Shicen at the Commercial Press, "A Brief Discussion of Nietzsche's Philosophy of the Superman," which made me very happy. Books on the study of Nietzsche's thought are almost non-existent in China (except for short introductory articles). Mr. Li Shicen is known for introducing Nietzsche's ideas, and I heard that he recently spent a long time studying in Germany. How appropriate and insightful it is for him to write this book! After buying it and returning home, I happily read it in one breath. Although it is a small booklet of less than a hundred pages (ninety-four pages), I feel that it allows one to glimpse the general ideas of the outstanding and extraordinary philosopher of the Superman, giving our aging nation a shot in the arm. Therefore, I cannot help but introduce it.</p>
<p>Why does the author want to introduce the thought of this philosopher of the Superman? We see these words on the first page of the introduction:</p>
<p>The reason why I am so eager to introduce Nietzsche's thought is complex, but generally speaking, it can be divided into several points:</p>
<p>(1) Nietzsche's meaning in creating the philosophy of the Superman is because all of humanity is too weak, too cheap, too idealistic, and too greedy for ease. I wish to introduce the philosophy of the Superman because China is too weak, too cheap, too idealistic, and too greedy for ease...</p>
<p>(2) The biggest weakness of the Chinese nation is its compromising and lukewarm nature. On the surface, this seems like moderation and peace, but in reality, it is just the exposure of the inferior nature of hypocrites and slaves. This nature has been passed down for a long time, and it is not easy to awaken without a great stimulus and thorough awakening. This is my second reason for introducing Nietzsche's thought.</p>
<p>(3) Nietzsche's philosophy is a philosophy of resistance, a philosophy of anti-values. Nietzsche called for "a re-evaluation of all values." But Nietzsche's target of resistance is the cannibalistic Christianity. This book, however, wants to attack the cannibalistic rites and customs...</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese nation does not outwardly believe in any religion, but in its bones it believes in polytheism... Nietzsche shouts out, "It is permissible to blaspheme, because God is already dead." What a powerful proverb! Without breaking the idea of polytheism, the authority of science cannot be exerted. This is my fourth reason for introducing Nietzsche's thought.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's thought has been cursed a lot after the European War, believing that it can promote war. These are all exaggerated remarks. In China, we should not think like this, but should sincerely welcome this lofty and great thought in order to revive the declining and rise up from the ruins.</p>
<p>The structure of the whole book is divided into the following chapters: (1) Introduction, (2) A Short Biography of Nietzsche, (3) The Development Process of Nietzsche's Thought, (4) Nietzsche and Stirner, (5) Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, (6) Nietzsche's View of Life, (7) Nietzsche's View of the Universe, (8) Nietzsche's View of Values, (9) Nietzsche's View of Evolution, (10) Nietzsche's View of Morality, (11) Nietzsche's View of Art, (12) Conclusion. This is very natural and comprehensive. Please add a brief explanation below:</p>
<p>In "A Short Biography of Nietzsche," the life of this philosopher of the Superman is narrated purely from the perspective of simple thought, and it concludes that "Nietzsche's egoism did not come from suffering, loneliness, and depression, but from the essence of his personality. From the essence of his personality came his 'truth' and 'greatness'." The author is truly a confidant of Nietzsche. In "The Development Process of Nietzsche's Thought," the evolutionary principle believed by Nietzsche—that by the age of thirty, one must replay the evolutionary process of mankind from the first ancestor to modern man over three thousand years—is used to explain the development of Nietzsche's own thought, and Nietzsche's works are used as evidence. The first period is represented by "The Birth of Tragedy" and "Untimely Meditations," the second period is represented by "Human, All Too Human" and "Dawn," and the third period is represented by "The Gay Science," Thus Spoke Zarathustra, "Beyond Good and Evil," "On the Genealogy of Morality," "The Case of Wagner," "Twilight of the Idols," "Nietzsche contra Wagner," "The Antichrist," and "Ecce Homo." This is a systematic arrangement. Then, these works are further explained, and it is concluded that "the first period is the Romantic period, the second period is the Naturalistic period, and the third period is the Neo-Romantic period." The third period is considered the most important, but the first and second periods should not be ignored. This chapter clearly explains the complicated developmental process of the Superman philosopher’s thought effortlessly, which is a pleasant thing for the reader.</p>
<p>The two chapters "Nietzsche and Stirner" and "Nietzsche and Schopenhauer" explain that Schopenhauer was the starting point for guiding Nietzsche's philosophy, and Stirner guided the entirety of Nietzsche's philosophy. Stirner discovered that "the only thing that truly exists in the universe is my self." Nietzsche then accepted Stirner's proposition and achieved his philosophy of the Superman. Nietzsche inherited Schopenhauer's will theory and further expanded it, transforming Schopenhauer's will to live into the will to power. These two chapters explain the relationship between Nietzsche and the thoughts of these two men, conducting a tracing of the roots and origins of Nietzsche's theory.</p>
<p>From the sixth to the eleventh chapters, these are the central points of the book. The narration of "Nietzsche's View of Life" uses the book "The Birth of Tragedy" as its basis, recognizing this book as the crystallization of (1) classical philology, (2) Schopenhauer's philosophy of will, and (3) the influence of Wagner's music. From classical philology, one obtains the two spiritual trends of Greece—with the god of beauty and the god of wine representing these two spirits, evolving into the world of static beauty and the world of will—Schopenhauer's philosophy of will inspires the thought of the will to power, and Wagner's music promotes artistic taste. From these three influences, Nietzsche's view of life is achieved—the first essential of life is to take a challenging attitude towards life, and to exchange the greatest pain for a noble life. The end of this chapter further uses Nietzsche's view of life to criticize the Chinese view of life. Speaking of "Nietzsche's View of the Universe," it first narrates Nietzsche's use of sharp and courageous eyes to break all "realistic thoughts" (the essence of the universe) that originate from illusion worship, and then builds his own "eternal recurrence theory," saying that the truth of the universe is inevitable, decided, fatalistic, and blind. Nietzsche's focus is on making the universe extremely stale and meaningless, and then the Superman will pull it back with one hand, reviving the stale and enriching the meaningless, so the Superman is valuable in fighting against the god of death, fighting against fate, and making a struggle against eternal recurrence.</p>
<p>In "Nietzsche's View of Values," the Superman philosophy published in his masterpiece "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" is explained. He only values the earth and not heaven, only values the flesh and not the spirit, re-evaluating the standard of value, believing that whatever makes "life" more beautiful is good, otherwise it is evil; whatever makes "life" stronger is good, otherwise it is evil; whatever makes "life" full and expanded is good, otherwise it is evil. Using such thoughts to criticize the Chinese people's values is indeed completely useless. "Nietzsche's View of Evolution" explains that his observations are similar to Darwin's—that mankind can evolve into the Superman, but there are two major boundaries. Darwin believes that life is a struggle for survival, while Nietzsche believes that life has a competition beyond survival. Darwin emphasizes external forces, taking the environment as the reason for evolution, while Nietzsche emphasizes internal forces, taking the will to power as the reason for evolution. This is a very powerful explanation.</p>
<p>In the chapter "Nietzsche's View of Morality," based on his book "Beyond Good and Evil," morality is divided into two categories: (1) the morality of great men, and (2) the morality of slaves. The so-called morality of great men is the morality of actively affirming the self, satisfying instincts, and possessing the highest value. On the contrary, the morality of slaves is the morality of merely using the power of the majority, the revelation of God, the authority of the state, and the legends of society to oppress the strong and great, making mankind fall into decay and corruption day by day, which is a morality of absolutely no value. The morality of great men is the "morality of war," and the so-called war is for mankind, for life, and for the Superman. This is the standard of the morality of war. Nietzsche further divides the process of war into three types: (1) from spirit to camel, (2) from camel to lion, and (3) from lion to child. Therefore, the morality of war also possesses these three spirits. Finally, "Nietzsche's View of Art" explains that Nietzsche particularly values the art of living, as well as the essence of art that he discovered, and the indispensable elements of artists. These two chapters both use Nietzsche's thought to criticize the Chinese people's moral concepts and artistic concepts.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the whole book makes a simple comparison of the three famous individualists of the nineteenth century, Nietzsche, Stirner, and Kierkegaard, in order to elucidate the true meaning of individualism. The author even loudly proclaims:</p>
<p>"When Chinese people hear the term 'individualism,' they will immediately associate it with selfishness, thinking that it is an ominous thing. Little do they know that the main purpose of individualism is to actively affirm the self, affirm the self's personality, and affirm the self's life. Self-affirmation makes the whole world affirm, and one will realize that one should have a responsibility to the world, and one should also have a responsibility to oneself."</p>
<p>The above has introduced a general outline of the book "A Brief Discussion of Nietzsche's Philosophy of the Superman." When reading this book, one can only feel that the introduction is extremely systematic, the explanation is extremely thorough, and the sharpness of the writing and the richness of the vocabulary are like the author's attitude when he is lecturing on the podium, making people forget their weariness. In the important chapters of this book, the author always concludes by using Nietzsche's thought to criticize the traditional concepts of the Chinese people. When reading, one can only feel that it hits the nail on the head and is extremely enjoyable. The Chinese nation has entered a state of aging and decline today. The transformation of human nature is even more important than all transformations. To transform human nature, one cannot but inject this forceful shot in the arm from Nietzsche. The author, borrowing Nietzsche's tone, said:</p>
<p>"If you do not believe that the truth that Nietzsche preaches is true, then you youths who are not awakened have no reason to exist!"</p>
<p>Are the readers moved? Please take the time to savor this book.</p>

<p>— Jun Shan</p>
<p>The periscope used in submarines to view the sea surface, and by soldiers in trenches to view outside the trench, is now very popular in the United States. It is just that the application has changed from military to entertainment. An inventor who is good at speculation has made many miniature periscopes, beautifully decorated, and specializes in selling them to a group of people who love to watch sports games. With one of these in hand, you don't have to squeeze to the front to see the details of the game. Just leisurely wait behind people, hold up the periscope to look, and naturally you won't miss any of the excitement of the game. This is good news for short spectators!</p>
<h3 id="e218">At the Hospital <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Fan</p>
<p>On Saturday (June 27th) at 9:10 am, because of my friend Kai Jun's illness, I stepped into the door of a hospital by the Wusong seaside. The first impression we got was a registration clerk who looked neither like a winter melon nor a short pumpkin. It was time to register, but he was busy with his own work. After several questions, he began to do what he should have done.</p>
<p>The unlucky person (patient) is really haunted by ghosts. Coincidentally, the Dean Yi Ye (I know this from their title), with a Rock cigarette holder in his mouth, swaggered in. When he got to the door, he said, "You (pointing to the registration clerk) make a phone call for me to the arsenal to ask Mr. Wang (forgive me for not hearing clearly) whether the business he introduced to me is going to happen." In this way, the Dean's phone call was naturally a victory, and the patient's registration was naturally a failure. The phone call back said that the business was available, and there was even a house call, but the time could be arranged. Who knew that our hospital's Dean, upon hearing the words "house call," without asking about the time, immediately put on a smiling face and went to the Dean's office to change clothes.</p>
<p>This Dean's office is opposite the registration desk. On the wall hangs a sign with the three characters (Dean's Office). In addition, it is a transparent glass window, so you can see it so clearly. By the time the Dean had changed his clothes, there were more than twenty patients registering for surgery, but they were all workers. There was only my friend Kai Jun registering for internal medicine. As a result, when the Dean went on a house call, he took five minutes (at most) to diagnose my friend Kai Jun alone, which made me unable to help but be grateful. However, in the diagnosis, he hastily wrote two vague words that I couldn't tell whether they were English or German, and then added a question mark at the end, which made me unable to avoid suspicion, because I was anxious to know what illness my friend had, I could not help but ask:</p>
<p>"Dean, what exactly is his illness?"</p>
<p>Not only did he not answer, but he didn't even look at me, and went on the house call with his female nurse, sitting in two rickshaws.</p>
<p>The next day, Kai Jun's illness worsened. For the sake of my friend's illness, I had no choice but to swallow my anger and still ran to the hospital where I had been snubbed to inquire about the rules for hospitalization. Just in time, I met the very imposing Dean from yesterday, forcing me to call out:</p>
<p>"Dean, does your hospital have any quieter rooms?" (referring to the four-person rooms).</p>
<p>But he replied with a sarcastic and angry tone, "We can't build another house just for your friend here."</p>
<p>I thought he was really strange. He hadn't even answered whether there were any rooms yet, and he treated people with this kind of attitude. I was just about to retort, but he left. For the sake of my friend's illness, I had no choice but to return to school.</p>
<p>Here comes another snag. No. 8 Li Family Residence is home to someone surnamed Wang. He is my friend, one could say my best friend. He has a special temper and doesn't like to socialize with people. Sometimes, he is even too lazy to talk to people. At the same time, he also has a different kind of malaria. When this disease doesn't break out, it doesn't break out, but when it does, he faints. Not only can he not speak, but he can only move his hands and feet slightly. The appearance of his eyes is dull, looking like someone who is about to die, except that his breathing is different.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, because of an inadvertent mistake, he brought on his old illness that had not broken out for several years. The situation was no different from what I described earlier, so the people living with him were terrified. They wanted to send him to the hospital, but they were afraid that if something unfortunate happened, no one would be responsible. If they didn't send him to the hospital, they would be guilty of conscience for not saving someone who was about to die. It was really difficult to decide. After hesitating for a while, they finally came to call me. When I saw that kind of situation, I only advocated sending him to the hospital. However, besides that hospital, there was no other epidemic hospital to be found. As the saying goes, "When people reach the edge of a cliff, who dares not to bow their heads?" This is my actual situation. When I arrived at that hospital, it just so happened that they were eating. It was truly bad timing and an unfortunate fate. Although the registration was a special registration, the result was exactly the opposite. People with acute illnesses certainly don't feel it, but people with clear minds standing in the open air waiting for half an hour is really unbearable. I don't think eating a home-cooked meal is necessarily more urgent than diagnosing an acute illness.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
