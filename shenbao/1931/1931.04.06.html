<p>國家不能戰勝於外。其結果必生内訌。觀於歐戰時之末期。各國類多革命者。即其證也。惟政黨亦然。多數政黨之國家。其有力之政黨。其政權或爲沧黨所推。倒或不能推倒他黨而恢復政權。其結果。亦必易内訌。即如現在各國之有力政黨而論。英國之保守黨。不能制勝政府黨。而黨中有力之邱吉爾。遂辭黨部中之財政委員。以示與魁包爾温之意見不同。日本之政友會不能制勝政府黨。遂有改變其黨内組織之運動。德國之國家社會黨亦然。所謂衝鋒隊者。不得行其志。遂有分裂之舉。凡此之類。各國失意之政黨。莫不有此狀况也。蓋各國之有政黨。其本意原欲取政權以推行其黨之政策故黨之政策不能行。寗舍棄政權以讓敵黨今則其義稍忘每欲藉黨之政策之號召。以取得政權。政權旣得之後。政策果行與否。在所不計故不得志之政黨。因不能取得政權故。無異戰敗之國家。致有内部不平而生内訌也。此亦世界政黨變遷中。可注意之一事也。</p>

<p>與黨準備另推總裁</p>
<p>電通社五日東京電濱口首相本定昨日午後五時入院、因準備不及、故延至午後七時過、始見帝大之搬運病人車來到、八時十五分、首相瘦骨離、由夫人及近親者扶掖出門口、即登臥病人車、赴帝大醫院、車行速度每小時十哩、徐徐而行、八時四十五分抵帝大醫院再入第十二號病房、距其初次入院、恰七十四日也、</p>
<p>電通社五日東京電濱口首相再度入院、本定本日上午中開刀、由病院提早於今朝零時、即先注射「丹特旁」準備開刀、注射「林格爾」液後、即將首相移至手術室、眞鍋溝淵稻田三醫士亦來參與、於燈光灼燿之下、午前一時、即由鹽田博士開刀、祇三十分即畢事、一時四十五時、運回病房、施行手術後經過極佳、出血量亦少、故未行輸血、</p>
<p>電通社五日東京電鹽田博士爲濱口首相施行手術後、於午前二時、發表施行手術經過如下、注射「丹特旁」後行局部麻醉、於午前正一時、在左上腹部、開刀二寸、將所豫期癒着剝離、在手術中、首相言頭癢、請許其搔癢、態度與平常無異、手術結果極佳、</p>

<p>主席開會詞各位代表各位來賓各位同志、在「廣大無垠」「包羅萬有」的宇宙裏、燦爛地陳列着許多星系、在許多星系之中、有一個以太陽爲主體的太陽系、在環繞太陽運行不息的諸行星之中、有我們人類寄住着的地球、在地球之上、五大洲裏面、有一個亞細亞洲、在亞洲中華民國南京中央大學致知堂這個地方、在一九三一年四月五日這一天、舉行亞洲文化恊會第一次代表大會、在這次大會裏、有中華民旅的代表有印度民旅的代表、有高麗民旅的代表、有台灣民旅的代表、有安南民旅的代表、有其他亞細亞洲各被壓迫民旅的代表、大家都抱着宣揚亞洲文化、發展亞洲文化的决心、大家都懐着謀各民旅獨立和自由的壯志、大家都凖備着以各個民族的全力來參加并推進這個偉大艱鉅的工作、我們在這樣熱烈的革命空氣裏面、眞有無限的歡欣、無窮的希望、</p>
<p>各位被壓迫民旅的代表們、自從歐洲產業革命以來歐美的資本家、擁有龐大的資本、應用科學的方法、和用新式的生產機關剝削社會上大多數勞苦羣衆由血汗換來的的工資、遂形成了少數資本家壟斷一切經濟特權、把持一切政治勢力的形態、遂成爲國際資本帝國主義者、他們把握着最大多數人類悲慘的命運、他們直接間接的向各弱小民族施行政治的經濟的乃至文化的侵略、他們自己誇耀自己的文化實際上他們文化的本質只是物質的侵略他們的文化簡直是「物」的文化而不是「人」的文化、在現代的世界裏「物」的文化竟代替了「人」的文化這是多麽可痛而又可怕的事、</p>
<p>各位代表、我們都是被世界資本帝國主義者侵略的以上的事實我們自然是十分明瞭腦裏的印象、也自然是特别深刻、我們且看一看我們亞洲已往的文化是怎樣、孫總理在隻身北上的那一年、繞道日本神户、曾講演過一次題目日大亞洲主義内中曾說「我們亞洲是最古文化的發祥地、在幾千年以前我們亞洲的人、便已經得到了很高的文化」又說一「從根本上解部起來歐洲近百年的文化是科學的文化注重功利的文化、這種文化、應用到人類社會、只有物質文明、只有飛機炸彈、只有洋槍大炮專是一種武力的文化、歐洲人近來專用這種武力的文化來壓近我們亞洲所以我們亞洲便不能進步、這種專用武力壓迫人的文化就是行霸道、所以歐洲的文化、就是霸道的文化但是我們東方向來輕視霸道的文化、還有一種文化好過霸道的文化、這種文化的本質是仁義道德、就是行王道所以亞洲的文化是王道的文化」總理這種精密透澈的言論、對歐亞文化的解剖、除很明顯地暴露歐羅巴文化的弱點外、却一方面揭示出亞洲文化的優點和特質來、</p>
<p>在亞洲不但忠孝仁愛信義和平的中華民族、可代表亞洲文化、就是印席民族的温厚敏慧以及其他各民旅之寬大和平、也處處表現着亞洲文化的特質、我們試一翻往史無論中華文化印度文化土耳其斯坦文化整個亞洲文化都具有無上的價値和光榮這些往史的實錄都給我們以鐵的例證、</p>
<p>再比較着看、歐羅巴洲的文化、是使世界上大多數民衆呻吟痛苦的文化、是最近百餘年間興起的文化、是「物」的文化、是霸道的文化、亞細亞洲的文化、是具有解放一切被壓迫民族的特質的文化、是具有悠久的歴史過去的光榮的文化、是「人」的文化、是王道的文化、所以我們看看世界上受痛苦的民衆、我們看着亞細亞洲被壓迫的民族、我們應該以亞洲文化濟歐羅巴文化之窮、我們應該以亞洲文化抵抗歐羅巴文化第一步我們便應該在這個亞洲文化恊會國際組織之下、宣揚亞洲文化·發展亞洲文化我們更應該了解孫總理創立的三民主義、處處以人類幸福的均平做文化建設的張本、這正是集亞洲文化的大成以這應於現代的環境、我們便應當一致的根據三民主義的原則、聯合世界上以平等互相待遇的民族、組織民族的國際、復興亞洲文化、完成世界大同、</p>
<p>各位代表、各位同志、話說長、了現在且把幾點重要的意思、歸納在下面、（一）我們應認定·利用「物」力征服弱小民族施行殘暴於整個人類的就是歐羅巴洲的文化、「物」的野蠻的覇道的文化、（二）我們更應認淸·具有解旅被壓迫民族、拯救人類危亡的精神的、就是亞洲的文化、「人」的和平的王道的文化、（三）我們最近的努力·應該是宣揚亞洲文化、發展亞洲文化、以反抗歐羅巴的「物」的野蠻的覇道的文化、（四）我們要復興亞洲文化、拯救被壓迫民族、解放被壓迫民族、解除全人類的痛苦、只有本着一民主義的原則、聯合亞洲和世界民族、組織三民主義的民族國際、把實現世界大同的責任擔負起來、各位代表、各位同志、我們的責任、非常重大、我們的工作、非常艱鉅、我們應該以犧牲的精神、奮鬭的决心、按着適當的步驟、逐步的向前猛進、我們相信、最後的努力、必定得到最後的成功、我們從此努力、繼續的努力、</p>
<p>報告各位代表各位同志、我們經過了長時間的努力亞洲文化協會、於今天告一段落開成立大會了、這是多麽値得慶幸的事、各代表不遠千里來這裏開會、相聚一堂、允爲難得的機會、現在兄弟就借這個機會、略把本會籌備之經過爲各位報告、現在世界的文化、我們很明白地可以看得出·一種是「人」的文化、即亞洲文化、是講王道的、一種是「物」的文化·即歐洲文化、是講覇道的、這兩種根本衝突、水火不相容的文化、在世界裏面使形成兩個不同的階段、依現在的事實是說人的文化、已受壓制於物的文化、即歐洲文化壓制着亞洲文化、然從理論方面說、亞洲文化、爲世界最古且最優美的文化、不是我們自己誇張、就是歐洲各國稍有智識的人、誰也不敢否認、的不過我們亞洲人太輕忽了、我們亞洲文化在世界上的地位和價値、没有把他繼續地發揚光大起來、只把着保守的觀念、結果反日見其消沉了、我們感覺到這種危險、是亞洲的文化復興問題的一大障碍、所以有聯合亞洲各國同志組織本會的動機、亞洲各國同志、能明白這種道理爲切膚之痛、而且均有同樣的感覺、所以聞風興起、到處組織分會和通訊處、計成立分會和通訊處、南洋羣島·歐洲各地·美洲·加拿大·日本·朝鮮·台灣·印度·暹羅·安南·緬甸等處在中國有廣東·漢口·上海·北平等處、合計會員約有五</p>
<p>萬人之多、最近踴躍加入者、又紛至杳來此種盛况、實開亞洲民族團結之新紀元這是堪以報告於各位代表的、我想今日在座各代表、一定愉快非常、今日開第一次代表大會的目的、一方面是藉此選舉正式執監委員、使切實地肩負起本會的使命、謀會務的發展、一方面是要明瞭各地分會之情形、檢查過去的工作、彼此交換意見、共謀會務之發展、同時并團結我們亞洲民族的力量、完成世界文化革命爲目的、希望到會各代表盡量貢獻意見、以臻完善、惟是這次籌備的時間很短促、同人等能力有限、一切手續也許有不週到之處、對於各代表招待事宜、也許有缺點的地方、尚望各代表原諒原諒、</p>

<p>至於日本侵略我們的東北、已經成爲不可掩的事實了、他們有了歷史上的根據、外交上的根據、事實上的根據、拿一切的所謂繼承權·不平等條約·金融機關等、以南滿鐵路爲中心、著著進展着他們的侵略政策、甚而將地方的名稱、也都給他們完全改變了去、而視東北爲日本人的滿蒙了、不獨這樣、除了南滿鐵路沿線的政治上和文化上的各種侵略機關的特設以外、對於軍事上就居然越界設置砲壘、對於警察上就居然越界活動、還要自己宣稱、說是替中國縱持治安、替中國檢舉反動份子、這不是喧賓奪主、蔑視中國的主權麽、說到日本人的經侵略、就更其不用說了、我們在東北日常生活上所需要的一切大部份、都是日本人的、對於金融機關、中國雖然也有幾家銀行、但是左右金融的原動力、完全操在日人銀行的掌握裏、其他對於工業商業輸出輸入、都是一色一樣、　着他們日人的把持、甚至我們對於我們的生活、幾乎也有給日人握着咽喉的槪觀、這眞是一回極其危險的事、好像東北的物價、比之關内昂貴數倍的、就是因爲經濟組織、如工商業等都要用日金來做標凖的原故、以地大物博的東北、今日弄到金副紛亂、糧食凋殘的、都可以說完全受了日本帝國主義的支配、日本人旣然在東北有了這種地位他的所謂特殊利益、便自然而然超出當時日俄私相授受範圍以外了、本來日本人的所謂特殊利益、是日本戰勝了帝俄的時候、繼承了帝俄當時的所謂旣得權益的、可是現在怎麽樣了、豈不是已經超過了當時帝俄的旣得權益萬萬倍了麽、總觀以上的情形來講、東北旣然在這種四面受着帝國主義者環攻的重圍裏、我們爲要救中國起見、就要首先從日俄夾攻當中救出東北來、我們爲要達到自由平等起見、就要首先充實了中國門　的東北而使完整　缺、現在依兄弟簡陋的意見、以爲應有　下的决心和注意、</p>
<p>對於消極方面的、（一）要日本於棄其　　滿蒙特殊利益、　其未實行放棄以前、須防止其在滿蒙　　利益的範圍發展和　大、（二）要　　後前日本與第　國所定、對於日本在滿蒙地位之一切協定同時並防止日本對於第三國有同樣性質之任何協定（三）要堅壁淸賢、防止漢　和日本人私相授受的一切森林礦產土地之權利、（四）未收回中東路以前、要蘇俄誠意的履行中俄奉俄協定、對於中東路用人行政、槪以平等爲原則、（五）在中俄未恢復邦交以前、先要蘇俄保證、從今以後、不在中國宣傳共產主義、危害中國國體、及以金錢收買中國土匪變相之共產黨、　亂中國治安在旣恢復邦交之後、倘仍發見有共匪在中國境内騷動、蘇俄不能以其責任卸之於第三國際、（六）對於通商的問題、應有縝密的研究、因爲俄國之商業、是國家經營的、中國之商業、是私人經營的、此點雙方應議有最公平最妥當之辦法、以期中國在俄私營商業、不致受蘇俄國營商業之摧殘、（七）蘇俄應立即停止煽動和控制外蒙的一切行動並撤去駐在外蒙之蘇俄軍隊、</p>
<p>以上是消極方面的辦法、也即是對付帝國主義所應具的辦法、至於積極方面的辦法、是爲建設中國、尤其是建設東北而設想的、就是集中自己一切的力量、來開發東北的富源、即森林礦產、及移民墾荒、將東北充實起來、務使東北的地上、没有一寸的空餘和隙漏、才能够使帝國主義者無機可侵、不過無論消極的對付帝國主義者、和積極的謀中國之建設、尤其是東北之建設、總要站在統一和平穏固的基礎上、全國一致努力、然後取消不平等條約和中國之建設兩　大事業、方有成功的希望和把握、換一句話來講、中國不統一不和平、或是假統一假和平、而要取消不平等條約、和謀中國之建設、是無從做起的、國民外交恊會旣然爲泊救中國尤其爲救東北而發生了、那末就應該依照總理的遺屬、首先喚起全東北民衆、以謀整個的反抗帝國主義者中最强暴最險狠斩日俄侵略、因爲假令英法意美等國、都願意放棄不平等條約、但是日本仍然要維持他的特殊利益、蘇俄仍然未能停止對於東北的陰謀、那末東北一天不能自由、中國一天不能獨立今日的東北好像在中國是人身之有咽喉一樣、有生死存亡的關係、中國將來國運的盛衰、國力的消長、完全和東北問題的解决、有直接的影響、今天兄弟貢獻了這一點簡陋的意見、希望國民外交恊會的同人、喚起東北的民衆、努力向前、兄弟不才、也狠願意跟着諸位同志之後、共同奮鬥、</p>

<p>公共租界行政槪况</p>
<p>上海靑年會前日舉行之市政演講、題爲「公共租界市政槪况、」主講者爲納稅華人會秘書何德奎氏、兹記演詞如下、</p>
<p>（一）公共租界之起源在一八四二年中英簽訂南京條約、規定廣州·厦門·福州·寗波·及上海·等五口通商、翌年、上海乃闢爲外僑通商之地、准英人在洋涇浜以北居住、惟吾國官廳不許國人將土地斷賣與英人、祗准英人有永租權、此租界之名所由來也、其後他國亦紛與淸廷訂立通商條約、以此在英租界地居住者、尚有他國人士、美國敎土商人、間有在虹口置產居住者、遂成爲所謂美租界、英美兩租界之區域、因人烟日稠、均經擴充、一八六三年、英美租界合併、是爲公共租界、此公共租界起源之大略也、</p>
<p>（二）公共租界中外雜居之現狀在一八九九年以前、公共租界之地、凡一萬零六爲零六畝、今之公共租界區域係一八九九年經上</p>
<p>海道　允擴充者、較之原有區域、約增至三倍有餘、計凡三萬三千五百零三畝依去年十月之人口統計、公共租界之居民、來自四十七國、其中外籍男女老少共三萬六千四百餘人、日本人有一萬八千四百餘爲最多、其次英國人有六千二百餘俄國人有三千四百餘、再次爲印度人、美國人、葡萄牙人、各在一千以上、吾國人之居住公共租界者、男女老少計有九十七萬一千餘人、其中江蘇籍佔五十萬爲最多、其次則爲浙江籍計三十萬人、廣東籍佔四萬四千餘安徽籍佔二萬餘、爲第四位、此公共租界之區域與人口之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>（三）公共租界之自治制度公共租界之市政爲地方自治制、地皮章程、爲其自治之根、本大法、依是項章程之規定、市政權屬於納稅人、凡界内之外國人、其執業之地產、價値滿五百兩、而除執照捐外、每年所付地產或房產或房地兩產之捐在十兩以上者、或賃居每年租金在五百兩以上之房屋而付捐者、均有納稅人之資格、有選舉工部局董事之權、並可出席於納稅人會議、至於界内外國人每年除執照捐外、付地捐滿五十兩或賃居年租在一千二百兩以上之居屋、而付捐者、則除能出席於納稅人會及有選舉權外並有被選舉而工部局董事之資格、工部局外籍董事、、依地皮章程之規定、至少不得過五人、至多不得過九人、每年由駐滬各國領事、於二月或三月中、定期召集外籍納稅之年會、除選舉董事外、並於此年會中、議决一切工部局重要問題、又審查工部局前年度之决算、及議决本年度之預算、此項年會、並無法定人數、不問出席人數多寡、均可開會、惟各種議案、仍取决於出席者之過半數、臨　遇有租界特别問題、可由領事一人或數人召集、或納稅人二十五人連署請求、得開外籍納稅人特别會議、此特别會議、必須有外籍納稅人三分之一之出席、方可開會、仍以出席者過半數取决議案、工部局董事、會須將過去一年間之市政經過情形、製作報告書、并須將上年度决算書及本年度預算案、一併提出於納稅人年會、租界内外籍納稅人共有二千七百人左右、然出席於年會者、人數並不多、工部局所提出之案、通常槪予通過、此公共租界自治制度之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>（四）納稅華人與租界市政之關係納稅華人會自一九二六年起可推出華董三人加入工部局、參與租界市政、此事雖於地皮章程内無所規定、然曾由領事團與中國當局磋商協定、華董三人之最初加入工部局、爲一九二八年事、至一九三○年西　數仍爲九人、而華董則增至五人、此亦經過領事團與中國當局之磋商而始决定也、納稅華人之資格、以及有被選爲華董之資格、與上所述外籍納稅人以及外籍董事完全相同、惟外籍董事不必在上海居住五年以上、而依納稅華人會章程、凡華董須居住租界五年以上、此其差異耳、</p>
<p>（五）工部局董事會及委員會之組</p>
<p>織目下工部局董事會、共有董事十四人、除華董五人之外、通例有英籍董事五人、美籍二人、日籍二人、工部局重要行政、皆取决於董事會、而董事會復有聘任或辭退在局供職人員之權、董事會當會、每二週間或三週間舉行一次、平時如有重要公文、均分送各董事批註意見、董事會有董事長一人、副董事長一人、由董事中互推之、所有董事皆爲名譽職、並不支薪、惟因董事會待决之事甚多、而性質上又甚複雜、故於董事會之外、更設有各種委員會、如警務·財務·工務·衛生·敎育·員司·交通·公用事業·音樂·圖書·公共體育塲·等委員會是也、此等委員會之人數、少則二三人、多則七八人、凡較爲重要之委員會、必有董事一人或二人在内、工部局如有某問題發生、通例先望該管委員會加以討論、有所表决、再由董事會覆核、須董事會核准方爲有效、此等委員會、各就其該管事務、分别討論、更須得董事會之核准、故辦事程序上較爲完密、此等委員會、除一二有給者外、大都皆爲名譽職、當一九二八年、納稅華人會、推華董三人、加入工、</p>
<p>部局董事會時又曾推華委員六人、加入工部局各項委員會、近年以來、工部局因常有特别問題發生、增新設若干委員會、增請華委員加入、故在工部局各項委員會中、華委員之總數、已在十人以上、董事會與各種委員會、因皆爲名譽職、又因各董事及各委員、皆各經營事業、故祇能顧及較爲重要之問題、且祇能决定方針、使工部局常僱有給之公務人員、照其所定方針、執行事務（六）工部局之常務機關工部局之各種執行權、皆在常僱有給之公務人員手中、有給人員中最高位置原、名爲Ｄirector　General自本年四月一日起、改名爲Ｓecretary_General所譯爲督辦、立其下者有總辦、Ｓecrtarg以及警務處長、財務處長、工務處長、衛生處長、敎育處長、捐務處長、檢舉員Ｍmunioipal　Advocate救火隊長、萬國商團團長等、分司各項行政、上述各處、用員旣多、需費頗巨、工部局在一九三○年預算、全年經常費爲一千六百萬兩、其中警務處佔五百四十餘萬兩、工務處佔三百七十餘萬兩、衛生處佔八十餘萬兩、總務處佔五十九萬兩、而財務處亦佔二十七萬餘兩、此均爲工部局較重要之機關、總辦處之所以得名者、因工部局一切對外之文告、均須經由總務處布告也、</p>
<p>（七）對於工部局最低限度之希望公共租界之居民、據一九三○年之調查、所有外人、合計之不過佔全數居民百分之三强、其餘皆爲華人、在租界内之財產、以及所繳之租稅、華人亦佔半數以上因此租界行政與一切措施、其影響於華人、自較外人爲鉅、我租界内之行政、向來偏重外人、所有高級行政人員、皆爲外籍、華人位置、每低於外籍人員、亦並無實權在手、因風俗習慣語言等、華人之與外人、各不相同、故工部局高級行政人員之一切措施、每不適宜於華人、致引起種種誤會、或竟至引起不幸事端、目前在董事會、雖已華董、各項委員會、亦已有華委員加入、較之往者、固已進步不少、然有給高職人員之用華人、俾得盡其全力、襄辦行政事宜、至今尚不多見、殊爲缺憾、界内華人、旣佔總人口百分之九十六以上、自應增用華人爲高級有給人員、俾增進行政上之效率、蓋爲居住界内多數華人謀福利、即爲公共租界市政謀改進也、高級行政人員、若能多用華人、則工部界一切措施、必能免除種種隔閡、本中外合作之精神、共謀界内市政之進步、工部局目前之要着、無有過於此者、輓近吾國人對于各國在華租界、曾有堅持之主張、在此過渡期間、租界當局、自應有　底之覺悟與光明之態度、惟此項問題、因與本題討論範圍稍有不同、加以時間怱促、不能詳爲論述、故僅述最低限度之希望如右、</p>

<p>二十年三月十日、在上海市地方自治訓練所演　紀錄稿、</p>
<p>諸　、兄弟今天演講題目是呌自治與約法、要把在訓政時期的約法和自治有甚麽關係這一點、在這短時間稍爲說明一下、在未說明以前、先把從前中華民國已有的約法、和中國國民黨總理從前所主張的約法、究竟是什麽一回事、大略說一說、我們知道約法在中華民國是有過的、即民國元年的臨時約法、在二次革命以後袁世凱預備要做　帝、就解散國會毁棄約法、此時本黨總理將國民黨改組爲中華革命黨、預備再爲主義而奮鬥、爲民國而奮鬥、在西南聯絡、反對袁世凱稱帝、袁世凱到底失敗、這次革命戰事、可以說是護國、也可以說是護法、護法的意義、就是維護約法袁氏死後、由黎元洪繼任大總統、下令召集國會遵守約法、但不久民國六年張動陰謀復辟、又逼他解散國會、那時有伍廷芳先生等到南方來、追隨總理、在廣袁召集非常國會從事護法運動、後來北方吳佩孚倒戈、黎元洪再召集民六國會、賄選曹錕爲總統並在十二年十月十日頒布憲法、即我們所稱的「曹錕憲法」、其中彎彎曲曲的轉變很多、我爲甚麽要報告這一叚的歷史呢、就是要使得諸位明白、約法憲法在中華民國的歷史上已經都有過的、但約法憲法是否有效、全靠人民有没有守法的人、假使没有守法的人、雖有約法憲法皆是紙上文章、是不生效力的、所以我們希望要大家在法律、範圍之内做事不能夠認爲有了法律一切事情都好了、有了這種觀念、恐防依然難免從前的錯誤、所以把已往歷史簡略報告一下、</p>
<p>現在中央要在開國民會議時、訂定約法、我們當然希望有約法同時要希望有守法的人、如果無守法的人、就要蹈已往的覆轍、現在中國國民黨、國民政府、已决心要立約法、而總理一向也是主張法治民治的人、在人家破壞約法時、就想來護法二次革命雖然失敗還要再繼續努力以冀達到最後之勝利兹將國民黨迭次對於約法的主張講一講、第一次全國代表大會、乃總理在世時親自召集的、大會宣言、即大會之結晶、　第一次全國代表大會宣言、批評當時的救國主張有四派、第一爲立憲派、這一派就是主張只要有了　法即能救中國、故宣言中有一叚、「…民元以來、嘗有　法矣、然專制餘孽、軍閥官僚僭竊擅權、無惡不作、…」這是指曹錕走狗一派、還有「…此輩一日不去、憲法一日不生效力…」等語、這是說曹錕等軍閥官僚借憲法以僭竊職位、殊不知有　法而無守法的人、憲法也是没有用的、所以第一次全國代表大會宣言、說明白立憲主張不能救國家的第　是聯省自治派這一派在民國八九年、可稱盛極一時、他們主張是中國太大不如省一省的自治起來、可是第一次全國代表大會宣言、指這一派的主張、不是眞眞救國家不過少數軍閥、想借此名目來割據地盤而已、此派主張人物、陳炯明、唐繼堯趙恒惕、等、本黨總理非反對自治蓋自治必須國家眞正統一然後才能談到自治、訓政時期、就是要從地方自治做起、必人民有自治能力、約法憲法始得保障、訓政時期、就是實行地方自治時期、自然要在革命軍底定之後、</p>
<p>說到這一點、本黨自十五年北伐以後、到二十年北伐本應早已完成、無如十七年十八年十九年、軍閥相繼揚亂、建設無由進展此四五年以來、中央努力於討伐叛逆的工作、一直到去年閻馮反動大集團形成、此爲本黨與反動派最後之戰、雖未達革命最後目的、然國民革命亦有相當的勝利、其環境當與從前不同此時國民黨如再不講約法、不做地方自治工作、不努力於訓政建設、是則國民黨變了騙人了、在軍政時期、是用軍法、到革命軍統一全國之後、就是訓政時期、軍法自不適用、訓政時期是要講法律、當然是需要約法的、中央幾位同志要在召集國民會議時、討論約法、這種約法、即訓政時期的約法、亦訓政時期舉國上下所應共同遵守的約法、第一次全國代表大會宣言、指立憲派是騙人的、聯省自治派也是騙人的、國民黨因鑒於從前人的錯誤、故主張經過軍政時期之後、到了訓政時期、才有約法、建國大綱雖寥寥二十五條、但對軍政訓政憲政三時期的工作規定已很明白、凡各省縣祇要在國民政府勢力所及之地、即爲訓政開始之時、再　同盟會（一九○五）宣言、還有民國之前、宣言内四綱之外、即有三期、（一）軍法之治（即軍政時期）、（二）約法之治（訓政時期）、（三）憲法之治（憲政時期）、可知劃分軍政訓政憲政三時期、在同盟會時代、早已决定、再看孫卒學說第六章内有一段、「…規定革命進行時期爲三、第一爲軍政時期第二訓政時期、第三憲政時期、…」底下還有解釋「　第二爲破壞時期擬在此時期内、施行軍法以革命軍担任打破滿淸之專制、摕除官僚之腐敗、改革風俗之惡習、解脫奴婢之不平、洗淨鴉片之流　、破滅風水之迷信、　除釐卡之阻礙等事、…」軍政時期之工作、是以軍力掃除官僚軍閥、以及洗淨鴉片流毒釐卡等事、但鴉片至今日、還不能肅淸假使在軍政期、把種鴉片者、販鴉片者吃鴉片者用軍法治之、到此時就可没有鴉片了、但這種工作、在軍政時期不及去做、到現在訓政時期、要做這種工作就比較難了一點、又如裁釐亦是軍政時期内作的到民國二十年一月一日才把全國釐金裁掉、這都是在軍政時期没有廠到做軍政時期的工作的緣故第二爲過渡時期過　的意義、是破壞時期到建設時期的中間、謂之過　時期底下還有說明「…擬在此期内施行約法（非現行者）、建設地方自治、促進民權發達、以一縣爲自治單位、縣之下再分爲鄉村區域…」這一段有「非現行者」四字他的意義是指所謂約法、非當時的臨時約法、可見本黨總理的主張、始終是一貫的是在訓政時期中、要有一種建設地方自治促進民權發達的約法、建國大綱、雖寥寥數條、然精神却重在地方自治、至於訓政時期的　始在建國大綱第七條、已很明白規定是「凡一省完全底定之日、則爲訓政開始之時、而軍政停止之日」、譬如國民軍到浙江後、再由浙江而江蘇、是則浙江軍事已算底定、即爲訓政開始之期、建國大綱第九·十·十一·十二·十三·十四·等條、都是注重於地方自治、地方自治新辦的工作、例如調查户口、測量土地、整理警務改良衛生、擴充敎育、以及修築道路等等、辦理時間暫定爲三年、假使在三年内、將上列各事辦好、則人民即可選舉縣長、若不到三年而能將以上各事辦妥、則縣長亦可由人民選舉、如一省内每　都已能如此、即爲憲政開始時期、省長亦就可由人民選舉、總理所主張的自治、是由下級做起、不是像曹錕陳炯明等掛起等法或自治招牌、來做他們的工具、如果全國有過半數的省分、省長皆由人民選舉、完成地方自治、此時即可召集國民大會、（與現在要召集的國民會議性質不同）、决定憲法而頒布之、頒布憲法之日、即爲憲政告成、那時國民政府、完全是一個民選的政府可見訓政時期的約法、就是大家在訓政時期内共同遵守的法律、同憲法性質是各别的看建國大綱第二十二條、「憲法草案當本於建國大綱及訓政憲政兩時期的成績、由立法院議　、隨時宣傳於民衆、以備到時採擇施行、可知憲法是要參照兩時期的成績由立法院草訂、到開國民大會時、付會表决而頒布之、所以約法同憲法根本不相同、</p>
<p>本黨總理是特别注意到在訓政時期、要努力於地方自治的、所以對於地方自治所辦的工作、在地方自治　始實行法上、如淸查户口·立機關·定地價·修道路·墾荒地·設學校·規定得很詳細、今後制定約法、一定要把這種精神灌輸進去、然後不落空虛訓政時期國民黨是要使人民能受運用四權的訓練、　國民會議、是政府同人民合作的機會、所謂「約法」二字的意義就是人民與政府的公約、換句話說、就是大家共同的契約、假使約法規定是一百條這一百條契約、大家是要共同遵守的、定約法就是要把總理全部遺敎、歸納起來、斟酌時勢的需要、遵守訓政的綱領齊齊整整寫幾條條文使大家在訓政時期共同遵守、這　法無論是黨員非黨員、政府及人民都要遵守的定約法的意義、在中央紀念週上蔣主席和戴季陶委員都說得很明白、是爲求國家永久和平統一與建設而定約法、故約法如果不注重地方自治的培養、與完成統一與建設的目的、是不能達到約法如果只注意到總統制内閣制院制兩院制的規定、而忽略了建國大綱上所規定的訓政時期工作的範圍換言之、忽略了地方自治、則今後的約法或將等於民元約法、而非總理所希望的約法了、</p>
<p>若有人要問旣有總理遺敎、爲甚麽還要再訂約</p>
<p>法、其實訂約法是爲人民容易明瞭總理遺敎便於共同遵守起見、故訂約法、一方面不能違背總理遺敎、一方面還要訓練一般國民澈上澈下來遵守約法、如果有了法、而没有守法的人、這法還是無用的、要有守法的人、就要培養地方自治的人才諸位明白這一點、就該知過自己的責任非常重大諸位在此研究畢業後、還有許多工作在將來要幹、不要以爲在這三月内是來學、大外邊便不必學在外邊時時刻刻都是在那裏學而且這些學、還是眞眞的學、現在你們所學的、不過學些自治法規的條文和自法事業的項目而已、所以實在的學、是要到社會上去學的、諸位所負的責任非常重大、希望諸位努力、（完了）</p>

<p>前閱自由談。載有紫雲等四洞紀勝。但皆在北山一路。於南山四洞。槪未提及。兹爲補叙於後。</p>
<p>由楊梅嶺拾級而登烟霞洞。洞外圍有竹籬。備游客歇輿之處。洞口不廣。而高深祗十餘步。故洞中不甚幽濕。洞内石壁鑿有小佛橡數百。狀態各異。惟不及飛來峰上所刻之生動雄偉耳。洞底壁上有一小洞。徑僅盈尺。黑暗異常。探手入内。寒氣逼人。投之以石。不聞墮聲。或云此洞可通天目山。齊東野語。不値識者一笑。</p>
<p>自烟霞左折而下。過一凉亭。乃至水樂洞。洞有二口。分别左右。洞内冷氣骨。雖在盛夏。亦似暮秋。僧人設桌椅欵客。且命小僧提燈引導。一探洞底。洞深可百數十尺。寬及八九尺。内甚潮濕。石壁有水潛然下流。雖鋪有水泥甬道。亦濘滑難行。撫壁走十餘步。有石藕石筍兩兩對峙。惟不甚似眞者。蓋非人工所爲也。再進則寬僅容身。左有石鼓。擊之成聲。右之石鐘。僅以形似。非眞能發鐘聲也。更進已不能昻首。須傴僂而行。脚底水聲潺潺。陰森可畏。將及洞底。始見寒泉湍瀉。誠壯觀也。洞底亦有一小洞。僧謂尚能開鑿。惟工程浩大耳。</p>
<p>再由水樂盤旋而上。至石屋洞。洞外寺院淸潔。爲數洞冠。花木茂盛。池石幽雅。儼然世外桃源。則非他洞之荒蕪可比矣。洞中四壁。亦彫有佛像高大不一。洞甚淺。故尚明。地亦不濕。洞内中央穿有方池。泉水起旋波亦如虎跑。僧人於水置一碗。謂有人能以錢擲中者。與佛有緣。愚夫愚婦。莫不爭先解囊。故累積池底。僧人歛錢之方。不可謂不巧矣。洞旁有石級十餘。又一洞徒有四壁。一無足觀。洞底投之以石。則淙然有聲。乃池泉之下流也。</p>
<p>從石屋洞寺院後户上山行不遠。即見巖石嶙峋中。現一小洞。俗稱仙人洞。洞口狹隘不堪。須俯首而入。洞中僅容方丈中供宋高宗小像僧言當南渡時。金兵追高宗抵抗。帝避於此洞七晝夜。後正位臨安。始保江南半壁云。想亦係無稽之談耳。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>吾邑前此來一奇丐。彳亍道左。日誦般若波縱密多心經。易資以自給。人以其誦經不苟且從事。咸樂向之購。有訽之者。丐必曰。吾前半世造孽深重。身後恐墮地獄因以此自懺。且人得吾經。人亦積得一些功德也。族弟裕泉。家居嘉善。告我以此丐事甚詳。因書之。</p>
<p>丐氏朱。名阿四。浙之嘉善人也。其兄行二。以遜淸鴻博豪於一鄉。四固困極。人或速其依阿兄以居。朱必傲然答曰。此烏乎可。苦亦尋常事耳。吾欲致富。豈待今日。吾兄固豪於一鄉。其如身後何。言訖。必作不屑狀而去。初朱家亦非寒素。少年即有聲色之好。嘗挾千金之海上。徜徉北里間。罄其資而返。無怨色也。且謂金錢用於女子。事亦至樂。若斤斤出以金錢爲生命者。是蓋愚之至矣。言時且舉龔定公願得黃金千萬兩。交盡天下名士美人之句以自豪。其豪邁不覊。有如是者。尋忽失蹤他去。後十年。忽飄然行乞以返。槁首枯顔鶉衣百結。日必沿街托鉢。且以捕蛇爲業。其技之佳。無足與匹。故鄉里間無賴之徒。咸師事之。捕蛇之名。乃偏全浙。然將軍雞免陣前亡。朱故善捕蛇者。在浙紹某山。竟坐是而毁其目。初其徒衆猶年供奉之。毌稍玩忽。特朱不欲因人以食。乃去而遍走江浙間。以行乞誦經自懺。蓋少年時妄殺生靈。積罪殊深。猶冀放下屠刀。立地成佛。若朱丐者。有足多焉。因書其事以諷世。</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>一個人的幼年是發育時代中年是敎育時代。晚年乃是發跡時代。所以一個大人物事業的成功。輒在五十歲以後。而反言之。一個人少年得志。輒難久長。這種主張。在下並不是胡說。非但有事實可以證明。且亦爲普通人所能推知。因爲中年時代。尚是預備的時代。中年發跡多係機遇。立基不固。傾圯可慮。你想對也不對。</p>
<p>英國國會裏的秘書長。本是一個好官職這是擢升各部大臣的一個過渡階級自來英國各部有名的大臣。莫不是秘書長出身。亦可見秘書長地位的優越最近之充任此職者爲佛蘭克司密士。佛於去年始就此職。現年七十六歲了。他的上司喬治蘭司勃氏也是一個晚年才發跡的人。雖然他曾於一九一零年一度入國會爲議員。然而他第一次被任政府要職時。年已七十。此外如現任英國飛行大臣之安勃里公爵。亦遲至七十歲的當兒方在政治舞台上現身說法亦可見人生七十。並不爲老。而老當益壯。尤非虛語。</p>
<p>晚年發跡的事。不僅在政治界中有之。即在其他各種事業上。亦莫不如此。瑞典有一位老人。呌做漢爾范生。最近他死了。享年一百零二歲。其一生事業。大都耗廢於農田工作及年旣長。臂力漸衰。精神仍舊。他就抛棄了田塲工作。而從事於漁獵他並不以年老自餒。重新學起打槍之術。死前一年。他還在瑞典某處。得着打靶競賽的錦標呢。</p>
<p>姜太公八十遇文王。他一身偉大的事業。全在八十以上方才成就所以一個人少年失敗不足爲慮。年高力衰。不可自餒。深望讀余文者深長思之。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>我國風俗。縱各地不同。然遊戲中之踢子一項。則南北均嗜之。淵源頗古。實與蕩秋千同爲有益之運動也。曩歲我鄉褚民誼先生。提倡踢毽子甚力。謂斯項遊戲。全身各部。莫不有相關之運動。目所注。手所揮。足所射。無一不相聯絡。誠增進健康發揚體力之絶妙方法。其言良是。殊爲關心體育者所樂聞也。踢毽之法。徴諸全國。大同小異我鄉流行。率在每歲冬春取其天時凛烈。足以却寒。至花樣翻新斯有掃跳提環種種名目。大抵以踢法不同。而稱謂自異。考其分類。正不下數十項之多惟我鄉踢毽。負者祇罰進一籌。而閩省比賽。每以糖果花生。爲戰利之品。此殆增加雙方興趣。然用金錢作輸贏者。却屬鮮見。</p>
<p>據友人談。滿人自入關中。亦雅好爲踢毽之戲。初春佳日。長幼皆集。毽製獨精。上綴羽毛。率分爲紅黑黃白各種輕重長短。各隨所好。亦可謂特别考究者矣。北平之善斯藝者。不獨能左右踢。即身後無須返顧亦能足頂而不落地。技之熟練。非數載功夫。正不易臻此云。</p>
<p>毽子古亦行於歐洲。羅馬盛時。民間頗有好之者。不過毽用長毛。式亦較巨。一遞一送。須擇對手。足部所具之花樣。更比我國素習者爲簡。斯後網球之興。其法即根據踢毽子而來。故自十四世紀以後。毽成落伍。而網球漸躋於運動中之要位矣。毽之英名爲Shnttle　Cock。可知英國古時。亦未嘗無此遊戲。上爲沈君所言。沈昔留學英國。似非無據也。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>三號。史他那道導余游英女皇維多利亞宮。從大學去。乘汽車。每人二安。至則從北門入門。兩旁雙獅像。至大門。即見陳列銅炮兩尊。紅頭巡捕帶皮帶守衛若朝儀。然入則巡捕甚多。如禁宮矣。其下陳列各種油畫。爲維女皇各種之像。上層陳列。内層則其夫阿爾伯及子愛德華Albert　＆　Edward之象。維皇即位及受洗之像。自少年以至老年各種像。騎馬之像。寫信之像。及最後致印度之信。觀其著盛裝之服。拖長盈丈。須有人爲從後面拖之。而余以前在電影中所見西女宮裝。尾帶有長兩丈者。中國君夫人及服翟鳥之服。蓋皆仿鳥長尾之美而爲之。此殆審美之公例。而一人不如鳥天然美之證乎。余觀長尾。難有長二丈餘之尾者。其尊嚴亦比人間貴嬪矣。</p>
<p>此宮殿下之上圓。極爲莊嚴。令人想見北京頣和園那拉后之景像。至上層到處有紅長髯之巡捕。似將臨敵。然其陳列則全印各地之風景房舍。亦有英國砲臺。兵士大砲演操之景。有喜馬拉雅山之景。山上洋房甚多。蓋印度苦熱。在彼避熱也。各地陳香爐不少。似亦燒香。而印人田女來觀者不少。令人想見北平三殿之御爐香也。至最上層。爲圓蓋。全圓蓋高可二三丈。可望不可即。全是女皇各種彩色像俯視下層中廳。亦塑女皇像。其南門陳列大砲及短砲。有兩砲奪自法國者。除女皇外。武將文官之像。女官之像不少。此宮建設。大半用大理石。問之印人。此石來自北印度。火車須四五日方到。其第三層陳列國書及公文。英印各種文字印章。關朝廷之事。而亦間以印度士風。各種景致。蓋西人之方法。每於陳列館兩兩對照。以其長形人之短。使人愧服驚嘆。其政敎藝術之偉大而伏降也。不亦偉哉。且見將來耳。</p>
<p>印度植物甚多。入其菜市。所可識者無幾。樹木則高大濃陰。在其下實較住室中爲佳。不見日光而又淸凉。故印度人喜臥地上。即樂園也。吾人到此。亦喜在樹下坐。故佛之敎樹下劣乃一種定制。臥地上亦佛之訓也。至今各地印度人。仍喜臥於地。在新加坡各地均見之。初以爲怪。今乃知其俗然也。石榴甚美。似中國有桃梨。辣椒盛行。葱尤普遍。辣椒彼名奇利。即所云吃加利飯是也。印人不讀加利。而讀奇利。錫蘭人尤喜食桂皮彼以爲常食。吾不堪也。芭蕉葉大如席包物均用之。蘿苟色白胡桃。甚大似中國。糖產不少。滿街糖食點點心店。亦頗美味。可怪者獨少飯店耳。客人則大不便矣。</p>

<p>（四）宣傳文化文化旣爲立國三要素之一、宜發揚而光大之明矣我國人之學西洋者、每有不學其精神而學其皮毛之弊、以是鄙視祖國文化而過分崇拜外人、外帮即利用此種心理、實施其文化侵略且一般外人對我國文化幾全然不知見黃種人之有禮貌及衣冠整潔之男女、則曰日本人美麗之中國貨爲日本貨此旅行歐美者類能言之又法文字典中有一字曰、中國化Ｃhinoiserie即咒人不整潔之謂觀此可知文化之尊卑與國際地位及民族優劣有如斯密切之關係可不竭力宣傳哉、夫我國故都　宮之壯麗陵孔之雄偉、以及各寺觀之莊嚴、長城運河之偉大、磁譽美術之精妙、四庫全書之富涵以及内地民風淳樸、皆足以表示極悠久秀美之文化、而使外人敬仰不已者、若作成有系統之中國旅行訪問片及歷史片演映於外帮數年之後且觀其輿論及影響較之今日又當何似反之外人所製之片、關於有傷人道之舉以及姦淫盜賊奴婢之表演均由中國人任之、　其寓意在使一般觀衆咸目中華民族爲世界最早汚最　　之民族使其國人君策羣力以消滅此　乏文化之民族、其用意深刻已極、凡曾遊歷外帮者見之、莫不痛心、近今電影之學、日益昌盛而曰人即利用之以介紹歐美新發明之各種科學以供借鏡故其文化進步、亦隨而猛晋、可知電影事業與文化關係之重要可不急起直追哉</p>
<p>（五）宣傳敎育立國大本在於敎育電影、尤能輔助敎育之不及、其功能可以轉移社會習尚、改良民衆思想、如近今國際聯盟會、特設電影一司、以制裁各國影片之劇情其用意蓋以毌煽亂人</p>
<p>起見、專攝製彼帝制時代貴族之殘暴行爲、爲烘托其赤色主義之需要以集中民族思想、至於其他之藉電影以作北極探險、菲洲見聞游記等、以作政治及科學之參考者尤更僕難數、在醫學上如微生虫之變態及人體之解剖等、在歷史上如古代英雄之豐功偉蹟、哲人之言行等、在地理上如山川之形勢、各地之風俗等、在軍事上如射擊之訓練、後方之佈置等、在自然科學上、如自然之程度及發明等、在法律上如法庭審判犯罪者之行爲及受審時之情狀等、均可補助敎育之不及、而增進民衆之常識、其功用之廣大、可調宣傳之最利工具、無出其右者矣、我國今日學校敎育、旣不普通設備又極簡陋、社會敎育更不待言、無論國際禮貌、即公共道德個人行檢、亦不講求、倘將各國社會敎育之實情以及市政鄉村工廠管理學校設施等等之狀况、用影片詳加示範其稗益於我國敎育前途、寗有涯涘、今日所見之西洋影片叙述、彼國之富有及描寫其淫癖邪侈爲害甚烈、何足言益、</p>
<p>（六）宣傳衛生國之安寗在乎一國之組織完備、人之幸福系乎一己之心身健全我國之民不幸有東亞病夫之稱、其　孰甚然而國民大多數心身不健全、殊屬事實、此皆由於不衛生所致也、政府雖竭力推行衛生新政、而效未大彰、其故何也、蓋由於習慣使然、試觀夫閭閻街衢汚穢垃圾塡塞、皆是臭氣薰人、殊不可耐即繩之以法、而猶離悛改良、以民衆無絲毫衛生之常識、有以致之、夫死與病人所同懼也、壯與健人所同樂也、然而莫知適從者何也、曰缺乏宣傳而已、今若以電影、示以生病之來由及病菌傳染之猖獗、與夫健體益壽之方法、則民衆可得相當之常識、政府而督促之於後不特民族日趨於强、而衛生之習慣、養成外人、亦必從而敬視之、民族地位之增高、猶其餘事、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c172">超現實主義的繪畫 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>超現實主義（Sur　Realisme）是起於最近法蘭西詩壇的一種新詩運動的命名、這主義、同時又波及於同樣傾向的畫家、因此、在法蘭西的畫壇上、超現實主義運動、也跟着勃興起來、</p>
<p>依他們的主張、超現實主義對於在從來被忘却的某種形態、聯想底優秀的實在、夢的全能、凡思想上底無關心的活動力、都要樹立在確信之上的、</p>
<p>超現實主義是一種的世界認識、是給以根本思想的槪念底世界觀、牠的理論、是根據着柏爾桑（Henri　Bergson）的言論爲主潮、同時又拿處雷德（Freud）的精神分析學（Psychoananalysise）來做基礎的、</p>
<p>自然科學、固然否認在時間與空間範圍内底現象以外的世界、但這是偏限於現實方面而言的、此外、我們的精神生活中、還有了超越自然的法則以上底創造的作用到頭、樹立在以觀察和經騐爲基礎底物質的經騐上、依照精神生活或直感而到達事物的眞相——這柏爾桑的哲學、就是他們超現實主義者極表同情的地方、</p>
<p>虎雷德的無意識底世界的探求、尤其是幻夢的解釋、也給他們以莫大的刺戟、他們要從無意識的精神作用底夢幻中、摑出精神的本質把超越現實的夢的狀態、意識的地、誘致現實的世界來、創造新的世界、那就是繪畫、就是詩、這種塲合、他們不認爲像從來一般地以夢爲現實的從屬、而是爲了夢的自身底絶對的一現象而處理的、</p>
<p>超現實主義者、不僅要廢棄了意大利文藝復興以來的美學、而且還持有排除拉丁底現實的基礎那樣的元氣、他們輕蔑了調和的法則、漠視了古典的（Cbassic)約束的敎條、站在法蘭西最前線上的前哨兵－超現實主義者－看精神恰似日常的說話一樣其結果、對之迄於今日的急進畫家們所蔑視的、且目爲驚愕般神秘般、内的生活般、魔術般的空想的（Romantic）議論再培成其存在的資格、他們愛好藝術的底、不合理的底、直觀的底朴素的表現形態、</p>
<p>超現實主義的宣言、有一段是這樣說的、「超現實主義、并不滿足於某一派或一鄉土的表現、統集歐洲之所以分裂及其生存的要素、并非得吸收全世界上所有的主義不可、超現實主義、是現代上的一大運動、那是要意味健康容易地把衰頽與病弱的傾向克服、」</p>
<p>超現實主義的代表畫家有、奇利可（Giorgio　de　Chirico）愛倫斯特（Max　Ernst彌羅（Joan　Miro）瑪遜（Andre　Massno)等、</p>
<p>奇利可被目爲其隊中的領袖、在一千八百八十八年生於希臘的梵洛、雖然他是一個意大利人、但他的身上是交流着西西利亞的血的、他是一個獨學的畫家、以前曾住過米蔭憶旋因戰事起歸而製作於羅馬、後又遷到巴黎現住的地方來、</p>
<p>他曾鄙視過那很多靑年的才能畫家、聚集在未來派（Futurists）拿下的時候、（Impressionists）無論是印象派野獸派（Fauvists）抽象派（Absolutists）他都没有參加過而且也不墮於文學的咏嘆他本其達識淵博的思想、來理解偉大古典藝術底智識的精神的原則、探究過去繪畫底純粹的傳統、這麽一個神秘家詩人的他、以獨自的眼、特異的心、來觀察宇宙、經騐宇宙、由祖國底傳統的古典的過去、創造出新的構圖來、誠然、奇利可的作品、是巧妙地、利用古典的傳統本質的寄與、而成功爲可驚的幻想底結晶的、他以光線色彩及陰影、結合構成對照線和空間、那種彫刻的形態的創造、是授與獨特的新價値、於古曲及近代的習慣上、</p>
<p>奇利可看察夢幻等於數學一樣、以魔術的幾何學、把夢幻現爲實在、他最近的夢幻屢屢像奔馬般地現出、</p>
<p>他曾因形而上學的實在論而被稱爲形而上學派、現今他做了超現實主義者、但其固有的本質、并不因之而起别種的變化、</p>
<p>愛倫斯特、一千八百九十一年生於德國萊茵的浦柳愛爾、曾就學於狄友些多忽（Dusseldorfer）今住巴黎、他對於一切的造型美術都感着興味、有時作畫有時又從事彫塑、而且有時也努力於搆成照相的實騐、</p>
<p>他在一千九百二十二年的作品中、有一張呌做「羣像」的雖然不能値得分外的推奬、但描出在巴黎的一班超現實主義詩人們這一點上、是饒有濃厚的興味的、十幾位各異其狀底詩人之外、還有彫刻化的奇利可和拉發愛爾等也被描在這一羣裏面、</p>
<p>他不單賦有畫家的天禀、且具有做版畫家的優秀才能、一九二二年在巴黎曾把「陳習」「永遠的不幸」二版畫集、卷首附了Eluard　Paul的序刋行於世、最近又有題名「自然史」的畫集出版、這畫集附有達達派詩人阿兒普的序、蒐羅幻想的自然創造史底秦描寫眞版三十四張、這作品極其印象的、裏面有一張「人間之眼」、顯微鏡的地、擴大而描出人間的眼睛、這該說是他發見了前人未曾踏過底藝術的領域、他的銳感性已成功了開拓這樣的新境地、</p>
<p>總以爲評他此外的作品爲着想奇警、倒無寗說是荒唐無稽爲適切吧、然而、在那裏、足使我們驚嘆其夢幻的世界是何等地廣闊呵、</p>
<p>彌羅西班牙人、是一位明快的抒情畫家、他的熱情像烈火般的熾熱、他的愛心像蜂蜜般的甜美、因而、彌羅的想像恰似月夜的神秘、但其表現却如白晝的明晳、彌羅的抒情的才能和超現實的精神融合做一起、是夠能奏出一曲可驚的SurRealisme的音樂來的、他喜歡描寫眼前的勞動世界作品有「旅館」「家族」馬戲團」等</p>
<p>瑪遜的爲人、好像小枝的新芽、被誘惑於春風而招展、雖然他的作品没有愛倫斯特的眞實、但總離不了是柔軟的而且又是夢幻的、他的作風常有法蘭西的感覺、很能和George　Braque的相像、如「室内的裸婦」「小刀」「魚之爭」等作品中、都帶有柔軟的粘性的、</p>
<p>超現實主義的代表作家除奇利可（Giorgio　de　Cbirico)愛倫斯特（Max　Ernst)彌羅（Joan　Miro）瑪遜（Andre　Masson)等之外、還有達爾斯科（Dablskog）丹就（Yyos　Tanguy）、辟加比亞（Francis　Picabia)和德國的華德（Spios　Walter）明息（Ｍensean）美國的曼·雷（Ｍ　Ray）等中堅份子、</p>
<p>暫在考慮時期、隠約有超現實主義底同情的傾向、而被目爲超現實主義的名譽會員者有辟加索（Pablo　Plcasso）勃拉克（Goorges　Braque）和苦萊（Ｐaul　Klee)等三人、前兩人是立體派的先鋒、後者是表現派殘存的猛將、三人固著聲譽於現代藝術界者、然時代背景的推移、影響而摇撼其固有的根基、也是必然的事、</p>
<p>這篇貧弱的介紹、謹獻於熱心新興藝術的朋友、</p>
<h3 id="c173">蒂賽圖案畫展 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>

<p>蒂賽圖案社是西湖藝專圖案系諸君所組織、他們不僅在技巧上下死工夫、而且企求在中國這塊荒野裏探尋出圖案的新途徑、對圖案理論下一番努力的探研、</p>
<p>東方（中國）的圖案在世界藝壇上有過光榮的歷史、現在却衰落了、而近世西方機械文明、又春潮般向東土奔來、因此國貨遂以粗劣笨拙遭人排斥、這原因雖由於中國經濟的落後、然而缺乏美的圖案不能組織完好的貨物和外貨競爭也是實事、那麽、如果我們欲提高國際間的經濟地位、與美化大衆的生活、就非附帶提倡圖案以發展機械工業不可、蒂賽社諸君所以肯苦心孤詣地來組織圖案社及舉行展覽會、想一定已毅然地把這種重大的使命加在他們自己的肩上去、而且企望引起國内大衆之注意圖案的、</p>
<p>再是、如上所說圖案是伴着物質文明而愈加發展的藝術、所以牠是愈加隨着都市的演進成爲功利的實用的東西、這次蒂賽展覽會件件都是實用器物的設計、而且在他們作品中線條和色彩的表現、者看得出他們修養的老練、在許多方面爲中國圖案尋找出了一個新的方向、</p>
<p>自然在一切藝術都落後的中國、荒僻的圖案是更加不易爲人認識的吧、不過這種實用藝術總是在隨着社會的演進而發展着、所以開掘的工作都希望國内諸圖案家、尤其是蒂賽圖案社諸君繼續的努力、完成這種事業了、</p>
<p>最後以誠意介紹給大衆參觀這個圖案展、因爲在荒蕪的中國的圖案界確算得一點可貴的收獲、</p>
<p>附註、蒂賽圖案展、由本月三日至六日在南京路國貨商塲舉行四天、</p>

<h3 id="c175">詩人的搬家 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 默之</p>
<p>搬家本來是很平常的一件事、没有什麽記述的必要、但是詩人的搬家、與普通的一般人的所謂搬家却大有不同、有如其中别含有一種値得咀嚼的風趣、是美化的、藝術化的、甚至可以說是饒有詩意的、在此要伸述的、這次並不是我自己的搬家、是我這個不會做事的人帮助震動文壇的×詩人移居、因爲我、對於這些事素來就是「門外漢」、所以獨居在江灣的一個小小紅樓的一角、已經有三個多年頭了、和我同居在一起的朋友們、都先後由這紅樓而遷移到别處去了、祇有我、紅樓大有依依不捨之意、在另一方面說、搬家也很需要經濟的、我因爲欠房東老板的租費太多、爲了這一種外人不能知道的牽制、所以我將「喬遷」這回事已經深深地丢在臘後去了、實際、也可以說是我素性於懶惰、所謂懶惰的人、當然是不大喜動的、因此我覺得搬家是勤勞的人所喜做的工作了、</p>
<p>嘗有朋友打趣的問我、「默、你住在這老窠裏要到什麽時候爲止、我看你從未搬過一次家、這倒怪有趣的呢、」</p>
<p>我、老是本着我的常態、淡淡地回答他們、「大槪要等到這裏卒業了吧、但我覺得、這四年的光陰是很容易消逝的呢」</p>
<p>朋友們、仍是懐疑着在說、「不見得那麽你明年暑期卒業、不是要搬家了嗎、看你或許會繼續住下去……」</p>
<p>「這倒不會、」我搶着答、「所謂大學畢業、雖然是無用、但是生活的維持總很重要的、我是個窮困的靑年、不但要設法找一處比較安定的吃飯的地方、並且還要顧及家庭、我的一身生活的擔子是如此的重、當然不能守坐着這老窠、不去求謀新的發展眞的談及搬家就要引起前途渺茫的傷感、所以、我底一顆懦弱的心、是希望永久不搬家的……」</p>
<p>關於這等事、我是和朋友們常談着的、這次、我所敬愛的乙詩人、他爲遷移、竟跑來找到我、雖然我是不長於此、但是以友情的關係也是義不容辭的、於是、我很高興的答應了他、</p>
<p>詩人的喜於藝術化、是極形顯明的事實、我所敬愛的乙詩人、當然也逃不出此例、當他搬家的一天中午、我獨自一人很興高采烈的跑到他那裏、—天通庵一座小樓上、祇見他和平常一樣的笑嘻嘻地坐着、嘴裏也是照常在囌哩囌嚕地哼着、大槪是在吟詩吧、他見了我來、充滿了喜悅地立起來和我握手、我也在悲愁的面　上破顔了、</p>
<p>「東西怎麽還是這樣散漫、今天搬家嗎、」我含疑的問、</p>
<p>「搬的馬馬虎虎好了、」他說了、接着是一陣慣常的富有詩意的笑聲、</p>
<p>「偉大的詩人…藝術化…」我這樣地讚美着、</p>
<p>「嘻…嘻…嘻…」他又喚發着詩人的笑、</p>
<p>我是瘦弱如柴一般、實在没有氣力來做比較重的事、這回也祇有破例、和他兩人打舖蓋、理零星物件、結果還是不十分整齊、弄得手忙脚亂、不知所措、但是注視這些我們算是整理過的物件終覺得是充滿了神秘的詩意、他自己祇以爲把一那比生命還寳貴的詩稿深深地藏在皮箱裏之外、其餘的物件差不多都不是在他心目中所謂珍貴之品了、</p>
<p>眞的、詩人祇有自己哼出來的詩是寳貴的、</p>
<p>於是、我們很經濟的所謂一般民衆所吃的那種上海灘人呌做的「陽春麫、」因爲稍稍地幹了一些事、腹裏也忘記了餓了、但是我們吃完這碗麫、終不能明白這生活是「平民化」還是「詩化、」</p>
<p>搬塲汽車來了、就把我們和詩人自己的一切什物都載到法租界某馬路、這就他新居的處所、同居如李君張君、都是當今文壇上有聲譽的人、而且這裏的地方很幽靜、如果創制文藝作品、尤其是詩眞是再適宜没有的了、我誠懇地說、「乙詩人、你今後當更有偉大的詩篇貢獻給中國文壇吧、」他祇是微笑、富有詩意的微笑顯現在他的圓圓的臉上了、</p>
<p>隨便地替他把牀舖好、我們兩人辭别了李君的賢淑的史夫、人和正着手編輯當日即須出版的晚報的張君、就徘徊在幽靜的馬路上了、我才明白、搬家原來就是這麽一回事、</p>
<p>這時已有三點多鐘、我們都感覺腹中有些餓、他說我今天爲了他搬家而太勞苦了、要邀我到北四川路一家我們幾個流浪的孤獨者所常來的一家酒樓上小吃一下、藉此也可以暢談許多我們所要說的話、我爲了難却詩人的盛意、也祗有誠心地高興地又來叨擾他了、</p>
<p>我們很悵然的、是未曾遇見靑年們所敬愛的包君不然、我們的談鋒更要健些、但是這天、我們兩人一直談到七點多鐘才離開了這値得留戀的茶室、因酒後、又沉醉於神秘的北四川路上的夜裏了、</p>
<p>在這時、我們除了窺視各種店裏的陳列物之外、對於路上的女人是决不有勇氣的去加以鑑賞、雖然、詩人有時是沉醉的愛之網裏、但是我們都是孤獨者、談起愛、就要引起無限的傷心、這尤其是我祷樣流浪海上舉目無親的人、照了照自己一副憔悴的面孔、也不像一個有希望追求於愛、還是努力於當前的事業、以求國家民族、與及自己整個的發展、想到此、所謂靑年們所急迫需要的愛的歡念也無形打消了、某詩人、當然比我幸福得多、玲瓏可喜听未婚妻在姑蘇求讀、來往的信札都是快遞、是很値得在我這個孤獨的流浪者面前驕傲的呢、</p>
<p>徘徊許久、覺得心中有些悵然、於是我和詩人握手而别回到江灣、已經九點多鐘、了但因心緒麻亂、這裏還有多量所謂富有詩意的事都未曾儘情地叙述、有時候、詩人的本性實在太變態、而且又是使我們說不出所以然的、我祗覺得、「詩人是偉大的」、</p>

<h3 id="e36">Small Changes in Political Parties of Various Countries <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>A country cannot be defeated from abroad. The result will inevitably be internal strife. Observing the end of the European War, revolutions in most countries are proof of this. The same is true for political parties. In countries with multiple political parties, the powerful political party's regime is either overthrown by the party or fails to overthrow other parties and restore power. The result will inevitably be internal strife. Taking the powerful political parties in various countries as an example, the British Conservative Party cannot defeat the ruling party. Churchill, a powerful member of the party, resigned from the Finance Committee of the party to show his disagreement with Chairman Baldwin. The Japanese Seiyukai cannot defeat the ruling party, so there is a movement to change the party's internal organization. The same is true for the German National Socialist Party. The so-called "stormtroopers" could not achieve their goals, so they split. In all these cases, the frustrated political parties in various countries are in this situation. The original intention of having political parties in various countries was to seize political power to promote the party's policies. Therefore, if the party's policies cannot be implemented, it is better to abandon political power to let the enemy party do it. Now this meaning is somewhat forgotten, and they often want to use the party's policies as a call to seize political power. After political power is obtained, it is not important whether the policies are implemented. Therefore, frustrated political parties cannot obtain political power and are no different from defeated countries, resulting in internal dissatisfaction and internal strife. This is also a noteworthy event in the changing history of political parties in the world.</p>

<p>Political Future Appears Uncertain</p>
<p>Party Prepares to Nominate a New President</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – Prime Minister Hamaguchi was originally scheduled to be admitted to the hospital at 5:00 PM yesterday, but due to insufficient preparations, it was delayed until after 7:00 PM when an ambulance from the Imperial University finally arrived. At 8:15 PM, the emaciated Prime Minister, supported by his wife and close relatives, exited the doorway and boarded the patient transport vehicle to the Imperial University Hospital. The vehicle traveled slowly at ten miles per hour. At 8:45 PM, it arrived at the Imperial University Hospital and he was readmitted to Room 12, exactly seventy-four days after his initial hospitalization.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – Prime Minister Hamaguchi was readmitted to the hospital and originally scheduled for surgery this morning. The hospital preponed the procedure to midnight, first administering "Dantopon" in preparation for surgery. After injecting "Ringer's" solution, the Prime Minister was moved to the operating room. Doctors Manabe, Mizobuchi, and Inada also participated. Under the bright lights, Dr. Shiota performed the surgery at 1:00 AM, completing it in just thirty minutes. At 1:45 AM, he was returned to his room. The post-operative progress is excellent, with minimal blood loss, so a transfusion was not necessary.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – After performing surgery on Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Dr. Shiota announced the surgical procedure at 2:00 AM as follows: After injecting "Dantopon," local anesthesia was administered. At precisely 1:00 AM, a two-inch incision was made in the upper left abdomen, and the expected adhesions were separated. During the surgery, the Prime Minister said his head itched and asked permission to scratch it, maintaining his usual demeanor. The surgery was extremely successful.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – Although somewhat fatigued after surgery, Prime Minister Hamaguchi's abdominal pain has subsided, and he is resting peacefully. Only his wife, Natsuko, remains at his side to care for him. The other close relatives have returned home. Doctors Shiota, Manabe, and Mizobuchi also returned to their quarters at 4:00 AM this morning to rest. Prime Minister Hamaguchi awoke at 8:30 AM this morning and was examined by Dr. Shiota at 9:30 AM. His temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, pulse was 90, and respiration was 15. He drank a small amount of Bancha tea and requested that Mrs. Natsuko read the newspaper to him, but the doctors forbade it. Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara, Army Minister Kazushige Ugaki, Colonial Affairs Minister Matsuda, and other party executives filled the guest room, causing a hubbub.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – Although the Japanese government feigns optimism regarding Prime Minister Hamaguchi's second surgery, they are deeply concerned about whether he can recover quickly given his current weakened state. They may even have to make major decisions. Therefore, they harbor internal anxieties about the future of the political situation. Prime Minister Hamaguchi himself is also considering all possibilities. Yesterday, he specifically summoned Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara and Railway Minister Eki Hiroshi to his residence, engaging in quiet conversation for one hour from noon. Interior Minister Adachi Kenzō also conferred with the Prime Minister for an hour from 4:00 PM, discussing all political and party affairs during his hospitalization.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – Masataka Chūno and Yamaji Sōichi visited Interior Minister Adachi Kenzō last night at 10:00 PM to inquire about Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition. During the meeting, Chūno stated that it would be inconsiderate to trouble Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who is so ill. He should be placed in a position of leisure to recuperate, and the party should establish a new president to cope with the situation. He believed that the Seiyūkai party would not seize political power due to the change of president. Adachi Kenzō did not give a clear answer to this, but he deeply harbored concerns about Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition. Many within the party share the same opinion as Chūno. Close attention should be paid to how this faction will act in the future.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – With Prime Minister Hamaguchi's re-hospitalization, there are various maneuvers within the party regarding the issue of a successor. Candidates include advisor Yamamoto Tatsuo, Wakatsuki Reijirō, Interior Minister Adachi Kenzō, and Army Minister Kazushige Ugaki. Among them, Yamamoto Tatsuo, due to his cordial relations with figures such as [　　], is considered likely to extend the life of the cabinet if elected president. Therefore, there is a considerable number supporting Yamamoto. The Adachi faction believes that they should not cling to power and advocate for a complete resignation, nominating Interior Minister Adachi Kenzō as president and Railway Minister Eki Hiroshi as vice president, hoping to stage a comeback in the future. As for advisor [機] [顧問], due to the complex situation, it may be difficult to achieve consensus. Army Minister Kazushige Ugaki also faces internal party discord, making it difficult to become a reality. In short, the party cannot avoid considering the issue of a president.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 4th – According to recent reports in newspapers in Prague and Paris, there are secret clauses in the German-Austrian Customs Union, or a separate political alliance exists outside the economic treaty. The official here has stated that this report is completely fabricated, and the intention is very clear. Local newspapers further state that there is a background to the recent opposition to the German-Austrian Customs Union, namely the naval arms reduction treaty. Although the parties involved have exaggerated and vigorously promoted it, making people believe that it has been successful, the key points are still shelved for further discussion.

<h3 id="e50">British Economic Mission Drafting Report <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – During his visit to Liverpool, Sir Ernest Thompson, leader of the economic mission, told a Reuters reporter that they will be drafting powerful recommendations to submit to the government. He also stated that the members spend twelve hours a day drafting the report. One representative said that the report is not only interesting but also startling. It is expected that the team's findings on cotton sales will provide Lancashire with a more detailed truth. Mr. Bell, secretary of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Unions, is very concerned about the unfavorable situation in Lancashire, but he strongly refutes the claim that "China has factories, produces cotton in the back door, and produces cloth in the front door," which has caused unrest in Lancashire. The Department of Overseas Trade wrote to Sir Ernest Thompson, stating that the British government is closely monitoring the progress of the mission's work, and is deeply concerned, from the mission's own reports and the reports from British representatives in China and Japan, as well as the news reports. They know that their work is very difficult, but they are handling it very well. Sir Ernest Thompson also told the Reuters reporter that all possible measures have been taken in China and Japan to facilitate the work of the mission. If the mission had not had this assistance, it would not have been able to complete its work in time, but now it can submit a report to the government immediately. When the reporter asked if the mission's report would benefit Manchester, Thompson replied that Manchester seemed to be in adverse circumstances. Since the mission left the country, things have been deteriorating daily. The cotton report will be prepared separately and will not be included in the general report. Mr. Dukesbury, former chairman of the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Unions, said that he hoped that as a result of their work, a new path of progress could be opened up for Lancashire. Mr. Edmonson, secretary of the Printing Workers' Union, said that the main difficulty Lancashire faced in the Eastern market was the price issue. Another team member, Mr. Green, said that Japanese cotton mills are not better equipped than Lancashire cotton mills. In his opinion, the only difference is in the workers.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th – Although here it is the Easter holiday, the internal divisions of the National Socialist Party and the political situation are still undergoing heated changes. Stormtroop leader Stennes recently declared that he would organize newspapers to promote his independent views, but he has no intention of organizing a new party for the time being. Because he claims that his party members are enough to represent the ideals of the National Socialist Party and are still loyal National Socialist Party members. Furthermore, Stennes will convene several meetings after Easter. When asked about his future economic plans, they are confident that there will soon be a good strategy to deal with this problem. However, the members of the stormtroopers are mostly from the unemployed people and the children of the post-war disaster area, so the economic problem is a difficult problem for them to solve.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Incident of Japanese Navy Committing Murder in Hankou Escalates <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Injured Ni Zhaomei Dies</p>
<p>Municipal Government Presents Three Conditions to Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Ni Zhaomei, a Chinese national, being shot by the Japanese Navy stationed in Hankou, the Hankou Municipal Government lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul on the 3rd, and conditions were being discussed. Unexpectedly, Ni died at 1:30 AM on the 4th at the Tongrenhui Hospital due to his severe injuries. The negotiations thus escalated. The Municipal Government has now presented three conditions, and the diplomatic inspector of the five provinces, Zhou Zechun, is personally negotiating with the Japanese Consul. Whether a smooth resolution can be achieved is still uncertain. The latest developments in the case are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Ni Zhaomei Dies from Severe Injuries: Ni Zhaomei was injured on the morning of the 1st and was sent to the Japanese Concession Tongrenhui Hospital for treatment. At 4:00 PM, the hospital's doctor examined him in detail. The bullet entered from the left side of the waist and exited from the left side of the abdomen, with a small entry wound and a large exit wound. Although the injured person was unconscious, bleeding profusely, the doctor still believed he could be treated. He then used X-rays to examine the interior and stated that the abdominal bones were not severely damaged. He immediately issued a diagnosis certificate, which was signed and witnessed by a Japanese Navy translator. The thirteenth district director, Wan Dixiu, participated in the examination. He sent the hospital diagnosis certificate and the Japanese Navy translator's signature to the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Government for record. Unexpectedly, his condition worsened and worsened until 1:30 AM on the 4th, when he died from his injuries. Ni was 36 years old, extremely poor, and worked as a farmer.</p>
<p>Hankou Court Examines the Corpse: After Ni Zhaomei died, his younger brothers Ni Dongshan and Ni Zhenfang reported it to the thirteenth district. Director Wan immediately went to investigate and sent a letter to the Hankou District Court, requesting that it send someone to examine the body. At this time, Japanese Consul Tanaka also heard the news and rushed to the scene. Wan immediately made an informal statement to the Japanese Consul, stating that the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. He also stated to the deceased's relatives that he was willing to report to the authorities on their behalf and properly arrange for the funeral expenses and subsequent negotiations. The deceased's relatives agreed. After the prosecutor Liao Yuanxiang, dispatched by the court, conducted the examination, the body was temporarily taken away, awaiting government negotiations. Director Wan then went to the Municipal Government and reported the incident to Mayor Liu Wendao.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Visits Mayor Liu: Japanese Consul-General Sakane Junzo (Tanaka), after receiving a report from the Tongrenhui Hospital, went to the Municipal Government with Vice-Consul Takai Suehiko at 10:00 AM to visit Mayor Liu Wendao. He personally described the incident and reported that Ni had died. He expressed great regret for this unfortunate incident, but said that the incident was not intentional by the Japanese Navy and asked for forgiveness. Mayor Liu immediately replied to the Consul that the Japanese Navy's armed crossing of the border, whether it was for target practice or hunting, whether intentional or unintentional, was a disregard for China's sovereignty and a contempt for Chinese lives. The Japanese side should be responsible. The Japanese Consul then left.</p>
<p>Presenting Conditions Such as Punishing the Culprit: After the Japanese Consul left, Mayor Liu immediately invited the five-province inspection commissioner Zhou Zechun to the government office and consulted with Secretary-General He Fuzhou, etc. In addition to immediately instructing the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to investigate the situation as soon as possible and submit a report, they decided to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Consul. The conditions were: (1) Severely punish the murderer, (2) Provide generous compensation, and (3) Issue a formal apology. As for the issue of Japanese troops using live ammunition for target practice, because Japanese troops have done this in many parts of China in the past, they sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about how to negotiate and stop it. After the conditions were determined, it was 2:00 PM, and Commissioner Zhou Zechun went to visit the Japanese Consul for the first formal negotiation. It is reported that the Japanese Consul has given considerable answers to the requests made (April 4th).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Xu Yuanquan Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Yuanquan, director of bandit suppression and rural pacification in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, had to report to Director He of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters on the situation of bandit suppression in western Hubei. On the 2nd of this month, he traveled down from the Shashi defense area on the Wuhu small steamer and arrived in Hankou on the morning of the 4th. The 10th Army's office in Hankou received Xu's departure telegram and sent a Feilong small steamship to meet him. Before reaching Jinkou, it encountered the Wuhu steamer, so they traveled east together downstream. At about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, it arrived at Wharf No. 1 in Hankou. After Xu landed, he greeted the welcomers with a wave and took a car to the Third Army Group Headquarters to report to Director He on the bandit suppression situation in western Hubei and asked for instructions. Then, he visited Li Mingzhong, Liu Wendao, Wu Xingya, Xia Douyin, and former acquaintances in Hankou. In the afternoon, he returned to the 10th Army office in Hankou to rest. I then submitted my card and visited him at this time. I was received and had the following conversation: (Q) Western Hubei has been ravaged by the Red bandits for a long time. After your army's vigorous suppression, Jianli, Shishou, Tiaoxian, Hefeng, and Wufeng have been successively recovered. Has the remaining bandits been cleared? Xu (A) Since the various departments of our army have worked hard to suppress the Red bandits in western Hubei, both sides of the Yangtze River have been cleared. The scattered remnants of bandits lurking in various places have also been assigned teams to annihilate them. Now there is no problem with bandit suppression there. (Q) What is the situation of rural pacification in western Hubei now? (A) Since I took office as Director, I have ordered all counties in western Hubei and their subordinate troops to establish Rural Pacification Committees. Now the first step of rural pacification is underway, such as surveying the population and implementing Baojia, which are all being actively carried out. (Q) How was the inspection along the way on Director's trip to Hankou? (A) On this trip back to Hankou, I personally went ashore to inspect Tiaoguan, Chewan, and other places in Shishou to examine the discipline of our army and give instructions on methods to strictly protect the local area. Now Tiaoguan has built extremely solid fortifications to prevent bandits from returning from the border of Hunan. (Q) What is the situation in Jingzhou and Shashi? (A) Jingzhou and Shashi are very peaceful, and business is also quite prosperous, which is very different from when I first arrived. (Q) After Director visits Director He in Hankou, will you need to go to Beijing? (A) I will not stay elsewhere for the time being. I will stay in Hankou for a while and then return to my defense area. At this point, I excused myself and left (April 4th).</p>
<h3 id="e63">Mutiny in Luchuan Resolved <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The remnants of the mutineers in Changzhi fled east and disturbed the vicinity of Lingchuan. According to telegram reports from division commanders Yang Xiaou and Yan Shi, the Lingchuan mutiny was suppressed after troops were sent to pursue and suppress them. Lingchuan was recovered on March 29, and the remaining bandits fled to the towns near the city. Troops are still being sent to pursue and suppress them, and it is expected that it will be cleared soon. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) "It is reported by Lv Chaoran, battalion commander of the Wang Sitian regiment under my command, that after I was ordered to vigorously suppress the remnants of the bandits in Lingchuan and arrived at Pingcheng Town, north of Lingchuan, I led my troops to Lingchuan at 10:00 PM on the afternoon of the reconnaissance. We reached the destination at 1:30 AM and carried out a vigorous suppression. At 2:00 AM, we captured Butterfly Mountain. The bandits were unable to resist and fled to the towns near the city. Dozens of bandits were killed. Lingchuan has now been recovered. In addition to tracking and pursuing them to the towns near the city, I am sending a telegram to report. I have ordered the battalion commander to quickly pursue and suppress them so that they can be cleared as soon as possible to secure the countryside and report their merits. I respectfully report." (2) "The situation of Lv Chaoran's battalion of the Wang Sitian regiment of my command, defeating the remnants of bandits in the city of Lingchuan and tracking them to the towns near the city, has been reported in the telegrams. In addition to ordering Lv battalion commander to supervise the troops and Jiang's regiment and Hao's battalion to quickly annihilate them and prevent them from spreading, I respectfully report first."</p>
<p>According to other news, the mutineers in Changzhi and Jiangxian are still being dealt with. According to a person from Pianguan County, a company of the security team stationed in the county also mutinied a few days ago and fled to the border with weapons. The Yang Yaofang army stationed in Qixian has not been very bad since it arrived, and the local people are living in peace as always. Unexpectedly, a small part (about dozens of people) of the county town garrison suddenly fled to Wenshui County with weapons. The army division headquarters received the news and immediately sent a large battalion to pursue them. The fleeing soldiers looted every village in Wenshui County. Because they had not gone far, they were caught up by the troops sent to pursue them. The mutineers were surrounded, and both sides exchanged fire for several hours. As a result, except for a few soldiers who escaped, they have all been dealt with. The ringleader was captured and, after interrogation, was shot outside the south gate of the county. (March 31)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Liaoning Provincial Government Makes Great Efforts to Maintain Banknotes <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Recalling Provincial Banknotes and Reorganizing the Provincial Bank</p>
<p>Urging the Central Government to Approve Financial Public Bonds</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the provincial banknotes plummeted repeatedly a few days ago, society has been quite uneasy. Each silver dollar once exchanged for more than three yuan and three jiao in banknotes. Subsequently, the provincial government made great efforts to maintain the value, on the one hand, implementing crackdowns on small money stalls along the streets, and on the other hand, ordering banks and various silver firms and money shops to cooperate. Only in the past two days has the market gradually recovered, with each yuan rising from over three yuan back to two yuan eight or nine jiao. Officials have been negotiating for days and decided on several methods of raising funds, and the funds raised in the future will be used exclusively for recalling provincial banknotes. As for the method of recalling, it will be done through secretly buying at market prices. At the same time, the official fixed minimum price is expected to be no less than 40% of the face value. Together with the provincial banknotes withdrawn for monthly cash redemption, they will be burned and destroyed. In the future, the required military expenses, in addition to requesting assistance from Deputy Commander Zhang, will have to be obtained through other means and will no longer be borrowed from the provincial bank.</p>
<p>As for the provincial bank, officials recently plan to attract commercial shares for reorganization due to its excessive debts, and it will still be jointly operated by officials and merchants. Branch offices will be established in each county, guaranteed by the chamber of commerce. First-class counties will issue 500,000 yuan of banknotes, second-class counties will issue 400,000 yuan of banknotes, and third-class counties will issue 300,000 yuan of banknotes, using the newly issued banknotes to absorb the old provincial banknotes. Some people also advocate using foreign capital to exploit mineral resources, borrowing some foreign capital first for the purpose of reorganizing the provincial banknotes. However, this plan is still under close discussion.</p>
<p>Recently, Shang Zhen, in order to earnestly request the central government to approve the issuance of Shanxi Financial Public Bonds, telegraphed the central government and Deputy Commander Zhang. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) "Urgent, Nanjing Executive Yuan, I respectfully request that the case of reorganizing Shanxi Financial Public Bonds, which I requested to be restored, was previously opened by the Office of Civil Servants and sent to your court for handling, etc. I am extremely grateful for the central government's deep concern for Shanxi Province. Recently, businessmen and people in Shanxi Province, because this public bond has not yet been clearly restored by decree, rumors have arisen, and the price of provincial banknotes has plummeted. Upon investigation, Shanxi Province's currency is unified, and there is nothing else that can replace provincial banknotes. With the price of banknotes being low and the price of goods rising, the daily life of the people has been affected. Moreover, after the reorganization of the army, there is still no source of income for the salaries. Although the province is勉struggling to raise rations, the amount is small and the value is low, insufficient to provide a full meal. The military and civilians are in a state of panic, with a sense of impending doom. I earnestly implore your court to consider the critical situation in Shanxi Province and approve the issuance of the aforementioned financial public bonds as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. I am overwhelmed with anticipation. Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, respectfully kowtows." (2) "Urgent, Shenyang Deputy Commander Zhang, I have received your confidential telegram. The price of provincial banknotes in Shanxi Province has plummeted in recent days, and the value is already below 30% of face value. The military and civilians are in a state of panic, with a sense of impending doom. Although the reasons for this are complex, the main reason is that the method of military pay has not been determined, and the provincial banknotes have no guarantee. Now that the reorganization loan has been compromised, I earnestly request that you immediately order the remittance of funds. With these funds to regulate the market in Taiyuan, the price of banknotes may be stabilized. Furthermore, in order to maintain the provincial banknotes, I telegraphed the central government on the Qing Day of last month, requesting that the reorganization of Shanxi Financial Public Bonds of 24 million yuan be approved for restoration. This case has been submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan for handling. I earnestly implore Your Excellency to urge the Executive Yuan to approve the issuance as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. I am overwhelmed with anticipation. Shang Zhen respectfully kowtows." (March 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Question of the Jiaoji Railway Building the Daoji Branch Line <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaoji Railway Plans to Build to Linqing First</p>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Government Will Also Make Suggestions to the Central Government</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the extension of the Jiaoji Railway to Daokou, Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, is currently in Beijing for negotiations and has already obtained the consent of the Ministry of Railways. According to Mr. Ge, the Jiaoji Railway currently has only more than 400 kilometers, but it has a huge debt of 40 million Japanese yen. If revenue is not increased, I am afraid that it will still not be redeemed when the deadline expires. This will not only result in the loss of rights and interests but also be looked down upon internationally. Therefore, extending to the most suitable Daokou is indeed necessary. However, extending from Jinan to Daokou is a total of 300 kilometers, and there is no such huge amount of money available for the time being. It is now planned to be divided into three phases. The first phase is to build to Linqing first, which is about 100 kilometers long, and is estimated to require 7 million yuan. According to the planned plan, the steel rails freed up by this road can be laid, which can save half of the cost, and only 3.5 million yuan needs to be raised through bonds to be sufficient for use. After the first phase of the extension line is completed, business will commence, and the income from the business will be used to continue to build the second and third phases. If the entire Daoji line is completed, then this road will be more than 700 kilometers long, and it will be able to issue 40 million in public bonds to redeem this road at once. However, this matter is of great importance and depends entirely on the efforts of the people, etc. Furthermore, today (the 3rd) at the Shandong Provincial Government's regular meeting, Wang Fangting, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, also proposed the construction of the Daoji Railway. It has been resolved to submit it to the central government for approval. The proposal is recorded as follows: "For the proposal, revitalizing local industries and promoting social prosperity are not limited to one end. The development of transportation agencies is the most urgent task. Based on my limited understanding, the construction of the Daoji Railway is a crucial plan for this province. Upon investigation, Daokou Town in Weihui, Henan, is located on the south bank of the Wei River, connecting Jixian to the west, Tianjin to the north, and more than 400 miles east of Jinan. In the past, it was an important route for transporting grains from Yan, Lu, and Yu. The people of Shandong benefited greatly from the goods transported from Daokou to Shandong. Since the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways were successively created, the commercial transport between Lu and Yu has taken a roundabout turn, and the prosperity between Daokou and Jinan is no longer what it used to be. Now, if a railway is built from Daokou to Jinan, it will connect a horizontal line in the middle of the two vertical lines of the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, making transportation between Lu and Yu direct. Moreover, it will connect the Daoji Railway with the Daoqing Railway. The convenience of this is self-evident. Furthermore, Daokou is adjacent to Zhangde and Xinxiang, which are also strategically important places. Once this road is opened, its impact will not only be related to the industrial prosperity of Shandong. It is proposed that the provincial government submit a request to the central government, ordering the Ministry of Railways and the Construction Committee to send personnel to survey, establish a plan, and implement it quickly. The local area will be very fortunate." (April 3rd)</p>

According to statistics, the total monthly expense is about 350,000 yuan. In addition, the soldiers and troops of Yang Hanlie, Chen Heling, Yang Jianming, Yu Cai, and Zhuo Desheng are also earnestly requesting to be incorporated. It is said that the Security Department intends to approve them all. (April 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Newly Established Seven Counties in Qinghai <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Qinghai is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, bordering Gansu to the northeast, Sichuan, Xikang, and Tibet to the south, and Xinjiang to the west. It covers a vast area of approximately 2.49 million square miles, with a population of approximately one million. The mountains and rivers are closely connected, and the terrain is completely secure. The climate is extremely cold and hot, and the products are abundant, and breeding is quite rapid. Last month, Wang Yutang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the province, submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior to add seven counties, namely, Gonghe, Manyuan, Tongren, Huzhu, Minhe, Yushu, and Dulan, due to the vast territory of Qinghai, the gradual increase in population, the excessively large jurisdiction of the old counties, and the inconvenience of administration. The Ministry of Interior has submitted the request to the Executive Yuan, which was approved at the 17th State Council meeting on the 24th of last month, allowing the establishment. The boundaries of the newly established counties are investigated as follows: Gonghe County, east to Jiangla·Luoyi Village, connecting Xining·Bayen, west to Qieji·Duoerma Sheep Bend, connecting Dahe Dam, south to the Yellow River, connecting Guide, northeast to Riyue Mountain·Laji Mountain, connecting Xining, northwest to Wenbozhai·Shijia Mountain, bordering Qinghai. The north-south distance is more than 120 li, and the east-west distance is more than 310 li.</p>
<p>Manyuan County, the east is bounded by the Laerjia Mountain Ridge and Yongdeng County, Gansu, the west is bounded by Babao Mountain, the south is bounded by Dasaka Mountain and Datong, the north is bounded by Daxue Mountain and Shiliangzhou, Gansu, and the southeast is bounded by Tangritou Mountain and the Ganchen Temple in Huzhu County. The north-south distance is more than 130 li, and the east-west distance is more than 380 li.</p>
<p>Tongren County, the Baoan Fort area under the jurisdiction of Xunhua County is vast and has a complex population. It is 140 li away from the seat of Xunhua County, and the rule is extremely inconvenient. Therefore, Tongren County was added.</p>
<p>Minhe County, the west side, (1) the dividing point of Laoya is set at the mouth of Lucao Gully. Hula Lotus Terrace east of the mouth is under the jurisdiction of Minhe, and the land west of the mouth is under the jurisdiction of Ledu.

<p>Based on the Spirit of the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>Seeking the Asian Cultural Revival Movement</p>
<p>Aims to Gather People from All Over the World</p>
<p>Organize the International of the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>Nanjing Express News: At 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, the Asian Cultural Association held its first general assembly at the Zhizhi Hall of the National Central University. The representatives attending the meeting included representatives from Goryeo, Taiwan, India, Siam, Annam, Burma, and Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places in China, as well as representatives from various organizations and guests, totaling more than 400 people. The presidium consisted of five people: Huang Shaomei, Tao Linying (China), Mingsheng (India), Li Shizhong (Goryeo), and Peng Ziming (Taiwan). Huang Shaomei, the chairman, gave an opening speech after the ceremony, followed by Tao Linying's report on the preparations, followed by reports from the representatives. Finally, the guests gave speeches, and then the election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the association began. A declaration, general regulations, and many important cases were passed on the spot. Finally, the meeting ended with slogans and photography. After the meeting, the representatives went to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to lay flowers and pay their respects. The chairman's opening speech and report are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Speech: Distinguished representatives, distinguished guests, fellow comrades, in the "vast and boundless" and "all-encompassing" universe, many star systems are brilliantly displayed. Among the many star systems, there is a solar system with the sun as its main body. Among the planets that revolve around the sun, there is the earth on which we humans live. On the earth, in the five continents, there is Asia. In the Zhizhi Hall of the National Central University in Nanjing, Republic of China, on April 5, 1931, the first general assembly of the Asian Cultural Association is being held. At this assembly, there are representatives of the Chinese people, representatives of the Indian people, representatives of the Korean people, representatives of the Taiwanese people, representatives of the Annamese people, and representatives of other oppressed peoples of Asia. Everyone is determined to promote Asian culture and develop Asian culture. Everyone is determined to seek independence and freedom for all peoples. Everyone is prepared to participate in and promote this great and arduous task with the full strength of each nation. In such an enthusiastic revolutionary atmosphere, we have infinite joy and infinite hope.</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives of the oppressed peoples, since the European Industrial Revolution, capitalists in Europe and the United States, possessing huge capital, applying scientific methods, and using new-style production mechanisms to exploit the wages earned by the majority of toiling masses in society through blood and sweat, have formed a situation in which a small number of capitalists monopolize all economic privileges and control all political power, thus becoming international capitalist imperialists. They control the tragic fate of the vast majority of human beings. They directly and indirectly carry out political, economic, and even cultural aggression against all small and weak nations. They boast of their own culture, but in reality, the essence of their culture is only material aggression. Their culture is simply a culture of "things" rather than a culture of "people." In the modern world, the culture of "things" has replaced the culture of "people." How painful and terrible this is!</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives, we have all been invaded by world capitalist imperialists. We are naturally very clear about the above facts, and the impression in our minds is naturally particularly profound. Let us take a look at what our Asian culture was like in the past. When Premier Sun Yat-sen traveled north alone, he detoured to Kobe, Japan, and gave a speech entitled Greater Asianism, in which he said, "Our Asia is the birthplace of the most ancient culture. Thousands of years ago, the people of Asia had already attained a very high level of culture." He also said, "Fundamentally speaking, European culture in the last hundred years is a scientific culture that emphasizes utilitarianism. When this culture is applied to human society, there is only material civilization, only airplanes and bombs, only foreign guns and cannons. It is simply a culture of force. Europeans have recently used this culture of force to oppress our Asia, so our Asia cannot progress. This culture that specializes in using force to oppress people is acting tyrannically. Therefore, European culture is a culture of tyranny. But we in the East have always looked down on the culture of tyranny. There is another culture that is better than the culture of tyranny. The essence of this culture is benevolence, righteousness, morality, and the way of the king. Therefore, Asian culture is a culture of the way of the king." Premier Sun's precise and thorough remarks, in dissecting European and Asian cultures, not only clearly exposed the weaknesses of European culture but also revealed the advantages and characteristics of Asian culture.</p>
<p>In Asia, not only the Chinese nation, which values loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, can represent Asian culture, but also the Indian nation's gentleness and intelligence, as well as the magnanimity and peace of other nations, everywhere express the characteristics of Asian culture. If we look through history, whether it is Chinese culture, Indian culture, Turkestan culture, or the entire Asian culture, all have supreme value and glory. These historical records give us ironclad examples.</p>
<p>Looking at it comparatively, European culture is a culture that makes the majority of people in the world groan in pain, a culture that has emerged in the last hundred years or so, a culture of "things," a culture of tyranny. Asian culture is a culture with the characteristics of liberating all oppressed nations, a culture with a long history and past glory, a culture of "people," a culture of the way of the king. Therefore, when we look at the people in the world who are suffering, when we look at the oppressed nations of Asia, we should use Asian culture to relieve the poverty of European culture. We should use Asian culture to resist European culture. The first step we should take is to promote Asian culture and develop Asian culture under this international organization of the Asian Cultural Association. We should further understand the Three Principles of the People established by Premier Sun, and everywhere make the happiness and equality of mankind the basis for cultural construction. This is precisely the synthesis of the great achievements of Asian culture to meet the modern environment. We should unanimously base ourselves on the principles of the Three Principles of the People, unite the nations of the world that treat each other equally, organize the international of the Three Principles of the People, revive Asian culture, and complete the great unity of the world.</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives, fellow comrades, I have spoken at length. Now, let me summarize a few important points below: (1) We should recognize that what conquers small and weak nations by force and inflicts cruelty on the entire human race is European culture, the savage and tyrannical culture of "things." (2) We should further recognize that what has the spirit of liberating oppressed nations and saving mankind from danger is Asian culture, the peaceful and royal culture of "people." (3) Our most recent efforts should be to promote Asian culture and develop Asian culture in order to resist the European savage and tyrannical culture of "things." (4) To revive Asian culture, to save oppressed nations, to liberate oppressed nations, and to relieve the suffering of all mankind, we can only do so by basing ourselves on the principles of the Three Principles of the People, uniting the nations of Asia and the world, organizing the national international of the Three Principles of the People, and taking on the responsibility of realizing the great unity of the world. Distinguished representatives, fellow comrades, our responsibilities are extremely heavy, our work is extremely arduous, and we should advance vigorously step by step with a spirit of sacrifice and a determination to fight. We believe that our final efforts will surely lead to final success. Let us work hard from now on and continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Report to all representatives and comrades, after a long period of hard work, the Asian Cultural Association has come to an end and is holding its inaugural meeting today. This is a very worthy celebration. It is a rare opportunity for representatives from all over the world to come here to attend the meeting and gather together. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report to you on the preparations for this association. The culture of the world today can be clearly seen as one that is a culture of "people," namely Asian culture, which speaks of the way of the king, and one that is a culture of "things," namely European culture, which speaks of the way of the hegemon. These two fundamentally conflicting and incompatible cultures have formed two different stages in the world. According to the current situation, it is said that the culture of people has been suppressed by the culture of things, that is, European culture suppresses Asian culture. However, from a theoretical point of view, Asian culture is the oldest and most beautiful culture in the world. It is not that we ourselves are exaggerating, but that no one with a little knowledge in European countries dares to deny it. However, we Asians have neglected it too much. We have not continued to carry forward the position and value of Asian culture in the world. We have only held onto the concept of conservatism, and as a result, it has become increasingly depressed. We feel that this danger is a major obstacle to the problem of Asian cultural revival. Therefore, there is a motivation to unite comrades from Asian countries to organize this association. Comrades from Asian countries can understand this principle as a matter of great pain, and they all have the same feeling. Therefore, they have risen up in response and organized branch offices and liaison offices everywhere. It is estimated that branch offices and liaison offices have been established in the South Seas Islands, Europe, America, Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India, Siam, Annam, Burma, etc. In China, there are Guangdong, Hankou, Shanghai, Peiping, etc. The total number of members is about 50,000. Recently, those who are enthusiastically joining have been coming one after another. This grand occasion has opened a new era of Asian national unity. This is something that can be reported to all representatives. I think all the representatives present today must be very happy. The purpose of today's first general assembly is, on the one hand, to take this opportunity to elect formal executive and supervisory committee members, so that they can truly shoulder the mission of this association and seek the development of its affairs. On the other hand, it is to understand the situation of branch offices in various places, to check the work of the past, to exchange opinions with each other, and to jointly seek the development of its affairs. At the same time, it is also to unite the strength of our Asian nations and to complete the world cultural revolution as the goal. It is hoped that all the representatives attending the meeting will contribute their opinions as much as possible to achieve perfection. However, the time for this preparation was very short, and the abilities of the comrades were limited. Perhaps there are some shortcomings in all the procedures. There may also be some shortcomings in the hospitality for the representatives. It is hoped that all the representatives will forgive and forgive.</p>

<p>Peng Jiqun Resigns as Director of the Construction Department to Focus on Party Affairs</p>
<p>The Duties of the Construction Department Are Concurrently Handled by Liu Heling, Director of the Department of Agriculture</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Peng Jiqun, Director of the Liaoning Construction Department, is skilled in engineering knowledge. Last year, when the Northeast opened Huludao Port, Zhang Xueliang knew of Peng's ability and ordered him to concurrently serve as Director of the Port Affairs Office, supervising the entire port project. Peng rushed between Shenyang and Huludao, taking care of both and making many plans. This time, the central government ordered Peng to be the Party Affairs Guidance Committee Member of Liaoning Province. Peng believed that the work of party affairs was important, and in order to focus on party affairs, he submitted a request to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to resign from his position as Director of the Construction Department. The request was approved by the Party Affairs Committee. The vacant position of Director of the Construction Department was ordered to be concurrently held by Liu Heling, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines. In order to facilitate command, the Construction Department was moved into the Department of Agriculture in Yijing Road to work. Preparations have been underway for several days and have already made some progress. The handover has also been completed. The Construction Department officially merged into the Department of Agriculture to work from April 1st. (April 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Change of Head of the Special Police Department of Harbin <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Bowen Yue promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff</p>
<p>Wang Ruihua Appointed as Successor</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Following the promotion of Bowen Yue, the head of the Special Police Department, to Deputy Chief of Staff, the vacant position has been filled by Wang Ruihua, recommended by the Northeast Political Committee and formerly the Director of Education at the Liaoning Main Campus of the Northeast Military Academy. The appointment was made by the Special District Executive Officer's Office. On the 31st, Wang arrived in Harbin from Shenyang with six staff members, and officially took office on April 1st. Many of the previous personnel have been replaced, except for those who are senior and experienced in police administration. New appointments include Hou Zhizhong as Secretary-General, Sun Puwen as Head of the Fourth Section, Yin Dongjiao as Head of the Fifth Section, Wang Ziqi as Director of the License Division, and Xu Rongjiu as Assistant Inspector-General. It is said that the heads of various bureaus and teams will also be replaced. Wang is currently 40 years old, a native of Guixi, Liaoning, now residing in Xingcheng. He graduated from the Wu Peifu Military Academy and served as a platoon and company commander in Xu Shuzheng's Border Defense Army. After the Zhili-Anhui War, he served as a deputy battalion commander in Wang Chengbin's 23rd Division. In the eleventh year, he returned to Fengtian, serving as an instructor in the Training Corps, a brigade commander of the Fourth Supplementary Brigade, a brigade commander of the 27th Brigade, a deputy army commander of the Ninth Army, a garrison commander of Koubei, and a deputy army commander of the Eighth Army. He was recently transferred from Director of Education at the Liaoning Main Campus of the Northeast Military Academy to Head of the Special Police Department. Before Wang was appointed as the head of the Special Police Department, Jia Wenqi, the former deputy head of the department, and Yu Jingtao, the deputy head of the Road Police Department, were the most active contenders. Their strengths were evenly matched, and neither was willing to give way. Unexpectedly, the result was that Wang got the position. In Harbin, there is a saying, "Director Jia was originally not fake (賈處長原來不假), and Yu was ambitious but lacked the strength (于有心而力未餘)," which is an interesting anecdote about the appointment of the head of the Special Police Department.

<h3 id="e72">Investigation into the Reduction of Freight Rates by the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Rates Still Higher Than Chinese Railways</p>
<p>No Impact on Chinese Railways</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway, operated by the Japanese in the Northeast, has generated astonishing profits over the years. Even with the high gold prices and reduced transportation last year, the railway's income was still considerable. However, because the profits were not as high as in previous years, the Japanese claimed that the impact was due to the efforts of the Northeast authorities in railway construction and the price reduction of joint transportation on the Northeast railways. Recently, they have harbored the intention of undermining this and, as a result of discussions by the South Manchuria Railway Company authorities, have implemented a reduction in the freight rates for special products between Shenyang and Yingkou, changing to a silver standard, and extending this to Andong and Dalian. From mid-March to the end of September, the freight rates for special products shipped from Shenyang and various stations to Andong and Dalian will be temporarily reduced. A comparison of the new and old freight rates for the major stations along the South Manchuria Railway is as follows: (1) Shenyang: The current freight rate is 7.76 yuan per ton, and the newly revised rate is 5.76 yuan. (2) Kaiyuan: The current freight rate is 9.94 yuan per ton, and the newly revised rate is 7.94 yuan. (3) Sipingjie: The current freight rate is 11.99 yuan per ton, and the newly revised rate is 9.99 yuan. However, it remains doubtful whether the implementation of these specific price reductions will have a real effect. Even with Changchun as the starting point for goods exported to Dalian, Kobe, and Shanghai, the freight rates are still higher than those of the Chinese railways. Therefore, although the Japanese are trying to counter Chinese railways, the Chinese railways may not be significantly affected. The differences between Chinese and Japanese freight rates are as follows: (1) South Manchuria Railway: From Changchun to Dalian, the rate is 375.9 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Chinese Railway: From Changchun via Siping, Taonan, Yingkou to Dalian, the rate is 362.9 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Thus, the Chinese route from Changchun to Dalian is about 13 yuan cheaper (in Japanese currency) than the South Manchuria Railway route. (2) South Manchuria Railway: From Changchun via Dalian to Kobe, the rate is 451.4 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Chinese Railway: From Changchun via Yingkou to Kobe, the rate is 441.39 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Thus, the Chinese route from Changchun to Kobe is about 10.01 yuan cheaper (in Japanese currency) than the South Manchuria Railway route. (3) South Manchuria Railway: From Changchun via Dalian to Shanghai, the rate is 451.4 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Chinese Railway: From Changchun via Yingkou to Shanghai, the rate is 440.8 yuan (Japanese currency) per ton. Thus, the Chinese route from Changchun to Shanghai is about 10.6 yuan cheaper (in Japanese currency) than the South Manchuria Railway route. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Wu Tiecheng's Speech on the Northeast under Japanese and Russian Aggression (Continued) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>As for Japan's aggression against our Northeast, it has become an undeniable fact. They have historical, diplomatic, and factual bases. They take all the so-called rights of succession, unequal treaties, financial institutions, etc., with the South Manchuria Railway as the center, and steadily advance their policy of aggression. They even completely changed the local names and regarded the Northeast as the Japanese's Manchuria and Mongolia. Not only that, in addition to the special establishment of various political and cultural invasion agencies along the South Manchuria Railway, they even set up fortresses across borders in military terms, and even carried out cross-border activities in police terms. They also declared themselves to be maintaining law and order for China and exposing reactionary elements for China. Isn't this turning the guest into the host and despising China's sovereignty? Speaking of the economic aggression of the Japanese, it goes without saying. Most of everything we need in our daily lives in the Northeast is Japanese. Although China also has several banks in terms of financial institutions, the driving force that dominates finance is entirely in the hands of Japanese banks. The same is true for industry, commerce, export, and import, all of which are controlled by the Japanese. Even our lives are almost in the hands of the Japanese. This is a very dangerous thing. It seems that the prices in the Northeast are several times more expensive than those inside the customs, because the economic organization, such as industry and commerce, uses the Japanese gold standard. The Northeast, which is vast and rich in resources, has now been reduced to gold price confusion and food shortages, which can be said to be completely dominated by Japanese imperialism. Since the Japanese have this status in the Northeast, their so-called special interests naturally go beyond the scope of the private transactions between Japan and Russia at that time. Originally, the Japanese's so-called special interests were the inheritance of the so-called vested interests of Imperial Russia when Japan defeated Imperial Russia. But what is it now? Isn't it already more than ten thousand times the vested interests of Imperial Russia at that time? Looking at the above situation as a whole, since the Northeast is in such a siege of imperialist encirclement on all sides, in order to save China, we must first rescue the Northeast from the joint attack of Japan and Russia. In order to achieve freedom and equality, we must first enrich the Northeast, the gateway of China, and make it complete. Now, according to my humble opinion, we should have the following determination and attention:</p>
<p>Regarding the negative aspects: (1) Japan must abandon its so-called special interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. Before it has actually abandoned them, it must be prevented from developing and expanding the scope of its interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. (2) After the abolition, all agreements between Japan and any third country regarding Japan's position in Manchuria and Mongolia must be terminated at the same time, and Japan must be prevented from having any agreements of the same nature with third countries. (3) We must strengthen our defenses and prevent the Han Chinese traitors from privately granting the rights to all forests, mines, and land to the Japanese. (4) Before the recovery of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Soviet Russia must sincerely fulfill the Sino-Russian-Fengtian Agreement, and the principle of equality must be followed in the employment and administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (5) Before the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Soviet Russia must guarantee that it will not promote communism in China, endanger China's national system, and use money to buy Chinese bandits to transform into communists to disrupt China's security. Even after the resumption of diplomatic relations, if there are still communist bandits found to be rioting in China, Soviet Russia cannot shirk its responsibility to the Third International. (6) A thorough study should be conducted on the issue of trade, because Russian commerce is state-operated, while Chinese commerce is privately operated. The two sides should discuss the fairest and most appropriate method to ensure that Chinese private commerce in Russia is not destroyed by Soviet Russian state-operated commerce. (7) Soviet Russia should immediately cease all actions to incite and control Outer Mongolia and withdraw the Soviet Russian troops stationed in Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>The above are the negative measures, which are also the measures that should be taken to deal with imperialism. As for the positive measures, they are designed to build China, especially the Northeast, that is, to concentrate all our strength to develop the resources of the Northeast, that is, forests, minerals, and immigration to reclaim wasteland, to enrich the Northeast, and to ensure that there is not an inch of space and leakage on the ground in the Northeast, so that imperialists have no opportunity to invade. However, whether it is negatively dealing with imperialists or actively planning the construction of China, especially the Northeast, we must stand on the basis of unity, peace, stability, and national unity, and then the abolition of unequal treaties and the construction of China will have the hope and grasp of success. In other words, China is not unified, not peaceful, or falsely unified and falsely peaceful, and it is impossible to abolish unequal treaties and plan the construction of China. Since the National Diplomacy Association was established to save China, especially to save the Northeast, it should, in accordance with the Prime Minister's will, first awaken all the people of the Northeast to seek the most violent and dangerous Japanese and Russian invasion, which is the most powerful way to resist imperialism, because even if countries such as Britain, France, Italy, and the United States are willing to abandon unequal treaties, Japan still wants to maintain its special interests, and Soviet Russia still cannot stop its conspiracy against the Northeast, then the Northeast will not be free for a day, and China will not be independent for a day. Today's Northeast is like the throat of a person in China, and has a relationship of life and death. The future prosperity and decline of China's national fortune and the growth and decline of national power are directly affected by the solution of the Northeast issue. Today, I have contributed this humble opinion, hoping that the members of the National Diplomacy Association will awaken the people of the Northeast and strive forward. I am not talented, but I am also very willing to follow the comrades and struggle together.</p>

<p>Details of the Arrest of Zhou Amei, etc. The case of the arrest of bandit Zhou Amei, as reported yesterday, is now investigated and reported. According to a confidential report on the first of this month, traces of bandits were found in the Miaojiaqiao area on the border of Qingpu. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent Inspector Yang to lead investigators to Miaojiaqiao, where they arrested two bandits, Cai Jinquan and Yu Zhongru, and seized an eight-inch revolver. They were interrogated and confessed that the major bandit Zhou Amei was hiding in the Chaichangqiao area in Punan, and that they dared not live at home due to the tense situation. They then went to Tinglin and joined forces with Pan Yongqiang, the head of the First Branch Bureau, to secretly set off at 2:00 a.m. on the third day. They searched the Chaichangqiao area and found Zhou Amei in a pile of messy firewood in a bullock cart shed. At first, he denied it, but then Cai and Yu, who had already been arrested, identified him, and he admitted that he had robbed the Qinglianggang area in Jiashan County, as well as the families of Fanbang, Xixiang Fanbang, Songjing Punan New Street Zhang Renbo and others in Qingpu County. It is said that in the robbery case of a certain Fanbang family, the owner was shot and injured, which is truly a famous and fierce bandit.</p>

<p>Scheduled Election of People's Assembly Representatives The Wu County Government is handling the election of National Assembly representatives, and the work is exceptionally busy. The voting is now scheduled for April 7, and the counting of votes is on the 8th. The location is the main hall of the county government, and Fan Junbo and others have been hired as supervisors. Currently, the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations will set up temporary offices near the county government.</p>
<p>Organizing the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce The Chambers of Commerce of various counties in Jiangsu, this time to discuss the business tax issue, held a joint meeting in the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce a few days ago, and incidentally discussed the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from more than 30 counties unanimously approved. At that time, the representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of nine counties, including Wu County, Wujiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, and Nantong, were appointed as organizers, and they submitted a report to the Provincial Party Department requesting permission to organize, and actively proceeded with the preparations.</p>

<p>The Issue of Affixing Stamps to Business Licenses After the government reduced the likin, various provinces are implementing business tax, which is about to be levied. The stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus of Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces have asked the Ministry of Finance how to handle the affixing of stamps to business licenses applied for by various businesses. The Ministry has decided that those with capital of more than 500 yuan should affix a stamp worth 5 jiao per license, and those with capital of less than 500 yuan should affix a stamp worth 1 jiao 5 fen per license. The provincial bureaus have issued orders to the various branch bureaus to comply with this. The Wuxi Stamp Tax Branch Bureau has also received the provincial order and forwarded it to the County Chamber of Commerce for assistance. The Chamber of Commerce has replied, stating that the Chambers of Commerce of various counties recently held a meeting in Zhenjiang to discuss the business tax issue, and this case was thoroughly discussed. It was unanimously believed that the principle of stamp tax is to prove rights, while the business license is a public certificate given to merchants who pay business tax, which is only sufficient to prove obligations, not rights, and is the same as the receipt issued to people who pay land tax. There is no need to affix stamps. Since the business tax is being levied for the first time, merchants still have objections to the tax rate, and many are hesitant to register for licenses. If they are forced to pay stamp tax again, it may not be beneficial to the stamp tax, and it will be an obstacle to the business tax. It was decided to jointly submit a report to the Ministry by the Chambers of Commerce of all provinces to request cancellation. Yesterday, the Stamp Tax Bureau was informed of the situation for its reference.</p>
<p>Electricity Price Increase The Qishuyan Power Plant is affected by the rising prices of gold and the devaluation of silver, as well as the soaring prices of various electrical materials. Fuel coal, which is the raw material for power generation, accounts for more than 50% of the total expenditure. This year's market price is more than one or two higher than in previous years, and the electricity price is still collected at a 10% discount from the set price, resulting in significant losses. It has been decided to collect the full price of 1 jiao 8 fen from May 1 to compensate for the losses. The county government and the Chamber of Commerce have been notified separately for their information.</p>
<p>Tongxinchang Paper Shop Sealed Up The Tongxinchang Paper Shop, located on Daqiao Street outside the North Gate, has been in operation for more than 60 years. The major shareholder is Peng Jingchu from Suzhou, and the manager is Peng Zhongpei. At the end of last year, due to poor turnover, it went bankrupt, owing a total of more than 100,000 yuan. The Shaoxing foil merchants and the local money shops in Wuxi have successively filed lawsuits with the County Court, and the money shop representative Cai Yourong and others twisted Peng Zhongpei to the Fifth Branch Bureau of Public Security, and transferred him to the County Public Security Bureau for transfer to the County Court for interrogation. Because there was no cash guarantee of 60,000 yuan, he was immediately detained for interrogation. Yesterday, the County Court sent Secretary Liu, together with various creditors, to Daqiao Street and Luhua Lane to seal up the shop and warehouse successively, pending liquidation and repayment.</p>

<p>The Finance Department is Cleaning Up Abandoned Farmland The Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department has previously drafted measures for cleaning up abandoned farmland without grain production throughout the province and levying additional grain tax, which was approved by the 380th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee and issued to all counties for compliance. Now, the Finance Department, considering the urgent deadline, has specifically scheduled a meeting on the 10th of this month to gather representatives from ten counties with the most abandoned farmland, including Zhenjiang, Jintan, Liyang, Nantong, Haimen, Changshu, Lishui, Jurong, Kunshan, and Wu County, to discuss the measures together to facilitate the process. In addition to sending notices to the various counties to report to the province at that time, it has also been notified that the abandoned farmland in each county should be based on the old amount in the Complete Book of Taxes and Duties or the County Chronicle, according to the original plan. Except for the County Chronicle, which cannot be verified within the department, many of the Complete Book of Taxes and Duties are also incomplete. It has been found that the numbers listed in the remaining incomplete Complete Book of Taxes and Duties, the Interior Administration Report of the Republic of China in the second year, and the recent autumn survey registration are mutually confirmed, but there are discrepancies. Therefore, a copy of the list has been issued to the various counties for detailed investigation, and a separate list should be prepared and brought to the province to determine the standard.</p>
<p>The Clearing Bureau Executes Ma Ling, a Monk from Shandong named Zeng Chuanze, who was once a monk in the Ma Ling area, hence the name Ma Ling Monk. During the warlord era, he served as a battalion commander under Qi Xieyuan. Later, he secretly occupied Xinfeng Hexi, secretly gathering followers, specializing in robbery, committing numerous crimes, and ultimately failing to be captured after fleeing east and west. A month ago, the criminal was bathing in a Xin Feng bathhouse, and after bathing, he was gambling in Qiaoxi, which led to his capture by the Fourth Clearing Bureau and his transfer to the County Clearing Bureau. After interrogation and identification, the evidence was confirmed, and a report was submitted to the Provincial Clearing Bureau and forwarded to the Provincial Government for approval to impose the death penalty. Therefore, Director Zhang of the County Clearing Bureau specifically brought the bandit out of prison yesterday (the 4th) at 9:00 a.m., verified his identity, tied him to the execution ground outside the North Gate, and executed him by shooting.</p>

<p>A Careless Fire in a Woodyard Near the city wall outside the north gate there is a woodyard owned by Chen Renxian, At 4 p.m. One day the fire ignited in a stack of firewood.  The smoke was billowing and the fire was strong.  Firefighters tried to save it but were hindered because it was close to the city wall and a river.  Fortunately the sixth company of the hand gun regiment stationed near the north gate came after they heard the alarm and rescued it with all the water dragons. The fire was finally put out, before it could affect other homes.  The result was two stacks of grass and two thatched cottages and other sundries were burned.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Various Trade Tax Rules Associations Telegraph Request for Revision of Business Tax Rates <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Rate Shall Not Exceed Two Per Thousand</p>
<p>The Whole Sale Part Shall Be Taxed at One Quarter</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the city's various trade associations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the 3rd regarding the business tax, saying, "To the Nanjing National Government Ministry of Finance, We have learned that the outline of the business tax and supplementary measures stipulates that for those who use the amount of business as the tax standard, the maximum shall not exceed two per thousand, and those who use the amount of capital as the tax standard, the maximum shall not exceed twenty per thousand. The meaning is very clear. However, after reading the business tax rates of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces revised by the Ministry, except for grain, oil, salt, firewood, charcoal, and planning industries, all exceed the maximum amount of two per thousand. The intention is to speculate that the outline has provisions on luxury businesses and those that contain the nature of being banned, so this exceeds the maximum tax rate. However, after examining the commodities that pay five or ten per thousand tax, such as the paint industry, water cement industry, industry, rubber industry, etc., most of them are necessary for daily use or belong to the scope that should be promoted. The tax rate should be reduced to conform to the central government's original intention of cutting likin. Moreover, at the beginning of this tax system reform, it is especially appropriate to avoid the heavy and take the light to make it easy to promote and benefit. However, it is heard that the tax rates proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau are also based on the first revision by the Ministry, which violates the provisions of the outline, increases the burden on merchants and citizens, and Shanghai has special circumstances, which cannot be compared with other provinces. The implementation of the business tax is only an accidental income. It is not the same as other provinces that have suffered losses from the cut likin. The implementation of the business tax is only an accidental income. It is not the same as other provinces that have suffered losses from the cut likin. The implementation of the business tax is only an accidental income. It is not the same as other provinces that have suffered losses from the cut likin. The implementation of the business tax is only an accidental income. It is not the same as other provinces that have suffered losses from the cut likin. Low taxes do not hinder the progress of municipal administration, and high taxes are enough to困營the survival of the industry. The right to gain and loss should be based on the economy. Moreover, Shanghai's business market is prosperous in other provinces. The competition in the same industry is also very fierce. Business operators mostly aim at small profits and cheap sales. The tax burden should be relatively light. The business tax contains the nature of income tax. According to the situation, it cannot be taxed too high. Moreover, the region has the separation of concessions, and the shops have purely foreign capital. In order to achieve a universal and average burden, the tax rate must be reduced so that merchants and citizens are happy to donate and contribute to the government's tax revenue. The former Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun said that Mayor Zhang meant that if Shanghai holds a business tax in the future, the tax rate will not be higher than the regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, or even slightly lower than it to reduce the burden on citizens. It is enough to see the crux of the problem. Although the city's merchants are in a state of business depression, if the tax rate is indeed in line with the provisions of the outline approved by the Executive Yuan, they should be able to understand the good intentions of the authorities to care for the people's livelihood and strive to pay taxes. If the provisions of the outline are used as a proviso and become an unlimited heavy tax, it cannot be an excessive burden, hinder the survival of one's own business, and绝the future tax revenue of the country. It is reasonable to submit a telegram to appeal, urging the Department to revise the business tax rates of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces again, and to correct the tax rate when the city's business tax rate is requested for approval. The tax rate shall not exceed two per thousand, and the wholesale part shall still maintain the original draft of the Shanghai Municipality and be taxed at one quarter to reduce the burden and benefit the commercial industry. At the end of the telegram, I cannot wait to receive orders, The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Industry Association叩Jiang."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Exemption from Business Tax Items <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Joint Association</p>
<p>Telegram Request for Supplementary Interpretation</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Silk Fabric Trade Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting supplementary interpretation of various issues regarding the exemption from business tax. The original telegram stated: "Respectfully to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, regarding the business tax on silk fabrics, your Ministry, in accordance with the Central Government's intention, has uniformly reduced the proposed tax rate for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces to two per thousand, demonstrating your utmost concern for protecting domestic products and caring for agriculture and commerce, which is deeply admired. However, regarding the exemption portion, supplementary interpretation from your Ministry is needed to avoid misunderstandings during collection in various provinces and cities. We respectfully submit the following details: (1) The exemption of business tax for wholesale businesses directly established by manufacturers has already been approved in your Ministry's document Fu Zi No. 5675, communicated by telegram to the Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association. However, according to item one of the five-point notification on key points of business tax interpretation issued by your Ministry, it is stipulated that provinces shall not levy business tax on factories or companies that have already paid consolidated tax or special consumption tax, but commercial firms and shops engaged in promotion and sales shall still be subject to business tax. The so-called commercial firms and shops engaged in promotion and sales specifically refer to those engaged in retail sales. The so-called wholesale businesses directly established by factories or companies, regardless of whether they use the name of a commercial firm or shop due to commercial practices, should all follow the telegram approval and be exempt from business tax. This is the first item requiring supplementary interpretation. (2) Wholesale businesses directly established by manufacturers have now been approved for exemption from business tax. Therefore, the scope of 'manufacturer' should be broadly defined. Large-scale silk factories and handicraft workshops are both manufacturers in nature. In terms of capability, workshops are even weaker than factories. If wholesale outlets directly established by silk factories can be exempt from business tax, then wholesale distribution centers jointly entrusted to agents by workshops, commonly known as silk stores, should also be exempt. This is the second item requiring supplementary interpretation. (3) The exemption of business tax for brokers who only buy and do not sell has also been approved in your Ministry's document Fu Zi No. 5754, communicated by telegram to the Shanghai Various Industries Tax Regulations Research Committee, stating that brokers who only buy and do not sell have no business income and are naturally not subject to collection, and are not listed in the business tax regulations submitted by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, so there is no cause for dispute. However, we fear that without a clear regulation, collecting officials may have misunderstandings. This is the third item requiring supplementary interpretation. Regarding the above three items, we respectfully request your Ministry's approval and issuance of a general order to all provinces and cities to comply with, so as to avoid disputes through common understanding. We anxiously await your instructions. Sincerely, the Preparatory Office of the Joint Association of Silk Fabric Trade Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, bows."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Second Day of the Fisheries Improvement Promotion Conference <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) was the second day of the Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City Fisheries Improvement Promotion Conference, still held at the Minli Middle School in Xiaonanmen. Due to recreational performances, the number of attendees was even greater than on the first day. The situation at the venue is recorded below:</p>
<p>Venue Situation: The venue opened at 9:00 AM for people to view various exhibits. Recreational performances began at 1:00 PM, with programs including a costumed speech by a youth propaganda team, fishermen's songs and dances, and fisheries films, including (1) "Exploring the Sea," (2) "Ocean Wonders," (3) "Warm-Water Fish Situation," and (4) "Whaling Situation," in four reels. Marine products, animals, plants, and various fishing boats and gear were rare items, so the viewers were extremely crowded. At 2:30 PM, the entrance was announced to be closed. Even at 4:00 PM, people continued to arrive in an endless stream, vying to rush in. Despite the polite persuasion of the conference staff, the noise was deafening, and the situation was turbulent. Some even climbed over the walls to enter. Fearing an accident, the conference stopped the recreational performances, and the situation calmed down. The performances continued again around 7:00 PM in the evening. In total, no less than 9,000 people attended yesterday morning. Furthermore, to attract the interest of the guests, the conference stipulated a prize-giving method: each ticket entitled one person to draw a lot once, with a modest gift of cuttlefish, small yellow croaker, prawns, etc., totaling 20,000 tickets. Among them, the numbers with prizes were 3,000. Yesterday, more than 1,000 numbers were drawn, it is said.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Exhibition: The exhibition area was divided into ten rooms. Rooms 1, 2, and 3 were for private products; Room 4 was for ocean meteorology and navigation items; Room 5 was for fishing gear and tackle; Room 6 was for old-style fisheries in coastal Jiangsu Province; Room 7 was for new-style fishing boats and nets from foreign countries; Room 8 was for water product division inscriptions; Room 9 was for new-style fisheries and fishing area models; and Room 10 was for water product manufactures, such as salt-cured, dried, and shellfish products, as well as water product economic charts. The visitors were led by water product expert Mr. Wang Defa, who toured each room and provided detailed explanations. Among the items on display, the models of Chinese coastal fishing grounds, the theodolite, the astronomical clock, and the national emblem made of shellfish were particularly rare. Overall, the arrangement of each room was rich in artistic flair.</p>
<p>Staff Meeting: Due to the large number of visitors, the conference was unable to provide adequate reception, and to expand publicity, it was decided that staff should be temporarily added. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held at 12:00 PM. The attending committee members were Cai Hengru, Hou Chaohai, Zhou Jianyin, Wang Wentai, Zhou Hanmei, etc. The following five proposals were agreed upon:</p>
<p>(1) Request the Public Security Bureau to send eight more police officers to maintain order at the recreational performance and prize-giving lottery. (2) Assign staff to the recreational performance venue and various exhibition rooms. (3) Hire additional water product experts to give lectures. (4) Print more publications to expand publicity. (5) Assign a special representative to receive news reporters.</p>
<p>Today's Program: In addition to continuing the exhibition and recreational performances, the conference will also invite representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as well as water product expert Mr. Li Dongpu, to give a lecture entitled "Strategies for Improving China's Fisheries," it is said.</p>

<p>Yan Shenyu, the election supervisor of the Shanghai County National Assembly representatives, has scheduled the voting election for the Minhang Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Aquatic and Timber Industry Association for 10:00 AM on the 6th of this month (today). It is known that Supervisor Yan considers this election to be of great importance and should be handled carefully. The voting locations for the two groups are instructed to be arranged by Director Wu of the First District. On one hand, a summary of the election law will be announced.

<h3 id="e92">Interpretation of the Cloth Industry Regarding the Issuance of Transport Permits <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Consolidated Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, previously due to repeated requests from the cloth industry to issue transport permits for inspection and release, in order to be especially considerate of commercial transport difficulties, approved that all directly woven products with the original cotton yarn fixed tax certificate can also apply for transport permits for customs inspection and release. The industry has been able to conveniently declare exports since April 1. Unexpectedly, merchants in various inland cloth producing regions are dissatisfied. The reason is that since handmade native cloth is exempt from tax, this procedure could have been omitted, resulting in more than thirty documents from the Jiangyin, Wujin, and Wuxi county chambers of commerce, as well as the native cloth industry associations of various provinces, requesting the Ministry of Finance Consolidated Tax Administration to stop issuing transport permits. It is now heard that the local cloth industry believes that after this native cloth is exempt from tax, holding a transport document with a regional certification of origin will prevent difficulties along the way. Now, the Consolidated Tax Administration is instructing local industry associations to apply for the transport permits from the Consolidated Tax Administration Bureau, which is a more complete procedure. The opposition from the native cloth industries in various places is a misunderstanding. The course of events is specifically sent to various chambers of commerce to inform all colleagues in the native cloth industry, to avoid disputes, it is said.</p>

<p>The Consolidated Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Chinese Yarn Factory Association, stating: "Respectfully to the recipient, it is hereby ordered by the Ministry of Finance that, prior to the establishment of the consolidated tax on cotton yarn (February 1), if merchants have prepaid customs duties and the customs dispatch notes they hold have not been used up by April 15 of this year, and if the customs duties that should have been stopped are paid with said dispatch notes after the consolidated tax was collected, but before the customs implemented the method of exempting customs duties for items on which the consolidated tax has already been collected, the Consolidated Tax Administration will refund the amount. However, if merchants have obtained dispatch notes from customs after the consolidated tax was established on February 1, and the dispatch notes are still in the merchants' hands, or have already been used to pay customs duties that should have been stopped, the customs will refund the amount uniformly. It should be obeyed. However, the amount of consolidated tax that each yarn factory should pay monthly is usually cleared at the end of the month. If there are any of the above circumstances, please submit a special case to the Consolidated Tax Administration for the drawback dispatch notes, and after verification, a reply will be given and the amount will be issued in accordance with the regulations. It is not necessary to deduct the amount yourself when settling the tax payment, in order to clarify the amount and avoid confusion. In addition to sending a separate document, a corresponding document is hereby sent for your review and to inform all manufacturers."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sausage Industry Association sent a telegram yesterday to the National Government Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: "Respectfully to the National Government Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry and Commerce, pig, cattle, and sheep intestines in our country are one of our native products. After being manufactured into finished products by hand, they are transported to countries such as Germany, France, and the United States for sales, relying on this trade to make a living. There are tens of thousands of people across the country. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic, the number of these trades has decreased year by year, and industry and commerce have also been in a state of difficulty. The export trade of so-called cattle and sheep intestines has been in a slump, and the amount of trade is actually close to nothing. However, the pig intestine business is also in a precarious state. The reason is that the export tariff is too high, which is a major blow. Moreover, in the past two years, the customs tax assessment has often exceeded the actual selling price, resulting in another layer of hidden losses. If this continues without seeking relief, it will inevitably be completely eliminated. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. After repeated deliberation, we can only respectfully request that when your ministry formulates export tariffs, the export tax on pig intestines be specially reduced and listed as an example of three per cent of the value. We have always admired your ministry's concern for people's livelihood and consideration for industry and commerce, so we are taking the liberty of sending a telegram to appeal. We implore you to examine and approve our request. We anxiously await your instructions. Sincerely, the Shanghai Sausage Industry Association."</p>

<p>The New Voice Society states that the Shanghai Customs Brokers' Union, in response to the textile industry's deduction of transportation fees, held a congress of representatives from various industries. More than one hundred members attended. Ren Xiong was publicly elected as chairman. After the meeting began, the chairman first reported that the textile industry had broken the union's decades-old precedent by deducting transportation fees, which had been disclosed in the newspapers. Since April 1, the union has been refusing to pay. How should the representatives deal with this situation? Please express your opinions as much as possible. Then, one person was selected from each group to express their opinions. As a result, everyone took unanimous action, asking the union to order a strike immediately and demanding that the union recover the losses of the past two months from the other party and increase transportation fees. The Social Affairs Bureau instructor and the union directors tried their best to persuade them, promising to submit the matter to the party and government organs for handling immediately and not to riot, and to wait quietly for a resolution. All workers put forward two conditions: (1) A resolution should be reached within the shortest possible time. (2) Before a resolution is reached, the subsidies paid at each wharf should be issued by the union. Otherwise, they would take independent action.

<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Jiangsu Department of Finance, stating: "It has been found that the land tax in this province has always been based on silver and rice.

All counties should uniformly convert the silver and rice due into foreign codes before the 20th year of the Republic. It is hereby urgently ordered that the county magistrate comply with the order and proceed. This is a specially designated item for this year and should not be delayed in the slightest."

<h3 id="e104">Youth Association Municipal Lecture <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>An Overview of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipality</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association held a municipal lecture the day before yesterday titled "An Overview of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipality." The speaker was Mr. He Dekui, secretary of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>(1) The origin of the International Settlement dates back to 1842, when China and Britain signed the Treaty of Nanjing, stipulating that Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai be opened as treaty ports for trade. The following year, Shanghai was designated as a place for foreign merchants to trade, allowing British residents to live north of the Yangjingbang Creek. However, Chinese government officials were not allowed to sell land outright to the British, only to grant them perpetual lease rights. This is where the name "settlement" comes from. Later, other countries also signed trade treaties with the Qing government. Consequently, there were also people from other countries living in the British settlement, including American missionaries and merchants. Some even acquired property and resided in Hongkou, thus forming the so-called American Settlement. The areas of the British and American settlements gradually expanded as the population grew. In 1863, the British and American settlements merged to form the International Settlement. This is a general overview of the origin of the International Settlement.</p>
<p>(2) The current situation of mixed Chinese and foreign residence in the International Settlement: Before 1899, the area of the International Settlement was 10,006 mu. The current area of the International Settlement was expanded in 1899 with the approval of the Shanghai Daotai, increasing it by more than three times the original area, totaling 33,503 mu. According to the population statistics of last October, residents of the International Settlement came from 47 countries. Among them, foreign men, women, and children totaled more than 36,400, with Japanese being the largest group at more than 18,400. The British were the second largest with more than 6,200, followed by Russians with more than 3,400. Indians, Americans, and Portuguese followed, each with more than 1,000. The Chinese residing in the International Settlement, including men, women, and children, totaled more than 971,000, with Jiangsu natives accounting for the largest number at 500,000, followed by Zhejiang natives with 300,000, Guangdong natives with more than 44,000, and Anhui natives with more than 20,000, ranking fourth. This is a general overview of the area and population of the International Settlement.</p>
<p>(3) The autonomous system of the International Settlement: The municipality of the International Settlement is a local autonomous system, with the Land Regulations as its basic law and foundation for autonomy. According to the provisions of these Land Regulations, municipal power belongs to the ratepayers. Any foreigner within the settlement who owns property used for business purposes with a value of 500 taels, and who pays annual property or land or land and building taxes of more than 10 taels in addition to the license fee, or who rents a house with an annual rent of more than 500 taels and pays taxes, is qualified as a ratepayer, has the right to elect members of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), and may attend the ratepayers' meeting. As for foreigners inside or outside the settlement who pay land taxes of more than 50 taels annually in addition to the license fee, or who rent a house with an annual rent of more than 1,200 taels and pay taxes, they are not only able to attend the ratepayers' meeting and have the right to vote, but also have the qualifications to be elected as members of the SMC. According to the Land Regulations, the foreign members of the SMC must be at least five and no more than nine. Each year, the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai convene an annual meeting of foreign ratepayers in February or March to elect members and to deliberate on all important matters of the SMC, review the SMC's financial statements for the previous year, and deliberate on the budget for the current year. There is no quorum for this annual meeting, and it can be held regardless of the number of attendees. However, all motions are still decided by a majority of those present. In case of special issues concerning the settlement, one or more consuls may convene, or 25 ratepayers may jointly request, a special meeting of foreign ratepayers. This special meeting requires the attendance of one-third of the foreign ratepayers to be convened, and motions are still decided by a majority of those present. The SMC members must prepare a report on the municipal situation in the past year, and must submit the financial statements for the previous year and the budget for the current year to the ratepayers' annual meeting. There are about 2,700 foreign ratepayers inside and outside the settlement, but the number of attendees at the annual meeting is not large. The proposals put forward by the SMC are usually passed. This is a general overview of the autonomous system of the International Settlement.</p>
<p>(4) The relationship between Chinese ratepayers and the municipal affairs of the settlement: Since 1926, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has been able to nominate three Chinese members to join the SMC and participate in the municipal affairs of the settlement. Although this is not stipulated in the Land Regulations, it was negotiated and agreed upon by the Consular Body and the Chinese authorities. The first time three Chinese members joined the SMC was in 1928. Until 1930, the number of Western members remained at nine, while the number of Chinese members increased to five. This was also decided after consultation between the Consular Body and the Chinese authorities. The qualifications of Chinese ratepayers and their qualifications to be elected as Chinese members are exactly the same as those of foreign ratepayers and foreign members mentioned above. However, foreign members do not have to reside in Shanghai for more than five years, while according to the regulations of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, all Chinese members must reside in the settlement for more than five years. This is the only difference.</p>
<p>(5) The organization of the SMC and its committees: At present, the SMC has a total of fourteen members. In addition to the five Chinese members, there are usually five British members, two American members, and two Japanese members. The important administration of the SMC is decided by the SMC, and the SMC also has the power to appoint or dismiss personnel working in the bureau. SMC meetings are held once every two or three weeks. Usually, if there are important official documents, they are sent to each member for their comments. The SMC has one chairman and one vice-chairman, who are elected from among the members. All members are honorary positions and are not paid. However, because there are many matters to be decided by the SMC, and they are very complex in nature, various committees are set up in addition to the SMC, such as the Police Committee, Finance Committee, Works Committee, Health Committee, Education Committee, Staff Committee, Traffic Committee, Public Utilities Committee, Music Committee, Library Committee, and Public Sports Ground Committee. The number of people on these committees ranges from two or three to seven or eight. For more important committees, there must be one or two SMC members on the committee. If a problem occurs in the SMC, it is usually first discussed by the relevant committee, and a resolution is made, which is then reviewed by the SMC. It is only valid after approval by the SMC. These committees discuss their respective affairs separately and must obtain the approval of the SMC, so the procedures are more complete. Most of these committees are honorary positions, except for one or two that are paid. When the Chinese Ratepayers' Association nominated three Chinese members to join the SMC in 1928, they also nominated six Chinese committee members to join the various committees of the SMC. In recent years, the SMC has often had special problems, and has established several new committees and invited more Chinese committee members to join. Therefore, the total number of Chinese committee members in the various committees of the SMC is now more than ten. Because the SMC and various committees are all honorary positions, and because each member and committee member is engaged in business, they can only take care of more important issues and can only decide on policies, so the SMC often employs paid civil servants to carry out affairs according to the policies they have set.</p>
<p>(6) The permanent organs of the SMC: The various executive powers of the SMC are all in the hands of the permanently employed and paid civil servants. The highest position among the paid personnel was originally called Director General, but from April 1st of this year, the name was changed to Secretary General, translated as "督辦" (supervisor). Below him are 总办 (General Manager), Secretary, as well as the Chief of Police, Chief of Finance, Chief of Works, Chief of Health, Chief of Education, Chief of Taxes, Municipal Advocate, Fire Chief, and Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, who are in charge of various administrative matters. The above-mentioned departments have many employees and require a lot of expenses. The SMC's budget for 1930 was 16 million taels for the whole year, of which the Police Department accounted for more than 5.4 million taels, the Works Department accounted for more than 3.7 million taels, the Health Department accounted for more than 800,000 taels, the General Affairs Department accounted for 590,000 taels, and the Finance Department also accounted for more than 270,000 taels. These are all important organs of the SMC. The General Affairs Department is so named because all external announcements of the SMC must be announced through the General Affairs Department.</p>
<p>(7) The minimum expectations for the SMC: According to a survey in 1930, the residents of the International Settlement, all foreigners combined, account for only slightly more than 3% of the total number of residents, and the rest are Chinese. The property and taxes paid by the Chinese in the settlement also account for more than half. Therefore, the impact of the administration and all measures of the settlement on the Chinese is naturally greater than that on foreigners. The administration of our settlement has always been biased towards foreigners. All senior administrative personnel are foreigners. The positions of Chinese are always lower than those of foreign personnel, and they have no real power in their hands. Because of differences in customs, habits, language, etc., the Chinese and foreigners are different, so all the measures of the senior administrative personnel of the SMC are often not suitable for the Chinese, causing various misunderstandings, or even leading to unfortunate incidents. At present, there are already Chinese members on the SMC and Chinese committee members on the various committees, which is a great improvement compared to the past. However, it is still a pity that there are not many Chinese employed in senior paid positions, so that they can do their best to assist in administrative affairs. Since the Chinese in the settlement account for more than 96% of the total population, more Chinese should be employed as senior paid personnel to increase the efficiency of administration, because seeking the welfare of the majority of Chinese residents in the settlement is seeking improvement in the municipal administration of the International Settlement. If senior administrative personnel can employ more Chinese, all measures in the International Settlement will be able to eliminate various barriers and work together in the spirit of Chinese-foreign cooperation to seek progress in the municipal administration of the settlement. There is nothing more important for the SMC to do at present. Recently, our countrymen have had persistent demands regarding the concessions of various countries in China. During this transitional period, the settlement authorities should have a thorough understanding and a bright attitude. However, because this issue is slightly different from the scope of discussion of this topic, and because of the limited time, I cannot discuss it in detail. Therefore, I will only state the minimum expectations as above.</p>

<p>The Customs Brokers' Association Opposes</p>
<p>The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company initiated a meeting with China Merchants Steam Navigation, Sanpei, Ningshao, and other companies to discuss cooperation and increase freight rates to avoid competition among the industry. The Hankou Customs Brokers' Association opposed this and submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to stop it. After receiving the request, the Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Shipping Association to investigate and respond. The Shipping Association then responded, stating that the six companies, including China Merchants Steam Navigation, had agreed on water freight rates according to the old practice to avoid competition and follow business customs. It was unavoidable and did not involve selling out Chinese merchants. The Ministry of Communications then approved the Hankou Customs Brokers' Association to be informed. According to Shi Zhikun, chairman of the Shanghai Customs Brokers' Association, the increase in water freight rates agreed upon by Taikoo, China Merchants Steam Navigation, Sanpei, and other companies is based on the example of last year. However, when the Yangtze River water freight rates of the various companies increased by 20% last year, it was stated that it would be based on the water level. This time, the agreed increase will be the same regardless of the water level. The details are currently being discussed, and it will be implemented as soon as it is agreed upon.</p>

<p>Will have their Tenure Extended after Performance Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government considered that the terms of office of Wu Jingqing, the chief of the first district, and others were about to expire. However, because various important political affairs urgently needed to be carried out, it was not advisable to change hands hastily. Therefore, County Chief Yan ordered them to continue their terms of office separately, and also reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for record. Subsequently, the Department of Civil Affairs approved the order. The order is recorded as follows: Having received the report that the terms of office of Wu Jingqing, the chief of the first district, Yang Fulin, the chief of the third district, and Bi Huan, the chief of the fourth district of the county, have expired, and that their performance records have been confirmed to be successful, they should all be reappointed to ensure responsibility. The chiefs of the other districts should still have their performance reviewed at the end of their terms, and a report should be submitted. After County Chief Yan received the order, he immediately notified the district chiefs to comply and ordered them to work harder and complete the important political affairs such as the citizen's oath registration and township elections as soon as possible, so as to complete the county organization law and implement local autonomy as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Forcibly Occupy Vehicles and Force Departure from Shanghai</p>
<p>Assault Ticket Seller Ni Wuyi</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company, because of the beautiful spring weather and the opening of Longhua peach blossoms, added seven Route 2 buses on the first day of this month, specially to Longhua, for the convenience of visitors. Unexpectedly, at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Gao, the squad leader of the First Team stationed in Longhua of the Caohejing Security Team, led more than 20 policemen to forcibly occupy the vehicles without buying tickets, causing an argument and assaulting Ni Wuyi, the ticket seller of Bus No. 27, resulting in the complete shutdown of public buses, traffic interruption, and major chaos. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Cause of the Trouble: The Route 2 buses specially put on by the Shanghai South Public Bus Company arrived at the last stop of Longhua Temple at 4:10 p.m. yesterday and were picking up tourists to return to Shanghai. Suddenly, Gao, the squad leader of the First Team stationed in Longhua of the Caohejing Security Team, led more than 20 policemen to board the bus. Because the weather was mild and it was Sunday, there were many tourists in Longhua who wanted to take the bus back to Shanghai. The policemen occupied the seats and refused to let the tourists board, saying that the bus was a chartered bus and no passengers were allowed. Seeing that they were armed policemen, the tourists did not argue with them to avoid trouble, and could only wait for the next bus to arrive. After the bus departed, the ticket seller Ni Wuyi asked them to buy half-price tickets because they were military and police personnel. Unexpectedly, they ignored him. The ticket seller, seeing that there were many of them, could not argue and allowed them to ride. When the bus traveled about a mile to Maogong Bridge Station, the policemen suddenly got off the bus all at once, leaving no one in the bus. The driver saw that there were many tourists at Longhua Temple Station and wanted to drive the empty bus back to Longhua to pick up more tourists. When the bus was turning around, the policemen ordered him to drive the empty bus back to Shanghai and not to drive to Longhua again. They dragged Ni Wuyi, the ticket seller of Bus No. 27, off the bus, beat him, and then dispersed. The ticket seller suffered serious injuries to his waist and legs. Traffic was interrupted. After this incident occurred, the driver immediately notified the company by telephone, detailing the assault. Yang Pingcai, the director of the business department, and Xia Shuxiang, the director of the vehicle department of the company, were furious when they heard about this. They immediately went to the scene of the incident in Longhua and sent the injured person and the bus to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, they ordered all 12 buses that were driving to Longhua to stop. Because there were so many tourists in Longhua yesterday who were waiting for the bus to return to Shanghai, the temporary traffic interruption caused major chaos, and the onlookers were packed like sardines.</p>
<p>Authorities Mediate: Because yesterday was Sunday, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau was afraid that the crowd in Longhua would cause trouble, so they ordered Gao, the chief of the Sixth District, Third Precinct, to lead the police to maintain order nearby. Zhang, the director of the Second Section of the Traffic Department of the Public Security Bureau, and An, the director of the Fourth Section of the Vehicle Department of the Public Utilities Bureau, were also playing in Longhua yesterday and had not returned. When Zhang and An heard about this, they consulted with Yang and Xia of the bus company, and asked them to restore bus traffic first and be responsible for solving everything. Yang and Xia, with the permission of the authorities and to avoid disturbing the public's transportation, resumed normal operation at about 5:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Autopsy Results Show Corpse Relocation</p>
<p>Some Say the Corpse is 300 Years Old</p>
<p>Ancient Coffin Dug Up in Xiaoximen</p>
<p>Selling the Coffin and Cutting the Corpse, Discarding it in an Open Space</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Court previously received a report from Gu Tiuyun, the Baotou of the 25th Bao, 12th Tu, stating that there were two small wooden coffins on the open space of the Jiangxi Guild Hall on South Railway Station Branch Road, containing the head and body of an old man, with two wooden boxes and white bones on top. The corpses in the coffins were not completely decayed, but were cut into two sections. Fearing that it was a murder, he requested an autopsy. The District Court sent Prosecutor Wang and Examiner Xuan to the scene. The autopsy revealed that it was a corpse relocation. However, the purpose of the relocation was probably to steal the burial objects. However, this kind of behavior violated the law. Therefore, Prosecutor Wang sent the police to cooperate with the Baotou to investigate who the corpse belonged to, who excavated it, and whether the burial objects were stolen, so as to arrest the murderer. However, according to the people nearby, an ancient coffin and other white bones were found when renovating houses in Xiaoximen. The ancient coffin was completely un-decayed, with the vermilion lacquer still bright. There must have been valuable items inside. It was opened, and there was an old man's corpse inside, with gray hair and beard. The clothes and skin had not changed. The clothing was still in the style of more than 300 years ago. It is said that the coffin was made of lead wood, so it did not change over time. Later, someone took the coffin away and sold it, and the corpse rotted. Then, they cut the corpse into sections and put it into small coffins and discarded it in an open space, so there are no family members, etc. However, because no one came forward to testify, it was not convenient to report and investigate.</p>

Dong widely distributed obituaries, referring to her as the first wife. Therefore, Jiang Youzhi, believing that referring to Ms. Lu as the first wife was equivalent to recognizing her as a concubine (so she hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the District Court, requesting confirmation of her status. The court was scheduled to open on the morning of the 4th of this month. Because Dong did not arrive, the trial was postponed again.</p>

<p>Vanity had a Secret Compartment</p>
<p>Busted by Female Detective</p>
<p>Zhao Shuyun, a female detective from the General Inspection Office of the General Police Station, learned that Hua Liu, a Ningbo woman, was engaged in selling firearms privately, violating the security of the settlement. She reported to the director and contacted the woman, agreeing to buy two new German-style pistols and 200 bullets for 80 yuan. Detective Zhao gave 80 yuan, secretly marking the bills, and agreed to meet at Room 320 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road at 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. Detective Zhao, along with Chinese Detective Chief Tang Jian, Detective Feng Zhiming, and Western Detective Chief Hunter, went to the hotel and waited until 11:15 a.m. Hua Liu came and was arrested. Two pistols and 200 bullets were confiscated. She confessed that her accomplice was Li Chen, a Ningbo woman, who lived at No. 885 Broadway Road. The detectives went and arrested Li, confiscating the 80 yuan paid by Detective Zhao. Then, the board of her vanity was found to be movable. The board was lifted, revealing a cavity, presumably used to hide firearms. Then, the woman and the banknotes were taken back to the police station and sent to the Special District Court the morning before yesterday. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer of the police station, explained the situation and requested a postponement because the accomplices still needed to be investigated. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection. Li Chen claimed that her husband, Li Jinfu, was working on a foreign warship. These guns and bullets were entrusted to her by a certain person who was on the run to sell them on his behalf and were not hers. Lawyer Fan Gang was hired to defend her. Zhou Han, the chief of the criminal court, verified the confession and ordered the two defendants to be detained and investigated again at a later date.</p>

<p>Inevitably, Emotionally Severing the Seed of Emotion</p>
<p>Having No Means to Make a Living, He Throws Himself into the River to End His Life</p>
<p>Liu Zhuxian, from Wuxi, 35 years old, formerly worked as an accountant at the Quanyuan Teahouse on Xin Zha Road. Last year, he suddenly had an affair and subsequently rented a small house in Pudong to cohabit with his mistress. This led to huge expenses and an inability to make ends meet. As a result, he embezzled funds from the shop, which was discovered by the boss, and he was dismissed. Seeing that Liu's business had been terminated, and fearing that life would be difficult in the future, the woman secretly absconded without a trace a few days ago. Out of anger and resentment, Liu used a small knife to completely cut off his two testicles on the Bund yesterday afternoon, placed them in a bag, and took a ferry to Pudong. As soon as the ferry arrived at the dock, Liu jumped into the river. Patrolman No. 35 of the Water Police Station managed to rescue him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, his life is feared to be in danger.</p>

<p>Six Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</p>
<p>Lu A'huai, from Shaoxing, has been working as a shop assistant at a certain department store at No. 22 Kunshan Road for three years. The employers, a Japanese couple named Hachiro, trusted Lu very much because he was considered to be honest and trustworthy. At the end of last month, they ordered Lu to deposit 1,600 silver dollars at the Yokohama Specie Bank. Lu suddenly had the idea of embezzling the money and gambled with it. In an instant, he lost 460 dollars. Fearing further losses from continued gambling, he returned the remaining funds to the mistress of the house and said that he would return to his hometown to sell his property to repay the debt, begging them not to report him to the authorities. Hachiro agreed. Later, seeing that Lu had no preparations to leave Shanghai, he suspected that the talk of selling the property was just an excuse. He reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station. The day before yesterday morning, Lu was arrested and taken to the Special District Local Court. The Japanese also appeared in court, stating that if he could repay the debt, they would request leniency. When questioned, Lu confessed and said he was willing to go home immediately to sell his property and repay the debt. Judge Feng ruled that the crime of embezzlement had been established, sentenced him to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and released him on bail.</p>

<p>Merchants Request Protection from the Sixth District</p>
<p>Villagers from inland areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang who transport their produce to Shanghai for sale must pass through the Caojiadu area in western Shanghai. Recently, there have often been groups of individuals resembling hoodlums who gather followers and distribute themselves in places such as Zhoujiaqiao and Caojiadu in western Shanghai. Whenever rural boats carrying vegetables and other goods come to Shanghai, they step forward to block them, forcing them to sell at a low price to designated firms so that they can profit from the middle. If the boatmen resist, they show their guns to threaten them. Therefore, the boatmen are often afraid and suffer losses. It is now known that brick and tile firms such as Zhang Xiehe, Tan Yiji, Xu Yongshun, and Zhang Xingji in Caojiadu ordered lime, bricks, and tiles from the inland, which were transported to Shanghai yesterday. Unexpectedly, individuals resembling hoodlums named Ma and Wang blocked the ships, claiming they were sent by the No. 1 Brick and Tile Cooperative on Ningbo Road in Shanghai and that the goods had to be transported to Shanghai and sold within the cooperative. The boatmen slightly argued and refused. Ma and Wang even pulled out their guns, forcing them to transport the goods. Therefore, each firm like Zhang Xiehe urgently needs those goods for their customers. They were forced to ask for help because they suffer great losses because of that illegal act. Yesterday, they reluctantly submitted a joint petition to the Sixth District Police Station, requesting them to send police to protect them and investigate and punish the perpetrators in order to safeguard the merchants.</p>

<p>Fellow Townsman Asks for a Hundred-Family Lock</p>
<p>Kong Jiaoben, a Ningbo native residing in the Fan Family Residence in the rural area of Hongzhen in eastern Shanghai, was watching a play at the Jiangbei Theater near Hujia Wooden Bridge the night before last when a fellow townsman, Ye A'li, asked Kong for a copper coin, planning to collect coins from a hundred people to buy a hundred-family silver lock for his young child. Unexpectedly, Kong sternly refused, leading to an argument. The next day, Ye carried a handgun, intending to seek trouble with Kong. Kong had already gone with his elder brother Kong Liang and three friends to find Ye at Zhenxingli, Feihong Road. They encountered him at the entrance of Zhenxingli, and Ye, isolated and helpless, was grabbed and beaten by Kong and his companions, resulting in a bloody head injury. The handgun on Ye's person was also taken by Kong and the others. After being injured, Ye did not report to the police station but went to the hospital for treatment. The next day, Kong brought the gun and reported the incident to the Third Sub-station of the Fifth District. After questioning by Chief Yao, who learned the details, police were sent to Zhenxingli to bring Ye's father, Ye Jiaren, to the station to inquire about where his son's handgun came from. Ye's father firmly denied that the gun belonged to his son. Chief Yao, noting that Kong had taken the gun home and only reported it the next day, found the circumstances strange. Yesterday, he sent a thousand witnesses along with the case to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Supervision Was Improper</p>
<p>What Exactly Happened?</p>
<p>Zhang Ye, a rural woman, 42 years old, residing in the Lu Family Residence, Tangqiao, Pudong, has a son named Jin Tao, 15 years old. Two years ago, he was introduced by a neighbor, Monk Lu, to learn the craft at Yao Fuxing's shoe store at No. 609, Limalu, Wangjia Pier, Nanshi. The store owner, Yao Jinsheng, is naturally violent, so if the apprentice's work is not to his liking, he readily beats him. A few days ago, Jin Tao was severely scolded by his master for a trivial matter. Jin Tao felt that this was not a place to stay for long, so he secretly ran away from his master. Before long, he was found by his master. Yao could not contain his anger and used a huge iron chain to lock Jin Tao's feet, preventing him from moving. He also beat him with a wooden stick, causing Jin Tao to be injured all over his body. When Jin Tao's mother heard about this, she rushed to the store with the matchmaker, Monk Chen, at about 3 p.m. yesterday for a major negotiation. The two sides disagreed and a dispute arose. The watchman police, Cheng Jie, from the twelfth post in the area, heard about it and arrived to inquire about the cause of the conflict. He brought the man with his witness to the First Sub-station of the First District. The chief conducted a preliminary trial. The family complained about the events and requested an investigation. Yao, 34 years old, from Pudong, confessed that his apprentice, Zhang Jin Tao, often secretly took goods from the store, went out to exchange them for money, and often stole silver coins. When he found out, he slightly beat him, and he would run away privately. The day before yesterday, he stole five pairs of leather shoes from the store and six silver dollars. Just as he was trying to sell the leather shoes, he was discovered and dragged back to the store. He only beat him slightly before he ran away again. Out of desperation, he had no choice but to lock his feet with chains to prevent him from escaping again. He was ordered to be detained separately pending investigation.</p>

His wife, Xie, 21 years old, went to a matchmaker shop on Sanjiao Street a month ago, entrusting them to introduce her to a job as a maid because she was concerned about the family's poverty. Unexpectedly, she was soon lured by a man named Wang Kaizi to a small inn near the Shanghai military camp for illicit cohabitation. Wang even cheated the woman out of her clothes and pawned them. Shen, after losing his wife, searched everywhere without a trace. He finally found her the day before yesterday, inquired about the events, and had no choice but to accept his misfortune. He went out with her to redeem her pawned clothes. Unexpectedly, Wang Kaizi learned about it and secretly gathered Wang A'san and others to ambush them on the way. They beat Shen recklessly. Shen shouted for help, and the watchman police, Sun Shaozhen, from the twenty-fifth post in the area, heard the sound and rushed over. Wang Kaizi had already escaped, and only Wang A'san was caught.

<p>Lu Jiupeng hired a lawyer to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the French Concession, stating that the plaintiff and the defendant, Luo Yanfu, had formed a partnership as compradores in the American-owned Jinlong Tobacco Company. They agreed on a contract that all expenses would be paid by the plaintiff. Subsequently, the plaintiff successively paid more than 24,503 dollars. After repaying 5,000 dollars, more than 19,000 dollars were still owed. Later, due to the lack of goods to sell, the partnership agreement was cancelled. The defendant issued a promissory note with a limited time for repayment, guaranteed by Chen Zuming and Guanhua Hat Shop. However, the hat shop has closed down, and Chen has disappeared. The court was requested to summon Luo Yanfu to court to investigate and recover the debt. The defendant, Luo Yanfu, also hired a lawyer to represent him, stating that the defendant had left town for business and would not return to Shanghai for about two months. He requested an adjournment for further trial. Judge Gong approved the request for a seven-day postponement and ordered the defendant to appear in court in person for further investigation.</p>

After he is no longer in danger, he will be taken back to the police station for questioning. Therefore, his name, age, and reason for suicide are not yet clear.</p>

<p>Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Four Cases Discussed</p>
<p>All tenants of Fengyuli, Sapo Sai Road, French Concession, opposed the landlord's coercion to sign harsh contracts and held their first preparatory meeting at Lisheng Middle School in Xichengli at 4 p.m. yesterday. More than 30 tenant representatives attended. Tong Gongnu was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. A ceremony was held. Commissioner Yu, sent by the Housing Association, attended and guided the meeting. The following matters were reported: (1) The chairman reported on the renaming of the landlord Huifu Company to Dali and the situation of forcing tenants to sign contracts. (2) Tenant representatives Wu Wenlan and Hu Peiru expressed their opinions, stating that the landlord's profit from building houses exceeds the normal rate of one point by as much as three points. The interest rate on houses should not exceed one point at most, and the standard is usually eight percent. Now that the landlord has such a large interest, he is still not satisfied and wants to raise the rent. It seems that we tenants must unite and deal with it together. (3) Tenants reported that the security in the neighborhood is weak, resulting in frequent theft cases. The Sikh police officers do not carry weapons. Even if there are thieves, they can only let them do as they please. This matter is of great importance to the safety of the tenants. In the future, the landlord will be asked to pay attention to the protection of the tenants. (4) Tenants Ye and Deng reported that the landlord had entrusted lawyer Lin to issue a notice to vacate the house on the grounds of rent arrears and requested assistance. Discussion Matters: (1) It was resolved to organize a tenant union and submit it to the higher authorities for filing. (2) Raising funds: each storefront will contribute one silver dollar and additional funds will be contributed voluntarily at any time. (3) Hu Peiru, Wu Wenlan, Ye Qiangya, Xu Ruiyuan, Zhang Songrong, Fang Jiafen, Tong Gongnu, Huang Laotai and other nine people were elected as secretaries. (4) All application procedures will be handled separately by each preparation member. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Self-Government and the Provisional Constitution by Pan Gongzhan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>A Record of a Speech Delivered at the Shanghai Municipal Local Self-Government Training Institute on March 10th of the 20th Year.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the topic of my speech today is called Self-Government and the Provisional Constitution. I want to briefly explain the relationship between the Provisional Constitution and self-government during the period of political tutelage. Before I begin, let me first roughly describe what the existing Provisional Constitutions of the Republic of China and the Provisional Constitution advocated by the Kuomintang's leader Sun Yat-sen were all about. We know that the Republic of China did have a Provisional Constitution, namely the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic (1912). After the Second Revolution, Yuan Shikai, preparing to become emperor, dissolved the National Assembly and abolished the Provisional Constitution. At this time, our party leader reorganized the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party, preparing to fight again for our principles and for the Republic of China. We coordinated in the Southwest to oppose Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor. Yuan Shikai ultimately failed. This revolutionary war can be said to be the National Protection War or the War to Defend the Constitution. The meaning of defending the Constitution is to maintain the Provisional Constitution. After Yuan's death, Li Yuanhong succeeded him as President and ordered the convening of the National Assembly to abide by the Provisional Constitution. However, not long after, in the sixth year of the Republic (1917), Zhang Xun plotted to restore the monarchy and forced him to dissolve the National Assembly again. At that time, Mr. Wu Tingfang and others came to the South to follow Sun Yat-sen in convening an extraordinary National Assembly in Guangzhou to engage in the constitutional protection movement. Later, Wu Peifu of the North turned against the government, and Li Yuanhong reconvened the Sixth National Assembly of the Republic, with Cao Kun bribing his way to the presidency and promulgating a constitution on October 10th of the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), which we call the "Cao Kun Constitution." There were many twists and turns in between. Why do I report this segment of history? It is to make you understand that the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution have both existed in the history of the Republic of China. However, whether the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution are effective depends entirely on whether the people are law-abiding. If there are no law-abiding people, even if there is a Provisional Constitution or a Constitution, it is just a piece of paper and will not be effective. Therefore, we hope that everyone will act within the scope of the law and not think that everything will be fine with the law. With this concept, I am afraid that we will still inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past. Therefore, I have briefly reported the past history.</p>
<p>Now that the central government wants to formulate a Provisional Constitution when convening the National Assembly, we certainly hope to have a Provisional Constitution and at the same time hope to have law-abiding people. If there are no law-abiding people, we will repeat the mistakes of the past. Now, the Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government have resolved to establish a Provisional Constitution, and Sun Yat-sen has always advocated the rule of law and democracy. When others destroyed the Provisional Constitution, he wanted to defend the Constitution. Although the Second Revolution failed, he had to continue to work hard to achieve the final victory. Now, I will talk about the Kuomintang's repeated propositions on the Provisional Constitution. The First National Congress was convened by Sun Yat-sen himself when he was alive. The manifesto of the congress is the crystallization of the congress. The manifesto of the First National Congress criticized the four schools of thought on national salvation at that time. The first was the constitutional monarchists, who advocated that as long as there is a Constitution, China can be saved. Therefore, there is a paragraph in the manifesto: "...Since the first year of the Republic, there has been a Constitution, but the remnants of autocracy, warlords, and bureaucrats have usurped power and committed all kinds of evils..." This refers to the Cao Kun clique. There are also "...Unless these people are removed, the Constitution will not take effect..." This means that warlords and bureaucrats like Cao Kun used the Constitution to usurp positions. Little do they know that if there is a Constitution but no law-abiding people, the Constitution is also useless. Therefore, the manifesto of the First National Congress clearly stated that the constitutionalist proposition cannot save the country. The second is the provincial autonomy faction. This faction was at its peak in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic (1919-1920). They argued that China is too big, so it is better for the provinces to become autonomous. However, the manifesto of the First National Congress pointed out that the proposition of this faction is not really to save the country but that a small number of warlords want to use this pretext to carve up territories. The figures of this faction include Chen Jiongming, Tang Jiyao, and Zhao Hengti. Sun Yat-sen did not oppose autonomy. Autonomy must be discussed after the country is truly unified. The period of political tutelage is to start from local autonomy. Only when the people have the ability to govern themselves can the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution be guaranteed. The period of political tutelage is the period of implementing local autonomy, which naturally has to be after the revolutionary army has settled down.</p>
<p>Speaking of this point, the Kuomintang should have completed the Northern Expedition long ago from the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926) to the Northern Expedition in the twentieth year of the Republic (1931). However, for the past four or five years since the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth years of the Republic (1928-1930), warlords have successively stirred up trouble, and construction has not been able to progress. For the past four or five years, the central government has been working hard to suppress the rebels. Until last year, the Yan-Feng reactionary group was formed. This was the final battle between the Kuomintang and the reactionaries. Although the final goal of the revolution has not been achieved, the National Revolution has also achieved considerable victories. Its environment should be different from the past. At this time, if the Kuomintang does not talk about the Provisional Constitution, does not do local self-government work, and does not work hard on political tutelage and construction, then the Kuomintang has become a liar. In the period of military administration, military law is used. After the revolutionary army unifies the country, it is the period of political tutelage. Military law is naturally not applicable. The period of political tutelage is to talk about the law. Of course, a Provisional Constitution is needed. Several comrades in the central government want to discuss the Provisional Constitution when convening the National Assembly. This kind of Provisional Constitution is the Provisional Constitution of the period of political tutelage, and it is also the Provisional Constitution that should be jointly observed by the whole country during the period of political tutelage. The manifesto of the First National Congress pointed out that the constitutional monarchists are liars, and the provincial autonomy faction is also liars. The Kuomintang, in view of the mistakes of the past, advocated that after the period of military administration, there should be a Provisional Constitution in the period of political tutelage. Although the Outline of National Reconstruction has only twenty-five articles, it clearly stipulates the work of the three periods of military administration, political tutelage, and constitutional government. Whenever a province or county is within the reach of the National Government, it is the beginning of political tutelage. Furthermore, in the manifesto of the Tongmenghui (1905), even before the Republic of China, in addition to the four principles in the manifesto, there were three periods: (1) the rule of military law (i.e., the period of military administration), (2) the rule of the Provisional Constitution (the period of political tutelage), and (3) the rule of the Constitution (the period of constitutional government). It can be seen that the division of the three periods of military administration, political tutelage, and constitutional government was decided as early as the Tongmenghui era. Furthermore, in the sixth chapter of Sun Yat-sen's teachings, there is a paragraph: "...The period of revolutionary progress is divided into three: first, the period of military administration, second, the period of political tutelage, and third, the period of constitutional government..." Below is an explanation: "The second is the period of destruction. It is planned to implement military law during this period, with the revolutionary army taking on the responsibility of breaking the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty, eliminating the corruption of the bureaucracy, reforming the bad habits of customs, relieving the inequality of slaves, washing away the flow of opium, destroying the superstition of feng shui, and removing the obstacles of likin, etc..." The work of the period of military administration is to use military force to eliminate bureaucrats and warlords, as well as to wash away the opium scourge and likin. However, opium has not been eradicated to this day. If during the period of military administration, those who plant opium, sell opium, and use opium were punished by military law, there would be no opium at this time. However, this kind of work was not done during the period of military administration. Now, during the period of political tutelage, it is more difficult to do this kind of work. For example, the abolition of likin was also done during the period of military administration. It was not until January 1, 1931, that likin was abolished throughout the country. These are all due to the failure to do the work of the period of military administration during the period of military administration. The second is the transition period. The meaning of transition is the middle between the period of destruction and the period of construction, which is called the transition period. Below is an explanation: "...It is planned to implement the Provisional Constitution (not the current one) during this period, build local autonomy, and promote the development of civil rights, with a county as the unit of autonomy, and the county further divided into rural areas..." This paragraph has the four words "not the current one." Its meaning refers to the so-called Provisional Constitution, not the then-current Provisional Constitution. It can be seen that Sun Yat-sen's proposition has always been consistent, that is, during the period of political tutelage, there should be a Provisional Constitution that builds local autonomy and promotes the development of civil rights. Although the Outline of National Reconstruction has only a few articles, its spirit is focused on local autonomy. As for the beginning of the period of political tutelage, Article 7 of the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly stipulates that "the day when a province is completely settled is the time when political tutelage begins, and the day when military administration ceases." For example, when the National Revolutionary Army arrives in Zhejiang and then from Zhejiang to Jiangsu, the military affairs of Zhejiang are considered settled, which is the beginning of the period of political tutelage. Articles 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of the Outline of National Reconstruction all focus on local autonomy and the new work of local autonomy, such as investigating the population, surveying land, organizing police affairs, improving sanitation, expanding education, and building roads, etc. The processing time is tentatively set at three years. If the above matters are handled well within three years, the people can elect the county magistrate. If the above matters can be handled well in less than three years, the county magistrate can also be elected by the people. If every county in a province can do this, it is the beginning of the period of constitutional government, and the provincial governor can also be elected by the people. The autonomy advocated by Sun Yat-sen starts from the lower level, not like Cao Kun, Chen Jiongming, and others who hang up the signboard of law or autonomy and use it as their tool. If more than half of the provinces in the country have provincial governors elected by the people and have completed local autonomy, then a National Assembly can be convened at this time (which is different in nature from the National Conference to be convened now) to determine the Constitution and promulgate it. The day the Constitution is promulgated is the completion of constitutional government. At that time, the National Government is completely an elected government. It can be seen that the Provisional Constitution of the period of political tutelage is the law that everyone jointly observes during the period of political tutelage. Its nature is different from that of the Constitution. See Article 22 of the Outline of National Reconstruction: "The draft Constitution should be based on the achievements of the Outline of National Reconstruction and the two periods of political tutelage and constitutional government, and should be discussed by the Legislative Yuan and publicized to the public at any time for selection and implementation at that time." It can be seen that the Constitution should refer to the achievements of the two periods and be drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and then submitted to the National Assembly for a vote and promulgated it. Therefore, the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen especially paid attention to striving for local autonomy during the period of political tutelage. Therefore, for the work done in local autonomy, the Local Autonomy Beginning Implementation Law, such as clearing the population, establishing institutions, setting land prices, building roads, reclaiming wasteland, establishing schools, is stipulated in detail. In the future, when formulating the Provisional Constitution, we must infuse this spirit into it, so that it will not be empty. During the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang wants to enable the people to receive training in exercising the four powers. The National Conference is an opportunity for the government and the people to cooperate. The meaning of the two words "Provisional Constitution" is the public agreement between the people and the government. In other words, it is everyone's joint contract. If the Provisional Constitution stipulates 100 articles, everyone must jointly abide by these 100 articles of the contract. Formulating the Provisional Constitution is to summarize all of Sun Yat-sen's teachings, consider the needs of the times, and abide by the guidelines of political tutelage, and write a few articles neatly so that everyone can jointly abide by them during the period of political tutelage. This law, whether it is for party members or non-party members, the government and the people must abide by it. The meaning of setting the Provisional Constitution is that Chairman Chiang and Committee Member Dai Jitao have made it very clear at the central memorial week, that it is to set the Provisional Constitution for the permanent peace, unification, and construction of the country. Therefore, if the Provisional Constitution does not pay attention to the cultivation of local autonomy and the purpose of completing unification and construction, it will not be able to achieve the Provisional Constitution. If the Provisional Constitution only pays attention to the provisions of the presidential system, cabinet system, council system, and bicameral system, and ignores the scope of work of the period of political tutelage stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction, in other words, ignores local autonomy, then the Provisional Constitution in the future may be equal to the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic, and not the Provisional Constitution that Sun Yat-sen hoped for.</p>
<p>If someone wants to ask why we need to formulate the Provisional Constitution when we already have Sun Yat-sen's teachings, in fact, formulating the Provisional Constitution is for the people to easily understand Sun Yat-sen's teachings and to facilitate joint compliance. Therefore, formulating the Provisional Constitution, on the one hand, cannot violate Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and on the other hand, it must train the general public to thoroughly comply with the Provisional Constitution from top to bottom. If there is a law, but there are no law-abiding people, this law is still useless. To have law-abiding people, we must cultivate local self-government talents. If you understand this point, you should know that your own responsibilities are very important. After you graduate from this research here, there is still a lot of work to be done in the future. Don't think that these three months are for learning, and you don't have to learn outside. You are learning outside all the time, and these learnings are still real learnings. What you are learning now is just learning the articles of the local autonomy regulations and the items of the local autonomy cause. Therefore, the real learning is to learn in society. The responsibilities you bear are very heavy. I hope you will work hard. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e141">A Record of the Four Caves on South Hill, West Lake <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Xing</p>
<p>I previously read in "Free Talk" about the scenic spots of the Four Caves, such as Ziyun Cave, but they were all along the North Hill route. The Four Caves on South Hill were not mentioned at all. I am now providing a supplementary account.</p>
<p>Climbing the steps from Yangmei Ridge, one reaches Yanxia Cave. The cave is surrounded by a bamboo fence, providing a place for tourists to rest their sedan chairs. The entrance to the cave is not wide, and the depth is only about ten steps, so the cave is not very dark or damp. The stone walls inside the cave are carved with hundreds of small Buddha statues, each with a different appearance. However, they are not as vivid or majestic as those carved on Feilai Peak. At the bottom of the cave wall, there is a small hole, only about a foot in diameter, which is unusually dark. When you reach in, you feel a biting cold. If you throw a stone into it, you cannot hear it falling. Some say that this cave leads to Mount Tianmu. Such idle talk is not worth a knowing person's smile.</p>
<p>Turning left from Yanxia Cave and descending, passing a pavilion, one reaches Shuile Cave. The cave has two entrances, one on the left and one on the right. The cold air inside the cave chills one to the bone. Even in the height of summer, it feels like late autumn. A monk has set up tables and chairs to entertain guests and orders a young monk to carry a lantern to guide them to explore the bottom of the cave. The cave is about a hundred or several tens of feet deep and about eight or nine feet wide. It is very damp inside. Water trickles down the stone walls. Even though there is a cement path, it is still muddy and slippery. Walking along the wall for about ten steps, there are stone lotus roots and stone bamboos standing opposite each other, but they do not look very realistic. This is probably not the work of humans. Further in, the width only allows for one person to pass. On the left, there is a stone drum, which makes a sound when struck. The stone bell on the right is only similar in shape and cannot actually make a bell sound. Further in, one cannot hold one's head high and must stoop to walk. The sound of water gurgles underfoot, making it eerie and frightening. Just as one reaches the bottom of the cave, one sees a torrent of cold spring water rushing down, which is truly spectacular. There is also a small hole at the bottom of the cave. The monk said that it could still be opened up, but the project would be huge.</p>
<p>Climbing up from Shuile Cave, one reaches Shiwu Cave. The temple outside the cave is clean and tidy, the best of the caves. The flowers and trees are lush, and the ponds and stones are elegant, resembling a secluded paradise. It cannot be compared to the desolation of the other caves. The four walls inside the cave are also carved with Buddha statues of varying sizes. The cave is very shallow, so it is still bright. The ground is also not wet. In the center of the cave, there is a square pond. The spring water creates whirlpools, just like Tiger Spring. The monk puts a bowl in the water, saying that if someone can throw money into it, they have a karmic connection with the Buddha. Foolish men and women all scramble to open their purses, so they accumulate at the bottom of the pond. The monk's method of collecting money cannot be said to be clumsy. Next to the cave, there are more than ten stone steps. There is another cave with only four walls, nothing worth seeing. When a stone is thrown into the bottom of the cave, there is a rushing sound, which is the downstream of the pond spring.</p>
<p>Walking up the mountain from the back door of the Shiwu Cave temple, one soon sees a small cave appearing in the rugged rocks, commonly known as the Immortal Cave. The entrance to the cave is narrow and unbearable, and one must bow one's head to enter. The cave is only large enough to accommodate a small statue of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty. The monk said that when the Jin soldiers were chasing Emperor Gaozong during the Southern Crossing, the emperor hid in this cave for seven days and nights. Later, he took the throne in Lin'an, thus protecting half of Jiangnan. This is probably just unfounded talk. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3 id="e142">On the Matter of the Scripture-Chanting Beggar Zhu Si <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>A peculiar beggar came to our town some time ago. He wandered along the road, chanting the Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra every day to earn a living. People were happy to buy his services because he chanted the sutra earnestly and did not do it casually. When asked about it, the beggar would say, "I committed serious sins in the first half of my life, and I am afraid of falling into hell after death, so I use this to repent. Moreover, when people get my sutra, they also accumulate some merit." My cousin Yuquan, who lives in Jiashan, told me about this beggar in great detail, so I wrote it down.</p>
<p>The beggar's surname is Zhu, and his given name is A Si. He is from Jiashan, Zhejiang. His elder brother is the second in his lineage and is a wealthy man in the village. Zhu was extremely poor. Some people urged him to go and live with his elder brother. Zhu would arrogantly reply, "How can that be? Suffering is just a common thing. Do I want to get rich today? My brother is indeed wealthy in the village, but what about after his death?" After saying this, he would act disdainfully and leave. At first, Zhu's family was not poor. He had a fondness for pleasures since he was young. He once took a thousand gold pieces to the sea and wandered among the brothels. He returned after spending all his money, without any complaints. He also said that it was a great joy to spend money on women. If one regards money as one's life, then one is extremely foolish. When he said this, he would quote Gong Ding'an's line, "I wish to have ten million taels of gold to befriend all the famous scholars and beauties in the world," to boast about himself. His boldness and unruliness were like this. Soon after, he suddenly disappeared. Ten years later, he suddenly returned as a beggar. His face was haggard and his clothes were tattered. He begged along the streets every day and made a living by catching snakes. His skills were excellent and unparalleled. Therefore, the ruffians in the village all took him as their teacher. His name for catching snakes spread throughout Zhejiang. However, the general's chicken may die in battle. Zhu, who was good at catching snakes, ended up losing his sight in a certain mountain in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. At first, his disciples still supported him every year and did not neglect him in the slightest. However, Zhu did not want to live off others, so he left and traveled all over Jiangsu and Zhejiang, repenting by begging and chanting scriptures. He had killed living beings wantonly when he was young, and his sins were so deep that he still hoped to lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha immediately. The beggar Zhu is worthy of praise. Therefore, I wrote down his story to satirize the world.</p>
<h3 id="e143">An Examination of Ancient Women's Adornments <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Fu</p>
<p>▲I once traveled to Tianjin and Shanghai and jokingly discussed stories of ancient women's adornments with two or three close friends. However, as the ancient times are far away, their meanings are gradually blurred. Listening to the rain by the banana window, sitting idly and bored, I jotted them down haphazardly.</p>
<p>▲The pei is a type of skirt. In "Miscellaneous Records of Women's Needlework," Yan Zhao Wang bestowed on Xuan Juan a mountain poem: "Lowering her head, she sees her slanted hair, dragging clouds and playing with a slender pei."</p>
<p>▲The ru is a type of jacket. In the ancient poem "Shang Sang," "Yellow silk is the lower skirt, purple silk is the upper ru." In Yu Ji's poem, "For no reason, a pair of butterflies fly onto the purple silk ru."</p>
<p>▲The jue are shoes. The palace women of Emperor Donghun of Qi all wore green silk jue.</p>
<p>▲The zan is used to hold up hair. In ancient times, men had full hair, so men also used them. In Li Shanfu's poem "Poor Woman," "In her life, she has never known embroidered clothes, but she secretly grieves while holding a thorn hairpin."</p>
<p>▲The dian is a golden head ornament. In Liu Xiaowei's "Lotus Picking Song," "Dewdrops sometimes wet the bracelet, and wind stalks lightly brush the dian."</p>
<p>▲The chai is a forked hairpin for women. In Liang Huang's "Sleeping Beauty in Spring Poem," "A fallen hairpin still hangs in her sideburns, and light sweat wants to melt the yellow."</p>
<p>▲The sheng is a head ornament. During the Han Dynasty, it was called Hua Sheng.</p>
<p>▲The tiaotuo is a bracelet. There are two types, gold and jade. In "Complete Tang Poetry Anecdotes," Emperor Xuanzong once composed a poem, with the line "golden buyao" but could not find a matching line. Wen Tingjun's talent and beauty filled the line "jade tiaotuo" after it. Emperor Xuanzong appreciated it. Su Shi's "Crisp Cake Poem" says, "Last night's spring sleep was stronger than wine, pressing down on the beautiful woman's wrapped gold arm," note: This is the gold tiaotuo.</p>
<p>▲The buyao is a crown ornament for empresses. In "Seven Edicts," "Wearing the glittering golden buyao, waving the paired jade quills."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Rise Late in Life <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>A person's childhood is the developmental age, middle age is the educational age, and old age is the rising age. Therefore, the success of a great man's career often comes after the age of fifty. Conversely, a person who achieves success in his youth often does not last long. This claim is not nonsense on my part. Not only is there evidence to prove it, but it can also be inferred by ordinary people. Because middle age is still the preparatory age, and rising to prominence in middle age is often due to chance. The foundation is not solid, and collapse is a concern. What do you think, right or wrong?</p>
<p>The Secretary-General of the British Parliament is a good position, a transitional stage for promoting ministers. All the famous ministers of the United Kingdom have come from the Secretary-General. This also shows the superiority of the Secretary-General's position. The most recent person to hold this position is Frank Smith. He only took this position last year and is 76 years old. His superior, George Lansbury, is also someone who rose to prominence late in life. Although he once entered Parliament as a member in 1910, he was not appointed to an important government position until he was 70 years old. In addition, the current British Minister of Aviation, the Duke of Ambery, also appeared on the political stage as late as the age of 70. It can also be seen that life at seventy is not old, and it is not empty talk to say that one is stronger in old age.</p>
<p>The matter of rising late in life is not only found in the political world, but also in various other careers. There was an old man in Sweden named Han Erfansheng. He recently died at the age of 102. Most of his life's work was spent on farming. When he grew older and his arm strength gradually weakened, his spirit remained the same. He abandoned farming and engaged in fishing and hunting. He did not discourage himself because of his old age and relearned the art of shooting. A year before his death, he also won the championship in a shooting competition in Sweden.</p>
<p>Jiang Taigong met King Wen at the age of eighty. His great career was all achieved above the age of eighty. Therefore, a person's failure in his youth is not worth worrying about, and one should not be discouraged by old age and weakness. I deeply hope that those who read my article will think deeply about it.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Advocating Shuttlecock Kicking <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bing</p>
<p>The customs of our country vary from place to place, but the game of kicking shuttlecock is popular in both the north and the south. Its origins are quite ancient and, like swinging on a swing, it is a beneficial exercise. In previous years, Mr. Chu Minyi of my hometown vigorously advocated kicking shuttlecock, saying that this game involves the movement of all parts of the body. The eyes, hands, and feet are all connected. It is truly an excellent method to promote health and develop physical strength. His words are good and are welcomed by those who care about sports. The method of kicking shuttlecock varies slightly across the country. In my hometown, it is customary to take advantage of the cold winter and spring weather to ward off the cold. As for the innovative patterns, there are various names such as sweeping, jumping, lifting, and circling. Generally, the names differ depending on the kicking method. Judging by its classification, there are no less than dozens of items. However, in my hometown, the loser is only fined one chip. In the competitions in Fujian Province, sweets and peanuts are used as prizes. This probably increases the interest of both parties, but it is rare to see money used for winning or losing.</p>
<p>According to a friend, the Manchus also liked the game of kicking shuttlecock after entering the Central Plains. On good days in early spring, both young and old would gather. The shuttlecocks were made with particular care, with feathers attached to them. They were generally divided into red, black, yellow, and white, and of various weights and lengths, each according to their preference. This can be said to be a particularly elaborate study. The experts in this art in Beijing can not only kick with both feet, but also kick with the top of their heads without looking back, and without the shuttlecock falling to the ground. The skill and proficiency is not easy to achieve without years of effort.</p>
<p>Shuttlecock was also popular in Europe in ancient times. In the heyday of Rome, the common people quite liked it. However, the shuttlecocks used long feathers and were relatively large. One must choose an opponent to pass it back and forth. The patterns used by the feet were simpler than those of the habitually practicing in our country. Later, with the rise of tennis, its method was based on kicking shuttlecock. Therefore, after the fourteenth century, shuttlecock fell behind, and tennis gradually became an important sport. The English name for shuttlecock is Shuttle Cock. It can be seen that England also had this game in ancient times. The above was said by Mr. Shen. Shen studied in England in the past, so it seems to be not without basis.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Travelogue of India (15) <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>3rd. Mr. Sita took me to visit the Victoria Memorial Palace. We departed from the university by car. Each person paid two annas. Upon arrival, we entered through the north gate. There were lion statues on both sides. At the main gate, two bronze cannons were displayed. Patrols in red caps and leather belts guarded the place like a royal ceremony. Once inside, there were many patrols, as if it were a forbidden palace. Below, various oil paintings were displayed, all portraits of Queen Victoria. On the upper level, in the inner sections, were portraits of her husband, Albert, and son, Edward. There were portraits of Queen Victoria at her coronation and baptism, various portraits from her youth to old age, portraits of her on horseback, portraits of her writing letters, and the last letter she sent to India. Observing her attire in full dress, the train was very long, requiring someone to drag it from behind. Previously, I had seen in movies that the trains of Western women's court dresses could be as long as twenty feet. The attire of Chinese imperial consorts and their phoenix robes were all imitations of the beauty of birds' long tails. This is perhaps a universal principle of aesthetics, and proof that one person is not as naturally beautiful as a bird. I think long tails are rare to be longer than twenty feet. Their dignity is also comparable to that of noble concubines in the human world.</p>
<p>The dome of this palace is extremely solemn, reminding one of the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Summer Palace in Beijing. On the upper level, there are red-bearded patrols everywhere, as if facing an enemy. However, the displays are all landscapes and houses from various parts of India. There are also British artillery forts and scenes of soldiers and cannons drilling. There is a view of the Himalayas, with many Western-style houses on the mountains, used for escaping the heat of India. There are many incense burners displayed in various places, seemingly for burning incense, and many Indian men and women come to see them, reminding one of the imperial incense burners in the three main halls of Beiping. At the very top level is a dome, which is about twenty to thirty feet high and seems unattainable. It is entirely filled with various colorful portraits of the Queen, looking down at the central hall on the lower level. There is also a statue of the Queen. The south gate displays large and short cannons, two of which were seized from the French. Besides the Queen, there are many statues of military generals, civil officials, and female officials. The construction of this palace largely uses marble. When asked, the Indians said that this stone comes from North India and takes four or five days by train to arrive. The third level displays state documents and official papers, various British and Indian texts and seals, related to court matters. It is also interspersed with Indian customs and various scenes. This is the method of Westerners, to compare everything in the exhibition hall, showing the shortcomings of others by showing their own strengths, making people feel ashamed, admire, and surrender to the greatness of their politics, education, and art. Is this not great? We shall see in the future.</p>
<p>There are many plants in India. Entering the vegetable market, I recognize very few. The trees are tall and provide dense shade, which is better than being inside a room. There is no sunlight, and it is cool, so Indians like to lie on the ground, which is like paradise. We also like to sit under the trees when we come here. Therefore, the Buddha's teaching of sitting under a tree is a custom. Lying on the ground is also a teaching of the Buddha. Even today, Indians everywhere still like to lie on the ground. I have seen this everywhere in Singapore. At first, I thought it was strange, but now I know it is their custom. Pomegranates are very beautiful, similar to peaches and pears in China. Chili peppers are prevalent. Onions are especially common. Chili peppers are called "chili," which is what is meant by "eating chili rice." Indians do not pronounce it "kali," but "chili." The people of Ceylon especially like to eat cinnamon bark, which they consider a common food. I cannot bear it. Banana leaves are as large as mats and are used to wrap things. Walnuts are white and very large, similar to those in China. Sugar production is significant. There are sugar food and snack shops everywhere, which are quite delicious. The strange thing is that there are very few restaurants. This is very inconvenient for guests.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Education Investigates the Status of Students Studying Abroad <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to investigate the status of returned students and students studying abroad, sent official letters to various domestic and foreign institutions and embassies in Europe and America, stating: "Our country's dispatch of students to study abroad was originally intended to reserve specialized talents for construction, which is of great importance to the country's future. At this initial stage of political tutelage, there is an urgent need for talent. Whether the returned students from the past can meet the demand, and how the standards for future dispatch should be determined, must first be carefully investigated to have a basis. Therefore, the Ministry has formulated two types of survey forms: A. Survey form on the current service status of returned students in the country (such as the current service institution, the position held, the monthly salary, whether they have joined the party, the year of going abroad, whether they are self-funded or government-funded, which school they graduated from in the country, which country and school they graduated from, which subjects they studied, the degree obtained, experience, future plans, etc.); B. Survey form on students currently studying in various countries (such as the country of study, the subjects studied, the grade level, the current position of those who have not returned to the country after graduation, whether they are self-funded or government-funded, the various study expenses abroad, whether they have joined the party, etc.). The domestic and foreign students will be investigated simultaneously to compile statistics. In addition to being distributed, the corresponding forms are enclosed, and you are requested to fill them out and return them, and forward them to be filled out and sent directly to the Ministry for statistics."</p>

<p>Document Submitted by the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education submitted a document to the Executive Yuan stating: "According to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, after the provincial and municipal governments submit administrative plans to the Yuan on a quarterly basis, they should first be submitted to the ministries and commissions for review within their respective areas of responsibility. This has been notified and implemented. Now, the Nanjing Municipal Government has submitted the administrative plan for January to March of the 20th year to the Yuan. In addition to being distributed, the original plan is enclosed for your Ministry to review in detail within its area of responsibility and report back to the Yuan for review. Regarding the educational aspects of this plan, there are no major issues regarding social education, but regarding school education, the plans for the second semester and class levels seem to fail to consider the actual needs. The capital's education is related to the views of both domestic and foreign observers. The number of school-age children in the city who are out of school is around 30,000 and urgently needs relief. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Nanjing Municipal Government to pay close attention to educational administration and designate a certain percentage of the subsidies allocated by the Executive Yuan specifically for the promotion of elementary education. Please also order the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau to submit a special report to the Ministry for review on the progress of the promotion of elementary education in the past two and a half months. Whether this is appropriate is hereby submitted with the original plan for your review and implementation."</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Provincial Capital's Experimental Education Zone, affiliated with the Provincial Department of Education, has had its internal staff actively working. In addition to establishing a simple primary school in the First Floor Street to test preliminary educational methods, it was found that the survey of school-age children in the district last year did not have accurate statistics. Now that a year has passed, there must be many changes, so it was decided to conduct a second survey starting on the 6th of this month. Survey forms and verification certificates have been prepared, and Mr. Liu Fangshan and two other cadres of the district will be responsible for handling it. The Public Security Bureau has also been requested to assist in the process. It is reported that after the survey is completed, a plan will be formulated based on the statistical results to gradually add schools and establish grade levels each year.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Central Film and Cultural Propaganda Committee (Continued) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>(4) Propaganda of Culture: Culture is one of the three essential elements of establishing a country, and it should be promoted and expanded. It is clear that those in our country who study the West often have the problem of learning its superficial aspects without learning its spirit. Because of this, they despise the culture of their motherland and excessively worship foreigners. Foreign countries take advantage of this mentality to carry out their cultural aggression. Moreover, foreigners in general are almost completely ignorant of our country's culture. When they see yellow-skinned people with polite manners and neatly dressed men and women, they say they are Japanese. Beautiful Chinese goods are said to be Japanese goods. Those who have traveled to Europe and America can attest to this. Furthermore, there is a word in the French dictionary, Chinoiserie, which means cursing someone for being unclean. From this, it can be seen that the dignity of culture has such a close relationship with international status and national superiority. Can we not make every effort to promote it? The magnificence of our country's ancient capital, the Forbidden City, the grandeur of the imperial tombs and temples, the solemnity of various temples and monasteries, the greatness of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal, the exquisite craftsmanship of porcelain and art, the richness of the Siku Quanshu, and the simple folk customs of the inland all sufficiently demonstrate a long-standing and beautiful culture that can inspire admiration in foreigners. If systematic Chinese travel and visit films and historical films are made and screened in foreign countries, what would their public opinion and impact be like in a few years compared to today? On the contrary, the films made by foreigners, concerning inhuman acts, and the performances of adultery, theft, and slavery, are all performed by Chinese people. Their implied meaning is to make the general audience regard the Chinese nation as the world's earliest, most dirty, and culture-lacking nation, so that their countrymen can unite their efforts to eliminate this culture-lacking nation. Their intentions are extremely profound. All those who have traveled to foreign countries, upon seeing this, cannot help but feel heartbroken. In recent years, the study of film has become increasingly prosperous, and the Japanese have taken advantage of it to introduce various scientific inventions from Europe and America for reference. Therefore, their cultural progress has also been rapidly promoted. It can be seen that the relationship between the film industry and culture is important, and we must catch up urgently.</p>
<p>(5) Propaganda of Education: The foundation of a country lies in education. Film can especially supplement the shortcomings of education. Its function can transform social customs and improve public thought. For example, the League of Nations has specially established a film department to regulate the plots of films in various countries. Its intention is to prevent the incitement of people and specially produce films about the tyrannical behavior of the aristocracy during the imperial era to highlight the needs of their red ideology and to concentrate national thought. As for other films that use film to explore the North Pole, report on African news, travel notes, etc., to serve as political and scientific references, they are even more numerous. In medicine, such as the metamorphosis of microorganisms and the anatomy of the human body, etc.; in history, such as the great achievements of ancient heroes, the words and deeds of philosophers, etc.; in geography, such as the topography of mountains and rivers, the customs of various places, etc.; in the military, such as shooting training, the arrangement of the rear, etc.; in natural science, such as the extent of nature and inventions, etc.; in law, such as court trials of criminals and the circumstances of their trials, etc., all can supplement the shortcomings of education and increase the common sense of the public. Its extensive function can be called the most effective tool of propaganda, and nothing can surpass it. Today, our country's school education is neither common nor well-equipped, and social education is even more lacking. Regardless of international etiquette, even public morality and personal conduct are not emphasized. If we use films to demonstrate the actual conditions of social education in various countries, as well as the management of municipal, rural, and factory schools, etc., the benefits to our country's educational future would be boundless. The Western films we see today that describe their country's wealth and depict their licentiousness and extravagance are extremely harmful. How can we speak of benefits?</p>
<p>(6) Propaganda of Hygiene: The peace and tranquility of a country lies in the perfection of the country's organization, and the happiness of a person depends on the soundness of their body and mind. Unfortunately, our people are known as the "sick men of East Asia," which is extremely shameful. However, it is a fact that the majority of the people are physically and mentally unhealthy. This is all due to a lack of hygiene. Although the government has made every effort to promote new hygienic policies, the effect has not been great. Why is this? It is because of ingrained habits. If we look at the alleys and streets, they are filled with filth and garbage, all emitting foul odors that are unbearable. Even if we enforce the law, they still do not change or improve, because the public has no common sense of hygiene. Death and disease are what people fear, and strength and health are what people enjoy. However, why do they not know how to follow this path? It is because of a lack of propaganda. Now, if we use film to show the causes of disease and the rampant spread of germs, as well as the methods of strengthening the body and prolonging life, the public can gain a considerable amount of common sense. If the government supervises them from behind, not only will the nation become stronger day by day, but the habit of hygiene will be cultivated, and foreigners will also respect us. The increase in the nation's status is just the beginning. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Tennis King Henri Cochet Did Not Participate</p>
<p>Japanese Players Win Both Singles and Doubles Titles</p>
<p>(Paris Dispatch) This year's Davis Cup competition is about to begin, and players from various countries are now conserving their energy and preparing to compete with each other. France is particularly enthusiastic about tennis. The Poissy Cup Tennis Tournament was held in Canus on March 26, with players from England, Germany, France, Japan, and other countries participating. However, French tennis king Henri Cochet personally declined to participate in the tournament, intending to give the opportunity to those who came from afar. The Japanese players who attended were Sato Hyotaro and Sato Tsuyoshi. The two hurriedly participated in the tournament immediately after arriving in France. Sato Tsuyoshi was eliminated by the British player Rhodes by a score of 3-0 in the second week of the competition, while Sato Hyotaro fought bravely alone and passed several rounds in a row. On the 29th of this month, Rhodes and Sato Hyotaro met in the final. Rhodes was a British Davis Cup player, while Sato was the captain of the Japanese Davis Cup team. The two were very skilled. After four sets of fierce fighting, Sato Hyotaro won by a score of 3-1 and won the singles title. During the match, Rhodes took the lead and won the first set. After that, Sato won three sets in a row with a determined effort. The last set was a decisive moment for both sides, and the performance was particularly amazing. The French tennis king visited the stadium that day and said that Japan would not be difficult to become the future leader of world tennis. The singles results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sato Hyotaro (Japan) 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 8-6 Rhodes (England)</p>
<p>In the doubles, the teams that won the final were the French and Japanese teams. The French team was Nishimura and Hejier, and the Japanese team was the two Satos. During the final, the Japanese players won easily, with a result of 3-0. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Sato Hyotaro, Sato Tsuyoshi (Japan) 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 Nishimura, Hejier (France) This competition was the first time that Japan attended this year's Davis Cup, and it was a rare achievement to win both the singles and doubles titles in France, which shocked Europe and the United States. I recall that in 1928, our country's Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai returned home to participate in the Eighth Far Eastern Games and won both the singles and doubles titles. At that time, our country's strength was comparable to that of Japan. In the past three years, Japan has vigorously promoted tennis, and outstanding players have emerged frequently. They also attend the Davis Cup every year and have now become a strong enemy of Europe and the United States. On the contrary, in our country, players are sitting back and falling behind due to economic reasons. Is this not a pity?</p>

<p>North China Team Arrived in Shanghai Last Night… A Group of Thirteen People</p>
<p>Meeting of All Teams This Year… Tournament May Open Tomorrow</p>
<p>—Sichuan-England Team Represents Southwest—Eligibility to Be Decided Today—</p>
<h3 id="e161">This Year's District Representatives Held a Meeting <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Central China, North China, and East China teams have joined this year's National Regional Football Tournament. The Central China team arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, and the North China team arrived in Shanghai by night train last night. The tournament schedule has not yet been officially arranged and will be finalized after the representatives' meeting this afternoon. The first match is likely to begin tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Southwest Representative's Eligibility to Be Discussed <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, telegraphed the China National Sports Association, stating that transportation in Sichuan is inconvenient, and there is no perfect sports organization. Therefore, it is difficult to send regional representatives, and it is proposed that the Sichuan-England Sports Association Football Team in Shanghai temporarily serve as the Southwest representative to join this regional tournament in order to encourage, etc. The Association, because it does not conform to the original intention of hosting regional tournaments, is not convenient to make an exception and approve it, and will submit it to today's representatives' meeting for discussion. If the representatives of each region can take into account the current difficulties in the region and allow it to pass, it may be a step towards promoting national sports.</p>
<h3 id="e163">North China Football Players Arrived in Shanghai Last Night <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The North China football team arrived in Shanghai by the Puning Railway at 11 o'clock last night, a group of twelve people, led by John Ma. The selected Tianjin and Liaoning players did not go south. The team is currently staying at the Jiande Savings Association in Zhabei.</p>
<p>—The Whole Team of Athletes—</p>
<p>The North China team was originally scheduled to have seventeen players selected, but only twelve have gone south so far. Except for the goalkeeper, there are no substitutes. The list is as follows: Goalkeeper: Huang Zhenxun (Peking Yenching), Zhao Yansheng (Peking Tsinghua); Defender: Zhang Guowei (Peking Tsinghua), Xian Zhongfen (Peking Tsinghua); Center Back: Ren Yuedui (Peking Yenching), Shen Chonghui (Peking Tsinghua); Forward: Huang Zhimin (Peking Yenching), Huang Yujia (Peking Tsinghua), Tan Baoxian (Peking Tsinghua), Zhang Dejiang (Changxindian Railway Station), Zhao Qichun (Peking Minguo University)</p>
<p>—Players Who Did Not Arrive—</p>
<p>Wang Changying and Tan Fuzhen, two Northeast players, could not be found before departure and have probably returned to Liaoning. He Xiancheng, a Yenching athlete, suddenly received a telegram before departure saying that a family member was seriously ill and hurried home to visit. If he comes south, he can arrive on the 7th, otherwise he will not come.</p>
<p>Bian Fengnian, Zhang Changyu, and Bai Qingguo, three Tianjin players, did not come due to various reasons. It is a pity that Sun Sijing could not come south either.</p>
<p>—North China Football Match—</p>
<p>It is a pity that the North China football match cannot be a perfect result. According to Zhao Yansheng, when the Tianjin and Peking senior football finals were held, the strengths were evenly matched, and the scores were very close, resulting in a 3-2 victory. The spectators were unusually excited. Both teams were eager to win, so disputes were very easy to arise. In fact, the referee was not particularly unfair. The Tianjin team's objection was probably to its organization. The Tianjin players' failure to participate in the regional tournament may also be the reason.</p>

<p>Shandong Provincial Government Approves Over 91,000 Yuan</p>
<p>—Sports Field to Be Completed by the 20th—</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The athletic field for the 15th North China Games, held at the Shandong Provincial Public Sports Ground, is undergoing full-scale renovations that began some time ago. With the games drawing near, and the Shandong Games being held here in advance for preliminary selections, the timeframe is even tighter. The Public Works Bureau and contractors are actively discussing methods to ensure completion within the pre-determined schedule. This morning (3rd), Director of Education He Siyuan and Director of Construction Zhang Honglie visited the site, accompanied by Zhang Yixian, Director of the Public Sports Ground, to inspect the entire field. They urged the completion of all venues as quickly as possible, without delay. The current schedule stipulates that earthwork must be completed by April 10th, athletic field construction by April 20th, and full field layout by April 30th. If the time is too short for complete completion, the western viewing stand for important guests should be repaired first to avoid disrupting its use. It is hoped that the entire project can be completed on schedule as planned. Furthermore, as the North China Preparatory Committee's date approaches, the organization and order divisions' director, Mr. Shang Shumei, attended. The North China football and basketball events will remain in Beiping. A letter was sent yesterday urging them to come to Shandong to guide everything. Mr. Yuan Xiaoli, a North China sports expert, is also reportedly coming to Jinan. The games' expenses are 16,921 yuan, and the sports field construction budget is 74,275.435 yuan. These were reviewed and reported by the Finance, Construction, and Education Bureaus a few days ago. Today (3rd), the provincial government's regular meeting passed the original proposal. The games' expenses will be drawn from the 19th year's budget's temporary line item for the North China Games and provincial school games and education reserve fund. The construction expenses will be drawn from the provincial reserve fund.</p>
<p>The Shandong Education Bureau has organized a North China preliminary selection preparatory committee to participate in the 15th North China Games. The 10th North China Games preliminary selection will be held from May 6th. The Education Bureau states that this province has held provincial secondary school games in previous years. This year's preliminary selection is for participation in the North China Games. In addition to provincial, county, and municipal officially recognized private secondary schools, amateur groups may also participate. However, the name "North China Preliminary Selection" seems too narrow, so it has been changed to the Shandong Provincial Games. Last year's spring games are considered the first, and this session is the second. Notices have already been sent to various schools. However, the games regulations will still apply to the promulgated preliminary selection regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Last Week's Gold Market Showed Rapid Advances <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The progress was very smooth. Last week, the gold market saw a significant rise, almost reaching its peak. The pace was brisk, moving forward all the way. However, daily fluctuations remained intense, ranging from more than ten to twenty taels. People were unsettled, and many parties disagreed and controlled each other. However, with the Western Spring Festival (commonly known as the Foreign Qingming Festival), the market was closed on Friday and Saturday, leaving only four trading days. At the beginning of the week, due to large accounts such as Xinheng Yuansheng selling off and the easing of exchange rates, the lowest price suddenly fell to 686 taels. Subsequently, overseas silver markets continued to decline, and Shanghai exchange rates became tense, especially with large accounts like Lu and the Guangdong syndicate covering shorts and Wu increasing longs. As a result, the situation improved significantly, briefly breaking through the 700 tael barrier. Afterwards, it leaped thousands of feet, suddenly rising to 733 taels and 8 qian on Thursday. This was a difference of 47 taels and 8 qian in these four days. The closing on that day seemed to ease, totaling 725 taels, a net increase of 30 taels and 8 qian. Large silver bars fell a total of half a penny, silver prices fell 1.375, and the British exchange rate narrowed by two levels (half a penny). Daily gold rose 5.25. The inner market of banks also tended to improve, with colleagues making up positions and shorting bars. Currently, major speculative accounts such as Yuancheng Xinheng (Luo) had previously held short positions and have now covered. Hengxing Yuan (Lu) and Wu are in long positions. The Guangdong syndicate seems flat. According to the daily gold settlement price, the result was around 60 taels, ranging from 70 to 40 taels. Spot goods were about 9 taels higher. The April public bonds (spot goods) have all been settled. There may be some changes in the gold market after opening. The general situation of these four days is recorded below. The increase was over 30 taels. From March 30 (Monday), large bars lengthened from 125 to 0625, and silver prices rose 0.25. The first order was to change the listing price, and the internal market rebounded slightly, eventually flattening out. The supply from various firms exceeded demand. The gold market opened flat at 694 taels and a half in May, then increased to 97 taels and a half, then fell to 86 taels due to selling pressure. Afterwards, buying activity emerged, breaking through 90 taels and closing at 95 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 4 qian compared to the previous Saturday, with a total difference of 11 taels and 5 qian for the whole day. The next day, large bars contracted from 3125 to 25, and silver prices were 0.5, so the first order and others were firm internally. However, the listing price remained the same. The Guangdong syndicate resisted. The gold market opened with an increase of 9 taels and 4 qian to 705 taels. Then, Yongheng Yuancheng and others sold off, reaching 98 taels. Subsequently, large accounts such as Hengxing Yuan, Senchang, Yongchang, Sheng Yong Qianchang, and Xiang bought in, soaring by over 10 taels. In the afternoon, it reached 712 taels. Hengxing Shengda and others sold off at the close, retreating to 705 taels, an increase of 9 taels and 4 qian compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 14 taels for the whole day. On Wednesday, the large bars did not change. The first order initially had no honor, then changed to a contraction of two levels, totaling one level. The internal market was also firm, and colleagues gathered. The gold market was initially weak, but rose steadily from 702 taels and 5 qian. In the afternoon, it exceeded the 720 tael barrier. The closing was 24 taels and 8 qian. On that day, Hengxing Shengda, Hengxing Yuan, and others resisted shorts, and Wu increased his longs by 19 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day. There was a total of 23 taels of change between the front and rear markets. The next day (Thursday), large bars fell another 0.25, and silver prices were 0.625. The Shanghai market was also disturbed. The first order contracted by one level, totaling 0.25. The internal situation was solid, and various firms first gathered and then sold, resulting in a total supply exceeding demand. The gold market initially opened oppositely, at 719 taels, due to sales by the Dalian syndicate and a contraction in the silver market, causing downward sentiment. Afterwards, Yuancheng Xinheng strongly covered shorts, and the first order and others tended to be firm, so the situation flew up, jumping more than ten taels, and briefly exceeding 30 taels, reaching between 734 taels. Afterwards, selling continued, and merchants sold off, causing a decline of several taels, reaching 725 taels at the close, an increase of only 2 qian compared to the previous day. The whole market had a fluctuation of 14 taels and 8 qian. The high and low prices of British, American, Indian silver markets, gold and exchange rates are listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and customs and foreign banks were all closed as usual. There were no reports on financial or foreign exchange markets. London telegraphs and Bombay were closed for the Easter holiday, so no telegrams arrived. However, New York telegraphs showed the American silver price falling continuously by 125, totaling 2 jiao 7 fen and a half. The British exchange rate against the US dollar decreased by 0625, to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 32 over 29. The US dollar against the British pound remained unchanged at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, 9375. The Japanese yen against the US dollar remained at 49 yuan 375. The British pound against the Japanese yen remained at shilling 04375. The British shilling against Shanghai remained at 1 shilling 3 pence and a half.</p>

<p>Zhabei Silk Factories Strike, Western Holiday Closures</p>
<p>During the week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market remained unable to advance. At the beginning of the week, raw silk sales in European and American markets remained sluggish. Silk telegrams did not turn around, exchange rates were tight, and silk prices continued to weaken. European firms in Shanghai increasingly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Furthermore, a labor strike broke out at Zhabei silk factories, with 41 factories temporarily caught in the strike vortex. Manufacturers, seeing that factory prices overseas were becoming smaller and losses were even greater, increasingly adopted a negative attitude. Although American sales slightly improved towards the weekend, Western holiday closures resulted in a three-day holiday for foreign firms. Only Chinese firms such as Weicheng Company took the opportunity to throw in over a hundred bales of Grade B white silk factories, priced at just over 900 taels. With the American exchange rate contracting, it is hoped that the opening of the American firms on Tuesday will cause silk prices to rise by 10 to 20 taels. During the four trading days of the week, silk dealers only traded over 300 bales in total. Currently, over 900 bales of silk have been exported. Overseas Chinese silk prices continued to decline in the first half of the week. A special list is provided below (New York prices in US dollars per pound, Lyon prices in francs per kilogram).

<p>A check of the current stock of dried scallops on the streets shows that various stalls remain very short on supply. However, due to prices rising too high, customer sales have inevitably decreased, so the market is gradually showing weakness. Yesterday, merchants hawked medium-sized high-quality goods at 235 taels, large-sized goods at 224 taels and 3 jiao, and goods at 188 taels. Crushed goods from Xinguang were at 205 taels for new color and 190 taels for old color, Qingmori at 156 taels, and Yantai goods at 150 taels. Compared to the previous day's market prices, all have fallen by about 10 taels, with few inquiries. If customer sales do not turn strong, there is a risk of further decline.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Surrealist Painting <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Yan</p>
<p>Surrealism (Sur Realisme) is the name of a new poetry movement that originated in the French poetry scene recently. This movement also affected painters with similar tendencies. Therefore, the Surrealist movement in the French art scene has also risen.</p>
<p>According to their claims, Surrealism is based on the belief in certain forms that have been forgotten, the excellent reality of association, the omnipotence of dreams, and all indifferent intellectual activity.</p>
<p>Surrealism is a worldview that recognizes the world and provides fundamental ideas. Its theory is based on the discourse of Henri Bergson and is based on Freud's psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Natural science, of course, denies the world outside the phenomena within the scope of time and space. However, this is limited to the realm of reality. In addition, in our spiritual life, there is still the creative function beyond the laws of nature. Based on material experience based on observation and experience, we arrive at the truth of things according to spiritual life or intuition - Bergson's philosophy is where the Surrealists express their sympathy.</p>
<p>Freud's exploration of the unconscious world, especially the interpretation of dreams, also gave them great stimulation. They want to extract the essence of the spirit from the dreams of unconscious spiritual function, induce the state of dreams that transcends reality and the realm of consciousness into the real world, and create a new world. That is painting, that is poetry. They do not regard this kind of association as the subordination of dreams to reality as it has always been, but treat it as an absolute phenomenon of dreams themselves.</p>
<p>Surrealists not only want to abandon the aesthetics since the Italian Renaissance, but also hold the vitality to exclude the Latin foundation of reality. They despise the laws of harmony, ignore the dogmas of classical constraints, and stand on the front line of France's avant-garde soldiers - Surrealists - seeing the spirit as if it were everyday speech. As a result, the qualifications for the existence of romantic discussions, which have been despised by the radical painters of today, and regarded as astonishingly mysterious and inner life, are re-cultivated. They love the irrational, intuitive, and simple forms of expression of art.</p>
<p>A passage from the Surrealist manifesto says, "Surrealism is not satisfied with the expression of a certain school or a certain hometown. It integrates the reasons for the division of Europe and the elements of its existence. It must absorb all the doctrines in the world. Surrealism is a major movement in modern times. It means health and easily overcomes the tendency of decline and weakness."</p>
<p>The representative painters of Surrealism are Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Andre Massno, etc.</p>
<p>Chirico is regarded as the leader of the team. He was born in Volos, Greece in 1888. Although he is an Italian, he has Sicilian blood flowing through him. He is a self-taught painter. He used to live in Munich and returned to Rome due to the war. Later, he moved to Paris where he currently lives.</p>
<p>He despised many young talented painters who gathered under the Futurists and Impressionists. Whether it was Impressionism, Fauvism, or Absolutists, he did not participate in any of them, nor did he fall into literary chants. He understood the intellectual spiritual principles of great classical art with his profound knowledge, and explored the pure tradition of past paintings. As a mystic and poet, he observed the universe with his own eyes and experienced the universe with his unique heart. He created new compositions from the traditional classical past of his motherland. Indeed, Chirico's works cleverly utilize the inherent donation of classical traditions and succeed in becoming astonishing crystallizations of fantasy. He combines light, color, and shadow to construct contrasting lines and spaces. The creation of that sculptural form gives a unique new value to ancient and modern habits.</p>
<p>Chirico observes dreams as if they were mathematics, and transforms dreams into reality with magical geometry. His recent dreams have repeatedly appeared like galloping horses.</p>
<p>He was once called a metaphysical school because of metaphysical realism. Today, he is a Surrealist, but his inherent nature does not change because of this.</p>
<p>Ernst, born in 1891 in Brühl in the Rhine region of Germany, studied at Dusseldorf and now lives in Paris. He is interested in all plastic arts. Sometimes he paints, sometimes he engages in sculpture, and sometimes he strives to compose photographic experiments.</p>
<p>In his work in 1922, there is a painting called "Group Portrait". Although it cannot be given extra praise, it is interesting to depict a group of Surrealist poets in Paris. In addition to more than a dozen poets in different forms, sculptured Chirico and Raphael are also depicted in this group.</p>
<p>He is not only endowed with the talent of a painter, but also has the excellent talent of a printmaker. In 1922, he published two print collections in Paris, "Clichés" and "Eternal Misfortune", with a preface by Eluard Paul. Recently, a collection of paintings entitled "Natural History" has been published. This collection of paintings has a preface by Dada poet Arp. It collects thirty-four true descriptions of the creative history of fantasy nature. This work is extremely impressive. There is a "Human Eye" inside, microscopically enlarging and depicting the human eye. It should be said that he discovered an artistic field that predecessors had never set foot in. His keen sense has succeeded in opening up such a new realm.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is more appropriate to say that his other works are bizarre rather than clever and surprising. However, there, it makes us marvel at how vast his dream world is.</p>
<p>Miro, a Spaniard, is a bright lyric painter. His passion is as hot as a raging fire, and his love is as sweet as honey. Therefore, Miro's imagination is like the mystery of the moonlit night, but its expression is as clear as daylight. Miro's lyrical talent and Surrealist spirit are fused together, which is enough to play an amazing piece of SurRealisme music. He likes to describe the working world in front of him, and his works include "Hotel", "Family", "Circus", etc.</p>
<p>Masson's personality is like a new sprout of a branch, tempted by the spring breeze and fluttering. Although his works do not have the truth of Ernst, they are always soft and dreamlike. His style often has a French feel, very similar to George Braque, such as "Indoor Nude", "Knife", "Fish Struggle" and other works, all with a soft viscosity.</p>
<p>In addition to Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Andre Masson, and others, the representative writers of Surrealism also include Dablskog, Yyos Tanguy, Francis Picabia, and German Walter Spios, Mensean, and American M Ray, etc.</p>
<p>During the consideration period, with the vague tendency of Surrealist sympathy, Pablo Plcasso, Goorges Braque, and Paul Klee are regarded as honorary members of Surrealism. The first two are the pioneers of Cubism, and the latter is the fierce general who remains in Expressionism. The three have firmly established their reputation in the modern art world, but it is inevitable that the changes in the background of the times will shake their inherent foundations.</p>
<p>This weak introduction is dedicated to friends who are enthusiastic about emerging art.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Tisei Pattern Exhibition <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>In China, where the atmosphere of art - especially patterns - is very thin, a pattern exhibition of the Tisei Society has recently been held in Shanghai. This is such a delightful thing.</p>
<p>The Tisei Pattern Society is organized by the students of the Pattern Department of the West Lake Art College. They not only put in hard work on skills, but also try to explore new ways of patterns in this wilderness of China, and make a lot of research on pattern theory.</p>
<p>Oriental (Chinese) patterns have had a glorious history in the world art scene, but now they have declined. In modern times, Western mechanical civilization has also rushed to the East like a spring tide. Therefore, domestic goods are rejected because of their crudeness and clumsiness. Although this reason is due to the backwardness of the Chinese economy, the lack of beautiful patterns to organize complete goods and compete with foreign goods is also a fact. So, if we want to improve the international economic status and beautify the lives of the masses, we must incidentally promote patterns to develop mechanical industries. It must be that the gentlemen of the Tisei Society are willing to organize the pattern society and hold exhibitions with painstaking efforts, and they must have resolutely added this important mission to their own shoulders, and hope to attract the attention of the masses in the country to patterns.</p>
<p>Again, as mentioned above, patterns are an art that develops more and more with material civilization, so it becomes more and more a utilitarian and practical thing with the evolution of cities. The items in this Tisei exhibition are all designs for practical objects, and in the expression of lines and colors in their works, it can be seen that they are well-trained, and they have found a new direction for Chinese patterns in many ways.</p>
<p>Naturally, in China, where all art is backward, remote patterns are even more difficult to be recognized. However, this kind of applied art is always developing with the evolution of society, so I hope that the domestic pattern artists, especially the gentlemen of the Tisei Pattern Society, will continue to work hard to complete this cause.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely recommend that the public visit this pattern exhibition, because it is indeed a valuable gain in the barren pattern world of China.</p>
<p>Note: The Tisei Pattern Exhibition will be held at the National Goods Market on Nanjing Road for four days from the 3rd to the 6th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Poet's Moving <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Zhi</p>
<p>Moving house is originally a very ordinary thing, and there is no need to record it. However, a poet's moving is very different from the so-called moving of ordinary people, as if it contains a kind of fun worth savoring. It is beautified, artistic, and can even be said to be full of poetic flavor. What I want to describe here is not my own moving, but me, a person who is not good at doing things, helping the poet × who is shaking the literary world to move house. Because I have always been an "outsider" to these things, I have been living alone in a small corner of a red building in Jiangwan for more than three years. My friends who lived with me have moved to other places from this red building one after another. Only I, the red building, have a reluctant feeling. On the other hand, moving also requires economics. Because I owe the landlord too much rent, because of this kind of restriction that outsiders cannot know, I have deeply thrown the matter of "moving" behind me. In fact, it can also be said that I am lazy by nature. A so-called lazy person is naturally not very fond of moving, so I think moving is a job that diligent people like to do.</p>
<p>A friend once jokingly asked me, "Mo, how long are you going to live in this old nest? I see you have never moved once, which is quite interesting."</p>
<p>I always answer them in my usual way, "Probably until I graduate from here, but I think the past four years are very easy to pass."</p>
<p>My friends are still skeptical, saying, "Not necessarily. You will graduate next summer, won't you have to move? I think you might continue to live here..."</p>
<p>"That won't happen," I interrupted, "So-called university graduation, although useless, but the maintenance of life is always very important. I am a poor young man. Not only do I have to find a relatively stable place to eat, but also take care of my family. The burden of my life is so heavy, of course I can't sit in this old nest and not seek new development. Really talking about moving house will cause sadness for the bleak future, so my cowardly heart hopes to never move..."</p>
<p>I often talk about these things with my friends. This time, the poet Yi, whom I respect, actually came to me for moving. Although I am not good at this, but because of the relationship of friendship, it is also my duty to do so. So, I happily agreed to him.</p>
<p>The poet's love for artistry is an extremely obvious fact. The poet Yi, whom I respect, of course cannot escape this example. On the noon of the day he moved, I ran to his place happily alone - a small building in Tiantong'an. I saw him sitting there smiling as usual, and he was humming Su Li Su Lu in his mouth as usual, probably reciting poetry. When he saw me coming, he stood up full of joy and shook hands with me. I also broke into a smile on my sad face.</p>
<p>"Why are things still so scattered? Are you moving today?" I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"The move is so-so," he said, followed by a burst of his usual poetic laughter.</p>
<p>"Great poet...artistic..." I praised him like this.</p>
<p>"Hee...hee...hee..." He then evoked the poet's smile.</p>
<p>I am as thin as firewood, and I really don't have the strength to do heavier things. This time, I only have to make an exception, and the two of us lay the bedding and tidy up the scattered items. As a result, it is still not very neat, and we are in a hurry and don't know what to do. But looking at these items that we consider to be tidied up, we finally feel that they are full of mysterious poetry. He himself only thought that besides deeply hiding the poetry manuscripts, which are more precious than his life, in his leather suitcase, almost all the other items are not so-called precious items in his eyes.</p>
<p>Really, only the poems that the poet hums are precious.</p>
<p>So, we ate the so-called "Yangchun noodles" that ordinary people eat in Shanghai in a very economical way. Because we did some work, we forgot that we were hungry. But after we finished eating this bowl of noodles, we still couldn't understand whether this life was "proletarian" or "poetic."</p>
<p>The moving truck came and carried us and all the poet's belongings to a certain road in the French Concession, which is where his new residence is located. His co-residents, such as Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang, are all famous people in the literary world today, and the place here is very quiet. If you create literary works, especially poetry, it is really the most suitable. I sincerely said, "Poet Yi, you should contribute more great poems to the Chinese literary world in the future!" He just smiled, and a poetic smile appeared on his round face.</p>
<p>After casually making his bed, we bid farewell to Mr. Li's virtuous wife and Mr. Zhang, who was busy editing the evening newspaper that had to be published that day, and wandered on the quiet road. I then realized that moving is originally such a thing.</p>
<p>At this time, it was already more than three o'clock, and we all felt a little hungry. He said that I was too tired today for his moving, and invited me to a small restaurant on North Sichuan Road, where several of us wandering loners often come to have a snack, so that we can talk about many things we want to say. In order to avoid rejecting the poet's kindness, I had to sincerely and happily bother him again.</p>
<p>We were very disappointed that we had not met Mr. Bao, who is respected by young people, otherwise our conversation would be more vigorous. However, on this day, the two of us talked until more than seven o'clock before leaving this memorable teahouse. After drinking, we were again intoxicated in the mysterious night on North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>At this time, in addition to peeping at the displays in various stores, we never have the courage to appreciate the women on the road. Although poets are sometimes intoxicated in the net of love, we are all loners. Talking about love will cause infinite sadness, especially for people like me who wander the sea and have no relatives. Looking at my haggard face, I don't look like someone who hopes to pursue love. I should still work hard on my current career to seek the development of the country and nation, as well as my entire self. Thinking of this, the idea of love that young people urgently need is also dispelled invisibly. A certain poet is certainly much happier than me. His exquisite and lovely fiancée is studying in Suzhou, and the letters back and forth are express delivery, which is very worthy of being proud in front of me, a lonely wanderer.</p>
<p>After wandering for a long time, I felt a little lost, so I shook hands with the poet and said goodbye and returned to Jiangwan. It was already more than nine o'clock, but because my mind was confused, there are still a lot of so-called poetic things that have not been described to the fullest. Sometimes, the poet's nature is really too perverted, and it also makes us unable to tell why. I only feel that "poets are great."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Jiaotong University Organizes International Friendship Association <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>In view of the current backwardness of science and technology and the sluggishness of industry in our country, Jiaotong University believes that it is not enough to make up for our shortcomings without adopting the strengths of others. Therefore, the relationship between our country and various advanced countries must be very harmonious, so as to peep into their secrets. The school has the mission of building a new China. Engineering and construction talents should especially learn from Europe and the United States. Therefore, the school must hold meetings to welcome and host banquets to establish friendship when European and American commercial and industrial inspection groups come to Shanghai. Recently, the school has also decided to organize an International Friendship Association through the school affairs meeting. Its tasks include (1) liaison matters concerning Chinese and foreign industry, commerce, and education, (2) visits and introductions concerning Chinese and foreign industry and commerce, (3) communication of Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial academic studies, (4) exchange of professors and publications, (5) hosting foreign scholars and industrial and commercial experts. The organization plans to handle it jointly with domestic groups, and the president of the school will hire professors from the school or leaders of domestic groups as members. The number of members is tentatively set at twenty-one, and they have not yet been hired. After the association is established, its first task is to exchange professors with Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom in the near future (this matter was mentioned by the president of the school, Li Zhaohuan, when he hosted a banquet for the British Economic Inspection Group at the Dahua Hotel. The inspection group immediately agreed to return home and discuss it with the government. This matter can probably be done soon). The committee also plans to send one member to be stationed in London for a long time to manage all foreign liaison matters, because London is centrally located and has extremely convenient transportation to various advanced countries in Europe and the United States. This member will be rotated among the members once a year, and at the same time, the member can also intern and study abroad. After returning to China, they will gain new knowledge, which can benefit a lot when teaching professors and students. It is really a win-win situation. (Quan)</p>
