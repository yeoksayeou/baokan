<h3>英外相之未來戰禍警告</h3>
<p>英外相漢德森氏在軍縮會演說。一方謂今日軍縮之重要。一方謂軍縮如不能成功則未來之戰禍决非以前之比有大可駭人聽聞者</p>
<p>其言有曰如人民不欲收軍縮之效。則將來戰事之慘逈非以前戰爭可比。軍事專家曾有言曰。上次戰事零星殺人耳。將來戰事則大批屠殺矣。其言蓋謂所用之戰具决非以前槍砲之類。其效力必至多數之人。能同時喪失生命也。其言又曰。我人皆知欲於戰爭之中。而行人道主義决非我人力量所可及。一旦戰事發作。無人能控制殺機而阻止此野蠻行爲可知戰爭時所謂禁品者。皆外表之詞耳。其舉動苟有勝之可求者。將無所不爲。也</p>
<p>其言又曰欲阻止此野蠻行爲其唯一方法。在停止戰事之本身。苟戰事不能停止。一旦而發。則生命摧殘之衆。有非我人懸擬所可及者。破壞不已。我人所有之文明。亦將從此滅亡矣。其言蓋謂非盡力成就軍縮别無方法可以阻止此戰爭之大禍也</p>

<p>▲我來表丑功</p>
<p>眞茹足球隊比賽五場第一場與撈撒大學、爲三對三第二場與仙迷撈大學爲三對二、第三場與仙道頓馬示大學、爲四對一第四場與萬國聯合隊、爲三對一第五與全菲明星隊、爲二對一（雖未完場而觀衆閙事、然祗餘五六分鐘、亦算勝利）若論個人成績則陳鎭和共入八球戴　經共入六球陳家球入一球羅海光入一球、然得有此勝利者督賴全體球員聯絡策應、居前方者、自然職在衝鋒破陣、居後方者自然職在掃清入境敵軍、論萬國隊及明星隊、其實力實在不可侮、敗在人人爭欲建功、顯顯自已身手、故卒以無功也、</p>
<p>▲僑衆大擁護</p>

<p>▲入塲券收入</p>
<p>在慈善會用意、此番門劵收入注重在華僑方面、祖國球隊愈戰勝、則華僑參觀愈踴躍、在第一場收入祗二千餘元比賽結局又打對和、聞總幹事劉清高憂形於面、謂客方萬一再打敗仗入必大受影響、或目不敷開消、現則大有可觀矣、據英佈告籃球五場收入六千餘元、足場上四場、收入二萬一千餘元）最終一塲尚未佈告）總計必在三萬元以上、而此行運動員旅費·膳宿·費會塲佈置　·廣告宣傳費等等開消、亦不過一萬五千餘元、此等籌欵方法、可謂不必沿門托缽、人人自踴躍輸將尚有日本拳術家鬭拳、門劵收入、因未注意及之故未詳）</p>
<p>▲英美人預言</p>
<p>在比賽第一二場終後、有運動常識之英美人、即謂曁大隊决勝、其理由謂有聯絡合作精神、始終陣勢不亂而每次發球、皆有呼應、故有賭勝負者、皆以曁大球隊佔上風（即佔曁大方面者顯以多數傳人少數）</p>
<p>▲聯絡感情歟</p>
<p>一九二五年　在馬尼拉舉行遠東運動會、中菲足球隊曾　過一次風潮一九二七年樂華足球隊與仙迷撈亦發生風波（彼球員戰敗　起打我球員彼自說不去輿論大加攻擊）此回記者方幸有完滿結果不謂在最後大鐘間亦難避免不幸事實雖無傷整個球隊榮譽然亦於中菲運動史中留一裂痕、請觀下列趣事、便知風潮爲不可免矣</p>
<p>▲食粥與飮水</p>
<p>在羣衆雜觀中使各拍掌喝采爲正當助威、固甚宜也但每次敵方勝則菲衆必高呼「食粥」蓋華僑習慣早晚兩餐食粥、譏我食粥無力也、若遇我方勝、則羣衆中高呼「飮水」以報之、菲人以水代茶譏其飮水足軟也似此互相譏笑一言不合、在在可發生打架故謂國際運動增加運動興趣提高運動標準表現各國民族精神則可若謂增進兩國民族間感情則在中菲間實在適得其反</p>
<p>▲愧對我嘉賓</p>
<p>此回運動非居留地華僑球隊與彼隨意周旋、乃特意請我全國最高學府錦標隊、跋涉千里爲彼慈善會張場面乃彼觀衆竟敢辱我在塲職員自無怪橋衆難堪警察又欲拘我運動員、更屬無理之至幸慈善會同人奔走疏通市裁判亦不欲深究其事警署所欲起訴之不釋放二華人、亦經撤消控案願從兹雲過天清前事俱忘、</p>
<p>▲倖哉諸健兒</p>
<p>此在三星期中街談巷議莫不以球場戰勝爲談助、比之祖國駛來數萬噸戰艦寄　在岷海灣者更爲眉飛色舞而戴麟經陳鎭和明太祖長脚仙等等威名比之偉人及富豪過境更留僑界以深刻印象可永久而不廢滅吾願未來諸健兒其速起、戰艇飛艇非短促時間可以辦到現急欲爲祖國增高國際榮譽者惟在此運動場中好身手之健兒、</p>
<p>▲特别加尊崇</p>
<p>此回勝利、賴緒球員個個努力吾屢言之矣、惟有數人應更加以尊崇者戴麟經身總師干調度得宜、指揮如意常山百勝將軍趙子龍後身也陳鎭和身先士卒、勇於衝鋒一舉足令敵心驚胆戰長髯公介弟鐵面將軍張翼德也莊善鴻固守中樞策應有方、且身體雄偉、有如護法韋䭾馮運佑·江善敬·銅脚鐵頭、防守内衛有若鐵門神神荼鬱壘在座羣鬼不敢窺門其餘徽號可以仍舊</p>
<p>▲五載與十年</p>
<p>有熟悉中菲情形、并對體育素有研究者某君語予菲方運動員過半家境貧窮且皮膚作紅棕色純爲馬來由族、面貌不揚如籃球健將Jacinto有若影戲片火燒紅蓮寺之孫癩子此等運動員可保在十年中長期鍛鍊體魄而無外界相誘惑、若我方運動員則個個氣宇軒昂、現各大學男女交際公開、許多皇后宮主校花多願與在運動塲中萬衆歡迎之健兒、表示親近故在陳掌諤征菲日記中寫出春江送别許多情人眼涙、爲點綴行程、則將來美人情長自然英雄足短、某君所言確否合理不必論惟吾願諸健兒長保此金剛不壞身爲祖國作干城、勿如皮球一入城網終滾不出也、</p>
<p>▲全隊留十日</p>
<p>再有一事奉告閱者諸君、諸運重員本擬本日回國、乃打架案經已取消嘉年華會又於今晚開幕、慈善會再懇作十日留行將有數場足籃球友誼的比賽將再伸喜秃筆、　將來情形、佈告於諸君之前也、</p>

<h3>記吾國版籍之淪亡　清癯</h3>
<p>吾國版籍之興。自刋石始。次即爲鏤版。至活版（創自宋布衣畢昇）爲最後。然由篆變隸由簡變素。由素變紙。以及摹印。書日多。而讀者益輕視之。此亦時爲之也。葉夢得謂「今天下印書。以杭州爲上。蜀本次之。福建最下。可知宋代版籍之一斑。</p>
<p>然遠者不論。而寳藏秘笈。必以宋槧爲貴。乃至明永樂間。文淵閣所存。厪雕本十之三。鈔本十之七。則所謂鏤版者。亦止此耳。迨萬歷間下詔校理遺籍。僅存地志而經典已散佚無幾。是以有宋一代之刋刻。尤爲世所珍。今歲中國科學社於一月一日在明復圖書館開書版展覽會中貯北宋刻經隋唐人寫經。多至數十種。見者詫爲未有。而該會之闡揚國粹。掇拾叢殘。厥功尤偉。</p>
<p>因思及日前日本有古文孝經及古文尚書等之影印。尤爲吾國最古之版籍。不知何時流落於彼土。又美國議院藏書樓。貯有吾國之華籍。計一千七百餘種。約二萬本。中以叢書及私人著作居大多數。此猶近時輸出者。如以前共計之。不下十二萬五千餘册亦足以驚人已。聞者或不信。然一觀世界新聞社之通訊。與國民新聞社之消息固已載之鑿鑿而非託之子虚</p>
<h3>紅泥飛灑巴黎城　履冰</h3>
<p>疾風急雨之候。天際濃雲。每挾異物而俱來。凌空下墮。頓成奇觀。按諸典籍記載有雨魚雨蟲雨蛙等事。理或有然。諒非虚造。考厥原因。實由池沼溝渠之所含、被颶風捲入空中。包羅雲裏。隨勢流行。往往逾數百里外。始夾雨點而同墮。見者訝然。實無足怪也。</p>
<p>新近巴黎空際。竟有天雨紅泥之事。是日濃雲陣陣。烏黑異常。忽然雲散雨來。則點點下降。均爲赤色之漿泥。一時路人車輛房屋。盡遭灑及。恍如大隊漆工將巴黎全城。加以煊染有幾處街道。所積紅泥。約及半英寸之高。尤爲前此所未見。</p>
<p>據談此次巴黎所降之紅泥。均來自一千五百里外之薩哈拉沙漠。在斐州北部。吹入空中。向北飄行。渡越地中海。直至巴黎。始紛紛落地。致造成此種怪現象云。</p>
<p>者。不特唯是。聊城楊氏海源閣之藏書。近亦散亡無餘。宋版之柳柳州集孟浩然集孟東野集。在津被日人以八萬金貨之以去。其他可想。此爲晚清道咸以後。南北四大藏書家之一。而其子孫猶不保其故物。雖曰兵燹劫灰之餘。而亦負有地方文化之責者。不能辭其咎。</p>
<p>昔聞永樂大典被焚。靡不爲之歎息。詎今英倫圖書館猶存八十餘册。其何以落於西人士之手。皆不能無疑。以今證之。吾國古時版籍之淪亡。不僅土苴視之。而一任其化爲游塵野馬而已。甚至盜竊而亦聽之遂使發揚國光。潤飾鴻業之所寄者。至數十年後。乞諸彼國。以拾其吐餘而反哺其母。甯匪可悲可哀之甚。故余特揭之。以告國之學人。</p>
<h3>記上海一預言家覺迷</h3>
<p>▲今日上海縣之遷治</p>
<p>▲二十年前已有預言　　昔年上海城隍廟西房住持朱粹芳者。出家道土也。原籍寶山。故其道號曰玉峯道人。道人精於術數。凡道未來之事。事後無不中者。當袁海觀爲上海邑令時。歲值大旱。斷屠不雨。祈神不雨。叩之道人。道人謂某日某時當雨。至日天仍放晴。疑又不騐及交某時。油然作雲。沛然下雨。不爽毫釐給以精參易理匾額。後袁去任。道人謂人。袁公必將重蒞。其後數年。袁任蘇松太道。果重蒞滬上。道人平日茹素。不食葷腥。冠道巾。衣道袍道貌岸然。而爲人瀟灑。邑中士人。多與往還。作方外交。而與前輩朱紫君先生。尤相莫逆。二人時入茶坊品茗。或入酒肆買醉。前清未禁烟時滬上烟館林立。每入烟館。一榻横陳。蓋道人雖爲方外之人。而了不拘拘於禮法也。道人於出門時。每有一種暗示示人。蓋其日而天無纖雲。初無雨意道人如携雨具、則於途中必遭傾盆大雨。其日而天山陰雨。了無晴意。道人不携一傘者。出門之後。雨必隨之而止。有時出門之前先言數事。則於出門之後。必如所言。如曰。今日出門。小有不利。須遭小人暗算者則是日在外。必有失竊財物之事。今日出門。當有所遇。其遇出於不意者則是日在外。必有遭遇意外之事有時中途遇見一事。言其將來。日後騐之。歷歷不爽。一日。與紫君先生小步街頭。見有某姓大興土木。起造祠宇。道人視之。歎息曰。今此祠宇。雖在經始。恐其落成之日。即其拆卸之時。當日紫君先生聞之殊不之信。然而他日過之則以某姓祠宇有礙道路令之遷讓。已在拆卸。一日道人於烟館中。方與數人吞雲吐霧。館對上海城堞。忽指城堞言曰。言之殊奇上海城堞。不久將拆。而尤奇</p>
<h3>易君實甫墓志銘（中）甯鄉程頌萬</h3>
<p>又陳管見十事。請赴前敵。在軍素食。哭泣無時。乙未四月。和議割台灣畀倭。君復詣闕上言。請罷和議。　權　。籌戰事。不報。乃乞忠誠予檄赴台偵探。因　劉永福。畀以四營守台中。台餉　。君復　海歸謁江督張文襄公。乞欵五萬還台。致永福。出次厦門。策台北士民獨立。而永福忽内渡。劉張二公。懼君違旨挑　累已。延君父至卾。堅命促歸。君之乞餉。乘筏出鹿耳門。颺浪壓空。　天踴嶽。高下百變。颷掣霆吼。萬死垂睫。自念國難未　。殉母亦所安也。遂冥坐誦佛號。浪不及衣。三睨而達輪舟。蓋若有神陰相云。其年冬。服関。劉忠誠奏稱君性情忠篤。學識閎通。請破格録用。奉旨召對二次。皇太后詢江南近狀。奏稱劉坤一大事不糊塗。朝廷緩急安危。終以老成爲可恃。又稱皇太后春秋漸高。皇上聖學無人輔導。聖躬無人保護。皇上爲天下主。上安則天下安。上强則中國强。顧請以張之洞爲師傅。皇太后頷之。交軍機處存記。庚子督辦江陰江防。旋赴行在。督江楚轉運。改駐陜。壬寅冬簡任廣西右江道。調署太平思順道。駐　州。時邊帥易人。於巡道權限防餉。多所齮齕。因陳督撫飭所　修　民堡。量裁緑營。暫緩賭禁。以殺匪勢。復相詆詰。一不屈。龍州關稅素絀。及君累贏月　。給邊防砲台經費。前所未有也。表列所屬户口。荒振刦殺諸案。督領規畫。剿治撫循。甫及一月。邊氓漸安。而總督岑春煊。遽以名士畫餅劾罷之。還潯。丁父憂。苫塊積苦風濕。病絶復甦。奉父櫬歸葬漢壽。服関。明年詣都察院。自呈被參寃抑。奉旨飭粤督查覆。得　。　復原官。戊申歲盡。授雲南臨安開廣道。旋調廣東欽廉道。及秋署。廣旋羅道。移高雷陽道。所在吏民稱願。辛亥秋調省。蒞香港。廣州變作。遁居滬上。貧不自聊。歲餘赴京師。食於印局參事。積感　弛。顚倒歌哭。不知有生。凡所造　裒。憂割名以自贛其氣。其視當世人物。貴義貧富。愚智强弱新故。不爲畦町。而接倡優。則如飮食不可廢。者。上海縣治又必遷治其時蓋在光緒季年。聞者以爲支離怪誕。决無其事。都不之信。及光復。果城堞拆去。至此而道人拆城之言騐矣。然於道人上海縣治遷治之言。猶以爲决無其事及改上海縣治爲市後。昔之聞道人言者。以上海旣劃分爲市縣。又料上海縣治必如道人所言。而有遷之一日洎夫今日。遷治已在進行。至此而道人遷治之言。果又騐矣。道人物化業已多年。當其言時。距今蓋已二十餘年云</p>
<h3>烹飪小言醉痴生</h3>
<p>飮食之道首貴清潔新鮮。再加以烹調得法配製合宜。自然適口充腸津津有味。雖易牙復生。當亦不外乎是理。今海上各帮餐館林立。未嘗不以招致名廚講究烹調爲號召。然欲求其盡善盡美。富有眞味者實不數數觀。往往盛饌雜陳。花樣翻新。而一究其實。輒令人摇首縐眉有「價美物廉」之　。此無他。胥由太講形式。與烹調之不合法耳故推求其弊總不外下列三端。試分述於下。或可爲改良之一助歟</p>
<p>（一）太重用調味品如「味之素之類。太嫌重用。幾於無物不加嘗見庖人製饌時。一手執瓶。任意揮灑。遂致眞味被掩。起一種特殊之鮮味。且此物過用。食之令人身體上感應不快如口舌燥渴。大便多行而糖泄業經多數人證明。按此種調味品本宜少用。故每瓶附有形如挖耳之小匙今大用特用已失創製者之本意</p>
<p>（二）欠新鮮無論何項物品。均置冰箱中。縱能歷久不壞。雖非魚餒肉敗。而肉質呆滯本味漸失。徒重用調味品又有何濟。若魚類更不宜藏置過久至有貪進本價廉用所謂冷氣間貨者。則更卑卑不足道矣。</p>
<p>（三）過油膩凡湯炒及清墩紅燒之類。大抵加芡粉兼之油汁四溢。旣油而膩。食之易生厭惡且令人消化不良。</p>
<p>以上三端。係犖犖大者特表而出之。經營其事者宜加以改革糾正庶口福與衛生。兩有裨益。饕　如不佞。竊有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>歐游通信（九十八）　　劉海粟</h3>
<p>▲巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三羅馬十日（二十一）</p>
<p>我們盤桓於庭院。大廳和禱壇之間。看見許多兀立着的。偃臥着的。盤踞着的。或欹伏於壁間。或凌空而仰視有鬚髮蒼然的老人。有苦痛挣扎的少年。有活潑驕矜的英雄。有端靜美麗的女神等無數的幾千百年遺留下來的石像。這都是希臘及羅馬之有名的雕像那些雕像之中。豐滿的胸膛。靈活的肢腿最先動人觀感其他細部亦情態畢現。舉凡肉體上的。各種形式。各種姿勢已臻到了最生動最完善的領域了。即使今日最精密最成功的人體研究者。也恐望塵莫及。還有無數的秀雅的殘石隨處皆是都與以豐饒的美滿的生命。一個一個都有力量都欲辭座而下。它是從邃古以來人的生命所凝結於此的。不但能使梵諦岡的榮光和偉大長留人世。並且古人制作精神。亦可永垂無極努力呀。努力於生命的表現。我盡情觀賞這梵諦岡的至寳。這時我眞如神游於數千年之往昔。陶醉於南國的青天和海濱的晴光之下。覺得人類的靈魂。永遠浴在清明或悽惶的日光之中。</p>
<p>可是。有一層這裏也應該把我的實際所感到的老老實實地寫出來。在這無數古代寳藏的梵諦岡裏面同時還陳着許多近代的繪畫和彫刻。二者相形之下。就大大的不同了。置身於二者　間。觀感頓異尤其後者。能使我們感覺遲鋪。精神委靡那些雕刻最多的就是一些模仿希臘或者羅馬名作的外形只有造作的肌肉。過事誇張的姿態。僵了的手足。給我們觀看。所謂藝術家的個性。想像。全都消失的了。這是令我深致惋惜的。表面上似乎勇健誇張現出虎視欲撲的神氣。但不曾與我以絲毫慰藉。不但如此而其造作之處並欲令人作十日嘔。</p>
<p>昔日壯健的裸體豪俠的比武競技運動的活模型已不見於今日。其流風餘韻。他們不再去追求他們並也不再想吸受新的靈感了。他們只是依了希臘和羅馬那些典型去摹倣。屑屑於呆板的技巧。和一定的理論之作法而造作。所以他們只有重複模倣。誇張的作品。作品中只充滿了他們計算的手腕。絶無偉大的感靈直接流露他們不能創造只能倣造。</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市轉緊</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日裡路到源二十餘號、走銷轉旺緣少數店家路須存積、而一部份　虧之貨户、頗有上棧、備結賬後出售之意、是以市形趨活、北帮白粳與　稻一致喊起一角之譜、而特别頂粳貨少更秀、羊秈銷殷到淡、價亦上升近尺杜尖埠尖統呈平穩之局、各方買氣不暢、且鮮高貨、是以交易不多變陰元來貨續抵酒銷平庸、　飯作零銷則佳盤面因亦微堅、刻下此間聞擬定十四日起停斛故在斯兩市内交易轉旺也、</p>
<p>▲滬南　昨日内地來源不多、本街走銷不一、常錫　粳殊　高貨故特頂者頗受買户之歡迎普通中次市形悉呈定勢、蘇同白粳去路尚佳、零銷與鄉莊頗有問津行情見挺角左、南帮　稻到銷兩抵、價格高堅次穩、羊　秈市况俏俐、緣此貨存到兩薄而　江客秈又有客帮　問、故微受影響價乃漸呈緊切矣變元陰化各方貪進者價微昂胃淡者批　較足故市上有半尺之上落也</p>
<h3>客米存底十萬餘包</h3>
<p>▲江西機晚占多數</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况更爲清淡因　例送灶日買賣均須停止以待結束故後市本客均無問訊、全日未有成交、到　亦淡、即有到貨亦不出樣　以年内市面不佳、須至舊例紅盤中、主行出樣兜售、至存底較往年爲少但連　囤户與客帮辦存未裝之貨以及客帮新到之貨、總數亦有十萬以上兹將所存總數附　於下（單位千）</p>

<h3>粉市徘徊不穩</h3>
<p>昨日粉市　上下兩市開盤後、各月份市價均見盤　不定之局上午開市後因金價仍高洋麥電訊又漲六七角、一　空頭心虚急浦近遠期各漲二三分市市氣甚旺似有繼前日輟長增高之局但一經漲後、一般浮多與内地多頭、以有利可圖紛紛售出市面乃見反動本月份亦小三分、下月份立小四五分、遠期一致跟小小後又有紗花帮趁勢健進市面又爲上　但　至　期金價　小、故七月份收市小去二分、二月未有出入下月小七五四月小一分七五、五月小一分半、六月小五厘云</p>
<h3>麥市步步下鬆</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、上下兩市開盤後、近　各月份均見逐步下鬆之象、洋麥雖見報漲紗花帮則無續進、大批浮多與内地買户則以價格　足、多主在結賬前占利結束大批出　市而隨見下游矣、收市本月份小二分、下月份小二分四月份小二分、五月份小五分、六月份小二分七月份小四分現麥進出兩乏存底約有一萬多包以長江及江北兩路爲主、火車貨則占少數云、</p>
<h3>標準黄荳豆餅突跌</h3>
<p>▲今日起停市辦理結賬</p>
<p>▲黄荳　昨日豆市交易　佳、緣係賣買兩方頗有結束、因交易所今日起辦理結賬休市故客帮方面除備收現者續進外餘則了結甚多、兼之大連電報突跌金市告軟而少數人心因豆價狂漲獲利甚厚逐盤了結是以全日賣氣　肚本月期因有一部份抵空交易、市稍下落而遠期竟跌至與上週未收價相彷、前日之上漲、大有呈虚昂之趨勢此種大漲大跌之情况、實屬罕見誠亦意外之變化也收市結果計二月期小去六分三月期小去九分四月期小去一錢一分、五月期小去一錢、</p>
<p>▲荳餅　昨日餅市因原料猛跌連情欠佳、致上下午各盤浮多與新空售出不少但在前日市塲之人心觀察大有步步向上之狀態故晨初開盤尚承前日之餘風而步穩奈大連客帮與號帮忽有大批之抛賣、致市隨大勢而下瀉也、收市計三月份與六月份均小二分二厘半、四月份小去三分、五月份小去三分半、</p>
<h3>糖市　結束期近之糖市</h3>
<p>▲交易…市氣挺…勢將逐高</p>

<h3>汽車新聞　專論</h3>
<h3>無法應付之美國汽車界不景氣　程志政</h3>
<p>▲不景氣由於商業循環</p>
<p>▲三年一度今年可轉機</p>
<p>▲發施登發表救濟方策</p>
<p>▲胡佛總統亦無法防止</p>
<p>在不久以前。我（原作者自稱以下仿此）去參加本城的汽車工程師年會。本來。每次到了開年會的時候。大家總是很愉快的。即使有什麽演說。也無非說些詼諧可笑的故事。或是報告過去一年間快樂的回憶。可是今年的年會。却大謬不然。大家遇到了所談的。都是關於不景氣的話。而且開會時候。大家更默默無言。愁眉雙鎖。四週的空氣。驟然由愉快而變爲慘澹。這件事眞令人驚異了。</p>
<p>尤其有趣的。是幾位的演說。他們都認爲商業已達到極可怕的地步。並且這種不景氣。尚不知何日可了。内中有一位說得最滑稽。他說。「如果諸君是有事做的。那麽。我勸勸諸君就不要輕易脫離它。因爲你一經離了它。就立刻無事可做。換句話說。就是也要加入失業的集團。萬一你眞不幸而去職時。你也不要在都市中等機會了。趕快回到鄉下去看看牛羊。等到商業復興的時期。再行出山罷。一當時大家聽了。不禁黯然。</p>
<p>爲了參加了這次年會。我又不禁聯想到以前的事來。當一九一四年十二月時候。歐戰爆發。大家愁個不了。以爲歐洲市場全將没落。損失將不可勝計了。然而過了幾月。非但美國對歐貿易没有受影響。并且突飛猛晉。打破了空前紀録。理由是戰時各國的生産工具。都改造軍火。不能供應需要。美國却趁此獲得不少的好處。在一九二一年的時候。又釀成商業不景氣。可是過了三四個月。重又恢復原狀。如果從一八八零年算起。至一九三零年爲止。那麽。在這五十二年之中。不景氣的年份如下。一八八四丨五年。一八九三丨四年。一八九六丨七丨八年。一九零四年。一九零八年。一九二年。一九一四年。一九二一年。一九二四年。一九二七年。</p>
<p>也有時候的不景氣。是由心理作用而的。譬如一九一九年大戰終了之後。大家以爲協約國間的條約。將一律廢除。戰債也不承認了。如此一來。商業必蒙損害。於是謡言一起。客家也不敢多買。廠家也不敢多出。豈知協約國的戰債。並没有取消。反而各處爭先恐後的來定貨。這是屬於心理作用的不景氣。</p>
<p>這種時旺時衰的現象。在商業中名曰商業循環。它的性質猶如冬天和夏天一樣。是週而復始的。也可以比做潮汐。循環不已的。前一兩年。有些樂觀派的汽車商人。大唱高調。說商業循環學說。已經打破了。以後美國必可每年保持圓滿的成績。一直向前去發展。可是現在呢。不景氣終又來了。誰能解釋它不是由於商業循環律呢。</p>
<p>商業循環在汽車尤其顯著。如果我們用圖來看。那麽。時增時减。有如鐵律。我們雖說商業循環可以比諸潮汐和時節。然而有一點是根本不同的。因爲潮汐時節可以有一定的時期。可以預知的。而商業循環。却無從預知。它旣没有一定相隔的年度。又没有先後同樣的情形。大致大商業不景氣以前。有幾件事是最顯著的。股票一定要跌價。物價降底。同時利息也由高而銳跌。同樣在恢復期開始的時候。股票先漲。接着許多東西也隨着高。</p>
<p>在去年美國證券跌得甚可怕。今年銀行又倒了一千多家。這種不景氣已開端了。當去年秋季。市面不振。美國大總統胡佛即召集汽車大王福特及其他實業界領袖會商應付方策。並議定了幾個辦法。然而終無濟於事。工商業。逐漸的下沉。但到什麽時候纔可以恢復。誰也不能下一個斷語。有人說。以歷史看來。目前的不景氣。也許就要恢復了因爲自從開始到現在。已經有十六個月了。决没有不回頭的道理的。可是以專家的眼光看來這次的特環。非至一九三一年終。不能恢復。在泛論了美國不景氣以後。便要談到汽車本身來。如果依專家的預算。那麽。一九三一年的汽車事業。當然也陷在不景氣的迷漫中了。不過。汽車界的盛衰。雖不能完全脫離商業循環。然而却也略有特殊之點。汽車界的一增一减。大約是三年一度。在三年終了之後。接上來的一年。必定是事業最發展的一年。從歷史上看來。一九二一年是生産低減的。到一九二二年却造成空前紀録。如今一九二七年至一九三○年都是生産低減的。算起來是整整的三年了。一九三一年也許要有</p>
<h3>飛顯廠内大壓型機　　吉</h3>
<p>大都汽車車身之鑲板。或邊面。或後端。往往陳現凹凸不平之處形殊難看此非漆料之弊乃因鋼型時未合法也若用純眞鋼板再以精美機壓型。即無此種弊端。美國通用汽車製造總廠之飛顯車身廠。近裝可大之新式壓型樞節機一架專爲壓平刷新鋼片之用。舊式每次祗能壓型一塊今則每次雖二三塊。亦可同時爲之。而其成績較前遠勝多矣</p>
<p>如圖之壓型機。比他種尤爲準確精巧。飛顯車廠現有此項機器十四架。每架重四百噸。並有一千三百噸之壓力。每次可同時發生四種顯著之滑行動作。因此名曰四面滑動之壓型樞節機。</p>
<p>此種新式四面滑動式之壓型機。能以最短之接筍製成大塊鋼片。是以片面非但光滑平坦。且無凹凸波紋。而其全片勢力。則比其他長節之壓型機爲强。</p>
<p>大壓型機所出之鋼板。片面整潔。彎曲準確。因使飛顯廠所造之車身底質優越外觀美麗。此通用車之所以稱滿意者也</p>
<p>此機能力强大。勝任壓型最堅硬粗笨之鋼鐵。然其工作時曞减縮。費用節省。比諸舊式機器。約有十餘倍。因此通用主顧亦得經濟之利益。</p>
<h3>飛顯壓型機</h3>

<p>特殊的發展的。</p>
<p>不過。一點是值得注意的。便是現在汽車市塲。是「替代市場」而不是「新置市場」。這話怎麽講呢。目前美國甚至於歐洲。汽車事業。橤职發達。差不多四五人之中就有一輛了。所以非到舊車用壞。不買新車。謂之「替代市場」。而不是「新置市場」。替代市場的發展。終也是有限之至的。除非眞去創建「新置市場」。汽車事業。終難造成空前紀録。所以我敢說。一九三一年的汽車貿易。也許比一九三○年要好些。然而却不是最勝利的一年。總之。目前的世界不景氣。是一種天然循環。並不是什麽新奇的怪事。至於汽車事業。誠哉也受天然循環的支配。可是它的循環律和普通商業却又不同。大概是三年一度。屈指至一九三一年應當恢復。不過因爲汽車在美國已達到最高點。一九三一年的發展。還在「替代市塲」中。非我也和橡皮大王發施登君談過這件事。我問他有什麽意見。發施登氏笑着說。「我有一個法子。就是大家多造些價廉物美的汽車。」又說「廠家這幾個月眞焦急呢。現在没有其他辦法。祗有設法來改良貨</p>

<p>圖示福特汽車公司運華推銷之新式運貨車。其輪間距分一百三十一吋半及一百五十七吋兩種複式。後輪加裝與否聽便。</p>
<p>物。以及贬價出售。我相信。用新式生産方法。成本總可低减些。這也是救濟不景氣的一法呀。」</p>

<h3>各省路政瑣聞　悟非</h3>
<p>▲江蘇省　蘇省對於徵工築路。積極進行。不遺餘力。最近工作。舉其要者約有四端。（一）建設廳於省句路。先修由省會車站至慧圓庵約十餘一段。京蕪路先修由江甯安東門至鐵心橋約十餘里一段。一面仍嚴令各縣繼續進行徵工築路。限期完成省縣合道。（二）嘉定境内應築之鎭滬省道。共長四十五里。建廳限十九年底完成。（三）奉賢縣建設局以閔南路爲該縣交通要道。現全國道路協會籌築自閔行至平湖汽車路。在事實上亦有聯絡之必要。已呈准建廳尅日開辦。其經費即以徵存之路道畝捐内移用。現已招標。限三個月完成。（四）鎭江自辛豐至黄墟一帶。交通極關重要。建局擬即修築新路。其測量工作。早已完竣。不日開始興工云。</p>
<p>▲浙江省　浙江路政。最近計劃者有二事。（一）公路局對於原定嚴徽公路計劃。經派工程師組測勘隊。業已測竣。該局已决定自嚴州起經過富陽。新登·分水·凉安等縣路。長三百餘里。預算興築。於本月開始動工。明年夏間通車。（二）杭州電氣局計劃敷設有軌電車案。經建設會議議决。其辦理手續。仍由該局負責。聞是項鋪送碎石購製鋼軌電車等項。預算約需二百二十萬元。已在設法籌集中矣。</p>
<p>▲安徽省　皖建設廳所辦之京蕪汽車路。自蕪當段通車以來。商旅頗稱順利。惟蕪當交界之大橋鎭。因有河道阻隔。以致車抵該站。必須過河換車。極感不便。特擬具便橋計劃書。呈建廳核准。已於上月一日開始動工。晝夜趕造。業經告竣。從此蕪湖開行之長途汽車。一小時内即可直達當塗矣。</p>
<p>▲廣東省　粤省之廣汕公路。分段興築。全路現將竣工。其第一幹綫省送中之樟惠段、平惠段、海陸段、陸普段、普揭段、揭安段、博響段、共有汽車數十輛。現已通車。其東路第一幹綫之普甯至汕頭一段。與潮安至黄崗一段。亦均通車。其東路第二幹線中。未築者博羅至河源一段。有四十里。河源至龍川一段。沿河二十里及河南岸四十里。均可通車。惟龍川至老隆、歧嶺至蘭關、大埔至峯市。已經測定。現正次第興工云。</p>
<p>▲湖北省　卾省建廳對於各公路。亦甚積極。（一）漢宜線於上年底築至沙洋。（二）卾東綫築至麻城。（三）卾北綫培修橋樑。並添購長途汽罡一十八輛。計需經費十六萬元。（四）沿江馬路。現在僅能修築漢陽門段。全部完成。計須經費二十餘萬元。俟財廳將建設費撥到。即分期完成。</p>
<p>▲四川省　川省擬築由重慶至黔省之黔渝馬路。已商得黔省府同意。全路共長四百餘里。每里約需洋五千元。共需洋二百萬元。依照徵工辦理興築。現已派工程師前往測量。限三月内測量完畢。第四月後即可動工。預計兩年。可以完成。即可直通黔桂二省矣。</p>
<p>▲新疆省　新省僻處西北。戈壁遼闊道路崎嶇。允宜從交通着手。故將原有官大道。略加修葺。作爲汽車路。顧路政不良。車多毁損。現由省府委派專員。聘覓工師先行測勘。由迪化至古城之汽車道路。路長四百七十三里。共計約需省票銀一千餘兩之譜。一面分别派員督工。一面於駐迪古一帶。各團營撥派工兵三千名。劃分四路。先行開工興修。再次第由興修古城。至哈密至猩猩峽各路綫云。</p>
<p>▲吉林省　吉省向有吉海·吉長·吉　·三條路通車。汽車甚少。最近建廟擬建築公路。招員派往各縣調查。測繪施工。俾嗣後可以開掘礦物。發展實業而利四季之交通也。</p>
<p>以上各省。舉其所知者言之。其他諸省。俟有所得。再行續贅。</p>

<h3>勦匪　客慈</h3>
<p>那日早上、還只有四點鐘的時候、阿大被一陣鎖聲閙醒了、他想「又來了、」　　的確、近來夜間常有老鼠到他們房間裏來閙、不但是吵得不好睡覺、而且拿阿大的新買來的書的背皮咬破了一大塊、這是最使阿大憎惡的、</p>
<p>眞是没有辦法、阿大曾經買了一個捕鼠機來、想以此减少幾隻老鼠、可是巧得很、這些老鼠遍不去吃、所以也没有施展的餘地、阿大只好把老鼠洞補起來、想借此防止老鼠出來、但是老鼠的神通眞是廣大、不到多時、他馬上又重新開了一洞出來、阿大想或許找一隻貓來、老鼠總不會再出來了吧、貓不久就找了來、又是不行、往往連夜間喂貓的飯、都被老鼠吃光了、阿大没有辦法、只好呆看着鼠洞、咬着牙根在想、</p>
<p>「又來了、」阿大給老鼠咬東西的聲音吵醒後、自已對自已這樣的說、「我要給點顔色給你看看、於是他不做聲的起來塞好了老鼠洞、關上門、於是丨</p>

<p>他們唯一的武器、是鐵鈎、和鐵　老鼠被他們從書架中趕了出來、急的滿房亂跑、害得阿大阿二無法去打牠、最後「我們把箱子堆成一個角、把老趕鼠到裏面去就好打呆的了、」阿大想了一個辦法、提議這樣做、通過後、他們就把箱子堆起來與牆壁砌成了一個角、</p>
<p>「你在這裏等着、老鼠來了、你就打、」阿大吩咐阿二、、自已就到滿房趕、老鼠居然被趕到角隅裏去了、阿二打、打不着、老鼠跑到璧上去了、阿上看準了跑過去就是一下、碰的一下、這當然是拿穩的、只要一下、就可把老鼠打下來、可是、不、僅不過現牆壁上打了一個缺口、再是一下、又没打中、這時他已是笑得閉不上口、他想、在居然像在勦匪一樣的與老鼠開仗了、老鼠也在這時候不知躱到甚麽地方去了、</p>
<p>尋、四處的尋、床上床下、桌上桌下、書架裏牆角裏都尋過了、而獨没有看見這「逃匪」老鼠、</p>
<p>「或許從那個洞裏溜走了吧、」</p>
<p>「没有、這房裏的洞都塞起來了、」</p>
<p>「那麽到甚麽地方去了呢、」</p>
<p>「再尋、總走不出這房子就是了、」</p>
<p>阿大拿了手電筒、四處照、依舊没有最後丨</p>
<p>「呀、在這裏、」當他照到書架後面的時候、在一　雜誌中、也發見了一個老鼠在躱着、不客氣的就是一棒丨這時他已換得了一根棒丨打中了、眞的打着了、可是爲了書的遮避、老鼠没有受傷、反衝了出來、給阿大嚇了一跳、</p>
<p>「呵、有兩個、有兩個、」</p>
<p>「眞是怪、没有就連一個都没有、有起來到有兩個」他們趕着、老鼠逃着、可是他們竟也没有法子傷着他、</p>
<p>「快來、快來、一個老鼠被我夾着了、」阿二這樣的喊、這時有一隻老鼠被他用窗門夾着、可是老鼠仍舊能夠活動、牠從空隙中爬了出來、爬在牆沿上、阿大就是一棒、打落在書架上、再一棒、就結果了性命、阿大很得意從書架後面夾了出來、「現在你還能跑嗎、老鼠先生」、阿大感到精神的緊張肌肉的收縮、又加之報復的快感、不由的這樣的說了、可是馬上他想到假如這時他被人家追着而打得將死的時候、不知自已將要怎樣憤恨和悲傷呢、更不由的贊牠可憐了、</p>
<p>但是這想像馬上消失、他們又開始在捉第二隻了、第二隻居然被熱水袋壓着而成生擒了、阿大無疑地夾着牠塞在痰盂裏、那隻老鼠就被這樣的「正法」了、他們把牠搬到外面掘了一個洞埋了、</p>
<p>第二天阿二說、「我的手昨夜弄破了」、阿大没有說甚麽、這時他正睡在床上喘着、丨昨夜傷風了、</p>
<h3>失業之後　惠</h3>
<p>失業給與人的痛苦、好似濃重的霧降與一隻海行的輪船一般、雖然有强有力的馬達、聰明的經騐豐富的船主、到這地步是没有辦法了、我、年青、力强、天秉也還算不弱、靠自已力量的挣扎、享受了相當程度的敎育、可是生活却懷起獰笑來嘲弄我這在社會没有勢力的漂零人、我没有一天得到過安甯、現社會的生活是給我很多的訓練了、我會去盡力營鑽卑聲下氣去找任何工作來做、我一些不會厭憎某種工作是太不合我的胃口、太辱没我的天才、正好如我的窮胃口一樣、得到食物都吞吃進去、從無厭甜酸苦辣、然而我用盡我可憐的力量所能找到的工作總是橡修馬路一般的短工、路坍了請你來修、修好了我又是一員蕩馬路的游民了、</p>
<p>這幾天的天氣是嚴重寒冷、滿天壓着白華華的雲塊、尖利的風到處嗚咽着不是預言家也知道在最近中又要降雪了、冷並不能限訓我工作的精神、就是重雲大雨、在我都是温和的晴空一般、可是在找不到職業如喪家犬一般茫然溜着馬路回到我的亭子間時、我像一支斷了弦一般的弓陡然倦乏下來、躺在床上、睜着眼看看天花板、連嗜讀的書也没心去望一望了、何况容易咀嚼的書籍都在這幾日看完了、所留下的只是幾本生硬的理論書了、我充分感到一切都是和我不親善、一切都在獰笑我、</p>
<p>在平時我總是在中夜十二時睡、早晨七點就起來工作、可是現在我完全反常了、我竟提前六小時就睡了、當黄昏窺探我窗口的時候、我會睡到第二天中午十一時起身、像普通上海人一般、好像這時候起來還覺太早、賴洋洋去弄些熱水洗臉、</p>
<p>有時我會想起、「晤、這是太頽唐了」「不、不、」我因爲覺得没有一件事做呵、」我這樣很有力的解答、</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Song Shang et al. Jointly Send Inauguration Telegram</h3>
<p>Zhang Telephones Song and Others Urging Immediate Reorganization and Dismissal</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, Pang Bingxun, Sun Kuiyuan, Yang Xiaoou, Feng Pengzhu, Sun Chu, Yang Chengyuan, Wang Jingguo, Yang Yaofang, Li Shengda, Zhou Dai, and others jointly sent an inauguration telegram on the 6th, saying: Respectfully presented to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government's various Yuan (Councils), Ministries, Committees, various Provincial and Municipal Governments, Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, various Commanders, Supervisors, and military division and brigade commanders. The case involves a confidential telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Chiang, and the Deputy Commander Zhang, appointing Zheyuan et al. as military division and brigade commanders, and issuing letters of appointment, etc. In compliance, we respectfully assume office on the *day of this month. Materials are insufficient and responsibilities are heavy, with constant fear of failure. We respectfully request instructions to be issued at any time. This is our earnest prayer. Also, a joint telegram to Chiang and Zhang says: The case involves a confidential telegram from Xian (Deputy Commander Zhang) appointing Zheyuan et al. as military division and brigade commanders and issuing letters of appointment. Zheyuan et al. comply and assume office on the *day of this month to implement reorganization and dismissal. We respectfully report this. (Special Dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Wang Shuhan and Qi telegraph Jing Yaoyue, saying that the Deputy Commander-in-Chief does not hold any prejudice regarding the matters you presented, but for the sake of Shanxi Province's finances, even if acting according to the Tianjin proposal and assuming responsibility, it is already quite substantial. If there is still surplus strength in military salaries, then adding some troops is not impossible to consider. It seems that financial strength should be the standard. (Special Dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhang telegraphs Song Zheyuan and others, saying that if the military situation is not resolved for one day, the people's burden cannot be lifted for one day. Please promptly begin reorganization and dismissal to alleviate the people's suffering. (Special Dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The telegrams to Commander Zhang requesting instructions and the telegrams announcing assumption of office by the various military division and brigade commanders have been drafted and will be sent soon. The contents of the telegram requesting instructions, in addition to reorganization and dismissal according to the Tianjin agreement, taking into account the actual situation of the Jin-Sui Army, involve changing Sun Chu's unit into a road protection army with Sun as the commander, under the command of Gao Guizi's unit. Also, Zhang Huizhao's division will be reorganized into a garrison force, with Rong Honglu and Zhang Huizhao serving as the commander and deputy commander. The cavalry reorganization will still be handled by Zhao Chengzhou, who will be reassigned as the bandit suppression commander. The contents of the telegram announcing assumption of office are extremely brief, merely stating that we comply with the order for reorganization and dismissal and assume office on a certain date.

<p>(Beiping) Shen's request to the Jin Army for the establishment of a road protection commander has not yet been approved by Zhang. Currently, the Jin Army intends to use the names of garrison troops and bandit suppression troops to accommodate the surplus personnel from the eight reorganized divisions, and to place Sun Chu, Zhang Huizhao, Zhao Chengzhou, etc., but has not yet received Zhang's approval. Also, two points were telegraphed to Shen a second time: 1. The hope is to reorganize and dismiss in phases. 2. The hope is to avoid mutual troop transfers, to prevent special levies from the people during the mobilization. (Special Dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wen Shouquan arrived in Tianjin from Beijing on the morning of the 10th and will take the evening train to Beiping, while You will return to Taiyuan.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The British Foreign Secretary's Warning of Future War Disasters</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Henderson delivered a speech at the Disarmament Conference. On one hand, he emphasized the importance of today's disarmament. On the other hand, he warned that if disarmament is not successful, the future war disasters will be far greater and more terrifying than before.</p>
<p>He said, "If people do not want to reap the benefits of disarmament, then the horrors of future wars will be incomparable to previous wars. Military experts have said that the last war was just sporadic killing. Future wars will be mass slaughter." His words meant that the weapons used will definitely not be the previous rifles and cannons. Their effectiveness will be such that many people will lose their lives at the same time. He also said, "We all know that it is beyond our power to practice humanitarianism in war. Once war breaks out, no one can control the killing instinct and prevent this barbaric behavior." This shows that the so-called prohibited items during war are all superficial words. If there is a chance to win, anything will be done.</p>
<p>He also said, "The only way to stop this barbaric behavior is to stop the war itself. If the war cannot be stopped, once it breaks out, the number of lives destroyed will be beyond our imagination. If the destruction continues, all our civilization will perish from this." His words meant that there is no other way to prevent the disaster of this war except to do our best to achieve disarmament.</p>

<h3>German Parliament Resolves to Amend Rules of Procedure</h3>
<p>Proposals from Opposition Parties to Be Restricted</p>
<p>Important Victory for Bruning's Cabinet</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin Shimbun (National News) Berlin, 9th - Today, Bruning's cabinet once again achieved an important victory in the Parliament. After an unusually heated debate, the motion to amend the rules of procedure was finally passed by a majority. This time, the National Socialist Party, the National Power Party, and the Communist Party all strongly opposed it, accusing it of restricting the opposition party's tools and violating the rights granted to the Parliament by the constitution. However, the government party strongly argued that its role is to rectify the order of the Parliament, eliminate disruptive work, and focus on construction work, which will definitely help restore the lost dignity of the Parliament. After the passage of this bill, any suggestions proposed by the members in the future must pre-arrange the source of funding, and the opposition party's proposal of no-confidence motions and impeachment motions has also been restricted. In addition, the Parliament also passed a bill prohibiting members from enjoying the privilege of not being arrested when serving as editors of newspapers and magazines, in order to avoid abusing the privilege and publishing propaganda against the Republican government and the constitution. Observing the current trend in the Parliament, it is expected that the government will not find it difficult to obtain the majority's approval on budget and other important proposals.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin Shimbun (National News) Berlin, 10th - The German Parliament's late-night meeting did not end until 3:00 AM this morning. During the meeting, the opposition parties, such as the National Socialist Party, the National People's Party, and the Communist Party, withdrew from their seats to protest the government's new measures. However, in the final vote, 300 votes indicated their unwillingness to oppose the government. After this turmoil, the meeting time was extended. The members, after a short rest, still plan to continue the meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Encounters Disaster Mid-Voyage</h3>
<p>Kikusui Maru Collides with French Mail Ship</p>
<p>Only Twenty-Five Out of Ninety-Four People Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu (Telegraphic Communication Company) Kobe, 10th - At 7:40 PM last night, the Kikusui Maru (350 tons), belonging to the Amagasaki Steamship Company, departed from Kobe to Shodoshima amidst heavy snowfall. When it reached a point two nautical miles west of the Hiraiso Lighthouse off Tarumi Town, Hyogo Prefecture, it suddenly collided with the French mail ship Paul Lecat (12,692 tons) of the Messageries Maritimes Company, which was sailing at high speed towards Shanghai. The Kikusui Maru immediately capsized and sank at 8:40 PM. Among the 67 passengers and 27 crew members of the Kikusui Maru, only 25 were rescued. All the others seem to have drowned. At that time, the Kobe Maritime Police Station and the Kobe branch of the Amagasaki Steamship Company received an emergency report of the Kikusui Maru's disaster. The youth corps and firefighters of the Tarumi Town Fisheries Association were mobilized and rushed to the scene. Due to the heavy wind and snow, the location of the sinking could not be identified, and the rescue work was extremely difficult and was temporarily suspended. This morning at 6:00 AM, rescue work was resumed and the sunken ship was searched. Due to the continuous rain and snow since the previous night, the work was extremely difficult. The 69 passengers and crew members are now all dead.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu (Telegraphic Communication Company) Kobe, 10th - Regarding the news of the Kikusui Maru accident, according to later reports, the collision occurred suddenly, and the captain was not in the wheelhouse at the time. The helmsman was a first-class operator, and they failed to take emergency measures, resulting in a large number of casualties. The accident occurred in the center of the Akashi Strait's tidal currents, causing all the survivors to drift away, making rescue hopeless.</p>
<h3>Madeira Island Labor Unrest Not Expected to Widen</h3>
<p>One Theory Says the Disturbance is Increasing</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Funchal, 9th - A strike and disturbance have occurred on Madeira Island, west of the coast of Morocco. The High Commissioner Leal and the new Governor of Madeira, Maia, have both arrived there with full authority to resolve the labor unrest. They brought troops from the capital and a destroyer is anchored off Funchal. Although the workers who initiated the labor unrest claim that they will not return to work until the ban on the import of foreign flour is lifted, the labor unrest is now showing signs of decline.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin Shimbun (National News) Lisbon, 10th - The disturbances on Madeira Island are increasing day by day, and have recently taken on an anti-foreign tone. As a result, ships that have recently docked there have been stoned by the people on shore. The port authorities there have now erected signs to prevent foreign ships from entering, for the sake of peace. Therefore, the German merchant ship Hamburg, which originally planned to sail to the area, has changed its course to Casablanca to avoid the disaster after receiving a radio message.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliamentary Dispute</h3>
<p>The Minsei Party Members' Meeting Approves Compromise</p>
<p>And Agrees to Drop Charges Against Violent Assemblymen</p>
<p>Internal Party Commotion Ensues</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – The Minsei Party held an official members' meeting at 6:00 PM on the 9th. Interior Minister Adachi, acting as president, gave a speech stating that the budget session had been disrupted, causing regrettable delays in proceedings. To resolve this deadlock, he met with Mochizuki Keisuke of the Seiyukai party for negotiations. Following Mochizuki's illness, Adachi, at the Seiyukai's request, visited Seiyukai president Inukai Tsuyoshi at his private residence, urging Inukai to pacify his party members and prevent further disruption of parliamentary proceedings by violence. Inukai agreed, promising his best efforts to resolve the situation. Subsequently, compromise negotiations began, and an agreement was reached. Adachi acknowledged that he had acted independently, without prior consultation with the other members, which he considered presumptuous. However, he explained that he acted on behalf of the party and requested their understanding. He acknowledged that the majority might be dissatisfied with the compromise terms, but asked them to consider his position and approve the agreement. Morita, the chief secretary of the Diet, stated that while there were dissatisfactions with the compromise, they understood the government's predicament and had no choice but to approve it. He requested a vote on the approval, which passed unanimously. Next, the meeting discussed withdrawing the charges against Seiyukai assemblymen. After a report by the Pro-Japanese assemblymen's group, Secretary Morita proposed that the decision to withdraw the charges was a matter of great importance and should be left to the discretion of Interior Minister Adachi. Adachi responded that he would resolve the matter with the spirit of constitutionalism and Bushido. Finally, Miki Bukichi, who had remained silent for some time, spoke, stating that his party had originally decided that Foreign Minister Shidehara had not misspoke. However, if it was unavoidable to resolve the situation, Shidehara should be allowed to save face before the people by adopting fair and open methods. Regardless of what the Seiyukai or the Diet may say in theory, the Seiyukai was solely responsible for the chaos in the budget session. This should be clarified. He stated that the charges against the Seiyukai's violent assemblymen should absolutely not be withdrawn. As a result, the members' meeting did not approve the withdrawal of the charges.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – Although Minsei Party members such as Miki Bukichi approved the compromise between Inukai and Adachi, they vehemently opposed the withdrawal of charges against the violent assemblymen. They argued that since the government had retracted the Prime Minister's statement as a mistake, it should demand a quid pro quo, requiring President Inukai to apologize for the violent incidents. They believed that agreeing to withdraw the charges was a humiliation, not a compromise, and questioned whether the Interior Minister himself approved of the violence in the Diet. Some criticized Interior Minister Adachi for this. Adachi explained that while there were regrettable aspects, he sought the best possible solution, excluding emotions, for the sake of the larger picture. He earnestly requested their understanding and approval of the withdrawal. However, the opposition persisted, and the members' meeting last night passed a resolution opposing the withdrawal of charges. This issue was the only remaining unresolved matter in the compromise agreement and was deferred for resolution today. Last night, party officials separately sought to pacify the younger members. Prime Minister Hamaguchi also hoped for the prompt implementation of the compromise to facilitate the proceedings. Therefore, it was expected that the party would ultimately comply with the government's wishes and approve the withdrawal of charges.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – Seiyukai Secretary-General Mori Kaku visited Interior Minister Adachi and Justice Minister Eki Tetsuo at 6:30 PM last night, requesting the government and party to respond to the compromise agreement reached between President Inukai and Interior Minister Adachi. Interior Minister Adachi replied that the Minsei Party members' meeting had not yet approved the withdrawal of charges against the violent assemblymen in the compromise agreement but would definitely implement it as agreed within the day. Secretary-General Mori understood and left, promising to meet again.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – Although the issue of Foreign Minister Shidehara's alleged misstatement has been resolved with the approval of the compromise by the Seiyukai and Minsei parties, the previously suppressed younger members are showing signs of reigniting their opposition to Shidehara. The grievances of the discontented elements can be summarized as follows: 1. The stagnation of important policies is due to the lack of unified belief within the cabinet regarding Shidehara. 2. Foreign Minister Shidehara's misstatement has put the entire government in a disadvantageous position, causing great confusion to the Minsei Party. 3. The members' meeting admitted that it was not a misstatement, but now it is being admitted as a misstatement and retracted, which is contradictory. The constant disagreements are due to the lack of unity within the cabinet and Foreign Minister Shidehara's lack of control. Consequently, while some are seeking to oust Foreign Minister Shidehara, the anti-Adachi faction within the Miki group is extremely dissatisfied with Interior Minister Adachi's attitude regarding the compromise. It is uncertain when this will erupt. In short, turmoil has broken out within the 270-member majority.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – The Seiyukai executive committee met twice yesterday, at noon and last night, and debated the compromise agreement, with divided opinions between hardliners and softliners. Ultimately, it was decided to approve the compromise agreement unanimously in the spirit of trusting President Inukai. The Seiyukai members' meeting, which is most qualified to make this decision, is holding a meeting in the Diet this morning to report the executive committee's decision and seek their approval.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) – The younger members of the Minsei Party are adopting a strong stance against the withdrawal of charges. This morning at 10:00 AM, some members held a meeting in the Diet, absolutely opposing the withdrawal of charges and ignoring the advice of the executives. Another secret members' meeting was held at noon to discuss the matter. The discussion was heated, and no consensus was reached. It was not until 1:40 PM that a decision was made to allow the executives to handle the matter, conditioned on maintaining peace in the Diet. The issue was then resolved.</p>
<h3>US Naval Construction Program Postponed for Discussion</h3>
<p>▲ Washington, 9th (Kokumin) – Republican leaders in the House of Representatives resolved today to postpone the naval construction program bill for discussion until the next session of Congress. The bill allocates $74.4 million for naval construction, which is the first step for the United States to comply with the 1930 London Naval Treaty. The reason for the postponement is that the short session of the 71st Congress will adjourn on March 4, leaving insufficient time to deliberate on the bill.</p>
<p>▲ Washington, 9th (Kokumin) – A bill to allocate $300 million for naval expenditures starting July 1st of this year was introduced in the House of Representatives today. This amount is $33 million less than last year's, reflecting the authorities' intention to reduce the strength of US warships. According to Secretary of the Navy Adams, the United States will have a total of 196 ships of all types next year, which is sufficient for its needs. Furthermore, due to President Hoover's advocacy, personnel reductions in the navy are also necessary to avoid waste. It is reported that the navy will be reduced to approximately 79,700 personnel, while the Marine Corps will be reduced to 17,500 personnel.</p>
<p>▲ Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The Appropriations Committee submitted the annual naval appropriations bill to the House of Representatives today, advocating for significant reductions in the number of personnel and ships in the US Navy. The proposed appropriation is $343 million, $36 million less than this year. The committee advocated for substantial reductions in the number of students at the Naval Academy and personnel on ships. The bill allocates $31 million for naval aviation, $1 million less than this year, but states that the ambitious program to equip 1,000 aircraft within five years is expected to be completed at the beginning of the next fiscal year.</p>
<h3>France Forms Special Committee to Consider Sky Defense</h3>
<p>▲ Paris, 9th (Kokumin) – The Supreme Military Council, chaired by the President of France, approved several proposals for defending against aerial attacks today and formed a special committee, chaired by General Pétain, to specifically consider the issue of sky defense. General Pétain has resigned from his previous positions as Inspector General of the Army and Vice President of the Supreme Military Council, which have been assumed by General Weygand.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech on Disarmament</h3>
<p>▲ London, 9th (Reuters) – British Foreign Secretary Henderson spoke at a disarmament promotion meeting tonight, stating that reducing military forces through international agreements is an initial acknowledgement by all nations that their naval, land, and air forces are not only related to themselves but also to others. It is also an acknowledgement of an important obligation that military preparations should no longer be based on a country's unrestricted desires but should be part of the common affairs of the international community. The Geneva Disarmament Committee has drafted disarmament measures. The subsequent course of action depends on how each government completes this work. The numbers that each government inserts into these measures depend on public opinion. If the people want disarmament, they can have it. Friends of peace have one year to rally public opinion and support this great opportunity, which may not come again. If the people do not want disarmament, the horrors of future wars will be incomparable to past wars. Military experts have stated that the last war was selective killing, while future wars will be mass slaughter. We all know that humanizing war is beyond our power. Once war breaks out, no one can control the killing instinct. The only way to stop this barbarity is to stop war itself. We must know that if war does not break out, life and property will be spared. But if it does, the destruction will be beyond our imagination, and all our civilization will perish. The world's current economic plight and widespread unemployment are all consequences of the last great war. World trends can only be addressed through world actions, which is international cooperation on various economic issues. How can there be such cooperation if each country's policy is based on preventing war? Today's increased tax rates, trade restrictions, and economic nationalism are all the result of the national interest concept arising from the fear of war. Today, Europe is filled with difficult political problems, just as it was five years ago. As a high-ranking diplomatic official of a major power, I dare to say that the key to peacefully resolving various problems lies in disarmament.</p>
<h3>Indian Governor-General Replies to Gandhi</h3>
<p>Best Not to Dwell on the Past</p>
<p>▲ New Delhi, 10th (Reuters) – Gandhi previously wrote to Indian Governor-General Irwin, requesting a thorough investigation into the police's mistreatment of non-violent protesters and offering it as a test case. According to the Hindustan Times' Allahabad correspondent, Governor-General Irwin replied to Gandhi, stating that the police's attitude was very good. He emphasized that volunteers of the All-India Congress Committee often fail to comply with the Congress's strict prohibition against the use of force. In conclusion, he wrote that the situation has changed, and it would be best not to dwell on the past.

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Decision to Establish the Headquarters of the Deputy Commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Zhu Guangmu Internally Designated as Secretary-General</p>
<p>Liu Guang Carries Tables of Organization and Seals to Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>From a correspondent in Fan Yang: The issue of establishing the headquarters of the deputy commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been under discussion for a long time without clear resolution. Since Zhang Xueliang returned to Shenyang, the matter has been decided through discussions with various key figures and correspondence with the central government. General Commander Chiang sent Liu Guang, Director of the National Defense Department of the General Staff, to deliver the tables of organization and seals for the headquarters of the deputy commanders. Liu arrived in Shenyang on the 1st of this month. According to reports, the headquarters of the deputy commanders will be established in Beiping. Zhang will go to Beiping to organize its establishment after the lunar new year. The headquarters will be organized into seven departments: staff, secretariat, general affairs, military law, military medical, adjutant, and logistics. There will also be two chiefs of staff and secretariat. The seven departments will have a total of over 200 personnel, who will be announced by Deputy Commander Zhang soon. It is rumored that Zhu Guangmu has been internally designated as the Secretary-General. The monthly budget will be 50,000 or 60,000 yuan, which has not yet been decided. The authority of the headquarters is to act on behalf of the commander-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and to implement military matters in the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Nanjing will be abolished, and a general commander's office will be established in Beiping. Deputy Commander Zhang will also establish a deputy commander's office in Shenyang. The organization of the office will be simple, with personnel concurrently serving from the Border Defense Command. The Border Defense Command will naturally remain in existence, but it is rumored to be undergoing reorganization and is currently under planning. It is reported that after assuming the position of deputy commander, Zhang Xueliang will spend one-third of his time in Beiping handling the affairs of the headquarters of the deputy commanders and two-thirds of his time handling the affairs of the Northeast Border Defense. Zhang will continue to concurrently serve as the commander of the Northeast Border Defense. The rumor that Zhang will focus solely on the position of deputy commander and appoint Zhang Zuoxiang as the commander of the Border Defense is inaccurate. (February 6)</p>
<h3>Northern Financial Conference Postponed</h3>

Jing Youyan, special commissioner of finance in Hebei, proposed that all contracted donations and taxes, whether they belong to the country or to the local government, should be abolished and directly collected by the official authorities. Those who are restricted by conditional contracts due to unexpired terms may temporarily maintain the status quo, but should still be abolished upon expiration. (4) Unify the consumption tax rate and no longer re-levy after a single tax. Liaoning Finance Director Zhang Zhenlu proposed.

Liaoning Finance Director Zhang Zhenlu proposed. It was decided that tax-exempt items should comply with central regulations. Tax-exempt permits should be issued by the financial authorities. (9) The provinces and cities in the Northeast region follow the orders of the Executive Yuan to abolish transit dues and reform the unified tax, special tax, and business tax. There are preliminary issues and subsequent issues. Please decide on the specific articles and publicize the decision. Jilin Finance Director Ronghou proposed. A, preliminary issues. 1. It is necessary to first designate which of the old donations and taxes in the provinces and cities of the Northeast should be recognized as transit dues and which should be recognized as similar to transit dues, so that it is known which should be abolished and which should not be abolished. Only after the types to be abolished have been determined can the estimated amount of loss be known. Should the provinces and cities in the Northeast each submit a detailed list of the donations and taxes to be abolished for review? This should be decided first. After discussion, each province and city will submit a detailed list of the tax items to be abolished for review and submit them within one or two days. 1. Abolishing transit dues and similar transit dues. The old donations and taxes of each province and city have inherent losses, and there are also losses from reforming the unified tax and special tax. There are inherent losses in national taxes and provincial local taxes, and there are also losses in county local taxes. Should the various losses be divided into separate lists for review? This should be decided first. After discussion, separate lists of the total amounts of national taxes, provincial local taxes, and county local taxes should be prepared and submitted within two days. 1. The ministry has designated five types of goods subject to the unified tax and nineteen types of goods subject to special consumption tax. What types of goods subject to the unified tax and what types of goods subject to special consumption tax are currently available in each province and city? It is not possible to have all of them or none of them. Should a list be prepared for review? This should be decided first. After discussion, the original designated types and estimated tax amounts, as well as the proposed additional types and tax amounts, should be submitted to the review committee. Please submit them within one or two days. 1. Among the five types of unified tax designated by the ministry, only the tax rates for cigarettes and wheat flour are fixed. The tax rates for the remaining three types (matches, cement, and cotton yarn) have not been promulgated. Should we wait for the ministry's regulations to be promulgated before complying, or should the committee first review and unify the regulations? This should be decided first. It was decided that we should wait for the ministry's regulations to be promulgated before verifying and implementing them.</p>
<h3>Zhang Huizan Killed in Ji'an</h3>
<p>▲ Head Transported to the Provincial Capital for Burial</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Zhang Huizan, commander of the 18th Division of the Ninth Route Army, formerly the main force in the central route for suppressing Zhu and Mao, led the 52nd and 53rd Brigades on New Year's Eve last year, taking the lead and penetrating deep into the enemy's lair when advancing from Donggu to Xingguo. However, due to the dense mountains and winding paths, when they reached Longgang, Zhu and Mao's main bandit forces had already occupied the high ground and surrounded the officers and soldiers. Commander Zhang, facing overwhelming numerical disadvantage and impassable roads, eventually ran out of ammunition and reinforcements. Commander Zhang was then captured by the bandits. According to a clerk who escaped from the 104th Regiment of the 52nd Brigade, after Commander Zhang was taken to the bandit lair in Xingguo, Zhu and Mao initially treated him well and repeatedly tried to persuade him to surrender officers and soldiers and trick them into handing over weapons and ammunition. Zhang remained unyielding. Zhu and Mao, realizing that Zhang was difficult to use, held a false central meeting and decided to kill Commander Zhang on the 28th of last month in Futian (on the border of Ji'an) and cut off his head, placing it in the Jishui River to float downstream. On the 2nd of this month, sentries from the 77th Division saw a large one-sided plaque from the Zhang clan ancestral hall floating downstream on the Ji'an River, covered with red cloth. They retrieved it and saw a human head placed on top, labeled as Commander Zhang's head, along with reactionary propaganda and rebellious slogans. The sentries then took the head to Ji'an City, where it was identified by former members of the 18th Division and Zhang's relatives as Zhang's head without a doubt. Therefore, it was sent to the provincial capital on the 6th. Chief of Staff Xiao of the 18th Division led all the officers to greet it at the division headquarters, set up an altar for mourning, and reported to Minister He and Commander-in-Chief Lu, and notified Zhang's family. Lu, upon hearing the news at the Nanchang Hospital, cried bitterly and was finally persuaded to rest by the doctor. Minister He telegraphed the central government about Zhang's martyrdom and requested compensation. The headquarters of the 18th Division established a mourning hall for Commander Zhang of the 18th Division to handle the funeral arrangements. The office issued a notice yesterday stating, "Respectfully announcing that Army 18th Division Commander Zhang Huizan died unyielding on January 28th in the Futian area, his remains have been brought to the provincial capital, and the coffin will be sealed at 12:00 noon on February 9th at the division headquarters." Zhang's limbs have not been recovered, so a wooden body has been made and joined with his head, dressed in a general's yellow woolen uniform, and placed in a camphor wood coffin worth over 1,000 yuan. Personnel below He and Lu personally mourned at the coffin. The entire 18th Division wore mourning attire and paid respects at the division headquarters, gazing upon the deceased's appearance, all with extraordinary grief. The provincial government has decided to allocate funds for the funeral, and various sectors will also launch a memorial service to express their condolences. (February 9th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Admonition to the Bandit Suppression Army</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: He Yingqin recently came to the province to actively plan for bandit suppression. Yesterday, the 5th, in the name of General Commander Chiang, he telegraphed the bandit suppression armies of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, urging them to abide by it uniformly to facilitate military operations and preserve the reputation of the military. The telegram read, "Protecting the people is the natural duty of soldiers. Disciplining the ranks is the key to victory. The scourge of the communists is not easily defeated, and there are a few troops who do not observe discipline, resulting in the loss of public trust. Consequently, people fear the army and favor bandits, the danger is simply indescribable. I hereby list six items that you must order your subordinates to comply with: (1) Exert every effort to protect the people, and from now on, there shall be no rude or impolite behavior. (2) Do not forcibly take a single blade of grass or tree from the people, nor forcibly conscript laborers or levy grain. (3) Strictly prohibit the protection of opium and gambling. (4) For checkpoints and inspection stations set up by various units, officers should be sent to supervise the inspection of passing luggage, and there must be no deliberate obstruction, detention of innocent people's luggage, or confiscation of money and goods on false pretenses. (5) Except for duty errands, soldiers are strictly prohibited from going out freely. (6) Transportation facilities, such as ships and automobiles, should be specially protected, and no units may arbitrarily detain them without the order of the local senior commander. All my soldiers must know that the people are the lifeline of the army. The above six items must be absolutely obeyed to facilitate the progress of the bandit suppression military and preserve the reputation of the military. If treated as mere formalities, severe punishment will be imposed according to the law. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin acting on his behalf."</p>
<h3>He Jian Sends Large Army to Suppress Communist Bandits in Zixing</h3>
<p>▲ Departing in Five Routes</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The area around Chaling and Youxian in eastern Hunan, bordering Lianhua, Jinggang, and Ninggang in Jiangxi, has been a place where communist bandits have appeared over the past year. The largest bandit groups are the forces of Chen Shao and Tan Sicong. Chen and Tan are both from Chaling and recently graduated from middle school. They joined the Communist Party in 1924, initially seizing local militias and organizing the Black Killing Squad in Chaling, taking advantage of the policy of suppressing bandits here and fleeing there to launch uprisings. Afterwards, their power grew, and the number of people joining them increased, each having over 1,000 rifles and twice as many personnel. Originally, they were based in Yantang and Yaoshui in Chaling. He Jian, because Chaling and Youxian were important gateways to eastern Hunan, personally went to Youxian last month to survey the terrain and build fortresses, and transferred the entire Tao Liu Brigade of the 19th Division and the entire Qi Guangzhao Bandit Suppression Third Detachment, concentrating them in Youxian and Chaling to suppress them in three routes. On the 26th of last month, they broke through the bandit nests of Yantang and Yaoshui. The two bandits Chen and Tan then fled to Lingxian. Lingxian had no troops, and County Magistrate Sun Zeying led over 1,000 local militia members. Unable to resist when the bandits arrived, they abandoned the city and fled. The communist bandits then occupied the county seat of Lingxian on the 30th of last month. Brigade Commander Tao Liu Fei ordered the two regiments of Tang Xin Zhao and Chen Hanxiong to rush to suppress them, and telegraphed Zi Rugui to prepare his regiment in Guidong to block them. Tang's regiment advanced from Chaling along Kengkouchu and Mindu on the 1st, without any contact. By the 3rd, they had pursued and reached Lingxian. When the county seat was recovered, the bandits had already fled to Zixing with their troops the day before. Various agencies and houses in Lingxian County were burned, dozens of people were killed, and losses were heavy. Zixing also had no garrison troops. Only two teams of local defense forces were dispatched from Yongxing and Leiyang counties, together with the Zixing local militia, totaling over 1,000 people, led by Zixing County Magistrate Yang Yu. They repeatedly engaged and blocked the bandits at Xinkeng, Penggong Temple, Zhou Mensi, and the county seat, but all failed and had over 100 rifles seized by the bandits. Unable to withstand the pressure, they abandoned the county seat at 12:00 noon on the 4th and retreated to Dongjiang to await reinforcements. Thus, the county seat of Zixing was occupied by the bandits again at 2:00 PM on the 4th. Zixing is in the hinterland, indicating that the communist bandits have infiltrated from the border into the hinterland. Therefore, He Jian paid great attention to this and urgently dispatched a large army to encircle and suppress them, as follows: (1) Order Tang Xin Zhao's regiment to pursue the bandits from Lingxian to Zixing. (2) Order Chen Hanxiong's regiment to take a shortcut from Chaling Anren to Longhaitang and advance south towards Zixing. (3) Order He Ping's regiment to advance towards Zixing West from Yongxing. (4) Order Hu Xiang's regiment to advance towards Zixing East from Guidong. (5) Order Chen Long, the Hunan South Garrison Commander, to lead twelve local defense teams from Yizhang Doutousi and advance towards Zixing North. (6) Order Duan Heng, the Hunan South Garrison Commander, to station in Chenzhou and command the above corps to suppress them severely along different routes. The total encircling force is over five regiments, to be concentrated before the 7th for a general offensive. The telegrams from various parties reporting the fall of Zixing are recorded below: (Telegram from Zixing County Magistrate Yang Yu) The communist bandits from Lingxian have all fled to Zixing. The Zixing local defense forces engaged the bandits in a fierce battle in the Xinkeng area and were defeated. Together with the Yongxing local defense forces, they engaged the bandits in fierce battles in Penggong Temple, Zhou Mensi, and other places, but were defeated again and again, and retreated to the county seat. The bandits followed and attacked. I immediately went out of the city to reorganize the troops and defend it. The Leiyang local defense forces arrived in the county to join the suppression. After fierce fighting, the county seat was captured by the bandits. I, carrying the official seal, along with the county party committee and all subordinate agencies, retreated to Dongjiang with the Leiyang local defense forces. I beg you to dispatch a large army to suppress them swiftly and rescue the people of Zixing with utmost urgency. Zixing County Magistrate Yang Yu, respectfully submitted, from Dongjiang. (Telegram from Hunan South Garrison Commander Duan Heng) According to reliable reports, in addition to the two gangs of Chen Shao and Tan Sicong, the red bandits who captured Zixing also include the gang of Li Tianqi. Li is from Leiyang, and most of his gang members are from Leiyang and have fled from the Jiangxi border. Recently, communist bandits have been discovered in Feitian, on the border between Hengyang and Leiyang. They lie in ambush at night, and robberies and killings are frequently heard. Communist bandit slogans are also frequently found on the road. I would like to request you to order Brigade Commander Tao to move to Leiyang to suppress and trấn áp them. Duan Heng, respectfully submitted. (Telegram from 19th Division Brigade Commander Tao Liu) I have just received a telegram from Commander Duan stating that the bandits who captured Lingxian fled to Zixing at the end of the day, and the local defense forces were slightly defeated and retreated to the west bank of Dongjiang to await reinforcements. I have ordered Chen Hanxiong's regiment to take a shortcut from Chaling to Zixing in the early morning to suppress them. Tao Liu, respectfully submitted. (February 7th)</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Implements Austerity Measures</h3>
<p>▲ Reorganizing Revenue and Reducing Expenditures</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Hunan Province, following orders to abolish Likin taxes, suddenly lost 600,000 yuan in monthly revenue. Zhang Kailian, the Director of the Department of Finance, felt constrained and personally went to Beijing last month to present everything to Chairman Chiang, Minister Song, and others, and requested assistance. In the end, the central government subsidized Hunan Province with 200,000 yuan in political expenses each month. After Director Zhang returned to Hunan, he planned overall. Hunan Province's political expenses required 1,030,000 yuan per month, while under revenue items, (1) the central government subsidized 200,000 yuan, (2) the business tax could collect 100,000 yuan per month, (3) regular and miscellaneous taxes could collect 100,000 yuan per month, (4) the land tax could collect over 200,000 yuan per month, totaling 600,000 yuan per month. There was a difference of over 400,000 yuan between revenue and expenditure, and it would be impossible to maintain without implementing austerity policies. Therefore, a plan for austerity was drafted and submitted to He Jian for approval. The measures were divided into two categories: reorganizing revenue and reducing expenditures. According to Zhang Kailian, if implemented in this way, Hunan's finances could barely cope. The measures are recorded as follows: Measures to Reorganize Revenue (1) All fines from county governments and public security bureaus, water police teams, grain inspection offices, etc., should be included as regular income, and not be concealed, encroached upon, or disposed of by the agencies themselves. (2) The revenue from party dues and party flowers should be temporarily retained to offset party expenses. (3) All judicial revenue at all levels should be retained in full to offset judicial expenses and not be remitted to the central government. (4) All surplus profits from official businesses and mine taxes remitted to the central government should be temporarily retained in full for treasury allocation. (5) Each school's tuition fees and product income should be deducted and remitted by the Department of Finance according to the originally listed budget amount. (6) Reorganize the business income and highway donations of the Highway Bureau and use them as engineering costs for the road bureau, and the provincial treasury will not subsidize them for the time being. (7) For provincial funds received by each county, except for land tax, tooth tax, and various fines, which can be used locally, the remaining deed tax, slaughter tax, and boat donations should all be remitted to the treasury for special projects and not be used locally arbitrarily. (8) The Department of Construction has a large amount of inventory of Cili realgar, Xiangtan tin sand, and Shuikoushan black and white aluminum sand. They should be quickly converted into cash and handed over to the treasury to facilitate turnover.</p>
<p>Measures to Reduce Expenditures (1) Except for revenue collection agencies and agencies with originally listed budget amounts of less than 200 yuan, the office expenses of all agencies shall be issued at 80% of the original amount. (2) Each competent official shall be responsible for removing superfluous personnel from each agency, breaking away from personal feelings, and truly streamlining them. In addition, agencies under their jurisdiction that are superfluous or consume resources, as well as agencies for non-urgent projects, should be truly merged by the competent officials, and the names of the dismissed personnel and agencies should be reported to the provincial government for approval and implementation. (3) No additional expenses shall be added for any item of expenditure that is not listed in the budget. (4) For all construction and repairs and additions exceeding 500 yuan, regardless of whether they have been listed in the budget or not, except for materials and equipment fees for projects that have been completed, contracted, or should be stopped, no requests for payment shall be made on any pretext. (5) For all temporary expenses listed in the budget or approved, the Finance Department Review Committee may suspend payment if it believes that payment can be delayed or that the expenditure is uneconomical. (6) No military temporary expenses shall be diverted or allocated from provincial funds from each county in the future. (7) The expenditures of any agency shall be requested from the provincial treasury and shall not be diverted or allocated from each county. (8) For all education expenses, except for the salt tax surcharge and tuition fees and product income, which are fully used to offset expenses, if there is a shortfall, the competent agency shall evaluate and reduce non-urgent items to ensure suitability, and the treasury will not temporarily compensate for it. (9) Projects that have been listed in the budget or decided to be newly added, but are considered to be delayed, shall not be established for the time being. (10) For expenses that have not been listed in the budget in the future, each competent agency shall deliberate and reject them and shall not arbitrarily propose additional ones. (11) Special expenses of each agency shall be suspended. (12) The expenditures of each government-operated agency shall be truly reduced by the competent agency in conjunction with the financial department. (13) The Minsheng Factory has a huge investment, and it should be started as soon as possible. The expenses shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale of goods. In addition, the official paper printing bureau and the disabled veterans' factory have had tens of thousands of yuan of funds allocated from the provincial treasury. Once the machinery is stopped, it will inevitably rust. The competent agency shall find a way to auction it or solicit merchants to lease it. (14) For bank funds that have been appropriated for military expenses, the loans should be recovered, and the mineral sand stored in the Construction Department should be converted into cash and returned. Business should be started immediately, and corner notes should be issued to facilitate turnover. (February 8th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Completes Streamlining</h3>
<p>▲ Total of Four Divisions, Three Artillery Regiments, and One Independent Brigade</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Han Fuqu's Third Route Army originally had Sun Tongxuan's 20th Division, Cao Fulin's 29th Division (each division with three brigades, each brigade with three regiments), Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division, Zhan Shutang's 73rd Division, Qiao Lizhi's 74th Division (each division with two brigades, each brigade with two regiments), and Lei Taiping's pistol brigade. In addition, the 20th Division also had Li Xuande's mortar regiment and Sun Shulin's artillery regiment, and the 29th Division also had Wang Yuzhang's artillery regiment, totaling five divisions, one independent brigade, and three artillery regiments. Before the new year, they were ordered to streamline. Sun Tongxuan and Cao Fulin's two divisions were reorganized into Category A divisions, and Gu Liangmin's division was a Category B division, with the division commander numbers remaining the same. Zhan Shutang's division was reorganized into the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division, and Qiao Lizhi's division was reorganized into the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division. However, Han believed that there were too many artillery pieces, and there were no artillery regiments in the new organizational system, so he requested approval from the central government to keep the three artillery regiments of Sun Shulin, Li Xuande, and Wang Yuzhang. However, because there were still too many surplus officers and it was difficult to place them, he requested approval from the central government to reorganize Qiao Lizhi's 86th Brigade into the 74th Division, according to the Category C division organizational system, with Qiao as the division commander. The two brigade commanders will be selected from the three regimental commanders of that brigade: Ma, Fu, and Zeng Chen Zhaoxin. Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division is a Category B division, with two brigades per division and three regiments per brigade. Therefore, the two regiments of Li Yizhi's 66th Brigade were merged into Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade, and Li was transferred to be the commander of the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division, formed by selecting one regiment each from the 85th and 87th Brigades of that division. Currently, both Qiao and Li have gone to Beijing for training. After returning to Jinan, they will begin streamlining. Lei Taiping's pistol brigade is directly under the provincial government, and the salaries of the former two Shandong garrison brigades will be transferred to the brigade's salaries. Han's Third Route Army has now completed streamlining, with a total of two Category A divisions, one Category B division, one Category C division, three artillery regiments, and one pistol brigade directly under the provincial government. The division and brigade numbers and the names of the commanders are recorded as follows: (1) 29th Division, Commander Cao Fulin, 85th Brigade Commander Li Hanzhang, 86th Brigade Commander Li Yizhi, 87th Brigade Commander Rong Guangxing, Artillery Regiment Commander Wang Yuzhang. (2) 20th Division, Commander Sun Tongxuan, 58th Brigade Commander Zhan Shutang, 59th Brigade Commander Zhao Xinde, 60th Brigade Commander Ma Jingong, Mortar Regiment Commander Li Xuande, Artillery Regiment Commander Sun Shulin. (3) 22nd Division, Commander Gu Liangmin, 64th Brigade Commander Ning Chunxiao, 65th Brigade Commander Tang Yaoxun. (4) 74th Division Commander Qiao Lizhi. (5) Pistol Brigade Commander Lei Taiping, 1st Regiment Commander Jia Benjia, 2nd Regiment Commander Wu Huawen. (6th)</p>
<h3>Min Qian Yuguang's Troops Rebel and Capture Ningde</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Yu and Zhuo companies under Qian Yuguang's troops rebelled and fled from Guping to the Huotong area under Ningde County's jurisdiction, pressing on the county seat. The provincial government received a telegram from Chen Huisheng, the guerrilla captain of Guping, and immediately telegraphed Zhou's Battalion of the First Land Brigade stationed in Gutian to Ningde for reinforcement. However, before Zhou's Battalion arrived, the county seat of Ningde was captured on the 3rd of this month, with widespread looting. However, the rebel soldiers, hearing that reinforcements were coming, retreated to the Shitou area that night and regrouped various bandit gangs, hoping to make another attempt. The reinforcement troops sent by the province have been rushing there day and night. Furthermore, the Ningde Chamber of Commerce also sent a telegram to the province yesterday reporting the situation, which read as follows: "The bandits captured Ningde on [day] and looted extensively. The bandits have temporarily retreated to a place thirty miles from the city. It is learned that the reinforcements are not many and are still gathering various bandit gangs to make another attempt. The whole city is in danger. Please order a large force to rush to support." According to a certain source, after the rebel soldiers of Qian's troops invaded Ningde County, they originally planned to attack the county government, but because there was still a shed of soldiers stationed in the county government, they were unable to succeed. In addition, the troops stationed in Qidu rushed to the scene overnight upon hearing the alarm, so they automatically retreated to the Shitou area. In this battle, 13 bandits were killed and 6 garrison troops died. The area around the east gate was particularly ravaged. (6th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government's Large Loans</h3>
<p>▲ 5.5 Million Loan in Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ 1.5 Million Loan in Hangzhou</p>
<p>In order to repay the power plant bonds and raise funds for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway loan, the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent Director Wang of the Department of Finance to Shanghai to borrow 5.5 million yuan from the Shanghai banking group using the Hangzhou power plant as collateral. The process is as follows: (1) Banking Group Organization: The group was launched due to the large amount of the loan, and was jointly organized and funded by nine banks in Shanghai, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Industrial Bank of China, China Development Bank, Yanye Commercial Bank, etc. It also appointed seven people as directors, including Zhang Zaiyang, Li Fusun, Hu Bijian, Jin Runquan, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhuzhai, and Shen Weizhen, with Zhang as the chairman. It is said that it is named the Hangzhou Power Plant Shanghai Banking Loan Group, but the office is located in Hangzhou. Its functions are to manage the reforms of the factory, supervise the profits and losses of the factory. The group has one secretary and several staff members to handle paperwork. The position of accountant is very important and will be carefully selected and assigned. After the loan is established and managed by the banking group, the factory director and section chiefs will be retained to achieve familiarity and efficiency. The banking group is expected to start work around the end of February. (2) Loan Amount: This loan was negotiated by Director Wang of the Department of Finance in Shanghai with the Shanghai Banking Group with the help of Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce. The amount is 5.5 million yuan. The two sides have contacted and there are already some signs. The content is that the Hangzhou Power Plant is transferred to the banking group for management, and the accumulated profits of the factory over the years are used as interest. It is also heard that the banking group is granted a 30-year patent. After the contract is signed, the profits and losses of the factory's business will have nothing to do with the government. The loan will be paid in six installments, with one installment every 15 days, to be paid off in three months. The formal contract will be signed when the first installment is paid.</p>
<p>Another report: Because the provincial treasury is extremely tight and the funds are owed and urgently needed for distribution, the Department of Finance has negotiated with the banking sector for a loan of 2 million yuan several times. As a result, the banking sector decided to lend 1.5 million yuan. The contract was signed yesterday (9th), with an interest rate of one cent, for a term of six months. The Department of Finance will still use the 2.2 million yuan in foil taxes from the entire province as collateral. Of the 1.5 million yuan loan, 250,000 yuan must be deducted for the previous loan from the Daguan Consolidated Donation. The net current payment is 1.25 million yuan. It was also decided through consultation that the banks and money shops would allocate funds as follows: Bank of China will take on 300,000 yuan, local banks 150,000 yuan, and the remaining 800,000 yuan will be allocated by nine banks, including the Bank of Communications, Deyiye Bank, Industrial Bank of China, China Development Bank, Yanye Commercial Bank, Savings Bank, Chufeng Bank, Huidi Bank, Dalu Bank, etc. The remaining 400,000 yuan will be allocated by the major peers of various money shops. The funds are scheduled to be collected by the 10th and transferred to the Bank of China for transfer to the Department of Finance for verification and collection. (10th)</p>
<h3>Northeast First Fleet Commander Ling Xiao Talks About the Current Situation of Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Cold Market in Weihaiwei</p>
<p>▲ Berthing Situation of Northeast Navy Ships</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Ling Xiao, the commander of the Northeast Navy First Fleet stationed in Qingdao, came to Harbin on the afternoon of the 3rd from Shenyang. His visit was to attend the funeral of Shen Honglie, the commander of the Northeast Navy, which was held in Liaoning on the 29th of last month. There are many acquaintances in Harbin, and quite a few people took time to meet him. I visited him at Room 81 on the third floor of the New World Hotel on the afternoon of the 4th and asked him about the current situation of Weihaiwei and the Northeast Navy. According to his account, since the takeover of Weihaiwei, the commercial market has been deserted and not as good as before. During the British management era, Weihaiwei was used as a free trade port, and no customs duties were collected. The local products of various cities and towns along the coasts of Shandong and Jiangsu were mostly transported by sailboats to Weihaiwei for concentration, so the commerce there was developed. After our side took over, customs duties were levied. Originally, Weihaiwei was located between the three major ports of Dalian, Qingdao, and Zhifu, and there was no railway to connect it, so it had no competitive qualifications in principle. Once customs duties were levied, the local products along the coasts of Shandong and Jiangsu mostly shifted to other ports to seek better sales. The commerce of Weihai Port became sluggish. A month ago, local merchants petitioned the National Government to reduce or exempt customs duties. The central government, constrained by treaties, found it difficult to grant a single exemption and did not approve it. The naval authorities intended to develop it as a naval port, which could slightly revitalize commerce, but it would require tens of millions of funds to do so. Therefore, there is no way to save the current decline of Weihaiwei. In reality, Weihaiwei has several disadvantages compared to Jiaozhou Bay: (1) There is no railway connection, so berthing warships will feel a lack of supplies and difficulty in obtaining fuel. (2) There are winds and waves in the port in winter, and only one corner of Liugong Island can avoid the wind. (3) The water in the port is shallow, and the large ships are often attacked by wind and waves, making them unstable. If it is Jiaozhou Bay, large ships can be berthed on both the north and south banks of Qingdao. In the hot summer, the ships can be berthed on the north bank, and in the cold winter, they can be berthed on the south bank. Therefore, foreign ships often come to Jiaozhou Bay in summer to escape the heat (currently, no foreign ships are berthed). As for the Northeast Navy, since the reorganization has not been completed last year, it is still directly under the Northeast and has little direct relationship with the Navy Department. All the salaries are also not assisted by the central government. In the first quarter of 1929, I was ordered to go to Nanjing to participate in the naval reorganization meeting. Although it was an opportunity for the Northeast Navy to approach the central government, I returned because the methods had not been thoroughly negotiated. The First Fleet currently has six warships, all berthed in Qingdao. It does not undertake maritime defense duties. Sometimes, when it goes out on patrol, it also sends out all the ships. Among the ships, the Zhahe is younger, and the Haiqi is older. The headquarters of the First Fleet is located in Qingdao. The naval officers on each ship guide each other in academic studies and cut and polish each other. There is no special school for training. The headquarters of the Second Fleet is stationed in the Changshan Islands, with four gunboats, specializing in maritime patrol and defense. For the convenience of patrol, the north and south banks of Chengjiao Mountain have been divided into two sections, each patrolled by two ships. Huludao and Weihaiwei are patrolled by these two ships. Maritime defense cannot be as clearly divided as land routes. The First Fleet acts as a whole, while the Second Fleet operates in shifts.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Wang Caiyun Loan Case Opens in Court: Wang Caiyun, a 27-year-old woman from Anhui residing at No. 344, North Lane of the Old Gate Bridge in the Shanghai British Concession, sang Suzhou ballads at the Tianyun Building of the Wing On Company. She met Yin Xianfu, who resided at No. 2 opposite the Baiyun Temple on Linyin Road in the South City, in the 7th month of the lunar calendar in 1928. Yin, under the pretense of needing urgent funds for business, borrowed 2,000 yuan from Wang Caiyun, promising to pay interest at 1.8% per month and repay both principal and interest by the end of the lunar year 1929. Yin personally wrote the IOU, but failed to repay the loan by last year. Wang Caiyun repeatedly demanded repayment but was ignored. On July 6th of last year, Wang Caiyun hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court to recover the loan. After the trial concluded, the court ruled that Yin Xianfu should repay the loan in full. Yin, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, hired lawyer Ni to appeal to the High Court.

<p>Wang Xinyu's Speculation Failure, Continued: Wang Xinyu, the manager of the Qianfeng South Goods Store at Duting Bridge, engaged in gold standard speculation in Shanghai and failed, involving the store and various banks and money shops that had dealings with the store. Representatives from each bank and money shop arrived at the store the night before to audit the accounts and inventory. It is now learned that after the representatives audited the accounts, they believed that the store had a significant amount of outstanding loans and could be maintained. Furthermore, since the store was an old establishment of over 60 years, the shareholders were reluctant to order it to close down immediately. Therefore, the store continues to operate as usual. A representative has been sent to Shanghai to find Wang Xinyu and bring him back to Suzhou to handle the situation. However, as of yesterday, there was still no news of Wang Xinyu's return. It is rumored that Wang Xinyu's speculation losses amount to 180,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Representatives of Various County Chambers of Commerce Schedule a Meeting: When Jiangsu Province organized the collection of business tax registration fees last year, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various county chambers of commerce in Zhenjiang and established a temporary joint office to achieve mutual assistance. The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the government has implemented the business tax and the implementation period has arrived. The formulated tax regulations not only exceed the ministry's guidelines, but the tax rates set in Jiangsu Province are also higher than those set in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. They have jointly contacted the chambers of commerce of various counties and sent telegrams to the ministry and province, requesting detailed review and revision. Since the National Government and the ministry have not yet issued clear instructions, the local chambers of commerce have repeatedly requested that the provincial chamber of commerce hold another meeting to decide on a solution. It has been scheduled to meet in Zhenjiang on February 25th. A comparative table of various tax rates has been prepared and opinions are being sought from local chambers of commerce to be presented for discussion at the meeting.</p>

<p>Shenjiawan Robbery Reported and Under Investigation: Zhang Qingchen, the village head of District 396 of Nanyan City in the county, lives in Shenjiawan. At around 10:00 PM the night before, over 20 bandits, all speaking with a Jiangbei accent, broke open the back door and rushed in. They first tied up Zhang Qingchen with ropes, forced him to reveal the location of the silver, and carried out a major robbery, stealing over 100 yuan in clothing and silver.</p>
<p>Two Fires Result in Three Deaths: In the fifth district of the county, the home of Shen Xijiu, a wealthy resident of Chentang near Shitou Town, was using a stove for warmth recently because the weather has been very cold. On the night of the 8th, at a little after 1:00 AM, the coal ashes poured out of the stove were not completely extinguished, and the fire spread, piercing through the roof. At that time, the entire Shen family was sound asleep. Later, Shen Xijiu's wife, Liu, noticed and woke up the family members. Unfortunately, one nephew was unable to be carried out from his bed. Liu returned to the room to carry out her nephew, but both were caught in the fire and were buried in the flames. The next morning, Shen Xijiu hired workers to dig out the bodies, which were like charred wood. The scene was very tragic. Also, at the home of Jiang Axu, a resident of Jiangxiangshang near Qianzhou in the fifteenth district, a fire broke out suddenly at a little after 12:00 AM the night before. Fortunately, firefighters from the town arrived and were able to extinguish the fire, but the house they lived in was completely destroyed. After the fire broke out, Axu's mother, who was 77 years old, was unable to walk due to her advanced age and also died in the fire.</p>
<p>New World Hotel Caught Stealing Electricity: The Qishuyan Power Plant's office in Wuxi has recently discovered that many electricity users are stealing electricity, and has organized an inspection team and sent out many inspectors to investigate. In recent days, many electricity users have been caught stealing electricity. At 10:00 PM the night before, inspectors discovered that the seal on the electric meter box of the New World Hotel under the Gongyun Bridge outside Guangfu Gate had been moved, and there was a piece of iron wire in the electric meter box. The inspectors immediately questioned the hotel's accountant, who was evasive. They then took down the electric meter box and reported back to the factory. The factory, upon receiving the report, intends to follow the electricity theft punishment rules promulgated by the Construction Committee, which stipulate that electricity thieves should be charged electricity fees based on the highest electricity usage month in the past year, calculating the electricity consumption for the year as compensation for the loss of stolen electricity. The hotel should compensate between 6,000 and 4,000 yuan. The factory now plans to hire a lawyer to file a complaint with the county court.</p>
<p>Abnormal Plant Growth, Winter Vegetables Bloom: The weather in the county last winter was unusually warm and cold, causing summer weather to occur in winter, with three thunderstorms. The last two occurred in late January, when the weather was unusually warm, like the third month of the lunar calendar. This led to the outbreak of an epidemic in the market. According to elderly farmers, winter thunder is the omen of misfortune. The recent epidemic in the market confirms this belief. Recently, winter vegetables planted in the county's fields have suddenly bloomed. According to elderly farmers, this is also an omen of misfortune. This is recorded for plant scientists to study.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Reformatory Decided to Expand: The Wujin County Government previously convened a countywide administrative meeting and decided to expand the reformatory to accommodate more vagrants, due to the increasing number of vagrants in the area. After County Magistrate Zhang took office, he proposed the expansion for discussion at the county administration meeting on the 9th. It was decided to implement the expansion measures: (1) Temporary expansion expenses will be advanced by the Finance and Property Department. (2) The recurring expansion expenses will be based on the number of increased inmates starting from March of this year. The director of the reformatory will create a table at the end of each month showing the actual number of inmates and the required expenses, and submit it to the county government for transfer to the Finance and Property Department for advancement. (3) All temporary and recurring advances will be listed in the budget for the 20th year. (4) The vagrants added to the reformatory will be limited to those transferred by the county government or the bandit suppression bureau, with a maximum of 60 people. Vagrants sent by the district offices will still be handled as usual.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>True or False: The Maojia Bridge Robbery and Kidnapping Case: The Shen Tongshun oil mill in Maojia Bridge outside the North Gate of this county was robbed on the 16th of last month, and the manager Yao Shou and employee Xue Guanxing were kidnapped. After County Magistrate Tan and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang visited the area for an on-site investigation the next day, the county ordered the case to be solved within five days. However, before a few days had passed, Yao and Xue suddenly returned, claiming that the bandits had released them unconditionally. Everyone who heard this believed it to be true. However, recently, society has been abuzz with discussions claiming that Yao Shou embezzled a large sum of money from the oil mill and was unable to make up for it, so he faked the robbery in an attempt to shut down the business. There are six points of suspicion in this case: (1) The neighbors on either side did not hear anything on the night of the robbery and kidnapping. (2) When the county bureau chief and others went to the area for an on-site inspection, Yao's wife replied that she did not know anything. (3) It is said that the robbers came from and left through Gengjingkou, where water police and police teams are stationed, so they should not have been completely unaware. (4) According to the account, there were only two or three guns among the robbers, so how dare they rob in a place only three or four miles away from the city? (5) Since Yao Shou was kidnapped, why was he released unconditionally? (6) Since Yao and others were released, why do they always avoid appearing in public? The above six points are indeed very suspicious. Now, various creditor groups have heard the news and are rushing to demand payment. The authorities will also conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the truth.</p>

After investigating the results, it was reported to the provincial government after a discussion by the review meeting. The 357th meeting resolved to assign Sha Bingyuan and 37 other people to each contribute 2,000 yuan, designating 50,000 yuan as the Zhou Shuiping Memorial Elementary School Fund and 26,000 yuan for tomb repair and pension.

After drafting the handling procedure, it was reported to the provincial government for instructions. After the defendants pay the full amount, they will report to the government so that the property can be unsealed and the arrest warrants can be revoked. As for the memorial elementary school, it should be handled by the county magistrate and the Education Bureau. After receiving the order, Magistrate Li believed that after the defendants were wanted, they had all fled to other places with unknown addresses and could not be notified.

Han, the squadron leader, immediately handed them over to the detective team for custody and preliminary investigation. It was learned that the bandits were reported by an informant to be residing at the home of Wang Xiaolai in Xuejia, Yiling, who had many male and female bandits speaking with a dialect from south of the river. Wang, the squad leader, dispatched plainclothes police with weapons to investigate. They found four or five men and women at Wang's house. When the police arrived, the women blocked the door, and the men entered the house and escaped over the wall. The police opened fire to pursue them and captured Xu Chunnian and Wang San on the spot. They then searched Wang's house and found stolen goods. During the preliminary investigation, Xu confessed that he had participated in the robbery of the Dada Yantai steamer at Minhekou on December 12th and did not deny sharing the loot.

<p>Elementary School Principals Request Prompt Salary Payments: The teaching fees for all elementary schools in Yangzhong County have only been paid up to the first half of December. Elementary school teachers in general are suffering because the accounting period for the business community is approaching. At the principals' meeting held by the Education Bureau on the 8th (today), the principals of various elementary schools questioned the lack of transparency in the collection and expenditure of teaching fees. Director Wang Huankun stated that the number of county government payments not allocated was still large and ordered the principals to elect representatives to petition the county government.

After the authorities persuaded the rickshaw pullers to resume work first, they convened representatives from both sides to hold a meeting for mediation. It is now learned that on the afternoon of the 9th, the Construction Bureau of the County Government specially convened representatives from both labor and management to hold a mediation meeting. After a long period of dispute between the representatives of both sides, County Magistrate Gong mediated a compromise, stating that if it is a daily rental, the daily payment is 4.2 jiao (an increase of 2 jiao according to the regulations). If it is a monthly rental, the daily payment is still 4 jiao. The representatives of the car companies signed on the spot, but the representatives of the rickshaw pullers did not sign. Therefore, it is feared that the mediation will not take effect.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from the Fourth District Office of Jinshan County</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read in the Songjiang Correspondence column of your newspaper on February 4th that "dozens of bandits suddenly came to Ganxiang Town and went to the Public Security Bureau and the District Office, intending to coerce the leaders of each to point out the names of more than 30 wealthy households in the town and demand 12,000 yuan to raise funds. As a result, in addition to robbing police weapons, they also took away a list of wealthy households." This is not entirely consistent with the facts. At that time, the bandits came to the town and wrote five letters of demand, requesting the District Office to forward them, but the assistant sternly refused. As a result, the bandits delivered them directly. The police weapons of the Public Security Bureau were not robbed. Fearing that rumors would be untrue and confuse the public, I have written this letter to state the actual situation and request that it be published in the Letters column for correction. Sincerely, Fourth District Office of Jinshan County.</p>

<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Yunnan Provincial Education Association</h3>
<p>(Yunnan Correspondent) At 12:00 noon on January 25th, the Provincial Education Association held its inaugural meeting at the former site of the Provincial Education Department in Changchunfang. Those in attendance included Chairman Long, committee members Chen and Chen from the Provincial Party Committee, Education Director Gong Zhongjun, dozens of representatives from various institutions, organizations, and schools, and over 100 county education representatives. The ceremony was conducted in accordance with etiquette. After distributing declarations, Zhao Shuren, the chairman of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations. Chairman Long then gave instructions, stating that the Provincial Education Association had previously only sought the interests of a few people and its own association. Now that it has been reorganized, it is hoped that it will fulfill its due responsibilities to the country and society. Next, Chen Zhenzhi, a member of the Provincial Steering Committee, gave a speech, stating that Chinese education had previously suffered from two problems: impracticality and a lack of talent, and the transformation of party education into a religious ritual, which was not practical. He hoped that the association would strive to innovate after its establishment. During this period of political tutelage, educational construction is the primary task of political and economic construction, eliminating laxity and cultivating orderly and trained talents. Education officials have a great responsibility and are expected to work hard. Then, Education Director Gong of the Education Department gave a speech, stating that the reorganization and establishment of the association are very different from the past in terms of the way they are produced and the organizational foundation. In the past, it was only organized by a few people from the education community in the provincial capital, and each was equal in form. Now, it is based on the counties and united by the Provincial Education Association. The voice can express a new spirit. In the past, education only focused on senior urban male assets, etc., and in the future, attention should be paid to junior rural female poor people, etc. The province's education plan is planned to be divided into two sections: one section for high schools and above and specialized universities, which can be named higher education, focusing on maintaining and enriching, and temporarily not expanding, so that it can be scientific and modernized, and the European and American systems can be adopted, with the primary goal of creating practical construction talents. One section for junior high schools and below and popular compulsory education can be named national education, focusing on promotion and perfection, so that it can be popularized, and only the Chinese system can be adopted. This is the common goal of our education colleagues. In addition, I hope that everyone will pay more attention to research, investigation, and statistics to supplement the shortcomings of the educational administration agency. Also, the most important thing for the education community in this province to solve now is the teacher issue. The Jiangsu correspondence method is proposed to be imitated, such as the salary issue of primary school teachers, which will be subsidized by the province in the future, and the scholarship fund will also be raised by the government. In short, I hope that educational colleagues will work hard. Then, Representative Yang Tianli replied, saying that he would follow the instructions of the leaders and committee members, and colleagues would promote reform and realization. Then, after tea and snacks, slogans were chanted, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned. It is reported that the Education Department plans to take advantage of the visit of representatives from various counties to the province to hold a temporary education advisory meeting on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of this month.</p>

(6) The position of Han-level director is abolished, and with the original funding, instructors are appointed as appropriate, but vocational schools with special circumstances may still retain the title of department head. (7) The salary standards for teachers and staff in provincial primary schools shall be increased as appropriate by the Department of Education in accordance with each school's 20th-year plan. (8) Each school's Boy Scout office expenses are $10 per month. (9) Each school principal's office expenses are increased by $10 per month.</p>

<p>▲Whether Employed or Unemployed, All Must Register</p>

The department, recognizing this, will start with education. All party comrades who have qualifications as primary or secondary school teachers, whether employed or unemployed, must register, compile a roster, and submit it to the competent authorities. When vacancies for principals or teachers arise, they will be given priority for employment so that they can display their talents.

However, their intellectual level is generally low, and it is urgently necessary to provide them with appropriate education so that they can become sound citizens. Therefore, the city has established a Labor Education Committee, and the relevant members have been appointed by the committee and the government as members of the committee. In order to urge progress, it is specially decided to jointly convene a meeting of the committee at 1:00 PM on Tuesday, the 11th of this month, in the conference hall of the party department to discuss measures and guidelines to ensure smooth implementation. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued to inform the members that they must attend the meeting at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>Twenty Organizations Host Dr. Carleton Washburne</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, the China Child Education Society, Shanghai University, the Real Sphere, the Chinese Student Association, and other organizations have jointly initiated a gathering of various groups and schools to host the American education expert Dr. Carleton Washburne. As previously reported, the organizations and schools that have joined include the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Xinwen Bao Newspaper, Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Labor University, Fudan University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, Datong University, Sino-French Vocational School, Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, and the China Children's Welfare Association, totaling twenty organizations. In addition to a public banquet at the Bankers' Association on the 15th, Dr. Washburne has also been specially invited to give ten lectures. Dr. Washburne's brief biography is introduced below:</p>
<p>Dr. Carleton Washburne comes from a scholarly family. His mother was a famous lecturer and the first editor of the Elementary School Education Magazine. His father was a doctor. Therefore, Dr. Washburne benefited greatly from his mother's teaching and was also inspired by his father. In 1912, he graduated from Stanford University. He initially worked for a real estate company, and then entered the education field, serving as a primary school principal, which allowed him to experiment with his individual teaching methods. However, due to a lack of understanding from the education authorities, the experiment was not successful. At this time, Brook, a famous educator who advocated breaking the class teaching system, happened to be the president of the San Francisco State Normal School. After reading Brook's educational thesis, "The Entrenchment of Teaching and Its Remedies," Dr. Washburne resonated with it and began to interact and discuss teaching methods with Brook. As a result, Dr. Washburne became a professor at Brook's normal school in 1914. Subsequently, Brook introduced him to Winnetka to experiment with Dr. Washburne's educational ideals. Thus, Dr. Washburne's individual teaching method became known to the world as the Winnetka Plan.</p>
<h3>Wing On Textile Factory Sends Personnel to Japan for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Wing On Textile Factory in Yangshupu produces high-quality products and has achieved business success. Recently, in view of the upcoming implementation of factory regulations by the National Government, the factory has been striving to streamline internal management to reduce production costs. It is reported that the factory is sparing no expense in sending Li Xizhao and Geng Xinyi to Japan to investigate the conditions of textile factories and workers' lives in major ports such as Nagasaki, Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo for reference. It is said that Li and Geng will depart this morning (the 11th) on the Nagasaki Maru to Japan. It is believed that after their investigation and return to China, they will make new contributions to the factory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commercial Night School Opens</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Night School held its 19th opening ceremony in the Chamber's conference hall at 7:30 PM on the 9th. At the same time, the graduation ceremony for the previous session was also held. More than 700 students attended. Principal Lu delivered an opening address, encouraging the students to study diligently and not to disappoint the Chamber's hard work in running the school. Academic Dean Zhang Jiashou reported on the academic achievements of the students in the previous semester. Clerk Zhu Boyuan introduced all the faculty and staff. It was learned that most of the original teachers of the school have continued in their positions, and in addition to the newly hired Academic Dean Zhang, Cao Xiaogu, a Bachelor of Arts from Shanghai University, Shu Shuxin, a graduate of Jinling University, and Zheng Jingxian, a graduate of Fudan University, have been newly hired as English teachers. Ding Jingshen, a graduate of Jiangsu Industrial School, and Su Boyin, a graduate of Nantong Textile School, have been hired as commercial calculation teachers. Lu Xinzhen, a graduate of the Department of Political Economy of Meiji University in Japan, has been hired as a Japanese teacher. Finally, the principal presented certificates and awards. Seven students graduated from the Chinese language department, twenty-four from the English language department, and two from the Japanese language department. One hundred and twenty-six students received awards. The lower English language class is already full, but there are still vacancies in the higher class and the Chinese and Japanese language classes. Those who wish to study can quickly register for admission. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Labor University Announces Important Staff Appointments</h3>
<p>Wang Jingqi, the new president of Labor University, is urgently reorganizing the university. In terms of administration, the original president's office has been reorganized and reduced to the General Affairs Office, and Lin Tongshi has been appointed as the director of the General Affairs Office, which is divided into five sections: Deng Zhongxi as the director of the Document Section, Lin Xiyi as the director of the Registration Section, Shen Zhaohua as the director of the Accounting Section, Song Xuchang as the director of the General Affairs Section, and Xu Songnian as the director of the Publication Section. Each section has several staff members and clerks. Zhou Bangshi has been appointed as the director of Moral Education, Xu Yanzhi as the director of Physical Education, and Yang Sifu as the person in charge of the Middle School Department.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Hires Accountants</h3>
<p>Jinan University's finances have always been handled by accountant Xi Yushu on a commission basis. Now, due to the heavy workload, accountant Xi has recommended accountant Sun Yu to handle all cash receipts and disbursements. The president has already approved the appointment. All accounting matters will still be handled by accountant Xi. Since the university implemented austerity measures during the winter vacation, the spirit of all departments has been invigorated.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Order for the West Qing Playoff</h3>
<p>Tonight is the final act of the West Qing Playoff. The match between Huadong and Mai Ling is the most important competition of this final act.

<h3>Jinan Football Zhenru Basketball Team's Philippine Campaign Record (11)</h3>
<p>(Reported by our reporter Wen Chu from Manila on February 2nd)</p>
<p>The Jinan Football Team and Zhenru Basketball Team's campaign in the Philippines has come to a successful conclusion. This campaign has opened up unprecedented honors for Chinese football in the Philippines (Nanhua and Lehua's victories are comparable, but not total victories). The athletes are about to set sail northward, all filled with joy. In the future, Zhenru's solemn and magnificent hall will surely hold a grand celebration, and the Huangpu River will also play the triumphant song. The reporter regrets not being able to attend the grand occasion in person, and can only write about the events before and after this event, as well as the details of the sports arena, and publish them in the newspaper as conversation starters for the welcome meeting.</p>
<p>▲I'll Show My Ugly Merits</p>
<p>The Zhenru football team played five games. The first game was against La Salle University, which was 3 to 3. The second game was against San Beda University, which was 3 to 2. The third game was against Santo Tomas University, which was 4 to 1. The fourth game was against the All-Nations United Team, which was 3 to 1. The fifth game was against the All-Philippine All-Star Team, which was 2 to 1 (although it was not completed because the audience caused trouble, but there were only five or six minutes left, so it was considered a victory). In terms of individual achievements, Chen Zhenhe scored a total of eight goals, Dai Linjing scored a total of six goals, Chen Jiaqiu scored one goal, and Luo Haiguang scored one goal. However, this victory was due to the coordination and support of all the players. Those in the front are naturally responsible for charging and breaking through, and those in the back are naturally responsible for clearing the invading enemy troops. The strength of the All-Nations Team and the All-Star Team is actually not to be underestimated. The defeat was due to everyone vying to make contributions and show off their own skills, so they ultimately achieved nothing.</p>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese Provide Great Support</p>
<p>The support of the overseas Chinese this time can be said to be extremely enthusiastic. The four Chinese newspapers unanimously did their best to promote and publicize the victory. When they won, they rushed to publish special editions to allow the general overseas Chinese to see the good news as soon as possible. At this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, and with sluggish business, the Philippine peso can be exchanged for more than two yuan in national currency and sent back to the motherland to comfort relatives and friends. How passionate! Even the most frugal and hardworking laborers spared three or two yuan, intending to cheer and show their usual accumulated national humiliation.</p>
<p>▲Entrance Ticket Revenue</p>
<p>The purpose of the Charity Association is to focus on the overseas Chinese aspect of the entrance ticket revenue. The more the motherland's team wins, the more enthusiastic the overseas Chinese will be to visit. In the first game, the revenue was only more than two thousand yuan. The result of the game was also a tie. It is said that the general manager Liu Qinggao looked worried and said that if the visiting team lost again, the revenue would be greatly affected, or even insufficient to cover expenses. Now it is very promising. According to Ying's announcement, the revenue from five basketball games was more than six thousand yuan, and the revenue from four football games was 21,000 yuan (the final game has not yet been announced). The total must be more than 30,000 yuan. The travel expenses, accommodation, venue arrangement fees, advertising and publicity fees, etc. for this trip for the athletes are only 15,000 yuan. This method of raising funds can be said to not require door-to-door begging. Everyone actively contributes. There were also Japanese martial arts fighters, but the entrance ticket revenue was not detailed because it was not paid attention to.</p>
<p>▲British and Americans Predict</p>
<p>After the first two games, British and Americans with sports knowledge said that the Jinan team would win. The reason is that they have a spirit of cooperation and the formation is not chaotic from beginning to end. Every time they serve, there is a response. Therefore, those who bet on the outcome all favored the Jinan team (that is, those who favored Jinan accounted for a clear majority over a minority).</p>
<p>▲Contacting Emotions?</p>
<p>In 1925, the Far Eastern Games were held in Manila, and there was a disturbance between the Chinese and Philippine football teams. In 1927, the Lehua football team also had a dispute with San Beda (the players who were defeated started to hit our players, they said they would not go, and the public opinion strongly attacked them). This time, the reporter was fortunate to have a complete result. However, even in the last few minutes, it was difficult to avoid an unfortunate fact. Although it did not harm the honor of the entire team, it also left a crack in the history of Chinese and Philippine sports. Please see the following interesting things to know that the disturbance was unavoidable.</p>
<p>▲Eating Porridge and Drinking Water</p>
<p>In the crowd, it is very appropriate to applaud and cheer as a proper way to cheer. However, every time the opposing team wins, the Filipinos must shout "eat porridge." This is because overseas Chinese are accustomed to eating porridge for breakfast and dinner, mocking us for being weak from eating porridge. If our team wins, the crowd shouts "drink water" to retaliate. Filipinos use water instead of tea, mocking them for being soft on water. Similar mutual ridicule and disagreements can lead to fights everywhere. Therefore, it can be said that international sports increase sports interest, improve sports standards, and express the national spirit of each country. However, if it is said to enhance the relationship between the two countries, it is actually the opposite between China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>▲Ashamed of Our Guests</p>
<p>This time, the sports event was not between the local overseas Chinese team and them at will. It was specially invited by the highest academic institution in our country, the championship team, to travel thousands of miles to create a scene for their charity association. However, the audience dared to insult our on-site staff, so it is no wonder that the overseas Chinese were embarrassed. The police also wanted to arrest our athletes, which was even more unreasonable. Fortunately, the people from the Charity Association ran around to mediate, and the city referee did not want to pursue the matter deeply. The police station's desire to prosecute and release the two Chinese was also withdrawn. I hope that from now on, the clouds will clear and the past will be forgotten.</p>
<p>▲Fortunately, All Athletes</p>
<p>During these three weeks, everyone in the streets and alleys talked about the victory in the stadium. Compared with the tens of thousands of tons of warships sent by the motherland parked in Manila Bay, it was even more animated. The prestigious names of Dai Linjing, Chen Zhenhe, Ming Taizu, Long-legged Immortal, etc., left a deeper impression on the overseas Chinese community than the visits of great men and the rich. I hope that the future athletes will rise up quickly. Warships and airplanes cannot be built in a short time. The only way to increase international honor for the motherland now is in the sports arena with the good skills of the athletes.</p>
<p>▲Special Respect</p>
<p>This victory is due to the efforts of every player. I have said it many times. However, there are a few people who should be given even more respect. Dai Linjing is the general staff and the dispatcher is appropriate, and the command is satisfactory. He is the reincarnation of Zhao Zilong, the victorious general of Changshan. Chen Zhenhe took the lead and was brave in charging, scaring the enemy with one foot. He is the younger brother of Guan Yu, Zhang Yide, the iron-faced general. Zhuang Shanhong firmly defends the center and coordinates effectively, and is as majestic as the Dharma protector Weituo. Feng Yunyou and Jiang Shanjing are bronze-footed and iron-headed, and defend the inner guards like the iron gate gods Shen Tu and Yu Lei. With them in their seats, ghosts dare not peep at the door. The remaining titles can remain the same.</p>
<p>▲Five Years and Ten Years</p>
<p>Someone familiar with the situation in China and the Philippines and who has a long-standing interest in sports told me that more than half of the Philippine athletes come from poor families and have reddish-brown skin, purely of Malay ethnicity, and have unattractive faces. For example, the basketball star Jacinto is like the son of Lai in the shadow play Fire Burning Red Lotus Temple. These athletes can be guaranteed to exercise their bodies for a long time in ten years without external temptations. If our athletes are all spirited, and now the communication between men and women in various universities is open, many queens, palace masters and school flowers are more willing to be close to the athletes who are welcomed by all in the sports arena. So in Chen Zhang'e's Philippine diary, he wrote that the tears of many lovers were seen off in the spring river as an embellishment for the journey. Then, the beauty will naturally be long and the heroes will be short. I don’t have to argue about whether someone’s words are true or reasonable. I only hope that all the athletes will maintain this indestructible body and be the pillars of the motherland. Don’t be like a ball that can’t roll out of the net once it enters the city.</p>
<p>▲The Whole Team Stays for Ten Days</p>
<p>One more thing to tell the readers: all the athletes were originally scheduled to return home today, but the fight case has been canceled and the carnival will open tonight. The Charity Association again pleaded to stay for ten days, and there will be several friendly football and basketball games. I will extend the happy brush and announce the future situation to you.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Words of Wisdom·Xu Jie·</h3>
<p>Many doors, many headaches. Many words, many things.</p>
<p>▲Circumstances are like writing an essay. A good essay cannot only have smooth strokes and no difficult strokes. Life should not only have smooth circumstances and no adversity.</p>
<p>▲Children are the decorations in front of the spirit altar a hundred years later.</p>
<p>▲Qi is the most important thing in life. As the saying goes, "Qi and strength." This is because there is strength only when there is Qi. As the saying goes, "Integrity." This is because there is integrity only when there is Qi. The Buddha said, "Life is between breaths." One does not die if one does not eat for a day, but one dies without Qi for a moment. How can the people of the world be dreamy, depressed and constipated, angry and hurt their Qi, and happy and consume their Qi, and only use medicinal stones for nourishment without following the ways of "nourishing Qi" and "taking Qi"? What is the use?</p>
<p>▲Water that is too clear has no fish. Crazy people declare that they are not in harmony with the world. Zhou Maoshu praised the lotus flower for emerging from the mud without being stained. This is indeed the way for a gentleman to conduct himself in the world.</p>
<p>▲I love the poems of Fang Weng and Yao Fu the most. Fang Weng's poem says, "Fang Weng does not care about the affairs of the world. The taste of sleep is infinitely sweet like honey." This is a good sleeping pill. Yao Fu's poem says, "Yao Fu is not fond of chanting poetry. Poetry is when Yao Fu is happy. Clearly dressed as a scholar. Talking about benevolence and righteousness as a man. Dare to open his eyes in the world. Willing to frown in the world. Sixty-seven years of uneventful days. Yao Fu is not fond of chanting poetry." When my father was alive, he loved to chant this poem. But now I can't hear it anymore. How painful!</p>
<h3>Recording the Loss of Our Nation's Books and Records – Qing Qu</h3>
<p>The flourishing of our nation's books and records began with stone inscriptions, followed by woodblock printing, and lastly movable type (invented by Bi Sheng, a commoner of the Song Dynasty). However, as the script transitioned from seal to clerical, from complex to simplified, from bamboo slips to paper, and with the rise of printing, books became more numerous, and readers began to take them less seriously. This is simply a sign of the times. Ye Mengde said, "Today, the best books are printed in Hangzhou, followed by Sichuan, and the worst in Fujian." This gives us a glimpse of the state of book publishing in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Leaving aside older examples, rare and secret books from the Song Dynasty are the most highly prized. Even during the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, only 30% of the books stored in the Wenyuan Pavilion were block-printed, with the remaining 70% being handwritten copies. This shows the limited extent of woodblock printing at that time. By the Wanli era, when an imperial decree was issued to collate the remaining books, only local gazetteers remained, with few classical texts surviving. This is why Song Dynasty printings are so highly valued. This year, the China Science Society held a book exhibition at the Mingfu Library on January 1st, displaying dozens of Northern Song Dynasty printed scriptures and Sui and Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, astonishing those who saw them. The society's efforts to promote national culture and collect scattered remnants are truly commendable.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Japanese reprints of ancient script versions of the Classic of Filial Piety and the Book of Documents, which are among our nation's oldest books. I wonder how they ended up in Japan. Furthermore, the Library of Congress in the United States holds over 1,700 types of Chinese books, totaling approximately 20,000 volumes, mostly consisting of collected works and private writings. These are recent exports. If we include previous exports, the total would be no less than 125,000 volumes, a truly astonishing figure. Some may not believe it, but news agencies like the World News Agency and the National News Agency have reported it clearly and authoritatively, not based on hearsay.</p>
<h3>Red Mud Splatters the City of Paris – Lü Bing</h3>
<p>During strong winds and heavy rain, thick clouds often bring unusual objects with them. Falling from the sky, they create a strange spectacle. Historical records mention rain of fish, rain of insects, and rain of frogs, which may be true and not entirely fabricated. The reason is that ponds and ditches may contain these objects, which are then swept into the air by hurricanes, enveloped in clouds, and carried for hundreds of miles before falling with the raindrops, astonishing those who see them. There is nothing strange about it.</p>
<p>Recently, the sky over Paris rained red mud. On that day, thick clouds gathered, unusually dark. Suddenly, the clouds dispersed, and rain fell, with each drop being a reddish-brown slurry. Instantly, roads, vehicles, and buildings were covered, as if a team of painters had dyed the entire city of Paris. In some streets, the accumulated red mud was about half an inch high, an unprecedented sight.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the red mud that fell in Paris came from the Sahara Desert, 1,500 miles away. It was blown into the air in northern Africa, drifted north, crossed the Mediterranean Sea, and finally landed in Paris, creating this strange phenomenon.</p>
<p>Moreover, the books of Yang's Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng have also been scattered and lost. The Song Dynasty editions of the collected works of Liu Zongyuan, Meng Haoran, and Meng Dongye were taken to Japan from Tianjin for 80,000 gold coins. One can imagine what else has been lost. This was one of the four great book collectors in the late Qing Dynasty, during the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras. Yet, his descendants could not preserve his collection. Although the losses were partly due to the chaos of war, those responsible for local culture cannot escape blame.</p>
<p>We have always lamented the burning of the Yongle Encyclopedia. Now, it is said that the British Library still holds over 80 volumes. How did they end up in Western hands? This raises many questions. Judging from this, the loss of our nation's ancient books is not merely a matter of neglecting them or letting them become dust. Even theft is tolerated, so that what was intended to promote national glory and embellish great undertakings must be begged from foreign countries decades later, seeking to pick up their scraps and feed them back to their motherland. Is this not truly sad and deplorable? Therefore, I bring this to the attention of the scholars of our nation.</p>
<h3>Recording a Shanghai Prophet's Enlightenment – Jue Mi</h3>
<p>▲ Today's Relocation of the Shanghai County Seat</p>
<p>▲ Predicted Twenty Years Ago</p>
<p>Zhu Cuifang, the former abbot of the western chamber of the Shanghai City God Temple, was a Taoist priest from Baoshan. His Taoist name was Yu Feng Daoren (Jade Peak Taoist). The Taoist was skilled in divination, and his predictions always came true. When Yuan Haiguan was the magistrate of Shanghai County, there was a severe drought. Despite banning slaughter and praying for rain, there was no rain. He consulted the Taoist, who predicted rain on a specific day and time. On that day, the sky remained clear, and the magistrate doubted the prediction. However, when the predicted time arrived, clouds gathered, and rain fell heavily, exactly as predicted. The magistrate presented him with a plaque praising his profound understanding of the Book of Changes. Later, when Yuan left office, the Taoist told people that Yuan would surely return. Years later, Yuan was appointed the circuit intendant of Songjiang, Songjiang, and Taicang, and indeed returned to Shanghai. The Taoist was a vegetarian, abstaining from meat and strong-smelling foods. He wore a Taoist cap and robe, appearing dignified, yet he was also carefree. Many scholars in the county associated with him, treating him as an equal. He was especially close to Zhu Zijun, a respected elder. The two would often visit teahouses to drink tea or taverns to get drunk. Before the Qing Dynasty banned opium, Shanghai was filled with opium dens. They would often lie on a couch in these dens. Although the Taoist was a recluse, he was not constrained by social conventions. When the Taoist went out, he often gave people a hint of what to expect. If the sky was clear with no clouds, showing no sign of rain, and the Taoist carried rain gear, then there would surely be a heavy downpour along the way. If the sky was overcast and showing no sign of clearing, and the Taoist did not carry an umbrella, then the rain would surely stop after he left. Sometimes, before going out, he would predict several things, and they would come true after he left. For example, if he said, "Going out today will bring minor setbacks and be wary of petty people," then there would surely be theft or loss of property that day. If he said, "Going out today will bring an unexpected encounter," then there would surely be an unexpected event that day. Sometimes, he would encounter something on the road and predict its future, and it would come true without fail. One day, while walking with Mr. Zijun, they saw a certain family building a temple. The Taoist sighed and said, "Although this temple is being built now, I fear that the day it is completed will be the day it is torn down." Mr. Zijun did not believe him at the time. However, later, when they passed by again, the temple was being torn down because it obstructed the road. One day, the Taoist was in an opium den, puffing away with several others. The den faced the city walls of Shanghai. He suddenly pointed at the city walls and said something extraordinary: "The city walls of Shanghai will soon be torn down." The even more extraordinary thing was that the Shanghai county seat would be relocated. This was probably during the late Guangxu era. People who heard this thought it was absurd and unbelievable. They did not believe it at all. After the revolution, the city walls were indeed torn down. Thus, the Taoist's prediction about the city walls came true. However, they still believed that the Taoist's prediction about the relocation of the Shanghai county seat would never come true. After the Shanghai county seat was reorganized into a municipality, those who had heard the Taoist's words believed that since Shanghai had been divided into a municipality and a county, the Shanghai county seat would surely be relocated as the Taoist had predicted. Now, the relocation is underway. Thus, the Taoist's prediction about the relocation of the Shanghai county seat has also come true. The Taoist passed away many years ago. When he made these predictions, it was over twenty years ago.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes on Cooking – Zui Chi Sheng</h3>
<p>In the art of eating, cleanliness and freshness are paramount. Then, with proper cooking and suitable combinations, the food will naturally be palatable, filling, and delicious. Even if Yi Ya were reborn, he would not go beyond this principle. Today, various regional restaurants in Shanghai are numerous, all claiming to employ famous chefs and emphasize cooking techniques. However, it is rare to find those that are truly excellent and flavorful. Often, lavish feasts are presented with novel designs, but upon closer inspection, one is left shaking one's head and frowning. There is no "value for money." This is simply because too much emphasis is placed on form, and the cooking is not up to par. Therefore, the problems can be summarized into the following three points, which I will discuss in detail below, hoping to contribute to improvement.</p>
<p>(1) Overuse of Seasonings</p>
<p>Things like "Ajinomoto" are used excessively, almost added to everything. I have seen cooks holding a bottle in one hand, sprinkling it arbitrarily, thus masking the true flavor. This creates a special artificial umami. Moreover, overuse of this substance can cause physical discomfort, such as dry mouth, thirst, and frequent bowel movements, as proven by many people with glucoseurea. This type of seasoning is meant to be used sparingly, so each bottle comes with a small ear-spoon-shaped spoon. The current excessive use defeats the purpose of the original creators.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Freshness</p>
<p>Regardless of the item, everything is placed in the refrigerator. Although they may last longer, even if the fish isn't spoiled or the meat isn't rotten, the meat becomes stiff and loses its original flavor. What is the point of overusing seasonings then? Fish, in particular, should not be stored for too long. Those who greedily use cheap "refrigerated" products are even more despicable.</p>
<p>(3) Excessive Greasiness</p>
<p>Whether it's soup, stir-fries, clear stews, or braised dishes, they are often thickened with starch, and the oil spills everywhere. The food is both oily and greasy, easily causing aversion and indigestion.</p>
<p>The above three points are the most prominent and are highlighted here. Those involved in the food business should reform and correct these issues so that both enjoyment and hygiene can benefit. As a gluttonous person myself, I have high hopes.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (98) – Liu Haisu</h3>

<p>We lingered in the courtyards, halls, and chapels, seeing many standing, lying, crouching, leaning against the walls, or looking up into the sky—gray-haired old men, struggling youths, lively and arrogant heroes, serene and beautiful goddesses—countless stone statues left over from thousands of years ago. These are famous Greek and Roman sculptures. Among these statues, the full chests and agile limbs are the most striking. Other details are also vividly expressive. All physical forms and postures have reached the most vivid and perfect realm. Even today's most precise and successful researchers of the human body would probably be unable to match them. There are also countless elegant fragments everywhere, all imbued with abundant and fulfilling life. Each one has the power and desire to step down from its pedestal. They are the condensation of human life from ancient times. They not only allow the glory and greatness of the Vatican to endure in the world but also allow the creative spirit of the ancients to endure forever. Strive! Strive for the expression of life! I thoroughly enjoyed these treasures of the Vatican. At that moment, I truly felt as if I were traveling in the past of thousands of years ago, intoxicated by the blue sky and sunny beaches of the southern lands. I felt that the human soul is forever bathed in clear or sorrowful sunlight.</p>
<p>However, I should also honestly write about my actual feelings here. In this Vatican filled with countless ancient treasures, there are also many modern paintings and sculptures on display. Comparing the two, there is a great difference. Being among the two creates different feelings. In particular, the latter can make us feel dull and mentally weak. The sculptures are mostly imitations of Greek or Roman masterpieces, with only artificial muscles, exaggerated postures, and stiff hands and feet for us to see. The so-called artist's individuality and imagination have all disappeared. This is what I deeply regret. Superficially, they seem brave and exaggerated, displaying a fierce and predatory appearance, but they do not give me any comfort. Not only that, but their artificiality makes me want to vomit for ten days.</p>
<p>The lively models of athletic competitions of strong and healthy nudes from the past are no longer seen today. They no longer pursue their legacy, nor do they want to absorb new inspiration. They simply imitate those Greek and Roman archetypes, concerning themselves with dull techniques and fixed theoretical methods. Therefore, they only have repetitive imitations and exaggerated works. The works are filled with their calculating skills, with no great inspiration directly revealed. They cannot create, only imitate.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Turns Declining</h3>
<p>▲ Seventeen and a Half Taels Slashed</p>
<p>▲ All-Day Wind, Fury, and Rain</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 10th, the gold market again trended downward, reversing the previous surge. However, the state was extremely confusing, as if mad and crazy. The raging waves were difficult to suppress. Throughout the day, there was a swing of twenty-two taels, causing widespread panic among traders. In the end, there was a sharp drop of more than two taels. Market trading was still active. In the morning session, Hengxing, Taikang, Dayi, Dade, Yuanxingyong, and others were buying, while sellers included Wanxing, Zhifengyongheng, Yu, and others. As for foreign exchange, it suddenly showed signs of decline, with posted rates remaining unchanged. This was likely because overseas silver markets were slightly lower, so there was no movement. Gold prices were weak early on. Later, various firms' cashiers differed, causing prices to rise and fall intermittently, fluctuating around eighty taels. The afternoon market was even more volatile. Taikang, Runyong, Fengyu, Da, and others were all buying, while Hengxing Tanfeng, Yongfuchang, and others were selling. Initially, the momentum was strong. The exchange rate once exceeded 790 taels. Drafts also showed profits. Afterwards, Indian money suddenly turned upward, and Shanghai's drafts turned loose and weak. In the fierce winds and heavy rain, the selling pressure in the market increased, almost to the point of decline. Suddenly, there was a drastic drop of twenty taels. People were fearful and anxious. Suddenly, the 770-tael level was broken. Such a market was like a floating duckweed, impossible to grasp. It is said that large traders will return to the market this morning.</p>
<p>▲ Seven Taels Down at Early Open</p>
<p>The March contract opened at 782 taels, down seven taels. Although large bars were down by one-eighth, silver prices did not change, and sentiment was immediately shaken. Subsequently, due to Dayi's purchase of a complete set, it rose by more than two taels to 84 taels and 70 cents. However, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengyu, and others came to sell, and banks mutually made spot deals first, causing 120,625 Taiwanese to buy Dalian at 1 tael 73 cents and 50 cents. The market was in a depressed state, plunging by about ten taels. By 9:10 AM, it was only 74 taels. Then, wheat firms absorbed three and four-month British gold at two pence, and Taikang, Runfu, Yu, and others bought, quickly recovering six or seven taels. When the telegraph price was announced, it was 81 taels, with posted rates remaining unchanged, slightly retreating to 79 taels and 50 cents. Before long, buyers became active, and by 9:45 AM, it was 82 taels and 80 cents. When Xinhneg and others sold, it retreated again to 79 taels. Around 10:00 AM, Hengxing, Taikang, Runfu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others rushed to buy, and British gold seemed firm. The March contract could be sold at 1 penny 937500, and at a quarter past ten, it had risen to 87 taels. Afterwards, Xinhneng, Hengyu, goods firms, and others had all sold, and the market turned downward. From 10:20 AM to 11:20 AM, there was a drop of more than six taels, with fluctuations of two or three taels up and down. Then, it was only 80 taels and 5 cents. After five or six minutes, it rose by more than three taels, reaching 84 taels, encouraging sellers. At 11:45 AM, it rose to 80 taels and 5 cents, and Hengxing and others bought again. At noon, it was 83 taels and a half. The closing price was 82 taels and 3 cents. Goods were still priced at 856 taels and 2 cents, a reduction of over seventy taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Waves Frequently</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 82 and a half taels. Later, due to a drop of 12 annas in the Indian exchange rate, Taikang, Runyu, Da, Yongfeng, and others made aggressive advances, and prices gradually rose. Drafts were also good. Banks engaged in deals with three-month British gold at 1 penny 937500. Sumitomo absorbed spot Dalian at 1 tael 74 cents and 75 cents. By 3:00 PM, it reached 91 taels. Then, it turned weak because it was reported that the Indian exchange rate had suddenly recovered by 10 annas, especially as the Shanghai market suddenly loosened. Banks bought April and May British gold at 2 pence 0625 and then had difficulty selling. At 3:20 PM, it was 77 and a half taels. In just over ten minutes, it rose by more than four taels. After 2:30 PM, the storm suddenly arose. Zhifeng, Yongheng, Xingyuanmao, Shui, and others in the market all came to sell. So the March British gold 2 pence 125 could be settled. In one fell swoop, it was down twelve or thirteen taels. By 4:00 PM, it was suddenly 69 taels. Afterwards, short sellers slightly covered, and it was heard that banks were dealing with one-month British gold at 2 pence 115. Therefore, it rose by four taels to 71 taels. It was then suppressed again to 70 taels and 5 cents, and then again to 71 taels. It was quite complex and difficult to grasp. The market closed at 4:30 PM at 771 and a half taels, a sharp drop of 17 and a half taels compared to the previous day. However, after the close, it again traded around 70 taels. The largest price for the day was 91 taels, and the smallest price was 69 taels, a swing of twenty-two taels. Low priced goods early in the morning were 82 and a half taels, noon closing at 82 taels, afternoon at 83 and a half taels, and closing price at 70 taels. Prices were suppressed by seventy-one taels and four taels to sixty-five taels. Before registration, the morning market was seventy-seven taels to eighty-two taels, and the afternoon market was seventy-one taels to seventy-six taels, with water replenishment at seventy-seven taels in the morning and seventy-one taels in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Turns Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British silver fell slightly, and American silver remained unchanged, but the British-American exchange rate rose. However, the Yokohama and Kobe markets did not experience prosperity or decline. As for Shanghai's foreign exchange, it has shown a reversal. However, the exchange rates posted were no different from the changes two days ago. It wasn't until 2:30 PM that only Hong Kong changed by 5 cents, to 78 taels and 5 cents. The price of banks' inflows and outflows was loose early in the morning, and slightly firm afterwards. In the afternoon, it was stable and then declined. The gold price then plunged by more than 20 taels. The confusion in the market was extremely difficult to predict. Such a major change occurred during this major closing period, which is incomprehensible. Therefore, as a result, various exchanges compared to the previous day showed British silver gaining two five, British silver gaining half a dollar, and Japanese gold falling by 分75. Chinese speculators who were套头者 largely sold, and then抵进条子. The total number of British silver was about more than three hundred thousand pounds. The appetite of the banks was still not bad. In the previous market, such as Shanghai,麦行,华比,汇丰,安达,三井, and others all have进. In the after market,华比,浙江,实业,正金,三井,三菱 and others also all bought.进安达,麦行 slightly had to sell and the various lines mutual deal ten million pound, and the American gold has few 对做Japanese gold transaction sparse Weida Lian bang, etc. sell now Dalian 100 10000元, from 止金Taiwan 住友Korea etc. Bought, the 間有三井Korea little to selling hearing large company and Shanghai is cheaper,</p>

<h3>Canceling Obstructions to Trade and Following Old Regulations</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview:  Currently, the silver dollar market is quiet due to few transactions. Generally, the market is dull, so there are no major events to record. However, because the period for settling accounts is approaching for both the silver and money industries, the final procedures are unusually troublesome, making collections and settlements particularly busy and the situation quite complicated.</p>
<p>▲Exchange Rates:  The opening exchange rate for silver dollars was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li. The afternoon rate was 7 qian 2 fen 0 hao 8 hu 7 hu ban.  The final rate was 2 hao ban lower than the bullish rate of the previous day (silver exchange rate). White loaning continued from the previous day. The morning and afternoon rates were both white loans with no interest. No extra money was added to the initial amount.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions:  Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 6 qian 7 fen 8 li in both the morning and afternoon, exactly the same as the previous day.

Copper coins were reduced by 7,000 to 342,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Yesterday, banks received and settled over 1.5 million in Hua Shang settlement bills, 2.56 million in foreign settlement bills, approximately 8 million in various commodity exchange taxes and other fees, over 4 million in settlement payments, 2 to 3 million in special funds and deposits, and 1.3 million withdrawn from the warehouse.

Over 1.8 million in foreign exchange settlements were made between foreign accounts at banks, and over 1.9 million in banknotes flowed in and out. Money shops and foreign firms received and settled over 4.8 million in single foreign currency receipts, over 2.2 million in foreign currency initial payment funds, and over 1.4 million in foreign currency loans.</p>
<h3>Securities - Bond Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction volume of various bonds in the local market totaled 62,000 yuan in spot transactions, including 34,000 yuan for First Customs bonds and 25,000 yuan for troop disbandment bonds. Other bonds were transacted at low volumes. The futures market remained stable. Market buying and selling were not quiet. The total volume for the morning and afternoon sessions combined was approximately 7 million yuan. The 20-year cigarette bonds and troop disbandment bonds were more active, reaching 1.6 to 1.7 million each. Reorganization and the 1910 and 1919 Customs bonds each reached over 800,000 yuan. Other bonds remained relatively stable. The supply and demand situation of various bonds was more balanced than before. Large investors remained in a wait-and-see attitude with no major buying or selling, so bond prices tended to be stable, fluctuating by only a few jiao in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The fluctuations were minimal compared to the previous day's mixed gains and losses. However, two-month financial bonds fell back by 8 jiao.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn - Yarn Market More Moderate</h3>
<p>The yarn market felt somewhat calm and confidence remained steady. Buyer attitudes were still firm. Fortunately, after an additional 20 taels of special margin were added, it was difficult for ordinary retail investors to make new transactions, so market conditions were more moderate. However, spot yarn business became increasingly quiet. Each group was only in the process of settling accounts, without any enthusiasm. Currently, most people think the exchange rate is high and their ambitions have reached their peak.</p>
<p>▲More New Human Bids, Gradually Fewer:  The market opened with flat sentiment. Later, due to retail investors settling accounts and a lack of new buyers, the results were four, five, and six qian to one liang five or six qian for each route. In the afternoon, market conditions became tense again. Some bulls in the one-three market closed out positions, and the market turned looser. Each month fell by three, four, five, six, or nine qian to one liang. Total transaction volume for the day was 25,150 bales. Records show that Mei Ji sold 1,250 bales, Mingde 1,050 bales, Tianlong 1,150 bales, Yi Chang 1,300 bales, and Xin Cheng 1,350 bales. Geng Feng bought 1,650 bales, Shen Chang 1,400 bales, and Chang Feng 800 bales. Closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>| July 1704 | 713,850 |</p>
<p>▲Only 600 Bales Sold on Spot Market:  Spot yarn trading remained slow. Statistics show that all groups purchased a total of 600 bales for the day. Among domestic firms, 50 bales were imported, and the market price fell slightly. Among customer firms, 80 bales were imported from inland China, 20 bales from Hong Kong, 10 bales from Jiangxi, 50 bales from Shantou, 160 bales from Guangdong, 190 bales from Yunnan, and 10 bales from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>Since an additional 10 taels of special margin were added to the cotton market, conditions have felt slightly more relaxed. Due to insufficient funds, it is difficult for retail investors to buy, so transactions have decreased and market conditions have become flat. However, buyer attitudes are still pulling tightly. Because foreign exchange rates are not loose and imported foreign cotton is still difficult to import at a reasonable price, bullish intentions are still strong. However, some manufacturers are selling. The future development depends on the shift in foreign exchange.</p>
<p>▲Many Han Bids Closing Positions:  The Han bid market opened with tight sentiment due to the residual effects of the previous day. By the second and third rounds, because American cotton was flat and Indian cotton fell slightly, each month fell by three or four qian. In the afternoon, due to some bulls closing positions, each fell by four or six qian. Total transaction volume for the day was 75,400 dan. Records show that Yu Da sold 8,000 dan, Mingde 5,500 dan, Hengde 4,800 dan, and Xin Cheng 5,400 dan. Shen Chang bought 11,200 dan, Chang Feng 3,300 dan, Geng Feng 3,800 dan, and Xin Heng 3,400 dan. Closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲Spot Demand Ordinary, Not Advancing:  Spot cotton trading was flat. There was no business today, but some trading opened up yesterday. The supplementary record is now given. The source was 500 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 41.00 Dong Mian Hang imported 400 pieces and sent them to the packaging factory in February and March.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 42.7 Ri Hua Factory imported 1,000 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 43.25 Shanghai Factory imported 1,000 pieces and sent them to the factory.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton and Yarn Slightly Rebound</h3>
<p>▲Stable American Cotton Situation:  Yesterday, American cotton was initially sluggish due to unfavorable news from Liverpool.  Then, it was strong due to the power of Wall Street.  Finally, it softened again due to some bulls closing positions.  The near-term fell by 1 to 1 pound sterling, and the long-term rose by 1 to 3 pounds sterling.  Spot prices were unchanged.  English cotton futures fell by 2-3 points, and spot prices fell by 2 points.  Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged.  Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but then became even more sluggish due to profit-taking.  Pingguoer near-term and long-term fell by 4 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi near-term and long-term both fell by 5 rupees.  The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th electric).</p>

<h3>Grains - He Xia Rice Market Tightens</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, more than twenty sources arrived in Lili Road. Sales turned brisk because a few stores needed to build up inventory. Some cargo owners planned to sell it after settlement. As a result, the market became more active. North China white japonica rice and glutinous rice were bid up by one jiao. Special top-quality japonica rice was scarce and even more beautiful. Sheep japonica rice sales were strong and arrivals were weak, and the price also rose by nearly one chi. Du Jian and Bu Jian rice were stable. Demand from various parties was not smooth and there were few high-quality goods, so there were few transactions. The arrival of Bianyin Yuanlai rice continued. Wine sales were mediocre and retail sales were good, so prices were slightly firm. It is heard here that a plan to stop measuring in dou will be implemented from the 14th, so trading in both markets is turning brisk.</p>
<p>▲Hu Nan: Yesterday, there were not many arrivals from inland China. Sales on this street were uneven. Changxi japonica rice was particularly high-quality, so top-quality rice was welcomed by buyers. Ordinary medium-quality rice prices were stable. Su Tong white japonica rice sold well. Retail and village sales inquiries were good, and prices were firm by one jiao. South China glutinous rice arrivals and sales were balanced and prices were high and firm. Sheep japonica rice market conditions were brisk because inventory and arrivals were thin and Jiangsu customer rice was in demand by customer groups, so it was slightly affected and prices gradually became tight. Bianyuan Yinhua prices were slightly higher for those greedy to buy and more than half a chi above for those with less appetite.</p>
<h3>Over 100,000 Bales of Customer Rice in Inventory</h3>
<p>▲Mostly Jiangxi Late Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer japonica rice market was even more quiet because according to custom, sales must be stopped on the day of sending off the stove god in order to wait for settlement, so local customers did not inquire. Arrivals were also weak. Even if there were arrivals, samples were not shown because the market has been poor this year. Samples will be shown and sold by main dealers in the old red market. The inventory is less than in previous years, but including the goods stored by hoarders and customer groups that have not been packed, as well as newly arrived goods from customer groups, the total number is still more than 100,000. The total number of stored goods is attached below (unit: thousands).</p>
<p>| Goods Type | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| Hunan Jing Rice | 530 bales |</p>
<p>| Jiangxi Late Rice | 3,000 bales |</p>
<p>| Hunan Ji You Rice | 3,700 bales |</p>
<p>| Jiangxi Early Rice | 11,058 bales |</p>
<p>| Hunan Ji Yuan Rice | 4,000 bales |</p>

<p>| Hunan Ji Jing Rice | 7,200 bales |</p>
<p>| Nanjing Brown Rice | 9,000 bales |</p>
<h3>Flour Market Wavering and Unstable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in both the upper and lower markets, prices for each month saw an unstable situation. After the morning opening, because gold prices were still high and overseas wheat telegrams rose by six or seven jiao, some shorts were panicked and rushed to buy near-term and long-term contracts, each rising by two or three fen. Market sentiment was very strong, and it seemed that there would be a continuation of the gains from the previous day, but once prices rose, most of the floating bulls and inland bulls sold out in droves to take profits, so the market saw a reaction. The current month fell by a small amount of three fen, the next month fell by a small amount of four or five fen, and the long-term contracts all followed suit. Later, cotton yarn firms took the opportunity to actively enter the market, and the market was up again, but by the late period, gold prices fell slightly, so the July closing price fell by a small amount of two fen. February had no changes, the next month fell by a small amount of 7.5, April fell by a small amount of 1.75, May fell by a small amount of 1.5, and June fell by a small amount of 0.5.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Gradually Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in both the upper and lower markets, each month saw a gradual loosening. Although overseas wheat was reported to have risen, cotton yarn firms did not continue to enter the market. Most of the floating bulls and inland buyers closed out positions before settlement because prices were sufficient, so they sold in large quantities, and the downstream followed. At the closing, the current month fell by a small amount of two fen, the next month fell by a small amount of two fen, April fell by a small amount of two fen, May fell by a small amount of five fen, June fell by a small amount of two fen, July fell by a small amount of four fen. There was little inflow and outflow of spot wheat, and the inventory was about 10,000 bales, mainly from the Yangtze River and Jiangbei routes. Train goods accounted for a small minority.</p>
<h3>Standard Yellow Soybeans and Bean Cakes Suddenly Plunge</h3>
<p>▲Market Closed for Settlement Starting Today</p>
<p>▲Yellow Soybeans:  Yesterday, soybean trading was good because both buyers and sellers were mostly closing positions. Because the exchange will be closed for settlement starting today, customer groups closed out most positions except for those preparing to collect cash. In addition, the Dalian telegram suddenly fell, the gold market reported weakness, and a few people who had made large profits due to the soaring soybean prices closed out their positions, so selling pressure was strong throughout the day. The current month fell slightly due to some covering transactions, but the long-term contracts fell to the same level as the closing price at the end of last week. The previous day's rise had a tendency to be artificially inflated. This kind of large rise and large fall is really rare and truly an unexpected change. The closing results were: February fell by 6 fen, March fell by 9 fen, April fell by 1 qian 1 fen, and May fell by 1 qian.</p>
<p>▲Bean Cakes:  Yesterday, the bean cake market saw a sharp drop in raw materials and poor sentiment, which led to many floating bulls and new shorts selling in the morning and afternoon sessions. However, according to observations of the market sentiment on the previous day, there was a strong upward trend, so the morning opening still carried the residual momentum of the previous day and moved steadily. However, Dalian customer groups and foreign firms suddenly dumped large quantities, causing the market to fall with the general trend. At the closing, March and June both fell by 2 fen 2 li 5 hao, April fell by 3 fen, and May fell by 3 fen 5 hao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - The Sugar Market Nearing the End of the Period</h3>
<p>▲Transactions... Market Sentiment Strong... Trend Gradually Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegrams showed that the price of Cuban spot sugar had not changed, and the prices of New York sugar futures in March and May each fell by 3 points, while September and December each fell by 2 points. The prices of Java spot and futures sugar were also unchanged. The Public Association market, as the end of the period approached, trading gradually became quiet, but market sentiment was quite strong and had a tendency to gradually rise. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was 11 liang 4 qian, and the market form was stable and inquiries were few. There were few transactions of Japanese sugar. N Mark was 12 liang 4 qian 5 fen, TK Mark was 12 liang 4 qian, Minghua YT Mark was 11 liang 2 qian 7 fen 5 hao to 11 liang 2 qian. P Mark was 11 liang 6 qian, YPO Mark was 10 liang 09 qian, and the market picture was still good. The remaining markets were quiet.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Factory Filature in High Demand</h3>
<p>The filature silk market is trending firmly because only 30-40% of silk factories in Shanghai are open, and only about 30 factories in Wuxi are operating. The production of filature silk is limited, while demand is still high, so supply cannot meet demand and prices are trending higher. Yesterday, Xin Fu imported 25 dan of superior filature silk, and the price had already risen to 194 liang.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Increasingly Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various European firms' attitudes were negative because the telegrams sent last week had not been forwarded, and there were no transactions of Zhenmei pearl tea, etc. The entire market only saw Tongfu Foreign Firm buying 93 boxes of needle-shaped green tea, and the selling price was from 25 liang to 33 liang, with little change from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Various Industry Tax Research Association Received Letters and Telegrams Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Various Industry Tax Research Association of this city, which telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments that the amount of business tax in each province should be based on the loss of the 25% surtax on land tax in each province, received the following letters and telegrams yesterday: (1) The letter from the National Government Civil Affairs Office stated, "Dear Sir, the President's Office forwarded your association's telegram regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Government's business tax, which should be limited to 1.4 million, and requested special consideration. The President has instructed the Executive Yuan, etc., so we are forwarding this letter for your information." (2) The telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government stated, "To the Various Industry Trade Association Tax Research Committee of Shanghai, we have received your telegram, and the Department of Finance has been ordered to investigate and handle it. Special reply, Zhejiang Provincial Government seal."</p>
<h3>Official Correspondence Regarding Business Taxes by Various Industries</h3>
<p>▲Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Requests Tax Exemption</p>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association sent a telegram yesterday to the National Government Council and Ministries, addressed to President Hu of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, Minister of Finance Song, and Minister of Industry Kong, saying: "We respectfully note that the Finance Ministry's resolution from last year's abolition of lijin (transit tax) conference stipulated the principle of 'one item, one tax.' Goods already subject to special central taxes should not be subject to business tax again, to reduce complications and avoid disturbing businesses. This law is well-intentioned and beneficial. However, we now hear that various provinces collecting business tax still include domestically produced silk fabrics. The industries of both provinces are deeply alarmed, and have come to the association to strongly appeal. Silk fabrics are already subject to special consumption tax, and cannot bear the additional burden of business tax, lest they fall back into shackles after barely escaping the lijin system. Surely the esteemed officials who care for our compatriots and cherish our resources would not bear to allow this to happen. This is our first request. Furthermore, the increased import duties were originally intended to compensate for the loss from abolishing lijin. However, we have heard that the customs report after increasing import duties shows that the increased revenue is more than sufficient to compensate. It seems unnecessary to further burden domestic goods with taxes, repeating the previous mistake. This is our second request. Therefore, after deliberation by the representatives of the silk industry associations of various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces under our association, we respectfully submit this request to the government, asking it to order the governments of various provinces to exempt the silk industry from business tax, thereby saving domestic silk and benefiting industry and commerce. We respectfully submit this telegram and request that your council and ministries investigate and implement, and await your instructions with utmost respect. This is truly beneficial for the Party. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association respectfully bows."</p>
<p>▲Silk Fabric Industry Requests Tax Reduction</p>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association sent a telegram yesterday to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government, saying: "We respectfully address the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The proposed business tax rate for silk fabrics by the provincial governments is excessively high, not only placing an unbearable burden on merchants but also posing the greatest obstacle to promoting domestically produced silk fabrics. The association's members have dispatched representatives to the central and provincial governments to plead their case and express their grievances, which have been sympathetically received. We now hear that Zhejiang province intends to implement a uniform tax across the province starting March 1st, and Jiangsu province will likely follow soon. However, we have not yet received clear instructions regarding the reduction of silk fabric tax rates. Merchants are alarmed and eagerly await your response. Therefore, the association has again decided to telegraph your governments, urging you to consider the livelihood of the people, heed the concerns of businesses, recognize that silk fabrics are daily necessities for the people, and that the silk industry is the source of livelihood for farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. All business tax rates should adhere to the guidelines issued by the ministry, not exceeding two per thousand, and should be levied on the business itself, not based on the type of goods, to avoid excessive disruption. We earnestly request that your governments make a timely decision and promptly issue clear instructions to reassure the anxious and prevent further anticipation. The Preparatory Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association respectfully bows, Ash."</p>
<p>▲Seafood Industry Requests Tax Reduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Seafood and Sundries Trade Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, saying: "Respectfully, we have examined the regulations promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the collection of business tax. The tax rates all exceed those stipulated by the ministry, in some cases by more than ten times. Moreover, there are errors and misunderstandings. For example, our industry, which is entirely the seafood and sundries industry, is labeled with 'ginseng and bird's nest,' and is classified as a luxury item, taxed at ten per thousand. Ginseng and bird's nest are in the ginseng and bird's nest industry, and seafood and sundries are in the seafood and sundries industry. They are clearly distinct and cannot be equated. Furthermore, the goods we deal in, except for shark fins which are slightly expensive, are all ordinary food items, and many are necessities for the poor. For example, seaweed and kelp, vegetable reds, jellyfish skin, glass noodles, arrowroot powder, dried fish, and sago rice, cost only four or five taels to eight or nine taels per dan, and are mostly sold to poor households in the north and south. If these are classified as luxury items and subjected to the same heavy tax, at a time when the poor are losing their jobs and struggling to survive, our industry will hardly survive, and the common people will be in an even more precarious situation. The above only addresses one aspect of the error. As for the meaning of business tax, it was originally intended to compensate for the cost of local administration after the abolition of lijin. Since this city has not suffered losses from the abolition of lijin, it should not follow the example of other provinces and increase the burden on the people. Moreover, the ministerial regulations stipulate that business tax, regardless of the item, should not exceed two per thousand, and there is no classification by category. How can the Jiangsu Provincial Government disregard this and disregard the authority of the central government, and violate the central government's intention to eliminate malpractices and benefit our people? Our industry is deeply concerned about its survival and has no choice but to appeal to your association to forward this to the central government and the ministries, urging the Jiangsu Provincial Government to revise the regulations and allow the business tax to be collected according to the ministry's regulations, regardless of the industry, generally at a rate of one per thousand or less, to alleviate the difficulties of businesses by relying on government orders. This would be truly beneficial for all."</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Exempting the Book Industry from Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲City Chamber of Commerce Receives Reply from Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce previously received a petition from the Book Industry Association, requesting exemption from business tax due to the book industry's relationship with culture. After forwarding the telegram to the Ministry of Finance, it received the following reply from the Ministry of Finance: "To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, we have received your telegram. We have investigated this case and found that the association previously submitted a petition directly to the ministry, which was批示 (approved/commented): 'We have reviewed the recent Administrative Yuan approved general guidelines for provincial business taxes and supplementary measures. The shops that should be exempt from business tax are limited to those that have already paid income tax or special taxes to the central government, as well as banks and special companies. The book industry belongs to the printing and publishing industry, and its business tax should be collected according to regulations. The request to issue a notice to exempt all provinces is difficult to approve,' etc., printed and filed. You are hereby notified, Finance Ministry Seal."</p>
<h3>Ministry's Response to Request for Supporting the Cigarette Industry</h3>
<p>▲Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce's telegram, which pleaded for permission to allocate bonuses from the collection of the consolidated cigarette tax, in accordance with the reward and protection measures stipulated in the general guidelines for special consumption taxes, to support the cigarette industry. The reply stated that according to the telegram from漾日, and the telegram of the same date from the Administrative Yuan to the chamber of commerce regarding the same matter, "We have investigated and found that cigarettes are a luxury item and not an item that must be rewarded and protected. Furthermore, the revenue from this consolidated tax has been designated by the National Government as a fund for issuing treasury bonds, which concerns the credit of national debt and should not be used arbitrarily. The request to allocate reward bonuses is difficult to approve. You are hereby notified." This is the reply.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Discussion Committee to Hold Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>▲Tang Liu Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Singapore</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Discussion Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will hold its 34th regular meeting on the 12th. It is reported that the agenda includes a draft proposal to be submitted to the ministry regarding the water supply issue in the public concession, as well as proposals to request the authorities to actively prepare for passport checks for foreigners entering the country, and other important cases. In addition, Mr. Tang Liu, former Consul-General in Singapore and a member of the committee, who recently returned to the country, will report on the situation of overseas Chinese in Singapore.</p>
<h3>Protecting the Public's Payment of Grain Tax</h3>
<p>▲Police Protection Assigned by City and County</p>
<p>Since the division of Shanghai City and County, the grain counters for collecting busy cao grain tax remain next to the county government. Now, the city's Land Bureau believes that the current period is the peak season for the people to pay the winter grain tax, and the next few days will be particularly busy. Fearing that bandits might seize the opportunity to rob the counters, in addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the relevant second district and second precinct to dispatch police to protect the counters in shifts, the county Public Security Bureau chief police will also assist in the protection.</p>
<h3>Overcrowding for Exchanging Housing Tax for City Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲Request to Add Staff at the Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The municipal government previously borrowed housing tax for its use. Starting this month, it began exchanging it for 19-year customs treasury bonds and city public bonds, which has been announced in the newspaper. It is reported that recently, there has been extreme overcrowding for exchanging these treasury bonds. Those holding tickets have even had to wait from morning to night without receiving a notification. It is expected that someone will send a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau, requesting that it find a way to add staff to handle this matter, to avoid wasting time and facilitate convenience.</p>
<h3>National Treasury Has No Funds to Subsidize the Decline of Sichuan Silk</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders the National Federation of Commerce to Take Note</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: "For your information, we have received a consultation from the Ministry of Finance, stating that it has received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, stating that President Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) of the National Government has assigned the National Federation of Commerce's report on the decline of Sichuan silk, requesting the allocation of funds for relief and asking for tax exemptions to maintain it, to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. Although the current treasury funds are tight, Sichuan silk urgently needs to be maintained, which is also a real situation concerning finance. We are consulting you for review and reply. We have approved this consultation. If we are capable, we should allocate funds for relief. However, the national treasury currently has no funds for subsidies. We hereby reply for your information," etc. We have approved this. In the past, the association came to report and the Executive Yuan assigned it to our ministry, which was then consulted with the Ministry of Finance. With the approval of the previous consultation, we will now issue an order for your information, etc. The National Federation of Commerce has already informed the Sichuan silk merchant representative Li Kui'an and others to take note.</p>

<p>▲Yichang Wheel Towed to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Yichang Maru wheel of the Jiangda Company on the Yangtze River encountered fog and ran aground at Yaojiagang, Tongzhou. The ship's horn was damaged, and the cargo hold was flooded. Passengers transferred to another wheel to Shanghai. The newspaper reported on this. The company sent the Jardine Matheson Victoria wheel to tow it, and it was towed to Wusong at 2:50 p.m. yesterday. It then drove into Shanghai and stopped at Hongkou. First, unload the cargo, and then enter the dock for major repairs.</p>
<p>▲Jiangda Rescue Again</p>
<p>Taigoo barge hit Jiangda's bow. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent six ironworkers to Dashengguan to tighten the two wheel bows that were broken, so as to be towed to Shanghai for repairs. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received another telegram from Jiangda, saying that the Tunan wheel had been waiting at the mouth of Wujiang twice yesterday for the ironworkers to remove the barge, and then towed it to Shanghai for major repairs to the damaged keel and broken bow cabin in the factory.</p>
<p>▲Inland Wheels Stop Running</p>
<p>The old customs of the local inland shipping bureau cannot be avoided at the end of the lunar year. The export goods of various Shanghai merchants to various inland villages will be suspended from loading and unloading from the 7th and 8th of this month. This is because the Hakkas are closing their accounts and will no longer be in business. Inland small wheels, such as those on the Suzhou, Hangzhou, Xichang, and Hu lines, except for the China Merchants Bureau wheel, which is under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, abide by the new calendar and are not allowed to stop navigation. Other commercially operated small wheels will have their last schedule today and will all stop running tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Pacific American Wheel Expansion</h3>
<p>▲Weihai Wheel Also Allowed to Join the Association</p>
<p>Wheel companies are competing to build new ships for the Pacific route and are doing their best to seek development in China. Japan Post, Changxing, etc. have built new wheels and entered the Sino-American line. The voyage speed has increased, and the amount of ship load has increased. The sea route has been shortened, and the faster the better. Now, the American merchant Dalai Ocean Bank has specially built two new wheels with 16 million US dollars and joined the Pacific Ocean. It can be opened in August and September of this year. The bank must add to the voyage due to business expansion. The method will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Add Panama Shuttle</p>
<p>The bank's Pacific wheel has two original lines, one to San Francisco and one to Seattle. After arriving in Shanghai, the two postal ships exchanged voyages, hence the name horseshoe route. This year, due to the completion of the new giant wheel, and the addition of three ships, the Longtian, Asami, and Chichibu, in the San Francisco class, the business has inevitably diminished. Lao Dalai decided to extend the sea voyage of the five Pacific postal ships to San Francisco and add the Panama to New York class. This can save the transportation of goods from Shanghai to the United States from the transfer of trains in San Francisco and pay huge freight charges. The president wheels, such as Cleveland, Bias, Huierxun, and Grant, which traveled between Jinshan and Shanghai, will start operating this new route from Panama to New York, starting with the Jackson wheel leaving Shanghai on April 3. It only takes 35 days from Shanghai to New York. Hu Xing has changed the schedule yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Two New Giant Wheels Added</p>
<p>The newly built Hoover and Coolidge, two president wheels, each with 33,800 tons of displacement, are unprecedented giant wheels in the Pacific Ocean. It has also been agreed that when the two new ships open in August and October of this year, they will also be assigned to this San Francisco to New York direct flight, so that the transportation of Chinese silk and tea to the United States can be spared the trouble of sea and land transit. It only takes 31 days to arrive. The ship is equipped with airplanes to pick up passengers, and there are cars that can go directly to the ship. It is the newest style postal ship in the Far East.</p>
<p>▲Expand the World Shuttle</p>
<p>The bank's World Shuttle originally had seven ships. Later, due to the addition of the Qiangsheng Wheel, the Hays and Monroe President Wheels were changed to the Singapore to New York line. Now, the Singapore side has expanded its ships to seven due to the start of business. When the Pacific wheel is greatly expanded, it is decided to add two more ships to the World Wheel, that is, the Hays and Monroe ships will be withdrawn from Nanyang and added to the World Road. In the future, there will be one wheel leaving the Pacific Ocean every day, and one ship will depart from the World Line every fourteen days.</p>
<p>▲Weihai Ship Joins the Association</p>
<p>Last year, the Weihai wheels of Shunheng and Tianjin, two banks in the Sino-American class, had a total of eleven ships, all of which were newly added to the Pacific Ocean, and competed with British, Japanese, and American merchants in the Far East shipping industry, resulting in a drop in water feet and a mess in freight rates. As a result, both sides were damaged. Now, after the British, Japanese, and American wheel companies consulted with the Weihai shipping company, they persuaded it to join the association and stop abusing the rate of decline. The Weihai Wheel Company has accepted and will be allowed to join the Pacific Water Foot Association starting next month and can open and load Huasi for export.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Opium Monopoly</h3>
<p>▲Expressing Complete Resistance</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the tobacco control authorities have adopted an opium monopoly plan. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has collected reports from all parties and sent a letter to the authorities for attention. The details have been recorded in the previous report. It is reported that public groups in various places have paid special attention to the rumors of the opium monopoly. For example, the Chinese Medical Association and the Taxpayer Chinese Association in this city have sent letters to the association expressing their unanimous opposition and striving to achieve a thorough policy of prohibition. In addition, the Shanghai Christian Preaching Federation also sent a letter to the association, stating that through the standing committee of the Preaching Federation, the whole body unanimously advocated the thorough implementation of the complete prohibition policy and opposed the malpractices of monopoly. A meeting of all Christians will be called to resist. Other groups, such as the Zhejiang National Anti-Drug Branch, the Tianjin National Anti-Drug Branch Preparatory Office, the Harbin National Anti-Drug Branch, and the Fujian Poison Removal General Society, have all sent telegrams to the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association expressing their unanimous opposition, saying: (1) Opium is a public factory of public opinion. The prime minister's legacy is obvious. Opium's public sale is absolutely wrong to implement. (2) The government clearly ordered the prohibition of opium in the past, but now it sells it publicly in the future. It will surely be ridiculed by all countries. The international status and reputation will be unimaginable. How can we comfort the people and respond to the international community? (3) In addition to requesting the government to implement the prime minister's prohibition policy on the one hand and make a clear announcement to dispel doubts, we will convene a national anti-smoking conference as soon as possible to vigorously prohibit smoking. (4) Absolutely be the backing, hoping to actively oppose. It is reported that there are many other groups that have expressed unanimous opposition, and the association is collecting and publishing them one after another.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union Requests Housing Allowance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union submitted a document to the Post Office Headquarters, stating: "The document is for Shanghai's high rents and difficult living conditions. Please take into account the situation and add a housing allowance of ten yuan to provide relief and comfort the public. According to the requirements of members of various branches, Shanghai is a major trading port with the largest number of residents, and rents are several times higher than in other parts of the interior. Postal workers who serve in Shanghai are mostly families, and their residence is even more difficult. Rents in areas with convenient transportation are not less than dozens of yuan, and those in remote areas may be slightly cheaper, but the daily transportation costs are even more expensive. Since last year, life in Shanghai has become increasingly difficult, and housing rents have more than doubled in the past. The postal workers feel the difficulty of making a living on the one hand, and the difficulty of living on the other hand. The pain is conceivable. The capital post office has been implementing the housing allowance for postal workers for many years, and there are also housing allowances and coal allowances in Harbin and other places for Shanghai's supply service. This is to avoid our postal workers from falling into a desperate situation due to facilities in the mainland. Even postal chiefs and others who enjoy high salaries have housing allowances and other allowances. Our Shanghai postal workers have small salaries and huge expenses. It is not enough to maintain if a housing allowance is not given separately. Therefore, we respectfully request that your bureau take into account the situation and add a monthly housing allowance of ten yuan to each level of employees from postal workers and below, to provide relief and comfort the public. I respectfully request approval, promulgation and implementation. I am overwhelmed by the urgency to wait for the order." (Hua Dong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Fine Arts Workers' Dispute Mediation Successful</h3>
<p>▲Supplementary Signature Today</p>
<p>The All-Factory workers of the Jingyi Leather Factory on Yokohama Road, Zhabei, and the Baziqiao Branch requested the payment of year-end bonuses for last year. The union dispatched personnel to discuss with the factory owner Zhou Wenlin without results. They continued to demand an increase in wages of seven yuan per person per month. The capital side had previously increased wages when rice prices soared in February last year, and it has been very considerate to the capital side without reducing wages now that rice prices have eased, so it was not allowed. Later, the capital side saw that the capital side did not respond, and immediately began to work slowly from the 7th. Seeing this, the capital side submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. In order to avoid the expansion of labor tides, the bureau dispatched Wang Bing to persuade and obtain the consent of both labor and capital to determine four methods: (1) Tian factory pays 15 days of wages per person as last year's bonus. (2) All workers will immediately restore the original work. (3) During the slack period, the work will be done by the labor side. (4) The request to increase wages will be submitted by the labor side to the party and government organs for verification, and it is scheduled to be 9 a.m. today. Both labor and capital parties will send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to formally supplement the signature.</p>
<h3>Xialun Silk Factory Labor Tide Resolved</h3>
<p>▲Signing of Seven-Item Agreement</p>
<p>The workers of the Xialun Silk Weaving Factory on Nanshan Road, Zhabei, in this city, proposed to improve the treatment because the factory's treatment was not good and the working hours were as long as 15 hours. The capital side ignored it, which led to a strike by all the workers on the 28th of last month. At the same time, they requested assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau. At 1 p.m. yesterday, the bureau called for mediation of this case. Bao Jinshi and Chen Baoshu, representatives of the capital side, and Chen Zhangru and Yang Dezhou, representatives of the labor side, agreed to sign the agreement with Wang Bing as the chairman. The seven agreements are as follows: (1) The deposit foreign funds deducted by the factory will be fully released, but the labor side must find a guarantor to guarantee to the factory that if the worker leaves the factory halfway during the school year without the factory's consent, the guarantor will compensate the deposit foreign funds of 50 yuan. (2) The daily working time shall not exceed twelve hours at most. If the factory opens night work, it must first obtain the consent of the workers. (3) The period of use of electric light bulbs is limited to one month as usual. (4) There are two holidays per month, one day each time. (5) Wages will be paid one day before the holiday. (6) Workers' food, the factory must strictly injure the kitchen and must not be too bad. (7) From today, all workers must work as usual, and the chairman announced the mediation was established.</p>
<h3>Citizen Training Association Convened Graduates of Industrial Training Institute for Admonition</h3>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Fujian Drug Removal General Society, and other groups, all telegraphed the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association to express unanimous opposition, saying, in brief: (1) Opium is the public enemy of the people's will. The Prime Minister's last words are clear. The public sale of opium is absolutely wrong to implement. (2) The government clearly ordered the prohibition of opium in the past, but now it sells it publicly in the future. It will surely be ridiculed by all countries. The international status and reputation will be unimaginable. How can we comfort the people and respond to the international community? (3) In addition to requesting the government to implement the Prime Minister's prohibition policy on the one hand and make a clear announcement to dispel doubts, we will convene a national anti-smoking conference as soon as possible to vigorously prohibit smoking.

<h3>Change of Director at the Industrial Products Testing Institute</h3>
<p>▲ New Director: Dr. Shen Xiongqing</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Products Testing Institute was established by industrial expert Mr. Xu Peihuang, by order,</p>
<p>to undertake commissions from industry and commerce to solve problems, analyze difficulties, and imitate or innovate, it has been greatly praised by various industries, who have vied to make use of its services, resulting in remarkable achievements. As Mr. Xu has been appointed by the National Government as Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and is extremely busy with the administration of education in the city, he is unable to concurrently hold the position of Director of the Institute. He submitted his resignation as Director last month, which was approved by the Municipal Government. The successor has been determined to be Dr. Shen Xiongqing, the Director of the Institute. Dr. Shen is a Doctor of Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin in the United States, and has successively served as a Chemistry Professor at Shanghai's Soochow University and other institutions, and as a consultant engineer at the Commercial Press. He has extensive experience in chemical industry research, and his knowledge will greatly benefit industry and commerce. It is also said that Mr. Shen is concurrently serving as a technical specialist in the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<h3>Order Regarding the Organization of People's Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an instruction to the district chiefs yesterday, stating: To comply with the case, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department telegraphed: The Provincial Government telegraphed: The National Government forwarded a letter from the Central Association, stating: Three measures are prescribed for the reorganization or re-organization of people's associations within a limited time: (1) The deadline for the reorganization of various people's associations, except for the Farmers' Association, which will be determined after the promulgation of the Farmers' Association Law, and the Chamber of Commerce, which should be handled in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of the revised Chamber of Commerce Law as resolved by the National Government's State Council, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations, all workers' unions and social organizations must complete their reorganization by the end of January of the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931]. (2) Various people's associations that have passed the statutory deadline for reorganization but have not yet completed the reorganization should be reorganized in accordance with the organizational plan for people's associations and the relevant laws and regulations for each association. (3) Those who re-organize various people's associations must formally organize and establish them before February 15 of the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], and the Yuan [Executive Yuan] is to instruct its subordinates to comply. In addition to issuing a notice, the Provincial Party Rectification Association and the Civil Affairs and Agriculture and Mining Departments are to be informed separately. You are instructed to order your subordinates to comply and submit a list of associations that have been reorganized or need to be re-organized for review. Upon receiving this, we hereby urgently telegraph the County Magistrate to instruct the various associations under your jurisdiction to quickly instruct them to reorganize or organize separately and complete the reorganization within the specified time. Also, thoroughly investigate and fill out the attached form with the details of associations that have been reorganized or need to be re-organized in the county and submit it for compilation and forwarding. Forms will be issued to the county. Upon receiving this, in addition to investigating and reporting the various associations that have been organized in the form and sending them separately, we hereby instruct the District Chief to follow the instructions and notify the district to separately reorganize or organize in accordance with the regulations and within the specified time, and report back for review without any delay. This order is imperative.</p>
<h3>Record of the Joint Association of Guild Halls and Public Offices</h3>
<p>▲ Seven Committee Members Appointed</p>
<p>Our city's various guild halls and public offices, having seen the newspaper report that Shanghai Municipal Government Notice No. 215 requires all social organizations and charitable organizations in the city to apply for registration before March 31 in accordance with the central government's promulgated Supervisory Law for Charitable Organizations and the Social Organization Organization Procedures, otherwise they will be strictly dealt with. However, the old organizational structures and original charters of the various guild halls and public offices are largely inconsistent with current laws and regulations, and they are not very clear about the registration procedures, making progress extremely difficult. Therefore, the Joint Association of Guild Halls and Public Offices convened a meeting of its members the day before yesterday. On that day, representatives from more than 30 organizations attended, which was sufficient to meet the legal quorum. Chen Liangyu was publicly elected as chairman, and after the rituals were performed, the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting, stating that the municipal government's deadline for registration was very pressing, and each organization should prepare and proceed as soon as possible, and not delay any further. After lengthy discussions by the representatives, it was decided to publicly elect seven committee members to form a review committee to separately review the original charters of each organization and formulate standard reorganization measures so that the affiliated organizations could follow them in order to proceed with registration separately. Chen Liangyu, Guo Zhongliang, Weng Yaheng, Gao Jianqing, Chen Yiting, Cheng Qingtao, and Wu Shutian were immediately appointed as members of the review committee, and Wu Shutian was publicly elected to be responsible for convening the review meetings at 4 p.m. every Sunday afternoon in order to carry out the review. At the same time, a notice was sent to all affiliated organizations to send their original charters and old organizational overviews to the association within one week for forwarding to the review committee for verification. Those organizations that have already been approved for registration are also requested to send a copy of their charters, etc., for reference.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Resignation and Replacement of Committee Members of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>▲ Vacancies Can Be Filled by Substitute Committee Members According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a notice to all trade associations, stating: We respectfully inform you that on September 12 of last year, we received a letter from the Cotton Cloth Trade Association stating that Articles 14 and 24 of the association's charter stipulate that the resignation or retirement of committee members must be approved by a general meeting of members. However, among the elected executive committee members of this session, some are determined to resign, leading to the following questions: (1) Does the provision in the charter specifically refer to committee members after they have taken office, so that once elected, they are all bound by it? (2) The general meeting of members is held once a year according to the charter. Before the meeting is convened and passed, should the resignation of the committee member be put on hold, or should it be considered an urgent issue that requires a special meeting to be convened? If it is difficult to convene a meeting, or the quorum is not met, what remedy is available? Please provide instructions. After deliberation at the 12th regular meeting of our Chamber, it was decided that the resignation or retirement of elected personnel, regardless of whether it is stated in the charter, must be approved by the original election body according to the source of authority. However, these meetings are often difficult to convene. Therefore, as a general practice, unless the number of resigning personnel is excessive, requiring a general meeting to be convened to resolve the issue in accordance with the law, if only a small number of people apply for resignation after being elected, the majority of the elected personnel can take office first and then convene a meeting to discuss whether to approve the resignation. If the resignation is approved, the substitute member should be notified to fill the vacancy, and a report should be submitted to the competent authorities for record. This situation was communicated to the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, and the proposed measures were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. On the 6th of this month, we received Instruction No. 5859 from the Social Affairs Bureau, which stated: Regarding the case submitted by the Association, concerning the method of deciding whether the power to approve or disapprove the resignation of elected officials of trade associations should be decided, the case has been reviewed and approved. It has been reported to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Instruction No. 13607 stated: It has been found that there are clear provisions on the approval of resignations of officials of various associations, and the various measures proposed by the Association are appropriate and should be notified for compliance. However, the Association's original proposed measures included a clause on notifying substitute members to fill vacancies. The method of generating these substitute members was not specified in detail. The Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law also does not have any explicit provisions. The case was submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. Instruction No. 389 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated: The report has been received. It has been found that the method of generating substitute executive committee members of the association can be determined in accordance with Article 16 of the Implementing Rules of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, which can be used as a reference for the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, i.e., when the association elects executive committee members, it may elect substitute committee members separately, who will fill vacancies in order. As for the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply that the provisions on industry associations were not applicable to the Chamber of Commerce, this refers to Article 11 of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, which clearly stipulates the retirement of officials, and cannot be used as a reference for Article 22, Paragraph 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. It is not the case that any provisions for which there are no other regulations cannot be used as a reference for the Chamber of Commerce Law. Although Article 9 of the Association Law does not stipulate the title of substitute committee members, it is consistent with the meaning of the separate rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law. In order to facilitate the actual situation, if the association's charter stipulates the substitute committee members by itself, it is not inconsistent with the law. Based on the information presented, you are hereby notified. As the Association's proposed method of notifying substitute members to fill vacancies was submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review, it is hereby ordered that the Association be notified and that all affiliated trade associations be notified for compliance. The various labor unions often interpret the Chamber of Commerce Law on the grounds that the Association Law does not have any provisions for substitute executive committee members, and there are limitations on the application of the Chamber of Commerce Law, which causes difficulties in implementation. As a result of the aforementioned, each industry can now handle matters in accordance with these regulations. A letter is hereby issued for notification, hoping that you will all act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Record of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Physicians' Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Physicians' Association held its fifth executive committee meeting the day before yesterday, chaired by Song Guobin. The following was discussed: (1) The issue of physician registration in the French Concession: The representative reported that the French Municipal Council had adopted the Association's opinion, and that members of the Association who have not obtained a license from the Chinese government can also be issued a license if the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau provides written proof that the doctor is a member of the Shanghai Physicians' Association. Should a representative be appointed today to contact the Shanghai Municipal Health Authorities regarding the case? (Resolution) (1) As the first step, the Association's representative, Song Guobin (replaced by Chu Minyi), the Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch representative Pang Jingzhou, the Chinese Medical Society Shanghai Branch Fang Jiacheng, and the Bo Yi Hui Shanghai Branch representative Branch will meet with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau at 10 a.m. to discuss all registration issues. (2) A joint emergency meeting of the standing committees of various medical associations will be convened at 6 p.m. on the 11th to report and discuss all registration issues. (2) The Examination Yuan has announced the regulations for the higher examination for Western medicine physicians. Should the Association express its attitude?

<h3>Reference for Export Trade to France</h3>
<p>▲ The Industrial and Commercial Visitation Bureau Has a Graphic Index</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received an instruction from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: To inform the prefect, a communication was received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: The Consul General in Paris has reported that he has recently received letters from our merchants in Shanghai or Tianjin, inquiring about the situation of a certain French industrial and commercial export. The consulate's replies are often inevitably lacking in detail. It has been found that the Stendhal Printing House in Paris publishes a graphic index of French exports every year, which includes texts in French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Dutch, and is divided into categories such as food, woodware, jewelry, spices, clothing, machinery, entertainment products, and paper products. It is very detailed. Therefore, a copy has been purchased and sent to the Ministry of Industry for forwarding to the Ministry of Industry so that our merchants engaged in French import and export can directly send letters to the Ministry of Industry for inquiry. This will not only enable them to obtain all the information but also save time. Accordingly, the original graphic index is enclosed for your Ministry to check and reserve for use. The enclosed graphic index of French exports is approved. In addition to forwarding the original document to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Visitation Bureau for storage and reference, if the Association wishes to inquire about the situation of French industrial and commercial exports in the future, you may send a letter directly to the Bureau for inquiry. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Telegram Received by the Red Cross for Relief in Changge</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross received a telegram from the Henan Relief Association, which stated: To the Chinese Red Cross: It has been repeatedly reported by Tang Ji, the magistrate of Changge County, and Gao Yihao, the representative of the 25th District, that after the banditry in the county, Fan Zhongyou, Liu Guitang, Sun Shigui, Hui Yingqi, and others, totaling more than 200,000 people, stationed themselves in the territory for seven months, carrying out indiscriminate looting and exhausting all resources. According to statistics, the forced contributions of funds, firewood, and grass, converted to silver, amounted to no less than one million yuan. More than 6,000 laborers were conscripted, more than 5,000 livestock were seized, and more than 1,900 carts were taken. Countless properties were lost. In addition, there was a severe drought throughout the year, and the wheat crop withered. In addition to the deaths and displacement, there are more than 5,000 extremely poor families who cannot afford to cook. Each household is deeply suffering from banditry, drought, and war. They cannot plan for the next day. We earnestly implore you to show compassion for the survivors and bestow your benevolence to help them survive. We are deeply grateful. Zhang Fangdong of the Henan Relief Association.</p>
<h3>Defense Corps Raises Funds for Uniforms</h3>
<p>The various teams under the Shanghai Hu Nan and Zhabei District Defense Corps are lacking winter uniforms. The captains of each team have successively submitted requests to the Defense Corps Reorganization Committee for allocation, but there are no funds available for this purpose. The chairman of the Reorganization Committee has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for permission to raise funds separately to purchase winter uniforms. It is planned to print a fundraising appeal and fundraising regulations into donation booklets, which were sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations yesterday, requesting them to enthusiastically support and separately solicit donations. Once a certain amount is raised, workers will be hired to manufacture wool winter uniforms, which will be distributed to each team for the members to wear, in order to enhance their appearance.</p>
<h3>New Locomotive Passenger Cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Are Being Installed and Put into Service</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau previously found that the original locomotives were too old and lacked traction, which inevitably caused delays in train schedules. Therefore, in order to fundamentally address the problem, it purchased eight Pacific-type new locomotives from the United Kingdom. These new locomotives have been successively installed and tested, and the results have been very satisfactory. Four of them have now been allocated for use on special express trains. The remaining locomotives will be used on express trains. In the future, train delays will not occur again unless there are unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>After the new locomotives are put into service, the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai can be shortened. However, the entire line is single-track, and the old sleepers along the way are a major obstacle to increasing speed. The Railway Bureau has now begun to urgently replace the rotten sleepers. It is planned to revise the timetable from March 1. Currently, the special express train between Beijing and Shanghai takes 7 hours and 20 minutes. This will be reduced to 6 hours and 45 minutes in the future. The night special express train will depart from Beijing and Shanghai at 11:30 p.m. and arrive at the station at 7:20 a.m. When the old sleepers have been completely replaced, further shortening will be attempted. The problem of the shortage of passenger cars can also be gradually resolved. It is heard that the Wusong Factory of the Railway is now installing and putting into service two first- and second-class combined cars and five third-class cars from among the newly arrived passenger cars. After they have been completely manufactured, these new passenger cars will be formed into two special express trains running between Beijing and Shanghai in order to facilitate travel.</p>

It is heard that the country will hold a welcome reception for the new members at a certain stage in March or April, where the achievements of each group will be presented, and Ms. Xu Shuzhen will be invited to present the awards. Preparations are currently underway, and it is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Grand Dinner Dance to be Held by Rotary Club</h3>
<p>The local Rotary Club is scheduled to hold a grand dinner dance on Thursday, the 12th, at the Grand Cathay Ballroom.  A similar event was previously held, and it is expected that this time will be even better.  A few months ago, the club raised funds for the Russian Children's School, and the dance raised over 17,000 yuan, with excellent results. This dinner dance will be nothing short of an international celebration, with a diverse program including Chinese opera, American singing, British drama, Bavarian dance, Japanese dance, and more, each with its own unique and wonderful characteristics.  Performances will be given in succession to showcase the artistic expertise of each country, adding special interest and making it worthy of contemplation, truly enhancing the event.  Since the venue is the Grand Cathay Ballroom, only a slight decoration is needed to make it ready. The organizing committee has decided to decorate the hall with the flags of the 70 nationalities of the members, and the club's logo will be placed on the stage.  The committee members responsible for the program include Mr. and Mrs. White from the United States, Mr. and Mrs. Callan from Australia, Mrs. Hawkins and Mrs. Madden from England, Mr. Guo Biao from China, Mr. and Mrs. Shan Tao from Czechoslovakia, Mr. Insuli from France, Mr. Scheffler from Germany, Mr. Woolf from Ireland, Mr. and Mrs. Pace from Italy, Mr. Yoyatani from Japan, and Mr. Gordon from Scotland.

<h3>Good News for Creditors of the Rising Sun Bank</h3>
<p>▲Hot Spring Bathhouse and Others in Contact for Sale</p>
<p>▲Partial Debt Repayment as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Rising Sun Bank and the Da Shi Jie (Great World) Savings Department are still being liquidated by accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang. This reporter interviewed accountant Wu yesterday, who said that in terms of the various assets, if they can be properly disposed of, creditors can hopefully avoid losses, but it is only a matter of time before they can be repaid. The first step is to sell the branch locations of the Rising Sun Bank on Zhejiang Road and Sichuan Road. The Hot Spring Bathhouse and other properties are also in the process of being sold. Today (i.e., yesterday), letters have been sent to urge the repayment of debts, and the funds received will be deposited in reliable banks to repay the principal of savings deposits and current deposits as soon as possible within the year. The next step is to repay the principal of fixed deposits and current account deposits, and finally to clear the interest. Regarding the private assets of Huang Chujiu, an agreement has been reached with lawyer Tan Yigong to publicly discuss the disposal method or repay in installments after the registration is completed within two weeks. Currently, the Rising Sun Bank head office has retained eight original staff members to be responsible for handling affairs, and the branches have retained about three people each, as is the case with the Great World Savings Department, in order to save money. This reporter also interviewed lawyer Tan Yigong yesterday, who expressed great dissatisfaction with the disunity and chaotic opinions of the creditor group. He also said that Huang's private assets are sufficient to cover the debts. After the cleaning and registration are completed within two weeks, the details will be fully disclosed to the press, so creditors can rest assured.</p>
<h3>The Sensational "Daredevil" Case Ends</h3>
<p>▲Hong Shen Withdraws Lawsuit Yesterday</p>
<p>Last spring, the Grand Cathay Cinema screened the film "Daredevil" starring American Rock, the content of which was extremely insulting to the Chinese people. Hong Shen, a professor at Fudan University, went to see it and was filled with righteous indignation. He gave a speech on stage in front of the audience, causing the audience to return their tickets in droves. Gao Yongqing, the manager of the cinema, accused Hong of disrupting order and had him arrested and detained in the Xinzha Police Station, but he was soon released. In addition to reporting the matter to the central government through the municipal party headquarters to lodge a protest with the United States to ban the film, Hong also hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Wu Chengyu to sue Gao Yongqing in the former Provisional Court. After a trial, the Provisional Court was reorganized and the case was transferred to the Special District Local Court. Later, summonses were issued, but because there was hope for a settlement, it was temporarily suspended for nearly ten months. The news subsided, and the public's enthusiasm for the matter waned as time passed. Moreover, it was rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had reached a satisfactory result in its negotiations with the United States, so the matter was largely forgotten. However, the Special Court suddenly issued a summons yesterday afternoon, and few people outside knew about it, so at 2:00 PM, the audience seats were empty, far from the grandeur of the previous trial. Even the defendant was not present. Only the plaintiff, Hong Shen, and his lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, arrived at the court on time. Judge Zhou Baiming took his seat, and lawyer Zhan stood up and applied to withdraw the lawsuit, saying that the case had now been resolved peacefully outside the court. Hong Shen's purpose in filing the lawsuit was to ban the screening of the film and to have the defendant publish an apology to the plaintiff in the newspaper and donate a large sum of 5,000 gold dollars to the school. Now that all of these goals have been achieved, there is no personal interest involved, and the party headquarters has already taken appropriate action. He requested that the court grant the withdrawal of the lawsuit in order to bring an end to the matter. Judge Zhou approved the request and dismissed the case, thus ending this sensational and protracted case.</p>
<h3>The Gatekeeper of Lin Weiqing's House Was Indeed in Collusion with Kidnappers</h3>
<p>▲Secret Meeting at the Tiannan Hotel Beforehand</p>
<p>▲Reporting the Owner's Time of Arrival and Departure</p>
<p>Lin Weiqing, a Cantonese contractor residing at 55 Baker Road, returned to his residence at 1:10 AM the day before yesterday with his wife and daughter in his own car. As they arrived at the gate, the gatekeeper was slow to open the gate, which allowed kidnappers who were lying in wait to seize the opportunity. Lin, being alert, drove the car into the house, but his wife and daughter were taken away. The car suddenly stopped midway, and the kidnappers were unable to escape together. Lin's wife and daughter were fortunate to return home. They reported to the police station that the gatekeeper was suspected. The details of the investigation have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Lin Weiqing is the brother of Lin Biao, the current president of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The gatekeeper he hired, named Wang JiaKui, is from Shandong. According to the police investigation, he was indeed involved in collusion with the bandits. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Xiao. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the defendant Wang JiaKui has confessed to the police that on the 1st and 2nd of this month, he and his accomplices secretly met at the Tiannan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to inform his accomplices of the time his master entered and left the house. The day before yesterday, the bandits were lying in ambush near Lin's house. Lin's driver honked the horn of the car frequently from a distance of several tens of paces from the residence, but the defendant pretended not to hear. It is believed that the defendant harbored this malicious intent because his request to his employer for a wage increase was denied. Lin Weiqing then arrived in court to testify that he had hired Wang as a gatekeeper for over a year, with a monthly salary of 18 yuan, which, together with additional income, amounted to about 24 gold dollars per month. He did not notice any bad behavior on his part in the past. The night before yesterday, he returned home with his wife and daughter from his relatives' house. As the car arrived in front of the gate, he honked the horn repeatedly, but the defendant delayed opening the gate, causing four bandits to rush out from the west. One of them held a pistol and used the butt of the gun to smash the car window glass. He realized that they were not good people and got out of the car and ran into the house first, pushing one of the bandits down. His wife and daughter were then kidnapped, but they soon returned together. After careful consideration, he suspected the defendant. He questioned the defendant, who claimed that he was slow to open the door because of a foot ailment and that he needed to find the key. Someone invited him to the Tiannan Hotel to inquire about the owner's whereabouts, intending to carry out a kidnapping, and asked him to join their party, but he did not agree, and so on. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Switch to Female Stewards</h3>
<p>▲A Clever Plan to Compete in the Shipping Industry</p>

It has decided to recruit 200 women first, aged between 25 and 30 years old. The internship period is one year, after which they will be assigned to serve on various ships, with a salary of 60 taels per month. It is said that recruitment will begin on March 1st.</p>
<h3>A Sand Boat Outside Wusongkou is Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>▲Another Sand Boat Luckily Escaped Due to Favorable Winds</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a northern sand boat entered the port. According to the boat crew, at about 4 PM the day before yesterday, the boat was sailing through the Tongsha waters outside Wusongkou. At the same time, two other sand boats were sailing behind them. Suddenly, five bandit boats appeared on the sea, rushed towards the boat, and fired shots to intimidate them, hoping to rob them. Fortunately, the northeast wind was very strong at the time, and the boat crew noticed this, quickly raised the sails, and sailed quickly with the wind, thus avoiding being caught up by the bandit boats and escaping danger. However, seeing the previous boat escape, the bandits quickly surrounded the two sand boats behind them. The two boats seemed not to have noticed beforehand, so they could not escape. After the boat sailed away from the bandit boats, they saw the two sand boats behind them surrounded by bandit boats from a distance, and they heard intermittent gunfire. It is likely that the two sand boats had self-defense weapons on board and resisted the bandit boats in the face of danger. Later, the boat sailed further away and no longer heard gunfire. The boat entered the port yesterday morning, but the two sand boats were not seen by noon. It is thought that they have all been robbed by the bandit boats.</p>
<h3>Douglas Fairbanks Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Tea Party at the Cathay Hotel This Afternoon</p>
<p>▲Leaves Shanghai Southbound at 6:00 PM Tonight</p>
<p>The Belgenland, a Red Star Line ship, arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao carrying 350 people on a world tour. The American movie star Douglas Fairbanks also traveled south on the ship. He landed at the Customs Wharf at 9:15 PM last night. Those who came to welcome him included Mr. Fairbanks' friends and his Shanghai representative, lawyer Grass. Mr. Fairbanks had been to Shanghai last year. He was quite delighted to revisit the old place and shook hands with those who welcomed him and exchanged greetings with a smile. His expression was as if he had just stepped out of the silver screen. Mr. and Mrs. Moy will host a tea party at the Cathay Hotel tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome him. He will leave Shanghai at 6:00 PM that evening and travel south all the way, passing through Singapore and going to Siam for hunting. According to Mr. Fairbanks, he may return to Shanghai for another visit when he returns from his travels to fulfill his unfinished interests. If so, then the time for Mr. Fairbanks' third visit to Shanghai may not be far off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Announces the Reason for Salty Tap Water</h3>
<p>▲No Harm to Drinking</p>
<p>The tap water in Zhabei often has a salty taste at this time of year, and citizens often do not understand the reason and misunderstand. Recently, someone asked the Municipal Health Bureau about the cause of the salty tap water and whether it is harmful to drinking. According to the bureau, the reason for the salty taste is actually due to the low water level of the river, which allows seawater to intrude. A strong salty taste also occurred two years ago. The saltiest day was January 9, 1929, when the salt content reached more than 2,700 parts per million, which took three weeks to subside. In the past few days of this year, a salty taste has been detected again. The highest salt content in the water is also more than 2,000 parts per million. On the 5th of this month, the Municipal Health Laboratory sampled the water for testing, and the salt content was still 985 parts per million, which is far different from the usual 20 parts per million, resulting in a very salty taste. However, the number of bacteria and the amount of *E. coli* in the water, as well as other chemical components, are still the same as usual and still meet the Shanghai drinking water hygiene standards, so there is no harm to drinking. As for the salty taste in the tap water, there is currently no scientific method to remove it. However, the intrusion of seawater into the river is very short each year, so it is expected to recover soon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ferry to Add Extra Shifts Starting Today</h3>
<p>▲Two Extra Shifts in the Morning... Three Extra Shifts in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ferry, operating between Nanjing Road Bund and Pudong Donggou, has excellent equipment and stable speed since the launch of the new No. 3 and No. 4 ferries, and the number of passengers is increasing daily. In order to meet the needs, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities will add the recently repaired and docked No. 2 ferry, starting today. It is reported that one shift will be added at 9:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 2:30 PM, 3:30 PM, and 4:30 PM, for a total of five extra shifts, to facilitate travel and to test whether the ferry is more suitable after being repaired and renovated.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rob Fabric</h3>
<p>▲Shipowner Wounded</p>
<p>▲Loss of Five Thousand Taels</p>
<p>Fang Ji, a fabric merchant from Chonghai, hired Wang Maolang's Chongsha boat to transport 500 packages of fabric to Shanghai for sale. Wu, a clerk from the shop, was assigned to escort the goods. On the 5th, while sailing on the Jiwo Port waters of Tongzhou, two pirate boats suddenly appeared and fired shots to order them to stop. Two of Wang's crew members were wounded by bullets. Wang had no choice but to lower the sail and stop the boat. The pirates swarmed onto the boat and robbed all the silver dollars. Not satisfied, they forced Wang's boat to sail to Tongzhou, with the two pirate boats following and monitoring them. When they sailed to a seaport, they were forced to dock, and the fabric on the boat was moved to the two pirate boats. When Wu saw the pirates moving the fabric, he pleaded with them to stop, but this angered the pirates, who shot him in the back. The two pirate boats then sailed away into the East China Sea. Wang's boat has now sailed to the mouth of the Liu River and sent Wu and the two crew members to the hospital for treatment. One of the crew members is in critical condition. Yesterday, Wang came to Shanghai to report the incident. The fabric merchants immediately telegraphed the Chonghai shop to inform them and began taking stock of the fabric. It is reported that the stolen fabric is worth 5,000 taels.</p>
<h3>The First Route of China Merchants Public Buses Changes Stop</h3>
<p>The transportation situation on the section from Chizhi University north to Hechang Oil Factory on the first route of the Shanghai China Merchants Public Buses has changed since the Aiguo Girls' School and Yonggu Paint Factory moved to Chenyuan Road in Jiangwan one after another. After inspecting the area, officials from the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities felt that although there was a hailing stop on Chenyuan Road, the fares and distances were not balanced. In order to meet the needs, the company was ordered to change the hailing stop near Chenyuan Road to a formal stop, and the stop in front of Chizhi University was changed to a hailing stop for adjustment.</p>
<h3>Wife Denies Husband</h3>
<p>▲Luo Wenyi and Sun Huaiying Compete for Wife</p>
<p>Luo Wenyi, a villager from Haizhou, is 32 years old and has been farming in the countryside for a living. His wife, Wang, is currently 31 years old. Luo was engaged to her when he was seven years old, and she was brought into his family as a child bride. They grew up together and were quite harmonious. At the age of 21, they officially married, and the love between the couple was very strong. She worked diligently alongside her husband, farming the land. However, in the first month of the lunar calendar last year, Wang was suddenly abducted by a fellow villager and disappeared without a trace. Luo searched everywhere without success. After repeated investigations, he learned from Wang Jiayou, a relative of Wang working in Shanghai, that Wang had become acquainted with a fellow villager named Sun and was cohabitating with him behind Xinsen Lane, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Wang Jiayou immediately sent a letter to Luo. Luo, along with his brother-in-law Wang Hongzhi, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM, Luo and Wang Jiayou and others went to the 6th District Police Station to report the incident. The police immediately dispatched officers along with the complainants to the address. At the time, Wang and her paramour Sun Huaiying were both taken back to the station. District Chief Ren interrogated the accused. The plaintiff Luo Wenyi testified that he was 32 years old, and the rest of his testimony was as described above. Wang Jiayou testified that he was 27 years old and from Taizhou, and that Wang was indeed Luo's wife, and that Sun Huaiying had abducted her and they were cohabitating was true. Wang Hongzhi testified that he was 27 years old, from Taizhou, and that Wang was his sister and had married Luo Wenyi. The defendant Wang falsely claimed that her surname was Sun and her given name was Xi, that she was 31 years old, that she and Sun Huaiying were husband and wife, and that she did not know Luo Wenyi. Sun Huaiying testified that he was 28 years old, that Wang was his wife, and the rest of his testimony was vague. After hearing the testimonies, District Chief Ren believed that Wang had her younger brother and husband present as witnesses, yet she dared to deny the facts, which was truly despicable. She was sentenced to be sent to court for trial after the documents were prepared.</p>
<h3>Four Japanese Injure a Compatriot</h3>
<p>▲Injured Man Sent to Hospital, Assailant Detained</p>
<p>On Sunday night, a Japanese man named Yamamoto was lured by four Japanese compatriots to take a walk near Jing'an Temple Road. In the process, they struck him severely on the head and body with an iron object, inflicting a total of nineteen wounds. Yamamoto immediately lost consciousness. Believing that he had died, they tied his feet tightly with hemp rope and abandoned him in the field. About an hour later, Yamamoto regained consciousness and crawled to the roadside to call for help. A Westerner from the Electric Power Company happened to be passing by in a car and took him to the Red Cross Hospital. On his way back, he encountered a Japanese policeman from the Jing'an Temple Police Station and told him what had happened. The Japanese policeman rushed to investigate and reported it to the Japanese Consulate. The next morning, the four men were arrested. It is heard that one was surnamed Goto, one was surnamed Kazuno, one was surnamed Aino, and one was surnamed Matsumoto. They had arrived in Shanghai with Yamamoto on the Shanghai Maru on the 30th of last month. Because they knew each other, after landing, the four men stayed at the Katsuta Hotel, and Yamamoto stayed at the Hinomaru Hotel. Soon after, they rented a house together in the French Concession. It is not known why, but a tragic murder occurred. Yamamoto has now been transferred to the Fukumin Hospital and is not in danger of death. The four assailants are being detained at the Japanese Consulate, where the case is being investigated.</p>
<h3>Rental Dispute in the French Concession's Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>▲Social Bureau Orders Original Plan to be Followed</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Tenants' Association presented a petition to the Municipal Government regarding the private collection of small rents and the raising of rent by the Tongren Fuyuantang for the houses in Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Neighborhoods, requesting that the Municipal Government order them to voluntarily reduce the rent. The Municipal Government instructed the Social Bureau to investigate and handle the matter. The bureau stated that the collection of small rents had long been prohibited, and that the Tongren Fuyuantang, as a well-known charity organization, should not charge extra fees. The bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. According to the organization, it had collected donations for charitable activities from tenants in Zhizhong and Lixian Neighborhoods and had reduced rents in the past. An investigation revealed that the houses were built with borrowed funds, and the rental income was used to repay the debts. The organization had already specified the distribution of rental income from the three neighborhoods when applying for construction, which was related to the loan guarantee and should not be changed arbitrarily to affect the debt. As for the donation issue, the bureau had no records to verify. However, since the tenants voluntarily paid donations in the past, why did they now complain about it? Was it a deliberate attempt to resist rent or was there some other reason? It was impossible to speculate. Furthermore, the increase or decrease in the income of charitable organizations is related to the rise and fall of relief efforts. It is not permissible to arbitrarily abandon the legitimate interests of public property. Moreover, houses should be rented out after a contract is signed. Some tenants in Zhizhong and other neighborhoods moved in before signing a contract, and some regretted after signing a contract, which was not appropriate. It is heard that in addition to submitting a report, the bureau has ordered the Shanghai Charitable Organization to collect rent from the Zhizhong and Lixian neighborhoods starting from January 1 of this year according to the contract and not allow tenants to delay payment for any reason, so as to prevent abuses. Those who have not signed a contract should be required to sign a supplementary contract within a limited time. The five-year validity period was also not included in the original plan. The organization was also ordered to report the handling situation truthfully for verification.</p>
<h3>Case of Robbery on Jiangyin Street Solved</h3>
<p>▲Chen Defu and Ge Tingyin Confess that Zhong Mao Initiated the Robbery</p>
<p>Shan Bin and Ding Shunbao, detectives from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's detective team, suddenly received a tip-off that the bandits who had robbed the residents Qian Houzhang and Wu Shaoyuan at 32 Shengri Lane, Jiangyin Street, Nanshi, on the 30th of last month were now hiding in the area of Xieqiao Lujiabang. They were asked to arrest them quickly. Shan and Ding immediately reported to Team Leader Lu and dispatched detectives Han Jingxiang and Chen Jiren to go together. Chen Defu and Ge Tingyin were arrested on the spot. After strict interrogation, the two criminals confessed that the case was initiated by Zhong Si and Mao Hongxi. More than 40 yuan were robbed in total, but they did not get a share. They begged for leniency. Team Leader Lu immediately prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for verification.</p>
<h3>Reward Offered for the Arrest of Li Shude</h3>
<p>▲A Wanted Criminal in a Murder for Money Case</p>
<p>Li Bolu's family at 3 Xingyou Lane, Zixia Road, outside Dadongmen, had a distant grandson named Li Shude who came from afar with a friend speaking with a Hunan accent and wearing a military uniform in January of this year. Bolu invited them to lunch, and then Bolu took his daughter out for errands, leaving only his wife, Yao, and his distant grandson Li Shude and his friend at home. When Bolu returned home at 5:00 PM, the doors were wide open, and no one was there, but he did not notice anything unusual. Then, he found his wife Yao strangled to death with a rope in the kitchen shed. An inventory of the property revealed that it had all been stolen. It was undoubtedly the wicked grandson Li Shude and an unknown man from Hunan who conspired to murder for money and fled. The Public Security Bureau had already offered a reward of 300 yuan to arrest the wicked and immoral criminal Li Shude and the unknown man from Hunan, but they had not yet been apprehended. Recently, Li Bolu submitted a petition to the Public Security Bureau, stating that he would voluntarily add an additional 200 yuan to the reward, as the soul could not rest in peace until the criminals were caught. He asked for a public notice to be issued, stating that if anyone could arrest the fugitive criminals or provide information leading to the arrest of the principal offender, the reward would be paid in full and kept in storage, with no intention of reneging on the promise. He also attached 20 photos of Li Shude and asked them to be posted on the notice. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau issued the notice.</p>
<h3>Bandits Arrested at Yuelai Hotel</h3>
<p>Cao Xirong, a detective from the Wayside Police Station, along with French police, arrested a Ningbo man named Tang Xingfa (also known as Xiao Xingfa) at the Yuelai Hotel on West Xinqiao Street.

Yesterday, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Xiao. The defendant completely denied the charges. He was ordered to be detained temporarily, pending the summoning of Chen Afang and others, and Wang Ada, to be questioned again.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Receives Extortion Letter</h3>
<p>▲Extortionist Shen Chenghua Arrested</p>
<p>Zheng Ayu, the owner of Yusheng Hongji Carpentry Shop in Zhabei, suddenly received three extortion letters ten days ago. The letters also included a pistol bullet and demanded 3,000 yuan, under the name of the Youth League. Zheng was terrified after receiving the letters and discussed the matter with his friends. Cao Jinda, the leader of the detectives in the 2nd District of Nanshi, learned about the matter and immediately supervised the detectives to investigate. A few days ago, they found that the criminals were hiding at 5 Hongxiang Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. They arrested Shen Chenghua on the spot without making a scene. After strict interrogation, Shen confessed that he was 25 years old and from Cixi, Zhejiang. He completely denied the case. Team Leader Cao ordered him to write a letter and compared the handwriting. It was indeed the same as the previous three letters. Shen then confessed that all three letters to Zheng were indeed written by him. The matter was initiated by a Huangyan man named Zhang Laoda, and he conspired with an unknown local man. Zhang said that he would give him 100 yuan as a reward after the matter was completed. The third letter originally agreed to meet at the Xiaoxiao Building at the corner of Lujiabang, at the east end of Xieqiao Road, Nanshi, but before it could be implemented, he was arrested. Team Leader Cao reported to District Chief Wang and prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for verification.</p>
<h3>New World Property Rent Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲Is it Five Thousand Taels or Five Thousand Dollars?</p>
<p>▲The Court Orders Advance Payment of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The New World Amusement Park at the Mud City Bridge Pier stopped operating after the May Thirtieth Massacre. It was rented to British military authorities to garrison British troops for several years. Until the winter before last year, when the British troops stationed in Shanghai withdrew, it was still used as an entertainment venue. A foreigner leased it from the landlord, Yuan Ji Agency, for a monthly rent of five thousand taels. Three months later, Xu Yaoxiang took over the entertainment business and defaulted on the rent since May of last year. By September, for five months, not a penny was paid. Yuan Ji sued Xu in the Special District Court, seeking to recover 25,000 taels in back rent. Xu argued that the monthly rent was not five thousand taels, but five thousand yuan. After the debate concluded, Xu lost the case. Dissatisfied, Xu filed an appeal. The second instance has not yet been decided, and the rent has been in arrears for another four months from October to January of this year. Yuan Ji sued again. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren of the Special Court summoned the defendant, who hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, saying that when the plaintiff rented the house to a foreigner, the monthly rent was indeed five thousand taels of silver. Later, when the defendant continued the lease, he made it clear to the landlord that it was a long-term lease, not a short-term rent like that of a foreigner. He requested that the silver amount be changed to the dollar amount. Although no lease was signed, many people knew about it. Therefore, the previous months were paid at five thousand yuan each time, but the landlord still issued rent receipts for five thousand taels. He requested corrections, but the landlord said that the amount on the rent receipt was greater than the amount paid by the tenant, which did not harm the tenant. Therefore, he did not insist on changing it. Unexpectedly, after a few months, the landlord used the rent receipts as evidence to demand a monthly rent of five thousand taels from the tenant. The means are truly cunning, and so on. Chen Jingbo, the accountant of Yuan Ji Agency, testified that the monthly rent was indeed five thousand taels, paid in advance. The defendant initially paid five thousand taels for several months, and so on. He also hired a lawyer to argue. Judge Zhou advised both parties to reconcile. Before a final judgment is made on the appeal in the previous case, the defendant was ordered to temporarily pay five thousand yuan per month. After the appeal case is finalized, if five thousand taels must be paid, then it will be made up month by month. As for the four months of rent owed in this case, totaling 20,000 yuan, the defendant was ordered to pay 10,000 yuan within the old year and 10,000 yuan by the end of January next year. Starting from February in the solar calendar, monthly payments must be made as scheduled, without delay. Both parties followed the court order and settled the case.</p>

When it was noon yesterday, the shipowner knew that the time was late and the crew members were still in bed. Knowing that something was wrong, he quickly lifted the cabin boards and shouted loudly. He only saw smoke filling the cabin, which smelled nauseating. When he touched the two boatmen, their faces were pale and their bodies were cold.

<h3>The Useless Depression of the American Automobile Industry by Cheng Zhizheng</h3>
<p>▲The Depression is Due to the Business Cycle</p>
<p>▲A Three-Year Cycle May Turn This Year</p>
<p>▲Forsdike Announces Relief Plan</p>
<p>▲President Hoover Also Cannot Prevent It</p>
<p>Not long ago. I (the original author refers to himself, and the following will follow this usage) went to attend the annual meeting of automotive engineers in this city. Originally. Every time the annual meeting came around. Everyone was always very happy. Even if there was any speech. It was nothing more than telling humorous and funny stories. Or reporting happy memories of the past year. But this year's annual meeting. But it was very different. Everyone met and talked about the depression. And during the meeting. Everyone was silent. With a double-locked frown. The air around suddenly changed from pleasant to bleak. This thing is really amazing.</p>
<p>Especially interesting. Was a few of the speeches. They all thought that business had reached a terrible point. And this depression. I don't know when it will end. One of them said it most comically. He said. "If you have something to do. Then. I advise you not to easily leave it. Because once you leave it. You will immediately have nothing to do. In other words. It is also to join the ranks of the unemployed. If you are really unfortunate and leave your job. You should not wait for opportunities in the city. Go back to the countryside to see the cattle and sheep. Wait until the period of commercial revival. Then come out again." At that time. Everyone listened and couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>In order to participate in this annual meeting. I couldn't help but think of things from the past. When in December 1914. The European War broke out. Everyone was worried. Thinking that the entire European market would fall. And that the losses would be incalculable. However. After a few months. Not only was the United States' trade with Europe unaffected. And it suddenly took off. Breaking the unprecedented record. The reason is that during the war, the production tools of various countries. Were transformed into munitions. Unable to supply the needs. The United States took the opportunity to gain a lot of benefits. In 1921. The commercial depression was brewed again. But after three or four months. It returned to its original state. If we calculate from 1880. To 1930. Then. In these fifty-two years. The years of depression are as follows. 1884丨5 years. 1893丨4 years. 1896丨7丨8 years. 1904. 1908. 192 years. 1914. 1921. 1924. 1927.</p>
<p>There are also times when the depression. Is due to psychological effects. For example, after the end of the Great War in 1919. Everyone thought that the treaties between the Allied countries. Would be abolished uniformly. The war debts are also not recognized. In this way. Commerce will inevitably suffer damage. So as soon as the rumors started. The customers didn't dare to buy too much either. The factory didn't dare to produce too much either. How could anyone know that the Allied countries' war debts. Were not cancelled. Instead, they rushed to place orders everywhere. This belongs to the psychologically caused depression.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of prosperity and decline. Is called the business cycle in commerce. Its nature is like winter and summer. It is cyclical. It can also be compared to the tide. It is constantly circulating. A year or two ago. Some optimistic car merchants. Sang a high pitch. Said that the theory of the business cycle. Has been broken. In the future, the United States will definitely be able to maintain satisfactory results every year. And continue to develop forward. But what about now. The depression is finally here again. Who can explain that it is not due to the law of the business cycle.</p>
<p>The business cycle is especially prominent in automobiles. If we look at it with a graph. Then. Sometimes it increases and sometimes it decreases. It is like an iron law. Although we say that the business cycle can be compared to the tides and seasons. However, there is one fundamental difference. Because the tides and seasons can have a certain period of time. Can be predictable. And the business cycle. Is impossible to predict. It has neither a fixed interval of years. There is no same situation before and after. Generally speaking, before a major business depression. There are a few things that are most obvious. The stock must fall in price. Prices are lowered. At the same time, interest rates also fall sharply from high to low. Similarly, at the beginning of the recovery period. The stock rises first. Then many things also follow it high.</p>
<p>Last year, the securities in the United States fell terribly. This year, more than a thousand banks have collapsed again. This depression has begun. Last fall. When the market was sluggish. The President of the United States, Hoover, convened a meeting with the automotive tycoon Ford and other leaders in the business world to discuss countermeasures. And several methods were agreed upon. However, it was ultimately ineffective. Industry and commerce. Gradually sinking. But when can it be recovered. No one can make a definitive statement. Some people say. Judging from history. The current depression. May be about to recover. Because from the beginning to now. It has been sixteen months. There is no reason not to turn around. But from the perspective of experts, this special cycle. Cannot recover until the end of 1931. After generally discussing the depression in the United States. I will talk about the automobile itself. If according to experts' estimates. Then. In 1931, the automobile industry. Will of course also be trapped in the depression. However. The prosperity and decline of the automobile industry. Although it cannot completely get rid of the business cycle. However, it also has some special points. The increase and decrease in the automobile industry. Is about once every three years. After the end of the three years. The following year. Must be the year of the most development in the industry. From a historical point of view. 1921 was a year of reduced production. In 1922, it created an unprecedented record. Now 1927 to 1930 were all years of reduced production. Calculated, it has been exactly three years. 1931 may have</p>
<h3>Flying Display Factory's Large Press Machine - Auspicious</h3>
<p>Often the panels, edges, or rear ends of automobile bodies show uneven places, which are very unsightly. This is not a defect in the paint material, but because the steel was not in compliance with the law when it was formed. If pure steel plates are used and pressed with a fine machine, there will be no such defects. The Flying Display Body Factory of the General Motors Manufacturing Plant in the United States has recently installed a large new press hinge machine, which is specially used for pressing and refreshing steel sheets. The old style could only press one piece at a time, but now even two or three pieces can be done at the same time. And its results are far better than before.</p>
<p>The press machine shown in the picture is more accurate and exquisite than other types. The Flying Display Factory now has 14 of these machines, each weighing 400 tons. And it has a pressure of 1,300 tons. It can simultaneously generate four kinds of significant sliding movements at a time. Therefore, it is called a four-sided sliding press hinge machine.</p>
<p>This new four-sided sliding press machine can make large steel sheets with the shortest joints. Therefore, the surface is not only smooth and flat, but also has no uneven ripples. And its overall strength is stronger than other long-section press machines.</p>
<p>The steel plate produced by the large press machine has a clean surface and accurate curvature. Therefore, the base of the car body made by the Flying Display Factory is of excellent quality and has a beautiful appearance. This is why General Motors is satisfied.</p>
<p>This machine has strong capabilities and is competent to press the hardest and most bulky steel. However, its working time is shortened and the cost is saved. Compared with the old-style machines, it is about ten times more. Therefore, General Motors customers also get economic benefits.</p>

<p>Special development.</p>
<p>However. One thing is worth noting. Is that the current automobile market. Is a "replacement market" rather than a "new purchase market." What does this mean. At present, the automobile industry in the United States and even Europe. 橤职 is developed. Almost one in every four or five people has a car. So unless the old car is broken. Don't buy a new car. It is called "replacement market." Rather than a "new purchase market." The development of the replacement market. Is ultimately very limited. Unless you really create a "new purchase market." The automobile industry. It is ultimately difficult to create an unprecedented record. So I dare say. The automobile trade in 1931. May be better than 1930. However. It is not the most victorious year. In short. The current world depression. Is a natural cycle. It is not a novel strange thing. As for the automobile industry. It is indeed governed by natural cycles. But its law of cycle is different from ordinary business. It is probably once every three years. Counting to 1931, it should recover. But because automobiles in the United States have reached their highest point. The development in 1931. Is still in the "replacement market." I also talked about this matter with Rubber King Forsdike. I asked him what he thought. Mr. Forsdike smiled and said. "I have a way. That is, everyone should build more cheap and beautiful cars." He also said, "The manufacturers have been really anxious these months. Now there is no other way. Only find ways to improve the goods.</p>
<h3>Ford's New Truck</h3>
<p>The diagram shows the new type of truck that Ford Motor Company is promoting for sale. Its wheelbase is divided into two types: 131.5 inches and 157 inches. Whether or not to install rear wheels is optional.</p>
<p>Objects. And sell at reduced prices. I believe. With the new production methods. The cost can always be reduced a little. This is also a way to relieve the depression."</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Road Administration News from Various Provinces - Wu Fei</h3>
<p>▲ Jiangsu Province: Jiangsu Province is actively and tirelessly engaged in conscripting labor for road construction. The most important recent projects are approximately as follows: (1) The Department of Construction is prioritizing the construction of the Provincial-Ju Road, specifically a section of about ten li from the provincial capital's train station to Huiyuan Temple.

Engineers have been dispatched to survey the route, with a deadline of three months for completion. Construction is expected to begin in the fourth month and is projected to be completed in two years, providing direct access to Guizhou and Guangxi provinces.</p>
<p>▲ Xinjiang Province: Xinjiang Province is located in the remote northwest, with vast deserts and rugged roads. It is appropriate to start with transportation. Therefore, the original official roads are being slightly repaired to serve as motor roads. However, due to poor road conditions, vehicles are frequently damaged. The provincial government has appointed a commissioner and hired engineers to conduct a preliminary survey. The motor road from Dihua to Gucheng is four hundred and seventy-three li long, with an estimated cost of over one thousand taels of provincial silver. Meanwhile, personnel have been dispatched to supervise the construction, and three thousand engineering soldiers are being allocated from various regiments stationed in the Dihua-Gucheng area, divided into four groups, to begin construction. The construction of the roads from Gucheng to Hami and Xingxing Gorge will follow sequentially.</p>
<p>▲ Jilin Province: Jilin Province has the Ji-Hai, Ji-Chang, and Ji-Dun roads open to traffic. There are very few cars. Recently, the Construction Bureau plans to build highways, sending personnel to various counties to investigate, survey, and construct, so that minerals can be exploited, industries developed, and transportation facilitated in all seasons.</p>
<p>The above covers the provinces that are known. Other provinces will be discussed in further installments as information becomes available.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Bandits - Ke Ci</h3>
<p>That morning, at only four o'clock, A-Da was awakened by a rustling sound. He thought, "Here they come again." Indeed, recently rats had often been making noise in their room at night, not only disturbing their sleep but also gnawing a large piece out of the spine of A-Da's newly bought book. This was what A-Da hated the most.</p>
<p>There was really no way to deal with it. A-Da had bought a mousetrap, hoping to reduce the number of rats, but coincidentally, these rats wouldn't eat the bait, so it had no chance to work. A-Da had to seal the rat holes, hoping to prevent the rats from coming out, but the rats' abilities were truly vast. Before long, they immediately reopened a hole. A-Da thought, perhaps if he got a cat, the rats wouldn't come out again, right? A cat was found soon after, but it didn't work either. Often, even the cat's food at night was eaten by the rats. A-Da had no choice but to stare blankly at the rat hole, gnashing his teeth and thinking.</p>
<p>"Here they come again," A-Da said to himself after being awakened by the sound of rats gnawing on things. "I'm going to give you a taste of your own medicine." So he got up silently, sealed the rat holes, closed the door, and then—</p>
<p>"A-Er, get up, help me catch rats," he said, turning on the light.</p>
<p>Their only weapons were iron hooks and iron pokers. The rats were driven out of the bookshelf by them and ran frantically around the room, making it impossible for A-Da and A-Er to hit them. Finally, "Let's pile the boxes into a corner and trap the rats inside, then it will be easy to hit the dummies," A-Da came up with an idea and suggested doing that. After passing the suggestion, they piled the boxes up, forming a corner with the wall.</p>
<p>"You wait here, if the rat comes, you hit it," A-Da instructed A-Er. He himself went around the room chasing them. The rats were actually chased into the corner. A-Er struck, but missed. The rat ran onto the wall. A-Da aimed and rushed over with a strike. With a crash, it was sure to hit. Just one hit would knock the rat down. But no, he only made a hole in the wall. Another strike, and he still missed. By this time, he was laughing so hard he couldn't close his mouth. He thought, he was actually fighting the rats like he was suppressing bandits. The rats, at this time, disappeared, hiding somewhere.</p>
<p>Searching, searching everywhere. Under the bed, under the table, in the bookshelf, in the corner—they searched everywhere, but they couldn't find the "fugitive" rat.</p>
<p>"Maybe it slipped away through that hole,"</p>
<p>"No, all the holes in this room are sealed,"</p>
<p>"Then where did it go?"</p>
<p>"Search again, it can't have left the room,"</p>
<p>A-Da took a flashlight and searched everywhere, but still nothing. Finally—</p>
<p>"Ah, here it is!" When he shone the light behind the bookshelf, he discovered a rat hiding in a pile of magazines. He unceremoniously struck it with a stick—he had now switched to a stick—and hit it. He really hit it, but because of the books blocking the way, the rat wasn't hurt and instead charged out, startling A-Da.</p>
<p>"Oh, there are two of them, there are two of them!"</p>
<p>"It's really strange, when there were none, there weren't even one, but now that there are some, there are two." They chased, the rats fled, but they still couldn't hurt them.</p>
<p>"Come quickly, come quickly, I've got a rat trapped!" A-Er shouted. At this time, one of the rats was trapped by him with the window, but the rat was still able to move. It climbed out of the gap, onto the edge of the wall. A-Da struck it with a stick, knocking it onto the bookshelf, and then another strike ended its life. A-Da triumphantly pulled it out from behind the bookshelf. "Can you still run now, Mr. Rat?" A-Da said involuntarily, feeling the tension of his spirit, the contraction of his muscles, and the joy of revenge. But immediately, he thought, if he were being chased and beaten to near death, how resentful and sad would he be? He couldn't help but pity it.</p>
<p>But this thought disappeared immediately, and they began to catch the second one. The second one was actually captured alive, having been pinned down by a hot water bottle. Without hesitation, A-Da picked it up and stuffed it into the spittoon. That rat was "executed" in this way. They carried it outside, dug a hole, and buried it.</p>
<p>The next day, A-Er said, "My hand got cut last night." A-Da didn't say anything. He was lying in bed, panting—he had caught a cold last night.</p>
<h3>After Unemployment - Hui</h3>
<p>The pain that unemployment brings to a person is like a heavy fog descending upon a ship at sea. Even with a powerful engine and a clever, experienced captain, there is nothing that can be done. I am young, strong, and fairly intelligent, and I have enjoyed a considerable amount of education through my own efforts. But life is sneering and mocking me, a drifter with no power in society. I haven't had a day of peace. The life of this society has given me a lot of training. I will try my best to scrape and bow to find any job to do. I don't dislike any job because it's too unpalatable or too humiliating to my talent, just like my poor stomach. I swallow whatever food I get, without ever disliking the sweet, sour, bitter, or spicy. However, the jobs that I can find with my meager strength are always short-term jobs like repairing roads. The road collapses, they ask you to repair it. Once it's repaired, I'm back to being a wandering vagrant on the road.</p>
<p>The weather these days is severely cold, with white clouds pressing down on the sky. The sharp wind is howling everywhere. You don't need to be a prophet to know that it will snow soon. The cold doesn't limit my work ethic. Even heavy clouds and rain are like mild, sunny skies to me. But when I return to my small room, wandering the streets like a homeless dog because I can't find a job, I suddenly feel exhausted, like a bow that has lost its string. I lie on the bed, staring at the ceiling, without even wanting to look at the books I enjoy reading. Besides, the easy-to-digest books have all been read in the past few days. All that's left are a few stiff theoretical books. I fully feel that everything is unfriendly to me, everything is sneering at me.</p>
<p>Normally, I always sleep at midnight and get up at seven in the morning to work. But now I'm completely out of sync. I even go to sleep six hours early. When dusk peeks into my window, I can sleep until eleven o'clock the next day, like ordinary Shanghai people. It's as if getting up at this time is still too early. I lazily go to get some hot water to wash my face.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think, "Oh, this is too decadent." "No, no," I reply forcefully, "it's because I feel like there's nothing to do."</p>
